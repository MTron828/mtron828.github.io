Chapter 1266 - Kill!

Lin Yun’s voice was resounding as he glowed like a bright sun with his vitality soaring over. Although he called himself an ant, everyone could tell that he was mocking those from the big sects.

“You!”

“You’re the one who killed an Azure Thunder Sect’s disciple!” Those people from the big sects exclaimed with their faces changed because they had long learned that Lin Yun had previously killed disciples of the Azure Thunder Sect and Flame Dragon Sect.

Their fellow martial disciples died a terrible death, and they learned that it was an azure-clothed swordsman carrying a sword box behind him and that he was proficient in thunderstorms. Not only did he possess the azure dragon aura, but he also grasped a terrifying body-refining technique. All the descriptions were the similar to Lin Yun, and this made them feel unreal. After all, they could tell that Lin Yun was only at the Galaxy Stage and hadn’t that he hasn’t even manifested his constellation.

But Lin Yun was emitting a domineering aura. Not only did he not escape, but he even provoked them. One must know that the foot of the mountain had a pile of corpses, and five geniuses were defeated just a moment ago. But Lin Yun appeared out of nowhere and easily suppressed his opponent.

This scene also made the other Empyreans there feel their blood boiling. This was the first time someone so strongly challenged the big sects, especially the Empyreans from the Ancient Barren Domain. Many of their companions died from the disciples of the big sects. The disciples of the big sects were overbearing and ruthless, killing everyone who dared to intrude.

They could only watch the disciples of the big sects gather the saint liquid and even badly humiliated them. When they saw Lin Yun stand out, this made everyone’s blood boil and they placed their hopes on him.

As for Lin Yun, he was calm as he circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art. As lightning began to flicker around him, he slowly walked toward the mountain with a terrifying azure dragon aura spreading out. This also made the face of everyone on the mountain change because they could sense how troublesome Lin Yun was.

“Inform the other sects to assist us. We have to kill him here. We can’t let him have the Dragon Blood Fruit.” The woman from the Flame Dragon Sect wielding the whip transmitted her voice to the other disciples before she said with a smile, “I think there’s a misunderstanding. With your strength, even if you’re not not from a big sect, you’re also qualified to compete for the Dragon Blood Fruit. We have no intention of making you an enemy. You’re a transcendent genius, so you’re unlike those ants. We’re family, and we can accept you, allowing you to gather saint liquid along with competing for the Dragon Blood Fruit as long as you oblige to our rapport.”

Lin Yun could tell that she was lying, noticing the disdain and killing intent in her eyes. In reality, the big sects were after geniuses like Lin Yun. After all, the Ancient Barren Domain was too big, and there were geniuses who possessed unbelievable strength, despite the fact that they weren’t from big sects.

Quasi-saint elixirs were rare, and they didn’t have enough of them. So how could they allow anyone else get them? As long as they managed to hold Lin Yun back for the time being, this would give time for the other sects to rush over and kill Lin Yun. At that time, not only could they reduce a competitor without paying any price, they could even search for the secret techniques he had on him.

When the other Empyreans heard what the woman said, they instantly became furious because of how hypocritical she was. She wanted to pull Lin Yun to her side after seeing how strong he was.

At the same time, someone from the mountain hid his aura and wanted to inform the other big sects. But right at that moment, Lin Yun’s gaze became sharp and made that person feel a chill down his spine, “I’ve already said that I’m here to seek some guidance. So none of you are allowed to leave!”

“Who the hell do you think you are? Do you think we’ll accept a barbarian like you? I’ve already spread the news out and the other big sects will come to deal with you.” The person who was eyed by Lin Yun was mocked.

“I said that no one is allowed to leave without my permission,” Lin Yun calmly said.

“You think you can make me stay?” That person mocked before he turned into a streak, wanting to head back to their camp and ask an elder from his sect to suppress Lin Yun. Big sects and powerful sects were the same. They have sent their Dragon Pulse Realm and even Samsara Edict Realm experts over.

The big sects had a silent agreement amongst them, but they wouldn’t bother about a mere barbarian. No one said that they couldn’t seek help from their elders.

But Lin Yun executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformation, instantly chasing after the latter, and raised his hand in order to suppress him. This made everyone’s hearts tremble because Lin Yun’s speed was a little too unbelievable.

At the same time, lightning exploded with a bright sun rising from Lin Yun’s palm. When he pushed his palm out, it was like a dragon claw that covered the sun.

“Arrgggghhhh!” That person let out a scream. He had already summoned his constellation and even used his holy spirit martial technique, but his efforts were futile. Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Art was too strong, especially after refining the saint rune in the Blood Flame Dragon Gold Rune, divine dragon aura, and blood essence in the Nine Li Illusion Realm altar, not to mention that he had been brewing this attack for a long time.

Before him, the Empyrean from the Azure Thunder Sect was torn apart like a piece of paper. When Lin Yun was done, he returned to his original position as if he hadn’t moved from his spot. At the same time, he walked forth with his voice echoing, “Ant Lin Yun, wishes to get some guidance from you eagles!”

As he walked towards the mountain, his fighting spirit began to soar into the sky. This scene also left all the Empyreans behind him dumbfounded while those on the mountain had their faces turn pale. They were from big sects, and they had a noble status. So since when have they been humiliated like this?

“You’re courting death!” A purple-clothed man from the Azure Thunder Sect couldn’t hold it back and took out a saint sword with lightning and flames enveloping it, looking like an azure moon. This was a saint artifact with azure lightning and flame merged into it. The flames in the sword looked like they were alive and weren’t at all inferior to any monarch saint artifact.

At the same time, the woman from the Flame Dragon Sect also couldn’t be bothered to wait and attacked with the whip in her hand.

“Kill!” Everyone on the mountain began to charge toward Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was enveloped in lightning that formed into an ocean. Then, an azure dragon flew out and blocked the sword in that purple-clothed youth’s hand. At the same time, he clenched his hands together, gathered all the dragon runes in his hand, then clashed with the whip head-on.

Just like that, a battle had broken out. Facing the experts of the two sects, Lin Yun was fearless. The disciples of the big sects without a saint artifact were instantly sent flying by Lin Yun with a single exchange.

This scene made all the Empyreans down below feel their blood boiling. They had been bearing it for a long time and were treated like ants. Not mention the Dragon Blood Fruit, but they weren’t even allowed to gather saint liquid. There was nothing they could do about the big sect’s blockade.

But justice ultimately existed in the world. At this moment, Lin Yun was the apostle of justice in their eyes, facing two monarch saint artifacts with the Azure Dragon Saint Art. he was enveloped in a purple-golden light that made him look like a bright sun as one disciple from the big sects after another were killed by his punches.

“Not even a monarch saint artifact can stop him?” All the Empyreans were dumbfounded. After all, not even an expert at the quasi-Elysium Core Realm could face monarch saint artifacts head-on, but Lin Yun was doing it so easily.

This was the foundation of the big sects, and this was the reason why they dared to act with such arrogance.

When Lin Yun threw out his punch, the saint sword was sent flying away before he waved his hand and enveloped that purple-clothed man in a thunderstorm. At the same time, Lin Yun unleashed a boundless thunderstorm toward the jiao-dragon manifested from the whip, tearing the jiao-dragon into pieces.

“What’s going on?” The woman from the Flame Dragon Sect’s face changed and quickly withdrew the whip. Just a moment ago, she could feel that she nearly lost control of the monarch saint artifact.

“Return to the sect and get elders to suppress him! We’ll see how long he can be arrogant for!” The disciples of the big sects were terrified by Lin Yun and turned to escape.

“Since you guys are eagles, how can eagles run from an ant? I advise you guys to return. Ant Lin Yun, wishes to get some guidance from you eagles!!” Lin Yun roared with his voice echoing like a divine dragon. As he shone brightly, his hair fluttered as he executed the Azure Dragon Grasp.

This instantly activated the Blood Flame Saint Rune. All the purple-golden dragon runes ignited on his body and gathered towards his palm. When a vortex appeared in his claw, it manifested into a colossal hand, instantly pulling everyone who fled towards him.

“N-N-No!” Those who were pulled back yelled out in fear. When he clenched his hand, all the holy spirits and constellations were instantly devoured. Everyone was dark, leaving only Lin Yun standing in mid-air. When he waved his hand, ten-odd corpses turned into a blood river and dissipated into the night.
