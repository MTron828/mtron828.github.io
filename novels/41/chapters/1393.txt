Chapter 1394 - You Can Try

Half an incense stick of time later, there still wasn’t an outcome from Feng Zhang and Jiang Xing’s fight. No one had expected that the battle between them would be this intense, and that a ‘barbarian,’ in their eyes, would be able to fight a genius from a saint clan.

This had surpassed everyone’s expectations, giving everyone a huge blow. This made everyone start to inquire about the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“They have a stage of difference in their cultivation, but why can’t Jiang Xing take down that Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect disciple? This is a little weird…”

“Don’t tell me that the talent of a Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect disciple is even greater than Jiang Xing?”

“Not too sure about that. Jiang Xing doesn’t seem to be using his full strength, which is baffling.” There were many people puzzled, including those from the Jiang Saint Clan.

“Jiang Xing, can you handle him? You’re embarrassing us! Let me deal with him if you’re having difficulty!” This man’s name was Jiang Shun. His talent was only secondary to Jiang Tian, so he had an arrogant personality.

“Big Brother Shun, you must be joking.” Jiang Xing said. “They’re simply barbarians, and I just don’t want to take advantage of him at my cultivation level. Others will only say that the saint clans are bullying them. But since you spoke out, then let’s put an end to this!”

It was true that he didn’t want to use the advantage of his cultivation against Feng Zhang. The reason why he fought so long was that he wanted to display his strength. As for a reason? This was because Jiang Tian and the others took all the limelight, so it was hard for him to enjoy the spotlight for once.

“Put an end to this? I don’t think you guys can do anything. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect isn’t something you people can touch!” Gongsun Yan finally lost his patience and laughed as he soared to the sky. As dazzling sword rays shone in his pupils, starlight bloomed before gathering into his palm and forming into a dazzling sun of sword rays.

When the sword ray reached a height, it instantly caught everyone’s attention. When the sword ray flew from his palm, the Jiang Saint Clan’s geniuses surrounding Liu Qingyan were all sent flying away.

“There’s nothing impressive about the Jiang Saint Clan!” Gongsun Yan laughed and charged towards the three.

“Sun Annihilation Cloud Pursuit!”

“Light of the Glory Sun!”

“Great Sun Divine Sword!”

The sword rays that he released were as dazzling as the sun as he used his fingers as a sword. The three geniuses of the Jiang Saint Clan tried to block his attack, but when Gongsun Yan’s attack landed on the astral energy around them, their astral energies were instantly dissolved by Gongsun Yan’s sword ray. The three geniuses threw out a mouthful of blood before they rolled down the stairs.

“What the hell? Where did this person come from?”

“It’s Gongsun Yan!”

“He was an ordinary genius back then. So why did he become so strong after reaching the Elysium Core Realm?”

“How did he and the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect get together? Just what the heck is the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? Aren’t they a little too strong?”

Gongsun Yan’s strength shocked everyone, making everyone feel unbelievable. He had some name when he was on the Empyrean Ranking. Still, he could suppress the saint clan’s geniuses after reaching the Elysium Core Realm, which made everyone feel unbelievable.

“Isn’t the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect a little too strong? They actually have the strength to face the Jiang Saint Clan!”

“Another three eliminated. It looks like it’s impossible to resolve this matter peacefully.” The other saint clan members locked their brows together because the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was a little too arrogant.

Lin Yun knew what kind of personality Gongsun Yan had. He was the kind of person who wouldn’t mind blowing things up. He was the kind who wouldn’t miss any opportunity to show off. But if he encounters a tough nut, he would immediately go down on his knees. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

So Lin Yun didn’t know where Gongsun Yan got the guts to provoke a Jiang Saint Clan. If the matter blew up, it would be impossible for him to clean up.

“We obtained a unique opportunity on the Profound Wither Island, and he’s a lot stronger now.” Zhao Yan explained. “He wants to show his strength to attract the attention of Sword Sect’s saints.”

“How dare you!” Jiang Shun instantly recognized Gongsun Yan and knew what kind of person Gongsun Yan was. But he never expected that Gongsun Yan would dare to face the Jiang Saint Clan. Even Jiang Tian’s face changed because he didn’t expect the matter to blow up to this extent.

“Big Brother Tian, Big Brother Shun, let me deal with him. That fellow lost to me before!” Jiang Ran, ranked sixth amongst the Jiang Saint Clan’s younger generation, made his move. He appeared before Gongsun Yan, pushing his palm out.

His palm had a freezing astral energy gathering within it, before it manifested into a black dragon that flew towards Gongsun Yan. This scene was simply too terrifying because the black dragon’s jaw was huge. Before Gongsun Yan could even respond, he was already swallowed by the black dragon.

“Hahaha! Pitiful tricks!” A burst of laughter resounded before Jiang Ran could smile. A hole then appeared on the black dragon that was created by thousands of golden sword rays before the black dragon exploded.

When Gongsun Yan appeared before everyone, he shone brightly like a vast sun, which changed Jiang Ran’s face. He didn’t expect Gongun Yan would be able to break free, and he coldly said, “Gongsun Yan, this has nothing to do with you. Do you want to face the entire Jiang Saint Clan by poking your nose into this matter?”

“Don’t overthink it. I just can’t stand how you guys treat the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect as barbarians. Since the Sword Sect is recruiting disciples, everyone can compete over it. So who are you guys to treat others as frogs in a well? Others might fear your Jiang Saint Clan, but not me!” Gongsun Yan laughed and attacked.

His attack caught Jiang Ran by surprise, forcing Jiang Ran to take several steps back. But when Jiang Ran let out a cold snort and fought Gongsun Yan, he was shocked to discover that he couldn’t get any advantage over the latter.

Simultaneously, while fighting Feng Zhang, Jiang Xing also released his cultivation and instantly obtained the advantage in the fight. When he swung his sword for the tenth time, Feng Zhang finally couldn’t bear it any longer and suffered a stab in his shoulder, forcing him to take several steps back with blood splashing out from the wound.

He was fortunate that he had refined the Golden Dragon Bone Soup with the membrane protecting him. So he had only suffered light injuries and wasn’t sent flying away. But even when Jiang Xing obtained an advantage against him, he had no intentions of letting Feng Zhang go.

Right then, ten-odd people flew out and surrounded Feng Zhang, Liu Qingyan, and Gongsun Yan. The Jiang Saint Clan naturally wouldn’t let this go without sending those who dared to provoke them down the stairs.

When Ye Ziling saw this scene, a cold light flashed through her pupils. She finally couldn’t hold it back and charged over, “Since the Jiang Saint Clan dares to bully and injure disciples of my Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, I won’t let this matter go so easily. Let me see how strong the Jiang Saint Clan is!”

Circulating the Dragon Blood Sword Sutra, Ye Ziling unleashed a sword ray enveloped in lightning the size of ten feet. As a dragon roar echoed, Ye Ziling looked like a divine dragon at this moment and instantly sent several Jiang Saint Clan’s disciples flying back.

Chaos ensued, which meant that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and Jiang Saint Clan had utterly flipped the table. When Zhao Yan saw this scene, he looked at Lin Yun before he sighed, “Looks like this battle is unavoidable.”

Lin Yun didn’t have much change on his face because he also had no choice. He didn’t want to offend a giant like the Jiang Saint Clan at the first stage, but Jiang Tao was simply too much. Jiang Tao was the one who didn’t learn from his lesson, and Lin Yun also didn’t think that Ye Ziling did anything wrong.

Even if Ye Ziling did something wrong, there was no way Lin Yun would just stand and watch. Since the matter had developed into this, he naturally had to stand out as a fellow disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

But Zhao Yan was a step further than him and charged forth. When he landed on the stairs, he immediately attacked by unleashing his sword aura. His gaze might seem dull, but the sword aura he released was terrifyingly strong.

His sword aura quickly separated everyone who was fighting, and he said, “Can’t we talk things out peacefully?”

Jiang Ran instantly recognized Zhao Yan and was surprised. He knew that Zhao Yan was also from a saint clan and a genius in the sword with the title “Sword Fanatic” given to him. So Jiang Ran replied, “Zhao Yan, are you going to interfere with us teaching these frogs in a well a lesson?”

“We’re not frogs in a well!” Feng Zhang flew into a rage and wanted to attack. The Jiang Saint Clan was too much to make them seem superior to others. So what if they were a saint clan?

“Am I wrong?” Jiang Ran mocked. “Don’t tell me that a tiny Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect wants to climb over my Jiang Saint Clan?”

Zhao Yan was surprised because he realized that the Jiang Saint Clan had no intention of admitting their wrongs. They didn’t think there was a wrong for a saint clan like them to teach a tiny sect from the countryside a lesson, and it was all written from the disdain plastered on their faces.

“It’s no wonder why the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect is so courageous, so you’re standing behind them. But you’re still not qualified to be a peacemaker. My Jiang Saint Clan has never been provoked like this before. If we don’t cripple them, where will we place the faces of the saint clans?” Jiang Tian slowly walked down the stairs.

“Then you can try and see who you can cripple today.” Lin Yun’s voice resounded as he slowly climbed the stairs.

“Junior Brother Lin!” Everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect turned around when they heard Lin Yun's voice, including Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan.
