Chapter 1344 - Fighting Qin Cang Again!

Lil’ Purple was exclaiming in excitement as she researched the stone tablet. Even Lin Yun’s curiosity was piqued by her words, but he knew that he could only hold it in for now. Right now, the Great Saint Origin was more important.

“Are the runes on it the Elysium Core Realm version of the Divine Sunchasing Art?” Lin Yun ultimately couldn’t help asking and couldn’t contain his composure. The one he was practicing now was the Ten Profound Steps, also called the Golden Crow Nine Transformation. It was the Heavenly Soul Realm version of the Divine Sunchasing Art.

If the Azure Dragon Lord hadn’t helped him manifest the pair of golden crow’s wings, the Golden Crow Nine Transformation would’ve long lost its effectiveness when he was at the Empyrean Realm. But his opponents were at the Elysium Core Realm now, and Qin Cang had an extremely powerful movement technique.

So if he couldn’t upgrade his movement technique, he would definitely suffer a loss when he fights Qin Cang, and he might even be suppressed by him. This was also the reason why everyone felt that he would be killed by Qin Cang. In a fight between two geniuses, the slightest fall could result in a complete loss.

“Hehe, not only the Elysium Core Realm version. I feel that it even has the Dragon Pulse Realm version, but that’s not the most important part about it!” Lil’ Purple said excitedly while she was in the sword box.

“Not the most important?”

“Didn’t I tell you about it before? This stone tablet is made from the bone of a golden crow, and there are restrictions on this bone. It might be a saint rune, divine rune, or even something even more precious!” Lil’ Purple couldn’t help sighing, “And here I was just saying that origin saint runes aren’t something you can just find anywhere.”

Lin Yun rejoiced when she said that. Even if he was a pretty composed person, he still couldn’t conceal his excitement.

“That baldie is really a fool, thinking that he had a huge bargain when he suffered a huge loss. You merely gave him the worst saint elixir and he ran so quickly. Hahaha! That baldie is really funny!” Lil’ Purple couldn’t help smiling when she mentioned Cang Yun. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“His mouth was really foul to say that you’ll be killed by Qin Cang. Lin Yun, you have to slap his face no matter what!”

“Didn’t you curse me earlier?”

“Hmph. I can say that, but he can’t! So you have to slap his face no matter what!” Lil’ Purple grumbled in the sword box, but Lin Yun merely ignored her.

“Junior Brother, what’s going on? That monk, Cang Yun, didn’t fool you, right?” Ye Ziling asked. She was still worried that Lin Yun was fooled by Cang Yun. After all, it was a saint elixir that they were talking about here.

“He didn’t,” replied Lin Yun. “This stone tablet has a huge connection with me, and it’s a huge opportunity. Even if I didn’t manage to obtain the Great Saint Origin, I'm confident that I can fight Qin Cang with this!”

When everyone saw Lin Yun speaking in such a confident tone, they no longer asked about it.

Far away, Luo Shuyi and Tang Jing were standing together, looking at Lin Yun’s party.

“Shuyi, why didn’t you chase after that baldie earlier? Nangong Ze and the others are chasing after him!” Tang Jing asked.

“There’s no need. The stone tablet is in Lin Yun’s hands now. Otherwise, there’s no way Lin Yun would let him go,” said Luo Shuyi.

“That stone tablet is the bone of a golden crow. Are we really going to give up on it…?” Tang Jing asked in a reluctant tone, but he soon stopped. He wanted to say that he didn’t want to benefit Lin Yun just like that. But seeing that Luo Shuyi was particularly concerned about Lin Yun, he immediately stopped.

“It doesn’t matter. He’s not an outsider, anyways.,” said Luo Shuyi.

Hearing that, Tang Jing couldn’t help feeling jealous, but he soon squeezed out a smile. “Shuyi, what should we do now?”

“Let’s go and take a look at what the Profound Sky Sect is planning. They’re too quiet, and this is too abnormal. We can’t stay here for long, and you can leave immediately if you can’t find any other opportunities. There’s no need for you to keep following me,” said Luo Shuyi before she soared to the sky. Her figure was graceful when she traveled, and Tang Jing briefly hesitated before he swiftly follwed her.

When Luo Shuyi turned around to look at him, Tang Jing quickly explained, “I have nothing to do anyways, so let me follow you. At least I can be of help if there is anything related to arrays.”

“Then, be careful,” said Luo Shuyi before she continued on her way. This made Tang Jing smile before he quickly followed her.

Four hours later, Lin Yun came to a black lake with the Profound Wither Key in his hand. He stopped and looked at the massive lake ahead of him. “This should be it.”

The lake was pitch black and was enveloped in a mist. This place was quiet and had no aura of the Great Saint Origin. This was a normal lake, and similar scenes could be seen everywhere in the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda. So there was nothing special about it.

“The Great Saint Origin is here,” said Lin Yun. His words caused Jiang Lichen and the rest who were looking at the lake to be shocked.

“The Great Saint Origin?” They were briefly stunned before they finally recovered from their shock. So the place that Lin Yun said he wanted to bring them to was where the Great Saint Origin was located.

“I-Is this real?” They practically couldn’t believe it because this lake looked too normal.

Su Ziyao looked at the lake before she said, “The Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda should have 108 mountains, but we can only see 107 mountains. If the Great Saint Origin is really here, then there should be a mountain here. It should be a hidden mountain!”

“Perhaps it’s at the heart of the lake!” Feng Zhang’s eyes flickered while he looked into the depths of the mist.

“No hurry. Look at what’s at the bottom of the lake,” said Lin Yun with a grave expression. When they looked at the bottom of the lake near the shore, they could see countless bones piled together. There were bones from demonic beasts, humans, and fresh human corpses that should belong to cultivators who carelessly intruded here.

Seeing the bones and corpses, Feng Zhang, Jiang Lichen, and the rest had fear in their eyes because this scene was a little scary. Jiang Lichen couldn’t help asking, “How did they die…?”

“Empress, can you see anything?” Lin Yun transmitted his voice to Lil’ Purple.

“I can’t see it too clearly, so I’d have to come out. But I can’t sense any arrays here, so the lake shouldn’t be poisonous. At most, there is only some baleful aura. If there aren’t any corpses, it will definitely feel great if I can take a bath in this lake.” Lil’ Purple was fond of yin. Yin was terrifying to others, but it was great nourishment to her. But since Su Ziyao was around, Lil’ Purple naturally wouldn’t dare to come out.

“Let me give it a try,” said Lin Yun. He sat down and circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art, igniting the three thousand dragon runes on his body. In the next second, Jiang Lichen and the rest could sense that Lin Yun’s vitality was like a bright sun, and this made them shocked. They now understood why Cang Yun was so happy when he got this body-refining technique.

Shortly after, a bizarre scene occurred. An azure dragon flew out from Lin Yun, flying towards the lake. This was a genuine dragon with blood and flesh, along with a torrential dragon aura.

Under everyone’s shocked eyes, the Azure Dragon dashed to the lake, and the surrounding space suddenly distorted. As the azure dragon disintegrated, the dragon runes returned to Lin Yun’s body, and this made Lin Yun throw out a mouthful of blood. The backlash also nearly left him unconscious.

He was already cautious, but he still suffered a backlash with his soul heavily injured. If his sword intent wasn’t strong enough, that attack alone would’ve been enough to destroy his soul.

“Lin Yun!” Su Ziyao’s face changed and quickly rushed over before injecting her astral energy into him.

A brief moment later, Lin Yun’s face became rosy once more. Opening his eyes, he gave Su Ziyao a smile before he got up on his feet. “I’m fine. I just can’t summon the azure dragon anytime soon.”

“Why did you throw out blood earlier?” Su Ziyao asked in a concerned tone.

Since Lin Yun’s injuries weren’t that serious, he smiled. “I finally know the secret here. This should be between two spatial rifts, and if we recklessly enter it, we’ll have to suffer the full force of the spatial vortex from the first and second layers. The spatial vortex is something that can even kill a Dragon Pulse Realm expert.”

“Does that mean that there’s no other way?” Everyone asked.

“Of course there is. We just have to make the mountain appear.” Lin Yun said confidently and took out the Profound Wither Key before injecting his firmament sword intent into it. When he poured his firmament sword intent into the Profound Wither Key, the lake was like a ferocious demonic beast that had been awakened, causing the surrounding space to tremble.

Not long later, a majestic mountain range rose up from the bottom of the lake, and the top of the mountain had a stone gate.

“That should be the entrance. The Great Saint Origin should be behind that stone gate, and this mountain can suppress the surrounding spatial fluctuation,” said Lin Yun. “It shouldn’t be a problem for us to head over now.”

But just when everyone became excited because they couldn’t believe that the Great Saint Origin was just ahead of them, a burst of laughter resounded just when they wanted to climb the mountain, “Flower Burial, you’ve not disappointed me.”

Shortly after, a figure enveloped in golden light appeared. He was emitting a terrifying pressure that caused waves to rise on the lake. It was Qin Cang, and his appearance made everyone’s faces change and become nervous.

Seeing Qin Cang also made Lin Yun’s eyes flash and he wondered if the Profound Sky Sect had been following him in the dark. But he soon noticed that Qin Cang was alone, and it looked like he came alone after finding his location. Otherwise, Qin Cang should’ve noticed his firmament sword intent a long time ago, and only Qin Cang could follow them without being noticed.

At this moment, Lin Yun knew that he was careless. But who could’ve thought that Qin Cang, ranked first on the Empyrean Ranking, would sneakily follow someone?

“You’re really careless to look for the Great Saint origin so openly. Did you think that no one would follow you?” Qin Cang smiled as he looked at Lin Yun with mockery in his eyes.

“You should worry about yourself instead. You’re not afraid of losing your life by coming here alone?” Ye Ziling replied.

But Qin Cang had no changes to his expression and replied, “Ants tend to think that they can kill an elephant by using numbers. Lin Yun, you’re barely out of the scope of ants, so you don’t have the same thoughts, right?”

When Ye Ziling saw that she was being ignored, she bit her lips because this was a bad feeling.

“Ziyao, bring them over and open the door. I’ll hold him back,” said Lin Yun calmly before handing the Profound Wither Key to Su Ziyao and taking a step forth to block Qin Cang.

“Alright,” said Su Ziyao after a brief hesitation.

“The Profound Wither Key!” Qin Cang’s eyes coldly flashed when he saw Lin Yun hand the key over and barked, “None of you can leave! Since you guys aren’t going to be obedient, then you guys can just die!”
