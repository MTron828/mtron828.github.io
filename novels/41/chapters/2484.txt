Chapter 2485 - I Said That I'll Kill You!

The stage was smashed, and the altar was destroyed. When the Empress left, the Deification Ceremony came to an end. This also meant that the conflict between Lin Yun and the Divine Dragon Empire had ended.

After the Empress lost, she didn’t head directly to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain because she still had words to inform Su Ziyao and let her take over the Profound Imperial Palace.

Seven days later, Su Ziyao became the Profound Imperial Palace’s palace master and controlled the Divine Dragon Empire. The Blade and Flame Emperors were to assist her under the Empress’ instruction before Su Ziyao reached the Emperor Realm.

With two mythical emperors helping her, everyone soon accepted the Empress’ inheritance, Su Ziyao’s position.

Lin Yun didn’t leave and stayed in the Profound Imperial Palace with Su Ziyao. Occasionally, he would host a gathering with Bai Lixuan, Mei Zihua, and Drifting Goblet. As for the remaining time, he spent it to temper his tenth-grade sword intent.

On this day in the Iris Secret Realm, Lin Yun sat mid-air beneath the Phoenix Tree, which gave off a dazzling sword ray, illuminating the entire secret realm. Not far away, Lil’ Purple followed Lin Yun’s instructions to craft lamps.

The lamps looked exquisite in Lil’ Purple’s hands, and saint runes were engraved on them. Inside the lamps was a jade slip, and the entire lamp was made with a branch of the Phoenix Tree. The jade slip was the martial technique that Lin Yun sorted out with some he created.

Even the Flowing Wind Sword was recreated by Lin Yun and reached the level of a dragon spirit martial technique. Aside from that, there was also the Dragon-Tiger Fist, Thunderclap Sword Art, and the Flicking Divine Finger. He even left behind the Nirvana Sword Art.

Opening his eyes, Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple and walked over with a smile. Caressing her head, Lin Yun smiled, “Thanks, Empress!”

“This is tough, and I’m more suitable to fight. Can you tell me why are you making these? You’ve been preparing them in the Skysolute City, and you even insisted on three thousand with saint runes and Phoenix Tree’s branch,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“Why don’t you make a guess?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmm...you must be intending to leave behind some inheritances before leaving the Kunlun Realm, including your comprehension in them,” Lil’ Purple replied.

“Smart! My current achievement is closely related to the opportunities I encountered. Now that my strength is beyond the Quasi-Deity Realm, I naturally have to leave behind some inheritance for Kunlun Realm,” Lin Yun said. Since Kunlun Realm helped him, he would help Kunlun Realm in return.

“Are the three thousand lamps done?” Lin Yun looked at the lamps on the ground.

“Yeah,” Lil’ Purple nodded.

As Lin Yun raised his hands, the three thousand lamps flew to the sky and covered the sky. But there wasn’t any cloth around the lamps and merely a structure. But Lin Yun already had an intention as three thousand cloths flew out with a thought.

“Condense!” With a flick of his finger, the three thousand cloths enveloped the structure of the lamps. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lil’ Purple’s face changed, and she was inwardly shocked. Lin Yun nurtured the three thousand cloths with vitality and sword intent but used them on the lamps. One must know that Lin Yun’s sword intent was in the tenth grade!

“It’s finally perfect now!” Lin Yun nodded. He smiled, “If anyone can obtain the lamp, the sword intent on the cloths could protect their lives.”

Even an Emperor wouldn’t be able to harm anyone protected by the cloths, or they would be heavily injured instead.

“Go!” With a wave of his hand, the lamps hung themselves on the Phoenix Tree, nurtured by the entire Iris Secret Realm.

“You’re generous. Since that’s the case, I won’t be stingy,” Lil’ Purple said and breathed out, infusing her phoenix saint origin into the lamps.

“When do you plan to leave?” Lil’ Purple turned to look at Lin Yun, whose smile slowly disappeared.

Lin Yun could leave but couldn’t bear to part with Su Ziyao, so he delayed. After pondering briefly, he said, “I want to see what Ziyao thinks of the Heavenly Fate Talisman.”

If Su Ziyao accepts the Heavenly Fate Talisman, she will be responsible for protecting the Kunlun Realm. Before she handed over her position, she couldn’t leave the Kunlun Realm.

“She won’t refuse it,” Lil’ Purple said. “She must have an agreement with the Empress.”

Lin Yun said nothing because he had to leave Kunlun Realm no matter what to cultivate and find Yue Weiwei. He also wanted to visit the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity. But it looks like Su Ziyao wouldn’t be able to leave with her, and one of them had to remain in Kunlun Realm.

“One of us will have to stay behind,” Su Ziyao said, which Lin Yun wasn’t surprised. But Lin Yun said nothing and handed her the Heavenly Fate Talisman.

“If you go to the God Burial Mountain Range, the first person you meet might not be the Demonspirit Clan but Wang Muyan,” Su Ziyao said, explaining what she saw in the God Burial Mountain Range back then as she received the Heavenly Fate Talisman.

Su Ziyao went on to share her speculation, “Wang Muyan might be a divine maiden, but she’s a container for the rebirth of the Blood Monarch. I might’ve stopped the ceremony and injured Wang Muyan, but she must’ve recovered. Once the Blood Monarch is familiar with Wang Muyan’s body, he will regain his strength as a Quasi-Deity.”

The Blood Monarch had already reached the Deity Realm three thousand years ago. He might’ve used an alternate method, but that wouldn’t change the fact that he was a Deity.

Lin Yun finally understood why Wang Muyan talked so much in the last meeting.

“Last night, Senior Radiant and the Black and White Emperors discussed with me. We will join forces to wipe out the Blood Moon Sect, not demonic cultivators or demonic beasts’ forces. Your master will personally kill the one who previously caused havoc in the Heavenly Dao Sect,” Su Ziyao said, sharing their plans to gather all forces and focus on wiping out the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan.

Lin Yun pondered and knew that someone had to stay behind for this matter.

“But that’s on the prerequisite that you can resolve the God Burial Mountain Range, or everything will go down the drain,” Su Ziyao continued.

Lin Yun nodded and said, “Have you found the person I told you to look for?”

“He hid himself deeply, but we found him,” Su Ziyao said after a brief stun.

Lin Yun said nothing and spent the last night with the Iris Sword Box before leaving the Profound Imperial Palace. When he left the Profound Imperial Palace, he went to look for An Liuyan, who had become the lord of the Demon Gate.

Previously, those Emperor Realm elders were worried that he might interfere with the Demon Gate’s affairs because of his relationship with An Liuyan, forcing An Liuyan to promise them that she would sever her ties with him.

Lin Yun didn’t care about that previously, and he naturally wouldn’t take it to heart now that he had become invincible in Kunlun Realm. When he arrived in the Demon Gate, the four Emperor Realm elders came out to welcome him, looking nervous.

“I greet the young master!” Unlike others, An Liuyan was excited and didn’t dominate the Demon Gate’s leader. This changed the faces of the four Emperor Realm’s elders, but they didn’t dare to say a word.

“I have private matters to discuss with your sect master. Leave and remember to close the door.” Lin Yun carried An Liuyan and walked towards the throne in the hall.

The faces of the four Emperor Realm elders changed, and they instantly guessed what Lin Yun wanted to do. An Emperor Realm elder said, “Flower Burial, that’s the throne of my Demon Gate, forged by the Heartless Demon Emperor.”

“So what?” Lin Yun waved his hand without even turning back.

The Emperor Realm elder who spoke out was sent flying away, throwing out blood with his face becoming pale. This made the faces of the other three Emperors change and dare not stay here for another moment.

With that, Lin Yun and An Liuyan were left in the hall. After they were done with their affairs, An Liuyan lay in Lin Yun’s embrace.

“They mean no malice,” An Liuyan said.

“I know, but they still have to be taught a lesson. Otherwise, they might force you to do what you dislike in the future. They’re in no position to interfere in the affairs of my woman,” Lin Yun replied.

An Liuyan’s face became rosy, and she smiled, “Young Master, are you heading to the God Burial Mountain Range?”

Lin Yun nodded in acknowledgment upon hearing that.

“Wait for a little longer.” An Liuyan hugged Lin Yun’s neck and turned around, pressing him down on the throne.

When Lin Yun left the Demon Gate, there was a hint of exhaustion on his face.

“Scumbag!” When Lin Yun carried the Iris Sword Box, Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded.

Lin Yun merely smiled and said nothing. Two days later, he appeared before a shop in a flourishing city of the Divine Dragon Empire. This street was bustling with people, and this shop was insignificant.

“Boss, two buns.”

“Here you go.” The boss smiled and took out two buns.

When Lin Yun received the buns, he removed his hood and raised his head with a smile, “Jin Jue, do you still remember me?”

This old man, the Profound Sky Sect’s Jin Jue, made things difficult for him in the Heavenly Path and nearly killed him.

Jin Jue was frightened and fell to his knees upon seeing Lin Yun. He had a high profile in the first few years he came to the Divine Dragon Empire, but as Lin Yun’s fame rose, he became so terrified that he went into hiding.

Thus, Jin Jue concealed his identity to live as an ordinary person. It had been so long that he thought Lin Yun had forgotten him. But he didn’t expect Lin Yun to remember him even after becoming an existence comparable to Quasi-Deities.

“Flower Burial, please spare my life...I am nothing compared to you now. So, why do you have to dirty your hands?” Jin Jue went on his knees to beg for mercy.

“Since I said in the past that I will kill you, it means that I will kill you!” Lin Yun reduced Jin Jue into minced meat with his palm. This relieved him, and he could feel the karma tying him down was lifted.
