Chapter 2099: Hot-Headed (2)

There was only half a month left, but Wang Muyan refused to believe that Ye Qingtian could turn the tables around. She turned into a streak and chased after him.

The sky outside the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was yellow as the sun set and the red sunlight cast a red layer on the ground. When night arrived, the remaining gleam of sunlight was like crimson paint on the world. The ground was dyed red, and the sky was dyed crimson.

“This is the afterglow and the last pride of the sun. Even when darkness soon descends, it will still envelop the world in red.” Lin Yun muttered to himself. Even the sun had multiple changes around the day, from sunrise to sunset.

But is that the case? It may have never changed.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts as he looked into the distance. He had a rough direction in his mind and was waiting for the moon to appear.

When the moon appeared, Wang Muyan stepped into the moonlight when she arrived. The moonlight was like a layer of charm on her, like an azure lotus. This was a great contrast to her usual temperament.

Wang Muyan looked at Lin Yun, and asked, “It’s really hard to find you. Do you already have a direction in your heart?”

Lin Yun responded with a nod.

“I heard that you’ve ripped the notes apart. Are you that confident in yourself? I don’t think you’ve even started yet. Don’t tell me that you’ve yet to grasp the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal, right? I’m worried about you.” Wang Muyan’s voice was crisp and ethereal, as if it came from beyond this world.

“How many variations have you grasped?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Two.” Wang Muyan continued, “According to the current progress, you can’t win. You’ve yet to grasp the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal. On the other hand, I have already grasped two variations.”

“It looks like you came prepared,” Lin Yun replied.

“Since that’s the case, why don’t you come and help me undo the Nether Shackles?” Wang Muyan smiled.

“There’s no need to hurry. It’s still too early to talk about winning. If you don’t mind, we can comprehend together,” Lin Yun said calmly.

“Okay!” Wang Muyan felt that ye Qingtian was challenging her, which provoked her desire to win. She wanted to see how Ye Qingtian would turn the tables around but was disappointed because he began practicing his sword techniques.

Lin Yun was practicing the Divine Firefly Sword as the sun rose and set. His sword technique was mysterious and even Wang Muyan failed to recognize that it was the Divine Firefly Sword. In the beginning, Wang Muyan managed to see some clues and could recognize which sword form it was. But seven days later, she could no longer recognize the Divine Firefly Sword that Ye Qingtian was practicing.

Lin Yun’s Divine Firefly Sword had broken through the restraints of moves and was like flowing water. Countless flows of water followed Lin Yun’s sword, and his sword was like a flowing river.

His sword ray was crystal clear and shining brightly under the rising sun, and it would disappear without a trace at night.

Lin Yun’s sword technique became unfathomable as the sun and moon alternated. If one looked afar, the sky looked like if it was filled with sword rays, and there were countless afterimages beneath the sword rays.

This shocked Wang Muyan. She had to admit that Ye Qingtian was a genius. His sword technique was profound, and she couldn’t even follow the trajectory. It was as though the Divine Firefly Sword had disappeared from his hands.

The thirteen sword techniques were only left with flowing water with no beginning or end. When Wang Muyan imagined herself as Ye Qingtian’s enemy, she couldn’t help feeling a chill run down her spine. But what did it have to do with the Divine Solar Lunar Art?

“Let’s see what you’re trying to do then. I don’t believe you can win the bet,” Wang Muyan gritted.

With that, a month had passed in the blink of an eye. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Let’s start with forming the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal.” The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord found the two of them to see their results.

Wang Muyan looked confident as she formed seals with golden sunlight and silver moonlight shining on her. When a dragon’s roar echoed, the surroundings changed as the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal was formed, with a dragon coiling around her hands with the sun and moon overlapping.

This brought a smile to Wang Muyan’s face as she turned to look at Ye Qingtian. Ye Qingtian spent half a month in seclusion and the other half of the month practicing his sword. She didn’t see him practicing the Divine Solar Lunar Art.

But when she turned her head, her mouth was wide open with disbelief reflected in her eyes. This was because Lin Yun had also formed the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal.

“Holy Maiden, you seem surprised?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Junio Brother Ye is truly a genius. But there are still the variations next, so I wonder how far you have comprehended?” Wang Muyan smiled. The nine variations of the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal were nine levels, and the difficulty would gradually increase along the way. Thus, she was confident about winning the bet.

“Not bad, I guess?” Lin Yun and Wang Muyan removed a white jade slip and placed it against their forehead. Once they have injected their comprehension into the jade slips, they would hand them to the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord to determine who won the bet.

An hour later, the two gave their jade slips to the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord. They didn’t know what each other had recorded in their jade slips, but they looked confident in their comprehension.

After the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord went through the two jade slips, he had shock and surprise on his face.

Wang Muyan said, “Please announce the results. I’m determined to win this bet.”

“Don’t be so certain about that!” Lin Yun smiled.

The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord regained his composure and looked at Wang Muyan, “As expected of the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden. Not only did you grasp the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal, but you even came up with three variations. I’m impressed.”

Wang Muyan wore a bright smile when she heard that, and she turned to look at Lin Yun. She played a trick on him. She had already grasped two variations and came up with the third variation later. But she lied to him that she had only grasped two variations.

Lin Yun was surprised and turned to look at Wang Muyan, who wore a smug look on her face.

“Ye Qingtian is also impressive. As expected of a genius in the past and the next five hundred years. You’ve completed three variations,” the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord smiled. “This is a pleasant surprise today. I initially prepared one Phoenix Blood Sword Soul, but I have to apply for another one now.”

“No way! We need a distinction between us!” Wang Muyan said anxiously.

The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord was surprised before he said, “There’s no need for that. Both of you have grasped different variations, so you two can receive a Phoenix Blood Sword Soul each. There’s no need to determine who won.”

“We must determine a victor no matter what,” Wang Muyan said, red-faced.

“Look, she’s becoming anxious!” Lil’ Purple gloated within the Iris Secret Realm.

This placed the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord in a difficult position because Ye Qingtian and Wang Muyan were geniuses of the Heavenly Dao Sect, and he wasn’t in the position to take either side.

“Saint Lord, you can leave the Phoenix Blood Sword Soul behind. I’ll resolve this matter,” Lin Yun smiled.

The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord heaved a sigh of relief and nodded in Ye Qingtian’s direction. He took out the box containing the Phoenix Blood Sword Soul and left. This was a matter between two youngsters, so it was best for them to resolve it amongst themselves. As for an old man like him, it was best for him not to be involved.

What Ye Qingtian said was right, it was easy for youngsters to become hot-headed!
