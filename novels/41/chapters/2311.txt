Chapter 2312 - Heavenly Barren Realm

“Blue Dragon King Xiao Chen…” Lin Yun muttered, “Why does this name sound a little familiar?”

“This isn’t a unique name but a common one. But it’s unique because it comes with the title of Blue Dragon King or Ancestral Deity,” the holy master explained.

Lin Yun smiled but said nothing. However, his thoughts began to wander. It turned out that the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity’s name was Xiao Chen. He might not have seen the Blue Dragon King, but he had a feeling that the person he saw back in the Hidden Sword Manor was Blue Dragon King Xiao Chen.

That meant the ‘broken sword’ within his body must be related to this person and his appearance in the Kunlun Realm because that mysterious sword ray wasn’t a coincidence. Lin Yun had guessed it all because his current achievement was related to the Iris Sword Box from the Profound Amber Realm, while the Iris Sword Saint was the successor of the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity.

All of the mysteries urged Lin Yun to meet the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity. He looked at the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign and asked, “What is the Nether Realm, and what is the Divine Fate Palace?”

“There’s no Nether Realm but the underworld. Everyone will go there when they die, and this includes a deity. Even the underworld cannot escape nirvana. The Divine Fate Palace suppresses the underworld to prevent anyone from altering nirvana. No one escaped fate and could resist the Divine Fate Palace. There has been a rumour that the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity wanted to resist fate for one person and prepared a trump card for the Kunlun Realm,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign explained. He continued, “No one knows the exact story since it is only a speculation. But it wasn’t a secret in the Dragon’s Gate that the Ancestral Deity had a close friend.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thought. It looked like the Sacred Alliance didn’t know much either, since they were only speculations. He soon diverted the topic back to the Heavenly Path and asked, “One question. Why can’t the Heavenly Path be reforged even after so many years?”

He was curious because the Kunlun Realm must have given birth to many experts throughout the years. Since the Azure Dragon Lord could sever the Heavenly Path, someone should have been capable of reforging it.

“That’s the key,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign sighed. “It’s hard and dangerous to reforge it. Over the years, the number of people with this ability wouldn’t exceed the fingers on two hands. Let’s speak about the most recent one, the Southern Emperor. He was at the pinnacle of the Emperor Realm who could even suppress deities, and he could reforge the Heavenly Path with his strength.”

Lin Yun was calm while hearing this since he highly valued the Southern Emperor’s strength. If the Southern Emperor couldn’t reforge the Heavenly Path, no one else could have any hope of doing it. He asked, “Did the Southern Emperor give up after his wife died?”

He knew of the Southern Emperor’s love story, and that the Flower Burial Sword was the token of love between the two. But the Southern Emperor was focused on reviving his wife after that before he died with his heart shattered.

“That’s not the case,” the holy master denied that speculation. He asked, “Lin Yun, you’ve been to the God Burial Mountain Range. Do you know the situation within the Heavenly Void?”

“I have been there before,” Lin Yun replied.”The Heavenly Void is complicated, and the Demonspirit Clan is terrifying. They have been accumulating their strength, and there is more than one Heavenly Void in the God Burial Mountain Range. So I can’t imagine the amount of demonic corpses in their possession.”

The holy master nodded and said, “Those are what you can see, but you don’t know the true terror of it.”

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun asked.

“Deities!” The holy master said, “Deities can’t be killed by those who aren’t in the Deity Realm. Even if you defeat them, you can’t kill them completely. Many deities weren’t truly killed in that battle but were suppressed in the God Burial Mountain Range. So if the Heavenly Path is reforged…”

“Those deities will break out from their seal?” Lin Yun asked with his face changing.

“Not only that. If the Heavenly Path isn’t around, the deities will be greatly restricted, even if they can break free from the seal and can’t recover their full strength,” the holy master said. “But the moment the Heavenly Path is reforged, the restriction on Emperor Realm would disappear, and new deities would appear. The suppressed deities will then recover to their full strength.”

Lin Yun finally knew where the problem lay. If they wanted to reforge the Heavenly Path, they would also have to deal with those deities who were suppressed beneath the God Burial Mountain Range.

“Those deities are now weak because they’re sealed. But if they recover to their full strength, the Kunlun Realm would end,” the holy master continued. “There are five places like the God Burial Mountain Range.”

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign looked at Lin Yun with shining eyes, and said, “But it’s different now. You remember that the Iris Sword Saint slew deities while he was at the Saint Realm, right?”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned and soon came to his senses, throwing out the tea he had just drank in his mouth. He bitterly smiled, “You want me to slay them? I might have some odds against Saint Sovereigns, and I can even kill a Great Saint, but the Emperor Realm is beyond my ability.”

“You can’t now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t in the future. You can try it after becoming a Great saint,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign said. “Most importantly, you’ve grasped Nirvana Dao.”

Lin Yun instantly understood everything. He said, “I won’t refuse it if I can accomplish that. Not only me, but my master and big brother also hope that I can reforge the Heavenly Path. But I have a request. Can the two of you help out when my master undergoes his tribulation?”

Lin Yun’s gaze ultimately fell onto the holy master.

The holy master smiled, “Of course, I can. But before that, I have something that I would like you to help out with. If you agree, I will do my best to stop Tian Xuanzi, even at the cost of my life. Aside from that, I can also give you the Sinful Fire Divine Rune. As for the other Sovereign Divine Runes, I can provide you with clues and help you snatch them if you want.”

“Snatching doesn’t seem like a good idea,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Borrow them, then,” the holy master smiled.

Lin Yun was stunned before he figured that they meant the same thing. Most importantly, the terms given by the holy master were too good. Not only would he help out with the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation, but he would also give him the Sinful Fire Divine Rune.

He couldn’t imagine what the holy master wanted him to do. He lowered his cup and suppressed his emotions. He calmly asked, “Holy Master, you can tell me what you need me to do first.”

“There’s a Heavenly Barren Realm outside the Kunlun Realm, and no one knows the origin of this realm. When everyone knew about it, the Heavenly Barren Realm was already under the control of the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity,” the holy master said. “That’s a land of fortune, and the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity would open the Heavenly Barren Realm once every thousand years. You can find countless treasures there or divine elixirs. Each era’s pinnacle forces would send their geniuses over there to train, and you can rapidly increase your strength. The outstanding ones would even be taken in as the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity’s disciple, possessing a chance of reaching the Deity Realm!”

“What’s that place? Why have I not heard it before?” Lin Yun was surprised.

“After the Heavenly Path was severed, reaching the Heavenly Barren Realm became hard. It requires a divine flame to activate an ancient teleportation array. Aside from that, you’ll also need a token,” the holy master said. “Because the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity once helped the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity, anyone can participate as long as they possess the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity’s Lesser Blue Dragon Medal. But the divine flame and Lesser Blue Dragon Medals are rare since most have been exhausted over the past hundred thousand years. The number of Lesser Blue Dragon Medals now wouldn’t exceed the number of five.”

Lin Yun instantly knew why the Divine Phoenix Mountain wanted the divine flame fragment. Divine Phoenix Mountain must have a similar teleportation array and also possess the Lesser Blue Dragon Medal. So, they only needed the divine flame fragment.

“The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity isn’t only an expert in the Ancestral Realm, but also the controller of the Heavenly Gate, one of the oldest forces in the universe.”

“How great is his strength?”

“He can be evenly matched with the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity back then, but he probably became even more unfathomable now and we can’t imagine it.”

Lin Yun suddenly thought of something because Ji Zixi would head to the Heavenly Barren Realm, but what had it got to do with him? He asked, “Holy Master, you want me to go to the Heavenly Barren Realm?”

The holy master nodded at Lin Yun’s words.

“But it’s not easy to obtain the Lesser Blue Dragon Medal or divine flame fragment, right?” Lin Yun asked.

“This is why I invited the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign over,” the holy master smiled, “I’m sure there’s a Lesser Blue Dragon Medal in the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain and Sacred Alliance.”

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign nodded, “I have observed you for days, and the holy master has convinced me. As for the divine flame fragment, one is enough for two people to transport over.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thought but said nothing. Heading to the Heavenly Barren Realm would be risky and beneficial at the same time, but it would be very dangerous or the holy master wouldn’t make such a huge sacrifice.

It was only opened once every thousand years, and there must have been people who went there before. But there wasn't any news back, which meant that they probably died there. Even if they were alive, they might not be able to return to the Kunlun Realm.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Lin Yun asked, “Will we be able to return if we can’t become that Ancestral Deity’s disciple?”
