Chapter 944 - Strong Stance!

When Lin Yun removed his hood, Mo Yan, Mu Ziyi, and Wu Mu instantly recognized him. After all, there wasn’t a single person in the Azure Dragon Region who hadn’t heard of Lin Yun’s name. He was like a rising comet to rise brightly, especially after he killed Kong Xuan.

Aside from the seven heads from the Azure Dragon Ranking, Lin Yun shone the brightest in the Azure Dragon Region now. Mo Yan’s face also changed when he looked at Lin Yun because he knew that Lin Yun wouldn’t be a nobody since he could kill the two elites from his Blazeyang Realm easily. But he never expected that he would actually be facing Lin Yun.

“Flower Burial, you truly deserve your reputation,” said Mo Yan after a brief hesitation. “But…I was the one to discover this Gold-furred Demonic Ape, and we’ve spent a great deal of effort killing you. Aren’t you a little too unreasonable to rob it from us?”

When Lin Yun heard what he said on the sword box, he suddenly smiled. This was still the first time someone from the higher realm tried to reason with him. One must know that in the past, the higher realms viewed others like ants and many lower realms’ geniuses were killed in the Flamefeather City.

Lin Yun already knew that these people were arrogant but would bow when they encountered someone strong. Furthermore, they would treat their opponent differently if they were also from the higher realm. As for those from the lower realms, they wouldn’t even bat an eye to kill them.

“How surprising,” sneered Lin Yun. He didn’t bother concealing his mockery. If they were from the intermediate realm, Lin Yun might not interfere as long as they didn’t take it too far. But since they were from the higher realms, then he had no burden making a move.

As for reasoning? Back then, Feng Wuji didn’t reason with him trying to kill him, nor did the Bloodbone Realm. No one wanted to reason with him when his fame wasn’t resounding and treated him like an ant. Not that his fame had spread throughout the Azure Dragon Realm, did those people want to reason with him? Lin Yun could only sneer in his heart towards that.

The Heavenly Path was where the strong prey on the weak. When Lin Yun was weak, he also didn’t ask his opponent to reason with him and relied on his sword to open a path forcibly.

Looking at the mockery on Lin Yun’s face, Mo Yan, Mu Ziyi, and Wu Mu’s faces had changed because they knew that they couldn’t reason about this matter today. Suddenly, the atmosphere became cold and tense with their aura clashing together.

“Don’t push it. You think we’re afraid of a clown from the lower realm like you?” Mo Yan finally became enraged. “Since you’re courting death, then I’ll fulfil your wish. Anyhow, your head is pretty valuable nowadays. Let’s go!”

Mo Yan, Mu Ziyi, and Wu Mu were all experienced and had been accumulating their strength when they talked. Mu Ziyi sneered, “Flower Burial? I’m curious how much strength you can bring out under my array…”

Lin Yun’s fame might be resounding, but they could even kill the Gold-furred Demonic Ape if they joined forces together. So how would they be afraid of Lin Yun? Since they couldn’t resolve this with words, then they could just kill him.

What Mo Yan said was true because Lin Yun’s head was extremely valuable. Not to mention the bounty from Bloodbone Realm, just the Glorysun Spirit and his greater dao artifact alone were priceless.

When his eyes flashed with greed and before he could even make his move, a black figure suddenly appeared with a cold flash piercing into his body which made his hair stand because he could feel the terrifying threat. But even in danger, Mu Ziyi was calm and started condensing spiritual runes before him.

But when the black figure took out a dagger, the dagger easily tore apart the spiritual diagram he was forming. By the time Mu Ziyi retreated, he was shocked to discover a tear on his clothes. He was fortunate that he was wearing a defensive dao artifact or that attack alone would take half of his life.

When Mu Ziyi raised his head, he saw that his opponent was actually a black cat. This instantly made him enraged, “You bastard!”

“Hehe.” Lil’ Red chuckled and kept the Void Blade before retrieving the Blood Viperwhip. Before Mu Ziyi could even attack, Lil’ Red had already lashed out the whip towards his opponent. This caught Mu Ziyi completely by surprise as he panicked and rolled on the ground to avoid this attack.

Not bad. Lin Yun finally relaxed when he saw the fight between Lil’ Red and Mu Ziyi. As long as Lil’ Red could keep Mu Ziyi busy, the three of them won’t be able to work together and they would be of no concern. As for the other elites, they were nothing before his eyes despite their numbers. If they dared to interfere in the fight, then the two elites who were killed earlier would be their outcome.

This sudden turn of events had clearly disrupted Mo Yan’s rhythm as he looked at Mu Ziyi furiously because this fellow only knew how to boast. Earlier when they faced the Gold-furred Demonic Ape, they nearly failed because of him. And now, he was actually held up by a pet which was simply a humiliation to the higher realms.

On the other hand, Wu Mu didn’t even hesitate to charge towards Lin Yun, activating his bloodline and dashed over like a small hill. When he threw his punch out, it had created a sonic boom before his attack even landed with an immense pressure blowing out that made Lin Yun’s clothes flutter in the wind.

“Great!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed and threw the hood away. The hood was torn apart by Wu Mu’s punch before his fist arrived before Lin Yun. His punch was like the claw of a ferocious beast that tore through space and headed towards Lin Yun’s head.

Thinking about how Wu Mu shattered the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s head with his dao artifact earlier, one could imagine the aftermath if his punch landed on Lin Yun’s head. But when his punch was two inches away from Lin Yun, his movements became slow as if he had fallen into a quagmire because of Lin Yu’s sword intent.

When the sword intent around Lin Yun exploded, he clenched his fist and faced Wu Mu’s punch head-on. When the two punches collided, the boundless sword aura around Lin Yun manifested into an azure dragon which instantly tore Wu Mu’s aura apart.

In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun and Wu Mu had exchanged over ten-odd punches but Lin Yun didn’t even budge no matter how Wu Mu attacked.

“Die!” Mo Yan was briefly stunned before he joined the battle with blazing flames poured over. The aura around Mo Yan was like an ocean of flames with his punch unleashing torrential flames which lit up the entire Ashes Valley. One had to admit that Lin Yun’s second-grade flame intent was truly impressive.

But Lin Yun stomped his foot on the sword box before he executed the Cloudsoaring Art and dodged Mo Yan’s attack.

“You think you can escape?” Mo Yan sneered. He didn’t believe that Lin Yun could survive with them joining hands together. But just when he wanted to chase up to Lin Yun, Lin Yun waved his hand and the sword box rose from the ground and stood before his path.

Mo Yan’s terrifying fist created a huge explosion when it clashed against the sword box which echoed throughout the valley. The weight of the Iris Sword Box had far exceeded Mo Yan’s expectation and the rebound force made Mo Yan groan out.

In the sky, Lin Yun turned around and waved his hand with his eyes flashing sharply, “Sword!”

The sword box blocking Mo Yan’s path suddenly opened with countless petals flying out. By the time Lin Yun clenched his hand, he had grabbed onto a scabbard with his left hand and a sword hilt with his right.

As the sword streaked, Lin Yun’s hair started to flutter in the wind as sword rays intertwined together because Lin Yun was using the second form of the Three Heavenly Rends, Azure Lotus!

Before Wu Mu who charged over could respond, he was sent flying back with a slash and his defensive dao artifact that even withstood the attacks from the Gold-furred Demonic Ape shattered into pieces.

This made Wu Mu throw out a mouthful of blood as he fell onto the ground with one knee. The ancient runes were revealed on his body when the defensive dao artifact shattered. Half of the crimson light on the runes had already dissipated.

“Let me take the dao artifact and I’ll leave,” said Wu Mu when he looked at Lin Yun. When Mo Yan heard that, his face changed drastically before he flew into a rage. After all, Wu Mu had taken a hundred of his divine astral pellets.

Lin Yun sheathed his sword before he plunged Flower Burial onto the ground and waved his hand. The iron staff plunged into the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s skull then started to tremble violently before it flew into Lin Yun’s hand. When Lin Yun held onto the iron staff, he was shocked by the immense weight. But he didn’t even hesitate to throw it towards Wu Mu.

Lin Yun was naturally willing to see Wu Mu leave. After all, it would be troublesome even for him to face Wu Mu and Mo Yan at the same time.

After Wu Mu received the iron staff, he glanced at the Gold-furred Demonic Ape before turning to Lin Yun again, “I don’t need the beast core. Let me have the corpse and I’ll help you deal with Mo Yan.”

This time, Mo Yan finally couldn’t hold it back anymore and roared, “Wu Mu, don’t take it too far! You took a hundred divine astral pellets from me. But now, you want to gang up against me with this trash from the lower realm?!”

With a calm expression, Wu Mu replied, “I’ve fulfilled the side of my bargain by killing the Gold-furred Demonic Ape. As for the lower realm? It has nothing to do with me. The Demonic Constellation Realm only respects the strong.”

Mo Yan was angered to the point that his body started to tremble. Just a moment ago, the three of them were still ganging up on Lin Yun. But now, he was all alone by himself. Not to mention that Wu Mu even wanted to betray him and go to his enemy’s side. So how could he accept this?

“Tempting suggestion, but I don’t need your help,” smiled Lin Yun before he turned to look at Mo Yan with a playful smile.

“What arrogance! I alone am enough to kill you! Great Sunblazing Heaven!” Mo Yan snorted with his killing intent exploding. Pushing his second-grade flame intent to the limit, he then executed the overlord fortune martial technique with a golden brilliance exploding from his body. He had used the attack that he used earlier to take the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s life once more.

The power of this strike had reached a terrifying height as it was Mo Yan’s strongest attack.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Divine Sunbreaking Seal!” Lin Yun had no change on his face as the giant winged human appeared behind him with a bright sun exploding in its hand before facing Mo Yan’s attack head-on. This was a collision between two ‘suns’.
