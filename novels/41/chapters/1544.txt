Chapter 1545 - Sword Basking In The Blood Of Saint (1)

Qin Xiao’s face sank when Mu Xuankong wielded his sword. At this moment, he was finally sure that Mu Xuankong had come to kill, and he didn’t mind waging war with the Nether Divinity Clan. But this was something that made him feel that this was unbelievable.

This made no sense at all. Lin Yun wasn’t dead, and the Nether Divinity Clan wasn’t weak, either. Not to mention that the Sword Sect had long declined. There weren’t any benefits for the Sword Sect to offend a saint clan. So what gives?

“Mu Xuankong, you want to kill me over one Lin Yun?” Qin Xiao questioned, and a painting unfolded behind him as his constellation opened up. This was a bronze mountain, and the top of the bronze mountain had a black palace radiating brightly.

Around the constellation, countless laws were rippling out in space. After Qin Xiao summoned his constellation, Qin Xiao’s saint aura exploded, blocking the boundless aura that Mu Xuankong was releasing.

“What else? Do you want me to suck it up? Do you want me to compromise so that you can keep testing my bottom line? Since I, Mu Xuankong, made my decision, I won’t change my mind!” Mu Xuankong had no intention of compromising with Qin Xiao, who became a saint long before him.

“Don’t forget that your cultivation is lower than mine!” Qin Xiao said coldly while looking at Mu Xuankong. He pointed with his finger, unleashing a black fireball that was filled with a terrifying chill as it shot towards Mu Xuankong.

This might seem like a simple finger, but it was a dragon spirit martial technique of the Nether Divinity Clan, the Flaming Dragon Finger. Only those who reached the Samsara Edict Realm could exhibit a terrifying power. In the hands of saints, it possessed a terrifying destructive might.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

But facing Qin Xiao, Mu Xuankong drew his sword by half an inch, unleashing a terrifying sword ray that shone brightly. The radiance lit up the entire Nether Divinity Clan and half the northwest of the Ancient Barren Domain.

Within a hundred-mile radius, it was brightly lit like the day. When the black flaming dragon flew towards Mu Xuankong, it was shattered by the sword ray.

“Qin Xiao, it has been eight hundred years since you became a saint. Is that all you got?” Mu Xuankong raised his eyebrow with contempt flashing across his pupils. He was looking down on Qin Xiao as the sect master of the Sword Sect.

Qin Xiao’s face changed as he waved his hand, and the black palace within his constellation rose into the sky. In the next second, countless starlights and runes gathered on the black palace, making the black palace seem even more terrifying. As the entire world turned dark, the blazing sun behind Mu Xuankong was gradually being devoured by the darkness.

“The Nether Divinity Palace… It has been a hundred years since it last appeared. Is a saint battle going to take place?” The saints from the northwest of the Ancient Barren Domain all looked in the Nether Divinity Clan’s direction with shock on their faces.

Although all the sects have been competing fiercely within the Ancient Barren Domain, a saint battle had never occurred before, especially since the Profound Sky Sect and Sword Sect were like fire and water.

Unless it concerned the survivability of their sect, the saints of the various sects wouldn’t make a move, and it had already become a rapport between the sects. This was because becoming a saint wasn’t easy, and no saint would want to risk their life by dying. But today, a saint battle took place.

“Scarlet Firmament!” Mu Xuankong said, and the longsword in his hand manifested into a blazing golden light that tore apart the darkness and collided with the black palace.

The collision was piercing, making everyone’s eardrums hurt, and they became deaf. This instantly enveloped everyone in fear because this was a battle between two saints, and this wasn’t a battle that they could watch.

Everyone from the Nether Divinity Clan immediately fled, wanting to leave this region. Some Dragon Pulse Realm experts had quietly fled when they saw Mu Xuankong.

The collision echoed loudly, sounding as though stars were about to collapse. As the black palace shattered into countless fragments, the fragments looked like black fireballs that fell onto the ground.

If they allowed the black palace’s fragments to fall, it would definitely destroy the thousand years of roots of the Nether Divinity Clan, not to mention that the one who made a move was the sect master of the Sword Sect.

“How is this possible?!” Qin Xiao was shocked. That black palace was called the Nether Divinity Palace, and it wasn’t easy to refine it. But it was nothing before Mu Xuankong. It was destroyed with one sword.

“Mu Xuankong, you’re courting death!” Qin Xiao finally lost it. He took out a longspear, a rare Glory Saint Artifact with gloryfire and gloryice spirits engraved on it.

This spear had three thousand five hundred stars engraved on it. This thousand-star Glory Saint Artifact was called the Divine Radiant Spear. This was the treasure of the Nether Divinity Clan, and only the patriarch could wield it. If it were pushed to the limit, it would possess the might of shattering space.

But it wasn’t easy to push it to the limit. When the spear appeared in Qin Xiao’s hand, he charged toward Mu Xuankong without any hesitation. Simultaneously, a black membrane appeared from the Nether Divinity Clan below, blocking the Nether Divinity Palace’s fragments. No matter how ferociously the fragments fell, they couldn’t break through the membrane.

“The Nether Divinity Skysealing Array!” Everyone exclaimed. This was also why the Nether Divinity Clan was the leader of all the saint clans within the Ancient Barren Domain.

When the Nether Divinity Skysealing Array was activated, two powerful auras soared out from the black membrane. They were two elders, emitting terrifying saint auras that were even stronger than Qin Xiao’s.

“Three saints!”

“A saint clan actually has three saint clans?! It looks like this Nether Divinity Clan isn’t simple!”

“If you include the saints guarding the war realm, this means that the Nether Divinity Clan’s number of saints has reached a terrifying number of five!”

The two figures were the ancestors of the Qin Saint Clan, who were over two thousand years old. This meant that they didn’t have much lifespan left, and they were usually in seclusion, trying to make a breakthrough and practically wouldn’t appear in public. But they were forced to step out this time. Clearly, the Nether Divinity Clan was forced to a dead-end.

“Three saints… I’m afraid it’ll be hard for Mu Xuankong to leave!”

“He underestimated the foundation of the Nether Divinity Clan. He’s too naive, wanting to slay a saint by himself.”

“That’s right. It would be more likely to happen if the Radiant Sword Saint were to come here!”

“If this matter isn’t handled well, the Sword Sect’s reputation will fall greatly, even if the Radiant Sword Saint comes in the end.” The Samsara Edict Realm elders of the powerful sects sent here to watch were exclaiming amongst themselves.
