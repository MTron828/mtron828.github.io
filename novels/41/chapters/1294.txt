Chapter 1295 - This Empress Promises You

After placing Lil’ Purple on floor of the third level, Lin Yun removed the Silver Moon Mask with rage flashing through his pupils. He was angry at this moment, and he didn’t bother concealing it. “Did you really consider yourself to be the Supreme Heavenly Slaughtering Empress?!”

His face was cold and terrifying. Even Lil’ Red had never seen Lin Yun so furious before, so it could only hide in a corner.

“W-W-What did I do…?” Lil’ Purple was startled by Lin Yun’s facial expression. Her face was terrifyingly pale with tears welling up in her eyes. She was like a little girl with grievances filling her face.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun ultimately became soft and his complexion softened.

“You…” Lin Yun opened his mouth and sighed, “No matter what you do, don’t push yourself too much. It’s clearly beyond your abilities to seal those demonic corpses. You’re important to me, and I’ll feel bad if anything happens to you because of me.”

“This empress is worried about you, and yet you’re now scolding me? So only you can be concerned about others, while I can’t be concerned about you?” Lil’ Purple sobbed with her head lowered.

“Alright, alright. I was in the wrong,” said Lin Yun while rubbing his head.

“Hmph, this empress doesn’t want to talk to you.” Lil’ Purple’s tears rolled down her cheeks.

“Hehe!” Right at this moment, Lil’ Red took out a flower and raised it before Lil’ Purple. This was a white flower that it had obtained after breaking the seal on a pillar, and the flower was emitting a bizarre fragrance.

“The Aurora Dwelling Flower? Is this for this empress?” Lil’ Purple said with her eyes lit up, which Lil’ Red grinned and nodded its head.

“Hmph. Lil’ Red is the best, unlike someone.” Lil’ Purple smiled while taking the flower, then glanced at Lin Yun. After turning her head away, she handed the flower to Lin Yun because she knew that the flower could help him upgrade the Flower Burial Sword. “But this empress won’t hold it against you. This flower is for you, and I’m also sorry.”

Lin Yun took the flower and looked at Lil’ Purple. “The flower is pretty good, and I’ll accept it. But I still have to say that you didn’t have to do that. If you’re not around, then…”

“Then?” Lil’ Purple asked in an anticipating tone.

“Then, there will be no one who will boast to me and life will be pretty boring,” smiled Lin Yun.

“You!” Lil’ Purple became furious and her face turned red. “Since when did I boast? This empress never boasts! I was born before the heavens and earth, and I won’t die even if the heavens and earth are destroyed!”

But when Lin Yun heard that, the corner of his lips twitched. After removing the sword box from his back, Lin Yun opened it and two swords were revealed. The Lightning Shadow Sword and the Flower Burial Sword. But the Flower Burial Sword couldn’t keep up with him now, and it was even inferior to those saint swords from the Azure Lightning Sect.

So he had to upgrade it to a saint sword or it wouldn’t be able to keep up with him. At the same time, Lil’ Red and Lil’ Purple also came over and watched as Lin Yun crushed the flower. When Lin Yun filled the sword box with flower petals, he raised his head and his gaze landed on Lil’ Purple. It wasn't obvious at first, but the more he looked at Lil’ Purple, the more adorable he found her to be, and he realized that he shouldn’t have been so ferocious to her earlier. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As Lil’ Purple raised her head, her gaze landed on Lin Yun. This made the two of them briefly stunned before they turned to look at Lil’ Red. Just like that, the three of them looked at each other and smiled. This was a warm scene, and perhaps this was the feeling of having a family.

Lin Yun placed his hand out and smiled. “In the future, the three of us will stick together and never separate.”

Lil’ Purple was briefly stunned. She could feel that her heart that she had frozen a hundred thousand years ago was beginning to melt under those words. But she still looked disdainful and said, “Since you put it that way, then I’ll reluctantly agree to it.”

As she spoke, she placed her hand on top of Lin Yun’s hand. Lil’ Red then did the same.

“Hehe.” Lil’ Red looked at Lil’ Purple before turning to Lin Yun and chuckled. This brought a warm smile to Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple’s faces as well. Right at this moment, the Flower Burial Sword began to tremble with a pink light flowing from the sword.

“Looks like the Flower Burial Sword likes the Aurora Dwelling Flower,” said Lin Yun. “I wonder if it can be upgraded to a saint artifact with that.”

“It’ll be hard.” Lil’ Purple said with her brows locked together. “You need an origin saint rune at the very least. This sword has a huge origin, so you’ll need some preparation for it to become a saint sword.”

“I see…” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts before he closed the sword box. Looking ahead, he asked, “Which path should I take?”

“The life path,” said Lil’ Purple.

“Oh?” Lin Yun was surprised. Didn’t Lil’ Purple say that the life and death paths were reversed?

“You’ve changed the fengshui at the previous level since all the items were taken by you. If you walk on the death path again, you’ll die a terrible death,” explained Lil’ Purple.

But when Lin Yun looked at the pathways, the paths all looked the same to him.

“That’s the true dragon aura…” Ye Xun suddenly said, and his words made both Fang Muyang and Xia Yunzhen’s faces change before joy became written on their faces. They could also smell a faint herbal fragrance in the true dragon aura. As they took several deep breaths, they could even feel their blood boiling and a warm current was flowing through their limbs with their astral energies violently circulating.

“Dragon Saint Pellet!” The three of them exchanged a glance with joy on their faces.

“The value of a Dragon Saint Pellet is a lot higher than a Dragon Origin Pellet,” said Ye Xun. He wasn’t a man of many words, but all his words struck a crucial point.

Fang Muyang fell into a brief silence before he smiled. “That’s good. This way, we don’t have to fight it out amongst ourselves. Since there’s a Dragon Saint Pellet on the second floor, this means that there will also be a valuable treasures on this floor. So even if we can’t obtain the quasi-saint origin, our harvest will still be shocking.”

“Let’s quicken our footsteps. I can’t wait!” Xia Yunzhen urged. He had a stronger need for the Dragon Saint Pellet than others because it could upgrade his talisman to a higher level. If he was lucky, his talisman might even be able to possess a dragon spirit, and just thinking about that made his blood start to boil.

Fang Muyang and Ye Xun also quickened their footsteps with smiles on their faces. If Xia Yunzhen really needed it, they could consider it well because they knew that Xia Yunzhen would make it up to them if he took it, and he also wouldn’t compete for the quasi-saint origin that way.

“This underground palace is really a huge opportunity.” Fang Muyang said with his eyes blazing. Even as a transcendent genius, he couldn’t maintain his composure.

As for Ye Xun, he didn’t want to break his image, so he just wore a smile. From that alone, one could tell that he was also pleased with the underground palace. Suddenly, he asked, “I wonder how that person has fared?”

Hearing that, Fang Muyang said in a confident tone, “He’s probably a corpse by now. Even if he’s alive, he’ll probably return instead of continuing in the underground palace.”

Fang Muyang was unhappy with Lin Yun, who rejected his invitation. Since the three of them were in a good mood, their footsteps were a lot quicker. The journey wasn’t easy, and seeing that they would soon reach the core of this level, they couldn’t be bothered about that. When they got close, the true dragon aura became even denser.

“It’s really comfortable. Just taking a whiff alone already feels so great.”

“Producing a Dragon Saint Pellet needs a ceremony. Since there’s a ceremony, there will also be sacrifices. If the two of you can let me have the Dragon Saint Pellet, I won’t take any of the sacrifices. As for the quasi-saint origin, I will also withdraw from it,” said Xia Yunzhen.

“Sounds great. As transcendents, we naturally have to help each other.” Ye Xun and Fang Muyang both wore a smile. The commotion caused by them was great, and it had alarmed the seven demonic corpses the moment they stepped into the core palace.

When the seven demonic corpses turned around, they were enveloped in a demonic aura with their pupils flickering in silver light. The three’s faces changed as they took in a cold breath with a chill down their spines. “Silver-eyed Demonic Corpses!”

Fang Muyang’s face was ugly as he said, “Since the demonic corpses are still here, at least this proves that we’re the first ones to arrive. So the treasures must still be around.”

“Let’s kill them, then.” Ye Xun was decisive and drew out his blade. After being enveloped in a terrifying blade intent, every single swing from his blade was accompanied by a terrifying power and dominance.

“Let’s go!” Fang Muyang and Xia Yunzhen also made their moves and unleashed their attacks. At the same time, the elite disciples of the three sects used their constellations to suppress the seven demonic corpses. This was the terrifying foundation of the eight powerful sects, especially the three who were transcendents. They were a lot stronger than Bai Luli.

An hour later, after the seven demonic corpses were torn to pieces, everyone was suffering some injuries and were catching their breaths. But Xia Yunzhen couldn’t be bothered to rest and flew to the altar.

“Hahaha! The Dragon Saint Pellet is mine!” He couldn’t help laughing, but when he looked down, his smile froze on his face.

At the same time, Ye Xun and Fang Muyang’s faces were ugly because they knew that Xia Yunzhen didn’t use his full strength earlier. Without any hesitation, they also flew to the altar.

But when they saw that the altar was empty, they were completely dumbfounded with their jaws dropped. Not only was there no Dragon Saint Pellet, but there weren’t any sacrifices and this was like a resounding slap to their faces, especially Xia Yunzhen, who furiously roared, “Can anyone tell me what the hell is going on?!”
