Chapter 1563 - Get Past Me First

“Sweep through? Talk only if you can get past me!” Nangong Yan said indifferently. This was the first time he was looked down on after coming back from Profound Wither Island. He didn’t have much rage, but was excited instead. As a terrifying aura swept out from Nangong Yan, a boundless blade intent soared to the sky.

“Firmament!” Nangong Yan’s face sank as his blade intent solidified and emitted a dazzling golden brilliance. When his blade intent merged with the sky, the clouds descended like a screen.

Very quickly, the screen was suspending above everyone, making them think they could touch it just by reaching out. As Nangong Yan’s blade intent grew even stronger, Nangong Yan finally spoke up, “Actually, I’m pretty bored of this gathering. I might not have made it into the Elysium Core Ranking, but I have a high chance of winning against those ranked in the top hundredth by strength.”

The masked man squinted his eyes and said, “Blade and sword intent are the hardest to train. You’re qualified to speak those words since you can grasp the complete mastery of Firmament Blade Intent at the Elysium Core Realm.”

Everyone was surprised while looking at Nangong Yan; even Chang Feng knew why he would lose to Nangong Yan. Generally speaking, one had to reach the Dragon Pulse Realm for the blade or sword intent to reach the fourth grade. Once they grasped it, they could face ten opponents in the same cultivation.

The fact that Nangong Yan could grasp such a terrifying blade intent at the Elysium Core Realm was heaven-defying enough. Countless gazes then fell onto Lin Yun. He was also a heaven-defying genius who grasped the Firmament Sword Intent at the Elysium Core Realm. But it was a pity that he was too young, which meant his cultivation was still too low.

Six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm cultivators were insignificant in this gathering. Otherwise, his identity as the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple and the Firmament Sword Intent he possessed would be enough to outshine Nangong Yan.

“It’s just the Firmament Blade Intent. It doesn’t mean you’re invincible against those in the same generation.” The masked man’s eyes suddenly became sharp as he released a terrifying purple light with a powerful saint aura rising. That was his innate saint physique, and it was the rare Lightning Saint Physique.

When Nangong Yan drew his blade, his blade blazed with flames as he fused his Flame Intent and Blade Intent.

But the masked man merely smiled before he threw a punch forth. As thunder rumbled, bright lightning halos appeared around the masked man that looked like indestructible arrays. When Nangong Yan swung his blade, he instantly destroyed three halos.

The remaining blade ray couldn’t be stopped and reached the masked man in the blink of an eye. One could imagine that if this blade ray landed on the masked man, the masked man would be torn to pieces. Because no matter what saint physique it was, there was no way the physique of someone at the Elysium Core Realm could withstand the power of blade intent at complete mastery.

The masked man took a step back, just as Nangong Yan had expected. When the masked man drew eighteen halos, the halos became connected, engulfing the remaining power of Nangong Yan’s attack into a quagmire.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

When Nangong Yan’s attack dissipated, the masked man stepped forth and threw his punch out. The eighteen lightning halos were enveloping his arm, which made it as heavy as a mountain. Empowered by the eighteen halos, space began to compress in the fist's path and ripples started to spread out in the air.

This changed Nangong Yan’s face because this ordinary attack had destroyed his Firmament Blade Intent. He retreated to put some distance between them before swinging his blade again because he could only unleash the full power of the Firmament Blade Intent by attacking.

If he retreated, his aura would collapse, and he wouldn’t have any odds of winning. But facing his attack, the masked man didn’t panic. His hands then began to fly around in the air as he swiftly moved. When both sides clashed, lightning and sparks enveloped the entire stage.

It wasn’t that terrifying in the beginning. But as both sides began to activate the stars in their violet palace, the lightning and blade rays became increasingly powerful.

“Who the hell is that person?”

“Why can he resist the Firmament Blade Intent just by relying on lightning and his Lightning Saint Physique?”

“He doesn’t seem to have any flaws and is slowly suppressing Nangong Yan so that the latter can’t fully unleash his Firmament Blade Intent.”

This battle made everyone feel like a mountain was weighing down on their chests. The masked man didn’t use any flashy movement techniques, nor was there any earth-shattering phenomenon. He used the most straightforward method everyone could understand to suppress Nangong Yan.

Everyone knew that the blade or sword intent after reaching the fourth grade was terrifying, and no one could take it head-on. But what was happening right now had surpassed everyone’s comprehension, which instilled a thought in everyone’s mind that the fourth grade blade or sword intent wasn’t that terrifying.

Those were the thoughts of ordinary people, but the leaders of every sect had bellows in their hearts. This was because they knew that the masked man had simplified the complicated. The masked man was terrifyingly strong, and they couldn’t believe this was an Elysium Core Realm genius. This instantly made everyone start to wonder about the masked man’s identity.

“Time to end this game!” Suddenly, an abrupt change occurred on the stage as the masked man clasped his hands together. A hundred halos thena appeared in the surroundings overlapping behind him.

In the next second, a terrifying vortex of lightning appeared behind the masked man as an ancient and terrifying power poured out from the vortex, perfectly fusing with the masked man and reaching an alarming height.

When that explosive power reached the limit, all the Elysium Core Realm geniuses present felt like they were suffocating, as if something was stuck in their throats. An innate fear from the depths of their souls spread throughout their bodies, and everyone couldn’t imagine what sort of monster existed in that lightning vortex.

“End this? Hmph, you wish!” Nangong Yan also felt immense pressure as he released a roar with his hair fluttering and face distorted. All eight stars light up in Nangong Yan’s violet palace, and his aura at the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm exploded.

“How is this possible?!”

“Eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm? He made a breakthrough on the spot?!” Boundless astral energy exploded, unleashing the aura of an eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm expert.

This stumped everyone because Nangong Yan made a breakthrough on the spot under the masked man’s pressure. This was simply a miracle, and the tables had turned around in a split second.

“Oh?” The masked man smiled as an ancient seal flew out from the lightning vortex. The seal was purely constructed with light. When the seal entered his body, the entire world became dark, with the masked man being the sole light source.

When the masked man clashed with Nangong Yan, the stage violently shook before a person flew out and fell onto the ground. The person who flew out was Nangong Yan, kneeling on the floor and throwing blood out of his mouth. The blade ray and flames he was emitting swiftly dimmed down as he raised his head to look at the masked man with disbelief.

Ever since he watched the battle between Lin Yun and Qin Cang on the Profound Wither Island, especially Lin Yun’s Firmament Sword Intent, his strength had undergone explosive growth. In addition to his opportunities on the Profound Wither Island, this gave him the confidence to disregard everyone. It was so much so that he no longer considered Lin Yun as his opponent.

His gaze had always been on geniuses like Luo Yuan and Mu Xueqin. He was waiting to reach the Dragon Pulse Realm before challenging them and becoming the strongest under the golden generation. But his dream was shattered before it began. Even after he made a breakthrough at the last minute, he still lost to the masked man.

“What seal is that?!” Nangong Yan asked.

Storing the ancient seal and lightning vortex, the masked man replied, “The Great Sun Seal. The end of the light is the sun, and I obtained this ancient seal while exploring an ancient ruin. You’re strong, but don’t feel bad for losing to me. I have long fused the Great Sun Seal with my Lightning Dao, and both intents have reached the fifth grade. So they’re naturally stronger than your Firmament Blade Intent.”

“I see…” Nangong Yan said with his eyes dimmed.

The other sects were all shocked when they heard that. After all, the Great Sun Seal couldn’t be casually used, not to mention fusing. The slightest mistake and the masked man would kill himself. So this only meant that the masked man’s fortune and talent were too heaven-defying.

“But even without the Great Sun Seal, I can still defeat you. It’s just that it’ll be a little more troublesome,” said the masked man.

His words made everyone take a cold breath because that wasn’t just arrogant alone. He first praised Nangong Yan before humiliating him. If that wasn’t arrogant, then nothing was more arrogant than that.

Nangong Yan’s face changed, but the loser had no right to say anything. He wanted to argue but ultimately gritted his teeth and remained silent.

Since the masked man was the only one standing on the stage, he swept his gaze through the pavilions before locking onto the Sword Sect’s direction. He asked, “Let’s start with the Sword Sect. Ye Ziling, do you dare to challenge me on behalf of the Sword Sect?”

Everyone from the Sword Sect exchanged a glance, and they revealed helpless expressions.

“It’s fine if you don’t dare to fight me. I won’t bully a woman, so you can surrender on behalf of the Sword Sect.” The masked man continued.

“Are you trying to humiliate me?” Ye Ziling said coldly.

“I dare not.” The masked man smiled. “I’m not trying to humiliate you; I just want you to give up representing the Sword Sect. If you don’t dare, Lady Mu can come out. I don’t mind fighting her!”

The surroundings fell into silence when he said that because he wasn’t just humiliating Ye Ziling but the entire Sword Sect. So this made the faces of Mu Xueqin and others ugly.

“You want a fight? I’ll give you a fight, then! My Sword Sect’s courage naturally dares to face any challenge!” Ye Ziling said.

“That works, too. It doesn’t matter who I fight. Just don’t blame me for bullying you.” The masked man smiled.

Luo Yuan was quietly drinking wine in his pavilion with a smile.

Right then, a voice resounded, “You want to challenge her? Have you asked me about it? She’s the daughter of Jian Jingtian, and she’s my best friend. If you want to bully her, you must get past me first.”

Lin Yun slowly stood up from his seat at the Sword Sect's pavilion.
