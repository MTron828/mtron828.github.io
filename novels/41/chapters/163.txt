Chapter 164 - The Sword: Flower Burial

Watching how Lin Yun’s sword aura pierced the yellow-clothed old man greatly impacted the two remaining old men’s mentality. Furthermore, the two old men were also injured by Lin Yun’s Divine Flicking Sword. So, their mental state was shaken and they were scared out of their wits. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

When they saw Lin Yun’s gaze, the two of them were scared to the point that they kneeled on the ground, trembling in fear. They didn’t even dare to raise their heads to look at Lin Yun.

Dead silence filled the North Point Plaza. No one expected that this young man would defeat the infamous Ominous Three. Furthermore, they lost so badly that they were currently on their knees, begging for mercy.

A man should have dignity and not kneel. He should only kneel to the heavens, earth, and his parents. So how could the two old men grovel before someone so easily?

Everyone sighed at this scene. Those three were infamous Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators in the Azure Sun County. But their fate today seemed so unbelievable.

Fifteen minutes ago, no one would have believed that the Ominous Three would kneel before Lin Yun. This scene greatly affected North Point and he was covered in cold sweat. If he hadn’t been tactful and backed down, he would probably be kneeling on the ground as well.

Although this was embarrassing, dignity was the last of the Ominous Three’s concerns. As long as they could keep their lives, they would do anything. From the way they were intimated by Lin Yun in the Azure Sun Realm, you could tell that these three were the type to bully the weak and cower before the strong.

“Cripple your cultivation and leave behind your interspatial pouch. After that, you guys can fuck off.” Lin Yun spoke indifferently.

How ruthless! For the Ominous Three, crippling their cultivation was worse than death.

Naturally, the two old men couldn’t accept this and said in horror, “Sir Lin, we’re willing to leave our interspatial pouch and an arm behind. We will leave the Great Qin Empire. We will make sure that you will never see us again.”

As they spoke, the two of them threw their interspatial pouches to Lin Yun and gnashed their teeth, slicing off their left arms. Blood splattered and a brutal scene unfolded.

Everyone was shocked that the two old men actually chopped their arm off. It seemed that the two had no confidence to face Lin Yun. Then again, it also showed their determination and attitude. If Lin Yun was willing to let them leave without crippling their cultivation, losing an arm was something that they could accept.

“Get lost then.” Lin Yun knew that it wasn’t wise for him to push them any further. If he took it too far, the two of them might try to take him down as well, even if it cost them their life. Since they had already chopped their arms off, they could no longer pose any threat to him. So, Lin Yun did not take it too far.

“Thank you, Sir Lin.” The two old men were relieved. They held onto their broken arms and left.

Lin Yun put the interspatial pouches away and looked at the injuries on the Dragon Blooded Horse before sighing, “You had it tough, brother.”

Plop!

The Dragon Blooded Horse was excited to see Lin Yun. It wanted to get up on its feet as usual, but it ultimately collapsed on the ground in pain.

“The Golden Flame Sect is handling our business here. We’re asking everyone else who’s not related to this matter to leave!”

“The Blood Cloud Sect is here! Get lost if you don’t want to die!”

Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!

At this moment, the clattering sounds of horses approached. The Golden Flame Sect and Blood Cloud Sect’s branches rushed over. The massive plaza was instantly occupied by the two sects, surrounding the auction in layers upon layers.

The spectators changed their expressions and started to leave. With the two sects here, no one dared to stay behind.

Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!

On the taller buildings in the North Point Plaza, there was a group of people. All of them drew their bows tight into the shape of a full moon, armed with arrows made of Profound Iron.

The Golden Flame Sect and Blood Cloud Sect’s experts had taken the higher terrain, completely sealing Lin Yun in the auction area.

They came really quickly… Lin Yun swept his gaze out at the two sects. They had practically sent out everyone. Furthermore, Mei Zihua and Xue Tu were around and they each brought four to five Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators.

Looking at Lin Yun, Xue Tu’s eyes surged with killing intent, “Release the arrows!”

Mei Zihua waved his hand and commanded his men indifferently, “Fire!”

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Hundreds of arrows pierced through the air, flying towards Lin Yun. Every arrow flickered coldly. This was comparable to the strongest attack of the seventh orifice. The arrows were all empowered by Profound Artifact bows. Not even Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators would dare to ignore those arrows.

When the two sects found out about Lin Yun’s location, they immediately took out all the bows that were Profound Artifacts.

They had no intention of letting Lin Yun leave. When the arrows descended, Lin Yun relied on his vision and ears to dodge the arrows, knocking them down with his punches. Some of the arrows would miss and hit the ground. The others were blocked by Lin Yun.

Rounds of arrows were unleashed, descending from the sky like a stormy rain. After a few rounds, all the surrounding buildings were damaged, aside from the wall directly behind Lin Yun.

“Fire the arrows at the horse! Kill that Dragon Blooded Horse!” Xue Tu roared, pointing at the Dragon Blooded Horse when he saw that the arrows couldn’t hit Lin Yun.

The archers immediately switched targets and aimed the arrows at the Dragon Blooded Horse, who was lying on the ground.

“Damn it!” Lin Yun’s face was frosty. He turned around and charged over, using his body to defend the Dragon Blooded Horse. Lin Yun’s body began to glow purple when he activated the Thunderblitz Battle Physique and he received the arrows with his body. Each arrow produced a metallic noise when they collided with Lin Yun.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

When everyone saw this scene, they sucked in a cold breath. They felt that Lin Yun must have gone insane to put his life on the line for a demonic beast.

“Continue! Turn that bastard into a beehive! I’ll see how long his Thunderblitz Battle Physique can last!” Xue Tu revealed a brutal smile when he saw this scene.

Lin Yun was defending the Dragon Blooded Horse from the arrows with his body. He gnashed his teeth and closed his eyes. He could only hear the arrows piercing through the air by his ears.

Whoosh!

When there was a brief gap in the arrows, Lin Yun turned around and his eyes shot wide open. Crimson flames blazed in his eyes that emitted a strong killing aura, which struck fear in the Xiantian Realm cultivators of the two sects. His glare alone had caused the archers from the two sects to slow down a little.

“Fire! Fire!” Xue Tu roared. He too felt a chill run down his spine when he saw Lin Yun’s gaze.

Fwoosh!

Another round of arrows descended in Lin Yun’s direction. Lin Yun became one with the sword and unleashed his incomplete sword intent. The sword aura around him suddenly retracted, replaced by a killing intent that shot out from his brows.

Buzz!

The arrows began to buzz from his killing intent. It felt as if there was an invisible barrier that blocked the arrows.

Lin Yun’s body trembled. His sword intent reverberated through the air as his clothes fluttered. The Flower Burial Sword also responded to his sword intent by popping out from the sword box.

Grabbing onto the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun swung his sword out and shattered the arrows in the sky. His sword intent swept out, assaulting the bows of the archers, which caused the bows to explode.

Pffft!

The archers spat out mouthfuls of blood and many of them fell from the roof of the buildings.

“Two overlord forces of the Azure Sun County have to resort to such a despicable method to deal with me? Mei Zihua, Xue Tu, why don’t you two stand before me like men?” Lin Yun pointed his sword out with a smile.

When Mei Zihua and Xue Tu listened to his words, their faces turned ugly. The two of them were famous in the Azure Sun County and they had no rival among the younger generation. They had never suffered such humiliation.

If it were another time, they would definitely stand out and accept the challenge. But the two of them knew that Lin Yun was powerful, so they could only swallow their pride even though they were furious.

“You’re still sharp-tongued even when facing death? Where’s the Blood Guards!” Xue Tu barked.

“Here!”

Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!

A group walked out of the Blood Cloud Sect’s party. They were all in the sixth orifice of the Xiantian realm. All of them wore crimson clothes and masks. Every single one of them emitted dense killing aura. Their eyes were icy cold, holding no emotions.

“Golden Flame Sect’s Death Corp, heed my orders! Capture Lin Yun, dead or alive!” Mei Zihua waved his hand. A group of black-clothed men stepped forward with expressionless faces.

The Golden Flame Sect and Blood Cloud Sect had both groomed over a hundred soldiers in their death squads. All of them emitted an eerie killing intent as they charged at Lin Yun with their weapons.

When the two death squads appeared, the North Point Plaza’s temperature started to plummet from the killing intent.

“C-cold…”

“The two sects are really gone big this time. I’m afraid that Lin Yun won’t be able to escape today.”

“I’ve never heard of the two sects being so cautious when dealing with a fifth orifice cultivator.”

“Haha, how can they not be cautious? Did you not see the Ominous Three’s outcome?”

“When dealing with someone like Lin Yun, you either befriend him or kill him. If you want to kill him, you have to make sure that he doesn’t turn the tables around. The two sects seem determined to take his life.” The spectators all felt a chill run down their spines. The death squads charged with the intention of putting their lives on the line. If it came down to it, they wouldn't hesitate to perish with their enemy.

Not even Profound Martial Realm cultivators were willing to provoke such existences. Then again, it wasn’t cheap to groom a death squad. Unless absolutely necessary, no one would dispatch their death squad. But today, both sects had mobilized all their death squads.

“Kill!”

Clang! Clang!

The death squads pulled their weapons out. The killing intent from their weapons raised a cold wind in the surrounding.

Boom!

Suddenly, the wall behind Lin Yun abruptly exploded. Countless figures charged through the tumbling wall like a tidal wave, raising a cloud of dust in the process.

“Disciples of the Radiant Sect! Those who dare to touch Lin Yun are enemies of the Radiant Sect who need to be killed!” Ming Ye’s voice echoed out like a thundering roar.
