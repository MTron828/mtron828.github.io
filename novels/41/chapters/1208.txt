Chapter 1209 - Don't Scare Me!

Test the sword again? Lin Yun smiled because he could sense a playful gaze from the surroundings. After all, he had snapped the Incineration Sword, which left a deep impression on everyone. He had broken a saint artifact that was comparable to a thousand rune saint artifact and was only left with the sword hilt.

This made Lin Yun wonder if the Lightning Shadow Sword would also snap. Truth be told, everyone was wondering if Lin Yun would also snap the Lightning Shadow Sword.

The Incineration Sword broke too quickly and no one was able to catch what happened. Now that the Lightning Shadow Sword had appeared, they would pay close attention.

“Don’t tell me that the Lightning Shadow Sword will also snap,” smiled Gong Haoran.

“Shut your mouth.” Zhao Yan glared at him. There was no way the Incineration Sword could compare to the Lightning Shadow Sword. No matter how strong a hundred rune saint artifact was, it was ultimately a hundred rune saint artifact. The value of a thousand rune saint artifact was entirely different, not to mention that it was one forged by the Mo Clan. Even a Dragon Pulse Realm expert would be tempted by it.

“Don’t worry. There’s no way the Lightning Shadow Sword will snap. I was just joking,” smiled Gong Haoran. He didn’t think that the Lightning Shadow Sword would snap, not to mention that there was no reason for Lin Yun to do that.

When Lin Yun stood on the stage, he could hear the discussion from the surroundings. It seemed like the crowd was certain that he destroyed the Incineration Sword on purpose to embarrass the Feng Clan.

“Haha. These country bumpkins are so naive. Lin Yun, snap the Lightning Shadow Sword and let them know how powerful your physique is!” Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded out from the sword box.

But Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with her. Furthermore, there were no rules that he had to draw the sword publicly since it was a different situation from the Incineration Sword. Back then, Feng Xuanzi wanted to show off and requested Lin Yun to show everyone the sword that he forged.

Lin Yun was trying to be considerate since he had a vague understanding of his ‘broken sword’ physique. The better the sword, the longer it would take for that sword to snap. This also meant that the lower the grade, the faster the sword would snap. The Incineration Sword managed to last long enough that Lin Yun wondered if his ‘broken sword’ physique failed.

The Lightning Shadow Sword would take even longer to snap. So Lin Yun decided to give it a try. After all, this sword didn’t even belong to him. It didn’t seem wrong for him to bring back the sword hilt to the old man.

Thinking about it, Lin Yun no longer felt any burden in his heart. In a split second, he dashed towards the Lightning Shadow Sword and grabbed the hilt. He could sense an ancient aura blowing at him even before he brandished the sword. Lin Yun could imagine that this sword was on a whole new level compared to the Incineration Sword.

After making his decision, Lin Yun examined the sword hilt briefly before he started to unsheath it. But the outcome was embarrassing because the sword wouldn’t budge no matter how he tried.

“What’s going on?”

“Is the sword not recognizing Lin Yun?”

“Looks like Lin Yun didn’t receive the recognition of that sword. Is it because his cultivation is too low?” An uproar sounded out from the surroundings when the crowd saw what was happening. After a sword reached a certain grade, it would have a temper of its own, which was called spirituality. It was normal if one couldn’t draw the sword without receiving the sword’s recognition.

But it was weird for this to happen to Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun was a genius who made it through the third stage, not to mention that his attainment in the sword was unrivaled. Not even an expert in the Elysium Core Realm expert could compete with him.

“Lil’ Purple, what’s going on?” Lin Yun transmitted his voice to Lil’ Purple.

“Interesting. This sword seems to have a huge origin and won’t submit to you,” smiled Lil’ Purple.

“It truly is the old geezer’s sword. Its temper is just as foul as the old geezer’s temper. But I don’t believe that I can’t do this!” Lin Yun immediately thought of the old geezer’s foul temper, which made Lil’ Purple scoff. Lin Yun’s temper didn’t seem any better in her eyes.

As Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art, the Azure Dragon Mark appeared on his chest as a hundred dragon runes began to appear on the surface of his body. At the same time, Lin Yun’s vitality began to surge within his body as each dragon rune poured into his hand and manifested a dragon claw.

As lightning rumbled in the sky, the phenomenon belonging to the Azure Dragon Saint Art began to appear. This made Lin Yun lock his brows together and grit his teeth as sweat appeared on his forehead.

A long time later, Lin Yun finally managed to pull the sword out by an inch. In that split second, a dazzling sword ray shined brightly that forced many people to close their eyes. As immense pressure swept out, fear began to appear in the hearts of all the swordsmen in the plaza.

“My sword intent is going out of control…” Zhao Yan’s face changed as he was horrified to discover that his sword intent was bowing towards the Lightning Shadow Sword. His body stiffened before he fell onto his knees. But he wasn’t the only one as the sword intent of swordsmen in the Dragon Pulse Realm was doing the same thing.

As Lin Yun let out a ferocious roar, he finally pulled the sword out of the sheath. Lightning tore through the sky as the sword brightly radiated. A terrifying pressure spread out into the surroundings that would occasionally manifest a profound rune. It was a complete divine rune that instantly made all the swordsmen under the Dragon Pulse Realm fall to their knees with pale faces. It was like their hearts were being clenched by someone.

“A divine rune!” The audience was shocked to see the rune shining behind Lin Yun. At the same time, they also knew why the Feng Clan wasn’t willing to hand over the sword. It seemed like Feng Xuanzi wanted to play tricks even after Lin Yun had passed three rounds. After all, the core rune of the sword wasn’t a saint rune but a complete divine rune.

They couldn’t imagine how someone managed to engrave a divine rune on a sword and what material could bear the power of a divine rune. There weren’t many thousand rune saint artifacts that could compare to this sword.

“This sword has the potential to become a divine artifact…” Lil’ Purple’s shocked voice sounded out from the sword box. Even in ancient times, it was hard to engrave a divine rune on a saint artifact. After the Golden Era, divine runes were practically lost and there weren’t many who could still grasp the power of the divine runes.

“The old geezer is really fortunate,” sighed Lin Yun while he looked at the Lightning Shadow Sword. This was truly a good sword and the dream of all swordsmen. Furthermore, this sword was extremely pure and it was perfect for a swordsman who grasped the lightning intent.

Speaking of which, he had also grasped the lightning intent and also comprehended the Azure Dragon Sword Aura. This meant that the power of his Azure Dragon Sword Aura would rise with the help of this sword.

When Lin Yun held onto the Lightning Shadow Sword, he could feel the Flower Burial Sword buzzing in the sword box as if it was complaining. This made Lin Yun smile because he knew that the Flower Burial Sword was jealous.

The Lightning Shadow Sword was good, but the Flower Burial Sword was perfect for him. As Lin Yun thought about this, the Flower Burial Sword calmed down. It clearly could sense his thoughts. Just when Lin Yun was focused on the Lightning Shadow Sword, cracks began to appear on the divine rune behind him, which made Lil’ Purple exclaim, “Quick! Drop the sword! The sword is going to break!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun was startled awake and quickly tried to sheath the sword. But the sword seemed to be angry as it started to battle Lin Yun’s ‘broken sword’ physique. The ‘broken sword’ that had been silent in Lin Yun’s body for a long time instantly released a cold flash.

Along with the cold flash, more cracks began to appear on the divine rune behind Lin Yun. However, the radiance from the Lightning Shadow Sword grew brighter with all sorts of terrifying phenomena taking form. It was like the face-off between two ferocious beasts that made the Dragon Pulse Realm seniors on the platform feel terrible.

All of them were facing immense pressure and their knees were bending beyond their control. When those experts looked around, they were full of disbelief. Everyone in the surroundings were bending their knees.

Only Luo Hua retained her position as she looked at Lin Yun with doubt. When Luo Hua placed her hand on Bai Ting’s shoulder, the pressure was immediately alleviated. Getting back up on his feet, Bai Ting wiped the sweat on his forehead and gasped for his breath, “Y-Young Master Luo, what’s going on?”

“That sword… seems to be on the verge of breaking,” said Luo Hua in an uncertain tone.

Her words immediately made Bai Ting’s face turn pale as he fell onto the ground once more. After all, it was the Lightning Shadow Sword with a divine rune. He couldn’t even begin to imagine how the sect master would react if he knew that the sword broke.
