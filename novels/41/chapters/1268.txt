Chapter 1269 - Massacre (1)

“How about it? What do you think of my suggestion?” The fatty smiled with his eyes squinted while he looked at Lin Yun. Because of how chubby he was, it made him look exceptionally ‘friendly’.

“That means I’ll have to hand over the Azure Dragon Saint Art if I join your Myriad Beast Gate and I won’t be able to compete for this Dragon Blood Fruit?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s for sure.” The fatty smiled. “You have to hand it over to a saint if you want to perfect your body-refining technique. As a reward, you will be bestowed the complete version of the body-refining technique. If you stand behind me now, I can spare your life. But this also means that you won’t have the qualification to compete for the quasi-saint elixir once it appears.”

“Is that so?” The corner of Lin Yun’s lips rose and smiled. “What a pity. Because I have to obtain the Dragon Blood Fruit, no matter what.”

Lin Yun’s words made everyone’s faces change. But the fatty continued with his smile, “How regretful. Without a saint behind you, we naturally have to make you nourishment for the Dragon Blood Fruit. I really feel bad for you.”

“Blacky, you’re really benevolent to waste so much time talking to a piece of garbage like him. Just make him kneel before you and beg for mercy before giving him a few slaps. He’ll definitely share the body-refining technique with you. If you don’t want to do it, why don’t I help you do it on your behalf? I’ll show you the methods of my Silverblood Elysium!” A silver-haired man said.

“Let me do it.” The woman who attacked Lin Yun earlier stood up. The next second, she was enveloped in flames and a flaming bird faintly tok shape behind her, emitting a divine aura.

“Let me do it myself.” The fatty revealed a sinister smile before he mocked, “Let me experience the power of the Azure Dragon Saint Art, and let me see where his confidence comes from!”

“Do I look like a pushover?” Lin Yun was somewhat surprised. These people were starting to annoy him from how they sounded as though they could easily crush him.

“It’s not whether you’re a pushover, we’ve killed plenty of prideful geniuses like you! You have a strong vitality, and no one knows if you alone can enhance the Dragon Blood Fruit into a saint elixir!” The fatty roared before he charged forth while being enveloped in a baleful aura.

In the next second, he was shrouded in a black light, looking like an ancient beast, and charged forth. When the boundless vitality within his body poured out like an ocean, this instantly made Zhao Yan’s face change.

The fatty’s name was Luo Kun, a genius with the mutated Blackblood Barbaric Bull’s bloodline. He was a body-refining expert and, paired with his bloodline, one could imagine how terrifying he was. Previously, when Zhao Yan fought Luo Kun, he suffered because Luo Kun’s physique was strong and was even comparable to saint artifacts.

His sword intent couldn’t inflict any injuries on the latter while the latter easily destroyed his sword aura with just one punch. If the fatty wasn’t around, Zhao Yan wouldn’t have lost so terribly. Not to mention that with Gongsun Yan around, they might have even had a little chance at winning the fight against the other geniuses.

Lin Yun was also surprised when he sensed Luo Kun’s aura. This was the first time he had seen a genius with such a terrifying physique ever since he came to Kunlun Realm.

“That fellow has the bloodline of an ancient demonic beast, not to mention that he’s from the Myriad Beast Gate. So he has been tempering his physique from a young age and has reached a terrifying height,” said Zhao Yan.

When Luo Kun threw a punch out, it felt as if there were countless stars falling from the sky and even the entire sky began to tremble under his punch. But Lin Yun didn’t fear Luo Kun and circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art. When eight hundred dragon runes poured into his palm, he pushed his palm forth. His palm first manifested into a dragon claw before the dragon runes shone brightly.

This confrontation was too terrifying, making even the surrounding space tremble. But that wasn’t all. When Lin Yun unleashed the azure dragon aura, the entire snowy mountain also began to tremble.

When the purple-golden light dispersed, a shocking scene appeared before everyone. Luo Kun was actually sent flying back instead with blood dripping from his hand.

“W-What’s going on?” The remaining seven geniuses were shocked to find out that there was someone in the Galaxy Stage who could confront a quasi-Elysium Core Realm expert from the Myriad Beast Gate head-on.

“Impressive. Not only are you still alive, but your arm isn’t crippled.” Lin Yun muttered. He didn’t think that it was because his physique was weak. After all, his physique has reached a terrifying height thanks to numerous opportunities. Although he didn’t ignite the saint rune in the Azure Dragon Mark, he also didn’t hold back with this attack.

If an ordinary genius faced his attack head-on, even if that genius was at the quasi-Elysium Core Realm, this attack alone could take half of their life.

But when the fatty heard what Lin Yun said, he was so furious that he threw out a mouthful of blood. He had been refining his physique from a young age, but he actually lost in a head-on confrontation. So, how could he not be furious about that?

“You’re courting death!” Luo Kun furiously roared and immediately brought out a halberd, along with his constellation, before swinging it at Lin Yun.

Seeing this, Lin Yun no longer held back and activated the saint rune within the Azure Dragon Mark, enveloping him in a bright light. Then, he threw out both of his fists like two dragons.

When the saint rune activated, the dragon runes on the surface of his body instantly became comparable to saint runes, bringing his physique close to the toughness of a thousand-rune saint artifact.

When he clashed with Luo Kun, their attacks unleashed a terrifying aura a hundred miles wide with the snowy mountain at the center. Everyone who was collecting the saint liquid could sense this terrifying aura and this made them turn to look in the direction of the snowy mountain with deep shock.

“Well done, Brother Luo! Let him know how strong you are!” The armored woman smiled. She had been holding a grudge against Lin Yun ever since her attack was unable to inflict any injuries on Lin Yun.

But after a hundred moves, Luo Kun was sent flying back, accompanied by a draconic roar. A terrifying hole had appeared on his chest with blood flowing from it. If he didn’t have his powerful physique, Lin Yun’s punch might have even pierced through him, destroying his heart.

This scene left the seven geniuses stunned because it was too sudden and they still couldn’t accept it.

The face of the silver-haired youth from the Silverblood Elysium became serious. “Let’s help. This is a tough opponent, and this person is a lot stronger than that piece of garbage from the Sword Emperor’s lineage.”

Among the seven of them, there were those who were stronger than Luo Kun. But even they couldn’t easily defeat Luo Kun within a hundred moves.

Meanwhile, Gongsun Yan’s face became uglier when he heard that because he was humiliated once more.

“All eight of us have never joined hands before. But it’s about time for the Dragon Blood Fruit to be born, and he has the qualification.” The armored woman said with killing intent brewing within her. She was satisfied with Lin Yun’s vitality. With Lin Yun, the Dragon Blood Fruit would definitely become a saint elixir. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

In the next moment, the seven of them and the injured Luo Kun soared into the sky and emitted a terrifying aura.

“No need. I, alone, am enough.” Lin Yun gently pushed Zhao Yan, who wanted to help. His shove coincidentally sent Zhao Yan out of the array and he landed beside Gongsun Yan, giving the latter a scare. But when they looked at each other, Gongsun Yan couldn’t help feeling awkward.

The reason why Lin Yun sent Zhao Yan away was because the latter’s injuries were too heavy and he couldn’t help him much. Lin Yun was determined to start a massacre, and he didn’t want anyone around who might distract him.
