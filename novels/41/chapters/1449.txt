Chapter 1450 - Spirit of the Stone Monument

As the sky became filled with a heavy mist, the wind was blowing loudly in their ears as Lin Yun and Chen Ling shuttled through the clouds like immortals with the vast mountain range of the Sword Sect beneath them.

Fifteen minutes later, they were wrapped in sword rays as they descended towards a massive floating mountain. This floating island was unique. Its position was higher than the seven main peaks in the Sword Sect. On the enormous platform was a towering palace that pierced into the clouds. This was the Great Profound Palace!

The Sword Sect had several special grounds. They were the Ancient Saint Mountain, Great Profound Palace, Celestial Observing Stage, and the Heavenly Sword Woods.

The Saint Mountain had existed since ancient times, and the Sword Sect occupied it. Beneath the Saint Mountain was the saint vein that the Sword Sect had accumulated over a hundred thousand years. That was where the saints entered seclusion, and not even Samsara Edict Realm experts qualified to step inside. Then again, it was different for the saints’ disciples.

The Celestial Observing Stage was unique because it was a place for disciples to temper their sword intents. In the past, there was another place for Sword Sect’s disciples to temper their sword intents. But when Yu Qingfeng destroyed two peaks three thousand years ago, the sword ray he left behind was still in existence even after three thousand years.

So the Sword Sect’s saint lords discussed amongst themselves and chose to leave Yu Qingfeng’s sword intent behind to remind them of their shame. Secondly, they could use the sword ray for disciples to comprehend sword intent. Thus, they shifted the initial Celestial Observing Stage and rebuilt the place.

This also proved the Sword Sect’s determination and breadth of mind. If it was another sect that was in their position, they might not have made the same decision. After all, it was humiliating to admit that someone was stronger than them.

The Heavenly Sword Woods was a place where was a forest of saint swords, which was meant for disciples to practice their sword techniques.

The majestic palace standing before Lin Yun was the Sword Sect's last and final unique place, the Great Profound Palace. Inside the palace was Sword Sect’s most profound martial technique, the Great Profound Sword Canon. It cost a hundred thousand contribution points to enter. Even if a disciple didn’t have enough contribution points, they could comprehend the Dao by standing close to it.

So, many disciples would gather here whenever they encountered a bottleneck in their cultivation. This place was similar to the Saint Pool, where you could be close to it to use for cultivation.

“That seems to be Lin Yun!”

“He’s Lin Yun? The heaven direct disciple Lin Yun?”

“He’s finally here. I thought he’d wait for the commotion to settle before coming…”

“Bullshit. It’s naturally better for him to come earlier. Who doesn’t want to enter the Great Profound Palace?” Lin Yun and Chen Ling’s appearance attracted everyone’s attention, causing an uproar in front of the Great Profound Palace.

Everyone stopped their cultivations and directed their gazes over. They couldn’t help it because Lin Yun was pretty much a celebrity in the Sword Sect, and there was no way he could maintain a low profile even if he wanted to.

Lin Yun gave Xiahou Yan a beating before he entered the Sword Sect, saving the Sword Sect’s reputation. When he came to the Divine Firmament Peak, he stayed in the Saint Pool for a month and even alarmed the sect master, before he was given the status as a heaven direct disciple. Not even the top ten of the Heaven Ranking were as popular as Lin Yun lately. It was fortunate that they didn’t know that the sect master gave Lin Yun the Divine Golden Crow Iron, or it would cause an even bigger uproar.

“Senior Brother Lin, I’m not wrong, right?” Chen Ling smiled as he turned to Lin Yun. “You’re a celebrity now. It has been long since our Divine Firmament Peak has had any sense of existence.”

Lin Yun responded with a smile as he raised his head to look at the towering Great Profound Palace. He asked, “What’s so special about this palace?”

“I have no idea. I’ve never gone in because I don’t have enough contribution points. I already spent most of them to exchange for the Primordial Netherserpent Sword.” Chen Ling was a little envious and continued with a helpless tone, “But I do know some information about it.”

“Oh? I’m all ears.” Lin Yun smiled. He wasn’t in a hurry to enter the Great Profound Palace.

“In the Elysium Core Realm, you will only be given the mantra for the first three stages if you pick one of the five sword sutras. After reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, only then can you continue cultivating the next portion.” Chen Ling explained. “Generally speaking, those who cultivate the sword sutras of the other four peaks can reach the complete first stage just by entering the Great Profound Palace.”

“What about our Divine Firmament Peak?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s…” Chen Ling was a little awkward as he continued, “No one has picked the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra while they were in the Elysium Core Realm for the past few years because no one could succeed in the Elysium Core Realm. But Dragon Pulse Realm disciples gave it a try and managed to reach the lesser first stage after entering the Great Profound Palace, which is already impressive.”

Chen Ling gave Lin Yun a disclaimer for him to be prepared by using two examples before he added, “You should have other sword sutras as well, right? If there’s no response from the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, you can give your other sword sutra an attempt.”

“That won’t be necessary.” Lin Yun smiled. He didn’t dare to touch the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon because the cauldron would leave his ocean of astral energy if he continued.

“I’ll be going in, then.” Lin Yun patted Chen Ling’s shoulder before he walked into the Great Profound Palace.

“I’ll wait for you here.” Chen Ling nodded and found a place to sit down on the stairs.

“Lin Yun, you don’t seem to be worried about the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra at all.” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the sword box. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I don’t dare to talk about my comprehension of other martial techniques, but no one within the same generation can surpass me when it comes to Sword Dao.” Lin Yun was pretty confident in that matter. Most importantly, he had an advantage that no one could be compared to, and that was his dual sword souls.

When he practiced the Aquaheaven Sword Technique, Lin Yun relied on his dual sword souls to summon the holy spirit in just two days.

“The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra is different. Furthermore, sword sutra and sword technique aren’t the same.” Lil’ Purple replied.

“Aren’t you around? I bet you understand more about the nether energy than my martial uncle…” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph, that’s for sure. With this empress around, you can surely practice that Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.” Lil’ Purple’s tone suddenly changed and was filled with pride.

While they were chatting, Lin Yun eventually arrived before the Great Profound Palace. The two elders guarding this place nodded their heads after Lin Yun showed his medal.

When Lin Yun came before the gate of the Great Profound Palace, he took a deep breath. He wasn’t as confident as he sounded with the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, but he also knew that he couldn’t back down now since he already came.

Lin Yun slowly pushed open the gates and entered the Great Profound Palace under countless envious gazes. The interior was different from what Lin Yun had imagined, since the inside was dark. He could hear his footsteps echoing in the palace while he slowly walked towards the center of it.

Time here seemed to have slowed down, making Lin Yun lose the concept of time as he continued walking toward the center of the palace. he eventually saw a gigantic stone monument. The stone monument was engraved with ancient runes that covered the entire monument.

This is the Great Profound Sword Canon? But it was a pity that Lin Yun couldn’t recognize any of the words. Looking at those ancient runes, he could sense boundless information flowing into his mind, trying to tear his mind apart. This instantly made his back become covered in a cold sweat before he quickly shifted his gaze away.

This incident made Lin Yun much more cautious as he slowed his pace while approaching the stone monument. As he gradually approached the monument, he could sense a terrifying fluctuation coming from it that was similar to the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron. But the intent contained within the monument was entirely different.

The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron was filled with an annihilation intent, trying to drive him to commit a massacre; it was a demonic cauldron. On the contrary, the intent of the monument was majestic and sacred, but the power contained within wasn’t any weaker than the cauldron. Most importantly, the power contained within the monument was a lot stronger than the cauldron soul in Lin Yun’s violet palace.

“Stop right there!” A voice echoed within the empty palace.

“Who’s speaking?” Lin Yun cautiously looked around.

“Me.” That voice sounded out once more.

This surprised Lin Yun as his gaze suspiciously fell onto the monument that was a hundred meters away. He replied, “You?”

“It is I.”

This time, Lin Yun widened his mouth and was surprised because the monument was talking to him!

“I’m the spirit of the stone monument. Why are you so shocked? Don’t you also have an artifact spirit in your sword box?” A disdainful voice resounded from the stone monument.

Lin Yun’s face froze when he heard that. He didn’t think that there would be anyone else who could sense Lil’ Purple’s existence. After all, not even his master, the Radiant Sword Saint, could detect Lil’ Purple. Then again, it was possible that his master had discovered it but didn’t say anything.

“Empress, what should I do?”

“This artifact spirit is a little weird. It’s the spirit of the stone monument, but it’s also the canon spirit of the Great Profound Sword Canon. Lin Yun, don’t you think the runes on the Great Profound Sword Canon are too similar to the cauldron? They’re of the same origin!” Lil’ Purple replied.

This surprised Lin Yun because he didn’t notice it earlier since this place was too dark. He couldn’t see clearly even after using his sword intent, so he ignored it.

“What kind of runes are they?”

“It’s called the Divine Scripture of Chaos, born in primal chaos. Every word contains the law of heaven and earth. Even if you recognize the runes, you can’t really describe it or write it out.” Lil’ Purple explained.

So the Great Profound Sword Canon and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon are on the same level? Lin Yun was really surprised. This meant that the Sword Sect had a terrifying foundation as a former holy land.

“What are you muttering about? Are you badmouthing me with your artifact spirit?” When Lin Yun was talking to Lil’ Purple, a figure flew out from the stone monument. This was a fatty with the appearance of a child roughly seven or eight years old. He was sitting on the monument, sending a suspicious look towards Lin Yun.

This made Lin Yun widen his eyes in disbelief. This is the spirit of the stone monument? Isn’t the contrast a little too huge?

A brief moment later, after Lin Yun recovered from the shock, he replied, “No, no. We’re talking about the words on the monument.”

“Oh, they’re the Divine Scripture of Chaos. Don’t look at it too much, or it’ll blow your mind apart…” The little fatty made a ‘mind-blowing’ gesture as he spoke to Lin Yun in a solemn tone.

Lin Yun smiled when he heard that because this fatty was pretty adorable.

“Let your artifact spirit come out and talk to me. It has been a long time since I’ve come out.” The little fatty looked at Lin Yun with a strong desire in his pupils.

“You’ve never shown yourself?” Lin Yun asked in surprise.

“I’m afraid that I’ll scare them. Besides, no one else had an artifact spirit. So I won’t play with them. Oh, Stone is my name. What’s the name of your artifact spirit?” The little fatty was more focused on Lin Yun’s artifact spirit. He must be really bored and wished to find a companion.

“Empress, do you want to come out and play with him a little?” Lin Yun asked.

“No way. This empress won’t play with children!” Lil’ Purple said in a disdainful tone.
