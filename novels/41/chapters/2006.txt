Chapter 2007 - Trap

The Blood Crow Tribe was flocking with Blood Crows, and the mist in the sky was due to the density of their ominous auras, making the Blood Crows look like an entire army in these plains.

The thought of clashing with the Blood Crows head-on never crossed Lin Yun’s mind, and it was no different from courting death. But he could use his intelligence instead. While being disguised as a Blood Crow, he wouldn’t attract anyone’s attention as long as he was careful. This was because there were too many Blood Crows here.

When Lin Yun got close, ten miles from the tribe’s core, he stopped and examined the five Blood Crow Kings. Lin Yun was fearful of the Blood Crow Kings, especially since these five Blood Crow Kings were a lot more terrifying than the Blood Crow King he faced in the past.

Their wings were stronger, and their wing bones were silver with engraved runes. This was equivalent to an unrefined saint artifact and wasn’t weaker than Glory Saint Artifacts. Lin Yun wasn’t stupid enough to face five enemies by himself.

“That demon is too ruthless and shameless. A swordsman like him actually resorted to sneak attacks. If this continues, all of the thousand-year Blood Crows will be butchered by him!” A few Blood Crows furiously roared.

“God knows where that demon went. We’ve searched for a few days and yet we still can’t find him anywhere! We can only hide here now to be safe,” a thousand-year Blood Crow reluctantly said.

Lin Yun finally understood why the surrounding thousand-year Blood Crows were decreasing. It turned out that they were hiding here.

“I want to eat humans! Human flesh is too tempting!”

“Isn’t that obvious? Their blood is more delicious than wine, but we can’t go anywhere because of that demon!”

“It’s a pity he’s too smart and unwilling to step into this place. Otherwise, he would be dead!”

Lin Yun’s ears twitched when he heard that, and he asked, “Won’t we be trapped here if that demon comes in?”

“You must be new here. There’s a Yin-Yang Bloodlust Array. So that demon will only die if he comes in.”

“That’s right. We have five kings here, and any of them can easily butcher him. We’re only afraid that the demon won’t come in,” a crooked-mouthed Blood Crow said cockily.

Lin Yun glanced at him and noticed that these two were Blood Crows who had reached a thousand years and could be considered elites of the Blood Crow Tribe.

Lin Yun began to wonder what the Yin-Yang Bloodlust Array was. But it should be related to the crimson mist, and Lin Yun had long noticed it was weird.

“What’s the Yin-Yang Bloodlust Array? Is it that strong?” Lin Yun asked.

“Hehe. It’s naturally invincible!” The crooked-mouthed Blood Crow laughed, “All five kings are required to activate the array. The moment the array is activated, even Quasi-Saints will be killed, not to mention that demon!”

The Blood Crow beside that crooked-mouth Blood Crow exclaimed in shock, and this only made the crooked-mouthed Blood Crow even more smug.

“Who created this array?” Lin Yun asked.

“Our ancestor. This array is powerful even in the outside world. After all, our ancestor has lived for over ten thousand years!” The crooked-mouth Blood Crow said.

“If it was not for the fact that the ancestor can’t leave, even a hundred of that demon wouldn’t be able to do anything to us.”

Right then, the head of the Blood Crow, which Lin Yun used as a shell, exploded, and Lin Yun was sent flying away.

“What’s going on?!” The surrounding Blood Crows exclaimed in shock, and they panicked.

“Not good, it’s the white-clothed demon!” The crooked-mouthed Blood Crow quickly ran away in fright. But Lin Yun had long set his sights on him, and the crooked-mouthed Blood Crow clashed with Lin Yun head-on when it turned around.

Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword, slicing that crooked-mouthed Blood Crow into two. he didn’t remain there for long after that and executed the Divine Sunchasing Art. The Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him, like a bright sun under the crimson clouds.

“It’s that demon!”

“The demon is here!”

“Quick, run for your lives!” Lin Yun’s appearance flustered the surrounding Blood Crows, and they began to scatter about.

“Hehe, you’re here at the right time. Battle Shift King, you stay behind while we go after him!” A Blood Crow King quickly chased after Lin Yun with three Blood Crow Kings behind him. They were strong and turned into four blood streaks, tearing apart the sky and disappearing.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The Battle Shift King released its aura and coldly said, “Calm down! Four kings have gone to chase after him, and that demon will undoubtedly die.”

The surrounding Blood Crows calmed down after sensing the Battle Shift King’s aura. On the altar, the Battle Shift King rested and looked majestic.

The four Blood Crow Kings were all at the Azure Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm, and their full speed was much faster than Lin Yun’s. They were aerial beasts and grasped the powerful Wind Intent at birth, even if they weren’t proficient in martial techniques.

“What powerful sword intent!”

“Over there!”

Lin Yun's sword ray was dazzling, containing a powerful aura.

“Hehe. He’s dead for sure, this time!” The Blood Crow King leading the party said in excitement. It had a feeling that it could make a breakthrough if it devoured Lin Yun.

“Quick, chase after him!” The other Blood Crow Kings were also excited and increased their speed.

Fifteen minutes later, they finally caught up to Lin Yun. But only a sword was hovering above a stone ahead, and Lin Yun was nowhere to be seen.

“Shit! We fell for his trap!” The Blood Crow King leading the party came to his senses and cursed.

“Silver Gale King, what’s the matter?” The other Blood Crow Kings asked.

“He lured us away on purpose. The Battle Shift King is in danger! The demon must’ve gone back!” The Silver Gale King said. “But he’s really careless to leave behind his sword. He thought I wouldn’t recognize this sword as a Glory Saint Artifact. Without this sword, that demon’s strength will drop greatly. The fourth brother will stay behind while we return and help the fifth brother to kill that demon!”

The other Blood Crow Kings came to their senses after hearing what the Silver Gale King said. The Silver Gale King led the two other Blood Crow Kings back, flying even faster than before. “Hmph, we’ll return!”

“Where’s that demon?” When the three Blood Crow Kings returned to the altar, they were confused upon seeing the Battle Shift King resting on it.

“What demon? Didn’t you guys go to chase after him? Where’s the fourth brother?” The Battle Shift King asked in confusion.

“What?!” The Silver Gale King roared, “We fell for his trap. That demon’s target must be the fourth brother. We don’t have time to talk and must return quickly!”

Just like that, the three Blood Crow Kings furiously rushed back. But when they returned, the Blood Crow King left behind was nowhere to be seen. There was also no traces of battle in the surroundings.

The three Blood Crow Kings gathered around the Flower Burial Sword once more.

“We fell for his trap yet again! The fourth brother must’ve returned to help us. That demon is too cunning! Third brother, you stay behind and remember not to touch this sword,” the Silver Gale King said. “This is a Glory Saint Artifact, and that demon can’t give up this sword. If he returns for it, don’t fight him; just hold him off from afar.”

“Okay! Big brother, leave it to me!”

With that, the two Blood Crow Kings returned once more. But the moment they left, the Flower Burial Sword suddenly flew a few hundred meters away. This naturally made the Blood Crow King who was left behind, curious and chased after the sword. It remembered what the Silver Gale King said not to lose that sword. Without him knowing it, he was lured a hundred meters away and entered the depths of the forest.

“Fourth brother!” The Blood Crow King exclaimed when it saw the first Blood Crow King that was left behind hanging on a tree, dead. When its attention was diverted, nine black serpents flew out from the forest and bit into it.

“Not good!” The Blood Crow King tried to struggle, but it was too late. The Black Tortoise Chains dragged the Blood Crow King into the forest, where Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword, activating the glory spirits and releasing his Astral Sword Intent.

The Blood Crow King couldn’t dodge, and its head flew off before it could even comprehend what was happening. A bead fell out from its corpse, which Lin Yun stowed. With that, he obtained two more beads.

“Time to go back!” Lin Yun let go of the Flower Burial Sword to bait the other Blood Crow Kings while absorbing the bead. Not only could the bead temper his martial intent, but the energy contained within it was similar to a beast's core, and refining it could strengthen his cultivation. He was initially at the beginning of seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage, but he now reached close to the pinnacle.
