Chapter 1564 - Identity Revealed

Lin Yun’s words caused a commotion. After all, everyone here knew that he was the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, but he was only at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. Not to mention Nangong Yan, his cultivation was a little too low even when compared to other saint disciples.

Although strength couldn’t be purely determined by cultivation, it was a little special for the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. After all, one star was equivalent to one fold of astral energy, and this advantage was too great.

“Lin Yun, are you insane?” Ye Ziyun was scared when she heard what Lin Yun said. She first looked at him before turning to Ye Ziling, and her feelings were complicated. After all, even Nangong Yan, who was at the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm and had grasped the Firmament Blade Intent, couldn’t defeat this masked man.

So she felt Lin Yun was a little naive, wanting to stand out for Ye Ziling. The masked man had already displayed his strength, and it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that he was invincible at the Elysium Core Realm. Ye Ziyun knew Lin Yun was strong, but Lin Yun was still too young, and she didn’t think Lin Yun could face the masked man right now.

Luo Yuan furrowed his brows when Lin Yun stood out for Ye Ziling. Others might not know, but Luo Yuan knew how famous Lin Yun was recently. After all, he was the direct reason why the Nether Divinity Clan’s patriarch died. If the masked man crippled Lin Yun, he knew that this matter would instantly get out of hand.

Since Ye Ziling taught Liu Xu a lesson earlier and greatly embarrassed the Profound Sky Sect, Luo Yuan only wanted to teach Ye Ziling a lesson and deal a blow to the Sword Sect’s reputation. So he wasn’t willing to provoke Lin Yun.

“She’s responsible for injuring my Profound Sky Sect’s disciple. She doesn’t dare to come out? Or is she only someone who will hide behind a man? It looks like Jian Jingtian’s daughter didn’t inherit his courage!” Luo Yuan sneered.

Ye Ziling’s face changed when she heard that because those words greatly impacted her. She said, “Junior Brother, let me handle this matter. You’re not his opponent.”

“Senior Sister Ye, he’s merely someone who knows how to hide. You don’t have to worry about me, not to mention that I’ve already guessed his true identity.” Lin Yun smiled.

“No way. He’s here for me, and I can’t back down. In the worst situation…” Ye Ziling was firm in her decision. She was the one who injured Liu Xu. So if the Profound Sky Sect wanted to take revenge, she would face it head-on.

“Heavily injured and humiliated in the worst situation?” Lin Yun replied. “Ha, that Liu Xu deserves to die, to begin with. He had already lost and didn’t know how to clean his mouth. If it’s not for the rules of the Heavenly Pool Gathering, I wouldn’t have let him leave this place alive.”

His words made the usually firm Ye Ziling hesitate.

“Let’s not mention that Senior Brother saved my life multiple times. You’re my best friend, and I’m willing to deal with this matter for you. Not to mention that this isn’t anything great.” Lin Yun pushed Ye Ziling aside and flew to the stage.

When the masked man saw Lin Yun descending on the stage, a smile rose on his lips. It was naturally best for him that the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple was willing to fight. If he had to choose anyone to be his stepping stone before entering the Dragon Pulse Realm, Lin Yun was naturally a better choice than Ye Ziling.

Gritting her teeth, Ye Ziling could only remain in a daze, looking at Lin Yun’s silhouette as she backed down. Mu Xueqin, Mu Qingqing, and the others who knew about Lin Yun and Ye Ziling’s close relationship couldn’t help feeling complicated when they saw this scene.

“Lin Yun, you’re too impulsive. You’ve never lost a battle after reaching the Elysium Core Realm. Is it worth giving up your invincible path for a woman?” The masked man looked at Lin Yun as though he understood him far better than anyone else.

“You understand me so well?” Lin Yun smiled.

As surprise flashed across the masked man’s pupils, the masked man replied, “You can still smile? Or do you think you can win or won’t have a terrible outcome even if you lose? I might go easy on others, but I won’t go easy on you.”

Luo Yuan was scared, seeing that the masked man wanted to kill Lin Yun, and quickly transmitted his voice to the masked man, “You want to cripple him? Don’t be impulsive. He’s the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple.”

“This is the reason why I want to cripple him. You don’t have to worry about him. We’re both at the Elysium Core Realm, and the Sword Sect won’t stand out for him.”

When Luo Yuan heard the masked man’s reply, his eyes began to flicker, and he felt that this might be an opportunity.

Looking at the masked man, Lin Yun replied, “I roughly know who you are, and no one is invincible in the world. Even the Nine Emperors have been defeated before, not to mention that you’re not the Nine Emperors. So there’s no way you can be compared to my senior brother.”

The masked man also didn’t want to waste time talking to Lin Yun, since it was already determined that Lin Yun would end up a disabled person when he dared to appear on the stage.

“Lin Yun, everyone says you’re the strongest genius in regards with the sword in the Ancient Barren Domain amongst the younger generation. Today, I’ll use a sword to defeat you and suppress my cultivation to your level. I’ll let you know the meaning of being invincible in the same generation!” Before the masked man finished, he used his fingers as a sword with lightning condensed into a sword shape, then thrust it towards Lin Yun’s chest.

His sword ray contained two martial intents, light and thunder. Aside from that, he also grasped the Firmament Sword Intent, which surprised Lin Yun a little. But Lin Yun’s sword intent had long reached the quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, and the masked man was still far from that.

He only empowered his Firmament Sword Intent with Light and Thunder Intents, which made Lin Yun look at him in a different light. Circulating his mantra, Lin Yun flicked his finger and unleashed a sword ray.

When the two sword rays clashed on the stage, the collision produced a dazzling light, and the explosion echoed. The two maintained where they were as they unleashed more sword rays. In the next second, the entire stage was filled with sword rays flying around.

As thousands of sword rays filled the stage, the colliding sword rays reached a terrifying height. Layers of flowers also appeared behind Lin Yun as they overlapped, and the power was unleashed through the Flicking Divine Finger. On the other hand, behind the masked man was a sea of lightning with a bright sun.

Lin Yun stood on the spot without moving with his azure robe and hair fluttering in the wind. He was like a sword god while activating his sword souls. When he flicked his finger, the sword at the Netherflower’s heart incessantly trembled.

When the sword was pushed to the limit, it flew out from the Netherflower’s heart along with Lin Yun’s sword aura. The next second, the sword soared within Lin Yun’s body and moved to his right hand.

Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword!

When Lin Yun flicked his finger, the Divine Nether Sword flew out and the sea of flowers behind him began to boil. The thousands of swords manifested into corrosive dragons that broke through the layers of lightning toward the masked man.

“Eight thousand!” The masked man was shocked to see so many sword rays were being controlled at once. He instantly knew that Lin Yun’s attainment in the sword had far surpassed him.

“Light!” A decisive light flashed across the masked man’s pupils and the sun above the sea of lightning behind him flew out when he pointed with his fingers. When the sun collided with the Divine Nether Sword, the sun was instantly covered with holes.

“Go!” Lin Yun raised his brow and drew the Flower Burial Sword out before tossing it. He had immediately used the quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. The Flower Burial Sword flying forth was like a layer of heaven flying toward the masked man.

His sword cracked the astral energy around the masked man, but the masked man released a groan as saint light shone from within his body. The Flower Burial Sword was knocked back, so Lin Yun stepped forth and grasped the sword. When he swung his sword, it felt like the sky had collapsed.

The air around the sword's path was cracked, and the masked man felt that heaven was crushing down on him. Without hesitation, the masked man drew out a purple saint sword, rotating a few hundred times in a breath, blocking the Aquaheaven Sword Technique that was unleashed by Lin Yun.

“Sword!”

“Sword!” The two retreated after this clash and simultaneously threw their swords as though they had a rapport. Under the empowerment of various martial intents, the two swords clashed in the air under their control and sparks were flying around.

“Lightning Saint Physique!”

“Azure Dragon Saint Physique!” The two approached using their saint physiques and fist techniques to clash head-on. Ten punches later, the collision between their fists echoed like rumbling thunder. Every punch they threw would leave a crack in the ground. Their punches slowed down in the end, but the shockwaves of their punches grew, and the shockwaves implicated even the surrounding pavilions.

Seeing this, the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord formed a seal, and the surrounding suspending palaces retreated. Another punch later, the barrier enveloping the stage shattered. Without the barrier’s protection, the shockwaves from their punches manifested into a terrifying storm that swept out.

This also caused a commotion amongst the pavilions and everyone was dumbfounded because they didn’t expect the fight between Lin Yun and the masked man to be so intense.

“Sword!”

“Sword!” Lin Yun and the masked man roared as their swords returned to their hands.

But Lin Yun was faster since his rapport with the Flower Burial Sword was something that no one could be compared to. Executing the Heaven Sword Form, his sword shattered the masked man’s sword aura before knocking the latter’s saint sword away.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Even if the masked man was fast, a sword ray still struck his mask. When a fine crack appeared on the ancient mask he was wearing, the mask exploded in the next moment, exposing a handsome face before everyone. When everyone saw the masked man’s actual appearance, they were all dumbfounded.

This was because everyone knew this person. Not only within the Ancient Barren Domain, there wasn’t a single person who didn’t know of this person in the Eastern Desolation.

“This… what’s going on?!” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord’s face changed because he recognized this person. But he didn’t know what this person was doing here.

The masked man’s true identity was the first on the Elysium Core Ranking, Huang Xuanyi!
