Chapter 1054 - My Sword Has Been Waiting!

No one from the war realms could stop Lil’ Red who was enveloped in a violent aura of an ancient beast. Cold light flashed through Lil’ Red’s eyes while black gloss covered its fur. Everyone that met locked eyes with Lil’ Red was plunged into deep fear. It was like they were looking at an ancient beast.

The fear that they felt greatly reduced their fighting prowess. On top of that, the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff that Lil’ Red wielded had an extraordinary origin. In its complete state, the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff was an ancient weapon that was even stronger than dao artifacts.

Who would have thought that Lin Yun’s pet would be so strong? At this moment, the plaza was covered with craters and corpses. The war realms were suffering too much at Lin Yun’s hands.

Many geniuses from the war realms were killed and Wind Mound Plaza was nearly destroyed. There was also the matter of Lin Yun sending the Nether Divinity Realm Son into the ground. Despite his carefree laughter and arrogance, the Nether Divinity Realm Son was blasted into the ground. It was shocking to say the least.

When the Elysium Trigram Realm Son and Profound Dragon Realm Son destroyed Lin Yun’s attack, they had ugly looks on their faces. Lin Yun’s complexion was becoming rosy again, which proved that he was rapidly recovering from exhaustion. It was enough to make their eyes twitch.

They knew how exhausting it was to execute a holy spirit martial technique, so watching Lin Yun recover quickly was infuriating. It was even worse since Lin Yun’s tattered armor started to repair itself.

“This fellow!” The Profound Dragon Realm Son gnashed his teeth as a cold light flashing through his pupils. He realized that Lin Yun was a tough nut to crack. He nearly broke his ribs to destroy Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Armor. In fact, he could still feel pain in his chest from the price he paid.

The Realm Sons realized that they underestimated Lin Yun. The speed of Lin Yun’s recovery had far exceeded their expectations. At this moment, they could sense the terrifying potential contained in Lin Yun’s body. The Elysium Trigram Realm Son said, “He has to die! His potential is too terrifying. Who knows what heights he’ll reach after leaving the Heavenly Path.”

The Profound Dragon Realm Son shared the same thought, so he nodded his head. However, they didn’t look for the Nether Divinity Realm Son as if they weren’t bothered by his death.

As Lil’ Red’s Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff killed another war realm genius, the Realm Sons became more agitated. A mere pet was slaughtering their men, which felt like a slap to the face.

Lin Yun’s eyes twitched as he stepped forward, “You two better stay where you are.”

Lin Yun’s sword intent started to pour out and envelop the Realm Sons. This time, no one dared to look down on Lin Yun’s attack.

“This brat!” Rage filled the eyes of the Realm Sons. A brief moment later, the Elysium Trigram Realm Son looked at Lin Yun and Lil’ Red at the same time. “Lin Yun, it’s impressive that you can force us this far. But you’re offending three war realms!”

Lin Yun heard the words, but he wasn’t bothered. The Realm Sons were stalling for time, but Lin Yun wasn’t worried since Lil’ Red was saving Yue Weiwei. He just needed to hold off the Realm Sons to give Lil’ Red time.

The means of the Realm Sons were terrifying. It was the first time that the crowd had seen them in such a perilous position where they had to remind someone where they were from. Lin Yun, however, wasn’t confident that he could win since killing a Realm Son was difficult.

Lin Yun was certain that the Nether Divinity Realm Son wasn’t dead. At most, his holy spirit was destroyed. So it would be best if Lil’ Red could rescue Yue Weiwei during this period of time.

Suddenly, the sky began to tremble violently as boundless golden radiance shone in the sky. As Lil’ Red swung the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff, a gigantic ape was manifested.

Just like that, the remaining four gold ranking geniuses burst into blood. Although Lin Yun was shocked, he stayed calm and hoped for the best. He hoped that Lil’ Red could force out one of the Realm Son’s trump cards. After all, the Realm Sons didn’t have an endless amount of trump cards.

With Lil’ Red becoming even more arrogant, the Profound Dragon Realm Son’s eyes flashed with decisiveness, “You don’t think that a mere pet can save her, right?”

“Do you beg to differ?” Lin Yun asked.

“You must be dreaming! Dragon Imprisoning Stage!” The Profound Dragon Realm Son roared. When the chains on his wrist began to tremble, nine gigantic shackles suddenly appeared in the region Yue Weiwei was in. Every single shackle was akin to a venomous viper that instantly formed a semi-circle prison.

When the cage was formed, Lil’ Red was knocked backwards. Then, the Profound Dragon Realm Son flicked his finger. The shackle in his hand turned into a black beam of light. The light manifested into a draconic python that charged at Lil’ Red.

Everything took place in the blink of an eye. Clearly, the Realm Sons planned to trap Lin Yun before Lil’ Red caused a scene. Lin Yun’s eyes flashed because he recognized that the Realm Sons had no intention of letting him live.

“Profound Draconic Python!” The crowd was shocked that the Dragon Capturing Shackle of the Realm Son was a Profound Draconic Python.

“Even someone in the sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm wouldn’t be able to break apart the Dragon Imprisoning Stage. Lin Yun, you can give up on saving her and think about saving yourself instead!”

“Time for us to end this game. Nether Divinity Realm Son, aren’t you going to come out? Don’t let others think of us as a laughing stock!” The Elysium Trigram Realm Son barked.

The crowd was stunned. The Nether Divinity Realm Son isn’t dead? Didn’t he crash into a flame vein?

While everyone began contemplating the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s condition, the ground started to gush with flames.

“Oh my god, the Nether Divinity Realm Son isn’t dead!”

“He must have a protection talisman or a similar treasure from his clan. The foundation of a war realm is terrifying. Based on his current aura, he probably brought out all of his strength.” A Realm Son had many methods of protection, so it made sense that the Nether Divinity Realm Son was still alive. After all, the war realms had inheritances that were unimaginable to the Kunlun Realm.

“Lin Yun, no one has ever forced me this far. You’re the first, but you’re also the last!” A powerful aura exploded from the depth of the ground as a beam of light shot out. Under the radiance, the sky turned rainbow as a holy spirit appeared once more. It was shocking that the Nether Divinity Realm Son could use his holy spirit martial technique again.

It was public knowledge that the exhaustion of a holy spirit martial technique was enough to suck someone dry. However, the Nether Divinity Realm Son had broken this logic. Not only did he execute his holy spirit martial technique once more, but the power of his holy spirit was a lot stronger than before.

Under the rainbow radiance, heaven and earth began to tremble violently. Everyone could tell that the Nether Divinity Realm Son was pushing his holy spirit martial technique to a whole new level to suppress Lin Yun.

As the light radiated to an unbelievable level, everyone could sense the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s fury. Clearly, the Nether Divinity Realm Son wanted to wash his humiliation away.

“Lin Yun, kneel!” With a bark, the Nether Divinity Realm Son burst out from the ground with a rainbow phoenix hovering above his head. Shockingly, the Nether Divinity Realm Son had also grasped two holy spirits. Furthermore, the pressure of the rainbow phoenix was a lot stronger than the peacock.

From some distance away, the Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons looked at this scene and sneered coldly. Lin Yun was really naive to think that he had killed the Nether Divinity Realm Son. Clearly, the two Realm Sons knew that the Nether Divinity Realm Son still had this trump card,. It was gifted to him by a senior from his clan. It was extremely precious and could withstand the full attack of an empyrean.

This was the reason why the two of them had been holding off Lin Yun. But in the next second, their smiles froze on their faces as a sword ray descended from the sky, shattering the rainbow radiance into pieces.

Before the Nether Divinity Realm Son could react, the rainbow phoenix above his head shattered. He immediately threw up a mouthful of blood. A sword was brilliantly shining, which made everyone realize that Lin Yun had drawn his sword.

No one had discovered Lin Yun’s movement until his sword was already drawn. Above his head, was a sun and moon. It was Lin Yun’s strongest sword, Solaris Lunar.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son clasped his hands together to catch the sword, but the power of the sword made him kneel. Looking at the Nether Divinity Realm Son from above, Lin Yun spoke coldly, “My sword has been waiting for you for a long time.”

“Lin Yun, you’re taking it too far!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son roared as he threw up blood with every word he spoke. He wanted to release all of his pent up anger, but his humiliation was multiplied instead. He never imagined that he, a Realm Son, would kneel before Lin Yun twice.

“Stop!” The Profound Dragon and Elysium Trigram Realm Sons became nervous as they charged over. Without hesitation, they brought out their holy spirit martial techniques once more and unleashed a boundless pressure.

Just when Lin Yun managed to deal with the Nether Divinity Realm Son, the other Realm Sons charged at him again. A ferocious light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes as he slapped the sword hilt. Instantly, he pierced the Nether Divinity Realm Son into the ground.

Then, the wings behind Lin Yun flapped as he soared into the sky to face the Profound Dragon Realm Son and the Elysium Trigram Realm Son. He wanted to face them to end this game once and for all.
