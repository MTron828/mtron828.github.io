Chapter 128 - Why would I trick you?

Lightning flickered on the peak of the barren mountain that was shrouded by thunderclouds. A long streak of lightning illuminated the murder of Blackflame Crows.

Could it be a thunder elemental demonic beast?

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered with expectation. His Thunderblitz Battle Physique had already reached the third stage. If he wanted to take another step further, he would have to kill a thunder elemental demonic beast that was at least in the seventh orifice and take its beast core.

He could only form the genuine Thunderblitz Battle Physique by combining the beast core and Fiery Demon Battle Physique.

If he could successfully cultivate the Thunderblitz Battle Physique, his strength would greatly increase. Based on his physique alone, he would reach at least fifty thousand catty of strength and his defense would even be able to resist the attack of a seventh orifice cultivator.

“What an immense pressure… It’s already dead, but its aura is still so terrifying!”

“At the very least, the deceased demonic beast must be in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm. It must have a horrifying bloodline.”

“But this murder of Blackflame Crows is troublesome.”

The Xiantian Realm cultivators that were gathered at the foot of the mountain increased. In just a short moment, there were already a few hundred cultivators gathered.

Discussions sounded out as everyone showed great interest in the unknown demonic beast’s corpse. Lin Yun wasn’t the only one interested in it.

Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!

People started to ascend the mountain. When Lin Yun looked around, he could see many cultivators in the surroundings. Just based on the cultivators in the fifth orifice of the Xiantian Realm alone, Lin Yun counted many of them.

“Looks like many people have their attention directed over.” Lin Yun was crestfallen when he saw the number of people. He could imagine how intense the battle would be.

That was the rule in the Azure Sun Realm. Whether it was the treasures or profound cores, only the capable could obtain them. It was impossible to avoid risks and conflicts.

It only took a moment for Lin Yun to decide to take a look. He joined the mountain climbing army with the sword box behind him.

But as they got higher, the pressure increased. Many Xiantian Realm cultivators barely climbed halfway before they gasped for breath.

As for Lin Yun, who possesses the Fiery Demon Battle Physique, it was nothing to him. He was even able to ascend the Heavenly Flame Peak back then. This barren mountain was nothing.

But when he was about to approach the peak, the nearby cultivators all hid and carefully looked out. After spending a few days here in the Azure Sun Realm, everyone had become cautious.

“What a huge demonic beast corpse…”

“It’s a Purple-Lightning Demonic Dracoape!”

“What terrifying aura! It feels so oppressive even though it’s dead!”

Some cultivators exclaimed when they saw this scene.

The corpse is enormous? Lin Yun couldn’t understand why everyone was exaggerating. When he hid and carefully looked out, the mountain top was covered in traces of lightning strikes. There was a massive stone at the top of the mountain. It was a few hundred meters in length and about thirty meters in width.

The stone itself looked like a small hill, but where was the corpse? The baffled Lin Yun suddenly got his answer when the region was illuminated by a bolt of lighting. Lin Yun’s mouth dropped when the lightning flashed.

The small hill wasn’t a hill. It was the Purple-Lightning Demonic Dracoape’s corpse! The black color made it easy to overlook. Thousands of Blackflame Crows hovered above the corpse, pecking at the corpse unhurriedly.

The beak of the Blackflame Crows was sharper than profound artifacts. Even if the Purple-Lightning Demonic Dracoape’s defense was tough, it still couldn’t stop the sharp beaks.

Furthermore, the flames that the Blackflame Crows spat out were corrosive black flames. It didn’t take long for the Purple-Lightning Demonic Dracoape to be shrunk down by the Blackflame Crows.

Rustle!

When the beaks of the Blackflame Crows pierced into the Purple-Lightning Demonic Dracoape’s stomach, a terrifying Profound Martial Realm aura started spreading out.

Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!

On the mountain peak, a few purple bolts descended from the sky.

“Profound Martial Realm!”

“Holy shit! It’s really a Profound Martial Realm demonic beast!”

“This Purple-Lightning Demonic Dracoape must’ve just broken through the seventh orifice of the Martial Realm, but died the moment it broke through the bottleneck.”

“If it can grow up, it can definitely grow into a terrifying demonic beast that transcends the Profound Martial Realm.”

“It must have a profound core!”

Everyone around the peak instantly grew frantic with greed in their eyes. A common profound core could send them into a frenzy. However, the Purple-Lightning Demonic Dracoape possessed an ancient bloodline, so it was more valuable than a common profound core.

Lin Yun also charged forward with the other cultivators. His gaze blazed, but he kept his calm.

He looked at the sharp beaks of the corpse-eating Blackflame Crows. If anyone dared to step up, they would definitely suffer.

“Everyone, let’s go together! They’re just a bunch of crows. Why do we have to be afraid of these birds?!”

They were blinded with greed, tossing the sheer number of crows to the back of their heads. In the next second, a group of cultivators charged at the Purple-Lightning Demonic Dracoape’s corpse. Despite knowing the dangers, they felt that they were the special ones among the masses.

Flap! Flap!

The Blackflame Crows were alarmed by the commotion. Flapping their wings, they clashed with the human cultivators. It didn’t take long for the scene to become chaotic.

Countless Blackflame Crow corpses fell from the sky. The corpses from human cultivators also littered the ground.

Wails and howls sounded out from the battlefield, striking horror into the hearts of whoever heard it. The cultivators were being torn apart and pecked to death by the Blackflame Crows. Every time the Blackflame Crows attacked, they would tear off a piece of flesh from the cultivators. In the brief encounter, many human cultivators had chunks of flesh ripped from their bodies.

“My eyes…”

Lin Yun saw a fourth orifice cultivator get his eye pierced by a Blackflame Crow. But that wasn’t all. Black flames from the crow dashed out and into the wound like an arrow.

Boom!

The flames pierced the eyes and burst out from the back of the head. The fourth orifice cultivator's head exploded.

Flap! Flap! Flap!

The Blackflame Crows began to unleash their ultimate attack. They spit out lumps of corrosive black flames into the crowd, drawing wails and howls from human cultivators. Fear took over everyone and the remaining human cultivators began to retreat.

“Holy shit! I can’t even gain momentum in my fight with those Blackflame Crows. Their beaks pierced everything, even my armor!” yelled one of the cultivators.

“Be happy that you’re still alive. The black flames’ corrosive ability is too strong. It’s impossible to resist those flames with the physique of a Xiantian Realm cultivator!” another cultivator yelled back. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Everyone who fled had lingering fear in their eyes and pale faces. The battle didn’t take long, but the ground was littered with hundreds of corpses, both human cultivators and Blackflame Crows.

However, no one left despite their failures. They did not want to give up so easily. At the same time, the foot of the mountain welcomed another batch of people.

The Blackflame Crows took a heavy blow to their numbers, which gave hope to the human cultivators. It would be enough if they launched another attack, but they couldn’t muster any courage after looking at the pile of corpses on the ground.

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered in deep thought. He did not look at the Blackflame Crows, but his attention was entirely focused on the surrounding cultivators. The human heart was more terrifying than demonic beasts, and three people made him feel fearful.

One was a man donned in black armor that was probably a mid-grade profound artifact. The second one was a middle-aged man dressed in azure clothes, but he had concealed his aura and disguised himself to seem weak. The last was a scrawny old man, whose eyes flickered with wicked thoughts. The first two were in the fifth orifice, while the last was in the sixth orifice.

Lin Yun clearly remembered that the scrawny old man was the one who incited everyone to attack while he stood still, watching how everyone sent themselves to their death.

The scrawny old man was currently looking around at the surrounding cultivators in deep thought.

Caw! Caw! Caw!

While everyone had no idea what to do next, they heard the cries of Blackflame Crows echoing from their surroundings. Lin Yun looked at the source, his face changed at the black patches of Blackflame Crows. The sheer number of crows made him feel a tingling sensation in his scalp.

There were at least three thousand of them!

The Blackflame Crows, who grew dramatically in their numbers, made everyone feel despair.

“This…” Lin Yun soon figured out with his quick thinking. The corpses on the ground must have attracted more Blackflame Crows.

The Blackflame Crows were truly sensitive to the scent of corpses. Shortly after, an unbearable scene unfolded before everyone. The murder of Blackflame Crows dived down, pecking and consuming the corpses on the ground.

“Damn it!”

Looking at the Blackflame Crows defiling the corpses, the human cultivators ground their teeth in anger. But no one dared to move. Instead, they chose to remain in their positions silently. With that, the mountain top welcomed a moment of silence. The only noise that sounded out was from the Blackflame Crows.

Lin Yun looked at the Blackflame Crows and estimated his odds. He wasn’t optimistic because he had just missed the best opportunity earlier. Against a murder of Blackflame Crows, not even a seventh orifice cultivator would dare to face them head-on.

“Lil’ brother, you should be able to last long against the crows by relying on your Fiery Demon Battle Physique, right?” The scrawny old man suddenly spoke; he was looking at Lin Yun with a smile.

“Lin Yun!”

His voice drew attention from the surroundings. When they saw Lin Yun, many people instantly recognized him. After all, the scene of Lin Yun fighting Mei Zihua and Xue Tu outside was deeply etched in their mind. Lin Yun’s strength had won their admiration.

The robust man and middle-aged man were also looking at Lin Yun.

“You’re praising me too much, old sir. I do not dare take the risk when facing so many Blackflame Crows,” replied Lin Yun.

However, the scrawny old man chuckled, “You’re fully capable of leading the party. If you’re willing to lead everyone, I will definitely follow your orders. Even if we have to share the profound core among us, it’s still better than giving it to these filthy crows!”

“Sounds reasonable. If we don’t work together, we can only watch the Blackflame Crows split the profound core among themselves.”

“Sir Lin, your physique is the strongest among us here. Aside from you, I’m afraid that no one is capable of leading everyone.” The middle-aged man spoke out.

“Lead us to take revenge for the deceased!”

“Sir Lin, the position of a leader naturally goes to you!”

“With Sir Lin leading us, I believe that we’ll be able to get rid of those damned crows!”

Everyone started flattering Lin Yun, which made the scrawny old man smile. He was satisfied with the atmosphere that he had created.

Lin Yun sneered. Others might not have noticed, but Lin Yun saw how the old foggy led so many people to their death. Maybe if other hotblooded youths were in his shoes, they might agree to it.

Then again, the scrawny old man’s action also meant that he was starting to get anxious.

When this thought went through Lin Yun’s mind, he cupped his hands together, “Since all of you think highly of me, then I’ll take the honor in leading everyone. But let me rest, for now, no rush.”

The scrawny old man immediately smiled, seeing Lin Yun falling for his scheme. He praised, “What a young hero, Sir Lin. You have my admiration!”

Under his lead, everyone gave their praises to Lin Yun. With a grin, Lin Yun waved his hand, “I dare not claim to be a hero.”

As time passed, Lin Yun would say that the time wasn’t right, no matter how the scrawny old man praised him. Simultaneously, the profound core’s aura was getting denser in the sky.

The old man became anxious when he saw the bones of the Purple-Lightning Demonic Dracoape revealed from the corpse. He turned to look at Lin Yun whose face still had a bright smile.

“Sir Lin, are you not going to lead the team now?” The old man fawned.

Lin Yun still sat down calmly and smiled, “Old Sir, why are you so anxious? How can you do anything great with that temperament? Be like me; learn some patience.”

Lin Yun stared and reprimanded the scrawny old man in public.

“Yes, yes! You’re right, sir.” The old man could only reply with an embarrassed smile.

But when he saw the sly gleam flashing through Lin Yun’s eyes, he immediately figured out that Lin Yun was messing around with him. He roared, “Little bastard, you dare to trick me?!”

“Why would I trick you?” Lin Yun looked at the old man with a playful smile.
