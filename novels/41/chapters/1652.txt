Chapter 1653 – He’s Here! (1)

“That’s a Sovereign Saint Artifact!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Oh my god, that’s a Sovereign Saint Artifact! Isn’t Lin Yun a little too heaven-defying?”

“Wait, this doesn’t make any sense. After all, it’s impossible for him to use an ordinary Sovereign Saint Artifact.”

“Doesn’t he look a little too dashing?”

“Haha! No matter what, it won’t be easy for the Profound Sky Sect to capture Lin Yun now.” A commotion broke out in the surroundings, and they were shocked by this scene. After all, Lin Yun, who was only at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, managed to force a profound life stage’s powerhouse on his knee. Today, the Profound Sky Sect’s prestige was greatly humiliated.

“Damn it!” The face of the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder became red as he knelt on one knee. He couldn’t believe that he was forced down on his knee by a junior, nor did he expect that Lin Yun would use a Sovereign Saint Artifact. If he had been prepared for it, he wouldn’t have fallen for it, even if Lin Yun had taken out his Sovereign Saint Artifact.

“You bastard! How dare you humiliate me! Die!” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder roared and summoned his constellation. When the painting flew out from him, a black serpentine dragon appeared from it, emitting a boundless demonic aura, dying the entire sky black.

When his constellation bloomed, the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder didn’t hold back and relied on his cultivation to bear the pressure from the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella before he slowly got up. A Glory Saint Artifact appeared in his hand when he got back up, a long crimson blade. The blade was shrouded in a demonic aura that looked evil.

“Purgatory Asura Slash!” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder swung his sword, instantly reaching Lin Yun.

When he swung his sword, a terrifying crimson purgatory appeared behind him, and a blade ray from the crimson purgatory lit up the sky. That blade contained all the demonic aura of the asura purgatory, tearing the space apart. Now, he no longer hoped to capture Lin Yun, but wanted to take his life on the spot.

“Junior Brother Lin!” The faces of the Sword Sect’s disciples changed, and they instantly became concerned.

Lin Yun was also surprised by the attack of the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder. Then again, the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder was a Samsara Edict Realm expert. The moment he unleashed his attack, the atmosphere around him changed, and he could sense a faint pressure, even with the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella in his hand. If he didn’t have the umbrella in his hand, he would have probably been slain with a single attack.

But Lin Yun didn’t panic since he had witnessed Jiang Ling personally unleashing the full might of the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. Activating the Blue Dragon Divine Rune within the Blue Dragon Bone, the sun and moon engraved on the umbrella soared into the sky, instantly causing lightning to rumble across the horizon.

In the next moment, Lin Yun wielded the umbrella as if he was breaking apart the thirty-six layers of heaven. As the sky changed, Lin Yun was clearly within reach of the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder, but the distance between them felt like there was an entire universe between them.

As the sun and moon revolved, faint fluctuations and distortions appeared within the surrounding space. Lin Yun was clearly right before the elder, but his blade couldn’t reach Lin Yun no matter how he tried, and the distance between them kept extending. With an infinite space between them, the attack of the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder gradually ran out of energy.

“How is this possible?!” The face of the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder changed when he saw this scene.

“Close!” Seeing that the power in the attack of the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder had run out, Lin Yun closed the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. Despite the infinite distance between them, Lin Yun took a step forth. His umbrella was like a mountain as it crashed down on the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder.

On the other hand, the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder felt like his entire world was spinning. In the end, he threw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away.

“Go!” With a flick of his wrist, the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella was like a sharp sword streaking towards the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder.

Before the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder landed on the ground, he quickly raised his blade to resist the umbrella’s attack. But the force behind the umbrella still pushed him back.

Just when Lin Yun was going to take another step forth, an immense shadow enveloped him, and the tremendous pressure instantly made him feel like he was carrying a mountain on his back, making it challenging for him to walk. When he raised his head, he saw the black serpentine dragon, the constellation of the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder.

“A mere serpentine dragon dares to act with such impudence before me?!” Lin Yun’s hands were joined together and fully circulated his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent while he retreated. Empowered by the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, Lin Yun unleashed Dragon-Phoenix Sword Auras from within his body as he fled.

In a split second, the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Auras formed into millions of swords that shot towards the serpentine dragon. As sparks flew, the serpentine dragon screamed out in pain, unable to get close to Lin Yun while being under the barrage of swords.

Blue Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal, Silver Dragon Seal, and the Sovereign Dragon Seal.

When his hands joined together, Lin Yun suddenly stopped retreating with three flames blazing within his pupils.

Divine Dragon Eyes!

When Lin Yun spread his hands apart, he raised his head to see the serpentine dragon do its best while wanting to descend. As the black serpentine dragon’s head hovered over him, five paintings unfolded behind him.

Just like that, Lin Yun briefly fought with the dragon before the black serpentine dragon finally crumbled. With the constellations of five ominous beasts, in addition to his Blue Dragon Bone, Azure Dragon Saint Physique, and Divine Dragon Eyes, he easily shattered the constellation of the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder. When Lin Yun’s hands joined together, he took a deep breath to stop himself from throwing out blood.
