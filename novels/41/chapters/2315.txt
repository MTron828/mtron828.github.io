Chapter 2316 - One Year, Too Long

Seven days passed, and the trip to the Heavenly Barren Realm was starting. Half of the universe was in an uproar outside the Kunlun Realm, with many geniuses preparing for it. But this uproar had nothing to do with the Kunlun Realm.

Ever since the Heavenly Path was severed, few from the Kunlun Realm would participate in such a grand event. As more Lesser Blue Dragon Medals were being used and the rarity of divine flame fragments, only a few people paid any attention to it anymore. Even if they knew, they would only find it a pity because they didn’t have a Lesser Blue Dragon Medal or divine flame fragment.

But the Divine Phoenix Mountain was bustling, with everyone preparing for the Heavenly Barren Realm, including the holy master, to ensure the teleportation array could be activated.

In the Stream Cloud Residence, Lin Yun spent his time cultivating and making a breakthrough, reaching the pinnacle of the fourth-stage Saint Lord. He was only half a step from becoming a fifth-stage Saint Lord.

Aside from that, he focused all his attention on Nirvana Dao and Divine Firefly Sword. The third section had thirteen swords, and it wasn’t tough for Lin Yun to practice them since he had grasped the Nirvana Dao, quickly reaching complete mastery, and was only one step from the manifestation stage.

When he finished his seclusion, he emerged from the Iris Secret Realm.

“You’re finally out,” Lil’ Purple smiled when she saw Lin Yun. It had been some time since she saw him after their last talk. Lin Yun was in seclusion, while Lil’ Purple had to refine the Sinful Fire Divine Rune and couldn’t stay in the Iris Secret Realm.

"It has been a long time since we last met, and you’ve gotten more beautiful," Lin Yun smiled. He was serious because her temperament became even more outstanding whenever Lil’ Purple gathered more Sovereign Divine Runes. Since she had been refining the Sinful Fire Divine Rune during this period, her hair had grown, and she no longer looked like a little girl.

“Hmph, you and your flowery words,” Lil’ Purple smiled, looking at Lin Yun. She had been worried for him during this period, but she also noticed that she had grown taller.

“I’m being honest,” Lin Yun said sincerely.

Lil’ Purple was happy to be praised, looking a little bashful, then she asked, “Are you serious?”

“I am serious,” Li Yun smiled.

“Hmph, at least you have some eyesight. But you won’t bring the Iris Sword Box with you this time, it will stay with me.” Lil’ Purple waved her hand and summoned the Iris Sword Box to her.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Lin Yun’s face became grave when he heard that, since he knew what that meant. This meant that Lil’ Purple would bear the responsibility of his master’s tribulation to ensure he had no regrets.

In the past, he felt that Lil’ Purple was too narrow-minded. But thinking about it again, she had never refused his decision throughout the years. Despite what she said, she would help him in everything he did. Even if she had complained, she would only complain to Lin Yun and didn’t care about herself. Thinking about it now, there were several requests that Lil’ Purple made that Lin Yun didn’t follow.

Seeing this, Lil’ Purple said with disdain, “Leave quickly. The holy master is waiting for you.”

“If I can return alive, I’ll promise whatever request you make,” Lin Yun said.

“Really?” Lil’ Purple smiled with her eyes shining brightly.

“Yeah,” Li Yun nodded.

“Listen well. Even if you can’t return, you must live well because I will wait for you!” Lil’ Purple said.

When Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple looked at each other, Lin Yun couldn’t help being momentarily dazed. A brief moment later, he replied, “I promise you.”

After leaving the Stream Cloud Residence, Li Yun met the holy master.

“I heard that you’ve been in seclusion in this period. How is your cultivation?” The holy master smiled.

“Not bad,” Lin Yun roughly explained the fruit of his cultivation.

“You’re practically invincible in the same generation in the Kunlun Realm, even if you include geniuses from the Eight Imperial Clans!” The holy master briefly paused, then continued, “But I’m afraid that it will still be dangerous for you in the Heavenly Barren Realm.”

“You don’t have to be worried about it. I know what to do, and I’m a low-profile person,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Do you think I’ll believe you? Speaking of which, how far have you gone with the Divine Light Sword Intent?” The holy master asked.

“Pinnacle of complete mastery,” Lin Yun smiled.

With the improvement of Nirvana Dao, cultivation, and comprehension outside the God Burial Mountain Range, Lin Yun’s Divine Light Sword Intent reached the pinnacle of complete mastery.

The holy master was inwardly shocked but calmly said, “How far are you to reach the Bright Sun Sword Intent?”

“Nothing for now,” Lin Yun shook his head. The sword intent had a total of nine stages: the Xiantian Sword Intent, Spiritual Sword Intent, Sky Sword Intent, Firmament Sword Intent, Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, Astral Sword Intent, and the Divine Light Sword Intent. Above the Divine Light Sword Intent would be the Bright Sun Sword Intent.

“There’s no need to hurry. The Divine Light Sword Intent is already powerful enough against the entire universe. Even in the Heavenly Barren Realm, you can rely on your Divine Light Sword Intent,” the holy master said.

“Thank you for your praise, Holy Master,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Do you have any requests?” The holy master asked.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, since he was waiting for that. He smiled, “I still need some divine dragon saint liquid… Then again, divine blood would be best.”

“I’ve been waiting for you to make a request. You can go to the Phoenix Pavilion and take whatever you need,” the holy master smiled.

“Thank you, Holy Master,” Lin Yun smiled.

Since the holy master wanted him to go with Ji Zixi, he naturally wouldn’t be stingy with resources. If Lin Yun could ensure Ji Zixi’s safety, all the resources they had were nothing. Not to mention that the holy master wouldn’t refuse Lin Yun’s request, based on his relationship with Lil’ Purple.

Three days later, many Saints had gathered together to send Ji Zixi and Lin Yun off.

“Be careful,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Don’t worry about it.” Lin Yun gave her a wink.

“Go and look after Ji Zixi. She’s the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden now, so you must protect her well,” Lil’ Purple nodded.

Lin Yun headed over to Ji Zixi’s direction. Ji Zixi was resting with her eyes closed while invisible flames ignited around her, forming a terrifying field—the spiritual energy in the surroundings coiled around her under a certain rhythm that made her look noble.

“Big Brother Lin.” Ji Zixi opened her eyes and walked over to Lin Yun. She smiled, “I’ll have to trouble Big Brother Lin to take care of me on this trip to the Heavenly Barren Realm.”

Her bright smile made her look as beautiful as a fairy.

“I’ll have to trouble you, Flower Burial.” The holy master cupped his fists with the other Saints from Divine Phoenix Mountain, with their voices echoing from the summit.

Lin Yun only nodded with a smile before heading towards the teleportation array with Ji Zixi. The altar was altered into a massive teleportation array with the divine flame fragment blazing on the altar, forming a door. This was the teleportation array to the Heavenly Barren Realm, which consumed a divine flame fragment each time.

When the teleportation array was activated, Lin Yun exchanged a gaze with Ji Zixi as they held hands before the door. Upon stepping into the teleportation array, Lin Yun swiftly lost consciousness.

At the same time, there was a similar altar with a divine flame fragment blazing in the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. Yue Weiwei glanced at Mu Xueling before entering the teleportation array. She would be going to the Heavenly Barren Realm as well.

When Lin Yun regained consciousness, he landed on the ground and looked around. This was a mysterious world that looked no different from the Kunlun Realm.

Ji Zixi stood on Lin Yun’s left with a pale expression but was fine. This made Lin Yun heave a sigh in relief since they were at least together. When they looked at the sky, they could see streaks of light descending from different places.

“Zixi,” Lin Yun called out. This place was safe for now, but they couldn’t remain there for long and had to leave immediately, even if Ji Zixi hadn't recovered.

“Big Brother Lin, I’m fine aside from feeling a little dizzy,” Ji Zixi smiled.

“It’s normal to feel a little dizzy when we transport god-knows how far,” Lin Yun smiled.

Ji Zixi nodded, feeling only a little dizzy. Lin Yun also possessed a divine physique, but he looked fine. Ji Zixi couldn’t even unleash half of her strength.

“Let’s leave this place,” Lin Yun said as he looked around. He could see many streaks of light descending in the surrounding area. The Flower Burial Sword flew out from his chest and he grabbed Ji Zixi before jumping onto the sword, using his sword intent to move swiftly, streaking across the sky.

“This place is filled with saint dao, even the heavens and earth look much bigger.” Lin Yun looked around on the Flower Burial Sword and realized that he didn’t feel restricted like in the Kunlun Realm. He felt unrestrained in the Heavenly Barren Realm.

“This place is pretty good, and I feel that my divine physique is changing. I’m afraid I can become a Saint Sovereign within one year.” Ji Zixi also felt unrestricted. “The Heavenly Path is severed in the Kunlun Realm, so everyone cultivates with a shackle. But it’s different after leaving the Kunlun Realm.”

“A Saint Sovereign within one year, keep a low profile like me,” Lin Yun smiled.

Ji Zixi merely smiled and nodded. She couldn’t figure out when Lin Yun was low profile.

“A year is too long, half a year at most,” Lin Yun smiled as he looked ahead. Ji Zixi blinked and couldn’t comprehend how ‘low profile’ that was.
