Chapter 2047 - Martial Brothers

Lin Yun followed Ye Ziling, passing through several streets, before following her to a courtyard. This courtyard was equivalent to a manor and was strictly guarded.

When Ye Ziling walked into the courtyard, the guards responsible for the courtyard’s security cupped their fists together. Lin Yun watched this from afar and guessed that this must be Sword Sect’s residence.

I wonder who’s the one leading the Sword Sect’s party. Lin Yun inwardly muttered, curious about why the Sword Sect wanted to participate in this Sword Assembly. After the Sword Sect fell from a holy land’s position, the gap between them and other sword dao holy lands had increased. So it was hard for the Sword Sect to achieve any results during the Sword Assembly.

This place wasn’t easy to get into. So Lin Yun briefly pondered before stepping forth and taking out the saint disciple’s medal.

“Heavenly Dao Sect’s Ye Qingtian is here to pay the Sword Sect’s representatives a visit,” Lin Yun immediately revealed his identity.

“Ye Qingtian?” When the guards heard what Lin Yun said, they examined the medal and were shocked. This was because Ye Qingtian had become an influential figure and was publicly known as a genius swordsman within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“That’s me,” Lin Yun smiled. He asked, “Who’s leading the Sword Sect’s party this time?”

“The Divine Firmament Peak’s Peak Master, Mu Chuan,” the guard replied.

Lin Yun briefly pondered before saying, “I wish to visit him. Can you guys inform him about my arrival?”

“Okay,” the guards said, asking Lin Yun to briefly wait. It didn’t take long for someone to lead Lin Yun into the courtyard.

There weren’t many people in the courtyard, and he couldn’t find any acquaintances amongst the Sword Sect’s party. He was led through a corridor and entered a pavilion that was at the manor's center. When Lin Yun walked in, the first thing he saw was Mu Chuan reading a book.

Lin Yun was emotional in his heart, but he stepped forth and cupped his fists together. But before he could speak, Mu Chuan’s wrist shook and nether energy formed into a petal that dashed over.

This alarmed Lin Yun, before gathering nether energy into his palm and held onto the petal with his fingers.

“It’s really you, Junior Brother,” Mu Chuan smiled.

“Third Senior Brother,” Lin Yun smiled.

Mu Chuan was surprised that Ye Qingtian would suddenly come to visit him. But when he recalled Ye Guhan’s arrangements, he immediately came to his senses and wanted to probe Ye Qingtian’s identity.

Mu Chuan had reached the Quasi-Saint Realm and was stronger than many of the Quasi-Saints that Lin Yun had seen. He should be on the same level as the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint and was only one step away from the Saint Realm. But this path wasn’t easy to cross.

“Your nether energy is already catching up to me, and you’ve improved greatly throughout the years. I’ve heard that you’ve even grasped the Astral Sword Intent,” Mu Chuan smiled. He was happy to see Lin Yun and Lin Yun’s strength had given him a great surprise.

Lin Yun smiled and said, “Senior Brother, how’s the recent situation?”

Since the two of them had a good relationship, they naturally had much to discuss. Lin Yun wanted to know about his master and the Sword Sect’s situation, and no one was more suitable to ask than Mu Chuan.

“Master seldom comes out now, and I’ve only seen Master once when I reached the Quasi-Saint Realm. Master seems to be in a better situation than others have imagined,” Mu Chuan said with a smile. “But Master’s cultivation has reached a critical point, and he must make it through the tribulation within one year and reach the Emperor Realm that many people can only dream of. This is an opportunity for our master. Who knows how long he has been waiting for this day. Regardless of the outcome, I believe he’ll have no regrets.”

Lin Yun frowned and asked, “I’m not worried if Master just has to face the tribulation, because I know our master won’t have any regrets, even if he fails. But Tian Xuanzi won’t let our master make it through the tribulation so easily. He’s endured for so long and doesn't want to see our master making it through the tribulation.”

Mu Chuan’s smile disappeared, and he couldn’t help feeling helpless when Tian Xuanzi was mentioned. Tian Xuanzi was like Damocles' sword hanging on the Sword Sect’s head. After briefly pondering, Mu Chuan said, “Junior Brother, you don’t have to think too much about it. You’re the one who can inherit our master’s mantle. If our master fails, you must hold yourself back and not be reckless.”

“Why me?” Lin Yun asked. “Can’t Senior Brother Jian Jingtian take over the mantle, instead?”

Mu Chuan shook his head and said, “He was imprisoned for nearly two decades. Even if he’s a King now and invincible beneath the Saint Realm, taking that step out is too hard.”

“What about our eldest senior brother? Senior Brother is a Saint Sovereign, and he might become a Great Saint within ten years,” Lin Yun said.

“He’s troubled by love. If it’s not resolved, he can easily become a Great Saint, but it won’t be easy for him to reach the Emperor Realm,” Mu Chuan said, shaking his head. “As for everyone else, your senior brother Feng Jue is a late bloomer, and who knows how long it will take him.”

“Don’t we still have a second senior sister? Second Senior Sister is also a genius,” Lin Yun asked.

“Do you know who your second senior sister is?” Mu Chuan asked with a playful smile.

“I don’t,” Lin Yun replied. “But she must be a genius.”

“Well…” Mu Chuan smiled bitterly and continued, “Your second senior sister’s situation is complicated, and she can’t take over our master’s mantle. Only you can inherit our master’s mantle. Master once told me that he doesn’t wish us to become the second Radiant Sword Saint. He wants his disciples to surpass the Radiant Sword Saint, and only you can surpass him.”

The Radiant Sword Saint did tell Lin Yun about that before.

“You have to perform well at this Sword Assembly and not embarrass our master,” Mu Chuan continued.

Lin Yun had already decided, but Mu Chuan’s words further fortified his determination. Not only did he want to become first at this Sword Assembly, but he also wanted to obtain the Cauldron Sword.

“Have you seen Ye Ziling?” Mu Chuan asked.

“I’ve seen her, but she didn’t see me,” Lin Yun nodded.

“Did you know that she nearly went insane when she heard what happened to you?” Mu Chuan frowned. “After you left, she has been training crazily and has become the strongest amongst the younger generation. But…”

When hearing that, Lin Yun’s heart clenched, and he asked, “But what?”

“That lass is a little too obsessed. She only has the sword in her heart,” Mu Chuan sighed. “I didn’t know when you left behind a love debt, but she’s working hard because of you.”

Lin Yun felt complicated. Ye Ziling wasn’t as carefree as she looked on the surface. She had buried her feelings deeply and didn’t want others to know about them. To a certain degree, Ye Ziling’s personality was similar to his. They both had their pride and wouldn’t bow their heads so easily.

“Do you want to tell her about your identity?” Mu Chuan asked. “I believe she’ll be happy if she knows your identity. At the very least, she won’t be as self-enclosed as she is now.”

Lin Yun didn’t say a word because it wouldn’t benefit him to tell her about his identity now.

“I’ll let her look at you,” Mu Chuan said.

It didn’t take long for Ye Ziling to arrive. When she arrived, she cupped her fists together, “Peak Master, is there a reason why you wanted to see me?”

Mu Chuan smiled, “Ziling, this is Heavenly Dao Sect’s Ye Qingtian. I’m acquainted with the Indigo Thunder Peak Master, and he also came to see you when he came here to visit me.”

But Ye Ziling was indifferent as she said, “Peak Master, there’s no need to introduce him. I know he’s a genius swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect, and that he has recently killed Jin Xuanyi, becoming first on the King Ranking. But there’s nothing for me to see because he’s just a lecher.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling awkward upon hearing that, but he could do nothing about it. Ye Qingtian’s reputation had already spread throughout the Eastern Desolation before he defeated Jin Xuanyi. But his good deeds weren’t remembered by many. On the contrary, his bad reputation spread like wildfire, leaving a deep impression on everyone.

“Ziling, since you’re here in Nether Ethereal City, you must interact with the younger generation. The disciple of the Ice Emperor has a pretty good temper,” Mu Chuan said. “Ye Qingtian might have an unbearable past, but he has changed. Youngsters should interact more often to benefit your cultivation.”

But Ye Ziling had no change on her face and said, “Peak Master, I have no intentions of going out. I’ll stay in the courtyard before the beginning of the Sword Assembly.”

Mu Chuan bitterly smiled when he heard that.

“Ye Ziling, I know why you don’t dare to go out. You’re afraid of being entangled by people, so you want to hide in the courtyard,” Lin Yun said. “The moment a swordsman has fear planted in their hearts, they will lose their edge, and your sword will become blunt this way.”

Ye Ziling raised her brow and coldly said, “Why don’t we have a spar, then? I’ve heard that you’ve grasped the Astral Sword Intent, which is a great opportunity for me to experience it.”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Lin Yun understood Ye Ziling’s personality well and knew she had fallen for his trap. He mocked, “You’re not my opponent. So don’t embarrass yourself.”

As a cold light shone from Ye Ziling’s pupils, Lin Yun said, “You don’t have to look at me in this manner. I’m merely speaking the truth. If I had faced Gu Zijing, I wouldn’t have backed off. So what if he has an ice bird pulling the carriage, not even that can take a sword of mine.”

“You followed me!” Ye Ziling’s face sank.

“I didn’t follow you; I just coincidentally happened to be there. You don’t have to argue. Your sword is still sharp, but your heart has become rusty,” Lin Yun said. He smiled and left, “Someone like you won’t have any performance at the Sword Assembly, and there’s nothing impressive about the Frost Divine Dragon.”

“Stop right there!” Ye Ziling ran out when Lin Yun came out of the pavilion. While coldly looking at Lin Yun, she said, “Ye Qingtian, do you know how foul your reputation is within the Eastern Desolation?”

“I naturally do, but it doesn’t matter,” Lin Yun replied, biting the bullet.

“Good. Follow me, if you don’t care,” Ye Ziling glanced at Lin Yun and left the courtyard.

Lin Yun’s face changed because he initially wanted to trick her into strolling with him. But it appears that he was the one tricked by her instead. He took a deep breath and asked, “Where are we going?”

“You’ll know when we get there,” Ye Ziling said.

Lin Yun felt helpless but could only follow behind Ye Ziling.
