Chapter 833 - Fireflies’ Light, Radiating the Horizon!

Zhao Wuji suddenly loosened his grip on his blade and turned around to clamp onto Lin Yun’s sword with his two fingers. This scene left everyone shocked. However, Zhao Wuji wasn’t done. Lightning began to flicker on his left hand as he caught Autumn Voice in midair. Then, he tried to stab Lin Yun with his blade.

In response, Lin Yun also held onto Zhao Wuji’s blade with two fingers. The sequence of events happened too fast for anyone to comprehend. In that split second, Zhao Wuji and Lin Yun had competed with their intelligence. This meant that the outcome would have been determined if one of them performed weaker.

Lin Yun noticed that he couldn’t push his sword any further once Zhao Wuji grabbed it, so he quickly retracted it. With a spread of his arms, he moved over 1,000 meters away.

“Overlord Sword–Thunderbolt Slash!” In the next second, Lin Yun charged over at an even faster speed towards Zhao Wuji.

“Break!” Without any change on his face, Zhao Wuji circulated his thundercloud intent to turn the tables around.

However, this was his flaw. Although he managed to withstand one round of Lin Yun’s attacks, Lin Yun wouldn’t stop. Before Zhao Wuji could unleash his attack, Lin Yun’s sword destroyed the attack and stabbed Zhao Wuji.

Zhao Wuji flickered with lightning as Flower Burial stabbed his body by half an inch.

“Get lost!” Zhao Wuji roared as he swung his blade at Lin Yun’s chest.

Retracting his sword, Lin Yun flicked his wrist and sealed off Zhao Wuji’s attack before it was unleashed. As a collision rang out on the stage, Lin Yun was sent flying out as his face turned pale. However, it was clear for all to see that Zhao Wuji was in an even more disadvantageous position because there was blood on his chest.

“He’s injured! Zhao Wuji is injured! H-how did Lin Yun manage to do it?” Many spectators were shocked because they couldn’t understand what happened. The only thing they saw was Lin Yun flying out while Zhao Wuji was injured. Naturally, they thought that Zhao Wuji was stronger than Lin Yun as one of the three kings, especially since he didn’t reveal the fact that he was also proficient in using blades. So who would have thought that Lin Yun would win the exchange?

“You won’t have any more opportunities.” Zhao Wuji’s face sank because he never expected that Lin Yun was so good at finding his flaws. These were flaws that he himself didn’t even know about. So before he knew it, he was fighting for his life. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

No longer holding back, Zhao Wuji revealed his terrifying cultivation in the pinnacle quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. In that split second, his terrifying aura swept out and was double the strength of Jiang Ziye.

As lightning rumbled in the clouds, Zhao Wuji’s blade made a ferocious dragon roar. Then, murderous aura spread across the stage.

Lin Yun pushed the Seven Profound Steps to the limit and avoided the incoming attack. The Flower Burial Sword in his hand also stabbed out like a dragon. He kept his defences tight against Zhao Wuji’s attacks.

In the blink of an eye, they exchanged over a dozen moves. Since Zhao Wuji wasn’t holding back, he clearly held the advantage. After all, Lin Yun’s foundation was a lot weaker despite the fact that he was also in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm.

“There’s no way you can win purely by defending.” Lin Yun’s defences were still very tight, but Zhao Wuji wasn’t in a hurry. In terms of patience, he was confident that he was more patient than anyone else.

“Thundercloud Explosion!” Zhao Wuji unleashed one of his strongest attacks. This time, however, the vortex was combined with his saber intent.

Seeing Zhao Wuji’s attack, Lin Yun could sense his movement technique was being suppressed. Although his speed dropped, he didn’t panic. Instead, he doubled his efforts and stabbed at Zhao Wuji once more. This time, his sword intent began to gather with the combination of his sword and dragon aura.

As an azure dragon roared, Lin Yun’s sword pierced through the air and collided with the thundercloud vortex. Instantly, an explosion of lighting filled the sky. The ground trembled from the impact, showing just how terrifying Lin Yun’s sword was.

Zhao Wuji was stunned. He had observed Lin Yun fight several times already, and logically speaking, Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Aura shouldn’t be so terrifying. It was weird that Lin Yun could break his Thundercloud Explosion with just one sword.

He made a breakthrough again? Zhao Wuji’s face gradually turned grave. Circulating the Thundercloud Art, he roared, “This is something I initially prepared for Yan Long’zi, but since he’s dead, you can have it on his behalf! Thundercloud Battle Physique!”

There were rumours that upon reaching a high level in the Thundercloud Art, one could ignite their vitality to strengthen their physique. This would make the person’s origin energy even more refined.

Zhao Wuji’s aura began to rise violently and he soon broke through the restriction of the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. Although he wasn’t a true Heavenly Soul Realm expert at this moment, his aura was a lot more terrifying than many Heavenly Soul Realm experts.

There were many elders who saw this scene and they were dumbfounded because there didn’t seem to be a limit to Zhao Wuji’s trump cards. They didn’t expect that Zhao Wuji would be so terrifying after unleashing his full power.

“Thundercloud Mountainbreaker!” With a huge surge of his strength, Zhao Wuji soared into the sky and held onto his blade with both his hands. The thunderclouds in the sky began to dance as lightning descended and enveloped Zhao Wuji’s blade.

In just a few seconds, his blade ray ignited and enveloped the entire stage. At this moment, Zhao Wuji looked like a deity with his new aura. When his blade descended, the lightning spread out like tentacles.

The crowd gasped because Zhao Wuji’s attack was too terrifying. The thunderclouds had perfectly fused with his attack to create a silver waterfall that left nowhere for Lin Yun to go.

Everyone from the Great Qin Empire started to worry because Zhao Wuji was too terrifying. Of course, they knew that the banquet was dangerous and they were already happy with Lin Yun’s performance. After all, his ranking would bring great fortune to the Sword Firmament Pavilion. So, they didn’t need Lin Yun to keep fighting and they just hoped he would survive until the end of the banquet.

“Damn it, why is that bastard so terrifying?” Feng Ye cursed anxiously because the three kings were really terrifying.

As for Yue Weiwei, she looked calm because she knew that Lin Yun could withstand this attack. She believed in him, but her clenched fists revealed that even she felt anxious.

Raising his head to look at the blade ray, Lin Yun was surprised by the powerful attack. However, all he felt was surprise. Twirling in the air, Lin Yun gathered all of the sword aura that was on the stage. Then, the boundless Azure Dragon Sword Aura around him turned into an azure dragon.

Lin Yun’s sword began to spin and looked a lot slower than before. Additionally, sparks began to fly out and eventually created a plot of flames.

Zhao Wuji looked at Lin Yun with indifference in his eyes as he spoke, “It’s futile. Aside from Yu Haotian, no one can stop this attack once I bring it out. My Thundercloud Battle Physique is undefeatable!”

Zhao Wuji’s words were cold like ice and caused many people to feel a chill in their hearts. Suddenly, a shocking scene appeared as boundless fireflies began to spread out around Lin Yun.

As his terrifying sword intent hummed, the swords of the spectators began to fly into the sky. Just like that, tens of thousands of swords danced through the sky and started to buzz.

“Quasi-Spiritual Sword Intent!” Everyone was shocked by this scene as they looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. Even Mu Han who also grasped the quasi-spiritual sword intent was dumbfounded. He could sense that Lin Yun’s sword intent was a lot stronger than his as it had practically enveloped the entire stage. Mu Han also noticed that Lin Yun’s sword intent looked like bright stars flickering in the sky.

Under this sword intent, the azure dragon around Lin Yun also became more refined. As flames blazed in the azure dragon’s pupils, the horizon became strikingly bright.
