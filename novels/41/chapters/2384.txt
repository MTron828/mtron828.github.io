Chapter 2385 - Qilin Sword Immortal

Lin Yun wore a smile with unconcealable shock and joy in his eyes. Ji Zixi was also stumped before her gaze became complicated upon recognizing the person in the pavilion, Yue Weiwei.

Ji Zixi was shocked beneath her veil because she never expected Yue Weiwei to be here. She naturally knew this woman’s relationship with Lin Yun, and she even kissed Lin Yun on purpose back when they first met, which had a significant impact since she was still young. Back then, she was furious and bashful, but she never expected that her relationship with Lin Yun would increase, nor that Lin Yun would be deeply engraved in her heart.

“Young Master Lin, you know her?” Lin Jiangxian asked curiously.

When Lin Yun wanted to reply, Xi Yuan smiled, “Lady Lin must be joking. How can Young Master Lin possibly know her?”

Ji Zixi was surprised, and Lin Yun was shocked, wondering if he had recognized the wrong person. He asked, “Lady Xi Yuan, what do you mean?”

Xi Yuan smiled, “She’s the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden and from the Heavenly Demon Clan. She came from the third testing ground, and she caused an uproar when she arrived at Heaven’s Gate a few days ago. Many people wanted to look at her face, and no words could describe her. I might be a woman, but I must admit her beauty, and I couldn't believe there’s such a fascinating woman like her in the world.”

As Xi Yuan spoke, her eyes were filled with admiration but no hint of jealousy. She looked at Lin Jiangxian, and smiled, “All the geniuses who wanted to go to the banquet with her were rejected. A few days ago, even the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was rejected... Even so, many geniuses would stand and look at her whenever she appeared. So how can Young Master Lin possibly know someone like her?”

Lin Jiangxian awkwardly smiled as she looked at Lin Yun. She believed in Lin Yun, and it was rare for him to show his emotions. Even if this Heavenly Demon Clan’s divine maiden was breathtaking, she believed that Lin Yun wouldn’t show such shock on his face, so this only meant that they were acquainted.

Lin Yun smiled and asked, “When did she arrive?”

“Five days ago. She has been playing the zither since she was here, and she is proficient in music dao. That zither is also extraordinary,” Xi Yuan said.

“That’s the Thunderstorm Zither,” Lin Yun said.

“You don’t even know her, so how do you know it’s the Thunderstorm Zither?” Xi Yuan asked.

Lin Yun merely smiled and said nothing. How could he not know when the Thunderstorm Zither was given to her by him? Then again, what was Yue Weiwei doing in Heaven’s Gate? Was it because of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain?

Many thoughts flashed in Lin Yun’s mind, but he had more joy seeing Yue Weiwei than doubt. As for the doubts, he could just ask her later.

“Big Brother Lin, she’s...?” Ji Zixi turned to look at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun merely nodded and said nothing.

“What are you two playing at?” Lin Jiangxian smiled.

“I’ll tell you about it later.” Lin Yun gave Lin Jiangxian a wink.

Xi Yuan fell into deep thoughts, and she began to find it ridiculous because it looked like Lin Yun knew the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden. But how was that possible? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Right then, the zither stopped as a group walked towards that woman. When she turned around, Lin Jiangxian was shocked by Yue Weiwei’s beauty because it was the opposite of Ji Zixi. If Ji Zixi was noble and innocent, Yue Weiwei would be fascinating and charming. She couldn’t help praising, “She’s gorgeous, and I would probably fall for her if I were a man.”

“The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son is here again! He’s probably here to invite her as his companion again,” Xi Yuan exclaimed.

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was a genius of Qilin Mountain, and Qilin Mountain was a powerful force in the three thousand realms, comparable to the Dao Sect. The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was a deity’s descendant from Qilin Mountain, looking elegant and noble.

Even the many geniuses here couldn’t be compared to him in terms of temperament, and many women in the Heavenly Saint Courtyard treated him as their dream lover, such as Xi Yuan. When the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son appeared, Xi Yuan looked at him with envy and crush.

There were many geniuses with the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, and the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son looked confident as he walked at the front.

“Lady Yue, you have rejected me three times. Are you going to refuse me again?” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s eyes shone brightly. His face would make countless women insane, and no woman would refuse him.

Yue Weiwei carried the Thunderstorm Zither as she looked around as though she was looking for someone. She already knew of the ninth testing ground, and she knew that Lin Yun would come. Hence, she had been waiting for him here, but she couldn’t see him anywhere. This made her a little disappointed, but she knew that it was only a matter of time for them to meet again.

“Lady Yue is looking for someone?” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son smiled. “I can help you look around.”

Yue Weiwei smiled but said nothing. Her smile was so charming that it even left ripples in the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s heart.

“I am looking for someone, but I don’t need to trouble you. I have already said many times that I have a companion, and I’m waiting for him,” Yue Weiwei smiled, maintaining their distance.

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son wasn’t bothered by that and considered it an excuse. Right then, a piece of flute music made Yue Weiwei’s face change as she turned her head in that direction, seeing a swordsman looking at her as he played the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute with a smile.

Yue Weiwei was briefly stunned before she rejoiced. She looked at the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, and said, “Please excuse me. The person I have been waiting for has arrived, so I will take my leave first.”

She carried the Thunderstorm Zither and left.

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s face changed along with the surrounding geniuses. The Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden was actually waiting for someone. How is that possible?

“Let me see who you’ve been waiting for!” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son rushed over.

Yue Weiwei landed a hundred meters away from Lin Yun. When they looked at each other, Yue Weiwei finally couldn’t contain her emotions, and she ran over. When they got close, Yue Weiwei hugged him before Lin Yun could speak, and they maintained this posture.

“Big Brother Lin, I thought that I wouldn’t be able to see you again.” Yue Weiwei couldn’t help tearing up when she saw Lin Yun. When she left Heavenly Fragrance Saint Mountain, she didn’t expect to meet Lin Yun again.

She made a huge decision because of the words her mother left her before she died, and she also didn’t want to let down the Heavenly Fragrance Saint Mountain’s teachings. But she regretted it the moment she left until she heard someone mentioning the ninth testing ground five days ago, where she heard about Flower Burial. This made her rejoice since Flower Burial was naturally Lin Yun.

“Don’t cry.” Lin Yun wiped Yue Weiwei’s tears for her.

This left Xi Yuan dumbfounded. The Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain wasn’t only acquainted with Lin Yun, but they even had an extraordinary relationship for them to be so intimate. This made her feel disbelief because the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son tried wooing her for a few days but couldn’t even attract Yue Weiwei’s attention.

Lin Jiangxian, who was next to Lin Yun, was first shocked before she wore a smile. She thought that Lin Yun was a blockhead who knew nothing about love, but it turned out that he had such a side to him. They look so adorable together that even she was affected by their sweetness.

On the other hand, Ji Zixi had a veil covering her face; otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to control her emotions. But she knew their past, whose love story spread during the Nirvana Banquet, which made her envious for a long time. Beneath the Three-Lives Tree, they determined their love.

When Ji Zixi heard someone talking about it, she only found it romantic, and it was a pity that it wasn’t her. She knew she couldn’t compete with Yue Weiwei, who came before her. Not to mention that she hadn’t stepped into Lin Yun’s heart yet.

Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei’s intimate actions caused an uproar, leaving everyone shocked with disbelief.

“So it’s Flower Burial from the ninth testing ground.” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son and those from Qilin Mountain said after they recovered from their shock.

“That’s me.” Lin Yun pulled Yue Weiwei to the side and asked, “Is there anything you need?”

“Nothing. I have heard of you before, and I know that you’re from a barbaric realm, the Kunlun Realm. My Qilin Mountain is a holy land for swordsmen, and we have the Qilin Sword Immortal around. If you’re interested, I can introduce you when the Heavenly Barren Banquet ends. It has been a long time since I took in a Saint Servant,” the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son smiled.

Everyone was shocked. They never expected the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son to be so frank. The Qilin Sword Immortal was a legend in the three thousand realms, known for his unrivaled swordsmanship amongst the deities. Since he had the temperament of an immortal, he was called Qilin Sword Immortal.

It was the dream for many swordsmen to become a disciple of the Qilin Sword Immortal, but that was hard as it was long rumored that the Qilin Sword Immortal no longer accepted disciples. A Saint Servant was another term for a divine son’s servant, and they wouldn’t have to enter Qilin Mountain to cultivate if they followed the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son.

Lin Yun said nothing, but Lin Jiangxian was furious as she coldly said, “You want Lin Yun to become your Saint Servant? The way I see it, it should be the other way around instead!”

Lin Jiangxian felt that Lin Yun was destined to become the Sword God with peerless talent in the sword. She was passionate about Sword Dao, which was engraved in her bones and soul. Lin Yun was the most talented swordsman that she had seen, and he was destined to reach the end of Sword Dao.

So even if the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son had a noble status, wanting Lin Yun to become his servant was an insult to Sword Dao. Where did the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son get the face and guts to say those words?

Xi Yuan was startled by Lin Jiangxian’s words. Even Lin Yun was stumped since he never expected Lin Jiangxian to have such a huge reaction.

Lin Yun looked at Lin Jiangxian, and said, “The Qilin Sword Immortal? He might not be stronger than my master, and I have no intention of becoming someone’s servant.”
