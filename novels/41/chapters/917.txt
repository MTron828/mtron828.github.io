Chapter 918 - My Name, My Sword

Everyone was anxiously waiting outside the barrier because they knew that Mo Han, Shi Feng, Lin Yun, and Chen An would eventually run into each other. They wanted to see who would get eliminated first.

If they didn’t witness Lin Yun kill Feng Wuji, no one would be optimistic of his chances. But after witnessing his strength, they wouldn’t doubt him anymore. It was just a shame that Lin Yun revealed all of his trump cards.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The crowd was really unsure if Lin Yun would get far because the other three still had their dao artifacts. Since Lin Yun had revealed his hand, Mo Han, Shi Feng, and Chen An were sure to use their dao artifacts right off the bat.

“Lin Yun should have left Flamefeather City when he had the chance. He’s really daring to compete for the Glorysun Spirit.”

“He had already offended the Bloodbone Realm by killing Feng Wuji. If he offends another higher realm, he will be doomed.”

“Even if he doesn’t know how terrifying the higher realms are, how can he compete with Mo Han, Chen An, and Shi Feng? He already revealed his trump card.” Clearly, the crowd didn’t think Lin Yun had a chance in the long run.

Only Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong stayed silent the entire time. The people who were mocking Lin Yun wouldn’t know how terrifying Lin Yun was without facing him directly. All of them had a prideful attitude and couldn’t accept or tolerate the fact that Lin Yun killed Feng Wuji.

“Lin Yun is a little too rash. The Glorysun Spirit is useless since it's sealed. The only thing it will do is bring him a little fame,” sighed Chen Xuan.

Chen Xuan wasn’t afraid that Lin Yun would be killed. In his opinion, it wouldn’t be a problem for Lin Yun to leave if he couldn’t obtain the Glorysun Spirit. He simply thought Lin Yun was wasting time. After all, the news of Feng Wuji getting killed would surely spread out. At that time, many people would come for Lin Yun.

The higher realms had life tokens that would place a tracker on their killer. When the life token shattered, a strand of animosity would flow out from the token and envelop the murderer. If the Bloodbone Realm had this, Lin Yun had nowhere left to hide in the Heavenly Path.

Chen Xuan believed that Lin Yun should have left to become stronger before the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm opened. Only then would Lin Yun have a chance.

Suddenly, a figure flew out of the barrier and coughed up a mouthful of blood. His face was extremely pale and his ribs were caved in.

Based on the whip that the unsightly figure was holding, everyone knew who it was. If it wasn’t for the whip, it would have been difficult to recognize Chen An. When the crowd saw Chen An, they couldn’t help but wonder who injured him.

“I’m finally out.” Chen An sighed in relief as he caught his breath.

“It’s Chen An! Why is he the first one out?”

“I wonder who injured him.” Chen An’s appearance created an uproar from the crowd. Even the geniuses from the higher realms were surprised. After all, they thought Lin Yun would be eliminated first since he didn't have a dao artifact.

While everyone examined Chen An, an earth-shattering sound boomed as a dazzling sword ray shot out of the barrier. The sword ray tore a hole through the barrier, terrifying all of the spectators as they quickly retreated.

“Damn it!” Chen An’s eyes flashed with shock as he poured all of his origin energy into his whip. In the next second, the Blood Viper Whip grew 3,000 meters. The whip released a torrential crimson radiance that turned an unlucky few into piles of meat.

Chen An’s eyes became bloodshot as he focused on blocking the sword. As long as he focused, blocking the attack with his dao artifact should be easy. Even if he couldn’t block it, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to survive.

As long as he was alive, he had many ways of recovering. Simultaneously, the terrifying phenomenon created by the Blood Viperwhip left the spectators dumbfounded. Was this the full power of a genius from the higher realms with a dao artifact? The shockwave from the dao artifact alone could easily kill the geniuses from Glorysun Land.

“You only need one sword to kill? You think you can kill me?! Feng Wuji is nothing compared to me!” Chen An sneered with confidence. However, as soon as he finished speaking, his face became grave as a red line revealed itself on his forehead.

When the sword ray exploded, Chen An was split in half. Chen An was correct in that he could block Lin Yun’s sword with the dao artifact. However, Lin Yun’s sword was so quick that it claimed his life before he could even bring out the power of his dao artifact. Chen An had already died without him realizing it.

As soon as Chen An died, the dao artifact returned to being a whip. Everyone was silent as they could still hear a weak sword hum in the air. At this moment, everyone was frozen as if an invisible force was holding them down.

A long time later, the crowd finally recovered. “Holy shit, what just happened?!”

“H-how is this possible?!”

“Is he human? How can a swordsman from a lower realm be so strong!”

“He actually only needs one sword to kill!”

“Damn it! Why did Chen An die? He’s a genius from higher realms like us! Plus, he’s almost in the Azure Dragon Ranking!” The higher realm geniuses couldn’t accept Lin Yun’s strength. After all, the higher realms acted however they wanted with no regard for anyone else. With Lin Yun around, the higher realms were losing their invincible status.

When Lin Yun killed Feng Wuji, everyone found an excuse to dismiss Lin Yun’s strength. But this time, they couldn’t find an excuse for Chen An’s death.

In Lin Yun’s eyes, there was nothing special about the higher realms. He would simply cut them down with his sword. Only Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong knew how strong Lin Yun was and refrained from mocking him.

Unlike the geniuses from higher realms, the geniuses from Glorysun Land roared with excitement. Even Liu Yun became emotional when he saw this. His eyes turned red as his hands trembled. “This is the grace of a swordsman! I will become a swordsman like him one day in the future! Lin Yun is right, why can’t we compete with the higher realms? As swordsmen, we don’t fear anything!”

A breeze blew through the crowd and carried Lin Yun’s lingering sword intent throughout the city. Lin Yun might not be around, but his actions lit a fire in everyone’s chest. Suddenly, the crowd recalled Chen An’s dao artifact, so they stared at the Blood Viper Whip.

“Let’s take Blood Viper Whip!” A few people stepped forward. They weren’t greedy for the dao artifact since it belonged to the Nethercloud Realm. After all, if the Nethercloud Realm knew that someone took a dao artifact that belonged to them, it would definitely create trouble for them. However, they didn’t want the peasants from Glorysun Land to take it.

Their goal was to take the whip and return it to the Nethercloud Realm. It would really help boost their relationship with the Nethercloud Realm.

However, when they got close to the whip, it suddenly came to life and started moving. In a fit of rage, they dodged the whip. A Dragon-blooded Cat held onto the whip with a grin. It played with the whip while the higher realm geniuses glared at it.

“Where did this bastard come from!” The geniuses started cursing as they lost their temper.

When Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen saw the Dragon-blooded Cat, their jaws dropped. Isn’t that Lin Yun’s pet? Why is that ancestor here?

Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen became worried when the four geniuses from higher realms charged at the Dragon-blooded Cat. They wanted to give a warning, but it was too late.
