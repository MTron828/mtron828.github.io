Chapter 873 - Drawing Sword!

Everyone was staring at Lin Yun. No one would want to bow down to someone else, so they understood how Lin Yun felt. However, Lin Yun was just as calm as when he beat up Tang Yan.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with disdain, “Sorry, but I don’t have a habit of becoming a dog. If you’re willing to hand over the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm, I can consider sparing your life. As for becoming my dog, you’re not qualified!”

Lin Yun would never become someone’s lackey, not to mention that Nangong He wasn’t even comparable to Lil’ Red. Nangong He barely qualified to be Lil’ Red’s lackey. Lin Yun’s arrogance caused a huge uproar because the crowd knew that Nangong He would be enraged. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Slowly, the smile on Nangong He’s face disappeared. His face became terrifyingly cold and everyone could sense the chill coming from him. It was so cold that many people were shivering.

Nangong He smiled, “Lin Yun, you don't seem to realize your current position. Not everyone is qualified to be my dog. After all, I’m destined to rise in the Heavenly Path. The Heavenly Path is a place filled with opportunities. Do you think you’re even qualified to be a stepping stone if you don’t follow me?”

Tang Yan’s eyes flashed coldly, “Lin Yun, don’t push it. My senior brother is holding you in high regard to take you as his lackey. There are a lot of people willing to take that position. If you become my senior brother’s lackey, you won’t have to submit astral pellets anymore!”

Tang Yan was giving Lin Yun a chance to submit to the Flamecloud Realm. Although it sounded nasty, many people were envious of that position.

“Big Brother Nangong, since Lin Yun isn’t willing to bow to you, our Azurehawk Realm is willing!”

“So is my Stonedragon Realm!”

“My Shadowfang Realm too!” Three people stood out among the crowd and kneeled. The three had some fame in the city as they were the strongest of their realms. Following their lead, many experts fell to their knees.

Tang Yan wore a smug grin when he saw this scene and laughed, “Lin Yun, I’ll give you another chance…”

“No need.” Nangong He waved his hand and smiled, “I don’t like to force people. Since you’re not willing to bow, then die!”

In the next second, Nangong He’s body disappeared. When he reappeared, boundless origin energy poured out from his body and caused the sky to tremble. Then, his origin energy turned into a boundless sea of flames. “Boundless Flaming Ocean!”

Lin Yun’s gaze wandered around and his sword intent soon spotted a figure among the sea of flames.

“Too slow.” Nangong He smiled. Flashing out of the sea of flames, he threw a punch towards Lin Yun. Lin Yun had expected this, so he quickly executed the Cloudsoaring Art to dodge the attack.

“Still too slow!” Nangong He moved like a venomous viper. Relying on his Heavenly Soul Realm’s pressure, he charged at Lin Yun once more.

Lin Yun smirked and retreated calmly. He wanted to see how strong Nangong He was since he reached the limit of his quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. As they fought, the terrifying fluctuation emitted from them left many people shocked, especially Nangong He’s aura. His aura didn’t seem to belong to someone who had just stepped into the Heavenly Soul Realm.

The aura coming from Nangong He was too powerful. Lin Yun wasn’t weak since he could easily defeat Tang Yan. However, when facing Nangong He, he could only defend himself and retreat.

“Hehe, this is only the beginning.” Tang Yan sneered. “My senior brother hasn’t even used 30% of his strength. If the three of you are willing to be my senior brother’s lackeys, you guys might actually have a chance to rise in the Heavenly Path.”

“Of course. How can a piece of trash from the Profound Amber Realm compare to Brother Nangong?” Azurehawk Realm’s Zhang Feng grinned as if he had become a member of the Flamecloud Realm.

The two others also smiled, “In the future, we will need Brother Tang to look after us.”

“Brother Tang is a dragon among people. If he wasn’t caught by surprise, there’s no way the brat could defeat him!”

Tang Yan’s smile grew even denser as he was flattered by the compliments. He smiled, “If I wasn't afraid that I might kill him, I could’ve easily crushed him!”

Looking at this scene, Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan felt indignant because Tang Yan was only relying on Nangong He’s prestige to boast. However, they were concerned with Lin Yun’s outcome, so they couldn’t be bothered with them.

Seeing Nangong He push his flame intent and origin energy in the Heavenly Soul Realm to the limit, Lin Yun was full of disappointment. Nangong He wasn’t as strong as he had imagined.

Pushing Lin Yun a few steps back, Nangong He laughed, “Brat, you can be considered capable to last so long against me. But this is your limit!”

Nangong He clenched his fist together and gathered the sea of flames in his hand. In the next second, terrifying flames covered Nangong He as heat waves spread out. The entire city was instantly enveloped in a high temperature as Nangong He attacked, “Die!”

Interesting! Lin Yun sneered inwardly. Circulating his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra and Iris Sword Sutra, the two different origin energies combined perfectly together as a brilliant sword hum echoed from his body.

The origin energy from his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra alone was terrifying, not to mention that he merged his Iris Sword Sutra into it. As the origin energy exploded from within his body, two bright colors manifested two dragons that coiled around his body.

In that split second, Lin Yun and Nangong He had exchanged over a dozen moves. Lin Yun’s punches destroyed Nangong He’s attacks and sent him flying. When Nangong He landed on the ground, blood dripped down from his lips as deep shock filled his eyes.

H-how is this possible?! Everyone was shocked when they saw this scene because they never expected to see Nangong He go flying. Even Tang Yan’s face became nasty. “That brat actually injured Senior Brother Nangong. He’s dead now.”

“Interesting…” Nangong He wiped the blood off of his lips as his face sank. “You’re the first person to injure me since I came to the Heavenly Path. But this ends now!”

When he finished, three ancient seals appeared on his palm and started to rotate. Boundless flames started to gather behind him as if he was starting a summoning ritual.

“What martial technique is this? Why is it so terrifying?!” Everyone was shocked by the powerful aura coming from the flames.

“Flamecloud Incinerating Palm. That is the genuine Flamecloud Incinerating Palm, unlike mine. Senior Brother Nangong has grasped its essence and refined his flame seals to the azure color!” Tang Yan looked at the flames and his gaze began to turn cold. He sneered at Lin Yun as if he were a dead man.

“That’s the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm, but it’s a lot stronger this time.”

“This is the Flamecloud Realm’s strongest attack. It looks like Nangong He lost his patience.”

“Lin Yun will die for sure now!”

When Nangong He was forced to bring out his strongest attack, countless indifferent gazes fell onto Lin Yun.

“Brat, you’ve missed your chance.” Nangong He’s gaze was cold and he didn’t give Lin Yun the time to react as he roared, “Flamecloud Incinerating Palm!”

The flaming halos looked like a gate as a gigantic palm blazing with azure flames. When the gigantic palm descended, it nearly destroyed the entire plaza. Under the immense pressure, all the buildings on the plaza started to crumble.

Everyone bgan running for their lives, but the moment they soared into the sky, their bodies froze. Just when they were all baffled, a wisp of sword ray suddenly lit up the entire sky.

What’s going on? Fear loomed over their hearts because they had never experienced this in the past. By the time they recovered from their shock, they all fell from the sky. Immediately, everyone turned around and saw Lin Yun slowly sheathing his sword.

No one was able to see Lin Yun’s attack. Right at this moment, a brilliant sword ray exploded as sword rays gushed out of Nangong He’s neck. Then, his head went flying.

“That attack was worthy of me drawing my sword,” said Lin Yun before he put away his sword.
