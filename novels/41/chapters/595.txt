Chapter 596 - Green-eyed Fiendzombies

As the footsteps got closer, Guo Xu began to hesitate. He knew that he would be giving the newcomer an opportunity to take advantage of the situation if he continued his battle with Lin Yun. After all, none of the geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking were generous and they wouldn’t be courteous with him if he wasn’t strong enough.

So it might become unrealistic for him to kill Lin Yun. Lin Yun could also roughly sense that the newcomer wasn’t any weaker than Guo Xu. So, there was a high possibility that the newcomer was also someone on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

The elites on the Dragoncloud Ranking felt superior to each other. However, if they decided to join hands, it would be troublesome for anyone to deal with. Then again, that was naturally the worst case scenario as geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking were prideful. It was highly unlikely that they would join hands to deal with someone who wasn’t on the ranking.

But regardless of this logic, Lin Yun had to make preparations for the worse case possible. Even if the two did join hands, there was no way he would give up on the Profound Yin Water.

Right at this moment, Guo Xu’s eyes lit up as he looked at Lin Yun and smiled, “I know who you are. You’re Flower Burial Lin Yun.”

Lin Yun, however, remained silent and didn’t give a reply.

“There aren’t many in the Ancient Southern Domain who can train their sword intent to greater mastery. With your young age and cultivation in the pinnacle Yin stage, I can’t think of anyone except for the Flower Burial who defeated Cao Zhen,” continued Guo Xu.

“I’m honored that you know me,” replied Lin Yun.

“But if you think that you can defeat me with just your sword intent, then I can only say that you’re too naive,” replied Guo Xu.

“Nah, I’ve never thought like that,” smiled Lin Yun. It was naturally impossible for him to use his sword intent at greater mastery to defeat Guo Xu. However, what Guo Xu didn’t know was that his sword intent was in complete mastery. Furthermore, his sword intent wasn’t his sole trump card.

They were both fearful of each other, which meant that they had acknowledged each other’s strength. At the same time, the faint footsteps continued approaching them.

“It’s him!” Guo Xu’s face changed as he recognized the newcomer. “Scarlet Demonwhip, Yang Fan!”

Lin Yun had heard of this name from Mo Ling. Yang Fan was the chief disciple of the quasi-overlord force Scarlet Sect from the Azure Prefecture. They were proficient in using whips, which was rare in the Ancient Southern Domain.

Yang Fan was ranked sixty-seven last year and he was slightly stronger than Guo Xu. When Fang Yan came to a stop after revealing his skinny frame. He was holding onto a red whip and his eyes looked like they belonged to a venomous viper.

He looked at Lin Yun and Guo Xu before turning to the Profound Yin Water, “Guo Xu, you’ve really declined. You can’t even deal with a brat in the pinnacle Yin stage? Could it be that you’re going to give him a share of the Profound Yin Water?”

“He should be qualified to have a share,” said Guo Xu.

“Based on what?” questioned Yang Fan.

“His greater master xiantian sword intent. If you don’t mind fighting him before the empyrean’s tomb, you can give it a try,” smiled Guo Xu.

“Interesting. Then let’s just split it between the three of us.” Yang Fan was a decisive person. After he confirmed that Lin Yun grasped the greater mastery of xiantian sword intent, he immediately made his decision. But he still couldn’t help taking a look at Lin Yun. After all, it was rare to cultivate the xiantian sword intent to greater mastey at such a young age.

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t disagree. He didn’t need all the Profound Yin Water as long as they were enough for him to use. With that, the three of them took out a bottle and split the Profound Yin Water.

Throughout the entire process, Guo Xu and Yang Fan looked at Lin Yun with envy. After all, they were both in the pinnacle Yang stage. The Profound Yin Water might be precious, but there was no way they could refine it. They could only swap it for other resources. It was only suitable for Lin Yun to use.

By refining the Profound Yin Water, one could leave the other elite disciples of the various overlord forces behind. For instance, Lin Yun could leave Guo Xu behind very quickly. Guo Xuo knew that Lin Yun would take another step forward after refining the Profound Yin Water. However, it was a pity that Lin Yun was strong because it was too unrealistic for him to kill Lin Yun.

After packing the Profound Yin Water, Lin Yun turned around and left. He was also afraid of those two and he didn’t want to stay here any longer.

“Wait up.” Just when Lin Yun was about to leave, Yang Fan called out to him. This instantly made the hall’s atmosphere tense up as Guo Xu’s face had changed as well. Was Yang Fan going to make a move against Lin Yun? If that was the case, then it was good news for Guo Xu…

“What is it?” Lin Yun asked without turning around.

“Since you’ve grasped the greater mastery of xiantian sword intent, you’re also qualified to stay behind. There’s a cultivating chamber in this underground palace and there should be some ancient martial techniques there. Are you interested?” asked Yang Fan.

“Ancient martial techniques? Wasn’t this underground palace already searched? It’s already a dead-end up ahead,” asked Guo Xu.

“A dead-end? Haha!” Yang Fan sneered as he swung the whip in his hand at the wall. Under the huge explosion, a portion of the wall was torn apart by the whip. Not only that, but the spiritual array in the wall was also destroyed. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Although the spiritual array had weakened over time, the power behind Yang Fan’s whip still shocked Lin Yun. If he were to compare the power of Yang Fan’s origin power to his, he would fall short. Even with sword ntent empowering his attacks, Lin Yun wasn’t confident that he could win against Yang Fan.

“Come with me.” Yang Fan walked in and spoke, “In an underground palace like this with a long history, there will definitely be puppets. The two of you have to be careful. Lin Yun is still fine because sword intent has a strong advantage against the puppets. As for you, Guo Xu, just pray that you’ll get through this.”

“Hmph, are you looking down on me?” Guo Xu snorted, but he had also become more cautious. Clearly, he knew how powerful those puppets could be.

Lin Yun had fought with puppets in the Azure Sun Realm and Demonlotus Realm, so he knew how powerful they could be. But since Yang Fan said that there was a chamber that stored ancient martial techniques, it should be true. If he could obtain those martial techniques, then the risk would be worth it.

The tunnel was dark and eerie. The only light came from the candles on the wall, which made the trio even more nervous as they knew that they were putting their lives on the line.

“There’s a fork in the road,” said Guo Xu when he saw the three-way split up ahead.

“Let’s split up then,” said Yang Fan. He then headed forward without turning back.

Guo Xu cursed softly and chose the path on the left. As for Lin Yun, his only choice was the path on the right. At the end of the tunnel, Lin Yun found a stone chamber that was submerged in rocks, but he easily pushed them apart. When Lin Yun entered, he didn’t find anything except for a stone coffin.

This made Lin Yun’s face change as he slowly retreated out back to the split way.

“What did you find?” Yang Fan asked. He clearly had no harvest on his side.

“A stone coffin,” replied Lin Yun honestly.

Yang Fan shrugged and smiled, “Looks like our luck isn’t great. Let’s go. If Guo Xu doesn’t have any harvest, then we can only return.”

But right at this moment, a ferocious roar sounded out from the ferocious battle up ahead. Simultaneously, the ground began to tremble.

“Looks like he got pretty lucky. Let’s go and see if he’s dead,” said Yang Fan as his eyes lit up. He charged ahead as Lin Yun followed behind.

When they arrived in the stone chamber that Guo Xu was in, they were shocked. There were four mats at the center and there were three withered old men sitting on those mats with their heads lowered.

On the other hand, Guo Xu was fighting with an old man. The old man’s movements were stiff, but fast. The old man was shrouded in a faint demonic aura and his pupils glowed green.

When they came in, Guo Xu was in a rather terrible state. His punches couldn’t injure this demonic zombie and all he could do was try forcing it back. The zombie was extremely ferocious and it also began to increase its attacking speed.

“Help out quick!” Guo Xu yelled out at Yang Fan and Lin Yun.

But before Guo Xu could finish yelling, the three old men on the other mats raised their heads up. Their eyes were filled with bloodlust and sinister intentions. The green glow from their eyes lit up the entire stone chamber. When they looked at Lin Yun, Lin Yun could sense a sinister aura trying to invade his mind.

At the same time, Lin Yun also felt that his movements were starting to get sluggish. He now knew why Guo Xu was in such a terrible state when facing the zombie. It looks like these zombies weren’t the same as the ones he faced in the past.

The zombies he faced in the past had black eyes, not these strange green eyes.

“Looks like we’re pretty lucky to run into four Green-eyed Fiendzombies,” sneered Yang Fan as he lashed out his whip.

Lin Yun’s eyes also surged with boundless xiantian sword intent as the sinister aura trying to invade his consciousness disappeared. At the same time, Lin Yun slanted to the side by instinct as a black bolt of lightning flew past him. In the next second, the claw of the zombie that came after him plunged into the wall where he previously stood.

“What swift speed!” Lin Yun was startled. If he was slightly slower, he would have been torn apart. With that, Lin Yun had a rough estimation of how powerful the Green-eyed Fiendzombies were.

Lin Yun ripped off a cloth from his clothes and poured his origin energy into it, making it straight like a sword. Moving his sword lightly, seven silver rays stabbed out at the zombie and pinned it into the wall.
