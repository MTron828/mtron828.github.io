Chapter 963 - Bunch of Clowns

Lin Yun’s transformation after reaching the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm far exceeded his imagination. Excited, he used origin energy to execute the Divine Sun Breaking Seal. When the winged human appeared behind him, the entire region became quiet as if time was frozen still.

At the same time, the ancient seal burned with golden flames that dyed his hand gold. In fact, the golden brilliance climbed up to half of his arm.

“Oh my…” Lin Yun’s face changed with shock. Is this the true power of a monarch fortune martial technique? The Divine Glorysun Fist was a special advanced fortune martial technique. If one had enough talent, they could take it to the height of an imperial fortune martial technique. But without enough talent, it was a low grade overlord fortune martial technique.

If Lin Yun was able to complete this martial technique, he might even transcend the grade of fortune martial techniques. When Lin Yun refined the monarch beast core of the Gold-furred Demonic Ape, he reached the level of the monarch fortune martial technique. However, his cultivation was too low to display the power, so many people confused it for an imperial fortune martial technique. Advanced martial techniques were classified into overlord, imperial, and monarch techniques, and Lin Yun reached the pinnacle.

Lin Yun rejoiced after a brief moment of shock. He could finally compete with the other owners of the astral spirits. He was confident that he could deal with them without relying on his sky sword intent. WIth a wave of his hand, Lin Yun dispersed the Divine Sun Breaking Seal. Then, Lil’ Red ran over and started to make gestures with its paws.

“Did the help arrive?” Lin Yun smiled coldly.

Liu Mu and the others were sitting outside of the demonic fog. They spent two days preparing for Lin Yun to come out. On a huge rock, Liu Mu, Mo Yan, and Xu Que stood together while watching the demonic fog with killing intent in their eyes.

All three of them suffered at the hands of Lin Yun and were greatly humiliated. Naturally, their hatred for Lin Yun ran deep in their bones. If Lin Yun was a higher realm genius, they would have accepted their fate. However, Lin Yun was an ant from a lower realm.

“No matter what, he has to die!” Liu Mu said while gritting his teeth.

“Is that fellow still undergoing his tribulation? It’s been two days…” Xu Que’s eyes flashed with annoyance. At this point, he was out of patience.

“That brat will show up sooner or later. Is Mu Ziyi done setting up the Constellation Dragon Locking Array? It’s been two days,” said Mo Yan.

“Hehe, it’s done.” Mu Ziyi’s voice sounded out right at this moment as he landed next to Liu Mu.

“What took so long?” Liu Mu frowned his brows unhappily. They had to chase away the crowds and offended many people in order to give Mu Ziyi enough space to set up the Constellation Dragon Locking Array.

“It’s not easy to set up a spiritual diagram refined with ten beast cores containing dragon bloodline. But it’s finally done. Even if that brat is strong, there’s no way he can escape death.” Mu Ziyi’s face was somewhat pale as he had exhausted a great deal of his mental energy over the past two days.

“Let me show you guys the power of a fourth-grade spiritualist!” Mu Ziyi sneered while his hands formed seals. Spiritual runes quickly spread out from his body as ten paintings appeared in the sky.

Boundless resentment poured out like blood when the paintings unfolded, completely filling the sky. Suddenly, Liu Mu and the others felt threatened as if ten pairs of eyes were watching them. Each painting looked like a crimson star wrapped in chains. It brought shock to the faces of Liu Mu and the rest. After all, they couldn’t imagine how terrifying the array would be after activation.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Impressive. No wonder you’re the leader of the Profound Spirit Realm. Even the owners of the astral spirits will have trouble facing this array,” exclaimed Liu Mu. The geniuses from the higher realms could tell that Lin Yun was doomed now that four higher realms were joining forces.

“Scatter!” Mu Ziyi formed a seal and the paintings rolled up before disappearing into the sky.

With a sinister expression, Xu Que said, “There’s no way he can escape now unless he hides in there for the rest of his life!”

Liu Mu suddenly smiled, “He’s really tough. He didn’t die in the tribulation.”

“Oh?” Mo Yan, Mu Ziyi, and Xu Que rejoiced when they heard that. Then, they sensed an immense power approaching from the demonic fog.

“Great timing!” Mo Yan sneered. “I bet he’s excited because of the boost in his strength. The higher he is, the harder he’ll fall. He’s about to find out what cruelty really is!”

As the spectators watched Lin Yun approach, they felt bad for him. They couldn’t see a way out for Lin Yun now that four higher realms were involved.

“Brother Mo Yan, you want to show me what cruelty looks like? Haha. What’s more cruel than watching your monarch beast core getting snatched by someone else?” Lin Yun’s laughter sounded out.

“Lin Yun, don’t you know that you won’t be able to escape? If you’re willing to kneel and hand over your treasures, we can consider giving you an easy death!” Mo Yan glared at Lin Yun with killing intent. But when he looked at Lin Yun, he had a feeling that Lin Yun wasn’t the same as he was before.

However, there were four higher realms as well as the Constellation Dragon Locking Array, so he really didn’t need to worry. Furthermore, everyone was going to bring out their trump cards to deal with Lin Yun.

“This brat seems different,” frowned Xu Que.

“It looks like he got stronger from his second tribulation. Thankfully, we set up a net for him. Otherwise, he might have escaped our grasp.” Liu Mu’s eyes flashed before he barked, “Mo Yan, Xu Que, let’s go. Don’t hold back this time!”

With those words, all three of them charged at Lin Yun. It was a strong formation consisting of fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realms.

Although Lin Yun shined brightly at the shrine, there was no way he could repeat his previous performance. After all, everyone who suffered at Lin Yun’s hands were bringing out their full strength.

Lin Yun stopped Lil’ Red from charging forward and decided to deal with the trouble himself. He faced the pressure to resolve the grudges he had all on his own.

As Lin Yun took a step forward, many people were terrified. They couldn’t imagine facing the leaders of higher realms whose foundation ran deeper than ordinary higher realms.

Even when Lin Yun fought Liu Mu before, he was still all alone. So how could he face three people at once without the help of his Dragon BLooded Cat? Wasn’t he courting death?

“You’re just as arrogant as before!” Liu Mu smiled upon seeing this scene. He had hoped that Lin Yun would act arrogant so he could enjoy Lin Yun’s expression of defeat.

“Kill!” Mo Yan and Xu Que laughed as they charged forward. Initially, they thought that Lin Yun would try to run away, but Lin Yun was actually charged straight at them.

“Glory of the Sun!”

“Demon Light Dragon Armor!”

“Crimson Demon Armored Fist!” All three of them attacked Lin Yun in a split second with their strongest attacks.

“What a bunch of clowns!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly upon looking at this scene.
