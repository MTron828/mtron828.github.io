Chapter 1825 - Square Beneath The Pool, Black Tortoise Saint Rune

Kou Tianhua was the first to make a move, charging at the nine Black Tortoise Cores.

“Go!” Yu Wenxiu also gave an order before charging over with the Ming Cult’s disciples. Both parties immediately fought over the nine Black Tortoise Cores, and the hundreds of people who came over also quickly joined in, instantly making the complicated situation even more chaotic.

“Let’s go down first.” Lin Yun said. The golden-purple dragon runes then began to surge on his body as they dived into the Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool. After all, it was impossible for so many people to split the nine Black Tortoise Cores, so they might as well dive into the pool first and take the lead at the real treasure.

An Liuyan nodded her head. As a white dragon coiled around her, she swiftly followed Lin Yun.

The corner of Mei Zihua’s lips twitched. He didn’t have a Divine Dragon Bone, and his cultivation was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm. It was a little tough for him to enter the Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool, but he still gritted his teeth and followed after them.

It didn’t take long for the competition between the nine Black Tortoise Cores to come to an end. Kou Tianhua only managed to seize three, and he was furiously looking at the Black Tortoise Cores in the hands of others. But he couldn’t be bothered about that now.

“Dive into the pond, now.” Kou Tianhua coldly looked at those people before diving into the pool with Yuan Hengying and Lady Stone.

“Senior Brother, what should we do now?” Huang Xuanyi asked.

Yu Wenxiu briefly pondered before he replied, “Kou Tianhua and Lin Yun aren’t that easy to deal with. But there must be treasures within the Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool. We’ll quickly dive in!”

After multiple splashes, everyone came to their senses and dived into the Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool.

Within the Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool, Lin Yun was enveloped in dragon runes while pushing his movement technique to the limit to go further down the pool. He wanted to know what was hidden within this pool.

He was like a dragon as he dived down the pool, and the lightning magma within the pool would occasionally emit a powerful lightning arc. Those lightning arcs were powerful when they landed on the body, and anyone without sufficient strength wouldn’t even be able to last in the pool for half an incense of time.

Further away from Lin Yun’s group of three, there was a large group of people, and everyone knew that there were treasures within the Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool.

“They’re quick.” Lin Yun casually glanced behind. He entered the pool first, but they weren’t that far away. If there were treasures at the bottom of the pool, a battle would be unavoidable. As he sank down, he finally arrived at the bottom of the pool and discovered waves of powerful energy.

A brief moment later, Lin Yun discovered that there was a massive vortex at the bottom of the pool, and the vortex was surging with silver brilliance.

He knew that should be it. He came to the edge of the vortex and entered it without any hesitation. When he passed through the vortex, his vision opened up at the bottom of the pool. This was a square paved with stone slabs. The stone slabs were also engraved with ancient runes. All the saint runes had converged together to form a massive Black Tortoise diagram.

Looking at it closely, he could see the diagram rippling, making it look as though it was alive. This was only a misperception caused by the ripples. In reality, the Black Tortoise didn’t move at all.

There were many people scattered around the Black Tortoise with their legs crossed together, but none of them were alive. This made Lin Yun surprised because all these people might’ve been at the Quasi-Saint Realm, and the Black Tortoise Cores should be their remains. This made him wonder what these Quasi-Saints were protecting for them to even die here, but he had a feeling it had something to do with the Black Tortoise engravement.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Right then, a Quasi-Saint’s remains exploded, turning into a Black Tortoise Core that flew towards the vortex. Seeing this, Lin Yun waved his hand and the Black Tortoise Core flew into it.

But he had learned his lesson this time. He didn’t directly grab onto it. He wrapped it around with his dragon origin before sealing it and placing it into his interspatial pouch. This was a weird feeling because he had obtained a Black Tortoise Core so easily.

Taking a closer look, there were at least dozens of remains here, and he couldn’t imagine the sheer number of Black Tortoise Cores. After all, just a single Black Tortoise Core was extremely valuable in the outside world.

“I see…” Right then, Yu Wenxiu and the others arrived, along with Kou Tianhua’s party soon after. The other Profound Life Stage experts also quickly followed after them.

“So many Quasi-Saints, this is really a treasury!”

“Hahaha! This place is really filled with fortune. There are so many Black Tortoise Cores!”

“Just a few will make our trip in this palace complete.” Everyone was excitedly looking at the remains. Looking at the Quasi-Saint remains, all their eyes were filled with greed.

Very quickly, everyone pounced towards the square. They all summoned their constellations. Under the heavy fluctuations of dragon origin, all the Quasi-Saint remains exploded with multiple Black Tortoise Cores flying out. Soon enough, this place fell into a chaotic fight, and every Black Tortoise Core would spark an intense fight.

Lin Yun’s gaze flickered. He wanted to find something unusual about this square. But because the surroundings were too chaotic, even his Sword Heart couldn’t perceive anything. He retracted his gaze and looked at An Liuyan, “We can compete for some Black Tortoise Cores. You have the White Dragon Bone, so you will greatly benefit from refining the Black Tortoise Core.”

An Liuyan’s body had been transformed by the White Dragon Bone, and she was stronger than many cultivators at the same level. If she could refine the Black Tortoise Cores, it would further strengthen the White Dragon Bone.

In fact, this was also what he needed. If the two saint physiques wanted to combine, he would need a lot of body-refining treasures. Aside from that, he also wanted to know if the Black Tortoise Core could stimulate his sword intent’s improvements.

“Good!” An Liuyan’s pupils were filled with excitement. She knew how precious the Black Tortoise Cores were.

Lin Yun and An Liuyan swiftly charged forth, snatching Black Tortoise Cores. This made Mei Zihua briefly stunned, and his face became pale. He felt powerless while looking at those Black Tortoise Cores. The battle was too intense, and he didn’t dare to use his musical instrument because it was no different from courting death.

“Haha! Charge!” Kou Tianhua grinned, dashing forth with Yuan Hengying and Lady Stone.

Yu Wenxiu looked around, and hesitated because this region was weird. But if they didn’t join the competition, the Black Tortoise Cores might be gone. So, after a brief hesitation, he ultimately made the decision to charge forth and compete for the Black Tortoise Cores.

A brief moment later, this square became bloody, especially after Kou Tianhua’s party joined in. They were brutal, and they would kill anyone who made them unhappy, aside from competing for the Black Tortoise Cores. It didn’t take long for this entire region to be covered in blood, making this square reek of blood.

But no one had noticed it. As the blood penetrated into the Black Tortoise engraving, the saint runes on it began to light up. In the depths of the square, there was a ten-foot high silver statue absorbing the blood from within the surrounding water.

“Eight!” Lin Yun protected himself with the dragon runes and obtained another Black Tortoise Core.

But because he had reservations against Kou Tianhua and Yu Wenxiu, Lin Yun didn’t dare to speed up his pace. Instead, he chose a stable method. Many people were anxious about the Black Tortoise Cores, and they were left in a pathetic state when the lightning entered their bodies. If they weren’t careful, they might even lose their lives on the spot.

Lin Yun came over to An Liuyan, and asked, “How many did you get?”

“Five!” An Liuyan said excitedly. It could be considered a fairly good harvest. After all, the battle here was too chaotic, and there were a lot of people competing for the cores, even if there were a lot. There was no limit to people’s greed, and many people had no intention of stopping after obtaining a few Black Tortoise Cores. It was fairly smooth for An Liuyan and Lin Yun because no one dared to come after them due to their fame.

“Young Master, that brat has almost obtained nine Black Tortoise Cores.” Yuan Hengying whispered beside Kou Tianhua. They only obtained nine after joining forces, and that was equivalent to Lin Yun’s harvest.

But Kou Tianhua didn’t take it seriously and smiled, “He has a strong physique, not to mention the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. So this place is suitable for him. Don’t bother about him for now. I’ll deal with him when he’s fat.”

Yuan Hengying instantly understood what Kou Tianhua planned to do. The latter wanted Lin Yun to help him collect Black Tortoise Cores before snatching it away.

Kou Tianhua briefly pondered and said, “You and Lady Stone pay attention to Yu Wenxiu. There’s something weird about him, so don’t let him get in the way.”

“Okay.” The two nodded their heads before they silently approached the Ming Cult’s disciples.

Yu Wenxiu naturally detected their presence, but he merely ignored them with a smile and continued to leisurely collect more Black Tortoise Cores.

Lin Yun didn’t pay attention to Kou Tianhua’s schemes, since he had already noticed someone eyeing him. He was actually looking forward to it because he could adapt to this region better than others thanks to the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. If they dared to make a move against him, he didn’t mind teaching them a lesson. After all, he had been unhappy with them for a long time.
