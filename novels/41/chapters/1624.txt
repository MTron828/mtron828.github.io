Chapter 1625 - No One Can Leave!

A few hundred miles away, the silver moonlight had condensed into a moon on a mountain, and a person was standing on the moon that stood out. This person was enveloped by the silver moonlight that made him look graceful.

“It’s Yan Kong!”

“Yan Kong is really here!”

“The Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple is doomed now. I’m afraid that he didn’t expect that Yan Kong was really here after being so high-profile earlier!” Yan Kong’s appearance instantly caused a commotion amongst the spectators who were paying attention to this battle.

After all, who in the Ancient Barren Battlefield wouldn’t know the top three in the Profound Sky Sect? They weren’t only the top three in the Profound Sky Sect but also the top three in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. The strength of the Golden Generation geniuses taught personally by Tian Xuanzi far exceeded everyone’s imagination, and Yan Kong’s appearance attracted everyone’s attention.

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren!”

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren!” The Profound Sky Sect’s disciples roared, making Yan Kong look extraordinary at the top of the snow mountain.

“Yan Kong is here. Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, come and receive your death!” Yan Kong roared. Waving his hand, he grabbed a hold of a Sword Sect’s disciple.

“Hahaha! Lin Yun, aren’t you arrogant? Beg me, and I’ll release them.” The Sword Sect’s disciple grabbed by Yan Kong was in pain as he struggled.

“My Sword Sect’s disciple can lose, but none of us are afraid of death! Yan Kong, don’t even think about using my life to threaten Senior Brother Lin!” That Sword Sect’s disciple struggled, and he circulated his dragon origin, which made his body start to heat up.

Yan Kong instantly realized that this Sword Sect’s disciple wanted to self-destruct. But just when he wanted to respond, it was already too late.

“Senior Brother Lin, take revenge for me!” That Sword Sect’s disciple exploded, and a terrifying sword ray ferociously blazed like a bright sun. But that radiance only lasted for a split second before it was extinguished; it was like a firework that bloomed for a moment.

“Ha. The Sword Sect’s disciple is really stubborn!” Yan Kong sneered, but there was no fluctuation on his face.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish, then!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. Waving his hand, he charged over at Yan Kong.

This scene made the hearts of Gongsun Yan, Ji Shuxuan, and Jin Xuanyi sink. That was the depths of the Saint Constellation Snow Valley, and Yan Kong was purposely trying to attract Lin Yun.

“Hahaha!” Yan Kong laughed with mockery within his pupils before disappearing in a flash.

Lin Yun’s speed was fast, and he landed on this empty ground in a few flashes. The ground was covered in snow, and many corpses were on the ground. Among the bodies were disciples of the Sword Sect and Profound Sky Sect.

Yan Kong landed on the mountain not too far away and coldly looked at Lin Yun. The Saint Constellation Snow Valley wasn’t far from him, and an intense battle was still ongoing. This relieved Lin Yun because most of the Sword Sect’s disciples were still around.

Suddenly, several streaks flew over, and seven figures appeared behind Yan Kong. They were the chief disciples of the various big sects, and they were geniuses of the Golden Generation. They were talented and considered elites on the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

They hovered in the air and gave off a terrifying pressure like a mountain with light shining brightly on their bodies. They were like ancient divine generals, possessing top-tiered saint artifacts, thirty thousand rune saint artifacts, or saint artifacts that were engraved with glory spirits.

“Ha. You really dare to come!” Yan Kong smiled coldly. “I should’ve killed you with a slap outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple? Ha!”

“Hahaha! Senior Brother Yan, you’re being too polite with him. The Radiant Sword Saint is already a dead person, so who will recognize him now?”

“In the current Ancient Barren Domain, who doesn’t know that the Profound Sky Saint Sovereign is the strongest?”

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren. He’ll dominate the entire Ancient Barren Domain sooner or later. Does the Sword Sect want to return to becoming a holy land? Dream on!”

“I’ve seen foolish people, but I’ve never seen such a foolish person. Since he dares to come and court death, we’ll take that fellow’s head, then!” The big sects’ chief disciples had long joined the Profound Sky Sect, and they looked at Lin Yun with killing intent filled in their pupils like Yan Kong.

“What a huge formation.” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“Ha, you’re afraid now? It’s a pity that it’s useless even if you go down on your knees to beg for mercy. Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, you must die today, no matter what!” Yan Kong said coldly, standing at the mountain summit.

“Beg for mercy? I’m here to kill. Today, none of you can leave unscathed.” Lin Yun said calmly.

“Hahaha!” The group was briefly stunned before they started laughing.

A chief disciple laughed, “Senior Brother Yan, he said that none of us can escape?”

“Hahaha!” His words caused everyone in the surroundings to laugh out loud.

Yan Kong snickered, “You better be more worried about yourself and your fellow disciples trapped in the valley. Mu Xueqin is pretty good, and I heard that Jian Jingtian’s daughter is a great beauty. Hahaha!”

Those words made Lin Yun’s pupils flash with a cold light as he glared at Yan Kong.

Seeing Lin Yun’s gaze, Yan Kong said coldly, “None of you are allowed to move. I’ll suppress him today!”

When he finished, the demonic clouds in the sky broke apart and silver moonlight shone on him. The outline of a moon had appeared behind him. Yan Kong was confident that he could quickly deal with Lin Yun alone. Even if Lin Yun wanted to escape, it was impossible with the big sects’ chief disciples here. The Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple was destined to die today, and no one could save him.

“Lin Yun, I’ve wanted to kill you for a long time!” Yan Kong’s face became sinister and appeared before Lin Yun. As his constellation opened up, a silver moon flew out. That was his constellation, a moon that looked like it was created with mercury. He wanted to use his constellation to suppress the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple and repeat the Sword Sect’s tragedy that happened two decades ago.

Pushing his palm out, white clouds flew out from behind the silver moon, and the white clouds were like a curtain that instantly suppressed Lin Yun’s Firmament Sword Intent.

“Kneel!” Yan Kong roared, his palm reaching for Lin Yun’s head. The next moment, a huge collision occurred, and the ground started to tremble violently.

“Too weak.”

“Yan Kong hasn’t even pushed his Profound Sky Canon to the limit, and his sword intent is already suppressed. Lin Yun is only capable of bullying ordinary people.”

“That’s right. His cultivation is nothing before a true genius!”

“His Firmament Sword Intent is suppressed now. Let me see what he can do now!” Everyone mocked, shaking their heads when they saw Lin Yun’s sword aura being suppressed.

But the next moment, everyone was dumbfounded as Lin Yun raised his head and pushed his palm forth. Lin Yun didn’t take a step back when the two palms collided.

“How is this possible?!” Everyone was shocked, and their faces changed.

“Kneel!” Yan Kong flew into a rage upon seeing this, and silver flames started to blaze behind him that soon condensed into a pair of wings. When he flapped his wings, cold flames swept down. It was surprising that Yan Kong grasped the rare Frostfire Intent.

But Lin Yun’s performance wasn’t inferior. A pair of Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him. Sacred flames blazed on every feather, making him look like a massive sun hovering in the air, and the aura he was giving off also began to increase.

As the Golden Crow Wings flapped, the Golden Lotus Sacred Flames swept out and collided with the Chillfrost Sacred Flame. When the two different flames collided, the surroundings within a hundred-mile radius was enveloped in flames.

Under the sea of flames, their palms collided, and they unleashed terrifying auras. This was too terrifying because the radiance released by them could be seen even from a few hundred miles away.

This left the geniuses from the other forces dumbfounded. How was this possible? Yan Kong, who grasped the fifth-grade Frostfire Intent and was at the pinnacle fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm couldn’t take down Lin Yun after suppressing his sword intent? This was simply too unbelievable.

But Lin Yun inwardly roared and summoned the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron from his dragon origin ocean. As a demonic cauldron broke out from his dragon origin ocean in his violet palace, his body was filled with a boundless demonic aura that made his pupils black.

His aura instantly broke through multiple restrictions and reached the height of the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, sending Yan Kong flying under unbelievable gazes.

“How dare you!” Yan Kong’s heart sank when he retreated. As he hovered in the air, he pushed his left palm out.

“Nine Heavenly Falling Moons!” Under his palm, eight beams of moonlight descended from the sky, which made this palm look terrifying. But when his palm was about to fall, Lin Yun folded his Golden Crow Wings, circulating the Golden Crow Saint Rune. The high-grade ghost spirit martial technique from Yan Kong felt like it had struck a mountain.

On the other hand, Lin Yun didn’t move his wings. When he unfolded them, Yan Kong was quickly sent flying away.

As blood dripped from Yan Kong’s lips, Lin Yun raised his hand and pressed down before the former could respond, executing the Azure Dragon Grasp. As a massive dragon claw broke out from the clouds, it flew out with Lin Yun’s palm.

Yan Kong clasped his palms together, wanting to fold his silver wings. But before he could, the Golden Crow Wings were like two blades that sliced off Yan Kong’s wings, causing Yan Kong to let out a miserable scream. His wings had become two bloody halves.

When that dragon claw descended from the sky, the ground cracked, and snow flew around. The scene of Yan Kong being suppressed left everyone dumbfounded.
