Chapter 839 - Dragoncloud Treasury

At this point, the stage had been destroyed. Lin Yun floated in the air as he watched the radiance of his golden dragon push Yu Haotian farther away. Cracks continued to spread out on the surface of Yu Haotian’s body as Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent continued to wreak havoc. Naturally, Yu Haotian couldn’t even handle this when his body was nothing compared to Yan Long’zi’s robust body.

Once Yu Haotian’s body crumbled, he spit up blood all over his clothes.

He didn’t die? Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with killing intent. Yu Haotian must have had something to ensure his safety. It seemed like the Indigomoon Elysium treated Yu Haotian with great importance.

“The outcome has been determined!” The chief judge quickly made the announcement when he sensed Lin Yun’s killing intent. He wanted Lin Yun to know that the fight was over. After all, not even Yu Haotian was allowed to continue attacking Yue Weiwei.

The judge’s resounding voice woke everyone up from their stupor. Only now did they realize that Lin Yun won. No one could believe what happened. After all, everyone assumed that Yu Haotian was going to be the champion again.

At this moment, Lin Yun became the champion and Yu Haotian came in second. Nothing that Yu Haotian did could defeat Lin Yun. Even the Bashe martial soul fell flat in the face of Lin Yun’s attack.

“Legendary! Lin Yun actually stayed undefeated! I feel like I’m dreaming!”

“There’s no way an ordinary dark horse can last until the end. It really feels like a dream that a swordsman from nowhere is standing at the pinnacle of the Ancient Southern Domain.”

“Is the Indigomoon Elysium dumbfounded? I bet they never imagined this outcome.”

“How can we mention the Indigomoon Elysium when we didn’t even expect this? A dark horse from the Great Qin Empire defeated Yu Haotian. If someone heard that before the banquet, they would have laughed!” Everyone from the Indigomoon Elysium was completely dumbfounded and Qing Ruoyou nearly fainted.

“Why him! Why him! Why him!” Qing Ruoyou ripped her veil off as she raged. How could the ant she met in the Skymound City actually become the champion of the Dragoncloud Ranking? In the end, she threw up a mouthful of blood as she lost control of her emotions and fainted.

“Senior sister! Senior sister!”

“Quick, check on senior sister’s condition. If anything happens to her, we’re doomed.” The Indigomoon Elysium’s disciples became nervous when they saw this scene.

“Flower Burial is a monster!” In addition to the Indigomoon Elysium, the remaining overlord forces were also unhappy. After all, the champion had always come from one of them. In the history of the banquet, there had never been a genius who stepped on all nine of the overlord forces. Lin Yun was the first to ever do this.

Pavilion Master Plum and everyone from the Great Qin Empire was dumbfounded as they couldn’t believe what they just heard. Before coming to the banquet, Pavilion Master Plum didn’t even think about the top ten. He only hoped that Lin Yun could make it into the inner ranking, which would also bring fortune and fame to the Sword Firmament Pavilion. However, Lin Yun went above and beyond Pavilion Master Plum’s expectations. His accomplishment was at the level of ancestor Jian Wuming.

Jian Wuming had resources that Lin Yun could only dream of. However, Lin Yun was stronger than Jian Wuming was at his age.

“This is too unbelievable. If the ancestor is still alive, even he wouldn’t be able to believe that there’s such a monster among the new generation,” sighed Pavilion Master Plum.

“Maybe the ancestor expected it. Otherwise, he wouldn't leave the Overlord Sword with the pavilion. The Overlord Sword is akin to a forbidden technique, but Lin Yun successfully cultivated it,” said Elder Luo Feng.

He had a deep impression of Lin Yun. After all, he knew Lin Yun would achieve something extraordinary when he first executed the Overlord Sword. However, Luo Feng’s scope was still too small because he didn’t think that Lin Yun would stand at the peak of the Ancient Southern Domain one day.

“Perhaps.” Pavilion Master Plum’s eyes flickered because Ancestor Jian Wuming was a deity-like figure. Perhaps Jian Wuming really expected a genius like Lin Yun to come one day. Otherwise, leaving the Overlord Sword in the sect was a disaster because a lot of disciples had died from it.

Under everyone’s gaze, Yu Haotian was rescued by an Indigomoon Elysium’s elder who placed a precious fifth-grade pellet in his mouth. Yu Haotian’s martial soul was damaged, and it would take at least six months for him to recover. If he was unlucky, he might never be able to heal. After all, Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent wasn’t that easy to bear.

Lin Yun thought it was a shame that Yu Haotian survived. If he knew that Yu Haotian would have survived his attack, he would have used dragon breath to turn Yu Haotian into ashes. But it didn’t matter anymore. Since he already defeated Yu Haotian, it would be even easier to defeat Yu Haotian in the future.

Then, Lin Yun’s golden dragon projection roared and devoured Yu Haotian’s profound amber aura. This startled everyone in the top 100.

All of them had a dragon projection, so they were feeling uneasy. Then, dragon aura from everyone’s dragon projections was forcibly extracted and added to Lin Yun’s dragon king projection.

“What’s going on?”

“The dragon aura in my dragon projection disappeared. Damn it, what’s going on?”

“Isn’t it too unfair to extract our dragon aura?!” All of the geniuses in the top 100 were mad.

“Damn it!” When Yu Haotian woke up and saw this scene, his face instantly turned black. He already expected that the champion would possess the complete dragon aura. All of the dragon aura was supposed to be his, yet all he could do now was watch Lin Yun take everything. How could he not feel terrible? In fact, he felt so terrible that he wanted to die. At least everything would come to an end if he died.

“You need to endure this. A new era is coming and the Heavenly Path is opening. You still have an opportunity,” said the Indigomoon Elysium’s sect master upon sensing Yu Haotian’s emotions.

When Lin Yun’s dragon king projection devoured all of the dragon aura, its pupils shined brightly and looked vivid. When the dragon swept a glance at the ten judges, they even felt terror in their eyes. After all, this scene had never happened in the past banquets, which caught them by surprise.

“Something’s not right.” The chief judge wore a grave expression. He could sense that something was going to happen. Suddenly, a terrifying roar echoed throughout the nine heavens. The shockwave from the roar forced all the spectators to hit the ground.

Lin Yun raised his head and looked at the starry sky. A colossal azure divine dragon revealed itself in the distant starry sky. Lin Yun could sense that it was trying to find the Profound Amber Realm’s location.

The divine dragon projection! Lin Yun instantly thought of the divine dragon projection that he saw before. After the dragon searched for a long time, its gaze fell onto Lin Yun. More accurately, it was looking at the dragon king projection behind Lin Yun.

As if there was a connection between them, the Nine Dragon Lake suddenly exploded and formed a massive vortex. The vortex was filled with mysterious energy and a door opening at its center.

“The Dragoncloud Treasury!” The chief judge exclaimed as his eyes lit up.

“That’s the legendary Dragoncloud Treasury!” The spectators lost all rationale as they charged towards the Nine Dragon Lake. Aside from the participants who made it through the points round, everyone was sent backwards and were heavily injured.

“The legend is actually true!” Yue Weiwei exclaimed in shock as she appeared next to Lin Yun. When she turned to look at Lin Yun, she discovered that he was blankly staring at the sky. The starry sky was slowly disappearing and the divine dragon had already left.

“Aren’t you curious about the opportunities in the Dragoncloud Treasury?” Yue Weiwei asked with narrowed eyes.

“I’m more curious where that path leads to…” Lin Yun said softly.

“That’s a Heavenly Path, a path to an endless battlefield,” said Yue Weiwei.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
