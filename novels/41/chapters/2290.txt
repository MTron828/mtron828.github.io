Chapter 2291 - My Sword Is Sharp!

Lin Yun didn’t hold back. His saint radiance was as bright as the sun. He soared to the sky and faced the fifth-stage Saint Lord’s palm head-on under the latter’s shocked gaze, shattering the latter’s dipper energy.

“H-How is this possible?” The fifth-stage Saint Lord threw out a mouthful of blood and looked at Lin Yun with shock. Even if Lin Yun reached the Saint Realm, he was only a second-stage Saint Lord, and the three stages differed. He couldn’t accept that he lost so easily, even before Lin Yun used his sword intent. He threw out another mouthful of blood and took a few steps back. He was too heavily injured and couldn’t fight any longer.

Lin Yun inwardly sneered as he looked at the fifth-stage Saint Lord’s retreating figure. Even before he became a Saint, he could heavily injure the Ying River King by relying on his sword intent. He had transformed after becoming a Saint, and he would have made a breakthrough in vain if he couldn’t injure his opponent. If the fifth-stage Saint Lord had gone all out, he might not have been able to injure his opponent with a palm, but his opponent gave him an opportunity because he was too careless.

“Dipper energy?! Flower Burial reached the Saint Realm? Wasn’t he a Quasi-Saint in the Heavenly Void?”

“This is a little too unbelievable. He’s only a second-stage Saint Lord, but he injured a Saint Lord of the older generation with just one palm. Just how strong is his foundation?”

“He must have cultivated a powerful cultivation technique, or this would make no sense.”

“Don’t forget that he also has the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, and I believe it now.” Everyone in the surroundings was a Saint and naturally had some eyesight. They were shocked, and some of them wavered. But the Astral River Saint Sovereign, fighting with three Saint Sovereigns, was more shocked.

“A second-stage Saint Lord? How did he manage to do it…” The Astral River Saint Sovereign didn’t expect this scene. He was fortunate that the three Saint Sovereigns he fought were more shocked than him, or he would suffer heavy injuries from being distracted in a fight.

“A young hero, indeed. But what’s with those images?” The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign not only noticed the fight but even the golden images that everyone else had neglected.

“It looks like the Radiant Sword Saint has an heir!”

“Hahaha! Tian Xuanzi might not be able to rule the Eastern Desolation now! Kill them!” The blood of everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain began to boil after seeing Lin Yun defeat a fifth-stage Saint Lord. They initially thought they were fighting because of a Saint Sovereign’s orders, but this greatly raised their morale.

“Damn it! We have to kill him today!” The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign became anxious. The three holy lands already held a great advantage but lost in morale instead.

“Kill him!”

“Ignore those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain and kill him!”

When everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain saw this, they did their best to hold back the Saints that were from the three holy lands. The situation suddenly became chaotic, with hundreds of Saints fighting with countless constellations appearing, causing the entire region to tremble.

“His name will spread throughout the world.” Liu Yunlan didn’t move as he observed the fight, and his gaze became complicated after seeing Lin Yun’s strength. After today, Lin Yun’s name would spread throughout the Kunlun Realm, officially announcing Flower Burial’s return.

After Lin Yun inflicted heavy injuries on a fifth-stage Saint Lord, he was surrounded by eight Saint Elders. But they weren’t even fifth-stage Saint Lords. They might have an advantage in numbers, but they couldn’t pose any threat to Lin Yun.

Lin Yun sneered, “Is this the best the three holy lands can offer?”

The Saint Lords were heavily injured with just one exchange, shocking everyone.

“How dare you!”

“What arrogance!” Three people came over. They were all fifth-stage Saint Lords.

“Great!” Lin Yun charged over with his long hair fluttering in the wind. They weren’t weaker than the previous fifth-stage Saint Lord and were even more powerful as they joined hands. So they dashed forth when they saw how arrogant Lin Yun was and unleashed their attacks.

“Sun-Moon Sword!”

“Heavenly Flame Destruction!”

“Divine Cloud Slash!” The three executed dragon spirit martial techniques without holding back.

“Great!” Lin Yun’s eyes coldly flashed as the Flower Burial Sword flew out from his chest and executed the Divine Firefly Sword. He had long reached the deification stage with the third section of the Divine Firefly Sword. When he swung his sword, he exhibited the entirety of its profundity.

As water splashed, a river of time-space appeared around Lin Yun, containing his sword intent. With a gentle wave, the three incoming attacks were blocked. But that wasn’t all, as eighteen sword rays flew out. That wasn’t the true horror. Those sword rays contained the profundity of the Divine Firefly Sword, the profundity that belonged to Lin Yun. A scream was heard as a fifth-stage Saint Lord had his arm severed.

Stepping on the river, Lin Yun fused with the river and his sword aura rose. The one clashing with him head-on was sent flying away.

“Quick, leave!”

“That fellow is going to draw his sword!” The remaining people’s faces became pale as they retreated without any fighting spirits left.

Everyone observing this was so shocked that they were already dumbfounded. Lin Yun’s previous performance was enough to shock them, but after Lin Yun drew his sword, he became even more terrifying. Someone exclaimed, “I have long heard that Lin Yun is a prodigy swordsman, and it looks like the rumors aren’t fake.”

“Who can compete with him in the past and next five hundred years in regards to the sword?”

“Don’t forget Skysolute City.”

“Well, that makes sense. But I have a feeling that Flower Burial isn’t afraid.”

“Withered Tree Coming To Life!”

“Rising Sun!”

“Polar Opposite!” Lin Yun’s sword rays flew out as he performed the Divine Firefly Sword, soon forcing the three fifth-stage Saint Lords into a dead-end. They were covered in blood. But just when Lin Yun was going to slay these three five-stage Saint Lords, a lightning bolt descended, tearing space into two and struck Lin Yun with no room to escape.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“It’s the Myriad Lightning Sect’s Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord!”

“For him to make a move now, he has hidden himself deep.”

“Isn’t he a sixth-stage Saint Lord? Isn’t it too shameless for him to launch a sneak attack?”

“That’s a Golden Pill Saint Lord, we’re talking about!” Everyone’s face changed, never expecting that there was a sixth-stage Saint Lord in the dark. Sixth-stage Saint Lords have condensed their daos into a golden pill. This was a huge transformation in strength when compared to the fifth-stage Saint Lords. A sixth-stage Saint Lord could easily kill one at the fifth stage because their daos could unleash a terrifying might.

“Die!” The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord began forming seals as the might of lightning around him increased. A violent lightning explosion left thousands of holes in the ground within a thousand miles.

Lin Yun’s reaction was swift, but he was still caught up in the explosion and was only able to stabilize himself after he was sent flying a thousand meters away.

“Big Brother Lin!” The faces of Ji Zixi, Li Feibai, and the others changed when they saw this scene.

But Lin Yun easily resolved the lightning with a gentle spin of the Flower Burial Sword. Standing on a pile of stones, he smiled, “Is this the best a sixth-stage Saint Lord can do? Sneak attacks?”

Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind, showing that he wasn’t injured.

“H-How is this possible?!”

“The attack of a sixth-stage Saint Lord couldn’t injure him?”

“The robe that he’s wearing isn’t ordinary!”

“It looks like the legendary Azure Saint Cloth, but the method of creating it has been long lost…” Everyone was surprised.

The Heavenly Dust Saint Lord squinted before he circulated his golden pill. His daos were imprinted in the thirty-six layers of heaven with golden lightning bolts descending as they intertwined and overlapped.

Lin Yun kept unleashing sword rays but was still caught in the explosions. But the Azure Saint Cloth would release a radiance each time that knocked the aftermath back. The ground collapsed, but Lin Yun didn’t have to worry about suffering heavy injuries even if those lightning bolts struck him.

As for the shockwaves, he didn’t have to worry about them. When he saw that the Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord was beginning to form seals, thunderclouds rumbled in the sky with intertwining crimson runes. The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord was setting up an array to suppress Lin Yun.

“It looks like you’re having a good time. Let me play with you, then.” Lin Yun soared and appeared before the Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord with a few flickers.

“I’ve been waiting for you!” When the Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord saw this scene, murderous intent gushed out from his eyes as he wore a sinister smile. A golden pill appeared behind him with a golden radiance shooting out like a domain that enveloped it.

“Brat, you don’t know how powerful a sixth-stage Saint Lord is. Since you dare to come, then die!” The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord sneered. This was the golden pill domain that could restrict everything.

“My sword is sharp,” Lin Yun said as he raised his brow. His eyes became golden with a massive sword intent spreading out, causing the golden pill domain to shatter. A righteous aura also swept out as Lin Yun released his Divine Light Sword Intent.

When the Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord raised his head to see Lin Yun’s golden eyes, his face drastically changed.
