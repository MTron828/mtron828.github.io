Chapter 942 - Quietly Bidding For One’s Time

Entering a path with more demonic beasts into the Ashes Mountain Range, Lin Yun wore a hood and his figure started flashing in the forest. Along the way, he could see higher realms’ geniuses cleaning up the surrounding demonic beasts.

After they were done hunting the surrounding demonic beasts, they could see higher realms’ spiritualists leaving behind spiritual runes on the ground. When they were done, the spiritual runes they left behind started linking up together with a light flashing through the air before they fused into the surrounding atmosphere.

“Spiritual array?” Lin Yun was surprised as he looked from the top of the tree. Those spiritualists who could set up and control the array were at least in the fourth grade. Spiritual arrays were different from diagrams. Spiritual diagrams were a lot simpler because one person could create and use a high graded spiritual diagram. But it would be a lot more complicated for arrays because not even ordinary fourth-grade spiritualists had the ability to do that.

Furthermore, Lin Yun could tell that the grade of this spiritual array wasn’t low just by looking at this scale. It looks like Mo Yan had recruited a lot of people this time from the six higher realms. This also meant that it would be a lot harder for Lin Yun to obtain the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s beast core.

Then, Lin Yun quietly followed behind the spiritualists and bypassed many segments. This made Lin Yun shocked because the attainment of those spiritualists was rather high the more he examined the array. Lin Yun could tell that this array was rather ingenious as it had relied on the momentum of the mountain range.

If this could catch the Gold-furred Demonic Ape by surprise, Mo Yan probably wouldn’t need to pay any price to kill this third soul Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast.

An hour later, Lin Yun followed the group to a spacious valley. This was the Ashes Valley, the territory of the Gold-furred Demonic Ape. The entire ground was scorched and filled with fire spiritual energy in the atmosphere. At the border of the valley, there were about two to three hundred geniuses from the various higher realms and they were all in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

The scale of this formation had even left Lin Yun shocked. Hugging onto Lil’ Red, Lin Yun gently leapt and quietly approached. When he got close, he could see three people leading the party. Although there were many higher realms’ geniuses here, the huge party was led by three people.

The one at the centre wore black clothes with a flaming emblem on his back. He was naturally Blazeyang Realm’s leader, Mo Yan. The one on his left wore simple grey clothes and spiritual runes vaguely enveloping him. Lin Yun could instantly tell that this person was a fourth-grade spiritualist.

This made Lin Yun frown. According to the information from Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong, this should be the leader of Profound Spiritual Realm, Mu Ziyi. Fourth-grade spiritualists could be comparable to Heavenly Soul Realm experts, to begin with. The more fourth-grade spiritual runes they grasped, the stronger they would be. Since this person could control the spiritual array, this meant that he had grasped at least ten-odd fourth-grade spiritual runes.

The one on the right had a robust figure with a terrifying height of over two meters. Paired with his robust figure, he looked like a small mountain. Lin Yun couldn’t sense much origin energy fluctuation coming from this person as this person looked like someone who purely cultivated his physique. This should be the leader of the Demonic Constellation Realm, Wu Mu.

“Young Master Mu, can we move now?” Mo Yan smiled while looking at Mu Ziyi.

Mu Ziyi nodded his head before he gently patted on his interspatial pouch, retrieving an armour before handing it to Wu Mu. He was truly worthy of being a spiritualist. After all, defensive dao artifact were rarer than offensive dao artifacts. So it wasn’t something that anyone could take out easily.

But that wasn’t all. After Mu Ziyi retrieved the defensive dao artifact, he took out more transcendent cosmic artifacts and equipped them on Wu Mu. When he was done, Wu Mu’s robust figure looked like a humanoid stronghold with a powerful pressure coming from him. The dao artifact and cosmic artifacts seemed to be connected with spiritual runes which formed into a small spiritual array on his body.

“These people are really prepared!” Lin Yun soon figured out what they were planning. They must be trying to let Wu Mu rely on the dao artifact and cosmic artifacts to hold the Gold-furred Demonic Ape back. This would greatly decrease their losses, not to mention that they could use the spiritual array enveloping this mountain to suppress the demonic ape before having Mo Yan kill it.

So it was probably in the bag for them to kill the Gold-furred Demonic Ape if there were no accidents. This was the higher realms’ foundation which had completely refreshed Lin Yun’s view on the higher realms. But this was also good news to him because it would be dangerous for him and Lil’ Red to face the Gold-furred Demonic Ape by himself.

Monarch demonic beasts were terrifying, to begin with. Not to mention that they were corroded by the demonic aura in the Heavenly Path throughout the year. With these people around, he could just wait for them to deal with the Gold-furred Demonic Ape before making his move.

“Let’s start!” Mo Yan sneered coldly as all the higher realms’ geniuses behind him started splitting up.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Meanwhile, Wu Mu soared into the sky and revealed his aura publicly. As a ferocious aura started pouring out, the dao artifact and cosmic artifacts on his body became crimson. This made Mu Ziyi surprised before he smiled, “The Demonic Constellation Realm’s bloodline is really terrifying. Their aura is no different from a wild beast. So no wonder their physiques are so strong.”

“Alright. The show is starting now. Young Master Mu, it’s up to you next,” said Mo Yan.

“Haha, don’t worry about it. My Constellation Dragonlocking Array can perfectly make use of the momentum of this mountain range. It won’t have a problem facing the Gold-furred Demonic Ape even if it can’t suppress it,” said Mu Ziyi confidently.

Just when Mo Yan was about to speak, the ground started trembling violently with a blazing aura sweeping out with a hill slowly approaching from afar.

“The Gold-furred Demonic Ape!” Lin Yun took in a cold breath and was deeply shocked. The three hundred meters Gold-furred Demonic Ape was shining brightly from its massive body and was covered in golden fur. It had a pair of sharp fangs with golden flames blazing in the depth of its pupils.

When two dazzling flames shot out from its pupils, this made Wu Mu’s movements become a lot stiffer with a powerful aura enveloping this entire space. Even if the aura coming from Wu Mu was terrifying, he was instantly immobilized under this aura.

This is the pressure of a monarch demonic beast? Looking from afar, this demonic beast was truly powerful and it was no longer at the level of higher realms’ geniuses could compete with.

Aside from Mo Yan who had high attainment in the flame intent, even Wu Mu and Mu Ziyi couldn’t move when facing this demonic beast. Suddenly the massive golden figure suddenly jumped and grabbed onto Wu Mu, wanting to tear him into two pieces.

Right at this moment, Wu Mu’s dao artifact and cosmic artifacts shone brightly with the spiritual array Mu Ziyi had engraved on it starting to buzz. So no matter how the Gold-furred Demonic Ape tried, it wasn’t able to tear Wu Mu in half.

The Gold-furred Demonic Ape unleashed a roar and bare its fangs. But seeing that it couldn’t tear Wu Mu apart, the Gold-furred Demonic Ape then grabbed onto Wu Mu and threw him towards a mountain. When Wu Mu clashed with the mountain, the entire mountain snapped and started to crumble.

Wu Mu couldn’t even put up a resistance against the Gold-furred Demonic Ape and was completely being crushed one-sidedly.

“Mu Ziyi, quick!” Wu Mu yelled after he was thrown against the mountain. This made Lin Yun fall into deep thoughts because Wu Mu’s physique was a little too exaggerated. If it was an ordinary genius being thrown in this manner, they would’ve already been turned into a pile of meat.

“Constellation Dragonlocking Array!” Mu Ziyu finally made his move as he hovered in mid-air with spiritual runes appearing around him. The split second when he formed his seals, the clouds were torn apart with starlight forming into pillars that fell onto the already arranged segments.

Boundless astral energy began to circulate with the massive spiritual array on the ground being activated and formed into a massive painting. This made Lin Yun narrow his eyes as he could see the poisonous fog enveloping the Ashes Mountain Range being gathered together.

Along with a huge sound, the poisonous fog was condensed into a demonic bird, casting a shadow down half the valley when it spread its wings apart. This forced the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s monarch aura to start to retreat under the demonic bird’s terrifying aura.

Wu Mu took this opportunity to charge over and could finally land on the Gold-furred Demonic Ape without the restriction of the monarch aura.

“Move out!” Mo Yan turned into a flame and charged forth with its boundless origin energy manifesting into a flaming beast with its palm descending down on the Gold-furred Demonic Ape.

“Blazing Sunbreaking Palm!” Mo Yan also released all the power he had been accumulating. When his palm landed on the Gold-furred Demonic Ape, it had left a huge hole on its body.

Under this palm, the Gold-furred Demonic Ape was forced to take several steps back. But this wasn’t all as all the higher realms’ geniuses had already scattered out and ambushed in the surroundings. They all flew into the sky and rained their attacks down on the Gold-furred Demonic Ape.

This caused an earth-shattering explosion to echo in the valley with all sorts of phenomena appearing. Facing the siege of the higher realms’ geniuses, especially with Wu Mu, Mo Yan, and Mu Ziyi joining forces together, even the Gold-furred Demonic Ape no longer had its prestige when he suppressed Wu Mu.

But the Gold-furred Demonic Ape swept its glance around before clashing with Mo Yan head-on. This made Mo Yan throw out a mouthful of blood with the flames enveloping him dissipating and he was sent flying back.

Taking advantage of this, the Gold-furred Demonic Ape looked into the distance before stopping on Mu Ziyi. Although the Gold-furred Demonic ape was a demonic beast, it had great intelligence and knew who was the key to resolving this situation.

But just when he sent Mo Yan flying and was prepared to shake off Wu Mu before heading towards Mu Ziyi, Mo Yan who was sent flying away charged back once again.

“Hehe. You want to force me back? Not so easy! Now, you can get back to where you come from!” Mo Yan’s face became sinister as the flame intent around him which had dimmed down regathered once more and threw his palm out.

The Gold-furred Demonic Ape tried to block this attack, but it had lost its balance from the impact and fell onto the ground.

“A golden chance!” Wu Mu’s eyes lit up and jumped over, executing his secret technique and his body started to swell up, wanting to suppress the Gold-furred Demonic Ape. All of this had happened in the blink of an eye.

Mu Ziyu manipulated the spiritual array from afar to suppress the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s aura while Wu Mu relied on the artifacts and his physique to tangle the demonic beast. As for Mo Yan who was the strongest among them, he was naturally responsible for inflicting injuries on the beast.

As for the other higher realms’ geniuses, they were responsible for exhausting the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s vitality. If this carried on, the Gold-furred Demonic Ape would be exhausted to death sooner or later.

On the tree, Lin Yun and Lil’ Red were watching in the dark as they waited for the right opportunity to make a move.
