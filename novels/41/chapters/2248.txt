Chapter 2249 - Don’t Be So Sure!

Lin Yun’s laughter continued to echo throughout the valley as everyone watched Lin Yun with shock.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“That’s the Heavenly Dragon Lord?”

“Isn’t the Radiant’s lineage a little too unfathomable?”

“I’m afraid even a Sword Immortal can’t do any better than him.” Even after a long time had passed, everyone was still shocked as they looked at the mountains that were split apart by Lin Yun’s sword. This was shocking because it stretched to a thousand miles away, looking like it had stretched to the other side of heaven.

“How can I possibly compete with him,” Qu Wushuang sighed, shaking his head.

“Young Master Wushuang, do you want to chase after him?” A Saint Lord of the Divine Dao Pavilion asked. Not many dared to say that, aside from the holy lands and a few others, at this moment. After all, god knows how many casualties were there in the valley because of Lin Yun, and there was no way a third-stage Saint Lord could stop him.

Only fourth-stage Saint Lords might be able to defeat him, but even so, it was another question if they could force him to remain. But fourth-stage Saint Lords were trump cards of the various holy lands, and they were meant to compete for the divine flames. So it was too early to reveal them now.

“We won’t get involved.” Qu Wushuang soon made up his mind. He didn’t find any meaning in that because it wasn’t worth offending Lin Yun if you couldn’t kill him. Just imagining having Lin Yun as an enemy was terrifying enough.

“Let them go. We won’t get involved,” Qu Wushuang smiled as he left with everyone from the Divine Dao Pavilion.

The Heavenly Flame Sect, Ming Cult, and Myriad Lightning Sect had no choice but to chase after Lin Yun. After all, the three holy lands had already allied with Tian Xuanzi, and everyone knew that Tian Xuanzi wouldn't turn up during such a wonderful opportunity since the Radiant Sword Saint was about to undergo his tribulation.

The three holy lands have already placed their stakes, so they were destined to become enemies with Lin Yun, whether they liked it or not. Even without the Divine Blood Fruit, they would have to find ways to ensure Lin Yun’s death in the Heavenly Void.

“After him!” Huang Jingyu and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord gathered up with Liu Yunlan before they made a decision.

“Young Master, I’m afraid that even a fourth-stage Saint Lord will have trouble suppressing Lin Yun, based on the strength he had just exhibited,” a Ming Cult’s Saint Lord said. Based on Lin Yun's strength, even fourth-stage Saint Lords might not be able to get rid of him. To guarantee success, they must send out three fourth-grade Saint Lords without holding back.

Huang Jingyu knew what they were worried about, so he said, “Flower Burial is more valuable than the divine flames, and there’s no better opportunity to kill him now while he’s in the Heavenly Void. Don’t hold back; we can’t let him leave with the Divine Blood Fruit so easily.”

His last sentence convinced the Myriad Lightning Sect and Heavenly Flame Sect. No one knew if the divine flames existed, but the Divine Blood Fruit was something they could see.

Lin Yun was carrying Li Feibai as they traveled tens of thousands of miles.

“Flower Burial, let me down.” Li Feibai said with her face pale. She was weak and no longer that domineering person who released that Sovereign Constellation earlier.

“Your condition doesn’t seem right. Young…Lady Li,” Lin Yun said.

Li Feibai felt ashamed and didn’t dare to look Lin Yun straight in the eyes. After all, she sounded too confident when she commented that Lin Yun was ordinary and that he should just watch from the mountain. Ultimately, she had to be saved by this ‘ordinary’ Quasi-Saint. She had never felt so embarrassed before. She furiously asked, “Why didn’t you tell me you’re so strong?”

“You didn’t give me the opportunity to, and you told me to watch from the side,” Lin Yun smiled bitterly.

"You're still quibbling!" Li Feibai was so angry that a sickly blush appeared on her pale face as if she would faint at any time.

Seeing her condition, Lin Yun knew that she meant well. So he could only let her throw her temper.

“You can leave now and not have to worry about me. The Divine Blood Fruit is in your hands, so they won’t come after me. I don’t want to be a burden to you.” Li Feibai knew she was in the wrong, so she could only put up a strong front to protect the last hint of her dignity.

Lin Yun raised his head and glanced into the distance. After his face changed, he soon decided to grab Li Feibai’s shoulder.

“What are you trying to do?” Li Feibai struggled, but she couldn’t stop Lin Yun. Before she could react, Lin Yun grabbed her shoulder and dragged her over.

As Li Feibai exclaimed, Lin Yun dragged her before him and made her sit down. Before she could speak, he touched her back and injected his blue dragon aura into her body. The blue dragon aura contained powerful vitality and could also cure all poisons. Lin Yun had been poisoned before but relied on the Blue Dragon Bone to resolve it. So he reckoned that it should be effective against the Blood Poison. Even if there weren’t any effects, the vitality in the blue dragon aura should help her restore to her peak state.

“What are you trying to do…?” Li Feibai exclaimed.

“Don’t speak. If you hadn’t snatched the Divine Blood Fruit, you wouldn’t have to exhaust so much of your saint energy and allow the Blood Poison to return. So I have no reason to abandon you. Righteous Saint Lords might not do anything to you, but the Heavenly Void isn’t as calm as you think,” Lin Yun said.

Very quickly, Li Feibai no longer spoke. She was amazed to discover that her saint energy was recovering at an alarming speed. Also, the Blood Poison, which gave her a headache, dissipated under the blue aura.

She instantly realized that it was the blue dragon aura and finally realized that Lin Yun could help her resolve the Blood Poison. Lin Yun had suggested it before in the woods, but she was aloof and didn’t take him seriously. Now that she thought about it; she was too full of herself and wouldn’t be in this state if she had heeded his advice.

“That’s enough. I can deal with the remaining Blood Poison myself.” Li Feibai was embarrassed to let Lin Yun continue any further. After all, Lin Yun had just undergone a battle, and his exhaustion was already huge. Now that he was treating her with the blue dragon aura, Lin Yun would take longer to recover from exhaustion.

Lin Yun said, “Since I have already made a move, don’t think too much about it. Blood Poison isn’t as troublesome as you think.”

A few minutes later, Lin Yun heaved a breath after resolving the Blood Poison that was within Li Feibai’s body. When Li Feibai turned around, she discovered that Lin Yun’s forehead was covered in sweat, and his face was pale. Lin Yun had exhausted even more of his strength to treat her injuries.

“Thank you,” Li Feibai said. Now that things have come this far, she had no choice but to thank Lin Yun.

“Don’t worry about it.” Lin Yun accepted her gratitude and took out the Divine Blood Fruit. He then plucked some leaves and handed them over. Then he said, “According to our agreement, the leaves are yours.”

Li Feibai was ashamed, looking at the leaves. She was too embarrassed to take the leaves, so she only took one of them and said, “I only need one.”

“Well, fine with me,” Lin Yun smiled as he kept the remaining six leaves. He couldn’t use the Divine Blood Fruit, but the leaves were perfect to increase his cultivation.

“You have given me a huge surprise, and I take back my previous evaluation of you. The Radiant’s lineage is as strong as rumored,” Li Feibai said seriously.

Raising his head, Lin Yun looked at Li Feibai, and said, “The Eight Imperial Clans aren’t bad, either.”

He was speaking the truth because he was shocked when he saw Li Feibai bringing out the Sovereign Constellation.

Li Feibai looked at Lin Yun, but she couldn’t help laughing after recalling how domineering he was earlier. She said, “That doesn’t sound like something you’d say, Flower Burial. You’re pretty adorable.”

She heard Lin Yun saying that he was the moon in the clouds and an immortal. She looked at Lin Yun with shining eyes and said in an ambiguous tone, “I didn’t believe it when people called you the Holy Maiden Killer, but I believe it now.”

Lin Yun looked at Li Feibai, and smiled, “You better not believe it because I’m destined to be a man that you will never get.”

“Ha, you’re confident in yourself.” But just when Li Feibai was going to continue further, her face suddenly changed because she sensed a powerful mental energy sweeping over that even gave her a huge pressure. That mental energy belonged to a fourth-grade Saint Lord, the Spiritual Sea Stage Saint Lord. They had far surpassed the Yin-Yang stage and have manifested a spiritual sea in their violet palace.

After reaching the fourth-stage, the Saint Lord would transform. Judging from the mental energy of this Saint Lord, this person was at least at the pinnacle of the fourth-stage. But when she raised her head and saw that there wasn’t a change in Lin Yun’s expression, she had a bad feeling and said, “Flower Burial, you have already discovered it?!”

When she saw that Lin Yun wasn’t replying, Li Feibai confirmed that Lin Yun had already sensed that a fourth-stage Saint Lord was after them when he was treating her. Despite that, he still decided to save her first.

“It’s time for us to split up. The Divine Blood Fruit is in my hands, so they won’t do anything to you,” Lin Yun smiled as he patted his hands together.

“Why?” Li Feibai was baffled.

“That’s because I have to thank you. The Divine Blood Fruit is important to me and is one of my two objectives here. Without your help, I couldn’t have obtained the Divine Blood Fruit,” Lin Yun smiled. As soon as he was done, he turned around and soared to the sky, leaving behind Li Feibai, who was dumbfounded.

Lin Yun left too decisively, as though he was saying that he wasn’t something she could obtain. Li Feibai furiously muttered to herself, “Do I not have any charm?”

An hour later, Lin Yun discovered a smear of light in front of him that was swiftly expanding. It was a flaming skull, which Lin Yun punched. He knew that his enemies were here. When his punch landed on the skull, it felt like he was punching a mountain, and the skull was unbelievably tough.

The backlash sent Lin Yun a few hundred meters back. When he flew back, he drew his sword in mid-air, empowering it with Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent; he finally severed the flaming skull into two.

“Flower Burial, what a powerful sword intent.” As flames spread, a fourth-stage Saint Elder of the Heavenly Flame Sect appeared and stood in Lin Yun’s way.

This person was known as the Crow Shot Saint Lord in the Heavenly Flame Sect, and he wasn’t an ordinary fourth-stage Saint Lord. He had long reached the pinnacle of the fourth-stage and had also practiced a dragon spirit cultivation technique.

With a holy land’s inheritance, he was far stronger than a Saint Lord from the ordinary forces and was giving off a powerful pressure.

Two other figures were quickly approaching behind. They were the Saint Elders from the Ming Cult and Myriad Lightning Sect.

Lin Yun rapidly began to process his thoughts, trying to figure a way out. From their exchange earlier, he finally knew the difference between himself and a fourth-stage Saint Lord. The difference was too great, and he had no odds of winning if he clashed head-on.

But it wouldn’t be easy for him to leave because there were two others. If he used the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear, he might be able to catch one by surprise and inflict heavy injuries on them. But he would also be heavily injured, and it would be even harder for him to escape.

“The Fallen God Valley!” When Lin Yun’s thoughts were processed, Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded.

“Hand over the Divine Blood Fruit; you can keep the saint leaves. You’re the Heavenly Dragon Lord appointed by the Empress. There is no need for us to take it too far,” the Crow Shot Saint Lord said, stroking his beard as his hair fluttered in the wind.

But when he spoke out, the two other Saint Elders were already less than a thousand miles away.

Looking down on Lin Yun, the Crow Shot Saint Lord said, “You can’t escape!”

“Don’t be so sure about that!” Under the shocked gaze of the Crow Shot Saint Lord, Lin Yun charged over with the Flower Burial Sword in his hand.
