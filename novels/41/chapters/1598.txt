Chapter 1599 - Divine Tortoise Transformation

The Sword Sect established its sect with swords, while the Heavenly Blade Pavilion established its sect with blades. Before the Profound Sky Sect rose, the Heavenly Blade Pavilion was the Sword Sect’s greatest rival. In the Ancient Barren Domain, the Sword Sect was the strongest in the sword, and the Heavenly Blade Pavilion was the strongest in terms of the blade.

Mu Chuan once told him that the existing powerful sects in the Ancient Barren Domain all had an ancient force supporting them. The fact that the Heavenly Blade Pavilion hadn’t declined after all these years was enough to prove it.

“See the leader of that party?” Mu Xueqin said beside Lin Yun. “That person is the strongest Golden Generation genius of the Heavenly Blade Pavilion, Xiao Kui. He already grasped the Firmament Blade Intent two years ago, and he’s a ruthless person.”

“Xiao Kui…” Lin Yun followed Mu Xueqin’s gaze and saw a grey-robed youth beside several Samsara Edict Realm geniuses. He had rough skin despite his young age, and one could tell that he had undergone a lot from his face. Furthermore, he had a pair of sharp eyes. He could sense that Xiao Kui had a powerful blade intent in his body, and his cultivation was at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

“I heard that he has reached the ninth stage in the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s Heavenly Origin Blade Technique. This is a terrifying high-grade ghost spirit martial technique. If he reaches the Samsara Edict Realm and completes the blade technique, it can become a dragon spirit martial technique!” Mu Xueqin continued to whisper. “Remember to be careful if you run into him.”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

With surprise flashing through his pupils, Lin Yun nodded his head. It might be troublesome if he faced a high-grade ghost spirit blade technique before his improvement in the Carefree 9 Swords.

While Lin Yun was examining Xiao Kui, two gazes also fell on him. They came from Xiao Kui and Nangong Ze. As Nangong Ze looked at Lin Yun, he whispered in Xiao Kui’s ears.

Xiao Kui fell into deep thoughts upon hearing Nangong Ze’s words. When he examined Lin Yun, a sharp light flashed across his pupils that streaked across the distance between them. Lin Yun didn’t move, but he circulated the sword souls on his forehead and resolved that blade intent.

“Interesting.” Xiao Kui smiled. “You’re right. This person wasn’t just lucky to defeat Huang Xuan, and he’ll only be stronger now. But he’s still tender and shouldn’t have come to the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Let’s go.”

The Heavenly Blade Pavilion and Sword Sect ran into each other, and their Samsara Edict Realm elders nodded at each other before they brushed by and disappeared into Heavenly Barren City.

When the surrounding geniuses saw the two powerful sects bumping into each other, flames were blazing in their pupils. With the Sword Sect and Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s arrival, this became a sign that the Ancient Barren Battlefield, which was held once every two decades, had gone into a countdown.

Under Chen Lei’s lead, the Sword Sect’s party entered the Sword Sect’s branch in Heavenly Barren City. He told everyone not to cause trouble before the Ancient Barren Battlefield opened. The Sword Sect was strong, but Heavenly Barren City had all kinds of people, and no one could be sure that someone would dare to make a move against the powerful sect’s disciples.

After several days of travel, Lin Yun was somewhat exhausted and was planning to find a room to rest. Meanwhile, Mu Qingqing was organizing a group to stroll around the city, but Lin Yun rejected her with a smile.

Returning to his room, Lin Yun sat down and meditated. Half an hour later, he let out a breath, and all the exhaustion in his pupils disappeared.

“Fourth stage in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon and fifth stage in the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. The sword cannon is enough for now, but the sword sutra is a little slow. It’s a pity I don’t have any resources with me right now.” Lin Yun muttered, scratching his head.

Nightscape enveloped the sky outside the window, but the Heavenly Barren City was brightly lit. Heavenly Barren City was close to the border of the Ancient Barren Domain and wasn’t under any forces' jurisdiction. This place normally flourished because it was located at the intersection between several domains. Now that the Ancient Barren Battlefield was about to open, the popularity of this city reached a new height.

There were many places to stroll in the city, and some treasures that came from the Ancient Barren Battlefield could be found there. Aside from that, there was also an auction house, chambers of commerce, an arena, and many other places.

Lin Yun had no interest in them but came before the table and took out the tortoise shell. The tortoise shell was covered with complicated runes, and one could sense a faint fluctuation if one clearly focused on it. But the fluctuation was vague, and it was hard for him to grasp the exact information. This meant he had to use the last Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood that he left behind, but he had no idea how to use it.

“I should go and ask Senior Brother Mu about it.” Lin Yun kept the tortoise shell and came to Mu Chuan’s room.

When he told Mu Chuan his intention and showed him the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood, Mu Chuan was surprised, “You sure you’re not going to keep this for your tribulation?”

“I’m sure.” Lin Yun nodded.

Mu Chuan fell into deep thoughts as he toyed with the tortoise shell, “The Divine Tortoise Transformation is only a part of the Black Tortoise’s inheritance. The true inheritance is divided into three: the transformation, the cultivation, and the secret techniques.”

“So this Divine Tortoise Transformation is the transformation technique of the Black Tortoise’s inheritance.” Lin Yun said after a brief pondering.

“Yeah, they’re the seventy-two transformation techniques, a dragon spirit cultivation technique with seventy-two stages, and seventy-two secret techniques.” Mu Chuan continued. “You understand what I mean? The transformation technique should be the weakest of the three inheritances. This is only a tortoise shell. So it can’t contain all seventy-two transformation techniques. Even if you’re not planning to keep it for your tribulation, you can save it until you encounter the Black Tortoise’s secret techniques or cultivation techniques.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts upon hearing that because he had never thought about it before. He met the Black Turtle Ancestor, and what Mu Chuan said had a high possibility, according to the Black Turtle Ancestor’s saying.

But Mu Chuan didn’t know that he had some friendship with the Black Turtle Ancestor, and he might be able to obtain another Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood if he was shameless enough.

“You must know if you can obtain any of the seventy-two secret techniques. Dragon spirit martial techniques are priceless treasures and are even stronger than the Sword Sect’s incomplete Great Profound Sword Canon.” Mu Chuan said after a brief hesitation.

“There’s no need. I have already made up my mind to use it now.” Lin Yun said.

“But this Divine Tortoise Transformation is only a portion of the seventy-two transformation techniques. As for this tortoise shell, you might not be able to obtain the full inheritance of the Divine Tortoise Transformation. The Black Tortoise’s inheritance has a legend in the Kunlun Realm. You can practice the Divine Tortoise Transformation, but you can’t neglect your sword dao because of it. Always remember that you’re a swordsman!” Mu Chuan said, looking at Lin Yun.

He initially gave Lin Yun the tortoise shell because he wanted him to learn the Black Tortoise Breathing. He didn’t expect Lin Yun to obtain the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood so quickly. After all, he had spent some effort to obtain it in the past, but he wasn’t patient enough, and his comprehension was lacking. So he ultimately chose to give up.

“I understand.” Lin Yun nodded.

Mu Chuan then explained to Lin Yun about the Divine Tortoise Transformation and told Lin Yun everything he knew. Putting it in a nutshell, even if he managed to practice the Divine Tortoise Transformation, it wouldn’t have many usages. It could be used to change one’s appearance, and one had to reach a high level to grasp this entire transformation technique.

But the moment he succeeds, even saints would have difficulty differentiating someone who disguised himself with the Divine Tortoise Transformation. If he managed to grasp all seventy-two transformation techniques, not only could he change his race, but he could also transform into a divine beast. Mu Chuan knew this, but he had no clues about secret and cultivation techniques.

An incense’s time later, the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood perfectly fused with the tortoise shell, and scriptures began to appear on the tortoise shell. There was an alarming number of scriptures, somewhere in the hundreds of thousands.

Lin Yun couldn’t see them all that clearly, relying on his naked eyes alone. When he executed the Divine Dragon Eyes, he could see some white words that had appeared on the tortoise shell hovering before him. Since he had an excellent memory, he only took two hours to read all of the scriptures.

Mu Chuan was also surprised, but remembered all of the scriptures. He quickly discovered that he had to refine a Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood before he could start practicing this transformation technique, or it would be useless, even if he remembered them.

After Lin Yun read through the scriptures, he furrowed his brows. “It’s too complicated. There are a hundred thousand scriptures, but it’s incomplete. Even if I managed to practice it, the usage isn’t as big as I imagined. Most importantly, I can only start practicing after reaching the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, after my vitality undergoes a transformation.”

“I already told you about it, but don’t belittle it. This might only be the first transformation of the Divine Tortoise Transformation, but you can freely alter your appearance and body after grasping it, including your temperament and voice. This is stronger than any other disguise technique.” Mu Chuan smiled. “Just because you don’t need it now doesn’t mean you don’t need it in the future.”

Stowing the tortoise shell, Lin Yun bitterly smiled and could only be optimistic about it. Otherwise, he had wasted a Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood for naught.

After a brief stop, Lin Yun bade his farewell. Just when he was about to open the door to his room, he stopped with his brows furrowed because someone was in his room. But who could it be? Mu Xueqin, Gu Ruochen, and Ye Qingxuan were in seclusion, while Mu Qingqing and the other saint disciples went for a stroll around the city. So who could be waiting for him in his room?

When Lin Yun pushed open the door, he saw a back figure. This person was donned in an elegant robe and was sitting where Lin Yun had previously sat. The robe this person wore was meant for men, but they were giving off a faint fragrance. Since Lin Yun was sensitive to fragrance, he instantly guessed who had come.

“An Liuyan, you’re bold!” Lin Yun said as he closed the door.

“Hehe. It has been a long time, Young Master Lin.” An Liuyan turned around. She was wielding the fan Lin Yun gave her, making her look elegant. He couldn’t imagine that this was the same bewitching An Liuyan from before. She had disguised herself well, and Lin Yun wouldn’t have recognized her if it wasn’t for the fragrance she gave off.

“I disguised myself.” An Liuyan replied.

“Your disguise is useless based on the fragrance you’re giving off.” Lin Yun smiled.

“I smeared it after coming in, fearing that you might not recognize me.” An Liuyan smiled.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned upon hearing that. But before he could figure out how An Liuyan entered his room, her voice resounded, “Young Master Lin, let’s take a stroll around the city.”
