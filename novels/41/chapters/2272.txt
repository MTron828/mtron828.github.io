Chapter 2273 - Who Is He To You?!

When the golden axe appeared in the Crow Shot Saint Lord’s hand, Lin Yun immediately felt a great threat. His sword intent was being greatly restricted, with no chance to dodge it.

This was a Sovereign Saint Artifact’s power, sealing off the enemy’s path of retreat. When the terrifying aura swept out, it knocked away everyone who was competing for the divine flame fragment as Lin Yun’s sight became filled with the golden radiance.

“Die!” The Crow Shot Saint Lord was furious with a sinister expression.

Lin Yun immediately felt immobilized with his saint aura being restricted.

Is this the power of a Sovereign Saint Artifact? Lin Yun inwardly muttered and knew why he could rely on Sovereign Saint Artifacts to kill Saints. Under the pressure of a Sovereign Saint Artifact, it could weaken his opponents by at least half. He hadn’t become a Saint Lord yet, and the pressure was so great that he couldn’t even circulate his sword intent.

But fortunately, he also had a Sovereign Saint Artifact. Just when he wanted to bring out the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear, a phoenix cry echoed throughout the world with soaring flames spreading between heaven and earth. A golden flame pillar soared to the sky, dyeing the entire sky red. The sky looked even higher than before.

Under the golden radiance, the figure that manifested from the golden axe shattered as an ancient phoenix’s aura spread out. The ground began to tremble with cracks spreading out, and this majestic aura blocked the axe. The golden axe had slowed down to the point that it was as though it had fallen into a quagmire.

When everyone turned their heads over, they saw Ji Zixi, who was enveloped in a golden flaming pillar. She had undergone nirvana and underwent a rebirth. When she opened her eyes, there was an ancient mirror with a phoenix rune hovering over her head. She waved her hand and the ancient mirror flew towards the golden axe.

“Let’s go!” When the pressure on Lin Yun disappeared, he grabbed Li Feibai and retreated to Ji Zixi’s back.

“Hehe, it looks like you didn’t save her for nothing, and I didn’t put my life at risk for nothing,” Li Feibai chuckled.

“Hush.” Lin Yun said with a grave expression while placing his hand on Li Feibai’s shoulder. As a blue dragon aura poured into Li Feibai’s body, the latter began to recover from her injuries at a rapid speed. Her wounds began to heal as her complexion became rosy once more.

Seeing that there wasn’t even a scar left, Li Feibai exclaimed, “You’re somewhat useful. At least I don’t have to worry about my injuries as long as I’m alive.”

Her injuries were serious because her Sovereign Constellation was corroded, and the Lightning Chains had even pieced her. Even if her injuries weren’t fatal, she would take at least half a month to recover. But after relying on the blue dragon aura, she had more or less recovered from her injuries in a very short time.

When Lin Yun heard Li Feibai's words, he couldn’t help smiling, “Well, you’re not bad yourself. At least you managed to keep your promise.”

“Haha, who do you think I am?” Li Feibai laughed. As they chatted, Ji Zixi descended from the sky with the Astral River Saint Lord and the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Saint Lords coming behind her.

When the Crow Shot Saint Lord landed on the ground, he grabbed the Golden Axe and coldly said, “Where are the Saint Lords of the Myriad Lightning Sect?!”

“Here!” Under his order, the Saint Lords of the Myriad Lightning Sect began to gather. The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord stepped forth and grabbed onto Huang Jingyu, feeding the latter a pellet and injecting saint energy into his body. To a Saint Lord, a severed hand wasn’t a serious injury.

But Lin Yun’s sword intent was too terrifying. If they couldn’t get rid of the sword intent, Huang Jingyu wouldn’t be able to recover from his injuries.

“It hurts…” Huang Jingyu grimaced from the pain as he shook his hand. He said, “Let’s discuss this after returning to the sect. My Sacred Moonlight Ring is in his hands, so we have to snatch it back.”

“You guys protect the young sect master.” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord instructed a few Saint Lords to protect Huang Jingyu as he rose to the sky and landed beside the Crow Shot Saint Lord. With a wave of his hand, the Sun-Moon Sacred Cauldron, the Ming Cult’s Sovereign Saint Artifact, appeared.

As a chilling aura spread out, the Heavenly Flame Sect’s Indigo Brave Saint Lord appeared with a blade. This was the Sovereign Saint Artifact of the Heavenly Flame Sect, the Heavenmourn.

When three Sovereign Saint Artifacts were brought out, the forces of the three holy lands began to gather. Three Sovereign Saint Artifacts were highly destructive and could destroy the entire Flame Dragon Valley if they were used.

If it was in the hands of a Great Saint, the power of a Sovereign Saint Artifact could be fully unleashed, possibly destroying the entire Heavenly Void. The Divine Phoenix Mountain didn’t show any weakness as they gathered behind Ji Zixi, circulating the Phoenix Sacred Canon with flames gathering behind them, before pouring them into the Divine Phoenix Mirror.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Even when facing three Sovereign Saint Artifacts, they were confident in the Divine Phoenix Mirror.

Outside the Flame Dragon Valley, Zhao Tianyu and the Ying River King stood together, wearing smiles. The Ying River King said, “You know them the best. You've already guessed that they would fight amongst themselves.

“As expected, four Sovereign Saint Artifacts.” The Ying River King was also fearful of the Sovereign Saint Artifact.

“The show has just begun. But that’s also the end because the Sovereign Saint Artifacts are too powerful, so they won’t fight for real,” Zhao Tianyu analysed. Compared to Sovereign Saint Artifacts, the existence of a Saint Lord was insignificant. The four holy lands would suffer with at least half of their forces being casualties if they fought.

“It’s our turn now.” The Ying River King looked at Zhao Tianyu, and asked, “We’re all prepared now. So where’s your divine maiden?”

“She has long appeared, it's just that you’re unaware of it,” Zhao Tianyu smiled.

“I’m unaware of it?” The Ying River King’s face changed as he looked around, but he couldn’t find Wang Muyan anywhere.

“There’s no need to look for her,” Zhao Tianyu said. “The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda is a time-space treasure that's far more powerful than the Sovereign Saint Artifacts. She will give you a surprise and not a single one of them can leave. They will become your toys.”

The Ying River King’s eyes flashed with greed as he looked at Ji Zixi. He said, “I want that Phoenix Holy Maiden. She has huge potential.”

“Oh.” Zhao Tianyu merely smiled.

“Flower Burial, along with Li Feibai as well!” The Ying River King clenched his fist.

“That will depend on your own capability,” Zhao Tianyu replied.

The Ying River King looked at Lin Yun deeply, before he said, “The Demonspirit’s foundation in the Heavenly Void far exceeds your imagination.”

“Let’s see, then,” Zhao Tianyu smiled.

Within the Flame Dragon Valley, while no one had any idea that danger had arrived, the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord said, “Astral River Saint Lord, your Divine Phoenix Mountain still wants to monopolize the divine flame fragment when it has come this far?”

The Astral River Saint Lord smiled, “We’ve already discussed that we’d depend on our abilities if there’s only one divine flame fragment. You want to go against our agreement now?”

“Am I wrong? Are we not relying on our abilities? Can your Divine Phoenix Mountain face the three holy lands by yourself?” The Indigo Brave Saint Lord spoke out.

Ji Zixi said, “We’re all cultivators of the Eastern Desolation. We’ll benefit the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan if we fight amongst ourselves.”

“That’s right. If we fight amongst ourselves, you guys might not be able to bear the consequences,” the Astral River Saint Lord said.

The faces of the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord, Crow Shot Saint Lord, and Indigo Brave Saint Lord changed. This was why they weren’t willing to use the Sovereign Saint Artifacts. Even if they could suppress the Divine Phoenix Mirror, they would have to suffer heavy casualties, losing at least half of their forces.

“How about this?” The Crow Shot Saint Lord said, “We all have Great Saints outside the Divine Phoenix Mountain. You guys can preserve the divine flame fragment, but we’ll decide again who it belongs to when we’re out.”

“Sure,” the Astral River Saint Lord smiled.

“But… you guys have to hand over Flower Burial. The Heavenly Dao Sect isn’t around, so there’s no need to protect him,” the Crow Shot Saint Lord looked at Lin Yun with murderous intent flashing in his eyes.

Lin Yun was treating Li Feibai’s injuries, but he merely smiled upon seeing the Crow Shot Saint Lord’s murderous intent.

“Dream on.” Ji Zixi said coldly. “Lin Yun is a guest of the Divine Phoenix Mountain and my saviour. Not to mention in the God Burial Mountain Range, don’t even think about touching him outside.”

“You!” The Crow Shot Saint Lord was furious because Ji Zixi’s strong stance was beyond his expectations. Even the Saint Lords of the Divine Phoenix Mountain couldn’t help looking at Ji Zixi with surprise.

“At least hand over the Sacred Moonlight Ring of my Ming Cult,” the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord said.

Before Lin Yun could reply, Ji Zixi spoke out, “It already belongs to him, and you want him to return it? Is your Ming Cult willing to spit out the Blood Flame King’s treasures, then?”

The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord’s face changed and became as ugly as the Crow Shot Saint Lord’s. He gritted his teeth, and he said, “Why are you protecting him, and who is he to you?!”
