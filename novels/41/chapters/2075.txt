Chapter 2076 - Eight Ominous Beasts (1)

Lin Yun’s words were like a flash of lightning that shocked everyone with disbelief. They didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to be so cocky even after Feng Shaoyu revealed his cultivation at the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm.

Feng Shaoyu’s face changed, and he said, “You’ll pay the price for your cockiness!”

“If this was a life-and-death battle, you would already be dead by now,” Lin Yun said.

“As expected of you to be so rocky,” Feng Shaoyu said in disdain. He clearly didn’t believe what Ye Qingtian said. Even if Ye Qingtian brought out his two sword stars, Feng Shaoyu didn’t feel that Ye Qingtian could defeat him. After all, the power of a Quasi-Saint in the Indigo Origin Phase wasn’t something Ye Qingtian could imagine.

But Lin Yun wasn’t being cocky because he was speaking the truth. He had plenty of ways to defeat Feng Shaoyu. The simplest way would be using the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. However, while it might be a weapon, it depended on who used it. Even if others possessed a Sovereign Saint Artifact, they also might not be able to bring out the true power of it.

His other trump card would be Light of the Beginning. He had already reached a formidable level with it, forming a whole set of sword techniques. 

Since Feng Shaoyu comprehended lesser dao when he had just stepped into the Indigo Origin Phase, he might not be able to see or block Lin Yun’s sword, and he would take Feng Shaoyu’s life if he wasn’t careful with it. This was troublesome for Lin Yun because he had to use his sword techniques to exhaust Feng Shaoyu’s saint aura.

“You don’t believe what I said? Let’s try it, then,” Lin Yun swung the Flower Burial Sword in his hand and the thirty-six galaxies turned into sword rain that descended towards Feng Shaoyu.

Feng Shaoyu’s face sank as he swallowed a purple pellet, and his saint aura soon filled his body. He grabbed the Dragon Bone Sword and shattered the incoming attacks before charging towards Ye Qingtian.

The longer he dragged on the fight, the more variables there would be. Feng Shaoyu decided to end the battle quickly, not allowing Ye Qingtian to do anything else.

“Blood Purgatory Pluto Claw!” Feng Shaoyu swung his sword down after arriving before Lin Yun, with his saint aura manifesting into a descending crimson claw along with the Dragon Bone Sword, tearing space apart.

Lin Yun raised his sword to block the incoming sword as the galaxies trembled. The saint aura failed to shatter the Astral Sword Intent. As the two sword stars rotated, the galaxies intertwined, and the aura Lin Yun gave off increased and shattered the incoming claw instead.

Right then, spikes appeared on the Dragon Bone Sword that was in Feng Shaoyu’s hand and wrapped around the Flower Burial Sword. When it coiled around the Flower Burial Sword and was about to bite Lin Yun’s hand, Lin Yun was forced to let go of it.

“You fell for it!” Feng Shaoyu laughed. “I’ve noticed that you’re undefeated, relying on your attainment in the sword, but how are you doing to defend yourself from my indigo saint aura without your sword? Die!”

When Feng Shaoyu said that, he spread his arms apart, executed a ghost spirit movement technique, and dashed over. His two hands manifested into a crimson claw that was about to reach Lin Yun’s chest.

“You want to fight barehanded with me? I’m afraid you’ll lose even more quickly!” Lin Yun snorted as the two sword stars entered his body, forming two layers of radiance on his body. At the same time, Lin Yun turned around to dodge the incoming attack before arriving at Feng Shaoyu’s side, pushing a palm at the latter’s shoulder.

Lin Yun’s attack made the saint aura around Feng Shaoyu tremble before the latter took several steps back. That earlier attack nearly shattered the saint aura around Feng Shaoyu.

This made Feng Shaoyu even more furious because Ye Qingtian was faster than him. He now realized that Ye Qiungtian had practiced a formidable movement technique that could perform short-distance teleportation.

This meant Ye Qingtian had no weaknesses, and he would gain the initiative in a bare-handed fight. He could only pray that Ye Qingtian wasn’t proficient in a barehanded fight. He refused to believe that Ye Qingtian was an all-rounded fighter. After all, Feng Shaoyu spent a year tempering his physique.

Whenever Lin Yun executed the Divine Sunchasing Art, he would leave behind ripples in the surrounding space and create afterimages before quickly appearing behind Feng Shaoyu and throwing a punch out. But when his punch clashed against Feng Shaoyu’s saint aura, his attack rebounded.

The power of Feng Shaoyu’s indigo saint aura was several times stronger than the azure saint aura. Not only did Lin Yun fail to tear apart the indigo saint aura, but the rebound force made his fist ache.

“Haha, I bet you must be feeling terrible now, right? Even if I stand here and do nothing, there’s no way you can break through my defenses!” Feng Shaoyu laughed.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Lin Yun bore the pain without flinching or hesitation as he dashed over again. In a single breath, Lin Yun threw out eighty-odd punches and used his full strength in each attack. His punches were like swords, accompanied by a dragon roar that created a series of explosions against the indigo saint aura.

Feng Shaoyu didn’t dodge but only circulated his saint dao to empower his saint aura. As he blocked Lin Yun’s attacks, he laughed, “Someone at the Nirvana Stage wants to fight me?”

But Feng Shaoyu’s face soon changed as he watched Ye Qingtian form seals.

The Blue Dragon Seal, Indigo Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal… the Sovereign Dragon Seal. When eight divine radiance shone brightly, the Sovereign Dragon Seal flew out. After Lin Yun executed the complete Sovereign Dragon Seal, he finally broke through Feng Shaoyu’s defenses.

“No… How is this possible?!” Feng Shaoyu felt a sharp pain in his chest as his ribs broke, and the attack's impact reached his internal organs.

Fine cracks also appeared on the two layers of radiance, and Lin Yun was injured in the process. That earlier attack should’ve shattered Feng Shaoyu’s ribs into fragments, injuring his meridians and internal organs. “Saint aura really is extraordinary. I only managed to break his ribs…”

Lin Yun wasn’t too aggressive and merely sent a kick out. His kick was like a tail sweep of a blue dragon, and the huge impact made Feng Shaoyu’s internal organs tremble before he threw out a mouthful of blood.
