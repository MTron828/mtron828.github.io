Chapter 1760 – Beautiful and Independent

Lin Yun recited what Mei Zihua told him as he walked toward the Three-Lives Tree, and he stopped when he was a few hundred meters away from the tree.

Not far away, Qin Hao, Chen Jun, Zhang Ying, and the others were calm. They no longer held any hope for the tree to bloom.

But when they saw Lin Yun approaching, their faces changed, and they didn’t dare to look Lin Yun in the eyes.

“Brother Lin, it’s all yours.” The Heavenly Dao Sect’s Liu Ruochen smiled. Beside him, Ye Chen asked, “The Three-Lives Tree is weird. It can listen to our music and can even appreciate it. But it just won’t bloom no matter what. Brother Lin, are you confident?”

His words drew everyone’s attention. Jiang Yingtian also looked at Lin Yun with anticipation. If Lin Yun could make a flower bloom on the Three-Lives Tree, there was no doubt that it would significantly increase the popularity of the next Nirvana Banquet.

After all, the Nirvana Banquet had been going downhill in recent years. This was because no one could make the Three-Lives Tree bloom. As a result, only a few people were willing to come; take the Ten Musical Clans, for example. They had no shortage of ancient scores and Sovereign Saint Artifacts that could assist them in mental cultivation.

So only the Three-Lives Fruit was attractive to them. But the Three-Lives Fruit could only be obtained by the first on the Nirvana Banquet, which meant that no one else could obtain it. Thus, they only had to send a disciple from one of the Ten Musical Clans, and the other clans would lose interest.

Take this Nirvana Banquet, for example. After learning that Mei Zihua was coming, the descendants of the other Ten Musical Clans instantly lost interest. The Ten Musical Clans often interacted with each other, and Mei Zihua was a genius in musical dao. So they knew each other’s strengths well. This meant that since Mei Zihua came, there would be no hope for others.

“Let me give it a try.” Lin Yun said calmly.

Jiang Yingtian couldn’t help feeling a little disappointed when he noticed Lin Yun’s confidence wasn’t too high. But he still replied with a smile, “It’s okay. Don’t pressure yourself.”

When Lin Yun turned around to look at the Three-Lives Tree, he took a deep breath. Amongst the three musical instruments he possessed, Lin Yun chose the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute without hesitation. This flute had a special meaning to him, and this musical instrument also accompanied him for the longest time.

Raising the flute to his lips, Lin Yun began to play it. He was playing the Phoenix Heart Song of the Divine Phoenix Clan this time. This music made others feel at ease, and it also assisted in the cultivation of mental energy. Lin Yun would practice this almost every day, so this became something he was the most familiar with.

If the Three-Lives Tree had intelligence, this song would definitely benefit it the most. When he played the Phoenix Heart Song, everyone was immersed in it, and their hearts became peaceful.

“That’s the Phoenix Heart Song!” Ye Chen became emotional, and he felt like the fire within his body was slowly burning under the song. Since he practiced the cultivation technique of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, his cultivation technique began to circulate within his body under the stimulation of the Phoenix Heart Song. It wasn’t just him; the other Divine Phoenix Mountain’s seniors also became emotional.

Under the flute music, everyone felt peaceful, like a cooling summer night with the moon hanging high in the sky.

Lin Yun shut his eyes, and stood beneath the Three-Lives Tree. When moonlight shone on the sapphire lake, the moonlight scattered across every branch and leaf of the Three-Lives Tree. The moonlight was like snowflakes falling on Lin Yun, and this scene made everyone stare in awe.

This scenery was too beautiful. It wasn’t just Lin Yun. The scenery looked like a dream, and it felt realistic at the same time. There was a sapphire lake, a gently swaying Three-Lives Tree, moonlight that felt like snowflakes, and Lin Yun standing under the beautiful scenery. Everyone couldn’t find a word to describe the current Lin Yun. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Suddenly, the lake’s surface began to tremble, and moonlight gushed out from the bottom of the lake. The sky suddenly turned dark, and it looked like two moons were about to jump out from the lake.

“It’s going to bloom!” Everyone was stunned, and they became emotional.

Qin Hao and the others suddenly became anxious. This was because they didn’t want the Three-Lives Tree, which hadn’t bloomed for centuries, to bloom by the hands of this barbarian. This was something that they couldn’t accept. The four didn’t even bother concealing their facial expressions, and they nearly spoke out on the spot.

As the two moons bloomed, the moonlight made Lin Yun look like a celestial.

“Something isn’t right…” Jiang Yingtian’s smile froze on his face. Lin Yun was nearly done with the song, but the Three-Lives Tree still showed no signs of blooming.

The smile on the faces of Yue Weiwei and others also disappeared. Everyone by the lakeside furrowed their brows, and the commotion gradually died. This was because everyone finally sensed that something wasn’t right.

This relieved Qin Hao’s group of four, and Hua Hongyu laughed on the spot. The phenomenon disappeared when Lin Yun finished the song, and the sky became clear again.

Many people looked disappointed. Lin Yun’s song was perfect, the artistic concept was beautiful, and it was never seen before. Judging from the signs the Three-Lives Tree showed earlier, everyone was expecting the tree to bloom. But Lin Yun still fell short in the end.

Holding onto the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, Lin Yun looked at the Three-Lives Tree and fell into deep thoughts. He pondered what Mei Zihua said. A flower only blooms for a tree. Did it really mean it that way?

When he saw Jiang Yingtian approaching, he turned around and asked, “Young Pavilion Master, can I give it another try?”

Jiang Yingtian was taken aback when he heard Lin Yun’s request.

“Ha. Lin Xiao, who do you think you are? Do you think you can receive special treatment just because you’re first on the Nirvana Banquet? We only have one chance, but you want two?” Hua Hongyu said before Jiang Yingtian could say a word.

With a gentle smile, Qin Hao said, “How can we possibly break the rules? If Young Master Lin wants another go, doesn’t that mean we can go at it again?”

His tone was calm, but his words were vicious. If Jiang Yingtian agreed to it, he would be placed in a difficult position.

Jiang Yingtian naturally furrowed his brows while looking at them unhappily because they talked a lot.

“Hahaha. Where did you come from? For a nobody, you people really talk a lot. You people think you guys are qualified to talk here?” Mei Zihua walked over with a laugh.

“Mei Zihua, even if the Ten Musical Clans are strong, are you looking down on my Heavenly Flame Sect?” Qin Hao said coldly.

“Don’t bother gold plating yourself.” Mei Zihua said in disdain. “You’re a nobody in the Heavenly Flame Sect. Who in their right mind would spend time on music dao in a holy land? Are you a saint’s disciple? Shut your mouth if you’re not. Based on someone of your status, you’re not even qualified to enter my house.”

Qin Hao’s face became red, and he was furious when he heard what Mei Zihua said.

“What’s wrong? You still have the face to become angry?” Mei Zihua looked haughty, and he snickered, “Get lost. Your very existence dirties my eyes. If not for Lin Xiao, you wouldn’t even have an opportunity to play for the Three-Lives Tree.”

When he was done speaking, he waved his hand and sent a powerful force towards Qin Hao, causing the latter to throw out a mouthful of blood on the spot. When Qin Hao was knocked away on the lake, this instantly made Hua Hongyu’s face pale with fright, and she froze.

“You get lost as well. I don’t hit women.” Mei Zihua said bluntly.

His actions were swift, shocking everyone. When they came to their senses, they finally recalled how arrogant Mei Zihua was, and he didn’t even put Jiang Yingtian in his eyes. So why would he care about Qin Hao? It was just that everyone had forgotten how arrogant Mei Zihua was when he was so polite to Lin Yun.

Qin Hao had grievances written on his face, but he didn’t even dare to raise his head to look at Mei Zihua. He quickly fled with Hua Hongyu. What happened today was a great humiliation to Qin Hao and Hua Hongyu, and Mei Zihua was a little too unreasonable.

“Young Pavilion Master, let Lin Xiao have another try. I’ll be willing to give him my spot.” Mei Zihua smiled at Jiang Yingtian.

“Are you sure about that?” Jiang Yingtian asked suspiciously.

“That’s for sure.” Mei Zihua smiled.

As a smile rose on his face, Jiang Yingtian turned to look at Lin Yun, “That’s fine. You’re the one who got the spot for him, and it’s returned to you now. This isn’t a violation of the rules. So, Lin Xiao, you can give it another attempt.”

“Thank you, Young Pavilion Master.” Lin Yun replied.

“Not going to thank Young Master Mei?” Mei Zihua asked with a smile.

But when Lin Yun looked at him, Mei Zihua laughed before walking away. This gave Lin Yun a good impression of Mei Zihua. Since he could have another attempt, he naturally wouldn’t give up on this opportunity. Taking a deep breath, he raised the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute to his lips.

When he raised his head, he looked at Yue Weiwei. This made Yue Weiwei’s heart tremble because Lin Yun’s gaze made her feel like a starry sky had enveloped her. Before she could think more about it, the flute melody resounded.

As the melody was being played, everyone was instantly amazed. This was another ancient score that no one had heard before, and the melody was so beautiful that it was beyond any description. But everyone soon felt something wasn’t right because this was a love song. The neverending affection, endless reminiscing, the beauty of the lover, and the sweetness in the melody were breathtaking. This was the ancient score of the Divine Phoenix Clan, Courting Phoenix.

Very quickly, everyone turned to look at Yue Weiwei because it was clear this song was meant for her. Under the Three-Lives Tree, Lin Yun played the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and slowly walked towards Yue Weiwei.

Everyone else on the Dual Moon Lake already came to their senses, but their lips twitched and consciously moved away from them. Before Mu Xueling left, her pupils were filled with amazement, and she looked at Lin Yun with a complicated expression.

Lin Yun expressed his feelings through his flute, like a phoenix soaring high in the sky, seeking the phoenix in his heart. He had gone through many hardships, and there were many things that he couldn’t share with others. Today, Lin Yun spoke through his melody as he gently walked toward Yue Weiwei.

Yue Weiwei’s face blushed. She might always have a smile on her face, but she also had a lot of grievances in her heart. It’s just that she never showed them to Lin Yun. She felt heartache for him but didn’t dare to reveal too much. She feared she would be hurt if she got too close to him. But she really couldn’t help herself. Lin Yun was the one she loved.

Her heart had long gone to Lin Yun in the Yin Wind Stream. In addition to their experiences on the Heavenly Path, she gave Lin Yun the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute. She knew a lot. She might not express them, but that didn’t mean she didn’t care. But at this moment, she really didn’t care about them anymore.

Nothing was more beautiful in the world than the person you cared about also cared about you. Yue Weiwei could hear the affection and pain concealed within Lin Yun’s melody. Yue Weiwei’s heart slowly opened without her realizing it, and all the moonlight on the Dual Moon Lake was gathered on her.

When Lin Yun was done, he reached out with his right hand. Yue Weiwei smiled, and she gently reached out with her hand before they held hands. When they held hands, a gentle ripple spread out on the lake, and multiple three-colored flowers bloomed on the sapphire lake. They were like the most beautiful lamps in the world shining on the two lovers.

The Three-Lives Flowers had bloomed, and everyone was amazed that the flowers weren’t growing on the Three-Lives Tree. Mei Zihua smiled by the lakeside. The legend was really true. A flower only blooms for a tree…
