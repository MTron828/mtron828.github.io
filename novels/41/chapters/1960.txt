Chapter 1961 - So What If I Can't Return?

While the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was lecturing in the Solar Jade Palace, the Dragon Origin Great Saint was chatting with Ye Guhan at his residence. It had been a long time since they met, and Ye Guhan discovered that the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s complexion had become haggard.

This was a rare scene because the Dragon Origin Great Saint became a Saint by relying on his physique, which meant his vitality far exceeded his peers. Even if he fought for half a year, he could drag his opponent down through the exhaustion alone, which had happened before.

Ye Guhan knew that the Dragon Origin Great Saint and his master, the Radiant Sword Saint faced the attack of a powerhouse from the demonic sect for half a month, fighting and running for half a month, buying half a month for his master. Half a month later, the Radiant Sword Saint used a sword to slay that powerhouse, thus becoming famous within the Eastern Desolation.

“Martial Uncle, your complexion doesn’t look well. Are you preparing to make a breakthrough to the Emperor Realm?” Ye Guhan said, chewing on the Divine Dragon Fruit.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint rolled his eyes and said, “I’m not Radiant. He can clearly make a breakthrough, but he insists on forcing himself into such a desperate strait that has nothing to do with the Emperor Realm. I’ll be fortunate if I can reach the Quasi-Emperor Realm within a hundred years, but it’s not that easy.”

“Then, what is it?” Ye Guhan asked.

Wanting to speak about this, the Dragon Origin Great Saint became excited. He raised his brow and said, “That disciple of mine wants to fuse the two saint physiques into a divine physique. So I naturally have to find a way for him.”

Ye Guhan fell into deep thoughts and asked, “Martial Uncle, have you found a way, then?”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint sighed, “Divine physiques have been rare since ancient times, and most bearers of divine physiques are born with it. It’s too hard to form an acquired divine physique.”

“Forming an acquired divine physique is heaven-defying, to begin with. So trying to acquire one is no different from going against heaven.” Ye Guhan nodded in agreement.

“I’ve finally found a way,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said.

“What?!” Ye Guhan’s face was covered with shock, and he muttered, “H-How?”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint sipped the tea with a smirk rising on his lips. His haggard complexion had a wisp of superiority, and he smiled, “Radiant can’t do it, right?”

“My master really can’t do it,” Ye Guhan awkwardly smiled with the corner of his lips twitching.

“Ha!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint lowered his cup with a smug look on his face, fully displaying his superiority against the Radiant Sword Saint’s lineage.

This made Ye Guhan feel helpless, but he could do nothing about it, even after being looked down upon. He now knew why the Radiant Sword Saint wanted to send Lin Yun to the Heavenly Dao Sect, and his master must’ve predicted this scene.

“What’s the method?” Ye Guhan asked. He knew Lin Yun grasped two saint physiques, and it wouldn’t be easy for him to combine them.

“I flipped through the ancient records. Not even those of the Azure Dragon’s lineage would practice the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. Most would choose another divine physique that wasn’t inferior in comparison, but is easier to cultivate. That’s the Azure Dragon Overlord Physique…” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said. He became a saint by relying on his physique and naturally knew more than the Azure Dragon’s lineage.

“The Azure Dragon Overlord Physique is strong, and it’s not at all inferior to divine physiques. It might even be stronger in some factors, but it’s not a genuine divine physique…” The Dragon Origin Great Saint briefly paused, then continued, “I just realized that the inheritance of the Azure Dragon Divine Physique is almost lost, and the books that brat gave me aren’t complete. Since ancient times, no one has been able to form the Azure Dragon DIvine Physique. But before that, the Azure Dragon Divine Physique is one of the ten strongest divine physiques.”

Ye Guhan was stunned because he never expected the Azure Dragon Divine Physique to have such a huge origin.

“As for why the inheritance is lost, that is because every time the Azure Dragon Divine Physique has been improved, the Sovereign Constellation would descend and initiate the Azure Dragon Tribulation. In general, the bearers would die before reaching the pinnacle,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said. “Compared to that, the Azure Dragon Overlord Physique might be dangerous, but there are still people who’ve reached the pinnacle.”

“So?” Ye Guhan’s expression became solemn.

“So I have to find something for him. It can help him complete the Azure Dragon Divine Physique and bring him a glimmer of hope,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said.

“What is it?”

“Only deities can defy the heavens, and only deities can resist the Azure Dragon Tribulation,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint replied.

Hearing what the Dragon Origin Great Saint said, Ye Guhan instantly knew what the former wanted to look for. He immediately rose to his feet with his face changed. His tone trembled as he said, “Dragon Origin Great Saint, you…”

“He’s my disciple, so what’s wrong with me trying to find a glimmer of hope for him? You don’t have to persuade me because I have made up my mind,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint smiled.

Ye Guhan became silent because he knew persuading the Dragon Origin Great Saint was futile. He sighed, “Which god's battleground are you heading towards?”

“The Divine Dragon Grave beyond the Eastern Seas,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint answered.

Hearing that, Ye Guhan knew that the Dragon Origin Great Saint was serious about this. He asked, “When are you leaving?”

“I have already prepared to go, I was just waiting for you. Since you’re here, I’ll be taking my leave now.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint hesitated and asked, “How’s that old man doing?”

“He can’t give up that sword in his heart,” Ye Guhan said.

“I knew it.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint slapped his thigh and said, “That old man has never considered himself beneath anyone. Since he wants to make a breakthrough to the Emperor Realm, he naturally wants to go after Yu Qingfeng.”

Who was Yu Qingfeng? He was a peerless swordsman, the Sword Emperor. He might become a Sword God if he was born in the ancient Golden Era.

“You’ve gone to the Jian Clan, right? How was it?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint asked.

“It's not time for it to be revealed,” Ye Guhan said.

“Ha.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint mocked, “They’re just a bunch of tortoises, thinking of not taking any risk. Yet, they call themselves the Emperor Clan. Are they even worthy?”

Ye Guhan also furrowed his brow. He didn’t acknowledge what the Dragon Origin Great Saint said but didn’t want to refute those words. He changed the topic, “Does the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint know about Lin Yun’s identity?”

“Most likely not,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint smiled. “But I’m guessing that she managed to notice something. She looked for you, right?”

“I pretended not to be home. I don’t dare to lie before her,” Ye Guhan smiled.

“Hahaha!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint laughed, “That brat is right to come to the Heavenly Dao Sect. He’s fortunate because the Serene Dust Great Saint also has her eyes on him. Hahaha!”

“Tian Xuanzi has almost recovered from his injuries,” Ye Guhan said.

“I remembered that sissy said he wants to rule the Eastern Desolation. Hahaha! He’s only a hound of the Empress. Is he even qualified?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint’s eyes were filled with disdain, finishing his tea before leaving. He was decisive, and he wouldn’t waste any time since he made up his mind.

“Dragon Origin Great Saint, this trip…” Ye Guhan looked at the Dragon Origin Great Saint and sobbed. He couldn’t finish his sentence because this trip would be dangerous for the Dragon Origin Great Saint, with his life on the line.

“You want to say that I might not be able to return?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint laughed, “Ye Guhan, I don’t like your words. Am I any weaker than that old man? Furthermore, he’s my disciple. So what if I can’t return?!”

Lin Yun took out the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s medal within the Solar Jade Palace, having no idea that his master was heading towards a god's battleground.

Everyone in the palace was shocked by him, and they became nervous. After all, Ye Qingtian was too cocky. Not only did he slap a Saint Lord, but he even dared to contradict the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. One must know that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was one of the Three Sword Saints within the Eastern Desolation.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In the entire Kunlun Realm, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was at the top of the pyramid, and they would be implicated if she became furious.

When Lin Yun finished, he stood up and wanted to leave.

“Sit.” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, and Lin Yun was pressed down to his seat by a sword intent. This sword intent was gentle like water, but it contained a majestic power.

“Master, perhaps he’s not lying.” Bai Shuying might not like Ye Qingtian, but she still helped him to speak up.

“Ye Qingtian, even the Dragon Origin Great Saint also doesn’t dare to speak such words in front of me,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said without any fluctuation in her emotions.

“If you can say something, I won’t punish you for no reason. After all, you can’t interrupt me for no reason. If everyone interrupted me, how would I continue my lecture?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, and her words easily crushed Lin Yun’s aura.

Lin Yun inwardly sighed on the mat because he knew he lost, regardless of the reasons or the sword. He had lost completely. His sword intent was dissolved, and the star in his sword sea also became dim.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and circulated the Myriad Astral Celestial Art, maintaining his composure and ensuring his star wouldn’t be extinguished. When the star reignited, Lin Yun cupped his hands together, “Martial Aunt is right, and I’m willing to accept your punishment.”

There was a hidden meaning in his words. He acknowledged that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was right, but he did nothing wrong, either. He would naturally accept it if she punishes him, but he wouldn’t accept it willingly.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint smiled, “I never said I wanted to punish you. Why don’t you tell me what’s wonderful about the music? Everyone’s listening to my lecture while you’re the only one paying attention to the music. If you can’t explain it, I’ll consider you disrespectful, and it won’t be as simple as getting lost.”

Lin Yun smiled because that was easy for him. He said, “The music is wonderful, but the person playing it is even more wonderful. The Nether Orchid Holy Maiden is a beauty like jade, and the music is like the shattering sounds of jade. Jade generally represents nobility, and her music is pure, like jade. But what made it wonderful was the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden, a peerless beauty.”

Lin Yun’s explanation stumped everyone, but the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint interrupted him, “So you’re saying that I’m inferior to the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden and I’m not a beauty? Why did you ignore my lecture and only listen to the music?”

Everyone’s faces changed, including Bai Shuying. Yuan Chen, who sat beside Ye Qingtian, also couldn’t help becoming nervous.

Xiao Jingyan and others wore gloating smiles because they all knew this was a dangerous question. No matter how he answered, he would have to offend the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden or the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.
