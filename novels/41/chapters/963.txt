Chapter 964 - Constellation Dragonlocking Array

As Liu Mu, Mo Yan, and Xu Que unleashed their attacks, the surrounding atmosphere froze. The attacks locked onto Lin Yun without allowing him to escape.

Although he was restricted, Lin Yun didn’t avoid the attacks. Taking one step forward, Lin Yun circulated his sword sutras and unleashed the sword aura that he had been restraining.

Along with a brilliant sword hum and dragon roar, a massive amount of origin energy gushed out from Lin Yun’s body. At this moment, his aura matched everyone else’s aura.

“Pinnacle second soul Heavenly Soul Realm!” Lin Yun’s sudden outburst left many spectators shocked. Even Liu Mu, Mo Yan, and Xu Que were surprised. After all, it made no sense for Lin Yun to reach the pinnacle second soul Heavenly Soul Realm when he had just gone through his tribulation. What was even more terrifying was that Lin Yun’s aura wasn’t any weaker than theirs.

In the past, they were afraid of Lin Yun’s sword intent and advanced fortune martial technique. But now, Lin Yun’s origin energy was the same as theirs. Their shock was natural.

“Don’t panic. He’s only in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. There’s nothing he can do with the three of us working together!” Liu Mu yelled to get Xu Que and Mo Yan’s attention back. He knew that they had to deal with Lin Yun today or else there would be endless troubles in the future.

“Even though you joined forces, you’re still trash.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. He ran out of patience long ago and their teaming up crossed his bottom line.

When he was in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm, he didn’t think much of them. Naturally, he didn’t think much of them now that he was stronger. He didn’t care that they were from the higher realms. That wasn’t a good enough reason to look down on others.

Raising his right hand, Lin Yun started circulating the Azure Dragon Enneaform. Immediately after, the black azure dragon breath bloomed on his palm. At the same time, Lin yujn’s origin energy circulated violently while three seals appeared. Shortly after, an earth-shattering roar echoed out as ancient black flames appeared. Lin Yun was unleashing a terrifying aura from his palm.

“Azure Dragon Incinerating Palm!” After reaching the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm, he had undergone a drastic transformation. So even if he didn’t use an advanced fortune martial technique, he was confident that he could suppress them with his Flamecloud Incinerating Palm and azure dragon breath.

When a dragon claw enveloped in black flames reached out from the flames behind Lin Yun, it flew towards Liu Mu, Mo Yan, and Xu Que. Quickly, it exploded and sent flames everywhere as a terrifying flaming tornado struck.

Just like that, the dragon claw flew towards Liu Mu, Mo Yan, and Xu Que under everyone’s shocked gazes. In that split second, the might of the dragon claw was thoroughly unleashed. But there was nothing they could do as their attacks swiftly crumbled.

The ancient dragon claw crushed through everything in its path. It was clearly a greater fortune martial technique. But in Lin Yun’s hands, it was even more terrifying than the advanced fortune martial technique he executed back at the shrine. This alone was too unbelievable as Liu Mu, Mo Yan, and Xu Que felt their backs drip with sweat. They couldn’t figure out how Lin Yun managed to accomplish this.

Could it be that he was hiding his strength two days ago? But before they could think more about it, the dragon claw slammed into them. They couldn’t even put up any defence and were sent flying out as their faces became pale.

It was a scene that took the spectators by surprise. Not only did Lin Yun face three people all by himself, but he managed to do so with a single strike. Clearly, he was a lot stronger. With his current strength, he probably wasn’t any worse than the other astral owners.

But Lin Yun was clearly only in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm, which confused the crowd. Then, an ear-piercing voice sounded out like a sharp sword that tore through the horizon. Lin Yun charged forward and circulated both sword sutras at the same time, unleashing his boundless killing intent.

This time, everyone knew that Lin Yun was determined to kill Liu Mu, Mo Yan, and Xu Que. Just thinking about it sent shivers down their spines. They couldn’t imagine what kind of uproar it would cause if the three of them actually died. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Furthermore, all three of them were famous. So when Liu Mu landed on a large rock and threw up blood, he impatiently yelled, “Mu Ziyi, how long is it going to take?!”

But the moment he finished yelling, a terrifying aura enveloped the entire region and dyed the sky red. Lin Yun also came to a stop because he was surprised by the fluctuation of spiritual runes in the surroundings.

“Hahaha. Lin Yun, you’re dead!” Mu Ziyi laughed as he appeared out of nowhere with a seal in his hand. Then, ten crimson stars appeared with countless black shackles intertwining and restricting Lin Yun in mid-air. It was just like when Mu Ziyi restrained the Gold-furred Demonic Ape.

But this time, the array was a lot stronger because it was refined with ten beast cores containing dragon bloodline. Liu Mu, Mo Yan, and Xu Que wiped the blood off their lips and sneered while looking at Lin Yun. Xu Que wore a sinister smile and laughed, “Lin Yun, the fun has just begun!”
