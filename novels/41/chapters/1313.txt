Chapter 1314 - Is It Funny?

The Profound Wither Island was massive, and over one month had passed since everyone entered. So most of the border regions were already swept up by everyone.

Some people who were satisfied with their harvest stayed at the border of the Profound Wither Island waiting to leave after two months. There were too many deaths on the Profound Wither Island, and those who survived the massacre had all experienced all sorts of brutalities here.

But there were still many people heading to the core region, searching for opportunities. They wanted to get as much as they could before the seal on the entire island disappeared. There were many opportunities on the Profound Wither Island, and the true opportunity wasn’t that easy to find.

But the bigger reason was that they weren’t satisfied with their harvest. Then again, none of them who could come this far were weaklings, and they had obtained huge harvests. But this also meant that their greed would grow even bigger and couldn’t be fulfilled.

They could clearly sense that the celestial aura on the island had been weakened, and this made everyone who was in the core region even more anxious. This also meant that the killings became even more intense, and they didn’t have much time left.

Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple also spent some time getting there. The core region of the island had too many opportunities, and the appearance of each one of them would spark a series of brutal competitions. But those opportunities were nothing to Lin Yun unless it was the birth of a saint elixir. After all, saint elixirs were extremely precious, and there were many rare herbs in the Profound Wither Island.

After coming to the core region, he was mainly focused on searching for saint elixirs. But saint elixirs were too rare, and he didn’t get anything even after a huge amount of effort.

“Don’t tell me that I’m this unlucky…” Lin Yun smiled in a helpless tone as he rubbed his nose. He had grown incredibly strong, and he wouldn’t be afraid even if he had to face powerful sects. Thus, he wanted a fight to gauge his current strength.

“Quasi-saint elixir?” Lin Yun’s firmament sword intent was keen, and he could sense the birth of a quasi-saint elixir ten-odd miles away. Since saint elixirs were too hard to find, it wouldn’t be bad to obtain some quasi-saint elixirs before the greater saint origin appeared. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun executed his movement technique and appeared on a stone pillar a hundred miles away.

“What speed!” There were those who saw Lin Yun’s speed, and they were so shocked that they couldn’t close their mouths. After all, Lin Yun had practically disappeared within a golden flash.

Beneath the stone pillar, Lin Yun could see a vast view a myriad meter in radius. On the ground, there were people fighting amongst themselves, and there were many people ganging up on two people. They weren’t weak; they were all at the pinnacle of Lesser Elysium Core Realm, and their auras were a lot stronger than other cultivators in this region. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

With a glance, Lin Yun could tell that they were disciples of powerful sects. The disciples of powerful sects were extraordinary, and they belonged to the top of the pyramid on the Profound Wither Island; even the big sects were inferior when compared to them. This was why Lin Yun could recognize their identities with a mere glance.

But the big sect’s transcendent geniuses wouldn’t be at all inferior to transcendent geniuses from the powerful sects, it’s just that they would lose in numbers. Both parties who were fighting were from powerful sects, and Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling shocked upon seeing the two who were being ganged upon. Coincidentally, they were disciples of the Sword Sect, and even more coincidental enough, Lin Yun recognized the two of them and even had some ‘grudge’ against them.

They were Qin Tian and Zhang Ting. Qin Tian was aloof back in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and treated him with disdain, thinking that he was a mere frog in a well who couldn’t recognize his own position. Compared ot that, Zhang Ting ‘might’ be a little better. At the very least, he wasn’t a hypocrite like Qin Tian.

As for those ganging up on the Sword Sect’s disciples, they also had a pretty big origin. Judging from their clothes, they should be from the Profound Sky Sect. The Profound Sky Sect was an undisputed overlord in the Ancient Barren Domain, and their sect master was said to be the most talented person in the past millennium. Aside from the Radiant Sword Saint, no one could suppress him.

So others might fear the Sword Sect, but the Profound Sky Sect was definitely not amongst them. Those ganging up on Qin Tian and Zhang Ting were disciples of the Profound Sky Sect. All of them they were donning saint armor. When incorporating their martial techniques, they were shining brightly and emitted a terrifying power, especially the one leading the party, who was easily dealing with Qin Tian and Zhang Ting’s attacks. If it wasn’t for him, it wouldn’t be an issue for Qin Tian to leave with his strength.

“Looks like the Sword Sect has really declined over the years…” The youth leading the party suddenly unleashed a golden sun with a wave of his hand, which was heading towards Qin Tian and Zhang Ting. This was the holy spirit martial technique of their Profound Sky Sect, the Nine Dawn Transformation’s first transformation, Rising Dawn.

This was a powerful attack, and it looked as though there was a rising sun in the palm of that youth’s hand. This made Lin Yun surprised because he could tell that the Profound Sky Sect was so strong that even one of their ordinary disciples was so extraordinary. If he had guessed it right, this youth shouldn’t be a transcendent genius, but his aura wasn’t any weaker to one.

“It’s the Profound Sky Canon.” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded within Lin Yun’s mind. After a brief pause, she continued, “If I remember correctly, the Profound Sky Canon was famous even in the ancient era. The complete Profound Sky Canon was one of the top ten cultivation techniques in the ancient era. The attack that he’s using right now should be a secret technique recorded in the Profound Sky Canon, and the Profound Sky Canon is a comprehensive cultivation technique with lots of secret techniques in each stage.”

Hearing what she said, Lin Yun now knew why the Profound Sky Sect could rise so quickly. He couldn’t help taking a few more glances at the attack. When the youth leading the party unleashed his attack, both Qin Tian and Zhang Ting’s constellations broke apart as they fell to the ground and threw out a mouthful of blood.

“Zhao Ling, aren’t you taking it a little too far? I’ve already given you the quasi-saint elixir, so what more do you want?!” Zhang Ting cursed with flames of rage blazing in his pupils. Not only did the Profound Sky Sect take the advantage of numbers to bully them, they even wanted to humiliate them even after they obtained the quasi-saint elixir.

But when Zhang Ling heard what Zhang Ting said, he merely stood there and wore a playful smile.

“There’s nothing I can say since I lost to you. But give me some face. How about I give you two quasi-saint elixirs and we call this matter off?” Qin Tian said while gritting his teeth. He and Zhang Ling were both on the Empyrean Ranking, and they weren’t too far away from each other. So he was confident that Zhang Ling would give him some face.

Zhang Ling’s eyes flashed with mockery, as if he had heard the greatest joke of the century. A long time later after he calmed down, he smiled, “Give you some face? Who the hell do you think you are? Even if I let you have one hand against me, you still won’t be my opponent!”

“You!” Qin Tian raged with his face becoming ugly.

“Do you think you’re on the same level as me?” Zhang Ling’s eyes flashed with disdain and continued, “I might give you some face when we were all at the Empyrean Realm, but who do you think you are now? We’re both at the Elysium Core Realm, but you don’t even have the strength to make it on the Elysium Core Ranking now, right? You might be someone on the Empyrean Ranking, but you’re just a piece of garbage after reaching the Elysium Core Realm!”

Qin Tian’s mind blew when he heard that. At the same time, all his pride and arrogance began to collapse like shattered ice, and he could feel a chill down his spine. What Zhang Ling said was too ruthless. He had always been the center of attention and didn’t place anyone in his eyes aside from his senior brother. But the huge gap in their strengths when facing Zhang Ling made him feel terrible.

“Feeling unconvinced? Sorry, but there’s nothing you can do even if you’re feeling unconvinced!” Zhang Ling said before his constellation radiated brightly, forcing Qin Tian and Zhang Ting onto their knees. They tried their best to struggle, but there was nothing they could do with their constellations breaking apart.

Even Lin Yun began to feel bad for the two of them. Although he didn’t have any favorable impressions of them, he felt bad seeing the two of them being humiliated. Should he pretend that he didn’t see it? After all, it wouldn’t matter much to him, even if the two of them died.

“Well, I’ll be joining the Sword Sect, sooner or later.” Lin Yun closed his eyes and recalled what Ye Ziling said. If it was her, she definitely would help out.

When Lin Yun reopened his eyes, he already made his decision and pushed his palm out. His palm was enveloped in starlight as it flew out.

Zhang Ling noticed that and retaliated with a palm. When the two attacks collided, Zhang Ling squinted his eyes because the power contained within the other party’s attack had far exceeded his imagination, so it made him suffer some loss and he was forced to take several steps back.

“Who’s there?” Everyone from the Profound Sky Sect became alert, and began to look around.

Spreading his arms apart, Lin Yun flew over in the blink of an eye and landed on a huge rock. His appearance instantly drew everyone’s attention.

“Give me some face and let them off. Do that and I won’t make things difficult for you guys,” said Lin Yun while he sat on the huge rock.

“Lin Yun?” Qin Tian and Zhang Ting struggled to get back on their feet. Lin Yun’s voice was familiar to them, and when they saw that it really was Lin Yun, they were both shocked. They didn’t expect that Lin Yun would come to save them when they were in trouble, and the corner of Zhang Ting’s lips couldn’t help twitching, wondering if Lin Yun was a fool.

Lin Yun was so arrogant back in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and he still dared to act with such arrogance? Didn’t he know how the word ‘death’ was written?

Back then, Qin Tian gave Mu Qingqing some face and didn’t go after Lin Yun. The two of them still had the ‘qualifications’ to stand before Zhang Ling, but Lin Yun, who was only at the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm, would only be instantly killed.

“Quasi-Elysium Core Realm?” Zhao Ling was briefly stunned before he laughed, “Qin Tian, is this fool also a disciple of your Sword Sect? I thought that you were already stupid enough, but I never thought that there was someone who was even more stupid than you. Looks like the Sword Sect has really declined. Who does he think he is, wanting me to give him some face. Hahaha!”

The other Profound Sky Sect’s disciples also laughed along with Zhang Ling. This was simply too hilarious. A mere Quasi-Elysium Core Realm wanted Zhang Ling to give him some face? This was no longer an issue with the face but the brain.

Zhang Ting and Qin Tian both wore awkward expressions, feeling that this was too embarrassing. They would rather be humiliated than embarrass the entire Sword Sect.

“Is it funny?” Lin Yun said while seated on the huge rock. For some reason, his voice made everyone feel a chill down their spines as they turned to look at Lin Yun’s terrifyingly calm face.

Their waves of laughter immediately stopped at their throats, and their faces instantly became ugly. The silence was terrifying, and the disciples of the Profound Sky Sect had sweat covering their backs. The longer they looked at Lin Yun, the more they were shocked. They couldn’t figure out what was going on.
