Chapter 469 - Jian Shisan

Emperor Qin’s rage instantly caused panic. Originally, everyone thought that the competition would end with Lin Yun becoming the champion. But no one had expected that it would come to this. Qin Yu died from running amok, but Emperor Qin blamed it on Lin Yun.

First, there was the Profound Yang Palace’s deacon, and now, the Heavenly Soul Realm’s Emperor Qin had joined in as well. This instantly placed a great pressure on the Sword Firmament Pavilion, especially Lin Yun. Emperor Qin’s killing aura was entirely focused on him as if he would be killed in the next second.

“You’re really ruthless. You already became the champion, but you still killed your opponent?” Ji Yun’s face turned dark when he saw Qin Yu turning into ashes. He was sent here to ensure Qin Yu’s safety, but his mission was ruined.

“Your Majesty, His Highness’ death has nothing to do with Lin Yun. No one is an idiot here and anyone can tell that Qin Yu died because he ran amok. How can you blame it on Lin Yun?” said Luo Feng with a grave expression.

“Are you trying to say that I’m muddle-headed?” said Emperor Qin with a sneer.

“I dare not, but you have to be reasonable!” Beads of sweat dripped down Luo Feng’s forehead because he could sense the dense killing intent from Emperor Qin. He felt so helpless because Emperor Qin had clearly lost his rationale from Qin Yu’s death. But even so, there was no way Luo Feng could take a step back.

“He killed a disciple of the Profound Yang Palace. There’s no exception for him even if he’s the champion. If you hinder the Profound Yang Palace’s deacon from performing his duty, the Sword Firmament Pavilion is going to be held responsible,” replied Emperor Qin with a cold look.

“Well said.” Wen Yanbo stood out from the crowd. “If the Profound Yang Palace pursues this matter, this won’t be just between the Sword Firmament Pavilion and the Profound Yang Palace, but the entire empire.”

“Emperor Qin is right. No matter what, Lin Yun has to be handed to the Profound Yang Palace. Otherwise, your Sword Firmament Pavilion will be standing against the entire empire,” said the Sword Cloud Pavilion’s elder. Shortly after, a few other sects spoke up, supporting Emperor Qin.

For a split second, everyone’s attention was on Lin Yun. Lin Yun should be enjoying the limelight because of his victory, but this scene caught everyone by surprise. Ji Yun and Emperor Qin’s strong stance had isolated Lin Yun. Now, everyone wanted to kill him.

Perhaps in their view, since the beginning, Lin Yun didn’t have the qualification to be the champion. The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party wore a grave expression because they never expected that the Profound Yang Palace and Emperor Qin would be so overbearing. So what should they do now? Cripple Lin Yun or hand him over? There was without question that the Profound Yang Palace and Emperor Qin had the strength to do that, so how should they respond?

“Hand over Lin Yun!” Ji Yun took a step forward, releasing his aura in the pinnacle Violet Palace Realm. It was actually not much weaker than Emperor Qin.

“What a powerful aura!”

“Is the Profound Yang Palace’s deacon going to punish Lin Yun now?”

“They’re too overbearing!”

Ji Yun grew even more arrogant with Emperor Qin’s support. He questioned the Sword Firmament Pavilion when he saw them protecting Lin Yun, “Is the Sword Firmament Pavilion going to stand against the Profound Yang Palace?”

The Profound Yang Palace was one of the overlords of the Ancient Southern Domain. Even if the empire combined with the four major sects, they couldn’t be compared to even a hundredth of what the Profound Yang Palace was. Even if Ji Yun was alone by himself, no one dared to utter a word about how overbearing he was.

“Get lost!” Ji Yun finally lost his patience and pushed his palm out. He was also using the Profound Yang Palm that Qin Yu had, but his was much more powerful. The palm caught Luo Feng by surprise and he was sent flying away, instantly tearing a hole in the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s formation.

“Anyone who hinders the Profound Yang Palace from performing our duties will be killed!” Ji Yun sneered and his gaze finally landed on Lin Yun. Shortly after, his figure flew out to grab Lin Yun.

It didn’t matter if Lin Yun was the champion because there was no way the Profound Yang Palace could let Lin Yun go after Qin Yu’s death. When his terrifying aura was released, the sky instantly turned dark.

When the crowd sensed the aura, cold sweat dripped down from their foreheads. The Profound Yang Palace was too overbearing and they were completely unreasonable. Qin Yu’s death had nothing to do with Lin Yun, but they wanted to kill Lin Yun just because Qin Yu was the Profound Yang Palace’s disciple?

No one could believe this, but there was no right and wrong in the world. Whoever had the tougher fist had the right to determine fate. So even if they sympathized with Lin Yun, they could only watch as Ji Yun knocked away the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s elders and headed towards Lin Yun.

“The Profound Yang Palace, how awe-inspiring.” A cold snort sounded out and rang in everyone’s ears. In the next second, a figure descended and landed on the stage. The man had white hair, ragged clothes, and a wrinkled face. He looked like a fisherman, but no one dared to underestimate him because his gaze felt as though he could see through everyone’s heart.

“There are rules around here, so you’ll have to ask me if you want to harm Lin Yun today!” The sudden appearance of the old man caused everyone’s hearts to tremble. They pondered on the old man’s identity since he could disregard the royal family and Profound Yang Palace to protect Lin Yun.

Countless gazes fell onto the old man and someone instantly cried out, “Jian Shisan!”

Many old men recognized the old man on the stage and their faces changed. After all, Jian Shisan was a legend in the empire, but no one actually thought he was still in the empire.

“Jian Shisan, that monstrous genius who rose to fame in the empire fifty years ago? Didn’t everyone say that he had already left the empire?”

“What a surprise that Jian Shisan is still alive and in the empire.”

Many old men were shocked because Jian Shisan was a legendary figure of their era. But he disappeared when he lost the fight with Jian Xuanhe to compete for the Pavilion Master’s position. Fifty years ago, he was a monstrous genius who ruled the empire’s younger generation with Jian Xuanhe. He was the source of many people’s nightmares since many of the old men present had suffered by his hands. Everyone was truly shocked by his appearance.

But even if Jian Shisan was a legend, it was a little too much for him to stand against the Profound Yang Palace. After all, the Profound Yang Palace was an overlord in the Ancient Southern Domain. Even if Ji Yun was a deacon, his strength was completely capable of making a Heavenly Soul Realm cultivator feel afraid, not to mention that Emperor Qin was around. So could Jian Shisan block Ji Yun?

“Get lost.” Ji Yun had never heard of Jian Shisan’s name. But he knew that Jian Shisan must be courting death to stand against his Profound Yang Palace. Instantly, Ji Yun threw a palm at Jian Shisan. This palm seemed as if it could grab the clouds.

However, Jian Shisan merely raised his sword to split the palm into two.

“This…” Ji Yun was shocked. He couldn’t believe that his attack was so easily resolved. Just who was this old man standing before him? When he looked at Jian Shisan, his gaze couldn’t help becoming stiff.

“It has been a long time since someone dared to speak in such a matter to me. You’re only a Profound Yang Palace’s deacon and you’re not even in the Heavenly Soul Realm. Yet, you dare to speak such words to me? Kneel!” Jian Shisan barked and his voice rang out along with his sword intent. It was domineering and it made Ji Yun feel like a huge mountain was crashing down on him. It was futile no matter how he struggled. In the end, he ultimately went down on his knees.

“Jian Shisan!” The hearts of everyone in the crowd were filled with shock because Jian Shisan’s strength had toppled everyone’s imagination.

“Senior, who are you? Please forgive me if I’ve offended you in any way, but I’m still a Profound Yang Palace’s deacon, so don’t push it!” Ji Yun said with his teeth gnashed. He no longer had the arrogance he had before.

“You deserve a slap.” Jian Shisan waved his hand through the air and Ji Yun was smacked to the point that he threw up a mouthful of blood. Then, he turned to Emperor Qin, “The envoy hasn’t even shown up, so what qualification do you have to try and hand Lin Yun a punishment?”

“The Dragon Gate Competition is the Dragon Gate Competition. But this is an affair of my Great Qin Empire and the envoy can’t interfere. Since the envoy hasn’t shown up, this means that he’s handing this matter to me. Qin Yu died, so Lin Yun has to die!” snorted Emperor Qin.

“You can try!” barked Jian Shisan. The atmosphere suddenly became dense, becoming more terrifying than before. After all, two Heavenly Soul Realm experts were about to fight.

“The dead cannot be revived. If Royal Father insists on causing a massacre and disregarding the empire’s commoners, then there’s no need for you to stay on the throne anymore,” said a gentle voice just when the atmosphere grew intense.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
