Chapter 2128: Silver Coffin

When the three entered the bronze gate, the interior was spacious, but there was no treasure besides a silver coffin at the center. Lin Yun examined it and noticed that there wasn’t anything special about the paintings on the walls.

“So this is a tomb.” Mo Li was calm. But the coffin was strange because it was silver and gave off a dazzling saint radiance. It didn’t seem lifeless but sacred instead. The surface of the coffin looked smooth, like snow, and the coffin was covered with mysterious diagrams. They didn’t seem to be the style of the Divine Dragon Era, but they contained many elements. There were golden threads woven into a floral crown, many vines, and stars that looked like a map or constellation.

“This coffin isn’t simple and might be a treasure.” Cao Yang said as he looked at the coffin with a heated gaze.

Mo Li said in disdain, “The Ancient Vajra Monastery is a Buddhist holy land. So why are you so desperate that you even wanted a coffin? If your master knows about it, he’ll probably kick you out.”

Cao Yang felt guilty but still stubbornly said, “I’m just talking about it casually, and I won’t do something so wicked!”

Lin Yun didn’t speak because he didn’t have a good impression of coffins. In many tombs, coffins and corpses were usually linked with the Demonspirit Clan. Either that, or they were demonic puppets, and none of them were pushovers.

“Let’s open it and take a look. This coffin exuded a sacred aura, and nothing shouldn’t be dangerous in it.” Cao Yang was frank as he stepped forth without any fear. The Buddhist Cult possessed many means to deal with supernaturals. So regardless of whether it was a demonic spirit or an evil corpse, Cao Yang naturally wouldn’t put them in his eyes.

He felt that this was his home ground. Even if anything happens, Lin Yun and Mo Li would be the unlucky ones here, not to mention he could use this opportunity to kill the two!

“Wait!” Mo Li’s face changed, and he called out to Cao Yang.

“It’s fine. The risks and rewards come together, and I’ll take the risk for you two,” Cao Yang smiled, pretending to be a retard as he opened the coffin. Everything happened so quickly that neither Lin Yun nor Mo Li could stop him.

But just when Cao Yang opened half of the coffin, the cover of the coffin flew out as a person stood up. The eye on his forehead opened up and shot out a silver beam, turning the surrounding environment eerie. This caught Cao Yang by surprise as the silver beam pierced through his chest, and he was sent flying out, throwing a mouthful of blood. Cao Yang was heavily injured in a split second, with his face becoming pale.

“Silver-Eyed Demonspirit!” Lin Yun, Cao Yang, and Mo Li took a deep breath with their faces changed.

“What the hell?! Why is this thing doing here?!” Cao Yang was terrified to death and was on the verge of crying. It was obvious how terrifying a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was. This meant the demonspirit was a Saint Realm expert when it was alive. Even after it was dead, it was a monster that could make any Quasi-Saint feel a headache. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In the blink of an eye, Cao Yang exchanged over a dozen moves with the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, executing various secret techniques of the Buddhist Cult. But his attacks were futile against the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

“Vajra Golden Physique!” Cao Yang was forced into a desperate strait and executed his strongest technique. As his body swelled, his clothes burst apart, revealing his golden skin. Cao Yang wanted to run but couldn’t because the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit focused on him. It didn’t take long before Cao Yang began to beg, “Big brothers, please save me!”

Cao Yang was regretful because he wanted to kill Lin Yun and Mo Li here, only to put himself in danger instead.

When Lin Yun and Mo Li were pondering if they should help, two smaller Silver-Eyed Demonspirits flew out from the coffin.

“Heavenly Note Saint Hand!” A giant figure manifested behind Mo Li, playing ancient music that sent the incoming demonspirit flying back.

At the same time, Mo Li charged forth. He released a golden radiance that formed into a huge bell above him. This was a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, and it released the music of greater dao when it rang. As lightning began to flicker on his hands, it formed into a dazzling bolt aimed at the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s neck.

This attack was too terrifying as it knocked the demonspirit flying back, clashing against the wall. He didn’t look like it, but he was a domineering and decisive person.

“Withered Tree Coming To Life!” Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword and poured his nirvana aura into the sword, unleashing a powerful sword ray that released various phenomena. Before the demonspirit could even get close, the sword ray had already sent it flying away, heavily injuring the demonspirit that seemed to have a skin as tough as saint artifacts.

Lin Yun and Mo Li exchanged looks and had a new understanding of each other’s strengths. But the situation hadn’t turned in their favor because the battle was ongoing.

When Cao Yang noticed that Lin Yun and Mo Li were held up, he became dispirited and no longer held back, summoning his constellation as an ancient Buddha with four heads and eight arms. Even so, he could only be beaten up by the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, ensuring it wouldn’t kill him. He could only hold his ground if he didn’t want to die until Lin Yun and Mo Li resolved their opponents.

The smaller Silver-Eyed Demonspirits were clearly weaker compared to the one Cao Yang was fighting. Even so, he was still barely holding his ground.

After spending a few minutes, Lin Yun and Mo Li finally resolved their opponents, beheading their opponents and stabbing them into their vertical eyes. This showed that Lin Yun and Mo Li were experienced in fighting the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

“Save me! Save me! Save me!” Cao Yang wailed.

“Let’s go.” Mo Li made a move as he controlled the bell to suppress the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. On the other hand, Lin Yun activated the two glory spirits in the Flower Burial Sword. As his sword aura began to increase, a dazzling golden and green radiance shot out from the sword.

The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit sent the bell flying away before the Flower Burial Sword flew over, pinning the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit onto the wall.

Cao Yang swallowed a pellet after being free and said hatefully, “Damn it, this is a Saint Realm demonspirit.”

Lin Yun and Mo Li naturally noticed it without needing him to say any further. Lin Yun said, “We can only suppress it, and it’s too hard to kill him.”

The Flower Burial Sword was buzzing because the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was trying to resist, and the Astral Sword Intent couldn’t hold him down for long.

“You people restrain him. I’ll deal with them!” Cao Yang said furiously.

“Okay.” Lin Yun and Mo Li were decisive as they immediately made a move. Lin Yun sat down with his hands clasped together with multiple galaxies empowering the Flower Burial Sword, pinning down the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

Mo Li retrieved an ancient zither, using the Thunderbale Demonic Note in the Heavenly Note Demonic Canon to attack the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. He was cautious, and the bell hovered above his head to be prepared for accidents.

“Black Sacred Flame Lotus!” Cao Yang roared as a black ‘卍’ seal flew out from his hand and landed on the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. The terrifying flames made the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit wail out in pain, and Lin Yun could sense a stronger struggle coming from the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

“Ordinary sacred flames can’t kill you, but the Black Sacred Flame Lotus is meant to deal with your monsters. Die!” Cao Yang’s forehead was covered in sweat as he vented his grievance. Ultimately, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was incinerated until a skeleton was left.
