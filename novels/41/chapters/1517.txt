Chapter 1518 - Last Level

Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet, and fell into deep thought while looking at those dragons. He knew this pellet probably had a considerable origin, or Tian Jue wouldn’t be so emotional.

“Empress, what’s the effect of this pellet?”

“That’s the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet. If someone in the Dragon Pulse Realm refines it, it would be a huge opportunity for them. In a nutshell, it can strengthen one’s dragon pulses, which means that the dragon origin born in the body will also become more terrifying. If you want more accurate information, it can help you condense dragon origin in the first pulse!”

Lin Yun briefly pondered before he asked, “Is it hard to condense dragon origin?”

“It’s not hard for you because of your terrifying accumulation at the Elysium Core Realm. There’s a high chance that you can condense dragon origin at the first pulse. But most people can only manage to condense dragon origin after reaching the second or third pulse. You don’t know how lucky you are, regardless of the resources given to you by the Sword Sect or your accumulation in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.” The empress’ voice resounded. “This Divine Dragon Creation Pellet can help you shake off many people in the Dragon Pulse Realm, and you’ll know more about the benefits after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm.”

It could only be used after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm? There is still a long way to go. Stowing the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet, Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to head to the next level and sat down to recover from his injuries. He suffered severe injuries in his battle with Tian Jue, especially the last attack from Tian Jue that shattered all of Lin Yun’s dragon runes.

His injuries would only have become heavier if he didn’t have the Golden Crow Wings that blocked the last attack. Aside from Xiao Fan, this was the first time Lin Yun saw such a powerful bladesman amongst the same generation.

While Lin Yun was recovering from his injuries, the Netherworld Hall’s Murong Chen indifferently looked at the box before him, watching the seal slowly being lifted. Before the seal was lifted, no one would know what treasure it contained.

But no matter what, anything that could be placed in the eighth level was a valuable treasure, and the value was higher than all the treasures from the previous levels, and there were also lesser halls on the eighth level.

Murong Chen opened the box with a finger flick when the seal was lifted. When the box was opened, there was a black twelve-petaled flower covered in floral runes and emitting pure nether energy. As waves of pure nether energy emitted from the flora, it also emitted a charming fragrance.

Once the entire hall was filled with the floral fragrance, it created all sorts of phenomena, and Murong Chen couldn’t maintain his composure when he saw this flower. He could feel his heart beating wildly, and his eyes were filled with disbelief because it was a Netherflower, and he even wondered if he was dreaming.

It contained the purest nether energy in the world, the legendary sacred treasure of the Netherworld Hall. The Netherworld Hall once had three Netherflowers, but they were almost withered. This was because they didn’t have any nether water to water the Netherflowers. After all, the nether sea was destroyed in the battle between deities, becoming one of the nine forbidden zones in the Kunlun Realm.

It was a region that not even saints dared to step into. But he now had a Netherflower, which was fate and an opportunity for him. As Murong Chen’s pupils blazed with flames, his eyes radiated with his ambitions because he could become the disciple of the Heartless Demon Emperor if he became the holy son, “Is it fate that I’ll be a holy son?”

If Murong Chen had to choose between a Divine Dragon Bone and a Netherflower, he would definitely pick the latter. He would stick to this choice no matter what, and he would benefit greatly if he could leave with the Netherflower. But only a child would choose, and a grown man would take it all!

As Murong Chen began to laugh at the thought of this, a person walked into the hall, and he was Chen Kui of the Hundred Ghost Gate. His pupils were also blazing with flames of greed and excitement when he saw the Netherflower.

“Chen Kui, you want to compete with me for it?” Murong Chen’s smile disappeared from his face.

“Ha!” Chen Kui smiled.

Murong Chen squinted his eyes and warmly smiled, “You know how much this Netherflower means to me. Let me have this, and I won’t compete with you for the Divine Dragon Bone. I can even help you once.”

He was naturally lying because he naturally wouldn’t give up on the Divine Dragon Bone. Then again, it would be best to avoid fighting before reaching the ninth level.

“I’m sorry, but I never make a choice!” Chen Kui said. “The Netherflower is mine, and the Divine Dragon Boen is also mine.”

The Netherflower would also benefit him greatly. So how could Chen Kui give up on it?

“Well said. It has been many years since the Netherflower last appeared. So we naturally have to fight for it.” A burst of laughter resounded when Chen Kui and Murong Chen faced off. The Demonfiend Sect’s Yan Xuan appeared, wielding the Blood Demonfiend Blade. He was enveloped in a crimson demonic light with crimson flames blazing in his pupils.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He seemed to have refined some sort of treasure, and this was why he was enveloped in a demonic aura. The aura he was giving off was terrifying.

The smile on Murong Chen’s face disappeared when he realized he couldn’t resolve this matter peacefully, so he coldly said, “You two are courting death. You two can come at me together!”

The battle instantly broke out when Murong Chen wanted to face two enemies simultaneously.

In another hall, the Blood Moon Sect’s Ling Qianye was in a passage. He wasn’t lucky because he couldn’t find the hall and had to make several detours. Suddenly, surprise flashed through his pupils, and he saw an unexpected someone in the passage.

It was Tian Jue. The current Tian Jue looked terrible, and he was seated on the ground, healing his injuries. When he secretly got close, Ling Qianye noticed that Tian Jue had a terrifying sword wound on his chest, and the sword intent lingering in his wounds kept corroding his astral energy; this gave Tian Jue trouble while trying to heal his injuries.

“What a powerful attack!” Ling Qianye was surprised, and he asked, “You ran into Qin An?”

Qin An was the chief disciple of the Seven Absolute Palace, and he had the highest attainment in the sword amongst them. Aside from that, Ling Qianye couldn’t think of anyone having a more powerful sword intent than Qin An.

When Tian Jue opened his eyes, he wasn’t surprised to see Ling Qianye. His face was bitter because he knew he would face the other chief disciples on the eighth level. But he never expected that he would run into Ling Qianye in such a pathetic state.

“Kill me.” Tian Jue said. None of the chief disciples were good people, and Tian Jue wasn’t one either. If he ran into someone else who was as heavily injured like he was, he wouldn’t hesitate to kill them. After all, anyone who could reach the eighth level definitely obtained a lot of treasures, and he didn’t believe that Ling Qianye wasn’t tempted.

“Looks like it’s not Qin An…” Ling Qianye smiled. “Tell me who injured you, and I’ll spare your life.”

The corner of Tian Jue’s lips twitched because he really didn’t want to say it.

“Actually, I can guess even if you don’t tell me. It’s the guest of your Heavenly Astral Pavilion, right?” Ling Qianye smiled.

“How did you know?” Tian Jue was shocked.

“I actually didn’t, but I am certain now.” Ling Qianye smiled. “His name is Lin Tian, right? He might have a low cultivation, but his sword intent is blazing bright like flames, and it’s impossible for anyone to not notice it. But it looks like his strength has exceeded my expectations for him to injure you so heavily.”

Tian Jue’s face was ugly when he heard that.

Ling Qianye smiled as he passed by Tian Jue, “Seeing that you contributed information to me, I’ll spare your life for now!”

But Tian Jue gritted his teeth with hatred when he saw this scene. Ling Qianye’s contemptuous gaze felt even more terrible than being killed by him, making flames blaze in his heart. His hatred for Lin Yun also reached an unprecedented height.

An hour later, Murong Chen defeated Chen Kui and Yan Xuan. He had a pair of crimson and silver wings behind him, while Yan Xuan and Chen Kui were lying on the ground with their blood dying the ground.

The two were covered with terrifying wounds. But fortunately, their injuries weren’t fatal, and they were looking at Murong Chen with reluctance in their eyes. Murong Chen’s hair was scattered as he tugged his arms together, his gaze becoming cold.

Waving his hand, the Netherflower flew out from the box and landed in his hand before storing it in his interspatial bracelet. His wings had blood dripping down, which naturally belonged to the two lying on the ground.

The saint armor that Chen Kui and Yan Xuan were wearing had no resistance against Murong Chen’s wings, and their defenses were penetrated in a split second. That pair of wings was too terrifying. Chen Kui and Yan Xuan speculated that the pair of wings probably contained ten thousand saint runes, and it was forged with Crimson Flames Agrium Metal.

“I’ll be heading to the ninth level first. The two of you can enjoy your time here.” Murong Chen smiled after stowing the Netherflower away. “This Blue Dragon Trial Tower is really a treasure. The two of you can cultivate here. Who knows, you guys might have a chance to make a breakthrough! Hahaha!”
