Chapter 1465: What Was He Trying To Do?

At the edge of the Celestial Observing Lake, a sword ray descended towards the lake's surface like a meteorite. The sword ray that looked like it could smash through mountains didn’t cause any splashes when it landed on the lake. Based on this alone, one could judge that this person had complete control of their sword aura.

“So… this is the Celestial Observing Lake?” The azure-robed swordsman muttered as he looked around. This person was naturally Lin Yun, who had been restrained for an hour.

Lin Yun still had no idea that because of him, Huangfu Yan’s father bet that if Lin Yun could make it into the top ten, he would drink all the water in the Celestial Observing Lake. As he stood on the lake's surface, Lin Yun looked around, and saw that the lake was massive. The lake's surroundings were empty, despite the number of people that came in.

After seeing the countless people heading towards the core region, Lin Yun reached out to grab an Azure Lotus Sword Flower. This should be the lowest ranked, grown on the edge of the lake. But even so, the competition here was still intense since Lin Yun couldn’t see any other Azure Lotus Sword Flower in the surroundings since they had been plucked.

Far away, the roars of demonic beasts could be heard, which meant that it wasn’t going to be easy to move forward. Azure Lotus Sword Flowers of at least the third grade were guarded by demonic beasts, and the air was thin here due to the sword aura in the surroundings.

So the further one went in, the greater the pressure they would feel. Simultaneously, the swordsman’s sword intent would be suppressed here. This was because the sword intent left behind by Yu Qingfeng had already claimed this region.

“This place is pretty interesting…” Lin Yun smiled as he toyed with the Azure Lotus Sword Flower in his hand. He could sense his blood boiling. He only had one path to take if he wanted to reach the top ten after being restricted for an hour; that was to obtain the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower at the core of the lake.

Whoever obtained the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower would be the champion. He was already an hour late, and he definitely wouldn’t be able to compete with those who entered earlier if he wanted to compete in quantity. But this also meant he had to face the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking. So he would have to risk it all, either become the champion, or he wouldn’t even be able to make it into the top hundred.

“Time the show the true strength of a heaven direct disciple!” Lin Yun took a deep breath and circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. As the Twelve-Petaled Netherflower bloomed, his astral energy became filled with nether energy before black sword rays burst out of his body. Turning into a streak of light, Lin Yun dashed forth, piercing the heads of any demonic beasts that stood in his way.

With the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra reaching the pinnacle of the third stage, the erosive trait became even more terrifying. Demonic beasts were born with a powerful physique, but none of them could withstand it.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“What pure sword intent!” Lin Yun took a deep breath and discovered that the sword intent here was so dense that it felt like spiritual energy. He could swallow a mouthful just by taking a breath, which was simply unheard of.

When he raised his head, he had no idea how far he was to the core of the lake due to the heavy fog. There was no question that the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower would be found at the core of the lake, and whoever could reach there first would have the initiative.

But Lin Yun was worried that the competition over the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower would come to an end before he even rushed over. So this meant that he had to speed up.

When he formed a seal, the Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him and his speed skyrocketed. Lin Yun didn’t take long to run into more Sword Sect disciples. Occasionally, he would find Azure Lotus Sword Flowers along the way, but he merely glanced at them. He was already determined to obtain the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower and compete with the others to become the champion. So he naturally wouldn’t waste any time here.

Suddenly, Lin Yun could sense his sword intent being suppressed by a level. The sword aura in the surroundings was as thick as an abyss, giving off a feeling that he could touch it just by reaching out. Furthermore, the demonic beasts blocking the way gradually increased to an alarming number.

This should be the depths of the Celestial Observing Lake, and crossing this region meant he would leave the edge of the lake. Lin Yun briefly paused before he gathered his astral energy and threw out a punch, executing the Divine Solar Lunar Fist—Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron.

His fist turned into a huge cauldron with the sun and moon engraved on it and tore apart all the demonic beasts that had gathered in front of him. Although the Divine Solar Lunar Fist could no longer keep up with him in Lin Yun’s view, it was still sufficient to deal with these demonic beasts.

After he slightly raised his brow, he dashed forth in a flash, making him look like a sword ray that was streaking across the horizon.

“What terrifying speed!”

“Who is he? Isn’t he a little too violent?”

“Holy shit, almost thirty Elysium Core Realm demonic beasts were swept away with one punch.” Nearly all the disciples that were fighting for third-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flowers were shocked when they witnessed this scene. But Lin Yun was too fast, and they could only see a streak of light flashing past.

Everyone already knew that the Celestial Observing Lake wasn’t peaceful, and many weaker disciples thought of giving up and chose to compete for third-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flowers, instead. Even if they couldn’t obtain a rank, it was a decent harvest if they could obtain some Azure Lotus Sword Flowers.

The place that Lin Yun had just passed through was a dividing line. He would run into fourth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flowers if he crossed it, which meant that this was where the competition between the five peaks was the most intense. Moving forward, the elites of the five peaks were competing hard amongst themselves.

Those in the top ten of the Earth Ranking were like arrows as they headed straight to the core of the lake. They only had one objective: the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. Thus, the fight over the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower might fall into utter chaos.

There would definitely be a fight between Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi, and such a chaotic fight wasn’t the first time. Both sides were familiar with each other since they were rivals. So they naturally knew what the other party was thinking about.

An hour later, Lin Yun could sense another pressure of sword aura falling onto him, making his face slightly change. When he raised his head, he could vaguely see the core of the lake’s true appearance. The core of the lake might seem calm, but the pressure from it was immense. It felt as though he was facing a majestic sword.

While Lin Yun was in deep thought, several figures flew out from the fog ahead of him. Ten-odd people threw out mouthfuls of blood as they fell onto the lake's surface with their faces turning pale.

“It’s too powerful. We can’t get in.”

“The sword aura has reached a level that not even three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realms can enter so easily.”

“This is nothing. Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan are real monsters. Even a monarch demonic beast at the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm couldn’t last against an attack from them and was immediately annihilated.”

“I had no idea how strong those two were, and I suspect the rumors might be true.” The group wiped the blood off the corner of their lips. They also tried to enter the core region to compete with those in the top ten of the Earth Ranking. Even if they couldn’t obtain the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower, it wouldn’t be bad if they could obtain several eighth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flowers. But who would’ve thought that they weren’t strong enough to get any Azure Lotus Sword Flowers?

While they were talking, another group flew out from the fog and wildly threw out blood. But when they landed on the ground, they quickly lost consciousness. There were also a few who retained their consciousness, but they were shivering in fear.

“What’s wrong?”

“You guys failed to enter the core region as well?” Someone from the first group quickly came forth and asked. They were shocked because the strength of this group was close to the top ten of the Earth Ranking. So it was unbelievable that they couldn’t even make it to the core region.

“It’s impossible. You must be able to truly block Yu Qingfeng’s sword to enter the core region.” Someone replied, and the surroundings fell into silence. They didn’t think that it would be so terrifying that one needed to block Yu Qingfeng’s sword if they wanted to enter the core region.

Even if it was a sword intent left behind by Yu Qingfeng three thousand years ago, it wasn’t something they could block. As for the specifics, that person couldn’t explain it that well. Several people refused to believe it. They charged straight forth and even summoned their constellations.

This time, everyone could clearly see as a sword ray swept those people out. Even their constellations were cut into two as they flew a few thousand meters away.

They soon concluded that the core region couldn’t be recklessly intruded. But just when everyone was feeling uncertain, a sword ray approached and landed before the heavy fog. Since that person was wrapped in black sword rays, no one could make out his appearance. But that pair of golden wings practically gave him away.

“Lin Yun!” An uproar burst from the surroundings. Lin Yun had barely managed to keep up with the footsteps of those in the top ten of the Earth Ranking. They were shocked by this speed, which made them wonder if Lin Yun didn’t collect any Azure Lotus Sword Flowers along the way and focused on rushing over; this instantly made everyone wonder what Lin Yun was trying to do.
