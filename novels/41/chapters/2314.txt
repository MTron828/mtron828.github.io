Chapter 2315 - Phoenix And Youth

Lin Yun smiled and followed Ji Zixi to the bottom of the lake. The lake was close to a thousand meters deep, and the bottom was brightly lit when light shone into the lake. But the light was scattered, and fish could be seen swimming around. Since there weren’t any disturbances or predators, life in the lake flourished.

This wasn’t Ji Zixi’s first time here, so she brought Lin Yun around and even rode those fish. When exhausted, Ji Zixi brought Lin Yun to a dark sea region.

With a wave of her hand, a light barrier appeared in the sea region, allowing them to walk as if on the ground. There was a pair of Azure Bird skeletons lying on the ground. Ji Zixi said sorrowfully, “This is where the Azure Birds died.”

“You have other motives for bringing me here, right?” Lin Yun asked.

Ji Zixi wore a smile, and said, “Big Brother Lin is brilliant. I want Big Brother Lin to play the Phoenix Heart Song. The Azure Birds also possessed the Phoenix Bloodline, and I believe they will be happy to hear it.”

“I don't see why not,” Lin Yun smiled.

Ji Zixi said, “Okay. I also want to use the Phoenix Heart Song to consolidate my cultivation.”

Lin Yun waved his hand and took out the Thunderstorm Zither from his interspatial bracelet. When the music resounded, Lin Yun gave off a faint yellow radiance that looked like a moon at the bottom of the lake.

The Phoenix Heart Song was an ancient song of the Divine Phoenix Clan that could cleanse the hearts of others and aid cultivation, especially those possessing the Phoenix Bloodline. The effects would be multiplied for them.

Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto Ji Zixi, who sat and gave off a dazzling radiance. He realized he couldn’t see through her cultivation, meaning she was at least a fifth-stage Saint Lord. If she released her Divine Phoenix Wings, the pressure would further increase, which was the advantage of her bloodline.

He felt he might run into many bloodline cultivators in the Heavenly Barren Realm, and things might become unpredictable.

“Mhm?” Lin Yun exclaimed as he discovered that the two skeletons were slowly disappearing, giving off a radiance. When Lin Yun finished playing the Phoenix Heart Song, the skeletons had disappeared. While Lin Yun felt shocked, the two Azure Birds’ souls appeared from the ashes, letting out a joyful cry as they flew towards Lin Yun to express their gratitude.

Lin Yun smiled and realized that the Phoenix Heart Song could calm the soul.

“It’s beautiful,” Ji Zixi was surprised when she opened her eyes. After the two Azure Birds’ saint souls flew around, they flew towards Ji Zixi. Perhaps because Ji Zixi came here often, they recognized her. They flew around her and weren't willing to leave.

“Haha!” Ji Zixi smiled as the two saint souls entered her bracelet. She happily ran over and raised her hand with the bracelet on. She said, “Big Brother Lin! Look! Quick, look!”

“I see it,” Lin Yun smiled.

“The legend is true! I told my father in the past that they died because of love, but my father said that they died naturally. He can’t bluff me now!” Ji Zixi said excitedly. She didn’t notice what the two Azure Birds’ saint souls meant. The bracelet itself was a Glory Saint Artifact. Now that there were two saint souls in it, it could grow into a Sovereign Saint Artifact, one that solely belonged to her.

“Hehe, they can stay with me in the future and accompany me. They told me to thank you on their behalf,” Ji Zixi said excitedly.

They soon left Mirror Lake, and Ji Zixi gently shook her bracelet as a carriage descended from the sky. She entered the carriage and invited, “Big Brother Lin, come on. I’ll show you around.”

After Lin Yun took a step towards the carriage, he wasn’t hurrying to enter and silently looked at Ji Zixi. A long time later, after Ji Zixi became uncomfortable under his gaze, Lin Yun said, “Zixi, I believe you have something to tell me.”

“What?” Ji Zixi’s smile disappeared, then she asked, “Big Brother Lin, you already knew?”

Lin Yun nodded, “The holy master has told me about the Heavenly Barren Realm.”

“I… I told my father not to tell you about it,” Ji Zixi said furiously.

“As a father, he’s naturally worried for his daughter’s safety, and it’s understandable,” Lin Yun smiled. He continued, “I have already agreed with him. Don’t worry about it because your father didn’t force me. I’m going there willingly.”

The Heavenly Barren Realm contained both dangers and opportunities. There was naturally nothing to say about the dangers since he would die there if he wasn't careful. After all, the brutality there would be on a whole new level since there would be many geniuses from other eras participating there. Even if he could survive, he wouldn’t be able to return if he couldn’t receive the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity’s acknowledgment.

But there were also opportunities. He could take this opportunity to eliminate his disadvantage in cultivation. So, if he could return to the Kunlun Realm, his strength would have undergone a drastic transformation. At that time, he would even be able to face those from the older generation who were a few hundred years old.

“Is that all…?” Ji Zixi asked, looking a little disappointed.

Lin Yun smiled, “We’re also good friends, and I hope you can survive. I don’t want to see you die so far away from home.”

Ji Zixi smiled, “I’m not as weak as my father thinks. Even if someone comes with me, I won’t be happy. But I’m naturally happy that Big Brother Lin is willing to come with me. I was originally planning…”

“Planning to bring me around for a few days before saying your farewell? Isn’t that a little too cruel?” Lin Yun smiled. He played around the Divine Phoenix Mountain with Ji Zixi until nightfall before returning to the Stream Cloud Residence, where he saw Lil’ Purple. They looked at each other, and he asked, seeing that her expression wasn’t right, “Empress, what’s the matter?”

“You don’t blame me?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Blame you for what?” Lin Yun was baffled.

“Actually, the holy master guessed my identity when you displayed Nirvana Dao, and I also knew that he had guessed my identity,” Lil’ Purple said.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s nothing big. Furthermore, didn’t you say you can deal with Divine Phoenix Mountain as you want? You were almighty today,” Lin Yun smiled.

“That’s nothing. This is nothing compared to my prime,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“Let’s go into the topic. What did the holy master tell you?” Lin Yun asked.

“He told me the news about the other Sovereign Divine Runes. The Freezing Chill Divine Rune is in the hands of the Ice Emperor, the Samsara Divine Rune is in the Eastern Sea’s Astral Island, and only the location of the Nirvana Divine Rune is unknown,” Lil’ Purple said. “I have a plan and won’t accompany you to the Heavenly Barren Realm. I will stay behind to refine the Sinful Fire Divine Rune and search for the other Sovereign Divine Runes. So even if you can’t return, I will help you look after your master’s tribulation. I will treat your master like how I treat you.”

Lin Yun was shocked, before he asked, “Why?”

“Didn’t you say that I have a small heart? I don’t have a small heart. I’m just feeling heartache for you,” Lil’ Purple smiled. She continued, “The Heavenly Barren Realm is dangerous, and I can’t make you leave behind any regrets if you can’t return.”

“I got it. You’re afraid I won’t return and will take a huge risk in the Heavenly Barren Realm,” Lin Yun replied.

Lil’ Purple nodded and sighed, “It’s not a bad thing if you don’t return, but I know you’re worried about your master. So I want to ensure that you don’t leave any regrets behind.”

Lin Yun was touched and held onto Lil’ Purple’s hand. He said, “Don’t worry about me. I promise that I will return.”

“I’ll wait for you!” Lil’ Purple smiled. “You must know that you have me, Su Ziyao, Ye Guhan, your mistresses, the holy master, your martial brothers, and many more people waiting for you. We’re all working towards one goal: to help the Radiant Sword Saint make it through his tribulation. So you don’t have to bear everything on your shoulders since everyone will wait for you. Since we trust you, you can also trust us.”

“I believe in you guys,” Lin Yun replied.

“This is too serious, and we’re sounding like we will be parted with life and death. When I see this kind of atmosphere in books, it’s usually not far from the end,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“If there’s an outcome, what kind do you want?” Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling as well.

Lil’ Purple briefly pondered, then sighed, “I want many things, but as long as it’s not a separation by life and death.”

Lin Yun was filled with emotions as he looked at Lil’ Purple. He remembered when he first met Lil’ Purple, she was cheerful and adorable. He remembered her laughter in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, how she was forced to make herself seem ugly because of Ye Ziling, how she quietly waited for him to tie braids, and how she introduced herself with her long title.

“What are you thinking about?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“I feel that time passes really quickly, and it has already been so many years in the blink of an eye…” Lin Yun sighed. “You seem to have grown up a lot, and I’m no longer the same youth as I was before. Flower Burial has now become the Flower Burial Sword Saint.”

“No one will stay eighteen forever, and don’t you still stay true to your heart?” Lil’ Purple smiled. “In my eyes, you’re still that hot-blooded and invincible youth standing at the peak of the Heavenly Path.”

Lin Yun smiled, “In my eyes, you’re still that crybaby phoenix, but anyone will have to ask my sword if they want to bully you!”

“Hmph!” Lil’ Purple’s lip rose into a smug expression.
