Chapter 1923 - There's Something Wrong With You

While calling Lil’ Purple back, Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to discuss the Celestial Purging Mountain with her. He asked, “What’s the matter with the Flower Burial Sword?”

This was weird because Flower Burial belonged to him, and it used to be the sword of the Southern Emperor. Now that it was promoted to a Glory Saint Artifact, it made no sense that someone could draw it out without his permission. Then again, it was a different story if it was a Saint trying to draw the sword. If someone who didn’t receive the recognition of the Flower Burial Sword tries to pull it out, it would only be a futile attempt, no matter how they tried.

“Perhaps your sword is a scumbag like you,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

Hearing what Lil’ Purple said, the Flower Burial Sword began vibrate on Lin Yun’s lap to express dissatisfaction.

“Ha. It’s interesting for a sword to have a temper,” Lil’ Purple smiled, wanting to take the Flower Burial Sword away.

But Lin Yun stopped her by pressing down on the Flower Burial Sword.

Raising her head, Lil’ Purple smiled, “Maybe it’s as you said, she’s your ‘fated woman’. Reincarnation and fate might seem fake, but they do exist.”

“She still wanted my life back on the Celestial Purging Mountain and was trying to probe me. Furthermore, she has been investigating the Solar Lunar Divine Rune. Ye Qingtian was bewitched by her before and sneaked into the Celestial Pool,” Lin Yun said.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Lil’ Purple was stunned before she replied, “Then there’s something weird about that woman. She keeps finding you, probably because she is afraid of you. Ye Qingtian definitely knew about some of her secrets, and she’s trying to silence you because she’s not sure if Ye Qingtian is dead or alive.”

Lin Yun nodded his head. Wang Muyan had a headache. He didn’t expect Ye Qingtian, who didn’t seem to possess any existence, to hold some secrets. But he had already died, and there was no way Lin Yun could find out the truth. He now realized that the identity his senior brother prepared for him was troublesome because the two holy maidens were giving him a headache.

“The reason why I can draw out the Flower Burial Sword is because I’m a phoenix. A phoenix is a divine beast, and I’m born noble. So I can even easily draw out a Sovereign Saint Artifact,” Lil’ Purple said. She held onto her chin and guessed, “Since she can draw it out, does she also have a similar bloodline?”

“Perhaps…”

“Hehe. You don’t have to be so troubled about that. Just find an opportunity to capture her and interrogate her about it. I also want to know how much she knows about the Solar Lunar Divine Rune…” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“We can give that a try.” Lin Yun acknowledged. No matter what, it didn’t feel good being eyed by Wang Muyan. If he had no other way, he would really consider taking some special means.

“Let’s put that aside for now. She’s the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden and different from Zhang Yue,” Lin Yun said. “Let me ask you, do you have a way of ascending the fifth level?”

“This… Since you can use external objects, you can consider using your treasures when there’s no one around, since you have so many of them,” Lil’ Purple replied.

“That won’t work.” Lin Yun did consider that, but the exhaustion of using Glory Saint Artifacts was too great, and he had to face endless spiritual puppets. Regardless of the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, Black Tortoise Chains, or the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads, he wouldn’t last long with them.

Even the Glory Saint Artifacts that Wang Muyan and Bai Shuying used were weapons they often used. Hence, the exhaustion was naturally lesser than using Glory Saint Artifacts they weren’t familiar with. This was the same as Lin Yun using the Flower Burial Sword. But he couldn’t multitask with the Flower Burial Sword, resisting the pressure and spiritual puppets along the way.

“Perhaps you can give music a try?” Lil’ Purple suggested.

“Music? Wait…” Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled, “I have a solution now.”

“What solution?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“I’m not telling you what it is, hahaha!” Lin Yun rubbed her head with his pupils shining brightly. He was confident that he could reach the fifth level this time.

“Hmph, you scumbag. I have to make another trip to the Nether Orchid Courtyard at night. I have to take a trip to the Celestial Pool…” Lil’ Purple muttered, holding onto her chin.

“No. The Celestial Pool is a forbidden ground, and it’s easy for you to be exposed. Let me find a way,” Lin Yun said.

“So you’re promising me you’ll make a trip to the Celestial Pool?” Lil’ Purple smiled cunningly.

Lin Yun’s face became black, and felt as though he was tricked. How could he possibly go to the Celestial Pool? If someone saw him, he would be finished and unable to explain himself, no matter what. Let’s not mention the Celestial Pool, but he couldn’t even go to the Nether Orchid Courtyard if he wanted to.

“Hmph, you have already given me your promise. So you can’t go against your promise!” Lil’ Purple said.

When night came, Lin Yun headed to the Celestial Purging Mountain while Lil’ Purple went to investigate the Solar Lunar Divine Rune within the Nether Orchid Courtyard with Lil’ Red.

 

Meanwhile, Zhang Yue tried his best to persuade the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign within the Dao Yang Palace. He said in an anxious voice, “Master, we can really give it a try. Ye Qingtian is very suspicious, and there’s a possibility that he might no longer be the old Ye Qingtian and is someone in disguise. Even his fellow clansman, Ye Feifan, agreed with me.”

“You think Saint Elders like us are blind? We already suspected him long ago, but we can’t find any flaws in his disguise. We even used Saint Eyes during the day, but still can’t see anything wrong with him. In our eyes, he’s Ye Qingtian,” the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign sighed.

“How is that possible? How can he possibly make so many improvements in just one year?!” Zhang Yue questioned in disbelief. It was just as Wang Muyan had said; even the Saint Elders couldn’t tell anything was wrong with Ye Qingtian. He anxiously said, “But there’s clearly something wrong with him!”

When the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign saw that Zhang Yue still had no intentions of giving up, he roared, “In my eyes, there’s something wrong with you. No matter what Ye Qingtian does, he’s only a little cocky and won’t walk around with a Sky Pillar Pellet like you.”

The corner of Zhang Yue’s lips twitched. The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign was his master, and he didn’t dare to say anything about it, aside from apologizing. The Sky Pillar Pellet had become his nightmare, and even the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign became a joke because of it.

“Did you know that you have become a joke? Whenever I step out, a Saint Elder would ask me to borrow a Sky Pillar Pellet, and they even said that I must be the one who refined the Sky Pillar Pellet for you!” The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign scolded.

“Master, you really refined it for them?” Zhang Yue asked.

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign was stumped before throwing out a mouthful of blood. He said, “You have always been an intelligent person. So why have you become so stupid after encountering Ye Qingtian?”

Zhang Yue knew he was in the wrong and lowered his head.

“Why did they ask me to borrow Sky Pillar Pellets? Isn’t it all because of you becoming a laughingstock?!” The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign roared. He waved his hand, “Get lost. Don’t care about anything else and focus on defeating Ye Qingtian three days from now.”

Zhang Yue raised his head but wasn’t in a hurry to leave. He waited for the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign to calm down before asking, “Master, can anyone grasp six sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword in one year? If Ye Qingtian is really that talented, why didn’t he show it before? How can half a Saint Origin possibly be so magical?”

“I don’t believe it either, but there’s nothing I can do since I can’t tell anything wrong with him. Not to mention that he has become the disciple of the Dragon Origin Great Saint, and I can only choose to believe it,” the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign sighed.

Zhang Yue inwardly rejoiced when he saw this scene. So it turned out that his master was the same as him. He said, “Master, since you also suspect him, why don’t I use some means to probe him? If a Quasi-Saint makes a move against him, he will surely reveal something.”

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign helplessly sighed, “You’re foolish. You’ll be fine if he’s really Ye Qingtian. But how will you clean up the mess if he’s not?”

“He’s naturally a spy, then. We can cripple and question his motive for sneaking into the Heavenly Dao Sect!” Zhang Yue said excitedly.

“Then he’ll say that he’s under disguise because of the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s orders. Are you going to get me to look for the Dragon Origin Great Saint?” The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign smiled.

“That works,” Zhang Yue smiled embarrassedly, sensing something wasn’t right.

“Fool!” The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign roared, “Have you taken too much Sky Pillar Pellet that you’ve become a fool? You also want me to look for the Dragon Origin Great Saint? So that the Dragon Origin Great Saint can kill me with one finger before slapping you to death?!”

His words were a little exaggerated, but they further proved the position of a Great Saint within the Heavenly Dao Sect. As long as the two sword wielders didn’t stand out, a Great Saint had a noble position within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and only a Great Saint could curb another Great Saint.

Tu You was a Saint Sovereign and had a high status amongst the Saint Elders, but that didn’t mean he dared to face a Great Saint. Even if he had his reasons, he would only suffer in the end.

Tu You’s roar covered Zhang Yue’s back in sweat, and he helplessly said, “Does that mean that we really can’t do anything about him? But there’s clearly something wrong about him…”

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign stood up and paced around before smiling, “Let’s not mention that he has no flaws. So what if he has flaws? Wang Muyan has grasped the Thousand-Faced Demonic Technique; even a Quasi-Saint can’t see through her true appearance. The Saint Elders can only sense something is wrong with her, but the Wang Clan claims it’s because of her Innate Saint Heart and Lunar Yin Divine Physique. What can you do about it? All the Saint Elders were long alarmed by the Primal Demonic Eyes of that holy son within the Dao Yang Palace, but who dares to question it? Not to mention the Dragon Clan’s techniques of your Zhang Clan’s prince. Are they really loyal to the Heavenly Dao Sect?”

Zhang Yue’s face became even paler after hearing what the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign said, and he no longer dared to say a word.

“Also, that lass from the Bai Clan, the beloved disciple of the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. Her Innate Yang Saint Physique is filled with weirdness, and who knows where the Serene Dust Great Saint’s disciple who possesses the Primal Yin Saint Physique came from? How are you going to explain that? Don’t forget Sheng Ling’zi, who has been in seclusion for twenty years within the Holy Spirit Courtyard. Who dares to pursue it?”

After hearing that, Zhang Yue could feel a chill run down his spine because he had only heard rumors about this. He didn’t expect that even his master didn’t know more about them.

The Nether Orchid Saint Sovereign sighed, “Ever since three thousand years ago, when the old sect master was killed by the Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng, the Heavenly Dao Sect has been declining. We’re barely holding up, and we have only a rapport. Even if there’s an issue about Ye Qingtian, it’s a matter of the Ye Clan and the Dragon Origin Great Saint, and we’re not qualified to interfere.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
