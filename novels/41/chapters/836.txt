Chapter 837 - Flower Blooming in a Myriad Miles!

A powerful gale made the sky turn dark as Lin Yun executed the last part of the Dustlight Sword Art. In a split second, Yu Haotian was sent flying even after he pushed the Heavenly Earth Overlord Art to the limit. The unforeseeable scene left many people shocked.

“Yu Haotian was sent flying!”

“It seems like he was injured. How unbelievable…”

“Lin Yun’s attack definitely transcends the Violet Palace Realm. Even a Heavenly Soul Realm expert won’t be able to see through his attack. I don’t think a single genius that hasn’t reached the first soul can shrug off his spiritual sword intent. Even Yu Haotian isn’t an exception.” When Yu Haotian unleashed his cultivation in the Heavenly Soul Realm, no one thought that Lin Yun had the opportunity to win. They assumed that Lin Yun would get killed before he could admit defeat.

To the crowd, Yu Haotian was an unparalleled genius, so they weren’t sure Lin Yun would win even with the spiritual sword intent. After all, Yu Haotian’s existence was too discouraging. So, they were surprised that Yu Haotian’s injuries looked more serious. All Lin Yun had was a trace of blood on his lips.

Yu Haotian received three sinister-looking wounds from Lin Yun. He shouldn’t have been wounded since he cultivated the Indigomoon Sutra to a high level and had the Indigomoon Sacred Light to defend himself. Furthermore, he was empowered by his Heavenly Soul Realm’s aura.

However, he had actually received a terrible injury. How could the genius who didn’t even need to use half of his strength get injured so badly?

At this moment, a violent fluctuation spread out on the stage from Lin Yun and Yu Haotian’s attacks. The shockwave was so terrifying that even an ordinary Heavenly Soul Realm expert would be heavily injured if they were caught.

“This is too terrifying. Are they really youngsters?”

“This banquet is truly worthy of being known as the best ever. This battle will probably be unmatched in the future.”

“Both of them are creating history right now. Their strength is so abnormal, especially Lin Yun. Can you imagine how powerful he’ll become after reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm.” At this moment, the elders expressed their shock.

“Big Brother Yun…” Yue Weiwei couldn’t help becoming nervous when she looked at the blood dripping from Lin Yun’s lips. She was so engrossed in the fight that she didn’t even notice her emotions fluctuate.

Everyone from the Great Qin Empire was also shocked when they looked at Lin Yun. They could no longer comprehend what was going on. Every minute of the fight was torturous to them and it felt like their hearts were about to burst.

“Damn it. Why is that bastard so strong!” Qing Ruoyou’s eyes flashed venomously from the Indigomoon Elysium’s seats. The elders and disciples of the Indigomoon Elysium were also dumbfounded. They never thought that Yu Haotian would get injured.

“Spiritual sword intent...spiritual sword intent…” Yu Haotian looked at his injuries with a dark face and gritted his teeth. His flesh squirmed, but due to the sword intent lingering in his wounds, he couldn’t heal. The lingering sword intent was too strong to erase in a short amount of time. A demonic cultivation technique like the Indigomoon Elysium had a powerful regenerative ability, but it could only heal normal wounds in the blink of an eye.

Yu Haotian had underestimated the might of Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent. When he thought back to the previous exchanges, he realized how reckless he had been. Although he was able to hit Lin Yun, barely 30% of his attack landed, which was nothing to the Azure Dragon Battle Physique. On the other hand, he suffered three swords from Lin Yun.

“You won’t have any more opportunities.” Yu Haotian’s face was indifferent. He was determined not to give Lin Yun any opportunities.

Indigomoon Demonwalk!

Executing his movement technique, moonlight exploded around Yu Haotian. He reached Lin Yun in an instant and threw out a punch.

Lin Yun knew that his origin energy wasn’t as dense as Yu Haotian, so he couldn’t casually unleash many ultimate attacks. Without any hesitation, he executed the Seven Profound Steps and began to flash around on the stage to dodge Yu Haotian’s punches. Each one of Yu Haotian’s punches made the crowd feel like their hearts were about to explode.

Soon enough, a few spectators threw up blood and fainted from the shockwaves. Most of the spectators had pale faces at this moment, but none of them dared to miss out on the details of the fight. They could sense that they would benefit greatly by observing this fight. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

As Lin Yun recovered his origin energy, he started to counterattack. With his spiritual sword intent, his sword rays moved like a brush on an empty canvas.

Yu Haotian’s face was indifferent, but he was unprecedentedly cautious. He no longer had the same arrogance as before. All thoughts of suppressing and killing Lin Yun had gone out the window. At this moment, his only goal was to win.

“Get down!” Frustrated that he couldn’t find Lin Yun’s flaws, Yu Haotian’s eyes exploded with boundless killing aura. “Overlord Fist—Tearless Firmament!”

When he threw his punch, purple light exploded behind, causing the entire heaven and earth to blur. The entire world lost its colors for a moment as Yu Haotian’s purple punch was the only thing that shined.

“Not good!” Lin Yun felt threatened because Yu Haotian’s punch arrived in front of him in the blink of an eye. He quickly executed the Cloudsoaring Art and tapped his foot in the air three times. Releasing a fluctuation in the air, he instantly appeared 1,000 meters away.

However, even with the distance, Yu Haotian’s fist still chased after him. Without hesitation, Lin Yun turned around and stabbed his sword out. At this moment, he had combined his sword intent and azure dragon aura to form a majestic azure dragon. The dragon appeared behind Lin Yun with torrential sword rays in its eyes.

When the attacks collided, Lin Yun was sent flying. He broke through the previously repaired barrier and flew past the stage. The barrier was extremely powerful and was able to fix itself. This time, however, it took a second for the barrier to recover. Up to this point, no one had ever been blown off the stage like Lin Yun.

“Holy shit, the barrier was broken!”

“Just how powerful is Yu Haotian?” Everyone was dumbfounded as they looked at Lin Yun. Is Lin Yun going to lose? Although being blown off the stage didn’t equate to a loss, Yu Haotian still had too much power for Lin Yun.

In the next moment, blood flowed out of Yu Haotian’s wounds. Since he poured all of his strength in the last punch, his wounds became worse. Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent was too terrifying to Yu Haotian. It lingered in his wounds and prevented him from healing himself. With an aloof expression, Yu Haotian spoke, “I told you, I won’t give you any more opportunities.”

“You really think too much.” Lin Yun’s cold voice sounded out as he spun around in the air. Then, he stabbed his sword out, creating nine different phenomena. Lin Yun was combining all nine forms of the Dustlight Sword Art together.

When he swung his sword down, he destroyed the barrier. The shockwave reached Lin Yun, causing his clothes and hair to flutter in the violent wind. As the wind blew through his hair, the purple mark on his forehead revealed itself.
