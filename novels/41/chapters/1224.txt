Chapter 1225 - Fighting the Suspend King Palace

When the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party arrived in the plaza, the entire plaza was filled with people. Their arrival immediately made everyone look at Lin Yun. Although no one was optimistic for Lin Yun, they were still looking forward to his fight.

After all, everyone speculated that Lin Yun had only used 70-80% of his strength in his fight with the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. He won the battle easily and anyone could tell that he didn’t use much of his strength. So they were all curious to see the limits of his strength.

The bustling plaza made everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect nervous. But they were a little confident because they benefited a lot from Lin Yun’s lesson. In fact, his lesson would save them at least ten years of effort. Not only did Lin Yun share with them the comprehension of sky sword intent, but also divine firmament sword intent.

Then again, he also gave them a clear warning not to attempt the divine firmament sword intent if they didn’t reach a certain level.

In just one night’s time, they had undergone a drastic transformation and they would definitely be depressed if they couldn’t defeat the Suspend King Palace after making so much improvement.

“It’s time to start drawing lots.” When Liu Qingyan swept his glance over, the Profound Azure Prefecture had already walked over to the Suspend King Palace waiting for them to draw lots. Only one side needed to draw lots. Since the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was the one who drew previously, it was naturally the Suspend King Palace’s turn this time. Then again, it didn’t matter which side drew the lots.

“Don’t be nervous,” said Lin Yun. Although he told everyone not to be nervous, they couldn’t help turning to look at the Suspend King Palace’s party in anticipation.

Lin Yun, on the other hand, wasn’t feeling nervous. As long as they were strong enough, they could just sweep through their opponents. Lin Yun of all people couldn’t rely on luck for every single thing that he did. Only through strength would he have confidence.

“Lin Yun!” Lin Yun suddenly heard his name being called. When he swept his glance out, he could see the surprised looks coming from the Suspend King Palace. Someone had picked the token with Lin Yun’s name on it and the Suspend King Palace was briefly stunned before they rejoiced.

“Hahaha! Senior Brother Qin, Senior Brother Chu, I picked Lin Yun!”

“Haha, not bad. You’re really lucky!”

“Hahaha, there’s nothing the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect can do now. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect is probably half-crippled now!”

“If Senior Brother Chu picks Ye Ziling, we’ll be able to crush the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.” The Suspend King Palace’s party was so excited that even Chu Tianhao wore a smile on his face. It was the best matchup they could get.

The matchup made the audience feel disappointed because they wouldn’t be able to see Lin Yun’s true strength. They already knew that Feng Kui would definitely lose to Lin Yun, so there was no suspense to the fights anymore. The crowd was really hoping to see Chu Tianhao match with Lin Yun. However, that would have put the Suspend King Palace in a huge disadvantage, so it was no wonder why they were so happy right now.

“Senior Brother, it’s your turn. If you manage to pick Ye Ziling, we’ll be able to crush them four to one!” Qin Yang smiled. His words also drew everyone’s attention because Ye Ziling was the only other person from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect that could cause them trouble.

After all, Ye Ziling could be considered a genius among the younger generation. Aside from Lin Yun and Ye Zeling, the rest were practically garbage, especially their chief disciple Jiang Lichen.

Chu Tianhao casually picked a token and flipped it. But when the token was flipped, light condensed into Ye Ziling’s name, which made everyone even more excited.

“Hahaha!”

“Luck is on our side! Senior Brother really picked Ye Ziling!”

“That’s great!” They had to admit that this was the perfect matchup for them. Chu Tianhao was also surprised as he could become stronger through this battle to give him better odds of beating Xiahou Jue.

Very quickly, the entire matchup was determined. Feng Zhang would be facing Qin Yang, Jiang Lichen would face Han Yu, and Liu Qingyan would face Zhang Tianqiong. This wasn’t a beneficial matchup for the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, especially since Feng Zhang had to face Qin Yang who wasn’t any weaker than Ye Ziling. If anyone analyzed these matchups, they would conclude that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect would lose terribly.

When Lin Yun raised his head to look at the Suspend King Palace, Qin Yang was looking over with a mocking smile.

“First battle of the second round, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect against the Suspend King Palace!” Along with the Profound Azure Prefecture’s words, ten figures flew out and landed on their respective stages.

“I heard that you’re the chief disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?” Han Yu looked at Jiang Lichen with a mocking smile.

But Jiang Lichen had maintained his composure, ignoring Han Yu’s provocation.

“You’re not going to reply? Do you really treat yourself as a chief disciple? You’re nothing compared to Senior Brother Chu, and I’ll show you by defeating you in ten moves!” Han Yu smiled and retrieved a spear before stabbing it into the ground. When the spear sank into the ground, it made the entire stage tremble as Han Yu released his monarch aura.

Han Yu held onto his spear and looked at Jiang Lichen coldly. Although he was mocking Jiang Lichen, he didn’t dare to be careless because they were about to fight. When Jiang Lichen held onto his sword, he immediately charged out with his monarch aura soaring into the sky and his spear stabbing forward.

It was a terrifying attack, not to mention that it was empowered by his monarch aura. Even from such a distance, everyone could feel the suppression coming from the monarch aura.

But Jiang Lichen was surprised because he couldn’t sense any pressure coming from the monarch aura. On the other hand, he had a feeling that he could easily suppress his opponent if he used his sword intent.

Jiang Lichen was feeling baffled and he wondered if Han Yu had revealed his weakness on purpose. After all, he had a deep impression of the Suspend King Palace’s performance yesterday.

“You dare to be distracted in our fight?” Han Yu smiled. But just when his spear was about to stab Jiang Lichen, the latter easily blocked his attack and took several steps back to avoid the next attack.

By the time Jiang Lichen recovered from his own thoughts, Han Yu held the initiative in the fight. But the more they fought, the more confident Jiang Lichen became. He finally knew that his opponent wasn’t showing weakness on purpose but that Han Yu’s monarch aura was nothing compared to Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Aura.

Lin Yun also directed his gaze over because he was worried about Jiang Lichen the most as yesterday’s loss dealt a great blow to his confidence. Even with what happened last night, Lin Yun wasn’t certain if Jiang Lichen could win. But now that he looked at it, he didn’t have to worry about their battle anymore because Jiang Lichen hadn’t brought out his full strength. If he did, he would be able to easily suppress Han Yu.

When everyone started their fight, only Ye Ziling and Chu Tianhao were left. Seeing this, Lin Yun shifted his attention away. Ye Ziling and Chu Tianhao were both the leading disciples of their own sects, and he wasn’t even sure if Ye Ziling could win. Then again, last night had greatly improved Ye Ziling’s strength because she was already in the greater sky sword intent. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Even if she wanted to take the next step, it wasn’t something that could be accomplished in one night. In the end, she could only rely on herself in the fight. If she couldn’t even defeat Chu Tianhao, then her obsession was nothing.

“There’s nothing to look at. Aside from you, no one from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect can win,” Feng Kui smiled when he saw Lin Yun looking at the other stages. Looking at Lin Yun, he continued, “I bet it must feel bad knowing that there’s nothing you can do despite your strength.

“The Suspend King Palace will win? Don’t be so sure about that…” Lin Yun smiled in response.

Hearing that, Feng Kui raised his brow and smiled, “Isn’t it obvious? Aside from you, only Ye Ziling can be considered an expert. But it’s a pity that she ran into Senior Brother Chu. As for the rest, they’re just garbage, not to mention that your chief disciple lost to a nobody from the Heavenly Astral Pavilion!”

“Take a look again before you speak,” said Lin Yun coldly.

Lin Yun’s words baffled Feng Kui. But when he turned his attention to the other stages, his face changed drastically. Han Yu and the others initially had the advantage, but they were now in dire straits. Their monarch aura couldn’t do a single thing to their opponents. Looking at this scene, Feng Kui was so dumbfounded that his jaw nearly touched the floor.
