Chapter 1749 – First on the Nirvana Banquet

Lin Yun had already disappeared when Li Yuxi raised his head. When Lin Yun reappeared, a majestic sun appeared before him, and he swung the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute down like a sword.

When he released his Firmament Sword Intent, dazzling golden radiance shone on him, making him look like he was forged with gold, unleashing a torrential pressure that swept out.

As Lin Yun let out a roar, his sword ocean began to rumble, and the golden human above the sword ocean also formed a seal, executing the Divine Azure Annihilation. The azure dragon that was hidden within the sword ocean breach the ocean’s surface. This was one of Lin Yun’s two sword souls. The azure dragon looked vivid and was going berserk, unwilling to be controlled.

But the golden human was like a deity, and its golden radiance was even stronger than the Azure Dragon Sword Soul. When the azure dragon was empowered by sword intent, a small hand reached out, and the azure dragon was placed under significant restriction.

When the azure dragon flew from Lin Yun’s brows, a thunderstorm swept out, and the sword ray Li Yuxi gave off was instantly crushed. The surrounding space immediately became restricted, isolated from the outside world. This naturally placed Li Yuxi in great fear because he discovered he couldn’t break free from the restriction of Lin Yun’s sword intent.

Everyone around the Nirvana Stage was shocked. Lin Yun also used the Firmament Sword Intent, but he was several times stronger than Li Yuxi. It was like Qin Hao was nothing before Li Yuxi, despite being at the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. That was the same for Li Yuxi, who was insignificant before Lin Yun.

Taking a step forth, Lin Yun’s hair and robe fluttered in the wind. This made him look aloof, and the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute was thrust into Qin Hao’s body, creating a massive hole in the latter’s chest.

As blood splashed, Li Yuxi let loose a painful scream before falling onto his knee, clutching his chest. He lost his grip on the sword under the pain, allowing his sword to fall to the ground. When Li Yuxi raised his head, his pupils were filled with reluctance.

Lin Yun looked down at Li Yuxi from high above before waving his hand, summoning the Skyhook to his hand.

“My sword…” Li Yuxi wanted to reach out for it, but he ultimately pulled his hand back with bitterness on his face. He could not say anything about it because he lost the battle, and he had to acknowledge the bet about giving it to Lin Yun.

But when Lin Yun held onto Skyhook, he didn’t even look at it. He held the sword hilt with his right hand and the tip with his left before bending it. Just like that, the priceless myriad runes saint sword shattered into pieces.

“No!” Li Yuxi was stunned before his eyes bulged out. This was because Lin Yun destroyed his sword, which was even more humiliating than having Skyhook seized by Lin Yun.

“Since you want a fight, I’ll fulfill your wish, then. But this so-called ‘Skyhook Sword’ is nothing in my eyes. I just want to tell you that you’re not worthy of letting Yue Weiwei dance for you nor clashing swords with me.” Lin Yun said indifferently.

The surroundings fell silent, and everyone was dumbfounded by what Lin Yun said. Lin Yun was in the limelight at this moment. He had taken up ninety percent of the attention on the Nirvana Banquet, and the remaining ten percent was split between everyone.

“Get the strongest of your Ming Cult to come. Li Yuxi… you’re too weak. I don’t need your kowtow; I just need you to stay in the Ming Cult for the next century to reflect on yourself.” Lin Yun left with the Thunderstorm Zither when he was done, leaving Li Yuxi dazed.

Down the stage, Zhang Ying and Chen Jun gulped down a mouthful of saliva and rejoiced. It might be embarrassing that Lin Yun defeated them, but they weren’t as humiliated as Li Yuxi.

“Bring him down.” The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master waved his hand, and several elders brought Li Yuxi away. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Is anyone willing to challenge him?” The pavilion master looked around and asked. “Does anyone still want to fight Lin Xiao?”

No one said a word when they heard that, and they turned to look at Yan Tianchen. In the final battle between the twenty, Yue Weiwei defeated seven while Lin Yun defeated four. This meant that only Yan Tianchen was the strongest amongst everyone who hadn’t fought.

But Yan Tianchen shook his head. He naturally didn’t want to fight Lin Yun. Not only was he unsure if he could win, but they were both representing the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. So there was no meaning in competing for the first.

Yan Tianchen swept through the remaining people as expected as the battles continued. The battles were pretty exciting because of Yan Tianchen’s achievement in music dao. But for some reason, everyone felt bored after witnessing the fight between Lin Yun and Li Yuxi. No matter how breathtaking they were, these battles lacked luster when compared to their fight.

With that, the Nirvana Banquet was finally concluded, and the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master announced the rankings.

“Third on the Nirvana Banquet, Yue Weiwei.” Yue Weiwei’s performance at the banquet was stunning. Although she lost to Qin Hao after seven consecutive wins, the pavilion master felt that Yue Weiwei was stronger than Qin Hao if she had fought him in her best condition.

“Second on the Nirvana Banquet, Yan Tianchen!” The pavilion master smiled, and he turned to Yan Tianchen. “I believe your attainment in music dao might not be inferior to Lin Xiao, and you held back in your battles. Are you sure you’re not going to fight him? If you’re willing, I can make an exception for you. In terms of music dao alone, you still stand a pretty high chance.”

His words caused an uproar because no one expected that the pavilion master would hold such a high opinion of Yan Tianchen, and he was even willing to give the latter an exception when the third round ended.

“No need. Junior Brother Lin only practiced music dao for two years, which proves nothing even if I win.” Yan Tianchen was pretty optimistic about it, and he smiled, “Furthermore, since the pavilion master feels that I’ve not given it my all, how do you know Lin Xiao hasn’t given it his all either?”

“Oh?” The pavilion master was surprised to hear Lin Yun hadn’t given his all in his fight.

Yan Tianchen merely responded with a smile. Others might not know, but he knew that Lin Xiao didn’t use his full strength in his fight.

“First on the Nirvana Banquet, Lin Xiao!” The pavilion master announced after a brief pause. The surroundings fell into a brief silence before everyone turned to look at Lin Yun, with the latter becoming the center of attention. The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion turned the tables on this Nirvana Banquet, occupying the top three.

Yue Weiwei smiled, looking at Lin Yun. Ever since he was forced to leave the Ancient Barren Domain, his heart had been filled with rage, and no one could understand how he felt. Others only knew that Flower Burial was a peerless genius in the sword, but they couldn’t understand the pain and sorrow he had to bear when he was forced to disguise himself.

When the Radiant Sword Saint descended outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield and saved Lin Yun, this further shortened his lifespan; he did not have much left. This was Tian Xuanzi’s scheme, and this was also the pain in Lin Yun’s heart. Thus, Yue Weiwei hoped that first on the Nirvana Banquet could comfort Lin Yun.

Very quickly, the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples came forth for their rewards. There were five hundred Profound Saint Pellets. Aside from that, they could also pick ancient scores and musical instruments from the Heavenly Nirvana Treasury.

Then again, the Three-Lives Fruit was the center of attention. There was a legend that one would be brought into the Three-Lives Realm by devouring it, and the flow of time within it differed from the outside world. Spending a year in that realm was only an incense’s time in the outside world.

If one had enough opportunities, they could even stay there for ten years. This was a treasure that even holy land geniuses were attracted to. The various holy lands had similar time-space treasures, but the price to activate them was high. So even in the holy lands, few people were qualified to use the treasures. Not to mention that one didn’t have to pay any price for using the Three-Lives Fruit, which was enough to show its value.

When the rewards were distributed, the pavilion master smiled, “Tomorrow, those in the top ten will have a chance to play a song before the Three-Lives Tree. If you’re lucky enough, you might be able to obtain a Three-Lives Fruit. Even if you’re not lucky, you can improve your music dao before the Three-Lives Tree.”

Everyone was excited when they heard that, but they soon calmed down. It had been centuries since flowers bloomed on the Three-Lives Tree. So it was practically impossible to make it bear fruit. But what the pavilion master said was right. Even if they couldn’t obtain the Three-Lives Fruit and Three-Lives Flower, they would still benefit from it.

“Pavilion master, I have something to say.” Lin Yun suddenly said, instantly attracting everyone’s attention. Everyone was curious about what Lin Yun was going to say.
