Chapter 2445 - Twin Stars

Lin Yun’s voice echoed as his sword intent boiled, faintly showing signs of reaching the legendary ninth-grade sword intent. Donned in his azure robe and carrying a sword box behind him, Lin Yun hovered in the air, looking like a bright moon in the sky, illuminating all the peaks in the Sword Sect.

The phenomena of a myth belonging to him began to appear in the surroundings with heavenly music pleasing to the ears. All the Great Saints present turned to look in his direction, and the Great Saints from the Profound Sky Sect’s faction retreated with their faces changed.

They were surprised to discover they suffered a huge loss in their faction. Almost all of their Great Saints were injured, and even Great Saints who reached the Immortal Stage had greatly exhausted their origin.

On the contrary, not many from the Sword Sect’s faction were injured, which was weird. In reality, no one noticed that when the battle began, a woman was playing a flute on a mountain beyond Scarlet Firmament Peak, playing the Divine Dragon Tune.

When the music landed on the Great Saints belonging to the Sword Sect’s faction, there wasn’t any phenomenon but they felt that their martial techniques became smooth in their hands. They didn’t discover that they were much stronger than usual under the empowerment of the music.

But when they stopped fighting, the flute music also stopped, disappearing in the cloud of dust.

“What’s going on? Why couldn't the Primordial God Purging Array suppress them?”

“Even if Netherport is injured, the array should easily be able to suppress Great Saints, but they’re not injured?!” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint looked around and observed that they suffered huge casualties on their side, while the Sword Sect’s Great Saints merely suffered light injuries.

Lin Yun descended with the sword box on his back, his sword ray swept out like moonlight. When he landed on the ground, the Light Subduing Great Saint soared to the sky, appearing before Lin Yun in the next moment and unleashed a palm. That was a forbidden technique of the Ming Cult, the Sun-Moon Demonic Hand!

But Lin Yun had no change on his face. He wasn’t afraid of the Light Subduing Great Saint without the sword box and now he carried it on his back. His sword clashed with the Light Subduing Great Saint’s palm and his sword aura soared, blocking the descending giant black palm.

“A mere mortal dares fight the Flower Burial Sword?” A cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes as he let go of the sword before slamming at the hilt of the Flower Burial Sword with his palm. The seven glory spirits of the Flower Burial Sword were unleashed, releasing the glory of the sword that once belonged to the Southern Emperor.

The sword pierced through the Light Subduing Great Saint’s palm. When Lin Yun held onto the sword again, he rotated with the sword, causing the Light Subduing Great Saint’s right hand to explode. The forbidden technique crumbled while the Light Subduing Great Saint was sent flying. The other Great Saints feared that the Light Subduing Great Saint would crash into them and quickly retreated.

For a moment, the morale of the Sword Sect rose with everyone cheering.

“Light Subduing, haven’t you learned any lesson after resorting to sneak attacks multiple times?” Jian Jingtian sneered with disdain.

The Light Subduing Great Saint screamed and threw out a mouthful of blood. Even with his undying physique, he couldn’t grow a new arm back because the sword intent lingering in his wounds left him in immense pain, constantly stopping the vitality from growing his arm back.

On the other hand, the Heavenly Glory and Dark Sorrow Great Saints struggled back on their feet with pale faces. Anyone could tell they were circulating saint dao to suppress the Bright Sun Sword Intent within their bodies.

The Heavenly Sever Great Saint’s face became ugly, knowing they had lost. When he raised his head, he saw his brothers looking at him as well, and they shared the same thought: to leave.

“If you all leave now, we can discuss our feud. Otherwise, only one party will live,” Mu Xuankong said, representing the entire Sword Sect as the sect master. The Sword Sect might hold the advantage, but both parties were Great Saints, and it was hard for them to end the fight if they carried on fighting. The longer they dragged the fight, the more uncertainties there were.

Jian Jingtian said, “If you all leave now, I won’t come after you all within a hundred years, and I won’t go after your descendants or disciples.”

The other Great Saints stepped forward as he spoke, and their aura suppressed the opposite party entirely.

“Hahaha! Jian Jingtian, it has been so many years, and your temper hasn’t changed. Didn’t the Radiant Sword Saint tell you that if you commit too many massacres as a swordsman, it won’t be easy for you to become an Emperor?” A burst of laughter resounded as a meteor descended from the sky. When the light dissipated, a person with long golden hair, white clothes, and a flower on his right shoulder appeared. He looked beautiful for a man. He was naturally Tian Xuanzi!

Everyone’s faces changed upon seeing him. The faces of those from the Sword Sect’s faction sank with worry in their eyes. Since Tian Xuanzi was here, did that mean his battle with the Divine Phoenix Holy Master had ended? But where was the Divine Phoenix Holy Master?

“We pay our greetings!” The Great Saints from the Profound Sky Sect’s faction rejoiced and bowed.

Tian Xuanzi smiled as he patted the Light Subduing Great Saint, expelling the Bright Sun Sword Intent left within his body, allowing the Light Subduing Great Saint’s arm to swiftly grow back. He also gave two flicks on Heavenly Glory and Dark Sorrow Great Saints, helping them dispel the sword intent lingering within their bodies.

The Light Subduing Great Saint quickly expressed gratitude and returned the Imperial Dragon Order.

Right then, another streak descended from the sky. It was the Divine Phoenix Holy Master, but he was covered in injuries. With one glance, anyone could tell who won the fight.

“Holy Master!” Ye Guhan and everyone stepped forward to check on the Divine Phoenix Holy Master.

“Sorry about that. I failed to stop him.” The Divine Phoenix Holy Master smiled bitterly with guilt on his face.

Lin Yun stepped forward to hold onto the Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s right arm, pouring the blue dragon aura into the latter’s body. But the Divine Phoenix Holy Master quickly stopped him and said, “I’m fine. But my dao origin is damaged.”

Upon hearing that, Lin Yun took a deep breath, knowing it was troublesome.

“Profound Sky Great Saint, invincible in Ancient Barren!”

““Profound Sky Great Saint, invincible in Ancient Barren!””

Just when everyone from the Sword Sect’s faction wore a grave expression, the morale of those from the Profound Sky Sect rose as they cheered.

Tian Xuanzi smiled and leaned backward as the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne flew over, catching him. The white cat jumped at him when Tian Xuanzi spread his hands out. Sweeping his gaze out, he noticed the smear of frightening sword rays in the depths of the Sword Sect. The sword rays gave off a powerful and destructive aura.

That place was forbidden; anyone inside would die unless they reached the Emperor Realm. On the other hand, the Sword Sect was heavily damaged, and the saint vein was more or less destroyed. This meant that the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation would be more or less affected.

But the main peak was still around, enough for the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation.

“I’m not someone who likes killing. Back down and let me observe the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation.” The Golden-Purple Dragon Throne hovered in the air as Tian Xuanzi looked at everyone from the Sword Sect’s faction, wearing a gentle smile. Judging by his appearance and smile, it was hard for anyone to link him with someone vicious.

“This is the Sword Sect, and you should be the one leaving!” Jian Jingtian roared and charged over, unleashing his Bright Sun Sword Intent.

Lin Yun also wanted to step forward, but Ye Guhan stopped him. When they looked at each other, Ye Guhan smiled, “Senior Brother is around.”

Lin Yun bit his lips, but he felt a warmth in his heart that made his eyes watery. He never felt the world was unfair like the Light Subduing Great Saint. He knew that he suffered a lot, but he also knew that many people felt heartache for him.

His master doted on him, the two mistresses doted on him, and his senior brothers also doted on him. Su Ziyao might not have said anything, but her hand held onto his tightly.

“Let him come.” Tian Xuanzi said, stopping anyone from intercepting Jian Jingtian. With a flick of his finger, the throne he sat on let out a vibration as a sword flew out. The sword manifested into a White Dragon, blocking Jian Jingtian’s incoming attack.

But in the next moment, Dragon Origin, Heavenly Jade, Serene Dust, Ye Guhan, the Demon Clan’s Great Saint, and Mister Ghost made a move to gang up on Tian Xuanzi. They were all talented Great Saints and were stronger than ordinary Great Saints. They could easily fight two in the same cultivation as them, and someone like Ye Guhan could face three.

The entire Scarlet Firmament Peak began to tremble when so many Great Saints joined hands. But facing them, Tian Xuanzi caressed the cat with his left hand and formed seals with his right. With a vibrating noise, six swords flew out from the throne behind him, each manifesting into a divine dragon that forced the incoming Great Saints back.

A dragon’s roar echoed on the stage, with sword rays rippling. The seven dragon clan’s swords easily blocked the incoming Great Saints, and the Great Saints could barely put up a fight. Throughout the entire process, Tian Xuanzi sat on the throne and didn’t make a move. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Profound Sky Great Saint, invincible in Ancient Barren!”

The cultivators outside the Sword Sect were shocked when they saw this scene.

“If an Emperor doesn’t show up, who can fight him...” Many Saints who saw this scene were shocked by Tian Xuanzi’s strength.

Ye Guhan knocked the Golden Dragon Sword away and looked at Tian Xuanzi with a decisive light flashing in his eyes.

Tian Xuanzi’s face was complicated as he looked at Ye Guhan. Back then, they were known as Twin Stars, who became famous. They were good friends, but they came to the point where they had to draw swords against each other.

I seemed to have walked on the wrong path... Tian Xuanzi smiled bitterly as he reached out to grab the Golden Dragon Sword with a smear of sorrow on his face.

“Tian Xuanzi, I’ve said before that I’ll kill you if you dare come to the Sword Sect!” Ye Guhan pointed his sword at Tian Xuanzi.
