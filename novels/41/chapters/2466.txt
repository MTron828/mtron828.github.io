Chapter 2467 - Everyone Toasts Me, I Toast Everyone

When the Flower Burial Sword and Heavenly Que Sword clashed, it looked like the collision of two suns. The two swords also gave off a powerful sword intent that soon filled and enveloped the plaza.

Dao Suspend Sword Saint and Lin Yun raised their heads and were surprised. The Dao Suspend Sword Saint was surprised that the Flower Burial Sword would be so powerful that even the Skysolute City’s Sovereign Saint Sword couldn’t do anything to it, which also brought a hint of concern in his eyes.

On the other hand, Lin Yun wore a confident smile because this was his rapport with the Flower Burial Sword after so many years. He believed that the Flower Burial Sword could win, and it was the strongest.

They formed seals as they recollected their gazes, and a painting appeared behind them. One was the Heaven Burial Constellation, while the other was a majestic city, and this was also a Sovereign Constellation.

Their sword aura and Sovereign Saint Swords collided, producing an earth-shattering sound. As they clashed, the aura coming from the two Sovereign Saint Swords grew increasingly more terrifying. With a rumble, the two swords clashed together as the Dao Suspend Sword Saint formed a seal with his right and left hand supporting his wrist, trying to push his sword forward. Under his pressure, his invisible sword aura formed into a golden wing shape under Lin Yun’s Yin-Yang Sword Art.

Even so, his sword aura couldn’t suppress Lin Yun, and his sword aura was crumbling under the Yin-Yang Sword Domain.

Dao Suspend Sword Saint finally couldn’t hold on any longer, and he said, “Flower Burial, let us determine a victor with our fists!”

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint was naturally unhappy that he was forced to draw the sword first in their previous fight. Before Lin Yun could reply, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint charged forward, unleashing full powers with Great Solar Flames blazing on his palms.

Unwilling to admit his defeat? Lin Yun smiled because he also wasn’t happy either. He wouldn’t have kept taking a one-sided beating from the Dao Suspend Sword Saint if he hadn't tried to refine the Heavenly Dragon Bone's remnant energies. Since the Dao Suspend Sword Saint wanted to compete with their bare hands, he was naturally willing to clash again!

When Lin Yun let out a roar, he could feel his blood boiling, unleashing the full power of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique. Golden radiance shone in his eyes, making his eyes seem like a pair of dragon eyes. Under his gaze, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint felt tremendous pressure.

This wasn’t the suppression from the cultivation, but from the bloodline, making Dao Suspend Sword Saint feel like a Heavenly Dragon was looking at him. This made the Dao Suspend Sword Saint’s face change with a hint of fear in his eyes.

But Lin Yun didn’t care and stomped his foot on the ground before charging over. Throwing out a punch, it felt like a clenched dragon’s claw, releasing the authority of Heavenly Dragon. Beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven, the constellation was also attracted by his power as a massive dragon’s claw tore through the sky and descended.

The fist enveloped in the Great Solar Flame was shattered by an explosion. When the Dao Suspend Sword Saint took several steps back to stabilize himself, his eyes were filled with shock.

“Senior, since you want to fight with bare hands, I won’t hold back any longer!” Lin Yun raised his head, accompanied by a dragon’s roar, and a dragon’s head was faintly visible behind him. Before the Dao Suspend Sword Saint could react, Lin Yun let out a roar, and the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique was fully unleashed.

Enveloped in golden radiance, a heavenly dragon coiled around him with the dragon’s head resting on his shoulder, letting out a roar with Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun threw a punch out, the Heavenly Dragon coiled around his hand, flying out along with his punch.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint crossed his arms together to block the incoming attack, and the impact made his internal rumble. When the two clashed, the Heavenly Dragon fused into the Sovereign Dragon Fist after ten-odd moves later, and he pushed his hands forward.

This time, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint was pushed back while Lin Yun soared to the sky and roared, “Azure Dragon!”

The Azure Dragon Constellation, controlled by the Heavenly Dragon’s authority, manifested beneath Lin Yun's feet, and let out a powerful aura.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint withstood this power with great difficulty, but he couldn’t withstand it and took ten steps back, throwing a mouthful of blood. As for the two swords clashing in the sky, the Heavenly Que Sword was knocked down by the Flower Burial Sword and plunged into the ground.

This scene left everyone shocked. The first round was between their daos, in which Lin Yun held the advantage. Then, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint lost in a bare-hand fight. Last but not least, the Flower Burial Sword defeated the Heavenly Que Sword, and the Dao Suspend Sword Saint lost in a bare-hand fight again.

“The Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique, powerful as rumored.” The Dao Suspend Sword Saint took in a deep breath. He could only cup his fists to admit defeat even if he wasn't willing.

Lin Yun cupped his fists and said, “This is only a spar, and there’s no win or loss. If we were to engage in a life-and-death battle, the outcome is unpredictable.”

Those were only polite words because if they were to engage in a life-and-death battle, Lin Yun had a record of killing Tian Xuanzi, even if he used an external item. But Lin Yun didn’t push it and gave the Dao Suspend Sword Saint face.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint’s face improved, and he smiled, “Well, this is only an exchange in our swords. No matter how you looked at it, you won in this bare-hand fight.

The atmosphere instantly eased after the Dao Suspend Sword Saint said that.

“Hahaha! Flower Burial has a great breadth of mind. Since that’s the case, I would also like to fight you.” Many sect masters were eager to go up after seeing Lin Yun winning the Dao Suspend Sword Saint.

The Black Plume Palace’s sect master, the Heavenly Plume Sword Saint, stood up to look at Lin Yun with fighting spirits blazing in his eyes.

“Come!” Lin Yun smiled and grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword.

The Thousand Plume Sword Saint also came with the sect’s Sovereign Saint Sword, and they fought with their swords. The Thousand Plume Sword Saint used Kunpeng Sword Art. This sword technique has two intents: the carefree and abyssal water.

On the other hand, Lin Yun fought with the Divine Phoenix Sword, using the phoenix to face kunpeng.

Initially, the Thousand Plume Sword Saint gained a slight advantage, but he soon looked exhausted. Meanwhile, Lin Yun looked like he was dancing, and his sword technique contained indescribable beauty. The power even reached the level that it could easily slay a Great Saint, but when Lin Yun performed it, it felt like he was lifting something light.

Everyone was fascinated by Lin Yun’s sword as they watched, immersed in it.

“This sword technique is breathtaking! It’s beyond the deification stage!”

“This is weird. There’s a rhythm in his sword technique like music.” All the sword saints were amazed by Lin Yun’s sword technique. When they came to their senses, they realized that Lin Yun’s sword technique was stronger than his fist technique.

“Thousand Plume Sword Saint, let me help you!” Just when the Thousand Plume Sword Saint was about to be defeated, the head monk of the Heavenly Dragon Monastery joined the fight. He was called the Profound Dragon Sword Saint, and his sword was accompanied by Buddhist music and Buddhist rays, the Heavenly Dragon Sword.

The Heavenly Dragon Monastery’s Heavenly Dragon Sword was similar to Lin Yun’s version, but they were also different.

“Great!” Lin Yun laughed as he executed the Heavenly Dragon Sword and Divine Phoenix Sword, fusing to form the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Art. Furthermore, Lin Yun also incorporated the Yin-Yang Sword Domain into the sword technique as the dragon and phoenix manifested into heaven and earth with sword rays intertwining.

Space became chaotic with the Profound Dragon and Thousand Plume Sword Saints’ foreheads covered in sweat.

“Bravo! Let me join in!” The Frostsnow Sacred Palace’s sect master rejoiced with excitement in his eyes. He didn’t expect that the Profound Dragon and Thousand Plume Sword Saints couldn’t force out Lin Yun’s limit and even show everyone an exquisite sword technique.

“Hahaha! Let me join the fight as well!” The Myriad Sword Pavilion’s sect master also joined in excitedly. Everyone could see that even if the Profound Dragon and Thousand Plume Sword Saints were suppressed, their attainment in the sword was rapidly improving under the fight.

It had been many years since any of the sect masters fought, and they have long reached a bottleneck. Now that they saw Lin Yun’s breathtaking sword technique, they all became excited as though they had become youths once again.

“Hidden Sword Manor’s Spiritual Seal Sword Saint is here to seek an exchange with Flower Burial!”

“Abyssal Flame Sword Saint, here to seek an exchange with Flower Burial!” The sect masters and patriarchs of the top ten forces joined the fray aside from Dao Suspend Sword Saint, leaving everyone stumped.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint also couldn’t hold back, and he smiled, “Since everyone else from the top ten holy lands joined in, how can I be exempted?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It was a pity that he couldn’t clash with Lin Yun in the sword earlier. He didn’t stand out because he already fought once, but he couldn’t hold back after seeing all the sect masters going up.

“Sect master!” The Skysolute Sect’s swordsmen were dumbfounded. Was this still an exchange in the sword? Not to mention that their sect master had lost once, and they couldn’t understand why Dao Suspend Sword Saint wanted to join in, disregarding the rules.

“What’s so special about Lin Yun?” Chu Liang asked in an indignant tone.

Jian Jue said with a grave expression, “Have you discovered that Lin Yun’s sword technique is close to immortal? His attainment in the sword has surpassed the limit of Kunlun Realm...I even saw master’s shadows in him, but it was entirely different at the same time. His sword is sharper than master’s. If we have to make a comparison, he felt like those immortals from ancient times. So, who wouldn’t want to fight an immortal?”

Chu Ling was stumped as he looked at Lin Yun, enveloped in a layer of moonlight as he carried the Iris Sword Box. Even when facing the top ten sword saints, Lin Yun still wore a calm smile with fighting spirits in the depths of his eyes, and he was instantly infected by it. That was a pure heart that sought dao.

Lin Yun’s interest rose suddenly, and he suddenly comprehended the Divine Firefly Sword he had forgotten. He smiled, “I came to seek dao, clouds in the blue sky, and water in the bottle. Sometimes, straight up to the top of the solitary peak, under the moon, howl with the clouds in a single sound."

Letting out a roar, the Flower Burial Sword released an unprecedented radiance that the ten sword saints didn’t dare to look at straight. When he moved, the myth belonging to Lin Yun appeared once more as saint music and sword music overlapped.

“I’m the moon in the clouds and an immortal!” Lin Yun swung his sword out, unleashing a dazzling sword ray resembling a firefly hovering above the Skysolute City. The power of this attack forced the ten sword saints to retreat with shock on their faces.

When Lin Yun descended from the sky, he raised the Flower Burial Sword before him. Just when the ten sword saints stabilized themselves, Lin Yun swiped his fingers on his sword. Before everyone could come to their senses, Lin Yun raised his head and smiled, “Three thousand Greater Daos, but only the Sword is supreme!”

As he swiped his fingers on the sword, a droplet of blood fell onto the sword. The sky instantly turned dark, and only Yu Qingfeng and the Radiant Sword Emperor could see what was going on as Lin Yun’s sword intent had blocked the light in Skysolute City.

When everyone was baffled, a crimson radiance shone through the darkness, enveloping Lin Yun. In the next second, a dazzling sword ray bloomed as Lin Yun kept the Nirvana Daos and other daos, only releasing the Sword Dao.

His Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent manifested into crimson petals flying from him, and his sword intent began to rise. Facing the sword intent he gave off, the ten sword saints raised their swords before them, but they were still forced to retreat under the boundless sword intent.

“How is this possible?!”

“How is his sword intent so powerful?”

“His Sword Dao is even stronger than our Eternal Dao!” The faces of the ten sword saints became pale with confusion because Lin Yun’s sword intent wasn’t only strong but was boundless.

Ultimately, the ten sword saints were pushed out of the stage. The crimson petals hovering on the stage exploded, looking beautiful. This made some people curious and wanted to try touching it, but they were sent flying away in the next second.

This shocked everyone as Lin Yun cupped his fists at the ten sword saints. He smiled, “Thank you for the match.”

The Heavenly Plume Sword Saint sighed and looked at the other sword saints. He smiled bitterly, “We lost. Your attainment in the sword is reaching the level of ancient immortals.”

Looking at the crimson petals, the Profound Dragon Sword Saint said, “I’m Flower Burial, burying people and flowers alike. Your title matches you well.”

The other sword saints could feel how powerful Lin Yun’s attainment in the sword was after fighting him. It wasn’t terrifying but breathtaking, giving them countless enlightenment.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint said, “Flower Burial, these flowers are manifested with Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent, and it’s easy for others to be hurt by it...”

“My bad, my bad. I’ll give all the swordsmen in the world a toast!” Lin Yun smiled. He waved his hand to bring a cup of wine over before gulping it down. He laughed, “Drinking beneath the moon with everyone toasting to me, and I toasting to everyone!”
