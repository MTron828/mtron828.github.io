Chapter 1993 - Pursuit

Lin Yun, who suddenly spoke, naturally attracted the attention of the Third Master Lei’s group. The purple-clothed middle-aged man stood out and looked at Lin Yun in disdain, “Who the hell are you to poke your nose in the affairs of my Thunder Eagle Stronghold?”

In his view, Lin Yun was nothing but a coward since he would’ve stood out before if he had the courage.

Lin Yun smiled and threw the cup in his hand. The cup contained a powerful sword intent as it flew over, slamming against the purple-clothed middle-aged man’s forehead, causing his head to blow apart. This scene instantly left the entire hall silent, scaring everyone who was there.

They never expected that this young man to be so powerful. Third Master Lei was stunned because he was on the King Ranking, so his eyesight was naturally better than everyone here. He could tell that this young man was more terrifying than Bai Qingyu.

Lin Yun waved his hand and unleashed a sword aura. Facing the sword aura, Third Master Lei realized that he couldn’t dodge it. But he was a genius on the King Ranking, and he managed to avoid the sword aura at the last moment, but the sword aura still brushed past his arm. The pain made the corner of Third Master Lei’s lips twitch and he released his grip on the sword.

Lin Yun waved his hand and summoned the Stalewater Sword over. A powerful force also enveloped Bai Qingyu and brought her over to him before he held her in his arms. All of this happened in the blink of an eye.

“The poison is really powerful.” Lin Yun saw that the Nether Ghost Lesser Dragon’s blood had spread throughout Bai Qingyu’s body. It was like a black lesser dragon, spreading throughout her body like a tree, and there was a wisp of lingering thought within the blood. Bai Qingyu’s emotions would drastically change in the future if it was left unattended.

“Don’t touch me, you lecher!” Bai Qingyu struggled.

Lin Yun held onto her shoulder and circulated the Blue Dragon Bone. The Blue Dragon Bone could treat injuries and poison. So the Nether Ghost Lesser Dragon’s blood was nothing before it. Bai Qingyu was enveloped in a blue light very quickly, and her complexion was rapidly recovering.

“Kill him!” The Third Master Lei went insane when the Stalewater Sword was taken away and charged Lin Yun with the Thunder Eagle Stronghold’s members.

Lin Yun focused on treating Bai Qingyu with one hand while he faced them with the other. He even had time to pour himself a few cups of drinks during the fight. His sword aura was like a dragon, tearing the incoming people into shreds as screams were being yelled out.

Bai Qingyu’s face was pale. But her face became even paler with fright this time because this was her first time seeing such a bloody scene.

“How dare you!” The Third Master Lei was completely enraged, fully releasing his cultivation. When he released his aura, the entire hall lightly began to tremble. One must remember that this inn was fortified with natal saint runes, and even a Quasi-Saint might not be able to destroy this inn.

“Holy shit! He’s going all out!”

“Let’s leave quickly!” Many cultivators guessed that Third Master Lei must’ve used a secret technique to quickly boost his strength when they looked at his current state. They felt that this was related to that sword, but they didn’t dare to take any risk.

Just when they felt that the young man was doomed, Lin Yun poured himself a cup of wine with his left hand while he pressed down on Bai Qingyu’s shoulder and soared to the sky, coming before Third Master Lei in the blink of an eye.

When a finger hole appeared on Third Master Lei’s forehead, blood gushed out of the wound and Third Master Lei collapsed on the ground. His vitality had disappeared, and he was dead.

Lin Yun’s feet didn’t touch the ground, but he returned to his previous position and drank the cup of wine on the table. The surroundings fell silent, and everyone could feel a chill running down their spines as they gulped down a mouthful of saliva, looking at Lin Yun in horror.

Everything happened too quickly. They expected a battle between Lin Yun and Third Master Lei but never expected it to end so quickly. There were even some who couldn’t see how he had moved.

Right then, applause resounded as a bewitching woman, who was emitting charm from all over her body, appeared before everyone. The purple-clothed woman smiled, “As expected of someone who defeated Young Master Wushuang. I'm impressed that you were able to slaughter an expert on the King Ranking like you’re slaughtering a dog.”

Her words were like a bomb dropping on everyone as they turned to look at Lin Yun with shock in their pupils.

“He’s Ye Qingtian? The newly risen geniuses of the Heavenly Dao Sect?!”

“So he’s Ye Qingtian? It looks like the rumors aren’t false.”

“It should be him. There are rumors recently that he’s going to train in the Myriad Graves Valley.”

“I heard that his relationship with the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden made many people unhappy.”

Discussion resounded from the surroundings as many people gathered, wanting to look at Ye Qingtian.

On the other hand, Lin Yun frowned and wondered who this woman was. He could feel a familiar aura coming from her, but he couldn’t remember seeing her before.

Right then, nine people appeared behind this woman. They all wore armor engraved with saint runes that looked like crimson blood. On the breastplate, there was a blood moon drawn on it. That was the Nethermoon Saint Armor, and Lin Yun recognized it with a glance.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes because he had seen it before at the Martial Dao Tea Party. It was a treasure of the Blood Moon Sect. It could be considered as a unique Glory Saint Artifact. He still remembered how the two God Generals had suppressed everyone at the Martial Dao Tea Party, including the holy lands’ geniuses.

All nine people wore the Netherworld Saint Armor and seemed to be listening to this woman’s orders. So this meant this woman must have a high position within the Blood Moon Sect.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“She’s the Indigorobe Venerable, who only takes direct orders from the Blood Moon Divine Maiden.” Bai Qingyu said softly as she recovered.

Lin Yun found it strange because he had a feud with the Blood Moon Sect, but that should be “Lin Yun”. It had nothing to do with Ye Qingtian.

“Have you forgotten the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden? She’s probably related to the Blood Moon Sect,” Lil’ Purple whispered from the Iris Secret Realm.

“Ye Qingtian, tell me what you plan to do at the Myriad Graves Valley. Don’t tell me that you’re really going to look for the Udumbara Flower?” The Indigorobe Venerable smiled. Her smile was charming, and many men even wanted to kneel before her.

“What has Ye Qingtian’s objective at the Myriad Graves Valley got to do with a demoness like you?” Bai Qingyu said, looking at the Indigorobe Venerable.

“Haha. Ye Qingtian, don’t tell me you like a little girl like her? Why don’t you bring me to the Myriad Graves Valley? I’ll teach you some fun games that a brat like her doesn’t know about,” the Indigorobe Venerable said.

Bai Qingyu gritted her teeth and even wanted to charge over with her sword.

“No one is allowed to make trouble in the inn!” The shopkeeper of this inn finally appeared. It was common for scuffles to occur here, and the shopkeeper wouldn’t show himself if it weren’t something great.

But this involved a saint disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect and the Indigorobe Venerable of the Blood Moon Sect. So the shopkeeper had no choice but to stand out. The shopkeeper’s cultivation was at the Quasi-Saint Realm. He didn’t fear Lin Yun nor the Indigorobe Venerable, but their background.

“You guys can stay if you want to enter the God Burial Mountain Range and leave after buying the Bloodflame Crystale from me. Leave immediately if you guys aren’t going to the God Burial Mountain Range.” The shopkeeper said coldly as he looked at everyone.

The Indigorobe Venerable fell into deep thoughts, weighing the losses as she looked at Lin Yun with a smile. If one wanted to pass through the spatial crack, one would need the Bloodflame Crystal and wait for the spatial fluctuation to settle down.

The Bloodflame Crystal was special; not even the holy lands had many of them. On the contrary, the inn had a lot of them. There were many treehouse inns within the God Burial Forest, and few people knew the force behind these inns.

Lin Yun and Bai Qingyu bought a Bloodflame Crystal reach, and Bai Qingyu even paid for his. Lin Yun noticed that the Nirvana Pellets she took out were high grades one with close to no impurities. Anyone could tell with a glance that the pellets weren’t ordinary.

The shopkeeper’s eyes lit up, and smiled when he looked at the Nirvana Pellets, and Lin Yun naturally knew why he was smiling. The Nirvana Pellets that Bai Qingyu paid were equivalent to a dozen normal Nirvana Pellets, but she paid the same amount as everyone else.

“Ye Qingtian, do you like to drink wine?” Bai Qingyu asked. She pretended to casually take out a jar of wine and shoved it at Lin Yun without him agreeing to it. “This is a dragon clan’s wine that my grandfather gave me, and the name is Heart Incineration. Y-You can have it.”

She wanted to thank Lin Yun for saving her life, but her pride prevented her from doing so.

Dragon clan’s wine was incredibly precious to others, especially one with a name. But it wasn’t much to Lin Yun, but he still accepted it.

When dawn came, everyone held onto a Bloodflame Crystal and headed towards the God Burial Forest. There was a huge cave beneath them, which reeked of mystery and chill.

Lin Yun turned around to see the Indigorobe Venerable looking at him with a smile and her nine god generals following behind her. But that wasn’t all, Lin Yun even saw three familiar faces: Xiao Jingyan, Ye Qinghong, and Zhang Kui.

They had many experts behind them, and they were all probably at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage. They just didn’t know when to give up, for them to chase him all the way here from the Heavenly Dao Sect, not to mention they even utilized the forces of their clans. Their clans were Ancient Saint Clans, and they could easily dispatch many experts.

They were all looking at Lin Yun with ‘friendly’ smiles. This wasn’t the Heavenly Dao Sect, and Lin Yun’s identity as a Great Saint’s secluded disciple was useless here.
