Chapter 808 - Strongest Swordsman

Lin Yun was covered in blood and his injuries weren’t light. However, his fighting spirit was blazing brightly and his injuries didn’t affect him one bit.

Frowning, Nangong Wanyu took a deep breath and said, “I’ve never met anyone with your courage. If we continue to fight, I might not be able to outlast you given your physique. If you can take this sword head-on, I’ll give up.”

“This attack of mine is truly flawless!” Nangong Wanyu said with gnashed teeth. Clearly, he was emphasizing that this attack wasn’t the same as the one Li Mubai experienced. When he finished speaking, Nangong Wanyu gripped his sword tightly and a cold aura leaked out of his body once more.

Since his sword aura was comparable to a Heavenly Soul Realm expert, the frost sword intent became even more condensed while his face became even more flawless. When he poured his origin energy into his sword, the clouds covering the stage tumbled through the sky and turned black.

Within the boundless darkness, only Nangong Wanyu’s sword radiated brightly. At the same time, the clouds became so large that anyone could touch them if they reached out.

Nangong Wanyu’s cold aura sent chills down everyone’s spines. Even Yan Long’zi narrowed his eyes with excitement because he realized that he couldn’t see through Nangong Wanyu’s attack. He was full of emotion because he could already see Lin Yun getting torn apart.

Lin Yun didn’t dare to move as he waited for Nangong Wanyu to reveal his flaw. If he attacked right now to disrupt Nangong Wanyu’s attack, he would fall for the latter’s scheme. If you couldn’t find your opponent’s flaw, then you would expose your own flaws. It was a surefire death if he made a move right now.

“Flawless!” Nangong Wanyu barked and swung his sword down. With a huge explosion, the clouds were torn apart by his sword that emitted a dazzling radiance. His sword ray illuminated a layer of radiance on the stage as countless ice shards followed the descending sword.

Everyone could tell that this sword was a lot stronger than the one Li Mubai faced. In mid-air, Nangong Wanyu’s face radiated brightly, like a celestial. This breathtaking sword made many people’s hearts jolt violently, and it became hard for them to breathe. The sword truly deserved the name Flawless as it was the most perfect sword seen in the banquet.

“Great!” Contrary to everyone’s expectations, Lin Yun faced the terrifying sword with excitement. This was the sword that he risked injuring his eyes to see.

Although the name of this sword was flawless, there was no such thing as a genuinely flawless sword. Facing this breathtaking sword, Lin Yun soared into the sky and faced it head-on.

Overlord Sword–Thunderbolt Slash, Solar Slash, Big Bang, Breaking Dawn, and Blood Suppression!

In mid-air, Lin Yun brandished his sword and executed multiple overbearing sword techniques, shocking the spectators. Lin Yun was constantly analyzing and deciphering his techniques before fusing them together.

Faster! Faster! I have to be faster! Lin Yun continued to attack, facing Nangong Wanyu’s sword, looking as if he was sending himself to his death.

Suddenly, a golden halo rose behind Lin Yun, baffling everyone. Then, a crimson sun enveloped the entire heaven and earth in flames.

Overlord Sword–Supreme Dominance!

Pushing the Overlord Sword to the limit, Lin Yun finally released the sword aura that he built up. When his sword collided with Nangong Wanyu’s attack, a huge explosion rang out and a dazzling light rose like the dawn of morning. From the light, the audience detected a terrifying aura.

A moment later, the barrier covering the stage exploded. Immediately, the violent energy swept through the Nine Dragon Lake, creating multiple water screens three thousand meters tall. The result was multiple water screens that looked like sacred walls.

“What a shocking collision!”

“This should be the strongest attack right below the three kings.” Many elders stood up at this shocking scene. Even the seniors from the Northern Snow Manor stood up nervously, but it was a pity because they couldn’t see through the water screens.

When the water screens receded, the crowd carefully examined the stage. Then, they heard a cracking sound echo from the stage.

“Nangong Wanyu’s sword ray broke!” Exclamations sounded out because the shattering sound came from Nangong Wanyu. Clearly, many people couldn’t figure out how such a perfect sword technique could shatter.

As for the Northern Snow Manor’s party, they were dumbfounded.

“Previously, you asked me if I saw through your flaws. To be honest, I saw through everything. Your flaw lies in your heart.” Lin Yun looked at Nangong Wanyu’s pale face and continued, “There’s no such thing as a flawless sword. No matter how breathtaking and dazzling it is, there’s no way it can fix the flaw in your heart. Didn’t you expect this outcome?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Nangong Wanyu narrowed his pupils as his face became ugly. He thought of this possibility, but he never expected that anyone would guess it. But shortly after, his gaze became sharp, “Hmph, I will be defeated, but not by you. It won’t be that easy for you to win!”

His shattered sword ray became sharp once more and collided with Lin Yun’s sword. Nangong Wanyu was pouring all of his origin energy into his attack.

“You won’t have any more chances.” Lin Yun sighed. Over the past few years, he had experienced countless life and death situations, but he always relied on his heart as a swordsman. He heard of Nangong Wanyu’s name long ago, so he wouldn’t destroy Nangong Wanyu.

As a swordsman, he couldn’t bear to do it. After all, Nangong Wanyu wasn’t a bad person. In fact, Lin Yun had benefited greatly from him. But the path of a cultivator was brutal and someone had to be the strongest swordsman in the Ancient Southern Domain.

“Fight!” Dragon runes began to squirm on Lin Yun’s body before they poured into the Flower Burial Sword. When over a hundred dragon runes poured into his sword, a purple lightning dragon roared. The roar successfully added an azure dragon’s aura into Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent.

Along with the dragon roar, Lin Yun’s sword radiated brightly. At this moment, Nangong Wanyu had truly lost his chance. He was already on his wit's end and this was the final blow. When the lightning dragon dove down, Nangong Wanyu threw up a mouthful of blood and went flying.

Simultaneously, his sword flew out of his hand. A huge commotion broke out because this scene was unbelievable. No one expected that Nangong Wanyu would lose even after he held the advantage.

When the Flying Snow sword fell to the ground, it bounced several times before shattering into pieces.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun spread his arms apart and landed on the ground. The gaze of the fourth group’s judge briefly paused on Lin Yun before he declared, “Lin Yun wins!”
