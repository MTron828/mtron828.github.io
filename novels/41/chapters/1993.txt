Chapter 1994 - Myriad Graves Valley

As everyone entered the cave, Lin Yun saw another group watching him not too far away. This person was also familiar. It was Bai Yizhou of the Nether Orchid Courtyard. He was initially here with Xiao Jingyan and others, but he changed his mind after seeing Bai Qingyu.

He also had a group of Bai Clan experts behind him, and they were all at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage.

“Brother Yizhou, are we really not going to care about Qingyu?” A Bai Clan disciple asked. They were watching when Bai Qingyu faced the Thunder Eagle Stronghold the night before, but they were stopped by Bai Yizhou when they wanted to help.

“There’s no need,” Bai Yizhou replied.

“What if something happens?” Someone asked in a worried tone.

“That’s even better. If Bai Qingyu is dead, Ye Qingtian will be doomed. At that time, the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden will personally come for him,” Bai Yizhou smiled.

“Are we not going to do anything about Ye Qingtian, then? He forced the holy maiden away and even committed blasphemy against her multiple times…” Another Bai Clan disciple said. The Bai Clan’s disciples were long unhappy with Ye Qingtian’s actions within the Heavenly Dao Sect, especially after Bai Shuying left.

“It’s inconvenient for us to make a move with Bai Qingyu around,” Bai Yizhou said after a brief pondering. “Furthermore, the grudge between my Bai Clan and him isn’t as deep as the Zhang Clan and Ye Clan. There are plenty of people who want his life. Not to mention there’s something weird about this matter. It’s weird for Xiao Jingyan to lead the Wang Clan’s party, not to mention even the Blood Moon Sect has appeared.”

This was why Bai Yizhou changed his mind at the last minute and casually found an excuse to leave. But there was something else he didn’t say. He was shocked when he saw Ye Qingtian kill Third Master Lei yesterday.

Bai Yizhou naturally wouldn’t place someone like Third Master Lei in his eyes, and he was confident of killing someone like Third Master Lei when he was at the sixth or seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage. The saint disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect might not seem to have much difference from each other, but they were monstrous geniuses outside the sect.

Otherwise, everyone wouldn’t have tried their best to enter the holy lands. Not to mention they were geniuses, it was also a fact that they could become a saint’s disciples. With a saint personally teaching them, the difference between them and ordinary people would only grow even bigger. But Bai Yizhou couldn’t kill Third Master Lei as easily as Ye Qingtian did.

“We’ll enter after them. Since we’re already here, we naturally can’t go back empty-handed. We’ll go and take a look at the Divine Blood Flower’s situation. Perhaps there might be a chance for us,” Bai Yizhou said. It was already certain that Ye Qingtian would die since the three clans were joining forces. Even if Ye Qingtian wasn’t dead, they could probe Ye Qingtian’s trump cards.

Lin Yun held onto the Bloodflame Crystal and found himself in a completely different world after coming out of the cave. This space had no stars, the airflow wasn’t smooth, and the spiritual energy was thin. This should be the underground world of the God Burial Mountain Range.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see the rough outline of a city in the distance. That was an ancient Dragon City. The six holy lands currently manage it, and it was a safe zone in the underground world. The Dragon City was now called the Six Holy City, and someone like Xin Yan might be in the city.

Before everyone gathered, Lin Yun executed his movement technique and flew towards the Myriad Graves Valley.

When everyone saw Lin Yun executing his movement technique, they were briefly stunned before they chased after him. But the underground world was complicated, and Lin Yun easily shook them off.

Six hours later, Lin Yun came to a valley covered in crimson clouds, the Myriad Graves Valley. When he looked down at the valley, he could see many graves. It was just as rumored. The vitality and spiritual energy here was dense, and many flowers were growing around the graves.

Towering trees could be seen everywhere, and the flowers were bewitching, giving off a strong fragrance.

“The Myriad Graves Valley is bigger than I thought, and even some regions are covered in a mist. Empress, how can I find the Udumbara Flower?” Lin Yun could only seek help from Lil’ Purple. But Lil’ Purple seemed to be alarmed by something, and she didn’t reply to him. He asked, “What’s going on?”

Lil’ Purple uneasily said, “Lin Yun, there’s something weird about this palace, and there might be a divine array beneath this valley. Even at my pinnacle, I can’t set up this kind of divine array.”

Divine arrays were arrays set up with divine runes, and it was long lost in the Kunlun Realm. There were only spiritual arrays now; even an array fully created with saint runes could only be called a spiritual array. Divine arrays were rare, even in ancient times, and many deities feared them.

“H-How is that possible?” Lin Yun muttered. “The Myriad Graves Valley might be weird, but it shouldn’t be so dangerous. After all, people are training here often.”

“Those people are too weak, and they can’t trigger the array. It’s like an ant trying to shake an elephant,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun fell silent and squinted his pupils. He now realized that he was right to be coming here. If what Lil’ Purple said was true, it might not be a coincidence for Wang Yue to grasp Life Intent here.

“The Udumbara Flower might be the core of this divine array,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Let’s find it first. I might not need to take it away. I just need the Flower Burial Sword to devour the fragrance coming from it,” Lin Yun said.

“Okay, but let’s immediately leave if there’s any danger.” Lil’ Purple was cautious for once. She wasn’t this afraid, even when going to the Myriad Demon Peak.

“Since we know it’s the core of the divine array, it’s easier to find. We can just follow the runes.” Lil’ Purple said as the crimson and golden seals on her forehead bloomed beneath the Phoenix Tree in the Iris Secret Realm. The ancient array within the Iris Secret Realm was activated with the Phoenix Tree at the center.

“Found it!” When Lil’ Purple opened her eyes, she pointed in a direction for Lin Yun.

Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to jump into the Myriad Graves Valley with Lil’ Red behind him.

“Ye Qingtian!” A bark echoed as a figure descended from the sky. Bai Qingyu seemed to have been waiting here for a long time.

Lin Yun stopped when he saw Bai Qingyu and frowned, “Bai Qingyu, are you courting death to come here?”

“You think I don’t know what kind of place the Myriad Graves Valley is? This place might be dangerous, but it’s not a forbidden ground. So I don’t have to be afraid with my strength here,” Bai Qingyu snorted.

“Why are you following me, then,” Lin Yun said with a headache.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I’m naturally here waiting for you to be pursued. I’ll save you then to repay you for what you did. After that, we can have a fair fight,” Bai Qingyu said.

“I don’t need you to save me. You just stay here, and I’ll fight you when I return. You might die if you follow me,” Lin Yun persuaded.

“Hmph, who do you think you’re looking down on!” Bai Qingyu’s face became cold. “You have yet to see my true strength. If I go all out, I can easily level the entire Myriad Graves Valley.”

Suddenly, Lin Yun’s face changed as he dashed over. But it was too late. A crimson flash swiped down, the claws piercing Bai Qingyu’s shoulders and carrying her away. This was a Blood Crow that was close to three meters and enveloped in a crimson mist. It looked exactly like a crow except for having a human’s face and a crow’s beak.

The pain of being grabbed by the Blood Crow made Bai Qingyu’s face distorted. She couldn’t even draw her sword, and she began to struggle in panic. But the more she struggled, the deeper the claws dug into her. The blood mist around the Blood Crow was slowly entering Bai Qingyu’s body through her wound, and sinister crimson lines began to appear on her face, with her nirvana aura becoming chaotic.

“Hehe, this is actually a virgin. I bet your blood will be tasty!” The Blood Crow said.

“Your blood also smells tasty. Do you want to give it a try?” A cold voice came from above the Blood Crow. When the Blood Crow raised its head, a flash of golden radiance enveloped ten-odd miles of radius.
