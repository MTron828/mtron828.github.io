Chapter 548 - Unfinished Matter

As a silver beam shot into the sky, Lin Yun’s aura reached the Yang stage. There was no way Lin Yun could allow someone to snatch something that belonged to him. Revolving the sword array three times was a great burden to Lin Yun, but there was no way he could let this beast get the flower.

The entire lake started to tremble and the sword array that was initially three hundred meters grew to nine hundred meters, filling the surrounding atmosphere with a killing aura.

Gnashing his teeth with his eyes flickering coldly, Lin Yun roared, “Iris Sword Array—Absolute Unrivaled!”

Guided by his will, hundreds of silver swords streaked through the horizon like a milky way towards the python. When the swords came into contact with the python’s scales, they were instantly pierced through. The rain of swords continued to fall and riddled the python with holes.

As beads of sweat fell from Lin Yun’s forehead, he roared and he flew through the sky. The Flower Burial Sword in his hand released a silver brilliance that severed the python in two. When Lin Yun landed on the surface of the lake, he turned around and grabbed onto the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower.

Looking at the flower with his clothes fluttering in the wind, Lin Yun revealed a faint smile on his lips. This stunned all the disciples that wanted to make a play for the flower. They stopped their feet and didn’t dare to step forward.

Lin Yun stood at the heart of the lake as he emitted a silver radiance. The fluctuation of his sword intent intimidated everyone. This left all the opportunists feeling awkward. They didn’t know if they should advance or retreat.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun turned around as he revealed a smile, “What are you guys planning to do? Are you here to congratulate me?”

The disciples that were stunned quickly smiled and responded, “That’s right. We’re here to congratulate you.”

“You’re really lucky to obtain the flower king that only appears once a decade.”

“No one other than you is worthy of the flower.” Everyone praised Lin Yun contrary to how their hearts flet. Lin Yun even killed the Crimsonmist Python, so how could they do anything else aside from congratulating him?

With that, the competition had finally come to an end with the youth from the Great Qin Empire becoming the ultimate winner. This outcome had caught many people by surprise, but there was nothing they could do about it. First, Lin Yun defeated Yang Xiong. Then, he made Yang Xiong, Lu Zhan, and Qi Wenxiong kneel at his feet.

Furthermore, the silver brilliance that Lin Yun released at the end was so dazzling that none of them could look straight into it. All of them smiled bitterly at this outcome because there was nothing they could do except congratulate Lin Yun. No matter what, Lin Yun’s performance in the whole competition had been marvelous.

Without including his achievement of killing the python, his battle with Yang Xiong, Lu Zhan, and Qi Wenxiong was shocking enough. At this time, Tang Yu and Yu Mu, who were seated at the peak, had excitement on their faces. They never expected that Lin Yun would give them such a surprise. It seemed like they made the right choice.

“Dean, what do you think of this person?” Tang Yu asked with a smile.

The white-clothed elder smiled, “This lad is shocking indeed, but now I have to think of which pellet to refine for him.”

This reply made Tang Yu and Yu Mu exchange glances because the dean’s answer wasn’t clear. Simultaneously, Mo Ling revealed a smile on her lips. However, unlike her, Mei Ziyan’s face was dark. The fact that Lin Yun had obtained the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower was a slap to his face.

He said several times that he would make Lin Yun pay, but he was slapped in the face by Lin Yun instead. Not only was Lin Yun fine, but he even became the final winner and attracted the dean’s attention.

With the competition coming to an end, Lin Yun’s name spread throughout the academy instantly to the point that everyone knew about him. Even some of the elders who were in seclusion came to know that their academy had a monstrous guest deacon.

As for Lin Yun, he had to rest for two days before he completely recovered. What he said back then was to give all the other disciples a way out of the embarrassing situation. At that time, his origin energy was entirely exhausted, not to mention that he was also heavily injured in his battle with the python.

So if everyone swarmed him back then, he would definitely be beaten. But fortunately, his battle with Yang Xiong had intimidated everyone. After all, they had witnessed him slapping Yang Xiong so hard that he was sent flying.

The battle with Yang Xiong, Lu Zhan, and Qi Wenxiong wasn’t easy because he had practically used all his trump cards. But after that battle, there was no need for him to be concerned with Yang Xiong anymore.

On the other hand, Mei Ziyan was a little troublesome because he was in the pinnacle lesser Yang stage.

“It doesn’t matter…” Lin Yun opened his palm to reveal the Profound Yin Flower that emitted a faint fragrance. The fragrance alone made the silver origin energy in his violet palace start boiling. Lin Yun could sense a yearning coming from his body.

The Profound Yin Flower wasn’t much of a treasure, but it was incredibly attractive to Yin stage cultivators. Furthermore, it was still the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Let me take a look at how useful you are.” With that, Lin Yun spent the next few days refining the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower. There was naturally something special about this since it could be called the flower king.

This flower had a cold attribute, but it also contained an astonishing amount of origin energy. This was a great source of nourishment for any cultivator, which made it easy for anyone to refine. With that, Lin Yun’s cultivation had undergone a huge transformation over the next few days.

The effects were even greater than the Profound Yin Pellets that he got from Mei Ziyan. In just five days, Lin Yun had reached the pinnacle greater Yin stage after completely refining the flower.

As Lin Yun let out a long breath, he slowly opened his eyes and his pupils flashed with great pressure. Not only did his cultivation grow significantly, but his temperament had also undergone a transformation. If someone was here, they would definitely be able to feel that Lin Yun’s pressure wasn’t any less than Mei Ziyan’s.

“If I run into Yang Xiong again, I’m confident that I can defeat him within ten moves,” muttered Lin Yun.

If he ran into Mei Ziyan, he might not be able to win, but it wouldn’t be a problem for him to protect himself. It shouldn’t be a problem for him to leave unscathed. Also,if he were to bring out all his strength, Lin Yun was confident that he could intimidate Mei Ziyan with his Iris Sword Array and Thunderbolt Crusher. If he was forced into a corner, he could even revolve the Iris Sword Array five times.

“Hmmm?” Right at this moment, Lin Yun could sense someone approaching his courtyard. When he raised his head, he saw a figure infiltrating his courtyard. It was Mo Ling, whom he hadn’t seen for days.

Mo Ling looked at Lin Yun with surprise, “You’re rather impatient to refine it so quickly. How do you feel now?”

“Not bad. I’m one step away from the pinnacle Yin stage now,” smiled Lin Yun.

Mo Ling frowned, “Know when to be satisfied. You’ve barely made a breakthrough into the Violet Palace Realm two months ago. With your speed of improvement, you can be considered a monstrous genius even in the overlord forces.”

Lin Yun smiled and asked, “What brings you here?”

“Looks like you’ve already forgotten about the Ablaze Phoenix Painting. Since that’s the case, then I’ll leave.” Mo Ling turned around and left.

Lin Yun smacked his forehead and smiled bitterly. He had forgotten about this matter. He quickly caught up to Mo Ling and appeared in front of her before she could leave.
