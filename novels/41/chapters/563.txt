Chapter 564 - Power of One Sword

“They’re actually evenly matched!” The White Jade Academy’s Cao Xiu was surprised by this scene. He never expected that the Heavenly Province Academy actually had someone so capable aside from Mu Xue. This was the youth that he thought he could easily suppress back then.

“Is this the person who humiliated my younger brother?” said Chen Yu with interest.

“That’s him,” said Cao Xiu.

Chen Yu fanned himself and sneered, “Let me deal with him. Hehe, it would be boring to defeat him if he was weak.”

“Let’s talk about that if he wins. Jiang Yi isn’t a pushover,” said the youth with a greatsword behind him.

Cao Xiu glanced at this person. This person’s eyes were rather keen since he could tell that Jiang Yi had yet to bring out the full power of the Primal Chaos Art. Clearly, this wasn’t all of Jiang Yi’s strength. If this was all Lin Yun had, then he would lose sooner or later.

While the three chatted among themselves, the battle on the stage became even more intense. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Thundermine Hand!” Jiang Yi stretched out his right hand as purple lightning flowed on his palm. In the next second, boundless thunderclouds began to surge over.

This terrifying phenomenon naturally had to be created with the support of origin energy. Jiang Yi had finally started to unleash his true power. But before he could finish his attack, a brilliant sword buzz rang out. It was a xiantian sword intent that was near perfection that surged out of Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun’s sword aura reached the pinnacle, his punch was like a sword that was imbued with a silver brilliance.

When the purple lightning and silver fist clashed, a violent energy exploded out. Seeing that he couldn’t injure Lin Yun, Jiang Yi’s face changed. Then, he stepped forward and clenched his hands together to throw his punches out.

The might of the Thundermine Hand supported by a cultivation in the lesser Yang stage was terrifying. But even when facing this attack, there were no changes to Lin Yun’s face. On the contrary, the fighting spirit in his eyes grew even more ferocious as he soared into the sky.

Since Jiang Yi wanted a fight, then he would give Jiang Yi a fight! The two began to clash with their fists. The collision between lightning and sword aura created an explosion that resounded in everyone’s ears.

“Primal Chaos Thundermine Hand!” Jiang Yi barked as his right hand flowed with a transparent purple glow. At the same time, the phenomenon created by his attack multiplied by twice. Bolts of lightning shot down from the sky and made Jiang Yi look invincible in mid-air.

Jiang Yi slammed his palm down as the gigantic purple palm dove down. The moment it landed, Lin Yun’s sword aura began to crumble. A second later, Lin Yun’s sword aura crumbled completely.

“Oh shit!” The hearts of everyone in the Heavenly Province Academy dropped. Even the elders couldn’t help reacting as Jiang Yi was too powerful.

“This is the true foundation of an overlord force!”

“How powerful! There’s no way Lin Yun can face this head-on.” Discussions rose in the surroundings and everyone thought that Lin Yun had lost. However, they all seemed to be forgetting something.

Lin Yun summoned the Flower Burial Sword and the sword buzzed in his hand with excitement. With a cold light in Lin Yun’s eyes, he smiled as he swung his sword. He quickly executed the Aquaselenic Sword—Luminous Moon.

The moment Lin Yun drew his sword, his sword aura began to gather as his xiantian sword intent soared into the sky in the form of a silver sword ray. The sword ray was like a dazzling moon that instantly pierced the purple palm, causing cracks to appear.

Seven Profound Steps—Golden Crow Wings!

Lin Yun spread his arms apart as he soared into the sky towards the gigantic purple palm. Shortly after, the palm crumbled as a terrifying aura spread out. With a cloud of dust rising up, everyone could vaguely see a figure falling onto the ground.

“Flower Burial, you really deserve your reputation.” Jiang Yi coughed out blood as he never imagined that Lin Yun would be so powerful after drawing his sword. Not only him, but no one here had imagined that Lin Yun would be so powerful.

Jiang Yi’s eyes flashed with surprise. Lin Yun’s friend from the Great Qin Empire said that Lin Yun was totally different the moment he drew his sword. It looked like it was true.

“I guess I have to use my full strength. Being a disciple of the Cloud Trigram Sect doesn’t give me any advantage against him,” smiled Jiang Yi as he muttered to himself. In the next moment, his eyes blazed with flames.

Traces of blood began to appear on his pale face as he pushed the Primal Chaos Art to the limit. Then, his pupils became intense like flames. Along with that, a bright radiance began to spread out and everyone could clearly sense how powerful Jiang Yi had become.

“That’s the Primal Chaos Nine Transformation!”

“This should be the first transformation. The Primal Chaos Art is truly special because its reputation is widely known in the Ancient Southern Domain.”

“I heard that this cultivation technique is extremely terrifying and the first transformation can multiply the user’s physical strength and origin energy. Legend has it that upon reaching the ninth transformation, one can destroy a city with a single flick.”

“Looks like Jiang Yi is getting serious now.” Everyone here could tell how terrifying this cultivation technique was. So when they saw Jiang Yi using the first transformation, their faces became grave.

“I guessed correctly. After all, Jiang Yi had cultivated the Primal Chaos Art to the eighth stage,” said Cao Xiu of the White Jade Academy.

Chen Yu spoke without any changes to his face, “He’s indeed worthy of being ranked in the top ten among the Cloud Trigram Sect’s inner disciples. It’s fortunate that I don’t have to face him.”

However, the youth with the greatsword, Luo Shen, had no changes to his face as he had already expected this. However, he wasn’t optimistic of Lin Yun defeating Jiang Yi.

“I’m sorry. You might be able to surpass me in half a year, but I don’t have a choice now because I have to win. You should surrender,” said Jiang Yi calmly after he brought out his full power.

His voice was calm, but everyone could hear the absolute confidence and pride in his tone. He was determined to win this battle.

“Surrender? You can say that again after watching this,” smiled Lin Yun as he shook his right hand to execute the Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slasher.

The brilliant lightning blinded everyone’s vision. When they recovered their vision a moment later, all of their faces changed as there was a huge gulf stretching out from Lin Yun’s feet to Jiang Yi.

When they looked at Jiang Yi, they noticed that the flames around him had died down under this attack. His aura had also reached rock bottom. Not many people could tell how Lin Yun attacked, but for those who could, they were deeply shocked.

Jiang Yi’s face was pale as his right hand began to tremble violently and his heart throbbed. He knew that Lin Yun had missed this attack on purpose.

Lin Yun had practiced the Overlord Sword to the second style, so he could control the first style as he wished without needing to accumulate his energy. If Lin Yun bothered accumulating his energy, then the power of this sword would be even more terrifying.

“Still not enough?” Lin Yun said as boundless thunderclouds began to gather above him. In the next second, the thunderclouds formed a vortex that formed into a dragon that entered Lin Yun’s body.

“I surrender,” said Jiang Yi as he gnashed his teeth with shock in his eyes.

“Thank you for the battle,” said Lin Yun as he dispersed his attack. No one had expected that Jiang Yi would end up surrendering.
