Chapter 628 - Heavenly Soul’s Might

What makes someone a genuine swordsman? What kind of genius deserved to be called a monstrous genius? Only someone who could reduce everything to ashes like Lin Yun deserved to be called a genuine swordsman and a monstrous genius!

The sword buzz continued to envelop heaven and earth as the dazzling light from the rose blinded everyone’s eyes. The terrible deaths of the three Bloodwing Pavilion’s elders were still fresh in everyone’s mind and their hearts jolted violently.

When everything settled down, Lin Yun’s youthful figure was clearly revealed before everyone’s eyes as he sheathed his sword. Lin Yun was at the center of attention.

“They’re dead?”

“Are they really dead?” Everyone recovered from their shock after a long time with disbelief in their voices.

“Are they really dead? Isn’t he a little too terrifying? He managed to kill three Yin-Yang stage elders even after they brought out their martial souls?”

“His sword technique is terrifying, not to mention that he can empower it with his xiantian sword intent at complete mastery. But how did he manage to kill three elders in a split second?”

No one could deny that Lin Yun was strong, especially after witnessing his fight with Ji Wuye. Everyone’s opinion of the swordsman from the Great Qin Empire had completely changed. When they saw his sword intent and the Dustlight Sword Art, their evaluation of him had reached a whole new height. They knew that his name would spread throughout the Ancient Southern Domain sooner or later.

No one could have imagined that Lin Yun would be able to kill three Yin-Yang stage elders at the same time.

“Damn it...is he really just eighteen?! Can it be that I will have to be suppressed by him for the rest of my life?” Ji Wuye was kneeling on the ground while recovering from his injuries. He was heavily injured during his battle with Lin Yun. It wasn’t something that he could recover from anytime soon. So his face turned red when he saw Lin Yun kill the three elders and vomited blood in response.

His injuries were serious and would need at least a month to recover. However, watching Lin Yun made his condition even worse.. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Bai Lixuan’s face was also looking a bit ugly after watching Lin Yun. He already knew that there was a huge gap between him and Lin Yun back in the empyrean’s tomb, but he never expected that it would be so vast.

Many people were numb while others sighed, “I once heard that Ji Wuye slew a Yin-Yang stage expert. Lin Yun could defeat Ji Wuye without bringing all his strength, so it makes sense for him to have such power.”

“Indeed. No one would be so shocked if it was Ji Wuye who slew the three elders. But it’s shocking since Lin Yun is just a newcomer with a decent reputation.”

“The Ancient Southern Domain will change. More geniuses are rising up, but those geniuses on the inner rankings are even more terrifying.”

“This Draconic Banquet will probably be an interesting one. There are many underdogs that we aren’t accounting for.”

“Not good!” Right at this moment, a terrifying aura soared into the sky that caught everyone by surprise. In the next second, the sound of a sword shattering rang in everyone’s ears. Lin Yun’s sword intent broke into pieces and his sword aura entirely suppressed.

Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood as his face paled and twisted from pain. His sword intent was a total mess and all of his internal organs were wounded. This had caught him by surprise.

“It’s a Heavenly Soul Realm expert!”

“T-this is too much!” Only a Heavenly Soul Realm expert can shatter a xiantian sword intent at complete mastery. Then, everyone turned to look at the Bloodwing Pavilion’s Heavenly Soul Realm expert.

Although the martial world was where the strong preyed on the weak, it was a rule that no seniors were allowed to lay hands on a junior. Otherwise, no disciples would be able to come out of their sects. Even geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking couldn’t put up a stand against those from the older generation.

There would be chaos if anyone broke the rule. It was shameless enough that three Yin-Yang stage elders ganged up on Lin Yun. So it was even more ridiculous for a Heavenly Soul Realm expert to attack Lin Yun.

“Haha, I’ve widened my experience today…”

“The Bloodwing Pavilion is actually still called a quasi-overlord force? Let’s see how they stay in the Nether Prefecture in the future.”

“They have broken my understanding of shamelessness.”

Despite the surrounding discussions, Wu Feng completely ignored them. After he shattered Lin Yun’s sword intent, he soared into the sky and threw his palm at Lin Yun.

Thunderclouds began to roll as a terrifying phenomenon appeared. Even someone in the Yin-Yang stage couldn’t take a palm from a Heavenly Soul Realm expert. Just when everyone thought that Lin Yun was going to die, a figure appeared before Wu Feng and blocked his attack.

The clash unleashed bolts of lightning into the sky as if it were about to tear the sky apart.

“Another Heavenly Soul Realm expert!” Naturally, only another Heavenly Soul Realm expert could block Wu Feng’s attack.

“Senior Tang Yu…” Lin Yun was shocked to see Tang Yu standing before him.

“You want to thank me? Save that till you’re safe. Go!” Tang Yu smiled as he patted Lin Yun on the shoulder.

Before Lin Yun could open his mouth, he was already a thousand meters away. At the same time, Lin Yun was shocked to discover that the fragments of his sword intent had been entirely suppressed.

Wu Feng was furious that Tang Yu stood up. Just when he was about to chase after Lin Yun, Tang Yu appeared before him with a smile. Enraged, he yelled at Tang Yu, “Old geezer, you want to stand against me for a guest deacon?”

Tang Yu wasn’t bothered by those words as he replied, “He’s the benefactor of the academy. I’ll protect him even if he’s only an outsider. My academy isn’t as shameless as your pavilion. We naturally know how to pay back to our benefactors.”

“Then let me see how you’ll protect him. His sword intent has already shattered, so now he’s just a cripple. Bloodwing Pavilion listen up, chase after that brat! Don’t let him leave the Withernorth Sea!” Wu Feng barked.

In the next second, the remaining people from the Bloodwing Pavilion soared into the sky as they chased after Lin Yun.

“Protect Lin Yun!” Mo Ling charged forward with the academy’s party. Zhang Yuan, however, hesitated before he eventually drew his sword and went to help the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples.

The situation was thrown into complete chaos with two Heavenly Soul Realm experts facing off in the sky and a bunch of people slaughtering each other on the ground. But everyone’s attention was on Lin Yun who was sent flying out.

“My chance!” Ji Wuye’s eyes flickered, but he wasn’t in a hurry to make his move. Everyone knew that Lin Yun’s trump card was his sword intent. Without his sword intent, there was no way he could fight those stronger than him, not to mention that his sword intent had been shattered by a Heavenly Soul Realm expert. This meant that it was impossible for him to recover his sword intent anytime soon.

Although the death of the three elders was shocking, this also meant that Lin Yun had exhausted most of his origin energy. So this was the best opportunity for him to kill Lin Yun.

“You’ll only die prematurely if you shine too brightly…” sneered Yan Kong. But just when he was about to make his move, a cold gaze landed onto him. When he turned around, he saw that the gaze came from Bai Lixuan. He grinned, “I heard that both of you are from the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Do you think you can block me?”

Yan Kong began to unleash his killing aura. However, before his killing aura could reach Bai Lixuan, Xie Yunqiao stepped forward, “I can probably block you. What do you think?”

“Senior brother…” Bai Lixuan was shocked as he looked at Xie Yunqiao.

This instantly droze Yan Kong insane as he spoke out solemnly, “Xie Yunqiao, why are you helping that brat? Don’t tell me that you don’t want his Astral Pearl!”

“ I naturally don’t like him, but I like my junior brother. Since you don’t want to fight me, then you should behave yourself and stay here,” said Xie Yunqiao as the other disciples from the Cloud Trigram Sect came over.

“Damn it!” Yan Kong gnashed his teeth as this golden opportunity was actually ruined by them.

Right at this moment, two figures soared into the sky and instantly attracted everyone’s attention. When Yan Kong saw who they were, he laughed, “Those pieces of trash actually took advantage of the situation…”

The two figures were naturally Qin An and Pei Yue!
