Chapter 506 - Set Off, Nether Prefecture!

“Lin Yun, what do you intend to do with these interspatial pouches?” smiled Liu Yunyan. The Bloodwing Pavilion and Threesolute Manor had suffered a great loss this time, plus they brought this upon themselves.

“I only need the spiritual jades,” said Lin Yun as he turned around preparing to leave.

“Where are you going?” Liu Yunyan and the other disciples quickly asked.

“I’ll be back shortly,” smiled Lin Yun. After dealing with Pan Yue and Han Fei, there was still one more person waiting for him.

In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun disappeared. Liu Yunyan fell silent as she could guess where Lin Yun was going. She couldn’t help being surprised by how grudgeful Lin Yun was.

In the forest ten miles away, there was an array that was currently using a thousand third grade spiritual jades. At the core of the array were many bones that belonged to the Draconian Rockrats. At the center of the array, was a youth who was suddenly throwing up a mouthful of blood. His face had become so pale.

“Lin Yun, I’ll kill you!” Behind the mask that he wore, his eyes radiated with killing aura. The Draconian Rockrat King was a greater Yin stage demonic beast that he barely managed to control using his heart’s blood as a cost. He initially wanted to control it to slaughter the Heavenly Province Academy’s party, but he never expected that it would be killed by Lin Yun with one attack.

He was truly shocked by Lin Yun’s strength. The Draconian Rockrat King’s death instantly caused a backlash for him. So, he quickly closed his eyes to recuperate from his injuries.

But shortly after, a wild gale blew and Leng Yi opened his eyes to see a youth standing not too far away from him. “Lin Yun!”

His heart jolted wildly because he never expected that Lin Yun would find him so quickly. Couldn’t Pan Yue and Han Fei even stop him briefly? What were those pieces of trash doing? If he knew this would have happened, he would’ve left this place immediately when he suffered the backlash.

“You’re actually still here? Great, that’ll save me time,” said Lin Yun calmly. It didn’t matter if Leng Yi ran away because he was already a dead person the moment Lin Yun wanted to kill him. Compared to Pan Yue and Han Fei, Leng Yi had too many means and he couldn’t be kept alive.

“What arrogance!” Leng Yi barked as the array beneath him suddenly released a ghastly howl. In the next second, the pile of skulls spit out a thick black mist that swept towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun merely raised his hand and threw a punch out. This punch was empowered by the Demon Vanquishing Seal, which released a radiating golden brilliance. With only one punch, the skulls crumbled and broke into pieces.

“Lin Yun, we’ll meet again. I swear that I’ll let you taste pain beyond death one day…” A weird laughter came from Leng Yi as his body turned into mist.

A cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes and he raised the Flower Burial Sword in his hand. A silvery ray crackled and flew out, sending Leng Yi flying away. All the trees in the way of Lin Yun’s sword were curved in an exaggerated angle and they bounced back when Lin Yun sheathed his sword.

“You want to kill me? It’s a pity that you won’t have this chance!” Leng Yi had already left, but Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with him and instead turned all his attention to the third grade spiritual jades in the array. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Outside the Bloodbone Mountain Range, Pan Yue was waiting anxiously. In the end, Han Fei couldn’t help but to ask, “Leng Yi is still not here? He’s not dead, right?”

Pan Yue’s face was extremely ugly. Leng Yi hadn’t arrived after so long, which could only mean one thing. Leng Yi was probably killed by Lin Yun. Aside from this, there were no other possibilities. Pan Yue gnashed his teeth, “Lin Yun is really bold to kill the Nethercloud Ghost’s disciple. Is he really not afraid of death?”

Leng Yi was someone he invited over to help and the Nethercloud Ghost wouldn’t let him off if anything happened to Leng Yi.

“Brother Pan, it doesn’t really matter if Leng Yi is dead or not. With Nethercloud Ghost’s personality, he won’t let Lin Yun off either way,” sneered Han Fei. If he was Lin Yun, he also wouldn’t let Leng Yi off.

“You’re going to swallow this down after suffering such a huge loss?” Pan Yue raised his head.

“I now know why the Shattered Sword Pavilion wasn’t willing to join us. We’re disciples of quasi-overlord forces. How humiliating was it for us to work with a wandering cultivator? Not to mention that we even got robbed instead. But what can we do about it? Are we going to depend on our sects to help us?” replied Han Fei as he glanced at Pan Yue. He naturally couldn’t get the sect to help him out in such a humiliating matter. It would be great if he wasn’t punished.

“On the other hand, think of how you should explain it to Nethercloud Ghost. That old geezer is insane when he becomes mad,” said Han Fei before he left with the Threesolute Manor’s disciples.

“Damn it!” Pan Yue was trembling in rage, but there was nothing he could do about it. He tried to rob the Heavenly Province Academy, but he got robbed instead. So what could he do about it? If he had another chance, he would definitely not choose to provoke Lin Yun again.

Waves swept through the Raging Dragon River, making it worthy of its name. Lin Yun stood on the deck and observed the river. It had been four days since they left the Bloodbone Mountain Range.

In the past four days, Lin Yun had been in seclusion to stabilize his cultivation by using the thousand third grade spiritual jades. After he stabilized his cultivation, the Iris Flower grew to seventy-three petals. In the end, his speculation was right because he needed to reach theViolet Palace Realm before he could resume his cultivation in the Iris Sword Sutra.

One thousand third grade spiritual jades for a petal was a headache to Lin Yun. Since the Iris Sword Sutra was an ancient cultivation technique, the resources he needed were naturally higher than other techniques.

“You’re finally out? And here I thought you would be in seclusion until we reached Nether Prefecture,” smiled Liu Yunyan.

Lin Yun initially had those thoughts, but he had already consumed all his spiritual jades, so he had no other choice but to come out from seclusion. “Miss Liu, what other requirements does a guest deacon have aside from being recommended by a core disciple? I bet there is a test, right?”

He was looking forward to becoming a guest deacon because he hoped to bring his cultivation in spiritual runes to another level. Also, he needed the academy’s help to decipher the rose painting’s secret.

“There’s naturally a test if you’re not recommended by a core disciple. But the test is just a formality if you have a core disciple’s recommendation. But guest elders are divided into ranks. If you can’t show your worth, you won’t get a good position,” replied Liu Yunyan. Through the Indigocloud Lake’s experience, their relationship had improved. Lin Yun’s figure on the lake had also left a deep impression on Liu Yunyan.

“Display my worth?” Lin Yun fell into deep thought, but he wasn’t surprised. After all, he naturally had to show his worth for the academy to place importance in him.

“With your age and talent, you’re more than qualified to join the academy. But I guess that you won’t take that option,” smiled Liu Yunyan. If Lin Yun was willing, he could easily join the academy. But she had guessed that with his personality he didn’t like restrictions. Plus, he wouldn’t leave the Firmament Sword Pavilion before the Draconic Banquet.

But although being a guest deacon had freedom, they were on a lower level than the sects’ disciples. So Lin Yun naturally had to display his worth. Take the Nethercloud Ghost, for example. He was initially a demonic cultivator, but the Bloodwing Pavilion invited him due to his worth.

“You understand me pretty well,” smiled Lin Yun. No matter what, he wouldn’t leave the Firmament Sword Pavilion before the Draconic Banquet.
