Chapter 2164: I’m Refuse!

The divine dragon lords received the Divine Dragon’s blood, Divine Dragon Bone, and Dragon Blood Pellets, and they had even refined the divine dragon aura to temper their physiques, so their rewards were enough to drive anyone insane from jealousy. Not only Gu Xiyan, but many people began to wonder what reward would Ye Qingtian receive as the Heavenly Dragon Lord.

Mu Xueling and the official began to discuss amongst themselves with their faces changing and didn’t announce the reward for the Heavenly Dragon Lord.

“Don’t tell me that there’s not going to be any reward?”

“Highly possible. Look at the divine dragon bones and blood, they’re clearly prepared in advance. They’re probably provided by the Divine Dragon Empire, and it’s clear that they didn’t prepare anything for the Heavenly Dragon Lord.”

“Who could have expected that the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title would appear? Furthermore, how can the Divine Dragon Empire possibly possess a Heavenly Dragon Bone?”

“The Heavenly Dragon is above the seven divine dragons, and the value of a Heavenly Dragon Bone is something that even an Emperor would be tempted to make a move for. So even if the Divine Dragon Empire possessed it, it’s impossible for them to take it out.” There were discussions amongst everyone.

“Those at the Dragon’s Tail will receive an additional Heavenly Origin Pellet.” Mu Xueling swept past Lin Yun and continued to announce the rewards. The Heavenly Origin Pellet was a precious saint pellet that could greatly aid someone in comprehending saint dao. A Heavenly Origin Pellet was equivalent to comprehending saint dao, and there was an opportunity for one to comprehend a greater dao.

“They will also reward Heavenly Origin Pellets?”

“Isn’t this too insane? Those on the Dragon’s Tail can receive a Heavenly Origin Pellet.”

“Hehe. With the Heavenly Origin Pellet, there’s a high chance that I can grasp a greater dao.” All the cultivators on the Dragon Mountain looked excited.

“Those on the Dragon’s Torso will receive an additional reward of ten Heavenly Origin Pellets, and dragon lords will receive a jar of Millennium Flame aside from the ten Heavenly Origin Pellets.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun couldn’t help taking a gulp because it had been a long time since he drank the Millennium Flame. The Millennium Flame might not be able to bring any benefits to him, but he couldn’t forget the taste even after all this time.

But when it came to the Heavenly Dragon Lord, Mu Xueling skipped through him again as though he didn’t exist. But the reward hadn’t come to an end because she would be announcing the reward of Dragon Clan’s martial techniques. “Those on the Dragon’s Tail will receive low-grade ghost spirit martial techniques or even secret techniques.”

Hearing that, all the cultivators on the Dragon Mountain became insane because the reward was too generous. When it came to the nine dragon lords, their rewards were even more generous because they could pick a Dragon Clan’s body-refining technique.

With the dragon bones, it would be a lot easier for them to practice the Dragon Clan’s body-refining technique. The last reward was Glory Saint Artifacts, but it wasn’t that generous this time because only those who were on the Dragon’s Claw could receive one. As for the nine dragon lords, they could receive a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact. Furthermore, those at the Dragon’s Claw and above would receive a Saint Blood Lotus.

The rewards were beyond generous after all of them were added together. Everyone could imagine that this would produce a group of terrifying Quasi-Saint Realm experts. Those ranked from the Dragon’s Claw and above could even reach the Heavenly Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm within six months.

This was something unimaginable in the past. After all, those in the Heavenly Origin Phase had to form their sacred flame for their saint origin in the future, or they would be reduced to ashes if they weren’t careful. Many people accumulated for a hundred years and couldn’t even reach the Heavenly Origin Phase because they died.

Quasi-Saints might not be considered overlords in the Kunlun Realm, but they definitely had a high status. The more they had, the greater they would be afraid to lose. But it was different now with so many rewards from the Blue Dragon Record. With all the rewards combined, they would bring their foundation to an unprecedented height in this generation. Most importantly, they would even be rewarded with the Saint Blood Lotus, which was a weakened version of the Divine Blood Fruit.

It might not be useful to saints, but it was a treasure to Quasi-Saints since it could increase the odds of their breakthrough. Even if they failed, the Saint Blood Lotus could protect their physique and soul, saving their lives from being burned to ashes. But all of the rewards had nothing to do with Lin Yun because all he received was a Dragon Origin.

Although the Dragon Origin had a huge origin that could even repel his Astral Sword Intent, it couldn’t be considered a reward for him since it was given to him by the remnant soul of the Heavenly Dragon after feeling guilty. He muttered to himself, “So… am I forgotten?”

If that was the case, was there still a need to compete for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title? But he didn’t have a choice because Su Ziyao had given the word.

“Saint Elder, why isn’t there any reward for Ye Qingtian?” The Dao Yang Holy Son spoke out before Lin Yun could express his unhappiness as he looked at Mu Xueling.

“That’s right. Why is our senior brother the only one without rewards?”

“This isn’t fair!”

“So the champion of the Blue Dragon Record can’t even be compared to someone on the Dragon’s Claw?” After the Dao Yang Holy Son spoke up, his words received the acknowledgment of many, especially disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect.

The other dragon lords didn’t say anything because they had already noticed this, but they were rejoicing despite not saying anything. If it was just as they had speculated that the Heavenly Dragon Lord was unexpected, then there obviously wouldn’t be any reward.

They could undergo a great boost in their strength with the rewards they received, and they would be able to form their advantage after reaching the Heavenly Origin Phase.

The White Dragon Lord, Ye Linghao, who was the Champion of the Second Heavenly Path questioned, “Dao Yang Holy Son, are you questioning the Saint Elder?”

The Green Dragon Lord followed along, “You were just waiting for the Saint Elder to hand out so many rewards. To receive so many rewards, we should be grateful to the Saint Elder and the Empress!”

Many people echoed along since the Saint Elder had a high prestige now. The moment they brought out Mu Xueling, they immediately suppressed the surrounding voices.

But the Dao Yang Holy Son was fearless as he looked at Mu Xueling, and said, “I didn’t think that deeply. I only know that this isn’t fair, and I would rather give up on the rewards if there’s no explanation. Whoever wants the Azure Dragon Lord’s title can feel free to take it away.”

The moment Dao Yang Holy Son said that, the other dragon lords were left speechless. Was the Heavenly Dao Sect so arrogant?

“Senior Brother, please calm down. Don’t be impulsive.” Lin Yun was touched as he persuaded the Dao Yang Holy Son. He could be considered to be on Mu Xueling’s side, so he believed that Mu Xueling wouldn’t treat him badly. But he couldn’t possibly tell the Dao Yang Holy Son that.

“This isn’t fair!” Dao Yang Holy Son said indignantly.

Lin Yun tried his best to comfort the Dao Yang Holy Son, who finally suppressed his emotions.

“The Blue Dragon Record’s vault hasn’t opened yet, and a key is lacking. The rewards now are all given by the Divine Dragon Empire, and there’s no reward prepared for the Heavenly Dragon Lord,” Mu Xueling said.

This made everyone’s faces change, but they weren’t too surprised because they already had their speculations.

“But… the Divine Dragon Empire won’t treat the Heavenly Dragon Lord unfairly,” the official beside Mu Xueling said. She continued, “I have just received the order that you can freely pick any of the Divine Dragon Bones, and you will be given twice the rewards of other dragon lords, including the Saint Blood Lotus.”

An uproar broke out the moment that was announced. The dragon lords’ rewards were already generous with a hundred Dragon Blood Pellets, a droplet of the Divine Dragon’s blood, a Divine Dragon Bone, a Dragon Clan’s martial technique, a Saint Blood Lotus, and a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact. Each was unbelievably valuable, but they would all be given to Ye Qingtian at twice the portion. The reward was a little too generous.

“I’m fine with that,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Aside from that, the Empress wants to take you in as her disciple. Ye Qingtian, are you willing to become the Empress’ disciple?” Zi Ling smiled. Ye Qingtian might not have a good reputation, but that was nothing compared to his talent. If he took the Empress as his master, the Divine Dragon Empire would have a future powerhouse, not to mention Ye Qingtian could become a Sword Saint within ten years.

This was also a glory for Lin Yun, and Zi Ling was only going through the procedures by asking Ye Qingtian. After all, she didn’t believe that anyone would refuse the Empress. This was an opportunity that many people would beg for, so there was no reason for Ye Qingtian to refuse.

“How is that possible?”

“Isn’t this a little too much? Is Ye Qingtian really going to become the next Jian Jingtian?”

“Will the Heavenly Dao Sect agree to it?”

“There’s nothing the Heavenly Dao Sect can do. Ye Qingtian isn’t a holy son within the Heavenly Dao Sect. Furthermore, does the Heavenly Dao Sect dare to look for the Empress?” Everyone on the Dragon Mountain was shocked. Even the White Dragon Lord and Green Dragon Lord who doubted Lin Yun earlier were dumbfounded. Not only was Ye Qingtian given twice the rewards, but he would even have the glory of becoming the Empress’ disciple.

The Nine Emperors were mythical figures, not to mention that the Empress was the ruler of the Divine Dragon Empire. So it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the Empress was the owner of half of the Kunlun Realm.

.

“I’ll consider it.” But surprisingly, Lin Yun didn’t agree to it immediately.

“Do you still need to consider it?” Zi Ling frowned.

“Well, I don’t,” Lin Yun replied. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Zi Ling smiled upon hearing that. But when she heard what Lin Yun said next, her face sank.

“I’m only trying to refuse tactfully, but I’ll make it clear now. I already have a master, so I don’t need another master,” Lin Yun said. His master was the Radiant Sword Saint. The Dragon Origin Great Saint could also be considered his master, so he didn’t need alms from others.

The surroundings fell into silence as everyone was left dumbfounded by what Lin Yun said. Even the dragon lords were frightened to the point that they didn’t dare to say a word.

Gu Xiyan was also shocked, but he soon inwardly smiled because he had underestimated Ye Qingtian, believing that he wouldn’t refuse the Empress.

“I’m grateful for the Empress’ kindness, but there’s no need for me to take her as my master. But I like the reward, and I’ll thank the Empress in advance.” Lin Yun smiled. “I believe the promises made by the Empress wouldn’t be taken back, not to mention it’s announced in public. I’ll announce it to the world when I receive them.”

Everyone’s mouths were wide open to an ‘O’ shape. They were left dumbfounded by Lin Yun’s words. Not only did Lin Yun just offend the Empress, but he even wanted the rewards. Most importantly, he could wear a smile on his face when he said that.

Someone else would be frightened to death if they were in Ye Qingtian’s position, but Ye Qingtian was really arrogant.

Zi Ling was so furious that she couldn’t say a word, and she found the smile on Lin Yun’s face cheap. But there was nothing she could do about it.

Even Mu Xueling couldn’t help smiling, but it was fortunate that no one else could see her true appearance or they would be deeply shocked. Lin Yun was still the same person that she knew. She still remembered how arrogant he was back in the Heavenly Fragrance Palace.

The surrounding atmosphere was awkward. Fearing that this situation might get out of hand, Mu Xueling said, “Ye Qingtian, you’re not allowed to be rude. Since the Empress has promised you, she will naturally give you the rewards.”

She seemed to be reprimanding Lin Yun, but she was actually putting a full stop to this matter and guaranteed Lin Yun’s rewards. She continued, “The Blue Dragon Vault hasn’t been opened yet, so I can’t give you any more treasures. I also can’t give you a Heavenly Dragon Bone, but I’ll keep the Heavenly Dragon’s blood for you and give it to you in the future.”

Zi Ling was anxious when she heard that. She had been asking for the Heavenly Dragon’s blood earlier, but Mu Xueling didn’t agree to it. And yet, she actually wanted to give it to Ye Qingtian now. This was unbelievable. She knew better than anyone how precious the Heavenly Dragon’s blood was. Not only was it valuable, it was also rare. One must know that even the Divine Dragon Empire didn’t have any Heavenly Dragon’s blood.
