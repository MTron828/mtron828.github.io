Chapter 2278 - Hero Rises At Tough Times

Lin Yun and Wang Muyan stood in a confrontation on the Flame Dragon’s skull that looked like a cliff.

Wang Muyan glanced at the three fleeing holy land groups with a gentle sneer.

Lin Yun also noticed this scene, and his face changed a little.

“Lin Yun, the three holy lands have already left. Do you want to carry on fighting?” Wang Muyan asked with one brow raised as she looked at Lin Yun.

“What do they have to do with me? I just found it a pity that they fled before I could settle the scores with them,” Lin Yun smiled.

Wang Muyan couldn’t help smiling upon hearing that. As her hair began to flutter, she looked charming as she recalled the past while looking at Lin Yun. “You’re still the same as before, when you were in the Heavenly Dao Sect. You’re so arrogant even though you’re in trouble.”

Lin Yun was calm as he replied, “I never boast, and you should know that.”

Dropping her smile, Wang Muyan pridefully said, “You took three palms from me. If I didn’t hold back, you would have been heavily injured by now, even with the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.”

“How do you know I didn’t go easy on you, either?” Lin Yun smiled. He wasn’t lying since he had been dividing his attention into two to find the divine flame fragment. He might’ve taken three palms from Wang Muyan and was severely injured, but he also discovered something.

Furthermore, he didn’t use his full strength in his fight with Wang Muyan.

When he fought with Wang Muyan, he could sense two pairs of eyes on him. He didn’t need to turn around to know they were from Zhao Tianyu and the Ying River King. This was why he couldn’t go all out, since he had to be on guard against those two.

“Lin Yun, why must you take it so far?” Wang Muyan’s smile disappeared. She was genuinely furious. She purposely held back twice, but Lin Yun was being unreasonable in her eyes.

“It’s okay if you don’t want to accept my grace. Do you have to humiliate me in this way?” Wang Muyan furiously gritted.

Lin Yun sighed in his heart, and said, “You can come and give it a try if you don’t believe me.”

“As you wish!” Wang Muyan coldly snorted as she circulated her saint energy.

When she pushed her palm forth, she used the Blood Moon Divine Canon, unleashing her full strength. When she raised her head, an explosion occurred in the surrounding area from the rapid compression of air as a terrifying aura swept out.

Those less fortunate Saint Lords were sent flying away, and anyone could tell how powerful this attack was.

Lin Yun took a deep breath to ignite the Dragon’s Blood within his body and the incomplete Azure Dragon Divine Rune on his chest activated. In the next second, a thunderstorm began to rumble with heaven and earth trembling, accompanied by a dragon’s roar from within his body.

His clothes began to flutter, looking like a living divine dragon. Lightning was crackling in his eyes and a violent gale made his hair flutter in the wind.

Facing Wang Muyan’s attack, Lin Yun was fearless as he pushed his palm forth, combining the Dragon’s Blood with two sword canons. As the surrounding air began to tremble, a terrifying shockwave of energy swept out.

After a brief pause from their clash, Lin Yun and Wang Muyan continued to clash. No matter what Wang Muyan did, Lin Yun could hold his ground without moving a step.

Ten-odd moves later, Lin Yun roared as the Flame Dragon’s skeleton beneath his feet began to tremble. It was as if it had come back to life.

When Wang Muyan was pushed back with another palm, she looked at Lin Yun with shock, “H-How is this possible?!”

“I told you, I never boast,” Lin Yun replied indifferently.

“Don’t rejoice so early. I have yet to use even 30% of my strength.” Wang Muyan’s face sank. She no longer held back and a crimson radiance shone from her. Her hair began to flutter as she pushed another palm forth with an unimaginable power. She wasn’t alone but was like a crimson moon rising from a blood sea.

When Lin Yun took the palm head-on, the hovering Flame Dragon’s skull sank to the ground with a terrifying shockwave sweeping out, leaving everyone dumbfounded. The three holy lands’ saint lords turned back and could feel their scalps becoming numb. They didn’t dare to take another look at the fight. They now rejoiced in their choice of retreating because they had underestimated Wang Muyan.

“What do you have to say?” Wang Muyan hovered in the air as she pushed her palm down.

Lin Yun smiled, “Have I taken a step back?”

Wang Muyan was shocked when she heard that because Lin Yun really didn’t step back when they clashed earlier.

With a single thought, the saint aura within Lin Yun’s violet palace began to rumble as the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron flew out. As the violent energy filled his body, Lin Yun roared, “Go back!”

This palm pushed Wang Muyan back, and she took three steps back when she landed on the ground. This made her face change because she was shocked this time. For Lin Yun to force her back with his cultivation at the Quasi-Saint, this had far exceeded her expectations.

“Sun and Moon Cycle!” Wang Muyan wasn’t willing to admit defeat, so she brought out the last variation of the Dragon Sun-Moon Seal. This was a profound change that didn’t just look like the cycle of the sun and moon but manifested an actual world. Wang Muyan was the ruler of this world, and her aura began to rise with time.

Ten-odd years have passed in the blink of an eye, and Wang Muyan gave off an aura at the fourth stage of the Saint Lord.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he saw this scene because that was Time Dao. Wang Muyan seemed to have come in contact with the surface of Time Dao, which was unbelievable.

“Interesting. You have improved quickly, but it’s a pity that your opponent is me.” Lin Yun began to form seals and executed the third variation of the Dragon Sun-Moon Seal.

“Heaven and Earth Unite!” Lin Yun roared as the sun and moon sword stars within his sword sea appeared before they became engraved on him. As a golden and silver radiance shone, a robe appeared on Lin Yun after being empowered with the Dragon Sun-Moon Seal. It looked like armor decorated with golden and silver patterns, and a divine dragon had bloomed on the back.

The galaxies turned into ribbons that coiled around his arm and fluttered in the wind around him. He looked like a Sword Immortal. When Wang Muyan’s attack was about to land on him, Lin Yun merely smiled and flicked his finger.

The ribbons formed with galaxies flew out, releasing a dazzling radiance that seemed to be wanting to pierce through the sky. When he waved his hand, the ribbons fluttered as the Flame Dragon’s skull beneath his feet let out a roar, appearing to have come back to life once more.

Wang Muyan’s Dragon Sun-Moon Seal exploded as she flew off of the Flame Dragon’s skull. This scene shocked everyone within the Flame Dragon Valley.

Under everyone’s disbelief, the Flame Dragon’s skull let out a roar with Lin Yun standing on it, looking like a god of war.

“What the hell is going on?” Li Feibai opened her mouth with disbelief as she watched this scene. This was a shocking scene that she couldn’t comprehend and would probably not be able to forget in her lifetime.

“This is Flower Burial?” Many Eastern Desolation cultivators could feel their scalps going numb as they looked at this unbelievable scene.

“So, this is the real you…” Ji Zixi looked excited as she resisted the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. She was still young, and the pressure from controlling the Divine Phoenix Mirror was great. So, her forehead was already covered with sweat. But when she saw this scene, she couldn’t help but excitedly rejoice.

“Flower Burial is really breathtaking.” The heavily injured Astral River Saint Lord couldn’t help praising from the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s crowd.

“I knew it!” Qu Wushuang nearly broke into tears when he saw this scene while holding on with great difficulty. But that wasn’t all. Even the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was affected.

Ji Zixi sensed this and poured her phoenix bloodline into the Divine Phoenix Mirror. The ancient mirror manifested into a golden ocean with phoenix cries as a divine phoenix flew out. This phoenix gave off a powerful pressure that pushed the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda back.

As the suppression of time and space disappeared, everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain heaved in relief.

“Not good!” Zhao Tianyu and the Ying River King’s faces changed and could no longer be bothered with the Divine Dao Pavilion. They immediately rushed towards Wang Muyan.

Along with a huge collision, Wang Muyan fell onto one knee and threw out a mouthful of blood. She raised her head to see Lin Yun standing on the Flame Dragon’s head with shock in her eyes. It turned out that Lin Yun wasn’t lying at all.

When Lin Yun and Wang Muyan looked at each other again, Lin Yun looked down on Wang Muyan this time. This naturally made Wang Muyan furious. Just when she wanted to deal with Lin Yun, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was sent flying away, and she quickly chased after it instead.

“An opportunity!” Ji Zixi wanted to chase after Wang Muyan upon seeing this.

“Stay behind!” Zhao Tianyu arrived and hovered in the air with ancient runes appearing in his eyes. He activated the Divine Lightning Eyes and emitted a huge pressure. This contained a destructive aura that made everyone feel greatly pressured. It felt like a mountain was weighing down on them.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Flower Burial, your opponent is me!” A white-clothed figure landed in front of Lin Yun. It was the Ying River King.
