Chapter 1067 - No Matter Life or Death

Back at the palace, Lin Yun made it through his fifth soul tribulation. He ended up refining a total of twenty droplets of dew. Even though he spent a lot on his tribulation, his harvest was great. He managed to refine a total of seven Demonic Astral Flowers, which gave all five of his aura oceans three Demonic Astral Flowers.

As countless petals flew out of Lin Yun’s body, the Demonic Astral Flowers formed a sea of flowers. There were fifteen Demonic Astral Flowers that formed fifteen layers of flowers.

With fifteen layers of flowers combining together, the pressure Lin Yun was giving off had reached an unprecedented height that made his body glow. If others didn’t have a strong enough cultivation, they wouldn’t be able to see his appearance clearly.

“In terms of origin energy, I’m at least five times stronger than when I was in Wind Mound City!” said Lin Yun proudly. The surrounding space was trembling as his pupils shined brightly.

He was strong back in Wind Mound City mainly because of his sword intent and holy spirit martial intent. His cultivation didn’t impress anyone. In fact, the commonly held opinion was that Lin Yun could only compete with the Realm Sons due to his heaven-defying sword intent.

But now that he had refined twenty droplets of dew, his foundation was at least as good as the Realm Sons. After all, the effects of the dew far exceeded basking in the Saint Spiritual Lake.

Enveloped in the layers of flowers, Lin Yun began to perform the Divine Glorysun Fist and Divine Glorymoon Fist. The light coming from his punches lit up the entire plaza and created cracks on all the surrounding buildings.

“Come back!” When Lin Yun was done, he barked and retracted all the flowers into his body. Although his terrifying aura was restrained, he still looked extraordinary. He was so extraordinary that Yue Weiwei let out a sigh when she looked at him.

Lin Yun’s dangerous subjugation of the seven Demonic Astral Flowers caused her heart to throb violently. But now that Lin Yun could perfectly control the Demonic Astral Flowers, Yue Weiwei couldn’t help wearing a charming smile.

When Lin Yun was done, he took a step forward and appeared before Yue Weiwei.

“Big Brother Yun, how do you feel right now?” Yue Weiwei smiled.

“Three Demonic Astral Flowers in each of my aura oceans is the limit for me right now. I heard that the highest limit for the Heavenly Soul Realm is seven Demonic Astral Flowers,” replied Lin Yun.

“It’s rare for anyone to achieve that even in Kunlun Realm, not to mention that it requires a higher cultivation,” chuckled Yue Weiwei. “Big Brother Yun, you’re already very formidable.”

Lin Yun merely replied with a smile. Yue Weiwei’s smile was extremely charming to Lin Yun.

“Let’s go,” said Lin Yun. “It’s time for us to join the final battle.”

He didn’t say it, but it was also time for him to kill some people.

At the center of the Saint Spiritual Lake, the Realm Sons were emitting a terrifying aura as they opened their eyes. Every single one of them had reached the pinnacle fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm and they could make a breakthrough anytime they wanted to. However, each of them wisely chose to stabilize their foundation.

Thunderclouds gathered in the sky as Demonic Astral Flowers began to descend from the sky. Explosions were constantly coming from the sea of flames.

Ordinary geniuses in the fifth soul would be incinerated if they came in contact with the Demonic Astral Flowers. However, the Realm Sons were subduing the Demonic Astral Flowers. They were even integrating the Demonic Astral Flowers into their aura oceans. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It was a shocking sight for the crowd to see. They watched in silence as the Realm Sons subdued the Demonic Astral Flowers. Clearly, the Realm Sons were serious when they declared that only the Realm Sons could participate in the final battle.

Even if the other geniuses joined the final battle, they wouldn’t cause any waves. After all, the Realm Sons sealed off the Yellow Sandy Plain and humiliated countless geniuses. With this thorn in many people’s hearts, many people felt powerless.

“Aren’t they a little too strong…” Qin Lin smiled bitterly. He was unhappy with the Nether Divinity Realm Son, but there was nothing he could do. He didn’t even dare to complain anymore after witnessing the absurd tribulation. Deep down, he was hoping that Lin Yun would stay far away because the Realm Sons were much too strong for Lin Yun after the baptism of the Saint Spiritual Lake.

Similarly, no one believed they could compete with the Realm Sons.

Suddenly, the Nether Divinity Realm Son began to shine brightly after subduing another Demonic Astral Flower.

“He actually succeeded? That’s the sixth flower, right?”

“He now has ten Demonic Astral Flowers, including the four he had from the start.”

“It looks like he was really humiliated by Lin Yun. I bet he has been refining tons of treasures recently.”

“With his current strength, he could easily suppress Lin Yun now.”

“It looks like the Nether Divinity Realm Son is putting his life on the line.” The act of subduing the Demonic Astral Flowers was dangerous and everyone thought the Nether Divinity Realm Son reached his limit after subduing the fifth flower. However, he proved everyone wrong by subduing a sixth Demonic Astral Flower.

When all the radiance dissipated, the Nether Divinity Realm Son began to laugh because he knew that he had succeeded. He then swept his gaze at the other Realm Sons with pride in his eyes.

Even the Imperial Feather Realm Son swept a glance at him. But the Imperial Feather Realm Son wasn’t afraid because he had consumed a thousand year-old saint herb before entering the Saint Spiritual Lake, so he was confident about becoming the champion.

When he raised his head, he could still see LIn Yun’s name shining as the champion of the gold ranking. It was a name so dazzling that he couldn’t neglect it. After the battle in Wind Mound City, the ten Realm Sons were ranked behind him.

Although it was a rough ranking, he couldn’t accept the fact that Lin Yun’s ranking was ahead of his. It proved that Lin Yun wasn’t dead and that he was living well in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. It was embarrassing because he was the one who said that Lin Yun was dead after entering the forbidden region. “That fellow’s name is really annoying.”

The Profound Dragon and Elysium Dragon Realm Sons came over to the Nether Divinity Realm Son after they were done refining five Demonic Astral Flowers each.

“It doesn’t matter how dazzling his name is. He’s still trapped in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm,” said the Elysium Trigram Realm Son coldly.

All of them had grown twice as strong, especially the Nether Divinity Realm Son. His strength had reached an unfathomable height. In fact, it wouldn’t be a surprise if he became the champion.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son smiled coldly, “I really hope that he can come out. I didn’t have enough fun with him before he ran into the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.”

The other Realm Sons looked at the Nether Divinity Realm Son strangely. Then why didn’t he say it was fun when Lin Yun beat him up? Does he enjoy getting slapped in the face? Although the Realm Sons were thinking these thoughts, none of them said a word. After all, the final battle was imminent.

Four hours later, an aged voice sounded out once more, “Time’s up. Those who want to join the final battle can leave. Based on ancestral teachings, life and death will be of no concern in the final battle. So the moment someone admits defeat, they can’t be attacked. Make your decision wisely.”

The moment the voice sounded out, an uproar was heard on the Saint Spiritual Lake. Many people were hesitant for the final battle because they didn’t want to lose their lives if they couldn’t admit defeat in time.
