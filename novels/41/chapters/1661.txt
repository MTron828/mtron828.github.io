Chapter 1662 – When You Start To Doubt

Lin Yun slew a Saint while only at the Dragon Pulse Realm. As the saint’s blood rained, everyone still couldn’t believe that Lin Yun slew a Saint. After all, that was a Saint Lord they were talking about.

The cultivation path in the Divine Dragon Era was separated into two, the mortal dao and the saint dao. This was because one would no longer be considered a mortal after becoming a Saint. This was why there was a saying in the Kunlun Realm: Everyone beneath the Saint Realm was an ant. As long as one hadn’t become a saint, they were still considered ants, even if they were at the pinnacle Nirvana Stage.

A Nirvana Stage expert and someone at the Empyrean Realm had no difference in the eyes of a Saint. This was because a Saint was like an elephant, and those under the Saint Realm were mere ants. No matter how strong an ant could be, it could easily be crushed by elephants.

Saints cultivated the Saint Origin, grasping the saint dao and the world's laws. Their Saint Constellation could connect with heaven and earth, and just breathing alone would release boundless energy. Based on the strength the black-robed Saint Lord had shown, he could easily heavily injure the other Sword Sect’s peak masters with a wave of his hand. Those peak masters were all at the pinnacle Nirvana Stage, and some even reached the quasi-Saint Realm. But they couldn’t put up any resistance before him.

Even Tian Xuanzi was extremely shocked. As a Saint Sovereign, he naturally knew how strong Saint Lords were. Even if Lin Yun possessed a Sovereign Saint Artifact, he only thought that Lin Yun could injure the black-robed Saint Lord after summoning the Sovereign Constellation, at best. This was because Sovereign Saint Artifacts were strong, and they were only inferior to the Ten Great Divine Artifacts in the Kunlun Realm, especially since Lin Yun’s Sovereign Saint Artifact was an ancient one with a great origin.

A Great Saint with a Sovereign Saint Artifact could even face an expert at the Emperor Realm head-on, or even heavily injure them. As for killing Saint Lords, that would be even easier. But that was only for Great Saint experts. How much power could Lin Yun unleash with his cultivation at the Dragon Pulse Realm? It was impressive if he could bring out one-thousandth of the Sovereign Saint Artifact’s power. So how could he possibly slay a Saint Lord?

This was why Tian Xuanzi wasn’t worried earlier, despite feeling that something wasn’t right. The thought of a Saint Lord being slain by Lin Yun never crossed his mind because that was impossible. But what happened before him overturned that, and his smile froze.

At this moment, his face was terrifyingly dark because even if he killed Lin Yun now, he wouldn’t be able to make up for the loss of a Saint Lord, and his heart was bleeding now.

Everyone underestimated the power of the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. It was a Sovereign Saint Artifact that the Azure Dragon Lord was filled with praise for, not to mention it was an ancestral artifact of the Azure Dragon’s Lineage, a Sovereign Saint Artifact forged by the Mo Clan.

Simultaneously, they also underestimated Lil’ Purple’s Indigofrost Divine Flames. If she was in her strongest state, a tiny wisp of the Indigofrost Divine Flames could instantly incinerate a Great Saint. When the black-robed Saint Lord was caught by the Indigofrost Divine Flames, he had to exhaust a significant portion of his saint origin to suppress the flames and didn’t dare to be careless. This was because if the fire spread throughout his body, he would die, even if he had nine extra lives.

The Indigofrost Divine Flames might look ordinary, but only the black-robed Saint Lord knew how troublesome it was to deal with. Not to mention that Lil’ Purple played the flute with her ninth-grade saint tune. The Saint Lord was lucky that Lil’ Purple didn’t cultivate the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, or Lil’ Purple could have killed him with just a song.

Secondly, Lin Yun put his life at risk and undid three seals on the Profound Wither Key. He used the energy to release the third restriction on the umbrella, summoning the Azure Dragon Sovereign Constellation. So when everything came together, this became the reason why he could slay a Saint Lord.

As the blood rain continued, Lin Yun suddenly fell onto one knee, and the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella slipped from his hand. Fine cracks also appeared on his body, which was falling apart. He only persevered earlier due to his powerful will and determination to kill the black-robed Saint Lord. Now that the black-robed Saint Lord died, he finally relaxed, which meant that the energy initially suppressed within his body was going berserk.

After withdrawing the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, Lil’ Purple quickly came over to Lin Yun.

“I won’t be dying anytime soon.” Lin Yun squeezed out a smile.

But Lil’ Purple said indifferently, “Sit down.”

Nodding his head, Lin Yun sat down and Lil’ Purple poured her origin energy into his body. In the next moment, she saw the horrendous state of Lin Yun’s injuries. His internal organs were damaged, fine cracks were covering his skeleton, his heart was bleeding, his blood was like blazing magma, and the dragon origin ocean within his violet palace had dried up. The Netherflower within his violet palace had also withered, and it could no longer suppress the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron.

He had undone three seals of the Profound Wither Key, allowing the energy to overlap within his body before he could digest the previous one. Thus, after being stacked threefold, the power naturally reached a terrifying height, and it wasn’t something that Lin Yun’s body could contain.

Lin Yun’s body was like a withered tree at this moment, and his body would collapse soon enough. This was because Lin Yun’s life source had suffered a heavy blow, and it was like a candle that would blow out at any time. Aside from his brain and the Blue Dragon Bone, there wasn’t a single thing within his body that was complete. But the Blue Dragon Bone had become silent since it was over-exhausted from the battle.

Seeing this scene, Lil’ Purple took a deep breath because not even a deity could save Lin Yun now. His physique had already gone to waste, nearly making Lil’ Purple faint; her hands and lips were trembling as she stood behind Lin Yun.

“You scumbag…” Tears rolled down Lil’ Purple’s cheeks as she became overwhelmed by her sorrow and pain. Her heart was swept with loneliness, and her heart had died.

“Inject your phoenix origin into the Blue Dragon Bone. The Azure Dragon Lord gave me a droplet of the Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood. So I won’t be dying anytime soon.” Lin Yun’s voice resounded right at this moment.

Lil’ Purple was briefly stunned before her tears streamed down, and she yelled, “Why didn’t you tell me earlier, you bastard!”

“Alright, alright. Stop crying. Don’t forget that you’re a phoenix. Hurry up. I don’t think the sect master will be able to stop Tian Xuanzi.” Lin Yun said.

“Yeah.” Lil’ Purple nodded and quickly poured her phoenix origin into Lin Yun’s Blue Dragon Bone. When her phoenix origin was being poured into the Blue Dragon Bone, she noticed that there was a massive world within the bone forged with ancient runes. Those were Origin Divine Runes, but they were dim now, with a droplet of blue liquid glowing in the center.

When Lil’ Purple found it, she quickly injected her phoenix origin into the Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood. As time passed, boundless vitality swept out from the Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood, and it didn’t take long for those divine runes to gradually recover along with the Blue Dragon Bone.

When the Blue Dragon Bone recovered, Lin Yun’s body was like a new sapling with a new life being born. This process was slow, but this also meant that he would live. At this moment, Lil’ Purple didn’t even have to do anything. His body would gradually restore itself.

“If I wasn’t around…” Lil’ Purple grumbled with her eyes reddening, while letting out a sob. But she couldn’t say the word ‘death.’ After all, not everyone possessed phoenix origin, and not everyone could come over to his side so quickly. If she had been slightly slower, Lin Yun would’ve died.

Turning around, Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple and said, “I wouldn’t have done this if you were not here. I dare to do what I did because I knew you were around.”

Lil’ Purple was briefly stunned when she heard what Lin Yun said. She soon looked baffled because she had never been trusted in this manner in the past hundred thousand years of her life. “Why…?”

“That’s because you’re a phoenix…” Lin Yun caressed her head and continued, “You’re the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths. I still remember it well.”

“You always said that I’m just bragging!” Lil’ Purple argued.

Facing Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun could only smile. After all, he still felt that Lil’ Purple was bragging.

Raising her head to look at the five Saint Sovereigns who were still fighting, Lil’ Purple said, “Let’s go. There are no Saint Lords around to stop you from leaving now.”

“I still can’t leave…” Lin Yun shook his head and slowly stood up. “Let’s not mention that I’m the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint. I can’t leave since I’m the cause of this battle. I have an ill premonition. You know I have the Firmament Saint Cloth, and I can’t leave if Tian Xuanzi is coming after my master.”

Moreover, he didn’t think that he could leave now. If he left, what would happen to his fellow martial siblings? God knows what Tian Xuanzi would do at that time.

“But what if your master doesn’t come?” Lil’ Purple said after a brief hesitation. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun looked at her, but Lil’ Purple didn’t avoid his gaze. Her heart was small, and she could only contain one person.

Looking at Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun said, “Regardless of any relationship in this world, be it love, friendship, or master and disciple, you have already lost the moment you doubted the relationship. Like I don’t doubt you’ll come, I also believe in my master. If you can’t make it, you must be trapped on the Myriad Demon Peak, and I believe my master has a reason if he can’t make it over. If that’s the case, that’s more of a reason as to why I can’t leave. If Tian Xuanzi is coming after my master, I’ll just take it on his behalf, then.”

Lil’ Purple’s heart trembled, and she finally understood something after seeing Lin Yun’s pupils. She knew why Lin Yun could make it out of the Ninth Heavenly Path, why he could be taken as a disciple by the Radiant Sword Saint, why Su Ziyao would spend a year staying with him at the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and why Yue Weiwei would give him the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute.

“Okay. We’ll stay, then.” Lil’ Purple nodded.

Turning around, Lin Yun looked at the battle of the five Saint Sovereigns. The death of a Saint Lord made Tian Xuanzi lose his composure and started going berserk, but the four Saint Sovereigns still blocked his attacks.

The Heavenly Note Sect’s sect master was playing a saint tune, and the Profound Valley’s valley master created a Sovereign Saint Diagram with divine runes. At the same time, Mu Xuankong and Chen Yu swung their weapons, unleashing their blade and sword intents to the limit. The four Saint Sovereigns didn’t hold back and did everything they could to block Tian Xuanzi’s attacks.

“Tian Xuanzi, give up!” The Profound Valley’s valley master said. “With your talent, who can be your opponent after a hundred years? We might not be able to defeat you, but you also won’t be able to capture Lin Yun with us around!”

The other three Saint Sovereigns stared at Tian Xuanzi. They could feel immense pressure from the latter. They were shocked by Tian Xuanzi’s strength earlier. Tian Xuanzi was stronger than them, despite being a Saint Sovereign.

“Give up? Ha…” Tian Xuanzi’s eyes flashed with mockery, and the purple flower on his shoulder suddenly flew into the sky. As a floral fragrance spread out, everyone saw that each petal had a divine rune engraved on it, and a certain seal on Tian Xuanzi was lifted when the flower broke apart. As the aura that Tian Xuanzi gave off became increasingly terrifying, this shocked the four Saint Sovereigns because Tian Xuanzi’s aura had surpassed that of a Saint Sovereign.

“You’re not a Saint Sovereign…” The Profound Valley’s valley master exclaimed.

“Saint Sovereign? I was already no longer one a long time ago.” Tian Xuanzi smiled as he caught onto a flower petal. Flicking it away, Tian Xuanzi’s face suddenly became cold, and he roared, “I’m now the Profound Sky Great Saint!”
