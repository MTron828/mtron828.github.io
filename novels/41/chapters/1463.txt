Chapter 1464 - Temper

“Lin Yun, do you accept this?” Mu Xuankong looked at Lin Yun amicably. “You can speak if you have any opinions.”

Lin Yun could hear that there was room for negotiation. The other peak masters, as well as all the disciples, turned their gazes over. Even those in the top ten of the Earth Ranking were stunned when they heard that, especially Huangfu Yan. His face had changed multiple times within this amount of short time.

“I have none. Since I’m late, I’ll accept my punishment.” Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled and sat down on the stage. It wasn’t his intention to be late, but he didn’t know how long it would take to make a breakthrough in his firmament sword intent, nor was he entirely confident in it. But late was late, and there was nothing to argue about. Even if he couldn’t make it into the top ten, Lin Yun wouldn’t blame anyone for it.

“Since that’s the case, fellow Junior Brothers, let’s undo the seal.” Mu Xuankong withdrew his gaze. Sword rays then shone from his body. The other peak masters quickly formed seals and the sea of clouds beneath them slowly expanded like a mirror.

“Let’s begin!” Mu Xuankong’s voice resounded with everyone on the stage flying towards the entrance. Those in the top ten had all entered in the blink of an eye.

When the sea of clouds opened up, a small cliff appeared before everyone with countless figures diving down like meteorites, shining with sword rays.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he thought he was looking at another world. But the strange factor was that he could see everything clearly, as if space had overlapped. This feeling couldn’t be described in words, and this made him wonder if it was because of the sword intent left behind by Yu Qingfeng three thousand years ago.

This made Lin Yun fall into deep thoughts, curious about how special that sword ray was. While he was deep in his thoughts, two people slowly walked over. It was Gongsun Yan and Chen Ling.

Lin Yun nodded to them with a smile, looking pretty relaxed.

“Senior Brother seems to be in a good mood, even though you’re being restrained for an hour.” This made Chen Ling feel a headache. Lin Yun was restricted for an hour, which meant that he would have nothing to do with the top ten. After all, many things could be done in an hour.

“Tell him the reward of this competition, and he won’t smile anymore.” Gongsun Yan said with a playful smile.

“What reward?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he heard what Gongsun Yan said. He was now broke after using up all his resources during his seclusion. He was so broke that he had to hunt demonic beasts to make a breakthrough in his cultivation, and it was pretty painful for him.

“The reward for the champion is the Dragon-Blooded Crystal. It’s on the same level as your Divine Golden Crow Iron. Those in the top ten will also receive a tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead. Furthermore, those are just the additional rewards…” Chen Ling explained to Lin Yun and even told him the rules of the Five Peaks Competition.

After Lin Yun listened to the rules, he slightly furrowed his brows because the rules were pretty troublesome. If the rankings were determined based on the quality and quantity of the Azure Lotus Sword Flowers that were gathered, he would be immediately eliminated since he was being restricted for an hour.

“You two can go ahead first. Don’t fall behind. Try and get into the top ten since the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead is a great treasure.” Lin Yun had refined a tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead, and the value was more significant than others could imagine.

After Gongsun Yan and Chen Ling left, the Celestial Observing Stage became empty. There wasn’t anyone else left, aside from deacons and Dragon Pulse Realm disciples. This made Lin Yun bored, so he looked at the burning incense.

Time was passing really slowly, and Lin Yun started to become restless after he heard the rewards from Chen Ling. Even if he had no idea what the Dragon-Blooded Crystal was, the name itself was enough to tell it was a treasure!

Both Mu Qingqing and Mu Xueqin were outside the Celestial Observing Stage with surprised looks on their faces. Since Mu Qingqing was hoping that Lin Yun could shock her elder sister again, she couldn’t help wearing an awkward expression, and pouted, “Our father is a baddie! Lin Yun made it in time, but he insists on restricting him for an hour!”

But Mu Xueqin didn’t say a word to Mu Qingqing. Her gaze was fixed on Lin Yun, falling into deep thoughts.

“Big Sister, you can stop watching now. I’m sorry to have wasted your time.” Mu Qingqing weakly said. “There’s no competition for Lin Yun now that he’s being restricted for an hour…”

Mu Xueqin still didn’t speak as she glared at Lin Yun. It was as though she was looking at a precious sword as her gaze became glued to him.

“Big Sister, what’s wrong with you? I’m talking to you…” Mu Qingqing became furious and furrowed her brows, seeing that she was ignored. She was unhappy at the fact that Lin Yun had to be restricted for an hour.

She stood before Mu Xueqin, blocking her elder sister’s gaze, which made Mu Xueqin unhappy. She said, “Get lost. You’re blocking me.”

Mu Qingqing was stumped when she heard that and had no idea why her elder sister was staring at Lin Yun. More importantly, her elder sister actually told her to get lost? This instantly made Mu Qingqing filled with grievances as she muttered, “Why are you yelling at me…?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Why are you always in the way?” Mu Xueqin’s eyes flashed with displeasure and quickly overtook Mu Qingqing. But when she raised her head, Lin Yun was nowhere to be found, since an hour had passed. Mu Xueqin raised her brow before she flew to the Celestial Observing Stage.

She quickened her footsteps and came to the edge of the Celestial Observing Stage, before looking down. She could see an azure figure rapidly descending in the form of golden light.

“Senior Sister Mu!” The remaining Dragon Pulse Realm disciples on the stage were shocked when they saw Mu Xueqin. They didn’t hesitate to step forth and greet her. After all, Mu Xueqin was ranked third on the Heaven Ranking, and she had high prestige in the sect.

Mu Xueqin casually responded to them, her eyes still glued to Lin Yun. This made bellowing waves in the hearts of the surrounding Dragon Pulse Realm disciples. They were surprised that Mu Xueqin would come to watch the Five Peaks Competition, and she seemed concerned about Lin Yun.

This made them shocked and they wondered how strong Lin Yun had become. In their impression, Mu Xueqin had always been indifferent, even towards Gu Ruochen, who was first on the Heaven Ranking.

“Xueqin is also here?” The five peak masters naturally noticed Mu Xueqin.

“That lass might be able to see something. But she probably won’t be able to see much with her eyesight.” Mu Xuankong smiled.

“What do you mean?” The faces of the four peak masters changed because they could tell that there was a hidden meaning behind Mu Xuankong’s words.

When their gazes fell onto Lin Yun, they noticed that he had already descended towards the Celestial Observing Lake. Since that region had Yu Qingfeng’s sword aura, they couldn’t get a closer examination of Lin Yun.

“Don’t tell me that brat can turn the tables around? I don’t believe he can make it into the top ten after being restricted for an hour.” The Golden Firmament Peak’s peak master said, insisting on his view.

“I also don’t believe it. The gap of an hour is too huge, and I don’t think he can make it into the top ten as well…” The Azure Firmament Peak’s peak master said with a weird expression.

“I also don’t think he can make it into the top ten.” Mu Chuan smiled while rubbing his head. He didn’t hold much hope that Lin Yun could make it into the top ten.

“Senior Brother, stop keeping us in suspense. What did you discover?” The Indigo Firmament Peak’s peak master asked, looking at Mu Xuankong. All the peak masters regretted that they didn’t get a closer look at Lin Yun.

But Mu Xuankong simply smiled and said nothing. His four junior brothers’ views of Lin Yun was rather conservative. Then again, Mu Xuankong didn’t think he could become the champion with Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan. But it shouldn’t be an issue for Lin Yun to make it into the top ten. After all, Lin Yun had previously defeated Huangfu Yan without summoning his constellation.

“According to logic, it should be impossible for him to make it into the top ten. But it’s not impossible according to the rules.” Mu Xuankong smiled. His words changed the other peak masters’ faces as they briefly pondered over what Mu Xuankong said before their faces changed.

Even Mu Chuan took a deep breath and bitterly smiled. “Senior Brother, you really dare to think that! Even I don’t dare to think about that possibility!”

The peak master of the Golden Firmament Peak said, “According to what I know, he didn’t pick a ghost spirit martial technique!”

His words made the faces of the other peak masters change. If Lin Yun didn’t even cultivate a ghost spirit martial technique, how could he face those in the top ten on the Earth Ranking?

Mu Chuan was briefly stunned before he replied, “I think he only picked a sword sutra and no sword technique.”

But Mu Xuankong was calm as he said, “Let’s just wait and see what happens, then. I can only say that anything is possible in this Five Peaks Competition.”

Since Mu Xuankong refused to reveal anything, the four peak masters’ faces were ugly, with curiosity scratching their hearts. They all wanted to know Lin Yun’s trump card and why Mu Xuankong was confident in him.

But thinking about it again, it didn’t seem likely to be the case. After all, Lin Yun didn’t practice any ghost spirit martial techniques, and he was restricted for an hour. As for his sword sutra, he would only have reached the third stage, at best. As for his cultivation, he was only at the two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. So how could he compete with those in the top ten?

“I don’t believe it. If that kid can make it into the top ten, then I’ll drink all the water in the Celestial Observing Lake!” Said the Azure Firmament Peak’s peak master, Huangfu Jue. His temper was similar to Huangfu Yan. So his temper appeared when Mu Xuankong wasn’t willing to share anything with them.
