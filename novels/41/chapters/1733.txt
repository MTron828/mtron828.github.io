Chapter 1734 – Senior Brother, Times Have Changed!

Many people couldn’t help feeling shocked when they looked at Li Yuxi. Even the pavilion master had heard of his name, so it appeared that Li Yuxi came with confidence to the Nirvana Banquet. Not to mention that he was a genius of a holy land. So who could possibly stop him?

The pavilion master continued, “Those who can enter the top hundred during this banquet can observe the Primordial Myriad Dragon Diagram, rewarded with ten Profound Saint Pellets and fifty Dragon Saint Pellets. Those who can enter the top thirty can pick an ancient score within the Heavenly Nirvana Treasury and be rewarded with thirty Profound Saint Pellets. Those who can enter the top fifteen will be additionally rewarded with a hundred Profound Saint Pellets, ten Three-Lives Leaves, and you can pick a myriad saint artifact in the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion along with taking a master.”

The pavilion master’s words caused an uproar because the rewards were far beyond everyone’s imagination. It was no wonder why the holy land’s geniuses couldn’t help coming. Not even the holy lands could take out so many resources.

“Those in the top five will obtain three Three-Lives Flowers, and the champion will obtain three saint fruits. At the same time, they can make a request to me, and I will fulfill it as long as it’s within my abilities.”

This time, even the holy land’s elders smiled. Although the reward was generous, the holy lands could also provide resources. But there was only one Three-Lives Tree in the world, and it was in the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion. Divine trees were so rare that not even the holy lands had one.

“The reward is really generous.” Lin Yun looked at the pavilion master.

“Have you discovered anything so far?” Yue Weiwei smiled, looking at Lin Yun.

“Nothing.” Lin Yun shook his head. He knew Yue Weiwei was definitely asking if he discovered if the Heavenly Nirvana Banquet had any connection with the Azure Dragon’s lineage.

“Where’s the Three-Lives Tree?” Lin Yun looked around, but couldn’t find it anywhere. Logically speaking, the Three-Lives Tree should be majestic as a divine tree and be discovered long ago.

“Perhaps we’ve already found it but didn’t realize it.” Yue Weiwei.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that.

“Alright. Aside from those who were invited, everyone else can leave.” The pavilion master said. Very quickly, only those participating in the banquet were left in the surroundings as the other guests returned to their seats.

With that, the Nirvana Banquet had officially begun. Several elders from the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion landed on the stage, each facing a different direction. Multiple white jades were hovering before them, and the jades recorded the names of all participating musicians. There were over ten thousand jade slips, and they each emitted a faint radiance.

“The rules of this Nirvana Banquet will be different this time. It will be separated into three rounds. In the first round, a hundred people will face off on a stage at once, and the five who stood out will proceed to the next round. Five people will face off at once in the second round, and one will stand out. As for the final round, the remaining hundred people will face off to be ranked.” Since there were too many musicians at this banquet, the rules naturally had to change, and they had to end it quickly.

This banquet was brutal because only the strong would stand till the end. Everyone became nervous when the rules were announced, and the elders soon called out names. A person would go on the stage whenever the elders called out a name.

It didn’t take long for the stage to be filled with people and become chaotic. A battle soon broke out on the stage when a hundred names were called.

Various music echoed from the stage, and everyone’s gazes were on it. This included Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei, who were seriously observing the stage. All the musicians qualified to participate in the banquet were geniuses, and none were weak. Furthermore, a battle in music dao was a lot more intense than martial dao.

In a chaotic battle between a hundred people, aside from pure strength, one also needed some skills. If they didn’t know how to conceal themselves well, they would easily be sieged by everyone. Very quickly, only five people standing on the stage were qualified to make it into the next round.

“Yan Tianchen!” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s chief disciple was soon called out. Before him, Lin Wan and everyone else was eliminated. Only Yan Tianchen, Lin Yun, and Yue Weiwei were left.

“I’ll get going now.” Yan Tianchen smiled at Lin Yun, and he went on the stage. He was insignificant on the stage. The most dazzling one amongst these hundred people was Di Qiu.

Di Qiu was a genius of the Seven Exquisite Palace, grasping the Great Saint Tone at the age of twenty. He was a peerless genius in music dao. To grasp the Great Saint Tone at such a young age, he could be ranked in the top three in terms of talent in the Seven Exquisite Palace for the past thousand years. This alone was enough to show how strong his talent was.

As for Yan Tianchen, he didn’t have much of a reputation aside from being the chief disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. On the other hand, Di Qiu was arrogant and didn’t know how to keep a low profile. So he instantly became the focus of attention the moment he appeared.

“Di Qiu is on the stage!”

“Tsk, tsk. I’m afraid the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion will be eliminated now.”

“Yan Tianchen is really unlucky. If he ran into someone else, it shouldn’t be an issue for him to make it into the next stage with his strength.” Everyone said. They weren’t optimistic about Yan Tianchen. They only felt that Yan Tianchen would become Di Qiu’s stepping stone.

When Lin Yun heard the surrounding discussions, he roughly knew what kind of person Di Qiu was, and a smile rose on his lips. After all, Yan Tianchen crawled out of the divine mountain’s Blood Purgatory. As for him becoming someone’s stepping stone? Who were they kidding?

On the Nirvana Stage, everyone’s attention was on Di Qiu, and they saw Di Qiu retrieving a flute before he started to play it. The flute music was piercing, and the musical notes were bizarre; it sounded terrible.

It sounded like the shrieks of demonic beasts and the howls of ghosts. There was nothing more torturing than this, and many people threw out a mouthful of blood on the spot. Some of them even painfully held onto their heads and screamed on the ground.

What was even more bizarre was that their painful screams fused into Di Qiu’s music. This only made his music dao even more terrifying. Some could resist it, but they began to struggle when the screams merged with Di Qiu’s music.

“What the hell is this music?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Can this be considered music dao?”

“How ignorant. This is the Seven Mourn Demonic Score of the Seven Exquisite Palace. It can play the most painful music in the world. Qi Diu’s control in music has reached a terrifying height, and his mental cultivation is so strong at such a young age.” Everyone was shocked before they wore an expression as though they had already expected this scene. Most of the people who remained wanted to join forces to deal with Di Qiu, but their faces were distorted with pain when they got close.

“That’s enough.” The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s elders said when only five people were standing. He wanted to stop Di Qiu, but the latter had no intention of stopping and continued to play his song.

“He’s not going to stop if the song doesn’t end.” Everyone was shocked and quickly realized that Di Qiu wanted to suppress everyone on the stage. This further showed how arrogant Di Qiu was.

The Heavenly Nirvana Banquet’s elders turned to look at the pavilion master, and the latter nodded his head. The pavilion master loves geniuses and wouldn’t mind giving them an exemption. When most of the remaining people got seven feet away from Di Qiu, they suddenly bled from their seven orifices before falling to the ground. Their faces were distorted as though they were in great pain, and Di Qiu was the only one standing.

“It has come to an end.” Just when everyone felt that this had ended, they were surprised to see someone calmly seated on the stage. This person was Yan Tianchen of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. It turned out that he was still around, and this shocked many people because Yan Tianchen actually managed to endure for so long.

“Senior Brother Yan, you’re still not going to admit defeat?” Di Qiu continued with his music. They were disciples of the Four Musical Houses, so there was no problem with Di Qiu addressing Yan Tianchen as ‘Senior Brother,’ and it could be considered a respectful form of address. But for some reason, it sounded weird to others because it felt like mockery to everyone.

“It’s not bad. I don’t mind listening.” Yan Tianchen said.

“Haha. Do you think I didn’t notice you? If you don’t want to admit defeat with dignity, don’t blame me for embarrassing the chief disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, then.” Di Qiu mocked. He didn’t have much respect for Yan Tianchen, who was the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s chief disciple.

The flute music suddenly became unfathomable, and the terrible music also became sharp to the ears. Everyone who listened to it felt like their eardrums were about to burst.

Suddenly, phenomena began to appear, and the crimson miasma from the flute music manifested into various ominous beasts. At this moment, it seemed his flute music had become demonic, and the seven beasts were ugly and sinister. When those beasts released a despairing howl, it placed everyone in fear.

“Senior Brother Yan, the times have changed. There is no longer a spot for the old generation like you, and there was no spot for you in Heavenly Domain City long ago.” Di Qiu wore a sinister smile, and the seven ominous beasts charged forth, wanting to devour Yan Tianchen.

Yan Tianchen’s expression was calm as he fell into deep thoughts while looking at the ominous beasts.

“Haha. Senior Brother, are you still not going to use your musical instrument? Just surrender. There’s no meaning in…” Di Qiu mocked.

But before he could finish, Yan Tianchen reached out and grabbed onto a leaf. “I don’t need my musical instrument to deal with someone like you.”

The leaf was something he casually took from beneath the stage. When everyone was puzzled, Yan Tianchen said, “You’ve never seen purgatory before. So you’re too naive to think you can play the genuine demonic music. Let me show you the true meaning of demonic music, the true meaning of despair.”

When he was done, Yan Tianchen placed the leaf by his lips and played piercing music. As a terrifying demonic light exploded from Yan Tianchen, his pupils became scarlet, and crimson veins began to climb on his face. His face also became sinister, and his pupils flickered with demonic radiance as if he was saying he was the demon, and Di Qiu knew nothing about demonic music.

At this moment, Yan Tianchen exploded with torrential rage. Di Qiu’s music was broken the next moment, and the seven ominous beasts were reduced to crimson mist.

Throwing out a mouthful of blood, Di Qiu took three steps back before he fell onto one knee with two droplets of blood dripping from his eyes. He knew that he had already lost.

Everyone looked at Yan Tianchen in disbelief, and their pupils were shocked. This was especially the case for those who belonged to the Seven Exquisite Palace.
