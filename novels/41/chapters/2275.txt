Chapter 2276 - Enemies, Not Friends

Wang Muyan sounded domineering, causing the faces of the three Saint Lords to change. This was a piece of hidden history, and what Wang Muyan said was true. Logically speaking, the Kunlun Realm was chaotic before the Divine Dragon Empire had been established and the Nine Emperors rose to fame.

Three thousand years ago, the Blood Moon Sect was an immortal holy land, and their sect master was the Blood Monarch, someone who was endlessly close to being a deity. It wasn’t an underestimation to say that he possessed the strength to rival a deity.

Even when the Nine Emperors rose to fame, the Southern Emperor, the strongest amongst the nine, couldn’t kill the Blood Monarch. Back then, the Heavenly Dao sect also had forces throughout the Kunlun Realm, and even the Divine Phoenix Mountain was under the jurisdiction of the Blood Moon Sect’s territory.

That was a dark history of all holy lands, who had no choice but to bow to the Blood Moon Sect to survive. When the Blood Moon Sect was destroyed, they didn’t have many Saints left.

“What an arrogant tone. You guys are just a bunch of rats down the drain. I will eradicate you guys today!” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord came to his senses as a sun and a moon appeared in his eyes with a Yin-Yang diagram beneath him and a starry sky behind him.

The Sun-Moon Sacred Cauldron released a powerful force before charging towards Wang Muyan. The Crow Shot Saint Lord flapped his wings as he charged with the golden axe. The Indigo Brave Saint Lord drew his blade, unleashing a blade ray towards Wang Muyan.

Wang Muyan was calm as she gently pointed her finger at the blade ray. When a time seal bloomed on her finger, the blade was dragged into time, constantly being devoured. But that wasn’t all, when Wang Muyan joined her hands, a space seal appeared.

Spatial fluctuation spread out as the Sun-Moon Sacred Cauldron collided with the ripples and couldn’t take another step forward. It was as though it had sunken into a quagmire. Wang Muyan then tapped her feet on the ground and left behind an afterimage, avoiding the incoming golden axe.

The Crow Shot Saint Lord had executed a dragon spirit martial technique with the golden axe. Each of his attacks was terrifying, with a radiance sweeping throughout the Flame Dragon Valley. But relying on the time-space domain from the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, Wang Muyan easily dealt with the incoming attacks from the three Saint Lords by using the time and space seals.

The three Saint Lords attacked, but Wang Mayan easily resolved all their attacks, and this shocking scene made everyone’s scalps go numb.

“Mhm? Why did the Divine Dao Pavilion return?” Li Feibai suddenly spoke out.

When Lin Yun and Ji Zixi turned their heads over, they saw the Divine Dao Pavilion’s party returning in a pathetic state at the edge of the Flame Dragon Valley. Before they came to their senses, multiple figures soared into the sky around the Flame Dragon Valley, each giving off a demonic aura. They looked like a swarm of locusts as they flew over.

“Those are Saint Realm demonic corpses!” The faces of everyone within the Flame Dragon Valley changed. A Saint Realm demonic corpse wasn’t terrifying because every Saint here could easily face ten by themselves. But there were too many of them. There were at least a few thousand demonic corpses flying over.

“H-How is this possible?!”`

“Where did they get so many demonic corpses from? Did they dig up the entire Heavenly Void?”

“Isn’t this a little too unbelievable?” Everyone was dumbfounded.

Lin Yun frowned, but he wasn’t concerned by the numbers. The Asura Dove King once told him that demonic corpses varied in strength, and most demonic corpses only looked terrifying.

He only needed to be afraid of those demonic corpses that had intelligence since those demonic corpses would possess martial techniques from when they were still alive. At first glance, it was easy to differentiate the demonic corpses from their eyes.

“The Demonspirit Clan is giving it their all,” Lin Yun muttered. Bringing so many demonic corpses must’ve exhausted quite a bit of the Demonspirit Clan’s foundation. Even if they won this fight, they would lose at least seventy percent of their demonic corpses.

Li Feibai shook his head, “They’re all dead, and that’s nothing. The thing worth noting is refining living people into demonic corpses. I now understand that the divine flame fragment was only the bait used to lure all the Saints in the Eastern Desolation over.”

They wanted the divine flame fragment and all the Saints present.

Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto the Divine Dao Pavilion’s party. The demonic corpses didn’t force them back, but the Blood Moon Sect and the Demonspirit Clan did. Zhao Tianyu and the Ying River King looked at the panic on everyone’s faces with cruel smiles.

“If it was somewhere else, killing so many Saints would be unimaginable. Your plan is flawless,” the Ying River King said with reverence.

But Zhao Tianyu said nothing as his gaze fell onto Wang Muyan, who was facing the three saint lords.

Wang Muyan was laughing as she raised her hands to the sky and dragged the three Saint Lords into the time-space domain created by the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

“Time is the sovereign while space is the king. With the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, I am invincible!” Wang Muyan waved her hands down and a massive pressure spread out.

When the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda descended, the three Saint Lords felt as though the sky had fallen with a wave of her hand, disrupting time and space.

This was a shocking scene because the three Saint Lords were being crushed before they could even respond. They threw out mouthfuls of blood and were sent flying away.

But that wasn’t all. Wang Muyan laughed while clasping her hands and a crimson moon bloomed within her eyes. “All of you can stay here!”

As the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda revolved, it started to suppress the three Saint Lords.

“Not good! She’s trying to suppress us!” The three Saint Lords’ faces changed as they tried to withstand the pressure, despite the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda continuing to fall.

On the other hand, Wang Muyan looked relaxed in comparison to the three Saint Lords.

Everyone in the Flame Dragon Valley was shocked by this scene because demonic corpses were surrounding them. Not to mention that Zhao Toanyu and the Ying River King were around. With the three Saint Lords being heavily injured, how could they get out of this situation?

As despair enveloped everyone’s hearts, Wang Muyan swept her gaze around before it fell onto the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s location. She had been paying attention to the Divine Phoenix Mirror. Aside from that, there was also someone she wanted to see. She could only see the Divine Phoenix Mirror hovering in the sky, resisting the pressure from the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, but did nothing else.

Time to face that little princess. Wang Muyan pondered before she waved her hand, sending the three Saint Lords flying away before redirecting the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda towards the Divine Phoenix Mountain group. She was more interested in the Divine Phoenix Mirror than the other three Sovereign Saint Artifacts.

“Spread out!” Ji Zixi’s face changed as she controlled the Divine Phoenix Mirror to withstand the incoming Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. As the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda descended, Ji Zixi kept retreating with everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain, spreading fire into the Divine Phoenix Mirror. Even so, the Divine Phoenix Mirror could barely withstand the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda’s pressure.

“It looks like there’s nothing impressive about the Divine Phoenix Mirror,” Wang Muyan smiled. Just when she wanted to step forth, a sword ray reached her, forcing her to take a few steps back. When she raised her head, she noticed that the sword ray had come from Lin Yun, which she had expected.

“Ye Qingtian, we meet again,” Wang Muyan smiled as if she was greeting an old friend. Back when they were still in the Heavenly Dao Sect, she was the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, while Lin Yun was the chief disciple of the Indigothunder Peak.

“It has been a long time,” Lin Yun calmly waved his hand.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Li Feibai was shocked as she watched his scene. She had long retreated to the side when chaos ensued. But she was shocked that Lin Yun also had a connection with the Blood Moon Divine Maiden.

But she soon noticed something unusual. The atmosphere between them was peculiar; they were on guard against each other, and a fight might break out at any moment.

Wang Muyan sighed, “Senior Brother Ye, you’re still as cold as before. I miss the times when we had cultivated together within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.”

Both parties have been on guard against each other and fought several times back in the Heavenly Dao Sect. They only looked like friends when cultivating within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

“There’s no need to mention the past. After the ninth, we were no longer a martial brother and sister. You’re Wang Muyan of the Blood Moon Sect, while I’m Flower Burial Lin Yun,” Lin Yun said as he tried to think of a solution.

Wang Muyan had become unfathomable just by seeing how she fought the three Saint Lords. Even when she didn’t have the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda before, she easily snatched the divine flame fragment and inflicted heavy injuries on the Astral River Saint Lord. She was no longer the same person she was once before.

“Do you think that you can stop me?” Wang Muyan raised her brow, then smiled, “You’re a smart person. You must’ve guessed I’m confident since I didn’t leave even after obtaining the divine flame fragment, right?”

When she finished speaking, the smile on her face disappeared as she stepped forth.

Lin Yun also took a step forward as he began to form seals with his hands.

Lin Yun and Wang Muyan were forming identical seals. When they raised their heads, they looked at each other with surprise beforethey executed the Dragon Sun-Moon Seal.
