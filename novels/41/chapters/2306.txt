Chapter 2307 - Who Taught You?!

Something was wrong because the holy master called him Flower Burial Sword Saint yesterday, but called him Flower Burial today.

“Don’t be afraid. I’ve taught you for a long time, so use that to give that old man a beating!” Lil’ Purple said confidently.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched because she wasn’t the one who would be receiving the beating. He executed his movement technique and came before the holy master, but the ashes attracted his attention.

“Don’t look. It doesn’t belong to you yet,” the holy master wore an ‘amicable’ smile.

Lin Yun recollected his gaze and nodded with a smile.

“Same old rules. You attack me first before I attack you,” the holy master said.

“Okay.” Lin Yun bowed and made his move on the spot.

The holy master calmly spread his sleeves, using yesterday's technique.

This naturally brought a smile to Lin Yun’s face because he had practiced this with Lil’ Purple and had already found a way to resolve it. He drew out the Flower Burial Sword and performed the Withered Tree Coming To Life. The flowing river could be heard with Lin Yun’s sword aura rising.

When Lin Yun’s Divine Light Sword Intent reached greater mastery, the power of the Withered Tree Coming To Life reached a terrifying height, while the holy master drew circles with his hands again.

This was a good opportunity for Lin Yun. Just when he wanted to resolve this move, the holy master’s move changed with his sleeves coming together and Lin Yun felt that he was compressed by the space on two sides.

This surprised Lin Yun and he was caught in it with various phenomena disappearing.

“You want to change your move? You still have to train before me.” The holy master was experienced and was known to be the strongest beneath the Emperor Realm for a long time. Lin Yun was feeling all of the grievances that the holy master wanted to vent.

As space exploded with flames gushing around, Lin Yun threw out a mouthful of blood and took several steps back, looking at the holy master with shock because today's fight differed from yesterday.

“Holy shit, there’s murderous intent in him. He’s ruthless. Lin Yun, why don’t you admit defeat?” Lil’ Purple said.

But Lin Yun’s fighting spirits were ignited as he wiped the blood off his lips and stood back up, charging again.

The holy master smiled and easily resolved Lin Yun’s attacks, drawing circles before collapsing them. Time would randomly speed up and slow down, making Lin Yun feel as though he was in a swamp. While Lin Yun performed the Divine Firefly Sword, he was sent flying away multiple times and began to doubt himself.

“It looks like I don’t even have the opportunity to make a move today. You should go and train before coming back. Your flaws are too obvious, and you will lose when your sword intent can’t obtain the advantage in the fight. You’re still lacking,” the holy master smiled.

“I’m not done yet. Take another sword from me!” Lin Yun smiled as he performed the Divine Firefly Sword's third section, Blooming Stars.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

With a flick of his wrist, it looked like a hundred flowers were blooming, each containing a different saint dao. This attack was powerful and much stronger than when Lin Yun was in the Heavenly Void.

The holy master was fast and his right hand reached out from his sleeves, clamping onto the sword tip. But the sword contained powerful sword intent that forced the holy master to take three steps back. He wore a smile the whole time, but his face changed this time because Lin Yun was nowhere to be seen when the sword ray dissipated.

The holy master was calm as he threw the Flower Burial Sword away before turning around and throwing out a punch. His attack made Lin Yun throw out a mouthful of blood. The holy master then heaved a sigh in relief because he was really surprised. But then he sensed a dangerous aura just when he wanted to speak, and the Flower Burial Sword flew into Lin Yun’s hand.

“Two Lin Yuns?” The holy master’s face changed because he was confident that he struck the real person. He immediately realized that Lin Yun must have grasped a secret technique to divide himself into two. But it was too late for him to think and he retreated.

As a sword ray flashed, a few strands of the holy master’s hair fell. Just when the holy master wanted to retaliate, Lin Yun threw the Flower Burial Sword to the other Lin Yun, who was throwing out blood.

When a sword ray flew over, the holy master blocked it, and a wound appeared on his palm. He also took a palm to his back that shattered all the flaming halos. But before he could retaliate, Lin Yun stepped forth and the two clones merged, performing Blooming Stars again.

It was different this time because the river's flow could be heard. Lin Yun stood straight as he swung out multiple sword rays with an afterimage flying out each time. When eighty-one afterimages combined, they stabbed at the holy master’s vital point.

The holy master was shocked before he smiled and forgot about venting his anger on Lin Yun but was fully submerged in the fight. He spread his hands apart as a phoenix cry echoed while he flicked his finger. All the afterimages shattered with the flowers withering.

Lin Yun smiled, and performed the Blooming Stars again. This time, countless sword intents condensed into a flower. As the two fought, flowers would bloom and wither. Ten-odd moves later, the two laughed as they fought.

The holy master’s severed hair finally fell onto the ground at this moment, proving how fast their fight was.

“Scarlet Radiance Saint Lord, I know that you might be a Saint Sovereign or a Great Saint, but I have to admit that you’re really strong,” Lin Yun said from the bottom of his heart. “It’s surprising for someone like you to be nameless in the Kunlun Realm. If you’re willing to walk out, I believe your name will spread far and wide.”

The holy master smiled as he found Lin Yun more pleasing to the eye. He smiled, “Many people have praised me, and I’m happy to receive your praise.”

The two fought again, and their fight was more intense this time. A few thousand moves later, Lin Yun’s sword aura reached the limit and couldn’t go any further. But the holy master could hold his ground, which shocked Lin Yun. He then said, “I admit defeat.”

The two stood. Lin Yun wasn’t injured, while the holy master looked more pathetic, covered with superficial wounds. But Lin Yun lost because he couldn’t even inflict heavy injuries in the fight.

“You haven’t used your Sword Domain,” the holy master smiled.

“Is there a meaning in that?” Lin Yun smiled. “You think I don’t have any temper? You said that I only know how to suppress others with my sword intent, and I would still lose if I were forced to use my Sword Domain to face you, not to mention that my Sword Domain can’t bear your sword.”

“Interesting,” the holy master smiled as he squinted.

“What’s the name of that sword?” Lin Yun asked.

“Listening Wind Chime!” The holy master said pridefully.

“That’s right. Can you teach me that?” Lin Yun smiled.

The holy master instantly realized Lin Yun was setting up a trap for him, wanting him to teach that sword technique. But the holy master was happy and refused Lin Yun, “It’s not the time yet. Let’s put an end to it here. I won’t attack. You can come back tomorrow.”

“You can’t hold on any more when I’m just getting started?” Lin Yun smiled.

“You’re just getting started?” The holy master smiled, “Are you going to use your Sword Domain? I’m not lying because you won’t win even if you use it.”

“I still have a sword technique,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Oh?” The holy master’s interest was piqued, and he smiled, “Give it a try, then.”

“Please give me some advice!” Lin Yun no longer held back and executed the Sword of the Beginning. When his sword ray bloomed, it was an entirely different style from his previous sword techniques.

The holy master didn’t take it seriously and soon suffered. When Lin Yun swung his sword, the surrounding time and space distorted, just like how the holy master dealt with Lin Yun earlier, but was even more unfathomable.

Light of the Beginning! Boundless of the Beginning! Glory of the Beginning! Eternity of the Beginning! Darkness of the Beginning! Nirvana of the Beginning!

The more Lin Yun fought, the smoother his sword became and he suddenly felt weird. It felt as though the world in front of him had become blurred with an invisible barrier in front of him. He rejoiced at this scene because he could return to a second before if he passed through this barrier.

This caught the holy master by surprise, and his face changed when he sensed a familiar fluctuation. When a sword ray flew, Lin Yun spun and retreated ten steps back.

When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, a hole appeared in the holy master’s chest, blood gushing out.

The holy master dropped his smile as he touched his wound with a grave expression. A long time later, he looked at Lin Yun with shock and disbelief, “Who taught this sword technique to you?!”

Lin Yun was surprised by the holy master’s reaction because the latter looked calm throughout the entire fight.
