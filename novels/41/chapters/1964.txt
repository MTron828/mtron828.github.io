Chapter 1965 - Nothing Impressive About The Ye Clan

Everything happened too quickly, with Ye Yanbei charging over before anyone could respond. Not to mention Ye Yanbei instantly unleashed his full strength at the sixth transformation of the Nirvana Stage with all his energy gathered in his punch.

His punch gave off a dazzling brilliance, and the surrounding atmosphere felt like a heavy waterfall before his punch even arrived. His punch also gave off a terrifying aura that seemed to rip the sky apart.

This made everyone’s faces change as they retreated, fearing that they might be caught up in it. Ye Yanbei was smart by trying to suppress Ye Qingtian with his cultivation instead of sword techniques. Ye Xin lost terribly because he tried to compete with Ye Qingtian in sword technique and didn’t use his advantage in his cultivation.

When everyone saw this scene, they knew that Ye Qingtian was doomed. After all, how could someone who had just reached the Nirvana Stage possibly fight someone at the sixth transformation of the Nirvana Stage?

But Ye Qingtian didn’t even step back, facing Ye Yanbei’s attack head-on. The clash created an explosion with a powerful shockwave, forcing the spectators to protect themselves with their nirvana auras.

When the dust cloud settled, everyone was shocked to discover that Ye Qingtian didn’t take a step back in the clash. This was something that no one had expected, and they exclaimed, “H-How is this possible?!”

Ye Yanbei was also shocked, but his face sank, and he threw his punch again.

And yet, Ye Qingtian didn’t take a step back, but raised his hands with Netherflower’s petals flying out from his body. This time, they were both clashing with their cultivations with no intentions of taking a step back. Every clash would cause the Netherflower to grow bigger, with more flower petals flying around in the surroundings.

The nether energy could dissolve nirvana aura, thus decreasing the power of Ye Yanbei’s attacks by 30%. As for the remaining 70%, Lin Yun destroyed half of it with his sword intent before facing the remaining half with his two saint physiques.

The Azure Dragon Saint Physique was responsible for clashing head-on, while the Blue Dragon Saint Physique was responsible for treating his injuries.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

This was a competition of exhaustion, and it was unsure who could last till the end as the nether energy slowly accumulated within Ye Yanbei’s body. Ten moves later, the tables were turned around with Lin Yun fighting even more ferociously. He laughed, “Is this the strength of the Ye Clan’s direct lineage? I haven’t had enough fun at all!”

As Lin Yun laughed, he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon and Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. He punched Ye Yanbei, forcing the latter to take three steps back.

“Come again!” Lin Yun laughed and charged forth, not giving Ye Yanbei a chance to catch his breath. His punches were like swords, with black flower petals swirling around his fist like blades.

This instantly made Ye Yanbei feel terrible. After all, he had to resist the nether energy within his body with half of his nirvana aura. He needed time to catch his breath to regain his ground. But Ye Qingtian didn’t give him that opportunity, and he was sent flying after several breaths later.

When Ye Yanbei landed on the ground, he took three steps back with his face changing before he threw out a mouthful of black blood. This instantly shocked all the saint disciples present with disbelief. Many people noticed that Ye Qingtian relied on the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to defeat Ye Yanbei, making them fearful of Ye Qingtian.

On the other hand, the faces of everyone from the Ye Clan were ugly. Bai Yizhou gloated, “It looks like the Ye Clan really doesn’t have anyone amongst their younger generation!”

“Hmph!” Ye Qinghong was furious and pushed his palm forth, circulating his cultivation at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage and inheritance sword sutra.

The floral petals around Lin Yun exploded, and Lin Yun took a few steps back as he faced this attack head-on. Just when everyone thought that Ye Qingtian would be sent flying away, Ye Qingtian suddenly pulled his hand back before pushing it forth. The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron circulated within his body, causing the incoming attack to shatter and he gained his footing.

Was this the strength at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage? It’s a lot more terrifying than the sixth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. If he didn’t use the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron, he might’ve suffered heavy injuries if he faced this attack while relying on his cultivation.

“Is this the strength of someone at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage? Doesn’t seem so impressive after all. Ultimately, you must resort to a sneak attack to barely injure me. It turns out that the Ye Clan is even more unsightly than Zhang Yue. At the very least, Zhang Yue didn’t try to launch a sneak attack on me! Hahaha!” Lin Yun wiped the blood off the corner of his lips, and he spread his arms apart. “I’ll be taking my leave now!”

Everyone was stumped as they watched Ye Qingtian disappear, and Ye Qinghong’s face was ugly. He wanted to teach Ye Qingtian a lesson and establish the prestige of their Ye Clan, but he didn’t expect Ye Qingtian would leave just like that and even mocked him before leaving.

After this brief moment, there was nothing he could do, even if he wanted to catch up. He coldly said, “Let’s go!”

Ye Qinghong’s face was terrifyingly dark as he flung his sleeve and left with the Ye Clan’s members.

Bai Yizhou and Xiao Jingyan stood together with surprises on their faces.

Xiao Jingyan smiled, “It looks like Ye Qinghong is really unhappy!”

“There’s nothing he can do about it. The Ye Clan has so many people, and Ye Qingtian isn’t stupid to fight all of them,” Bai Yizhou said. “But that bastard actually left just like that!”

Bai Yizhou naturally wanted Ye Qingtian to stay behind and continue to fight Ye Qinghong. He wanted to see Ye Qingtian being taught a lesson, but he didn’t expect that Ye Qingtian wasn’t foolish, despite being cocky. He didn’t hesitate to leave after defeating two opponents.

Xiao Jingyan smiled, “No need to hurry. Let him show off for now. The higher he rises, the harder he’ll fall!”

“He’s nothing but a clown,” Bai Yizhou sneered.

Lin Yun was running to his residence after leaving the Solar Jade Palace. It was good news to him that most swordsmen would stay in the Nether Orchid Courtyard. But not long after he left, an old friend actually caught up with him, the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s Wang Yue. The two became friends after fighting, and their relationship became closer after exchanging information in the Contribution Hall.

“Brother Wang, how is it?” Lin Yun asked.

Wang Yue examined Ye Qingtian and asked, “I thought you were injured. But it looks like I’m over-concerned.”

“Speaking of which, your Life Intent is effective in treating injuries, right?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Not bad,” Wang Yue said.

“Come and give it a try, then.” Lin Yun was injured, but he recovered most of his injuries with the help of the Blue Dragon Bone. He couldn’t come out unscathed, even after fighting someone at the sixth transformation of the Nirvana Stage when he had just reached the Nirvana Stage.

When he saw the latter catching up, Lin Yun wanted to let Wang Yue give it a try. He wanted to know the difference between Life Intent and the Blue Dragon Bone. Wang Yue didn’t deny it, and they rushed to Lin Yun’s residence.

Once they reached the courtyard, Wang Yue poured his Life Intent into Lin Yun’s body. Lin Yun had already concealed the Blue Dragon Bone with the Divine Tortoise Transformation.

Lin Yun closed his eyes to sense the difference between Life Intent and the Blue Dragon Bone. The two contained powerful lifeforce, but there was also a huge difference. Wang Yue’s nirvana aura felt alive, and he could rely on his Life Intent to achieve one-third of the healing effects of Lin Yun’s Blue Dragon Bone.

It looks like I have yet to fully excavate the Blue Dragon Bone's potential. Lin Yun inwardly pondered.

When Lin Yun fully recovered, Wang Yue opened his eyes and said, “You’re testing my Life Intent.”

When he injected his nirvana aura into Lin Yun’s body, he noticed that the latter’s injuries weren’t heavy and could recover with a night of rest.
