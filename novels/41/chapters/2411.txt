Chapter 2412 - Overbearing Ancestral Deity

While Dugu Jue, Yue Weiwei, and Ji Zixi waited outside, Lin Yun entered Heaven’s Gate Ancestral Palace. When the gate opened, a dazzling radiance made Lin Yun squint.

When his vision recovered after entering, he saw a breathtaking scene that made him open his mouth with shock. The roof was a starry sky, and the interior was a massive library with countless people doing various things. There were people reading books, playing chess, enjoying flowers, fishing, comprehending, cultivating, and fighting.

They were all people when he raised his head, and they all looked identical to the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity. He was shocked and wondered if the ancestral deity spent his time playing with himself in the Heaven’s Gate Ancestral Palace. He asked, “Are these... all clones?”

The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity nodded, “Yeah. It’s too slow and boring to cultivate alone, and I also have things to handle. So I have clones around at all times, and they will also guide my disciples in their cultivation.”

Lin Yun felt his scalp becoming numb and had no idea how the ancestral deity managed to do it. He had heard that the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity would occasionally lecture in Heaven’s Gate. But it wasn't his actual self, so you could only see the real ancestral deity in the ancestral palace.

Lin Yun didn’t doubt that now, which meant that the person before him might not be his actual self, either.

“Come on. I’m the main body; don’t overthink it. There’s no difference between my clone and the main body. If there’s a difference, it will become my weakness instead,” the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity wasn’t surprised by Lin Yun’s expression as he led Lin Yun to a pavilion.

“Let’s drink while we chat.” The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity took out a jar of Demigod Wine. After pouring a cup for Lin Yun, he smiled, “What request do you have for me? Think carefully before you reply.”

“As for taking you as my master...” Lin Yun hesitated.

The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity smiled, “I can tell that you’re not done with the Kunlun Realm yet. I can see your karma tying you down. So there’s no need to hurry about taking me as your master. Let’s talk about your request first.”

Lin Yun heaved a sigh in relief since he was feeling uneasy earlier. Now that he thought about it, he couldn't hide that many secrets from someone who was at the Ancestral Stage. He asked, “Any request?”

The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity’s eyes flashed with pride, before he smiled, “Although Luo Tianxi said that as long as the request isn’t too much, any request will do. After all, there aren’t many things in the world that I can’t accomplish.”

“I wish to return to Kunlun Realm,” Lin Yun said.

“Change it to another request,” the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity smiled with a hint of awkwardness.

“You can’t do that?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity was stumped, becoming even more awkward. He said, “It’s not that I can’t accomplish it, but it is a rule that was set up by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity that Ancestral Stage experts aren’t allowed to interfere with the other realms. He might be suppressed by fate in the Nether Realm, but no one dares to go against it. Otherwise, the Kunlun Realm would be gone by now. If I go against this agreement, the Demonspirit Clan can also go against it. Do you understand now?”

Lin Yun drank a mouthful of wine but wasn’t too disappointed since he had already expected it. He still had Lin Jiangxian, who had someone who could help him, so he wasn’t anxious about it.

Lin Jiangxian wasn’t someone who would give her promise so easily, and since she said that her master had a method, there must be a reason for that.

Lin Yun pondered, then asked, “Can I revive someone from the dead? I have a friend of mine, and his death has affected me greatly. He took a deadly attack for me when I was weak in the past.”

The person he was referring to was Xin Jue, Ye Xinjue—the chief disciple of the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

“I can if he had died within seven days, but his soul would have dissipated after seven days, and no one can save him then,” the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity said. He said anxiously, “Do you have a more realistic request?”

“Can I have the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron?” Lin Yun asked.

The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity speechlessly said, “The Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron isn’t an ordinary Sovereign Saint Artifact, but something that contains many cultivation techniques and dao rhythms...”

“That doesn’t work as well? Do I need to change to another request?” Lin Yun asked.

The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity raised his brow, and bitterly smiled, “Alright, the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron it is. When the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity gave it to me, I returned him a great favor. But you can’t use it with your cultivation. You have to become a Saint Sovereign if you want to take it away, so it will remain in Heaven’s Gate for now.”

“Does that mean that I can’t bring it back to the Kunlun Realm?” Lin Yun asked.

“It doesn’t matter.” The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity waved his hand, before he continued, “If you can control it completely, you can let it break through the realm barrier and summon it to the Kunlun Realm. The Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron isn’t a weapon in our eyes but something to ensure the inheritance in the sect. It might not be useful to you, so let me give you something else, lest the Blue Dragon King say I’m stingy.”

When he was done speaking, the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity stood up and placed his hand on Lin Yun’s head. Before Lin Yun could respond, the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity released a dazzling radiance and a boundless energy poured into Lin Yun’s body, swiftly destroying his meridians.

This shocked Lin Yun, who discovered that his cultivation was declining. His cultivation dropped from an eighth-stage Saint Lord to a first-stage Saint Lord.

Just when he became baffled, the boundless energy in his body formed into a giant hand, as if it was kneading something to be reforged. His cultivation soon recovered with an even faster speed. The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity was reforging his foundation with each stage being ten times stronger than before.

When the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity was done, Lin Yun’s cultivation had reached the pinnacle of the ninth-stage Saint Lord. His eyes flashed with cracking sounds coming from his body, and he felt as though he was still dreaming.

“This is...” Lin Yun looked at his hand and sensed the boundless saint energy flowing through his body. He was shocked because he didn’t just become stronger, his saint soul, saint pulses, and saint origin had undergone a drastic transformation.

“Was that Baptism?” Lin Yun asked uneasily. He had heard of this before, which required paying a tremendous price to accomplish, and it wasn’t exactly beneficial for a cultivator.

The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity pridefully said, “That’s not an ordinary Baptism, but the Heavenly Dao Baptism. Even an Ancestral Stage expert would have to pay a great price to do it, and we would generally only use it on our descendants. This is because the exhausted heavenly dao energy is more precious than you think. I would also have to exhaust heavenly dao energy to send you to the Kunlun Realm. It’s hard to recover the heavenly dao, or it might not even be possible to recover it. Any Ancestral Stage expert would feel heartache when exhausting it.”

“Thank you, Ancestral Deity...” Lin Yun said.

“I’m not done yet. So why are you in such a hurry to thank me? Don’t interrupt me!” The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity smiled.

Lin Yun quickly shut his mouth. The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity had quite the character and didn’t look like a senior in his eyes.

“Your cultivation has advanced too rapidly recently, and you might have stopped at the Saint Sovereign Realm for at least ten years or even longer,” the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity said. “Only the divine sons can receive Heavenly Dao Baptism, and not even Luo Tianxi has received it. You can feel that your foundation has become stronger and more sturdy. So you don’t have to worry if it will affect you negatively, since I will bear the price for you.”

Lin Yun thanked again after hearing what the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity said.

“You must be thinking about why I didn’t push your cultivation to a Saint Sovereign directly, right?” The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity smiled. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“I didn’t...” Lin Yun said.

The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity glared at him, and said, “Say ‘yes’.”

“Yes.” Lin Yun said, frightened by the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity.

“Good. I have already seen through your thoughts. From a Saint Lord to a Saint Sovereign is a transforming process, and you must rely on yourself to comprehend it,” the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity smiled.

“I see...” Lin Yun showed an ‘understood’ expression since he had long guessed it, and he had no doubt in his heart. But the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity was overbearing, so he dared not refute his words.

“I initially wanted to help you reforge your constellation as well, but I didn’t expect you to comprehend your own Sovereign Constellation, which is unbelievable,” the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity sighed. He continued, “To comprehend a whole new Sovereign Constellation when the Heavenly Path is severed. There’s a high chance that you can reach the Ancestral Stage in the future!”

“What is the Ancestral Stage?” Lin Yun asked.

“The master of dao. Each dao can only contain two to three people, and you have to defeat the master of that dao to reach the Ancestral Stage. But you’re different since you have created your own Sovereign Constellation, and this means that you can create your own position in the future and don’t have to compete for the spot with those from the older generation.”

The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity sounded casual, but each battle was an intense one with countless lives being implicated from their battle.

The two chatted while drinking within the Heaven’s Gate Ancestral Palace. The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity answered Lin Yun’s questions about his cultivation. He didn’t hold back his teachings from Lin Yun, who didn’t take him as master.

“Alright, you should leave first. Let the others come in,” the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity said when they finished the Demigod Wine.

But before Lin Yun could leave, the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity called out to him and said, “Lin Yun, I can help you this much because you want to reforge Kunlun Realm’s Heavenly Path. Don’t die in the Kunlun Realm.”

Lin Yun’s face changed. There's probably some secret about the Kunlun Realm’s Heavenly Path that even made Ancestral Stage experts fearful.
