Chapter 1140 - Profound Wither Key

After Ye Ziling left, Lil’ Purple then came out from the sword box. She had always been fearless no matter who she ran into. However, she would cower whenever she saw Ye Ziling. Since Ye Ziling was gone, Lil’ Purple freely spoke, “That demoness is finally gone!”

“Speaking of which, can I enter the sword box?” Lin Yun asked. He was envious that Lil’ Purple could enter the sword box any time she wanted.

“You want the Iris Sword Saint brat’s inheritance? Let’s talk about it when you reach the Empyrean Realm. You still can’t control the Iris Sacred Flame or refine it. Anyway, the inheritance didn’t belong to him. This sword box has a huge origin, and you’re still too weak right now,” smiled Lil’ Purple.

“What about the Sword Saint Mountain? Didn’t you say that there are some secrets? I didn’t see anything when I reached the summit,” smiled Lin Yun.

“I won’t make a mistake. But I’m not too sure about the secret of the Sword Saint Mountain. It’s just an idea. Hmph, if I’m right, then that mountain has a huge origin,” said Lil’ Purple.

Lin Yun knew that Lil’ Purple would reply mysteriously. So he ignored her and shifted his attention onto the interspatial pouch. He was hoping to find something that could make Lil’ Red stronger. Then again, it must’ve reached a bottleneck in the Ancient Dracoape Art or it would’ve already reached the Empyrean Realm.

But it was a pity that Lin Yun couldn’t understand the Ancient Dracoape Art as it was given to Lil’ Red by Yue Weiwei. Very quickly, Lin Yun turned his attention to Lil’ Purple with a smile, “Empress, have you heard of the Ancient Dracoape Art?”

Pouting her lips, Lil’ Purple turned her head away, “Never! Hmph, didn’t someone want to give me to Ye Ziling earlier? What Ancient Dracoape Art are you talking about? Am I not a brat who needs some teaching?”

Lin Yun laughed when he heard that because Lil’ Purple held a grudge well. Then again, this was what made her adorable in the first place. Patting on his interspatial pouch, Lin Yun took out the bottle of Millennium Flame left to him by Luo Hua and said, “Empress, look at this!”

“Millennium Flame!” Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up before she snorted, “Hmph! It’s nothing impressive. I drank jade dew back then and celestial wines that only saint kings can enjoy. There’s nothing im-impressive about the Millennium Flame.”

She initially wanted to say that there was nothing impressive about the Millennium Flame, but her gaze betrayed her when she took a peek at it.

“It’s for you.” Lin Yun was about to push the bottle over, but it was already snatched away by Lil’ Purple before he could finish speaking. Seeing this, Lin Yun smiled, “Lil’ Red is cultivating the Ancient Dracoape Art and probably reached a bottleneck. Do you have a solution?”

Lil’ Red hopped onto the table and looked at Lil’ purple pitifully. From its expression, one could imagine how vexing it was to be stuck in a bottleneck for so long.

“Hehe, I already realized it. I would have said something even if you didn't ask me. After reaching the third stage in the Ancient Dracoape Art, he’ll need a 5,000 year old fruit containing true dragon blood that’s at least the level of a saint fruit. But it’s a pity…” smiled Lil’ Purple. “The Ancient Dracoape Art was famous back in the golden era, so there were fierce competitions for the fruit. Every time there’s a true dragon blood fruit, the powerhouses of the Demon Clan would fight for it. I’m talking about genuine dragon blood.”

Lin Yun knew that even if the True Dragon Saint Liquid had the name True Dragon in it, it was refined from demonic beasts possessing a dragon bloodline. Although it was precious, the dragon blood wasn’t pure and the purity wouldn’t be perfect no matter how one refines.

When Lil’ Red heard Lil’ Purple’s words, it lowered its head and stared at its paws. It was strong back in the Heavenly Path, and it didn’t want to be a burden on Lin Yun now.

“I don’t have any fruit containing dragon blood. What about deity blood?” Lin Yun probed.

“Divine Blood Fruit!” Lil’ Purple was shocked because she knew that Lin Yun had a Eight-Leaf Divine Blood Fruit with him. If news of it got out, it would definitely draw the attention of countless saints and saint kings.

After all, a Divine Blood Fruit was precious. The value of one leaf even far exceeded the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and just the dews on the leaves were of unimaginable value.

“If it’s the Divine Blood Fruit, just one leaf is enough. But are you sure about that?” Lil’ Purple asked. “Although the current era is incomparable to the golden era, you can still try to find fruits with dragon blood. Each of the leaves is extremely precious, and the value isn’t any inferior compared to the fruit.”

Logically speaking, the fruit should have a high value that not even Dragon Pulse Realm experts could refine, and it was different for the leaves. So some seniors would pay a great price for the leaves to nurture their descendants.

“What is there to be uncertain about?” Lin Yun smiled because Lil’ Red was his brother. Without hesitation, Lin Yun took out the jade bottle from his interspatial pouch and looked at Lil’ Purple cautiously, “Will it alarm others?”

He was mainly talking about the sect master because the sect master’s strength was unfathomable. Lin Yun had a feeling that the sect master had grasped the divine firmament sword intent.

But Lil’ Purple didn’t reply to him and floated in the air with his long hair spread out. As the golden and crimson mark bloomed on her forehead, she looked even more ethereal. As her hands began to change, countless spiritual runes began to appear as they intertwined in the air. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Very quickly, the spiritual runes formed into an array as the two divine runes on her forehead flew out like chains. Instantly, she formed a barrier that enveloped the entire residence. When she was done, Lil’ Purple’s face became pale and the light in her eyes also dimmed down.

“Isn’t this a little too much?” Lin Yun asked, smacking his lips.

“You have no idea how precious the Divine Blood Fruit is. I’m not doing this to hide it from the sect master. You can’t tell right now, but there are too many old geezers in Kunlun Realm. If any of them know what you possess, you won’t make it out alive even if you have ten lives,” said Lil’ Purple.

After Lin Yun unsealed the jade bottle, the Divine Blood Fruit flew out and Lin Yun plucked one of the leaves. The leaf emitted a gentle light with water intent. If it was given to a cultivator who practiced water intent, it would allow that person’s water intent to undergo a transformation.

The leaf was emitting a crystalized luster that made Lil’ Purple lick her lips. She wanted to say something, but she couldn’t lower herself to do it. Seeing this made Lin Yun smile, “I bet empress must’ve drank a lot of dew from divine leaves in the past, right?”

“Hmph, I drank them by the cup in the past,” said Lil’ Purple proudly.

“Well, I don’t have that much now. Open your mouth,” said Lin Yun.

“Hmph, I’ll put up with it then.” Lil’ Purple struggled internally before she opened her mouth for Lin Yun to pour the dew from the leaves into her mouth. When the dew entered her mouth, Lil’ Purple’s face immediately turned rosy with her eyes shining brightly.

Then, Lin Yun turned to look at Lil’ Red who was staring at him. He smiled before he handed the leaf over to Lil’ Red who was hesitating.

“You stupid cat.” Lil’ Purple hugged Lil’ Red and took the leaf from Lin Yun with a smile, “I’ll teach it how to refine. You keep the fruit and give me your token.”

Lin Yun’s token could enable him to go anywhere he wanted in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, so Lil’ Purple could find a secluded location with it. After the two left, Lin Yun’s gaze turned to Thunderclap Sword Demon’s interspatial pouch.

However, he wasn’t expecting much because he already had many Divine Astral Pellets and even a saint artifact. So he didn’t think that there would be anything valuable in the interspatial pouch. After all, Thunderclap Sword Demon was only an empyrean demonic cultivator. So even if he was famous, Lin Yun didn’t think that there would be anything precious in the pouch.

When he flipped through the interspatial pouch, it was just as he expected. There were only a few Divine Astral Pellets, along with miscellaneous items that Thunderclap Sword Demon had stolen. As for the Profound Sky Heavy Armor that he was interested in, he couldn’t find it in the pouch which was something he had already expected.

After all, it was the Profound Sky Sect’s cultivation technique, and there was no way they could allow it to leak to the outside. Truth be told, the resources in the pouch were decent, and it would be considered an enormous wealth to any core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, even Ye Ziling. But it was nothing much to Lin Yun.

Suddenly, Lin Yun had a wisp of surprise flash through his eyes as he retrieved a wooden token from the interspatial pouch, “This is?”

When he crushed the wooden token, an exquisite key appeared that gave off an ancient yet profound aura.

“Profound Wither!” Lin Yun recited the words engraved on the key. He could tell that it had an ancient origin, but he couldn’t see anything beside the ancient engravings. He had a premonition that this key wasn’t that simple.

“That fellow really had some secrets…” Lin Yun pondered over why a disciple of the Profound Sky Sect was in the Profound Azure Prefecture. But Lin Yun tossed this to the back of his mind for now as he didn’t have time to look into the key, “I’ll find out more about it after I get more time!”
