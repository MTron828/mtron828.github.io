Chapter 1935 - Sword Of The Beginning (2)

A blazing fist appeared before Lin Yun in the blink of an eye, and his fist was blazing like a bright sun. Due to Zhang Yue’s deep hatred for Ye Qingtian, he executed the Scarlet Heavenly Fist, a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique, right from the start.

His fist dazzled brightly like a bright sun dying the sky red. Saint runes also appeared in the attack, connecting with Zhang Yue’s aura. Thus, the power behind Zhang Yue’s fist was mighty.

But Lin Yun had predicted it and soared to the sky, avoiding the incoming attack. Although he had avoided it, Zhang Yue’s fist fell onto the ground, creating a colossal gulf that reached a few hundred feet that spread out of the stage.

This caused an uproar, but it was fortunate that there was a Quasi-Saint around, or many people would have been caught up in it. This naturally scared those beneath the stage, and they quickly retreated.

“Isn’t this a little too terrifying? The power of his fist is even stronger than Wang Yue’s sword.” Everyone felt lingering fear and was shocked by the power of Zhang Yue’s punch.

But when they raised their heads, they exclaimed because Lin Beitong’s whip flew over. The whip was forged with metal, and the whip let out a loud crack while unleashing ten-odd whips, leaving behind a crack in the air with every whip. If the whip fell onto someone, even those at the second transformation of the Nirvana Stage would be heavily injured or severed into two.

But Lin Yun merely smiled and executed the Divine Sunchasing Art, dodging the whips, and none of the attacks could even touch his clothes.

“Damn it!” Lin Beitong cussed.

“Hundred Firmament Transformation!” Ye Feifan roared, swinging his sword and unleashing thousands of lightning bolts toward Lin Yun. Each lightning bolt was a sword, and they were so fast that no one could respond in time.

“I don’t believe that you can continue to dodge!” Ye Feifan said coldly.

Lin Yun couldn’t dodge, but he seemed to have predicted this scene and stepped on his Kunpeng constellation. As the Kunpeng flapped its wings, it soared to the sky with a powerful gale sweeping out, and the incoming lightning swords were blown away.

As the four figures brushed past each other, they exchanged ten-odd moves in the blink of an eye. Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Lin Beitong did everything they could, but they still failed to even touch the corner of Lin Yun’s clothes.

They could maintain their composure, initially, but they gradually lost their patience and started swearing. They were at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage and were confident of inflicting severe injuries on Ye Qingtian if they could touch him.

They even planned on humiliating Ye Qingtian and making him beg for mercy. But they were fooled by Ye Qingtian and were like dogs chasing behind him.

“Ye Qingtian, let me see how long you can keep dodging!” Zhang Yue completely lost it. He appeared beside Lin Yun and threw his punch out.

But Lin Yun merely spread his arms apart and retreated while Zhang Yue chased after him. At the same time, Lin Beitong’s whip was like a venomous viper that was launched at him, and his whip left behind many afterimages in the air.

“Descending Saint Swords!” Ye Feifan descended with six saint swords of his constellation. Starlight descended like a waterfall, and his attack was like a waterfall crushing down on Lin Yun.

The combined attacks of Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Lin Beitong even made the sky turn colors, and this made everyone cover their mouths because they couldn’t see any chance of Ye Qingtian turning the tables around.

“It looks like we can no longer dodge, Flower Burial…” Lin Yun looked at his sword with a smile.

This scene made the disciples of the Indigo Thunder Peak panic because it looked as though Ye Qingtian had given up in their eyes.

The Flower Burial Sword in Lin Yun’s hand responded with a buzz, making Lin Yun smile, “Only you know me.”

Lin Yun closed his eyes and held onto the sword hilt as he waited for Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Lin Beitong to get close to him. When they were thirty feet away from him, Lin Yun drew his sword out by an inch, and this inch of sword ray was as dazzling as the sun.

Before anyone could respond, Lin Yun drew out half of the Flower Burial Sword while Zhang Yue’s group of three was horrified to discover that they couldn’t control their bodies. It’s as though the surrounding space had been distorted.

No matter how they struggled, they couldn’t break free from Lin Yun’s sword aura and were carried over instead. When Lin Yun fully drew out the Flower Burial Sword, a sword ray flew out that was like the first gleam of light in the world.

This sword ray easily destroyed the three incoming attacks while everyone could only hear a sword vibration. When they came to their senses, Lin Yun had already sheathed his sword and descended from the sky.

On the other hand, Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Lin Beitong were like ragdolls falling from the sky. This naturally made everyone dumbfounded while the trio watched as Lin Yun descended from the sky with fear in their pupils. When they tried to get back on their feet, they threw out a mouthful of blood before falling onto the ground again.

At this moment, they finally discovered a long gash on their chests, and their ribs were all broken. The sword intent in Lin Yun’s attacks even invaded their bodies, aside from their hearts, causing damage to their dragon pulses and violet palaces. They finally realized that they had just brushed past death and Lin Yun had spared their lives, or they would be dead by now.

“H-How is this possible?” The trio couldn’t accept this result.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he didn’t look at the trio but turned to look at the shocked Wang Muyan instead. He said, “Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, it’s your turn.”

His voice wasn’t particularly loud but thunderous to everyone’s ears.

Wang Muyan took a deep breath and smiled, “There’s no need to differentiate between us so clearly. Why don’t you let me become the champion?”

Her smile was bewitching, looking like a frail woman.

But Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t fall for it and immediately ignored her charm. He replied, “Since you’re not going to fight, I’ll treat it as if you’ve admitted defeat.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Wang Muyan’s face changed after hearing what Lin Yun said, and she snorted before leaving.

“Life really is full of loneliness…” Lin Yun was happily looking at Wang Muyan’s silhouette, and he gently tapped his sword on the ground. But the moment the scabbard touched the stage, the entire stage began to crumble and soon became ruins, with the trio buried in the rubble.

This naturally caused an uproar as Lin Yun awkwardly stood on the ruins. He was only trying to look cool and had no intentions of burying the trio. But it was entirely different in the eyes of others. It was an act of cockiness and showing off.

Lin Yun turned to look at Quasi-Saint Chi Yun, whose face had become black. With an awkward smile, he asked, “You won’t ask me to compensate for this, right?”

Quasi-Saint Chi Yun was naturally furious after hearing what Lin Yun said.
