Chapter 2010 - Disciple

Half a day later, Bai Qingyu was done refining and looked at Ye Qintian with curiosity. But she was deeply shocked within her heart.

“It’s unimaginable that Ye Qingtian’s sword intent is so powerful. My martial intent isn’t weak; I also have a powerful cultivation. But for some reason, I’m weak like paper compared to him, and he can easily stab me with one sword when he opens his eyes.” Bai Qingyu wasn’t a fool. She was the princess of the Bai Clan, and she had seen many geniuses before. She had even interacted with geniuses like the Dao Yang Holy Son.

They were powerful but never made her feel the way Ye Qingtian made her feel. Ye Qingtian was only at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage, but he was so strong it was as though he could even pierce through the sky if he became furious. There was a mist around him that she couldn’t see through. But recalling their experiences together, she couldn’t help feeling a little weird.

She now realized it didn’t sound bad if Ye Qingtian became her brother-in-law. But her sister had refused him, and he must’ve been heartbroken when he was rejected by her elder sister, right? Bai Qingyu couldn’t help feeling heartache for Ye Qingtian.

She wondered if she would refuse if she was the one Ye Qingtian fell for. If she rejected him, Ye Qingtian would be too pitiful. But if she was still a child, if she got together with Ye Qingtian…RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Bai Qingyu slowly became distracted, her face red, and she felt complicated. When she peeked at Ye Qingtian, her face couldn’t help blushing. She had to admit that Ye Qingtian was pretty handsome.

“Bai Qingyu, what are you thinking about?” A voice resounded beside her.

Bai Qingyu came to her senses and saw Lil’ Purple beside her, looking at her weirdly. This instantly made her feel awkward, and she quickly lowered her head, fearing that Lil’ Purple might see through her thoughts. She softly replied, “I’m wondering why Ye Qingtian’s sword intent is so powerful.”

“That’s nothing. I only taught him casually. I haven’t seriously taught him yet,” Lil’ Purple said calmly.

“What?” Bai Qingyu exclaimed, “He’s your disciple?”

“Disciple? He’s only my servant,” Lil’ Purple said in disdain.

“Are you serious about that?”

“What do you think? Why do you think he can change so much in just one year? And who helped you treat your injuries?”

Bai Qingyu was dumbfounded. She never expected that Lil’ Purple was so strong.

“There’s no need to envy him. Your potential is stronger than him, and I still need a maid. If you’re willing to become my maid, not only can I help you awaken your Natal Yin Saint Physique, I can help you transform into the Divine Phoenix Physique,” Lil’ Purple said proudly.

Bai Qingyu’s heart began to beat violently when she heard that. The Divine Phoenix Physique was a divine physique, but she couldn’t help feeling complicated about becoming a maid.

“What’s the matter? Are you unwilling? In my prime, many people queued to become my servant, and I didn’t even bat an eye at them. I’d kill all the men and leave half of the women behind. They must be tested for three years before becoming my maid,” Lil’ Purple said. “See him? He’s only a servant and now a genius within the Heavenly Dao Sect!”

Bai Qingyu began to wonder if she should really consider it.

Right then, Lil’ Purple held her head, her face adorably crunching together. She yelled, “Ouch, that hurts!”

When Bai Qingyu saw this scene, she couldn’t help smiling.

“Stop boasting.” It was Lin Yun, who had finished refining ten-odd beads.

“When did I boast?” Lil’ Purple argued.

“Who’s your servant? Who helped you tie your braids? It looks like you really need a beating,” Lin Yun smiled.

Lil’ Purple held onto her braids and softly said, “I’m just casually talking about it.”

Bai Qingyu couldn’t help feeling envious when she saw this scene. This was how Bai Shuying taught her a lesson when they were young.

Lin Yun looked at Bai Qingyu and asked, “When can she awaken her Natal Yin Saint Physique?”

“In about forty days. She can awaken it after refining my saint blood,” Lil’ Purple said honestly.

“No need to hurry. I have to go out for a moment.”

Bai Qingyu wanted to say something, but Lin Yun already left before she could open her mouth. He was returning to the plains. His strength would improve with every trip. He was treating the Blood Crow Ancestor as his training partner.

Half a month later, Lin Yun retrieved the golden bead. He had already refined all the ordinary beads, with his cultivation reaching the pinnacle of the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage. He hovered in the air and released his nirvana aura. The amount of nirvana aura strands had reached over five hundred thousand strands, and his cultivation was unbelievably deep. If he continued, he might even reach a million strands of nirvana aura upon reaching the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

Aside from that, Lin Yun’s sword sea had reached three thousand feet. The star in his sword sea was roughly the size of a disc, and he wasn’t far from reaching the greater mastery of the Astral Sword Intent.

Lin Yun took out the Flower Burial Sword and it streaked across the sky, splitting a thousand-year Blood Crow that was a thousand miles away in half. This naturally shocked Lin Yun, and he recalled how Jian Jingtian saved him from a thousand miles away while in the Fleeting Cloud Sect. “Manipulating the sword within a thousand miles, I’m slowly catching up to Senior Brother now.”

But his senior brother was a special example. Jian Jingtian had grasped the Astral Sword Intent at the Dragon Pulse Realm, and his sword intent was as dazzling as the sun. He was at the Dragon Pulse Realm for eighteen years, and his dragon pulses had accumulated to a hundred feet. He had immediately reached the Heavenly King Realm when he made a breakthrough.

The Heavenly King Realm was invincible beneath the Saint Realm. The Heavenly King Realm was above the Quasi-Saint Realm and beneath the Saint Realm. This was a special realm that wasn’t easy to reach because it was dangerous. Most importantly, it’s even harder for a Heavenly King to become a Saint than Quasi-Saints.

“It has been a long time since we met. I wonder how high Senior Brother has reached.” Lin Yun summoned the Flower Burial Sword back with a wave. He was slowly catching up with Jian Jingtian’s footsteps, and he didn’t need to look at Jian Jingtian with his head raised like in the past.

Even so, Lin Yun was filled with respect for Jian Jingtian. After all, he might not have been able to stay in the Dragon Pulse Realm for eighteen years like Jian Jingtian.

After sheathing his sword, Lin Yun was prepared to leave. But this time, Bai Qingyu mustered her courage and stood before Lin Yun, “Big Brother Ye, bring me with you. I have already awakened the Natal Yin Saint Physique, so bring me. I believe that I can help you.”

Lin Yun was shocked and couldn’t help looking at Bai Qingyu in a new light. Lil’ Purple said she would need forty-odd days, but Bai Qingyu shrank that to half a month. It appears that she had been working hard for the past fifteen days.

“We’re worried about you because you’ve been going by yourself. I worked hard for the past fifteen days because I wanted to help you,” Bai Qingyu’s facial expression was serious.

Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple, who tugged her arms together and said, “Seeing that she has some talent, I have accepted her as my maid. She has now grasped her Natal Yin Saint Physique.”

Lin Yun frowned, and he asked, “Who allowed you to accept her?”

But Lil’ Purple merely snorted and said nothing.

Bai Qingyu felt a warmth in her heart. She grabbed Lin Yun’s hand and smiled, “Big Brother Ye, Master is just joking around with you. She has accepted me as her disciple, not a maid. Master treats me well, and she never ordered me around.”

Lin Yun smiled and heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that. Although Bai Qingyu wasn’t too reliable, her nature wasn’t bad, and her temperament was more like a child.

Taking her in as a maid wasn't appropriate, but a disciple was more acceptable. He turned to Lil’ Purple, who turned her head away with a snort. Her intentions were clear, she wanted him to apologize, or she wouldn’t talk to him.

Lin Yun smiled before turning to Bai Qingyu, “Let’s go.”

“But Master…”

“Your master’s head doesn’t feel good. She’ll be fine after a while,” Lin Yun said, grabbing Bai Qingyu and leaving. It was time to deal with the Blood Crow Ancestor, since he was more or less done with his training.

Seeing this, Lil’ Purple stomped her foot on the ground, “You scumbag, don’t even dream about snatching my disciple! Lil’ Red, catch up to them!”

Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red left the spiritual array, turning into two streaks of light that chased after Lin Yun.
