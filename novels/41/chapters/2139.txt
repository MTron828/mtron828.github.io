Chapter 2140: Who Dare Claims To Be Invincible?

Not only were the cultivators who were outside the Dragon Mountains surprised when they heard the words "Blood Word Battalion", even the cultivators from the Blood Word Battalion on the Indigo Dragon Path were shocked. The Blood Word Battalion was equivalent to the Divine Dragon Empire’s army, formed by countless experts who far exceeded any other force in the Kunlun Realm.

They would nurture talents through military means, training them by killing others, and their figures could be seen everywhere within the Kunlun Realm and Astral Realms. The moment the Divine Dragon Empire determined their enemies, whether it was a sect or a clan, they would be wiped out by the Blood Word Battalion. In other words, the Blood Word Battalion was a butcher’s knife of the Divine Dragon Empire, a knife stained with blood and they contributed to half of the Divine Dragon Empire’s ferocious reputation.

Individually, they might not be comparable to saint disciples, but they gathered in great numbers and were often training themselves by killing others. Thus, anyone who could survive the training were ruthless butchers. There were also those with extraordinary strength that stood out. These people would be provided with the Dragon Clan’s martial techniques and resources that would make it hard for even holy land geniuses to compete with them in terms of strength.

“White? I know him! He recently emerged from the Blood Word Battalion. He comes from a lower realm, but his aptitude is top-notch.”

“I heard that the Ninth Princess values him greatly, providing him with various resources and even gave him a Divine Dragon Bone. He’s now the leader of the Ninth Princess’ personal guards.”

.

“This is also a ruthless person. I heard that he stayed in the Divine Dragon Empire’s Blood Purgatory Dragon Marsh for ten years. The flow of time inside is different from the outside world, and that means that he has been killing for ten whole years, surviving for the longest time amongst the Blood Word Battalion’s younger generation.” The Blood Purgatory Dragon Marsh was a place filled with endless death. Staying in there for a month might be considered training, but a year would be torture. Those who stayed for more than three years had basically gone insane.

The moment Bai Lixuan revealed his identity, many people recognized him and even his deeds.

From the Dragon’s Head, An Liuyan frowned. She didn’t know this young swordsman, so this made her curious with a hint of caution in her eyes.

Bai Lixuan was enveloped in a powerful sword intent, donned in his white robe. He had a handsome appearance, but his eyes looked especially menacing. He looked at the Heavenly Star Palace and Ancient Moon Sect’s holy sons, and he said, “The two of you want to come at me together or one-by-one?”

“Those from the Blood Word Battalion are just dogs trained by the Divine Dragon Empire. Others might fear you, but I won’t!” The eyes of the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son flashed coldly after already having his anger pent up due to Ye Qingtian, then Bai Lixuan appeared out of nowhere. Did they really think that holy sons were pushovers?

While he spoke, he was already dashing forth, unleashing boundless black smoke with a raise of his hand.

“Heavenly Star Demonic Claw!” The hands of the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son became thin and tough with a black baleful aura enveloping the clouds above him. The black baleful aura manifested into the head of an ominous beast, letting out a roar.

The Heavenly Star Demonic Claw was the trump card of the Heavenly Star Palace, combining saint aura with baleful aura before empowering them with saint dao. It could even threaten those at the Heavenly Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm.

“Stand behind me.” Bai Lixuan took a step forth, standing before An Liuyan as he poured his saint aura into his sword. When he swung his sword, a sword ray like a waterfall gushed out, clashing with the Heavenly Star Demonic Claw.

As sword aura exploded, the hands of the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son clashed with Bai Lixuan’s sword. The moment they clashed, the saint sword shattered, making Bai Lixuan briefly stunned.

This couldn’t help making Bai Lixuan feel a little sad. This might not be a powerful sword, but this was his first sword after he came to the Kunlun Realm, and he had been using it for years.

The Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son held onto a fragment of the sword, and sneered, “The Blood Word Battalion is so poor that they can’t give you a Glory Saint Artifact? It looks like you’re not as strong as rumored.”

The Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son tossed the fragment away and charged forth with murderous intent flashing in his eyes, and his hands became terrifyingly dark like the hands of a demon. He roared, “Let me see how you can carry on becoming arrogant without your sword!”

“You’ve made a mistake if you think that I’m powerless without my sword.” Bai Lixuan remained in the same spot before he took a deep breath. When the demonic claws were about to reach him, a dazzling golden radiance flashed within his eyes and a powerful dragon aura swept out. As Bai Lixuan let out a roar, he clenched his fist as a powerful dragon aura exploded from him.

When his punch clashed with the claws, the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son let out a groan and was sent flying away, throwing out blood in the process.

“The Imperial Dragon Fist!” The Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son exclaimed with fear flashing within his eyes. The Imperial Dragon Fist was a Dragon Clan’s martial technique, commonly known as the most lethal and ferocious fist technique in the Kunlun Realm. Aside from the Sovereign Dragon Fist, there wasn’t a fist technique that could compete with it.

“I don’t believe that you have mastered the Imperial Dragon Fist!” The face of the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son became sinister as he dashed forth. He possessed the Heavenly Star Saint Physique and grasped the Earth Dao, not to mention close-combat was his forté. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The Imperial Dragon Fist was powerful, but it wasn’t easy to master it. That's why the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son refused to believe that Bai Lixuan could fight him bare-handed without his sword.

Bai Lixuan stood firmly on the ground like a mountain, clashing with the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son head-on without falling into a disadvantageous position.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun was having an intense fight with Mu Qianjue. When Mo Cheng and Luo Ying recovered from some of their injuries, they joined the fray to gang up on Lin Yun. They became anxious after seeing that Mu Qianjue couldn’t deal with Lin Yun within a short period of time.

There was still the final battle, and Mu Qianjue might lose his chance to become the champion of the Blue Dragon Record if he revealed too many trump cards. They had to help Mu Qianjue end this battle quickly. They shared the same thoughts as those outside the Dragon Mountains, feeling that Ye Qingtian must be running out of saint aura after undergoing so many battles, and he was barely holding on. So as long as they gave Ye Qingtian enough pressure, they would be able to force the latter into revealing a flaw in his attacks.

But it was a pity that no one knew that Lin Yun had reached the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage before reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm. Not to mention that he had consumed an innate saint fruit. He might not have grasped any saint dao, but Mu Qianjue, Mo Cheng, and Luo Ying combined might not even have as much saint aura as him.

If he brought out the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron at the right moment, Lin Yun could exhaust these three people, even if thirty more geniuses joined the fray to gang up on him.

“Absolute Ice Barrier!” Mo Cheng summoned his constellation, and his saint aura exploded, while raising his palms to the sky. As ice pillars began to intertwine in the air, it formed into a fearsome cage that trapped Lin Yun inside it. When Lin Yun’s sword fell onto it, he wasn’t able to cut through those pillars.

This naturally shocked Lin Yun because there was nothing the Astral Sword Intent couldn’t destroy, not to mention the Flower Burial Sword was also a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact. But he actually failed to even leave a crack on the pillars.

“Even a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase can’t break through the pillars anytime soon, so you can give up!” Mo Cheng sneered.

“Blizzard Galaxy!” Luo Ying began forming seals as light shot down from different directions, connecting each other as they formed into walls that isolated Lin Yun from the outside world.

This immediately made Lin Yun feel as though he was trapped in a small world. Since his sword intent couldn’t achieve a resonation with the outside world, his sword aura began to decline.

On the other hand, a seal appeared on Mu Qianjue’s forehead as he began to devour the saint aura on the Dragon Mountain before he gave off an ancient aura. In the next moment, two wings, one black and one white appeared on his back, symbolizing day and night. Under the fusion of the Phaseless Seal on his forehead, this allowed Mu Qianjue to enter a certain chaotic state.

“That’s the Black White Saint Wings! Can it be that Mu Qianjue is related to the Black and White Emperors?”

“Highly possible. It’s highly possible that geniuses of his calibre are favoured by the Nine Emperors.”

“Is this the weight of a champion from the Heavenly Paths?”

Countless shocked gazes fell onto Mu Qianjue outside the Dragon Mountains. Mu Qianjue had really hidden himself deeply. This move belonged to the Black and White Emperors of the Nine Emperors. With that, Mu Qianjue, Mo Cheng, and Luo Ying had practically brought out their strongest attacks, charging at Lin Yun.

“Die!” Mo Cheng roared as the ice barrier began to shrink, causing space to compress. This had already touched the surface of space dao.

“You guys are starting to get on my nerves.” A cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s eyes as he started to lose his patience. He didn’t want to play with these people any longer. As he raised his sword to the sky, his dual sword stars flew out. The sun manifested into a golden screen in the sky while the moon manifested a lake on the ground.

“Dragon Sun and Moon Seal—Inverting Yin-Yang!” Lin Yun swung his sword down as the golden screen and silver lake swapped places. At this moment, it felt as though Lin Yun’s sword had caused heaven and earth to switch places.

In the eyes of Mo Cheng, Luo Ying, and even Mu Qianjue, their world began to distort with the sky and earth swapping places. As a result, the attacks released by the trio disappeared when the surrounding space distorted.

When Lin Yun swung his sword again, the heaven and earth inverted again with a powerful sword ray containing the profundity of yin and yang flying out.

“Not good!” Mo Cheng and Luo Ying were horrified to the point that their souls were trembling as they looked at the incoming sword ray.

Everything felt unbelievable to them. The heaven and earth swapping places made Lin Yun look like a deity as he hovered in the air. When the sword ray arrived, Mo Cheng took the attack head-on. Although he had tried his best to dodge, the sword ray still sliced off a small portion of his body, and the pain made Mo Cheng’s face become distorted.

Luo Ying was also sent flying away, kneeling on the ground while coughing up blood as her vitality was gradually being sapped from her.

This scene made everyone outside the Dragon Mountains take a deep breath. Those from the Heavenly Dao Sect on the Azure Dragon Path were also dumbfounded because they didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to become so terrifying.

The Dao Yang Holy Son awkwardly smiled, “What a terrifying sword that perfectly brought out the advantage of his dual sword stars. He’s really a monster.”

“I don’t doubt that. Even if Flower Burial was here, he might not be able to compete with Ye Qingtian in terms of the sword.” One must know that Flower Burial was publicly acknowledged as the strongest swordsman amongst the younger generation. But Ye Qingtian’s sword made everyone’s scalps go numb and many younger generation cultivators felt despair when they looked at his attack.

They couldn’t help comparing Ye Qingtian with Flower Burial, and this was the highest form of praise for Ye Qingtian.

Many cultivators from the Heavenly Dao Sect could feel their blood boiling. Was this Ye Qingtian, the swordsman prodigy of their Heavenly Dao Sect, who heavily injured a holy son and a holy maiden, instantly immobilizing them?

Mu Qianjue might not be heavily injured, but he was also sent flying away to the edge of the Dragon’s Head, and he was only one step away from falling off of it.

“Senior Brother Ye is invincible!”

“Haha! Even a Champion of a Heavenly Path cannot be compared to our Heavenly Dao Sect’s Senior Brother Ye!”

“Who dares claim to be invincible in front of Senior Brother Ye?!”

“Even if Flower Burial was here, he might not be able to compete with Senior Brother Ye!” Their blood boiled with their emotions spiralling out of control as they cheered. They have been penting up their emotions for a long time when everyone was mocking Ye Qingtian, saying that he took the easy way on the True Dragon Path and even had a relationship with a demoness.

But now, the entire world had become silent, subdued by Lin Yun’s sword. After all, even the champion of a Heavenly Path wasn’t able to take his attack head-on, so who else could stop him?
