Chapter 1837 - It’s Really You!

Everyone was charging towards the crystal statue, and their gazes were on the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. Even if it wasn’t a treasure, just its beautiful appearance alone was enough to make many people tempted.

That was the same for Lin Yun because he had a feeling that the value of this Golden-Purple Dragon Crown wasn’t at all inferior to the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. There was even a possibility that the crown was even more valuable!

Lin Yun and the man with a bamboo hat rushed to the front, and they both arrived before the throne in just ten-odd breaths. But just when they were close, two figures immediately charged towards Lin Yun.

There were many Profound Life Stage experts here, but there weren’t many who reached the pinnacle of the seventh stage Profound Life Stage. These two should be from the Ming Cult or Heavenly Flame Sect, and they had sealed their cultivation before entering like Gu Jun.

Facing the attacks of two pinnacle Profound Life Stage experts, Lin Yun’s face sank. But he didn’t turn around, nor did he have any desire to fight them head-on. He yelled, “Old man, still not going to help?”

“That bastard…” Gu Jun cursed. He had been watching Lin Yun. When he saw Lin Yun stopped by two pinnacle Profound Llife Stage experts and had no intention of retreating, he furiously cursed out. He then turned into a shadow and faced the two pinnacle Profound Life Stage experts’ attacks head-on.

When a powerful dragon origin shockwave swept out, everyone was shocked to see Gu Jun blocking the two pinnacle Profound Life Stage experts’ attacks head-on.

“Who are you?” The black-clothed man and the other middle-aged man were surprised because they didn’t think anyone could block their joint attacks. After all, they weren’t ordinary cultivators at the Profound Life Stage but were both at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage and had sealed their cultivation. So they naturally had an advantage against those who were at the same cultivation.

“Haha! I’m your father!” Gu Jun was in a foul temper ever since he met Madam Tian, and he was naturally even more unhappy that he had to help Lin Yun. Before the black-clothed man and middle-aged man could respond, a loud howl echoed that made everyone feel a huge mental blow.

“Great Saint Tune!” The faces of those in the pinnacle Profound Life Stage who wanted to chase after Lin Yun changed.

On the other side, the man with a bamboo hat was also hindered by Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng. The two weren’t willing to make a move against Lin Yun, so they could only go after the man with the bamboo hat.

But even when facing two enemies, he wasn’t at the slightest disadvantage. When the saint artifacts fell on him, it only produced a metallic collision along with countless sparks. But his palm glowed with a golden radiance and manifested into a dragon’s claw with his nails becoming sharp.

At the same time, many people fought for the treasures on the pillars. With that, the entire vault fell into chaos with dragon origin fluctuating out. After all, they could immediately leave now as long as they grabbed something, and no one bothered hiding their strengths any longer.

But Lin Yun didn’t care about that and sent a few people flying away before he came to the throne.

“Sorry about this.” He first apologized to the crystal statue before reaching out towards the crown.

“Haha, it’s better to come on time than to come early. Lin Yun, we meet again.” Just when Lin Yun was going to reach out for the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, a peal of smug laughter resounded. When Lin Yun swept his gaze through, he saw Ao Feng and Yan Cangming charging at him from both sides.

They were both at the fourth stage Profound Life Stage and donned the Nethermoon Saint Armor. Under the empowerment of the Nethermoon Saint Armor, both of them could actually unleash their strength at the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage.

This made Lin Yun’s face change because he never expected that they would be here so quickly. Facing these two God Generals who had gotten a lot stronger, Lin Yun didn’t dare to treat them lightly and flicked his wrist, unleashing nine chains from his wrist that clashed with their palms.

When the collision took place, purple lightning flickered, and he relied on this Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact to fend off their attacks.

When Ao Feng and Yan Cangming landed on the ground, their faces were pale and they staggered a few steps back before they managed to regain their foothold. So this naturally made the two surprised, and they exclaimed, “How is this possible?!”

Lin Yun didn’t even bring out his sword nor released his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. He relied on the nine chains to catch his opponents by surprise. Ao Feng and Yan Cangming should rejoice that Lin Yun hadn’t refined this treasure. Otherwise, it would be uncertain if they would still be alive now, even with the Nethermoon Saint Armor. But his footsteps ultimately stopped and the nine chains returned to Lin Yun.

“As expected of the Nirvana Banquet’s champion. You really have a lot of treasures, but I’ll be taking the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown!” The Fire God General sneered as he walked towards the throne.

Whenever Lin Yun wanted to move, the two God Generals would unleash their attacks and prevent him from approaching. Right then, several demonic cultivators dashed out. They had been hiding themselves all along. The Fire God General might be strong, but they couldn’t resist the temptation of the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, and there were many people willing to put their lives on the line.

“You guys are courting death!” The Fire God General’s pupils became red, and he activated the Nethermoon Saint Armor. As the saint runes bloomed, the Nethermoon Saint Armor was a lot stronger in his hands than the other two God Generals, not to mention his strength was at the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage.

In the blink of an eye, those demonic cultivators were knocked flying away, and some who had weaker cultivation died on the spot.

“Who dares to stop me?” The Fire God General snorted and swept his gaze around. When he took a step forth, he left behind multiple afterimages with flames blazing within his pupils, reaching out for the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.

But just when he came in contact with the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, a dragon roar reverberated. This caused the entire vault to start trembling, and the dragon on the crown opened its eyes with lightning flickering within its pupils. At the same time, a boundless dragon aura swept out that made the Fire God General throw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away.

“Big Brother!” Ao Feng and Yan Cangming immediately gave up hindering Lin Yun and rushed towards the Fire God General.

This made the faces of everyone in the hall change because no one expected the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown to possess such a horrifying power. The Fire God General’s facial expression was dark with blood dripping from his right hand, and the wound was so deep that even bones could be seen.

When another dragon roar echoed, the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown came to life, as if it had been awakened after a hundred thousand years.

The dragon then turned into a Golden-Purple Divine Dragon that was about an arm’s length and emitted a horrifying dragon aura that shuttled around the hall. No one could grab it, no matter how they tried, and their bodies would blow apart if they came in contact with it.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Holy shit, so terrifying?!” Everyone’s faces changed, and they were afraid to come in contact with the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon. Then, they turned to look at the Fire God General and wondered how strong he was. Was he really only at the seventh stage Profound Life Stage?

Even the other Profound Life Stage experts would be blown apart if they came in contact with it, but the Fire God General only suffered some light injuries. It made no sense, even with the Nethermoon Saint Armor on.

“Don’t come after me!” Gu Jun was terrified when he saw the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon coming in his direction, and he quickly ran towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun tried to reach out to the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon, but he failed to grab it. The Golden-Purple Divine Dragon ignored him and continued flying around the hall, as though it was finding an owner, but it looked like it was just shuttling around without any pattern.

“That was really dangerous.” Gu Jun said with lingering fear.

When the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon flew towards the man wearing a bamboo hat, that man didn’t hesitate to reach out for the dragon. When a dragon's roar echoed from his body, a Golden Dragon’s aura swept out, and his hand turned into a Golden Dragon’s claw.

When the man who wore a bamboo hat came in contact with the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon, the dragon began to struggle in his hand and emitted terrifying lightning flickers. But that man merely relied on his powerful physique to resist the lightning.

“What a powerful physique!”

“That’s the Dragon Clan’s body-refining technique!”

“The Golden Dragon’s lineage? What is that fellow’s origin?” Exclamations resounded from the surroundings because they didn’t expect there would be such a monstrous genius amongst them.

On the other hand, Lin Yun finally confirmed who this person was, and his previous speculation wasn’t wrong.
