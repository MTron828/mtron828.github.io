Chapter 431 - Dragon-Tiger Fist VS Dragon-Tiger Fist

Darkhorse VS Darkhorse. The battle between Lin Yun and Tong Yuan had attracted everyone’s attention. But strictly speaking, they couldn’t be considered darkhorses. First, everyone already knew of Lin Yun. Afterall, he had proven himself during the wedding. It was just that people had underestimated his strength because he crippled his profound vein.

As for Tong Yuan, he had a high status in the Heavenly Profound Sect. His status was comparable to Ye Feng’s status in the Sword Firmamant Pavilion. It was just that not many people knew about him because he had been in seclusion. But no matter what, the two had already proven their strength and their battle was something no one had expected, especially since both of them used the Dragon-Tiger Fist.

Tong Yuan frowned his brows on the stage, making an ugly face. He was unhappy that Lin Yun had belittled him. An outsider actually dared to use the Dragon-Tiger Fist against him? It was akin to slapping his face.

“Lin Yun, are you looking down on me, Tong Yuan, or are you looking down on the entire Heavenly Profound Sect?!” Tong Yuan was furious as he continued, “Draw your sword. I’ll wholeheartedly accept my loss if I’m defeated by your manifestation stage Aquaselenic Sword!”

“I’m sorry, but I don’t intend on using my sword.” Lin Yun wanted to explain that he didn’t look down on Tang Yuan. It was precisely because Tang Yuan was proficient in the Dragon-Tiger Fist that Lin Yun wanted to use the Dragon-Tiger Fist. He wanted to fix his flaws. But he knew that it wouldn’t be easy to explain, so he gave up thinking about it. Why should he, Lin Yun, care about what others think?

“Arrogant!” Lin Yun’s words had thoroughly enraged Tong Yuan. Tong Yuan’s bones began to crackle and his already robust body grew by another size. His muscles looked as if they were forged with metal, which made him look like a golden statue. Looking at Lin Yun, Tong Yuan continued, “Lin Yun, you’re not going to explain yourself?”

“Why should I?” replied Lin Yun with a hint of annoyance in his eyes. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Alright. Go and die then!” Tong Yuan roared. When he placed both his palms on his chest, a Buddhist glow radiated from his back along with a ‘卍’ symbol. In that split second, Tong Yuan’s aura had reached an unbelievable height.

“That’s the Vajra Battle Physique! It’s the body-refining technique of the Heavenly Profound Sect. This Tong Yuan has probably reached the level of invulnerability height.”

“Tong Yuan is enraged. After all, it makes no sense for him to reveal this trump card so early on.” The spectators were shocked by this scene.

“Let’s see how arrogant this brat continues to act!” The Heavenly Profound Sect’s elders sneered at Lin Yun.

However, there weren’t any changes in Lin Yun’s expression as a resounding sword buzz rang out from his body. He released his sword intent to perfectly fuse with his tiger and dragon aura. In that split second, he looked like a sword standing on the stage.

“Undying Vajra Seal, Dragon-Tiger Steps!” roared Tong Yuan. His hands swiftly formed an ancient seal as he took a step out at the same time. Every step he took caused the stage to tremble. It even felt like the entire world was shaking.

“Great!” Lin Yun also used the Undying Vajra Seal, Dragon-Tiger Steps. Unlike Tong Yuan, he didn't emit a buddhist aura, but instead, he emitted the aura of a peerless sword. The face-off caused the eighth stage to tremble violently. It was so strong that the ripples could even be felt from the spectating stage.

“Those two…”

“Just which one is the authentic Dragon-Tiger Fist?” The spectators were shocked because they couldn’t tell which was the authentic one. When the two took nine steps out, their auras manifested into a soaring dragon and leaping tiger as they punched each other.

When the two punches clashed, Lin Yun felt his entire hand going numb. At the same time, Tong Yuan’s aura also started to crack under his sword aura.

“Hehe, this is only the beginning. Come again!” Gaining a small advantage from the clash because of his cultivation, a cold smile rose on Tong Yuan’s lips. “Flying Dragon, Leaping Tiger!”

“You think I’m afraid of you?” Lin Yun also used the same move. The two of them were like dragons soaring into the sky and clashing into each other. However, before they landed on the ground, they both turned around and unleashed the real killing move of this attack. The buddhist aura clashed with the sword aura in the sky. It looked as though a sword had transformed into a dragon as it fought with a golden vajra.

With a darkened face, Tong Yuan’s aura became murky as ink, but so did Lin Yun’s. This made all the spectators confused.

“What’s going on? Holy shit, why can’t I see anything? What are the two of them doing?” Many people were anxious because this was the most exciting battle since the Dragon Gate Competition began.

Tong Yuan and Lin Yun’s figures suddenly became blurred and the spectators could only sense a horrifying power brewing on the stage. Just when everyone was baffled, the scene began to clear up as Tong Yuan unleashed a roar with his Dragon Painting. A painting unfolded behind him with a dragon that pounced at Lin Yun from Tong Yuan’s fist. The terrifying aura of this attack made the atmosphere on the stage feel suffocating.

“Die!” Tong Yuan’s face became sinister.

“Dragon Painting!” A painting also appeared behind Lin Yun, but his was dazzling like a sword. Tong Yuan’s painting was a dragon, but his was a sword. A sword that would destroy everything that stood in his way.

The two punches clashed and they were evenly matched.

Damn it! Tong Yuan cursed inwardly. He was shocked to realise that cracks started to appear on his dragon image. He instantly drew himself out from the clash and swung his fists forward with the Soaring Dragon.

Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by this and faced Tong Yuan head-on with the same attacks. In their hands, the Dragon-Tiger Fist had manifested into powerful moves. Every single clash was accompanied by a resounding boom.

Finally, when they unleashed the last move of the Dragon-Tiger Fist, the Vanquishing Dragon and Tiger, Lin Yun was sent flying with a groan and landed on the edge of the stage. When the dust settled down, Tong Yuan landed on the ground with his upper clothes ripped, revealing his sturdy muscles and a dragon and a tiger thatwas deeply imprinted on his body.

“Dragon-Tiger Empowerment!”

“Could it be that Tong Yuan has reached complete mastery in the Dragon-Tiger Fist?”

“I heard that upon reaching complete mastery, you’ll manifest a dragon and a tiger, which you can use to fight. No wonder Lin Yun lost.”

“Yeah. He’s not a monk, so he can’t achieve that.” A roar rang out from the crowd when everyone saw the tattoos on Tong Yuan’s body.

The Dragon-Tiger Fist is truly profound. Lin Yun muttered inwardly with his eyes narrowed into slits. It seemed like he still had a ways to go in this technique. He instantly changed his strategy and wandered around on the stage with the Seven Profound Steps. He gave up on facing Tong Yuan head-on and started using the advantage in his movement technique, he landed a countless barrage of punches on Tong Yuan’s body. However, all his punches felt as though he was hitting a metal wall. In fact, Tong Yuan stood on the stage, unmoving.

“It’s useless. Don’t you know? I’ve already reached the stage of Vanquishing Dragon and Tiger. You won’t be able to harm me with your Dragon-Tiger Fist, but I can harm you with mine,” snickered Tong Yuan as he threw a punch out. The dragon and tiger tattoos on his body looked as though they had come to life as they coiled around his hand and enveloped Lin Yun.

There was no way Lin Yun could dodge this attack. He was sent flying with blood dripping from his lips.

“I already said that you’re courting death to use the Dragon-Tiger Fist before me!” Tong Yuan didn’t give Lin Yun any time to recover and dashed over before Lin Yun landed on the ground.

As he ran, he formed seals with both his hands, overlapping the Undying Vajra Seal, Sky Breaking Seal, and Vanquishing Demon Seal together. When the three seals overlapped, Tong Yuan’s aura had reached the Violet Palace Realm and he emitted a golden glow.

“Holy shit…”

“Three combined seals… That’s the three combined seals!”

“He’s going to kill Lin Yun!” Many people’s faces changed when they saw this scene. Lin Yun was already injured by Tong Yuan, so he would surely lose his life if he was hit by the three combined seals.

Although Tong Yuan was powerful, it wasn’t enough to kill Lin Yun. Then, Lin Yun’s aura began to fluctuate as he formed the three seals as well. He emitted a powerful sword aura once he finished forming the three seals. But that wasn’t all. His origin energy manifested into thirty-three swords, which opened up behind him like a fan.

“That’s the Heavenly Seal!”

“No!” The Heavenly Profound Sect’s elders all stood up from their seats with shock on their faces when they saw this scene. When Lin Yun landed on the ground, his eyes became bloodshot as he unleashed his attack, the four combined seals!
