Chapter 1706 – Lin Yun (2)

In the next moment, thunderstorms raged, and bloody flames rampaged. As the ferocity turned into a phoenix cry, the entire Cloud Fragrance Hall trembled, and the musical notes played by the Exquisite Court’s disciples crumbled when they came in contact with the phoenix cry.

This was too shocking. Even the three Exquisite Court’s disciples were dumbfounded as they looked at Lin Yun with shock.

As Lin Yun played musical notes with the lute, every vibratoin of the lute string would manifest into a crimson shockwave, and the lute music was like an endless storm.

The Exquisite Court’s disciples all had pain on their faces. Whenever they tried to play their musical instruments, they would throw out a mouthful of blood before they could even play a single note. Not long later, they all covered their ears with their faces being distorted from their pain.

This scene shocked everyone in the Cloud Fragrance Hall. Is this Lin Xiao’s true strength?

Without Xu Dongfei, the Exquisite Court’s disciples who defeated Zhang Mu, Zuo Hongyan, and Xiang Feiluan couldn’t even put up a resistance against Lin Yun.

“That’s the Prairie Phoenix Fire!” Zhang Mu, Zuo Hongyan, and Xiang Feiluan recognized the score that Lin Yun was playing, and they were all shocked.

Right then, a phoenix cry echoed throughout the hall. This phoenix cry was aloof and ethereal, and a phoenix enveloped in flames descended from the sky. The Exquisite Court’s disciples immediately fell to their knees when the phoenix appeared.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye, and the battle ended shortly after it started. The speed of the battle’s end had surpassed everyone’s imagination. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lin Yun stood up and looked in the Exquisite Court’s direction, “Does anyone else wish to challenge me?”

His words were like a bolt of lightning that rumbled beside the ears of the three Exquisite Court’s elders. The three elder’s lips twitched, but they were so shocked that they couldn’t utter a word. They all had fury blazing within their pupils and felt greatly humiliated.

They wouldn't have said those words earlier if they knew that Xu Dongfei would be defeated so quickly. Now, their words came around to slap their faces because all of the Exquisite Court’s disciples were defeated by Lin Yun.

“The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion is truly worthy of being one of the Four Musical Houses. The Exquisite Court has lost, so we won’t come again within a century!” They were all depressed, and the leader of the three elders ultimately stood out before leaving with Xu Dongfei and the others.

Looking at this group of people leaving, Lin Yun didn’t say anything, but the Cloud Fragrance Hall was already filled with cheers. When countless gazes fell onto Lin Yun, there was no more dissatisfaction, and their pupils were filled with respect.

Turning around to look at Mu Xueling, Lin Yun smiled, “Saint Elder, you said that you’d make me spit out all the Profound Saint Pellets that I have consumed if I lost. So, what are you going to do now that I’ve won?”

Everyone’s lips twitched because Lin Yun was still as arrogant as before. He had just defeated the Exquisite Court and now wanted to ask the Saint Elder for a reward. They no longer had any hostility towards Lin Yun like before and felt that his ability was worthy of his arrogance and should be rewarded.

Mu Xueling, who had always remained indifferent, couldn’t help smiling before she waved her hand. As a wine jar flew towards Lin Yun, she said, “This is the Myriad Flower Wine brewed on the Divine Mountain. It’s brewed with ten thousand different flowers for a thousand years. It’s yours, now!”

Receiving the wine jar, Lin Yun opened it and took a sniff. He instantly couldn’t control himself and started gulping it down. He raised the wine jar with his right hand, and the wine flowed into his mouth like a stream. This gorgeous wine needed a thousand years to brew, but Lin Yun didn’t take long to finish it.

“Hahaha! Good wine!” After Lin Yun finished the wine, he said in a somewhat drunken stupor before tossing the empty jar aside.

Looking at this, Mu Xueling’s cheek couldn’t help trembling. After all, finishing such a precious wine in one go was a complete waste.

While everyone was dumbfounded, Lin Yun sat down and started singing with the lute.

“Drunken today when there’s wine, celebrating my comrades returning from the battlefield.

“The world is massive, and nothing can stop my freedom.

“Receiving orders, facing dangers, bragging about my achievements, and never retreating.

“Let me brave through my journey!”

In the beginning, everyone thought Lin Yun was in a drunken stupor, but they were shocked after hearing him singing. Lin Yun sang as he played the lute, and his beautiful voice instantly captivated everyone. When they pondered over the song's lyrics, they were dumbfounded when they looked at Lin Yun again.

“Drunken today when there’s wine, celebrating my comrades returning from the battlefield.”

“The world is massive, and nothing can stop my freedom.

“Receiving orders, facing dangers, bragging about my achievements, and never retreating.

“Let me brave through my journey!”

Lin Yun played the lute and gave Mu Xueling a brilliant smile.

Seeing Lin Yun’s smile, Mu Xueling blushed, and she didn’t dare to look straight at Lin Yun.

With a smile, Lin Yun felt great after he was done playing the song.

“Senior Brother Lin, play another song!”

“Senior Brother Lin, play another song!”

Cheers echoed in the Cloud Fragrance Hall just when Lin Yun was going to stand up. All the disciples had gone insane, and Lin Yun’s mind cleared up a little, instantly placing him in an awkward position. But he soon sank into the surrounding atmosphere because this didn’t feel bad, and a smile soon rose on his lips.

“I’ll play another song?” Lin Yun was a little dizzy from the alcohol, but he still smiled at everyone.

“Okay!” Everyone in the hall echoed.

“Hahaha! Let’s play another song, then!” Lin Yun smiled and started singing another song, “The mundane world is laughable, and infatuation is boring.

“It’s not bad to turn a blind eye as this life has yet to end.

“Smile to others when you’re awake, and forget it all when you’re dreaming.

“Lamenting that the sky turned dark too early, and life is too unpredictable.”

Mu Xuelong, who had already walked a distance out, suddenly stopped when she heard Lin Yun’s song. She couldn’t help turning around to see Lin Yun playing the lute and singing.

“Resolving love and hatred, sing to the wind, and I’m only willing to stay happy till I become old.

“Even if the wind is cold, I don’t wish to run any longer.

“Even if the flowers are beautiful, I don’t want them.

“The higher the sky, the smaller the heart. I seek not karma, for I am filled with pride.”

Mu Xueling stopped completely and couldn’t figure out how Lin Yun came up with such beautiful lyrics. Did he write them himself?

When Lin Yun was done with this song, the crowd briefly savored it before they cheered again. Lin Yun was smiling as he looked at the crowd. But just when he was going to sing another song, he was stumped when he saw a young lady looking at him in the crowd.

This lady had an adorable pair of crescent eyes, and her face beneath the hood was akin to a hundred blooming flowers. Lin Yun’s mind was blank at this moment because he had no idea when Yue Weiwei arrived.

He wanted to leave by instinct, but he could only smile for some reason. As if there was a rapport between them, the girl also smiled, and the reunion was beautiful. At this moment, everything became insignificant under their smiles.
