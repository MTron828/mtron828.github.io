Chapter 1939 - Sword Of The Beginning

While watching the Indigo Thunder Peak Master losing his composure, Lin Yun stowed the medal and smiled, “Thank you for your praises.”

“Two bottles aren’t enough. One more!” The Indigo Thunder Peak Master said.

“It’s more than enough,” Lin Yun smiled, stowing the remaining three hundred thousand Nirvana Pellets.

“Secluded disciple… That’s equivalent to half the position of a Saint Elder. Ye Qingtian, you must be grateful to the Dragon Origin Great Saint,” the Indigo Thunder Peak Master said solemnly. “The Dragon Origin Great Saint might not seem friendly, but he has a warm heart. A few hundred years ago, he hugged the corpses of his disciples and cried. It’s hard to imagine seeing a Great Saint cry.”

Lin Yun asked, “Was he not accepting any more disciples because of this? What exactly happened?”

“The past is the past, and I was young then,” the Indigo Thunder Peak Master said, unwilling to mention it further. He continued, “Right, all the newly conferred saint disciples must be stationed in the God Burial Woods for half a year. So you have to be prepared for it.”

“The God Burial Woods?” Lin Yun was surprised because he had long heard of it before. There were myths that many deities died in the God Burial Woods, and the far end was the purgatory’s border.

Many terrifying existences escaped death three thousand years ago and were sealed there, and some escaped there, waiting for darkness to return. The Myriad Demon Peak that Lil’ Purple went to was a similar place to that.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master looked at the changes on Lin Yun’s face and smiled, “You’ll only be stationed there for guarding purposes. The God Burial Woods is a forbidden ground, but it’s not as terrifying as you think. At most, you’re only required to clear some demonic beasts, and you won’t be involved in anything dangerous.”

Lin Yun nodded because it was considered the obligation of the holy lands’ disciples. Since he enjoyed the resources of the Heavenly Dao Sect, he naturally had an obligation to serve, maintaining the prestige and interest of the holy land.

After bidding farewell to the peak master, Lin Yun returned to his residence. Lil’ Purple held onto her head as she blankly stared at the moon. He didn’t need to ask to know that something had happened to the Solar Lunar Divine Rune.

Lil’ Purple had been sneaking into the Nether Orchid Courtyard during this period, and her emotions heaved up and down because of it. The Solar Lunar Divine Rune had practically become a prick in her heart. The Solar Lunar Divine Rune was clearly within her reach, but she couldn’t obtain it, naturally driving her insane.

“Empress, what’s the matter?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s nothing. I’m just looking at the moon,” said Lil’ Purple.

Lin Yun wanted to make her happy, seeing that she was so depressed. So he shared with her that he had become the champion of the Di Group. He said, “Five hundred thousand contribution points; I should be able to exchange quite a bit of True Dragon Saint Liquid with it.”

“Really?” Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up, but her mood soon died. She said, “It’s fine. You can exchange them for cultivating resources for yourself. I’m not in a hurry.”

Seeing this, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling heartache. But he didn’t know how to comfort her, so he caressed her head before entering the room to rest.

After a series of battles, Lin Yun had some comprehension and needed to digest them. But Ye Feifan, Zhang Yue, and Lin Tongbei were too weak. His deepest impression was Wang Yue, who possessed the Life Intent. If they continued to fight, Lin Yun would have to been forced to bring out his trump cards.

It took a lot of work to grasp the Life Intent, and even Lin Yun had no method to grasp it. He actually had the potential to grasp the Life Intent because of the Blue Dragon Bone that represented brimming vitality.

He suddenly thought about the weirdo he ran into at the Celestial Purging Mountain, Chen Zhong. There was a high possibility that Chen Zhong had grasped the Death Intent, but it was a pity that Chen Zhong partook in the Tian Group, and they didn’t have an opportunity to fight. But he was surprised that the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden chose not to fight him.

Lin Yun closed his eyes, and the golden human within his sword sea began to practice all the techniques used in the fights during the day under the spark. After executing them, Lin Yun fell into comprehension, with his mind blank.

At the same time, he also executed the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon and Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, controlling his dragon origin to course throughout his body. His cultivation had reached the fifth channel of the Profound Death Stage, and he could make a breakthrough with so many Nirvana Pellets.

But he wasn’t in a hurry to make a breakthrough now and had to make a trip to the Contribution Hall tomorrow to exchange his points for the Saint Realm section of the Divine Sunchasing art before going into seclusion in the Three-Lives Realm.

Two hours later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and let out a breath with his pupils shining brightly. He took a deep breath and felt great. His strength had drastically boosted during this period in the Heavenly Dao Sect, which was the benefit of cultivating in a holy land.

The boost of his strength was even faster than his time at the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. Not only did he reach the fifth channel of the Profound Death Stage, but his sword intent has reached the Astral Sword Intent. Moreover, he reached the tenth sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword and was three swords away from mastering it completely. At that time, he could uncover the profundity of this sword technique, which could significantly boost his strength when fighting geniuses in the same generation.

“Mhm?” Lin Yun saw Lil’ Purple still lying outside the courtyard, looking at the moon with Lil’ Red accompanying her. She usually appeared hyperactive, but now she looked depressed, staring at the moon. On the other hand, Lil’ Red was licking its claws beside her.

Suddenly, a piece of flute music resounded, and the moonlight shone down on Lil’ Purple. This briefly stunned Lil’ Purple before she slowly got back up, and she cupped her hands together, allowing the moonlight to accumulate in her palms.

This is the Phoenix Heart Song!

Lil’ Purple raised her head and saw Lin Yun playing the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute on the roof, looking at her. As they looked at each other, Lin Yun smiled and shifted his gaze away as he continued to play the flute.

When he was done playing the Phoenix Heart Song, Lin Yun began to play the other songs that Lil’ Purple had taught him in the past. As he played, his music suddenly reached a whole new height.

“Saint King Tune…” Lil’ Purple was surprised as she looked at Lin Yun. Without her knowing it, Lin Yun reached such heights in the music dao. The Saint Tune was divided into Saint Lord, Great Saint, and Saint King Tune. Above it would be the Imperial Tune.

After Lin Yun played all the music that Lil’ Purple had taught him, he began to play the other ancient scores he learned at the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion: the Prairie Phoenix Fire, the Heavenly Mulberry Score, and Ni Chang Dress Song.

His music turned into silver threads that enveloped Lil’ Purple like a dress. When Lil’ Purple looked at the dress on her, a smile rose on her lips, and she floated over to Lin Yun.

“You remembered all the songs that I taught you. It looks like you’ve worked hard, you scumbag,” Lil’ Purple smiled and said in a disdainful tone.

“I naturally still remember.” Lin Yun put down the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and continued, “I still remember that the moon in the sky is still the same as today.”

“It’s only a crescent moon,” Lil’ Purple said.

“But it’s gorgeous, like your eyes,” Lin Yun smiled.

Lil’ Purple’s face blushed, and she recalled what she said before. She became bashful and flicked her finger against the back of Lin Yun’s hand.

“Ouch!” Lin Yun grimaced and rubbed the wound on his right hand. He raised his head to look at Lil’ Purple before they smiled.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Lass, since we already know that the Solar Lunar Divine Rune is in the Heavenly Dao Sect, we will be able to find it,” Lin Yun said. “Didn’t I also recover from my previous injuries?”

Lil’ Purple smiled, “I’m fine. I only feel a little empty in my heart.”

As she spoke, she ripped off the dress, and the dress dissipated into musical notes that drifed away.

“The Ni Chang Dress Song isn’t nice?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s nice, but I have a cape!” Lil’ Purple said and took out a purple blanket.

Lin Yun suddenly recalled it and said, “It’s a blanket.”

“Hmph. If I say it’s a cape, it’s a cape!”

It was easy to forget about happiness; only embarrassing moments would be remembered. Lin Yun naturally remembered. It was the blanket he put on her before, fearing she might catch a cold. But Lil’ Purple questioned him if he had seen an Ice Phoenix who froze to death.

But Lil’ Purple treated that blanket like a cape.

Despite having his embarrassing moments mentioned, Lin Yun felt great after seeing the smile on her face because the Lil’ Purple that he knew of had returned.

On the other hand, Lil’ Red grinned as it raised its head, wagging its tail around.

When dawn came, Lin Yun headed for the Contribution Hall while Lil’ Purple motivated herself and headed for the Nether Orchid Courtyard with Lil’ Red.

But when Lin Yun came out of the Indigo Thunder Peak, he instantly became the center of attention. After all, he became an influential figure within the Heavenly Dao Sect. He first caused a huge uproar during the conferring ceremony, causing three azure dragon sacred flames to appear. Then, he became the champion of the Di Group, not to mention that he was also a Great Saint’s disciple.

The sword that he used to defeat Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Lin Beitong further contributed to his fame even more. But since no one knew the name of that sword, they could only rely on their imagination and called it the Light of the Beginning.

This made many people regret that they weren’t able to witness it. Ye Qingtian only used one sword to defeat Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Lin Beitong before using a sword to shatter the entire stage. His achievement was already spreading throughout the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“That’s Ye Qingtian? The one who defeated Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Lin Beitong, becoming the champion of the Di Group?”

“Light of the Beginning… Is it really that powerful?”

“Absolutely. Thousands of people have witnessed it themselves. He easily defeated Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Lin Beitong with a flash of light.”

“Of course, it’s powerful. Didn’t you see how the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s face became black after examining Zhang Yue’s injuries?”

“I heard that Ye Qingtian had held back. Otherwise, Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Lin Beitong would’ve lost their lives.”

“How terrifying…”

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling when he heard the surrounding discussions. These people were really spot on, and that sword could be called the Light of the Beginning, to a certain degree.

Should he call the first form of the Sword of the Beginning, Light of the Beginning?

Lin Yun smiled because that sounded great, and he came to the Contribution Hall with a smile.

“Ye Qingtian is here!” An uproar broke out when Lin Yun appeared, and all the disciples who were exchanging resources at the Contribution Hall turned around.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re also here to exchange for resources? Why don’t we go together?” A person appeared, looking at Lin Yun with a smile. This person was Wang Yue of the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

“Sure.” Lin Yun nodded.

Wang Yue came forth and softly asked, “Ye Qingtian, can you tell me the name of that sword you used at the end? I promise that I won’t spread it around.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned after hearing what Wang Yue said before he laughed, “Light of the Beginning. Hahaha!”

After revealing the name, he ignored the dazed Wang Yue and walked towards the Contribution Hall.

Is it really called Light of the Beginning? Wang Yue was surprised because wasn’t that the name that the spectators gave it?
