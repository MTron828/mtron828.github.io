Chapter 379 - Moon Reflection

Blood slowly dripped from the hand Lin Yun used to wield his sword. As his hair fluttered in the wind, Lin Yun’s expression became grave. He was shocked because he never imagined that a droplet of water would be so powerful. The black-clothed man is also in the quasi-xiantian sword intent, so how was it so powerful?

“Here I come.” The black-clothed man smiled at Lin Yun. He spread his arms apart and soared into the sky. While he was in mid-air, he condensed his sword intent to the limit, which created a black shine. With a flicker, the black-clothed man appeared before Lin Yun and unleashed the black shine on him. His sword intent suddenly exploded like a volcano.

Lin Yun didn’t have the luxury of time to think about things and executed the Seven Profound Steps instantly to avoid the attack.

“Do you think you can escape? Cluster Gale!” The black-clothed man swung his sword out with a smile and a powerful gale charged out from his sword like a dragon.

Lin Yun landed on the water and counterattacked with a slash using Luminous Moon. The two powerful sword rays clashed together, which caused a huge explosion from the impact.

“You’re somewhat capable.” The black-clothed man smiled and he turned into a streak of light.

Lin Yun immediately raised his sword to defend himself while circulating the Iris Sword Sutra.

“Cold Frost!” But the attack that flowed like water suddenly exploded and sent Lin Yun flying away.

When Lin Yun fell down, he knew that he had to do something. He couldn’t afford to hand the initiative of this battle to the black-clothed man. Spreading his arms apart, Lin Yun soared into the sky like a golden crow. It was the Seven Profound Steps’ Golden Crow Wings.

“You can’t escape.” The black-clothed man’s gaze turned cold. He swung his sword and shot seven droplets of water out like cannons after infusing his sword intent into them.

Lin Yun pushed the Seven Profound Steps to the limits and took seven steps forward in mid-air. Producing seven afterimages with his movement technique, the afterimages swung their swords out and returned the seven droplets of water.

The black-clothed man dashed forward and easily dodged the water droplets. When the water droplets fell onto the lake, they instantly caused seven explosions on the surface of the water and raised seven geysers.

The seven geysers roared like dragons behind the black-clothed man. It was a shocking scene to behold, but the black-clothed man was calmly walking over to where Lin Yun would fall.

Still mid-air, Lin Yun was finally enraged because the black-clothed man was pushing it too far. He had used up all the momentum in the air and he couldn’t borrow any force to change his direction. Since that was the case, Lin Yun aimed his sword beneath him and dove down like a meteorite.

The Iris Sword Seal appeared on the back of Lin Yun’s hand and he flicked his fingers, unleashing nine violet sword rays at the black-clothed man.

This attack briefly surprised the black-clothed man. He took nine steps backwards and was forced into the geysers. After Lin Yun flicked his fingers, he slapped his palm on the water to halt his descent. Using the rebounding force, Lin Yun flipped in the air.

After Lin Yun stabilized his figure, he looked around and found that the black-clothed man was missing.

“You’ll ultimately fall!” A figure suddenly shot out from the lake beside Lin Yun.

When the water fell down, a cold ray also shot out of Lin Yun’s body. Although Lin Yun manifested the Dracophant War Armor at the critical moment, the sword still pierced through his shoulder and sent him flying a few hundred meters away.

When Lin Yun fell onto the ground, the biting pain coming from his shoulder was so intense that it burrowed into his bones. Lin Yun’s lips twitched because he finally knew how his enemies felt when he stabbed them. Looking at the black-clothed man, Lin Yun had a flash of despair on his face.

“Are you feeling despair? You’ve already done a great job lasting this long. You don’t have to blame yourself. After all, I’m your opponent…” The black-clothed man narrowed his eyes.

Lin Yun now knew why the tenth level was a legend. Those who came probably died here, but Lin Yun forced himself not to give up. He gradually calmed down and started to focus. Since this was a test, this meant that there was a way to get through it.

Since the white-clothed man said that he was waiting for him on the tenth level, this meant that there was a way to defeat this black-clothed man. Otherwise, the white-clothed man’s words would become meaningless.

“I do have a flaw, but you won’t be able to find it. So no matter what he said to you, it’s meaningless,” said the black-clothed man, he read Lin Yun’s mind once more. This further increased the pressure on Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was enraged by those words. But he soon thought of something and smiled while raising his brows, “Then what are you afraid of? If you’re as powerful as you claim, then I should be dead by now. I’m afraid that you’re not completely unscathed from my attacks, right? Let me guess how many attacks you took earlier… One? Two? Three?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Lin Yun said this while he observed the black-clothed man’s expression. Then, he smiled, “So it’s three. It looks like you’re not as invincible as you claimed. So why are you trying to hide the fact that you’re injured by shattering my confidence?”

“It doesn’t matter what you say because it won’t change anything,” smiled the black-clothed man.

“I’m afraid that I’ve already guessed your weakness. So it turns out that the tests of the previous nine levels were in preparation for this level. The white-clothed man already left behind your weakness in the nine levels.”

This time, the black-clothed man's face finally changed. His face turned dark and his voice became cold, “You’re trying to bluff me? You’re still a little too tender. You can die now!”

The black-clothed man regathered his sword aura. So it turns out that he really was hit by Lin Yun’s attacks and that he was just trying to buy time to recover. The moment he regathered his sword aura, he appeared before Lin Yun in the blink of an eye and stabbed his sword at Lin Yun’s injury. If this attack hit, the sword intent would tear apart Lin Yun’s wound.

He knew that Lin Yun’s physique was powerful, so he didn’t want to give Lin Yun the chance to draw out the battle. He was determined to claim Lin Yun’s life with this sword. But just when this sword was about to land on Lin Yun, Lin Yun’s aura suddenly fluctuated. The black-clothed man had clearly locked onto Lin Yun, but Lin Yun had suddenly disappeared.

However, the black-clothed man still stabbed his sword forward. When the black-clothed man’s sword exploded, it produced a blinding dazzle and Lin Yun’s figure appeared. The black-clothed man smiled when he saw Lin Yun, but his face soon changed. Because there were still nine afterimages.

“I’ve already said that I’ve found your weakness, which made me realize why I failed to hit him back then. Most importantly, I’m not someone who lies.” The nine afterimages overlapped together and Lin Yun stabbed his sword forward. When Lin Yun unleashed this attack, the sky turned dark. It was the other ultimate move from the Aquaselenic Sword, Moon Reflection.

Before the black-clothed man could react, Lin Yun’s afterimages overlapped and stabbed into the black-clothed man’s forehead.

“I should’ve believed you.” The black-clothed man suddenly smiled and he fell down.

Is this the end? Lin Yun felt heavily relieved and he looked at the shore. If he guessed correctly, he should have passed the test by now and the white-clothed man should be waiting for him in the palace.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun ignored his injuries and walked towards the palace. When he arrived at the shore, he strode towards the palace without any hesitation.

When he entered, he saw the white-clothed man seated on a white lotus at the center of the palace. This finally put joy on Lin Yun’s face. But just when he was about to step forth, he suddenly paused his footsteps.

He saw a terrifying wound on the white-clothed man’s forehead. It was the attack that Lin Yun had just unleashed at the black-clothed man. Thinking of the black-clothed man’s words, Lin Yun finally had fear on his face.

He’s the cloud while I’m the rain. This meant that they were both the same person. Lin Yun hesitated briefly before he stepped forward. When he did, the white-clothed man suddenly disappeared and an azure lotus slowly rose up.
