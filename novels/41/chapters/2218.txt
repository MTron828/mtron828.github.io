Chapter 2219 - Two VS One!

Lin Yun fell from the Blood Purgatory Mountain once more, making this his seventh time failing. It was miserable this time because he couldn’t even reach halfway up the mountain. As for the last few times, they were even worse because he was knocked back by the Dragon Origin Grea Saint whenever he reached the waist of the mountain.

“It looks like my junior brother is a little weak. It’s not good for men to be so weak,” Ye Guhan smiled at the foot of the mountain.

“Don’t talk about him like that. He can only adapt to it and should be able to adapt soon. After all, he’s Radiant’s most beloved disciple,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said.

Ye Guhan smiled, “How many times has he failed now? And yet you’re so confident?”

The Serene Dust Great Saint was unhappy, but she asked, “You don’t have to care about that. Why don’t you seal your sword intent and saint aura before competing with him?”

“I’ll decline,” Ye Guhan smiled embarrassedly.

“Shut up if you don’t dare, then!” The Serene Dust Great Saint rolled her eyes.

This made Ye Guhan bitterly smile because the treatment was different despite being a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint as well.

“Again!” Lin Yun stretched and wanted to give it another try. He had failed so many times, but he had started to adapt to five-times gravity. He took a deep breath and circulated the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. His Dragon’s Blood boiled and a golden dragon could be faintly seen.

As his blood boiled, the dragon aura he gave off became even more terrifying as his eyes became sharper, like a pair of dragon’s eyes. Very quickly, the five-times gravity alleviated, and the pressure on him was lifted. He landed before the Dragon Origin Great Saint in just a few minutes and smiled, “Master, we meet again.”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

But the Dragon Origin Great Saint opened his eyes with a cold flash. Seeing this, Lin Yun waved his hand and said, “Master, don’t! I’ll go down by myself.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint was stunned and smiled, “I really can’t get angry with you. Think well where you did wrong.”

Although he was smiling, he still gave a punch to Lin Yun’s chest. This made Lin Yun let out a groan. A Great Saint was bullying a Quasi-Saint like him, but he could do nothing about it. He wasn’t injured when he climbed the mountain; his injuries came from rolling down the mountain.

The pressure from Blood Purgatory Mountain was like a snowball that rumbled down. Since Lin Yun has experienced this multiple times, he squinted and seemed to have seen a person in crimson armor under pressure.

When Lin Yun threw his punch out, he shattered the person, but it swiftly converged and became even more massive.

As Lin Yun’s body began to sink, he kept throwing punches with his Dragon’s Blood boiling, clashing with the incoming pressure. When Lin Yun reached the foot of the mountain, the crimson-armored figure was over ten feet.

Azure Dragon Grasp!

Lin Yun pushed his palm forth as a crimson radiance formed into a thunderstorm vortex and a powerful suction force that dragged the crimson-armored figure over. He clenched his fist and shattered the incoming crimson-armored figure. After he was done, he breathed a sigh of relief and stood with his hands behind him.

Although he failed again, at least he didn’t suffer any injuries.

“That brat is a little handsome.” Ye Guhan’s eyes lit up.

“More handsome than you,” the Serene Dust Great Saint smiled.

“Haha.” Ye Guhan smiled and said nothing about it.

“What is Master testing me for?” Lin Yun stood in the same spot as he fell into deep thought. If it was to reach halfway up the mountain, he could accomplish it without difficulty. As long as he circulated the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, his Dragon’s Blood would boil with his dragon aura spreading out, and the pressure he felt would decrease.

“I got it!” Lin Yun stopped as he looked at the summit of the first mountain. He instantly understood what his master meant when he recalled what his master said about the mountain's summit being five times the gravity. That meant it should be fine for Lin Yun to reach halfway up the mountain, but it was impossible to reach the top.

“So I have to ignite my vitality.” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up as his thoughts became clear.

“Let’s give this a try…” Lin Yun raised his head, and his eyes flashed with more confidence.

The Azure Dragon could manipulate thunderstorms and he possessed the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. Even if his saint aura and sword intent were sealed, he should be able to control the thunderstorm. After all, that was an innate bloodline talent!

“Wind!” With a thought, a violent gale enveloped him. The gale was so powerful that an indigo air current could be visibly seen. Multiple small vortexes coiled around Lin Yun as he quickly walked over.

“Thunder!” Lightning flashed on his body as thunderclouds gathered in the sky, rumbling.

“Thunderstorm!” With a single thought, it looked like an Azure Dragon was in the clouds with lightning flashing. At this moment, Lin Yun could sense that his physique seemed to have formed a connection with the Azure Dragon Sovereign Constellation from beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven. “I see…”

In the past, he could only have this connection when using the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

“So to a certain degree, my physique can be considered the mould of a Sovereign Saint Artifact, and I can connect with that Sovereign Saint Artifact?” Lin Yun soon reached halfway up the mountain and saw the Dragon Origin Great Saint again.

“Not bad, you’ve finally figured it out.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint smiled as he got up and climbed the mountain.

Lin Yun didn’t take long to feel a terrifying pressure crushing down, and the thunderstorms around him felt like they would be ripped apart at any moment under the gravity. With no other choice, he circulated his vitality once more to increase his dragon’s aura before stabilizing himself.

Bearing ten times the gravity, Lin Yun gasped for breath and could sense his physique reaching a limit. Even if he had controlled the thunderstorms, he was struggling to hold on.

“This is just the beginning. The Azure Dragon Divine Physique has three phases: the Dragon’s Body, Dragon’s Soul, and Dragon’s Aura. Your Dragon’s Body is only at lesser mastery,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said. “If you want to face Saints, you must reach the pinnacle of the first phase, transforming your bones and meridians. The dragon bones are the Yang of the Dragon’s Body, while the meridians are the Yin of the Dragon’s Body. Yin and Yang must always exist in everything in the world. That is the same for divine physiques, especially acquired divine physiques like ours. You’re currently at the pinnacle of Dragon's Blood, so you have to transform your bones…”

“Let’s begin.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint dashed over while restricting his cultivation to the same level as Lin Yun’s. When they fought, Lin Yun soon reached his limit after ten moves.

“Master, I can’t hold on any longer,” Lin Yun helplessly yelled as he reached his limit. Fine cracks began to appear on his bones under ten times the pressure, and the cracks soon spread throughout his skeleton after just ten moves. If they continued to fight, Lin Yun’s skeleton would fall apart.

“Your Dragon’s Blood hasn’t reached the pinnacle. Since it hasn’t reached the pinnacle, how can your physique transform?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint said as he threw his punch over. Lin Yun’s bones shattered this time as he rolled down the mountain.

“Breathe like a dragon. The vitality can only reach the pinnacle as you breathe before transforming. This is how you train your physique, but you can give up if you can’t hold on any longer,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said with a resounding voice. Lin Yun soon fainted before he could even think about his words.

This made Ye Guhan widen his mouth with his lips twitching. He might have suggested this training, but he didn’t expect the Dragon Origin Great Saint to be so ruthless.

“Long Yun, aren’t you a little too ruthless?” The Serene Dust Great Saint felt so much heartache that she almost teared up. She removed the Azure Jade Purification Vase to treat Lin Yun’s injuries.

“Stop!” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint opened her eyes, and said, “He hasn’t reached his limit yet. Long Yun’s efforts will go down the drain if you move now.”

The Serene Dust Great Saint couldn’t bear to see Lin Yun in this state, but she ultimately endured it and sobbed, “Why does it have to be so tough on this child?”

When Lin Yun woke up, it had already been four hours. He could feel his entire body aching whenever he breathed. But the pain was torturous, and he was so exhausted that he didn’t have the strength to move. He briefly hesitated before he got back up, bearing the intense pain.

Breathe like a dragon? Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts as he closed his eyes.

“Don’t use your Blue Dragon Bone and breathe like me.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint’s voice resounded as he passed Lin Yun a secret breathing technique. Very quickly, Lin Yun gradually recovered from his injuries. Every breath became longer, and each breath could last a few minutes.

When Lin Yun took a deep breath, his body would rumble, his vitality boiling. He didn’t circulate the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, but the dragon aura he gave off was increasingly terrifying as he breathed. He soon sensed the existence of his vitality that circulated within his body like saint aura.

“This is really magical.” Lin Yun opened his eyes. He wasn’t in a hurry to climb the mountain, so he began to move around, and his blood began to flow throughout his body as he breathed.

With a glance, Lin Yun could see a visible vitality flowing into his right arm with surges of power exploding. When he threw his punch forth, an Azure Dragon’s roar echoed as space was shattered. When he took another breath, his vitality gathered onto his right foot as he soared to the sky like a dragon.

“I really haven’t reached my limit yet.” Lin Yun became excited as he felt a connection with heaven and earth whenever he breathed, and his body became agile. He only took an hour to reach the mountain's summit this time.

Lin Yun’s vitality peaked seven days later, and his bones finally transformed. He excitedly said, “Master, I have succeeded! Come again!”

“Not bad, but it’s getting late now,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said.

“We’re going to rest now?” Lin Yun doubted his eyes, but he had no opinion against it. After all, seven days of not resting was too exhausting for him, especially since his bones shattered several times and he fell down the mountain.

As the doubt in Lin Yun’s eyes disappeared, he smiled. In the end, his master was still concerned about him.

“It’s time for someone else to take over,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint smiled. The moment he finished, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Ye Guhan appeared with their swords in their hands.

“Junior Brother, you’ve performed well for the past few days,” Ye Guhan smiled.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched because there was no rest. It changed from one-on-one to two-on-one!
