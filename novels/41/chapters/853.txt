Chapter 854 - Two Months Approaching

Lin Yun circulated the Iris Sword Sutra. In the next second, the Iris Flower petals began to dance. Then, he circulated the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra, causing the origin energy of two cultivation techniques to course through his body.

Immediately, a terrifying azure-purple sword ray exploded from Lin Yun’s body. Powerful wind poured into the surroundings as lightning roared all around Lin Yun. As the boundless origin energy filled his body, it felt like he was about to explode.

Lin Yun pressed his finger against his thumb as his aura surged violently from the azure-purple radiance that enveloped him.

At this moment, boundless Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Aura spread out as lightning crackled in the sky and a gale blew past him.

Flicking Divine Finger!

After accumulating his strength, Lin Yun flicked his finger. A gorgeous scene unfolded as 120 Iris Flower petals interlocked. The flaming peak that Lin Yun had locked onto earlier was now drowned in hundreds of sword rays. It looked like a silver waterfall was enveloping the mountain as it was being turned into dust.

When the sword rays dissipated, only two peaks were left. Lin Yun couldn’t utter a single word when saw this terrifying scene. He never imagined that he would level an entire mountain with a flick of his finger.

Then, he recalled what was recorded in the Flicking Divine Finger. Upon reaching a high level, one could even cut down a star with a single flick. In the past, he thought that it was an exaggeration, but now it seemed possible.

At this moment, Lin Yun had exhausted nearly all of his origin energy. Beads of sweat fell from his forehead as he felt quite dizzy.

“That was a bit exhausting. I have to tweak it a little or else I’ll be helpless after unleashing it.” Lin Yun smiled to himself after he took everything in. Then, he circulated the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra, which summoned the Azure Firmament Tree and a tornado. With a simple thought, lightning began to appear in the tornado. From afar, it looked like Lin Yun had a purple tornado.

Slowly, Lin Yun unleashed his spiritual sword intent into the tornado. At this moment, the tornado felt like a sharp sword.

“Go!” Lin Yun barked. As the lightning tornado roared, it travelled a few thousand meters in a split second with unimaginable speed.

Another three days passed and Lin Yun finally consolidated the sword sutra in the sixth stage. At the same time, he also made some improvements in his thundercloud intent.

“It’s time to practice the Azure Firmament Thirteen Swords.” Lin Yun rested briefly before taking out the ancient book.

The first three stages of the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra were for the foundation while the power would be revealed in the fourth through sixth stages. The seventh to ninth forms could be called the ultimate moves since each one had unimaginable power. As for the tenth to twelfth forms, they were the killing moves while the thirteenth form was described as a forbidden move.

Lin Yun’s talent in the path of the sword was monstrous and no one in the Profound Amber Realm could compare to him. With his talent, he managed to reach the sixth stage in the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. When he read through the book again, he realized that the sword technique was tough. However, learning the ultimate attacks shouldn’t be too difficult for him.

“Azure Firmament Flash!” After spending four hours comprehending the technique, Lin Yun opened his eyes and soared into the sky. He drew his sword and entered the forbidden zone while the Azure Firmament Tree hovered behind him. Then, the tree turned into a sword ray that instantly suppressed the surrounding flames and sliced through them like butter. Lin Yun didn’t even use his spiritual sword intent with this attack.

“What destructive capabilities!” Lin Yun was shocked because he had experienced the forbidden zone before. If he didn’t use his spiritual sword intent, entering the forbidden zone with his Azure Dragon Battle Physique would result in death. But now, he actually suppressed the surging flames with one sword.

“Wind Congealing Azure Wood!” Before the flames could sweep out again, Lin Yun unleashed his second sword. Wisps of sword aura spread out from the Azure Firmament Tree that created ten terrifying ravines on the ground. With the ravines, the forbidden zone was nearly destroyed.

“Aura Shattering Firmament!” Lin Yun swung his sword for the third time, tearing the clouds in two. The sword ray sliced a flaming peak that was 1,000 meters away. Furthermore, the cut was smooth and clear.

“These three forms are just for the foundation, but their power already surpasses the Overlord Sword. However, it’s still lacking compared to the Supreme Dominance and Terranean Destruction. It will grow in the fourth and sixth forms though.” The sword technique was powerful, but Lin Yun still wasn’t very satisfied. He wasn’t proficient in the forms and he also didn’t use them with his spiritual sword intent.

However, he had plenty of time to get to a satisfactory level. Lin Yun intended to grasp the fourth, fifth, and sixth forms before heading to the Profound Amber Mountain. If possible, he also wanted to grap at least one of the ultimate moves.

Meanwhile, at the Indigomoon Elysium, Yu Haotian had finally recovered from his injuries. However, the entire sect had worried faces. Yu Haotian was far from his peak state although he had recovered from his injuries. Lin Yun’s punch was too ruthless, leaving Yu Haotian even weaker than before the banquet. It was practically futile for him to obtain a quota in this state.

“Let him accept the inheritance. Otherwise, he’ll be completely crippled,” said an elder as he looked at the Indigomoon Elysium’s sect master.

“Isn’t it too dangerous?”

“Yu Haotian might be in the Heavenly Soul Realm, but he hasn’t gone through the tribulation. He hasn’t even unlocked his first soul, not to mention that he just recovered from his injuries. If he fails, the next time the inheritance is open will be a millennium from now.”

“But if he doesn’t accept the inheritance, he won't even be qualified to enter the Heavenly Path.”

“We should inquire with the Demonic Envoy about it.” The elders discussed it before they started cursing Lin Yun. It was all Lin Yun’s fault. Without Lin Yun, Yu Haotian would be the champion and would refine the dragon aura. It would have been even better since he had such a great harvest in the Dragoncloud Treasury.

Right at this moment, the hall opened with an elder walking in. In the next second, everyone became respectful, “Greetings, Demonic Envoy!”

The Demonic Envoy was also Qing Ruoyou’s father who was said to be an empyrean. Behind him stood Qing Ruoyou and Yu Haotian. The elder spoke, “No need to fight anymore. The altar will be opened tonight and Haotian will accept the inheritance. As for the results, it will depend on his fortune. After all, he has no choice after losing to Lin Yun.”

Damn it! Yu Haotian instantly felt his chest aching the moment he heard that name. The humiliation he suffered in the banquet allowed him to undergo a transformation. Furthermore, no one in the hall spoke another word since the Demonic Envoy already made his decision.

Yu Haotian had recovered from his injuries with a chance to summon the Demonic Spirit. But Zhao Wuji, who was also injured by Lin Yun, wasn't as lucky. He was crippled even though the Violet Thunder Sect used countless spiritual elixirs and even invited the best spiritualist.

With the deadline fast approaching, the Violet Thunder Sect had to give up. Even if they managed to save Zhao Wuji now, his strength would be greatly affected. It was practically impossible for him to obtain the qualification into the Heavenly Path, so it would be a waste to use more resources.

The other geniuses in the top ten were all cultivating bitterly because they knew that it would be a tough fight against the geniuses from other domains. However, they still had to give it their all because this was a rare opportunity for them. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

If they could obtain something, it would be a great fortune to them. After all, they could join a powerful sect in Kunlun Realm.
