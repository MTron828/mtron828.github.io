Chapter 806 - Northern Snow Manor, Nangong Wanyu!

After they finished showing respect, Nangong Wanyu slowly adjusted his hand under the sword hilt. His eyes flashed sharply as he looked at Lin Yun. From this moment onwards, the only things that existed were his sword and Lin Yun. Secretly, he felt a lot of pressure from Lin Yun. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Nangong Wanyu knew that even though Lin Yun noticed Li Mubai’s flaw, it wasn’t an easy matter to defeat Li Mubai. From this, he knew that Lin Yun was strong, much stronger than what he had shown so far. In fact, he knew that Lin Yun still had a few trump cards. Otherwise, there was no way Lin Yun would be calm and collected. Unfortunately for Lin Yun, Nangong Wanyu was determined to win no matter what.

“Autumn Water!” Nangong Wanyu was suddenly a hundred meters away from Lin Yun. Swinging his sword, the air rippled like water as the sword shined with a cold light.

The three kings were surprised when they saw this. Although they weren’t swordsmen, they could still feel the intent behind Nangong Wanyu’s sword. Nangong Wanyu had completely fused his frost sword intent into his sword technique. This sword technique was named Autumn Water, so the frost intent wasn’t so obvious.

Lin Yun had no change on his face as he swung the Flower Burial Sword quickly. His sword was also like the dreamy Autumn Water as it exploded with dazzling radiance. When the Flower Burial sword clashed with the Flying Snow sword, huge sparks covered the stage.

Lin Yun and Nangong Wanyu pushed their sword intent to the limit, filling the air with a noisy buzz. Every single sword ring sent goosebumps through everyone’s body.

“It’s cold! Am I mistaken? The barrier on the stage should’ve isolated their sword intent.”

“There are many cultivators who used swords in the banquet, but not many of them can be called swordsmen. There’s no question that Lin Yun and Nangong Wanyu are top-tier swordsmen. There’s no way their clash would cause such a commotion if they weren’t.” The collision between Lin Yun and Nangong Wanyu caused a huge commotion as their sword rays flew around.

“Listening Wind!” Not being able to gain the advantage even after dozens of moves, Nangong Wanyu turned around and stabbed his sword out. Because of his sword aura, the invisible wind became visible.

The wind moved like it had life, which was bizarre to the crowd. Suddenly, the wind shattered and was pierced by Nangong Wanyu’s sword ray. The instant this happened, a violent blizzard filled the air.

“Moon Reflection!” When the wind shattered, Lin Yun quickly retaliated and spread his arms apart with a pair of golden wings. Simultaneously, he stabbed his sword, which threw the entire space into chaos. Compared to Nangong Wanyu’s attack, Lin Yun’s attack seemed more exquisite.

Nangong Wanyu’s face changed as he stabbed his sword out and retreated. With the flash of Lin Yun’s sword ray, only a few strands of Nangong Wanyu’s hair were cut along with a few drops of blood that came from his face.

He’s quick. If I was facing Li Mubai, he would’ve died several times already. Lin Yun muttered inwardly. He only managed to cut several strands of Nangong Wanyu’s hair along while leaving a shallow wound on his face.

Nangong Wanyu touched the shallow wound on his face and smiled, “That’s a fast sword. But being fast isn’t good enough. I’m still warming up.”

“Go ahead and attack,” replied Lin Yun.

The two were decisive. After they were done probing each other, they pushed their aura to the limit. In the next second, Nangong Wanyu and Lin Yun both disappeared.

A shockingly loud noise rang out on the stage as two sword rays clashed. A purple sword ray and a cold sword ray streaked across the stage, creating a massive shockwave. The collision between Flying Snow and Flower Burial created multiple explosions that made the stage tremble violently.

Before the audience could respond, another powerful explosion rang out, which caused some people to throw up blood.

“Is this what happens when true geniuses face each other?” The audience watched the battle with alarm on their faces. After all, the collisions between the swords were dangerous.

The terrifying soundwave spread out, causing violent waves on the lake and wind that blew on everyone’s faces. Some people even discovered that they were completely immobilized by the wind. With how large the Nine Dragon Lake was, the intensity of the fight was incredible.

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as his sword intent continued to increase. He then pushed the Overlord Sword to the limit. In a split second, his immense sword aura covered the lake.

Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slash!

The Flower Burial Sword in Lin Yun’s hand trembled as densely packed lightning flew out. The shockwave from his attack caused a violent fluctuation on the lake. Facing Nangong Wanyu, Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless. He combined the Overlord Sword with the Aquaselenic Sword to form a new sword aura, giving off a massive and illusory aura.

“You’re strong.” Nangong Wanyu’s eyes flickered. He had to admit that Lin Yun’s attainment in his sword techniques was terrifying. He had seen Lin Yun perform the overlord sword several times, so he had prepared many ways to deal with it. However, he never imagined that Lin Yun’s sword technique would suddenly change.

“Falling Flower!” Nangong Wanyu’s sword flew around and his sword rays containing frost sword intent would create huge snowflakes. However, the snowflakes would shatter and turn into powerful blizzards.

After swinging his sword ten times, the storm around Nangong Wanyu rained down even more snowflakes.

Overlord Sword—Solar Slash!

Just when Nangong Wanyu’s attack was about to reach Lin Yun, a pair of wings unfolded next to him as he shot into the sky. Then, his sword exploded with the dazzling brilliance of a bright sun.

This made Nangong Wanyu’s face change and he quickly moved to avoid the attack. Unfortunately for him, Lin Yun’s attack destroyed all the snowflakes and created a huge ravine on the ground. Additionally, Lin Yun’s attack split the lake apart, forming two gigantic walls.

When the walls of the lake fell down, two gigantic waves collided and created a huge wave three thousand meters high. If Nangong Wanyu didn’t dodge this attack, he would be in trouble.

Everyone looked at Lin Yun with surprise in their eyes because Lin Yun’s attainment in the way of the sword was terrifying. After all, Lin Yun was only using his sword intent. Not only did he withstand Nangong Wanyu’s frost sword intent, he even managed to counterattack.

Nangong Wanyu was surprised when he looked at the terrifying ravine on the stage. He looked at Lin Yun and said, “You have pushed your overlord sword to the manifestation stage. But Brother Lin, aren’t you looking down on me? Do you really want to fight me with these means alone? I’m Nangong Wanyu of the Northern Snow Manor, bring out your true strength!”

Nangong Wanyu’s aura skyrocketed as his origin energy boiled like the ocean above an underwater volcano. In the blink of an eye, his aura reached a shocking level and a powerful chill enveloped the entire stage.

The ground was instantly sealed in ice as Nangong Wanyu’s eyes flickered coldly. The combination of his frost intent and sword intent was much stronger than before. This caught Lin Yun by surprise as he was sent flying by the chilling aura.

At this moment, Nangong Wanyu’s aura was comparable to a Heavenly Soul Realm expert. Everyone’s heart throbbed as the frost sword intent reached new heights. After all, it even managed to push Lin Yun backwards.
