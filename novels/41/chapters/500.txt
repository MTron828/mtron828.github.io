Chapter 501 - Promise

When Lin Yun jumped, the ten Indigoflame Goldlotuses released a dazzling radiance. In the next second, the golden radiance enveloped Lin Yun. Earlier, someone tried to snatch the Indigoflame Goldlotuses amid the chaos, but they were incinerated to ashes before they could even get close.

So when all ten of the Indigoflame Goldlotuses bloomed, the aura coming from them was strong. Pan Yue and the rest who struggled to get back on their feet were suddenly filled with anticipation as they looked at the Indigoflame Goldlotuses. They were looking forward to Lin Yun’s death.

After all, he was trying to do the impossible. It wouldn’t be easy for Lin Yun to bear the flames from the ten Indigoflame Goldlotuses. At the same time, the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples became nervous. Lin Yun had done so much and he was just half a step away from the Indigoflame Goldlotuses. So it would be a pity if he failed.

“Big Brother Lin, you have to succeed,” muttered Bai Yi nervously. Liu Yunyan’s eyes were also filled with anticipation. She never expected that Lin Yun would give her such a huge surprise. As long as Lin Yun obtained the Indigoflame Goldlotuses, she would be able to become a core disciple.

Sensing all the gazes on him, Lin Yun smiled as he muttered to himself, “I’m afraid many people want me to die under these flames, but you guys are destined to be disappointed!”

In the name of my sword, bloom!

Lin Yun unleashed the Iris Sword Sutra’s secret move, Dazzling Moment. The outline of an Iris Flower appeared behind him and when it slowly revolved, Lin Yun’s aura began to surge.

“Break!” Lin Yun barked as he swung the Flower Burial Sword over. The torrential flames were cut into two by his sword before eventually crumbling and dissipating.

“This…” Pan Yue and everyone else were shocked by this scene. Lin Yun actually held back against them. Just how powerful was he? The thought of it alone made them feel disappointed. It felt as if there was a boulder on their chest. They might be heavily injured, but that didn’t mean that they were completely helpless. They still had their own trump cards that they could use to protect their lives at critical moments.

This was also the reason why Lin Yun didn’t kill them. After all, he wasn’t strong enough to ignore those trump cards. They were lesser Yin stage cultivators, so even though his life wouldn’t be threatened, it didn’t mean that he wouldn’t be injured. There was no need for him to take it to the extreme.

But he knew that they weren’t reluctant to accept their loss. If it wasn’t for the fact that they were heavily injured by Lin Yun, they might take the risk. However, when they saw how Lin Yun cut the flames into two, they instantly dispelled their thoughts. Lin Yun was destined to obtain those Indigoflame Goldlotuses.

At the same time, the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples all felt relieved. Lin Yun sheathed his sword and grabbed the ten lotuses. Honestly speaking, he wouldn’t be injured by the flames even if he didn’t use Dazzling Moment. But he had a cautious personality and he didn’t want to let his guard down at such a critical moment.

When he landed on the surface of the lake, the ten lotuses were right in front of his eyes. He could feel his heart beating wildly because those lotuses signified the Violet Palace Realm. With the lotuses, he could make a breakthrough without any accidents.

But just when he was about to collect the lotuses, the surface of the lake suddenly exploded and a terrifying aura was unleashed.

“What’s going on?” Everyone was stunned by this sudden accident as they all stopped what they were doing. The aura coming from the crack on the lake made them feel death. No one dared to make a move.

It didn’t take long for an indigo bolt of lightning to descend from the sky, instantly causing a huge wave as geysers shot upwards. The commotion was so huge that the previous phenomenon created by the lotuses was pale in comparison.

In the next second, indigo spears shot into the sky from those geysers. Just the aura of the spears alone left many people heavily injured, especially the unfortunate ones. As they yelled out in pain, a colossal being slowly appeared on the surface of the lake. A terrifying beast broke through the surface as its violent aura instantly covered the entire lake.

“It’s the Indigo Thunderpython!”

“Run! It’s that overlord demonic beast!” Many people began to panic as they started running. Everyone knew that there was a greater Yin stage overlord demonic beast sleeping at the bottom of the lake. But it had been centuries since the Indigo Thunderpython made its appearance that many people had forgotten about it. But they never imagined that it would show up at this moment.

“Hehe, that brat must have woken the Indigo Thunderpython.”

“That must be right. It would be weird if this demonic beast wasn’t alarmed by the previous commotion.”

“Haha, Flower Burial. In the end, his effort was all for naught. I don’t believe that he dares to fight the Indigo Thunderpython for the lotuses.” Those who were already feeling despair about the lotuses began to laugh. Since they couldn’t get any lotuses, they were happy to see Lin Yun also fail to get some

“Let’s go!” No one dared to stay any longer as they started running for their lives.

Lin Yun’s face was unsightly because he was only one step away from the lotuses. But he didn’t dare to take a step forward because the demonic beast was staring at him with its cold pupils. He knew that the demonic beast would attack if he dared to move.

Damn it! This meant that all his effort would go down the drain. Given Lin Yun’s personality, he couldn’t accept his fate. However, the Indigo Thunderpython was too strong and it was a lot stronger than the greater Yin stage wandering cultivator he fought in the past. Even ten of that wandering cultivator couldn’t fight with this demonic beast.

“Lin Yun, let’s go!” yelled Liu Yunyan.

Lin Yun no longer dwelt on it, and he left quickly. Just when he moved, a purple lightning spear shot out from the place he was standing previously.

Lin Yun turned around with his face ugly. He knew that he would have to take that spear head-on if he was any later. It was all thanks to Liu Yunyan’s reminder that he was saved. In the end, he was still too greedy. He had forgotten that he had to leave when the time was right.

“What are you thinking about? Let’s go,” reprimanded Liu Yunyan when she came before Lin Yun. Her words made Lin Yun feel a warmth in his heart. Despite the fact that he didn’t have a good relationship with this woman, she could still be trusted at such a critical moment.

“Thanks,” replied Lin Yun.

“It’s fine. Let’s go,” smiled Liu Yunyan. But when she looked at the lotuses, she couldn’t help feeling sad. She was just a step away, so her feelings were understandable. She knew that Lin Yun couldn’t be blamed for it. If it wasn’t for Lin Yun, she wouldn’t even have the qualification to fight for the lotuses.

Looking at the expression on her face, Lin Yun suddenly spoke out after a brief dilemma, “Liu Yunyan, you really need the lotuses, right? The status as a core disciple must be important to you.”

“What are you talking about at this moment? Let’s go!” replied Liu Yunyan. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“You go first!” Lin Yun gave Liu Yunyan a shove before she could even respond.

“Hey!” When Liu Yunyan reacted, she was already sent a distance away. When she turned around, Lin Yun had already turned around to face the demonic beast.

Lin Yun didn’t want to see a sad woman, plus he would do his best to fulfill his promise. In that split second, Liu Yunyan’s desire for the lotuses and helplessness moved Lin Yun.

“My things aren’t that easy to snatch. It doesn’tmatter who you are!” Lin Yun looked firm as he stared at the Indigo Thunderpython.

He then executed the Seven Profound Steps and soared into the sky, charging at the Indigoflame Goldlotuses. Many people turned around at this moment and they were frightened that Lin Yun actually went back.
