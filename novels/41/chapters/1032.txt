Chapter 1033 - Sun and Moon Fusion

The Divine Blood Fruit was extremely precious. As Pei Xue continued to share more information about the Divine Blood Fruit and Yue Weiwei’s conflict, Lin Yun understood what was going on.

Lin Yun thought about many things. Pei Xue felt that Yue Weiwei was safe and that the three war realms couldn’t capture her. However, he didn’t believe it and had already made plans for the worst case scenario. He knew that he wasn’t strong enough to help, but that wouldn’t stop him. With his sky sword intent now at greater mastery, it was time for him to practice the Divine Solar Lunar Fist.

Lin Yun had witnessed the foundation of the war realms in the Yellow Sandy Plain. Granted, he didn’t see the Realm Sons. If the realm sons appeared, his fight would have been even more terrifying. Suddenly, Lin Yun thought about something and his gaze fell onto Pei Xue, “Do you also come from the Kunlun Realm like Yue Weiwei?”

Since Pei Xue could obtain the Divine Blood Fruit, her origin wasn’t simple. Pei Xue didn’t hide it and replied, “Not only me, but many people from Kunlun Realm have descended onto the Heavenly Path. The competition over the Divine Blood Fruit is more brutal than you think. There are only three Divine Blood Fruits and each one is obtained through blood.”

“This means that there are many people from the Kunlun Realm in the Heavenly Path?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right.”

“Will they also participate in the final battle?

“Maybe, but they might not be stronger than you. After all, not every genius from Kunlun Realm is strong. Honestly, the birth of an extraordinary talent like you would attract many people’s attention if you were born in Kunlun Realm. But geniuses on your level wouldn’t take the risk to descend for the Heavenly Path,” replied Pei Xue.

“What about Yue Weiwei?” Lin Yun asked with a grave expression.

“She’s not the same. She seems to have sealed her genuine strength and descended onto a lower realm before coming to the Heavenly Path. It’s a complicated method that minimizes the risk. Her attachment to the Divine Blood Fruit is shocking. But, I don’t think she’s doing it for a supreme expert.” Pei Xue shared her speculation and continued, “She might need the Divine Blood Fruit for herself.”

Lin Yun had many thoughts, but he couldn’t confirm his speculations. He desperately wanted to focus on increasing his strength.

“Since you’re fine now, do you want to take a look around Four Phase City?” Pei Xue asked. “ Four Phase City is extremely busy from all the geniuses here. Plus, there’s the Heavenly Path Ranking.”

Lin Yun’s heart shook when he heard that. “What’s my position on the Heavenly Path Ranking?”

There were two months until the final battle and there were many means to shine brightly. Lin Yun was also curious about what his ranking was so he could make the appropriate preparations. Pei Xue smiled awkwardly, “You’re not on it.”

Lin Yun was stunned when he heard that. He wasn’t on it? Even the likes of Luo Chen were on the ranking, so why wasn’t he?

Noticing Lin Yun’s expression, Pei Xue replied, “Only those in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm will make it onto the ranking. You have to reach the fourth soul before the Heavenly Path comes to an end or you won’t be qualified for the final battle...”

When Pei Xue mentioned it, Lin Yun recalled that issue. In the beginning, the Heavenly Path Mirror would only reflect the names of those in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. But now, the threshold has risen to the fourth soul.

“I have to go into seclusion for a few days,” said Lin Yun.

“You don’t even want to take a look at the ranking?” Pei Xue locked her brows together because she wanted to take a stroll through the city with Lin Yun. After all, this was the calm before the storm.

“Let’s wait for a few days,” said Lin Yun. He naturally had to take a look at the ranking to figure out his opponents.

“Alright. Remember to make a breakthrough quickly because those on the ranking will have a chance to bask in the Saint Spirit Lake. Those who bask in the lake will undergo a transformation with a great boost in their strength. This is the last opportunity before the final battle,” reminded Lin Yun.

“Saint Spirit Lake? I won’t miss it,” smiled Lin Yun. He was currently in the pinnacle third soul Heavenly Soul Realm and could make a breakthrough if he wanted. But he wasn’t in a hurry. He had benefited greatly in the battle at the Yellow Sandy Plain, especially his sword intent and the holy spirit martial technique. He would put his enlightenments towards his strength or else his enlightenments would go to waste.

After he finished his talk with Pei Xue, Lin Yun went to the field in the courtyard. There was a spiritual array in the courtyard so no one would know of the commotion Lin Yun caused. He could cultivate in peace.

Lin Yun started by recalling his battle with the generals. He remembered the feeling of his sky sword intent touching greater mastery. Now, Lin Yun could vaguely sense that his sky sword intent wasn’t far from greater mastery. A brief moment later, Lin Yun opened his eyes, “I should give it a try and make a breakthrough in my sky sword intent…”

Waving his hand, Lin Yun retrieved his sword box as boundless sword intent descended from the sky and enveloped him. When he swung his sword out, he released a dazzling sword ray that could pierce through the sky. It was a miraculous feeling that gave Lin Yun a blazing sensation on his forehead.

There seemed to be a boundless power in the center of his brow that was trying to break through a restriction. Half an hour later, Lin Yun stopped as joy filled his face, “Indeed, my sky sword intent is close to greater mastery. I’ll be able to tear the sky apart with my sword intent.”

Sky sword intent was terrifying, which was why Lin Yun was invincible in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to face the seven heads on the Azure Dragon Ranking. The moment he reached greater mastery, the power of his sky sword intent would undergo a drastic transformation. Since there were only two months left, he had to work hard.

Two days later, the sky turned dark as an oppressive aura enveloped the courtyard. Pei Xue opened the window in her room as she squinted at the dazzling light from the courtyard.

The light came from Lin Yun’s sword ray. It was so dazzling that Pei Xue could barely open her eyes. In contrast to the light, the surroundings were plunged into darkness. After a long while later, Pei Xue’s heart began to throb as she exclaimed, “Devour!”

Lin Yun’s sword was devouring all the light in the world. At this moment, Lin Yun moved and began to practice a form from a sword technique. As his figure moved, the surroundings began to spin as torrential pressure crashed down.

At this moment, he was one with his sword. His sky sword intent had genuinely reached greater mastery. Anyone that faced him would feel the immense aura of his sky sword intent. If he faced someone who had a weak foundation and martial intent, he could probably kill them with a single glance.

Pei Xue fell silent because many swordsmen couldn’t even grasp sky sword intent. It was amazing that Lin Yun actually improved it to greater mastery. In the attainments of sword intent, Lin Yun had surpassed many geniuses in Kunlun Realm. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, halos of light emitted out from him. Instantly, his suppressive aura disappeared. As strands of black mist leaked out of Lin Yun, he opened his eyes and let out a long sigh.

His sword intent had reached greater mastery, so the poison from the Ancient Demon Seal Array was completely dispelled. When he touched his forehead, he could feel the heat coming from his forehead. There were rumors that one could open a sword sea within their forehead after the sword intent reached the fourth grade.

Initially, it was far away, but he wasn’t that far from it anymore. Lowering the sword in his hand, Lin Yun muttered, “If I encounter the Ancient Demon Seal Array again, I’ll be able to face it easily. I might even be able to kill fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts.”

Lin Yun sheathed his sword and sensed the great boost in his strength. The fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm wasn’t weak by any means, so Lin Yun was being arrogant. After all, there was a huge difference between having five aura oceans and three aura oceans.

“The Realm Sons aren’t ordinary and they’re most likely in the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. They will obviously have a saint rune engraved in their aura oceans, so they might be able to withstand the power of my sky sword intent…” Even with his sky sword intent reaching such a powerful height, Lin Yun could accurately estimate his opponents.

He had to start practicing the Divine Solar Lunar Fist to reinforce his invincible confidence. As long as he grasped a genuine holy spirit martial technique, Lin Yun would feel relieved.

Combining the holy spirit martial technique and sky sword intent would completely transform him. Lin Yun would have no reason to be scared of the Realm Sons.

Gently tapping his interspatial pouch, Lin Yun took out the jade slips belonging to the Divine Glorysun Fist and Divine Glorymoon Fist. He had to combine them to form the complete holy spirit martial technique.

Lin Yun’s heart began to throb at this moment because he had waited for a long time. But a holy spirit martial technique was terrifying and he would lose his life if he wasn’t careful. Lin Yun had been cautious up to this point, so he didn’t dare to merge them together until now. He was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to control himself if he merged the techniques too soon.

He had waited for a long time and knew that this was the right moment. Lin Yun had already reached the manifestation stage in the Divine Glorysun Fist and Divine Glorymoon Fist, so he basically had two imperial fortune martial techniques.

“Combine!” Lin Yun muttered. The two jade slips began to shine as they revolved around him. They slowly merged together to form a completely new jade slip that flickered with crimson light.
