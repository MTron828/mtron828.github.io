Chapter 1699 – Celestial Dance (1)

Mu Xueling brought Lin Yun to the summit of the snowy mountain without saying a word. The snowy mountain was massive, and the summit was a huge platform with falling snow.

“This is a Saint Mountain!” Lin Yun instantly recognized the snowy mountain when he landed on the ground. This was the oldest spiritual mountain out of Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s thirty-six mountains. Although it wasn’t as ancient as the Sword Sect’s Saint Mountain, it still had a saint vein. So it could be called a Saint Mountain.

A Saint Mountain was generally a forbidden zone of a sect, and even Lin Yun couldn’t ascend the Saint Mountain in the Sword Sect without his master’s summons.

Following behind Mu Xueling, they both came to a stop before a distant lake. That was this snowy mountain’s Saint Lake, and a woman dressed in a red dress could be faintly seen dancing in the snow.

That person had a gorgeous figure, and even from so far away, with snow hindering his vision, he could tell that this was a peerless beauty. At this moment, Lin Yun understood who the Ni Chang Dress Song was meant for.

“I believe this must be Her Highness, the Profound Fairy.” Lin Yun said, and he executed the Divine Dragon Eyes. He wanted to see the appearance of this person, but because of the intense blizzard and because they were ten miles apart, it was hard for him to see her appearance with his naked eyes.

But when he executed the Divine Dragon Eyes, his vision was blurred by a fog, which also turned into multiple bubbles. Each bubble was shrouded in a powerful saint light, and Lin Yun couldn’t see through the bubbles no matter how he executed the Divine Dragon Eyes. That was the law of saint dao.

Switching off the Divine Dragon Eyes, Lin Yun turned to look at Mu Xueling and knew that it must have been done by her. As someone who had taken one foot into the Saint Path, it wasn’t surprising that she could grasp the law of saint dao, which also meant that this Saint Elder was really terrifying. But he was confident that he could break through the law of saint dao if he used the Aurora Dragon Eyes, but there was no need for that.

“What are you trying to do? Didn’t I warn you not to try and peek at the Profound Fairy?” Mu Xueling asked with enmity rising in her pupils.

Lin Yun instantly sensed a wisp of killing intent, and he knew the Saint Elder had misunderstood him. After all, some techniques of the evil path could see through fog and women’s clothes. In truth, the Divine Dragon Eyes also had such an effect, it’s just that he had never executed it before.

“I just want to look at the appearance of the Profound Fairy, don’t misunderstand me.” Lin Yun explained.

“I know. Otherwise, you’d already be a dead person now.” said Mu Xueling.

“Not even just a glance?”

“Not even just a glance.” Mu Xueling said. “I’m saying this for your sake. The Profound Fairy’s beauty is peerless, and it’s best for you not to take a look at her. I’m afraid that you’ll fall for her.”

“How beautiful is she? Is she as beautiful as you?” Lin Yun smiled.

Mu Xueling was briefly stunned. She lowered his head and briefly pondered before saying, “As beautiful as me.”

Lin Yun nearly couldn’t hold back his laughter, and it was pretty adorable to see the cold Saint Elder saying that with a straight face.

“What are you laughing at?” Mu Xueling asked.

“Nothing. Saint Elder, you should need my help by bringing me here, right? Go on.” Lin Yun winked.

“The Profound Fairy is practicing the Nine Heavenly Profound Dance, but she’s stuck at the third portion. So I hope that you can use the Ni Chang Dress Song to help her make a breakthrough.” Mu Xueling nodded.

“Don’t you also know how to play the Ni Chang Dress Song?” Lin Yun asked.

“‘It has to be played by a man. The dress is created by a man for his loved one, and the Nine Heavenly Profound Fairy can only wear this dress.” Mu Xueling explained.

“Why me?” Lin Yun asked.

“Are you asking me to praise you?” Mu Xueling turned to look at Lin Yun. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Lin Yun was briefly stunned upon hearing that before he awkwardly smiled, “I got it.”

“You have to manifest a dress with your song for the Profound Fairy, and it needs to be enveloped in nine colors, created from the clouds within ten thousand miles in radius. It needs to be light as snowflakes and feathers, and it also needs an ancient rhythm. You must treat it as if you’re doing it for your beloved.” Mu Xueling said.

After a brief pause, Mu Xueling continued, “But you can’t fall for her, nor can you have any improper thoughts.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitched, and he said, “Aren’t you making things difficult for me on purpose?”

“I’m not trying to make things difficult for you. The Profound Fairy has a unique identity, and her father is someone that not many people in this world can provoke, not to mention that he’s known for having a foul temper…” Mu Xueling turned to Lin Yun, and she continued, “Her father isn’t someone you can provoke.”

Rubbing his nose, Lin Yun said, “I have no thoughts of provoking him. But it’s hard if you ask me to treat her as my beloved, and I can’t have any improper thoughts. I might not be able to do it.”

“Eighteen Profound Saint Pellets, and you don’t have to take part in the final test. I’ll just immediately give you the quota to the Nirvana Banquet.” Mu Xueling said.

“Then let me take a look at her. I have to know at least what she looks like. If I don’t even know her appearance, how can you expect me to weave the dress for her?” Lin Yun asked.

“Why not?” Mu Xueling asked.

With a smile, Lin Yun explained, “White clouds, snowflakes, ancient rhythm, and celestial aura. They’re all beautiful, but they’re also fake at the same time. If I have to overlap them, no matter how beautiful the dress is, the dress that I weaved will look fake in the eyes of others.”

“Go on.” Light shone from the depths of Mu Xueling’s pupils as if she had caught on to something.

“The dress of Ni Chang is the belonging of an immortal, and it’s unrealistically beautiful. But what’s fake, and what’s real? You have to let me know that the Profound Fairy is real so I can weave the beauty of the dress. I need something real to correspond with the unreal of the dress.” Lin Yun explained.

Mu Xueling’s face changed when she heard that, and she muttered to herself, “No wonder no one could succeed. The fake needs something real to correspond with. If everything is fake, the fake will become the real, and the dress will lose its ancient rhythm and unrealistic beauty.”
