Chapter 1422 - Got It!

“Looks like you’re getting more used to hitting women.” Lil’ Purple mocked as she rolled her eyes in the sword box.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he heard that before he bitterly smiled. It was hard to explain, and Lil’ Purple was probably talking about An Liuyan’s incident back at the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion. That was really a misunderstanding because An Liuyan was using her charming tricks to take on Su Ziyao’s appearance.

If he didn’t give An Liuyan a warning, the latter would definitely take it even further. At that time, he might really fall for her charm tricks, and there was no way Lin Yun would be willing to put himself in a dangerous situation.

As for what he just did, Lin Yun was exhausted from seeing people acting before him, and he even felt tired of Ye Ziyun when she put on an act earlier. The two might have been traveling together before, but they both had their guards up against each other, which was why they limited their speed and didn’t catch up to the Indigo Dragon Serpent.

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t turn down her request since she asked for it, not to mention that he also wanted to get rid of her. Besides, he didn’t use his full strength behind that palm, or Ye Ziyun would still be lying on the ground by now.

However, he did not need to explain that to Lil’ Purple. All of his attention was now devoted to killing the Indigo Dragon Serpent. The Indigo Dragon Serpent was injured, and it was relying on the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead to recover from most of its injuries, and this meant that Lin Yun would have some difficulty when trying to kill it.

It was a monarch demonic beast, which meant it had a powerful vitality. Regardless of the beast core in its head, it was protected by dragon scales, and it was hard for Lin Yun to break through the scales with his firmament sword intent. As for its other spots, the Indigo Dragon Serpent was four to five hundred meters in size. So Lin Yun would have to spend some time killing it even if it didn’t move.

Seeing Lin Yun ignoring her, Lil’ Purple threw a tantrum, “You woke this empress up, and you’re not talking to me. Hmph, what a scumbag!”

“Cut it out. I’ve never hit you.” Lin Yun replied as he avoided the Indigo Dragon Serpent’s breath.

“Scumbags are really forgetful. You hit this empress multiple times and even hit me on my butt!” Lil’ Purple snapped. “You bastard! How dare you treat it as if it didn’t happen! I hate you!”

Lin Yun nearly choked on his saliva, and had an astonished expression. That did happen, and Lin Yun didn’t know how to explain himself. Thus, he could only bite the bullet, “Bullshit. That’s the love of when a father hits his daughter.”

“You bastard! Not only are you a scumbag, but you’re also a lecher!” Lil’ Purple snarled with her face reddened.

Lin Yun also felt a little strange when he said those words. But the thought did cross his mind that it would be nice to have a daughter like Lil’ Purple, if she didn’t like to brag so much. But he soon shook those thoughts out of his head. It wasn’t a good sign to become someone’s father on a whim.

“Empress, is there any way to kill this little snake? I’m afraid Lil’ Red won’t be able to last for much longer.” Lin Yun asked.

Lil’ Red had to face six enemies, and Lin Yun feared it would suffer, especially since Xiahou Yan had the Innate Sword Physique, Innate Sword Heart, and firmament sword intent. Not to mention that he was also ranked in the top three thousandths on the Elysium Core Ranking.

“Summon your constellation, duh. You should be able to summon four paintings now…” Lil’ Purple calmed herself for the time being, since this involved Lil’ Red’s safety.

“Anything else?” If he could, Lin Yun would’ve summoned his constellation long ago. He chose not to because he had his reservations.

Lil’ Purple suddenly became reliable. “Besides that, if you want to kill it quickly, you can use the Myriad Lightning Divine Rune. You still remember the seal I taught you, right?”

Lin Yun had his concerns about using a Sovereign Divine Rune. But he soon tossed them aside because the Sovereign Divine Rune wasn’t at its strongest state so no one should notice it.

As various thoughts crossed his mind, a slimy venomous fog began seep out from the Indigo Dragon Serpent it struggled under his foot. The fog swiftly spread out. Even though Lin Yun shut his pores in time, the venom still infiltrated his body.

Lin Yun opened his hand and saw a black mark on his palm. It was swiftly spreading over his arm. He tried to restrain the spread using the dragon runes, but the poison was corroding the dragon runes upon getting closer to them. The entire process was slow but visible to the naked eye.

“I can’t get rid of the poison even with the firmament sword intent. That makes sense since this Indigo Dragon Serpent has been growing in this Secret Realm. So it doesn’t fear sword intent.” Lin Yun analyzed the poison and quickly figured out the reason.

“Young lad!” The Indigo Dragon Serpent’s hoarse voice resounded right at this moment. It sounded tired and was even gasping for breath. It no longer had the arrogance from before.

Lin Yun might seem tiny when he stood on it, but his sword aura was like an endless mountain range, weighing it down. So no matter how the Indigo Dragon Serpent struggled, it couldn’t get rid of Lin Yun and was displaying an even more pathetic state.

When the Indigo Dragon Serpent spoke, it was much more respectful, "It hasn’t been easy for me to come this far in my cultivation. Spare my life, and I’ll spare yours. Otherwise, there’s nothing in it for you if I drag you down with me!”

“Let you go? I bet you don’t intend to let me off at all.” Lin Yun lowered his hand as he stood on the Indigo Dragon Serpent. “I bet this venom takes a lot out of you, but it’s a pity that you can’t poison me to death within three to five days. So you can’t drag me down, and you can also stop trying to buy time.”

“You bastard!” The Indigo Dragon Serpent went silent for a moment before it flew into a rage. It suddenly turned its head around and lunged at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun already expected that the Indigo Dragon Serpent would try and attack him, but he didn’t choose to avoid it. The golden human in his sword ocean began to radiate light. Lin Yun looked devilish as the purple mark on his forehead began to heat up. Simultaneously, he began to accumulate power in the center of his forehead.

“Divine Azure Annihilation!” Lin Yun roared when the Indigo Dragon Serpent was about to bite him. When a golden azure dragon flew from his forehead, the azure dragon sword soul dispersed, and everything in the surroundings was instantly restricted.

The Indigo Dragon Serpent was petrified, unable to move. But that wasn’t all, the Divine Azure Annihilation even restricted its breathing, blood flow, and cell movements. This was the strongest attack of Lin Yun’s firmament sword intent from his two sword souls.

After Lin Yun unleashed the Divine Azure Annihilation, he began to form seals. Lightning started to rumble from the secret realm inside his sword box. As the Myriad Lightning Divine Rune slowly rose, it unleashed waves of destructive power, using the most primitive destructive aura. The Myriad Lightning Divine Rune was born in primal chaos and was the king of all lightning.

It soon filled the Iris Secret Realm with a domineering, destructive, noble, primitive, and ancient aura. When Lil’ Purple stood beside the Phoenix Tree, the lightning shone on her flawless face, giving her an ethereal temperament. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“This empress is the Divine Phoenix Race’s…” Lil’ Purple murmured her title to herself as she reminisced about the past. It was a time when demons could be found everywhere, and she was still a supreme existence.

Those memories were simultaneously familiar and unfamiliar, making her feel a sense of vicissitudes. If Lin Yun was in the Iris Secret Realm right now, he would notice that Lil’ Purple had grown a little after sleeping for so long. But evidently, he didn’t have the time.

Manipulating the Myriad Lightning Divine Rune took everything out of him, turning his face pale. Even the astral energy that filled his violet palace was swiftly being sapped away from him. It didn’t take long for a corner of the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron to emerge from the ocean of astral energy.

“That’s enough.” Lin Yun’s eyelid twitched as he gave up manipulating any more of the Sovereign Divine Rune’s power and slammed his palm against the Indigo Dragon Serpent. When he slammed his palm down, the restriction created by the Divine Azure Annihilation disappeared. This meant that the Indigo Dragon Serpent could move once more. It continued to roar and bite at Lin Yun, with no idea of what had just happened.

But it couldn’t take a bite at Lin Yun. Waves of lightning were pouring into its body through Lin Yun’s palm. Everything happened in the blink of an eye, and the Indigo Dragon Serpent began to shrivel like a deflating balloon.

The Indigo Dragon Serpent completely melted away in that split second. Everything from its internal organs, bones, flesh, and blood liquidated. This scene shocked everyone outside the Barren Sword Mound, wondering if their eyes were messing with them.

After Lin Yun unleashed his attack, the dried-up ocean of astral energy began to surge with waves. It was a comfortable feeling because he had quickly released the million Divine Astral Pellets he had refined. After nearly draining all of his astral energy and recovering it in a short period, cracks began to appear in his bottleneck to the Greater Elysium Core Realm.

He was now one step closer to the Greater Elysium Core Realm, and this was a pleasant surprise.

“Oh my god!” Lin Yun was shocked by what he saw when he opened his eyes. It was too extravagant because he didn’t even use one-thousandth of the Myriad Lightning Divine Rune’s power. But shortly after, he became nervous and wondered if the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead had melted, since the Indigo Dragon Serpent was only left with its skin.

“Found it!” Lin Yun found a fist-sized bead in the pool of blood with ten rings. This brought a smile to his pale face as he retrieved the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead, not caring how dirty it was. When he held onto the tenth-gade Spiritual Sword Bead, he couldn’t help laughing.
