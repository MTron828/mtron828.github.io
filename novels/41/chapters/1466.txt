Chapter 1467 - Ninth-Grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower's Appearance

Wang Cheng’s sword was fast and strange. No one expected him to emerge from the sun. It looked like he walked out of the sun, basking in the dazzling crimson sword rays. In a matter of seconds, the tip of his sword reached Lin Yun’s chest, and this caused an uproar in the surroundings because Wang Cheng was too ruthless.

Even if Wang Cheng went easy on Lin Yun in this attack, he was still too ruthless. If Lin Yun were stabbed in his heart, he would be heavily injured for half a year, even if he wasn’t dead. But this was how the battle between experts unfolded, and every moment could be dangerous.

But no one said anything about Wang Cheng because this was how swordsmen fought. But when Wang Cheng’s sword reached Lin Yun’s chest, something that no one could have expected occurred. When his sword came in contact with Lin Yun’s chest, the Blood Flame Divine Rune in his heart blazed and blocked Wang Cheng’s sword.

As a terrifying power spread, water geysers exploded on the lake. This made Wang Cheng furrow his brows with shock. But he wasn’t the only one, Luo Chendong and Zhang Yue were also shocked. Although they knew Lin Yun had a powerful physique, they didn’t expect Wang Cheng to fail to break through his defenses.

“Are you a monster…?” The corner of Wang Cheng’s lip twitched.

“You're unaware of many things in the world.” Lin Yun said with a cold light flashing through his pupils. Even if his Innate Azure Dragon Saint Art was flawed without a dragon bone, that depended on who he was being compared with. Even if it was flawed, it would seem too pathetic if he couldn’t block a sword. However, the dragon runes might not be able to take another sword. Then again, Wang Cheng no longer had the chance to use another sword.

When Lin Yun was done, his dragon runes began to blaze and the dragon runes began to wriggle on the surface of his body. His heart was pumping with boundless vitality every moment, and the terrifying power from his physique made Wang Cheng’s sword bend under the strain.

Wang Cheng was ultimately sent flying away, but he was ranked third on the Earth Ranking. Although he wasn’t comparable to the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking, this didn’t mean he was weak. He was strong and easily negated the rebound force by stomping his foot on the lake.

His stomp made the lake cave in before forming a huge vortex. Wang Cheng used this force to charge forth with even more terrifying momentum.

“I already said that this is the end for you!” Wang Cheng wore a grave expression with a ruthless light flashing through his pupils. It was a great humiliation for him that he was forced to this point by Lin Yun. After all, he was ranked third on the Earth Ranking. He wasn’t Huangfu Yan, who was barely hanging on in the Earth Ranking, and he had his pride as a disciple of the Scarlet Firmament Peak.

He didn’t want to embarrass his senior brother. So Lin Yun had to be stopped here, no matter what. As he soared to the sky, the sword rays that were being emitted from him shone even more brightly, and he had fully unleashed the profundity of the Scarlet Firmament Sword Sutra.

“Kill!” Luo Chendong and Zhang Yue were briefly stunned before they also dashed forth with decisive lights flashing through their pupils. Lin Yun was stronger than they had imagined, but he was alone, and there were four of them ganging up on him. If they still couldn’t stop him, this would make the Earth Ranking look like a joke in the future.

Lin Yun raised his brow with surprise flashing through his pupils. It wasn’t because of those three. He could sense fluctuations of sword intent coming from the bottom of the lake. The sword intent was weak, but the aura was terrifying.

Is this a sign that the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower is going to appear soon? Lin Yun pondered. He was practically certain of it because there shouldn’t be any treasure in the Celestial Observing Lake that could emit such a terrifying sword intent.

“Distracted in our fight? Lin Yun, how dare you disregard us!” Wang Cheng pushed his Scarlet Firmament Sword Sutra to the limit and executed a ghost spirit martial technique. But he flew into a rage when he noticed Lin Yun was distracted.

Lin Yun quickly came to his senses. He glanced at Luo Chengdong and Zhang Yue, who were coming at him from both sides. He wasn’t only facing one ghost spirit sword technique, but three that were executed with the sword sutras from their respective peaks. They wanted to replicate what they previously did to suppress Lin Yun, inflicting severe injuries before he could catch his breath. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this instance, Lin Yun knew that he couldn’t drag the battle out any longer because the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower was about to appear. His current circumstance was a little troublesome because he would have to reveal his trump cards if he wanted to end the battle swiftly. But he would have to face Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi after entering the core region.

In the end, Lin Yun could only take a table. As he unleashed his dual sword souls, a light flashed through his pupils and imprinted the three’s sword techniques into his mind. Before everyone could figure out what was going on, Lin Yun clasped his hands together and closed his eyes.

“What is he trying to do?”

“Did he give up?”

“Isn’t he afraid of death?”

All the Elysium Core Realm disciples on the Celestial Observing Lake nearly went insane because Lin Yun would always make unexpected moves, and their adrenaline would rush. Lin Yun actually closed his eyes when facing three ghost spirit sword techniques. Just what was he trying to do?

“Don’t tell me he’s planning to resolve their sword techniques after they get close? Isn’t this a little too ridiculous?” Someone whispered. This person concluded that even he wouldn’t believe in it. But it didn’t matter as everyone’s eyes were focused on Lin Yun.

Just when the three sword techniques were about to envelop him, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes. As the Nether Sword Seed bloomed in his violet palace, Lin Yun took a step out, and the Twelve-Petaled Netherflower caused the sky to rumble.

Lin Yun divided into three before everyone, and the three Lin Yuns pushed out a palm, destroying the three ghost spirit sword techniques. This made his three opponents throw out mouthfuls of blood before they fell from the sky.

When they looked at Lin Yun again, the three afterimages overlapped and Lin Yun collapsed his hands together as if nothing had happened.

Meanwhile, Wang Cheng, Luo Chengdong, and Zhang Yue threw out more mouthfuls of blood with disbelief in their pupils. Lin Yun found the fatal flaw in their sword techniques when he made his move earlier, causing their ghost spirit sword techniques to crumble and made the three of them suffer the backlash.

Wang Cheng’s internal organs were blazing because of the backlash. Luo Chengdong and Zhang Yue were also in a similar situation as him. The three looked at Lin Yun with shock, as though they were looking at a monster.

“You… how did you manage to do it…” Wang Cheng asked while gritting his teeth.

“That’s a secret!” Lin Yun smiled and waved his hand before he passed the three of them.

As for Huangfu Yan, he was in the lake and had no idea what was happening. But when his head popped out from the lake, Lin Yun stepped on his head, using the momentum to increase his speed and entered the fog.

This made Huangfu Yan throw out a mouthful of blood, and this scene made the lips of Huangfu Jue, the peak master of the Azure Firmament Peak, twitch. His son had been an utter embarrassment today. Not only was he defeated after one exchange, Lin Yun had even used his head as a stepping stone, nearly driving him insane.

“That brat is too much. We’re all from the same sect, and yet he’s ruthless with his feet. Senior Brother Huangfu, don’t worry. I will surely reprimand him back at the Divine Firmament Peak!” Mu Chuan couldn’t help laughing as he poured oil into the fire.

“Hehe.” Mu Chuan awkwardly smiled, then shut his mouth when Huangfu Jue glared at him. He knew that if he continued, Huangfu Jue, who had just declared that he would drink all the lake water in the Celestial Observing Lake, would lose it on the spot. But Mu Chuan had to admit that his junior brother had done a good job and might even be able to become the champion. He rolled his eyes and inwardly smiled because he noticed that Lin Yun’s performance had even affected him.

While everyone was still immersed in the fact that Lin Yun used Huangfu Yan’s head as a stepping stone, a sword ray suddenly exploded from the mist as two terrifying sword auras clashed within the fog, instantly attracting everyone’s attention. Anyone who wanted to enter the core region would have to face Yu Qingfeng’s sword ray.

Just when everyone felt uncertain, a sword ray exploded and dispersed the surrounding fog. As the fog dissipated, everyone saw Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi facing off in the sky. Simultaneously, Lin Yun grabbed a sword ray with two hands, his hair fluttering wildly in the wind.

That didn’t seem like a sword ray at all but a dragon. But no matter how violent it was, it couldn’t break free from Lin Yun’s control. A brief moment later, that sword ray began to shatter inch by inch as if it had never appeared before.

This scene made all the disciples who failed to enter the core region dumbfounded. Even if that sword ray wasn’t the same attack Yu Qingfeng used to slice the two peaks three thousand years ago; they were still connected. But the sword ray that frightened them was actually so easily resolved by Lin Yun?

Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan also turned their heads over and were shocked when they saw this scene. But before the two could be shocked for long, the lake's surface exploded with waves of golden aura spreading out. This was a sign that the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower would appear soon.

This made Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan immediately come to their senses and disappear, hurriedly dashing towards the center of the lake.

“It’s finally becoming interesting…” Lin Yun smiled as he also charged forth.
