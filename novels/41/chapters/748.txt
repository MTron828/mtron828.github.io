Chapter 749 - Supreme Dominance!

Ji Wuye was completely dumbfounded by this scene. He might not be comparable to his senior brother, Wu Xiaotian, but he was certainly just as impressive.

He was only in the greater Yin-Yang stage and there was no one who had the same accomplishment of killing four quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts. Even Murong Qing, who had a higher cultivation, only managed to kill three quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts.

His cultivation technique refined his killing aura and fused it with his sword technique. This was why his sword technique was born for slaughter. The more he killed, the more refined his killing aura would be. Plus, he could also devour the surrounding demonic aura.

This was a rather terrifying method that even left the surrounding demonic cultivators dumbfounded. But Ji Wuye still paled in comparison to Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun could fight nine quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts at the same time while remaining composed. Compared to Lin Yun, his accomplishments were nothing, so his cheeks burned with shame.

“Damn it. How did this fellow manage to do it?” Ji Wuye clenched his right fist with reluctance in his eyes. Half a year ago, Lin Yun stole the spotlight in the Withernorth Sea. When he left, he made a name for himself by killing three elders of the Bloodwing Pavilion. Lin Yun’s actions even forced a Heavenly Soul Realm expert to personally make a move. The expert even shattered Lin Yun’s sword aura, but he was unable to capture Lin Yun.

Ji Wuye spent the next six months bitterly cultivating and cleansing his body with killing aura. He originally wanted to cleanse himself of his humiliation before the Draconic Banquet. However, he never expected that after six months had passed, he would only be able to look at Lin Yun’s back.

Not many people could understand the suffering he had to go through. Along with Ji Wuye, other people also began to take note of Lin Yun. While Ji Wuye was distracted, another quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast was dragged into the sword aura.

“Big Bang!” Lin Yun was fully submerged in the battle and had forgotten about everything around him. His sword technique was currently displaying its domineering nature. When he swung his sword out, his sword intent manifested into a lightning sphere that descended like a star. But suddenly, it displayed a different type of grace in his hand.

“Decipher, decipher, and decipher!” Lin Yun used a peculiar method to fuse the overbearing sword technique into his sword aura. As his sword intent roared, weak lightning flashed in the air. The rumbling lightning wasn’t loud, but it was everywhere. Just like that, all ten demonic beasts were enveloped in the sword aura before they were all knocked away.

Faster, I have to be even faster! Lin Yun’s movement moved even faster as he pushed his speed to the limit. But his domineering sword technique was soft, which gave others a different feeling. His origin energy fluctuated as his sword aura left more injuries on the demonic beasts trapped in his sword aura.

“Weird, this person’s sword intent is really weird. His sword is terrifying fast, but it doesn’t cause any fluctuation when he stabs his sword out.”

“That’s right! That’s the feeling! It feels like a mountain is being tossed into a lake, but it isn’t causing any ripples.”

“Interesting...he’s comprehending his sword technique. His sword aura is like a lake and he’s refined it to an unprecedented height. This is why those demonic beasts aren’t able to break free. But even so, it’s still giving off that feeling of a mountain dropping into a lake. His aura has already trapped ten demonic beasts, so why hasn’t it exploded? Just how can he manage to bear that with his physique?”

Swordmire City was a city named after swords, so there were many swordsmen present. After their initial shock, they naturally noticed something unusual about Lin Yun’s sword technique and the doubt in their eyes continued to grow.

“The fact that he can control his sword technique so well is amazing. It’s incredible that he can achieve this.”

“It’s not just control. His sword is also terrifyingly fast even though it seems slow. His attack can go from one sword to ten swords and then one hundred swords in the same time it takes to swing one sword. This person is really a genius in the path of the sword. Where did he come from?”

“He’s still comprehending his technique. Isn’t he afraid of blowing up?” Everyone looked at Lin Yun who was fully immersed in his thoughts. But those who were knowledgeable in the path of swords all felt a chill down their spine as they couldn’t imagine how powerful Lin Yun’s attack would be when it finally exploded.

“I have to be fast enough. The Overlord Sword might seem gentle enough, but it has become even more powerful.” Lin Yun rejoiced inwardly as he was immersed in his comprehension. This beast tide was indeed an opportunity for him. Not only was it beneficial for his sword technique, but he could also sense that his sword technique was improving.

The feeling was bizarre and it couldn’t be described with mere words. At the same time, Long Hao, who was protecting Murong Qing, also noticed Lin Yun. He was shocked as he instantly recognized the sword technique that Lin Yun was using, “Is this the attack he used to face the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape back then?”

Unlike other people who could only tell that this sword technique was domineering, Long Hao had personally witnessed the might of the sword technique. This technique had completely left Long Hao dumbfounded and the shock in his heart couldn’t be described.

As Lin Yun continued his process, all ten quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts were covered in wounds. When Long Hao saw this, he wondered if Lin Yun was a madman for tempering his sword with his body. As Long Hao took a cold breath, he realized how shocked his heart was.

Suddenly, Lin Yun soared into the sky like a golden sun that radiated through the demonic clouds. At this moment, Lin Yun couldn’t hold back the Overlord Sword anymore. It was time to unleash his attack.

Pushing the Overlord Sword to the limit, Lin Yun finally let go. A golden light flashed and all ten quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts were killed without putting up any resistance. In the end, the golden radiance covered the ground in a layer of gold.

But those who saw this scene narrowed their eyes as their hearts almost jumped out of their chests. Up to this point, they were imagining how powerful Lin Yun’s attack would be after the exploded. However, they never expected that it would powerful enough to kill all ten demonic beasts with just one sword.

Although the ten quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts were covered in wounds, the shock of Lin Yun’s attack wasn’t inferior in any way to Wu Xiaotian’s strongest attack.

Ji Wuye’s heart turned cold after paying attention to Lin Yun. He was surpassed by Lin Yun in that split second and now Lin Yun had twice the amount of kills that he had.

“Lord Long, is this person also a genius in the Sword Alliance?” Murong Qing asked with flickering eyes. The impact caused by that attack was so great that it also caught his attention. He felt ripples through his heart when he saw ten demonic beasts being killed in an instant. This was why he asked Long Hao if Lin Yun was a genius in the Sword Alliance.

“No. That person’s name is Lin Yun. I invited him, but he rejected me.” Long Hao said with a regretful tone as he licked his lips.

Lin Yun? Murong Qing’s face sank with killing aura surging in his pupils when he heard that name. He suddenly remembered that it was this person who ruined the Imperial Sword Herb prepared for him by the Scarletblood Sword Dojo.

This person dared to come knowing that I am here? Did he completely disregard my existence? Murong Qing’s face sank as he said coldly, “Since he rejected the Sword Alliance, then he can go and die!”

“Don’t!” Long Hao quickly pleaded, but he had no idea of Murong Qing’s hatred for Lin Yun. After all, Murong Qing was upset about the Imperial Sword Herb, which was a treasure that could bring his sword intent to complete mastery.

He pushed his movement technique to the limit and charged towards Lin Yun. His sword technique was powerful and tore through all the demonic beasts in his path.

“Not bad. I’ll call this move Supreme Dominance.” Lin Yun landed on the ground and gasped for air. This was a completely new attack that fused four of the Overlord Sword’s forms. In the future, he would be able to fuse all nine forms together for an even stronger attack. Right at this moment, he suddenly felt a chilling sword aura directed at him.

“Oh shit!”

“Murong Qing wants to kill him!” Everyone was shocked as they never expected that Murong Qing would try to kill Lin Yun. Furthermore, the opportunity he chose was simply too perfect. But they couldn’t figure out why he hated Lin Yun to the point where he wanted to kill him.

Everyone thought that Lin Yun would be heavily injured, but he turned around and stabbed his sword out. The style of this sword was different from the Overlord Sword as he had merged the entire Dustlight Sword Art together and caused multiple phenomena to appear.

“Lin Yun, stay your sword!” Long Hao was terrified to death when he saw this scene.

The Flower Burial Sword pierced through Murong Qing’s aura and stabbed his chest. As Lin Yun’s sword ray exploded, Murong Qing threw up a mouthful of blood and was sent flying away. He flew at least a few times faster than before.

When he flew backwards, the sword ray continued to explode on his body. By the time he landed on the ground, Murong Qing was covered with injuries as he rolled on the ground in pain.

“Thanks.” Long Hao thanked Lin Yun upon seeing that Murong Qing was still alive.

But Lin Yun merely took a glance at him, which sent chills down Long Hao’s spine. But right at this moment, a demonic aura soared into the sky and several quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm experts were left half-dead.

Simultaneously, an overlord quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast broke through the restriction and reached the second battlefield. Everyone’s face changed in panic.

If the demonic beast really got to the city, the slaughtering would be inevitable. When Long Hao raised his head, his heart sank instantly as he recognized this demonic beast. It was the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape.
