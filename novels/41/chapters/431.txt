Chapter 432 - Fiery Temper

Lin Yun emitted a shocking aura when the four seals overlapped. Like a volcano eruption, he emitted a dazzling brilliance.

How is that possible?! Tong Yuan was completely shocked. He couldn’t understand how someone who wasn’t a Buddhist disciple could comprehend the fourth seal.

“No…” Tong Yuan’s face changed. He wanted to hold back his attack, but it was too late. The power of four combined seals wasn’t something Lin Yun could control.

The two figures clashed in the sky and created a resounding rumble, which struck everyone’s heart. Ten breaths later, the weaker cultivators fainted because of the pressure.

Tong Yuan was nothing in front of the four combined seals, so he was instantly and heavily injured. At the same time, a crack echoed in the atmosphere that sounded like some had shattered. When the shattered phenomena swirled together, it formed a violet turbulent energy on the stage.

Just when everyone was shocked by the clash, a cold snort sounded out from the stage. Within the turbulence of energy, a blurred figure waved his sleeve that swept away the dust from the stage. When the figure was revealed, it was Lin Yun who stood on the stage with dominance.

“The Heavenly Seal!”

“Holy shit. An outsider was actually able to form the Heavenly Seal. That’s a seal that not every elder can form.”

“How frightening. Not only was Lin Yun able to form the Heavenly Seal, but he was also able to achieve the four combined seals.”

“With Tong Yuan defeated, who can stop him on the eighth stage?” The spectators were all shocked. They all felt that Lin Yun was going to die, but Lin Yun had suddenly turned the tables around and crushed Tong Yuan with the Heavenly Seal.

The faces of the elders and disciples of the Heavenly Profound Sect were unsightly. They knew how hard it was to comprehend the Heavenly Seal and only two disciples managed to grasp it. One was Drifting Goblet and the other was Trueorigin. The former spent two years grasping it, while the latter spent three years and only to barely grasp it. But how long had Lin Yun been practicing the Dragon-Tiger Sword? One year at most!

“Damn it! How did that brat manage to do it!” The elder who led the Heavenly Profound Sect’s party trembled. It was humiliating that a Heavenly Profound Sect’s disciple was defeated by the Dragon-Tiger Fist.

“Is that all the Heavenly Profound Sect has? If this sword slave dared to use the Dracophant Battle Physique before my Primal Origin Sect, death would be his only outcome,” sneered Wen Yanbo. He might have an enmity with the Sword Firmament Pavilion, but he was also unhappy with the Heavenly Profound Sect, who claimed to be the strongest sect in the empire. So he was naturally happy to see the Heavenly Profound Sect get humiliated.

“He’s stronger than I imagined, but he’s only courting death if he dares to compete with me in the Dracophant Battle Physique,” commented Heartcliff. His gaze was grave when he looked at Lin Yun, but his pride didn’t allow him to consider Lin Yun his opponent.

Lin Yun stood proudly on the stage, emitting an indescribable dominance that briefly stunned the judge. He never imagined that Tong Yuan would be defeated by the Dragon-Tiger Fist. After all, Tong Yuan grasped the Vajra Battle Physique. However, he was even more shocked that Lin Yun actually managed to use the Heavenly Seal, manifesting the heavens with his sword.

No one in the Great Qin Empire’s history managed to accomplish such a feat. Using the Heavenly Seal with Buddhism and sword were two completely different concepts. The latter was ten times harder than the former.

On the eighth stage, Tong Yuan was lying on the ground. His skin had also returned to normal since his battle physique was destroyed by Lin Yun. Then again, he would be dead if it wasn’t for his battle physique.

“You said that I’m courting death to fight you with the Dragon-Tiger Fist? I don’t think so,” said Lin Yun as he looked at Tong Yuan.

“I have nothing to say since I lost. But do you have to humiliate me? So what if you won? You still won’t be able to escape death. If you run into Flying Feather, Twilight, Heartcliff, or my sect’s Trueorigin, which one of them will let you live?” Tong Yuan gnashed his teeth with reluctance in his eyes.

On the stage, Lin Yun instantly felt four cold gazes on him. The four gazes naturally came from the four titled figures that Tong Yuan mentioned. The four titled figures merely used their gazes to tear apart Lin Yun’s sword aura as though they wanted to imprint him deeply in their minds.

“Haha, don’t get conceited. You’re just a clown. Do you think that you can really soar into the sky?” Tong Yuan was pleased to see the four titled figures looking at Lin Yun. Now that he had lost, he could only try and get a win with his words. “What’s the matter? My words hit a nerve, didn’t they? You’re still a dead man even if you beat me. Even if I lost, I can always come back three years later to get a title. In the end, I will still be the last one laughing…”

But before he could finish, a boundless origin energy pulled him over. Before he knew it, Lin Yun was already grabbing him by his neck.

“Who gave you the courage to speak before me? You’re just a loser. Three years later? What can the Heavenly Profound Sect do to me if I kill you here?” Mockery appeared on Lin Yun’s face.

Tong Yuan struggled with fear in his eyes. He wanted to surrender, but he couldn’t utter a word since his neck was grabbed by Lin Yun.

“Get lost.” In the end, Lin Yun spared Tong Yuan’s life on behalf of Drifting Goblet and threw the latter out of the stage.

Tong Yuan fell onto the ground as he gasped for his breath. When he raised his head and saw Lin Yun looking at him, he stumbled and ran away. He no longer had the courage to utter another word.

“Lin Yun wins!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lin Yun appeared back in the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s ranks. This battle had given everyone a whole new understanding of him. He was someone who dared to draw his sword at the crown prince’s wedding. So if anyone thought that he had a good temper, then Tong Yuan would be a good example for them.

“When did you grasp the Heavenly Seal?” Xin Yan looked at Lin Yun with splendour in her eyes.

“A few days ago,” said Lin Yun. He didn’t hide anything from Xin Yan.

“I never knew you had such a fiery temper. I like it!” chuckled Xin Yan. Tong Yuan was acting like a fool to say those words when he lost, which made Xin Yan so furious that she even wanted to go on the stage to beat him up.

“Lin Yun, you’ll be able to make it into the second round with another win. Although Tong Yuan’s words didn’t sound nice, they still made sense. Surrender immediately if you sense that something isn’t right, understood?” Luo Feng said as he looked at Lin Yun with a grave expression.

“I understand.” Lin Yun nodded his head.

As the Dragon Gate Competition progressed, the situation became clearer. It was already sunset when everyone noticed the time. At that point, the Dragon Gate Plaza was dyed with a crimson color.

The participants who made it to the second round emerged and all the popular candidates had successfully made it in. However, there was one person that no one had expected, the Hundred Beast Gate’s Feng Ye. The Hundred Beast Gate was located at the border of the empire. His performance was nothing surprising in the previous competition, but no one had expected that he would be so strong in this competition.

He was simply like a humanoid beast with his physical strength. It made sense since he was someone from the Barbarian Tribe. Because of the spiritual fruit that he ate in the Black Lotus Hall, his bloodline underwent an evolution.

He had now become a popular candidate to become the eighth title. Looking at him, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he never expected Ye Feng to have such swift growth.

“Eighth group, Lin Yun VS Wu Mohan!” The judge announced Lin Yun’s last battle while he was in deep thought.
