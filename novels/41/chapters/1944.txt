Chapter 1945 - Bai Shuying (1)

The Solar Jade Palace. This is the residence of the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint that’s within the Nether Orchid Courtyard. The palace was enveloped in a saint radiance, and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was seated on a hovering stone platform.

The area beneath the stone platform was surrounded by a river, and an ancient painting that was hung on the wall behind the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, made her seem dignified.

Bai Shuying’s face changed after hearing what her master said, and she didn’t know how to reply to that question.

Half a month ago, she swore before Ye Qingtian that she would never step into Indigo Thunder Peak for the rest of her lifetime, and she wouldn’t even get close to Indigo Thunder Peak within a ten-mile radius. But her master asked her to invite Ye Qingtian over, which was unacceptable. After all, it was no different from slapping her face.

“I don’t have that intention,” Bai Shuying said with her head lowered. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had always been strict, and her words were already serious.

But she had no idea that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was baffled. She knew her disciple’s personality. Her disciple was prideful, but she rarely revealed it and wouldn’t look down on ordinary inner disciples because of her identity as a holy maiden. Bai Shuying didn’t treat her identity as the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden seriously.

“Are you concerned about what he said? I did hear some things about him, and he hasn’t changed even after returning. I heard that he’s still harassing you,” the Heavenly Jade Holy Maiden said.

“I don’t like him,” Bai Shuying said honestly.

“I know you don’t like him, but it’s enough that he likes you. So he’ll come if you invite him, and you don’t have to be polite. You just have to invite him over, and the Dragon Origin Great Saint won’t say anything about it,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

This placed Bai Shuying in a difficult position. This was nothing like it was in the past, and she could easily accomplish it. But she had her difficulties, and she could imagine the smugness on Ye Qingtian’s face when she went over. She ultimately agreed, “I’ll handle it well.”

She agreed to it for now and planned to let someone else do it.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint saw through her intentions and said, “You have to do it yourself. Seven days from now, I will call every potential swordsman here to guide them personally, and Ye Qingtian has to be present, no matter what. The reason why I gave this task to you is because he’s fond of you. This way, the Dragon Origin Great Saint won’t be able to say anything about it, so I’ll be able to deal with him.”

Bai Shuying was inwardly surprised. She’s curious as to what Ye Qingtian did to make her master and the Dragon Origin Great Saint place such a high opinion of him. Ye Qingtian was only at the Profound Death Stage. Even if he was the champion of the Di Group, there was no way he could be compared to those geniuses in the Tian Group.

Even if Ye Qingtian went to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, there was no way he could catch up to those geniuses at the late phase of the Nirvana Stage.

“Master, is there a need to be concerned about the Dragon Origin Great Saint?” Bai Shuying asked. She might be talking about the Dragon Origin Great Saint, but she wanted to diminish Ye Qingtian’s existence within the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

“It’s different now,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint sighed. “He has become the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s secluded disciple.”

Since Ye Qingtian had become the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s secluded disciple, it would be a different story if someone else tried to recruit him. In serious cases, it might become an incident of disregarding the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

“The secluded disciple!” Bai Shuying was shocked. Even she was not the secluded disciple of the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and yet Ye Qingtian was a step ahead of her, which was too unbelievable. It had just been a few months since the last Sword Discussion Gathering.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint reminded, “We’ll settle with that. There’s no need to lower yourself or go against your heart; you just have to invite him over. If the Dragon Origin Great Saint says anything, I’ll say it’s your intention.”

Bai Shuying gritted her teeth and ultimately nodded. There was nothing she could do about it, and she didn’t have a choice since the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said it three times.

When Bai Shuying left, her brows were still furrowed together.

Within Indigo Thunder Peak, Lin Yun spent half of the month within the Iris Secret Realm, focusing on nurturing the Phoenix Tree with Lil’ Purple.

In his free time, he would practice the Divine Firefly Sword and stabilize his cultivation at the seventh channel of the Profound Death Stage. Occasionally, he would learn the Heavenly Silkworm Hands from Lil’ Purple and spent his time pretty relaxed.

He needed to relax after spending such a long time within the Three-Lives Realm to digest his harvest.

“Lin Yun, look! The Phoenix Tree has grown!” Lil’ Purple said.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, the death energy within his pupils dissipated as Netherflowers appeared and disappeared around him. He had reached the tenth stage of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, and the death energy he grasped had reached a terrifying height.

As Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Lil’ Purple excitedly looking at the Phoenix Tree, and it had grown to the same height as her.

The Phoenix Tree had grown by a palm’s height in just half a month, brimming with spiritual energy. According to what Lil’ Purple said, the Iris Secret Realm used to be a holy land in the past, and it was a movable holy land that could be carried on someone’s back in the form of a sword box.

Then again, it was still far away to be considered a holy land. The entire Iris Secret Realm was desolate, aside from the region around the Phoenix Tree.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“You’ve finished using up all the True Dragon Saint Liquid?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“Yeah.”

“So quickly?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

Lil’ Purple smiled, “It’s still alright. The best nutrients from the Phoenix Tree are the ashes of a Phoenix after undergoing a rebirth. The True Dragon Saint Liquid also works and will continue to grow. After it grows to seven feet, the Phoenix Tree will finally come to life.”

“I heard that the Phoenix Tree is a treasure, and a tree branch can be sold for an astronomical sum. Even a leaf can be used to boost cultivation, and it can also be used as tea leaves,” Lin Yun asked with his eyes lighting up.

But Lil’ Purple immediately stood before the Phoenix Tree sapling and asked, “What are you trying to do? It’s still a child, so you’re not allowed to damage it.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling when he saw this scene because Lil’ Purple was also a child.
