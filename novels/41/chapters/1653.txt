Chapter 1654 – He’s Here! (2)

The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder was still resisting the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella that flew over. So when his constellation shattered, he threw out a mouthful of blood. Taking this opportunity, the umbrella knocked away the blade and reached the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder.

When he was sent flying back, the face of the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder became distorted and ugly. Lin Yun spread his arms apart and slowly suppressed the turmoil within his body. He then tapped his foot on the ground and turned into a streak of light.

In a breath’s time, Lin Yun grabbed onto the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella once more. When he held onto the umbrella, he could sense his vitality pouring into the umbrella, instantly making his face pale.

“The dragon runes produced in the Blue Dragon Bone can’t keep up with the umbrella’s exhaustion…” When Lin Yun turned around, he noticed that the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder had disappeared along with his aura.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun executed the Heaven Sword Form, and the umbrella was like a sword sticking onto his back. When an ancient ‘Heaven’ word flew out, it blocked a blade ray. It was as though Lin Yun had a pair of eyes on the back of his head, briefly stunning the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder.

“Earth Sword Form!” Lin Yun turned around and swung the umbrella like a sword.

“Profound Sky Canon?—Asura Demon Slasher!” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder blocked Lin Yun’s attack before unleashing an even more terrifying attack. His pupils were filled with killing intent, and he had entered a maniac state because he never expected that he would be forced this far by a junior.

Spreading his palm apart, the umbrella began to revolve within Lin Yun’s hand while the first seal was lifted. The space between them had stretched apart, making the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder throw out a mouthful of blood.

“Brat, don’t use that umbrella and fight me openly if you have the guts!” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder roared, shocking everyone who heard him.

But just when he finished roaring, Lin Yun grabbed onto the umbrella and opened it up. Once again, the face of the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder became black and was caught by surprise, falling to one knee again.

Everyone was shocked by this scene because this battle involved ten-odd Samsara Edict Realm experts and over a hundred experts at the pinnacle Dragon Pulse Realm. That region had already fallen into chaos due to various phenomena and attacks. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But most of them were evenly matched, without anyone holding a significant advantage against their opponent. The only exception was Lin Yun’s battle. No one could have imagined that Lin Yun, who was at the Dragon Pulse Realm, would use a Sovereign Saint Artifact to force a powerhouse at the Profound Life Stage to this point.

“You bastard!” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder finally lost it and got back on his feet while being under the immense pressure.

As a cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, he closed the umbrella before slamming it down. Just like that, before the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder could vent out his fury, he was sent flying by Lin Yun once more.

Wielding the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, Lin Yun gave off the aura of a peerless sword. Dashing forth, he arrived before the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder.

“Go down!” While everyone was shocked from watching this fight, the sun and moon revolved while the umbrella smashed the dragon origin membrane covering the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder apart, shattering the latter’s internal organs.

“You…” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder fell to one knee and supported himself with his blade. He couldn’t believe that he would be defeated by Lin Yun even if the latter had a Sovereign Saint Artifact. This made no sense. But as he spoke, he threw out another mouthful of blood with fragments of his internal organs mixed in the blood.

This immediately left everyone dumbfounded. They could clearly tell that the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder was heavily injured and could no longer fight.

“How did he manage to do that when he’s only at the Dragon Pulse Realm? He shouldn’t be able to unleash so much of the Sovereign Saint Artifact’s power with his cultivation!”

“There’s something fishy about that Sovereign Saint Artifact!”

“Don’t forget that he’s the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path and received the inheritance of the Azure Dragon. That is a saint artifact of the Azure Dragon Clan, not to mention that he even grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. That Profound Sky Sect’s elder is a little too arrogant. He shouldn’t have treated Lin Yun lightly right from the start.”

“But this is still a little too unbelieveable…” Everyone in the surroundings still hadn’t recovered from their shock. But they didn’t know that the Sword Sect’s party, fighting the Profound Sky Sect, was even more shocked than them.

Wielding the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, Lin Yun took in a deep breath and turned to look at the main battlefield. If the battle continued, the losses would be severe, even if they managed to win. Since that was the case, he could only give it a risk.

But he realized that the dragon runes produced by the Blue Dragon Bone could no longer keep up with the exhaustion. So he could only execute the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella once more with his remaining vitality. Undoing the second restriction on the umbrella, he summoned the Azure Dragon souls within the umbrella.

Wielding the umbrella, Lin Yun poured all his vitality into it, and his face instantly became pale. But he still gritted his teeth to manipulate the dragon souls.

“Open!” When the aura given off by the umbrella reached the limit, Lin Yun let out a roar and opened his umbrella.

A starry sky appeared on the horizon with a pair of Azure Dragon’s eyes appearing, and the eyes had a crescent moon rune in them. Along with an explosion, nine Azure Dragons flew out from the umbrella.

“What’s going on?” When the nine dragons appeared, the faces of the two sects’ Samsara Edict Realm experts changed. But when they noticed that the nine dragons were charging at the Profound Sky Sect’s Samsara Edict Realm experts, everyone from the Sword Sect rejoiced.

“Retreat!” The Profound Sky Sect’s Grand Elder panicked because he could sense that the nine dragon souls were giving off a terrifying aura. Sensing the terrifying aura, even Zhuge Qingyun panicked.

But everything happened too quickly. When the nine dragons flew over, their movements became stiff, and their speed significantly slowed.

“Young friend, someone as young as you shouldn’t play with a Sovereign Saint Artifact.” A crisp laughter resounded, and a person appeared from the sky. This person had flawless features, and he looked exceptionally beautiful, which could pique the jealousy of any woman. He looked like he came from a beautiful painting.

When he reached out with his hand, the nine dragons were grabbed by his hand, and those dragons couldn’t move, no matter how they struggled.
