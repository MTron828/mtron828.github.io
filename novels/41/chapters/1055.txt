Chapter 1056 - Courting Humiliation

“Yue Weiwei, I’m here.” Lin Yun smiled brightly despite his tattered clothes. He slaughtered many people before finally fulfilling his promise.

Tears streamed down Yue Weiwei’s cheeks as she bit her lips. In the past, she was carefree and faced all situations with a smile. But now, she was crying out of heartache for Lin Yun and gratitude for his actions. She couldn’t say a word, so she firmly grabbed Lin Yun’s hands instead.

Right at this moment, Lil’ Red released a roar and transformed into the dracoape form. Its fur emitted a violent demonic luster that made many people fearful. Lil’ Red was now over thirty feet tall.

Before the dracoape, the Profound Dragon Python no longer looked that huge. So Lil’ Red grabbed the python and tore it in half. Lin Yun was surprised when he saw this scene. Although he knew that Lil’ Red had three forms, he was still surprised by the dracoape form. After all, it contained the dragon bloodline, just like all of Lil’ Red’s other forms. It seemed like there was something special about Lil’ Red’s bloodline.

“Big Brother Yun, we should leave right now,” said Yue Weiwei after looking around cautiously. Lin Yun had exhausted the majority of his vitality and even made use of the Azure Dragon True Bone. So he wasn’t exactly in good shape right now.

Then again, the Realm Son’s condition was ten times worse than Lin Yun’s condition. However, they weren’t the real cause of concern. There were other Realm Sons who could make a move against Lin Yun. They were a real threat since Lin Yun felt several ominous gazes while fighting the three Realm Sons.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun nodded his head before jumping onto Lil’ Red. “Let’s go.”

When Lil’ Red heard that, it threw out a punch to destroy all rubble in its way. The spectators froze in fear at Lil’ Red’s might. THey naturally had thoughts about Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone, but Lil’ Red made them pause.

“It’s actually a Scarlet Blood Dracoape!” Imperial Diagram Realm Son said with shock.

After transforming into its dracoape form, Lil’ Red’s eyes blazed with flames. Many people were tempted by Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone, but they had to think again if they wanted to pay the price to fight Lil’ Red.

Then, Lil’ Red leapt into the sky, forcing the crowd to watch Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei disappear. At this moment, the crowd couldn’t believe that Lin Yun actually managed to defeat three Realm Sons and take Yue Weiwei away. Even the gold ranking’s geniuses were nothing before him.

Additionally, Lin Yun made the Nether Divinity Realm Son kneel before him two times and then pinned the Realm Son into a rock with his sword. It was so unbelievable that it felt like a dream.

“H-he actually managed to accomplish it…how unbelievable.”

“Who else could compare to Lin Yun in the way of the sword?”

“He seemed injured though. He must be putting up a strong front, right?”

“Hard to say. I bet no one is willing to take the risk to test him. After all, he has that Scarlet Blood Dracoape with him.” The various experts in Wind Mound City began to discuss among themselves as they looked at Lin Yun with reverence. He was the only person in history that provoked the war realms.

But now, he had trampled on this legend, letting everyone know that the war realms couldn’t be provoked and it wasn’t a joke that he only needed one sword to kill.

“Who permitted you to leave?!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s voice sounded out, causing many people’s faces to change. Then, he appeared in front of Lin Yun with a pale face and a body covered with injuries.

Lil’ Red’s eyes flashed with fury as it stared at the Realm Son. The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s eyes flashed with fear because he still hadn’t recovered from his injuries.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun said coldly. If it wasn’t for his own injuries and the other Realm Sons that were around, he wouldn’t even bother wasting time with the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

His words made the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s face turn red with veins popping out of his forehead. As his chest heaved up and down, the Nether Divinity Realm Son said coldly, “Lin Yun, do you dare to fight me fairly?”

Lin Yun laughed when he heard that. “Interesting, you want to talk about fairness to me? What a joke. I’m really impressed at the thickness of your face.”

He had never seen such a shameless person, but he knew that the Nether Divinity Realm Son was planning. Clearly, he was afraid of Lil’ Red.

“Cut the crap, I’m asking if you dare!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son said coldly. His resilience shocked many people. After all, Lin Yun made him kneel twice in front of the crowd.

“Lin Yun, I’m asking if you dare!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son continued.

This made Lin Yun’s face change slightly because he could sense many gazes directed over. He knew that many people would think that he was afraid if he didn’t accept this challenge from the Nether Divinity Realm Son. At that time, the other Realm Sons might even make a move.

“Since you’re courting humiliation, I’ll fulfill your wish,” said Lin Yun. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Haha, well said. You want to slap my face? Impossible!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son roared and unleashed a terrifying aura from his body. Lin Yun had already become a thorn in his heart and everyone knew that he was the one behind this entire trap.

When he was done, the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s aura began to surge and shine. The blood jade in his aura oceans could be faintly seen along with a Demonic Astral Flower. In total, he had three Demonic Astral Flowers in his five aura oceans, plus he also had a saint rune.

“Demonic Astral Flower!” Many people were surprised that the Nether Divinity Realm Son subdued the Demonic Astral Flowers. After all, those with the Demonic Astral Flowers in their aura oceans would undergo a transformation.

“Lin Yun, don’t blame me for bullying you!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son laughed as his Demonic Astral Flowers began to blaze. With afterimages forming around him, the Nether Divinity Realm Son looked extraordinary. Then, he turned into a light beam and charged towards Lin Yun.

Standing on the Scarlet Blood Dracoape, Lin Yun squinted his eyes and allowed the Nether Divinity Realm Son to charge towards him. But when the Nether Divinity Realm Son was about to approach, Lin Yun raised his hand while two Demonic Astral Flowers bloomed each in his four aura oceans. When the Demonic Astral Flowers began to blaze, Lin Yun also started to emit a glow that made him look like a deity.

Two Demonic Astral Flowers in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm?! The Nether Divinity Realm Son squinted his eyes because Lin Yun was only in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, yet he managed to refine two Demonic Astral Flowers in each of his aura oceans. The Nether Divinity Realm Son felt shivers in the face of reality.

“Come here!” Lin Yun’s roar sounded out just when the Nether Divinity Realm Son was about to retreat. Raising his hand, he dragged the Nether Divinity Realm Son through the air. Then, his palm landed on the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s face. It was a resounding slap that caused the Nether Divinity Realm Son to throw up a mouthful of blood before collapsing onto the ground.

“This is just a small token of my anger. Next time, I’ll take your lifeLin Yun looked at the Nether Divinity Realm Son coldly before the Scarlet Blood Dracoape left.
