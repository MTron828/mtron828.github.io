Chapter 1004 - Fortune Obtained

Lin Yun’s figure was frozen in mid-air. If it wasn’t for the pair of golden wings maintaining his elevation, he probably would have fallen from the sky.

After Yu Haotian chased the demonic spirit out and managed to regain control of his body, he threw up a mouthful of blood. His injuries were more serious than he had imagined, especially now that his regenerated chest started to wither.

His wound broke apart and his heart was revealed, which brought him pain every time his heart throbbed. Yu Haotian’s eyes were full of despair because his body was practically crippled. Even if he managed to recover from his injuries, there was no way he could recover his cultivation. This meant that he would be stuck in the Heavenly Soul Realm for the rest of his life. If he didn’t have a saint pellet or extraordinary means, he would become a cripple.

But how could Yu Haotian accept that? His eyes blazed with hatred for the demonic spirit and the culprit, Lin Yun. When he looked at Lin Yun, his eyes began to flicker.

Lin Yun was frozen still as he was currently being attacked by the demonic spirit. But even so, he was enveloped with sword intent that would attack anyone who threatened him. If Yu Haotian was in his top condition, he naturally wouldn’t be afraid of the sword intent around Lin Yun. But with one foot in the grave, he had to be careful.

Right at this moment, a few figures flew over. It was Luo Chen’s group whom he had humiliated earlier. So without any hesitation, he turned around and ran for his life.

“What’s going on?” Luo Chen’s group looked at Lin Yun as their faces changed.

“He’s being possessed!” Pei Xue said with her brows locked.

“What?!” Luo Chen’s group were shocked as they realized what was going on. The demonic spirit possessing Yu Haotian must’ve forsaken Yu Haotian for Lin Yun.

“Go after Yu Haotian first. We can’t let him escape. The demonic spirit was forced to a dead-end and is trying to possess Lin Yun. I’ll wait here for the outcome,” said Pei Xue.

When Luo Chen’s group heard that, they sighed in relief because they knew that chasing after Yu Haotian was more important. After all, they were all humiliated by Yu Haotian, especially Jun Mengchen.

After the three of them left, Pei Xue had concern flashing across her pupils. Although the demonic spirit was heavily injured, it was still dangerous for Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun would be heavily injured if his soul was slightly affected. But looking at Lin Yun, her eyes were filled with amazement, “It’s not easy for an extraordinary genius to appear in the Heavenly Path. You can’t fall here…”

As for Lin Yun, the light in his eyes gradually faded because there was a demonic light chasing after his soul. This was the first time Lin Yun had encountered such a situation, so he could only run for his life. “Damn it!”

“Hehe, don’t worry. I’m from the noble Divine Ultan Race. It’s your honor to merge with me. Hand over your body obediently! It’s a waste for you to have the Azure Dragon True Bone. I’ll reach the top of the Heavenly Path rankings on your behalf. At that time, everyone will know your name!” The demonic spirit laughed within Lin Yun’s mind.

The demonic spirit was in a terrible state and was taking a risk by trying to possess Lin Yun because it was certain that Lin Yun definitely didn’t understand much about the soul. It was only a matter of time before he devoured Lin Yun’s soul. It was a risky move, but it could turn the battle around.

“Get lost! My body isn’t for someone like you!” Lin Yun flew into a rage as he tried his best to find a solution. But in the end, he couldn’t find any solutions.

“Hahaha! There’s nothing you can do about it! Let me see how long you can stay arrogant. Your body will be mine sooner or later! But don’t worry, I’ll kill Yu Haotian on your behalf!” The demonic spirit’s eerie voice sounded out as it charged towards Lin Yun. In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun was forced into a dead-end. Facing immense pressure, Lin Yun felt like his soul was about to dissipate. However, there was nothing he could do.

He couldn’t use his origin energy or sword intent in this mysterious space. Although he could feel that he could use spiritual runes to defend himself, his attainments as a spiritualist were too low for him to do anything. He was only a third-grade spiritualist, so there was nothing he could do about the demonic spirit. Most importantly, he had never used spiritual runes under this situation before and failed when he tried.

“Hehe. You’re still too weak to annihilate me with spiritual runes!” The demonic spirit sneered at how hard Lin Yun tried to use spiritual runes. But right at this moment, an Azure Firmament Tree appeared with countless purple flower petals blooming on it. At the top of the tree sat an ice phoenix that emitted a terrifying aura.

“Violet Ice Sparrow?” Lin Yun was shocked when he saw the phoenix. He knew that he could summon it upon reaching a higher level in the Iris Sword Sutra. He also knew that he would be able to grasp the Iris Sacred Flame. But he never expected that there would be the soul of an ice phoenix sitting in the depth of his mind.

Unlike his martial souls, he could sense intelligence coming from this sleeping phoenix. Just what the hell is going on? Is there really such a secret in the Iris Sword Sutra left behind by the Iris Sword Saint? This caused a huge shock in Lin Yun’s heart because he didn’t expect this.

Just how long had the ice phoenix been here? Did it show up ever since he reverse circulated the Iris Sword Array nine times for the first time? In that split second, Lin Yun was filled with countless questions that he even forgot about the demonic spirit.

“A-Ancient Phoenix Clan…” The demonic spirit began to tremble upon seeing the ice phoenix. He could sense an eerie aura emitting from the ice phoenix. At this moment, he regretted his actions from the bottom of his heart.

Meanwhile, Luo Chen’s group of three were chasing after Yu Haotian. Luo Chen and Qin Lin looked at Yu Haotian eerily. Jun Mengchen’s face was cold while looking at Yu Haotian, “Yu Haotian, there’s no way you can escape.”

Yu Haotian swept his glance at the three of them before he calmed down and sneered, “Taking advantage of my current state? I might be in a terrible state, but the likes of you can’t do anything to me! Get lost now or I’ll make all three of you cry!”

His injuries weren’t light, but the injuries on Luo Chen’s group of three weren’t light either. He had heavily injured the three of them before they were saved by Pei Xue. So there was no way they could recover their fighting prowess so quickly.

“Hmph! Why don’t you look at your current condition?” Qin Lin said with a cold light flashing through his pupils. The three of them might be injured, but they were in better shape than Yu Haotian. Yu Haotian was badly injured and his chest had a huge wound. Furthermore, the demonic spirit even over-exhausted his foundation. So in the eyes of Luo Chen’s group, Yu Haotian was on his last leg.

“Hehe. My injuries were caused by Lin Yun. Not you guys! You’re nothing!” Yu Haotian sneered and began to push himself once more despite his injuries. In that split second, silver moonlight shined from within his body as he executed the Phaseless Demonic Art. Then, he turned into an azure dragon and charged towards Luo Chen’s group of three.

Luo Chen’s group was shocked that Yu Haotian would still execute a movement technique. When the azure dragon swung its tail, Yu Haotian’s palm landed on Jun Mengchen’s chest and sent him flying.

Then, the azure dragon turned around and hit Qin Lin square in the chest. With a roar, the dragon appeared before Luo Chen. Throwing a punch with the Divine Shadow Glove, Yu Haotian caused Luo Chen to retaliate. Under the collision of fists, Luo Chen was sent flying out a hundred meters away and then fell to his knees.

“Three pieces of trash. You guys think you guys can take me down just because I’m in this state? If I was at my strongest state, I could easily crush you with a single finger,” sneered Yu Haotian. If he wasn’t injured, the three of them would be dead by now.

But before he could finish, a black figure dashed over and sent him flying away before he could even react. When Yu Haotian vomited blood, the crack on his heart grew even bigger. With such heavy injuries, there was no way he could use the Divine Shadow Glove anymore. Unable to hold the glove, Yu Haotian let it slide out of his hands. However, the black figure took this opportunity and snatched the glove.

“You again! You stupid cat!” Yu Haotian coughed and raised his head to look at Lin Yun’s pet.

Lil’ Red grinned and took out the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff. Upon seeing the staff, Yu Haotian’s face changed drastically. Instantly, he ran for his life. However, he was ultimately one step too slow and took a hit from Lil’ Red. Cracks appeared on his skeleton as his interspatial pouch fell to the ground.

With a flash, Lil’ Red grabbed hold of the interspatial pouch while Yu Haotian bore the pain and executed his movement technique. In the next second, he had manifested into an azure dragon and started fleeing for his life.

Unfortunately for Yu Haotian, there was no way that Lil’ Red could let this opportunity go. It chased after Yu Haotian and only stopped an hour later. Lil’ Red had arrived at a barren land enveloped in black clouds. The land emitted a forbidden aura that made Li’ Red stop.

At this moment, Luo Chen’s group arrived on the scene. All three of them sucked in a cold breath when they saw the barren land enveloped in black clouds.

“That’s the forbidden zone…”

“Yu Haotian went in?”

“Then there’s no way he can survive. He’s practically on his deathbed. I can’t believe he went in. This forbidden zone has existed since ancient times and even Divine Core Realm’s powerhouse can’t survive it.”

“Yu Haotian will die for sure. Even if he doesn’t die, he’ll be crippled. Plus, he was heavily injured by Lin Yun. So there’s no way he can survive this.” Luo Chen’s group of three talked among themselves with full confidence that Yu Haotian was dead.

After all, his Divine Shadow Glove and interspatial pouch were stolen by Lil’ Red. Yu Haotian was extraordinary with great fortune, but all his fortune had fallen in the hands of Lin Yun.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
