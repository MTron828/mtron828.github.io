Chapter 818 - Azure Dragon Sword Aura

Everyone felt immense pressure from the killing aura in Zhao Wuji’s eyes.

Bai Lixuan’s attacks were powerful despite having his lightning intent being suppressed. He managed to rely on his Azure Dragon Sword Sutra and his sword technique to injure Zhao Wuji. If Zhao Wuji didn’t also grasp the cloud intent, he surely would have been heavily injured.

Geniuses like Lin Yun could tell that Zhao Wuji was already at his limit when he faced Bai Lixuan’s second attack and that there was no way he could take the third attack head-on. But Zhao Wuji’s words made everyone think that he was about to bring out his true strength.

Bai Lixuan was briefly surprised before his face turned nasty. He never thought that Zhao Wuji would really let him have three moves. With his pride, he felt humiliated.

Lin Yun, who was observing the battle, knew that Bai Lixuan fell for Zhao Wuji’s scheme. Zhao Wuji’s words were like a seed planted in Bai Lixuan’s heart, which made the latter lose his composure. Bai Lixuan was already weaker in terms of his aura, not to mention that he lost his composure.

“Lightning and cloud as one!” Zhao Wuji suddenly roared as his lightning intent and cloud intent began to fuse. In the next second, a black vortex with magma-like lightning fused with the clouds. The aura coming from his combined intent was a lot stronger than Bai Lixuan.

Then, an even more terrifying scene occurred. Bai Lixuan was horrified to discover that half of his lightning intent was devoured by the vortex, which meant that his lightning sword intent was slowly crumbling.

“No…” Bai Lixuan finally panicked as he tried to circulate his origin energy to gather his lightning sword intent.

“Let's end this.” Zhao Wuji snapped and the lightning cloud intent exploded like a supernova. This instantly sent Bai Lixuan flying. As a last resort, Bai Lixuan empowered his sword with pure sword intent and all the radiance from his saint physique that he could muster. With this last act of desperation, he threw his sword as hard as he could.

This caught Zhao Wuji by surprise, but he merely leaned his head to the side to dodge the sword. In the end, Bai Lixuan only managed to cut a few strands of Zhao Wuji’s hair while leaving a tiny cut on his cheek. The sword shot past Zhao Wuji, but he was still faster than the sword as he turned around to grab it. Once it was in his possession, he threw it back at Bai Lixuan.

After Bai Lixuan collapsed, his sword stabbed the ground one inch away from his face. Bai Lixuan could still hear the sword humming in his ears and knew that he was one inch away from death. His face paled because he knew that Zhao Wuji went easy on him.

“Zhao Wuji wins!” Not giving Bai Lixuan any time to lament, the judge announced the brutal outcome. With the victor determined, Zhao Wuji devoured half of Bai Lixuan’s profound amber aura and his dragon projection gained a fourth claw.

“This is too exciting! Zhao Wuji is really strong!”

“His lightning intent and cloud intent are practically at xiantian complete mastery. He’s just one step away from the spiritual stage.”

“The spiritual stage? He still has a long way to go. It’s not easy to make a breakthrough with intent. It’s even harder to reach the spiritual stage before the Heavenly Soul Realm. Otherwise, Zhao Wuji wouldn’t bother comprehending cloud intent.”

“Zhao Wuji is strong, but that doesn’t mean Bai Lixuan is weak. I almost thought he was going to win.”

“Bai Lixuan isn’t weak, especially since he injured Zhao Wuji with his second sword. It’s a shame that he lost.”

“I’m afraid no one can defeat the three kings.” The audience was briefly stunned before they broke out into an uproar. After all, they felt their hearts clench as they watched the battle. Even if Zhao Wuji maintained a low profile, he also gave everyone the feeling that he couldn’t be defeated.

The gap between the three kings and the dark horses was too great. Only someone like Jiang Ziye could challenge the three kings. After a brief pause, the judge made another announcement, “Next battle, Lin Yun VS Wu Xiaotian!”

The crowd was silent before they broke out in cheers for Lin Yun. Right now, Wu Xiaotian’s popularity was at an all time low because he lost to Fang Hanluo. His cheers couldn’t compare to Lin Yun’s cheers. However, no one thought he was weak.

Furthermore, Wu Xiaotian’s ultimate move left a deep impression on the audience because it wasn’t much weaker than Bai Lixuan’s Azure Dragon Rage. In his previous battles, Jiang Ziye domineeringly dissolved his attack while Fang Hanluo found a flaw in it. So the crowd was curious to see how Lin Yun would deal with it.

Looking at Lin Yun on the stage, Wu Xiaotian admitted his mistake as he said, “I told you before that you wouldn’t get far in the banquet if you continued on your path, but you proved me wrong. Just know that it won’t be easy to defeat me because I’ve perfected my move, even more, thanks to Fang Hanluo!”

Wu Xiaotian knew that his odds of winning weren't high, but he would never surrender. Furthermore, it wouldn’t be easy for Lin Yun to defeat him either.

“It won’t be hard,” replied Lin Yun. He had a pretty good relationship with Wu Xiaotian, so he didn’t want to lie. No matter how profound Wu Xiaotian’s attack was, it wasn’t enough to threaten him. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Wu Xiaotian’s smile froze before his eyes flashed coldly with a sinister smile, “It’s taboo to be careless in a fight. You’re giving me an opportunity.”

You...really think too much. Lin Yun said inwardly before he spoke out, “Let’s do this.”

“Blood Annihilation” Crimson light exploded from Wu Xiaotian that manifested into a dragon. This time, the dragon he manifested was a lot stronger than before.

With a flash, Wu Xiaotian charged towards Lin Yun as his fist radiated like the sun. At the same time, the dragon coiled around him and its head overlapped with Wu Xiaotian’s fist, turning his somewhat handsome face sinister.

But before Wu Xiaotian could take a step forward, a boundless sword ray descended. Lin Yun didn’t bother drawing his sword and merely pushed his right hand out. Once the sword ray descended, Wu Xiaotian was surprised to see the boundless sword ray manifest into a dragon’s claw.

The dragon’s claw was shrouded in wind and lightning energies before it turned into a sword once again. Just like that, Wu Xiaotian was sent flying as his demonic aura crumbled before he even took one step forward. Lin Yun was also surprised because the power of his attack was much greater than he thought it would be.

“What’s going on?” Wu Xiaotian’s eyes flickered before he gnashed his teeth and charged forward.

In the blink of an eye, Wu Xiaotian and Lin Yun exchanged over a dozen moves. Although Lin Yun didn’t draw his sword, his sword aura was everywhere. He gave others the feeling that every single one of his attacks was a sharp claw that could tear through space.

Ten moves later, Lin Yun’s body crackled with lightning before he stabbed out with his fingers like a sword. As a dragon roar echoed out, Wu Xiaotian threw up a mouthful of blood and was sent flying.

This scene left many people surprised because Lin Yun was actually able to suppress Wu Xiaotian without using his sword. In just a few days, Lin Yun became much stronger than when he fought against Nangong Wanyu.

“Nine Dragons Heavenly Crusher!” Wu Xiaotian roared and slammed his palm on the ground, executing his ultimate move again.

Everyone saw nine majestic dragons that empowered Wu Xiaotian’s fist. The dragons danced through the air under Wu Xiaotian’s control as they enveloped the stage in crimson radiance.

Lin Yun didn’t move and merely raised his brow when Wu Xiaotian was a hundred meters away from him. Wind and lightning roared and the azure dragon’s wind and lightning energies filled every corner of the stage. Then, Lin Yun’s sword intent manifested into an azure dragon over 300 meters long with eyes that flickered with sword ray.

Looking at this scene, Wu Xiaotian’s jaw dropped and his mind went blank. Compared to Lin Yun’s azure dragon, the dragons he manifested were no different from eels. All Lin Yun did was glance at Wu Xiaotian and the nine dragons he manifested began to crumble.

Although Lin Yun didn’t move, Wu Xiaotian felt as though he was punched in the chest as his face turned pale and he threw up blood. Just when he was about to fly off of the stage, Wu Xiaotian fell on his knees and coughed, looking at Lin Yun with reluctance.

At this moment, Lin Yun’s hair was fluttering in the wind. He looked like a deity as he stood straight like a sword under the azure dragon.
