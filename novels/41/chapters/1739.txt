Chapter 1740 – Come At Me Together!

The Nirvana Stage was filled with people the following day. After yesterday, only three hundred-odd out of ten thousand people were left. This meant more than ninety percent of the people were eliminated in one day, and anyone could see how brutal this banquet was. But there was no doubt that the three hundred people remaining were all geniuses standing at the top of the pyramid.

Undoubtedly, the battle today would be a hundredfold more brilliant than yesterday. When everyone came to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, the other forces’ geniuses were already waiting.

When Lin Yun appeared, he could sense several gazes on him, including the Heavenly Flame Sect’s Qin Hao. He didn’t bother concealing his relationship with Hua Hongyu today, and stood in the Myriad Flowers Hall with her, publicly disclosing their relationship.

But Lin Yun completely disregarded Qin Hao. His gaze was on the Ming Cult’s Li Yuxi. When Yue Weiwei slapped his face yesterday, the grudge was on his head. Aside from that, there were also the Divine Dao Pavilion’s Zhang Ying and the Myriad Lightning Sect’s Chen Jun who stood out on Qin Hao’s side. They were both looking at him with hostility and determined to teach him a lesson today for his arrogance yesterday.

That was especially so for Qin Hao, who wanted to teach Lin Yun on the spot. Not long later, the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master and elders came. After everyone bowed, the pavilion master nodded his head with a smile.

But this caught Yue Weiwei’s attention because she discovered that the pavilion master took several glances at Lin Yun.

“Let’s begin.” The pavilion master smiled.

On the Nirvana Stage, the elders sorted the list of those who won yesterday, and they had jade slips hovering above them. An old man said, “Today is the second round of the Nirvana Banquet, and we will determine the top hundred. Aside from that, I will also call out fifteen names who will make it to the final round.”

Through the battle yesterday, the Heavenly Nirvana Banquet elders discovered several people who were stronger than others. For them, it was a waste of time for them to continue in the second round because anyone else would be defeated if they ran into them, and they wouldn’t be able to unleash their full strength.

For example, if those with the potential of entering the top hundred ran into them, they might not be able to make it into the top hundred. After coming this far, those fifteen people no longer needed to prove themselves.

Everyone instantly knew what the pavilion master meant. They wanted to pick out the seeded candidates so that even the weakest among them could make it into the top thirty.

“Li Yuxi.” An elder announced. But no one was surprised by this, including Li Yuxi himself.

“Chen Jun, Zhang Ying, Qin Hao…” More names were being called out, and everyone’s faces gradually changed. The seeded candidates were practically holy land geniuses and were in the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Aside from music dao, they also had strong martial cultivation. They were almost invincible, even amongst those of the same generation.

Everyone’s gazes gradually became dim. The music dao’s geniuses naturally had a considerable disadvantage against them. This was simple to understand. If one cultivated in music and martial dao simultaneously, they naturally held a higher advantage than those who only cultivated in one. Not to mention some geniuses managed to fuse their martial intent into music dao.

When the seeded candidates were called out, the second round of the Nirvana Banquet officially began. Thirty people would fight amongst themselves in each match, and the three who remained standing on the stage would make it to the next round. Then again, there may only be one person.

“Junior Brother Lin’s name isn’t on the list?” Lin Wan furrowed her brows. Even Luo Shuyi was also baffled because half of the candidates were given to holy land geniuses, and Lin Yun wasn’t amongst them. Even Yan Tianchen and Yue Weiwei weren’t amongst the fifteen.

Yan Tianchen furrowed his brows and shook his head, “They seem to be listed out because of their martial cultivation. This means the Nirvana Banquet has changed. There isn’t a distinct line between martial and music dao.”

Lin Yun wasn’t bothered about that, and he didn’t mind fighting another round. As long as he was strong enough, it didn’t matter whether he was a seeded candidate or not. When he bumped gazes with Yue Weiwei, he saw a smile blooming on her face.

This made Lin Yun briefly stunned. He nodded his head before turning away. He still hadn’t recovered from what happened yesterday, and he was conflicted when he saw Yue Weiwei. He kept wondering if he was worthy of Yue Weiwei’s selfless love.

On the other hand, Yue Weiwei was disappointed with her smile disappearing. There was an invisible barrier between them, and the barrier was gradually becoming bigger.

As the Nirvana Banquet continued, it was finally Yan Tianchen’s turn on the third match. When Yan Tianchen went on the stage, it instantly caused an uproar. If it weren’t for Lin Yun’s performance yesterday, Yan Tianchen would definitely be the center of attention. Even so, many people felt Yan Tianchen, who could trounce Di Qiu, might be stronger than Lin Yun.

“Come at me together.” Yan Tianchen said to the twenty-nine people.

Everyone was shocked when they heard that because that was an arrogant declaration. Everyone who could make it to the second round was strong. So where did Yan Tianchen get his confidence from?

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he didn’t notice that Yan Tianchen was so arrogant before.

Everyone else on the Nirvana Stage unhappily looked at Yan Tianchen. Was everyone from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion so arrogant? Most importantly, two amongst the twenty-nine were popular candidates for making it into the top ten.

One of them was Xie Feichen, and the other was Xiao Mingliang. The former was only second to the Flying Snow Pavilion’s chief disciple, and the latter was the strongest of the Seven Exquisite Palace. If it weren’t for their cultivation being their weakness, they would definitely be considered seeded candidates, and their attainment in music dao wasn’t at all inferior to those fifteen.

“Allow me!” Xie Feichen stood out and charged at Yan Tianchen. When he was in mid-air, he blew his bamboo flute and summoned a demonic ape behind him. When Xie Feichen approached, those around Yan Tianchen felt tremendous pressure and quickly left.

“Xie Feichen is making a move!” The audience’s eyes lit up, looking forward to this fight. After all, Yan Tianchen didn’t even use his musical instrument before. So everyone was looking forward to seeing how strong Yan Tianchen was. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

As beastial roars echoed from the Nirvana Stage, the roars overlapped with his flute music, and the massive demonic ape became even more realistic before sending a palm towards Yan Tianchen. But Yan Tianchen had no change on his face. He took out a bamboo flute before tapping his foot on the ground and retreating.

When flute music resounded, a crimson-armored general appeared behind him before clashing with the demonic ape. There was nothing fancy about their music. After ten-odd moves later, they both crossed each other, causing a huge commotion on the Nirvana Stage. When the two pieces of music clashed, a terrifying crimson shockwave swept out.

In the next second, the crimson-armored general created a hole in the demonic ape’s chest with a punch. When they crossed paths once more, Xie Feichen fell onto one knee.

“This…!” Everyone was shocked when they saw this scene.

Xie Feichen supported himself on the ground with both hands. His face was pale, and he threw out blood.

On the other hand, Yan Tianchen continued to play the flute, and a crimson light swept through the stage. When everyone saw his back figure, it made him look like a ghost general who came from hell. This made everyone’s faces change, and more people began to give up or were sent off the Nirvana Stage.

Very quickly, Xiao Mingliang was the only one left on the stage. As for Xie Feichen, he was carried off the stage by his fellow disciples.

“Wind!” Xiao Mingliang roared, and he rose to the sky. An invisible air current formed into a five-colored wind that enveloped him and lifted him to the sky. This gradually made everyone’s faces change because Xiao Mingliang’s Wind Intent was slowly fusing into his music dao. This was something that no one had expected.
