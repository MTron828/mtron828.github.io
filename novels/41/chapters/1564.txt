Chapter 1565 - I Don't Care Who You Are!

Everyone naturally recognized Huang Xuanyi, first on the Elysium Core Ranking. After all, his portrait was on the Elysium Core Ranking, hung on the first position for many years, and everyone was already used to it.

Furthermore, he was a disciple of a holy land. He came from the holy land, Ming Cult, beyond the Ancient Barren Domain. Everyone was dumbfounded because no one expected Haung Xuanyi to appear at the Heavenly Pool Gathering. After all, this resource belonged to their Ancient Barren Domain!

“Luo Yuan, what are you trying to do?! He’s not a disciple of your Profound Sky Sect!” Mu Xueqin roared as she stood up. How were they going to compete with Huang Xuanyi here? Huang Xuanyi was ranked first on the Elysium Core Ranking and practically invincible. She also didn’t think Lin Yun would have any odds of winning. He might be turned into a disabled person in this fight if he wasn't careful.

The faces of the other sects changed. After all, who could accept someone who wasn’t from the Ancient Barren Domain to take a resource that belonged to them? Thus, everyone’s gazes fell onto the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord.

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord’s face began to change. He also felt that this masked man’s identity was a little weird, but he didn’t overthink it. He naturally became furious when Huang Xuanyi’s identity was revealed, and the Profound Sky Sect was clearly breaking the rules here!

Luo Yuan had already expected this, so he said, “Saint Lord, you don’t have to worry. Huang Xuanyi is now a disciple of my Profound Sky Sect, since he has already left the Ming Cult to join us. My master permitted it, and this here is a letter from my master.”

“Fuck, this is too shameless!”

“This works? They’re clearly pushing it! The Profound Sky Sect is a traitor. What benefit will they get from doing this?!”

“They’re too much!” Everyone was furious when they heard what Luo Yuan said.

When the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord saw the letter, he knew this was just a procedure, and Huang Xuanyi couldn't leave the Ming Cult. With his aptitude, the Ming Cult wouldn’t allow him to go, so he’s naturally here for the baptism before entering the Dragon Pulse Realm. This would ensure that he would reach a higher level when making a breakthrough.

But despite knowing that, the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord couldn’t find a reason to refute what Luo Yuan said. Most importantly, he couldn’t afford to offend Tian Xuanzi.

“Since he’s a recommendation from the Saint Sovereign, it’s not considered spoiling the rules.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord stowed the letter, then said, “Lin Yun, you can back down now.”

This was goodwill from the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord, and no one couldn’t refute this. After all, who would still dare to fight Huang Xuanyi? His cultivation at the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm was enough to suppress everyone present, so they could only suck it up even if they were unhappy about it.

“I haven’t lost yet. So why should I back down?” Lin Yun replied. His words instantly left everyone shocked. When they looked at Lin Yun again, they couldn’t see any surprise on his face upon seeing Huang Xuanyi’s identity. It was as though he initially knew he was fighting Huang Xuanyi.

But everyone couldn’t help feeling strange shortly after. If Lin Yun already knew that he was fighting Huang Xuanyi, where did he get the confidence to challenge him?

“Not admitting defeat even after knowing my identity. The Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple is truly courageous.” Huang Xuanyi commented with a playful smile.

“Cut the crap. If you want the Sword Sect to admit defeat, you'll have to defeat me. After all, my sword doesn’t give a damn about who you are!” Lin Yun replied.

“Haha.” Huang Xuanyi smiled. “I really want to play with you, but I don’t have the time to do so. Let’s end the game now!”

Huang Xuanyi no longer concealed his cultivation now that his identity was exposed. As the stars in his violet palace lit up, a nine-star heavenly Elysium Core Realm aura exploded. Even from a distance away, the other sects’ disciples felt an immense pressure crashing down on them. Even the faces of the Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses changed, with fear flashing across their pupils.

“Junior Brother Lin, come back!” Mu Xueqin yelled. But the moment she was done, a nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm aura exploded from Lin Yun and the two auras collided on the stage, causing the entire sky to turn dark.

“How is this possible?!” Exclamations came from Nangong Yan, Chang Yun, Ning Feng, Tang Jing, and others. They couldn’t believe Lin Yun had reached the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

“What’s going on?!” Luo Yuan was also shocked while looking at Lin Yun. If he remembered correctly, Lin Yun had just reached the Elysium Core Realm a year ago. But now, his cultivation was already comparable to Huang Xuanyi.

Mu Xueqin was shocked, and her eyes were shining brightly. She knoew something didn’t feel right with Lin Yun when they met again in the Sword Sect, and she now had her answer. But this outcome was still shocking because Lin Yun was at the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm!

On the stage, Huang Xuanyi’s face became grave and the contempt in his eyes disappeared. “It looks like I’ve underestimated you. You’re truly worthy of being the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple.”

“Your strength is pretty decent, so it’s no wonder why you’re first on the Elysium Core Ranking. But there’s nothing impressive about you. You’re still too tender to claim to be invincible.” Lin Yun said.

Huang Xuanyi’s face was ugly when he heard that. He was the disciple of a holy land, but Lin Yun talked with a tone as though he were superior. Huang Xuanyi snorted and started forming seals, “Hmph. I’ll play with you if you want to play. Do you really think I became first on the Elysium Core Ranking by relying on my cultivation?”

Practically at the same time, a moon and a sun condensed with lightning rose behind him, shining brightly. When the sun and moon merged, they became an ancient ‘Ming’ word. On the surface of the ‘Ming’ word, terrifying saint runes began to appear, and this word alone was comparable to a terrifying myriad rune saint artifact.

As the ten thousand runes intertwined, a giant screen appeared behind the sun and moon that condensed into a massive ‘Ming’ word. The word looked a thousand feet in height from afar, emitting the sun and moon radiance. The ‘Ming’ word then suppressed everything on the stage, including Lin Yun, who was also on the stage.

“Light Destruction Divine Array! That’s the Ming Cult’s high-grade ghost spirit martial technique. That Huang Xuanyi isn’t simple to set up such a huge array. It looks like he received the true inheritance of the Ming Cult.”

“Huang Xuanyi is strong, to begin with. With the help of this array, it’ll be difficult for Lin Yun to defeat him.”

“This isn’t only an array, it’s also a saint artifact. According to the Ming Cult, it should be called the Divine Sun Moon Altar!” Not even a Dragon Pulse Realm genius might be able to reach such a high level in a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Huang Xuanyi had shocked everyone with this move, and they now knew why he was first on the Elysium Core Ranking. Just this alone, who could suppress him in the same cultivation? When the ‘Ming’ word was crashing down, Lin Yun’s body trembled. He felt as though his bones were about to shatter.

This ‘Ming’ word was similar to his Heaven Sword Form while being constructed with the sun and moon. Since it had over ten thousand saint runes engraved on it, it was way more potent than the Heaven Sword Form.

“Lin Yun, it’s your honor to die from experiencing the secret technique of the Ming Cult!” Huang Xuanyi sneered with a chill flashing through his pupils. He pushed his palms forth when he was done talking and the ‘Ming’ word was pressed down. “Sun Moon Radiance!”

When the ‘Ming’ word came crashing down, more cracks appeared on the stage, and all the disciples in the surrounding pavilions felt an immense pressure as they began to tremble.

Facing the danger head-on, Lin Yun realized a blazing aura surging from the Blue Dragon Bone. As his blood began to boil, the tremendous pressure was slowly triggering the power of the Blue Dragon Bone.

With a slight change on his face, Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art. When he circulated it nine times, a draconic roar echoed from Lin Yun’s body, and that roar made many Elysium Core Realm disciples in the surrounding pavilions throw out a mouthful of blood.

“Azure Dragon Grasp!” Lin Yun roared. Two thousand dragon runes then surged from the Blue Dragon Bone, making his arm feel heavy. His entire arm began to transform into the arm of a divine dragon as the dragon runes formed into densely packed blue dragon scales.

When he clenched his fist, a draconic roar echoed from the horizon as a gigantic dragon claw tore through the ‘Ming’ word. When the ‘Ming’ word was destroyed, the sun and moon flew away and the enormous dragon claw flew toward Huang Xuanyi’s head.

“Damn it!” Huang Xuanyi’s speed was much faster. He quickly summoned the lightning vortex, and an ancient seal flew out, hovering before his hands. It was the Great Sun Seal. With the empowerment of the Great Sun Seal, he used his fingers as a sword and destroyed the azure dragon’s claw. But the shockwave from the explosion still sent him flying back and his hair was scattered into a mess, making his face ugly.

“Heaven Sword Form!” But before Huang Xuanyi could stand up, Lin Yun soared to the sky and used his sword to write a ‘Heaven’ word. When the heavenly pressure came crashing down, Huang Xuanyi fell to his knees.

But he didn’t panic and waved his hand, summoning the sun over and collided it with the ‘Heaven’ word.

“Earth Sword Form!” When the ‘Heaven’ word was destroyed, the gravity on the stage multiplied by seventy-two times.

“Break!” Huang Xuanyi slammed his palm on the ground while throwing a mouthful of blood. The moon came crashing down like a meteorite, shattering the ‘Earth’ word before smashing the stage into pieces.

“Divine Sun Moon Altar!” Huang Xuanyi used the rebound force from his palm to hover in the air before waving his hand. As the scattered sun and moon converged in his hand, they manifested into an altar, and he threw it over to Lin Yun, smashing everything in its path into pieces.

“You can have it back!” Lin Yun gently tapped his foot on the shattered stage and swung his sword around. When a ‘Profound’ word appeared on the Flower Burial Sword, the sword bent like an arrow before it rebounded, and the Divine Sun Moon Altar flew back to Huang Xuanyi at an even more terrifying speed.

“Fuck!” Huang Xuanyi’s face paled when he saw this scene.
