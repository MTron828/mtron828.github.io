Chapter 1268 - Humiliation

Lin Yun had instantly discovered Gongsun Yan, who had been secretly following him. The latter was cautious, retracting his aura and would even occasionally change his location to avoid his discovery. But there was no way Gongsun Yan’s tricks could hide his presence from Lin Yun.

The divine firmament sword intent could be used as a radar. He had even used it to sense Feng Jue, who was at the Samsara Edict Realm, with it, not to mention Gongsun Yan, who was only at the Empyrean Realm. But Lin Yun paid no attention to Gongsun Yan and continued his journey.

He was surprised that the entire journey was smooth with no guards around. After all, previously, he would occasionally encounter disciples from the big sects. But when he got close, they didn’t bother to make a move against him and allowed him the climb the mountain. There weren’t any guards on the mountain, and those whom he encountered along the way would look at him like a dead person.

“Can it be that those on the mountain are terrifyingly strong? Is that why they have the confidence to let me climb the mountain?” No matter what Lin Yun thought about it, he could only explain it in this manner.

Very quickly, he reached the summit of the mountain that was enveloped in silver snow. There was a massive array nearby that isolated the aura and also prevented the Dragon Blood Fruit from escaping upon its birth.

Many spiritual herbs would possess spirituality when born, granting them powerful strength. If they felt threatened, they would immediately escape or disappear into the ground. Once it disappears, it would be troublesome to find it again.

At the center of the array was a blood pool. There were eight people seated around the blood pool, and they were experts from the various big sects planning to compete among themselves once the Dragon Blood Fruit appears. They were all enveloped in terrifying martial intent and shining bright light that made everyone feel suffocating.

Around the eight of them were piles of corpses. Lin Yun instantly knew that the blood pool at the center came from the corpses, and the blood was emitting a terrifying aura that proves that those who died were strong when they were alive. After all, the big sect’s disciples have killed anyone who dared to try and intrude here. So they used the blood of their victim as nourishment for the Dragon Blood Fruit.

But there was still someone alive and on his knees. He was in a terrible state with0 eight experts looking at him with disdain.

“Zhao Yan, no need to struggle any longer. Kneel there and watch how we will take the Dragon Blood Fruit away.”

“The Zhao Clan can be considered a powerful Saint Clan, but it’s nothing compared to our sects. But don’t worry, we won’t kill you since you have a great saint in your clan.” The big sect’s disciples mocked. After all, Zhao Yan was the descendant of a Saint Clan and wasn’t just any random person. This made them feel accomplished after making Zhao Yan kneel before them.

“You bastards! Do you guys dare to fight me one-on-one?!” Zhao Yan raged.

“Tsk, tsk. There’s no meaning in fighting one-on-one. After all, the reason why we joined hands together was to suppress so-called ‘geniuses’ like you.” Someone mocked with a playful gaze.

Right at that moment, Lin Yun stepped into the array and appeared before the eight of them. A man donned in silver clothes looked at Lin Yun from above. “Another one here to die?”

“Mhm?” A black-clothed youth’s eyes lit up upon seeing Lin Yun and smiled. “This person isn’t simple. His vitality is strong, he must’ve cultivated an ancient body-refining technique. Tsk, tsk. I bet the Dragon Blood Fruit will love his blood.”

“Haha, he’s the best nourishment possible. With him, the Dragon Blood Fruit might even become a saint elixir!” A robust man looked at Lin Yun with excitement.

Lin Yun was puzzled when he heard that. It looked like these people had been waiting for victims to come by themselves before using them as nourishment for the Dragon Blood Fruit.

“Lin Yun, leave quickly! They’ve set up the Nine Dragon Devouring Array to delay the birth of the Dragon Blood Fruit so that they can lure geniuses over and use their corpses to enhance the Dragon Blood Fruit into a saint elixir!” Zhao Yan exclaimed after a brief stun when he saw Lin Yun.

The Nine Dragon Devouring Array? Lin Yun was surprised and could sense a terrifying spiritual rune fluctuation within the surroundings. Occasionally, the wind that blew over would even make him feel a chill down his spine.

“It’s too late even if you’ve already discovered it.” Gongsun Yan, who was following Lin Yun, sighed. After all, he had already warned Lin Yun before, but Lin Yun didn’t heed his words. Quasi-saint elixirs weren’t things that just anyone could obtain.

Furthermore, Gongsun Yan was determined to see how Lin Yun would die, but he also wanted to see how things would unfold. In his eyes, Lin Yun would definitely be dead. After all, Zhao Yan had a great saint in his clan, so none of these geniuses from the big sects would dare to kill him. But it was different for Lin Yun, who didn’t have any background. They would definitely turn Lin Yun into nourishment for the Dragon Blood Fruit.

This made Gongsun Yan sneer, but he didn’t dare to make a move, fearing that he might be discovered.

“It’s already too late for you, even if you wanted to escape now.” A woman donned in golden armor coldly looked at Lin Yun.

“Stand up and speak.” Lin Yun raised his brow before he turned into a streak of light and shot toward Zhao Yan. Gongsun Yan and Zhao Yan weren’t the same. Lin Yun had a good impression of Zhao Yan, so there was no way he could just stand and watch Zhao Yan being humiliated.

“Such impudence.” The woman’s eyes flashed with a cold light as she raised her right hand. In the next second, golden halos began to appear behind her arm. When she flicked her finger, rings of golden light condensed into a sword ray that shot toward Lin Yun. She wanted to heavily injure Lin Yun with this attack, and her attack was also terrifying, piercing through space and lighting up half the sky.

But Lin Yun merely glanced at the woman before he ignored her attack and continued toward Zhao Yan. When the sword ray landed on his body, it only caused a huge collision before it was consumed by draconic roars. As purple-golden dragon runes began to appear on the surface of his body, he relied on his physique alone to resist this attack.

“Get up!” Lin Yun waved his hand, instantly resolving the pressure on Zhao Yan. This made Zhao Yan let out a breath of relief before he was helped to his feet by Lin Yun.

Meanwhile, the eight geniuses were shocked by Lin Yun’s physique. This made the woman furious and wanted to launch another attack. But right at that moment, a black-clothed fatty with a height of three meters suddenly smiled. “Wait. Friend, is that the Azure Dragon Saint Physique?”

He had a huge body and his violent aura didn’t look human. Just sitting there alone, he was emitting a great pressure with his vitality violently roaring. This meant that he was also an expert in the body-refining technique.

“Good eyesight,” replied Lin Yun. He didn’t deny it, since the Azure Dragon Saint Art had huge fame, so it wasn’t surprising that it would be recognized by others.

“Hehe. That’s one of the ten body-refining techniques from ancient times. Most of what we can find is incomplete. Yours should also be incomplete, right? At least it won’t be safe after reaching the Elysium Core Realm, am I right?” The fatty smiled with his cheeks trembling.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word and wanted to see what the fatty was trying to say. His Azure Dragon Saint Art wasn’t only complete, the Azure Dragon Lord even bestowed him an Azure Dragon True Bone. If anyone could reach a high level in this body-refining technique, it would only be him.

“How about this, join my Myriad Beast Gate. My Myriad Beast Gate has elders who have reached the Saint Realm with just their physique. As long as you hand over the body-refining technique, I believe those elders will be willing to perfect it. At least, it’s better than leaving it incomplete in your hands,” said the fatty.

“Lin Yun, don’t believe him. Even if the Azure Dragon Saint Art isn’t complete, the value is a lot higher than a quasi-saint elixir. Many people in the Myriad Beast Gate have the bloodline of demonic beasts, and they’re not friendly with human cultivators. So, don’t believe him.” Zhao Yan transmitted his voice to Lin Yun, fearing that Lin Yun would be fooled by the fatty. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Lin Yun didn’t have any change on his face, then smiled. “Didn’t you guys hold enmity against me earlier? You wanted to use my corpse as nourishment for the Dragon Blood Fruit.”

“Haha, it’s just a misunderstanding. If you join the Myriad Beast Gate, no one will dare to touch you!” The fatty smiled and his words were filled with dominance. His words made the other seven geniuses unhappily glare at him, but none of them said a single thing.

“There are many geniuses in the world, so we just have to continue to suppress the Dragon Blood Fruit. There will be an endless supply of geniuses who think that they’re strong enough to compete for the fruit. So we just have to wait for them to come themselves,” smiled the fatty.

“Oh?” Lin Yun smiled with his eyes flickering.

“What’s the matter, you doubt our strength?” The fatty snickered. “Look at this pile of corpses before you. Which of them aren’t geniuses? But they’re nothing before us. There’s also someone who claimed to be from the Sword Emperor lineage earlier, claiming that he’ll sweep through us. But after a hundred moves, he could only beg us for mercy and fled with his tail between his legs.

“I believe his name is Gongsun Yan? He’s arrogant and even advised us to be merciful or he’ll use us as nourishments for the Dragon Blood Fruit. He’s just a fool.”

The other seven geniuses laughed with mockery on their faces as they looked at Lin Yun with warning gazes.

Hearing that, Gongsun Yan, who was hiding outside, nearly threw up a mouthful of blood. He crept over, wanting to see how Lin Yun would be humiliated. But the outcome was these people using him as an example to intimidate Lin Yun, instead.
