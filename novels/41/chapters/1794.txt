Chapter 1795 - Strongest Battle On The Dragon Pulse Ranking

Lin Yun rose to mid-air, and the seven dragon pulses behind him covered the sky. This instantly made Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and the Autumn Mountain Lord feel great pressure.

After all, those dragon pulses were close to ten thousand feet!

To be exact, they were nine thousand feet and close to ten thousand. So there wasn’t much difference in the eyes of those three. The size of Lin Yun’s dragon pulses had far exceeded their comprehension.

It was still understandable that the two God Generals could possess dragon pulses that were six thousand feet because of the Nethermoon Saint Armor, but how could Lin Xiao’s ridiculous dragon pulses be explained? Was this Lin Xiao’s confidence?

Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and the Autumn Mountain Lord could feel their scalps go numb with disbelief filling their pupils. But before they could continue to ponder, Lin Yun already dashed over like a lightning bolt.

He fought three enemies alone, and the pressure he gave off was so overwhelming that it made them feel suffocating. Fine cracks began to appear on the aura formed by the dragon pulses as if the aura they formed would explode at any moment. At that time, it would be troublesome for them.

With the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent and ten thousand-foot wide dragon pulses, Lin Yun instantly erased the advantages of Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and the Autumn Mountain Lord. But those three were ultimately at the top three of the Dragon Pulse Ranking, and none of them were pushovers.

In terms of their attainment in marital dao alone, they were stronger than either of the two God Generals. They quickly adjusted their mental states and exchanged a glance before the Autumn Mountain Lord charged over.

No one could imagine how terrifying Lin Yun’s dragon pulses close to ten thousand feet were. So the Autumn Mountain Lord had to step forth no matter what at this moment. This was because he had the strongest physique amongst the three. Even if the Autumn Mountain Lord couldn’t face Lin Yun head-on, at least he wouldn’t immediately suffer heavy injuries. After all, both Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi had a weaker physique than him.

When Lin Yun and the Autumn Mountain Lord exchanged blows, they struck each other’s chests. Their exchange created a powerful storm of dragon origin that swept out. This made the audience members hold their breath while nervously looking at the two.

A crisp sound echoed that sounded like a glacier breaking, and the Autumn Mountain Lord was blown ten meters away by this palm. When the Autumn Mountain Lord landed on the ground, his foot was firmly planted on the ground like a mountain, and this created two-inch deep footprints on the ground.

The dragon origin around him shattered, with blood dripping down from his lips. He had lost the match in the exchange, but the Autumn Mountain Lord wore a smile. Although he retreated by ten meters, he didn’t suffer any serious injuries. This meant that dragon pulses that were ten thousand meters wide were strong, but they weren’t invincible.

“I’m sorry to disappoint you, but ten thousand-foot wide dragon pulses aren’t impressive at all.” The Autumn Mountain Lord wiped the blood off his lip and grinned. When a ripple fluctuated, his body shot out like an arrow.

In his path, the air was torn apart, blowing the Autumn Mountain Lord’s hair backward. In the next moment, he appeared before Lin Yun once more.

“Imperial Overlord Physique—Golden Dragon Saint Armor!” The Autumn Mountain Lord let out a roar with a dazzling golden radiance shining from his body. A layer of golden dragon scales appeared on the surface of his body, and this made his Imperial Overlord Physique even more powerful.

When the two clashed in mid-air, Lin Yun was knocked back by a punch after ten-odd moves. On the other hand, the Autumn Mountain Lord gasped for his breath in mid-air with sweat covering his forehead. Anyone could tell that clashing with Lin Yun head-on wasn’t easy for him. He started forming seals in mid-air, and his dragon aura began to accumulate.

As soon as Lin Yun landed on the ground, Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi dashed over. They naturally wouldn’t give up this opportunity that the Autumn Mountain Lord created for them.

On the stage, Lin Yun kept retreating as he faced Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi’s attacks. Right then, the Autumn Mountain Lord dashed over while Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi retreated. Lin Yun had an opening, and the Autumn Mountain Lord didn’t hesitate to unleash the dragon seal that had been accumulating.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he knew from his Sword Heart’s warning that he couldn’t avoid this attack in time. Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi had held him down, thus creating the perfect opportunity for Autumn Mountain Lord.

Taking the strike head-on, Lin Yun was sent flying a hundred meters away, and he even took three steps back after landing on the ground before he regained his foothold.

Confronting three experts was taxing to Lin Yun, even with the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. Half of the hundred thousand dragon runes were shattered, and the Blue Dragon Bone couldn’t replenish the dragon runes in time.

“Let’s go!” Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and Autumn Mountain Lord dashed forth. They knew this was the opportunity for them before Lin Yun could catch his breath.

After Lin Yun stabilized his footing, his hair fluttered in the wind, and his thumb pressed down on his middle finger. The sword scabbard that was plunged onto the stage trembled. When Lin Yun yanked his right hand backward, the Flower Burial Sword flew out, emitting a reverberating sword vibration. The sword had the momentum of a dragon, flying towards the three like a lightning bolt.

This instantly made Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and Autumn Mountain Lord’s faces change with a chill running down their spines. They could feel an extremely dangerous aura, so they quickly stopped charging forth to dodge instead.

Standing where he was, Lin Yun waved his hand and the Flower Burial Sword charged forth again. The dragon pulses around him roared, and the Flower Burial Sword danced, forcing Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and Autumn Mountain Lord to keep retreating.

For a moment, the Flower Burial Sword was like a bolt of lightning as it unleashed countless sword rays under Lin Yun’s control. Ji Lingfeng was forced to draw his blade and a phoenix tree rose from the ground behind him. Xiao Yuanqi panicked a little because none of his three martial intents could block Lin Yun’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. Only the Autumn Mountain Lord was the calmest of the three. He was calm and composed.

When the sword collided with his dragon scales, sparks flew around and dragon scales fell. But the Autumn Mountain Lord was calm, and he only had to defend his vitals.

All the spectators were dumbfounded and their breaths were taken by the battle because it was too exciting. Their previous act of probing Lin Yun was exciting enough. But after they brought out their full strength, everyone was so shocked that they were speechless.

Their eyes were glued on the battle, and such a battle was rare, even in a century. No one wanted to miss out on any details, and they would definitely be able to gain something from this battle.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

But they were so immersed in the fight they didn’t notice that as the battle ensued on the stage, thunderclouds began to gather over Thunder Island. They were slow, like how it was the calm before the storm, and no one could imagine how terrifying it would be.

Just when everyone was shocked by the power of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent and how Lin Yun turned the tables around the moment he drew his sword, the Autumn Mountain Lord finally made his move. His right hand bolted through the sword rays and grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword’s sword tip with great precision.

This made the Flower Burial Sword start to tremble, and he had to bear all the sword aura on the sword by himself. As a powerful shockwave swept out, it felt as though the Autumn Mountain Lord wasn’t grabbing onto a sword but a dragon.

“Quick! Attack him!” The Autumn Mountain Lord roared as he became enveloped in a golden radiance.

Exclamations resounded from the surrounding area, while Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi heaved out a breath of relief. They didn’t hesitate to dash towards Lin Yun, and the situation suddenly became unfavorable to Lin Yun once more.

Lin Yun’s expression was calm and composed as his right hand formed a seal before his chest. His gaze was on the Flower Burial Sword, and his sword ocean within his brows suddenly began to boil.

As boundless sword intent gathered on the Flower Burial Sword, the Autumn Mountain Lord could only hold on with great difficulty as the golden radiance erupted from his body. He wore a grimacing face, and his physique was like an immovable mountain.

Under this stalemate, Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi quickly approached while Lin Yun’s sword aura was practically all on his sword.

“It’s over now!” Everyone’s hearts sank, but Lin Yun couldn’t be distracted now. As long as the Autumn Mountain Lord could last till they get close to Lin Yun, they would be able to turn the tables around. So everyone’s nerves were tense while watching this battle.

Right then, Lin Yun pushed his right hand forth. The seven ten thousand-foot wide dragon pulses began to rumble, and a massive aura descended onto the Flower Burial Sword. When all of the Autumn Mountain Lord’s dragon scales were peeled off by the Flower Burial Sword like snowflakes, he threw out a mouthful of blood and took three steps back.

This time, the ground violently trembled when he moved. It was as though he was an actual mountain.

“Come back!” Lin Yun waved his hand, and grabbed onto the hilt of his sword. Dazzling sword rays shone out from him, and he easily used the Flower Burial Sword to receive Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi’s attacks. When he moved, the Azure Dragon Sword Art was perfectly executed.

Even when Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi joined hands, they could still feel a great pressure coming from Lin Yun. Ten-odd moves later, Lin Yun swung his sword, executing the Azure Dragon Sword Art—Azure Dragon Tail.

As he unleashed the sword ray, cracks appeared in the sky and a sword mark appeared on Xiao Yuanqi’s chest with blood gushing out.

“Wingspread Phoenix!” Ji Lingfeng blocked the attack with his blade. There was a phoenix behind him with a powerful radiance shining from his pupils. His attack was strong, and his attack continued to head towards Lin Yun after shattering the sword ray.

When Lin Yun let go, he slammed his palm on the sword hilt. The space was like a passage as the Flower Burial Sword streaked across the sky like a light beam towards the Autumn Mountain Lord.

Just when the Autumn Mountain Lord stabilized his foothold, his face changed as the sword fell onto his chest. This made the Autumn Mountain Lord throw out another mouthful of blood. The sword was pressed against the dragon scales on his chest, pushing him backward.

“A great opportunity!” Ji Lingfeng rejoiced because Lin Yun didn’t have his sword now, and a blade was enough to inflict severe injuries on the latter. After reaching their level, it would be hard for their opponent to continue fighting the moment they found an opening.

But what happened next shocked Ji Lingfeng because Lin Yun reached out with his hand, grabbing a sword.

Even if Lin Yun had poured his dragon runes into his hand, he still couldn’t completely block Ji Lingfeng’s attack, and blood dripped down his palm. This made Ji Lingfeng take a deep breath because they never expected Lin Yun to be so ruthless to himself.

“Heavenly Demonic Cauldron Seal!” A roar echoed from mid-air, and Xiao Yuanqi flew over with his right hand grabbing onto something. When he got close to Lin Yun, the three martial intents condensed into an ancient cauldron, and he used it to slam against Lin Yun.
