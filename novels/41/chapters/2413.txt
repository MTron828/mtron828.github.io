Chapter 2414 - Subduing the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron

“Big Brother Lin, time to get up!”

Lin Yun opened his eyes after an exhausting night. The first thing he saw was the energetic Yue Weiwei, and she was already wearing her clothes. When the sunlight shone on her, it made Yue Weiwei even more bewitching as she gently helped Lin Yun put on his clothes.

When Lin Yun tried moving his body, he immediately felt an aching pain, especially around his waist. He was even more exhausted than during his fight at the Heavenly Barren Banquet yesterday. Last night was too much.

“Hehe. Big Brother Lin, you’ve recovered so quickly?” Yue Weiwei adjusted Lin Yun’s clothes and looked at him.

When Lin Yun lowered his head, he was soon captivated by Yue Weiwei’s beauty and had to admit that she was a demoness.

Lin Yun bitterly misled, “Why does that sound weird when you ask it?”

“Big Brother Lin, I’m praising you. There’s nothing weird about it,” Yue Weiwei said, pampering him.

Lin Yun soon couldn’t hold himself back and held Yue Weiwei by her waist. Yue Weiwei immediately felt Lin Yun’s reaction and a blush rose on her face. She bashfully said with a hint of a cunning light flashing in her eyes, “No can do. Big Brother Lin, it’s already daytime.”

At the same time, Yue Weiwei gently swiped her fingers across Lin Yun’s skin, which made Lin Yun react. With no other choice, Lin Yun could only draw his sword and fight with Yue Weiwei again.

As they clashed, Lin Yun held the initiative at the start. In the end, Lin Yun even had to circulate the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique to strengthen his sword and vitality, but he barely obtained a victory in the end.

“Big Brother Lin, why don’t you leave behind a name for our child?” Yue Weiwei looked at Lin Yun.

“You will carry my child for certain?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“For sure,” Yue Weiwei smiled. “So you have to live well.”

“Lin Jue if it’s a boy, and Lin Xin if it’s a girl,” Lin Yun said.

“Is there any deeper meaning behind it?”

“Consider it a hope.”

It didn’t take long before Ji Zixi arrived and they went to Heaven’s Gate Ancestral Palace together. After they briefly chatted, Lin Yun saw them off at noon. They could only meet again when Lin Yun reforges the Heavenly Path in the future.

Lin Yun returned to the city and saw Lin Jiangxian, who had been waiting for a long time.

“Where’s Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue? Have they already left?” Lin Yun asked.

Lin Jiangxian said, “Do you still remember that white-clothed youth? The two of them have been together with Feng Qingyu lately, visiting the Heaven’s Gate Wine Cellar daily. They’re bold, planning to steal some Demigod Wine.”

Lin Yun was stumped, but soon recalled that white-clothed youth. He smiled, “The Demigod Wine is a good wine, but the ancestral deity isn’t easy to interact with. He’s frightening when he’s furious.”

Even Lin Yun felt that the airs given off by the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity were terrifying and that even someone like the Heavenly Seal Emperor had to be careful with him.

“How was it?” Lin Jiangxian asked.

Lin Yun sighed and shared with Lin Jiangxian about his experience with the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity.

Lin Jiangxian held onto her chin, before she said, “The ancestral deity is pretty good to you to conduct a Heavenly Dao Baptism on you. The heavenly dao energy he used isn’t any less than what he could have used to send you back to the Kunlun Realm. It looks like he can’t because of the rules set up by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity, not that he isn’t willing to exhaust his heavenly dao energy.”

Lin Yun nodded, sharing the same thoughts. Even Ye Wuhen wouldn’t receive a Heavenly Dao Baptism without taking the ancestral deity as his master. The ancestral deity didn’t just push his cultivation to a ninth-stage Saint Lord but reforged his foundation. Now, his foundation wasn’t any weaker than those deities’ descendants.

“Are you sure that you want to return to the Kunlun Realm?” Lin Jiangxian asked. She wanted to verify it one last time, despite knowing Lin Yun’s answer. After all, the Kunlun Realm was dangerous, not to mention reforging the Heavenly Path. Just his master’s tribulation alone would be troublesome.

Lin Yun might be invincible amongst those of the same generation, but his opponents in the Kunlun Realm were Saint Sovereigns, Great Saints, and even Emperors. But if he took the ancestral deity as his master, no one from the older generation would dare to make a move against him.

Lin Yun nodded. He had to return, no matter what.

“Okay, I’ll help you,” Lin Jiangxian said.

“As expected of someone who shares the same surname as me,” Lin Yun smiled. Ever since coming to the three thousand realms, the biggest harvest he had was becoming acquainted with Lin Jiangxian, aside from re-encountering Yue Weiwei.

“A swordsman should help another swordsman,” Lin Jiangxian was straightforward. She continued, “I have already told my master about the situation, and he must’ve made arrangements. That friend of my master has also agreed.”

“It shouldn’t be easy to send me back to the Kunlun Realm. What’s the relationship between your master and that person?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“They’re someone my master can trust his life with,” Lin JIangxian said. “I know what you’re worried about, and I have a complicated relationship with my master. I have never asked anything from him since I was young, but he will help out since I asked.”

Lin Yun nodded and said nothing. He knew Lin Jiangxian’s personality, and she wouldn’t give her promise if she wasn’t confident in keeping it.

“Let’s go.”

“Where are we going?”

“To take a look at my treasure.” Lin Yun smiled mysteriously before returning to the Heavenly Saint Courtyard with Lin Jiangxian.

Lin Jiangxian then saw the treasure that Lin Yun spoke of, the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. She asked in shock, “The ancestral deity gave it to you?”

Lin Yun nodded with a smile.

“This isn’t simple...” Lin Jiangxian was stumped. “According to what you've said, that ancestral deity isn’t easy to interact with, and the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron has been the treasure of Heaven’s Gate for many years for their disciples to comprehend. It’s even more important than other Sovereign Saint Artifacts, and can be comparable to a Divine Artifact!”

“He has already helped me with everything that he could. If I can’t reforge the Heavenly Path, I will have no excuse,” Lin Yun said. In Lin Yun’s view, the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity hoped that the Heavenly Path could be reforged, despite not saying anything about it. This proved that he had a good relationship with the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity.

“Can you take it away now?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“I can’t. But the ancestral deity said that as long as I become a Saint Sovereign, I can use the Blue Dragon Divine Seal to summon it to the Kunlun Realm. But I must be a Great Saint in order to control it entirely. I will leave my imprint behind, so wait for me here.” Lin Yun soared to the sky and landed on the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron.

Although he had left his imprint behind before, it wasn’t complete, since he had to watch out for Profound Sky Venerable. But now that he had received the ancestral deity’s words, he didn’t have to have any reason to hide it.

When Lin Yun examined the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, Profound Sky Venerable arrived. Lin Yun smiled, “I was just looking for you, and you came.”

Profound Sky Venerable furiously said, “I knew that you had long put your eyes on the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron.”

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled and said nothing.

“Alright, I got it. I’m under the ancestral deity’s orders to protect you and teach you how to subdue this cauldron,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled. He was rather fond of Lin Yun, and he was happy to see whether Lin Yun could subdue the cauldron.

“Thank you,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Wait a moment. Let me remove the other imprints and seals that are from Heaven’s Gate.” There were many imprints on the cauldron. Aside from the ancestral deity, the thirty-six venerables and Heavenly Seal Emperor could also control the cauldron. The process didn’t last long, and they were swiftly removed. Profound Sky Emperor said, “Okay, you can release your blood now.”

Lin Yun cut his palm and poured his Dragon’s Blood into the cauldron. When he exhausted most of his blood, Profound Sky Venerable stopped him.

“That’s still not enough. You will have to refine it again after becoming an Emperor. You can barely use it now, and you can imprint the seal taught to you by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity,” the Profound Sky Venerable said.

Lin Yun nodded and began to fuse the Blue Dragon Divine Seal with his blood. This time, his connection with the cauldron increased, and his consciousness sank into the massive and maze-like construct within the cauldron. He could see various divine runes intertwining and a Blue Dragon’s soul at the depths of it. That dragon’s soul was in a deep sleep, but Lin Yun did not dare to alarm it. He only looked at it from afar before leaving.

He finally felt relieved since this cauldron was his most significant reliance for the success of his master’s tribulation if everything went smoothly.

“This is a treasure from the Kunlun Realm, to begin with. I believe it will shine brightly if it returns to the Kunlun Realm.” Profound Sky Venerable said, “Back then, the Blue Dragon King spent a lot of effort refining it, and I can tell that this cauldron has been waiting for you.”

“I saw a dragon inside,” Lin Yun said.

“That’s a pure-blooded dragon soul. It was one of the divine beast guardians of the Kunlun Realm, and the Blue Dragon King left it in the cauldron when it died,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

Lin Yun looked at the cauldron for a long time.

It didn’t take long before Feng Bumao, Xia Qingyun, and Ye Wuhen arrived. They were here to bid farewell to Lin Yun. Feng Bumao disappointedly said, “I’m surprised you refused the ancestral deity.”

“The news has already spread out?” Lin Yun smiled.

Xia Qingyun said, “How can it not spread out? After all, you’re the only person who refused the ancestral deity so far, and this is even more shocking than how you suppressed Feng Yuan.”

“Rejecting the ancestral deity means refusing the protection of Heaven’s Gate. You must be careful once you leave the city,” Ye Wuhen said. He was the future of Heaven's Gate, but Lin Yun’s strength subdued him.

“It’s not that serious. I can send you to where you’re going. I believe the Heavenly Seal Emperor won’t stand and watch if you run into any trouble. After all, you’ve greatly helped Heaven’s Gate,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled.

“Great!” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up. He knows Heaven’s Gate couldn’t openly protect him after rejecting to become the ancestral deity’s disciple. But it wasn’t a problem for an Emperor to protect him in the dark. After bidding their farewells, he left with Lin Jiangxian under Profound Sky Venerable’s protection in the dark.

“Do you know the origin of that friend of your master that grasped both Time and Space Daos?” Lin Yun asked.

“I only met him a few times. According to my master, even Ancestral Stage experts don’t dare to look down on that friend of his,” Lin Jiangxian said.

Even Ancestral Stage experts don’t dare to look down on him? Lin Yun was stumped upon hearing that.
