Chapter 740 - Fireflies

Everyone poured their origin energy into their pupils. With their cultivation, they could see countless demonic beasts in a clear formation. The Profound Martial Realm demonic beasts were at the very front, the Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts were in the center, and the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts were at the very back.

Under the infection of the ominous aura, the demonic beasts appeared even more bloodthirsty than normal. The old man spoke solemnly, “Those in the Yin stage and Yang stage form groups of four. Those in the Yin-Yang stage form groups of two. I’ll take the head of the city wall.”

No one here was a soldier, so it was impossible to lay down an array. So the old man could only resort to this manner as everyone began to disperse.

“Young friend, I’ll join you.” A middle-aged swordsman smiled as he landed beside Lin Yun. His cultivation was at the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage. He was roughly in his forties as the aura he emitted was even stronger than Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu.

Lin Yun could protect himself alone, so it was interesting that this man came to find him. Lin Yun merely nodded his head in response.

“Young friend, your surname is Lin, right? My name is Long Hao.” The middle-aged man seemed to be interested in Lin Yun, but their chat came to an end as the demonic beasts charged over.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word as he drew the Flower Burial Sword and jumped off the city wall. The ground cracked when he landed on the ground as he began slaughtering the demonic beasts coming at him.

“What powerful sword intent.” Long Hao frowned his brows with surprise in his pupils. He could sense that Lin Yun didn’t use much origin energy in his attacks. He had only used his sword intent.

“Interesting…” The interest in Long Hao’s eyes grew even denser. He thought that Lin Yun would need his help, but Lin Yun’s strength had exceeded his imagination.

In the blink of an eye, all the Profound Martial Realm demonic beasts were completely slaughtered. Then, the Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts charged over.

Lin Yun swung his sword and blood splattered from a demonic beast. But he was surprised because the demonic beast wasn’t dead. “You aren’t dead?”

The Yin-Yang stage demonic beast roared out in pain as it shot out a green water geyser from its mouth. The water had a corrosive attribute, but Lin Yun faced it by stabbing his sword out. The water geyer was split into two and the demonic beast was crushed.

“This lad is interesting.” Long Hao was surprised before he smiled, “With him here, it’ll be easier for me.”

“Charge! Don’t give them time to regroup!” The old man roared.

With that, Lin Yun and the Yin-Yang stage experts charged over without any hesitation.

“Luminous Moon! Heavenly Cloud Shatter! Myriad Frost!” Lin Yun executed the three ultimate moves of the Aquaselenic Sword. Luminous Moon was initially only a sword ray, but now, it had evolved to hundreds of sword rays intertwined together. As for Heavenly Cloud Shatter, it was even more powerful as a hundred feet tornado swept out, killing all the demonic beasts in its path.

“This fellow is a little too powerful…” Feng Ye’s lips twitched at this scene. Unlike the others, he had witnessed the Aquaselenic Sword’s might back in the Dragon Gate Competition. Back then, the power still wasn’t so excessive.

“Not surprising. After all, he wants to compete with those geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking.” Zuo Yun, on the other hand, was calmer than Feng Ye. He was in the pinnacle Yang stage. He might not be as strong as Lin Yun, but he wasn’t inferior to the geniuses on the outer ranking.

“This youth is a little too powerful.”

“Even many swordsmen in Swordmire City aren’t as strong as him.”

“It’s hard to tell. After all, Swordmire City is a city of swordsmen.” Lin Yun’s performance had attracted many people’s attention, but there was no change on Lin Yun’s face.

Lin Yun understood the beast tide better than others and he had his own rhythm. Lin Yun was also comprehending his sword path while he slaughtered, sorting out his techniques and constantly staying true to his heart.

It was already formidable for geniuses to comprehend the xiantian sword intent or other martial intents at such a young age. But not many could bring their sword intent to greater mastery. As for complete mastery, there were only two or three in the entire Ancient Southern Domain who accomplished this at such a young age. Lin Yun was one of them.

As for spiritual sword intent, there wasn’t a single person who reached it. It was rare even among senior swordsmen. There might be some, but they were practically legends. After all, the cultivation and comprehension of sword intent wasn’t easy. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

But Lin Yun was determined to achieve it. If spiritual sword intent was a legend, then he would mark it with his name and shine brightly on the Draconic Banquet.

“Damn it, it’s a Thunderock Tiger!” A greater Yin-Yang stage demonic beast suddenly charged over while Feng Ye and Zuo Yun were fighting several Yin-Yang stage demonic beasts.

But once the Thunderock Tiger jumped over, an Iris Flower bloomed and a silver sword ray streaked through the horizon, piercing through the Thunderock Tiger’s head and claiming its life. Furthermore, the sword ray continued and cleared half of the demonic beasts surrounding the two.

“It’s the Flicking Divine Finger…” Feng Ye was speechless. He had witnessed how powerful the Flicking Divine Finger was in the past, but it had become unimaginably powerful now.

Compared to him, Zuo Yun was calmer as he unleashed a terrifying saber intent, stopping demonic beasts from getting past him. He then slaughtered the remaining demonic beasts. When Zuo Yun sheathed his sword, he smiled at Lin Yun’s direction, to which Lin Yun responded with a smile as well.

Very quickly, all the demonic beasts within his sight were slaughtered as he came to a stop. He didn’t go deeper into the beast tide. After all, they were mainly protecting the city, so it would be terrible if he couldn’t make it back after going too deep into the beast tide.

Stabbing the Flower Burial Sword into a demonic beast’s corpse, Lin Yun sat down and closed his eyes to circulate the Iris Sword Sutra as an Iris Flower bloomed beneath him, basking him in silver radiance.

“What courage to recover his origin energy here.”

“His guts are unparalleled.” Everyone was shocked to see Lin Yun seated among the pile of corpses to recover his origin energy. But no one said anything because Lin Yun had already killed all the demonic beasts on his side.

When Long Hao saw this scene, he also smiled before his smile froze. As a swordsman, he had more origin energy than Lin Yun and he could also see something the others couldn’t, “That’s…”

In his eyes, the entire world was enveloped with darkness and only Lin Yun and his sword were glowing. The silver glow Lin Yun and his sword were giving off was equivalent to flames illuminating the darkness. But that wasn’t all as he could see a spiritual aura enveloping Lin Yun.

Lin Yun wasn’t just recovering his origin energy, but he was also comprehending the martial path. As the Iris Flower bloomed on the ground, Long Hao could clearly see fireflies that looked like mysterious runes.

He knew that those fireflies were part of Lin Yun’s sword intent. However, no matter how he looked at them, it seemed like they were coming to life as they surrounded Lin Yun.

Suddenly, a terrifying aura exploded out at the north side of the city, accompanied by ferocious roars as dozens of Violet Palace Realm experts in that direction had died. This made everyone’s face change as they saw a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast. This demonic beast actually concealed its aura and caught the Violet Palace Realm experts by surprise.

Everyone knew that no one could have survived the attack at the north gate. If the gate was truly broken, then everyone would be slaughtered.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun opened his eyes as he sensed a gaze on him. More accurately, the old man was looking at Lin Yun and Long Hao. The old man was busy and couldn’t handle the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast, so he passed the responsibility over to Lin Yun and Long Hao.

Lin Yun was straightforward, so he drew his sword and headed towards the north gate. Long Hao followed him with a smile.
