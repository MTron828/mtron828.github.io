Chapter 2153 - Ruthless

“He really has the Heavenly Dragon’s blood?”

“That means the myth about the Heavenly Dragon Lord is true… I’m afraid that there will be a reshuffle in the Blue Dragon Record now…”

“There will be chaos now. All those who failed to become the champion of a dragon mountain will have a second chance.”

“It’s hard to say. The Saint Elder might not agree to it.”

“I’m afraid that she won’t have a choice. All the holy lands will be tempted as well.” The moment the Dragonbat Great Saint finished, there was an uproar outside the dragon mountains. Even the champions of the various dragon mountains had a great fluctuation in their emotions. They were concerned if they could compete for it if there was really a Heavenly Dragon Lord.

“So the Heavenly Dragon Lord really exists." Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that from the Dragon’s Claw of the Azure Dragon Path.

Everyone’s gazes were focused on Mu Xueling, including Zi Ling. The Divine Dragon Empire had no control over the Blue Dragon Record. She was only responsible for helping Mu Xueling. So Mu Xueling had to make the final decision.

Zi Ling was worried now because if the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position fell into the hands of the Blood Moon Sect or the Demonspirit Clan, the Blue Dragon Record would become a laughingstock. Not only would it greatly affect the Divine Dragon Empire’s interests, it would strengthen their opponents instead, and this was something Zi Ling couldn’t accept. But just when she was feeling nervous, a voice resounded by her ears that made her briefly stunned before she ultimately nodded. She looked at Mu Xueling, and she said, “Saint Elder, you make the decision.”

Mu Xueling was surprised to hear that, before her face slightly changed. She was surprised by the possible appearance of the Heavenly Dragon’s blood, so she was placed in a difficult position.

“You really have the Heavenly Dragon’s blood?” Mu Xueling wanted to confirm it again.

The Dragonbat Great Saint smiled, “Why would I be here if I didn’t have it? Don’t belittle the foundation of the divine cult. According to the rules left behind by that lord, you cannot reject me. Are you trying to violate the rules set by the ancestors or has the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain fallen so far as to become the Divine Dragon Empire’s dog?”

The Dragonbat Great Saint had mockery on his face, and his words were unpleasant. He suddenly changed the topic, and laughed, “Or is everyone here that useless to fear the geniuses of my divine cult and the Spirit Clan? If that’s the case, don’t force yourself. You guys just have to bow to my divine cult! Hahaha!”

His words were filled with provocation. After all, the geniuses who came for the Blue Dragon Record were all arrogant geniuses, and they naturally couldn’t take the Dragonbat Great Saint’s provocation.

“Saint Elder, agree to it!”

“Why would we fear scum like them?”

“We won’t let the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position fall into their hands!” Shortly after, there was an overwhelming uproar. The Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position already made them tempted, not to mention the provocation from the Dragonbat Great Saint. As a result, everyone’s emotions exploded.

“We ask for the Saint Elder to open the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position!” Various forces placed Mu Xueling in a pinch. This time, not only the Dragonbat Great Saint, but the various holy lands also wanted to open up the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position.

This place Mu Xueling under great pressure. One was the ancestral rules, and the other were the voices from the surroundings. She couldn’t help turning to look at Lin Yun’s direction.

Lin Yun sensed this and raised his head as well, then they bumped gazes. This made Lin Yun realize that there were also times the Saint Elder would be placed in a tough spot. But before he could do anything, Mu Xueling shifted her gaze away.

“Give me the Heavenly Dragon’s blood, then. I’ll allow it,” Mu Xueling said, looking at the Dragonbat Great Saint.

“Good. I trust the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain’s reputation.” The Dragonbat Great Saint laughed. He wasn’t afraid that Mu Xueling would take the Heavenly Dragon’s blood for herself. He took out a jade bottle and threw it over to Mu Xueling under everyone’s gazes.

“That’s the Heavenly Dragon’s blood?”

“Where did it come from? Judging from the shock on that official’s face, even the Divine Dragon Empire might not have any Heavenly Dragon’s blood.”

“The Blood Moon Sect’s foundation is really terrifying.”

“It looks like the Heavenly Dragon’s blood is probably true.” The Saint Realm experts from the various holy lands became nervous. They were tempted by the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position, hoping that their holy sons could compete for it. Even if they couldn’t compete for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position, the appearance of it would reshuffle the Blue Dragon Record, and there would be an opportunity for everyone.

When Mu Xueling dropped the Heavenly Dragon’s blood on the Blue Dragon Record, the Blue Dragon Record began to shine brightly, accompanied by a Heavenly Dragon’s roar. When a dazzling dragon soared to the sky in the form of a pillar, it tore apart the thirty-six layers of heaven, creating multiple holes with countless starlight shining down from the sky.

“It’s real.” Mu Xueling muttered with disbelief. But she soon calmed herself down and soared to the sky, allowing the Blue Dragon Record to fly high above her.

Before everyone on the dragon mountains could come to their senses, the nine dragon mountains looked as if they were alive, letting out multiple dragon roars as they began to tangle and merge together.

Everyone on the dragon mountains felt that they lost control of their bodies and couldn’t move. The nine dragon mountains were merging into a mountain, one bigger than the nine dragon mountains. The newly appeared dragon mountain was over three thousand feet, looking like a massive pillar with nine dragon’s heads at the peak, looking like a blooming flower.

The nine dragon’s heads were a thousand meters apart, forming a massive circle. The nine dragon’s heads were looking at the center as though they were waiting for something.

The Blue Dragon Record that flew out soared to the dragon that broke through the thirty-six layers of heaven before forming into a dazzling beam of light that descended to the ground. The massive pressure instantly made everyone shocked, including the Saint Realm experts outside the dragon mountain.

This was the Heavenly Dragon’s pressure? Logically speaking, this shouldn't be the real Heavenly Dragon’s pressure since it was only a droplet of blood.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint raised his head and sighed, “So it’s true that the Heavenly Dragon transcends the seven divine dragons.”

He had a grave expression, unlike the other holy lands, who looked excited. After all, the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan weren’t pushovers, so they must’ve come prepared.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Thousand Plume Great Saint turned to look at the Dragonbat Great Saint along with Tian Gu and Gu Xinyu, who looked excited. Murderous intent flashed in his eyes as he began to wonder if the geniuses of the Kunlun Realm could stop those two. To be honest, he wasn’t very optimistic about it.

The geniuses from the other holy lands looked relaxed because Gu Xinyu and Tian Gu were only two people, no matter how strong they were. One was from the demonic cult, while the other was a member of the Demonspirit Clan. There was no need to be polite with them, so they could just gang up on those two.

Under everyone’s gazes, the Heavenly Dragon descended from the sky, landing at the center of the encirclement formed by the nine dragons, forming into a massive stage. When it was formed, everyone on the dragon mountain could finally look around.

When Lin Yun swept his gaze around, everyone was separated, aside from Bai Shuying, Ji Zixi, and Xin Yan, who were beside him. The nine dragon mountains have merged into one aside from the Dragon’s Head. Although the dragon mountain had become massive, the number of positions remained the same.

Raising his head, he saw that the nine thrones were still around on the Dragon’s Heads, and the people on them remained the same. Everyone was nervous because they were immobilized earlier, but they swiftly adjusted themselves after everything calmed down.

“Everyone can ascend the Heavenly Dragon Stage to compete to become the Heavenly Dragon Lord. The moment the Heavenly Dragon Lord is determined, that person will have to give up his previous spot. The Heavenly Dragon Lord will be ranked first on the Blue Dragon Record.” Just when everyone was curiously looking around, Mu Xueling’s voice resounded. After a brief silence, an uproar broke out while Gu Xiyan looked at the massive stage with his eyes flickering. No one could tell what he was thinking.

“To compete for the Heavenly Dragon Lord, I will have to give up on the Blue Dragon Lord’s title. But the moment I succeed, I will become the champion of the Blue Dragon Record. This means the competition on the nine thrones have disappeared, replaced by the Heavenly Dragon Lord. The only difference is that one can maintain their original spot if they fail, but if one fails on the Heavenly Dragon Stage, your position might be taken by someone else.” Gu Xiyan soon analyzed the competition. This was a tough choice to make. He could tell that the Heavenly Dragon Stage wasn’t simple.

He was close to it, and he could sense the Heavenly Dragon’s pressure that it was giving off. If one wanted to go up on the Heavenly Dragon Stage, they would have to bear the Heavenly Dragon’s pressure, and just this alone was risky. The moment a fight breaks out, the competition for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position would be a brutal one, and the loser might not have a path of retreat.

Then again, how many people could resist the temptation of the Heavenly Dragon Lord? Not only him, but everyone else on the other thrones were looking at the Heavenly Dragon Stage with fire blazing in their eyes. But they were smart and merely wore a smile. They weren't in a hurry to go on the Heavenly Dragon Stage.

The spots they had belonged to were considered seeded candidates, so they could make a decision anytime. So they weren’t in a hurry.

“Little Lin.” Just when Lin Yun was looking at the Heavenly Dragon Stage, a voice resounded beside his ears that made him tremble. This was Su Ziyao’s voice, and she was secretly transmitting her voice to him.

This made Lin Yun panic with a chill running down his spine. Didn’t she call him Big Brother Yun in the past? So why did she call him Little Lin now? When he looked outside the dragon mountain, he saw Su Ziyao donning a cloak, looking insignificant to the outside world.

If she didn’t take the initiative to reveal himself, Lin Yun wouldn’t have been able to find her. It was just as he had expected, Su Ziyao was here for a long time.

“Little Lin, I’ll write off what happened today if you can take up the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position,” Su Ziyao’s voice resounded once more.

Lin Yun bitterly smiled with his lips moving. He transmitted his voice back, “What if I failed to obtain it?”

“Your women will belong to me. I will take care of them for you, so you can give up on them.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched upon hearing that because Su Ziyao was really ruthless.
