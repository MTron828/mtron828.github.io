Chapter 1482 - Six Quotas

An Liuyan appeared less frequently after that, and Lin Yun could tell she was nervous about this trip whenever she appeared and spoke in somewhat apologetic tones.

But Lin Yun was patient with her because he wasn’t wasting any time. He was cultivating in An Liuyan’s cultivation chamber with the help of the incense. Most importantly, An Liuyan would give him tons of divine astral pellets whenever she came, along with various quasi-saint elixirs that even left Lin Yun breath taken by her wealth.

But considering that the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion was the largest chamber of commerce in the city, it wasn’t surprising that she could take out so many resources. Since Lin Yun was now broke, he naturally wouldn’t refuse her.

Since the black sword was born from the Nether Sword Seed, Lin Yun’s cultivation speed in the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra was much faster. He stabilized his cultivation at the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm in just seven days.

Upon a rough calculation, An Liuyan had given him close to three million divine astral pellets, which wasn’t inclusive of the quasi-saint elixirs. This huge improvement decreased the resentment Lin Yun had in his heart. Even if they couldn’t go to the astral realm, the time he spent the past few days was completely worthwhile.

Another seven days passed, and An Liuyan didn’t appear during this period. But she wouldn’t forget to have someone deliver divine astral pellets to him. When An Liuyan reappeared, she had surprise flashing through her pupils, “Young Master Lin hasn’t broken through the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm?”

She was, indeed, curious. With so many resources and the cultivation technique from the Sword Sect, it shouldn’t be an issue for Lin Yun to reach the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. It might sound exaggerated, but it wasn’t difficult for a monstrous genius. Most people couldn’t accomplish that because their talent and comprehension weren’t strong enough. But An Liuyan did not doubt Lin Yun’s talent and comprehension.

“Still a little lacking.” Lin Yun replied before he looked at An Liuyan, “Don’t tell me that you’re waiting for me to reach the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm?”

“This trip is of great significance to me. Not only you, but I’ve also given a lot of resources to several other people. I hope we all can become stronger before departing for the astral realm.” An Liuyan explained.

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised that An Liuyan would recruit more people for this trip since she looked swamped the past few days. He also reckoned that it was time to leave, and he had to know what An Liuyan was planning before leaving, “What’s the point? No need to keep it hidden from me now, right?”

Nodding her head, An Liuyan said, “The competition for the Young Lord of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion is intense and brutal. There used to be 108 envoys in the past, and only thirteen are left. This trip to the astral realm is a test prepared by the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. This time, eight people will be eliminated, and only five envoys will be left after that!”

Lin Yun fell into deep thought when he heard that. It turned out that An Liuyan planned on using him as a bodyguard or some sort.

“Don’t get me wrong, Young Master Lin. I didn’t expect this, and I’ve been hesitating if I should tell you about it.” An Liuyan gritted her teeth and hesitated. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Carry on.” Lin Yun said.

“According to the rules of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion, I can only bring six Elysium Core Realm experts with me.” An Liuyan replied.

“So you’re saying that I took a quota of yours?” Lin Yun asked with his brow raised.

An Liuyan didn’t say a word, which was the same as acknowledging what he said. Lin Yun’s face changed, and he didn't know why An Liuyan was different when they met this time, unlike their first time. Since she only had six quotas, every quota would be precious.

“What’s the highest cultivation among the six?” Lin Yun asked with his head raised.

“Eighth-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm!” An Liuyan looked at Lin Yun and continued, “Aside for you, the weakest is a six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. But this person is proficient in spiritual runes, and he’s no weaker than a seventh-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.”

“Understood.” Lin Yun’s expression became solemn as he realized that he had misunderstood An Liuyan. She said that this trip to the astral realm was significant to her, and he finally knew how significant it was to her.

“I can’t accept this quota. To be honest, I don’t know if I can win if I fight a sixth-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm expert now.” Lin Yun said. Then again, that was under the premise that he wouldn’t tap into his trump cards.

But An Liuyan bitterly smiled, “I’ll be honest with you. If I fail this time, I won’t be able to help you any longer in the future. According to the rules of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion, once an envoy is stripped of their qualification, they can only pick one remaining envoy and become a servant for life. But I have promised you a Divine Dragon Bone. So you can act on your own at that time, and you don’t have to get involved in the battles between envoys. Then again, you can also choose to back out of it.”

Her words made Lin Yun raise his brow, and he changed his opinion with An Liuyan. They had just met a few times, and she remembered what he had said. She was even willing to give him one quota, and this decisiveness was worth his respect.

“Can you wait one more day?” Lin Yun didn’t give a direct response and solemnly asked.

An Liuyan wore a difficult expression, but she ultimately agreed with a smile, “Alright!”

After An Liuyan, Lil’ Purple appeared from the sword box, and looked at Lin Yun, “I misunderstood her.”

“Let’s not talk about that. I have to try and make a breakthrough to the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.” Lin Yun said while he looked around.

“Ah? Where are you going to get so many resources?” Lil’ Purple asked. She knew Lin Yun’s foundation was too deep because he cultivated two sword sutras simultaneously along with the Azure Dragon Saint Art. This meant that the resources he needed to make a breakthrough were astronomical.

Suddenly, she thought of something and exclaimed, “The Profound Wither Key!”

The Profound Wither Key contained the inheritance left behind by the Profound Wither Great Saint. It had a total of nine seals, and he had only undone one. Every time he undid a seal, he could obtain a vast amount of pure condensed sun and moon essence.

“You have to think about it carefully. This is your biggest reliance, and you have a long path ahead of you. Do you have to waste it at the Elysium Core Realm?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“I have considered it thoroughly. Since she was sincere with me, I naturally had to be sincere with her. I can’t do something like accepting the favor of others without doing anything. I need your help to set up an array to seal off the aura of the Profound Wither Key.” Lin Yun said, already making up his mind.

“Okay.” Lil’ Purple no longer said a word as spiritual runes began to dance around her fingers, and it didn’t take long for her to set up a few arrays to envelop this entire space.

Seeing this, Lin Yun sat with his legs crossed and undid the second seal of the Profound Wither Key. The Profound Wither Key was hidden in his heart. So the moment the seal was undone, massive energy would flow out from his heart, soon enveloping him in a white light that was coursing throughout his body.

If it wasn’t for the array set up by Lil’ Purple, the white energy would definitely alarm many people. The energy from the Profound Wither Key was ten times purer than the divine astral pellets, and this was the gift and inheritance left for him by the Profound Wither Great Saint.

The immense energy left Lin Yun in great pain, like an erupting volcano that was trying to tear his body apart. But Lin Yun didn’t dare to be distracted and endured the pain. He could feel his internal organs, blood, bones, and the ocean of astral energy in his violet palace being refined by the energy from the Great Saint Origin.

Under immense pain, Lin Yun soon lost awareness of his surroundings because he was immersed in devouring the energy to make a breakthrough.

Very quickly, a day passed. When dawn came, An Liuyan arrived as promised. But she was shocked when she entered the room and saw Lin Yun.

Lin Yun sat cross-legged, enveloped in a faint light, emitting the aura of a four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. This aura was majestic and even stronger than many five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts that she had ever seen.

This wasn’t surprising because Lin Yun had a deep foundation, which meant that he would be stronger than those in the same cultivation. But she had no idea where Lin Yun got the resources to make a breakthrough to the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm in just one night.

“Y-You reached the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm?” An Liuyan exclaimed.

Lin Yun calmly opened his eyes before he said with a smile, “Let’s go. It’s time to meet the other experts invited by Lady An.”

“Oh, okay.” An Liuyan recollected herself, but she still couldn’t help being shocked while looking at Lin Yun. In the end, she couldn’t help but ask, “Young Master Lin, how did you do it?”

“Everyone has their own secrets.” Lin Yun didn’t explain that he ‘wasted’ a seal of the Profound Wither Key for this trip. There was no way and no need for him to talk about it.

Seeing Lin Yun wasn’t willing to share, An Liuyan no longer asked about it. It didn’t take long for her to bring Lin Yun to a majestic hall in the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion.

Several people were already there, and they were all emitting a powerful aura. When Lin Yun and An Liuyan arrived, several curious gazes were immediately directed over.

Lin Yun was also shocked because they were practically all demonic cultivators, and the baleful auras they were emitting was terrifying.

“This is the brat that stole my spot? Get lost!” Before they could sit down, a figure barged in and coldly looked at Lin Yun.

Seeing this, everyone was briefly stunned before they wore a smile. They knew that there was a show to watch now. Simultaneously, they were also surprised that An Liuyan would bring someone who was only at the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. After all, the six quotas were extremely precious, and they should have left yesterday if it wasn’t for Lin Yun.
