Chapter 541 - Spiritual Energy Rain

Outside the Profound Yin Lake, the ten core disciples were watching the competition by the shore. With their cultivation, they could naturally capture every detail. So they instantly noticed Huang Ling’s group blocking Lin Yun. Shortly after, their gazes turned to Mei Ziyan.

Everyone practically knew of Huang Ling’s relationship with Mei Ziyan. Mo Ling’s face was cold as she mocked, “Mei Ziyan, you seem to have a lot of tricks.”

Mei Ziyan wasn’t bothered by her mockery as he smiled, “What’s the matter? Are you feeling heartache for this brat? It’s a pity that no one can interfere with what happens in the lake. Even if you’re feeling heartache for him, you can only watch from here.”

“Hmmm?” Right at this moment, the other top ten core disciples looked at Lin Yun with surprise. This instantly attracted Mei Ziyan’s attention. When he looked up ahead, his face changed drastically.

The surface of the lake around Lin Yun was boiling and they could sense his aura from where they were. That was the aura in the greater Yin stage.

“Damn it. What’s going on?” Mei Ziyan’s face instantly became ugly.

“Probably all thanks to Junior Brother Mei’s Profound Yin Pellets. Without the five bottles of pellets, it wouldn’t be possible for Lin Yun to make a breakthrough so quickly,” said Mo Ling with mockery on her face. The other core disciples also looked at Mei Ziyan weirdly.

This humiliated Mei Ziyan. He wanted to dig a hole and hide in it right now. The five bottles he gave to Lin Yun had turned around to punch him in the mouth.

“So what if he’s in the greater Yin stage? I don’t believe he can defeat Huang Ling’s group,” said Mei Ziyan coldly.

“I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed,” said Mo Ling with a smile on her face. When Lin Yun was in the lesser Yin stage, he could already defeat those in the greater Yin stage. Now that he reached the greater Yin stage, how could he possibly lose to Huang Ling’s group? She was rather confident in Lin Yun.

On the lake, Lin Yun soared into the sky like a drawn sword. In the sky, four seals were formed in a split second as they combined together and smashed towards Huang Ling.

“Skybreaking Fist!” Huang Ling unleashed all his origin energy as he threw out a punch.

When the two fists collided, the four seals created with Lin Yun’s sword energy exploded, which tore apart Huang Ling’s attack and landed on his chest. Along with his ribs breaking, Huang Ling threw up a mouthful of blood and he was sent flying. His face was terrifyingly pale. He never expected that Lin Yun would be so strong having just made a breakthrough.

“And here I thought you were somebody. So it turns out that you’re pathetically weak.” Lin Yun glanced at Huang Ling, which scared him greatly. As for his companions, they didn’t even dare to take a step forward. “Go back and tell Mei Ziyan that I’ll use his pellets well. Tell him to come to me personally if he wants them instead of sending a few pieces of trash over to me.”

Huang Ling couldn’t even take his Dragon-Tiger Fist, so forget about Lin Yun’s Seven Slaughtering Seal. If Lin Yun brought out the Overlord Sword, then someone like Huang Ling would be killed instantly.

Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with them anymore and he continued heading to the heart of the lake. Huang Ling had wasted some of his time.

The other disciples watching Lin Yun were shocked. They were shocked by his strength. Probably only Yang Xiong, Lu Zhan, and Qi Wenxiong could deal with him. Lin Yun didn’t bother with other disciples, but he could sense a cold gaze locked onto him.

The gaze was from Mei Ziyan. For Mei Ziyan, he was destined to be disappointed if he thought that he could make a joke out of Lin Yun. Not only Huang Ling, but even Yang Xiong wouldn’t be able to stop Lin Yun.

Lin Yun moved like a bolt of lightning as he soared into the sky like an eagle. He was leaving groups of people behind him, instantly surpassing them.

“What speed!”

“This fellow is a monster!” The disciples who were surpassed by Lin Yun were all shocked.

About fifteen meters later, Lin Yun finally caught up with the disciples who were up ahead. Although he was still behind them, he could see the silhouettes of Yang Xiong, Lu Zhan, and Qi Wenxiong.

“They’re pretty quick,” smiled Lin Yun. He didn’t seem to be shocked by this scene. But when he saw Gong Ming and Bai Yi, he was shocked to see that they actually made it here so quickly. But shortly after, he wore a smile because he guessed that Gong Ming must have had a decent harvest from the bottle of pellets he gave him.

Lin Yun slowed down his pace on purpose as he walked over. The birth of the Profound Yin Flower would surely be accompanied by a phenomenon, so he wasn’t in a hurry. As for those people up ahead, their attention was on the heart of the lake, so they didn’t notice that Lin Yun had already caught up to them.

The spiritual energy here was so dense that the surface of the lake had formed into a spiritual energy vortex that seemed to be spinning slowly. Everyone knew that there was a ferocious undercurrent beneath it. If they weren’t careful, they would be devoured by it.

Suddenly, without warning, rain began to fall and many people stopped in their tracks. They reached out for the rain with joy and excitement on their faces.

“It’s the spiritual rain!”

“That’s the sign that the Profound Yin Flowers are appearing!” Everyone instantly stopped their movements, including Yang Xiong, Lu Zhan, and Qi Wenxiong. As the rain got bigger, everyone became even more excited. They could sense themselves getting stronger under the nourishment of the rain.

It didn’t take long for the vortex to spin faster. Under its fluctuation, the entire lake began to ripple. The pressure permeated the air and started to get stronger. As the rain and waves continued to roar, it made one feel like they were standing in the middle of a storm.

But all the disciples seemed to be nervously waiting for something. Not long after, icy beams began to shoot into the sky.

“The Profound Yin Flowers!” Everyone’s eyes lit up as they began to move out.

But Yang Xiong, Lu Zhan, and Qi Wenxiong merely swept a glance at them before they headed to the heart of the center of the spiritual energy vortex. Their target was the flower king.

“A seven petals Profound Yin Flower!” At the same time, a Profound Yin Flower drifted towards Bai Yi without warning. Bai Yi had joy on her face since seven petals were rare. She didn’t expect that she would be so lucky.

“Get lost!” But just when she was about to reach out for it, a barbaric figure charged over and shoved her away. Under the origin energy fluctuation, Bai Yi was sent flying away in pain. At the same time, the Profound Yin Flower that she had initially grabbed onto also flew away.

“You!” Bai Yi’s face turned red as she looked at the familiar figure who got in her way. It was the core disciple Gu Feng.

“You’re really naive. No one will take pity on you here. I, Gu Feng, will be taking this seven petals Profound Yin Flower. Hahaha!” Gu Feng’s eyes flashed with excitement. It might not be comparable to the nine petals flower king, but it was still a decent harvest.

But just when he was going to reach out for it, a figure shot over and snatched the flower from him. This enraged Gu Feng . But when he saw the person who snatched it from him, his face changed drastically as he quickly retreated. It was naturally Lin Yun that frightened him so greatly.

“How can you possibly snatch a lady’s flower?” Lin Yun sniffed the flower as he looked at Gu Feng with a smile. Then, Gu Feng felt a chill run down his spine as he recalled the humiliation he suffered outside the Infernal Realm.
