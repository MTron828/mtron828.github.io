Chapter 202 - Brothers

The group stood in front of the straw shack for a long time before they finally saw someone from Herbal Peak walking over. The one leading the group had an outstanding figure. Although they couldn’t see her appearance from afar, they had a feeling that her appearance wouldn’t be bad given her figure.

Niu Bingshun and the others looked at her from a distance. Their expressions changed and they began to tremble.

“Hey, not bad. We have a beauty coming,” Li Wuyou laughed while riding on the Dragon Blooded Horse.

“This woman is cold and arrogant. She looks down on everyone. She causes trouble every time she comes over and everyone is afraid of her,” Niu Bingshun replied with a bitter face.

“What’s her origin?” said Li Wuyou, smacking his tongue.

“Her name is Liu Yue, the Liu Clan’s missy. She has high attainment in alchemy and the Sword Firmament Pavilion values her greatly. This is the reason why she has a position at Herbal Peak from such a young age,” Niu Bingshun explained.

Lin Yun instantly understood. Herbal Peak might seem insignificant, but aside from the Pellet Hall, not many places can compare to it.

“Hush, they’re coming.”

A total of five people arrived, a woman and four men. The woman only looked to be sixteen or seventeen. She had exquisite features and emitted arrogance. Her cultivation was in the second stage of the Profound Martial Realm, one stage higher than Lin Yun. The four men following her were in their late twenties. Their cultivation was roughly in the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm.

Their ages indicated that they weren’t disciples and they didn’t seem like the type to do odd jobs. Lin Yun heard that those who were too old to be disciples and had connections in the Sword Firmament Pavilion could assume positions in specific halls. The stronger ones could even become elders to educate disciples. As for those without connections, they could only do odd jobs in various places, like Niu Bingshun.

“Greetings, Deacon Liu!” Niu Bingshun and the bows bowed respectfully.

Li Wuyou felt a little uncomfortable. But just when he was about to dismount the horse, Liu Yue frowned and lashed her whip over. Lin Yun was stunned by this. He never expected such a quiet and gentle looking lady to have such a fiery temper.

It was already too late for him to make his move. Li Wuyou’s back was whipped and he was thrown to the ground.

“What are you doing?” Li Wuyou immediately lost it. Just when he was about to charge forward, Lin Yun pulled him back. Everyone in Herbal Peak was lawless, so Liu Yue must have some sort of background for her to act so fearless.

Furthermore, Lin Yun wasn’t confident in taking care of the four guards around her. They wouldn’t benefit from fighting.

“Are you courting death? As someone who’s being punished, why aren’t you bowing when you see a deacon? You’re even riding on a horse? Do you want Deacon Liu to greet you instead?” Someone beside Liu Yue snapped.

“Haha, please calm down. He’s a newcomer, so he still doesn’t know about the rules. Please don’t get angry with him.” Niu Bingshun immediately stood out with some spiritual jades and handed them over.

When Liu Yue’s guards received the spiritual jades, their faces became a little better and they bowed to Liu Yue, “Deacon Liu, what should we do with these people?”

“It would be a surprise if people from Herbal Peak had manners. Go and examine the field quickly, I don’t wish to stay here for long. As for you… go away. Don’t get so close to me.” Liu Yue said and turned to Niu Bingshun in disgust.

Niu Bingshun wore an awkward expression. He was responsible for scattering fertilizer every day, so the stench wouldn’t go away no matter how much he showered himself. Upon hearing Liu Yue’s words, he immediately backed down. “Understood.”

Two guards executed their movement techniques and started checking the herbal field. Lin Yun pulled Li Wuyou to the side and started checking the wound on the latter’s back. Liu Yue was ruthless with her whip, leaving a huge gash on Li Wuyou’s back.

“That bitch is too much. She whipped me like livestock!” Li Wuyou clenched his teeth.

“Bear with it for now. She has experts in the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm around her,” Lin Yun replied.

“I know.” Li Wuyou sighed. He knew that there was no need to be impulsive right now. But suddenly, he raised his brow, “What is that bitch trying to do now?”

When Lin Yun turned around, he saw Liu Yue nodding her head while checking out the Dragon Blooded Horse. The Dragon Blooded Horse was in the Profound Martial Realm, so its size was majestic. When the sunlight shined on the crimson coat, there was a ruby like glow that created a domineering air around it.

“Let’s go and take a look.” The two of them walked back with grave expressions.

“Deacon Liu, no losses or damages since last month,” reported the two guards who went to examine the field.

Looking at the Dragon Blooded Horse, Liu Yue said indifferently, “Same old rules.”

“Hehe. We know, we know.” Niu Bingshun rushed into the straw shack before coming back out with an interspatial pouch. “These are the naturally damaged spiritual herbs this month. Please take a look at them. They’re all 100-year-old spiritual herbs and they still have at least 80% herbal effectiveness.”

The youth screened the interspatial pouch before nodding his head at Liu Yue, “The numbers are correct.”

Liu Yue nodded her head and took the spiritual herbs.

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by this scene. It didn’t matter how perfect the rules were because people could always create loopholes for their advantage.

The sect wouldn’t care about these matters as long as the majority of the spiritual herbs were fine. Even if they knew that something like this was happening, they would still turn a blind eye.

After the exchange was complete, the inspection team prepared to leave as Niu Bingshun spoke out respectfully, “Have a safe journey.”

But just when the four guards were about to leave, they noticed that Liu Yue wasn’t moving. Her gaze was fixed on the Dragon Blooded Horse.

When the guards saw that, they immediately understood her actions. One of them looked at Lin Yun and Li Wuyou, “Who does this Dragon Blooded Horse belong to? We will be borrowing it temporarily.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Scram! What are you guys trying to do?!” Li Wuyou immediately lost it and stood before the Dragon Blooded Horse.

“Brat, you want to be stubborn?” The guards were instantly enraged that garbage in the herbal field actually talked back to them. Everyone sent here were disciples who had committed crimes, so they definitely didn’t have any background.

“Stop.” Liu Yue spoke up right before a fight broke out. Even Lin Yun was baffled because he had no idea what Liu Yue wanted to do.

Liu Yue suddenly came to the herbal field and lashed her whip out on a plot before anyone could react. Before they knew it, the entire plot was destroyed. The origin energy rippling out from her whip had thoroughly destroyed the plot.

“Oh my god…” Niu Bingshun and the others were stunned. Their faces had turned white and a few of them even dropped on their butts. With so many spiritual herbs destroyed, their punishment would be extended for at least five years if the Herbal Hall pursued this matter.

“I never force others. Go back and report that there were a hundred spiritual herbs damaged in this field. Add another ten years to all of their punishments!” Liu Yue turned around.

Lin Yun and Li Wuyou both sucked in a cold breath from this woman’s cruelty. She wanted Lin Yun and Li Wuyou to beg her to accept the Dragon Blooded Horse. If they didn’t, they would be trapped in the Herbal Peak for ten years.

If it was someone else, they naturally knew what to choose between ten years of punishment and a Dragon Blooded Horse. But this woman clearly had no idea about Lin Yun’s background. There was no way Lin Yun would stay here for long.

Although he was sentenced here for three months, Xin Yan might come to fetch them way before that. Even if Xin Yan didn’t come get them, there was no way the sect would allow a genius who had grasped the complete sword intent with a Primordial Chaotic Soul to stay here.

In the end, only Niu Bingshun and the others would suffer from it.

Knowing that she was only pretending to leave, Lin Yun sighed, “Deacon Liu, please hold your steps.”

What happened next was within his expectations. The five people turned around when they heard him. Folding her arms together, an arc rose on Liu Yue’s lips, “What’s the matter?”

“You can just target me if you want. Why implicate the innocents in this matter? I’m willing to take the ten years punishment myself,” Lin Yun negotiated calmly.

“Is there anyone innocent in the Herbal Peak? I can pick anyone and they’ll either be bastards or lechers. Even if the spiritual herbs aren’t damaged, it’s not too much to keep them here for ten years,” Liu Yue sneered.

“What do you want then?” asked Lin Yun.

Liu Yue’s gaze fell on the Dragon Blooded Horse and replied, “I’ve already said that I never force others against their will.”

The meaning in her words was obvious. She wanted Lin Yun to get down on his knees and deliver the Dragon Blooded Horse to her.

“Haha. You can get lost then. We’re not afraid even if you keep us here for twenty years. Ten years is nothing!” Li Wuyou mocked.

“Is that so?? Then I’ll add another ten years to all your punishments!” Liu Yue’s eyes flashed with a hint of rage as she turned around with her guards.

“What are we going to do now…” Niu Bingshun and the others muttered in despair.

With a smile, Lin Yun looked at the silhouettes of Liu Yue’s group, “Wuyou, what do you think we should do now?”

“Hehe. I bear with her whip, but stomps on our heads. Why are we still putting up with her? We don’t even fear Wang Yan, so why should we be afraid of this bitch? I bet that she’ll turn around in ten seconds.” Li Wuyou smiled with a hint of murderous aura flashing across his eyes.

“I bet it’s within three seconds.” Lin Yun narrowed his eyes into slits.

This woman was possessive, but she was also prideful. She was trying to force them to hand the Dragon Blooded Horse over. She would definitely flip the table if something didn’t go her way.

While they were betting on how long it would take for her to turn her head around, Niu Bingshun and the others trembled in fear at their conversation. What are they doing? Are they going to act against Liu Yue?

Time slowly passed and before three breaths even passed, they saw Liu Yue return with her four guards.

When Li Wuyou looked at them returning, he smiled, “I lost…”

“Do you still remember what we said when we left the Sword Burial Woods?” Lin Yun asked without any changes in his expression.

“If we can’t endure it anymore, then there’s no need for us to endure.” Li Wuyou smiled, “But I prefer the part after that: as brothers, we will share our life and death together!”

“Go!” A cold light flickered across Lin Yun’s eyes. The two of them charged before Liu Yue and her guards reached them.
