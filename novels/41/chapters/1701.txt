Chapter 1702 – Vicious Heart

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion had thirty-six mountains, and the Cloud Fragrance Mountain was used to receive guests. Normally, no disciples would be here, but this place would become bustling with people whenever there was a challenge.

But today, the hall on the Cloud Fragrance Mountain was filled with people. When Lin Yun and Luo Shuyi landed on the ground, all the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples were briefly stunned before an uproar broke out amongst them.

“Lin Xiao is here!”

“What is he here for? That fellow is a barbarian, so it’s futile, even if he’s here.”

“I can’t figure out why someone like him, who hasn’t even displayed his music dao so far, can obtain a quota.”

“He’s so late when our enemies are already here. I bet he never considered himself a member of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.” The faces of the already depressed Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples became even darker when they saw Lin Yun.

After all, it was unavoidable for Lin Yun to attract hatred since he was too famous. There was a massive commotion in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion since he had obtained a quota before anyone realized it, and this naturally made all the disciples unhappy.

Sensing the surrounding enmity, Lin Yun knew that there were a lot of rumors revolving around him recently, but he never expected that their hostility would be so massive. Honestly speaking, he wasn’t too fond of the surrounding atmosphere.

“Lin Xiao, what are you doing here?” Zhang Mu stepped out from the crowd and came before Lin Yun. Beside him were Xiang Feiluan and Zuo Hongyun. Their faces were pale, and they were clearly heavily injured.

Seeing this, Lin Yun instantly knew that the three must’ve fought and were defeated.

Looking at Lin Yun, Xiang Feiluan said, “You’re here to see us make a joke out of ourselves, right?”

“Young Master Lin is here to help us win…” Luo Shuyi quickly explained.

“Him? The three of us were defeated, so what can he do?” Zhang Mu snorted with disdain flickering within his pupils.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he knew that these people were from the Divine Dragon Empire’s ancient Ice Domain and were prideful. They were the ones who held back during their performance at the Saint Altar back then. So Lin Yun didn’t waste time talking to them and walked through the crowd; he wanted to see who was fighting in the hall.

“Can he really turn the tables around?” Zuo Hongyun asked.

“Bullshit. He’ll only embarrass himself…” Zhang Mu said coldly. His hostility for Lin Yun was deep. He felt that Lin Yun had stolen his opportunity. If he had received personal guidance from Mu Xueling, he wouldn’t have lost today.

“Let’s go and take a look.” The trio said with their faces dark.

When Lin Yun and Luo Shuyi came forth, they saw Lin Wan fighting with a woman. This woman was prideful while placing a bamboo flute by her lips.

“That person is one of the prominent younger disciples in the Exquisite Court. Her mental cultivation has reached the pinnacle of sixth grade, and I heard that she has already grasped the high-grade Noble Tone. She’s only one step away from complete mastery.” Luo Shuyi explained beside Lin Yun.

Lin Yun nodded his head. Lin Wan might not be from an Ancient Saint Clan, but she’s the chief disciple of the Heavenly Note Sect, and she wasn’t weak. Not to mention that she had gone to the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

One person played the lute while the other played the flute, and they both had high attainment in music dao. They played powerful scores, and their music manifested into various phenomena. The phenomena the person playing the flute manifested was terrifying with countless musical notes manifesting into crimson serpents.

The crimson serpents were gorgeous, but they had a lethality beneath their beauty. No matter how beautiful they were, those were venomous serpents, which was a rare form of music dao.

On the other hand, Lin Wan fought firmly with her lute, stopping those serpents from getting close to her. Lin Yun’s gaze passed over them and landed in the Exquisite Court’s direction. Aside from some elders from the Exquisite Court, there was a purple-robed man. This person was dashing, but his gaze was terrifyingly cold.

Lin Yun could sense a powerful mental energy being emitted from him. This person had probably reached the seventh-grade Saint Spiritualist, and anyone could tell he wasn’t a pushover.

“That person is Xu Dongfei, the strongest of the Exquisite Court’s younger generation. He was arrogant earlier and even asked the Profound Fairy to face his challenge.” Luo Shuyi continued. Her eyes were filled with disgust and lingering fear when she looked at Xu Dongfei.

While Lin Yun and Luo Shuyi were talking amongst themselves, many people from the Exquisite Court noticed Lin Yun. After all, they had caused quite a commotion when they arrived. Thus, their gazes were attracted to them as Lin Yun and Luo Shuyi came forth.

“Who’s that person?”

“A new disciple that the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion recruited?”

“I never heard of him before.”

While the Exquisite Court’s disciples were discussing amongst themselves, Xu Dongfei said, “Even the Ancient Saint Clan’s geniuses like Xiang Feiluan have failed, so it’s useless even if he comes. Today, I have to force their Profound Fairy to come out. It’s futile, no matter who comes!”

“That’s right. We can only thoroughly step on the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion by defeating the Profound Fairy.”

“It’s best to defeat them openly and make them embarrassed. At that time, the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion won’t have the face to head to the Nirvana Banquet.” The Exquisite Court’s disciples echoed alongside Xu Dongfei.

The Exquisite Court didn’t conceal their voices, making Lin Yun wonder just how great their enmity was against Yue Weiwei. He could clearly hear their voices, and the chill within his pupils grew even denser. It was fine if they had no enmity for him and only had enmity for the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion because Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with that. But having such a massive enmity against Lin Yun was a different story.

In the past, he wasn’t bothered since he didn’t know that the Profound Fairy was Yue Weiwei. But since he already knew about her, he couldn’t ignore it. If they wanted to bully Yue Weiwei, they would have to ask if he would agree!

“If this is the best you can do, I can’t be bothered to play with you anymore.” The Exquisite Court’s disciple lowered her flute and looked at Lin Wan with a cold flash in her pupils.

Lin Wan merely glanced at her opponent before she said, “That’ll depend on how capable you are!”

“Hmph!” The Exquisite Court’s disciple raised the flute back to her lips. Her flute music suddenly became sharp like a venomous serpent with halos of crimson light spreading out. The next moment, the crimson light manifested into multiple crimson serpents that descended towards Lin Wan.

The venomous serpents soon filled Lin Wan’s sight. As she strummed the lute even faster, rings of crimson sound waves spread out.

As countless venomous serpents fell from the sky like a crimson rainfall, the Exquisite Court’s disciple, Lan Hongyan, smiled as she began to move about in the hall, leaving behind crimson afterimages. As her flute and her figure changed, it made it harder for others to catch her, and this was enough to prove that she had plenty of fighting experience.

But coincidentally, Lin Wan came from Ancient Barren Domain, not to mention that she had experienced the Ancient Barren Battlefield. So this didn’t make her panic, and she soon found a solution to deal with Lan Hongyan.

As her figure began to move about like a piece of paper, her footsteps were even more bizarre than Lan Hongyan's. It didn’t take long for her to put Lan Hongyan in a difficult position with various phenomena being destroyed. It was so much so that flaws started appearing in Lan Hongyan’s music, and her aura became chaotic.

“Senior Sister Lin is going to win!”

“We’re finally going to obtain a victory after three losses!” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples were excited, and a smile rose on their faces. After all, they had too much pent-up with three losses.

But Lin Yun lightly furrowed his brows, and he had an ill premonition.

“What’s wrong?” Luo Shuyi smiled, seeing that Lin Wan was going to win. But when she noticed Lin Yun’s expression, she couldn’t help being worried.

“It’s a little troublesome…” Lin Yun noticed that the Exquisite Court’s party didn’t panic and even seemed confident, as if they weren’t worried for Lan Hongyan. Suddenly, his face changed, “Not good!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Executing his Divine Dragon Eyes, he soon noticed something wasn’t right. When Lan Hongyan blew on her flute, crimson powder was drifting out of her flute and merged with her music. When the powder fused with the surrounding phenomenon, the powder became even more sinister.

He instantly knew that the powder was poison, and that made his face turn cold. Although they didn’t say any rules in the fight, using poison in an official battle was still despicable.

Suddenly, Lin Wan felt powerless and threw out a mouthful of blood. The blood that she threw out was black, and it was terrifying.

“Senior Sister Lin!” Exclamations resounded while everyone became worried about Lin Wan.

On the other hand, Xu Dongfei smiled and commented, “This battle has come to an end.”

The serpents took this opportunity to bite Lin Wan. But that wasn’t all. Lan Hongyan had no intentions of stopping and continued to play her flute. A hundred-foot serpent suddenly pounced forth, baring its jaws at Lin Wan.

“No!” Luo Shuyi’s face changed.

But just when the serpent was about to bite Lin Wan, a hand appeared behind her and gently waved. As a thunderstorm rampaged along with a dragon roar, countless dragon runes condensed into a dragon’s head, letting out a roar in the direction of the crimson serpent and crushing its head before anyone could react.

As crimson rainfall fell from the sky, Lin Wan was stunned as she turned to see a familiar figure.

“Aren’t you a little too vicious for a woman? You already won the fight, but you still want to take her life? Is everyone from the Exquisite Court as vicious as you?” Lin Yun turned to coldly look at the Exquisite Court’s party.

When he said those words, the faces of everyone from the Exquisite Court sank.
