Chapter 612 - Race Against Time

“Time to kick some people out,” said Qin An after he sheathed his sword.

Pei Yue nodded his head and asked, “Who are we going to start with?”

“Xie Yunqiao!” Pei Yue said with indifference on his face.

“I happen to share the same thoughts. Xie Yunqiao is weaker than Ji Wuye and Yan Kong. Aside from his xiantian sword intent in greater mastery, we don’t have to be too concerned with him,” smiled Qin An. He continued, “Ji Wuye and Yan Kong aren’t on good terms with each other. They will definitely fight if they run into each other. Let’s deal with Xie Yunqiao first on the seventh level before dealing with Ji Wuye or Yan Kong on the eighth level. As for others, I don’t think anyone can make it through the eighth trial.”

They had a pretty good plan where they would be the only ones left on the ninth level if everything went well. At that time, they could have the empyrean’s legacy and Astral Pearl all to themselves. Without any hesitation, they headed for the seventh trial together, “Let’s go!”

At the border of the Withernorth Sea, there was a commotion when the next batch was sent out, especially when they saw Guo Xu and Yang Fan. Even those two were eliminated, which meant that there were less than ten people in the empyrean’s tomb now.

“Who did this to you?” Guo Xu caused an uproar among the elders when he returned to the Thunderflame Sect’s camp. After all, Guo Xu’s injuries were too horrifying.

“Was it Xie Yunqiao?” An elder quickly noticed that Guo Xu’s injuries were left behind by sword attacks and he instantly connected it with Xie Yunqiao, who was still in the empyreans’ tomb. After all, he couldn’t think of another person who could inflict sword injuries on Guo Xu.

Guo Xu smiled bitterly when he heard that. He wouldn’t feel so much resentment if it was Xie Yunqiao who defeated him. “No, not him…”

But just when Guo Xu was about to reveal Lin Yun’s name, he suddenly recalled Bai Lixuan’s warning and shook his head. Furthermore, he also couldn’t reveal that he was defeated by someone outside the ranking. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When no one else was teleported out, the various sects’ elders began to discuss among themselves. It wasn’t a secret that Guo Xu and Yang Fan were teleported out. This meant that the rest must’ve gotten through the seventh trial.

“I heard that there was an empyrean who passed by the Ancient Southern Domain a century ago and no Heavenly Soul Realm experts dared to attack him. An empyrean of the modern era was already so powerful, so how horrifying would an empyrean from the ancient age be?”

“There are only two trials left. I wonder who will be the last one standing.”

“Probably Ji Wuye or Yan Kong. Those two fiendgods aren’t out yet.”

“Qin An, Pei Yue, and Xie Yunqiao must be inside as well. This means that there are only five people left and they are all in the top ten on the outer ranking.”

“Wrong, there’s also Bai Lixuan from the Cloud Trigram Sect who possesses the Saint Physique. His name will probably spread throughout the Ancient Southern Domain after this event.”

“There shouldn’t be anyone else aside from him, right?”

“Don’t forget about Flower Burial Lin Yun. He was the one who defeated Cao Zhen from the Northern Snow Manor. I also heard that he killed Leng Haoyu and received a palm from Ji Wuye unharmed.”

“Is that real? Isn’t it a little exaggerated?”

The Withernorth Sea became noisy, especially since Bai Lixuan and Lin Yun were still within the empyrean’s tomb. In the past year, many geniuses rose up in the nine prefectures and there were many newcomers who challenged the elites on the ranking. Coincidentally, the Draconic Banquet was starting this year, so the empyrean’s tomb was an opportunity for them.

To those from the Heavenly Province Academy, Lin Yun might not be one of their disciples, but he still held the status as a guest deacon. So everyone from the academy became emotional when they heard that. If Lin Yun could make it through the ninth trial, then it would shine a great light on the academy.

As for those on the Cloud Trigram Sect, they were excited that Xie Yunqiao and Bai Lixuan were still within the empyrean’s tomb. Among all the sects here, only the Cloud Trigram Sect still had two disciples in the tomb. This achievement was more than enough to shine glory upon their sect.

But right at this moment, a figure donned in blue clothes suddenly landed on the ground. He was staggering out of the sandstorm with a pale face. His entire body was covered with injuries and everyone exclaimed when they saw his appearance. It was Xie Yunqian who was ranked eighth on the outer ranking.

“H-how did he get eliminated?”

“This makes no sense. He should be able to get through the ninth trial with his strength. This should only be the eighth trial…”

“Yeah, it makes no sense. If Xie Yunqiao can’t get through the ninth trial, then no one else can. After all, his xiantian sword intent is in greater mastery!”

“Look at his injuries. He must’ve fought and lost to someone. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so injured.” Xie Yunqiao’s sudden appearance had caused a huge commotion. After all, Xie Yunqiao was someone who had at least 40% odds against Ji Wuye or Yan Kong. Many people were optimistic that he might be the last one standing, which was why they were so shocked.

The discussion suddenly calmed down. They instantly realized that something must have happened to cause someone like Xie Yunqiao to be eliminated. In their eyes, he must have been eliminated by Ji Wuye or Yan Kong.

Lin Yun’s face was pale with exhaustion on the eighth level. The eighth trial was tougher than he had imagined. The cooperation between the eight puppets was nearly perfect and Lin Yun could only face them head-on to force them to make a mistake.

This meant that he would lose the opportunity and would have to start again if he missed his chance. But fortunately, swordsmen were famed for their offensive capabilities. With complete mastery in his xiantian sword intent, Lin Yun had a keen sense for flaws.

But even so, the eighth trial wasn’t an easy one since he couldn’t use the Flower Burial Sword. He also guessed that he might be the first person to reach the eighth level.

Others might try and search the seventh level, but Lin Yun didn’t bother staying long. After he made it through the seventh trial, he executed the Seven Profound Steps and rushed to the eighth trial. If his xiantian sword intent wasn’t in complete mastery, there was no way he could get through so quickly.

“This means that I’m ahead of everyone, and I should have some time left,” muttered Lin Yun. He now had three choices before him. His first two options were to search the eighth level or to head for the ninth trial. As for the third choice, it was somewhat risky as he would try practicing the Azure Dragon Enneaform to increase his fighting prowess.

Others might fall into a dilemma if they were placed with the choices, but Lin Yun has always been decisive, so he made his mind in the blink of an eye. After all, the Astral Pearl had been his target from the start. Since those in the inner ranking had martial souls at the eighth profound grade when they reached the Yin-Yang stage, he naturally had to do the same. Otherwise, how could he fight with them during the Draconic Banquet?

“I’m doing it!” Lin Yun found a secret chamber and patted his interspatial pouch to retrieve the jade slip with the Azure Dragon Enneaform recorded on it. The jade slip was still shrouded in lightning along with the coiled dragon.

Anyone could tell that this wasn’t ordinary with just a glance. Furthermore, it was also recorded that the Azure Dragon Enneaform was just the body-refining technique of the Azure Dragon Art. The Azure Dragon Art still had a cultivation technique, movement technique, finger technique, and a palm technique, not to mention a sword sutra and secret technique.

This was a comprehensive martial technique that consisted of everything back in the golden era. Even if Lin Yun could only learn one of the techniques, it was more than enough for him to overlook everyone in the Ancient Southern Domain if he brought it to the pinnacle.

Lin Yun knew that he couldn’t rush with a martial technique of this level, but he didn’t have many options laid before him. He knew that it wouldn’t be easy in the ninth level and that there would be a tough battle awaiting him. So if he didn’t have the strength, how could he compete with the likes of Ji Wuye and Yan Kong?

This was why Lin Yun had to gamble. After all, it would be a great victory if he succeeded. At the same time, Ji Wuye, Yan Kong, Qin An, Pei Yue, and Bai Lixuan had started the eighth trial.
