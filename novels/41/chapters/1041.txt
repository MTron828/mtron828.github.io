Chapter 1042 - Golden Crow As Heaven, Silver Phoenix As Earth

Luo Chen’s party was pretty efficient as it only took them two days to round up all the Blood Flame Pellets and Azure Dragon True Liquid from the market. Then again, it was all thanks to the 50,000 Divine Astral Pellets. The Divine Astral Pellets were a treasure that made it easy to sweep through the market.

After all, Lin Yun instructed Luo Chen to buy everything no matter the cost. Naturally, they overpaid for everything, but now Lin Yun had them. Additionally, Luo Chen bought information about the Realm Sons. All three of them were in the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm and they had high level martial intents. Furthermore, all three of them had grasped a few secret techniques.

“I also heard that the Realm Sons grasped Holy Spirit Martial Techniques before entering the Heavenly Path…” Luo Chen said softly, not daring to look at Lin Yun’s face. After all, Holy Spirit Martial Techniques transcended fortune. This meant that they could practically suppress and kill anyone they wanted to in the Heavenly Path.

“Got it,” replied Lin Yun. It was just as he had speculated, which is why he avoided the fight in the Yellow Sandy Plain. Back then, he could sense a dangerous aura coming from the Realm Sons. It would have been dangerous for him to fight them without grasping the Divine Solar Lunar Fist.

“It’s hard to learn holy spirit martial techniques. Even if they managed to learn one, they probably only reached a shallow level,” comforted Luo Chen. Lin Yun smiled at this because Luo Chen had no idea how unbelievably strong a holy spirit martial technique at its most basic level was.

“Here, there’s 350 Blood Flame Pellets. As for the True Dragon Saint Liquid, they’re simply too rare to find, so we only managed to obtain 17. As for the remaining Divine Astral Pellets, we did as you said and bought herbs that can nourish and refine vitality. After all that, you have 20,000 Divine Astral Pellets left,” said Luo Chen. Then, he handed the Blood Flame Pellets and True Dragon Saint Liquid to Lin Yun.

“That’s more than enough!” Lin Yun’s eyes shined brightly because this had exceeded his expectations. If there were more, he might not be able to refine them within fifteen days. Lin Yun only took 10,000 Divine Astral Pellets for his breakthrough and gave the other half to Luo Chen’s group. “These 10,000 Divine Astral Pellets are for all of you.”

The three of them were really tempted by the pellets, but they rejected them because it was precious to Lin Yun. All they did was run an errand for Lin Yun, so they didn’t believe that they deserved the Divine Astral Pellets.

“Go on and take them. I don’t know if I’ll come out of this unscathed, so the war realms will benefit if you don’t take them.” Lin Yun smiled and shoved the Divine Astral Pellets to Luo Chen. “I have some friends from the Profound Amber Realm, and they should be making their way to Four Phase City. I hope that you guys can help me take care of them after I leave.”

“Of course,” said Luo Chen’s group.

“Lin Yun, I still have something to tell you…” Luo Chen spoke after a brief moment of hesitation.

“What is it?” asked Lin Yun.

“It’s regarding the war realms… we all know that the war realms have an extraordinary origin and a strong foundation in the Kunlun Realm. We just found out that the war realms are saint clans in the Kunlun Realm. At the very least, they’re stronger than king clans.”

Lin Yun was shocked as the foundation of the war realms surprised him once again. Saints were powerful existences that Lin Yun couldn’t evaluate with his current strength. Plus, everyone below the Saint level was simply an ant.

“The war realms are extremely unique and only the saint clans can occupy them. Even the powerful sects in Kunlun Realm are wary of the saint clans. After all, the elders of some of the powerful sects came from the saint clans. So the Demon Slaughtering Assembly is nothing but a game to them…” Luo Chen said after a brief pause to examine Lin Yun’s complexion.

Contrary to Luo Chen’s expectation, Lin Yun didn’t have a change in his expression. However, once they left, Lin Yun’s eyes shined with cold light. “So they think that they can do whatever they want because of that?”

He was very furious at this moment. So it turns out that the life and death trial that everyone had been going through was nothing but a game to the war realms. But even so, it had nothing to do with Lin Yun. He was just furious that the starting point for everyone to reach the Kunlun Realm was a game to the war realms.

“I’m sorry, but this isn’t a game,” muttered Lin Yun. No one could treat the life and death of others as a game. Then, he took out three Blood Flame Pellets. “I have to hasten my improvement.”

Lin Yun popped the three Bloodflame Pellets into his mouth. His previous speed was too slow. If he kept the same pace, he might not reach greater mastery.

The pain was terrible to bear as he pushed his cultivation to the limit. It felt like his bones would melt. Releasing a ferocious roar, the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix flew out of his body.

“Heaven and Earth, Unite!” Lin Yun roared while the spirits descended from the sky and enveloped Lin Yun’s arm. Heaven and earth started to tremble while the lake shook.

When the rays of light merged, an energy sphere emitting a primal chaos aura appeared in Lin Yun’s hand. When he fell into deep thoughts, he suddenly grasped the secret of the move.

The sun was the heavens and the moon was the earth. When the sun and moon combined, it would return all creation back to primal chaos. Then again, there was no way that the energy in his hand was the genuine primal chaos. It only contained some of the primal chaos’ profundity. But even so, he could sense how powerful this move was.

As the primal chaos energy began to circulate in his palm, it began to emit beam after beam of terrifying energy. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Perhaps my ideas were right.” Lin Yun waved his hand, dispersing the primal chaos energy in his palm. At this moment, most of his vitality and energy were drained.

Before Lin Yun caught his breath, he took three more Blood Flame Pellets. Yue Weiwei was still suffering in Wind Mound City, so how could he possibly rest? Now that he had grasped the essence of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist, he had to manifest heaven with the Golden Crow and earth with the Silver Phoenix.

In the blink of an eye, three days passed. Up to this point, Lin Yun had consumed 200 Blood Flame Pellets. His vitality was overflowing as if he was past the shackles of the Heavenly Soul Realm.His physique had greatly benefited from the Blood Flame Pellets, so it was dangerous for him to continue.

“I’m already at my limit. If I don’t succeed, then all my efforts have gone down the drain. I’ll need a few months to recover and get back to this point.” Lin Yun took a deep breath. He wanted to reach complete mastery in his new attack, but he was teetering between the perfect amount of ambition and foolishness.

“Golden Crow as heaven!” Lin Yun roared, summoning the Golden Crow spirit from his body. Compared to three days ago, the wingspan of the Golden Crow was now ten feet long.

The golden crow flew in the sky and began to release halos of light out of its body. The entire sky was dyed gold, but Lin Yun wasn’t stopping. “Silver phoenix as the earth!”

Similarly, a Silver Phoenix flew out of his body and turned into a silver lake. Standing at the center of the lake, Lin Yun’s hair began to flutter in the wind while beads of sweat covered his forehead. He was trying his best to contain the vitality in his body, but he was on the brink of collapse.

“HEAVEN AND EARTH! UNITE!” Lin Yun roared as he unleashed a terrifying aura into the surroundings. All light was swallowed by the gold and silver spirit in a span of seconds.

As boundless energy began to pour into Lin Yun’s body, he emitted a dazzling brilliance. His black hair fluttered wildly in the wind as he circulated primal chaos energy in his palm. The boundless energy within his body was trembling like a beating heart, which caused heaven and earth to tremble along.

“Finally! It’s a success!” Lin Yun had the joy on his pale face while excitement flickered in his eyes. Letting out another roar, Lin Yun dissipated the primal chaos energy in his palm and restored light to heaven and earth. He didn’t dare to throw this punch out because he knew that it wouldn’t be as simple as destroying a flame vein. In the worst case scenario, he might even destroy nearby districts.
