Chapter 162 - Mighty Return

The atmosphere in the North Point Plaza suddenly froze, leaving everyone in the auction stunned. Who was it that dared to cause trouble in the North Point Plaza? The North Point Plaza controlled the Azure Sun City’s black market and the forces behind them weren’t any weaker than the branches of the three overlord forces.

When the middle-aged man saw the man who spoke, he was immediately drenched in cold sweat. How could there be such a terrifying gaze? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Rustle!

The newcomer suddenly soared through the sky, charging at the auction without any hesitation.

“You must be courting death to cause trouble in the North Point Plaza. Stop him!” The middle-aged man roared as his face changed. In the next second, several sixth orifice cultivators charged at the newcomer.

“Fuck off.” The newcomer snorted. His aura surged and he threw out a punch. The punch contained sword aura that blasted everyone, sweeping across the sixth orifice cultivators who were charging at him.

From the huge collision, four of the sixth orifice cultivators were blown away with blood gushing out of their mouths. They couldn’t even receive a single move.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The four of them fell, crashing into the guests who couldn’t dodge in time. The tables and chairs were reduced to dust. The entire auction instantly went into chaos. Everyone stood up at the same time as their faces changed.

Fear flickered in the eyes of the middle-aged man as he turned around. He wanted to escape.

“Do you think that you can run away?” asked the newcomer.

The newcomer landed on the auction stage and unleashed his aura. Suffering the suppression of this aura, the middle-aged man felt that he had fallen into a swamp.

The middle-aged man’s face turned red. He felt suffocated and swung his hands wildly in the air. Only then was everyone able to get a clear look at the newcomer.

“My heavens! It’s Lin Yun!”

Those who saw Lin Yun in the Azure Sun Realm exclaimed out.

“Lin Yun?! How is that possible! Wasn’t he forced into the Yin Wind Stream by Bai Lixuan?”

“It’s that bastard!” The Ominous Three immediately recognized Lin Yun. Their hatred for Lin Yun ran deep in their bones.

Lin Yun’s clothes were a combination of azure and white. Looking at that sword box behind him and his handsome appearance, who could he be if he wasn’t Lin Yun?

The sudden development in the situation caused a stir in the entire North Point Plaza. Many people had a shock on their faces as they looked at the young man on the stage.

“This is Lin Yun?”

“That’s right! It’s him! Back in the Azure Sun Realm, everyone had witnessed how he extorted 20,000 Xiantian pellets from the Golden Flame Sect and Blood Cloud Sect!”

“What an entrance. But isn’t he courting death by causing trouble in the North Point Plaza? Doesn’t he know that the Blood Cloud Sect and Golden Flame Sect have their branches here?”

“That’s not for certain. He’s someone who even dared to offend Bai Lixuan in the Azure Sun Realm. Since he dares to come here, there must be something extraordinary about him.”

“I heard that he even outshined Bai Lixuan and Si Xueyi in the Sky Piercer Altar.”

“That’s right. He even received an ancient Profound Martial Technique. He must be powerful and he cannot be underestimated. Let’s just stay here and watch the show…”

The commotion from the surrounding rang out when Lin Yun appeared. Shortly after, the news of Lin Yun’s appearance soon spread out in the Azure Sun City. Everyone thought that Lin Yun had died, but they were shocked when they heard that Lin Yun returned.

Standing on the stage, Lin Yun snorted just when the middle-aged man was about to suffocate to death. The middle-aged man was tossed aside and heavily crashed onto the firm ground.

Raising his hand, a suction force exploded from Lin Yun’s palm as he pulled the whip over. He had no intention of letting this person off so easily.

“Weren’t you pretty mighty a second ago?” Lin Yun coldly looked at the middle-aged man. His trembling voice contained uncontrollable killing intent.

Lin Yun was covered in dust because he had rushed to get here and he witnessed the Dragon Blooded Horse tearing up. One could imagine how much pain the Dragon Blooded Horse was suffering since it wasn’t easy to wound it with its defense.

“Please, spare me. I’m only under orders. Sir Lin, please let me go.” The middle-aged man no longer had his temper from a moment ago and began begging for his life.

“You’re not going to answer my question?” retorted Lin Yun.

Plap!

Lin Yun’s face sank and he whipped the middle-aged man. The whip lashed down and the middle-aged man was covered in blood. A blood-curdling howl came out of his mouth. When the howl rang out, everyone was shocked. They knew how vicious the whip was because the middle-aged man had used it on the Dragon Blooded Horse.

Plap! Plap! Plap!

Raising the whip, Lin Yun lashed it down at the middle-aged man without any hesitation.

“Lin Yun, you bastard! Whip me to death if you dare! I’ll see how you walk out of this North Point Plaza alive!” The middle-aged man’s face turned sinister and distorted from the pain.

“Don’t worry about it. No one will be able to save you today!” Lin Yun replied coldly.

But just as he was about to whip him once more, a cold bark sounded out, “Stop!” A powerful aura swept through the surrounding.

Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!

At the same time, Xiantian Realm cultivators began to arrive. In the blink of an eye, the entire auction was surrounded.

Raising his brow, Lin Yun wrapped his whip around the middle-aged man. When he raised his head, he saw a robust man that emitted a strong aura. Evidently, he had reached the Quasi-Profound Martial Realm.

The Quasi-Profound Martial Realm was only achieved by surpassing the seventh stage of the Xiantian Realm. It was just below the Profound Martial Realm.

“Lord North Point is here!”

“I’ve been here for many years, but this is my first time seeing Lord North Point in person.”

“I heard that he has been trying to make a breakthrough into the Profound Martial Realm. It looks like it’s not fake.”

The surrounding atmosphere suddenly became intense.

Looking at the middle-aged man beneath Lin Yun’s feet, North Point roared, “You’re pretty arrogant for your age. Let him go immediately and leave behind 10,000 Xiantian pellets. Otherwise, I guarantee that you will not be able to leave the North Point Plaza today.”

“You still don’t get it, do you?” Lin Yun coldly replied. He stomped his foot on the middle-aged man beneath him, causing the middle-aged man’s internal organs to rupture.

“You!” North Point’s face paled as he witnessed Lin Yun killing his own man in front of him.

When the middle-aged man tortured the Dragon Blooded Horse, Lin Yun had already decreed his death.

“I already said that no one can save him today.” Lin Yun lightly muttered.

“You’re courting death!” shouted North Point.

Boom!

The terrifying aura that belonged to a Quasi-Profound Martial Realm generated from North Point.

“Is he crazy? A fifth orifice cultivator actually dares to fight a Quasi-Profound Martial Realm?!”

Looking at North Point’s rage, everyone’s expression changed. They had no idea where Lin Yun found the courage to challenge a Quasi-Profound Martial Realm.

As North Point flew, his spiritual energy reverberated within his body. He raised his hand and sent a palm in Lin Yun’s direction.

“Sky Shattering Palm!”

Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!

When that terrifying palm flew out, a series of bursts rang throughout the air. Every time the bony palm landed, spiritual energy gathered and it grew more powerful. When the palm reached Lin Yun, the power had reached a terrifying height and produced a crack in the sky.

North Point’s face was cold. He had attacked without the intention of keeping Lin Yun alive. Under the situation where there was a difference of two stages in their cultivation, he was certain that Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to move under his oppression. Simultaneously, he was certain that Lin Yun would die here.

“Is this your strongest move?”

But North Point was disappointed when he saw Lin Yun sneer at his attack. The blazing Iris Flower also began to bloom in Lin Yun’s Dantian.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

A powerful sword aura exploded from his body. A total of twenty-four petals bloomed, crumbling North Point’s aura. Lin Yun took a step forward and clenched his teeth. In the next second, his robust spiritual energy gushed out like a tidal wave.

The fusion of fist and sword, the combination of tough and soft!

Lin Yun pushed out his palm, facing North Point’s palm without dodging.

“You’re courting death.” North Point’s eyes flashed with a hint of brutality because Lin Yun actually dared to face him head-on with the cultivation of the fifth orifice of the Xiantian Realm. The spiritual energy within his body began to surge violently, as if it wanted to break Lin Yun’s arm.

Boom!

But when the palm and punch collided, North Point issued a blood-curdling howl. Not only was Lin Yun’s arm fine, but North Point’s palm was covered in blood. In fact, his wounds even revealed the bones. All of this was due to Lin Yun’s sword aura.

“Is that all you got?” Lin Yun sneered and launched another attack.

Whoosh!

Lin Yun’s punch was like a meat grinder that swept towards North Point’s arm. Under everyone’s gaze, North Point’s arm was broken.

North Point’s face was terrifyingly pale and he immediately retreated. When he regained his footing, he looked at Lin Yun with fear in his eyes. Even the other spectators in the auction were dead silent.

No one could imagine that North Point, someone in the Quasi-Profound Martial Realm, would actually suffer such a huge loss at Lin Yun’s hand. He only used a single punch to defeat North Point.

“What cultivation technique did you cultivate…” North Point looked at Lin Yun as the pain distorted his face.

Letting out a snort, Lin Yun replied, “It doesn’t concern you. Do you still need me to leave behind 10,000 Xiantian pellets now?”

“N-no. There’s no need for that. I apologize for my rudeness from before,” replied North POint.

Lin Yun asked, “Then, can I bring the Dragon Blooded Horse with me?”

North Point responded, “Sir Lin, you can leave whenever you want.”

North Point was terrified by Lin Yun’s punch that crippled his arm. How could he dare to be arrogant after that?

“North Point, you piece of trash. Since when did you have the authority to decide the auction item given to you by us, the Ominous Three?” A discordant voice suddenly sounded out when Lin Yun was about to leave with the Dragon Blooded Horse.
