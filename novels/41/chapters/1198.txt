Chapter 1199 - Cold Flash

Facing the sword rays, Lin Yun almost drew his sword out of habit. However, the Flower Burial Sword released a buzz that woke Lin Yun up. The core of the Hundred Ghost Sword Array was his sword, and he would be in trouble if he drew his sword.

Thinking about what Ye Feifan’s warning, Lin Yun suddenly figured out a clue. Perhaps it wasn’t because the challengers neglected the first round, but because they discovered the strange aspect of the array. If a swordsmen couldn’t draw their sword, their strength would be restricted.

Lin Yun couldn’t think of any other reason that the challengers would fail. Others could only see that challengers were covered in injuries, but they didn’t know the secret behind the array. Lin Yun felt a chill run down his spine because it was too late for him to retreat.

Lin Yun pushed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations to the limit and weaved through the sword rays. His movement technique left the audience shocked, but even so, Lin Yun was hit three times and his clothes were dyed red from his blood. Fortunately, none of the wounds were fatal.

“Kill!” When he landed on the ground, a hundred swordsmen charged toward Lin Yun. Although Lin Yun couldn’t draw his sword, his method of dealing with the hundred swordsmen was breathtaking. However, he had to face at least ten people at once for each wave that charged at him.

“What’s going on? Why isn’t Lin Yun drawing his sword?”

“How can he possibly last without drawing his sword?”

“If he doesn’t draw his sword, the power of his attacks would be weakened by at least 50%. What is Lin Yun doing?” The crowd was baffled by Lin Yun’s actions. Although they didn’t believe he could take the sword, they believed he could pass the first array.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun was facing an endless wave of enemies that was putting him in a dangerous spot.

“Don’t tell me that this brat managed to see through the array.” The Grand Elder of the Feng Clan’s face changed when Lin Yun didn’t draw his sword.

“So what? He’ll still die a terrible death,” sneered Feng Xuanzi.

“Of course.” The elders of Feng Clan laughed when they heard what Feng Xuanzi said. This was a blatant trick, and it didn’t matter even if Lin Yun had seen through it.

“I can’t keep this going on!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a decisive light because he knew that he couldn’t make it through the first round if defending was all he was going to do.

When the next wave of swordsmen charged at him, Lin Yun stabbed his sword into the ground. The shockwave caused by the impact sent ten swordsmen back as Lin Yun stood with his arms behind his back. Then, he looked at the hundred swordsmen.

“Is this fellow insane?!”

“Is he really not going to draw his sword?”

“Holy shit. Isn’t he too arrogant? I’ve never heard of anyone breaking through the Hundred Ghost Sword Array without using the sword!” This scene instantly made the audiences exclaim and even the likes of Zhao Yan couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

“Don’t…” Bai Ting stood up from his seat when he saw this scene.

“Sit,” said Luo Hua. Her words made Bai Ting hesitate before he ultimately sat down.

“Haha! He’s not going to last!” The Grand Elder of the Feng Clan laughed when he saw this scene. A ferocious light flashed through his pupils as if he already knew that Lin Yun was going to die.

“Hmph!” Feng Xuanzi snorted as he looked at Lin Yun like he was looking at a dead person.

“Hehe!” Feng Xiaoyu couldn’t help grinning when she saw this scene.

At the same time, a jade flute appeared in Lin Yun’s hand as he placed the flute by his lips with his hair fluttering in the wind. At this moment, Lin Yun’s appearance had captivated the hearts of many females.

When the next wave was about to reach him, boundless sword intent exploded out. Lin Yun combined the noble tune and quasi-divine firmament sword intent together and started playing the Dustlight Sword Art.

All the swordsmen who were enveloped by Lin Yun’s sword intent were frozen in place. Furthermore, the music disrupted their array.

As Lin Yun played the flute, his hair fluttered wildly in the wind like an elegant immortal. No one could believe that Lin Yun was suppressing the Hundred Ghost Sword Array with his music. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“This…” Feng Xiaoyu was shocked when he saw this scene.

Lin Yun’s music continued to change as he drew everyone into the intent of his music. It was a beautiful song about flowers.

There was no way that Lin Yun would die if he didn’t use his sword. He was Flower Burial and he wasn’t restricted to only his sword. With a cold light flashing through his pupils, killing intent began to rise in Lin Yun’s heart. Every time his music changed, a swordsman was sent flying. One after another, all the swordsmen were sent flying until they struggled to get back up.

“Kill!” The black-clothed swordsmen were insane as they charged forward without any regard for their lives. Clearly, they wanted to end the challenge by overwhelming Lin Yun with numbers.

But this scene merely enraged Lin Yun as countless crystal flowers flew out of his body, blooming with dazzling light.

In the next second, a hundred swordsmen were sent flying away while their masks shattered. Before a hundred swordsmen could even land on the ground, Lin Yun tied the flute back onto his waist as he reached out with his hand, “Flower Burial!”

As the Flower Burial Sword flew into his hand, Lin Yun knew that there was no need for him to go easy anymore. Since he had already fallen out with the Feng Clan, his benevolence would come back to bite him. With music still playing in the surroundings, Lin Yun fully unleashed the power of the Flower Burial Sword.

His sword aura completely obliterated all the swordsmen. Just like that, he killed a hundred enemies with a swing of his sword.
