Chapter 1161 - Azure Dragon Saint Physique

The entire palace fell silent. Lin Yun didn’t dare to utter a word as he sensed the killing intent in the sect master’s gaze. This old geezer was simply too terrifying, and he could feel that the sect master could kill him with just a glance. He couldn’t even pose any resistance against the sect master.

But Ye Ziling’s expression was calm because she didn’t think that there was anything wrong with admitting that she had a crush on Flower Burial.

As for the sect master, his heart was raging despite the calm and composed look on the surface. He had worked hard to gather the True Dragon Saint Liquid for Lin Yun, and now Lin Yun wanted to sleep with his daughter?! How could he possibly take it lying down?

“Dad, there’s something wrong with your emotions…” Ye Ziling locked her brows together because she could sense the fluctuation in the sect master’s emotions.

“Is there?” The sect master’s lips twitched.

“Is it weird that I’ve fallen for someone? Furthermore, he might not even know about my feelings…” Ye Ziling felt even weirder when she looked at the sect master’s face before she asked, “Dad, why do you have such a huge reaction? It looks like you must know his identity. Introduce him to me when he’s back. I want to thank him personally.”

“Ha. Ha. I naturally know that bastard.” The sect master said with his lips twitching, “I’ll let you know when he comes back.”

“You’re not allowed to scold him! He saved my life, and I also won’t be able to make a breakthrough if it wasn’t for his Nirvana Pellet!” Ye Ziling glared at the sect master.

“How am I scolding him? It’s true that he’s a bastard. Right~ Lin Yun?” The sect master said with a mocking smile.

“Indeed, Flower Burial isn’t someone proper,” replied Lin Yun.

“Lin Yun, what are you talking about?” Ye Ziling glared at Lin Yun furiously.

“Haha, that’s right. Lin Yun, what are you talking about? I’m only saying that Flower Burial is a bastard, not that he’s improper. Come, why don’t you explain how improper this Flower Burial is?” The sect master said with his eyes squinted while stroking his beard. But the chill in his gaze made Lin Yun feel a chill in his spine.

Seeing that the father and daughter were making things difficult for him, Lin Yun couldn’t help crying bitterly. This was caused by Flower Burial, so what did it have to do with him, Lin Yun?! Lin Yun wasn’t someone who would take it lying down. But just when he wanted to flare up, he immediately calmed down because of the cold flicker in the sect master’s gaze.

“Come, explain for us!” The sect master smiled with his eyes squinted.

Looking at the sect master’s gaze, Lin Yun could only make up stories, “He’s been hiding his identity, relying on Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect as a backing to cause troubles. So how can he be someone proper? Furthermore, he might be ugly, which is why he has to wear a mask.”

“Haha. Do you hear that? I didn’t say that.” The sect master laughed.

“Lin Yun, this isn’t the end!” Ye Ziling bit her lips and glared at Lin Yun before she stomped her way out. Seeing this, Lin Yun smiled bitterly but he still felt relieved.

After Ye Ziling left, the sect master’s smile disappeared, “Lin Yun, you’re really bold. I’ve been resolving all the troubles you caused in the Profound Azure Prefecture and you repay me with this? You actually want to bed my daughter?! Are you tired of living?!”

“We haven’t taken that step yet…” Lin Yun immediately explained.

“Do you really think that you would still be alive right now if you took that step?!” The sect master continued to glare at Lin Yun. “Hmph, if I didn’t help you deal with that old geezer from the Heavenly Astral Pavilion, do you think you would still be alive right now?”

The sect master’s words had instantly confirmed Lin Yun’s speculation. He finally knew why that old geezer in the Dragon Pulse Realm didn’t chase him out of the Demon Domain. When he looked into it, later on, he only knew that a sword ray descended from the sky and pinned the guardian of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion onto the building.

Lin Yun had been wondering if it was done by the sect master, and it was now confirmed. At the same time, Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how strong the sect master was to subdue the entire Demon Domain with a sword. Thinking about it, Lin Yun became even more nervous.

“You devoured the origin stone, right?” The sect master looked at Lin Yun before he sneered, “That lass thinks that she can fool the elders, but she can’t fool me!”

“It was a coincidence. I have no idea how I devoured the origin stone when I fell unconscious.” Lin Yun smiled awkwardly.

“It doesn’t matter,” replied the sect master. “Even if you brought it back, I would still give it to you. You’re blessed with fortune. I was troubled on how to help you with the last step, but it seems like you resolved it yourself. Furthermore, it’ll be a lot easier for you because your body was refined by the origin stone.”

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that because he didn’t think that the sect master would be so generous.

“Hmph, I’m not going to cause trouble because you saved my daughter,” snorted the sect master.

Hmph, your daughter would be dead if it wasn’t for me. Lin Yun felt grieved in his heart, but he didn’t dare to speak his thoughts.

“Lichen and I have been discussing opening up the Spirit Astral Mountain. You’ll also go there three days from now to make your breakthrough,” said the sect master.

“I’ll be leaving if there’s nothing else,” replied Lin Yun.

“Scram,” said the sect master.

Feeling relieved, Lin Yun left the sect master’s residence. But when he opened the gates, he saw Ye Ziling staring at him coldly. This made Lin Yun smile awkwardly, “Lady Ye.”

“Call me Senior Sister,” said Ye Ziling coldly. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Senior Sister Ye,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Stop faking it. You clearly know Flower Burial from your conversation with my father. I suggest you spit everything out,” replied Ye Ziling.

Feeling relieved, Lin Yun smiled, “Luo Hua told me about him. You can ask her if you wish to know.”

He couldn’t deal with the sect master, but dealing with Ye Ziling was easy. When Ye Ziling heard about Luo Hua, she didn’t ask anything else and only expressed her doubt, “Are you sure about that?”

“Of course. The Millennium Flame that you drank also came from her. She’s the one who told me about Flower Burial’s identity. Do you think that I would lie to you based on our relationship? Can’t you look at my eyes and see that I’m not lying to you?” Lin Yun replied with an honest expression.

“I’ll believe you this time. Luo Hua… Luo Hua…” Ye Ziling didn’t dare to look Lin Yun in the eyes and stared off with doubt. Then, she started to mutter Luo Hua’s name with killing intent.

After Lin Yun apologized to Luo Hua in his heart, he returned to his residence and pondered about the Spirit Astral Mountain that the sect master told him about. This was the first time he had heard about it, but he guessed that it must be a place similar to the spiritual mountains or spiritual lakes. It wouldn’t be opened normally, and once opened, those who entered would have a great boost to their strength.

“I might be able to save my other treasures if the Spirit Astral Mountain is enough,” muttered Lin Yun. The leaves of the Divine Blood Fruit took a year to grow, and Lin Yun naturally hoped that he could save it for the future when making a breakthrough into the Empyrean Realm.

“I should examine the Azure Dragon Saint Physique first.” Lin Yun collected his thoughts and focused on his physique. Ever since obtaining the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, he had yet to give it a try. When he circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art, a dragon roar echoed from Lin Yun’s body that filled him with power.

The immense power blew his shirt apart, revealing his upper body. He wasn’t especially muscular, but his muscles were lean and defined, containing explosive power. Furthermore, the purple-golden dragon runes were also giving off a metallic luster.

“Azure Dragon Mark!” Lin Yun activated the Azure Dragon Mark and crimson flames bloomed in his heart where the mark was located with an ancient and powerful saint rune. Lin Yun was shocked because the Azure Dragon Mark seemed to have fused with the origin stone perfectly, devouring and refining the saint runes on the origin stone.

When the saint rune blazed, the dragon runes on his body quickly spread out like blood vessels on his body, filling his body with unbelievable power.

Then, Lin Yun made a fist and threw out several punches. Each of his strikes were shining with a metallic luster that swept through his entire residence. Lin Yun was shocked because the purple-golden dragon runes had all turned into saint runes when he activated the Azure Dragon Mark. So he had 108 saint runes, which meant his current physique was comparable to a saint artifact with a hundred saint runes!

Lin Yun’s eyes were blazing with excitement when he discovered that. He had lost the Azure Dragon King’s true bone and a divine rune. Without the divine rune, the power of his Azure Dragon Saint Armor greatly diminished. But now that he had the Blood Flame saint runes, it was a lot easier for him to control the armor. Granted, it still wasn’t the same as the divine rune from the true bone.

He could only bring out 1% or even 0.01% of the power from the divine rune, but at least he could bring out half of the power on the saint runes. He was clearly a lot more powerful than before. The sect master was right, I have a high chance of reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm now.

His physique had undergone a drastic transformation, but now wasn’t the time to feel proud. After all, he wanted to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, and he had to be careful.

“Lin Yun, I heard that you’re back!” Right at this moment, a familiar voice sounded out followed by Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red rushing in. Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because it had been a long time since he saw the two of them. He was also curious how strong Lil’ Red had become after devouring a leaf.
