Chapter 1034 - Vitality Spirits

“Divine Solar Lunar Fist!” Lin Yun looked at the crimson jade slip with a grave but excited look. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t restrain the joy in his eyes. A new path was finally open to him.

Lin Yun’s heart began to throb with excitement and uneasiness. After all, holy spirit marital techniques were known to be perilous. There was a reason why rumors had it that those in the Heavenly Soul Realm experts couldn’t come in contact with a holy spirit martial technique.

Unlike the martial techniques Lin Yun obtained in the past, he wasn’t in a hurry to start cultivating. His sky sword intent had reached greater mastery, which meant that his heart couldn’t be shaken easily. However, it wasn’t easy for him to resist the temptation. Lin Yun closed his eyes as the jade slip hovered before him.

A full hour later, Lin Yun opened his eyes without any fluctuations in his heart. He muttered, “Weird…”

It looked like there was a new barrier to the holy spirit martial technique. Waving his hand, Lin Yun summoned the jade slip and placed it against his forehead. Suddenly, Lin Yun was sent flying as if an invisible force knocked him away.

“This…” Lin Yun’s face changed because he was sure that it was a holy spirit martial technique. He couldn’t understand why an invincible energy was rejecting him.

“It needs vitality. It has a life and you have to feed it,” said Pei Xue. Her eyes shined when she looked at the jade slip because a technique of this level was legendary even in Kunlun Realm. Even in the Profound Amber Realm, a fortune martial technique would be at the top of the pyramid.

Pei Xue came from Kunlun Realm, so she naturally had extraordinary eyesight. She had never seen a holy spirit martial technique before, but she had heard many rumors of them.

“No wonder…” Lin Yun didn’t doubt Pei Xue’s words because he really was tempted to succumb earlier. Looking at Pei Xue, Lin Yun asked, “There aren’t any risks, right?”

“I said it before that a holy spirit martial technique is something that transcends the Heavenly Soul Realm. In Kunlun Realm, many people are sucked dry by holy spirit martial techniques. However, that doesn’t stop others from trying their luck and failing,” replied Pei Xue. She looked at Lin Yun and continued, “But you should be alright. It shouldn’t be difficult for the holy spirit martial technique to acknowledge you.”

“Why is that?”

“After you fainted, god knows how many treasures that damn cat gave you. There were many herbs that I didn’t even recognize. On top of that, there were a few five thousand years old herbs.” Pei Xue muttered while looking at Lin Yun. Lin Yun had no idea how worried she was when he fainted. At this moment, she was blushing, which made her look even more seductive than before.

“I see… so what should I do?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. He clearly had enough vitality to deal with the holy spirit martial technique, but he wasn’t sure how to proceed.

“Go ahead. There shouldn’t be any other requirements,” said Pei Xue.

When Lin Yun heard that, he held onto the jade slip without any hesitation. In the split second he held onto the jade slip, his blood began to boil as his vitality poured into the jade slip. Immediately, Lin Yun’s face turned pale.

Not long later, his lips turned white. There were several times Lin Yun wanted to let go of the jade slip, but he fought to keep going. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Something isn’t right. Pig, let go of it!” Pei Xue’s face suddenly changed when she saw this scene.

“It’s fine. I can still hold on a little longer,” said Lin Yun while he circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art. When he exhausted half of his vitality, a brilliant radiance began to shine from his hand. When he opened his hand, sunlight and moonlight were revealed.

“How mysterious…” Pei Xue was stunned while she looked at the phenomena.

“That’s weird. This holy spirit martial technique has two spirits. The Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix are both divine beasts, but it actually possesses both of them. It must be an extremely powerful technique,” said Pei Xue.

Lin Yun was feeling powerless at this moment, so he swallowed a pellet and circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art. It took a moment to digest, but his face started to regain its color.

“Are holy spirit martial techniques classified into different grades?” Lin Yun asked.

“Of course,” replied Pei Xue. “Holy spirit martial techniques are spiritual, so the biggest difference is the spirits they have. Your technique has the Golden Crow and the Silver Phoenix. They’re both ancient beasts, which is a pro and a con. But you’ll understand it later in the future.”

“Do you have to be that mysterious?” Lin Yun placed the jade slip against his forehead as boundless information started pouring into his forehead. There was so much information that his head felt like it was about to explode. A brief moment later, he removed the jade slip to recover from his dizziness.

“How terrifying… I can only get a rough look at it.” Lin Yun let out a long breath.

“Hmph, I told you that no one can come in contact with holy spirit martial techniques in the Heavenly Soul Realm.” Pei Xue chuckled.

“Indeed.” Lin Yun nodded his head in agreement. At this moment, he finally understood what Pei Xue meant. The Divine Solar Lunar Fist had two spirits, which was rare among holy spirit martial techniques. Clearly, it was powerful. However, it was also a lot harder to cultivate. Then again, the difficulty only applied to those in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

One needed to cultivate the spirit before cultivating the holy spirit martial technique. It was completely different from a fortune martial technique. Cultivating spirits required one to use their vitality to make the spirit look more realistic. Other people only needed to cultivate one spirit, but Lin Yun had to cultivate two powerful spirits. If he couldn’t cultivate the spirits, he wouldn’t be able to start cultivating the holy spirit martial technique.

“Alright, take a break for now. There’s no way you can cultivate this Divine Solar Lunar Fist anytime soon. Maybe you’ll have to wait until you’re at the Saint Spiritual Lake.” Pei Xue came forward to support Lin Yun. However, fearing that he might see the concern in her eyes, she lowered her head when she spoke.

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun asked.

“There’s a high possibility that the Nine Petal Saint Lotus is at the bottom of the lake. It can help you support the cultivation of two spirits,” explained Pei Xue.

“I can’t wait that long.” Lin Yun shook his head as he gently tapped his interspatial pouch to retrieve a bottle of wine.

“What is that?” Pei Xue asked.

“A Millennium Flame,” said Lin Yun in a grave expression.

“The Millennium Flame?!” Pei Xue widened her eyes in disbelief.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun began to chug the Millennium Flame and refine it. His face instantly became rosy as a powerful vitality surged through his body. The wine tasted so good that he couldn’t help but yell, “What great wine!”

As for Pei Xue, she immediately left because she could sense that her clothes were about to catch fire. Lin Yun's vitality was about to boil over.

Then, Lin Yun joined both his hands together and pushed them forward to summon a sun and moon. According to the secret technique recorded in the jade slip, he had to pour his vitality into both spirits.

Because he was cultivating two spirits at the same time, his progress was slow. Even after half a day, Lin Yun only managed to cultivate the spirits to the size of his palm. They looked like two feeble babies. However, they were full of spirituality as they released a cry.
