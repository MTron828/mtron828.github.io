Chapter 1963 - Putting On An Act

Before Lin Yun even came forth, Ye Xin already spoke out with disdain in his pupils.

“Embarrassing? At least I’m much better than a lackey like you,” Lin Yun sneered, looking Ye Xin straight in the eyes. If it weren’t for the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint here, he would’ve killed Ye Xin with a slap. After all, Ye Xin already got on his nerves.

“That’s enough. Step forth,” Bai Shuying said, interrupting the argument between Ye Qingtian and Ye Xin, asking Ye Qingtian to step forth.

“I’m also willing to give it a try!” Ye Xin cupped his hands together. He initially had no intentions to step forth because he definitely couldn’t be compared to the likes of Xiao Jingyan. But since Ye Qingtian went up, why must he be afraid? With Ye Qingtian guaranteed to obtain the worst score, there was nothing Ye Xin had to fear because he was confident that he was stronger than Ye Qingtian.

“Alright,” Bai Shuying said.

“We’ll see. I’ll make you so ashamed and let you know the gap between us!” Ye Xin glared at Ye Qingtian before he stepped forth.

But Lin Yun merely inwardly sneered. It didn’t take long for an empty region to be opened up with ten people standing there. This instantly made the surrounding atmosphere tense, and no one could’ve expected that this small test would be filled with gunpowder.

After all, there was a conflict between Xiao Jingyan and the others. None of the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage cultivators was willing to be convinced by the other party, not to mention the conflict between Ye Qingtian and Ye Xin.

Ye Qingtian really had a fiery temper, and he didn’t cower even when facing Bai Shuying’s intention to embarrass him.

“This is interesting… Ye Xin actually stepped forth as well. He only grasped a word, right?”

“What does he have to be afraid of? I noticed how Ye Qingtian couldn’t even grasp a single word.”

“He probably didn’t even remember the strokes. No matter what, Ye Qingtian is only the champion of the Di Group, and he’s nothing compared to the Tian Group’s saint disciples like us!”

Xiao Jingyan and others began to perform the sword technique as the onlookers discussed amongst themselves. As they brandished their swords, a brush appeared in the air, and they were deciphering ancient words with their sword techniques. The eight swordsmen at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage already had a plan in their hearts as they brandished their sword techniques.

Occasionally, when it wasn’t smooth, they would brandish their swords even more, causing more brush strokes to appear before them.

Compared to them, Ye Xin’s performance was much poorer. His forehead was covered in sweat, and he occasionally sneaked a peek at the others. But this was nothing compared to Ye Qingtian.

Ye Qingtian stood there and didn’t even draw his sword. His brows were furrowed together as he fell into deep thoughts.

“Garbage.” Ye Xin snickered after seeing this, and his confidence was greatly boosted.

“Ye Qingtian, even if you can’t remember a single word, you should at least remember some sword techniques, right? Don’t tell me that you made no preparations?” Bai Shuying said, looking at Lin Yun.

“Relax. Let me think about it,” Lin Yun smiled and closed his eyes.

In just fifteen minutes, Xiao Jingyan’s group of eight brandished their swords with their sword intent boiling around them. Two words also appeared around them; each stroke was golden and enveloped in a faint saint radiance. This instantly amazed everyone who was watching, especially when Xiao Jingyan, Bai Yizhou, and Ye Qinghong managed to write down two words. They were like aloof mountains, far beyond their reach, making them feel unfathomable.

“Holt shit!”

“As expected of successors of the various inheritances. Zhang Kui’s cultivation is the highest, but his performance is a little poor.”

“They’re really fast and are already going to write the last word.”

“The others aren’t slow either, aside from Ye Xin.”

“Hahaha! He just has to stand out against Ye Qingtian. It’s really embarrassing that he can’t even write a single word.”

“Look, Ye Qingtian hasn’t moved either. He probably can’t write anything.” Everyone’s gazes ultimately fell on Ye Qingtian.

After all, Ye Qingtian’s situation was too special, since he never opened his eyes after closing them. On the other hand, Ye Xin was nervous after hearing the surrounding discussions, but he couldn’t help laughing out loud when he turned to look at Ye Qingtian. He inwardly rejoiced that there was a clown like Ye Qingtian here, or he would become a laughingstock.

In the end, Ye Qingtian was a piece of garbage who got lucky to refine a saint origin. But the saint origin was an external item, and it was impossible to rely on the saint origin to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm.

On the contrary, others were already going to write the third word. Fifteen minutes later, everyone stopped, and three ancient words were hovering before them. Then again, this didn’t include Ye Xin because he only wrote down a distorted and crooked word.

Just this alone already covered Ye Xin’s forehead with sweat because it was difficult for him.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint looked at Xiao Jingyan’s group of three and commented, “You guys have grasped 50% of the dao rhythm, and it’s impressive to achieve this in just a stick of incense time.”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Thank you, Martial Aunt!” Xiao Jingyan’s group of three wore smug faces and cupped their hands together.

As for the others, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint commented that they grasped 30% of the dao rhythm.

“As for you…” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint looked at Ye Xin’s word and didn’t know how to comment on it. Everyone in the surroundings was bearing their laughter because Ye Xin was really embarrassed. A long silence later, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, “I can’t recognize what you wrote.”

Finally, everyone couldn’t hold back it back any longer and burst into laughter. The surrounding peals of laughter made Ye Xin’s face turn red with regret. He wouldn’t have stepped forth if he knew it would be so embarrassing. But after Ye Xin cupped his hands together, he turned to Ye Qingtian, who was still closing his eyes, and roared, “Ye Qingtian, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint has already started to judge. So where are yours?”

When Lin Yun finally opened his eyes, he looked at Bai Shuying and smiled, “I can’t remember the sword techniques, but I can remember some of the brush strokes. Can I write them down in the form of calligraphy?”

“Brush.”

Bai Shuying wanted to say something, but she was interrupted by the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

After a brush was brought to Lin Yun, he fell into deep thoughts as he bit on the tip of the brush.

“That fellow really knows how to act. He’s really an amateur, and he’ll be exposed this time.”

“He doesn’t know that the martial aunt's words contain saint dao and dao rhythm. It cannot be replicated with a brush and has to be deciphered through sword techniques.”

“Without the dao rhythm and intent, it’s impossible for anyone to replicate the words.”

As discussions came from the surroundings, Lin Yun felt that they were all putting on airs. In the end, Bai Shuying said, “Ye Qingtian, go down if you really can’t do it.”

“I share a different thought,” Lin Yun smiled. When everyone felt that Ye Qingtian was putting on an act, he finally moved. He took a deep breath and began to write.

It might be impossible for others, but that wasn’t an issue for Lin Yun. Back in the Sword Sect, the Radiant Sword Saint taught him calligraphy and even demonstrated his calligraphy with the Carefree 9 Swords.

It wasn’t tricky for Lin Yun, but he couldn’t determine the flaw in the three words. But he didn’t have the time to think and was forced to write something. So he decided to write down the three words first.

A brief moment later, afterimages appeared around Lin Yun, and they began to practice various sword techniques when Lin Yun moved his brush, and the ancient dao rhythm in the words were being replicated. Whenever Lin Yun wrote something down, each brush stroke seemed as though it would exist for eternity.

This instantly shocked everyone with disbelief on their faces, and they couldn’t believe that Ye Qingtian really wrote it out. They could clearly see the intent and dao rhythm as though time had reversed and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was writing them down.

“H-How is this possible?!” Ye Xin was dumbfounded. As for Xiao Jingyan’s group of three, they were also perplexed, with doubts on their faces.

On the other hand, Lin Yun didn’t find it weird, since this was the basic skill of Radiant Sword Saint’s disciples. He could only say that these saint disciples were too ignorant.

When Lin Yun finished writing three words, he suddenly laughed just when he was going to stop, “Hahaha! I finally understand now!”

His laughter made everyone jump, wondering if Ye Qingtian had gone insane.

“Martial Aunt is really naughty to deliberately leave out a word. It’s no wonder why something didn’t feel right about the three words,” Lin Yun muttered, and his words made everyone’s jaws drop.

But when Lin Yun wrote down the fourth word, a dazzling golden radiance shone out, and the words written by Xiao Jingyan and others dissolved like melting snow. But what was more shocking was that everyone could recognize the four words, “Top of the sky!”

This was a weird feeling. Everyone couldn’t recognize those four words, but they would understand the meaning of it. At this moment, even a fool could tell that Ye Qingtian was right, and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint deliberately left a word out.

But strangely, everyone’s words disappeared except for Ye Xin’s. His words were like a soundless mockery in front of the words written by Lin Yun. At this moment, everyone finally understood why the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint couldn’t understand what Ye Xin wrote. It turned out that Ye Xin randomly wrote down nonsense.

This scene made the corners of Ye Qinghong’s lips twitch, and he couldn’t help feeling embarrassed.

Ye Xin’s face turned red, and he felt so ashamed that he wanted to find a hole to hide himself in it. He wrote down nonsense by mimicking others in the process, thus coming up with that ugly word.

He previously mocked that he had Ye Qingtian to cover for him and wasn’t afraid of embarrassing himself. But in reality, he never expected he was the clown in the process. This instantly made Ye Xin furious as he roared, “Ye Qingtian, you’re shameless! Didn’t you say that you didn’t know?”

“Sorry about it, but I was putting on an act,” Lin Yun smiled.
