Chapter 1615 - No Longer Enduring It!

The battle between Lin Yun and the demonic corpses had caused considerable commotion, and the radiance of the Sovereign Saint Artifact attracted many people’s attention. As thunderclouds rumbled, bolts of lightning streaked across the horizon, simultaneously making everyone feel afraid and excited.

“What’s going on?”

“What a terrifying pressure. Is this a sign that a treasure is about to be born?”

“That saint artifact’s power is too terrifying. I’ve never seen something like that in the Ancient Barren Battlefield!” All the experts who had gathered on the mountain looked at the summit with curiosity and grave expressions. Their eyes were flickering, and they were curious about what had happened at the mountain's summit.

After all, anyone who could make it here wasn’t weak, and most of them were at the pinnacle third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. There were even some at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Just when everyone felt uncertain, a figure flew past their heads like a dazzling sun.

“Someone’s here!” Everyone exclaimed and raised their heads to see a person carrying a sword box, and the sun made that person look like a deity. Before everyone could take a closer look at that person, three people flew past, chasing after the first person.

“That’s Chen Tao of the Emerald Jade Manor!”

“That’s the Vajra Monastery’s Xuan Feng!”

“There’s Xiao Kui of the Heavenly Blade Pavilion, as well!” Everyone’s faces changed with shock upon seeing the appearance of the three. The eight powerful sects’ were prominent in the Ancient Barren Domain, and the appearance of a chief disciple would cause a huge commotion. So how could they not be shocked when three powerful sects’ chief disciples appeared simultaneously? This also made them wonder what happened at the mountain’s summit.

“Who’s that grey-clothed swordsman?”

“This is weird. Can it be that that swordsman took the treasure that was on the mountain? He’s really arrogant to dare to face three chief disciples!” Everyone was shocked. The powerful sects could be considered taboo in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and no one was willing to offend them.

The Ancient Barren Battlefield had all the elites in the Ancient Barren Domain gathered, but everyone knew that the true overlords were the eight powerful sects. As for the other forces, none of them dared to face the eight powerful sects, no matter how arrogant they were.

“Lin Yun, hand over the saint sword, and we’ll spare your life!”

“You dare to leave after obtaining the Sovereign Saint Sword? Do you think that the three of us don’t exist?!” When everyone felt doubtful, a rumbling voice echoed, containing cold killing intent.

The three chief disciples were enveloped in torrential killing intents that soared to the sky along with their boiling vitalities and boundless dragon origins. Facing this terrifying pressure, no one dared to look at them head-on.

But they were first stumped before their faces changed. They couldn’t believe what they had just heard; there was a Sovereign Saint Artifact at the mountain's summit.

Lin Yun stopped after he arrived at the foot of the mountain. Three auras were chasing after him, and more disciples from the three sects were gathering from afar. The three of them were starting to get on his nerves.

They fled earlier, then chased after him when the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit died. It’s no wonder why they were at the top of the pyramid amongst the Golden Generation. Those people had already gotten on his nerves when they suddenly made a move against him, but they were fortunate that they quickly fled. And yet, they dared to show up after the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit died. Did they think that he was afraid of them?

When he turned around, his gaze was cold and filled with a killing aura. His hair began to flutter in the wind, and he emitted a radiance while facing the three who caught up to him.

“Ha, you’re afraid now?” Chen Tao’s eyes flashed with mockery when he saw Lin Yun stop.

“Hand over the Sovereign Saint Sword!” Xiao Kui was direct with his words.

“Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, let me see what you can do in this position!” Xuan Feng said.

The three separated and hovered in the sky while releasing a massive aura that sealed off this entire region. This was terrifying, and time seemed to have stopped under the three’s pressure. Their auras also made the sword ray on Lin Yun dim down.

“One against three?” Lin Yun smiled as his killing intent began to brew.

“You’re overthinking it. There’s no need for all three of us to deal with you. We’re only preventing you from escaping. Just one of us is enough to deal with you!” Chen Tao snickered.

“The Heavenly Blade Pavilion and Sword Sect have a good relationship with each other. For Gu Ruochen’s sake, I won’t make things difficult for you. Hand over the Sovereign Saint Sword, and you can leave. I won’t take advantage of you. I can even give you a myriad year saint elixir as compensation.” Xiao Kui said. He was indifferent, and he also seemed irritated. After all, the Nether Saint Sword was obtained by Lin Yun right before their eyes, and this matter even caused a huge fuss, attracting the attention of the entire mountain.

There were thousands to tens of thousands of people here, which naturally made him feel embarrassed to gang up on Lin Yun. But he couldn’t be bothered about that right now. Lin Yun had to hand over the Sovereign Saint Artifact, regardless of whether he liked it or not. This was the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and one’s face was worth nothing.

“A saint elixir for a Sovereign Saint Artifact?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with mockery. “And yet you dare to say that you’re not taking advantage of me? You want me to hand over a Sovereign Saint Artifact? Don’t even dream about it without a hundred saint elixirs.”

Lin Yun’s words changed Chen Tao, Xiao Kui, and Xuan Feng’s faces.

“Hmph!” Chen Tao snorted. “Don’t take it too far. Let me, Chen Tao, the chief disciple of the Emerald Jade Manor, see what ability the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple has!”

He was determined to obtain the Sovereign Saint Artifact, so he immediately brought out his Glazed Treasure Physique. As his body began to glow, the clouds in the sky started to rumble as he charged at Lin Yun. When he got close, he threw a punch that contained a terrifying power. His punch contained pure power that looked like a bright star.

“You’re courting death!” Lin Yun didn’t give him any face and threw his punch out. He also made use of the Blue Dragon Bone, unleashing a purple-golden light that soared to the sky when he brought out the full power of his Azure Dragon Saint Physique. His punch was like an azure dragon containing a boundless dragon aura that swept out, causing heaven and earth to tremble.

When their punches collided, it created a massive shockwave. Circulating the Azure Dragon Saint Art, Lin Yun’s boundless vitality filled his body, and it multiplied through the empowerment of the Blue Dragon Bone. His bones crackled, and his muscles swelled with his eyes filled with golden light. It was as though his vitality was about to blow him apart. Upon reaching the limit, Lin Yun let out a roar that sounded like a divine dragon.

On the other hand, Chen Tao took ten-odd steps back with a fine crack on his palm that looked like cracked porcelain. He even had blood dripping down from his lip as he looked at Lin Yun in shock.

“How dare you act with such impudence since you know my identity. Today, I’ll teach you a lesson on behalf of your sect’s elders. This Radiant Sword Saint still decides the Ancient Barren Domain’s fate. A mere chief disciple of the Emerald Jade Manor like you dares to stand before me?” Lin Yun roared, and everyone in the mountain could hear his words. When they raised their heads to look at Lin Yun, they could no longer contain their shock.

Was this the grace of Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple? Lin Yun rarely called himself the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, but since he could no longer endure it, there was no need for him to keep enduring it, then. These three people kept saying that the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple wasn’t qualified to speak with them.

Not only did they belittle him, but they even looked down on the Radiant Sword Saint. They probably wouldn’t even dare to let out a fart if he was a disciple of the Profound Sky Sect. Today, he would let these people know who made the decisions in the Ancient Barren Domain!

When Chen Tao heard what Lin Yun said, his face became green, and he roared, “So what if you’re the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple?”

The two clashed once more, one using his Glazed Treasure Physique and the other using his Azure Dragon Saint Physique, empowered by the Blue Dragon Bone. Whenever they attacked, each strike would unleash a terrifying radiance that would tear the demonic clouds apart.

The two had terrifying physiques. They were like two ancient beasts when they clashed. Ultimately, their vitalities were like boiling magma oceans, and the shockwaves from their intense collision made it challenging for others to bear. Some people began to bleed from their seven orifices under the shockwaves, with their faces becoming pale.

“Azure Dragon Grasp!”

“Divine Phaseless Monument!”

The two unleashed their ultimate moves, circulating their vitalities and physiques to an unbelievable height. The phenomena created by their attacks were shocking as an Azure Dragon and a jade tablet collided.

The two were evenly matched, but Lin Yun’s attack was more long-lasting because the Blue Dragon Bone could keep producing dragon runes. In the end, Chen Tao finally couldn’t hold on any longer and threw out a mouthful of blood while he retreated.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

As Lin Yun let out a roar, his hair fluttered in the wind with golden light shining from his pupils. The Azure Dragon in the sky also let out a roar. This Azure Dragon was condensed with forty-thousand dragon runes and Lin Yun was standing on it while chasing after Chen Tao.

This scene startled many people, but they all had a thought, who could compete with the current Lin Yun? The Azure Dragon was fast. When Lin Yun fused his sword aura into the Azure Dragon, it manifested into an Azure Dragon Sword Aura that shot out like a sword.

This scene left Xuan Feng and Xiao Kui stumped. Was this the power someone at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm was supposed to possess?
