Chapter 2472 - A Smile

The Golden Emperor Physique was tempered through the Emperor Tribulation, known to be indestructible. Then again, the strength of each Golden Emperor Physique was different, like how the Radiant Sword Emperor’s Golden Emperor Physique was comparable to the Nine Emperors.

The Emperors of the three holy lands were the weakest. The Ice Emperor wasn’t a mythical emperor, but he was stronger than the emperors of the three holy lands. This meant that his Golden Emperor Physique wasn’t weak.

Lin Yun looked at the other party with an uncertain expression. Sensing the pressure from someone in the Emperor Realm, Lin Yun’s body began to tremble, looking nervous. But he was also excited with his fighting spirits blazing.

“Let’s go!” The Ice Emperor stretched his body and charged over. The sky was enveloped in lightning, with thunderclouds appearing. This was the phenomenon of the Golden Emperor Physique, faintly showing the reappearance of the Emperor Tribulation.

When the Ice Emperor got close, he threw out an ordinary punch. Space began to crack with dazzling lightning flashing around in the sky. This caused Lin Yun’s face changed because he didn’t expect an Emperor's pressure to be so powerful.

Before thinking more about it, he arced his body with his spine protruding and the Heavenly Dragon Bone appearing, releasing the Heavenly Dragon’s aura. Along with a dragon’s roar, a terrifying phenomenon also appeared on Lin Yun, containing the prestige of the lord of all dragons, which even caused Ice Emperor’s aura to tremble.

The Ice Emperor frowned and discovered that his punch faced great hindrance and slowed down his speed.

Lin Yun took this opportunity to push his palm forward. The impact of the Golden Emperor Realm forced Lin Yun to retreat, leaving behind a huge mark on the ground. Along with the Heavenly Dragon’s roar, Lin Yun stabilized his body and took this fist head-on.

“He blocked it!” An exclamation came from the surroundings as everyone looked at Lin Yun with shock.

The Radiant Sword Emperor heaved in relief because everyone knew what this punch meant. Lin Yun could confront someone in the Emperor Realm with cultivation in the Boundless Stage of the Great Saint Realm. The fact that Lin Yun climbed the summit of that mountain meant that he had strength comparable to that of emperors, and it was further proven when he could take a punch from the Ice Emperor.

“Not bad!” The Ice Emperor’s eyes shone, and he smiled, “I won’t hold back then.”

“My pleasure!” Lin Yun smiled. The two clashed, and the Ice Emperor no longer held back. When the Ice Emperor attacked, the phenomenon he created was terrifying. He also held the upper hand in the battle, but Lin Yun’s defenses were flawless.

When they clashed, the remnant energy of the Heavenly Dragon Bone was swiftly being refined, turning into energy to push his cultivation to the Immortal Stage, shaking his bottleneck.

“Too slow! Senior, can you speed up?” Sensing the energy surging in his body, Lin Yun smiled, “Let me experience the Golden Emperor Physique.”

Lin Yun moved, reaching out, and claw marks appeared in space. His hand was like a dragon’s claw that even shocked the Ice Emperor because this was the first time Lin Yun retaliated.

“Come again!” Lin Yun laughed. His spine was the Heavenly Dragon Bone, and a power surge poured into his palm, allowing him to turn the tables around and force the Ice Emperor to take a few steps back.

Just when the Ice Emperor was shocked, an even more terrifying aura swept out from Lin Yun. As violent energy coursed through his body, Lin Yun roared, and his cultivation reached the Immortal Stage of the Great Saint Realm. This was the last stage of the Great Saint Realm.

When golden radiance shone from Lin Yun, someone held onto the light particle and exclaimed, “That’s dragon origin!”

“He finally refined the Heavenly Dragon Bone.”

“He has already reached the pinnacle of the Great Saint Realm.” The Sword Saints that fought with Lin Yun before looked at him with disbelief.

The Ice Emperor didn’t have the luxury of time to be shocked because Lin Yun already charged over, releasing a golden radiance, becoming chilling gold. Under the full power of the Golden Emperor Physique, this sent Lin Yun flying away, but Lin Yun managed to stabilize himself with a somersault.

“This is the pinnacle Golden Emperor Physique?” Lin Yun looked with his eyes flashing.

The Ice Emperor sighed, “Maybe. I didn’t expect you to force me to this step so quickly, not to mention that you hadn’t brought out your full power.”

Lin Yun merely smiled because he didn’t use his full strength with the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique. The Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique even had a secret technique to summon the Ancient Heavenly Dragon to possess him.

“You have to watch out now,” the Ice Emperor said. “The true profundity in the Golden Emperor Physique lies in comprehending Heavenly Dao’s might during the tribulation.”

As soon as he said that, he appeared before Lin Yun, throwing a punch forward. There wasn’t any profundity in this move, and was merely using the Heavenly Dao’s might.

When the punch appeared before Lin Yun, he could hear a buzzing sound in his ears that sounded like the Heavenly Dao’s roar.

Taking this punch, Lin Yun felt the Heavenly Dao’s might when the Ice Emperor underwent his tribulation, and it felt like he was the one undergoing it. This was weird, which was why the Golden Emperor Physique was terrifying.

Ten moves later, Lin Yun was forced to retreat, and the phenomenon of the Heavenly Dao left behind cracks in the ground. This made the Dao Suspend Sword Saint’s lips twitch because Emperors had never fought on this stage before.

“Sect master, the plaza seems to be on the verge of collapsing,” Chu Liang said anxiously.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint forced a smile, “It’s fine. The plaza has a spiritual array of divine runs beneath, and it will repair itself.”

But those words didn’t alleviate Chu Liang’s anxiety because the battle between the Ice Emperor and Lin Yun grew even more terrifying. He muttered, “Can he withstand it...?”

“Azure Dragon, aid me!” Lin Yun roared as his voice was like an order, causing the Azure Dragon Constellation to descend from beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven.

Lin Yun stood on the Azure Dragon’s head, and the azure dragon left behind claw marks in space when it swung its claw. Under the power of the Azure Dragon Constellation, the Heavenly Dao’s might was blocked, and such a powerful Sovereign Constellation was easily controlled by Lin Yun.

The Ice Emperor didn’t expect this from Lin Yun.

“This is the Sovereign Constellation...” The Ice Emperor said in a helpless tone.

“Not exactly. This is the Heavenly Dragon’s authority, the power of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique. I am the Heavenly Dragon, and I’m the lord of all dragons!” Lin Yun smiled. He charged toward the Ice Emperor as he laughed, creating a shocking commotion. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Taking the punch head-on, cracks began to appear on the golden radiance around him, and he was forced to take a few steps back.

“Disperse!” The Azure Dragon dissolved, and Lin Yun passed through it, charging towards the Ice Emperor.

When the Ice Emperor landed on the ground, he had to use his full strength to face the incoming punch. This was the strongest punch from the Golden Emperor Physique as various phenomena from an Emperor’s tribulation began to fall on Lin Yun.

If it’s the Ice Emperor’s tribulation, it should be able to withstand it with my Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique. Lin Yun analyzed. But it would be another question if it was his master’s tribulation.

When the time for the Heavenly Dao’s might expired, the Ice Emperor was sent flying away. The golden radiance he gave off shattered with blood dripping on his lips when he landed on the ground.

This made the Ice Emperor look at Lin Yun with shock. He and all the swordsmen present were also stumped because Lin Yun relied on the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique to withstand the Ice Emperor’s Golden Emperor Physique.

The Ice Emperor came to his senses and sighed, “Flower Burial, you can withstand my Emperor’s tribulation with your current strength.”

This meant that Lin Yun could reach the Emperor Realm if he wanted.

Lin Yun smiled, “Maybe. Since we’re done competing with our physiques, why don’t we use a move to end this fight? Let’s both use a sword.”

The Ice Emperor sighed because he could tell Lin Yun was trying to save him from embarrassment. After all, earlier, he lost terribly in the confrontation between the Golden Emperor Physique and Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique.

“This sword is the strongest martial technique of the Frostsnow Sacred Palace, Eternal Frost!” A chill flashed in the Ice Emperor’s eyes as he formed a seal and flicked his finger, unleashing an ice sword that froze the space it passed through, wiping everything in its path and covering the plaza in a layer of ice.

“Retreat!” All the swordsmen’s faces changed when the chill spread out and quickly retreated. When they raised their heads in shock, they could see that even the clouds were frozen by this chill, including the invisible wind that was frozen into various shapes.

“Holy shit, this is really beautiful!” Even Lil’ Purple couldn’t help praising because this was one of her strongest attacks in her prime.

But something unimaginable appeared before Lin Yun raised his head with a smile, bringing out the fusion of heaven and sword. When his sword heart bloomed, the ice sword began to shatter along with all the ice.

This forced the Ice Emperor down on one knee with blood dripping from his lips, and he looked at Lin Yun in disbelief. Everyone else couldn’t see the profundity of this move, and only the Radiant Sword Emperor nodded.

Half a month from now, Lin Yun finally has the qualifications to fight the Empress.
