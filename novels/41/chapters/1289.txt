Chapter 1290 - Clues

Lin Yun was the only one left standing on the battlefield. All of the disciples of the Flame Dragon Sect have died without an exception. The entire battlefield was left in a tattered state with terrifying craters on the ground and a pile of corpses from the Flame Dragon Sect.

Lin Yun was riding on an azure dragon, and the azure dragon was shining with purple-golden light while being enveloped in a terrifying dragon aura. At the same time, Lin Yun also had a pair of golden wings on his back that shone brightly.

As the azure dragon released a ferocious roar, Bai Luli, who had his constellation torn apart, was still running for his life with a pale face.

“Damn it, why is he so strong?!” Bai Luli had blood dripping from his lips with panic on his face. He didn’t look like a transcendent genius at this moment. This scene was so shocking that it left a huge impact on the audience members.

On the azure dragon, Lin Yun, who took a brief rest, took in a deep breath before he soared into the sky. When the pair of wings flapped behind him, he appeared before Bai Luli in the blink of an eye.

“You…” Bai Luli was shocked because he never expected that Lin Yun would be so fast.

But Lin Yun didn’t waste any time with him and raised his hand. As the dragon runes gathered on his palm, his hand manifested into a dragon claw that struck Bai Luli’s head. But when his hand landed on Bai Luli’s head, a dazzling light shone and Lin Yun was shocked to see that Bai Luli was still alive.

At that moment, an ancient saint armor had appeared on Bai Luli’s body. The armor had formed into a flaming membrane with saint runes engraved on it, perfectly enveloping Bai Luli’s head.

“I have a saint armor, so there’s no way you can kill me!” Bai Luli snickered. As long as Lin Yun couldn’t kill him, he had ways to take revenge. With his face was dark, he gritted his teeth. “I’ll definitely repay the humiliation I received today!”

“Saint armor?” But Lin Yun didn’t even think much about it and pushed the Azure Dragon Saint Art to the limit. In just one breath’s time, he had unleashed over a hundred punches on Bai Luli’s chest. Whenever his punch landed on Bai Luli’s chest, the dragon runes that made contact would erupt like a volcano.

A thousand punches later, Lin Yun had shattered all of Bai Luli’s bones. Every one of his punches was like a huge dragon that tackled Bai Luli. Even if Bai Luli was wearing some saint armor, his body was still nearly destroyed from Lin Yun’s punches.

“Stop!” Bai Luli finally panicked.

“You dare call yourself a transcendent with just this much? You’re nothing but a piece of garbage.” Lin Yun said before he threw out another punch with all his sword intent poured into this attack. His attack had quickly shattered Bai Luli’s saint armor. After the saint armor broke, Bai Luli’s body also broke into pieces. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But when Bai Luli’s body broke into pieces, his body then manifested into five flaming jiao-dragons that escaped in five different directions.

“What?” Lin Yun was so surprised by this scene that even his thoughts had briefly paused. This was the first time he had seen something so bizarre. With five flaming jiao-dragons, this would easily confuse others.

But Lin Yun could sense that the aura from the five jiao-dragons was weak, and the price of executing this secret technique must be high. When Lin Yun recovered from his shock, the five jiao-dragons had already fled and it was already too late for him to chase after them.

Lin Yun briefly pondered before he gave up chasing them. His objective wasn’t to kill, and it was also natural for the Chief Disciple of a big sect to have means to ensure his safety. If he chased after Bai Luli now, he might run into danger, and his actions might alarm the Elysium Core Realm experts from the big sects.

“How did things turn out this way?” The audience members nearly went insane because they couldn’t believe that a transcendent genius was actually forced to execute such a secret technique. There was no question that Bai Luli was strong, and he was only secondary to those in the strongest tier. If he had more time, he might even be able to catch up to those geniuses. But he had suffered such a terrible loss in Lin Yun’s hands.

“Time to check my harvest.” Lin Yun sent the azure dragon back to his body, then gathered all the interspatial pouches that were left behind. Then, he arrived at the Ancient Spiritual Lake and sat down before he began to refine it to deminish his exhaustion from the battle.

The spiritual lake was clear and filled with rainbow light. This was a rare treasured place, but the most important factor was the Divine Astral Pellets at the bottom of the lake. That was the reason why Lin Yun couldn’t contain his excitement.

Half an hour later, when Lin Yun reopened his eyes, a terrifying light flashed across his pupils. The aura he was emitting was terrifying, and he was also enveloped in a faint luster that made him look like a deity.

“What a pity.” But Lin Yun let out a sigh because the Divine Astral Pellets that shot out from the lake were destroyed from the previous battle, and there were only a hundred thousand of them left. This was why Lin Yun felt so much heartache for his loss.

Circulating the Iris Sword Sutra once more, a silver iris flower appeared on the surface of the lake. Without any disturbance now, Lin Yun could circulate the sword sutra without any reservation. Not long later, beams of light began to shoot out from the spiritual lake with countless Divine Astral Pellets, and it didn’t take long for the surroundings to be filled with an astronomical sum of Divine Astral Pellets.

“Oh my god!”

“Just how many Divine Astral Pellets are there?!”

“Bai Luli was really lucky to find this place, and it’s no wonder that anyone who tried to enter was killed.”

“This luck is heaven-defying!” The audience members who remained had disbelief in their eyes. The number of Divine Astral Pellets was close to a million. This was an unimaginable sum, and they couldn’t help exclaiming Bai Luli’s luck. Alas, the Divine Astral Pellets now belonged to Lin Yun. It didn’t matter how lucky Bai Luli was since all of it was Lin Yun’s now.

When everyone fell into silence, many of them had greed flashing in their pupils. But no one dared to make a move, especially after Lin Yun had just butchered all the disciples of the Flame Dragon Sect and even defeated Bai Luli.

An hour later, a terrifying aura exploded from the bottom of the lake and Lin Yun opened his eyes. In that split second, the mysterious expert at the bottom of the lake had suddenly revealed an eerie and destructive aura that suddenly alarmed him.

At the same time, he also recalled something. That mysterious expert’s corpse was only preserved thanks to this place. He had a terrifying power contained within his body, and if it explodes, the aftermath would be unimaginable.

“Let’s forget about it, then.” Lin Yun knew his motive well, and he didn’t take such a big risk just because of Divine Astral Pellets. When he waved his hand, the astronomical sum of Divine Astral Pellets in the sky were kept in his interspatial pouch. “This should be at least two million Divine Astral Pellets…”

Lin Yun squinted his eyes with a smile. Compared to when had obtained nothing when he first entered the Profound Wither Island, he had a huge harvest this time. After all, those transcendent geniuses even found origin saint runes, and even the big sect disciples also had decent harvests. So he was the only one who was empty-handed till now.

But his luck had now turned for the better. At the same time, Lin Yun knew that he couldn’t stay here for long. If he stayed here and the news spread out, it would definitely attract a large number of Elysium Core Realm experts, and it would be troublesome at that time. Before reaching the Elysium Core Realm, Lin Yun didn’t want to face those Greater Elysium Core Realm experts.

“There’s a seal here. This might be a fortune, but I should remember not to force it or the consequences will be dire,” said Lin Yun before he executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformation and disappeared. Before the Ancient Spiritual Lake disappeared from his sight, he even turned back to take a look and could see countless people flocking over to the Ancient Spiritual Lake.

This made Lin Yun shake his head because there was nothing he could do if those people didn’t want to heed his advice.

Four hours later, Lin Yun was already a few myriad miles away. Along the way, he landed on a mountain when he sensed Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red’s aura. When two streaks of light flew over, it didn’t take long for Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red to appear before Lin Yun.

“It’s not that you’re unlucky, but the Profound Wither Island is just too big…” Lil’ Purple said after listening to Lin Yun’s experience. After all, those powerful sects were only able to find what they wanted because their sects had a long inheritance, and some of them even had ancient maps of the Profound Wither Island. So, logically speaking, those transcendent geniuses didn’t rely on themselves to find the origin saint runes.

“I see…” Now that he thought it over, there was a possibility that Bai Luli didn’t chance upon the Ancient Spiritual Lake by luck. His sect might not have any news about origin saint runes, but they might have information about some ruins and fortunes.

“How many Divine Astral Pellets are you still lacking?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Three million,” said Lin Yun. When he said that, the joy of obtaining two million Divine Astral Pellets died down.

“That won’t do. If you can’t reach the Elysium Core Realm, you won’t be able to compete with those transcendent geniuses. You must know that they will have imprinted an origin saint rune on their elysium core when they made their breakthrough, and this means that they’re a lot stronger than before they entered the Profound Wither Island,” said Lil’ Purple.

“No chance at all?” Lin Yun locked his brows together.

“You think I’ll bluff you?” Lil’ Purple then continued, “Perhaps there’s a place where you can find the remaining three million Divine Astral Pellets.”

“Where?” Lin Yun asked with his eyes lighting up.
