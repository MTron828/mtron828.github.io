Chapter 575 - Winner, Lin Yun

Cao Zhen’s aura dwindled as he vomited blood. No matter how hard he tried moving the Flower Burial Sword, he couldn’t pull it out. At the same time, Lin Yun also collapsed on the ground.

Everyone could still hear Lin Yun’s hoarse roar echoing in their ears. Shortly after, everyone exclaimed as they watched the scene unfold before them. No one could have imagined that Lin Yun would actually turn the tables.

They initially thought that the battle had ended when Lin Yun was falling, so no one had expected that Lin Yun would suddenly call for his sword and send Cao Zhen flying away. Although Lin Yun had fainted, Cao Zhen was pinned to the ground by the Flower Burial Sword. It was clear who had won.

Furthermore, no one had expected that the fight between Lin Yun and Cao Zhen would be so brutal. After all, the outcome of their battle was only determined at the final moment. Both Lin Yun and Cao Zhen ahd proved that they were ruthless. They weren’t only ruthless to their opponents, but also to themselves.

Cao Zhen was relying on his willpower to stand up after being hit by Lin Yun Seven Slaughtering Fist. His terrifying willpower convinced everyone that he had won. But Lin Yun wouldn’t let that happen.

In the end, Lin Yun had won. This left everyone from the Violethut Academy dumbfounded, especially the elder leading the team. His jaw dropped in disbelief that the Violethut Academy actually lost.

“So what if we leave it with trash like you? We’ll just take it away in two decades.” Those were the arrogant words they said twenty years ago. It had finally come back to slap them in the face.

While everyone slowly digested the scene, two figures charged out from the Heavenly Province Academy’s party. They were naturally Mo Ling and Liu Yunyan. Their faces changed when they saw Lin Yun lying in the ruins. Although they already saw Lin Yun covered in blood, their faces still changed when they saw his wounds.

Mo Ling placed her hand on Lin Yun’s wrist. When she sensed the cold origin energy within Lin Yun’s body, her expression gradually became grave. This made Liu Yunyan worried. But a brief moment later, Mo Ling smiled as she relaxed her expression, “He can still be saved. Help me out.”

Liu Yunyan let out a breath of relief as she quickly picked Lin Yun up while Mo Ling retrieved a red pellet from a jade bottle. Then, Mo Ling placed the pellet inside Lin Yun’s mouth. The pellet melted the instant it entered Lin Yun’s mouth and a warm current coursed throughout Lin Yun’s meridians. As time passed, Liu Yunyan could sense Lin Yun’s body temperature warming up.

“Lin Yun didn’t disperse the chilling origin energy from Cao Zhen’s attack. Otherwise, his internal injuries wouldn’t be so serious,” said Mo Ling. “But he should be fine now after taking the pellet. He can recover by himself with his powerful physique.”

Although Lin Yun’s injuries had stabilized, Mo Ling and Liu Yunyan still wore grave expressions. They understood how tough the fight with Cao Zhen was.

“Winner, Lin Yun! The Heavenly Province Academy succeeded in the challenge and is the champion of this competition!” At this moment, a familiar voice sounded out. Then, everyone narrowed their eyes and turned to look at Cao Zhen who was still pinned to the ground.

The sword was still plunged into Cao Zhen’s body and they could sense the fighting spirits coming from it. No matter what Cao Zhen did, he wasn’t able to pull it out of his body.

“Damn it!” Cao Zhen helplessly released his grip on the sword. When he tried to raise his head and look at his opponent who defeated him, he could see that Lin Yun was being carried by a woman while another woman cared for him. He had an impression of both of them. After all, they were pretty famous in the Nether Prefecture, not to mention that Mo Ling was on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

As for the VIolethut Academy, they were overcome with bitter pain and they couldn’t be bothered with Cao Zhen right now. Cao Zhen knew at this moment that he had lost as he laid on the ground and looked at the clouds.

When everyone looked at Cao Zhen’s bleak appearance, they felt emotional. Who would’ve thought that Cao Zhen would be defeated by a nobody? Although, that nobody had challenged Hell Mode and defeated the four contenders.

Everyone in the Ancient Southern Domain had already considered Cao Zhen to be a strong competitor for the Dragoncloud Ranking. But he was defeated by Lin Yun who was only eighteen. In the end, he became Lin Yun’s stepping stone. Without a doubt, Lin Yun’s fame would spread throughout the Nether Prefecture and maybe even the Ancient Southern Domain.

Lin Yun coughed as he awoke in Liu Yunyan’s embrace. He opened his eyes with great difficulty to see both Liu Yunyan and Mo Ling.

“You’re up!” Liu Yunyan rejoiced while Mo Ling reacted rather calmly. She had already examined Lin Yun’s injuries, so she knew that Lin Yun would be fine after suppressing the chilling saber energy within his body.

“Help me up…” smiled Lin Yu.

As the two ladies helped him up, Lin Yun was emotional. He turned to look at the Flower Burial Sword that pinned Cao Zhen down. He slowly walked towards Cao Zhen. Back then, when he grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword, there were many scenes that flashed through his mind. However, he ultimately remembered the azure-clothed man from the rose painting.

At that moment, he could sense that he seemed to have fused with the azure-clothed man, which was why his sword was so terrifying. So he was surprised that Cao Zhen actually managed to protect his vital spot and survived the attack.

“You won,” said Cao Zhen powerlessly as he looked at Lin Yun. He knew what this defeat meant to him. This meant that he had become Lin Yun’s stepping stone and that he would be suppressed by Lin Yun for a long time.

“Sorry about it,” said Lin Yun as he looked at the Flower Burial Sword before turning back to Cao Zhen. He was signaling that he wanted to pull out his sword, which Cao Zhen approved of with a nod of his head.

When Lin Yun pulled out the Flower Burial Sword, blood spurted out of Cao Zhen’s wound and his face became distorted. But it only lasted for a moment before he relaxed. When his origin energy could circulate again within his body, he gasped for his breath as he got back up with great difficulty.

Based on that alone, anyone could tell how terrifying his cultivation was at the greater Yang stage.

“You grasped your xiantian sword intent before reaching the Violet Palace Realm?” Cao Zhen asked just when he was about to pass Lin Yun.

Lin Yun nodded. He didn’t bother hiding it from Cao Zhen.

“No wonder…” Cao Zhen smiled bitterly and his eyes dimmed. Once Lin Yun nodded his head, he knew that it was impossible for him to catch up to Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun had grasped the xiantian sword intent before reaching the Violet Palace Realm, just like his senior brother Nangong Wanyu.

Cao Zhen looked around before he sighed, “My loss wasn’t an unfair one. Others don't know what it means to grasp the xiantian sword intent before reaching the Violet Palace Realm, but I do. After all, my senior brother is that sort of monstrous genius…”

Cao Zhen then shook his head and went to retrieve his saber.

“What did he say?” asked Liu Yunyan and Mo Ling.

“Nothing much,” smiled Lin Yun as he fell into deep thought. He made up his mind to take a look at Nangong Wanyu at the Draconic Banquet.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
