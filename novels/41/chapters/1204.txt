Chapter 1205 - Wouldn't Give Up

After reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, the Demonic Astral Flowers in Lin Yun’s body had undergone a transformation, and he had two different uses for them. He could either let them bloom within his body or unleash the power contained in the flowers.

When Lin Yun defeated the Azure Dragon Sword Aura, he used this method to push his aura to the Astral Stage. If he used the second method, he would unleash the Demonic Astral Flowers from his body to form a domain that could be used to attack or defend. However, doing so was dangerous because the flowers would take a long time to recover if damaged. Additionally, he would consume a huge amount of origin energy to maintain this state.

There was also the option of combining all the Demonic Astral Flowers to form a new energy within his body, but that was difficult for Lin Yun at the moment. According to Lil’ Purple, the Demonic Astral Flowers could also be imprinted with divine runes. At that level, even a single petal could easily destroy the star. However, Lin Yun didn’t even know how to approach this method.

When Lin Yun summoned the 49 Demonic Astral Flowers from his body, the golden flowers began to circulate around him. When Feng Tianyuan charged over, Lin Yun suddenly soared into the sky and charged toward the former.

When the dragon collided with the falling meteorite, the collision created a huge explosion. Lin Yun pushed the Demonic Astral Flowers in his body to the limit and brandished his sword. Feng Tianyuan was surprised because he never expected that Lin Yun would be able to launch a counterattack under this state.

Remembering that Lin Yun had reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, Feng Tianyuan calmed down and changed his attack, “You’re still going to die!”

Countless starlight shined from his sword that instantly turned into blazing meteorites. The meteorites were so powerful that Lin Yun was easily trapped. When the other elders saw this, they watched indifferently and attacked from afar.

Every single sword ray that targeted Lin Yun could render him powerless if he was hit. At the same time, Feng Tianyuan sneered, “Little bastard, you’re too tender compared to me. So what if you’ve reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm? Let me see what trump card you have! Summon the genuine holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords if you can!”

Evidently, he knew that the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords had a genuine holy spirit, but he clearly didn’t think that Lin Yun was capable of summoning it. So Feng Tianyuan stabbed his sword with the other hand towards Lin Yun’s forehead

The speed of this sword was slow, but it was powerful. With the meteorites restricting Lin Yun’s movements, and the fatal attacks of the elders, there weren’t many ways Lin Yun could dodge.

Sensing the power of the sword, Lin Yun began to circulate his Demonic Astral Flowers. Feng Tianyuan’s sword might seem slow, but it would strike him swiftly if he wasn’t careful. At the same time, he would die if he didn’t do anything.

“Since I’ve made my move, how can I let you go? You’ve been waiting for me for a long time, but I’ve also been waiting for you! Those who dare to offend the Feng Clan will only end up dead!” Feng Tianyuan laughed sinisterly.

The audience was shocked by this scene as Feng Tianyuan was ready for the surprise attack that Lin Yun had prepared.

Killing intent also began to brew in Lin Yun’s pupils because he was thoroughly disgusted by Feng Tianyuan and Feng Clan. It finally made sense that Feng Xiaoyu’s maid was so arrogant.

Just when Lin Yun was about to be stabbed, he activated the Azure Dragon Mark. The crimson saint runes in the Azure Dragon Mark bloomed on his body and hundreds of purple-golden runes began to blaze on the surface of his body. At this moment, his physique was comparable to a hundred rune saint artifact.

“Die!” Seeing that Lin Yun was trying to struggle, Feng Tianyuan sped up and stabbed Lin Yun’s chest with a cruel smile. He was full of joy that he could kill Lin Yun.

But just when his sword was about to stab into Lin Yun, a huge sound echoed out. A massive dragon image began to gather towards Lin Yun’s chest as a shockwave spread out into the surroundings. Feng Tianyuan was shocked when he realized that his sword couldn’t stab Lin Yun. “The Azure Dragon Saint Physique!”

At this moment, he finally knew why his sword couldn’t stab into Lin Yun’s chest. So it turns out that Lin Yun had achieved the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, and that his physique was comparable to a hundred rune saint artifact. How could someone in the Heavenly Soul Realm inflict any damage on a hundred rune saint artifact? At the very least, he had to be in the Empyrean Realm to do it.

“Get lost!” Even if his physique was comparable to a hundred rune saint artifact, it was still difficult for Lin Yun to withstand. His face twisted in pain as he roared. With the Demonic Astral Flowers blooming, Feng Tianyuan was sent flying away while Lin Yun finally unleashed his killing intent and charged over.

“Soaring Azure Sky!” Lin Yun soared into the sky with a sword as large as a gigantic mountain. He unleashed a dazzling sword ray that destroyed the meteorites and sword rays of the elders. When his sword ray flew out, Feng Tianyun was also sent flying.

A ruthless light flashed in Lin Yun’s pupils and glared at Feng Tianyuan, executing the Golden Crow Nine Transformation before he chased up to Feng Tianyuan. This scene made the three elders exclaim before they quickly chased after Lin Yun. THey threw multiple attacks at him to stop him from chasing after Feng Tianyuan, “Not good!”

“You’re courting death!” Feng Tianyuan’s eyes flashed with a ferocious light because he knew what Lin Yun was planning to do. When he swung his sword out, nine stars bloomed behind him.

“Nine Stars Connection!” Borrowing the power of the holy spirit marital technique, Feng Tianyuan’s sword collided with Lin Yun’s sword. Everyone who saw this couldn’t believe that Lin Yun was chasing after Lin Yun while disregarding the attacks of the elders behind him.

Feng Tianyuan was a quasi-Dragon Pulse Realm expert and an ordinary empyrean would be left powerless with a glare from him. No one would have the courage to make a move against him, let alone the thought of killing him.

As the two sword rays collided, golden light flew through the sky. The three elders locked their brows together and stopped short of the flying sword rays..

There was no way that Lin Yun was unscathed from the elders’ attacks. Since they were so certain, they didn’t need to keep attacking because they might accidentally harm Feng Tianyuan. It was a clear and blatant scheme of Lin Yun.

Lin Yun would die if he faced all four enemies at the same time. So he had to focus on killing one person in order to break the Four Phase Sword Array.

“Wait!” The three elders sat down and closed their eyes while they accumulated their sword aura. They could afford to wait because they didn’t think that Lin Yun could defeat Feng Tianyuan while he was injured. Secondly, they would be heavily injured if they didn’t take care of themselves right now. So they took the time to recover while Lin Yun was preoccupied.

The crowd was amazed by the elders’ experience. Even the likes of Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan could feel their scalps going numb because they were like infants in front of the elders.

Suddenly, everyone turned their heads as the sky started to crack. Then, a bell rang out as starlight shined down on Lin Yun.

Under the starlight, all the phenomena in the plaza crumbled. The three elders opened their eyes and stared at a bloodied Lin Yun. “It’s that sword again!”

“Move out!” The three elders soared into the sky and charged at Lin Yun. They were determined to kill Lin Yun before he could swing his sword.

“Damn it!” Zhao Yan clenched his fist together because it wasn’t a fair fight. But even so, Lin Yun had no intention of stopping.

Without hesitation, Lin Yun swung his sword out as the Demonic Astral Flowers shined brightly. At this moment, he looked like the sun. Everyone could sense the power and sorrow of this sword as Lin Yun roared. Even though he was injured, he wasn’t going to give up. As long as he was still alive, he wouldn’t give up fighting.
