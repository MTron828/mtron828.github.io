Chapter 1669 – Aftermath

In the Sword Sect, Yu Qingfeng and the Radiant Sword Saint descended. When they landed, the time that stopped on the Radiant Sword Saint resumed, and it didn’t take long for Radiant Sword Saint’s appearance to become old. Looking at his reflection, the Radiant Sword Saint let out a sigh.

“What realm have you reached in your sword?” The Radiant Sword Saint asked.

Yu Qingfeng’s strength was too terrifying, and the sword intent from him could stop the Radiant Sword Saint’s vitality from slipping away. His sword intent was so strong that not even the flow of time could destroy it.

Yu Qingfeng briefly pondered before he smiled, “Slightly stronger than the last sword you used on Tian Xuanzi.”

“Above the ninth grade?” The Radiant Sword Saint said with surprise flashing across his pupils.

Yu Qingfeng merely replied with a smile.

The Radiant Sword Saint fell into a long silence before he smiled, “As I’ve expected…” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Why haven’t you become an Emperor yet?” Yu Qingfeng suddenly said. “I can tell you should’ve taken that step out with your strength.”

“It’s not that I don’t want to, but I can’t. If I hadn’t witness your fight with my master three thousand years ago, I might’ve already taken that step out. What I wanted was to never compete with the Emperors. One who has never witnessed the grace of the Nine Emperors wouldn’t know how strong they are.” The Radiant Sword Saint said, and a breeze suddenly blew.

A few plum petals fell onto the lake, and Yu Qingfeng grabbed a petal that flew past him. Looking at the petal, he said, “So, I’m the reason.”

At this moment, he finally understood that he was the tribulation in the Radiant Sword Saint’s heart. His act of slicing off two peaks three thousand years ago was still within the Radiant Sword Saint’s heart, which was why the Radiant Sword Saint couldn’t take that step out.

Flicking away the petal, Yu Qingfeng sighed, “I can’t help you with this. Even now, I can’t casually use that sword that I used three thousand years ago. Without an opponent like your master, I can’t easily slice off the two peaks. Even if my cultivation has grown when compared to the past, I can’t find the mental state from the past.”

His face was lonely because it was hard to find anyone worthy of him to use the sword he used three thousand years ago. Shortly after, Yu Qingfeng smiled, “Well, it looks like my trip here wasn’t in vain to pay off two favors. Radiant, we’re clear now, and I won’t come anymore.”

“Of course. I’m grateful for your help; otherwise, my disciple would be dead.” The Radiant Sword Saint looked at Yu Qingfeng with respect. Based on Yu Qingfeng’s strength and grace, he was completely worthy of his title as the Sword Emperor.

As Yu Qingfeng headed out with a smile, his voice resounded, “I’ll go take a look at the Celestial Observing Stage to look at the moon from back then. I won’t be coming back to the Sword Sect again. Then again, I might come and take a look to see if you’ve really become an Emperor. But…”

He had already left before he finished, but he probably wanted to say that he wouldn’t have that chance anymore. Although he saved the Radiant Sword Saint, he didn’t extend the latter’s lifespan. Judging by the Radiant Sword Saint’s current state, it would be long if he could live for another three years.

Outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield, five people finally broke out of the painting four hours after the Sword Emperor left.

The Flame Emperor waved his hand and stowed the painting. He said, “Yu Qingfeng is really generous to use this treasure just to trap us for four hours. Is it worth it for that kid?”

“Hasn’t he always been this way? He’s clearly lazy to interfere, but he suddenly appears whenever someone tries to interfere.” The Blade Emperor, Chen Zilong, said coldly.

“Can we still catch up?” The White Emperor asked, taking a gulp of the wine and looking in the direction Lin Yun left.

“We can’t chase after him anymore.” The Black Emperor’s face was cold. “That ice phoenix wasn’t only fast, she even concealed her aura along the way. She probably possesses the bloodline of the Ancient Phoenix.”

“Why can’t she be the Ancient Phoenix?” The Flame Emperor suddenly interrupted, instantly causing everyone’s faces to change and look at him. The Flame Emperor smiled, “I’m only speaking casually.”

Chen Zilong no longer dwelled on that and looked at the painting in the Flame Emperor’s hand. He asked, “So, how should we deal with this Divine Moon Painting?”

“Return to him. What else? Do you want to take it? That fellow is petty, and won’t let anyone touch the treasures he has gathered. If you really take it away, he will definitely come after you for it.” The Flame Emperor said.

“We’ll be taking our leave, first.” The Black and White Emperors said before they turned into streaks of light and left. The Flame Emperor followed behind them, taking the Divine Moon Painting with him.

“You should return with me. It’s not impossible to treat your injuries.” Chen Zilong looked at Tian Xuanzi.

“How can I possibly return when I’ve failed?” Tian Xuanzi bitterly smiled while shaking his head.

“What about your injuries?” Chen Zilong furrowed his brows.

“I’ll find a way to treat them. Yu Qingfeng’s sword might not precisely be a bad thing for me. My journey has been too smooth, and I’ve underestimated the Sword Sect and Radiant Sword Saint. Doesn’t the Radiant Sword Saint want to become an Emperor? Didn’t that brat say that he’ll return? I’ll wait for them, then!“ Tian Xuanzi said and bowed before leaving. But his silhouette looked desolate in the snow.

A white cat flew over from afar, finally bringing a smile to Tian Xuanzi’s face. He bowed down and took the cat in his embrace before he left.

Looking at Tian Xuanzi’s silhouette, Chen Zilong could tell that Tian Xuanzi had a backbone. But after this battle, the Profound Sky Sect would probably become quiet for a long time. This was because the losses they suffered this time weren’t just a Saint Lord but also the prestige that the Profound Sky Sect had accumulated over the years. It went down the drain, so the Profound Sky Sect probably wouldn’t do anything within three years.

This was a massive river with a width of over ten thousand meters. Even a Dragon Pulse Realm expert would feel tiny when standing before this river. Huge demonic beasts would occasionally break out from the river, creating waves from their appearance. This was the oldest river in the Ancient Barren Domain, the Desolate River.

There was a serene valley beside this river. This place was seven million miles away from the Ancient Barren Battlefield. When Lil’ Purple descended, she returned to her humanoid form.

When Lin Yun fell onto one knee, he threw out a mouthful of blood. The Firmament Saint Cloth had long been resealed within his body, and his injuries were horrendous.

Lil’ Purple quickly examined Lin Yun’s body before she said, “The damage to your four dragon pulses is too serious. Even with the Blue Dragon Bone, your dragon pulses won’t recover anytime soon. Give it a try.”

Lin Yun nodded and sat down to circulate the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art. The Blue Dragon Bone emitted light, but that light couldn’t enter the dragon pulses. The intense pain woke him up from his attempt when he tried to circulate his dragon origin.

“It hurts.” Lin Yun opened his mouth, and his lip started to twitch. A brief moment later, Lin Yun bitterly smiled, “I shouldn't be able to recover from my injuries within half a year. But, fortunately, I didn’t die.”

“What do you plan to do now?” Lil’ Purple asked, nodding her head.

Lin Yun briefly pondered before he took out an ancient blue medal, and his gaze fell onto the ‘Wind’ word engraved at the end.

“What is this?” Lil’ Purple asked curiously. “Why does it look so familiar?”

“This is the Wind God Order, and I’m now the Azure Dragon Lord.” Lin Yun roughly explained the matters with the Wind God Order to Lil’ Purple.

“I see…” Lil’ Purple nodded. “The real Divine Azure Order can be obtained by combining the Wind God Order and Thunder God Order. So you’ll have to travel to the Heaven Domain’s Unholy Sea and search for the Nirvana Pavilion before accepting the forces and inheritance of the Azure Dragon’s lineage that was left as the Azure Dragon Lord?”

Nodding his head, Lin Yun squinted his eyes, “I can only watch as I fake a step forth. It has been a hundred thousand years, and the Azure Dragon’s lineage might not believe me with the Wind God Order alone. Who knows…”

“At least you’re not naive.” Lil’ Purple said.

“A hundred thousand years is a long time. How can I possibly win everyone’s hearts with a medal? But I still have to give it a try. Tian Xuanzi’s forces are too great, and it’s hard for me to deal with him alone.” Lin Yun raised his head to look at Lil’ Purple.

He now knew who Tian Xuanzi was talking about when he said that the person his master was waiting for wouldn’t be coming. That person should be Yu Qingfeng. Yu Qingfeng ultimately came, but the fact that he was late was enough to prove that the forces behind Tian Xuanzi could stop the Sword Emperor.

This meant he had no choice but to travel to the Nirvana Pavilion. Looking at the Wind God Medal, Lin Yun sighed, “Furthermore…”

“Furthermore, what?”

“I promised Big Brother Jiang to make a trip, regardless of the outcome.” Lin Yun said with determination as he firmly held onto the Wind God Order.

Jiang Ling waited a hundred years before giving him the Wind God Order so he couldn’t let his big brother down. Even if this trip would be dangerous, he still had to make a trip over.

“It won’t take long for what happened in the Ancient Barren Domain to shake the entire Kunlun Realm. Your Firmament Saint Cloth will bring you a great threat at that time. How do you plan on dealing with it?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“I already have a solution: the Divine Tortoise Transformation. I can practice it now since I’m in the Dragon Pulse Realm. At that time, even Saints won’t be able to see through my disguise.” Lin Yun said after stowing the Wind God Order.

Lil’ Purple fell into deep thoughts because she never thought of the Divine Tortoise Transformation.

“Is this place safe?” Lin Yun asked.

“No one should be able to find this place within ten days. I have also erased our aura along the way.” Lil’ Purple said after a brief pondering.

“Where’s Lil’ Red?” Lin Yun asked.

“Don’t worry about it. It will find its way over.” Lil’ Purple was pretty confident about it.

Hearing what Lil’ Purple said, Lin Yun took a pouch from his interspatial pouch.

“What is this?”

“My master gave me this pouch, but I don’t know what’s inside. My master didn’t allow me to open it and only told me to open it when the time was right. I’m guessing that this is the right time, now…” Lin Yun said, muttering to himself as he looked at the pouch. To be honest, Lin Yun was also curious about what was in this pouch.
