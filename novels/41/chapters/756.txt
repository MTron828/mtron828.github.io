Chapter 757 - Breakthrough

I can’t take the fruit? Lin Yun was inwardly shocked by the three thousand years old fruit. Even after destroying its unique domain, he still couldn’t obtain it. Just when Lin Yun was briefly distracted, a dragon head suddenly pounced at him as it unleashed a roar along with a blazing heatwave.

This forced Lin Yun to let go of the fruit and to throw three punches. He retreated a hundred meters with each step to get away from the blazing heatwave. Once he stabilized his footing, his sword aura fluctuated and hummed.

“Are you done? Do you really think that there’s nothing I can do to you?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with rage as the Flamedragon Fruit contained genuine intelligence and even inherited the Flame Dragon’s violent personality. With just a thought, Lin Yun formed seals with both his hands and charged at the Flamedragon Fruit once more.

This time, his footsteps were slow as he unleashed his spiritual sword intent with no restraint. With every step, a sword ray streaked across the horizon and starlight lit up Lin Yun’s surroundings.

Ten steps later, Lin Yun’s sword aura had reached the limit that his body could handle. Now, every single step caused the ground to tremble violently.

When the Flamedragon Fruit felt threatened, golden flames began to descend from above as it condensed into a golden flame dragon. It wasn’t an illusion, but a genuine dragon condensed from flames. It charged towards Lin Yun when he was a hundred meters away from the fruit.

Lin Yun wore a grave expression as he was reaching his limit with the spiritual sword intent. Seeing that the flame dragon was about to reach him, Lin Yun snorted as his right palm hit the ground. How can a firefly compare with the sun and moon?

The fireflies around Lin Yun began to blaze as his sword aura shined like a star. When his right palm hit the ground, terrifying ravines formed and dust flew into the air. Just like that, the flame dragon was sliced into pieces by his sword intent.

But the crack on the ground still continued to spread out. In just a while, the flame dragon was shrouded in golden light as it tried to escape.

“You want to leave? Impossible!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he stomped his foot on the ground and reached out for the Flamedragon Fruit. When he grabbed onto the golden light, it was like he had subdued a ferocious dragon in his hand. No matter how the dragon struggled, it was completely suppressed by his sword intent.

Fifteen minutes later, the golden light dissipated and revealed the Flamedragon Fruit. The fruit was the size of his feet with a vivid flame dragon engraved on its surface.

“He actually succeeded.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture descended and looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.

“According to rules, I should share half of it with you,” said Lin Yun.

“No, I don’t need it. You saved my life. Plus, the Draconic Banquet is starting soon. You should refine all of it. I have the dragon clan’s bloodline and I have a long lifespan. I don’t have much requirement for treasures.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture rejected.

“You know the Draconic Banquet as well?” Lin Yun asked.

“What do you think? I’ve lived for hundreds of years. Furthermore, the Heavenly Demon Pavilion invited me to their sect back then, but I rejected them,” replied the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

“Why?” Lin Yun couldn’t understand why the Indigothunder Dragonvulture would reject the offer. After all, the Heavenly Demon Pavilion was an overlord force and they definitely had many demon clans cultivation techniques.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture glanced at Lin Yun and said, “Demon and demonic beasts aren’t the same. When a demonic beast reaches a high realm, they can choose to get rid of their beast instincts and retain their demonic instincts. In the end, they won’t look any different from humans. So great demons and their descendants don't have any beast instincts, but such noble bloodlines are rare in the Profound Amber Realm. I wish to retain my beast instincts and continue to evolve into a Primordial Ominous Beast, Saint Beast, or even become a Divine Beast. So I rejected them.”

This was the first time Lin Yun heard such secrets. They were two completely different paths, but no one was sure which was better.

“It’s not easy to refine a Flamedragon Fruit that’s three thousand years old. I suggest you refine it slowly. I can stay here to guard you.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture suggested this idea to Lin Yun.

“Thank you then.” Lin Yun naturally had no reason to refuse since the Indigothunder Dragonvulture was willing to protect him. It was just as the Indigothunder Dragonvulture had said, the vitality contained in the fruit was too massive, so it wouldn’t be easy to refine it.

“I’ll eat the dragon claw first.” Lin Yun tore out the dragon claw from the fruit and swallowed it. When the piece of fruit entered his mouth, it instantly melted and a blazing energy coursed through his body. It felt as if his entire body had become a cauldron as his face turned red and mist rose from his head. The medicinal effect was too terrifying…

This startled Lin Yun as he crossed his legs together and circulated the Azure Dragon Enneaform. Then, ancient azure dragon energy began to course through his body as it greedily devoured the Flamedragon Fruit’s medicinal effect.

The Azure Dragon Mark on his chest began to bloom and his heart throbbed with power. Every single time his heart throbbed, he would release a powerful energy that made the surrounding air fluctuate. When the Indigothunder Dragonvulture saw this scene, its eyes lit up as it felt a familiar aura coming from the dragon runes on Lin Yun’s body.

As Lin Yun sank into his cultivation, the Azure Dragon Enneaform improved quickly and he made a breakthrough in the blink of an eye. Under Lin Yun’s control, the azure dragon energy coursed through his body and constructed profound patterns on his body.

As he continued to circulate the Azure Dragon Enneaform, the azure dragon energy within his body grew even more powerful. With just a wisp of it, he could easily shatter an ordinary profound artifact now.

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye as Lin Yun made another breakthrough in his Azure Dragon Enneaform. He had reached the quadform stage. The dragon runes on his body had also increased to twenty-one, which represented two hundred and eleven cauldron’s worth of strength.

Sweeping a glance, Lin Yun saw the Indigothunder Dragonvulture not far away and smiled, “Come!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He then stomped his foot on the ground and shot over towards the Indigothunder Dragonvulture. The Indigothunder Dragonvulture barely woke up and swiped its claw at Lin Yun.

With blood dripping from his lips, Lin Yun was sent flying and he created a huge crater on the ground.

“You’re too weak. I only used 30% of my strength,” said the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

“It hurts.” Lin Yun felt as though his bones were breaking apart. If someone else saw this scene, they would be shocked that Lin Yun dared to clash with an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast with his physique.

“I’m in no rush.” Lin Yun smiled and swallowed the tail of the fruit. He knew that he needed the Azure Dragon Enneaform to reach a high level in order to fight an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast. After all, the Indigothunder Dragonvulture wasn’t an ordinary overlord but one with the dragon clan’s bloodline.

Six days later, Lin Yun underwent another transformation and his vitality became as immense as an ancient beast. He had reached the pentaform stage in the Azure Dragon Enneaform. He soared into the sky and clashed with the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, but he was sent flying back again. This time, it was even worse as his right arm was half crippled.

This was because the Indigothunder Dragonvulture had accidentally used 50% of its strength upon seeing Lin Yun charging over. But Lin Yun’s improvement was clear as he only needed three days to recover from such heavy injuries.

Half a month later, Lin Yun reached the hexaform stage of the Azure Dragon Enneaform. Then, he clashed with the Indigothunder Dragonvulture for the third time. The dragon runes on his body had reached a terrifying number of fifty-four. So, Lin Yun wasn’t knocked flying back and managed to stabilize himself in their third clash.

He used his boundless vitality to withstand the immense force, which was a huge improvement. But when he raised his head to look at the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, the Indigothunder Dragonvulture didn’t even budge from its spot.

“Lil’ Purple, you don’t seem to have used your overlord pressure at all,” said Lin Yun. Lil’ Purple was the nickname he gave the Indigothunder Dragonvulture after they became familiar with each other.

“Call me that again and I won’t mind letting you have the taste of the overlord pressure.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture glared at Lin Yun.

“Alright, alright. I got it, Lil’ Purple.” Lin Yun smiled.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture roared as it flapped its wings. This made Lin Yun smile awkwardly as he quickly dodged to the side.

Suddenly, a powerful aura spread out. When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see a golden light piercing the clouds far away that turned into boundless flames. It melted all the clouds in its path and turned them into rain. Lin Yun was inwardly shocked by this power as the cultivator practically summoned rain.

“He was the one who injured me a month ago. I never expected that he would have gotten stronger after he recovered from his injuries. If I remember correctly, he seems to be known as Yan Long’zi, one of the three kings.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture glanced at Lin Yun and said, “You have to put in more effort, brat.”

Lin Yun was shocked. The power of the three things is strong enough to injure a terrifying existence like the Indigothunder Dragonvulture… actually Yan Long’zi should be even more powerful now.
