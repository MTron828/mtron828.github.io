Chapter 2159 - Don't Pretend

Lin Yun bitterly smiled because no one believed him when he was speaking the truth, and there was nothing he could do about it. No matter what, Ye Qingtian and Gu Xiyan made a move one after another, especially Gu Xiyan, who killed Tian Gu. With that, the storm had finally come to an end.

But Tian Gu and Gu Xinyu had a great impact, which resulted in many vacant seats. Over the next period of time, the cultivators began to compete amongst themselves again. On the contrary, the Heavenly Dragon Stage was peaceful since no one went up on it first.

Amongst the nine dragon lords, it could be confirmed that the Indigo Dragon Lord and True Dragon Lord wouldn’t participate in the competition for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position. The only candidates qualified to compete for that title were the remaining six Divine Dragon Lords and the Azure Dragon Lord. If Ye Qingtian was included, there would only be eight people competing for that title.

Aside from Lin Yun, the other seven would face consequences if they failed. The moment they failed, they would lose their spots on their respective Dragon’s Heads. It was fine if they could obtain the title as the Heavenly Dragon Lord, but the loss would be significant if they failed.

Most importantly, many people were reconsidering their decision after witnessing Gu Xiyan’s strength. It was fine if Gu Xiyan had no intentions for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title, but if he wanted to compete for it, they would practically have no chance.

Gu Xinyu and Tian Gu were arrogant. Although the other Divine Dragon Lords didn’t want to reveal too much of their strength, they weren’t that confident in their own strength. If they were confident in their own strength, they would’ve stood out to face Tian Gu and Gu Xinyu to garner attention. Gu Xiyan was now shining so brightly that he almost overshadowed everyone.

“It looks like the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title is more or less Gu Xiyan’s!”

“As long as Gu Xiyan wants to compete for that title, no one will dare to clash with him head-on.”

“Who dares fight him head-on? It was fine if they won, but they would lose their initial spot if they lost.”

“They’re now waiting for Gu Xiyan to open his mouth.” Countless gazes fell onto Gu Xiyan, who had shut his eyes to adjust his breathing after killing Tian Gu, ignoring the outside world.

“Gu Xiyan, are you going to compete for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title? Give the word.” In the end, Ye Linghao, who was the Champion of the Second Heavenly Path spoke out. His words represented many people, including the Dao Yang Holy Son, who was looking at Gu Xiyan.

The act of killing Tian Gu not only demonstrated Gu Xiyan’s powerful strength, but also brought him a great reputation. In the end, this was a world where only the strong would be respected. If Gu Xiyan wanted the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title, the other dragon lords would be convinced to let him have it. But it would be another story if it was someone else.

Gu Xiyan opened his eyes and wore a smile. But he wasn’t polite as he said, “That means everyone here has no intentions to compete for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title?”ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ye Linghao said, “The Heavenly Dragon Lord is above the seven Divine Dragon Lords. We won’t be convinced if someone wants to compete for it. But we have nothing to say if you want it.”

“That’s right. We won’t compete for it if you want it.”

“Same here.” The Dragon Lords began to express that they wouldn’t compete with Gu Xiyan. It wasn’t because they were generous, and they would give it a try if they didn’t have any concerns. But if they lost, they might even lose their position. So they might as well become generous, not to mention Gu Xiyan possessed the strength to be the Heavenly Dragon Lord.

The Dao Yang Holy Son didn’t say a word because he already had a plan in mind. His strength was on par with Gu Xinyan, and he even had a certain chance of beating Gu Xinyan, but the odds weren’t high.

“Since that’s the case, there’s no need for me to be modest, then.” Gu Xiyan soared to the sky, heading towards the Heavenly Dragon Stage. But when he approached, the pressure from the Heavenly Dragon Stage came crashing down accompanied by the roar of a Heavenly Dragon.

The nine dragon heads began to tremble, and the faces of those on the thrones changed. They were shocked by the powerful aura from the Heavenly Dragon Stage. The aura given off by the Heavenly Dragon Stage was comparable to a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase.

But before they could be surprised, Gu Xiyan raised his hand and shattered the incoming Heavenly Dragon aura before firmly landing on the stage. The stage was the highest point of the Dragon Mountain. As Gu Xiyan looked around, he exclaimed, “The scenery here is really good.”

Just like what others said. The Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title was above the seven divine dragons, the one who obtained the title would also become the Champion of the Blue Dragon Record, ranking first. They would be able to leave their names on the Blue Dragon Record and be admired for generations to come.

But Gu Xiyan found it a pity because Flower Burial wasn’t around, and he felt that he didn’t fully deserve the title as the Heavenly Dragon Lord.

The person he was thinking about had his attention on other things at this moment. Lin Yun has been observing the vertical silver eye and blood moon above the demonic clouds. He initially thought that the saints behind Gu Xinyu and Tian Gu would make a move, but they were terrifyingly calm. When Tian Gu was killed, the vertical eye closed and gradually disappeared. The crimson moon also soared to the sky and gradually faded away.

Although everyone heaved a sigh of relief, Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless. He wouldn’t worry if those two made a move, but they were terrifyingly calm to be indifferent even when Tian Gu was killed.

“Ye Qingtian, Gu Xiyan is already standing on the Heavenly Dragon Stage,” Ji Zixi said, interrupting Lin Yun’s thoughts. Her eyes were shining brightly since she hadn’t forgotten what Lin Yun said earlier.

“No one wants to challenge him?” Lin Yun was surprised to see that no one wanted to challenge Gu Xiyan. This left him a little disappointed because he was hoping for there to be a fight so Bai Shuying and Xin Yan could obtain a spot on the dragon heads.

“Nope. It’s all on you now,” Ji Zixi teased.

“Don’t add oil to the fire. Don’t forget that Ye Qingtian saved your life.” Bai Shuying glared at Ji Zixi. In the eyes of others, Ji Zixi was the little princess of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, but Bai Shuying naturally wouldn’t back off because of her identity.

“It’s alright. I did say that,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Big Brother Ye, you have a good temper. I’ll wait for you to win, then!” Ji Zixi blinked. She didn’t believe that Ye Qingtian would dare to go on the Heavenly Dragon Stage to fight Gu Xiyan.

“Why don’t we make a bet and see if I can obtain the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Sure. What do you want to bet about?” Ji Zixi smiled with her interest piqued. She didn’t believe that Ye Qingtian dared to compete for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title and what he said about only using half of his strength. She felt that Ye Qingtian wouldn’t have much odds of winning, even if he really went on the Heavenly Dragon Stage.

Ji Zixi opened her eyes wide as she waited for Lin Yun to reply.

Lin Yun didn’t say anything, but transmitted his voice over, “Do you remember the Phoenix Heart Song back on the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea?”

Ji Zixi widened her eyes when she heard that, and she exclaimed, “H-How do you know about that?”

A year ago when she reached a bottleneck in the Sacred Phoenix Canon, her bloodline had run into a bottleneck, and she couldn’t condense the Sacred Phoenix Wings no matter how she tried. But when she listened to the Phoenix Heart Song that night, she successfully made a breakthrough.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to call her a monstrous genius to condense the Sacred Phoenix Wings at her age. So what happened that night left a deep impression on her. Not only was she able to make a breakthrough in her bloodline, but she even saw Yue Weiwei kissing Lin Yun. She had a feeling that Yue Weiwei did it on purpose. She still remembered how Yue Weiwei looked at her back then, and that made her lose it.

Bai Shuying and Xin Yan also turned their attention over, not knowing why Ji Zixi lost her composure.

When Ji Zixi came to her senses, she transmitted her voice over, “How do you know about that? Who the hell are you? Are you Flower Burial?”

Lin Yun didn’t reply to that question and transmitted his voice back, “You only have to remember our agreement back then and help out when it’s time.”

The Divine Phoenix Mountain had an ancient legacy, and it was an immortal holy land alongside the Heavenly Dao Sect. But the Heavenly Dao Sect was only strong on the outside and corrupted on the inside. If it wasn’t for the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword, the Heavenly Dao Sect would’ve fallen apart, since they didn’t have much fighting prowess.

But the Divine Phoenix Mountain was different because they had an ancient legacy, inheriting the phoenix’s bloodline.

“What are you two talking about? Why are you guys secretly talking amongst yourselves before us?” Bai Shuying said unhappily.

“I’m only making a bet with the little princess. If I win, she’ll become the Phoenix Holy Maiden of our Heavenly Dao Sect, or the Phoenix Divine Maiden works as well,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Are you serious about that?” Bai Shuying smiled.

Ji Zixi’s face turned red, and she said unhappily, “But if you fail, you have to become the son-in-law of my Divine Phoenix Mountain. You have to take my maid as your wife because you’re not worthy of a holy maiden!”

“The stakes are a little too high,” Lin Yun said.

Right then, a powerful pressure swept out from the Heavenly Dragon Stage, spreading to every corner of the Dragon Mountain. Gu Xiyan waited for sometime and ran out of patience. He questioned, “I, Gu Xiyan, will become the Heavenly Dragon Lord. Does anyone have an opinion about it?”

Gu Xiyan’s words immediately caused an uproar. His words were a little arrogant, but no one could refute his words because Gu Xiyan had waited for a long time. If anyone wanted to refute his words, they would’ve gone up onto the stage long ago.

Seeing that no one said anything, Gu Xiyan asked again, “Does anyone disagree with me becoming the Heavenly Dragon Lord?”

The surroundings fell into silence since they could sense the power radiating from Gu Xiyan’s words, and this was a form of deterrent. He wasn’t asking, but was questioning if anyone disagrees.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word as he soared to the sky, using his fingers as a sword to hack at the Heavenly Dragon’s aura before landing on the Heavenly Dragon Stage. Everything happened in the blink of an eye, and many people didn’t even see how Lin Yun appeared on the stage.

“I’m Flower Burial, burying flower and people alike.” But just when Gu Xiyan was about to speak, Lin Yun muttered those words with his back facing Gu Xiyan.

The moment Lin Yun said that, Gu Xiyan squinted as his fighting spirits soared to the sky, causing the entire Dragon Mountain to tremble. This shocked everyone because the fighting spirits coming from Gu Xiyan were too frightening.

But when Lin Yun turned around, Gu Xiyan’s smile froze on his face. He was furious, and coldly said, “Ye Qingtian, what are you playing at? Do you think you’re Flower Burial?”

“As long as anyone has the heart to pursue the sword, anyone can be Flower Burial. So I can naturally become Flower Burial as well,” Lin Yun smiled.

Gu Xiyan didn’t have any expression on his face. With contempt in his eyes, he coldly said, “Don’t pretend. You’re unworthy.”
