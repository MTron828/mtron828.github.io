Chapter 1098 - Shameless!

Lin Yun’s style was the same as when he suppressed the Realm Sons. If he wanted, he could have killed all of the Realm Sons, so he was basically toying with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. However, he wasn’t going to hold back. Otherwise, he would be doing a disservice to his experience in the Heavenly Path.

In the past year, he had experienced many life and death situations. Many people hit rock bottom, but he was one of the only ones who got back up and shined brightly in the final battle. He even became the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path. The pain and hardship he had gone through wasn’t something these people could understand.

Lin Yun had already retracted his sword aura, but Wu Kun was still on his knees staring off into space. He couldn’t believe that he lost so terribly in his sword intent.

Sky sword intent? Suddenly, Wu Kun thought of something and looked at Lin Yun. He believed that he was around the same age as Lin Yun. Although he was better in terms of cultivation, it seemed like his sword intent was lacking.

Wu Kun would never have guessed that Lin Yun grasped the sky sword intent. After all, the elders who grasped sky sword intent in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect could be counted on one hand.

Even among the core disciples, only two people managed to grasp sky sword intent after reaching the Empyrean Realm. But their sky sword intent wasn’t even in lesser mastery. So no one knew better than Wu Kun of how difficult it was to grasp sky sword intent before reaching the Empyrean Realm. But it seemed like Lin Yun had grasped sky sword intent before reaching the Empyrean Realm!

Wu Kun was shocked by his speculation, but he didn’t dare to believe it.

“Senior brother, didn’t you say that he didn’t even make it onto the white ranking?” A core disciple beside Feng Zhang asked in disbelief.

Feng Zhang’s face was ugly. After all, he was the one who spread the rumors that Lin Yun didn’t make it onto the white ranking. Back then, when he humiliated Lin Yun, there were many core disciples in attendance. So today, they were watching Feng Zhang eat his words. After all, someone who wasn’t even on the white ranking was sweeping through the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

Seeing that no one was uttering a word, Lin Yun smiled, “No one is speaking up? It looks like everyone has no objections about me becoming a core disciple and ascending the Sword Saint Mountain. This is boring. I’m a reasonable person, so I’ll listen to any single one of you. Speak up, don’t hold it in.”

Lin Yun’s words made all the disciples want to throw up blood, but there was nothing they could do with Wu Kun on his knees. If they could, they would’ve given Lin Yun a beating by now. All of them were grinding their teeth, but none of them could do a thing.

“Hmph!” Ye Ziling’s eyes flashed with rage. If the sect master didn’t give her any instruction beforehand, she would’ve taught Lin Yun a lesson by now. As for the other disciples, their eyes were also flashing with unwillingness. However, none of them stood up because of their cultivation.

As empyreans, it would mean nothing even if they won. Furthermore, they knew that the sect master wouldn’t be happy about it. So there was nothing he could do to Lin Yun.

“Thank you. From now on, we’re all brothers,” said Lin Yun while cupping his hands towards everyone. He didn’t care about the identity of a core disciple, but he was interested in Sword Saint Mountain. He wanted to find out what secrets it held.

“Sect Master, there’s something I’d like to say!” Right at this moment, Feng Zhang stood out and cupped his hands at the sect master.

The sect master merely glanced at them and replied, “Speak. Didn’t you hear what he said? It’s not good to bear it all in.”

“Yes!” Feng Zhang was initially uneasy when he spoke out, but when he heard the sect master, he speculated that the sect master also wasn’t happy about Lin Yun.

A core disciple is finally going to make a move? None of the disciples could accept the fact that the empyreans were sitting idly by. However, it made sense because empyreans had no place against a Heavenly Soul Realm. So for a split moment, everyone’s gazes fell onto Feng Zhang.

“What is he going to do?” Wang Yuruo asked uneasily, worried that Feng Zhang would be shameless.

“Let’s just keep watching.” Ye Ziling frowned because she had been unhappy with Feng Zhang for a while now.

Feng Zhang came prepared and smiled, “I have no objections about promoting him as a core disciple. However, I can’t say the same about the Sword Saint Mountain quota. I feel that he doesn’t have that qualification!”

His words made many core disciples light up in agreement. It wouldn’t matter to them if Lin Yun became a core disciple because they were already core disciples. So having another core disciple wouldn’t affect them, but they were concerned with the quota to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“That’s right,” said Ye Ziling. Seeing Ye Ziling agree, Wang Yuruo couldn’t help becoming uneasy. After all, Lin Yun had agreed to help her. And he was only qualified to help her because he went slaughtered his way through the Heavenly Path. Naturally, it was the same reason why he could suppress the disciples in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“Brat, a core disciple of my sect says that you aren’t qualified for the quota. Why don’t you give up on the quota to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain?” The sect master raised his eyebrow and looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile.

But his words made Lin Yun curse inwardly. Wearing a mocking smile, Lin Yun replied, “How shameless for an empyrean to compete with me. I have to admit that I’m not as shameless as your core disciple. I’ll give up on it then, along with becoming a core disciple. After all, I’m not as shameless as someone else here.”

Lin Yun was arrogant, but he wasn’t arrogant enough to challenge empyreans, at least not right now. If he faced an empyrean realm, he would have to reveal a lot of his trump cards to maintain undefeated. So since Feng Zhang’s cultivation was higher, he would have low odds of winning.

Lin Yun’s ridiculing tone made everyone feel terrible. But Feng Zhang was even more shameless. Even the other core disciples had shame on their faces because they also thought that it wasn’t appropriate for an empyrean to face someone in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

Buet Feng Zhang had no fear and smiled, “If you’re willing to give me the quota, then, of course, I can accept it.”

Face was nothing to Feng Zhang as long as he could ascend the Sword Saint Mountain. Plus, he felt that he was a lot more qualified than Lin Yun.

“He’s too much!” Wang Yuruo’s face turned red with her fists clenched together.

Even Ye Ziling was sneering inwardly because Feng Zhang was simply shameless. Even the other core disciples distanced themselves from him.

“Feng Zhang, do you want any face?” The sect master suddenly spoke out.

“I…” Feng Zhang’s heart trembled. If he could, he really wanted to say that he didn’t want any face because it was nothing compared to ascending the Sword Saint Mountain. However, he could sense the warning in the sect master’s tone.

“Face is nothing. You can forsake it, but I can’t. Do you want to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain? Sure, make him give it out,” said the sect master with a smile.

Feng Zhang rolled his eyes before he had an idea and looked at Lin Yun, “Lin Yun, I won’t bully you. I’ll suppress my cultivation to the Heavenly Soul Realm. As long as you can last three…no, ten moves in my hands, I won’t compete with you anymore.”

He initially wanted to say three moves, but he changed to ten after recalling how strong Lin Yun was. With a smile, Feng Zhang continued, “Then again, I also won’t use my holy spirit martial technique to bully you.”

“Looks like the disciples in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect are really kind. All of you say that you won’t bully me. But since you’re courting humiliation, I don’t mind fulfilling this small wish of yours,” smiled Lin Yun.

“You’re really sharp with your words, but I won’t punish you just because I’m an empyrean,” smiled Feng Zhang. He didn’t care about Lin Yun’s words because he would soon obtain the chance to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain. After all, Lin Yun had agreed to his challenge.

Although Feng Zhang was a little shameless, his strength was still widely recognized. So no one expected that Lin Yun would actually agree to it without any hesitation.

“Junior Brother Yun, Senior Brother Feng is in the pinnacle Star Stage. You have to be careful.” Wang Yuruo transmitted her voice to Lin Yun, to which Lin Yun smiled.

The Empyrean Realm had three stages, the Star, Galaxy, and Astral Stages. Since Feng Zhang was in the pinnacle Star Stage, he could reach the Galaxy Stage at any time. Even among the core disciples, this was a great achievement. But to Lin Yun, Feng Zhang was courting humiliation if he wanted to fight while suppressing his cultivation.

All of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s were surprised that Lin Yun would agree to the challenge. But Lin Yun had a great reason. He was unhappy with Feng Zhang, so he was going to punish him. So what if he had to face an empyrean? Was that impressive?
