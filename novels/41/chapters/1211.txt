Chapter 1212 - Reaching the Empyrean Realm

Lil’ Purple’s words stunned Lin Yun because he never thought about keeping the sword. Truth be told, he was tempted by her suggestion. Looking down at the sword, Lin Yun muttered, “It’s such a pity to seal this sword for 18 years.”

Perhaps it was even longer than 18 years. After all, the old geezer lost this sword to Feng Xuanzi when he was young. He could imagine how the old geezer swept through the Eastern Desolation and built a name for himself with this sword.

At the same time, the old geezer’s surname was actually Jian, like the founder of the Firmament Sword Sect, Jian Wuming. Furthermore, the person to create the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra also had the surname Jian.

Lin Yun knew that there was a story behind the surname Jian and it must have a lot of significance in Kunlun Realm. After all, not everyone could have Jian as their surname. The old geezer having such a powerful sword at a young age was enough to imply that he definitely had a mysterious background.

The fact that the old geezer could use the Lightning Shadow Sword without being seized by anyone was enough to prove that he definitely had a powerful clan or a master. Otherwise, the old geezer would have been targeted like Lin Yun was being targeted right now. No one was deterred by his identity as a Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s disciple. Instead, they were worried about Luo Hua’s background.

Furthermore, the fact that Ye Ziling had the surname Ye and not Jian was enough to prove that there was a story Lin Yun didn’t know about.

“What are you dozing off for? Didn’t you hear what I said?” Lil’ Purple pouted unhappily.

“I definitely have to return the Lightning Shadow Sword. I have my Flower Burial Sword, which is enough for me. Speaking of which, do you have any ways to upgrade the Flower Burial Sword to a saint artifact?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s just a stupid sword, how can it be compared to the Lightning Shadow Sword? Hand your sword over. Let this empress look at it for you,” said Lil’ Purple unhappily as she took the Flower Burial Sword and gently held onto the sword hilt.

Something awkward happened because Lil’ Purple failed to unsheathe the sword. Her face even turned red from how hard she was straining herself.

“This makes no sense…” Lil’ Purple muttered.

“This sword received the acknowledgment of the broken sword on the first go, which the Lightning Shadow Sword failed to do. It might have been a divine artifact in the past. Plus, the Southern Emperor used this sword when he was alive,” smiled Lin Yun before he unsheathed the sword.

At the same time, Lin Yun shared with Lil’ Purple how he upgraded the Flower Burial Sword so far. But the saint artifact involved saint runes or divine runes. The runes on the Flower Burial Sword were natural and they weren’t divine runes or saint runes. So he had no idea how to upgrade it now.

“This empress said that you’ll have to imprint saint runes on the Demonic Astral Flowers in the future, right? There are actually some flowers that will give birth to saint runes when they mature. As for divine runes… anyway, you only need to find those flowers to let your sword devour their runes to upgrade,” said Lil’ Purple with her eyes flickering while looking at the sword.

“It’s hard to find those flowers, right? At least we have a direction now.” Lin Yun felt relieved upon hearing Lil’ Purple’s words. “I’m going to make a breakthrough, so guard me with Lil’ Red.”

“There’s no way this empress will guard you. Get your Luo Hua to guard you!” Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes and left. But Lin Yun could feel that she had stopped after she left the courtyard and began to set up arrays around the courtyard.

This made Lin Yun smile because Lil’ Purple was still as cute as before. Collecting his thoughts, Lin Yun tapped his interspatial pouch and took out the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit. When he looked at the fruit, his expression gradually became grave.

Half a year had passed in the blink of an eye, and he could recall the life and death he had gone through to obtain this fruit. He initially thought that he could use it after reaching Kunlun Realm, but half a year had passed and he still wasn’t in the Empyrean Realm.

Currently, he had reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, obtained the divine firmament sword intent, achieved the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, and comprehended the manifestation stage of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. He had already excavated all of his potential and it was just a matter of time before he reached the Empyrean Realm.

The Empyrean Realm was divided into three stages, the Star, Galaxy, and Astral Stages. Since he was going to make a breakthrough, he naturally had to reach the Galaxy Stage. After all, it would be a waste if he only reached the Star Stage with his foundation.

If possible, he even wanted to reach the Astral Stage. And with the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit, it was possible.

At this moment, thousands of Divine Astral Pellets littered the room, filling the surroundings with origin energy. With all of these preparations, Lin Yun swallowed the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit. When he devoured the fruit, he could sense immense energy filling his body.

After all, the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit only matured after nine thousand years. It contained unimaginable power that others could only dream of. Then, Lin Yun slowly closed his eyes and suppressed his emotions.

As Lin Yun circulated his sword sutra, origin energy fluctuated within his body and an iris flower appeared beneath him containing a powerful sword aura and origin energy to refine the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit in his body.

While Lin Yun refined the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit, his cultivation slowly reached the bottleneck of the Heavenly Soul Realm. Four hours later, the origin energy within Lin Yun’s body began to grow insanely. When his origin energy reached its limit, Lin Yun could clearly sense his physique and sword intent strengthening.

The breakthrough was smooth because his foundation was shocking. Plus, the Sword Assembly allowed him to undergo a transformation, boosting his comprehension of the sword. Now that Lin Yun had consumed the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit, he was undergoing a transformation every single second.

An hour later, Lin Yun could sense that his origin energy was about to transform. “Am I going to reach the Empyrean Realm now?”

Lin Yun knew that his origin energy was about to be upgraded to astral energy. At the same time, he would have to say goodbye to the Heavenly Soul Realm. As starlight began to shine out of Lin Yun’s body, it looked like Lin Yun was enveloped in starlight. This was a sign that Lin Yun was reaching the Empyrean Realm and that his origin energy was transforming into astral energy.

As Lin Yun activated the Azure Dragon Mark in his heart, hundreds of purple-golden runes covered the surface of his body and ignited, bringing the strength of his physique to the height of a hundred-rune saint artifact. When he was done, Lin Yun calmly refined the rest of the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit.

When he fully refined the energy contained in the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit, the origin energy in Lin Yun’s body erupted like a volcano. But Lin Yun was prepared for it as his physique comparable to a saint artifact stabilized the energy.

Lin Yun let out a ferocious roar and the origin energy in his body began to ignite, breaking the bottleneck of the Heavenly Soul Realm easily. At the same time, starlight came down from the sky and fused with Lin Yun’s body, slowly transforming his origin energy. The density of his astral energy was a lot stronger than others now.

If Lin Yun wasn’t careful, this conversion might take his life. But Lin Yun was careful and prepared. After reaching the Empyrean Realm, he converted his origin energy to astral energy. After an hour, he was done.

Starlight shined out of his pores that made him look like a star. With a shout, he retracted all of the starlight into his body. The bottleneck of the origin energy easily broke as rivers of light flowed into his violet palace.

Soon after, the boundless astral energy in his body formed nine rivers of stars, signifying the pinnacle Galaxy Stage. It wasn’t normal to jump into the Galaxy Stage from the Heavenly Soul Realm, but it was normal for Lin Yun. When the nine rivers were formed, Lin Yun tried to reach the Astral Stage but he had pain all over his face. It looks like he was a little too rash and his cultivation wasn’t stable enough.

Lin Yun stopped his attempt and opened his eyes. He stood up to test the power of the Galaxy Stage. Suddenly, a powerful aura descended upon the courtyard of the Huang Clan.

“Dragon Pulse Realm?” Lin Yun locked his brows together. Not only the Dragon Pulse Realm, but he could even sense that many Elysium Core Realm experts had descended onto the Haung Clan. Zhao Yan’s words came true. It wouldn’t be easy for him to leave with the Lightning Shadow Sword, but this was the Huang Clan and no one dared to provoke the Huang Clan’s patriarch.

When Lin Yun came out, Lil’ purple and Lil’ Red landed beside him and said, “Lin Yun, someone’s here.”

“I know.” He could see many people flying around in the sky of the Huang Clan. The Dragon Pulse Realm experts had started a fight with the Huang Clan’s patriarch, and all of the Huang Clan’s Elysium Core Realm experts had also moved out.

The Huang Clan was a complete mess as battles broke out everywhere. When Lin Yun turned to look at Luo Hua’s courtyard, his face became cold because he could sense three powerful Elysium Core Realm experts over there.

At the same time, a lesser Elysium Core Realm expert landed on Lin Yun’s courtyard. This made Lin Yun feel like he was underestimated. Perhaps these people only wanted to probe Luo Hua’s strength.

“Empress, go with Lil’ Red to save people,” said Lin Yun calmly.

“W-What about you?” Lil’ Purple naturally knew who Lin Yun was talking about, but she wasn’t too willing to go.

“I’ll have some fun with him,” said Lin Yun while he looked at the black-clothed person before him. It was really exciting for him to face an Elysium Core Realm expert after reaching the Empyrean Realm.
