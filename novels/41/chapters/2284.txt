Chapter 2285 - Dead

The Ming Cult, Heavenly Flame Sect, and Myriad Lightning Sect were gathered together, heading towards the Flame Dragon River. They might have escaped, but all of them looked fine and well. With three fourth-stage Saint Lords and three Sovereign Saint Artifacts, everyone from the three holy lands made it out alive.

Furthermore, their harvest could be considered great, aside from not obtaining the divine flame fragment and Divine Blood Fruit. Just the Blood Flame King’s treasures alone were unimaginable. If Lin Yun and everyone in the Flame Dragon Valley died, they would probably become the biggest winners. But none of them could smile at this moment.

After escaping from the Flame Dragon Valley, they watched from afar and knew the outcome. Not long ago, they saw Lin Yun and the Divine Phoenix Mountain riding the Flame Dragon’s skull, which further verified the outcome. Lin Yun was alive, and everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain was also alive. There was also a high chance that they had obtained the divine flame fragment.

“After this incident, Lin Yun’s fame will spread throughout the Kunlun Realm, becoming a powerhouse.”

“He will become a formidable figure when he grows up and has already risen.”

“Belonging to the Radiant’s lineage means he has an inheritance.”

“Even if the Radiant Sword Saint falls, Lin Yun will become the next Radiant Sword Saint in the future or even surpass him,” the three Saint Lords were discussing amongst themselves. Coincidentally, they shared the same thoughts about the situation in the Eastern Desolation.

“He has become a variable,” the Indigo Brave Saint Lord said with a grave expression.

“So what? Since he dared to kill the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord of my sect, we will settle this score with him sooner or later,” the Crow Show Saint Lord said coldly. The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord might not be a holy son, but he was a monstrous genius of the Myriad Lightning Sect.

Hearing what the Crow Shot Saint Lord said, Huang Jingyu wore an eerie smile, “Well said. So what if he had become a variable? Tian Xuanzi is also a variable, not to mention that he hasn’t reached the Saint Realm. So what if he reaches the Saint Realm? Tian Xuanzi is someone who can become an Emperor. If he kills the Radiant Sword Saint and seizes his fortune, Tian Xuanzi can become an Emperor quickly!”

Huang Jingyu’s lip twitched because he was too agitated, which affected the wound on his wrist. His entire hand was severed, but this wasn’t fatal to a Saint. However, the lingering sword intent was too troublesome to deal with, and he had to return to the Ming Cult to heal his injury. So he wasn’t in a hurry with his injury but felt heartache for the Moonlight Sacred Ring instead since it was a powerful treasure.

“We should’ve made a move earlier!” The Crow Shot Saint Lord said, gritting his teeth.

Huang Jingyu shook his head and said, “He has already grown up. We can do nothing to him in the Heavenly Void. We can only try to kill him outside or make him pay the price.”

Huang Jingyu’s eyes were filled with ferocity, with his anger being suppressed.

Liu Yunlan merely glanced at Huang Jingyu and said nothing.

Seeing this, Huang Jingyu said, “Liu Yunlan, why aren’t you saying anything? Aren’t you unhappy about your blade being snapped? Are you not furious even though the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord was your best friend?”

Liu Yunlan replied, “What is there to be angry about when we lost after the three of us ganged up on him?”

He didn’t feel much of a burden to kill for the divine flame fragment, but he didn’t have the cheek to mention how the three of them were defeated by one person. In his eyes, the Crow Shot Saint Lord was a clown. The three wanted to kill Lin Yun but had one of their own killed by Lin Yun instead, and yet the Crow Shot Saint Lord wanted to share contempt around. Wasn’t that the same as making Lin Yun more famous?

Huang Jingyu knew what Liu Yunlan was thinking and said nothing. He didn’t want to waste his saliva now. He would have plenty of ways to deal with Lin Yun once they were outside the Heavenly Void.

Right then, flute music resounded, which made the huge party stop as they raised their heads. They could see an azure figure playing the flute in front of them. When Liu Yunlan saw this person, he frowned, “It’s him!”

They couldn’t clearly see the appearance of this person, but there was no one it could be aside from Lin Yun.

“Flower Burial!” Everyone’s faces changed when they recognized Lin Yun and had lingering fear in their eyes.

The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord snorted, “Flower Burial, why don’t you come closer since you’re already here? There’s no need for you to hide yourself.”

He signalled the Crow Shot Saint Lord and Indigo Brave Saint Lord as he spoke. No matter what Lin Yun was here for, they would bring out their Sovereign Saint Artifacts if he dared to get close. The three of them were heavily injured and had exhausted their saint energy to travel, so they wouldn’t be able to gain any advantage if they attacked Lin Yun. But if Lin Yun dared to come close, it would give them an opportunity.

Huang Jingyu’s face changed as he took a few steps back to hide behind several Saint Elders with an eerie expression.

“Okay.” Lin Yun spread his arms and soared to the sky before descending a thousand feet towards the group.

“Why don’t you come closer?” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord said coldly. Lin Yun was still too far, making it difficult to inflict heavy injuries on him.

“There’s no need. I’m afraid that you guys won’t be able to hold back if I take a few more steps forth,” Lin Yun smiled.

“You’re smart, but what are you doing here? If you want to talk, return the Moonlight Sacred Ring, or there’s nothing for us to talk about,” the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord said coldly.

Since Lin Yun wasn’t willing to come closer, he probably wasn’t here to fight but to negotiate. Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind as he wore a smile that made him look amicable, and this made everyone heave a sigh in relief as they became prideful. So what if Flower Burial was famous? The moment they left the Heavenly Void, each of the three holy lands had a Great Saint around, so it was too late for Lin Yun to beg for mercy now.

As he looked at Lin Yun, Huang Jingyu’s face was cold with disdain.

“I’m here to kill.” Lin Yun smiled as he reached out to his chest. The Flower Burial Sword flew out as a thunderstorm roared and illuminated Lin Yun’s face in the darkness. When the Flower Burial Sword was fully drawn out, Lin Yun’s sword aura reached a terrifying speed and Huang Jingyu fell to his knees the next moment with blood dripping down his lips.

All the Saint Elders were so shocked that their jaws nearly dropped. Right then, a sword shuttled across Huang Jingyu’s head, then plunged into his forehead. The latter might seem fine outside, but he was already dead.

“Young Master!” Everyone from the Ming Cult roared after coming to their senses. Even the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord was so scared that he trembled when he turned around. Everything happened too quickly because the Flower Burial Sword flew out when Lin Yun finished speaking. That's why, when the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord turned around, Huang Jingyu was already dead.

They didn’t have the luxury of being dumbfounded. The four glory spirits on the Flower Burial Sword were then activated, blowing Huang Jingyu into pieces.

Liu Yunlan reacted swiftly but could only shut his eyes before his face was covered in blood.

The Indigo Brave Saint Lord and Crow Shot Saint Lord reacted the fastest and instantly took out their Sovereign Saint Artifacts. But Lin Yun seemed to have expected this and flicked his two hands, unleashing sword rays that sent the two Saint Lords flying away. His attack wasn’t fatal, but there were too many sword rays. The two Saint Lords could only do their best to protect themselves.

When all the sword rays shattered, Lin Yun soared to the sky and stood on the Flower Burial Sword, flying away like an immortal as he left.

“Chase after him! Why aren’t you guys moving?!” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord came to his senses and roared at the Indigo Brave Saint Lord and Crow Shot Saint Lord.

The Crow Shot Saint Lord’s face flushed, but was too embarrassed to open his mouth. Lin Yun clearly came prepared and had already left when they came to their senses. Most importantly, Lin Yun faced them even when he left, and his gaze was too terrifying.

The Indigo Brave Saint Lord took a deep breath before he held onto the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord. He said, “Don’t bother chasing after him. If he goes to the Fallen God Valley again, do you have the courage to jump down?”

The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord calmed down upon hearing that and was dumbfounded. He naturally wouldn’t dare to jump down the Fallen God Valley again. Even the Sovereign Saint Artifact couldn’t withstand the pressure in the Fallen God Valley and he would have died there if it wasn’t for the Indigo Brave Saint Lord.

The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord fell to his knees, and wailed, “He always ruins my reputation! With the young master dead, how will I explain it to the master?!”

He was furious, but there was nothing he could do about it.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Liu Yunlan wiped the blood off his face and looked at the ground with a hint of mockery. Huang Jingyu planned so much and wanted to settle the score with Lin Yun again after leaving the God Burial Mountain Range, but he probably never expected that Lin Yun had no intentions of letting him go.

Liu Yunlan didn’t know what to say, but he recalled what Huang Jingyu said when he saw that Lin Yun was about to be killed by the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. He waved his hand and said, “Rest in peace.”

After he said that, it felt as though he placed down a huge burden.
