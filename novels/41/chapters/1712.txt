Chapter 1713 – Xiahou Feng, Xin Wuhen

This banquet was simple yet grand,with all of the seats being filled. The main table was at the highest position, and there were two rows of guest tables on the left and right of the main table. The outer region was meant for musicians and other special guests. Aside from that, some exquisite fake mountains were converted into guest tables.

The main table naturally belonged to the Wind Edge Lord. Those on the left and right were ranked according to their strengths, with the stronger seated closer to the main table.

The West Garden was close to a lake, and the lake contained the saint vein of the Liu Saint Clan. The banquet was held beside the lake, and many beautiful ladies were dancing in the center before the banquet began. Right then, the butler of the Liu Saint Clan led the Orchid Creek Valley’s party to a remote corner.

“Who is he?” A blue-robed youth suddenly walked over and looked at Lin Yun with his brows furrowed. This person was extraordinary, and Lin Yun could sense powerful mental energy from him before they even got close to each other.

When Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto the fingers of this youth, he was surprised because his hands were a little terrifying. If he used this pair of hands to play the zither, it would surely be terrifying. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But before Lin Yun could speak, Yun Xi explained on his behalf, “Senior Brother, this is Lil’ Lin. He just joined us recently.”

The blue-robed youth glanced at Lin Yun before he said, “Then, look after him and ensure nothing happens. The Wind Edge Lord gathered the geniuses from today's various musical houses, wanting to drag the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion down. I want to go to the Nirvana Banquet, so ensure that he does not ruin it.”

“Hehe. It’ll be fine. Who doesn’t know that Senior Brother’s zither is the strongest of the city’s west, and no one in the same generation can compete with you?” Yun Xi chuckled.

When the blue-robed youth heard what Yun Xi said, a smile appeared on his lips. As a musician, he naturally wanted to participate in the Nirvana Banquet, but the quotas were in the hands of the Four Musical Houses. The other musical houses were fine, but the Heavenly Fragrance pavilion had declined, but they’re still not giving up on their quotas. He couldn’t accept this, and the other musical houses in the Vermillion Bird District shared the same thoughts.

While the blue-robed youth was chatting, he was dragged away by the Wind Edge Lord, letting the blue-robed youth sit on a table closer to the main table. This signified that Wind Edge Lord held great hope for the blue-robed youth.

“Who is he?” Lin Yun asked.

“He’s Senior Brother Kong Ying. Hahaha, you’re really a newcomer. You don’t even recognize our chief disciple.” Yun Xi chuckled.

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled because he nearly gave it away earlier. But it was fortunate that Yun Xi was innocent, since anyone else would’ve started suspecting his identity.

While the two were chatting, an elegant figure walked into the West Garden. This person was young, but he gave off a prestigious aura. Not only did he possess a prestigious and amicable aura, but his gaze was also filled with charm. “Wind Edge Lord!”

When he came, everyone quickly cupped their hands together. This person was handsome, and he said, “Hahaha! Wind Edge Lord, it has been a long time!”

When the Wind Edge Lord raised his head, he smiled, “Brother Huang!”

“It’s actually the representative from the Ming Cult. He’s more handsome than the rumors stated.” Yun Xi’s eyes were shining when she looked at this person, which went the same for the other women of the Orchid Creek Valley. Their faces had turned red with excitement.

“He’s handsome?” Lin Yun smiled.

Yun Xi’s eyes shone with admiration. “That person is Huang Xuanyi, who was ranked first on the Elysium Core Ranking for a long time. Who doesn’t know about him in Eastern Desolation? Not to mention that he’s also from the holy land and famous even after he made it into the Dragon Pulse Ranking. He will definitely grow into an influential figure like the Wind Edge Lord.”

Lin Yun had long paid attention to this person, but he never expected that someone he had blinded back then would recover his vision. The Ming Cult was genuinely worthy of being a holy land, and they probably had quite a few Saints with extraordinary medical skills.

Compared to when they last met, Huang Xuanyi was graceful while he was chatting with Wind Edge Lord. After all, he was the genius of the holy land, and the influence of the six holy lands was stronger than the Ancient Barren Domain’s eight powerful sects.

In the past, the Sword Sect was also a holy land. Over the past three thousand years, the Sword Sect had been working hard to bring the Sword Sect back to being a holy land, and god knows how many people sacrificed their lives because of it.

Just thinking about it, Lin Yun’s mood dwindled, and he wondered how his master was now. If it weren’t for Tian Xuanzi, his master would have probably reached the Emperor Realm, and he also wouldn’t have had to go into hiding.

“Lil’ Lin, what’s the matter?” Yun Xi asked when she noticed Lin Yun’s expression didn’t look good.

“I’m fine.” Lin Yun smiled when he came to his senses.

“How are you fine? The cup in your hand has been crushed…” Yun Xi said, pointing at Lin Yun’s hand.

Placing the cup down, Lin Yun smiled, “I once met Huang Xuanyi. I was present when Flower Burial defeated him. So I can’t help feeling a little emotional.”

“Flower Burial? Wow, you actually met Flower Burial?” Yun Xi’s tone was filled with envy when she looked at Lin Yun again.

Lin Yun smiled upon hearing that because he didn’t expect Yun Xi would be his fan girl.

“How is Flower Burial compared to Huang Xuanyi?” Lin Yun asked with a smile.

“Flower Burial is definitely more dashing.”

“What about Lin Xiao?”

“Don’t mention him. He’s definitely not a good person to even bully a girl. Big Sister Lan is such a good person, but he was actually so ruthless towards her.” Yun Xi’s cheeks puffed up, and she continued, “If he’s standing in front of me, I would surely return him the three slaps.”

“I don’t think you will have that courage.” Lin Yun smiled.

As Yun Xi blushed, she shyly said, “Why wouldn’t I dare? I-I-I will definitely dare to return him the three slaps!”

“Hahaha! It’s fine. If he dares to come, I’ll make him let you slap him three times.” Lin Yun couldn’t help teasing Yun Xi upon seeing how adorable she was.

“Hmph, keep boasting.” Yun Xi snorted.

“Wind Edge Lord!” More people came forth to greet the Wind Edge Lord. A group came with a man and a woman leading the party.

When Lin Yun glanced at this party, he couldn’t help smiling because they were people he knew. They were Xu Dongfei and Lan Hongyan of the Exquisite Court.

“Brother Xu, it has been long since we last met.” The Wind Edge Lord abandoned everyone else and came forth to greet Xu Dongfei. He didn’t mistreat Xu Dongfei because of his failure in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. On the contrary, he was polite and passionate as he smiled, “How are your injuries? Are you alright?”

“With the saint elixirs from you, I have long recovered from my injuries.” Xu Dongfei said.

“That’s a piece of good news. We’ll talk again when the banquet ends. I collected some incomplete scores recently, and I’ll need Brother Xu to give me some comments on them.” The Wind Edge Lord elegantly smiled.

This made Xu Dongfei feel flattered. The other guests also nodded their heads and felt that no one could compete with the Wind Edge Lord in terms of manners.

After Xu Dongfei and Lan Hongyan sat down, the Wind Edge Lord received the other guests. Most of the guests were musicians, and all the famous musicians from the Vermillion Bird District were here.

Even someone like Xu Dongfei, who possessed the pinnacle of Noble Tone, couldn’t stand out here and could only be considered first-rate amongst everyone here.

“Jiang Yu is here!” A voice resounded, making the Wind Edge Lord’s eyes light up. He stepped forth and smiled, “Uncle Jiang, you’ve finally come after so many invites!”

All the guests were alarmed, and they quickly turned their attention over. Everyone here knew the objective of the West Garden Banquet. This banquet was aimed to gather all the musicians in the Vermillion Bird District to replace the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s position as one of the Four Musical Houses.

Jiang Yu was the Grand Elder of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s Law Enforcement Hall. So they naturally would be shocked that Jiang Yu would attend the banquet.

“I have to thank Wind Edge Lord that my son’s injuries have been healed. So I have to come, emotionally or rationally.” Jiang Yu laughed, and he was in a good mood. Beside him, Jiang Feng had wholly recovered from his injuries, even though his complexion was still pale.

“It’s just a small matter. Uncle Jiang, please sit down.” The Wind Edge Lord smiled as he led Jiang Yu and Jiang Feng to their table.

Suddenly, an uproar broke out from the surroundings, with everyone shocked, looking at the entrance as two people walked in. The two were handsome and captivated everyone’s attention just by walking in.

“Xiahou Feng and Xin Wuhen!”

“Those two are actually here? The Wind Edge Lord’s face is really huge for them to come.”

“It looks like this West Garden Banquet will be interesting!” Everyone’s emotions were high, with excitement on their faces.
