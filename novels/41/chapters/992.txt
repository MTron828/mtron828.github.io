Chapter 993 - It’s Against Etiquette Not To Reciprocate

When Jiang Ling heard Lin Yun’s words and saw the latter’s fighting spirit, he suddenly recalled a time when he was young. Back then, he was a prideful genius just like Lin Yun who dared to talk back to seniors.

During that time, Jiang Ling had many companions that stood by his side. It was a sorrowful era, but it also made his blood boil. But when the tribulation arrived, geniuses appeared one by one to face the danger. Naturally, he began to wonder if someone would stand up from this era when the next tribulation came.

Jiang Ling was briefly stunned before he smiled, “Interesting. I’m starting to like you. But since this is a test, I won’t go easy on you. Witness my strength!”

When he finished, a boundless aura exploded out of Jiang Ling’s body as the aura of an azure dragon appeared. Lin Yun was surprised because he had also grasped the azure dragon aura, but his was combined with his sword aura. Although, there was a huge gap between his and Jiang Ling’s.

Lin Yun was also shocked that Jiang Ling restricted his cultivation in the initial second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Then, Jiang Ling pushed his palm out and an azure dragon’s head flew out, “Young lad, don’t lose! Azure Dragon Grab!”

With a roar, the azure dragon head and a black claw descended towards Lin Yun. When the dragon claw appeared, Lin Yun’s face changed drastically. He was shocked to discover that his surroundings were restricted by lightning as if the powerful claw was enveloping him.

“Not good!” Lin Yun squinted his eyes because he was shocked to discover that he couldn’t control his body as his body flew towards the dragon. He could see a vortex made of boundless lightning pulling him in. No matter how he struggled, he couldn’t break free.

“Come here!” A roar echoed in Lin Yun’s ears, which caused turbulence in Lin Yun’s body. WIth his origin energy disrupted, he spit up a mouthful of blood.

When he flew towards the claw uncontrollably, he discovered that the surrounding space was compressing him and causing his bones to crack. Lin was overwhelmed because he knew that the pressure could only come from the dragon claw.

Wounds began to appear on Lin Yun’s body even though he strengthened his body during the test. Without the increase in strength, he would be bleeding from his orifices and his bones would be broken by now.

This is only the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm? Lin Yun was shocked because Jiang Ling was even stronger than Mu Xiuhan, who was in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. But before he could think more about it, Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood as his vision became dark.

He could tell that he would be torn apart by the dragon claw if he didn’t think of something. If that happened, he wouldn’t be able to escape. But whenever he thought about the playful gaze from Jiang Ling, fighting spirits boiled in the depth of his heart. He knew that Jiang Ling might spare him at the last moment, but he couldn’t stand that playful gaze from Jiang Ling.

Enduring the immense pressure, Lin Yun brought out his sky sword intent and the Divine Sun Breaking Seal with the golden crow seal. He resorted to a punch since there wasn’t enough time to draw his sword.

“Sword and fist combine! Divine Sun Breaking Seal!” When Lin Yun made a fist, his boundless sword aura manifested into a dragon. Instantly, he combined his sky sword intent, azure dragon sword aura, and Divine Sun Breaking Seal.

As Lin Yun’s cold voice sounded out, fine cracks began to appear on the dragon claw followed by a dazzling golden brilliance. When Lin Yun’s sword buzz echoed out and formed a sword, Jiang Ling expressed his surprise, “Sky sword intent?”

At the same time, he discovered that it was a fist and not a sword. Looking at this scene, a smile rose on his lips because he could tell that Lin Yun’s punch wasn’t simple. “Fist and sword combined? Interesting…”

“It’s against etiquette not to reciprocate a gift. Senior, take this sword of mine!” Just when Jiang Ling was about to congratulate Lin Yun for making it through the test, Lin Yun’s dazzling sword intent soared into the sky.

Then, Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips and grabbed onto his sword. There was no way that Lin Yun could accept his miserable state when Jiang Ling used the same cultivation as him.

“Three Heavenly Divides — Azure Lotus!” When Lin Yun swung his sword out, the Azure Firmament Tree enveloped the entire sky with countless petals that descended like stars. As the stars landed on the pond, enchanting lotuses were quickly created.

At first, Jiang Ling wasn’t bothered by Lin Yun’s outburst. But when he saw the manifestation of Lin Yun’s attack blossoming, he became serious. Immediately, Jiang Ling brought his cultivation to the pinnacle fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm and grabbed onto the attack. However, he was forced to take a step back in order to stabilize himself.

Lin Yun smiled at this scene. Even though he suffered a loss, he still managed to force Jiang Ling to push his cultivation beyond the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

“Senior, sorry about that.” Lin Yun smiled after sheathing his sword and then cupped his hands together.

“Brat, you’re taking advantage of the fact that I don’t have a physique!” Jiang Ling grabbed onto the sword ray with a powerful strength coming from his hand and looked at Lin Yun with ill intent.

Looking at Jiang Ling’s expression, Lin Yun became speechless. He suddenly realized that he took it too far. When he looked at Jiang Ling’s clenched fists, he raised his guard. After all, Jiang Ling could return an attack out of anger.

In the end, Lin Yun decided to bow and smiled, “Haha, how would I dare to take advantage of you. I was just sparring with you. If you still had your physique, I wouldn’t dare to fight with you.”

“At least you’re tactful.” Jiang Ling’s expression eased up and his fists loosened up. Then, countless lightning gathered in his hand before soaring into the sky in the form of a sword ray.

“What?” Lin Yun’s eyes bulged out of his head. Jiang Ling reduced his strongest attack into lightning and threw it away. Based on his estimation, Jiang Ling could entirely grasp the intent within his attack and return it to him.

“There are still many things you’re unaware about.” Jiang Ling smiled. In reality, he wasn’t truly enraged by what Lin Yun did, but he couldn’t let Lin Yun embarrass him. Although he was only a remnant soul, he had never suffered such a huge loss in the hands of a junior. Clearly, Lin Yun’s performance proved that he finally had a suitable successor.

“Brat, stop looking around.” Jiang Ling waved his hand and the surrounding phenomena disappeared. When he looked at Lin Yun again, he smiled, “It’s time for me to give you the opportunity above fortune and for you to fulfill this last wish of mine.”

When Lin Yun heard that, he was greatly shocked. He was finally going to obtain the opportunity above fortune.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
