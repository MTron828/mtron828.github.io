Chapter 2267 - Phoenix Doesn't Worship The Dragon

The center of the Flame Dragon Valley was located at the skull of the Flame Dragon’s skeleton remains. This was an ancient ruin that looked small from the outside. But after standing in it, they started to realize that this place was very spacious. The Flame Dragon’s skull that looked close was gigantic, close to a thousand meters.

The ruins were filled with erected stone pillars that were emitting a chilling aura that prevented anyone from getting close.

“It’s cold.” Li Feibai, who followed the group, muttered softly.

Lin Yun sensed the chill and raised his head to see a black stone monument. After he sensed this unusual stone monument, he said, “This stone monument contains great yin energy.”

“That’s not a stone monument but a block of ice. It’s a block of the Ancient Frost Ice that had been placed here on purpose by someone,” Ji Zixi said.

“It’s hard for the divine flames to exist long after a god’s death. So maybe the reason why the divine flames exist is due to this Ancient Frost Ice?” Lin Yun asked.

“Most likely,” the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s old man said.

“Senior, what do you think?” Lin Yun asked.

Ji Xinghe, the Astral River Saint Lord, smiled, “I dare not claim to be Senior in front of you. You’re the direct disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, and your seniority might not be any lower than mine. After all, my master can be considered from the same generation as the Radiant Sword Saint.”

Lin Yun rubbed his nose, and smiled, “Senior, you must be joking. You’re not an ordinary Saint Lord. I addressed you as a senior not because of your seniority but strength.”

The Astral River Saint Lord’s eyes lit up, and he sent a more pleasant look at Lin Yun. Even Ji Zixi was briefly surprised before she smiled. Lin Yun was right; the old man was mysterious, not an ordinary Saint Lord.

“Senior, stop beating around the bush. What do you think of the divine flame fragment?” Li Feibai asked with a smile.

But the old man gave an unfriendly look at Li Feibai, before he said, “Lady, don’t think that I can’t guess your identity just because you’re wearing a mask.”

Li Feibai smiled upon hearing that. She recalled what Lin Yun said and smiled, “The mask is for gentlemen, not villains. If you say it out loud, you’re a villain.”

The Astral River Saint Lord was briefly stunned before he smiled and looked at Lin Yun, “This should have been placed by the Annihilation God Lord before his death. This should be the inheritance that the Annihilation God Lord had left behind before his death. The Flame Dragon should have been the Annihilation God Lord’s pet when it was still alive and had been guarding this place after the Annihilation God Lord’s death to prevent the inheritance from being stolen. But it’s a pity that the Flame Dragon died of old age, and the legacy still hasn’t found an heir.”

Lin Yun raised his head to look at the Flame Dragon’s skeleton and said, “But it has prevented the divine flame from falling into the wrong hands. A gentleman’s promise was kept for the rest of its life.”

The Astral River Saint Lord was briefly stunned because she didn’t expect that from Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun raised his head to look at the Flame Dragon’s skeleton, his heart was filled with respect for this deceased Flame Dragon. The Flame Dragon had used its life to fulfil its promise, preventing the inheritance from falling into the wrong hands.

“Aren’t you a little too serious about this? Even if it was noble when it was alive, it is only a pile of bones now,” Qu Wushuang said.

“Perhaps.” Lin Yun smiled. He then turned to the other holy lands and asked, “Can I take a look at the stone monument first?”

The elders from the various holy lands were stunned, not knowing why Lin Yun wanted to observe the stone monument. Even if Flower Burial was strong, how could he steal the divine flames before their eyes?

Lin Yun knew what these people were thinking and smiled, “Since no one has any opinion about it, I’ll head over now.”

Ji Zixi followed behind Lin Yun. When everyone came to their senses, Lin Yun was already far away.

“Let me see what he’s trying to do.” Huang Jingyu furiously crossed his sleeves, watching Ji Zixi as she followed Lin Yun.

Li Feibai smiled, but she didn’t interrupt. She turned to the Astral River Saint Lord and smiled, “Senior, they look pretty compatible.”

They naturally looked compatible. One looked elegant, like an immortal, while the other looked gorgeous. But her words made the blood pressure of Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Saint Elders rise since they couldn’t allow their little princess to be abducted by others.

The Astral River Saint Lord’s brow jumped, and he angrily said, “Silence!”

“Hehe, but I’m just speaking of the truth,” Li Feibai chuckled.

The Astral River Saint Lord pretended not to hear what Li Feibai said, but he was alert.

In the ruins, Ji Zixi curiously asked, “Lin Yun, how were you able to come out of the Fallen God Valley? Uncle Xinghe said it’s a forbidden ground that is dangerous even with a Sovereign Saint Artifact, not to mention getting back out.”

“I flew back up, but the situation was a little complicated. So I can’t bring you down; otherwise, you’ll know what’s going on,” Lin Yun replied, staring at the stone monument.

“There’s an opportunity at the bottom of the Fallen God Valley?” Ji Zixi asked curiously.

“There’s no opportunities, but there’s a wife,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Continue lying!” Ji Zixi replied furiously.

Lin Yun smiled and raised his head, “Do I look like someone who would lie?”

“There’s really a wife down there?” Ji Zixi asked, stumped.

“Yeah,” Lin Yun nodded.

Ji Zixi was briefly distracted. It was originally a joke, but she was speechless after looking at the serious expression on Lin Yun’s face.

Lin Yun didn’t pay attention to Ji Zixi’s face; his gaze was on the stone monument. The stone monument was smooth without a speck of dust on it. After reaching out to touch it, Lin Yun immediately shivered. He could feel his blood beating violently with his blood boiling.

When he raised his head, he just happened to be looking straight at the Flame Dragon’s skull. In the next second, the Flame Dragon looked like it had come to life. The Flame Dragon might’ve died, but its spirit still exists. Others couldn’t sense it, but Lin Yun could sense it since he possessed the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

“Lin Yun, are you alright?” Ji Zixi asked as she quickly shifted Lin Yun’s hand away.

Lin Yun came to his senses and smiled, “I’m fine. I was only lost in thought. This stone monument may not be the Ancient Frost Ice.”

“What is it, then?” Ji Zixi asked.

“Dragon’s blood, the heart’s blood of this Ancient Flame Dragon,” Lin Yun said.

“But how could the blood be so cold?” Ji Zixi asked doubtfully.

Lin Yun looked at the ruins and said, “Maybe the chill came from the divine flames.”

Ji Zixi briefly pondered, then figured it out. Flames could be divided into Yin and Yang, and it would be normal for flames to contain great yin energy if it was yin-attributed flames. She asked, “But… what’s the point of that?”

What could Lin Yun do even if he knew it was dragon’s blood? They still had to melt the blood to release the divine flame.

“Zhao Tianyu and the Ying River King are here to gather information. The real trouble is beyond that,” Lin Yun said as he stood up. “I just want to see if there’s a way to deal with the trouble.”

“The Ying River King is a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit?” Ji Zixi asked.

Lin Yun nodded in response, making Ji Zixi’s facial expression grave. What would the real trouble be if a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit was only the first wave? She initially thought that as long as she released the restriction on the divine flames, she would be able to deal with all the troubles with the trump cards of the Divine Phoenix Mountain. Not to mention that the five holy lands have now joined forces together.

But after hearing what Lin Yun said, she instantly lost her confidence. While she was pondering, Lin Yun clasped his hands together and prayed in the direction of the Flame Dragon’s skull.

“This fellow knows how to act,” Huang Jingyu said with disdain.

“It’s just a pile of bones, so what is he doing?”

“Maybe he’s addicted to acting.”

“I thought he discovered something after spending so much time, but he’s just praying towards the bones.” After Huang Jingyu spoke out, the three other holy lands also expressed dissatisfaction with Lin Yun. Not only them, but even those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain couldn’t comprehend what Lin Yun was trying to do.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“What is that fellow doing?” Li Feibai was baffled. She turned to the Astral River Saint Lord and asked, “Should we pray as well?”

“A phoenix doesn’t worship a dragon,” the Astral River Saint Lord said. But after he said that, Ji Zixi began to pray towards the Flame Dragon’s skull.

This naturally made Li Feibai laugh, and she said, “This is called following the one you married. Now, even a phoenix has to worship a dragon.”

Everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain nearly threw out a mouthful of blood. They would’ve chased Li Feibai away if the Astral River Saint Lord hadn’t stopped them.

In the ruins, Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling as he looked at Ji Zixi, who was only seventeen or eighteen. She was still a little girl. She looked pretty adorable when she was praying towards the Flame Dragon’s remains. He smiled, “You’re a phoenix, but you want to worship a dragon?”

Ji Zixi blushed, which made her look even more adorable. She softly said, “You prayed, so there’s naturally nothing wrong with me following you. What’s the matter? D-Did I do something wrong?”

“Well, you’re not wrong,” Lin Yun smiled and left the ruins. When they rejoined the group, the faces of those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain were dark before the Astral River Saint Lord stepped between Ji Zixi and Lin Yun, separating them.

“Flower Burial, have you discovered anything?” The Astral River Saint Lord said. His words attracted the attention of the other holy lands as well.

“Nothing,” Lin Yun shook his head.

Everyone was disappointed when they heard that, but that was also within their expectations. After all, they were here for so long and it would be embarrassing if Lin Yun managed to discover something.

“Let’s stop wasting time, then. Let’s have the little princess make a move.” Huang Jingyu caressed the Sacred Moonlight Ring in his hand and led everyone over.

Ji Zixi was unhappy, but she followed him after seeing Lin Yun nodding his head. This was naturally captured in Li Feibai’s eyes, who gave the Astral River Saint Lord a wink to signify that what she said was right.

When he saw that, the Astral River Saint Lord could feel his blood boiling; he would’ve given her a beating if Li Feibai didn’t have a huge background.
