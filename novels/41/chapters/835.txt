Chapter 836 - Shocking Everyone

The dazzling appearance of Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent shocked everyone. At this moment, everyone’s breathing became heavy. From the Sacred Alliance to the sects, not a single group was able to keep their cool.

After the spectators recovered from their shock, they yelled at the top of their lungs. “Holy shit! Is this real? That’s Spiritual sword intent!”

“Quasi-spiritual sword intent and spiritual sword intent might sound pretty close, but the actual difference between them is night and day. The gap is even bigger than someone in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm and the Heavenly Soul Realm…”

“No, there’s no way the two can be compared. There are a few Heavenly Soul Realm experts, but there are only two or three people who have grasped the spiritual sword intent in the entire Profound Amber Realm. Furthermore, they are monsters in the quasi-Empyrean Realm. No one has ever grasped the spiritual sword intent before reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm.”

“This is too unbelievable. Lin Yun actually grasped the spiritual sword intent! No wonder he dares to face Yu Haotian. He really has the qualifications to fight Yu Haotian. He’s definitely the first genius with spiritual sword intent in the history of the banquet.” No one could describe the shock that Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent brought.

“His talent in the sword path is really terrifying.” Nangong Wanyu became dazed. He was shocked to discover that his frost sword intent was trembling in fear when he looked at Lin Yun.

As for Mu Han, he was completely dumbfounded. He couldn’t believe that Lin Yun actually grasped the spiritual sword intent. If Lin Yun had fought him with spiritual sword intent, he would have lost in less than three moves.

After all, a swordsman with spiritual sword intent could easily suppress other geniuses.

“The outcome is really uncertain now. Yu Haotian is terrifying since he’s in the Heavenly Soul Realm, but Lin Yun grasped the spiritual sword intent…”

“It won’t be easy for Lin Yun to win though. There’s a huge difference between the Heavenly Soul Realm and quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm.”

“Everything will depend on how powerful Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent is. This fight has become really interesting.” The judges started to discuss their opinions after seeing Lin Yun’s surprise.

After bringing out his spiritual sword intent, Lin Yun felt less pressure. Up to this point, Lin Yun hadn’t fought with all of his strength. Since he kept suppressing his strength, it felt like he was fighting with his hand behind his back.

Lin Yun was excited that he could finally fight with all of his strength. Empowered by his spiritual sword intent, Lin Yun’s aura reached a terrifying level and he began to spread his sword intent into the sky. Before Lin Yun’s sword intent even reached Yu Haotian, the latter’s aura was riddled with holes.

“Spiritual sword intent!” Yu Haotian was surprised and his face turned nasty. Clearly, he had miscalculated things. “So what if your sword intent is at the spiritual sword intent? You have no idea how powerful the Overlord Fist is at the Heavenly Soul Realm level!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Then show me,” replied Lin Yun. He didn’t waste his time talking to Yu Haotian and prepared his attack.

“Heavenly Earth Overlord Art—Terranean Dominance!” Yu Haotian attacked with the second form of the Overlord Fist. As he threw his punch, the surrounding was instantly destroyed. Although Yu Haotian’s figure wasn’t robust, he still attacked with the might of a king.

“You’re still nothing before me!” yelled Yu Haotian.

Lin Yun’s thoughts flashed swiftly in his mind before he made a decision. He knew that he would be in a disadvantageous position if he clashed with Yu Haotian using the Overlord Sword. “Where do the flowers bloom!”

In that split second, a flower bloomed in the depths of Lin Yun’s eyes. In the next second, a gorgeous rose appeared on the tip of his sword. When the rose bloomed, the surroundings seemed to have lost its luster.

Then, Lin Yun’s sword clashed with Yu Haotian’s fist. The collision created cracks on the stage as rubble slowly rose off the ground. It was as if time had frozen still under Lin Yun and Yu Haotian’s aura. Then, their aura exploded, causing the debris to fly at light speed.

Tapping his foot in mid-air, Lin Yun drifted a few hundred meters away.

“What powerful origin energy.” Lin Yun wore a grave expression because Yu Haotian’s origin energy had undergone a transformation after reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm. Although Yu Haotian wasn’t even in the first soul, the transformation still gave him a huge advantage in the fight.

The Overlord Fist was a high graded martial technique that was hard to unleash in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. However, after reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm, Yu Haotian could unleash the full power of the Overlord Fist. He could even pair it with the Heavenly Earth Overlord Art.

At this moment, Lin Yun was rejoicing at the fact that he didn’t use the Overlord Sword. After all, his Dustlight Sword Art was a lot stronger than his Overlord Sword. If he had used his Overlord Sword, it would have been suppressed before Yu Haotian’s complete Overlord Fist. But even so, Lin Yun was still sent flying over a hundred meters.

“Interesting.” Yu Haotian smiled with an intense look in his eyes. “You actually have another sword technique. But it doesn’t matter. Everything is futile before absolute strength!”

Enveloped in purple, Yu Haotian appeared before Lin Yun and threw a punch. The crowd gasped because Yu Haotian showed no signs that he was about to attack.

Where do I come from!

Yu Haotian might be fast, but Lin Yun was faster. Lin Yun disappeared when Yu Haotian’s punch reached him. In fact, Lin Yun left no traces of his spiritual sword intent or Azure Dragon Sword Aura. It was as if Lin Yun never existed. The only thing he left behind was a broken rose that turned into a violent storm.

The petals from the rose started to collide, creating torrential sword rays that pierced the clouds in the sky. The spiritual sword intent created a phenomenon of starlight that peered through the broken clouds.

The endless mountain and lake; the crisping leaves and wind!

In the next second, Yu Haotian was sent flying as sword rays collided with his purple glow. Before Yu Haotian landed on the ground, another sword ray slashed down at him. Yu Haotian’s face changed at this sight as he threw out a few punches. However, he was still pushed to step backwards.

Lin Yun’s sword aura was too powerful and unbelievable because he actually couldn’t find any flaws.

Drifting flowers like dreams, and sorrow like fine rain!

No one possesses everything in this world, and I shall give the lord a white lily!

Lin Yun’s sword aura changed once more as flower petals drifted down. When the rain fell onto his sword, he unleashed dozens of swords at Yu Haotian. Even with Yu Haotian’s immense origin energy, there was no way he could come out unscathed from the barrage of attacks.

This scene left everyone dumbfounded because they had never seen this sword technique before. This was an imaginative sword technique that couldn’t be followed.

“This isn’t the end! Overlord Fist–Heartless Heaven and Earth!” Yu Haotian flew into a rage and attacked the moment he had an opportunity to. With a ferocious roar, he threw a glowing purple punch that distorted everything in its path.

“Perfect timing!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he summoned a boundless sword aura around him.

I come from heaven!

The flower blooms in my hand!

When Lin Yun descended from the sky and stabbed his sword into the ground. Out of nowhere, a rose appeared on Lin Yun’s palm that began to hover in the air. Once the rose bloomed, Lin Yun’s terrifying spiritual sword intent surged violently.

Under his sword intent, the entire heaven and earth began to tremble violently. The dazzling brilliance that Lin Yun released shocked Yu Haotian. However, he didn’t cower and continued his charge.

“A speck of dust shines through the mountain and river!” Letting out a roar, Lin Yun’s sword aura transformed into a rising sun. When his brilliance reached its apparent limit, it exploded right before Yu Haotian’s punch was about to hit him.

At this moment, all of the spectators held their breath. The battle was truly unbelievable. Not even the elders could believe that this was a fight between two youths.
