Chapter 894 - Higher Realms

The Demonic Soul Fruit was truly a good thing for Lin Yun. At the very least, the effect had far surpassed his expectations. He had cultivated two sword sutras, which allowed him to have more origin energy than those in his realm. He could rely on this advantage to confront those in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

But it would be extremely taxing on his physique. Qin Feng’s physique had been tempered by his Heavenly Soul Realm tribulation while Lin Yun could only rely on his Azure Dragon Battle Physique. So Lin Yun was naturally happy to see that the Demonic Soul Fruit could temper his physique and origin energy.

Compared to the benefits that he could receive, the pain was nothing. Basking in the black flames, the dragon runes on the surface of his body began to squirm. Under the tempering of the black flames, the dragon runes began to release a faint metallic luster.

Under the Demonic Soul Fruit’s tempering, the grime deep in his body was purified. The grime came from the pellets and fruits he had eaten. No matter how he refined them, there was always a trace left behind that became a stain as time passed. So under the tempering of the Demonic Soul Fruit, he was being cleansed.

Suddenly, a dragon roar echoed from Lin Yun’s body. The restriction of his Azure Dragon Enneaform had finally broken. At the same time, a droplet of blood from the Azure Dragon Seal on his chest merged with the dragon runes and gave the purple runes a crimson taint.

Lin Yun was shocked to discover that the dragon runes had perfectly fused into his body like they were his muscles.

“Is this the decaform or is this a new beginning?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he could sense that the Azure Dragon Enneaform had become more profound.

One night passed in the blink of an eye. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his pupils flashed with bright light. When he let out a breath, he felt an indescribable satisfaction. Although it was only one night, it felt like he tempered himself in a cauldron for a decade.

“The effects of the Demonic Soul Fruit are really terrifying. If Chen Xuan knew how beneficial it was to me, he might not be willing to give it to me.” Lin Yun stood up and circulated his origin energy through his meridians. He could hear lightning crackling within his body as he had grown 30% stronger than before.

Lin Yun was speechless because the effect was really unbelievable. However, Lin Yun knew the effects were so strong because this was the first time he had eaten the fruit. If he refined a second one, the effects wouldn’t be as obvious.

Hmmm? Lin Yun suddenly rolled up his sleeves to see dragon runes wandering beneath his skin. The dragon runes looked like blood vessels and gave him a bizarre feeling. When he directed the dragon runes into his arm, he could sense that the strength in his arm had grown to a terrifying height.

“It seems like the dragon runes have perfectly merged with the azure dragon’s strength…” Lin Yun’s heart throbbed with surprise. He initially had over 100 cauldron’s worth of strength, but it had soared frantically overnight.

When the dragon runes moved to his right arm, it felt like he had a dragon’s arm since he had 300 cauldrons worth of strength. Then, the power started to dissipate with a single thought.

He needed strength to wield the Indigoflame Thunderwhip. In the past, it would be challenging for him to wield it as it would fully exhaust his strength. However, he would have a much easier time controlling it now.

At this moment, Qin Feng walked over. It appeared that Qin Feng was grabbing Lin Yun to head deeper into the Flamefeather Mountain.

“Lin Yun, it’s time for us to leave,” said Qin Feng as he felt relief when he saw Lin Yun. With a surprised tone, he asked, “You already refined the Demonic Soul Fruit?”

Lin Yun merely nodded in response, which made Qin Feng take a cold breath. He knew how painful it was to refine the Demonic Soul Fruit. Lin Yun actually refined it in just a single night?

“Let’s go,” said Lin Yun. There was no change in his emotions despite the boost in his strength.

In the next few days, more people began to gather in the Flamefeather Mountain Range. But fortunately, their journey was rather smooth. As more people approached Flamefeather City, they became more reserved to prevent conflicts. Flamefeather City was now a danger zone without the Divine Dragon Statue, so no one was willing to weaken their party before entering the city.

Seven days later, a barren land appeared with a massive ruine in the center. But because of how massive the ruin was, they could only see a part of it. No one could have imagined that the ruins used to be a thriving city in the past. Then, a hot wind blew towards the group.

“This is Flamefeather City?” Lin Yun was shocked in his heart because the scale of this city was simply too massive. However, the damage was even greater than he imagined. Could it be that this city was destroyed in the ancient battle?

The aura coming from this city was even more ancient than Thunderflame City. Compared to Flamefeather City, Thunderflame City seemed pretty new. The ruin before them was a genuine ancient dragon city.

Lin Yun’s guess was correct as cities like Thunderflame City were built after people obtained the Divine Dragon Statues. A genuine ancient dragon city was rare in the Heavenly Path as the battle was so intense back then that even stars had shattered from the fight.

“This place is really terrifying. There’s so much powerful fire energy even before we step into the city.” Qin Feng locked his brows together. He now understood why the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm expert died from fire poison. Furthermore, the Glorysun Spirit made this dangerous dragon city even more perilous.

At this moment, many cultivators were gathered in the surroundings.

“What are they waiting for?” Liu Yun asked.

Qin Feng pondered briefly before saying, “There’s definitely a weakening period for the Glorysun Spirit, and everyone is waiting for that period. Otherwise, it would be too risky for us to go in now. In fact, we might even be incinerated before we enter the city.”

“It’s that terrifying?” Liu Yun’s face changed when he heard that.

As they waited, more geniuses gathered. Their formations were even stronger than the Thunderflame City’s party as many people had gotten through their tribulation.

Lin Yun was probably the only one in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm, which attracted much attention. Everyone mocked Lin Yun for his foolish courage because none of them felt that he could even enter Flamefeather City.

Lin Yun simply ignored the looks. When he looked around, there were five to six people who gave him the impression that they were strong. They must have used over a million astral pellets in their tribulations.

But what left Lin Yun disappointed was the fact that he didn’t discover anyone in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Reaching the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm wasn’t as easy as he had imagined. The resources required were truly enormous.

“Looks like everyone from Glorysun Land is here,” said Qin Feng while looking around. He seemed to be searching for something and Lin Yun could see the complicated emotions in his pupils.

Lin Yun knew that Qin Feng was looking for geniuses from higher realms, hoping that they wouldn’t show up. Lin Yun shook his head because Qin Feng was terrified by the higher realms. Even if the higher realms didn’t come, he also wouldn’t be able to find anything with his mentality now.

“I don’t see anyone from higher realms,” said Qin Feng in an uncertain tone.

“What is there to be afraid of? According to what I know, their cultivation isn’t that unbelievable. Their cultivation isn’t too high compared to my senior brother and there are even some who haven't reached the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm,” smiled Liu Yun.

Now that he grasped the spiritual sword intent and practiced a greater fortune cultivation technique, he was confident that he could defeat anyone in the same cultivation. He was confident that he wouldn’t be inferior to the geniuses from the higher realms.

Since Mu Yan was able to become famous in Glorysun Land, he believed that he could do the same.

Qin Feng glanced at him lightly and said, “You’ve never gone through that battle, so you have no idea how terrifying they are. Your spiritual sword intent is just a toy in their eyes. Don’t try to provoke them.”

“Interesting. I’m looking forward to meeting them now. It’ll be disappointing if they don’t make it on time to Flamefeather City.” Liu Yun’s eyes surged with fighting spirit as he anticipated the future.

Liu Yun truly had the qualification to be arrogant. After all, it wasn’t easy to comprehend spiritual sword intent. However, his spiritual sword intent hadn’t even reached lesser mastery. So Lin Yun wasn’t optimistic about Liu Yun.

Right at this moment, he raised his head and turned to look in a direction. At the same time, Chen Xuan also spoke out, “They’re here.”

At the same time, everyone turned to look at a black-clothed youth swiftly approaching them. But only Qin Feng wore a bitter expression because he knew that someone from the higher realm ultimately came.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
