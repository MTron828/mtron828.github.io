Chapter 2476 - Fate

Lin Yun returned to the Heavenly Divine Mountain’s summit like it was the back of his home. Raising his head, Lin Yun fell into deep thought, looking at the erected Iris Sword Box. With a wave of his hand, the sword box returned to his back, drawing saint aura from the surroundings into his body.

The Iris Sword Box was an immortal holy land. As long as he carried it on his back, he would cultivate every second without doing anything, constantly increasing his cultivation. To a certain degree, the sword box could be considered his clone who helped him cultivate, and the speed was much faster than Lin Yun cultivated himself.

If the Phoenix Tree took on a humanoid form in the future, Lin Yun could even teach its cultivation technique, allowing it to cultivate in the secret realm and give feedback to him. This was how unique the Iris Secret Box was, but Lin Yun wasn’t concerned about that.

“The sequence of Iris Sword Saint’s secret technique was Flying Sword, Seeking Dao, and Deity Purging, but it seemed different from the tribulation earlier.”

Thinking about it, the power of it earlier was much weaker than his. It wasn’t because the heavenly dao couldn’t achieve it, but it was afraid it might kill him because it was too powerful.

“Heavenly Dao is telling me that my secret technique...can be blocked.” Lin Yun’s facial expression became grave. The Black Emperor might be unable to block it, but that didn’t mean the Empress couldn’t. That was something he had never considered before.

If Lin Yun wanted to make heavenly dao descend the Emperor’s tribulation, he would have to use Heavenly Dragon Possession, summoning the Heavenly Dragon from a million years ago. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Well, I can practice the Heavenly Dragon Bone’s secret technique and comprehend the Myriad Celestial Sword,” Lin Yun made up his mind.

As time passed, the aura released on the Heavenly Divine Mountain’s summit became increasingly terrifying, making everyone in the Skysolute City terrified, as though an immortal was undergoing tribulation.

As time passed, the phenomenon grew even more terrifying that even time-space had become a mess. Under the influence, the grasses in Skysolute City grew rapidly before withering. A blink of an eye would be the entire life cycle of grasses.

“Senior Brother, what is he doing?” Jian Jue stood beside Dao Suspend Sword Saint and frowned, looking at the terrifying phenomenon.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint said, “He’s competing with heavenly dao and merging with it. Master told us long ago that his strength had reached an unimaginable height.”

“Is it that terrifying?” Jian Jue asked. His eyes lit up, and he said, “Since that’s the case, can we mimic him? This way, we will also grow stronger.”

“Don’t even think about it. You have to be qualified to try it. Will you even pay attention to ordinary people outside?” The Dao Suspend Sword Saint said. “You must know that heavenly dao is ruthless, and even if heavenly dao is benevolent, you must be capable of withstanding it. Do you think an ant on the ground can withstand your step?”

“What about him then? Why can he do it?” Jian Jue asked.

“He’s a genius of the Heavenly Path. Those from Heavenly Path are chosen by heavenly dao, to begin with. The Heavenly Path was dangerous, and who knew what hardship they went through,” the Dao Suspend Sword Saint sighed. “Didn’t you see that he killed Tian Xuanzi? Have you faced such a formidable opponent before? You can’t imagine how terrifying it was to face Tian Xuanzi in the Dragon Pulse Realm. Geniuses aren’t grown in the backyard. Once the Heavenly Path is reforged, you conceal your identity and experience some life-and-death experiences. Don’t let your path become too smooth.”

Jian Jue nodded upon hearing that. When he wanted to speak, terrifying lightning echoed on the Heavenly Divine Mountain’s summit, making Jian Jue’s hands tremble. He couldn’t control the trembling of his hands, and he asked, “What is he experiencing over there?”

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint wore a grave expression because he could faintly see a dragon’s head appearing. When he saw the dragon’s gaze, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint felt threatened and quickly kept his gaze.

“My eyes! I’m blind!” But it wasn’t that fortunate for other cultivators. A series of screams could be heard from the surroundings, making Jian Jue’s face pale.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint asked, “So, do you want to mimic him now?”

Jian Jue’s lips were trembling, and he gave up that idea. After all, just glancing at the level of this confrontation would injure him. If he really tried mimicking Liu Wuxie, he would probably be dead.

Comparing with heaven and fusing with dao.

The seven words left behind by Yu Qingfeng were profound, but not even those in the Emperor Realm could attempt them.

Time passed quickly, and it soon came to the 12th of month four.

“Blue Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal, Silver Dragon Seal...Sovereign Dragon Seal!” Lin Yun began forming the Sovereign Dragon Seal on the Heavenly Divine Mountain’s summit. Whenever he formed a dragon seal, he could travel back in time and achieve a resonation with an actual dragon king.

When the Sovereign Dragon Seal was formed, seven-colored radiance bloomed, reaching ten thousand feet away. The clouds in the sky were blown away, enveloping the sky in a seven-colored radiance.

“A success!” Lin Yun smiled in satisfaction. He also knew of the Sovereign Dragon Seal. But the completed version he obtained from the Heavenly Dragon Bone was empowered by the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique, and it could unleash the power of a sovereign.

Three figures descended from the sky: the Radiant Sword Emperor and the two Emperors. The White Emperor smiled, “Young Lord, you’ve made rapid improvements. Your achievement in the dragon clan’s martial techniques even surpassed the emperors of the Divine Dragon Empire.”

Young Lord? Lin Yun soon tossed that to the back of his mind and asked, “Senior, please don’t call me that. It sounds...weird...”

In the past, the White and Black Emperors would address him as lord, which felt weird. But when he heard them calling him young lord, this felt even weirder. After all, these people were mythical figures to him in the past, and his mindset hadn’t changed yet.

“Hahaha! I’m just teasing you,” the White Emperor smiled. “I might be joking, but that’s a decision that I and blacky came up with.”

“Senior?” Lin Yun looked at the Black Emperor. In his impression, the Black Emperor should be a prudent person, but he agreed?

The Black Emperor said, “We didn’t come up with this idea suddenly, but we’ve decided to take you as our lord, giving you our fortune as mythical emperors. In the past three thousand years, the Kunlun Realm knew of the Nine Emperors, allowing us to benefit greatly from the fortune.

“The Empress also benefited greatly from it. She also had the fortune of the empire on her. You don’t know how terrifying her foundation is without fighting her, and it’s unimaginable. These will all manifest in her phenomenon, so we have decided to take you as our lord, causing a greater shock when the swordsmen here pass it out. Can you imagine how shocked everyone would become?”

The Radiant Sword Emperor said, “Would that cause the status of mythical emperors to collapse?”

But the moment the Radiant Sword Emperor finished, he sensed something and seemed to have answered his question.

“That’s what we want. Since we decided to help you, there are no more Nine Emperors, not to mention that the duties of the Nine Emperors were done by suppressing the Dark Era,” the White Emperor smiled.

“The Nine Emperors are one. Now that we take you as our lord, your status will be higher than hers. In addition to the other rumors, this would lead to the collapse of mythical emperors’ status. This way, you can compete with her in fate,” the Black Emperor said.

“So...are we being superstitious?” Lin Yun fell into deep thought.

“Why do you think it doesn’t exist? The fate is on your side,” the Black Emperor said.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun had no choice as he was pushed to this spot. It was like how he challenged all the swordsmen in the world. He said nothing but was pushed to that spot and wasn’t given a choice. Now that he looked at it again, fate also seems to exist.

“Let’s go.”

“Where will the ceremony be held? The Profound Imperial Palace?”

“The Profound Imperial Palace isn’t qualified. The ceremony will only be held in one place, Mount Tai’s Kunlun Dao Stage!”

“Mount Tai? Which Tai?” Lin Yun squinted.

“Tai, as in the beginning of all, the very first mountain. It was a divine mountain located at the center of Kunlun Realm. If you want to reforge the Heavenly Path in the future, you must start from there,” the Black Emperor explained.

Lin Yun was shocked upon hearing that because his story started with Mount Tai from Old Kunlun and ended in Kunlun Realm’s Mount Tai. Everything seemed as though it was fated.

“Let’s go!” The group of four and Lil’ Purple left for Mount Tai.

There was an uproar in the Kunlun Realm because the Empress invited every famous emperor to the Deification Ceremony. Since the Heavenly Path was severed, it had been a hundred thousand years since the Kunlun Realm gave birth to a deity. The only exception was the Blood Moon Sect’s sect master from three thousand years ago.

But it differed from the Empress’ Deification Ceremony because the Blood Moon Sect’s sect master reached the Deity Realm relying on believers.

Everything would change if the Deification Ceremony succeeded and the Empress reached the Deity Realm. But no one knew if the change would be good or bad because many people knew the method she wanted to use to reach the Deity Realm. Aside from that, everyone was curious to see if Flower Burial would show up.
