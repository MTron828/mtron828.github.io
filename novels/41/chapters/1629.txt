Chapter 1630 - Nine-Star Demon Venerable (1)

Two youths were walking together on a barren land. They looked extraordinary and gave off extremely frightening auras. As they looked up ahead, their eyes flickered as they fell into deep thoughts.

“The saint palace should be up ahead.” The golden-robed youth on the right looked graceful with an extraordinary temperament. The one standing beside him also had a pair of sharp gaze and gave off immense pressure. He was Qin Tian, known to be the strongest amongst the Ancient Barren Domain’s Golden Generation.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“We still have to wait for some time. The restriction is still around, but we should be heading in the right direction.” Qin Tian nodded with flames blazing in his pupils. After all, that was the Blue Dragon Saint Palace, a proper inheritance ground. It was the invincible branch of the Dragon Gate in ancient times.

It was rumored that the Nine Emperors received the inheritance from the Dragon Gate’s Ancestral Palaces three millennia ago. This was why they could be invincible in that generation, suppressing the Darkest Era.

The Dragon Gate had long become a forbidden existence within the Divine Dragon Empire. Many people speculated that the current ruler of the Divine Dragon Empire, The Empress, didn’t want anyone to come in contact with the secret of why she could rise. Then again, those were merely rumors, and no one but the Nine Emperors knew about the actual reason.

But three thousand years have passed. Of the Nine Emperors, some died while some left, and the remaining emperors were shrouded in mystery.

“There are records in my Ming Cult that a powerhouse found a priceless treasure in the Blue Dragon Saint Palace during the Darkest Era, the Wind God Order. It’s a Sovereign Saint Artifact comparable to divine artifacts and can sever the starry sky!” The golden-robed youth muttered to himself. He was a disciple of the Ming Cult, from the same sect as Huang Xuanyi, who was previously first on the Elysium Core Ranking.

“Ha.” Qin Tian shook his head with a faint smile. “Those are just rumors. If there was such a treasure, it would have been snatched away long ago. So how can we possibly obtain it? There might not be Sovereign Saint Artifacts, but there must be many saint artifact inheritances. But what is most important is the cultivation techniques. Ghost spirit cultivation techniques will be better if they’re complete.”

Qin Tian’s pupils were blazing with flames, and he was determined to obtain them.

But the golden-robed youth merely smiled and didn’t explain much. He had some disdain in his heart. He didn’t think the Ancient Barren Domain’s sects could enter the Blue Dragon Saint Palace. If the palace wasn’t willing to let anyone enter, even a great saint wouldn’t be able to enter it.

The Ancient Barren Domain’s sects didn’t know about it because they declined too much. This piece of information wasn’t a secret to the various holy lands. But Tian Xuanzi could be considered a figure, and Qin Tian, who Tian Xuanzi personally taught, made him feel a faint pressure.

He felt that Qin Tian had more trump cards, and he couldn’t underestimate this person. He also knew why his master wanted him to cooperate with the Profound Sky Sect.

“Looks like we’re not the only ones here.” Qin Tian swept his gaze around with a playful smile. But those people were cautious and had kept their auras. It would be a little troublesome to feel them all out.

Suddenly, Qin Tian’s face changed, and a chilling aura swept out from him.

This surprised the golden-robed youth, and he asked, “Brother Qin, what’s going on?”

“Dead.” Qin Tian replied.

“Who died?”

“My Junior Brother… Yan Kong!” Qin Tian gritted his teeth.

Those words changed the golden-robed youth’s face, and he asked, “Who in the Ancient Barren Battlefield dares to kill him? Wait… You tasked him with kilingl Lin Yun and told him to bring Lin Yun’s head over to take revenge for my junior brother.”

“The Sword Sect probably killed him.” Qin Tian replied. He was confident that even if the other sects managed to defeat Yan Kong, no one, aside from the Sword Sect, would dare to claim his life. But he was surprised because Yan Kong went with the eight big sects. So, what happened?

“Don’t worry about it, Brother Zhang. I’ll ask around.” Qin Tian was embarrassed because he confidently said Yan Kong would come with Lin Yun’s head.

“Liu Xu didn’t reply to me, so he should be making a breakthrough now.” Qin Tian’s face became dark.

“Don’t worry about it. It’s just Lin Yun, so I can deal with him if your Profound Sky Sect can’t take his life.” Zhang Yuan casually replied.

But Qin Tian’s face was dark. How could he not worry about it? The three of them grasped a unison attack, and they could even kill experts at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm with it. The moment the saint palace appeared, they would be able to kill whoever wasn’t happy with them, and it wouldn’t be a problem for them to gain control of the entire saint palace.

Zhang Yuan suddenly thought of something and looked at Qin Tian with a smile, “I heard that the three of you grasped a unison attack that can suppress everyone. Now that Yan Kong is dead, Brother Qin must be feeling heartache. Can it be that this rumor is true?”

But Qin Tian merely swept a glance at Zhang Yuan and coldly said, “You’re doubting my strength?”

When he was done, Zhao Yuan immediately felt immense pressure, making him feel that Qin Tian was deep and unfathomable. He smiled, “I dare not.”

“The unison attack is real, but even without it, no one can hold a candle to me in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Amongst those of the same generation, I, Qin Tian, am invincible!” Qin Tian’s eyes flashed with fighting spirit.

“What do you plan on doing now?” Zhao Yuan asked.

“I naturally have my own means. The Ancient Barren Battlefield has changed since long ago. It’s just that the Sword Sect isn’t willing to admit it.” Qin Tian said with his eyes squinting.

At the same time, many geniuses of the demonic paths gathered in an eerie valley. If Lin Yun was there, he would definitely be able to notice something because these people were from the various demonic forces he came in contact with at the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. They were the Netherworld Palace, Seven Absolute Palace, Blood Rain Pavilion, Demonfiend Sect, Hundred Ghost Gate, and Heavenly Astral Pavilion.

But they were more low-profiled than they were at the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. After all, the demonic sects and holy lands were of similar status in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and they didn’t dare to publicly display their identity. Thus, they spent a lot of effort to enter the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

Aside from the mysterious Blood Moon Sect, the six demonic sects in the Eastern Desolation were there. The chief disciples of the six demonic sects were gathered together. They were usually arrogant and didn’t put anyone in their eyes, but they kept a low profile now and seemed to be waiting for someone.

A figure appeared on a hill, looking down at everyone. This was a black-robed person donning a mask while standing on the stone pillar like an ice sculpture. The temperament that they gave off was a bit terrifying cold, and anyone could tell that it was a woman as she held onto a fan. Even when she disguised herself as a man, she still couldn’t cover her voluptuous figure.
