Chapter 2051 - Death To Those Who Insult My Master!

Everyone’s hearts shattered when they saw Zhong Yi kneeling on the ground. They couldn’t imagine a sword servant ranked fourth would be so strong.

Zhong Yi was still trying to persevere and stand back up, but all his efforts were futile.

“He’s a direct disciple of a Sword Saint. So how can he be so weak?” Gongsun Yan was surprised.

Ye Ziling was also surprised as she said, “Zhong Yi’s inheritance isn’t weak, not to mention he possesses a saint physique and has grasped the Quasi-Astral Sword Intent. But who the hell is this White Wolf?”

White Wolf couldn't be a nobody with his strength.

“He seems familiar,” Zhao Yan said.

The faces of everyone present were pale, and they were clearly intimidated by White Wolf.

“He should be that heir of the Xiahou Saint Clan, possessing the Natal Sword Physique and Natal Sword Heart. He’s a genius who wanted to become the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. But it was a pity he was rejected because of his vile personality before Flower Burial defeated him and had ten years of his cultivation crippled,” Lin Yun said.

“Xiahou Yan!” The faces of everyone from the Sword Sect changed, and they recalled who this person was. Back during the test, Xiahou Yan shone brightly and nearly humiliated the Sword Sect when he was rejected. In the end, Lin Yun stood out and defeated him. They initially thought he was finished, but they never expected him to show up and become Zhao Wuji’s sword servant.

When Zhong Yi got back up with great difficulty, he was sent flying with a palm on his chest.

“Trash will always be trash,” White Wolf didn’t seem satisfied and pointed his finger at Zhong Yi’s forehead. His finger contained powerful sword intent, making Zhong Yi bleed from his seven orifices and his skull breaking.

Zhong Yi collapsed on the ground and began to twitch. This was a shocking scene that made everyone’s faces pale. A Sword Saint’s direct disciple was completely powerless before White Wolf.

But that wasn’t all. White Wolf stepped on Zhong Yi’s face, shattering his cheek bone. White Wolf laughed cruelly, “Sword Saint’s direct disciple? You’re trash, but I’ll spare you for now.”

“You…” Zhong Yi was still struggling and wanted to say something, but Xiahou Yan gave him a stomp on his head. With that, Zhong Yi fainted, and everyone fell silent because this scene was too brutal. Even if Zhong Yi wasn’t dead, he would probably be crippled.

“Anyone else?!” Xiahou Yan looked around, but no one dared to look at him directly. No one dared to stand out because even Zhong Yi was defeated. Xiahou Yan immediately lost interest and said, “This is boring. Even a Sword Saint’s disciple is so weak, which goes the same for the Radiant Sword Saint. It’s a pity Flower Burial isn’t here, or I’d make him kneel before me!”

“How dare you!” Ye Ziling stood out beside Lin Yun. She couldn’t hold back when Xiahou Yan insulted Flower Burial earlier.

Lin Yun turned to look at Ye Ziling and noticed that her emotions weren’t stable.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Haha! The Eastern Desolation has no one else and needs a woman to stand out?” Xiahou Yan sneered.

“Xiahou Yan, don’t think I can’t recognize you just because you’re wearing a mask. The Sword Sect might be weak, but the Sword Sect isn’t something a sword servant like you can insult,” Ye Ziling said coldly.

Xiahou Yan was briefly stunned that his identity was exposed. He decided that he might as well stop disguising himself and removed his mask. When Xiahou Yan’s face was revealed, all the swordsmen from the Eastern Desolation were shocked.

“He’s Xiahou Yan, the peerless genius from back then!”

“Xiahou Yan, you’re from the Eastern Desolation, so why did you become a dog for the Black Plume Palace!?”

“Xiahou Yan, you traitor! Weren’t you a little too ruthless earlier?!” When everyone from the Eastern Desolation recognized Xiahou Yan, they were furious because Xiahou Yan was a swordsman of the Eastern Desolation. And yet he helped the Northern Ridge humiliate them.

“Ha!” Xiahou Yan sneered. “What’s bad about becoming a dog? I would rather become Young Master Zhao’s dog than become the Sword Sect’s disciple! The Eastern Desolation’s swordsmen are worse than dogs!”

Xiahou Yan swept his gaze around before mockingly looking at Ye Ziling, “You want to stand out for Flower Burial? I advise you to give up because you’re not qualified. I can’t even bother making a move against the Sword Sect. After the Radiant Sword Saint dies, the Sword Sect will be destroyed. So get lost!”

When Xiahou Yan finished speaking, he raised his hand and pushed it towards Ye Ziling. But not only did he fail to push Ye Ziling away, he took several steps back instead. He failed to make contact with Ye Ziling, and his palm collided with a cup. Most importantly, the cup was still spinning in the air.

“Who is it?!” Xiahou Yan was furious and turned to look at where the cup came from. Everyone from the Eastern Desolation also immediately turned their gazes over and they fell onto Ye Qingtian, who summoned the cup and drank the wine in it.

“Who the hell are you to meddle in the Black Plume Palace’s affairs?!” Xiahou Yan roared.

“I’m Flower Burial, burying flowers and people alike,” Lin Yun smiled as he placed the cup down.

“Flower Burial?” Everyone was stunned, and their facial expressions became weird. On the other hand, Xiahou Yan’s face became cold, with murderous intent brimming within his pupils.

“I’m just randomly reciting that phrase. I’m Ye Qingtian of the Heavenly Dao Sect,” Lin Yun smiled. He approached Ye Ziling and said, “Lady Ye, you’re not needed to deal with someone like him.”

Xiahou Yan squinted his eyes and coldly said, “Ye Qingtian? I’ve never heard of you before. I advise you not to meddle in the Black Plume Palace’s affairs!”

“What if I insist on meddling?” Lin Yun asked, looking at Xiahou Yan. His words shocked everyone because they had just witnessed how strong Xiahou Yan was, and Zhong Yi couldn’t even put up any resistance against Xiahou Yan.

No one was optimistic about Ye Qingtian because Ye Qingtian didn’t dare to make a move after facing An Ziyun’s provocation.

“It looks like he’s just like the rumors, showing off in front of beauties.”

“He didn't even have any temper earlier, and yet he dares to stand out now. I bet he doesn’t know how ‘death’ is spelled.” Everyone was happy that someone stood out, but they felt complicated after seeing Ye Qingtian. After all, Ye Qingtian didn’t even have a backbone when he was mocked earlier.

“Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!” Xiahou Yan had stayed in the Northern Ridge for a long time and didn’t know Ye Qingtian’s reputation within the Eastern Desolation. Thus, he didn’t place Ye Qingtian in his eyes. His face became cold, and a powerful sword aura swept out from his body as he simultaneously activated his physique and sword heart.

At the same time, a pair of black wings unfolded behind him that reached a hundred feet in length. As black flames ignited on the wings, everyone present could feel the scorching aura and powerful sword aura. The Demonic Sword Flame was obtained by practicing the Black Plume Sword Canon. When the flames ignited, terrifying runes began to appear behind Xiahou Yan.

Right then, everyone came to their senses and witnessed Xiahou Yan’s true strength. With a sword ray, Xiahou Yan pushed his palm forth with the runes behind him forming into multiple black swords. His palm unleashed a boundless sword aura, and his hand also formed into a sharp blade with black scales appearing.

Lin Yun’s two fingers joined together, circulating the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, and his aura began to change. His aura became as sharp as a saint sword, and everyone’s swords began to tremble as if they wanted to bow to him.

When the palm and fingers clashed, Xiahou Yan’s palm’s toughness was comparable to a saint artifact and was further empowered by demonic flames, reaching a terrifying height. But Xiahou Yan couldn’t get any advantages from Lin Yun as a powerful shockwave rippled out.

Xiahou Yan let out a groan and was sent flying back. He took several steps before stabilizing himself and landing on the ground. His upper clothes exploded with sword wounds left on his body, and he was covered in blood.

Most importantly, the black scales on his right palm fell off with a huge hole in his palm. On the other hand, Lin Yun stood calmly beside Ye Ziling with his hair fluttering in the wind.

This scene immediately left everyone speechless, and many people couldn’t believe this scene.

“How is this possible?”

“Forcing Xiahou Yan to step back with just one move? Doesn’t that mean he’s stronger than Zhong Yi?”

“Isn’t he too humble? He’s so strong, but he doesn’t have a temper, and we all mistook his reputation as fake.” Gongsun Yan’s jaws nearly dropped to the ground, and he didn’t know what to say. When he recalled how he provoked Ye Qingtian earlier, his legs couldn’t stop trembling. This was because if Ye Qingtian made a move back then, he would probably be killed with one finger.

“Who the hell are you?!” Xiahou Yan was shocked. Zhao Hu, Zhao Quan, and Zhao Bao were also shocked. Even Zhao Wuji wouldn’t help turning to look at Ye Qingtian.

“He’s Ye Qingtian, first on the Eastern Desolation’s King Ranking, and a genius swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect!”

“He’s someone who slew a Quasi-Saint before!” The Eastern Desolation’s swordsmen raised their chests in pride after coming to their senses, and they all looked emotional. At this moment, they even forgot about Ye Qingtian peeking at the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden showering.

“The Black Plume Palace doesn’t seem so impressive after all,” Lin Yun said.

“Don’t think I’ll be afraid of you just because you’re someone from the Heavenly Dao Sect. I’m just going easy on you. Even a Sword Saint’s direct disciple is nothing in my eyes, not to mention you!” Xiahou Yan’s face was terrifyingly ugly, and he summoned his saint sword with a wave.

The demonic flames on Xiahou Yan grew even stronger, and the sword aura he gave off made everyone feel suffocating. When Xiahou Yan’s sword aura reached the limit, Xiahou Yan roared and charged over.

“Let me borrow your sword.” Lin Yun drew out the White Dragon Saint Sword when Ye Ziling was in a daze, and the sword released a dragon roar. When Lin Yun drew the sword, a white dragon flew out with its dragon aura enveloping the sky.

No one could see Lin Yun’s actions before Xiahou Yan’s sword was knocked away and the sword aura he gave off plummeting.

When Xiahou Yan raised his head, his eyes were filled with shock.

But Lin Yun didn’t stop there and sheathed the White Dragon Saint Sword before punching Xiahou Yan’s chest. The impact caused cracking sounds from Xiahou Yan’s chest, and Xiahou Yan fell onto his knees with shock in his eyes. Xiahou Yan was having difficulty comprehending how he was defeated so quickly.

“Xiahou Yan, do you enjoy being a dog?”

When Xiahou Yan looked at Ye Qingtian’s eyes, he suddenly found Ye Qingtian’s eyes familiar. He muttered, “You’re…”

“That’s right. It’s me,” Lin Yun replied.

Xiahou Yan squinted his eyes when he heard what Lin Yun said. His soul began to tremble, and he tremblingly said, “T-that’s i-impossible… I-it’s impossible that y-you’re…”

But Lin Yun ignored Xiahou Yan’s stuttering with boundless murderous intent exploding from his pupils.

Zhao Wuji’s face finally changed when he sensed the murderous intent coming from Ye Qingtian and roared, “Stop!”

His roar echoed and spread out, nearly bursting everyone's ear drums, and some were even frightened by the roar to the point of collapsing on the ground.

But Lin Yun ignored Zhao Wuji because those who insulted his master had to die. When Lin Yun’s palm descended, Xiahou Yan’s head burst apart and died.

The surroundings fell into silence, with everyone dumbfounded, but their eyes were filled with fear when they looked at Ye Qingtian. After all, Zhao Wuji had already spoken out, but Ye Qingtian didn’t hesitate to kill Xiahou Yan, which meant Ye Qingtian was in deep trouble now.
