Chapter 2075 - Cocky!

“Why don’t you come and give it a try, then?” Lin Yun coldly looked at Feng Shaoyu under countless disbelieving gazes as he charged at the latter.

“This… What is he trying to do?” This scene dumbfounded everyone. Was Ye Qingtian insane? Did he know how strong a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase was? There were already no odds of him winning this fight, and what Feng Shaoyu said was right. Ye Qingtian could still live if he surrendered, or death would be his only outcome.

“He’s insane!” Ye Ziling couldn’t help feeling nervous for some reason. Everyone else from the Sword Sect also wore grave expressions. As for Zhao Yan, who knew Ye Qingtian’s true identity, his face turned pale as he strongly clenched his right fist.

“Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish, then!” Feng Shaoyu roared with murderous intent gushing out. With a snort, the bizarre crimson eye in the sky released a crimson sword ray, tearing apart the space that was in its path.

But Lin Yun suddenly swung the back of his hand, and the Flower Burial Sword dashed out, cutting the crimson sword ray apart.

Everyone covered their mouths in shock as they exclaimed, their eyes nearly popping out. Their brains even stopped processing for a moment.

Under countless shocked gazes, Lin Yun soared to the sky and didn’t hold back with his Astral Sword Intent. The Flower Burial Sword began to violently tremble with a deafening rumbling coming from the sword, like a war horse galloping across the battlefield. At this moment, there was only the Flower Burial Sword within Lin Yun’s world.

“Fight!” A new sword star appeared above Lin Yun’s head and the broken galaxies converged, forming into thirty-six galaxies.

As Lin Yun walked within the thirty-six galaxies, he held onto the Flower Burial Sword then dashed forth with his long hair fluttering in the wind. At this moment, the two sword stars were shining brightly.

“Dual Sword Stars!”

“Ye Qingtian possesses two sword stars? How is this possible?”

“Holy shit! How the hell is this possible?! How did he manage to possess two sword stars…” The spectators on the observation stand exploded. Even Feng Wuji, the manor master of the Hidden Sword Manor, couldn’t help getting to his feet when he saw this scene.

“Dual Sword Stars!” Feng Wuji opened his mouth as he blankly looked at Ye Qingtian.

Lin Yun was basking in the dazzling starlight like an immortal descending from the sky.

Feng Shaoyu was stunned before he opened his eyes with two seals appearing within the depth of his pupils.

Two purple beams shot out from his eyes. They were his saint aura at the Indigo Origin Phase, containing unbelievable power.

When the purple beams struck the galaxies, the galaxies didn’t collapse as he had predicted. It was like a faint ripple was spreading out across the lake. Feng Shaoyu didn’t expect Ye Qingtian’s talent as a swordsman to be so strong, nor that it could block his saint aura at the Indigo Origin Phase.

A brief moment later, Lin Yun charged over to Feng Shaoyu with his sword, aiming for Feng Shaoyu’s chest.

Feng Shaoyu squinted and calmly raised the Dragon Bone Sword to block the incoming attack.

As sparks flew, Feng Shaoyu took this opportunity to retreat before waving his hand and the crimson eye in the sky immediately fused with the Dragon Bone Sword. When he swung his sword this time, the Dragon Bone Sword reacted as if it came to life and clashed with the incoming Flower Burial Sword.

A loud rumble was produced when the two forces clashed together, and the lake’s surface was torn apart. They were evenly matched in this confrontation.

Looking from afar, Feng Shaoyu looked as though he was enveloped in saint radiance as he wielded the Dragon Bone Sword that released a bright light.

On the other hand, Lin Yun was basked in starlight as the sun and moon blocked Feng Shaoyu’s aura at the Indigo Origin Phase.

As Feng Shaoyu and Lin Yun fought, Lin Yun gradually held the upper hand during the fight after he blocked Feng Shaoyu’s Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase aura. Feng Shaoyu’s face changed, and quickly changed his attack.

“Blood Purgatory Pluto!” Dozens of lightning bolts flew out, gathering into a saint dao in his palm. This was the rumbling thunder dao, a lesser dao of lightning dao. But even so, this was a genuine saint dao. Feng Shaoyu clenched his fist together, and threw his punch at Ye Qingtian’s chest.

Lin Yun immediately felt the terrifying power contained within this fist and circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra at complete mastery and nether energy began to rumble. He clashed with Feng Shaoyu head-on again, their punches colliding before they took a few steps back.

Lin Yun shook his hand, unable to feel it anymore, with blood dripping down.

On the other hand, Feng Shaoyu frowned as he lowered his head to look at the wisps of nether energy constantly trying to corrode his saint aura. Under the nether energy’s corrosion, even his saint dao became incomplete.

“Moon Reflection Mirror!” Lin Yun dashed over, executing the Divine Firefly Sword. Hundreds of mirrors appeared in the surrounding space with a figure reflected in those mirrors. The mirrors overlapped and the surrounding space distorted. Lin Yun’s attack was unleashed, empowered by the two sword stars. This instantly allowed Lin Yun’s attack to erupt with ten times the power.

“Descending Pluto!” Feng Shaoyu swung his sword and faced the Flower Burial Sword head-on.

Even if Lin Yun’s attack was ten times more powerful, his sword barely managed to move his opponent and the Dragon Bone Sword knocked away the Flower Burial Sword.

“Die!” Feng Shaoyu roared. As he shook his wrist, the Dragon Bone Sword formed into hundreds of afterimages as they thrusted towards Lin Yun. But just when he wanted to thrust his sword forth, the Flower Burial Sword flew back due to Lin Yun recalling at an even faster speed, targeting Feng Shaoyu’s back.

“Wanting to fight with your life on the line? Ye Qingtian, you must be dreaming!” Feng Shaoyu mocked as he released his indigo saint aura to protect himself and three saint daos began to manifest into a white saint seal behind him, using the saint seal to block the incoming Flower Burial Sword as Feng Shaoyu carried on with his attack.

The Dragon Bone Sword easily pierced the nirvana aura around Lin Yun before stabbing into the latter’s chest. But just when he wanted to rejoice, a blue radiance shone from Lin Yun’s chest, and the rebound force sent Feng Shaoyu’s sword flying away.

At the same time, a dragon’s roar echoed within Feng Shaoyu’s ears, making his soul tremble. The roar was so loud that it made the scenery before him blur. That was because of the Blue Dragon Bone.

Although Lin Yun was heavily injured by Feng Shaoyu’s sword when it stabbed the Divine Dragon Bone, it wasn’t fatal.

“A Divine Dragon Bone!” Feng Shaoyu was sent flying away, raising his head to excitedly look at Lin Yun. He smiled, “The Heavenly Dao Sect has treated you well to give you a Divine Dragon Bone. Wait for me. After you lose, I’ll dig out your divine dragon bone!”

Lin Yun was speechless when he heard that. Why do so many people want to dig out my divine dragon bone? Is the divine dragon bone something that they can dig out whenever they want?

Feng Shaoyu basked in saint radiance and flew over with his sword, thrusting at Lin Yun’s chest again.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun didn’t block it this time, but circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to the limit. Three thousand Netherflowers appeared beneath his feet, each Netherflower had three hundred petals. Just when they were about to clash together, Lin Yun soared to the sky and didn’t choose to clash with Feng Shaoyu head-on.

“You think you can dodge?” Feng Shaoyu smiled and felt that Ye Qingtian was afraid. But just before he was about to be smug, Lin Yun’s thumb pressed down on his middle finger with a power that had accumulated like a stretched bow.

When a massive Netherflower appeared above him, the flower revolved and looked like a black hole that wanted to devour everything. When Lin Yun flicked his finger, Feng Shaoyu flew away and collided with the kunpeng statue, causing the statue to explode and the entire lake began to rumble.

Everything happened too quickly, and no one could catch that incoming attack. In everyone’s eyes, everyone only saw Ye Qingtian flick his finger, and Feng Shaoyu was sent flying away.

Feng Shaoyu threw out a mouthful of blood and raised his head with a dumbfounded look.

“Not good!” But before he could catch his breath, Feng Shaoyu turned around and ran. The qiongqi statue behind him exploded and sent him flying away while throwing another mouthful of blood.

As Lin Yun continued unleashing his attacks, it didn’t take long for him to destroy the eight statues with the giant sword, the only thing left on the lake.

“Damn it!” Feng Shaoyu furiously roared. “Ye Qingtian, do you dare to fight me head-on?!”

Feng Shaoyu did his best to avoid the incoming attacks, but he was still caught in the aftermath, causing his internal organs to rumble under the shockwaves.

The fusion of energy between Astral Sword Intent and nether energy was like a viper drilling into his internal organs, putting him in great pain. Most importantly, Feng Shaoyu couldn’t erase the nether energy with his saint aura.

“Why don’t you stop dodging, then?” Lin Yun snorted.

Feng Shaoyu’s face sank, and he frowned his brows. His face instantly became quiet because it was like what Ye Qingtian had said. He was the one dodging instead of fighting head-on.

“You must feel terrible, right? The nether energy cannot be erased anytime soon, even if you’ve grasped some insignificant saint daos,” Lin Yun continued.

“So what? How much nirvana aura do you have after executing so many attacks,” Feng Shaoyu retorted.

“I’m afraid that I’ll have to disappoint you.” Lin Yun circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon as the thirty-six galaxies shone even more brightly than before. This made Lin Yun’s hair flutter in the wind and it didn’t look like he was running out of nirvana aura.

“H-How is this possible?” Feng Shaoyu was shocked.

It was true that Lin Yun was running out of nirvana aura. But when he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron together with the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, he could keep producing nirvana aura throughout the fight. This meant that as long as he still had nether energy, his nirvana aura was close to infinite.

“Surrender because I don’t wish to kill you,” Lin Yun said. “If I didn’t have to spare your life, it wouldn't be difficult for me to take your life.”

Everyone was left dumbfounded by this scene, with Feng Wuji’s face sinking because what Lin Yun said was no different from humiliating the Hidden Sword Manor. Gu Zijing, Jiang Yunting, and the others were anxious and didn’t dare to breathe loudly. They were afraid that Feng Wuji would lose his temper.

Gu Zijing and Jiang Yunting helplessly exchanged a gaze because Ye Qingtian was still as cocky as before!
