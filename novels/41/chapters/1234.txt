Chapter 1235 - Finally Knew

The Divine Dragon Sun-Moon Pagoda was the divine artifact of the Divine Dragon Empire. Although the pagoda in the other prefectures were merely replicas, they were still used to suppress the fortune of the Divine Dragon Empire. So the Divine Dragon Pagodas in Kunlun Realm were equivalent to the flags of the Divine Dragon Empire, representing the territories under their control.

From a certain perspective, the Divine Dragon Pagoda represented the Divine Dragon Empire. So what would happen if a Divine Dragon Pagoda fell?

The prefectural lord’s face was ugly as he said, “Come with me. We have no choice but to wake him up by force and make him spit out the divine dragon aura!”

Technically, Lin Yun didn’t break the rules. However, he devoured a little too much of the divine dragon aura. In the past, there were no limits because there was no need to make a limit. Normally, it was impossible for anyone to reach nine wisps or else they would die.

The elders had never seen anyone like Lin Yun who had refined 18 wisps of divine dragon aura when he was only in the Empyrean Realm. It was even more outrageous that he was trying to refine the origin dragon aura. Even if Lin Yun couldn’t spit out the divine dragon aura, the Profound Azure Prefecture could only suck it up. However, they couldn’t let go of the origin dragon aura no matter what.

“Stop!” Just when they were about to head over, a bark resounded and Luo Hua appeared behind them. The elders were briefly stunned and their faces turned black at this woman because this was their Profound Azure Prefecture.

But just when the elders were about to reprimand her, the prefectural lord’s face drastically changed as he hurried over with a smile, “Young Master Luo, why are you here?”

“I’ve always been here,” said Luo Hua. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“It looks like Young Master Luo has a deep relationship with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but this is a special day. If he continues to devour in this manner, the origin dragon aura will be devoured by him and the Divine Dragon Pagoda will collapse.” The prefectural lord didn’t dare to be rude because someone had warned him in advance when Luo Hua entered the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. So he knew that Luo Hua wasn’t someone he could offend.

“It won’t collapse. I’ll take responsibility if it does,” said Luo Hua.

Hearing that, there was nothing the prefectural lord could do but suck it up.

As Lin Yun refined the divine dragon aura in the domain, the purple-golden dragon runes on the surface of his body grew to nearly two hundred. The number of the runes represented the strength of the Azure Dragon Saint Art, similar to the runes on saint artifacts.

In the past, Lin Yun raised the Azure Dragon Saint Art to the fifth stage by refining an astronomical sum of true dragon saint liquid from the old geezer in half a month. So his improvement after half a day was simply unbelievable.

This made Lin Yun excited. If the dragon runes could reach 200, it would be a lot easier for him to defeat Xiahou Jue even if he didn’t draw his sword. He had no idea what would happen if those from the Profound Azure Prefectural knew about that, but he soon tossed it to the back of his mind.

Even if they called him to stop, there was no way he would stop. As the number of dragon runes increased, he continued making swift improvements with the Azure Dragon Saint Art.

Unfortunately, he had given the true bone to Lil’ Purple. Otherwise, he might be able to bring out a portion of the divine rune’s power. But it wasn’t bad either since he had obtained the Blood Flame Dragon Rune.

Although the saint rune couldn’t be compared to the divine rune, he could bring out more of the saint rune's power compared to the divine rune. If he had the divine rune instead of the saint rune, there was no way his current physique would be comparable to a hundred-rune saint artifact.

If he reached the sixth stage, it would be possible to bring his control over the Blood Flame Dragon Rune to a whole new level. As the origin dragon aura continued to flow, the cracks in the domain grew even bigger. At the same time, the number of dragons around him reached 23.

As the dragon aura leaked out, a golden brilliance filled the entire domain. At the same time, Ye Ziling could no longer see Lin Yun, who was devoured by the golden brilliance. “Let’s go. We can’t stay here any longer.”

They couldn’t even see Lin Yun’s outline anymore with the dragons around him, but they could clearly sense the terrifying aura that he was giving off.

“What should we do about Junior Brother Lin?” Feng Zhang asked.

“No need to worry about him. He can bear it with his physique,” replied Ye Ziling. She didn’t seem concerned with Lin Yun’s life and death. After all, it was impossible for Lin Yun not to have that cautiousness since he had gone through so much life and death.

She also wanted to go out to deal with the Profound Azure Prefecture. If she didn’t have a choice, she was prepared to reveal her identity as a descendant of the Radiant Snow Clan. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect couldn’t stop the Profound Azure Prefecture, but there was a high chance for the direct descendant of an ancient saint clan to do so.

Lin Yun had no idea what was going on outside, but he could clearly sense that his physique hadn’t reached the limit. But the refining speed of the divine dragon aura had slowed down and was no longer as ferocious as before.

Lin Yun’s body began to glow with dragon runes flickering on the surface of his body.

“It seems to have slowed down. There isn’t that many divine dragon auras left, but at least the accumulated divine dragon aura within my body should be able to allow me to reach the sixth stage.” Lin Yun murmured.

Three days later, Lin Yun had officially reached the sixth stage in the Azure Dragon Saint Art. The purple-golden dragon runes on the surface of his body has reached a terrifying number of 300. When the purple-golden dragon runes circulated, it was as if a huge dragon had come to life.

When Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes, his eyes shone bright and it took a long time for the golden light to dissipate.

“Azure Dragon Saint Armor!” The Azure Dragon Mark blazed on Lin Yun’s heart as 300 purple-golden dragon runes ignited at the same time. When his body became a purple-golden color, crimson flames suddenly blazed and his vitality violently roared with a terrifying aura spreading out.

When the flames reached their limit, the purple-golden dragon runes on his body began to converge and formed a metallic war armor.

“I can finally summon the armor again.” Lin Yun was filled with emotions looking at the armor. He could still remember how mighty he was when he wore this armor to fight the ten Realm Sons. But after he lost the true bone, he could no longer condense the armor because of the loss of the divine rune.

Now that his Azure Dragon Saint Art has reached the sixth stage, his control over the Blood Flame Dragon Rune increased, and he could finally summon the armor again. With this armor, he might be able to fight one against ten again in the future if the circumstances allowed.

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because this armor didn’t boost his strength, but it did give him more durability.

“This power is really strong!” Lin Yun sensed the surging power within his body and grinned. The benefits he had obtained from the Divine Dragon Baptism had far exceeded his imagination. His harvest was equivalent to half a year of effort in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, not to mention that it wouldn’t leave behind any side effects.

If he fought with Xiahou Jue again, he was confident that he could let Xiahou Jue have ten moves before defeating Xiahou Jue with one punch. Even Lin Yun could feel his scalp going numb just by thinking about the power that would come after igniting all 300 dragon runes.

Furthermore, he could even use the Azure Dragon Grab. At this moment, he could finally bring out the true power of the Azure Dragon Saint Art. A brief moment later, Lin Yun called the dragon runes back into his body. But the surroundings were still lit up with golden brilliance, and the bright light gave Lin Yun some trouble to find his way back.

“You’re finally out,” said the two guards who were responsible for guarding the domain.

Lin Yun wore an awkward expression because he spent a little too long in the domain. But he didn’t know that this was just the beginning. Along the way, he could see the guards of the Profound Azure Prefecture glaring at him.

“So you’re Lin Yun!” Just when he was about to leave the passage, a lesser Elysium Core Realm deacon barked with his brows locked. As he spoke, he reached out with his hand to teach Lin Yun a lesson.

But just when his palm was about to reach Lin Yun, the surface of Lin Yun’s body radiated with golden brilliance and the deacon was sent flying back. Looking at the deacon, Lin Yun smiled, “Sorry, but I’m not familiar with you.”

The deacon who was sent flying glared at Lin Yun before he said coldly, “You can get lost now.”

When Lin Yun left, he was confused because their gazes were weird. When he came out of the passage, he could sense countless gazes. The elders of the Profound Azure Prefecture were gritting their teeth, looking as if they wanted to devour him whole.

This startled Lin Yun because he had no idea what he had done for these people to look at him like he had burnt the graves of their ancestors. But just when he was about to ask, Ye Ziling led the party over and signaled him to keep quiet before leading Lin Yun out with the elders closely following them.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun asked.

“We’ll talk when we’re out,” said Ye Ziling softly. When they came out, the elders stopped and stared at him.

“Just what the hell happened? Why did they look at me like I burnt the graves of their ancestors?” Lin Yun finally couldn’t hold back from asking.

“Do you know how many wisps of divine dragon aura you devoured?” Ye Ziling asked after a long time.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he really didn’t calculate it. He only knew that the divine dragon aura had already dissipated and merged into the golden radiance when he opened his eyes.

Looking at Lin Yun, Ye Ziling said, “72 wisps! You nearly caused the Divine Dragon Pagoda to collapse!”

Hearing that, the corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched with an awkward smile. At this moment, he finally knew what was going on.
