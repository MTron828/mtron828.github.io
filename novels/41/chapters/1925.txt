Lin Yun followed behind Crane Fairy and came to the second trial. Compared to the first trial, Lin Yun easily made it through the second trial and merely used six swords to defeat the gatekeeper. After making it through the second trial, Lin Yun didn’t stop and carried on.

The sword aura emitted from the summit grew even stronger, and Lin Yun felt a heavy weight crushing down with every footstep. The sharp ground soon made Lin Yun’s hands and feet bleed so much that he fell several times and was covered in blood.

When Lin Yun came to the third trial, he discovered that each footstep was tough and felt like a mountain crushing down on him. It felt like another mountain was on his back whenever he stepped out.

Illusions even appeared before him. He took several steps, only to discover in shock that he didn’t move. He had walked out with his heart, but his body wasn’t moving. When he came to his senses, he fell and retreated a few hundred meters away.

It wasn’t easy coming over, and yet he backed off so easily. This naturally made Lin Yun furious with the intention to give up. But he took a deep breath to calm himself down before placing his sword by the side and sat down. He circulated his two saint physiques as golden-purple and blue-jade dragon runes appeared and wandered on his body. It didn’t take long for two dragons to fly out and coil around him.

When Lin Yun reopened his eyes, he discovered that Crane Fairy was still standing before him.

This little girl isn’t a spiritual artifact, so why is she so strong at such a young age? It’s hard for me to move forward, while it’s easy for her, like taking a stroll. Just what is her cultivation? Lin Yun was inwardly alarmed, but he didn’t ask about it.

On the other hand, Crane Fairy was deeply surprised when she looked at Lin Yun.

“It’s no wonder why Master would look at him differently. I’m surprised he can last so long at the Profound Death Stage. Back then, I was already at the Nirvana Stage when I came this far, not to mention I even received guidance from my master…” Crane Fairy tilted her head. Could it be that Ye Qingtian is stronger than him?

“Let me see how far he can reach. Master might not be necessarily right!” Crane Fairy might be smiling on the outside, but she was prideful.

She didn’t convince Lin Yun and the Flower Burial Sword, but she wasn’t convinced by Lin Yun, either. She wasn’t convinced that her master held Lin Yun in such a high opinion.

Over time, Lin Yun would occasionally stop, and the pressure grew stronger as he came closer to the summit.

Whenever Lin Yun took a step, many dragon runes would shatter, and there were even cracking sounds from his bones. He was barely holding up with his two saint physiques. But he still persevered and gritted his teeth, not intending to give up.

Crane Fairy led the way with a smile, but she was surprised whenever she turned around and wondered if Lin Yun was still human.

“My master said that if you can reach the third trial, you’ll only need two swords to resolve the gatekeeper,” the Crane Fairy smiled.

A shocking scene happened because it went according to what Crane Fairy said, and Lin Yun only used two swords to defeat the gatekeeper.

This made Crane Fairy furrow her brows. Lin Yun took so long on the first trial but only used six swords on the second trial. Regarding the third trial, he only used two swords to defeat the gatekeeper.

“I’m increasingly curious about your master now,” Lin Yun smiled and sheathed his sword.

“Ask about it after you reach the summit!” the Crane Fairy smiled.

Lin Yun carried on his journey to the summit. When he was about to reach the summit, he was already bleeding from his eyes, nose, lips, ears, and even brows. His fine features also became sinister, and he was only one step away from ascending the summit.

Standing at the summit, the Crane Fairy smiled, “My master said that if you can take this step out, you’ll be able to see through yourself, and you can defeat the gatekeeper with one sword.”

Lin Yun looked at the summit within his reach and was conflicted in his heart, with his face changing.

“Ye Qingtian, what are you hesitating about?” the Crane Fairy asked.

Lin Yun was deeply conflicted, but he was ultimately relieved. He smiled, “Why am I unhappy when I’ve finally seen the stars?”

When Lin Yun took a step forth, the Divine Tortoise Transformation could no longer hold on, and he returned to his initial appearance. He had an exquisite face, but it was nothing like Ye Qingtian. His facial features were perfect, and the purple mark on his forehead made him look devilish and immortal. The only thing that didn’t change was his pride that was engraved in his bones.

Crane Fairy briefly looked at Lin Yun before she smiled, “So this is what you look like. You look a lot better than your disguise. You look a lot better now, elegant.”

On the other hand, Lin Yun was gasping for air and couldn’t reply.

“I initially thought you were ugly. This is why you hesitated to take that step out. Don’t worry about it. I won’t look down on you, even if you’re ugly,” Crane Fairy smiled.

Lin Yun merely smiled upon hearing that because he had a great exhaustion in his mental energy, but he also understood what Crane Fairy meant.

“You already knew that I’m not Ye Qingtian?”

“Not me. My master is the one who said you’re not Ye Qingtian,” the Crane Fairy said honestly.

“Who’s your master?” Lin Yun’s curiosity for Crane Fairy’s master grew even stronger.

“Since you’ve reached the summit, I’ll reveal a little to you. Everyone only knows that the Heavenly Dao Sect has two sword wielders, but they don’t know that the Heavenly Dao Sect has three swords,” the Crane Fairy smiled.

“The third sword wielder?!” Lin Yun asked, alarmed by what Crane Fairy said.

“Yes and no,” Crane Fairy smiled. “This trial has begun.”

Before the gatekeeper could draw his sword, Lin Yun merely flicked his finger and defeated the gatekeeper. When he flicked his finger, Lin Yun’s sword intent started to rise to the Quasi-Astral Sword Intent. He quickly sat down and was enveloped in sword rays with various phenomena appearing.

When Lin Yun regained consciousness, he discovered he was beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven. A massive cosmic sea was before him, and he felt insignificant, like a speck of dust. He could also see many constellations. He saw the Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, Black Tortoise, and various other Sovereign Constellations.

Some constellations were brightly lit, while some were dim, and you could only see a rough outline. He even saw the Sovereign Constellation that belonged to him, Heavenly Burial. When he turned around, he saw a massive star and moon.

Shortly after, Lin Yun saw many comets flying in his direction. Before he could even consider it, Lin Yun instinctively grabbed the spark of the sun. After grabbing it, Lin Yun opened his eyes and found himself at the summit of the Celestial Purging Mountain, and there was a spark in his sword sea.

“This is the Astral Sword Intent?” Lin Yun retreated with joy, and excitement filling his pupils. He suddenly found it boring because it wasn’t as exciting as expected.

He had waited for this day for a long time, but he found himself terrifyingly calm when he really arrived.

“Here, it’s for you.” Crane Fairy threw out an item, which Lin Yun caught by reflex. When he opened his palm, it was a seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit.

Lin Yun swallowed it without hesitation, and the boundless dragon origin within his violet palace began circulating. The three azure dragon sacred flames also emitted a terrifying dragon roar that echoed within his body. When he absorbed the Heavenly Cloud Fruit, he had recovered from all his injuries and discovered that the merging of the two saint physiques had become closer. This meant that he did not only grasp the Astral Sword Intent but was also one step closer to the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

“Ye Qingtian… wait, is that even your name? Forget it, I’ll call you that for now.” Crane Fairy stood before the cliff and smiled, “Ye Qingtian, I believe you have a lot of doubts. So come with me to see my master.”

“This is only the seventh level, and I’m not in a hurry. I want to carry on,” Lin Yun said. He wanted to reach the ninth level with a significant boost in his strength, obtaining the eight-colored and nine-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits.

But Crane Fairy saw through his thoughts and smiled, “You want to carry on? I bet you’re eyeing the Heavenly Cloud Fruits, right? The Heavenly Cloud Fruits above seven colors are in my hands.”

Lin Yun smiled awkwardly, “Didn’t you say that I can only see your master after reaching the ninth level?”

“You naturally have to climb the ninth level if you want to see my master, but it’s not necessary since my master wants to see you,” smiled the Crane Fairy.

“You have the nine-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits on you?” Lin Yun probed.

“Ye Qingtian, why are you like those lechers eyeing me? Aren’t you curious as to why my master wants to see you?” The Crane Fairy smiled, covering her mouth.

“The saint fruits…”

“Dream on. Even I’m not as greedy as you. You won’t get any if you don’t meet my master. Come with me!” The Crane Fairy knocked on Lin Yun’s head and dragged him into the air.

Lin Yun knew that he could only dream about the eight-colored and nine-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits, and he could obtain more seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits since he ascended the summit. He believed that the Crane Fairy had a lot on her and wondered if she secretly plucked them.

“Found them!” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he saw the location of the seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits after passing through the sea of clouds. They were growing on a cliff and looked like grapes with the Heavenly Cloud Fruits shining brightly like stars.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because he had long discovered the difference between the six-colored and seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits. If six-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits were a thousand years old, the seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits should be at least five thousand years old, and there was a huge difference.

But he could only watch as the Crane Fairy dragged him away. In the end, Lin Yun decided to gamble and sent the Black Tortoise Chains flying, forming into nine thunder serpents. As the chains stretched out, and he was about to reach his limit, the nine thunder serpents seemed to have sensed his determination and bit onto a seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits each.

This made Lin Yun rejoice with his heart beating violently. When the thunder serpents returned, Lin Yun could feel his heart beating wildly with a bright smile looking at the seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits approaching him.

Crane Fairy suddenly noticed that something wasn’t right. When she turned around, she was completely stumped by what she saw.
