Chapter 2328 - Emerald Demonic Ape

Everyone was patiently gathering by the lake, so Lin Jiangxian explained, “The image of the Sovereign Monument will appear each time, but the time varies. Everyone is already used to this, so we must wait here. But it will be dangerous to forcibly head over there.”

“Even for you?” Lin Yun asked.

“There’s no need. The Sovereign Monument is there, and first come, first serve has no meaning,” Lin Jiangxian said.

Lin Yun knew the answer he wanted from that reply. Lin Jiangxian probably could make it through, but there weren’t any benefits.

“Ao Jue is here!” Wu Yuhua whispered with fear in his eyes. Hearing that, even the faces of Chang Jun and Xi Ruo changed. Ao Jue was the chief of the Suspension Palace, and he was known to be the strongest bladesman in the Azure Cloud Realm and an expert from the Brandished Dragon Ranking.

“You met him before?” Lin Yun asked.

Wu Yuhua nodded, “I did. If the chief didn’t arrive in time, the ten-odd of us would have died. He didn’t even draw his weapon to achieve that.”

At that time, if it weren’t because Ao Jue wanted to meet Lin Jiangxian, they would’ve been dead. Even after Lin Jiangxian arrived, he was calm and they exchanged several moves before he left.

Ao Jue had the disciples of the Suspension Palace behind him. When he saw Lin Jiangxian, he smiled, “Lin Jiangxian, you’re just going to wait here?”

“It has nothing to do with you,” Lin Jiangxian said.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ao Jue smiled, looking at the other cultivators around. But those who met gazes with him felt a chill down their spines.

“Mu Xiuhan is here!” It didn’t take long before the Golden Jade Pavilion’s chief disciple, Mu Xiuhan, arrived. He was notorious in the Azure Cloud Realm and was known for his brutality before he became a Saint.

In many people’s hearts, he might be the strongest amongst the four chief disciples in the Azure Cloud Realm.

“The Blood Bone Gate is also here!” The Blood Bone Gate had also arrived, and their chief disciple was Bai Yu. As time passed, more experts arrived and the lake became bustling.

“The image of the Sovereign Monument might be able to stop the Heavenly Sword Pavilion, but can it stop our three demonic sects?” Bai Yu spoke out. His face was terrifyingly cold.

“I have the same thoughts and wanted to make a move a long time ago,” Ao Jue smiled.

“It’s time to go over. It’s pointless to wait here,” Mu Xiuhan said. His words made the faces of many experienced cultivators change and flee.

“You guys think you can escape?” Bai Yu smiled and soared to the sky. A massive crimson bone skeleton appeared that tore apart a constellation and attacked the few Saints who were running away. Their resistance proved futile as they were easily subdued. With a wave of hand, the crimson skeleton held onto five Saints.

Ao Jue and Mu Xiuhan weren’t any weaker and also grabbed several cultivators. This surprised Lin Yun before he figured out what they were trying to do.

“What are they trying to do?” Ji Zixi asked.

“They're using people to open a path for them…” Lin Yun said helplessly.

The three tossed the Saints at the image of the Sovereign Monument. No matter how the Saints tried to struggle, they exploded when they came in contact with the image and their saint origins exploded. This also caused the pressure released by the image of the Saint Sovereign to be weakened.

“Let’s go!” Bai Yu grinned and he charged at the image of the Sovereign Monument with the crimson skeleton above him. At the same time, the cultivators of the Golden Jade Pavilion and Suspension Palace also charged over.

“The image of the Sovereign Monument seems to have been weakened.”

“We can go now!”

“Let’s go!”

“We can’t arrive at the Sovereign Monument slower than the others.” Everyone else came to their senses and charged at the lake. They were calm even after witnessing the death of the cultivators who were thrown over.

“Chief, are we going?” Chang Jun asked.

Lin Jiangxian knew that even if the image of the Sovereign Monument was weakened, many people still died because of it. So, it might not be safe for the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples.

“What do you think?” Lin Jiangxian turned to look at Lin Yun.

“I’m not in a hurry since reaching first has no meaning with the Sovereign Monument,” Lin Yun said.

“Let’s wait, then,” Lin Jiangxian said.

Three days later, the image of the Sovereign Monument had become weak, with the lake becoming calm. There wasn’t anyone else there besides the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples.

“Chief, it’s time for us to head over,” Chang Jun said anxiously.

“I have observed for the past few days, and the lake isn’t safe. Many people have died halfway even if they've managed to withstand the image of the Sovereign Monument,” Wu Yuhua said. The path towards the Sovereign Monument wasn’t safe.

“Let’s go.” Lin Jiangxian said without any hesitation. When they landed on the lake, they could feel a chill rushing at them. They sped up over the lake and discovered that they couldn’t fly under the suppression of the Sovereign Monument. But they didn’t give up and could see corpses along the way.

As the corpses increased, they saw that many were fifth-stage Saint Lords, making everyone feel a chill run down their spines. They finally knew why Lin Jiangxian wasn’t hurrying to head over. She might be fine, but it wasn't the same for everyone else.

Several ghostly figures flew out, charging at them without any signs. Lin Yun was prepared beforehand and waved his hand, sending the incoming ghostly figures flying away. When they took a closer look at those ghostly figures, they saw that they were dried-up corpses without any intelligence.

Lin Jiangxian swung his sword and three corpses were torn into pieces. But before anyone could rejoice, more corpses appeared. Sword rays couldn’t do anything to them, so Lin Jiangxian had to wave her sword again to kill several corpses but couldn’t tear them apart like before.

Those corpses came from everywhere, and some had wings behind them. They were mutated corpses and seemed to be intelligent, based on the light shining in their eyes.

“There are too many of them!” Chang Jun exclaimed with a pale face. The first wave was tough to deal with, and yet there were more.

“That’s Rakshasa.” Lin Jiangxian explained, “They’re from the Nether Realm and should be rare in the Heavenly Barren Realm. There’s something weird about the Sovereign Monument this year. Get into a formation!”

She was calm and let Lin Yun and Ji Zixi stay in the center. When the formation was formed, a towering pavilion descended with everyone’s aura rising. Lin Jiangxian took the lead and executed the Heavenly King Sword. When everyone also performed the Heavenly King Sword, they charged forth, killing everything in their path.

“This is just the beginning, which isn’t a good sign.” Lin Jiangxian caressed her hair and sheathed her sword.

“Well, this isn’t exactly bad news because those who went before us must have suffered a bigger loss,” Lin Yun said.

“I hope so,” Lin Jiangxian said before they continued their journey. They ran into more Rakshasa along the way, but the journey was relatively safe. Half a day later, they finally saw the outline of the Sovereign Monument. It was ancient and gave off a powerful pressure.

Seeing that they were about to reach their objective, everyone had joy on their faces as they sped up. But not long later, a terrifying demonic aura swept out and levelled multiple mountains.

The demonic clouds in the sky were dense as lightning descended, creating cracks in the surrounding space. Lin Jiangxian and Lin Yun’s faces had changed since this was an ominous beast that was even more potent than the python Lin Yun had dealt with previously.

When that demonic beast landed ten meters away, it flattened the ground. This was a golden demonic ape, gasping for breath with blood flowing down from its wounds. It also had a pair of emerald eyes that made it look terrifying.

“That’s an Emerald Demonic Ape.” Lin Yun quickly guessed the origin of this demonic beast. This was more powerful than the python he faced previously, and this ape could quickly kill that python.

“It seems to be injured!” Chang Jun’s eyes lit up with greed. He continued, “Chief, there will be a golden fortune if we kill this Emerald Demonic Ape! We might even be able to obtain imperial fortune if we’re lucky!”

Xi Ruo also looked excited, and said, “The saint origin is also a treasure, not to mention the blood. The entire corpse is a treasure!”

Primordial beasts were rare, and their corpses could be considered a treasure. But Lin Yun merely sneered since anyone could tell that the Emerald Demonic Ape was fleeing.

Chang Jun and Xi Ruo also knew that but couldn’t contain their greed, wanting Lin Jiangxian to make a move. Anyhow, Lin Jiangxian would stand at the front, even if the pursuers of the demonic ape appeared.

Lin Jiangxian ignored Chang Jun and Xi Ruo. Instead, she looked at Lin Yun before turning to Ji Zixi. She asked, “You’ve yet to refine a golden fortune, right?”

She could tell Lin Yun had refined golden fortunes, but not Ji Zixi.

Ji Zixi was briefly stunned, and Lin Jiangxian charged at the Emerald Demonic Ape before she could reply. Everyone from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion excitedly followed behind.

Ji Zixi came to her senses after some time and smiled, “She’s really heroic. I want to marry her.”

Lin Yun rubbed his nose and smiled, “Why didn’t you ask me?”
