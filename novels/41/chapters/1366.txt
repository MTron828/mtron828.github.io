“H-How did he manage to accomplish this?” Lin Yun had widened his mouth with shock filled in his eyes. After all, Zhuge Qingyun was able to fight six Samsara Edict Realm experts, and not a single one of them could inflict any injuries on him.

But Jian Jingtian easily unleashed a sword ray at the summit of the fleeting clouds that pierced through Zhuge Qingyun’s palm from a thousand miles away, and had even left a cut on his cheek.

“Junior Brother!” Feng Jue could feel his blood boiling at this moment as he clenched his right fist. Everyone was shocked by the strength that Jian Jingtian had shown, but Feng Jue never doubted that Jian Jingtian had such strength. Amongst the same generation, Feng Jue firmly believed that Jian Jingtian was the strongest.

“The Sword Sect is really annoying. It has been eighteen years, and your temper hasn’t changed one bit.” Zhuge Qingyun stood on the surface of the ocean as the wound on his palm slowly closed up. When he touched his cheek and saw the blood on his fingers, his already dark expression suddenly smiled.

“I don’t care what you do outside the Fleeting Cloud Island. But if you dare to humiliate my master within the Fleeting Cloud Island, then I’ll kill you!” Jian Jingtian’s cold voice resounded from the summit of the snowy mountain.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see Jian Jingtian standing at the summit with his silver hair emitting a faint glitter.

“Hahaha!” Zhuge Qingyun laughed. “Jian Jingtian, do you still think that it’s the same as eighteen years ago? You’ve been trapped in the Dragon Pulse Realm for the past eighteen years, and I’m no longer the same person that I was before. So you should behave in front of me. Otherwise, I don’t mind leveling the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect to the ground!”

Zhuge Qingyun had rage flashing through his pupils. It had been eighteen years, and Zhuge Qingyun originally thought that Jian Jingtian wouldn’t dare to utter a single word before him if they were to meet again. But it turned out that Jian Jingtian still didn’t place him in his eyes, just like before, and this made him feel that it was unacceptable.

After all, he was suppressed by Jian Jingtian back when he was at the Dragon Pulse Realm, defeated over and over again. Especially their last fight, which was simply the greatest humiliation in his lifetime.

When Feng Jue fled in the direction of the Fleeting Cloud Island with Lin Yun, he had already guessed what Feng Jue was trying to do. The reason why he didn’t end everything sooner was that it was also what he wanted. He wanted to let Jian Jingtian know that he was no longer the same person he once was.

He initially thought that Jian Jingtian wouldn’t dare to utter a single word when facing his provocation and could only watch his master being humiliated. But he never expected that even after eighteen years, Jian Jingtian was still so arrogant, and this made Zhuge Qingyun unhappy because Jian Jingtian should be trembling before him. He couldn’t figure out where Jian Jingtian got his confidence to retaliate.

“Didn’t you hear what I said? Zhuge Qingyun, I asked you to come up and I’ll grant you death,” said Jian Jingtian.

“I’m in no hurry. We’re no longer on the same level now, and I’ve reached a height that you can’t imagine. Jian Jingtian, take a clear look at the difference between us!” Zhuge Qingyun said coldly. When he was done, Zhuge Qingyun stomped his foot on the surface of the ocean, causing the ocean to cave in.

In the next second, Zhuge Qingyun had arrived at the summit of the snowy mountain before he descended with his arms spread apart.

“Go!” Feng Jue couldn’t bother about his injuries right now and immediately flew towards the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect after he struggled back to his feet.

“Let’s head over, too.” As the Golden Crow Wings appeared behind Lin Yun, he grabbed onto Lil’ Purple and followed him, instantly catching up to Feng Jue.

Since Feng Jue was heavily injured, his speed couldn't even be compared to Lin Yun’s. Before Feng Jue could even react, Lin Yun had already grabbed onto him and arrived at the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect with a few leaps.

But just when they wanted to get close to the snowy mountain, they were immediately blocked by an invisible aura. In the end, the three of them could only land on a mountain near the Sword Saint Mountain.

“It has already begun,” said Feng Jue with a grave expression.

Lin Yun knew that Feng Jue was saying that they had clashed with their auras, not physically. But even so, their auras had enveloped the entire region as they began to clash. If one side showed any weakness, then they would instantly face a devastating attack from their opponent.

Right at that moment, the Samsara Edict Realm experts from the other powerful sects entered the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect because they didn’t want to miss this battle. They couldn’t even believe that someone at the Dragon Pulse Realm dared to fight someone who was at the Samsara Edict Realm.

“Old geezer, you have to win!” Lin Yun might seem calm, but he had never been so nervous before. He knew that if Jian Jingtian failed, Jian Jingtian would be facing death or a humiliation that’s even worse than death.

Although he had fought with Jian Jingtian multiple times, he had also considered Jian Jingtian to be his senior. If Jian Jingtian didn’t help him, then he would be dead by now in the Demon Domain. Without Jian Jingtian’s resources, there was no way he could achieve the Seven Flowers Convergence while he was at the Empyrean Realm. Jian Jingtian wasn’t only someone who guided him, but also a friend because their tempers were too alike.

Suddenly, a loud sound echoed from the snowy mountain with a white energy ripple spreading out, followed by a boundless sword aura that exploded from Jian Jingtian, causing Zhuge Qingyun to take several steps back. Evidently, Jian Jingtian had won in the clash of their auras, and this scene nearly made everyone’s jaws fall off. They couldn’t believe that someone at the Dragon Pulse Realm actually won against someone at the Samsara Edict Realm.

“Firmament!” Taking this opportunity, Jian Jingtian used his fingers as a sword and thrust them at Zhuge Qingyun. The sword ray unleashed from his fingers looked like a meteorite that had reached over a hundred meters, suppressing Zhuge Qingyun and not giving him any opportunity.

“How is this possible?!” Zhuge Qingyun was shocked because when Jian Jingtian’s dragon pulses spread out, every single pulse had reached over a hundred feet. Jian Jingtian was at the Dragon Pulse Realm, but his dragon pulses were a little too extravagant and this made no sense at all!

Before he could think more about it, nine lights spread out from Zhuge Qingyun and formed into multiple weapons. There was a sword, blade, spear, fan, halberd, and a few more. They were all thousand-rune saint artifacts. When the nine saint artifacts revolved, they then fused together and formed into a cauldron that was enveloped in nine colors and clashed with Jian Jingtian’s sword.

When both parties clashed, a powerful shockwave rippled, and this scene looked like an apocalypse in the eyes of others.

“Haha! Jian Jingtian, how is my Profound Sky Saint Cauldron? Your dragon pulses might have accumulated to a terrifying height, but there’s nothing you can do before my saint cauldron!” Zhuge Qingyun laughed when he obtained a slight advantage in the battle.

“Then, I’ll just shatter it!” Jian Jingtian soared to the sky with flames blazing on his palm. In the next moment, a dragon flew from his body that emitted a terrifying pressure while being empowered by his sword aura. At the same time, the flame blazing on his palm had become so hot that it was comparable to a dragon’s breath.

Everyone instantly recognized that it was Jian Jingtian’s Innate Divine Dragon Sword Physique, the foundation that allowed Jian Jingtian to reign undefeated in the Ancient Barren Domain back then. When Jian Jingtian raised his palm, the surrounding space began to tremble before his palm landed on the Profound Sky Saint Cauldron.

In the next second, the cauldron cracked before it broke into pieces. When Jian Jingtian soared while dodging the fragments, a sword ray flashed on the surface of his body and a dragon roar echoed from his palm before he easily destroyed Zhuge Qingyun’s aura.

“You’re courting death!” Looking at Jian Jingtian charging over, Zhuge Qingyun let out a roar before he threw his punch out. In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged over a few hundred moves with their auras continuing to clash, it caused a terrifying ripple to start spreading out.

The battle between the two of them was too terrifying and made everyone’s hearts tremble. There were no fancy tricks, the two simply clashed head-on, and this scene left all the Samsara Edict Realm experts dumbfounded with fear flashing through their pupils. Was this the grace of someone who was once known to be first on the three rankings? He’s fighting a Samsara Edict Realm expert when he was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm!

Furthermore, not only was he not defeated by Zhuge Qingyun, but he even managed to suppress his opponent. This had completely overthrown everyone’s common sense. When they saw the nine dragons behind Jian Jingtian, all of this suddenly became comprehensible once more.

After all, other dragon pulses were like a drop of water compared to an ocean. Jian Jingtian might be at the Dragon Pulse Realm, but his dragon pulses were at least a thousand times stronger than other experts at the Dragon Pulse Realm, and this made everyone’s scalps go numb. They knew that if Jian Jingtian made a breakthrough to the Samsara Edict Realm, he would instantly become invincible.

As Jian Jingtian and Zhuge Qingyun separated, their violent auras had reached an unimaginable height. When their auras soared to the sky, it caused a series of shattering sounds from heaven, and this made Zhuge Qingyun’s face ugly. This was because the foundation that Jian Jingtian displayed far exceeded his imagination. Now that he looked at it, Jian Jingtian didn’t stop his footsteps and had been accumulating while remaining at the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“Zhuge Qingyun, I have a sword that will like some guidance from you!” Jian Jingtian’s voice resounded right at that moment. As his hair fluttered in the wind, he roared, “Sword!”

As if the Lightning Shadow Sword had heard what Jian Jingtian said, the Lightning Shadow Sword flew towards Jian Jingtian. When Jian Jingtian held onto the Lightning Shadow Sword, a dazzling golden light shone from him that made him look like a sun deity at this moment.

His already white hair became black and his wrinkles also started disappearing from his face, as if time had rewinded on him. In the next moment, a youth with well-sculpted features appeared before everyone.

Jian Jingtian wasn’t old because he was the Radiant Sword Saint’s youngest disciple, and he was only fifty years old. But because of what he had experienced, his hair had become white in a night, and he had trapped himself in the cage he created. But at this moment, the first on the three rankings, Jian Jingtian was back.

“He’s back!” Feng Jue’s eyes welled up with fear because he knew that the Jian Jingtian he was familiar with had come back today.

When Jian Jingtian held onto the Lightning Shadow Sword and raised it to his head, his eyes raged with flames as the light emitted from the sword made everything seem pale in comparison. When Jian Jingtian was done accumulating his sword aura to the limit, he let out a roar and swung his sword at Zhuge Qingyun, “The Radiant Sword Saint cannot be humiliated!”
