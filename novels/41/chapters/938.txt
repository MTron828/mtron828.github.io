Chapter 939 - Sky Sword Intent

Lin Yun had to admit that the setback he suffered from the mysterious woman was a fortunate opportunity. Without her, it might have taken forever to make a breakthrough in his sword intent.

Lin Yun’s sword intent was heaven-defying and likely wouldn’t be matched by anyone else in the Heavenly Path. Even those outside of the Heavenly Path would have a hard time matching his word intent.

“Well, timing is everything. If I can break through my cage, my sky sword intent will be much stronger than others.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he sat down. Then, he released his spiritual sword intent and azure dragon sword aura without any reservation.

Since he discovered the cage he put himself into, it was only a matter of time before he made a breakthrough. Time gradually passed and the sword intent that surrounded Lin Yun shined like a bright star.

Lin Yun felt strange when he shattered the cage that was restricting his sword intent. Others might not be able to see it clearly, but Lin Yun could clearly sense his sword intent undergoing a transformation.

At this moment, his soul felt like it was spreading out in the sky. As his soul continued to drift, he started to see a gate at the end of the path. If he continued, he would be able to push the gate of the cage open.

While Lin Yun worked on his sword intent, many geniuses were scouring the Heavenly Path for opportunities. Everyone wanted to be prepared for the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. Simultaneously, word got out that Lin Yun killed Kong Xuan.

Lin Yun was a dark horse that came out of nowhere. Although Lin Yun wasn’t on the Azure Dragon Ranking, the name of his sword had already spread throughout the Heavenly Path.

Whenever the higher realms mentioned Lin Yun, they would grit their teeth. Lin Yun killed Kong Xuan and was denying the higher realms self-declared right to all the treasures. His words emboldened everyone to stand up to the higher realms.

The Heavenly Path was meant for all the realms to compete. It was a fact that made everyone’s blood boil now. So everyone was trying their best to find opportunities available. After all, no one wanted to regret their time in the Heavenly Path.

After cultivating for five days, a powerful sword intent surged out of Lin Yun. His sword intent shot into the sky and tore a huge hole through the clouds. When the clouds were torn apart, a majestic gate was revealed.

But just when the terrifying sword intent was about to break open the gate, a wisp of sword ray was released from the gate. It was the second form of the Three Heavenly Divides, but it was a lot more majestic with the Azure Firmament Tree and Iris Flower phenomena hanging high in the sky.

The massive Azure Firmament Tree occupied half of the sky with petals that looked like stars in the night sky. Then, a silver lake spread out with the petals that were shaped like lotuses. At this moment, the sword ray bursting out of the gate had far exceeded Lin Yun’s imagination.

Before the sword ray even descended, Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood from the aura. The cage that Lin Yun had created for himself was too terrifying and it would be terrible if the sword came back down.

He created a sword that could cut down everything beneath the sky. It was a nightmare for his opponents to deal with and Lin Yun never expected that he would have to face it too. Even his majestic sword intent was crumbling.

Lin Yun was feeling immense pain as blood from his seven orifices. Even the two aura oceans in his body showed signs of collapsing. Was this the pain his opponents experienced when facing Azure Lotus?

What goes around comes around. This was something that Lin Yun had to face. If he wasn’t careful, he would be the first genius to die by his own sword in the Heavenly Path. If news of this spread, his legacy would be one of humiliation. However, there was nothing Lin Yun could do under the sword aura.

Am I going to die? Lin Yun’s thoughts flashed quickly as he tried to figure out a solution.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A flaw! An idea suddenly flashed through his mind as he thought of something that could save him. Azure Lotus wasn’t able to kill the mysterious lady because it had a flaw. As long as the flaw existed, Lin Yun had a chance to survive.

Suddenly, Lin Yun opened his eyes as he looked at the attack. The sword slowly expanded in his eyes as it prepared to tear him apart. However, he had finally found the flaw. The lotus phenomenon was full of imperfections.

“Break!” Lin Yun roared as his suppressed sword intent started to gather. It showed signs of going through a rebirth as he prepared to target the flaw.

Suddenly, the lotus exploded and the phenomena in the sky started to fade. Like a current, Lin Yun’s sword aura sped through the remaining sword rays and slammed into the gate.

The gate slammed open and countless beams of light enveloped Lin Yun. Under the radiance, Lin Yun’s hair began to flutter as his eyes shined brightly. The brilliance was so dazzling that Lin Yun looked like a celestial. Noticing the changes, Lin Yun quickly shut his eyes to comprehend the profundity of the light.

The phenomenon lasted for an hour before the hole in the sky slowly closed up. Simultaneously, the brilliance of the light disappeared. After a while, Lin Yun opened his eyes and his pupils shined like stars. The brilliance of Lin Yun’s pupils were enough to make someone feel like they were suffocating.

“Is this sky sword intent?” Lin Yun had joy written on his face as the light in his pupils slowly dissipated. He could sense that it wasn’t the genuine sky sword intent, but it was close. He could vaguely feel that his sword intent didn’t dissipate after breaking through the gate.

“Open!” Lin Yun roared with boundless sword intent blazing in his pupils. Then, a star full of sword intent descended in the form of an azure dragon. When the azure dragon fell onto Lin Yun, his sword intent surged violently. At this moment, Lin Yun felt like he was the sky itself. Clouds descended with the wave of his hand and destroyed the surrounding mountains.

“Is the sky sword intent this powerful?” Lin Yun’s jaw dropped in disbelief because the sky sword intent exceeded his wildest imagination. He could sense that his physique would be ripped into pieces if his sword intent spiraled out of control.

This was the reality of the situation. After all, by some heaven-defying odds, Lin Yun reached lesser mastery with his sky sword intent and his current cultivation couldn’t keep up. Even the empyreans in the Kunlun Realm were unable to grasp the sky sword intent.

Since Lin Yun grasped the sky sword intent in the Heavenly Soul Realm, he passed the bounds of a monstrous genius. His achievements went beyond what generational talents were capable of. As Lin Yun marveled at the power of his sky sword intent, the sound of a breaking chain rang from his body. Did another Primordial Chaos Soul awaken?

At the same time, the ‘broken sword’ within Lin Yun’s body inched its way backwards a little more. Then, a sword ray flashed on Lin Yun’s sword and a bright light lit up the mysterious space within Lin Yun’s body. In that split second, Lin Yun managed to see the outline of the broken sword clearly.

Afterwards, he examined the newly awakened Primordial Chaos Soul.
