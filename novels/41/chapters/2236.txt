Chapter 2237 - Pitiful Tricks

The Asura Dove King’s body was shredded into thousands of pieces aside from his head, which was still intact. The swords looked realistic and covered the Asura Dove King like a hedgehog.

But in reality, those swords were even more terrifying than a saint artifact. These were formed with Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent, Sword Dao, Wind Dao, and Thunder Dao. So it was extremely terrifying and equivalent to having his life controlled by Lin Yun once the sword intent penetrated the body.

The sword intent might not last for eternity, but it wasn’t something that could be removed in a short time. Asura Dove King’s life and death would be in Lin Yun’s hands as long as the sword intent exists.

The Asura Dove King didn’t know Lin Yun’s temper and treated him like a child. But it wasn’t an understatement that Lin Yun climbed through a mountain of corpses and a river of blood to get this far, and god knows how many people he had killed. The massacre Lin Yun had experienced would make Asura Dove King, who only knew how to sacrifice Blood Crows to his sword, feel like a piece of trash. He had no idea how terrifying Lin Yun could be.

“Flower Burial, I’m wrong. I don’t dare to say another word anymore. I will tell you what I know now,” the Asura Dove King begged for mercy, his soul trembling as he looked at the approaching Lin Yun.

With a wave of his hand, all the sword aura turned into invisible sword intent as it wandered within the Asura Dove King’s body.

As blue radiance shone on the surface of Lin Yun’s body, he poured his blue dragon aura into the Asura Dove King’s body through his palm, and the latter’s body was forcibly put together again before it was completely restored without any traces remaining.

As the Asura Dove King stood up again, he tried moving his limbs and discovered that he had recovered. But this time, he didn’t dare to have other thoughts and looked humble. Aside from that, there was despair reflected in his eyes.

He had been intimidated by what Lin Yun had done earlier and didn’t want to experience it again.

“I… Flower Burial, can you let me gather the fragments of my Rahu Sword?” The Asura Dove King asked cautiously.

“You don’t have to be like this. I prefer how you were when you looked arrogant,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

The Asura Dove King didn’t know whether it was sarcasm or if Lin Yun was serious about this, so he smiled awkwardly. When he gathered the fragments and pieced them together, he cut his wrist and soaked them in his blood.

He felt uneasy, while Lin Yun merely looked from the side and didn’t interrupt him. When the Rahu Sword recovered, it began to tremble as though it had come to life and began to devour Asura Dove King’s blood.

Lin Yun was surprised that a broken sword could be pieced together again. Although it wasn’t as powerful as before, it could now be considered a complete sword.

Even if the Rahu Sword hadn’t had enough, the Asura Dove King carefully sheathed the sword and walked over to Lin Yun.

“That sword is extraordinary,” Lin Yun said.

The Asura Dove King’s heart clenched, and said, “It’s nothing. This is just an ordinary sword; I had been reckless earlier.”

Lin Yun glanced at him, and said, “I already said that I prefer your arrogant look earlier.”

“I… I’ll do my best,” the Asura Dove King said as he trembled.

Lin Yun no longer asked him about the Rahu Sword. That sword was extraordinary in that it had given birth to a sword spirit, which was why it could be restored even after being reduced to fragments. Lin Yun felt that this sword had a terrifying origin. After all, no ordinary sword could last so long after being held by him.

“Speak, where’s Su Ziyao?” Lin Yun asked.

The Asura Dove King wore an unsightly expression, but said, “Actually, I don’t know where she is because the Demonspirit Clan and Blood Moon Sect are after her. She’s terrifying because she killed so many Saints even when they ganged up on her, and I have never seen such a terrifying woman before.”

“So… you were lying to me?” Lin Yun asked.

The Asura Dove King’s face became pale, and he said, “I don’t know much information, but I can guarantee that she’s alive. The Ying River King once casually said that the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan couldn’t find her.”

Those words made Lin Yun sigh in relief, and he asked, “Do you know what she took?”

“I heard something about a divine rune, but I don’t know the exact information,” the Asura Dove King said as he looked at Lin Yun’s face.

“The Lunar Divine Rune!” Lil’ Purple said.

“Yeah! That’s it! The Lunar Divine Rune! I remember them saying that the Lunar Divine Rune has been snatched, and they’re trying to use divine flame as a replacement,” the Asura Dove King said quickly.

“Lin Yun!” Lil’ Purple turned to look at Lin Yun emotionally.

Lin Yun became silent because Su Ziyao was in a very dangerous position now that the Lunar Divine Rune was in her hands. The Demonspirit Clan and Blood Moon Sect definitely wouldn’t let her off, especially since they were in the Heavenly Void. If they were in the outside world, it would be much harder for the Demonspirit Clan and Blood Moon Sect to kill her.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Big Brother, someone’s here… It’s the Demonspirit Clan,” Lil’ Red said after sniffing the air.

Lin Yun raised his head, and said, “You guys enter the Iris Secret Realm here. There’s more than one of them.”

“What about him?” Lil’ Purple pointed at the trembling Asura Dove King.

“Bring him in as well, and give him a droplet of Mandala Fragrance if you still have any,” Lin Yun said calmly.

When the Asura Dove King heard that Lin Yun would give him a droplet of Mandala Fragrance, his eyelid twitched, but he quickly concealed his emotions.

Right then, a black gale swept over, followed by a muffled voice.

“Flower Burial truly deserves your reputation as the Radiant Sword Saint’s direct disciple. I’m afraid no one can kill a Saint Lord like you while being at the Quasi-Saint Realm.” As a gale blew over, a figure appeared before Lin Yun. This person was called Kui’erkong and there was another Demonspirit beside him, Kui’ertuo.

In addition to Kui’erdo, whom Lin Yun killed, the three Demonspirits were the ones who were in charge of ripening the Othershore Flower earlier before Lin Yun seized it. The bodies of the two looked withered, but they had vicious gazes.

Compared to their previous condition, they were both at their prime and were even stronger than before. If Kui’erdo was at his prime, he would be comparable to five Horizon Hawk Saint Lords. With the two Demonspirits together, their strength was at least comparable to twelve Horizon Hawk Saint Lords.

“Saint Lord? What Saint Lord?” Lin Yun feigned ignorance.

Kui’erkong and Kui’ertuo exchanged a gaze with their faces becoming uncertain. Could it be that Lin Yun didn’t kill Kui’erdo?

“I don’t know you guys, and we all have different objectives in the Heavenly Void. So there’s no need to make a move. We can go our separate ways,” Lin Yun said calmly.

Kui’erkong stopped Lin Yun, and he smiled, “Don’t be in a hurry to leave. We would like to chat more about that injured Asura Dove King, the grievance between your master and the Divine Dragon Empire, and the chaos in the Eastern Desolation. We might have different objectives, but there is room for us to cooperate as long as we share the same interest. The other holy lands have entered the Eastern Desolation, and the scale is pretty frightening. According to what I know, the lords of those holy lands have a good relationship with Tian Xuanzi, and I’m afraid that they will want to kill you more than us if they see you.”

What this Demonspirit said wasn’t wrong because if the Ming Cult discovered him, his condition would probably become terrible. After all, the Heavenly Void was the best place to kill someone.

“That has nothing to do with you guys,” Lin Yun said indifferently. He was curious and guessed that these two wanted to buy time. But the Demonspirit’s probing of him all came with intentions of pulling him to their side, believing that he would have a fall out with the Divine Dragon Empire.

Then again, Lin Yun wouldn’t cooperate with the Demonspirit even if he did fall out with the Divine Dragon Empire.

Kui’erkong smiled, “In the Kunlun Realm, you guys like to call us Demonspirits, but we’re the noble Spirit Clan. Since ancient times, many cultivators have cooperated with us. You have peerless talent, and we can give you what the Kunlun Realm can’t, allowing you to grow rapidly. Otherwise, your talent will be a huge waste.”

Lin Yun inwardly sneered and didn’t expose that Kui’erkong wanted to buy time. He was also buying time since he had exhausted his blue dragon aura in his fight with the Asura Dove King, and he still wasn’t at his prime.

“I have visited those ancient ruins before and know what you guys did. So let’s cut the crap and go our separate ways,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

Kui’erkong’s face became cold, and he said, “Don’t push it. You killed Kui’erdo, so you better come with us obediently. Otherwise, don’t blame us for making it ugly for you.”

The two Demonspirits no longer continued with their act after seeing that Lin Yun had no intentions of changing his mind, and they began to release their murderous intent with their saint auras spreading out.

But Lin Yun looked calm because he also didn’t want to let these two go when these two didn’t want to let him go. He casually glanced at the demonic corpses that were waiting in ambush, and saw about seventy to eighty of them.

“He cannot be underestimated since he can kill Kui’erdo, even if Kui’erdo wasn’t at his prime. So don’t be careless.” Kui’erkong said calmly as he took out a bizarre secret treasure. This flag, an ancient Glory Saint Artifact with nine Divine Runes engraved on it, could keep a hundred saint souls.

When Kui’erkong activated the flag to the limit, crimson saint souls flew out from the flag; those saint souls let out a sharp scream. The entire sky was dyed red, and Lin Yun felt that his soul was about to be ripped apart under the pressure.

Lin Yun gauged their strength, and realized that they were at the pinnacle of the second-stage Saint Lord. Although he killed Kui’erdo and subdued the Asura Dove King, those were under the condition that they were extremely weakened. He had never fought a Saint Lord in the Heavenly Void who was at their prime.

“Hundred Ghost Parade!” Kui’erkong waved his hand and hundreds of crimson souls flew out like crimson flames, descending from the sky. He also threw the flag and the Spiritual Ghost Flag descended like a crushing mountain.

This enveloped Lin Yun's space in red, and the surrounding space became stagnant. But Lin Yun didn’t panic. A golden light suddenly shone in his eyes, and he muttered, “Divine light…”

The crimson space shattered as he released his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent. The Flower Burial Sword flew out with another roar as he dashed forth.

The golden radiance in the sky flashed in the crimson space, slaying the crimson saint souls. At the same time, Lin Yun activated the glory spirits in the Flower Burial Sword and thrusted at the Spiritual Ghost Flag.

As an explosion took place, the Spiritual Ghost Flag smashed against the ground, causing a cloud of dust to rise up. The flag shattered the sword ray and suppressed his sword intent before controlling the saint souls to dash over with a powerful saint aura that caused the surrounding space to reverberate.

A giant crater was created on the ground from the huge amount of force as the Spiritual Ghost Flag brought Lin Yun and the Flower Burial Sword down to the ground, forcing them a few hundred meters into the ground.

Kui’ertuo said, “To be defeated by the Spiritual Ghost Flag, it looks like there’s nothing special about Flower Burial after all. All your cautiousness was for nothing, and I even summoned all the demonic corpses over.”

Kui’erkong waved his hand to summon the Spiritual Ghost Flag and smiled, “Do you know the meaning of the higher you are, the harder you fall? Heavenly Dragon Lord Flower Burial is nothing compared to my Spirit Clan. He didn’t even know who he was just because we were being a little polite to him. Cultivators in the Kunlun Realm are our slaves and should live as livestock as our food.”

Kui’ertuo looked at the ground and said, “Let’s hope he’s not dead. The Ying River King is interested in him, and we might be able to find that woman if we capture him…”

“That might be impossible.” Kui’erkong’s face became ugly, and said, “That was the full attack of the Spiritual Ghost Flag. Let’s not mention a Quasi-Saint, even a third-stage Saint Lord would be heavily injured by that attack. I’m afraid he didn’t even leave his corpse behind…”

But just when he was about to finish speaking, fine cracks appeared on the Spiritual Ghost Flag that swiftly spread out. This treasure was showing signs of breaking apart. This instantly made Kui’erkong’s face change, and he exclaimed, “How is this possible? My Spiritual Ghost Flag…”

Kui’ertuo, by the side, was also dumbfounded with surprise.

“You dare use such pitiful tricks to fight me?” Just when Kui’erkong and Kui’ertuo were feeling uneasy, a roar came from the crater as a sword ray soared to the sky, lighting up the sky and tearing the clouds apart.

Shortly after, Kui’erkong and Kui’ertuo looked with disbelief as Lin Yun rose to the sky like a deity in his azure robe, enveloped in a dazzling radiance.
