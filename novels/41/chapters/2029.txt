Chapter 2030 - Settling Old and New Scores!

Lin Yun soared to the sky after he was done speaking. Wang Muyan was fast, and he could only see her blurred figure in the darkness.

Her speed wasn’t compatible with her cultivation at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and Lin Yun had to use his full strength to keep up with her. If Wang Muyan was a little faster, Lin Yun would have to bring out the Golden Crow Wings if he wanted to catch up with her.

“She didn’t leave the city.” Lin Yun was baffled because he thought Wang Muyan wanted to flee the city, and an ambush might be waiting for him outside the city. But Wang Muyan was heading to the center of the city instead.

Fifteen minutes later, Wang Muyan landed on a stone pillar. This was the altar within Six Holy City, with a stone monument erected on the plaza. The stone monument was filled with obscure scriptures.

The plaza was massive but desolated with a thick layer of dust that had been there for a long time, and the scriptures on the stone monument were no longer readable.

Lin Yun landed not far from the stone monument, looking at Wang Muyan with doubts within his pupils. Wang Muyan stared at the stone monument and said, “Ye Qingtian, do you know what this monument is?”

Hearing what Wang Muyan said, Lin Yun turned to look at the erected monument. There was a legend that this was a Deity-Sealing Monument with an actual deity sealed within it. That was the information Lin Yun read from some books before coming to the God Burial Mountain Range.

He knew that Six Holy City was an ancient Dragon City. It was destroyed in ancient times and was repaired before being occupied by the six holy lands.

Wang Muyan didn’t wait for Lin Yun’s response and muttered, “This is a Deity-Sealing Monument. But the scriptures disappeared when the city was destroyed during ancient times, and deities no longer existed. The Southern Emperor personally fixed this monument three thousand years ago and wrote the scriptures. The entire seal around the God Burial Mountain Range comes from this stone monument, and no Saints can enter even after three thousand years.”

Lin Yun had no changes on his face and said, “There’s no point telling me about this.”

He already decided to kill Wang Muyan and wouldn’t let her go because of some secrets.

Wang Muyan turned around and smiled, “Of course. I wouldn’t let go of such a good opportunity if I was in your position.”

She circled the monument before sitting on the stone pillar. Her facial features were outlined under the moonlight as she continued, “But you can’t kill me because the Astral Sword Intent isn’t invincible.”

“You seem very confident in yourself,” Lin Yun said.

Wang Muyan smiled, “There aren’t only friends and enemies in the world. The reason why we have come this far is because we have no trust between us. If you’re willing to tell me why you’re searching for the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, I can tell you why I’m looking for it.”

“Perhaps we can use another method.” Lin Yun held onto the sword and wasted no words with Wang Muyan. Filling his body with nirvana aura, Lin Yun’s Astral Sword Intent exploded as he coldly looked at Wang Muyan.

Wang Muyan maintained her smile as a mysterious crimson moon appeared within her pupils. As an ancient aura rampaged within her body, she instantly became deep and unfathomable.

“It looks like your secrets aren’t as simple as the Blood Moon Sect,” Lin Yun said.

“You can give it a try. I have more secrets than you think,” Wang Muyan smiled. No one could see anything on her face.

Lin Yun drew his sword and his sword intent swept out. He didn’t hold back in releasing his Astral Sword Intent. When he released his sword intent, a starry sky appeared behind him with stars being faintly visible, and his sword rays enveloped Wang Muyan.

Wang Muyan calmly swung two red cloths that clashed with the incoming sword rays.

But Lin Yun left behind an afterimage, and his sword ray enveloped Wang Muyan. But Wang Muyan didn’t move. The red cloth was like an impenetrable fortress that was protecting her.

“H-How is this possible?” Lin Yun was surprised because Wang Muyan actually managed to resist his Astral Sword Intent, which was too unbelievable, not to mention Wang Muyan was only at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

“Ye Qingtian, is this all you have?” Wang Muyan smiled.

Seeing this, the star within Lin Yun’s sword sea began to blaze with his Astral Sword Intent fully unleashed. The red cloths were knocked away as Lin Yun dashed forth with the Flower Burial Sword targeting Wang Muyan’s forehead.

There were no changes to Wang Muyan’s smile as she disappeared, leaving ripples in the surrounding space whenever she moved. She was using a bizarre movement technique, and Lin Yun couldn’t lock onto her due to her movement technique.

The surroundings were filled with Wang Muyan’s figures as a powerful charm was released from her. Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Heart throbbed as he restored his clarity and stabbed forth with the Flower Burial Sword, breaking through the fluctuation in the surrounding space.

As cracking sounds echoed, space was like glass that shattered apart, and the chaotic space was returned to the right track.

This surprised Wang Muyan because she couldn’t avoid it in time. Her hand became jade-white, before she clamped onto the Flower Burial Sword. An ancient seal was blooming at the back of her hand, and her hand was emitting a jade-white radiance.

Lin Yun stretched his hand forth and was shocked to discover that his sword couldn’t move. It was as though a strange power was restraining it. But what surprised Lin Yun even more was that Wang Muyan could see his sword's trajectory, which was unbelievable.

Wang Muyan smiled, “This is a secret technique of the Dragon Gate, the Spirit Jade Finger. It’s an ancient technique, and no sword techniques can break through it.”

Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered to argue with Wang Muyan and released his sword before appearing behind her. As his hands joined together, a powerful dragon aura swept out from him as he formed the Sovereign Dragon Seal.

In the blink of an eye, seven colors shone from his palm as he executed the complete Sovereign Dragon Seal.

This shocked Wang Muyan, forcing her to let go of the Flower Burial Sword and turned around. The red cloths had quickly gathered together. When the Sovereign Dragon Seal clashed with the red cloths, they produced a huge commotion before the red cloths collapsed with Wang Muyan flying away.

“Light of the Beginning!” Lin Yun grabbed the Flower Burial Sword and swung it.

“Almighty Heavens!” Wang Muyan had fear reflected in her pupils with her hands clasped together. She seemed to have become a deity at this moment and was more prestigious than heaven.

The collision of their attacks caused a huge flash of light before Lin Yun and Wang Muyan were sent flying away, landing on a stone pillar each.

Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword and said, “With this move alone, you’re stronger than Jin Xuanyi. The rumors are true; you possess the Sun-Moon Divine Physique.”

Wang Muyan formed a seal, before she was surrounded by light. An ancient crimson moon seal bloomed within her pupils that cleansed the charm she was giving off, adding a layer of divinity to her.

Shaking her head, Wang Muyan said, “I still can’t fully use the power of the Sun-Moon Divine Physique. You just refuse to admit that the Astral Sword Intent isn’t invincible.”

Lin Yun’s face changed. He didn’t admire Wang Muyan. He didn’t like those scheming behind his back, but he would show his respect for his enemy as long as they showed enough strength. Wang Muyan was the former because she had always been scheming.

“With your strength, you didn’t have to rely on Xiao Jingyan and Jin Xuanyi. If you had come to the Myriad Graves Valley, it’s uncertain who would have died,” Lin Yun said. This was the doubt he had. Since Xin Yan could think about it, Lin Yun could also naturally think about it.

“We spent such good times together in the past, so how could I bear killing you? I just want you to return to my side,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“I’m not Ye Qingtian,” Lin Yun said.

“It doesn’t matter who you are because you have caught my attention. If you’re willing to return, I will treat you well,” Wang Muyan smiled.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“As a chess piece? Someone like you has no heart at all,” Lin Yun sneered.

Wang Muyan wasn’t furious when she heard that. She smiled, “Are you jealous? You’re different from Xiao Jingyan and Jin Xuanyi. They’re only flies, but you have my love. I told you that the Astral Sword Intent isn’t invincible. Ever since the Sword Sect declined, the overall strength of swordsmen within the Eastern Desolation has plummeted. The current sacred ground for swordsmen is Skysolute City, the Hidden Sword Manor, and the Divine Dragon Sword Pavilion, the rising stars of the Sword League.”

Lin Yun raised his head and asked, “What are you trying to say?”

“I want to say that I can give you anything, more than what the Heavenly Dao Sect can give you,” Wang Muyan said.

“You’re not able to last long, right?” Lin Yun asked.

Wang Muyan’s face changed when she heard that. Before she could reply, Lin Yun suddenly moved and the Flower Burial Sword flew out with a flick.

The two glory spirits within the Flower Burial Sword were activated and the red cloth was knocked back. Lin Yun shook his arms while activating the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, releasing a silver sword radiance that looked like a domain, isolating Wang Muyan from the outside world.

As the crimson moon within Wang Muyan’s pupils disappeared, the aura she gave off immediately plummeted, and she threw out a mouthful of blood, her face becoming pale. She immediately felt suffocating when the Astral Sword Intent came crashing down on her.

“I’ve been wondering why you brought me here, and I finally understand now. You can’t use the power of the Sun-Moon Divine Physique, so you wanted to use the power beneath the Deity-Sealing Monument!” Lin Yun said, looking at Wang Muyan.

It was as he had expected. When the Azure Dragon Sword Heart isolated her from the outside world, Wang Muyan’s power immediately disappeared, and she couldn’t even stand up against him with her cultivation at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

Wang Muyan’s face changed, and was no longer as calm as before. While coldly looking at Lin Yun, she said, “It looks like I have underestimated you!”

“You don’t have to look at me that way. The game has just begun. I told you not to fall into my hands, since I have plenty of ways to deal with you!” Lin Yun recalled how he was tricked by Wang Muyan when he just came to the Heavenly Dao Sect. When he went to the Myriad Graves Valley, he faced a tough opponent like Xiao Jingyan. So it was time for him to settle the old and new scores with her.

When Lin Yun grabbed her shoulder, Wang Muyan immediately felt something wasn’t right. She asked in a trembling tone, “W-What are you trying to do?”

Lin Yun tucked and ripped Wang Muyan’s clothes, leaving behind a thin cloth that enveloped her voluptuous figure.

This made Wang Muyan briefly stunned before she smiled, “Ye Qingtian, is this what you want? You could’ve just told me about it. There’s no need for such trouble. I can give it to you anytime you want.”

But Lin Yun merely smiled and stepped forth, grabbing Wang Muyan’s wrist.

Wang Muyan’s hands covered her chest, but Lin Yun realized she was struggling. This immediately confirmed Lin Yun’s speculation that Wang Muyan was putting on an act.

Wang Muyan’s face became pale as she tremblingly said, “Ye Qingtian, are you serious?!”

“Weren’t you cocky earlier? Didn’t you say that I can do anything I want as long as I can catch up to you? Why are you unwilling now?” Lin Yun smiled.

Wang Muyan was furious, and she struggled, “Let me go! You’re committing baptism against a deity!”

Lin Yun was surprised when he heard that. This confirmed that Wang Muyan was the Blood Moon Sect’s Divine Maiden.

“Scream all you want because no one can hear you.” Lin Yun slowly separated Wang Muyan’s arm from her chest with brute force. This place was deserted for a long time, not to mention Wang Muyan was within his domain. So her voice couldn’t spread out no matter how she screamed.

As Lin Yun slowly separated Wang Muyan’s arm, more of Wang Muyan’s body was revealed, and this made Wang Muyan’s face paler. She was really frightened this time.
