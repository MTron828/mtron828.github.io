Chapter 2279 - The Meaning Of A Sword God

“Flower Burial, your opponent is me!” The Ying River King, in his white robe, landed on the Flame Dragon’s skull. He purposely used his saint energy when he landed on the Flame Dragon’s skull, wanting to push the skull down.

But the Ying River King’s feet only created a creaking sound and couldn’t suppress the Flame Dragon’s skull.

“What a pity.” Lin Yun recollected his gaze from Wang Muyan with a smear of disappointment in his eyes. That was a great opportunity since Ji Zixi had severed the connection between Wang Muyan and the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. If he took this opportunity, he could have retrieved the divine flame fragment.

But it was a pity that he missed the opportunity. Wang Muyan was enveloped in the radiance of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda once more.

The Ying River King’s eyes were filled with murderous intent as he sneered, “Ha, it looks like you didn’t treat me seriously.”

“You’re merely someone who lost to me. So why should I be bothered with you?” Lin Yun replied indifferently.

“You know my strength well, so there’s no need to provoke me,” the Ying River King smiled.

As Lin Yun raised his head, he said, “I have no intentions of provoking you. In my opinion, you’re still somewhat lacking.”

While Lin Yun and the Ying River King talked, all the cultivators within Flame Dragon Valley subconsciously gathered around the Flame Dragon’s skeleton as they fought the demonic corpses. After all, it was tough for them to break free from the encirclement under this situation. They were already in despair but couldn’t help feeling a little hopeful after seeing Lin Yun inflict heavy injuries on Wang Muyan. They had placed their hopes on Lin Yun now.

The Ying River King coldly looked at Lin Yun, “You have just fought with the divine maiden. I won’t take advantage of you because I will let you know that even without activating my bloodline, I can still defeat you.”

The Ying River King still held his previous loss with Lin Yun in his heart. He was a genius of the Demonspirit Clan with a noble bloodline and rarely had any opponents who were of the same cultivation, not to mention the same generation. So how could he accept being defeated by a swordsman in his twenties? He shouldn't have lost even if he didn’t activate his bloodline, so he blamed it on being careless. He was confident that he could easily defeat Lin Yun if he became serious.

When he was done speaking, a flower appeared behind the Ying River King. It was one of the thirty-six Sovereign Daos, the Great Yin Dao.

“You dare to be distracted in a fight between us? You’re arrogant!” The Ying River King arrived, and instantly restrained Lin Yun’s sword aura and dragon aura. His domain was like an invisible hand choking the dragon's aura and shattering the sword aura. His white hair fluttered in the wind, looking like an immortal, giving off a frightening aura.

Lin Yun’s interest was piqued. But he glanced to the side and saw Zhao Tianyu suppressing Ji Zixi with his Divine Lightning Eyes. Ji Zixi had exhausted a lot of her saint energy earlier, and she couldn’t control the Divine Phoenix Mirror anytime soon. So, the situation wasn’t favorable to her.

Seeing this, Lin Yun no longer wanted to waste time with the Ying River King. The three hundred ribbons around him instantly grew to three thousand. As tens of thousands of light beams exploded from Lin Yun, his hands clasped together and a dao flower appeared behind him. It was also one of the thirty-six Sovereign Daos, the Sword Dao.

Sword Dao was like a ribbon that had manifested into three thousand silver ribbons and blew up the Ying River King’s Great Yin Domain, causing the latter’s face to change as he looked at Lin Yun with shock.

“Do you think that you’re the only one who has grasped a Sovereign Dao?” Lin Yun asked in a mocking tone.

This immediately made the Ying River King want to retreat, but he quickly stopped and wanted to step back.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“You think you can leave?” Before the Ying River King could step back, Lin Yun dashed over and arrived before the former.

The Ying River King threw out ten-odd palms, but all his attacks only managed to attack Lin Yun’s afterimages.

With a roar, Lin Yun’s afterimages overlapped and he used his fingers as a sword, unleashing a dazzling radiance. This made the Ying River King throw out blood with a hole in his chest while he was sent flying away.

But Lin Yun didn’t care about him and came to the front of the Flame Dragon’s skull, looking down. He saw Zhao Tianyu sending Ji Zixi flying away with the Divine Lightning Eyes before charging at her again. This was a great opportunity, and Zhao Tianyu didn’t want to give up. He could snatch the Divine Phoenix Mirror and inflict heavy injuries on Ji Zixi if he grasped this opportunity.

“Protect the holy maiden!” The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Saint Elders became anxious.

“Haha! Come!” Zhao Tianyu laughed as lightning gushed from his eyes, easily sending all the saint elders before him flying away after only a few exchanges. When he saw more saint elders charging over, he laughed and stretched his right hand out.

“Moon Picking Hand!” As he rubbed his fingers together, a bright moon rose to the sky as a moon appeared on the back of his hand. Ten-odd saint elders were sent flying away as he shuttled through the crowd and landed towards Ji Zixi. Everything happened in the blink of an eye, and no one could react in time.

But just when Zhao Tianyu was about to descend, a sword ray pierced through the air and arrived behind him.

“Mhm?” Zhao Tianyu was shocked while sensing a highly dangerous aura. Before he could think about it, he turned around and left behind several afterimages in the air. But when he landed on the ground, a sword ray still brushed past his face, leaving behind a shallow wound, severing a few strands of his hair.

“Lin Yun!” Ji Zixi rejoiced as she raised her head. Lin Yun had unleashed the sword ray with a flick of his hand.

The Iris Saint Seal had bloomed on the back of Lin Yun’s hand as the three thousand ribbons that had manifested with sword intent soared to the sky like beams of light. It was shocking to see three thousand ribbons soaring to the sky, appearing to be wanting to drag the sky down. This gave everyone the wrong impression that Lin Yun could drag the sky down with the three thousand ribbons anytime.

“You!” Zhao Tianyu touched his face with murderous intent flashing through his eyes.

“Someone like you wants to ruin my plan?” Zhao Tianyu patted on the ground and soared to the sky, reaching for Ji Zixi.

Seeing this, Lin Yun calmly circulated the Great Profound Sword Canon and three swords appeared behind him. Once the three swords formed into the Great Profound Sword Canon, he tapped his foot on the ground.

Zhao Tianyu, who was in mid-air, was forced to turn around with a fan appearing in his hand. He opened up the fan to block the incoming sword ray. But when Zhao Tianyu looked at Lin Yun again, his gaze became terrifyingly dark.

However, Lin Yun ignored Zhao Tianyu as the Great Profound Sword Canon continued to revolve, overlapping the sword images behind him. As he waved his hands, sword rays constantly shot out.

Zhao Tianyu kept dodging and was further away from the Divine Phoenix Mountain group. He could tell Lin Yun wanted to force him away, but he could do nothing about it. He could only do his best to dodge, but the incoming sword rays were too shocking. Each sword ray looked like it could shatter the stars, reaching a terrifying height.

Ji Zixi soared to the sky and heaved a sigh in relief before she grabbed onto the Divine Phoenix Mirror.

“Everyone, come with me. Flower Burial is helping us!” Ji Zixi didn’t hesitate to release the Divine Phoenix Mirror to envelop everyone as they headed towards the Flame Dragon’s skull.

“Damn it!” Zhao Tianyu was furious since he couldn’t snatch the Divine Phoenix Mirror. He roared, “Lin Yun, you ruined it for me again!”

But just when he was finished speaking, a sword ray flew over, causing Zhao Tianyu to squint as his sight became filled with the sword ray.

Lin Yun used the Myriad Swords Unite and three mountains rose behind him before he became one with the Great Profound Sword Canon, and unleashed a massive sword ray that filled heaven and earth.

Zhao Tianyu opened his mouth and quickly threw the fan away before he began to form seals. Multiple crimson moons soon rose to the sky. But the sword ray shattered all of the crimson moons that were in its path before sending Zhao Tianyu flying away at the end.

“Isn’t this a little too shocking?” Everyone in the Flame Dragon Valley could feel their scalps going numb as they watched this scene. But that wasn’t all. Lin Yun had already resorted to the Great Profound Sword Canon, unleashing a barrage of sword rays at the demonic corpses, forcing them to retreat.

“It’s him!” Everyone was shocked to see that it was Lin Yun who saved them. This was unbelievable because they were the subsidiary forces of the three holy lands. In the critical moment, the three holy lands abandoned them, while they had to be saved by the three holy lands’ enemy.

“Flower Burial, thank you for saving us.” Everyone was briefly stunned before their voices rang throughout the Flame Dragon Valley.

“Hahaha! Thank you for saving us, Flower Burial!” Qu Wushuang laughed as he led everyone from the Divine Dao Pavilion to the Flame Dragon’s skull.

The danger was briefly alleviated. The demonic corpses were dead, to begin with. Lin Yun’s sword ray could inflict heavy injuries on Saint Lords, but it couldn’t inflict any injuries on the already dead demonic corpses. After retreating, the demonic corpses roared and charged forth once more.

When Lin Yun saw this scene, he couldn’t help recalling his experience in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, thinking of the ancient secrets and cultivators who died on the battlefield back then.

The fleeting cloud isn’t my will and ten thousand years in the flick of a finger.

Lin Yun patted his chest as the intertwining sun and moon sword stars dissipated. The robe he wore also dissolved under the three thousand ribbons. He then clasped his hands together, pouring his saint aura into his hands as he manifested into a moon with moonlight shining forth.

When his sword aura reached the limit, Lin Yun spread his hands apart and the three thousand ribbons flew towards the demonic corpses in the Flame Dragon Valley. This allowed the cultivators within Flame Dragon Valley to break free from the demonic corpses and retreat with those who were injured beside them.

“This is a swordsman, having fangs and also the will to protect… like Master and the other swordsmen.” Lin Yun acquired insight as his Divine Light Sword Intent rapidly improved—Eight thousand years of reign with our halo enveloping ninety thousand miles. As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies!

Lin Yun soared to the sky and roared, “Descend!”

A shocking scene occurred as three thousand ribbons streaked across the horizon and descended.
