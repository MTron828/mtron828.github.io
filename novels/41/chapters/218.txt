Chapter 219 - Aquacloud Spiritual Rune

Lin Yun’s domineering declaration made Ku Yun and Li Wuyou’s blood boil. Feeling eager to take revenge against Liu Yue and Fu Guang, Li Wuyou asked, “Big brother, just tell me what to do!”

But clearly, it was unrealistic. Lin Yun patted Li Wuyou’s on the shoulder and smiled, “You only need to help out. We still have to rely on Master Ku Yun for this one.”

Li Wuyou didn’t doubt Lin Yun’s words. Turning to Ku Yun, he smiled, “Master, just let me know if there’s any dirty work. I’ll be on call any time!”

Li Wuyou’s words made Ku Yun feel embarrassed. Then, Lin Yun took out a Greater Profound Pellet and asked, “Master, this is a Greater Profound Pellet refined by you. If I remember correctly, it only has some elementary spiritual runes inscribed on it, right?”

“My Greater Profound Pellets can only be considered average. It has about 50% effects.” Ku Yun nodded.

“Why 50%?” Li Wuyou was baffled.

“During the process of refining the pellet, it’s difficult to avoid the loss of herbal effect no matter how skillful you are. Normally, the pellet will lose about 70% of its effects when it is refined. But you can rely on inscribing spiritual runes to reduce the loss of herbal effect,” Ku Yun explained.

Lin Yun naturally understood the simple logic behind alchemy after spending three days in the Alchemy Chamber with Ku Yun. He asked, “What about the Greater Profound Pellets refined by Fu Guang?”

“70%!” Ku Yun replied with a solemn expression. “That is already the limit of a Greater Profound Pellet. The Aquacloud Spiritual Rune inscribed by him can retain 70% of the herbal effect. Naturally, it poses a great appeal to cultivators in the Profound Martial Realm.”

“Aquacloud Spiritual Rune? Do you know how to inscribe it?” Lin Yun asked. He had searched the spiritual runes available in the Age Sutra, but there wasn’t an Aquacloud Spiritual Rune.

“I can inscribe it, but my success rate isn’t high. The difficulty of the Aquacloud Spiritual Rune and Firecloud Spiritual Rune is about the same level. You can be considered a two star alchemist once you master it,” Ku Yun replied reluctantly.

“Fu Guang isn’t just good at the Aquacloud Spiritual Rune, but he also has a high attainment in it. In terms of the Aquacloud Spiritual Rune, there are no more than three people who are better than him in the capital.”

“Is that so?” Lin Yun asked, “Can you show it to me?”

Ku Yun nodded. Pulling out a piece of spiritual paper, he took out a brand new Spiritual Rune Brush and dipped it in ink made of demonic beast’s blood. He then took out a jade strip and started drawing on the paper with a grave expression.

After a while, his forehead was covered in sweat. The elementary spiritual runes were a mess and it wasn’t possible to recognize them as a whole. Looking at the example, Lin Yun shook his head and spoke up, “Let me try.”

Ku Yun instantly felt relieved and handed the Spiritual Rune Brush and jade strip to Lin Yun. Placing the jade strip on his forehead, the Aquacloud Spiritual Rune appeared in Lin Yun’s mind. It was constructed with thousands of elementary spiritual runes.

The Aquacloud Spiritual Rune might feel tranquil, but it’s actually more complicated than the violet Firecloud Spiritual Rune. No wonder Ku Yun wasn’t able to inscribe it. Lin Yun closed his eyes to remember every single detail of the Aquacloud Spiritual Rune. When he opened his eyes, he placed the jade strip back on the table.

Ku Yun was shocked when he saw this scene. Lin Yun memorized it with just a glance? The Aquacloud Spiritual Rune was complex. The transition alone from water to cloud was difficult enough. But when he saw Lin Yun grab the brush, he immediately held his breath and did not dare to speak.

Lin Yun wore a serious expression and started drawing elementary spiritual runes with the brush. The concentration shown by Lin Yun was picturesque.

Under his vigorous strokes, the elementary spiritual runes began to take form, flowing smoothly. With the infusion of the age energy, the elementary spiritual runes were brimming with spiritual energy.

“Done!” Lin Yun finished the final stroke and completed the Aquacloud Spiritual Rune. The rune looked like a combination of water and cloud.

“Wow!” Li Wuyou exclaimed out.

Even Ku Yun looked excited. He patted Li Wuyou on the shoulder, “Don’t just stand there. Start the fire to refine pellets!”

The two of them immediately started working. Ku Yun would be responsible for refining pellets, while Li Wuyou would handle the miscellaneous work. As for Lin Yun, he would focus on inscribing spiritual runes alone.

The three of them didn’t get a wink of sleep so they were completely exhausted. But they were excited when they looked at the thirty glittering pellets on the table. Pursing his lips, Li Wuyou asked, “Master, how much do you think we’re going to price our Greater Profound Pellets at?”

“Ordinary Greater Profound Pellets cost ten spiritual jades and the ones I refined should be thirty spiritual jades. As for Fu Guang, his cost a hundred spiritual jades.” Fu Guang scratched his head.

Fu Guang’s pellets instantly cost ten times the price, which made Li Wuyou surprised. But Lin Yun reacted to it calmly. After all, how could ordinary Greater Profound Pellets compare to one with the Aquacloud Spiritual Rune inscribed on it? Not to mention that Fu Guang’s pellets were so popular that they would be instantly brought out.

Looking at Lin Yun, Ku Yun asked carefully, “Little Master, what do you think is an appropriate price for our Greater Profound Pellets?”

“How about a hundred spiritual jades?” Lin Yun asked nervously. He had his own pride and he was confident that his Greater Profound Pellet wouldn’t be any worse than Fu Guang’s. After all, he would be looking down on himself if the price was lower than Fu Guang.

“Is that appropriate?” Ku Yun was also feeling a little nervous. After all, it would be embarrassing if he couldn’t sell it. On the other hand, Li Wuyou was experiencing a huge shock. If they were really sold, then it would be a huge sum of 3,000 spiritual jades. Even after splitting it with the Myriad Treasure Pavilion, they would still get about 900 spiritual jades.

This was just one night’s worth of work. If this continued for half a month, Lin Yun would accumulate enough resources to cultivate. But could these pellets really be sold for such a high price?

“Master, how are you doing with refining pellets?” A voice sounded out. It was Hall Master Wei, the person-in-charge of the Myriad Treasure Pavilion.

When they entered, Ku Yun handed a porcelain bottle over and replied, “30 Greater Profound Pellets here. As for the price, it will be 100 spiritual jades for one.”

“You’re pretty efficient to refine thirty Greater Profound Pellets in a single night… Wait, how much did you say?” Hall Master Wei was shocked. Did he listen correctly? 100 spiritual jades for one pellet? The price for Greater Profound Pellets might be high recently, but not this inflated.

Toughening his scalp, Ku Yun acknowledged him, “That’s right. You didn’t hear incorrectly.”

“Okay. But the Myriad Treasure Pavilion can only sell it at the market price if it’s not being sold,” Hall Master Wei smiled, despite the doubt he felt.

“Certainly,” responded Ku Yun.

Hall Master Wei did not continue and left the room after putting on the label.

Suddenly, Ku Yun turned to look at Lin Yun, “What are we going to do now?”

“Sleep.” Lin Yun replied calmly. “We’ll just leave it to fate.”

They instantly fell asleep on the floor from the exhaustion.

In the Glittering Pavilion, Hall Master Mo had a meeting with Liu Yue and Fu Guang, who had just woken up. Raising his cup, Hall Master Mo smiled, “Master, did you rest well?”

“It wasn’t bad,” Fu Guang replied casually. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“This time, the Glittering Pavilion has stocked 300,000 Greater Profound Pellets. We’ll be depending on you to help us sell them,” Hall Master Mo smiled.

Fu Guang pridefully replied, “With my reputation alone, I guarantee that you would sell out even if you had a million of them in stock.”

Hall Master Mo was overjoyed. He replied, “Then please go into seclusion for ten days. The Glittering Pavilion will start building up the momentum for you. Ten days later, I’ll make sure that everyone in the capital knows that you’re here!”

Fu Guang nodded his head silently. He was experienced with this kind of scene to the point that he was already numb to it.
