Chapter 1602 - Entering the Ancient Barren Battlefield

Lin Yun’s words immediately made Liu Xu and Yan Kong lose their composure, and their smiles froze on their faces. Although the Sword Sect suffered terribly two decades ago, the Profound Sky Sect didn’t have it easy either because Jian Jingtian slaughtered thousands of their inner disciples, and many elders were disabled.

It was a fact that the Profound Sky Sect was greatly humiliated at that time. No matter how Liu Xu and Yan Kong tried to mock them, it was undeniable that Jian Jingtian was protected by the Radiant Sword Saint back then.

When the two nearly lost it, Qin Tian stopped them and smiled, “Looks like the Sword Sect hasn’t learned their lesson from what happened two decades ago. But it doesn’t matter because we’ll let you guys know the true meaning of cruelty in this Ancient Barren Battlefield!”

His voice was calm without a hint of killing intent. But the meaning of his words made everyone feel a chill run down their spines because the Profound Sky Sect wasn’t planning to let the Sword Sect go this time.

“We will see, then!” Gu Ruochen took a step forth beside Lin Yun.

Qin Tian pursed his lips together as he walked over, which made all the Sword Sect’s disciples nervous. Even Chen Lei and Mu Chuan had their brows furrowed together. This made them wonder if Qin Tian was planning to make a move before entering the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

When Qin Tian walked to Gu Ruochen’s side, he whispered, “I know what you’re thinking. But don’t worry because you won’t be able to protect any of them. Jian Jingtian couldn’t protect everyone back then, and now, neither can you. I will kill Lin Yun before you. Even if he’s the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, he will still die!”

His words made Gu Ruochen’s face ugly. But Qin Tian stepped back when he was done and looked at the Sword Sect’s disciples, “You guys don’t have to be nervous because I’m just having a friendly chat with Brother Gu. Let’s go!”

When the Profound Sky Sect left, the surrounding tension calmed down, but everyone knew that the Sword Sect was doomed.

“Ha. The Radiant Sword Saint is already old, and they’re still not obedient.”

“They’re really not afraid of death. They haven’t learned their lesson from two decades ago…”

“Who knows what these people are thinking? Did they really think that they could confront the Profound Sky Sect?”

“Once the Radiant Sword Saint dies, the Sword Sect will be finished.” Many sects with a good relationship with the Profound Sky Sect whispered, mocking the Sword Sect.

“What did he say?” Lin Yun asked Gu Ruochen.

“You don’t need to care about what he said. He’s just an enemy.” Gu Ruochen smiled, but Lin Yun knew that Qin Tian definitely didn’t say anything good. After all, Gu Ruochen’s mentality was affected by Qin Tian’s earlier words.

“The Ancient Barren Battlefield is starting!” Mu Xueqin suddenly said. When everyone raised their heads, the distant vortex had become thin, and the surrounding barrier also began to weaken.

The eyes of everyone on the plain became heated when they saw this scene because the Ancient Barren Battlefield was about to start. The Ancient Barren Battlefield was famous in not only the Ancient Barren Domain, but even in the whole Eastern Desolation. The powerhouses from the Saint Alliance had sealed it.

Initially, the spiritual array would loosen once every hundred years from the erosion of time. Now, the spiritual array would loosen every two decades, and that was the battlefield among deities. The Saint Palace left behind by the Dragon Gate was located there.

Countless experts fell on that battlefield, and there were innumerable treasures and techniques of the Dragon Gate. So the moment the seal loosened, no one would give up on this opportunity. But this opportunity was controlled by the eight powerful sects, and the forces from the other domains didn’t have many chances.

Even holy lands wouldn’t dare to act recklessly because of the Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng’s name. As for the other powerhouses, no one dared to make a move as long as the Radiant Sword Saint was still alive.

“It’s finally going to begin…” Lin Yun’s pupils were curious as he looked at the vortex. He was really curious about the battlefield, the battle between deities, the Dragon Gate, the Nine Emperors, and the fiends.

Regardless of the Kunlun Realm or the Profound Amber Realm, all the ruins he experienced were practically related to the Dragon Gate and fiends. It was so much so that even the Iris Sword Saint had a close connection to the Dragon Gate.

“When we enter the Ancient Barren Battlefield, we will be randomly teleported. Remain calm and use your medal to search for fellow disciples near you and gather together. Only release the rescue signal at a crucial time.” Gu Ruochen said with a grave expression. “Remember, don’t release the signal to soon because the other sects will be able to see it as well, and you guys might run into enemies before allies.”

“Yes.” The Sword Sect’s disciples said nervously. Even without the other powerful sects, the Ancient Barren Battlefield was dangerous, and they would die if they weren’t careful.

Gu Ruochen continued to give them instructions. In the depths of the Ancient Barren Battlefield, there was an altar. They could only stay in the Ancient Barren Battlefield for two months, at best, and they would have to be teleported out through the altar after two months because the demonic aura lingering on the battlefield could kill them should the demonic aura accumulate within their bodies.

While everyone was talking amongst themselves, the vortex finally became dim, and one could see into the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Shortly after, everyone flew towards the vortex. Since there were over a hundred thousand people gathered here, the phenomena caused by them was terrifying.

“Let’s go!” Gu Ruochen walked forth, seeing this with the Sword Sect’s disciples following behind him. As waves of powerful dragon origin spread, they all flew towards the vortex. When they entered the vortex, Lin Yun immediately felt that he had lost control of his body, with the surroundings blurring and spinning. The vortex was like an ocean; everyone was instantly, forcefully separated when they passed through it.

On the plain outside, Chen Lei and the other peak masters watched as the Sword Sect’s disciples disappeared into the vortex. When they exchanged glances, they could see the anxiety in each other’s eyes.

“Qin Tian’s aura is a little strong. He can suppress even Gu Ruochen.” Chen Lei said softly.

“He’s not old, but his mentality far exceeds his peers.”

“He’s a little terrifying.” The other peak masters nodded and weren’t too optimistic about this Ancient Barren Battlefield.

“We still have Lin Yun. I feel that Lin Yun isn’t intimidated by him.” Mu Chuan said.

“That lad is pretty good. But his cultivation is on the lower side. As long as he can obtain some opportunities in this Ancient Barren Battlefield and survive, he might be able to reach Martial Uncle Radiant’s height.” Chen Lei smiled. As they spoke, they would never have expected that the uproar caused by this Ancient Barren Battlefield would far exceed everyone’s expectations.

A long time later, after Lin Yun’s vision returned to normal, he discovered that he was hovering in the air and many people were descending like rain. The ground was black but gave off a terrifying aura, as if the earth was alive. The sky was also pitch black, and nothing could be seen; there were no clouds or stars.

This was the most bizarre place that Lin Yun had seen. There wasn’t a strand of vitality in this place, and he could even hear the occasional terrifying roar.

“This is the deities’ battlefield from back then?” Lin Yun landed on the ground and looked around.

There were many people in the area who were curious about their surroundings. Everyone was randomly teleported when they entered the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and Lin Yun immediately took out the medal to see if there were any Sword Sect’s disciples near him. Since he didn’t know anyone there, he naturally wanted to gather with someone by instinct.

“We must be careful here because we might be in danger at any moment.”

“That’s right. But there won’t be any treasures at the boundary of the Ancient Barren Battlefield. We don’t have to fight here; we can talk about it after heading out!”

“I heard that the boundary will be a completely different scenery. You can find divine springs, herbal fields, and various treasures.” Someone said, trying to prevent everyone from fighting amongst themselves.

Lin Yun naturally had no opinion, but he furrowed his brows and soared to the sky. That was his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent warning him, and his body reacted by instinct before his thoughts could follow.

“Watch out!”

But his warning was already too late. The ground rumbled, and a terrifying ravine opened up. Ten-odd demonic beasts crawled out of the ground. They were black and swiftly merged into the surroundings. Only their crimson pupils could be seen.

When the ground crumbled, the demonic beasts began slaughtering anyone they saw. This caught many people by surprise, and the demonic beasts tore them apart.

“It’s the Ancient Barren Demonic Scorpion! Flee!” Someone recognized the demonic beasts and immediately fled. This person didn’t even think about trying to retaliate.

Everyone who was thinking of joining hands earlier instantly became a mess. Ten-odd people died terribly in just a few breaths, and only a few managed to flee, relying on saint artifacts.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Lin Yun wanted to make a move, but he was too late. Just when his thoughts were uneasy, the Ancient Barren Demonic Scorpions’ shells broke apart, and a pair of wings appeared. Since Lin Yun didn’t move, this made him an easy target, and the scorpions flew towards him.

Their wings produced terrifying buzzing noises with faint fluctuations rippling out in the air. Lin Yun furrowed his brow because he had never expected to run into such a troublesome demonic beast when he had just entered the Ancient Barren Battlefield. This was only the beginning, and this made him frown even further. If he had already encountered such troublesome opponents the moment he entered, what about the other Sword Sect’s disciples?

“Empress…” Lin Yun yelled by habit, but he soon realized Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red weren’t around. The three of them had always stuck together, but he was all alone now. Before he could reminisce further, several Ancient Barren Demonic Scorpions already flew over.

Since these demonic beasts wanted a fight, he would give them a fight. As killing intent flashed across his pupils, he circulated his Divine Firmament Sword Sutra and dashed forth.
