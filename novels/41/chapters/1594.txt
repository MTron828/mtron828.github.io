Chapter 1595 - Returning to the Sect

Lin Yun was surprised that the Flower Burial Sword was hovering in the air. In the past, when he summoned his sword or threw it out, he usually controlled it with his dragon origin, and it could only go in one direction most of the time. This was like pulling a rock from a distance away by creating a suction force with astral energy or dragon origin.

Due to the strong connection with the Flower Burial Sword, and the sword possessing spiritual energy, he could control it as he wished, most of the time. But it was bizarre this time because he could control the sword as he wanted without using his dragon origin. The sword would move according to his will, and waves of powerful aura were being emitted from it; even the surrounding area began to tremble under the immense pressure.

With a single thought, the Flower Burial Sword flew a thousand meters out while Lin Yun stood in the original position without moving. As sword rays intertwined before him, the air was like a painting torn apart by this sword rays. Under these attempts, he could reach ten miles away. Further than that, the sword’s power would significantly decrease.

But what made him feel even more bizarre was that the sword was like a pair of eyes, and he could see the surroundings of the sword by using it as a medium. It wasn’t just a simple manifestation of the surrounding terrains in his mind; it felt like he had another pair of eyes.

“This is possible?” Lin Yun was first surprised before he rejoiced, and he now had a deeper understanding of being one with the sword. After his sword intent reached the fifth grade, the sword wasn’t only a weapon, but had also become a part of his sword dao. It might sound profound, but putting it in a nutshell, his sword had become a part of him.

His sword was like his own arm, and he could control it as he wished, just like how he could move his arm. This meant that the sword was an extension of his body. Waving his hand, he summoned the sword back to him, “Come back!”

His gaze fell onto the Flower Burial Sword because sword manipulation was nothing special when suppressing his opponent with the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. If he ran into an enemy that could resist his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, it wouldn’t be easy to kill his opponent by manipulating the sword.

This made him think of something. I am the sky, my sword as the dome, and I’m one with the sword.

Since the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent was so difficult to comprehend, it shouldn’t be that simple. He should be able to execute sword techniques through sword manipulation. After all, sky and dome should be one for the fifth-grade sword intent to be called Heavenly Dome.

With a single thought, the Flower Burial Sword flew out. When the sword was ten miles away, Lin Yun remained in the same position while performing the first form of the Aquaheaven Sword Form, “Endless Clouds!”

As the sword aura swept out from the Flower Burial Sword, the sword unleashed forty-nine sword rays in the blink of an eye, and the intent of this sword technique was perfect. This made Lin Yun squint his eyes because ten miles away was filled with his sword rays.

Lin Yun remained on the spot and used his fingers as a sword to execute the second form of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique. When the clouds dissipated, a lake appeared beneath Lin Yun with a moon hanging high in the sky. The Flower Burial Sword also looked like someone was wielding it to perfectly unleash this sword's intent.

Pricking Moon!

Rising Clouds!

Serene Aquasky!

Soaring White Clouds!

As Lin Yun’s movements gradually sped up, the Flower Burial Sword reached an unbelievable speed and countless sword rays were dazzling as various phenomena appeared on Lin Yun and the Flower Burial Sword. They were overlapping, even when they were ten miles apart. Lin Yun executed the entire Aquaheaven Sword Technique in just a few breaths.

“I see…” Lin Yun’s mind suddenly cleared up, and his attainment in the sword reached an unprecedented height. His master once said that he had to know if he was wielding the sword or the sword was wielding him, and he knew what it meant now.

He could wield the sword and vice-versa. He finally knew the true meaning of being one with the sword. When he raised his head to look at the Flower Burial Sword, the sword was flickering with a cold light while looking back at him.

At this moment, Lin Yun could see himself through the Flower Burial Sword’s eyes. He was donned in an azure robe, carrying a sword box on his back, and the purple diamond mark on his forehead was striking, which made him look devilish.

Come back! A sudden burst of power exploded from the Flower Burial Sword, and Lin Yun lost control of his body, flying towards the Flower Burial Sword. He became one with his sword when he held onto the Flower Burial Sword. It wasn’t Lin Yun who summoned the sword over, but the sword had summoned him; the sword was wielding him now.

When he grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword, a vibration echoed within his mind, and he could sense his blood flowing from his palm into the sword. As his blood poured into the sword, there seemed to be a layer of ice on the surface, melting and finally revealing its actual appearance.

As the ice melted, the Flower Burial Sword became even more striking and unleashed an unprecedented sharpness. The Flower Burial Sword had undergone a rebirth, as if it had been finely sharpened.

Simultaneously, saint runes began to bloom on the sword like flowers. The sword's sharpness reached a new height when the ice fully melted. The entire sword was gorgeous, like snow flickering with a cold light.

A seal shone brightly on the sword, making Lin Yun close his eyes by instinct. When he opened his eyes by a small gap, he suddenly widened his eyes, seeing a dazzling radiant shine where the sword hilt and sword blade were connected. That was the glorygold of the seven glory spirits, which meant that the Flower Burial Sword was a Glory Saint Artifact!

The seven glory spirits were divided into seven attributes, gold, wood, water, fire, earth, sun, and moon. All seven glory spirits were equal and were only different in terms of attributes. If one had to ask if any of the glory spirits stood out, it would be the glorysun and glorymoon spirits, and they were also harder to execute.

With glorygold engraved on a weapon, it would increase the sharpness of the weapon. Looking at the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun felt as though he had just understood it. He never expected that it would be a Glory Saint Artifact.

“Let’s give it a try!” Lin Yun briefly pondered and took out an ordinary thousand-rune saint artifact from his interspatial bracelet. Lin Yun managed to leave a nick on the surface of that thousand-rune saint artifact without activating the glory spirit on the Flower Burial Sword.

This made his eyes light up because the Flower Burial Sword was much stronger than before. He didn’t even circulate his dragon origin or sword intent, just purely relied on the sharpness of the Flower Burial Sword to leave a nick on the thousand-rune saint artifact.

“Let’s give it another try!” This time, Lin Yun activated the Glorygold Spirit on the Flower Burial Sword, easily splitting the thousand-rune saint artifact into two; the cut was smooth.

But before Lin Yun could rejoice, the world began to spin within his eyes as exhaustion swept over him. Using a Glory Saint Spirit was challenging, and the fatigue was even higher than the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. Then again, this was also related to the fact that there were still three layers of seal on the umbrella.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun sat down and briefly recovered before opening his eyes. Sweeping his gaze over the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling because it had given him a huge surprise.

Lin Yun didn’t waste the remaining time and fused the four ominous auras into the four sword forms. When he was done fusing them, three days had already passed. Three figures streaked across the horizon when Lin Yun was about to get up.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Senior Brother Mu Chuan, Mu Xueqin, and Chen Ling. The other two should be the reinforcements that Chen Ling found. When they saw Lin Yun, they were briefly stunned before they rejoiced.

“Where’s Jiang Tong and the others?” Mu Xueqin quickly asked.

“Dead.”

“Dead?” Mu Chuan’s group of three exchanged glances before they looked at Lin Yun with shock.

Lin Yun briefly pondered before shoving it all on the Black Turtle Ancestor. When the three heard about the Black Turtle Ancestor, they no longer dwelled in it, and Mu Xueqin patted her chest with lingering fear. “Luckily, you’re fine, or I’d become a sinner.”

She was nervous when she heard Chen Ling’s explanation, fearing Lin Yun might’ve been in danger.

“Haha. Senior Sister, look.” Lin Yun smiled as he retrieved the last Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood.

“You got it!” Mu Xueqin rejoiced.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun nodded. “It was a fortune in disguise. The Black Turtle Ancestor gave me this Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood, and it’s much more precious than that Heavenly Profound Tortoise’s Saint Blood.”

When they talked, Mu Chuan didn’t say a word from the side because he had already noticed that Lin Yun had made a breakthrough. Not only did he make a breakthrough, but he gave Mu Chuan a unique feeling. Most importantly, he could sense a faint pressure coming from Lin Yun, which made Mu Chuan wonder what opportunity he had obtained to even make him feel pressured.

“Let’s return to the sect.” Mu Xueqin said.

After Lin Yun nodded his head, they started making their way back to the Sword Sect. This time, Mu Chuan made a move and began bringing them back with his cultivation at the Samsara Edict Realm since his speed was faster than Lin Yun and the others.

“Senior Brother, wait for me a little.” Lin Yun called out when they got close to the Demonic Rune Tiger’s den. He briefly looked at the damaged Divine Dragon Monument before taking it away.

This monument definitely had a huge origin. If he could find the second half, the value would be unimaginable. But even if it was only half, it was already valuable. In the future, when he practiced the Sovereign Dragon Fist, it would be much faster with the help of this monument.

He placed the monument into the secret realm in the sword box before gathering up with Mu Chuan an hour later. When they returned to the sect, Mu Chuan got rid of Mu Xueqin and Chen Ling before turning to Lin Yun, “You come with me.”

“What’s the matter?” Lin Yun asked.

“The sect master wants to see you.” Mu Chuan led the way and soon arrived at the main hall with Mu Xuankong already waiting there.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw a slight change in Mu Xuankong’s expression, and he instantly knew that the latter probably sensed the transformation in his sword intent.

“I already brought him here. You guys can talk amongst yourselves. I’ll leave, first.” Mu Chuan sighed, looking at Lin Yun before he left.

Lin Yun’s keen sense picked it up, and he instantly knew that this meeting wouldn’t be simple.
