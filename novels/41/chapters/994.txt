Chapter 995 - More Opportunities

“What’s the matter? You don’t believe me?” Jiang Ling smiled at the shocked expression on Lin Yun’s face. “You can give it a try again if you don’t believe it.”

“No need, no need,” said Lin Yun. He didn’t want to face that power once more. Now that he thought about it, he was a little too rash to declare that he wanted to test Jiang Ling’s strength. But he was fortunate that Jiang Ling didn’t lower himself to his level.

“At least you’re tactful. I have tons of ways to deal with you,” snorted Jiang Ling. This made Lin Yun smile awkwardly because Jiang Ling was still as arrogant as before.

“The Azure Dragon Grab was also called the Azure Dragon Star Shattering Grab in ancient times. Upon reaching a high enough level, it wouldn’t be difficult to crush a star. However, you need to grasp thunderstorm energy and possess the azure dragon aura. This martial technique has very strict requirements.”

Lin Yun listened to what Jiang Ling said seriously and didn’t dare to miss any part of the explanation.

“You first have to spread out the lightning energy. Then, you add wind to form a vortex. Keep in mind that the vortex must have five invisible colors. Otherwise, anyone can attack the flaw. Look carefully. I’m only going to perform it once for you. How much you can comprehend will depend on you.” Jiang Ling had no change on his face as an azure dragon’s head appeared behind him.

But because he was demonstrating it for Lin Yun, his movement was slow. He was allowing Lin Yun to see every single detail. First, he used the dragon aura to restrict the entire space. Then, he used lightning intent to empower it. Next, he merged his wind intent with the lightning to create a massive vortex.

“So that’s why I got pulled in.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he pondered his past experience.

“How was it? Did you manage to see it clearly?” Jiang Ling smiled.

“It’s still alright.” Lin Yun didn’t determine it right from the start because it didn’t seem to be as difficult as he had imagined.

“Then come and give it a try. You’ve grasped the azure dragon sword aura and even merged with the Azure Dragon True Bone. You should barely be able to use it after practicing for half a day,” said Jiang Ling while transmitting the technique to Lin Yun.

Lin Yun engraved the martial technique in his mind and closed his eyes. He wasn’t in a hurry to give it a try, but reviewed Jiang Ling’s movements. With his exceptional comprehension, he remembered every single detail well.

After merging the scenes of Jiang Ling’s attack and teaching session in his mind, Lin Yun started to make swift progress. Half an hour later, Lin Yun opened his eyes with a light flashing through his pupils.

“Are you confident in using it now?” Jiang Ling looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile because he knew that it would be interesting to watch.

“A little…” Lin Yun circulated the sutra of this martial technique in his mind along with all his origin energy and azure dragon aura. But unlike Jiang Ling, Lin Yun’s dragon aura also contained a sword aura that was unique to him.

Under the pressure from the azure dragon sword aura, the surroundings were instantly restricted. Lin Yun smiled because everything was going smoother than he thought it would have. But before he could rejoice, the rune engraved in the Azure Dragon True Bone shined brightly and filled his body.

In the next second, a massive azure dragon’s head appeared behind him with golden brilliance shining from its pupils. Before Lin Yun could catch his breath, the dragon aura surged violently and made Lin Yun’s body swell to a terrifying height.

“This…” Lin Yun was surprised because he never imagined that the Azure Dragon True Bone would move by itself and enhance his dragon aura to such an unbelievable height. Vaguely, he could even sense that the dragon aura was a lot stronger than what Jiang Ling released when he was in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. It was all thanks to the Azure Dragon True Bone.

When a dragon roar echoed out, the entire palace began to tremble violently. When Jiang Ling saw this scene, he wasn’t surprised and even wore a smile, “This is just the beginning…”

Lin Yun stretched his hands as nine dragon runes moved toward his palm. Boundless lightning exploded and solidified his dragon aura to restrict the surrounding space. Lin Yun had joy in his eyes because he didn’t have to worry if his thunderstorm energy was lacking. Furthermore, he never imagined that the nine dragon runes would contain such immense power.

“Azure Dragon Grab!” Lin Yun roared and his five fingers turned into dragon claws. Just like that, the space before him shattered with a powerful shockwave that spread out in the form of purple and gold light. This martial technique was similar to his Azure Dragon Incinerating Palm, but there was a huge difference between the two. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed, “I wonder who created this secret technique. The threshold to practice this technique doesn’t seem to be too high.”

“Me,” said Jiang Ling unhappily.

When Lin Yun heard that, he immediately wore an awkward smile and replied, “The power of this secret technique is really terrifying. You didn’t lie to me. If you didn’t hold back earlier, there’s no way my sky sword intent could have broken your Azure Dragon Grab.”

“The reason why it’s so powerful is because of your Azure Dragon True Bone,” said Jiang Ling coldly. But inwardly, he couldn’t conceal his shock because the impact was too great to him. According to his speculation, even with the help of the Azure Dragon True Bone, Lin Yun still needed at least half a day to barely grasp it. But Lin Yun only needed a brief moment to reach a level similar to the attack he just used.

“The Azure Dragon True Bone!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with surprise and lingering fear whenever he thought about the terrifying power in his body.

“The Azure Dragon True Bone contains a complete divine rune with deep thunderstorm profundity, not to mention that it was left behind by an Azure Dragon King. In the future, there’s even a chance that it might grow into a dao rune…” Jiang Ling looked at Lin Yun and continued, “But you have to be cautious because your cultivation is still too low. Look at your palm.”

When Lin Yun opened his palm, he saw several wounds on his palm. His powerful vitality wanted to heal the wounds but was restricted by something.

“Do you get it? Those are the wounds left behind by the bone. The power of the divine rune can stop your opponent from healing, but it’s also the same for you,” smiled Jiang Ling.

“Doesn’t this mean that it’s useless to me?” Lin Yun said helplessly.

“You’re still a baby to the bone. You’ll know more in the future after you become proficient in it. This bone is the key to practicing the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, so you don’t have to be too anxious,” said Jiang Ling.

“I see…” Lin Yun finally felt relieved and smiled, “Senior, now that I’ve learned the Azure Dragon Grasp, do you have any sword techniques? I’m not greedy. I’ll be satisfied with a monarch fortune sword technique. Then again, I wouldn’t mind having a sword technique that surpasses fortune either.”

When Jiang Ling heard what Lin Yun said, he sneered, “I’ve seen it now. Your face is even thicker than mine. Do you think monarch fortune martial techniques can be found everywhere? Others have to get through the test to obtain it.”

“You really don’t have any?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Are you serious?!” Jiang Ling glared at Lin Yun because he had underestimated the thickness of Lin Yun’s face.

Lin Yun rubbed his nose helplessly in response because he realized that he was really a little too much.

“Don’t bother asking.” Jiang Ling folded his arms. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to give Lin Yun one, but there were rules to the palace. If Lin Yun wanted a sword technique, he would have to go through the test. Furthermore, the inheritances weren’t left behind by Jiang Ling, so he couldn’t just break the rules.

Looking at Lin Yun’s depressed state, Jiang Ling fell into deep thoughts because he knew how much a monarch fortune martial technique could help him. Collecting his thoughts, he smiled, “It looks like you haven’t truly grasped the profundity in fist and sword combined.”

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun asked.

“Since you can use your fist as a sword, why didn’t you try using the essence of the Divine Glorysun Fist in the form of a sword?” Jiang Ling replied. When Jiang Ling said that, Lin Yun heard a loud boom in his mind because he had never thought of that.

“Is it really possible?” questioned Lin Yun.

“Not without reaching the manifestation stage. But why restrict them to your fist or sword? Plus, you’ve already grasped the essence of that attack,” smiled Jiang Ling.

“Thank you, senior.” Lin Yun recovered after he recovered from his shock.

“No need to thank me. Since you’ve taken my inheritance, I hope that you won’t let me down,” said Jiang Ling. “Then again, I don’t wish to see you die so easily either. Since I can’t protect you personally, I can only leave you with a battle cloth. In the future, if someone far exceeding your cultivation tries to kill you, you can teach them a lesson on behalf of me, Azure Dragon Lord!”

Jiang Ling’s tone was indifferent, but his killing intent and domineering tone were clear to see.
