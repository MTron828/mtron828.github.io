Chapter 756 - Twists and Turns

It would be a lie to say that Lin Yun wasn’t interested in such a precious Flamedragon Fruit. But Lin Yun was smart and he knew that the Indigothunder Dragonvulture would’ve taken it if it was easy to obtain. Even after he comprehended the spiritual sword intent, there was no way he could compare to an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast.

There was probably a powerful demonic beast guarding it or it was somewhere that wasn’t easy to reach. Either way, it would be a pity if he didn’t even take a look at it.

Now that the Indigothunder Dragonvulture had recovered half of its strength, it flapped its wings and unleashed a powerful gale with lightning crackling around it. A powerful wind current lifted the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s body into the sky.

Lin Yun hair fluttered in the wind and he narrowed his eyes from shock. The Indigothunder Dragonvulture was larger than the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape, but it soared easily through the sky. This meant that the Indigothunder Dragonvulture was extremely powerful. Most likely, it had a powerful bloodline with many inheritances.

As the Indigothunder Dragonvulture flew through the sky, it left countless aerial demonic beasts trembling in fear. None of them dared to block its path, not to mention flying with it.

Half an hour later, three volcanoes appeared before them. The sky above the volcanoes was dyed red from the high temperature. It looked like they had reached a forbidden region.

“It’s in such a terrifying place?” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked as he turned around to see the clouds shrouding the surrounding mountain range. It seemed like a massive array. But he didn’t know if it was natural or if someone set up the array. Without anyone guiding him, it would have been impossible to find this place.

“Be careful.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture, who was shrouded in lightning, suddenly shot towards the three volcanoes like a sharp sword.

Sensing the incoming heatwave, Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Enneaform to defend himself from the violent aura. As his eyes flickered, he discovered many precious treasures on the three volcanoes.

It didn’t take long for him to figure out that the volcanoes must be where the Flame Dragon died back then. This was the best explanation as to why so many treasures were born here. This meant that they should be close to the three thousand years old Flamedragon Fruit.

As the Indigothunder Dragonvulture passed through the volcanoes and landed on a plain, the ground trembled. Then, it spoke “It’s up ahead.”

Lin Yun jumped off the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s back and raised his head. He could see that the sky was dyed gold about one hundred miles away and a massive flame dragon was coiled below. The crimson pupils seemed as if they could transcend space, which made Lin Yun’s body shake.

But very quickly, Lin Yun released his sword intent and tore apart the fear. Then, Lin Yun asked, “Is there a Flame Dragon guarding it?”

“Look again, but this time look carefully,” replied the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

“Hmmm?” Lin Yun poured his origin energy into his pupils and discovered that it wasn’t a genuine Flame Dragon but an image. The image of the Flame Dragon was terrifying enough to make him confuse it for reality.

“Let’s go, we can get closer.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture moved forward and stopped ten miles away from the Flame Dragon image. But from this distance, Lin Yun could see the Flamedragon Fruit clearly.

It was a fist-sized golden fruit that exuded an ancient aura. Just looking at it was enough to make Lin Yun’s heartthrob as he could sense the dense vitality in it.

“We can’t get any closer or we’ll die.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture flapped its wings and sent a huge rock flying over. As the rock flew through the air, it was incinerated.

“I’m afraid that’s not the only obstruction, right?” asked Lin Yun. After all, this alone wouldn’t be able to stop the Indigothunder Dragonvulture. The Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s physique was stronger than Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Enneaform, so it could withstand that level of flames.

“Of course not.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture then roared as the sky turned dark while a terrifying aura rose from its body. As it flapped its wings, it unleashed terrifying lightning down from the sky. However, the lightning instantly melted and disappeared when it descended.

“It’s three thousand years old and was irrigated by the Flame Dragon’s blood essence. This Flamedragon Fruit might not have developed an intelligence yet, but it still won’t be easy.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture spoke calmly as if it had tried multiple times in the past.

“It was irrigated by the Flame Dragon’s blood essence? Could it be that someone is nourishing this Flamedragon Fruit on purpose?” Lin Yun muttered to himself before his face changed. If that was true, then this meant that the person who is doing this must be the one who killed the Flame Dragon three thousand years ago. Otherwise, where did the blood essence come from?

“But didn’t they say that the swordsman had already died?”

“He’s not dead,” replied the Indigothunder Dragonvulture. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“How do you know about that?” Lin Yun thought the answer was strange. The Indigothunder Dragonvulture might have reached maturity, but there was no way that it had lived for three thousand years.

“My grandfather told me about it,” replied the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, but it didn’t give any more explanations.

Lin Yun thought this whole situation was strange. What did it mean that its grandfather told it about it? Maybe the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s grandfather witnessed the fight or maybe the memory was engravced in its bloodline.

“What’s the origin of that swordsman?” asked Lin Yun.

“I’m not sure. But my grandfather has some speculation according to his memory. That swordsman used the Sword Sect’s strongest techniques and he also admitted that he came from the Great Qin Empire.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture told Lin Yun about it honestly.

“Sword Sect’s strongest techniques? From the Great Qin Empire?” Lin Yun was shocked as he recalled that the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s ancestor, Jian Wuming, fit the two requirements perfectly. Aside from him, there was no one else who fit the requirements. As for the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, it had inherited its ancestor’s memories, not to mention that there was no need for the Indigothunder Dragonvulture to lie to him.

Did this mean that the mysterious swordsman who killed the Flame Dragon was the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s ancestor, Jian Wuming? Did that also mean that he was the one who left the sword intent on the Falling Dragon Slope? There was a high possibility that he was also the one who left behind this Flamedragon Fruit. But what shocked Lin Yun, even more, was that the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s ancestor was still alive.

“The Flamedragon Fruit will develop its intelligence soon. It will go through tribulation sooner or later. If it fails, I can try and help you. As for now, we can only leave,” said the Indigothunder Dragonvulture as it disrupted Lin Yun’s thoughts.

“I wish to give it a try,” said Lin Yun with his eyes flickering. He had no intention of leaving without giving it a try.

“Swordsman, don’t be rash. Your physique might be powerful, but it’s still weaker than us demonic beasts. I tried it once ten years ago and I nearly died,” warned the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

Lin Yun didn’t refute those words. His physique might not be able to compete with an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast, but Lin Yun didn’t intend to face it with his physique. He guessed that the flames were empowered with flame intent in the second grade or higher.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s lightning couldn’t destroy the forbidden region because its lightning intent wasn’t strong enough. Without a martial intent powerful enough, there was no way it could obtain the Flamedragon Fruit.

Listening to Lin Yun’s speculation, the Indigothunder Dragonvulture fell into silence for a long time before it asked, “You think your sword intent is powerful enough?”

“I can give it a try,” said Lin Yun as he jumped down. But before he even landed on the ground, a surge of destructive flames poured over.

Lin Yun retaliated with a powerful sword intent that shot into the sky. He was using his xiantian sword intent in complete mastery to resist the flames. When he landed on the ground, he discovered that he was standing on a sea of golden flames, which felt like he was walking on boiling magma.

Lin Yun carefully continued forward and he could sense his sword intent being scorched. In the blink of an eye, his xiantian sword intent was reduced to ten meters around him, which barely protected him. His figure flashed as his every footstep would cause terrifying flames to rise from the ground to devour him.

Suddenly, Lin Yun charged out once more with a brilliant sword hum echoing from within his body. Every step he took was dangerous and when he took seven steps forward, he was only a thousand meters away from the Flamedragon Fruit.

But right at this moment, the Flamedragon Fruit flashed with golden brilliance. Pure flame intent manifested into a flaming dragon and pounced towards Lin Yun.

“Break!” When Lin Yun drew his sword, an unprecedented sword intent appeared along with his sword. As his sword intent tore a hole in the sky, over a hundred starlights peered through the clouds, which made Lin Yun look glorious.

Lin Yun was using his spiritual sword intent at this moment and the flame dragon couldn’t approach him no matter how hard it tried. When the sword ray landed on the flame dragon, it was torn to pieces. Lin Yun soared into the sky, crossing a thousand meters in the blink of an eye and stood before the Flamedragon Fruit.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun bent down to take the Flamedragon Fruit. But suddenly, he felt an immense power coming at him, which felt like the entire sky would collapse if he touched the fruit.
