Chapter 2035 - One Sword (1)

The night was dark as Lin Yun left the Profound Maiden Courtyard and headed alone to the Celestial Purging Mountain. This was his third time here.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re here again.” An azure-clothed Quasi-Saint appeared before Lin Yun. He was the elder responsible for guarding the Celestial Purging Mountain.

Since they have met before, Lin Yun cupped his fists together as a greeting. The azure-clothed Quasi-Saint smiled, “Reaching the seventh level without anyone knowing it, you have no idea of the commotion you’ve created.”

Lin Yun smiled because everyone on ly found out he had reached the seventh level of the Celestial Purging Mountain after he left the Heavenly Dao Sect, and he didn’t know what kind of commotion he had created.

“I can climb the mountain, right?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s for sure,” the azure-clothed Quasi-Saint said. “You can climb the mountain any time you want. But are you confident that you can reach the last two levels this time?”

“I wish to give it a try,” Lin Yun said.

“It looks like you’re pretty confident. I’ll wait for your good news, then,” the azure-clothed Quasi-Saint said. He then opened the barrier protecting the Celestial Purging Mountain for Lin Yun.

As moonlight shone down, the summit of the Celestial Purging Mountain was covered in mist, which looked like a celestial realm. It didn’t take long for a celestial crane to fly down and soar to the sky with Lin Yun.

Lin Yun took out the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and played the Phoenix Heart Song. The song was beautiful, and each musical note would put one at ease.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re in a pretty good mood.” The Celestial Crane teased after sending Lin Yun to the seventh level.

The Celestial Crane spread its wings apart and transformed into an exquisite little girl. This girl was the Crane Fairy that Lin Yun had previously met on the Celestial Purging Mountain.

“Hello, Fairy,” Lin Yun smiled, before taking out a golden bead that he got from the Myriad Graves Valley, and gave it to her.

“Mhm?! It’s a treasure! I heard from my master that this bead could be used to temper the martial intent,” the Crane Fairy rejoiced, receiving the bead from Lin Yun.

“As long as you’re happy,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Speak! What do you want to know?” The Crane Fairy smiled.

“Do I have to take note of anything on the eighth and ninth levels?” Lin Yun asked.

The Crane Fairy said, “With your current sword intent, it’s easy for you to reach the eighth level. But it’s a different story if you want to reach the ninth level.”

“Emperor Sword set up the trial on the ninth level, and even my master can’t intervene with the trial,” Lin Yun said. “Is the Emperor Sword really on the ninth level?”

“The Emperor Sword isn’t on the ninth level. But there is a sword ray left behind by Emperor Sword, and the sword ray has turned into flames. It is hard to deal with, and it has a foul temper,” the Crane Fairy explained.

“Have you seen it before?” Lin Yun asked.

“I have. Anyhow, you have to be careful because I’m still rather fond of you,” the Crane Fairy said in a concerned tone.

“I’ll head out, first,” Lin Yun smiled.

As the Crane Fairy said, Lin Yun safely passed through the eighth level. In reality, those who reached lesser mastery of the Astral Sword Intent could make it through the eighth level without any difficulties. He plucked several eight-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit from the eighth level and arrived at the ninth level.

When he came to the ninth level, he was surprised to see that someone else was there. This person was standing with his hands behind him, looking extraordinary despite looking slightly sloppy.

God knew how long he hadn’t washed his grey clothes. Not only was it dirty, it even gave off a foul stench, and his hair was disheveled like grass.

Lin Yun suppressed the shock within his heart and examined this man. This man’s backbone was straight, and his hands were clean despite the dirt on his clothes. His hands looked like pearly-white jade.

When he stepped within ten feet of that man, he instantly felt a blazing aura coming from him. This man was giving a powerful heatwave like a sun, and he couldn’t get close to this person.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Senior?” Lin Yun tried to probe this person.

“How did I become a senior?” That person turned around. But his beard grew wildly on his face like wild grass. The beard on his chin reached as long as half a meter and it looked like a black ball was covering his face.

While Lin Yun was examining this person, this person was examining him. His pupils were bright and sharp, containing an unimaginable power.

While this person looked at Lin Yun, Lin Yun could hear a sword being unsheathed with a murderous aura spreading out. This made Lin Yun feel a little fearful. If this person wasn’t a senior, he must be a saint disciple. But Lin Yun never expected that there would be such an expert within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Senior Brother, what are you doing here?” Lin Yun asked.

“I’m naturally here waiting for you. Otherwise, do you think I’m here to enjoy the scenery?” The bearded youth smiled. “When I returned, I heard that there’s a genius swordsman within the sect. Not only did he obtain three strands of the azure dragon sacred flames, but he has even reached the seventh level of the Celestial Purging Mountain.

“Some people also say that you’ve grasped the Astral Sword Intent and became first on the King Ranking. So I naturally came here to meet you,” the bearded youth said.

Lin Yun frowned. He knew that there were many crouching tigers and hidden dragons within the sect, and that there were many golden-generation geniuses. As for saint disciples at the Quasi-Saint Realm, most of them weren’t in the sect. So could this person be a genius who was secretly nurtured within the sect? Someone like the Heavenly Sword or Dao Sword’s successor.

Lin Yun waited for the bearded youth’s reply. But the bearded youth didn’t answer and merely examined him as if he wanted to see how Lin Yun would climb the ninth level of the mountain.

This made Lin Yun mutter to himself as he stepped forth to climb the ninth level. There was a painting hovering before him for the first trial of the ninth level. The painting shone brightly with a terrifying power contained within it. When Lin Yun took a step, the painting unfolded, and a white-clothed swordsman appeared.

The white-clothed swordsman merely raised his head, and the gaze alone was enough to put great pressure on Lin Yun. The white-clothed man said, “Come at me if you want to make it through this trial.”

The white-clothed man reached out and unsheathed a saint sword.

Seeing this, Lin Yun no longer hesitated and unsheathed the Flower Burial Sword, pouring the nirvana aura within his body into the sword.

When Lin Yun drew his sword, his aura became powerful, with sword rays enveloping him. The sword rays felt like real weapons as they clashed, producing a series of crisp collisions.
