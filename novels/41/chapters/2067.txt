Chapter 2068: I'm Not Acting

When the sun set, everyone began to leave. But when night came, Nether Ethereal City was in an uproar, with everyone discussing what happened during the day. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Qingtian didn’t belong to the Sword Alliance, but his strength convinced everyone. What happened during the day was deeply engraved in their minds, and they might not be able to finish discussing it even after three days and nights.

It wouldn’t take long for today’s battle to spread throughout the Southern Border before sweeping through the Kunlun Realm like a wildfire, just like Jian Jingtian’s name. The Sword Assembly might have ended, but everyone knew the real highlight was three days from now. No one expected Ye Qingtian to challenge Feng Shaoyu three days later. After all, Feng Shaoyu was a Quasi-Saint.

It was fine if it was an ordinary Quasi-Saint, but Feng Shaoyu was the Hidden Sword Manor’s Young Manor Master. The cultivation techniques, resources, and talent weren’t something ordinary people could compare with. When a genius of this level reached the Quasi-Saint Realm, he would undergo an unimaginable transformation.

There was a huge difference between the Quasi-Saint Realm and the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. Ye Qingtian could rely on his talent and foundation to defeat Gu Zijing, who was two transformations higher than him, but it was practically impossible for him to defeat someone at the Quasi-Saint Realm.

The Quasi-Saint Realm was different because it was on the saint path. Even an ordinary Quasi-Saint could suppress someone at the Nirvana Stage, and this was because the saint aura was too terrifying. The saint aura was practically invincible against someone at the Nirvana Stage, and this had nothing to do with someone’s talent in sword dao. It was impossible to even put up a fight if it was a Quasi-Saint reaching the Indigo Origin Phase.

In the Heavenly Dao Sect’s branch, Lin Yun sat on a stone mound with his eyes closed, circulating the?Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon to absorb the spiritual energy in the surroundings. As he absorbed the spiritual energy into his body, a dragon and a phoenix coiled around him with his nirvana aura being tempered.

.

When the dragon and the phoenix returned to his body, Lin Yun opened his eyes and breathed out. He could not reach the seventh stage in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon anytime soon, and the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra was also stuck at the pinnacle eleventh stage.

It wasn’t easy for him to make a breakthrough in his strength within three days. But he could try and make a breakthrough in his cultivation because he had stayed at the pinnacle seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage for a long time. So it shouldn’t be an issue for him to reach the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage in three days.

Aside from that, he also had three trump cards. First, he had condensed two sword stars after his Astral Sword Intent reached greater mastery. He could manifest thirty-six galaxies if he summoned the sun and moon sword stars. This powerful trump card could allow him to transcend the difference in cultivation, injuring Quasi-Saints at the Azure Origin Phase.

Second would be the Divine Firefly Sword. He saw Yu Qingfeng’s explanation and understood the intent contained within it. Others only knew he had mastered nine sword forms, but he had already mastered all thirteen, reaching greater mastery in the entire sword technique.

His last trump card would be the Sword of the Beginning. That was a sword technique that belonged to him. Although he only mastered the first sword form, it was still his greatest trump card. But Lin Yun wouldn’t use it if he wasn’t forced into a dead end because the sword was too fast, and even he couldn’t control it. So he couldn’t hold back his attack once he unleashed it.

If he unleashed it, there would only be two outcomes. Either he kills Feng Shaoyu or loses the fight because of the great exhaustion.

“That fellow is really strong…” Lin Yun recalled the sword ray unleashed by Feng Shaoyu. There was no question that Feng Shaoyu would be his greatest opponent on this trip to the Southern Border.

Suddenly, Lin Yun was surprised as he raised his head to look at the Indigothunder Quasi-Saint standing by the entrance.

“Peak Master, is there anything?” Lin Yun came forth with a smile.

“You have a big heart to still laugh now,” the Indigothunder Peak Master sighed.

“It’s just a Quasi-Saint. It’s not like I haven’t killed one before,” Lin Yun said. But he knew there was no way the Quasi-Saint he killed could be compared to Feng Shaoyu. He was lucky to kill that Quasi-Saint at Six Holy City.

“Feng Shaoyu isn’t the same as that Quasi-Saint from the Ming Cult,” the Indigothunder Peak Master said with a grave expression.

“Aren’t they both at the Azure Origin Phase?” Lin Yun asked.

“Why are you so determined to get Cauldron?” the Indigothunder Peak Master smiled helplessly. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint didn’t tell him the purpose of this trip. But in his view, it was already outstanding for Ye Qingtian to become champion of the Sword Assembly. There was no need for Ye Qingtian to take any more risks. After all, not only would Ye Qingtian lose his championship if he lost, but he might even lose his life.

“I have a reason to take it no matter what,” Lin Yun said. “You don’t have to persuade me.”

“What are your odds of winning?” the Indigothunder Peak Master asked.

Lin Yun put out his palms with five fingers stretched out.

“Fifty percent?” the Indigothunder Peak Master rejoiced because fifty percent was high.

But Lin Yun suddenly put down one finger.

“Forty percent?”

Lin Yun shook his head and put down another finger.

“Thirty percent?!” the Indigothunder Peak Master exclaimed. If Ye Qingtian only had thirty percent odds of winning, it was no different from courting death.

But when Lin Yun put down another finger, the Indigothunder Peak Master finally couldn’t sit still anymore and said, “Twenty percent? We should just go and not get involved in this matter.”

“I’m trying to say that?he?only has a twenty percent chance of winning against me. What are you thinking about?” Lin Yun replied.

The Indigothunder Peak Master was briefly stunned before he glared at Lin Yun, “Ye Qingtian, you can really pretend!”

Lin Yun smiled, “Relax. I’m honestly talking about it. There might be pressure in our fight, but he’ll definitely lose.”

“Why?” the Indigothunder Peak Master asked.

“I have a reason to retrieve the Cauldron Sword no matter what,” Lin Yun said firmly. He continued, “Things are simpler than I thought. I thought the Hidden Sword Manor would get a Saint to be the sword wielder or a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase, at the very least.”

The Indigothunder Peak Master was shocked, and he said, “I think they want to let Feng Shaoyu inherit the Cauldron Sword, but you just happened to appear at the right moment. So they might as well stop pretending, but they probably didn’t expect that you wouldn't give up.”

“A mere Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase wants to make me retreat? The Hidden Sword Manor has underestimated me,” Lin Yun said.

The Indigothunder Peak Master was speechless before he said, “Shouldn’t they be shocked that someone at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage wants to challenge a Quasi-Saint?”

“Should they?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Quit acting and honestly tell me about your odds of winning,” the Indigothunder Peak Master said.

“I’m not acting. He might have a twenty percent chance if I give him face. If I don’t give him any face, he might not even have a ten percent chance of winning,” Lin Yun said.

“You’re still acting!” The Indigothunder Peak Master was furious as he knocked against Lin Yun’s head.

The pain made Lin Yun bitterly smile as he said, “Peak Master, I’m not acting.”

He really wasn’t fooling around. Feng Shaoyu should be at the pinnacle Azure Origin Phase, and it was terrifying. Someone like Feng Shaoyu could inflict heavy injuries on Lin Yun with a strike. Still, Lin Yun wouldn’t allow Feng Shaoyu to touch him.

It was unquestionable that Feng Shaoyu was strong, but Lin Yun’s three trump cards were stronger. Even Lin Yun didn’t know how powerful the two sword stars were, but they had long surpassed the limits of the Nirvana Stage. Most importantly, all three of his trump cards could overlap together.

His Astral Sword Intent and sword stars could empower the Divine Firefly Sword, and Lin Yun couldn’t help trembling just thinking about it. Even he was afraid of how powerful he was. As for Light of the Beginning, it was best that he didn’t have to use it.

“Can’t you learn to be humble?” the Indigothunder Peak Master asked.

Lin Yun bitterly smiled, “I’ve already become humble. I’m now worried about how I should win the battle without killing him.”

If he killed Feng Shaoyu, it would be an issue for him to leave the Hidden Sword Manor and borrow the Cauldron Sword.

“You can’t do that,” the Indigothunder Peak Master said. “Don’t hold back if there’s an opportunity because it’s a life-and-death battle three days from now. He might not go easy on you even if you went easy on him. If someone has to die,?he?should die. The Heavenly Dao Sect isn’t afraid of the Hidden Sword Manor.”

But the Indigothunder Peak Master became speechless and bitterly smiled. Why did he suddenly feel that Ye Qingtian?could?kill Feng Shaoyu? But since Ye Qingtian looked so confident, he must still have some trump cards.

“Alright, I’ll not persuade you further,” the Indigothunder Peak Master said. “Speaking of which, are you acquainted with that peak master from the Sword Sect?”

“My master, the Dragon Origin Great Saint, has some relationship with the Radiant Sword Saint. Why do you ask me?” Lin Yun asked.

“This is something he asked me to give you.” The Indigothunder Peak Master took out a box and said, “That peak master once said that Flower Burial retrieved a Nether Saint Sword from the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Under the nether energy, the Divine Firmament Peak nurtured a Nine-Petal Netherflower.”

Lin Yun rejoiced when he heard that because the Nine-Petal Netherflower was a treasure.

The Indigothunder Peak Master didn’t stay there any longer and left shortly after.

Lil’ Purple came out of the Iris Secret Realm and smiled, “You’re not inferior to my grace. Speaking of which, are you that confident in this fight?”

Lil’ Purple blinked her eyes with curiosity when she asked that question.

“Fifty percent,” Lin Yun said.

“Why did you say that, then?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“He wouldn’t have been relieved if I didn’t say it that way. Peak Master is a good person, and I’m afraid that he’ll forcefully drag me back to the Heavenly Dao Sect if I didn’t say that,” Lin Yun said. As he spoke, he opened the box in his hand.

“A Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase isn’t terrifying, but I have no idea of the Hidden Sword Manor’s means,” Lin Yun said.

“You’re pretty confident in yourself,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun closed the box and asked, “Let me ask you this question. Who do you think is stronger, Feng Shengling or Gu Zijing?”

“Gu Zijing, of course,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun smiled, “If Gu Zijing was at the Quasi-Saint Realm, the odds of winning might be uncertain if we fight. But if Feng Shengling reached the Quasi-Saint Realm, I have at least a fifty percent chance of beating him.

“Feng Shaoyu is older and can only be considered a strengthened version of Feng Shengling, at best. Not to mention I have a reason to fight, no matter what. I have to send the Cauldron Sword back to the Sword Sect!” Lin Yun said.
