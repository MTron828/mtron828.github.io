Chapter 728 - Kill

It was a grand occasion for the three forces to recruit disciples, but it had turned into a stage for the seven geniuses. Everyone knew that the three overlord forces came for the seven geniuses, but no one expected that the seven of them would be so overbearing.

After watching how Guo Xu and Ouyang Hao humiliated Yang Fan, no one dared to take the test anymore. After all, they knew that it was futile even if they got through the test. Who dares to attempt the tests with the seven of them joining forces?

But under this tense atmosphere, Lin Yun actually stood up. Of course, this attracted everyone’s attention. With baffled looks, the crowd watched Lin Yun as he headed for the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s stage. They shook their heads with pity as they recalled Yang Fan’s outcome. In their view, this white-clothed swordsman would end up in an even more terrible state than Yang Fan.

“He’s really courting death since he dares to try…” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I don’t think he can even get through the test. He’ll probably be killed by the statue,” sneered the Skymound City’s geniuses, especially those from the Qin Clan.

Under everyone’s view, Lin Yun soared into the sky with no hesitation. When he soared into the sky, the stone statue came to life and unleashed a roar. But there was no change on Lin Yun’s face beneath the mask as he circulated the Azure Dragon Enneaform. Sixteen dragon runes began to squirm on his body as they unleashed a dragon roar.

The statue flew into the sky, shrouded in the crimson aura as it pushed its palm out at Lin Yun with a ferocious roar. The power contained in the statue was so terrifying that even Qin Xu threw up a mouthful of blood after bearing six palms. Additionally, it had killed a lot of people.

“It’s here!” The disciples of Skymound City lit up at this scene. When they saw that Lin Yun wasn’t moving, they thought that he had been scared silly and they started to mock him.

When the stone statue’s palm was about to reach Lin Yun, Lin Yun finally made his move. Clenching his fist and pouring all sixteen dragon runes into his fist, he threw a powerful punch. Under this punch, cracks spread out on the stone statue and covered its entire body in the blink of an eye. Then, the stone statue broke into pieces under a huge explosion.

“This…” Everyone was dumbfounded by this scene and their jaws dropped. They were too shocked. The swordsman destroyed the stone statue with a single punch?

This scene even drew the attention of the other geniuses. Qing Ruoyou was also surprised by this scene while the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s elders all wore a big smile. They didn’t expect that there was such a genius in Skymound City aside from Chen Ziyu and Chu Muyan. This instantly made them rejoice.

As the cloud of stone fragments flew in the sky, Lin Yun landed on the stage before looking at Qin Xu and Ouyang Hao. This made them swallow their saliva as they could sense themselves being completely suppressed by the swordsman’s gaze.

This left them dumbfounded because they initially wanted to break this swordsman’s leg and make him kneel on the ground. But now, they no longer had the overbearing manner that they had previously. They were currently thinking of interacting with Lin Yun first.

“Brother…” Qin Xu and Ouyang Hao calmed themselves down before squeezing out a smile on their faces.

But Lin Yun clenched his fist with his thumb up before he turned it down, “Trash!”

This provocation was a blatant act of humiliation. This made everyone take in a cold breath as they were dumbfounded by the white-clothed swordsman’s action. They were shocked by the fact that the swordsman dared to humiliate Qin Xu and Ouyang Hao in Skymound City, especially after Qin Xu and Ouyang Hao had cowered and tried to form a good relationship with him.

Qin Xu and Ouyang Hao’s faces became ugly with awkwardness written all over their faces. Qin Xu, who had a fiery temper, became enraged as he pounced over with a transformed right arm, “You dare to provoke us? You don’t know how death is spelled?!”

“ARGHHHH!” But in the next second, Qin Xu released a howl as Lin Yun’s punch shattered Qin Xu’s palm. But Lin Yun’s attack didn’t end there. His azure dragon energy stretched to Qin Xu’s shoulder before it finally stopped. This meant that Qin Xu’s arm had been crippled, which made everyone twitch.

“You bastard, I’ll kill you!” Qin Xu’s face was distorted and his eyes were red from the terrifying killing aura. But an even more ruthless scene appeared. Before Qin Xu could even attack with his left hand, Lin Yun grabbed onto his hand and ripped his entire arm off.

“No!” The Qin Clan’s elders outside the stage grew angry when they saw this scene and their eyes blazed with fire.

How could they accept Qin Xu’s arm getting ripped off? He was one of the seven geniuses, the representative of the Qin Clan’s younger generation, and the Qin Clan’s hope. So they immediately took action against the white-clothed swordsman.

“Get lost!” The person in charge of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion smiled sinisterly and sent everyone back. He was a middle-aged youth who laughed while he admired Lin Yun. He naturally couldn’t let such a genius be affected by the Qin Clan. “This is the recruitment of my Heavenly Demon Clan. Who the hell do you people think you are? Get lost!”

Throwing a palm out, the Qin Clan’s elder who was charging at the front was left half-dead. This left everyone trembling in fear as they didn’t dare to move. But when they looked at Qin Xu’s situation, they couldn’t help gnashing their teeth.

Right at this moment, Ouyang Hao moved as he snorted at Lin Yun. He unleashed a terrifying killing aura as he held onto his spear. This made everyone’s eyes from the Qin Clan light up as they hoped that Ouyang Hao would kill the white-clothed swordsman to save Qin Xu.

Ouyang Hao’s spear moved with a tricky trajectory. He was waiting for the opportunity to attack, like a viper that wanted to claim its victim’s life. He sneered, “It doesn’t matter who you are, die!”

Ouyang Hao’s spear shined so brightly that the entire crowd felt stinging pain on their faces. Even those who were far away felt the pain.

The Skycloud Sect’s disciples and elders wore a smile as they could imagine the scene of the white-clothed swordsman’s chest being pierced. Since the Qin Clan and Qin Xu couldn’t do it, then their Skycloud Sect would protect the face of Skymound City!

But Lin Yun didn’t panic under this situation as he sent Qin Xu flying with a kick. When Qin Xu fell onto the ground, he threw up another mouthful of blood.

Sending Qin Xu flying, he slowly stepped forward and his black hair fluttered in the wind. He seemed to be taking a stroll, but no one knew that he had already accumulated his xiantian sword intent to a terrifying height.

The Flower Burial Sword in his hand began to roar as it could sense Lin Yun’s hatred and rage. As a brilliant sword ray flew and echoed out, the sword ray clashed with Ouyang Hao’s spear. This attack cracked the spear..

The Skycloud Sect’s elders and disciples were dumbfounded. The sinister expression on Ouyang Hao’s face also froze. He quickly tossed the spear in his hand away and started to retreat.

But could he really escape? The Flower Burial Sword in Lin Yun’s hand instantly caught him and sliced him down.

Ouyang Hao released a miserable howl as his entire right arm was chopped off. But that wasn’t all as Lin Yun stabbed his sword out once more. His sword pierced through Ouyang Hao’s chest, destroying the armour Ouyang Hao was wearing. Then, Ouyang Hao crashed into Qin Xu who was trying to get back on his feet.

“Who the hell are you!” Qin Xu gnashed his teeth and looked at the white-clothed swordsman coldly. He didn’t recall offending a swordsman donned in white, nor did he have any impression of him. Ouyang Hao was also baffled.

“You guys can’t even recognize my voice? The two of you are really forgetful. Then again, I should already be dead in your hearts.” Lin Yun raised his head and removed the mask, revealing his face before everyone with the purple mark on his forehead attracting their attention.

This scene left everyone in Falling Aquatic Mountain dumbfounded before a commotion broke out. The white-clothed swordsman was actually Lin Yun. This was the same Lin Yun who was supposedly killed by Chen Ziyu. But the rumors turned out to be false since he was alive and well.

“No! N-n-no! This isn’t real!” Ouyang Hao and Qin Xu’s eyes squinted in fear as they began to tremble.

“Repent in hell!” As Lin Yun’s sword flew, two heads fell onto the ground. Lin Yun’s sword was so fast that they died before anyone could notice.
