Chapter 2341 - Golden Lotuses In A Sea Of Fire

Nine Golden Dao Fruits, Lin Yun gave Xiong Tiannan and Lin Jiangxian two each, so he was still left with five. They could be used to cultivate Sovereign Daos and help someone comprehend a new Sovereign Dao.

Lin Yun briefly pondered then gave up since he wasn’t familiar with the Sovereign Daos besides Sword Dao. Furthermore, Lin Yun had a dream, which was to use Sword Dao to surpass the limit and suppress the nine Eternal Daos.

Then again, this path required Lin Yun to explore and combine all his learnings. This path was destined to be a long journey.

“Let’s use them all and see how far I can reach with Sword Dao.” Lin Yun soon made up his mind and ate a Golden Dao Fruit.

He felt an explosion in his mind with golden radiance shining from his pores. In a split second, he heard a bell ring that resounded and entered his soul. Under the ringing bell, Lin Yun's sword sea began to boil with his Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent transforming as the Golden Dao Fruit turned into flames, blazing within Lin Yun’s body.

Lin Yun entered a profound space with various dao flowers appearing before him. They were all Sovereign Daos. The thirty-six Sovereign Daos appeared before him, along with various figures grasping them, exhibiting the power of their Sovereign Daos.

While all the Sovereign Daos were displayed before Lin Yun, there were also three thousand Greater Daos, and the origin of those Greater Daos also gave off a horrifying aura.

Lin Yun now understood why the Golden Dao Fruits were so precious. They could guide someone to the origin of daos. The deities who grasped them all left their marks behind, and it was confirmed that he could comprehend Sovereign Daos with the Golden Dao Fruit. The three thousand Greater Daos were also profound, and one could become a deity if they reached a high level with them.

Lin Yun felt countless gazes directed at him, which made him feel tremendous pressure. He waved his hand and the Wind and Thunder Daos lit up. When the two dao flowers were lit up, a thunderstorm merged as the two dao flowers combined into one. They fused into a new dao and gave off a radiance that was not inferior to a Sovereign Dao, accompanied by a dragon’s roar. This was the Azure Dragon Dao.

The origin of it manifested into a dragon, as if it was the lord of all Azure Dragons. Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because Greater Daos could combine to form a new path, and the end of it wasn’t any weaker than Sovereign Daos.

“That’s mine,” Lin Yun smiled as he grasped the Greater Dao. The azure dragon gave off a dignified aura, wanting to test Lin Yun. But after a few glances, golden light shone from the dragon’s eyes. The dragon seemed to have smiled as it allowed Lin Yun to take the dao flower.

This action immediately caused an uproar and more gazes fell onto Lin Yun as if they were trying to tell him to pick them.

This made Lin Yun raise his brow because he didn’t see any Sword Dao. Was it because he had already grasped Sword Dao?

The surrounding noise made Lin Yun feel a headache, so he roared, “Garbage, where’s Sword Dao?!”

Lin Yun furiously roared in this space, causing the surrounding region to tremble. In the next moment, the figures on the other daos became enraged.

“You’re courting death!”

“How dare you call us garbage! You’re being disrespectful to a deity!” Everyone who wanted Lin Yun to pick them became furious as those figures began to descend.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This made Lin Yun panic, but he soon calmed down after taking a clearer look. They were all at the same cultivation as him or at least a small stage higher than him.

“What’s there to be furious about? Flower Burial Lin Yun is here; where’s Sword Dao?!” Lin Yun roared.

At the same time, Xiong Tiannan and Lin Jiangxian also entered this space and were briefly shocked before they rejoiced. They recognized that this was the legendary Door of Wonders, and the other side was the end of various daos. But their voices were different because they grasped Sovereign Daos, and they could see with a glance. There weren’t any noises, and they didn’t feel any gazes on them, unlike Lin Yun.

“Where’s Sword Dao?!” Lin Yun roared as he fought the deities in the surroundings. Whenever he defeated a person, a dao flower would become dim and disappear. No one knew how long this lasted before a dao flower appeared. When a sword vibration echoed, all the other dao flowers in the surroundings became dim.

Lin Yun raised his head and looked at the flower. He muttered, “Three thousand Greater Daos, but only the Sword is supreme!”

When countless voices echoed, a swordsman appeared in this region. It looked at Lin Yun and nodded.

“It’s time for a Sword God to appear!” Someone spoke and Lin Yun was sent out of the Door of Wonders with countless golden flames descending like meteorites, gathering towards Lin Yun.

The golden flames enveloped Lin Yun, and the flower representing Sword Dao began to blaze. Under the temperament of the flame, the purple flower gave off a powerful sword aura.

The surrounding space became distorted and Lin Yun’s past appeared from within this distorted space. This phenomenon was so terrifying that it alarmed Lin Jiangxian and Xiong Tiannan with shock in their eyes.

“What’s that?” Xiong Tiannan was dumbfounded as he raised his head to look at the sky. It felt as though there was a Heavenly Path there with a giant sword erected at the far end of the world and a throne beneath it.

The path was filled with corpses from people who tried to walk this path. Even so, countless people didn’t give up. But the throne was empty and covered in dust.

“Sword God’s path?” Xiong Tiannan frowned with a grave expression. He had only seen this phenomenon in ancient books, but it was rumored that a divine path would appear when monstrous geniuses reached the Emperor Realm.

This was also known as the Heavenly God Path, and those who had this phenomenon became a deity without any exception. But Lin Yun was only a Saint Lord when the Heavenly God Path appeared for him.

However, Lin Yun’s Heavenly God Path was weird. It was covered in blood, corpses, and thorns. Xiong Tiannan pondered that Lin Yun probably wanted to walk on a Sword God’s path that solely belonged to him. This was what powerhouses in ancient times did.

Lin Jiangxian’s eyes flashed, and she could feel her blood boiling. This was the legendary Sword God’s path, and the ancestor of their Heavenly Sword Pavilion also saw this phenomenon before.

“A Sword God’s path that’s unique from everyone…” Lin Jiangxian muttered with excitement. This was a path that solely belonged to Lin Yun.

Lin Jiangxian and Xiong Tiannan took a deep breath and closed their eyes to comprehend their own daos.

Lin Yun would refine a Golden Dao Fruit every day for the next few days and the saint dao of his Sword Dao increased. Under the flames and the nourishment of the Golden Dao Fruit, the flower representing Sword Dao was slowly being transformed.

Three days later, the indigo flower became silver. Five days later, the silver flower became golden, a golden lotus, blooming in the sea of fire.

The saint dao of his Sword Dao had reached ninety thousand, and the dao flower ultimately became a golden lotus with nine petals.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he let out a breath as a sea of fire with a golden lotus on it appeared behind him. While Lin Yun was enveloped in the saint radiance, he looked like an actual Sword God.

“Three thousand Greater Daos, but only the Sword is supreme!” Lin Yun muttered as his Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent reached a new height, enveloping him in a sword radiance. At this moment, his saint dao reached the same level as the cultivators from the various realms.

Lin Yun’s mastery of the sword reached the limit of a Saint Lord and was comparable to Saint Sovereigns.
