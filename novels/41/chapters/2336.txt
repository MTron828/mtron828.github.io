Chapter 2337 - Grace

Wang Jue hovered with his hair fluttering, making him look like an invincible immortal. When a powerful aura descended, Qilin Mountain began to tremble.

“Seventh-stage Saint Lord…” Mu Xiuhan’s face became pale with deep fear in his eyes. The last three stages of the Saint Lord were increasingly challenging, but one would transform if one could make it through. A seventh-stage Saint Lord was at least ten times stronger than a sixth-stage Saint Lord. After being tempered by the tribulation, the circulation of saint energy would become different and more powerful.

This was equivalent to the difference between saint aura and saint energy. Mu Xiuhan was at the pinnacle of the sixth-stage Saint Lord, but he didn’t dare to take that step out since someone with more talent would die faster. He had seen many older generations taking the risk and died a terrible death. So he was only filled with envy when he saw Wang Jue’s cultivation.

This was the benefit of divine disciples. With the guidance of a deity, they would have no risk to life even if they failed.

“I see…” Lin Yun finally understood the huge difference in their strength earlier. He began to analyse his trump cards: Nirvana Dao, Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent, Sovereign Constellation, Azure Dragon Sword Domain, Nirvana Sword Art, and the Divine Firefly Sword…

“We’re finished now that we know he’s a seventh-stage Saint Lord…” Xiong Tiannan smiled bitterly. He had already guessed Wang Jue’s cultivation earlier when they made a move.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Jiangxian struggled back to her feet with a pale complexion, but there was no surprise in her eyes.

“I’ll deal with the two of you later!” Wang Jue looked at the two with disdain before his gaze fell on Lin Yun again. He looked prideful, as though Lin Yun’s life was in his hands, and he said, “Give me a reason not to kill you.”

“You still have time to leave now. Otherwise, I’m afraid it won’t look nice for you if we fight later,” Lin Yun smiled. He didn’t place the Azure Divine Guards in his eyes, but a divine disciple might have protection left behind by a deity, so he wasn’t entirely sure that he could kill his opponent. His words caused a commotion in the surroundings because they didn’t expect Lin Yun to have such a strong stance.

“Hey, Brother Lin, leave when you can,” Xiong Tiannan said while lying on the ground.

On the other hand, everyone from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion helped Lin Jiangxian up before looking at Lin Yun with confusion.

“It looks like you still have no idea of a divine disciple’s strength!” Wang Jue smiled as his expression became calm once more. When he appeared before Lin Yun again, he pushed his palm forth and shattered Lin Yun’s aura.

“Holy shit, Lin Yun is finished.”

“The difference in their cultivation is too great.”

Lin Yun was calm as he held onto the Flower Burial Sword and released his Divine Light Sword Intent at complete mastery. The pressure he felt was immediately alleviated as a dragon’s roar echoed from his chest with golden sword radiance shining out. With just one sword, Lin Yun severed Wang Jue’s attack into two.

“Sword Domain!” Wang Jue squinted as he stepped forth, entering Lin Yun’s Sword Domain. When they clashed, Wang Jue wasn’t affected by Lin Yun’s Sword Domain and looked like a wild beast that could tear apart the Sword Domain the next instance.

Ten-odd moves later, Wang Jue knocked the sword away and threw a punch at Lin Yun’s chest. His saint energy pierced through Lin Yun’s sword intent and saint energy, sending Lin Yun flying back.

All the cultivators from the Azure Cloud Realm were also shocked as they looked at Lin Yun and wondered if he could still live.

“No…” Ji Zixi became nervous and furious, wanting to charge at Wang Jue. But she was held down by Lin Jiangxian.

“Divine Light Sword Intent? Azure Dragon Divine Physique? They’re nothing before a divine disciple,” Wang Jue said with disdain as he dashed forth, wanting to end the fight with another punch.

“Who said the battle has ended when I’m still alive?” Lin Yun grinned while being on one knee. His fighting spirit was blazing in his eyes. He knew that he made the right decision in coming to the Heavenly Barren Realm. But he had to thank his wife, Su Ziyao. Without the Azure Saint Cloth, he would probably have to run for his life after taking that punch.

“Mhm?” Wang Jue was surprised. After all, his attack wasn’t something that someone at the fifth-stage Saint Lord could withstand. But Lin Yun didn’t suffer any injuries and was filled with fighting spirit instead.

“Holy shit, he stood up!”

“Even a divine disciple can’t suppress him!”

“He’s a weirdo. This is too unbelievable.”

Everyone in the surrounding area was dumbfounded and could feel their blood boiling after they recovered from their shock. After all, a divine disciple was a deity-like figure to them. But today, someone like that couldn’t even deal with a swordsman.

Wang Jue frowned, and said, “I know that the Golden Dao Fruits you threw out aren’t real. If you admit defeat now and hand over the Golden Dao Fruits, I can spare your life.”

“My sword doesn’t agree with it.” Lin Yun smiled, wielding the Flower Burial Sword and sensing its fighting spirit. “I won’t stop fighting until my blood bleeds out!”

Lin Yun laughed as he charged at Wang Jue under everyone’s shocked gazes. With a roar, Lin Yun performed the Light of the Beginning. When he performed it, Wang Jue was shocked to discover that he couldn’t catch up with Lin Yun and could only see a blurred ray of light.

When they fought again, Lin Yun’s sword technique became unpredictable. Thirty moves later, Wang Jue was sent flying away with a sword vibration. But when he retreated, he pushed his palm forth, sending Lin Yun flying away. As for Wang Jue, he was covered in blood, which was a shocking scene.

“You’re committing blasphemy!” Wang Jue’s gaze became vicious as three dao flowers appeared behind him. They were all Sovereign Daos. They were the Death Dao, Life Dao, and Devour Dao. Not only that, but the saint daos for each Sovereign Dao reached fifty thousand.

This was a shocking scene, and everyone could feel their scalps going numb. Xiong Tiannan and Lin Jiangxian also had fear in their eyes. As for the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples, their legs were wobbling.

“Thirty, no… fifteen minutes! Hold him back for fifteen minutes, and I can defeat him!” Lin Yun took a deep breath before looking at Xiong Tiannan and Lin Jiangxian.

Xiong Tiannan hesitated, but a sword ray flew out while he hesitated. Lin Jiangxian didn’t say a word as she drew her sword, unleashing a sword ray. With a flash, she immediately charged at Wang Jue.

“Holy shit!” Xiong Tiannan was affected by Lin Jiangxian, and smiled, “So what if you’re a divine disciple? I’m someone who would even dig a deity’s tomb!”

When Lin Jiangxian blocked Wang Jue’s attack, she unleashed a sword ray that pierced through the sky, landing on Wang Jue.

“The Heavenly Divine Sword!” Everyone’s faces changed when they saw this sword ray. It was the famous Heavenly Divine Sword of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion.

“Rise!” Xiong Tiannan roared and ten coffins rose from the ground, each with various talismans. When the coffins opened up, ten corpses appeared and were all at the sixth-stage Saint Lords. Most importantly, the ten corpses were all corpse kings.

When the ten corpse kings opened their eyes, they charged at Wang Jue. This was a shocking scene that made everyone’s faces change—that's because Lin Yun, Xiong Tiannan and Lin Jiangxian resorted to their trump cards, not to mention that Lin Jiangxian didn’t even have a hint of hesitation.

Wang Jue frowned and looked impatient. Regardless of the corpse kings or the Heavenly Divine Sword, he couldn’t deal with them anytime soon.

Right then, a golden radiance shone as spiritual energy began to pour into Lin Yun’s body from the surroundings, with a pillar of light enveloping him.

“He’s trying to break into the sixth-stage Saint Lord!” Everyone came to their senses and were surprised. They finally recalled that Lin Yun was at the fifth-stage Saint Lord when he fought with Wang Jue.

“Mhm?” Wang Jue instantly noticed that something wasn’t right. Lin Yun was already strong at the fifth-stage Saint Lord, and there might be trouble when he reaches the sixth-stage Saint lord.

“Ghost Owl, Ray Serpent!” He gave an order and the two remaining Azure Divine Guards lunged at Lin Yun.

“Get past me first!” A figure appeared before them. It was Ji Zixi. She spread her arms apart, ripping her cloak and revealing her crimson robe. Under this robe, she looked dazzling and radiated with peerless beauty. Her gaze was cold when she looked at Ghost Owl and Ray Serpent.

When everyone raised their heads, they were stumped because they didn’t expect Ji Zixi to look so beautiful.
