Chapter 2244 - Dragon Jade Flame Lotus (1)

“The fun is about to begin.” Li Feibai looked down at the valley, brimming with confidence.

Lin Yun also looked at the alley and saw many Saints that weren’t from the holy lands. Many Saint Lords who were running out of their life span had risked their lives to come here, and even Lin Yun would have to think carefully about this battle. There were some hiding in the dark like him, and they couldn’t be underestimated.

It won’t be easy to obtain the Divine Blood Fruit. Even if I obtained it, I have to plan how to leave. Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts with a grave expression.

“Worrying about this and that isn’t the style of a swordsman. Now that I look at it, you’re worse off than those from Skysolute City,” Li Feibai said as he stood up. He continued, “A swordsman should move forward without hesitation and would rather break than bend.”

Lin Yun opened his mouth and wanted to refute those words, but he gave up and let Li Feibai speak what he wanted.

“Am I wrong?” Li Feibai asked, looking at Lin Yun. He smiled, “You think that I’m teaching you how to do things?”

“You’re right,” Lin Yun replied simply.

“Then it’s settled. I’ll help you obtain the Divine Blood Fruit, but you must give me a few leaves. Your cultivation is lacking, so you might die if you go up. It will be a bloodbath when a battle occurs, and even a Saint Lord will become cannon fodder. Only a Saint Lord at the third-stage can ensure their safety,” Li Feibai said.

“Well, I don’t have any reason to refuse you,” Lin Yun smiled, holding onto his chin. He naturally wouldn’t refuse since someone would help him obtain the Divine Blood Fruit.

Li Feibai said, “You just have to trust me. You saved my life and helped me obtain the Myriad Demon Fruit, and this favor is bigger than you can imagine.”

As they spoke, a blue radiance shone in the valley before forming into a pillar of light, soaring to the sky.

“Two-colored radiance!”

“It looks like the quality of this Divine Blood Fruit is high!”

“Judging from this phenomenon, it might have a third radiance. This is at least a five-colored Divine Blood Fruit. When it leaves the God Burial Mountain Range, it will shock the entire Eastern Desolation.”

“Not only the Eastern Desolation, but I’m afraid many old men will come out.”

On the vast plains in the valley, there was an uproar from the surroundings. Everyone was shocked by the radiance coming from the Divine Blood Fruit. While they were discussing amongst themselves, another white beam of light soared into the sky.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Young Master, this Divine Blood Fruit is different.” An old man in the Ming Cult said, turning to Huang Jingyu.

Huang Jingyu was calm as he looked at the radiance, falling into deep thought. A treasure of this level was rare, and this trip would be worth it if they could obtain it, even if they didn’t get the divine flames. He muttered, “It looks like it won’t be easy to obtain this Divine Blood Fruit.”

Even someone as arrogant as him wasn’t confident about obtaining this Divine Blood Fruit. Right then, those from the Myriad Lightning Sect and Heavenly Flame Sect flew out, while the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord and Liu Yunlan headed in Huang Jingyu’s direction.

The Ming Cult was practically the leader amongst the holy lands in the Eastern Desolation now and they had acknowledged the Ming Cult as the leader of their alliance.

“You two must share the same thought as me,” Huang Jingyu smiled as he looked at the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord and Liu Yunlan.

They were only a hundred years old, so they could be considered geniuses who had known each other for a long time. Anyone could tell with a glance that if these two hadn’t come, Huang Jingyu would’ve also taken the initiative to invite them.

“We’ll depend on our abilities and see who can obtain it. Whoever obtains it, our three forces will cooperate to face everyone else's,” Huang Jingyu said.

“Agreed,” the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord smiled.

“Aside from that, whoever obtains the Divine Blood Fruit should compensate the two other parties,” Liu Yunlan said.

Huang Jingyu briefly hesitated, before he smiled, “Sure.”

“Congratulations. With our three forces joining hands together, the Divine Blood Fruit will be ours, and no one can stop us!”

“We’ll kill anyone who dares to stand in our way!” Since they joined forces, their morale was high, frightening those beside them. But many people were sneering in the dark and didn’t take them seriously. There were still many variables.

“Young Master Wushuang, what should we do with those three forces joining hands?” A Saint Elder of the Divine Dao Pavilion frowned and looked at Qu Wushuang with concern.

But Qu Wushuang was calm as he shook his fan, then said, “We will naturally compete, and we don’t have to fear them, either.”

As one of the six holy lands, the Divine Dao Pavilion was famed for their attainment in spiritual runes, and they naturally had their own foundation. But it was a pity that Ji Zixi wasn’t here, or they could have joined forces and have a higher chance.

Qu Wushuang looked around but couldn’t see anyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain. He had no idea where they went, but he felt that they might’ve gone for the divine flame. The Divine Phoenix Mountain was naturally more concerned about the divine flame than the Divine Blood Fruit. After all, they possessed the phoenix bloodline.

When everyone felt uneasy, another beam of light soared into the sky. Shortly after, seven beams had gathered within the Blood Flame Plains with boundless saint aura gushing out from the source of the radiance.

Enveloped by the seven-colored radiance, boundless life force gushed out from the ground, and everyone could sense its power. Everyone benefited greatly just by taking a deep breath, and some Saint Lords who were running out of life span had their skin becoming younger.

“Seven-colored Divine Saint Fruit!”

“This Divine Saint Fruit can extend the life span by seven hundred years!” Everyone went insane with excitement.

Lin Yun was also surprised that there was a seven-coloured Divine Blood Fruit on the mountain.

As the Divine Blood Fruit came out from the ground with an explosion, the radiance enveloped a thousand miles in radius and was visible to everyone. That was a fist-sized fruit with seven leaves, each enveloped with saint runes.

As a powerful radiance shone out, rain poured down, and the rain droplets flickered with faint saint radiance.

When Lin Yun reached out, he could sense a boundless saint aura entering his body. He muttered, “Just this rain alone can improve many people’s cultivation.”

If it was in the past, this rain would have been equivalent to a great fortune, but no one was bothered by it when it compared to the Divine Blood Fruit.

Before Lin Yun could respond, ten-odd figures released a terrifying saint radiance as they charged at the Divine Blood Fruit.

“Stay here. I’ll bring back the Divine Saint Fruit for you.” Li Feibai also made a move and disappeared on the mountain.

The saint aura fluctuating from the valley resembled rumbling thunder in the ears. Under this pressure, even a Saint Lord at the first stage would have struggle walking.

The battle was bloody, and even the chaos on the ninth at the Heavenly Dao Sect wasn’t as unbelievable as this scene. The Saint Lords clashed amongst themselves before they could even get close to the Divine Blood Fruit. This clash was mainly formed from those Saint Lords who didn’t have much life span left, and they fought with their lives on the line.

“Lin Yun, do you think he will be able to obtain the Divine Blood Fruit?” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the Iris Secret Realm.

“He’s at least a member of the Li Clan, one of the Eight Imperial Clans. So he should have some trump cards,” Lin Yun said.

The seven-colored radiance shattered as a Saint Lord grabbed the Divine Blood Fruit. But in the next second, he was torn into pieces by ten-odd martial techniques flying in his direction.

When the Divine Blood Fruit flew out, everyone quickly chased after it. To a holy land, even the death of a Saint Lord could be serious. Many Saint Lords have lost their lives here, but no one gave a damn about it with their eyes gathered on the Divine Blood Fruit.

Under this atmosphere, the Divine Blood Fruit might be snatched away if they didn’t move. So even if they knew that everyone would target them if they took the Divine Blood Fruit, no one could keep their composure.

The battle was too chaotic and even a Saint Lord couldn’t maintain their composure if they ran into a treasure that could extend their life span. Over ten-odd Saint Lords lost their lives in just half an hour, and the casualties were still increasing.

“A bunch of old farts came to join this fun despite knowing they had no chance? They must be courting death,” Huang Jingyu indifferently commented when he saw this scene.

“Young Master, it’s time for us to make a move.”

“Without a transcendent fate, taking it is no different from asking for trouble. No one except for the young master has the fate to accept it.”

“The fate is on our side!” The other Saint Elders by the side spoke out.
