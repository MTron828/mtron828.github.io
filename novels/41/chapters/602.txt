Chapter 603 - Mu Chen’s Concern

The Thunderbolt Slasher was naturally terrifying. After all, Lin Yun had used it to kill someone far above his cultivation when he was in the Yin stage. Now that he was in the lesser Yang stage, his power was unimaginable. After all, his Iris Sword Sutra was in the tenth stage and his xiantian sword intent was at greater mastery.

When the crimson flames crumbled, Leng Haoyu’s face changed drastically and he quickly retreated. But even though he was fast, the silver sword ray still left a huge gash on his chest. If he didn’t have a powerful cultivation, he would have already been killed. In the end, he was still heavily injured by the sword and his face was pale.

“This sword again…” Mo Ling was surprised as she had seen Lin Yun using this attack back in the Five Academies Competition. Lin Yun had used this sword to split his opponent into two and it was just as mighty against Leng Haoyu, a genius on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

“Brother Leng!” Lin Zhiyuan’s face changed as he stepped forward. When he saw Leng Haoyu’s wound, his face darkened and he sucked a deep breath. Not only were Leng Haoyu’s ribs broken by the attack, there were even cracks to his internal organs.

“Let’s go!” Leng Haoyu glared at Lin Yun before he turned around, wanting to leave. Although that sword didn’t take his life, it had still injured him heavily.

“Since you’re already here, then stay!” Lin Yun said coldly as the sword in his hand suddenly exploded into fragments that hovered in front of him. As Lin Yun crossed his arms together, the Iris Sword Sutra began to circulate frantically.

All the xiantian sword intent within his body began to stir up with the sword fragments freezing around him. It looked as though time had stopped around Lin Yun.

This scene left many people baffled. Lin Yun’s sword had already shattered, but he still wasn’t going to let Leng Haoyu off?

While everyone was confused, Lin Yun reached for one of the fragments like he was plucking a petal off a flower. When Lin Yun held onto it, the other fragments exploded into dust.

Pouring all the sword aura he had accumulated into the fragment, Lin Yun flicked it out and it streaked across the sky. In the blink of an eye, the fragment had pierced through Leng Haoyu’s forehead from the back of his skull. Leng Haoyu didn’t even have the time to turn around.

When the baffled Lin Zhiyuan turned to look at Leng Haoyu, the boundless sword aura within Leng Haoyu’s body exploded and ripped his body into pieces. The explosion also sent Lin Zhiyuan flying. Lin Zhiyuan got up with great difficulty and began to run for his life without turning around. All of this occurred in a split second.

“How terrifying. He’s actually able to defeat two geniuses on the ranking when he’s only in the lesser Yang stage.”

“Who is he?”

“That’s Lin Yun. He’s the one who defeated the Northern Snow Manor’s Cao Zhen.”

“This fellow improved too quickly. He only defeated Cao Zhen a month ago, right? But now, he’s actually capable of killing Leng Haoyu!”

With that, the battle had come to an end with one death and one heavy injury. This outcome had exceeded everyone’s expectations as they looked at Lin Yun with shock. Everyone had expected Lin Yun to die, but the tables had turned around before anyone could react.

Right at this moment, a few figures flew over belonging to the Heavenly Province Academy and Heavenly Sword Sect. Zhang Yuan and Liu Yunyan stepped forward to help Mo Ling. Then, Zhang Yuan locked his brows together, “What happened?”

He was late. More accurately speaking, he was attracted by Lin Yun’s sword intent. But when he came, Lin Zhiyuan had already fled.

“I ran into Lin Zhiyuan and Leng Haoyu. They both ganged up on me,” said Mo Ling.

“Those two? Damn it. I should’ve taught them a lesson back in the Flamecloud Mountain Range. I won’t let them off when we enter the empyrean’s tomb!” Zhang Yuan said with killing aura brewing in his eyes.

“I’m afraid that you won’t have the opportunity to,” said Mo Ling with a bitter smile. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Zhang Yuan was baffled, but then Mu Chen whispered in his ear, “Senior brother, Leng Haoyu was killed by Lin Yun and Lin Zhiyuan already ran for his life. I don’t think he has the guts to show up anymore.”

Zhang Yuan was deeply shocked by Mu Chen’s explanation as they watched Lin Yun walking over slowly. If Mu Chen hadn’t witnessed it personally, he also wouldn’t believe what he saw. The difference between him and Lin Yu was simply too great.

“What?!” Zhang Yuan and the rest were shocked by what they heard from Mu Chen and they turned to look at Lin Yun.

It took a long while for Zhang Yuan to recover from his shock. When he recalled how he tried to recruit Lin Yun because he got a slight upper hand in his spar with Leng Haoyu, he couldn’t help feeling embarrassed. At the same time, he now knew why Lin Yun wasn’t tempted by his offer. So it turns out that the likes of Leng Haoyu couldn’t even enter Lin Yun’s eyes.

“Lin Yun, you’ve really given me a shock,” smiled Zhang Yuan awkwardly.

“It’s fine,” replied Lin Yun.

Leng Haoyu and Lin Zhiyuan were both on the ranking, and they had the strength to back it up. If he hadn’t made his breakthrough to the Yang stage, even he would have some difficulty facing Leng Haoyu.

But the two of them were much weaker than Guo Xu and Yang Fan. After he refined the Profound Yin Water and reached the Yang stage, they were no longer placed in his eyes, especially when his xiantian sword intent was in complete mastery.

With his xiantian sword intent in complete mastery, his name would spread throughout the Ancient Southern Domain sooner or later. At that time, he wouldn’t be any lesser than the geniuses on the ranking.

Everyone could tell that Lin Yun was different, but they couldn’t tell what the difference was. Right at this moment, Liu Yunyan exclaimed, “Lin Yun, you seem to have grown taller.”

“It really looks like it.”

“I wouldn’t have noticed if you didn’t mention it.” Everyone was shocked to discover that Lin Yun had grown taller over the past few days and his body became even more perfect.

“You…” Mo Ling seemed to have thought of something, and she looked at Lin Yun with her eyes lit up.

Lin Yun nodded his head to confirm her suspicions. When Mo Ling got her answer, she smiled because it appeared that Lin Yun had obtained the Profound Yin Water.

“Senior sister, how are your injuries?” asked Lin Yun. Mo Ling’s spiritual diagram collapsed when facing Lin Zhiyuan and Leng Haoyu, so the backlash must have been horrible.

“It doesn’t matter. I’ll be fine after a short rest, not to mention that the seal to the empyrean’s tomb is still up,” said Mo Ling as she looked at the starry sky.

“Then you should rest for now. We’ll guard you,” said Zhang Yuan.

“Okay.” With that, everyone surrounded Mo Ling to protect her.

As time passed, more disciples arrived. When more geniuses on the ranking were gathered, the atmosphere also gradually warmed up. Additionally, the shock that everyone received from Lin Yun killing Leng Haoyu had also died off. After all, there were too many geniuses in the Withernorth Sea.

“The Ghost Blade Yan Kong is here.” The appearance of the Ghostflame Sect instantly attracted everyone’s attention. After all, Yan Kong was infamous. Additionally, many people were killed by him in the Withernorth Sea.

“Ji Wuye has also come!” Suddenly, another chilling sensation appeared when Ji Wuye arrived in crimson clothes. He looked around with his eerie gaze, but everyone quickly looked away. No one dared to meet his gaze directly since he was the famous Bloody Butcher.

When Mu Chen saw Ji Wuye, his expression turned pale as he suddenly became uneasy.

“What’s wrong?” Zhang Yuan asked with his brows frowned.

As Mu Chen trembled, he whispered to Zhang Yuan about how Lin Yun killed Ji Wuye’s junior brother to save him.

When Zhang Yuan heard that, his face changed drastically and fear flickered across his pupils, “Lin Yun has done a clean job, so no one should know about it. Just don’t give it away.”

Mu Chen nodded his head, but he still felt uneasy.
