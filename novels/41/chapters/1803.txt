Chapter 1804 - Demonfeather Order

Mei Zihua looked at the departing Lin Yun. He couldn’t figure out why Lin Xiao seemed to be avoiding him. This made him pretty sad because he always felt good about himself, and he had never been disdained by others before.

“This makes no sense. What went wrong?” Mei Zihua held onto his chin with his brows furrowed. “The inheritance in the Black Tortoise Void Sea is just a rumor, and it’s more or less comparable to the Vermilion Bird’s jade slip I gave him. But he’s not interested?”

“Young Master, is there a possibility that Lin Xiao didn’t look at the jade slip at all?” A maid asked.

But Mei Zihua quickly denied it, “That’s impossible. The jade slips are personally recorded by me, so how can he not look at something so precious?”

The maids smiled wryly and were speechless. They were already accustomed to their young master being so narcissistic.

“The Vermilion Bird’s inheritance isn’t as good as the Black Tortoise’s inheritance? This makes no sense. Logically speaking, the Vermilion Bird Saint Canon is stronger than the Black Tortoise Saint Canon. Or does he not want to cooperate with me?” Mei Zihua was still dwelling in his own world.

“Young Master, are we going to the Black Tortoise Void Sea?” The maids asked.

“That place is dangerous. So let’s not do that, not to mention we’ve been out for so long… Wait, I have to go there! That fellow is trying to shake me off, but I won’t let him go so easily!” Mei Zihua said, and the depression on his face was replaced by determination.

Near the port of the Vermilion Bird District was a gorgeous palace. The heir of the Liu Saint Clan, the Wind Edge Lord, looked at the few who came back with the news. There were four people around him. They were the Profound Life Stage elders of the Liu Saint Clan.

Even in powerful sects, Profound Life Stage experts could be considered elders and the pillars of a sect. If saints didn’t appear, the Profound Life and Profound Death Stages were the highest fighting prowess of a sect.

For there to be four Profound Life Stage experts following the Wind Edge Lord was enough to show how powerful a Saint Clan was. Aside from that, there was also a Quasi-Saint behind him, hidden in the shadows.

There wasn’t a single Profound Death Stage because experts with that cultivation couldn’t go to the Black Tortoise Void Sea. If the Wind Edge Lord decided to go, the Quasi-Saint wouldn’t be able to follow him and could only wait outside.

“Liu Hai, that bastard actually ratted me out? How can he possibly live after falling into Lin Xiao’s hands?” The Wind Edge Lord was furious after hearing the news brought back to him. It was fine if Liu Hai died, but he just had to rat him out. This way, the lethality of the rumors would be greatly affected.

As the Wind Edge Lord stood up, he sneered, “But isn’t he a little too bold to challenge me? Are you sure he’s alone?”

The Wind Edge Lord didn’t believe that Lin Yun dared to head to the Black Tortoise Void Sea by himself.

“He’s alone, but Mei Zihua seems to be behind him. But judging from the looks of it, Mei Zihua and Lin Xiao seem to have parted ways in the tavern!” Someone reported.

As ruthlessness flashed across the Wind Edge Lord’s pupils, he briefly pondered before saying, “He dares to be so arrogant? Does he really think that I don’t dare to kill him? If it was not for the Imperial Dragon Order, I would’ve killed him on Thunder Island.”

“That fellow probably really thinks of himself as a disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain to act with such impudence at the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. The Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea doesn’t belong to him!” An elder of the Liu Clan said coldly.

“I thought he was a smart person and would keep a low profile. Since he dares to be so arrogant, is he really not placing the Liu Saint Clan in his eyes?” The Wind Edge Lord smiled.

“Young Master, are we going to the Black Tortoise Void Sea?”

“Of course. Since he wants to play, I’ll play with him, then. Issue the Demonfeather Order and place a bounty on his head. Let me see how he’s going to play with me. Does he really think he’s invincible after being first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking? He’s simply courting death!” The Wind Edge Lord said coldly.

The Black Tortoise Void Sea was a forbidden zone in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. It was massive, and there were many mutated demonic beasts. In the ancient battle between gods, the entire Heavenly Domain was shattered. So even after a hundred thousand years have passed, there were still many forbidden zones in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea with the remnant of the deities’ power.

The Black Tortoise Void Sea was one of them. The higher one’s strength was, the easier it was to detonate the remnant deities' power. Those at the Profound Death Stage would detonate those energies if they entered. If it was detonated, anyone under the Saint Realm would die.

Aside from that, the space in that region was unstable, and it was hard to pass through it. The only way of getting over was through a saint-class warship.

The Black Tortoise Void Sea was famous in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea, and the demonic beasts there were tainted by the deities’ energies. There’s a high chance of saint crystals being born within their bodies.

The saint crystals were useless for those at the Samsara Edict Realm, but they’re effective for saints. So this was why a lot of people would normally head to the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

A saint-class warship heading to the Black Tortoise Void Sea would set off every half month, and the next departure was three days.

Three days later, Lin Yun was standing on the deck of a saint-class warship, reading a scroll of bamboo slips with much information about the Black Tortoise Void Sea recorded on it.

Not far away, Mei Zihua kept a certain distance from him. In the end, this fellow ultimately followed him.

When Lin Yun put down the scroll, he glanced at everyone on the deck. He knew that half of the people here were coming for him.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Three days ago, someone issued the Demonfeather Order and placed a bounty on his head. As long as anyone killed him, they would be able to obtain the Demonfeather Order. Thus, all the demonic cultivators in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea became excited.

The Demonfeather Order was something personally refined by the Demon Emperor himself, and only those with a special friendship with the Demon Gate could obtain one. One could use the Demonfeather Order to exchange for resources, saint elixirs, treasures, and even dragon spirit martial techniques from the Demon Gate. One could even have a chance at a Glory Saint Artifact. As long as it wasn’t a request to become a Saint, the Demonfeather Order could fulfill almost any request.

Lin Yun speculated that the Demonfeather Order was probably obtained by the Wind Edge Lord because it was impossible for anyone else to possess it. Even if they had it, no one would waste something so precious on his life. But his feud with the Wind Edge Lord was at the point where only one person could live.

So it was understandable that the Wind Edge Lord would use it to place a bounty on his head if he had one. But not everyone here was after him. Some were here for saint crystals, and some were here for the Black Tortoise Saint Canon.

As for holy lands’ geniuses like Ji Lingfeng, they had already set off for the Black Tortoise Void Sea half a month ago.

“You don’t seem to be panicking at all.” Mei Zihua said curiously. Anyone would be afraid to have a bounty on their heads because there were many bloody legends about the Demonfeather Order. This was because those with a bounty on their head by the Demonfeather Order were dead.

Lin Yun merely brushed it off with a smile. If he was in the outside world, he might have his concerns. But he didn’t have many concerns about the Black Tortoise Void Sea. On the contrary, it was safer for him in the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

His objective in the Black Tortoise Void Sea was the Black Tortoise Saint Canon and try to make a breakthrough in his cultivation to the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. So he had a reason to go there, and he wouldn’t allow his plans to be disrupted by the Demonfeather Order.

Right then, a group of people appeared on the saint-class warship, and Lin Yun recognized the person leading the party. It was the Wind Edge Lord of the Liu Saint Clan.

The Wind Edge Lord had four Profound Life Stage experts behind him as he calmly walked towards Lin Yun with a smile on his face. But he didn’t care about the uproar in the surroundings, acting as though it had nothing to do with him. His gaze was only on Lin Yun.

The Wind Edge Lord’s appearance naturally caused an uproar on the deck. Everyone knew Lin Xiao and the Wind Edge Lord had a feud, and it practically reached the point that only one of them could live. Their feud started at the West Garden Banquet before proceeding to the Martial Dao Tea Party. After all, the Wind Edge Lord provoked Lin Xiao twice and had his face slapped instead.

With the Wind Edge Lord’s influence within Heavenly Domain City, anyone would’ve been dead a long time ago. In fact, everyone was curious as to why the Wind Edge Lord hadn’t made a move. It wasn’t until rumors began to spread that they realized how vicious the Wind Edge Lord was. As for the Demonfeather Order on Lin Yun’s head, many people suspected it had something to do with the Wind Edge Lord.

But surprisingly, Lin Yun was relatively calm, as if he didn’t see the Wind Edge Lord. Thus, this made the surrounding atmosphere weird and oppressive.

Right then, three people appeared on the deck, and many demonic cultivators had fear in their pupils when they saw the three of them. The leader of those three was a person wearing a white robe, carrying a massive blade on his back.

When everyone saw that blade, they had roughly guessed his identity. This person was Blood Hands Butcher Kou Tianhua, ranked in the top three hundredths on the Demonic Ranking, and there was a bounty on his head in the various holy lands.

Everyone quickly figured out that Kou Tianhua came for the Demonfeather Order, and this meant their chances would be slim. If they made Kou Tianhua unhappy, he might even slaughter them along with Lin Xiao.

The reason why Kou Tianhua dared to challenge the holy lands was that he had a huge background. His master was a powerhouse of the demonic path, the Whitebone Blade Saint. The two people beside him also had a huge background. It was a man and a woman.

The man was called Yuan Hengying, with a pale complexion and a handsome face. His skin was so white that it looked as though there was no blood, but he had a pair of sharp eyes like an eagle. This person was rumored to be a disciple of the Heavenly Flame Sect. He took a saint as his master, but he violated the rules and was expelled from the sect. He followed Kou Tianhua after he was expelled.

The woman looked gentle, and she had the title of Stone Lady, a famous killer in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. She had a fiery figure, and her entire body was wrapped in black cloth, revealing patches of her skin. But anyone who knew her name wasn’t willing to mess with her.

“Lin Xiao is doomed. All of them are experts at the Profound Life Stage!”

“The Demonfeather Order is pretty powerful.”

“The Wind Edge Lord is also here. If I were him, I definitely wouldn't go to the Black Tortoise Void Sea.” The saint-class warship could house thousands of people on the deck, and it was filled with people. Kou Tianhua, who wore a white robe, quickly walked towards Lin Xiao without concealing the murderous intent in his pupils.

“Champion of the Nirvana Banquet, Lin Xiao?” Kou Tianhua asked.

“That’s me.” Lin Yun put down the bamboo scroll and calmly looked at Kou Tianhua.

“It looks like you don’t know what the Demonfeather Order means. We have no feud between us, but I’ll be taking your head.” Kou Tianhua said, and he swept his gaze out on the deck. The warning in his gaze was evident.

“Get lost.” Lin Yun said.

Kou Tianhua was briefly stunned before his gaze turned colder. This fellow was prey to him, so he never imagined that Lin Xiao would be so arrogant.

“I hope you can maintain your arrogance after we arrive at the Black Tortoise Void Sea!” Since it was forbidden to fight on the warship, Kou Tianhua ultimately endured it and left with his two companions.

“Lin Xiao, you seem to be facing some trouble. Do you need help?” The Wind Edge Lord looked over and wore a playful expression. Anyone could tell that the Wind Edge Lord was just shedding crocodile tears.

But Lin Yun merely gave the Wind Edge Lord a glance before he turned his gaze back to the scroll. This naturally made the Wind Edge Lord furious, since he was being ignored.

“Young Master, have some patience. We’ll deal with him after we arrive at the Black Tortoise Void Sea.” The profound life stage elder said.

An hour later, the saint-class warship finally flew away from the Vermilion Bird District’s port, heading towards the Black Tortoise Void Sea.
