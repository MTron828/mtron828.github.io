Chapter 2066 - Is It Enough?

Lin Yun’s words caused a huge wave in the surrounding area as everyone looked at him with disbelief, and their eyeballs nearly fell out. After all, that was a Sovereign Saint Sword that they were talking about. Furthermore, it wasn’t an ordinary Sovereign Saint Sword but one that could be considered a divine artifact after combining with Firmament.

Since the Golden Era, the method for forging Sovereign Saint Artifacts had been long lost, and each sword was an absolute treasure. The champion of the Sword Assembly was indeed qualified to borrow swords, and the Hidden Sword Manor was also willing to lend their swords.

Initially, it was only a form of sentimentality because the Hidden Sword Manor’s ancestors felt that a peerless sword must be matched with a peerless swordsman, or it would be an insult to the sword. But if no one could receive the acknowledgment of the sword, they would rather seal it than recklessly lend it away.

But the Hidden Sword Manor soon noticed this was a pretty good deal. After all, those who could borrowed the swords were monsters amongst geniuses, and those geniuses would owe the Hidden Sword Manor a favor when they grew up. As long as the Hidden Sword Manor wielded the techniques to forge swords, they would maintain their position as the Sword Alliance’s leader.

To a swordsman, who wouldn’t want to obtain a famous sword of their own? So this was a win-win situation.

But Cauldron and Firmament were two different stories. The two swords were too legendary and had a significant meaning to the Hidden Sword Manor. Firmament had been lent out because they had no choice. The borrower’s origin was so great that they couldn’t afford to offend them.

Taking a step back, they would naturally be more willing to lend the sword to those from the Sword Alliance rather than an outsider.

Gu Zijing and the others in the palace were speechless as they looked at Ye Qingtian. In the end, Feng Shengling said with his face flushed, “Isn’t he too much? Not only did he seize the champion, he even has the cheek to ask to borrow Cauldron.”

He was young, and he felt that Ye Qingtian was bullying them by forcing them to oblige to the rules they came up with. As for the seniors of the Hidden Sword Manor, they looked calm and composed. They were talking about Cauldron, and the Hidden Sword Manor had plenty of ways to not lend it away if they didn’t want to.

“Don’t tell me that fellow still has trump cards?” Jiang Yunting looked at Gu Zijing.

Since Ye Qingtian dared to ask to borrow it, this meant he came prepared. Otherwise, he couldn't borrow that sword with the strength he revealed so far. This was under the condition that the Hidden Sword Manor was reasonable to him. But if they weren’t going to be reasonable, there was nothing he could do about it.

Gu Zijing briefly pondered, before saying, “His strength is deep and unfathomable.”

“Oh?” Jiang Yunting was surprised by Gu Zijing's words. Even Zhao Wuji looked over, but he didn’t seem too convinced.

Feng Shaoyu mocked, “You want to borrow Cauldron? On what basis?”

“I know the rules. I must go through the array if I want to borrow the sword,” Lin Yun replied. “I’m only borrowing it temporarily, and I will return it in the future along with a favor of mine.”

Feng Shaoyu replied, “How are you going to pay it back? Based on your talent? I can tell you that the swords borrowed from the Hidden Sword Manor aren’t required to be returned. But tell me, why should I?”

What Feng Shaoyu said was the truth because no one would return the sword they borrowed from the Hidden Sword Manor, and the Hidden Sword Manor also wouldn’t ask for it back. Only under the circumstances of the wielder committing a grave crime would the Hidden Sword Manor summon the Sword Alliance to retrieve the sword.

The atmosphere in the observation area began tense up as everyone whispered amongst each other.

“Young Manor Master, you don’t have to be hostile against me. I came here to borrow it for something important,” Lin Yun suppressed his emotions and politely said, “So please give me a chance to borrow it.”

“Why should I give you a chance?” Feng Shaoyu said with contempt. He didn’t like Ye Qingtian in the first place and even hated him. If it weren’t for the rules of the Sword Alliance, he wouldn’t even give Ye Qingtian the Heavenly Dipper Sword. But since they had fallen out, he did not need to keep pretending any longer.

“Please give me a chance. It doesn’t matter if I’m successful. As long as the Hidden Sword Manor can give me this opportunity, I can promise to do three things for the Hidden Sword Manor in the future,” Lin Yun said seriously.

Tian Xuanzi already took Firmament, so he must retrieve Cauldron for his master. He already promised the two mistresses that he would return with the sword. So he would put up with anything, even if he was being treated coldly because this was nothing compared to his master’s life.

“Who needs your favor? Are you looking down on my Hidden Sword Manor? Do you think the Hidden Sword Manor needs your favor? Ye Qingtian, didn’t you hear what I said? Why should I give you a chance? Tell me why?” Feng Shaoyu said with disdain. The more Ye Qingtian tried to beg him, the more he would want to make things difficult for Ye Qingtian. Wasn’t Ye Qingtian cocky earlier? He wouldn’t give Ye Qingtian the opportunity even if he went down on his knees.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun said, “I have no intentions of being disrespectful.”

“Let me repeat my question. Why! Should! I!” Feng Shaoyu said in an aggressive tone. He kept repeating it no matter what Ye Qingtian said.

“This bastard is too much!” In the observation area, An Ziyun was furious because Feng Shaoyu was too cocky.

Ye Ziling frowned when she looked at Ye Qingtian. For some reason, she felt heartache when she looked at him.

Zhao Yan knew Ye Qingtian’s identity and clenched his fist when he saw this scene.

Lin Yun was silent as he suppressed the accumulated anger within his heart.

Seeing this, Feng Shaoyu sneered, “Ye Qingtian, you just have to tell me why I should. Why should I give you a chance?”

He was merciless with his words and didn’t directly look at Ye Qingtian, no matter how lowly Ye Qingtian made himself out to be.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When Zhao Wuji saw this scene, he felt satisfied as he gloated, “He thinks he’s invincible just because he’s the champion? He deserves this!”

On the contrary, Gu Zijing and Jiang Yunting frowned because they both felt that Feng Shaoyu was too much. Even if he wasn’t willing to lend the sword, he didn’t have to humiliate Ye Qingtian in this manner. Not to mention Ye Qingtian was already very polite with his words.

Just when everyone fell into silence, a roar echoed that broke the silence. Lin Yun became furious as he drew the Heavenly Dipper Sword, “Is this enough?!”

The Heavenly Dipper Sword released a dazzling sword ray when he drew it out, unleashing a powerful sword aura into the surroundings. This scene made everyone exclaim at the sword for truly being worthy of calling Heavenly Dipper a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact.

But everyone became horrified and wondered if Ye Qingtian wanted to make a move against Feng Shaoyu.

On the contrary, Feng Shaoyu sneered when he saw this scene. But before he could finish, Ye Qingtian clamped onto the sword tip and exerted a slight force.

A cry came from the Heavenly Dipper Sword as the sword became dim and began to shatter into pieces before everyone. This instantly left everyone dumbfounded because the Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact in their eyes had shattered into pieces in just a moment and the fragments fell into the lake, causing a huge water geyser to rise to the sky.

The surroundings fell into a dead silence, with everyone being dumbfounded. They were so shocked that they couldn’t say anything because they couldn’t believe that Ye Qingtian had just snapped a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact. After all, it was a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact they were talking about, one that required a hundred years to forge.

“It… broke…” The faces of the seniors and juniors from the Hidden Sword Manor became black when they saw this scene.

“How the hell is this possible?!” Zhao Wuji was so dumbfounded that he cursed.

Gu Zijing also widens his mouth in disbelief. He couldn’t tell how Ye Qingtian snapped the sword. When he turned to look at Jiang Yunting, the latter also shook his head in disbelief.

Feng Shengling’s face became pale because this sword was personally forged by his grandfather, spending a hundred years forging it. But it was snapped by someone at the Nirvana Stage? Not only was this a resounding slap to his grandfather’s face, but the Hidden Sword Manor’s reputation as well.

“Holy shit, what the hell is going on?”

“The Heavenly Dipper broke? Why did the sword break out for no reason? That’s a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact we’re talking about!”

“This is too abnormal!” An uproar burst out from the observation area after a brief silence.

Yun Feng was also dumbfounded as he exclaimed.

Feng Shaoyu was stumped as he stared at the sword hilt in a daze.

Lin Yun coldly looked at Feng Shaoyu and said, “The sword forged by your grandfather is garbage, and the same goes for the swords forged by the Hidden Sword Manor. You ask me why you should. Is this enough? I’m not targeted at you, but your grandfather and the entire Hidden Sword Manor. I wanted to borrow the Sovereign Saint Sword because the swords forged by your Hidden Sword Manor are unworthy to be in my hands! This is my reason. Is this enough?!”

Lin Yun’s words were like a resounding slap on Feng Shaoyu’s face, causing Feng Shaoyu’s face to become pale with anger boiling in his chest. However cocky he was earlier, that was how pathetic he looked.

Looking at the panicking Feng Shaoyu, Lin Yun roared, “Do you think I don’t have a temper just because I’m being polite? So? Is this enough as a satisfying reason?”
