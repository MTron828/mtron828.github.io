Chapter 1274 - Sword Emperor’s Dignity

As eight lights streaked across the horizon, Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan, who weren’t far from the summit, had their faces change. They could sense that they were being enveloped by a terrifying aura.

But this aura didn’t last long. It disappeared when Lin Yun stood up.

“They finally noticed me?” Lin Yun muttered to himself. He could sense that someone had paid attention to him through his divine firmament sword intent.

He could sense that the owners of those gazes were powerful, and there was a high possibility that they were Dragon Pulse Realm experts. They were true experts because the strongest in appearance of many big sects were only Dragon Pulse Realm experts.

As for Samsara Edict Realm experts, they would generally hide in the dark, protecting their transcendent geniuses. But Lin Yun wasn’t afraid that Dragon Pulse Realm experts had paid attention to him. After all, he also had a senior brother who was in the Samsara Edict Realm.

So Lin Yun merely smiled and wasn’t too bothered by them. If Feng Jue wasn’t hiding in the dark to protect him, Lin Yun also wouldn’t have taken it so far and been so fearless. Many times, there were times when he had to stand out. Take this incident, for example. If he didn’t stand out, then he could only watch as the big sects monopolized the quasi-saint elixirs while using other geniuses as nourishment for the Dragon Blood Fruit.

“Lin Yun, be careful.” Zhao Yan suddenly warned.

Lin Yun turned around and his vision was enveloped in crimson light. When he focused his attention, he saw a crimson blood dragon soaring from the blood pool and flew into the sky. The crimson dragon was emitting a terrifying blood mist, flickering with crimson light that dyed the entire sky red.

As the crimson blood dragon let out a ferocious roar, it turned to look at Lin Yun with flames blazing in its pupils before charging over. When it dove down, it left behind explosive lightning in its path.

But Lin Yun didn’t have any change on his face. He brought out his sword intent while stepping back. When the two auras collided and created a rumbling explosion, a terrifying aura swept out and everyone began to feel like they were suffocating under the immense pressure.

As blood dripped down from the corner of Lin Yun’s lips, he took two steps back after landing on the ground. But the crimson blood dragon released another furious roar before it charged towards Lin Yun.

“You’re courting death!” Lin Yun coldly said while igniting the saint rune within the Azure Dragon Mark. As his sword intent and azure dragon aura combined, Lin Yun also activated the Golden Crow Saint Seal, unfolding a pair of wings behind him. When the golden light shone brightly, each feather on the pair of wings flickered with a metallic luster.

At the same time, his azure dragon sword aura manifested into a realistic huge dragon that was flickering with a purple and golden luster. Its claws were enveloped in thunderstorms and its pupils were blazing with undying sword flames. While being enveloped in a violent aura, the azure dragon made the crimson blood dragon look tiny in comparison.

“Die!” Lin Yun’s hand formed into a claw and indifferently bolted forth. His five fingers were like a sharp sword and each of his fingers were flickering with a dazzling sword ray. When he grabbed onto the crimson blood dragon’s neck, there were terrifying holes being left on the dragon with blood dripping down.

When the blood dripped onto the ground, it immediately turned into golden saint liquid with bizarre flowers and herbs growing from it. As the crimson blood dragon struggled and released a ferocious roar, blood splashed over, making the surroundings look like a celestial realm, filled with a saint mist.

“ARGGGHHH!” The crimson blood dragon ultimately managed to struggle free from Lin Yun’s claws. But its aura had also declined. It turned into a bolt of lightning before soaring towards the heavens. As long as it broke through the first layer, it would be impossible for anyone to find it anymore.

But Lin Yun didn’t bother about the crimson blood dragon and let out a breath before stowing the pair of wings into his body. He merely looked at the crimson blood dragon with his eyes flickering and that was it.

“It actually managed to escape…” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Lin Yun, are you injured?” Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan immediately rushed over after they recovered from their shock. Both of them had pity on their faces. That saint elixir was too terrifying and nearly devoured Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was already strong, but it was a pity that the Dragon Blood Fruit managed to escape. But that didn’t mean that there wasn’t any harvest. Although the Dragon Blood Fruit had fled, the herbs around them were also valuable. There were even some that emitted a faint saint light and some of them might even be quasi-saint elixirs.

Zhao Yan was concerned about Lin Yun’s injuries, so he didn’t chase after the crimson blood dragon. He knew that, although the battle didn’t seem shocking, it was terrifying and he would be heavily injured if he wasn’t careful.

“It’s cunning and it hasn’t fled,” said Lin Yun. The Dragon Blood Fruit had long reached the level of a saint elixir and had been hiding in the blood pool, wanting to grind down Lin Yun’s patience.

Since it was a plant, there was naturally no way Lin Yun could win in terms of patience. After all, any saint elixir could live for tens of thousands of years. So their patience was naturally a lot higher than cultivators.

So Lin Yun purposely revealed a weakness by breaking his gaze from it when the big sects’ Dragon Pulse Realm experts gazed at him. He just never expected that the Dragon Blood Fruit would be a lot more cunning than he had imagined.

“Is it a fake?” Both Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan were dumbfounded. They couldn’t believe that the Dragon Blood Fruit that fled was fake. After all, it was bleeding with saint liquid. If it was a fake, then how terrifying would the real one be?

“Still trying to fake death?” Lin Yun didn’t answer to Gongsun Yan and Zhao Yan. As the sword box on his back bounced open, the Flower Burial Sword flew into his hand.

When Lin Yun grabbed onto the sword, a sword buzz roared from within his body, along with boundless killing intent that poured towards the blood pool through the center of his brows.

Right at that moment, nine demonic vines also broke out from the blood pool. Each of the vines were covered with crimson spikes that charged towards Lin Yun like vipers. This scene made both Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan’s faces change and they quickly stepped back. When they were in mid-air, they both waved their hands together and sword rays containing sky sword intent flew out, landing on the demonic vines.

When they collided, sparks flew around but the demonic vines showed no signs of any damage. But when the demonic vines lashed out in pain, both Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan threw out a mouthful of blood before they were sent flying back and rolling down the cliff.

Looking at this scene, a cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s pupils. It was a mere saint elixir, and it had started to annoy him. As annoyance appeared on his face, Lin Yun drew his sword with a sword ray lighting up the entire sky.

This sword ray instantly destroyed all the demonic vines in its path, turning the vines into ashes. As the blood pool rumbled, a saint elixir enveloped in a black demonic aura containing torrential pressure shot out from the blood pool, wanting to escape.

“Divine Azure Annihilation!” As the sword ocean within Lin Yun’s forehead rumbled, an azure dragon flew out from his sword ocean with boundless pressure. When the azure dragon flew from his forehead, a violent sword aura swept out, enveloping the world in an annihilating pressure.

When the pressure appeared, the heavens and earth were instantly restricted and the Dragon Blood Fruit enveloped in a demonic aura could only be suppressed. But that wasn’t all. The golden human within Lin Yun’s sword ocean radiated brightly with golden light as a boundless sword intent empowered the azure dragon.

This immediately controlled the azure dragon sword ray that was about to rampage and turned it into a dazzling sword ray that enveloped the Dragon Blood Fruit.

The Dragon Blood Fruit immediately ignited with a miserable howl as the demonic traits of the Dragon Blood Fruit were being purified. It didn’t take long for the Dragon Blood Fruit to change from a black demonic fruit to a crystalized fruit that emitted a celestial aura.

The seven leaves on the saint fruit were enveloped in golden runes that emitted a primitive and ancient aura. With a single thought, Lin Yun withdrew the Divine Azure Annihilation. If he continued even further, this entire space would be ripped apart. After all, the divine firmament sword intent had unimaginable destructive prowess.

Truth be told, Lin Yun had ways of dealing with the saint elixir. He didn’t have to use the divine firmament sword intent. But since the Dragon Pulse Realm experts were paying attention to him, he didn’t want to waste too much time. He wanted to end this battle quickly. That was why he used the Divine Azure Annihilation to erase the demonic traits within the Dragon Blood Fruit.

“Holy shit, what was that?!” Gongsun Yan and Zhao Yan both got back on their feet and were dazzled by the golden light coming from the saint elixir. When they slowly got used to the dazzling light, they were both shocked to discover that the surroundings were enveloped in a celestial aura.

“That’s the saint elixir?” Gongsun Yan looked at the Dragon Blood Fruit with his eyes blazing and uncontrollably gulped down a mouthful of saliva. The Dragon Blood Fruit was simply too gorgeous and flawless.

When Lin Yun grabbed ahold of the Dragon Blood Fruit, flames began to blaze in his pupils and he could sense his heart beating violently. His Azure Dragon Saint Art nearly went out of his control, causing his blood to surge violently with a primitive hunger tempting him every single moment.

This made Lin Yun inwardly let out a sigh. He had never seen the Azure Dragon Saint Art being so agitated before, this was even stronger than when it devoured the origin saint rune in the past. But fortunately, Lin Yun could control himself, not to mention that this wasn’t the first time he had encountered this situation.

Lin Yun plucked three leaves and gave them to Zhao Yan. Each leaf was enveloped in golden runes, and those runes contained unimaginable power. The three leaves might seem light, but each one weighed five thousand kilograms.

This made Zhao Yan briefly stunned, but he ultimately nodded his head and accepted the three leaves from Lin Yun. He wasn’t good with words, but he also wasn’t hypocritical. He would only remember this favor from Lin Yun in his heart for the rest of his life.

On the other hand, Gongsun Yan gulped down several mouthfuls of saliva with his gaze glued to this scene. But he was too embarrassed to open his mouth. After all, he had boasted earlier that he was a man with the Sword Emperor’s dignity, and he wouldn’t want it even if Lin Yun gave it to him. So how could he possibly lower himself and ask for it now?

“Erm…Lin Yun…do your words still apply?” Gongsun Yan asked with his face blushed.

“Erm? What are you talking about?” Zhao Yan looked at Gongsun Yan in confusion.

This only made Gongsun Yan even more awkward as he inwardly cursed at Zhao Yan as he spoke in embarrassment, “Erm…erm…Lin Yun, you know what I mean.”

Lin Yun merely smiled at this scene and had no intention of making it difficult for Gongsun Yan. After all, he was in a good mood now. So he simply plucked the leaves and handed them to Gongsun Yan.

“Hehe. Hehe.” Gongsun Yan chuckled, grabbing the leaves within his palm.

Right at that moment, Lin Yun glanced at him and smiled. “If I remember correctly, didn’t you say that you’re someone with the Sword Emperor’s dignity, and that you would never take anything from me, even if you died in the hands of big sects and never get a saint elixir in your lifetime?”

Lin Yun clearly remembered what Gongsun Yan said. But this only made Gongsun Yan’s face turn red as he stuttered, “I…I…”

Seeing that he couldn’t refute those words, he ultimately gave up and yelled, “So what? That was back then. I…I believe the Sword Emperor will forgive me. My heart as a swordsman is undeniable!”

“Hahaha!” Both Zhao Yan and Lin Yun laughed when they heard that. If the Sword Emperor knew about this, the Sword Emperor would probably throw out a mouthful of blood.
