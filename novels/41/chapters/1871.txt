Chapter 1872 - Scumbag

“I can sense it!” Lin Yun rejoiced as he sensed the location of the Iris Sword Box through the Iris Saint Seal, which meant that Lil’ Purple had come out of the Myriad Demon Peak. The Myriad Demon Peak was mysterious and forbidden; even Emperor Realm experts wouldn’t be willing to enter it. So Lin Yun had been worried about Lil’ Purple’s safety, but she looked fine.

This naturally made Lin Yun feel relieved, so he just had to wait now. Thus, he sat on the ground and cultivated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. He had been stuck in the sixth stage for a long time because this cultivation technique required a lot of True Dragon Saint Liquid, but he had no solution to this problem. After leaving the Ancient Barren Battlefield, he had all sorts of harvest except True Dragon Saint Liquid.

A moment later, a heavenly dragon and divine phoenix flew from his body, with the surrounding spiritual energy rushing over. As he sat on the ground, an iris flower that looked like a lotus bloomed beneath him. He was basked in sword rays as the heavenly dragon and divine phoenix coiled around him, with golden light shining on his brows.

A long time later, his Sword Heart sensed a hint of danger, and he opened his eyes to look in a direction. Looking at the empty space, Lin Yun smiled, “It has been a year since we last met, and you’re ruthless. You’re not afraid that you’ll kill me?”

“Hmph, you’re a scumbag.” Lil’ Purple coldly said while standing on the Iris Sword Box.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes to look at Lil’ Purple. She was wearing a purple short dress with her silver hair draped on her shoulders. She had purple seals within the depths of her pupils, with gold and crimson runes on her forehead. Her aura became nobler than before, and she was giving off a faint saint aura. She had undergone a drastic transformation that was incomparable to what she was before, but she still looked like a little girl.

Beside the sword box, Lil’ Red merely grinned, but it didn’t dare to come forth to greet him.

When Lil’ Purple’s attack missed, she charged over to Lin Yun again, fuming in rage. She was fast, then appeared before Lin Yun in the next second.

This naturally surprised Lin Yun because Lil’ Purple had become a lot stronger than before in just one year. Her cultivation had also jumped to the Samsara Edict Realm. Then again, Lil’ Purple’s strength couldn’t be gauged by her cultivation, and Lin Yun decided to take Lil’ Purple’s palm head-on after a brief pondering.

Lin Yun could feel powerful lightning energy when their palms came in contact, before being sent flying away. This naturally surprised him because he could sense an ancient, powerful wind within the lightning.

“You’re alright now!” Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up.

Lin Yun was stunned before figuring out what she was talking about. When they parted, his dragon pulses were heavily damaged. His injuries had recovered six months ago, but he had already forgotten about it. But it seems like Lil’ Purple hadn’t forgotten about it.

“I’m fine now.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hehe, that’s good.” Lil’ Purple smiled before she charged forth once more. Knowing Lin Yun had recovered from his injuries, she no longer held back in her attacks. She was instantly enveloped in a powerful gale and lightning, which differed from Thunderstorm Intent. It was far more ancient than that, and it even had a hint of saint aura.

Whenever Lil’ Purple attacked, her attacks would be accompanied by a howling wind and roaring lightning, and Lin Yun was actually suppressed by her without using his sword. Ten exchanges later, Lil’ Purple found a flaw within Lin Yun’s defense and sent her palm forth. Behind Lil’ Purple, the powerful gale and lightning formed several terrifying dragons.

“I’m sorry.” Lin Yun apologized.

Seeing the sincerity in Lin Yun's apology, Lil’ Purple ultimately went easy on him, and her palm stopped three inches away from his chest. Glaring at Lin Yun, Lil’ Purple replied, “Hmph. You scumbag, do you know how long I have been waiting for you?

“Four whole months!” Lil’ Purple raised her head. She pouted, “Four months and three days. I’m telling you that I’m very unhappy right now.”

“But I’m happy to see you.” Lin Yun smiled.

“As if. You would rather have me die on Myriad Demon Peak… We agreed on six months, and yet you’re nowhere to be seen.” Lil’ Purple turned her head away.

“You have been waiting here all this time?” Lin Yun asked in a guilty tone.

“I didn’t dare to go anywhere with the Iris Sword Box and waited here.” Lil’ Purple nodded.

“I’m sorry about that.” Lin Yun caressed Lil’ Purple’s head.

“It’s still alright.” Lil’ Purple’s gaze became gentle. “I have Lil’ Red to accompany me, so it’s not that boring. I have a lot of harvest from Myriad Demon Peak, too!”

“Oh?” Lin Yun asked with curiosity flashing within his pupils.

“I found another one of the Seven Sovereign Divine Runes.” Lil’ Purple proudly said.

Lin Yun nearly forgot about them because the Iris Sword Box resembled a holy land. Back then, there were seven Sovereign Divine Runes, and he had to gather all of them to restore the secret realm within the sword box.

“I’m guessing that it’s the Extreme Wind Divine Rune.” Lin Yun said.

“At least you’re not stupid.”

“Let’s go in and take a look.” Lin Yun circulated his dragon origin and executed an ancient seal, the Sky Unlocking Seal. With a wave of his hand, Lin Yun entered the Iris Secret Realm with Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red. When his vision recovered, a barren world of darkness appeared before him. The ground was bare, and this place was rid of all life. The sky was dark, with lightning flickering across the sky.

“The Iris Secret Realm.” Lin Yun sighed and walked over to the Phoenix Tree because he finally saw life in this secret realm. There were only a few tree branches back then, and Lil’ Purple was unhappy with her den. It took him a long effort to comfort her, so he couldn’t help smiling upon thinking about it.

“Hmph, what are you laughing at?” Lil’ Purple glared at Lin Yun.

“Nothing much.” Lin Yun examined the sapling. It had grown to a meter in height.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Mhm? You seem to have grown taller.” Lin Yun exclaimed as he turned to look at Lil’ Purple.

“Can’t I grow taller?!” Lil’ Purple glared at Lin Yun before approaching the sapling and muttered, “When this tree is over a hundred meters, I will be able to regain my true appearance.”

“I bet you must have been breathtaking back then.” Lin Yun said.

“That’s for sure. After all, I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!” Lil’ Purple said proudly. “If I regain my true form, I’ll be even more beautiful than Su Ziyao!”

“Why compare yourself with Su Ziyao?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

Lil’ Purple snorted, but she didn’t say a word.

“How long will it take for it to grow to a hundred meters?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“A hundred years? Or maybe a thousand?” Lil’ Purple muttered as her gaze dimmed down.

“Empress, what else did you get from Myriad Demon Peak?” Lin Yun asked.

“I regained a portion of my memories. Myriad Demon Peak was implicated in the Battle of the Gods back then, and I might be from outside the Kunlun Realm.” Lil’ Purple said, recollecting her thoughts.

“From outside the Kunlun Realm?” Lin Yun asked.

“I’m not sure.” Lil’ Purple shook her head. “Back then, many people received the grace of that lord and many people came from outside the Kunlun Realm to help. But that lord didn’t appear even when the battle came to an end…”

Lin Yun knew she was talking about the Blue Dragon Ancestral God. He said, “Perhaps he’s already dead.”

“Maybe. But I must find out what happened back then and how the Nine Emperors rose to power. They might be related.” Lil’ Purple sighed.

Lin Yun was surprised to hear what she said.

“Oh, right. Lin Yun, how did you spend your past year? Tell me about it…” Lil’ Purple asked curiously.

Lin Yun smiled and shared with her what he experienced in the past year.

Lil’ Purple was naturally captivated by his story. When she heard that he had met up with Yue Weiwei, she had joy on her face. When she heard about the Nirvana Banquet, she pouted, “You saw so many people on the Three-Lives Lake, so why didn’t you see me?”

“What are you thinking about?” Lin Yun bitterly smiled.

“Speak. Did you see me?” Lil’ Purple pursued.

Lin Yun naturally didn’t see her, and he told her frankly.

After hearing what Lin Yun said, Lil’ Purple’s eyes became red, and she puffed her cheeks, “You heartless scumbag!”

“I’m just joking. I naturally saw you.” Lin Yun said helplessly.

Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up, and she asked, “Are you telling the truth? You’re not allowed to lie to me!”

“I’m serious about it.” Lin Yun said sincerely.

“You scumbag!” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun with disgust, naturally making Lin Yun smile bitterly.
