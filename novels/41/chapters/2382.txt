Chapter 2383 - Heaven's Gate

The divine physique was Profound Sky Venerable’s trump card when he was young. But when he saw the disdain in Lin Yun’s eyes and fighting spirit, Profound Sky Venerable decided to teach Lin Yun a lesson. He said, “Come on, Flower Burial. Let me see your strength.”

Ten thousand combinations? Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to make his move and briefly pondered before he found a way to deal with it. He took a deep breath, and disappeared, “I apologize in advance.”

When he reappeared, he was less than half a meter from Profound Sky Venerable as thunderstorms roared with a dragon’s roar echoing. When he activated his physique, Lin Yun's body began to swell, and a golden azure dragon appeared on the surface of his body, before throwing a punch at Profound Sky Venerable.

Profound Sky Venerable’s eyes lit up as the flaw Lin Yun found was purposely revealed by him. Just when Profound Sky Venerable was about to smile, Lin Yun turned and left behind over ninety afterimages, throwing a barrage of punches at Profound Sky Venerable.

Profound Sky Venerable’s Heavenly Metal Armor showed signs of collapsing, which shocked him greatly.

Lin Yun didn’t care about weaknesses and used his movement technique to unleash over a hundred punches. Since he couldn’t find any weaknesses, he would forcibly destroy it.

Profound Sky Venerable roared as hundreds of runes swept over, and the aura he gave off reached the second-stage Saint Lord.

“You lost,” Lin Yun said.

“That’s a sneak attack, and you lied to me! It doesn’t count!” Profound Sky Venerable said with his face flushed. As his body trembled, countless afterimages flew out before throwing a punch forth.

Lin Yun smiled as he activated three Azure Dragon Divine Runes and faced it head-on with a grin. When their punches collided, heaven and earth began to tremble. They were evenly matched.

Another two Azure Dragon Divine Runes poured into his punch, and immediately formed into a river. This made Profound Sky Venerable’s face change as he roared, unleashing a golden radiance with his cultivation increased to a third-stage Saint Lord.

But before he could catch his breath, Lin Yun continued to attack, which made Profound Sky Venerable barely hold on, even after increasing his cultivation to a seventh-stage Saint Lord.

When Lin Yun flew out, a dragon’s aura appeared with the Azure Dragon Constellation faintly being seen. Lin Yun instantly knew that his ability to take a beating had increased by a few times compared to before, which was ridiculous.

The difference was massive between the Azure Dragon Divine Physique and Divine Dragon Physique. When they fought, Lin Yun could faintly sense the connection with the Azure Dragon Constellation.

Profound Sky Venerable took a deep breath, and saw that when Lin Yun landed on the ground, the ground was split into two. But Lin Yun looked fine, so he stomped his foot and came before Lin Yun.

When their punches clashed, Profound Sky Venerable increased his cultivation again to an eighth-stage Saint Lord. Even so, the Heavenly Metal Armor still showed signs of collapsing, which Profound Sky Venerable couldn’t believe as he increased his cultivation to a Saint Sovereign.

This made Lin Yun squint as he felt immense pressure. He roared, and a golden seal appeared on his forehead, “Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal!”

When they clashed, a dragon’s claw from the Azure Dragon Constellation descended with a light beam enveloping Lin Yun as he connected with it. As they fought again, the Heavenly Medal Armor shattered.

This made Profound Sky Venerable take seven steps back before he regained his footing. He might not have suffered any injuries, but he was embarrassed.

As for Lin Jiangxian and the others, they were completely dumbfounded with disbelief.

“I’m lucky that I’m not the one fighting him,” Xiong Tianan felt fortunate.

“Profound Sky Venerable, you lost,” Lin Yun smiled, cutting his fists as he dispersed the Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal.

Profound Sky Venerable was stumped, before he sighed, “I initially wanted to give you a lesson to tell you that a young man shouldn’t be too arrogant, but I was the one taught a lesson instead.”

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled, but said nothing.

Ji Zixi said, “It’s fine. You’re the one who taught Big Brother Lin about the Divine Dragon Sovereign Pellet, and it’s not embarrassing.”

“It has nothing to do with me or the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet, but he’s destined,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

Lin Yun was stumped. Profound Sky Venerable was an Emperor, so he must’ve noticed something.

“Alright, it is my loss. What request do you want? I can agree to it as long as it’s not too much,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

Lin Yun smiled, and asked, “How many days till we go to Heaven’s Gate?”

“Five days,” Profound Sky Venerable replied.

“For the next five days, can you lend me the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron? It’s not too much, right?” Lin Yun asked with a sincere and harmless expression.

“What are you planning?” Profound Sky Venerable looked at Lin Yun doubtfully.

“What can I possibly do? I just grasped some profundity of the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, and I might be able to grasp the Yin-Yang Dao if you lend it to me,” Lin Yun smiled. The Yin-Yang Dao was an Eternal Dao, and Profound Sky Venerable would sneer at them if someone else said that.

But Profound Sky Venerable witnessed Lin Yun’s fight with Qin Yun, so he said, “That’s not impossible. The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity will bless you.”

“Thank you, Venerable!” Lin Yun rejoiced.

Profound Sky Venerable said, “You’re not allowed to go after the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. It’s the treasure of Heaven’s Gate.”

“Do you think I can subdue the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron?” Lin Yun smiled.

“You? Not even in a hundred years,” the Profound Sky Venerable smiled.

Lin Yun rubbed his nose and said nothing. He immediately came over to the stage before Profound Sky Venerable could take back his words, and he looked at the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron.

He still couldn’t take the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron away now, so he could only plan it step by step. He would first imprint the Blue Dragon Divine Seal on it along with his blood essence, and five days should be enough to do that.

As for the Yin-Yang Dao, it was just an excuse he came up with. But he could also give it a try. If he could succeed, he would have grasped two Eternal Daos!

Lin Yun circulated the Blue Dragon Divine Seal and injected his aura into the cauldron. In the meantime, he also practiced with the Flaming Yin-Yang Painting.

When five days passed, everyone was shocked when they came over with Profound Sky Venerable. They saw that Lin Yun was seated on the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron with a perfect Flaming Yin-Yang Diagram that had perfectly fused with his sword aura and the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron.

It looked like a massive sword was behind Lin Yun from afar.

“Holy shit, don’t tell me that Lin Yun really subdued the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron?” Xiong Tiannan was shocked. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“What are you dreaming about? Even I can only control the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron on the outside, and he’s using it to comprehend Yin-Yang Dao,” Profound Sky Venerable said with disdain. He could tell that Lin Yun already entered the threshold of Yin-Yang Dao, and he could grasp it if he took another step forward.

To grasp an Eternal Dao before becoming a Saint Sovereign, it will surely catch the ancestral deity’s attention. Profound Sky Venerable was more satisfied as he looked at Lin Yun. He smiled, “Alright, you will also have time with the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron in the future. Let’s go now.”

Profound Sky Venerable was confident in himself, while Lin Jiangxian fell into deep thoughts because Lin Yun didn’t look like he was only practicing Yin-Yang Dao.

Opening his eyes, Lin Yun nodded at the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron.

“Come on.” Profound Sky Venerable brought everyone to the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. The runes lit up on the cauldron before it flew to the sky, leaving the Heavenly Barren Realm.

Three days later, at the Heaven’s Gate Star Realm. This was a dazzling star that was the core of Heaven’s Gate. Around the Heaven’s Gate Star Realm were nineteen smaller stars revolving around the Heaven’s Gate Star like satellites.

The Heaven’s Gate Star was massive, and it looked grander than the Kunlun Realm’s holy lands, which amazed Lin Yun. He once heard that some immortal holy lands had stars as satellites, which looked true.

The Heaven’s Gate Star was crowded with countless experts who had gathered together. There were many flying saint artifacts in the sky, but the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron naturally stole everyone’s attention.

On the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron stood Profound Sky Venerable and Lin Yun’s group. They traveled all the way here from the Heavenly Barren Realm, which could also be called the Heaven’s Gate Star Cluster, and the Heavenly Barren Banquet would be held here.
