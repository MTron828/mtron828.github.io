Chapter 467 - But One But Me!

“Xiantian sword intent!”

“Is that really the xiantian sword intent?”

“Who knows. But this sword intent is terrifying. I’ve never seen such terrifying sword intent in my life.”

“Indeed. But isn’t it a little too much if it’s really the xiantian sword intent? Not only the Great Qin Empire, but I bet there’s no one who managed to grasp the xiantian sword intent before reaching the Violet Palace Realm.” Those words made the entire plaza sink into silence.

The stage was severed into two. Lin Yun stood on the stage with his hair fluttering in the wind. Right at this moment, he had completely stolen all of Qin Yu’s limelight.

“Unbelievable…”

“Is Lin Yun going to complete Hell Mode?”

This scene was a miracle that everyone was able to see. No one had been optimistic for Lin Yun, but he had come so far and was only one step away from winning the challenge. Since the beginning of the Dragon Gate Competition, Lin Yun had accomplished things that no one had ever accomplished.

Right at this moment, the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party finally calmed down, especially Xin Yan. A bright smile bloomed on her face that made her look like a bewitching rose. Even Luo Feng had tears rolling down his cheeks from excitement. Even if it wasn’t the xiantian sword intent, there was no way that Qin Yu could block Lin Yun when judging the current situation.

But the shock of the crowd was pale in comparison to Qin Yu’s shock. Sensing the terrifying sword aura coming from Lin Yun, he spoke with a stiffened face, “H-how can you possibly comprehend the xiantian sword intent!”

“Xiantian sword intent? You’re wrong. That wasn’t the xiantian sword intent, but this is!” Lin Yun’s eyes began to light up like stars as a boundless sword intent emitted from him. The sword intent soared into the sky and resonated with all the swords present.

“Damn it, I can’t control my sword!”

“This sword intent is too powerful…”

Many swordsmen were losing control of their swords under Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent and their swords began to fly out.

“This sword is on behalf of Big Brother Xin Jue!” said Lin Yun with a cold killing aura brimming in his eyes. If Xin Jue was here, he would also swing out an attack at Qin Yu with xiantian sword intent. As a boundless sword ray bloomed in Lin Yun’s hand, his sword seemed like a blazing sun that could devour everything in the world.

“Never! I won’t lose!” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with madness as he bit his tongue and pushed the Profound Yang Art to the limit. When he did, fiery runes began to appear on his face.

A terrifying origin energy fluctuated within his body and emitted an even more terrifying aura. Now that he had grasped the xiantian sword intent, Lin Yun knew that he had to bring out everything or there was no way he could obtain the championship.

Raising his head, a fiery palm collided with the sword ray. In the split second when the two attacks clashed, the stage instantly crumbled. But in everyone’s eyes, it felt as though a mountain was crumbling as fragments of the stage constantly fell down.

At the center of the storm, everyone could see a figure penetrating the palm. Shortly after, Qin Yu’s body flew out with blood splattering everywhere. There was no way Qin Yu could take an attack containing the xiantian sword intent even if he pushed the Profound Yang Art to the limit. His chest was stabbed and the wound was terrifying as blood flowed out.

“He lost.” Many people sighed inwardly when they saw this scene. They knew that the championship would go to Lin Yun if nothing went wrong. After all, the differences between them were too great. They were feeling emotional because they might have the opportunity to witness the birth of a legend. When they thought about this, they felt honored.

“Trash,” snorted Lin Yun. His statement shocked everyone. Lin Yun actually called Qin Yu a piece of trash? Who was Qin Yu? Regardless of his status or strength, he stood at the pinnacle of the empire. He had always been the one humiliating others, and no one dared to offend him. But Lin Yun actually called Qin Yu a piece of trash publically in the competition? Just how humiliating was this?

This made Qin Yu’s face pale as though he couldn’t believe what he just heard. He roared, “What did you just say?!”

“Didn’t you call me a sword slave? Didn’t you say that I wasn’t worthy to compete with you for the championship? But it seems like you just lost to a mere sword slave. So what are you if you’re not a piece of trash?” said Lin Yun indifferently as the Flower Burial Sword in his hand buzzed.

No one would believe that someone dared to call the crown prince a piece of trash. In fact, they would be ridiculed for doing so. However, Lin Yun was definitely qualified to do so.

Wielding the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun stepped forward. He executed the Seven Profound Steps and arrived before Qin Yu. Without any hesitation, he swung out his sword executing the Heavenly Cloud Shatter.

In that split second, a terrifying storm formed into a roaring tornado, which shocked Qin Yu. When Lin Yun’s attack slowly got closer to him, the despair in his heart grew.

Damn it. How did this happen… Qin Yu was filled with unwillingness. Even if he knew that he couldn’t block this sword, he still charged forward, pushing the Profound Yang Art to the limit. When he threw out his palm at the tornado, not only did it not weaken the tornado, but he even ended up vomiting blood.

“That’s too terrifying…”

“Is His Highness insane?”

After several strikes, Qin Yu’s face became as pale as a sheet of paper. This was shocking for the crowd to witness. In their eyes, Qin Yu was courting death. But after ten-odd palms, he finally destroyed the tornado.

“Kill!” But before Qin Yu could reveal a smile, Lin Yun raised the Flower Burial Sword and poured his origin energy into it.

Alarm started ringing in Qin Yu’s heart as he vomited blood and quickly retreated. He might be the crown prince, but he looked nothing like one in this pathetic state. Back then, he had acted so grand when marrying Xin Yan. But he was greatly humiliated by Lin Yun, so he declared that he would claim Lin Yun’s life in the Dragon Gate Competition.

But right now, he looked pathetic. He wasn’t able to avoid Lin Yun’s attack, and instead was blown out by it.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun charged forward. But the moment he moved, a horrifying cry came from a dazzling golden radiance that burst out from the pile of rocks that had buried Qin Yu.

Everyone could tell that Qin Yu had brought out his martial soul, but no one had expected that Qin Yu would summon his martial soul, despite knowing he would lose. Wasn’t he afraid that he wouldn’t be able to step into the Violet Palace Realm if his martial soul was damaged?

But in the next second, everyone’s faces changed. Qin Yu soared into the sky with a fiery bird behind him that flickered with three profound rays. This meant that he had a third grade Profound Martial Soul. Not only was it a Profound Martial Soul, but it had also reached the third grade. When the bird unfolded its wings, it unleashed a terrifying blazing aura that pushed back Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent.

“Sword slave, you didn’t expect this scene, right? My martial soul is a third grade Profound Martial Soul, the Infernal Sparrow. It possesses the Azure Phoenix bloodline.” Qin Yu’s face was twisted as though he was under great pressure by using his martial soul. He continued, “I have to endure the burning pain every time I summon it, but you forced me to bring it out! Now, be incinerated to ashes!”

The Infernal Sparrow flew down, incinerating everything within its path.

“This isn’t good!” Everyone’s faces were drained of color because they never imagined that Qin Yu had such a trump card. The black-clothed elder, who was always standing behind Qin Yu, sneered as he looked at Lin Yun. After all, how could Qin Yu attract the attention of the Profound Yang Palace if he didn’t have the Infernal Sparrow? Not to mention that they even made an exception to give him the Profound Yang Art.

But his smile soon froze in the next second because the Primordial Chaotic Soul, the Aurora Dragon, had appeared. After devouring a demonic soul, the Aurora Dragon had also reached the profound grade. But if that was the only change, the black-clothed elder wouldn’t be so shocked.

Behind Lin Yun, another Primordial Chaotic Soul was actually slowly taking form, it was Qiongqi.

When the two Primordial Chaotic Souls appeared, they unleashed their torrential ferocity and pounced at the Infernal Sparrow to tear it apart.

“No!” Qin Yu threw up a mouthful of blood as he fell onto the ground with his knees.

Once the two Primordial Chaotic Souls appeared, Lin Yun had established his presence in the competition. No one but him was qualified to stand out among all the elites in the Great Qin Empire.
