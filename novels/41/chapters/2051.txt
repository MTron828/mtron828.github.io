Chapter 2052 - We'll Wait And See! (1)

Xiahou Yan’s corpse fell to the ground, which made everyone’s hearts throb, and they could feel the surrounding temperature dropping.

“Ye Qingtian, how dare you kill Young Master’s sword servant!” Zhao Hu of the four sword servants roared.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re in deep trouble now! Why aren’t you on your knees, begging for our young master’s forgiveness?” Zhao Bao furiously pointed at Lin Yun and said in an aloof tone.

The faces of everyone from the Eastern Desolation changed because they knew it wasn’t easy to resolve this matter now. They quickly stepped back and put a distance between them and Lin Yun and those from the Sword Sect.

Lin Yun naturally noticed this, but he could do nothing about it. Did these people think the Heavenly Dao Sect feared the Black Plume Palace? At the very least, he was a Great Saint’s direct disciple, not to mention he also had the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint standing behind him. So in terms of background, Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of Zhao Wuji.

“It’s just the death of a dog. What’s the matter? You guys want to carry on?” Lin Yun said indifferently. “I remember someone saying anyone can kill his sword servant if they can.”

Zhao Hu furiously clenched his fists together and roared, “What’s the matter? You just killed White Wolf and even want to kill me?”

The four sword servants of Zhao Wuji had fearsome strength. As everyone had just witnessed White Wolf and Zhao Quan’s strength, everyone from the Eastern Desolation feared the remaining three, especially Zhao Hu.

“If you dare to be presumptuous, I don’t mind killing you as well,” Lin Yun said, raising his head to look at Zhao Hu.

But what Ye Qingtian said shocked everyone. They didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to be so confident. Did that mean he had the strength to back it up? When they arrived in Nether Ethereal City, they instantly noticed the difference between the swordsmen from the Eastern Desolation and other regions, and this was a great blow to their confidence.

Not to mention their morale was trampled on by Zhao Wuji’s sword servants earlier, forming a shadow looming over their hearts. This was why they were surprised by Ye Qingtian’s confidence and admired his courage.

Zhao Hu turned to look at Zhao Wuji, who lightly nodded. Zhao Hu grinned and sinisterly looked at Lin Yun, “Since you’re courting death, I don’t mind fulfilling your request!”

“Use my sword,” Zhao Wuji waved his hand, and a radiant saint sword flew over to Zhao Hu. This was an extraordinary saint sword engraved with a gloryfire spirit.

When Zhao Hu grabbed the sword, hundreds of sword rays flew out from his body, lighting up the entire plaza.

Zhao Quan stood beside Zhao Wuji and said with a grave expression, “White Wolf was stronger than me, but Ye Qingtian killed him so easily. He’s not simple, and I’m afraid the boss will be in danger.”

Zhao Wuji raised the cup and indifferently said, “Zhao Hu has been stuck at a bottleneck for a long time, so he’ll benefit in his fight with Ye Qingtian. He can also help me probe Ye Qingtian’s strength. I have long heard of this person, so this is a good opportunity for me to see his strength.”

Zhao Wuji wasn’t bothered by Xiahou Yan’s death because the latter was only a dog in his eyes. But Xiahou Yan’s death made Zhao Wuji pay attention to Ye Qingtian and he wanted to see the latter’s strength.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was perfect to have Zhao Hu probe Ye Qingtian’s strength. If possible, he might even benefit from the fight between them.

Lin Yun and Zhao Hu stood a few hundred meters from each other. Before the two clashed, their sword auras collided with sparks flying around.

In the next moment, Lin Yun and Zhao Hu moved at an unbelievable speed. There were only sword rays and phenomena blooming as they both executed the first section of the Divine Firefly Sword. But Lin Yun executed it with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. In contrast, Zhao Hu executed it with the Black Plume Sword Canon, and the phenomena created by their sword techniques differed.

As they clashed, the surrounding space began to distort with their sword rays clashing and sword vibrations echoing. After a brief clash, Lin Yun and Zhao Hu both separated from each other.

“To reach complete mastery in the first section of the Divine Firefly Sword as a sword servant, you’ve given me a huge surprise. As expected of the Black Plume Palace,” Lin Yun said, holding onto the Flower Burial Sword.

But Zhao Hu didn’t seem happy with the praises because Lin Yun’s indifference made him feel that he was being underestimated. Zhao Hu retorted, “To last so long while being at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage, you have also given me a huge surprise.”

When Zhao Hu finished, he let out a tiger roar, but it was an illusion that lasted briefly. When everyone came to their senses from the illusion, Zhao Hu appeared behind Ye Qingtian and his sword thrusting towards Ye Qingtian’s neck.

The speed that Zhao Hu executed wasn’t slower than a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase. If his opponent was a fellow genius at the same cultivation level, his opponent’s head would probably fly from their neck without even being able to see his sword.

But Ye Qingtian didn’t dodge or even turn around, but merely swung his sword to his back, blocking the incoming attack. As sparks flew, Zhao Hu squinted his eyes and was shocked because Ye Qingtian managed to catch the trajectory of his attack.

After blocking Zhao Hu’s attack, Lin Yun released his grip on the Flower Burial Sword and spun in mid-air before grabbing the Flower Burial Sword once more. While facing Zhao Hu, he thrust the Flower Burial Sword towards Zhao Hu’s chest.

This made Zhao Hu’s face change, and quickly retreated, not daring to face Lin Yun’s attack head-on.

When Lin Yun moved, his speed wasn’t inferior to Zhao Hu, and had unleashed another attack, thrusting his sword at Zhao Hu’s wrist.

Zhao Hu had no choice but to change his attack and move before unleashing another attack at Ye Qingtian. But Ye Qingtian stepped back as though he had foreseen Zhao Hu’s attack with the Flower Burial Sword aimed at Zhao Hu’s forehead.

As the two began to flash around, they exchanged a few hundred moves in just a few breaths. In everyone’s eyes, Zhao Hu was strong, regardless of his cultivation or sword aura, but he was forced to retreat whenever he faced Ye Qingtian, which meant he was in a disadvantageous position.

Only a few people could see their figures and blurred trajectories flashing around.

“He’s too powerful. In regards to the attainment of sword dao alone, Ye Qingtian is much stronger than Zhao Hu,” Zhao Quan said beside Zhao Wuji.

Zhao Wuji nodded, “I only know that the Dao Yang Holy Son is strong. I never expected that the Heavenly Dao Sect would have such a strong inheritance in sword dao, and it looks like I made the right decision to come here. But no one said swordsmen can only use their swords, and it’s not easy for Ye Qingtian to win!”

Zhao Hu retreated and suffered a few wounds on his body, and his injuries looked sinister. On the contrary, Lin Yun maintained his composure without any wounds on his body.

“Ye Qingtian is holding the upper hand in the fight!” Right then, most of the surrounding swordsmen came to their senses.

“The Heavenly Dao Sect is truly worthy of being the strongest holy land within the Eastern Desolation. It looks like I’ve underestimated you, but you’re a lot weaker than I’ve imagined,” Zhao Wuji said.

“Oh?” Lin Yun smiled fearlessly.

Zhao Hu smiled sinisterly and took out a bead. As he poured nirvana aura into the bead, the bead began to shine brightly. This glory saint artifact contained a droplet of an ancient demon clan’s blood. The immense power was sweeping towards Lin Yun.
