Chapter 468 - Qin Yu’s Death

Lin Yun stood domineeringly with the Aurora Dragon and Qiongqi standing behind him. Lying on the ground, Qin Yu’s face was pale with disbelief in his eyes. He knew that he was finished. His trump card was nothing before the two Primordial Chaotic Beasts and he had nothing else to fight against Lin Yun with.

This competition should be my stage, so why? Why did this sword slave get to laugh in the end?!

“Final match, Lin Yun wins!” announced the judge. This instantly caused an uproar in the plaza because no one was optimistic for Lin Yun since the beginning, but he had created a legend. There was no previous success in Hell Mode, but he did it.

“Champion!” Luo Feng sighed out in relief. It hadn’t been easy on Lin Yun. No one felt that he was weak or he wasn’t talented enough. Previously, Luo Feng had only felt that Lin Yun was too young. In fact, he felt that the competition three years from now would be Lin Yun’s stage, but he actually became the champion today. Speaking of which, it was Luo Feng who registered Lin Yun back then. Just thinking about it placed a smile on his face.

“Hahaha! Champion!” Li Wuyou clenched his fists together.

Xin Yan didn’t utter a word, but her eyes were watery. She was the one who recruited Lin Yun back then and she watched how he grew, step by step. She even saw how he was targeted in the test to how he gave his promise to her big brother.

It hadn’t been an easy journey for Lin Yun and he was bearing too much on his shoulders. Despite all that, he still managed to come this far.

“I’m rich,” said a youth wearing a hat in the crowd. He knew that he was going to be rich based on his bet on Lin Yun.

Since there were those who rejoiced, there were naturally those who became worried. Wen Yanbo’s face was stiffened the moment Lin Yun brought out his xiantian sword intent. The Sword Cloud Pavilion was also filled with hatred for Lin Yun and had hoped for Lin Yun to be killed by Qin Yu. As for the Heavenly Profound Sect, their faces were dark as they kept their silence.

On the guest seat, Emperor Qin remained in his seat without uttering a word as he closed his eyes. No one knew what he was thinking right now.

On the contrary, the princess smiled, but no one could see her smile since the veil covered her face. With that, the final ranking in the Dragon Gate Competition had been determined with Lin Yun becoming the champion. Nothing else mattered at this moment because Lin Yun was the center of the spotlight at this moment.

“Champion? No, I’m the champion!” Qin Yu struggled back up on his feet with madness on his face.

“Prince Qin, the outcome has already been decided…”

“Get lost!”

The judge wanted to stop Qin Yu, but he was terrified when he saw the madness and hatred in Qin Yu’s eyes. He knew that Qin Yu would attack him if he didn’t do as Qin Yu commanded. This instantly made him fall into a dilemma because he had no idea if he should let Qin Yu pass.

Based on Qin Yu’s current state, any attack from Lin Yun would be lethal. But in the end, the judge still stepped aside.

Qin Yu raised his palm at Lin Yun, who had sheathed his sword and unsummoned his martial souls. As he was pushing the Profound Yang Art to the limit, fiery runes appeared on his face. This made Lin Yun frown his eyebrows because Qin Yu was showing signs of running amok. All he did was slightly step to the side to avoid Qin Yu’s attack.

“Haha, you’re afraid now! A sword slave like you dares to compete with me for the championship?!” Qin Yu launched a barrage of palms and his attack caused a terrifying shockwave that spread out to the surroundings.

The spectators were all shocked by this scene. Did the crown prince really go insane? The outcome was already determined, so did Qin Yu really think that he could change the outcome by going insane? They all thought that Qin Yu was a little too naive. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Watching Qin Yu’s attacks become more and more ruthless, Lin Yun was ultimately forced to attack. He knew that he would be injured if Qin Yu’s attacks reached him, but he wasn’t stupid enough to allow Qin Yu to hit him.

“Stop!” barked the black-clothed elder.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he held back his attack. But the moment he did, Qin Yu’s palm landed on his chest. When Qin Yu’s origin energy infiltrated into his body, it caused a burning pain to Lin Yun’s internal organs and blood dripped out from his mouth.

“Hehe, the battle hasn’t come to an end. The championship belongs to me!” Seeing that Lin Yun was pushed back by him, Qin Yu became even more fanatical and threw another palm at Lin Yun.

Qin Yu was pushing it. Did he really think that Lin Yun was afraid of him? A cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes and he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, “You’re courting death!”

When the two palms came into contact, Qin Yu threw up a mouthful of blood and he was sent flying. When Qin Yu landed on the ground, a figure landed on the stage and looked at Lin Yun coldly, “Didn’t you hear what I said?”

That person was naturally the black-clothed elder who had always been beside Qin Yu.

“I did, but I was forced to retaliate due to a certain rabies infected dog… or are you asking me to stand here and get killed by this piece of trash? Sorry, but no can do,” replied Lin Yun indifferently.

“Who are you to interfere in the competition?” questioned the judge with his brows frowned.

“I’m a deacon of the Profound Yang Palace, Ji Yun! Qin Yu is the disciple of my martial uncle and I’m worried about his safety. Why can’t I come on the stage?” The black-clothed elder stared at the judge. His words instantly caused an uproar because the Profound Yang Palace was an overlord even in the Ancient Southern Domain. No one in the empire dared to offend any of their disciples.

“The Profound Yang Palace… No wonder His Highness dares to act so wantonly. So he has the Profound Yang Palace backing him up.”

“Yeah. He doesn't have to hold any responsibility even if he kills Lin Yun here.”

“Lin Yun stole the championship from Qin Yu, so he has probably offended the Profound Yang Palace deeply.”

“I heard that His Highness had someone backing him. It must be real now that someone from the Profound Yang Palace stood out.”

Everyone’s face changed when the black-clothed elder revealed his identity. At the same time, Luo Feng also came down from the guest seats to stand in front of Lin Yun. He looked at Ji Yun coldly. The other disciples and elders also came up and surrounded Lin Yun.

“Even if you’re a deacon from the Profound Yang Palace, isn’t it a little too rude to reprimand a disciple of my Sword Firmament Pavilion?” asked Luo Feng with a grave voice.

“R-royal father, it feels terrible…” Qin Yu, who was on the ground, suddenly revealed a painful expression, which instantly attracted everyone’s attention. Blood was seeping out of the fiery runes on Qin Yu’s face.

“No!” Emperor Qin’s face finally changed and he rushed over to Qin Yu. But before he could even get close, Qin Yu began to blaze with fire. Everyone could only hear a miserable shirek coming from Qin Yu. It was too late for Emperor Qin or the Profound Yang Palace’s deacon to do anything.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu was incinerated to ashes, which left everyone shocked. Qin Yu died? They couldn’t believe that he had been incinerated to ashes in front of their eyes.

Many people thought of something, but no one dared to say it out aloud. He had run amok. There was no doubt in anyone’s mind that Qin Yu had ran amok. This was the outcome of him pushing the earth grade cultivation technique recklessly in his fight with Lin Yun.

Many people noticed it when fiery runes appeared on Qin Yu’s face. This was clearly a sign that he couldn’t fully control the Profound Yang Art. He had reached his limit of being able to control it when he was defeated, not to mention that Qin Yu continued to fight even further, which pushed him closer to death.

Qin Yu's death was his fault and no one else could be blamed. But then again, not everyone shared the same thought.

“Lin Yun, how dare you! The competition has already come to an end, yet you still dared to kill my son. Are you disregarding my presence?!” Emperor Qin raged with killing aura boiling from his body. This was the rage coming from a Heavenly Soul Realm cultivator.
