Chapter 2229 - Othershore Flower

This place is the deity’s corpse? Lin Yun came to his senses. It was no wonder why he sensed some spatial fluctuation when he crossed the Flame Dragon River. The deity’s corpse had formed its own space, and the Flame Dragon River was like a teleportation array that brought them in.

The Heavenly Void was the deity’s corpse. Or rather, the deity’s corpse had merged with the Heavenly Void and became a world of its own.

Lin Yun asked a few more questions and found out that these Blood Crows were born in the deity’s corpse and formed by the sins of the deity’s corpse when the deity was still alive. Even if they were killed, they would fuse into the deity’s corpse and be born again a hundred years later. As a result, the Blood Crows weren’t afraid of death as long as they were in the deity’s corpse.

There were powerful Blood Crows here, and they had fused as one with the corpses of humans in the Heavenly Void, possessing complete bodies. They were known as the Blood Crow Kings.

The Blood Crow youth feared Lin Yun would refine him into a bead, so he didn’t hold anything back from the latter.

“Where’s the Divine Blood Fruit?” Lin Yun asked.

“Divine Blood Fruit?” The Blood Crow youth’s eyes flickered, then said, “I’ve never heard of it before.”

“It looks like you’re not being honest!” Lil’ Purple was pissed and wanted to torture him again.

“I don’t know. The Heavenly Void is massive, and each Blood Crow King has their territory and servants. There would often be a battle amongst Blood Crow Kings, and we don’t dare to wander around. If we leave our territory, we might be enslaved and become servants…” According to the Blood Crow youth, this was only the edge of the Heavenly Void, and many Blood Crow Kings were inside.

“If there’s really a Divine Blood Fruit, it should be in the Blood Flame Plains. That’s the heart of the deity’s corpse.” The Blood Crow youth pointed out a direction to Lin Yun. This was all he knew. He hadn’t gone to the Blood Flame Plains before.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and asked, “You seem to be afraid of me. Have you heard of me?”

“Many Demonspirits have appeared in the Heavenly Void before, and those Demonspirits were really powerful. Even Blood Crow Kings have been killed by them,” the Blood Crow youth said, trembling. “They mentioned you and said that a Great Saint of the Demonspirit Clan was dead because of you. So they’re filled with hatred for you.”

Lin Yun didn’t know why the death of that Golden-Eyed Demonspirit was on him when Tian Xing killed it. But he didn’t explain himself and said, “Last question. Do you know the location of a woman?”

Lin Yun roughly explained Su Ziyao’s appearance to him, and the Blood Crow youth shook his head at first before he replied, “I recall it now. Someone like that does exist, but I’ve never seen her before. I only heard from the Demonspirit Clan and a group of human cultivators that they’re looking for her. She’s in the Heavenly Void, but no one knows where she is.”

Lin Yun heaved a sigh of relief, hearing that Su Ziyao was still alive.

“What should we do with him?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“You can just kill me. Everything is fine as long as you don’t refine me into a bead,” the Blood Crow youth said in a trembling tone.

Lin Yun had no way of refining this Blood Crow youth into a bead and had no intention of killing him. He merely used the Nether Shackles to leave a restraint within the Blood Crow youth’s body, and got the latter to follow him. The Blood Crows here couldn’t be killed, and it was hard to find more information. So, leaving the Blood Crow youth behind was better than killing him.

Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple headed to the Blood Flame Plains for the next period of time. On the way over, Lil’ Red woke up and reached the Saint Realm, which meant their small team had become stronger.

The Blood Crow youth wasn’t lying. This place was dangerous because the Blood Crow Kings had a strong sense of territory. They would attack anyone that they have discovered, and several battles occurred over the past few days.

There was one time when they ran into a Blood Crow King, and Lin Yun had to push the Divine Sunchasing Art to the limit before he could escape. The endless battles exhausted Lin Yun, while Lil' Red became more excited. After all, it had just become a Saint Lord and wanted to show off its strength. As a result, Lil’ Red would always stand at the front whenever there was a battle.

The Blood Crow youth’s scalp was numb because even Lin Yun’s cat was so powerful. He was thoroughly afraid now and said in a trembling tone, “Up ahead is the territory of the Asura Dove King’s territory. The Asura Dove King obtained the corpse of an ancient swordsman in the Heavenly Void, and he’s incredibly powerful. He’s also brutal with absolute confidence in his strength. So he didn’t need many servants, and everyone that he has captured would be used to refine his sword.”

“Refining his sword with Blood Crows? What use do the Blood Crows have?” Lin Yun asked.

Seeing that Lin Yun was looking down on Blood Crows, the Blood Crow youth became furious, and said, “We’re born from the deity’s blood in the Heavenly Void, and one can refine the divine blood if they refine us in great numbers, and it’s much better than the beads. We’re nobles, unlike those country bumpkins from the Myriad Grave Valley. The sword refined by the Asura Dove King is a famous treasure in the Heavenly Void.”

“I see…” When he looked at the latter again, Lin Yun finally knew how to deal with the Blood Crow youth.

Lin Yun’s gaze made the Blood Crow youth feel a chill run down his spine, and he said, “D-Don’t. Even if you’ve managed to refine all my blood, you wouldn’t be able to produce a trace of divine blood. Just kill me.”

“You’re a coward, and yet you call yourself noble?” Lil’ Red said with disdain, making the Blood Crow youth’s face turn red, but he didn’t dare to refute it. He realized that the three before him were terrifying, with Flower Burial being the most terrifying. He could feel a chill run down his spine with a gaze from Lin Yun. The little girl’s mouth was filled with insults, and this cat was the most ruthless one who would make a move without saying a word.

Lil’ Red was full of energy after making a breakthrough, so the Blood Crow youth frequently received a beating during this period.

Lin Yun didn’t want to take a detour and planned to immediately cross this region. As for the Asura Dove King, it was best if they didn’t encounter each other. The Asura Dove King had a huge territory that was on the scale of a sect in the outside world. But in reality, this place was the ruins of an ancient sect, and there were many tattered buildings here.

“I’ll go take a look.” Lin Yun stopped just when he was a few hundred miles from the Asura Dove King’s territory. His sword intent was keen, and he could sense some ripples here. He came to the top of a stone pillar and circulated his sword intent. As golden light shone from his eyes, his vision began to spread out, and he could see everything within a thousand-mile radius.

“Follow me,” Lin Yun said as he led everyone in their journey through the Asura Dove King’s territory. Since he had scouted the territory in advance, they managed to avoid many of the patrolling Blood Crows before they came to a sword mound. This sword mound was ancient and massive, and many corpses were on the ground next to rusted ancient swords.

There were three people in the sword mound, rummaging through all the corpses. An eye opened on their foreheads as they executed some sort of secret technique, releasing a black miasma from their bodies. As the black miasma entered the corpses, the corpses were soon repaired and stood up like living corpses.

“The Demonspirit Clan!” The Blood Crow youth was shocked by this scene and asked, “What are they doing?”

“This is an ancient conversion method from the Demonspirit Clan, using their demonic eye and miasma to turn a dead cultivator into a demonic corpse. After the end of the Golden Era, these people relied on this method to wreak havoc in the Kunlun Realm,” Lin Yun said.

Lin Yun might seem calm, but he was greatly shocked. He had faced demonic corpses before in various ruins, but this was the first time he had witnessed a Demonspirit performing the conversion technique. After the death of many cultivators from the Kunlun Realm, their corpses would be enslaved by the Demonspirit Clan and swing their blades against their own kind.

“This is a little troublesome,” Lil’ Purple said. “This is the Heavenly Void, and countless saints are here from ancient times. If they can gather enough Saint Realm demonic corpses, it would be troublesome when the restriction on the God Burial Mountain Range is lifted…”

Lin Yun wore a grave expression, and said it for her, “The Dark Era would return.”

Times have changed, but the darkness was still scheming a return. Now that he looked at it, the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan must have more objectives in coming to the Heavenly Void.

When a crimson streak of light flew over and landed on the ground, a young-looking Demonspirit appeared on the sword mound. He had perfect features, and didn’t look like a Demonspirit. Instead, he looked like a handsome human with skin that even girls would be jealous of, and his white robe gave him a unique temperament.

“We greet the Ying River King.” The three Demonspirits bowed with respect on their faces. Only Silver-Eyed Demonspirit and Golden-Eyed Demonspirit could be addressed as kings.

Lin Yun immediately sensed something wasn’t right and released his sword intent to envelop everyone. They were fortunate that this was a sword mound, filled with sword intent. This place was perfect for them to conceal themselves. But even so, Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless.

“The Asura Dove King’s territory has a lot of treasures. There’s an Othershore Flower. You guys give it a droplet of divine blood each to speed its growth. I want to refine this Othershore Flower here,” the Ying River King said as he took out a crimson flower with a wave. This flower was gorgeous, emitting a faint radiance with slender branches that looked like a girl’s arm.

As the flower danced, everyone could hear beautiful music lingering in their ears when the Demonspirits planted the Othershore Flower into the ground and took out a droplet of divine blood each, pouring it on the flower. They wanted to force the flower's growth and would need to exhaust their vitality and life force, as well as their divine blood.

Since it’s under Ying River King’s orders, the three Demonspirits didn’t dare to go against this order. They sat around the Othershore Flower and began injecting their life force and vitality into it. As the Othershore Flower swayed, it soon reached over ten meters in height, looking bewitching.

Lin Yun could hold himself back, but the Flower Burial Sword began to tremble. He could do nothing about it because the Flower Burial Sword didn’t have any resistance against rare flowers, not to mention one like the Othershore Flower.

Lin Yun’s face changed as he quickly stopped the Flower Burial Sword. He was fortunate that the other swords in the sword mound were also trembling.

Even so, Ying River King still glanced in his direction with doubt in his eyes. When he closed and reopened his eyes, a powerful demonic aura swept out, making Lin Yun feel great pressure. This fellow was definitely a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit!Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“A rat who hasn’t even reached the Saint Realm.” Ying River King sneered as saint energy gathered in his palm with a terrifying energy fluctuation spreading out.

Just when Lin Yun was about to make a move, a sword ray descended from the sky, forcing the Ying River King to dodge as a crimson sword plunged into the ground. All the other rusted swords in the sword mound scattered as a powerful crimson sword intent exploded from the sword.

Up in the sky, there was a figure hovering there, coldly looking at the Ying River King. This person had an incredibly robust figure, and many of the Blood Crows around him made his clothes flutter from the wind. This person was the Asura Dove King, the master of this territory.

The Asura Dove King looked at the Ying River King, and coldly said, “Our transaction has only involved corpses. It has nothing to do with this Othershore Flower.”

“We can make another transaction,” the Ying River King smiled. “Divine blood for this Othershore Flower.”

The Asura Dove King didn’t speak as he looked at the Ying River King, before muttering, “So the Othershore Flower has to mature in this way. No wonder there's been no changes in my hands for so long.”

“Fifteen droplets of divine blood,” the Ying River King increased the stake.

As greed flashed across the Asura Dove King’s eyes, he said, “I’m curious. Where did you get so much divine blood from? After all, you have given me ten divine blood for our previous transaction. I would agree if it were the past, but I have changed my mind. They will all be mine after killing you!”

The Ying River King smiled, “What a coincidence because I was also planning to do the same.”

A golden vertical eye opened on the Ying River King’s forehead as he gave off a powerful aura as a fourth-stage Saint Lord.

But the Ying River King wasn’t afraid, and he waved his hand, “Rahu!”

The Rahu Sword flew into his hand with an Astral Sword Intent blooming, and ten-odd galaxies appeared. The Ying River Demonspirit was afraid that the shockwave of their battle might affect the Othershore Flower, so he rose to the sky and they fought a thousand miles away.

Their battle produced loud explosions with shockwaves sweeping from a thousand miles away, destroying the many tattered palaces.

The three Demonspirit each reached out with one hand to cast a barrier that enveloped the sword mound.

Lin Yun looked at the Othershore Flower outside the sword mound, then turned his head to the Blood Crow youth, “Ji Feng, it’s not too much to retrieve an Othershore Flower before the Divine Blood Fruit, right?”
