Chapter 1555 - Subduing The Demonic Rune TigerUpstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

As Lin Yun shuttled through the forest, he was so quick that his surroundings blurred, and others could only see a beam of light streaking across the forest if they looked at him.

“Interesting…” Lin Yun smiled and was surprised that the Demonic Rune Tiger was leading him elsewhere. From this alone, he could tell that the Demonic Rune Tiger had high intelligence. But Lin Yun naturally played along with it, wanting to see what it was trying to do.

Four hours later, the Demonic Rune Tiger stopped in a black valley and turned back to look at Lin Yun, baring its fangs, “Sword Sect’s disciple, do you still remember this king?”

As it spoke, it changed into a humanoid form while retaining its furry head and had crossed its arms together in front of it.

“I naturally do.” Lin Yun smiled. “Someone I have already defeated.”

The Demonic Rune Tiger tried to launch a sneak attack on him back then, but Lin Yun easily forced it to retreat with a palm, causing it to flee. Since Lin Yun was in a rush back then, he didn’t bother with the Demonic Rune Tiger. But he didn’t expect that he would run into this tiger again.

Lin Yun held onto his chin, looking relaxed. Even Lil’ Red, standing on his shoulder, looked relaxed. It was probably fate that brought them together again.

But the Demonic Rune Tiger flew into a rage when Lin Yun mentioned the past, and its demonic aura started surging from its body. When the tiger released its demonic aura, the already dark sky turned red under the influence.

“Ha. You remember me, and you still dare to follow me. I don’t know if you’re courting death or bold.” The Demonic Rune Tiger coldly said. “Now, I can easily kill you with a palm.”

As crimson flames blazed in its pupils, the Demonic Rune Tiger’s aura continued to climb and a black demonic light began to gather in its palm.

“Dragon origin?” Lin Yun could sense a wisp of danger from the black demonic light, which was probably the dragon origin.

“Ha. Are you scared now? But since you’re in my territory, don’t think about leaving!” The Demonic Rune Tiger laughed. Three figures descended into the valley when the Demonic Rune Tiger was done speaking. They were a wolf, an ape, and a leopard. They were all overlord demonic beasts at the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm and were a lot stronger than the Indigocloud Demonic Python that Lin Yun previously faced.

This was a luxurious formation to deal with an Elysium Core Realm cultivator. But disappointment flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, since he was expecting something more. Then again, it also made sense because the Demonic Rune Tiger had clearly just made a breakthrough. So even if it was a monarch demonic beast, it wasn’t easy to find underlings in such a short time. It was already impressive that it could subdue three overlord demonic beasts.

The Demonic Rune Tiger’s pupils were sharp, and it raged when it saw the disappointment flashing across Lin Yun’s pupils, “A mere Elysium Core Realm fry like you dares to underestimate this king?! You’re courting death!”

The demonic light in its hand blazed into flames before pressing down towards Lin Yun as it raised its hand. As flames swiftly revolved, they enveloped this entire region, looking like an astral vortex that was swinging down. This made Lin Yun slightly furrow his brows. The Demonic Rune Tiger’s control over its demonic aura was too terrifying. It was completely different from the Indigocloud Demonic Python.

Simultaneously, the three Dragon Pulse Realm demonic beasts roared as they pounced at Lin Yun. Without needing Lin Yun to give instructions, Lil’ Red took out a dagger and leaped towards the three demonic beasts.

Just when the Demonic Rune Tiger’s attack was about to land, Lin Yun raised his hand and threw a punch out. When the ancient ‘heaven’ word collided with the flames, an explosion occurred with fine cracks spreading out within the surrounding space, creating a terrific phenomenon.

“Haha! Lil’ Tiger, I’m more interested in your demon clan’s cultivation technique now!” Lin Yun smiled with his eyes squinted.

“Hmph. It looks like you won’t give up until you reach the rope’s end!” The Demonic Rune Tiger’s eyes flashed with ferocity as he waved his hand. As fine cracks spread out on a mountain far away, a terrifying chill began to spread with snowflakes falling.

This shocked Lin Yun, while the Demonic Rune Tiger sinisterly laughed, “Blade!”

When the mountain exploded, a snow-white blade flew into the sky and landed in the Demonic Rune Tiger’s hand. When the Demonic Rune Tiger wielded the saint blade, a terrifying aura swept out. It then swung its blade down without hesitation.

Facing the Demonic Rune Tiger’s attack, Lin Yun didn’t even draw his sword and raised his hand to block this attack. The immense weight from the Demonic Rune Tiger’s attack made Lin Yun’s feet sink into the ground as a terrifying chilly outburst spread out.

Before Lin Yun could be shocked, the Demonic Rune Tiger continued to ferociously swing its sword down. Whenever the Demonic Rune Tiger flashed, he would leave behind afterimages in the air, and each afterimage was enveloped in a terrifying demonic aura.

But Lin Yun didn’t panic as he retreated by using the Divine Sunchasing Art. It didn’t take long for the two to exchange over a hundred moves. After a hundred exchanges, exhaustion flashed on the Demonic Rune Tiger’s face.

It thought it would be easy to kill Lin Yun after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm. But after revealing multiple trump cards, Lin Yun didn’t even bother drawing his sword to face him.

“Roaring Mountains and Rivers!” The Demonic Rune Tiger roared. A bizarre soundwave containing dragon origin swept out as a black light shone from the blade in its hand.

Cracks began to spread out on the ‘heaven’ and ‘earth’ words, before they swiftly started to collapse. When the Demonic Rune Tiger’s blade reached him, it hacked out eighteen blades.

The weight of each blade was heavy, containing a terrifying aura that felt like it could shatter a mountain. With the heavy power of each blade, paired with the Demonic Rune Tiger’s cultivation in the Dragon Pulse Realm and its bloodline as a monarch demonic beast; it only made the Demonic Rune Tiger’s attacks even more terrifying.

But Lin Yun had no changes on his face as a sword ray flashed, blocking the opposing the blade rays. Lin Yun finally drew his Flower Burial Sword and fended off the eighteen blades without taking a step back.

“Profound!” Lin Yun muttered after facing the eighteen blades. As he swiftly wrote an ancient ‘profound’ word, his sword rays turned black like ink.

When the ancient ‘profound’ word appeared, it was like a shield in front of the Flower Burial Sword. When the Demonic Rune Tiger’s blade ray overlapped and landed on the ancient ‘profound’ word, a huge ravine reaching a few thousand feet appeared on the ground, but Lin Yun didn’t take a single step back.

In the next second, Lin Yun shook his wrist and a dazzling sword ray exploded. The ancient ‘profound’ word was radiating brightly. As the rebound force exploded, the Demonic Tiger Rune flew back with eighteen sword wounds on its body.

“I see…” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered. The Profound Sword Form’s profundity lied in rebound force. As long as his opponent couldn’t instantly destroy the ‘profound’ word, their attacks would be bounced back.

As the Demonic Rune Tiger struggled back up, it threw out a mouthful of blood and looked at Lin Yun with shock, “H-How is this possible?! Why can’t my blade technique injure you?”

Simultaneously, all the three demonic beasts behind it fell to the ground. Lil’ Red had easily defeated its opponents without any problem.

“You can be proud that you’re able to force me to use the third sword as a demonic beast.” Lin Yun said. Most demonic beasts didn’t know martial techniques and would suffer a loss when fighting with human cultivators. The Demonic Rune Tiger’s strength was terrifying, and no Elysium Core Realm expert could suppress, it aside from nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm geniuses that were ranked in the top hundredths on the Elysium Core Ranking. But it was a pity that it ran into Lin Yun.

“Unconvinced? This is something left behind by the Southern Emperor, so you can be proud to force me to use the third sword…” Lin Yun shook his head. The Demonic Rune Tiger had no idea how strong the Southern Emperor was and thought Lin Yun was underestimating him.

“Brat, you can’t stop me if I want to leave!” The Demonic Rune Tiger snorted as it began to flee, not intending to fight any longer.

As a cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, he didn’t intend to play with the Demonic Rune Tiger this time. If he allowed it to escape again, he would be letting down all the seclusion he went into. He sheathed his sword and stabbed it into the ground before looking in the direction the Demonic Rune Tiger ran in.

Circulating the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, a Netherflower with twenty-four petals appeared behind him. When the Netherflower appeared and completed a cycle, Lin Yun unleashed a sword ray from his finger.

The sword ray instantly caught up with the Demonic Rune Tiger, forcing it to turn around and raise its blade to fend off Lin Yun’s attack. But Lin Yun didn’t stop there. The Netherflower circulated another cycle before he unleashed another sword ray with a finger flick.

The sword rays were like machine guns, shooting out whenever Lin Yun flicked his fingers. After eighteen explosions, the Demonic Rune Tiger fell onto its knees and couldn’t move. Using the Flicking Divine Finger with the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra could injure the Demonic Rune Tiger and erode the Demonic Rune Tiger’s demonic aura and vitality. The Demonic Rune Tiger was gasping for breath since it was greatly weakened to the limit and shrunken in size.

Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword!

As Lin Yun spread his arms, he hovered in the air, and the Netherflower shattered into pieces, with every petal forming a sea of flowers. When the twenty-four seas of flowers overlapped, they pushed Lin Yun’s sword aura to a new height.

Clouds covered a thousand miles in radius as sword intent seemed to have dragged the heavens down. As long as he pushed his arms forth, the twenty-four seas of flowers would manifest into sword rays that would pour down on the Demonic Rune Tiger.

“Spare my life!” The Demonic Rune Tiger was scared silly as it tossed its blade to the side.

With a wave of his hand, Lin Yun summoned the Flower Burial Sword back to his hand and stood before the Demonic Rune Tiger. While he hovered in the sky with the seas of flowers raging behind him, he was like a king as he looked down on the Demonic Rune Tiger, “Where did you get your demon clan’s martial technique from?”

“Milord, I’ll lead you there.” The Demonic Rune Tiger was obedient and didn’t dare to disobey Lin Yun’s orders. It then returned to its tiger form before leading the way. A black figure flew over to the tiger. Lil’ Red had landed on the back of the Demonic Rune Tiger and even turned back to give Lin Yun a grin.

“This fool is still the same as before.” Lin Yun smiled as he dismissed the seas of flowers. The Flicking Divine Finger was already terrifying without using the sword at the Netherflower’s heart. So he couldn’t imagine how terrifying it would be after using that sword. The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra and Flicking Divine Finger were simply a perfect match, and Lin Yun could finally use this secret technique.

Recollecting his thoughts, he raised his head and discovered that the Demonic Rune Tiger was already gone with Lil’ Red.

“That fool is still so anxious about treasures.” Lin Yun smiled. Then again, it wasn’t surprising because the demon clan’s martial techniques definitely had a more significant attraction to Lil’ Red.
