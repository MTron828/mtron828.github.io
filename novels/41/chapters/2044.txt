Chapter 2045 - Trembling In Anger

“The forging of the Emperor Sword is related to the owner of the flames that you’ve obtained,” the white-clothed man said. He continued, “I’m certain that you were able to see the Emperor Sword because it had recognized the flames. But you said it’s afraid of you, and I’m baffled about this.”

“Perhaps it’s a misperception. It’s probably not willing to leave with me. Speaking of which, what kind of place is that sword mound?” Lin Yun asked. Actually, Lin Yun had a feeling that the Emperor Sword was afraid of his ‘broken sword’ physique.

“I’ve only read bits and pieces about it from the ancient records. It is a mysterious sword mound with many divine swords that have been buried there. But I don’t know where it is located, exactly,” the white-clothed man said.

“I’ll bring the sword back, if there’s an opportunity,” Lin Yun replied.

“You better sort out your matters first. The Hidden Sword Manor isn’t as easy as you think,” the white-clothed man smiled.

“Senior, you’re not optimistic about me?” Lin Yun asked.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“It won’t be easy. The Sword Alliance gathers all of the sword dao holy lands in the world. Their disciples and elders would hold a competition from time to time. Through the competition, they’ve managed to filter out monstrous geniuses. Competition promotes improvement. Look at the Eastern Desolation; how many people can compete with you in regards to the sword?” The white-clothed swordsman asked, leaving Lin Yun speechless.

“Perhaps there’s also no one else who can compete with me there?” Lin Yun smiled.

“No one in the Eastern Desolation has grasped Astral Sword Intent, but that doesn’t mean no one in the Kunlun Realm hasn’t. Don’t underestimate the geniuses of a sword dao holy lands,” the white-clothed man shakes his head. “Back when the Sword Sect was still a holy land, they had plenty of geniuses, and their figures could be seen anywhere within the Eastern Desolation. Even the Heavenly Dao Sect felt pressured by the Sword Sect. But we’re fortunate because I barely became a Sword Emperor. Otherwise, the Sword Sect wouldn’t just be the strongest sword dao holy land, but the strongest holy land.”

Lin Yun smiled because this white-clothed man was pretty interesting. He praised the Sword Sect, which was indirectly praising him.

“You can imagine how powerful the Sword Sect was three thousand years ago and how powerful the other sword dao holy lands are now,” the white-clothed man said.

Lin Yun pondered and found sense in the white-clothed man’s words. Sword dao holy lands who have established their forces with the sword naturally had a strong foundation in the sword. As long as their inheritance wasn’t broken, they could nurture some geniuses with their foundation, even if no geniuses appeared amongst them.

“Each sword dao holy land has its own sword cannon inheritance, such as Sword Sect’s Great Profound Sword Canon. They’re called sword canons because they’re top-tiered dragon spirit martial techniques, and they can be considered heavenly spirit martial techniques,” the white-clothed man said. “This is why they’re so terrifying. As for talent in sword dao, I don’t think you’re any weaker than them.”

“Thank you for your reminder,” Lin Yun replied. It appeared that the Sword Assembly was more interesting than he had thought. The sword canon was terrifying, but it was a pity that the Sword Sect’s Great Profound Sword Canon wasn’t complete. Otherwise, it would be powerful.

Bidding farewell with the white-clothed man, Lin Yun returned to the Indigo Thunder Peak to rest since he had to leave tomorrow. Lin Yun sorted out all his trump cards, the Astral Sword Intent at greater mastery, and the two sword stars. If the sun and moon managed to fuse, the number of galaxies would definitely increase, reaching thirty-six.

An ordinary swordsman’s Astral Sword Intent reaching greater mastery might not have as many galaxies as him because the derivation of galaxies wasn’t easy.

Next would be Sword of the Beginning. Lin Yun didn’t stop practicing it, and he could now fully control it. He could use it as his trump card or split it into individual sword techniques. If he could find the nirvana imprint, the power of his sword technique might increase, but he couldn’t be anxious about that.

His third trump card would be the Azure Dragon Sword Heart. If he executed it with the Myriad Astral Celestial Art, it might even boost his strength.

Last would be the Divine Firefly Sword. He had reached the manifestation stage in the first section, and it could also be considered a trump card. With that, he concluded that he had four trump cards, the Astral Sword Intent, Sword of the Beginning, Azure Dragon Sword Heart, and Divine Firefly Sword.

“I’m still one stage away from complete mastery of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra,” Lin Yun muttered. “If I can have complete mastery before the Sword Assembly, it can also be considered a trump card.”

As for a sword canon, he might not have practiced the Great Profound Sword Canon, but he practiced the Iris Sword Saint’s Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, which was enough to confront those geniuses. Even the white-clothed man didn’t know all of Lin Yun’s trump cards.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he saw that an uninvited guest had appeared, Wang Muyan. He said, “You’re late.”

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised that Wang Muyan would come, but he was surprised she would find him now.

Wang Muyan frowned and furiously said, “What seal did you place on me?”

The seal tortured Wang Muyan during this period. Lin Yun had expected that Wang Muyan would look for him because of the Nether Shackles.

“Nether Shackles, using nether energy to seal the soul and physique. My Nether Shackles might not be able to reach the height of ancient emperors, but it’s more than enough to deal with you,” Lin Yun said.

“I knew it,” Wang Muyan muttered. “Ye Qingtian, I’m actually surprised. We’re not enemies, and we can even be considered friends. You’re not someone of the Heavenly Dao Sect, so perhaps we might have some common interests.”

“I won’t cooperate with you, so you can give up on that thought,” Lin Yun said.

If Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of the power sealed within Wang Muyan, he would’ve killed her back at Six Holy City. He might’ve spared her and made her swear the oath, but he naturally needed another means to keep her under control.

Wang Muyan smiled, “Ye Qingtian, there will be no changes within the Heavenly Dao Sect, even if you kill me. This is a huge cake, and you have no idea how many people are tempted by it.”

“You seem to know a lot,” Lin Yun said.

“I naturally know a lot,” Wang Muyan smiled. “But there’s no need to tell you about it. Don’t be too conceited because no one is certain about the future, and there will be a day when you will beg me.”

“We’ll see, then. We’ll talk about it when that happens,” Lin Yun replied.

“Ha, it’d be great if you could come back alive. I’m here because I’m afraid you’ll die at the Hidden Sword Manor, and no one else can undo the Nether Shackles,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“Wow, your words sound really nice,” Lin Yun replied.

Wang Muyan rolled her eyes and smiled, “Big Brother Ye, why don’t we change the method? How about this? If you help me undo the Nether Shackles, I’ll provide the resources you need to cultivate your sword intent.”

Wang Muyan came over to Lin Yun with an elegant fragrance coming from her. She softly said, “It’s hard to cultivate the Astral Sword Intent, and those beads aren’t enough to bring it to greater mastery. Those beads have huge side effects; other treasures can temper your sword intent.”

Lin Yun raised his head to look at Wang Muyan. He had to admit that Wang Muyan was skillful in guessing the thoughts of others.

“Those sword dao holy lands have a place and pellets to temper their sword intents. They can’t be found in the outside world, and there’s no way you can obtain them. But I can help you obtain them,” Wang Muyan said, sincerely looking at Lin Yun. Paired with her charming face, anyone besides Lin Yun would’ve agreed to her immediately.

“If your Astral Sword Intent reaches greater mastery, the resources you need will increase. With your talent in the sword dao, do you want to slow down your cultivation?” Wang Muyan said as she took out an exquisite golden box. When she opened it, it was a silver pellet with exquisite cloud runes engraved on the surface, and the pellet also released an enchanting fragrance.

The sun and moon sword stars within Lin Yun’s forehead sensed the pure sword intent within the pellet, and they became irritated along with a desire rising within Lin Yun’s heart. He forcibly calmed himself down and asked, “What’s that?”

Sword intent and other marital intents were also hard to cultivate. Any treasure that could temper the martial intent was extremely rare, and only holy lands had them, such as the Heavenly Cloud Fruits on the Celestial Purging Mountain.

This pellet was comparable to the Seven-Colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit, but the effects were purer, with a fatal attraction to sword intent. Lin Yun could sense that the effect of this pellet should be on the same level as Nine-Colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits, but there was a strong desire coming from his sword intent.

Wang Muyan closed the box and smiled, “The Great Solar Saint Pellet, forged by condensing the sun's flames into saint crystals, refined with eighteen saint fruits and nine bizarre flowers. It’s precious, and not many people know about the formula. Only top-tiered Heavenly Spiritualists can refine them. Aside from that, there’s also the Great Lunar Saint Pellet and other star pellets. All of them can temper your Astral Sword Intent.”

Seeing Lin Yun catching the bait, Wang Muyan smiled, “Even if you’re not a swordsman, there are endless benefits in refining those saint pellets. So why don’t you consider it?”

Lin Yun’s heart throbbed as he looked at Wang Muyan. He realised that he had underestimated her. He would have probably agreed to her request if he didn’t refine the three strands of flames. It appears that she came prepared.

“Everyone has their desire, and there can be a transaction as long as there’s a desire.” Wang Muyan played around with the golden box and smiled at Lin Yun.

“Even after I humiliated you in Six Holy City?” Lin Yun asked casually.

“Even if you make a move against me now, I can carry on my transaction with you as long as I’m still alive, as long as there are interests,” Wang Muyan revealed with a charming smile. “So humiliation is nothing as long as you can bring me interest.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and realized he had misunderstood Wang Muyan. In her opinion, it was no big deal, even if she was the mastermind behind the attacks in the Myriad Graves Valley. As long as Lin Yun was alive, everything could be discussed.

“You can leave. I won’t undo the Nether Shackles for you,” Lin Yun said.

“Haha. Big Brother Ye, are you sure about that? You know that the Nether Shackles can’t trap me for eternity, and you’ll have no chips to bargain with me then,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“Since I can put the Nether Shackles on you once, I can do it again,” Lin Yun replied as if he was saying something insignificant.

“Ye Qingtian!” Wang Muyan was finally furious. She had already taken a step back, but Ye Qingtian did not intend to take a step back as well. She had never seen such a stubborn person capable of withstanding her temptation. Wang Muyan furiously said, “Don’t regret it, then! I’ll see how you die at the Hidden Sword Manor!”

Wang Muyan left after venting her anger.

Lin Yun said, “You can leave, but leave the pellet behind.”

“You!” Wang Muyan was on the verge of going insane as she said, “Ye Qingtian, don’t push it. Do you want to snatch the Great Solar Saint Pellet? Dream on!”

Wang Muyan was genuinely furious now. Not only did Ye Qingtian not agree with her terms, he even wanted to snatch the Great Solar Saint Pellet from her.

“I only want to research it, not snatch it away. I’ll return it to you once I’m done studying it.” Lin Yun took a step forth and seized the box from Wang Muyan without her agreeing to it.

When Lin Yun sat back down, it was as though nothing had happened. This shocked Wang Muyan because she could only see a blur, and the Great Solar Saint Pellet had disappeared from her hand.

“Ye Qingtian!” Wang Muyan was on the verge of going insane, nearly losing her rationale.

But Wang Muyan calmed down when Lin Yun glanced at her. She felt that there were countless swords in front of her, and she would die if she stepped forward. This shocked Wang Muyan because Ye Qingtian’s improvement was too fast.

“You’re still not leaving?” Lin Yun asked.

Wang Muyan was trembling from anger as she looked at the golden box with grievances filling her pupils. At this moment, Ye Qingtian was no different from a devil in her eyes. Not only did Ye Qingtian seize the Great Solar Saint Pellet, she also couldn’t stand the contempt within Ye Qingtian’s pupils when he looked at her.

“Ye Qingtian, just wait! This isn’t over yet!” Wang Muyan furiously left.
