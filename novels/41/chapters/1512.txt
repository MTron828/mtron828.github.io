Chapter 1513 - Secrets of the Nine Emperors Rise in Power

As they pushed forth, the seven chief disciples cleared a path with their rune saint artifacts. One had to admit that the power of the myriad rune saint artifact was terrifying, especially the divine runes, even if they weren’t natural divine runes.

Under normal circumstances, only Dragon Pulse Realm experts could control those dragon runes, but the strength of the seven chief disciples had reached a terrifying height. So this meant that they possessed the power to wield those saint artifacts.

Four hours later, only a hundred-odd people managed to run out of the grey fog and arrive before the Blue Dragon Palace. The losses were huge, since they nearly had a thousand people before entering the grey mist.

Standing before the Blue Dragon Palace, everyone was filled with lingering fear. They still hadn’t come to their senses that there was an Ancient Demonspirit Corpse in the grey fog. This was something that no one had thought of. After all, the Demonspirit Clan was a fiend clan that appeared in the darkest period, and it wasn’t an exaggeration to call them mortal enemies of the Divine Dragon Era.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At this point, many people could guess that the destruction of the Golden Era was connected to the Demonspirit Clan.

“There’s actually an Ancient Demonspirit Corpse! This Dragon Remnant Astral Realm is really weird!”

“This astral realm isn’t simple. We can practically be sure that this is the legendary Blue Dragon Palace.”

“Blue Dragons are the rarest divine dragons amongst the seven divine dragons, and I’ve heard that no one possesses the Blue Dragon Bloodline in the current Divine Dragon Empire.”

“After this time, this astral realm will definitely be sealed off by the Divine Dragon Empire.”

“But we’re not without any harvest!” Everyone came to their senses and looked at the Blue Dragon Palace before them. The eyes of the chief disciples were heated as they looked at the palace.

“It is said that the Nine Emperors had risen to power because they received the inheritance of the Dragon Gate!” Ling Qianye said as he stared at the gate. This history was hidden; not even disciples of some powerful sects could know that. But it was easy for cultivators of the demonic sects to come in contact with that information.

“I wonder if there are any inheritances left behind in this Blue Dragon Palace.”

“Don’t overthink it. The secrets of the Nine Emperors are considered taboo in this Divine Dragon Era. It’s only speculation that it’s related to the Dragon Gate. But even if this Blue Dragon Palace is a branch palace, it’s an opportunity for us.”

“This palace has nine levels. I wonder how far I can reach.”

“Why care about that? There must be a Divine Dragon Bone in there!” The chief disciples wer chatting as they walked towards the gate, with everyone opening a path. No one naturally dared to enter before the seven chief disciples, even if there were treasures in there.

“You’re actually alive? You’re fortunate!” Tian Jue coldly smiled when he walked past Lin Yun.

“That’s none of your concern.” Lin Yun fearlessly said as he looked Tian Jue straight in the eyes. Since the Blue Dragon Palace was ahead of him, he did not need to put on an act before Tian Jue any longer.

“What’s with that attitude? How dare you speak to Big Brother Tian Jue in that manner!” The second envoy unleashed his killing intent and coldly looked at Lin Yun.

“Don’t bother with him. The Blue Dragon Palace is of utmost priority.” Tian Jue snorted. They could only stay in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm for another seven days before being sent out. So Tian Jue couldn’t be bothered with Lin Yun for now. He’d have plenty of opportunities to deal with Lin Yun after they left the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.

When the seven chief disciples entered the Blue Dragon Palace with the core disciples of the various demonic sects, Lin Yun followed the crowd into the palace. Passing through the gate, strands of pure dragon aura entered everyone’s bodies, and they all closed their eyes to refine those strands of dragon aura.

When Lin Yun reopened his eyes, a light flashed through his pupils, and he was definitely sure there was a Divine Dragon Bone in the palace. As he was basking in the warmth, he could sense that his vitality had recovered, and it had even become stronger than before.

Looking around, he noticed that Xiao Yun and An Liuyan had already disappeared. Lin Yun was the only one left behind. This meant that they were probably teleported elsewhere.

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because he wasn’t unfamiliar with this. Palaces with inheritances would usually leave behind a similar trial. This meant that one would have to make it through the trial if one wanted to obtain the treasures in the palace, which was different from the White Dragon Palace.

He suddenly came to his senses and knew this wasn’t a nirvana node. The Blue Dragon Palace genuinely existed in this era, and the scale of this Blue Dragon Palace was smaller than the White Dragon Palace. This meant that they might be from different periods.

“Empress, what are the attributes of the Divine Blue Dragon Bone? Is it compatible with me?” Lin Yun asked, recollecting his thoughts.

“The Divine Blue Dragon Bone is of wood attributes, but wood can also give birth to wind and control lightning. There’s no question that it’s definitely stronger than the Azure Dragon True Bone. The wood attribute can nourish your physique, and Divine Dragon Bones are at a level higher than True Dragon Bones.” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded. “Now, it depends if it has a natural divine rune. After all, the Azure Dragon True Bone possesses a natural divine rune!”

“I hope so.” Lin Yun didn’t force it. He would be satisfied if he could obtain a Divine Dragon Bone to complete his Azure Dragon Saint Art.

An hour later, a ripple spread out in the surroundings. When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see countless blue lights hovering in the air, and it didn’t take long for them to condense into a person. This alarmed Lin Yun when that person was formed. This person was donned in azure clothes and had a powerful firmament sword intent radiating from his pupils.

Before Lin Yun could respond, the Lin Yun clone had already thrust with his sword. As sword rays flew over, they left behind fluctuations in the air.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes, and defended himself with the Flower Burial Sword. When the sword ray brushed past his cheeks it sliced off several strands of hair, which was a close call. It might be easy for Lin Yun to fend off that attack, but it would be another story for others. After all, the firmament sword intent at complete mastery could easily heavily injure someone with one sword.

Everything suddenly became dark. When the disciples of the various demonic sects opened their eyes again, they realized they were sent out of the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, and the seven demonic sects’ camp was in the surroundings.

When everyone came to their senses, it was like they had had a long dream. They risked their lives to make it to the Blue Dragon Palace, but were sent out before they could continue.

“They’re out!”

“What’s the situation in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm?”

“How many saint elixirs did you all obtain?” The elders of the various demonic sects quickly went out and grabbed their sects’ disciples. After knowing the situation in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, everyone was shocked. When they heard about the Ancient Demonspirit Corpse and the Blue Dragon Palace, not even the Samsara Edict Realm elders could maintain their composure.

“Blue Dragon Palace? How is this possible… this is clearly a barren astral realm.”

“Divine Dragon Bone, we must get the Divine Dragon Bone!”

“The Divine Dragon Bone in there must contain a huge secret!” The Samsara Edict Realm elders finally lost their composer and even hoped they could enter the astral realm.

Lin Yun spent some time in the Blue Dragon Palace before he made it through the first trial. When his clone disappeared before him, he was surprised, “It’s gone just like that?”

Nothing has been left behind aside from a bronze gate. Does this mean that I am qualified to enter the palace? Lin Yun inwardly muttered. The difficulty of this trial wasn’t particularly tough. He just had to fend off ten swords, which was possible for everyone who came in. It might be easy for some, but some people would have to pay some price.

“Let’s go in and take a look.” Lin Yun pushed open the gates and entered the first level of the Blue Dragon Palace. The construction of the palace was complicated, and Lin Yun noticed that many rooms were swept by many people with nothing left behind.

But he wasn’t in a hurry because those who were ahead of him might not last till the end. When he saw the passage at the far end of the corridor, he could hear clamors, and he didn’t hesitate to walk in. When he entered, it was a brightly lit palace with ancient gemstones embedded on the roof that lit up the entire palace.

Aside from the path he used, there were a few more corridors that led to the palace. The construct disappointed Lin Yun because he felt that this palace shouldn’t have any secrets. At the very least, this palace shouldn’t be related to the Nine Emperors’ rise in power.

This palace should’ve been meant for the young disciples of the Blue Dragon Clan’s lineage. So there shouldn’t be other inheritances here aside from the trial. This meant that the biggest secret of the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm should be the nirvana node back in the cave.

But it was too dangerous. He could only brushed the tip of the iceberg, even if he had searched that region. That White Dragon Palace was massive, and this Blue Dragon Palace couldn’t even be called a palace of the divine dragon clans.

At the center of the palace was a blue stage with a shining stone box covered with all sorts of restrictions. In the palace, there were ten-odd demonic sect disciples and guests gathered there, and their eyes were blazing with flames.

“The restriction on the stone box seems to be fading!”

“I wonder what it contains inside. For it to be placed here, it should be more precious than the saint elixirs outside.”

“Why think so much? Just focus on snatching it later.” Everyone there muttered amongst themselves, and their eyes were filled with anticipation. They also knew there would be a chaotic battle here in just a moment.
