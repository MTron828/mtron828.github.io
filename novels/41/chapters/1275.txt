Chapter 1276 - Gathering of Geniuses (1)

Everyone fell into a dead silence after seeing Feng Jue kill the eight elders with just half an inch of sword ray, not to mention that the sword ray even tore the night apart. Aside from the eight Dragon Pulse Realm elders, none of the deacons or disciples were harmed and they could only feel a gentle breeze blowing past them.

But this only made it even more terrifying because this meant that Feng Jue could control his attack as he wished. They instantly figured out that Feng Jue was at the Samsara Edict Realm, and all the Empyreans on the island were dumbfounded while looking at Feng Jue with disbelief.

They were deeply shocked that Lin Yun had a Samsara Edict Realm expert behind him. At the same time, they now knew why Lin Yun was so fearless when facing the eight elders. With a Samsara Edict Realm expert behind him, the eight sects were nothing!

But no one could maintain their composure. Everyone knew that there were Samsara Edict Realm experts hidden in the dark, protecting the transcendent geniuses of the various sects. Those geniuses who received their protection were all ranked within the top ten on the Empyrean Ranking. Not only were they incredibly strong, but they were also blessed with heaven-defying fortune. They were the hope of their respective sects.

Even if they reached the Elysium Core Realm, they would also shine on the Elysium Core Ranking sooner or later. But they couldn’t figure out who Lin Yun was for him to need a Samsara Edict Realm expert to protect him. This was simply too unbelievable.

“Feng Jue!” The remaining deacons of the eight sects instantly recognized Feng Jue and their faces instantly became ugly.

They furiously came, wanting to take Lin Yun’s life, but they never expected that Feng Jue would be standing behind Lin Yun. After all, Feng Jue was the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, one of the three Sword Saints in the Eastern Desolation!

Let’s not mention that the eight big sects were the ones to make a move against Lin Yun first, but even if Feng Jue was the one to make the first move, the big sects also wouldn’t dare to utter a single word. Just when everyone was feeling uneasy, light began to appear in the sky, manifesting into eight figures that hovered above the island.

They were all Samsara Edict Realm experts, and this made everyone’s faces change. After all, didn’t this mean that the Samsara Edict Realm experts of the eight big sects were here? Could it be that this would turn into a war?

The appearance of the eight Samsara Edict Realm experts instantly made everyone uneasy and wondered if they should escape. After all, they could only be cannon-fodder before experts of this level. Even when Lin Yun saw this formation, his face also couldn’t help changing, and wondered if his senior brother could withstand the rage of eight Samsara Edict Realm experts.

But he sneaked a peek and noticed that not only was Feng Jue unafraid, he was even looking at the eight of them with a playful gaze.

“Feng Jue, I believe this is a misunderstanding. We had no idea that this Lin Yun is someone you’re protecting.”

“Why don’t we stop this matter here?”

“They deserved to die to know no shame when acting against a junior.”

“We’ll restrict the elders of our sects when we return.”

“I’m sorry about that, young lad. The Azure Thunder Sect apologizes for our mistake.” Just when all the Empyreans on the island were feeling uneasy, each Samsara Edict Realm expert from the big sects spoke and gave a lump of light to Lin Yun.

This scene made all the Empyreans dumbfounded with the corner of their lips twitching. They couldn’t imagine that the arrogant big sects would actually apologize. This wasn’t what they had imagined in the first place.

“Let's end it here, then,” smiled Feng Jue.

“Let’s go.” Seeing that Feng Jue wasn’t going to pursue this matter any longer, the Samsara Edict Realm expert of the Flame Dragon Sect was the first to leave. As flames burst out around him, the flames swiftly manifested into a dragon that swept up the deacons and disciples of his sect before leaving.

The other Samsara Edict Realm experts also quickly left with the members of their sects. At this moment, only then did everyone recover from their shock and realized that they were here to pick up the members of their sects, and it was no wonder that they were so polite. Could it be that this Feng Jue was really that strong?

“Who is he?”

“Didn’t you hear what that deacon said? That’s Feng Jue, the disciple of Radiant Sword Saint!”

“Radiant Sword Saint? Isn’t that one of the three Sword Saints in the Eastern Desolation?”

“Who else aside from him?” The entire island exploded into an uproar. Lin Yun actually had connections with the Radiant Sword Saint, and this made it a little too terrifying. After all, some people have been saying that Lin Yun was not someone as simple as a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and it appeared that they were right.

Lin Yun was happy as he looked at the gifts before him. He had a feeling that these would be worth at least a few hundred thousand divine astral pellets. But just when he was about to reach out to them, they were all swept away by Feng Jue before he could even react.

When he unhappily turned to look at Feng Jue, Feng Jue smiled. “The fee for my help. It’ll be the same price next time, too.”

“You’re really stingy.” Lin Yun emotionlessly said.

But Feng Jue wasn’t bothered by that. His gaze was attracted to Gongsun Yan, instead. “What’s going on with this brother? Why is he trembling ever since I showed up? Is this your first time seeing an expert in the Samsara Edict Realm? Haha, there’s no need for you to be so excited!”

“He’s a disciple of the Skysolute City, self-proclaimed ‘possesser the dignity of the Sword Emperor’,” said Zhao Yan.

“The Sword Emperor’s lineage?” Feng Jue dropped his smile and his expression became grave, but this only made Gongsun Yan tremble even more violently. He even glared at Zhao Yan and had no idea how to explain himself right now.

Previously, Lin Yun didn’t know about the feud between the Sword Emperor and Sword Sect, but he knew about it now. Three thousand years ago, Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng destroyed two of the nine peaks belonging to the Sword Sect. From then on, the Sword Sect only had seven peaks left, causing their position as a holy land to fall. This was a great humiliation to them, and it was all thanks to the Radiant Sword Saint that they could maintain themselves until now or their current situation would’ve been even worse.

Although the Sword Sect’s name was still resounding as the strongest sword-related sect in the Ancient Barren Domain, there was no way it could be comparable to a holy land. So the feud between the Sword Emperor and the Sword Sect was pretty obvious.
