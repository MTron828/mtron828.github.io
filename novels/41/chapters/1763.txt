Chapter 1764 – Divine Azure Overlord Physique

“Interesting…” Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Physique and poured the dragon runes into his arms before exerting force. The cap wasn’t popped off, but runes began to appear on the surface of the jade bottle, and they were all ancient saint runes.

The next moment, a dragon roar suddenly echoed from within it, and the jade bottle turned into a giant bottle that was nearly ten meters high, shocking Lin Yun.

“It’s actually a spatial bottle.” Lin Yun was surprised.

Mu Xueling gently floated over and examined the runes on the bottle. She said, “This isn’t just a spatial bottle. This should be the Lotus Treasure Bottle the Buddhist Cult uses to store Buddha’s blood.

“The space within is much bigger than it looks outside, and it’s not easy to open the bottle.” Mu Xueling observed the bottle for a long time before nodding her head. “Use your mental energy to refine the vase first, then I’ll teach you the runes that are on it.”

Half a stick of incense later, Lin Yun had successfully refined the Lotus Treasure Bottle, and the bottle returned to palm size. When the cap popped off, it started trembling like the snowy mountain that was about to collapse.

Shortly after, nine lotuses in the form of white clouds flew out from the bottle and entered Lin Yun’s body. Lin Yun’s face slightly changed, and he became nervous.

Seeing this, Mu Xueling’s pupils shone, and she said, “Don’t be nervous. This is the Divine Azure Aura, which can be considered a spiritual energy that comes with the Divine Azure Blood. Ordinary people can experience a great boost in cultivation just by absorbing a wisp of it, so you can try it.”

Lin Yun was skeptical but closed his eyes and circulated his cultivation technique before taking a deep breath.

As wisps of the Divine Azure Aura entered his body, they immediately formed into a river of saint aura that gathered in his dragon origin ocean before coursing throughout his meridians. It took him two full days to refine the nine wisps of Divine Azure Aura.

“How is it?” Mu Xueling asked.

“Weird. My cultivation didn’t increase, but each dragon pulse has been greatly nourished, reaching a height of more than a thousand feet. It feels amazing.” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked. He only knew he could start and temper his dragon pulses after his cultivation reached the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

Take his Senior Brother Jian Jingtian, for example. His dragon pulses reached tens of thousands of feet, and as long as he was around, no one could rise to the top of the Dragon Pulse Ranking. But Jian Jingtian was a genius, and his accomplishments couldn’t be replicated, not even by Lin Yun.

Jian Jingtian was trapped at the Dragon Pulse Realm for decades, and his dragon pulses had grown so much that they became a burden to him. If he couldn’t make a breakthrough to the Samsara Edict Realm, he would’ve been killed by his dragon pulses sooner or later.

For a genius like Lin Yun, he wouldn’t be stuck in the Dragon Pulse Realm for so long, and there was no need for that.

“That was just the spiritual energy that came with the Divine Azure Blood. But Lin Yun, you possess many treasures, to begin with. If the news of you possessing the Divine Azure Blood gets out, the number of people coming for your life will far exceed your imagination.” Mu Xueling calmly said.

“Even without these treasures, many people are still after my life. I have the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, Firmament Saint Cloth, Profound Wither Key, and the Blue Dragon Bone. One is enough to drive a Samsara Edict Realm expert insane for my life.” Lin Yun said. “The enemies that I have to face are so powerful that it’s suffocating, but I don’t have any other path aside from becoming stronger.”

Mu Xueling inwardly praised him, but said, “That’s right. Everyone in the Divine Dragon Era is like a dragon; they only pursue their dreams, not longevity. Without pressure, you can’t become a true dragon and compete with the holy lands’ geniuses to leave your name on the Blue Dragon Record.”

The Blue Dragon Record? Lin Yun’s heart skipped a beat; this was the first time he heard Mu Xueling mentioning it. But he didn’t think much about it because he had already guessed that Mu Xueling had some sort of connection with the Blue Dragon Record. Since Mu Xueling didn’t say anything more about it, he naturally wouldn’t ask.

“What’s the length of the dragon pulses for those in the top ten on the Dragon Pulse Ranking?” Lin Yun asked.

“Those in the top ten are at least three thousand feet, but I don’t know the specifics. They will definitely hide their strength.” Mu Xueling said.

That was as expected of the top ten on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, and they couldn’t be underestimated. Lin Yun whispered, “But they seem a little far behind when compared to my senior brother…”

“You’re talking about Jian Jingtian?” Mu Xueling asked. “He’s a special case, and he’s blessed by fortune, to begin with. If he hadn’t fallen for Tian Xuanzi’s trap, he would’ve been a Quasi-Saint or a Saint by now.”

“Isn’t that an exaggeration? Eighteen years from the Dragon Pulse Realm to Saint Realm?” Lin Yun exclaimed. He really didn’t expect his senior brother to be so terrifying.

“Otherwise, how could he suppress all of the geniuses in the Ancient Barren Domain? He suppressed even the geniuses of the Eastern Desolation’s holy lands to the point that their holy sons didn’t even dare to leave the holy lands. Many people felt the Sword Sect would become a holy land when he grew up.” Mu Xueling said after a brief pondering.

“It’s no wonder why Tian Xuanzi is so ruthless…” Lin Yun murmured.

“But it’s not easy to become a Saint from Quasi-Saint.” Mu Xueling continued.

“Speaking of which. Saint Elder, you’re about to become a Saint, right?” Lin Yun recalled that Mu Xueling seemed to be at the Quasi-Saint Realm.

“It’s not that easy. It might only be one step, but this step is even more difficult than climbing the sky. This step is also most prone to cause problems because if there’s even a slight mistake, all my effort will go down the drain.” Mu Xueling explained. “Everyone beneath the Saint Realm are mere ants, and the Saint Realm is the true beginning. You’ll know how difficult it is to take that step in the future.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered, then he said, “How do I refine the Divine Azure Blood, then?”

“There might only seem to be a drop of the Divine Azure Blood, but there’s something special about this jade bottle. It won’t be that easy for you to refine it.” Mu Xueling said. “The Divine Azure Overlord Physique will need the Divine Azure Blood to cultivate it, so look at this first.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun took the jade slip and placed it against his forehead. When he was done, his expression changed and became uncertain. When he turned to look at Mu Xueling, the latter was calm, as though she had already foreseen this.

“You already knew?” Lin Yun couldn’t help asking.

“Yeah. It’s recorded in the books.” Mu Xueling replied. Her reply was just as Lin Yun had expected.

Holding onto the jade slip, Lin Yun began to pace back and forth with uncertainty. The Divine Azure Overlord Physique was a godly body-refining technique; he could even become a deity by relying on his physique. It was even more terrifying than the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art. But he must disperse his existing body-refining cultivation to practice this body-refining technique. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He had to disperse the Azure Dragon Saint Art and Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art. This meant he would lose all hundred thousand dragon runes and all the foundation of his physique, but he would undergo a transformation by dissolving it. But he wasn’t sure if he could grasp the transformation because the Divine Azure Overlord Physique was too tough, and he wasn’t confident he could practice it.

He already had a strong physique, and the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art wasn’t weak. He had spent a great price to get to where he was now. Placing the jade slip aside, Lin Yun looked at the monument and asked, “What about the Azure Dragon’s Soul, then?”

“It can be injected into the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, your sword, or your hundred thousand dragon runes. Then again, if you choose to disperse your current body-refining cultivation, you can only pick the first two choices.” Mu Xueling said.

Lin Yun fell into silence and picked up the last jade slip. This was a small gift. But despite being a small gift, it was a ghost spirit martial technique. Dragon Clan’s martial techniques were extraordinary, and the Dragon Clan’s sword technique was the strongest amongst those of the same grade.

Placing the jade slip against his forehead, boundless information started pouring into his mind, and he could see multiple people performing a different sword technique. But each move was so terrifying that it could tear space apart as a dragon roar echoed across the horizon. Every sword would manifest a different part of the Azure Dragon, the dragon claw, tail, scales, or head. The concept of each sword was different, but they were highly profound.

This sword technique was called the Azure Dragon Sword Art, with the profundity of thunderstorms as the foundation, and Azure Dragon itself was the true concept of this sword. The sword moves might represent different parts of the Azure Dragon but were also one.

The golden human within Lin Yun’s sword ocean began to practice this sword technique, and even his Sword Heart was immersed in it. Perhaps because of Lin Yun’s talent in sword dao, he easily mastered the first sword.

Lowering his hand, he drew the Flower Burial Sword and dashed forth like a bolt of lightning, flying past Mu Xueling. His sword was like a dragon claw, tearing the space before him apart. When he flicked his wrist, the sword rays would overlap, and dragon claws began to descend from the sky like mountains.

The next moment, he returned to his original spot and sheathed the Flower Burial Sword. Stowing the sword, Lin Yun muttered, “This sword technique is pretty suitable for me. It might not be as good as the Divine Firefly Sword, but it has its own unique characteristics and is on the same level as the Carefree 9 Swords.”

The Divine Firefly Sword was too complicated, and he only knew one sword. Thus, he could only use it as a trump card. If he fought under the moniker of Lin Xiao, it would be inconvenient because he couldn’t use the Carefree 9 Swords, and he no longer had to worry about that with the Azure Dragon Sword Art.

He wasn’t in a hurry to practice it because this sword technique wasn’t as challenging as the Divine Firefly Sword. As long as he spent some time on it, he could easily reach perfection, and this was his confidence.

While he fell into deep thoughts, a series of sounds interrupted his trail of thoughts. He saw Mu Xueling knocking on the table with the jade slip that recorded the Divine Azure Overlord Physique and said, “I can help you when you want to disperse your body-refining cultivation.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched, and he asked, “Saint Elder, you’re not afraid that you’ll fail to disperse my body-refining cultivation? Even if you’ve succeeded, I might not succeed in the Divine Azure Overlord Physique.”

Mu Xueling didn’t say a word, but simply tapped the jade slip on the table. Meanwhile, Lin Yun fell into deep thought and couldn’t decide.

Looking at Lin Yun, Mu Xueling couldn’t help smiling, “Why are you acting like a child? You know you don’t have a choice, so why are you struggling to make one? Are you afraid of pain?”

Lin Yun raised his head and was stumped, looking at Mu Xueling. The Mu Xueling was cold like an iceberg, but was really breathtaking when she smiled.
