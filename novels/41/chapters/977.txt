Chapter 978 - Dao Artifact’s Might!

The crowd sucked in a cold breath at the sea of flames because they could feel the immense pressure. They couldn’t help feeling terrified by the sea of flames.

Of course, they knew that Feng Xuanyi wouldn’t just roll over and die, but they never expected Feng Xuanyi to be so strong. The pressure alone was enough to make anyone feel despair.

“What power!” Lin Yun’s face became grave as sword intent flashed in the depths of his pupils. He was understanding the troublesome nature of Feng Xuanyi’s flame intent that was almost in the third grade. The grades of martial intent were important, but they weren’t as important as one’s attainment. For example, Lin Yun could use his greater spiritual sword intent to suppress other opponents on the same level.

Feng Xuanyi’s attainment in the flame intent wasn't any weaker than Lin Yun’s sword intent. Meanwhile, he grasped a monarch fortune martial technique, refined many divine astral pellets, and a high grade cultivation technique. Lin Yun’s only real advantage was the fact that he only used divine astral pellets since reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm.

As for Feng Xuanyi, he probably started refining divine astral pellets only after reaching the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm. There was no way that Feng Xuanyi’s foundation could compare to Lin Yun’s foundation. On top of all this, Lin Yun’s fighting prowess was comparable to Feng Xuanyi. Granted, Lin Yun had Lil’ Red to help him.

At this point in the fight, they were waiting to see who would use their trump card first.

“Is this the best you have, Flower Burial? Aren’t you a little too shameless to seek help from your pet?” Feng Xuanyi looked at Lil’ Red who was on Lin Yun’s shoulder. Although he was showing a strong front, his condition wasn’t very good. Lil’ Red’s Void Blade and Lin Yun’s Divine Glorysun Fist, were enough to kill a normal person several times over. So even though Feng Xuanyi was alive, he was still heavily injured.

What Feng Xuanyi relied on to survive was a stronger foundation than most geniuses at his cultivation level. He also had many trump cards left, but it would be great if he didn’t have to reveal them. After all, one would never know what trump cards their opponent had. At the very least, Feng Xuanyi could feel that Lin Yun had two more trump cards hidden, which wasn’t easy to deal with.

Furthermore, Lin Yun had a pet assisting him in the fight. If he engaged Lin Yun in a one-on-one fight, he was confident that he could easily suppress Lin Yun. It was the addition of Lil’ Red that gave him a headache.

With a playful smile, Lin Yun replied, “Sorry, but you must be mistaken. This isn’t my pet, it’s my brother. We rarely work together to face someone together, so you can consider this your honor!”

Lil’ Red usually wouldn’t team up with Lin Yun, but Lil’ Red also wouldn’t let Lin Yun die. After all, Lil’ Red made a promise with Yue Weiwei.

As Lin Yun and Feng Xuanyi conversed, Lil’ Red held onto the Void Blade with one hand and made a fist with the other. Lil’ Red’s black pupils were firm as it pushed its aura to the limit to resist Feng Xuanyi’s aura.

“ I really have to thank you then!” Feng Xuanyi gnashed his teeth with a dark face. Lin Yun and Lil’ Red were troublesome to deal with, but there was no way he could give up on the Glorysun Constellation Palace’s inheritance. So he would take a look at Lin Yun’s other trump cards.

“Profound Flame Art—Flame Phoenix Battle Armor!” Feng Xuanyi formed his seals incredibly fast as a crimson light covered his body. He quickly manifested a crimson armor engraved with phoenix runes while flames grew violently around him.

“A secret technique!” Lin Yun squinted his eyes because such secret techniques could only be found in advanced fortune martial techniques. Feng Xuanyi was playing a pretty impressive trump card.

“Kill!” The flames around Feng Xuanyi manifested into a massive blazing phoenix as he charged at Lin Yun with flames. At this moment, Lin Yun looked tiny.

As for the spectators, their hearts were jumping out of their chest because the pressure of the phoenix incinerated all the clouds in the sky. Without the demonic clouds covering the sky, starlight was able to shine on the phoenix, which made it look majestic.

However, the moment that the crowd thought that Lin Yun would face trouble, a dragon made of purple lightning roared at the phoenix. Lin Yun’s transcendent dao artifact, the Indigoflame Thunderwhip, was being unleashed.

This dao artifact had an ancient origin and was subdued by Yue Weiwei for him. But even though Lin Yun was stronger now, he could barely unleash one-tenth of its might. Surprisingly, one-tenth of its might was enough to suppress the flame phoenix’s pressure.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun locked his brows together. He looked like a lightning emperor as he controlled the lightning dragon. Along with an explosion, the flame phoenix was torn into pieces as Feng Xuanyi went flying.

“You want to see my trump cards? As you wish!” Lin Yun started pouring his strength into the Indigoflame Thunderwhip, causing the lightning dragon to grow while horns protrude from its head. With a flick of the wrist, the whip flew towards Feng Xuanyi once again. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Myriad Crows Star Shattering Fist!” Feng Xuanyi’s face changed as he punched the lightning dragon. Although he managed to stop the dragon, the sheer impact sent him flying. Before he could regain his footing, Lil’ Red was already charging over with a whip of his own.

“This damned cat!” Feng Xuanyi was enraged. Not only was Lin Yun bullying him with a transcendent dao artifact, but Lil’ Red was bullying him as well? Without any hesitation, Feng Xuanyi pushed his palm out, which crushed Lil’ Red’s attack.

“Hehe.” Lil’ Red grinned and retaliated, moving with great agility. However, Feng Xuanyi did the same, dodging Lil’ Red’s attacks and countering with his own.

“Die!” Feng Xuanyi got close to Lil’ Red with the claw of a flame phoenix. Once again, the Indigoflame Thunderwhip lashed him, causing the Flame Phoenix Battle Armor’s luster to dim down. The impact made Feng Xuanyi throw up another mouthful of blood, but he didn’t give up. I almost have that damnable cat!

At this moment, Lil’ Red left behind an afterimage in mid-air. When it reappeared, it had a dagger in its hand that was aimed at Feng Xuanyi’s chest. Successfully hitting the target, Lil’ Red fled. After all, it nearly died earlier because it couldn’t run away in time.

In the next second, Feng Xuanyi’s armor shattered and the pieces manifested into flaming tornadoes. The spectators were surprised that Feng Xuanyi’s Flame Phoenix Battle Armor broke. There were even tears on his clothes.

“Lin Yun, just you wait! If I don’t get revenge, my name isn’t Feng Xuanyi! You better not show your face when the Azure Dragon Palace appears or else I’ll make you suffer!” Feng Xuanyi’s face was pale. He knew that it wouldn’t be easy for him to beat Lin Yun and Lil’ Red without using his trump cards.

Moreover, it would be troublesome if he lost control of his temper because of Lil’ Red. So he could only choose to give up for the time being.

Unbelievably, Feng Xuanyi ran away from Lin Yun. Did Lin Yun just win?
