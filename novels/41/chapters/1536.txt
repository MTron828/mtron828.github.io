Chapter 1537 - Heavenly Moon

Just how powerful was a King at full power? The power was indescribable and it exploded from Jin Jue’s body. That aura instantly manifested into dense black clouds. The clouds caught up with Lil’ Purple in the blink of an eye.

As Lin Yun rode on Lil’ Purple’s back, he could sense an extremely dangerous aura. When he turned around, he saw the black clouds that looked like primordial beasts. At this moment, he finally knew why Lil’ Purple would revert to her actual body. This was because he would be caught by Jin Jue with his usual speed, even if Jin Jue was injured.

Jin Jue had no emotion on his face as he tossed a pellet into his mouth before he chased after Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple. His speed was too fast, and he was like a comet streaking across the horizon.

“Empress, faster!” Lin Yun became anxious because his senior brother wasn’t in a good state.

“Junior brother, am I going to die soon…?” Feng Jue asked weakly.

“Senior Brother, don’t speak. We’ll reach the Sword Sect soon. I believe that Master will save you!” Lin Yun gave Feng Jue a Profound Wither Pellet before pouring astral energy into his body, helping him to refine that pellet.

The Profound Wither Pellet was a precious high-grade saint pellet, and Lin Yun could recover from any injury as long as he was alive. But it didn’t affect Feng Jue much because his injuries were too heavy. This meant that Feng Jue was probably heavily injured when he previously fought Jin Jue, not to mention that he was bound by a fishing line and used as a fishing bait to humiliate.

He took several attacks from Jin Jue after that, especially the last attack, which pierced through his chest. That attack nearly destroyed all his internal organs, and anyone else in his position would already be dead.

“Junior Brother, put me down and return by yourself. You can’t die. Fifth Junior Brother is already trapped in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. If you’re gone, the Sword Sect will really be doomed.” Feng Jue tightly held onto Lin Yun’s hand with a grave expression.

“You won’t die. You saved my life back then. So I will live well.” Lin Yun comforted.

“It’s a pity that this senior brother of yours is useless… I’m the stupidest amongst our master’s disciples and have embarrassed him.” Feng Jue’s pupils flickered with guilt. But the one thing that comforted him was that he brought Lin Yun to the Kunlun Realm.

“Lin Yun, how dare you play tricks!” Jin Jue’s voice echoed as he closed the distance with them, radiating a terrifying power.

Profound Sky Canon—Profound Dragon Sword!

As Jin Jue radiated brightly, a sword ray flew along his outstretched finger. The sword ray instantly became several hundred feet in size. The sword ray swiftly flew and caught up to the ice phoenix. Although Lil’ Purple managed to dodge in time, the sword ray affected the surrounding air current, significantly obstructing her speed.

But Jin Jue didn’t stop there and unleashed several sword rays. Each sword ray was so terrifying that they radiated brightly like crystals. This scene shocked Lin Yun because he knew that just the aftermath of the sword rays was enough to take his life.

Lil’ Purple’s figure flashed here and there, but her flight was still stable despite her speed being greatly hindered. This made Jin Jue’s face dark. As a decisive light shimmered across his pupils, a painting unfolded behind him.

He knew that the commotion of him summoning his constellation would be great. When his constellation unfolded, a flaming demonic eagle appeared. This was a demonic beast that possessed the bloodline of golden crows, the Gold Flame Demonic Eagle.

It had a pair of sharp eyes that looked like blazing suns. As its feathers emitted a blazing radiance, each of the feathers looked like a sharp divine weapon. When Jin Jue stood on the Gold Flame Demonic Eagle, his aura reached a whole new height.

As the Gold Flame Demonic Eagle spread its wings, its feathers were enveloped with flames before shooting towards Lil’ Purple. This made Lin Yun furrow his brows as he waved his hand and retrieved the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. Looking down at the umbrella, Lin Yun muttered, “Screw it.”

Pouring twenty thousand dragon runes into the umbrella, Lin Yun’s forehead was soon covered in sweat, sensing a huge hindrance. He wasn’t trying to open an umbrella, but lifting a mountain.

Circulating the Azure Dragon Saint Art, Lin Yun poured the dragon runes into the umbrella from the Blue Dragon Bone. When the exhaustion of his vitality reached a limit, he raised the umbrella in his hand to the sky. When he raised his head, he saw that the sky was raining blood, as if it was trying to incinerate the entire world.

“Open!” Lin Yun roared, and he opened the umbrella. When the umbrella was opened, a terrifying light exploded from Lin Yun, forming a semi-circle energy barrier. When the blood landed on the umbrella, it created a metallic collision with sparks flying around. At this moment, it was as though he was supporting the entire sky.

“Glory Saint Artifact!” Jin Jue was shocked that Lin Yun actually possessed a Glory Saint Artifact. He had seen Lin Yun using the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella while hiding outside the asteroid belt. But the umbrella looked no different from a rod in Lin Yun’s hand back then, and he couldn’t even bring out its full power.

It might be helpful against Dragon Pulse Realm experts who hadn’t condensed their dragon origin. But it was futile to a Samsara Edict Realm expert like him. So Jin Jue was surprised to see that Lin Yun could open the umbrella.

“Hmph!” With a cold snort, he patted the back of the Gold Flame Demonic Eagle. When the eagle opened its mouth, boundless flames swept out. Those were golden flames that could even burn through space. The flames were like magma and looked like a massive ocean.

“Damn it!” Lin Yun’s face turned pale, making it difficult for him to stand. Just when he was feeling despair, a figure flew out from the sword box and took over the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella in his hand.

The umbrella opened once more and blocked the sea of flames. But this time, the umbrella wasn’t just being opened, it was accompanied by eight dragons that flew out from the umbrella's surface. When they charged forth, they tore apart the sea of flames and collided with the Gold Flame Demonic Eagle.

Lil' Red was in its Ancient Dracoape form and used its dragon bloodline to activate the umbrella and fight Jin Jue. As the Gold Flame Demonic Eagle let out a howl, it began to sway while Lil’ Purple took this opportunity to put some distance between them.

“Damn it!” Jin Jue flew into a rage and barked, “Profound Sky Canon—Heavenly Moon!”

As a moon appeared behind him, Jin Jue raised his palm and slammed it down. As the moon revolved, countless starlights rained down, sending Lil’ Red flying away.

Lil’ Red’s huge figure smashed through several mountains before it fell into a lake, creating a huge splash. When the shockwave of this palm caught Lil’ Purple by surprise, she threw out a mouthful of blood before turning back into her little girl form. Since Lil’ Purple turned back into a humanoid form, they naturally fell from the sky.

When they raised their heads, the Sword Sect was still some distance away, while the moon and demonic eagle were right behind them. When Jin Jue landed on the ground, his face was ugly because he was forced to summon his constellation and even used his greatest trump card just to deal with a mere Elysium Core Realm cultivator. This naturally made his mood foul.

“Come here!” When Jin Jue raised his palm, a suction force exploded, and Lin Yun was being pulled over.

But right then, a leaf streaked across the horizon, leaving a wound on Jin Jue’s palm. This also erased the suction force from Jin Jue’s palm.

“Who is there?” Jin Jue’s face changed as he took several steps back.

“Sword Sect’s Mu Chuan!” A figure flew over. It was the peak master of the Divine Firmament Peak, Mu Chuan. Mu Chuan was wielding a sword in his left hand while gently waving his right hand, summoning the leaf back to him.

Before Jin Jue could react, the leaf swiftly flew out once more, but Mu Chuan’s sword was faster.

Although Jin Jue didn’t hesitate to turn and run for his life, a sword flew and shattered the moon and demonic eagle in the sky before landing on Jin Jue. When that sword landed on Jin Jue, the latter’s Profound Sky Armor broke along with a saint armor that he wore underneath.

“Senior Brother, Senior Brother Feng Jue is not going to hold on!” Lin Yun anxiously yelled as he carried Feng Jue.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Mu Chuan quickly sheathed his sword and came over to Feng Jue. When he examined Feng Jue’s condition, a faint sorrow appeared within his pupils.
