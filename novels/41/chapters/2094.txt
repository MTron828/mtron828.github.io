Chapter 2095: Tenth Transformation of the Nirvana Stage (1)

Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After refining some of the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet, Lin Yun’s cultivation was brought to the pinnacle ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, with nine stars revolving within his violet palace. The nirvana aura within his body had reached the limit, and he couldn’t gather any more nirvana aura within his body unless he made a breakthrough in his cultivation.

He only exhausted one-tenth of the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet, which showed how outrageous and powerful the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet was. Lin Yun shone brightly as the nirvana aura within his body reached a majestic height.

The aura that Lin Yun gave off had already reached the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage, which was the limit of a King. If he made a breakthrough again, he would reach the Quasi-Saint Realm.

This meant if Lin Yun wanted to, he could make a breakthrough to the Quasi-Saint Realm at anytime, not to mention the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet even contained dragon blood for him to refine. The effects of the dragon blood were even stronger than Nirvana Pellets, and he didn’t have to worry about using resources at the Quasi-Saint Realm while he had it.

Lin Yun felt a strong temptation to make a breakthrough. But as the light he gave off began to flicker along with his emotions, he ultimately suppressed the temptation with his rationale.

Looking at the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts with his eyes flickering. There were two paths ahead of him, one was to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm, and the other was to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

There wasn’t any risk for him to make a breakthrough to the Quasi-Saint Realm, but it was dangerous if he wanted to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

“It’s still worth trying to reach the limits of the Nirvana Stage, even if the process is dangerous.” Lin Yun made up his mind after a while and no longer hesitated.

Zhao Tianyu’s greater dao made too much of an impact, and he couldn’t comprehend saint dao at the Azure Origin Phase, even if he made a breakthrough to the Quasi-Saint Realm. Thus, he would rather take the risk. If he succeeded in reaching the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, his foundation from reaching the limits of the Empyrean, Elysium Core, Dragon Pulse, and Nirvana Stages might be fully excavated, allowing him to reach the Indigo Origin Phase in one go upon reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm.

At that time, he would have a stronger foundation to step onto the saint path.

Lil’ Purple opened her eyes beneath the Phoenix Tree within the Iris Secret Realm and looked at Lin Yun. When she saw that Lin Yun had fallen into deep thoughts while looking at the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet, she instantly knew what he wanted to do.

“This scumbag… I knew that he wouldn't be able to hold himself back.” Lil’ Purple muttered to herself before sighing and coming before Lin Yun. She asked, “You’ve made up your mind?”

“Yeah.” Lin Yun nodded. He raised the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet before him and said, “The two mistresses said that I don’t have enough of a foundation, but the value of this pellet seems to be more powerful than they thought.”

The True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet was pure dragon’s blood refined into a bead. Lin Yun possessed two Dragon Clan saint physiques, so he could receive double the benefits by refining it. He had barely refined one-tenth of the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet, and it had already brought his cultivation to the pinnacle ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

“The process will be painful later, so put this in your mouth.” Lil’ Purple took out a leaf and handed it to Lin Yun.

“A leaf of the Phoenix Tree?” Lin Yun was surprised. After all, Lil’ Purple treated the Phoenix Tree as her treasure, so Lin Yun was surprised that she was willing to give him a leaf.

“This is the leaf from the top of the tree, and I only have this one for now. The Phoenix Tree might be a sapling, but it’s precious, and it can ensure your safety. So you’ll become stronger even if you fail in your breakthrough,” Lil’ Purple said seriously.

“This one leaf is that magical? I don’t need it. You can keep it for yourself.” Lin Yun looked at the leaf and noticed that there were mysterious runes on it that looked like meridians with golden light flowing on it.

This made the leaf look mysterious and gave off an ancient aura. Lin Yun could tell that this leaf was precious. This meant he couldn’t use it because it must be of great use to Lil’ Purple.

“Don’t you know how lucky you are? There might be many leaves on the Phoenix Tree, but only one?contains a phoenix’s energy, and even I can’t bear to use it. Have you heard of a Phoenix undergoing nirvana? After undergoing nirvana, the ashes they leave behind would be absorbed by trees on the ground, and even I have no idea how many times this sacred tree has experienced a phoenix’s nirvana,” Lil’ Purple said furiously. According to her, calling it the Divine Phoenix Leaf might be more appropriate.

“Alright, I’ll give it a try.” Lin Yun placed the leaf into his mouth after Lil’ Purple became furious.

Lil’ Purple smiled, “That’s more like it. I’m not feeling heartache for you, but I’m worried that something might happen to you. If you’re gone, no one else can help me get true dragon saint liquid.”

Lin Yun smiled, but didn’t expose her. He began breaking into the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. When the dragon blood within the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet entered his body, it converged within his heart. As Lin Yun’s heart throbbed, he was using the energy converted by the dragon blood to forcefully make a breakthrough.

Whenever the dragon blood’s energy surged within his body, it would produce a thunderous rumble that sounded much more terrifying than a dragon’s roar.

Others would normally break into the Quasi-Saint Realm and slowly accumulate resources to reach the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm before comprehending saint dao. But Lin Yun didn’t have the luxury of choosing his means because his enemies were too powerful, not to mention that Lin Yun also wanted to take an unprecedented path of a Sword God. Thus, Lin Yun naturally had to have high expectations of himself.

After a few hundred impacts within his body, blood dripped down from Lin Yun’s lips, and his body began to violently tremble. Even so, his breakthrough wasn’t successful. But Lin Yun didn’t give up so easily and used the Blue Dragon Bone to heal his injuries before manipulating the dragon blood’s energy to carry on with his breakthrough.

A thousand attempts later, a fine crack finally appeared on the bottleneck to the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

Lin Yun took a deep breath as he steadily refined the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet and continued with his breakthrough.

Half a day later, Lin Yun finally opened up one-tenth of the bottleneck to the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. But cracks appeared throughout his body, with blood gushing out.

He had to make a breakthrough in one go once he started making a breakthrough to the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, so he couldn’t give up halfway. Otherwise, the flow of his blood would be reversed. In light cases, the backlash might cause his cultivation to drop. In serious cases, his body might blow apart.

Many people would faint from the pain when trying to reach the limit, thus failing to make a breakthrough. In those scenarios, they would lose their cultivation even if they’ve managed to survive the backlash. The breakthrough to the limit was dangerous and cruel.

Lin Yun had experienced this three times, and this time wasn’t an exception either. Furthermore, because of his deep foundation, this breakthrough to the limit of the Nirvana Stage was even more painful than his past breakthroughs.

Lin Yun persevered with his strong willpower. When half of the bottleneck to the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage finally opened to him, Lin Yun could no longer feel himself. This was because the pain reached an unbearable height with his clothes stained in blood. His consciousness gradually blurred, but he grit his teeth whenever the thought of giving up appeared.
