Chapter 758 - Returning To The Sect!

The phenomenon soon dissipated with Yan Long’zi’s departure. He tried searching for the Flamedragon Fruit after he recovered from his injuries, but he left when he couldn’t find it.

“Yan Long’zi? Which sect does this fellow belong to? Lil’ Purple, do you know anything about him?” Lin Yun asked.

“He should be from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion, he has a strong demon clan’s aura. He might also possess a trace of the dragon clan’s bloodline, which is where he got his name from,” replied the Indigothunder Dragonvulture casually.

“He’s really strong.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed. Yan Long’zi left in a hurry, which probably meant that he was heading for the beast tide. After all, the final battle wouldn’t end so quickly. He couldn’t imagine the waves Yan Long’zi would cause when he showed up at Swordmire City.

“I need to continue!” Lin Yun felt great pressure from Yan Long’zi, so he swallowed half of the Flamedragon Fruit.

With half of the fruit entering his body, flames erupted on his body and incinerated the clothes covering his torso. His pupils turned into golden flames and his blood boiled like crazy. Then, golden flames poured out of his pores almost as if they were about to incinerate him.

Just as the medicinal effects were about to cover his entire body and incinerate his internal organs, a dragon roar echoed from within Lin Yun’s body. All fifty-four dragon runes on the surface of his body came to life and wandered on the surface of his body.

The medicinal effects were instantly refined by the dragon runes and turned into lightning. The violent lightning energy began to cause a powerful gale to blow while the clouds tumbled in the sky. Soon, thunderclouds filled the sky.

Lin Yun was enveloped in flames as waves of lightning leaked out of his body.

“Wind and lightning, the divine ability of the ancient azure dragons.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture was inwardly shocked as it looked at the phenomenon caused by Lin Yun. The Indigothunder Dragonvulture looked at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze because it realized that it couldn’t see through this young man.

Back then, Lin Yun had the ability to kill it. As an overlord demonic beast with the dragon clan’s bloodline, its beast core was a lot more precious than this Flamedragon Fruit. But Lin Yun actually chose to save its life. Was it because Lin Yun took some of its blood essence?

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture couldn’t understand Lin Yun’s thought process. In the end, it closed its eyes and rested in a comfrotable position. The Indigothunder Dragonvulture had to admit that Lin Yun was a little insane to eat such a large chunk of the Flamedragon Fruit.

But seven days later, Lin Yun did something even more insane. Before he was even finished with refining the portion of the Flamedragon Fruit that he previously swallowed, he swallowed the rest of the fruit.This included the dragon head, which was where most of the essence was stored.

Golden flames soared into the sky and instantly devoured the thunderclouds. The entire sky was being incinerated and the terrifying phenomenon left all the demonic beasts in Flamedragon Hill terrified.

“Azure Dragon Enneaform, break!” Lin Yun’s hair began to flutter in the wind with lightning flickering on the surface of his body. He wanted to take this opportunity to raise the Azure Dragon Enneaform to the octaform stage by refining the rest of the Flamedragon Fruit. He didn’t want to waste a single piece.

This was an opportunity that Jian Wuming left behind three thousand years ago. As a disciple of the Sword Firmament Pavilion, he couldn’t let fail. Additionally, he wanted to fight with the strongest geniuses of the Ancient Southern Domain. He wanted the Flower Burial Sword to shine brightly when facing the three kings and seven elites.

The ancient azure dragon energy within Lin Yun’s body began to circulate violently as it refined the Flamedragon Fruit. Ten days later, the flames in the sky slowly receded as Lin Yun opened his eyes. A purple flash of lightning flickered in his pupils.

Letting out a sigh, Lin Yun basked in the sunlight that shined on him. His physique wasn’t as robust as the other cultivators who specialized in body-refining techniques. However, his figure was lean and every single part of his muscles were filled with explosive power.

After reaching the octaform stage in the Azure Dragon Enneaform, the dragon runes on his body had grown to seventy-two and they intertwined like an azure dragon. Filled with an ancient aura, he also gave off immense pressure.

As the boundless azure dragon energy flowed within his body, he could feel his blood boiling. His pores slightly opened up and he was enveloped with a purple glow. This phenomenon had appeared on Lin Yun once in the past, but it was a lot smoother this time. He could now control it as he wished.

Lin Yun was like a purple sun that brimmed with power as he slowly stood up. Raising his brow, Lin Yun looked at the Indigothunder Dragonvulture and said, “Lil’ Purple, spar with me for a little.”

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture opened its eyes and its gaze fell on Lin Yun. This time, it looked at Lin Yun with seriousness. At the same time, the pressure that belonged to an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast came crashing down on Lin Yun.

“You’re finally getting serious.” Lin Yun had excitement on his face, but he didn’t bring out his sword intent. He only circulated his Azure Dragon Enneaform and slowly walked forward. As a dragon roar echoed from within his body, a purple mist spread out on the surface of his face. Once again, Lin Yun looked like a gigantic purple sun.

In the next moment, Lin Yun clashed with the Indigothunder Dragonvulture as all seventy-two dragon runes began to wander on the surface of his body. At this moment, he looked like an actual azure dragon. When the Azure Dragon Mark bloomed, the dragon roar from within his body tore the clouds apart.

Under his attack, the Indigothunder Dragonvulture was actually pushed back. Lin Yun waved his hand and smiled, “How is this attack compared to Yan Long’zi’s?”

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture supported its massive body with its wings and said, “It’s hard to say. You didn’t use your sword. I fought him with our lives on the line, while we’re simply sparing. But you should have the qualification to fight him. You only lack the foundation.”

There was no way Lin Yun could compete in foundation. After all, Yan Long’zi became one of the three kings four years ago. He had most definitely grown stronger as time passed. It was obvious that Lin Yun was still lacking in comparison to Yan Long’zi. However, his inheritance came from Iris Sword Saint, so his accomplishment in the sword had transcended all the geniuses in the Ancient Southern Domain. As a swordsman, he wouldn’t be defeated easily and Lin Yun would make Yan Long’zi pay if he took it easy.

“I seem to be able to practice your cultivation technique…” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture said after some hesitation while its eyes were brimming with expectation.

“Oh?” Lin Yun was stunned. A demonic beast can also practice a human cultivation technique? How is that possible?” But Lin Yun figured it out almost immediately. The Azure Dragon Enneaform came from the Azure Dragon and the only requirement to refine this technique was to refine the Azure Dragon’s blood. Then, the later stages of the technique required one to refine the blood of demonic beasts that contained the dragon clan’s bloodline.

If the Indigothunder Dragonvulture practiced it, it would be equivalent to giving wings to a tiger. At the very least, the Indigothunder Dragonvulture wouldn’t have to worry about blood as it was a demonic beast with the dragon clan’s bloodline. The Azure Dragon Enneaform could even strengthen its bloodline. It was even more of a coincidence that the Indigothunder Dragonvulture was also a lightning attributed demonic beast.

“Sure. I can teach you,” replied Lin Yun straightforwardly, which exceeded the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s expectation.

“Are you serious?” it asked.

“What? You think I’m bluffing?” Lin Yun smiled. Since he said that he would teach it, then he would naturally teach the Indigothunder Dragonvulture. But he would regret his decision in three days.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s cultivation speed was too terrifying as it had reached the quadform after three days. This made Lin Yun realize that the advantage he once had was gone. He would truly be crushed if they fought.

No matter how hard he cultivated, he couldn’t catch up to the Indigothunder Dragonvulture. So much so that he had to bring out his Flower Burial Sword, but even then he barely kept up with it. But the pressure had also strengthened Lin Yun as his spiritual sword intent began to fuse with the Azure Dragon Enneaform.

One day later, after Lin Yun finished sparring with the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, he sat down and rested. Suddenly, several aerial demonic beasts flew across the sky with their cultivators. He could tell that they were flying back from Swordmire City to their respective clans.

“How many times has it been now?” mumbled Lin Yun. He could even see geniuses riding their aerial demonic beasts.

“A lot. The beast tide should’ve ended by now, so everyone’s returning.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture replied.

With the beast tide coming to an end, Lin Yun felt a little regret. After all, he didn’t participate in the final battle. Many geniuses must’ve made a breakthrough in the final battle and Yan Long’zi should have been there as well. It was a shame that he missed it. With the final battle, everyone would have forgotten about him killing the ten Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts.

“Lil’ Purple, I have to leave now,” said Lin Yun as he patted on his clothes.

“Let me send you back to the Great Qin Empire.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture said.

“Isn’t it a little too inappropriate?” Lin Yun smiled awkwardly. How many people would be frightened to death if he rode an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast back? Not to mention that the Indigothunder Dragonvulture was now comparable to a monarch demonic beast. Those who didn’t know him might think that he was an empyrean.

“What’s inappropriate about it? These people rode the aerial demonic beasts they subdued and you naturally can’t lose to them,” said the Indigothunder Dragonvulture before it lowered its head.

“Alright, let us go back to the Great Qin Empire’s Sword Firmament Pavilion then!” Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he laughed.
