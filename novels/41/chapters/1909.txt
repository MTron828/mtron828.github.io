Chapter 1910 - That's Right, I'm Here Waiting For You

The eyes of the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden’s pupils shone brightly while looking at this scene. She never expected someone so insignificant a year ago to have such a drastic transformation. Was that still the Ye Qingtian she knew? Or was he someone else?

In reality, even she doubted it because Ye Qingtian was the same as the Ye Qingtian she knew in terms of temperament and expression, aside from forgetting some things. But if he was Ye Qingtian, how could he not recognize her? Was he doing that on purpose? The Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden thought about many things and realized she couldn’t see through Ye Qingtian now.

Even Bai Shuying had opened her eyes because Ye Qingtian’s attainment in the sword was a little frightening.

Lin Yun slowly sheathed the Flower Burial Sword. Strictly speaking, Lin Yun had only used two swords because he didn’t use any sword technique in facing the last opponent.

Just when Lin Yun was about to leave the stage, an incident occurred. The headless person dashed again, executing a terrifying attack with afterimages covering the entire sky and turning into a black Ghost Howler. When it waved its sword, the Ghost Howler roared, wanting to devour Lin Yun.

“Pitiful tricks…” Lin Yun shook his head. The dragon aura of his saint physique was depressed, but his sword intent wasn’t restricted. He had already sheathed his sword and didn’t want to draw it out, so he flicked his finger and unleashed a dazzling sword ray from his finger, destroying the Ghost Howler and gatekeeper.

“You have made it through the trial.” An ancient voice resounded.

Lin Yun jumped off the stage and turned to look at Ye Feifan before he smiled, “Thank you for your encouragement. I still wouldn't have known if you didn’t remind me. When I reach the summit, I’ll spare you a Heavenly Cloud Fruit.”

Lin Yun immediately left after that, ignoring Ye Feifan’s ugly expression.

“That fellow… is really cocky,” Chen Zhong smiled, and he now understood why everyone from the Nether Orchid Courtyard would say that Ye Qingtian was cocky.

On the other hand, Ye Feifan nearly threw out a mouthful of blood.

“He’s really cocky. He made it through the trial and even mocked Ye Feifan, saying to spare him one. Did he really consider Ye Feifan to be his lackey?”

“If I was Ye Feifan, I would probably charge forth.”

“Ye Feifan is a coward. Now that Ye Qingtian made it through the trial, he can only suck it up.”

“Shush. He can hear you all. Just look at his face…” All the saint disciples were discussing amongst themselves, and they could see Ye Feifan’s face becoming ugly. But this only made Ye Feifan feel even more ashamed.

But no one shows compassion towards him, since everyone knew he waneds to humiliate Ye Qingtian, only to have failed and be humiliated himself, instead. He wanted to suppress Ye Qingtian in front of the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden at the foot of the mountain. If Bai Shuying didn’t speak out for Ye Qingtian, he would have definitely taught Ye Qingtian a lesson. He didn’t place Ye Qingtian in his eyes, so he could only suck it up now that he was humiliated.

“Ye Qingtian, wait up!” Wang Muyan smiled, soaring to the sky under everyone’s shocked gazes. It turned out that she had already made it through the trial and didn’t have to go through the trial again. She only stayed here because she wanted to probe Ye Qingtian.

After all, Ye Qingtian's grace didn’t seem to belong to someone who was only at the Profound Death Stage. Wang Muyan donned a purple robe and swiftly disappeared before everyone.

Ye Feifan’s gaze was cold, and he realized he was careless and was fooled by Ye Qingtian. If he knew about this beforehand, he wouldn’t have tried to act like a gentleman before Bai Shuying and would’ve taught Ye Qingtian a lesson at the foot of the mountain.

Lin Yun moved quickly. Wang Muyan only caught up after he made it through the second trial.

“Ye Qingtian, do you know you’re in deep trouble?” Wang Muyan’s voice resounded.

When Lin Yun turned around, he saw Wang Muyan following behind him. After donning the purple robe, Wang Muyan changed into a completely different person, which was weird. This made Lin Yun wonder if Wang Muyan had practiced any special cultivation techniques or if perhaps it was related to charming techniques.

“Ye Feifan might seem like a gentleman on the surface, but he’s a petty person. In the past, he always relied on his identity as a fellow clansman to teach you a lesson, and he didn’t hold back in his moves. You have already offended him, and he won’t let you off so easily,” Wang Muyan smiled with her flawless face.

“Isn’t it all because of you?” Lin Yun smiled. If it weren’t for Wang Muyan, Ye Feifan wouldn’t have been jealous and try to lay down a trap for him.

“But it doesn’t matter. I didn’t intend to let him go, anyways.” Lin Yun continued. There were still two trials ahead of him. The geniuses in the Heavenly Dao Sect made him feel pressured, and he was in a hurry to grasp the Astral Sword Intent.

“Ye Qingtian, why don’t you visit Heavenly Yin Palace? You have no place in the Ye Clan, to begin with. Not to mention that you offended Zhang Yue, and Bai Shuying doesn’t like you. Out of the four clans, only the Wang Clan can accept you, now,” Wang Muyan smiled, floating over and landing before Lin Yun.

Letting out a breath, Wang Muyan continued to flirt with Lin Yun, “You can consider becoming a son-in-law of the Wang Clan. As long as you follow me, no one can bully you.”

“Not interested,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“Ye Qingtian, you’ve changed. You have really changed. Haven't you been in love with me before?” Wang Muyan said in a sorrowful voice. “It has only been a year. Have I lost my charm compared to someone like Bai Shuying?”

“Lass, don’t bother using your charming techniques on me. I’m not interested, and I only find you funny,” Lin Yun smiled, and he continued.

“Didn’t your master tell you not to show you back to a woman?” Wang Muyan kept her smile, and a blood moon rose within her pupils. When she looked at Lin Yun’s back figure, her five fingers became crystals, emitting a piercing aura. At the same time, a murderous intent also began to spread out.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Lin Yun didn’t go far, but Wang Muyan was fast. Because she was too fast and the distance was too short, Lin Yun didn’t even have the time to turn around.

But a sword vibration suddenly echoed, and the Flower Burial Sword flew out, thrusting towards Wang Muyan’s forehead. Wang Muyan wasn’t bothered about it and didn’t think this sword could injure her. But when the sword ray dashed over, Wang Muyan’s face changed. She quickly left behind a few afterimages and retreated.

“A Glory Saint Artifact!” Wang Muyan’s face was covered with shock when she landed on the ground.

Lin Yun slowly turned around. Before Wang Muyan could even move, he had sensed a wisp of danger with his Sword Heart. Although he managed to sense it, he couldn’t avoid it in time, even if he wanted to.

After he turned around, the Flower Burial Sword flew over and returned to the sheath. But Wang Muyan didn’t dare to be careless while looking at the sword. She could sense that the Glory Saint Artifact wasn’t simple.

“Woman, haven’t you been talking about Yin-Yang cultivation? What’s the matter? You want to kill your husband now?” Lin Yun asked in an indifferent voice.

“Who wants to perform Yin-Yang cultivation with you? Are you even worthy? I only have a question for you, are you really Ye Qingtian?!” Wang Muyan’s eyes flashed with disdain.

Lin Yun was cautious, fearing that there might be ears around. He replied, “I’m naturally Ye Qingtian. It’s just that I have lost some memories.”

“I can’t be bothered to act with you, and that sword won’t be able to save you,” Wang Muyan smiled. “Who the hell are you? What motives do you have for disguising yourself as Ye Qingtian? If you don’t speak, be prepared to die here today.”

Ye Qingtian knew her secrets, and she could only silence him if she couldn’t make sure if Ye Qingtian was really Ye Qingtian.

“Who the hell are you?” Lin Yun’s face became grave, and he could sense that this woman had an ulterior motive.

“You shouldn’t know about it,” Wang Muyan smiled, and she dashed over with her aura rising. The aura she gave off reached the pinnacle fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

Lin Yun immediately sensed the pressure coming from Wang Muyan. The latter was cautious, and she paid much attention to Lin Yun’s sword. But until she got close, she became uncertain because Lin Yun had no intention of drawing his sword.

“An act!” Wang Muyan snorted, and her five fingers flew towards Lin Yun’s face without hesitation.

“Om!” A voice resounded, and Lin Yun became enveloped in a prestigious, holy aura-like Buddha. When the voice echoed within Wang Muyan’s ears, this struck a heavy blow to her soul, and the space before her distorted.

This made Wang Muyan’s face change. Although she managed to shatter the soundwave before her, she also took ten-odd steps back.

When she looked at Lin Yun’s right hand, a set of Buddhist beads appeared in his hand; it was another Glory Saint Artifact! This immediately made Wang Muyan anxious, “Who the hell is this fellow? Why does he have so many Glory Saint Artifacts…”

A torrential sword aura flew out when Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword. The surroundings were covered with sword rays. But the more they fought, the more furious Wang Muyan became. She was clearly stronger than Lin Yun, but the latter used the beads whenever she got close, forcing her to retreat before attacking with the Flower Burial Sword.

In her opinion, this should have been a one-sided battle, but it became a stalemate. Although she would win if they continued to fight, this was the Celestial Purging Mountain. So there would certainly be people coming over.

“I give up!” Wang Muyan gasped her breath and was secretly alarmed. She looked at Lin Yun and smiled, “I don’t care about your identity. So don’t get involved in my affairs, and I won’t get involved in yours.”

“Not to get involved in each other’s affairs? I’m not so sure about that.” Lin Yun had no intention of backing off, mainly because she didn’t believe Wang Muyan because his senior brother and Ye Xinyan resided in the Heavenly Dao Sect. If Wang Muyan wanted to do anything to the Heavenly Dao Sect, he naturally wouldn’t sit and watch.

“Ha. Do you think you can defeat me with those two Glory Saint Artifacts? We’ll see…” Wang Muyan glared at Lin Yun before she dashed away from Lin Yun.

Lin Yun sheathed his sword and placed the Flower Burial Sword on the ground to recover. It was exhausting to use two Glory Saint Artifacts at once. The Flower Burial Sword was still alright because it had become a part of him, but the beads were exhausting. Not only did it exhaust his dragon origin, but also his vitality and mental energy.

Wang Muyan was truly impressive because she only suffered light injuries from an attack from the beads. Although this was the first time Lin Yun had used the beads, it was still a Glory Saint Artifact. He now realized that the women within the Heavenly Dao Sect were terrifying.

The Flower Burial Sword was guarding him from the side since Lin Yun was afraid that Wang Muyan might return. But he had to hurry up, or it would become a headache when Bai Shuying caught up. Thus, he circulated the Azure Dragon Skybreaking Art to recover, which lasted half an hour before he breathed out and ended his meditation.

But he saw a white figure walking over when he opened his eyes. It was Bai Shuying, whom he hoped to not run into.

“You’re waiting for me?” Bai Shuying asked after a brief surprise flashed across her pupils.

“I…” Lin Yun momentarily hesitated before smiling, “That’s right. I’m here waiting for Senior Sister. I’m afraid you might misunderstand, so I wanted to wait here and explain it.”
