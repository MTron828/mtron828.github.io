Chapter 2032 - Don't Be Complacent

Lin Yun calmed his mind and said, “Mistress, I only need the Divine Blood Fruit to fuse my two saint physiques?”

The Serene Dust Great Saint shook her head and said, “I don’t think it’s that simple. The books Long Yun went through were borrowed from me. The Azure Dragon Divine Physique is powerful, and there has never been anyone who has acquired it, other than being born with it. The Divine Dragon Void Sea your master went to has an ancient island that was once called the Heavenly Astral Island, an important ruin of the Dragon Gate…”

The Serene Dust Great Saint came from the Divine Dragon Empire, so she understood the Dragon Gate better than others.

“Even if you can barely fuse it, you won’t go too far with it without the Divine Blood Fruit. Aside from the Divine Blood Fruit, you will also need some of the dragon clan’s body-refining techniques to perfect the Azure Dragon Divine Physique,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said.

Lin Yun was touched that the Dragon Origin Great Saint was doing so much for him, taking such a huge risk for his Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

The Serene Dust Great Saint interrupted Lin Yun’s thoughts and asked, “Yun’er, I’ve heard that you have grasped a powerful sword technique. Can you show it to me?”

Lin Yun rejoiced when he heard that because he had just comprehended Sword of the Beginning, but many profundities far exceeded his knowledge. With the Serene Dust Great Saint’s cultivation, she should be able to notice something he couldn’t, and he didn’t hesitate to agree.

“Mistress, the Sword of the Beginning is a sword technique that I have created, divided into Light of the Beginning, Boundless of the Beginning, Glory of the Beginning, Eternity of the Beginning, Darkness of the Beginning, and Nirvana of the Beginning.” Lin Yun made a simple introduction and continued, “Every sword has hundreds of varieties, and the one you heard of is called Light of the Beginning.”

Lin Yun took a few steps and slowly executed Light of the Beginning. When he swung his sword, primal chaos was split with a world being born. Even if Lin Yun had slowed down on purpose, his sword was still fast and drew an exclamation from the Serene Dust Great Saint, who was shocked, “What a powerful sword technique!”

A white-clothed figure appeared. It was the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

Lin Yun was inwardly shocked when he saw the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. He had no idea what she was doing here. After all, didn’t she have a bad relationship with the Serene Dust Great Saint?

The Serene Dust Great Saint unhappily said, “Bai Ziyuan, didn’t you say that you’ll only observe in the dark? When did I allow you to show yourself?”

But the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint ignored the Serene Dust Great Saint and looked at Lin Yun, “Your sword has nirvana in it, and it’s stronger than when you used it during the ranking battle. You must have received an opportunity within the Myriad Graves Valley.”

Lin Yun nodded and cupped his hands together. But he couldn’t say anything because he didn’t know how to address the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. After briefly hesitating, he could only toughen his scalp and said, “I pay my greetings to the Mistress.”

“No need to be so polite,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“Do you think you’re worthy of being called Mistress?” The Serene Dust Great Saint furiously questioned.

“Even you’re shameless enough to accept it, so why won’t I dare?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint turned to coldly look at the Serene Dust Great Saint.

“You!” The Serene Dust Great Saint instantly became furious and waved her hand, “Leave. I don’t welcome you here.”

“You make it sound as if I wanted to be here. I’ll bring Ye Qingtian with me,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“You’re not allowed to leave with him!” The Serene Dust Great Saint said.

Lin Yun was sandwiched between the two, making him nervous because he didn’t dare to make a move. The Serene Dust Great Saint glared at the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and the atmosphere became terrifying because the two Great Saints could fight at any moment. Lin Yun didn’t know who to listen to, and he could only blame it on his master, the Radiant Sword Saint.

“I pay my respect to Master and Martial Aunt.” Xin Yan walked over with a smile, and the tension in the atmosphere eased with her appearance. She comforted, “Master, Martial Aunt is only guiding Junior Brother Ye in his sword technique, which is for his own good.”

“You can teach him, but it has to be in the Profound Maiden Courtyard. I heard that he suffered a lot in the Nether Orchid Courtyard, and he was even framed for committing blasphemy against the holy maiden,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said coldly.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I didn’t frame him,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“How is that not framing? You think such an ordinary girl will catch Yun’er’s attention?” The Serene Dust Great Saint said in disdain.

Lin Yun couldn’t help wearing a bitter smile when she said that. If the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden was ordinary, there would be no beauties in the world.

Xin Yan smiled, “Martial Aunt, it looks like you’ll have to teach him in the Profound Maiden Courtyard.”

“That was my intention, to begin with,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. She then continued, “Come with me.”

The Serene Dust Great Saint wanted to flare up, but Xin Yan barely comforted her. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint left with Lin Yun and came to where Lin Yun usually trained. The depths of the Profound Maiden Courtyard was a cliff that was engraved with a giant Buddha, and there was a spacious plaza before the cliff.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked, “Do you know what a swordsman is?”

“More or less. I heard from my master that only those who have grasped the Firmament Sword Intent could barely be considered a swordsman. Otherwise, they can only be considered cultivators who use the sword,” Lin Yun said.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint deeply looked at Lin Yun and said, “What you said is right. A swordsman cultivates the heart while everyone else can only be considered cultivators who use the sword.”

“Senior, can I ask about the difference between the sword and heart?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, “Someone who uses the sword uses it as a tool. So even if you grasped a Ghost Spirit Sword Technique or Dragon Spirit Sword Technique, they could not be considered swordsmen. A real swordsman trains in his heart, and I know you have achieved the Sword Heart.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned upon hearing that before nodding his head.

“Do you know how to cultivate the Sword Heart?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked.

Lin Yun nodded his head, “A little.”

Ye Guhan had taught him how to cultivate the Sword Heart, and it was a secret technique of the Radiant’s lineage, the Myriad Astral Celestial Art. It was divided into the Myriad Astral Seal and Celestial Seal. The former could temper the Astral Sword Intent while the latter could grasp the Sword Heart.

“Not bad.” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint nodded and said, “Aside from that, the Divine Firefly Sword can also temper the Sword Heart. This sword technique that was left behind by the Sword Ancestor was divided into three parts, the entry section, saint section, and dao section. After reaching the third section, you’ll be able to grasp sword dao. It could barely be considered a shortcut to a Sovereign Dao.”

“Why did you say ‘barely’?” Lin Yun asked.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint sighed, “That’s because the Divine Firefly Sword is hard to cultivate, and it has a high threshold. Only a few can step into it because not many people can step into the Saint Realm, and the third section is even harder.

“You’re a genius swordsman, and you have long grasped the sword heart. But don’t bite more than what you can chew. You might be considered a genius within the Eastern Desolation, but not within the Kunlun Realm.”

Lin Yun naturally knew that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was telling him not to be complacent and don’t forget that he was a swordsman. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was afraid that Lin Yun might forget himself after grasping Sword of the Beginning. But even if this was a powerful sword technique, it was just a sword technique.

Seeing Lin Yun in deep thoughts, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint lightly nodded. She knew that Lin Yun was smart, and he could figure it out himself. After all, Lin Yun was a disciple with high hopes placed on him by the Radiant Sword Saint.

“How old are you this year?”

“Twenty-five years old.”

“It’s impressive that you can become first on the King Ranking at the age of twenty-five. But remember that this is only the Eastern Desolation.”

Lin Yun was rather optimistic about it because he slaughtered his way to come this far. It was just the beginning for him because he wanted to walk on a path as a Sword God.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was even more satisfied with Lin Yun after seeing how humble he was. She glanced at the Serene Dust Great Saint’s location and said, “The Serene Dust Great Saint dotes on you too much, and I heard she gave you a lot of resources, including a Dragon Saint Pellet. This doting is no different from poison, and it will only do more harm to you.”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled when he heard that because he wouldn’t mind having more of this ‘poison.’

“I naturally have my reasons for being strict with you. After all, how can a sword be sharp without tempering?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

The Serene Dust Great Saint was furious when she heard that. She wanted to flare up immediately, but she was stopped by Xin Yan. She roared, “Don’t stop me! I have to teach that bitch a lesson today!”

Xin Yan bitterly smiled because her master was a Great Saint, and the Serene Dust Great Saint could break free from her hold if she wanted to. But Xin Yan still said, “Master, please calm down. Let’s talk about it later.”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, “How many swords did you see from the thirty-six paintings I used to imprison you that day?”

Lin Yun couldn’t help wearing a bitter expression because he really had to really think about it. He initially thought it was the Wither Sword Art back then. Although it was obscure, he still managed to remember the swords he saw.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint wore a satisfied expression, and this was her method of hammering Lin Yun’s pride. Otherwise, Lin Yun might get over his head for killing a Quasi-Saint. When she saw Lin Yun wearing a difficult expression, she smiled, “There’s no need to hurry. I purposely increased the difficulty back then, and the thirty-six paintings were in a mess. Before I reached the Quasi-Saint Realm in the past, I only…”

“Mistress, nine swords. It was too obscure, and I couldn’t remember it all. I only managed to remember the nine swords I saw,” Lin Yun patted his forehead and said unhappily. If he knew it was the second part of the Divine Firefly Sword, he wouldn’t have left in such a hurry.

He knew that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was testing him.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was stumped when she heard what Lin Yun said. He remembered nine swords before she guided him in it? She immediately shut her mouth and swallowed what she wanted to say. Back then, she only remembered three swords when facing such a test before reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm. Even so, her master praised her for being a genius swordsman because of it.

That was a sword technique that only those at the Quasi-Saint Realm could barely comprehend, a sword technique that could temper the heart. In the end, Lin Yun remembered nine swords when she wanted to hammer him so that he wouldn’t be complacent. If she spoke a little faster earlier, she would’ve become a joke and slapped herself in her face.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint unhappily said, “Are you sure you didn’t remember wrongly?”

“It should be nine swords,” Lin Yun said cautiously. “I tried them many times back then before comprehending them, and I’m not sure if I made a mistake.”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was speechless and could only praise Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple for being a genius. She nodded, “Not bad. You’re only one sword away from catching up to me.”

Lin Yun rejoiced upon being praised by the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

But the Serene Dust Great Saint’s voice resounded from afar, “Bullshit. I bet you didn’t see that many swords.”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint simply ignored what the Serene Dust Great Saint said and continued, “I initially planned on teaching them to you after you came out, but who knew you went to the Celestial Pool.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling awkward when he heard that.

“It’s not too late to teach you now. I will perform the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword. All you have to do is watch, you…” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint initially wanted to tell Lin Yun that he didn’t have to remember it all. But she thought of something and changed, “You just have to observe well and remember them all.”
