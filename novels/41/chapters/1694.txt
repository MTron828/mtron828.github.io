Chapter 1695 – Cripple You

Jiang Feng reached Lin Yun in the blink of an eye, and the powerful aura he gave off made Lin Yun, Lin Wan, and Luo Shuyi feel tremendous pressure.

“Young Master Lin!” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi exclaimed.

While a cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, he wasn’t in a hurry to turn around. He pushed his hands forth, pushing away Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi, before he turned around. When he was done, it was already too late for him to do anything as Jiang Feng’s palm fell onto his right shoulder.

But it didn’t go as Jiang Feng had expected. He expected that his palm would be able to shatter Lin Yun’s bone and injure his internal organs. But the surface of Lin Yun’s body was densely packed with intertwining dragon runes, and his palm only managed to shatter some of the dragon runes.

The shattered dragon runes scattered, causing the wind to howl and thunder to rumble. Amids the howling wind and rumbling thunder, Lin Yun stood firmly and wasn’t injured by Jiang Feng’s attack.

“You!” Jiang Feng was shocked to see that Lin Yun was unscathed. He thought he could heavily injure Lin Yun if he could catch the latter by surprise, and make Lin Yun kneel before him with another palm. Even if Lin Yun could respond in time, he would still be forced to retreat and end up injured. But the outcome was different from what he had expected. Was the Azure Dragon Saint Physique this powerful?

“I don’t believe it!” A cold light flashed within Jiang Feng’s pupils as five dragon pulses appeared behind him. The appearance of the dragon pulses brought Jiang Feng’s aura to a terrifying height as he left behind after images in the air while his barrage of fists rained down on Lin Yun.

As the collisions echoed and the ground crumbled, Lin Yun merely stood there, unmoving. The dragon runes on the surface of his body were like a layer of armor. No matter how Jiang Feng attacked, the Blue Dragon Bone would replenish the destroyed dragon runes and protect him from any harm.

It didn’t take long for Jiang Feng to finish throwing a few hundred punches.

“Is it fun?” Lin Yun said, looking at Jiang Feng.

Jiang Feng was inwardly shocked and could feel a chill run down his spine from Lin Yun’s gaze. He quickly pulled himself back and retreated.

But when Lin Yun spoke, he had already pushed his palm out, circulating the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art. As a dragon roar echoed from within his body, his massive vitality started pouring out, and a thunderstorm suddenly rose.

This made Jiang Feng throw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away. When he landed on the ground, he took another three steps back and nearly fell onto the floor.

“H-How is this possible?!” The surroundings fell into a dead silence as everyone looked at Lin Yun with deep shock within their pupils. They began to wonder if Lin Yun was a monster. After all, how could a human rely only on their physique to be on equal footing with a fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm? UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

As Jiang Feng’s face turned pale, he threw out a mouthful of blood before he managed to resolve the thunderstorm energy within his body. He quickly walked towards a nearby mat and sat down before he coldly looked at Lin Yun, “You’re really a barbarian. Let me show you the true strength of a musician!”

Everyone came to their senses now. Jiang Feng’s cultivation might not be low, but he didn’t have much experience in a fight. He didn’t practice his cultivation technique or martial techniques much, but his real means of attack was through music dao!

With his mental energy at the sixth-grade Saint Spiritualist and Noble Tone, he was confident that he could kill Lin Yun. When his hands fell onto the zither, he suddenly regained his confidence with fighting spirit blazing within his pupils.

“Musician?” Lin Yun smirked as a wisp of killing intent flashed within his pupils. Ever since he left the Ancient Barren Domain, this was the first time Lin Yun had revealed his killing intent, even though he was engaged in several fights.

Jiang Feng already got on his nerves after repeatedly provoking him. Did Jiang Feng really think that he didn’t have any temper? If it wasn’t because he had his reservations and wasn’t in his strongest state, he could easily kill Jiang Feng with one sword using his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

But even so, it wasn’t troublesome for him to kill Jiang Feng. Lin Yun had experienced countless fights with his life on the line, and many lives fell to his sword. The number of people who fell to his sword wasn’t something Jiang Feng could imagine, and he didn’t know where the latter got the confidence to act with such arrogance before him.

After Jiang Feng started to strum the zither, his pace kept increasing, and he played the Prairie Phoenix Fire. Sound waves flew out along Jiang Feng’s fingers as the surrounding temperature increased.

Each soundwave was a terrifying heatwave, but Lin Yun didn’t have any change on his face, and his footsteps started changing. He displayed unbelievable agility at this moment and was dancing like an immortal. When the soundwaves and flames swept over, he would either dodge or shatter them with a punch.

The power of an ancient musical score was terrifying. Lin Yun might seem to be in a dangerous position, like a small rift in the raging waves, but everyone gradually realized that Lin Yun was unharmed as time passed.

“What’s going on?”

“Shouldn’t Senior Brother Jiang’s Prairie Phoenix Fire be strong?”

“Yeah. He obtained first place earlier, and the Saint Elder even rewarded a Profound Saint Pellet to him.”

“Lin Yun’s movements seem to match the rhythm of the music. He seems more proficient in the Prairie Phoenix Fire than Senior Brother Jiang…”

“This is really weird…” It didn’t take long for someone to notice what was going on.

Jiang Feng’s face also changed with his pupils squinted. He began to increase his pace as the flames manifested into a phoenix. As the phoenix released a cry, it flapped its wings and the phoenix gave off a feeling that it could incinerate everything in the world.

River flowing through the barren mountain, and wind rustling the fallen leaves. I rise and dance; with my shadow, I play!

Lin Yun was comprehending the Prairie Phoenix Fire that belonged to him. He suddenly moved as he raised his head when the phoenix dashed over.

As flames reflected his rage, boundless flames blazed within his pupils, and a hundred thousand dragon runes started gathering toward his palm. As lightning and wind poured towards his palm, a silver vortex appeared. He had executed an ancient secret technique, the Azure Dragon Grasp!

“Come!” Lin Yun waved his hand, and the phoenix was devoured by the vortex in his palm when it got close. When he clenched his fist, the phoenix disappeared, despite the flames still around in the surrounding area. The zither was still being played but was filled with irritation without any rhythm.

“What’s going on?” Jiang Feng was dumbfounded when he raised his head.

Everyone in the surroundings had shocked faces because this was too unbelieavable. After all, to devour a phoenix just by spreading his hand apart. This was an ancient musical score phenomenon comparable to a low-grade ghost spirit martial technique.

Further away, the Ancient Saint Clan’s disciples, like Zhang Mu and others, were also surprised when they saw this scene. When they recovered from the shock, Lin Yun opened his palm and pushed out. A newborn phoenix flew out from his palm, and each feather had undergone the temperament of thunderstorms, becoming silver and a lot stronger than before.

As a phoenix cry echoed that made the sky tremble, Jiang Feng threw out a mouthful of blood, and all the zither’s strings present snapped under the phoenix's cry. When the phoenix flew out, it circled a small portion of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

At this moment, many disciples were shocked to discover that the strings of their instruments had snapped. As for those who were playing the flute, they were astonished to discover that their musical tone was messed up.

“Nine Heavens Phoenix Cry?” Many elders were shocked as they looked toward the Saint Altar. After all, this was something that could only be achieved if one had a certain attainment in music dao.

“Mhm?” Mu Xueling, who had already left the Saint Altar, suddenly turned around with shock filling her pupils.

Back to the Saint Altar, the silver flaming phoenix enveloped in raging flames slammed against Jiang Feng. As a result of the clash, Jiang Feng was sent flying away and was covered with burns.

“Come here!” Lin Yun waved his hand and dragged Jiang Feng over.

Before Jiang Feng could react, Lin Yun had already slapped him. The slap was resounding, and everyone clearly heard it. The slap made Jiang Feng throw out a mouthful of blood as he spun around mid-air before falling to the ground.

“Is that all you got?” Lin Yun coldly looked at Jiang Feng.

“Lin Xiao, you’re dead! No one can save you today!” Jiang Feng staggered back to his feet, and his pupils were filled with boundless rage when he looked at Lin Yun. He couldn’t believe that Lin Yun dared to slap him in public, which was an act of courting death in his eyes.

But Lin Yun suddenly appeared before him with a flash.

“What are you trying to do?” Jiang Feng was horrified, and his voice was trembling.

“Cripple you!”

“Hahaha! Even if I give you a hundred guts, do you dare to cripple me?” Jiang Feng laughed instead. His father was the Grand Elder of the Law Enforcement Hall, so his position in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion was only second to the Saint Elder.

Even the descendants of the Ancient Saint Clans had to give him some face upon seeing him. So who did Lin Xiao think he was?

“Why don’t you try and touch me?” Jiang Feng coldly looked at Lin Yun. He gritted his teeth, “Don’t cower if you have the guts!”

“Young Master Lin, don’t be impulsive!” Not far away, Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi’s faces changed when they heard their conversation, and they tried to persuade Lin Yun. They knew that Jiang Feng was trying to provoke Lin Yun on purpose, and Lin Yun would be doomed if he really dared to make a move against Jiang Feng.

“Why don’t I dare?” Lin Yun’s hand reached out like a claw with lightning flickering on his fingers, stabbing into Jiang Feng’s chest. His five fingers were like sharp blades that pierced into Jiang Feng’s body, causing blood to splash from the wound.

“ARGHHH!” Jiang Feng screamed out in pain, but it was futile, no matter how he struggled. As the dragon aura from Lin Yun exploded, the thunderstorm energy crushed the five dragon pulses within Jiang Feng’s body.

Very quickly, Jiang Feng was like a ragdoll lying on the ground. Everyone in the surroundings was shocked, and their faces were changing drastically, but all of them had their mouths widened and couldn’t utter a single word. When their gazes fell on Lin Yun, they were speechless from the shock they felt because he really crippled Jiang Feng. Even Zhang Mu and the others were shocked by Lin Yun’s performance.

“No, no…” Jiang Feng used his hands to push his body up from the ground and muttered, seeming like he had gone insane. Then, he suddenly raised his head, “You bastard! ARGGHHH!”

But before he could do anything, Lin Yun stomped on his fingers, crushing all five fingers. This startled everyone even more and they exclaimed while covering their mouths. They could hear the sound of Jiang Feng’s finger bones being crushed.

But Lin Yun ignored the surrounding gazes and stomped his foot again, crushing Jiang Feng’s fingers on the other hand. As the saying goes, the ten fingers were connected to the heart. With all ten fingers crushed, the painful scream from Jiang Feng made everyone feel a chill run down their spines and their backs became covered in a cold sweat.

Lin Yun was too ruthless. Jiang Feng had become a thorough cripple now.

Right then, ten-odd figures descended from the sky. The Law-Enforcing Elders of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion had arrived, and they were all shocked when they saw this scene.

“Lin Xiao, how dare you! Are you courting death? How dare you cripple the disciple of my Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion!” The Law-Enforcing Elder who led the party roared as he looked at Lin Yun. With Jiang Feng suffering such injuries, he couldn’t imagine how furious his father, Jiang Yu, would become.

“Bring him back to the Law Enforcement Hall. Any punishment will be decided after my arrival, and no one is allowed to touch him before that!” Just when the elders wanted to cripple Lin Yun, Mu Xueling’s voice echoed from the summit of the snowy mountain.

Hearing that, the Law-Enforcing Elders were helpless and could only bring Lin Yun away as per Mu Xueling’s instructions. On the other hand, Lin Yun was calm as he allowed himself to be brought away by the elders.

“Quick, go and look for Weiwei!” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi exchanged glances, and they both had anxious expressions. They never expected Lin Yun to be so staunch, immediately crippling Jiang Feng without leaving any leeway for himself.

But they didn’t know Lin Yun had already gone easy on Jiang Feng. After all, he had ignored Jiang Feng’s repeated provocations until the latter crossed his bottom line. He even slew a Great Saint before, so Jiang Feng was naturally a nobody in his eyes.
