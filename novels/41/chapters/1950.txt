Chapter 1951 - I Hate Swordsmen!

Lin Yun smashed onto the ground with a loud sound. The ground cracks with a cloud of dust rising to the sky. Lin Yun was covered in excruciating pain all over his body, and his bones felt like they were on the verge of breaking. When he raised his head, the world spun with afterimages appearing in the surrounding scenery.

“How ruthless! Senior Brother is too ruthless!” Lin Yun held onto his head, feeling dizzy as he nearly fell to death. When his vision became clear, he discovered that he was on a barren mountain.

The moon shone brightly in the sky, and a blood-colored wolf stood upright before him, coldly staring at him from a distance. There was silver fur on the wolf’s forehead in the shape of a crescent moon pattern.

The wolf was surrounded by multiple demonic wolves coldly looking at Lin Yun with crimson pupils. The blood-colored wolf was enveloped in a saint aura, and Lin Yun’s heartbeat accelerated when the wolf looked at him.

He knew that his senior brother didn’t lie to him, and this was really a Quasi-Saint Realm demonic beast. As for the demonic wolves around it, they were practically at the Nirvana Stage.

“The… Blood… Rune Fruit…” The blood wolf spoke in human language, staring at Lin Yun. This was a monarch demonic beast, not to mention it had a cultivation at the Quasi-Saint Realm.

So Lin Yun could only deal with this blood wolf using his Sovereign Saint Artifact. But even so, he was in a dangerous situation because the pack of wolves would surround him if he failed to kill the blood wolf with the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

“He’s the one who stole my saint fruit! Kill him!” The blood wolf didn’t give Lin Yun a chance to explain and firmly insisted that Lin Yun stole the Blood Rune Fruit.

The pack of wolves howled, and they traveled across a few thousand meters in the blink of an eye. The demonic wolves were massive, with a size of over ten feet, and they could easily cover the bright moon in the sky if they leaped into the air. Not to mention that they were all at the Nirvana Stage, which meant they had swift speed and sharp claws.

The wolf pack gave Lin Yun immense pressure when the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf didn’t make a move. If the alpha wolf made a move, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Lin Yun maintained his calm composure and executed the Divine Sunchasing Art, leaving behind afterimages amongst the wolf pack. At the same time, dragon roars echoed as blue-jade and golden-purple dragon runes bloomed with two dragons coiling around him.

In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun exchanged a few hundred moves with the wolf pack. But there were simply too many of them, and only a few dozen attacked him while the others formed rings around him.

Lin Yun faced the wolf pack with the Sovereign Dragon Fist, and dragon roars accompanied his punches. Even if the wolves had a strong defense, they were immobilized when falling to the ground. But there were simply too many of them, and new wolves would charge forth, continuously attacking Lin Yun.

Looking afar, Lin Yun looked like an ancient beast, and his vitality was even more potent than the wolves. Then again, the attacks have shattered the dragon runes around his body, tearing through his defenses and leaving behind wounds on his body.

“Damn it!” Lin Yun’s pupils flashed with murderous intent, and he released his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at complete mastery. The surrounding demonic beasts were sent flying away, and his sword intent covered those demonic beasts in holes.

Lin Yun spread his arms apart and threw punches that were like swords, and a wolf took a punch right in its chest before it could even respond. With his punch empowered by the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, that wolf was instantly knocked flying away with a massive hole in its chest, lying on the ground dead.

In just a brief moment, ten-odd wolves were dead, and Lin Yun’s attacks were lethal under the empowerment of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. But when the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf roared, more demonic wolves dashed forth, and more demonic beasts appeared in the surroundings.

This scene made the corner of his lips twitch because he couldn’t bear the exhaustion, even with his two saint physiques. Looking at ten-odd demonic wolves dashing over, Lin Yun hovered in the air as he watched the demonic wolves charging over.

This surprised the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf, wondering what Lin Yun was trying to do. But he knew it in the next moment as flames blazed within Lin Yun’s pupils and a dazzling sword ray swept out from him, turning into a pillar that soared to the sky, shattering the layers of heaven and enveloping Lin Yun in a dazzling radiance.

“Astral Sword Intent…” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf stared at Lin Yun’s forehead.

The Astral Sword Intent pierced the ten-odd demonic wolves before they could respond and collapsed onto the ground. This made the other demonic wolves fearful, and they quickly stopped.

“Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf, I believe there’s a misunderstanding between us. Give me some time, and I can return you the seed,” Lin Yun said, hovering in the air as he radiated with sword rays. The flames were blazing brightly in his pupils, which looked like swords hidden in the depth of his pupils.

The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf rose on his two feet and stood like a human before he sneered, “There’s no misunderstanding. Since you’ve consumed the Blood Rune Fruit, the medicinal effect is still within your body. I still have time as long as I devour you before the full moon.

“You think you’re qualified to negotiate with me with your Astral Sword Intent?” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf dashed forth. Its speed was so fast that Lin Yun couldn’t follow it with his naked eyes, and it was blurred even if he used his Azure Dragon Sword Heart.

Lin Yun’s face changed, and was surprised because he didn’t expect it to be so terrifying when facing a Quasi-Saint Realm head-on, and he had underestimated the danger of this fight.

When Lin Yun was thinking about a solution, a sword vibration echoed with a sword ray flying out. The Flower Burial Sword disappeared before Lin Yun, forcing the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf to show itself. The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf was barely a hundred meters away, making Lin Yun’s face change as he spread his arms and retreated.

“You want to stop me with your sword? Get lost!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf’s laughter roared, and the Flower Burial Sword was knocked flying away with its claw.

The Flower Burial Sword only managed to buy Lin Yun a brief moment, but it was more than enough. As Lin Yun retreated, he raised his hands and formed a saint seal. The glory spirits in the Flower Burial Sword were activated, and it flew back with ten times the speed.

Lin Yun soared to the sky and formed a seal with his hands, and the Iris Saint Seal appeared at the back of his hands. Netherflowers also flew out from him, and the star flew out from his forehead with the flames of the star landing on the Netherflowers.

As the flames blazed on the Netherflowers, the flowers shone brightly as Lin Yun flicked his fingers, and the ignited Netherflowers condensed into swords before charging towards the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf.

The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf let out a roar, clashing with the Flower Burial Sword while smacking away the incoming swords. When the swords were knocked away and fell to the ground, the black aura emitted from the swords corroded the life force in the surrounding area, creating multiple patches of land with no life force.

As the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf became rampant, it dashed forth and slowly pushed back the Flower Burial Sword.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun hovered in the air with his hair fluttering, and he retreated while he flicked his fingers as though he was playing the piano.

A sword vibration echoed within the valley, clashing with the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf’s claws. It sounded like horses galloping on the field. The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf wasn’t initially bothered because it didn’t place the Flower Burial Sword and the incoming swords in its eyes. But it gradually began to sense that something wasn’t right.

The Flower Burial Sword attacked as though someone was controlling it, performing a profound sword technique. Not to mention that this sword technique was further empowered by the glory spirits, dying the sky in red.

Ultimately, the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf could no longer fend off the ignited swords and those swords plunged into its body. The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf instantly responded by wanting to rely on its cultivation to recover. Still, it was horrified to discover that its saint aura could expel the Astral Sword Intent but not the death energy contained within those swords. The swords were like poisonous needles, and this sped up the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf’s exhaustion of saint aura.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“I hate swordsmen!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf grimaced its fangs with a rage of flames blazing within its pupils and suddenly reached out to grab the Flower Burial Sword.
