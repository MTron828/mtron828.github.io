Chapter 2091 - Danger

After Wang Muyan left the Heavenly Dao Sect, she turned into a crimson streak of light and disappeared into the night.

A moment later, a lightning bolt flashed and tore through the sky. The sky tonight was scary, and heavy rain would pour at any moment.

Behind the Heavenly Dao Sect was a mountain range with demonic beasts, and Lin Yun had trained here in the past, fighting a demonic beast that was at the Quasi-Saint Realm. This mountain range had towering mountains that looked sinister with lightning that looked like ferocious beasts as they tore through the sky.

At the summit of a mountain was a tattered palace with a man and woman standing before it. The man was donning a yellow robe with a golden mark on his forehead, while the woman was donning a red dress with a crimson mark on her forehead. There were special runes on their clothes that contained an ancient aura, giving them a weird appearance.

Suddenly, their eyes shone and a crimson moon appeared from within the depths of their pupils as they raised their heads. As a crimson radiance bloomed, an enchanting fragrance blew over as a woman wearing revealing clothes appeared before them. When they saw Wang Muyan, they respectfully bowed, “We pay our respects to the Divine Maiden!”

Then, the door of the tattered palace was pushed open and a handsome youth came out. This youth had exquisite features and was walking towards Wang Muyan.

“I have been waiting for you for a long time,” the youth smiled. When lightning ripped through the sky, the sudden flash of light further outlined the youth's features. “You two wait here. I have something to discuss with the Divine Maiden.”

““Understood.””

The youth and Wang Muyan walked into the tattered palace. The roof of this palace was heavily damaged, with old paintings decorating the walls. The wall seemed to be a record of some ceremony, but a huge part was missing. All that remained was the painting of a crimson moon that looked striking.

Wang Muyan looked at the crimson moon with a hint of light shining within her eyes, different from her usual enchanting temperament.

“Who could’ve thought that there’s a base of the Blood Moon Sect so close the Heavenly Dao Sect? I’ve just cleaned the chair.” The youth spoke in a gentle tone. He had a strong masculine charm that was tough for any ordinary woman to resist.

But Wang Muyan’s eyes were cold, with no intention of responding. Her attention was on the paintings.

The youth merely smiled and wasn’t bothered by this. He walked to the side and took out an exquisite tea set. While he was boiling a pot of tea, he looked like he came out of a picture, with every movement looking artistic. The tea’s fragrance didn’t take long to spread throughout the tattered palace.

“Muyan, come and have some tea. I specially prepared this Obscure Moon Tea for you,” the youth smiled.

Wang Muyan walked over and picked up the teacup without any expression, taking a small sip before a few more sips. The youth noticed this, and his smile grew denser.

But when Wang Muyan put down the cup, she said, “That person has returned.”

“Ye Qingtian? I know him,” the youth said.

“He’s a troublesome figure to deal with. He is talented and has a good relationship with three Great Saints of the Heavenly Dao Sect, and he has been suspecting me for some time now.” Wang Muyan nodded.

“So what? No one can touch the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden without any evidence. As for him, he’s only someone at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. Even if he manages to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm within six months, he still wouldn’t affect our plan,” the youth smiled.

“We have to ensure that nothing goes wrong,” Wang Muyan said.

“You’re that worried about him? I remember that he has failed to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. So even if he’s talented, his cultivation will be severely hindered,” the youth frowned.

“He didn’t fail. He must’ve given up on purpose. I’ve been observing him, and he didn’t look like he failed,” Wang Muyan said.

“Then there’s nothing to worry about. He must be afraid since he gave up, and fear will affect his future cultivation. It will be hard for him to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage or Quasi-Saint Realm in the future,” the youth said.

“Don’t underestimate him. He’s not that simple. If he still has other means, the plan that the divine cult prepared for so many years might fail,” Wang Muyan shook her head.

The youth’s gaze changed, and he said, “Then don’t start a conflict with him. It’s not an issue if he doesn’t affect our plan.”

“I doubt it’ll be that easy.” Wang Muyan didn’t hold any hope in his words.

“Does he have other identities?” The youth asked.

Wang Muyan momentarily hesitated, but she decided to not share her speculation. The youth naturally noticed that, and he fell into deep thoughts, thinking there was something else he didn’t know.

Suddenly, the youth raised his brow with murderous intent sweeping from him. He then pointed his finger, and the wall before him crumbled, revealing a person. This person was the Heavenly Dao Sect’s Golden Guard, Bai Xiao!

Bai Xiao was tasked with examining Wang Muyan, but he couldn’t find any useful evidence. He finally found some evidence today, and he was shocked when he tapped into their conversation because Wang Muyan was the Blood Moon Sect’s Divine Maiden!ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Lin Yun previously speculated that Wang Muyan might be a holy maiden, but it looked like Wang Muyan’s status was even higher than he had imagined. Bai Xiao was shocked when he heard that they’d been planning something for decades.

“This fellow is strong!” Bai Xiao’s eyes flashed with fear as he looked at the youth. The youth’s eyes occasionally flashed with a purple light that looked like blooming lightning.

Bai Xiao had long reached the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm, and he had even grasped a secret technique that could conceal his aura from even a Saint Realm expert.

The youth wasn’t at the Saint Realm, and he was young. Thus, Bai Xiao speculated that this young man might be the Divine Son of the Blood Moon Sect. After thinking that, Bai Xiao could feel his scalp going numb.

“Holy shit. Wang Muyan is the Blood Moon Divine Maiden. What relationship does the Wang Clan have with the Blood Moon Sect? Not to mention that the Blood Moon Divine Son is also involved in this matter. I have to go back first.” Bai Xiao held a golden bead, recording the conversation between Wang Muyan and the youth. Since he had already obtained the evidence he wanted, he no longer needed to stay here.

Executing his movement technique, Bai Xiao turned into a streak of light and disappeared into the night. The man and woman standing outside the palace quickly chased after him. The yellow-clothed man disappeared and reappeared before Bai Xiao in the next moment.

Bai Xiao and this yellow-clothed man circulated their saint auras, and their palms clashed before they retreated.

“Yellowclothed Venerable!” Bai Xiao frowned. He recognized this person as one of the seven Venerables of the Blood Moon Sect. As for the other person, it was obvious that she was the Bloodclothed Venerable of the seven Venerables.

The Bloodclothed Venerable reached out, grasping flames that enveloped Bai Xiao.

Bai Xiao was startled as he retreated to the tattered palace.

“You think you can escape?” The Bloodclothed Venerable smiled and charged at Bai Xiao with the Yellowclothed Venerable.

The three exchanged over ten-odd moves. Bai Xiao swung his sword, causing a violent gale that forced the two venerables back. Bai Xiao was part of the strongest batch of the Golden Guard, aside from Quasi-Saints at the Heavenly Origin Phase. He was only a hundred years old and had a high chance of reaching the Saint Realm in the future. After forcing the two back, Bai Xiao no longer stayed there and fled.

“Get over here!” The youth in the palace roared with terrifying indigo radiance shining within his eyes.

As thunder rumbled in the sky, there was a sudden downpour before purple light shone from the youth’s pupils and the lightning in the sky manifested into a palm. The lightning palm pierced through Bai Xiao’s chest before grabbing onto his heart, crushing it.

“The Indigo Lightning Eyes… You’re really the Divine Son.” Bai Xiao fell to the ground with his vitality leaving him.

The youth waved his hand and grabbed the golden bead before crushing it. He smiled, “Muyan, you go back first. I will pay attention to Ye Qingtian and find a way to deal with him. As for the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, you don’t have to worry about it.”

Wang Muyan calmly looked at Bai Xiao’s corpse before she turned into a crimson streak, disappearing into the night.

Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple were traveling in the mountain range together.

“The thunder is really loud, and it sounds scary,” Lil’ Purple softly said as she looked at the lightning in the sky. The two came here, chasing after the scent left behind by Wang Muyan, but they were lost in the mountain range, unable to determine Wang Muyan’s exact location. They’ve been going back and forth here for a long time.

“That is…!” A lightning bolt streaked across the horizon, illuminating a lofty mountain with a pale-faced figure on it.

“That’s someone from the Heavenly Dao Sect. Give me the mask,” Lin Yun didn’t see that person’s face, but he should be a member of the Heavenly Dao Sect, judging from his clothes. So he took the Silvermoon Mask from Lil’ Purple without hesitation before executing the Divine Sunchasing Art and flew over.

When he got close to the mountain, he could sense the lingering saint aura in the atmosphere, so there should’ve been a fight between Quasi-Saints. At the same time, he could smell a stench of blood coming from the top[ of the mountain.

After Lin Yun climbed the mountain, his face changed when he saw Bai Xiao. There was a hole in Bai Xiao’s chest with blood flowing out, and this made him take a deep breath because Bai Xiao was heavily injured. He quickly approached and grabbed Bai Xiao’s wrist before heaving a sigh of relief, sensing that he was still alive. Bai Xiao was heavily injured, but he could still be saved. His pale face gradually became rosy as Lin Yun poured his blue dragon aura into Bai Xiao’s body.

Bai Xiao looked anxious, wanting to raise his hand, but Lin Yun stopped him because Bai Xiao wasn’t in good condition. So he shouldn’t move around right now.

“T-There’s someone behind you…” Bai Xiao struggled to speak.

His words made Lin Yun feel a chill behind him, as if a viper was staring at him. In the next moment, a shortsword enveloped in crimson flames flew over.
