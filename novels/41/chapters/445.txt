Chapter 446 - Underdog Appears

Lin Yun’s words were like a bolt of lightning that rumbled in everyone’s heart. All of them were too shocked to utter a word. They still couldn’t believe that the once in a millennia genius from the Sword Cloud Pavilion died just like that from Lin Yun’s sword.

Just a second ago, Twilight was still declaring that Lin Yun would die if he didn’t surrender. But in the next second, he was severed into pieces. His strongest attack was completely crushed when the Iris Flower bloomed. His attack couldn’t even put up any resistance before Lin Yun.

Many people still couldn’t accept that Twilight had died. However, if they were to calm down and think about it, they would realize that Lin Yun was never in the disadvantageous position throughout the fight. No matter how ferocious Twilight's attack was, Lin Yun was always calm and composed.

On the other hand, Lin Yun began to gain the upper hand in the fight when he revealed his cultivation in the tenth stage. Everyone would soon realize that the level of their swords weren’t on the same level.

The power of the Aquaselenic Sword had been entirely brought out under the brilliant moon. The outcome was decided once that happened.

In the spectators' seats, Qin Yu’s face changed. He was just as shocked as the crowd had been. His emotions were going for a rollercoaster ride and he couldn’t calm himself down.

In his view, there was no way Lin Yun could be compared to the eight titles no matter how strong he was. In fact, there was no way Lin Yun could pose any threat to him. However, everything changed once Twilight was killed by Lin Yun. Just what did Lin Yun do for the past three days?

Even after Lin Yun sheathed his sword, his sword intent lingered on the stage. At this moment, his aura had reached the pinnacle. He gave everyone the impression of being arrogant and overbearing when he slew Twilight. However, Lin Yun didn’t do that on purpose, it was just a part of his nature.

He was Lin Yun, not a toy for the titled figures. The so-called titles weren’t that impressive in his eyes, so killing Twilight had merely exposed Lin Yun’s ambition. He was here for the championship and three years were too long for him to wait.

When he noticed Qin Yu looking at him, he looked back at Qin Yu coldly. He had never intended on avoiding Qin Yu in this competition. Qin Yu wanted to kill him and he also wanted to kill Qin Yu. He was practically certain that Qin Yu was the mastermind behind Xin Jue’s death and that Wang Yan was just a lackey.

Everyone knew about this allegation, but no one dared to say it out loud because Qin Yu was the heir to the throne. But that didn’t bother Lin Yun. Since death wasn’t a surprise in the competition, he would get revenge for Xin Jue’s death as well as get back Xin Yan’s surname.

The two of their gazes clashed in the air and the intensity made many people swallow their saliva. Anyone could tell that their clash was inevitable, but until today, no one felt that Lin Yun could threaten Qin Yu. However, after his performance against Twilight, it seemed like Lin Yun had a chance.

“Impudent,” sneered Qin Yu. If Lin Yun thinks he can fight me because he killed Twilight, then he’s being ignorant.

The battles continued, but the shock from Twilight’s death lingered in everyone’s heart. The faces of the Sword Cloud Pavilion’s elders were also dark. Both Luo Yuhang and Twilight had died to Lin Yun, which made them feel like they were cursed. The Sword Firmament Pavilion was still the Sword Firmament Pavilion and there was no way they could stand out with the Sword Firmament Pavilion around.

“The tenth battle, the Demonic Moon Villa’s Aquaselenic VS the Heavenly Profound Sect’s Su Yan!”

Aquaselenic was the only female among the titles and her sword was smooth and clear like the moon. She had already reached a high attainment in the Cloudmist Sword a long time ago. She had an outstanding appearance and her temperament underwent a total transformation when she unleashed her sword aura.

It seemed like she was unleashing an endless cold wind. She didn’t even use the Cloudmist Sword that she was famous for. On the contrary, she used a domineering sword technique to suppress her opponent. Because she fought in this way, she didn’t seem like a woman. Through her domination, there was no suspense and Su Yan surrendered after taking a few swords.

The Heavenly Profound Sect’s performance in this competition was terrible, unlike in the previous one. This made everyone begin to doubt them. On the contrary, the Sword Firmament Pavilion had two underdogs.

When Trueorigin went on the stage and killed his opponent in three punches, this made the entire atmosphere grow silent. Many people knew that the Heavenly Profound Sect couldn’t take it anymore and the elders would become anxious if Trueorigin didn’t show a strong front.

“The thirteenth battle, the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Ye Feng VS the Hundred Beast Gate’s Feng Ye!”

Upon hearing the princess’ announcement, Luo Feng instructed, “Be careful. Don’t underestimate Feng Ye.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He was in a rather good mood since both Bai Lixuan and Lin Yun made it to the top sixteen, not to mention that Lin Yun even killed Twilight. If Feng Ye could make it into the top sixteen, then the Sword Firmament Pavilion would have a satisfactory performance in this competition.

“Don’t worry. I’ll win for sure.” Ye Feng also felt pent up from how Lin Yun stole the limelight. If he couldn’t defeat Feng Ye, then he would be totally embarrassed. But he was rather confident about winning since he was in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm. It was more than enough to suppress that barbarian.

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s momentum seems strong. But I wonder how strong you are?” grinned Feng Ye.

“Why don’t you come and try,” replied Ye Feng.

“So be it,” laughed Feng Ye as he dashed forward.

Although Ye Feng told his opponent to come and try, he instantly brought out his ultimate move. Normally, this would seem despicable, but this was the Dragon Gate Competition. As long as he could win, nothing else mattered.

When Feng Ye came over, the sword in Ye Feng’s hand started dancing like a whip, manifesting itself into countless swords that enveloped Feng Ye.

“You!” cursed Feng Ye. An azure radiance soon burst out from his body and enveloped him. Meanwhile, he threw both his fists forward. Every single one of his punches were accompanied with great power, which made the entire stage tremble. But despite this, he wasn’t able to land any hits on Ye Feng.

What thick skin this barbarian has! Ye Feng frowned his brows. He never expected that Feng Ye would have such a shocking defence. It felt like he was hitting a mountain made of metal.

“Hehe, caught you!” Feng Ye grinned and he threw out a punch. This punch had instantly locked onto Ye Feng, so there was no way Ye Feng could avoid this attack.

A barbarian will always be a barbarian. Can’t you see that I’m giving you an opportunity on purpose? Ye Feng sneered inwardly. He suddenly retracted his aura and stabbed his sword at Feng Ye. The sword aura coming from him also enveloped Feng Ye in an instant.

“Ye Feng was actually holding back all along!”

“With his cultivation, it’s impossible for him not to injure Feng Ye.”

“This Feng Ye was too impatient.” Many people noticed Ye Feng’s tricks, so they shook their heads. Coming this far, there was no longer any suspense in their fight.

Only Lin Yun had his brows tightly knitted. Feng Ye might be irritable, but he didn’t seem to be such a reckless fellow in his memory. This meant that there was something unusual going on in the fight.

Suddenly, a huge explosion rang out from the stage, which instantly robbed everyone of their hearing for a short moment. Many people even fainted from the explosion.

Ten cauldron’s worth of strength! Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard the explosions.

Shortly after, Ye Feng was blown out with his chest caved in. When he fell onto the ground, he threw up a few mouthfuls of blood and nearly fainted. Raising his head, he could see Feng Ye looking at him with a grin.

“You fooled me!” Ye Feng said with his teeth gnashed. He would’ve surrendered immediately if he knew that his opponent had ten cauldron’s worth of strength. After all, only Heartcliff had such a terrifying strength in the entire capital.

“So what? Killing you is just as easy as raising my hand,” smiled Feng Ye.

Ye Feng was immediately terrified, so he got up on his feet and jumped off the stage, “I surrender.”

When he turned back, he noticed that Feng Ye didn’t even flinch. He only stood in the same spot with a mocking smile, which instantly made Ye Feng’s face turn black.

At this moment, everyone knew that there was another underdog. This competition was a lot more intense than the previous ones. After all, who would have thought that Feng Ye’s brute strength was comparable to Heartcliff.

“The fourteenth battle, the Demonic Moon Villa’s Situ Yi VS the Heavenly Qin Institute’s Everluck!” The next match instantly caused another commotion because everyone was also looking forward to this fight.

In the beginning, no one was optimistic of Situ Yi’s chances. However, after Lin Yun had defeated Twilight, they couldn’t help but wonder if Situ Yi could also win.
