Chapter 617 - The Old and New Generations

As time gradually passed, those at the border of the Withernorth Sea were waiting anxiously. Ever since Xie Yunqiao was eliminated, a long time had passed without any other eliminations. This made everyone extremely nervous.

“There are only six people left, Lin Yun, Bai Lixuan, Qin An, Pei Yue, Yan Kong, and Ji Wuye. Surely someone will be eliminated on the eighth level.”

“In terms of strength, there’s a high possibility of Lin Yun or Bai Lixuan being eliminated.”

“Those two can be proud of their achievements. After all, many elites on the ranking didn’t make it through the sixth level. It really wasn’t easy for them to get this far.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Indeed, those geniuses appearing recently are getting stronger. Looks like the Draconic Banquet will be interesting.”

The closer everyone got to the ninth level, the more intense the competition would become. All the crowd could do now was guess who would be eliminated next. While they were discussing things, someone was finally teleported out. Everyone quickly turned to look at who was eliminated.

But when they saw two figures walking out from the sandstorm, all of them exclaimed, especially after seeing the wounds on their bodies. “Qin An! Pei Yue!”

“What heavy injuries…”

“I heard the Cloud Trigram Sect’s disciples saying that they joined hands to eliminate Xie Yunqiao.”

“So you’re saying that the person who eliminated these two fought them at the same time? Who is strong enough to face two monsters on the top ten of the outer ranking at once?”

“It has to be either Ji Wuye or Yan Kong. They’re really strong.” No one felt that anyone else could achieve this besides Yan Kong and Ji Wuye. They could imagine how brutal the fight must’ve been from Pei Yue and Qin An’s injuries.

“What serious injuries!” Many people sucked in a cold breath when Pei Yue and Qin An got closer. It was a miracle that the two were still alive right now.

Pei Yue and Qin An’s faces were ugly when they heard that. They came out immediately after Bai Lixuan left, fearing that they might run into Ji Wuye or Yan Kong. When they tried the ninth trial, they were naturally eliminated from a single exchange. They already expected that someone would try to ask them questions, but they were determined not to speak.

“Lin Yun still isn’t out…” Those from the Heavenly Province Academy’s expression became even more nervous. It had exceeded their expectation that Lin Yun could come this far, especially Zhang Yuan who wore an extremely complicated expression.

“Elder Tang, I have a feeling that Lin Yun did this to them…” Mo Ling spoke out right at this moment, which caught everyone by surprise.

Lin Yun did this to them? Wasn’t it a little too exaggerating to say that he defeated two monsters on the top ten of the ranking with his cultivation in the Yang stage? One must know that Xie Yunqiao’s xiantian sword intent was also in greater mastery, but even he was defeated by Pei Yue and Qin An.

“This is only a guess of mine. Their injuries look to be caused by the Flower Burial Sword. Yan Kong and Ji Wuye are both known as Ghost Blade and Bloody Butcher. The former uses a saber, while the latter focuses on his killing aura and bloodlust,” said Mo Ling as she continued, “But their injuries are purely from sword intent without any killing aura.”

Hearing her analysis, the eyes of Zhang Yuan and the rest lit up because her words made sense

On the other hand, everyone from the Bloodwing Pavilion was also discussing Lin Yun with a completely different mood. “That bastard still isn’t out yet?”

“Not only did he kill the disciple of Nethercloud Ghost, but he even killed the chief disciple of our sect. This is simply outrageous!”

“We have to take revenge even if the academy stands behind him!” The Bloodwing Pavilion naturally found out that Lin Yun was the murderer of Leng Haoyu, especially since everything took place in front of many eyes.

The elders of the Bloodwing Pavilion were filled with rage, especially Leng Haoyu’s master Elder Ma Yu, who was the Heavenly Soul Realm expert leading the party. His face was dark and he had been waiting for Lin Yun a long time.

But right now, the focus of the various sects were on Qin An and Pei Yue. Everyone noticed something fishy about the wounds that were purely caused by sword intent. This meant that their speculation was wrong, which instantly caused a commotion. Only Bai Lixuan and Lin Yun could leave such injuries on them. Regardless of who did it, the news was shocking.

These two represented the rise of the new generation, which justified their shock. Additionally, Lin Yun who was only eighteen.

“I feel that it must be Bai Lixuan. After all, he possesses the Saint Physique and not many people can be compared to him in the entire Ancient Southern Domain.”

“But it might also be Lin Yun. Don’t forget that he even dared to face Ji Wuye. He must have had the confidence to do that.”

“That’s right. Even Bai Lixuan’s senior brother lost to Qin An and Pei Yue.”

“Don’t be so sure about it. How do you know that Bai Lixuan doesn't have a hidden trump card?”

Qin An and Pei Yue’s faces were ugly when they heard the surrounding discussion. They came here confidently for the empyrean’s legacy and they never imagined that they would suffer such humiliation right now.

Everyone turned their gazes towards Qin An and Pei Yue, wanting to know who had eliminated them. But right at this moment, two figures walked out of the sandstorm that caused another commotion. The figures were Yan Kong and Bai Lixuan. After them, there wasn't anyone else.

“This means that only Lin Yun and Ji Wuye are left on the ninth level…”

“So it really was Lin Yun!” Now, everyone was certain that Lin Yun eliminated Qin An and Pei Yue. This made things a lot more interesting.

There were only two people left. One was a monstrous genius who rose to fame four years ago. The other was a swordsman who had recently risen to fame. The battle between the two also represented the old and new generations, which left everyone in anticipation. The excitement was palpable especially since the Draconic Banquet was only eight months away.
