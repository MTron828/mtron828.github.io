Chapter 475 - Stop Right There!

Lin Yun felt warmth when he saw how many people were sending him off. Everyone had called him junior brother when he first joined and they protected him like a chick before the Gentlemen Union.

But now, the Gentlemen Union had dispersed and the junior brother that they once protected had now become the Dragon Gate Competition’s champion. At the same time, he also turned into their senior brother.

“Are you courting death?!” Ye Xinyan glared at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun knew that he was at fault, so he smiled, “Senior Sister, you’re so pretty today.”

“Tsk, when am I not pretty?” Ye Xinyan winked at him and then smiled, “What’s this? Do you fancy me now? If you flatter me again, I’ll consider it. How about it?”

“Consider what?” Lin Yun feigned ignorance.

“Take this!” Ye Xinyan laughed and she swung her horse whip at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun grabbed onto the whip and smiled, “Senior Sister, can you even bear to hit me?”

When he pulled the whip, Ye Xinyan was suddenly pulled over. This surprised Lin Yun and he caught Ye Xinyan in his embrace.

Now on the Dragon Blooded Horse, Ye Xinyan’s arms were around Lin Yun’s neck and the surroundings suddenly became quiet. This scene caught everyone by surprise when they saw the bashfulness on Ye Xinyan’s face.

“Holy shit!” Li Wuyou yelled out when he saw this scene. “Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!”

“Kiss!”

“Kiss!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Everyone copied Li Wuyou and yelled out excitedly. They knew that Ye Xinyan and Lin Yun’s relationship was like siblings. They had a special relationship that was somewhat ambiguous but at the same time not, because no one took the next step.

So they suddenly got excited when they saw this scene. After all, it was acceptable to them if Lin Yun and Ye Xinyan got together.

“You should let me go now, Junior Brother. Or are you really going to kiss me?” Ye Xinyan blushed even more, like a bright rose as she glared at Lin Yun.

“Senior Sister, how can I let you go if you keep hugging me?” smiled Lin Yun bitterly.

“You and your flippant mouth!” Ye Xinyan pinched Lin Yun’s neck and moved behind Lin Yun. Pulling the reins, Ye Xinyan said, “Let’s go.”

The Dragon Blooded Horse turned into an afterimage and disappeared from everyone’s eyes.

“Damn it. That bastard stole Senior Sister away… My heart hurts…” murmured Li Wuyou.

“Weren’t you yelling the loudest earlier?” Mo Chen glanced at Li Wuyou in disdain.

“B-but my heart still hurts…” pouted Li Wuyou.

“Haha, let’s go! Back to the mountain!” laughed Mo Chen. He stopped bothering himself with Li Wuyou and returned to the Sword Firmament Pavilion with everyone else.

When night came, the Dragon Blooded Horse slowed down. Lin Yun and Ye Xinyan had been chatting the whole way.

“Senior Sister, you’re not going back?” Lin Yun tried to find a topic. He started panicking when he felt Ye Xinyan’s soft body.

“I’m going to travel the world with you,” winked Ye Xinyan. But when she saw no response from Lin Yun, she laughed, “Alright, I was just teasing you. I don’t intend to return. The Ye Clan has regained their freedom, so I no longer have anything to worry about in the empire. I intend to go out and see the world.”

“Then we can stay together for some time,” replied Lin Yun.

“There are so many bad guys out there and I’m so pretty. So you have to protect me,” said Ye Xinyan.

“My sword won’t allow you to be hurt,” said Lin Yun confidently.

“You and your flippant mouth again!” smiled Ye Xinyan. Her beauty couldn’t be concealed by the darkness.

The sky gradually turned dark as Lin Yun and Ye Xinyan continued to talk. They talked about the times they spent in Locket Mountain and their past. Ye Xinyan never stopped laughing along the way.

But when dawn came, Lin Yun felt that something was amiss. He raised his head to look at the sky. It seemed like something was bothering him. Ye Xinyan tried asking him about it, but Lin Yun merely smiled and kept silent. However, while Lin Yun listened to Ye Xinyan, he would occasionally stare into the sky.

When night passed, Ye Xinyan woke up to see Lin Yun washing his face by the river. When Ye Xinyan went over, she saw Lin Yun staring at his own reflection.

“Junior Brother, do you know what today’s occasion is?” she asked.

Lin Yun was startled. He quickly finished washing his face and smiled, “What’s the occasion?”

“Today is the Bloomphoenix Princess’ ascension to the throne. Oh, wait a minute. Starting today, you have to call her Bloomphoenix Empress. Do you want to go and take a look?” Ye Xinyan looked at Lin Yun’s face. The moment she mentioned that the princess was ascending to the throne, the smile disappeared from Lin Yun’s face.

“Junior Brother, do you intend to lie to yourself even more?” smiled Ye Xinyan.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before his eyes flashed with resolution. “Senior Sister…”

“Get on.” Ye Xinyan disappeared and then reappeared on the Dragon Blooded Horse. Together with Lin Yun, the Dragon Blooded Horse sped towards the capital like a bolt of crimson lightning.

In barely two hours, the capital was visible to them. There was a long queue before the entrance because the princess was ascending the throne today.

“Don’t bother queuing. Sneak in. I’ll wait for you here.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun nodded and he disappeared through the city wall. With his current strength, it was naturally a piece of cake for him to jump over the city wall. But he didn’t see that Ye Xinyan was biting down on her lips on the Dragon Blooded Horse.

When Lin Yun made it over the wall, he turned into an azure blur as he traveled on the rooftops. He wore a grave expression. He didn’t forget that today was the Bloomphoenix Princess’s ascension, but he couldn’t see through her.

He didn’t know why she didn’t say anything when he became the champion and he wanted to know the Bloomphoenix Princess’ true identity.

It didn’t take long for the palace to appear before him. Today, the palace looked dignified and an ancient ceremonial music was coming from it. The guards were also a lot stricter today.

Lin Yun stood on a high building as he looked at the palace. He could see a slim figure wearing a gorgeous robe. She was slowly walking on a flight of stairs, with a throne at the end of it that represented authority.

Lin Yun hesitated if he should go in. It wasn’t because he didn’t have the courage, but he couldn’t be certain about the princess’ identity. If she wasn’t who he thought she was, then it would be too embarrassing. But what if she was?

Lin Yun ultimately decided to go. He didn’t want to give up even if there was a slim chance.

Tapping on the roof, he charged towards the palace.

“Intruder! Intruder!” The guards didn’t discover him, but the Divine Guards’ elites noticed him when he approached the first gate. They immediately charged at him.

“Stop!” A bark rang out just when the Divine Guards’ elites were about to charge forward. A familiar figure slowly appeared before Lin Yun, it was Yue Qing, who had also received a title in the competition. He instructed the elites, “Go back down. I’ll handle him. You guys are not his opponent.”

“Roger!” The Divine Guards were strict when it came to orders. So the moment that Yue Qing issued an order, they swiftly dispersed.

“You’re not my opponent. Get lost,” said Lin Yun as he looked at Yue Qing without any expression.

“The princess has orders that no one is to get close today. So I can’t back down.” Yue Qing waved his hand and he retrieved a long spear. In that split second, he emitted a powerful killing intent along with an aura in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm.

But before he could even do anything, a figure appeared before him. He was caught by surprise and was sent flying from just a palm.

When he fell onto the ground, he immediately turned around and saw the azure figure had already passed him. Wiping the blood off his lips, Yue Qing smiled bitterly, “I can’t even take a hit…”

“Hold it!” Another person stepped out to stop Lin Yun. This time, It was Egret, the Egret who lost to Qin Yu. Without a doubt, he was much stronger than Yue Qing.

They didn’t spare any nonsense and immediately clashed. But Egret soon lost after three moves. When he fell onto the ground, he wore a bitter face.

“The princess has orders. Anyone who intrudes is to be killed!” A cold voice rang out when Lin Yun reached the third gateway. This time, it was a Drifting Goblet.

His gaze was cold as he looked at Lin Yun, releasing an aura that belonged to the Violet Palace Realm. Lin Yun wasn’t shocked by it because he knew that Drifting Goblet had reached the Violet Palace Realm.

The Violet Palace Realm was divided into three stages, the Yin, Yang, and Yin-Yang Stage. Drifting Goblet should be in the lesser Yin stage. But even so, the aura coming from him far surpassed Erget and Yue Qing.

“Leave. I don’t wish to kill you,” said Drifting Goblet.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word and he gently patted his interspatial pouch. He then tossed out a jar of Monkey Wine.

“Damn it, who do you think I am?!” Drifting Goblet threw a punch out. But just when his fist was about to come into contact with the jar of wine, he suddenly cursed, “Damn it.”

He suddenly retracted his attack and explained, “Don’t think that you can bribe me with a jar of wine. The princess has orders…”

Before he could even finish, he saw jar after jar flying towards him. This instantly made him exclaim because he didn’t want to see them shatter. In the blink of an eye, ten jars had piled up on his chest. When he turned around, he saw that Lin Yun had already passed him.

“Forget it… Forget it…” A helpless smile appeared on Drifting Goblet’s face.

At the grand ceremony, the princess was slowly ascending the throne.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, a terrifying sword intent was released from him. In that split second, the music was disrupted and countless gazes were directed at him. But Lin Yun was staring at the figure walking towards the throne. Seeing that she was one step away from the throne, Lin Yun barked, “Su Ziyao, stop right there!”

His bark echoed, and the slim figure suddenly jolted when Lin Yun yelled out ‘Su Ziyao.’ Seeing this reaction, Lin Yun rejoiced because it was really her. He immediately sped over.
