Chapter 1998 - Three-Eyed Demonspirit!

“Ye Qingtian, you think Bai Qingyu can survive if you lure me away? That’s impossible, because both of you will die today!” Xiao Jingyan’s hair fluttered as he became enveloped in a demonic radiance.

Lin Yun didn’t choose to fight him head-on and continued to lure him away. This way, Bai Qingyu and Lil’ Red would be safe. He was worried because Bai Qingyu and Lil’ Red were injured, and they might be unable to leave the Myriad Graves Valley, even if he lured Xiao Jingyan away. He initially wanted to help Bai Qingyu treat her injuries, but he didn’t have the time.

Xiao Jingyan suddenly thought of something and smiled, changing his direction. Why should he waste time chasing after Ye Qingtian? Since Ye Qingtian was concerned about Bai Qingyu, he could just capture her. He pushed his movement speed to the limit. He chased after the escaping Ancient Dracoape, descending from the sky with his palm, sending the Ancient Dracoape and Bai Qingyu flying away.

Under the heavy blow, Lil’ Red returned to its cat form. Bai Qingyu also threw out a mouthful of blood, and her grave injuries worsened even more.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Descending Nether Orchid!” Bai Qingyu gritted her teeth and activated the Stalewater Sword at full force, wanting to inflict injuries on Xiao Jingyan. Even if she dies, she had to do something.

“Stop!” Lin Yun yelled when he saw this scene. In his eyes, Xiao Jingyan was an expert in the top thirty, and he wasn’t someone like Bai Qingyu could handle.

But everything was too late. Bai Qingyu might possess a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, but Xiao Jingyan’s pupils flashed with disdain, knowing she couldn’t even bring out the full force of it. Bai Qingyu lacked fighting experience.

Xiao Jingyan merely tilted his body to the side to avoid the incoming attack, before unleashing his attack when Bai Qingyu revealed her flaw. He clenched his fist and punched Bai Qingyu’s chest, disrupting Bai Qingyu’s nirvana aura.

The punch broke her ribs, and the impact injured her internal organs as she flew back like a broken kite. When she fell to the ground, she fainted from the pain, and her injuries were so serious that her vitality had nearly disappeared.

“Trash!” Xiao Jingyan seized the Stalewater Sword and mocked, “If you could have even brought out one-tenth of this sword’s power, I wouldn’t have dared to move against you. Let me use your beloved sword to end your life, then.”

Bai Qingyu had to die or he wouldn’t be able to stay in the Heavenly Dao Sect in the future if news of them trying to kill Ye Qingtian spread out. When Xiao Jingyan swung his sword, waves overlapped. This was a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact that many Quasi-Saints would risk their lives for. Even a Saint Lord would be willing to lower themselves to seize it.

“It’s mine now!” Xiao Jingyan laughed, swinging the sword down.

But Lin Yun finally arrived and clashed with the Stalewater Sword head-on. When the two swords clashed, Xiao Jingyan smiled, “I already guessed that you’d return. You tried to lure me away, but you’re forced to come back in the end. Do you feel foolish?”

“I’m a swordsman; I just have to be true to my heart,” Lin Yun smiled.

Xiao Jingyan mocked, “You can be true to your heart when you’re dead.”

“You wouldn’t understand,” Lin Yun smiled. He grabbed his sword with both hands and pushed Xiao Jingyan back.

“Leave with her.” Lin Yun grabbed Bai Qingyu and threw her over to Lil’ Red.

“Women are really troublesome.” Lil’ Red shook its head and left with Bai Qingyu.

“Do you guys think you can escape?” Xiao Jingyan chased after Lil’ Red again. His speed was fast, and he was bound to catch up since Lil’ Red was carrying someone.

But Lin Yun suddenly executed the Sword of the Beginning with the Flower Burial Sword, aimed at Xiao Jingyan’s back. This made Xiao Jingyan feel a heightened danger, and his body stiffened before being enveloped in a boundless sword aura. The surrounding space began to squeeze down on him, and Lil’ Red gradually got further away, even though he was chasing after them. Xiao Jingyan was getting closer to Lin Yun, who used Light of the Beginning.

Xiao Jingyan could no longer be bothered with Bai Qingyu and released all the saint aura within his body.

When Lin Yun’s sword fell to his neck, Xiao Jingyan’s neck suddenly thickened, and Lin Yun’s sword failed to decapitate him. As Xiao Jingyan retreated to the side, blood flowed down his neck. Xiao Jingyan was inwardly shocked and knew he was careless, even if he was prepared. “How terrifying. That’s the Light of the Beginning?”

He was previously still laughing at Ye Qinghong, and yet he made the same mistake. Xiao Jingyan now knew how Ye Qinghong died.

Lin Yun was also shocked as he looked at Xiao Jingyan. This was the first time the Light of the Beginning failed to take his opponent’s life. Then again, he had just created this move, and it still wasn’t complete yet. There was still a lot of room for improvement. But it would be troublesome to find an opportunity to kill Xiao Jingyan now that he had failed. He now knew why Xiao Jingyan could make it into the top hundredths of the King Ranking with his cultivation only at the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

“As expected of a genius swordsman. Your cultivation is clearly weak, but you’re dangerous with your sword in your hand. Then again, you lost your opportunity,” Xiao Jingyan said coldly.

“Talk after you catch up to me.” Lin Yun didn’t waste words with Xiao Jingyan and fled.

When Xiao Jingyan turned around, Bai Qingyu was nowhere to be seen.

“Damn it!” He quickly circulated his movement technique. A lotus would bloom beneath his feet whenever he stepped forth. The lotuses were all made of Netherworld Ghost Fire. He had actually managed to keep up with Lin Yun.

Lin Yun took a deep breath before executing the Golden Crow Wings at full force, increasing his speed.

“You can’t escape!” Xiao Jingyan snorted as he turned into a bolt of lightning with black flames blazing on the lightning.

Lin Yun suddenly turned around and reached out. Since Xiao Jingyan didn’t bring out his constellation, Xiao Jingyan had yet to treat him seriously, and Lin Yun wanted to use this opportunity to kill him.

“Black Tortoise Chains!” Nine shackles flew from Lin Yun’s palm, manifesting into lightning pythons that shot towards Xiao Jingyan.

Xiao Jingyan tried his best to dodge, knocking two shackles away. But he was bit by three pythons on his chest, right shoulder, and wrist. When Xiao Jingyan fell to the ground, he threw a mouthful of blood. His injuries were clearly heavy, but they didn’t look like a heavy casualty.

This instantly made Lin Yun realize that something wasn’t right, and he frowned, “Your physique isn’t any weaker than some natal saint physiques.”

“You have a lot of trump cards. I don’t believe that trash can become so powerful by relying on one saint origin!” Xiao Jingyan said.

“I’m curious. I’m not surprised that the Ye Clan, Zhang Clan, and Bai Clan want to kill me. But for an outsider like you to be involved, you must be under Wang Muyan’s orders, right?” Lin Yun asked.

Xiao Jingyan’s face changed, and he guessed that Ye Qingtian was buying time to recover his nirvana aura. Ye Qingtian must have exhausted much of his nirvana aura after unleashing so many attacks. But he didn’t expose Ye Qingtian and smiled, “Perhaps we can exchange our secrets. Tell me why you’re here in the Myriad Graves Valley, and I’ll tell you my relationship with Wang Muyan.”

His words proved that Wang Muyan had interfered in this matter. Lin Yun replied, “I’m naturally here for the Udumbara Flower.”

“Bullshit,” Xiao Jingyan said in disdain. “Do you think I’m easy to bluff like Bai Qingyu? Who doesn’t know that the Myriad Graves Valley has a huge secret hidden here? But no one has managed to find it throughout the years. You must know something about it.”

Lin Yun was inwardly shocked when he heard that, and he immediately thought of what Lil’ Purple said about a divine array hidden beneath the Myriad Graves Valley. He said, “I don’t know. I’m here for the Udumbara Flower.”

“Who doesn’t know that the Udumbara Flower is in the Myriad Graves Valley? But no one has managed to find it. Who are you bluffing? Unless…” Xiao Jingyan suddenly smiled and squinted his pupils, “I’m actually not concerned about that. I heard you’re also looking for the Solar Lunar Divine Rune?”

Lin Yun raised his brow and instantly felt that Xiao Jingyan wasn’t simple.

“Don’t be so surprised,” Xiao Jingyan smiled. “If you can help me find the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, Wang Muyan is nothing. I can even help you.”

Lin Yun’s face sank, and he asked, “Xiao Jingyan, who are you?”

“Who are you, too?” Xiao Jingyan smiled. “Let me guess, is your surname Lin?”

Lin Yun was calm and composed when he heard that, which disappointed Xiao Jingyan. Xiao Jingyan smiled, “You can really put up an act, but it doesn’t matter. Let me tell you who I am!”

Xiao Jingyan’s bones began to wriggle and crackle as a demonic radiance shone from his body, and a horrifying pressure began to spread. While Lin Yun felt uncertain, Xiao Jingyan’s forehead broke apart, and a vertical eye appeared.

“The Demonspirit Clan!” Lin Yun exclaimed.

“It has been a long time since I used my real appearance. It’s actually getting stuffy.” Xiao Jingyan greedily gasped for his breath.

But Lin Yun was greatly shocked by Xiao Jingyan’s appearance. He had multiple encounters with the Demonspirit Clan within the Kunlun Realm and Profound Amber Realm. But most of the Demonspirit he ran into were dead, demonic corpses, or on the brink of death. But no one expected that the Demonspirit Clan had joined a holy land. This was too unbelievable.

“Surprised? The Kunlun Realm also belongs to us. I know you’re buying time, and I’m doing the same. You can die now!” Xiao Jingyan smiled. After revealing his true identity, a horrifying power spread out with his cultivation teaching the pinnacle ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

The Stalewater Sword in his hand emitted a powerful sword ray that flew out with a massive water geyser reaching a thousand feet.
