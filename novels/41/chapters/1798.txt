Chapter 1799 - Bashful Moon

There was no response from the carriage. When Lin Yun raised his head, he couldn’t help being baffled and wondered if he had guessed wrongly about this being a person from the Divine Phoenix Mountain.

“Young Master Lin must be joking. I’m not a senior.” A crisp female voice came from the carriage, passing through the curtains. Just from the voice alone, anyone could guess that this person must be a beauty. Her voice was gentle and refreshing, but there was also a hint of nobility and arrogance.

Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei exchanged a gaze before hesitantly they asked, “You are…?”

“Young Master Lin doesn’t have to care who I am. You can state your terms, and I can agree to them on behalf of Divine Phoenix Mountain.” The radiance released by the carriage changed along with the woman’s voice.

“I believe you.” Lin Yun immediately said, looking at the carriage and no longer asking any questions.

“As expected of Young Master Lin.” The voice from the carriage contained a hint of appreciation, and she continued, “I apologize for bothering you today, but I don’t have a choice. So I'd like to apologize to Young Master Lin and Lady Yue.”

“You want Big Brother Lin to play you the Phoenix Heart Song?” Yue Weiwei asked, blinking her eyes.

The carriage fell into a brief silence before the woman said, “Lady Yue is brilliant, and I’m ashamed to say that no one can perfectly play the perfect artistic concept at Divine Phoenix Mountain. Not even seniors who have grasped the Saint King Tune could be compared to Young Master Lin’s performance at the Nirvana Banquet. This is why I had no choice but to come and disturb you two myself.”

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by this because this was part of his plan. He was personally taught by Lil’ Purple, and it was useless if you have the score but not Lil’ Purple’s guidance.

“I understand.” Lin Yun turned to look at Yue Weiwei, who gave him a smile. She understood his intentions and handed the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute over.

This made Lin Yun smile. This was the rapport between them, and they didn’t even have to speak.

“I apologize if I performed badly.” Lin Yun wasn’t being humble, but it was mainly because the person stayed in the carriage, and he was telling her indirectly he was about to start playing.

“Please, go ahead.” The woman in the carriage said.

A moment later, Lin Yun started to play the Phoenix Heart Song with the Divine Indigo Bamboo Flute. He had played it with the Divine Indigo Bamboo Flute for a fairly long time. After parting with Lil’ Purple, he played it almost every day, and he was already familiar with it. He was calm and composed without any distractions, and his melody was like a stream flowing in the mountain.

This is it? It doesn’t seem any different. Rather, it even sounds a little worse in comparison. The woman in the carriage furrowed her brows with doubt in her pupils.

Lin Yun’s version of the Phoenix Heart Song didn’t have the nobility or majesty of the phoenix. If the version played by the seniors on the Divine Mountain Phoenix sounded like a noble phoenix, Lin Yun’s version was ordinary with nothing special about it. Apart from being clean, there was nothing remarkable about his version.

Just when her doubts were growing, she was shocked to discover that the nirvana aura contained within the phoenix flame within her body was ignited. The nirvana aura then soon spread throughout her body like Phoenix Sacred Flames.

The Phoenix Saint Canon uncontrollably started circulating within her body. There was a crimson mark shining on her forehead, and she also began to emit a golden glow. This naturally shocked her with astonishment filling her eyes, “How is this possible?!”

But she didn’t have time to ask it now and suppressed the doubt within her heart before immersing herself in the Phoenix Heart Song. She came because she ran into a bottleneck in the Phoenix Saint Canon. If she could make it through this ordeal, she would be able to grasp the Phoenix Sacred Flame, becoming the youngest one to grasp it in the history of Divine Phoenix Mountain.

As Lin Yun’s melody penetrated through the curtain and entered the carriage, it filled every single corner of this carriage. Each note could make one person’s heart at peace, and she was unconsciously immersed in it. Under the nourishment of the melody, the nirvana aura within her body became active and excited.

The shackles that normally bound her were slowly disintegrating, and this became a miraculous feeling. This was the reaction mentioned by those who returned to Divine Phoenix Mountain from the Nirvana Banquet. But when they played this song according to the score, none of them could achieve a similar effect.

Thus, many people felt that they were lying, but this woman believed it now. What they said wasn’t false, and it was even more unbelievable than they described. The Nirvana Banquet’s champion was truly impressive.

Under the nourishment of the Phoenix Heart Song, the nirvana aura coursing through her body began to transform as wisps of golden flames were swiftly being extracted from within the violet palace.

The flames were powerful, emitting a sacred aura. As a result, the golden radiance that she emitted became even more dazzling, causing the carriage to look like a dazzling sun on the sea. As for the beasts pulling the carriage, they closed their eyes and rested peacefully on the surface of the sea.

One song later, Lin Yun lowered the Divine Indigo Bamboo Flute, but the radiance shining from the carriage was still going strong. A long time later, the radiance suddenly disappeared along with a phoenix cry.

The sea had finally calmed down, and the beasts slowly stood up, looking at Lin Yun curiously. Looking at those beasts, Yue Weiwei blinked her eyes and commented, “Hehe, these lions are pretty adorable.”

These saint beasts possessed Bai Ze’s bloodline. They had the body of a lion with horns on Their heads and a goatee beard. But the beard didn’t make them seem old. On the contrary, it made them look adorable, instead.

Bai Ze was an ancient divine beast, and these saint beasts possessed its bloodline. This meant that these saint beasts might be able to grow into divine beasts in the future. This indirectly meant that the person in the carriage must have a high status at Divine Phoenix Mountain.

“You have my promise on behalf of Divine Phoenix Mountain.” A voice came from the carriage.

“Thank you.” Lin Yun’s pupils shone with a gleam of light. He briefly pondered before he continued, “If you guys need any other scores of the phoenix inheritance, you can come and look for me any time.”

He was trying to catch a big fish. He knew that it was impossible for Divine Phoenix Mountain to stand on the Sword Sect’s side with just the Phoenix Heart Song alone. But what if there was an endless supply of phoenix inheritance? If they could benefit from it, they would slowly be hooked by him.

There are more? The mysterious woman was shocked upon hearing what Lin Yun said, and she replied, “Okay. Young Master Lin can pay the Divine Phoenix Mountain a visit anytime.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun acknowledged.

“Big Brother Lin, give me a kiss.” Right then, Yue Weiwei whispered. This made Lin Yun slightly taken aback, but he still lowered his face and gave her a kiss. He didn’t know whether it was a coincidence, but the curtain was opened and revealed a delicate face.

The woman in the carriage wanted to see what Lin Yun looked like, but she could only see Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei kissing each other. This made her briefly stunned before a wisp of anger flashed through her pupils. After all, it was too much for them to be so affectionate in front of her.

But she soon calmed down and took a deep breath before lowering the curtain. As the carriage soared to the sky, it streaked across the horizon and swiftly disappeared.

A long time later, after Lin Yun’s lips parted with Yue Weiwei, he asked with a smile, “You did this on purpose?”

He had seen the woman with his Sword Heart, and he could tell she was unhappy. It was as though Yue Weiwei had predicted the woman would take a glance at him.

“What are you talking about?” Yue Weiwei put on a harmless face and innocently blinked her eyes.

“You know her?” Lin Yun smiled, looking at the direction the carriage left in.

“I don’t, but I have heard of her. She should be the Divine Phoenix Maiden from the Divine Phoenix Mountain, the princess of the Ji Clan. She’s the most beautiful woman in the Eastern Desolation, and one of the three women every man in the Kunlun Realm wants to marry.” Yue Weiwei smiled.

“Who are the other two?” Lin Yun asked with a smile.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“One is the pearl of the Mo Clan. It is said everyone who saw her couldn’t resist her charm. In addition to the Mo Clan’s mysterious background, she is the most mysterious lady in the Kunlun Realm.” Yue Weiwei then briefly paused before she smiled, “As for the last one, I won’t talk about her.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned and soon knew who she was talking about. He smiled, “So you’re doing it on purpose.”

“Of course, I’m doing this on purpose. Who does she think she is to be so aloof and not even leaving her carriage before Big Brother Lin. It even sounded more like she was giving an order rather than a request. Isn’t it just a broken carriage? When Big Brother Lin comes to my home in the future, I’ll take my father’s Imperial Dragon Carriage out!” Yue Weiwei snorted. “She clearly received benefits, but she still has no intention of leaving the carriage. I knew she wouldn’t be able to restrain her curiosity to look at you, so I let her look.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered before he smiled, “It does make some sense.”

He didn’t feel that Yue Weiwei did anything wrong. On the contrary, this made Yue Weiwei look even more adorable, instead.

“Big Brother Lin, who’s more beautiful between us?” Yue Weiwei smiled.

“You’re the moon in the sky, and she’s the phoenix on a mountain. So even if she’s beautiful, she’s still beneath the moon.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hehe, is that true?” Yue Weiwei’s face was filled with joy when she heard that.

“Of course, it is.” Lin Yun said seriously.

Blinking her eyes, Yue Weiwei smiled, “Then who’s more beautiful? The moon or me?”

“That’s hard to say.” Lin Yun smiled wryly.

“Tell me, tell me!” As they walked on the sea, Yue Weiwei kept shaking Lin Yun’s hand under the moonlight.

“Do you remember our first meeting at the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion?” Lin Yun asked.

“Of course, I do. Senior Sister requested that you play the Ni Chang Dress Song for me.”

“That’s right. I felt that this is a heavenly song, and it needed a heavenly dance to match it. But I was really shocked to see you.” Lin Yun said, and he continued, “I was happy at that time, but I didn’t dare to reunite with you. I never expected that we'd meet again in this manner since our parting on the Heavenly Path.

“I don’t know which is more beautiful, you or the moon. But for you, I’m willing to praise the moon in the sky for her beauty and the snow on the ground. Because the moon makes your eyes seem gentle, and the snow has your shadow reflected on it. I remember there was a moon on that night, and you looked back at me under the moonlight. My mind went blank at that moment, and I could sense everything overwhelming me.” Lin Yun said, and he couldn’t help smiling as he reminisced.

When he lowered his head to look at Yue Weiwei, her face was red under the moonlight, and her beauty added a hint of bashfulness to the moon.
