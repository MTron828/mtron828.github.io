Chapter 608 - Great Boost in Cultivation

Looking at the expression on the faces of the elders, Mu Chen asked, “You guys have no idea what happened in the Withernorth Sea?”

Facing Mu Chen’s questions, they shook their heads. This made Mu Chen hesitate. After a brief moment later, Mu Chen explained, “Lin Yun refined the Profound Yin Water in the Withernorth Sea and reached the lesser Yang stage. Furthermore, he even grasped the xiantian sword intent at greater mastery!”

The former was still acceptable. After all, Lin Yun had a powerful cultivation before entering the Withernorth Sea. Sooner or later, he would reach the Yang stage, not to mention that Lin Yun even found the Profound Yin Water. But the second news was a little terrifying. After all, there weren’t many people among the younger generations who grasped their xiantian sword intent in greater mastery.

But Tang Yu expressed his doubt, “Even if he grasped the xiantian sword intent in greater mastery, his foundation should still be weaker. So it makes no sense that he can reach the eighth trial.”

His gaze was sharp as he stared at Mu Chen.

Mu Chen smiled bitterly, “Senior Tang, Leng Haoyu was killed by Lin Yun. Leng Haoyu and Lin Zhiyuan joined hands to gang up on Senior Sister Mo Ling. In the end, when Lin Yun arrived, he killed Leng Haoyu and made Lin Zhiyuan flee for his life.

“Are you serious?” Tang Yu was alarmed by the revelation and his face turned grave.

Mu Chen smiled, “I don’t have the guts to lie to you. Furthermore, what happened next was even more terrifying. Lin Yun took a palm from Ji Wuye and came out unscathed.”

As he continued to explain what happened, shock grew on their faces. After a long time later, Tang Yu spoke out with his eyebrows frowned, “It’s something worth celebrating that Lin Yun is so strong, but the Bloodwing Pavilion won’t let this matter go so easily. As for Ji Wuye, he’s a grudgeful fellow, so I’m afraid there will be trouble when he comes out.”

Right at this moment, an elder spoke out, “That’s weird, why isn’t Liu Yunyan out? Can it be that she made it through the third trial?”

“I can’t be so sure about that,” said Mu Chen as he fell into deep thoughts, “The third trial mainly consists of a certain formation used by the puppets. If her attainment in spiritual runes is high enough, there’s a possibility that she might make it through the third trial. But the fourth trial won’t be so easy anymore…” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Meanwhile, in a secluded room located on the fifth level, a figure was facing five silver armored puppets with his boundless sword aura. The five puppets were working perfectly together and dragon roars could be vaguely heard.

But even so, the five puppets were defeated by a blue-clothed youth and his sword. The youth that shattered the five puppets with a sword was Xie Yunqiao. Only he could possibly possess such a powerful sword aura.

At the same time, Guo Xu had also completed the fifth trial. But compared to Xie Yunqiao, he was in a much more terrible state. Although he only suffered light injuries, he still suffered several wounds from the puppets’ spears.

“I’m actually injured...I’ll have to search the fifth level carefully or I’ll be suffering a loss.” Guo Xu licked his lips as he entered the fifth level. The trials were tougher than the previous ones, but to experts like Ji Wuye, Yan Kong, Qin An, and Pei Yue, the trials were still pretty easy.

While the others were still struggling on the fourth trial, they had already passed through the fifth trial. As for Lin Yun, he had already passed the fifth trial and was currently preparing to make a breakthrough.

In a secret chamber on the fifth level, the Infernal Flower blossomed and a blazing energy spread out. This was the true essence of the Infernal Flower, which contained boundless energy. Right now, the entire chamber was permeated by the torrential spiritual energy from the Infernal Flower.

Meanwhile, the Iris Flower in Lin Yun’s violet palace was becoming uneasy. After reaching the Yang stage, the temptation coming from the Infernal Flower wasn’t something that Lin Yun could hold back. He had gotten this flower two months ago, but Mo Ling told him not to refine it before reaching the Yang stage.

Lin Yun had followed Mo Ling’s advice all along, so he only refined a small piece of the petal before entering the Withernorth Sea. Although it was only a petal, the benefit Lin Yun got from it allowed him to stabilize his cultivation in the pinnacle Yin stage.

And now, he could finally refine the Infernal Flower. Additionally, Lin Yun found a precious Firecloud Pellet on the fifth level. The moment Lin Yun obtained the pellet, he stopped searching the fifth level and made preparations for his breakthrough.

Taking out a Firecloud Pellet, Lin Yun swallowed it and circulated the Iris Sword Sutra to refine it. When the Iris Flower and pellet’s energy combined together, they released a powerful energy within Lin Yun’s body that instantly filled every corner of his body. If Lin Yun’s body hadn’t been refined by the Profound Yin Water, there was no way he could endure this pressure.

But even so, Lin Yun still felt terrible right and his forehead was covered in sweat. His face was pale and void of all color. But when the pressure disappeared, Lin Yun could feel his origin energy surging within the violet palace as a sword buzz rang out within his body.

At this moment, his cultivation was progressing at a rapid speed and he was undergoing a transformation. Under the flames of the Infernal Flower, a wisp of golden radiance was added to the silver violet palace.

Lin Yun rejoiced because he knew that there was a high possibility that he could make a breakthrough with this speed. As time gradually passed, the silver radiance emitted from Lin Yun grew even more powerful.

He sat with his legs crossed while his origin energy surged violently like a wave. His clothes were fluttering and his facial features were becoming even more defined. When he was done refining the Infernal Flower, his aura had grown to a terrifying level. Meanwhile, his silver origin energy continued to mix with golden strands.

When the Iris Flower bloomed within his body, there were a total of eighty-four petals. Upon opening his eyes, Lin Yun’s pupils shined brightly and his gaze pierced through the air. Under the empowerment of eighty-four petals, Lin Yun’s sword aura had reached a terrifying stage.

But it was a pity that he was still a step away from the greater Yang stage. Then again, Lin Yun wasn’t too anxious about it because he knew that cultivating would get harder after reaching the Violet Palace Realm. He might not have been able to make a breakthrough, but at least he was only one step away. As long as he had the right opportunity, he could take that step easily, which would stabilize his cultivation even more. In the end, his strength had undergone a drastic transformation under the Infernal Flower and Firecloud Pellet.

Lin Yun, who was seated on the ground, suddenly threw a punch to test his strength. Unleashing his sword aura accompanied by saintly music, his aura made the entire chamber tremble.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he threw a punch at the wall in front of him. He had gathered the eighty-four sword rays in his violet palace into his fist.

From his punch, the chamber suddenly crumbled, signifying that his explosive power had gotten a lot more terrifying.

“I should be able to deal with ordinary greater Yang stage cultivators without using martial techniques now. If I have the Flower Burial Sword with me, even those in the pinnacle Yang stage might not be able to take three moves from me,” muttered Lin Yun. If Leng Haoyu were still alive, he was confident in killing him with only three swords.

Although there was still a huge gap between Ji Wuye and him, he no longer had to bring out all of his trump cards to fight.

“I still haven’t finished searching the fifth level. Let’s see if there’s anything else I can harvest,” said Lin Yun as he disappeared from the chamber.
