Chapter 402 - No Choice

The plump old man’s voice was cold when he said those words, especially the last part. This made Guardian Plum wear a complicated expression as he didn’t know what to say.

Looking at Guardian Plum’s expression, Jian Xuanhe sighed, “This is ultimately her affair, so we can’t make the decision for her.”

“But we don’t have many choices at times and the decision she made might not be what she wanted,” said Guardian Plum as he balled his fists together.

“So what?” Jian Xuanhe looked at Guardian Plum and said, “The hardest thing in the world is to follow your heart. Even I can’t do that, not to mention her. But I’ve already said that no one can touch her if she’s not willing.”

“Pavilion Master…” said Guardian Plum.

“Leave. There’s no need to ask me about it since you’ve already made your decision. I made a move ten years ago and I have a pact with that person not to interfere in this matter anymore. But you didn’t, so you can do whatever you want.” Jian Xuanhe waved his hand to get Guardian Plum to leave.

“I understand. I’ll take my leave then,” replied Guardian Plum after a long silence.

It was just as what the Pavilion Master had said. There was nothing the Sword Firmament Pavilion could do even if they wanted to help because they didn’t have an excuse to make their move. This meant that the reasons and righteousness would be on the other party’s side.

At the Locket Mountain, two people stood together. The one on the left had an unfathomable aura, while the one on the right wore the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s uniform as he emitted a faint glow.

The former was naturally the Great Qin Empire’s prince, Qin Yu of the eight titles. As for the latter, he was naturally Bai Lixuan, who was equally as well known as Qin Yu. He had the strongest aptitude in the Great Qin Empire and there weren’t many who could compete with him even in the Ancient Southern Domain.

Now that his cultivation reached the pinnacle ninth stage of the Profound Martial Realm, his achievement in his sword intent wasn’t any inferior either.

“Your Highness, you have already visited twice since Xin Yan woke up and this is your third time,” said Bai Lixuan as he looked at Qin Yu weirdly. He knew that Qin Yu was prideful, which meant that this matter was important since Qin Yu repeatedly tried to pay a visit.

There were rumors that the crown prince had caught a liking to Xin Yan’s appearance, but Bai Lixuan didn’t think that it was that simple. Although, Xin Yan was naturally the most beautiful female in the Sword Firmament Pavilion and many people had a crush on her.

But it was a pity that none of them caught her attention and anyone who tried their luck with her would be killed by her sword. So it made sense that the crown prince wanted to conquer a woman like her, but Bai Lixuan didn’t believe it. He knew that Qin Yu wasn’t someone who would lose himself over a woman, especially since he could get any woman he wanted with his position.

“That’s to be expected. I would feel uneasy if everything went smoothly. Furthermore, you can just call me by my name. You don’t have to be concerned with my identity in the empire. You will walk out of the empire sooner or later to a wider world.” Qin Yu paused briefly before he turned to look at Bai Lixuan, “The Dragon Gate Competition will take place two months from now. Do you think you’ll be able to get one of the titles?”

Upon mentioning the Dragon Gate Competition, Bai Lixuan’s face turned grave. He replied, “I still lack some foundation compared to the eight titles. At most, I only have 40% confidence in winning, but I still have one month left.”

“You’re rather humble,” smiled Qin Yu. “You possess the Saint Physique, so time will always be on your side. It’s hard to say what will happen a month from now, but let me tell you a piece of good news. Drifting Goblet won’t be participating in the Dragon Gate Competition at the end of this year.”

“Are you serious?” Bai Lixuan’s face changed. It was great news and it would have already spread throughout the Great Qin Empire if it was true.

“Absolutely,” replied Qin Yu.

“Has he exceeded the age of twenty-five?” asked Bai Lixuan.

“How can that be? He’s one year younger than me. But I can’t guess what he is thinking. Well, it doesn’t matter because I can be sure that he won’t participate in this Dragon Gate Competition.”

Drifting Goblet was the champion of the previous Dragon Gate Competition and he was someone who even defeated Qin Yu. Qin Yu was fearful of Drifting Goblet, but he also wanted to cleanse his loss in this Dragon Gate Competition. But it turns out that Drifting Goblet wasn’t even giving him the chance to do so.

Although Qin Yu felt relieved that Drifting Goblet wasn’t participating, it also made him feel disappointed. But this was undoubtedly a piece of good news to Bai Lixuan. If one of the titled figures didn’t participate in the competition, this meant that there was another slot opening.

Even if Bai Lixuan had another months’ time, his odds of defeating a titled figure was only 50%. But it had now changed to 80% since Drifting Goblet wasn’t participating.

Bai Lixuan fell into deep thoughts and said, “So I do have a chance to participate in the Draconic Banquet with you.”

“Let’s go to Locket Mountain now.” The two naturally attracted the attention of many disciples nearby. THe disciples were baffled when they saw the two of them together.

Among the group, there were two who wore an unsightly expression. It was Lin Qiushan and Lin Yan, the two sisters.

“Big Sister, if the news that father got from the Wang Clan is right, this means that the crown prince is trying to force Senior Sister Xin Yan into a dead-end.” Lin Yan stared at Qin Yu and Bai Lixuan with rage burning in her eyes.

“Well what can we do about it? He’s the crown prince. Who dares to go against him in the Great Qin Empire?” Lin Qiushan smiled bitterly.

“I must let Big Brother Lin know about this.” Lin Yan knew that Lin Yun would regret it for his entire life if this happened without him knowing. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“You lass. Do you know that barging into the Repent Cliff is a death offence? Furthermore, you won’t be able to go up even if you tried,” said Lin Qiushan.

“So be it. I still want to give it a try no matter what.” Lin Yan’s eyes flashed with determination, but she was stopped by Lin Qiushan just when she was about to move. After all, barging into the Repent Cliff was punishable by death and the deacons who stood guard there wouldn’t care about her identity. So Lin Qiushan did not want to take this risk.

Qin Yu and Bai Lixuan stood together in the Locket Mountain and the Locket Mountain’s disciples all wore an ugly expression when they saw them. It was especially so when they saw the crown prince. But they didn’t dare to do anything out of concern for the crown prince’s identity.

“Bai Lixuan, stand guard for me here. Don’t let anyone in.”

“Sure, don’t worry about it,” replied Bai Lixuan.

When Qin Yu entered, he saw someone swinging a sword around in the courtyard. Her swords were like blood roses that danced in the wind.

“What a brilliant sword technique,” smiled Qin Yu as he clapped his hands.

“Get lost.” Xin Yan sheathed her sword and didn’t turn around.

“Xin Yan, is there a need for you to be so cold-blooded? No matter what, we still have a friendship from when we were kids. It’s not an exaggeration to say that we grew up together,” smiled Qin Yu.

“Grew up together? Get lost as far as you can. Don’t force me to attack!” Xin Yan spoke with a trembling voice. She was suppressing her rage and killing intent to that point that her hand was trembling.

“You won’t.” Qin Yu appeared before Xin Yan with a confident smile on his lips. “I never repeat anything for a third time, but you’re an exception. Speaking of which, we do have an engagement between us. If it wasn’t for what happened back then…”

Qin Yu spoke with a smile as he examined Xin Yan’s figure.

“Shut it!” Xin Yan emitted her killing intent, but she didn’t draw her sword. It wasn’t because she didn’t dare, but she couldn’t.

Sensing Xin Yan’s killing intent, the smile slowly disappeared on Qin Yu’s face and he said coldly, “I thought you were a smart person, but I never imagined that you would be so stubborn. I’ve given you enough face to ask you three times. When you come to beg me in the future, I won’t be so nice to you anymore.”

As he examined Xin Yan’s face, he sneered, “You want to commit suicide? Not so easy. Do you think that everyone will be settled when you’re dead? You have to think for your clansmen who were exiled to the borders as well as Lin Yun who crippled his profound vein and is now on the Repent Cliff.”

“Try it if you dare! I dare you to touch a single hair on junior brother!” Xin Yan drew her sword and pointed it at Qin Yu.

“Haha, why don’t you bet if I dare since you’re unwilling? I’m giving you three days to consider…” Qin Yu smiled and when he walked past Xin Yan, he continued, “Xin Yan, do you still think that you have a choice? Do you have any other choice aside from agreeing to me?”

Xin Yan’s body was trembling as she felt a stinging pain in her heart. Her big brother had died and her big brother was her last hope. She was indeed, out of options. Even if she pretended to be strong, it still couldn’t conceal the fact that she was helpless.

“Ye Xinyan, think it through this well. This is your final chance, but you only have three days. Otherwise, don’t blame me for the consequences,” said Qin Yu coldly.
