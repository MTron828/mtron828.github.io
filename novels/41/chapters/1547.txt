Chapter 1548 - I Only Keep Cats, Not Dogs

The Azureflame Saint Lord and Indigothunder Saint Lord hurriedly entered the Hundred Flowers Valley upon receiving permission. When they swept their gazes over after entering, they immediately found Tian Xuanzi enjoying the flowers.

Tian Xuanzi was unfathomable in their eyes. He was right before them, but he gave them the feeling he was in a painting and out of their reach. It felt as though there was a barrier isolating them.

“Seniors, it has been some time.” Tian Xuanzi smiled, and his smile made all the flowers lose their luster in comparison.

“Seniors? We can’t accept that. Don’t tell me that you don’t know Qin Xiao is dead!” The Indigothunder Saint Lord mocked.

“I just received the news, and I’m greatly saddened by it. Mu Xuankong is too overbearing.” Tian Xuanzi was still smiling and showed no signs of sadness.

This only made the Indigothunder Saint Lord even more furious as he roared, “Tian Xuanzi, you ingrate! Back then, when you hadn’t become a saint, our Nether Divinity Clan supported you with resources!”

“I have long repaid the Nether Divinity Clan tenfold.” Tian Xuanzi replied. “The three tasks I promised the Nether Divinity Clan have been fulfilled. Then again, Qin Xiao’s death was too sudden, and I didn’t expect that.”

“Tian Xuanzi, stop acting. You allowed Jin Jue to leave on purpose! If you’re willing to make a move, how would things develop in this manner? You can kill an Elysium Core Realm genius with a wave of your hand, so there’s no need for Jin Jue to take the risk.” The Indigothunder Saint Lord said.

“You’re right.” Tian Xuanzi gently replied and didn’t seem furious at all by Indigothunder Saint Lord’s words.

This nearly made the Indigothunder Saint Lord throw out a mouthful of blood. Right then, Azureflame Saint Lord, who was quietly standing beside him, asked, “Since you did’t know about it beforehand, you won’t avoid it now, right?”

“That’s for sure.” Tian Xuanzi replied.

“Since that’s the case, I’d like to ask the saint sovereign to ask the Radiant Sword Saint for an explanation on our behalf!” The Azureflame Saint Lord said. He was more composed than the Indigothunder Saint Lord, slowly pulling Tian Xuanzi into his trap with his words.

But Tian Xuanzi merely raised his head to look at him as though he was looking at an idiot. This instantly made the Azureflame Saint Lord furious, and he now knew why the Indigothunder Saint Lord’s temper was so uncontrollable when he talked to Tian Xuanzi.

“The Radiant Sword Saint doesn’t have a good temper, not to mention that you guys are the ones who started it. Are you guys sure you want to go? You guys aren’t afraid to be slain by the Radiant Sword Saint?” Tian Xuanzi briefly paused before he continued, “It looks like you guys don’t know anything. Lin Yun isn’t an ordinary Elysium Core Realm genius, he’s a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint. The Radiant Sword Saint visited the Netherworld Hall not too long ago, slaying three saints in his trip!”

The Azureflame Saint Lord and Indigothunder Saint Lord exchanged a gaze, and they could see the shock in each other’s pupils. After all, they didn’t know about that because they had been in seclusion. But Qin Xiao was confident that the Radiant Sword Saint was old and he couldn’t descend with another clone. Aside from the Radiant Sword Saint, Qin Xiao didn’t think the Nether Divinity Clan would fear anyone.

Most importantly, Qin Xiao felt that the Sword Sect had declined, and they didn’t have the guts to face the Nether Divinity Clan head-on. In the end, Qin Xiao was just courting death, and he wouldn’t have died if he hadn’t taken the initiative to send Jin Jue to the Sword Sect.

“Do the two of you still want to go now?” Tian Xuanzi looked at the two saint lords with mockery in his pupils.

The two saint lords exchanged a gaze and felt they had no dignity before Tian Xuanzi. The Azureflame Saint Lord asked, “What do you plan to do, then?”

“We have a lot of time ahead of us.” Tian Xuanzi replied, and his reply made the two saint lords furious. They already knew that Tian Xuanzi wouldn’t give them any face, but they didn’t expect that Tian Xuanzi couldn’t even be bothered to say something polite.

They really felt that the Nether Divinity Clan was blind to nurturing Tian Xuanzi back then. The Nether Divinity Clan lost a patriarch, and Tian Xuanzi was smiling.

“Tian Xuanzi, don’t think you can get yourself out of this. You sent Mu Xuankong a letter, right?” The Indigothunder Saint Lord questioned.

When he heard that, a cold light flashed within Tian Xuanzi’s pupils, and he smiled, “Looks like the Nether Divinity Clan has a lot of undercovers in the Profound Sky Sect.”

“You don’t have to care about that. I want to know what you wrote to the Sword Sect!” The Indigothunder Saint Lord coldly questioned.

“That’s between us, it has nothing to do with you.” Tian Xuanzi replied, and the atmosphere between both parties suddenly tensed up.

“Hmph, talk to the ancestor if you have anything to say!” The Indigothunder Saint Lord snorted.

The Nether Divinity Ancestor was the strongest saint of the Nether Divinity Clan, who contributed significantly to the Divine Dragon Empire, thus receiving a title from the Divine Dragon Empire. Others think he was dead because the Nether Divinity Ancestor was active since the Darkest Era and had been around for over three thousand years.

But few people know that the Nether Divinity Ancestor was still alive within the Nether Divinity War Realm.

Tian Xuanzi’s face finally changed, and he replied, “I’m not going anywhere.”

“You don’t have a choice!” The Indigothunder Saint Lord snorted before he disappeared.

“Watch out!” The Azureflame Saint Lord’s face changed, but it was already too late. The Indigothunder Saint Lord appeared before Tian Xuanzi and had reached out for Tian Xuanzi’s right shoulder. The two were only an inch away, but the Indigothunder Saint Lord felt like a mirror had isolated them.

Tian Xuanzi ultimately made a move, reaching out with his right hand and grabbed onto the Indigothunder Saint Lord’s throat. Everything happened in the blink of an eye, and the Indigothunder Saint Lord didn’t even have the time to react.

While holding the Indigothunder Saint Lord by the throat, Tian Xuanzi smiled, “You want me to go to the Nether Divinity Ancestor? Why? Do you want me to seek forgiveness or have the Nether Divinity Ancestor punish me? Do you think the Nether Divinity Ancestor can easily hold my life in his hand like in the past? Do you believe that I won’t kill you here?”

The Indigothunder Saint Lord was suffocating with his face turned red. Tian Xuanzi was even more terrifying than a ghost in his eyes, which covered his back in a cold sweat. He didn’t doubt that Tian Xuanzi would dare to take his life.

“Tian Xuanzi!” The Azureflame Saint Lord exclaimed. But a cat hopped onto his head just when he wanted to help. This immediately made the Azureflame Saint Lord feel a chill run down his spine. It was just a cat, but it made him feel like he was sinking into the abyss.

As the cat yawned, the Azureflame Saint Lord’s legs began to tremble. “Misunderstanding! This is just a misunderstanding! Tian Xuanzi, let him go. I believe he didn’t mean it.”

But Tian Xuanzi didn’t respond, and he only looked at the Indigothunder Saint Lord with a smile.

“Saint Sovereign, We’re at fault. This was just a misunderstanding!” The Azureflame Saint Lord continued.

In the end, Tian Xuanzi threw the Indigothunder Saint Lord away as the snow leopard cat hopped into his embrace.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“L-Let’s go!” The Azureflame Saint Lord could feel his scalp tingling as he quickly supported his companion.

“Go on.” Tian Xuanzi looked at the snow leopard cat in his embrace and continued, “Oh, and I only keep cats, not dogs.”

The Indigothunder Saint Lord knew that those words were directed at them. After they had walked far enough away, the Indigothunder Saint Lord ranted, “I’ll kill that sissy, sooner or later!”

When the Indigothunder Saint Lord said those words, the Azureflame Saint Lord knew that they were doomed and his legs began to tremble. Even the Indigothunder Saint Lord could feel a pair of eyes directed at him, and he instantly froze.

As the snow leopard cat hopped out of Tian Xuanzi’s embrace, a terrifying saint aura exploded from Tian Xuanzi. The two saint lords were shocked to discover that they couldn’t budge.

When Tian Xuanzi took a step forth, he had a decapitated head in his embrace upon appearing before the Azureflame Saint Lord. That head naturally belonged to the Indigothunder Saint Lord.

This made the Azureflame Saint Lord’s face pale. He knew that Tian Xuanzi was strong, but he never had a gauge of Tian Xuanzi’s strength. After all, people would often neglect Tian Xuanzi’s strength because of his feminine appearance. They forgot that Tian Xuanzi was someone who could face the Radiant Sword Saint.

“Catch.” Tian Xuanzi tossed the head over.

The Azureflame Saint Lord subconsciously reached out to catch the head. When he came to his senses, he wanted to throw it away, but he didn’t dare to make any move when he saw Tian Xuanzi squinting his eyes.

“I suddenly changed my mind. Come, let’s go to the Nether Divinity War Realm.”

“Saint Sovereign, you must be joking.”

“No, no, no. I’m guilty and have to seek the ancestor's forgiveness.” Tian Xuanzi smiled as he grabbed onto the Azureflame Saint Lord and disappeared from the valley.

As for the snow leopard cat, it came over, dragging the Indigothunder Saint Lord’s headless corpse with its mouth covered in blood. In the next second, the entire valley trembled as all the flowers suddenly became sinister; they shot forth and started tearing the headless corpse into pieces.
