Chapter 2268 - Divine Flame's Emergence

Under the protection of eight saint elders from the Divine Phoenix Mountain, Ji Zixi slowly rose into the air with her hands facing upwards. Her eyes were closed, her eyelashes trembling as a dazzling saint radiance shone from her.

“As expected of the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s little princess. She’s really good-looking,” Li Feibai praised. Even as a woman, she had to admit that Ji Zixi’s looks were flawless. She smiled as she began to tempt Lin Yun, “Are you really not attracted by her beauty?”

“I discovered that your personality has changed after you put on the mask. I prefer the unruly and cold you from the beginning,” Lin Yun said. Back when Li Feibai was in disguise as a man, she was really aloof.

“That’s because you don’t understand me well,” Li Feibai muttered.

Lin Yun ignored her and toyed with the Othershore Flower in his hand while trying to devise a plan. The Othershore Flower was beautiful, looking dreamy and unrealistic. The slender petals looked like flames swaying in the wind.

“This flower is really beautiful. Let me borrow it!” Li Feibai’s eyes lit up, wanting to reach out to the Othershore Flower.

But the Othershore Flower jumped to Lin Yun’s arm and shuttled into his clothes before poking out a little as though it was poking its head out.

Li Feibai smiled, “This flower is intelligent.”

“You’re right about that,” Lin Yun smiled.

“I’m just talking about it casually, and yet you’re treating it as the truth?” Li Feibai said with disdain.

While they were speaking, Ji Zixi had opened her eyes and a golden light shown from them. As a phoenix cry resounded, it sounded ethereal and beautiful. Ji Zixi looked sacred the next second as golden flames appeared in her palm. An ancient aura began spreading out when the flames were ignited, making Ji Zixi look dignified.

“She’s really charming,” Li Feibai said.

When Ji Zixi raised her palm, the sky was dyed golden before a phoenix flew out from a golden cloud, crying as it landed on the stone monument. When the phoenix flame landed on the stone monument, it began to give off a sizzling sound as it began to melt like wax.

“It’s working!” Huang Jingyu’s eyes lit up, while the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord and Liu Yunlan beside him wore grave expressions.

“That’s the Phoenix Fire?”

“Pure phoenix aura. It looks like the purity of Ji Zixi’s phoenix bloodline is high. I heard that she possessed the Phoenix Divine Physique from birth, it’s just that it has been sealed.”

“It looks like this little princess has a huge origin. She even has a chance to become an Emperor in the future!”

“The Eastern Desolation’s remaining representative is the Divine Phoenix Mountain.” When they saw this, many people in the Flame Dragon Valley were captivated by Ji Zixi’s splendour. Compared to Lin Yun’s swordsmanship, the halo coming from Ji Zixi mostly came from her phoenix bloodline. But she was too beautiful, and more people would naturally admire Ji Zixi if they had to choose.

Zhao Tianyu and the Ying River King were witnessing this scene from a high building a few thousand miles away.

The Ying River King was still holding a grudge against Zhao Tianyu for dragging him away. He said, “You shouldn’t have dragged me away. Even though we are here to gather information, didn’t find anything. At the very least, we must probe their Sovereign Saint Artifacts.”

They were the first wave to arrive because they had heard that the five holy lands had brought their Sovereign Saint Artifacts out. They wanted to find out more information about the Sovereign Saint Artifacts. The plan initially went smoothly, but Lin Yun’s appearance ruined everything.

Zhao Tianyu smiled, “But you don’t have to disclose your identity as a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit for that cause. Also, who said that we found nothing?”

“Oh?” The Ying River King curiously looked at Zhao Tianyu. He asked, “What do you mean?”

Zhao Tianyu smiled mysteriously, “First, the five holy lands might seem to have joined forces, but their alliance isn’t firm. The moment the divine flames appear, they will fight amongst themselves, even without us. They probably have Sovereign Saint Artifacts since several holy lands could barely hold themselves back when Gu Xinyu stood out. But they ultimately held it back… This means that the Sovereign Saint Artifacts cannot be used so recklessly. After all, only Saint Lords can enter the Heavenly Void.”

The Ying River King’s face changed, before he said, “I can also figure that out. But we have to get rid of Flower Burial. We can’t let him leave the God Burial Mountain Range.”

“No need to rush,” Zhao Tianyu replied. “He has already risen, and he will bring endless troubles in the future if we can’t kill him. But now isn’t the time, and you might not be able to kill him even if you bring out your bloodline. The Divine Phoenix Mountain will protect him if you fail to kill him. At that time, your identity as a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit will be disclosed.”

“You’re doubting my bloodline?” The Ying River King said unhappily.

“I don’t dare to doubt your bloodline. But have you considered the pressure that your bloodline might give the other holy lands? At that time, it will make them even more united instead,” Zhao Tianyu said.

When the Ying River King heard that, his murderous intent receded a little. Taking a few deep breaths to calm himself down, he sighed, “I was influenced by him.”

He was usually calm and wouldn’t lose his temper so easily. But after fighting with Lin Yun, his anger hadn't calmed down yet. The Ying River King said, “He wasn’t this strong before.”

They had met before, but Lin Yun had chosen to escape in their last encounter. And yet Lin Yun had transformed after coming out of the Fallen God Valley. He said, “Don’t tell me that there’s opportunities in the Fallen God Valley. We haven’t found Su Ziyao; she might be in the Fallen God Valley. That place is really weird.”

“It doesn’t matter. Even if there are opportunities in the Fallen God Valley, we cannot go down. Our utmost importance right now is the divine flame fragments,” Zhao Tianyu said.

“Any movement from your sect’s divine maiden?” The Ying River King asked.

“You’ll know at that time,” Zhao Tianyu replied. The mantis stalks the cicada while the oriole follows behind.

Under the phoenix fire, while the last restriction was being lifted, the Ming Cult, Heavenly Flame Sect, and Myriad Lightning Sect had gathered to for a secret discussion amongst themselves.

“What if there’s only one divine flame fragment?” The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord asked.

“We might be brothers, but we’ll do things fairly. We’ll just snatch it. Even if we don’t snatch it, the Divine Phoenix Mountain won’t give it to us either way,” Huang Jingyu said. He was optimistic; the divine flames would go to the capable one.

“What if there are two?” The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord asked.

Huang Jingyu smiled, “We still have to snatch them even if there are three. If there are three, we can divide them amongst ourselves. But if there are four, we can share them.”

Huang Jingyu was domineering and confident in himself.

Liu Yunlan cautiously said, “I don’t think that it will be that easy, not to mention that the Blood Moon Sect might return. The Divine Dao Pavilion and Divine Phoenix Mountain might also join forces together. If there are two fragments, we can give one away.”

If they fought amongst themselves, it might benefit the enemies instead. For some reason, Liu Yunlan had a bad feeling in his heart.

“You’re naive!” Huang Jingyu sneered. “You want to give them away, but have you ever thought if they will give it to you? As for the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan, we’ll just have to teach them a lesson if they really return. I don’t believe that the Ying River King is really a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit.”

Liu Yunlan shut his mouth and no longer said a word. The Eastern Desolation was too chaotic now, and the three holy lands had a common interest, so they could cooperate. He didn’t know how the Eastern Desolation had fallen into such chaos.

Liu Yunlan sighed because he knew that the current tribulation was still nothing. The real turmoil would occur when the Radiant Sword Saint undergoes his tribulation. At that time, even Emperor Realm experts might join in.

Right then, the outer layer of the stone monument melted with a blood stench spreading out, accompanied by a dragon's aura.

“Blood! That’s dragon’s blood!”

“The stone monument is actually made of dragon’s blood! Oh my god, what’s going on?”

“Don’t tell me that the blood comes from that Flame Dragon?”

“This is really weird.”

Everyone was focused on the stone monument as it slowly melted, allowing the dragon’s blood to flow. Seeing this in mid-air, Ji Zixi was surprised, “It’s dragon’s blood. Lin Yun was right!”

She subconsciously turned to look at Lin Yun. She saw Lin Yun wearing a grave expression as he looked at the Flame Dragon’s skull.

“Zixi, focus!” The Astral River Saint Lord spoke up.

“Oh, okay.” Ji Zixi recollected herself because this was the crucial and most dangerous moment.

When the stone monument completely melted, the ground exploded with a terrifying chill spreading out and a divine radiance accompanied by a phoenix’s cry. Ji Zixi’s face changed as she waved her hand to recall the Phoenix Fire. Even so, she was a tad slower and threw out a mouthful of blood before she fell from the sky.

The eight Saint Lords around her also threw out a mouthful of blood as they were sent flying away by the aura of the divine flame.

“The divine flame! The divine flame is out!” But no one was concerned about that since their attention was on the ground.

As for Lin Yun and Li Feibai, they dashed forth and came to Ji Zixi’s side.

When the Astral River Saint Lord saw this scene, he couldn’t be concerned about that for now and said with a grave expression, “Flower Burial, please take care of the little princess.”

Before Lin Yun could reply, Li Feibai smiled, “Don’t worry about it. How could he not take care of his future wife?”

The Astral River Saint Lord was furious upon hearing that, but he couldn’t be bothered about that with the emergence of the divine flames. He nodded in Lin Yun’s direction before surrounding the divine flames with those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com
