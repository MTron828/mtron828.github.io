Chapter 2310 - Begging To Give HimVIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Nirvana Dao has five stages: Time-Space Nirvana, Samsara Nirvana, Four Seasons Nirvana, Heaven-Earth Nirvana, and Six Path Nirvana. Each stage contained an unimaginable profundity that was directly linked to dao.

The information in the Nirvana Seal was massive, and he had only absorbed bits of it. But that bit of information was enough to let Lin Yun know why Nirvana Dao was so powerful. He should be in the initial mastery of Time-Space Nirvana, and it was nothing compared to the five stages.

“Slaying a deity in the Saint Realm…” Lin Yun muttered to himself. He fell into deep thoughts and had a feeling that the reason why the Iris Sword Saint could slay a deity while at the Saint Realm must be related to Nirvana Dao. He probably spent more time comprehending Nirvana Dao than in his cultivation, which is why he was still at the Saint Realm.

“Five stages, knowing myself, knowing life and death, knowing the world, knowing heaven and earth, and knowing the origin…” Lin Yun concluded. The power of Nirvana Dao must be really powerful since it even involved the world's origin.

“It looks like it’s not a boast to say that everything has nirvana,” Lil’ Purple exclaimed after listening to Lin Yun’s explanation.

Lin Yun nodded, and it looked like the effort he spent to grasp Nirvana Dao wasn’t in vain. Nirvana Dao and Sword Dao were enough for him to fight those who grasped more saint daos and even kill them.

Lin Yun recollected himself and came over to the Phoenix Tree and was happy to discover that the Othershore Flower had completely grown its bud. The bud looked like crimson flames that formed into a terrifying divine rune on the bud.

“It has finally succeeded.” Lin Yun rejoiced, allowing the Othershore Flower to climb up his palm with a smile.

“This Othershore Flower should be able to rival the Divine Star Flower on Tian Xuanzi’s shoulder, but you’ll need more experience,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Let’s go and meet the Scarlet Radiant Saint Lord,” Lin Yun smiled.

When Lin Yun arrived, the holy master was already waiting. The holy master smiled, “You’re here?”

“Tonight, I wish you to use your full strength,” Lin Yun said as he nodded. The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s holy master would meet him tomorrow, and he probably couldn’t come anymore.

The holy master smiled, “I know. The holy master will meet you tomorrow, and a guest will also be there. Who knows, perhaps we might be able to meet again at that time.”

Lin Yun was surprised but soon calmed down because he had already guessed that the holy master wasn’t a Saint Lord. He said, “It looks like you’re someone close to the holy master. I was guessing that you might be a Saint Sovereign, but it looks like you should be a Great Saint.”

The two had already forgotten their initial bet after so many days. Over the past few days, Lin Yun had received guidance from the holy master. The holy master smiled, “Do your best today. I want to see how far you have reached with the Nirvana Sword Art.”

Lin Yun smiled, “Tonight, I won’t need to use my Nirvana Sword Art. You can just come at me.”

“That will have to depend on your ability,” the holy master smiled. Aside from the first night, he didn’t use the Wind Chime Sword again and mainly focused on defending.

Lin Yun smiled as his eyes became golden. A righteous aura then spread out when he released his Divine Light Sword Intent. The sword aura he gave off soared to the sky, lighting up the surroundings.

After s4eeing the holy master drawing circles with his hands, the Flower Burial Sword flew out from Lin Yun's chest as he charged forth, “This move again?”

When the Flower Burial Sword reached the phoenix master, three dao flowers appeared behind Lin Yun and he empowered his sword with the Sword, Thunder, and Wind Daos.

The holy master repeated what he had done the past few days, clasping his hands together as the surrounding space froze.

“This doesn’t work anymore…” Another dao flower appeared behind Lin Yun, shining with a seven-colored radiance. This was the first time Nirvana Dao appeared and Lin Yun’s sword aura began to rise. In a split second, many flame halos were shattered.

The holy master was surprised and retreated. Whenever he stepped back, a phoenix cry would echo as the flames in his hands grew even more powerful. But it was futile because Lin Yun’s sword easily shattered all the flames.

When the Flower Burial Sword returned to Lin Yun’s hand, blood dripped from the sword's tip. On the other hand, the holy master had a sword wound left on his face, which was the power of an Eternal Dao. Just because it was an Eternal Dao, Lin Yun didn’t need any trick or sword technique to easily resolve his defenses.

“Everything is nothing before nirvana.” The holy master wiped the blood off his lips, and smiled. Not only was he not disappointed, he even looked more excited. He smiled, “You have finally succeeded.”

“Time for you to draw your sword,” Lin Yun said.

The holy master waved his hand, “Forget about it. I only have one sword, the Listening Wind Chime.”

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun was surprised.

“When I traveled around the world when I was younger, I forgot this sword technique at the age of three hundred and only remembered the Listening Wind Chime,” the holy master explained.

Lin Yun was shocked because this was fusing the sword technique and comprehension into one sword, a stage that he wanted to achieve. As a swordsman, Lin Yun knew how tough it was.

“After three hundred years old, I stopped practicing sword techniques. You must be curious ab9ut why I can resist Divine Light Sword Intent, right? That’s not only the number of saint daos, but something else,” the holy master said.

“I have already suspected that. Regardless of your cultivation, you shouldn’t be able to withstand Divine Light Sword Intent since you suppressed your cultivation into a Saint Lord,” Lin Yun said. He might not have released his Sword Domain, but his Sword Dao empowered it. So, it wasn’t something that could be easily blocked.

“Take a finger from me if you’re interested,” the holy master smiled. “If you can take it and remain standing, you can borrow the Sinful Fire Divine Rune.”

“Okay,” Lin Yun agreed.

“Look carefully.” The holy master pointed with his finger, which formed into a beam of flames, piercing through the air, reaching before Lin Yun, and giving off an aura comparable to a Saint Sovereign’s attack.

Lin Yun felt great pressure and was surprised because the holy master accomplished this while sealing his cultivation to a Saint Lord. The power of this finger was comparable to the attack of a Saint Sovereign. Before thinking more about it, Lin Yun retreated while executing Nirvana Dao.

As Lin Yun began to spin in the air, he returned to the past along with the holy master’s attack. In a breath, Lin Yun swung ninety-nine swords, each weakening the power of that finger. When Lin Yun returned to the previous moment, the power of this finger was reduced to an attack of a sixth-stage Saint Lord. It was still powerful, but not as powerful as before.

“Break!” Lin Yun activated four glory spirits in the Flower Burial Sword and severed that beam into two. When he completed everything, his forehead was covered in sweat, with his energy completely consumed, nearly exhausting all his saint energy and sword intent.

The holy master waved his hand and praised, “To be able to fend off this sword when you’ve just stepped into the threshold of Nirvana Dao, you’re a genius.”

When Lin Yun raised his head, he discovered that the holy master also had a seven-colored flower blooming behind him. He instantly recognized it, and exclaimed, “Time Dao!”

That finger unleashed by the holy master was empowered with Time Dao. So he now knew why his Divine Light Sword Intent couldn’t break it. Time Dao was an Eternal Dao, while the Sword Dao was a Sovereign Dao. It was only natural that he couldn’t obtain any advantage in the clash. Lin Yun cursed, “You lied!”

“Go back and rest well. I have agreed to it,” the holy master smiled.

Lin Yun looked at the ashes on the stage and wasn’t afraid that the holy master would go back on his word. He merely cupped his hands together and left. When he left, the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign appeared with shock on his face. He muttered, “This is unbelievable. He has already entered the threshold?”

“So, is he worth a Lesser Blue Dragon Medal?” The holy master asked.

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign was baffled, but said, “I’m curious about how he could have improved so quickly. He was still struggling to enter the threshold a few days ago and had already grasped it. He shouldn’t have improved so quickly, even if he's a genius.”

“That’s because he’s the successor of that Iris Sword Saint,” the holy master sighed with a complicated gaze. Since he had guessed Lin Yun’s relationship with the Iris Sword Saint, he naturally guessed the identity of that mysterious ‘Senior.’

“This…” The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign was shocked.

“So, is he worth it?” The holy master asked.

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign sighed, “I can’t help but feel admiration. After all, he accomplished something not even the Nine Emperors could do.”

“The Sacred Alliance dreams of reforging the Heavenly Path, and the hope is on him. So don’t bother putting your stake on others,” the holy master said.

“I will meet him with you when the day arrives,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign said with anxiety in his eyes.

“What about the Lesser Blue Dragon Medal?” The holy master smiled.

“Don’t worry about it. I will beg him to accept it even if he doesn’t want it,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign said.
