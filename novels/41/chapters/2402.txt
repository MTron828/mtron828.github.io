Chapter 2403 - Confidence

Feng Yuan’s words left everyone in an uproar, dumbfounded by what he said. Luo Tianxi was the sect master of Heaven’s Gate, and he represented the face of Heaven’s Gate. So, what Feng Yuan said was no different from slapping Luo Tianxi’s face.

In the next second, a powerful aura swept out as all the elders flew into the sky and coldly looked at Feng Yuan. Profound Sky Venerable’s face was cold, and he wanted to slap Feng Yuan on his face, “The sect master doesn’t have to make a move to deal with someone like you, and I’m more than enough.”

“Stop.” Luo Tianxi said as he pushed his palm forth, sending Profound Sky Venerable flying away.

“Emperor!” Profound Sky Venerable said with reluctance.

“No one is allowed to make a move,” Luo Tianxi said coldly. At the same time, he grasped his hand in the sky and the sky began to recover as though he had the entire sky in his palm, shocking everyone and leaving them dumbfounded.

All the elders who soared to the sky were suppressed, with the entire Heavenly Saint Courtyard becoming silent. Luo Tianxi merely swept his gaze to intimidate everyone. When he looked at Feng Yuan, his expression was replaced with a smile, and he sighed, “It seems like the Dao Sect has produced a talent. I have already given my answer when your sect masters came to look for me, and I won’t hand over Lin Yun. Since this is a matter between youngsters, it should be resolved amongst youngsters, not to mention that Lin Yun would soon become the ancestral deity’s disciple. Just because he was from the Kunlun Realm, the Heaven’s Gate, won’t allow him to be bullied by other immortal holy lands.”

“That’s why we’re here,” Feng Yuan said.

Bai Yuchen spoke out, “Emperor, we admire you, but this matter involves the honor of our forces, and we have no choice but to come. So I apologize.”

“We’re here for Lin Yun and not Heaven's Gate,” Jiang Yi said. The three heaved a sigh in relief after seeing that Luo Tianxi wouldn’t make a move against them, especially Jiang Yi and Bai Yuchen. After all, the Heavenly Sword Pavilion and Shadow Divine Palace’s foundation were lacking in comparison to Heaven’s Gate, and they wouldn’t have dared to come so openly if it wasn’t for Feng Yuan.

The three were here for a long time, waiting for Lin Yun to be defeated before bringing him away. Not only did Lin Yun not lose a fight, but he even shone brightly and suppressed everyone, becoming the champion. So, seeing that Lin Yun was about to be brought to the ancestral deity, they had no choice but to stand out.

“The three of them are really arrogant. This is the same as if saying that there’s no challenge amongst the younger generation of Heaven’s Gate, and no one can stop them from taking Lin Yun with them.

“It’s rare to see the three of them. Only Ye Wuhen can compete with them, but he’s still too young.”

“It looks like the Dao Sect really hates Lin Yun.”

“It won’t be easy for Lin Yun now.”

Everyone could sense the rage behind Luo Tianxi’s composure, and this made the entire Heaven’s Gate furious as well. After all, this had nothing to do with Lin Yun with the situation coming this far. The three of them were simply slapping the face of Heaven’s Gate. It didn’t matter if they had that intention, but that was what they were doing.

“Senior Brother Feng, there’s no need to put up with them!”

“They’re too arrogant. Did they think that there’s no one in Heaven’s Gate?”

“To cause a mess in the Heavenly Barren Banquet, there’s no need for them to keep any face for Heaven’s Gate.”

The geniuses of Heaven’s Gate weren’t cowards, and they all became agitated.

Lin Yun frowned and was surprised because these three were here for him, but they were facing the geniuses of Heaven’s Gate instead of him, so he became neglected.

“Big Brother Lin, what should we do?” Ji Zixi asked.

“Let’s just watch for now,” Lin Yun said. It wasn’t appropriate for him to make a move now, so he could only watch.

Feng Bumao looked at Feng Yuan with a dark expression. He coldly said, “Who gave you the courage to come to Heaven’s Gate? Don’t even dream about it! You think there’s no one in Heaven’s Gate capable of facing you?”

To say that they wanted to take Lin Yun away in the Heavenly Saint Courtyard was something no disciples from Heaven’s Gate could bear.

Feng Yuan said nothing while Jiang Yi stood out, “We don’t dare. If Heaven’s Gate wants to stop us, I don’t mind fighting with you guys!”

A figure soared to the sky, and he roared, “Heavenly Saint Courtyard’s Bai Ye! Let me face you!”

The moment he finished speaking, Bai Ye charged forth with heaven and earth trembling. A massive sword appeared behind him, with his sword aura rising. He drew a sword arc that looked like a crescent moon, shining brightly. Space was severed into two since Bai Ye wasn’t holding back.

“What pitiful tricks!” Jiang Yi pushed his palm forth when he landed on the ground. He looked like he was slapping a fly when he waved his hand, sending Bai Ye flying away. When Bai Ye fell to the ground, his sword ray shattered with a palm print on his chest.

The massive sword behind Bai Ye shattered, and he threw out a mouthful of blood. This made everyone take in a cold breath because they didn’t expect Bai Ye to be defeated so quickly. Anyone could tell that Bai Ye was cannon fodder for probing the three's strength on behalf of Feng Bumao and the others.

But no one expected that Bai Ye couldn’t even take a single attack. This instantly made the faces of all the ancestral deity’s disciples grave. Ye Wuhen couldn’t hold himself back, but Xia Qingyun held him down, stopping him from fighting.

Feng Bumao swept a gaze as a few more holy sons from the various courtyards stepped out, but all of them were defeated. Nine holy sons out of thirty-six holy sons were defeated, and they all suffered fatal injuries. Even with the help of elixirs, it would take a long time for them to recover.

But those three held back and didn’t take anyone’s life, making everyone from Heaven’s Gate feel grievance. Everyone had calmed down now and knew that these three came prepared.

“Is that the strength of a divine son? Isn’t he too strong?”

“There’s a huge difference between a divine son and a holy son. A holy son can only receive the resources of one courtyard, while a divine son can receive the resources from the entire sect.”

“Who’s the divine son from Heaven’s Gate?”

“Ye Wuhen, but he’s still too young.”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“What about the previous one?”

“You think that it’s so easy to nurture a divine son? You need someone talented enough to be nurtured into a divine son.” Discussions resounded from the surroundings, and they finally realized how serious the situation was. Their eyes were filled with fear when they looked at Jiang Yi.

“If this is the best you guys can offer, no one can stop us today,” Jiang Yi said, making everyone from Heaven’s Gate grit their teeth.

“The Shadow Divine Palace is too much!” Jiang Yi’s arrogance enraged a disciple of the ancestral deity, and he charged forth. This made everyone’s eyes light up because those who made a move earlier were holy sons.

This person was Zhang Yu. He was accepted as the ancestral deity’s disciple ten years ago, and he was also a talented genius.

A cold light flashed in Jiang Yi’s eyes. He wanted to make an example out of this person to establish prestige. Zhang Yu might be the disciple of the ancestral deity, but the ancestral deity had over a hundred direct disciples, while the Shadow Divine Palace only had one divine son.

He was destined to take over the Shadow Divine Palace in the future, so he naturally wouldn’t allow himself to be provoked by Zhang Yu. A seal bloomed on his forehead, and Zhang Yu was struck with a palm before he could even get close. This palm was simple, but it gave off a powerful aura, sending Jiang Yu flying away.

As Zhang Yu’s saint energy dissipated, his constellation shattered before it could even open up, and he was bleeding profusely when he landed on the ground. Everyone was shocked by the scene in which Jiang Yi’s palm penetrated Zhang Yu’s chest.

When Zhang Yu fainted, everyone took a deep breath, their complexion becoming pale since this was too terrifying.

Jiang Yi stood with his hands behind him. He said, “You guys have to understand something. Don’t think you guys are invincible just because you became the ancestral deity’s disciple. Since we’re here, we naturally have our confidence in doing so. Don’t embarrass the ancestral deity if this is the best you can do.”

The surroundings fell into silence upon hearing that. His words were no different from openly provoking the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity.
