Chapter 344 - Cosmic Artifact’s Prowess

The tip of the flag tore through the resisting air and dragged Lin Yun towards the black-clothed man. The flag was fast, which caught the black-clothed man by surprise. He never expected that Lin Yun had a cosmic artifact prepared.

He didn't have any time to think and circulated all the origin energy within his body to condense nine thick shields before him. But the triangular tip of the flag easily broke through the nine shields. After all, how could the shields he created in a hurry block the attack that Lin Yun had been accumulating?

But the shields still managed to obtain some time for the black-clothed man. He fused his dracophant energy and origin energy together to condense a purple armor on his chest. When the flag collided with the armor, cracks instantly started to spread out under the huge force. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The black-clothed man threw up a mouthful of blood and he was sent flying away. Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he looked at the armor. Were they still trying to deny the fact that they were from the Primal Origin Sect even after revealing the Dracophant Battle Physique?

Circulating the Iris Sword Sutra, Lin Yun took three steps forward. He didn’t give his opponent the opportunity to gain his footing and swung the flag.

The black-clothed man was shocked when he saw this scene. He had just reached the Violet Palace Realm, so it was foolish for him to compete with cosmic artifacts. He immediately circulated the origin energy within his body and took a step back.

But before he could even let out a breath of relief, blazing flames swept out from the flag that sent the black-clothed man flying. Even he was nearly ignited by the flames.

“Damn it…how is this cosmic artifact so powerful!” The black-clothed man was shocked. It made no sense that a cosmic artifact could be so powerful in the hands of someone in the seventh stage of the Profound Martial Realm.

Honestly speaking, Lin Yun could barely control the Scarletflame War Flag in its long-range form. But there weren't so many restrictions for the close-combat form. Lin Yun was able to control it when he was in the fifth stage, not to mention that he was in the seventh stage now.

As origin energy poured into the Scarletflame War Flag, Lin Yun moved like an ancient beast.

“Die!” Before the black-clothed man could even think about anything, Lin Yun charged forward and jabbed with his flag. Turning into a crimson beam, Lin Yun was carried by the momentum of the flag and turned into a crimson ray that traveled over a few hundred meters in an instant.

The purple armor that the black-clothed man had manifested was pierced through. When Lin Yun drew out the flag, blood started flowing out from the wound created by the Scarletflame War Flag’s triangular tip.That attack had pierced through the black-clothed man’s defense and into his body by half an inch.

The black-clothed man clutched his chest and threw up a few mouthfuls of blood. The armor that was manifested from his dracophant energy and origin energy swiftly collapsed.

Like a wild beast, the Scarletflame War Flag became excited when it was drenched in blood. The spiritual runes on the flag pole lit up and unleashed an outburst of ominous aura.

Lin Yun looked at the ground and it became covered by piles of bones. At this moment, Lin Yun was having difficulty distinguishing between reality and illusion. He locked his brows together and poured his origin energy into it the Scarletflame War Flag, but he couldn’t satisfy the cosmic artifact’s appetite no matter how much he tried.

While the Scarletflame War Flag gave him power, it also had a high demand. If Lin Yun used it recklessly, he wouldn’t be able to restrain the ferocity of the cosmic artifact. He still wasn’t strong enough to control it, so he had to use it moderately.

But first I have to kill one. Lin Yun’s gaze fell on the black-clothed man with torrential killing intent blazing in his eyes. The black-clothed man was ultimately an expert in the Violet Palace Realm, but Lin Yun managed to survive the two attacks because of the cosmic artifact.

“Elder Wen, save me!” The black-clothed man yelled out in despair.

“What’s wrong?” Wen Yanbo’s face sank when he turned his gaze over. He was deeply shocked in his heart when he saw Lin Yun’s cosmic artifact.

“Sword slave, don’t you dare!” Wen Yanbo threw a palm at Luo Feng before he rushed over to the black-clothed man. A surging aura swept out from him as he balled his fist and threw a punch at the Scarletflame War Flag.

The ground exploded with countless stones flying out from the shockwave that was created from the clashing attacks. Blood seeped out of Lin Yun’s mouth and both he and the Scarletflam War Flag were blown away.

“You’re courting death!” Luo Feng dashed over and landed a palm on Wen Yanbo’s chest. When his palm imprinted on Wen Yanbo’s chest, the sounds of bones cracking could be heard. Right at this moment, Sword Condors emitting powerful sword aura appeared in the distant horizon.

Wen Yanbo knew that he no longer had an opportunity to kill Lin Yun. He quickly yelled, “Retreat!”

The remaining three black-clothed men immediately started to retreat upon receiving the command. But the black-clothed man who was injured by Lin Yun was trailing at the very end. Decisively, Luo Feng tapped his finger out and shot out a dazzling beam, “Firmament Finger!”

In the next second, the beam pierced through the black-clothed man and claimed his life. The black-clothed man’s body swelled and exploded.

When Wen Yanbo turned around to see this scene, his eyes surged with hatred and he quickened his footsteps.

“Junior brother, are you alright?” Xin Yan rushed over.

Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips. Just as he was about to squeeze out a smile, he was suddenly assaulted by a surge of dizziness and then he staggered. Xin Yan quickly helped him gain his footing.

Right at this moment, Luo Feng came like the wind and tapped on Lin Yun’s chest three times. Each time he tapped, he would pour his origin energy into Lin Yun’s body. When the origin energy poured into Lin Yun’s body, the Iris Sword Sutra that was withering suddenly glowed and opened up.

Lin Yun opened his eyes and gave Luo Feng a grateful look.

“Elder Luo, he’s…” Xin Yan wanted to ask, but before she could finish her words, she was interrupted by Luo Feng.

“He’s fine. He just over exerted himself using the cosmic artifact.” Luo Feng took a deep glance at Lin Yun. He was shocked that Lin Yun could bring out so much power from the cosmic artifact, which made him curious about Lin Yun’s cultivation technique that could sustain the cosmic artifact’s consumption. If it was someone else in Lin Yun’s shoes, they would have already turned into a mummy by now.

“It’s not a big deal, but don’t be reckless again in the future,” said Luo Feng.

Lin Yun nodded his head. He didn’t have a choice back then because there was no way he could fight against an expert in the Violet Palace Realm.

“But thanks to you, we managed to kill a Violet Palace Realm elder from the Primal Origin Sect. This should teach them a lesson,” sneered Luo Feng.

A middle-aged man wearing the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s uniform suddenly descended from the Sword Condor. He cupped his hands together and said, “Greetings, Elder Luo.”

Luo Feng nodded. Then, his eyes with a ruthless light and he gave a command, “Send out a notification that Wen Yanbo is heavily injured. He won’t be able to leave this place within the next three days, so we have to capture him.”

“Roger!” The middle-aged swordsman nodded and left on the Sword Condor.

“Elder Luo.” Xin Jue came over with the interspatial pouch from the black-clothed man that died.

Casually sifting through the interspatial pouch, Luo Feng took out a jade tablet. He looked at Lin Yun with a smile, “This is a secret technique from the Primal Origin Sect. You should be interested in it.”

Lin Yun took it and looked over it. It truly was a secret technique. It was the purple armor that the black-clothed man had previously used. This was a unique technique that merged the dracophant energy and origin energy together to manifest the dracophant armor. Lin Yun knew how powerful this secret technique was since it could even withstand an attack from the Scarletflame War Flag.

“Thank you, Elder.”

“No need to thank me. You’re the one who injured him. Not to mention that this secret technique is related to the Dracophant Battle Physique, so only you can cultivate it.”

Supporting Lin Yun, Xin Yan grumbled, “Is the Primal Origin Sect insane? Why the hell are they trying to kill junior brother?”

Tang Tong and the other disciples were also confused. Right at this moment, Luo Feng sighed, “The enmity between the Primal Origin Sect and the Sword Firmament Pavilion runs deep. The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s location once belonged to the Primal Origin Sect. Back then, our ancestor, Jian Wuming, wanted to establish a sect and took a liking to the Primal Origin Sect’s location. So he casually got rid of the entire Primal Origin Sect. But our ancestor had a soft heart, so he didn’t kill all of them.

“For a long period of time, the Primal Origin Sect didn’t dare to do anything. But when the Heavenly Profound Sect and Demonic Moon Villa rose up to fame, the Sword Firmament Pavilion was no longer able to monopolize the Great Qin Empire. At that moment, the Primal Origin Sect made their return. So they have been targeting the geniuses from the Sword Firmament Pavilion for the past few centuries. They did not want to see the Sword Firmament Pavilion rise up again…”

Lin Yun instantly understood the enmity between the two sects. No wonder the two sects had such great enmity. At the same time, he was shocked when he heard that the ancestor, Jian Wuming, had suppressed the entire Primal Origin Sect by himself.
