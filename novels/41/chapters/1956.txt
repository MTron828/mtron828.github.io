Lin Yun was engulfed in flames as the profound death and a profound life auras violently clashed within his violet palace. His dragon origin was slowly being transformed into the nirvana aura as the two energies clashed. The entire process took two days and two nights, and his internal organs underwent a different degree of impact, with flames blazing around his body.

The flames might look sacred, but they contained significant lethality. Lin Yun ultimately managed to bear it, breaking through the boundaries of the Profound Death Stage and reaching the Nirvana Stage. At this moment, he was a King in the Samsara Edict Realm, reaching the pinnacle of the mortal’s path.

As spiritual energy endlessly poured into his body, he circulated his cultivation techniques, and they flowed through his meridians and ten profound pulses. His bones began to crackle, but this was a completely different feeling, with a sense of satisfaction spreading throughout his body.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his injuries from his battle with the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf had recovered, and his strength reached a new height.

This is the Nirvana Stage? With my current cultivation, I won’t have to use my sword intent if I face the likes of Ye Feifan again, and killing him wouldn’t be an issue. The nirvana aura within his violet palace rumbled and filled every corner of his body with a single thought.

With a significant boost in his cultivation, Lin Yun became even more fearless within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and his aura reached a new height.

“Restrain yourself a little. You look a little terrifying now,” Ye Guhan said.

Lin Yun smiled and supressed all the nirvana aura into his body before cupping his hands towards Ye Guhan as a form of gratitude.

“We’re family, so we do not need to be so polite to each other. Now, do you know that I didn’t con you?” Ye Guhan smiled, crunching on the Divine Dragon Fruit.

“No, you didn’t,” Lin Yun smiled. He actually calmed down a long time ago. He only had some complaints because of the tough fight with the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf.

“Haha. Smile and have some fruit.” Ye Guhan looked at Lin Yun before handing over a Divine Dragon Fruit.

“Senior Brother, how many Divine Dragon Fruits do you have?” Lin Yun asked, baffled. His senior brother seemed to have an endless flow of Divine Dragon Fruits.

“Actually… I took an entire Divine Dragon Tree. Hahaha!” Ye Guhan laughed.

Lin Yun couldn’t help sweating upon hearing that. He couldn’t believe that a Saint Sovereign had gone to steal a tree just for a bite.

When he looked down the mountain, the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf was nowhere to be seen on the altar, and the other demonic wolves had also gone missing. Since he was curious about the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf’s harvest, he asked, “How’s the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf?”

“Not bad,” Ye Guhan replied. “He has officially stepped into the threshold of the saint path. The Quasi-Saint Realm has nine stages and only three phases in general. They’re the Azure Origin Phase, Indigo Origin Phase, and the Heavenly Origin Phase. The saint aura would also change according to the different phases respectively. So this means each three stages are a threshold, and the saint aura will become golden after reaching the Heavenly Origin Phase and congealing the Natal Sacred Flames.”

“Natal Sacred Flames?” Lin Yun asked with his brows furrowed.

“Yeah. The Natal Sacred Flames are the initial form of saint origin. If one can’t congeal the saint origin, one will be stuck in the Quasi-Saint Realm for the rest of their lifetime. But even the Natal Sacred Flames are enough to suppress other Quasi-Saints, and it can tear through any martial intents, including sword intent,” Ye Guhan said.

When he heard that, Lin Yun immediately felt a headache and sighed, “Is this the true strength of a Quasi-Saint? There are so many paths to take.”

“The Quasi-Saint’s path isn’t easy, but neither is the Nirvana Stage. Each transformation of nirvana aura is washing away your mortality; it’ll only becomes tougher as you go. If you make a mistake, you can lose your life at the Nirvana Stage,” Ye Guhan said. “But each transformation will bring your nirvana aura closer to the saint aura, and I don’t have any words to describe this feeling.”

But nirvana aura wasn’t the saint aura, and one would require an astronomical sum of resources to complete the transformation. Furthermore, they also needed great courage and talent since every transformation was a new beginning, and the difficulty would increase. The first four transformations were still alright, but would change after the fourth one.

Ye Guhan smiled, “Furthermore, Quasi-Saints are also known as False Saints. You have to know that the Saint Realm represents the pinnacle in the world, as long as those in the Emperor Realm don’t appear. They will come to possess a life span of over a thousand years, so the path in the Quasi-Saint Realm is naturally tough. From a certain degree, a Quasi-Saint has also stepped on the Saint Realm, and they have transcended.”

“What is the level of the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf that I previously faced?” Lin Yun asked embarrassedly.

“None. Its saint aura has yet to transform. So its saint aura is colorless and crude. Because it doesn’t have a cultivation technique, the true power of the saint aura wasn’t unleashed,” Ye Guhan explained.

Lin Yun fell silent because he had just reached the Nirvana Stage and had a long way to go.

“Don’t belittle any Quasi-Saint, unless you intend to go all out with your life on the line. You must be careful, even if you have a Sovereign Saint Artifact,” Ye Guhan continued. “I did this because I wanted you to temper your Sword Heart. I'll be at fault if you belittle any Quasi-Saints because of it.”

“I understand,” Lin Yun replied.

“No. I bet you still don’t know,” Ye Guhan said. “The Ye Clan will continue to target you in the future, and I can’t protect you every second. This is why I got you to fight a Quasi-Saint monarch demonic beast and let you reach the Nirvana Stage so quicky.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun instantly understood his senior brother’s efforts.

“Time waits for no one. I hope you can shine in the upcoming Golden Era and not disappoint the Radiant Sword Saint’s lineage.”

“I won’t let down our lineage.” Lin Yun and Ye Guhan exchanged a look. Ye Guhan smiled before they grasped their hands together.

When Lin Yun returned to Indigo Thunder Peak, he only rested for a day, then it was time for him to go to the Nether Orchid Courtyard. He got Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red to enter the Iris Secret Realm before carrying the sword box on his back.

Lin Yun already promised Lil’ Purple that he would probe the secrets of the Solar Lunar Divine Rune after reaching the Nether Orchid Courtyard. Along the way, Lin Yun noticed many people looking at him with weird gazes.

After all, his act of slapping the Azure Solar Saint Lord had long spread throughout the Heavenly Dao Sect. The Ye Clan also went insane, and the ancestor declared that Ye Qingtian was expelled from the clan. This meant Ye Qingtian wasn’t allowed to claim himself to be a member of the Ye Clan.

Ten-odd saint disciples of the Ye Clan even declared they couldn’t take this lying down and wanted to teach Ye Qingtian a lesson. In addition to offending Zhang Yue, and his unclear relationship with the two holy maidens, this was no different from offending the four big clans in the sect as an abandoned member of the Ye Clan.

To a certain degree, the four big clans’ will could be considered the Heavenly Dao Sect’s will.

“Ye Qingtian.” A purple-robed swordsman walked over when the Nether Orchid Courtyard was just in his view.

Lin Yun didn’t recognize this person and asked, “You know me?”

“No one in the Heavenly Dao Sect doesn’t know about you, and your name has even begun to spread throughout the Eastern Desolation as a genius swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect,” the purple-robed swordsman smiled.

“I am Yuan Chen. Like you, I’ve come to the Nether Orchid Courtyard to learn from the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and I’m from the Lower Nine Peaks.”

This man was also heading to the Nether Orchid Courtyard, and it was no wonder this person would call out to him. Lin Yun smiled, “The Lower Nine Peaks?”

The Heavenly Dao Sect had two palaces, three courtyards, and a hundred and eight peaks. The Dao Yang Palace and Heavenly Yin Palace naturally had the highest positions. As for the three courtyards, they have their own inheritance, and the master of the three courtyards were either great saints, sword saints, or heavenly spiritualists.

Their position wasn’t inferior to the two palaces, and their disciples were also usually aloof. As for the hundred and eight peaks, their strength differed significantly from the top nine peaks, known as the Upper Nine Peaks. The Lower Nine Peaks was an imaginary number because the other peaks other than the Upper Nine Peaks were considered the Lower Nine Peaks. There was no specific gauge in the sect, and everyone naturally acknowledged this saying.

“Where will the meeting be held?” Lin Yun asked.

“The Solar Jade Palace, which is also the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s residence,” Yuan Chen said in excitement upon mentioning it.
