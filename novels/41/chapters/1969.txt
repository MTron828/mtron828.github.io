Chapter 1970 - Reflect On Yourself (2)

When the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint arrived, Ye Qingtian still wasn’t found anywhere. But everyone suppressed the doubts in their hearts and focused on the lecture. Four hours later, after the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint left, everyone finally couldn’t suppress their doubts.

“Why didn’t Ye Qingtian come today?”

“Don’t tell me that he’s afraid? After all, he fled so quickly the other day. I bet he’s afraid Big Brother Qinghong will go after him…”

“I think Martial Aunt most likely chased him away!”

“After all, he dared to be disrespectful to Martial Aunt in public. Martial Aunt might not say anything, but she must have disliked him.”

“He’s just a lecher.” The news of Ye Qingtian being kicked out by the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint spread like wildfire. But these people didn’t know that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had landed on the plaza before a Dustless Palace after she left the Solar Jade Palace.

On the plaza, Lin Yun had divided himself into six, executing the same sword technique, the Divine Firefly Sword.

But the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint soon squinted her pupils because she noticed something wasn’t right. It turned out that the sword forms executed by Lin Yun weren’t the same. They might be the Divine Firefly Sword and the same sword form, but each sword's order and intent differed.

Amidst the chaos, Lin Yun swung his sword with the surrounding space overlapping. The power of Lin Yun’s sword also increased with the clouds changing colors.

This made the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint dazed, and she could see the shadows of the Radiant Sword Saint on Lin Yun. Time seemed messed up within the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s eyes as the Radiant Sword Saint turned around and smiled.

“Ziyuan, what do you think of my sword technique? I can easily break the sword technique that you executed yesterday.”

“You… have been practicing the sword the entire night? Is that how you are unwilling to lose to me?”

“Nah. I don’t need a night to solve your sword technique.”

“There’s a layer of frost on your hair…”

“It’s just sword frost, not from the cold. Come, let’s try again today. I’m not someone who will give up so easily.”

Lin Yun sheathed his sword and discovered that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had arrived. He smiled, “Martial Aunt, what do you think of my sword technique?”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint came to her senses, and her facial expression became gentle. She asked, “You’ve been practicing your sword the entire night?”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Of course. I won’t admit my loss so easily,” Lin Yun said.

But when he finished, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint became furious and sneered, “Your Radiant’s lineage is still the same as before. Can’t afford to lose? So what if you lost once?!”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint held onto the brush and began writing down on the paper. There were eighteen inked figures this time, and the difficulty had tripled compared to yesterday, wanting to teach Lin Yun a lesson.

Lin Yun spent the next few days like that. He might be practicing his sword but was receiving a one-sided beating. Whenever Lin Yun felt he could cope with the pace, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint would increase the difficulty and wouldn’t give him any time to catch his breath.

In just seven days, the six-inked figures increased to seventy-two, and Lin Yun could sense that his Divine Firefly Sword was improving daily. He even drastically improved the Divine Firefly Sword, and his strength would improve by leaps and bounds every time he broke his limit.

But this inhumane way of teaching not only made Lin Yun feel exhausted in his physique, but also in his mental state. There were several times Lin Yun almost couldn’t hold on and wanted to bring out the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, Golden Crow Wings, Sovereign Constellation, and even the Sovereign Dragon Seal.

But he ultimately gritted his teeth and bore it down. Even so, he had to admit that his harvest for the past few days was incredible. In just a few days, his Divine Firefly Sword reached the miniscule stage.

He also had his own understanding of the Divine Firefly Sword and now understood why he couldn’t master the Myriad Swords Unite. The essence of the Myriad Swords Unite wasn’t to combine all the sword forms but to reach a new height in the power of his sword forms.

The true profundity laid in unity, meaning he had to return to zero. He had to forget all twelve sword forms and return to the first sword form—Firefly Radiance, like a loop.

It might seem like returning to the original point, but after the circle was drawn, the Firefly Radiance would become different when he executed it again.

On the eighth day, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was hovering in the sky as she watched Lin Yun practicing his sword technique.

On the plaza, Lin Yun took twelve steps out, leaving behind an afterimage with each step, and each of his afterimages would swing out a sword.

As the afterimages condensed, they looked like the entire cycle of that firefly’s life. The sword techniques also progressed from the Firefly Radiance, Heavenly Snowing Mountain, Silver Blood…

The afterimages complete an entire cycle.

When Lin Yun took the thirteenth step forth, he returned to the original spot, and all the afterimages overlapped. All the afterimages turned into the Firefly Radiance before Lin Yun thrusted his sword forth.

His sword looked as though it was alive. It couldn’t be extinguished, and the Dustless Palace began to tremble.

“I have finally mastered the Myriad Swords Unite!” Lin Yun rejoiced and felt that all his hard work was worth it. When he thrust his sword out earlier, the surrounding space trembled, and he felt like a new door had opened.

After he mastered the thirteenth sword form, he discovered that there was still another volume of the Divine Firefly Sword. The thirteen sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword were only a key to open the gate to the genuine Divine Firefly Sword.

He now looked forward to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s arrival. When he raised his head, he saw the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. He said, “Martial aunt, I mastered the thirteenth sword form—Myriad Swords Unite!”

“Spending seven days to master it, it looks like Radiant has taken in a foolish disciple.” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was inwardly shocked despite what she said. It took Bai Shuying an entire month to master the thirteenth sword form, but Lin Yun only used seven.

Having cold water pouring down on him, Lin Yun was already used to it and smiled, “Martial Aunt, what else do you have to teach me?”

“Ye Qingtian, let me ask you. How many words have I written over the past seven days?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked.

“This…” Lin Yun frowned because he really didn’t pay attention to that.

“You’re like a dead wood that cannot be carved! You don’t even know how many words I’ve written. Jian Wuming might be stupid like a pig, but he wouldn’t be so distracted,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, “Remember carefully. I have written thirty-six words. I will punish you to reflect on yourself for three days!”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint twirled her hand, and the papers she wore opened up like a painting. There were thirty-six paintings, meaning thirty-six ancient words, and the words were like a cage that trapped Lin Yun within it. Each painting emitted a majestic saint radiance.

“Martial Aunt…” Lin Yun immediately felt a headache. But when he raised his head, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint simply ignored him and left.
