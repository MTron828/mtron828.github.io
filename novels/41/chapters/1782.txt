Chapter 1783 - Silver Dragon Saint Physique

After Yi Feng won his battle with the Blue Frost Lord, he was called down to the stage by his senior brother. Yi Feng still wanted to fight, but his senior brother was worried he might get over his head because of his young age.

As the Martial Dao Tea Party continued, more of the top ten would occasionally go onto the stage. The Heavenly Flame Sect’s Yan Chihuo, Divine Dao Pavilion’s Lin Qingyang, and Ming Cult’s Yu Wenxiu all went onto the stage. The Cloud Swordsman also fought as well, challenging the Snow Master Lord of the Four Young Masters.

It was an intense fight, but it didn’t take long for him to be defeated. The Snow Master Lord might seem low-profiled, but that didn’t mean he was weak. He was in the top ten for a reason.

Several battles later, no one dared to challenge the top ten anymore. This further made everyone feel that the top ten were on a whole new level, and those weren’t people they could face. This naturally made many people disappointed because the top ten would be those they had guessed before the Martial Dao Tea Party started. The top ten would only be monopolized by the Four Young Masters and holy lands’ geniuses.

As for the exact rankings, it could only be determined between the top ten and had nothing to do with everyone else.

As long as these people didn’t make a breakthrough to the Samsara Edict Realm, no one would be able to stand out on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. But these people would definitely feel despair because Jian Jingtian was also in the Samsara Edict Realm, and he was invincible within the Eastern Desolation as long as saints did not show up. Thus, they could only be suppressed by him at that time.

After several battles that were lacking luster, the Wind Edge Lord of the Four Young Masters went on the stage again. He declared, “Yan Chihuo, do you dare to fight me?”

The Wind Edge Lord did not choose Yi Feng but Yan Chihuo, causing a decent uproar. After all, Yan Chihuo was more famous than Yi Feng. The latter defeated the Blue Frost Lord earlier, so the Wind Edge Lord wanted to win a round as a representative of the Four Young Masters.

“The Wind Edge Lord wants to challenge Yan Chihuo? He has ambitions. Yan Chihuo is at least in the top five on the Dragon Pulse Ranking!”

“It’s publicly known that the Wind Edge Lord has a great ambition, and I’ve heard that he’s behind why the Martial Dao Tea Party was brought forward.”

“But if he loses, his journey in the Martial Dao Tea Party will come to an end.”

“Not bad, but he will practically have to say farewell to the top three if he reveals too much.”

In the Heavenly Flame Sect’s pavilion, Yan Chihuo grinned, “Wind Edge Lord, you’re pretty bold. Even if you defeat me, you will also lose your chance to continue climbing up the rankings!”

“How narcissistic. Since I dared to challenge you, I naturally have the confidence to quickly deal with you.” The Wind Edge Lord smiled. He was calm and composed, and everyone could sense the confidence and dominance within his tone. As he spoke, a powerful aura swept out from him that made the sky turn dark.

When Yan Chihuo sensed the aura the Wind Edge Lord was emitting, his face gradually became grave. They both appeared on the Thunderblood Battlestage and were a thousand meters away, looking at each other with their auras clashing.

This made Yan Chihuo confused because he was surprised that he was in a disadvantageous position when his aura clashed with the Wind Edge Lord. It felt like he sank into a quagmire, and his blade aura was slowly being devoured.

But he didn’t panic. He had the title Flame Blade, and this was because of the ghost spirit martial technique that he practiced. It was the Heavenly Flame Blade, in which he had reached the manifestation stage in.

Apart from not grasping the Heavenly Dome Blade Intent, he had no weakness in the Dragon Pulse Realm. Not to mention that he even grasped nine different sacred flames. Empowered by the sacred flames, his dragon origin was more massive than others, and more violent at the same time.

Yan Chihuo took a step forth and drew out his blade. His blade ray was like a crimson sun. This blade was extraordinary. Just swinging it created a vortex filled with flames, and the entire Thunderblood Battlestage instantly became hot. It felt as though the air was melting, and the saint blood on the stage was starting to ignite.

The Wind Edge Lord was confident and threw a punch. When a violent gale swept out, it shattered the vortex of flames. Then, he merely used two fingers to clamp onto Yan Chihuo’s blade. This scene was practically the same as when he previously fought Shi Feng, domineering and arrogant.

“You’re courting death!” Yan Chihuo was completely enraged by this scene, and he withdrew his blade before unleashing a barrage of attacks.

But facing his attacks, the Wind Edge Lord revealed an indifferent smile, and a dragon roar echoed from his body. The next moment, dazzling silver radiance burst out from his body. When the silver dragon’s aura swept out, the pressure emitted by Yan Chihuo’s blade fell before the Wind Edge Lord threw out a punch to block the incoming attacks.

Ten-odd attacks later, an explosion resounded from the two, accompanied by flames that shot to the sky. This made Yan Chihuo’s face change a little. Pulling back his sword and retreating, Yan Chihuo said in a deep voice, “Everyone says that you’re ambitious, but it looks like everyone has underestimated you!”

The Wind Edge Lord’s calm response to his attacks made Yan Chihuo’s face become grave. Halos began to appear behind him, and each halo was a different saint flame. It didn’t take long for him to summon the nine sacred flames at the same time.

Yan Chuo thought that under such circumstances, the Wind Edge Lord would restrain himself. At the very least, his aura would be suppressed by him.

But in contrast to his expectation, the Wind Edge Lord laughed as a silver radiance bloomed from him before he dashed forth. There was a silver radiance on him that looked like a waterfall, and the ancient runes on his body looked like a layer of silver dragon scales.

Not only did that grant him a powerful defense, it would even empower his attacks with the dragon’s aura. As sparks flew around, the Wind Edge Lord dashed forth, allowing Yan Chihuo’s blade to land on him. He gave off a domineering arrogance, like a war god.

When Yan Chihuo’s saint blade landed on him, it merely left a few marks on his body. Not only did it fail to injure him, but he couldn’t even retreat.

“The Silver Dragon Saint Physique!” Yan Chihuo briefly furrowed his brows before he coldly said, “I don’t believe I can’t hack through your Silver Dragon Saint Physique!”

Ji Lingfeng sighed within his pavilion when he saw this scene. Among the seven divine dragons, the Silver Dragon had the strongest defense, not to mention the Wind Edge Lord had also grasped Thunderstorm Intent. The wind could defend him, and the lightning could counterattack.

So Yan Chihuo fell into the Wind Edge Lord’s trap, wanting to forcibly break through his defense. This was because his sacred flames were useless against the latter.

Beside him, Xiao Yuanqi shook his head, but he didn’t say a word. If Yan Chihuo focused on blade dao and not the number of sacred flames, he might still be able to put up a resistance. If he could fuse the nine sacred flames, he would still have a good chance of winning.

But because he easily defeated his opponents with the nine sacred flames and rarely had a rival amongst those of the same generation, he naturally loosened up and mistook that he had a powerful blade dao.

“Shattering Star!” A terrifying punch suddenly appeared, and Yan Chihuo was sent flying with one blow.

“What kind of fist technique is that? His style changed completely!” Yan Chihuo was shocked because the Wind Edge Lord should be proficient in Thunderstorm Intent. He gritted his teeth, and detonated the remaining sacred flames within his body, igniting his dragon origin.

“Heavenly Flame Skysplitting Slash!” Yan Chihuo’s saint blade suddenly became terrifying. This was a secret technique to ignite his dragon origin with sacred flames.

“Divine Dragon Overlord Fist!” The Wind Edge Lord roared. He didn’t take a single step back since the beginning of the fight. After he performed this fist technique, his attack became even more domineering. The silver radiance unleashed by him nearly tore through the sky, and his attack emitted a powerful aura.

As a ferocious roar echoed in the sky, the punch gave off a feeling that he could eradicate all lives, shattering Yan Chihuo’s blade ray and forcing him to take another step back. The blade ray shattered, and Yan Chihuo kept retreating.

Ten steps later, he finally couldn’t hold on any longer and the saint blade was knocked out of his hand.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“It looks like there’s nothing impressive about the holy lands’ geniuses after all.” The Wind Edge Lord stood with his hands behind him, looking elegant. Just like how he defeated Shi Feng earlier, he was still as arrogant as before, looking domineering.

When Yan Chihuo landed on the ground, blood dripped down his lips and the nine halos behind him were shattered. His face was terrifyingly pale.

“I lost.” Yan Chihuo said with reluctance. His face was ugly, as though he took a huge blow to his self-esteem. He was prideful and arrogant before he came here, not putting the Four Young Masters in his eyes. He only thought that Ji Lingfeng was capable of fighting him. He never expected he would lose to the Wind Edge Lord, and judging from the looks of it, he didn’t even use his full strength.

“Not bad. At least you can force me to use the Divine Dragon Overlord Fist, so you can be proud of that. After all, amongst all the Dragon Clan’s fist techniques, it is only second to the Imperial Dragon Fist and Sovereign Dragon Fist.” The Wind Edge Lord said proudly.

The Wind Edge Lord was arrogant. He might seem like he’s giving Yan Chihuo a step-down, but he was indirectly praising himself.

Yan Chihuo’s eyes were filled with humiliation, but there was nothing he could do about this situation. After all, it was a fact that he lost the battle. Thus, he went down the stage without saying a word.

“The Wind Edge Lord won so easily?!”

“Don’t tell me he’s going to challenge all the holy lands’ geniuses…”

“Judging from this situation, he will probably fight again. But I don’t know who he will choose to fight.”

“He’ll probably challenge Ji Lingfeng or Xiao Yuanqi. I wonder if he has the courage to challenge them or Yi Feng. After all, Yi Feng was pretty arrogant earlier.” The people at Thunderblood Square were excited.

The Wind Edge Lord won a victory for the Four Young Masters, and the atmosphere in the Martial Dao Tea Party was filled with suspense and excitement. Just when everyone was discussing amongst themselves, the Wind Edge Lord looked around before his gaze fell onto the pavilion that Lin Yun was in. With pride filling his face, he asked with a soft smile, “Champion of the Nirvana Banquet, I believe you have rested long enough. Are you interested in coming over and playing with me?”

An uproar broke out from the surrounding area because this was clearly unexpected. Yan Tie furrowed his brow, and said, “Wind Edge Lord, you can compete for the top three with your strength. So why waste time on Lin Xiao? You’ll only expose your trump cards.”

The Wind Edge Lord was briefly stunned before he smiled, “You’re overthinking it. I won’t waste much time. As for my trump cards? Not even Yan Chihuo can make me reveal them. So do you think Lin Xiao can? Moreover, the Martial Dao Tea Party is a place where everyone interacts in their martial dao. So I will pull my punches. Brother Lin is the strongest swordsman in the Dragon Pulse Ranking. If you don’t even have the courage to fight me, aren’t you a little too disappointing?”

Yan Tie and the other two swordsmen were furious when they heard what the Wind Edge Lord said. If Lin Yun refused to fight, the so-called “Strongest Swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking” would no longer be an honor but a joke.

In the future, whenever everyone mentioned the strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, they would call him a coward who didn’t even dare to fight the Wind Edge Lord.

Lin Yun raised his head and briefly glanced at him before saying, “Since you want to play, I’ll fulfill your wish, then.”
