Chapter 831 - Great Thundercloud Explosion

The sky slowly turned dark as the city and the lake lit up. The end of the day was nearing, which meant that the battles would end soon. However, the top ten had more or less been determined, save for a few spots.

The top ten were ranked based on their points and the champion would have the most points. Points were earned for each win. Additionally, the profound amber aura was used to make the ranking clearer. Yu Haotian, Zhao Wuji, Lin Yun, Zhu Qingshan, and Jiang Ziye were in the top five while Yue Weiwei, Mu Han, Bai Lixuan, and Wu Xiaotian were in the bottom five.

There was something very mysterious about Yue Weiwei though. Everyone could tell that her only concern was making it into the top ten and not her ranking. Since she didn’t really do much in the tournament, the only mystery left was to determine the order of the three kings. After all, neither Yu Haotian, Zhao Wuji, nor Lin Yun had suffered a defeat so far.

However, everyone was certain that Yu Haotian would be the champion, forcing Lin Yun and Zhao Wuji to fight for second place. If there was any suspense left in the tournament, it was between Lin Yun and Zhao Wuji.

As night enveloped the city, Zhu Qingshan jumped onto the stage to fight with Zhao Wuji. Everyone had seen Zhu Qingshan’s strength clearly because he even forced Yu Haotian to use the second punch. Furthermore, everyone knew that he still had another trump card. Technically, Zhu Qingshan still had a chance of becoming one of the three kings since he had one more surprise left.

“Shadow Ghost Slash!”

“Thundercloud Palm!” Zhu Qingshan and Zhao Wuji used their strongest attacks right off the bat. A huge explosion filled the stage as they ferociously attacked.

“Asura Ghoststep!” Like a demon, Zhu Qingshan executed a bizarre movement technique and the black miasma from his blade created a terrifying phenomenon. All of a sudden, ghosts howled all over the stage.

“Thunderburst! Torrential Cloud!” Zhao Wuji had no chance but to escape. He pushed his palm out and unleashed a dazzling explosion as clouds swept through the sky.

Zhu Qingshan gnashed his teeth and executed Soul Devour. The howling ghosts manifested from his saber intent drilled into Zhao Wuji’s body without anyone knowing.

“This move is useless against me. Time to end this game. Thundercloud Explosion!” Zhao Wuji pushed his palm out indifferently, refining all of the howling ghosts from Zhu Qingshan’s attack.

A huge explosion took place as lightning flickered in the sky where the clouds formed a huge vortex. The vortex swallowed up the lightning and the center turned into gold magma. From afar, it looked like the vortex contained a starry sky.

When the vortex descended, the immense pressure cracked the stage before heading towards Zhu Qingshan. With an explosion, Zhu Qingshan was covered in wounds.

“Sky Devour!” Zhu Qingshan roared with a pale face as his black miasma began to burn. In the blink of an eye, Zhu Qingshan’s blade became 300 meters long as it burned with black flames.

Soul Devour, Blood Devour, and Sky Devour. These were Zhu Qingshan’s strongest techniques and everything in the path of his blade would be incinerated.

“Great Thundercloud Explosion!” Zhao Wuji didn’t dare to look down on this attack as he pushed his palm to the sky. Dazzling lightning flickered on his body as nine lightning vortexes appeared in the sky. Each vortex had the same strength as his previous attack that sent Zhu Qingshan flying. With a wave of his hand, all nine vortexes merged into one purple vortex.

Bolts of lightning streaked across the sky and gave light to Zhao Wuji’s cold face. The vortex instantly destroyed Zhu Qingshan’s attack before it extinguished Zhu Qingshan’s blade aura. Zhu Qingshan threw up blood when his attack failed and then he went flying into the barrier. When he landed on the ground, he relied on his blad to hold himself up.

After a while, he spoke, “Your thundercloud intent is truly impressive. But you won’t be able to defeat me the next time we meet.”

“You think too much. You’re going to lose even more terribly the next time we meet.” Zhao Wuji snorted. With the outcome determined, he devoured half of Zhu Qingshan’s profound amber aura, which brought his dragon projection to five claws.

“Zhao Wuji is really strong. His trump card was incredible. If Yan Long’zi was still alive, he would have died a terrible death from that attack.”

“Zhu Qingshan is already strong enough not to die from Zhao Wuji’s attack.

“Now that three Five-Clawed Golden Dragons are born, I wonder which one will be devoured first.” With the birth of Zhao Wuji’s Five-Clawed Golden Dragon, the banquet’s atmosphere rose to a new height.

“Next battle, Lin Yun VS Yue Weiwei.” Not long after, it was Lin Yun’s turn to fight again. The crowd clamored because they had no idea what would happen. However, they had a feeling that the battle wouldn’t be intense since Yue Weiwei wasn’t concerned with her ranking, not to mention that she was facing Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was at a critical juncture in his refinement of the blood essence, but the lingering intent with them was hard to refine. It had brought him a bit of trouble, but he wasn’t bothered by it since it was a surprise gift. If he couldn’t refine it before the fight, he would just have to wait until after the banquet.

“Hehe. Big Brother Yun, you have to go easy against me.” Yue Weiwei winked before she placed her flute by her lips. This scene instantly surprised the crowd because Yue Weiwei only used her flute when she was serious. Otherwise, she would use her flute as a sword when fighting.

Ethereal music sounded out and a soundwave blew towards Lin Yun in the form of blades before he could even react. He instantly drew his sword and destroyed the incoming soundwaves. In the blink of an eye, countless soundwaves come flying towards him.

With no choice but to be serious, Lin Yun executed the Seven Profound Steps and his sword began to dance in his hand. Facing Yue Weiwei’s song, Lin Yun kept swinging his sword as sparks hit the stage.

Weird… Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling perplexed. The soundwave and sword intent contained in the music was similar to Yu Haotian’s Overlord Fist. It only took him a split second to figure out what was going on. Yue Weiwei was using her music to help him like she did in the past.

A few moments later, Lin Yun was shocked to discover his blood was boiling because the soundwave was slowly destroying the lingering intent in the flame dragon blood essence. The blood essence even released a painful howl that belonged to Yan Long’zi.

The intent had no intelligence as it merely contained Yan Long’zi’s violence and resentment. These were things that couldn’t be destroyed in a short amount of time. However, Yue Weiwei’s music was accomplishing the impossible as the flame dragon blood essence was smoothly refined by Lin Yun.

Half an hour later, Lin Yun had completely refined the blood essence and the Azure Dragon Mark on his chest turned red. His heart throbbed violently as he could sense the power coursing through his body. With the upgrade, the dragon runes manifested an ancient azure dragon that imprinted itself on Lin Yun’s body like a divine rune.

Then, the explosive aure dragon energy within his body slowly fused with his iris sword energy. Lin Yun brandished his sword and instantly shattered the incoming soundwaves.

Seeing this scene, Yue Weiwei put her flute down and smiled, “I give up.”

As Yue Weiwei left the stage, her face looked pale. The crowd was baffled by this because the only thing they saw was Lin Yun getting trapped in a soundwave. THey had no idea how Yue Weiwei lost. However, they recalled that Yue Weiwei did something similar when she fought Jiang Ziye.

After Lin Yun left the stage, he spread his hands apart and black flames burned on his palm with flickering lightning. Just as the flame was about to soar into the sky, Lin Yun suddenly clenched his fist and extinguished it.

The flame was the dragon's breath, more specifically the Azure Dragon’s breath. He had finally reached the nonaform of the Azure Dragon Enneaform.
