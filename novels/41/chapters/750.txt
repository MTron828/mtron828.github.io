Chapter 751 - Terranean Destruction

Lin Yun’s battlefield made many people turn pale. No one expected that the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape could still turn the tables around even after being heavily injured, not to mention that it even grew two black wings.

But even though the tides had changed, blood still flowed out of the wound on its chest. Everyone could tell that it wasn’t in its top state after receiving Qin Yang’s fatal attack.

“Damn it, the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s bloodline has actually mutated. We have to kill it quickly or it’ll make a breakthrough to the Heavenly Soul Realm…” Someone could see that the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s aura was rising, but it wasn’t in a good state.

If a top-tier genius was present, they might be able to kill the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape. However, none of them were present, so it would make a breakthrough as soon as it recovered from its injuries. It would become an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast if they didn’t stop it. This thought was terrifying to everyone present.

The Mountainshaking Demonic Ape took a deep breath while looking at Lin Yun. It started gathering demonic aura on its chest, preparing for its next attack. When it reached the pinnacle, it unleashed a booming roar that generated a terrifying soundwave. Immediately, the soundwave charged at Lin Yun.

By the time everyone heard the voice, the ground was already trembling violently and demonic beasts were exploding everywhere. The martial cultivators were lucky and were simply sent flying. Lin Yun had a keen sense, so he detected the shockwave beforehand and managed to escape. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

His speed was fast as he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra to create countless golden afterimages. But the black soundwave was even faster as it destroyed all of Lin Yun’s afterimages before slamming against him. Although it was residual power, it was enough to cause Lin Yun’s heart to throb violently and his bones to crack.

Blood dripped down from Lin Yun’s lips. When he turned back, there were less than a dozen people alive within a ten mile radius. The aftermath was hard to swallow since there were at least a thousand people on the battlefield just a moment ago. The only ones that were left were the monstrous geniuses, sect elders, and demonic cultivators. However, only Lin Yun had managed to stay upright.

“Damn it, this demonic ape is clearly a spent force.” Qin Yang tossed a pellet into his mouth with unwillingness in his eyes. His face was pale and he wasn’t able to stand up no matter how he tried. As for Long Hao, Ji Wuye, and the rest, half of their bones were broken. They couldn’t even stand, not to mention move right now. This made all of them fall into despair.

“We’re finished. Even Qin Yang can’t stand.”

“Holy shit, the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape is too powerful. It actually has such powerful vitality even after suffering such injuries.”

“No, there’s still someone standing.”

“That swordsman!” The experts on the city wall fell into despair until they discovered that there was still one figure who was still standing. No one could imagine that someone else could stand up when even Qin Yang couldn’t. This made everyone’s eyes light up as they instantly recognized that this swordsman was the one who killed ten quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm experts.

“I’m the only one left?” Lin Yun muttered to himself as he looked at the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape. He really felt fated with it.

After unleashing the soundwave, the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape seemed exhausted as it gasped for its breath and looked around coldly. But when it noticed that Lin Yun was still standing, its eyes surged with a terrifying killing aura.

Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slash!

Lin Yun flicked his wrist as eighteen thunderbolts lit up the sky. The power of the sword didn’t explode and instead merged with Lin Yun’s sword aura. This caused the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape to slow down as if it had fallen into a swamp. Just when its palm was about to reach Lin Yun, he gently jumped to dodge the attack. Then, with a flick of his finger, he destroyed the demonic ape’s attack.

Overlord Sword—Solar Slash!

As the Mountainshaking Demonic Beast charged at him once more, Lin Yun swung his sword. He was still merging his sword techniques with his sword aura, so the sword rays made a decent impact on the demonic ape. This enraged the demonic ape even more, so it unleashed another soundwave with its roar.

The might of the soundwave was a little weaker than before, but it was still lethal. Lin Yun’s sword aura began to tremble as it felt like it was about to collapse with blood appearing on his skin. He then circulated the Azure Dragon Enneaform and the Azure Dragon Mark on his chest lit up, which made his heart even more active.

Overlord Sword—Big Bang!

Clenching his teeth, Lin Yun swung another sword to stabilize his sword aura from collapsing. His fight with the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape was heaven-shaking and caused many terrifying shockwaves. But under Lin Yun’s bizarre sword technique, the demonic ape seemed to be getting weaker. More accurately speaking, it was becoming slower.

Lin Yun’s keen senses then picked up on the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s flaw and his eyes lit up brightly.

Overlord Sword—Breaking Dawn!

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun exploded his sword aura that had accumulated from the Overlord Sword. When he stabbed his sword out, it caused brilliant flames to soar into the sky as his overbearing aura began to surge ferociously.

The Mountainshaking Demonic Ape could only watch as this happened. It was already exhausted, so before it could recover, Lin Yun’s Flower Burial Sword had already stabbed it. When his sword stabbed the demonic ape, golden flames began to blaze on its body.

The phenomenon was even greater than the one caused by Qin Yang. In the next second, boundless intent began to pour into the demonic ape’s body. With a huge explosion, the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape was sent flying with a huge hole in its body.

But Lin Yun wasn’t as careless as Qin Yang. He charged forward and attacked once more, creating a brilliant dazzle. When the brilliance settled down, everyone saw the demonic ape being torn into pieces.

“This attack is becoming even smoother. I’ll call this form Terranean Destruction.” Lin Yun landed on the ground with exhaustion on his face, but the fire in his eyes didn’t decline a little. In an instant, he executed the Dustlight Sword Art in its entirety. From this, he was able to sense that there was more potential to excavate from the technique.

“Is it dead?” Everyone on the city wall was shocked that Lin Yun managed to kill the demonic ape that Qin Yang couldn’t.

“It’s that sword again…” Murong Qing was filled with lingering fear as he laid on the ground. He instantly recognized that the sword technique Lin Yun used to kill the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape was two times stronger than before. Did he hold back against me?

“You better not provoke him. He will definitely shine during the Draconic Banquet,” said Long Hao with a grave expression.

Even Ji Wuye wore an unsightly expression as he felt that his gamble with Lin Yun was simply a joke.

“I still made some improvements.” Lin Yun muttered to himself. Compared to a few days ago when he first fought the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape, he had grown stronger by at least twofold. He didn’t even need to bring his quasi-spiritual sword intent. He had to admit that this beast tide was an incredible opportunity for him.

If things were normal, there was no way his sword technique could make such improvements. He walked over slowly and retrieved the overlord beast core from the demonic ape. The beast core was shrouded in black lightning and emitted a violent aura.

When Lin Yun held onto it, it felt heavy. He didn’t know if it was because of the demonic ape’s death, but the beast tide started to retreat. This made all the cultivators on the battlefield feel relieved as they had never experienced such bitter slaughter before. Their hot blood had cooled down and they became overwhelmed by exhaustion. But there was no doubt that those who survived had become stronger.
