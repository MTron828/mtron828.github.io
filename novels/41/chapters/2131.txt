Chapter 2132 - Making A Move

As the True Dragon Secret Realm began to crumble like bubbles, Lin Yun finally made a breakthrough into the Quasi-Saint Realm. Once the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon reached the seventh stage, his nirvana aura transformed into azure saint aura, filling up his violet palace.

Very quickly, an azure lake appeared within his violet palace. The lake was clear, looking like the sky. The lake was made up of saint aura and was ten thousand feet in width. An ordinary Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase would be impressive if their saint aura could reach a thousand feet in width, but Lin Yun’s saint aura was ten thousand feet!

With a single thought, the entire lake blazed as the boundless mist began to course through Lin Yun’s body, filling him with violent energy. As he became enveloped in azure saint radiance, a saint aura that belonged to him began sweeping out.

The ground trembled as the surrounding mountains began to collapse. Lin Yun didn’t control it but fully released his aura, and the aftermath left him shocked. He was shocked by what he saw and exclaimed, “Holy shit! This is the power of a Quasi-Saint?!”

It was no wonder why he could barely face Quasi-Saints by releasing all his sword intent and empowering it with his Azure Dragon Sword Heart. He had undergone a drastic transformation by the saint aura and officially stepped onto the saint path. This also meant that his lifespan had increased by five hundred years.

In addition to all the treasures he previously consumed, such as the Dragon Blooded Fruit and Divine Blood Fruit, his lifespan could easily reach eight hundred years or even a thousand years!

Lin Yun took a breath to calm himself down. He could feel his body becoming lighter. When he looked at his skin, his Azure Dragon Divine Physique was still at the initial stage. But he could sense that his body had become younger, which was the benefit of extending his lifespan. His body would become young, and he wouldn’t have to worry about the age of his physique now if he used a time and space treasure to speed up his cultivation. The ageing of his physique was genuine, and no treasures could change it. But it was different now.

“I can cultivate in the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda after the Blue Dragon Record ends!” Lin Yun’s eyes shone with excitement.

“Stop smiling to yourself like an idiot. It’s time for us to leave now.” Lil’ Purple looked at the smiling Lin Yun. She couldn’t help wearing an amicable smile like a mother looking at his son growing up. Although Lin Yun had yet to grasp any saint dao, he didn’t have to worry about that with his talent. As long as he had the time to settle down, he could easily grasp the Sovereign Dao, Sword Dao.

“Yeah. It’s time to leave this place.” Lin Yun’s gaze became sharp as he looked more confident.

Before the True Dragon Secret Realm was about to collapse, Lin Yun crushed a Quasi-Saint beast core and the surrounding space began to distort. When he regained his footing, he was on the True Dragon Path. This was a dragon mountain. He was at the foot of the mountain, and there was already an intense battle breaking out on the mountain.

Various people gathered on the True Dragon Path, the most complicated of the nine dragon mountains. There were either geniuses on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking that could sweep through most cultivators, or there were ordinary geniuses. There were also some underdogs planning to shine brightly here.

Lin Yun swept his gaze and soon discovered Ye Ziling’s figure. Even on the True Dragon Path, there were only nine quotas but over ten thousand competitors. The Sword Sect’s disciples were gathered around Ye Ziling. They were at the foot of the mountain and hadn’t started climbing the mountain. Everyone looked depressed, and Ye Ziling was bearing great pressure as the leader.

She was the Divine Snow Dragon of the Sword Sect, but the Sword Sect’s foundation was weak here in comparison to holy lands’s geniuses. Since the Sword Sect devoted all its resources to her, Ye Ziling had already reached the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm, but she had yet to grasp any saint dao.

She could be proud of her strength at the Ancient Barren Domain, but she couldn’t even be ranked in the top ten in a holy land like the Heavenly Dao Sect. At best, she was only around the same level as Wang Yue.

Lin Yun said nothing as he walked to the Sword Sect’s party. Right then, Gongsun Yan fell from the Dragon’s Tail, throwing out a mouthful of blood and suffering heavy injuries. Seeing this, everyone else from the Sword Sect quickly stepped forth to help him up.

It didn’t take long for another figure to fall. It was Zhao Yan this time. They wanted to try climbing onto the Dragon’s Tail but failed. Zhao Yan’s face was pale as he said, “One doesn’t even have the qualification to step on the Dragon’s Tail without a cultivation at the Indigo Origin Phase. We might be able to try and compete if someone helps us because the other forces have someone grasping saint dao leading the party, one person protecting three.”

There was a huge difference between those who grasped and those who didn’t grasp the saint dao. The latter could only be considered a quota, while those who grasped saint dao could help his fellow disciples.

Gongsun Yan furiously hammered the ground, “If only Flower Burial was here, we wouldn’t be suffering this.”

Everyone else from the Sword Sect was quiet as they recalled what happened in the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

When Lin Yun heard them mentioning Flower Burial, he was moved and said, “You guys seem to have encountered some difficulties.”

“We wanted to help Ziling get a spot, but there are too many cultivators on the Dragon’s Tail. So we can’t gain a foothold at all,” Ye Ziyun said.

Lin Yun understood what she was trying to say. The other disciples of the Sword Sect didn’t care about their quota, but they wanted to put Ye Ziling on the Blue Dragon Record, opening a path for her so that she could fight for a spot. With Ye Ziling’s strength, it shouldn’t be an issue for her to achieve a spot in the Dragon’s Tail. But everyone underestimated the brutality of the competition. Many spots were empty, but no one dared to compete for them. The Quasi-Saints grasping greater dao were overbearing because they didn’t only seize a quota for themselves but also for their fellow disciples.

“This is allowed in the rules?” Lin Yun frowned.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“There wasn’t any prohibition. There was no need to prohibit it because the Saint Elder was probably concerned about those geniuses on the likes of Dragon’s Claw. She naturally wouldn’t focus on the Dragon’s Tail,” Ye Ziling said.

Lin Yun understood it now, and it made things easier.

“You guys seem to have run into trouble?” A burst of laughter resounded. It came from a delicate-looking woman with snow flowers blooming in her eyes like Ye Ziling. Her name was Ye Xin’er, and she was a direct descendant of the Radiant Snow Saint Clan. She was cultivating in the Northern Ridge’s holy land, the Snow Billow Sect. Beside her was a youth called Ye Xuan. Despite his young appearance, he had an unfathomable cultivation and had mastered saint dao.

Behind her were cultivators from the Snow Billow Sect, and they also had snow flowers blooming in their eyes, meaning they were also cultivators from the Ye Clan.

Lin Yun noticed that these people were looking at Ye Ziling and Ye Ziyun with malice and arrogance.

Ye Xin’er charmingly smiled, “Jian Jingtian’s daughter can’t even reach the Dragon’s Tail? Jian Jingtian shone brightly back then, but you can’t even obtain a spot on the Dragon’s Tail. I bet you’re regretting that you left the clan, right?”

The moment she said that, the atmosphere became weird. Everyone from the Ye Clan wore playful gazes.

Ye Ziyun was furious, wanting to step forth to confront Ye Xin’er, but Ye Ziling held her hand, stopping her from doing so.

Ye Xuan looked at Ye Ziyun, and smiled, “Cousin Ziyun, didn’t I tell you not to go to the Sword Sect back then? It’s just a declined sect, with no prospects, even if you became a saint disciple. Do you know what I mean now?”

Ye Xin’er smiled, “Why don’t the two of you come with us? We’re all descendants of the Radiant Snow Saint Clan, and it’ll be too embarrassing if you can’t even reach the Dragon’s Tail.”

They were domineering with mocking smiles, wanting to see Ye Ziling’s embarrassment. After all, Ye Ziling was the apple of the Radiant Snow Saint Clan back then, with many people overshadowed by her radiance. Not to mention that Ye Ziling had a father famous within the Eastern Desolation, drawing countless envy.

Right then, Lin Yun stepped forth and stood beside Ye Ziling. He looked at the Ye Clan’s party and said, “Thanks, but no thanks. Ye Ziling has decided to walk with me on the True Dragon Path.”

“Ye Qingtian?” Ye Xuan, Ye Xin’er, and those from the Ye Clan were shocked because they didn’t know when Ye Ziling got to know Ye Qingtian. They naturally heard of Ye Qingtian before, and he didn’t have a good reputation. Even so, he was a prodigy swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect.

The Snow Billow Sect was also a holy land but couldn’t be compared to the Heavenly Dao Sect. Then again, Ye Qingtian was only ranked at the bottom of the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking.

“You… really want to walk the True Dragon Path?” Ye Ziling asked. Others didn’t know, but Ye Ziling knew that Ye Qingtian was Flower Burial Lin Yun. With his strength, he could easily walk the Divine Dragon Path, obtaining the Dragon’s Claw position at the very least.

“Why not?” Lin Yun asked.

Ye Ziling’s heart trembled, and she struggled, “I refuse.”

“Your refusal is ineffective.” Lin Yun smiled as he grabbed Ye Ziling’s shoulder before they went up the mountain.

“That fellow is a lecher. He might have a huge fame, but it's just an illusion.”

“Ye Ziling is also blind and has fallen so far. We can just watch as they’re beaten back down.” Those from the Ye Clan were unhappy when they saw that the prodigy of the Heavenly Dao Sect was willing to climb the mountain with Ye Ziling.

The foot of the mountain was in chaos as ten-odd people charged at the Dragon’s Tail. When a cultivator at the Indigo Origin Phase saw Lin Yun and Ye Ziling coming over, he pushed his palm over. His indigo saint aura formed into a huge palm, leaving cracks in the surrounding space.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun’s face turned cold as he pushed his palm forth. He released a powerful force from his palm that shattered the indigo palm.

Ten-odd people were sent flying away when the indigo palm shattered, throwing out blood. This immediately cleared the path, and Lin Yun’s attack shocked many people.

“What a powerful attack. Who is he?”

“Sending ten-odd people flying away with a slap. Based on his strength, he can confront those on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking.”

Those from the Ye Clan were shocked when they saw this scene, including Ye Xuan.

“How is this possible?!” Ye Xin’er couldn’t accept this reality. She bit her lips and said, “If Ye Qingtian is a lecher, his attention should be on me. How am I not comparable to her?”

Lin Yun and Ye Ziling stepped on the Dragon’s Tail, which had turned into a battlefield.

“Junior Brother Lin, you don’t have to help me.” Ye Ziling turned to look at Lin Yun.

Seeing that Ye Ziling already recognized him, Lin Yun wasn’t surprised as he smiled, “As the saying goes, kindness should be repaid with kindness. You’re the first senior sister I've met ever since I came to the Kunlun Realm, not to mention Jian Jingtian is my Senior Brother. So there’s no reason for me to watch you being humiliated.”
