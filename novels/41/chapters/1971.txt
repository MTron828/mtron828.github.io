Chapter 1972 - Disbelief!

At the Heavenly Dao Sect’s Indigo Thunder Peak. Wang Yue, Chen Zhong, Ouyang He, and Yuan Chen, who had some relationship with Ye Qingtian, came to Indigo Thunder Peak.

“Ye Qingtian isn’t at Indigo Thunder Peak. So where did he go?” Wang Yue sighed. Chen Zhong, Ouyang He, and Yuan Chen were baffled. When Ye Qingtian didn’t come to the Solar Jade Palace, only a few believed that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint chased Ye Qingtian away. But it was close to half a month, and Ye Qingtian was still nowhere to be seen.

This naturally sparked a wildfire of rumors within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and there were many versions. But weirdly enough, Ye Qingtian seemed to have disappeared and couldn’t be found anywhere within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“He’s not at Indigo Thunder Peak; no one saw him leave the sect. So just where did he go?” Chen Zhong said, holding onto his chin. They didn’t have much of a relationship with Ye Qingtian; only Wang Yue had a deeper relationship with him. But they could be considered acquaintances, so they were pretty worried about his whereabouts, and it was a little severe if the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint chased him away.

“Half a month from now, the Divine Dao Pavilion’s Young Master Frostless will be here. If he doesn’t show up, the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden will be snatched away,” Wang Yue sighed.

Young Master Frostless was a descendant of a divine musical clan, an embodiment of elegance and wealth. He was proficient in music and practiced spiritual runes at the Divine Dao Pavilion. He saw Bai Shuying from a distance and fell in love with her. He could be considered one of Bai Shuying’s suitors, and there were rumors that the Bai Clan had intentions of matching them together.

After all, Young Master Frostless was a perfect match for Bai Shuying, regardless of his family or background. Most importantly, everyone within the Heavenly Dao Sect also knew that Bai Shuying was proficient in music and various musical instruments.

The six holy lands of the Eastern Desolation often interacted with each other, and there were rumors that this was why Young Master Frostless joined the Divine Dao Pavilion.

Thus, Wang Yue was anxiously looking for Ye Qingtian, but he couldn’t find him anywhere, nor did Ye Qingtian leave behind any news. Then again, why should he worry for Ye Qingtian if he wasn’t concerned? Wang Yue shook his head because Ye Qingtian was nowhere to be found.

“I heard that the Ye Clan’s ancestor is looking for him, and he gave Ye Qinghong orders to secretly look for him,” Yuan Chen whispered.

Ouyang He smiled, “Not only him. Bai Yizhou, Zhang Kui, and Xiao Jingyan are also looking for him.”

“Let’s go back to the Nether Orchid Courtyard. Let’s hope that nothing happens to him,” Wang Yue said.

Lin Yun, who was in the plaza before the Dustless Palace, had no idea that Wang Yue was looking for him. He dispersed the Myriad Astral Celestial Art, and the silver radiance around him turned into a silver bead. He sat down and began to digest the massive information within his mind.

He was digesting, not comprehending. This was because his mind was buzzing, and he couldn’t be bothered to do anything else with the sudden information stuffed into his mind.

Four hours later, when Lin Yun opened his eyes, he spread his arms apart and soared to the sky before brandishing his sword within the plaza. He was roughly practicing the scriptures that he had digested, but it was crude and couldn’t be considered cultivating.

When he was done, Lin Yun’s vitality surged within his body, and it felt satisfying. He sheathed his sword and smiled, “This is a really good sword technique. Let’s call it the Wither Sword Art for now.”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint didn’t tell him the name of this sword technique, and Lin Yun could only come up with a name himself. He tried it earlier, and this sword technique was much stronger than the thirteen swords of the Divine Firefly Sword.

But just when he wanted to return, he stopped and turned around with a hint of doubt within his pupils. The zither music was still playing, but it was already late at night.

But after a brief pondering, Lin Yun finally understood what was happening. The erhu played by Bai Shuying wasn’t smooth, and the intent was somewhat lacking. She could barely play the intent contained within the music, so she should be practicing. But the erhu wasn’t easy to play and had a high threshold, despite seeming easy.

He suddenly thought of something and said, “Lil’ Purple, I heard you mentioned the Celestial Pool is a forbidden ground?”

“Yeah.”

“It should be hard for others to enter, aside from Bai Shuying, right?”

“Yeah. Not many people go to the Celestial Pool aside from the designated dates,” Lil’ Purple said. She suddenly asked, “Lin Yun, don’t tell me you plan to go to the Celestial Pool now?”

Lin Yun didn’t reply, but it wasn’t a sudden idea. After all, Lil’ Purple urged him several times, and this was the perfect opportunity. He said, “Let’s go and take a look. If there’s something wrong with the situation, we can withdraw. Lead the way.”

Since it was confirmed that Bai Shuying wasn’t there, this was the perfect moment to visit the Celestial Pool and look for the Solar Lunar Divine Rune.

“Hehe. I’m already excited!” Lil’ Purple said in excitement.

On the contrary, Lin Yun was calmer in comparison because he already sensed that there was a mystery behind the Solar Lunar Divine Rune. Even if they managed to find it, it wouldn’t be so easy to take it away.

But he couldn’t be bothered about that for now and wanted to understand the situation first. He didn’t wish to see Lil’ Purple hurt again. Lil’ Purple might seem optimistic, but Lin Yun knew he owed her a lot.

After making preparations, Lin Yun flew towards the Celestial Pool at night. He had Lil’ Purple put a spiritual array on him, allowing him to perfectly meld with the darkness as long as he didn’t fight anyone. In addition to the Divine Tortoise Transformation, it was hard for anyone to detect his existence, aside from Saints.

The foot of the mountain was covered in blooming flowers, and Lil’ Purple exclaimed in shock, “So many guards…”

It was different from the last time she was here, and many disciples were patrolling at the foot of the mountain, including a Golden Guard. Saint disciples held the position of Golden Guards after reaching a hundred years old, and they all had their cultivation at the Quasi-Saint Realm.

“There wasn't a Quasi-Saint guarding here before.”

“The Nether Orchid Courtyard isn’t a garden. They will naturally strengthen their security after what you did,” Lin Yun said. “But this also means that there’s something weird here.”

“Do you want to wear the mask?” Lil’ Purple said, wanting to give Lin Yun the Silvermoon Mask.

Lin Yun briefly pondered, but then gave up on that idea. He might have a glimmer of hope if he didn’t wear the mask. At the very least, people within the Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t dare to take it too far because of the Dragon Origin Great Saint. They might not hold back if he wore the mask upon discovering him.

“Let’s go,” Lin Yun said as he shuttled through the guards.

None of the disciples responded, and only the Golden Guard gave a glance here. But after scanning with his Quasi-Saint’s aura, he closed his eyes because he couldn’t find anything.

Lin Yun couldn’t help praising Lil’ Purple’s spiritual array because a Quasi-Saint didn’t detect him. He calmed down and continued his journey, soon climbing the mountain, sneaking within the darkness.

“There’s a reaction!” Lil’ Purple formed a seal with the crimson and golden runes shining on her forehead.

Lin Yun quickened his speed before stopping fifteen minutes later. There was a group of deacons guarding outside the Celestial Pool, and there was a Golden Guard. This Golden Guard turned out to be an old acquaintance, Bai Xiao, whom Lin Yun met back at the Contribution Hall, and Lin Yun had a good impression of this person.

“That person from the Bai Clan is the one who exchanged the True Dragon Saint Liquid for you?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“That’s him.”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Hehe. Why don’t we kidnap him later and get even more True Dragon Saint Liquid from him? The quality of the True Dragon Saint Liquid he provided was pretty good,” Lil’ Purple muttered.

Lin Yun knew that this person wasn’t so simple and ignored Lil’ Purple. He was careful and even held his breath, circulating the Divine Tortoise Transformation to the limit. His blood flow stopped, and his body became bold.

But Bai Xiao seemed to have noticed something and appeared before Lin Yun with a frown on his brows.

Lin Yun was decisive, and didn’t just foolishly stand there. He spread his arms apart and silently retreated. After he retreated, he saw Bai Xiao waving his hand in Lin Yun’s previous position, making Lil’ Purple nervous.

“Elder Bai, what’s the problem?” Bai Xiao’s movements naturally attracted the attention of the other deacons.

“Nothing. It’s just a mosquito,” Bai Xiao smiled and opened his palm to reveal a mosquito. This instantly made the other deacons speechless. But they had to admit that guarding the Celestial Pool was monotonous, and they couldn’t enter it, since it was a forbidden ground. But, usually, no one could come to the Celestial Pool.

Lin Yun wasn’t willing to remain there and risk being found, so he quickly entered the Celestial Pool. Everything became easy after he entered the Celestial Pool. There wasn’t anyone in there, but the pool was filled with a dense saint aura. The entire pool was covered in a white fog made from saint radiance, making it even more mysterious.

“There’s no one here.” Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple let out a breath of relief.

So Lin Yun landed beside the Celestial Pool and was filled with emotions as he looked at the pool. After all, Ye Qingtian was expelled from the Heavenly Dao Sect because he peeked at Bai Shuying, thus indirectly causing his death. But he never expected that he would also come to the Celestial Pool.

“The Solar Lunar Divine Rune is at the bottom of the pool!” Lil’ Purple said in a certain tone.

Lin Yun’s face changed, and he began to hesitate to go in to look. But he didn’t notice that someone else was also there. This person wasn’t Bai Shuying but the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, Wang Muyan.

She had arrived long ago, and she was hiding behind a rock. Judging from her position, anyone could tell this wasn’t her first time here.

“Ye Qingtian is the best because he’s foolish enough to come to the Celestial Pool for me,” Wang Muyan said. “If he’s still around, I won’t need to come here myself.”

She came here several times in secret, but the guards became stricter, and she had already intended to leave. She wasn’t able to find anything in her previous attempts, and this was why she wanted to enter the pool to take a look and see if she could obtain a harvest. But she was cautious and didn’t even get close to the Celestial Pool.

“It looks like I have to talk with Ye Qingtian and try to bluff him to come here for me once…” Wang Muyan’s gaze flickered, but the Ye Qingtian that was here now wasn’t the one she knew, and he wasn’t that easy to fool. If she wasn’t careful, she would be dragged down as well.

Right then, a ripple spread out on the pool, and this surprised Wang Muyan. She had been watching over this place, and she didn’t see anyone come here. So how could anyone else be here? Was it Bai Shuying? But Wang Muyan soon shook the speculation from her mind because Bai Shuying wouldn’t be so sneaky.

“It looks like there’s a show to watch now.” Wang Muyan smiled, and her face became even more charming.

Lin Yun swam within the Celestial Pool and could sense the rising surrounding temperature. If Lin Yun didn’t possess two saint physiques, he wouldn’t be able to endure the high temperature.

After he swam ten-odd meters down, the pool water became heated, which surprised Lin Yun. After all, the Celestial Pool was too weird. “What’s going on?”

He had been to some spiritual pools, and most pools had a flame vein beneath them. But this was no flame vein because not even a Quasi-Saint could bear it. The surrounding pool water had become golden, which meant it wasn’t just a flame or spiritual vein beneath it.

Suddenly, Lin Yun’s vision opened upon seeing a seated figure. This person was naked and emitted a faint saint radiance. This immediately made Lin Yun’s eyes widen in disbelief, and he nearly exclaimed because it was Bai Shuying. But what was she doing here while practicing the erhu in her residence?

Why was she here the moment he left? This made the corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitch because he was too unfortunate. But before he could think more about it, Bai Shuying suddenly opened her eyes with a terrifying aura contained within her pupils.
