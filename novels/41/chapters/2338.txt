Chapter 2339 - HowIs That Possible?!

As blood dripped from the Flower Burial Sword, the blood contained powerful saint energy that produced a huge sound whenever it dropped.

The surroundings fell silent as everyone’s heart began pumping rapidly, and fear rose. They had no idea whose blood it was.

Ao Jue and Mu Xiuhan wore grave expressions because they weren’t too sure either, and that blood seemed to be the heart’s blood. After stabbing through the heart, one would be heavily injured even if they weren’t dead.

Just when everyone was feeling anxious, Wang Jue threw out a mouthful of blood as he looked at Lin Yun in disbelief before falling to his knees, clutching his chest. Blood was pouring from his chest as he coughed, and the aura he gave off also began to decline.

“What a pity…” Lin Yun looked helpless. It was a pity that he wasn’t able to kill Wang Jue in the previous strike. When his sword came in contact with Wang Jue’s heart, he suddenly felt an ancient aura obstructing him that sent his nirvana back, forcibly interrupting his sword.

This is the power of a deity? Lin Yun felt that if he forcibly stabbed his sword into Wang Jue's heart, he would be heavily injured. This was a blessing given to Wang Jue by a deity that would activate if he was in danger.

“Young Master!” Ghost Owl and Ray Serpent quickly returned to Wang Jue’s side and helped him up. Right then, Ji Zixi, Xiong Tiannan, and Lin Jiangxian gathered over. They stood around Lin Yun, looking at the injured Wang Jue with a grave expression.

“Flower Burial? We’ll meet again on the saint mountain!” Wang Jue looked at Lin Yun with resentment and reluctance.

Lin Yun merely shrugged and said nothing.

“You as well, Xiong Tiannan!” Wang Jue turned to viciously look at Xiong Tiannan.

Xiong Tiannan awkwardly smiled, “Why vent your anger on me when I’m not the one making you kneel?”

“You better not be on the saint mountain, or I won’t let you go!” Wang Jue said coldly.

Lin Yun raised his brow, and said, “I return the same words to you. The deity won’t be able to protect you for the rest of your life, and you know that you should’ve died earlier.”

“Let’s go!” Wang Jue said with his face changing. He didn’t dare to stay here for another second and quickly left with the two remaining Azure Divine Guards, not daring to stay for another moment.

As for the other cultivators in the surrounding area, they were dumbfounded because they couldn’t see what sword technique Lin Yun had used earlier, and even a divine disciple went down on his knees.

“I’m afraid Flower Burial’s name will spread throughout the Heavenly Barren Realm after today…”

“Flower Burial?”

“I haven’t heard of him before. I heard from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion that he’s from the Kunlun Realm.”

Seeing Wang Jue leaving, everyone heaved a sigh in relief and quickly left. Their harvests were nothing compared to Lin Yun's, but they were considered decent, and they should refine them quickly. Amongst everyone, only Mu Xiuhan looked depressed. After all, his Silver Dao Fruits were taken by Wang Jue. This meant that he had no harvest here. He looked at Lin Yun with a reluctant look on his face before it changed.

“Let’s go. I can give you a dao fruit, so don’t think of anything else.” Ao Jue saw how pitiful he was and warned him not to go after Lin Yun’s Golden Dao Fruits.

“I’m not that foolish,” Mu Xiuhan said and left with those from the Golden Jade Pavilion. With that, Qilin Mountain became quiet. Only the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples remained.

“Big Brother Lin, you’re going to let him go just like that?” Ji Zixi asked. She was talking about Wang Jue. It made no sense for Lin Yun to spare him.

Lin Jiangxian explained, “He has the protection of a deity, and the seal left behind by that deity will be activated if his life is in danger. Wang Jue can’t activate it himself, but anyone who wants to kill him will suffer a backlash.”

“How is this fair? Isn’t this the training ground of the Heavenly Barren Ancestral God?” Ji Zixi asked.

“This is fair, but it’s more fair for some. You can see that Wang Jue was after me and not Chief Lin. I’m guessing that she also has a deity seal. After all, there are rumors that she can become a divine disciple anytime she wants,” Xiong Tiannan smiled.

Lin Jiangxian said nothing, neither denying nor acknowledging it.

Lin Yun looked at Lin Jiangxian, and smiled, “You’ve hidden yourself really deeply to even step into the threshold of the Five Elements Dao.”

Looking at Lin Yun, Lin Jiangxian smiled, “It’s nothing compared to you. You’re the one hidden the deepest. I was still planning to protect you.”

“No matter what, you have protected me and Zixi,” Lin Yun smiled.

“What are your plans?” Lin Jiangxian asked. When she asked that question, Xiong Tiannan also looked over with anticipation in his eyes.

“Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain. Do the two of you want to come along?” Lin Yun invited.

“Hahaha! Of course!” Xiong Tiannan laughed.

Lin Jiangxian smiled, “My pleasure.”

“What about them?” Lin Yun turned to look at the other disciples of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion.

“The journey to Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain will be dangerous, and it’s hard to reach without protection. Even if they did manage to reach there, they won’t possess the qualifications to climb the mountain,” Lin Jiangxian said. In the past, most cultivators from the Azure Cloud Realm couldn’t leave this region, so the Sovereign Monument was their greatest opportunity here.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lin Yun understood what Lin Jiangxian meant. They needed protection to reach Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain, so the decision laid with Lin Yun.

“Wu Yuhua, you want to come along?” Lin Yun looked at Wu Yuhua. He felt that this person was pretty good, not to mention that Wu Yuhua had helped him.

The other disciples of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion exclaimed in surprise. After all, the journey would be safe with Lin Yun protecting them, and their harvest would be unimaginable if they ran into any treasures.

Wu Yuhua rejoiced, but he replied, “I’ll not be coming. The chief is right; I can only go and watch with my strength.”

Lin Yun merely smiled, but didn’t force it.

“Big Brother Lin, why don’t you bring me along?” Xi Ruo stepped out from the crowd, looking at Lin Yun with a pitiful expression. This left Chang Jun completely dumbfounded. After all, didn’t Xi Ruo detested Lin Yun? His expression became strange since he had considered Xi Ruo to be his dao companion, even if the latter never acknowledged it. He never expected that Xi Ruo would turn to another man one day.

The faces of everyone from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion became strange, but they soon calmed down. After all, Xi Ruo even said Lin Yun wanted to get close to her earlier, and who wouldn’t want to go to Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain?

Wu Yuhua wore a playful expression and wasn’t surprised that Xi Ruo would say that. When he looked at Chang Jun, he inwardly rejoiced.

Lin Yun couldn’t make things sour with Lin Jiangxian around, so he could only find an excuse to reject her.

“Big Brother, let me come along. I can…” Xi Ruo wanted to say she could become his companion, but seeing Ji Zixi, she changed her tone, “I can become the maid of you and Lady Zixi.”

Chang Jun’s face became dark when he heard that, while Ji Zixi smiled, “Well, that’s not entirely impossible. Big Brother Lin, you should need a maid, right?”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled because Ji Zixi was too much.

“Xi Ruo, don’t force it since Young Master Lin isn’t willing. Furthermore, you and Chang Jun wanted to force Lin Yun to leave not too long ago,” Lin Jiangxian said coldly.

“Chang Jun and Wu Yuhua, you two look after everyone else,” Lin Jiangxian said before taking out three dao fruits and giving one to each of them. After she was done, the disciples of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion left.

“It’s not entirely bad with a maid around…” Xiong Tiannan scratched his head. But when he finished speaking, Ji Zixi and Lin Jiangxian turned to look at him, frightening him so much that he shut his mouth. He changed the topic, “I’m just talking. Brother Lin, we should get going as well.”

“There’s no need to hurry,” Lin Yun smiled as he shut his eyes. A brief moment later, nine golden streaks descended. They were the nine Golden Dao Fruits Lin Yun had thrown out earlier.

Xiong Tiannan exclaimed, “You really threw them out?”

“I left my sword intent on them, so they’re still under my control,” Lin Yun smiled. He removed four Golden Dao Fruits, giving Lin Jiangxian and Xiong Tiannan two each. He said with sincerity, “This is a small gratitude for guarding me earlier.”

Xiong Tiannan’s heart began to pump since he never imagined Lin Yun would give away the Golden Dao Fruits just like that.

Lin Jiangxian hesitated, “Actually, you could’ve left. The reason why you stayed behind and made a breakthrough is because you’re worried about us.”

“What are friends for?” Lin Yun smiled.

Lin Jiangxian looked at the Golden Dao Fruits and said, “The Golden Dao Fruits are Sovereign Dao Fruits. It can allow someone to comprehend a Sovereign Dao, and the value is unimaginable. So you better keep it for yourself.”

Xiong Tiannan also calmed down, saying, “Just one will do. Brother Lin, your saint dao is too little, and this is why you suffered a loss in your fight with Wang Jue.”

Lin Jiangxian nodded upon hearing that. The Golden Dao Fruit was tempting, but taking two was too much.

Lin Yun bitterly smiled, “Truth be told, I also have a crimson dao fruit, the Eternal Dao Fruit, aside from the Golden Dao Fruits…”

The moment he said that, Xiong Tiannan was dumbfounded. Even Lin Jiangxian stared at Lin Yun with disbelief. She exclaimed, “How… is that possible?!”
