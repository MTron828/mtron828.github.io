Chapter 1915 - Serenity

Lin Yun stopped after he completely ruined the Heavenly Cloud Fruit with his feet. The surroundings had fallen into a dead silence. Everyone was dumbfounded because it was a three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit that Lin Yun destroyed, not to mention it was a resounding slap to Ye Feifan’s face. This was simply too ruthless!

Ye Feifan had probably never suffered such humiliation before. Even Chen Jun, who was beside Ye Feifan, was dumbfounded but didn’t dare to say a word.

Chen Feng was terrified by this scene, and he covered his mouth. He knew how Ye Feifan bullied Ye Qingtian in the past, and Ye Qingtian had to wear a fawning smile even after he was bullied. He knew that Ye Qingtian had no status within the Ye Clan, and even an inner disciple within the Heavenly Dao Sect could order him around. But he had never imagined this scene before.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re courting death!” Ye Feifan lost control of his temper. They were both saint’s disciples, but there was a vast difference between them because his master was only an ordinary Saint, while Ye Qingtian’s master was a Great Saint. If he wanted to hold his ground in front of Ye Qingtian, his master had to be a Saint Sovereign, at the very least. But there was a limit to his tolerance, and he finally lost it now.

“I can’t believe that the Dragon Origin Great Saint took someone as shameless as you as his disciple. So what if you’re the senior brother? Even if you’re the senior brother, that doesn’t mean you can humiliate your junior brother!” Ye Feifan said coldly. “Even if the Great Saint punishes me and even if my master doesn’t allow me to, I’ll have to teach you a lesson no matter what!”

Flames blazed within his heart, and he couldn’t be bothered too much.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun looked at Ye Feifan with disdain, before he took out the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s medal and shoved it in Ye Feifan’s face. When a Great Saint’s aura spread out from the medal, Ye Feifan felt as though he had seen the Dragon Origin Great Saint, and his pupils were filled with fear. His fury disappeared, and he immediately came to his senses.

“Don’t cower. If you dare to move, the Dragon Origin Great Saint will know. If you have the guts, teach me a lesson in front of the Dragon Origin Great Saint and repeat what you said earlier,” Lin Yun snickered, watching as Ye Feifan backed off.

Ye Feifan’s face became ashen, and he naturally wouldn’t dare to teach Ye Qingtian a lesson in front of the Dragon Origin Great Saint, even if he had a hundred guts. He now came to his senses and remembered that Ye Qingtian was no longer the same person he was before; he was now the direct disciple of a Great Saint!

“Senior Brother, I’m sorry,” Ye Feifan apologized, cupping his hands together. “Please forgive me.”

“You want me to stop? Weren’t you cocky earlier and wanted to teach me a lesson?” Lin Yun sneered, quickly exposing Ye Feifan.

“You want me to stop here? Sure, lick all the Heavenly Cloud Fruit on the ground,” Lin Yun said.

The moment Lin Yun said that, the faces of everyone from the Dao Yang Palace changed, and Ye Feifan was also dumbfounded. They didn’t expect that Ye Qingtian would take it so far.

“I’m just joking. Brother, don’t tell me that you can’t take a joke?” Lin Yun smiled and adjusted Ye Feifan’s collar. He continued, “You’re a fellow clansman of mine, and who in the Heavenly Dao Sect doesn’t know that my brother, Ye Feifan, is a gentleman? You’ve never been polite with your fellow clansman, often teaching them lessons and hoping they could perform well. I have changed and am now a Great Saint's direct disciple. So you don’t have to teach me a lesson anymore in the future!”

As Lin Yun spoke, he gave Ye Feifan two gentle slaps on his face before leaving as he laughed. His cockiness left everyone dumbfounded because Ye Qingtian had given them a whole new impression of him, and they couldn’t imagine that someone could be so cocky.

“Ye Qingtian, since you’re the direct disciple of a Great Saint, do you dare to participate in the Di Ranking Battle seven days from now? Let us have some fun!” Ye Feifan turned around and looked at Lin Yun’s silhouette.

“Don’t worry about it. I’ve already decided to participate in the Di Ranking Battle. Do you want to take revenge? I’ll give you this opportunity!” Lin Yun smiled and left.

Chen Feng took several peeks at Ye Feifan before he quickly caught up with Ye Qingtian. He was so nervous that his heart nearly flew out of his chest.

“The Di Group?”

“Is Ye Qingtian insane? The limit of the Di Group is the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. He’s only at the Profound Death Stage, so how will he fight?”

“No one will care that he’s the direct disciple of a Great Saint on the stage.”

“He’s just boasting. I don’t believe he really dares to pick the Di Group.” Everyone was shocked, and no one believed that Ye Qingtian would dare to pick the Di Group.

Right then, a figure slowly appeared. He was Chen Zhong of the Nether Orchid Courtyard. Chen Zhong witnessed what happened earlier and smiled, “He wants to pick the Di Group? This is interesting…”

“We’ll see, then!” Ye Feifan gritted his teeth and turned around to leave. He was fuming with anger and had no place to vent it all out. He didn’t want to lose control of his temper before the crowd.

After Lin Yun returned to his Indigo Thunder Peak courtyard, he entered the Iris Secret Realm. After witnessing everyone’s strength on the Celestial Purging Mountain, he realized that he significantly differed from them, especially the two holy maidens, because they couldn’t be underestimated.

If he took part in the Di Group, it would be hard to make it into the top three if he didn’t reveal his trump cards. So he needed to make a breakthrough in his cultivation and sword intent.

When he returned to the Iris Secret Realm, Lin Yun saw Lil’ Purple guiding Lil’ Red in cultivating. Lil’ Red was currently practicing a palm technique, and it could create a violent gale whenever it pushed its palm forth. Even Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling breath-taken because the fighting prowess of Lil’ Red’s cat form wasn’t at all weaker than its dracoape form.

It was agile and could attack with its claws or dagger. Furthermore, it was so fast that Lin Yun couldn’t catch up with its speed. After refining half a cup of Demigod Wine, Lil’ Red’s cultivation reached the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and it could easily defeat Lin Yun now. If it took on the dracoape form, it could even clash with Quasi-Saints with its defenses.

Lin Yun was initially hurrying to cultivate, but he calmed down after seeing Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red. He approached Lil’ Purple and said, “So… Lil’ Red has already become so strong?”

“Of course, you have to see who’s guiding it. If you take me as your master or become my Divine General, I can easily help you take down all the holy maidens within the Heavenly Dao Sect and make them your maids,” Lil’ Purple smiled. “Just imagine how awe-inspiring it will be when the holy maidens become your maids!”

“For what? Washing your feet?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph. It’s their honor to wash the feet of a phoenix. I’m not like you!” Lil’ Purple snorted.

“Your hair is messed up,” Lin Yun said.

“What?! Quick, help me comb it nicely. My hairstyle can’t be a mess,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Come here. As usual?” Lin Yun asked.

“Yeah.”

Lin Yun smiled and brought her to the Phoenix Tree. Before he left, he gave Lil’ Red five four-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits. He sat beneath the Phoenix Tree with Lil’ Purple and smiled before combing her hair for her. Whenever he combed her hair, he couldn’t help laughing and soon thought of how Ye Ziling would put on makeup for her to make her look ugly. That was probably Lil’ Purple’s greatest shame, and he remembered how she cried when she returned.

Lil’ Purple became quiet before Lin Yun, like an ordinary little girl. Lin Yun didn’t know that it was natural at this moment, and his attitude had changed compared to when he climbed the Celestial Purging Mountain. His cockiness was only a disguise, and this was his real personality.

Under the Phoenix Tree, Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple looked serene and beautiful together.

“Lin Yun, I failed to find the Solar Lunar Divine Rune in the Nether Orchid Courtyard. This is weird…”

“It’s expected that you can’t find it. What’s weird about it?” Lin Yun said as he caressed Lil’ Purple’s hair.

“That’s not it!” Lil’ Purple was emotional and wanted to stand up.

“Sit still.” Lin Yun caressed Lil’ Purple’s hair.

“I can sense that the Solar Lunar Divine Rune’s aura is a lot weaker this time and practically non-existent. It’s no different from what I previously felt, and I couldn’t be sure that the Solar Lunar Divine Rune is in the Nether Orchid Courtyard if I didn’t visit that place before.”

“No need to hurry.”

“Hmph, you scumbag. You don’t care about it at all. When are you going to the Nether Orchid Courtyard again?”

“This… Bai Shuying will kill me if I go to the Nether Orchid Courtyard again…”

“Hmph. You scumbag. You don’t care about my matters and only remember Bai Shuying. You have to help me! After I restore my strength, I’ll catch her and have her be your maid.”

“You really dare say that.” Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling and snorted, “Empress, what happens if heaven collapses one day?”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“That will be a disaster…” Lil’ Purple sighed. “If heaven collapses, the Divine Dragon Era will be gone, and everyone in the Kunlun Realm will become livestock, enslaved for eternity even if they reincarnated. Why are you asking me about this?”

“Nothing much. I’m done with your hair,” Lin Yun said.

“Mirror! Where’s the mirror!” Lil’ Purple looked at her braids in the mirror before nodding in satisfaction.

“Hmph. You’re not allowed to come after me!” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun and snorted before she ran away.

Under the Phoenix Tree, Lin Yun took out the Heavenly Cloud Fruit and smiled. He was full of harvests from this trip to the Celestial Purging Tree. Although he hadn’t grasped the Astral Sword Intent, he made a lot of improvements in his sword dao.

But his smile disappeared when he wanted to cultivate, and remembered what the Sword Saint said in the wooden house.

“Ye Qingtian, if heaven collapses one day and the darkness returns, remember not to give up hope as long as you still have the sword in your hand. Since ancient times, the Heavenly Dao Sect’s duty has been to protect the heavens of the Kunlun Realm…”

Lin Yun opened his hand and took out a sealed purple crystal. Flames were blazing within the crystal, beating like a heart and containing boundless sword intent. This was a Sword Heart, the heart of a Sword Saint!
