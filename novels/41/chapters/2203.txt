Chapter 2204: Emperor Sword Array

“Where’s the Solar Divine Rune?” Gu Xinyu asked with shock. The restriction at the bottom of the Celestial Pool was ancient, and even the Holy Spirit Son had to spend some time to break it perfectly.

Everyone’s faces were ugly because the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan plotted for a few hundred years. The best outcome was to push the Wang Clan out as the ruler of the Heavenly Dao Sect. But they didn’t achieve that and only pushed the Ye Clan out as a puppet. Even if the mission failed with everyone dead, they had to retrieve the Solar Lunar Divine Rune no matter what.

Without the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, they couldn’t undo the seal on the God Burial Mountain Range that was left behind by the Southern Emperor. That meant the Demonspirit Clan and Blood Moon Sect wouldn’t be able to break free from the seal.

Zhao Tianyu and the Holy Spirit Son turned to look at Wang Muyan.

Wang Muyan briefly pondered, before she said, “Bai Shuying.”

“Bai Shuying?” Zhao Tianyu and the Holy Spirit Clan were baffled.

Wang Muyan explained, “The Solar Divine Rune must be within Bai Shuying’s body. I always wondered why she cultivated within the Celestial Pool, but it all makes sense now. The Solar Lunar Divine Rune has been separated into two, one part is in her body and the other is in the Celestial Pool. As her cultivation increases, the Solar Lunar Divine Rune will ultimately fuse within her body. I initially speculated that the Solar Lunar Divine Rune was within her body, but my speculation wasn’t exactly wrong.”

The Holy Spirit Son looked at Zhao Tianyu, and said, “The Divine Maiden should be right. We have to find Bai Shuying now.”

“Let’s join up with the sect master, first,” Zhao Tianyu said with a change on his face.

As they stowed the Lunar Divine Rune, Zhao Tianyu turned to Wang Muyan, and said, “Muyan, you can’t hold back anymore. Many things in the world are determined not to have an outcome, and some people are destined to not be friends. You know the consequences if we can’t obtain the complete Solar Lunar Divine Rune.”

Wang Muyan was briefly stunned, but she said nothing. But Zhao Tianyu knew that Wang Muyan already had an answer in her heart.

As the four left the Celestial Pool, they executed their movement techniques to the ruins of the Nether Orchid Courtyard. When they arrived, the Holy Spirit Son widened his mouth with disbelief.

But Zhao Tianyu was calm as he muttered, “It’s the Undying Phoenix Scripture. The sect master is fine, but I wonder who injured the sect master so badly.”

He might seem somewhat calm, but he was deeply shocked in his heart. This was because once the Undying Phoenix Scripture was achieved, the cultivator’s lifespan would become as terrifying as a phoenix. Upon reaching a high level, one could even rebirth through flames like the phoenix, instantly recovering from injuries.

But Zhao Tianyu knew, as someone who had cultivated the Undying Phoenix Scripture, that no one would do that unless they were forced into a dead-end. The rebirth was dangerous, and one wouldn’t be able to execute it again for a long time after that. A person only had nine rebirths in their lifetime, and it was unbelievable that the sect master would use a rebirth on a clone.

An hour later, the flames ended and a red-clothed youth reappeared with his emperor aura spread out.

Everyone quickly bowed, including the Holy Spirit Son, “Sect Master.”

The red-clothed youth looked at everyone and indifferently asked, “Have you guys retrieved the Sovereign Divine Rune?”

This immediately placed Zhao Tianyu’s group under great pressure, and they became nervous. In the end, Zhao Tianyu bore the pressure and explained what happened in the Celestial Pool. At the same time, he handed over the Lunar Divine Rune that was sealed in a golden jade slip.

As the red-clothed youth took the golden jade slip, he closed his eyes and sank his consciousness into it, where he saw a bright sun in his mind. The bright sun was in the Heavenly Dao Sect, and the red-clothed youth opened his eyes to look in a direction. He said, “The Divine Maiden is right; the Solar Divine Rune is in that lass.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The Holy Spirit Son frowned, “But over there is the altar. They might activate the Emperor Sword Array.”

“Can the Emperor Sword Array be activated without the Emperor Sword?” Zhao Tianyu asked.

“If the Emperor Sword is around, the array can slay emperors. But even without the Emperor Sword, the array's power cannot be underestimated,” the Holy Spirit Son said.

“We’ll just have to forcibly break it,” the red-clothed youth said in a domineering tone as he headed to the altar.

The Ye Clan also headed over to the altar under the lead of Stun Yang Saint Sovereign. They already didn’t have a path of retreat, so they could only walk to the end.

Zhao Tianyu couldn’t hold himself back along the way, and asked why the sect master executed the rebirth secret technique. The red-clothed youth casually replied that Ye Guhan’s Myriad Swords Unite injured him. He had initially recovered most of his injuries after devouring a Saint, but Ye Guhan endured his injuries and attacked him again, forcing him to undergo a rebirth.

“But even if he’s not dead, he won’t be able to pose any more threats. There’s no need to worry about him. Don’t belittle the disciples of the Radiant Sword Saint.” The red-clothed youth calmly explained, leaving Zhao Tianyu in shock.

“Before I was born, my master separated the Solar Lunar Divine Rune into two and injected the Solar Divine Rune into me, leaving the Lunar Divine Rune outside,” Bai Shuying explained. “My master planned for me to take the Lunar Divine Rune into my body after reaching the Saint Realm and fuse it with the Solar Divine Rune.”

Lil’ Purple widened her mouth and said, “No wonder the presence of the Solar Lunar Divine Rune kept disappearing.”

She finally understood it all now. When Bai Shuying was cultivating within the Celestial Pool, the Solar Lunar Divine Rune could be sensed. But when Bai Shuying wasn’t around, the Solar Divine Rune and Lunar Divine Rune couldn’t be sensed, and she could only sense some remnant aura at the most. This question had troubled her for a long time. She asked, “Why did your master want to inject the Solar Divine Rune into your body? I believe it doesn’t feel good…”

“Master didn’t tell me why; she only said that it has something to do with my birth. So the two of you are really here for the Solar Lunar Divine Rune?” Bai Shuying asked after shaking her head, looking at Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple.

Lil’ Purple glanced at Lin Yun, and said, “Scumbag, shouldn’t it be time for you to speak about your secret?”

Bai Shuying’s heart skipped a beat as she looked at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze.

“My secret?” Lin Yun took a deep breath, but Ye Guhan descended from the sky just when he was about to speak.

Ye Guhan clutched his chest since his injuries had worsened. He said, “Hurry up to the altar.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun and Bai Shuying supported Ye Guhan as they rushed to the altar. It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the altar, and all the ceremonial items were still around. The Bai Clan and Golden Guards were already gathered at the plaza.

Right then, a sword ray tore apart the horizon in the Dao Yang Palace’s direction as four figures dashed over, heading over to the plaza.

“It’s the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint!” An uproar exploded as the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, Dragon Origin Great saint, Serene Dust Great Saint, and Thousand Plume Great Saint arrived with many Saints behind them. But all of them were injured.

After taking a few breaths, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint descended with everyone and saw Ye Guhan’s party.

“Why are you guys in this condition?” The Thousand Plume Great Saint asked with a pale complexion.

“We ran into the Blood Moon Sect’s sect master, and I destroyed him once. But he has the Undying Phoenix Scripture, and he should be able to recover in an hour,” Ye Guhan smiled bitterly. He asked, “What about you guys?”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint threw out a mouthful of blood, and muttered, “The Gale Rein Great Saint colluded with the Demonspirit Clan, and they have a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit who’s at the pinnacle of the Great Saint. We’re fortunate that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint managed to injure him, or we wouldn’t have been able to escape. But it shouldn’t take long for that Demonspirit to recover.”

The Bai and Zhang Clan’s faces changed, and they became desperate when they heard that. Of all the Great Saints in the Heavenly Dao Sect, everyone had lost their ability to fight aside from the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and the remaining Saints were injured. If their enemies all come at once, the consequences might become terrible.

“Thousand Plume Great Saint, let’s activate the Emperor Sword Array. As long as the array doesn't break, the Divine Dragon Empire won’t stand and watch when daybreak comes. I have already informed the Divine Dragon Empire of our situation.” The Zhang Clan’s ancestor stepped out, looking at the Thousand Plume Great Saint. The Zhang Clan had an inexplicable relationship with the Divine Dragon Empire. If it was during a normal situation, the Thousand Plume Great Saint naturally wouldn’t be happy about it, but there was nothing he could say now.

“The Sacred Alliance has also been informed, and reinforcements will come at daybreak,” the Bai Clan’s ancestor said. He looked at the Thousand Plume Great Saint with mistrust, and said, “Thousand Plume Great Saint, activate the Emperor Sword Array quickly.”

His tone might sound warm, but he gave a feeling that he was forcing the Thousand Plume Great Saint.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint said in a self-mocking tone, “So the Heavenly Dao Sect has fallen so low.”

“We can’t delay any further. We have to activate the Emperor Sword Array quickly,” the Zhang Clan’s ancestor said.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint opened her eyes and said, “The Thousand Plume Great Saint is injured, so I’ll activate the Emperor Sword Array. This is a crisis for the Heavenly Dao Sect, so we must join forces together if we want to survive this ordeal.”

When she said that, she drew her sword and cut her left palm. As her blood fell onto the ground, the array around the altar began to shine brightly as it became activated.

Lin Yun noticed that the blood of demonic beasts activated this array during the day, but it had to be activated with a Great Saint’s blood now.

“Everyone, help me.” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint soared to the sky, and all the Saints present no longer hesitated. They cut their right palms and dripped their blood onto the ground.

As the activation speed of the array increased, runes began to spread out at a rapid speed. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint put her hands together in the air as she released a dazzling sword ray. She gave off a feeling that she was a sword. When she released her saint aura, a golden radiance also shone on the altar with a powerful sword aura that descended onto the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint as though it had traveled through time and space. Meanwhile, an Emperor Sword appeared that enveloped everyone in it.

Streaks of light ripped through the horizon as the red-clothed youth, Golden-Eyed Demonspirit, the Wang Clan, and the Ye Clan had arrived.
