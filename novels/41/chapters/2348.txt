Chapter 2349 - Sword In Hand, Follow Me!

“Get lost!” Ao Jue tore apart the incoming attacks, which was the martial technique of the Suspension Palace. The other locations were also in chaos from the battles, and the scale of this battle surpassed everyone's imagination.

The Gu Clan thought they could suppress Lin Yun with their deity’s bloodline, but they didn’t expect so many swordsmen to stand on Lin Yun’s side. They might be in a mess with no order, but they had displayed the pride of a swordsman by placing their lives on the line.

“Hahaha! That’s satisfying!” Xiong Tiannan faced four opponents by himself and fully unleashed the power of his Golden Crow Divine Physique.

Ji Zixi and Lin Jiangxian weren’t weak either. They withstood the aura of the deity’s bloodline, holding their ground. After all, the Gu Clan had activated their bloodline and even formed into an array.

But Gu Jun was in a pathetic state. His opponent was Lin Yun, who ignored everyone else and came after him. Lin Yun pushed his Divine Light Sword Intent to the limit as he suppressed Gu Jun.

This made Gu Jun feel aggrieved, and he would have his face slapped by Lin Yun if he wasn’t careful.

“As expected of the Golden Jade Divine Physique. If you didn’t have it, your head would’ve blown up,” Lin Yun mocked.

Gu Jun was furious as he charged forth, wanting to rely on the deity’s bloodline to suppress Lin Yun. But Lin Yun was agile and had no weakness in his sword aura. No matter how furious Gu Jun was, he couldn’t touch Lin Yun no matter how much he tried.

Lin Yun wasn’t a fool but his Dragon’s Blood was boiling, and each attack could easily inflict heavy injuries on a seventh-stage Saint Lord. When a sword ray shone out from him, it formed into azure dragons that were wandering around. This was to help the other swordsmen to withstand the aura of the deity’s bloodline, or they would suffer a considerable loss.

Gu Jun nearly threw out blood because he couldn’t touch Lin Yun, no matter how much he tried. He was in the array and should have the advantage in the fight. But there wasn’t anything he could do under Lin Yun’s sword techniques. He even wanted to summon his constellation to deal with Lin Yun, but thinking that Lin Yun didn’t even draw his sword, he could only endure it.

“Oh my god! What’s going on?”

“Hahaha! This is very exciting!”

“Lin Yun is really strong. He won the other swordsmen over and they’re willing to make a move for him.”

“Is this still the arrogant Divine Clan? How many people from the Azure Cloud Realm have suffered a grievance because of the Divine Clan?”

“This is really shocking.” Many cultivators forgot they were still taking part in a test and could feel their blood boiling. When they saw Lin Yun give Gu Jun a beating, they couldn’t help smiling. They were happy that someone could finally teach the Divine Clan a lesson. This was because they could only suck it up whenever they were bullied by the Divine Clan before.

A huge commotion came on the stairs, with a powerful pressure sweeping out, making everyone fall to their knees. This caused Lin Yun and the Gu Clan to be shocked as both parties took a few steps back.

“It’s the Deity Slaughter Monument!”

“Someone left their name on the Deity Slaughter Monument!” Everyone raised their heads and looked at the golden radiance with golden flowers descending. In the end, the flowers formed into three fruits that someone grabbed.

This left many people shocked and couldn’t recover for a long time. Anyone could guess that the three fruits were highly precious, and they were rewards given by the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity.

“That person managed to leave his name on it and made three golden radiances appear,” Ao Jue said as he approached Lin Yun’s side.

“There’s a reward...” Lin Yun needed resources now. A seventh-stage Saint Lord was unique because one could try and make a breakthrough after reaching the pinnacle. There wasn’t any bottleneck, but the tribulation was dangerous, and one required resources to compensate for the exhaustion required. He could tell that the three fruits were treasures. Thinking about it, Lin Yun’s face sank, and he looked at Gu Jun, “Get lost!”

Gu Jun’s face became cold, and he wanted to refute it, but a voice suddenly resounded in his ears, “Let him come.”

When Gu Jun heard that voice, he became excited, and smiled, “Lin Yun, do you think that you can leave your name on the Deity Slaughter Monument? I’ll tell you beforehand. I’m not the only one who wants your Golden Dao Fruit, and I’m afraid everyone will become even more attracted after seeing how strong you are. It’s a crime to possess treasures, so you can come if you have the guts. I’ll wait for you at the Deity Slaughter Monument!”

He sounded as though he was afraid that Lin Yun wouldn’t go. He glared at all the swordsmen before stopping on Ao Jue. His face was vicious, and he said, “Hahaha! You guys want to get through the test after offending my Divine Clan? None of you can escape!

“Let’s go!” Gu Jun left without any hesitation.

Ao Jue rubbed his nose and smiled, “Gu Jun probably received some news, and it will be dangerous up ahead.”

Anyone could sense it from Gu Jun's actions without him saying anything.

Xiong Tiannan said, “Lin Yun, don’t care about him and just charge forth!”

Ji Zixi and Lin Jiangxian didn’t speak but they looked at Lin Yun to express their support. Lin Yun wanted to say something, but he noticed many people were looking at him, and they were all swordsmen.

“Hahaha! Isn’t Flower Burial worried about us? It doesn’t matter, we’ll charge on with you!”

“We’re here to join the fun, to begin with. So it doesn’t matter if we can leave our names on the monument.”

“The Divine Clan is too much, but we can finally vent it out.”

“Young Master Lin, don’t hesitate. We’ll charge on with you!”

“We’re swordsmen, and we all have a grudge against the Divine Clans. We have had our treasures snatched before. As swordsmen, we’re not afraid to fight!”

“Well said!” The swordsmen became even more furious as they spoke.

Lin Yun didn’t know what to say. He initially wanted to tell them not to follow him since it would be dangerous, but he didn’t expect that they were more hot-blooded than him.

“Big Brother Lin, make the decision!” Ji Zixi said. She was only seventeen or eighteen, but she became hot-blooded upon seeing this scene.

Lin Jiangxian also looked at Lin Yun, and said, “You only have to give the word. I’ll go with you no matter where we go.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Alright!” Lin Yun laughed. He raised the tree branch in his hand, and said, “Since all of you are willing to follow me, let’s just charge! With a sword in hand, follow me! We’ll kill the divine dogs!”

All the swordsmen were briefly stunned, before they laughed, ““With a sword in hand, we’ll kill the divine dogs!””

Lin Yun looked at everyone as they chanted the slogan. Everyone else was shocked when they saw this scene.

“It looks like the world is pissed with the Divine Clans!”

“They’re swordsmen, but they’re too ruthless! For the Divine Clans to be called a divine dog, hahaha!”

“It looks like Lin Yun’s fame will spread far and wide this time, and there’s a show to watch!” The other cultivators were stunned before they followed behind, increasing their speed.

The Gu Clan was fast after they activated their bloodline and sped up the stairs. It didn’t take long before they could see the outline of the Deity Slaughter Monument.

Gu Xing said beside Gu Jun, “Big Brother Jun, weren’t you a little too obvious earlier? What if Lin Yun doesn’t come?”

Gu Jun smiled, “I did it on purpose. Lin Yun will come, but those words weren’t directed at him.”

“Who were they directed to then?” Gu Xing asked.

Gu Jun said, “At those swordsmen. They might be mortal blood, but it’s troublesome once they’re banded together. Otherwise, we could have suppressed Lin Yun earlier by forming an array.”

While mentioning that, Gu Jun was furious because it was all Ao Jue’s fault.

“I only said that to intimidate the swordsmen. At that time, it will be easier to deal with Lin Yun,” Gu Jun revealed his plan.

Gu Xing briefly pondered, before he couldn’t help smiling, “Big Brother Jun is really smart...”

“”With a sword in hand, kill the divine dogs!””

Roars echoed from beneath the stairs with rippling sword intent.

“What’s going on...?” Gu Jun and Gu Xing were shocked as they turned around. They saw that the number of swordsmen had increased instead of decreased as they chanted the slogan, charging over.

This left Gu Jun and Gu Xing’s faces pale, and Gu Jun said, “Quick... Leave quickly! To the Deity Slaughter Monument!”
