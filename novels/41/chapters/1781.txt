Chapter 1782 - Divine Indigo Radiant Fist

The three swordsmen could feel a deeper meaning within Lin Yun’s words. Perhaps Lin Yun didn’t think about it that much earlier, but it was true that he wanted to walk his own path and not be limited by the paths of others.

“You made a breakthrough in the Azure Dragon Intent?” Yan Tie asked.

Lin Yun nodded his head. The breakthrough of his Azure Dragon Intent was unexpected and reasonable at the same time.

He spent four years refining the Divine Azure Blood within the Three-Lives Realm. In addition to him possessing the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, his Azure Dragon Intent had naturally accumulated to a terrifying height. Thus, he only needed an opportunity to make the breakthrough, and his enlightenment earlier was that opportunity.

But the real surprise was the Azure Dragon Sword Art. This was an interesting sword technique, and the last sword gave him infinite possibilities, born from the azure dragon, and yet, transcending the azure dragon. Perhaps the creator of this sword technique purposely did this to not restrict the future generations in the circle he drew.

Right then, a loud explosion rang out within everyone’s ears, and the cups on the table shattered. Everyone was caught off guard and could feel their eardrums trembling, making them feel uncomfortable. When Lin Yun raised his head, the Myriad Lightning Sect’s Yi Feng appeared on the stage, and he was being challenged.

As the youngest in the top ten of the Dragon Pulse Ranking, there were naturally many people who weren’t convinced about his strength. So those who wanted to make it into the top ten naturally challenged him first.

His opponent was also a formidable foe. He was a hidden expert on the Dragon Pulse Ranking named Liu Yuanzong. He was naturally strong since he dared to challenge Yi Feng. The two exchanged dozens of blows on the stage, with waves sweeping out, tearing the surrounding space apart.

“Go down!” Liu Yuanzong roared and executed a ghost spirit martial technique at Yi Feng.

Yi Feng might be young, but he wasn’t afraid at all, wearing an arrogant smile on his lips. As he stood in mid-air, purple lightning flickered on his body, and he countered with another ghost spirit martial technique.

When the two attacks clashed in mid-air, they passed by each other before hitting each other. But when Liu Yuanzong’s attack landed on him, it was dispersed by a series of lightning flickers before it even got close to him, and he was unscathed.

Meanwhile, Liu Yuanzong fell to his knees and threw out three mouthfuls of blood. Whenever he threw out a mouthful of blood, there would be fragments of his internal organs accompanied by flickering lightning. Evidently, he was seriously injured by Yi Feng’s Lightning Intent, and lost his fighting prowess.

“This attack from Yi Feng is really weird. With Liu Yuanzong’s cultivation, he shouldn’t be injured so badly.” Yan Tie said, furrowing his brows.

Nodding his head in agreement, Shi Yan said, “The penetrative power is too strong, and there’s something weird about his defensive ability too. I have fought Liu Yuanzong before, so it makes no sense that he’s incapable of dealing any injuries to Yi Feng.”

Lin Yun didn’t say a word, but he noticed some profundities. Yi Feng’s attack was similar to the Lightning Cocoon he mastered in the past. By dissolving his Lightning Intent, he could penetrate his opponent’s body before exploding the cocoon within his opponent’s body. Each strand of lightning was even finer than hair.

With Lin Yun’s Sword Heart, he saw nine thousand strands of lightning. Yi Feng was stronger than him in that factor, and he probably held back against Liu Yuanzong. Otherwise, he would’ve been dead by now without a complete corpse.

Everyone already expected that Yi Feng was strong, but they didn’t expect him to be that strong. This further proved that none of the top ten on the Dragon Pulse Ranking were pushovers.

“Blue Frost Lord, do you dare to fight me?” Defeating Liu Yuanzong could only be considered a warm-up session for Yi Feng. He then directly challenged the Blue Frost Lord.

Amongst the Four Young Masters, the Blue Frost Lord fought in the past and was strong. Before the Blue Frost Lord went on the stage, the Autumn Mountain Lord warned, “Be careful.”

The Four Young Masters were from four directions of Heavenly Domain City. Despite their competitions, they all belonged to the Divine Dragon Empire faction. Unlike the geniuses from the holy lands, the fight between Yi Feng and the Blue Frost Lord could be considered a confrontation between two forces.

Before the Martial Dao Tea Party started, people were speculating about who was stronger between the Four Young Masters and the six holy lands’ representatives. There was a huge controversy, and both parties were officially fighting now. This naturally brought the atmosphere of the tea party to a whole new level.

“Don’t worry about it. He’s just a brat, and he can’t hurt me.” The Blue Frost Lord seemed confident and came to the Thunderstorm Battlestage.

After the Blue Frost Lord landed on the ground, they both moved simultaneously. Yi Feng was like a bolt of lightning appearing behind the Blue Frost Lord. He then executed the Indigo Radiant Terranian!

Yi Feng’s punch was accompanied by massive lightning energy, but a white icy dragon claw blocked it. This dragon claw was from the Blue Frost Lord. When he turned around, he had a skinny frame and was as cold as ice.

The Blue Frost Lord then raised his hand and pushed his palm forth, which manifested into a dragon claw, easily blocking Yi Feng’s attack. When the punch enveloped in lightning clashed with the dragon claw, they were both knocked flying away.

“Indigo Lightning Radiant Sun!” Yi Feng laughed as he retreated and continued to bombard the Blue Frost Lord with another punch. His punch was like an indigo sun condensed with lightning that streaked across the horizon like a meteorite.

“Divine Dragon Skybreaking Finger!” Facing Yi Feng’s attack, the Blue Frost Lord’s right hand manifested into a dragon’s claw, and he unleashed a series of ice spikes. Looking from afar, those short blades looked like they were thrown out by a dragon, which easily resolved Yi Feng’s attacks.

When they landed, they both tapped on the ground before charging at each other. When they executed their attacks, their movements were slow and clearly visible. But when they landed on the ground, their movements suddenly became so fast that they couldn't be seen with the naked eye, giving everyone a misperception that space was in a mess.

“Divine Indigo Radiant Fist!”

“Divine Bluefrost Fist!” They both executed their ultimate moves, one from a holy land’s inheritance and the other from the Divine Dragon Empire. They were both evenly matched when they clashed.

As lightning and snowflakes filled the sky, their afterimages could be seen all over the stage.

“Divine Indigo Radiant Fist—Dragon Tribulation!” Yi Feng finally executed the ultimate move of the Divine Indigo Radiant Fist, using Lightning Intent to mimic the dragon pulse tribulation, and the power had reached the limit of the ghost spirit martial technique.

The Thunderblood Battlestage was instantly enveloped with thunderclouds, and the tribulation clouds began to rumble within the sky. Whenever the tribulation clouds clashed, a dragon tribulation might really descend.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

This made Lin Yun lock his brows within the pavilion because if he fought Yi Feng, it might really detonate his tribulation.

“Dragon tribulation? Haha. Everyone in the world might be afraid of the tribulation, but not me!” The Blue Frost Lord said, but he didn’t dare to be careless.

As he soared to the sky, he formed a White Dragon Seal and unleashed a barrage of attacks at Yi Feng’s punch. The white divine dragon seal was filled with an ancient aura with unimaginable, surging chill. Whenever he threw his punch, the thunderclouds would dissipate a little, and a white dragon would appear in the sky.

Ten-odd punches later, the sky behind the Blue Frost Lord was filled with ten-odd white divine dragons. When the dragons soared to the sky, Blue Frost Lord’s aura soared, and he unleashed a horrifying aura.

But Yi Feng’s performance wasn’t weak. The thunderclouds behind him manifested into nine lightning vortexes that appeared to be connected with the power of heaven and earth. Whenever he threw his punch, lightning would descend from the sky.

When the two faced off, the auras they released continued to clash. Yi Feng was hovering in mid-air, and he couldn’t obtain the upper hand. He couldn’t help sneering, “The Dragon Clan’s martial techniques are profound, so it’s no wonder why the Blue Frost Lord neglected the inheritance of your clan. But how long can you hold on? My dragon tribulation is endless. The more you last, the stronger the tribulation will become.”

The Blue Frost Lord was naturally aware of that, and he could sense the lightning energy accumulating within his body. This was also the tribulation energy, which he had just suppressed for now, in case he couldn’t defeat his opponent before the tribulation energy detonated within his body.

“You’re rejoicing too early.” The Blue Frost Lord took a deep breath, and his pupils flashed with a cold light. The dragons in the air all rushed into his body. When his aura soared, he flew to the sky and charged towards Yi Feng. Since he would lose if he waited, he might as well take the gamble.

A dazzling sphere of light appeared between their fists when they clashed in mid-air. The next moment, the sphere of tribulation energy and white dragon energy detonated.

They spat out a mouthful of blood each, but Yi Feng remained in the air and didn’t step back. Meanwhile, the Blue Frost Lord was knocked to the ground. Before he could even stand up, Yi Feng was already charging over with his punch.

Since the tribulation energy within the Blue Frost Lord could no longer be suppressed, it suddenly detonated. The surface of his body was soon covered in cracks with blood seeping out.

“How is this possible?!” The Blue Frost Lord was surprised. After all, he was stronger than Yi Feng in terms of cultivation, so it made no sense for him to suffer a loss in that strike. Yi Feng should be the one suffering a loss instead.

Wiping the blood off his lips, Yi Feng smiled, “I have merged a Devour Saint Rune into my Divine Indigo Radiant Fist. So as long as it’s within my acceptance range, I can devour thirty percent of any attacks directed at me. I can rebound another thirty percent of the attack by combining the Divine Indigo Radiant Fist with the Indigo Thunder Saint Canon. This means only forty percent of your attack managed to hurt me.”

Yi Feng was pretty confident and didn’t mind sharing his secret.

The Blue Frost Lord’s face was ugly, and he should’ve guessed that when Yi Feng wasn’t injured when facing Liu Yuanzong.

As the Autumn Mountain Lord inwardly sighed, he said, “The Myriad Lightning Sect’s Yi Feng wins!”

“Yi Feng actually won!”

“He looked like he still had some energy left, and the Blue Frost Lord’s state is a little pathetic.”

“He's a genius from a holy land, so the Four Young Masters are somewhat lacking in comparison.” Everyone guessed the Blue Frost Lord would lose, but they never expected he would lose so terribly, especially to Yi Feng, the youngest amongst the top ten.

With the Martial Dao Tea Party coming this far, everyone roughly had a ranking within their hearts. The top three should be the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Ji Lingfeng, Heavenly Dao Sect’s Xiao Yuanqi, and the unfathomable Autumn Mountain Lord.

As for the other seven, they should be the Myriad Lightning Sect’s Yi Feng, Heavenly Flame Sect’s Yan Chihuo, Divine Dao Pavilion’s Lin Qingyang, Ming Cult’s Yu Wenxiu, Wind Edge Lord, Blue Frost Lord, and the Snow Master Lord. After that should be Lin Yun and the three swordsmen.

But the main focus was who could be first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking and if Lin Yun could defeat any of the seven to make it into the top ten. But no one was optimistic about it because those in the top ten were on a whole new different level.

As for challenging the top three, no one bothered discussing it because it was simply impossible. Since it was impossible, there was naturally no way to discuss it. He might have a chance against those ranked from the fourth to tenth but not the top three.
