Chapter 797 - Payback!

Lin Tao’s face was angry like an asura that had just crawled out of hell, unlike his usual gentle temperament. At this moment, he was full of ferocity. When he stood up, a torrential heat wave swept through the crowd. It was clear that Lin Tao was angry.

Examining Lin Yun’s choice, the crowd could empathize with him. It made sense to them that Lin Yun didn’t want to lose three rounds. If Lin Yun was certain that he couldn’t defeat the swordsmen, then it made sense that he would try his luck with Lin Tao. It turned out that the crowd severely underestimated Lin Yun who calmly ascended the stage.

Lin Tao, who was confident that Lin Yun would give up, felt his face burn red from humiliation as he walked to the stage. Only then did the heatwave disappear, relieving the spectators.

“You’re not targeting me? Do you really think you can obtain the quota?” Lin Tao didn’t believe Lin Yun’s words at all. In his mind, Lin Yun was just trying to avoid three losses. So, he would make Lin Yun regret his decision!

“Why can’t I?” Lin Yun asked.

Hearing Lin Yun’s reply, Lin Tao was briefly stunned before he laughed, “Do you think you’re invincible just because you defeated some garbage? You want to obtain the quota? Please, you’re not qualified. At the very least, I don’t acknowledge you!”

“If you don’t acknowledge me…” Lin Yun looked at Lin Tao before he said, “Then I’ll just have to cut you down.”

The moment he said that an unparalleled sharp aura shot out of Lin Yun’s eyes as he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra.

“Haha!” Lin Tao laughed before he spoke coldly, “I’ve seen arrogant people, but I’ve never seen someone as arrogant as you. Let me wake you up from your dream. Your journey in this banquet is ending now!”

Lin Tao smirked at Lin Yun before he charged forward. His movements were so explosive that he turned into a streak of fire.

“What speed!” Lin Yun squinted his eyes. Lin Tao wasn’t just fast, but he was also domineering. Lin Yun responded with a gentle shift as his Golden Crow Seal appeared. The Cloudsoaring Art was his trump card and he didn’t want to reveal it unless absolutely necessary.

After Lin Yun moved his body half an inch, flames suddenly exploded in front of him that unleashed a vast heatwave. At the same time, Lin Tao punched Lin Yun like a spear. With an attack so ruthless, Lin Tao was clearly trying to cripple Lin Yun. This was the price Lin Yun would have to pay for making him lose the quota.

After all, his fight with Lin Yun would benefit Nangong Wanyu and Li Mubai. When Lin Tao thought about this more, rage burst out of his chest.

Lin Yun swung his sword and clashed with Lin Tao, causing sparks to fly. It was clear that Lin Tao’s fist was like a well-tempered weapon.

“Your sword is rather quick.” Lin Tao smiled seeing that Lin Yun could still draw his sword after being forced into this situation. But his voice soon turned cold, “But this is only the beginning of my Thousand Purgatory Fist!”

When he finished speaking, a crimson glow appeared around his fist. This made Lin Yun’s face change as he suddenly sensed an extremely dangerous aura and slashed out, executing the Thunderbolt Slash.

Practically in a split second, sword rays from eighteen thunderbolts flew out.

“Pitiful tricks!” Lin Tao’s body trembled as boundless origin energy assailed the thunderbolts, destroying them completely. Then, without giving Lin Yun a chance to react, he disappeared. When he reappeared, he quickly threw a punch.

His punch was terrifyingly fast, so it hit Lin Yun’s right shoulder before the latter could defend with his sword. The origin energy covering Lin Yun was pierced through and his clothes were torn apart. In the wake of this attack, Lin Yun had five bloody holes in his shoulder that dyed his clothes red.

Everyone sucked in a cold breath at this scene because Lin Yun got injured so quickly. This was shocking since it was the first time Lin Yun suffered an injury in the banquet.

“Lin Tao is truly worthy of being the sect master’s secluded disciple!”

“Injuring Lin Yun in three moves, wow. He’s truly worthy of being one of the seven elites.”

“I’m afraid Lin Yun’s winning streak will come to an end.”

Pavilion Master Plum and the rest from the Great Qin Empire couldn’t help feeling worried. Lin Tao used his terrifying cultivation to easily crush Lin Yun’s overlord sword. This was something that Lin Yun had never expected.

“Haha, didn’t I say it before? That guy is a clown. He’s meant to be crippled.” Yan Long’zi quickly stood up to mock Lin Yun.

“Senior brother, it seems like he only suffered superficial injuries though.”

“Lin Yun is actually a little terrifying since he was able to avoid suffering fatal injuries,” said another disciple.

“Hmph!” Yan Long’zi snorted. “I’m not blind, but this is just the beginning. The main show hasn’t arrived yet. What? Do you guys think that you have better eyesight than me? Dream on! Lin Yun will be crippled after this battle!”

Only Yue Weiwei was unhappy after hearing Yan Long’zi’s bragging. She glanced at Yan Long’zi only to find him sneering at her. Yan Long’zi purposely spoke against Lin Yun so that Yue Weiwei would hear his words. He wanted to get back at her. He didn’t believe that the pavilion master dared to do anything to him with the banquet concluding soon. After all, the pavilion master wouldn’t risk the Heavenly Demon Pavilion losing a top three spot.

Lin Tao sneered after he saw Lin Yun’s blood. But when he saw Lin Yun’s injuries, he squinted his eyes. He knew how terrifying his attack was and he was confident that an ordinary swordsman would be killed by it. Now he understood why Lin Yun had the courage to stand before him. So it turns out Lin Yun also cultivates his physique.

Interesting. Does he think that he can suppress me with his physique since he can’t suppress Nangong Wanyu and Li Mubai with his sword?

“You’re the first to injure me.” Lin Yun examined his injuries briefly and then smiled coldly. He enjoyed the pressure he felt during the banquet because it would be too boring if it was easy. After being injured, he had to admit that Lin Tao was a lot stronger than Ji Feng.

“You’re not bad yourself. I underestimated you, but unfortunately for you, I have a complete grasp on your strength now. Why don’t you bring out your body-refining technique? How long are you going to hide it for?” Lin Tao’s eyes glowed as he put pressure on Lin Yun.

Body-refining technique? The spectators were shocked when they heard that. Evidently, they didn’t expect that Lin Yun actually cultivated a body-refining technique in addition to being a swordsman.

“As you wish.” Lin Yun sheathed his sword. Surprising everyone, he stabbed his sword into the ground and cracked the stage.

All the geniuses watching the fight sucked in a cold breath when Lin Yun discarded his sword. They had no idea what he was trying to do.

Lin Tao’s face turned terrifyingly dark when he saw this scene. He thought that Lin Yun was arrogant before, but Lin Yun proved him wrong. Lin Yun wasn’t just arrogant, but he was completely disregarding Lin Tao.

“What arrogance!” Lin Tao snorted as crimson flames blazed around him and magma-like origin energy flowed out of his body. With these changes, Lin Tao’s body grew larger and turned metallic as he unleashed a terrifying aura.

“Profound Yang Battle Physique!” yelled Lin Tao. At this moment, Lin Tao looked like a demonic ape.

“That’s the Profound Yang Palace’s forbidden technique. I heard that no one successfully cultivated it in the last millennium!”

“Looks like Lin Tao is really giving up on the quota by revealing his trump card early on.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s mainly because Lin Yun is too stubborn to admit defeat. Lin Tao is so angry and is determined to cripple Lin Yun!” This scene had left many people shocked.

“Lin Yun, I advise you to draw your sword. Otherwise, I’m afraid that I’ll kill you.” Lin Tao gnashed his teeth with killing aura surging in his eyes.

“I don’t need you to tell me what to do. I’m merely paying you back what you gave me!” Lin Yun looked at Lin Tao’s surging killing aura and clenched his fist. Although he didn’t speak up before, he was angry. However, everyone got the wrong idea that he didn’t have a temper. In reality, Lin Yun didn’t want to waste his time to explain himself to the crowd.

Did Lin Tao really think that he was a pushover? Not only did Lin Tao provoke him several times, he even claimed that he would kill him. Since Lin Tao dared to humiliate him, Lin Yun would make him pay.

“Azure Dragon Battle Physique!” Lin Yun said coldly as a dragon roar echoed out.
