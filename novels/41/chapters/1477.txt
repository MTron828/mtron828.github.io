Chapter 1478 - Cultivating On The Saint Mountain (1)

The Saint Mountain looked like a huge dragon coiled on the ground if one looked from afar and also a sharp sword that pierced into the fleeting clouds.

Lin Yun stopped at the foot of the mountain and looked at it. Even if this was the second time he looked at Saint Mountain, he couldn’t help feeling shocked. Ye Ziling and the others have been cultivating on Saint Mountain for six months, something that no one dared to think of. Most importantly, they could receive daily guidance from their saints, which was really enviable.

The guards let him in after checking his identity. After Lin Yun entered Saint Mountain, he swiftly went to a cave. This cave was covered with blooming peach blossoms, with petals that covered the ground like a carpet, emitting a charming fragrance.

Since the petals covered the ground, there would be rustling sounds if he stepped on them. It had been six months, and the peach blossoms were still beautiful. When Lin Yun found the Radiant Sword Saint deep in the peach blossom forest, he bowed, “Disciple greets Master!”

The Radiant Sword Saint was still painting on the stone stage and didn’t seem anxious about his lifespan coming to an end. The Radiant Sword Saint placed his brush down, and looked at Lin Yun with an amicable smile. “Come here. Tell me about your experience for the past six months.”

It didn’t seem like a meeting between a master and disciple but two family members. The Radiant Sword Saint had lived for a long time, so he was relatively indifferent to many things now that he was running out of lifespan. If it wasn’t for the fact that he bore the responsibility of the Sword Sect, he wouldn’t be that persistent about life and death.

No swordsmen believed in fate or were afraid of the heavens. So naturally, they weren’t scared of death, either. The Radiant Sword Saint had a special feeling for Lin Yun. Lin Yun not only came from the Profound Amber Realm and the Sword Firmament Pavilion, but it was also very likely that Lin Yun would be his last disciple.

Lin Yun was nervous when he faced the Radiant Sword Saint. So he briefly calmed down before he told the Radiant Sword Saint what had happened over the past six months.

When the Radiant Sword Saint heard what he said, he couldn’t help smiling. But when he heard what Lin Yun did during the Five Peaks Competition, he said, “The seven peaks originate from the same sect, and we’re all fellow disciples of the same sect. You can compete amongst yourselves, but don’t form any grudges.”

“Disciple Lin Yun will keep your words to heart.” Lin Yun nodded because he also shared the same thoughts. Regardless of the sect master or others from the Sword Sect, he could feel that the Sword Sect wasn’t like the other sects. The relationship between everyone was a lot deeper in the Sword Sect, and they were all straightforward as swordsmen.

There weren’t any conspiracies or schemes. They might have their own pride, but they would also honestly admit defeat if they lost.

“Perform the Aquaheaven Sword Technique again.” The Radiant Sword Saint looked at Lin Yun. “Let me take a look at it for you.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Lin Yun inwardly rejoiced when he heard that because that was also what he planned to do. He drew his sword without any hesitation and executed the profundities of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique that he comprehended.

His sword technique had four different intents: clouds, water, moon, and heaven. They formed, intertwined, and combined differently, instantly mixing into over a hundred phenomena. At the end of the sword technique, the phenomenon created by the Aquaheaven Sword Technique looked gorgeous.

Splitting clouds welcomes the moon. As flowers dance under the moonlight, you and the moon are both real in the world!

As I watched the world from the sky, you’re as beautiful as the moon!

When Lin Yun performed the Aquaheaven Sword Technique, the Radiant Sword Saint was surprised and exclaimed, “This is no longer the Aquaheaven Sword Technique.”

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun cupped his hands together. “Master, please guide me.”

“I told you previously that there is the minuscule and deification stage above the manifestation stage. There’s no doubt that you have already reached the deification stage in this sword technique. This is also the reason why I’m curious because it should be impossible for you to reach it right now.” The Radiant Sword Saint said as he fell into deep thoughts.

“What’s the requirement, then?” Lin Yun asked.

“Fifth-grade sword intent, also called Heavenly Dome Sword Intent!” The Radiant Sword Saint looked at Lin Yun, and he could naturally tell that Lin Yun had reached the quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

Knowing that the fifth-grade sword intent was called the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and pondered about it. The names of each grade was a type of sword intent and deciphering it could allow him to grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, just like Firmament Sword Intent.

So there must also be a profundity in the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent that acts as a key for swordsmen.

“Let’s not talk about the fifth-grade sword intent for now. I can tell from this sword technique that you’re missing someone,” said the Radiant Sword Saint.

“Missing someone…” Lin Yun was a little at a loss when he heard that.

“I was done unconsciously by you, and it’s not something you can control. You combined your yearning into your sword technique, which is why it has reached the deification stage when you shouldn’t have reached that level, in the beginning.” The Radiant Sword Saint explained.

When Lin Yun heard that, he instantly thought of Su Ziyao and knew what was happening. Who else could it be if it wasn’t Su Ziyao, whose beauty was comparable to the moon?

“This is a good thing. Sit down. I’ll talk to you about the fifth-grade sword intent.” The Radiant Sword Saint looked at Lin Yun, and continued, “The Heavenly Dome Sword Intent takes over the firmament. The profundities lie in these words: ‘I am the sky, my sword as the dome, and one with the sword.’”

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed, feeling that he had caught something at that moment.

“‘I’m a man, a man who’s the heaven. My sword as a dome, and the dome is also the heavens.’ One with the sword means the fusion of two heavens. The Firmament Sword Intent lies in manifesting the heaven, but you’re ultimately mimicking, and there’s no way you can be compared to the real heaven. So you have to merge with your sword and become one…” The Radiant Sword Saint explained.

Lin Yun finally understood what the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent meant and nodded, “Disciple Lin Yun understands now.”

But the Radiant Sword Saint shook his head and didn’t say a word. He didn’t think Lin Yun understood what he said or he wouldn’t be in his current state.

“You’re going to leave the sect?” The Radiant Sword Saint suddenly asked.

“Master, how did you manage to know that I’m planning to leave?” Lin Yun was surprised.

“Saints have grasped the Saint Dao, and this means that we can perceive the changes in the world. I don’t know what you’re thinking, but I can tell you that your mood is a little hazy. Can you tell me about it?” The Radiant Sword Saint replied.

Lin Yun briefly pondered before sharing the information he had about the Divine Dragon Bone with the Radiant Sword Saint.

“It’s no wonder why.” The Radiant Sword Saint finally understood why Lin Yun’s mood was hazy. Lin Yun would’ve taken the initiative to tell him if it was something else, but the Divine Dragon Bone was a big deal.

He could still find a way if Lin Yun needed other treasures, but the Divine Dragon Bone was different and troublesome. Then again, it didn’t mean he had no way of obtaining one. After all, he was one of the three Sword Saints, and his connections weren’t something others could imagine.

When Lin Yun saw his master pondering, he quickly said, “Master, I wish to deal with this matter myself.”

“When are you going to leave the sect?” The Radiant Sword Saint asked.

“In about a month.”

“Then stay here and cultivate for the next month.”

Lin Yun was stunned when he heard that. His master only had five years of his lifespan left and yet he was going to dedicate a month to him. This instantly made Lin Yun unsure about how to respond.

“You don’t have to worry about me. Stay here for the next month. It’s also time for you to practice your Carefree 9 Swords!”

The Radiant Sword Saint had already spoken this much. So he had no choice but to accept it. He just hoped the Radiant Sword Saint could make a breakthrough soon and become comparable to the Emperors.
