Chapter 1968 - Cowering (2)

“Alright. Bai Shuying, you can leave first,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“Understood.” Bai Shuying cupped her hands together as she examined Lin Yun. But there was a smear of disdain flashing across her pupils.

This made Lin Yun smile bitterly, and he could only pretend he didn’t see the disdain within her pupils.

After Bai Shuying left, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked, “Why didn’t you agree?”

“Martial Aunt, do you want to hear lies or the truth?” Lin Yun asked, raising his head.

“What do you think?”

“Let’s not mention that she’ll limit her cultivation to the Profound Death Stage. If her cultivation is the same as mine, she’d only lose if she fights me,” Lin Yun said calmly.

“Your temper is really like your master’s. In the end, you’re still looking down on my Heavenly Jade’s lineage,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said in a playful tone.

But Lin Yun could only feign ignorance and commented, “It’s true that the Dragon Origin Great Saint doesn’t have a good temper.”

As the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint basked in the saint radiance, she didn’t dwell on that with Lin Yun and said, “How far have you reached in the Divine Firefly Sword?”

“I’m only short of the thirteenth sword form, Myriad Swords Unite.”

“How far have you reached in each sword form?”

“Above complete mastery, the manifestation stage.”

“Let me take a look at your Divine Firefly Sword.”

“Understood.” Lin Yun took a deep breath and took several steps back. After he drew the Flower Burial Sword, he began to perform the Divine Firefly Sword created by the Sword Ancestor. Executing the Firefly Radiance, Dawn Radiance, Sunset Radiance, Waning Moon, Heavenly Snowing Mountain, Silver Blood, Indigothunder Azurefrost, Rising Sun, and Radiant Moon Heart!

Lin Yun began to perform the Divine Firefly Sword in the plaza before the Dustless Palace, fully exhibiting the profundities of the sword technique. Many of the majestic intents looked ethereal when he performed them. This was the manifestation stage, making the sword technique entirely into his, using it as he wished.

“I apologize for my embarrassing performance.” Lin Yun cupped his hands after sheathing his sword.

“Do you really think it’s embarrassing?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked.

“What?” Lin Yun was baffled.

“Looking at you, do you really think you can receive my praises?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said in disdain.

“I dare not think about it.”

“You’re saying that you don’t dare to think about it, but I’m afraid that you dare in your heart.”

“I also don’t dare in my heart.” Lin Yun could feel his scalp going numb after being targeted by the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. He had no choice but to clamp his tail between his legs.

Even his senior brother feared the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, so what could he do?

“Since you’re a swordsman, you should know that the manifestation stage isn’t the limit,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“I know.”

“Why didn’t you practice since you know?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked.

“Now isn’t the time yet,” Lin Yun said. He continued, “I have a feeling that the Divine Firefly Sword is only a key. The thirteen sword forms might seem unpredictable, but it’s only this sword technique’s tip of the iceberg. So it’s not time for me to bring it to the miniscule stage yet.”

“Not bad. At least you’re not too foolish. Have you ever wondered why you can’t master the thirteenth sword form?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked after praising Lin Yun.

“The thirteenth sword form is too profound, and I’m too stupid to comprehend it,” Lin Yun said.

He attempted the Myriad Swords Unite multiple times, and it was different from the twelve sword forms. He couldn’t comprehend the thirteenth sword, no matter how he tried, but he didn’t place it in his heart because the current Divine Firefly Sword was enough for him.

“Ha,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint sneered.

Lin Yun could only tremble uneasily. After interacting with her back in the Solar Jade Palace, he couldn’t help feeling nervous when facing the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint didn’t even reveal her murderous intent once, but he couldn’t help fearing her for some reason. Even her sneer would make his hair stand on end.

“In my opinion, there is so much trash within the Heavenly Dao Sect that it makes you feel proud and can’t be bothered to practice the thirteenth sword form,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

Lin Yun’s face changed, but he could only grit his teeth and reply, “Martial Aunt is right.”

“I’ll be honest with you. Shuying already learned the thirteenth sword form a year ago,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, and Lin Yun could feel a terrifying chill accompanying her voice.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that, and he muttered, “How is that possible?!”

“Why is it not possible?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked. “She has been accompanying me ever since she was young, receiving my guidance daily. So she’s stronger than you, whether it’s in terms of her foundation or talent. Do you think it’s impossible now?”

Lin Yun was speechless, and his thoughts processed rapidly. When he learned that Bai Shuying had mastered the thirteenth sword form, he couldn’t believe it because even he failed. His senior brother has always praised him, and many saint elders were shocked when he performed the sixth sword form.

This gave him a misperception that he was the best, making him complacent. So the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s words were equivalent to cold water being poured down on him.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint mumbled, “Do you still think you can defeat Shuying now?”

When Lin Yun was thinking about how to respond, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint roared, “You’re just Radiant’s disciple, so what is there to hide? Lin Yun, how long are you going to disguise yourself in front of me?!”

Lin Yun’s mind blew apart with a vibrating sound as an outburst of saint radiance exploded from the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, causing heaven and earth to tremble. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s appearance before him.

Her beauty was flawless, with a cinnabar mark on her forehead, looking like condensed love and resentment for the past thousand years.

Her elegance was peerless and unrivaled, and this was a significant blow to Lin Yun, regardless of having his actual name called out, her peerless appearance, or the cinnabar mark on her forehead. This made Lin Yun feel a little overwhelmed, and he felt that his master had conned him.

After all, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s resentment against his master was a little too great.
