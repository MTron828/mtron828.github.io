Chapter 1327 - Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda

When Qin Cang opened his eyes, the most mysterious and strongest genius on the Empyrean Ranking had finally awakened like a true dragon. He was enveloped in a sacred light that made him possess an extraordinary temperament.

“This is a true transcendent…” Everyone exclaimed when they saw this scene. Transcendents represented the monster of monsters, and only those outstanding ones could be known as transcendents.

But in reality, transcendents had another name and this meant transcending the ordinary ranks. This was the feeling that Qin Cang gave everyone right now. It was as though he was no longer a mortal. Then again, this was just an illusion and only those in the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm could barely reach that level.

The Elysium Core Realm was divided into the Lesser, Greater, and Heavenly. If Lesser and Greater only had a small gap, then Heavenly represented a whole new level. After reaching the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, they would have to gather dragon aura to make preparations for the final breakthrough.

If they managed to take that step out, they would reach the Dragon Pulse Realm, and the Dragon Pulse Realm was also known as the Divine Dragon Nine Transformations.

Those who had walked on the path of the Divine Dragon Nine Transformations meant that they were no longer purely mortal. Nine dragon pulses would be born in their bodies, and each dragon pulse represented a transformation to become a saint.

Before the Dragon Pulse Realm, they were all mortals. But after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, they were already on the path of a saint. It wasn’t easy to reach the Dragon Pulse Realm, and the birth of every expert in the Dragon Pulse Realm was a tough journey. Each transformation meant one tribulation, and most people failed to reach the last transformation. So those who could complete the nine transformations were all monsters.

Above the Dragon Pulse Realm was the Samsara Edict Realm, and they were all transcendent geniuses when they were young or they had heaven-defying opportunities. As for saints, they were even rarer.

Qin Cang was only at the Lesser Elysium Core Realm, but he already had a transcendent temperament. Normally speaking, this temperament was something that only those at the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm could possess.

“Isn’t this a little too terrifying…don’t tell me that he already possesses the strength of a Heavenly Elysium Core Realm?” Everyone was in disbelief.

“Nothing too heaven-defying. It’s just his temperament. But as long as a Heavenly Elysium Core Realm doesn’t appear, no one will be able to suppress him!”

“Looks like the Profound Wither Island is really filled with opportunities. The Great Saint Origin hasn’t even appeared yet, and the fated transcendents are already so strong.”

“He’s out!” When Qin Cang appeared, several elders from the Profound Sky Sect respectfully appeared. Among the group who came for Qin Cang, Lei Jue and Xuan Ying were also among them.

“Oh? The two of you failed to deal with Flower Burial?” Qin Cang was shocked because Lei Jue and Xuan Ying should also have refined an origin saint rune each.

When Lei Jue and Xuan Ying quickly explained, Qin Cang’s eyes became dark after listening to them before he said, “What a pity. I thought that the two of you weren’t his opponent. If that’s the case, then it’ll be somewhat interesting. I’ll continue to hand this matter to the two of you. Remember not to take his life. I want to bring him back to the clan.”

When he was done, he turned to look in the direction of the Great Saint Origin with excitement blazing in his pupils. Unlike what others think, Qin Cang didn’t have any killing intent for Lin Yun, at least he didn’t show any on the surface.

In reality, that was also the case. Qin Cang had no feelings for the Nether Divinity Realm Son. It just so happens that he was also from the Nether Divinity Clan. His main objective was the Great Saint Origin, since it would probably make the ancestral master look at him in a new light.

His ancestral master was the Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, the sect master of the Profound Sky Sect, Tian Xuanzi. He was a deity-like figure in everyone’s heart.

“Compared to the Great Saint Origin, Lin Yun is nothing. So the Great Saint Origin will be mine, no matter what!” Qin Cang’s eyes blazed with flames before he flew towards the sky with everyone else following behind him.

Outside the Profound Wither Island, everyone took a long time to calm themselves down. Qin Cang had become terrifyingly strong after refining the Demonflame Lotus.

“That junior is too terrifying…” The Sword-Bearing Elder of the Sword Sect, Lin Zhen’s face was ugly. Sikong Zhou also had a huge opportunity in the Profound Wither Island, engraving an origin saint rune on his elysium core that matched his sword path well. But he knew that Sikong Zhou was still somewhat lacking compared to Qin Cang.

This also meant that the Great Saint Origin would probably fall into the hands of the Profound Sky Sect. Thinking about it here, Lin Zhen couldn’t help looking at the Profound Sky Sect’s campsite. Over there, everyone was calm, as if they had already expected this scene a long time ago.

When a light suddenly shone out from there, Lin Zhen’s face changed as he focused on a person covered in a hood. Although this person was wearing a hood, Lin Zhen instantly recognized them. This person was Zhuge Qingyun, the most outstanding disciple of the Profound Sky Saint Sovereign. He could even sense that Zhuge Qingyun was wearing a smile beneath his hood that showed his confidence.

As fated transcendents began to appear on the Profound Wither Island, everyone outside the Profound Wither Island was shocked by how strong they had become. One must know that before entering the island, they were only at the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm, and they were all geniuses on the Empyrean Ranking.

Who could’ve thought that in just slightly over a month, everyone would make such drastic progress in their strength? Before this, everyone still thought that those at the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts would be invincible after entering the Profound Wither Island, and even fated transcendents would have to be somewhat fearful of them.

But Flower Burial’s appearance gave them a slap on their faces, not to mention that the appearance of the fated transcendents gave them a huge impact. The so-called “transcendents” weren’t ordinary, and they were all blessed by fate.

“Looks like there will be a nice show to watch today. There are so many people who are called ‘fated transcendents’, but not everyone has the qualification to be known as one…”

“That’s right. So let us see who’s the true fated transcendent!”

“They might have reached the Elysium Core Realm, but there shouldn’t be able changes on the Empyrean Ranking yet. So this battle can determine the strongest Empyrean!” All the geniuses on the Empyrean Ranking were gathered on the Profound Wither Island, and this was a grand event for everyone.

If it wasn’t for the Profound Wither Great Saint’s fame, it would be hard to gather so many people in one place for a fight. This was the final battle as representatives from the Empyrean Ranking, so there was a different meaning behind this fight. Not only would it determine the owner of the Great Saint Origin, but it would also determine who was the strongest Empyrean in the Ancient Barren Domain. After all, everyone had entered the island as Empyreans.

When most of the geniuses rushed towards the Great Saint Origin, they were all blocked by an invincible force when they tried to fly over. The pagoda was emitting a light that had formed into a barrier, stopping everyone from approaching it.

Many people didn’t want to believe it, but all of them had failed. A Greater Elysium Core Realm even brought out their constellation to try and resist the pressure to ascend the pagoda. But his constellation was crushed before he was thrown away.

This scene was terrifying, and this instantly dispelled many people’s thoughts. In the end, they could only wait patiently with reverence in their hearts for the pagoda.

Lin Yun’s group was already there for some time now, but they didn’t dare to be reckless despite the fact that they were filled with anticipation for the pagoda.

“This pagoda looks like a saint artifact!” Lin Yun looked at the pagoda for a long time and could feel an ancient and majestic aura coming from it.

“This should be a divine artifact. This pagoda was forged from the bones of divine dragons, and it’s called the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, or Glazed Tile Pagoda for short. It has nine ancient divine runes engraved on it. It’s on the Divine Artifact Rankings, and it has a huge origin,” explained Su Ziyao.

Lin Yun was shocked that this was actually a divine artifact. The ancient pagoda was far in the starry sky, but Su Ziyao actually managed to recognize it with just a glance. He had a feeling that even the elders from the powerful sects outside the Profound Wither Island might not be able to recognize the pagoda since it was enveloped in light and only the rough outline could be seen.

“The Glazed Tile Pagoda?” Lil’ Purple became emotional inside the sword box, and she even wanted to come out of it. But there were too many people here, and she was also afraid of Su Ziyao. So she could only hole up in the sword box. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Then, those who obtain the Great Saint Origin will grasp this pagoda?” Lin Yun asked in an anticipating tone.

“It won’t be that easy. The Profound Wither Great Saint could only unleash one-tenth of the pagoda’s power when he was alive. If he had grasped it fully, not even the Nine Emperors could do anything to him,” replied Su Ziyao.

“Is this the reason why he was in trouble?” Ye Ziling asked. She had an extraordinary origin, so she naturally knew more secrets than others, especially since it had involved the Nine Emperors. Even the elders of the powerful sects might not know as much as her.

“No.” Su Ziyao shook her head. “This Glazed Tile Pagoda isn’t ordinary, but it has been greatly weakened after losing the profound amber seven treasure. Someone once relied on this pagoda and became invincible in the dark age, but he was killed by the Southern Emperor. Compared to the three treasures left behind by the Southern Emperor, the value of this pagoda is a lot lower. It is only one of the Southern Emperor’s trophies and there’s no way it will attract the attention of the eight other emperors.”

Ye Ziling was surprised when she heard that. She was only asking about it casually, but she didn’t think that Su Ziyao would have an answer. At the same time, Lin Yun also had bellows in his heart, but he was thinking about something else instead.

The Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng leveled two peaks of the Sword Sect with one sword. He was someone who could challenge the entire holy land by himself, dealing a huge impact on the Sword Sect that the Sword Sect still couldn’t recover from.

Meanwhile, the Southern Emperor had killed the former owner of this divine artifact. So just how strong were the Nine Emperors three thousand years ago? Were they all monsters?

Lin Yun turned to look at Su Ziyao. The Drifting Goblet once mentioned that she came from the Profound Imperial Palace, and she was the holy maiden there. But he had no idea if she had the bloodline or was the heir of The Empress. But regardless of being the former or latter, they were still shocking enough.

Sensing Lin Yun’s gaze, Su Ziyao asked, “What are you thinking about?”

“I’m just thinking about how I can get you to marry me.” Lin Yun winked and answered seriously.

“It won’t be easy. You will have to work hard. But I’ll be waiting for you.” Su Ziyao smiled. She didn’t have the bashfulness of other girls, nor was she bothered by the gazes of others. She likes to be direct. An empress wouldn’t fall for someone easily, and they wouldn’t change their heart the moment they do.
