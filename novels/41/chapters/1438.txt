Chapter 1439 - Divine Firmament Peak's Blessing

The surrounding waterfalls rumbled like thunder. A heavy fog was hidden beneath the pool, containing unimaginable astral energy.

As starlight surged and holy light soared, Mu Chuan and Feng Luan stood side by side as they watched Lin Yun and Chen Ling sink into the Saint Pool. Countless disciples rushed over to watch the two descend. Their eyes were filled with envy. They envied Lin Yun’s strength and Chen Ling’s luck.

After all, no one would give Chen Ling a chance if they were in Lin Yun’s position, but Lin Yun gave it. The Saint Pool Baptism was only held once every six months. So one could imagine how rare the opportunity was. After all, it was astral saint energy from the saint vein, and it wasn’t the same as ordinary astral energy. It had unimaginable benefits to disciples in the Elysium Core Realm.

“Chen Ling is really lucky. After this baptism, he should be able to reach the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm!”

“That’s for sure. He’s already at the pinnacle of two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have fought Lin Yun so ferociously…” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I wonder how far Lin Yun can go.”

“I’m guessing the pinnacle of Greater Elysium Core Realm. If I remember correctly, he had reached the Greater Elysium Core Realm three days ago.”

“Reaching the pinnacle of Greater Elysium Core Realm with one baptism can probably save him half a year of hard work. But he shouldn’t benefit as much as Chen Ling, and I bet he won’t last long. After all, his cultivation is limited how much astral saint energy he can absorb.”

As Saint Pool Square fell into a discussion, Mu Chuan turned to Feng Luan and asked, “How long do you think he can last in the Saint Pool?”

“He managed to refine eighteen innate saint auras in the Lesser Elysium Core Realm. This means that his cultivation technique isn’t ordinary. Moreover, he also has a strong physique. So I’m guessing he’ll surprise everyone by lasting seven days!” Feng Luan said after a brief pondering.

Accepting the baptism wasn’t easy because it didn’t mean you could absorb however much you wanted. Firstly, there was a bottleneck in the cultivation, so the upper limit was already there. Secondly, many undercurrents in the Saint Pool would constantly crash against the body. If one remained inside for too long, they may even lose their life.

“You only lasted five days back then, right? Your evaluation of him is pretty high.” Mu Chuan smiled before he continued, “But your evaluation of him is still too low. I’m betting he can stay in the Saint Pool for at least ten days!”

Feng Luan was startled when he heard that. The highest record in the Sword Sect was eighteen days, a record set by Jian Jingtian. Even now, only Gu Ruochen, who was first on the Heaven Ranking, couldn’t accomplish it. So Feng Luan was surprised that the peak master’s evaluation of Lin Yun was higher than Gu Ruochen.

Not long after Chen Ling and Lin Yun entered the Saint Pool, they passed through the heavy fog and finally reached the surface of the Saint Pool.

“Lin Yun, thank you. And I’m sorry about what happened before!” Chen Ling sent a solemn look at Lin Yun. He wasn’t good with his words, but Lin Yun was why he could receive the baptism this time. So whenever he recalled how he wanted to defeat Lin Yun earlier, he couldn’t help feeling guilty.

“Why thank me? I have always had a good temper, and you didn’t offend me.” Lin Yun smiled and continued, “You’re qualified to receive the baptism since you’re able to force me to summon the fourth constellation painting. Moreover, we’re both disciples of the Divine Firmament Peak.”

Looking at Lin Yun’s sincere gaze, Chen Ling heavily nodded. He believed what Lin Yun said. No matter what others say in the future, he would believe that Lin Yun had a good temper.

“Let’s go. We’ll see who can last longer!” Lin Yun spread his arms apart before he dove into the Saint Pool.

After Chen Ling came to his senses, he quickly followed him.

When Lin Yun dove into the Saint Pool, he quickly sank down and could sense the boundless astral saint energy in the surroundings. When the water pressure came from every direction, Lin Yun could sense the endless astral saint energy entering his body. His Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon also began to circulate and greedily devoured the astral saint energy.

“How comfortable…” Lin Yun was surprised and could feel his cultivation rapidly soaring. This was an unprecedented feeling. Most importantly, cultivating the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon required a lot of resources.

His cultivation was slow, no matter how many Divine Astral Pellets he had, especially after he reached the second stage and condensing the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron. This easily multiplied the resources he needed by ten or even a hundred times. So this was simply a godsent opportunity.

“Should I go down and take a look?” Lin Yun looked down and saw a golden membrane at the bottom of the pool that made it look like even the soil was gold. He could sense that the astral saint energy contained within it had reached an unimaginable density. Ultimately, he decided to go down and take a look as he shot down like an arrow.

“Where’s he?” Chen Ling was surprised when he entered the pool. It was just the blink of an eye, and Lin Yun was nowhere to be seen. He still hadn’t reminded Lin Yun that there was an astral vortex at the bottom of the pool. It was hazardous, and one would be heavily injured if they weren’t careful.

“Lin Yun is smart, so he probably knows what he’s doing…” Chen Ling soon tossed it to the back of his mind and focused on absorbing the surrounding astral saint energy. He had to cherish this rare opportunity.

When Lin Yun swam three thousand meters down, he noticed something wasn’t right. The surrounding temperature had sharply dropped. Besides, there would be undercurrents from time to time. It was like a dragon was colliding against his body.

He didn’t hesitate to summon the three thousand and eight dragon runes on his body. When the undercurrent collided against him, ripples spread out on the surface of his body and rang out like a bell deep in the pool.

As Lin Yun continued to descend and reached a depth of eight thousand meters, he finally saw a terrifying vortex that was stirring. Sacred light was radiated from it like silk, containing unimaginable power. When some undercurrents clashed against each other, Lin Yun could feel his eardrums ringing nonstop.

As Lin Yun floated in the water, he looked at the bottom of the Saint Pool with a great thirst. He could feel that his heart skipped a beat with his blood flow facing tremendous pressure. It felt as though he would bleed from his seven orifices at any time, and his heart might burst out of his body.

“What a pity…” Lin Yun ultimately choose to give up. If he was swept to the bottom of the pool with the current strength of his physique, he might lose his life.

“Lin Yun, let Lil’ Red out. This place is good, and it might be able to try and make a breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm!” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the sword box.

Lin Yun briefly pondered before he said, “You can come out, too. This is a great place, and I don’t know when the next time will be if we miss this opportunity.”

“It won’t be good if I’m discovered…” Lil’ Purple hesitated. They had joined the Sword Sect, and this wasn’t appropriate. But Lin Yun could tell that she was tempted by his suggestion.

“Then don’t let anyone discover you. You’re the Supreme Heavenly Slaughtering Empress. Just treat it as you owe the Sword Sect one. You just have to return the favor in the future.” Lin Yun smiled, dispelling Lil’ Purple’s concerns.

“Hehe. That’s what I was thinking as well.” Lil’ Purple smiled before she came out of the sword box together with Lil’ Red.

When Lil’ Red came out, it didn’t hesitate to activate the Devour Saint Rune and started absorbing countless sacred lights eight thousand meters deep in the Saint Pool. It didn’t take long for a vortex to be formed around Lil’ Red as it rapidly devoured the astral saint energy.

This instantly made Lin Yun jealous. Lil’ Red had an ancient bloodline, which meant that it had a stronger physique than humans, not to mention that it also had the Devour Saint Rune. So it was practically cheating since it was refining at speed ten times faster than Chen Ling.

“This empress will start as well.” Lil’ Purple’s eyes flashed with excitement as she sat down, and her hair soon turned silver. The aura of a phoenix was also spreading out. It didn’t take long for a vortex bigger than Lil’ Red to appear around her.

“Damn…” The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched because they were a little too much. He instantly regretted letting the two of them out and wondered if his senior brother would kill him when he came out. After all, this would exhaust at least a century of accumulation from the Saint Pool.

But speaking of which, Lil’ Purple seemed to be even more beautiful lately, and she seemed to have grown a little taller as well. Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts as he held onto his chin. Ever since the Phoenix Tree came to life, something about Lil’ Purple had changed, and she went into slumber more often.

“Forget it. I should get started as well!” Lin Yun recollected himself and crossed his legs together before moving the elysium core that hovered above the ocean of astral energy. As the golden ocean roared with huge waves bellowing, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron slowly rose from the golden ocean.

When the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron was out of the ocean, a vortex bigger than Lil’ Red’s and Lil’ Purple’s appeared and the golden light that looked like golden sand flew towards the vortex.

This made Lil’ Red and Lil’ Purple open their eyes. They were both surprised when they saw the terrifying vortex swirling behind Lin Yun.

“This monster!” Lil’ Purple unhappily complained as her silver hair grew, and devoured more astral saint energy.

Meanwhile, Mu Chuan and a few elders smiled, feeling that it was a great blessing that the Divine Firmament Peak had Lin Yun.
