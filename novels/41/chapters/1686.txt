Chapter 1687 – I’m A Barbarian!

“Oh? Lin Wan said that you’re a musician. How can such a young musician not have an inheritance?” Mu Xueling asked with doubt filled in her pupils.

“Saint Elder, he must be lying. Her Highness, Profound Fairy, probably made a mistake. Just get him to get lost. There’s no need to waste time with him.”

“Yeah. Her Highness, Profound Fairy, probably didn’t meet him herself.”

“I’m afraid many people will be unconvinced to let him join our Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.”

Lin Yun’s earlier words caused several elders to speak out, and their pupils were dissatisfied.

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi’s faces changed as they became anxious. But Lin Yun was calm as he replied, “My master is a secluded person, and I have always been by myself. So I don’t have any sect.”

When the other elders wanted to say something, Mu Xueling said, “It doesn’t matter. I’m only asking casually. We won’t question the origin of our candidates, even if you’re a demonic cultivator. Remove your mask.”

Lin Yun’s heart trembled. He suspected Mu Xueling had noticed something. After all, she was a Quasi-Saint. If she had guessed correctly, she must be a Master Musician, since she was a Saint Elder, grasping the Imperial Tone.

If his identity was seen through by Mu Xueling, he would die in the Heavenly Domain City, even if he wouldn’t die in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. But Lin Yun had already expected this before coming, and he knew that he had to face it. He could also use this Quasi-Saint to test the Divine Tortoise Transformation.

If Mu Xueling couldn’t see through his disguise, the Divine Tortoise Transformation could also fool the other Saints. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun removed his mask and revealed his appearance.

When he removed his mask, he could sense a powerful gaze directed at him, wanting to see through all his secrets. The gaze was from Mu Xueling, and she was shocked because she could tell Lin Yun was heavily injured. But she was also sure that this person wasn’t in disguise.

Lin Yun’s martial cultivation might be ordinary, but his dragon origin was massive, so his aptitude wasn’t bad. She could even sense a pure azure dragon’s aura from Lin Yun with a hint of Thunderstorm Intent around him. Even if he had concealed himself, it still couldn’t disguise the aura of the azure dragon. That was the Azure Dragon Saint Physique.

She could also sense that the saint runes in his profound palace weren’t simple, and he was at least a fourth-grade Saint Spiritualist; this meant he had a strong mental cultivation. But she didn’t sense it before. Could it be because of that Silver Moon Mask? This also explained why he wore that mask, which should be a secret treasure with an extraordinary origin.

With just a gaze, Mu Xueling could see through Lin Yun’s state. Then again, there was no way she could see through any more of Lin Yun’s secrets without using a secret technique. With her strength, and her junior sister’s recommendation, she didn’t mind giving Lin Yun some special treatment.

But he shouldn’t be someone her junior sister had chosen. Yue Weiwei probably had never seen this person, so this might be related to Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi. Thinking about it, Mu Xueling breathed a sigh of relief because she thought her junior sister had fallen for someone. If that was the case, then it would be a huge matter. She wouldn’t have prepared such a massive formation if she knew Lin Yun didn’t have a relationship with her junior sister.

“Alright. You can join the others half a month from now to participate in the final test.” Mu Xueling announced.

The other elders were surprised as they looked at Mu Xueling. One of them couldn’t help asking, “Saint Elder, don’t we have to test his attainment in music dao?”

“There’s no need.” Mu Xueling replied indifferently. With Lin Yun’s cultivation as a fourth-grade Saint Spiritualist and the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, there was no doubt he was a musician and not weak. Mu Xueling had already made her judgment when Lin Yun removed his mask.

“Thank you, Saint Elder.” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi expressed their gratitude, and Lin Yun finally responded at this moment because all Mu Xueling did was glance at him. Thus, he couldn’t help taking a glance at Mu Xueling.

“I’m not convinced!” A person stood out.

“Senior Brother Liu Feng!”

“I heard that he was brushed down on the ninth test. He’s probably here to cause trouble.”

“That’s for sure. Everyone must go through nine tests before participating in the final test. But this person doesn’t need to participate in those tests. So how can Senior Brother Liu take it lying down? If he didn’t make a mistake, he should be able to participate in the final test.”

“I’m afraid that he’s not the only one unhappy. But Senior Brother Liu is the strongest.” Everyone’s faces changed when they saw the person who stood out, and they instantly guessed Liu Feng’s intention.

“Liu Feng pays his greetings to Saint Elder.” Liu Feng glared at Lin Yun before cupping his hands together.

“I thought he was someone strong, but he turns out to be a barbarian with no background. I’m not convinced that he can participate in the final test!” Liu Feng said. “If he can participate in the final test, it is unfair. I’m afraid the other martial brothers and sisters won’t be convinced, either.”

“Liu Feng, what the hell are you doing? He’s recommenced by Her Highness, Profound Fairy. Are you unhappy with Her Highness?” Liu Wan said. When everyone heard that, they immediately swallowed their words down.

Liu Feng couldn’t be bothered since he had decided to stand out. He coldly said, “I naturally don’t dare to disrespect Her Highness. But I’m afraid Her Highness didn’t even meet this person. Otherwise, why would you two bring him to the Saint Altar, instead?”

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi’s faces changed because what Liu Feng said was the truth. Seeing this, Liu Feng smiled, and his belief that Lin Xiao was a piece of garbage firmed up his confidence.

He didn’t know how this person managed to get on Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi’s good side to make Her Highness repay this favor for them. But he snickered, “It looks like I’m right. This fellow hasn’t met Her Highness. Then again, how can someone like him possess the qualifications to meet Her Highness?”

But hearing what he said, Lin Yun became even more curious about this ‘Her Highness’ he spoke of. But just when both sides were about to continue to argue, Lin Yun smiled, “It’s normal that there will be those who are unconvinced. I wouldn’t be convinced either if I was in your position. Speak, how do you want me to make you convinced?”

“I already guessed that a barbarian like you would say that. Simple, I’ll be convinced if you can defeat me, and no one will be able to question your qualification at that time.” Liu Feng smiled. “But it’s unavoidable that we won’t be able to hold back entirely in a spar. So don’t blame me for not giving Her Highness face when I injure you later.”

“Liu Feng, you’re too much!” Lin Wan’s pupils flashed with fury.

“I’m too much? He can give up if he’s afraid.” Liu Feng replied with his pupils still glued on Lin Yun. He was already confident that Lin Yun was a barbarian.

“Admit defeat?” Lin Yun wore a cold smirk and continued, “I’m afraid that the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion will be humiliated if I accidentally heavily injure you.”

As a terrifying chill swept out from Lin Yun, no one dared to directly look at his cold gaze. His words also surprised the elders on the stage because Lin Yun was too arrogant.

“Since that’s the case, Liu Feng, go and experience his strength and see if he can embarrass our Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion!” A middle-aged man at the left of Mu Xueling said coldly.

Liu Feng rejoiced when he heard that because he knew this was a golden opportunity for him to regain his qualification. He immediately cupped his hands together, “This disciple will do my best not to disappoint!”

As he turned to look at Lin Yun, he said, “Since the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion can be one of the Four Musical Houses, we naturally have plenty of people coming to challenge us, but they all lost terribly. You will soon discover the difference between me and a barbarian like you!”

Mu Xueling and the other elders didn’t say anything since they clearly wanted to see how Lin Yun would deal with this matter. But no matter what, this naturally made Lin Yun unhappy. After all, they previously declared that he could just join the final test, but a nobody stepped out now, which ruined it all.

Squinting his eyes, Lin Yun smiled, “Come on, then.”

With a wave of his hand, Liu Feng retrieved a golden flute. This was a saint artifact, and ancient floral runes were engraved on it.

On the other hand, Lin Yun waved his hand and retrieved the Thunderstorm Zither from his interspatial bracelet. When the zither appeared, a faint dragon roar rippled out.

“That’s a good zither!” Many people could tell that the Thunderstorm Zither wasn’t simple, and their attention was captivated by it.

Liu Feng was briefly stunned because this meant that Lin Yun definitely had some background. Realizing that, he kept his contempt for Lin Yun.

Waving his hand with a smile, Lin Yun slammed his palm on the zither and the zither flew toward Liu Feng like a boulder. This instantly made Liu Feng’s face change. He had just raised his flute to his lips, but he could sense an immense aura blowing toward him before he could play the flute. He didn’t hesitate to tap his foot on the ground and retreated.

But Lin Yun’s speed was faster than his. After he slammed his palm on the zither again, it flew out like an arrow and manifested a thunderstorm with his Azure Dragon Saint Physique.

Without the sword box, his speed was much faster, and he looked like a bolt of lightning in the eyes of others. When the lightning bolt condensed, Lin Yun appeared before Liu Feng ahead of the zither with a grin.

“You!” Liu Feng finally panicked. With no choice, he placed the golden flute down and took another step back. Alas, he was too late.

When Lin Yun grabbed onto the zither, he poured ninety thousand dragon runes into the zither. When the weight of the zither was instantly increased to a hundred thousand cauldrons of strength, it smashed against Liu Feng.

The armor that Liu Feng wore had immediately shattered, along with his bones, and he threw out a mouthful of blood. After Liu Feng was sent flying away, he fell to his knees and furiously looked at Lin Yun, “You cheated!”

“How did I cheat? Did we agree that we would compete in our music dao?” Lin Yun grinned, and his face became sinister. “Not to mention that I’m a barbarian!”

Without any hesitation, he slammed the Thunderstorm Zither forth once more. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Stop!” The elders on the stage were dumbfounded as they got on their feet.

But Lin Yun ignored them and continued to attack Liu Feng. Since they made him unhappy, he naturally didn’t have to go easy on them. So what if he was in their territory? That was never his concern.
