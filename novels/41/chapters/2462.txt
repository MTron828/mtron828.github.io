Chapter 2463 - Here As Promised

Lin Yun was half-submerged in the Iris Secret Realm’s Myriad Lightning Lake, closing his eyes and allowing lightning to flash on his body.

The Myriad Lightning Lake was a body-refining ground in the Iris Secret Realm. It was a ruin in the past, but it had been restored. The lightning in the lake was so dense that it looked like magma, and it felt comfortable for Lin Yun as the lightning was tempering his Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique.

After chatting with his master about the ninth-grade sword intent, Lin Yun went into seclusion. He would practice his sword technique during the day and be submerged in the Myriad Lightning Lake in the remaining time. He had already stabilized his cultivation in the Great Saint Realm.

But the Iris Sword Box sealed the remnant energies in the Heavenly Dragon Bone, and he didn’t dare to make a breakthrough recklessly. The rise in his cultivation was too fast, and he felt he could make a breakthrough to the Boundless or even the Immortal Stage.

The boundless stage meant the undying of the soul, while the immortal stage meant the immortality of the physique. This was why Lin Yun tempered his physique, allowing his Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique to improve. If he couldn’t suppress his cultivation one day, his physique could withstand it entirely.

An hour later, Lin Yun jumped out from the Myriad Lightning Lake. When he subconsciously released the Heavenly Dragon’s aura, this enveloped the entire Iris Secret Realm in a powerful pressure. He quickly put on his clothes and began practicing his sword technique.

His sword technique became even more profound when Lin Yun practiced the Heavenly Dragon Sword. Under the empowerment of the Heavenly Dragon’s authority, the sword ray he released was dazzling. Each sword was like an attack from an actual Heavenly Dragon, releasing a terrifying pressure that even space began to fluctuate.

Lin Yun released the Nirvana Dao with a thought, executing the Nirvana Sword Domain. His sword ray was like a Heavenly Dragon’s claw, reaching out and dragging a patch of space back. With a flick of his sword ray, the space ‘curtain’ swept back.

“Interesting...” Lin Yun smiled. As he swung the sword around him, it felt like he was in the water, and space turned into a tornado so that even space was slowed down. The seven sovereign divine runes merged into this region, causing heaven and earth to tremble and the spatial tornado to dissolve.

“Holy shit, don’t tear apart our home!” Lil’ Purple jumped down the Phoenix Tree and knocked Lin Yun on his head.

“It hurts!” Lin Yun smiled, grabbing onto his head.

“The space here cannot be compared to Kunlun Realm, and it can’t withstand your power. We’ve gathered seven sovereign divine runes with great difficulty, but will you tear this place apart? It’ll be fine after the Phoenix Tree grows a little more,” Lil’ Purple said aggrievedly.

“Alright, calm down.” Lin Yun apologized and comforted Lil’ Purple. He continued, “I now understand why those big shots are so obsessed with Eternal Daos. The limit of Eternal Daos is too high.”

“Are you regretting it now?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Of course not. Let’s not mention that the ninth-grade sword dao is comparable to Eternal Daos. Even if it’s not, the sword in my hand can easily control Yin-Yang and Nirvana Daos,” Lin Yun smiled. He continued, “The path as a swordsman isn’t easy, but I’m more determined after researching the Qilin Sword Canon.”

Lil’ Purple thought of something and asked, “Oh, right. You said that you met the Ancestral Deity outside. Did it say anything about the sword in your body, and can you draw it out?”

Lin Yun kept the Flower Burial Sword and replied, “He did explain it. My soul was divided into two, one in the Profound Amber Realm and the other in Old Kunlun. The sword merged my soul, which is a perfect reincarnation.”

“So...can you draw that sword out?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Who knows...he said that people would die if it were drawn...” Lin Yun didn’t dwell on this topic because he might meet the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity again if he left Kunlun Realm. He wants to meet the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity himself and not a thought.

Three days later, they finally head towards the Skysolute City with the Radiant Sword Emperor leading the six martial brothers and sisters to gather on the Scarlet Firmament Peak, where Mu Xuankong was waiting to send them off. But even after chatting for some time, the Radiant Sword Emperor still had no intentions of leaving.

“Are you waiting for someone?” Lin Yun asked.

“Yeah. They’re your acquaintances,” Ye Guhan smiled.

“My acquaintances?” Lin Yun was curious. But he soon knew who they were as the Thousand Plume Great Saint arrived on the Scarlet Firmament Peak with Bai Shuying and Dao Yang Holy Son. They greeted Mu Xuankong before walking to the Radiant Sword Emperor and chatting.

As for Dao Yang Holy Son and Bai Shuying, they headed towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun smiled, “Brother Daoyang, Senior Sister Bai, it has been long since we last met.”

Bai Shuying looked more beautiful than before and smiled, “Indeed, it has. Ye Qingtian!”

Lin Yun smiled awkwardly because that was his dark history.

Dao Yang Holy Son smiled, “Who could’ve thought that the famous Holy Maiden Killer would turn out to be Flower Burial? Now, he even became the strongest beneath the Emperor Realm.”

Lin Yun’s other martial brothers and sisters couldn’t help laughing upon hearing that.

Feng Yu smiled, “Lin Yun, are you the one who peeked at the holy maiden showering, or was it Ye Qingtian? Don’t push everything on Ye Qingtian!”

Everyone laughed upon hearing that, and Lin Yun changed the topic. He looked at Dao Yang Holy Son, and he asked, “You found the Emperor Sword?”

“I found it, but it’s too overbearing. I wanted to bring it back multiple times but was kicked back out. It even...toyed around with me on purpose,” the Dao Yang Holy Son sighed.

Lin Yun held onto his chin because the Emperor Sword feared him. So, he didn’t expect it to be so overbearing when facing another person, not to mention that it even toyed around with Dao Yang Holy Son.

“I’ll try again next time,” Lin Yun said.

“Alright, I’ve been waiting for that from you, Flower Burial.” Before the Dao Yang Holy Son even spoke out, the Thousand Plume Great Saint and Radiant Sword Emperor walked over.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled, “I was telling your master that the Heavenly Dao Sect and Sword Sect can merge if you can find the Emperor Sword back, bringing it back to protect the Eastern Desolation in the future.”

Lin Yun was surprised because he didn’t expect that his master also wanted the merge.

“No hurry on that. Let’s head to the Skysolute City,” the Radiant Sword Emperor smiled.

The Skysolute City was located in the Central Plains, far from the Ancient Barren Domain. Even with cultivation in the Saint Realm, reaching it would take a few months. The main reason was that there were many forbidden grounds that even Saints didn’t dare to step in.

But it wasn’t that dangerous to Emperors. With the Radiant Sword Emperor’s strength, it only took two days for them to reach the Skysolute City’s region with his disciples and the trio from the Heavenly Dao Sect. If it was the Radiant Sword Emperor by himself, he could shatter the restraint of space and increase his speed.

In the Central Plains was a divine mountain called the Heavenly Divine Mountain. This mountain was the tallest in the Kunlun Realm. Even Emperors would have a tough time climbing up, and Saints couldn’t even reach the waist of the mountain.

There were rumors that the summit was where the Sword Emperor cultivated, with sword rays manifesting into a dazzling sun and had never extinguished for the past three thousand years. That was the sword intent left behind by Yu Qingfeng. Thus, one could see a bizarre scene in the Skysolute City with two suns hanging in the sky.

At night, the sun manifested by sword intent was like a moon hanging in the sky, making the actual moon tiny in comparison. Meanwhile, the Skysolute City was majestic, and the city looked like a miracle.

On the boundless plains, a towering status pointed his sword forth with his right hand, and his right hand supported a majestic city. The city was massive, looking on the same level as the summit. That giant sword would occasionally give off a sword buzz. If one looked at it carefully, the statue was Yu Qingfeng’s appearance.

When the Radiant Sword Emperor’s group landed, he raised his head to see a dazzling sword ray. Aside from the Radiant Sword Emperor, everyone was shocked with their faces changed. Lin Yun wasn’t an exception, but he soon recollected himself. Looking at the statue again, he discovered the sword tip pointed to a far place at least a thousand miles away.

“This is the Skysolute City,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint exclaimed. “I came here once when I was young, and it’s still majestic looking at it again.”

“I heard that the sword ray would blind those with malicious thoughts, and they would kneel on the ground if they struggled,” Jian Jingtian said.

Not only them but many cultivators were on their ground with their faces white in the surroundings. Some lay on the ground and couldn’t even get up, while some covered their eyes with blood dripping from the seep of their fingers.

Lin Yun’s group was fine; even Feng Jue felt no pressure. But everyone knew that the Radiant Sword Emperor blocked it for them.

“There are two suns,” Bai Shuying said, raising her head. There were two bright suns at the top of the Heavenly Divine Mountain, and their radiance wasn’t inferior to each other. They couldn’t even discern which was the actual sun.

When Lin Yun looked at the summit of the mountain, there was a path hidden in the clouds at the summit.

“There’s something weird about this place. No matter which direction you land, you will look at the sword tip,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said.

“I’ll take a detour from the back!” The Dao Yang Holy Son said.

“The back is a forbidden ground, and it was Kunlun Realm’s biggest sword mound in the past. Many swordsmen came here before their death. So, it’s best if you don’t go there,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled.

Dao Yang Holy Son trembled and couldn’t help lingering in fear.

“How are we going to go up then?” Jian Jingtian asked.

“This region is a no-flight zone. Even Emperors would be suppressed by that sword and could only walk under the statue. They can only climb up the status after being given a jade token by Skysolute City’s Sword-Bearer,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said.

“So many rules? Let me give it a try!” Jian Jingtian wasn’t willing to give up and unleashed his sword intent. He gave off a dazzling sword ray that drew many people’s attention.

“Heh, another arrogant one.”

“He’ll only suffer a loss to fly here. Let’s wait and see how he’s crushed to death.” The surrounding cultivators smiled.

There were bound to be those who wouldn’t follow the rules, wanting to fly to the Skysolute City. But without any exception, they were all left heavily injured.

Jian Jingtian wasn’t an exception either, as he was sent a thousand feet away under immense pressure, groaning when he crashed down. But the Radiant Sword Emperor made a move in time, waving his hand and dragging Jian Jingtian back, protecting him from being severely injured.

“Master, thank you for saving me,” Jian Jingtian said.

“It’s best to follow the rules when you’re in someone’s territory,” the Radiant Sword Emperor smiled.

Jian Jingtian nodded before he saw the Radiant Sword Emperor soaring to the sky, instantly reaching a thousand feet away. The sword in the hand of the statue trembled, letting out a buzzing noise that echoed in heaven and earth.

Shortly after, thousands of sword rays soared to the sky from the sword mound. The statue’s sword also released a sword ray that shocked Lin Yun, and that sword aura could even heavily injure someone in the Emperor Realm.

But the Radiant Sword Emperor ignored it and smiled, “Yu Qingfeng, I’m here as promised!”

The Radiant Sword Emperor’s voice spread out, passing through the Skysolute City and reaching the Heavenly Divine Mountain.

This made the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s lips twitch because the Radiant Sword Emperor had just said to follow the rules in someone else’s territory.
