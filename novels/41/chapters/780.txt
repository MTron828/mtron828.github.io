Chapter 781 - Only The Beginning

Lin Yun used one sword again, but this time, he defeated Bai Ling. Lin Yun’s sword was simply faster than what many people could react to. So by the time the crowd realized what had happened, Bai Ling had already lost. Furthermore, Bai Ling’s defeat was miserable since he had fainted.

They could understand how Bai Ling felt. Even though Bai Ling prepared an attack with terrifying sword intent, he wasn’t able to unleash it. He was instantly defeated by Lin Yun from an attack that was too fast for him to see.

A figure flashed above Bai Ling to check his wounds. A brief moment later, the figure sighed in relief because Lin Yun had held back. Jue Chen reached out and Bai Ling’s sword flew into his hand.

But the moment Jue Chen held onto the sword, it shattered into pieces, which made Jue Chen’s face change. Jue Chen turned to look at Lin Yun and asked, “What’s the name of your sword?”

“Flower Burial.” Lin Yun replied. It was Flower Burial - burying both flowers and people.

“That’s a good name.” Jue Chen praised and continued, “Thanks.”

No one knew what he thanked Lin Yun for, but they could guess the reason. He probably thanked Lin Yun for going easy on Bai Ling. After all, everyone was shocked when Lin Yun killed Qin Yang and they knew that Lin Yun wouldn’t go easy on anyone that he wanted to kill. Furthermore, Lin Yun proved time and again that he didn’t care about the overlord forces.

Lin Yun’s act of mercy showed that he wasn’t bloodthirsty. After all, Bai Ling provoked Lin Yun, but Lin Yun chose to spare his life. As one of the seven elites, Jue Chen showed character and left after thanking Lin Yun. He had to treat Bai Ling’s injuries because this would affect his junior brother’s performance in the banquet. Jue Chen knew it would be pitiful if Bai Ling’s journey were to end now.

“So his sword is called Flower Burial. No wonder people call him Flower Burial. Lin Yun and Bai Ling might have had perfect records, but the difference between them was a little too terrifying.” A spectator observed.

“That sword was too fast. We all guessed that his sword intent was terrifying, but who would have thought that it was that terrifying.”

“Perhaps that’s what it means to be a genuine swordsman. In my view, Lin Yun, Yue Weiwei, and Bai Lixuan can reach the top three newly risen geniuses.”

“Why do I feel like he will be the number one ranked newly risen genius? I feel like he might even be able to compete with the three kings and seven elites.”

“There’s no way the three kings and seven elites can lose their position to a newly risen genius. But either way, Lin Yun’s performance was breathtaking. This Draconic Banquet is too talented.” Lin Yun’s battle was too exciting, so it drew a large commotion. The crowd was still talking about Lin Yun even after he left.

Some people held Lin Yun in reverence because they all felt a swordsman’s grace from him. His sword technique was brilliant, especially when paired with his unfathomable strength, dominance, and indifference. This all made everyone curious about Lin Yun. They all looked forward to seeing how far Lin Yun would go.

Occasionally, those in the fourth and seventh group would look at Lin Yun with great shock in their hearts, especially Ye Qingfeng. Although he expected Lin Yun would win, he didn’t think it would be in such a spectacular way. There was no question that Lin Yun had become a formidable opponent in his heart.

Even the experts from the other groups turned to look at Lin Yun. Among the seven elites, Nangong Wanyu wasn’t the only genius swordsman whose name had spread throughout the Ancient Southern Domain. There was also Li Mubai from the Heavenly Sword Sect.

His eyes were shining brightly. Prior to this battle, he paid no attention to Lin Yun. It was only after Lin Yun revealed his sword intent that Li Mubai showed interest. However, it was a small amount of interest.

Li Mubai muttered to himself and smiled, “He should be able to give me a few more surprises.”

On the other hand, the faces of the Indigomoon Elysium were ugly as they weren’t happy with this result. Even the face of Qing Ruoyou, who had been ignoring Lin Yun on purpose, was terrifyingly dark. At this moment, she was on the verge of losing her composure.

What happened back in the Swordmire City had a huge impact on her and it was something that she didn’t want to recall. But Lin Yun kept jumping around in the banquet and now he was shining brightly.

“Is there really no one capable of getting rid of him?” Qing Ruoyou asked furiously.

“Don’t worry. He’s nothing in my eyes. I’ll just get rid of him if I run into him,” said Yu Haotian.

“No. I want to defeat him myself. I want that bitch to know that this sword slave is nothing in my eyes!” Qing Ruoyou said as she gnashed her teeth while recalling the slaps that Su Ziyao gave her.

Qing Ruoyou actually hated Su Ziyao more than she hated Lin Yun. Even Yue Weiwei was an annoyance in her eyes.

Yu Haotian continued to close his eyes to meditate when he heard that. His standard was too high, so no one outside of the three kings and seven elites was worthy of his attention.

“He should be able to last three moves against me, but he’s still a piece of garbage,” said Yan Long’zi coldly. Then, he looked at Yue Weiwei who was looking at Lin Yun excitedly.

Yan Long’zi smiled, “Yue Weiwei, you seem to be familiar with Lin Yun.”

However, contrary to Yan Long’zi’s expectation, Yue Weiwei completely ignored him. This put him in an awkward position. Yan Long’zi’s cheeks trembled before he changed his approach, “Junior sister, are you familiar with Lin Yun?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Senior brother, why are you asking that? Does it involve you in any way if I’m close to Big Brother Yun?” Yue Weiwei responded to Yan Long’zi with a playful smile, but she didn’t even bother looking at him.

“I was just asking.” Yan Long’zi was briefly stunned by the way Yue Weiwei called Lin Yun. After all, it was a little too intimate. For some reason, a fire began to blaze in his heart as he roared inwardly. Now, he was determined to show Yue Weiwei how strong he was. After he made up his mind, he looked at her with greed.

The banquet continued with more fights. The performance of geniuses like Yue Weiwei and Bai Lixuan was brilliant, which added to their prestige of being undefeated. In addition to them, there were also some random geniuses whose performances were brilliant.

No one held back anymore and underdogs began to appear one after another. There were even a few geniuses who were able to force the three kings and seven elites to use more moves than usual. These performances made the banquet more exciting, but also more brutal.

Many geniuses who were previously ranked were eliminated. They weren’t even qualified to enter the ranking round, which left everyone dumbfounded. Someone roughly calculated that over thirty geniuses on the previous ranking were eliminated. Many of them were from the inner rankings and were even top-tier geniuses.

As a result, the geniuses from the previous ranking left the stage with reluctance on their face, which caused the crowd to lament. The new generation was gradually replacing the old generation. Many were destined to be eliminated since a new era was coming.

While waiting for his next match, Lin Yun rested briefly and looked at a few familiar figures. Yang Fan was in an awkward situation after two defeats. His odds of making the final ranking wasn’t high. On the other hand, Ji Wuye was only defeated once, so he had a chance to make it into the next round.

Bai Lixuan and Wu Xiaotian maintained their winning streaks. As for Yue Weiwei, the audience continued to cheer whenever she appeared; she was quite popular. At the same time, everyone came to know the name Flower Burial.

But this was only the beginning for Lin Yun because his goal was much greater than a small amount of fame. He was determined to enter the top ten. This was his promise to Su Ziyao and also his heart’s obsession. He believed that he would have a spot in the new era.
