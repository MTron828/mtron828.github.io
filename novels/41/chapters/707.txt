Chapter 708 - They're Finally Out!

When Lin Yun was sent out of the trial, he thought that he would be sent out in the same manner as he went in. But for some reason, he appeared in the coffin. Only after the coffin shook several times did he realize what was going on.

But before he could break out of the coffin, it was opened by Ouyang Hao. From the coffin, Lin Yun could see that the Skycloud Sect still had a huge formation even after suffering such a huge loss. Aside from Ouyang Hao, there were a total of five elders in the complete Yin-Yang stage.

He wondered how they would react if they knew that he wasn’t the senior they had imagined. They would probably want to skin Lin Yun alive, but it was interesting to watch them beg for their lives.

“You guys are not allowed to raise your heads. Remain kneeling,” said Lin Yun in a hoarse and cold voice, which made everyone from Skycloud Sect tremble in fear.

After all, it felt too unbelievable that an existence beyond the Empyrean Realm was still alive. But there were also those who couldn’t contain their curiosity and raised their heads. When they saw Lin Yun’s appearance, they couldn’t help being shocked.

“He’s…” But just when one of the onlookers was about to say a word, a silver sword ray shot into his forehead. This sent a chill down everyone’s spine and their legs began to tremble. Just how terrifying was this senior to kill someone with a single glance?

Lin Yun knew that he couldn’t stay for long. Spreading his arms apart, he soared into the sky and left.

After a few minutes left, Ouyang Hao finally couldn’t bear the silence anymore and raised their heads. “No one is here?”

There was no one left in the stone coffin. The other elders and disciples also raised their heads, but they too were dumbfounded.

“H-how is this possible?”

“A fragmented soul can be immortal, but I’ve never heard of anyone coming back to life…”

“Was that an illusion?” They could only categorize it as a wisp of the corpse’s soul awakened. After all, this wasn’t surprising in ruins, and when they awakened, they would usually start a massacre. But this scene was bizarre and it was simply unheard of.

Ouyang Hao frowned his brows as he could sense that there was something unusual. He came for treasures, but why did it feel like he had been fooled?

“T-that person looked similar to Lin Yun.” Someone whispered their opinion, breaking the silence.

“That’s right. He did look like Lin Yun.” Everyone started echoing their opinions. Back then, they only caught a glimpse of the corpse’s face, so they didn’t dare to say anything. Only Ouyang Hao had seen the corpse’s face clearly.

“Lin Yun? Does he look like this…” Ouyang Hao was startled as he turned around and began to describe the features of the person lying in the coffin. When he mentioned the purple mark on Lin Yun’s forehead, the disciple who spoke earlier confirmed that the person in the coffin was Lin Yun.

Previously, Ouyang Hao declared that he would kill Lin Yun if he ran into Lin Yun. So, a torrential killing aura exploded out from Ouyang Hao as boundless rage gathered in his chest. Lin Yun made him look like a fool. If news got out that he kneeled before Lin Yun and begged for his life, he would surely become a laughing stock.

For a moment, all the disciples looked at Ouyang Hao with an awkward expression.

“No one is allowed to speak a word of this. If you do, I’ll kill you!” Ouyang Hao gnashed his teeth. “That brat must be nearby. He definitely obtained the opportunity from the altar. Chase after him!”

The opportunity was what Ouyang Hao wanted, but it was snatched up by Lin Yun. When Ouyang Hao recovered from his shock, he roared so loud that his lungs nearly burst. Not only was he humiliated by Lin Yun, but he even lost the opportunity. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

A crimson aura surged from Ouyang Haon and he stomped his foot on the ground to chase after Lin Yun. But even after chasing for a long time, he could only catch a glimpse of Lin Yun’s figure.

“You thief! Where do you think you’re going!” Ouyang Hao roared as he pushed the Skycloud Art to the limit. In the blink of an eye, he covered half of the distance between him and Lin Yun. Raising the spear in his hand and pouring his origin energy into it, he threw the spear through the air like a streak of light.

“He caught up? Not bad,” said Lin Yun as he turned around and dodged the attack.

“Damn it!” Ouyang Hao cursed before catching his spear and continuing to chase after Lin Yun. He was one of the seven geniuses. His attacks might not be able to harm Lin Yun, but his attacks could slow Lin Yun down.

When Lin Yun exited the cave, he tried to stabilize his footing. However, the bronze gate behind him was pierced through by Ouyang Hao’s spear. But the spear didn’t stop and plunged into the ground in front of Lin Yun, blocking Lin Yun’s path.

Seeing this, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. He wasn’t someone afraid of trouble, but right now he was concerned with the fortune in the core region. After all, who knew if someone had their eyes on it and if fighting Ouyang Hao was a waste of time.

Ouyang Hao turned into a streak of light and appeared next to his spear. Looking at Lin Yun coldly, he gnashed his teeth, “Sword slave, where do you think you’re going?”

Looking at Lin Yun, Ouyang Hao continued, “Hand over the treasure and the Divine Indigo Radiantstone. I’ll grant you a quick death. Otherwise, I’ll drag you back to the Skycloud Sect and make a slave out of you!”

Ouyang Hao was emitting a terrifying killing aura and his face was terrifyingly dark.

Lin Yun narrowed his eyes and wore a playful smile as his sword intent began to gather in his pupils. He didn’t fear the seven geniuses before the secret realm, so there was no reason for him to cower right now. Plus, he had grown a lot stronger than before. Raising his brow, Lin Yun unleashed his sword intent and tore the surrounding killing aura apart, leaving Ouyang Hao surprised.

“Is that where your confidence comes from?” Lin Yun barked as a violent aura exploded from him. His aura instantly caused the sky to turn dark with thunderclouds tumbling in the sky. It was then followed by an ancient dragon roar that exploded out from his body.

This caught Ouyang Hao by surprise as he never expected that someone in the Yang stage would dare to attack him. Due to that, he took several steps back.

Lin Yun was currently shrouded in a purple mist as his aura became even more terrifying than before. This aura came from his physique that came from cultivating the Azure Dragon Enneaform.

Letting out a roar, the eleven dragon runes gathered on his fist. “Since you want to come after me, let me see how strong you are!”

The moment Ouyang Hao was sent flying from Lin Yun’s aura, Lin Yun’s fist had already arrived. When Lin Yun threw his punch, it felt like a volcano erupting as the sky turned dark.

“Damn it…” Ouyang Hao cursed as he never expected that Lin Yun would be so quick. Lin Yun’s strength was already comparable to the complete Yin-Yang stage. If he knew about this beforehand, he definitely wouldn’t let his guard down. But it was all too late.

Lin Yun’s fist crushed all of Ouyang Hao’s defences, causing him to throw up blood as he flew backwards. In the blink of an eye, he was sent flying out of the mist that covered the mountain.

There were many people waiting outside the mist, anticipating Lin Yun to be beaten up by Ouyang Hao. So when they saw that someone came out, they all widened their eyes and exclaimed, “Someone is flying out!”

“It must be Lin Yun! Ouyang Hao must have done this.”

“How quick. Ouyang Hao truly deserves his fame. There’s nothing Lin Yun can do before him!”

“I said this a while ago. Lin Yun can only bully geniuses like Xiang Tianhe. Anyone from the seven can easily crush him.”

“That feels great. I can’t wait to see him kneeling on the ground. Hahaha!”

Everyone began to cheer when they saw the figure flying out of the mist as it felt extremely satisfying. After all, cultivators from Skymound City were frustrated with Lin Yun ever since he snatched the Divine Indigo Radiantstone. They had been waiting for the seven geniuses to deal with him.
