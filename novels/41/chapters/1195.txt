Chapter 1196 - Young Lad, Please Go Ahead

No one had expected the battle to end so abruptly. Everyone still believed that Gongsun Yan would be undefeated because of the sky sword eye.

So who would have guessed that Lin Yun would actually find a way to break through the situation with a series of swift swords. There was also the matter of Lin Yun’s last sword that was unbelievably powerful.

“In the end, Lin Yun was still stronger. His quasi-divine firmament sword intent was too terrifying for Gongsun Yan to deal with. Although Gongsun Yan managed to confront Lin Yun with his secret technique, he couldn’t do anything without the quasi-divine firmament sword intent!” Zhao Yan sighed, “Grasping the quasi-divine firmament sword intent in the Heavenly Soul Realm... Lin Yun is determined to have his name spread throughout the Eastern Desolation.”

At this moment, the crowd recovered from their shock, “Since Lin Yun has defeated Gongsun Yan, is he the champion of the Sword Assembly?”

The sword that was forged by Feng Xuanzi was actually going to go to Lin Yun. Before the battle, everyone mocked Lin Yun for having no chance. But now, the Feng Clan wanted to find a hole to hide in it.

As for Feng Xiaoyu, she sat in a bewildered state with burning red cheeks. She was imagining how she would become a laughing stock in the city after today.

“Champion? Don’t be so sure about that…” Zhao Yan said, which caused everyone to look at him in disbelief. They had no idea what he was talking about. But Zhao Yan smiled and said, “Our Brother Gong hasn’t fought yet. Who knows, he might be able to defeat Lin Yun. Gong Haoran, what do you think?”

“You!” Gong Haoran was enraged when he heard that. He naturally knew that he could defeat Lin Yun, and challenging Lin Yun would be no different from courting humiliation. Zhao Yan was clearly taking revenge against him by trying to embarrass him publicly.

Zhao Yan was happy when he saw how enraged Gong Haoran was. At the same time, everyone realized that Zhao Yan was teasing Gong Haoran. Since Lin Yun defeated Gongsun Yan, he was the strongest person here. Clearly, his talent in the sword was much stronger than anyone could have imagined. His performance left many people wondering what his origin was.

Lin Yun looked around and asked, “Anyone else?”

When Lin Yun swept his gaze around, no one dared to look at his eyes. Ye Feifan smiled in excitement, “My Brother Lin is really overbearing!”

But his words only drew disdain from others, especially because Ye Feifan ran away when Lin Yun was called out. Ye Feifan was too shameless to cling onto Lin Yun now that he saw Lin Yun’s strength.

“According to the elders, Lin Yun will become the champion if no one else wishes to fight him.” Feng Xuanzi’s voice sounded out on the platform and reverberated through the plaza. Unlike the elders, he seemed okay despite the mess that he created.

An old man beside Feng Xuanzi asked, “Big Brother, are we really going to let Lin Yun win?”

The old man was the grand elder of the Hidden Sword Pavilion named Feng Yan. He was the younger brother of Feng Xuanzi and he had a high status in the Feng Clan. However, Feng Xuanzi ignored him and made an announcement, “The champion is Lin Yun! Grant him the sword!”

Two figures flew off the stage carrying a sword box. There was no question that the sword box contained the prize of the Sword Assembly, the saint sword crafted by Feng Xuanzi. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The sword had an eighth-grade saint rune as the core while being a hundred rune saint sword. Adding on the fact that it was crafted by Feng Xuanzi, it was comparable to a thousand rune saint sword. But a thousand rune saint artifact was so precious that many Dragon Pulse Realm experts sought after it.

The materials were rare and engraving the saint runes grew exponentially difficult with each saint rune. At many times, the success rate of crafting a thousand rune saint artifact was successful because of time. A heavenly spiritualist could only craft a thousand rune saint artifact in a century at best, and it was common to see heavenly spiritualists failing.

However, the rare thousand rune saint artifacts could take up to a millennium. Clearly, Feng Xuanzi’s skill as a craftsman was on display since his hundred rune saint artifact was comparable to a thousand rune saint artifact.

Under everyone’s envious gazes, the two servants of the Feng Clan arrived before Lin Yun with the sword box. Looking at the sword box, Lin Yun felt ripples in his heart because he knew how good this sword was. He could use it while the Flower Burial Sword took time to upgrade itself.

But it was a pity that Lin Yun had to maintain his composure. When he opened the sword box, he saw that the Incineration Sword was simple. The sword was red and was engraved with silver runes.

The two servants raised the sword box and said, “Young Master Lin, please try the sword!”

But Lin Yun didn’t make a move as he looked at the sword box. His pause made the two servants run out of patience because the Incineration Sword was heavy. After all, it was taxing for them to lift the sword box.

Even Zhao Yan was baffled and wondered if Lin Yun wasn’t satisfied with the sword, but it couldn’t be since it was the Incineration Sword.

Feng Xuanzi also locked his brows slightly because Lin Yun was being rude to a heavenly spiritualist like him. He had the ability to craft a thousand rune saint artifact and many Dragon Pulse Realm experts and saints had a good relationship with him because of that.

“Hehe. What are you afraid of with me around? It’s just a sword, so who cares if it breaks? Don’t you have ten more in your interspatial pouch?” Lil’ Purple laughed from inside the sword box. But how could the ten saint swords be comparable to the Incineration Sword?

If it really broke, Lin Yun would definitely feel heartache. But if he didn’t try the sword with so many eyes around, it would definitely humiliate Feng Xuanzi. After all, testing the sword before the craftsman was a form of respect.

Furthermore, Lin Yun knew how to hold his grudge well and many people might misinterpret a broken sword. After all, his grudge was only against Feng Xiaoyu and not Feng Xuanzi.

“Young lad, are you unsatisfied with the Incineration Sword that I made?” Feng Xuanzi’s voice sounded out.

“You must be joking, senior,” said Lin Yun.

“Then test the sword. I’ve spent a lot of effort crafting this sword. It won’t let you down even if you become a saint in the future. Since you’re the champion of the Sword Assembly today, then let everyone here get a glimpse of the Incineration Sword,” said Feng Xuanzi confidently.

“Since our pavilion master has already said it, then please give it a try.”

“Go ahead, Young Master Lin.” The two servants couldn’t wait for Lin Yun to grab the sword.

But Lin Yun smiled bitterly inwardly because he had a reason why he didn’t touch the sword. However, he didn’t have a choice. Lin Yun grabbed the crimson sword and took it out from the sword box.

Lin Yun was shocked by the weight of the sword. Zhao Yan’s sword was probably ten cauldrons heavy and this sword was at least a hundred cauldrons heavy. It would be tough for an empyrean to wield this sword without relying on their astral origin or physique.

It took a long time before Lin Yun took a deep breath and got ready. As he held the sword, it felt like a phoenix had flown out of the sword box and into the sky. The sword was simply too gorgeous.

“What a good sword!” Lin Yun couldn’t help praising the sword.

“That’s the Incineration Sword! Pavilion Master Feng’s skill in crafting the sword is really terrifying. It isn’t any inferior to a thousand rune saint artifact.”

“In terms of crafting swords, Pavilion Master Feng can definitely be ranked within the top ten.”

“Lin Yun is really lucky that he got a sword that took Pavilion Master Feng a decade to forge.” Praises sounded out from the surroundings while Feng Xuanzi stroked his beard. He was proud of this masterpiece, and he was certain that the value of his work would increase ten-fold in the future.

After all, the Hidden Sword Pavilion would never do something that made it lose money. Otherwise, they wouldn’t stay open for business. As their fame climbed, the value of their swords would also climb.

Although there were some troubles caused by Feng Xiaoyu, everyone was only focused on the sword. As Lin Yun became famous in Eastern Desolation, the Hidden Sword Pavilion would become even more famous.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he rejoiced that the sword didn’t break. But as soon as he rejoiced, a cracking noise sounded out. The sound of a phoenix cry echoed out as the sword shattered into pieces.
