Chapter 943 - Cutting Down Lives Like Weeds

“They’re really strong working together…” Lin Yun squinted his eyes watching the battle. If they fought the Gold-furred Demonic Ape individually, even Mo Yan who was the strongest among them wasn’t the demonic ape’s opponent.

As for Wu Mu and Mu Ziyu, there was naturally nothing to say about them as their flaws were too obvious. But with the three of them working together, they had completely suppressed the Gold-furred Demonic Ape.

If there were no accidents, the Gold-furred Demonic Ape would be killed by the three of them. On the other hand, Lin Yun had some confidence in facing the Gold-furred Demonic Ape albeit it would be dangerous.

Then, Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto Mu Ziyu with his eyes flashing coldly. If they clashed, he had to take this person down first and couldn’t allow him to execute the Constellation Dragonlocking Array. Otherwise, his sword aura would be a lot weaker.

Just when Lin Yun’s thoughts began to process, the intense battle in the Ashes Valley became even more intense that several of Wu Mu’s cosmic artifacts shattered with blood flowing from his wounds. But that fellow was still terrifyingly stubborn. The crimson radiance from his pupils was terrifying as it held down the Gold-furred Demonic Ape firmly.

With him standing at the front, the Gold-furred Demonic Ape couldn’t even run even if it wanted to. This also gave Mo Yan a huge room to unleash his attacks. Judging from this situation, it would just be a matter of time for the Gold-furred Demonic Ape to be defeated.

As Wu Mu was sent flying by the Gold-furred Demonic Ape once more, the last cosmic artifact on his body shattered with only the dao artifact remaining. Throwing out another mouthful of blood, the barbaric Wu Mu finally had lingering fear flashing through his pupils.

Everyone from the Demon Constellation Realm had the bloodline of the barbarian clan, and their physiques were even stronger than demonic beasts. But it was nothing before a genuine monarch demonic beast, and it was already impressive if he could last through the battle.

“Mu Ziyi, quick! Brother Wu won’t be able to hold on any longer!” Mo Yan yelled with his brows locked together.

“It’s about time. Constellation Dragonlocking Array!” Mu Ziyi laughed. The demonic bird manifested from the poisonous fog then turned into shackles under the starlight before piercing through the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s body and shooting deep into the ground.

Ten-odd shackles began to intertwine before it bound onto the Gold-furred Demonic Ape firmly. Despite being bound, the Gold-furred Demonic Ape roared furiously with flames blazing from its golden furs and unleashed a violent aura. Looking from afar, it looked like a blazing sun bound onto the ground.

Just when it struggled, the entire ground started to tremble with a shockwave spreading out. Several higher realms’ geniuses were all sent flying away with their faces becoming pale. The ferocious aura emitted from the Gold-furred Demonic Ape had left many people terrified. This was a monarch demonic beast. Even in a desperate strait, it still couldn’t be underestimated.

“Haha. My Constellation Dragonlocking Array isn’t that easy to break!” Mu Ziyu smiled with pride radiating from his pupils. He naturally had the confidence to be prideful because there weren’t many people with stronger attainments in spiritual runes compared to him. In terms of sealing technique and spiritual array control, there weren’t many who could surpass him.

“Great Sunblazing Heaven!” Taking advantage of this moment, Mo Yan laughed sinisterly as he pushed his second-grade flame intent to the limit before executing an overlord fortune martial technique towards the Gold-furred Demonic Ape. The golden light radiating from his body at this moment wasn’t any inferior compared to the ape.

After all, he was a third soul Heavenly Soul Realm genius, to begin with. So the density of his origin energy naturally far exceeded the likes of Kong Xuan. The light was so blinding that it made many people bleed from their eyes as Mo Yan combined his martial intent, cultivation, and overlord fortune martial technique together. This brought the power of this attack to a terrifying height.

As the Gold-furred Demonic Ape felt the threat of death for the first time, the fear forced it to unleash all of its potential in the desperate strait. When it began to struggle even more violently, this made Mu Ziyi surprised and caught him by surprise.

But just when it was about to break free, Mo Yan’s attack also reached as a blazing fist descended onto the Gold-furred Demonic Ape and created a huge hole in its chest. This made countless fragments of internal organs fly out from the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s wound but they were instantly incinerated into ashes by Mo Yan’s flame intent.

The Gold-furred Demonic Ape still wanted to struggle, but a silver bolt of lightning had directly pierced through its forehead. This was Wu Mu’s attack as its iron staff emitted an ancient and barbaric aura with countless dragon runes intertwining on the surface of the staff. This was an earth-shattering attack as cracks began to spread out on the demonic ape’s face before exploding.

Just like that, the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s head was only left with a firm skull and two blazing pupils. The Gold-furred Demonic Ape then fell onto the ground powerlessly with its vitality disappearing quickly. This had completely destroyed all of Wu Mu’s vitality when it was already approaching death.

When its colossal body fell onto the ground, it had caused the entire ground to tremble violently. Right at this moment, Mu Ziyi turned into a streak of light and descended while he looked at the blazing pair of pupils with excitement.

Mo Yan glanced at him briefly and said, “Your spiritual runes don't seem as terrifying as you said. The Gold-furred Demonic Ape nearly broke free.”

“But isn’t the Gold-furred Demonic Ape already dead? Hehe. Brother Mo, after you refine its beast core, your flame intent will have a high chance of reaching the third grade. At that time, you’ll rise easily in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm even if you don’t want to!” Mo Ziyi smiled awkwardly.

Mo Yan simply replied with a cold snort but his expression had loosened up. He had paid a great price this time to kill the Gold-furred Demonic Ape and even went as far as seeking help from other higher realms. Aside from paying Wu Mu and Mu Ziyi two hundred divine astral pellets, he also had to give Mu Ziyi the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s eyes and corpse to Wu Mu.

The latter was still fine as he didn’t have to take anything out from his pocket. But two hundred divine astral pellets was a little too high. He only had saved up four hundred divine astral pellets with great difficulty. But now, he had to pay so much which made his heart bleed.

But thinking about the inheritances waiting for him in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, he instantly felt that all of this was worth it as long as he could obtain the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s beast core.

Wu Mu didn’t pay any attention to the two of them and rested briefly before he stepped forth. After all, his dao artifact was still in the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s skull. But the moment he took a step out, a dazzling ray of light flashed through the horizon at an unbelievable speed.

In the path of the light, a powerful gale swept out which made Mo Yan, Wu Mu, and Mu Ziye’s faces change and raise their arms before them by instinct. This attack came too quickly and they were even pushed several steps back before they managed to stabilize themselves.

When the wind dissipated, the ray of light also disappeared. When they raised their heads, they saw an ancient sword box standing before the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s corpse with floral patterns engraving the sword box.

So it turns out that the ray of light was this sword box flying over. Before they could figure out what was going on, an azure figure wearing a hood slowly descended. There was no question that he was naturally Lin Yun. He had been waiting for the right opportunity. Now that the Gold-furred Demonic Ape was dead, he naturally couldn’t let Mo Yan retrieve its beast core.

“I’ll be taking this Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s beast core,” said Lin Yun in a mysterious tone with the hood covering half of his face.

When Mo Yan, Wu Mu, and Mu Ziye sensed that Lin Yun was only in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm, all three of them felt relieved because they thought that it was someone ranked in the top thirty on the ranking.

Mo Yan’s eyes surged with killing intent and smiled, “Aren’t you taking it a little too far? We’re the ones who killed this Gold-furred Demonic Ape with great difficulty.”

Mu Ziyi, on the other hand, wore a mocking gaze because this man was only in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Yet, he dared to rob the three of them? Did he have a nerve loose in his mind?

“An ant dares to come and bark before us? Are you tired of living?!” Two second soul Heavenly Soul Realm elites from the Blazeyang Art snorted coldly before charging towards Lin Yun. After all, they naturally couldn’t let Mo Yan deal with a piece of trash in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

Mo Yan, Mu Ziyi, and Wu Mu all wore a smile and didn’t stop them. But when Lin Yun looked at the two people charging at him, his eyes flashed with mockery. These two might be in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm, but their foundation couldn’t even be compared to Yuan Hengtian who was on the Azure Dragon Ranking. So he had no idea where these two people got their confidence from.

In the next second before Mo Yan, Mu Ziyi, and Wu Mu could keep their smile, the two elites who charged over flew back at a faster speed as they both threw out a mouthful of blood. The three couldn’t even see how Lin Yun moved because Lin Yun only raised his head and glanced at them. Just that alone, the sky sword intent in his eyes had already sent them flying out.

This scene made Mo Yan, Mu Ziyi, and Wu Mu’s faces change into grave expressions with shock flashing through their pupils. Mo Yan squinted his eyes and asked, “Who are you?”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He didn’t believe that someone like Lin Yun was a nobody. But Lin Yun waved his hand and removed his hood, revealing his appearance. At the same time, his hood flew out and cut the two Blazeyang Realm’s elites into two before they could land on the ground, cutting down their lives like weeds.

Reaching out, Lin Yun grabbed onto the hood and smiled, “Lin Yun. Flower Burial Lin Yun.”
