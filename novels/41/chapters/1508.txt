Chapter 1509 - Rotten Heart

Lin Yun glanced at Ding Lei. But just when he was about to speak, a voice resounded, “It shouldn’t be a spatial crack because the aura coming from it was extremely evil. It makes me feel like a demonic beast is hidden in the void.”

Huang Kun, who was one of the five body-refining cultivators, spoke. He appeared to be a middle-aged man in his fifties, but his vitality was terrifying, and the grey floral runes on his skin were striking.

The old man, Chen Xiuhai, continued, “It’s a little weird. So as long as you don’t run around recklessly, you should be able to sense it beforehand and avoid it.”

“It doesn't look like a spatial vortex. If that’s a spatial vortex, then there should be cracks.” Lin Yun added.

“It’s surprising that you’re a body-refining cultivator.” Jin Ao, the last one amongst the five, spoke. When his gaze fell on Lin Yun, he continued, “I wonder what body-refining technique you cultivated? We can discuss it more…”

“It’s just an ordinary technique.There’s no way it can be compared to you guys. I’m a swordsman… let’s not be distracted here.” Lin Yun ignored Jin Ao and continued forth.

“Haha.” Jin Ao smiled with his gaze becoming sinister.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Chen Xiuhai quickly followed Lin Yun and whispered, “Jin Ao is a subordinate of the first envoy, and he’s also here to supervise us. So he was trying to find more information about you earlier, so you should be careful.”

Lin Yun stopped, and he knew why Jin Ao’s gaze was filled with malice when they had no grudges against each other. When he looked at Chen Xiuhai again, he noticed that Chen Xiuhai had become indifferent and had no intention of bothering him.

But he soon figured it out. Aside from Ding Lei, everyone knew that it wasn’t an easy task for them to deal with the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses.

Maintaining his composure, Lin Yun looked ahead and transmitted his voice to Chen Xiuhai, “Mister, you’ve already reached the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, right? Why haven’t you made a breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm?”

Chen Xiuhai’s gaze was directed elsewhere as he replied, “I can’t be compared to you. I only reached the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm over time. With my aptitude, the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm is my limit, and I might not even be able to condense my dragon origin. Now that I’m getting on in age, I’m not really bothered with reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm anymore, and I’m also not running out of lifespan anytime soon.

“Why do you think I’m here? I have about ten years left, so I have to make a breakthrough sooner or later. My aptitude is limited, and it’s pointless even if I make a breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm now. Who doesn’t want to be a king? I can only put my hopes on saint elixirs that can improve my aptitude or try to obtain a Divine Dragon Bone…” Chen Xiuhai continued, but he soon shut his mouth because he knew he had revealed too much.

“I also want to obtain a Divine Dragon Bone, if there’s a chance.” Lin Yun smiled.

“The Divine Dragon Bone is too heaven-defying. I can only say that it will be dug out of you even if you obtained it if you don’t have a saint backing you up. I’m satisfied if I can get a saint elixir to improve my aptitude.”

“Mister, how old are you?”

“Three hundred-plus. Don’t find it strange because body-refining cultivators generally have a longer lifespan than others…”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned, and Chen Xiuhai’s words had impacted him significantly. He couldn’t imagine himself being stuck at the Elysium Core Realm at three hundred years old and still having to risk his life to search for a saint elixir. If he had been in Chen Xiuhai’s position, he might not have had the courage to refine a Divine Dragon Bone even if he obtained one.

He had a master and a sect master who was willing to give him the Divine Golden Crow Iron. So he couldn’t comprehend the world that the old man was in, and this was the norm in the world—this world where the strong preyed on the weak was much more terrifying.

The envoys ranked in the top five were strong, and they dealt with many demonic beasts as they cleared the way in the front, especially Tian Jue, who displayed terrifying strength. The latter was proficient in lightning intent, reaching the fourth grade, and he was also decisive when he made his move. Lightning would condense into a blade; anyone could guess he had also cultivated the blade intent.

The four other envoys had trouble facing those demonic beasts, but Tian Jue only had to wave his hand to cut those demonic beasts into two. He left the designated region several times, and this proved that he was familiar with the environment.

With them clearing the path, everyone else had nothing to do. But they could feel a pair of eyes directed at them, making them feel uneasy. But when they turned back, they realized that the gaze had come from Jin Ao.

Four hours later, the group ran into somewhat troublesome demonic beasts. This time, they saw Tian Jue making a move for real since he finally drew his blade. It was a long slender blade with lightning flickering on it. The moment he drew his blade, ten-odd demonic beasts were severed into two.

Once he sheathed his blade, only then did everyone come to their senses, and they still had shock on their faces.

“That’s a good blade.” Lin Yun casually commented while looking at Tian Jiu’s blade. It was a myriad rune saint artifact and wasn’t at all inferior to Xie Feng’s Star Devourer.

“That’s the Heavenly Feather Blade, a replica of a glory saint artifact.” Chen Xiuhai explained beside Lin Yun.

After killing all the demonic beasts, Tian Jiu wore a grave expression, and the four other envoys had fear on their faces. What stood before them was a huge patch of grey fog, and not even the envoys ranked in the top five dared to make a move, as if they had previously suffered here.

“The five of you come forth.” Tian Jiu said without turning around, but everyone knew his words were directed at the five body-refining cultivators.

This instantly made Ding Lei and others nervous. Ding Lei asked, “To deal with the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses? You haven’t told us how to deal with them.”

“Why do you have so many questions? Just do as you guys are told. Don’t forget that you guys are wearing an entire set of saint armor!” The second envoy barked as he swept his gaze at Ding Lei.

“Let’s go.” Jin Ao shoved Ding Lei before the latter unwillingly entered with Huang Kun and Chen Xiuhai following behind him.

“Your turn.” Jin Ao looked at Lin Yun with a smile.

But Lin Yun didn’t move because he wasn’t a fool. He knew that there was no way body-refining cultivators could deal with the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses. So if Tian Jue wasn’t willing to reveal his method, he definitely wouldn’t take the risk.

A cold light flashed across Jin Ao’s eyes because Lin Yun was starting to get on his nerves, especially since he had a relationship with An Liuyan. He instantly became furious when he saw Lin Yun wasn’t moving.

“Quite the temper you have there.” Jin Ao squinted his eyes with a smile. After he donned the Flame Dragon Saint Armor, his fingers were like dragon claws that landed on Lin Yun’s shoulder.

He put force in his fingers, wanting to make Lin Yun suffer a little. But to his shock, he discovered that he couldn’t even move Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun’s gaze fell on him, he could feel a chill rising from his spine. Lin Yun’s indifferent voice resounded, “Let go.”

The corner of Jin Ao’s lips twitched, and he unconsciously removed his grasp from Lin Yun’s shoulder. But when he let go, he immediately felt something wasn’t right. This guy was at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. So why did he have to be afraid of Lin Yun?

Realizing that he was intimidated by a six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, Jin Ao became embarrassed and furious as he reached out, wanting to grab onto Lin Yun’s shoulder again, “Who the hell do you think you are? How dare you order me!”

But Lin Yun suddenly disappeared in the next second, causing Jin Ao to grab onto nothing. When Jin Ao came to his senses, Lin Yun was already behind him. When Jin Ao turned around, a hand reached over and grabbed onto his throat, before lifting him off the ground.

This abrupt change of situation instantly alarmed everyone from the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. Even An Liuyan covered her mouth with shock because everyone here was from the Heavenly Astral Pavilion.

The envoys ranked in the top five all had a nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm subordinates, and the consequences of Lin Yun making a move here would be dire.

Several killing intents locked onto Lin Yun, and at least four of the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts coldly looked at Lin Yun. But Tian Jue waved his hand, signaling them not to make a move.

After Lin Yun casually tossed Jin Ao aside, the second envoy standing beside Tian Jue coldly said with a cold light shining in his pupils, “Are you trying to revolt?”

“I just want to know how body-refining cultivators are supposed to deal with the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses.” Lin Yun calmly asked.

The four envoys beside Tian Jue instantly became furious, but Tian Jue kept his composure with a cold light flashing through his pupils. He snickered, “I thought you were a smart person, but it turns out that you’re also a fool. Since you’ve already guessed it, why are you still asking me about it?”

Lin Yun held a slight hope for him because he didn’t want to flip the table if he could. But Tian Jue had treated his goodwill as foolish, but he also didn’t seem wrong. After all, they were all demonic cultivators, and An Liuyan was just an exception.

“Give him the saint armor!” Tian Jue said indifferently.

As Jin Ao struggled back on his feet, he removed another set of Flame Dragon Saint Armor from his interspatial pouch. This changed the faces of Ding Lei and others because even a fool could tell that there was a problem with the saint armor.

“Tian Jue, what are you trying to do?” An Liuyan and Xiao Yun came forth with cold faces.

“Why don’t you ask yourself that question? I’m the first envoy, and I’m not obliged to explain to a mere thirteenth ranked envoy like you. Do you think that I’m too much? Do you think any of them are fools? Which of them doesn’t have a plan of their own amongst them? I don’t mind as long as they can beat me. Otherwise, they can only obediently shut their mouths.” Tian Jue said as he raised his eyes. He was domineering, and no one dared to look him in the eyes.

An Liuyan was also intimidated to the point that she didn’t dare to say a word.

“What’s wrong? You feel that he’s wronged?” Tian Jue’s gaze turned cold. “If he has no thoughts on the Divine Dragon Bone, why did he come into the Dragon Burial Valley with us? The Dragon Burial Valley is filled with danger. Do you think he can come this far by himself if he doesn’t follow me? Since you dare to play the game, you must accept it if you’re not strong enough. Otherwise, get lost!”

Lin Yun now had a whole new impression of demonic cultivators, one who speculated others with malice right from the start. In the end, he didn’t say a word and put on the Flame Dragon Saint Armor.

This scene satisfied Tian Jue, and he snickered, “Looks like you’re not entirely stupid. You have a good evaluation of your strength.”

An Liuyan still wanted to say something, but Xiao Yun stopped her. Xiao Yun was filled with contempt in his heart after he watched this scene. In his view, Tian Jue was too short-sighted, thinking he could control the entire situation.

But he had no idea that he had completely lost the chance to make up with Lin Yun. At least Xiao Yun didn’t think anyone could stop Lin Yun if the latter wanted to leave. But not only was Tian Jue foolish, he was also rotten to the core, wanting to use body-refining cultivators as bait. He even brought out the twisted logic that everyone in the world was as rotten as him.

“This person’s origin isn’t simple, and his sword intent is a little strong.” The second envoy whispered to Tian Jue after seeing the five entering the grey fog.

“So what? He can only obediently enter the grey fog in the end. He’s simply courting death to dare to challenge Big Brother Tian Jue.” The third envoy said with disdain.

“They’re here.” Tian Jue said indifferently. After the five entered the grey fog, pairs of crimson eyes began to appear, which meant that the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses were here.
