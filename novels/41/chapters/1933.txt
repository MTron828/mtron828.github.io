Chapter 1934 - Sword Of The Beginning (1)

But before the four could respond, they threw another mouthful of blood, and getting back on their feet was tough. It was clear that the four could no longer put up a fight.

Only Wang Muyan, Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Lin Beitong remained. The four unleashed their nirvana auras to defend the incoming sword intent. But even so, they had shock on their faces and fear in their pupils.

As for Wang Yue, who had just gotten down the stage, he was completely dumbfounded with his mouth wide open. It turned out that Ye Qingtuian didn’t use his full strength earlier. His mind became blank when he looked at Ye Qingtian.

Everyone in the surrounding area was also shocked, and they were dumbfounded. After all, Ye Qingtian was too cocky and even claimed he wanted to fight everyone simultaneously. Everyone might’ve think he was boasting if he didn’t release his sword intent. But after witnessing Ye Qingtian’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at complete mastery, their hearts trembled because they knew that Ye Qingtian was serious about what he said.

“Oh, my god. Ye Qingtian is really going to soar to the sky.”

“So his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent has already reached complete mastery, and he’s no longer hiding it.”

“It’s no wonder why he dares to join the Di Group. So it turns out that he’s confident about the outcome.” An uproar broke out from the surroundings, and the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples could feel their blood boiling within their bodies.

On the Heavenly Dao Altar, the Saint Elders looked at Ye Qingtian with disbelief, and even they were affected by Lin Yun’s words.

“‘Youths like us should be arrogant, and I wish to slay heaven’…Even a saint might not be so arrogant.”

“Ye Qingtian’s future is unprecedented.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint stroked his beard and smiled, “I already said that the Di Group’s champion is easily within Ye Qingtian’s reach!”

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign was shocked by this scene, and he wanted to mock Ye Qingtian by habit. But recalling the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s gaze earlier, he immediately swallowed his words.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, “He has quite the temper, and he’ll probably suffer badly if he loses.”

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign inwardly nodded, and he smiled, “Martial Aunt Heavenly Jade is right.”

“We’ll see, then!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint snorted. He wasn’t confident about it and could only put on a strong front. Even his disciple was so cocky, and he couldn’t be inferior to his disciple. He could only hope that Ye Qingtian wouldn’t make him embarrassed before the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

Upon sensing Lin Yun’s powerful sword intent, side from Wang Muyan, the faces of the three changed.

“Who the hell do you think you are? You want to slay heaven?” Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan exchanged glances before appearing on the stage. They were ten feet away from Lin Yun. They released their auras at the Nirvana Stage's fourth transformation and summoned their constellations.

Zhang Yue’s constellation was a golden sea of flames, while Ye Feifan’s was nine saint swords. Lin Yun’s sword intent was forced back when they summoned their constellations.

When Lin Beitong saw this scene, he squinted his eyes with a chill flashing across his pupils. Wang Muyan wore a smile because Ye Qingtian would be in trouble if this was the extent of his strength.

“Do you think you’re invincible with your Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at complete mastery?” Zhang Yue sneered and activated his Flame Yang Saint Physique with golden flames gushing out from his body.

Ye Feifan also smiled, “It’s time to teach him a lesson, or he’ll think we’re garbage.”

Everyone in the surroundings was alarmed because Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan’s cultivations at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage were terrifying.

Ye Feifan also released his martial intent, his pinnacle fifth-grade Lightning Intent. As Ye Feifan’s Lightning Intent mergec with his Sword Intent, lightning bolts begin to flicker and crackle on the stage, and the vibration of the sword accompanied each lightning bolt. They gave off the feeling that Ye Feifan could confront Ye Qingtian’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent by himself.

When Ye Feifan and Zhang Yue’s auras combined, they forced back Ye Qingtian’s sword intent. This made everyone take a deep breath because, in their eyes, it was practically impossible for Ye Qingtian to face multiple enemies. Neither Ye Feifan nor Zhang Yue were pushovers.

Right then, a powerful gale rose as a figure appeared beside Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan. Lin Beitong didn’t hesitate to come onto the stage, seeing that Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan managed to suppress Ye Qingtian.

“Hahaha! Ye Qingtian, you’re too cocky!” Lin Beitong summoned his constellation and released his martial intent when he came on the stage. The three joined forces, and fine cracks appeared on Ye Qingtian’s sword aura.

Hearing the crackling sounds made everyone’s faces change.

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign smiled when he saw this scene, “It looks like Ye Qingtian is in a dire situation. Not to mention that the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden has yet to make her move.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint glared at the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign, causing the latter to shut up. But the smile on the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign’s face became denser.

Judging from the face-off of aura alone, anyone could tell that Ye Qingtian was in a dire situation.

“Ye Qingtian, you can still admit defeat now. Otherwise, I will return the humiliation you gave me ten-fold!” Ye Feifan gritted his teeth, looking at Ye Qingtian. He naturally meant how Ye Qingtian humiliated him with the identity of a Great Saint’s direct disciple.

“Why do I have to admit defeat?” Lin Yun smiled and turned to look at Wang Muyan, “Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, you can come up as well.”

But Wang Muyan grumbled with a smile, “Junior Brother Ye, you really know how to joke. How can I possibly join hands with others to deal with you?”

Her words immediately caused an uproar as everyone looked at Ye Qingtian with jealousy and hatred. After all, that was the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, and she had publicly expressed her love for Ye Qingtian. Even if Ye Qingtian lost, it was already worth it.

But Lin Yun merely rolled his eyes because he noticed her pupils' smugness. On the contrary, the faces of Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Lin Beitong were pale.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Don’t let him admit defeat so easily!” Zhang Yue said, and he charged towards Lin Yun with Ye Feifan and Lin Beitong following behind him.
