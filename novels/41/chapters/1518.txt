Chapter 1519 - I'm More Interested In You!

Lin Yun was exhausted on the ninth level of the Blue Dragon Trial Tower after making it through the trial. The trial on the ninth level was more challenging than he imagined. Even with his quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, it wasn’t easy. In this trial, he suffered a massive loss due to his cultivation.

His opponent was someone at the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, grasping the Firmament Sword Intent at complete mastery. The sword intent released by him was too terrifying. With the multiplication of astral energy reaching nine folds and complete mastery of Firmament Sword Intent, he was easily suppressed.

But fortunately, it was just a trial, and it wasn’t a real opponent. Otherwise, he wasn’t sure if he could live to defeat his opponent.

If there was no exception, it shouldn’t be easy for the other chief disciples to make it through the trial, and only Ling Qianye and Murong Chen could make it through. This was because they were both at the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, which meant that they didn’t have a disadvantage in their cultivation, not to mention that they received lots of benefits after coming to the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, and they had probably reached the pinnacle of the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

“Should I refine the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet here…?” Lin Yun pondered. The ninth level was crucial because he was practically convinced that the Blue Dragon Bone could be found here, and his vitality could already sense it. Regardless of Ling Qianye or Murong Chen, they weren’t on the same level as the other chief disciples.

One came from the Blood Moon Sect, and the other had a high chance of becoming a holy son of the Imperial Demon Domain. Although it would definitely be a huge waste if he refined the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet at the Elysium Core Realm, he didn’t have much choice.

His battle with Tian Jue wasn’t easy, and he had to face Ling Qianye and Murong Chen. He could predict that he would have to be in a ferocious battle after obtaining the Divine Dragon Bone.

“There’s no other choice.” A decisive light flashed through Lin Yun’s pupils. He wasn’t someone who would doubt himself, and he immediately swallowed the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet.

When he swallowed the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet, his astral energy began to fluctuate within his body, and his cultivation was rapidly rising. This was simply too unbelievable because his astral energy ocean blazed, and a golden aura began to be emitted from his pores.

Under the refinement of the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet, his astral energy became purer. His cultivation had reached the pinnacle seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm in the blink of an eye, with over a hundred golden dragons raging within his body. All of his meridians have reached a bottleneck. It felt as if they would shatter in the next moment. After all, the tyranny of the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet was too unreasonable.

Not only his astral origin but even his internal organs were transforming under the refinement. No words could explain the tyranny of the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet. Not a single saint fruit nor saint elixir that he had refined in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm could be compared to this.

For a moment, Lin Yun understood why Tian Jue had lost his composure when he saw the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet. As a hundred dragons raged within his body, Lin Yun’s cultivation began to rise, along with his dragon runes and Golden Crow Wings. The Golden Crow Wings uncontrollably burst out from his back, and the saint runes on them began to light up.

It was comfortable, since all the saint fruits and saint elixirs he consumed in the past were all accompanied by pain. But refining the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet felt unbelievably comfortable. All the hidden injuries that had accumulated within his body and the impurities of the treasures he had refined so far were all cleansed.

This surprised Lin Yun because he never expected that so many impurities would be accumulated in his body. If he didn’t get rid of them, it would be a massive threat to him sooner or later. That wasn’t surprising because he had refined ten-odd saint fruits and countless saint elixirs while in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.

He had refined too many treasures in quick succession and consumed one saint fruit after another before his body could fully absorb the previous ones. So this meant that there would be impurities accumulating within his body. He initially thought it was a waste for him to refine the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet right then, but now it was a fortune in disguise because it had cleansed the impurities within his body.

He was now like a jade that was being cleansed of the accumulated impurities by the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet. In the end, Lin Yun practically lost control of his cultivation and smoothly reached the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. His skin was as smooth as a baby’s, and his internal organs shone brightly.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his pupils were pure, and there were no impurities. When Lin Yun let out a breath, it felt like he had undergone a drastic transformation. At the same time, the number of his dragon runes finally reached ten thousand. This meant that his Azure Dragon Saint Art had reached complete mastery, and he only needed a Divine Dragon Bone now.

Retracting the Golden Crow Wings back into his body, Lin Yun muttered, “Time to refine the Divine Dragon Bone!”

Now that he had reached the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, his astral energy had been refined, his astral energy ocean reaching 35,000 feet, dragon runes reaching ten thousand, the Golden Crow Wings that possesses a saint rune, along with the quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent and Earth Sword Form that he had never revealed.

Lin Yun was now confident in facing any opponent. His sword would prove who was the strongest and the most suitable owner of the Divine Dragon Bone. He wouldn’t hesitate to slay anyone who dared to stand in his way, and he was determined to obtain the Blue Dragon Bone.

Along with powerful fighting spirits, Lin Yun pressed on and followed the aura of the Divine Dragon Bone.

Half an hour later, Lin Yun could sense that the Divine Dragon Bone was close, and he finally came into the hall. When a blue stage appeared, his gaze immediately locked onto the box. The box still had restrictions, but Lin Yun already knew what was in it.

The dragon runes within his body would’ve already flown out if he didn’t forcibly suppress them. This was a weird feeling because it felt like the dragon runes were connected with bloodlines. It felt as if he was supposed to be here.

But just when Lin Yun wanted to approach it, a chilling aura suddenly swept over as a dark light containing nether energy flashed. Lin Yun took three steps back to avoid this attack, and he was soon surprised because he naturally recognized the nether energy.

He already guessed who it was and couldn’t think of anyone besides Murong Chen, the one amongst the seven chief disciples who possessed nether energy. Before he could regain his footing, a black figure stepped out from the darkness and charged over with a torrential deathly aura.

Under the corrosion of nether energy, Lin Yun’s sword intent was heavily corroded and showed signs of collapsing. If it was someone normal, their vitality would’ve been corroded under this attack. But Lin Yun was calm and circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. A twelve-petaled Netherflower then appeared.

When the nether energy filled his body and fused with his astral energy, Lin Yun threw a punch out. Throwing his punch forth, his sword intent that was previously corroded immediately came back to life. When the punch of nether energy dispersed, the person who unleashed the previous attack took several steps back.

He raised his head to look at the person and it was whom he had guessed. It was Murong Chen who unleashed that attack. He soon lowered his head to look at the interspatial bracelet on Murong Chen’s wrist. He could sense an aura that made the Netherflower condensed by his Divine Firmament Sword Sutra nearly spiral out of control.

“Lin Tian? That should be your name, right? The Blue Dragon Bone belongs to me!” Murong Chen didn’t bother concealing his objective, and his speech was arrogant. As someone who could compete to become a holy son, he had the qualifications to be arrogant, regardless of who he faced.

“Let you have it?” Lin Yun snickered with mockery flashing across his pupils. It took him a great amount of effort to come this far, and Murong Chen wanted him to give the Blue Dragon Bone away? What a laughable joke.

“Lin Tian should be your fake name, right?” Murong Chen squinted his eyes as he wore a playful smile. “You should’ve obtained a lot of treasures along the way, right? You don’t have a demonic sect behind you; you’re merely a guest of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. You should know that it’s a crime to be in possession of treasures without the capability or background to keep them, right? You’re already a dead man because the elders of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion won’t let you off.”

“I don’t need you to worry about that.” Lin Yun replied.

“Ha!” Murong Chen wasn’t bothered and snickered, “I only want to point out a path for you. Cooperate with me. I’ll ensure you can leave with the treasures you have obtained so far. When I fight Ling Qianye later, you only have to stand beside me. I don’t need any of his treasures, and I can swear in the name of the Heavenly Demon Emperor if you don’t believe me.”

He was serious about what he said this time. After all, the fact that Lin Yun could reach the ninth level was enough to prove that he wasn’t weak. If Lin Yun was willing to cooperate with him, he was confidently sure that he could obtain the Blue Dragon Bone, and Murong Chen also knew that the seven demonic sects would let Lin Yun off.

Even if Lin Yun could obtain the Blue Dragon Bone, how would he leave? So he didn’t think Lin Yun had any other choice and was also confident that Lin Yun wouldn’t refuse him.

“Ling Qianye’s treasures will belong to me?” Lin Yun asked in an interested tone.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“That’s for sure.” Murong Chen smiled in a confident tone. “I only need the Divine Dragon Bone. I don’t need Ling Qianye’s saint elixirs or saint fruits. You should know the strength of my Netherworld Hall. No one will dare to stop you when you and I leave this astral realm!”

“Compared to Ling Qianye’s treasures, I’m more interested in your treasures!” Lin Yun smiled. When he said that, Murong Chen’s face drastically changed.
