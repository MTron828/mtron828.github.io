Chapter 896 - Only One Sword is Needed to Kill

Lin Yun travelled at a decent speed and quickly arrived in front of Flamefeather City. When he got close, he realized that the massive city was a lot more damaged than he previously thought.

Parts of the buildings had been submerged in the sand, which made the city look barren. When he stepped into the city, he noticed that the surrounding temperature had dropped violently. The fire energy didn’t really dissipate, but had fused into the air. It would enter the body through breathing and it could even sneak its way in through the pores.

Focusing his sword energy into his eyes, Lin Yun noticed that there were many black sparks in the air that couldn’t be seen to the naked eye. Not even his sword intent could get rid of them. Those black sparks weren’t lethal, but they would become terrifying after accumulating to a certain extent.

“I see…” Lin Yun dissipated the sword intent in his pupils. Those who came to Flamefeather City earlier probably didn’t notice it. One couldn’t stay for long or else the black sparks would gather into terrifying fire poison. After infiltrating the internal organs, they would incinerate the body from within. But it wouldn’t cause harm if one didn’t stay for long.

Lin Yun quickly started traveling through the city after he figured this out. Although he wasn’t moving as fast as possibe, he still caught up to the geniuses that left before him.

It was just as Lin Yun had speculated. Everyone had split up because of how massive the ruins were, so it wouldn’t be easy for everyone to gather. Then again, this was beneficial to him.

Travelling through the ruins, Lin Yun would occasionally find people anxiously searching. Those people had underestimated the damage to Flamefeather City and were frantically trying to find treasures. Most of the buildings were submerged in sand, which made the treasures and inheritances hard to find.

Roughly four hours later, Lin Yun came to a stop and narrowed his eyes. He could see a small tree blooming in the sand that emitted a faint golden luster. At the top of the tree were white flames that hovered over a blooming flower. It was the Gold Flowlight Lamp.

Lin Yun initially thought it would take him a whole day to find, so he never expected to find it in less than half a day. The Gold Flowlight Lamp was classified by the colors white, blue, purple, and gold. The one before Lin Yun was an ordinary one, but it was still a good sign.

Without hesitation, Lin Yun poured his origin energy into his hands and waved them. In the next second, the tree was uprooted and flew into his hand. But before he could examine it, the sand covered ground exploded as a gigantic python with black scales appeared. The python was emitting an aura in the pinnacle Heavenly Soul Realm.

The python had died, but under the nourishment of unknown energy, it had come back to life with a strong attachment to the Gold Flowlight Lamp. In the next second, the python charged at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun stored the Gold Flowlight Lamp and calmly retreated. When he executed the Cloudsoaring Art, a dragon aura surged beneath his feet that helped him dodge the python.

When the python charged again, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. He had already put the Gold Flowlight Lamp away, but the python insisted on bothering him. Losing his patience, Lin Yun sent the python flying. But when the python landed on the ground, it got back up and dashed forward once again.

“How troublesome!” Lin Yun locked his brows together because he was annoyed with the python. Without hesitation, hundreds of dragon runes poured into his right arm as 300 cauldrons worth of strength exploded out.

Lin Yun empowered the punch with his sword intent, so the python instantly crumpled to the ground. However, the python continued to squirm on the ground even after it was dead.

“Weakk.” Lin Yun looked at the corpse casually before he continued his journey. He purposefully avoided the crowds and soely focused on gather Gold Flowlight Lamps.

In the blink of an eye, two days had passed. Over the course of two days, he had obtained three white Gold Flowlight Lamps and four blue Gold Flowlight Lamps. He placed each flower into the sword box as soon as he found them. He could clearly sense the Flower Burial Sword was improving as it basked under the floral aroma. At the same time, the demonic beasts he ran into also became stronger. He even faced the assault of four pythons at once.

“What dense flower fragrance!” Lin Yun stopped on a tattered roof with surprise flashing in his eyes. He could smell the flower fragrance from the Gold Flowlight Lamp and had never encountered one with such a dense flower fragrance. Could it be a purple Gold Flowlight Lamp?

With a shudder in his heart, Lin Yun followed the direction of the flower fragrance. When he got closer, he was shocked to discover that the fragrance was intoxicating like alcohol. The Gold Flowlight Lamp he was trying to find was anything but simple.

When he came to a stop, he saw a Gold Flowlight Lamp with ten gold petals. Under the sunlight, the gold flower emitted a bewitching luster. The flower bud was red, which made the combination of red and gold look even more dreamy.

Lin Yun had discovered a Gold Flowlight Lamp of the highest grade. But…

“Hehe. Another one that’s courting death.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“The temptation of this flower isn’t small. We just have to continue camping here to wait for people to come to us.”

“Compared to the Gold Flowlight Lamp, the treasures on people are more valuable!”

“So it’s a piece of trash that isn’t even in the Heavenly Soul Realm!” The four people who were camping near the Gold Flowlight Lamp were surrounded by ten corpses on the ground. All four were from intermediate realms and had tribulation qualifications. When they examined Lin Yun, their pupils were filled with mockery.

“Since you’re here, don’t you dare leave!” The leader laughed as he charged towards Lin Yun while remaining three blocked Lin Yun’s paths of retreat. The four of them must have been working together for a long time.

“You guys are courting death!” Lin Yun used his fingers as his sword and stabbed his opponent’s forehead with an azure sword ray. This caught his opponent by surprise as he was sent flying.

“Sword intent! This brat had grasped the spiritual sword intent! Move together!” The remaining three shouted as they charged together.

“How pitiful.” Lin Yun began to move, leaving afterimages that attacked his enemies with each step. Before the remaining three could even get close to him, their heads had already hit the ground.

By the time Lin Yun’s afterimages overlapped with his main body, four corpses hit the ground. Not even a first soul Heavenly Soul Realm genius could pose a threat to him now, let alone normal Heavenly Soul Realms.

Lin Yun didn’t immediately take the Gold Flowlight Lamp. He wasn’t in a hurry to take it because it hadn’t matured yet. He needed to wait for the crimson light in the bud to condense into a droplet of blood that dripped onto the petals. Only then would it be ready for harvest. A Gold Flowlight Lamp of this degree was a rare treasure, so Lin Yun naturally had to wait for it to fully mature. Otherwise, he would be wasting the treasure.

To pass the time, Lin Yun found a place to sit down and started meditating. An hour later, a crimson droplet finally fell on the petals and started burning. Simultaneously, Lin Yun opened his eyes. However, he opened his eyes because someone was approaching.

This person was donned in grey clothes and emitted cold killing intent. The person was only slightly weaker than Chen Xuan. After all, those who could get through the tribulation weren't pushovers.

“They were all killed by you? It’s really impressive to have such strength in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. You can get lost now.” The grey-clothed youth spoke with pride written all over his face.

Lin Yun might have feared the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses before entering Thunderflame City, but he had the Three Heavenly Divides now. His strength had undergone a drastic transformation. Plus, he used the Demonic Soul Fruit to refine his origin energy and physique. With his current strength, he no longer worried about the first soul.

“You’re still not enough,” said Lin Yun who showed no intention of leaving.

The grey-clothed youth grinned before he shook his head, “There are a lot of arrogant people in the Heavenly Path who think that they’re unparalleled geniuses. It’s a pity you have no idea how terrifying someone in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm is. My advice to you is to leave or else you won’t even have time to feel regret.”

“Why would I feel regret when I can just kill you?” Lin Yun opened his sword box. When it opened, countless petals of white, blue, and purple flew in the sky with flames. Then, a silhouette flew out of the box and into Lin Yun’s palm. It was naturally the Flower Burial Sword.

“How stubborn!” The grey-clothed youth finally lost his temper. The origin energy in his aura ocean and violet palace started to boil. But before he could even react, Lin Yun had already drawn his sword.

In the next second, clouds of mist started filling every corner of the region. The mist caused the grey-clothed youth’s face to change as he quickly raised his guard. However, the mist left just as quickly as it arrived. Before the grey-clothed youth could even respond, a sword had pierced his forehead without him noticing.

“Cut the act!” The grey-clothed youth cursed after discovering he was fine. Seeing Lin Yun sheath his sword, he sneered, “The execution is just about to start. You won’t even have time to escape when I make my move.”

“I only needed one sword to kill you. You’re already dead,” said Lin Yun while looking at the person before him calmly. When he was done talking, the sword in the grey-clothed youth’s head exploded.

Just like that, another headless corpse fell to the ground. At the same time, the Gold Flowlight Lamp had fully matured. With a wave of his hand, the flower flew into Lin Yun’s grasp as the flower’s radiance lit up his face.

Many cultivators hidden in the surroundings had fear on their faces when they saw this scene. Evidently, they were terrified after seeing Lin Yun kill a first soul Heavenly Soul Realm genius with only one sword.
