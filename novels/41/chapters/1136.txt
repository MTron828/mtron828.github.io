Chapter 1137 - Returning To The Sect

After leaving the Demon Domain, Lin Yun rested for two days before heading back to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Lil’ Purple also had a lot of fun outside, which delayed their return even more. After killing Thunderclap Sword Demon, Lin Yun had taken care of everyone on the scroll.

After two months of running around, he was finally done. So he didn’t mind relaxing a bit. They ended up relaxing for half a month before they returned to the sect.

“I’m back!” Looking at the mountains enveloped in the massive array, Lin Yun sucked in a cold breath. After being gone for so long, he felt like he was returning home. He wasn’t wearing the mask as he didn’t want to attract unwanted attention. Plus, he was more fond of his identity as Lin Yun than the silver-haired Flower Burial.

In the past two months, everyone in the Profound Azure Prefecture knew about Flower Burial. However, no one knew that the true identity of Flower Burial was Lin Yun.

Lin Yun leisurely thought about all the progress that he made along his journey and thought about his sword intent that had reached its bottleneck. He knew that it would be earth-shattering if he managed to make the breakthrough. Otherwise, he would be restricted in a prison he had created for himself. He would suffer a huge loss if he fought empyreans all because he was holding off on his breakthrough.

Suddenly, Lin Yun smiled because he recalled someone still owed him a pot of Millennium Flame. Looking at his smile, Lil’ Purple said, “Hmph, why does your smile look so lewd? What are you thinking about? You can’t think about other girls because I’m watching you on behalf of Yue Weiwei.”

Lin Yun smiled and didn’t bother to argue with her. Lil’ Purple seemed to have a great impression of Yue Weiwei and would glance at Lin Yun in disdain occasionally, “What’s bad about Yue Weiwei? This empress likes someone like her, someone who dares to love and hate openly. Not to mention that she even gave you the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute.”

“Don’t get involved in the affairs of adults.” Lin Yun knocked her on the head and then continued forward. Just like that, the two returned to the sword sect and back to their residence.

Suddenly, a voice sounded out in Lin Yun’s ears, “Come and meet me.”

Seeing that the old geezer was so anxious, Lin Yun muttered inwardly before he soared into the sky and flew towards the main palace. His trip had been dangerous, especially because he drew the attention of an old monster in the Dragon Pulse Realm and nearly lost his life. So Lin Yun wondered if he should ask for more True Dragon Saint Liquid.

Soon, Lin Yun arrived at the main hall and met with the sect master once more. The sect master was still wearing gray clothes that matched his long hair and beard. He emitted a deep and unfathomable aura as his sword intent felt like a deep abyss.

When he saw Lin Yun, he smiled, “I heard that Thunderclap Sword Demon was killed in the Heavenly Star Pavilion. I bet you failed to complete the list, right? Like I said that there won’t be any True Dragon Saint Liquid for you if one person is missing.”

Lin Yun didn’t say a word and merely took out Thunderclap Sword Demon’s decapitated head. Seeing this, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s sect master was surprised, “You’re Flower Burial?”

“Carry on with your act,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Hahaha!” The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s sect master laughed. “I’m not acting. Although I had an idea, I never would have guessed that you had a strong attainment in music dao.”

“Cut it out. Have you prepared the True Dragon Saint Liquid?” Lin Yun asked with his arm outstretched.

“This is a total of 135 droplets. Use them sparingly,” said the sect master as he took out the True Dragon Saint Liquid. Then, he took the decapitated head.

When Lin Yun saw the True Dragon Saint Liquid before him, his eyes flashed with joy because this was an astronomical sum. He knew that this was a large sum for any genius in Kunlun Realm. Honestly speaking, Lin Yun knew that it was impossible for him to get this much just by killing some demonic cultivators.

He definitely knew that the old geezer had other plans, but the True Dragon Saint Liquid was too important to Lin Yun for him to care. Receiving the True Dragon Saint Liquid, Lin Yun cupped his hands together, “Thank you.”

“No need to thank me, you also helped me out.” The sect master was briefly stunned by Lin Yun’s politeness before he smiled, “If you feel bad, you can return some to me.”

“Haha, I don’t think so.” Lin Yun smiled with his eyes flickering. Since he already had the True Dragon Saint Liquid, he would never give them back.

“These aren’t even enough for me to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. Old geezer, how many more do you have hidden?” Lin Yun asked. He had the Azure Dragon Saint Art, so he could refine the True Dragon Saint Liquid a lot faster than others. According to his estimation, he would need 200 more.

As long as his Azure Dragon Saint Art reached the sixth stage, he would have confidence to endure the boundless origin energy in the last tribulation. To reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, he needed to have a strong physique. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to deal with the quality of origin energy that he would face.

Lin Yun’s astral energy would far exceed ordinary people the moment he reached the Empyrean Realm. It would be at the level of the Galaxy Stage or even Astral Stage. The quality of astral energy could easily blow a person’s body apart, and from that, one could imagine how tough it was to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm.

“I won’t hide it from you, I don’t have any more. It’s good news for me if you can reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. Anyway, I happen to have something I’ll need your help with,” chuckled the sect master.

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t believe the sect master because the sect master had hidden himself deeply since he was even stronger than Feng Jue. Since Feng Jue could give him a saint artifact, the sect master was definitely very wealthy.

“What do you need help with?” Lin Yun was curious about what the sect master needed from him.

“I’ll tell you about it after you reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. It’ll do more harm than good if I tell you right now. Also, I need you to keep a low profile for the next few months,” said the sect master. It almost sounded like he only called Lin Yun to remind him to stay lowkey.

But even if the sect master didn’t say anything to Lin Yun, he would have kept a low profile. After all, he just created a huge uproar in the Demon Domain. Lin Yun and the sect master kept talking, but the sect master wasn’t taking anything else out for Lin Yun.

“Old geezer, you really don’t have any more True Dragon Saint Liquid? Now that I think about it, I don’t really need to keep a low profile,” said Lin Yun when he was about to leave. Clearly, he wasn’t going to give up.

“Hahaha!” The sect master laughed and seemed a lot younger, giving Lin Yun a misperception that this old man was a young swordsman shining brightly.

“You’re still not giving up? Alright then. I’ll give you some more names after you’re done refining the True Dragon Saint Liquid you have on hand,” said the sect master with a smile.

“Deal!” Lin Yun smiled because he knew that the sect master definitely had more True Dragon Saint Liquid. Not long after he left, Ye Ziling walked in.

“Father, something big took place in the Demon Domain this time.” Ye Ziling had just come back from the Demon Domain, and she still couldn’t forget about what happened in the Heavenly Star Pavilion. As she shared what Flower Burial did, she also began probing her father for information.

“There are rumors that Flower Burial is a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Is that true?” Ye Ziling asked carefully. Truth be told, she didn’t believe those words. But she still felt anticipation for the answer. If Flower Burial was really a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, her father would surely know the identity of Flower Burial.

At the same time, she kept convincing herself that she was only going to thank Flower Burial. After all, the Thunderclap Sword Demon had become a knot in her heart, but Flower Burial resolved it for her. She could also tell that the arrogant Flower Burial was actually lonely from his music.

“Lin Yun just left and he already told me what happened in the Demon Domain,” replied the sect master with a smile.

When Ye Ziling heard that, she couldn’t help feeling disappointed. Since her father didn’t reveal it to her, then this meant that Flower Burial might not be a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Was Lin Yun also in the Demon Domain?

That fellow is only in the seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Although he can fight ordinary Star Stage experts, it’s a little rash of him to head into the Demon Domain. Now that she looked at it, Lin Yun was still as arrogant as before, and in her mind there was no way he could be compared to Flower Burial.

“You seem to hold opinions about Lin Yun?” The sect master smiled.

“I just don’t like how arrogant he is. It would be another matter if he had the strength to back it up. I already know that his achievements will be higher than mine in the future, but it doesn’t change the fact that he’s an arrogant fool right now. To dare to head to the Demon Domain when he’s not an empyrean, what a fool,” replied Ye Ziling. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Hahaha!” The sect master couldn’t help laughing. “Why is Flower Burial allowed to be arrogant, but Lin Yun isn’t? You’re too biased against him…”

Seeing that she was exposed, Ye Ziling blushed before she muttered, “How can you even begin to compare them? The difference in their strength is too huge. I’m not targeting Lin Yun on purpose, I really just don’t like his arrogance.”

“He’s the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path. How can such a genius keep a low profile in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? With his talent and strength, he’s entirely worthy of being arrogant,” smiled the sect master.

When Ye Ziling heard that, her mind blew up. Lin Yun was actually the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path? But how is that possible? Clearly, Ye Ziling couldn’t believe that Lin Yun was the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path.

Thinking that she might have misunderstood him, Ye Ziling became nervous before she refuted, “So what? He’s keeping a young girl around!”

Stroking his beard, the sect master smiled, “If I’m correct, that’s an artifact spirit or a sword spirits. It’s not like what you’re thinking.”

When Ye Ziling heard that, she was completely dumbfounded. If that little girl was really an artifact spirit, then the misunderstanding was huge. Thinking about how she put makeup on Lil’ Purple, she couldn’t help feeling even more embarrassed. She realized that she was the joke all this time.
