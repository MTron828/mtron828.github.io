Chapter 2314 - I Won't Tell You

Three days later, the tempering of Ji Zixi’s physique reached a crucial moment and all the Saints on Divine Phoenix Mountain were gathered together. The summit of this mountain was a little tattered, but it gave off an ancient aura.

There was an altar near the cliff with golden flames blazing, and a blurred figure could be seen in the fire, Ji Zixi. Not far away, the Divine Phoenix Holy Master, Last Sky Great Saint, Astral River Saint Sovereign, and Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign were here, nervously watching her.

Ji Zixi might have the help of the divine flame fragment and wasn’t in danger, but no one dared to be relaxed. The Astral River Saint Sovereign said, “Holy Master, there’s nothing to worry about. Zixi will surely succeed.”

The Last Sky Saint Sovereign smiled, “Zixi is talented and has a dense phoenix bloodline. So it will be smooth. We just have to see if she can produce the Divine Phoenix Wings.”

“I hope so.” The holy master’s expression was loosened, but his fists were clenched.

Right then, the Last Sky Great Saint turned his head, and said, “The Flower Burial Sword Saint is here.”

“Oh?” The holy master’s eyes lit up, and he turned around. He saw an azure-robed swordsman appearing before everyone. He smiled as he came forth, “Lin Yun, you’re finally here.”

Lin Yun nodded and turned to look at Ji Zixi at the altar.

“We pay our greetings to the Heavenly Slaughter Empress!”

““We pay our greetings to the Heavenly Slaughter Empress!””

Before Lin Yun could react, the holy master went down on his knees with everyone else. Many elders descended from the sky and they all went on their knees, leaving Lin Yun dumbfounded.

Lin Yun never expected this scene to occur and didn’t know what would happen. Lil’ Purple’s identity was discovered?

While Lin Yun was doubtful, a burst of radiance came from the Iris Sword Box and Lil’ Purple soared to the sky. She wore the Silvermoon Mask, clad in moonlight, with her hair draping her shoulders. She gave off a powerful pressure that made her look noble.

Lin Yun recalled what Lil’ Purple told him a few days ago, such as that the Sacred Radiance Saint Lord wouldn’t harm him and brought him to the stage with the ashes on it. The holy master probably verified her identity, especially when he displayed Nirvana Dao. This probably made the holy master confirm that he was related to the Iris Sword Saint’s inheritance. For example, the Heavenly Slaughter Empress who appeared outside the God Burial Mountain Range must be the real person.

A hundred thousand years ago, they were followers who came to the Kunlun Realm with Lil’ Purple, and it had been a hundred thousand years since she last appeared.

“It really is the Heavenly Slaughter Empress!”

“We greet Lord Phoenix!”

“We greet Lord Phoenix!”

Lil’ Purple might be wearing a mask, but the aura she gave off, as well as everyone there feeling their blood boiling, had already verified her identity.

“Lord Phoenix! We’ve been waiting for you to return!” Everyone on Divine Phoenix Mountain had tears rolling down their cheeks.

Seeing this, Lin Yun heaved a sigh in relief and stood behind Lil’ Purple. It was best for Lil’ Purple to deal with this herself.

No one knew what Lil’ Purple was thinking, but she muttered after a long time had passed, “All of you can get up.”

When everyone got on their feet, they came before Lil’ Purple, making Lin Yun look like an extra. The holy master emotionally said, “Milord, the entire Divine Phoenix Mountain has waited for your return for the past hundred thousand years.”

Lil’ Purple looked around at how emotional everyone was but didn’t know what to say. A long time later, she said, “It has been tough on all of you, and I’m sorry about that.”

“Please don’t say that. We don’t regret it,” the holy master said.

“Milord!” Many people wanted to come forth to take a closer look at Lil’ Purple.

“Let’s look at her ceremony first.” Lil’ Purple didn’t speak much as she went over to the altar with everyone following behind her, introducing Ji Zixi’s talent in bloodline for her. On the contrary, this made Lin Yun look like an extra, with everyone forgetting him.

“This is interesting,” Lin Yun smiled as he rubbed his nose.

“Flower Burial.” The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign came over with a smile. He asked, “You didn’t expect this, right?”

“I was a little surprised, but not shocked. There were already signs of this beforehand,” Lin Yun said.

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign explained, “They all have that lord’s bloodline, and their bloodline was given by her, which was inherited through the generations.”

“There’s such a secret to the Phoenix Bloodline?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“That’s only something capable of being done by pure-blooded divine beasts. Phoenixes are noble divine beasts that are rare even in the universe,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign smiled. Back then, the Divine Dragon Era was at its prime, luring many divine beasts over. It was a grand era that only occurred in the Kunlun Realm.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts, then asked, “So when the Heavenly Path is reforged, such a grand era will come again?”

“It will,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign said with certainty. “But the risk is also high since we must deal with those rats beneath the God Burial Mountain Range.”

Lin Yun nodded and said nothing else. Right then, golden light burst from the altar, accompanied by a phoenix cry.

Ji Zixi basked in flames as she opened her eyes, giving off a powerful aura. This made her look even more breathtaking with flawless features.

“It’s a success!” Everyone cheered.

“Great!” The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign smiled. “It has been thousands of years since the Divine Phoenix Mountain last produced a Divine Phoenix Physique. This is good news.”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Right then, Lil’ Purple waved her hand and a golden droplet of blood flew into Ji Zixi’s forehead. Golden flames ignited on Ji Zixi once more, surprising Ji Zixi before she closed her eyes. When she reopened her eyes, she spread her arms apart and a pair of flaming wings appeared behind her, releasing a blazing radiance that made Lin Yun and the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign raise their hands before their eyes.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun asked. At this moment, Ji Zixi gave off a powerful aura that was close to a Saint Sovereign.

“It’s the Divine Phoenix Wings. Those who possess it are known as the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, and there aren’t many of them in the universe,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign exclaimed.

When Ji Zixi stowed her wings, she landed before Lil’ Purple and the holy master. Through the holy master’s words, she quickly bowed to Lil’ Purple with excitement and nervousness. When she glanced at Lin Yun from afar, Lin Yun smiled and nodded at her.

This immediately made Ji Zixi forget about everyone here while looking at Lin Yun.

This made the holy master furious, and wanted to reprimand Ji Zixi. But Lil’ Purple smiled, “Let her go.”

“Thank you, Lord Phoenix!” Ji Zixi rejoiced before she ran over to Lin Yun. This naturally made everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain unhappy. How could anyone be so rude to their lord? Many people turned to look at the holy master unhappily, making the latter feel awkward.

“It doesn’t matter. We have something to discuss, and this isn’t the right location.” Lil’ Purple smiled as she winked at Lin Yun before leaving with the holy master.

Lin Yun smiled because Lil’ Purple was still the same person he knew, but the huge commotion earlier really frightened him.

“Big Brother Lin, I’ve finally got to see you! I really missed you a lot!” Ji Zixi smiled with her voice sounding like chimes.

“I’ll take my leave first. You youngsters talk,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign smiled.

“Hehe. Big Brother Lin, let’s go. This place is boring, so let me show you around.” Ji Zixi had a smile on her face as she pulled Lin Yun down the mountain. Lin Yun felt helpless, but he could only follow her and be dragged around.

They passed through the flower valley an hour later, and a lake appeared before them. Lin Yun’s sight opened as he praised, “This place is beautiful.”

“Hehe, right? This is the Mirror Lake. It is rumored that a pair of Azure Birds were buried underneath, and I like this place best,” Ji Zixi chuckled.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned as he thought of the Nirvana Banquet.

“Big Brother Lin, what are you thinking about?” Ji Zixi asked.

“Nothing much. This place made me remember the Three-Lives Tree back in the Nirvana Banquet. There was also a similar lake,” Lin Yun smiled.

“The Nirvana Banquet! I know about it!” Ji Zixi smiled. “That’s where you played Courting Phoenix and made the Three-Lives Tree bloom with flowers. After that, you formed a relationship with the Divine Phoenix Mountain. You don’t know how curious I was back then because those were ancient phoenix songs, so how could an outsider play them so well?”

Ji Zixi talked for a long time, looking innocent and adorable. She suddenly thought of something and smiled, “Oh, right! Was that woman back then your wife you spoke of in the Heavenly Void? She’s really a beauty!”

Lin Yun merely smiled and said nothing.

“Big Brother Lin, it’s not convenient to talk about her?” Ji Zixi suddenly became curious.

“There’s nothing inconvenient about it,” Lin Yun smiled. He had already told Su Ziyao about Yue Weiwei, and Su Ziyao didn’t mind. So Lin Yun naturally had no reservations about it. If he couldn’t sever this love, he might as well accept it and follow his heart.

“I didn’t marry Weiwei, but… it’s just a matter of time,” Lin Yun said, looking at the boundless Mirror Lake.

Ji Zixi was surprised before she wore a playful expression with a hint of joy in her eyes. But she said nothing and merely smiled.

“W-What’s wrong with you?” Lin Yun couldn’t help asking when he noticed Ji Zixi’s weird expression.

“Hehe, I won’t tell you!” Ji Zixi smiled. She ran over to the lake, and continued, “Big Brother Lin, let’s go down and see. The scenery down below is really beautiful!”
