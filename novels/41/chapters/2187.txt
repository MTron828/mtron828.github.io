Chapter 2188 - You Asked If I Dare?

The Thousand Plume Great Saint’s voice was soft, but it was clearly heard by Lin Yun. Lin Yun raised his head and his gaze fell onto the sword in Tian Xuanzi’s hand. This was a slender sword with an astonishing length, but there was nothing special about it aside from that.

Lin Yun instantly figured out the origin of this sword. This should be the Sovereign Saint Sword from the Hidden Sword Manor that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint mentioned. The Hidden Sword Manor once forged two Sovereign Saint Swords, the Firmament Sword and Cauldron Sword. Together, they could even be compared to a divine artifact, and they were powerful swords in the world.

The Sword Sect also had a Scarlet Firmament Sword, but it was in the hands of the sect master, Mu Xuankong, and it couldn’t be compared to Tian Xuanzi’s Firmament Sword.

“Is it because of that sword?” Lin Yun muttered.

“No.” When the other Saints gathered around the Thousand Plume Great Saint, Ye Guhan had come to Lin Yun’s side. He said, “Even without that sword, the Thousand Plume Great Saint would have still lost. But without that sword, the Thousand Plume Great Saint wouldn’t be so heavily injured, and he’s…”

Ye Guhan didn’t carry on any further, but Lin Yun could sense that the Thousand Plume Great Saint should be in a terrible condition. He took a deep breath and calmly looked at Tian Xuanzi. Lin Yun was nervous before they fought, and he was afraid that Tian Xuanzi would win. But after the outcome was determined, Lin Yun became calm, and even Ye Guhan was surprised by his composure.

Thinking that Lin Yun had lost his motivation, Ye Guhan turned to look at Lin Yun only to notice the flames blazing violently within the depths of his eyes.

Ye Guhan knew that Lin Yun had grown up. If someone else at his age had to face someone like Tian Xuanzi, there would only be two outcomes. One would be going insane from the pressure and be consumed by hatred. In the past, Ye Guhan noticed that Lin Yun had shown such traces. This was why he didn’t want to give Lin Yun any pressure and make Lin Yun take up the position as the Heavenly Dao Sect’s holy son. Then again, this was also because Ye Guhan had some selfish motives.

The second outcome would be falling into depression with a demon forming in the heart. But Lin Yun was neither because he grew up.

“Can I help the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s injuries?” Lin Yun asked.

Ye Guhan knew that Lin Yun was talking about the blue dragon aura. He shook his head, “It doesn’t have much use on him. The Thousand Plume Great Saint’s Saint Soul is injured and his skull has been pierced.”

Lin Yun took a deep breath, and he had a hint of chill in his eyes when he looked at Tian Xuanzi.

After the commotion caused by the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s fall settled down, everyone’s gazes fell onto Tian Xuanzi. With that, Tian Xuanzi had weighed the entire Eastern Desolation with his victory. From today onwards, Tian Xuanzi would be invincible beneath the Emperor Realm, and this made many people feel complicated. They all felt a great pressure because they knew that there would be a huge change within the Eastern Desolation.

The moment Tian Xuanzi reached the Emperor Realm, he would be able to unify the Eastern Desolation sooner or later with the support of the Empress. Tian Xuanzi was a chess piece left behind in the Eastern Desolation by the Empress, and this wasn’t a secret because many top-tiered experts knew about it.

“Congratulations to the Profound Sky Great Saint!”

“After today, the Profound Sky Great Saint will have your name spread throughout the Kunlun Realm!”

“I feel that the Profound Sky Great Saint can reach the Emperor Realm sooner or later.”

The silence lasted for a short time before many people from the other holy lands stepped forth with smiles on their faces as they congratulated Tian Xuanzi.

There were some who were much older than Tian Xuanzi who wore a smile on their faces as they began to warmly interact with Tian Xuanzi. After defeating the Thousand Plume Great Saint, it was absolutely certain that he would reach the Emperor Realm based on his invincible momentum.

The Kunlun Realm was a place where the strong would be respected, and everyone might as well go with the flow since they couldn’t do anything about it. Amongst them, the saints from the Ming Cult looked the happiest. After all, the sect master was the first to befriend Tian Xuanzi, even lowered his status and became sworn brothers with the latter. So even if there would be a huge change in the future, the Ming Cult would definitely be able to have a spot.

The other holy lands were also trying their best to befriend Tian Xuanzi, but Ji Zixi and the old man from the Divine Phoenix Mountain didn’t step forth. Not only did they not have any intentions of befriending Tian Xuanzi, but they even put some distance away from him.

“Grandfather, why aren’t you going over?” Ji Zixi asked with a smile as she looked at the old man. It turned out that this old man was the grandfather of Ji Zixi. But because he was dressed in a coarse robe and looked old, he didn’t attract much attention.

“If we look at it, our Divine Phoenix Mountain has an even longer history than the Divine Dragon Empire. Back then, when the Dragon Gate was at its prime, we didn’t have to deliberately befriend them, not to mention a mere chess piece. But I have to admit that this is an outstanding chess piece,” the old man said as he looked at Tian Xuanzi.

“What do you think of him, then?” Ji Zixi turned to look at Lin Yun. She didn’t forget about her agreement with Lin Yun during the Blue Dragon Record. She might be the little princess of the Divine Phoenix Mountain and was loved by the elders, but she couldn’t make the decision on such important matters. This was why she took this opportunity to bring her grandfather over. She wanted to let her grandfather take a look and see if Lin Yun was worth investing.

There were people who paid attention to Tian Xuanzi, but there were also those who paid attention to Lin Yun. Ji Zixi was known as one of the three beauties of the Kunlun Realm, and she looked with anticipation and uneasiness. She couldn’t make the decision on what Lin Yun said, but her grandfather could.

“He already impressed me when he killed the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint. I am now sure and look forward to him coming to the Divine Dragon Mountain as a guest,” the old man said seriously.

“Such a high evaluation?” Ji Zixi was surprised.

The old man smiled, “That high.”

He didn’t say much, but he was touched by Lin Yun’s gaze. He could see the endless hatred in Lin Yun’s eyes, but he couldn’t sense any resentment coming from him. It was rare to see such a pure youth, and Lin Yun was destined to be extraordinary in the future. After all, he maintained his restraint even when facing a colossal mountain like Tian Xuanzi, and he didn’t fall into extreme emotions. It was rare for someone like that, especially when it comes to a swordsman, since swordsmen were the easiest to fall into the control of their extreme emotions.

The strongest swordsman would always be someone who knew how to restrain himself or they would’ve long become a slave of their sword. Furthermore, the conversation between the two also determined the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s attitude.

Tian Xuanzi was surrounded by everyone as he wore a smile and swept a glance at the Gale Rein Great Saint. He didn’t sheath the Firmament Sword, but smiled, “Gale Rein Great Saint, it’s your turn now.”

The Gale Rein Great Saint’s face froze, before he smiled, “The Profound Sky Great Saint must be joking. You have reached the nineteenth stage with the Profound Sky Canon, and the Thousand Plume Great Saint would’ve lost his life if you didn’t show any mercy. So why would I dare to fight someone who is invincible beneath the Emperor Realm?”

His humble speech caused much dissatisfaction amongst the Heavenly Dao Sect, and an uproar could be heard. The guests from other holy lands also wore sarcastic expressions. The Thousand Plume Great Saint at least had the guts to fight Tian Xuanzi, but the Gale Rein Great Saint didn’t even have that courage. But they didn’t say anything because they also wouldn’t dare to fight Tian Xuanzi if they were in the Gale Rein Great Saint’s position.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Tian Xuanzi sheathed his sword, and said, “Back then, the Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng intruded the Heavenly Dao Sect and wasn’t able to retreat. In the end, the Southern Emperor had to make a move to save him. But today, I can’t even find an opponent in the Heavenly Dao Sect. It looks like the title as the strongest holy land should change, and I think the Ming Cult is very suitable.”

The Ming Cult’s Saints smiled, “We dare not. After the Profound Sky Great Saint reaches the Emperor Realm, the Profound Sky Sect would become a holy land. At that time, no one will say a word if the Profound Sky Sect wants to rule the Eastern Desolation.”

With the Ming Cult’s Saints taking the lead, everyone echoed along.

But Ye Guhan couldn’t stand it anymore, and mocked, “Tian Xuanzi, stop trying to show off here. You’re too weak, so weak to the point that the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword couldn’t be bothered to make a move against you.”

Ye Guhan wasn’t polite at all as he called Tian Xuanzi by his name. He then continued, “If you’ve shown off enough, you can get lost now. If you have the guts, why don’t you swing a sword at Dao Yang Mountain and Heavenly Yin Mountain?”

The surroundings fell into silence. Everyone was shocked by Ye Guhan’s temper.

But Tian Xuanzi wasn’t furious. He smiled, “Azure River, you’re still as naughty as before.”

“We’re not familiar with each other. If you dare to come when my master undergoes his tribulation, I guarantee you that the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciples will take your life,” Ye Guhan said.

Everyone’s faces changed when they heard that because this was a sensitive topic, and many people felt that the Radiant Sword Saint would die. No one was optimistic of the Radiant Sword Saint making it through this tribulation.

Everyone might be calling Tian Xuanzi the strongest beneath the Emperor Realm, but in reality, no one would take that title seriously as long as the Radiant Sword Saint was around. Anyone who witnessed the Radiant Sword Saint’s strength knew how terrifying he was. There were even rumors that even Emperors couldn’t suppress the Radiant Great Saint. This was because the Ming Cult’s sect master once fought with the Radiant Sword Saint.

As one of the nine ancient domains, many holy lands and clans have been targeting the Ancient Barren Domain. But the Radiant Sword Saint repelled them for the past three thousand years, and he even once had an unfathomable record of fighting a hundred enemies by himself, and he was no different from a legend.

This was why Tian Xuanzi wanted to weigh the Eastern Desolation. It was hard to say that he wasn’t competing with the Radiant Sword Saint. Since the Radiant Sword Saint guarded the Ancient Barren Domain for thousands of years, he would weigh the Eastern Desolation and challenge the six holy lands.

In terms of reputation, Tian Xuanzi’s current reputation wasn’t at all inferior to the Radiant Sword Saint’s. But everyone knew that the Radiant Sword Saint forged his reputation through killing, and god knows how many lives he had taken with his sword, which included many Saints and even Great Saints.

The moment the Radiant Sword Saint was mentioned, Tian Xuanzi’s invincible aura became more restrained, and his smile disappeared. He looked at Ye Guhan, and said, “Since you’ve asked me if I dare to come, I’ll tell you now that I will definitely be there.”
