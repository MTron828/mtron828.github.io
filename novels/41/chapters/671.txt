Chapter 672 - My Love, Priceless

Lin Yun’s answer was still the same as before. He was from the Sword Firmament Pavilion of the Great Qin Empire. But this time, there was an additional title, Flower Burial.

But this made everyone even more doubtful. A genius who defeated so many geniuses in Skymound City was from the Great Qin Empire? The Great Qin Empire had some fame in the Ancient Southern Domain, but it was an insignificant place that could be neglected in everyone’s eyes.

One must know that the geniuses of Skymound City didn’t even place the geniuses of other prefectural cities in their eyes, not to mention the Great Qin Empire. But it was this youth who came from the Great Qin Empire who defeated the geniuses of Skymound City.

Even Xiang Tianhe, a monstrous genius on the inner ranking, was evenly matched with him. In fact, he had only obtained a slight advantage with his last palm. Xiang Tianhe couldn’t accept this outcome, nor could anyone else. A genius on the inner ranking couldn’t suppress someone from the Great Qin Empire?

“No matter how you look at it, it doesn’t look like he’s from the Great Qin Empire…”

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion? I’ve never heard of it. Where did this brat come from?”

“Aside from the seven geniuses in Skymound City, it looks like no one can suppress him. Xiang Tianhe can’t even defeat him in four moves, so he’s probably too embarrassed to make a move now.”

“This is too embarrassing…” Many local cultivators from Skymound City sighed.

Only Yang Fan and Guo Xu had excitement on their faces. Although they knew that Lin Yun didn’t reveal his true strength back then in the gathering, they never expected that Lin Yun could actually face a genius on the inner ranking.

“Boss Luo, are you the one in charge of this auction or is it the various clans in Skymound City and Qing Ruoyou? This is annoying. Shouldn’t I own the Divine Indigo Radiantstone by now? I need an answer. If this auction is nothing but a laughingstock, I can give up on the Divine Indigo Radiantstone,” said Lin Yun. He was starting to get annoyed because these people didn’t break the limit and none of them paid 800,000 third grade spiritual jades to fight him.

Luo Yu stroked his beard and smiled, “Hehe, I’m not the one in charge nor is Princess Ruoyou. The rules are in charge!”

The moment Luo Yu mentioned the rules, his face turned dark as he sneered, “I believe those who jumped out will make up for the price of breaking the limit. As for the Divine Indigo Radiantstone, it’s naturally yours since no one is able to defeat you. At the very least, no one can take it away from you today!”

When the various forces heard this, their faces became ugly. Not only had they embarrassed themselves, but they still had to pay an astronomical price. In the blink of an eye, everyone looked at Lin Yun as they gnashed their teeth.

But they were even more shocked that the Divine Indigo Radiantstone had gone to Lin Yun despite the fact that Qing Ruoyou had her eyes on it. Qing Ruoyou was a genius ranked thirty five in the inner ranking. But she had lost to Lin Yun. It was an outcome that no one had expected.

Qing Ruoyou’s eyes flashed coldly as she looked at Lin Yun. But a long time later, she seemed to have made a decision as she spoke out, “I have no objection to you obtaining the Divine Indigo Radiantstone, but can you sell it to me? It doesn’t matter if it’s a cultivation technique, cosmic artifact, armor, or pellets, I can give you whatever you want. In addition to that, I can promise you one thing as long as it’s within my capability.”

“Ruoyou…” Xiang Tianhe called out as he tried to stop her. However, he soon lowered his head when Qing Ruoyou glared at him. In the end, he could only scream internally.

This was a great opportunity for him and the promise should have been his. But now, the promise had gone to Lin Yun instead, which was something that he couldn’t accept.

“This brat is really lucky. Princess Ruoyou is actually willing to use a favor in exchange for the Divine Indigo Radiantstone.”

“If I was in his position, I would definitely ask Princess Ruoyou for a meal together in a pavilion.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Even the three kings and seven elites couldn’t get a promise from Princess Ruoyou. But she’s actually willing to give a promise to Lin Yun. If news of this gets out…tsk tsk…” Everyone was looking at Lin Yun with envy.

Lin Yun was shocked as he raised his head to look at Qing Ruoyou. Although she had tried her best to conceal herself, he could still detect a trace of loathing in her expression. Furthermore, judging from her aloof expression, she probably thought she made a huge concession.

Interesting… In their first meeting, she clearly wanted to recruit Lin Yun into the Indigomoon Elysium, but she was so arrogant that she wanted Lin Yun to beg her. Now, she didn’t even bow her head, but only stated that she would give Lin Yun a single promise.

She was definitely too naive to think that Lin Yun would hand over the Divine Indigo Radiantstone like other geniuses. Unfortunately for her, Lin Yun had a great use for it.

“Sorry, but I refuse.” Lin Yun rejected without any hesitation, catching everyone by surprise.

It was rare for Qing Ruoyou to lower her head, not to mention that she had convinced herself with great difficulty to lower her head to Lin Yun. But in the end, she was rejected.

Qing Ruoyou was blessed with both beauty and talent. There had never been anyone who could reject her so decisively.

Xiang Tianhe widened his mouth as he looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. Lin Yun actually rejected Qing Ruoyou’s promise? Did he have a screw loose in his mind?

Lin Yun didn’t care about everyone’s shock as he turned to leave. He didn’t want to stay here any longer.

“Lin Yun, I hope that you can reconsider. I don’t give out promises easily,” said Qing Ruoyou once more. She wanted the Divine Indigo Radiantstone. At the same time, she couldn’t believe that someone would actually reject her.

“My love is priceless, so I’ll never give this away,” said Lin Yun without even turning back.

Qing Ruoyou bit on her lips as she looked at Lin Yun coldly with killing intent rising in her heart.

After Lin Yun left, the auction resumed. But the atmosphere had died down as everyone was still discussing what just happened.

What happened today would definitely spread throughout Skymound City and the name Flower Burial Lin Yun would be famous. After all, he made Yang Pengfei and Chen Xiong kneel before him.

As for the three other geniuses, they were in an even more terrible state. Today, Lin Yun had thoroughly humiliated the Jin Clan, Qin Clan, Gu Clan, Chen Clan, and the Skycloud Sect.

They were all arrogant, but in the end, they were trampled by Lin Yun. Even Xiang Tianhe couldn’t do a thing when he interfered. But the main topic of discussion was how Qing Ruoyou was rejected despite the fact that she offered Lin Yun a promise.

Everyone could still remember what Lin Yun had said and they guessed that there was a deeper meaning to it. When Lin Yun said ‘My love is priceless,’ he was probably referring to the person he loved and not the stone. After all, Lin Yun clearly didn’t need the Divine Indigo Radiantstone personally, so there was no need for him to waste so much effort to get it.

So there was a high possibility that he did it for his love, who might even be more beautiful than Qing Ruoyou. Otherwise, it made no sense for him to reject Qing Ruoyou so decisively. But then again, everyone sneered at this analysis.

Perhaps there were women who could compare to Qing Ruoyou in terms of beauty, but it was practically impossible for someone to surpass her. Furthermore, Qing Ruoyou wasn’t just beautiful, but she also had a monstrous talent.

The bald monk sat on the rooftop as he drank his wine and smiled, “What an excellent show. This brat is the center of attention wherever he goes. Hehe, no wonder he’s my friend.”

The bald monk was Drifting Goblet. As he spoke, he glanced at the graceful woman standing beside him. He was stunned because he actually saw a smile on the corner of her lips. He instantly wondered if his eyes were messing with him.

A long time later, he retracted his gaze with a bitter smile. If he had remembered correctly, this should be the first time he saw a smile on her face. With her beauty, how could Lin Yun be interested in Qing Ruoyou?

These people are really naive… smiled Drifting Goblet.
