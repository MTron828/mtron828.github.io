Chapter 1877 - Nether Orchid Holy Maiden

Lin Yun continued, ignoring everything else, and soon distanced himself from everyone else behind him. In the end, Chen Feng gritted his teeth. He discovered that Ye Qingtian seemed to have forgotten many things. Then again, it wasn’t surprising because he was heavily injured a year ago, not to mention refining a saint origin might mess up his memories.

“Senior Brother, you really can’t go there. Have you forgotten that she’s the direct disciple of the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint?” Chen Feng quickly caught up to Lin Yun.

“The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint? That name sounds familiar…” Lin Yun held onto his chin because he had heard of this name before.

Chen Feng was shocked and explained, “Senior Brother, they're one of the three Sword Saints in the Eastern Desolation. They're an existence on the same level as the Radiant Sword Saint.”

At this moment, Chen Feng confirmed that something had gone wrong with Ye Qingtian’s head. After all, how could someone not even remember the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint? Ye Qingtian probably didn’t want to remember that incident, thus forgetting everything.

“What has it got to do with me, then?” Lin Yun probed. He didn’t even know if the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was a male or female. But since this person could be put on the same level as his master, they should be at least a thousand years old. It wasn’t an exaggeration to call someone of this level an old monster, and it made no sense for Ye Qingtian to provoke an expert like that.

“T-This…” Chen Feng contemplated for a long time, then wiped the sweat on his forehead. “I have no idea how to tell you about it.”

“I have a grudge against him?” Lin Yun asked.

“I don’t think so…”

“I secretly learned his inheritance?”

“Of course not.”

“I injured his disciple?”

“How is this even possible? You don’t have that strength.” Chen Feng blurted in a hurry, and he quickly lowered his head when he saw Lin Yun’s face sinking down.

“Then, why can’t I go there?” Lin Yun was determined to visit the Nether Orchid Courtyard to see if the Solar Lunar Divine Rune was there. But when he arrived outside the Nether Orchid Courtyard, he saw a stone tablet before him.

“Wielding a sword and waiting for the breeze, a gentleman’s sword. The Nether Orchid Courtyard.” Lin Yun recited the words on the stone tablet. The front of the courtyard was covered with Nether Orchid Flowers.

The Flower Burial Sword suddenly began to vibrate, making Lin Yun fall into deep thoughts. When he looked at it clearly, he noticed that those Nether Orchid Flowers contained a massive sword intent. They were long mature but stopped from blooming under a certain power. The moment those flowers bloom, they would form into a horrifying sword array.

“How bustling…” Lin Yun retracted his gaze and saw that the Nether Orchid Courtyard was brightly lit with many people inside. Under the light, their shadows were reflected on the window.

Chen Feng tip-toed to take a peek before speaking out, “Senior Brother, they should be holding a Sword Discussion Gathering.”

“Sword Discussion Gathering…” Lin Yun now knew that Chen Feng would explain many things to him as long as he kept quiet. He had just become a saint disciple, and all the disciples on the Indigo Thunder Peak wanted to flatter him, including Liu Hao, who previously occupied his courtyard.

It was boring because Lin Yun had yet to truly make a move, and everyone already started flattering him. Then again, this must be related to Ye Qingtian’s personality.

Before he even asked more about it, Chen Feng smiled, “Yeah. They will hold it once every three to five months by saint disciples. The host, this time, is the chief disciple, Bai Shuying. This is the reason why the Sword Discussion Gathering is so bustling this time.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered Ye Qingtian’s personality and wore a smile. But his confident smile was an entirely different scenery in the eyes of the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples.

“Senior Brother is really a man. He’s absolutely dashing!”

“Hehe, I bet Senior Brother must be remembering the past.”

“Hahaha. Even if our Senior Brother is a scumbag, only he saw the scenery of the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden.”

“Don’t tell me Senior Brother is really going to the Nether Orchid Courtyard. If he dares to enter, I’ll recognize him as the chief disciple of the Indigo Thunder Peak for the rest of my life.”

Lin Yun’s lip twitched when he heard those words, buy he could only respond with a smile. He didn’t expect these people to misunderstand his intention, which made him wonder what Ye Qingtian did in the past.

It was still alright before, but he was really panicking a little now. Then again, he couldn’t explain and could only put on an act and continue forth.

Right then, a snicker resounded, “Hahaha. I was wondering who it was to look so familiar. Isn’t this the ‘legendary genius’ of the Ye Clan, Ye Qingtian? I just heard that you've returned, and the first thing you did was to come to the Nether Orchid Courtyard?”

Lin Yun turned around and saw a blue-robed youth walking over.

“Senior Brother, t-they’re from the Blue Curtain Peak.” Chen Feng’s face became pale, and even his speech became stuttered.

The group of Indigo Thunder Peak disciples were startled by this scene before they scattered. They either lowered their heads or raised their heads to look at the scenery in the surroundings.

“Get lost!” But the disciples of the Blue Curtain Peak weren’t polite as they stepped forth and pushed all the Indigo Thunder Peak disciples away. None of the Indigo Thunder Peak disciples dared to speak. Everyone who was gathered behind Lin Yun just a moment ago had long scattered away, hiding in the bushes to look in this direction.

The person leading the party from the Blue Curtain Peak was called Hou Feng. He had a dashing appearance and looked extraordinary. When he came before Lin Yun, his pupils were filled with mockery.

On the other hand, Chen Feng was terrified as he hid behind Lin Yun, trembling in fear. He even secretly signaled Lin Yun to leave this place.

But Lin Yun had already come, so why would he leave?

“Ye Qingtian, what are you doing here?” Hou Feng asked with a playful smile.

“To participate in the Sword Discussion Gathering.” Lin Yun indifferently replied.

The disciples of the Blue Curtain Peak burst into laughter, and even Hou Feng couldn’t hold back his laughter.

“Hahaha! Did you guys hear that? This piece of garbage wants to attend the Sword Discussion Gathering!”

“Hahaha! Senior Brother Hou, he must have gone insane!”

“That’s possible. After all, Senior Brother Zhang Yue didn’t go easy on him back then.”

“Hahaha! Ye Qingtian is here to participate in the Sword Discussion Gathering. Hahaha! There’s no bigger joke than this!”

The Indigo Thunder Peak disciples had shame on their faces, with some who couldn't leave in time and could only pretend that they weren’t here.

As for Lin Yun, he didn’t even bat an eye at Hou Feng and carried on walking into the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

This scene naturally made Hou Feng furious. After all, a piece of garbage like Ye Qingtian actually dared to disregard him. Hou Feng was pretty famous within the Heavenly Dao Sect, since he was ranked in the top two hundredths within the inner sect, aside from the saint disciples.

On the contrary, Ye Qingtian couldn’t even be ranked within the top five hundredths a year ago. Ye Qingtian might be the chief disciple of the Indigo Thunder Peak, but the Indigo Thunder Peak was ranked at the bottom amongst all the peaks within the Heavenly Dao Sect. As for saint disciples, they only had five to six.

Otherwise, the Peak Master wouldn’t have rejoiced when he saw Lin Yun’s cultivation at the Profound Death Stage. So Hou Feng naturally wouldn’t put Ye Qingtian in his eyes. Ye Qingtian would've reached like a rat whenever they met in the past.

“Ye Qingtian, why aren’t you kneeling and barking like in the past?”

“Otherwise, you won’t be able to come out of this unscathed today!”

“Senior Brother Hou, it looks like Ye Qingtian needs to be taught a lesson. It appears that he has forgotten it all after a year of no beatings!”

The Blue Curtain Peak’s Hou Feng had an extraordinary background, and all the disciples around him naturally wanted to stand out in front of him.

“Senior Brother Hou, let me teach him a lesson.” A person carrying a sword box dashed forth, not putting Ye Qingtian in his eyes. Evidently, he still considered Ye Qingtian to be the same person as before, and wanted to teach Ye Qingtian a lesson to make him go down on his knees and bark like a dog.

This person's name was Cheng Tian and his cultivation was at the eighth stage of the Dragon Pulse Realm. Even the Ye Qingtian from a year ago wouldn’t be placed in his eyes. He was fast as he left behind afterimages in his path.

But Ye Qingtian suddenly disappeared in front of him. In the next second, a sword flashed before him. When Cheng Tian regained his vision, blood was gushing out from his right shoulder, sending him flying under that sword. Even his right shoulder was nearly severed under that attack.

“H-How is that possible?!” Everyone was dumbfounded, with disbelief filling their pupils.

Lin Yun had sheathed the Flower Burial Sword so quickly that no one could see what had happened. They could only see Cheng Tian being sent flying away, and Lin Yun didn’t even move. So they began to look around to see if someone was hiding in the surroundings.

“Don’t appear before me in the future, or it won’t end with just a wound on your shoulder.” Lin Yun indifferently said.

“Holy shit!”

“Is this all real? That sword from Senior Brother is too dashing!”

“Senior Brother is really strong!” The Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples, who pretended not to know Lin Yun a moment ago, immediately stepped out from the woods.

“Cheng Tian, what’s going on? You actually lost to a piece of garbage like him?”

“Did you go easy on him?!” The Blue Curtain Peak disciples roared.

Cheng Tian had shame on his face, before he lowered his head. “I was careless. That piece of garbage seems to have become stronger compared to a year ago.”

“Get lost, you trash.” Hou Feng kicked Cheng Tian away, and roared, “You can’t even beat a piece of garbage like him. You have completely embarrassed the Blue Curtain Peak! He has gotten stronger? Let me show you that a piece of garbage will still be a piece of garbage!”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After kicking Cheng Tian away, Hou Feng dashed forth. His movement technique was even more profound than Cheng Tian's, instantly disappearing before everyone as though he had teleported. He couldn’t accept that Ye Qingtian could suddenly become strong when he was a piece of garbage a year ago. After all, Senior Brother Zhang Yue nearly crippled Ye Qingtian’s cultivation a year ago.

When Ye Qingtian left the Heavenly Dao Sect a year ago, he was no different from a dog. When Hou Feng reappeared, he stood before Lin Yun and coldly said, “Ye Qingtian, do you know why everyone hates you?”

But Lin Yun merely looked at Hou Feng calmly. An opponent of this level couldn’t arouse his interest.

“That face of yours is annoying in the eyes of others!”
