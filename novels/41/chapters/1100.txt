Chapter 1101 - Practising Sword Technique With Seven Steps (2)

“I admit defeat.” Feng Zhang said with an unwilling attitude. “I’ll give up on the quota to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain. But you have some explaining to do. How did you withstand ten of my moves? Did you use some sort of treasure to boost your strength temporarily?”

The crowd was stunned before they realized that there was really something fishy about Lin Yun. After all, the Wind Manipulating Sword Technique was a monarch fortune martial technique, and it defied common sense that Lin Yun was actually able to resolve the attacks.

“There are countless treasures in the Heavenly Path, so this might really be possible.” A core disciple muttered.

“If you’ve really used it, then you cheated. We can get an elder to check if you cheated,” said Feng Zhang coldly.

Putting his holy spirits away, Lin Yun smiled, “Why do I need to cheat against such a garbage sword technique?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“What did you say?” asked Feng Zhang in disbelief.

“I said that your sword technique is nothing but utter garbage.” Lin Yun swept his glance at the core disciples and sneered, “Aren’t you guys just jealous that I’ll receive the quota to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain? No matter what, the quota is mine. If any of you aren’t convinced by my strength, I’ll show you what a true genius looks like!”

Everyone was shocked by Lin Yun’s tone because he wasn’t just trying to slap Feng Zhang’s face but all the core disciples as well. However, none of the core disciples were furious. They just thought that Lin Yun got lucky on the Heavenly Path. They believed that if they were also on the Heavenly Path, their achievement would have been higher than Lin Yun’s achievement.

Kunlun Realm had no lack of geniuses, so there weren’t many who stood out above the others. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect fell under this category as no one in the sect was weak. Furthermore, they had seen tons of heaven-defying geniuses. Although Lin Yun was strong, he was simply a frog in the well to call himself a genius before them.

“Old geezer, do you mind if I take a look at the Wind Manipulating Sword Technique?” Lin Yun said as he glanced at the sect master.

The elders were furious because this was already the second time that Lin Yun was so rude to the sect master. But the sect master merely smiled in response, “Give it to him. He’s already a core disciple, so there’s no issue if he takes a look at the Wind Manipulating Sword Technique.”

It didn’t take long for an elder to step forward with a jade slip. Lin Yun merely took the jade slip, placed it against his forehead, and began to walk around the palace. His pace was neither fast nor slow, and everyone could see him clearly. They were confused at what he was doing.

As Lin Yun walked, he seemed to be emitting some sort of profundity as phenomena started to appear around him. Clouds, thunder, and even dragons began to soar into the sky.

Feng Zhang began to feel uneasy so he spoke up, “Lin Yun, how long are you going to waste our time? We have no time to waste with you!”

Lin Yun continued his pace and completely ignored Feng Zhang. After taking his seventh step, he opened his eyes and waved his hand. In the next second, he summoned the Flower Burial Sword from his sword box.

His action had left everyone baffled because Lin Yun had only paced around for seven steps. The Wind Manipulating Sword Technique was a monarch fortune martial technique, so wasn’t Lin Yun a little too overconfident? Even the core disciples wore disdain on their faces at this sight.

“The first sword, Firmament Shaking Wind!” Lin Yun swung his sword out while lightning rumbling on his sword. When everyone raised their heads, they couldn’t see any lightning except for clouds tumbling in the sky. They instantly realized that it wasn’t the sound of thunder they were hearing but the violent movement of wind that caused the rumbling.

Lin Yun had reached a high stage that not many people could accomplish. Even Feng Zhang’s face had changed. However, he didn’t think it was impressive because he could also do it.

But shortly after, everyone’s faces changed because it wasn’t the wind that made the noise, but a dragon! As the dragon flew through the thunderclouds, it tore the thunderclouds in its path apart and released a ferocious roar.

In Lin Yun’s hands, the scale of the phenomena was completely different from when Feng Zhang had used it. It was like the difference between a dragon and a worm. After one glance, Feng Zhang’s sword fell to the ground. He was completely dumbstruck.

“Second sword, Wind Manipulating Lightning!” But before everyone could recover from their shock, Lin Yun swung out another sword with ghastly howls ringing out of the horizon that made many inner disciples tremble. At the same time, a horrifying-looking head appeared from the clouds that caused many disciples to lose consciousness.

“It’s the heavenly ghost!” Elders on the stage began to tremble with excitement because this was the phenomenon only achievable after reaching the legendary manifestation stage. It had been hundreds of years since any disciple had reached that level.

Even thee core disciples who were laughing at Lin Yun earlier were stunned. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing right now.

“Third sword, Wave Riding Wind!” Lin Yun followed with an unbelievably fast stab through eighten layers of water screens. Then, a wave poured out of the water screens that was so high that the sky couldn’t block the attack. The sword was simply breathtaking.

When everyone saw this scene, they were completely convinced by what Lin Yun said earlier. Compared to Lin Yun’s version, Feng Zhang’s version wasn’t just terrible, it was trash. They couldn’t believe that Feng Zhang had the guts to question Lin Yun’s integrity.

The whole situation had turned into a huge joke. After looking at Lin Yun’s sword technique, Feng Zhang’s sword technique looked like it was full of flaws. The crowd was confident that they could resolve Feng Zhang’s attacks the same way that Lin Yun did. However, they knew it wouldn’t be as easy as Lin Yun made it seem.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun’s sword kept moving faster, leaving everyone breathless by his performance. When Lin Yun performed the last sword, he sheathed his sword and descended from the sky. However, the crowd couldn’t recover from the shock they were feeling.

Aside from the sect master, everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was dumbfounded that Lin Yun only used seven steps to master a monarch fortune martial technique to the level of the manifestation stage.

The core disciples who were mocking Lin Yun just a moment ago wore unsightly faces because they could feel their cheeks aching from the invisible slap that Lin Yun gave them.

However, Lin Yun didn’t let them go off easily, “The quota to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain is mine! Is there anyone who agrees or disagrees?!”

Lin Yun’s words placed all the core disciples under immense pressure. He was only in the heavenly Soul Realm, but there was nothing they could do against him. After all, Lin Yun had mastered a powerful sword technique in just seven steps. It was a feat that no one was confident they could mimic.

The day was supposed to be peaceful, but Lin Yun had other plans. Now, he left the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect in chaos. And no one dared to disagree anymore.
