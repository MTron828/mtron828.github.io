Chapter 1333 - Entering the Pagoda

As the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda descended at an incredible speed, boundless starlight gushed from the pagoda, leaving terrifying cracks around in the surrounding space. Everyone could see that not only this entire space, but the restriction on the entire Profound Wither Island was swiftly being torn apart.

“Watch out!”

“Everyone! Quickly, leave!” The falling speed of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda was so fast that it looked like a terrifyingly powerful star falling from the nine heavens.

“Senior Brother, what should we do?” Lei Jue and Xuan Ying both became nervous. Their Profound Sky Sect wasn’t lucky, since they were at the center of where the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda fell.

Qin Cang looked at Lin Yun’s direction with a cold light flashing through his pupils before he retracted his gaze. “We’ll deal with them together!”

“Okay!” The three of them circulated the Profound Sky Canon and became enveloped in a glittering light. But that wasn’t all. Qin Cang said, “Those at the Greater Elysium Core Realm act together with me!”

He had a strong prestige in the Profound Sky Sect. So without his orders, none of the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts dared to leave by themselves. After hearing what Qin Cang said, the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts circulated the Profound Sky Canon as well. In the next second, they were all enveloped in heavy armor that were emitting crimson lights, and the armor had ancient runes engraved on them.

When their aura connected together, Qin Cang began to form seals with his hands. Just when the Seven Treasure Glazed Tiled Pagoda was about to land, Qin Cang let out a roar, while successfully forming his seal, “Break!”

The light that enveloped the entire Profound Sky Sect immediately reached the peak before the surrounding space distorted and they disappeared. When they disappeared, the Seven Treasure Glazed Tiled Pagoda finally landed on the ground and caused cracks to spread out.

The cracks on the ground were in the form of cobwebs that swiftly spread out to the entire Profound Wither Island. Just like that, the massive Profound Wither Island was riddled with hundreds of cracks that were splitting it apart.

This was simply too terrifying, and the Profound Wither Island looked like it would crumble into pieces in the next moment. Right at this moment, light shone from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tiled Pagoda and attracted everyone’s attention.

When the Seven Treasure Glazed Tiled Pagoda was still in the sky and the light was restricted by the Great Saint Origin, everyone couldn’t see the pagoda clearly. But now that the pagoda had fallen down, everyone could finally take a closer look at it. At the same time, this also left them dumbfounded because they could tell that this pagoda definitely had a huge origin.

Although they were all amazed by the Seven Treasure Glazed Tiled Pagoda, none of them could think about getting it. After all, the pressure from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tiled Pagoda was too powerful, and they felt like mere ants before it. So how could mere ants move a mountain?

“The Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda!” Lin Yun was breathless while looking at the pagoda enveloped in a sacred light after putting Ye Ziling and the rest down.

“To be exact, it’s the Nine Heavenly Seven Treasure Glazed Tiled Pagoda!” Lil’ Purple said in a solemn voice in the sword box.

But Lin Yun didn’t care about her. When he swept his gaze over the Seven Treasure Glazed Tiled Pagoda, he could see the Profound Sky Sect’s party. Under the protection of the Three Saints of the Profound Sky Sect and so many Greater Elysium Core Realm experts, they were unscathed. On the other hand, the other powerful sects suffered some casualties, including the Sword Sect. But the Vajra Monastery wasn’t too affected by the fall of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tiled Pagoda.

“The Profound Sky Sect is really terrifying, and that Profound Sky Saint Sovereign is truly a figure.” Lin Yun couldn’t help exclaiming at the strength of the Profound Sky Sect. At the same time, he now knew why they were the undisputed overlord of the Ancient Barren Domain.

“Tian Xuanzi is the strongest genius who appeared in the Kunlun Realm in the past millennium, and many people have speculated that there was a possibility that he could become an emperor,” said Su Ziyao.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned when he heard that and asked, “Comparable to the Nine Emperors?”

The Nine Emperors appeared three thousand years ago, and they were practically legends in the Kunlun Realm. When he heard that the Profound Sky Saint Sovereign had a chance of becoming an emperor, Lin Yun naturally thought about the Nine Emperors.

“Hard to say,” replied Su Ziyao. “Emperor symbolizes a realm and title. They prayed to heaven and received the acknowledgment of the Divine Dragon Era. There were also many martial emperors during the darkest era, but they were either killed by the Nine Emperors or didn’t dare to appear in public. So the Nine Emperors are called legends not only because they are martial emperors.”

Lin Yun had never heard about that before. Simultaneously, Ye Ziling was also shocked because this was the first time she was hearing it.

Suddenly, several figures flew towards the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda. But before they could even get close to it, they were killed by Qin Cang with a single palm, and they didn’t even leave behind their corpses. Looking at this scene, everyone calmed down because they were all intimidated by Qin Cang’s strength. This felt as though someone was grabbing them by their throats.

“Since the Great Saint Origin has appeared, then I’ll naturally have to put out a disclaimer.” Qin Cang’s cold voice echoed, “You can all rely on your ability to obtain the treasures in the pagoda, but if anyone dares to put their hands on the Great Saint Origin, then don’t blame me for being ruthless. Disciples of the Profound Sky Sect, enter the pagoda with me!”

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren!”

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren!” They were arrogant and high profile when they headed towards the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda. If it was someone else reciting that, they would look extremely stupid. But after Qin Cang displayed his strength, everyone felt that they were qualified to be arrogant.

“A bunch of fools…” The white-haired youth named Xiao Fan muttered when he looked at those people. As he spoke, he walked toward Lin Yun and the rest. When he swept his gaze across Lin Yun, he nodded his head before his gaze fell onto Su Ziyao.

“Have we met before?” Su Ziyao asked.

“I’ve seen you before, but you might not know about me. Back then, when you came with that lord to my clan, you caused a huge commotion. I was young back then, and I was standing in the crowd. So I have a deep impression of you, but you probably don’t have any impression of me,” smiled Xiao Fan.

“Indeed, I don’t have any impression of you.” Su Ziyao nodded his head.

But when Lin Yun heard that, the corner of his lips twitched because Su Ziyao really had no idea how to hold a conversation, and he now knew why she didn’t have any friends. When Xiao Fan heard what Su Ziyao said, he also couldn’t help looking awkward.

But fortunately, Lin Yun changed the topic, “You also want to compete for the Great Saint Origin?”

“I’m more interested in the pagoda, but it’s a pity that there’s no way I can take it with me…” Xiao Fan shook his head. “I’m here to see you, and I won’t compete for the Great Saint Origin. On this island, no one can defeat Qin Cang.”

“Including you?” Lin Yun asked with his face sunk.

“That’s right. When I entered the island, I sealed off most of my cultivation. I bet the one standing beside you did the same as well. We’re at too much of a disadvantage to fight Qin Cang on the Profound Wither Island,” Xiao Fan said while looking at Su Ziyao.

“The Great Saint Origin has no use for you.” Xiao Fan continued, “That Dragon Saint Pellet and Quasi-Saint Origin are better for you, so there’s no need for you to take the risk to compete for the Great Saint Origin.”

What Xiao Fan said wasn’t wrong, but his advice was futile. Lin Yun naturally had to compete for the Great Saint Origin. It wasn’t because he had the Profound Wither Key, he also had the rose painting. That painting might be one of the three Southern Emperor’s treasures, the Life-Death Painting, so he had to verify it.

The Flower Burial Sword had a huge connection with the Southern Emperor, and the Great Saint Origin was equivalent to the Profound Wither Great Saint’s ashes. So he naturally had to obtain it, not to mention that Lin Yun wasn’t convinced by Qin Cang’s strength. Strictly speaking, he hadn’t lost the fight earlier and was just in a disadvantageous position.

“Then pretend that I said nothing.” Xiao Fan already got his answer from Lin Yun’s eyes and cupped his hands together. “I’ll be taking my leave, then. Let us meet again in the future, if fate allows.”

Everyone was heading to the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda, but he was heading for the border of the Profound Wither Island, which made him stand out.

“Oh, right!” Jiang Lichen suddenly exclaimed. “That fellow was the one who stole the saint elixirs under the eyes of the Three Saints of the Profound Sky Sect!”

He was very emotional when he said that. But when he noticed that everyone was calm, he couldn’t help scratching his head in embarrassment, “Am I the only one who didn’t know about that?”

“So, are we still entering the pagoda? I feel that what he said does make some sense.” Ye Ziling ignored Jiang Lichen and turned to look at Lin Yun.

Su Ziyao also didn’t say a word and waited for Lin Yun to make a decision.

“That’s for sure. If we’re separated in the pagoda, remember to find an opportunity to gather up,” said Lin Yun.

“What about us?” Jiang Lichen said. After all, the three of them were one level weaker, and they might drag everyone down if they entered.

“Let’s go together. The pagoda doesn’t only have the Great Saint Origin, but various other opportunities, as well,” said Lin Yun. He knew that he would have to head for the Sword Sect after this matter.

The pressure that Qin Cang gave him was too huge, and the Profound Azure Prefecture was too small for him. Just Qin Cang alone was already so terrifying, so he couldn’t imagine how strong those heaven-defying geniuses on the Elysium Core Ranking would be. After all, the foundation of a powerful sect wasn’t something that he could imagine, and he had to leave the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect for the Sword Sect if he wanted to become stronger.

Now that he still had some strength, he naturally wanted to help Jiang Lichen and the rest while he could. In the future, they could only rely on themselves after he leaves the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

After the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples entered the pagoda, the other sects also began to enter it. They all had excitement written on their faces. Qin Cang was strong, but as long as they didn’t compete for the Great Saint Origin, they wouldn’t have to face him. So they would aim for the other opportunities in the pagoda, instead.

But the atmosphere between the powerful sects was heavy. Mu Qingqing turned to look at Sikong Zhou, “Senior Brother, are you alright?”

Earlier, Sikong Zhou wanted to help Lin Yun, only to be forced back with a gaze from Qin Cang, and that had enveloped the hearts of Sword Sect’s disciples in a shadow. Although everyone knew that the gaze from Qin Cang wasn’t simple, since he had activated the Demonflame Lotus, he didn’t use it when he fought Lin Yun.

So others could only see that Sikong Zhou was sent flying with a glance from Qin Cang, making him seem even weaker than Lin Yun. If Sikong Zhou was prepared beforehand, then he naturally wouldn’t lose that terribly.

“Senior Brother, that Qin Cang did it on purpose to affect your confidence, so don’t fall for it,” comforted Mu Qingqing.

“I know,” smiled Sikong Zhou. But only he knew that he was feeling bitter in his heart. He initially thought that he could fight with Qin Cang now that he had reached the Elysium Core Realm, but he never expected that the difference between them would be so huge. Even if he was careless earlier and underestimated the power of the Demonflame Lotus, it still couldn’t deny the fact that Qin Cang was really terrifying.

Sikong Zhou had a feeling that he should be at the same level as Lei Jue and Xuan Ying. On the other hand, Qin Cang was already on the same level as geniuses on the Elysium Core Ranking, so there wasn’t anyone who could be Qin Cang’s opponent on the Profound Wither Island.

“So are we still competing for the Great Saint Origin?” A Sword Sect’s disciple asked.

“Of course!” Sikong Zhou replied in a decisive tone without any hesitation. “Disciples of the Sword Sect can be defeated, but we will absolutely not give up without trying!”
