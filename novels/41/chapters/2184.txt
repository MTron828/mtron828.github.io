Chapter 2185 - Swordsman's Demeanor

Three moves again? Lin Yun bitterly smiled while already feeling numb upon hearing that. But the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint was someone at the second stage of the Heavenly Origin Phase, and he could release his Saint Soul Radiance, according to his senior brother. So he couldn’t afford to be careless in this fight.

“I hope that you can give it your all and don’t hold back,” Lin Yun said, looking at Zen Peak Quasi-Saint.

The Zen Peak Quasi-Saint smiled, “Don’t worry about it. I won’t hold back.”

Lin Yun drew out the Flower Burial Sword and pointed it at his opponent. When he pointed his sword at his opponent, boundless saint aura began to circulate within his body as a thousand galaxies spread out behind him. When the sun and moon appeared, Lin Yun’s temperament changed.

At this moment, he gave off a powerful aura while basking in the starlight. The Zen Peak Quasi-Saint was clearly stronger with his thirty-six layers of heavenly screens, but the pressure couldn’t do a thing to Lin Yun. He looked like an immortal, and all the swordsmen felt as though they could see a star shining brightly in the sky. This was the radiance of a swordsman. All the swordsmen were shocked because Lin Yun looked like a sword to them.

“Damn it!” The Zen Peak Quasi-Saint was furious that Lin Yun dared to point at a sword at him. He swung his sword, unleashing horrifying sacred flames towards Lin Yun’s head. The full attack of a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase was naturally terrifying. The sword ray he released was a hundred feet, instantly overwhelming Lin Yun and the starlight behind him. This was the full attack of someone who had cultivated for two hundred years.

“Divine Firefly Sword—Myriad Swords Unite!” Lin Yun swung his sword, unleashing thirteen afterimages that drew a circle. When Zen Peak Quasi-Saint’s attack reached the circle, the power of the sword was greatly reduced.

As the sword ray circulated, the sword released by Lin Yun’s sword grew even more dazzling, and the power of the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint’s sword was quickly eliminated. Seeing this scene, those who previously thought that Ye Qingtian was courting death were dumbfounded.

Wasn’t that the first section of the Divine Firefly Sword? Everyone recognized it, and many of them even reached an advanced level with it. But this sword technique was mysterious in Lin Yun’s hands, which felt obscure and profound.

“It looks like I didn’t teach him in vain.” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint smiled when she saw this scene.

“That brat is smart…” The Serene Dust Great Saint smiled as she looked at Lin Yun with a doting gaze. It was rare to see them not quarrel but agree at the same time.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint also smiled because he could tell from this sword that Lin Yun would be fine.

As for Ye Guhan, he smiled as he chewed on the Divine Dragon Fruit. Everyone else who was present was shocked, and those with a slightly better eyesight could tell that this sword was extraordinary.

“Ye Qingtian is really a genius, like the reincarnation of a Sword Immortal. His strength is a little too unbelievably strong.”

“Myriad Swords Unite, not many people have grasped it. But no one can use it as well as him.”

“This should be the grace of that Sword Ancestor. Who says that the light of fireflies can’t compete with the sun and moon?” The elder beside Ji Zixi nodded.

On the stage, the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint fully exhibited the advantage of his cultivation at the Quasi-Saint Realm, manipulating all his saint aura, and each sword he unleashed became terrifying. It didn’t take long for them to exchange over ten moves.

The Zen Peak Quasi-Saint said that he would make Lin Yun reveal himself with three moves, but ten moves have passed, and Ye Qingtian showed no signs of injuries. As they fought, the sword rays that they released became even more terrifying.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

No matter how much the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint increased his speed, Lin Yun could catch up with him, unleashing a massive aura. When Lin Yun executed the Divine Sunchasing Art, his speed reached a terrifying height. Paired with the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, Lin Yun could easily neutralize all of Zen Peak Quasi-Saint’s attacks.

“Streaming Ray!” The Zen Peak Quasi-Saint gritted his teeth and executed a transcendent ghost spirit martial technique, unleashing a star at Lin Yun, and his sword was thrusted towards Lin Yun, who was in mid-air.

“Dragon Sun and Moon Seal—Blood Dying Sky!” Lin Yun calmly formed a seal with one hand before swinging the Flower Burial Sword. In the next second, a terrifying phenomenon appeared on the plaza with the sky dyed red. When Lin Yun swung his sword, the crimson sun manifested into a crimson sword ray that flew over. As for the incoming sword, it was knocked away by Lin Yun by swinging his sword down, causing sparks to splash around.

“Flaming Cloud Stream!” Zen Peak Quasi-Saint held onto his sword with both hands and swung it down. When he swung his sword, the ancient ‘fire’ word behind him fused into the flaming mountain in his constellation, unleashing a sword ray that had reached a hundred feet towards Lin Yun.

Before that sword ray even descended, the galaxies behind Lin Yun began to explode under the pressure. This was because Zen Peak’s cultivation was much higher than Lin Yun’s, and he had integrated his saint dao into his Saint Soul.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun executed the second variation of the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal, “Inverting Yin-Yang!”

In the next second, the sun manifested into a golden sky while the moon manifested into a silver moon. Lin Yun stood in the middle as he held onto the Flower Burial Sword, shaking his wrist just when Zen Peak Quasi-Saint was about to reach him.

In the next second, the sky and earth inverted with the surrounding space being distorted. This scene that took place on the Blue Dragon Record reappeared; however, it was more ferocious this time because the enemies that he faced were stronger.

When the two energies collided from the slightest contact, Lin Yun’s palm cracked apart with a horrifying energy enveloping him, which was Zen Peak Quasi-Saint’s sacred flame. But when the heaven and earth ultimately inverted, Lin Yun managed to push Zen Peak Quasi-Saint back.

“Let me see how long you can hold on for!” The Zen Peak Quasi-Saint wiped the blood off his lips. Due to his cultivation, an attack of this level couldn’t inflict any heavy injuries on him. Although he was pushed back, he dashed forth with an even faster speed.

He was in mid-air with flames illuminating the sky. He unleashed countless sword rays when he swung his sword, with each sword ray capable of easily tearing space apart.

Lin Yun immediately wanted to bring out the Great Profound Sword Canon, but he noticed that something wasn’t right, so he forcibly stopped it before circulating the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon to face his opponent, and summoned the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron from the depths of his violet palace. As Lin Yun’s saint aura exploded, he chose offence as a means of defence, ignoring all defences and thrusted his sword, aiming at the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint’s neck.

“You bastard…” The Zen Peak Quasi-Saint cursed, having no choice but to retreat. After the two exchanged over ten-odd moves, their swords clashed together with sparks flying around. The force exerted by them was so great that their swords were knocked away at the same time.

“Saint Soul Radiance!” Zen Peak Quasi-Saint’s eyes lit up as he took this opportunity to clasp his hands together. When he circulated his Saint Soul, the spiritual energy between heaven and earth began to converge with light exploding from his forehead, filling a hundred feet around him.

Within a hundred feet, he was the king of this region. In Lin Yun’s eyes, the world became dark, and the only light source came from Zen Peak Quasi-Saint. At the same time, the strong pressure left fine cracks on his bones.

“Let me see how you die!” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign gritted his teeth, seeing that Zen Peak Quasi-Saint was holding the advantage in the fight.

Everyone took a deep breath because the strength of a Quasi-Saint reaching the Saint Soul Stage of the Heavenly Origin Phase was the Saint Soul. The Saint Soul Radiance was similar to a domain, and it could be considered a fake domain. It would only be transformed into a saint domain after reaching the Saint Realm.

“Ye Qingtian, do you have anything else to say?” Zen Peak Quasi-Saint coldly asked.

Lin Yun bitterly smiled, “What is there for me to say? Didn’t you say three moves? You’ve already released your Saint Soul Radiance.”

“You must be courting death.” Seeing that Lin Yun was still being so arrogant, the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint circulated his saint aura, wanting to suppress Lin Yun. He gritted his teeth with rage blazing in his eyes, and said, “You have already been suppressed by my Saint Soul. You can’t even use your Azure Dragon Divine Physique, not to mention that you don’t have a sword in your hands. So where do you get your confidence to be so stubborn from?!”

The Zen Peak Quasi-Saint was unhappy because he was actually forced to bring out his Saint Soul to deal with someone at the Indigo Origin Phase. Even if he managed to win the battle, it would be an embarrassment. But he could win back some face if he managed to force Lin Yun to reveal himself.

Lin Yun had no change on his face even though he lost the advantage in the fight, and he couldn’t bring out the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. His physique was bearing great pressure. Even his meridians almost became distorted from the pressure.

“Ye Qingtian, stop acting. In just a few minutes, your body will collapse. So reveal yourself and let everyone see your true appearance. I don’t want to kill you,” the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint said coldly.

As murderous intent flashed within Lin Yun’s eyes, he coldly said, “You’re really interesting. You’re speaking as though Flower Burial is a taboo. Furthermore, who told you that I can’t hold on any longer?”

When Lin Yun released his Azure Dragon Sword Heart, a golden sword radiance swept out with a smear of radiance between heaven and earth. The Saint Soul Radiance broke apart, and the pressure disappeared. Lin Yun then waved his hand to bring his sword back into his hand.

This shocked the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint, and he quickly reached out to bring his saint sword back. The two of them were fast as they charged at each other the moment they grabbed their swords. This was a battle with their lives on the line, which depended on whoever dared to risk their life more. This was no longer a battle of cultivation and strength, but a battle between two swordsmen.

The Zen Peak Quasi-Saint was frightened for a moment, while Lin Yun fearlessly dashed forth. Everything happened too quickly. Afterimages overlapped, and blood splashed around.

As Lin Yun’s white robe fluttered in the wind, he held onto the Flower Burial Sword while hovering in the air. “There’s nothing embarrassing about Flower Burial. As long as we have a sword in our hands, anyone can be Flower Burial.”

The Zen Peak Quasi-Saint held onto his neck, and gritted his teeth, “Who the hell are you?!”

“Didn’t I make myself clear? With a sword in hand, anyone can be Flower Burial. I am Flower Burial, burying both people and flowers alike.” Lin Yun raised his head and sheathed his sword. When he completely sheathed his sword, the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint’s head flew away.
