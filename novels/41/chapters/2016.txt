Wang Muyan stopped after she bolted a few thousand miles away. This was because Ye Qingtian made her feel afraid. For a brief moment, she really sensed the murderous intent coming from Ye Qingtian. If she wasn’t careful, Ye Qingtian would probably make a move against her without hesitation.

Not many people could be so heartless. Even if someone wanted to kill her, they would be fooled by her appearance. But to encounter such a ruthless person, she couldn’t help becoming fond of Ye Qingtian.

A bizarre smile rose on Wang Muyan’s lips. It seemed like her intuition was right. Ye Qingtian was the greatest variable within the Heavenly Dao Sect, but she had underestimated him. Bai Qingyu’s betrayal, the death of Xiao Jingyan, and Indigocloth Venerable.

She initially thought that even if those two couldn’t fight Ye Qingtian, it shouldn’t be an issue for them to stay alive. They would probably know Ye Qingtian’s secrets if they were still alive.

Right at this moment, a figure appeared before Wang Muyan. This person was ranked first on the King Ranking, Jin Xuanyi. Jin Xuanyi smiled, “That is the person you want me to deal with? I can kill him easily!”

The two were acquaintances. Wang Muyan no longer looked as fragile as she was at the treehouse inn, and Jin Xuanyi was respectful to her.

“When did I say that I wanted to kill him?” Wang Muyan revealed a charming smile. She licked her lips, making her look even more bewitching in Jin Xuanyi’s eyes. She continued, “I don’t hate him. On the contrary, I’m rather fond of him.

“If you run into him in the arena, spare him,” Wang Muyan said. “If he’s really the same person that I think he is, it’ll be interesting then…”

“You want to subdue him?” Jin Xuanyi caressed Wang Muyan’s hair as he asked in an intoxicated tone.

“What’s the matter? You’re jealous?” Wang Muyan smiled.

“I don’t get jealous of a dead person. I’ll kill him in the arena if he dares to show up. If he doesn’t come, I’ll kill him outside the God Burial Mountain Range,” Jin Xuanyi smiled.

“Where’s the Divine Blood Flower?” Wang Muyan asked.

“Over here.” Jin Xuanyi took out the Divine Blood Flower and gave it to Wang Muyan.

When Wang Muyan took the Divine Blood Flower, excitement blazed within her pupils, before she handed it back to Jin Xuanyi, “Go to Six Holy City and let the arena guard it.”

Jin Xuanyi nodded, before they both left that place.

Lin Yun and Bai Qingyu came to the severed mountain within the secret realm, and the primordial altar was at the center. There were many tiny vines on the altar, emitting gorgeous dao rhythms.

“That’s the Celestial Vine. That’s a rare divine wood, and there’s one here!” Lil’ Purple exclaimed in surprise. The ground was covered with bizarre flowers and towering trees, brimming with vitality.

“Master, I can feel something calling me. It’s coming from the altar,” Bai Qingyu said nervously.

Lil’ Purple stared at the altar and said, “Let’s wait. According to the Blood Crow Ancestor, the Udumbara Flower will show itself upon seeing the Natal Yin Saint Physique. The altar isn’t something good, so don’t be in such a hurry to head over.”

Bai Qingyu nodded while looking nervous, with excitement filling her pupils.

“Lil’ Purple, how can the Udumbara Flower bring someone back to life?” Lin Yun asked.

Lil’ Purple knew that Lin Yun was concerned about this, so she explained, “It’s only a legend, and I’ve only heard of it. But the process might be different compared to what you think.”

“What do you mean?”

“It’s impossible to revive someone who’s already dead. If someone obtained the Udumbara Flower’s seed when he or she was still alive, the Udumbara Flower would bloom at that person’s death, bringing him or her back to life,” Lil’ Purple explained. “You better not hold much hope in it. If it’s in the core of the divine array, it’s best not to touch it. You can just let Flower Burial absorb some of its floral fragrance.”

Lin Yun took a deep breath and said, “When the Southern Emperor wanted to rescue his wife, he spent half of his life doing it. I understand what you mean because bringing someone back from death is too unreal.”

“Master, Big Brother Ye, there’s something there!” Bai Qingyu said.

The moment she said that, the entire place began to tremble as cracks spread across the ground and bizarre flowers flew to the sky. The tremors didn’t last long, and had swiftly calmed down. But the Celestial Vine began to fall off, and the actual appearance of the altar appeared with a powerful saint radiance shining from it.

“It’s really here!” Lil’ Purple exclaimed. But unlike their expectations, the altar only gave off a weak radiance, even after they had waited for a long time. The Udumbara Flower was nowhere to be seen.

“The movements are slow, and there are many golden runes around the altar,” Bai Qingyu said.

“Those are the divine runes,” Lil’ Purple said.

The three waited, watching as the Celestial Vine fell off and melted when it landed on the ground. This made Lin Yun feel pity, and he began to make a move with his hands changing. His mental energy formed into two hands that spread out. This was the Heavenly Silkworm Hands technique that Lil’ Purple taught him, and he used it to pull the Celestial Vine over.

As Lin Yun’s hands began to change, the Celestial Vine formed into a crown, placed it on Lil’ Purple’s head, and injected dragon aura into it through the Blue Dragon Bone. This made the Celestial Vine bloom, and it looked even more beautiful.

“Bells and whistles,” Lil’ Purple said with her lips pouted.

“It’s beautiful! Big Brother Ye, I also want one!” Bai Qingyu said enviously, with her pupils shining brightly.

“Not free. Ask your master to make one for you. She was the one who taught me the Heavenly Silkworm Hands,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Master, look at him!” Bai Qingyu said in a coquettish manner to Lil’ Purple.

“Scumbag, make one for my disciple, or I’ll be angry,” Lil’ Purple said.

Hearing that, Lin Yun smiled and did another one for Bai Qingyu.

Bai Qingyu looked tender to begin with. When she wore the Celestial Vine crown, this added a hint of ethereal air around her. This made her face blush as she happily held onto the crown. She said, “Thank you, Big Brother Ye.”

“It’s coming!” The three could sense a brimming life force coming from the altar, and fine saint rain fell from the sky. As the rain fell, it made the flowers on the ground look even more gorgeous and gave off a faint fog.

Right then, Lil’ Red turned into a shadow and came forth, saying, “Big Brother, many Blood Crows are coming in, and there are a few Blood Crow Kings.”

“Let’s go to the altar.”

Not long after they went to the altar, a crimson cloud gathered over with nine crimson lights shining down from the sky. They gave off a terrifying aura, and their wings gave off a silver radiance. The nine of them were Blood Crow Kings.

Bai Qingyu sat on the ground and closed her eyes. After arriving at the altar, she could feel a deeper connection between her Natal Yin Saint Physique and the Udumbara Flower. As saint radiance shone from her body, it made her look even more gorgeous, and Lin Yun couldn’t help taking a few more glances at her.

Lin Yun said, “You two protect Bai Qingyu. I’ll deal with the Blood Crows.’

“Be careful.”

“Don’t worry.” There were only nine Blood Crow Kings, and Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of them.

“Demon, how dare you kill our ancestor and try to occupy our sacred ground!” A Blood Crow King fiercely looked at Lin Yun.

“Cut the crap and come!” Lin Yun said, holding onto his sword.

“Kill him!” A Blood Crow King gave the order and dashed over, swinging its crimson wings.

Lin Yun stood on the altar and fought the Blood Crow King with the Flower Burial Sword. His sword techniques became profound when he executed the Divine Firefly Sword tecnhique, especially after being empowered with Astral Sword Intent. This only made the phenomena that he created even more massive.

Outside, the altar was covered with sword rays, enveloping the entire area. It didn’t take long for the Blood Crow Kings to have their flesh sliced off and they were only left with bones.

“Demon, you’re pushing it!” This was a great humiliation to the Blood Crow Kings, and this was no different from being shaved bald.

“Get lost if you guys don’t want to die. You guys aren’t my opponent,” Lin Yun said.

There were too many Blood Crows; it would be troublesome if they all came at him together.

“Let’s attack the demon together!” The Blood Crow Kings flocked over, charging at Lin Yun together. At the same time, many Blood Crows also dove down from the sky.

“We can’t let him leave. We must kill him today, no matter what!”

“Take revenge for our ancestor!” The Blood Crows flocked over with their baleful energy gathering over.

Lin Yun no longer held back and released his Azure Dragon Sword Heart and the silver radiance he gave off enveloped the entire altar. As he executed the Divine Firefly Sword technique, afterimages covered the entire altar before clashing head-on with the nine Blood Crows.

Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red also made their moves, killing the Blood Crows who got close to Bai Qingyu. But there were too many. The entire Blood Crow Tribe within the Myriad Graves Valley was here.

Since the nine Blood Crow Kings have joined hands, Lin Yun couldn’t find the opportunity to kill them. The Azure Dragon Sword Heart wasn’t a genuine Sword Domain and could only intimidate the nine Blood Crow Kings. He couldn’t stop there at all.

An hour later, there was a loophole in the silver radiance, and the nine Blood Crow Kings caught this opportunity to charge into the altar.

“Not good!” Lil’ Purple’s face changed because there were too many Blood Crows, and they would be swarmed if this continued.

“I’ll lure them away!” Lin Yun fought a Blood Crow King back, then had the Golden Crow Wings unfold behind him. But just when he was about to leave, a sword ray flashed on the altar, beheading the nine Blood Crow Kings.

When Lin Yun turned around, wanting to see who made that move, he couldn’t see anyone else.

“This familiar aura… Is it him…?” Lil’ Purple muttered with doubt filling her pupils.
