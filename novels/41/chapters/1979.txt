Chapter 1980 - Who's The One Pretending...

While Young Master Wushuang was showing off, Lin Yun reached the minuscule stage of the Myriad Swords Unite at Remorse Cliff. The minuscule stage was above the manifestation stage. Thirteen figures flew out from Lin Yun around Remorse Cliff, perfectly drawing a circle.

Unlike in the past, the ten-odd different phenomena were fusing together. When Lin Yun drew his sword, his sword intent enveloped the entire Remorse Cliff. When he thrust his sword, it was like a powerful explosion, with the surrounding air shattering like a mirror into countless fragments.

“This move again.” Bai Xiao frowned outside Remorse Cliff. He had to admit that Ye Qingtian was a genius swordsman. He had been practicing the Myriad Swords Unite over the past few days and had made swift progress. Now, he could control his sword as he wished, making Bai Xiao feel a chill run down his spine.

“Dustless Palace.” When he heard the zither music, Lin Yun sheathed his sword and raised his head to look towards the Dustless Palace. He asked, “Has the banquet begun?”

“What’s the matter?” Bai Xiao concealed the shock within his heart and smiled, “Don’t tell me you really think that you’re Flower Burial? Don’t even think about it. You’re unworthy.”

“What am I unworthy of? Unworthy of Bai Shuying, being compared to Flower Burial, or clashing with Young Master Wushuang?” Lin Yun smiled.

Bai Xiao was startled because Ye Qingtian seemed more transparent today and gave off a powerful aura. But Bai Xiao still bit the bullet and said, “All of them.”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Big Brother Bai, you said you won’t stop me if I can leave here myself?” Lin Yun asked.

Bai Xiao raised his brow, not knowing what Ye Qingtian was planning. He said, “I only said that if Flower Burial was in the Nether Orchid Sword Array, the array can’t trap him.”

“So, have you said it before?” Lin Yun asked.

“I-I guess…” Bai Xiao said in a guilty tone.

Lin Yun sighed before he smiled, “Actually, I’ve been hesitating if I should go, and I still don’t have an answer yet. There are times in the world when something cannot be cut with one sword.”

“Then, don’t go out,” Bai Xiao said. He was feeling a little guilty. He did say that he wouldn’t stop Ye Qingtian if he could leave by himself. But if Ye Qingtian really left, he would have to be blamed for it.

But Lin Yun didn’t hear what he said, and his face gradually became cold, “I still don’t know if I should leave. But I’m clear on one thing. Who the hell is that, Young Master Wushuang? Is he qualified, then?”

Bai Xiao’s face soon changed, and he was shocked to see that the surrounding Nether Orchids were withering.

“There’s no need to hurry. We can play one at a time.” Young Master Wushuang, whose name was Nie Wushuang, said. His tone was calm, but what he said was cocky. This was the same as saying that he wasn’t targeting any one individual but everyone.

“Let me face him!” Just when the Heavenly Dao Sect’s party became furious, a lightning bolt flashed, and a person appeared before the plaza. This person was Ouyang He. He was third on the Dragon Pulse Ranking two decades ago and was proficient in lightning dao. His cultivation had been at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage not too long ago.

Now that he was at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, his nirvana aura was terrifying, despite not having a high cultivation. He was notorious for being ruthless within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and many saint disciples at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage were afraid of him.

“Are you sure about that? I’m afraid I might hurt you,” Nie Wushuang said with an ‘amicable’ smile.

“Is that so? What about now?” Ouyang He smiled, and lightning began to flash within his palm. The lightning reached over a thousand feet, illuminating the entire plaza.

“Sixth-Grade Lightning Intent!” Everyone was shocked, and they instantly knew where Ouyang He’s confidence came from.

But Nie Wushuang shook his head and smiled, “Consider it my loss if you can get within ten steps of me.”

Everyone felt that Nie Wushuang was too arrogant. Even if he came from a musical clan, it made no sense for him to be that strong.

“You think too much!” Ouyang He’s face became dark, and he released lightning pressure, causing the sky to change.

Thunder began to rumble throughout the plaza, but Nie Wushuang was calm as he strummed the zither, and the note actually suppressed Ouyang He’s lightning. But that wasn’t all, Nie Wushuang shut his eyes to play an ancient song, Merciless.

A thundrous rumble echoed throughout the plaza, and everyone was shocked to see that Ouyang He was approaching, enveloped in lightning.

“As expected of Ouyang He. He might not have high cultivation, but it’s rare for someone’s martial intent to reach his height at such a young age.” Everyone looked at Ouyang He. They wanted to see his true strength.

Ouyang He slowly approached under everyone’s gazes, and he wasn’t hindered by Nie Wushuang’s music at all. With the empowerment of his nirvana aura, the lightning phenomena became even more terrifying as countless purple streams formed into dragons, roaring as Ouyang He approached.

Nie Wushuang reacted as though he didn’t sense it. His eyes were closed, and he was focused on playing his music. But no one noticed the white mist coming from his fingers, and the murderous intent was accumulating like a volcano.

“Ouyang He stopped!” Everyone was shocked to discover that Ouyang He couldn’t take another step forth when he was almost ten steps away from Nie Wushuang as though an invisible barrier was stopping him.

As the two powers clashed, the rumbling thunder became even louder, and a terrifying aura enveloped the entire plaza.

The Divine Dao Pavilion’s disciples sneered while the Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples were shocked. Was this where Nie Wushuang’s confidence came from?

Ouyang He frowned because he could sense that he was blocked. He initially wanted to immediately suppress Nie Wushuang and interrupt his music. At that time, Nie Wushuang would be embarrassed, regardless if he won or lost. But he couldn’t take another step forth, no matter how he tried. Nie Wushuang’s music sounded as though it contained magic and was even more terrifying than his lightning.

When Nie Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes, he was like a Buddha from hell, and his smile could subdue all the evil spirits in the world. With a flick of his finger, the music note left a massive crack in the thunderclouds, with sunlight shining down from the crack. When he strummed the zither strings once more, a crimson streak flew out. His murderous intent was entirely condensed within it, and Ouyang He’s phenomenon crumbled when they came in contact.

“H-How is this possible?!” Ouyang He’s face changed.

But that wasn’t all, every strum of the zither strings would release a crimson streak. When Nie Wushuang increased his speed, it felt like he was throwing a barrage of weapons at Ouyang He.

Multiple wounds appeared on Ouyang He’s body before he was sent flying out, throwing out a mouthful of blood as he crashed against a table. No matter how he tried, he couldn’t even get up.

“A song of Merciless to purge all monsters,” Nie Wushuang smiled, and the plaza fell silent. He looked in the Heavenly Dao Sect’s direction, and the smile on his face made everyone feel suffocating as he said, “Let’s continue.”

Everyone felt that Nie Wushuang was too terrifying. Ouyang He stopped before he could get within ten steps of him.

“It looks like fifteen steps is too difficult for you guys. How about this, I’ll surrender if anyone can take thirty steps near me. You guys can even come at me together, if you want,” Nie Wushuang smiled.

“He’s too much!”

“He’s too cocky!”

“Does he think the Heavenly Dao Sect has no one?”

“Isn’t it just music dao? I don’t believe I can’t do it!” The Heavenly Dao Sect’s saint disciples were furious after being belittled, and more people stepped out.

“Great!” Nie Wushuang laughed and continued to play Merciless. This time, he had fully released his murderous intent and was enveloped in a crimson radiance. It didn’t take long for him to win eight rounds in a row. When he defeated another person, Nie Wushuang slammed his palms on the zither, sending everyone flying away before they could even step forth. At the same time, a powerful murderous intent swept out from him.

Nie Wushuang smiled, “Anyone else?”

The surroundings fell silent, and no one dared to speak. Wang Yue looked anxious with his right fist clenched, and his face was filled with indignance. He muttered, “Ye Qingtian, are you really not coming?”

Everyone couldn’t help turning to look at Ye Qinghong, Bai Yizhou, and Zhang Kui. Those three were the strongest amongst the younger generation present, and they could definitely teach Nie Wushuang a lesson if they made a move. But they had already formed a deal with Nie Wushuang and disregarded the surrounding gazes. This naturally made everyone furiously grit their teeth, but they could do nothing about it.

“Who’s the one pretending… I mean, playing the zither? Why don’t I also listen to it?” A voice resounded as a figure landed on the roof in the plaza. This person wore an indolent and playful smile.
