Chapter 941 - Gold-furred Demonic Ape

Ten divine astral pellets were comparable to a hundred thousand astral pellets in value. After all, no one would be willing to trade a hundred thousand or even a million astral pellets for divine astral pellets. After all, divine astral pellets had a price without value.

The astral energy contained in the divine astral pellet had been refined by astral flame, so the effects of using them to temper their bodies were incomparable to astral pellets.

“I meant ten pellets each, not ten pellets for the both of you,” said Lin Yun calmly. “Information about monarch demonic beasts is extremely important to me, so you guys have to obtain it no matter what. Also pay attention to those experts on the ranking for me, along with information about the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.”

What Lin Yun said left Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong dumbfounded because they never expected that Lin Yun would be so generous.

“Although I don’t think that you guys will leak my tracks, I still have to give you guys a heads up first.” Lin Yun then directed his cold gaze onto Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong.

In that split second, Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong’s faces changed and could feel that their bodies were penetrated by Lin Yun’s sword intent. As long as Lin Yun wanted, he could solidify that sword intent any time and tear him into pieces. This caused fear to spread out in their hearts and they were covered in a cold sweat.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Just what kind of sword intent that was? That was simply too terrifying! They had no idea how Lin Yun did that as they became even more terrified.

“Let’s go. I’ll be waiting for you guys here. This is the deposit.” Lin Yun removed his sword intent and took out ten divine astral pellets before tossing them to Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen. This made them feel relieved before they were both stunned by the dazzling golden flames on the divine astral pellets.

They knew that these were genuine divine astral pellets. They were hardly found in the Azure Dragon Region and even they had only heard about it. This was still their first time seeing it. It was rumoured that the Azure Dragon Ranking had seven heads and were the strongest in the Azure Dragon Region because the geniuses of their realms excavated many divine astral pellets.

Judging from how generous Lin Yun was, Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong speculated that Lin Yun’s harvest was even more than the seven heads.

“Don’t worry. We will definitely return with the information you need…” Xian Yunzhen smiled with lingering fear. “We were there when you killed Kong Xuan. So we naturally don’t have the guts to do it.”

“That’s for the best,” replied Lin Yun, nodding his head. It didn’t take long for the two to disappear before them and headed towards the city. Lin Yun had always been a cautious person, so he naturally wouldn’t believe them easily. As a precaution, his gaze fell onto Lil’ Red who was on his shoulder. With the Void Blade in its hand, it was a lot easier for it to hide compared to Lin Yun.

Lin Yun and Lil’ Red had come a long way here, so it instantly knew what Lin Yun meant with a glance. Quietly, Lil’ Red turned into a blur and secretly followed behind those two.

It would take some time for them to gather information, so Lin Yun sat down and started refining divine astral pellets. With the divine astral pellets, Lin Yun could sense that he was making swift progress in his cultivation. Now, his cultivation had already stabilized in the lesser first soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

Aside from that, the greatest change would be the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra as it had touched the threshold of the tenth stage. The Azure Firmament Sword Sutra only had ten stages in total. If he could reach the pinnacle tenth stage, this meant that the Three Heavenly Rends’ power would reach a new height.

Previously when his sword intent made a breakthrough, the entire sky was covered by the Azure Firmament Tree and Iris Flowers when the sword descended from the gate. This had brought a great impact on Lin Yun and also motivated him, even more, to bring the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra to the tenth stage.

Pairing it with his sky sword intent, it might be able to unleash a shocking power. Roughly six hours later, Lin Yun could sense two familiar aura approaching as they were Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen. They came back faster than he had expected, and it appears that their trip should be smooth.

Lin Yun opened his eyes and kept the half-devoured divine astral pellet into his interspatial pouch before he stood up. Not long later, Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen appeared before Lin Yun.

“We’ve found the information you need. As many people are scouting the entire forbidden region every day, it’s easy to find information about monarch demonic beasts. So what cultivation are you looking at?” Chen Qiong asked after letting out a breath. But the moment he was done, a black figure flew across their heads and landed on Lin Yun’s shoulder.

Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen instantly saw the Dragon-blooded Cat. Although there weren’t any changes on their faces, their hearts had sunken. They were both feeling fortunate that they were looking for information honestly.

Lin Yun might seem arrogant, but he also had meticulous thoughts which left a chill down their spines.

“Third soul Heavenly Soul Realm,” said Lin Yun calmly. Monarch demonic beasts in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm were already dangerous. So the odds of Lin Yun winning against a fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast wasn’t high.

After all, overlord demonic beasts could suppress human cultivators of the same realm and monarch demonic beasts were practically invincible among the same cultivation.

“Gold-furred Demonic Ape, a descendant of the Ancient Dracoape. As it had devoured a yang-attributed fruit, its bloodline had undergone a transformation. So this fits your requirement perfectly,” said Chen Qiong after calming himself down.

Beside him, Xian Yunzhen added, “But the Blazeyang Realm’s leader is also interested in this Gold-furred Demonic Ape and even gathered six higher realms to hunt it. The Blazeyang Realm might not be comparable to Bloodbone Realm, but the strength of their leader, Mo Yan, was even stronger than Kong Xuan. Furthermore, the six higher realms he recruited weren’t weak either.”

“I heard that his Flameyang Art had already reached the pinnacle with deep attainments in flame intent. So he’s trying to use a monarch beast core to make a breakthrough in his flame intent.” Chen Qiong looked at Lin Yun solemnly and added, “He’s not someone easy to mess with.”

This Mo Yang was indeed impressive that he could cultivate the flame intent to the pinnacle second stage. But it was a pity because it was nothing compared to Lin Yun’s sword intent. Out of all the martial intents, sword and sabre intents were the strongest, not to mention that Lin Yun had even merged the immortal azure dragon intent into it. So even if he didn’t use his sky sword intent, he was confident that he could suppress him with his martial intent alone. The only trouble would be the six higher realms.

Xian Yunzhen continued, “Unlike Kong Xuan who had just reached the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm, he had already reached the greater third soul Heavenly Soul Realm. I heard that he even used six million astral pellets in his tribulation.”

If it was the past, Mo Yan would be a formidable opponent. But now that Lin Yun had absorbed a thousand five hundred divine astral pellets in his first tribulation, it was the same as having a foundation of a thousand five hundred divine astral pellets.

“Alright, I got it.” Lin Yun didn’t talk much about it and continued to enquire about Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s location along with some other information.

The two told them about what they found and also reminded Lin Yun that Bloodbone Realm’s leader was undergoing his fourth tribulation to deal with him in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. The Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm would start two months from now. At that time, all the geniuses from the Azure Dragon Region would be gathered there and even geniuses from the other realms.

“Found anything about Yue Weiwei?” Lin Yun asked.

Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong exchanged a glance before they shook their heads, “None.”

Lin Yun no longer asked when he heard that. Looks like Yue Weiwei’s trouble wasn’t simple that not even Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong couldn’t come in contact with.

Xian Yunzhen hesitated briefly and said, “There’s one more piece of information that you might be interested in. The Glorymoon Spirit is taken by someone also from the Profound Amber Realm. His name is Yu Haotian!”

Lin Yun was surprised to hear that. He never imagined that Yu Haotian was still alive and even took the Glorymoon Spirit. This also meant that Yu Haotian could confront the higher realms' geniuses with his strength. Just what did he experience in this period of time?

But there was something Lin Yun could be sure about. This meant that the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm would be interesting. Not only Yu Haotian would be there, but Bloodbone Realm’s leader might even reach the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm along with that mysterious lady. Not to mention the seven heads of the Azure Dragon Ranking. When the forbidden realm opens, even Lin Yun had no idea how chaotic it would become.

Both Xuan Yunzhen and Chen Qiong were surprised to see the changes on Lin Yun’s face. After all, Lin Yun’s face didn’t even change hearing how strong Mo Yan was or Bloodbone Realm’s leader undergoing his fourth tribulation soon. But Lin Yun’s face had changed when he heard about Yu Haotian.

“That's important to me. Farewell.” Lin Yun recollected his thoughts before throwing the remaining ten divine astral pellets over.

Looking at Lin Yun’s figure, Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong’s faces became complicated. Chen Qiong asked, “Yunzhen, what rank do you think Lin Yun can obtain with his current strength?”

There was a threshold in the Azure Dragon Ranking and it would only be higher as time passed. The current threshold was the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. So there was naturally no way Lin Yun could make it in with his current cultivation. But it was an undeniable fact that he had killed Kong Xuan, ranked forty-seventh on the Azure Dragon Ranking.

Xian Yunzhen pondered briefly and said, “Probably comparable to the top thirty. As long as no one from the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm steps out, it’s hard for anyone to suppress him.”

The Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s location was pretty far from Lin Yun. But fortunately, with Lil’ Red around, the entire journey became much shorter. In just roughly an hour’s time, a mountain range had already appeared before Lin Yun. The mountain range was enveloped in an eerie fog that contained fatal poison. So aside from higher realms, no one would dare to step into this region.

“This is the Ashes Mountain Range?” Lin Yun looked down from Lil’ Red’s back and saw that the entrance was sealed off. It looks like Mo Yan was pretty determined to take the Gold-furred Demonic Ape down. But the mountain range was massive, and it was practically impossible for this many people to seal off the entire mountain range. He could easily find some paths with no one guarding them.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun’s figure flashed and landed on the ground firmly. When Lil’ Red transformed into its cat form, they both entered the mountain range. In their eyes, the demonic beasts here were just appetizers.
