Chapter 1689 – Sovereign Saint Artifact, Heavenly Origin Mirror

The saint elders on the stage shook their heads and couldn’t be bothered to pursue this anymore. Mu Xueling’s face was still as indifferent as before, but she clearly didn’t believe it either because she didn’t say a word.

“Saint Elder, I’m practically confident that this person is Lin Yun! He has ulterior motives by disguising himself in my Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. We have to be cautious of him!” But Elder Jiang was confident that Lin Yun was playing psychological warfare with them.

“Elder Jiang Yu, you want me to use the Heavenly Origin Mirror?” Mu Xueling asked.

“There’s no need to go through so much trouble. I just have to trouble Saint Elder to seal my cultivation at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm!” Jiang Yu smiled.

“Elder Jiang, there’s no way he can be Lin Yun. So don’t bother.”

“Yeah. Isn’t he courting death to come to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion if he’s Lin Yun?”

“You think Saint Elder can’t see through him if he’s under a disguise?” The elders were persuaded, feeling that Jiang Yu was too obsessed. After all, Lin Xiao merely gave Liu Feng a beating.

Although everyone knew the relationship between Liu Feng and Jiang Wan’er, they didn’t think that there was a need for Jiang Yu to accuse Lin Xiao of being Lin Yun. Mu Xueling was a Quasi-Saint, and it was easy for her to seal Jiang Yu’s cultivation if she wanted. So she briefly pondered before she tapped her finger on Jiang Yu’s forehead.

As light bloomed on her finger, wisps of saint dao poured into Jiang Yu’s body, and his cultivation swiftly fell to the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

“What are they trying to do?” Jiang Wan’er asked.

“Probably wanting to probe his strength.” Liu Feng said with a slight change on his face. Despite saying that, he didn’t think Lin Xiao was Lin Yun. If the latter really was Lin Yun, his beating would be in vain, not to mention that he didn’t wish to admit in his heart that Lin Xiao was that strong.

As Jiang Yu looked at Lin Yun, he said, “Lin Xiao, do you dare to say that you’re not proficient in the sword?”

“I never said I don’t know how to use the sword. I have some superficial knowledge of using the sword, and I’ve already admitted that I’m Lin Yun. What else do you want?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hahaha!” Jiang Yu laughed. “The disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint says that his knowledge of using the sword is superficial? Let me expose your true appearance today! My cultivation is the same as yours. So fight me without using a sword, if you have the guts!”

“Geezer, are you sure about that?” Lin Yun smiled with his eyes squinted.

“You bastard! How dare you call my father a geezer!” Jiang Wan’er was unhappy with how disrespectful Lin Yun was towards her father.

“Lass, I’m afraid that your father will take a beating. After all, I’m a barbarian and I don’t know how to hold back my strength.” Lin Yun smiled with his brow raised.

“You bastard!” Jiang Wan’er was furious, seeing how arrogant Lin Yun was.

“Wan’er, don’t stoop to his level.” Liu Feng said with his head swollen.

“Who are you? If you’re willing to share your identity, I promise I won’t let anyone make things difficult for you.” Mu Xueling said with a grave expression as she looked at Lin Yun.

“Didn’t I already say that I’m Lin Yun?” Lin Yun’s laughter was arrogant, which made everyone who heard him furrow their brows. After all, Lin Xiao was too despicable, daring to speak to Saint Elder in this manner.

“Saint Elder, we’ll know who he is after testing his strength!” Jiang Yu laughed and dashed toward Lin Yun. His main cultivation was in the music dao, but he was still an expert at the Nirvana Stage. Even if his cultivation was suppressed to the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, he was still a terrifying opponent.

As his boundless dragon origin surged out of his body, it caused a wind to rise on the Saint Altar and the surrounding temperature fell. It didn’t take long for all the flowers in the surroundings to be covered with a layer of frost and withered.

His five fingers became pale, with scales appearing on his fingers, looking like the sharp claws of an ice-attributed demonic beast. This shocked everyone because that was the Frost Intent at the fifth grade. This alarmed everyone. After all, even if Jiang Yu’s cultivation was restricted, his martial intent wasn’t.

“Young Master Lin, be careful!” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi’s faces changed, and they both became nervous.

“Good!” Lin Yun smiled. Raising his hand, he took Jiang Yu’s attack head-on.

Along with a collision, Lin Yun took three steps back. After all, Jiang Yu was at the pinnacle of the Samsara Edict Realm, not to mention that the latter used his fifth-grade Frost Intent behind his attack, and that strike from Jiang Yu was a little terrifying.

After Jiang Yu unleashed his first attack, he began to flicker around in the air like a ghost, and his claws were like arrows shooting towards Lin Yun. But Lin Yun didn’t panic when he saw Jiang Yu’s attacks. He noticed that despite having a high cultivation and martial intent, Jiang Yu didn’t seem to have much experience in an actual fight.

Jiang Yu’s attacks might seem powerful, but he could tell they were filled with flaws without using the Divine Dragon Eyes.

But Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to retaliate because he was waiting for Jiang Yu to reveal a more significant flaw. Thus, he strolled through Jiang Yu’s attacks as though he had a pair of eyes at the back of his head, avoiding all Jiang Yu’s attacks.

But in the eyes of others, it looked as though Lin Yun was being suppressed by Jiang Yu, placing him in a dangerous position. When everyone saw this scene, even they felt that Jiang Yu was a little too much. It was clear that Lin Xiao wasn’t Lin Yun, and Jiang Yu was taking revenge on purpose.

“Elder Jiang has taken it a little too far…”

“It will look bad on our Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion if this gets out.” The other elders spoke out on the Saint Altar, occasionally turning to look at Mu Xueling, wanting the latter to stop Jiang Yu.

But Mu Xueling didn’t say a word. Her facial expression was still as indifferent as before, and no one could see through what she was thinking. In reality, Mu Xueling was a little curious because she could sense that Lin Yun had grasped sword intent when he fought Liu Feng earlier.

The Azure Dragon Saint Physique might be rare, but others also possessed it. On the other hand, it was too much of a coincidence for someone to possess both the Azure Dragon Saint Physique and sword intent. But since Lin Yun didn’t use his sword intent, Mu Xueling was confident in herself as a Quasi-Saint. It’s just that she had no idea how strong Lin Yun’s sword intent was.

“Flower Burial, you’re not going to use your sword? Don’t blame me for being ruthless, then!” Jiang Yu’s face sank, seeing that Lin Yun did not draw his sword throughout the whole fight. He no longer held back and multiple afterimages appeared, each pushing out a palm that pressed down.

Before his attack reached Lin Yun, the ground beneath Lin Yun’s feet started to crack, with a terrifying chill spreading out. Jiang Yu’s fifth-grade Frost Intent was powerful, creating waves of frightening chill that were trying to penetrate Lin Yun’s body. As Lin Yun’s body became stiff, a layer of ice soon covered his body, and anyone could tell he was about to turn into an ice statue.

“No!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Elder Jiang, hold your hand!”

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi became anxious. After all, Lin Yun was their savior. They initially wanted to repay their favor to Lin Yun by bringing him to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, but Lin Yun might lose his life instead, judging from the current fight. They would definitely blame themselves if Lin Yun lost his life.

But Jiang Yu couldn’t be bothered and seemed confident about Lin Xiao being Lin Yun. If Lin Xiao was Lin Yun, he could easily break through the ice with his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, and he didn’t believe Lin Yun would dare to risk his life.

As a cold light flashed across Jiang Yu’s pupils, he unleashed his attack without holding back. But just when his palm was about to descend, the layer of ice covering Lin Yun shattered with golden light shining within his pupils. At this moment, he had pushed his Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art to the limit. As the layer of ice shattered, the fragments flew out like arrows.

With his clothes and hair fluttering violently, Lin Yun was like an awakened divine dragon at this moment. He had been waiting for this moment. Taking a step forth, he raised his hand and a hundred thousand dragon runes paired with his Thunderstorm Intent. When he reached out with his hand, his hand was like a dragon claw as it streaked over.

Not good! Jiang Yu was inwardly shocked because he had never imagined Lin Yun’s Thunderstorm Intent would be so terrifying. But it was already too late for him to retreat now.

Lin Yun quickly grabbed a hold of Jiang Yu’s wrist and slightly exerted some force, shattering the layer of ice enveloping Jiang Yu.

“Let me go!” Jiang Yu roared. But it was futile, despite how he struggled with his cultivation that was suppressed to the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. At this moment, he wanted to forcibly break through the restriction and kill Lin Yun with a palm.

But Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t care what Jiang Yu said and held onto Jiang Yu’s wrist before slamming him against the ground back and forth like a ragdoll.

This left everyone dumbfounded, including the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples and the elders who had spoken out against Lin Yun earlier. Only Mu Xueling’s face maintained its indifference as she watched the fight.

“Let go of my father!” Jiang Wan’er became anxious when she saw this scene and dashed forth, throwing everything to the back of her mind.

“Woman, you’re playing with fire.” Lin Yun smiled while shaking his head. He let go of Jiang Yu before giving him a frontal kick that sent Jiang Yu flying towards Jiang Wan’er.

“Wan’er, watch out!” Liu Feng became anxious because Jiang Wan’er would be heavily injured if they collided.

But that scene didn’t happen since Mu Xueling reached out and pulled Jiang Yu back to her side. A few elders stepped forth to examine Jiang Yu’s injuries as the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion fell silent. Everyone’s gazes were shocked as they looked at Lin Yun, and they couldn’t utter a single word. They never expected him to be so ruthless as to give the Grand Elder a beating when he had just joined the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

“Saint Elder, he’s Lin Yun! He’s definitely Lin Yun! Lin Yun possesses a Divine Dragon Bone; you’ll know by touching him!” Jiang Yu emotionally said as he kept throwing out blood.

Lin Yun’s response was pretty direct as he pulled his clothes apart, revealing his upper chest. This scene instantly made many female disciple’s faces blush. But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered as he looked at Mu Xueling and smiled, raising his brow, “Saint Elder, come and have a touch!”

This scene made Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi’s faces blush. But many female disciples couldn’t help peeking at Lin Yun out of curiosity. On the other hand, Jiang Yu was awkward because he never expected Lin Yun to be so shameless.

“Saint Elder, I don’t mean it that way…” Jiang Yu quickly explained.

“There’s no need to be so troublesome.” Mu Xueling stood up and released her aura. As the surroundings fell silent, Mu Xueling said, “Heavenly Origin Mirror!”

As the heavens shattered, an ancient mirror descended from the sky and hovered above the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. When a powerful aura swept out, all thirty-six mountains were shaken.

Even Lin Yun couldn’t help but panic because he could recognize that this was a Sovereign Saint Artifact. Mu Chuan said that even a saint wouldn’t be able to see through the Divine Tortoise Transformation, but he didn’t say if it also worked against a Sovereign Saint Artifact.
