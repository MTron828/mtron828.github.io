Chapter 1003 - Possession!

Empowered by his sky sword intent, Lin Yun’s Divine Glorysun Sword was astonishing. When the golden energy poured into the sword, the Flower Burial Sword grew into a gigantic sword ray. A single swing of his sword sent countless golden rays exploding at Yu Haotian.

There was a huge difference between Yu Haotian and Lin Yun, but the demonic spirit had the means to push Yu Haotian’s strength to a height that gave Lin Yun a headache. Plus, the demonic moon hanging in the sky caused space to distort, which restricted Lin Yun’s movement technique and cultivation. If he didn’t have the Astral Demonic Flowers in his aura oceans, he would have been completely suppressed.

Lin Yun stopped wasting time and tore the distorted space apart with his sky sword intent. Cracks began to appear in space as Lin Yun’s sword sent Yu Haotian flying over a few hundred meters.

When the demonic spirit raised his head to see space being torn apart, his eyes flashed with anxiety, “Damn it! Phaseless Demonic Art—Berserk Demonic Dance!”

Letting out a roar, Yu Haotian’s hands surged with demonic aura and unleashed countless demonic beams that formed tentacles.

The tentacles emitted a rotten stench that could stain anyone’s soul. It wasn’t something that could be resisted, especially if one was captured by the tentacle. If Lin Yun got caught, the demonic light would penetrate his body and inflict heavy injuries. Clearly, this was one of the demonic spirit’s strongest attacks meant to resist Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Art.

“What pitiful tricks! Eastern Purple Aura!” Lin Yun released a golden brilliance from his pupils and the wings of the golden winged human began to blaze with flames. When he swung his sword out, Lin Yun looked like a golden crow as purple light shined from the golden sword ray. The brightness even shook heaven and earth.

In the path of Lin Yun’s sword ray, all the demonic tentacles broke into pieces because Lin Yun’s sky sword intent was too strong. Everyone’s hearts trembled at this sight because their souls felt fear from Lin Yun’s sword.

“Divine Glorysun Fist? Divine Glorysun Sword?” Luo Chen and Qin Lin jaws dropped in disbelief. A fist technique could be performed with a sword? It was simply unimaginable. It was unheard of!

“N-n-no!” Looking at the tentacles being destroyed, the demonic spirit screamed out in fear. The power of the Divine Glorysun Sword empowered by sky sword intent had far surpassed his imagination. But before he could recover from his shock, Lin Yun released a dazzling brilliance with his sword once more. His sword dyed the entire sky in golden flames, destroying most of the demonic tentacles.

The golden flames were filled with vitality and made Lin Yun look like a deity from the sun. His hair, clothes, and the mark on his forehead were shining brightly as he displayed the power of his sky sword intent.

Although Yu Haotian tried his best to resist, he was still sent flying away. Additionally, a brittle sound came from his Divine Shadow Glove. Everyone could hear a ghastly howl coming from the glove as its astral flames died.

Pain could be seen on Yu Haotian’s face as his vitality was sapped by the Divine Shadow Glove. This was a sign that he was over-exhausting himself to use the glove. Clearly, he couldn’t hold on much longer. But the demonic spirit wasn’t bothered by it as it still tried to use the glove to attack Lin Yun.

“N-no! Senior, my physique can’t hold on much longer!” Yu Haotian’s soul screamed out because the demonic spirit didn’t care about his physique at all. Earlier, when the demonic spirit used the Phaseless Demonic Art to recover Yu Haotian’s injuries, Yu Haotian’s foundation was injured. Now that he suffered the backlash from the Divine Shadow Glove, Yu Haotian’s physique was like a half-cripple. There was no way Yu Haotian could fully recover with his foundation injured. How could he not be anxious?

“Hmph! Cut the crap!” The demonic spirit snorted and continued to utilize the Divine Shadow Glove. This pushed Yu Haotian’s physique to the limit, which drained his body of all color.

“Stop!” Yu Haotian flew into a rage and tried to compete for control over his body. As Yu Haotian’s face continued to change, the astral flames on the Divine Shadow Glove also started flickering.

“What impudence! This much is nothing as long as I can obtain that bone. That’s a true bone left behind by an Azure Dragon King. If you dare to interfere with me again, I’ll annihilate you!” The demonic spirit flew into rage and sent Yu Haotian’s soul flying.

This scared Yu Haotian to the point of not daring to make a move again. He could only wait and gnash his teeth. There was nothing he could do to the demonic spirit until he received control of his body once more. He was furious from humiliation. It was fine if the demonic spirit could kill Lin Yun, but the demonic spirit was clearly blinded by the Azure Dragon True Bone.

This filled Yu Haotian with fear because he knew that his outcome wouldn’t be good even if the demonic spirit managed to kill Lin Yun. At this moment, his hatred for the demonic spirit had far exceeded his hatred for Lin Yun. Although he was cautious, he never expected that the demonic spirit would treat him like a slave.

While Yu Haotian fought the demonic spirit for the control of his body, a golden winged human unfolded its wings behind Lin Yun. Then, a sword appeared in the hand of the winged human as it swung the sword to match Lin Yun’s movements, “Three Seals Combined — Divine Sun Annihilation!”

A gigantic sword ray exploded from the Flower Burial Sword and pierced a hole in the demonic clouds. As Lin Yun’s hair began to flutter in the wind, he emitted a sacred aura like the sun and swung his sword down, “This is the end!”

The power behind this sword was too terrifying and caught the demonic spirit by surprise. It even sliced the demonic moon in half. Then, the demonic spirit broke into countless pieces. When the remaining power of the sword landed on Yu Haotian, Yu Haotian threw up a mouthful of blood. This made the demonic spirit panic and try to escape.

But before he could escape, Lin Yun sheathed his sword with killing intent brimming from his pupils, “You think you can escape?”

Forming seals with his hands to execute the Golden Crow Nine Transformation, his origin energy turned golden and poured towards his back. When the seal was formed, a pair of golden wings bloomed on Lin Yun’s back.

“Come back!” The golden wings instantly restricted Yu Haotian, who had run far away, before pulling him back to Lin Yun. Prepared for this, Lin Yun threw the Divine Sun Breaking Seal at Yu Haotian.

When Lin Yun’s punch landed on Yu Haotian, his attack heavily injured the demonic spirit’s foundation. The demonic spirit released a painful howl within Yu Haotian’s body. When the demonic spirit’s aura began to die down, the eyes of Yu Haotian’s eyes shined coldly. He had been preparing for a long time and decisively made his move the moment he saw that the demonic spirit was injured, “Old fogey, get out!”

“You ingrate! I know that you’re helpless!” The demonic spirit began to curse at Yu Haotian.

“Don’t blame me for being ungrateful!” Yu Haotian sneered. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Haha, you were just a piece of trash, to begin with. You would have been killed by Lin Yun without my help. As for your physique, it’s not even comparable to a dog right now. I’ll deal with you after I possess that brat’s body!” The demonic spirit flew out of Yu Haotian’s body. This left Yu Haotian in rage because the demonic spirit had clearly treated him as an abandoned chess piece right from the start.

After Lin Yun retracted his fist, he quickly retreated because he saw a demonic light flying towards him. But the demonic light was too fast and shot into his forehead before Lin Yun could increase his speed. The demonic spirit wanted to possess Lin Yun’s body!
