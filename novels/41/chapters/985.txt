Chapter 986 - Mountains and Rivers Can Be Suppressed, But Not Lin Yun!

Lin Yun’s words made Mu Xiuhan’s group angry. The three of them were famous figures in the Azure Dragon Region who stood at the top of the rankings. They were even a bit famous in the Heavenly Path.

Naturally, they had a deep sense of pride, so didn’t want to join hands to face Lin Yun. After all, they looked down on Lin Yun and had concerns about their reputation. If they did this, they would be a laughingstock in the eyes of geniuses from the other regions.

But now, they knew that Lin Yun wasn’t a pushover, especially since Feng Xuanyi died from a single punch. It was impossible to say that the three of them wouldn’t join hands because even a fool could tell that Lin Yun wasn’t a pushover. Now that they got over their mindset, their killing intent began to surge.

“Brat, since you want to court death, I’ll fulfill your wish! Don’t blame us for bullying you!” Mu Xiuhan’s face changed briefly with killing intent surging in the depth of his pupils.

“Let’s end it quickly. He’s just an annoying clown,” said Zhao Chen coldly.

“I had the same idea,” smiled Chen Hao. Chen Hao was the first to attack as a cold aura exploded from within his body. At this moment, he perfectly combined his ice intent and pinnacle fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm together. Then, he pushed his palm towards Lin Yun, “Eight Desolate Frostbreak!”

A gigantic palm descended from the sky with an ancient seal.

“Monarch fortune martial technique!” An uproar was heard on the plaza because no one could maintain their composure. There were rumors that each of the seven heads had grasped a monarch fortune martial technique.

Glancing at the ancient seal from afar, the spectators could feel their souls slowly freezing. They were forced to circulate their origin energy to defend themselves from the endless chill. It was unbearable even though they weren’t the ones facing Chen Hao.

“Black Winged Demon Tiger Fist!” With a ferocious roar echoing out, black origin energy manifested into a terrifying demonic tiger with wings. The moment Zhao Qi clenched his fist, a pair of black beams shot out from the winged demonic tiger’s eyes.

The explosion of attacks made some of the spectators spit up blood. As for the weaker ones, they lost their lives to the shockwaves. When Zhao Qi executed another monarch fortune martial technique, a chill enveloped the entire plaza.

Luo Chen and his group couldn’t help but worry at this scene. Then, bolts of purple golden lightning descended from the sky as an ancient figure appeared out of nowhere. The ancient figure was donned with a crown and golden armor. Mu Xiuhan was finally making his move.

Under countless gazes, Mu Xiuhan’s eyes flashed with lightning as he formed an ancient seal. He then barked, “Mountain River Suppressing Lightning!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Some of the spectators threw up blood because they couldn’t bear the pressure. They even retreated in fear of getting swept up by the attack. Everyone was filled with fear as they stared at the three monarch fortune martial techniques.

“Lin Yun is finished…” Everyone looked at Lin Yun with a grave expression. There was no way Lin Yun could receive the attacks of Chen Hao, Zhao Qi, and Mu Xiuhan working together. Not even Luo Chen could do this.

“Kill!” Chen Hao roared. When his attack descended, a gigantic palm enveloped half the horizon and descended onto Lin Yun. The ancient seal alone was enough to freeze the surrounding air. At the same time, the shadow cast by the huge palm swallowed Lin Yun whole.

“There’s no way he can avoid it!” Everyone sucked in a cold breath of air out of worry.

But Lin Yun had no intention of escaping. When the huge palm was about to descend, Lin Yun raised his right hand with a golden seal blooming on his palm that shined like the sun. At the same time, a colossal winged figure appeared behind him with an ancient aura sweeping out.

“Divine Sun Breaking Seal!” Lin Yun roared. Clenching his hand, boundless golden radiance shined out as the Divine Sun Breaking Seal reached a new level.

“Even if you don’t die from this attack, you’ll still be frozen in ice!” Chen Hao sneered when he saw that his attack was about to land on the stage. He was confident in his advanced fortune martial technique. No one was optimistic that Lin Yun, who was in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm, could survive Chen Hao’s attack that made the plaza shake.

“He doesn’t stand a chance…” sighed one of the spectators. After all, the seven were called the seven heads for a reason. Suddenly, sounds of breaking glaciers rang out as cracks spread out on the huge palm. Chen Hao’s smile disappeared as he sensed something unusual about this situation.

But before he could even react, dazzling golden brilliance shined as the gigantic palm shattered into countless fragments. Ice fragments flew out as countless golden crows flew around.

Because Lin Yun destroyed the palm, Chen Hao suffered a backlash and threw up a mouthful of blood. The crowd couldn’t believe it. But before Lin Yun could catch his breath, Zhao Qi’s attack had already reached him, “Lin Yun, die!”

A winged demonic tiger roared as demonic light pierced through the sky and enveloped Lin Yun.

“Pitiful tricks!” Lin Yun snorted as suns began to circulate in his eyes, incinerating the two demonic beams from the winged tiger entirely. Then, the winged human behind him unfolded its wings which enveloped the sky instantly.

“Get lost!” When Lin Yun and Zhao Qi’s figures clashed in the sky, Zhao Qi’s attacks began to crumble. The power of the Divine Sun Breaking Seal surpassed Lin Yun’s imagination. In a split second, Zhao Qi threw up a mouthful of blood and was sent flying. Meanwhile, crack appeared on the winged demonic tiger that he had manifested.

“How is this possible?!”

“How did he do that?” The scene of Lin Yun destroying two monarch fortune martial techniques left everyone shocked. Just a moment ago, everyone was wondering if Lin Yun could survive under Chen Hao’s attack. And in the next second, Lin Yun destroyed Chen Hao and Zhao Qi’s attacks.

But the power of Lin Yun’s attack came to an end after breaking two monarch fortune martial techniques. Mu Xiuhan was the strongest of the three and still had an attack left. So even if Lin Yun took Chen Hao and Zhao Qi’s attacks head-on, there was still the issue of Mu Xiuhan’s attack.

“This is the end!” Mu Xiuhan’s face was indifferent, so much so that he didn’t even look at Lin Yun. With boundless lightning flashing in the sky above him, he looked like a lightning deity accompanied by boundless prestige. At the same time, the gigantic crowned figure manifested by Mu Xiuhan’s attack formed seals and pointed at Lin Yun from afar.

Purple golden lightning gathered on the gigantic figure’s finger before that formed a lightning dragon.

“Mountain River Suppressing Lightning? Mountains and rivers can be suppressed, but I can’t be!” Lin Yun looked at the lightning dragon charging at him. Letting out a roar, his sword intent began to blaze in the depth of his pupils, “Open!”

In the sky, an ancient gate seemed to have slowly opened as boundless sword intent poured out.

“Wait…t-t-this fluctuation…” Sensing the powerful fluctuation, the faces of Luo Chen and the others were full of disbelief.

“Sky sword intent!” Pei Xue also had a shock on her face as her brows were tightly locked together.
