Chapter 1477 - Master's Instruction

Jin Xuanyi casually tossed his sword away, plunging it into the ground before slowly raising his hands as if lifting a mountain. The golden light around him had exploded with his innate saint aura being emitted from his pores.

This scene made Lin Yun’s eyes light up, and he asked, “Junior Brother Jin, how much innate saint aura have you accumulated?”

“Not much. About four hundred, what about you?” Jin Xuanyi smiled with pride filling in his pupils.

“About a thousand, I guess?” Lin Yun casually replied. After he made a breakthrough in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, he manifested a large number of Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura. After he refined the Dragon-Blooded Crystal and the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower, he manifested more Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura. He didn’t count them, but it had exceeded a thousand.

“Are you doing this on purpose?” Jin Xuanyi’s face became dark because Lin Yun could no longer be considered a genius but a monster. Lin Yun even rubbed salt on his wound by asking how much innate saint aura he had refined. Then again, it also made sense because if Lin Yun didn’t have a shocking foundation, he wouldn’t be able to defeat him and Ji Shuxuan.

Gritting his teeth, Jin Xuanyi said, “Come on! Let me see how strong your physique is!”

“Here I come, then!” Lin Yun smiled before he tapped his feet on the ground. When he disappeared and reappeared before Jin Xuanyi, he activated one-tenth of the dragon runes. More accurately speaking, they should be called saint runes now!

His dragon runes were now comparable to sixth-grade or even seventh-grade saint runes. Most importantly, his dragon runes now contained dense vitality, and this was equivalent to possessing spirituality, and it was more terrifying than Lin Yun had imagined.

As the dragon runes poured into his fist, his entire arm began to emit a metallic luster. His punch broke through most of Jin Xuanyi’s innate saint aura, but Jin Xuanyi didn’t take half a step back.

But this made the corner of Jin Xuanyi’s lips twitch as he bore the pain and snorted before he squeezed out a smile, “It’s impressive that you can achieve this by relying on only your physique. But it won’t be easy to injure me!”

But Lin Yun glanced at Jin Xuanyi and didn’t tell him that he barely used one-tenth of his strength. He briefly pondered before he said, “Use the Skydome 9 Swords. Just the first form is good enough.”

He was really curious if his current physique could withstand the attack of high-grade ghost spirit martial technique. Because if he couldn’t handle that, he might lose his life when facing enemies, which was risky for him, even if Jin Xuanyi only used the first form.

“Are you sure about that?” Jin Xuanyi was shocked by what Lin Yun said.

“Let’s give it a try. I’m somewhat confident about it.” Lin Yun said seriously. But when he saw that Jin Xuanyi was still hesitant, Lin Yun suddenly charged forth and mobilized three thousand dragon runes. This made his entire arm turn metallic with traces of blood marked on his arm, surging with vast vitality.

Under those blood marks, Lin Yun’s vitality began to skyrocket. His punch caused the surrounding air to tremble when he threw his punch out.

Taking Lin Yun’s attack, Jin Xuanyi spat blood from his mouth as the innate saint aura around him dissipated under Lin Yun’s attack. When he flew a hundred meters out, he fell to one knee and held his chest with his face pale. This scene changed Lin Yun’s face as he quickly stepped forth and helped Jin Xuanyi up.

“I’m fine. Senior Brother Lin, you didn’t use your full strength earlier, right?” Jin Xuanyi asked.

“Yeah. I only used about one-tenth of my strength,” Lin Yun replied. One-tenth was equivalent to eight hundred dragon runes, and the power was incomparable to three thousand dragon runes.

His words made Jin Xuanyi bitterly smile before he agreed to Lin Yun’s request and used the first form of the Skydome 9 Swords.

This time, the Blood Flame Divine Runes blazed as thunderstorms revolved within Lin Yun’s pupils. It was as if an azure dragon had possessed him. With a single thought, the eight thousand dragon runes formed into some battle armor, wrapping him tightly from his head to his feet.

When Jin Xuanyi’s sword that could even slay a Dragon Pulse Realm deacon landed on the battle armor wrapped around Lin Yun, sparks flew around as a domineering dragon coiled around Lin Yun, causing the sky to turn dark with lightning rolling in the clouds.

When Lin Yun stretched his hand out, the dragon flew up and grew to nearly a thousand meters in the thunderclouds. As Lin Yun pushed his palm out, the gigantic azure dragon flew out, easily shattering Jin Xuanyi’s attack and sending him flying back before the latter could respond.

“H-How is this possible?!” Jin Xuanyi was shocked beyond words and couldn’t believe Lin Yun had only used his physical strength. Wasn’t the Dragon-Blooded Crystal a little too terrifying? Or rather, Lin Yun’s body-refining technique was strong enough that it had complemented the crystal.

If the Dragon-Blooded Crystal was in his hands instead of Lin Yun’s, he definitely wouldn’t be able to reach Lin Yun’s height. This made Jin Xuanyi dumbfounded for a long time.

After Lin Yun formed a seal, he dissipated the Azure Dragon Battle Armor before he walked toward the depressed Jin Xuanyi. He felt a little guilty because he was here for Jin Xuanyi’s help. But as a result, he made Jin Xuanyi throw out blood several times. He asked, “Are you alright?”

“I’m fine. I can still hold on.” Jin Xuanyi smiled, indicating that he was fine.

“May I ask what rank you are on the Elysium Core Ranking?” Lin Yun was prepared to leave the sect to train. So he needed a general understanding of the Elysium Core Ranking.

“Among the same generation or my general ranking?” Jin Xuanyi asked.

“Is there any difference?” Lin Yun asked.

“Of course there is. Those in the top one thousand five hundredths are monsters over a hundred years old. Some are a few hundred years old, and they’ve reached the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm!” Jin Xuanyi smiled.

“Why? Aren’t they worried that they’ll run out of lifespan?” Lin Yun was surprised to hear that. On the Empyrean Ranking, if someone was at an old age, it meant that their talent was limited. It wasn’t because they didn’t want to make a breakthrough, but because their talent restricted them.

But the Elysium Core Ranking was different. Everyone who could reach the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm was considered a genius, and it was impossible for them to be unable to make a breakthrough into the Dragon Pulse Realm. Cultivators at the Elysium Core Realm only had a lifespan of three hundred years, and reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm would increase their lifespan.

“Come on in. I’ll treat you to a drink.” Jin Xuanyi wasn’t in a hurry to explain and led Lin Yun into his residence. They came before a long desk, and he took out a jar of wine to serve Lin Yun. After several contacts, he realized Lin Yun’s character wasn’t bad and he wasn’t as arrogant as he appeared to be.

“First-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm can boost your strength by one-fold, and the multiplication continues as you increase your stars. You should know about that, right?” Jin Xuanyi asked.

“I do. But how are they related?” Lin Yun took a sip of wine before he looked at Jin Xuanyi with curiosity.

“Then have you ever thought about why condensing a star can multiply your strength by one-fold? It’s because such rules no longer exist at the Dragon Pulse Realm. It's only at the Elysium Core Realm.” Jin Xuanyi smiled.

Lin Yun was surprised to hear that because he really didn’t think about it. But if he thought about it carefully, he could feel his scalp going numb. Because if they could further multiply their strength after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, wouldn’t they become invincible?

“Has anyone succeeded?” Lin Yun asked.

“None. At least not after the Golden Era was destroyed. It was rumored that it was the power of deity!” Jin Xuanyi said with a solemn expression.

“None? Then, why are so many people trying?” Lin Yun was baffled.

“Haha. This is, after all, a legend concerning deities. But what if it’s true? If they can succeed, they’ll become invincible in the Divine Dragon Era, and not even the Nine Emperors can hold their ground before them.” Jin Xuanyi smiled.

But Lin Yun didn’t say a word because it felt too unreal.

“Furthermore, there’s no harm in condensing a few more stars. Some of our generations condensed all nine stars before making a breakthrough!” Jin Xuanyi continued his explanation.

“Senior Brother, are you thinking of going out?” Jin Xuanyi asked after they chatted for a while longer.

Lin Yun nodded, but he didn’t say he was leaving for a dragon bone.

“With your strength, it’s not an exaggeration to say that you’re invincible amongst our generation in the Ancient Barren Domain. So there’s no need for you to be too cautious!” Jin Xuanyi said.

But Lin Yun smiled when he heard that because he didn’t want to be invincible within the same generation but invincible amongst those in the Elysium Core Realm. There was no meaning to being invincible within the same generation, not to mention that he might not really be invincible. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lin Yun was confident in his swordsmanship if it was amongst the same generation, but it differed from other martial dao. Everything would only be apparent after he fought with others, not to mention that the competition over the dragon bone would be complicated, and he had to be cautious about its existence.

(Lin Yun, come to the Saint Mountain, immediately.) A voice that Lin Yun hadn’t heard for a long time resounded in his ears while he was talking with Jin Xuanyi. This instantly made Lin Yun’s eyes light up because the voice was from the Radiant Sword Saint. He gulped down the wine in his cup and excitedly said, “Junior Brother Jin, I’m afraid that I have to leave. My master is looking for me.”

Only at this moment, Jin Xuanyi recalled that Lin Yun still had another identity: the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. It was no wonder why Lin Yun was so excited. This instantly made him jealous because the Sword Sect was devoting a lot of resources to nurturing the saints’ disciples, not to mention being the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint.

The Radiant Sword Saint was one of the Three Sword Saints in the Eastern Desolation and the strongest powerhouse in the Sword Sect. As long as the Radiant Sword Saint exists, no one would dare to have any malicious thoughts about the Sword Sect. So it was the dream of many swordsmen to become the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple.
