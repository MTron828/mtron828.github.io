Chapter 1827 - Silver-Eyed Demonspirit (2)

“Something is wrong. Retreat!” Lin Yun pulled An Liuyan back. The commotion created was great, with Yu Wenxiu and Kou Tianhua showing great strength. That was especially the case for Kou Tianhua, whose cultivation was at the fifth stage Profound Life Stage, not to mention he even grasped the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Blade Intent.

However, because they were at the bottom of the pool, and he couldn’t display as much fighting prowess as he could have if he was in the outside world. After all, he was the disciple of the Whitebone Blade Saint.

But Lin Yun had a feeling this demonic corpse wasn’t simple. Unlike other demonic corpses, there were many unusual aspects of this demonic corpse.

This scene practically confirmed Lin Yun’s speculation. Just when everyone was about to defeat the demonic corpse, the vertical eye on the demonic corpse’s forehead opened up. When a shocking silver demonic light shot out from its vertical eye, a ferocious demonic aura spread out from its body. Under the demonic aura, dozens of people were sent flying away, and half of the people were nearly severed into two.

“Damn it! This isn’t a saint of the Black Tortoise Clan, but a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit!” Yu Wenxiu squinted his eyes, and couldn’t be bothered any longer. He didn’t even hesitate to turn and run for his life.

Kou Tianhua shivered with a terrifying chill within his pupils. He didn’t even hesitate to turn and run for his life. He no longer wanted any saint-grade cores. With that, a massacre occurred.

Everyone finally came to their senses. This demonic corpse was on a whole different level from those they have faced before. Lin Yun and An Liuyan had already retreated to the side. When the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit opened its eyes, they were the first to charge to the surface. No matter what the hell this monster was, this wasn’t something they could deal with.

“Black Tortoise… Secret Key…” Right then, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s eyes became clear, and it began to struggle upon seeing Lin Yun’s figure. But very quickly, its pupils were corroded with demonic aura once more, and the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s face became sinister once more.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit no longer cared about anyone and charged in Lin Yun’s direction. When Lin Yun and An Liuyan emerged from the surface of the pond, they swiftly landed on the shore, along with a splash of lightning magma.

This instantly made them heave out a sigh of relief because they were finally safe. But it was a different case for most of the cultivators who came here because the majority of them lost their lives. It was fine if they were killed by the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, but it was a grievance for those who died in the hands of fellow human cultivators.

On the shore of the Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool, there was still an endless flow of people attracted by the Black Tortoise Cores. When they saw Lin Yun and An Liuyan coming out, they were briefly shocked before their expressions were replaced by disappointment. After all, since someone came out, this meant that all the treasures must be gone.

“Leave here quickly!” Lin Yun and An Liuyan fled without any hesitation.

Everyone left according to their speculations as Yu Wenxiu, Kou Tianhua, and many others broke emerged from the pool. But compared to Lin Yun, they were in a more embarrassed state, and they didn’t even have the time to catch their breath.

Just when everyone was baffled, the pool exploded and the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was hovering in the air, flickering with lightning and its demonic aura spreading out. Under the demonic aura, everyone felt a great pressure, and there were even some who fell to the ground. At this moment, they couldn’t even leave, even if they wanted.

“We’re finished.” Kou Tianhua and the others had despair in their pupils. Although their strengths had returned to their peak after leaving the pool, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit also became more powerful.

“That brat is really fast at running.” Kou Tianhua furiously roared. Lin Yun and An Liuyan had already fled.

But to their surprise, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit merely glanced at everyone for a brief moment before it turned into a silver streak of light and chased after Lin Yun’s group of two. When the pressure suddenly disappeared, Kou Tianhua and the others let out a breath of relief. Kou Tianhua couldn’t help smiling, “I still thought that brat was safe, but he’s finished now.”

Yu Wenxiu’s eyes began to flicker as he fell into deep thoughts. He was pondering as to why the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was chasing after Lin Yun. Could it be that there was something on Lin Yun that attracted its attention? The more he thought about it, the more likely he felt it was possible, and this was why the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit ignored them.

Then again, it was only a possibility, so he might be mistaken. The demonspirit might be attracted to Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Physique and perhaps the saint blood could help it recover even faster.

Suddenly, Yu Wenxiu thought of something and looked at Kou Tianhua with a smile. He asked, “Brother Kou isn’t going after them to take a look? Don’t forget his head is worth a Demonfeather Order.”

“Do I look like an idiot to you?” Kou Tianhua sneered. But as soon as he spoke, he began to hesitate. The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit might be terrifying, but it might not be impossible for him to confront it. Perhaps the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit would leave behind Lin Yun’s corpse after it was done killing him?

But Yu Wenxiu merely smiled and left with the Ming Cult’s disciples.

“Young Master, what should we do? That Yu Wenxiu is a little vicious, so doesn't fall for his words…” Lady Stone said.

“I know.” Kou Tianhua said, but his eyes were flickering with reluctance.

Far away, Lin Yun and An Liuyan fled for an hour before they heaved out a breath of relief, but they still continued to fly in mid-air. They were like two streaks of light soaring across the horizon, and they didn’t let down their vigilance.

Suddenly, silver demonic radiance shone in the sky, and they both could sense a demonic aura approaching.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun’s face changed. They already fled, so why did the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit chase after them? Right then, he suddenly thought of something and wondered if Gu Jun was right, he had something on him that attracted the demonic corpses. Could it be that fragment of tortoiseshell? He didn’t see anything unusual about it, but the old man probably noticed something.

“You go ahead. I’ll lure it away.” Lin Yun soon made a decision and fled in another direction. It also happened just as he had expected. The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit didn’t even bat an eye at An Liuyan and chased after him without any hesitation.

When Lin Yun noticed the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit chasing after him, it further confirmed his speculation. But this Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was even more terrifying than the demonic corpse he faced previously, not to mention Gu Jun wasn’t there. So he had no way of dealing with it unless he brought out the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

But using the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella would be accompanied by phenomena, and someone might notice it. At that time, all his secrets would be exposed.

“Young Master!” An Liuyan became anxious upon seeing this scene, and she tightened her grip on the Profound Moon Fan with uneasiness appearing within her pupils. She couldn’t afford to let anything happen to Lin Yun, so she quickly made her decision. She no longer hesitated and quietly flew in the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s direction.

Lin Yun pushed the Divine Sunchasing Art to the limit like a sun, emitting a blazing radiance down from the sky. His current speed was so fast that the surroundings became distorted, and even heaven and earth had combined together in his eyes.

But the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit constantly emitted a black demonic radiance that was like a dye that swiftly spread across this distorted space.

Seeing that he could no longer flee and he might even be caught in the demonic aura, Lin Yun took in a deep breath before his gaze became eerie. Since he couldn’t escape, he might as well fight to the end. If he had no other choice, then he could only bring out the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella to kill it.

The moment he turned around, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit already pounced over. When Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword, his sword intent began gushing out, and he swiftly exchanged ten-odd moves with the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

As sword rays were constantly being shattered by the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, it threw out a punch that made Lin Yun throw out a mouthful of blood. The difference in strength was too great, and there was nothing he could do at all.

Lin Yun’s pupils finally had fear reflected because he realized he had underestimated the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, and he might really have to bring out the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

“Brat, what are you standing there for? Waiting for death? Get out of the way!” Right then, Gu Jun’s roar resounded.
