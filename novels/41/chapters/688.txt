Chapter 689 - Pressing Forth

The Sword Sect wasn’t really ancient. A few thousand years ago, it ruled the entire Ancient Southern Domain. It was said that the Sword Sect had a long heritage. Whenever its ruins were revealed, there was evidence that proved how glorious it was.

But for some reason, the glorious Sword Sect was reduced to ashes. Logically speaking, there should be some information about the Sword Sect left behind. But for some reason, no one knew how this overlord force of the Ancient Southern Domain was destroyed.

Even the Heavenly Sword Sect, who had a partial inheritance of the Sword Sect, didn’t have any information and the nine overlord forces had sealed the secret tightly. This gave the impression that there was a plot against the Sword Sect, but this truth was in the hands of select groups.

But no matter what, the moment the Sword Sect’s ruin appeared, it would attract the attention of all the elites, especially swordsmen. Everyone in the Sword Sect was proficient in using swords, so they naturally had an unparalleled inheritance in sword dao. So as long as they could find pieces of it, the elites would harvest a huge fortune.

Every time the Sword Sect’s ruins were born, it would welcome geniuses from Skymound City. If the geniuses from the other cities weren’t far away, they would also come and join the fun.

In the Chen Manor of the Skymound City, Chen Ziyu and Chen Xiong were both standing in a pavilion as they watched the sword ray soaring through the mountain range with burning eyes.

“Big brother, look! The secret realm will probably open in two days.” Chen Xiong’s eyes lit up with excitement. “Big brother, you returned at the right time. Everything in there will belong to us. At that time, you can trample on everyone when the three overlord forces start recruiting!”

The forces that represented the seven strongest geniuses in Skymound City held enmity towards Lin Yun, but the competition between each other was also great. After all, no one would want to be on the same level as others. Seven strongest geniuses of Skymound City? It was better to be the strongest genius and not one of many.

Chen Ziyu fell into a brief silence before he turned to look at Chen Xiong, “I heard that you were miserably defeated by this person at the Death Auction?”

When Chen Xiong heard that, the smile on his face disappeared and he lowered his head. He and Yang Yunpeng had kneeled during the Death auction, which was terrible for their reputation. Gnashing his teeth, Chen Xiong said, “Yeah.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“How is that person’s strength?” Chen Ziyu’s face was solemn because he had heard about the Death Auction. But he still wanted to hear it personally from Chen Xiong.

“His cultivation is low since it’s only in the greater Yang stage. But his xiantian sword intent has reached complete mastery,” said Chen Xiong. Although Chen Xiong’s sword intent was strong, he was still defeated by Lin Yun in a single sword, which was a great humiliation to him.

“This person has to die. If Her Highness Ruoyou isn’t appeased and she continues to be angry, we’ll be impicated,” said Chen Ziyu with his eyes flashing coldly.

“Big brother, are the rumors real?” Chen Xiong was astonished as he heard that Chen Ziyu and Chu Muyan were refused when they tried to visit Qing Ruoyou.

Chen Ziyu didn’t utter a word and only nodded his head. This made Chen Xiong’s voice weaken, “I don’t think it’ll be that bad, right? She might be beautiful, but there’s no need for you to hold her so high with your talent…”

Qing Ruoyou had a noble status as the Indigomoon Elysium’s princess. Although people like him couldn’t be compared to her, his big brother had strong talent and there was an opportunity for him to stand with Qing Ruoyou on equal ground.

Chen Ziyu looked at Chen Xiong coldly, “What do you know? In terms of talent, there’s no way I can be compared to her. Furthermore, she’s the daughter of the previous Indigomoon Elysium’s sect master. Do you think that she’s called a princess just because of her beauty? It has been a long time since her father had appeared, but legend has it that he’s a rare empyrean in the Ancient Southern Domain. Chu Muyan and I both want to join the Indigomoon Elysium to receive her father’s guidance.”

Chen Xiong took a cold breath because he never expected that Qing Ruoyou’s father was an empyrean. No wonder she was so aloof and even endured having the Divine Indigo Radiantstone being taken by Lin Yun without making a move.

“Hmph. Even if it weren't for Qing Ruoyou, I would have to kill him for humiliating you and destroying our Chen Clan’s Profound Note Bell!” Chen Ziyu’s eyes flashed coldly as he said this. He was shrouded with a faint chill that looked like a layer of fog. Just one glance could make one’s soul shiver. This was the phenomenon that would occur when the Chen Clan’s Frost Monument Sutra reached a high level.

“But all seven geniuses are gathered. Ouyang Hao and the rest have released their statement, so he probably fled already. He even has a powerful sword intent,” said Chen Xiong fearfully.

“Xiantian sword intent is powerful, but it’s not invincible. Otherwise, Nangong Wanyu wouldn’t just be in the top ten on the previous Draconic Banquet,” said Chen Ziyu. He continued, “Your eyesight is too shallow since there are plenty of ways to deal with it.”

His words only made Chen Xiong suspicious instead of comforted. After all, recalling Lin Yun’s sword intent made his scalp feel numb. Was there really a way to deal with Lin Yun’s sword intent? But since his big brother had said about it, then it must be true.

“Him fleeing? Don’t worry. Someone like him who comes from a pitiful place won’t give up on this opportunity, especially since he’s a swordsman. He would rather lose his life than give up on the Sword Sect’s ruins,” said Chen Ziyu in his purple clothes.

Chen Xiong couldn’t comprehend Chen Ziyu’s words, but this was also the reason why Chen Xiong was an ordinary genius, unlike Chen Ziyu.

“He’s definitely a talented swordsman to make it this far, but it’s a pity that he ran into me. I’ve slaughtered plenty of swordsmen more prideful than him and granting him death is letting him go easy for humiliating my Chen Clan!” Chen Ziyu said this as if he were saying something insignificant. It gave him an unfathomable and profound aura.

Standing beside Chen Ziyu, Chen Xiong could feel his blood boil as if Lin Yun was being humiliated right in front of him.

Outside Flamedragon Hill, bolts of lightning would tear apart the sky as Lin Yun sat with his legs crossed in a valley with nine bolts of lightning flashing on his body. When he opened his eyes, the natural phenomenon suddenly disappeared.

He exhaled and breathed normally. He could control the natural phenomenon as he wished. Standing up slowly from the ground, he threw away the Five Acute Lightning Crystal in his hand.

He had been refining the Five Acute Lightning Crystals over the past ten days. When he refined the last crystal, the dragon rune on his body had grown from five to nine. As the nine dragon runes wandered on the surface of his body, they looked like nine ferocious dragons.

Lin Yun didn’t have a robust figure, but his body felt explosive as the azure dragon energy coursed within his body. It felt like his azure dragon energy could shake the sky and ground. This was the transformation Lin Yun had obtained after reaching the fourth stage in the Azure Dragon Enneaform.

Additionally, he had also reached the pinnacle greater Yang stage and had a sturdy foundation. He only needed an opportunity to make a breakthrough.

Looking into the distance, Lin Yun noticed the sword ray that soared into the sky two days ago, and he could vaguely see that it was a path towards a mysterious world. Simultaneously, he could also see an evil aura leaking out from the mysterious world.

“Is that a secret realm?” Lin Yun’s motive for coming to the Thunder Prefecture was to find the Sword Sect’s ruins to make a breakthrough. After all, the Overlord Sword was inherited from the Sword Sect. But he had practically offended all the forces in Skymound City, so he didn’t need to think to figure out what awaited him.

Skymound City was filled with boundless temptation, but it was also like a ferocious tiger baring its fangs at him. He knew that it would be dangerous for him to head there, but he had no reason to be afraid.

He was confident that as long as the older generations didn’t get involved, he could face the seven strongest geniuses. Furthermore, he was a swordsman, so his sword intent needed to be tempered in death in order to be sharper.
