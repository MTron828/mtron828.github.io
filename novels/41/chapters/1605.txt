Chapter 1606 - Still Had The Flower Burial Sword!

The dragon flames swiftly enveloped the painting behind Lu Chen, and this scene shocked everyone else even more. It was already bizarre enough that Lin Yun could devour the dragon flames, but he could even spat them out. Lin Yun was clearly only at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. So how did he manage to do it?

Was the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple really that strong? Anyone could guess that Lin Yun wasn't weak, since he’s the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. But no one expected that he would be so heaven-defying, not to mention that his opponent was a genius of the Golden Generation at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm and the chief disciple of a prominent sect.

As Lu Chen flew out from the sea of flames, his hair was unkept, giving off a burnt smell, and his face was black.

“Lin Yun, I won’t let you off so easily!” Lu Chen felt greatly humiliated and dashed at Lin Yun.

A grand battle occurred as the two exchanged ten-odd moves in mid-air, with flames covering the entire sky and dragon origin radiating violently. As heaven and earth shook, dragon roars echoed. Lu Chen had a more significant advantage with his cultivation, but he couldn’t gain any advantage in the fight.

With a flash, Lin Yun descended from the sky. Lu Chen’s face was dark, and he wore a sinister smile, “Can’t block it anymore?”

Lin Yun was strong, but it was a pity that he was only at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm and had reached his limit after ten-odd moves. When Lu Chen turned his head and looked at the Golden Lotus in mid-air, he descended towards the Buddha’s palm, wanting to obtain it before anything else.

But who knew that when Lin Yun landed on the ground, he began slaughtering the Myriad Beast Gate disciples in the surroundings?

“You bastard!” Lu Chen cussed and immediately gave up on the Golden Lotus before charging at Lin Yun. But he was too late. The ground was covered in blood from the deaths of ten-odd Myriad Beast Gate disciples when he arrived.

“Senior Brother, save us!” The remaining disciples ran toward Lu Chen with despair on their faces.

“Lin Yun, fight me if you have the guts!” Lu Chen was furious upon seeing so many disciples killed by Lin Yun, and his pupils had turned red.

“This…” The audience’s faces were complicated after seeing the death of so many of Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples. It was too unreal for one person to slaughter an entire sect. Although this wasn’t the whole party of the Myriad Beast Gate, there were dozens of them, but they were powerless before Lin Yun.

“How pitiful.”

“They were still cheering earlier, but they’re all dead now.”

“Lin Yun is ruthless. Not a single one of them was spared!”

“Why keep them alive? That group of people was just saying they wanted to offer Lin Yun’s head to Qin Tian.”

“Well done! The Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples are a bunch of bastards. They’re too overbearing just because they allied with the Profound Sky Sect. Someone should’ve taught them a lesson long ago.” None of the audience members had a favorable opinion of the Myriad Beast Gate, and they would only rejoiced at the Myriad Beast Gate’s misfortune.

None of them had sympathy for the Myriad Beast Gate, and it didn’t take long for almost all of the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples to be slaughtered by Lin Yun. Lu Chen went insane when he saw this scene. His dragon claw descended at Lin Yun, with his dragon origin sweeping out, easily destroying a mountain.

“Demonic Dragon Bell!” Lu Chen roared, and an ancient bell with dragon runes engraved on it appeared above him. When the bell echoed, the fluctuation spread out and put pressure on Lin Yun. The soundwave easily severed many people who couldn’t avoid in time into two.

“This is a secret treasure of the Dragon Clan. Lin Yun, just wait till I refine you!” Lu Chen’s pupils flashed with ferocity and charged forth.

But Lin Yun’s hands joined together, forming the Sovereign Dragon Seal. As a seven-colored light bloomed, an unrivaled dragon aura swept out, and Lin Yun’s aura began to rise under the empowerment of the seal. This made the terrifying bell start to sway under the power of the Sovereign Dragon Seal.

As Lin Yun soared to the sky, he collided with Lu Chen. They were so fast that they looked like they were teleporting around.

“Lin Yun, I’ll retrieve your head today!” Lu Chen roared, executing his ghost spirit martial technique. A hundred flaming mountains gathered around him and condensed into a terrifying saint mountain with dragons gathered above the mountain.

This terrifying phenomenon looked like a descending saint mountain of the dragon clan. As the dragons released a ferocious roar, a boundless dragon aura swept out that felt like it wanted to devour Lin Yun.

Heaven and Earth Unite!

Lin Yun executed the Divine Solar Lunar Fist with the Sovereign Dragon Seal. The sky within a thousand miles turned into a golden ocean, and the ground manifested into a silver lake that looked like a mirror.

As Lin Yun reached out, the golden ocean and silver lake gathered in his palm before flying towards Lu Chen’s attack. Under the empowerment of the Sovereign Dragon Fist, Lin Yun was enveloped in a golden light, and it didn’t take long for an outcome to emerge.

Lu Chen threw out a mouthful of blood as Lin Yun’s attack, empowered with the Sovereign Dragon Seal, wreaked havoc within his body. On the other hand, Lin Yun’s outer robe was torn, and he only suffered some light injuries thanks to the dragon rune.

“Fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm doesn’t seem so impressive, after all. If you’re in the powerful sects, I’m afraid you wouldn’t even make it into the top three rankings.” Lin Yun said.

“How dare you!” Lu Chen roared. He felt humiliated by those words.

The two stood on the head of the Buddha with a wild wind blowing around them. Lu Chen naturally wouldn’t admit defeat so easily. The bell that was sent flying descended from the sky with a beam of light shooting out of it, enveloping him, “I’ve not lost yet!”

There seemed to be a power in the unsealed bell, and Lu Chen’s aura began to rise under the light beam.

“You’re starting to get on my nerves.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with annoyance. Drawing the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun swung it out. When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, everyone still had no idea what Lin Yun did because everything happened too quickly. But in that brief moment, everyone could feel a great horror, as if an ominous beast was eyeing them as a chill ran down their spines. It gave them the feeling that they would lose their heads if they dared to move, but because everything happened too quickly, this gave everyone a misperception.

“It’s a sharp sword. But why did you sheath it?” Lu Chen asked coldly. He was terrified earlier but felt relieved after seeing no injuries on him. He continued, “It’s already too late for you now. This Demonic Dragon Bell has a true dragon’s remnant soul sealed within it, and I am now comparable to a fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm! If you kneel before me, I can consider…”

“You’re already dead.” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“What did you say?” Lu Chen was surprised that he was interrupted halfway.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“I said that you’re already dead.” Lin Yun said. When he was done, a cut streaked across Lu Chen’s neck, making the latter’s face change.

Even when Lu Chen held onto his neck, it didn’t stop his blood from flowing out and he panicked, “No, no… I have the Demonic Dragon Bell. How can I die like this…”

Whenever he said a word, blood spewed even more from his neck. His neck eventually flew off before he could finish.

Lin Yun held onto his sword and fell to one knee, his face becoming pale. He looked at Lu Chen’s decapitated head with mockery in his pupils. Did Lu Chen think that he was the only one with treasures? The Flower Burial Sword was a Glory Saint Artifact. He just couldn’t be bothered with drawing it before.

The power of the Glory Saint Artifact far exceeded his imagination. Or rather, the power of the Flower Burial Sword after it became a Glory Saint Artifact. The exhaustion of his vitality and dragon origin was a little terrifying.

He swiftly swallowed a pellet and briefly sat down before opening his eyes. The Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples might all be dead, but there were still others around, and he couldn’t afford to spend too much time resting.

This was why he used the Flower Burial Sword earlier; he wanted to intimidate them. They might be unhappy with the Myriad Beast Gate, but they would be more ruthless when a treasure was involved, once the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples were taken care of.

He couldn’t put his faith in the fact that they would behave, and he would rather rely on the sword in his hand. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he saw several people dashing over. They didn’t give off any killing intent, but carefully approached Lin Yun with friendly expressions. Still, Lin Yun knew that they were probably scheming something because even an idiot could tell he was injured in the previous battle. But it was a question of how injured he was.

Most importantly, Lin Yun was the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint. So they felt that Lin Yun wouldn’t kill them like demonic cultivators. If Lin Yun could still put up a fight, they would show their concern for his injuries. But if Lin Yun wasn’t in a good state, it was a question of who the Golden Lotus belonged to.

They were startled when they saw Lin Yun opening his eyes, and their gazes changed. The party leader smiled, “Brother Lin, we’ve admired you for a long time. How are your injuries? Are you still alright?”

But Lin Yun simply grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword and swung it down, instantly severing them into two. When he sheathed his sword, he stood up and looked around, “Death to anyone who dares to approach.”

Did they think he was stupid? They should’ve helped out a long time ago if they admired him. When ten-odd corpses fell from the sky, this instantly dispelled everyone’s thoughts, and many people reluctantly left.

After soaring into the sky, Lin Yun landed on the Buddha statue’s palm, waiting for the Golden Lotus to descend.

“How slow.” Lin Yun placed his sword to the side and closed his eyes to readjust his condition while waiting for the Golden Lotus to descend. Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red might not be with him, but he still had the Flower Burial Sword!
