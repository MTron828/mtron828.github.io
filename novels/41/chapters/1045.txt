Chapter 1046 - Death To Those Who Stands In My Way

As the sky hung high in the sky, Lin Yun bolted through the streets of Four Phase City. His hair fluttered in the wind as he sped out of the city.

“Lin Yun is out!” Many people were paying attention to Lin Yun, so he naturally attracted their attention immediately.

“Looks like he already knows what the Realm Sons did. I wonder if he can reach Wind Mound City in time…” The sudden news seemed to disrupt Lin Yun’s rhythm.

At the same time, many figures were bolting through the darkness, following Lin Yun closely. The groups consisted of war realm scouts and newly risen geniuses who weren’t happy with Lin Yun’s fame.

The moment Lin Yun left the city, a comet streaked across the horizon and enveloped Lin Yun. It was a fist blazing with flames that was attacking him. Lin Yun merely waved his hand to resolve the attack.

“Flower Burial, why are you in such a hurry to leave?” A burst of laughter sounded out as a purple-clothed youth appeared. Lin Yun’s face changed because he was imagining the Nether Divinity Realm Son stripping down Yue Weiwei.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun said with a killing intent in his tone.

The purple-clothed youth smiled with squinted eyes, “Lin Yun, your killing aura is too heavy. I’ve heard about you, so I just wanted to get to know you.”

When he spoke, he clasped his hands together and a purple flaming pearl appeared in front of his forehead. The ancient pearl emitted a boundless aura with torrential flames.

When the terrifying flames swept out, it formed a towering wall in front of Lin Yun. The pearl clearly had an extraordinary origin as it was found in an ancient ruin in the Heavenly Path.

Lin Yun was anxious despite knowing that the Nether Divinity Realm Son was purposely messing with him. However, he couldn’t afford to let anything happen to Yue Weiwei. After all, the reputation of a woman was more important than her life.

No matter what, Lin Yun had to rush to Wind Mound City. However, as soon as he started his journey, he ran into someone. The situation was infuriating for him, which caused his aura to go berserk.

“What dense killing aura. It looks like the war realms were right to call you a demon. On the behalf of heaven, I’ll be punishing you for your actions!” The purple-clothed youth said before he joined his hands together.

At this moment, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly, “Which dog do you belong to? The Nether Divinity, Elysium Trigram, or Profound Dragon? Forget it, just die.”

Lin Yun decisively made a move, unleashing a brilliant sword hum with his fingers. As the boundless sword aura soared into the sky, Lin Yun used his sky sword intent.

“Hmmm?” The purple-clothed youth’s face changed. After all, he had obtained an inheritance in the Heavenly Path along with that mysterious pearl that could be linked with dao. Strangely, Lin Yun’s sword made him feel like his soul had been locked and that there was no place for him in the world.

In the next second, he activated the purple pearl. Boundless flames in the form of spiritual runes locked together into a complicated array.

As Lin Yun’s sword intent began to hum, he swung his sword and destroyed all the array. However, the purple pearl wasn’t ordinary, so the arrays constantly regenerated. In the end, Lin Yun’s attack was exhausted.

When the purple-clothed youth saw this scene, he said coldly, “Looks like sky sword intent isn’t that impressive after all.”

The purple-clothed youth was feeling courageous as he returned to his arrogant ways. Disdain appeared in his eyes as he looked down on Lin Yun and laughed, “Lin Yun, stay here obediently. Do you want to go to Wind Mound City? Dream on! Yue Weiwei is a great beauty in the Heavenly Path and even the Realm Sons are attracted to her. I bet many people wish to see how she looks without any clothes on!”

The purple-clothed man began to reveal his nature after blocking Lin Yun’s sky sword intent.

“That’s Zhao Feng. He’s ranked first on the purple ranking!”

“I heard that he had an extraordinary encounter and obtained a Fire Spiritual Pearl. Apparently, it has many uses aside from strengthening his flame intent.”

“Looks like he was tempted by the promise of the Realm Sons.” Many people instantly recognized the purple-clothed youth.

Zhao Feng’s strength was clear, especially with the Fire Spiritual Pearl. That pearl had been refined by a saint in the past and had many spiritual runes in it. So everyone began to worry about Lin Yun .

“If you want to stop Lin Yun, you’ll have to get through us!” Luo Chen’s group of three flew out from the city. Luo Chen was the first to attack as he had absorbed most of the inheritance he got from the Azure Dragon Palace. Raising his head, he unleashed a dragon, but it was directly refined by the arrays in the Fire Spiritual Pearl.

“What power!” Qin Lin and Jun Mengcheng were shocked by this scene as they quickly flew into the sky to unleash their inheritance from the Azure Dragon Palace. When the two dragon claws tore through the sky, they charged towards the arrays.

One had to admit that the Azure Dragon Palace’s inheritances were formidable, but Jun Mengchen and Qin Lin weren’t strong enough to execute them in their entirety. The purple-clothed youth then threw out his palm, as a gigantic flaming palm instantly crushed the two dragon’s claws.

Qin Lin and Jun Mengchen threw up a mouthful of blood. This scene had left many people outside the city shocked because the pearl was more terrifying than they imagined.

“Thank you for the help, but let me handle him,” said Lin Yun. Lin Yun didn't look down on Zhao Feng and directly brought out his sky sword intent. Although he didn’t use his sword, the power wasn’t ordinary.

“Hmph, Lin Yun, you’re only ranked tenth on the purple ranking. You think you can stand against me? Your sky sword intent wasn’t even anything in front of me! Let me see what you are going to do now!” The purple-clothed youth was arrogant especially after destroying the attacks of Luo Chen’s group of three.

Lin Yun was under immense pressure because he could tell that the pearl wasn’t ordinary. If Zhao Feng didn’t have that pearl, he probably wouldn’t dare to obstruct him.

“Flower Burial!” Lin Yun waved his hand, summoning his sword. When he grabbed the sword, a dazzling brilliance shined out of him. As he began to hover in the sky, sword intent began to gush out from his pores. He was causing heaven and earth to tremble violently.

Lin Yun’s sky sword intent at greater mastery shocked everyone. When Lin Yun swung his sword, he knocked aside all the spiritual runes and charged towards Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng’s face changed because he could sense that he could no longer control the pearl anymore. Throwing up a mouthful of blood, Zhao Feng unleashed all of his origin energy, “Die!”

As the Fire Spiritual Pearl flew towards Lin Yun, it looked like a comet streaking across the horizon. Under the Fire Spiritual Pearl, space was being suppressed and made Lin Yun slow down.

“What a terrifying pearl!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I heard that it’s not easy to refine the Fire Spiritual Pearl. Even if this pearl only has one percent of its original power, it’s still more than enough to suppress Lin Yun.” Everyone’s faces changed, but they were confused by Lin Yun. Clearly, Lin Yun wasn’t stopping despite the pressure.

They were shocked that the Fire Spiritual Pearl didn’t even deter Lin Yun. Just as the pearl was about to descend, Lin Yun swung his sword. Immediately, blood splashed everywhere as the purple-clothed youth was decapitated. Just like that, the first ranked cultivator on the purple ranking had died.

But the entire world was still trembling as the Fire Spiritual Pearl descended onto Lin Yun. Luo Chen’s group of three exclaimed because they could tell that Lin Yun was about to be heavily injured. “Not good!”

It wouldn’t be a piece of good news if Lin Yun was heavily injured the moment he stepped out of the city. But before Lin Yun would make a move, a black figure flashed past him and devoured the Fire Spiritual Pearl. Then, it landed on Lin Yun’s shoulder. Everyone was surprised by the fat cat.

Lin Yun turned around and glanced briefly at Lil’ Red. He knew that many people were aiming for him, so he spoke coldly, “Death to those who stand in my way!”
