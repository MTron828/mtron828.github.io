Chapter 2380 - Curtain Falls

When the four lotuses shone brightly, the spots for the Heavenly Barren Banquet were finally determined. Next to the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, Profound Sky Venerable spoke out, “The spots for the Heavenly Barren Banquet have been determined. Lin Yun, Ao Jue, Xiong Tiannan, and Lin Jiangxian will receive the qualifications to participate. Since everyone else was defeated or gave up, the five other quotas will remain empty.”

Everything had come to an end, but everyone was shocked. No one expected an outcome where five out of ten spots would be empty because this had never happened before.

“Holy shit, they’re all from Lin Yun’s group!”

“Ji Zixi’s spot also came from Lin Yun, not to mention Xiong Tiannan, Ao Jue, and Lin Jiangxian.”

“Lin Yun got the spots for them all by himself!”

“He’s really going to reforge the Kunlun Realm’s glory!”

“I bet the Heavenly Barren Banquet will be exciting, and we can go take a look if we have time.”

“Flower Burial’s talent in the sword is unrivaled in the three thousand realms!”

Everyone looked at Lin Yun with admiration before looking at Ji Zixi, Lin Jiangtian, Xiong Tiannan, and Ao Jue with envy.

Xiong Tiannan felt as though he was dreaming, and he smiled, “If the old man knew that someone who’s ranked at the bottom of the Brandished Dragon Ranking like me can participate in the Heavenly Barren Banquet, his jaw would probably drop.”

“I can’t believe it, either,” Ao Jue smiled. They knew that they relied on Lin Yun to participate in the Heavenly Barren Banquet, and they had received a huge benefit. It might be impossible for them to become the ancestral deity’s disciple, but the ancestral deity would reward them greatly for entering the banquet. Just the fruits and wines alone would be unimaginable in the outside world.

“Brother Lin, thanks,” Lin Jiangxian said. Ao Jue and Xiong Tiannan also came to thank Lin Yun.

“No worries,” Lin Yun smiled. He continued, “What are friends for?”

Everyone turned to look at Profound Sky Venerable, who said, “You guys will have to stay here for another month. You can go into seclusion or look for treasures. If you want to make an exchange for treasures, you can look for the Heaven’s Gate elder in Heavenly Barren City.”

Everyone rejoiced after hearing what he said. Anyone who could come here were geniuses, and they had a lot of treasures on them that they didn’t need. But if they secretly exchanged the treasures, it wouldn’t be safe. However, it was different if Heaven’s Gate was managing the transactions.

Everyone cupped their fists, “Thank you, Venerable!”

Profound Sky Venerable smiled, “You guys can leave first. I still have some words to tell those participating in the Heavenly Barren Banquet.”

The other cultivators left since they only had one month left. Very quickly, Lin Yun’s group were the only ones left behind.

“You guys are to gather here a month from now, then I will bring you to the Heavenly Barren Banquet,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

Lin Yun nodded, and asked, “Where’s the Heavenly Barren Banquet located?”

“Heaven’s Gate Ancestral Ground,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled.

Lin Yun knew that he would arrive at the three thousand realms for real. He asked, “I have a question. Can the ancestral deity help me return to the Kunlun Realm?”

“It won’t be easy. Even if it’s an Ancestral Stage expert, it’s hard for them to suppress the Kunlun Realm’s heavenly dao. When the Kunlun Realm’s Heavenly Path was severed, it was isolated from the outside world,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that. Does that mean that I won’t be able to return any more? Although he had considered that outcome, he still held some hope. So he finally lost his composure after hearing what Profound Sky Venerable said.

“Brother Lin, there’s no need for you to return. With your strength and talent, you can grow faster in the three thousand realms,” Xiong Tiannan said.

Lin Yun bitterly smiled but said nothing else.

“Big Brother Lin has a reason to go back no matter what,” Ji Zixi said.

“If it’s that easy to go to the Kunlun Realm, it would’ve long been occupied by the Demonsprit Clan. You’re only a Saint, so you might still have a chance to return,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

Hope rose in Lin Yun’s heart as his face became better.

“You bluffed me, right? You have already refined the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet,” Profound Sky Venerable said, looking at Lin Yun.

“Well, I haven’t refined it yet,” Lin Yun smiled. It was too precious, and he also didn’t know how to refine it.

“How is that possible?” Profound Sky Venerable was shocked. He asked, “How did your Azure Dragon Divine Physique become so powerful without refining it? That’s impossible... You’ve gone through the Dragon Tribulation?”

He decided that he had to make Lin Yun stay in Heaven’s Gate no matter what. If Lin Yun stayed in Heaven’s Gate, they would have another young Emperor in just fifty years. Just thinking about it was enough to make Profound Sky Venerable excited.

“I haven’t experienced the Dragon Tribulation yet, nor have I refined the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet. So I have to seek guidance from you,” Lin Yun said.

“It’s nothing,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled. He didn’t hide anything as he told Lin Yun about how to refine the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet along with the Azure Dragon Tribulation. He smiled, “Don’t return to the city for the next month. Instead, cultivate here. This place is filled with saint aura since this was where Emperors went into seclusion. You can refine the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet here. If the Dragon Tribulation arrives, I can look after you.”

Profound Sky Venerable continued, “You don’t have to worry about the Dao Sect, Heavenly Sword Pavilion, and Shadow Divine Palace here. Heaven’s Gate can protect you! With Heaven's Gate around, we won’t allow those from the older generations bully you.”

“Thank you,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Haha, it’s nothing.” Profound Sky Venerable stroked his beard with a smile, before he continued, “You have given me a huge surprise, and I believe that you can shine brightly at the Heavenly Barren Banquet.”

Everyone left after briefly chatting. Leaving the stage, Lin Jiangxian said, “I know two methods to return to the Kunlun Realm.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up as he looked at Lin Jiangxian.

“First is the ancient teleportation array. When the Kunlun Realm was in its prime, there were many ancient teleportation arrays. It might be hard to find them, but there are some that are still around and intact. So you can return to the Kunlun Realm if you find a way,” Lin Jiangxian said. “The first one might be dangerous since it has been too long, and no one can ensure that the teleportation array is safe. But the second method is less risky.”

“What method is it?” Ji Zixi asked.

“If an Ancestral Stage expert is willing to pay a price, they can send Lin Yun back to the Kunlun Realm. Lin Yun is only a Saint Lord, and he is from the Kunlun Realm, to begin with. So, the Kunlun Realm’s heavenly dao won’t reject you,” Lin Jiangxian said.

“But Profound Sky Venerable said...” Lin Yun was baffled.

“What he said isn’t entirely false. It’s hard for others to go to the Kunlun Realm, and even Ancestral Stage experts can’t forcibly go there,” Lin Jiangxian said. “But Ancestral Realm experts can easily crush deities, and they far exceed our imagination. With the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity’s strength, he can send you back to the Kunlun Realm. The venerable said that probably because he wants you to stay in Heaven’s Gate.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled and heaved a sigh in relief.

Ao Jue smiled, “That’s normal. If I was Profound Sky Venerable, I wouldn’t want you to return, either. Your talent is visible, and you will become an Emperor within a hundred years,” Ao Jue smiled.

“But it’s hard to make an Ancestral Stage expert help you, not to mention that we might not see the ancestral deity himself at the banquet,” Xiong Tiannan said.

Lin Jiangxian said, “You don’t have to worry about that. My master is a deity, and he has a good friend who has grasped Time and Space Daos. He might not be comparable to Ancestral Stage experts, but he can send you back.”

Ji Zixi smiled as she held onto Lin Yun’s hand, “Big Sister Lin is the best!”

“If Young Master Lin returns, what will you do then?” Lin Jiangxian asked with a smile.

“I...” Ji Zixi was stumped.

“If I can return, I will reforge the Heavenly Path sooner or later,” Lin Yun said.

“I believe in Big Brother Lin!” Ji Zixi looked at Lin Yun.

“Lin Yun, why are you in such a hurry to return? Cultivating in Heaven’s Gate is better than the Kunlun Realm, right?” Xiong Tiannan asked.

Lin Yun didn’t hide it from Xiong Tiannan and explained his situation. He wanted to witness his master’s tribulation, not to mention that many people were waiting for him, such as Su Ziyao and Yue Weiwei.

“Yeah, you should return,” Xiong Tiannan said.

“I’m surprised there are so many experts even when the Heavenly Path is severed. It looks like the Kunlun Realm is more terrifying than we thought; there must be many secrets and opportunities,” Ao Jue said.

“The Kunlun Realm was a Sovereign Realm back then, so it’s not surprising. You just can’t reach the Deity Realm with the Heavenly Path severed. But because of this reason, there are more Emperors and Saints than in the outside world,” Lin Jiangxian analyzed. She continued, “As long as the Heavenly Path can be reforged, the Kunlun Realm will return to its prime.”

Lin Yun was shocked as he looked at Lin Jiangxian. He might not believe it if someone else said it, but Lin Jiangxian was different. For some reason, he believed in what she said. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xiong Tiannan scratched his head, and smiled, “You put it in a way that makes even me want to go to the Kunlun Realm. I heard that there are more inheritances and opportunities than in the outside world.”

“Me too,” Ao Jue smiled.

“It would be my honor,” Lin Yun said. If they were willing to go to the Kunlun Realm, it would be the same as having a few more helpers for him.
