Chapter 898 - Hidden Treasure Pavilion

Three days later in the ruins, over thirty Gold Flowlight Lamps were in front of Lin Yun. Most of them were white and blue while a few were purple. Up to this point, Lin Yun had only encountered one gold one.

Half of the Gold Flowlight Lamps were found by him and the other half were from people he had killed. Simultaneously, his astral pellets had reached an astronomical sum of 1,300,000. His huge harvest left him shocked and he understood why geniuses from higher realms were so brutal.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After all, it was faster to kill others for their astral pellets than to refine them. But Lin Yun only killed those who provoked him.

Lin Yun placed the sword box down and opened it. Flower petals started flying around and enveloped him as he reached for the Flower Burial Sword. At this moment, Lin Yun saw more natural runes on the sword after it had been nourished by the floral fragrance. The dao rhythm in the sword made it feel like it was about to awaken.

“These runes look like naturally formed spiritual runes,” muttered Lin Yun while examining the sword. As a natural metallic wood, the sword needed tempering to become spiritual. After all, it had been the king of swords in the past even though it declined over time.

“I bet you’ll have the grace of a king after reaching the height of a dao artifact.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with anticipation. With many Gold Flowlight Lamps, the Flower Burial Sword should easily upgrade to a dao artifact.

Sheathing the sword, Lin Yun crushed all of the Gold Flowlight Lamps and placed them into his sword box. But just when he was about to carry his sword box, the ground started trembling violently as he heard a loud boom.

The sound came from afar, but it still entered his ears. The tremor of the ground was also terrifying as Lin Yun had trouble stabilizing himself.

“Is a treasure emerging?” Lin Yun looked towards a direction and fell into deep thoughts. He was witnessing a familiar scene when a palace was emerging.

Over the past few days, he had seen many similar events, but he was too busy collecting the Gold Flowlight Lamps to be bothered with the treasures. Now that he had gathered enough flowers, he could join in on the fun. Plus, this was the first time he felt such a powerful tremor.

“I should go take a look.” After making up his mind, a lightning tornado lifted him off the ground. He travelled at a fast speed, but even so, the journey took half an hour.

A huge crater on the ground with a three story tall stone pavilion rose from the ground. It towered over the surroundings at nearly 1,000 meters. But since the highest part of the pavilion was destroyed, the pavilion was probably taller than three stories during ancient times. Additionally, it was rare that a pavilion could be maintained so well after so many years.

Up to this point, he hadn’t seen any buildings that were taller than two stories in Flamefeather City. The building was probably a clan’s Hidden Treasure Pavilion, which was the foundation of any clan.

When Lin Yun got close, he noticed that many people were gathered around the pavilion. Clearly, they were also shocked by the pavilion as they started fighting even before the stone gate opened.

“What qualifications do you have to enter? The Hidden Treasure Pavilion was discovered by my Desolatemount Realm!”

“Haha, what’s so impressive about your Desolatemount Realm? You think having two first soul Heavenly Soul Realm can compete with my Soarwind Realm?”

“Dream on. Everyone has a chance at this treasure. No one can think of monopolizing it!” WIth those words, a new intensity filled everyone’s eyes.

When Lin Yun descended to the ground, he examined everyone who was fighting. Once he was 100 meters away, everyone stopped and stared at him.

“Where did that brat come from? He wants to take part in the Flamefeather City when he’s only in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm?”

“He must be insane to enter the Hidden Treasure Pavilion with all of us here. Does he think that we’re invisible?”

“He’s just a piece of trash. Why bother talking so much when you can just kill him?” Although the battles weren’t done, anyone who entered the stone gate would become public enemy number one.

Lin Yun merely sneered when he heard their words. If he didn’t want to cause unnecessary slaughter, everyone present would be dead by now. If anyone dared to provoke him, he wouldn’t mind using them to test the sharpness of the Flower Burial Sword.

“Get lost!” Right at this moment, a rumbling voice echoed out that made everyone’ heart sink.

“A bunch of ants.” When the voice sounded out, a gigantic purple fist appeared. The wrist was shrouded in blazing flames made of chains that made everyone nervous.

When a booming sound rang out, dozens of people died from the impact of the fist hitting the ground. Only about ten first soul Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses managed to stay on their feet. At this moment, the commotion had calmed down.

“What power!” Lin Yun raised his brow because the power behind this punch was terrifying. If his speculation was right, the one that just arrived was a genius from the higher realms.

“Higher realm!”

“It’s a genius from the higher realm…”

“It’s Chen Qiong of the Violetyang Realm!”

“Quick, leave!” Those who were sent flying away were suddenly enveloped with fear as they began to run for their lives. By now, everyone in Flamefeather City knew how terrifying the higher realms were.

Only a few first soul Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses stayed behind with flickering eyes. It wouldn’t be that easy to make them give up.

As the cloud of dust slowly settled down, a purple-clothed figure slowly walked over. It was Chen Qiong of the Violetyang Realm. Along with his arrival was a crushing pressure that made it difficult for everyone to stand

“Let’s go!” Several people’s faces changed under the terrifying pressure and quickly retreated. In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun was the only one left behind.

As for Lil’ Red, it rummaged through the corpses with a bunch of interspatial pouches in its mouth. Occasionally, it would even throw away some items from the pouch. Since following Lin Yun, Lil’ Red had also started to become picky. Occasionally, disdain would fill its eyes when examining the pouches. At times, it would also grin when examining the pouches.

After Lil’ Red was done collecting the interspatial pouches on the ground, it swallowed the pouches. This scene shocked those who had run away. “I-Is that brat insane?”

“My heavens. Not only did he stay, but he even dared to let his pet gather the interspatial pouches on the ground!”

“Damn it! That Dragon-blooded Cat is too despicable!” Many people were enraged because some of the corpses on the ground were their companions. However, their companions were raided by the shabby looking Dragon-blooded Cat.

Chen Qiong swept his glance at the corpses on the ground before turning to look at Lil’ Red and Lin Yun. With surprise in his eyes, he asked, “Why are you still here? Are you courting death?”

In his mind, someone in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm was trash among trash. Not only did Lin Yun stay behind, he even dared to let his pet collect the interspatial pouches on the ground. Clearly, the interspatial pouches were his trophies that he wouldn’t let anyone touch.

With no changes on his face, Lin Yun replied calmly, “The Hidden Treasure Pavilion hasn’t opened yet. So why do I have to leave?”

Lin Yun’s words instantly caused a huge uproar. Everyone was shocked by Lin Yun’s courage. Not only did Lin Yun collect all the interspatial pouches on the ground, he actually wanted to enter the Hidden Treasure Pavilion.

Chen Qiong squinted his eyes coldly and sneered, “I can sense a powerful sword intent coming from you. But it’s a pity that you have no idea how terrifying the higher realms are. Your so-called geniuses mean nothing to me.”

“Cut the crap and make your move.” Lin Yun didn’t want to waste time chatting. The higher realms were arrogant and always thought they were the best if they weren’t taught a lesson.
