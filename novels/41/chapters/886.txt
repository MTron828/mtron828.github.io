Chapter 887 - Glorysun Spirit

The power behind the palm was unbelievable. Even though Lin Yun cautiously followed Qin Feng, he was still caught by surprise.

The wind rumbled like lightning in Lin Yun’s ears as his hair fluttered wildly. The pressure from the palm instantly suppressed the origin energy within his body. If he wanted to break through the seal with his two sword sutras, it would require a single breath’s time. But that much time could kill him.

Is this the power of the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm? Someone who had gone through the tribulation was really terrifying.

In a split second, Lin Yun drew his sword by an inch. Then, boundless starlight poured out that tore apart the pressure coming from the assailant’s palm. Immediately, Lin Yu circulated both of his sword sutras at the same time.

This was a risky method because he knew that if his sword aura couldn’t tear apart his assailant’s pressure, he would die. But fortunately, his gamble was successful. When he held onto the Flower Burial Sword, the origin energy in his body surged out.

When the sword and palm collided, the Flower Burial Sword began to bend from the pressure. But when the sword became straight again, an even more powerful sword aura hit the palm. This surprised the assailant and forced them to quickly back off. Then, Lin Yun got a good look at his assailant. It was a black-clothed youth in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm with an indifferent expression.

“Brother Yan, what did I tell you? Lin Yun can easily take your palm.” Qin Feng appeared once more with an indifferent smile on his face.

Lin Yun knew that the youth was probing his strength. Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun looked at the black-clothed youth with a playful smile.

The black-clothed youth’s eyes flashed coldly and his face kept changing before he spoke out, “You’re indeed capable of being able to kill Feng Xuan. I take back what I said earlier.”

At this moment, he was holding his hand behind his back since it was dripping with blood. Even though Lin Yun knew that the black-clothed youth was probably probing him, he didn’t hold back. Now that Qin Feng appeared, there was nothing the black-clothed youth could do but to suck it up.

Qin Feng smiled, “Brother Lin, I apologize for what just happened. This is Brother Yan Kui from the Lightflow Realm. He simply wanted to test your strength. Don’t take it to heart.”

“I’m fine,” said Lin Yun calmly with a smile since he wasn’t the one who suffered a loss.

“Brother Lin, you just arrived in Thunderflame City. I wonder if you’ve heard of the Glorysun Spirit?” Qin Feng got straight to the point.

Qin Feng’s words caused a fluctuation in Lin Yun’s heart because Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan also brought up the Glorysun Spirit before. However, they didn’t have many details on it. Lin Yun came to Thunderflame City to deal with Flamecloud Realm and to find out more about the Glorysun Realm.

“Yes, but I don’t know much about it,” replied Lin Yun.

Qin Feng and Yan Kui exchanged a glance before they smiled, “It’s a long story. In a nutshell, the Heavenly Path is divided into four regions: azure dragon, vermillion bird, black tortoise, and white tiger. But as long as you go straight, you’ll ultimately reach the end of the Heavenly Path.

“Each region has an ancient treasure known as the four forbidden realms. To open the realm, four astral spirits need to be gathered. It can be gold, wood, water, fire, earth, sun, or the moon.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that and asked, “So the Glorysun Land has the Glorysun Spirit, the Gloryfire Land has the Gloryfire Spirit and so on…?”

“You catch on quick. It might sound complicated, but it’s pretty simple. Each district has seven astral lands and each land has an astral spirit that resides in it. We’re in the Azure Dragon Region, and the Glorysun Spirit can be found in this Glorysun Land.”

“So the two of you know where the Glorysun Spirit is?” Lin Yun asked.

Nodding his head, Qin Feng replied, “News from the top-tier intermediate realms three days ago is that everyone in Glorysun Land is recruiting men. I’m not going to hide it from you. Feng Xuan was recruited by us.”

Lin Yun realized why Yan Kui and Qin Feng were examining him.

“But we never expected that Feng Xuan would die,” continued Qin Feng as he looked at Lin Yun deeply.

“So the two of you want revenge?” Lin Yun raised his brow with a playful smile.

“Of course not. Brother Lin, you must be joking. Feng Xuan didn’t have a good reputation around here since he occupied strongholds and took advantage of those from the lower realm. But Feng Xuan did have some strength and out of everyone in Thunderflame City, he had the highest chance of overcoming the tribulation.”

Based on Qin Feng and Yan Kui’s expressions, they didn’t seem to be lying. If they really did pay great importance to Feng Xuan, they simply needed to leak out a wisp of their killing intent and they would have rescued Feng Xuan from Lin Yun.

Furthermore, Lin Yun didn’t want to make an enemy out of a first soul Heavenly Soul Realm for now. Although he wasn’t afraid of them with the Indigoflame Thunderwhip, trump cards were trump cards only if they were hidden.

“The place where the Glorysun Spirit will be born has countless treasures such as greater fortune martial techniques, spiritual pellets, artifacts, and even divine runes. Additionally, there will be a rare flower every time the astral spirit is born. The one that comes with the Glorysun Spirit is the Gold Lightflow Lamp…”

“Gold Lightflow Lamp?” Lin Yun was intrigued because it was an extremely rare flower. It was a legendary flower in the Profound Amber Realm that couldn’t be found anywhere.

All cultivators were attracted to the flower because refining one petal would guarantee a breakthrough in cultivation. If the flower was old enough, it could even break the bottleneck above the Heavenly Soul Realm. Furthermore, this was a great source of nourishment to fire attributed cultivators.

To Lin Yun, the flower was important because it had been a long time since he nourished his Flower Burial Sword. With this flower, he might even be able to upgrade his sword to a dao artifact. Lin Yun’s heart throbbed violently at this moment as it was a temptation that he couldn’t resist. From a certain perspective, the Flower Burial Sword was an extension of his life.

Qin Feng was surprised because he never expected that the usually calm Lin Yun would get so emotional after hearing the Gold Lightflow Lamp. But when he thought of Lin Yun cultivating the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm, he instantly understood the excitement.

Lin Yun’s talent was a lot stronger than Feng Xuan, so he must be using the Gold Lightflow Lamp to take another step in his Flamecloud Incinerating Palm. At the very least, he might be able to upgrade the greater fortune martial technique to the manifestation stage.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Thinking about it, Qing Feng smiled, “The Gold Lightflow Lamp doesn’t have much use to us. But there will be many geniuses from different realms gathered, so it won’t be easy to obtain.”

Lin Yun took a deep breath to calm himself down. He knew that he had lost control over his emotions because of the Golden Lightflow Lamp. But that didn’t matter because the Flower Burial Sword was important to him. Anyhow, Qin Feng and Yan Kui definitely wouldn’t be able to guess the actual reason why he needed the flower.

After some small talk, Qin Feng officially extended an invitation to Lin Yun. “Brother Lin, we’ll be heading there seven days from now. If you’re willing, you can come with us.”

“Since the two of you are willing to invite me, I naturally have no reason to refuse,” smiled Lin Yun while cupping his hands together.

Watchin Lin Yun leaving, Qin Feng’s smile gradually faded away and Yan Kui’s gaze also became grave. A long time later, Yan Kui spoke, “This fellow is interesting. He makes it sound like we’re begging him to come along with us. Feng Xuan was just a dog in our eyes and he didn’t dare to show any arrogance.”

Qin Feng glanced at Yan Kui and smiled, “This is unlike you. In the past, you wouldn’t hold back if you were unhappy.”

Yan Kui didn’t reply and merely revealed the wound in his palm.

“You’re injured?” Qin Feng’s face changed as he realized that Yan Kui suffered an injury while probing Lin Yun’s strength. If that was the case, then Lin Yun was a monster. After all, the physique of someone who overcame their tribulation was far greater than those who hadn’t. How was it possible that Lin Yun actually managed to injure Yan Kui?

Although Yan Kui didn’t use his full strength, Lin Yun was only in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm.

“Let’s try not to make him our enemy. He’ll be even more terrifying when he reaches the Heavenly Soul Realm,” said Qin Feng with a grave expression.

Yan Kui, on the other hand, wasn’t too bothered by it and smiled, “He’s not in the Heavenly Soul Realm right now. Plus, he still has a long way to go for the tribulation. It’s impossible for him to take over and he’ll need to rely on us. Someone like him is suitable for us to control.”
