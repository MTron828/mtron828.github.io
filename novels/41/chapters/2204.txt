Chapter 2205 - No Fear!

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had activated the Emperor Sword Array on the altar. The altar gave off a golden radiance that soon enveloped the entire plaza. The spectacular scene of the ceremony that day reappeared, but the situation was different this time.

Beneath the golden clouds, there was a golden energy barrier that enveloped everyone in it, and there were fine scriptures on the barrier that gave everyone peace of mind. This array was activated with the blood of Saints, and it was naturally powerful with various phenomena beginning to appear.

Dozens of low-grade dragon spirit martial techniques were released by Saints that unleashed a shockwave. It was the Ye Clan and Wang Clan who had arrived first. They took the lead and wanted to destroy the Emperor Sword Array before it was completely deployed.

But before their attacks could get close, sword rays exploded from the Emperor Sword Array, destroying all the incoming attacks before they could reach the golden barrier.

“Charge!” Stun Yang Saint Sovereign led the Saint Sovereigns of the Wang Clan and dashed forth with cold light flashing in their eyes as they released their constellations with countless saint daos appearing. They reached the barrier in the blink of an eye as they brandished their saint artifacts to block the sword rays.

But just when they were about to get close to the energy barrier, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint suddenly opened her eyes on the altar. The moment she opened her eyes, a sword vibration echoed that traveled through ancient times with a sword aura comparable to the Emperor Realm swept out. With a glance, several Saint Sovereigns were repelled.

As they threw out a mouthful of blood, their faces became pale, and all the Saints had fear on their faces, not daring to take another step forth. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint activated the Emperor Sword Array herself.

This scene made the remaining four Great Saints breathe a sigh of relief because they knew that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had succeeded. The Thousand Plume Great Saint said, “Everyone, please take your positions at the nodes and don’t move.”

He nearly died during the day, and Tian Xuanzi’s attack had injured his Saint Soul. But it didn’t shatter his Saint Soul, which preserved his life. This was why he could plot a scheme against the Gale Rein Great Saint.

But he didn’t expect the Gale Rein Great Saint to have a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit with him, completely resolving his schemes. If the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint didn’t hold back the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit, all the Great Saints would have probably lost their lives in the Dao Yang Palace.

This was because the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit was powerful, and he wasn’t at all weaker than Tian Xuanzi. The latter was known to be invincible beneath the Saint Realm, so one could imagine how terrifying the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit was.

Not to mention, the Blood Moon Sect’s sect master had sent a clone over. The two joining forces made it hard for them to feel assured, and the pressure was too great.

Outside the plaza, the red-clothed youth and Golden-Eyed Demonspirit hovered in the air as they looked at the Emperor Sword Array with their brows locked together. After knowing that the Solar Divine Rune was within Bai Shuying, the faces of the Gale Rein Great Saint and Golden-Eyed Demonspirit became ugly.

They gathered into a group with an overwhelming advantage in the number of Saints. But they were led by the red-clothed youth and the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit because everyone present was much weaker, including the Gale Rein Great Saint.

Seeing that Saint Sovereigns couldn’t break the Emperor Sword Array; the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit and red-clothed youth couldn’t keep watching any longer.

“Star Asura King, will you go first or should I go first?” The red-clothed youth was acquainted with the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit and called the latter by his title.

The Golden-Eyed Demonspirit was of the royal clan amongst the Demonspirit Clan, and they would have a title due to their noble bloodlines. Only the Imperial Clans could suppress them.

The Star Asura King’s eyes flashed as he smiled, “You can go ahead. The key to this array is the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. With her at the altar, this is equivalent to taking the spot of the Emperor Sword, and it’s futile for others to go up.”

“The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint cannot be underestimated. After all, she’s on the same level as the Radiant Sword Saint and is known as one of the Three Sword Saints of the Eastern Desolation,” the red-clothed youth said. He would have a headache whenever it was something involving the Radiant Sword Saint.

“That’s not the same. The Radiant Sword Saint’s attainment in the sword has long thrown her behind, but he’s too ambitious. This is why he can’t break into the Emperor Realm,” the Star Asura King said.

The red-clothed youth didn’t refute those words since he could barely be considered to be from the same generation as the Radiant Sword Saint. Even if he had become an Emperor, the Radiant Sword Saint still hadn’t become an Emperor. This meant the Radiant Sword Saint was ambitious and it had nothing to do with talent or resources.

“How do you intend on breaking the array?” The Star Asura King asked with a hint of curiosity.

“Using sword against sword.” The red-clothed youth used his fingers as a sword and his fingers began to shine with a crimson radiance. When the crimson radiance spread, a thousand miles in radius turned red without any other colors.

The heaven and earth began to tremble the next moment as the red-clothed youth released a terrifying sword intent from his fingers, and he was like a sword brewing his might. Under the aura that he gave off, the entire plaza began to tremble, and all the Saints in the nodes of the Emperor Sword Array were under great pressure, with their lips trembling.

“Emperor aura…” They couldn’t help becoming nervous because an Emperor could easily crush Saints. Even if a clone released the aura, it still made all the Saints feel great pressure.

Lin Yun also became nervous because he could sense the immense pressure even if he wasn’t on the node. Is this the power of an Emperor? He soon thought of Yu Qingfeng. Since a clone of the Blood Moon Sect’s sect master was already so powerful, just how powerful the Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng had to be?Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

His master wanted to fight with Yu Qingfeng, so just how terrifying would his master’s tribulation become?

“Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, I have a sword that I wish you to experience!” The red-clothed youth was enveloped in a domineering aura, his hair fluttering in the wind and looking arrogant. The crimson radiance on his fingertips finally exploded as it shot to the sky in the shape of a crimson sword ray, shattering the thirty-six layers of heaven.

Before the sword ray descended, many Saints on the nodes threw out a mouthful of blood as they were sent flying away. The aura of an Emperor was too powerful, and it had inflicted heavy injuries on them through the Emperor Sword Array.

The Emperor Sword Array became dim, and the sword aura released by it began to fall. But the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint clasped her hands together at the critical moment and a blurred white figure soared to the sky.

This figure was shining brightly. It was white, looking pure and sacred. This was the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s Saint Soul, which reached a hundred feet as the Saint Soul reached down.

A sword ray streaked across the sky and was held by the Saint Soul. When the Saint Soul held onto the sword, a terrifying emperor aura swept out from the Saint Soul before she swung the sword out, releasing a sword ray that reached close to a hundred feet, blocking the red-clothed youth’s sword containing emperor aura.

When the two sword rays came into contact, fine cracks appeared in the surrounding space, followed by an outburst of energy. At the same time, the plaza shone again as the Emperor Sword Array stood firmly once more.

“This is the Emperor Sword?” Lin Yun asked in a shocked tone.

“That’s an image of the Emperor Sword, and you can treat it as the Emperor Sword’s clone,” the Dao Yang Holy Son said with a grave expression beside Lin Yun.

But that wasn’t all. The Star Asura King made his move. His vertical eye opened, and the ancient rune in the eye began to ignite. Cracks began to appear in the sky above him as a vertical eye reaching close to a hundred feet appeared.

In the next second, a golden beam shot out from the eye, igniting the air particles as it shot towards the Saint Soul.

“Firefly Radiance!” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said as the Emperor Sword released a faint firefly’s radiance. As the Emperor Sword swung out, all the crimson radiance that enveloped a thousand miles in radius disappeared, and the golden beam was stopped from far away. The sword easily shattered the golden beam before gently stabbing into the eye that opened up in the space.

The Star Asura King’s face changed as he quickly shut his vertical eye. But he was still one step slower, and his face was distorted with pain for a long time.

“It looks like it won’t work. Even if it’s an image of the Emperor Sword, it’s too hard to break it,” the red-clothed youth said as he landed beside the Star Asura King with no surprise on his face.

“What should we do now?” The Star Asura King’s lips twitched because the blazing pain from his forehead was terrible.

“It looks like we can’t take down the Heavenly Dao Sect. But we don’t necessarily have to destroy the Emperor Sword Array if we want to take that lass with us.” The red-clothed youth looked through the golden barrier and his gaze fell onto everyone on the plaza. The four Great Saints in the array were practically helpless, and the Saint Sovereigns were also injured. As for the Saint Lords, all of them had nearly fainted from what happened earlier.

“You go hold down the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s Saint Soul. I’ll tear a hole and send a few Saint Lords in. Everything will be fine as long as we can bring that girl out,” the red-clothed youth revealed his plan.

The Star Asura King feared the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, so he didn’t immediately agree to it. After all, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was a Great Saint, and the Emperor’s Sword’s image empowered her, so it was hard for him to hold his ground.

“I’ll come and help you after tearing a hole,” the red-clothed youth said.

“Okay.” The Star Asura King no longer dwelled on it and the vertical eye opened. He then charged at the Saint Soul.

The red-clothed youth closed his eyes and his emperor aura began to climb. A few minutes later, he opened his eyes and spread his arms apart.

“Moon Picking Hand!” A crimson moon rose in his palm.

“Go!” The red-clothed youth waved his hand, and the crimson moon flew down, smashing into the golden barrier like an actual planet.

“Now” The Wang Clan’s Saints, who had been waiting for a long time, charged forth, heading for the plaza.

Under the impact of the crimson moon, cracks began to appear on the golden barrier. Although those cracks were swiftly recovering, the red-clothed youth spread his hand apart and injected his saint aura into it, opening the crack again.

As the crack exploded and recovered, the Saints at the nodes were bearing a huge pressure, even when they were heavily injured, to begin with, and they were beginning to exhaust their life span.

Most of the Wang Clan’s Saints were knocked back by the saint aura, but some managed to enter the plaza.

Right then, a sword ray descended from the sky and severed the crimson moon into two, alleviating the pressure of the Saints on the nodes.

The damages swiftly recovered as the Emperor Sword Array recovered, and the other Saints were stopped outside. That sword ray naturally came from the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, who divided her heart into two and resolved this crisis.

“That’s enough,” the red-clothed youth sneered with satisfaction. He managed to send in four Saint Lords earlier, so it should be enough to bring the lass from the Bai Clan out.

“Star Asura King, I’ll come and help you!” The red-clothed youth laughed as he charged at the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s Saint Soul. This time, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint couldn’t be bothered about the condition of the plaza any longer.

“Split up!” The Wang Clan’s Saint Lord, who entered, charged with no one capable of stopping him. The Saints from the Zhang and Bai Clans wanted to stop him, but they were sent flying after a few exchanges. The Saints of the two clans were already injured from the battle at the Nether Orchid Courtyard, so they could do nothing to this Saint lord.

“Horizon Hawk Saint Lord, we have been in the same sect for hundreds of years!” A Saint Lord of the Bai Clan looked at the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord with a hint of anger.

“Sorry, but I have always been a Saint Elder of the Blood Moon Sect,” the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord sneered as he punched at that Saint’s chest before reaching out for Bai Shuying.

Under pressure from a Saint, Bai Shuying and those around her were immobilized. They were only at the Quasi-Saint Realm and couldn't withstand a Saint’s aura.

But a sword vibration echoed right then as a figure stood up and appeared before Bai Shuying. This person was naturally Lin Yun.

But before Lin Yun’s sword aura could reach the peak, he was sent flying by the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord, throwing out a mouthful of blood as he fell onto one knee.

“You think you can slay a Saint because you’re the Heavenly Dragon Lord? How ignorant!” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord sneered with contempt in his eyes. Even if a Quasi-Saint was strong, a Quasi-Saint was still a Quasi-Saint.

Not to mention that Ye Qingtian was merely a Quasi-Saint who hadn’t even ignited his sacred flame, and there was no need for the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord to pay attention to him. The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord couldn’t even be bothered to take another glance at Ye Qingtian as his gaze fell onto Bai Shuying, waving his hand and wanting to take her away.

Bai Shuying was feeling nervous as she became immobilized under the saint aura. This was the suppression from a Saint.

But the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord didn’t notice that Ye Qingtian had a firm gaze and a hint of stubbornness. There wasn’t a hint of fear on his face as his gaze became ruthless, and he charged forth. As he ran, he began forming seals with his hands, and he released a powerful dragon aura along with this Azure Dragon Divine Physique being activated.

The Blue Dragon Seal, Silver Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal, Indigo Dragon Seal, Green Dragon Seal, Red Dragon Seal… until he formed the Sovereign Dragon Seal.

By the time Lin Yun got close to the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord, a seven-colored radiance shone from his fist, containing an explosive power that even a Saint would be fearful of.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun soared to the sky and threw the Sovereign Dragon Seal at the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord. His gaze was cold and filled with madness.

So what if he was facing a Saint Lord? He had slain a Saint Lord while being at the Dragon Pulse Realm before, so why would he be afraid of one now?
