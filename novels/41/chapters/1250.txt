Chapter 1251 - Junior Brother is Right!

Lin Yun squinted his eyes when he heard that ranking and his gaze fell onto Qin Tian. This ranking was strong, and this meant that Qin Tian was even stronger than Gongsun Yan from the Sword Assembly. But why didn’t he feel that?

Facing Qin Tian didn’t have the pressure he felt when he faced Gongsun Yan. Lin Yun knew that if Gongsun Yan didn’t restrict his cultivation to the Heavenly Soul Realm back then, Lin Yun would definitely not be his opponent. But it was weird that he didn’t face any threat coming from Qin Tian.

If Zhang Ting didn’t say a word, he wouldn’t even know that Qin Tian was ranked in the nine hundredths. As Lin Yun examined Qin Tian, Lin Yun realized that he seemed to have grown stronger. After he figured out the reason, the doubt disappeared from his eyes and was replaced with excitement. He had never fought with an opponent of this caliber before, so he was looking forward to it.

“You’re afraid? It’s already too late!” Zhang Ting sneered while lying on the ground when he saw the changes in Lin Yun’s expression.

“Junior Brother, this fellow is really strong. Can you do it? If you can’t, then we can just retreat. It won’t embarrass the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect either way.” Jiang Lichen panicked because he knew how strong a genius ranked in the nine hundredth was on the Empyrean Ranking.

“Senior Brother, don’t panic. I’ve already said that no one can teach you a lesson no matter how weak you are,” smiled Lin Yun.

Hearing that made Jiang Lichen’s lips twitch and he knew that Lin Yun definitely did that on purpose. But his words made all the disciples of the Sword Sect grit their teeth.

“Senior Brother, teach him a lesson! Let him know how strong the Sword Sect is!”

“Yeah. Senior Brother, they’re already riding on our heads. We’ll be turned into tortoises if we continue to bear it!”

“Senior Brother, teach him a lesson!” Zhang Ting and the rest spoke up.

But Qin Tian had his eyes closed, as if he was hesitating. When he closed his eyes, his expression became calm, allowing the wind to blow on his hair.

Lin Yun was wondering what Qin Tian was trying to do. This person said he wanted to teach him a lesson, but he suddenly weny silent.

“This fellow looks really terrifying…” Jiang Lichen, on the other hand, was trembling in fear.

When Qin Tian suddenly opened his eyes, a cold aura swept out from his forehead that blew out like a wave. Under his aura, Jiang Lichen and the other disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect were forced to take several steps back.

Qin Tian’s gaze fell on Lin Yun and said, “I should’ve made my move against you, but I’m kind enough. If you can take ten moves from me, I’ll drop this matter. If you can’t, then I’ll let you know why not everyone can teach those from the Scarlet Firmament Peak a lesson!”

When he said that, the surrounding air began to buzz and the sword intent of many Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s disciples showed signs of collapsing.

When Jiang Lichen stabilized his footing, his expression became serious. But when his gaze fell onto Lin Yun, he saw that Lin Yun was merely casually standing there with a casual smile on his lips. This nearly drove Jiang Lichen insane and he wondered if Lin Yun was being serious about this. After all, Qin Tian was ranked the nine hundredths on the Empyrean Ranking.

Many Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s disciples could feel their scalps going numb as someone asked in a trembling voice, “Senior Brother, can Lin Yun do it?”

“I don’t think so.”

“Just Qin Tian’s aura alone is already so terrifying.” The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s disciples were all shocked by the aura that Qin Tian was giving off.

“He won’t lose terribly, right?” Jiang Lichen softly muttered to himself without any confidence.

Compared to the disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, those from the Sword Sect were more confident and the three who were lying on the ground also struggled to get on their feet. In their eyes, there was no way Lin Yun could win as long as their senior brother was willing to make a move.

Ten moves? It would be surprising to them if Lin Yun could even last more than five. At the same time, Ye Ziling and a group of people showed up. When Ye Ziling saw Lin Yun facing off against Qin Tian, she locked her brows together. Just when she wanted to step up to stop them, a woman beside her held onto her wrist.

“Let’s take a look. It’s rare to see Qin Tian fighting against someone from the same generation. Don’t worry about it, he won’t use his constellation.” The woman emitting elegance beside Ye Ziling smiled.

Ye Ziling merely glanced back at the woman. She wasn’t worried about Lin Yun but Qin Tian. But seeing the confidence written on the face of this woman, Ye Ziling also couldn’t be bothered to talk more about it.

As space suddenly trembled, a sword manifesting with astral energy appeared behind Qin Tian. This made Lin Yun surprised because he knew that it wasn’t easy to accomplish that, not to mention that the sword gave him a feeling that it was a genuine sword.

Just when his interest was piqued, astral energy surged within Qin Tian’s body and the sword behind him began to tremble. In the next moment, nine more swords appeared behind him that opened up like a fan.

When the ten swords appeared, Qin Tian’s sword aura suddenly exploded, as if every single sword could slice through a mountain. When they buzzed, they also caused the entire stage to start trembling.

“The first sword!” Qin Tian’s eyes flashed and he tapped his fingers. In the next second, a sword instantly pierced through space. Everything happened too quickly and a few strands of hair fell onto the ground after Lin Yun avoided the sword. But even when the sword plunged into the ground, it didn’t stop buzzing.

“Second sword!” Qin Tian waved his hand once more. This time, the attack was even more terrifying as the entire sky turned dark with lightning streaking across the horizon.

Executing the Golden Crow Nine Transformations, the afterimage left behind by Lin Yun was torn apart with a powerful gale sweeping out. Right at this moment, Qin Tian swiped his fingers out six times, causing the entire sky to change.

Everyone was shocked to discover that although Lin Yun kept moving around, his movement range was restricted to a small region. On the other hand, Qin Tian didn’t make a single move and even had his left hand behind him. Just like that, he easily forced Lin Yun into a terrible state.

After nine swords, Lin Yun was already out of places to dodge and the tenth sword flew over. But Lin Yun merely used his palm to grab onto the sword. Then again, the strong impact also made him take nine steps back.

Once he was stabilized, he was shocked to discover that he was surrounded by nine swords. The nine swords that were plunged into the ground began to buzz as they coiled around him. The nine swords looked like nine dragons that trapped Lin Yun within them, and the tenth sword was still held by Lin Yun’s hand, emitting a boundless sword aura.

“Good!”

“Senior Brother simply calculated every single one of his movements. That brat still probably hasn’t figured out that he would lose so terribly, right?”

“Haha. His hand will be crippled if he still carries on!” Zhang Ting and the other disciples smiled while looking at this scene.

Qin Tian also casually lowered his hand and coldly said, “All of your movements were within my calculations. From the moment you opened your eyes, you’ve already lost.”

On the other hand, the disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect were suffocating from Qin Tian’s aura. All of this looked as if it was within Qin Tian’s control as he played around with Lin Yun.

“You really know how to act, and I nearly believed it. I seem to only have lost a few strands of hair, right? Not even my skin is scratched,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Still being so tough after facing death. Senior Brother can tear you into pieces if he wants to.” Zhang Ting snickered.

“Is that so? Then let your Senior Brother give it a try…” Lin Yun said with a playful smile. Although it might seem that Zhang Ting held the advantage in the fight, Lin Yun was only curious about how the swords were created. Otherwise, Lin Yun could retaliate right from the first move.

But even so, it was all within his control and he didn’t feel any great pressure.

“You want to see some blood? As you wish…” Qin Tian’s eyes flashed with a ferocious light and he reached out with his right hand. As his right hand reached out, it began to change. He wanted to control the nine swords to teach Lin Yun a lesson. In the next second, the nine swords surrounding Lin Yun began to flicker.

But in the next moment, Qin Tian’s face froze because he realized that the nine swords couldn’t even tear apart Lin Yun’s skin, not to mention tearing Lin Yun apart. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Dragon runes began to appear on the surface of his body and the nine swords couldn’t leave any marks on his body. This made Qin Tian stupidly open his mouth. After all, he was confident about toying with an expert in the Lesser Elysium Core Realm if they were trapped by his nine swords, but he actually couldn’t do anything to Lin Yun!

“Looks like you failed.” Lin Yun smiled in disappointment, and his tone nearly made Qin Tian curse out.

“Let me show you blood, then.” Lin Yun smiled. The dragon runes on the surface of his body began to light up and the nine swords that were around him were sent flying away. When the swords fell onto the ground, they lost their luster and looked like ordinary swords.

At the same time, a vortex appeared in Lin Yun’s palm, like a huge beast that was devouring the sword in his hand. Not long later, only the sword hilt was left. When Lin Yun devoured the entire sword, this left Qin Tian completely dumbfounded with his jaw nearly falling off.

“I’ll give you a finger in return, then!” Before Qin Tian could recover from the shock, an iris flower appeared behind Lin Yun. When the sea of flowers overlapped, Lin Yun executed the Flicking Divine Finger.

This made Qin Tian squint his eyes and clasped his hands together to stop this attack. But the power behind this attack was too terrifying and quickly pierced through his right shoulder.

As blood splattered, Qin Tian was forced to take several steps back. Seeing that he couldn’t regain his stability, a painting slowly opened behind him and he used the power of his constellation to stabilize himself.

“Your constellation is impressive, indeed,” said Lin Yun.

Hearing those words, Qin Tian snorted, “I can also defeat you without using my constellation!”

As the painting disappeared, Qin Tian charged toward Lin Yun. But when he arrived before Lin Yun, he was quickly sent flying back by a slap from Lin Yun and his sword aura started to crumble. This immediately caused his cheek to swell as he rolled on the ground.

“You’re nothing without your constellation,” smiled Lin Yun.

This scene left the woman standing beside Ye Ziling to cover her mouth from the shock. Not only her, but everyone else from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was shocked by Lin Yun’s dominance.

At the same time, Jiang Lichen could feel his mouth go dry as he became excited. Lin Yun was right, even if he was weak, he wasn’t someone that just anyone could teach a lesson to!
