Chapter 1507 - Tian Jue (1)

The Dragon Burial Valley was an extremely dangerous place in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, but there was no doubt that there were a lot of treasures there comparable to the other sites in the astral realm. It was practically confirmed that Divine Dragon Bones could be found there.

Lin Yun’s motive in coming to the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm was to find a Divine Dragon Bone suitable for himself, which meant that he had to go to the Dragon Burial Valley no matter what. But did the seven demonic sects really find a way to deal with the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses?

“Now that the trial has been canceled, is there a need for us to travel with the envoys?” Xiao Yun asked, looking at An Liuyan. He had no interest in the other envoys, and this summoning order made him feel like they were servants. Xiao Yun naturally didn’t have a good temper and only worked with An Liuyan. So he did not need to listen to the orders of the first envoy.

“Before entering the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, the elders instructed us that the first envoy will be the leader amongst us, and we’re not allowed to fight amongst ourselves. You can ignore him if you don’t plan on entering the Dragon Burial Valley.” An Liuyan replied.

“This is troublesome, then.” Xiao Yun rubbed his forehead, and it looked like he had no choice but to heed the summons.

“How are the seven demonic sects planning to deal with the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses?” Lin Yun was more curious about this. He had personally fought with Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, and he knew those weren’t easy to deal with.

“Nothing exact, he only said that those who cultivated a body-refining technique could deal with those Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses. The first envoy says we can ignore the other guests but must bring along those who cultivate a body-refining technique.” An Liuyan’s eyes flashed with doubt as she looked at Lin Yun.

After all, Lin Yun didn’t have any advantage against those Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses even though he had practiced a Dragon Clan’s body-refining technique.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“You can deal with those Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses?” Xiao Yun was surprised as he looked at Lin Yun.

“I can’t.” Lin Yun replied with a weird expression. When he fought with those Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, he didn’t feel that the body-refining technique could deal with them, and the dragon runes were useless against them.

The Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses were tough to deal with because they had transparent bodies. Or rather, they were nearly invincible aside from their eyes. Lin Yun had to resort to the Aurora Dragon Pupils and Qiongqi’s Strength to deal with them, which had nothing to do with his body-refining technique.

“What the hell, then?” Xiao Yun muttered.

“We’ll know when we’re there.” Lin Yun replied.

An Liuyan took out a jade slip and placed it against her forehead. In the next second, light beams flew out from the jade slip. Not long later, Elder Chen, Can Jiu, and Ding Lei rushed over.

Elder Chen was the fastest because he wasn’t far from An Liuyan, which meant he could rush over anytime. Can Jiu and Ding Lei appeared together, and they were occasionally emitting a holy light from their bodies. They were stronger than when they initially entered the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.

This meant they had a huge harvest in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, especially Ding Lei, who gave off boundless vitality. Only Chen Yan was nowhere to be seen, which probably meant that he had died somewhere in the astral realm.

This wasn’t surprising because many people have died in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm by far. So it was expected that at least one person would die amongst their group of six.

An Liuyan briefly explained what was happening before they rushed towards the Dragon Burial Valley.

The gathering location of the thirteen envoys was on a mountain at the edge of the Dragon Burial Valley, and this mountain was called the Dragon Seeking Mountain. It wasn’t a majestic mountain, but looking from the front, one would see a tattered and desolate valley.

The valley's entrance was a flight of stairs covered in blood and littered with corpse remains. When the seven demonic sects launched multiple attacks on the valley, they had suffered lots of casualties.

All of the envoys, aside from An Liuyan, have gathered on the Dragon Seeking Mountain, and the envoys had several geniuses behind them. They all shared something in common, they were all body-refining cultivators.

All geniuses have cultivated their body for some part of their life. After all, it was unwise for geniuses of their level to have a huge weakness, it’s just that they weren’t as good as those who specialized in refining their physiques. Even Lin Yun’s physique couldn’t be compared to Ding Lei, who had the bloodline of the Demon Clan.

Lin Yun’s gaze focused mainly on the envoys, observing their strength. The Heavenly Astral Pavilion’s foundation was a little lacking, and most of the envoys couldn’t fight Xie Feng, based on the strength and cultivation they had revealed thus far. On the other hand, Xie Feng was ranked sixth in the Netherworld Hall, meaning there were five ahead of him.

“These people don’t seem to know how body-refining cultivators can deal with those Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses.” Lin Yun glanced at the body-refining cultivators the envoys had brought over and noticed that they weren’t discussing this at all. This was because most of them had suspicion on their faces.

“Let’s wait for the first envoy. He has the strongest obsession on the Dragon Burial Valley amongst the thirteen envoys.” An Liuyan said.

“The first envoy?” Lin Yun asked.

When An Liuyan looked at a youth donned in golden clothes, she replied, “The first envoy’s name is Tian Jiu. He’s the strongest amongst the thirteen envoys, and only he can compete with the six demonic sects’ chief disciples amongst the top five envoys. Simultaneously, he’s also the oldest amongst us.”

He can compete with the chief disciples of the other six demonic sects? Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that. He had no idea how strong the other six demonic sects’ chief disciples were, but there was no doubt that they were much stronger than Xie Feng.

Lin Yun couldn’t even fight Xie Feng without using his trump cards before consuming the Demon-Refining Fruit, especially at his cultivation level. He was practically being one-sidedly suppressed in his fight with Xie Feng and barely resisted relying on his firmament sword intent.

“Aside from Tian Jue, you must be careful of the envoys in the top five. They all have terrifying strengths, and none are weaker than Xie Feng. Some of them might even be stronger than Xie Feng.” An Liuyan transmitted her voice to Lin Yun.

Just when An Liuyan introduced the envoys ranked in the top five to Lin Yun, the first envoy Tian Jue finally spoke up. “All the body-refining cultivators step forth and let me take a look at you guys!”

His voice echoed like an ancient bell, making everyone’s eardrums tremble.

The guests behind the thirteen envoys didn’t hesitate to step forth, and this was the same for Ding Lei, who An Liuyan invited. Ding Lei had a massive harvest in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. He could tell that Tian Jue was strong and wanted to receive the latter’s acknowledgment.
