Chapter 2334 - Powerful Lin Yun

This scene shocked everyone with disbelief as they looked at Lin Yun. Everyone had a rough impression of Lin Yun but soon laughed in disdain when everyone recognized Lin Yun, who had been walking around earlier.

“Is Xin Wuhen insane? That fellow is just a laughingstock and has been wandering around earlier. So how can he possibly obtain a Golden Dao Fruit?”

“If he obtained a Golden Dao Fruit, why doesn’t he have any expression on his face? If I had obtained a Golden Dao Fruit, I wouldn’t be able to hold back.”

“How can that person possibly obtain a Golden Dao Fruit?” Discussions resounded from the surroundings since everyone was surprised by what Xin Wuhen said.

But hearing about the Golden Dao Fruit, Wang Jue raised his brow and looked at Xin Wuhen, frowning. Ghost Owl also turned to look at Xin Wuhen, causing the latter to stammer, “I only saw a glimpse of a golden ray in his hand. So you should let him take out his dao fruits, and we’ll know the answer then.”

Ghost Owl rolled her eyes because that was truly the case. She just had to make Lin Yun take them out to see if they were real, so she looked at Lin Yun with ripples in her heart. She didn’t notice it earlier, but Lin Yun was pretty dashing. She smiled, “You’re quite handsome. Behave and take out your dao fruits to let me see them.”

Her smile was charming, but everyone only felt a chill down their spines after recalling how brutal she was earlier.

“Forget it. I’ll help myself to it.” Ghost Owl didn’t wait for Lin Yun’s response and made her move with the nine ghostly flames revolving behind her.

Everyone immediately felt a chill down their spines, making their souls shiver. Many people were caught off guard and threw out blood, with their faces turning pale and their vitality diminishing.

“Demoness! She’s a demoness!” Everyone’s faces became pale as they retreated.

Xiong Tiannan frowned with surprise flashing through his eyes because Ghost Owl was too fast. Not only Xiong Tiannan but Lin Jiangxian didn’t react in time earlier because the thought of Lin Yun possessing Golden Dao Fruits never crossed her mind.

In a split second, Ghost Owl pushed back dozens of people with the aura she gave off, with the nine ghostly flames blooming like flowers, exuding a deadly aura.

“Death Touch!” Ghost Owl waved her hand and the ghostly figure manifested into a demonic claw, lunging at Lin Yun. Everything happened too fast, and everyone could already foresee that Lin Yun would be torn apart. After all, this was the attack that Ghost Owl used to defeat Bai Yu earlier.

But in the critical moment, Lin Yun used his fingers as a sword, and his aura changed when he raised his head, giving off a sharp aura that made him look like a sword immortal. When he stabbed his fingers at the claw, light shone from his fingers and all the swordsmen on Qilin Mountain trembled and could feel that they were losing control of their swords.

When the light spread out, Lin Yun’s eyes became golden as he released his Divine Light Sword Intent. A powerful sword aura swept out, catching many people in the surroundings by surprise, and they were sent flying away. When his sword intent bloomed, a sword ray flew out with a shake of his wrist, releasing a dazzling radiance that made the entire Qilin Mountian dim.

With a stab, Lin Yun’s fingers came in contact with the claw and Ghost Owl’s saint energy began to explode with the nine flames collapsing. But that wasn’t all. The sword ray unleashed from Lin Yun’s fingers made Ghost Owl’s fingers collapse like bamboo. This instantly left everyone from the Azure Cloud Realm dumbfounded.

When they looked at Lin Yun again, their eyes were filled with shock and disbelief. After all, Lin Yun had defeated Ghost Owl with one finger.

“This…” Xiong Tiannan and Lin Jiangxian were dumbfounded when they wanted to help Lin Yun. They couldn’t believe what they saw. Not only them but all the cultivators in the Azure Cloud Realm were filled with disbelief, including Ao Jue and Mu Xiuhan.

“H-How is this possible?” Chang Jun and Xi Ruo were also frightened after seeing Lin Yun defeat Ghost Owl with one move. Was this the same person who walked around the Sovereign Monument like a fool? This was the reincarnation of a sword immortal!

“Who the hell is this person?”

“I don’t know, but I hear others calling him Lin Yun.”

“Didn’t they say he’s a joke wandering around the Sovereign Monument?” When everyone from the Azure Cloud Realm recovered from their shock, discussions erupted amongst them.

“Big Brother Lin is the best!” Ji Zixi’s face was excitedly red, and she didn’t bother hiding her pride. This was the Lin Yun she knew, Flower Burial, who was invincible in the Kunlun Realm. Even in the Heavenly Barren Realm, he was the best. She had always been confident in Lin Yun without a hint of hesitation.

A commotion broke out on Qilin Mountain as everyone became excited. Since Lin Yun was so strong, wouldn’t that mean everyone could keep their dao fruits?

Wang Jue was surprised while Thunderhawk, Ray Serpent, and Heavenly Wood’s faces changed. Thunderhawk moved the fastest and grabbed onto Ghost Owl. When he lowered his head, he discovered that Ghost Owl had long fainted from the pain.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Fourth Sister!” Thunderhawk’s face was terrifyingly dark as he discovered that Ghost Owl was bleeding profusely from her wounds. With Ghost Owl’s physique, she should’ve recovered from her injuries long ago and would be able to grow a new arm soon. But she was bleeding profusely from her wounds with no signs of healing.

“I’ll kill you!” Thunderhawk was infuriated and pushed his palm forth without any hesitation. After lightning gathered in his palm, it formed into an ancient divine rune that descended towards Lin Yun.

Before the palm descended, a terrifying aura tore apart the surrounding space, creating fine cracks that sealed off the space around Lin Yun. This attack was fast and ruthless, not to mention that it sealed Lin Yun’s path of retreat, wanting to kill Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun was even faster. Hundreds of ribbons suddenly flew out, and the surrounding lightning was shattered. When the lightning dissipated, it manifested into scattering flames, leaving holes in the ground with magma surging.

When everyone saw this, their faces changed. If a sixth-stage Saint Lord came in contact with this flame, they would be incinerated into ashes. With just this alone, anyone could tell how powerful Thunderhawk was.

“What powerful Divine Light Sword Intent!” Thunderhawk sensed Lin Yun’s sword intent and finally knew how he could defeat Ghost Owl so quickly. That was the Divine Light Sword Intent at complete mastery.

“No wonder Fourth Sister was defeated so quickly. Just your sword intent alone, you’re qualified to ascend the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain. But you’re unfortunate to run into me!” Thunderhawk no longer held back and his golden pill began to ignite with an ancient bloodline being awakened, releasing a roar.

With him in the center, the entire Qilin Mountain began to tremble violently as everyone sensed a powerful and ancient aura being released by Thunderhawk. In the next second, a golden radiance exploded from Thunderhawk as a pair of golden wings appeared behind him.

“Golden Winged Roc!”

“Are all of the Azure Divine Guards that powerful? I’m afraid they all possess a primordial demonic beast’s bloodline.”

“With his cultivation and the Golden Winged Roc’s bloodline, he’s practically invincible amongst sixth-stage Saint Lords.”

The Golden Winged Roc was an ancient primordial beast that was even more powerful than the Emerald Demonic Ape, possessing the ancient bloodline of fiendgods. Thunderhawk’s hands became sharp with scales appearing.

Lin Yun examined the Golden Winged Roc’s hands curiously with a playful expression.

“You’re courting death!” Thunderhawk felt provoked, and he reached out for Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun merely thrusted his fingers forth like a sword. When the two powers collided, Thunderhawk was forced to take ten-odd steps back before stabilizing himself, while Lin Yun didn’t take a step back and looked calm.

“I’m afraid you’re not qualified to have me draw my sword if this is the best you can do,” Lin Yun smiled.

“How dare you!” Thunderhawk became furious as his body swelled up, releasing a divine aura with a Golden Winged Roc’s roar echoing from within his body.

“Golden Winged Divine Physique!” Everyone exclaimed as they recognized the divine physique that Thunderhawk possessed. With the Golden Winged Divine Physique, in addition to the Golden Winged Roc’s bloodline, it was no wonder that he dared to be so arrogant.

After Thunderhawk exchanged ten-odd moves with Lin Yun, he discovered he couldn’t suppress his opponent. Lin Yun stood firmly on the ground with his vitality like a huge river, providing endless power to him.

“What’s going on?” Thunderhawk looked at Lin Yun with horror. He exclaimed, “How is this possible? I even brought out my divine physique, so how can a mere fifth-stage Saint Lord like you possibly withstand my attacks?”

Lin Yun winked, and smiled, “Who doesn’t have a divine physique these days? You think that you’re the only one with a divine physique?”

When Lin Yun said that, a dragon’s roar echoed from his body and the Azure Dragon Divine Rune began to shine. When a radiance shone from his body, a dragon’s roar and aura spread, creating a shocking scene. As Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind, the Dragon’s Blood in his body began to boil. When he threw his punch, the Azure Dragon Divine Rune gathered on his fist, manifesting into a dragon’s head, with his arm being the dragon’s torso.

The punch quickly sent Thunderhawk flying away, and his golden wings began to flap with golden feathers raining down on Lin Yun. But they only caused sparks to fly, and those feathers were bounced back. This left everyone dumbfounded, since they had never seen such a battle before.
