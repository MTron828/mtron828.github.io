Chapter 1855 - Curtain Falls

They were a few hundred miles away a moment ago and had already descended from the sky the next moment. Six Quasi-Saints represented the six holy lands. They immediately rushed over from Heavenly Domain City when they got the news. But because of the distance, it would take a long time for them to get here without a saint-class warship, even if they were Quasi-Saints.

As for why no Saints descended, it was simply that the six holy lands had a branch each in the Heavenly Domain City, and most branches only had a Saint. After all, Heavenly Domain City was only a small part of the Eastern Desolation, and there were at least ten other similar cities in the Eastern Desolation.

Even the holy lands had a limited number of Saints, and it was already terrifying that they could dispatch a Saint to be stationed in those cities. This was something that the Sword Sect couldn’t accomplish but those Saints couldn’t leave so easily. If they had to dispatch a Saint, they would have to dispatch one directly from their holy lands, and the distance was an issue. So unless it was a Great Saint, it wouldn’t be easy for them to arrive so quickly.

The arrival of the six Quasi-Saints made the surrounding atmosphere subtle, and the Ming Cult’s disciples looked excited.

“They’re really fast.” Lin Yun muttered. That black-clothed Quasi-Saint from the Blood Moon Sect probably sensed them, so he left so quickly.

“Lin Xiao, what should we do now?” Mei Zihua asked. He was nervous and excited.

“Wait. I’m not confident about the Ming Cult, but the other holy lands won’t be so shameless.” Gu Jun smiled with his eyes squinted while stroking his beard.

When Lin Yun turned to look in the Ming Cult’s direction, he noticed the yellow-robed Quasi-Saint looking at him coldly while Huang Xuanyi whispered in his ears. When Quasi-Saint looked at him, his face became even darker.

“It looks like we won’t be able to resolve this matter so easily. Old man, are you confident in dealing with that yellow-robed Quasi-Saint?” Lin Yun asked.

“Fifty percent.” Gu Jun wasn’t fully confident because he had just become a Quasi-Saint and wasn’t a Quasi-Saint proficient in martial dao.

“Young Master, I know him. He’s the Altar Lord of the Ming Cult in Heavenly Domain City, known as Quasi-Saint Chang Feng. His cultivation is at the third stage of the Quasi-Saint Realm.” An Liuyan whispered beside Lin Yun.

Lin Yun fell into deep thought when he heard that. These people better know when to stop, or he wouldn’t hold back any longer. He even killed a Saint, and he could kill a Quasi-Saint if he gave it his all.

No one noticed that Lin Yun’s pupils were brewing with killing intent. If anyone knew that Lin Yun even dared to kill a Quasi-Saint, they would surely be shocked.

“Yuanqi.”

“Lingfeng.”

“Qingyang.”

……

““Disciple is here!””

When the six Quasi-Saints arrived, they called out their sects’ disciples and understood what happened here. The Quasi-Saint from the Heavenly Dao Sect was a grey-robed elder named Jiang Yang. When he heard what Xiao Yuanqi said, he involuntarily turned to look at Lin Yun.

“He’s Lin Xiao?” Jiang Yang asked, stroking his beard.

“Yeah. He’s the one who killed the Fire God General while Gu Jun of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion chased the Blood Moon Sect’s Quasi-Saint away. Otherwise, the consequences would’ve been dire…” Xiao Yuanqi said truthfully. After all, the black-clothed Quasi-Saint killed a pinnacle Nirvana Stage from the Heavenly Flame Sect before Lin Yun’s party came out, and they would’ve died if the Blood Moon Sect wanted to kill them.

“The Blood Moon Sect is becoming more rampant over the years.” Jiang Yang furrowed his brows with a hint of concern in his pupils. The Blood Moon Sect had been becoming increasingly high profile recently, and the holy lands’ higher hierarchy naturally sensed it. They had a feeling that the peace in the Kunlun Realm would soon change.

“Speaking of which, that little fellow has been rising really quickly. Given time, he’ll definitely become an influential figure.” Jiang Yang looked at Lin Yun with admiration in his pupils. After all, that was the tenth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. To achieve it, one needed not only high aptitude but also luck. There was no doubt that Lin Yun would be a saint in the future.

When the golden age comes, Lin Yun might even be able to reach the peak of the Kunlun Realm. The other holy lands’ Quasi-Saints, also looked at Lin Yun with admiration. If the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown was really in the hands of Gu Jun, a Quasi-Saint, it was no longer a matter they could take into their hands, and they could only wait for the Saint of their sects to decide. Not to mention it obviously wasn’t appropriate to take action now.

Without mentioning that Lin Yun’s party saved them; just the fact that Gu Jun was a Quasi-Saint means he’s no longer someone they could handle. After all, they might not be able to catch up if Gu Jun was determined to run. If that happened, there would be no room for maneuvering in the future unless they didn’t want to have any interaction with the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion in the future.

“You’re Lin Xiao?” Right then, a cold bark resounded that captured everyone’s attention. The Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint walked over with a group of people, releasing his Quasi-Saint aura at the same time. Anyone could tell that this Quasi-Saint meant trouble.

But his aura as a Quasi-Saint was soon blocked by Gu Jun’s aura. At the same time, An Liuyan and Mei Zihua also didn’t hesitate to stand beside Lin Yun.

“That’s me.” Lin Yun looked at the Quasi-Saint and asked, “What advice does Quasi-Saint Chang Feng have for me?”

The yellow-robed Quasi-Saint was briefly stunned when his name was called out, and he said, “I have no advice for you. I would like to ask you two questions. Did you kill Yu Wenxiu?”

“I did.” Lin Yun replied.

“Do you regret it?” Quasi-Saint Chang Feng coldly looked at Lin Yun, gritting his teeth.

“He’s stubborn, so he deserved it.” Lin Yun replied. His strong response startled everyone, and the faces of those from the Ming Cult were ugly. After all, Lin Yun had no intention of even apologizing to them.

“Altar Lord, why bother wasting time with him? Just capture him!” Huang Xuanyi yelled.

With a gloomy expression, Quasi-Saint Chang Feng said, “I’ll seal your cultivation and bring you back to the Ming Cult for punishment. If you’re really from the Azure Dragon’s lineage, get the seniors of your clan to collect you from the Ming Cult. Let’s see if you still dare to be so stubborn at that time.”

Everyone’s hearts sank because the Ming Cult clearly had no intention of letting this matter rest despite knowing that Gu Jun was a Quasi-Saint.

But Lin Yun merely raised his head and looked at the Quasi-Saint with a playful gaze, “You can’t stop me from leaving. You can give it a try if you want.”

“I can’t stop you from leaving? You’re overthinking it!” Quasi-Saint Chang Feng sneered.

When he finished, he reached out to Lin Yun, and Lin Yun had no intentions of taking a step back. On the other hand, Gu Jun was prepared and pushed his palm forth, facing Quasi-Saint Chang Feng’s attack.

A majestic aura swept out when the two saints clashed. An Liuyan and Mei Zihua both retreated ten-odd meters away before resolving the clash's shockwave. On the other hand, everyone from the Ming Cult was blown away, and not even those at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage could withstand the shockwave.

When the shockwave slowly died down, Gu Jun and Quasi-Saint Chang Feng were revealed in a deadlock with their palms. This surprised Quasi-Saint Chang Feng because Gu Jun was a musician, according to his information, and he had just recently reached the Quasi-Saint Realm. But when they clashed, the saint aura within Gu Jun’s body far exceeded his imagination.

Just when he was feeling uneasy, a figure dashed over. It turned out that there was someone who didn’t retreat from the shockwave created by the two Quasi-Saints. It was naturally Lin Yun who resisted the shockwave head-on, relying on his two saint physiques. The shockwave was something that even those at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage couldn’t withstand, but it wasn’t that terrifying to Lin Yun.

Azure Dragon Grasp!

Lin Yun dashed forth like a sharp sword and disappeared. When he reappeared, his palm was already on Quasi-Saint Chang Feng’s chest. Activating his Azure Dragon Intent at the sixth grade, lightning began to rumble into the sky like an ancient Azure Dragon wandering in the clouds.

Shortly after, a gigantic dragon claw descended from the sky, instantly empowering him. This caught Quasi-Saint Chang Feng by surprise, before throwing out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying away. He was engaged in a deadlock with Gu Jun, but then suddenly took an attack that immediately caught him off guard and left him heavily injured.

“Altar Lord!” Everyone from the Ming Cult panicked, and they hurried over to Quasi-Saint Chang Feng, furiously looking at Lin Yun.

“Lin Xiao, how dare you launch a sneaked attack on me!” Quasi-Saint Chang Feng was furious. He was a dignified Quasi-Saint, and it was a humiliation for him to suffer in the hands of a junior, not to mention when there were other Quasi-Saints around here.

“Oh?” Lin Yun wore a mockery expression and replied, “I’m surprised you know what ‘shame’ is. After all, a Quasi-Saint like you wanted to make a move on a junior like me. Do you know about shame, then?”

“Well said!” The Quasi-Saint of the Divine Phoenix Mountain smiled. “Quasi-Saint Chang Feng, your sect’s junior, died in the hands of Lin Xiao because he was weak. So why are you trying to bully a junior? You’re just embarrassing the Ming Cult. Also, don’t even think that you can take Lin Xiao away today. Lin Xiao isn’t only the champion of the Nirvana Banquet and first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. He’s also the fiancé of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s Profound Fairy and the junior brother of Elder Mu Xueling. I’ll be honest with you; my Divine Phoenix Mountain also owes him a great favor.”

Quasi-Saint Chang Feng’s face became pale because those titles made him feel suffocating.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Right then, the Heavenly Dao Sect’s Quasi-Saint, Jiang Yang, spoke out, “Quasi-Saint Chang Feng, can you not tell that his attack earlier was a secret technique of the Azure Dragon’s lineage? Otherwise, why do you think you fell for it? Can someone without any Azure Dragon lineage status learn such a secret technique? Let’s not mention that a Quasi-Saint’s disciple died; your Ming Cult can only suck it up even if a Saint’s disciple died!”

The two Quasi-Saints were warning Quasi-Saint Chang Feng to face reality. At the very least, Lin Xiao wasn’t someone a Quasi-Saint like him could touch. With that, the faces of everyone from the Ming Cult were ugly.

“I’m grateful that two Seniors stood out for me.” Lin Yun cupped his hands and glanced at Quasi-Saint Chang Feng before he left with his party.

“Young lad, please hold on. The journey might not be saved. So let me send you off.” The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Quasi-Saint stepped forth with a smile.

“Let’s go together. The Heavenly Dao Sect will also send you off.” Jiang Yang smiled and led the Heavenly Dao Sect’s party over. The other Quasi-Saints also came to their senses and came forth with a smile on their faces. After all, there was no question that Lin Yun would surely rise in the future, and it was best to befriend him now than to become his enemy.

Not to mention the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown was on Gu Jun, and they had to make a trip to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion with him. The holy lands had to discuss what to do with a supreme treasure like that.

Very quickly, the Ming Cult was the only one left behind, and they were greatly humiliated today. But there was nothing they could do about it. This made the demonic cultivators nearby dumbfounded because they didn’t expect it to end in this manner.

“Unbelievable, five of the holy lands are escorting Lin Xiao together!”

“First on the Dragon Pulse Ranking; he’s really popular.”

“Yeah. Who can imagine that the holy lands still had some resentment for Lin Xiao earlier; they’re all so respectful now.”

“After today, Lin Xiao’s name will be even more resounding. But the Ming Cult has really become a laughingstock this time.” Everyone discussed it amongst themselves. Then again, it wasn’t too surprising if they really thought about it. This was a world where only the strong were respected, and Lin Xiao used his strength to win the respect of the five holy lands. Even if the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown wasn’t on him, no one would become his enemy if they weren’t fools.

One had to admit that Gu Jun was shrewd in resolving Lin Yun’s crisis so easily. Then again, the more important thing was how Lin Yun killed the Fire God General and how decisive he was when he attacked Quasi-Saint Chang Feng earlier.
