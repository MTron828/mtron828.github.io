Chapter 2084: Wishing To Be Drunk

Under the chaotic battlefield, Lin Yun held the Flower Burial Sword and charged in Zhao Wuji’s direction. He gave off a powerful aura with his hair fluttering in the wind, allowing his murderous intent to wreak havoc without concealing it.

“You want to kill me? Haha, you must be courting death!” Zhao Wuji sneered. He wasn’t panicking because his bodyguard wasn’t just the Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saint beside him. He was cocky, and naturally offended many people in the dark. Someone like him cherished his life the most, and he would never put himself in a dangerous position.

Lin Yun went on a rampage as he charged forth, killing deacons and disciples of the Black Plume Palace with an attack. No one beneath the Quasi-Saint Realm could withstand an attack from him. In such a short time, Lin Yun had already taken twenty lives, and no one dared to stand in his path anymore.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to be a hundred meters away from Zhao Wuji as a mountain of corpses appeared behind him. But Zhao Wuji didn’t look worried as he allowed Lin Yun’s murderous intent to blow over.

Four masked figures dashed over before Lin Yun could take a step forth. They were Zhao Wuji’s soldiers, all at the Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saint. They were stronger than Black Plume Palace’s elders because they weren’t afraid. If Zhao Wuji gave the order, they would even face a Saint head-on without hesitation.

As four constellations unfolded behind them, ancient black serpents flew out from their constellations as they unsheathed a black shortsword each. They were enveloped in indigo demonic flames and were emotionless killing machines with indifference in their eyes.

The corner of Zhao Wuji’s lips curled into a sneer. He had high hopes for the four because the four would even self-destruct in critical moments to ensure his order was fulfilled.

This was unimaginable because the self-destruct of a Quasi-Saint was enough to heavily injure Ye Qingtian. If the four simultaneously self-destruct, Ye Qingtian would die even if he was a peerless genius. Aside from that, the four also possessed their ultimate moves and put their lives on the line to fulfill the order given to them. So the four were born to kill.

The battlefield was chaotic. This was a rare battle between Quasi-Saints. The environment had changed within a thousand miles, with various phenomena appearing, and the earth-shattering battle left the spectators shocked.

Zhao Wuji maintained his composure, letting the strong wind blow over his hair, revealing a stern expression. Looking at the battlefield, Zhao Wuji sneered and took out a wine cup from his sleeve with a provocative gaze. Seeing this, a sword servant immediately poured wine for him.

“You want to fight me? Killing you is as easy as butchering a dog!” Zhao Wuji gulped down the wine and didn’t bother concealing his voice. He said that on purpose to let Ye Qingtian hear it. He was fearless and cocky with confidence for the four soldiers.

The four soldiers were strong, and Lin Yun could sense an unusual aura from them. When ancient seals bloomed within the four soldiers’ eyes, a horrifying murderous intent swept out.

Seeing this, the cold smirk on Zhao Wuji’s lips grew even denser. As both sides clashed, four heads flew out with a dazzling sword ray. That sword ray looked like the first ray of light when the world was born.

Slaying four Quasi-Saints with one sword, Lin Yun didn’t even bother stopping his footstep.

“Light of the Beginning!” Gu Zijing and Jiang Yunting felt their scalps tingling. They had long heard that Ye Qingtian used this sword technique to kill a Quasi-Saint in Six Holy City. They were still filled with regret that they couldn’t see it during the Sword Assembly. But after witnessing it now, they finally knew why Ye Qingtian didn’t use it in his fight with Feng Shaoyu.

They finally realized that Ye Qingtian wasn’t boasting when he said he didn’t want to kill Feng Shaoyu and could easily defeat Feng Shaoyu.

“Light of the Beginning!” Zhao Wuji’s face became pale, his hand trembling. His lips began to twitch because the rumors were true, and Ye Qingtian really had such a sword technique.

“Young Lord, you leave first. I’ll stop him!” The face of the Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saint changed.

“I’m not leaving. Will I be afraid of him? Tian Yuan, kill him! I want the sword on his back!” Zhao Wuji’s face was dark, and he was stubborn. He called the name of the Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saint and gritted his teeth.

Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan looked helpless, but he didn’t have the time to think because Lin Yun had already charged over. He swayed his body as saint dao enveloped him with his indigo saint aura gushing out. When he hovered in the air, the saint dao manifested into an indigo flower that made him look like a saint.

He was also a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase but was much stronger than Feng Shaoyu.

“Bring the table and wine! I want to see how his head falls today!” Zhao Wuji roared. His three sword servants didn’t dare to delay and quickly carried a table and a gorgeous chair.

Zhao Wuji leaned on the chair as the three servants trembled in fear. The three sword servants didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to be so strong and, deep in their hearts, didn’t want to stay here. But since Zhao Wuji insisted on staying, they didn’t dare to run.

“Wine!” Zhao Wuji didn’t care as he watched the battle between Lin Yun and Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan.

“As expected of a genius swordsman. It’s a pity to kill you, but you have to die no matter what. So I’m sorry!” Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan drew a saint sword and poured his saint dao into it. When he thrusted the sword, the surrounding air exploded with a sword ray dashing forth.

This was an ingenious attack. It wasn’t a sword technique, but it was stronger than various sword techniques that were executed by those at the Nirvana Stage. Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan was smart and didn’t want to resort to fancy moves with Ye Qingtian. His attack focused on being ruthless.

“Good!” Zhao Wuji laughed as he picked up the cup on the table.

Lin Yun activated the two glory spirits on the Flower Burial Sword and raised his sword to block the incoming attack. The two looked like they passed by one another, before Lin Yun was sent flying away. He even failed to maintain a grip on his sword.

But Lin Yun spun mid-air and landed on Zhao Wuji’s table, grabbing the wine cup in front of Zhao Wuji and gulping it down. On the other hand, Zhao Wuji was dumbfounded as he began to wonder if his eyes were messing with him.

“Young Lord!” Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan’s face changed. He finally realized it wasn’t that Ye Qingtian couldn’t block his sword but that he had other objectives. Knowing he was fooled, Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan was anxious and wanted to rush over to save Zhao Wuji.

But Lin Yun’s sword flew back, as if someone held it when he moved. As the two glory spirits shone, the sword held Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan down with a brilliant sword technique. The sword was naturally the Flower Burial Sword.

“Excellent wine! It’s actually the Millennium Flame. It has been a long time since I’ve drunk this wine.” Lin Yun toyed with the wine cup and smiled at Zhao Wuji.

The three sword servants behind Zhao Wuji were scared out of their wits. They turned around and wanted to run, but Lin Yun used his fingers as a sword and executed three swords, each striking the sword servants’ foreheads.

The three sword servants had a hole in their foreheads before they could even turn around. When they collapsed on the ground, Zhao Wuji finally came to his senses and sat upright on his chair, not daring to make a move. His face was pale as he tightened his grip on the armrest.

He couldn't beg for mercy because that didn’t exist in his dictionary. So Zhao Wuji might as well go all out. He coldly said, “Kill me if you dare and see if the eleven holy lands here will let you go.”

But Lin Yun simply ignored Zhao Wuji. He held onto the cup with his right hand and threw a punch forth. He had infused the power of the dual sword stars into this punch, blowing Zhao Wuji and the chair he sat on into smithereens, without a trace of him being left behind.

Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan was stumped because he didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to be so cocky. He was stumped by the fact that Zhao Wuji was killed, and he yelled, “Young Lord!”

He couldn’t figure out where Ye Qingtian got the guts to kill Zhao Wuji. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Ye Qingtian, you’re finished. You…” Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan wanted to reprimand Ye Qingtian, but a loud voice interrupted him.

“Old dog, come up and fight. If you can come out unscathed, consider it my loss!” Lin Yun summoned the Flower Burial Sword with a wave, pointing it at Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan as his other hand held the wine jar.

His courage shocked everyone, especially when Ye Qingtian challenged Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan before the Black Plume Palace could say anything about Zhao Wuji’s death. For a moment, everyone was stumped because they couldn’t believe that Zhao Wuji was dead.

Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan was briefly stunned. When he came to his senses, he roared, “You’re courting death!”

He had never suffered such humiliation before. Not only did Ye Qingtian not run after killing Zhao Wuji, but he even called him an old dog. No one could accept such an insult, not to mention he was a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase. So Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan dashed over without any hesitation.

“Come on!” Lin Yun gulped down the Millennium Flame and faced Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan head-on with the Flower Burial Sword. With that, a terrifying battle broke out on the small table.

Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan regretted it the moment he came to the table. He felt as though the sword in his hand was stuck, and he was flowing down a rapid current. He was completely trapped in the profundity of Ye Qingtian’s sword, and he couldn’t bring out his advantage as a Quasi-Saint.

“Not competing to be first!” Lin Yun laughed as his sword ray danced. In his hand, the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword had been completely transformed.

At this moment, it was as though Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng had possessed his body, possessing the grace of a Sword Emperor. It was as though the legend, Yu Qingfeng, had arrived. But this Yu Qingfeng was different because he had the arrogance of a young man.

“Good wine! Hahaha!” Lin Yun looked drunk as he contined to execute the Divine Firefly Sword. He stood his ground even when Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan wanted to forcibly break through with his saint dao. If Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan injured him, he would return the injuries tenfold!

Just like that, Lin Yun kept drinking the wine as he fought. Sword rays flashed around with blood splashing about. The two had become mad as they became covered in blood, and no one could tell who the blood belonged to.

In the end, Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan panicked because he felt that Ye Qingtian had gone insane to fight without concern for his life. Facing such a madman, Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan was scared and desperately wanted to leave the table.

“Hahaha! Don’t go. Take another sword from me!” Lin Yun laughed, unable to even firmly stand up, looking drunk. But the more drunk he looked, the more ruthless his attacks became. Even his eyes seemed to have turned crimson with blood.

Lin Yun was drunk, wanting to vent his emotions in this fight. No one could tell if the Divine Firefly Sword was controlling him or if he was executing them. Or if Yu Qingfeng really possessed his body at this point.

As Lin Yun executed the Divine Firefly Sword, the power of his sword kept increasing as though there was no limit. When he executed the last sword form, it was like a lightning bolt, and the battle finally paused. Lin Yun and Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan’s hair were dishevelled and covered in blood.

The only difference was that Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan’s complexion was pale, while Lin Yun’s eyes shone brightly as he held onto the wine jar and his sword. Lin Yun’s face was covered in blood as he grinned, “You lost.”

“You madman!” Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan gritted his teeth.

“I’ll die if I’m not mad. Get lost since you’ve lost!” Lin Yun laughed as he shook his wrist in his half-drunken state, unleashing a sword ray that sent Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan flying away.

When Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan left the table, his body crumbled apart as he blew into pieces.

“I won,” Lin Yun grinned, causing everyone who looked at him to take a deep breath.

But that wasn’t all. Everyone watched with disbelief as Lin Yun gulped down the Millennium Flame after killing Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan and sat with his hands on his knees. In the next second, a golden radiance rumbled as Lin Yun broke through the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage’s bottleneck, reaching the ninth transformation.
