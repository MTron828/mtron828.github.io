Chapter 1953 - Azure Dragon Sword Heart

Lin Yun rode on his sword under the moon. When he turned around, he could vaguely see the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf’s gaze from a thousand miles away. He knew that this matter wouldn’t be so easily resolved.

He wielded the sword scabbard with his left hand while he stepped on the Flower Burial Sword with his right foot. Along with a whooshing sound, Lin Yun dove into a forest. The Flower Burial Sword left his feet and returned to the scabbard as he firmly stood on the ground.

Lin Yun quickly examined his wounds and locked his brows together. He sighed, “It’s not easy to dispel the saint aura.”

All his injuries, including the bone cracks, internal organs, and dragon pulses, had recovered under the aid of the Blue Dragon Bone. But he was helpless with the saint aura left within his body.

Saint aura was transformed from nirvana aura, and the nirvana aura would transform into the saint aura after undergoing nine transformations. There was a huge gap between the two because the saint aura was more than ten times stronger than the nirvana aura. But the difference was even more unbelievable to a Quasi-Saint who cultivated a ghost spirit or dragon spirit cultivation technique.

This was because those at the Quasi-Saint already had one foot on the saint path.

Even if the Nirvana Stage was powerful, it was still under the scope of the mortal realm. The Nirvana Stage was the pinnacle of the mortal realm, but it was still the mortal realm. Not to mention Lin Yun wasn’t even at the Nirvana Stage.

This was why he paid close attention when fighting the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf and didn’t choose to clash head-on. He chose to fight from afar, relying on the Astral Sword Intent.

Even so, Lin Yun took several attacks, and nine surges of saint aura were left within his body. This was why Lin Yun left in a hurry after treating his injuries.

“Now that it’s cautious, it’ll be harder to kill it.” Lin Yun sat down and muttered, “But it also can’t kill me.”

His senior brother might be harsh, but his he wouldn’t watch him die. But it was inevitable for him to suffer, and he still had to ponder how to cultivate the Sword Heart in the Myriad Astral Celestial Art. Speaking of Sword Heart, he had already cultivated it, but not systematically.

“I should try and swiftly expel the saint aura.” Lin Yun closed his eyes and tried to expel the saint aura with his dragon origin, but his dragon origin was shattered before it even got close to the saint aura. He could only watch as the saint aura wreaked havoc within his body before healing his injuries with the Blue Dragon Bone, and he repeated this process multiple times.

But he could only do this because he possessed two saint physiques. If it was someone else in his position, they would’ve long died.

Left with no choice, Lin Yun could only use the Astral Sword Intent to expel the saint aura. His sword soul began to tremble, his Astral Sword Intent filled his body, and managed to stand a front against the saint aura.

As the two fell into a deadlock, neither one could do anything to the other. If he forcibly tried to clash, the saint aura would explode, and he would have several holes in his body. If he wasn’t careful, he would be blown apart.

“This is troublesome… Is this the power of the saint aura?” Lin Yun opened his eyes and muttered to himself. He wouldn't be so helpless if his cultivation was at the Nirvana Stage. After all, the difference between dragon origin and saint aura was too significant.

But even if his Astral Sword Intent was futile, it could temporarily trap the saint aura and stop it from wreaking havoc within his body. He closed his eyes and began to think about the Myriad Astral Celestial Art in his mind. “I have to hurry up.”

As he comprehended the Myriad Astral Celestial Art again, fine golden scriptures flew out of his body and covered him in scriptures, emitting a faint golden radiance. Lin Yun’s hands changed, and he recited the Myriad Astral Celestial Art mantra to mimic the Azure Dragon Sword Heart’s changes.

“Garbage! All of you are garbage! Catch him! Don’t let him go! I want him dead!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf roared with the rage of flames blazing in its pupils.

The roar of the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf echoed throughout the valley, making the wolf pack tremble in fear and leave the valley.

Blood was gushing out of its neck as the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf laid on the ground, which was a great humiliation. As a Quasi-Saint monarch demonic beast, it was actually wounded by a swordsman at the Profound Death Stage. Not to mention the nine holes on its head that were still bleeding.

The Astral Sword Intent left within its body was wreaking havoc, and even the massive saint aura could only temporarily suppress the sword intent. It was troublesome if it wanted to expel the sword intent completely.

But as long as it moved, the sword intent on its neck would start wreaking havoc. The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf could only watch as Lin Yun fled.

“Damn it! Cunning swordsman, I’ll find you no matter what!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf’s gaze was cold.

Four hours later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and saw multiple pairs of crimson gazes approaching him. Sensing the active seed within his body, Lin Yun shook his head and could only stop his cultivation of the Azure Dragon Sword Heart for now.

As long as the Blood Rune Fruit’s seed stayed within his body, he couldn’t break free from the demonic wolves’ pursuit.

Just when he wanted to leave, his gaze flickered, and a smile rose on his lips. Why did he have to leave?

Since he couldn’t avoid the wolf pack, why didn’t he use them to temper his Azure Dragon Sword Heart?

Thinking about it, Lin Yun calmly looked at the wolf pack. When the wolf pack pounced forth, Lin Yun circulated the Astral Sword Intent to suppress the saint aura within his body. But he knew he couldn’t kill the wolf pack by relying on his dragon origin because there were many demonic wolves in the late phase of the Nirvana Stage.

But he didn’t panic and watched the wolf pack pounce at him.

When the wolf pack stepped into the forest, Lin Yun activated the Azure Dragon Sword Heart once they were a thousand meters away from him. As his sword intent vibrated, his pupils began to shine like a pair of dragon pupils.

Lin Yun’s gaze was clear, and the demonic wolves pouncing at him were filled with flaws. With just a glance, he could notice the fatal spots of those demonic beasts.

After activating the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, a silver sword radiance appeared on the ground and swiftly spread to a hundred feet. This invisible sword aura sent the incoming demonic beasts flying away.

Lin Yun could easily manipulate thunderstorms within a hundred feet, and an unstable domain appeared that made Lin Yun look like a deity.

“This is the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, and I can even bear the pressure of a Quasi-Saint within a hundred feet.” Lin Yun looked at the demonic wolves charging over.

Fine cracks soon appeared on the sword radiance, and the radius soon shrunk to fifty feet, then ten feet. Under the impact, Lin Yun’s body was undergoing a huge impact, and his face became ugly.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

In the end, Lin Yun could only form a seal as the silver sword radiance slowly expanded and was further perfected.

“There’s a loophole here, and here as well… Since it’s the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, I naturally have to manipulate thunderstorms and possess the Azure Dragon Soul to be considered an entity…” Lin Yun was calm, enduring the impacts of those demonic beasts, and comprehended the profundity.

When the crude domain created by the Azure Dragon Sword Heart shattered, the Flower Burial Sword flew out, forcing all the demonic wolves to retreat. But Lin Yun had no changes on his face and clasped his hands together, before activating the Azure Dragon Sword Heart again.

As a silver sword radiance bloomed once more, it enveloped a hundred-foot radius once more with thunderstorms filling it. Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts, recalling the secret techniques in the Myriad Astral Celestial Art, and tapped his finger, “Since it’s the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, I naturally have to focus on the Azure Dragon!”

As starlight gushed and spread out from his finger, it soon filled the domain, and each starlight was his Astral Sword Intent, looking like an Azure Dragon coiling around Lin Yun.

It didn’t take long for the domain to be destroyed again because it wasn’t stable. But Lin Yun wasn’t disappointed and used the Flower Burial Sword to force the demonic wolves back before setting up the domain again.

Time gradually passed in this cycle. Two days passed in the blink of an eye, and Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Heart was further perfected. It became smoother for him to use, and it was more challenging for the demonic wolves to break it.

As Lin Yun’s eyes shone brightly, the complete skeleton of a dragon appeared within a hundred feet, and his eyes flashed with excitement, “I see! I can use starlight to forge the dragon skeleton and the dragon soul with thunderstorms!”

When Lin Yun’s hands moved, the thunderstorm stuck to the skeleton, and an azure dragon was slowly being formed within the domain. The azure dragon looked like a living saint sword, inflicting injuries on the demonic wolves that entered the domain.

As for those demonic wolves on the ground who were wailing out in pain, they were covered in sword wounds.

Far away, Ye Guhan couldn’t help sighing when he saw this scene, “Junior Brother is really a genius in the sword. This is the genuine Azure Dragon Sword Heart with a soul. That dog should be there soon, and the real test is finally coming.”

Ye Guhan chewed on a fruit in his hand, watching the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf, who recovered from its injuries, appear and approach Lin Yun’s location.
