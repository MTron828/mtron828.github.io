Chapter 583 - Profound Yin Water

Looking at the curiosity on Lin Yun’s face, Mo Ling smiled, “There’s a dangerous land in the Nether Prefecture called the Withernorth Sea that’s also connected to the Azure and Cloud Prefectures. You have heard of it before, right?”

Lin Yun didn’t waste his time purely cultivating in the academy. He also took some time to understand the entire Ancient Southern Domain. Therefore, he knew a thing or two about the Withernorth Sea. According to his knowledge, it wasn’t like your typical sea.

Rather than being a sea of water, it was a boundless desert. It was so vast that no one had ever come out of it alive after going in too deep. It was also said that the Withernorth Sea was a place where many sects were established in the ancient times and that it only became a barren desert due to a great battle.

Although the Withernorth Sea was a dangerous place to be, some ancient treasures were occasionally found by adventurers. So Lin Yun wouldn’t be surprised if something happened in the Withernorth Sea. He asked calmly, “Did someone find an ancient ruin, obtain an ancient treasure, or is a treasure appearing?”

“None of those,” smiled Mo Ling mysteriously.

“None? Then what is it?” Lin Yun’s curiosity was piqued by Mo Ling’s denial.

“Someone found an ancient tomb in the Withernorth Sea.”

“An ancient tomb?” There was no change to Lin Yun’s expression as he fell into deep thoughts. Since it was an ancient battlefield, it wasn’t surprising that a tomb would be found. After all, there might be an ancient tomb beneath any tattered tablet in the desert.

But those ancient tombs generally wouldn’t have any value as the owner of those tombs were usually small fries of a sect. But since Mo Ling said it was a big deal, then the owner of this tomb must have an extraordinary identity.

Mo Ling continued, “The owner of the tomb might be an Empyrean Realm powerhouse…”

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that as he asked, “Are you serious?”

“Heavenly Soul Realm experts were so rare in the Ancient Southern Domain that even a quasi-overlord force like the Heavenly Province Academy only had two to three of them. Although this was also due to the fact that the academy mainly researched spiritual runes instead of improving their martial cultivation, the other quasi-overlord forces also didn’t have many Heavenly Soul Realm experts.

Only overlord forces had more Heavenly Soul Realm experts. But even then, they only had a few more. Additionally, the Heavenly Soul Realm was divided into different stages.

So the Empyrean Realm that Mo Ling mentioned was above the Heavenly Soul Realm. Those existences were grand elders of the various sects in ancient times. They had reached a realm so lofty that not even the nine overlord forces could boast of having an Empyrean Realm expert. At best, they only had pinnacle Heavenly Soul Realms. Naturally, Lin Yun was shocked that the tomb might belong to an Empyrean Realm powerhouse.

An Empyrean Realm powerhouse was also called empyreans. As for their stages, Lin Yun didn’t really know anything about them.

“I was also shocked when I heard it,” said Mo Ling. “Ancient treasures have frequently appeared in the Withernorth Sea and there have also been many incomplete ancient cultivation techniques that have leaked out. As for ancient tombs, they’re even rarer. However, no one expected to find an Empyrean Realm powerhouse’s tomb. But looking at the way things are right now, it must be true. So much so that there might not only be one tomb, but a whole graveyard...” explained Mo Ling. She was very clearly shocked by the news.

“A whole graveyard belonging to empyreans?” Lin Yun took a deep breath as he muttered, “This is huge. No wonder you had someone wait for my return.”

“The news should be true. The overlord forces of the three nearby prefectures have sent people over, including the Heavenly Sword Sect. Lil’ Xue is currently attending to them right now,” said Mo Ling.

The Heavenly Sword Sect sent out their disciples? No wonder the academy was so empty. The Heavenly Sword Sect disciples naturally attracted everyone’s attention. After all, they were an overlord force.

“You can explore if you’re not in a hurry to leave. Following the Heavenly Sword Sect will be less dangerous. Who knows, you might even find the Profound Yin Water,” said Mo Ling seriously.

“Profound Yin Water? What’s that?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“It’s extremely rare and it can only be found in the overlord forces. Only disciples with monstrous talents will be rewarded with them. This is one of the reasons why the overlord forces’ geniuses are so powerful. Aside from their monstrous talent, the resources that they are exposed to play a large role in their strength,” said Mo Ling. “The Profound Yin Water is something every monstrous genius wants. They’re extremely precious as they can be refined in the Yin stage. However, they cannot be brought with spiritual jades.”

The Profound Yin Water was a precious resource that not very many overlord forces’ disciples knew about. The reason why Mo Ling knew about it was most likely related to her Mo Clan. The Mo Clan was an ancient clan in the Nether Prefecture and many of their descendants had joined overlord forces.

By itself, the Mo Clan alone was nothing. However, this would be a different story if they could blossom in the future. For instance, Mo Ling displayed her talent and would take control of the academy in the future. Fortunately, there were many descendants like her in the Mo Clan.

“There is a chance that the Profound Yin Water can be found in the tomb. So you might be able to obtain it if you go,” said Mo Ling. She believed that if there were Profound Yin Waters in the ancient tomb, Lin Yun would naturally be able to get a share with his strength.

The main prize in these kinds of ancient tombs are naturally the experts’ legacy, their treasures, and sometimes their corpses. However, the tomb will definitely attract experts on the Dragoncloud Ranking. It might not be easy for Lin Yun to fight for the legacies, but he could definitely get his hands on the Profound Yin Water.

Furthermore, with how Lin Yun’s strength far exceeded his cultivation, there was a high chance that he might catch everyone by surprise. So she didn’t wish for Lin Yun to miss this opportunity.

“I’ll give you my reply three days from now. Thanks for letting me know about it,” said Lin Yun.

He wouldn’t mind taking the risk if he didn’t comprehend the rose painting. But his harvest from the rose painting was good enough. He only needed to stabilize his foundation. At that time, it wouldn’t take long for him to reach the level of those geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

Additionally, it was a little risky for him to get involved with an intense competition when he had just comprehended the secrets from the rose painting. He was someone who would give it his all the moment he decided to do something. So if he really dipped his hands in the tomb’s affairs, how would he be satisfied with mere Profound Yin Water?

“I’ll get angry if you continue acting so politely,” laughed Mo Ling.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly and he cupped his hands before he left. When he left Mo Ling’s residence, he took a deep breath. “Withernorth Sea, empyreans’ tomb, and the Profound Yin Water…”

The Empyrean Realm was too far from him. Plus, he couldn’t even contend with Heavenly Soul Realm experts. Furthermore, if the tomb really belonged to an empyrean, it should have been found a long time ago. It was a little weird for it to only surface now.

Lin Yun wasn’t sure what sort of turbulence he would have to face, but he could be sure that the opponents he would be facing would at least be on Cao Zhen’s level. If not, then he would be facing the geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking. Cao Zhen might be strong, but he was still too tender compared to those on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

Before he returned, Lin Yun walked past the Infernal Plaza. This was a field where disciples would usually cultivate and engage in sparring. But today, this place was even busier than when the White Jade Academy sent their disciples over.

Lin Yun instantly guessed that someone was here. When outsiders came to the academy, they would usually have an ‘exchange’ and it seemed that the Heavenly Sword Sect wasn’t an exception. Lin Yun shook his head because he wasn’t interested. The Heavenly Province Academy’s foundation in martial techniques was rather weak, so as long as the Heavenly Sword Sect didn’t send out their weakest disciples, they should be able to fight with the academy’s core disciples or even defeat them.

“How powerful. Even Senior Brother Mei can’t last long.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Senior Brother Mei has defeated three people in a row, but the moment this youth made his move, the entire situation changed.”

“I’m afraid Senior Brother Mei won’t last long.”

Lin Yun was surprised when he heard that. He was surprised that Mei Ziyan was actually fighting. Mei Ziyan was an aloof person and Lin Yun even felt that he wasn’t any weaker than Mo Ling. So Lin Yun never expected that Mei Ziyan would be in such a pathetic state from a Heavenly Sword Sect’s disciple.

This piqued Lin Yun’s interest a little as he quietly walked towards the Infernal Plaza.
