Chapter 2395 - It Doesn’t Matter As Lin Yun Will Make A Move

Ye Wushuang was at the pinnacle of the Saint Lord. He was proficient in Wind Dao, which made him unrivalled in speed. He had already reached an unimaginable height in Wind Dao.

Ji Zixi was beautiful and gave off a noble air to those around her. If it was a normal setting, Ye Wushuang wouldn’t make a move against a woman, but it was a pity that they were at the Heavenly Barren Banquet.

Ye Wushuang said, “Sorry about this. I might have a higher cultivation and an older age, but this is the Heavenly Baren Banquet, and you’re the easiest opponent.”

He was frank and didn’t hide his intent. There was something else he didn’t say. The first battle would significantly boost his momentum if he won.

“No need to apologize. Let’s begin,” Ji Zixi said. The moment she finished speaking, she released dazzling flames as her constellation appeared. This was the first time she summoned her ancient constellation of the Phoenix lineage. When the painting unfolded, boundless Divine Phoenix Fire gushed out and formed a crown on her head. This was a Sovereign Constellation, the Phoenix King Crown!

When the Phoenix King Crown landed on Ji Zixi’s forehead, starlight shone, and a powerful aura swept out. Ye Wushuang stood the closest to Ji Zixi, and he could sense a terrifying heatwave that made him frown.

While Ji Zixi was still enveloped in saint radiance, phoenix fire swept out with her at the center.

“What power!”

“It’s a Sovereign Constellation! But that’s not surprising since she’s the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden.”

“Alas, she’s too young. If she had a few more years, she might grow to a formidable height.” Everyone knew Ye Wushuang picked a tough opponent for the first fight, and Ji Zixi wasn’t as weak as she looked.

“As expected.” Lin Yun smiled. He watched Ji Zixi grow to this point, and it really wasn’t easy.

Ye Wushuang felt danger as he released his constellation and pushed his cultivation to the limit, releasing his aura that was at the pinnacle of the Sword Lord. With a loud explosion, the power of wind burst forth and Ye Wushuang disappeared. Everyone knew that Ye Wushuang didn’t disappear but had pushed his speed to the limit.

As saint energy exploded on the stage, Ji Zixi and Ye Wushuang began to clash. Ji Zixi stood on the spot and could only defend since she couldn’t compete with Ye Wushuang in regards to speed. But that didn’t mean that she was utterly powerless against Ye Wushuang.

Ye Wushuang might be fast, but he would be significantly restricted if he entered a hundred foot-radius of the Phoenix King Crown, and they exchanged a few hundred moves in the blink of an eye.

While Ji Zixi held the advantage in the fight, this made Ye Wushuang anxious, and it was troublesome when he was caught by the phoenix fire. He couldn’t remove it anytime soon, which would be dangerous if it accumulated. He began to use his trump card and released a sonic boom as he moved, causing the surrounding space to distort.

Wind blades flew out from him, and this usually gave trouble to his opponent. But Ji Zixi responded as though she had expected it, and a terrifying power swept out from the crown. Flames formed into a phoenix and slowly became purple. Before Ye Wushuang came to his senses, the phoenix turned into an ice phoenix with boundless chill sweeping out from her.

“Indigo Ice Phoenix!” Ji Zixi activated her phoenix bloodline as her eyes became purple, sealing off Ye Wushuang’s path of retreat. A chill began to accumulate and formed into a layer of ice on Ye Wushuang and the ice slowly became thick, soon turning Ye Wushuang into an ice statue under everyone’s eyes.

This brought a massive shock to everyone because no one expected Ye Wushuang, who had the fastest speed, to have his speed restrained.

Ye Wushuang still wanted to struggle, but there was nothing he could do since he was enclosed in ice, not to mention the bizarre Violet Sacred Frostfire. Even a pinnacle Saint Lord like him couldn’t move.

When Ji Zixi let out a roar, the ice statue exploded, and Ye Wushuang fell on one knee, throwing out blood with his face becoming pale. When he raised his head, he looked at Ji Zixi with disbelief.

“You lost,” Ji Zixi said.

The surrounding atmosphere froze since no one expected this battle to end this way, and Ji Zixi became famous because of this battle.

Looking at Ji Zixi, Lin Yun smiled. She had suffered a lot after coming with him to the Heavenly Barren Realm, but the Divine Phoenix Holy Master could finally feel relieved.

Luo Tianxi’s eyes lit up on the throne. Not only he, but most big shots looked at Ji Zixi with admiration. Luo Tianxi gave his evaluation, “She might not be the strongest at her age, but she has the greatest potential.”

“I... admit defeat,” Ye Wushuang smiled bitterly. He had many means that he didn’t use, but he lost so quickly. This meant he wouldn’t even be able to make it into the top ten. He left the stage and said in a self-mocking tone, “I still wanted to face Flower Burial, but I couldn’t defeat a little girl who was by his side. How humiliating...”

When Ye Wushuang finished speaking, a voice sounded like it came from Bai Ye. This person was a good friend of Ye Wushuang, and he was long unhappy with Flower Burial. So he began to comfort Ye Wushuang.

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son spoke out, “That’s right. The ancestral deity won’t just go for the bloodline if he’s picking someone. If that was the case, I wouldn’t have to participate in the banquet since I possess the Qilin Bloodline. Brother Bai, you should make a move and tell everyone there’s nothing impressive about the phoenix bloodline.”

He was long unhappy with Lin Yun, and his hatred for Lin Yun spread to those around him.

“Let me face you!” Bai Ye knew that the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was goading him, but he also wanted to teach Ji Zixi a lesson. He soared to the sky and landed on the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage.

“According to the rules, you can pick your opponent after winning, and you can avoid my challenge or back down. But what I said earlier was directed at you. The phoenix bloodline doesn’t equate to talent, and you can’t just eliminate Ye Wushuang with your background,” Bai Ye said impolitely to Ji Zixi. “Your Sovereign Constellation also came from your bloodline, and you didn’t cultivate it.”

Ji Zixi panicked because the Phoenix Bloodline was her biggest trump card, which allowed her to gain a lot of advantage, and she felt ashamed after facing what Bai Ye said.

“Choose if you want to fight me, challenge someone else, or back down!” Bai Ye said, taking a step forth. He continued, “I won’t force you to choose, and you can decide for yourself.”

Lin Yun frowned because Bai Ye was shameless. Despite saying that he would let Ji Zixi pick, he was slowly pushing her. Ji Zixi was only eighteen, and those words were hurtful to her.

“This is bad,” Yue Weieri said.

“I’ll fight you!” Ji Zixi gritted her teeth. She didn’t like Bai Ye's statement that bloodline doesn’t equate to potential, especially when he said she didn’t rely on her strength to grasp the Sovereign Constellation.

Her Phoenix King Crown might have been bestowed on her as the previous Heavenly Phoenix Maiden received the Sovereign Constellation’s blessing back then.

Ji Zixi was so nervous that her lips moved, and she didn’t know what to do.

A cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes, with rage blazing in his heart. Bai Ye was too much.

When the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son saw Lin Yun’s expression, he smiled.

Taking a deep breath, Ji Zixi calmed herself, and she said, “I’ll fight you.”

At the same time, the Phoenix King Crown disappeared as she called off her Sovereign Constellation.

“Good, come at me. If you can take ten moves from me, consider it your win,” Bai Ye said arrogantly as he looked at Ji Zixi.

Heaven and earth began to tremble as a massive sword broke through the sky and appeared behind Bai Ye. The next moment, a pair of flaming wings appeared on Bai Ye’s back, giving off a powerful aura as they flapped.

When Bai Ye punched forth, flames condensed with his sword aura concentrated.

Ji Zixi grabbed onto a sword, and calmly swung it, “Listening Wind Chime!”

This was the Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s sword technique, and Ji Zixi also knew it. When she swung her sword, a howling roar echoed as she blocked the incoming flaming palm, bringing joy to her eyes. She didn’t use her phoenix bloodline or Sovereign Constellation to take this palm head-on.

But Bai Ye sneered instead, “As expected, you’re nothing without your bloodline, just like Flower Burial. Look carefully; I have yet to bring out half of my strength!”

Before anyone could respond, the flaming palm exploded as hundreds of sword rays flew over. Each sword ray was blazing with flames as they streaked across the stage, bringing shock to everyone. Everyone was shocked by Bai Ye’s strength, who was the chief disciple of the Heavenly Saint Courtyard.

Those worried about Ji Zixi became even more worried, and Xiong Tiannan nearly threw out a mouthful of blood for Ji Zixi, who fell for Bai Ye’s words. If he was in Ji Zixi’s position, he would do the opposite and tell Bai Ye to change fathers if he wanted a better bloodline.

Xiong Tiannan was nervous, but he saw Lin Jiangxian, who was terrifyingly calm. He asked, “Why... aren’t you worried?”

“It doesn’t matter since Lin Yun will make a move,” Lin Jiangxian said.
