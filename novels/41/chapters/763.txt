Chapter 764 - Unfriendly Guests

Qin Yang’s stubbornness made the old man feel helpless as he looked at the sword ray with his brows frowned. He knew that the owner of the aura wasn’t weak.

“Are you sure the beast core is still there?” The old man asked.

“Definitely. It was a monarch beast core, which is impossible for him to refine with his current cultivation. He has to be at least in the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage to do it.” Qin Yang’s pupils were filled with misery as he continued coldly, “That Mountainshaking Demonic Ape became a monarch after it was heavily injured by me, but that brat benefited from my hard work. I’m the only genius that failed to obtain a monarch beast core. No matter what, I have to take it back.”

The Mountainshaking Demonic Ape had become a monarch demonic beast at the very end, so the value of the beast core was immeasurable. Many monstrous geniuses’ wanted to kill a monarch and obtain its beast core. If they refined the beast core, their strength would soar greatly and the monarch aura would benefit them greatly. It could even allow one to awaken their martial intent and allow one’s strength to undergo a transformation.

“Why didn’t you make a move back then?” The old man asked. If Qin Yang did that, they wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble now.

Qin Yang smiled bitterly, “Elder, Qing Ruoyou was slapped by someone and this matter was suppressed by the Indigomoon Elysium. There are rumors that it had something to do with that brat. He even has the Falling Aquatic Empyrean backing him up. Swordmire City was also in the Thunder Prefecture, so I didn’t dare to confirm if it was true. But the Falling Aquatic Empyrean can’t reach the Great Qin Empire.”

Qin Yang’s face turned cold as he continued, “Furthermore, the Nether Prefecture is our territory, so I don’t believe the Sword Firmament Pavilion dares to disobey us.”

With that, they used their movement techniques to go to the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

At the back mountain of the Sword Firmament Pavilion, an azure-clothed figure carried a sword box as he shuttled back and forth across the mountain. With every step he took, he emitted a golden brilliance and a golden crow would cry out.

But the azure-clothed figure had no expression on his face as his speed gradually became even faster. In the end, he could even reach a thousand feet away in one breath. His arms were like a pair of golden wings. This was naturally Lin Yun cultivating the Cloud Soaring Art.

With a light flashing all around, Lin Yun stepped on the air three times. Every single step caused a ripple beneath his feet and he soared into the sky before landing on the opposite mountain. Standing on the mountain, Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he muttered to himself, “I’m riding the clouds to chase the sun. The Cloud Soaring Art is truly profound.”

The Cloud Soaring Art didn’t literally allow one to ride the clouds, but it borrowed the cloud’s strength in the air to move. However, from afar, it would really look like one was riding the clouds. This would only be disproven if one looked carefully. If one could really travel through the air, why would they need to ride the clouds?

“I can only take three steps right now because I haven’t cultivated it long enough. One can take nine steps and create a phenomenon of a dragon soaring through the nine heavens, but I’m not there yet.” Lin Yun spread his arms and landed on the ground firmly. Right at this moment, a brilliant sword ray soared into the sky, drilling a huge hole into the clouds while immense sword intent spread out.

Even the nearby mountains became a hundred meters shorter before this sharp and terrifying aura.

“What powerful Heavenly Soul Realm pressure!” Lin Yun was inwardly startled because there weren’t many Heavenly Soul Realm experts this powerful in the Ancient Southern Domain. Compared to this aura, Wen Yanbo was like an ant.

“Guardian Plum made his breakthrough!” Lin Yun was startled and excitement filled his face.

“Lil’ Purple, take me there.” Lin Yun called for the Indigothunder Dragonvulture as it descended from the sky. After the Indigothunder Dragonvulture brought Lin Yun back to the Great Qin Empire, it wasn’t in a rush to leave. In fact, it even stayed at the Sword Firmament Pavilion. According to the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, its location didn’t matter since it was cultivating the Azure Dragon Enneaform.

It appeared that it stayed behind on purpose to ensure Lin Yun’s safety until the Draconic Banquet. When Lin Yun landed on the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s back, dragon runes poured into its wings as it sped forward.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture carried Lin Yun as they shuttled through the clouds before arriving at the pavilion master’s peak in just a few breaths’ time. Its speed was more than a hundred times faster than Lin Yun could move.

There was no way Lin Yun could compare to it as speed was one of the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s talents as a demonic beast. It made sense since many human cultivators created movement techniques that were derived from ancient demonic beasts, just like the Sun Chasing Divine Art.

When Lin Yun jumped off of the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, the mountain was already filled with people. All the elders and disciples were filled with excitement. Guardian Plum had reached the Heavenly Soul Realm, which would strengthen the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he was pleased. Even after the Old Pavilion Master and Lord Thirteen left, the pavilion was still getting better. It even stabilized with a Heavenly Soul Realm expert of their own.

After the sword ray dissipated, Guardian Plum walked out after being in seclusion for so long. Lin Yun noticed that Guardian PLum’s complexion was great despite the fact that he looked a lot older. His gaze was sharp and his face was rosy. After reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm, his lifespan had naturally increased. This was important since Guardian Plum expended his lifespan to repair Lin Yun’s meridians.

“Congratulations pavilion master for reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm!” The Sword-Bearing Elders took the lead in greeting Guardian Plum before the other elders and disciples followed suit.

After Guardian Plum returned their greetings, his gaze fell onto Lin Yun. Lin Yun smiled as he executed the Cloud Soaring Art and arrived in front of Guardian Plum. Then, he kneeled down and cupped his hands together, “Disciple Lin Yun, greets Gua...Pavilion Master Plum!”

Pavilion Master Plum looked at Lin Yun and laughed, “Hahaha, you can address me however you like. Come, stand up and let me take a good look at you.”

Lin Yun stood up and Pavilion Master Plum started to examine Lin Yun. The more he looked at Lin Yun, the more shocked he became as he could sense a terrifying sword intent coming from Lin Yun. There were also many invincible fireflies around him that almost looked like stars. Pavilion Master Plum was greatly shocked, so he asked, “Your sword intent?”

Lin Yun nodded his head, which stunned Pavilion Master Plum and caused him to laugh, “Haha, great! How great!”

The others had no idea why Pavilion Master Plum was laughing. Then, Pavilion Master Plum turned to look at Luo Feng, “Did Wen Yanbo come to cause trouble while I was in seclusion?”

He had been in seclusion for six months because of Wen Yanbo. If Wen Yanbo wasn’t extinguished, the pavilion would never find peace. Now that he came out of seclusion, it was time for him to get back at them.

The Sword-Bearing Elders and Luo Feng exchanged their glances before Luo Feng spoke, “Pavilion Master, Wen Yanbo came to provoke us a few days ago, but he was killed by Lin Yun with a punch. The Primal Origin Sect no longer exists in the Great Qin Empire now.”

“What?!” Pavilion Master Plum was shocked as he was surprised by this piece of news. Although Wen Yanbo made his breakthrough using a secret technique, he was still a Heavenly Soul Realm expert. He was actually killed by Lin Yun with only a punch?

“Brat, you’ve given me a huge shock,” said Pavilion Master Plum before he asked, “Has Bai Lixuan returned?”

“This…” All the elders wore an awkward expression. After all, Bai Lixuan was Pavilion Master Plum’s direct disciple and he placed huge hopes on Bai Lixuan before Lin Yun came.

Lin Yun pondered briefly before he spoke, “Pavilion Master, he joined the Cloud Trigram Sect. He also helped me out at the Withernorth Sea. Now, he’s one of the brightest geniuses in the Ancient Southern Domain.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Upon hearing that, Pavilion Master Plum and the rest then felt gratified. After all, the Cloud Trigram Sect was one of the nine overlord forces, so it was an honor for them as well. After all, they were now connected with the Cloud Trigram Sect. But they still felt somewhat disappointed because even Lin Yun hadn’t left the Sword Firmament Sect.

“Pavilion Master, there are two people from the Profound Yang Palace to congratulate you on your breakthrough.” Someone came forward at this moment and cupped their hands together. This made everyone’s faces change as the Profound Yang Palace responded too quickly. Furthermore, it made no sense for them to come and congratulate him personally.

Pavilion Master Plum pondered briefly before he said, “Bring them to the main hall. I’ll go and meet them.”

The disciple then paused briefly before he continued, “They wanted Senior Brother Lin to come along.”

Pavilion Master Plum was briefly stunned before his face sank, “They’re not here on a friendly trip. Sword-Bearing elders, come along with me.”

“I’ll come as well.” Lin Yun was also curious why the Profound Yang Palace was looking for him. He didn’t seem to have any issues with the Profound Yang Palace aside from Qin Yang. But if it was that person, he roughly had an idea why they came.
