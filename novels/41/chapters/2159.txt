Chapter 2160 - I Will Guard The Glory Of The Heavenly Path!

Gu Xiyan’s gaze was indifferent. It wasn’t because he was looking down on Ye Qingtian, but he respected Flower Burial as a fellow Champion of the Heavenly Paths. Although he had never met Lin Yun before, he looked forward to meeting him.

Lin Yun bitterly smiled, “What do you mean by 'pretending'?”

Gu Xiyan’s gaze became sharp, and he indifferently said, “Don’t tell me that you think you can be compared to Flower Burial after being praised as a prodigy swordsman by everyone?”

Earlier when Ye Qingtian defeated his opponents, many cultivators were discussing if Ye Qingtian could be compared to Flower Burial. After all, they were both swordsmen, and it was natural for people to compare them together.

If it was in the past, someone would definitely compare them together. But those words were a little too much for Gu Xiyan. After all, who was Flower Burial? Gu Xiyan had willingly given up the top spot on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking for him, so he naturally wouldn’t accept putting Ye Qingtian on the same level as Flower Burial.

“I never thought of that before,” Lin Yun said helplessly.

It was fine if it was someone else, but he was Flower Burial. So why did he have to compete with himself?

But Gu Xiyan didn’t believe it, and he coldly said, “I’m afraid you’re thinking of it despite what you’re saying. Not only did you provoke me, but you even dare claim to be on the same level as Flower Burial? You clearly don’t place Flower Burial in your eyes, nor place me in your eyes. You have always been an arrogant person, but you don’t dare to admit it?”

Gu Xiyan took a step forth, circulating his Qilin Saint Physique with a powerful pressure spreading out. As lightning began to crackle on his body, the entire Heavenly Dragon Stage began to tremble.

Lin Yun maintained his silence and decided that it was best for him not to speak.

“Ye Qingtian has cowered!”

“Indeed, only Gu Xiyan can deal with him.”

“Ye Qingtian was arrogant before, pushing two people to the dragon lord's position, but he didn’t even dare to let out a fart in front of Gu Xiyan.”

“Haha. Who’s Gu Xiyan? He was someone who killed his way out of the Heavenly Path. Tian Gu was arrogant, but he didn’t hesitate to kill Tian Gu. Even if Ye Qingtian is arrogant, he’s also a person.”

Unharmonious voices resounded around the Dragon Mountain. After all, Ye Qingtian didn’t have a good reputation when compared to Gu Xiyan. There were naturally those who disliked Ye Qingtian, wanting to trample on him.

Ji Zixi wasn’t happy and was anxious because Ye Qingtian was Lin Yun. But she couldn’t possibly reveal it.

“I’ll treat your silence as an acknowledgment.” Gu Xiyan’s face became cold as he took a step forth with his fighting spirits boiling. As an indigo radiance swept out, it looked like a domain with Gu Xiyan standing in the middle, clad in layers of indigo lightning.

Although he might be unhappy with Ye Qingtian, he didn’t look down on the latter. Even with the Qilin Saint Physique, he was still fearful of Ye Qingtian’s sword intent since he had clearly seen how Gu Xinyu was defeated.

“Even if Flower Burial isn’t around, I will guard the glory of the Heavenly Paths, and it’s not your time to provoke us!” The moment Gu Xiyan said that, his fighting spirits exploded, forming into flames.

The flames even left a hole in the sky, and all the cultivators on the Dragon Mountain could sense his terrifying fighting spirits.

Lin Yun’s expression also became grave because Gu Xiyan was a little too hot-blooded.,

“Myriad Incinerating Flames—Rising Dragon!” When Gu Xiyan’s fighting spirit reached the limit, it finally exploded and he dashed forth, throwing a punch. His punch released a blazing wind that blew on Lin Yun’s hair.

Everything happened so quickly, but Lin Yun dodged without the time to think. When he landed on the ground with one knee, he took a deep breath because there was a hole where he had previously stood. He couldn’t imagine the consequences if this punch landed on him.

As his sixth sense began to tingle, Lin Yun soared to the sky. As the Heavenly Dragon Stage trembled, a hole was left in the air with Lin Yun being shattered into pieces by that punch.

A series of exclamations came from the surroundings with everyone’s hearts nearly jumping out of their chests. When Lin Yun appeared on the other side, everyone finally realized that Gu Xiyan only destroyed an afterimage that Lin Yun left behind. Lin Yun’s speed was so fast that it couldn’t be tracked with the naked eye.

In a short moment, Gu Xiyan threw out ten-odd punches. Saint disciples who were slightly weaker couldn’t even keep up with Gu Xiyan and Lin Yun. They could only sense a suffocating pressure coming from Gu Xiyan. If they were the ones facing Gu Xiyan, they might not even be able to take an attack head-on from Gu Xiyan. They would immediately be ripped into pieces.

“Holy shit, is Gu Xiyan still human? He’s simply a wargod!”

“This is too unbelievable. His strength should be the strongest of those at the Indigo Origin Phase. The pressure coming from him is too strong.”

“Ye Qingtian has a disadvantage because his sword intent is completely suppressed under this pressure. There’s a huge gap between them in terms of their cultivation.”

“It’s really not easy for Ye Qingtian…” Many people shook their heads with pity on their faces. Before the fight started, there were still people who were unhappy with Ye Qingtian. But after the fight began, everyone only had admiration and sympathy for Ye Qingtian.

Someone like Gu Xiyan could only be suppressed by Quasi-Saints at the Heavenly Origin Phase, and Ye Qingtian had won their admiration for daring to fight Gu Xiyan. But even if Ye Qingtian had won their admiration, they didn’t think that he stood a chance against Gu Xiyan.

Right then, dazzling sword rays lit up on the Heavenly Dragon Stage, accompanied by a boundless sword intent. The sword rays tore apart the lightning that enveloped the entire stage before sweeping out like a tidal wave.

Outside the Dragon Mountain, the eyes of all the swordsmen lit up. As long as the sword was still around, a swordsman could put up a fight. No matter what, the hearts of the swordsmen outside the Dragon Mountain were on Lin Yun’s side. They were emotional, wanting to see if Ye Qingtian’s sword could create another miracle.

“Qilin’s Rage!” As lightning exploded on Gu Xiyan, a Thunder Qilin appeared that formed into an armor that enveloped him. When Gu Xiyan threw a punch, his punch was accompanied by a loud explosion that shattered the incoming sword ray like glass.

With a huge clash, the domineering power knocked the Flower Burial Sword away from Lin Yun’s hand. This created a wound on Lin Yun’s palm with blood splashing out, causing all the swordsmen present to exclaim, “How is this possible?!”

“To shatter the Astral Sword Intent head-on, this is too unbelievable!” All the swordsmen present were in despair because this was outrageous. The sword intent represented invincibility in terms of offensive abilities, and not many people could shatter sword intent head-on when both parties were of the same cultivation level, not to mention that it was the Astral Sword Intent.

In the eyes of many, the Astral Sword Intent was a legend, and it should represent invincibility at the Quasi-Saint Realm. But what happened had shattered their views, striking a huge impact on them.

“There’s always someone stronger in the world. There are three thousand daos, and the sword dao isn’t invincible,” Ye Linghao coldly commented.

“I have been waiting for your sword. I noticed that you’re over-reliant on it.” Gu Xiyan looked at Lin Yun indifferently, looking like an indifferent wargod. When the Flower Burial Sword was knocked away, he dashed forth like an actual Qilin.

At the same time, a constellation unfolded behind him. It was a boundless and ancient lightning pool. The entire painting was filled with lightning while the sky was dark, and Gu Xiyan was intending to end this battle.

“Myriad Incinerating Flames—Crushing Evil!” Gu Xiyan roared as he approached, combining the two greater daos together in this punch. Before his punch even reached Lin Yun, the powerful gale produced by the punch already left cracks in the surrounding space.

"Dragon Sun and Moon Seal—Inverting Yin-Yang!"

When the punch was about to reach Lin Yun, a golden dragon manifested in the sky while a silver phoenix manifested on the ground. When Lin Yun formed the seal with his hands, the heaven and earth inverted with space being distorted. But it was futile because the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal couldn’t stop Gu Xiyan, who continued to charge at him.

All the phenomena created by Lin Yun were shattered by Gu Xiyan’s punch. It didn’t matter what he tried, and Gu Xiyan broke it all with brute strength. This was because Gu Xiyan’s punch was too domineering, not to mention that it was empowered with the Qilin Saint Physique and armor. The strength Gu Xiyan displayed at this moment left many people dumbfounded.

“Myriad Incinerating Flames!” Gu Xiyan roared as the sky was dyed in flames once more, and no one knew how many times this was. As flames covered the sky, it cast a golden layer of radiance down on Gu Xiyan.

Gu Xiyan charged forth with brute strength, bearing the sword intent that was in the surroundings. When he got close to Lin Yun, he threw his punch.

Lin Yun managed to dodge Gu Xiyan’s punch, but the latter’s punch left a massive hole in the space. As Gu Xiyan advanced, he would force Lin Yun to retreat whenever he threw his punches, not to mention that the speed of his punches were increasing.

“Still not going to admit defeat?” The fighting spirits within Gu Xiyan’s eyes had turned into crimson flames as he became enveloped in murderous intent. Since Ye Qingtian wasn’t going to surrender, he had no intentions of going easy anymore. “Let’s end this game here!”

Gu Xiyan was someone who slaughtered his way out of the Heavenly Path, and he wasn’t an indecisive person. After making up his mind, he dashed forth and executed the attack he used on Tian Gu, “Myriad Incinerating Flames—Baptism Light!”

This made everyone take a deep breath because Gu Xiyan wasn’t going easy on Ye Qingtian at all. The hearts of all the Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples were lifted to their throats, and they didn’t dare to watch what would happen next.

The attack released by Gu Xiyan was accompanied with a dazzling radiance that made many people squint. While being stunned by the terrifying pressure that he was radiating, everyone held their breaths as they continued to watch.

But what they were expecting didn’t take place because Ye Qingtian wasn’t ripped apart by this punch. There was still a dazzling radiance coming from the stage, but the situation seemed to have fallen into a stalemate with Gu Xiyan’s attack being blocked.

But how was this possible? Everyone was shocked. When the dazzling radiance settled down a little, everyone was dumbfounded to see Lin Yun reaching out with his right hand, grabbing onto Gu Xiyan’s fist. He had merely used one hand to block Gu Xiyan’s attack.

Everyone couldn’t believe what they were seeing. They couldn’t believe that Ye Qingtian relied on his physique to block this attack after losing his sword. After all, Tian Gu was blown into smithereens by this attack.

But the reality was undeniable because Ye Qingtian really managed to stop Gu Xiyan’s attack with one hand, stopping the latter from advancing any further.

Gu Xiyan was also shocked as he muttered, “H-How is this possible?”

As blood dripped down the corner of Lin Yun’s lips, he smiled, “I already said that I have only used half of my strength so far. So why didn’t everyone believe me? Don’t bully me just because I’m an honest person since even an honest person has his temper. So what if I want to compare myself with Flower Burial? I even call myself Flower Burial, but what can you do to me?”

Lin Yun laughed with his hair fluttering in the wind as he unleashed the full power of the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. The dragon’s blood began to boil like magma followed by a dragon roar.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

When Lin Yun stomped his foot on the ground, a crack began to appear on the stage as Lin Yun relied on the power of his divine physique to throw Gu Xiyan off.

The stage trembled along with the entire Dragon Mountain when Gu Xiyan fell onto the ground.

“Hahaha! It looks like there’s nothing impressive about the Qilin Saint Physique!” Lin Yun laughed as he hovered in the air and summoned the Flower Burial Sword back.

“I am Flower Burial, burying both flowers and people alike!” When Lin Yun grabbed onto the sword, his hair fluttered in the wind as he continued to laugh, “Gu Xiyan, let me guard the honor of the Heavenly Paths, instead.”

When Gu Xiyan raised his head, he was stumped because it was as though Ye Qingtian and Flower Burial had overlapped together at this moment.
