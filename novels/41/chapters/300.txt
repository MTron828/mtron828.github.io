Chapter 301 - One Punch is Enough

“Big Sister, Big Brother Zhong seems to be using the Dragon-Tiger Fist. Is he related to Lin Yun?” Lin Yan was dumbfounded when she saw Lin Yun’s aura rising.

Lin Qiushan smiled bitterly, “How is he still your Big Brother Zhong? Who else aside from Lin Yun is proficient in the Dragon-Tiger Fist and Seven Profound Steps in the outer sect? Zhong Yunxiao is Lin Yun!”

Lin Yan was shocked by her elder sister’s words. So it turns out that the person she admired had been around her the entire time. When she recalled how she ridiculed Lin Yun along the way, her expression became complicated. She had no idea what she should do now that she realized Zhong Yunxiao was actually Lin Yun.

In contrast to Lin Yan, everyone else only had shock in their hearts. The Gentlemen Union had been searching for Lin Yun’s tracks throughout the Burial Sword Peak. Everyone thought that Lin Yun would keep a low-profile for the first round, but who would have thought that he would trick everyone with a mask and even obtain the first Imperial Sword Herb.

Even more shocking was the fact that he had never used his martial techniques along the way. Just how confident was he? His Dragon-Tiger Fist was famous in the Firmament Sword Pavilion and using it would reveal his identity. The fight right now was a great example of it.

“Holy…so it turns out that Zhong Yunxiao was actually Lin Yun all along.”

“I’ve never seen someone so bold. He actually managed to obtain the Imperial Sword Herb despite the bounty on his head.”

“No wonder he was so arrogant. It all makes sense, it’s because he’s Lin Yun. Even Xue Feng was killed by him, so why would he be bothered with a few inner disciples?”

“It looks like Lin Yun is becoming serious this time.”

There was no doubt that the upcoming battle would be exciting. Everyone knew how powerful Lin Yun was, especially now that he was no longer holding back. As Lin Yun slowly walked towards the inner disciples, his aura grew to an unbelievable height, which caused Mu Ling’s face to change. He was bearing the huge pressure from Lin Yun.

“So what if you didn’t use any martial techniques? I’ll still make you kneel even if you use them!” Mu Ling roared and charged over. His fists roared like bolts of lightning at Lin Yun.

Just a moment ago, Mu Ling used the advantage of his spiritual cultivation technique to catch Lin Yun by surprise. And when he used it again, the martial technique immediately summoned thunderclouds in the sky.

Lin Yun smiled. Mu Ling was actually trying to use the same attack against him twice. He was merely caught by surprise when Mu Ling launched the sneak attack towards him. Did Mu Ling really think that his fist technique was inferior?

Lin Yun decided to let Mu Ling have an experience of a genuine fist technique. Looking at the charging Mu Ling, Lin Yun calmly faced him and formed the Undying Vajra Seal. When his aura surged, he abruptly threw his punches. Lin Yun’s aura was like a volcano that had erupted.

With the Undying Vajra Seal, Lin Yun faced Mu Ling’s Thunder Fist head-on. The two exchanged punches and each collision caused a commotion that even made the earth tremble. Mu Ling would take a step back with every collision and after the tenth collision, the rage on his face turned into fear. His face turned pale. Facing Lin Yun felt like facing an ancient beast to Mu Ling. Worst of all, Lin Yun’s punches contained sword intent, which burrowed into his body and wreaked havoc.

“I don’t believe that I won’t be able to take you down!” Mu Ling’s eyes were bloodshot and he pushed the origin energy within his body to the limit. He managed to make the Thunder Fist a lot stronger.

Unlike Mu Ling’s insanity, Lin Yun calmly performed the Dragon-Tiger Fist. Combined with the Iris Sword Sutra and sword intent, Lin Yun easily suppressed Mu Ling. After another ten clashes, Mu Ling finally couldn’t suppress his injuries anymore and threw up a huge mouthful of blood.

He was blown away and fell onto the ground. Grabbing his chest and throwing up mouthfuls of blood, he yelled at Lin Yun, “This is impossible! How is the quality of your origin energy stronger than mine!”

There was no way a spiritual cultivation technique could be compared with a profound cultivation technique. But the quality of Lin Yun’s origin energy was on a whole new level.

His words made Lin Yun inwardly sneer. It would be a joke if the Iris Sword Sutra was incomparable to a spiritual cultivation technique. Mu Ling would barely be comparable to Lin Yun if his cultivation technique reached complete mastery or if his cultivation was a level higher. Otherwise, there was no way Mu Ling’s cultivation technique could compare to the eighth stage of the Iris Sword Sutra.

“Senior Brother Mu!” The three inner disciples were dumbfounded when Mu Ling was defeated.

“The formation! Use the Three-Demise Sword Formation to kill him!” said Mu Ling anxiously.

“Kill!” The three exchanged a glance and drew their swords. The sword buzz echoed in the air once more. The endless flow of attacks from the Three-Demise Sword Formation was dazzling. But it was a pity that Lin Yun had no intention of comprehending anything from the formation this time.

He would have some concern if these inner disciples’ Three-Demise Sword Formation reached greater mastery. But now? Since it was full of weaknesses, it was a pipe dream for the inner disciples to defeat him. In the end, it was just a half-baked sword formation.

“Are you still not going to draw your sword? Lin Yun, you must be courting death!” Mu Ling’s eyes flashed sinisterly. He was under the impression that Lin Yun was paying the price for being arrogant.

“Is he really not going to draw his sword?” Lin Qiushan and everyone else were confused. They knew that Lin Yun became famous with the Overlord Sword to defeat Ye Liuyun. So they felt that Lin Yun could contend with the Three-Demise Sword Formation if he used the Overlord Sword.

However, Lin Yun remained calm. The fight had already ended when he was determined to start using martial techniques. The outcome was determined in the blink of an eye. Facing the Three-Demise Sword Formation, all Lin Yun needed was one punch.

Lin Yun gently snorted and raised his right hand. His sword intent, origin energy, and dracophant energy combined together. The energies formed a dense aura around him that made him look as if he was enveloped in demonic miasma.

“This is…?” No one had any idea of what Lin Yun was trying to do. But right when the Three-Demise Sword Formation was about to suppress him, Lin Yun threw out a punch, executing Dragon Painting. The demonic miasma suddenly spread out like a painting of a soaring dragon.

The endless sword aura in the Three-Demise Sword Formation collapsed. After the punch wreaked havoc, the sleeves of the three inner disciples were covered in injuries and they kneeled on the ground. They also threw up blood while looking at Lin Yun with fear. They were defeated without being able to see the punch. This shocked everyone, including Mu Ling.

“Dragon Painting?” Gu Feiyun was shocked. He recognized the technique that Lin Yun used, but it felt entirely different from the usual Dragon Painting. Lin Yun’s Dragon Painting felt majestic and elegant.

“Senior Brother Chen, Senior Brother Gu, you two can get up.” Lin Yun withdrew his punch and turned to the side of the statue. His words immediately made everyone stand up. The inner disciples were terrified when they saw the outer disciples approaching.

The inner disciples were all terrified since they didn’t have the capability to put up another fight. At the same time, the crowd sighed when they recalled how arrogant these inner disciples were half an hour ago.

Chen Ling stepped forth and kicked the inner disciples, “Boss Zhon… Brother Lin, what should we do with them?”

“Take back your interspatial pouches,” said Lin Yun.

Everyone thanked Lin Yun as they retrieved their own interspatial pouches. When Mu Ling saw the outer disciples gathering over, he smiled bitterly, “Senior Brother Lin, can you let us go? If we meet again in the second round, we’ll listen to your orders.”

“Hehe, you bastards still want to participate in the Alliance-Union Battle? Deam on. Big Brother, why don’t you leave them to me? I just thought of how to deal with them…” Li Wuyou chuckled with a sly look in his eyes, which sent a chill down the inner disciples’ spines.

“Alright. I’ll leave them to you.”

“Alrighty!” Li Wuyou chuckled and started messing with the inner disciples.

“Brother Zhong, you’ve hidden your identity really well from us…” Lin Qiushan also came up with a bitter smile and shock in her eyes.

“I had my reasons for doing so. Sir Lin, please don’t be offended. Actually, I should’ve guessed it. Zhong Yunxiao, the ancient Phoenix Plum ringing throughout the horizon. You already gave us a clue about your identity,” smiled Lin Qiushan. Her explanation made everyone understand the meaning behind the name of Lin Yun’s persona as Zhong Yunxiao.

“Lady Lin is truly smart,” replied Lin Yun.

“Are you praising me or are you humiliating me? I only noticed it after you disclosed your identity. So, you have no intention of showing us your face?” smiled Lin Qiushan, looking at the mask that Lin Yun was wearing.

Lin Yun grabbed the mask and removed it, revealing a youthful face with defined features. He removed the mask and his eyes were so sharp that no one dared to look at him in the eyes. When Lin Yan popped her head out behind Lin Qiushan to take a look at Lin Yun, she blushed.

“Big Brother, I’m done!” Li Wuyou’s voice rang out right at this moment.

The five inner disciples were all stripped naked and tied to the two stone statues at the entrance. When everyone looked at the humiliation on their faces, they couldn’t help but laugh.

“Didn’t these people look down on us just because they’re inner disciples? We’ll let everyone have a clear view of the grace of an inner disciples,” chuckled Li Wuyou.

“Haha, Brother Li, well done!”

“That’s great. Didn’t these people want to snatch people’s Swordcloud Core? Let’s see how they snatch it now!”

Everyone laughed when they saw the pitiful outcome of the inner disciples.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
