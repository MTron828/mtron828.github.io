Chapter 853 - Azure Firmament Sword Sutra

When Lin Yun circulated the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra, he also started to refine the divine dragon aura. Refining the dragon aura made the azure origin energy in his meridians grow, which caused his meridians to swell. At the same time, some clogged meridians were instantly cleared up.

“Wow, the divine dragon aura actually helped me progress in the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra very quickly…” Lin Yun was rejoicing because he was worried that the new sutra would be difficult to cultivate. However, it wasn’t as difficult as he had imagined it would be.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. Suddenly, a dragon roar echoed out as strands of azure sword ray exploded around Lin Yun. This was a sign that his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra had reached the fourth stage.

Even though Lin Yun knew he would make a breakthrough, he never thought it would happen in just three days. It was a little too unbelievable to him because he had spent a lot of time cultivating the Iris Sword Sutra. He didn’t know if it was thanks to the strong foundation he obtained from the Iris Sword Sutra or if the dragon aura mysteriously helped him.

When the azure origin energy flowed into his dantian, it formed into a current of azure and purple. The azure color represented the wind while the purple represented the lightning. With the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra reaching the fourth stage, not only could he wield wind, but he could also control lightning. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun instantly understood what was going on as he recalled the sword sutra explanation. At this moment, the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra was inferior to his Iris Sword Sutra. After all, his Iris Sword Sutra was at the twelfth stage.

When Lin Yun observed the Iris Flower at the center of the yin-yang ring, he couldn’t help feeling reluctant. If he had a choice, he wouldn’t want to give up on cultivating the Iris Sword Sutra. After all, it was thanks to the Iris Sword Sutra that he got this far. It wasn’t just a simple cultivation technique to him, but it was his inheritance that he was fond of.

However, the technique was incomplete. A complete fortune martial technique wasn’t something that someone in the Xiantian Realm could cultivate, so he never noticed its shortcoming. Since he only had two months left, he needed a complete fortune martial technique to survive. Only then, could he search for the complete Iris Sword Sutra in the Kunlun Realm.

Suddenly, a tear dropped into the space of his dantian and onto the Iris Flower. It was a tear from Lin Yun’s heart.

I’m sorry, but please understand. I will complete you in the future and spread your fame throughout the Kunlun Realm! Lin Yun swore with his dignity as a swordsman on the line.

Collecting his thoughts, Lin Yun continued to refine the dragon aura before pouring it into the azure-purple current. Before he knew it, seven days had passed. In a short amount of time, Lin Yun reached the fifth stage of the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. His azure-purple current became even bigger and began to look like two dragons.

Vaguely, he sensed powerful wind, lightning, and sword energy that coursed through his body. As he sat down, wind and lightning radiated from his body before manifesting into sword rays that revolved around his body.

The terrifying phenomenon had summoned all of the wind and lightning in the valley. Lin Yun could sense that the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra in the fifth stage was now comparable to his Iris Sword Sutra in the twelfth stage. In the following half month, Lin Yun completely refined the divine dragon aura with his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra in an attempt to reach the sixth stage.

His azure-purple aura combined, forming a massive tree trunk filled with boundless sword aura. As the tree became even more refined, branches started to grow. However, it seemed like the branches were blocked by an invisible sword aura. This meant that Lin Yun couldn’t make a breakthrough. He knew that with the Iris Sword Sutra around, he wouldn’t be able to make a genuine breakthrough in the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra.

“Break!” Lin Yun ultimately made a decision as boundless sword energy flew towards the Iris Flower to shatter it. In that moment, it felt like thousands of swords had pierced through his heart. Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood as his face turned pale.

Without the Iris Sword Sutra stopping the phenomenon, the tree trunk instantly grew eighteen branches. The Azure Firmament Tree’s initial form had blossomed in full. However, it didn’t have any leaves. The branches represented eighteen different sword auras, each with terrifying capabilities. Furthermore, they could fuse with his thunderstorm intent at any time.

There was no question that the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra in the sixth stage had surpassed the Iris Sword Sutra in the twelfth stage. This made Lin Yun happy and sad at the same time. He was exceptionally sad that his Iris Sword Sutra was gone.

Right at this moment, the space where the yin-yang circle resided suddenly shined bright as a total of 120 petals appeared. The petals shined like stars in the night. When Lin Yun saw this, he became so excited that he teared up. The Iris Sword Sutra still existed.

Then, Lin Yun noticed that the petals were scattered around. When he looked closely, it looked like a boundless sword array had enveloped the Azure Firmament Tree. He could sense that the Iris Sword Sutra wasn’t complete and that there were many places where it was lacking.

But even so, it was a beautiful outline of a majestic array. With Lin Yun’s scope, he could only see a corner of it.

“If that’s the case, I can nourish the Iris Sword Sutra while cultivating the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. If my Azure Firmament Sword Sutra reaches the pinnacle in the end, it can mend the Iris Sword Sutra.” Lin Yun realized that he would have to put in twice the effort for half the result.

Lin Yun had been prepared to give up on the Iris Sword Sutra. However, it remained, so he would have a firm foundation to complete the Iris Sword Sutra in the future.

“Perhaps this happened because they have related attributes. If it was a fire attributed fortune martial technique, the outcome might have been different.” Lin Yun could only guess the reason.

Lin Yun didn’t think too much about it and opened his eyes that sparked with lightning. When Lin Yun looked into the distance, he locked onto the forbidden zone of the flaming mountain.

With a single thought, one of the tree branches broke off and fell onto his palm. Fine lightning began to crackle on his palm that looked like swords and dragons. As they wandered around his palm, the wind and lightning energies manifested into a sea of swords.

Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Sutra! With a flick of his finger, the lightning on his palm entered his finger and shot out. Instantly, a portion of the flaming mountain was sliced off.

A huge boom came from the mountain, which shocked Lin Yun because he didn’t expect his attack to be so fast, “What speed!”

“I didn’t even use the Flicking Divine Finger or the Iris Sword Sutra. I wonder what would happen if I used all the branches?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts with interest filling his eyes.
