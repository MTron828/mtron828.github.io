Chapter 308 - Monstrous Talents

A sword buzz rang out and Chu Haoyu’s sword trembled. His sword aura pierced into the horizon like golden rays, which then condensed into fine golden threads that enveloped Jiang Feng. This scene left Jiang Feng shocked because he never expected that Chu Haoyu would be so decisive. Chu Haoyu had completely disregarded the threat of his words and his strength.

Jiang Feng’s face sank. Since Chu Haoyu wanted to fight, then he would give Chu Haoyu a fight. “You guys back off for now!”

He first got the Asura Alliance’s disciples to back off and took a step forward with the Originmurk Art circulating in his body. When he threw his palm forward to shatter the golden threads, the density of his origin energy left everyone shocked.

“That’s the Originmurk Art in complete mastery?”

“Who could’ve imagined that he would be so powerful? No wonder he’s ranked third!”

“I’m afraid that he’s the only one with his cultivation technique in complete mastery.” The surrounding disciples discussed what just happened among themselves. Even Lin Yun was surprised by this. Every cultivation technique would undergo a drastic transformation upon reaching complete mastery. Even though Jiang Feng’s Originmurk Energy was only a transcendent profound cultivation technique, he reached complete mastery with it.

This meant that spiritual cultivation techniques beneath greater mastery were nothing to him. Even Lin Yun wouldn’t have an advantage if the Iris Sword Sutra didn’t reach the eighth stage. But it wouldn’t be easy for Jiang Feng if he only wanted to rely on his cultivation technique to defeat Chu Haoyu. After all, Chu Haoyu’s attack wasn’t that simple.

A smile rose on Lin Yun’s lips because this battle was becoming more interesting.

Jiang Feng’s origin energy surged and he crushed the twenty golden threads made of sword intent. He glanced at Chu Haoyu and sneered, “Chu Haoyu, you didn’t expect this, right? I already reached complete mastery in the Originmurk Art half a year ago and I can reach the manifestation stage if I take another step forward. Now, you won’t be able to defeat me in three moves like in the past!”

Jiang Feng’s gaze looked vicious and his words revealed some secrets. So it turns out that Jiang Feng had challenged Chu Haoyu discreetly a year ago and he was defeated in three moves.

Everyone turned to look at Chu Haoyu with shock. How strong was he if he could defeat Jiang Feng in three moves a year ago?

“In the end, garbage is ultimately garbage. So what if you reached complete mastery relying on resources? A swordsman ultimately has to rely on his sword. It looks like you still do not understand my sword at all,” said Chu Haoyu disdainfully.

What does that mean? Jiang Feng’s face changed. The golden threads that he crushed suddenly reappeared and intertwined together.

“Turbulent Cloud!” roared Chu Haoyu. Chu Haoyu raised his sword and the threads began to weave together into a painting that came crashing down towards Jiang Feng.

Jiang Feng’s face changed. He immediately retreated and threw his palms forward. His attacks that could even kill disciples in the fifth stage only left holes in the sea of clouds. The cloud was surging too quickly and was about to devour Jiang Feng.

Everyone was shocked when they saw this scene because Chu Haoyu’s Cloudstun Sword was also at complete mastery. The Cloudstun Sword was the hardest sword technique to practice in the Sword Firmament Pavilion aside from forbidden techniques. Not to mention greater mastery, it was hard for disciples to even obtain lesser mastery with it.

Everyone was shocked when they found out that Chu Haoyu’s Cloudstun Sword was at greater mastery. But with this new revelation, all the disciples were dumbfounded. Even the disciples who were fighting with the Flaming Souls were distracted by the commotion.

Then, the smile on Jiang Feng’s face disappeared. Although he didn’t practice the Cloudstun Sword, he heard that it was on the same level as the Seven Profound Steps. It originated from an ancient martial technique and the difficulty could be imagined since Lin Yun only managed to reach greater mastery in six months.

Chu Haoyu must’ve reached complete mastery after refining the Imperial Sword Herb. With the tables suddenly turning around, Jiang Feng was now in danger.

Chu Haoyu sneered, “You dare to launch a sneak attack at me with that strength? Impudent!”

Right at this moment, a golden figure dashed over and stood before the sea of clouds.

“Who is it?!” The sea of clouds caused a huge commotion, with the sword intent that was raining down. When the sea of clouds disappeared, everyone was shocked when they saw who it was. It was Ye Xiu who was second on the Mortal Ranking.

Chu Haoyu’s attack was still so terrifying after being weakened. However, Ye Xiu destroyed it with a punch, which left everyone shocked. It was even more shocking that Ye Xiu relied on his physique to take that attack head-on.

“The Golden Vajra Body?” Lin Yun instantly recognized the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s body-refining martial technique. The Golden Vajra Body was inferior to the Dracophant Battle Physique and Ye Xiu probably reached the fifth stage to have such defences. Prior to this revelation, no one knew that Ye Xiu also practised a body-refining martial technique.

“Why the hell are there so many monsters in the outer sect?” sighed Chang Wu, clicking his tongue. First, it was Lin Yun who combined the Dragon-Tiger Fist’s seals, then it was the unparalleled swordsman Chu Haoyu, now there was a Jiang Feng whose cultivation technique reached complete mastery, and finally there was Ye Xiu with a terrifying physique.

The nearby inner disciples couldn’t help grumbling inwardly. After all, Chang Wu was also a monster in his own right. He was clearly the last on the Earth Ranking, but the strength he showed when he fought Chu Haoyu was incredible.

“Thanks.” Jiang Feng didn’t seem surprised by Ye Xiu’s Golden Vajra Body. It was clear that the two had reached some sort of agreement before the Alliance-Union Battle.

“Junior Brother Ye, you want to go against me too?” questioned Chu Haoyu.

“I dare not, but what Junior Brother Chu said was right. You said that you’ll kill anyone who stands in your way, so are you going to kill me as well if I’m also fighting to be the champion? No matter what, we will do our best to become the champion!” replied Ye Xiu with a firm gaze.

Chu Haoyu’s eyes flickered. He then shook his head, “I understand. But Junior Brother Ye, you still don’t seem to understand some things. There are some things in the world that cannot be obtained through hard work alone. After all, why will there be a need for geniuses if hard work is useful?”

The atmosphere between the three started to become intense. Chu Haoyu’s words were arrogant, which reflected his pride and confidence in becoming the champion. He had also formed an irreconcilable grudge with Ye Xiu and Jiang Feng.

Far away, Li Wuyou asked, “Big Brother, why did these people suddenly fight among themselves? Aren’t they Wang Yan’s lackeys? After all, they even proclaimed that they’re going to kill you.”

“Kill me? Wang Yan only promised 1,000 second-grade spiritual jades, but by becoming the champion in the Alliance-Union Battle, one can obtain a cosmic artifact,” replied Lin Yun. In a nutshell, the top ten on the Mortal Ranking weren’t tied together, so it was impossible for one person to win over everyone.

This was why they could let go of the promise when there were more benefits before them. Furthermore, it wasn’t impossible to kill Lin Yun and obtain the cosmic treasure. After all, didn’t becoming the champion also mean that they would have a chance to kill Lin Yun?

“Even the lowest grade cosmic artifact costs about 8,000 second-grade spiritual jades, not to mention that the sect won’t give a cheap reward,” said Lin Qiushan when she suddenly appeared before the two of them.

The Sword Firmament Pavilion would embarrass themselves if the reward is the weakest cosmic artifact. After all, they were one of the four transcendent sects. Then again, they wouldn’t give that good of a reward either. It made more sense for them to keep it for themselves.

“Will they really fight?” Li Wuyou asked curiously. This was no longer a battle between the top three, but also between the Gentlemen Union, Asura Alliance, and Lone-Star Alliance.

“I’m not sure, but Chu Haoyu will probably go after Jiang Feng based on his personality. But this final battle has also exceeded his expectations. He might be strong, but he won’t be able to suppress everyone. Furthermore, it will also benefit Chang Wu if they fight.” Lin Qiushan shook her head. She was also rooting for Lin Yun subconsciously.

No one could predict the Alliance-Union Battle’s outcome, but there was finally some signs now. Only five people were qualified to obtain the championship prize and Chu Haoyu naturally had the highest chancee among the five. The second would be Chang Wu, the darkhorse that appeared out of nowhere. Then, it would be Ye Xiu, Jiang Feng, and Lin Yun.

Just when the three of them fell into a stalemate, flames suddenly surged on Chang Wu’s body. He finally couldn’t hold it back anymore. He wanted to refine the crystals sneakily in the Sword Tomb.

He attracted everyone’s gaze and countless inner disciples were shocked when they saw the flame blazing on him. Chang Wu revealed an awkward smile and spoke out, “Why are you guys looking at me? I’m just refining a crystal secretly.”

“Junior Brother Chang, your jade plaque!” The inner disciples pointed at the jade plaque Chang Wu hung on his waist. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When Chang Wu lowered his head, he exclaimed out in shock, “What the hell?”

His jade plaque initially had dozens of stars, but it now had over a hundred stars.
