Chapter 1370 - I Swear!

Everyone looked at Lin Yun in disbelief and shock because they couldn’t comprehend what had just happened.

“What’s going on?” Feng Jue, who got back up, was utterly left dumbfounded when he saw Zhuge Qingyun sent flying from a kick by Lin Yun. Since when did his junior brother become so powerful?

Tian Xuanzi's expression also became uncertain as he waved his hand and pulled Zhuge Qingyun, who was lying on the ground, over. Just like that, Zhuge Qingyun’s body disappeared before everyone’s eyes.

“I suppressed a king?” Not only was everyone else in disbelief, but even Lin Yun couldn’t believe what he had just accomplished. He didn’t feel that his strength had improved. But when he attacked earlier, he felt as if a surge of power empowered him.

Lin Yun instantly figured out someone was helping him and took a cold breath.

“Senior, are you the Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng?” Lin Yun asked in an uncertain tone in his mind.

“Looks like you’re not stupid. It’s me, Yu Qingfeng!” That playful voice resounded within Lin Yun’s mind again, making Lin Yun tremble. It was the Sword Emperor who took the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda, the strongest swordsman in the world.

Three thousand years ago, the Sword Emperor was someone who suppressed the entire Sword Sect all by himself with a sword. This instantly made Lin Yun speechless because, from a certain angle, the Sword Emperor should be an enemy as someone who made the Sword Sect fall from a sacred land.

But deep in his heart, he was filled with reverence for the Sword Emperor, so his feelings were complicated. With just one sword in his hand, the Sword Emperor faced the entire Sword Sect all by himself, and just hearing that alone was enough to make anyone’s heart to start boiling.

But the problem was that he had to enter the Sword Sect sooner or later. Senior Brother Feng Jue saved him on the Heavenly Path, which meant that he would become the Sword Sect’s disciple. But it turned out that the Sword Sect had no favorable impression of Yu Qingfeng.

“Are you thinking about why I wanted to level the entire Sword Sect back then?” The Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng seemed to have seen through Lin Yun’s thoughts and chuckled.

“Yeah,” replied Lin Yun.

The Sword Emperor fell into a brief silence before he said, “There’s no need for me to tell you about it. Regardless of whether you’re willing to accept that, you will know about it one day because you’re involved in the karma from three thousand years ago. So I can’t tell you much now, but I can tell you that I have no enmity with the Sword Sect.”

Lin Yun’s face changed because he could tell there was another reason why the Sword Emperor suppressed the Sword Sect back then. But the Sword Emperor also mentioned that he had gotten involved in the karma from three thousand years ago. So what did that exactly mean?

“Is it because of the Great Saint Origin?” Lin Yun probed.

“Haha.” The Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng, merely smiled and changed the topic, “He’s looking at you again.”

His words made Lin Yun’s heart sink. When he raised his head, he saw that Tian Xuanzi was looking at him. But this time, Tian Xuanzi wasn’t in a hurry to make a move and seemed deep in thought. The more Tian Xuanzi was in this state, the more uneasy it made Lin Yun feel.

“So…can we beat this one?” Lin Yun asked with anticipation in his tone. If he could, it would be great. Thinking about how he beat Zhuge Qingyun up and could possibly beat Tian Xuanzi up instantly made his blood boil.

“Uh, there’s no way we can beat this one up.” The Sword Emperor bitterly said. “I’m not in a position to make a move in my current state, and I only promised that I’d look after you. So I have no intention of being involved in something like this. But you might be taken away if the Radiant Sword Saint still doesn’t show up.”

“Senior, since you’ve already helped out, then you might as well help all the way. Help me give Tian Xuanzi a beating,” replied Lin Yun.

“I can’t make a move personally, and your name will spread out since you’ve beaten up Zhuge Qingyun,” smiled the Sword Emperor.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitched because he didn’t think that anyone would believe it. He tried calling the Sword Emperor several times, but the Sword Emperor seemed to be in deep thought and didn’t reply to him.

“Senior, senior…” Lin Yun finally lost his confidence. If the Sword Emperor were no longer around, he would be powerless against Tian Xuanzi, even if Tian Xuanzi was only a clone.

“I wonder which senior you are? Do you mind coming out and letting this junior take a look at you?” Tian Xuanzi asked. He could see Lin Yun didn’t rely on his strength to beat Zhuge Qingyun, but someone was helping him in the dark. Furthermore, the one assisting Lin Yun had reached a terrifying height. But clearly, Yu Qingfeng didn’t bother him, nor did he think about showing up.

“Senior?” When everyone heard what Tian Xuanzi said, they were all shocked. But they soon figured it out because it made no sense that Lin Yun could defeat Zhuge Qingyun. They now knew why Lin Yun could beat Zhuge Qingyun. It turned out that someone was helping Lin Yun, and everything now made sense. If Lin Yun had relied on his ability to defeat Zhuge Qingyun, then they might as well commit suicide immediately.

When Tian Xuanzi stared at Lin Yun, the Sword Emperor also didn’t reply. In the end, Lin Yun could only muster his courage and said, “Tian Xuanzi, since you know that this emperor is here, then why aren’t you backing down right now?”

Emperor? An exclamation resounded from the surroundings because there weren’t many people who could call themselves an ‘Emperor’ in Kunlun Realm.

“Senior, since you’re not willing to show yourself, I must apologize for being rude!” Tian Xuanzi appeared before Lin Yun with his hand stretched over. This time, he had no killing intent and only wanted to take Lin Yun away, unlike the last time.

Lin Yun could keenly sense that this palm was enveloped in a light wind that would nearly tear his body apart.

“Senior!” Lin Yun yelled anxiously in his heart.

“Looks like the rumors are true that the Radiant Sword Saint is in trouble…” said the Sword Emperor calmly. But when he said that, Lin Yun could sense that the pressure on him was lifted, and he quickly jumped to the side.

This surprised Tian Xuanzi as he teleported over and reached out to grab Lin Yun. But Lin Yun could avoid his grasp on the brink of an eye, like a fish in a pond.

Suddenly, the flower on Tian Xuanzi’s shoulder bloomed. When the flower bloomed, Lin Yun could feel that even his breathing had stopped, as if he had plunged into an abyss. In the darkness, a pale white hand broke through and reached over.

“Beat him!” Just when Lin Yun was in despair, the Sword Emperor’s voice resounded, and Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to push his palm out. When the two palms collided, Lin Yun threw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent a few hundred meters away.

“You bluffed me!” Lin Yun said in a depressed tone as he wiped the blood off his lips because he thought that Tian Xuanzi would be sent flying away under that palm.

“Haha,” laughed the Sword Emperor.

“I know who you are now. This junior is surprised that you’ll be involved in this matter,” said Tian Xuanzi after he sent Lin Yun flying out.

“The younger generations are impressive now,” sighed the Sword Emperor in Lin Yun’s mind.

“But since Senior has gotten yourself involved in this matter today, then I can only apologize…” Tian Xuanzi had guessed who was standing behind Lin Yun, but he still showed no intention of letting this matter go. It’s as if he was confident that the Sword Emperor wouldn’t appear publicly.

“Senior, don’t hold back anymore! He’s looking down on you!” Lin Yun said in his heart.

“Do you know why he didn’t call out my name openly? Do you know what it means if I show myself personally?” The Sword Emperor asked. There seemed to be a reason as to why he couldn’t appear publicly. After all, he had a complicated relationship with the Sword Sect, so he shouldn’t be involved in this matter. But since he had taken the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda, he couldn’t watch Lin Yun being captured.

But he was unhappy seeing Tian Xuanzi still coming even after knowing his identity. After a brief silence, the Sword Emperor’s voice resounded in Lin Yun’s mind, “Perhaps it’s because it has been a long time since I made a move personally. Lend me your Flower Burial Sword!”

Hearing that, Lin Yun rejoiced because he knew that if the Sword Emperor swung his sword, Tian Xuanzi would not be able to return.

“Tian Xuanzi, don’t take it too far!” But just when the Sword Emperor was about to make his move, a boundless sword aura exploded from the summit of the snowy mountain. Along with a sword intent that had surpassed firmament sword intent, Jian Jingtian stabbed forth with the Lightning Shadow Sword.

Nine suns appeared behind Jian Jingtian, but this sword was even more dazzling than the nine suns, making Tian Xuanzi’s face thoroughly change. Without any hesitation, Tian Xuanzi immediately retreated, but he was already too late because this sword was too fast.

When the dazzling sword ray stabbed into the painting, a dragon roar echoed from Tian Xuanzi as a Divine Golden Dragon coiled around him. But the Divine Golden Dragon only lasted for a split second before it was torn apart by the sword ray, wanting to eradicate Tian Xuanzi directly.

As the flower on his shoulder dispersed, the petals collided with the sword ray, causing sparks to fly around. But as the petals were sent flying away by the sword ray, the power contained in the sword was swiftly exhausted. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When all the petals were blown away, Tian Xuanzi reached out to grab onto the sword ray with two fingers. As the sword ray unleashed a mighty gale that blew on Tian Xuanzi’s face, causing his face flutter in the wind, traces of blood appeared on Tian Xuanzi’s face.

Meanwhile, everyone in the surroundings was utterly shocked because that was Jian Jingtian, ranked first in the three rankings. Even Tian Xuanzi, known to be invincible in the Ancient Barren Domain, was injured by him, which was simply unbelievable. Jian Jingtian was simply too terrifying because he made a breakthrough in his sword intent under the pressure of Tian Xuanzi, unleashing a sword intent that far exceeded firmament sword intent.

“Tian Xuanzi, you’re a Saint Sovereign. Yet, you made a move against my junior brother time and time again. Do you want any face?!” Jian Jingtian ferociously roared as his voice made the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect tremble.

But when Lin Yun heard that, his face change because Jian Jingtian called him junior brother.

“If you dare to touch him again, I solemnly swear that even if I can’t become a saint and become a demon, I’ll slaughter every person in the Profound Sky Sect!” Jian Jingtian roared with his eyes becoming bloodshot. “I swear that I’ll follow my words!”

But Tian Xuanzi shattered the sword ray and said, “Looks like it was a mistake that I didn’t kill you eighteen years ago.”

“Then don’t make the same mistake again.” Jian Jingtian retorted.

“Hmph!” Tian Xuanzi coldly snorted. “Forget it, then. It’s a threat to leave you behind, so it’s not late for me to kill you now.”

“You bastard, are you really that shameless?!” Lin Yun couldn’t help roaring.

“Why do I need to explain my actions to others?” Since Tian Xuanzi decided to kill, he was instantly enveloped in a terrifying chill.

But right then, the thirty-sixth layer of heaven shattered and a boundless starlight shone down, forming into a white-clothed old man. When Feng Jue saw this old man, he exclaimed, “Master!”
