Chapter 2028 - Lin Yun VS Quasi-Saint

The fight in the arena far exceeded Shi Feng’s expectations. In his view, a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase could easily suppress Ye Qingtian, who was at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

This was because one would step onto the saint path after reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm. Saint aura was on a completely different level than nirvana aura. Even if Quasi-Saints didn’t grasp any saint dao, they could easily use saint aura to kill geniuses at the Nirvana Stage.

To geniuses, it was common to kill those with higher cultivation than them. Their opponents might have an advantage in their cultivation, but the geniuses were blessed with cultivation techniques, talent, aptitude, and inheritance. So wandering cultivators couldn’t be compared to them.

But the saint path was on an entirely different level. So it was practically impossible for geniuses within the top ten of the King Ranking to kill them. On the contrary, it was easy for Quasi-Saints to slay geniuses like them.

Jin Xuanyi was so famous because he had killed a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase. This was also why Shi Feng lost his temper when he saw a Quasi-Saint enter the arena.

Shi Feng was afraid that Ye Qingtian would be killed without being able to pose resistance. But the battle taking place in the arena had left him dumbfounded.

In the arena, Lin Yun calmly faced his opponent with the Divine Firefly Sword, fully unleashing the power of his sword technique that left everyone dumbfounded. It was as though Ye Qingtian was experienced in fighting Quasi-Saints, and he wouldn’t allow his opponent to sneak an attack on him with saint aura.

On the contrary, Lin Yun relied on his profound sword techniques to calmly face his opponent, drawing multiple circles in the arena. Lin Yun alternated between the Dawn Radiance, Sunset Radiance, and Myriad Swords Unite before returning to the Firefly Radiance.

His opponent’s saint aura was powerful, and the shockwave of his attacks left cracks on the arena. But he couldn’t even touch Lin Yun, no matter how he tried.

Lin Yun would draw circles and prevent saint aura from coming close to him and the saint aura would dissipate and land on the arena instead.

The Quasi-Saint wanted to forcibly break through Ye Qingtian’s attacks. He gathered the saint aura into his palm, wanting to shatter Lin Yun’s sword aura. But fireflies bloomed from the circles in the arena. The fireflies might be weak but they could link together and look alive.

When the fireflies bloomed, they resisted the corrosion of the Quasi-Saint’s saint aura. The Quasi-Saint failed to forcibly break through Lin Yun’s attacks, and Lin Yun even took this opportunity to attack.

Lin Yun soared to the sky, leaving behind afterimages while leaving multiple wounds on the Quasi-Saint. Blood splashed on the stage, but they didn’t belong to Ye Qingtian but the Quasi-Saint.

No one expected this scene, regardless of the six holy lands’ geniuses or those from the King Ranking.

“H-How is this possible…?” Qu Duan collapsed with low spirits. He said, “I went into seclusion for two years, but the world is changing too quickly. How is he a genius swordsman in the past five hundred years with that strength?”

Li Yanxian also gulped down a mouthful of saliva and weakly said, “I doubt a genius of his caliber will appear in the next five hundred years… This is unbelievable… Ever since Jian Jingtian appeared, there hasn’t been a genius of a millennium in the Eastern Desolation. But it’s a pity…”

“A pity what?” Qu Duan asked.

Li Yanxian bitterly smiled when he heard that. What else? A pity that this genius wasn’t me!

Eighteen years ago, when Jian Jingtian’s name spread throughout the Eastern Desolation, he suppressed the six holy lands alone, and no geniuses from the six holy lands could raise their heads. He was even famous within the Divine Dragon Empire, but it was a pity that he disappeared like a comet.

Since then, Eastern Desolation’s geniuses have gone into a dark time. Even if there were genius swordsmen, no one dared to claim to be a genius comparable to Jian Jingtian.

Li Yanxian was a swordsman ranked within the top ten on the King Ranking, so he could tell that Ye Qingtian had relied on his sword techniques to suppress that Quasi-Saint, using tricks to resolve brute strength.

Li Yanxian also knew the Divine Firefly Sword technique but had barely reached lesser mastery. However, Ye Qingtian’s version was ten times stronger than his, which was too unbelievable. This was probably the genuine Divine Firefly Sword, the light of the firefly could even compete with moonlight, as the Sword Ancestor said back then.

Who dared to claim that they could fight a Quasi-Saint with a cultivation at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage? This should be what a swordsman looks like. Although Li Yanxian couldn’t go to the arena, he looked forward to reaching Ye Qingtian’s height one day.

“Junior Brother, come down first!” Jiu Yang said with an ugly expression when he saw this scene while fending off Shi Feng. He noticed something wasn’t right, and his junior brother’s mentality was messed up. If the fight continued, his junior brother might even be in danger, which was why he yelled out.

“He’s just a brat! Sun Moon Radiance!” The Quasi-Saint in the arena furiously roared. He didn’t heed what Jiu Yang said, but suddenly retreated to a few hundred meters away before executing the ultimate attack of the Ming Cult. A sun and moon rose to the sky, forming an ancient ‘Ming’ word, enveloping the entire arena.

“Go and die!” The Quasi-Saint roared with his face becoming distorted, controlling the suppressive ‘Ming’ word.

Lin Yun raised his head and knew he couldn’t avoid this attack. He used the Blood Crow Ancestor to temper himself back in the Myriad Graves Valley and knew how to face saint aura. He once suffered from saint aura but wanted to face it head-on this time.

The Flower Burial Sword sensed his thoughts and trembled with fighting spirit. This brought Lin Yun a smile, and he had nothing to ask for to have such a sword to accompany him. “You know me well.”

He recalled the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint's words within the Nether Orchid Courtyard. “Can’t Radiant’s lineage lose once?”

Lin Yun calmly stood in the arena, looking at the descending ancient ‘Ming’ word. His smile disappeared, and he had an answer to that question now. The Radiant’s lineage will never lose!

Lin Yun took a deep breath before taking a step forth. When he stepped forth, he divided into twelve afterimages, each afterimage swinging out a sword. The afterimages lingered, looking like fireflies from afar. But the fireflies soon changed into a bright moon as the afterimages formed a circle.

As he stepped forth, the afterimages returned to him, and the phenomena formed into a firefly’s light that flew out along with his thrust. The other fireflies’ light reflected Lin Yun’s figure, and they flew into his body. When Lin Yun thrust his sword, the entire arena began to tremble as Lin Yun executed the Myriad Swords Unite.

The sword stabbed at the flaw of the ‘Ming’ word, and the word was like a balloon that popped with saint aura gushing out. Blood also dripped down from Lin Yun’s lips, and he was forced to step a hundred meters back. But he had excitement on his face because he had succeeded. The Myriad Swords Unite managed to block an attack from a Quasi-Saint, which felt great.

If the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint saw this scene, she would definitely feel gratified.

“How is this possible?” The Quasi-Saint was shocked as he looked at Ye Qingtian with disbelief.

“I don’t believe that I can’t kill you!” The Quasi-Saint had a hint of insanity within his pupils, with his saint aura boiling. His saint aura formed into an azure energy sphere when he pushed his hands forth, giving off a feeling like a volcano.

The entire arena fell into silence when they saw this scene, and they couldn’t help taking a deep breath with their faces changed. They knew that the Quasi-Saint had brought out his full strength.

It was unbelievable that someone at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage could force a Quasi-Saint to bring out his true strength. From this move, the Quasi-Saint was filled with flaws because he had poured all of his strength into this attack and couldn’t be bothered about anything else.

A violent gale swept the arena as the Quasi-Saint’s aura spread out. This instantly made everyone nervous while looking at the stage because the Quasi-Saint was too shameless. There was no way Ye Qingtian could deal with this attack. He had no choice but to forfeit.

“Wait, he still has a sword…” Li Yanxian muttered. He wasn’t the only one because everyone thought about it as well. But they were curious if Ye Qingtian could unleash his attack while facing a life-and-death crisis. After all, it was a Quasi-Saint that he was facing, and he would die if his attack failed.

But Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to execute the Light of the Beginning. But under the Quasi-Saint’s aura, the Light of the Beginning was slowed this time, enabling everyone to see this sword clearly.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They could see primal chaos being split, with the first glimmer of light appearing. The energy sphere formed by the azure saint aura was severed into two. The Quasi-Saint managed to avoid Ye Qingtian’s sword in time but suffered a horrifying wound to his chest. But he was fortunate that his head was still on his neck.

“Ye Qingtian, what else do you have?” The Quasi-Saint sneered. He was injured, but he was happily laughing. He finally forced Ye Qingtian to bring out that sword. But even that sword couldn’t threaten him, and it was time for him to deal with Ye Qingtian now. He had to teach Ye Qingtian a lesson that Quasi-Saints couldn’t be humiliated.

“Don’t you know that I’m a swordsman?” Lin Yun asked.

“So what if you’re a swordsman?” The Quasi-Saint sneered, feeling confident in this battle.

Lin Yun raised his head and said, “As a swordsman, the battle won’t end if our blood still flows. We also won’t admit defeat, and who told you I have no more trump cards?”

“Mhm?” The Quasi-Saint became suspicious as he noticed Ye Qingtian’s forehead shining brightly with a powerful sword intent spreading out.

When Lin Yun brought out his Astral Sword Intent, fine cracks appeared on the Quasi-Saint’s aura. Lin Yun's sword ray formed a pillar that broke through the clouds. But Lin Yun didn’t give him the opportunity to be shocked and stabbed forth with his sword.

The Quasi-Saint had quickly retreated, but his face was covered in horror when Ye Qingtian brought out his Astral Sword Intent. After all, not even a Saint could grasp the Astral Sword Intent, and it would be weird if he could dodge Ye Qingtian’s attack at such a close distance. With that, Lin Yun’s sword instantly pierced through his chest.

“Stop!” The Quasi-Saint had blood dripping from his lips as he held onto the Flower Burial Sword, looking at Ye Qingtian.

But Lin Yun ignored the Quasi-Saint with his Astral Sword Intent blazing. He injected his Astral Sword Intent into the Quasi-Saint’s body, wreaking havoc within the latter’s body.

The Quasi-Saint was shocked, and discovered he couldn’t stop the Astral Sword Intent from flowing into his body.

“I’m a Quasi-Saint of the Ming Cult! You can’t kill me!” The Quasi-Saint said reluctantly.

“Haven’t you heard a saying before?” Lin Yun raised his voice and continued, “A man has to be firm in his decision, even if he has to mend the heavens!”

Quasi-Saints couldn’t be killed? He would show everyone how he killed a Quasi-Saint today!

Lin Yun stabbed his sword forth as the Quasi-Saint’s body blew apart under the ignition of Astral Sword Intent and was blown into pieces.
