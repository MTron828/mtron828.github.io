Chapter 1088 - Profound Azure Manor, Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect

On the Profound Amber Mountain located in the Profound Amber Realm sat the headquarters of the Sacred Alliance. Most of the geniuses who couldn’t head to the Heavenly Path were here cultivating. They were under the watch of a Sacred Alliance elder.

Suddenly, the token on the waist of the Sacred Alliance’s elder began to shine. When the elder held it, shock appeared on his face and his sword fell onto the ground. It instantly attracted the attention of Bai Lixuan, Nangong Wanyu, and the other geniuses. They were curious what kind of news could make the elder react so strangely.

“There’s an outcome to the Ninth Heavenly Path…” The elder calmed down as joy flashed in his eyes.

“There’s an outcome?” Several people’s hearts sank, especially Bai Lixuan who clenched his right fist.

Nangong Wanyu and the rest soon recovered from their shock and asked, “Was Lin Yun chosen by a sect?”

Since they were cultivating with the Sacred Alliance, they had received news about Kunlun Realm for a while now. So they knew that it would be heaven-defying if someone could be accepted by a powerful sect. Furthermore, it would help them rise in Kulun Realm, which they hoped would happen to Lin Yun.

“He became the champion in the Ninth Heavenly Path and was accepted by an overlord among the various sects, the Sword Sect,” explained the Sacred Alliance’s elder. However, he hid the fact that Lin Yun swept through the ten war realms, killed five Realm Sons, and crippled the others.

The news that the elder hid was the reason why he was so shocked. Sweeping through the war realms was unprecedented, even in the Heavenly Path. It seemed like it wouldn’t take long for Lin Yun to become the greatest legend from the Profound Amber Realm.

“Haha, Lin Yun is really strong!” Mu Han became emotional as excitement filled his eyes. He was just sad that he couldn’t personally witness Lin Yun.

Even Bai Lixuan sighed inwardly because he had expected Lin Yun to shine in the Heavenly Path, but he never expected that Lin Yun would become the champion and get recruited into the Sword Sect.

A long time later after everyone left. Bai Lixuan was the only one who stayed behind. He looked at the elder and said, “Senior, I have made up my mind.”

Unlike the others, he had the Saint Physique. Although his Saint Physique was lacking due to the fact that he was born in the Profound Amber Realm, he could perfect it in the future. As long as he was willing to pay a price, he might have a chance to go to Kunlun Realm.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“The Blood Word Battalion is extremely brutal with a 90% elimination rate. You’ll die if you’re not careful. With your talent, you can actually join other sects to go to Kunlun Realm. There’s no need for you to go this far,” persuaded the elder.

“It’s useless if I can’t join a powerful sect. The Blood Word Battalion is dangerous, but I will also have a chance to reach the peak,” said Bai Lixuan.

“Alright. I’ll let you know half a month from now,” said the elder. The elder knew that Lin Yun becoming the champion had riled up Bai Lixuan’s fighting spirit. So he knew that it was futile no matter how hard he tried to persuade Bai Lixuan. However, the Blood Word Battalion was basically hell. Only madmen would choose to join it, including those from Kunlun Realm.

In the Great Qin Empire, the Sword Firmament Pavilion had become the strongest sect in the entire empire. They even showed signs of becoming the Ancient Southern Domain’s overlord force. After Lin Yun became the champion in the Draconic Banquet, the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s name spread beyond the Great Qin Empire.

At this moment, there were countless people gathered in the palace. There were the guardians, elders, deacons, and core disciples who followed Sect Master Plum.

In front of Sect Master Plum was a token that would show the outcome of the Heavenly Path. Today was the day that the news would come out, so everyone was waiting. Everyone felt nervous because it was common knowledge that the Heavenly Path had a high fatality rate.

Although Lin Yun was dazzling in the Profound Amber Realm, they knew that he might not be able to shine that brightly in the Heavenly Path. If Lin Yun died in the Heavenly Path, then the fortune that the Sword Firmament Sword had enjoyed for the past year would collapse. But if Lin Yun could be chosen by a powerful sect, then the fortune would become even more terrifying.

Sect Master Plum was pretty optimistic about Lin Yun so long as he wasn’t dead. Suddenly, the token shined bright, so he quickly grabbed it. When he was done, he burst into a fit of laughter.

“There was news from the Sacred Alliance?” The elders guessed. “Lin Yun was chosen by a powerful sect?”

“Yeah.” The Pavilion Master Plum stood up and laughed, “He was recruited by the Sword Sect. But not only that, he even became the champion in the Ninth Heavenly Path and swept through everyone!”

The entire sect cheered in disbelief. Lin Yun didn’t die, but he became the champion and joined a powerful sect. It was only natural that everyone celebrated. After all, it was not an outcome that anyone dared to dream about.

“Haha, Lin Yun is really the fortune of our Sword Firmament Pavilion!”

“Champion of the Heavenly Path. We have to forge a statue for Lin Yun!”

“The ancestors have really blessed us. How many years has it been since a genius like him appeared in our Sword Firmament Pavilion!” The elders all had tears of joy rolling down their cheeks.

Only the Pavilion Master Plum maintained his composure. He didn’t expect that Lin Yun would become a legend. All of this was fate, just like how he dared to stand against the entire Great Qin Empire’s royal clan back then to protect Lin Yun.

The Sword Firmament Pavilion didn’t let Lin Yun down. And Lin Yun didn’t let the Sword Firmament Pavilion down. Sect Master Plum wiped away his tears because everything turned out wonderfully.

In Kunlun Realm, a bald monk who had already received the outcome of the Ninth Heavenly Path was drinking wine. He was naturally Drifting Goblet. After learning of the news, Drifting Goblet smiled and drank more wine, “Champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path. He killed five Realm Sons and crippled another five… How terrifying…”

He knew that whatever path Lin Yun was part of wouldn’t be peaceful. But if Su Ziyao knew about it, she would be really happy. At the same time, Li Wuyou also received the news and let out a burst of laughter with joy on his face.

“Hahaha! Big brother is really big brother. Ten Realm Sons? So what! Five are dead and five are crippled, hahaha!” Li Wuyou muttered to himself. “But it’s really unbelievable that the Sword Sect actually went to the Heavenly Path to recruit disciples. Big brother, will you come and look for me? I’ll be waiting for you!”

Kunlun Realm was a place filled with countless legends and experts. At the same time, countless geniuses were either becoming demonic emperors or saint immortals.

“This is Kunlun Realm?” Lin Yun muttered and looked around because it didn’t seem any different from the Profound Amber Realm. However, he could faintly sense a difference.

It wasn’t because of the density of spiritual energy but something else. But even with Lin Yun’s eyesight, he still couldn’t tell what the difference was. On the other hand, Lil’ Red was looking around curiously. Lin Yun had nearly forgotten about Lil’ Red when he left, but everything ended well because Lil’ Red chased after him.

“This is Kunlun Realm!” Feng Jue smiled. It took two days after leaving the Heavenly Path to reach Kunlun Realm. This was without using the transportation array of the Sacred Alliance and Sword Sect’s.

Three days later, a massive ocean appeared before Lin Yun that made him baffled. Truth be told, he could feel that something wasn’t right along the way, but Lin Yun didn’t ask much about it. Four hours later, a massive island appeared before they came to a stop.

“Hmph, Lin Yun, that old fogey lied to you. This is the border of the Eastern Desolation. It’s nowhere near the Ancient Barren Domain. Although I’ve never gone to Sword Sect, he’s definitely not taking you there.” Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded out in Lin Yun’s mind.

“Senior, we’re not going to the Sword Sect, right?” Lin Yun asked.

“Looks like you’re not stupid.” Feng Jue stopped and smiled, “This is the Eastern Desolation’s Profound Azure Manor. The Profound Azure Manor has a total of 36 counties, and a county is equivalent to a domain in the lower realm. The Profound Azure manor has thousands of sects with the King Suspend Palace, Thousand Crane Pavilion, Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and Azure Thunder Monastery taking the lead. We’re heading to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. The instruction of my master was for you to stay there for a year before bringing you to Sword Sect.”

“Senior’s master?” Lin Yun was shocked. Feng Jue was already so strong, so he couldn’t imagine how strong his master was. Did a powerhouse really give instructions regarding me?

“Haha, there’s no need to call me senior. You can just call me Feng Jue or Senior Brother Feng Jue.” Feng Jue smiled before he explained, “Master isn’t making things difficult for you on purpose. He has a reason behind everything.”

“Pray tell, Senior Brother.” Lin Yun took it calmly because he never thought that the Sword Sect was trying to make things difficult for him on purpose. Plus, he only needed to stay for a year.
