Chapter 2356 - Lin Yun’s Choice

“You won’t regret it, right?” Shangguan Jue looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile.

Lin Yun replied, “I won’t regret it. Let’s talk about it if you can still smile later.”

“As expected of you, as arrogant as before,” Shangguan Jue smiled.

“I’m a humble person, and I don’t know how ‘arrogant’ is spelled,” Lin Yun smiled. His words made everyone fall into deep thoughts, with no one believing him. Everyone saw how he dug out seven saint origins before the Deity Slaughter Monument, frightening the other Divine Clans so badly that they didn’t dare look at him. So how was he not arrogant?

Shangguan Jue’s face didn’t change, but this made Zhao Zhanli’s heart clench when he saw Lin Yun’s smile. He said, “Shangguan Jue, why don’t we decrease the bet? The risk is too high to bet all of the treasures from the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron.”

But Shangguan Jue ignored Zhao Zhanli, and said, “Go ahead.”

Lin Yun smiled and wasn’t courteous as he stepped forth. They came before the Profound Sky Venerable with everyone’s attention on the two of them. They already guessed something would happen between them, but they didn’t expect it to be so quick. Not to mention that they even increased the stakes.

“You can go first,” Lin Yun said.

Shangguan Jue replied, “You first.”

“Are you sure about that?” Lin Yun looked at Shangguan Jue with a playful smile.

“That’s for sure. Anyhow, you’ll be the one to lose,” Shangguan Jue said indifferently. He was confident in his Eye of Destiny, and couldn’t think how he would lose.

“It doesn’t matter to me, but I’m afraid that you might not have a chance to perform later,” Lin Yun smiled indifferently.

Shangguan Jue was briefly stunned, before he smiled, “You’re still the arrogant one. But honestly speaking, the higher you climb, the harder you fall. I hope that you can still wear a smile later.”

The two looked at each other with a smile. Seeing this, the grey-robed elder unhappily frowned, “What’s the meaning of competing between yourselves to see who would go first? I have seen many geniuses, and you are nothing before me. It would be heaven-defying if you could obtain three hundred paintings.”

He was unhappy with contempt on his face, and his voice suppressed the surrounding discussions. After all, Profound Sky Venerable definitely met a lot of geniuses in his lifetime with his identity. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Three hundred?” Lin Yun muttered.

The Profound Sky Venerable sneered, “In history, the highest record from Heaven’s Gate is nine hundred. But it would be impressive if the two of you can obtain three hundred.”

The Profound Sky Venerable wasn’t targeting anyone, but the two were nothing before him. Lin Yun was thinking about something else, but his trail of thoughts was disrupted before he could ponder more.

“Brat, you don’t seem to be convinced?” The Profound Sky Venerable said coldly. “Break the record of Heaven’s Gate if you can, and I will eat the entire Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron if you do. What are you two waiting for? Go up together and stop wasting my time!”

His voice was loud and resounding.

Lin Yun felt that Profound Sky Venerable really had a violent temper when he didn’t say anything. Furthermore, the words made Lin Yun and Shangguan Jue feel terrible. They soared to the sky and arrived above the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, before sitting down on it.

Shangguan Jue looked at Lin Yun and sneered in his heart before activating the Eye of Destiny. When the seal was released, he closed his eyes.

When the seal representing the Eye of Destiny flashed, Lin Yun naturally noticed it. Is this Shangguan Jue’s confidence? It should be a secret treasure that merges with the eye since it's giving off a mysterious aura. It is no wonder why Shangguan Jue is so confident.

But Lin Yun soon recollected himself and closed his eyes.

Shangguan Jue came before the vortex of primal chaos, and the mirror shattered when he used the Eye of Destiny with his right eye. Compared to his gentlemanly temperament in the outside world, his eyes viciously flashed here. “Flower Burial, how are you going to compete with me? You can only be trampled by me!”

When the mirror shattered, phenomena began to flash on the mirror fragments, and Shangguan Jue would devour them with a glance. He roared as his right eye began to spiral, “Break!”

A dazzling radiance shone out from his eyes, and he shattered nine mirror fragments in a breath as hundreds of phenomena flew out.

“Keep!” Shangguan Jue snorted as he stored all the phenomena in his right eye. He could feel his mind swelling after simultaneously accepting so many phenomena. He took a deep breath and carried on to the next mirror, where he roared again, “Break!”

But the mirror didn’t shatter this time, only cracks appeared. Shangguan Jue wasn’t surprised, but smiled, “This is getting interesting. I have one-hundred-and-six phenomena now, but it should be easy for me to find three hundred. Profound Sky Venerable said that we can’t find three hundred. I bet he didn’t know that I have the Eye of Destiny and I’m destined to win!”

Shangguan Jue smiled after sorting out his thoughts. After three hundred, he would win whenever he found another one. This brought a smile to Shangguan Jue’s lips. But too much wasn’t good because his Eye of Destiny might be unable to withstand it.

On the other side, Lin Yun also appeared before the vortex of primal chaos and came before a mirror. He took a deep breath and frowned, looking at the mirror. It was just as he had expected, the mirror reflected the primal chaos in his heart. Each layer would allow him to take a clearer look at himself, and the hindrance would also increase.

The first mirror was simple, and Lin Yun could easily shatter the mirror just by focusing a little. He saw the young him in the mirror. He was weak back then but only needed one finger to shatter this mirror.

“The past...” Lin Yun sighed as he was about to tap the mirror, but he stopped just when he was about to come into contact with it. He recalled what Profound Sky Venerable said and held onto his chin. “The geniuses of Heaven’s Gate can only find nine hundred, at best...”

The legacy of the Heaven’s Gate lasted for a few hundred thousand years, but nine hundred was the best? Not to mention that the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity placed a hundred phenomena inside, so what did that mean? That meant that the usual method wouldn’t work.

Shangguan Jue came up with the conclusion that he won, but Lin Yun didn’t even think about winning. He suddenly felt his mind buzzing, and he stepped back, leaving the mirror. “Those people all stopped at nine hundred after relying on their comprehension or treasures...”

He had an uncertain speculation that the mirror was a trap. It was easy to break the first mirror, which most people would break without a second thought. But they would all sink into it, and they could only carry on breaking the mirrors until they reached their limit. Even Lin Yun wouldn’t have thought of that if he didn’t have the Profound Sky Venerable’s reminder.

Lin Yun was excited with his eyes flashing, and retreated to a thousand meters away, where the mirror disappeared. He took a step forth and the mirror reappeared, but it would disappear when he stepped back.

“As I’ve expected.” Lin Yun smiled. He could only reach nine hundred at best if he shattered the mirrors, and the geniuses of Heaven’s Gate had already proven that. But how could he surpass nine hundred? With Nirvana Dao, why would he fear Primal Chaos?

Taking a deep breath, the light shining in his eyes became even more terrifying. He tried it before, but Nirvana Dao couldn’t suppress the primal chaos. So he wanted to give it a try despite knowing that he might fail. If he didn’t give it a try, he wouldn’t know his limit.

While Shangguan Jue was busy shattering mirrors, Lin Yun pushed himself to the limit. He didn’t know if his speculation was correct and didn’t know if he could break apart the primal chaos with his strongest attack.

“This should be a space of consciousness, so I can bring out my true strength. But I can’t bring my Flower Burial Sword over, so I can only rely on myself this time.” Lin Yun’s eyes shone brightly as his heart became firm, looking at the primal chaos.
