Chapter 532 - Trap

Lin Yun had spent five days on the Ablaze Phoenix Painting and he was only left with the phoenix tail. Thinking about it made him admire Mo Ling for her accomplishments. Even if he left the academy now, he wouldn’t suffer a loss. And even though Mo Ling had trapped him, she was still filled with sincerity.

“You’re exaggerating. If it’s something I can do, then there’s no reason for me to refuse,” said Lin Yun. He was curious what the academy needed from him that Mo Ling would even go as far as teaching him personally to trap him.

“There’s no rush.”

“No rush?” Lin Yun was surprised. Mo Ling spent such a great deal of effort to set up this pitfall, but she wasn’t in a rush? But when Lin Yun thought about it, it was more logical for him to be anxious.

“People can make wrong decisions when they’re irrationale. What I’m going to tell you pertains to the life and death of the academy. I hope that you won’t regret it because the responsibility is a lot bigger than you can imagine right now.”

“Wow, it’s that serious?” asked Lin Yun.

“Yes.” Mo Ling nodded her head and she didn’t seem to be joking.

Lin Yun calmed down upon hearing that. He instantly knew that this matter wasn't simple. He then probed with a smile, “You’re not afraid that I won’t agree to it after calming down?”

“In six days, the Profound Yin Lake will be opened and there will be a few Profound Yin Flowers born. The Profound Yin Flower might not be comparable to the Infernal Flower, but it’s extremely suitable for you.”

The Profound Yin Lake? Lin Yun rubbed his chin. The lake was opened every three months, and at that time, spiritual essence would spill out. It was a great event in the academy, especially the competition for the flower.

Mo Ling looked at Lin Yun, “I’ll tell you about it after the flower competition.”

Lin Yun was curious what it was that concerned the academy’s life and death, but he didn’t pursue the matter any longer.

Mo Ling smiled, “Speaking of which, you haven’t been to the Library Hall, right?”

“I want to, but guest deacons aren’t allowed to enter.” The foundation of a quasi-overlord force naturally far exceeded the Sword Firmament Pavilion. He wanted to enter the Library Hall for a long time now, but there was nothing he could do about it.

“Yunyan will take you there tomorrow. You can pick a martial technique you like.”

“Are you serious?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up. With that, his unhappiness for the pitfall that Mo Ling dug for him became faint. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Of course,” she replied.

“Then I’ll have to thank you in advance,” answered Lin Yun happily.

The next morning, Lin Yun saw Liu Yunyan at the Spiritwood Peak. It had been some time since Lin Yun last saw her and she looks more haggard than before. However, her cultivation had clearly improved, pushing her into the greater Yin stage.

“Looks like senior sister has a pretty good impression of you to allow you into the Library Hall,” smiled Liu Yunyan. The two of them were already familiar with each other so she joked with Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was very tempted by the Library Hall. After all, this was the foundation of a quasi-overlord force they were talking about. Even core disciples couldn’t enter easily without completing special missions. The Library Hall even had Heavenly Soul Realm cultivation techniques that were extremely attractive to all disciples.

Lin Yun and Liu Yunyan headed straight to the academy’s core and they stopped beneath a majestic mountain. At the middle of the mountain was a majestic palace that they both soared up to. When they arrived at the palace, they didn’t dare to move despite the fact that there was no one around.

They could clearly sense a gaze on them that probably belonged to an expert that was guarding the Library Hall. If someone dared to look for trouble, they would be sent flying the moment they landed here.

Liu Yunyan only felt relieved when she sensed that the gaze was gone. She smiled, “For a while now, I heard that there is a Heavenly Soul Realm expert guarding this place. It looks like it’s true.”

“This is your first time here?” Lin Yun was surprised.

“Yeah. The academy has other places where we can use contribution points to exchange for techniques. But you can’t enter the Library Hall without a special contribution. Speaking of which, I have you to thank since I can enter the Library Hall.” Liu Yunyan looked at Lin Yun deeply with a complicated view.

“You guys are rather quick. The sky has just lit up.” Laughter sounded out from behind them belonging to Yu Mu.

“Master,” said Liu Yunyan.

“Elder Yu.” Lin Yun and Liu Yunyan bowed. Yu Mu had a high position in the academy and was only second to the Heavenly Soul Realm Tang Yu.

“Hehe, even if you guys are early, there’s nothing you can do if I don’t open the door.” Yu Mu smiled and she instantly appeared before them. Lin Yun couldn’t even see how she moved.

“This movement technique…” Lin Yun was shocked. Her movement technique was a lot stronger than the Seven Profound Steps.

Yu Mu looked at the two with a smile, especially Lin Yun. She nodded her head and said, “Let’s go in.”

The door suddenly lit up as spiritual runes began to appear. Lin Yun took a few glances at it and couldn't believe it, “Interesting...I have a feeling that even a Heavenly Soul Realm expert won’t be able to break through the door so easily.”

This was the terrifying foundation of a quasi-overlord force. After all, the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Martial Hall wasn’t so strict. But when he entered, the scene inside left Lin Yun shocked.

The interior of the hall was empty aside from an ancient array. There weren’t any bookshelves, which was different from what he had imagined. When he looked at Liu Yunyan, he saw that she was also baffled.

“The Library Hall is unlike other places. We use a special method to keep our martial techniques hidden. After all, these are the best of the best, not to mention that we even have lesser abilities,” smiled Yu Mu. “Then again, it won’t be easy to obtain them. If you’re careless, you might even return empty handed.”

“Return empty handed?” Lin Yun was baffled.

Yu Mu nodded his head, “Every technique has a restriction and you have to undergo a test to qualify for it. If you can’t get through the test, then you can’t take the technique away. This place is the essence of the academy’s foundation and only talented disciples are qualified to bring anything out from here. After all, every cultivation technique and martial technique represents the sweat and blood of an ancestor. Some ancestors even gave their lives for it.”

Yu Mu’s face was solemn, but she was also filled with pride. The academy was proud that they could become one of the five quasi-overlord forces.

“So where are the cultivation techniques and marital techniques?” Lin Yun asked.

“There.” Yu Mu pointed at an ancient array, which caused Lin Yun and Liu Yunyan to look at each other before entering.

“After entering the array, you just have to recite what you need in your heart. You can pick anything you want. For example, recite ‘sword technique’ in your heart if you want a sword technique. Then again, don’t regret your decision.” Yu Mu looked at the two and asked, “Any questions?”

“None.” Lin Yun and Liu Yunyan wanted to give it a try, so they naturally wouldn’t ask any questions. Especially Lin Yun because he wanted a replacement for the Dragon-Tiger Fist a long time ago. This was a great opportunity for him.

“Let’s begin then…” Yu Mu formed seals with one hand and activated the array. When the array was activated, a radiance enveloped Lin Yun and Liu Yunyan as they disappeared. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he saw that he was surrounded by darkness and Liu Yunyan was nowhere to be seen.

Lin Yun recited ‘fist technique’ in his heart. In the next second, he saw stars light up the darkness as the radiance from the stars converged into a river that devoured him. Lin Yun could clearly see that each star was a jade slip. The sheer amount of fist techniques was shocking to him.

A long time later, Lin Yun adjusted and saw a jade slip streaking past him like a comet. He reached out and grabbed it. In the next second, boundless information began to pour into his mind.

The Chasing Star Fist, an intermediate earth rank fist technique. This fist technique’s emphasis was on speed, which was rare. Lin Yun was surprised by this technique because it would definitely cause a tremor if it was placed in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. But here, it was something he could easily obtain.

This showed the difference in the two sect’s foundations. But Lin Yun didn’t like this fist technique because it was different from his ferocious style. Loosening his grip on it, the jade slip turned into a comet and flew away.

“Hmmm?” Lin Yun suddenly fell into deep thoughts. Most of the stars were brilliant, but there were also some black stars that looked dead.
