Chapter 422 - Dangerous Straits

The Dragon Blooded Horse’s charge into the Extermination Mountain Range was even more ferocious than Bai Lixuan’s charge. Lin Yun didn’t even have to release his sword aura. The Dragon Blooded Horse’s aura was more than enough to intimidate the demonic beasts in the mountain range.

It was so intimidating that no demonic beasts came after them. Even if they encountered ninth and tenth stage demonic beasts in the depths of the mountain range, the demonic beasts would tremble in fear once they sensed the Dragon Blooded Horse’s aura. In the end, they could only watch as the Dragon Blooded Horse passed through their territory. It was only after the Dragon Blooded Horse left that they would unleash an unwilling roar.

The speed of the Dragon Blooded Horse was so fast that the incoming wind sliced Lin Yun’s face like sharp blades. It made Lin Yun feel as though he was flying on the Dragon Blooded Horse. The speed was much faster than the Seven Profound Steps. Even the Sword Condors were inferior when it came to this speed.

The ground suddenly trembled and a ferocious roar echoed in the forest. This made Lin Yun’s face change because the trees that were in his path were beginning to collapse. It didn’t take long for a Golden Rat to appear before them, standing on its feet.

The Golden Rat was over thirty meters tall, covered with explosive muscles. The golden hair on top of its head was how the rat got its name.

The Golden Rat was emitting an aura in the tenth stage and it stared at Lin Yun and the Dragon Blooded Horse because the two of them had intruded its territory. Coincidentally, the rat happened to be a demonic beast with a violent temper.

With explosive power, the rat brandished its claws that tore through the air. The strength behind it was so powerful that it could even pierce through a ninth stage demonic beast’s defence. One would die a horrible death if they treated this rat as an ordinary rat.

Lin Yun looked up ahead and the core of the Extermination Mountain Range wasn’t far away. Right at this moment, the Golden Rat clenched its claw and swung it at Lin Yun.

“Great!” A smile rose on Lin Yun’s lips and he jumped from the Dragon Blooded Horse. When he balled his fist together, his dracophant energy emitted while saintly music sounded out. Lin Yun had chosen to clash with the Golden Rat head-on with five cauldron’s worth of strength.

The clash between their fists caused an explosion in the air. Lin Yun was tiny in comparison to the rat, but his punch sent the colossal rat backwards.

Right at this moment, a crackle sounded in the air as the Golden Rat swung its tail like a whip towards Lin Yun’s face.

“You’re courting death!” Lin Yun snorted and he grabbed onto the tail. At the same time, he activated the Dracophant Battle Physique, causing his physique to expand in size. With terrifying power, he swung his fist at the rat.

“He’s all yours.” The rat flew away and smashed into the towering trees that were in its trajectory.

The Golden Rat was a formidable beast in the tenth stage, so it was a demonic beast closest to the Violet Palace Realm. However, it was no challenge to Lin Yun. After sending the Golden Rat flying, Lin Yun executed the Seven Profound Steps and disappeared into the forest. He didn’t want to waste more time with the Golden Rat.

When the Golden Rat got back on its feet, it saw the Dragon Blooded Horse chuckling in front of it. Before the rat could even ract, the Dragon Blooded Horse raised its hooves and stomped down. It only took a single move for the Golden Rat to be crushed. The Golden Rat collapsed onto the ground again and wailed out in pain.

Hearing the wail from afar, Lin Yun smiled. Soon, the Golden Rat would realize that it would rather fight Lin Yun than the Dragon Blooded Horse.

As Lin Yun traveled, his face gradually became grave. The core of the Extermination Mountain Range was just up ahead. He wasn’t unfamiliar with this place because he had passed by here when he was heading to the Demonlotus Realm. However, before he even got close, he could sense a chill running down his spine.

There weren’t many demonic beasts at the core and all of them were overlord demonic beasts. After all, Lin Yun had to force himself to the limits if he wanted to unleash all of his potential. Many people thought that he had used up all his trump cards, but in Lin Yun’s view, true experts didn’t need any trump cards to defeat their opponents.

There was still a lot of potential in the Seven Profound Steps, Dragon-Tiger Fist, Dracophant Battle Physique, and the Aquaselenic Sword for him to excavate. Even if he had to include his trump cards, he still had the Great Wind Scripture.

“Drifting Goblet said that there’s no way to comprehend the Heavenly Seal without becoming Buddhist. But my Demon Vanquishing Seal is based on my sword, so there’s a possibility I could figure out another way to graph the Heavenly Seal.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed. If he could succeed in learning the Heavenly Seal, then he would be able to combine the four seals. At that time, his Dragon-Tiger Fist alone would cause the entire Great Qin Empire to tremble. For Lin Yun, he would never know the result if he didn’t give it a try. Armed with a goal, he didn’t hesitate to enter the core of the Extermination Mountain Range.

“What dense spiritual energy!” The core region was truly worthy of being the territory of overlord demonic beasts. The density of the spiritual energy here was even richer than the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

Lin Yun first decided on a direction before he traveled forward. When he finally sensed several horrifying auras, he came to a stop. He was at the intersection of several demonic beasts’ territory.

There were more trees here than other places and the tree branches came in odd shapes. Lin Yun’s face also turned pale because he was also under great pressure when facing the auras head-on.

“This is the spot.” Lin Yun sat down and began to cultivate. He wanted to force himself to comprehend the Heavenly Seal under danger. Then again, he would be torn into pieces by several Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts if he was careless. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As time gradually passed, the four Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts that were nearby had noticed Lin Yun. However, they were cunning. In fact, their intelligence was comparable to humans after reaching the Violet Palace Realm. In their eyes, Lin Yun was food that had delivered himself to their doorsteps.

The vitality in Lin Yun’s flesh was of great nourishment to demonic beasts. It was just like how demonic beast cores were nourishment for human cultivators. However, Lin Yun’s position was ingenious because it was in the intersection of four demonic beasts’ territory. This meant that making the first move would only benefit the other three demonic beasts. Hence, none of them dared to move anytime soon.

Heaven naturally referred to the sky, but in Buddhism, heaven also referred to gods and deities. In Buddhism, heaven had thirty-three heavens. This meant that the Heavenly Seal required Lin Yun to comprehend the profundity of the thirty-three heavens. This was probably the reason why Drifting Goblet said that he couldn’t grasp the Heavenly Seal.

But since he could vanquish demons with his swords, why couldn’t he create a heaven with his sword? Lin Yun was cautious under the immense pressure. He placed himself in a mysterious state as he had to comprehend while staying alert because he might face death at any second.

Killing aura would sweep over occasionally, but what made Lin Yun excited was that he could temper his sword intent with the killing aura. It was beneficial to his sword intent.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. However, for Lin Yun, it felt like years. On a far away tree, a pair of eyes were staring at Lin Yun. Those eyes belonged to Bai Lixuan, whose cultivation had reached the tenth stage. He was genuinely gifted with the Saintly Physique. He was already comparable to the quasi-Violet Palace Realm when he was in the ninth stage, so naturally he was even more powerful now.

“What’s that fellow doing?” Bai Lixuan had been keeping careful watch of Lin Yun ever since the latter stepped into the Extermination Mountain Range. He initially thought that Lin Yun was stupid to camp in the intersection between four demonic beasts’ territory, but he never imagined that Lin Yun would be fine after three days.

“Could it be…” Bai Lixuan’s jaw dropped out of shock. He was talented, so he naturally guessed the reason why Lin Yun was doing this.

There was nothing he could say about Lin Yun’s guts to force out potential in the face of danger. But shortly after, a cold smirk rose on Bai Lixuan’s lips because Lin Yun was courting death in his eyes. Just thinking about the danger of this method alone sent a chill straight to Bai Lixuan’s heart.

The demonic beasts were restricting each other, which was why none of them dared to move. But the moment they lost their patience would signify the moment of Lin Yun’s death. In the worst case scenario, Lin Yun would face the attacks from four demonic beasts at the same time.

Bai Lixuan was comparable to Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts, but even he couldn’t face four demonic beasts at the same time. He dared to train himself in the core of the Extermination Mountain Range, but he didn’t have Lin Yun’s guts to put himself in danger just to squeeze out his potential.

“Let me see how you die then!” Bai Lixuan harrumphed at Lin Yun because he thought the latter was a dead man walking.
