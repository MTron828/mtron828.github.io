Chapter 785 - Pressing Forth

Lin Yun only used three swords to defeat Ye Qingfeng who was in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. Furthermore, he only used the xiantian sword intent in greater mastery, giving others the feeling that he was still holding back.

The judge of Lin Yun’s fight was a little distracted after Ye Qingfeng was defeated. Everyone had seen how strong Lin Yun was and no one thought of him as a weakling. So much so that in the hearts of many people, he was guaranteed to make the top thirty and maybe even the top fifteen.

The top ten wasn’t as probable since the three kings and seven elites were too terrifying. However, it was still a legendary achievement if someone was ranked in the top fifteen. Most importantly, Lin Yun was only eighteen. He went from being underestimated to defeating Ye Qingfeng in three swords. The judge couldn’t wrap his mind around what he just saw.

Even some of the spectators doubted the outcome. They all thought that Lin Yun would lose the fight due to the huge difference in their cultivation, but that’s not what happened.

If it was the Northern Snow Manor’s Nangong Wanyu or Heavenly Sword Sect’s Li Mubai who defeated Ye Qingfeng in three swords, they wouldn’t be so shocked. But Lin Yun was different because he was a newly risen genius. His cultivation wasn’t high and he was from the small Great Qin Empire. There was no way the Great Qin Empire could be compared to the nine overlord forces.

Even more mind-blowing was the fact that Lin Yun did it easily and showed no signs of giving it his all.

“Unbelievable!”

“Three swords. His xiantian sword intent is certainly beyond greater mastery. Just how many trump cards does Lin Yun still have?”

“I suspect that he might have a chance to make it into the top ten.” The geniuses who were sitting had shock written on their faces. Ye Qingfeng was unlike those Lin Yun had defeated previously because he was a genius in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. His cultivation was comparable to the seven elites.

“It’s hard to guarantee that anyone can defeat him if they’re not one of the three kings and seven elites.” Feng Wudao sighed helplessly. Out of the fourth and seventh groups, three experts hadn’t fought Lin Yun yet. Jue Chen and Ji Feng hadn’t fought Lin Yun, but they were part of the seven elites, so their strength wasn’t questioned.

The last expert was Yan Ziqing who was ranked fourteenth on the Dragoncloud Ranking. His strength was roughly the same as Wu Xiaotian, but he couldn’t compare to Lin Yun in terms of popularity.

Initially, Feng Wudao felt that Lin Yun would lose if he ran into Yan Ziqing. But now, he actually thought that Lin Yun had a 40% chance of winning. As for Fang Hanluo, the uncertainty was as high.

Seated with the Heavenly Demon Pavilion, Yan Long’zi was currently wearing an ugly facial expression. Lin Yun made him eat his words. His eyes flashed coldly and he spoke, “That fellow does have some ability. But it’s impossible for him to make it into the top ten.”

Yue Weiwei didn’t pay any attention to him and looked at Lin Yun gently. She knew that her Big Brother Yun had gotten a lot stronger. She still remembered how Lin Yun saved her from Bai Lixuan amid the danger and how he even faced Situ Yi’s pursuit. In the end, he would rather jump into the Yin Wind Stream than hand her over.

She never expected that he would rise so quickly in just two years. As she recalled what happened back in the Yin Wind Stream, she couldn't help smiling.

When Lin Yun returned to his seat, the profound amber aura in his jade token was dazzling like a star. Enveloped by the radiance, Lin Yun looked exceptionally sacred.

The Northern Snow Manor’s Nangong Wanyu and the Heavenly Sword Sect’s Li Mubai both exchanged a glance. They knew that the number of swordsmen they had to pay attention to in this banquet had increased by one.

Time passed and it was eventually Lin Yun’s turn again. However, Lin Yun’s opponent admitted defeat the moment he was called upon. With that, there were only three battles left for each person. At this critical moment, no one tried to force themselves in an impossible battle.

It didn’t take long for Feng Wudao and Ye Qingfeng to run into each other. They were both defeated by Lin Yun. Initially, Ye Qingfeng was slightly stronger, but he was heavily injured by Lin Yun. So his advantage as a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm was no longer as obvious.

The moment the fight started, Ye Qingfeng tried to use his advantage to end the battle quickly. But Feng Wudao merely smiled and chose to avoid Ye Qingfeng’s attack, which was unlike his usual self.

“Mountainshattering Claw!” Ye Qingfeng’s killing aura exploded as his claw manifested into a gigantic beast claw that could easily shatter a mountain. This caught Feng Wudao by surprise and left a sinister wound on his chest.

“Let me see how long you can be arrogant for!” Feng Wudao’s eyes flashed ruthlessly as he avoided Ye Qingfeng’s attacks. He might be retreating, but he was also counterattacking to prevent Ye Qingfeng from obtaining a bigger advantage.

The two continued to fight on the stage, but everyone could tell that Ye Qingfeng held the advantage.

“Keep dodging! I want to see how long you can keep this up! Threesolute Heart Shattering Claw!” Ye Qingfeng finally lost his patience and unleashed his strongest attack that he also used on Lin Yun. But this time, it was no longer as powerful because of his injuries.

“I’ve been waiting for this.” Feng Wudao sneered and instantly unleashed his lightning intent, causing the sky to be enveloped with thunderclouds. With one attack, Feng Wudao shattered Ye Qingfeng’s attack. This made Ye Qingfeng throw up a mouthful of blood before he fell to the edge of the stage, nearly falling off the stage.

“Thanks for the win.” Feng Wudao smiled.

“We’ll meet again in the third round.” Ye Qingfeng’s eyes flickered. He had something to say, but he ultimately held his tongue. The result was already determined, so there was no point in making an excuse. All he could do was win back in the third round.

“I’ll wait for you.” Feng Wudao snickered. He wasn’t afraid of Ye Qingfeng.

With the elimination round coming to an end, the battles got even more brutal as no one could back anymore if they wanted to make it into the top one hundred.

Lin Yun was also paying attention to the other stages. Wu Xiaotian still maintained his strong stance. On the other hand, Ji Wuye had lost two rounds. If he was unlucky to run into one of the three kings and seven elites, his journey would come to an end.

As for Bai Lixuan, he unluckily ran into Nangong Wanyu and he admitted defeat decisively. With that, his winning streak had come to an end. But with his strength, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to make it into the third round. Furthermore, he still hadn’t brought out the Azure Dragon Sword Technique in its entirety.

Lin Yun also had a feeling that Bai Lixuan was still holding back his trump cards, which showed Bai Lixuan’s ambition. When Bai Lixuan ended his latest match, he looked at Lin Yun and nodded his head as a greeting.

“Looks like it shouldn’t be a problem for Lin Yun and Bai Lixuan to get into the ranking battle, especially Lin Yun. I can tell that he hasn’t used all his strength. If this carries on, he should be able to make it into the top fifteen,” said the sect elders to Pavilion Master Plum.

Pavilion Master Plum smiled when he heard this as he had deep feelings for Lin Yun and Bai Lixuan. Now that the two of them were shining brightly in the Draconic Banquet, he was naturally feeling emotional.

Who could’ve imagined that two disciples who came from the Great Qin Empire would shine so brightly in the Draconic Banquet. After the banquet, there was a high possibility that the Sword Firmament Pavilion could expand beyond the Great Qin Empire.

Very quickly, the eighth and ninth rounds of the elimination round came to an end. Each person only had one more opponent to fight. Everything was pretty much determined, but no one dared to relax during the last battle. Even those who could make it into the third round didn’t want to lose their last match as their profound amber aura was important.

Up till now, only a few aside from the three kings and seven elites maintained their winning streak. These individuals were Lin Yun, Wu Xiaotian, Yan Ziqing, and Zhu Qingshan. As for Yue Weiwei, she unfortunately ran into the Cloud Trigram Sect’s Jiang Ziye. Everyone was excited for this battle, but Yue Weiwei admitted defeat with a smile.

This had exceeded everyone's expectations because Yue Weiwei was too mysterious. The crowd even thought that she could fight Jiang Ziye.

Of the four, Wu Xiaotian and Yan Ziqing were ranked from the previous banquet. So it wasn’t surprising that they could maintain their winning streak if they didn’t run into the three kings and seven elites. As for Lin Yun and Zhu Qingshan, they were dark horses that left a deep impression on everyone.

But compared to Lin Yun, Zhu Qingshan was brutal and slayed many participants. Many people felt that he must have cultivated a demonic cultivation technique. They even suspected that he might be a demonic cultivator, which is why he wore a black robe to conceal himself.

“Last match, Lin Yun VS Ji Feng!” A commotion rang out the moment the judge announced the next fight. It was truly a shocking matchup.

“How unexpected. Lin Yun actually ran into Ji Feng in his last battle.”

“I thought that Lin Yun would maintain his winning streak. This isn’t good. The dark horses have admitted defeat whenever they ran into the three kings and seven elites to preserve their strength.”

“Indeed, this is ultimately just the elimination round and not the ranking battle.”

“I wonder if Ji Feng will give Lin Yun the chance to end the fight in a single move like he did with Jue Chen. Otherwise, the odds of Lin Yun losing are high.” Many people sighed at Lin Yun’s misfortune.

Ji Feng didn’t move because all of his opponents so far had admitted defeat. Lin Yun wouldn’t be the exception. After all, the three kings and seven elites’ reputation was too strong.

Many people looked at Lin Yun, waiting for his decision. Bai Lixuan, Ji Wuye, Wu Xiaotian, Nangong Wanyu, Li Mubai, and many other geniuses looked at Lin Yun curiously.

Under everyone’s gaze, the Flower Burial Sword began to hum from within its sheath. The heart of a swordsman wouldn’t allow him to cower. Holding onto the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun ascended to the stage without any hesitation.
