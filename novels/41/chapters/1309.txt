Chapter 1310 - You're A Phoenix

The Serene Night was one of the ten ancient flowers. Its fragrance could drag others into an illusion, and it could also devour flesh and blood to grow. This meant that it could live on others like a parasite. At the same time, the flowerbud possessed a form of the sacred flame.

Lin Yun ran into it when he entered the Profound Wither Island, but it had just started growing the first he met it, and it made Lin Yun flee because of how troublesome it was. As for those who tried to obtain the Serene Night, they were all devoured by it, instead.

Lin Yun had a deep impression of it because there were at least hundreds of people who were devoured by the Serene Night, and all it spat out were piles of bones. Back then, he had already guessed that it might possess an origin saint rune, and that was why he fled, since it was too troublesome.

“Looks like it has left an eye on me…” Lin Yun muttered with a playful smile. At the same time, Lil’ Purple broke free from Lin Yun and returned to standing on the Snow Heed Blade.

“Empress, I was the one who saved you!” Lin Yun smiled while winking his eye at Lil’ Purple.

“Hmph, who needs your saving. It’s just a flower. This empress previously didn’t know about it. If I knew, I could’ve easily dealt with it!” Lil’ Purple pouted unhappily.

“I heard someone crying earlier when I was drawing my constellation. Was it you?” Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple with a smile.

“W-W-Who cried!?” Lil’ Purple refused with her face blushing.

Squinting his eyes together, Lin Yun smiled, “Maybe I heard it wrongly, then. That sparrow’s voice just sounded like a phoenix. Well, now that I looked at it again, how can there be a phoenix cry for me.”

“Who are you calling a sparrow!” Lil’ Purple furiously glared at Lin Yun. “I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths. I’m not a sparrow!”

“So you’re admitting that you cried earlier?” Lin Yun smiled gently.

“T-T-This empress…” Lil’ Purple bit on her lips with her eyes turning red. But as all her emotions surged up, she began to sob.

“Don’t cry in the future. After all, you’re a phoenix!” Lin Yun smiled while he caressed Lil’ Purple’s head.

“Okay.” Lil’ Purple nodded her head.

Right at this moment, in the region were the grey-clothed old man exploded, a dazzling light shone and all the dust was swept away. When the cloud of dust disappeared, what appeared was a gigantic flower with a blurred humanoid figure at the bud of the flower. Her skin was blue with runes that covered her entire body.

Her blue face was bewitching, and her pupils were blazing with green flames. As she slowly moved, her legs began to appear on the flowerbud. This made Lin Yun surprised because the Serene Night could only manifest her upper body in the beginning.

He didn’t expect that it would actually manage to manifest her lower body in just one month. It appeared that while she pursued him over the past month, she must’ve devoured a lot of Elysium Core Realm experts in the process.

Her sharp nails were placed by her lips. As she licked her nails, she revealed a bewitching smile. “Looks like you’ve gotten even stronger. Why don’t you become my host? I guarantee that I can give you endless happiness!”

Her voice was bewitching, but when Lil’ Purple heard what she said, her face turned black, and glared at Lin Yun. “What a bitch. You’re not allowed to look at her!”

Her words made the corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitch because he had no idea what was in her mind. He knew the Serene Night was a human-eating monster, and he wouldn’t dare to touch her even if he had a hundred guts. Furthermore, his taste in women also wasn’t so terrible.

“What a pitiful ice phoenix, you even lost your divine blood.” Standing on the flower, the Serene Night revealed a bewitching smile before she shook her head. “What a pity. I can’t even bear to eat you. Tsk, tsk, tsk.”

“Hmph, you do have any idea how much this empress has crushed garbage like you in the past? And yet, you want to eat this empress?” Lil’ Purple coldly said. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What about now, then? Hahaha!” The Serene Night laughed before raising both of her hands, unleashing countless vines that headed towards Lil’ Purple in the form of tentacles.

But Lin Yun stood before Lil’ Purple and reached out, allowing the vines to tangle around his arm.

“I know your name. You’re called Lin Yun, right? I like that name of yours!” The Serene Night winked and gave Lin Yun a smile. When she laughed, an aromatic fragrance began to spread out that could drag others into an illusion.

But Lin Yun wasn’t even bothered by it because it was futile against his firmament sword intent.

“Well, I have another name that you might not like.” Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art along with all the accumulated astral energy within his body to confront the vines. It might seem easy, but they were competing amongst themselves, since the Serene Night wanted to pull Lin Yun over to devour him.

On the other hand, Lin Yun wanted to snap those vines. Those vines might seem weak, but their toughness was comparable to saint artifacts. He hadn’t seen it for a month, and the Serene Night had gotten a lot stronger.

“So what’s that name? Why don’t you tell me? I’ll love everything about you!” The Serene Night smiled. As she spoke, she even licked her lips while looking at Lin Yun. If it was someone else, they would’ve probably fallen under her illusion.

“Flower Burial,” smiled Lin Yun.

When the Serene Night heard that, her face changed and became cold. “Then, let me bury you!”

Green flames began to blaze on the vines, emitting an eerie yet sacred aura. When Lil’ Purple saw that, she quickly remembered, “This garbage herb actually gave birth to sacred flames!”

“Empress, go and take a look at Lil’ Red. I’ll play with her,” smiled Lin Yun without any panic on his face. A lot of Lil’ Red’s vitality had been devoured, and it had been hugging its head in pain.

“Okay.” Lil’ Red quickly flew and left the region enveloped in the illusion. After she left, the sacred flames on the vines spread to Lin Yun’s palm, instantly spreading throughout his body.

“Have a taste of my flames, hehe.” The Serene Night said with a wink.

“Well, it’s not bad.” Lin Yun smiled while allowing the green flames to envelop his body. When Serene Night saw this scene, she squinted her eyes and couldn’t believe that her sacred flame did nothing to him.

But before the Serene Night could respond, a draconic roar echoed from within Lin Yun’s body and his cultivation instantly reached the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm. At the same time, the accumulated astral energy within his body swept out and ten-odd vines were torn apart with a tug.

When all the vines snapped, the sacred flames also flew about. This made Serene Night let out a groan while she took several steps back on the flower petal.

“Let’s fight, then!” Lin Yun’s eyes coldly flashed as he smirked, while a pair of golden wings unfolded behind him. In the next second, he had already appeared on the flower, standing before the Serene Night.

“You’re courting death!” The Serene Night’s face became sinister and she raised her hand with a palm heading towards Lin Yun. Even without her host, she was strong, to begin with. So her palm was enveloped in a sacred light and all the runes on the surface of her body began to glow.

As the surrounding space began to tremble, the first layer of the thirty-six layers of heaven broke. Facing her attack, Lin Yun also raised his hand with his palm pushing out.

As astral energy began to surge on Lin Yun’s palm, the boundless light radiating from his palm made the attack unleashed by the Serene Night seem dim in comparison. But Lin Yun didn’t let her go and continued to clash head-on.

Lin Yun let out a roar after ten-odd clashes and a golden crow and silver phoenix flew from his body when he threw out his next punch. His attack made the Serene Night fly back by a few hundred meters and she threw out a mouthful of green blood.

“How is this possible?!” The Serene Night squinted her eyes. Lin Yun’s cultivation was clearly only at the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm, but the astral energy emitted from Lin Yun was even stronger than Elysium Core Realm experts.

With a single thought, the Serene Night’s petals began to fly about like butterflies. At the same time, the flower bud was emitting a green light that looked extremely evil, to which Lin Yun could sense his vitality being sapped from his body.

This was a bizarre form of attack, and not even his sword intent could stop his vitality from being sapped. All his sword intent could do was merely to slow it down.

Looking at this scene, the Serene Night smiled sinisterly and her injuries were recovering at a visible speed. She was tasting the true dragon’s vitality from Lin Yun, and the more she tasted, the more she was satisfied with Lin Yun’s body.

“Is this all you got? How disappointing!” Lin Yun stomped his foot and all the astral energy within his body began to blaze like a dazzling sun. He also began to emit a golden light, causing the colossal flower to tremble and the petals to fly and shatter into pieces.

“You think you can devour all of my vitality?” Lin Yun wore a playful smile.

His words made Serene Night’s face ugly. Lin Yun’s vitality was like a boundless ocean. Even if he didn’t resist, she knew that she couldn’t devour all of Lin Yun’s vitality even if she had three days and three nights, not to mention that her illusion was useless before Lin Yun. So this meant that half of her tricks were rendered invalid.

“You should have an origin saint rune, right?” Lin Yun looked at Serene Night with her hair violently fluttering in the wind. He was already being benevolent for not going after the Serene Night before. But the Serene Night was courting death since she dare to show up before him.

But fortunately, his Flower Burial Sword needed an origin saint rune to be upgraded to a saint artifact. The Serene Night wanted to use him as a host? Then he would use her to upgrade his weapon! Lin Yun was prideful, and when his aura pressed down on her, it made Serene Night feel suffocating.

“You forced me to do this!” Serene Night roared and the green flames blazing in her pupils became even more ferocious. At the same time, boundless sacred flames poured from her body and instantly formed into a sea of flames.
