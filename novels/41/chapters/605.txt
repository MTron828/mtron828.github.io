Chapter 606 - Trial in the Empyrean’s Tomb

“We’re fortunate that the seal dissipated.” Zhang Yuan was covered in sweat as he had no confidence in facing Ji Wuye. It felt as though he had barely missed the gates to hell.

“Ji Wuye might be brutal, but he has the strength to back it up.”

“Not many people can have such a refined killing aura.” The other Heavenly Sword Sect’s disciples also gasped for their breath.

“Thanks for that, Senior Sister Mo Ling.” Among the group, Lin Yun was undoubtedly the calmest. Even without the Seven Slaughtering Seal, he could also face Ji Wuye’s killing aura with his xiantian sword intent.

“It’s fine. But don’t be so impulsive in the future. Ji Wuye had been ganged up on by several experts in the previous Draconic Banquet and he survived it. Four years have passed, so he’s only stronger,” said Mo Ling with a grave expression.

Lin Yun wanted to say something, but he knew that Mo Ling was worried about him, so he didn’t say a word. Ji Wuye might not have brought out his full strength, but it was the same for Lin Yun. If they really fought, Lin Yun had at least a 40% chance of winning. Since Ji Wuye treated him as a pushover, then he naturally wouldn’t take it lying down.

“I’m sorry. I was the cause of this,” said Mu Chen. He couldn’t help feeling ashamed thinking about his performance earlier. If Lin Yun didn’t help him, he would have gotten down on his knees publicly.

“I’m the one who killed his junior brother, so I naturally have to stand out.”

“But you did it to save me…”

“The reason doesn’t matter. I killed him knowing that he’s Ji Wuye’s junior brother,” said Lin Yun calmly as he continued, “Let’s go. We’re already falling behind.”

“We don’t need to be in a rush. I’m guessing that there’s a trial we have to take in order to enter. Otherwise, the seal wouldn’t dissipate if the deceased empyrean didn’t wish to be bothered. Since it has dissipated, this means that there must be a trial he left behind,” said Zhang Yuan. His words made sense because all cultivators wished for their legacy to be passed down.

After all, who would be willing to see their martial techniques go down the drain?

With the seal dissipating, the quiet barren had exploded as countless people pounced at the empyrean’s tomb. Meanwhile, Lin Yun’s group traveled at their own pace as they weren’t in a hurry.

A moment later, a majestic door appeared before everyone on a sand dune. Along with the seal breaking, the door had already been opened with countless people entering. But the moment they entered, their aura had completely disappeared. It appears that the world inside the empyrean’s tomb was an isolated space.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts as it appeared that Zhang Yuan was right. The empyrean’s tomb was different from other underground palaces and it wouldn’t be easy getting anything from there.

Right at this moment, ripples began to appear in the space outside the empyrean’s tomb. Whenever a fluctuation appeared, everyone could vaguely see a figure being transported elsewhere.

“They are probably the people who failed the trial. It looks like we can only depend on ourselves in the empyrean’s tomb,” sighed Zhang Yuan with disappointment in his eyes. He wanted to rely on Lin Yun after witnessing Lin Yun’s strength. After all, Lin Yun was someone who even dared to face Ji Wuye. But it looks like his hope has gone down the drain.

“Let’s go,” said Mo Ling as she walked over. It didn’t take long for the group to enter the gate.

The moment they entered, their vision went black. Not long later, a dazzling brightness appeared before them that forced them to close their eyes. When the radiance gradually faded, Lin Yun realized that there was no one around him.

“Looks like we were transported to different places…” Lin Yun muttered. But judging from the spatial fluctuations, the failures should be transported out, so Mo Ling and the rest shouldn’t be in danger.

When Lin Yun looked up ahead, he could see a passage up ahead. When he got closer, Lin Yun found a puppet donned in armor. The puppet wielded a long spear and gradually approached him.

“Stop right there,” said the puppet. Lin Yun immediately came to stop as he looked at the puppet.

“The tomb has nine levels and each level has a test. You’re only qualified to search for master’s legacy after passing the test. Master has left behind his martial techniques and Astral Pearl on the ninth level. If you want to compete for it, then continue your path,” said the puppet without any emotions in his voice.

Lin Yun could tell that this puppet was one with intelligence, and it had recovered some of that. Lin Yun looked at it, and he asked, “Are you the first test?”

“I am.” The puppet stepped forward and stabbed out the spear in his hand unleashing its aura in the greater Yang stage. Lin Yun could instantly sense that the puppet had a higher cultivation than him that wasn’t any inferior to the likes of Zhang Yuan. But it should be stronger in terms of defences.

However, the puppet was ultimately not a living being. In the blink of an eye, the puppet stabbed out several times aiming for Lin Yun’s fatal spots. Facing those attacks, Lin Yun was forced to take several steps back.

But when there was no more space to retreat, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly, “If I can only pass through by defeating you, then this is the end.”

Finding the flaw in the puppet’s spear technique, Lin Yun reached out and grabbed the long spear. The long spear began to tremble, and no matter what the puppet did, it wasn’t able to pull its spear out from Lin Yun’s grip.

“This isn’t all my strength,” said Lin Yun as the dracophant energy spread throughout his body and he snatched the spear from the puppet. Then stabbed at it and yelled, “Get down!”

The spear bolted out and left a huge hole on the puppet’s chest. The puppet’s armor might seem tough, but it was nothing after the spear was empowered by his xiantian sword intent in greater mastery. With that, the puppet dropped down to its knees before collapsing on the ground.

“Doesn’t seem difficult at all,” muttered Lin Yun as he examined the spear and nodded his head. This spear could be considered an ancient weapon. Since he couldn’t use the Flower Burial Sword for now, then he could make do with this spear.

Grabbing onto the spear, Lin Yun pressed forward without turning back. There was no challenge in this test to Lin Yun, but many people were crying out bitterly because of it. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Damn it, isn’t the defence a little too terrifying?”

“It has a higher cultivation than me!”

“Do I really not have the qualification to enter the tomb at all?”

Many people failed to get through the test. The test was nothing to those geniuses on the ranking, but the majority of the people were fighting bitterly just for the first trial. By the time the first trial came to an end, nearly half of the people had been eliminated.

At the border of the Withernorth Sea, those who failed the trial were transported out directly.

“The seal to the empyrean’s tomb has broken?”

“It appears that the trial has begun…”

“So there’s really a trial in the empyrean’s tomb. This means that those who aren’t strong enough won’t be able to get anything in there.”

“I wonder who will be the last one laughing. After all, you can only rely on your own strength in the empyrean’s tomb.”

“Is there a need to discuss that? It will naturally be those ranked in the top ten on the outer ranking.”

Looking at those who failed the trial, the elders who had been waiting outside all became energetic. They roughly had an idea of what was going on with a single glance.

After Lin Yun got through the first test, he began his search in the tomb, but was disappointed. There was nothing special in the first level aside from some ordinary pellets. Those pellets might be precious to others, but they were worthless to him.

Without wasting a second, Lin Yun headed to the second level directly. When he was on the second level, two silver puppets appeared before him once more. Their cultivation was still higher than his and their armor was clearly more refined as there were even ancient spiritual runes glowing on it.

“This is difficult now…” Lin Yun could instantly tell that the armor was a cosmic artifact. If the second trial was already so difficult, Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how difficult the trial on the ninth level would be.
