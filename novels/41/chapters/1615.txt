Chapter 1616 - You Guys Aren’t The Only Ones

Lin Yun rode on the Azure Dragon to chase after Chen Tao. This scene shocked many people because no one expected Lin Yun would show such a strong stance. Not to mention that he was chasing after Chen Tao now. Was this the power of the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple?

Everyone was deeply shocked because Lin Yun was only at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, while Chen Tao was at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

“Isn’t it a little too terrifying? The Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple is rather terrifying…”

“I initially thought he was boasting. But he’s really arrogant now!”

“What he said isn’t wrong. If Lin Yun were Tian Xuanzi’s disciple, those three wouldn’t dare to be so arrogant.”

“Isn’t that bullshit? Who doesn’t know that the Radiant Sword Saint doesn’t have long to live? Lin Yun is furious because of his master this time!” Everyone on the mountain could feel their blood boiling.

“You’re asking to be humiliated!” Chen Tao threw out a mouthful of blood with his face dark and raged, “The Radiant Sword Saint is nothing in my eyes, and I will make you kneel today!”

In the blink of an eye, Chen Tao and Lin Yun exchanged ten-odd moves in mid-air. Flames radiated while fluctuating with boundless dragon origin, and the draconic roar made everyone’s internal organs tremble. Another ten moves later, a person was sent flying away.

“Is this the best you can do? The chief disciple of the Emerald Jade Manor is too disappointing. I’ve yet to warm up.” Lin Yun sneered while standing on the Azure Dragon, and his words made Chen Tao’s face ugly.

“When are you two planning to stop watching? Don’t you guys want the Sovereign Saint Sword?” Lin Yun coldly looked at Xiao Kui and Xuan Feng, who had sealed his path. With a wave of his hand, he summoned the Flower Burial Sword from his sword box. When the sword fell into his hand, the sword began to vibrate.

“Today, I’ll let you guys know why only I am qualified to hold the Sovereign Saint Sword!” Lin Yun didn’t waste time talking and charged at the three. This time, he even used his Divine Sunchasing Art, leaving faint ripples in the surrounding space.

Xiao Kui was shocked by Lin Yun’s speed as a smear of golden light appeared behind him. He didn’t hesitate to draw his blade and swung it. “What speed!”

“What the hell?” When the sword and blade collided, Xiao Kui could feel his palm becoming numb, and he took several steps back. He nearly lost grip of his blade, surprising Xiao Kui. After all, there was a massive gap in their cultivations, so how could Lin Yun make him retreat?

As Lin Yun retreated, a black Netherflower flew from his body. The forty-eight petals manifested into a sword ocean shrouded in nether energy, and the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron within his body began to rumble.

With the Netherflower and cauldron empowering him, Lin Yun’s dragon origin wasn’t at all inferior to those three. Standing in the black ocean, Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind, his sword intent going berserk, making him look like a demonic god.

Turning back, Lin Yun executed the Heaven Sword Form, and the power of this sword made Xuan Feng take several steps back with his face drastically changing. Since Lin Yun’s sword aura was shrouding his sword, it easily corroded the crimson aura enveloping Xiao Kui’s blade.

“Divine Firmament Sword Sutra?” Xiao Kui responded and looked at his blade. He noticed that the crimson light enveloping his blade had become dim.

This was because nether energy could erode everything, phenomena, intents, and even dragon origin. Not many people could practice the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, and not many could reach the same level as Lin Yun. After all, even Jian Jingtian didn’t practice the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra back then.

After the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra reached the sixth stage, the erosion ability was strengthened. This was why Xiao Kui had some trouble, even if his cultivation was higher. More accurately, it wasn’t erosion but death, the absorption and destruction of life. It only looked like erosion and looked similar in terms of nature.

As the light enveloping Lin Yun exploded, he pushed his sword intent to quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, making him look like a death god and clashed with Xiao Kui once more. Not long later, Xiao Kui’s crimson blade aura was devoured by Lin Yun’s black sword aura.

“How is this possible?” Xiao Kui began to feel afraid because this could no longer be explained as the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. Lin Yun’s sword intent was stronger than his blade intent, so he gradually fell into a disadvantageous position. Could it be that Lin Yun had reached the threshold of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent? Wasn’t this a little too terrifying?

When Xiao Kui executed the Heavenly Origin Blade Technique, wanting to break open Lin Yun’s sword aura, Lin Yun snorted, distorting the surrounding space. Before swinging his sword, he avoided Xuan Feng and Chen Tao’s attacks. This time, Xiao Kui was sent flying away while throwing out a mouthful of blood.

“I’m injured?” Xiao Kui’s lips twitched with disbelief on his face.

“Die!” Chen Tao charged over, but Lin Yun merely snorted before unleashing a violent storm of sword rays.

But Chen Tao’s body glowed, using the Glazed Treasure Physique to withstand Lin Yun’s attacks. Even so, he kept retreating whenever he took an attack from Lin Yun.

Carefree 9 Swords—Desolation Sword Form!

As countless sword rays enveloped, Lin Yun merged the Desolation Sword Form with nether energy. His sword was like a world-destroying demonic dragon that emitted a terrifying aura. In the next second, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron became excited, and his sword intent perfectly fused with this destructive aura. This time, the glazed light on Chen Tao’s body completely exploded like porcelain, revealing his actual body.

“The Glazed Treasure Physique broke!” Everyone watching this battle was shocked because that was the famous Glazed Treasure Physique of the Emerald Jade Manor.

As Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind, he turned around and swung his sword once more. This time, an ancient ‘Profound’ word merged with the body, and it looked like a door had opened in mid-air.

The door easily bounced Xuan Feng’s attack back at him. This was Xuan Feng’s first time seeing something so bizarre. An Arhat wielding a blade was hacking towards him, and the killing aura in this attack caused immense mental pressure on him.

“Damn it!” Xuan Feng instantly lost his composure. Wasn’t that his attack? This caught him by surprise. When he was sent flying by this attack, he threw out a mouthful of blood, his face turning black. What the hell was that? His own attack injured him?

Initially, he found this blade technique to be familiar. He finally understood that this was a trick from Lin Yun. Just who the hell was Lin Yun? As the three clashed with Lin Yun, they no longer looked down on him.

But this left everyone on the mountain dumbfounded. Lin Yun was so strong, even when he was facing three enemies. The entire fight wasn’t long, but it was surprising because Lin Yun easily suppressed Chen Tao, Xiao Kui, and Xuan Feng.

“Stop holding back! Let’s use our Glory Saint Artifacts!” Xiao Kui said.

Aside from Chen Tao, the other two could still put up a fight. Or rather, their injuries weren’t serious. After reaching the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, their bones would be strengthened to the point that they would be comparable to ordinary saint artifacts. It wasn’t easy for them to be heavily injured, but they weren’t confident and didn’t want to keep tangling with Lin Yun.

Turning to look at Lin Yun, Chen Tao said, “I admit that the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple is impressive. You even managed to cultivate the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, which is considered a forbidden technique. But this is the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and nothing is fair here. You can admit defeat now. Don’t force us to use our Glory Saint Artifacts!”

He was no longer as arrogant as he was before and no longer demanded Lin Yun to beg for mercy but to admit defeat.

Looking at Chen Tao, Xuan Feng, and Xiao Kui, Lin Yun shook his head disappointedly. After he refined the Golden Lotus, Bodhi Seed, and nether energy, his strength reached a terrifying height. He initially wanted to fight them before making a breakthrough, but the three had cowered when the fight had just started.

Then again, why would they want to put their lives on the line since they had Glory Saint Artifacts? He realized that even the three powerful sects’ chief disciples were nothing impressive. Their Glory Saint Artifacts had considerably worn down their fighting spirits, and he now realized that he was right not to casually rely on external items.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Looking at the three, Lin Yun said, “I suggest you guys not use your Glory Saint Artifacts. After all, Glory Saint Artifacts aren’t invincible. Don’t forget what happened on the mountain.”

The three tried to use their Glory Saint Artifacts to suppress the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, but they suffered greatly, instead.

“Hmph. Still trying to put on a strong front even when facing death!” Chen Tao snorted and took out his Glory Saint Artifact first. The other two took out theirs when he took out his Glory Saint Artifact.

When three Glory Saint Artifacts emitted their terrifying pressure, they instantly sealed off the surrounding space. It was as if time had stopped. Under the empowerment of their Glory Saint Artifacts, their auras exploded as they hovered in mid-air, looking down on Lin Yun.

But looking at them, Lin Yun squinted his eyes and sheathed his sword.

“You want to sheath your sword now? Too late!” Chen Tao suffered the greatest in the fight with Lin Yun and was determined to teach Lin Yun a lesson. So he instantly used his Glory Saint Artifact when he saw Lin Yun sheathing his sword. The empowerment of the Glory Saint Artifact significantly boosted his confidence, “Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, kneel and beg for death!”

Xiao Kui and Xuan Feng furrowed their brows when they heard that, but they quickly followed behind him, fearing an accident might occur. When three Glory Saint Artifacts flew over, the surrounding space around Lin Yun began to distort.

Just when everyone felt Lin Yun would lose, a dragon’s roar echoed, and an umbrella appeared in his hand. When the Dragon Manipulation Tablet was about to reach him, Lin Yun indifferently looked at Chen Tao, “You’re not the only one with a Glory Saint Artifact!”
