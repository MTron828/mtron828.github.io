Chapter 859 - Kings Would Never Meet

Lin Yun’s performance left the Sacred Alliance’s elders shocked because he defeated three geniuses from three different domains within five moves. Furthermore, he didn’t even use his spiritual sword intent. Since when was there such a heaven-defying monster in the Ancient Southern Domain?

“Qing Tu, Lin Yun is only eighteen years old, right? He should be the youngest out of all five Dragoncloud Rankings. The next youngest is Fang Shayou and he’s already twenty-one!” The elder’s words surprised many people as they all turned to look at Qing Tu.

“Indeed,” smiled Qing Tu. He was comforted by Lin Yun’s performance. Although the Sacred Alliance from the different domains were united, it was embarrassing to be responsible for the weakest domain. In the past, elders from the Ancient Southern Domain were all ridiculed by the elders of other domains.

“Not good! That brat is going to run into my domain’s Zhong Xuan!” exclaimed the Mountain Western Domain’s elder. His words instantly drew the attention of the other elders as they saw the choice Lin Yun made would eventually lead to Zhong Xuan.

It was rare for two champions to encounter each other in the third stage. This meant that one of them would be eliminated. If the Mountain Western Mountain’s elder didn’t see Lin Yun’s previous battle, he wouldn’t have such a huge reaction. But after witnessing Lin Yun’s strength, it was natural for him to be worried.

When the other domains’ elders saw this scene, they felt relieved. Anyone who faced Lin Yun in the third stage would be defeated as long as they weren’t ranked number one. The Mountain Western Domain’s Zhong Xuan wasn’t a pushover. If he didn’t run into Lin Yun, it would put immense pressure on the other geniuses. Since the two of them would fight soon, the other geniuses had a chance at progressing one more round.

In the test, Lin Yun combined the four keys and opened the bronze gate to the next stage. What appeared before him was another spacious path. This time, however, his eyesight and movement technique would be tested.

There were many hidden mechanics in the path because of the arrays. Not only did one require excellent eyesight, but they also required understanding towards mechanics. With the spiritual sword intent’s empowerment, there was naturally nothing to say about Lin Yun’s eyesight. However, he didn’t have any understanding of mechanics.

The art of mechanics was divided into puppets, arrays, and artifacts. It was a rare art and not even the most powerful spiritualists could grasp the art of mechanics. Lin Yun wasted some time to make it through the path as four gates stood before him. Clearly, he would face different opponents behind the gates. If one was lucky, they would run into weak opponents.

Luck? Before absolute strength, nothing matters! Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to open the last door that opened up to a hall similar to the previous one. The only difference with this hall was that it was more spacious and a little darker. These differences were attributed to the faint mist on the ceiling that concealed most of the light.

One noticeable difference was that this hall was quiet, unlike the previous hall. Lin Yun wondered if he was alone. While Lin Yun looked around, the elders on the Profound Amber Mountain were anxious. A fight between two champions meant that one would be eliminated.

Qing Tu was nervous because he knew that Zhong Xuan was hiding in the hall. None of the elders were able to discover him because he was so well hidden. This meant that if Lin Yun was careless, he would be heavily injured and lose the fight.

“Weird…” Lin Yun wandered around the hall and spread his sword intent out. However, he couldn’t sense any fluctuations. Even so, he felt uneasy for some reason. If he used the Aurora Dragon Eyes, he might be able to see through some traces.

Is no one really here? Using the Aurora Dragon Eyes would make his eyes uncomfortable for a brief moment. More importantly, he couldn’t use it twice in a row, not to mention that he had to keep some trump cards hidden.

Lin Yun continued to wander the hall and purposefully revealed a few openings. The openings he revealed were brilliant and it was impossible to tell that Lin Yun was doing it on purpose. Fifteen minutes later, Lin Yun calmed down. He was certain that no one was here. He convinced himself that his opponent was probably still undergoing the test, but he still felt uneasy for some reason.

Just as he was about to relax, a bell echoed out in the hall. The ringing jolted Lin Yun’s eardrums and shook his insides. Lin Yun immediately experienced double vision as the entire hall started to distort. When the bell sounded out, the fog on the ceiling dissipated and a figure was revealed. The figure instantly appeared before Lin Yun.

His attack was extremely fast, not to mention that the bell had left Lin Yun briefly stunned. Not only was Lin Yun’s vision disrupted, but he couldn’t even gather his sword intent. There was no way he could lock onto his opponent’s location. Right now, Lin Yun was blind, deaf, and his origin energy was disrupted.

The terrifying thing was that this hidden figure controlled himself from attacking Lin Yun even after he saw a few openings. His scheme was truly terrifying because he only attacked when Lin Yun felt relieved. It was a fatal move that could instantly kill his opponent.

Seeing that the attack was about to reach his forehead, Lin Yun’s pupils blazed with two flames. At this moment, he had executed the Azure Dragon Eyes. In the next second, the fog in his pupils disappeared. Not only was he able to see who was behind the fog, he even saw the flaw in the attack. But with his origin energy and sword intent disrupted, it was uncertain if he could even avoid the attack.

“Impressive, you saw through my appearance. This is for the best. Remember that the Mountain Western Domain’s Zhong Xuan was the one to kill you!” Zhong Xuan didn’t panic even after sensing that Lin Yun had seen his appearance. With a cold smirk, he attacked once more with an even faster speed.

Terrifying black flames exploded from Lin Yun’s palm along with boundless lightning. A lump of black lightning flames containing dragon aura had appeared above his hands. This was naturally Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Breath. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Zhong Xuan’s smile froze on his face. With shock flashing through his pupils, he started to retreat. As he retreated, Zhong Xuan shattered the incoming flames with incredible speed. But he was still stained with a wisp of the dragon flames.

The dragon flames instantly ignited the origin energy around his body and started to spread out. In an instant, half of his clothes were incinerated. When the flames landed on his skin, his organs were incinerated along with the origin energy in his meridians.

Clasping his hands together, more boundless origin energy exploded from Zhong Xuan’s body to force the dragon flames out. At the same time, a glowing ancient bell appeared behind him.

Letting out a breath, the flames in Lin Yun’s eyes died down and were replaced by immense sword intent. When his eyes became intense, the chaotic origin energy within his body simmered down.

The situation had been risky for Lin Yun, but he knew that none of the champions were pushovers. If he didn’t have so many trump cards, he would have lost his life. With a single thought, Lin Yun’s pupils flashed coldly. Since Zhong Xuan wanted to play, Lin Yun couldn’t be blamed for being ruthless. He was determined to make Zhong Xuan pay.

“Hahaha. Brat, do you think that you can defeat me?” Zhong Xuan wore a playful expression. Although he was in a pretty pathetic state, it didn’t affect him. Does this fellow really think that he can confront me just because he dodged my assassination attempt? Avoiding assassination means that he has some means, but it’s a pipe dream if he thinks he can win!

All the elders fixed their attention to the fight between two champions. At this moment, all of them were holding their breaths.

In addition to the Sacred Alliance’s elders, there were a few figures at the top of the mountain. They were the geniuses who were eliminated. When they watched the fight on the screen, they had deep shock in their eyes. Clearly, they were shocked that two champions would clash so early.

If one looked at it carefully, one would realize that a majority of the Ancient Southern Domain were eliminated. Those who were eliminated were Nangong Wanyu, Mu Han, Wu Xiaotian, and Jiang Ziye. They were eliminated in the first and second stages.

“Isn’t it a common rule that kings will never meet so early?” asked Mu Han.

“It was just like how those in the top ten wouldn’t meet each other in the top ten until the last few rounds. However, the selection for the Heavenly Path doesn’t care about that.”

The moment Mu Han heard the answer, the three who were defeated by Lin Yun turned around. As someone from the Mountain Western Domain, Shangguan Qinghong couldn’t hold back his disdain and he began to mock Mu Han, “Country bumpkin, you really know how to decorate yourself with gold. How can the champion of the Ancient Southern Domain be considered a king?”
