Chapter 763 - Uninvited Guests

“Time to head to the Martial Hall.” After leaving the Soul Sword Pavilion, Lin Yun glanced at the sky. Then, he spread his arms apart and flew towards the Martial Hall. The Martial Hall was another important ground in the sect because it held all the martial techniques that the sect had accumulated. There were a total of nine levels and access was only gained if one had the contribution points in their Sword Firmament Token to exchange.

Lin Yun landed in front of the Martial Hall. He tapped his interspatial pouch and retrieved his Sword Firmament Token. The Martial Hall had a total of nine levels, which corresponded with the Sword Firmament Token’s grades.

Playing with the Sword Firmament Token in his hand, Lin Yun painfully recalled the past. When he was a lot weaker, the elder that was guarding the hall nearly crushed his bones. The elder was trying to force him to give up the Overlord Sword.

In the end, Lin Yun managed to pass the test. Not only did he obtain the Overlord Sword, he also obtained a promise to receive the Violet Palace Realm version of the Seven Profound Steps from the elder. However, since Lin Yun was in a hurry last time, he couldn’t get it. He left swiftly after obtaining the Overlord Sword from Guardian Plum and completely forgot about this matter.

He also wasn’t in the Violet Palace Realm back then, so he wouldn’t have been able to use it. But he was completely different now. With his current strength and cultivation, the current Seven Profound Steps were dragging him down. If it wasn’t for the fact that he brought it to the manifestation stage, it would be entirely useless for him in battle.

His movement technique had been his weakness. Against ordinary geniuses, he could suppress them with his sword intent. But if he faced a monstrous genius, they would take advantage of all the flaws in his movement technique. If his enemy didn’t fear his sword intent, then he would be suppressed after a single exchange.

Then again, no one could ignore his sword intent now that it had reached spiritual sword intent. Organizing his thoughts, Lin Yun headed towards the Martial Hall. But the moment he stepped forward, countless gazes fell onto him as all the disciples stopped and bowed.

Their eyes were filled with respect for him as he was now a legend of the Sword Firmament Pavilion. There were many stories of his deeds, especially how he killed Wen Yanbo and forced the Primal Origin Sect to disband.

“Is that Senior Brother Lin? He looks really young, even younger than me.”

“He is indeed very young. I heard that he suffered back then when he came to choose a technique from the Martial Hall.”

“It was just a test from the elder guarding this place. You know nothing.” There were many new disciples in the pavilion that had never seen Lin Yun before, so they couldn’t help being surprised upon seeing how young Lin Yun was.

“Senior, it has been a long time,” Lin Yun cupped his hands to greet the elder.

When the elder saw Lin Yun, he revealed a gratified smile and waved his hand, “I don’t dare to receive your greetings. You’re much stronger than me now, so don’t call me senior anymore. I heard you killed Wen Yanbo with one punch. Well done!”

The two chatted briefly before Lin Yun got to the point. Upon hearing his request, the elder looked at Lin Yun strangely, “The Violet Palace Realm version? I thought you weren’t interested in it. Don’t you have a better movement technique with your current cultivation?”

But when the elder learned that Lin Yun had been using the Seven Profound Steps, he was briefly stunned before he replied, “Alright. This isn’t entirely bad. Come on, follow me.”

Then, they headed towards the highest level of the Martial Hall. When they got to the seventh level, there were no disciples left and the number of martial techniques began to decrease. When they arrived at the ninth stage, the elder sighed, “I can’t remember the last time I was here.”

The elder then pushed the gates apart. The room on the ninth level was rather empty. There were only three martial techniques present and each of them were sealed in an ancient stone box that looked mysterious.

“There are only three martial techniques on the ninth level, the Overlord Sword, the Firmament Sword Sutra, and the Profound Seven Steps at the Violet Palace Realm level.” The elder explained everything to Lin Yun carefully. There was one sword technique, one sword sutra, and one movement technique. These techniques represented the Firmament Sword Pavilion’s foundation.

Lin Yun knew how powerful the Overlord was since there weren’t many martial techniques comparable to it in the Ancient Southern Domain. After all, it was left behind by Ancestor Jian Wuming who had inherited it from the Sword Sect.

The Sword Sect once ruled the Ancient Southern Domain and not even the nine overlord forces could be compared to it. For the Firmament Sword Sutra and Seven Profound Steps to be on this level as well, there must be something special about them.

“Which level have you reached in the Overlord Sword?” The elder asked.

“I’m stupid, so I only managed to reach the fifth form so far.” Lin Yun wasn’t being modest as he always had a high standard for himself. If his sword intent didn’t reach the spiritual sword intent, he would only know up to the fourth form.

“Stupid? Back then, Ancestor Jian Wuming only reached the fifth form and he was practically invincible in the Ancient Southern Domain. If you reach the ninth form, you’ll be invincible in the entire Profound Amber Realm. Since you can reach the fifth form at such a young age, your talent isn’t inferior to Ancestor Jian Wuming.” The elder smiled as he stroked his beard.

With Guardian Plum in seclusion, he could make decisions for Martial Hall. Because the Draconic Banquet was arriving soon, they could circumvent a few rules.

Lin Yun quickly waved his hand. He remembered something about Lord Thirteen and the previous Pavilion Master. They could tell that his sword sutra was extraordinary, which is why they didn’t give him the Firmament Sword Sutra.

“Senior, may I know where Lord Thirteen and the Old Pavilion Master went?” Lin Yun asked.

“They’re both geniuses who would’ve left a long time ago if they weren’t worried about the pavilion. But it’s fortunate that you appeared. Otherwise, who knows how long those two would have stayed.” The elder paused briefly before he sighed, “As for where they went, who knows. Perhaps they already left the Ancient Southern Domain.”

As he spoke, the elder formed a seal with a droplet of his blood essence that opened the stone box. He smiled as he gave the jade slip to Lin Yun, “This is the Violet Palace Realm version of the Seven Profound Steps. It’s true name is Cloud Soaring Art. Like I said, it’s not necessarily a bad thing that you didn’t cultivate other movement techniques because the Seven Profound Steps is derived from the Sun Chasing Divine Art. The Cloud Soaring Art is also derived from it, so you might be able to complete the Sun Chasing Divine Art in the future. At that time, you can chase the sun with your physique alone.”

This is the Violet Palace Realm version of the Seven Profound Steps? Lin Yun’s eyes flashed. His physique could be considered top tier, but his movement technique was his flaw. But with the Cloud Soaring Art, he had corrected his final flaw.

Without even including Wu Xiaotian, he had seen many top-tiered movement techniques in the beast tide. The movement techniques of the overlord forces were much higher than his, so he would surely suffer a loss if he fought them seriously.

“This movement technique is profound, so it will be hard to comprehend if you just reached the Violet Palace Realm. But it’ll benefit you to comprehend it with your current cultivation. Go on,” smiled the elder.

Lin Yun nodded his head and placed the jade slip on his forehead. Scenes began to appear in his mind as a white-clothed man roared and appeared in the sky. His movements were profound and blurred. As he stepped forward, golden light spread out like a golden crow’s wings. Every time they flapped, a golden crow’s cry would also echo out.

Lin Yun fixed his eyes on the old man. In the beginning, his eyes could keep up. But with more time passing, Lin Yun found it harder to keep up with the old man. In the end, the old man took a step and soared into the sky like a genuine golden crow and Lin Yun lost sight of him.

As the scenes gradually faded away from his mind, Lin Yun’s eyes flickered. Four hours later, the light began to dissipate in his pupils as he was done comprehending the Cloud Soaring Art.

“Thank you, senior.” Lin Yun rejoiced because this movement technique was really profound.

The elder smiled because it was good that this movement technique was able to catch Lin Yun’s attention. After all, Lin Yun would be representing the Sword Firmament Pavilion at the Draconic Banquet. The stronger he was, the more beneficial it was for the sect.

Over the next few days, Lin Yun cultivated the Cloud Soaring Art, which he made swift progress in.

Seven days later, two figures entered the Great Qin Empire’s territory, an old man and a youth. They were both from the Profound Yang Hall. The old man was in the Heavenly Soul Realm and his pressure was a lot stronger than Wen Yanbo’s aura. If they had fought, Wen Yanbo would have lost terribly. As for the youth, his pressure wasn’t any weaker than the old man’s.

The young man was Qin Yang, the monstrous genius that Lin Yun met back in Swordmire City. Qin Yang sneered as he was uncomfortable with the low spiritual energy here. “It’s really not easy for us to come, but we’re finally here.”

The old man didn’t utter a word and merely smiled. Suddenly, a sword ray soared into the sky from the Great Qin Empire. Even from their great distance, they could sense how terrifying the sword aura was, which made them frown their eyebrows.

“Someone actually made a breakthrough into the Heavenly Soul Realm in a place like this? This aura isn’t any weaker than the powerful elders in the Profound Yang Hall. That direction seems to be the Sword Firmament Pavilion.” Qin Yang was surprised before his expression became grave. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“It should be Pavilion Master Plum who’s in seclusion.” The old man’s eyes flickered. The Sword Firmament Pavilion might have been founded by Jian Wuming, but it was shocking that it could still produce such a powerful figure.

“But we still have things to take care of.” Qin Yang’s gaze was firm as they had another reason to head to the Sword Firmament Pavilion.
