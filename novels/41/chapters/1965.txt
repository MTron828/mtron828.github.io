Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling awkward after having his intentions detected.

But Wang Yue wasn’t bothered and smiled, “It doesn’t matter. I don’t know how to teach you. Otherwise, I’d really want to exchange it for your Sword of the Beginning.”

It was just like how Lin Yun grasped the Astral Sword Intent but had no idea how to teach it to others. Many things in cultivation could be considered, but martial intent was an exception because it required one to comprehend it. There might be no effects if you try to explain it to someone, and you might even hurt them.

“That’s simple. I’ve already told you previously. If you believe I created this sword technique, I can teach you anytime,” Lin Yun smiled.

Wang Yue rolled his eyes and ignored Ye Qingtian.

Ye Qingtian tried to fool him before, and the intent contained within the Sword of the Beginning was ancient. It felt like it was created in ancient times, and Ye Qingtian might only know that one sword. This was the norm because many ancient books were damaged and incomplete.

This wasn’t something that a Sword Saint could create, let alone Ye Qingtian.

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling bitterly because no one believed him when he was telling the truth. But he didn’t dwell on that for long and asked, “I have something I’d like to ask you. Who is the strongest within the Heavenly Dao Sect?”

He managed to have a rough gauge of Ye Qinghong with their previous exchange, and he wanted to know the strength of the strongest batch of disciples within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Wang Yue briefly pondered before saying, “Let’s not mention the older generation disciples. There are even those at the Quasi-Saint Realm, but they’re already close to a hundred years old. They can be considered peerless geniuses in the outside world, but their aptitude is nothing in holy lands, and they can only join the Golden Guards.”

“Like Bai Xiao, whom we met back in the Contribution Hall?” Lin Yun asked.

“Yeah. They have a noble status comparable to Saint Elder's but have reached the limit of their potential. It’s hard for them to reach the Saint Realm in the future,” Wang Yue said. He continued, “In holy lands, we gauge someone by their potential. They want to nurture geniuses known as the ‘Golden Generation’, who are capable of competing with other geniuses in the Kunlun Realm! In the current Heavenly Dao Sect, only seven can be considered part of the Golden Generation.”

“Golden Generation?” Lin Yun asked with a grave expression.

“That’s right,” Wang Yue replied. “The Blue Dragon Record will appear soon, and a Golden Era will arrive in the Kunlun Realm. It’s not a secret amongst holy lands; we’ve been making preparations since a few decades ago. The Golden Generation is determined to shine in the Golden Era, and they will become saints. Not only will they become saints, but even Saint Sovereign, Great Saint, or an Emperor!”

“That means the Golden Generation has the potential of becoming an Emperor?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right.”

“Who are the seven of them?”

“Let’s start with someone you’re familiar with. The first is the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden,” Wang Yue smiled. “She possesses the Natal Yang Saint Physique and cultivates an ancient cultivation technique, grasping the Ice-Fire Intent. I heard that she’s currently tempering herself to obtain a divine physique. Her cultivation has reached the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and she can reach the Quasi-Saint Realm any time she wants.”

Lin Yun was inwardly alarmed, and he now knew why Bai Shuying was so terrifying. She probably had a secret about her.

“You should be familiar with the second person as well. She’s our Wang Clan’s genius, the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, Wang Muyan.”

“Her? She doesn’t seem that impressive,” Lin Yun said in a surprised tone. If he remembered correctly, Wang Muyan’s cultivation was only at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. Then again, she might have reached the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage now or even the sixth. But her cultivation wouldn’t exceed the seventh.

“Do you know how old she is?” Wang Yue asked. “Strictly speaking, she’s not even twenty and hasn’t even entered the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, according to what I know. Then again, that’s not the most important part…”

Wang Yue hesitated before lowering his voice, “There’s something weird about her. Even the elders of the Wang Clan can’t see her actual appearance. She practices the Thousand Faced Demonic Art, and there are rumors that she possesses the Lunar Yin Divine Physique and a Natal Saint Heart…”

Lin Yun’s face changed, and he fell into deep thoughts. Wang Muyan was so mysterious that even the Wang Clan didn’t know her fully.

“Third is the Holy Spirit Son of the Holy Spirit Courtyard. He was conferred the title of Holy Son at the age of three and has been in seclusion for the past two decades. He’s extremely mysterious,” Wang Yue said. “The fourth is the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s Profound Maiden Miao Yin. She possesses the Primordial Saint Yin Physique and cultivates the Great Yin Saint Canon. She has a mysterious origin, and no one knows where she came from. She caused a huge uproar when she descended in the Profound Maiden Courtyard.”

“No one tried to investigate her?” Lin Yun asked.

“Who would dare to investigate her? The Serene Dust Great saint possesses a Divine Dragon’s bloodline, and it is rumored that she has some bloodline relationship with the Empress. But no one knows why she left her clan,” Wang Yue smiled.

Lin Yun had no change on his face and pondered that it might have something to do with his master, the Radiant Sword Saint.

“The fifth is Ye Feng, a genius of your Ye Clan. You should be familiar with him, and I’ll not mention any further,” Wang Yue smiled.

But hearing that, Lin Yun bitterly smiled because he wasn’t familiar with Ye Feng. He only heard about the name from his senior brother, Ye Guhan.

“The sixth is Zhang Mulan, a genius of the Zhang Clan. He practices the Dragon Clan’s martial techniques and possesses a Divine Dragon Bone. He has the strongest physique amongst all the Heavenly Dao Sect’s saint disciples,” Wang Yue said.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he heard about the Divine Dragon Bone, but his face couldn’t help becoming weird.

“What’s the matter? You know him?” Wang Yue asked, noticing the change in Ye Qingtian’s expression.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled, “No, I don’t.”

He was sensitive to the name ‘Divine Dragon Bone,’ and he couldn’t help feeling his hands itching when he heard about it. After all, he dug out many Divine Dragon Bones, and his face couldn’t help becoming weird.

Wang Yue looked at Ye Qingtian with a grave expression and said, “The last person is also the most mysterious one of the seven, the Dao Yang Palace’s Holy Son.”

Lin Yun was familiar with this name. He already heard of the Dao Yang Palace’s Holy Son when he came to the Heavenly Dao Sect. So it wasn’t weird that he could be one of the seven of the golden generation. He asked, “Where is he?”

“No idea. Perhaps he’s in the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, training in the thirty-six layers of heaven, or he might not even be in the Eastern Desolation.” Wang Yue shook his head.

Lin Yun couldn’t help becoming speechless upon hearing that. After all, wasn’t it the same as having nothing said? He asked, “Have you seen him before?”

“Just a glance from afar. I can only say that he’s extraordinary,” Wang Yue said. “He’s known as the Eastern Desolation’s Twin Stars with the little princess of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, and their names have long spread throughout the Kunlun Realm.”

“Spread throughout the Kunlun Realm,” Lin Yun smiled. He naturally wouldn’t admit defeat to anyone.

Wang Yue noticed it but didn’t say much and continued, “Brother Ye, you still have time to catch up to them. With the Sword of the Beginning, you already possess some grace of the golden generation.”

“Is that so?” Lin Yun smiled.

But Wang Yue didn’t notice a sharp light flashing across Ye Qingtian’s pupils. He misunderstood, believing that Ye Qingtian wasn’t confident and said, “I’m sure about it. Everyone says your current accomplishments come from the saint origin, but I don’t believe that. Executing the Light of the Beginning is impossible to do by purely relying on a saint origin.”

“That’s for sure. I created it, and it has nothing to do with a saint origin,” Lin Yun smiled.

Wang Yue rolled his eyes upon hearing that and chose to ignore what Ye Qingtian said.

After Wang Yue left and the sky darkened, Lil’ Purple finally couldn’t stay within the Iris Secret Realm any longer and yelled, “Let’s go! Let’s go to the Celestial Pool! I know the way! This is a great opportunity because no one will suspect you if you appear in the Nether Orchid Courtyard.”

“Let’s wait a little longer,” Lin Yun said. “I need to keep a low profile after what happened during the day.”

“Since when have you kept a low profile before?” Lil’ Purple said in disdain.

Lin Yun wanted to refute those words, but he ignored her after realizing what she said was right. He would naturally go to the Celestial Pool since he promised Lil’ Purple, but not today. Lin Yun wasn’t that impulsive and would act after becoming familiar with the Nether Orchid Courtyard. Since he decided to maintain a low profile for now, he spent the night practicing the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

When sunlight shone out of the horizon, Lin Yun opened his eyes, and the Netherflower on the ground entered his body. There was a gleam of chilling death energy flashing across his pupils.

The Netherflower within his violet palace had eighty petals, and his Divine Firmament Sword Sutra had reached the pinnacle of the tenth stage for some time now. He would require more death energy if he wanted to make a breakthrough.

Suddenly, Lin Yun noticed an unwelcomed guest entering his courtyard. When Lin Yun came out, he saw a white-clothed figure facing him with their back. The other party didn’t turn around; she was naturally the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden, who possessed such a temperament amongst the disciples of the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

“Come with me. My master wishes to meet you,” Bai Shuying said as she turned to look at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s face changed, having no idea what was happening. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s lecture should be tomorrow. But he suspected he was too focused on his cultivation and asked, “I missed the time?”

“Just follow me,” Bai Shuying said as she soared into the sky.

Lin Yun carried the sword box behind him and quickly followed Bai Shuying. When they descended from the clouds, a mountain was expanding within Lin Yun’s eyes.

Lil’ Purple joyfully exclaimed, “That’s the Nether Orchid Mountain! The Celestial Pool is here!”

Lin Yun’s face became strange upon hearing that and wondered if Bai Shuying was bringing him to the Celestial Pool.
