Chapter 2162 - Curtain Falls

It was shocking to see a few hundred Thunder Qilins descending from the sky. Each qilin possessed a powerful aura that could slay any pinnacle Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase, and this made all the cultivators on the Dragon Mountain feel as though the apocalypse had arrived.

Even a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase would feel their scalp go numb upon seeing this scene, and it would be tough for them to face a qilin, not to mention a few hundred. They couldn’t imagine the pressure that Ye Qingtian was feeling right now.

At this moment, even the Azure Dragon Divine Physique was restrained. The Dragon Trapping Heavenly Dao was a barrier that isolated the stage from the outside world, preventing the divine physique’s aura from being fully unleashed, and all the phenomena disappeared.

Lin Yun took a deep breath because he knew that he couldn’t carry on hiding anymore, so he began to form seals. As a sword vibration echoed, his dual sword stars and the hundred galaxies entered his body. “Heaven and Earth Unite!”

The two sword stars had fused with his body and formed a gorgeous robe while the galaxies formed multiple red cloths that fluttered around. When the Thunder Qilins came in contact with the radiance released from the robe and red cloths, lightning began to splash around. The radiance given off by the robe gradually became dim, but Lin Yun succeeded in blocking the Thunder Qilins.

“As I expected. I knew that you still had trump cards, but I also said that this is just the beginning!” Gu Xiyan smiled, indicating that he had predicted this scene. He then reached out. The Thunder Qilins in the sky retreated and formed into a blurred figure behind him. This figure was blurred, but it gave off a terrifying aura that seemed to be a manifestation of heavenly dao, and the pressure it gave off was unprecedented.

“Kill!” Gu Xiyan roared, unleashing the strongest form of the Heavenly Dao Fist. When the thirty-six layers of heaven shattered, that blurred figure went beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven. This punch was unbelievably fast, reaching Lin Yun in the next second. This caused Lin Yun’s heart to drop as he pushed the Azure Dragon Divine Physique to the limit.

This move from Gu Xiyan was similar to the effect of the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, which summoned the Azure Dragon Constellation from beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven.

“It has come to an end here!” Gu Xiyan’s eyes flashed with exhaustion. Even he didn’t imagine that this fight would come this far. When his attack reached Lin Yun, it shattered the radiance that was released by the Sun-Moon Divine Robe, causing the entire Dragon Mountain to tremble violently.

The other dragon lords could sense their thrones shaking violently, and their eyes were reflected with shock. Situ Yan was also shocked. He had already noticed that Gu Xiyan and Ye Qingtian were on a whole other level during this Blue Dragon Record, but the two of them were on a completely different level in comparison to them.

Gu Xiyan heaved a sigh of relief as he hovered in the air and looked down. When the Heavenly Dao Fist descended, he could sense that his attack had landed on Ye Qingtian. As long as his attack landed on Ye Qingtian, he was confident that this fight had ended, even if Ye Qingtian had that bizarre robe or the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

Everyone knew that this fight had come to an end, but Gu Xiyan knew better than anyone else about the power of his punch. This was the complete first form of the Heavenly Dao Fist. Even he wasn’t confident about taking this punch head-on.

Confident that everything had come to an end, Gu Xiyan descended to the ground. But just when he wanted to throw another punch to end this battle completely, a burst of laughter came from the dust cloud.

With a loud explosion, all of the dust scattered, revealing Lin Yun, who wore a smile, with his clothes stained with blood. “Gu Xiyan, I’m afraid that it hasn’t come to an end yet…”

When the dust dissipated, everyone looked at Lin Yun with disbelief because his figure had overlapped with an ancient cauldron. The ancient cauldron had a dragon and phoenix engraved on it. It was the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron that Lin Yun had brought out to block Gu Xiyan’s attack. This was the first time someone had forced him to this point.

When everyone looked at Lin Yun, their eyes were filled with shock after discovering that Ye Qingtian’s aura had not declined, but had become stronger than before, instead.

“What is that cauldron?”

“This is too weird. Not only does it have the Divine Phoenix, but it also has a Divine Dragon engraved on it.”

“It doesn’t look like the Divine Dragon but more like the Heavenly Dragon.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Doesn’t Ye Qingtian have too many trump cards?” Those who wanted to see Ye Qingtian being defeated were disappointed.

“Just how many trump cards do you have?” Gu Xiyan was surprised, and his indifferent expression changed for the first time.

As Lin Yun moved his fingers, he could sense that after he summoned the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron out of his body, there was some destructive energy flowing throughout his body, and he was about to lose control at any moment. He took a deep breath to recall the cauldron back into his body. The cauldron wasn’t behaving itself, so he had to teach it a lesson later on.

“You don’t have to care about that. Since I’m standing on this stage, the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title is mine,” Lin Yun grinned as he raised his head to look at Gu Xiyan.

A cold light flashed within Gu Xiyan’s eyes, and he asked, “You can’t control it well, right? Are you sure that you want to carry on fighting?”

“How many times can you still use the Heavenly Dao Fist?” Lin Yun retorted.

“Ha, you’ve made a mistake,” Gu Xiyan said. “The Qilin Saint Physique is invincible against those of the same cultivation, and you can’t break through my defenses. I can’t imagine how you can defeat me. Furthermore, who told you that I can’t throw another punch?”

As thunderclouds began to gather, the blurred figure appeared beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven again.

“Myriad Incinerating Flames—Kill!” With a roar, the blurred figure from beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven threw a punch forth that manifested into a bloody ‘kill’ word. The word was enveloped in lightning with countless shackles descending and looked weird, looking like a terrifying tribulation.

“Ye Qingtian, even I can’t control this punch entirely. So you’re on your own!” Gu Xiyan looked at Lin Yun as his temperament became eerie, like a fiendgod. When he said the last word, the crimson word descended towards Lin Yun.

Fine cracks began to appear on the Heavenly Dragon Stage that soon spread out. This was an attack that was unimaginable to those at the Quasi-Saint Realm.

The Dao Yang Holy Son could tell that it was taxing for Gu Xiyan to execute this move, so this should be his trump card.

Lin Yun took a deep breath with his body swaying from a wave of dizziness. It was also beyond his surprise that the competition for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title would come this far. Was the Qilin Saint Physique really invincible?

“Sword!” A rage of flames blazed within Lin Yun’s eyes, and he roared. Accompanied by his roar, a blazing radiance shone from the center of his brows with the sword sea ignited.

Looking at the descending crimson word, Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword and his blood began to boil. The cauldron that was getting restless was being suppressed. The cauldron was a double-edged sword, and Lin Yun wouldn’t use it if he had a choice. In the end, only the Flower Burial Sword was reliable during the critical moment. Even if he was really defeated, he had to be defeated as a swordsman.

Was the Qilin Saint Physique really invincible? Lin Yun inwardly asked himself once more with a flash of murderous intent flashing in his eyes. He was a swordsman, and he even dared to swing his sword at the Heavenly Dao with a sword in his hand.

Pouring his all into this attack, Lin Yun soared to the sky and swung his sword at the crimson ‘kill’ word under countless disbelieving gazes. In the next moment, the crimson word was like a bright sun that shattered, and the terrifying radiance it gave off made the entire Dragon Mountain tremble.

“Back away!” The faces of the dragon lords changed as they spread their arms apart and retreated.

Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan stood before An Liuyan, protecting her instead of retreating. As for the Dao Yang Holy Son, he had long soared to the sky. Ye Ziling wanted to take a closer look at the battle, but she couldn’t see what was happening under the terrifying radiance.

The massive Heavenly Dragon Stage could no longer bear the pressure and had begun to break apart.

“They’re too strong…” Many Saint Realm cultivators smacked their lips while watching the fight between Lin Yun and Gu Xiyan.

“Is there finally going to be an outcome?”

“Is Ye Qingtian going to be suppressed?”

“Even if his sword is powerful, can he even break apart the Heavenly Dao Fist?” Everyone was nervous because they never expected that the fight for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title would be so intense.

As the Heavenly Dragon Stage broke apart, it formed into golden fireballs that soared to the sky, looking like countless suns in the air. Everyone’s gazes fell onto the Heavenly Dragon Stage, wanting to know the outcome of the battle.

Among the shattered fragments of the stage that were hovering in the air, there were two figures standing on them, looking at each other. But the stalemate didn’t last for long as Gu Xiyan’s scales began to fall off, restoring his initial appearance.

Suddenly, he threw out a mouthful of blood and fell onto one knee with his face becoming pale. On the other hand, Lin Yun’s figure had also been restored to normal, but he was standing upright like a sword. The outcome of the battle was obvious.

“What sword technique was that?” Gu Xiyan coughed as he looked at Lin Yun.

No one knew what happened between the two under the dazzling flash of radiance earlier. Evidently, the outcome wasn’t determined even after that battle, but the two fought again under the flash of light. It was pretty obvious, judging from the wounds on Gu Xiyan’s body.

No one knew what happened or how Gu Xiyan’s Qilin Saint Physique was broken. After all, Lin Yun failed even after using two swords earlier. The second time was worse because Lin Yun’s sword had already landed on Gu Xiyan’s forehead, but he was still sent flying away.

But in the final moment, something seemed to have happened, and Gu Xiyan lost his fighting spirit after that.

Lin Yun’s lips moved, but no one could hear what he said since he transmitted his voice to Gu Xiyan alone. After hearing what he said, Gu Xiyan fell into deep thoughts.

“You won… I’ll take back what I said earlier. You’re a prodigy swordsman and even Flower Burial might not be able to defeat you. I’m sure of that.” Gu Xiyan was magnanimous, and he didn’t dwell on his loss.

“I said that as long as there’s a sword in the heart, everyone can be Flower Burial. Others can be, and so can I.” A smile appeared on Lin Yun’s face as he looked at Gu Xiyan with a warm smile.

Gu Xiyan shook his head and said sternly, “It’s different. Flower Burial is the last glory of the Heavenly Paths. We’re from the lower realms, and it's not easy for us to gain a footing in the Kunlun Realm. You won’t know about it, so you won’t know what I feel about him.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned. How could he not know? After all, he was Flower Burial!

“I’m convinced of my loss, but don’t think I’ll jump down the Dragon Mountain like He Xuanjing myself. You can make your move now!” Gu Xiyan looked at Lin Yun with his last stubbornness.

Lin Yun opened his mouth and couldn’t say a word. Since when did he say that he wanted to kick Gu Xiyan off of Dragon Mountain? Even though he was afraid of Gu Xiyan’s talent, why was he so stubborn with his imagination running wild?

Mu Qianjue and He Xuanjing might have been chased off of the Dragon Mountain by him, but Lin Yun had nothing against the champions of the Heavenly Paths. He smiled, “As you wish.”

When Lin Yun pushed his palm forth, Gu Xiyan closed his eyes. But this palm didn’t leave any injuries on him nor was he sent off of the Dragon Mountain. When Gu Xiyan reopened his eyes, he found himself on the Blue Dragon Throne.

Coming to his senses, Gu Xiyan looked at Lin Yun with shock and bafflement.

“Sit tight. It’s better for you to guard the glory of the Heavenly Paths yourself.” Lin Yun turned to look at Mu Xueling who was in the clouds. He grinned, “Saint Elder, let’s announce the outcome.”
