Chapter 403 - Rose Losing Colors

“I’ll promise you.” A weak voice sounded out just as Qin Yu was about to step out of the doors. When Qin Yu heard it, he wore a cold smile. He turned around and he looked at the haggard girl standing in the courtyard.

Xin Yan might seem strong, but it was just a facade. For a long time, she had been on the border of collapsing. Her facade shattered thoroughly when Qin Yu threatened her with Lin Yun. She was a rose who lost her colors.

“Good. The wedding will take place ten days from now. I’ll even give you a grand wedding. After the wedding, your clansmen will regain their surname and they will no longer be slaves. As for your junior brother, I can promise you that no one will touch him,” smiled Qin Yu gently.

Xin Yan’s face was pale as she clenched her jaw. She stared at Qin Yu for a long time before she gnashed her teeth, “Qin Yu, I’ve never seen someone as despicable as you. If I had a choice, I would cut you down right here and now.”

Her words were colder than winter as the killing intent came from the bottom of her heart.

Without any change to his face, Qin Yu replied, “It’s all your father’s fault. Your father colluded with the enemy despite being the Divine Guards’ commander. If it wasn’t for the Sword Firmament Pavilion, you and your big brother would have already been dead by now.”

“Colluded with the enemy?” Xin Yan sneered with disdain. She only felt that it was the greatest ridicule ever. She was young back then, but she had already figured everything out. Her father died because he was from the Sword Firmament Pavilion, which made the emperor suspicious.

“Prepare yourself. I want to let everyone in the empire know about the wedding ten days from now.” It was harder than imagined, but Qin Yu had ultimately completed his goal. With a smile on his face, he turned around and left.

When he came out, he saw Bai Lixuan who had stopped Li Wuyou and Mo Cheng. There were many Locket Mountain’s members standing behind the two of them and all of them were unfriendly.

“You bastard, what the hell did you say to senior sister?” Li Wuyou flared up the moment Qin Yu appeared.

“Behave yourself.” Bai Lixuan merely raised his hand and the sword sheath in his hand struck Li Wuyou’s chest, sending him flying while throwing up a mouthful of blood.

“I already said to behave yourself. Even a hundred of you is nothing in front of me,” said Bai Lixuan with disdain in his eyes.

“Damn it!” Just when Bai Lixuan was about to summon his Martial Soul, Mo Cheng stepped forward and stood before him.

“Your Highness, the Locket Mountain doesn’t welcome you. So please don’t make yourself a guest here anymore in the future,” said Mo Cheng. He had no idea what Qin Yu said to Xin Yan, but he knew that Qin Yu had already visited twice. Everytime he leaft, Mo Chen would see Xin Yan engulfed in sorrow.

“Don’t worry about it. I won’t come anymore. Xin Yan will marry me ten days from now and then she will no longer stay in the Sword Firmament Pavilion,” said Qin Yu. His words were a bomb that shocked everyone.

There were rumors, but no one from the Locket Mountain treated it as real because they believed that Xin Yan wouldn’t marry Qin Yu. There was no way Xin Yan would agree just for wealth and status, not to mention that Xin Jue had just died. Even Bai Lixuan was shocked when he heard it. He never expected that Xin Yan had really agreed to it.

“You’re lying!”

“That’s impossible!” Everyone immediately sounded their doubt as their faces changed.

Li Wiyou roared, “Get out of the way! I want to see Senior Sister Xin Yan and I want to ask her what you did?!”

“I’m sorry,” said Qin Yu. “Strictly speaking, she’s my fiancée now, and she’s not in the right mind to meet with anyone. I’m afraid that I’ll have to ask you people not to bother my fiancée.”

“Bullshit! I demand to see Senior Sister Xin Yan now!” Li Wuyou barked and he was about to charge into the gate. But Qin Yu stood before him with a hint of killing intent flashing within his eyes.

But Bai Lixuan was way ahead of him. He sent Li Wuyou flying and released the pressure from his Saint Physique. He questioned in a cold voice, “What the hell are you guys trying to do? Didn’t you guys hear His Highness’ words? Xin Yan is already his fiancée now. She’s no longer the Senior Sister that you guys can see whenever you like.”

His palm was terrifying and no one saw how he attacked.

“Wuyou.” Someone came up to hold onto Li Wuyou. It was Chen Xuanjun, who was a Heaven Ranking’s disciple. He was the second strongest after Lin Yun in the Locket Mountain. After he came back from the Demonlotus Realm, he had successfully made a breakthrough into the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm.

Chen Xuanjun examined Li Wuyou’s injuries and he spoke out coldly, “Bai Lixuan, you’re also someone a disciple of the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Is there a need for you to injure him so heavily?”

Bai Lixuan wore an indifferent face. He didn’t give Chen Xuanjun any face and replied, “Are you serious? If his recklessness drove a wedge between the royal family and the Sword Firmament Pavilion, a hundred of him wouldn’t be able to make up for it.”

“Bullshit! Bai Lixuan, you traitorous dog. Do you have the Sword Firmament Pavilion in your heart?!” Li Wuyou coughed up blood as he screamed.

“See? Senior Brother Chen. I’ve already gone easy on him judging by how he can still run his mouth off,” said Bai Lixuan as he walked forwards with a cold face. From his expression, it appeared that he wasn’t planning to let this matter go so easily.

“That’s enough. Bai Lixuan, are you still trying to attack him?!”barked Chen Xuanjun.

“You dare stop me?” Bai Lixuan snorted as he looked at Chen Xuanjun who was standing before Li Wuyou. He questioned, “Can you even stop me?”

Along with a sword buzz, he drew his sword. Right in the critical moment, Chen Xuanjun blocked the attack, but he took three steps back and his hand was trembling.

“Do you really think that you scare me as a Heaven Ranking disciple? Chen Xuanjun, I’m being polite by calling you Senior Brother. But do you really think you are any different than a dog in my eyes?”

Right at this moment, the gate opened and Xin Yan appeared before everyone with her face drained of blood, “That’s enough!”

“Senior Sister!” All the Locket Mountain’s disciples turned to look at Xin Yan.

“Bai Lixuan, this is my Locket Mountain and you’re in no position to teach anyone a lesson!” Xin Yan said coldly as she looked at Bai Lixuan.

“You should thank me instead. If His Highness was the one who attacked, do you think that this brat would live?” Bai Lixuan sheathed his sword without any change in his expression.

Raising his eyelid, Qin Yu looked at Xin Yan and said, “We don’t have much time for the wedding preparations. I’ll take my leave first.”

Together with Bai Lixuan, he left Locket Mountain. After everyone left, Mo Cheng was the first who spoke up, “Senior Sister, are you really going to marry him?”

Xin Yan shut her eyes and nodded her head. Her answer made everyone’s heart sink into the abyss as they couldn’t figure it out.

“Look for Elder Luo. Tell him that I want to meet with Guardian Plum.” When Xin Yan reopened her eyes, her gaze was composed without any fluctuations.

Chen Xuanjun sighed. He knew that there must be a story behind this matter.

Nine days later, Guardian Plum appeared at Repent Cliff with a sword box and an interspatial pouch. His expression was calm as he asked, “How have you been?”

Lin Yun looked at his sword box and the interspatial pouch. Feeling curious, he asked, “What’s the matter?”

“Well, it’s considered a piece of good news to you. Han Yang, eleventh on the Great Thief Ranking, has appeared. If you can kill him, then you won’t have to stay on the Repent Cliff anymore,” said Guardian Plum.

The Great Thief Han Yang? Lin Yun had heard of this name before. Many sect disciples and deacons had died to this man. This was a cold-blooded man who killed without batting an eye. Most importantly, he was already in the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm many years ago and he had probably made his breakthrough. Even if he didn’t, his cultivation was at least in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm.

“The sect is really thinking too highly of me, wanting a sinner in the eighth stage of the Profound Martial Realm to undertake such a heavy task,” said Lin Yun.

Guardian Plum didn’t say anything else and he replied, “Dozens of my Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples have died in his hands. This is a very bloodthirsty man that we’re talking about. You can have your freedom back if you kill him and the seven Sword-Bearing Elders won’t have any opinion about it.”

Lin Yun fell into silence as the sudden task had caught him by surprise. Although he already guessed that the sect wouldn’t really keep him here for two years, he didn’t expect it to be so soon, which left him baffled.

He looked at Guardian Plum in confusion, but he couldn’t see anything from the latter’s face.

“I won’t force you if you’re not willing. The Dragon Gate Competition will begin in forty days and you’ll have to wait three years if you miss this chance,” said Guardian Plum as he waited for Lin Yun’s response.

He only had forty days left? Lin Yun sighed because time passed too quickly. Looking at the sword box, he felt somewhat unfamiliar with it when he looked at the flowery patterns on it.

“I’ll agree to it. I’ll bring the Great Thief Han Yang’s head back before the Dragon Gate Competition begins,” said Lin Yun without any hesitation. “However, I wish to see senior sister before leaving.”

He had been feeling uneasy because he had a feeling that something was happening. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Xin Yan doesn’t wish to see you. That’s what she told me,” said Guardian Plum without any expression on his face.

Senior Sister doesn’t want to see me? Lin Yun’s heart jolted.
