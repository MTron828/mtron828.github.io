Chapter 1332 - Fighting Qin Cang

In reality, Qin Cang suffered a cut on his palm, and everything had taken place so fast that most people couldn’t clearly see what just happened.

By the time they realized what had happened, the surroundings fell into a deadly silence. Everyone was shocked by the strength that Qin Cang had shown, sending Ye Ziling back with one palm and injuring Lin Yun with one punch.

After all, one must know that Ning Feng was practically suppressed by Ye Ziling earlier, and the reason why he could last so long was thanks to the ancient armor. As for Lin Yun, there was nothing else to say because he had easily toyed around with Dugu Yan.

But Qin Cang’s strength had given everyone a whole new understanding of him. One must know that Qin Cang hadn’t brought out his constellation, so everyone couldn’t imagine how strong he would become if he did.

“You’re really strong.” Looking at the cut on his palm, Qin Cang wasn’t furious. He then charged forth once more with a smile. He was so incredibly fast that the naked eyes could barely catch up with him. He then swung his hand out.

Lin Yun tried to thrust his sword at him, but the sword was struck by Qin Cang’s palm, and the Lightning Shadow Sword was sent flying instead.

“This…” Lin Yun was shocked because Qin Cang’s strength was a little terrifying.

“You don’t have to be shocked. After all, I said that Sikong Zhou can’t even last one palm from me.” Qin Cang grinned as his eyes shone brightly. When a golden dragon roar echoed, Qin Cang emitted the aura of a true dragon and waved his hand. His arm was like a dragon claw, making the weather change when he waved his arm.

When his arm turned into a dragon claw that was filled with a devastating power, he dropped it towards Lin Yun’s head. If it was a normal attack, Lin Yun wouldn’t be afraid of a head-on clash thanks to the Azure Dragon Saint Art. But Qin Cang was attacking with the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art, so he couldn’t afford to be careless.

“Divine Solar Lunar Fist!” Lin Yun moved and pushed the Golden Crow Nine Transformation to the limit. He then split it into two, one charged at Qin Cang with the aura of a golden crow while the other charged at Qin Cang with the aura of a silver phoenix. When Lin Yun clashed with Qin Cang once more, the surrounding space distorted with Lin Yun taking ten-odd steps back while Qin Cang hadn’t even taken a step back.

“This is the strength of the Empyrean Ranking’s first rank?” Ye Ziling had fear lingering in her eyes as she laid in Su Ziyao’s embrace.

“If a Heavenly Elysium Core Realm doesn’t show up, no one can face Qin Cang head-on,” said Su Ziyao. “Lin Yun is suffering a loss because he hasn’t reached the Elysium Core Realm. But you don’t have to be too worried about him.”

Heavenly Elysium Core Realm? Ye Ziling was disappointed when she heard that. She knew that Su Ziyao had a mysterious origin, so her eyesight was a lot higher than most people there. Since she already said that, then there must be no mistakes.

As Qin Cang hovered in mid-air enveloped in a golden light, he said, “Interesting. The Divine Solar Lunar Fist. I’ve heard of it but never seen it before. You should’ve brought it to the manifestation stage, right?”

Qin Cang knew that Lin Yun had reached a high level in this fist technique. If it wasn’t for his cultivation being so low, it would have been difficult for Qin Cang to not take a step back from the collision.

“But you can only surrender today. Don’t worry because I won’t kill you. But you also won’t be able to compete for the Great Saint Origin, so kneel well here!” Qin Cang was prideful, and his words were filled with confidence.

Suddenly, their was the sound of heaven shattering as an ancient dracoape appeared. Lil’ Red decided to give up on beating Zhang Jin up and turned to swing its staff at Qin Cang. Furthermore, it was enveloped in a demonic aura and even devoured the true dragon aura that Qin Cang gave off.

This scene made everyone take in a cold breath because the ferocity of this dracoape had exceeded everyone’s expectations. But before anyone could recover from their shock, Qin Cang had already reached out and grabbed onto the staff.

No matter how the dracoape roared, it couldn’t pull back the staff at all. Seeing this, Qin Cang smiled as a dragon roar echoed from within his body and he twisted the staff in his hand. This caused the staff to smack against the dracoape’s hand, causing the dracoape to let out a miserable howl before it fell to the ground, returning to its cat form.

Seeing this, Qin Cang let out a roar before he tossed the staff away. When the staff plunged into the ground, the sheer impact of Qin Cang’s toss left cracks on the ground. As Qin Cang’s hair fluttered in the wind, he headed towards Lin Yun once more.

“No one can save you today!” Qin Cang was indifferent as he walked towards Lin Yun with a true dragon coiling around him.

When Lin Yun took a look at Lil’ Red, a cold light flashed through his pupils. Qin Cang was a little too strong. Qin Cang was the strongest opponent that he had come across ever since he came to the Kunlun Realm. It was so much so that Lin Yun wasn’t confident that he could win if he brought out the Firmament Sword Intent. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

As for the Sovereign Constellation, he still had no idea how many paintings he could bring out because it was a little tough for him to summon the entire constellation. When his gaze fell onto Qin Cang’s chest, he fell into deep thoughts.

.

“That’s the Golden Dragon Bone,” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded.

“I know.”

When Qin Cang suppressed him with the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art earlier, he noticed what was wrong very quickly. But even so, he still suffered a pretty decent injury. He only managed to break free from the suppression after activating the Blood Flame Divine Rune. This was because the Azure Dragon Saint Art was ultimately incomplete.

As Qin Cang walked over, the surrounding situation soon became dangerous and this made Lin Yun look helpless.

“Qin Cang, don’t take it too far!” Sikong Zhou finally made a move. He drew his sword out and even activated the origin saint rune on his elysium core.

But Qin Cang merely turned to glance at him with a black demonic lotus stained in blood in his pupils. Before Sikong Zhou could even take a step out, he was already sent flying away and threw out a mouthful of blood.

“How is this possible?!” Sikong Zhou was completely dumbfounded because he couldn’t imagine how strong Qin Cang had become. At the same time, everyone held onto their mouths while feeling their hearts beating wildly.

Qin Cang was simply too strong and they couldn’t imagine who could suppress him as long as a Heavenly Elysium Core Realm expert didn’t show up. Was this the strength of someone ranked first on the Empyrean Ranking?

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren!” The Profound Sky Sect’s disciples cheered with their blood boiling.

“I’ve already said that no one can save you today, and you can only obediently kneel here. As for the Great Saint Origin, it has nothing to do with you because it’s mine!” Qin Cang coldly said with his arrogance reaching a peak while coldly looking at Lin Yun.

But the moment he was done, a blade ray pierced through the void and flew over, shattering the true dragon around him, and landed on Qin Cang’s chest. This caused sparks to fly before revealing a three-colored armor that Qin Cang was wearing that helped him to take this attack. But even so, he was still sent flying back.

Right at that moment, a figure landed on the ground and said, “Is there any interest in a pinnacle Elysium Core Realm like you who refined the Demonflame Lotus to bully someone in the Empyrean Realm?”

“You again!” Qin Cang squinted his eyes while looking at the newcomer.

The newcomer had short white hair and sheathed his blade. Qin Cang had met this person before when they fought for the saint elixir outside the Profound Wither Island, and the saint elixir was taken away by this person.

Lei Jue and Xuan Ying quickly appeared beside Qin Cang, emitting terrifying auras. Looking at this scene, everyone could feel their scalps going numb. The Three Saints of the Profound Sky Sect have gathered together.

Just Qin Cang alone was already incredibly strong. So they couldn’t imagine how strong the Profound Sky Sect would be with the addition of Lei Jue and Xuan Ying. At the same time, they finally knew why the Profound Sky Sect was the overlord of the Ancient Barren Domain. They had a terrifying foundation, not to mention that they were a lot stronger than the other powerful sects.

“Senior Brother, do you need our help to hold back this person?” Lei Jue asked. He knew that Qin Cang was interested in Lin Yun at this moment and didn’t wish to be interrupted.

“No need,” smiled Qin Cang. “There’s no fairness in this world, to begin with. Two years ago, I had already started challenging the transcendents on the Elysium Core Realm, losing more than winning. This is a world where the strong prey on the weak. If you’re not convinced by it, you can come at me together with him. Anyhow, I know that the two of you have trump cards, so I’m looking forward to seeing what your trump cards are. If I have to summon my constellation, then consider it my loss!”

“I advise you not to be too confident in yourself.” Lin Yun replied coldly and waved his hand, summoning the Flower Burial Sword from his sword box. When he held onto the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun’s aura suddenly changed.

Standing beside Qin Cang, Lei Jue and Xuan Ying both let out a groan before they were both forced to take two steps back. At this moment, everyone knew that Lin Yun really still had trump cards because his entire aura had changed the moment he held onto the Flower Burial Sword.

“Now, this is more interesting.” Qin Cang smiled as his hair fluttered in the wind. But just when the two of them were about to fight, the sky suddenly turned dark.

When everyone raised their heads, they could see the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda growing bigger in their eyes, making everyone feel suffocating from the pressure. Before it even landed on the ground, cracks had already begun to spread out on the ground, extending to a few hundred miles away. As the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda continued to descend, the entire Profound Wither Island even showed signs of collapsing.

“Retreat!” Qin Cang and Lin Yun’s faces changed as they both retreated. They could sense the aura of the Great Saint Origin from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda.

As the golden wings behind Lin Yun flapped, he grabbed ahold of Ye Ziling and Su Ziyao before he bolted far away. Everyone else was also running away from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, fearing that they would be suppressed by the pagoda.
