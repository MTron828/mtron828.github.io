Chapter 1272 - Demonic Elixir

“S-S-Save me…!” The purple-clothed youth exclaimed in fear, asking Lin Yun for help while he was tangled up by the demonic vine.

When Lin Yun made his move and pushed the Golden Crow Nine Transformation to the limit, a pair of golden wings appeared behind him. His speed was incredibly fast, and he had saved both Gongsun Yan and Zhao Yan in the blink of an eye.

Seeing that Lin Yun chose to save Gongsun Yan and Zhao Yan instead, the purple-clothed youth from the Azure Thunder Sect screamed his last words before he was dragged into the blood pool, “Lin Yun, I curse you to die a terrible death!”

Not long later, a skeletal frame floated on the blood pool. Both Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan were blankly staring at this scene with a chill down their spines as they moved closer to Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun stowed the pair of golden wings back into his body, he looked at the blood pool without a hint of fear in his eyes. The ancient array enveloping the summit was slowly crumbling, and the Dragon Blood Fruit was slowly breaking free. At the same time, the terrifying energy surging within the blood pool was shocking.

“It’s staring at me,” said Lin Yun. He could sense a pair of greedy eyes looking at him, but it was afraid of the aura that Lin Yun was giving off so it didn’t dare to make a move.

“That fruit probably bore intelligence.” Zhao Yan said with fear flickering in his pupils. “This is a little bizarre, and it will probably become evil after becoming a saint elixir.”

Many high-graded elixirs would possess intelligence when it was born and would escape any dangers. It wasn’t surprising at all for a saint elixir to bear intelligence. But this array set up by the eight geniuses went against the law of nature, to begin with, by using blood and flesh to nourish the Dragon Blood Fruit. So the rage and grievance from their victims was probably inherited by the Dragon Blood Fruit as well, thus affecting its intelligence.

It was like a blank piece of paper because it was just born, but the eight geniuses made it black. So if it could be fully born, it would definitely be a demonic creature.

“Let’s go… That’s no longer a saint elixir, but a demonic elixir that not even experts of the demonic cult would dare to touch,” said Gongsun Yan in a trembling voice.

“Saint and demon are just a single thought. Disregarding its intelligence, it definitely has a rare medicinal effect.” Lin Yun shook his head with no intention of leaving.

“That might be the case, but it can devour you if you’re not careful. At that time, its strength will boost even further. The eight geniuses used an ancient array to suppress it, so how are you going to suppress it alone?” Gongsun Yan looked at Lin Yun. Even after the battle, he could still sense the explosive vitality coming from Lin Yun, and Lin Yun was practically a walking nourishment for the Dragon Blood Fruit.

Lin Yun looked at Gongsun Yan and smiled, “Didn’t you say that you’re leaving? So why did you follow me? Don’t tell me you wanted to see how I’ll be humiliated by the eight of them?”

“No, I’ve never thought of that. Don’t accuse me. Do you think I, Gongsun Yan, am that kind of person? I’m someone with the dignity of the Sword Emperor!” Gongsun Yan’s face turned red after having his inner thoughts revealed by Lin Yun.

“He joined forces with me earlier. But he said that he’d go look for reinforcements after we lost and ran first,” said Zhao Yan.

“I’m indeed no match for the eight of them,” said Gongsun Yan.

“Only two of them.” Zhao Yan indifferently exposed.

Hearing that made Gongsun Yan awkward with the corner of his lips twitching before he explained, “Even if the others didn’t make a move, their presence itself is intimidating enough. I might have only faced two of them, but I also had to be cautious against the others. So it’s not an exaggeration to say that I was also facing all eight of them.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Haha.” Zhao Yan sneered.

Hearing that, Gongsun Yan couldn’t refute anymore and his face also became ugly. But right at this moment, Zhao Yan said, “But he’s right. If the Dragon Blood Fruit really devours you, it will gain a great boost in strength.”

“Then I’ll wait for it here and see who devours who.” Lin Yun clearly knew that the Dragon Blood Fruit wanted to devour him after reaching the height of saint elixirs, but Lin Yun also shared the same thoughts or he would’ve dug it out from the blood pool by now.

He just wanted to wait for it to reach the height of a saint elixir, especially since this was a Dragon Blood Fruit. There was a huge difference between a quasi-saint elixir and a saint elixir, along with the value, not to mention that this Dragon Blood Fruit devoured the essence of many geniuses. So it wasn’t an exaggeration for Gongsun Yan to call it a demonic elixir.

“You guys fall back first.” Lin Yun walked towards the blood pool. When he approached the blood pool, the it began to boil with an immense power that was accumulating within it, as if it would explode in the next moment.

The distance was short, making both Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan horrified. When Lin Yun came to the border of the blood pool, he sat down and closed his eyes.

“This…” Gongsun Yan’s lips twitched when he saw this scene. He was arrogant and prideful, but he wouldn’t hesitate to bow when needed. He would definitely not put himself in danger, unlike Lin Yun.

When Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan were shocked by those words, they both backed away when they sensed the terrifying aura being emitted from the blood pool. They couldn’t imagine how powerful the Dragon Blood Fruit would become after becoming a saint elixir.

“You’re not leaving?” Gongsun Yan gulped down a mouthful of saliva. The summit of the snowy mountain was piled with corpses, especially the ancient aura that was there not long ago. The look of death from the corpses in the surroundings was horrifying, especially the purple-clothed youth from the Azure Thunder Sect. He was left with just his skeletal frame floating on the blood pool.

“Let’s wait and see,” said Zhao Yan. To be honest, he was afraid. But he was worried for Lin Yun, who placed himself in danger.

“Then you can continue to stay here. I’ll be taking my leave first.” Gongsun Yan shook his head and felt that this was too dangerous. So he didn’t hesitate to turn around and leave.

“Shit!” Gongsun Yan began to hesitate after taking a few steps and felt that his conscience wouldn’t let him leave. No matter what, Lin Yun had saved him earlier. So he returned and sat beside Zhao Yan.

At that moment, the entire island had become quiet. Everyone could still feel their blood boiling from the previous battle, witnessing how Lin Yun killed one genius after another. That scene had left a deep impact on them and they had yet to recover from their shock.

As for the disciples of the big sects that were scattered around the island, they were all dumbfounded and couldn’t believe what they saw. After all, the big sects joined hands to isolate the quasi-saint elixir from others. But Lin Yun appeared out of nowhere and slaughtered the eight geniuses. If news of this gets out, it would definitely set off a huge shock. Most importantly, the big sects have formed a rapport for the competition over the quasi-saint elixir.

They only got their disciples to compete over it because it wasn’t a saint elixir. Dragon Pulse Realm elders would follow them if it was a saint elixir because it was something that even a Dragon Pulse Realm expert would be tempted by. But the quasi-saint elixir wasn’t that important to them.

Without any elders around, the disciples of the big sects didn’t dare to approach the summit because they could sense the deathly aura gathering at the summit, even from afar.

“Who the hell is that fellow? Lin Yun, his name sounds a little familiar but I can’t recall anything about him.”

“Isn’t he a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? His name is well-known in the Profound Azure Prefecture.”

“Bullshit. How can a genius of his caliber be from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? He definitely has an origin and you just don’t know about it.”

“Silence! He has already offended the eight big sects; now, no one can save him.”

“So what? You guys called us ants and now, an ant killed one of your own. Hahaha!” A commotion broke out on the island after a brief silence. The faces of the disciples from the big sects were ugly, but no one was afraid of them anymore and even showed signs of ganging up on them.

When the disciples of the big sects saw that the situation wasn’t right, they immediately shut up and fled. They were used to standing on a high point and had never placed these people in their eyes. But now that the tables have turned against them, they didn’t have any choice but to suck it up.

“Let’s wait. The elders will pay attention to this, sooner or later.” They looked at the summit of the snowy mountain with deep hatred in their pupils. At the same time, they were surprised because the Dragon Blood Fruit should’ve been born by now. But that entire region was enveloped in darkness and the quasi-saint elixir still showed no signs of appearing.

“Weird.” Lil’ Purple, who was collecting saint liquid, turned to look at the summit of the snowy mountain. She could sense an unusual aura from the summit. That aura was evil and was a lot more violent than a quasi-saint elixir.

“Don’t tell me that it is a saint elixir?” Lil’ Purple had suspicion on her face before she tossed the matter to the back of her mind. She was already used to Lin Yun causing an uproar wherever he went. Seeing that she continued to collect the saint liquid, Lil’ Red also followed behind her, holding onto a huge jar.
