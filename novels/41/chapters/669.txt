Chapter 670 - Stay Since You’re Here

The scene of Yang Pengfei kneeling on the ground silenced the entire plaza. No one expected this outcome, so everyone’s brain had gone blank. They still couldn’t process what just happened.

Simultaneously, Lin Yun’s arrogant voice echoed in everyone's ears. The savage expression on Lin Yun’s face had left everyone stunned. Clearly, no one had expected that Lin Yun would have such an arrogant and savage side.

Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind while everyone reexamined him. The faces of the geniuses from the various forces had become ugly. Yang Pengfei kneeling on the ground was a slap to their faces. After all, they had berated Lin Yun that they would teach him a lesson. However, Lin Yun easily suppressed Yang Pengfei.

Lin Yun merely used three steps to defeat Yang Pengfei. He even made Yang Pengfei kneel on the ground.

Qing Ruoyou also turned to look at Lin Yun, but unlike everyone, there was no change in her expression. However, Xiang Tianhe, who was standing next to her, began to tremble as he could sense a terrifying chill accumulating within Qing Ruoyou’s body. This made fear rise within his heart.

Clearly, the outcome had also exceeded Qing Ruoyou’s expectations.Her existence was high in the sky, so she didn’t want to lower herself to fight Lin Yun. This was the reason why she called out to the geniuses here to teach Lin Yun a lesson. But her plan was ruined once Yang Penfei kneeled on the ground.

Her words from before had turned back to slap her face. Yang Pengfei kneeling on the ground wasn’t just a slap to the faces of the geniuses in the Skymound City, but it was also a slap to her face.

She had been enveloped in a halo for as long as she could remember. Even the three kings and seven elites were courteous to her. She had never suffered such grievance in her life, which was why her eyes were blazing with surging killing aura now. But because of her words from before, she couldn’t make a move against Lin Yun. So this grievance made Qing Ruoyou clench her fists tightly.

Up on the stage, Luo Yu took a deep glance at Lin Yun and nodded his head inwardly. Lin Yun was truly extraordinary and anyone could tell that Lin Yun wasn’t just an ordinary genius. He had only used three steps and a palm to defeat Yang Pengfei. How many geniuses could accomplish that?

“Holy shit…”

“The Skymound City will be thoroughly humiliated if we don’t stop him.”

“This is too humiliating. Yang Pengfei even called Lin Yun a sword slave, but he was actually so easily defeated.” An uproar exploded out on the plaza as the expressions of the Skymound City crowd turned sour.

“Lin Yun!” Chen Xiong suddenly called out as he looked at Lin Yun, “Don’t you think you’re too much? Brother Yang was already defeated, so why did you take it further and humiliate him? Are you disregarding the Skycloud Sect?”

His words were what those from the Skycloud Sect wanted to sect. They were all looking at Lin Yun furiously, but there was nothing they could do about it since even Yang Pengfei was defeated.

“Humiliate him?” Lin Yun sneered, “So you don’t think that him calling me a sword slave is humiliating for me? Since he dares to humiliate me, then he should be prepared to be humiliated. Although I don’t mind the fact that I was once a sword slave, that doesn’t mean that I don’t have a temper. Since he hasn’t admitted defeat, what’s the problem? Can’t I make him kneel?”

Damn it! Chen Xiong was furious by Lin Yun’s words. It wasn’t because Yang Pengfei didn’t want to admit defeat, but he couldn’t open his mouth under Lin Yun’s pressure.

“Release him!” Chen Xiong said coldly as he released an eerie aura with his hair fluttering in the wind.

“Interesting. Who are you to interfere in this matter? Are you in any position to speak?” replied Lin Yun.

“Since Brother Chen commanded you to release him, then do as he says. If we’re in no position to speak in the Skymound City, then are you in that position?” Qin Ziluo looked at Lin Yun coldly as he also unleashed his sword aura.

“Once a sword slave, always a sword slave. Hmph, acting so arrogant just because you have a slight advantage…” said Jin Ling.

The geniuses of the various forces had commanded Lin Yun to release Yang Pengfei without any concern of right and wrong. They acted like Lin Yun would be condemned to eternal damnation if he didn’t oblige. They didn’t even consider the fact that Yang Pengfei was planning on killing Lin Yun without giving him any chance to admit defeat.

Then again, their actual motive was to enrage Lin Yun. In their view, Lin Yun had already revealed all his means by defeating Yang Pengfei. As long as they treated Lin Yun seriously, they were confident that they could defeat Lin Yun, especially Chen Xiong who was the strongest here.

He had considered this the perfect stage for him to perform before Qing Ruoyou. He initially thought that Yang Pengfei was lucky, but he never expected that Yang Pengfei would be such a failure. Not only was he the humiliation of Skymound City, but he even kneeled before Lin Yun.

Since that was the case, then he could only take advantage of the opportunity. Chen Xiong waved his hand, “I’m giving you one last chance. Are you going to let him go? If you do, then I’ll only cripple your cultivation. Otherwise, I’ll torture you and make you my slave for life!”

“I’ll be honest with you. I have no intention of letting him get back up on his feet since I’ve made a move,” said Lin Yun in a playful tone. “A slave for life? I’m afraid you’re not capable of that.”

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with sword intent as the Flower Burial Sword within the sword box began to buzz. He was accumulating his sword intent within his body at this moment and blood began to ooze out from his skin beneath his clothes due to the boundless sword intent surging within his body.

“Looks like you didn’t take my words to heart,” grinned Chen Xiong as he soared into the sky, unleashing a chill aura that formed an ancient monument. Armed with this attack, he charged towards Lin Yun.

“That’s the Frost Monument Sutra!” The moment the monument appeared, it instantly caused an uproar as many people recognized it as the Chen Clan’s cultivation technique. Only those who had reached a high stage in this cultivation technique could condense the ancient monument.

Chen Xiong didn’t merely summon the stone monument. The monument actually had words that could be vaguely seen, which signified that he had a high attainment in the technique.

“Great! Lin Yun will be defeated now. Chen Xiong is practically invincible among those in the same stage. No matter what Lin Yun does, he’ll be suppressed by the monument!”

“Haha, it won’t be as simple as suppression. If this brat isn’t tactful, he might even be crushed by the monument.”

“Probably not. Chen Xiong said he’ll make Lin Yun a slave for life. He’ll probably thoroughly cripple Lin Yun. After all, this is the greatest humiliation for any genius.” The local cultivators all had joy in their eyes when they saw this scene. All of them began to cheer for Chen Xiong.

After this battle, the Chen Clan might surpass the Skycloud Sect. It was killing two birds with a stone. Not only could Chen Xiong win Qing Ruoyou’s favor, he could also boost the Chen Clan’s reputation. Just thinking about it made Chen Xiong’s face even more sinister as he pounced at Lin Yun.

But just when he was about to get close to Lin Yun, a terrifying sword intent suddenly exploded out.

Upon sensing the sword intent, even Xiang Tianhe’s face had changed as his jaws dropped. After all, it was the xiantian sword intent at complete mastery. But that wasn’t all as a domineering aura exploded out from Lin Yun, empowered by his sword intent.

This caught Chen Xiong by surprise as the sword ray destroyed his monument, which made him spit out a mouthful of blood. After this, Chen Xiong had fear in his eyes and quickly turned to retreat.

“Since you’re here, don’t bother leaving,” said Lin Yun as he hacked down the Flower Burial Sword.

The sword was like a whip that landed on Chen Xiong’s head, causing him to throw up even more blood. But Chen Xiong was struck with the body of the sword, not the edge. In the next second, Chen Xiong landed beside Yang Pengfei on his knees.

He had humiliation on his face as he struggled to get back on his feet. But the Flower Burial Sword was placed on his head, so he couldn’t get back up no matter what he did.

“This…” Everyone in the plaza was shocked by this scene as they couldn’t utter a single word. They only felt a stinging pain on their cheeks from shame.
