Chapter 1538 - Profound Sky Canon

Mu Chuan took out several saint pellets and fed them to Feng Jue before circulating his samsara energy through Feng Jue’s body. But it didn’t change anything, Feng Jue’s vitality was still falling. At the same time, saint aura was being emitted from Feng Jue’s pores, and those were the saint pellets that were fed to him. This was a sign that Feng Jue’s body couldn’t digest the saint pellets.

“His foundation is damaged. He can’t digest any saint elixirs. We must immediately bring him back to the sect!” Mu Chuan’s eyes dimmed, and he said in a sorrowful voice, “Perhaps only master can save him.”

“Let’s go, then!” Lin Yun said before he suddenly stopped. “Wait!”

“What’s the matter?” Mu Chuan looked at Lin Yun, baffled.

“Senior Brother, let me give it a try.” Lin Yun said, looking at Mu Chuan. They didn’t have much time. Feng Jue might not be able to last till they returned to the Sword Sect. Moreover, Lin Yun didn’t wish to trouble his master.

“You?” Mu Chuan looked at Lin Yun with his brows furrowed.

“Let me give it a try… I have obtained the Blue Dragon Bone. The Blue Dragon is of the wood attribute. If I can activate the divine rune, I might be able to save Senior Brother Feng Jue.”

“No, you can’t. How can you possibly activate the innate divine rune with your cultivation?”

“Senior Brother, let me give it a try.” Lin Yun insisted.

But Mu Chuan locked his brows and replied, “Do you know why Junior Brother risked his life to protect you? Even to the point where he’d rather die instead of you? You’re the hope of the Sword Sect.”

“Hope of the Sword Sect?” Lin Yun replied, “I don’t mind carrying such hopes. But I’m more concerned about those around me. So please, let me try!”

“Let him try. This empress doesn’t think he can last till you guys make it back to the Sword Sect, and you know it yourself.” Lil’ Purple stood out right at this moment.

When Lin Yun heard that, he no longer cared what Mu Chuan thought and sat behind Feng Jue. Lin Yun circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra with both palms on Feng Jue’s back. As boundless astral energy turned into ninety-nine streams, they flowed towards the Blue Dragon Bone.

A blue dragon appeared around Lin Yun, and a terrifying dragon aura started to accumulate. After entering the Blue Dragon Bone, his astral energy also entered a vast world. When he was done, he opened his eyes and consumed a Profound Wither Pellet before placing his palms on Feng Jue’s back again. This time, he circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra and Iris Sword Sutra.

Sensing his astral energy ocean withering, Lin Yun soon found a blue divine light in the Blue Dragon Bone. That was the innate divine rune engraved on the Blue Dragon Bone and it was radiating as brightly as a sun in his eyes.

Based on his current cultivation, the astral energy he could manipulate was nothing before this divine rune. But Lin Yun had long decided and no longer hesitated to use the nether energy to raise the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron from his astral energy ocean.

When the cauldron rose from the ocean, Lin Yun’s aura grew, and the astral energy he poured into the Blue Dragon Bone increased. This made Lin Yun’s face pale quickly, and his forehead was covered in sweat because it was so difficult.

Even if he had boosted his cultivation with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron, he still couldn’t use the Blue Dragon Divine Rune. In the critical moment, his dual sword souls flew out from his sword ocean and entered the Blue Dragon Bone, empowering his astral energy. As wisps of blue light flowed into Feng Jue’s body from his palm, Feng Jue’s vitality started to increase.

“He succeeded? This…” Mu Chuan was shocked by this scene. Lin Yun could use an innate divine rune, even though he didn’t look to be in a good state. But Mu Chuan soon froze because he suddenly recalled what Lin Yun had said earlier. Divine Dragon Bones couldn’t be found anywhere, and Lin Yun didn’t have one when he left the Sword Sect.

Mu Chuan instantly decided to ask Lin Yun about it after he was done. Could it be that this was related to the descent of his master’s clone to the Netherworld Hall?DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

An hour later, Lin Yun’s hands left Feng Jue’s back. He briefly opened his eyes to look at Feng Jue before he collapsed, unable to say a word. This scared Mu Chuan. He rushed forth and fed Lin Yun a saint pellet.

“Junior Brother, rest for a while.” Mu Chuan said as Lin Yun’s eyes closed.

Hearing the crackling of flames, Lin Yun woke up from his sleep. When he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was that the sky was dark, and he could see a bonfire not too far away.

Mu Chuan was roasting the meat of a demonic beast over the fire, with Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red happily feasting on the meat.

“You’re awake!” Mu Chuan smiled. “Come, have a drink.”

Lin Yun’s mind was still in a state of confusion since he had just woken up. He briefly shook his head before heading towards the bonfire. It was just a few steps away, but his legs felt like lead.

“Here.” Mu Chuan sliced a piece of meat for Lin Yun. When Lin Yun tasted the meat, he discovered that Mu Chuan’s skills weren’t any inferior to his own.

“Where’s Senior Brother Feng Jue?” Lin Yun asked.

“He’s asleep. He’s fine, and this might be a fortune for him.” Mu Chuan smiled. He was still pretty concerned about Feng Jue. Although Feng Jue was a little stupid, he had pure thoughts and a pure heart.

“Senior Brother, what are you doing here?” Lin Yun asked.

“The Sect Master sensed a Samsara Edict Realm expert’s aura near the Sword Sect and got me to check it out. When I saw the moon, I immediately rushed over.” Mu Chuan explained.

Lin Yun finally understood the entire story after hearing from Mu Chuan. If Jin Jue didn’t summon his constellation, the Sword Sect still might not have been able to sense the commotion. It was really dangerous for him, even more so than when he was at the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.

Jin Jue was too sinister to wait for him to use all his trump cards before making a move. This also strengthened Lin Yun’s determination to take revenge in the future. He asked, “Senior Brother, I still have a question.”

“Go on.”

“Back on the Heavenly Path, his strength is on par with Senior Brother Feng Jue. So why is there such a huge difference when he became a King?”

“It’s normal for you to have such a question, and the situation is a little special.” Mu Chuan took several gulps of wine and said, “First is his cultivation technique. After Tian Xuanzi completed the Profound Sky Canon, it became a dragon spirit cultivation technique. Upon reaching the tenth stage, there will be a terrifying transformation.

“The Profound Sky Canon has nineteen stages, and it was initially half complete. But Tian Xuanzi completed it in a hundred years, relying on his monstrous talent. The first nine stages are only the entry, and the tenth stage is where it begins since one can summon a moon. Sun for the eleventh stage, gold for the twelfth stage… they all correspond with the seven radiants. Above them are the Great Profound Heaven and Tribulation Heaven.

“At the last stage, one can form the Profound Sky Universe within the body. At that time, the power of this cultivation technique will be comparable to a divine spirit cultivation technique. At that time, one can be like the godfiends that were born at the beginning of primal chaos, mimicking millions of constellations and forming a starry sky within the body.”

Lin Yun was dumbfounded when he heard that because he didn’t think the Profound Sky Canon was so terrifying.

“Aside from that, Tian Xuanzi also created many martial techniques from the Profound Sky Canon.”

“Isn’t this a little too unbelievable?” Lin Yun was shocked.

“It’s not at all unbelievable. A completed dragon spirit martial technique is terrifying, not to mention that the Profound Sky Canon was a martial technique recorded on the Ancestral Dragon Monument.” Mu Chuan briefly paused before he continued, “In the same realm, Feng Jue naturally can’t defeat Jin Jue, who reached the tenth stage. Furthermore, junior brother’s comprehension is a little poor as well.”

“Doesn’t the Sword Sect have any cultivation techniques comparable to the Profound Sky Canon?”

“Haven’t you seen it already?”

“I’ve seen it?” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered before he replied, “Great Profound Sword Canon!”

The Great Profound Palace was one of the four treasures of the Sword Sect, with the Great Profound Sword Canon recorded.

“But it’s a pity that the Great Profound Sword Canon isn’t complete, since we lost the most important section.” Mu Chuan replied.

“Because of Yu Qingfeng?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right.” Mu Chuan replied. He then continued in a rather sorrowful voice, “Yu Qingfeng sliced two peaks three thousand years ago, destroying the Grand Firmament and Pellet Firmament Peaks’ inheritances. It was fine to lose the Pellet Firmament Peak, but the Grand Firmament Sword Sutra was an important section of the Great Profound Sword Canon. The Great Profound Sword Canon is also recorded on the Ancestral Dragon Monument and has a higher ranking than the Profound Sky Canon.”

Everyone in the Sword Sect hated Yu Qingfeng deep in their bones, and Lin Yun also had complicated feelings. He had asked Yu Qingfeng about it, and the latter said he had no grudges against the Sword Sect. Lin Yun could tell that he was even filled with respect for the Radiant Sword Saint.

“What’s above dragon spirit?” Lin Yun changed the topic.

“Divine spirit, it’s something we can’t imagine at our level, and martial techniques on that level have long become legends. So you don’t need to care about that.” Mu Chuan smiled. “It’s good enough if a powerful sect has several high-grade ghost spirit martial techniques. As for dragon spirit martial techniques, they’re all incomplete. But Tian Xuanzi relied on his talent to complete the entire Profound Sky Canon.”

Lin Yun recalled that clone he faced back at the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Even if they were enemies, Lin Yun had to admit that Tian Xuanzi was a real monster.

“Junior Brother.” Mu Chuan looked at Lin Yun and briefly hesitated before he continued, “Master didn’t want me to tell you this, but I feel that you should know about it. It has been nearly twenty years, and few people still remember it.”

Those words made Lin Yun’s heart tense because he could roughly guess what Mu Chuan was about to tell him.

As Mu Chuan’s expression became stern, he said, “You roughly guessed it. I will tell you why Jian Jingtian was expelled from the Sword Sect back then!”
