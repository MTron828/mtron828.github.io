Chapter 1856 - Unforgivable

On the way back to Heavenly Domain City, Lin Yun naturally chose to ride on the Sacred Alliance’s saint-class warship together with the other Quasi-Saints. To be honest, Lin Yun didn’t want these people to come with him and wanted to find an opportunity to sneak away halfway. But these people were determined to send him back to Heavenly Domain City.

Thus, this naturally caused some trouble for Lin Yun. After all, he couldn’t stay in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion any longer after this. Two months have passed since his six months agreement with Lil’ Purple, and he had to go to the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“I say, what happens if you can’t take out the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown later?” Lin Yun asked Gu Jun as the four of them stayed in the same room. Gu Jun was smart to shift the pressure of the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, but none of the Quasi-Saints were stupid. This was why they were determined to deliver Lin Yun back to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion to ensure that no one would take the opportunity to leave with the crown.

“We’ll see as we walk. Don’t tell me you’re planning to take it for yourself?” Gu Jun smiled.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word, and Gu Jun continued, “I advise you to let Saint Elder keep it. If it’s on her, no one will dare to place any idea on the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.”

Mei Zihua and An Liuyan also curiously looked over because the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown was their biggest gain on this trip to the Black Tortoise Void Sea, and it was too precious. Now that everyone knew about it, there was no doubt that Lin Yun would draw great trouble for himself if he wanted to keep it.

Lin Yun turned to look out the window. The saint-class warship was speeding through the seventh layer of heaven, and the scenery through the window became distorted.

“I have to find a chance to leave.” Lin Yun said.

“I’m afraid it’ll be difficult. We’re in the seventh layer of heaven, and even those in the Samsara Edict Realm won’t be able to last long outside, not to mention it’s impossible for you to leave silently on this ship.” Gu Jun said. “It won’t be easy, even if you change your appearance, not to mention it’ll be troublesome if someone finds out.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Young Master, what are you worried about?” An Liuyan had meticulous thoughts, and she could tell that Lin Yun wasn’t worried about the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.

After a brief pondering, Lin Yun nodded his head, “Don’t you remember that there are still two people in the Starry Sky Secret Realm? Not to mention that the Wind Edge Lord died in the Black Tortoise Void Sea, and the Liu Saint Clan definitely won’t let this matter rest.”

The Wind Edge Lord wasn’t the same as Yu Wenxiu. Yu Wenxiu was just the disciple of a Quasi-Saint, but the Wind Edge Lord was the successor of the Liu Saint Clan and received nobility from The Empress. The Liu Saint Clan was one of the four ancient saint clans in Heavenly Domain City, and they definitely received news that their successor died in the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

“Young Master, you don’t have to be too worried about that. No one saw that you killed the Wind Edge Lord, and it’ll be fine as long as none of us say anything about it.” An Liuyan comforted.

“I’m actually not too worried. If I had been worried, I wouldn’t have killed him back then. I’m more concerned about those two we met back then, instead.” Lin Yun smiled. He had an ill premonition on the saint-class warship, but he couldn’t figure out where this ill premonition came from. After eliminating all the possible factors, he could only place it on the two who entered the Starry Sky Secret Realm. After all, he could already foresee the Liu Saint Clan’s revenge, and he did not need to have an ill premonition about it.

Since he had an ill premonition, it must be something he didn’t know about. He had no idea if the white-clothed man and woman were friends or enemies.

“That woman is really terrifying, not to mention we coincidentally boarded the same Black Tortoise Ship. Her understanding of the Black Tortoise’s inheritance isn’t any lesser than mine…” Gu Jun said fearfully.

“Don’t care about her for now. I must find a way to shake off everyone when we get to the pier.” Lin Yun said. He had decided to leave the moment they got off the warship, and he had a high chance of leaving if he was alone.

“I also have to find a way to deal with this mess.” Gu Jun said, gulping down wine.

The rest of the journey was quiet as Lin Yun spent his time meditating in his room. Lin Yun had a rough gauge of his strength through the battle with the Fire God General. Without using any external force, he could fight those at the third stage of the Profound Death Stage, and he could barely face those at the fourth or fifth stage.

Now that he had reached the tenth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, his dragon pulses have reached a limit of thirty thousand feet. This allowed him to cross the Profound Life and Profound Death Stages. Aside from that, there were also some surprises because he discovered that he could make a breakthrough to the Profound Life Stage anytime he wanted.

He had yet to digest the three cups of Demigod Wine, and it wouldn’t take long for him to make a breakthrough. Furthermore, his breakthrough would be smooth without any obstacles when he made a breakthrough to the Samsara Edict Realm.

Thinking about it here, Lin Yun knew the bitter times had passed, and it was time for him to welcome the sweet times. After all, each breakthrough in the Dragon Pulse Realm was dangerous, especially when he made his breakthrough to the tenth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm; it was no different from a life-and-death experience.

But fortunately, that was only a test of the Black Thunder Martial Emperor. Even if he were reduced to ashes, as long as he kept the sword in his heart, the Black Thunder Martial Emperor would revive him and even grant him an even more powerful physique.

Lin Yun carefully inspected it multiple times, and his Divine Dragon Bone and Profound Wither Key were still around; he didn’t suffer any loss. It was a miraculous experience, and Lin Yun even wondered if the black tortoise aura left behind in the tribulation contained a wisp of time-space dao.

Half an hour later, Lin Yun was awakened by An Liuyan.

“Young Master, we’re here.” Lin Yun opened his eyes and saw a gentle smile on An Liuyan’s face. This naturally made Gu Jun and Mei Zihua envious.

Heavenly Domain City had four piers, corresponding to the four major districts. It might be a pier, but it was no smaller than an island, and the size was even bigger than ordinary cities.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun stood up, and they got off the warship. When they jumped off the warship, Lin Yun noticed that the pier was empty. The usually bustling streets were empty without a single person.

“Young Master, something isn’t right.” An Liuyan whispered.

Lin Yun nodded his head. Even a fool could tell that something wasn’t right, naturally making Gu Jun and Mei Zihua furrow their brows. This meant that someone had sealed off the entire pier. Could it be that something happened to Heavenly Domain City?

Lin Yun had many speculations in a split second, and the holy lands’ geniuses and Quasi-Saints were also surprised that the pier was so empty.

“Not a single person?”

“This is weird. There are some things left on the ground. This means that there should’ve been people here around half a day ago.”

“Yeah, just look at those wine jars. There is still wine in them. Not to mention the footprints are pretty fresh as well.” Everyone looked around and was surprised.

“There’s no need for everyone to panic. We cleared the pier four hours ago. We have some questions for the champion of the Nirvana Banquet. We have no intention of targeting anyone else.” Right then, a group of people appeared on a roof. The leader of this party was a blue-clothed youth, and the aura he gave off was at the pinnacle of the Profound Death Stage.

Two Quasi-Saints were standing beside him, and they didn’t bother concealing their cultivation. Aside from that, there were many Profound Death Stage cultivators behind them, and this massive scale made everyone take in a cold breath.

“It’s the Liu Saint Clan!”

“What are they trying to do here? What did Lin Xiao do for the Liu Saint Clan to come with such a massive scale?”

“The person who spoke seems to be the elder brother of the Wind Edge Lord, Liu Chen!”

“Something huge probably took place.”

Amidst the commotion, Liu Chen swiftly appeared before everyone and the large group. His face was gloomy, and he looked at Lin Yun with murderous intent flashing within his pupils. He asked in a deep voice, “Lin Xiao, did you kill my younger brother, the Wind Edge Lord?”

His words immediately caused an uproar. After all, the Wind Edge Lord was one of the four young masters of Heavenly Domain City, not to mention that the Wind Edge Lord was even conferred personally by the Empress. Just that alone meant that he was the successor of the Liu Saint Clan.

An Liuyan immediately retorted, “Liu Chen, the Wind Edge Lord might have some feud with Lin Xiao, but don’t spout nonsense. You have to give evidence for everything!”

“You want evidence?” Liu Chen asked with an eerie smile. “I’ll give you the evidence, then. Bring that piece of garbage out!”

A figure was tossed out from behind Liu Chen. This person was covered in injuries with horror on his face. When Mei Zihua and Gu Jun took a closer look at this person, their faces changed because this person was Cheng Tong, who was on the same Black Tortoise Ship as them.

Aside from Lin Yun, Gu Jun, Mei Zihua, and the mysterious woman, Cheng Tong’s group of three was also on the ship. Gu Jun immediately knew that they were in trouble.

Liu Chen waved his hand and grabbed Cheng Tong’s head, “Cheng Tong, tell everyone what you saw back then.”

Cheng Tong’s face was distorted in pain, and he looked at Lin Yun in despair before crying, “Brother Lin, I have no choice… My two brothers are in his hands…”

The surroundings fell silent, and the Quasi-Saints all realized that the Liu Saint Clan had come prepared.

Liu Chen coldly looked at Lin Yun, and asked, “Lin Xiao, let me ask you a question. Do you recognize this person? If you say you don’t, then I’ll kill him for slandering you.”

The faces of Xiao Yuanqi, Gu Jun, and An Liuyan changed because that was no different from moral kidnapping. Everyone’s eyes also involuntarily fell on Lin Yun.

As Lin Yun raised his head, he said, “Let him go. I did kill the Wind Edge Lord, and there’s no need to implicate others in this matter.”

Everyone was surprised when they heard that because they didn’t think Lin Yun was so straightforward. Wasn’t that the same as courting death? The Liu Saint Clan’s purpose was evident by sealing off the entire pier and bringing two Quasi-Saints over.

“Hahaha! You have guts!” Liu Chen laughed, and he strengthened his grip on Cheng Tong’s head, snapping his neck. Then, he coldly said, “Since you two know each other, this person is your accomplice then, and he’s also unforgivable!”

This scene startled everyone, and they involuntarily took several steps back.

On the other hand, fury blazed within Lin Yun’s heart, with his pupils filled with murderous intent.
