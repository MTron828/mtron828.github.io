Chapter 1969 - Reflect On Yourself (1)

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was enveloped in a dazzling saint radiance, and her actual appearance was revealed.

This made Lin Yun take a deep breath to calm down. He said, “Senior, you must be joking.”

“Is this the Radiant’s lineage? Daring to do and not daring to admit?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint sneered.

Lin Yun wondered what his master did to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. He bitterly smiled, “Martial Aunt, I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

“Still trying to feign ignorance?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint sneered, “Is that what Jian Wuming taught you? If you still refuse to admit it, I’ll kill you right now!”

A majestic murderous aura descended from the sky, and this struck a massive blow to Lin Yun’s Divine Tortoise Transformation, with signs of collapsing any moment now.

“Martial Aunt, you can just kill me if you want,” Lin Yun said.

A saint sword flew over without warning, and the tip was about to point at Lin Yun’s eyes the next moment. Lin Yun sensed it with his Azure Dragon Sword Heart but didn’t avoid the sword or blink his eyes. When the sword stopped, it was only a few centimeters away from his eyes, and an ordinary person would’ve been scared to death.

Time seemed to have stopped, before the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint waved her hand and summoned the saint sword back.

This naturally relieved Lin Yun, and he said, “Thank you for sparing me.”

“I’m not sparing you; I’m just trying to confirm your identity,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. “Ye Guhan did have a close relationship with Ye Qingtian, and he was the one who pleaded for Ye Qingtian back then. That was the reason why I didn’t take his life. But I’ve seen him before, a year ago, and he had a motive for sneaking into the Celestial Pool.”

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that. He didn’t expect that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint knew about it.

“A person’s talent can accumulate, and their cultivation can even skyrocket. But did you know that there’s something difficult to change?”

“I don’t know.”

“The desire to live. Ye Qingtian had a lot of concerns in his heart, and he would do anything to survive, even if he had to suffer humiliation,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. “But you’re not a person like that, and there’s no one like that in the Radiant’s lineage. I already guessed your identity when you wrote down the four words back then, not to mention Ye Guhan has been hiding from me. This only further confirmed your identity in my heart.”

Lin Yun’s gaze changed, but he said nothing about it.

“Carry on and hide yourself. I can’t be bothered to expose you, just like how I couldn’t be bothered to expose Jian Wuming back then,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said with a cold flicker within her pupils. This was her pride as a swordsman. She continued, “From today onwards, you will stay here to practice the sword.”

“How long do I have to stay here for?”

“Let’s discuss it after you master the thirteenth sword form.” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint basked in the saint radiance again, becoming deep and unfathomable. She took out a paper and started writing on it with her brush as the saint radiance gathered from the surroundings.

Six ink figures flew out from the paper, wielding a sword, and charged at Lin Yun. This was the same teaching method as the Radiant Sword Saint, except that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was more ruthless. The six figures all executed the Divine Firefly Sword, with Astral Sword Intent and their cultivation at the Nirvana Stage.

When he landed on the ground, Lin Yun soared to the sky, surrounded by six figures. He wasn’t bothered, initially, but he soon began to silently complain.

But a brief moment later, sword wounds were left on Lin Yun’s body, and the Astral Sword Intent contained in the attacks made Lin Yun grit his teeth in pain. Even with two saint physiques, the pain still made Lin Yun grimace.

But the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint wasn’t bothered with that and continued to write with her brush. The inked figures changed their sword techniques. It was still the Divine Firefly Sword, but they executed the second, third, and fourth sword forms.

Even with the Azure Dragon Sword Heart warning him, Lin Yun couldn’t react quickly enough, increasing his injuries. The entire plaza was enveloped in sword rays.

Lin Yun had pushed the Divine Sunchasing Art to the limit and practically divided himself into six. But he still couldn’t face the incoming attacks, and the Flower Burial Sword was knocked away when the six inked figures executed the seventh sword form. The six inked figures had surrounded him, sealing him from all directions and instantly immobilizing him.

“Is this the level of Radiant’s disciple?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint mocked as she stopped writing.

Lin Yun was naturally unconvinced and even wanted to bring out the Azure Dragon Sword Heart. But when he raised his head, he bumped gazes with the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and could see the latter’s playful gaze. It was as though the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was saying she was waiting for him to expose his identity.

But Lin Yun’s temper also rose, and he knocked an incoming sword away. He bore two swords head-on before the Flower Burial Sword flew over and blocked the remaining swords.

“Is this the best the Heavenly Jade’s lineage has to offer?” Lin Yun smirked. But his smile soon disappeared as the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint lowered her head to write on the paper.

When the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint wrote on the paper, the inked figures continued to execute the Divine Firefly Sword. When they executed the twelfth sword form, Lin Yun was covered in wounds and fell onto one knee.

“What about the last sword?” Lin Yun squinted his pupils. After all, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had yet to execute the thirteenth sword form—Myriad Swords Unite.

“We’ll continue after resting for half a stick of incense,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, letting Lin Yun rest for half a stick of incense time before she repeated the cycle.

By sunset, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had repeated the Divine Firefly Sword nearly a hundred times, but she didn’t execute the thirteenth sword form—Myriad Swords Unite.

This made Lin Yun suspect that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint wasn’t here to teach him but to take revenge on him on behalf of his master. If the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was willing to teach, she should’ve taught him the thirteenth sword form since Lin Yun already mastered the twelve sword forms.

“We’ll continue tomorrow,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, soaring to the sky and disappearing.

Lin Yun took a deep breath, but he didn’t ask much. He sat on the ground with his legs crossed to treat his injuries. After all, he wasn’t someone who would admit defeat so easily.

The next day, all the swordsmen gathered within the Solar Jade Palace. Today was the day the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint would give a lecture to everyone, and no one dared to be late.

Over the past two days, they have gained a lot from the three words left behind by the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. Wang Yue approached Chen Zhong and asked, “Have you seen Ye Qingtian?”

“No.” Chen Zhong shook his head. Ye Qingtian would naturally become the center of attention if he were here, and it was impossible for him not to take note of Ye Qingtian if he came.

“That’s weird. Where did he go?” Wang Yue asked. He initially wanted to invite Ye Qingtian but couldn’t see the latter anywhere. He couldn’t even see Ye Qingtian after coming to the Solar Jade Palace.

“Don’t worry about it. He’ll come,” Chen Zhong said.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Wang Yue looked at the surrounding swordsmen and muttered, “I wonder why Martial Aunt suddenly placed such great importance on this Sword Assembly. She never paid any attention to it in the past.”

Chen Zhong smiled, “The Heavenly Dao Sect’s previous ranking was low. After all, we’re not a sect of swordsmen, so Martial Aunt probably couldn’t stand it any longer.”

“Perhaps,” Wang Yue casually responded, but he was looking around and couldn’t find Ye Qingtian anywhere.

He wasn’t the only one, more people were noticing that Ye Qingtian couldn’t be found anywhere.

“Where is he?” The Ye Clan became doubtful when they couldn’t see Ye Qingtian anywhere after arriving early.
