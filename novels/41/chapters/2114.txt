Chapter 2115 - Attempting To Subdue

“He’s dead?” Lin Yun looked at the dead Orangeclothed Venerable. Who said that an expert wouldn’t lay their hands on the younger generation? If that person didn’t have someone backing them up, it wouldn’t matter who killed them. But if it was someone like the Blood Moon Divine Son, even if he didn’t have a Great Saint behind him, his senior brother should have some reservations about it.

“Let’s go.” Ye Guhan smiled as he grabbed Lin Yun and soared to the sky. Compared to Zhao Tianyu, who left by becoming transparent, Ye Guhan’s method was more overbearing and crude. He was like a sword piercing through the rocks, charging out of the mountain with Lin Yun.

While Lin Yun took a deep breath, he saw the mountain trembling violently, with many hills on the verge of collapsing. But something wasn’t right because crimson moonlight had enveloped this entire region with a blood moon hanging in the sky.

Beneath the blood moon, Zhao Tianyu was standing behind a black-clothed Great Saint. This Great Saint was terrifying, and the blood moon was a phenomenon that he had created. The blood moon was strange because it looked similar to his Azure Dragon Sword Heart, but the range was much bigger. The area within a hundred mile-radius was shrouded in the crimson moonlight. Only the region around Ye Guhan and Lin Yun was spared from the moonlight since they were enveloped in sword rays.

“Brother, let’s go!” Ye Guhan greeted the black-clothed Great Saint with a smile before he tore apart the crimson moonlight with a sword and turned into a sword ray, disappearing into the distance. It didn’t take long for Ye Guhan and Lin Yun to disappear before Zhao Tianyu.

Although Zhao Tianyu was feeling aggrieved, he could understand why his guardian didn’t chase after them. Even the black-clothed Great Saint wasn’t confident about dealing with a sword dao Saint Sovereign like Ye Guhan, and the black-clothed Great Saint would have been worried about Zhao Tianyu’s safety if he fought with Ye Guhan.

Zhao Tianyu’s emotions fluctuated for a long time before he calmed down.

“Muyan is right. Ye Qingtian might become a threat if we’re careless,” Zhao Tianyu said calmly.

“Let’s go with plan two, then. We can leave the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear with him for now. Without the secret technique, he won’t be able to fully control it,” the black-clothed Great Saint said.

“Damn it!” Zhao Tianyu squinted with a chill flashing across his eyes. He had a feeling that since he couldn’t kill Ye Qingtian back in the cave, he wouldn’t have another opportunity in the future. The fact that Ye Qingtian could withstand his Divine Lightning Eyes empowered by greater dao while being at the Nirvana Stage was enough to prove his monstrous talent.

“Let’s go. We’ve caused a great commotion here.” The black-clothed Great Saint looked in a direction and left with Zhao Tianyu.

“Senior Brother, why are you here?” After returning to the Heavenly Dao Sect, Lin Yun removed the Silver Moon Mask and sighed in relief. His injuries had healed, but his face was still pale because the power of the Divine Lightning Eyes was frightening.

“Since the Blood Moon Divine Son has a guardian, you naturally have one as well. Since your master in the Heavenly Dao Sect isn’t free to do that, I’ve become your guardian,” Ye Guhan smiled.

Upon hearing that, Lin Yun felt warmth in his heart, and he smiled, “You also came with me when I went to the Hidden Sword Manor?”

“The Hidden Sword Manor? No. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint had gone there, so I didn’t join the fun.” Ye Guhan took a Divine Dragon Fruit and began chewing it before Lin Yun.

“Didn’t they say guardians aren’t allowed to participate if it is a conflict amongst the younger generation?” Lin Yun asked.

Ye Guhan smiled, “There’s that saying, but that’s utter bullshit. I won’t move if you can beat him, but how can I watch you being bullied when you’re already on the verge of death? You must remember that only we can bully others within the Eastern Desolation and not vice versa. Beat him up if you can beat him. But if you can’t, your senior brother will help you. If your senior brother can’t do it, you still have your master within the Heavenly Dao Sect. If even the Dragon Origin Great Saint can’t do it, we can call the two mistresses along.”

Lin Yun widened his mouth upon hearing that. He had a feeling that something wasn’t right somewhere, but it also made sense at the same time.

“Don’t tell me that you think that you’re fortunate that you’re not beaten to death when you’re so arrogant, right?” Ye Guhan smiled. “Without anyone protecting you, you would have been killed long ago.”

Lin Yun quickly changed the topic. He asked, “What’s the origin of the Divine Lightning Eyes? My sword intent dissipated upon coming in contact with it, and I didn’t feel such a great pressure even when facing the Whiteclothed Venerable, who grasped a greater dao.”

This was his first time encountering this situation, and he couldn’t help having lingering fear when he heard that. His sword intent was his greatest reliance. If his sword intent dissipated, he could not face a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase, even if his cultivation was at the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

Ye Guhan took a hard bite out of the Divine Dragon Fruit with enjoyment on his face. He smiled and explained, “The reason is simple. Don’t think too much about the saint dao. You can just treat it as an amplifier. It can amplify martial intent. Since it can amplify, the larger the base, the larger it would be after being amplified. Do you understand now?”

Lin Yun instantly figured it out after listening to Ye Guhan’s explanation. He replied, “The Whiteclothed Venerable’s martial intent is inferior to the Blood Moon Divine Son. So even if it’s amplified by saint dao, the power is different.”

“That’s right.” Ye Guhan nodded as he wore a gratified expression. Ye Guhan stripped saint dao of the profundity and explained with the simplest method, “Most importantly, even if the Blood Moon Divine Son wasn’t at the Quasi-Saint Realm, he can already face your sword intent with his lightning intent and Divine Lightning Eyes. So after being amplified by saint dao, the gap between you and him was instantly widened. If the two of your martial intent are at level nine, he will reach two or three times under the empowerment of saint dao, reaching level eighteen or level twenty-seven. How are you going to fight him then?

“The Whiteclothed Venerable’s martial intent is only a four at best, and it’s still weaker than you even after being amplified. So you can naturally defeat or even kill him.” Ye Guhan sighed, “Sometimes, even if the gap is small, you might never be able to catch up in your lifetime.”

“I understand,” Lin Yun said.

“You really understood?” Ye Guhan asked with a playful smile.

“I do.” Lin Yun nodded. It was just like his fellow classmates in his previous life. They were all at the same level before the university entrance examination. However, after the examination, the difference of a few points might mean the difference of universities, which were amplifiers. Different universities would have different amplification factors.

After four years in universities, someone might receive a monthly salary of 3,000 while some might receive 10,000. The difference was at least three times. The difference would widen as time passes, and it might be impossible to catch up in your lifetime.

That was the same for martial cultivation. If you accumulate more at the Nirvana Stage, your strength would be further amplified after reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm.

Just when Lin Yun was going to return to the Indigothunder Peak, Ye Guhan said, “By the way, your master is back. After you’ve completely recovered from your injuries, remember to visit him. He…”

“The Dragon Origin Great Saint?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up. He remembered the Serene Dust Great Saint saying that the Dragon Origin Great Saint went to a forbidden ground within the Eastern Sea to search for the Divine Blood Fruit to perfect Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

“Yeah. He’s back from the Divine Dragon Grave.”

“Is he alright?” Lin Yun asked.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ye Guhan merely smiled, not knowing how to reply. The Dragon Origin Great Saint was a little pitiful. He boldly said, So what if I can’t return? Although he returned, the situation was a little complicated.

“He’s actually been back for a long time, but…” Ye Guhan smiled. He carried on, “Forget it. I’ll just tell you straight away. He’s back, but his state isn’t that good. He was tricked by a Black Tortoise within the Divine Dragon Grave and nearly went all out. But he was ganged up on by a group of old men and was trapped there for half a month.”

Lin Yun widened his mouth and was speechless. He had a Divine Dragon Fruit, and he had been keeping it. So there was no need for the Dragon Origin Great Saint to suffer so much.

“What’s the matter?” Ye Guhan asked, looking at the changes on Lin Yun’s face.

“It’s good that he’s fine. I’ll visit him after recovering from my injuries.” Lin Yun coughed. He didn’t tell Ye Guhan that he possessed a Divine Dragon Fruit. It was better for him to privately tell the Dragon Origin Great Saint about it. If his senior brother knew he had a Divine Dragon Fruit, he would probably immediately mock the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint suffered so much on this trip to the Divine Dragon Grave; it was best for him to keep it to himself for now.

“There must be something weird about you. Hurry up! Go and treat your injuries.” Ye Guhan sent Lin Yun away. He didn’t mention the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear and considered it Lin Yun’s spoils.

After returning to Indigothunder Peak, Lin Yun treated his injuries with the Blue Dragon Bone. It didn’t take long for him to completely recover. But he wasn’t in a hurry to enter the Iris Secret Realm to check on the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear. Instead, he began to recall his fight with the Blood Moon Divine Son, trying to figure out a method to deal with the Divine Lightning Eyes.

Ye Guhan said that he couldn't compete with the Blood Moon Divine Son before reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm. But after he analyzed, he believed that he should have been able to withstand that attack with the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal, even if his senior brother didn’t show up. The second variation of the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal, Inverting Yin-Yang, had touched the surface of space dao, and it should be enough for him to resolve Zhao Tianyu’s attack. Once he resolved Zhao Tianyu’s attack, he could have used the Azure Dragon Sword Heart to simulate a sword domain before bringing out his dual sword stars and blocking the subsequent attacks.

“There’s no need to be so pessimistic. At the very least, it shouldn’t be a problem for me to leave safely.” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered. The Astral Sword Intent was the most important thing because he hadn’t reached the pinnacle of complete mastery in it.

His sword intent was strong, but he was still one step away from reaching the pinnacle of complete mastery. So he decided to reach the pinnacle of complete mastery before the Blue Dragon Record appeared. After thinking about it, Lin Yun entered the Iris Secret Realm.

As soon as Lin Yun came in, a dazzling radiance made Lin Yun shut his eyes. This radiance was being given off by the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear, enveloping the entire Iris Secret Realm in a golden layer, including the Phoenix Tree.

Lil’ Purple was observing the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear but was cautious and didn’t come into contact with it.

“Empress, do you think that what my senior brother said makes sense?” Lin Yun asked as he came over.

Lil’ Purple contemptuously sneered, “What does a tiny Saint Sovereign know about? Saint dao isn’t as trifling as he said, and the Divine Lightning Eyes isn’t a simple number game. If Zhao Tianyu has enough opportunities, he can transform it into the God Eyes of Destruction, one of the eight eyes from ancient times.”

Lin Yun smiled, knowing that he shouldn’t have asked.

“Don’t worry about that for now. See if you can have the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear acknowledge you as its master. This is a powerful weapon, and you’ve picked up a treasure this time.” Lil’ Purple said in excitement as she stared at the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear with a scorching gaze.

“Is it possible?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s dangerous, but it’s worth a try. You have to be prepared,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun took a deep breath, his expression becoming grave. He was nearly killed by the Golden Lotus Flametree back then, so he couldn’t underestimate it now that it had turned into the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear.
