Chapter 1086 - Crude Yet Meticulous

“Luo Qingxu, congratulations on making a breakthrough. I’ll be leaving with this brat now!” Feng Jue chuckled. After reaching his cultivation, it was hard to make a breakthrough. But he could make a breakthrough any time he wanted and the reason why he chose not to was that he wanted to make an improvement in his sword path.

“Go on,” smiled Luo Qingxu. “It’s good for the Sacred Alliance that he can be recruited by the Sword Sect. After all, it would be embarrassing for the Sacred Alliance if such a genius isn’t recruited by anyone.”

It would be embarrassing for the Sacred Alliance if the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path wasn’t accepted by a sect. After all, they had followed their ancestral teachings to give the geniuses from the lower realms a chance in Kunlun Realm.

It was fine if Lin Yun wasn’t a transcendent genius, but he was. They would become a laughingstock if Lin Yun amounted to nothing after the Heavenly Path. In reality, the various sects were starting to disregard the Sacred Alliance, and the powerful sects weren’t even interested in the Heavenly Path. They were more concerned about the Divine Blood Fruit, and the Sacred Alliance naturally knew what they did behind their backs.

Take the Ninth Heavenly Path, for example. The fairness of the Heavenly Path had been destroyed because of the ten Realm Sons. Who knows how many geniuses were suppressed by the ten war realms and died before they had a chance to display themselves. Only Lin Yun managed to make it out of this entire ordeal.

If he didn’t show up, the outcome in the Ninth Heavenly Path would have been ugly.

Hearing that Feng Jue wanted to take him away so quickly, Lin Yun spoke out, “Seniors, can you guys give me some time to bid farewell to my friends? Furthermore, I have something that I’ll like Senior Luo to help me with.”

Feng Jue was briefly stunned when he heard that and laughed, “Looks like I was so anxious to help that I forgot about this. But you’re from the Sword Sect now, so I will be the one to help you. According to Sword Sect’s ancestral teachings, disciples of the Sword Sects disciples aren’t allowed to accept any favors, benefits, come in contact, or form alliances with someone from the Sacred Alliance. Just remember that.”

They have rules like that?

“Hmph, don’t scare the juniors. Lin Yun, you’ve yet to join the Sword Sect. Tell me what you need.” Luo Qingxu glared at Feng Jue before waving his hand. Boundless energy enveloped Lin Yun and pulled him towards the ship.

Feng Jue became curious about what Lin Yun was trying to do. He had yet to join the Sword Sect, and he was already coming in contact with the Sacred Alliance. Without any hesitation, he also flew towards the ship, thinking that he would teach Lin Yun a lesson if he did anything he was unhappy with.

When Lin Yun landed on the ship, Feng Jue appeared beside him. The sword intent he was giving off was immense even though he retracted his aura. When he landed on the ship, he took several steps back to distance himself from Lin Yun.

Lin Yun became curious. Didn’t Feng Jue say that those from the Sword Sects weren’t allowed to come in contact with the Sacred Alliance?

“Feng Jue, you were kicked out of the Sword Sect, right?” Luo Qingxu smiled and asked.

“Ah?” Lin Yun was surprised to hear that.

“What is there to be curious about? The ancestral teachings cannot be disobeyed, and they can only expel me since I have to come in contact with the Sacred Alliance,” said Feng Jue.

Lin Yun wasn’t stupid, and he knew that there must be a reason why the Sword Sect went this far to recruit him.

“Let’s ignore him. Lin Yun, what help do you need?” Luo Qingxu smiled. Unlike Feng Jue, his aura was retracted and gave off an amicable aura.

Although Lin Yun had no expression on his face, he was all ears. However, Feng Jue was unhappy. If Lin Yun asked for help that was beyond Luo Qingxu, he would have to teach Lin Yun a lesson.

Wearing a grave expression, Lin Yun took out the Flame Dragon’s Heart that he extracted from the Imperial Feather Realm Son. The heart was filled with vitality and surrounded by golden flames. Only one seal had been unlocked on the heart, but the aura it emitted was still terrifying.

Looking at the Flame Dragon’s Heart, Feng Jue couldn’t maintain his composure anymore. He knew what Lin Yun was trying to do. This brat is really going to give the heart to the Sacred Alliance? Feng Jue couldn’t stand by while this happened.

But he ultimately bore it in to see what Lin Yun was trying to do. Then, Lin Yun took out the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit that shone with rainbow radiance and dense spiritual energy. No one could tell what Lin Yun was doing.

Feng Jue was also shocked to see the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit and finally decided to stop Lin Yun.

“I would like to request senior give this Flame Dragon’s Heart to my friend, Luo Chen, in secret,” said Lin Yun.

Listening to Lin Yun’s words, Feng Jue was shocked because he never expected that this was Lin Yun’s motive. Even Luo Qingxu was surprised and hesitated, “Are you sure about that? Even if you don’t use the Flame Dragon’s Heart for yourself, you can also use it to swap for better treasures.”

“No need. I’ve thought it through. Luo Chen has suffered a lot because of me,” said Lin Yun in a decisive tone.

Seeing that he couldn’t persuade Lin Yun about it, Luo Qingxu replied, “Since you’re made up your mind, then I won’t try to persuade you. This is nothing for me, and it can’t be considered helping. But fusing with the Flame Dragon’s Heart is dangerous, and you might not necessarily be helping him.”

“It all depends on his choice,” replied Lin Yun. He naturally knew about the dangers of fusing with the Flame Dragon’s Heart, but there was a reason why the Heavenly Path wasn’t dangerous to every genius. Those who lacked courage were lacking opportunities.

Feng Jue turned to look at Lin Yun and fell into deep thoughts. Lin Yun might seem arrogant on the outside, but he was unexpectedly generous to his friends. After all, the Flame Dragon’s Heart even tempted Luo Qingxu.

However, Lin Yun had given it out without any hesitation. He knew that giving this to Luo Chen publicly would put Luo Chen in danger. So he had to get Luo Qingxu for help.

“Also, I’d like to ask Senior Luo to help me give these leaves to my friends,” said Lin Yun while he removed the nine leaves on the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit. He could save the flower for himself to make a breakthrough in the Empyrean Realm. The second act made the face of everyone on the ship change. After all, the value of the leaves weren’t inferior to the fruit.

“Alright.” Luo Qingxu nodded his head and put away the Flame Dragon’s Heart along with the leaves.

“Thank you for your help.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together. The things that he took out were extremely precious. He only made a move because he trusted the Sacred Alliance, especially since Luo Qingxu had given him a favorable impression and didn’t put on any airs before him.

“I'd like to take a short leave.” Lin Yun nodded his head towards Feng Jue and Luo Qingxu before he left.

“How is it? Hehe, what do you think of the new disciple of our Sword Sect?” Feng Jue smiled, erasing the stern face he had on previously.

Luo Qingxu didn’t mention Feng Jue’s changes and replied, “He’s crude, yet meticulous. He’s completely unlike my initial impression. He might be proud, but he isn’t arrogant. Only he could defeat all ten Realm Sons. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Listening to Luo Qingxu’s praises, the smile on Feng Jue’s face grew even denser. “Of course. After all, he’s someone that my master wanted. In the future, he will become my junior brother.”

Everyone on the ship wore a shocked expression. After all, they all knew who Feng Jue’s master was, a super powerhouse who hadn’t accepted any disciples in years. Did someone like him really want to take Lin Yun as his disciple? Just what was Lin Yun’s origin? After all, it made no sense for Lin Yun to draw the attention of that person if there was nothing special about him.

According to what Luo Qingxu knew, not even the heaven-defying geniuses or geniuses from saint clans caught Feng Jue’s master’s attention. There was clearly a story that wasn’t being explained. However, Luo Qingxu smiled and didn’t ask about it. Then, he pointed ahead towards Lin Yun who was heading toward Yue Weiwei and Chen Xun, “Looks like he went to look for that lass.”

“I’ll have to make a trip over in case he gets snatched away,” said Feng Jue anxiously with a chilling smile on his face.

“You better hide that temper of yours a little. Why are you going to interfere in the conversation between two lovers?” Luo Qingxu squinted his eyes and placed his hand on Feng Jue’s shoulder.

“I-Is there any problem in me going to take a look?” Feng Jue replied awkwardly.

“Haha, just wait here patiently.” Luo Qingxu laughed.

Along the way, Lin Yun nodded his head toward Luo Chen’s party before he continued towards Yue Weiwei. Seeing Lin Yun’s arrival, Chen Xun tugged his arms together and smiled, “You guys talk.”

But just when he wanted to leave, Lin Yun turned his gaze over, “Not now.”

“Big Brother Yun?” Yue Weiwei became nervous when she heard Lin Yun’s unfriendly tone.

“Is there anything?” Chen Xun also turned to look at Lin Yun with an unfriendly gaze. After all, he wasn’t a pushover and he also had quite the temper. If it wasn’t for Yue Weiwei, Lin Yun would’ve already been a dead person by now.

Ignoring Chen Xun’s gaze, Lin Yun questioned coldly, “Let me ask you something. Why didn’t you do anything in WInd Mound City?”

Chen Xun was clearly in the Heavenly Path, but he allowed Yue Weiwei to be humiliated.
