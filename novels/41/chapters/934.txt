Chapter 935 - What Can You Do? I’ll Be Taking Your Life Then!

A golden pillar suddenly enveloped Lin Yun as he soared into the sky. At this moment he looked like a sun because of the boundless brilliance he was emitting. Not only was he emitting light, but he also emitted heat. He was so hot that the surrounding astral energy started to heat up.

“Light of the sun…” Kong Xuan, who had brought out his advanced fortune martial technique, started to get worried when she saw the golden brilliance. With his keen senses, he could see the ancient seal in Lin Yun’s palm that contained terrifying power.

“An imperial fortune martial technique! How did this fellow manage to cultivate an imperial fortune martial technique!” Kong Xuan’s heart rippled with powerful waves because it was a huge risk to practice an advanced fortune martial technique, not to mention an imperial fortune martial technique.

Lin Yun had completely surpassed his expectations. However, an idea suddenly dawned on Kong Xuan. Lin Yun must have gotten the technique during the fight for the Glorysun Spirit. When Kong Xuan thought about this, he started to feel envious. He could tell that Lin Yun’s technique was weird, so it had to have a huge origin.

However, he didn’t believe that Lin Yun could unleash the full power of the technique. This meant that there was an opportunity lying in wait for him.

The fire in Kong Xuan’s eyes grew even more ferocious because he never would have thought that killing Lin Yun would help him so much. Out of greed, he started circulating his origin energy frantically to produce a powerful attack.

When the punch was about to reach Lin Yun, Lin Yun’s golden brilliance pierced the sky. It truly looked like the brilliance of the sun was peeking through the clouds.

“Divine Sunbreaking Seal!” Lin Yun roared and threw his punch out. This was the first time he ever unleashed all of his power ever since reaching the first soul. At this moment, the sun was clashing with the fist of the crimson giant.

The sound of space shattering echoed out as many weak cultivators in Flamecloud City were sent flying. Then, cracks started to form on the surface of Lin Yun’s sun. As the shattered golden radiance rained down, the ground was filled with countless craters.

“You’re ultimately a fool. You’re destined to burn out like a comet. It’s a waste for you to obtain such fortune…” Kong Xuan sneered because his guess had been confirmed. There was no way Lin Yun could fully unleash the might of an imperial fortune martial technique with his cultivation. In the end, Lin Yun’s mysterious technique was destined to go to him.

The onlookers were deeply shocked by the clash. By the looks of it, Lin Yun was in a disadvantageous position.

Lin Yun’s face slightly changed when he saw the outcome of his attack. However, the Divine Sun Breaking Seal wasn’t that simple. As the sun continued to shed its shell, the ancient seal underwent nirvana and shined even brighter than before. It now looked like a genuine divine sun.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun’s hand started to change as he roared indifferently, “Radiance of the Sun, Eternal Glory!”

A gigantic winged human appeared behind Lin Yun. As it unfolded its wings, it completely covered up the sun. At the same time, the radiance from the ancient seal grew violent as an unrivaled aura pierced through Kong Xuan’s Bloodbone Demon Palm.

The crimson giant’s punch had shattered into tiny fragments. However, Lin Yun’s attack wasn’t done. The golden brilliance then shot towards the crimson vortex that Kong Xuan created.

Before Kong Xuan could even utter a word, the crimson vortex suddenly exploded. Only then did the winged human behind Lin Yun go dim. All of the spectators went silent as their throats became too dry to make a sound.

“You bastard! You actually injured me?!” Blood dripped down from Kong Xuan’s lips as killing intent blazed out of his eyes. “How can a piece of trash from the lower realm like you possess such an advanced fortune martial technique!”

Forcefully stabilizing his injuries, Kong Xuan appeared before Lin Yun and unleashed another attack. By his actions, he wanted to take Lin Yun down before Lin Yun could recover.

“How ignorant.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with ridicule because the exhaustion was nothing to him. After all, his foundation was built with 1,500 divine astral pellets. Before Kong Xuan could even approach him, Lin Yun pushed a palm out with azure dragon breath, “Flamecloud Incinerating Palm!”

The seals on his palm were accompanied by a dragon roar as a gigantic black dragon claw enveloped in black flames flew out of the clouds. Kong Xuan might be fast, but there was nothing he could do to face the dragon claw head-on.

When Kong Xuan hit the dragon claw, he felt like he hit an invulnerable wall. Letting out a groan, Kong Xuan went flying as his hair became disheveled. The spectators couldn’t believe that Kong Xuan suffered such a huge loss.

“You bastard!” Kong Xuan completely lost it as he dashed towards Lin Yun without a second thought. At this moment, he no longer held back his cultivation. Throwing out hundreds of punches in a single breath he tore the dragon claw to pieces.

Kong Xuan was so fast that everyone was caught by surprise. It almost looked like the dragon claw shattered as soon as it made contact with Kong Xuan.

“Die!” After he was done destroying the dragon claw, Kong Xuan threw another punch.

Lin Yun let out a groan when the dragon claw shattered because this was the first time he had run into such a powerful enemy. However, he stayed calm and released his immortal spiritual sword intent.

His violent sword intent manifested into an azure dragon that coiled around him to provide protection. When Kong Xuan’s punch landed on the azure dragon, it created a crater on the body of the azure dragon. His punch was fast and ruthless, but it felt like it was traveling through quicksand. Kong Xuan realized that he couldn’t even touch Lin Yun.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun clenched his fist together as his vitality and origin energy merged together. With a punch, he was able to leave fine cracks on the crimson light enveloping Kong Xuan.

Both Lin Yun and Kong Xuan were surprised. They were surprised at their opponent’s strength. Kong Xuan was especially surprised because he never thought that Lin Yun would be so strong. After all, Lin Yun didn’t even use a martial technique to destroy the origin energy that surrounded him.

The attacks continued and all of the surrounding walls started to crumble. The majestic ancient walls were no different from paper.

At this moment, Kong Xuan was enveloped in a crimson armor that he created with his aura. With a shout, he attack, “Bloodbone Star Breaking Finger!”

A crimson beam shot out of Kong Xuan’s finger that caused cracks in the air. As it flew, it caught Lin Yun by surprise. Not having many options, Lin Yun executed the Divine Flicking Finger.

Countless Iris Flowers started to bloom behind him as Kong Xuan’s crimson beam landed on his sword aura. The sword aura showed signs of melting under the assault of the crimson beam, but it didn’t actually disappear.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with surprise. Clearly, Kong Xuan knew how tough it was to destroy his sword aura, but he was still trying to do it.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In Kong Xuan’s mind, he only needed three breaths to beat Lin Yun’s sword aura. However, even though Lin Yun’s sword aura was suppressed, it managed to shatter Kong Xuan’s origin energy and pierce his shoulder. Kong Xuan wasn’t fazed by his injury and started to laugh instead.

Lin Yun’s sword intent started humming and he realized that he couldn’t mobilize his sword intent. The crimson beam had merged with his sword aura. Essentially, Kong Xuan sealed Lin Yun’s sword aura with his own.

“Lin Yun, I told you I was going to make you pay for humiliating my Bloodbone Realm!” Kong Xuan started laughing because victory was within his sight.

Lin Yun tried a few times and realized that it would be troublesome for his sword aura to break free of its restraints. However, he didn’t panic. “You think this is enough to make me pay? Why are you smiling when I haven’t even drawn my sword?”

Suddenly, Lin Yun’s sword box opened up and countless flower petals flew around him. Grabbing the Flower Burial Sword, he unleashed Lightning Cocoon.

As soon as Lin Yun drew his sword, the crimson beam restricting his sword aura crumbled. At this moment, his sword ray shined so bright that the world looked dim. Lin Yun’s breathtaking sword left all of the spectators shocked. Slowly, they recalled Lin Yun’s claim of only needing one sword to kill.

It became a lot easier for Lin Yun to unleash the Three Heavenly Divides after reaching the first soul. So he unleashed a total of nine sword silk threads that burrowed their way into Kong Xuan’s body. Before Kong Xuan could even respond, his body exploded into a bloody cloud.

Did Kong Xuan die just like that? He was on the Azure Dragon Ranking!

“Hahaha!” A burst of laughter came from the cloud of blood. When the blood dissipated, Kong Xuan appeared once more, but this time he was topless. The armor that he once wore was broken into tiny fragments that littered the ground. Apparently, Kong Xuan relied on a defensive dao artifact to survive.

“They said that you only needed one sword to kill, but I’m still here. There’s nothing you can do to me!” Although Kong Xuan relied on his armor to survive, he still thought he had the capital to laugh. However, while he laughed, a red line appeared on his forehead that started to move down his body. Just like that, Kong Xuan laughed and his body split in half.

When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, an Azure Firmament Tree appeared behind him with Iris Flowers in full bloom. Additionally, petals were scattered across the lake behind him in the shape of lotuses.

Since Kong Xuan couldn’t be killed with one sword, Lin Yun just used another. He knew that sooner or later, the Three Heavenly Divides would take Kong Xuan’s life.
