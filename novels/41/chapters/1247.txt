Chapter 1248 - Sword Sect's Humiliation

Crimson light flew out of the flames burning on the altar and were absorbed by Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Physique. It was a similar sight to when he absorbed the divine dragon aura.

With a dragon roar echoing from his body, lightning covered Lin Yun. Then, a violent wind gathered at Lin Yun’s forehead. At the same time, a terrifying aura swept out from Lin Yun as his azure dragon aura began to grow along with the number of dragon runes.

This terrifying phenomenon lasted for four hours before it finally died down. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, dragons could be seen in his pupils. Meanwhile, his gaze emitted a terrifying dragon aura. A brief moment later, Lin Yun let out a long sigh.

“Seven hundred?” Lin Yun checked the amount of dragon runes he had and was shocked. But when he turned around, his face changed drastically. He couldn’t help wondering why the crimson lights appeared after making it through the Nine Li Illusion Realm. It was especially strange since the light contained ancient and divine vitality that was similar to the divine dragon aura.

After a long time of thinking, Lin Yun felt tempted to examine the altar closely. Even after passing all nine levels, it felt as though he was barely touching the surface of the altar. It was like there were boundless secrets waiting to be excavated still.

Shaking his head, Lin Yun collected his thoughts. He didn’t expect that the number of dragon runes would reach 700. He initially thought that it would be hard to take another step after attaining 500 dragon runes from the divine dragon aura. After all, the divine dragon aura wasn’t something that he could encounter often.

At this moment, Lin Yun activated the dragon runes on his arm. Then, a violent power filled his body and his muscles began to swell up from the power harbored within his body. When all 700 dragon runes reached his palm, Lin Yun raised his hand.

“Azure Dragon Grab!” Lin Yun roared as the dragon runes formed a terrifying vortex in his palm. The vortex was a combination of gold and purple that represented wind and lightning. As the terrifying thunderstorm energy spiraled, cracks began to appear in the surrounding space.

When Lin Yun clenched his fist, the surrounding space shattered. But the space he shattered was only the beginning of the attack. The vortex continued to spiral in Lin Yun’s palm and thunderstorms began to spread out. When lightning flew out from his fingertips, the entire sky turned dark.

“So this is the true power of the Azure Dragon Grab?” Lin Yun smiled as he recalled how powerful it was when the Azure Dragon Lord used this move back then.

“Disperse!” Lin Yun spread his hand apart and the vortex dissipated. This was a secret technique that allowed him to use this move as he wished. It was just as he had expected, everything was futile compared to absolute strength.

In the past, it was a pipe dream for him to control this move as he wished. But it was easy now that the number of dragon runes reached 700. If it was this terrifying with 700 runes, how strong would it be when it reaches a thousand?

Lin Yun’s eyes began to flicker as he sorted out his newly obtained trump cards, the Azure Dragon Battle Armor and Azure Dragon Grasp. There was also the Divine Firmament Sword Intent and the Song of the Phoenix.

Finally, there was also the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. However, it was still greatly restricted due to his cultivation and he could only give it a try after reaching the Astral Stage or the Elysium Core Realm.

Right at this moment, a bolt of lightning descended down from the sky. This newcomer was Jian Jingtian, but Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by his arrival because the latter probably knew that he came out of the Nine Li Illusion Realm.

“Where’s Senior Brother Feng?” Lin Yun asked when he didn’t see Feng Jue around.

Jian Jingtian looked at Lin Yun deeply and smiled, “Don’t bother. Your senior brother is broke thanks to you, and he’s feeling pretty pitiful.”

Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he heard that because Jian Jingtian was even more ruthless. After all, didn’t Jian Jingtian con Feng Jue?

“I’m only concerned about him. What the hell are you thinking?” Lin Yun asked.

“Haha. I feel that he doesn’t need your concern. I also know that your Silver Moon Mask came from him as well. You’re even more ruthless than me!” Jian Jingtian sneered.

“I didn’t… Don’t accuse me of something I’ve not done!” Lin Yun said.

Jian Jingtian smiled, “The Sword Sect’s disciples have come. So your senior brother went over to take a look.”

Lin Yun was stunned when he heard that. The Sword Sect? Looks like the Profound Wither Island was pretty tempting that even the disciples of the Sword Sect came. This also meant that the other powerful sects must have come. As the overlord of the Ancient Barren Domain, the disciples of the Profound Sky Sect should be here too.

“Why aren’t you going?” Lin Yun asked. As a subsidiary force of the Sword Sect, it made no sense that Jian Jingtian didn’t go over to meet them as the sect master of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“They’re all from the Scarlet Firmament Peak. I can never like them,” said Jian Jingtian with disdain before his eyes turned dim.

Seeing that Jian Jingtian had such a personality, Lin Yun asked, “Which peak were you from back in the day?”

“The Divine Firmament Peak,” said Jian Jingtian. When he looked at the doubt on Lin Yun’s face, he explained, “There are nine peaks in the Sword Sect, named after the nine heavens. The Divine Firmament, Scarlet Firmament, Emerald Firmament, Azure Firmament, Profound Firmament, Indigo Firmament, and Golden Firmament. The Scarlet Firmament Peak belongs to the sect master, and the master of the peak is the sect master. Many disciples from various clans end up on that peak.”

When Lin Yun counted, he realized that Jian Jingtian had only mentioned seven peaks. He then asked, “What about the two other peaks?”

“They were leveled to the ground 3,000 years ago,” Jian Jingtian sighed. “It’s the humiliation of the Sword Sect. The disciples today only know about the existence of the seven sects. They don’t know that the Sword Sect had nine sects back then.”

“Why are you telling me this?” Lin Yun squinted his eyes and felt that it was a secret of the Sword Sect. Perhaps he shouldn’t know about the secret.

Taking a deep glance at Lin Yun, Jian Jingtian said, “You’ll know about it sooner or later. This is the humiliation of the Sword Sect. The Sword Sect lost their title as the strongest sword-related sect since then and fell from being a holy land.”

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that because this humiliation was a little too great. Such a powerful sect had two peaks leveled to the ground and was denied their status as a holy land. This was no longer a single person annihilating a sect but subduing a holy land!

“Who did that?” Lin Yun asked.

“Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng,” said Jian Jingtian.

Shock filled Lin Yun’s heart. The Nine Emperors were so strong that a single emperor could subdue an entire holy land. What was that era like?

Seeing that Jian Jingtian wasn’t willing to talk more about it, Lin Yun changed the topic, “How much longer until the Profound Wither Island opens? How much do you know about it?”

“Half a month,” said Jian Jingtian. “The Profound Wither Great Saint was a disciple of the Southern Emperor, and many people suspect that the three treasures of the Southern Emperor were on him. But that’s bullshit because none of the other emperors would have let him live if he had them. The Profound Wither Island is an ancient ruin. Aside from the inheritance left behind by the Profound Wither Great Saint, there are still many other treasures that can be found there. The strongest treasure in the Profound Wither Island is the Great Saint Origin. But I heard that only the one with the Profound Wither Key can obtain the Great Saint Origin.”

Lin Yun’s heart trembled when he heard that. It looked like the Profound Wither Key was crucial.

Looking at Lin Yun, Jian Jingtian could instantly tell that Lin Yun was interested in the Great Saint Origin and smiled, “Only saints can refine the Great Saint Origin. Well, you have to be at least in the Samsara Edict Realm. But even if you get it, it won’t benefit you. It will only benefit the Sword Sect.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Lin Yun smiled and didn’t say anything else. After reaching the Saint Realm, one would become a saint and their body wouldn’t rot. As time passed, their cultivation would manifest into the Saint Origin. Since the Profound Wither Great Saint was in the Greater Saint Stage, he naturally had the Great Saint Origin.

If one didn’t have enough talent, they would have a high chance of becoming a saint if they accepted the test of the saint origin. Even if they failed, it would greatly boost their lifespan and cultivation.

If it was someone who was talented enough, there was a high chance that they could be promoted to a saint after refining the saint origin. As a disciple of the Southern Emperor, the saint origin left behind by the Profound Wither Great Saint was naturally a lot more precious than other saints.

Even if he couldn’t refine it, for now, it didn’t mean that he couldn’t refine it in the future. But he also knew that he would be pursued if he obtained it, which would be troublesome. So it was just as Jian Jingtian had said, he would have to hand it over to the Sword Sect if he managed to obtain it.

“Forget about the Great Saint Origin, it’s more practical to think about how you’re going to get five million divine astral pellets. You can find them in the Profound Wither Island. Don’t rely on stealing them from your senior brother. Even if you take all his wealth, he doesn’t have five million divine astral pellets,” smiled Jian Jingtian.

Lin Yun was really speechless by Jian Jingtian’s shamelessness when he heard that. If he didn’t take away seven dragon origin pellets from Feng Jue, Feng Jue might be able to exchange them for five million divine astral pellets.
