Chapter 1430 - Saints Cannot Be Humiliated

Lin Yun’s words made those who had just joined the Sword Sect cheer with their blood boiling. This was a real swordsman, and they were filled with respect for him.

On the contrary, Xiahou Yan, Chen Bing, and Huang Yancheng’s faces turned red as they knelt on the ground. They were naturally unconvinced, but they suffered severe injuries from that Divine White Dragon. Only Xiahou Yan was slightly better amongst the three because of his Innate Sword Physique, but even he was covered in blood, especially the wound on his chest. It had broken all of his ribs.

As for Chen Bing and Huang Yancheng, their conditions were even worse. Not only could they not put up a fight anymore, their meridians were even damaged.

The six saints exchanged glances before their eyes were filled with approval as they looked at Lin Yun. Lin Yun was eloquent with his words. He defeated the three but left the punishment to the saints, proving that he had genuinely accepted the Sword Sect.

“Lin Yun, well done. The sect will reward you when you join us. So, you can step down for now.” The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord said, looking at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun nodded and recalled his constellation, the holy spirit, and the azure dragon back into his body.

When the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord appeared before Xiahou Yan’s group of three, their faces changed as they felt a chill run down their spines, especially Xiahou Yan. His face was pale when he suddenly thought of something and became horrified.

In the past, he only felt that saints were strong, but he didn’t feel that much pressure from them. But when a saint stood before him today, he could feel a tremendous pressure that crashed down even when the saint didn’t release his aura.

“Xiahou Yan, what else do you have to say?” The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord coldly asked.

Xiahou Yan opened his mouth, but he couldn’t say a word. The three of them ganged up on Lin Yun, but they were the ones who were defeated. He knew that he had become an utter embarrassment after today.

“I have nothing to say.” Xiahou Yan’s lips trembled as he gritted his teeth.

“Good. You have nothing to say, but I have something to say. As a prince of the Xiahou Saint Clan, there’s a saint in your clan. So, I wonder if you know the punishment for humiliating a saint?” The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord solemnly asked.

The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord’s words made Xiahou Yan’s face pale because the thing he was terrified of ultimately came. He trembled in fear as he recalled what he said earlier when he lost control of his emotions. It was fine to win since the Sword Sect’s saints wouldn’t dare to punish him. The Sword Sect would become a joke then, so they wouldn’t have the cheek to punish him. The seniors of his clan would also stand out for him if he was punished.

But he lost, he lost miserably. Not only did he embarrass himself, he even embarrassed the whole Xiahou Saint Clan. Even if the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord killed him now, the Xiahou Saint Clan wouldn’t say a word about it.

Likewise, if someone provoked the Xiahou Saint Clan and humiliated their saint, they would only have a terrible end. So there was no way the Xiahou Saint Clan could protect him, not to mention that they couldn’t, even if they wanted to. Saint Clans and Ancient Saint Clans were different, even if they had saints in their clans; they didn’t have the same foundations.

So Xiahou Yan finally panicked with his lips trembling.

“Xiahou Yan, saints cannot be humiliated!” The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord indifferently looked at Xiahiou Yan.

Xiahou Yan’s face was as pale as paper. He replied with a trembling voice, “I-I know…”

“Very good. I won’t take your life, but you must be punished for your actions. I will abolish ten years of your cultivation. Do you have any objections?” When the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord’s voice resounded, it left the geniuses from the Xiahou Saint Clan dumbfounded.

Ten years of cultivation? Xiahou Yan was at the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm now. He hadn’t even reached the Empyrean Realm ten years ago.

“No! No! Senior, please spare me!” Xiahou Yan madly smashed his head against the ground, and it didn’t take long for his forehead to be covered in his own blood.

But the Sword Sect’s disciples didn’t have any pity for Xiahou Yan. On the contrary, their eyes were filled with contempt as they looked at him. If he knew that he would be punished, why did he humiliate the saints? They could only say that Xiahou Yan deserved it.

With ten years of his cultivation abolished, there would be no Xiahou Yan in the future because of the intense competition in the Ancient Barren Domain; Xiahou Yan would be no different from a cripple.

If he was a talent with a bright future, he would be finished with ten years of his cultivation abolished because everyone would be stronger than him. Xiahou Yan acted high and mighty in the past, stepping on many people to forge a name for himself. So one could imagine how those whom he crippled in the past would enact revenge against him.

“Forgive me! Please forgive me! I’m sorry!” Xiahou Yan burst into tears. If he became crippled, he wouldn’t even be able to return to the Xiahou Saint Clan. He would instantly fall from the position of a prince and become the center of all mockery.

“Xiahou Yan, saints cannot be humiliated!” The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord indifferently continued before putting his palm on Xiahou Yan’s head.

The pain made Xiahou Yan’s face distort as he let out a piercing scream. His cultivation began to rapidly plummet from the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm down to the Heavenly Soul Realm. But that wasn’t all, the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord destroyed Xiahou Yan’s sword intent as well, the firmament sword intent that Xiahou Yan was so proud of.

It didn’t take long for Xiahou Yan’s sword intent to plummet from firmament sword intent to spiritual sword intent, and everyone in the surroundings fell into a dead silence. The method of a saint was too terrifying, and this punishment was simply unbearable to watch.

After all, it wasn’t easy for Xiahou Yan to come this far in his cultivation and sword intent, but he was crippled now. Everyone knew there would be no Xiahou Yan in the future because Xiahou Yan would hide as for as long he could and live anonymously for the rest of his life. Everyone now understood the weight of those words; saints couldn’t be humiliated.

When the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord let go of Xiahou Yan, the latter threw out a mouthful of blood before he collapsed to the ground.

“Hahaha!” Xiahou Yan laughed maniacally. “I, Xiahou Yan, admit that I’m not strong enough today, and I acknowledge my punishment. But I’m not convinced! Why won’t the Radiant Sword Saint take me as his disciple?! I’ll make the Sword Sect regret it in the future!”

When he was done, he staggered and left. No one from the Xiahou Saint Clan went to help him, not even his younger brother, Xiahou Yun. Xiahou Yun hesitated for a moment but ultimately decided not to step forth.

After today, Xiahou Yan was no different from a disabled person and would be known as the sinner of the Xiahou Saint Clan. So anyone who was associated with him would be implicated as well.

As for Huang Yancheng and Chen Bing, they were terrified as they collapsed to the ground. They still had a trace of hope because they didn’t lose their rationale. Even when they said the results didn’t convince them, they didn’t humiliate the saints and left themselves a way out.

“I understand you two have resentment in your hearts when you’re invited here but not accepted by any of the saints.” The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord looked at Chen Bing and Huang Yancheng without much emotion on his face. “So, apart from being disrespectful to the Sword Sect, you two didn’t humiliate the saints. So I won’t indiscriminately hand down punishment.”

“Thank you, Senior!” The two breathed a sigh of relief as they cupped their hands in gratitude. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“The Sword Sect doesn’t interfere in fights amongst the younger generations, whether it’s the past or future. You two are welcome to challenge it again in the future if you guys aren’t convinced,” said the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord. The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord was impartial in handling this matter.

“Thank you, Saint Lord!” Huang Yancheng and Chen Bing quickly got back on their feet and bowed upon being allowed to stand. But they ignored what the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord said about challenging the Sword Sect because they didn’t want to kneel again.

They knew that Lin Yun would only become stronger since they couldn’t kill him today. So if they dared to challenge him again, they would only be courting humiliation.

“As witnesses, we will tell our elders nothing but the truth about what happened today when we get back.” Chen Bing said after taking a breath. He wasn’t stupid and knew that the Sword Sect let them go because of the Ancient Saint Clan behind them.

Since the Sword Sect spared them, they naturally knew what they should do. Although they would only be embarrassed even further, at least they still had their cultivation and got away with a slap on the wrist, unlike Xiahou Yan, who became a cripple. After all, having ten years of their cultivation abolished like Xiahou Yan would be no different from death.

“I will also only tell nothing but the truth!” Huang Yancheng said as well after coming to his sense.

“You two can leave,” The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord indifferently said.

Once they left, the whole commotion would come to an end, along with the Sword Sect’s test. But many people looked at Lin Yun with admiration because they knew that the name Flower Burial would spread throughout the Ancient Barren Domain after today.

“Come with me for the entrance ceremony. You guys are disciples of the Sword Sect after today.” Jue Chen smiled as he looked at everyone.

“Lin Yun, someone will bring you to meet Martial Uncle Radiant after the ceremony.” A voice resounded. When Lin Yun raised his head, he realized that the voice came from the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord.
