Chapter 1688 – That's Right. I'm Lin Yun!

Even when the other elders had yelled out, Lin Yun still dashed forth without hesitation. All the surrounding disciples were completely stumped because Lin Yun was a little too ferocious. Lifting the Thunderstorm Zither, Lin Yun used it like a brick and smashed it against Liu Feng’s face.

Who the hell did Liu Feng think he was to try and humiliate him? As the unhappiness in his heart grew, he didn’t hold back and gave the latter a few slaps. When Liu Feng fell to the ground, his entire face was swollen, and his bones were shattered. He was powerless to stand up.

The surrounding disciples were shocked because they never expected Liu Feng to lose in this manner. Mu Xueqin and the elders beside her were all surprised, especially the grey-robed elder. He managed to notice something, and wore a smile.

“Senior Brother Liu!” Several disciples who had a good relationship with Liu Feng stepped forth to help him, and they had fury on their faces as they looked at Lin Yun. When they looked at Liu Feng, their pupils were filled with heartache, and some cried aloud.

Among them, a female disciple stepped forth with her eyes reddened, “Lin Xiao, you’re too vicious. Didn’t you both agree on a competition in music dao? Why did you suddenly make a move and injure Senior Brother Liu so heavily?!”

“Competing in music dao? Did we agree on that? I don’t remember making that agreement. As for his injuries, I have already persuaded him, not to mention that I’m a barbarian, to begin with. Your senior brother was the one who said that. So, since I’m a barbarian, I should act like one.”

“Lin Yun, that’s the daughter of Elder Jiang, Jiang Wan’er.” Lin Wan transmitted her voice to Lin Yun’s ears.

Elder Jiang was the grey-robed elder who had the biggest opinion about him earlier. Now, he finally figured out the reason for this elder’s hostility.

“Father, Liu Feng is a disciple of our Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. So you have to take revenge for Senior Brother. This person is too unreasonable!“ Jiang Wan’er said.

“Interesting. How do you want to take revenge, then?” Lin Yun squinted his eyes.

“You vicious barbarian. How dare you injure Senior Brother so heavily. Someone like you should be crippled!” Jiang Wan’er looked at Lin Yun viciously.

The grey-robed elder beside Mu Xueling turned to look at the latter, “Saint Elder, we can’t keep this person. Although there was no prior agreement, it was obvious that this should’ve been a competition between music dao. If they had agreed on a martial fight, Liu Feng wouldn’t have lost so terribly. No matter what, this person has an issue with his character!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Elder Mu, we can’t keep this person!”

“He might be from the demonic path. The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion doesn’t see a person’s origin, but we can’t ensure the safety of our disciples if we take in a slaughtering madman!”

“His origin isn’t clear, and his means are vicious. Anyone can tell that he’s not a good person!” The other elders also spoke out, and Lin Yun could tell they belonged to Elder Jiang’s faction.

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion was gorgeous, like a celestial realm, but it wasn’t a family. No one would treat him this way if he was in the Sword Sect. Thinking about it, Lin Yun couldn’t help sighing.

“He did nothing wrong, so don’t try to make him guilty, albeit it’s undeniable that he’s a little vicious.” Mu Xueling said before she looked at Lin Yun, “Since I promised you, I won’t go back on my words. You can stay, if you are willing. No one can touch you if you're not, and you can leave as you wish.”

Her words immediately caused an uproar. The other elders were also shocked and couldn’t tell what Mu Xueling was thinking. She’s like an iceberg. Even Lin Yun couldn’t see through her.

But he was pretty straightforward as he winked, “Why do I have to leave? I did nothing wrong, to begin with.”

He had no intention of leaving because he wasn’t naive enough to think that the other musical houses would be better than the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. After all, there weren’t many sects like the Sword Sect.

“Okay. This matter has come to an end, then.” Mu Xueling said.

“Wait.” Elder Jiang suddenly spoke out.

“Elder Jiang, are there any other matters?” Mu Xueling turned to look at the grey-robed elder with a cold light within her pupils, making the latter feel tremendous pressure.

Elder Jiang smiled. “A small matter. I noticed that this person used the Thunderstorm Intent earlier. If I’m right, he should possess the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, and his attainment in the Thunderstorm Intent isn’t low.”

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi were stunned before their gazes fell on Lin Yun. The other disciples were also puzzled because they had yet to fathom what Elder Jiang was trying to express.

“So? What are you trying to say?” Lin Yun asked with a smile on his face.

“There’s recently someone with the same surname as you making waves around. Everyone in the Kunlun Realm practically knows about him. Coincidentally, that person also possesses the Azure Dragon Saint Physique like you.” Elder Jiang continued.

“Ah?!” An exclamation echoed from the surroundings because Elder Jiang was talking about Flower Burial Lin Yun. But could there be such a coincidence?

Everyone’s scalps became numb, and they were shocked by their own thoughts. After all, no one in the Eastern Desolation hadn’t heard Lin Yun’s name. He accomplished the unimaginable, killing a Saint Lord and a Great Saint when he was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Ever since the Darkest Era ended, there hadn’t been someone so breathtaking in the Eastern Desolation or even in the Kunlun Realm.

“He’s Lin Yun? How is that possible…?”

“Elder Jiang, what are you talking about? Are you insane?”

“But there’s a possibility if you really think about it. After all, the Azure Dragon Saint Physique is pretty rare, not to mention that he’s so young. Who knows, he might have disguised himself.” The surroundings fell silent as everyone’s gazes were directed at Lin Yun.

Even Liu Feng was surprised while being supported by Jiang Wan’er. He exclaimed, “He’s Lin Yun?!”

Jiang Wan’er was briefly stunned before she pouted, “So what if he’s Lin Yun? Even Lin Yun can’t bully Senior Brother Liu!”

“That’s impossible. Young Master Lin is a genuine musician, and his attainment in music dao far surpasses my own. I’ve seen Lin Yun. He did know some music dao, but he’s a swordsman, grasping the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent in the Dragon Pulse Realm. How can someone like him possibly have the time to practice music dao?” Lin Wan questioned.

A cold light flashed within Elder Jiang’s pupils, and he smiled, “That’s your one-sided words. If his attainment in music dao is really that great, why didn’t he use music dao to defeat Liu Feng earlier? He probably doesn’t have the guts. Not to mention that this person also knows sword intent. He might’ve hidden it well, but he can’t fool me!”

“I thought you were going to say something. Elder Jiang, you really think highly of me. I know some sword dao, and you can feel free to think that I’m Lin Yun. After all, the title Flower Burial doesn’t sound bad.” Lin Yun smiled.

His attitude made others even more uncertain as they began to doubt.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Elder Jiang was even more confident as he smiled, “You’re still too tender. Do you think you can fool everyone just because you know some disguising techniques? All disguising techniques in the world have flaws, and the various holy lands all have their own means of seeing through disguises. That goes the same for my Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion!”

“Are you really Lin Yun? You can be honest. That identity isn’t shameless; you can still have a position in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.” Mu Xueling said.

“That’s right. I’m Lin Yun!” Lin Yun smiled, shrugging his shoulders. His smile was sincere, but it made everyone else disappointed instead. After all, how would Lin Yun dare to admit to his identity so openly? Not to mention that Lin Yun had a feud with Tian Xuanzi.

One must know that Lin Yun possessed the Firmament Saint Cloth, and he would die should his identity be revealed. So who would be so stupid?
