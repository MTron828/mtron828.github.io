Chapter 1495 - Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpse

After Lan Siyu and his party set up the three arrays, they immediately relaxed. At the center of the array, Lan Siyu drank wine and said, “This place is so damn cold, and the yin aura is so strange. I wonder what’s going on!”

A white-haired old man said, “The yin aura here is similar to the one in Dragon Burial Valley, and Young Master Xie probably feels that there might be corpses of pure-blooded dragons here.”

“Corpses of pure-blooded dragons?” Lan Siyu’s eyes lit up. Xie Feng had hid something from him. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Yeah. The Dragon Burial Valley also has a similar yin aura, and the yin aura is so peculiar that it can even corrode flames and lightning. It might have been left behind after the death of a dragon clan.” Another person continued. “Doesn’t that mean that there might also be Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses here?”

Upon mentioning the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, Lan Siyu’s eyes were reflected with fear, but he soon comforted, “It’s probably impossible since we didn’t head into the depths. Don’t scare yourself.”

While they were chatting, they didn’t notice that there was a sword box on the roof of the cave. As a spatial fluctuation spread out, two figures flew out from the sword box.

The white-haired old man within the group locked his brows and exclaimed, “There’s movement!”

Lan Siyu’s face instantly became vigilant. When he activated the pendant on his chest, a ripple appeared and merged into his body. Simultaneously, he took out a saint sword and grabbed onto it with his right hand. The other guests also held their breaths as they became alert.

“We’ll stay in the array, so we don’t have to be afraid even if the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses really come…” Lan Siyu uneasily swept his gaze around, trying to comfort himself and everyone else with his words.

But while everyone was feeling uneasy, waves of black miasma surged, and everyone was shocked to discover that the three arrays were swiftly becoming dim under the black miasma. The corner of Lan Siyu’s cheeks twitched because this was too peculiar, and he quickly said, “Everyone gather around me! Don’t spread out! We have the advantage in numbers, so we will be fine!”

Someone suddenly dashed forth, and the arrays were destroyed with a punch, forcing everyone that had gathered there to scatter.

“Don’t split up!” Lan Siyu yelled in a frightened voice. He was terrified that it was a Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpse. But no one could bother with him as they were focused on fleeing at that moment.

But when they retreated, they could hear a piece of faint flute music echoing within the cave. The flute music contained boundless sword intent that instantly enveloped them. The one playing the flute was right before them, but they couldn’t get close, no matter how they tried.

Under the flute music, the sound waves were like blooming sword rays. Everyone drew their weapons. Meanwhile, Lin Yun was enveloped in moonlight as he played the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, trapping the seven in his music.

It didn’t take long for the seven to be forced to summon their constellations, but the Praise the Phoenix tune displayed a terrifying lethality in the hands of Lin Yun. Most importantly, these people still had no idea where Lin Yun was right now.

“How can the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpse possibly know how to play the flute?” The white-haired old man locked his brows together as he wore a grave expression.

He saw a gorgeous painting unfolding before him that bloomed like a magnificent flower. It didn’t take long for all seven of them to be covered in injuries under the flute music. As a ruthless light flashed through that old man’s pupils, he charged towards Lin Yun’s direction, “He’s over there! Let’s go over and kill him!”

But when he charged out, he was instantly sent flying back under the boundless sword aura and threw out a mouthful of blood. In the next second, the flute music changed again. When Praise the Phoenix reached the last segment, the seven Elysium Core Realm experts threw out mouthfuls of blood; they all suffered internal injuries under the music.

“Kill him! He must’ve exhausted much of his astral energy from playing the music!” Lan Siyu nervously said while holding onto his sword, forcing two guests to slowly approach Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun merely drew the Flower Burial Sword and streaked across them, instantly tearing them apart. He didn’t even turn back; one sword was all he needed to kill them. This made Lan Siyu widen his eyes in disbelief because he couldn’t believe that two human beings were gone just like that.

Without hesitation, the remaining five fled for their lives. When Lin Yun caught up to them, the middle-aged man had no choice but to turn back, seeing that he couldn’t escape. The middle-aged man had used some sort of secret technique to significantly boost his cultivation. This made him unbelievably powerful and his punch was accompanied with a sonic boom.

But facing his attack, Lin Yun didn’t panic and allowed the attack to land on him. After the dragon runes appeared on his body, the punch only made him briefly stop. It wasn’t even able to make him take half a step back.

This made the middle-aged man feel shocked, and he muttered, “H-How is this possible? Who the hell are you? Why do you know of a dragon clan’s body-refining technique?!”

But Lin Yun didn’t say a word and swung his sword. This caught the middle-aged man by surprise. Each of Lin Yun’s sword swings corroded his astral energy. Three swings later, the middle-aged man’s astral energy was eroded to the point of having none left, making him feel a terrifying chill down his spine.

Facing Lin Yun’s fourth swing, he couldn’t avoid it and was cut into two. But Lin Yun didn’t stop there and quickly chased after the group. These people were injured by his flute, and they couldn’t put up any resistance against him after he drew his sword.

The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra could manipulate nether energy, containing the profundity of death. This was much more peculiar than the demonic cultivator’s baleful aura. When Lin Yun was determined to kill, these people couldn't escape from him.

When sparks flew, the six remaining guests of the Netherworld Hall lost their lives, leaving behind Lan Siyu, who was fleeing for his life. He wanted to know what was going on right now, but the screams that resounded one after another dispelled his thoughts.

But when he saw the light before him, he immediately rejoiced because this meant he was saved. Right then, a woman with a voluptuous figure appeared before him.

“Envoy An, what are you doing here?” Lan Siyu was surprised upon seeing An Liuyan and stopped. But he soon looked worried and nervously said, “Envoy An, you must quikly leave with me. There’s a Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpse right behind us. So leave with me if you want to survive!”

But An Liuyan inwardly snickered and sneered, “Young Master Lan, you’re a really good person. I clearly heard you tell Xie Feng not to touch me earlier.”

“You!” Lan Siyu was startled, but he soon realized something and looked back. He saw Lin Yun slowly walking over while taking off the Silver Moon Mask, revealing his face.

“Lin Tian!” Lan Siyu immediately gritted his teeth. “So, it’s the two of you!”

“Are you a direct descendant of the Lan Clan?” Lin Yun asked.

A wisp of hope flashed within Lan Siyu’s pupils, and he quickly said, “That’s right. I’m a direct descendant of the Eastern Desolation’s Lan Clan. You should’ve heard of me before. Let me go, and I’ll give you unimaginable benefits!”

“Benefits?” Lin Yun muttered to himself. If Lan Siyu were a genuine descendant of an Ancient Saint Clan, his decision to kill him wouldn’t be wrong because it would be troublesome if what he did today leaked out.

“That’s right! I can find any treasure that you want!” Lan Siyu let out a breath of relief. His identity as an Ancient Saint Clan’s descendant was pretty useful. Not even the demonic sects’ experts would dare to carelessly touch him. But he was still afraid of Lin Yun, a ruthless person. But just when Lan Siyu let his guard down, Lin Yun’s Flower Burial Sword flashed, slicing Lan Siyu’s pendant into two.

“You!” Lan Siyu became furious. But before he could say another word, Lin Yun’s Flower Burial Sword created a bloody hole in the center of his brow.

After Lin Yun sheathed his sword, he searched through all the corpses’ interspatial pouches and interspatial bracelets. He had to admit that their wealth was shocking. They had millions of divine astral pellets, ten bottles of saint pellets, and many saint elixirs and saint fruits that were found in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.

Lin Yun raised his head as flames started blazing within the cave. An Liuyan had turned all the corpses into ash. She used some sort of ice-attributed flames to freeze them before turning them into pieces with a light touch.

An eerie aura swept into the cave right then, and the yin aura suddenly became cold. An Liuyan landed beside Lin Yun, and she nervously said, “Don’t tell me that there really are Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses here.”

Recalling the terrifying rumors about the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses in the Dragon Burial Valley, An Liuyan’s pupils flashed with fear. After all, they were so powerful that not even the top-tiered experts of the seven demonic sects could deal with them.

“I’m not too sure about that.” Lin Yun softly said. “But this cave is strange. There must be dragon bones here, even if there aren’t any Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses. This place is too dangerous. You should leave first. I’ll go and see if I can rescue Xiao Yun and see if there are any dragon bones along the way.”

“I’m afraid we won’t be able to leave now.” An Liuyan’s face turned pale because a pair of crimson pupils were eyeing them from the darkness.
