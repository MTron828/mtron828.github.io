Chapter 2167: Thousand Plume Great Saint

Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple after hearing what she said, and couldn’t help smiling. Only Lil’ Purple dared to say that Su Ziyao had a bigger head.

“Alright, stop moving. I’ll be done tying your hair soon.” Lin Yun helped clean the dirt off Lil’ Purple’s face before tying her hair into a braid. He asked, “You actually found the Iris Flower? Where did you manage to find it?”

The moment Lin Yun mentioned it, the unhappiness disappeared from Lil’ Purple’s face, and she snorted, “Hmph. That’s because I have my own methods. The Iris Flower has intelligence. Not only can it fly around, but it can even control lightning. Even a Quasi-Saint might not be able to subdue it.”

She had a smug face as she spoke about it. But she sighed, “It’s a pity that there wasn't any phoenix blood. Otherwise, I could try and make a breakthrough to the Saint Realm.”

“Phoenix blood… Do you think the Divine Phoenix Mountain has it?” Lin Yun asked.

“I’m not sure. I've never visited the Divine Phoenix Mountain before, and I don’t know what kind of location it is,” Lil’ Purple said. “But the Divine Phoenix Clan did have a group of humans possessing phoenix blood guarding them. They guarded and supported us for generations. In return, we bestowed them with phoenix blood and phoenix inheritances. So they can be considered our fellow clansmen.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“I’m curious. Where are all the pure-blooded divine beasts in the Kunlun Realm? Like true dragons, divine dragons, and qilins? Can it be that they fell after that ancient battle?” Lin Yun asked.

Lil’ Purple said, “I recovered some of my memories from the Myriad Demon Peak. Many pure-blooded divine beasts don’t belong to the Kunlun Realm, and most of them came because of a promise they made. I might not have been born in the Kunlun Realm, either. Maybe they left after that battle. After all, there aren’t any deities in the Kunlun Realm, but perhaps only the Iris Sword Saint knows the reason why.”

Lin Yun had seen the Iris Sword Saint before at the God Burial Mountain Range. Although it might be a remnant soul that was left, it still gave him a great shock. If the Iris Sword Saint was still alive, Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how powerful he had become. Was he related to the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity or was he the inheritance of the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity? There were many mysteries.

“Let’s go back to the Heavenly Dao Sect for now.” Lin Yun recollected his thoughts and carried Lil’ Purple back to the Heavenly Dao Sect’s direction.

“Not waiting for Su Ziyao anymore?” Lil’ Purple looked a little embarrassed, but rhen she continued, “I also didn’t want to disturb you two. You didn’t tell me about it, so you can’t blame me for it.”

“Who’s blaming you? She has her own affairs to manage, and it’s already great that she could come visit me,” Lin Yun smiled. He was calm with relief in his eyes. His emotions were suppressed earlier, but he was in a good mood now after meeting Su Ziyao. The guilt and pressure he felt disappeared.

Lin Yun didn’t dare to face Su Ziyao head-on because of An Liuyan’s matters. But Su Ziyao had her own pride and dignity, which dismissed his concerns. Despite having such a close relationship, he didn’t have many opportunities to meet Su Ziyao. On the other hand, he experienced too much with Yue Weiwei, and they were long familiar with each other. As for An Liuyan, she helped him too much, and Xin Yan took great care of him when they were in the Profound Amber Realm.

He initially wanted to tell Su Ziyao about them and leave his life in her hands, but Su Ziyao’s words made him feel ashamed and relieved at the same time. She had already borne great pain being so close to him, so why would she mind that? Since she had fallen for him, she would naturally live with him till death. If she didn’t love him, she wouldn’t bat an eye at him, even if Lin Yun went down on his knees and confessed.

“Scumbag, what are you smiling at?” Lil’ Purple asked curiously.

“Not telling you about it,” Lin Yun smiled.

Lil’ Purple immediately became furious with her curiosity piqued, and she kept asking him about it. But Lin Yun merely laughed it off and wouldn’t tell her, making her furious.

Outside the God Burial Mountain Range on the other side, Bai Lixuan and Drifting Goblet stood side by side, waiting for Su Ziyao’s return.

“Who’s Ye Qingtian? The Ninth Princess treats him too well…” Bai Lixuan couldn’t help asking Drifting Goblet. He had a feeling that Drifting Goblet definitely knew something.

Drifting Goblet smiled, “Great wine, and An Liuyan is pretty interesting to give us the Millennium Flame.”

“Drifting Goblet, aren’t you furious about this? The Ninth Princess helped him multiple times, and even helped his woman this time. Why aren’t you furious about this?” Bai Lixuan said angrily.

“I am, and I will teach him a lesson if he doesn't give me some good wine,” Drifting Goblet said seriously.

“You’re bribed with wine?” Bai Lixuan sneered.

“He gave too much,” Drifting Goblet smiled. Back in the Great Qin Empire, Lin Yun gave him so much Monkey Wine that he couldn’t hold them with two hands. He comforted, “Don’t be angry about it. Actually, you know him.”

After all, who could be more angry than him? What Lin Yun said back in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had created a violent storm in his heart. Bai Lixuan’s grievance was nothing compared to him.

“I know him?” Bai Lixuan’s face changed, then he blurted out, “He’s Lin Yun?!”

Drifting Goblet smiled, “It has been so long, and yet you still remember him. He’s the first person that you thought of. Heed my advice, he’s a man that you’re destined to never get.”

“Only you like men,” Bai Lixuan retorted, but he had so much shock on his face, it's as if he was electrocuted. He couldn’t believe that Ye Qingtian was really Lin Yun.

Drifting Goblet might not have said it explicitly, but it was basically the same as an acknowledgment. It was no wonder why Ye Qingtian looked so familiar now.

“Lin Yun, I will catch up with you!”

“Bai Lixuan, you won’t be able to catch up to me.”

Bai Lixuan clenched his fist as he recalled what Lin Yun said to him back then, even though it was a long time ago.

“Let’s stop thinking about it now. The Demonspirit Clan is harder to deal with than the Southern Border’s Voodoo Cult and Corpse Gate. We’ll lose our lives if we’re not careful.” Drifting Goblet changed the topic.

Bai Lixuan recollected his thoughts, and sighed, “It's too much for Her Highness. She had just calmed the riot on the Southern Border, and now she is dispatched to the God Burial Mountain Range.”

For the past few years, the Blood Word Battalion had been running around, spending their time massacring others to calm the threats of the Divine Dragon Empire, and each enemy was a tough opponent. Su Ziyao would always take the lead, and her prestige in the Blood Word Battalion was formed by how she slaughtered her way through mountains of corpses.

But Bai Lixuan could tell that it wasn’t a perfect solution since the roots weren’t uprooted. The more they killed, the more enemies there were. The more they killed, the stronger their enemies became, and the situation didn't become better.

Drifting Goblet felt the same way, and said, “The Southern Emperor died too early. Many powerful enemies weren't gotten rid of back then, and the Divine Dragon Empire was established in a hurry back then. There were many hidden dangers left behind three thousand years ago. The enemies and holy lands weren’t wiped out back then, and we’re now paying the price for being short-sighted three thousand years ago.”

“You’re unhappy with it?” A cold voice resounded when Su Ziyao quietly appeared, donning a black robe and a bamboo hat.

“We pay our greetings to Your Highness!” Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan quickly went down on one knee.

“Get up,” Su Ziyao said. After hearing what she said, Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan heaved a sigh of relief, especially Drifting Goblet whose face had almost stiffened.

“You drank again?” Su Ziyao asked as she stepped forth.

Drifting Goblet immediately became nervous, but he smiled with alcohol on his breath, “Your Highness, you must be joking. Why would I dare to drink when the battle is right before us?”

As soon as he finished, he gave out a burp since he drank too much alcohol back then.

Su Ziyao calmly reached out for Drifting Goblet’s wine jar, which made Drifting Goblet subconsciously pull his hand back. He smiled, “I really didn’t drink any alcohol.”

“I’ll drink it for you,” Su Ziyao said.

The moment Drifting Goblet heard that, he became even more nervous because Su Ziyao was frightening when she drank alcohol.

Snatching the wine jar, Su Ziyao wasn’t in a hurry to drink it, but asked, “Have you guys found the tracks of the Blood Moon Demonic Son?”

“We didn’t. That fellow is too cunning, and he no longer showed himself after we arrived. We previously speculated that he might show up for the Blue Dragon Record, but he was nowhere to be seen,” Drifting Goblet said. “We only found a few branches, but we’re not sure which branch he’s located in.”

As long as the Demonspirit Clan and Blood Moon Sect didn’t collude together, they wouldn’t be able to create much ripples. But the moment they colluded, it would become troublesome.

“We’ll kill our way through one by one since we’re not sure which branch he's in. We’ll start tonight. They’re too arrogant.” Su Ziyao gulped down the Millennium Flame, and her eyes flashed with terrifying murderous intent.

“Roger that!” Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan quickly acknowledged Su Ziyao’s order.

Two days later, when Lin Yun returned to the Heavenly Dao Sect, his fame within the sect had caught up to the Dao Yang Holy Son after the end of the Blue Dragon Record. It wasn’t exaggerating to say that the era of the Eastern Desolation’s Twin Stars has come to an end, and the current era belonged to Ye Qingtian.

When he came to the Indigothunder Peak, he saw the Indigothunder Quasi-Saint, who seemed to have been waiting for him for a long time.

He was happy to see Ye Qingtian with excitement on his face, and said, “Ye Qingtian, you have really brought glory to the Indigothunder Peak. Everyone is now trying to enter the Indigothunder Peak, and the resources we've received from the sect have increased. The Dao Yang Palace’s Thousand Plume Great Saint told me to tell you to pay him a visit when you return, and that he’ll be waiting for you.”

“The Thousand Plume Great Saint?” Lin Yun looked a little nervous. The Thousand Plume Great Saint’s full name was Ye Qianyu, an expert of the Ye Clan. So it would spell trouble if the latter managed to see through his identity. The only good news was that the Thousand Plume Great Saint didn’t have a good relationship with the Ye Clan, and he had another identity as the Dao Yang Holy Son’s master.

Lin Yun speculated that it might be related to the rewards the Dao Yang Holy Son spoke of.

“You don’t have to be so nervous. The Thousand Plume Great Saint has a high status in the Heavenly Dao Sect, and he can be considered one of the two with the highest authority within the Heavenly Dao Sect. He’ll surely redetermine your identity again this time,” the Indigothunder Quasi-Saint smiled. “So be prepared because you will most likely become a holy son. If you need a title, you can just call yourself the Indigothunder Holy Son.”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled because he had already refused the offer to become a holy son once. But seeing the excitement on the Indigothunder Quasi-Saint’s face, he couldn’t bear to tell him that, so he said, “Alright. I’ll make a trip to the Dao Yang Palace shortly.”

“Okay,” the Indigothunder Quasi-Saint said with satisfaction.
