Chapter 1420 - Descending Heavenly River

“Death to those who stand in my way!” Just as Lin Yun was conversing with Lil’ Purple, the Indigo Dragon Serpent that was sent flying went berserk. Not only did the humans gang up on him, but an ant who was only at the lesser Elysium Core Realm dared to stand in its way? How could it possibly take that lying down?

Most importantly, the ant in his eyes even sent it flying back, which was why the Indigo Dragon Serpent went berserk. Swinging its chains enveloped in venomous flames, it charged towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun didn’t choose to face it head-on. When the two brushed past, he executed the Divine Sunchasing Art. It brought him high into the sky while he flashed around in the air, giving him the appearance of teleporting around.

Every time Lin Yun flashed, he would release a dazzling light that lit up the entire sword mound, causing many people to close their eyes.

“You think you can escape?” The Indigo Dragon Serpent’s face became even darker as it swung its chains like a madman. Since it took on a humanoid form, it wasn’t any slower than Lin Yun in terms of speed. The venomous flames enveloping his chains made the surrounding air feel like a swamp, greatly restricting movements.

Simultaneously, it unleashed its monarch demonic aura at the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, bathing the heaven and earth with its aura, making many people feel suffocating. Under that environment, even a Heavenly Elysium Core Realm genius wouldn’t be able to last for very long.

“That fellow is pretty strong. The Indigo Dragon Serpent has yet to deal any injuries to him.” Huang Yancheng squinted his eyes with his brows locked together. This wasn’t a good sign. He wanted to watch Lin Yun get trampled by the Indigo Dragon Serpent before losing his energy. Then again, the best outcome would be the death of Lin Yun and the Indigo Dragon Serpent.

“Let’s just wait and see. He should be reaching his limit soon.” Xiahou Yan had no change on his face, as if everything was within his control.

Chen Bing stood to the side and smiled. “It’s not easy to face the Indigo Dragon Serpent alone.”

Meanwhile, not far away, the face of Jiang Cheng was dark. His gaze was disdainful when he looked at Xiahou Yan’s party. But his eyes were flickering, as though he was thinking about something.

“You want to help?” Ye Qing asked, looking at Ye Ziyun. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Brushing her fringe with a smile, Ye Ziyun replied, “Not yet, not to mention that he didn’t beg me. Let him suffer a setback so that he’ll know who’s the reliable one, or there won’t be any value in me helping him.”

She was surprised to see Lin Yun saving Ye Ziling, and this also made her unhappy at the same time. When she saw Lin Yun being targeted by the Indigo Dragon Serpent, she wasn’t worried and was somewhat happy. She was like a hunter wearing a smile, waiting for the right opportunity to make her move.

“It’s about time…” Lin Yun gauged the Indigo Dragon Serpent’s strength while he was flashing around. It might seem like he was running all around in the eyes of others, but Lin Yun wasn’t someone who wouldn’t fight a battle he wasn’t confident in. He might be arrogant, but he wasn’t retarded. This was the first time he fought a monarch demonic beast at the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. So he naturally wouldn’t clash with it head-on right from the start.

“Now, let me have some fun with you, then! Let’s see where a little snake like you got the guts to call yourself a dragon!” Lin Yun smiled and stomped his foot on the ground. As the Golden Crow Wings flapped, they unleashed a golden ripple in the air as Lin Yun charged forth.

“This…” Everyone’s hearts trembled because they never expected Lin Yun to charge over.

As everyone’s attention was attracted, Lin Yun’s astral energy unleashed his aura and circulated the eighteen Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura. He poured them into his fist before throwing a punch at one of the chains.

When the two forces collided, a visible shockwave spread out with cracks spreading over the sword mound. An unimaginable scene occurred. Lin Yun was enveloped in a saint aura as he charged forth.

The chains that even Xiahou Yan chose to avoid began to shatter under Lin Yun’s punch, and the flames enveloping the chains also scattered like fireworks.

“Run!”

“Quick, avoid it!” Everyone on the sword mound had changes on their faces, fearing that the flames would catch them.

The whole mountain range began to violently tremble with an explosion and a cloud of dust. Then, Lin Yun’s punch landed on the Indigo Dragon Serpent’s scale armor. The rebound force made Lin Yun’s body tremble, but the dragon runes on the surface of his skin began to flicker as they negated the rebound force.

Seeing that his attack was stopped by the scales again, Lin Yun wore a grave expression because the scales were tougher than his Innate Azure Dragon Saint Physique. With greed flashing through his pupils, he couldn’t help feeling envious of the scales.

The Indigo Dragon Serpent charged again, swinging its left claw out. After all, its claws were probably even sharper than many saint artifacts.

Lin Yun retreated after throwing his punch. But even so, the claw still swiftly caught up with him. The claw easily tore the dragon runes on the surface of his skin, leaving a few blood marks on his chest.

“Die!” The Indigo Dragon Serpent’s eyes flashed with ferocity as it swung the chains it was holding in its right hand. As the chains moved, it instantly enveloped Lin Yun, trying to trap him within.

“Lin Yun!” The faces of Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan changed when they saw this scene and couldn’t help exclaiming. They knew Lin Yun would be at the Indigo Dragon Serpent’s mercy if he became trapped.

The eyes of Xiahou Yan and the others coldly flashed when they saw this scene, especially Xiahou Yan, who quickly said, “That fellow is doomed!”

Ye Ziyun also became excited because she knew it was time for her to help. She had an aloof psychology toward Lin Yun, wanting to subdue the latter to become her follower. So Lin Yun was no different from prey in her eyes. She waited for Lin Yun to be in danger before stretching out her helping hand. But it was a pity that the outcome would disappoint her.

“Sword!” Lin Yun softly said. When the Flower Burial Sword flew out from the sword box, He tightly grabbed onto it. When he took a deep breath, his gaze became complicated as he looked at the sword. It had gone through multiple life and death situations with him. The Flower Burial Sword was connected to him through his heart, and it could clearly feel his emotions. So the Flower Burial Sword began to tremble when it sensed that Lin Yun’s blood was boiling.

“You too?” Lin Yun smiled. “I bet. You and I have been bearing it for a long time now.”

As the Flower Burial Sword trembled even more intensely, even the scabbard couldn’t conceal the fighting spirit being emitted as a sword vibration echoed. Since that was the case, he would just turn everything upside down.

Lin Yun’s smile was devilish as he drew his sword. When he released his firmament sword intent, a powerful sword intent soared to the sky. When the sword rays flashed, they were aiming at the chains that were targeting his throat.

“Endless Clouds!”

“Moon Courting!”

“Pricking Moon!”

“Rising Clouds!”

“Soaring White Clouds!”

“Serene Aquasky!” Lin Yun instantly unleashed seven forms of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique on the chains. All sorts of phenomena appeared with Lin Yun’s afterimages covering the entire sky, and sword rays could be seen everywhere. Lin Yun was alone, but he gave off a feeling like he was an army with all the phenomena reaching the manifestation stage.

This left everyone dumbfounded, regardless of those on the Barren Sword Mound or those outside on the stage.

“Oh my god, that’s the Aquaheaven Sword Technique, right?”

“If I remember correctly, that’s the test for the second stage, right? Lin Yun mastered it so quickly?”

“He mastered everything… That fellow is too terrifying. I can’t believe he reached the manifestation stage in every single form!”

“I thought it was only rumors!” Everyone who made it through the third stage broke out into an uproar.

“How is this possible?!” Chen Bing was shocked. He couldn’t believe what he saw. Lin Yun had turned the tables around when he drew his sword, gaining an advantage over the Indigo Dragon Serpent!

He even doubted if his eyes were messing with him; he couldn’t believe that someone could suppress the Indigo Dragon Serpent all by himself. After all, that was a monarch demonic beast at the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, while Lin Yun was only at the pinnacle of the Lesser Elysium Core Realm.

He could see dragon scales falling from the Indigo Dragon Serpent, and it didn’t take long for the Indigo Dragon Serpent to be covered in wounds. As the Indigo Dragon Serpent unleashed its retaliation, Lin Yun’s afterimages were swiftly torn into pieces, but Lin Yun’s main body was hidden in the sword aura.

This scene was too beautiful and perfect. Lin Yun was bringing the Aquaheaven Sword Technique to an unbelievable height. Aside from being too perfect, no other word could describe the current Lin Yun.

This made the Indigo Dragon Serpent even more insane, wanting to tear Lin Yun’s sword aura apart. But Lin Yun’s sword aura was as deep as a sea of clouds and became even more ferocious.

“Descending Heavenly River!” Lin Yun swung his sword out once more. But the phenomenon was different this time. A figure appeared in the sky, swinging his sword down. As that person overlapped with Lin Yun, a river of starlight was descending.

Lin Yun’s sword easily pierced through the Indigo Dragon Serpent, drilling a hole in its body. As the Indigo Dragon Serpent released a cry, surges of terrifying demonic light were being emitted from the Indigo Dragon Serpent’s body, making it look even more horrifying.

The heavy injuries made the Indigo Dragon Serpent’s body wriggle while it returned to its initial form. It was a serpent nearly three hundred meters in length. It was wailing in pain. As it flailed about, a bizarre black light was being emitted from part of the Indigo Dragon Serpent as it began devouring the surrounding sword aura in order to heal itself.

That was the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead, which made everyone’s eyes light up. The tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead was hidden within the Indigo Dragon Serpent’s body, just as everyone had speculated.
