Chapter 952 - Pet’s Might, Inferior Compared to a Cat!

Lin Yun’s voice echoed in the plaza with dense killing intent contained in his words. This made everyone briefly stunned before their eyes flashed with shock and their faces sank down.

Was this brat courting death? So he showed up to look for the Bloodbone Realm. But he wasn’t satisfied with that and even threatened all the higher realms’ geniuses here? Was he that tired of living?

These people used to stand high up in the sky. Before Lin Yun showed up, they all claimed that they would humiliate Lin Yun. But now when Lin Yun showed up, they all looked like they were the ones being wronged instead. It was as though standing high up in the sky were their rights. As for those from the Bloodbone Realm who had been enveloped by Lin Yun’s killing intent, all of their faces had long turned green.

“I insist on interfering. You stole my monarch beast core and we’re not done with that!” Mo Yan raged before Liu Mu even spoke. He had now reached the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, but his flame intent was still in the second grade. If he had the monarch beast core, he was even confident in facing the five astral spirits’ owner with his cultivation and third-grade flame intent together.

So one could imagine how much resentment he had with the beast core robbed by Lin Yun. As the immense pressure merged with his cultivation in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, this made Mo Yan look extremely terrifying and charged over the moment he was done.

Looking at Mo Yan’s attack, Lin Yun merely squinted his pupils and had no intention of fighting Mo Yan. Just when Mo Yan was about to reach him, Lil’ Red who was lying on Lin Yun’s shoulder suddenly unleashed a torrential killing intent. It only knew one thing. It would kill anyone who dared to touch Lin Yun.

Under everyone’s gaze, Lil’ Red had charged forth with its paw clenching into a punch and faced Mo Yan’s attack head-on.

“This pet is really stupid.”

“A beast is still a beast. What intelligence does it have?”

Looking at Lil’ Red charging towards Mo Yan, everyone all wore a smile on their faces. A mere pet in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm dared to face Mo Yan head-on? Even if it had a powerful bloodline, they could imagine it being killed instantly in a single exchange.

But all of a sudden, a monarch pressure emitted from Lil’ Red which instantly tore apart the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm coming from Mo Yan. When the two clashed, a rumble sounded out in mid-air as the shockwave from their attacks spread out. Then, Mo Yan was sent flying out under everyone’s shocked gaze. When Mo Yan retreated, he was like a firm mountain shaking which caused the entire plaza to start trembling.

“How is this possible?!” Everyone was shocked by this scene. All those who were mocking earlier were left dumbfounded because they didn’t expect that Mo Yan would be defeated by a pet in a single strike. When they looked at the Dragon-blooded Cat again, all of their expressions had become grave.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Where the hell did this pet come from? Isn’t it a little too exaggerated that it had the pressure of a monarch demonic beast?” Even the owner of the five astral spirits wore a grave expression because that scene earlier had dealt a great impact on them.

Someone from a lower realm actually had such a heaven-defying pet? Even the killing intent in Liu Mu’s eyes had gradually frozen. He was initially thinking that even if Lin Yun was heaven-defying, he could only die with Bloodbone Realm and Blazeyang Realm working together. But Lin Yun’s pet was a surprise that caught him expected.

“Damn it!” As for Mo Yan who was sent flying by Lil’ Red, his face became grave as he glared at the cat. Just a moment ago, he was calling out to Lin Yun but Lin Yun didn’t even spare a glance at him. He couldn’t accept that he was being forced into this state by a pet when he had gone through great dangers to get through his fourth tribulation.

“Hehe.” Lil’ Red chuckled before it charged forth and clashed with Mo Yan once more. But no matter how terrifying his flame intent, the monarch aura emitted from Lil’ Red had fully restricted him. As the fight continued, everyone was shocked to discover that the accuracy of the fat cat wasn’t any weaker compared to Mo Yan.

This meant that the Dragon-blooded Cat knew how to use martial techniques! Seeing that he couldn’t take the cat down and was forced into such a pathetic state, Mo Yan finally couldn’t hold it back anymore.

“Glory of the Sun!” Mo Yan roared as he executed the greater fortune martial technique of the Blazeyang Realm empowered by his flame intent. When he threw his punch out, the radiance from his attack instantly lit up the entire hall, so much so that even the altar had started to blaze under the radiance.

But facing Mo Yan’s advanced fortune martial technique, Lil’ Red spat out the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff and held onto it. As its blood began to boil, the mysterious runes on the staff also shone out brightly as if an ancient beast had awakened at this moment.

When Lil’ Red swung out the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff, golden brilliance converged into an Ancient Dracoape behind it which caused the surrounding space to distort under this strike. Just like that, Mo Yan’s punch instantly crumbled when it came into contact with the staff.

When his punch shattered, a trace of blood dripped out from Mo Yan’s lips and was sent flying out. Raising his head to look at Lil’ Red, he had fear written all over his face because this cat was even more terrifying than the Gold-furred Demonic Ape he faced back then. He didn’t expect that Lin Yun’s pet would be so strong.

When all the other geniuses saw how Mo Yan’s attack was so easily resolved, they could feel a chill down their spines with disbelief written on their faces. “Just what monster is that? It can even use a dao artifact?!”

“Just how intelligent is this despicable cat?”

“Holy shit, even an advanced fortune martial technique can’t resist a single strike from it?” An uproar broke out in the next moment with no one daring to underestimate the cat any more. Even those who were echoing about teaching Lin Yun a lesson had become quiet. They couldn’t imagine how terrifying Lin Yun was when his pet was already this strong.

Wiping the blood off his lips, Mo Yan roared, “All of you go up and slaughter that fat cat!”

Heeding his order, several Blazeyang Realm’s elites soared into the sky and charged towards Lil’ Red. They were smart and knew that the cat wouldn’t be able to swing such a huge staff around easily. Since it wasn’t agile enough, they could only start by surrounding it.

But just when they soared into the sky, Lil’ Red kept the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff and retrieved the Blood Viperwhip. When it swung the whip out, the whip crackled in the air like a venomous python that left behind countless afterimages. This instantly caught them by surprise and they were struck by the whip before they fell back onto the ground.

“Help out.” Liu Mu frowned because he couldn’t keep watching anymore. In the next second, the Bloodbone Realm’s elites had also joined the ranks of surrounding Lil’ Red.

“Hehe.” But Lil’ Red chuckled before keeping the whip and taking out a dagger. Then, it started to flash around and everyone could only be fooled by the cat; they couldn’t even touch the cat’s fur at all.

Watching the fight, everyone had their mouths wide open with shock. A fat cat actually took out multiple dao artifacts and fooled two higher realms’ geniuses around? Not even some higher realms’ geniuses could compete with Lil’ Red in the number of dao artifact. They couldn’t believe that even a cat had more treasures than them.

Looking at all the elites from two realms being fooled around by that cat, Liu Mu’s face had turned completely black. But just when he wanted to help out, a sharp killing intent enveloped him. Lin Yun was still looking at him and said, “It’s best for you not to interfere because your opponent is me!”
