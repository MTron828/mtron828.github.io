Under everyone’s gazes, they saw a flaming palm and sword ray colliding together in the ruins of the pavilion, forming into two massive powers with terrifying shockwaves sweeping out. When another loud explosion resounded, the blood flames and sword ray separated.

But the sword ray remained where it was while the blood flames were sent flying away. When the blood flames dissipated, it was Ao Feng who was knocked back. He took several steps back before he managed to regain his foothold on the stage. He was surprised because he didn’t expect that anyone could repel him like this.

When the sword ray dissipated, countless afterimages overlapped and revealed Lin Yun standing in the ruins. He held onto his Flower Burial Sword, standing in the ruins with his other hand behind him. With a calm expression, Lin Yun raised his head and said, “To forgive is to be forgiven. I have no feud with the Blood Moon Sect. Aren’t you guys a little too overbearing, wanting to make a move against me just because I’m the strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking and even want me to beg for mercy?”

Behind him, the three swordsmen had their foreheads covered in sweat, since they were nervous.

“Big Brother Lin, are you alright?” Yue Weiwei nervously asked. Others didn’t know about Lin Yun’s condition, but she did. Lin Yun’s dragon pulses were close to ten thousand feet, and he nearly had to undergo his tribulation when he fought the Wind Edge Lord earlier. If Lin Yun wasn’t concerned about those from the Sword Sect, he wouldn’t be here, to begin with.

“It’s fine.” Lin Yun said, shaking his head.

Ji Lingfeng and the others looked at Lin Yun deeply because no one knew better than them how powerful the Nethermoon Saint Armor was, even if Ao Feng could only bring out one-thousandth of it’s power. Ao Feng and Yan Cangming’s cultivations have also reached the limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm. This was why everyone was surprised because they never expected Lin Yun to be this strong.

“Perhaps running away isn’t a solution to the problem.” Lin Yun’s face changed, muttering to himself. He said something that no one understood while he slowly walked towards the Thunderblood Battlestage.

The strength he displayed earlier shocked everyone because no one expected Lin Yun to be so strong when everyone thought he couldn’t make it into the top three. The Fire God General Ao Feng, who won all the battles since his arrival, was sent flying away with an attack. So just how strong was the first on the Nirvana Banquet?

Instantly, everyone at the Martial Dao Tea Party, who were already feeling hopelessness, found their hope in Lin Yun, and all the swordsmen in the surroundings were filled with excitement.

“It looks like a swordsman ultimately has to stand out to clean up the mess.”

“Who said swordsmen aren’t strong? Lin Xiao is the second Jian Jingtian, turning the tables around with his sword!” All the swordsmen present were already filled with reverence for Lin Yun, considering him to be the representative of all swordsmen. So they naturally became emotional with their blood boiling when they saw him standing out again.

“Impressive, as the strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. It looks like what the Wind Edge Lord said wasn’t false.” Ao Feng snorted. He had blood-colored flames blazing on his body, and his gaze was cold.

“You still have time to concede.” Lin Yun said.

“Hahaha!” Ao Feng and Yan Cangming began to laugh. Ao Feng scoffed, “I didn’t even use 50% of my strength earlier. Concede? You can continue to dream and treat yourself as the savior. Since we’re here, we’re destined to sweep through the Eastern Desolation’s Dragon Pulse Ranking!”

Lin Yun squinted his eyes and took a few more glances at Ao Feng’s Nethermoon Saint Armor. This was a Glory Saint Artifact, and his Flower Burial Sword was also a Glory Saint Artifact. His sword had a Glorymetal Spirit within it.

He rarely used it because it caused huge exhaustion, and exposing that he possessed a Glory Saint Artifact was unwise. So he wouldn’t use it unless it was a battle he had to fight with his life on the line.

It had been half a year since he last used his sword, and he already forgot that his sword was also a Glory Saint Artifact. Most importantly, if he was too reliant on his sword as a Glory Saint Artifact, it would greatly hinder his improvements.

Recalling his gaze, Lin Yun said, “The Nethermoon Saint Armor is powerful, but being too reliant on an external object will be the same as giving up your future for the present. It’ll be meaningless even if you sweep through the Martial Dao Tea Party. In martial dao, it’s important that you’re strong, and not because of an external item.”

As mockery flashed in Ao Feng’s pupils, he scoffed, “You’re trying to teach me? Ha. What can you do to me even if I used the Nethermoon Saint Armor? You can use a Glory Saint Artifact if you want. If you don’t have one, then don’t be jealous.”

“Do you really think that the Nethermoon Saint Armor is invincible?” Lin Yun asked.

“Is it not? At least in the Eastern Desolation, I’m invincible!” Ao Feng coldly roared.

As they faced off, they released their martial intents, and a terrifying gale rampaged in the sky, causing the clouds to rumble with lightning flickering. In the next moment, they both moved at the same time.

When they clashed together, the Thunderblood Battlestage couldn’t bear the great pressure and exploded.

“Oh raging sacred flames, ignite my body and welcome the Blood Ancestor!” Ao Feng activated the Nethermoon Saint Armor, and the blood-colored radiance on the armor became even darker. Wisps of blood flames began to blaze around the armor, and each flame radiated with great power.

“I see… Not only does the Nethermoon Saint Armor strengthen his cultivation, but it can also devour the surrounding energy. Even my sword intent is also being affected…” Lin Yun could sense that his sword intent was gradually disappearing, and the blood flames blazed even more powerfully on Ao Feng. He now knew why Yi Feng lost so terribly.

“You can devour all you want. Azure Dragon Sword Intent, Azure Dragon Claw!” Lin Yun poured his Azure Dragon Sword Intent into his sword and executed the Azure Dragon Sword Art at the deification stage.

It was different from the claw manifested by his sword ray in the past. When he swung his sword, an azure dragon descended from the sky along with the Flower Burial Sword, causing a thunderstorm to rage in the surroundings.

As sword rays and blood flames clashed, a series of dragon roars echoed, followed by countless explosions.

“The sacred flames were cut?” Ao Feng squinted his eyes, looking at the result of their clash. The blood flames on him were the Nethermoon sacred flames, which came from the saint armor. Not only was it powerful, but it could even devour the enemy’s energy to strengthen itself.

He had only used nine wisps of blood flames to deal with Yi Feng. But not only was Lin Yun able to block his attack, but he was also able to resolve the attack. He realized that the devour energy seemed to be ineffective against Lin Yun.

“Very well. You have successfully made me serious in this fight.” Ao Feng soared to the sky.

Lin Yun also soared to the sky with his sword and indifferently replied, “Come at me, then. You have no advantage before me!”

“How arrogant! Don’t look down on the Nethermoon Saint Armor!” As he spoke, blood flames ignited on Ao Feng, and the blood flames even emitted a metallic luster. His physique seemed to have broken through to a new stage, becoming pure Bloodflame Saint Iron, and his dragon origin also reached an astonishing height.

“Block this sword, and you’re worthy of being my opponent!” Ao Feng coldly snorted, as the blood radiance on him skyrocketed.

“Can Lin Xiao bear it?”

“The aura from Ao Feng is already comparable to a Samsara Edict Realm expert, and his dragon pulses have reached five thousand feet!”

“Yeah. His cultivation is terrifying enough. With the Nethermoon Saint Armor empowering him, I can’t believe someone at the Dragon Pulse Realm will have such a horrifying dragon origin.” Everyone became worried when they saw the blood radiance Ao Feng gave off.

But Lin Yun simply ignored Ao Feng and took a deep breath. With a flick of his wrist, the sword stuck to his arm, and he slowly retracted his arm. Then, a horrifying dragon roar erupted from within his body, and an unprecedented sword ray burst out from his body.

In the next moment, a majestic sword intent soared to the sky. As the thunderclouds were torn apart, the layers of heaven began to shatter until the ninth layer. Boundless starlight shone down from the sky and fell onto Lin Yun, making the radiance he gave off even more dazzling.

Just by relying on his sword again, Lin Yun broke through the nine layers of heaven!
