Chapter 1896 - The Third Sword

“Ye Qingtian, is this how you pay me a visit?” The voice made Lin Yun tremble because the owner of this voice was Elder Long Yun. But how did Elder Long Yun manage to recognize him? The Mo Clan forged the Silvermoon Mask, which had a powerful disguise aside from protecting his fatal spots.

“Why are you sneaking around when visiting me? Remove your mask!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint roared.

This made Lin Yun bitterly smile before he removed the mask.

“It’s really you. I was just wondering who was so bold to disrupt my peace.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint sneered after seeing Lin Yun’s appearance. “What’s the matter? Is it so embarrassing to take me as your master that you have to sneak in while wearing a mask?”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched, and he knew that he was careless. The Dragon Origin Great Saint wasn’t sure about his identity, and yet he fell for his trap.

The two passed by a river and casually sat down. Opposite the river was a towering palace, hidden in the mist that made it seem mysterious.

“Why didn’t you remove the mask when the elders came after you?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint asked.

Lin Yun was stunned and immediately tried to find an explanation. But he suddenly realized what the Dragon Origin Great Saint said made sense. He didn’t steal anything, no one saw what he did to Zhang Yue, and he had violated no rules of the Heavenly Dao Sect. So he should’ve removed his mask when he was pursued. His current identity was Ye Qingtian, a newly conferred saint disciple, and no one would make things difficult for him.

The reason why he didn’t remove his mask was because he was guilty. If he removed his mask back then, the elders would probably stop pursuing him. In the end, Lin Yun could only devise a random excuse, “I was too nervous earlier…”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“No matter how nervous you are, you must remove your mask. What if those Quasi-Saints killed you? Or do you not want everyone to know that you’ve become my disciple even when facing death?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint then coldly asked, “Or you’re not here to visit me, and you have other motives? What are you trying to do by sneaking around in the dark?”

Sensing the terrifying aura from the Dragon Origin Great Saint, Lin Yun could only toughen his scalps and reply, “I’m naturally here to pay you a visit.”

“Good.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint’s face eased, and he asked, “You come visiting empty-handed?”

“I didn’t.” Lin Yun inwardly sighed and took out a bottle containing Demigod Wine.

“Demigod Wine?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint wasn’t bothered, initially. But when he opened the bottle, he asked in a shocked tone, “You’re really here to take me as your master?”

“Of course I am,” Lin Yun replied.

“I never expected that you’d be so generous. The Demigod Wine is a treasure, and I have only drunk it once, many years ago.”

“Let me change it,” Lin Yun said, wanting to reach out for the bottle. He still felt a little heartache about giving away a bottle of Demigod Wine. After all, he didn’t have a lot of them left.

“It’s fine.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint stowed the Demigod Wine and smiled, “Alright. You can kowtow and take me as your master now.”

But Lin Yun hesitated upon hearing what the Dragon Origin Great Saint said. He replied, “I’m here today to tell Senior that I have to ask the Azure River Sword Saint about taking you as my master.”

“Ye Guhan?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint was puzzled, and he continued, “You might have practiced his Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, but the two of you are from the same clan. It’ll mess up your seniority if you take him as your master.”

“I just want to ask his opinion because…”

“It’s fine. I’ve watched him growing up, and I can be considered half of his master. So he won’t dare to say a thing if I take you as my disciple.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint continued, “But he’s a Sword Saint now. So we’ll talk about you becoming my disciple officially again when he returns. For now, you can be considered an outer disciple of mine, and I’ll confer you the identity of my direct disciple when he returns.”

“Thank you, Senior.” Lin Yun cupped his hands and let out a breath of relief.

“Not bad… Not bad…” The Dragon Origin Great Saint laughed. “You can keep this medal with you. You might be my outer disciple now, but you will receive the treatment of a saint’s disciple as long as you hold this medal. I mainly cultivate in the Heavenly Lake, and you can find me anytime with this medal.”

Stowing the medal, Lin Yun said, “Thank you, Master. I just happen to have something to ask you about.”

“I know. You want to ask about the three azure dragon sacred flames, right? I’ll tell you about it, even if you didn’t ask me,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said.

“That’s right, Master.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint’s expression suddenly became grave, and he asked, “Have you heard before that the Heavenly Dao Sect initially has three swords? The legend isn’t fake. Aside from the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword, there’s still the Emperor Sword, which suppresses the Heavenly Dao. Others have only obtained sacred flames, became sword wielders, or obtained the inheritances left behind by the sword wielders. But the azure dragon sacred flames you obtained are related to the Emperor Sword…”

“So, where’s that sword now?” Lin Yun asked.

“It has gone missing. Long ago, the Kunlun Realm faced a huge tribulation, and the wielder of the Emperor Sword fell in the Battle of Gods. Since then, the Emperor Sword has gone missing,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said. “Ever since the Heavenly Path was severed, there were no more gods in the Kunlun Realm. Gods were extremely rare in ancient times, and the number of gods in ancient times was lesser than the number of Emperors today. Even an Emperor cannot imagine how powerful the gods are because they’re an undying existence. This means that no ordinary means can kill them. Even a god cannot kill another god so easily, but did you know that the Emperor Sword can slay gods?”

Lin Yun’s heart trembled when he heard that, and he immediately linked it with legends of the Iris Sword Saint slaying gods in ancient times.

“You should ask him why the azure dragon sacred flame is connected with the Emperor Sword and if it’s related to that person,” Lil’ Purple asked, her voice resounding from the sword box. It was directly transmitted within Lin Yun’s mind.

Lin Yun briefly hesitated and ultimately asked the question.

“You know a secret of this level?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint was surprised.

Lin Yun panicked when he heard that, fearing that the Dragon Origin Great Saint might doubt his identity. The Divine Tortoise Transformation could conceal his identity from Saints, but he wasn’t sure if it was effective against Great Saints. If the Dragon Origin Great Saint was determined to probe, he could force Lin Yun to reveal his appearance.

But the Dragon Origin Great Saint didn’t doubt his identity and asked, “There is such a legend, and that person is related to the forging of the Emperor Sword. That lord has a wide breadth of mind, and he didn’t suppress other forces aside from the Dragon Gate just because he was the ruler of the era. The treasures of all holy lands within the Kunlun Realm have some relationship with that person, and my Heavenly Dao Sect has inherited his mission to protect the Kunlun Realm. Otherwise, that sword wielder wouldn’t have participated in the Battle of Gods.

“The fact that you can obtain those three azure dragon sacred flames isn’t only because you’re talented,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said.

“What else, then? Does Master think that I have a relationship with that person? Or I’m the new heir of the Emperor Sword?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Who knows? The Ye Qingtian of the past might not, but it’s unsure about the current Ye Qingtian,” said the Dragon Origin Great Saint with a deeper meaning within his words.

Lin Yun was inwardly alarmed. He had no idea if the Dragon Origin Great Saint managed to see through his identity, and he was afraid that the latter might expose his identity the next moment.

But the Dragon Origin Great Saint suddenly said, “It’s getting late. You can return now, and I’m also tired.”

Lin Yun breathed a sigh of relief because he felt immense pressure while conversing with the Dragon Origin Great Saint. He bade his farewell and left.

But when he took ten steps out, the Dragon Origin Great Saint said, “Ye Qingtian, don’t wear a mask in the future when you’re out. There are rumors that the Blue Dragon Record will appear. If it appears, the geniuses within the Kunlun Realm will begin to appear, and a new golden era will arrive again. Your name might appear on the Blue Dragon Record if you're hard working enough.”

“I will keep it in mind,” Lin Yun replied.

“Your Heavenly Dome Sword Intent has already reached the manifestation stage, so you can pay the Celestial Purging Mountain a visit if you want to take a further step out,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said and left.

When Lin Yun left the valley, he could feel that his back was covered in a cold sweat. He never expected that the Dragon Origin Great Saint could see through his sword intent.

He didn’t know that the other party was a Great Saint during the day, and he had no reservations in his words. He even declared that he wanted to give the Dragon Origin Great Saint a beating in the future. But when he learned from the Indigo Thunder Peak Master that the other party was a Great Saint, he naturally couldn’t maintain his composure.

“The Heavenly Dao Sect is really deep and unfathomable, running into a Great Saint so casually. There are also countless Quasi-Saints, and it’s not guaranteed that my identity is being kept hidden with the Divine Tortoise Transformation,” Lin Yun sighed.

“Lin Yun, that nasty old man probably knew what you’re planning to do by wearing a mask, and he’s threatening you on purpose just so that you’ll take him as your master.” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the sword box.

“I naturally know that,” Lin Yun said. “But just think about what I wrote on Zhang Yue’s back. If he knew about it, do you think I could live? Since he’s pretending not to know about it, I can only pretend not to know anything about it.”

“Hehe. It appears he holds high regards for you, so you’re safe for now. Coincidentally, you can give the Indigo Thunder Peak Master an explanation now,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word and decided not to interact with the Dragon Origin Great Saint too often before his senior brother returned. But he had to ask around to find out what kind of place the Celestial Purging Mountain was.

When he returned to the Indigo Thunder Peak, it didn’t take long for dawn to rise. When he opened his eyes, Lin Yun looked at the sunlight shining through the window. But before he could do anything, a group of people ran over, with Chen Feng taking the lead.

“Senior Brother, something big happened!” Chen Feng yelled.

Lin Yun roughly knew what he was talking about but could only pretend not to know. He asked, “What is it?”

“Hehe, something good!”

“Senior Brother, Zhang Yue was stripped and hung on a tree outside the Profound Maiden Courtyard!”

“Hahaha! He’s buck naked and was hanging there for an entire night!”

“Senior Brother, let’s go and take a look. The entire Heavenly Dao Sect is alarmed, and we won’t have a good view if we don’t go there quickly.” The other Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples said before Chen Feng could continue.

They were all laughing, gloating at Zhang Yue’s misfortune. Lin Yun initially didn’t want to go and take a look, but it would only make him seem suspicious. Thus, he smiled, “Let’s go and look, then.”

“Let’s go! Several Quasi-Saints from the Dao Yang Palace came but failed to remove him from the tree. They’re all fuming in anger right now!”

“The Profound Maiden Courtyard’s elders are also furious, declaring that they want to kill him for tainting their sights.”

“The Profound Maiden Courtyard is bustling right now, even more than yesterday's conferring ceremony.”

“Hahaha!” The Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples were excited, and they didn’t notice the profound smile on Lin Yun’s face.
