Chapter 2013 - Cocky (1)

The black-clothed youth’s temperament made everyone nervous, and no one dared to speak. Some didn’t know who the black-clothed youth was nor why he dared to disrespect the Heavenly Dao Sect. But their faces changed when they saw his appearance, and they didn’t dare raise their voices. This was because the black-clothed youth was Jin Xuanyi, ranked first on the King Ranking.

The faces of the Heavenly Dao Sect’s saint disciples changed as they nervously drew their weapons. The corner of Nangong Fuye’s lips twitched, and his face became dark. He no longer had his earlier prideful appearance in front of Jin Xuanyi.

“I heard that Jin Xuanyi is so strong that even Quasi-Saints can’t do anything to him.”

“He’s also famed for being ruthless. Anyone who catches his attention will die.”

“Nangong Fuye was a little too cocky earlier. He might be ninth on the King Ranking, but there is a huge difference between him and Jin Xuanyi.”

“Jin Xuanyi is clearly here for the Divine Blood Flower. So it doesn’t matter if Nangong Fuye was cocky or not.”

Discussions resounded within the treehouse inn as everyone began to ponder. They felt that there might be changes to the owner of the Divine Blood Flower.

Wang Yue was the first who came to his senses. He looked at the surroundings, and the surrounding saint disciples immediately understood his intentions. They couldn’t let Nangong Fuye fight Jin Xuanyi like that, so they had to probe Jin Xuanyi’s strength first.

“So what if you’re Jin Xuanyi? You’re in no position to act with such impudence in front of my Heavenly Dao Sect!” Four saint disciples flew out, charging at the black-clothed man. They weren’t saint’s disciples but saint disciples who reached the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage and could be considered geniuses within the Eastern Desolation. They wanted to probe Jin Xuanyi’s strength after seeing that Nangong Fuye was placed in a difficult position.

“Is there no one else in the Heavenly Dao Sect? Just the few of you want to probe my strength?” Jin Xuanyi didn’t move from the table but simply pushed his palm forth. Lightning gathered within his palm, forming four purple vipers that charged forth.

The vipers easily pierced the nirvana aura around the four disciples and bit a huge chuck of flesh off of them. When the four disciples fell to the ground, they screamed in pain. But it didn’t end there. The vipers had quickly dashed forth, going after those saint disciples. The entire hall instantly fell silent, with everyone scared silly by this scene.

Xin Yan was the first to come to her senses and made a move. Four ribbons flew out and brought the four disciples back. When they were brought back, she saw that the four disciples were covered in blood. Their wounds were so deep that their bones and internal organs could be seen, creating a frightful scene.

“Let me take a look at them!” Wang Yue quickly stepped forth, since he possessed the Life Intent. He quickly examined their wounds while the other cultivators within the treehouse inn were dumbfounded.

“Holy shit, what grade is his Lightning Intent?!”

“Those four vipers have become crystallized. Just how terrifying is his attainment in lightning?!”

“This isn’t just Lightning Intent. This is too bizarre because those vipers looked vivid. I heard that Jin Xuanyi once received an opportunity and an ancient inheritance.”

Everyone was scared silly by Jin Xuanyi’s strength, and they knew those four disciples would die if Jin Xuanyi didn’t hold back.

“Nangong Fuye, weren’t you cocky earlier? Come on down!” Jin Xuanyi smiled.

At that moment, Nangong Fuye had completely sobered up, and he knew this wasn’t the moment to fight since the other holy lands’ men were watching. He had to stabilize Jin Xuanyi and protect the Divine Blood Flower.

“Who do you think you are, wanting Nangong Fuye to deal with you? I can easily deal with you!” Wang Muyan looked furious as she charged forth with her sword.

“Junior Sister Muyan!” Nangong Fuye became anxious when he saw this scene. Jin Xuanyi wasn’t a pushover, and Wang Muyan was too impulsive.

The four vipers dashed forth, two coiling themselves around Wang Muyan to immobilize her. The vipers were like coils that nearly deformed her bones, and Wang Muyan even had difficulty breathing. Looking at Nangong Fuye in pain, she said, “Senior Brother, save me…”

The two remaining vipers were on either side of her, wanting to take a bite out of her.

When he saw this scene, Nangong Fuye lost his composure and dashed forth. He was strong and easily severed the two vipers into two with a chop, making everyone’s eyes light up. But before he could save Wang Muyan, a palm landed on his chest, and he was sent flying away like a cannonball, smashing all the tables in his path to pieces.

“Senior Brother Nangong!” Everyone’s faces changed. When Wang Yue stepped forth to examine Nangong Fuye’s wounds, he saw that Nangong Fuye all of his ribs were broken, and even his heart was damaged. He had fainted with his life force gradually being sapped from him. This immediately made Wang Yue panic as he quickly circulated the Life Intent to pull Nangong Fuye back from the brink of death. But this was the best he could do. If Nangong Fuye wanted to fully recover, it would take at least six months.

Meanwhile, Xin Yan fell into deep thoughts because she sensed something wasn’t right. She knew how strong Nangong Fuye was. Even if he couldn’t rival Jin Xuanyi, he shouldn’t lose so easily. But his heart was unstable because he was in a hurry to save Wang Muyan earlier, and Jin Xuanyi seemed to have expected that Nangong Fuye would charge forth.

Nangong Fuye had lost consciousness, and Wang Muyan was in Jin Xuanyi’s hands. With that, the Heavenly Dao Sect was at the mercy of Jin Xuanyi.

Xin Yan maintained her composure and said, “Jin Xuanyi, what do you want? Wang Muyan is a descendant of the Wang Clan and our Heavenly Dao Sect’s holy maiden. If you touch her, no one can save you.”

Jin Xuanyi calmly drank his wine and smiled, “Isn’t she fine? Don’t worry about it. I naturally know who can be touched and who can’t since I’m still alive despite being so cocky. Isn’t that trash still alive as well?”

Xin Yan immediately guessed Jin Xuanyi’s intentions, and her face sank.

“Alright. We’re all smart people, and I didn’t come for that trash. Who has the Divine Blood Flower? Hand it over, and I’ll leave. Otherwise…” Jin Xuanyi smiled lecherously, “I can only bring the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden with me. Speaking of which, I haven’t tasted a holy maiden before!”

“You bastard! Put the holy maiden down!” The Heavenly Dao Sect’s saint disciples were furious, but none dared to step forth. After all, they had just witnessed what happened to Nangong Fuye.

“Don’t bother struggling. The more you struggle, the tighter they’ll wrap around you.” Jin Xuanyi waved his hand and controlled the vipers to bring Wang Muyan over.

“Let her go,” Xin Yan said.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Jin Xuanyi smiled, waving his hand, and the vipers returned to his body.

When Wang Muyan fell to the ground, a ribbon wrapped around her waist and pulled her over.

Jin Xuanyi merely smiled and drank his wine as he looked at Xin Yan.
