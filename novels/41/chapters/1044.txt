Chapter 1045 - As Wished!

Three days later, a name appeared on the Heavenly Path Mirror at the center of Four Phase City. With the final battle approaching, new names were appearing on the ranking. However, it was such a common event that no one was fazed.

This wasn’t a normal situation though. The new name was Lin Yun’s and he was the tenth name on the purple ranking. It was a dazzling achievement because not many people could place that high with their first appearance. In fact, no one would have been surprised if Lin Yun appeared on the gold ranking because he easily defeated He Qianfan.

After all, He Qianfan was ranked ninth on the purple ranking. In some people’s eyes, Lin Yun was too low on the ranking.

With the final battle approaching, many geniuses were appearing out of the blue. Some people even speculated that Lin Yun was a little too rash and completed his tribulation a little too early. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Since the Realms Sons only gave him half a month, he had to make a breakthrough in a really short amount of time. This undoubtedly affected his accumulation process.

Some people even speculated that Lin Yun only had talent in the sword path. The sword path wasn’t all there was to the martial path. But regardless of what everyone thought, Lin Yun was still on the purple ranking.

Those who made the gold ranking weren’t happy when they heard the commotion over Lin Yun. The gold ranking was higher than the purple ranking, so they had every right to be mad.

“He’s just a little more lucky than everyone else, but how can he actually be more popular than us?”

“So what if he killed twelve generals? All of us could easily suppress the generals if we wanted, but we don’t have any reason to become enemies with the Realm Sons.”

“All he did was foolishly offend the Realm Sons.” Those on the gold ranking gathered together with displeased faces.

Two days later, a shocking piece of news spread from Wind Mound City. The Demon Slaughtering Assembly would be held two days in advance. The Realm Sons also declared that anyone who could catch Lin Yun would receive the position of a general and one favor. That promise, however, was contingent upon the saint clan being able to accomplish it.

It was a shocking reward that everyone wanted. After all, everyone had to go through the Heavenly Path to reach Kunlun Realm. Afterwards, they weren’t even guaranteed to join a powerful sect. However, earning the reward of the Realm Sons to form a bond with a saint clan was enough to gain footing in the Kunlun Realm.

Additionally, news came out that the Realms Sons were furious with Lin Yun for sentencing He Qianfan to death. Now, the Realm Sons wanted to make it difficult for Lin Yun to reach Wind Mound City, and the best way to do that was to put a bounty on Lin Yun’s head.

Everyone could tell that the Realm Sons were messing around with Lin Yun. Clearly, they wanted to throw off his rhythm. If anyone else were in Lin Yun’s position, they would feel helpless.

“What a sinister plot. There’s no way we can measure up to the Realm Sons.”

“If Lin Yun heard the news while cultivating, he might run amok.”

“That’s not the most important thing about this situation. The members on the gold ranking might also make a move for the reward.”

“I’m afraid that everything will unfold in favor of the Realm Sons. They’re going to make Lin Yun die a terrible death.” The undercurrent was beginning to run wild in Four Phase City as a storm was coming. After all, the Realm Sons wanted to make Lin Yun crawl into the city in humiliation before the woman he loved.

It was a sinister plan devised by the Nether Divinity Realm Son. The Realm Sons had to resort to such extremes because more people would go against them if they weren’t heavy handed. The only outcome for Lin Yun was humiliation and torture.

At this moment, Lin Yun was practicing his sword right after finishing his tribulation. Relying on the dragon energy from the Azure Dragon True Bone, Lin Yun managed to get through to tribulation successfully. At the same time, he planted two Demonic Astral Flowers in each of his aura oceans.

The origin energy in his aura oceans had been refined by the dragon energy and was a lot stronger than what most people had. Now that he had two Demonic Astral Flowers in each of his aura oceans, he was much stronger than before. Although his cultivation wasn’t high, the quality of his origin energy surpassed that of his peers.

Others would only dare to subdue and refine Demonic Astral Flowers after reaching the sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. The Realm Sons weren’t an exception. However, Lin Yun managed to subdue eight Demonic Astral Flowers in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

“This isn’t enough.” There were only five days left until the Demonic Slaughtering Assembly and Lin Yun didn’t dare to rest for a single moment. He practiced the Heavenly Three Divides in his courtyard, fusing the essence of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist and two holy spirits into his moves.

Each of the Three Heavenly Divides was more terrifying than the last. Lin Yun had cultivated them to the manifestation stage and they were empowered with his sky sword intent. With the fusion of the holy spirits, his sword technique had reached a new level.

Solaris Lunar, which was the strongest form of the Three Heavenly Divides, was especially strong now. The move was a flawed move and Lin Yun had been relying on his comprehension of the Golden Crow to execute the attack. However, Lin Yun resolved the issue by using two holy spirits.

Once he was satisfied with his practice, he sheathed his sword. At this moment, he could sense someone coming into the courtyard.

The arrival of Luo Chen’s group had grabbed Lin Yun’s attention. They were only able to enter his restricted courtyard because they had received a permit.

As they walked into the courtyard, they tried to squeeze out smiles on their unhappy faces. However, no matter how they tried, they weren’t able to fake a smile.

“Lin Yun, this is important!” Luo Chen said when he walked in.

When Lin Yun heard that, his heart shook with an ill premonition. “Go on.”

Luo Chen initially wanted to tell Lin Yun what was going on, but he found it hard to speak when he tried. After a long while later, Luo Chen said, “The Demon Slaughtering Assembly has been pushed forward by two days.”

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that because that meant that he only had three days left. He would have to rush now. With his face darkened, Lin Yun gnashed his teeth, “I’m afraid that that’s not the only change, right?”

Luo Chen continued and told Lin Yun about the bounty that the Realm Sons placed on his head.

Lin Yun’s countenance became terrifyingly black as he asked, “What else is there?”

“There are rumors, just rumors, that the Nether Divinity Realm Son will strip a piece of clothing from Yue Weiwei for every day you’re late. He won’t stop until she’s completely naked,” said Luo Chen after taking a deep breath.

When Lin Yun heard that, his grim face blazed with fire. Even if he knew that this was a trick by the Realm Sons to upset him, he still couldn’t control his anger.

“Shameless!” Lin Yun said, gritting his teeth. They want my life? Do they really think that I’ll die? Since the Realm Sons wanted LIn Yun to head over early, then he would fulfill their wish.
