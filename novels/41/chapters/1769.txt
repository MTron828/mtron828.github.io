Chapter 1770 – Thunderblood Battlestage

The following day, when Lin Yun woke up, he rubbed his eyes. It had been a long time since he had slept so comfortably. While he was still in a daze, he faintly saw a person sitting on the stone stage not too far away.

Lin Yun instantly became awake when he saw Mu Xueling, and it was fortunate that they had done nothing last night. He asked, “Saint Elder, when did you come?”

“Fairly early.” Mu Xueling said.

As the atmosphere became a little stiff, Yue Weiwei opened her eyes. She was happy when she saw Mu Xueling, and she ran over. She affectionately said, “Senior Sister, are you here to look for Big Brother Lin? Why didn’t you wake us up? You must have been waiting here for a long time, right?”

Looking at Yue Weiwei and Mu Xueling, Lin Yun could tell they were close. This kind of affection definitely wasn’t just an ordinary relationship between martial sisters.

“Here you go.” Mu Xueling waved her hand, and the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella flew over.

When Lin Yun reached out, he could sense that the umbrella had become much heavier when he held onto it. With a heartbeat, he began to pour the golden-purple dragon runes into it, and the umbrella started to shine with a dazzling brilliance.

The aura that Lin Yun gave off also broke through a restriction and reached the Samsara Edict Realm. The Azure Dragon Constellation was also awakened beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven. A terrifying aura gathered on Lin Yun that made him look like an ancient awakening beast.

The saint runes on the surface of the umbrella also began to bloom, and the first seal was lifted. As a powerful saint aura poured from the umbrella into Lin Yun’s body, Lin Yun was shocked because the saint aura within the Sovereign Saint Artifact was activated. He could sense that an ancient Azure Dragon was wandering in a vast river within the umbrella.

He could even feel a blood connection with the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, and all the thunderstorm energies in the world were within his control. This was a mysterious feeling, and his eyes flickered with excitement. He had a feeling that if he opened the umbrella now, he might be able to make the Sovereign Constellation descend.

At the Ancient Barren Battlefield, his physique had already reached a limit when he only summoned the Azure Dragon’s head. But he could feel that it would be much easier now, and this feeling was too profound.

“Don’t activate it for real because others will detect it.” When he couldn’t hold back his excitement and wanted to try it, Mu Xueling’s voice was like a bucket of ice water pouring down his head, immediately waking him up.

He quickly put away the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella before cupping his hands together, “Thank you, Saint Elder.”

“This is nothing. But don’t be too complacent about it. A Sovereign Saint Artifact might be powerful, but it’s not something you can control with your current cultivation. You know what I’m talking about.” Mue Xueling lightly stated.

Lin Yun nodded his head. His dragon pulses were destroyed before, and they were nearly beyond recovery. This was because he had used a power that had far exceeded what his physique could bear. But now that he had the Dual Dragon Saint Physique, he wouldn’t be in such a pathetic state if he used it again.

After Mu Xueling left, Yue Weiwei asked, “Big Brother Lin, when will we leave?”

“How about three days?” After a brief pondering, Lin Yun said that he still needed time to adjust his strength.

At night, Lin Yun practiced his sword in his courtyard. He first practiced the Azure Dragon Sword Art, starting from Azure Dragon Claw to Azure Dragon Horns, fully exhibiting the full power of the seven swords.

Seven swords later, the dragon aura he gave off reached a terrifying height. He had already reached the manifestation in the seven sword forms, but the real difficulty lied in the last three swords: the Nine Heavenly Storm, Thunder Spike, and Universal Thunderstorm.

“Nine Heavenly Storm!” Lin Yun turned around and swung his sword down in mid-air. As Lin Yun’s aura continued to rise, this sword unleashed a tornado that was a few hundred feet in height, tearing the space in it’s path apart inch by inch. The tornado would become even more terrifying if he executed this attack without reservations.

“Thunder Spike!” He then proceeded to the next sword form. As he soared to the sky, his Azure Dragon Sword Intent started accumulating, and all the thunder energy within a few thousand miles of radius gathered towards him. In the end, the thunder energy condensed into nine shackles shrouding the sword, causing the Flower Burial Sword to shine brightly, and the thunderstorm energy contained within it allowed Lin Yun to release an aura that was at the Samsara Edict Realm.

“Universal Thunderstorm!” After he unleashed the Thunder Spike, all the dragon origin within his body began to pour out just when he was in mid-air. Bolts of lightning began to flicker on the surface of his body, and the powerful wind made his hair flutter violently. At this moment, his pupils were filled with thunderstorms and it was as though he was on the verge of going berserk; he could even tear the sky apart.

“Universal Thunderstorm!” Perfectly fusing the Wind and Lightning Intent, this sword Lin Yun unleashed was close to dao. When he swung his sword, all the shackles that were bound on him by heaven and earth shattered.

Back in the Three-Lives Realm, he couldn’t grasp the profundity of this sword form because there was no concept of heaven and earth. But since he decided to participate in the Martial Dao Tea Party, he naturally had to grasp the last sword form.

As his sword rays and thunderstorms roared, the shockwave caused by his attacks still lingered in the air, even when he was done performing an entire set of the Azure Dragon Sword Art. But no one could distinguish whether it was a dragon roar or a sword vibration.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun turned around and descended towards the ground. When he sat with his legs crossed, he casually stabbed the Flower Burial Sword into the ground beside him.

When he activated his Sword Heart, the lingering sword intent that was in the air formed a complete picture. This was the scene he left behind when he practiced his sword earlier. It was being replayed to him under his Sword Heart.

“The Sword Heart is actually so miraculous?” Lin Yun stared at those afterimages and the trajectory of the sword rays. He was pretty shocked himself because it was a casual attempt of trying to look at the traces he left behind. But he never expected that the lingering sword intent would move under his Sword Heart.

Although the afterimages were blurred, he could clearly see the various trajectories. After observing it once, Lin Yun closed his eyes to comprehend the last sword form, Universal Thunderstorm. He felt that this was pretty similar to the last sword form when he practiced the Overlord Sword in the past, breaking free of the shackles of heaven and earth to unleash a sword despite facing thousands of enemies.

Three days later, Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei set off for Thunder Island. Aside from the four regions in Heavenly Domain City, thousands of islands were near the sea area. But the islands were remote, and every Martial Dao Tea Party would be held on Thunder Island.

Thunder Island was more than a hundred thousand miles away from Heavenly Domain City, and the journey was complicated. It would take some time to travel from Heavenly Domain City.

When Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei left the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, they could clearly sense that the atmosphere within Heavenly Domain City had changed. Many people were heading towards Thunder Island as well.

“I heard that the Dragon Pulse Ranking’s geniuses from the six holy lands are also coming to this Martial Dao Tea Party. I wonder if the Four Young Masters can hold up the pride of our Heavenly Domain City.”

“Hard to say. The geniuses from the holy lands are ruthless people, especially Ji Lingfeng from Divine Phoenix Mountain. He had been first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking after Jian Jingtian, and I’m afraid the Four Young Masters aren’t his opponent. He will definitely be first this time as well.”

“Haha. Ji Lingfeng is strong, but the Heavenly Flame Sect’s Yan Chihuo isn’t weak, either. He’s a monster, slaying ten-odd Quasi-Samsara Edict Realm experts with his blade.”

“Not surprising. The holy land geniuses will surely shine during this Martial Dao Tea Party, and the first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking will either end up in one of the hands of the six holy land geniuses or one of the Four Young Masters. But I wonder if there will be any other forces.”

“You’re overthinking it. I’m afraid if anyone from the other forces can even make it into the top twenty. The Eastern Desolation belongs to the six holy lands, and the Four Young Masters are from Ancient Saint Clans, not to mention having the Divine Dragon Empire backing them up. So how can others possibly rival them?”

Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei walked on the streets, one wearing a bamboo hat and the other wearing a veil. Walking along the road, everyone was discussing the Martial Dao Tea Party.

“Looks like the tea party this time will be different.” Yue Weiwei looked at Lin Yun with a smile.

Lin Yun nodded because the Black Tortoise Void Sea commotion attracted the geniuses of the six holy lands. But because they couldn’t go there anytime soon, they naturally came for the meeting that was coincidentally held close by.

“I heard that the Wind Edge Lord is the main person behind this Martial Dao Tea Party, and he moved this tea party forward by a month.” Yue Weiwei said.

Hearing the Wind Edge Lord’s name made Lin Yun furrow his brows, and he had a deep impression of this person. Back at the West Garden Banquet, the Wind Edge Lord was arrogant and disdainful to the idea of fighting him.

“He has great ambitions and has been planning to be first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.” Yue Weiwei said.

“He wants to be first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking? He probably wants it so that he could receive rewards from the Divine Dragon Empire, but it won’t be that easy.” Lin Yun had no favorable opinion of this person.

While they were casually chatting, they arrived at Thunder Island half a day later. This island was enveloped in thunderclouds, and the surrounding environment was harsh, with a layer of faint purple fog covering the island. Thunder Island was vast, and the Martial Dao Tea Party was to be held at the center of the island, also known as the Thunderblood Square.

The Thunderblood Square had a radius of ten-odd miles and was forged with thundergold metal, then drenched in the blood of saint beasts. After soaking in the blood, the thundergold metal become hideous, emitting a wild and ferocious aura.

The thundergold metal was so tough that even Samsara Edict Realm experts would have trouble breaking it, not to mention it was further fortified with saint blood. There were guards outside the Thunderblood Square, and you had to undergo a test to enter if you didn’t have an invitation. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

There were many pavilions in the square distributed in all directions. The center of the square was where the saint blood was poured on. It was left alone to be a stage for battle. At this moment, there were many geniuses gathered on the Thunderblood Square.

This was initially a private gathering, but then Jian Jingtian departed from the Dragon Pulse Ranking. Thus, the Martial Dao Tea Party became huge this time. As time passed, more people began to gather.

“It’s really saint blood…” Lin Yun could sense an astonishing aura coming from the blood covering the Thunderblood Battlestage. If one wasn’t strong enough, just the aura of the saint blood would be enough to suppress them.

This also made Lin Yun more interested in the Martial Dao Tea Party. More Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses began to gather on the Thunderblood Square, and those acquainted with each other stood together.

When Lin Yun saw the Sword Sect’s party, he breathed a sigh of relief. A blazing aura swept out right then, and a sharp cry echoed. This commotion naturally attracted everyone’s attention, and Lin Yun’s heart skipped a beat when he saw the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s party’s arrival.
