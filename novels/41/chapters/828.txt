Chapter 829 - Sovereign Dragon Projection

Lin Yun’s eyes radiated with cold killing intent. As soon as his sword pierced through Yan Long’zi’s chest, the latter could sense his vitality frantically disappearing along with half of his profound amber aura gushing out.

The profound amber aura had traces of gold blood. When Lin Yun looked closely, he counted nine droplets that were brimming with vitality. Everyone could hear an ancient roar as the blood struggled to break free. However, it was controlled by the profound amber aura and flew towards Lin Yun.

“Flame dragon blood essence!”

“Holy shit, is that Yan Long’zi’s blood essence? It was actually extracted by the profound amber aura!” A commotion broke out among the audience when they saw this. Simultaneously, Lin Yun’s mouth dropped in disbelief because he never expected this to happen.

“No! No! No! That’s mine…” Yan Long’zi’s eyes slowly dimmed as he held onto the Flower Burial Sword and wailed.

Lin Yun waved his hand and the Flower Burial Sword flew out of Yan Long’zi and returned to his hand. The instant Lin Yun held his sword, Yan Long’zi fell to his knees as his head drooped.

After Lin Yun’s dragon projection devoured the profound amber aura containing the flame dragon bloodline, it began to shine brightly. After the bright light dissipated, the dragon projection finished its transformation. The dragon projection had grown a fifth claw, becoming the first Five-clawed Golden Dragon.

“It has nine feet and five claws! That’s the Sovereign Dragon Projection!”

“The aura is really terrifying. I can’t believe that Lin Yun is the first to possess it.”

“If he can last until the end and refine it, who knows what kind of benefits he will get.”

“It won’t be easy. Lin Yun will lose the Sovereign Dragon Projection if he even loses one battle. It’s too hard for him to maintain.” Just as everyone started shouting, the dragon projection returned to Lin Yun. Then, his cultivation rose to the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm.

A terrifying aura was released from Lin Yun as his cultivation stabilized into the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. At this moment, his aura was the same as veterans like Jiang Ziye.

Furthermore, in secret, Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Seal ferociously devoured Yang Long’zi’s blood essence. The nine droplets caused a huge transformation to his Azure Dragon Battle Physique, which completely surprised Lin Yun. He never expected that Yan Long’zi’s flame dragon blood essence was even stronger than the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s blood essence.

“You’re too ruthless!” Two of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s elders flew into a rage as they looked over the body of Yan Long’zi.

Collecting himself, Lin Yun responded, “He simply got his just desserts. There hasn’t been a single righteous soul that’s died from my sword. Plus, I never regret those that I kill!”

Lin Yun didn’t emphasize any of his words, but they left a strong impression on everyone. At this moment, he showed the world what it meant to be a swordsman. However, the elders from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion weren’t happy.

“No unrelated people are allowed on the stage. Please leave,” said the Sacred Alliance’s judge.

“Stop embarrassing yourselves,” said the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s pavilion master as he looked at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze. Very quickly, Lin Yun and the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s elders left the stage.

The next few battles didn’t have the same excitement that Lin Yun and Yan Long’zi’s did. Mu Han ended up having to face Zhao Wuji and lost. Then, Yu Haotian fought Bai Lixuan and dominated the latter. The three kings were too strong, especially Yu Haotian. Until now, no one could force him to bring out 50% of his strength.

“Lin Yun VS Jiang Ziye!” The judge’s announcement caused a huge uproar because it was finally Lin Yun’s turn. His popularity reached an all time high since he was able to defeat Yan Long’zi. As an underdog in the tournament, he created the biggest upset in history. In the future, his fame would most likely be at the same level of Yu Haotian.

After all, the defeat of Yan Long’zi meant that Lin Yun was now one of the three kings. When Jiang Ziye got to the stage, her complexion was a lot better than before. Her confidence was destroyed in her fight with Yu Haotian, but she recovered after a few battles.

“I didn’t expect you to kill Yan Long’zi. I don’t think that I can even last ten moves against you,” smiled Jiang Ziye. She was greatly shocked by the battle between Lin Yun and Yan Long’zi, especially when Lin Yun used his sword to shatter Yan Long’zi’s flame intent.

Yan Long’zi’s Flame Dragon Vajra Physique was truly powerful. However, Lin Yun waited for the right opportunity and struck like a viper. Until now, Lin Yun had been a composed fighter who didn’t make any mistakes.

“I’m just lucky,” replied Lin Yun.

“There’s no such thing as luck in this banquet. Alright, that’s enough talking. Let’s fight. I’m telling you right now, I won’t go down easily,” said Jiang Ziye. Her eyes shined brightly as she circulated her cloud intent.

A powerful suction force came from her palm, but Lin Yun calmly dodged it and left behind a few afterimages. After reaching the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm, his Seven Profound Steps had become even more powerful. At the same time, a wisp of sword ray shot towards Jiang Ziye from the Flower Burial Sword.

Jiang Ziye had no change on her face and reached out with her finger. But the moment she shattered the sword aura, Jiang Ziye frowned because every afterimage she touched contained the same sword intent. She wasn’t certain if Lin Yun was hiding among the afterimages, so she didn’t dare to be careless.

However, she forgot that a brief moment of hesitation was an opening for a swordsman.

Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slash!

The sword intent that she sucked into her palm suddenly exploded. At the same time, Lin Yun twisted his wrist as dozens of lightning bolts converged together.

The clouds dispersed, signaling that Jiang Ziye’s cloud intent had crumbled. Jiang Ziye began to panic once this happened. She quickly retracted her cloud intent and frantically retreated, shooting dozens of silks sheets at Lin Yun.

In the next second, Lin Yun’s vision was filled with the color white. However, he remained calm and swung his sword, easily tearing the silks apart.

“Heavenly Cloudbreaking Palm!” Jiang Ziye took this opportunity to unleash her strongest move. As the clouds split apart, a gigantic palm came crashing down.

“Overlord Sword–Tai’a Slash!” Lin Yun didn’t let up and unleashed a crescent moon sword ray. When the sword ray grew to a full moon, the palm descending from the sky began to crumble.

Jiang Ziye’s face turned pale as she retreated, “Cloud Disperse.”

In the next second, Jiang Ziye’s body dispersed like a cloud so Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to lock onto her aura. However, nothing could stop Lin Yun at this moment as he swung his sword again. Overlord Sword–Blood Suppression.

Lin Yun’s sword descended from the sky and unleashed a boundless crimson radiance. With torrential crimson radiance shooting into the sky, a gigantic azure dragon was seen above the clouds as it basked in crimson light.

The dragon descended and suppressed the air, which forced Jiang Ziye to reveal herself. When Lin Yun’s sword finished swinging, Jiang Ziye threw up blood and flew across the stage. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Coughing a few times, Jiang Ziye’s eyes flashed with fear. In that split second, she felt like she was about to become minced meat. She could feel cold sweat dripping down her back as though she had just taken a trip to hell.

“You won.” Jiang Ziye sighed. At this moment, she knew that there was no luck involved in Lin Yun’s fight with Yan Long’zi. Only those who faced Lin Yun head-on knew how terrifying he was.
