Chapter 2243 - Fun Is Going To Begin

Lin Yun opened his mouth in shock and wondered if he had heard incorrectly. Li Feibai is so calm and composed even though he is about to die? Lin Yun asked, “Brother Li, are you messing around with me?”

“Do I look like someone who would joke around? It’s just a fatal injury. Don’t tell me that you’re so inexperienced?” Li Feibai replied.

The corner of his lips twitched as Lin Yun replied, “Brother Li, you’re truly extraordinary.”

“To someone like me who’s blessed by fortune, fatal injuries can also be considered an opportunity, and I won’t die so easily. Didn’t I run into you?” Li Feibai said.

“So I’m your fortune,” Lin Yun mocked, looking at Li Feibai.

But Li Feibai didn’t hear the sarcasm and said, “It’s good that you know. Let’s go.”

Lin Yun ultimately couldn’t hold back his laughter.

“What are you laughing at?” Li Feibai asked, suppressing his anger.

“This is my first time seeing someone asking for help in such a stubborn tone,” Lin Yun chuckled. Although he didn’t mind helping Li Febai, this person’s attitude was really unpleasant.

Li Feibai laughed and calmly said, “I know the location of the Divine Blood Fruit.”

Lin Yun’s face changed upon hearing that, and he looked at Li Feibai.

“Let’s hurry up. I won’t compete with you for the Divine Blood Fruit, so you can feel relieved about it,” Li Feibai said, confident that Lin Yun could accept it.

Lin Yun gave a glance at Lil’ Red.

“Don’t believe me?” Li Feibai asked.

“Leave carrying men to me. My Big Brother only carries women,” Lil’ Red soared to the sky and changed into an Ancient Dracoape, lifting Li Feibai.

“Only women…” But before Li Feibai could finish, he exclaimed, and was already on the Ancient Dracoape’s shoulder when he came to his senses. The turmoil made him throw out a mouthful of blood, his face pale.

After seeing his pale face, Lin Yun jumped up and finally believed Li Feibai. He asked, “Are your injuries alright? Do you want me to take a look? I might be able to help you.”

Li Feibai waved his hand, and he said, “There’s no need. I’m not injured, but I’m suffering from the Blood Poison. I’ll be fine after leaving here. Hmph, chop the tree in front of you.”

Li Feibai pointed at a tree in front as he spoke, letting Lin Yun cut it down.

As Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword, the tree was cut down, and the surrounding fog became lighter. But before Lin Yun could respond, a few spears were flying in their direction. Those spears gave off such a huge pressure that even Lin Yun’s palm began to tremble.

“Let’s go! It has discovered us!” Li Feibai said.

But Lil’ Red was one step slower, taking a spear and nearly falling to the ground. As Lil’ Red swayed, Li Feibai was nearly thrown off, but Lin Yun quickly reached out to hold him.

“Let’s go immediately! Don’t stop!”

Lin Yun didn’t know what was happening, but he comforted Lil’ Red and called it to increase its speed. Thereafter, Li Feibai would occasionally get Lin Yun to chop down some trees, and Lin Yun’s sight became clearer. His sword intent could sense that they were swiftly leaving this place. He asked, “What’s going on?”

“A Demon-Refining Tree is living in these woods, and the entire area is controlled by it. Ten-odd people have tried to attack it earlier to get the Demon-Refining Fruit, and I obtained the best one amongst all of the Demon-Refining Fruit. You can even call it the Myriad Demon Fruit,” Li Feibai explained.

Lin Yun was surprised because he had heard of the Demon-Refining Tree before, but it was rare to see one still alive. He asked, “So you’re being pursued by that Demon-Refining Tree?”

“Not really. It can’t move around, so it sets up a confusion array that stops anyone from leaving, and you’ll ultimately go to its territory, just like you did. But you’re lucky that I made a move, or you would be dead if you took a few more steps forth,” Li Feibai said. This made Lin Yun furious because it turned out that Li Feibai was the mastermind behind all of this.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But Li Feibai didn’t know about that and took out the Myriad Demon Fruit. He smiled, “This is even rarer than the Divine Blood Fruit. The Divine Blood Fruit is useless to Saint Lords, but the Myriad Demon Fruit is different.”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he looked at the Myriad Demon Fruit, emitting a faint red radiance and fragrance. In the fog that it released, Lin Yun could sense saint daos within it, and it felt like lesser realms when he got closer to sense it. Each lesser realm had a flower or spiritual beast in it.

“Haha, not bad, right?” Li Feibai smiled smugly, “Do you know why I’m not competing with you for the Divine Blood Fruit now? The Divine Blood Fruit won’t have much of an effect on you. Your Blood Cloud Saint Fruit can be considered a treasure, but it’s nothing compared to my Myriad Demon Fruit.”

“You were around?” Lin Yun asked.

Li Feibai stowed the Demon-Refining Fruit and calmly said, “Didn’t I tell you that if I’m not willing, you won’t be able to discover me? That Liu Yunlan was still guessing who you were, but I could recognize you with a glance. Aside from you, no one could perform a sword technique so ethereal.”

Lin Yun smiled, “It’s hard to receive your praise.”

“Ethereal isn’t exactly a good praise. It can also mean too fancy and unrealistic. Regarding sword techniques, you still have to look at Skysolute City,” Li Feibai rolled his eyes.

Lin Yun merely smiled and said nothing about it. Li Feibai might be harsh with his words, but he was gradually becoming weaker, and he only had half of his life left when they were about to leave the woods.

When Lin Yun wanted to check Li Feibai’s condition, the latter’s lips trembled, and he refused to let Lin Yun check his wounds. He said, “I’m fine. I’ll be fine after we leave the woods.”

When they were out of the woods, Li Feibai jumped down from the Ancient Dracoape, took a pellet, and placed it in his mouth before meditating. He was enveloped in a saint radiance with a lotus beneath him.

“Big Brother, this fellow is annoying. Why don’t we…” Lil’ Red stared at Li Feibai, feeling that this person was filled with treasures.

“I feel that we should just knock him out and strip him naked,” Lil’ Red said furiously. Li Feibai looked down on Lin Yun multiple times and even wore a smug look while speaking about the Myriad Demon Fruit, which was getting on its nerves.

“No need. This person might not be likeable, but he’s not bad,” Lin Yun said as he waited by the side.

A few minutes later, Li Feibai opened his eyes and no longer looked weak.

Now that Lin Yun noticed it, Li Feibai looked rather pretty, and he was amazed by how Li Feibai recovered so quickly.

Li Feibai smiled, “Flower Burial, I didn’t bluff you, right? Fatal injuries are nothing.”

Lin Yun finally acknowledged his words, and said, “Alright. But why didn’t you use the antidote since you had it with you?”

“The Poison Relieving Pellet has to be used with the Dragon Jade Flame Lotus. How could I dare to use it in the woods? I would only die faster in that case. Furthermore, thanks for guarding me,” Li Feibai said.

“Where’s the Divine Blood Fruit?” Lin Yun went straight into the topic.

“No idea,” Li Feibai replied.

Lin Yun’s face sank when he heard that and released his murderous intent, looking at Li Feibai coldly.

Li Feibai looked at the Flower Burial Sword deeply and smiled, “Your murderous intent is pretty terrifying. I wonder how many lives you have taken. I’ll stop teasing you now. I don’t know where the Divine Blood Fruit is, but I can bring you to where it will be.”

As he spoke, he took out a white mouse and caressed it. He explained, “This is the Snow Jade Mouse, which possesses an ancient bloodline. So it can remember the treasures that it has smelled before.”

“It has smelled the Divine Blood Fruit before?” Lin Yun asked, looking at the Snow Jade Mouse.

“Of course.” Li Feibai caressed the mouse as he placed it on the ground and gently spoke with it. As the Snow Jade Mouse sniffed the air, it began to lead the way.

“It has already been so long. Will others take the Divine Blood Fruit?” Lin Yun shared his concern. He had to get the Divine Blood Fruit no matter what and bring it back to the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

“You don’t have to worry about that. Phenomena will accompany the appearance of a Divine Blood Fruit. Even if someone has discovered it, they could only wait for it to ripen,” Li Feibai said.

Suddenly, the Snow Jade Mouse became excited. When Li Feibai squatted down and allowed it to crawl to his palm, he smiled, “We have determined the location now.”

As he spoke, he placed the Snow Jade Mouse on the ground and it dashed out with Lin Yun and Li Feibai following behind it, but they could only see a white blur.

“What speed!” Lin Yun was shocked.

“This Snow Jade Mouse is a little timid. Its talent is all put into running. In terms of escaping, even a Great Saint might be unable to catch up with it,” Li Feibai said. “If it was not to look for your Divine Blood Fruit, I wouldn’t have let it out.”

“Thank you,” Lin Yun said.

“There’s no need to thank me. I might be hateful, but I will keep my promise…” Li Feibai said, and he looked at Lil' Red.

Lin Yun coughed because Li Feibai had heard what Lil’ Red said earlier.

The Snow Jade Mouse stopped on a mountain, where Lin Yun saw a massive valley. Various flowers were on the ground, and many saints were waiting there. Practically all of the holy lands’ disciples were present. Aside from that, some saints looked extremely old, and anyone could tell that they would soon run out of life span.

Seeing so many people here, Lin Yun was certain that the Divine Blood Fruit was here.

“See what I said?” Li Feibai said as the Snow Jade Mouse returned to his sleeves.

“So many people…” Lin Yun wore a grave expression as he clenched his fist.

“This is nothing. If the divine flame appears, you’ll know what huge chaos means, and there are many ruthless people here in the Heavenly Void,” Li Feibai said as he toyed around with his hair, smiling.

Lin Yun looked at Li Feibai and smiled, “People say that I’m arrogant, but you’re the arrogant one in my eyes.”

Li Feibai accepted that evaluation and smiled, “This is nothing, so don’t worry.”

“You’re not going to leave?” Lin Yun asked.

Li Feibai was surprised as he looked at Lin Yun. He asked, “You’re weird. Don’t tell me a Quasi-Saint like you dares to compete for the Divine Blood Fruit? A swordsman’s fangs are terrifying, but they won’t last long. The moment someone sees through you, you won’t be able to live even if you have nine lives. Since you saved my life, I will naturally repay it. I will help you to obtain the Divine Blood Fruit. I don’t need it, but you can just give me a few leaves.”

Lin Yun was speechless, not knowing if Li Feibai was serious with what he said.

“Ha, this fellow is a show-off,” Lil’ Purple complained from the Iris Secret Realm.

Li Feibai ignored what Lin Yun thought as he retreated to the side to rest, acting as though he would compete for the Divine Blood Fruit.

Lin Yun held onto his chin because he couldn’t read this person.

Three days later, phenomena appeared as an indigo divine radiance bloomed before soaring to the sky. Lin Yun and Li Feibai opened their eyes as everyone in the valley stood up.

Li Feibai smiled, “I guess the fun is going to begin?”
