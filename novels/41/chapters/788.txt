Chapter 789 - Dazzling Divine Dragon Projection

This year’s Draconic Banquet was exciting for the spectators since many top-tier geniuses were defeated. Even Ji Feng lost to Lin Yun, which made Lin Yun become even more famous.

When the sun was setting, the ten judges finally finished determining who would make it to the next round. A judge dressed in black with white hair appeared at the center of the lake. His aura was unfathomable and he emitted immense pressure on everyone present. Additionally, a massive dragon could be vaguely seen behind him.

The old man started his announcement, “The elimination round has officially come to an end and the list of names for the third stage has come out. Everyone, welcome the divine dragon with me!”

Welcome the divine dragon? Lin Yun was puzzled. Even some of the elders who had watched several Draconic Banquets throughout the years were confused. They had watched many banquets, but they had never heard of this before. Could it be that there was still a dragon in the world?

While confusion permeated the crowd, a rumbling sound echoed throughout the lake and the entire city began to tremble violently. Lin Yun’s heart jolted as if someone was banging on an ancient drum.

The other geniuses were also baffled as this type of ceremony had never occurred in the past. At this moment, everyone felt their hearts thumping uncontrollably. When Lin Yun looked carefully, he saw a golden aura rise from the lake while the water trembled.

As the drum gradually got louder, the clouds in the sky started to split apart. Soon, a starry sky was revealed in the dark that seemed to transcend space and time.

While everyone was dazzled by the brilliance of the starry sky, a dragon roar echoed out. The golden aura from the lake formed a massive dragon that hovered over the Nine Dragon Lake.

Everyone was shocked and nervous at this sight. Shortly after, a dragon roar from beyond the nine heavens descended onto the golden dragon. Suddenly, the golden dragon came to life as a wisp of dragon aura entered the golden dragon.

“That…”

“Is that the divine dragon whose presence extends to countless worlds?”

“The divine dragon projection! I can’t remember the last time I saw it. This Draconic Banquet is truly the most exciting one in the last few millennia.

“We’re so fortunate to see it. The new era is arriving.” All of the elders in attendance trembled with excitement. As for the sect masters of the nine overlord forces, they wore solem expressions. They knew that the new era was arriving, but were still dumbfounded when the divine dragon projection appeared.

The drums suddenly came to a stop as the clouds covered the sky once more. When Lin Yun raised his head, he couldn’t help feeling surprised by the ancient azure divine dragon. The azure dragon was massive and mighty, but it disappeared when he tried to get a better look at it.

“That…” Lin Yun started to speak, but before he could finish his words, the profound amber aura in the jade tokens started pouring out. Those who maintained their winning streak had a bigger profound amber aura than those who couldn’t. As for the three kings and seven elites, their profound amber aura was shockingly bright, especially Yu Haotian, Zhao Wuji, and Yan Long’zi. When Lin Yun took a look at his profound amber aura, it wasn’t inferior in any way.

The divine dragon projection looked around and divided itself into over a hundred dragon projections. Then, each projection appeared in front of the profound amber aura of each genius who participated. As the profound amber aura poured into each dragon projection, the dragon projections started growing in size.

Excluding Jue Chen and Ji Feng, the dragon projections of the top ten were massive and had claws. The dragon projections finished devouring the profound amber aura before wrapping themselves around their respective genius. Then, they entered the jade tokens, waiting to be awakened again.

The Draconic Banquet truly deserved its reputation since everyone had a dragon projection. This also brought the excitement of the banquet to a whole new level as no one expected the divine dragon to cast its projection down.

The geniuses looked at their jade tokens and fell into deep thoughts. They had witnessed the dragon aura merge with the golden dragon. Although they couldn’t tell anything right now, they knew that there was something special about this Draconic Banquet.

“Hmph, pieces of garbage that will become my stepping stone.” Yu Haotian, who didn’t seem to be interested in anything, held onto his jade token with fighting spirit in his eyes. These people have no idea that they have to get first place to obtain the dragon aura.

Although those in the top ten had a chance of getting the dragon aura too, it was only guaranteed to the first place person. After all, first place would be given more than what the other ninety-nine participants would receive combined. Yan Long’zi and Zhao Wuji’s gazes were also heated because as part of the three kings, they knew secrets that the others didn’t.

As for Lin Yun, he played with his jade token and didn’t think about anything else. He was still focused on the azure dragon outside the nine heavens.

Suddenly, Lin Yun recalled what Drifting Goblet said about the Heavenly Gate. Could it be that the starry sky was the Heavenly Gate?

Wait for me. Lin Yun held onto his jade token tightly. Regardless if it was for his sword or his promise to Su Ziyao, he was determined to step through the Heavenly Gate.

“The ranking battle will start seven days from now.” The mysterious old man said again.

Seven days? Those who witnessed the divine dragon projection were feeling impatient for the ranking battle. They wanted to know what would happen when the dragon projections awoke from the jade tokens.

But thinking about it again, the elimination battle was pretty brutal and many people had suffered decent injuries. So everyone needed rest or they wouldn’t be able to bring out their full strength in the ranking battle. Even Lin Yun had exhausted a lot of his mental energy.

“You guys can stroll in the city if you want for the next seven days. However, any and all battles are prohibited. I believe the various sect masters won’t want to challenge our Sacred Alliance’s authority.” The old man smiled and looked at the sect masters of the nine overlord forces.

The Dragoncloud Ranking was too important and no one could guarantee that those sect masters wouldn’t try to do anything. In past banquets, a few of the sect masters ignored the warnings and took a few risks in causing trouble.

The old man retracted his smile and continued coldly, “This is my one and only warning. If anyone tries anything during this banquet, there will be consequences!”

A terrifying aura exploded from the old man that sent chills down everyone’s spine. Even the sect masters of the overlord forces became cautious.

“Well then, we will see you all in seven days.” The old man waved his sleeve and left the Nine Dragon Lake.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
