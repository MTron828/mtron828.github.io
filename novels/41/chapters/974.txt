Chapter 975 - Feng Xuanyi

Everyone was shocked when they saw Song Rui falling onto his knees. Did the Gloryearth Spirit’s owner actually fall to his knees because of Lin Yun’s gaze?

“What’s going on?” Even Song Rui was shocked by his own actions as his face turned pale. It was only after falling to his knees that he stopped acting subconsciously. However, when he was about to stand up, he felt an invisible sword aura that pierced his body.

His legs were heavy and they refused to work. Beads of sweat covered Song Rui’s face from a fear he had never felt in his life. His confidence was shattered and he lost all courage to fight Lin Yun. As for Shi Xuan, he was also terrified. He managed to stand up, ready to retreat, but stopped when he sensed Lin Yun’s gaze.

“Leave the Divine Firebird’s beast core and bloodline behind. After that, you guys can get lost,” said Lin Yun. He wasn’t a butcher. He simply wanted to teach Shi Xuan and Song Rui a lesson. The extra three slaps were a means to venting his anger. The first slap was because of what happened back in the sea of astral flames. The second slap was to let Shi Xuan know that obtaining an astral spirit didn’t mean that he could do whatever he wanted. And the last slap was for Shi Xuan to remember Lin Yun’s words.

Shi Xuan’s face changed when he heard that. After all, that Divine Firebird was a peak Divine Core Realm demonic beast. Its value wasn’t inferior to Lin Yun’s painting in any way.

“Lin Yun, don’t push it!” Shi Xuan’s eyes blazed with flames. “First you took the painting, now you want my beast core? Who do you think you are?!”

“It looks like you don’t understand your current situation,” said Lin Yun with a raised brow.

“I’ll do it! I’ll hand it over!” On the other hand, Song Rui immediately took out the bloodline. He didn’t need Lin Yun to say another word. Finally, Lin Yun had the black lump of blood containing the faint golden silk that represented the Golden Crow’s bloodline.

“You can go.” Lin Yun put the bloodline away before glancing at Song Rui. At this moment, Song Rui felt so relieved that he turned around and ran for his life.

As for Shi Xuan, his face alternated between the colors white and green. His face became ugly as he watched Song Rui flee because he never would have expected his teammate to be such a coward. No matter how reluctant he felt, he had to grit his teeth and hand over Divine Firebird’s beast core. “I’ll hand it over!”

Lin Yun took the beast core and examined it. However, he wasn’t in a hurry to put it away. Shi Xuan stood up uneasily because he had no idea what Lin Yun was trying to do. “I gave you the beast core. Our grudge has been resolved.”

“I changed my mind. Hand over another 500 divine astral pellets,” said Lin Yun after putting the beast core away. He was staring at Shi Xuan who desperately wanted to leave.

“Don’t take it too far!” Shi Xuan pointed at Lin Yun furiously.

“It looks like you still don’t understand the current situation.” Lin Yun’s gaze became cold as the Divine Sun Breaking Seal bloomed in his palm. Golden brilliance shined out as a winged human appeared behind him. At this moment, Lin Yun was emitting boundless pressure that made the hall shake.

“Fin…” Shi Xuan’s face changed as he tried to agree to Lin Yun’s demands, but he was cut off.

“Too late!” Lin Yun clenched his fist and threw out a punch, breaking Shi Xuan’s ribs and forcing Shi Xuan to vomit blood. The impact caused the wall behind Shi Xuan to shatter as flames started to burn his insides. Cracks also started to appear in his aura oceans.

Reaching out and grabbing Shi Xuan’s interspatial pouch, Lin Yun said, “You can get lost now.”

Since Shi Xuan had treated his kindness as weakness, he naturally had to make Shi Xuan pay a steeper price. When Shi Xuan broke free from the wall, he quickly crawled out of the hall. At this moment, he was filled with regret that he wasn’t as decisive as Song Rui. But it was too late for regret. There was no way he would reach the end of the Heavenly Path in his current state.

He knew that his enemies would come after him, which would make it difficult for him to leave the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. The crowd was in disbelief from Lin Yun’s actions.

“I need to get going. I have to get the Glorysun Constellation Palace’s inheritance as soon as possible.” Lin Yun looked around calmly. Then, he headed for the depths of the floating island. He had a huge harvest from the main hall because of the painting, bloodline, and beast core. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

If his suspicions were right, the inheritance was most likely related to the Golden Crow. It was perfect for him since the Divine Glorysun Fist and Sun Chasing Art were related to the Golden Crow. He could potentially improve both of his advanced fortune martial techniques.

Additionally, he might even have an opportunity to unseal the Glorysun Spirit. The Gloryearth and Glorygold Spirits could boost one’s martial intent, but they were external objects. It was no wonder that the seven heads of the Azure Dragon Ranking weren’t interested in them. But the Glorysun Spirit must be different. After all, it had to have a reason for being sealed.

Many figures appeared in the sky as they followed Lin Yun towards the depths of the island. As Lin Yun flew, he exclaimed at the majestic palaces and mountains. He couldn’t imagine what they were like in their heyday. Because of this, Lin Yun started thinking about how the Heavenly Path came to be.

“I simply can’t imagine it,” sighed Lin Yu. He knew that he should search for the true inheritance in the Glorysun Constellation Palace instead of wasting his time. Suddenly, beast roars echoed out from the mountain range. With all of the cultivators on the island, the demonic beast had started waking from their sleep. It seemed like the island was about to get even more dangerous.

“There are actually demonic beasts that are still alive?” Many people frowned at this scene. They were worried that there might be demonic beasts on the level of the Divine Firebird. Even Lin Yun was shocked briefly by the aura of the demonic beasts. He noticed that all of the demonic beasts contained blazing energy within their bodies, which meant that their bloodline had undergone a mutation.

“Well, it’s not exactly a bad thing for me,” muttered Lin Yun. He was pretty confident in his current strength and he wasn’t afraid to compete with others for the inheritance. He only worried that someone would take the Glorysun Constellation Palace’s inheritance before he got there.

“I can’t just look around and depend on my luck. I need a clue,” said Lin Yun while taking out the golden crow painting from his interspatial pouch. If this item was really related to Glorysun Constellation Palace’s inheritance, he should be able to sense it rather than wandering around blindly.

Holding onto the painting, Lin Yun slowly closed his eyes and used his soul to sense the golden crow’s eyes. Not long later, a buzz rang out as a dazzling sun appeared in his mind.

“Over there!” Lin Yun opened his eyes and looked northeast. He could sense that there was a blazing sun in that direction thanks to the painting. After all, he couldn’t sense anything special in that direction with his eyes.

“How useful,” said Lin Yun. An hour later, Lin Yun passed through the dense forest after slaying countless demonic beasts. Finally, he reached a serene valley. When he stepped into the valley, he saw a gigantic statue of a deity with golden wings at the far end of the valley.

“Blood… something isn’t right!” Lin Yun’s face changed when he caught the stench of blood. Then, he saw seven corpses lying in the valley with blood flowing out of their wounds.

“I’ve been waiting for you.” At the center of the valley sat a figure on a mat. He turned around to look at Lin Yun with eight paintings hovering behind him. The mat he was sitting on emitted an ancient and mysterious aura with lots of floral patterns.

Lin Yun got goosebumps as his senses told him that this person was dangerous. When Lin Yun took a clearer look at this person’s appearance, he quickly squinted his eyes because this person was Feng Xuanyi, one of the seven heads.
