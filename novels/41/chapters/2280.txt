Chapter 2281 - Come Back To Life!

The Ying River King gasped for breath while being at the edge of the Flame Dragon’s skull, his face pale.

On the other hand, everyone looked excited when they saw the Ying River King’s state.

“Flower Burial, how powerful!” Qu Wushuang exclaimed and muttered, “I thought that Golden-Eyed Demonspirits were invincible against those of the same generation. I didn’t expect that there’s always someone stronger in the world. It turns out that my eyesight was too low.”

It wasn’t because his eyesight was too low, but that was practically common sense. No one here could stop the Ying River King from reaching the Flame Dragon’s skull. Only the fourth-stage Saint Lords briefly held their ground but were soon defeated. Even pinnacle fourth-stage Saint Lords like the Heavenly Sage, Indigo Brave, and Crow Shot Saint Lords might be unable to stop him.

Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword as he coldly looked at the Ying River King. The latter gave off a domineering aura, but the Ying River King couldn’t become domineering in front of him.

“Another Heavenly Moon Blade?” Lin Yun was surprised when he saw the Heavenly Moon Blade in the Ying River King’s hand. If he remembered correctly, he had snapped the Heavenly Moon Blade. This Heavenly Moon Blade was similar to the previous one but looked even more demonic after being covered with a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit’s blood.

The Ying River King coughed out a mouthful of blood, his face becoming ugly. He had never suffered heavy injuries before. So, even if he looked pathetic, his eyes radiated with excitement.

“You didn't think that I only had one blade, right?” The Ying River King smiled. “The true Heavenly Moon Blade is a Sovereign Saint Artifact. This is only a replica. If the actual Heavenly Moon Blade was here, I could easily take your head from a thousand miles away.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled. Did the Ying River King think that he didn’t have a Sovereign Saint Artifact? If he wasn't afraid of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, he would’ve brought out the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear to suppress the Ying River King.

“What are you smiling at?” The Ying River King was furious when he saw Lin Yun’s smile, which humiliated him.

Lin Yun stood with one hand behind his back, and said, “Don’t you know what I’m laughing at? A Quasi-Saint like me suppressed a fourth-stage Saint Lord, and you dare claim that you can take my head from a thousand miles away?”

Lin Yun waved his hand, pointing at the Ying River King with the Flower Burial Sword, and coldly said, “Not to mention that I only used one hand against you. Ying River King, where did you get the cheek to say that?”

The Ying River King’s face changed as he became furious, but there was nothing he could say to refute those words, since what Lin Yun said was the truth.

“It’s not the end yet, Flower Burial!” The Ying River King furiously roared as his long hair spread out and golden runes appeared on his face, making him look sinister. He used the Great Yin Domain again and tried to suppress his opponent with his cultivation.

He absorbed the lesson from earlier and no longer competed with Lin Yun in blade techniques. Instead, he fully exhibited the advantage of his cultivation with each strike and his Golden-Eyed Demonspirit’s bloodline, which was a smart decision. But it was a pity that his opponent was Lin Yun.

The first ten moves alone made Lin Yun feel terrible, with his right hand becoming numb and a slight fracture in his right arm. But after the first ten moves, Lin Yun adapted to the Ying River King’s attacks. Using his Sword Dao as the base, he fully used his advantages, such as the Wind Dao, Thunder Dao, Azure Dragon Divine Physique, and the two sword canons.

Initially, he could barely fend him off, but Lin Yun soon retaliated, which made the Ying River King panic. The longer they fought, the more relaxed Lin Yun became, with his eyes shining brightly. Since he had a disadvantage in his cultivation, he had to fully display his advantage in sword technique, surpassing his limits to deal with the disadvantage.

The moment his disadvantage was complemented, his technique would turn into his dao, filled with variations that gave his opponent a hard time.

The Ying River King was in this sort of situation. He had a strong start in the fight, but he gradually noticed that something wasn’t right and his face became ugly. Just facing Lin Yun’s sword technique alone was a headache. It was accompanied by the azure dragon’s roar and the variation of heavenly dragon and divine phoenix.

Ten-odd exchanges later, Lin Yun’s sword became as fast as lightning, leaving multiple wounds on the Ying River King. Those injuries might not be fatal, but they would gradually become severe as they began to accumulate. Most importantly, the Ying River King had lost his advantage in the fight.

His aura as a fearless Golden-Eyed Demonspirit was riddled with holes under Lin Yun’s sword. This didn't happen even when he was facing a Sovereign Constellation.

After several exchanges, the Flower Burial Sword gently landed on the Heavenly Moon Blade, knocking it away before hacking Ying River King’s chest.

The Ying River King was completely vulnerable to this attack. He wanted to dodge the incoming attack, but he only fell deeper into Lin Yun’s sword as the latter slashed with his sword, causing blood to gush from the Ying River King’s chest before being knocked away. The process was smooth while Lin Yun fought with one hand behind his back.

When Lin Yun wanted to step forth, a fan flew over from his side, targeting the back of his neck.

“I have been waiting for you.” Lin Yun spun the Flower Burial Sword in his hand and knocked the fan away, which Zhao Tianyu grabbed onto.

“Divine Thunder Eyes!” Zhao Tianyu had been observing, waiting for the right opportunity to shoot lightning out from his eyes. As the lightning flashed, he managed to suppress Lin Yun’s sword aura.

“Die!” The Ying River King took this opportunity to charge forth.

When Zhao Tianyu and the Ying River King ganged up on Lin Yun, this scene changed Ji Zixi and Li Feibai’s faces and they couldn’t just watch this any longer. But just when they were about to step forth, Lin Yun’s voice stopped them, “Let them come!”

Dragon Sun-Moon Seal—Heaven and Earth Unite!

Lin Yun spun in mid-air as he divided into two, one as the heavenly dragon and the other as a divine phoenix.

"This move again!” Fear flashed across the Ying River King’s eyes, his face changing as space distorted before him. Regardless of the Divine Thunder Eyes or blade rays, they were easily resolved under the spatial distortion.

The Ying River King and Zhao Tianyu were then dragged into the distorted space and their vision spiralled as they fought one Lin Yun each. In the eyes of others, it looked as though all of heaven and earth was filled with Lin Yun within the distorted space.

“What sword technique is this?”

“Isn’t this a little too magical? I can’t tell what’s going on at all."

All the Saint Lords in the surrounding area began to feel their scalps go numb as they looked at the fight.

Zhao Tianyu and Ying River King felt terrible while being in the distorted space, but they were trying their best to break free.

“Moon Picking Hand!”

“Star Slasher!”

The two no longer dared to hold back and executed their dragon spirit martial techniques with powerful auras sweeping out from them. The distorted space began to crack like a mirror from the two attacks.

“Blooming Flowers!” Lin Yun no longer held back and executed the third section of the Divine Firefly Sword. The Sword Dao shone brightly like a star as Lin Yun spun eighty-one times in a single breath.

Whenever Lin Yun swung his sword, he would unleash eighty-one swords with the flower representing Sword Dao bloom for a moment before unleashing a barrage of sword rays.

For a split second, everyone saw hundreds, if not thousands, of sword rays with dozens of blooming flowers.

Zhao Tianyu and the Ying River King were sent flying away with tiny holes in their bodies and blood gushing out. But that wasn’t all. Lin Yun then soared to the sky, reaching out with his left hand that was behind his back with all of his attacks unleashed.

A sword ray flew at the Ying River King’s vertical eye when he and Zhao Tianyu landed on the ground.

“Watch out!” The Ying River King couldn’t respond in time, so Zhao Tianyu raised his hand to block the Ying River King’s forehead. The fan was a secret treasure that Zhao Tianyu could use as a weapon. But the fan exploded from the collision and Zhao Tianyu threw out a mouthful of blood while being stumped. “How is that possible?!”

The beam didn’t stop and had pierced through the Ying River King’s forehead, penetrating the vertical eye.

“Run!” Zhao Tianyu grabbed the Ying River King’s arm as he retreated.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he frowned because if it wasn’t for Zhao Tianyu’s fan, that strike would’ve blown apart the Ying River King and knocked his vertical eye out. He could have then taken the opportunity to destroy it.

Although the Ying River King’s state was terrible, it was unsure if he was dead. Based on Lin Yun’s understanding of the Demonspirit Clan, there was a high chance that the Ying River King was still alive, so his facial expression was ugly.

He wasn’t satisfied with the battle, but all the Saints that had gathered in the Flame Dragon Valley were dumbfounded with their mouths wide open. Many older generation Saints were also dumbfounded, with their hearts beating violently.

“Wang Muyan, how long will you wait for?!” Zhao Tianyu roared, bringing everyone back to their senses. When everyone came to their senses, they remembered that they still had to deal with the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. Wang Muyan had been injured by Lin Yun earlier, but with Zhao Tianyu and the Ying River King buying time for her, she must’ve recovered from her injuries by now.

“Time is sovereign while space is king!” Everyone's worries came to reality as Wang Muyan no longer held back. She raised her hands to the sky, making her look like a deity as the time and space seals revolved around her, emitting a terrifying pressure. The next moment, the entire Flame Dragon Valley began to collapse.

But if one looked at it closely, this was caused by the collapse of space. Many Saints fell into the collapsed space that felt like an abyss. The huge crack was like a bottomless pit that struck them with fear. No matter what they tried, they couldn’t escape from the collapsed space.

“No! No! No!” The Saints who fell into the collapsed space screamed in despair while being unable to do anything.

The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda gave off a powerful pressure as it descended under Wang Muyan’s control. The speed of the pagoda’s descent wasn’t fast, but it gave off a powerful aura. It's as though it wanted to smash through the entire Heavenly Void. Everyone was caught within the pagoda's aura and couldn’t escape.

“Lin Yun, we can’t stop it!” Ji Zixi exclaimed in fear with a pale complexion. Since the Heavenly Void was isolated by the God Burial Mountain Range, Sovereign Saint Artifacts couldn’t connect with their Sovereign Constellation, and the power of the Sovereign Saint Artifacts was greatly weakened here. So when facing the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, even Ji Zixi was under great pressure, even with the Divine Phoenix Mirror.

Far away, Zhao Tianyu held onto the heavily injured Ying River King while shaking his head at this scene. This wasn’t what he expected. Not only did Wang Muyan have to pay a great price, but all the Saints and demonic corpses in the Flame Dragon Valley would be eradicated just to kill a prodigy swordsman.

But Zhao Tianyu didn’t think it was a loss as he looked at Lin Yun, muttering, “Goodbye, Flower Burial.”

When the three holy lands who had already fled felt the pressure the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda gave off, they could feel a chill run down their spines and rejoiced that they had escaped beforehand.

“It’s a pity for a prodigy swordsman like Flower Burial to be buried there,” Liu Yunlan gently sighed.

Huang Jingyu, who still hadn’t regrown his hand, sneered, “It’s good that he’s dead.”

Liu Yunlan frowned upon hearing that but said nothing.

“Let’s go. There’s nothing we can do to the Blood Moon Sect now, and chaos will soon fall on the Eastern Desolation.” The three holy lands didn’t dare to stay around for long and increased their speed, wanting to leave this place quickly.

On the Flame Dragon's skull, after their initial panic, Li Feibai and Ji Zixi swiftly calmed down.

Li Feibai looked at the space-time distortion around the Flame Dragon Valley and gave up thoughts on escaping. Even when death was coming, Li Feibai still had the mood to joke around, “Flower Burial, how do you feel about having two beauties being buried with you?”

Ji Zixi had never thought of that question before. So, after being reminded by Li Feibai, she looked a little bashful. She couldn’t help herself as she turned to look at Lin Yun. What am I thinking about when we’re all going to die…

“Don’t worry about it. We won’t be dying today.” Lin Yun sheathed the Flower Burial Sword into his heart and spread his right palm, which had absorbed the Flame Dragon’s blood that he had obtained earlier, and condensed a crimson seal.

“What is that?” Ji Zixi asked.

“Do you still remember when I told you that the stone monument was the Flame Dragon’s blood?” Lin Yun asked.

Ji Zixi briefly pondered before recalling what Lin Yun had said. Back then, she was still curious as to why Lin Yun was determined to look at the stone monument.

“This is the blood from the Flame Dragon’s heart,” Lin Yun said.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“What?” Ji Zixi and Li Feibai exclaimed.

Lin Yun lowered his head to look at the Flame Dragon’s skull. He asked, “You must be furious that something that you have protected even after death has fallen into the hands of the enemy, right?”

The Flame Dragon was only left with bones. This made Li Feibai and Ji Zixi curious because who knew how long the Flame Dragon had died for, so how could it hear what Lin Yun said? They didn’t notice that when Lin Yun finished speaking, an invisible tear had rolled down the eye socket of the Flame Dragon’s skull.

The Flame Dragon was a companion of the Annihilation God Lord, possessing the true dragon’s bloodline. In ancient times, it could fight foreign deities outside the Kunlun Realm. It still remembered the Annihilation God Lord’s smile and how he died fighting to protect the Kunlun Realm without any regret. After that, the Flame Dragon kept its promise to the Annihilation God Lord until its death.

The Flame Dragon was the most trusted by the Annihilation God Lord, and it promised the latter that it would protect what the Annihilation God Lord left behind…

“Furious? Come back to life, then!” Lin Yun said with a dignified expression as he lowered himself and patted his hand on the Flame Dragon’s skull, pouring the Flame Dragon’s blood into it.
