Chapter 2146: Ongoing Competition

Lin Yun no longer cared about Mu Qianjue after casually tossing him halfway up the mountain. He then sheathed his sword and slowly walked towards the Dragon’s Head. He looked calm as if he did something insignificant. He didn’t look excited at his accomplishment. But what he did caused an uproar outside the Dragon Mountains.

“That sword earlier was too terrifying. It gave me a feeling that it can even destroy the mountains and rivers.”

Lin Yun pushed his dual sword stars and sword intent to the limit earlier, empowering them all onto the Flower Burial Sword. This was why his sword was able to unleash an earth-shattering power, unleashing a sword ray that was so bright that it shattered the Eternal Purgatory.

With that, Mu Qianjue was entirely defeated. If it wasn’t for Lin Yun not wanting him to end his journey so quickly, he would have just allowed Mu Qianjue to fall and lose the qualifications to leave his name on the Blue Dragon Record.

The defeat of Mu Qianjue also meant that the myth had been shattered.

The sword that he had executed shocked all the geniuses who were on top of the various Dragon Mountains, and they began to calculate how strong that sword was. In the end, they came up with a shocking conclusion: Ye Qingtian’s sword could easily kill Quasi-Saints at the Indigo Origin Phase, grasping saint dao. Even a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase might not dare to take his attack head-on.

The Astral Sword Intent wasn’t supposed to be grasped at the Quasi-Saint Realm. And yet, with his pinnacle complete mastery of Astral Sword Intent combined with his dual sword stars, he was simply invincible against those at the Quasi-Saint Realm. But they also noticed that there was an obvious flaw in Ye Qingtian’s attack.

“That should be his trump card, so Ye Qingtian will be harmless if you can block it.”

“That’s right. He has revealed all of his trump cards, and he wouldn’t dare to use his physique to clash with saint dao. After all, he had been dodging Mu Qianjue’s attacks throughout the fight.”

“This is normal. He’s only a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase and hasn’t comprehended dao.” Many people were discussing amongst themselves. They were shocked by Ye Qingtian’s strength, so they felt fortunate that Mu Qianjue stood out. Otherwise, they might not have even been able to last for a moment if they faced Ye Qingtian.

But it was a piece of good news for them now that Ye Qingtian had exposed all of his trump cards. A powerful opponent wasn’t fearsome, but an opponent with countless trump cards was.

“The myths have been shattered. The champions of the Heavenly Paths might be strong, but they’re not invincible on the Blue Dragon Record.”

“They’re from the lower realms, and there are countless geniuses in my Kunlun Realm. We’re not afraid of them.”

“The Twin Stars of the Eastern Desolation seem to be pretty calm. The Dao Yang Holy Son wasn’t injured after taking Mu Qianjue’s Phaseless Divine Seal head-on.”

“Ji Zixi is also calm. That little princess of the Divine Phoenix Mountain has been calm throughout the whole process.”

Everyone was discussing amongst themselves since Ye Qintian’s battle with Mu Qianjue had shattered the invincible myths of the Heavenly Path’s champions, making everyone look at the Blue Dragon Record differently.

“There’s still the final battle. I bet it will be an earth-shattering battle.”

“The champions of the Heavenly Paths are strong, but geniuses from the Kunlun Realm like us aren’t weak, either!”

“That’s right! Ye Qingtian has shattered the myths!” Everyone looked excited because Ye Qingtian had proven that geniuses from the Kunlun Realm weren’t necessarily weaker than the champions of the Heavenly Paths.

On the Blue Dragon Mountain, the champions of the First and Third Heavenly Paths, Gu Xiyan and Situ Yan stood on a dragon horn each. The throne was down below with many disciples from the many holy lands. They were all geniuses like the Twin Stars of the Eastern Desolation.

But the throne was empty for now since no one dared to occupy it. The surrounding atmosphere was weird because Gu Xiyan and Situ Yan, who were going to compete with each other formed a truce for the time being, while the geniuses of the many holy lands formed another faction below.

This was the Blue Dragon Path. If anyone could obtain the throne, they would receive the title of Blue Dragon Lord. There were many Divine Dragons, but the ranking was called the Blue Dragon Record. As a result, the competition here was intense since everyone felt that the Blue Dragon Lord was such a special title that even the Golden Divine Dragon couldn’t be compared to it.

To a certain degree, whoever could obtain the Blue Dragon Lord title would be the strongest of the nine mountains. As a result, the competition here was intense, and each of the holy lands’ holy sons gave off horrifying auras as they watched the battle between Ye Qingtian and Mu Qianjue.

After seeing how Mu Qianjue was tossed to the side by Ye Qingtian, Situ Yan sighed, “For the champion of a Heavenly Path to have fallen this far.”

Gu Xiyan was calm about it and replied, “The reason why champions of the Heavenly Paths are strong is because they slaughtered their way out on the Heavenly Paths, and they also possess shocking comprehension. Not to mention we’re embraced by fortune once we arrive in the Kunlun Realm. But in terms of foundation and aptitude, we should be slightly weaker than the geniuses from the Kunlun Realm, and having an excellent comprehension might not necessarily mean an advantage. What Ye Qingtian said is right. Which one of the champions weren’t ants who slaughtered their way out? If we forget our origin, it would only be a matter of time for us to be eliminated.”

Gu Xiyan was calm about it and he even expected that Mu Qianjue would be defeated. The champions of the Heavenly Paths were strong, but that didn’t mean that they were invincible.

This was how brutal the Blue Dragon Record was. It didn’t matter how much glory you had before since everything would be shattered if you weren’t careful. If Mu Qianjue could learn from his defeat, he might have another opportunity to reach the peak again. Otherwise, he would be crippled.

The champions of the Heavenly Paths weren’t myths, to begin with. Gu Xiyan only found it a pity that he couldn’t meet the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, Flower Burial. That fellow was a genuine myth, but it was a pity that he wasn’t there.

Situ Yan fell into deep thoughts because Mu Qianjue had given him a reminder not to fall into the glory too much. He asked, “What do you think of Ye Qingtian?”

“He’s strong, unbelievably strong. He might be invincible if he’s at the Indigo Origin Phase. But…” Gu Xiyan carried on in a disdainful tone, “They think too highly of him to put him on the same level as Flower Burial. The brutality of the Ninth Heavenly Path far exceeded all the other heavenly paths, and they have no idea how hard it was for him to kill his way out. It was an unimaginable feat for someone to slay a Saint while being at the Dragon Pulse Realm, even if he had borrowed the power of a Sovereign Saint Artifact.”

Gu Xiyan revered Flower Burial, but it was a pity that the latter carried too much on his shoulders and couldn’t turn up for the Blue Dragon Record. Even so, Flower Burial would still be invincible the moment he reached the Saint Realm.

Situ Yan was surprised as he looked at Gu Xiyan. The latter revered Flower Burial even though he never met Flower Burial in person. Amongst the champions of the Heavenly Paths, many people felt that Gu Xiyan wasn’t any weaker than Flower Burial and might even be stronger. But Gu Xiyan never showed disrespect for Flower Burial.

Situ Yan even knew that the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking initially wanted to put Gu Xiyan as the first rank. But after the Sacred Alliance asked Gu Xiyan’s opinion about it, Gu Xiyan rejected them, saying that Flower Burial would definitely be first as long as they hadn’t fought.

“Ye Qingtian has reached the end of his potential. He might have other trump cards left, but he won’t be able to turn the tables around,” Gu Xiyan said.

Lin Yun returned to the Dragon’s Head at the Azure Dragon Path. When everyone looked at him again, they had to look at Ye Qingtian again. Perhaps there would be a huge change within the Eastern Desolation and the Twin Stars would no longer rule it.

The Dao Yang Holy Son grinned and was happy with Ye Qingtian’s rise.

Ji Zixi said, “The reason why your attack worked earlier has a lot to do with your sword. Without that, your attack would have been much weaker. Ye Qingtian, am I right about it?”

She stood before Ye Qingtian, donning a golden robe that revealed her long legs. She was like a bright flame with exquisite features, giving everyone a feeling that she was only fourteen or fifteen. She was breathtaking, despite being a phoenix youngling.

He once met her before and even used the Phoenix Heart Song to help her make a breakthrough, but Yue Weiwei angered her after that. At such a close distance, he had to admit that Ji Zixi was a breathtaking beauty, and it was no wonder that her fame would spread throughout the Kunlun Realm.

When she looked at Ye Qingtian, there was a hint of fighting spirits within her eyes.

Lin Yun looked at the Flower Burial Sword in his hand, and smiled, “Little Princess is right. My sword is happy with your praise, and it asked me to thank you.”

Praising the Flower Burial Sword was the same as praising him, and he didn’t mind the deeper meaning in Ji Zixi’s words.

But golden flames blazed within Ji Zixi’s eyes as she became furious, glaring at Lin Yun.

].

“Haha. Ye Qingtian, our little princess hates people calling her ‘Little Princess’ the most. You’ve committed a taboo,” the Dao Yang Holy Son smiled as he secretly transmitted his voice over to Lin Yun.

At this moment, Mu Qianjue climbed up the mountain once more. He said, “Even without that sword, he can still defeat me. After all, I’m wearing three Glory Saint Artifacts.”

When everyone looked at Mu Qianjue again, they noticed that he was wearing a saint artifact, and there was a lot of damage to it. The saint runes were cracked with his blood flowing out, and they were surprised by Mu Qianjue’s attitude. This was because Mu Qianjue had let go of his arrogance.

Mu Qianjue looked at Lin Yun, and said, “You’re right. The champions of the Heavenly Paths were ants who crawled out from a mountain of corpses, and there’s nothing to be proud of.”

As he glared at Lin Yun, he gritted his teeth, “Thanks for fishing me up, but don’t think that I’ll be grateful to you because of it. It doesn’t matter if I can’t obtain a Dragon’s Head and leave my name on the Blue Dragon Record. I will look for you again, and climb back up even if I fall to the foot of the mountain.”

As soon as he finished, he jumped down the Dragon Mountain this time, allowing the momentum to bring him to the foot of the mountain.

“A defeated dog really knows how to act.” He Xuanjing said with contempt on the throne. Compared to the shock of others, He Xuanjing held Mu Qianjue in disdain.
