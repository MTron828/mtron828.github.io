Chapter 821 - Fang Hanluo!

“Zhu Qingshan wins!” The judge indifferently announced the winner, causing a huge uproar. Although the battle was one-sided, Bai Lixuan had yet to use the Azure Dragon Rage, not to mention that his origin energy wasn’t fully exhausted. The announcement baffled the crowd.

“What’s going on?” Pavilion Master Plum and the rest were also baffled.

“Zhu Qingshan went easy on Bai Lixuan. Otherwise, Bai Lixuan would be cut into three pieces. This is the reason why the judge announced his loss,” said Lin Yun with a sigh.

Bai Lixuan slowly started to understand why he lost. He lost because of the first attack, Soul Devour. When the attack landed on him, it seeped into his body without him realizing. Bai Lixuan couldn’t feel it because Zhu Qingshan unleashed a second attack to devour a tenth of his blood. If his sword intent wasn’t strong enough, he would have been drained dry.

Oddly enough, his sword intent wasn’t strong enough, which is why he got caught by the first attack.

Soul Devour, Blood Devour… there’s probably another similar attack. Lin Yun pondered Zhu Qingsha’s capability in his head.

“You won.” Bai Lixuan sighed while looking at Zhu Qingshan with a complicated gaze. This battle wasn’t the same as Zhao Wuji because earlier he had been suppressed. This battle, however, could have been won if he brought out his Azure Dragon Rage. Knowing this, he felt extremely reluctant to lose to Zhu Qingshan.

Since he already lost two rounds, his ranking in the top ten wouldn’t be high. The following battle was between Yan Long’zi and Yue Weiwei. As one of the three kings, everyone naturally had high expectations for Yan Long’zi, not to mention that his opponent was Yue Weiwei. Since they were from the same sect, no one was certain how the battle would play out.

“Princess, you can do what you want normally, but you can’t mess around at the banquet.” The Pavilion Master transmitted his voice to Yue Weiwei just when the latter was about to stand up. Although his voice sounded threatening, it was more of a request. After all, he knew that Yue Weiwei was the type who didn’t care about anything when she messed around.

Watching Yue Weiwei come down to the stage, Yan Long’zi’s eyes flashed with unconcealable desire. After all, no man could resist the captivating charm of Yue Weiwei.

“Wei…” Yan Long’zi began to speak, but he suddenly recalled something and smiled, “Junior sister, how do you want to fight? I’m someone who's kind to women. I won’t hesitate to fulfill your request even if you want me to surrender this fight.”

“Then surrender,” smiled Yue Weiwei in a mocking tone.

This instantly placed Yan Long’zi in an awkward position because he was simply trying to greet her in a kind way. With an awkward smile, he replied, “You really know how to joke. If I lose one fight, I won’t be able to fight for first place. I can’t just surrender, but I don’t mind exchanging some moves with you.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Is that so? Then I’ll have to thank you, senior brother.” Yue Weiwei smiled, causing Yan Long’zi to be lost in her smile. But in the next second, she suddenly appeared before Yan Long’zi and used her palm to hit him.

“This is my first move,” smiled Yue Weiwei.

Yan Long’zi suffered a loss as he took several steps back. The pain caused violence to flash in his eyes as he started to retaliate, but he quickly retracted his hand after he heard Yue Weiwei’s words.

Then, Yue Weiwei smashed her flute on Yan Long’zi’s head. The sound of the impact made many people’s lips twitch because they could imagine how painful it was.

This bitch! Yan Long’zi instantly flew into a rage.

“One more move.” Seeing the rage in Yan Long’zi’s eyes, Yue Weiwei pretended not to see it and chuckled before stabbing her flute two inches into Yan Long’zi’s right shoulder. This instantly made Yan Long’zi’s face to turn red from the anger. He wore a sinister look because the flute was even sharper than a sword.

“Senior brother, your physique is truly impressive. I surrender,” said Yue Weiwei before she retreated.

Yan Long’zi’s facial expression was nasty as he tried his best to repress his anger. Gnashing his teeth, he said, “Thank you for your praise, junior sister.”

“I’m not praising you at all,” smiled Yue Weiwei before she looked at Lin Yun and winked.

“She’s smiling at me!”

“I’m clearly the one she’s smiling at!” Her smile caused a huge uproar among the crowd surrounding Lin Yun. When Yan Long’zi saw who she smiled at, his face turned green.

To smile at another man while he was around was humiliating. It was more humiliating than watching Jiang Ziye save Wu Xiaotian. There was no way he could take this lying down, so he glared at Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun sensed the rage and killing intent, he smiled bitterly because he knew that Yue Weiwei was messing with him. There was no way Yan Long’zi would go easy on him when it was time for them to fight.

With the battle coming to an end, Yan Long’zi won ‘easily’ without revealing any of his trump cards. At most, he only suffered some pain. The crowd didn’t mind the battle simply because they got to see Yue Weiwei’s smile. After all, Yue Weiwei was really charming.

“Next battle, Lin Yun VS Fang Hanluo!” The judge’s announcement made the crowd jump with excitement. Another dark horse was going to see if they could topple Lin Yun.

Many people claimed that Fang Hanluo would lose his life sooner or later with his fighting style, but he revealed his fangs the moment he reached the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. His fighting style was completely different now. Truthfully, Lin Yun’s cultivation was lower than Fang Hanluo. However, Lin Yun could make a breakthrough into the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm if he wanted to.

Fang Hanluo’s eyes blazed with fighting spirit when he saw Lin Yun. “I finally get to fight you.”

“I’m also looking forward to our battle,” smiled Lin Yun. Lin Yun noticed Fang Hanluo ever since he lost to Yan Fang. He continued to show growth throughout the entire banquet, which shocked Lin Yun. It seemed like he could make a breakthrough with every battle, proving that fortune and luck were also a part of one’s strength.

“I’ve been determined to defeat you ever since your fight with Nangong Wanyu!” Fang Hanluo said with his eyes blazing. Although he looked more tender than Lin Yun, his grave expression told everyone that he was going to give it his all.

“Oh?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts before he continued, “Then we’ll see if you’re capable.”

It was against everyone’s expectation that the atmosphere between Lin Yun and Fang Hanluo was so intense. Not only did Lin Yun say that he was looking forward to fighting Fang Hanluo, this was the first time Fang Hanluo showed such a competitive spirit.

“Frost Star Explosion!” Fang Hanluo had a high evaluation of Lin Yun, that he viewed Lin Yun in the same way as the three kings. Therefore, he pushed his frost sword intent to the limit right from the start.

A boundless chill surged forward like a roaring beast. Fang Hanluo’s punch radiated brightly and was clearly a lot stronger than when he faced Wu Xiaotian. His aura even surpassed Jiang Ziye’s Heavenly Imprisoning Finger.

However, Lin Yun easily weaved his way through the blizzard while he accumulated his Azure Dragon Sword Aura. Suddenly, he sensed the weakness in Fang Hanluo’s attack and drew his sword without any hesitation. Overlord Sword–Thunderbolt Slash!

Empowered by the Azure Dragon Sword Aura, the Thunderbolt Slash was pushed to the limit and manifested a colossal azure dragon. The dragon flew alongside the sword with a power that shocked Lin Yun.

Fang Hanluo’s attack crumbled under Lin Yun’s attack. The attack was still at full strength and was empowered by lightning and wind energy. Fang Hanluo was surprised that his attack was overpowered and quickly retreated. He tapped his foot in the air to negate most of the force behind Lin Yun’s attack.

But just when he was about to move, his vision was full of lightning. Lin Yun successfully predicted his movements.

Is he trying to destroy all paths of retreat? Fang Hanluo’s eyes flashed with a ferocious gleam as he threw a punch. His unyielding and strong stance left many people shocked, including Lin Yun.
