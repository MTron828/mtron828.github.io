Chapter 1016 - Divine Blood Fruit

The moon was hanging high in the night as Lin Yun sat on a huge rock. In the Heavenly Path, the moon and sun looked a lot larger than they did in the Profound Amber Realm. They gave cultivators a strange feeling of being tiny if one looked too long.

At this moment, Lin Yun was enveloped in silver moonlight as his long hair draped his shoulders like a waterfall. The moonlight gave him a certain luster of divinity and gentleness.

Behind Lin Yun was a colossal silver giant that looked similar to the one Yu Haotian had manifested. However, there was a distinct difference between Lin Yun’s silver gian and Yu Haotian’s silver giant in that Lin Yun’s silver giant wasn’t enveloped in a demonic aura. Plus, it had a strand of silver flames that blazed in its pupils.

Lin Yun's eyes were currently closed as he practiced forming ancient seals with his hands. Close by, Pei Xue and Lil’ Red were protecting Lin Yun quietly. Pei Xue’s eyes were glittering with curiosity, concern, and rage. After all, Lin Yun had brought her away by force. When they finally found a place to rest, he also started cultivating and didn’t allow her to leave.

Whenever she showed any signs of leaving, Lil’ Red would stare at her and make her feel uneasy. All of a sudden, countless phenomena appeared behind the silver giant. There were jade rabbits along with a goddess blowing a celestial flute that made the surroundings look like a paradise.

Pei Xue was shocked as she stared at the origin of the phenomena, Lin Yun. At this moment, Lin Yun looked like an immortal who descended from heaven.

A long time later, Lin Yun slowly opened his eyes and spread his hands apart. Then, he turned to look at Pei Xue, which startled her and made her blush. Embarrassed, she cursed herself inwardly for staring at Lin Yun for too long and getting caught. Pretending she wasn’t embarrassed, Pei Xue asked, “You’re practicing the fist technique that Yu Haotian used, right?”

“Yes and no,” replied Lin Yun.

His reply made Pei Xue sigh in relief before her curiosity was piqued, “What do you mean?”

“I’m not practicing the fist technique itself, but the Divine Moon Breaking Seal,” replied Lin Yun.

“Is it that complicated?” Pei Xue asked as she was left baffled by Lin Yun’s reply.

Noticing her curiosity, Lin Yun didn’t hide the explanation from her. The Divine Glorysun Fist and Divine Glorymoon Fist are similar martial techniques. The classification of their grades aren’t fixed because the grades are determined by the cultivator’s talent. The power of the techniques would depend on the level of the seals, so it could be an overlord or imperial fortune martial technique based on the cultivator.

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t be satisfied with an overlord fortune martial technique, so he had been looking into the Divine Moon Breaking Seal since he came out of the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. Unlike the Divine Sun Breaking Seal that he obtained in the Glorysun Constellation Palace, he didn’t naturally obtain the Divine Moon Breaking Seal. It was troublesome to make progress without the guidance of the Glorymoon Constellation Palace.

“Have you already reached the manifestation stage?” Pei Xue asked curiously.

Looking at the moon hanging high in the sky, Lin Yun replied, “There’s just one step left.”

He was only one step away from reaching the manifestation stage. When his Divine Sun Breaking Seal reached the manifestation stage, there was a phenomenon of a Golden Crow. For the Divine Moon Breaking Seal, he had comprehended many phenomena such as the azure bird and laurel tree. However, Lin Yun wasn’t sure which phenomena he needed to manifest to reach the manifestation stage.

“You’ve already practiced the Divine Glorysun Fist, so why are you practicing the Divine Glorymoon Fist too?” Pei Xue asked with her eyes flickering.

“It’s a secret,” smiled Lin Yun. He had no intentions of telling Pei Xue that the Divine Solar Lunar Fist was a holy spirit martial technique

Seeing that Lin Yun had no intentions of revealing his motive to her, Pei Xue’s eyes flickered briefly before she replied, “If it’s just the Divine Glorymoon Fist, I might be able to help you!”

“Oh?” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered with surprise. Could it be that Pei Xue knew some secrets in the Heavenly Path?

“There’s a herb called the Lunar Soul Herb in the Yellow Sandy Plain. It grows by absorbing moonlight in the Heavenly Path. Refining it should be able to help you in comprehending the Divine Moon Breaking Seal,” explained Pei Xue.

“There’s a herb like that?” Pei Xue’s words instantly caught Lin Yun’s attention as he started asking for details. The herb itself was poisonous and was guarded by a powerful group of demonic beasts. It was also known as the sacred herb of the Demonic Wolf Clan.

Lin Yun briefly hesitated before he made his decision to find it. After all, the Divine Moon Breaking Seal involved a holy spirit martial technique, which would help him shine in the last battle. It was extremely important to him and well worth the risk.

“Are you sure about that?” Pei Xue looked at Lin Yun and continued, “Even if nothing goes wrong, there are a lot of people looking for us in the Yellow Sandy Plain. It’s wiser for us to head to the Four Phase City quickly.”

“And?” Lin Yun squinted his eyes and smiled, “Do you want to hide for the rest of your life? That’s not my personality. Since they want to make an enemy out of me, I won’t let them do as they please. I don’t care if they’re from the Ten War Realms!”

Lin Yun’s words left Pei Xue stunned because Lin Yun was a little too crazy. When dawn arrived, Lin Yun, who was heading towards the Demonic Wolf Clan, could sense that there were people searching for him.

Many of them were geniuses from the higher realms. He was surprised that so many of them were at the beck and call of the war realms. Just like that, a game of cat and mouse was starting.

The Yellow Sandy Plain might be massive, but it wasn’t large enough to completely hide Lin Yun and Pei Xue. In just three days, Lin Yun, Pei Xue, and Lil’ Red had encountered ten waves of assault. Pei Xue was injured in the process as half of her body was covered in blood. She was nearly killed by the leaders of two higher realms.

As for Lin Yun, he was doing completely fine. Although he didn’t have any injuries, he wasn’t having an easy time fighting. His movements were being restricted by the three Realm Sons. Whenever he wanted to start a massacre, he could sense three terrifying auras surge towards him. One Realm Son was enough to make him fearful, so they were keeping him in check.

If the three Realm Sons joined hands, there was a possibility that Lin Yun and Pei Xue would die in the Yellow Sandy Plain. So Lin Yun was forced to change direction four different times and he had to hide his true strength.

But fortunately, the Yellow Sandy Plain was massive. If he took a straight path, it would take four to five days of traveling full speed. Although Lin Yun didn’t hide his existence completely, he didn’t need to. The higher realms couldn’t restrain him, so he could always get away.

But the situation changed three days later. Aside from the three realm sons, the other geniuses from the war realms were also dispatched. Although they weren’t as strong as the Realm Sons, they were still a lot stronger than the Profound Lightning Twin Swords. At this moment, Lin Yun was starting to feel a little pressure.

“Something isn’t right. These people are taking it a little too far,” sighed Lin Yun as he wiped the blood off his lips. There were eight corpses before them whose blood was converging into a river. They were elites of the higher realms, which was a luxurious use of cannon fodder.

Over the past few days, Lin Yun and Pei Xue had killed dozens of geniuses from the higher realms. However, no matter how many people were killed, they continued their pursuit. Clearly, the foundation of the war realms was deep. Otherwise, it would be impossible to gain blind allegiance from so many higher realms by force.

Most importantly, the geniuses of the other war realms started to appear in the Yellow Sandy Plain. The commotion that was being caused was too great.

“They must’ve discovered your secret,” said Pei Xue after looking at Lin Yun.

“What secret?” Lin Yun asked.

“Your opportunity in the Azure Dragon Palace.” Pei Xue paused briefly before she continued, “They have a treasure called the Time-Turning Mirror that can turn back scenes to watch what happened in a given location. Your battle with the Profound Lightning Twin Swords must’ve attracted their attention.”

The Azure Dragon True Bone! Lin Yun’s eyes flashed. He had a true bone left by an Azure Dragon King with a complete divine rune engraved on it. It was possible that the war realms were attracted by it.

“But I’m part of the reason too,” sighed Pei Xue. Her words made Lin Yun open his mouth, but he ultimately said nothing. Since Pei Xue didn’t want to share the secret with him, he wouldn’t ask. After all, she wouldn’t say anything if she was unwilling.

“Did you hear anything about me?” Pei Xue asked.

Lin Yun raised his head to look at the injured Pei Xue. He knew that she was afraid that she couldn’t make it out of this region alive and would ultimately lose her life in the Yellow Sandy Plain.

“Bits and pieces,” replied Lin Yun.

“What did you hear?” Pei Xue smiled as she seemed to have made her decision.

Lin Yun hesitated briefly before he replied, “I heard that you have a treasure that can change the final ranking. If one can obtain it, there’s a high possibility that they can reach the top of the Heavenly Path.”

“Wrong.” Pei Xue debunked the rumor before she continued, “That’s fake news released by the Ten War Realms. I did have an opportunity, but it won’t affect the final ranking.”

“Hmmm?” Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that because he never expected that the news would be fake.

“The treasure is a Divine Blood Fruit. There are a total of three in the Ninth Heavenly Path and I’ve obtained one. The Imperial Feather War Realm’s leader obtained one, and your lover obtained the last one. The one I obtained is sealed within my body,” shared Pei Xue. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, a roar attracted Lin Yun and Pei Xue’s attention. They could see groups of demonic beasts charging towards them like a tidal wave. Clearly, the demonic beasts were being manipulated by someone.
