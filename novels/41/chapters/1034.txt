Chapter 1035 - Heaven and Earth Unite

The palm-sized Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix cried as they circled around Lin Yun. They didn’t have the grace of a divine beast. Looking at the two spirits, Lin Yun commented on their ugliness. “How can I possibly fight with these? At least I’m heading in the right direction. The Millennium Flame is really useful and there aren’t any problems with my cultivating method, but they’re just… so ugly…”

“I’ll just keep going,” muttered Lin Yun before gulping down the Millennium Flame once more. He recovered his exhausted vitality once more. Lin Yun didn’t suppress the fire blazing in his chest as crimson strands began to fly out of Lin Yun’s body towards the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix. At this moment, their feathers were becoming glossy.

The process was slow, but Lin Yun managed to persevere. Even with the depletion of his vitality, he kept going. When the two birds cried out happily, Lin Yun knew that there was no mistake in his cultivation method. He knew that if he carried on, the two birds would become part of his fighting power sooner or later.

On the first day, Lin Yun exhausted his vitality three times, which made the wingspan of the bird grow to two feet. Every time Lin Yun exhausted his vitality, he would drink a mouthful of the Millennium Flame and continue to cultivate. It was a luxurious method that not many people could replicate.

On the second day, Lin Yun exhausted his vitality four times, which made the wingspan of the birds grow to four feet.

On the third day, Lin Yun exhausted his vitality five times, which made the wingspan of the birds grow to eight feet.

Clearly, the Millennium Flame was powerful. Although his cultivation was still in the pinnacle third soul Heavenly Soul Realm, the Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans looked even more dazzling than before. If one looked closely, one would be able to see the golden glow coming from the flowers.

Every single time he finished cultivating, Lin Yun would be in great pain because the Millennium Flame was too overbearing. If it was someone else, there would be no way that they could bear it.

On the seventh day, Lin Yun had lost count of how many times he exhausted his vitality. As for the two birds, they were completely covered in feathers, which meant that Lin Yun had finally reached the threshold for cultivating the holy spirit martial technique.

Then, Lin Yun suddenly stood up, formed seals, and threw out a punch. The two birds charged forward as they released sunlight and moonlight respectively. When the two powers overlapped, space started to crack while the ground trembled.

Suddenly, the two birds emitted an ancient aura that belonged to the pressure of a holy spirit martial technique. If one looked at Lin Yun, one could see that he was enveloped in a holy light. All of this was caused by just a single punch that was equivalent to the ninth form of Divine Glorysun Fist and Divine Glorymoon Fist combined together.

“I’m barely at the threshold. I’m not even at lesser mastery… this is really different from fortune martial techniques…” Lin Yun threw a punch forward, but it wasn’t the genuine Divine Solar Lunar Fist because he was only using the two spirits to throw an ordinary punch.

Raising his head, the two birds looked no different from their phenomena in the past.

If he didn’t practice the Divine Glorysun Fist and Divine Glorymoon Fist, he wouldn’t be able to come this far. But Lin Yun could sense his vitality and origin energy getting quickly exhausted by maintaining the existence of the spirits. With a wave of his hand, he summoned the spirits back. Then, he began to release his aura in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

As his aura continued to surge, he matched the aura of a fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm in the blink of an eye. “I have to continue to cultivate or I might not have a shot against those in the fifth soul.”

Ordinary fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realms naturally couldn’t enter his eyes, but it would be hard to say if it was someone with a greater fortune. After all, there was a huge difference between the two aura oceans. If his opponent had trump cards to withstand the pressure of his holy spirits, then the odds of winning would be hard to calculate.

There were many geniuses in the Heavenly Path, so he wasn’t sure if there was someone like that. After all, even the three realm sons were deep and unfathomable.

“This isn’t enough. I’m only at the threshold. I have to fully unleash the Divine Solar Lunar Fist’s power,” said Lin Yun with his eyes flickering. The Divine Solar Lunar Fist had three forms in total, but every single form was terrifying.

Lin Yun swallowed the remaining Millennium Flame and began practicing in the courtyard. Now that he no longer had the Millennium Flame, it would be a lot tougher to cultivate. Every single day, he would rest after he was completely exhausted to recover his vitality. In the past, he could recover his vitality instantly with the Millennium Flame. But now, Lin Yun was trying to force himself to stop relying on the Millennium Flame.

After all, it was more beneficial to rely on himself rather than someone else. After another seven days, Lin Yun finally managed to grasp the first form of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. Both birds flew out of his body emitting a sacred light.

Roaring, Lin Yun soared through the sky while the bird merged with Lin Yun’s fist. Instantly, the surroundings and the birds changed as sunlight and moonlight radiated everywhere. In that split second, Lin Yun felt as though he could do anything. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Heaven and Earth Unite!” Lin Yun roared as a sun and moon flew out of his fist. Then, a Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix streaked across the horizon. After Lin Yun was done, his forehead was covered in beads of sweat.

When a huge crater appeared in the field, cracks began to spread out on the barrier of the courtyard. Then, a terrifying aura started to leak out. Lin Yun frowned his brows unhappily. Didn’t they say that there wouldn’t be any commotions no matter what I did?

Somehow, the barrier cracked. Fortunately for Lin Yun, only a wisp of his aura had leaked out. There were many geniuses in Four Phase City right now, so Lin Yun didn’t think that it would cause a huge commotion in the city.

Spreading his arms apart and landing by the crater, Lin Yun took a deep breath and examined the hole. He saw fire flickering in the depth of the hole that came from a cracked flame vein. Not only did his attack destroy the spiritual array, but it also snapped a flame vein.

“Pig, what did you do?” Pei Xue ran over in a panic and her face had turned black when she saw the huge hole. But when she saw what the abyssal hole was, she was completely dumbfounded.

“Y-you cultivated the holy spirit martial technique?” Pei Xue recovered from her shock a long time later.

“I’m still far from cultivating it,” smiled Lin Yun. Indeed, he was far from it because he had just stepped into the threshold of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. Plus, he only grasped one of the three forms.

“Is there any news about the three war realms?” Lin Yun changed the topic.

“It’s weird because there’s no news about them. But I can sense someone secretly observing me,” replied Pei Xue. She had no idea why the three war realms didn’t do anything even after they were humiliated.

“Someone is observing you?”

“Yeah, but there’s nothing they can do in the city. Furthermore, I have a feeling that they’re coming for you,” said Pei Xue.

“Looks like they’ll remain hidden if I don’t show up. Let’s go, call Lil’ Red!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. Those people better not cross his bottom line or else he would make them regret they ever lived.
