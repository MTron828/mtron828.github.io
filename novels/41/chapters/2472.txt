Chapter 2473 - 13th of Month Four

“This is the fusion of heaven and sword?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he experienced the fusion between heaven and sword. Looking at the damaged plaza and the Ice Emperor, who had a trace of blood on his lips, his eyes were filled with excitement. It was stronger than he had imagined, and he merely used a gaze to resolve the strongest attack of the Frostsnow Sacred Palace.

It might seem exaggerated, but the Ice Emperor’s loss was fair. This was achieved after Lin Yun’s accumulation in sword dao reached the limit. The other swordsmen wouldn’t even know where the profundity of this move lay.

Raising his eyes, Lin Yun exchanged a look with his master, and they both smiled.

“The plaza is destroyed...” the Dao Suspend Sword Saint said in a heartache.

When Lin Yun heard the Dao Suspend Sword Saint’s sigh, he smiled and released his sword intent. The rocks began hovering in the sky by the sword intent, looking like time had been stopped, which baffled everyone. Even the Dao Suspend Sword Saint had no idea what Lin Yun was trying to do.

“Reverse!” Letting out a burst of laughter, Lin Yun waved his hand, and the rubbles began piecing up the plaza, which was soon restored apart from the cracks.

“Lil’ Purple!” Lin Yun called Lil’ Purple after landing on the ground.

Hearing that Lin Yun called out to him, Lil’ Purple grumbled and complained. But she stood behind Lin Yun and placed her hand on the ground. The damaged runes couldn’t be restored, so Lin Yun had to rely on Lil’ Purple to help.

An hour later, the plaza was perfectly restored, and all the swordsmen who retreated returned. The swordsmen from the Frostsnow Sacred Palace came to surround the Ice Emperor, where the Ice Emperor sat down and rested. When the Ice Emperor opened his eyes, the disciples of the Frostsnow Sacred Palace began to ask him.

“Master, didn’t you two say you would use a sword to determine the outcome of this battle? What’s going on?” They didn’t see how Lin Yun attacked; they only saw Lin Yun smiling, resolving the Ice Emperor’s attack. All the surrounding swordsmen raised their heads and were eager to know the answer.

“He already used his sword,” the Ice Emperor said and looked to have aged suddenly. It wasn’t because he had grown old or his lifespan was severed, but his heart had become old after suffering a great shock.

“I was injured by heavenly dao...that’s the sword of heavenly dao, and just a gaze could injure someone in the Emperor Realm,” the Ice Emperor sighed with a complicated gaze.

Everyone was stumped upon hearing what the Ice Emperor said because they couldn’t understand.

The Ice Emperor pushed everyone away and cupped their fists together, “I have benefited from this battle greatly. Flower Burial, thanks for your guidance.”

Everyone was shown to see the Ice Emperor bowing to Lin Yun, a gesture juniors would use to greet their seniors.

“Senior, you’re too polite. We’re just having an exchange. I received Yu Qingfeng’s inheritance, so I became so strong. Regardless of this battle’s outcome, senior can try reaching the Deity Realm after the Heavenly Path is reforged as long as they have some harvest,” Lin Yun said.

Hearing that, the Ice Emperor laughed, “Hahaha! I’m fully convinced by you now. If you need help in the future, you can come and look for me!”

“You’re too polite,” Lin Yun smiled. He gave all the swordsmen present a great shock, and his courage impressed everyone.

“Flower Burial, you want to reforge the Heavenly Path?” The Dao Suspend Sword Saint asked as he came over with Skysolute City’s elders.

Nodding his head, Lin Yun said, “This is no secret. Since all the swordsmen in the world are present today, I’ll be honest about it. I will battle with the Empress on the Deification Ceremony, stopping her from reaching the Deity Realm. If I succeed, I will head to the God Burial Mountain Range and resolve the Demonspirit Clan lingering in my Kunlun Realm for hundreds of thousands of years.

“When I’m back, I will reforge the Heavenly Path. This is the wish of countless people, including Yu Qingfeng. I solemnly swear to reforge the Heavenly Path no matter what it takes or who stands before me. I ask everyone in Kunlun Realm to witness it!”

Lin Yun’s words made everyone present feel their blood boil.

“Okay!” Everyone cheered after coming to their senses.

“Ice Emperor, that’s some courage you have there.” A burst of laughter sounded as two figures approached and descended. They were the Flame and Blade Emperors beside the Empress. In a split second, the White and Black Emperors appeared beside Lin Yun, looking at them coldly.

The Black Emperor was no longer a mythical emperor but was still stronger than the Ice Emperor. However, the White Emperor was still a mythical emperor, and the Radiant Sword Emperor was also looking at the Blade and Flame Emperors.

With the three of them around, the Flame and Blade Emperors won’t be able to do anything today. Even so, the appearance of two mythical emperors made everyone in Skysolute City nervous.

All the swordsmen present cupped their fists and didn’t dare to show any disrespect to the two mythical emperors.

Before Lin Yun spoke, Dao Suspend Sword Saint led the Skysolute City’s elders to stand beside Lin Yun, showing their support. Yu Qingfeng might’ve left, but the Skysolute City had more than one emperor. They might be a little nervous, but they didn’t panic.

Four old men appeared on four pavilions in the four directions of the Skysolute City, and they were all emperors.

“Two seniors, why are you two here suddenly?” The Dao Suspend Sword Saint asked. No matter what, it wasn’t polite for two mythical emperors to descend on their territory, and this was a dangerous act.

The Blade Emperor saw through his thoughts and said unhappily, “So what if we came? Or do you think we came to tear the Skysolute City apart?”

The Flame Emperor stopped him and smiled, “Sect master, you don’t have to worry. We’re here for Flower Burial, not the Skysolute City.”

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint’s face eased, but he said, “No matter what, the Skysolute City will treat you two as guests. But if you want to take Lin Yun away now that my master wasn’t around, the Skysolute City won’t agree.”

The Blade Emperor’s gaze became cold and was on the verge of flaring up. The Flame Emperor smiled, “Please don’t misunderstand. We’re here under Her Majesty’s orders to invite Flower Burial to the Deification Ceremony. Regardless of whether Flower Burial plans to fight or surrender, Her Majesty has something to say.”

“So what if I fight or surrender?” Lin Yun asked, raising his brow.

“If you plan to fight, the Empress will give you an opportunity and defeat you at the Deification Ceremony,” the Flame Emperor said. He continued, “If you plan to surrender, the Empress won’t hold it against you and will even matchmake you and the Ninth Princess.”

Lin Yun smiled, “It looks like I have no choice then.”

The Blade Emperor stepped forward and asked coldly, “Lin Yun, are you sure you want to stop Her Majesty from reaching the Deity Realm?”

Shaking his head, Lin Yun replied, “I’m not trying to stop her from reaching the Deity Realm, but I just need her to wait till I reforge the Heavenly Path. With Her Majesty’s cultivation in the Quasi-Deity Realm, reaching the Deity Realm won’t be difficult for him.”

“Reforge the Heavenly Path? You?” The Blade Emperor sneered.

When Lin Yun wanted to speak up, the White Emperor sneered, “If not the Flower Burial, what about you? If we rely on a lapdog like you to reforge the Heavenly Path, the Heavenly Path would probably be licked clean by you.”

The faces of all the swordsmen changed. There were rumors about the Blade Emperor and the Empress, but it was too arrogant to say it blatantly.

“Who are you talking about?” The Blade Emperor roared and couldn’t contain his murderous intent.

“I’m talking about you. Who doesn’t know that you’re her lapdog, who tried to bootlick her for three thousand years but got nothing.”

The Blade Emperor released a powerful aura as crimson blades blazing with flames appeared behind him. He roared, “Bai Zilu, stand out! Today, it’s either your death or mine!”

“You think I’ll be afraid of a lapdog like you?” The White Emperor replied fearlessly.

Seeing that two mythical emperors were about to fight, everyone became nervous and retreated. The faces of the Skysolute City’s Emperors turned cold, and they drew their sword calmly.

The Flame Emperor glanced at them and wasn’t bothered. But when he suddenly saw a smear of light, his face became nervous as he saw the Radiant Sword Emperor drawing his sword by half an inch, and even the sky turned dark.

A terrifying aura of an Emperor swept out along with a boundless sword aura. The Radiant Sword Emperor looked at the Flame Emperor with a smile, but the Flame Emperor’s face changed when he sensed the sword aura. That was a Sword Emperor's aura, which meant that Yu Qingfeng had given Radiant his title and not Lin Yun.

As the Flame Emperor’s eyes dazzled, he saw Yu Qingfeng’s shadows on Radiant, looking at how he drew his sword by half an inch and had a gaze similar to Yu Qingfeng's. This made him wonder what the Radiant Sword Emperor comprehended in his fight with Yu Qingfeng, and why he looked more terrifying than the latter.

Before the Flame Emperor could think more about it, he stopped the Blade Emperor. Looking at the White Emperor, he smiled, “Whitey, I’ll play with you if I have time in the future. But it’s not appropriate to fight in Skysolute City.”

The White Emperor smiled, “Why would I look for you? This lapdog dare be rude to Flower Burial, and I’ll just teach him some principles of being a human!”

Stopping the Blade Emperor, the Flame Emperor said, taking out an invitation, “Flower Burial, we will meet at the Deification Ceremony on the 13th of month four. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Taking the invitation, the Flame Emperor left with the Blade Emperor.

The Radiant Sword Emperor also sheathed his sword with a hint of disappointment in his eyes because the Flame Emperor stopped the fight.

“Why did you stop me?” The Blade Emperor asked furiously.

“Are you stupid? Can’t you tell that the White Emperor is trying to provoke you intentionally? With the White and Black Emperors around, the Radiant Sword Saint and Lin Yun could kill you as long as the two of them held me down,” the Flame Emperor said calmly.

“You think I’m afraid of them both? The two of them aren’t my opponents!” the Blade Emperor said pridefully.

“Remember what you say. If you’re beaten up in the future, don’t blame me for not helping you,” the Flame Emperor smiled and put a distance between them.
