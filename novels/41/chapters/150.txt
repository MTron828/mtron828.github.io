Chapter 151 - The Last Treasure

Lin Yun appeared on the Sky Piercer Altar along with a scripture that instantly caused a commotion among everyone. Others who entered the Sky Piercer Altar only obtained a jade strip. Even if Bai Lixuan’s jade strip was dazzling with a strand of purple radiance, it was still a jade strip. It was ultimately still a Xiantian Martial Technique.

But Lin Yun’s scripture was clearly different. It was a Profound Martial Technique. Only martial techniques that exceeded the Xiantian Martial Technique would take the form of a scripture. Furthermore, everyone could tell that the Profound Martial Technique was extraordinary with just a glance.

Down on one of the lotus seats, Bai Lixuan’s face turned ugly at the scene created by Lin Yun.

“Holy shit! Lin Yun actually obtained a Profound Martial Technique!”

“Even Bai Lixuan only obtained a Transcendent Xiantian Martial Technique. Just how did Lin Yun accomplish this?”

“This boy is like a mystery. It’s hard to see through him.”

“Now that you think about it, he must be confident in placing his life on the line to obtain a lotus seat.”

The Azure Sun Realm opened once a decade and the Sky Piercer Altar rarely bestowed Profound Martial Techniques. The last time a Profound Martial Technique appeared was a few hundred years ago. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Everyone in the plaza was shocked, but it was understandable.

Whoosh!

Lin Yun descended on the Sky Piercer Altar under the envelopment of the starlight. He examined the scripture once he landed on the ground. “The Great Wind Scripture!”

It was an ancient-looking book with three words written on it, the Great Wind Scripture. This was a powerful palm technique. However, once Lin Yun landed on the ground, an uproar rose once more with everyone looking at him.

“A Profound Martial Technique? Just how did this sword slave get so lucky…” Wang Ning nearly vomited blood when he looked at the jade strip in his hand. The Sky Piercer Altar had only given him an Intermediate Xiantian Martial Technique. Aside from those Quasi-Profound Martial Realm old men, his harvest could be ranked in the bottom. He was insignificant compared to Lin Yun.

“This kid must have used a cheap trick! I refuse to believe that his talent is stronger than Bai Lixuan!” Wang Bo’s face was dark. He was clearly unhappy with Lin Yun’s achievements.

But no matter what everyone said, it was undeniable that Lin Yun had significantly benefited from the Azure Sun Realm. So much so that even with everyone else added up, they couldn’t be compared to Lin Yun.

Suddenly, the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party headed towards Lin Yun.

“What are they trying to do?”

“They’re not going to snatch it, right? The Sword Firmament Pavilion is such a huge sect. How can they do something like that in front of everyone?”

This unexpected circumstance left everyone shocked. They looked at the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party in bafflement. The Sword Firmament Pavilion was famous throughout the Great Qin Empire. Regardless of how their disciples behaved privately, they should still be upright.

But when they thought about it again, it was uncertain. What Lin Yun had obtained was a Profound Martial Technique that belonged to an ancient sect!

Lin Yun was also puzzled as he looked at them. At the same time, he held onto the token with vigilance. In a short amount of time, the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party had walked over. While approaching, they unintentionally emitted a strong pressure. All of them were accomplished in the sword dao and their aura would be released even if they didn’t do anything.

“Your name is Lin Yun?” Bai Lixuan asked, stopping a hundred meters away from Lin Yun.

What powerful sword intent! Lin Yun was inwardly shocked. As a swordsman, his perception was stronger than ordinary people. He could tell that Bai Lixuan was stronger than Wang Bo.

He judged the situation in his heart and briefly pondered before replying, “I am.”

“Very good. Now, there’s a great opportunity waiting for you as long as you nod your head. If you want, I can invite you to join the Sword Firmament Pavilion…” Bai Lixuan said softly.

His words immediately caused an uproar. So it turns out that Bai Lixuan wanted to invite Lin Yun into the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

“This brat got lucky…”

“Bai Lixuan is actually inviting someone to the Sword Firmament Pavilion? It looks like he views Lin Yun differently.”

“As long as Lin Yun joins the Sword Firmament Pavilion, his future will be boundless.”

The Great Qin Empire had four transcendent sects and they each had a high requirement for aptitude, comprehension, and martial soul when it came to their disciples. As for the Sword Firmament Pavilion, it was the holy ground for swordsmen.

Invite me into the sect?

Lin Yun’s talent made sense for Bai Lixuan to throw him an invitation based on his performance in the Sky Piercer Altar. If that was true, then this might be a pretty good opportunity.

But just when Lin Yun wanted to agree, he suddenly thought of something and asked, “I’m naturally interested in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. But what’s the request?”

Bai Lixuan was somewhat surprised by Lin Yun’s question. He pondered briefly and replied, “Hand over your scripture. It’s a simple request, so don’t tell me that you can’t accomplish it.”

Lin Yun’s heart calmed down when he heard Bai Lixuan’s request. So Bai Lixuan was ultimately interested in his Profound Martial Technique.

“I’m sorry, but I don’t think I can agree to this simple request.” Lin Yun rejected without batting an eye.

In the next second, the faces of the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples became unsightly. They were unhappy with Lin Yun for lacking tact. It was an invitation personally issued by their senior brother, but Lin Yun put on airs in public?

“Interesting… Do you think that you can protect this scripture with your strength? Don’t you understand the crime of possessing treasures?” Bai Lixuan smiled. “If you give me the scripture, I will be handing it to the sect. Do you think that I’m trying to take advantage of you? Well, since you don’t cherish this opportunity, there’s no need for me to bother with you anymore. Let’s go!”

The other Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples glared daggers at Lin Yun before leaving. This scene had exceeded the expectation of many people. They never expected that Lin Yun would reject Bai Lixuan so decisively. He had rejected an opportunity to enter the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

Exchanging a Profound Martial Technique to become a Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciple was naturally not worth it. However, it was another matter since it was an invitation issued by Bai Lixuan. After all, he would be offending Bai Lixuan if he refused.

If someone else were in Lin Yun’s shoes, they would consider it seriously. In the end, they would hand over the scripture.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two figures descended next to Lin Yun. It was Ming Ye and the grey-clothed elder. Ming Ye smiled bitterly, “Congratulations, Brother Lin, for obtaining a Profound Martial Technique. I’m afraid that this must be a powerful martial technique.”

“Unfortunately, it’s a little too dazzling,” smiled Lin Yun.

“You can save the trouble if you’re willing to take a little loss. Bai Lixuan isn’t wrong at all. Many people are looking at you with greedy eyes. A Profound Martial Technique might be precious, but…” Ming Ye sighed.

Waving his hand, Lin Yun replied, “Brother Ming, that’s not the case. Even if I only had a Xiantian Martial Technique, I still wouldn’t give it out.”

Ming Hua looked at Lin Yun, dumbfounded.

Calmly, Lin Yun softly replied, “If I give it away, it will mean that I’ve bowed my head to Bai Lixuan. If I bow my head, do you think that I will be able to raise my head in the future at the Sword Firmament Pavilion?”

It was easy to bow, but raising his head back wouldn’t be easy.

Ming Ye and the grey-clothed elder exchanged a glance. They’ve never pondered over this before. Furthermore, the two of them did not find anything wrong with bowing their heads to Bai Lixuan. After all, Bai Lixuan’s talent was there for all to see.

Lin Yun's eyes flickered and continued, “It’s fine if he’s stronger than me. But he’s the one that lost to me in the Sky Piercer Altar… I might not be stronger than him now, but that doesn’t mean that it will stay that way for the rest of my life.”

Lin Yun’s words left them shocked. They never considered this problem. While the three of them spoke, the Sword Firmament Pavilion and Demonic Moon Villa’s sect got together. Bai Lixuan and Si Xueyi seemed to be discussing something.

“What are these people trying to do?” Lin Yun was baffled when he saw this scene.

Glancing over, Ming Ye hesitated briefly before he replied, “It’s said that there’s a Palace Tomb in the depths of this Burial Ground.”

“Palace Tomb?” asked Lin Yun.

Ming Ye nodded his head, “In the past, this Palace Tomb couldn’t be approached. But for some reason this time around, the demonic miasma in the Burial Ground has thinned out. I believe the two sects must be trying to head to the Palace Tomb.

“It is rumored that before the ancient sect was destroyed, the sect deposited all their treasures into the Palace Tomb. If you’re able to take a single one out, it will be able to cause great waves in the Great Qin Empire.”

Without any ripples on his face, Lin Yun replied, “Even if there’s no demonic palace, I’m afraid that it won’t be easy to enter the Palace Tomb.”

He wasn’t interested in the Palace Tomb and treasures left in there. He had already obtained a large enough harvest in the Azure Sun Realm. Therefore, he did not want to be involved in any more troubles.

Nodding his head, Ming Ye replied, “That’s for sure. Bai Lixuan wouldn’t have joined forces with Si Xueyi if it was easy. Brother Lin, are you not interested? After all, you might have a chance with your Cosmic Treasure.”

Lin Yun was stunned. He naturally guessed something and looked at Ming Ye with a smile, “It looks like the Palace Tomb was your intention all along, Brother Ming.”

Before the Azure Sun Realm opened, Ming Ye’s face changed when he saw Bai Lixuan and Xi Xueyi. However, the situation right now was uncertain. Ming Ye wanted to head to the Palace Tomb just like the two sects.

“There’s nothing I can keep from Brother Lin,” smiled Ming Ye bitterly, “I might have some chance if the demonic miasma was still around. But right now… I can only watch the show.”

Ming Ye clearly came prepared with a treasure to deal with the demonic miasma. Lin Yun listened to Ming Ye’s words, smiling and keeping his silence. The demonic miasma disappearing had something to do with Lin Yun, but it would be bad if Ming Ye found out about it.

“They’re going to make a move!” Bai Lixuan and Si Xueyi had finally reached an agreement and left the plaza.
