Chapter 1512 - Ancient Demonspirit Corpse

The Blood Moon Sect was a relatively unique demonic sect because it wasn’t under the control of the Imperial Demon Domain. Back then, when the Heartless Demon Emperor swept the entire Kunlun Realm’s demonic forces and established the Imperial Demon Domain, he subdued every single demonic sect out there, but only the Blood Moon Sect refused to accept his reign.

The Heartless Demon Emperor beheaded even their sect master, but he still couldn’t make the Blood Moon Sect submit. When the relationship between the Divine Dragon Empire and Imperial Demon Domain became tense, the Blood Moon Sect took the opportunity to rise and became the powerful force it was today.

When Ling Qianye appeared, the surrounding atmosphere suddenly became peculiar, but it was soon disrupted when another roar echoed from the grey fog. This instantly made all seven demonic sects nervous because no one wanted to take the lead into the grey fog to clear the path for others. This caused a stalemate between the seven demonic sects. Thus, the demonic sects all chose to rest and occasionally exchanged information with each other.

Just like that, half a month passed in the blink of an eye. When everyone was running out of patience, they could feel the rejection from the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm growing stronger. This was because an unowned astral realm wouldn’t welcome any lifeform. After all, someone controlled the world's origin.

Although they could resist the rejection, they would be forcibly teleported out if they dragged on any longer.

“The Divine Dragon Bone’s aura appeared again!” Chen Kui of the Hundred Ghost Sect said in a deep voice.

The other chief disciples also followed his gaze and looked in the direction of the Blue Dragon Palace. They could see a blue aura spreading along with the gust of wind. When they absorbed the blue aura, they were shocked to discover that their vitality had increased, and they could sense a faint dragon aura being born in their bodies.

This wasn’t the first time, and everyone was practically sure that there was a Divine Dragon Bone in the palace, along with other treasures. But the grey fog made them all hesitate.

“There’s no need to drag it out any further. If we waste any more time, we’ll all be sent out of the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.” Qin Yue of the Blood Rain Pavilion’s eyes flickered. “We can only stay in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm for another seven or eight days, at best.”

In the end, the chief disciples decided to join hands to enter the grey fog. As for the competition of the Divine Dragon Bone, it would have to wait till they reached the Blue Dragon Palace.

The demonic sects were in control of a group of body-refining cultivators. So even if those cultivators were reluctant, they could only clear the path for everyone. When Lin Yun and the other body-refining cultivators entered the grey fog, the remaining party of the demonic sects followed behind.

But their journey in the grey fog was unexpectedly calm, and they hadn’t encountered any danger yet. When everyone loosened up, Murong Chen and Ling Qianye’s faces changed, and they both exclaimed, “Watch out!”

A transparent claw pierced through a body-refining cultivator and dug out his heart. When the crimson eyes appeared, it pounced forth and devoured all the vitality of that body-refining cultivator. The next second, an eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm body-refining cultivator was turned into a dried corpse.

Thousands of Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses suddenly appeared, and they were endless. Unlike in the past, the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses weren’t attracted by the vitality of those body-refining cultivators but surrounded everyone, instead.

Before anyone could react, ten-odd Elysium Core Realm elites were killed in the hands of the demonic corpses. This became a one-sided massacre that made everyone’s hearts sink. They were all frightened by this scene, with their faces turning pale, and they had never experienced the terror of the demonic corpses when they had previously used the body-refining cultivators as bait.

This was simply too terrifying because the weakest amongst them was at the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, and they had all obtained lots of saint fruits in the astral realm. So their strength had already undergone a drastic transformation.

But when facing the demonic corpses, they would lose their lives if they hesitated for a moment. What made them even more afraid was that the demonic corpses had suddenly become intelligent and ignored the existence of those body-refining cultivators.

The chief disciples of the seven demonic sects simultaneously made their moves and unleashed their full power. Ling Qianye unleashed a crimson moon in the sky, enveloping all of the Blood Moon Sect’s experts.

Tian Jue took out his myriad rune saint artifact and unleashed eight dazzling lightning bolts that protected everyone within their reach. Murong Chen waved his hand, and his nether energy formed into an array of corrosive power. As for Yan Xuan, he formed a seal, and seven crimson lightning bolts manifested into thousands of images, creating a powerful blade array.

One must admit that each of the seven chief disciples was unbelievably strong, but it was pointless because there were too many Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses. Only their eyes could be seen, so it would be tough to predict their attacks. Aside from top-tiered experts, the other Elysium Core Realm experts were nothing before them.

“These are the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses? Aren’t they a little too terrifying?”

“What the hell is going on? Why did the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses suddenly become so intelligent?”

“I knew the Divine Dragon Bone wouldn’t be easy, and we shouldn’t have been greedy. Now, we will all die here today.” Most of the cultivators were frightened by this battle. But they were surrounded by Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, and they couldn’t escape even if they wanted to.

When Lin Yun looked at the blood flowing on the ground, he inwardly sighed. He had already sensed that something wasn’t right earlier when the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses didn’t become stronger after absorbing their vitality. So this meant that the vitality naturally went somewhere else.

There was a high possibility that the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses had someone controlling them. A terrifying aura swept out from the ground, making everyone feel their scalps numb and their hearts enveloped with fear.

As the eerie roar echoed once more, the ground burst apart, and a corpse crawled out. This corpse was weird because it had a strange feature. The center of its brow was caved in, and it looked like there was a vertical eye.

This made Lin Yun’s heart sink because the appearance of this corpse was similar to those ancient fiends hanging on the Primordial Demon-Refining Tree.

“Hahaha! How many years has it been? I’m finally back! Blood, blood, all of you have to die here!” That corpse’s eyes were shining with bloodlust, with an exploding wave of vitality. That was the vitality that the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpse had previously devoured. All of it had been gathered onto this corpse.

But the body of this corpse had already died, and there was no way he could store the vitality. As it devoured vitality, the vitality was also leaking out every single second. But the voice of this Ancient Demonspirit Corpse was loud and didn’t seem to be dead at all.

At this moment, this Ancient Demonspirit Corpse really looked like a king, brimming with a domineering aura. Many weaker people couldn’t bear the pressure when they got close. They held their heads and wailed out in pain.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Taking this opportunity, Lin Yun came to An Liuyan and Xiao Yun’s side. Gradually, the chief disciples of the seven demonic sects gathered together.

Ling Qianye said, “This Ancient Demonspirit Corpse is already dead, and the vitality it has absorbed will dissipate sooner or later. So we have to join forces and suppress it once more.”

The other chief disciples naturally accepted his suggestion. Even if this Ancient Demonspirit Corpse was dead, the demonic aura wasn’t something they could resist, not to mention that there were so many Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses around.

Not to mention entering the Blue Dragon Palace, whether they could survive this ordeal was the question. Without hesitation, the other chief disciples gathered beside Murong Chen and Ling Qianye.

The seven chief disciples summoned their constellations and the inheritance saint artifacts of their demonic sects. The seven holy lights overlapped when dazzling divine lights shone before blazing into golden flames.

Through that, they managed to disperse the demonic aura from the Ancient Demonspirit Corpse, and the flames landed on it. The surroundings began to fluctuate, and the surrounding demonic aura decreased a lot, and many of the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses were also sent flying away.

“They’re strong and truly worthy of being the chief disciples of their respective sects. They’re so strong when they joined forces together.” Xiao Yun exclaimed.

“The saint artifacts they’re holding all have an inheritance, and each one contains a complete acquired divine rune. As long as they activate that divine rune, they might be able to suppress this Ancient Demonspirit Corpse.” An Liuyan said.

But Lin Yun shook his head, “I don’t think so. We’ll run up the mountain if anything happens. Running down the mountain will only result in death. We can save ourselves if we can reach the Blue Dragon Palace. So follow me at that time.”

“Again!” Ling Qianye roared. This time, they threw out their saint artifacts, and the divine runes in their saint artifacts unleashed a devastating aura at the Ancient Demonspirit Corpse.

As holy light exploded, it radiated like a bright sun rising from the ground. This made the Ancient Demonspirit Corpse let out a painful roar. But in the next second, the vertical eye on the forehead of the Ancient Demonspirit Corpse opened, and a chilling aura swept out.

The chill swiftly eroded the seven saint artifacts, and the light emitted from the saint artifacts quickly dimmed. After that, an explosive backlash, sending all the chief disciples flying back. But after this attack, the Ancient Demonspirit Corpse fell to the ground, and the surrounding Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses also froze on the spot.

“Let’s go!” Ling Qianye and others were shocked, and they knew that this Ancient Demonspirit Corpse wasn’t something they could suppress at the moment. They immediately recalled their saint artifacts and ran up the mountain.

But three people ran ahead of them. Lin Yun had activated the Azure Dragon Saint Art to repel the surrounding Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, then used his sword aura to cut open the demonic aura before charging up the mountain.
