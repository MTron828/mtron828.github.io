Chapter 2108: Cockiness!

Many people suspect that their eyes are fooling them. Ye Qingtian heavily injured the Bloodclothed Venerable with one strike and even crushed one of her arms. But that wasn’t the most unfathomable part about it. After all, everyone knew that Ye Qingtian had yet to display his true strength, since he didn’t even bring out his dual sword stars!

His dual sword stars were his strongest trump card, and he was renowned throughout the Kunlun Realm for his talent in sword dao. But he didn’t even use it to defeat the Bloodclothed Venerable, he just swung his sword.

Wang Yue was stumped as he said, “Didn’t Senior Brother Ye fail to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage? So why did his strength skyrocket all of a sudden?”

It didn’t look like Ye Qingtian’s strength had declined. In fact he seemed to have gotten stronger.

“Didn’t I say Big Brother Ye qualifies to be here?!” Bai Qingyu yelled in excitement. She was so emotional that her face was full of smiles and pride in her eyes. Who said that Big Brother Ye isn’t qualified to be here? Big Brother Ye is still the same invincible man that I knew.

She had seen how Ye Qingtian committed a massacre within the Myriad Graves Valley and witnessed how he became first on the Kings Ranking. Most importantly, Ye Qingtian taught her how to muster the courage and fangs of a cultivator. Otherwise, she would just be a fragile vase.

When Bai Yunfeng wanted to chase Ye Qingtian away, this made Bai Qingyu feel aggrieved. But this scene brought a smile to her face with all of her emotions vented out, and she even nearly cried out.

Bai Yunfeng and those from the other holy lands couldn’t refute those words. They were also shocked by Ye Qingtian’s strength. But in the next moment, everyone from the Eastern Desolation became excited. They now believed that Ye Qingtian was a genius in the sword, and his feat of defeating the Bloodclothed Venerable brought pride to the Eastern Desolation.

The faces of the mysterious Whiteclothed Venerable and Orangeclothed Venerable who were beside Zhao Tianyu changed when they saw this scene with shock in their eyes. The Scarletclothed Venerable quickly dashed over and caught the Bloodclothed Venerable. When he examined her injuries, his face drastically changed.

“Xiao Yao!” The Scarletclothed Venerable’s face changed as he looked at the Bloodclothed Venerable, who fainted from the pain. Blood was still pouring down from her shoulder. Because the Scarletclothed Venerable had a good relationship with the Bloodclothed Venerable, he didn’t hesitate to charge at Lin Yun, yelling, “Ye Qingtian, you’re courting death!”

Before getting close, he pushed his palm forth, unleashing scarlet flames that exploded in mid-air. A sea of flames appeared within a hundred feet that was about to engulf Lin Yun. But Lin Yun’s sword was faster as he swung his sword, opening a path in the flames.

The rest of the flames continued to blaze in the air, burning through the air and creating black holes, which looked bizarre. At the same time, the ground turned into magma. This cave was fortified, but the cave was nothing before the flames.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s faces changed. If a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase came in contact with the flames, they would melt on the spot. By relying on the scarlet flames, the Scarletclothed Venerable seemed to be stronger than the Bloodclothed Venerable.

“What powerful sword intent! His sword intent can threaten me even without using his dual sword stars. It looks like I have to fight for real!” The Scarletclothed Venerable fought briefly, and he could sense how terrifying Ye Qingtian’s sword intent was.

He no longer held back and circulated his saint aura, which felt like an ancient demonic beast had awakened with a roar echoing out. The cave began to violently tremble with the Scarletclothed Venerable in the center.

Everyone could sense that an ancient and evil aura was being released by the Scarletclothed Venerable.

“It’s the Scarlet Flame Demon Scorpion!”

“This fellow possesses the bloodline of the Scarlet Flame Demon Scorpion! The four venerables are really strong!”

“Based on his cultivation and the Scarlet Flame Demon Scorpion’s bloodline, it’s impossible for any Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase who has grasped a greater dao to beat him.” The Scarletclothed Venerable was an ancient beast, and legends about his race didn’t belong to the Kunlun Realm but from distant space.

The Scarlet Flame Demon Scorpion’s right hand became a claw covered in black scales. A powerful shockwave swept out when the claw clashed with the Flower Burial Sword. The Scarletclothed Venerable took three steps back before stabilizing himself, while Lin Yun stood in the same spot, wielding the Flower Burial Sword and calmly looking at the Scarletclothed Venerable.

“Damn it!” The Scarletclothed Venerable felt provoked as he charged even faster towards Lin Yun, exchanging ten-odd moves in the blink of an eye.

But Lin Yun remained in the same spot while easily fending off the Scarletclothed Venerable’s attacks. He was like a flowing river with endless power. When his sword ray exploded, Lin Yun exerted more force and sent the Scarletclothed Venerable flying away.

This left everyone shocked because this was beyond their expectations. They couldn’t believe that Ye Qingtian handled the Scarletclothed Venerable, who controlled the bizarre demonic flames and even possessed the Scarlet Demon Flame Scorpion’s bloodline, so easily.

“What the hell is Ye Qingtian? Didn’t he fail to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage? Isn’t his sword intent a little too terrifying?”

“Purely relying on his sword intent to suppress the Scarletclothed Venerable, who is two stages higher than him in cultivation. He can kill a Quasi-Saint when he’s still on the mortal path. He’s really a heaven-defying genius.”

“Hahaha! Let’s see how these people can continue to be so arrogant. They’re nothing before Senior Brother Ye!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Didn’t they look into Ye Qingtian’s information? He’s a Holy Maiden Killer, so how can a venomous scorpion possibly hold a candle to him?” Seeing that Ye Qingtian held the advantage in the fight, the cultivators from the Eastern Desolation became emotional with high morale.

Zhao Tianyu was also surprised; he now knew why Wang Muyan was having trouble dealing with Ye Qingtian. If Ye Qingtian continued to grow, he would grow into a monster.

Lin Yun casually swung his sword, and the Scarletclothed Venerable was horrified to discover that there was nowhere to dodge the incoming attack. He could hear the sounds of flowing water in his ears, and the surrounding space was filled with the intent behind Lin Yun’s sword technique. This made the Scarletclothed Venerable feel powerless. When Lin Yun’s ordinary sword landed on the Scarletclothed Venerable, it instantly created a wound so deep the bones were visible.

“Damn it!” The Scarletclothed Venerable felt aggrieved. As he spread his hands apart, his flesh began to wriggle before black spikes appeared on the surface of his skin. He had become a massive scorpion with a long tail and armor-like shell.

After transforming, the Flower Burial Sword only created sparks when it fell on the Scarletclothed Venerable and failed to break through the armor-like shell. The Scarletclothed Venerable was a Scarlet Demon Flame Scorpion. After he transformed, his strength and physique was doubled.

“That fellow’s physique is already comparable to an ordinary Glory Saint Artifact. If someone with an acquired saint physique faces him, he would probably easily suppress them.” If Lin Yun hadn’t used his sword, his physique and strength would have been inferior to the Scarletclothed Venerable.

But it was a pity that Lin Yun was a swordsman, not to mention he was a genius swordsman. Furthermore, it was also a pity for the Scarletclothed Venerable that he was using the Flower Burial Sword.

After Lin Yun activated the two glory spirits in the sword, he easily sent the Bloodclothed Venerable flying with a sword before stepping forth. When he stepped forth, it looked as though he had disappeared. When he reappeared, the sword ray he released dazzled like stars.

The Flower Burial Sword easily pierced through the Scarletclothed Venerable, causing blood to flow and dying the ground red. The Scarletclothed Venerable did his best to circulate his saint aura to heal his wounds, but his face became sinister. He let out a furious roar, unwilling to give up and still wanting to struggle. As murderous intent exploded from his eyes, he grabbed a hold of the Flower Burial Sword with both hands.

While allowing the sword to cut his palms, he controlled the stinger behind him to stab at Ye Qingtian’s head. The scorpion’s tail was as sharp as a dagger, not to mention it was poisonous, and anyone stung by it would be injected with poison. Even a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase would have to die. This was the Scarletclothed Venerable’s trump card. The Scarletclothed Venerable was proud of his stinger, so he roared, “Die!”

This scene shocked everyone because Scarletclothed Venerable’s stinger was too fast, and it was impossible to dodge at such a short distance. Let’s not mention that Ye Qingtian didn’t possess any saint aura. Even if he possessed saint aura, he would die if he was stung by it.

Lin Yun calmly shook his wrist, and the Flower Burial Sword spiraled. His sword aura was like a grinder that separated blood and flesh from Scarletclothed Venerable’s hands, leaving behind bones. As Lin Yun’s sword aura continued to spread, it didn’t take long for the Scarletclothed Venerable’s arms to be left with nothing but bones.

This scene was too shocking, leaving everyone dumbfounded. Lin Yun took this opportunity to draw his sword out and stabbed at the incoming stinger, calmly unleashing several sword rays. It didn’t take long for the stinger to be shaved like wood, and blood splashed from the Scarletclothed Venerable’s neck.

But at the critical moment, the white-clothed men beside Zhao Tianyu made a move. After he waved his hand, he dragged the Scarletclothed Venerable back, but blood was still pouring out of the Scarletclothed Venerable’s neck. The one wearing orange clothes quickly released his saint aura to treat the Scarletclothed Venerable’s injuries and managed to save his life.

In such a short period, Lin Yun had crippled two of the four venerables. But before anyone could recover from the shock, a cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s eyes as he turned to look at the Whiteclothed Venerable. He asked, “Who permitted you to make a move?”

This left the Eastern Desolation’s cultivators dumbfounded because the Whiteclothed Venerable was a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase who had grasped a greater dao. It was undeniable that Ye Qingtian was strong, but how could he possibly face the Whiteclothed Venerable?

But when the Eastern Desolation’s cultivators came to their senses, they became excited because Ye Qingtian didn’t seem to have placed the Whiteclothed Venerable in his eyes.

The Whiteclothed Venerable possessed the Heavenly Aquatic Serpent’s bloodline and was the strongest amongst the seven venerables. His talent wasn’t weaker than any golden generation genius from the holy lands. From a certain sense, he was even stronger than them.

“You’re talking to me?” The Whiteclothed Venerable’s eyes flashed with disdain, before he coldly said, “Watch your tone, Ye Qingtian.”

“Since you saved the Scarletclothed Venerable, you can die on his behalf, then. Get over here!” Lin Yun’s murderous intent was roused. The Scarletclothed Venerable wanted to kill him, so Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t let him live. Lin Yun was naturally unhappy that the Whiteclothed Venerable saved the Scarletclothed Venerable.

The Eastern Desolation’s cultivators were shocked by Ye Qingtian’s tone and felt that he was too cocky. After all, the Whiteclothed Venerable grasped a greater dao, and yet Ye Qingtian didn’t give the other party any face.

Wang Yue gulped down a mouthful of saliva. He felt that he was already used to Ye Qingtian’s cockiness, but he discovered that he still had to continue adapting to Ye Qingtian’s cockiness.
