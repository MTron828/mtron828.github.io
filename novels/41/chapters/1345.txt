Chapter 1346 - Don't Want You To Touch!

The zither music also wasn’t able to stop Qin Cang for too long. In just three breaths, Qin Cang easily destroyed the array before turning around to coldly look at Luo Shuyi. As immense pressure came crashing down, Tang Jing felt as if he would be torn apart in the next moment and Luo Shuyi’s life would be taken. As for Luo Shiyi, who was beside Tang Jing, her face changed and quickly appeared before Tang Jing.

“Leave!” Before he could regain his footing, Luo Shuyi grabbed Tang Jing’s shoulder and bolted away. If they waited for Qin Cang to make a move, there was no way the two of them could withstand his attacks.

Luo Shuyi was smart. The moment she saw Lin Yun climb the mountain, she immediately fled, dragging Tang Jing with her before Qing Cang could even respond. Luo Shuyi was confident that Qin Cang didn’t have the time to bother with her right now.

Everything went as she had speculated. Qin Cang merely glanced at them before turning to look at the mountain. The moment Lin Yun reached the summit of the mountain, Qing Cang quickly pushed his palm forth. But Lin Yun had quickly entered the stone gate and it slammed shut behind him, causing Qin Cang’s palm to land on it, and the rebound force instantly sent him flying back.

Shortly after, the mountain sank back into the lake. Qin Cang had sensed the danger and appeared beside the shore with a golden fluctuation. His face was dark, and he was feeling irritable right now. But his eyes were flickering and he didn’t lose his rationale.

Right at that moment, the Profound Sky Sect’s Greater Elysium Core Realm deacons and disciples arrived with Lei Jue and Xuan Ying.

“Senior Brother Qin!” They were instructed by Qin Cang to not follow Lin Yun if they found him because he would personally tail him. As for them, Qin Cang had instructed them to watch over him, and they had seen what happened earlier, which was why they rushed over.

“What should we do now? The Great Saint Origin might be hidden at the summit of the mountain.” Lei Jue asked.

“This isn’t exactly bad. There might be dangers in retrieving the Great Saint Origin. They’ll definitely come out after obtaining it, so we just have to guard outside the pagoda,” replied Qin Cang.

“But he might receive other opportunities with the Great Saint Origin, and his strength might improve.” A Greater Elysium Core Realm expert said.

“That’s what I want,” replied Qin Cang.

“He might even make a breakthrough to the Elysium Core Realm. At that time, no one will be able to suppress him,” continued that Greater Elysium Core Realm expert. Earlier, when Lin Yun and Qin Cang fought, this gave everyone a deep impression.

The two didn’t summon their constellations. Even if Qin Cang can suppress Lin Yun, Lin Yun also displayed a terrifying strength and was on a higher level than the other fated transcendents. So if Lin Yun was able to take a step further, it would definitely be hard to suppress him.

But Qin Cang’s face was cold and replied, “Even if he reaches the Elysium Core Realm, I also have a hundred ways to crush him. In my eyes, he’s just a worm that’s slightly stronger than mere ants. But he’s still a worm, so what if he reaches the Elysium Core Realm? You think he can transform into a dragon?”

He glared at the Greater Elysium Core Realm expert with disdain in the depths of his eyes. He couldn’t be bothered to explain because these people weren’t on the same level as him, so they had no idea what he was thinking.

Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan were there, but they didn’t dare to get close because of the Profound Sky Sect. But in reality, everyone else was far from the Profound Sky Sect, and no one dared to get close to Qin Cang after witnessing his strength. So one could imagine how courageous Luo Shuyi was.

“What’s the Profound Wither Key?” The Sword Emperor muttered to himself in doubt, standing behind Zhao Yan.

“There’s a rumor that those who obtain the Profound Wither Key will obtain the Great Saint Origin. But I didn’t think that Lin Yun had it. That bastard is really lucky,” replied Gongsun Yan.

“I’ve never heard of that before.” The Sword Emperor shook his head and looked at the lake.

“Senior, what should we do now? We probably won’t be able to obtain the Great Saint origin anymore, right?” Gongsun Yan said in a little reluctant tone. After all, he was still dreaming that he might be able to obtain some benefits with the Sword Emperor around. But thinking that Lin Yun had taken a step ahead, he couldn’t help gritting his teeth. After all, he had always been wanting to defeat Lin Yun ever since their battle back in the Sword Hidden Pavilion.

“Who says that I want the Great Saint Origin?” The Sword Emperor showed a weird look at Gongsun Yan, leaving Gongsun Yan briefly stunned before wearing an awkward expression after he recovered from his shock. After all, how could the Great Saint Origin enter the eyes of the Sword Emperor? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Gongsun Yan couldn’t help muttering inwardly about why the Sword Emperor wanted to look for the Great Saint Origin since he didn’t want it. But he didn’t dare to ask because the Sword Emperor wasn’t someone he could provoke, even if he didn’t come with his real body.

“Gongsun Yan, what are you muttering about? I can sense a chill coming from you since we come out of the palace. Don’t tell me that you’re being possessed by a ghost?” Zhao Yan said while looking at Gongsun Yan.

“What the hell are you talking about? You’re the one possessed by a ghost!” Gongsun Yan was guilty at first, but he was unhappy when he heard what Zhao Yan said and rebuked him.

“Haha.” Zhao Yan didn’t say a word and looked at the Sword Emperor behind him. Ever since they came out of the palace, Zhao Yan realized that he couldn’t calm down because he could sense someone staring at him.

Taking two steps forth, he suddenly struck forth with his fingers. The Sword Emperor merely smiled when he saw this scene. Just when Zhao Yan’s fingers were about to reach his forehead, he suddenly made a move and his fingers tapped on Zhao Yan’s forehead, instead.

This made Zhao Yan’s mind blow up and his eyes light up. But in the next moment, Zhao Yan became dazed as if his soul had been extracted from his body. At the same time, his expression also became stiff like a statue.

When Gongsun Yan saw this scene, his mouth was wide open, and his eyes had turned red. Could this be an opportunity bestowed by the Sword Emperor? He then emotionally asked, “S-Senior, why don’t you give me some guidance? My heart as a swordsman can be proven by the sun and moon, and I’m someone who possesses the same dignity as you.”

“You can’t cut it,” smiled the Sword Emperor.

“D-Don’t. Senior, I’m willing to kneel to you,” said Gongsun Yan as he went down on his knees.

But the Sword Emperor smiled before he said, “I’m saying that you’re more stupid and I need to smack you in your head instead of tapping on your forehead.”

When he was done, the Sword Emperor smacked Gongsun Yan’s head. In the next second, boundless information began to enter Gongsun Yan’s mind as comprehension involved in the sword dao began to pour in. Just like that, he and Zhao Yan were like statues, one standing while the other kneeling.

“Gongsun Yan, taking this smack from me, if you dare to kneel before someone else again in the future, then I’ll kill you with a sword, no matter where you are!” The Sword Emperor’s cold voice resounded within Gongsun Yan’s mind. The Sword Emperor then turned into a streak of light and entered the lake.

Within the stone gate, when Lin Yun regained his footing, he immediately took a pellet to recover from his injuries. After he made an entire cycle with the Iris Sword Sutra, he opened his eyes and let out a long breath. “Qin Cang is truly famed as the first on the Empyrean Ranking. Wait, he should be stronger than rumored.”

“Junior Brother, you’re already very strong!” Jiang Lichen said. “You and Qin Cang are both evenly matched. That means that aside from Qin Cang, you’re already invincible on the Empyrean Ranking.”

The others weren’t surprised when they heard that because that really seemed to be the case. If news got out, it would definitely cause a huge fluctuation in the Ancient Barren Domain, not to mention that Lin Yun had only arrived in the Kunlun Realm for half a year.

“Evenly matched?” Lin Yun shook his head and said, “I have trump cards, but he also has trump cards. It’s just that he didn’t bring out his constellation nor did he use his full strength. If it was not for Luo Shuyi’s help, it wouldn’t have been easy for me to enter the stone gate.”

Lin Yun’s arrival in the Kunlun Realm was too short, and his foundation was naturally incomparable to Qin Cang. He could only use his firmament sword intent to make up for it, but the gap between their cultivations was too great. Compared to Qin Cang, he still couldn’t be evenly matched.

Ye Ziling locked his brows together and said, “How did he know so many Dragon Clan martial techniques? He’s not royalty from the Divine Dragon Empire, so there’s something weird about him.”

“Not only royalty from the Divine Dragon Empire can learn Dragon Clan martial techniques,” said Su Ziyao while she helped Lin Yun up.

“Let’s look for the Great Saint Origin first. It should be here,” said Lin Yun. Inside of the stone gate was a damp passage, and they walked for an hour before their eyes lit up. There was another mountain that appeared before them. This mountain wasn’t huge, and it was shrouded in a sacred light and herbal fragrance. On the mountain, rare saint elixirs could be seen everywhere.

“Oh my god! This is an herbal field, and they’re at least three thousand years old! If I can get a few, I can reach the Greater Elysium Core Realm in half an hour, and I can even try to reach the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm in a year!” Jiang Lichen said in excitement.

Ye Ziling’s eyes also shone brightly because she was also shocked by this herbal field. Lin Yun had obtained ten saint elixirs, and it was already a huge harvest in their eyes. But saint elixirs could be seen everywhere here, and this made them emotional. When they swept their gazes at the mountain, they couldn’t tell how many saint elixirs were there.

“T-This is too extravagant…” Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan’s breathing also became hurried as they looked at the herbal field.

“Something’s not right. The light of the saint elixirs seems to be focused at the summit.” Ye Ziling suddenly said because the light emitted from the saint elixirs was flowing to the summit of the mountain.

“The Great Saint Origin should be at the summit.,” said Su Ziyao, before she handed the Profound Wither Key to Lin Yun. But just when she was about to say something, everyone else aside from Lin Yun was suddenly frozen.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun held onto the Profound Wither Key as he tried to touch Su Ziyao, but his hand immediately bounced off. Everyone was enveloped in a black and white light, making this situation seem weird.

“Drifting like a duckweed for half a lifetime to be wrecked by the cold-hearted rain; the life of the catkins is akin to an incense, withering with the wind.” An elderly voice suddenly resounded.

From the light at the summit of the mountain, a white-haired elder walked out and waved his hand. The Flower Burial Sword suddenly flew out from Lin Yun’s sword box. This made Lin Yun surprised before he reached out and recalled the Flower Burial Sword back to his hand.

This scene made the white-haired elder surprised because he didn’t expect that the Flower Burial Sword would have acknowledged a new owner. Looking at Lin Yun’s cautious expression, he said, “Young man, there’s no need to be anxious. It has been a long time since I’ve seen that sword. I have no enmity towards you. I’m Profound Wither.”

“I know you have no enmity. I just don’t want you to touch my sword,” replied Lin Yun.
