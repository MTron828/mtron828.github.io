Chapter 2117 - Aggrieved (2)

“This scumbag’s actual appearance looks better,” Lil’ Purple smiled as she stood on the Phoenix Tree, looking at Lin Yun.

Once Lin Yun flew over, he stabbed the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear into the ground before sighing with relief. He had finally subdued the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear. The process was dangerous, but he ultimately succeeded.

If he didn’t have the Blue Dragon Bone and Lil’ Purple’s help, even a Saint might have been unable to subdue the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear, not to mention Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun joined up with Lil’ Purple, he told her about the general situation with the spear.

“This is weird. How did this Buddhist Cult’s Emperor Artifact become related to the Blood Moon Sect?” Lil’ Purple was baffled.

“Perhaps it is as Zhao Tianyu said, the Golden Lotus Flametree was given to the Fleeting Sky Monastery by the Blood Moon Sect,” Lin Yun said.

Lil’ Purple briefly pondered before she shared her speculation, “There’s also another possibility. It is possible that the Fleeting Sky Monastery was a hidden chess piece of the Blood Moon Sect.”

Lin Yun was briefly startled before he smiled, “Your thoughts are really bold. I’m more worried about what he was trying to do with it. After all, there’s no need to use ten droplets of divine blood for a Sovereign Saint Artifact.”

Lil’ Purple’s eyes shone, and she smiled, “You’ve already guessed it, didn’t you?”

“Do you think so?” Lin Yun asked.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Zhao Tianyu must have a way to undo the three seals on the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear. The moment the three seals are unleashed, the answer will be revealed. He probably planned on using this spear to confront the Heavenly Dao Sect’s Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword.”

“I share the same thought as well. But when it’s sealed, even a saint can’t withstand it, not to mention after the three seals are undone. This spear would probably devour even a saint,” Lin Yun said. “Most importantly, this Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear has been sleeping for a long time and has been greatly weakened. If the three seals were forcibly lifted, the spear would most likely be destroyed.”

The speculation was reasonable, but Lil’ Purple could tell that Lin Yun wasn’t too willing to believe that the Blood Moon Sect would be so bold, and he also didn’t want a catastrophe to fall on the Heavenly Dao Sect.

But Lil’ Purple wasn’t too bothered about it. Lin Yun was the only person she cared about. This was why she could see through this matter more clearly.

“You should’ve discovered that the Heavenly Dao Sect is on the verge of collapse since the sect master’s position as been empty for a long time,” Lil’ Purple analyzed calmly. “The four clans are like parasites attached to it, sucking the Heavenly Dao Sect’s blood. Their hearts are no longer united with the Heavenly Dao Sect. They only care about their own interests. Not to mention that the Wang Clan has an unclear relationship with the Blood Moon Sect, and the Ye Clan is filled with conflicts. You’ve just displayed your talent, and yet the Ye Clan’s ancestor wanted to kill you. You will probably have to leave the Heavenly Dao Sect without your senior brother.

“The Zhang Clan is even more absurd because their descendants know about the Dragon Clan’s martial techniques. They have probably become the Divine Dragon Empire’s lackeys long ago. As for the Bai Clan, just look at how they treated Bao Shuying. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint isn’t willing to interfere with Bai Clan’s affairs, so you can tell that the Bai Clan is already rotten to the core.”

Various indications showed that the Heavenly Dao Sect had been in a mess since long ago. If the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword weren’t around, the Heavenly Dao Sect would have probably been invaded by now. In reality, the title of the ‘Strongest Holy Land in Eastern Desolation’ was only in name.

Lin Yun wasn’t willing to think about that because he had stayed at the Heavenly Dao Sect for so long and already had some feelings for the sect. But he couldn’t deny what Lil’ Purple said because it was true. The four clans were like leeches; their descendants even occupied many saint disciple positions.

Lil’ Purple was pretty open about it and continued, “Nothing lasts forever. Even an immortal holy land will be destroyed; I have seen plenty of them. You don’t have to be too bothered because even those from the Heavenly Dao Sect don’t care about it. If what Wang Muyan did was done in other holy lands, she would’ve been taken down long ago with no evidence needed. The Heavenly Dao Sect is just a part of your journey and nothing much beyond that.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling a little sorrow when he heard that. But his expression gradually became grave when he looked at the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear. The Heavenly Dao Sect was like a luxurious giant tree on the outside but riddled with pests. Even a good person would be excluded by everyone, or they could only take care of themselves.

The Sword Sect might not be a holy land, when compared to the Heavenly Dao Sect, but the entire sect was united. To this very day, he still remembered the oath that everyone made when they just joined the sect.

I hereby swear that one day, the Sword Sect will return to become a holy land. Eight thousand years of reign with our halo enveloping ninety thousand miles. As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies! As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies!

Lin Yun recollected his thoughts and tossed them to the back of his mind. He briefly rested, planning to visit the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

“Remember to execute the Divine Tortoise Transformation again,” Lil’ Purple said before Lin Yun left.

When Lin Yun came out of the Iris Secret Realm, he executed the Divine Tortoise Transformation. He returned to Ye Qingtian’s appearance before he came to the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s residence. He had the Great Saint medal so that he could enter unhindered.

It didn’t take long for him to meet the Dragon Origin Great Saint. Surprisingly, the Dragon Origin Great Saint looked pretty energetic, and he was even in the mood to fish.

“Master.” Lin Yun bowed as he came forth.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint looked at Lin Yun and had guilt on his face. He helplessly said, “I failed. I nearly lost my life within the Divine Dragon Grave and failed to obtain a Divine Blood Fruit. It would have been fine if I didn’t manage to find it. But I was ganged up on by a group of bastards after finding it!”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint was furious. He initially didn’t want to share his experience with Lin Yun, but he couldn’t hold back when he saw his disciple. As he spoke, he began to tear up.

Seeing this, Lin Yun knew he had to be frank and said, “Master, please calm down. I actually have a Divine Blood Fruit.”

“You have a Divine Blood Fruit? Don’t bluff me,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said.

“I really do have one.” Lin Yun immediately took out his Divine Blood Fruit, leaving the Dragon Origin Great Saint stumped. The Dragon Origin Great Saint could initially still hold back his tears, but the tears began to roll down his cheeks when he saw the Divine Blood Fruit.

“Why the hell didn’t you tell me about it? Do you know what I’ve experienced at the Divine Dragon Grave?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint looked aggrieved as he cried.
