Chapter 1850 - Fully Armed With Glory Saint Artifacts (2)

Outside the Black Tortoise Void Sea, everyone had practically come out of the Black Thunder Palace. So there were a lot of people gathered outside the Black Tortoise Void Sea, and they had been staying there for half a month.

Everyone naturally knew why they were there, they were all waiting for Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun had obtained nearly 70% of the treasures in the Black Tortoise Vault, including the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. This greatly embarrassed the various holy lands and Demonic Ranking’s demonic cultivators.

Lin Yun managed to suppress everyone at the Black Tortoise Vault because of the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, and no one could stand in his way. There was a stubborn one like Yu Wenxiu, and he was mercilessly slaughtered by Lin Yun. But once they were outside, they didn’t have those concerns.

All of the holy lands had their own experts who sealed their cultivation to enter the Black Tortoise Void Sea because everyone could only exert the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage there. But once they left, they no longer had any reservations. Now that everyone was out, the demonic cultivators were shocked to notice that there were many at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage. The six holy lands had a shocking foundation.

Even if Yan Chihuo and the others weren’t direct disciples of the holy lands, they still had a high chance of growing into a powerhouse. So it wasn’t surprising that the holy lands would dispatch Nirvana Stage deacons to protect them. To holy lands, they could send out Quasi-Saints if they were willing.

But the Black Tortoise Void Sea was too bizarre. The higher one’s cultivation, the stronger the shackles were on them. So Quasi-Saints would have to weigh the pros and cons because every Quasi-Saint had a chance of reaching the Saint Realm. If they were dead within the Black Tortoise Void Sea, it would be an immense loss to the holy lands.

Most importantly, they didn’t have much information about the Black Tortoise Void Sea. If they knew that the Black Tortoise Vault was going to appear, even Saints would take the risk of coming here.

There were many rumors that the Black Tortoise’s inheritance could be found within the Black Tortoise Void Sea, and many saints have scouted the place. But they all returned empty-handed, and everyone gradually forgot about it.

Speaking of which, it was an irony that everyone and even those at the Nirvana Stage lost the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown to Lin Yun, who was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“It has almost been half a month… but that fellow is still not coming out?” Huang Xuanyi looked at the Black Tortoise Void Sea with a gloomy expression. There was a blood feud between the Ming Cult and Lin Yun.

Back at the Black Tortoise Vault, Lin Yun had killed Yu Wenxiu in public. So there was no way they could allow him to leave, even if he didn’t obtain the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, regardless of his identity.

“That fellow won’t die in there, right?” The Heavenly Flame Sect’s Yan Chihuo said.

“That’s impossible. His fortune is strong since he had just reached first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. So how can he die so easily? Even if he suffered the backlash of the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, he should have recovered after so long.” The Myriad Lightning Sect’s Yi Feng said.

“Perhaps he has other opportunities?” The Divine Dao Pavilion’s Lin Qingyang said.

When he said that, jealousy filled Huang Xuanyi’s pupils, and he said, “Isn’t that fellow a little too lucky? I can’t imagine what other opportunities he ran into, aside from the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.”

Yan Chihuo furrowed his brows and he could faintly sense what Lin Qingyang said might be right. He initially didn’t want to be involved in this muddy water any longer. But there was news from his sect that the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown might be a Sovereign Saint Artifact. So they couldn’t allow Lin Yun to leave, no matter what.

Even if Lin Yun was the disciple of the Azure Dragon’s lineage and Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain, they had to hold him here, no matter what. The Heavenly Flame Sect was dispatching a Quasi-Saint from Heavenly Domain City.

A Saint from the sect was on the way, and even the sect master was alarmed. The value of the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown had far surpassed their imagination. That was probably the case for the other holy lands as well. If the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown was really a Sovereign Saint Artifact, Yan Chihuo wouldn’t be surprised if even the sect master comes personally.

Not far away, Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi’s expressions were complicated. The Divine Phoenix Mountain and Heavenly Dao Sect were also alarmed by the news of the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, and this piece of news caused a huge uproar within the sects when it got back. So even if the two had a personal friendship with Lin Yun, they couldn’t go against the orders of their sects. No matter what, they couldn’t allow Lin Yun to leave just like that with the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.

“Lin Xiao is in huge trouble this time. I didn’t expect the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown to have such a huge origin.” Xiao Yuanqi said in a helpless tone.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Ji Lingfeng squeezed out a smile, and said, “That fellow’s fortune is too heaven-defying, but we don’t have to be worried. As long as he hands over the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, the holy lands won’t do anything to him. At the very least, his life is safe.”

“Are we going to snatch it from him, then?” Xiao Yuanqi smiled wryly.

“Very unlikely, and it’s useless for the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown to be in his hands. The holy lands need face, so they will try to exchange it from him with treasures.” Ji Lingfeng smiled.

“But it’s hard to say for the Ming Cult…” Xiao Yuanqi whispered.

“If Lin Yun is really from the Azure Dragon’s lineage, it’s fine even though he killed Yu Wenxiu. Yu Wenxiu could only blame himself for his stubbornness. If we were in Lin Xiao’s position, we wouldn't hesitate to kill Yu Wenxiu. I want to see if they have the cheek to flip the table. If they don’t want their face, I don’t mind standing out.” Ji Lingfeng sneered.

Xiao Yuanqi had received some news that Lin Xiao seemed to have a pretty good relationship with the Divine Phoenix Mountain, and he even had some transactions with them. Ji Lingfeng might not be a saint disciple, but his surname was Ji. This was where he got his confidence to challenge the Ming Cult.

“Haha. Everyone is waiting here? What a coincidence because I’m also waiting!” An eerie voice resounded right at that moment. When all the holy lands’ disciples and demonic cultivators turned around, they saw the Fire God General’s party arriving.

This made Ji Lingfeng furrow his brows with a hint of ferocity flashing across his pupils. “These demonic dogs still dare to show themselves?”

“There’s another person in their party.” Xiao Yuanqi said.

Aside from the three God Generals, there was a black-robed man beside them. This person had covered his head with a hood, looking eerie and sinister.

Xiao Yuanqi suddenly thought of something, and asked, “If I remember correctly, they left the Black Tortoise Vault the quickest, right?”

Hearing that, Ji Lingfeng nodded his head. But his face suddenly changed, and he had an ill premonition.
