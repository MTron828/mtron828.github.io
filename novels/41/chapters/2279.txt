Chapter 2280 - You're Still Lacking

A clear word echoed throughout the Flame Dragon Valley before three thousand ribbons streaked across the sky in the next moment, looking like long spears as they pierced the demonic corpses. Some were pierced with one ribbon, while some were pierced with multiple ribbons.

After the ribbons pierced the bodies of those demonic corpses, they aimed for the others until all of them were pierced and none of them moved. The flesh of the demonic corpses soon began to dissolve, leaving behind the skeletal frames that were still struggling. But they were completely suppressed.

When the thunderclouds and violent gale disappeared, Lin Yun landed on the Flame Dragon’s skull with one knee on the ground, gasping for breath. It was exhausting to manifest his sword intent into three thousand ribbons since it had used up all of his saint aura and mental energy.

But when he landed, his saint aura was replenished and filled up his violet palace before flowing through his limbs as the sacred flame, saint origin, and constellations showed signs of combining.

Lin Yun was surprised because he was about to reach the Saint Realm. He didn’t expect to show signs of making a breakthrough here. If he left now, he might be able to make a breakthrough on the spot while being in seclusion. That wasn’t all, his sword sea began to rumble with golden rays appearing.

“The Divine Light Sword Intent prioritises cultivating the righteous aura. Junior Brother, this is the profundity of the Divine Light Sword Intent, so comprehend well…”

Ye Guhan’s voice appeared in Lin Yun’s mind as his Divine Light Sword Intent reached lesser mastery.

“Holy shit. He stole all the limelight.” Li Feibai was shocked and amazed. But when she raised her head, she instantly noticed that Lin Yun wasn’t in a good situation because of his great exhaustion. She immediately soared to the sky and came over to Lin Yun. She asked with concern on her face, “Are you alright?”

“I’m fine. I just over-exhausted myself a little,” Lin Yun smiled. That was true because even though his foundation wasn’t affected, he had over-exhausted himself. He continued, “I need some time, so protect me.”

“Okay.” Li Feibai agreed without any hesitation.

Lin Yun trusted Li Feibai and gently tapped his foot on the ground, arriving at the Flame Dragon’s skull. When he sat down, the two sword canons circulated as he began to devour the spiritual energy in the surroundings to replenish his exhaustion.

Far away, the Ying River King and Zhao Tianyu joined up. While they both looked ragged, they didn’t suffer any fatal injuries; however, Zhao Tianyu’s injuries were slightly more serious. He held onto a fan with his hand, and his face had become pale.

The Ying River King had more or less recovered, so he looked at the surrounding demonic corpses with a darkened face, “If we can’t get rid of Lin Yun now, he will become a huge threat in the future.”

Zhao Tianyu patted his fan with his other hand, and replied, “Let’s be more realistic. He has already become a huge threat. Did you expect what he just did?”

They could tell Lin Yun was smart and knew he couldn't resolve so many demonic corpses in such a short time. And yet, Lin Yun dispersed his sword intent to pierce the demonic corpses with three thousand ribbons, sealing them and achieving a similar effect.

The demonic corpses weren’t weak, but they had their advantages since they were dead and could tie down all the Saints in the Flame Dragon Valley. They could capture everyone if they had more time, but everything went down the drain now. The Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan no longer had sufficient manpower to deal with them.

“It’s not too late for us to move now.” The Ying River King squinted, “He has exhausted all of his saint aura and sword intent. This is the perfect opportunity for us to deal with him. If we can capture him alive, I can refine him into a demonic corpse and a Sword Saint. You rest while I deal with him. Tell your divine maiden not to be in a hurry to make a move.”

The Ying River King’s eyes flashed with murderous intent. He didn’t activate his bloodline earlier because he didn’t think that he was defeated by Lin Yun before. But this was a good opportunity, and he didn’t want to miss it. With a roar, the Ying River King gathered ten-odd demonic corpses and charged into the Flame Dragon Valley, “Charge with me!”

While Lin Yun was suppressing all the demonic corpses within the Flame Dragon Valley, the other Saints came to their senses when they saw the Ying River King charging over. These people who wanted to leave the Flame Dragon Valley earlier immediately changed their minds.

“Protect Flower Burial!”

“These people want to go after Flower Burial!” They noticed the Ying River King’s intention and soared to the sky to stop the Demonspirit Clan.

“A bunch of flies dare to stand in my way?” The Ying River King roared as he faced four third-stage Saint Lords without drawing his weapon. He was powerful and easily restrained those four Saint Lords with his Great Yin Domain.

With a wave of his hand, he pierced through the chest of a Saint Lord and tore apart the other party’s constellation. This shocked the other three Saint Lords as they retreated and executed their low-grade dragon spirit martial techniques with saint artifacts.

Dragon spirit martial techniques were highly lethal, even if they were only low grades, especially in the hands of third-stage Saint Lords.

But the Ying River King was a fourth-stage Saint Lord, and he naturally didn’t place the three Saint Lords in his eyes. With a wave of his hand, his saint energy began to distort the surrounding space. The three Saint Lords were caught in the distortion and took a palm from the Ying River King from a distance away, sending them flying away.

“Garbage!” The Ying River King said with disdain as his gaze fell onto the Flame Dragon’s skull. When he continued forth, several fourth-stage Saint Lords bore the pressure and joined hands to stop him. But it was futile. Those fourth-stage saint Lords were easily defeated in less than ten-odd moves, sent flying away.

Everyone came to their senses, knowing that the Ying River King was strong despite being so easily suppressed by Lin Yun. But cultivators of the Eastern Desolation weren’t cowards, especially after seeing how Lin Yun sealed all the demonic corpses earlier.

After they came to their senses, ten-odd people charged over once more. They would have all died here if it weren’t for Lin Yun. But that didn’t mean they were safe now because they had to protect Lin Yun.

“You guys are getting on my nerves!” The Ying River King lost his patience and the vertical eye on his forehead opened up, unleashing a golden beam as he activated his Golden-Eyed Demonspirit’s bloodline. The ten-odd Saint Lords were easily suppressed by the demonic aura that he gave off before they could even get close.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“It’s a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit!”

“It’s a Demonspirit King!”

“It’s really a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit…” Everyone was shocked. They knew how terrifying a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit could be. No one believed it earlier, but they were afraid now that they witnessed it with their eyes.

“Who dares to stop me?!” The Ying River King roared, intimidating all the cultivators in the surrounding area. With a wave of his hand, a demonic aura swept out along with a terrifying chill that opened a path before him, “What a bunch of rats! Do you think that I don’t have any temper?

“Hmph!” With no one stopping him now, he snorted and landed on the Flame Dragon’s skull. Looking at Lin Yun, who was recovering, murderous intent began to blaze within the Ying River King’s eyes.

“Ying River King, your opponent is me!” Li Feibai quietly appeared with a lotus blooming beneath her feet as a Sovereign Constellation appeared. When the constellation opened, a golden ocean with a blooming lotus was revealed.

Under the aura of a Sovereign Constellation, even the Ying River King’s aura, after releasing his bloodline, couldn’t tear Li Feibai’s aura apart.

The Ying River King’s white robe fluttered, and he smiled, “You think you can stop me?”

“What about me as well?” Ji Zixi stood out with the Divine Phoenix Mirror hovering above her head.

The Ying River King frowned with fury flashing in his eyes. He wasn’t afraid of the two women, but this was the perfect opportunity to kill Lin Yun while he was still recovering. If he missed this opportunity, it would be difficult for him to kill Lin Yun again.

“How ignorant! Since you two dare to stand in my way, the two of you can die!” The Ying River King said as he walked forth. He wasn’t afraid of the Sovereign Constellation nor the Divine Phoenix Mountain, and his confidence struck fear in everyone’s hearts.

As Ji Zixi began forming seals with her hands, the Divine Phoenix Mirror shone brightly, manifesting a sea of flames that instantly dyed the sky red. In the next second, a golden beam shot out from the Divine Phoenix Mirror that contained the sacred flames that had the powerful pressure of the phoenixes.

The Ying River King casually dodged the golden beam that struck the Flame Dragon’s skull. A thick layer of dust was torn apart, revealing that the dragon’s bone was emitting a golden radiance. The power of a Sovereign Saint Artifact failed to inflict any damage on the Ying River King and had easily endured the aura with the golden eye on his forehead.

Ji Zixi was surprised but formed a seal. A dazzling phoenix then flew from the sea of flames.

The Ying River King waved his hand and the Heavenly Moon Blade appeared. He cut his right palm with the blade and the blood was absorbed by the Heavenly Moon Blade, adding a demonic trait to this Fourspirit Glory Saint Artifact. A complete and realistic world appeared from the blade as a powerful blade intent swept out from the Ying River King. Astral Blade Intent.

When the blade intent and Great Yin Domain began to fuse, the Ying River King swung his blade. The Ying River King was now empowered by his bloodline and the phoenix was easily severed into two before it could even cry.

“You’re still too tender. It’s a waste for you to carry a Sovereign Saint Artifact,” the Ying River King sneered as his smile became sinister. When he finished speaking, he dashed forth with his blade ray flashing, forcing Ji Zixi to retreat as the sea of flames within the Divine Phoenix Mirror became dim.

Seeing that Ji Zixi was in danger, Li Feibai quickly made a move and unleashed hundreds of Flame Dragons at the Ying River King. Her Sovereign Constellation empowered her attacks, in which the Ying River King raised the blade to protect his head as he retreated and shuttled around.

The blade ray would slice apart a flame dragon whenever he spun his sword. When the Ying River King landed on the ground, a demonic beam shot out from his vertical eye that shattered all the Flame Dragons. He stood on the Flame Dragon’s head with just a blade, looking domineering.

“Flower Burial will die today no matter what!” The Ying River King pridefully said as he raised the Heavenly Moon Blade and swung it down at the two women. He wanted to hack Li Feibai’s Sovereign Constellation apart and inflict heavy injuries on Ji Zixi.

Everyone was intimidated by his blade. Ji Zixi and Li Feibai had never experienced this before; they also never expected that a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit would be so terrifying.

“Allow me!” Lin Yun opened his eyes right then and charged forth without hesitation. He reached for his heart and slowly drew out the Flower Burial Sword. When he grabbed onto the sword, he pulled it out and unleashed a dazzling sword ray with the four glory spirits activated.

When a heavenly dragon, divine phoenix, and the three swords bloomed around Lin Yun, his sword sent the Ying River King flying back.

The Ying River King took three steps back, reaching the edge of the Flame Dragon’s skull, and nearly fell off. But after stabilizing himself, the Ying River King said, “You came at a good time!”

When Lin Yun descended from the sky, he held onto the Flower Burial Sword with one hand while the other hand was behind him, fusing his Sword Dao with the two sword canons, executing the Divine Firefly Sword with sword rays being unleashed.

Each sword was deep and unfathomable as Lin Yun’s sword technique reached a perfect state. No one could see anything wrong with it because Lin Yun’s Divine Firefly Sword was flawless. No matter how powerful the Ying River King was, Lin Yun faced him head-on with a sword, easily dealing with the Ying River King like a Sword Immortal.

After ten-odd moves, Lin Yun’s attack changed and he went on the offensive. Even when the Ying River King tried to block his attack with full force, he was sent flying away, his arm becoming numb.

The Ying River King looked at Lin Yun with disbelief because he should’ve exhausted all his saint aura and sword intent.

With a gentle spin of the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun said, “I said that you’re still lacking even if you've brought out your full strength.”
