Chapter 552 - Unreasonable

The atmosphere in the room suddenly became gloomy as not even Tang Yu could remain calm when mentioning something so humiliating.

“You should be able to guess what I need of you, right?” Tang Yu sighed. There were two requirements for the disciples participating in the competition. First, they had to be under the age of twenty. Second, they had to be a third grade spiritualist. Luckily, Lin Yun fits the bill.

“You’re saying…?” probed Lin Yun.

Tang Yu looked at Lin Yun and said, “I wish for you to take part in the competition this time. We can’t afford another loss.”

Lin Yun instantly understood why Mo Ling would teach him spiritual runes personally. After all, he couldn’t participate if he wasn’t a third grade spiritualist. But the risk was too great as he would offend the other four academies if the Heavenly Province Academy won.

After all, every spiritualist had a vast network and he would eventually leave the Heavenly Province Academy. Lin Yun fell into deep thought before he asked, “You trust me that much? I might have some talent in spiritual runes, but I’ve just formed the soul mark. This matter concerns the life and death of the academy. The other elders have no opinion about entrusting it to me?”

Lin Yun still hadn't decided if he wanted to help, but he knew he couldn’t refuse directly since he had received a favor from the academy. He could only try and probe Tang Yu’s position.

“The dean did have some doubts about you, but Elder Yu and I are optimistic about you. After all, not many people can become a third grade spiritualist at the age of twenty, nor can they have such a powerful cultivation like you. Furthermore, the academy doesn’t have many options…” Tang Yu smiled, “If we had a choice we also wouldn’t have gone as far as guiding you to become a third grade spiritualist.”

Lin Yun didn’t give a reply immediately as he hesitated. If he had agreed to it, then he would do everything to make sure he completes it. This was the type of person he was.

“I know what you’re concerned about. You’re not a part of the academy, so you’ll be taking a risk to help us. But the academy won’t let you take the risk for nothing.” Tang Yu smiled. “As long as you can help us keep the incomplete divine rune, I can let you comprehend it for half a day. Aside from that, as long as you agree, we’ll give you a lesser divine ability after it's done.”

A lesser divine ability! Lin Yun’s heart jolted as the temptation of a divine ability was great. As for the incomplete divine rune, he was also curious about it. He believed that it would aid him greatly in comprehending the rose painting. He owed the academy a favor, so if he accepted these conditions, he would come off a little too materialistic.

“I won’t refuse if the academy needs my help. But there’s no need for any other benefits. I owed the academy a favor, to begin with. I wouldn’t have been able to become a third grade spiritualist without Senior Sister Mo. Without Liu Yunyan and Bai Yi, I would also be a dead man,” said Lin Yun. This meant that they wouldn’t owe each other anything after that.

Tang Yu was briefly stunned before he smiled, “You’re wrong. You’re here in the academy to study the path of spiritual runes, right? Even without Mo Ling, you would still become a third grade spiritualist in the matter of time. It’s decided then. We won’t owe each other anything.”

Lin Yun ultimately nodded his head, but he soon thought of Liu Yunyan’s recent behavior. She shouldn’t be related to this matter, right? Lin Yun pondered the situation for a quick moment before he decided to ask.

But when Tang Yu heard it, his face changed and sighed, “That lass’ father was one of the disciples who fought two decades ago. Her father was also the strongest among the three and was the hope of the academy. At that time, the academy had lost two rounds in a row, so her father had no choice but to choose Hell Mode.”

Lin Yun’s face changed because he wasn’t unfamiliar with the term ‘Hell Mode.’ After all, he had climbed out of Hell Mode back in the Dragon Gate Competition. Although he wasn’t sure about this Hell Mode, it was probably the same as the one he completed. Without a doubt, Liu Yunyan’s father had lost.

“The academy paid a huge price because of that and the academy even suffered humiliation. No one talked about it, but everyone blamed it on her father. Because of that, her father died after a few years.”

From Tang Yu’s explanation, Lin Yun finally understood what kind of pressure the academy had to go through. Lifting the teacup to his lips, Lin Yun’s eyes changed as he asked, “She’s also one of the three this time, right?”

“The academy doesn’t have many third grade spiritualists, not to mention one that's under the age of twenty. So, yes, Liu Yunyan is one of them.” Tang Yu nodded.

“Then who’s the last person?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“Me.” An indifferent voice sounded out as a lady came down from the pavilion. She had defined features, but her face was too cold. Her coldness was emphasized by her arrogant temperament. Even Mo Ling looked more amicable than her.

Her arrogance wasn’t directed at Lin Yun, but it was due to her living environment. This made Lin Yun wonder because he could tell that she didn’t belong to the academy. Her aura was powerful, which surprised Lin Yun because her cultivation was in the pinnacle Yin stage.

The academy didn’t lack disciples in the pinnacle Yin stage, but there weren’t any of them under the age of twenty. So where did this lady come from?

Tang Yu stood up and introduced her, “Lin Yun, let me introduce you. She’s the dean’s granddaughter. She went to the Heavenly Sword Sect to cultivate at a young age and rarely comes back. She even has a high chance of becoming a core disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect within two years.”

The Heavenly Sword Sect was one of the nine overlord forces, so Lin Yun wasn’t surprised that she was so arrogant. When he thought about it, the Heavenly Sword Sect had a deep connection with the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Back then, they both belonged to the Sword Sect. The Heavenly Sword Sect and Sword Firmament Pavilion were both built on the inheritance of the sword sect. The Sword Firmament Pavilion took the inheritance of the Overlord Sword.

“What’s the matter, you have a grudge with the Heavenly Sword Sect?” The lady directed her sharp gaze over when she noticed Lin Yun’s unusual gaze. Her gaze contained the initial xiantian sword intent, but it was much too weak to compare with Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent that was already in the greater mastery.

“Nope,” smiled Lin Yun.

“That’s for the best.” Mu Xue snorted and she glared at Lin Yun, “I’ve heard a lot about you when I returned to the academy yesterday. A swordsman from the Great Qin Empire… you’re rather arrogant. Not only did you injure a disciple here, but you even humiliated a few core disciples. Am I right?”

No wonder Mu Xue had enmity with him. So it turns out that she had looked into him. Lin Yun wasn’t surprised since he knew that many people were unhappy with him, especially from the Profound Yin Lake’s competition. Not only did he beat three core disciples, but he even seized the flower king.

So if she went to ask around about him, his reputation would definitely not be good. As for her enmity, it was easier to explain since she was also a member of the academy despite being a disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect. Naturally, she was unhappy that someone came to mess around in her home. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Whatever you say,” replied Lin Yun casually.

His casual reply made the chill in Mu Xue’s eyes grow even colder as she said, “Don’t think that no one here can restrain you. You better behave yourself in front of me!”

Lin Yun sneered inwardly. He really couldn’t be bothered with her.

“Mu Xue, you’re still the same,” smiled Tang Yu as he came out to ease the atmosphere. “If it goes without any accident, Lin Yun will be your companion in the competition.”

“Companion? I’ve yet to agree to it,” said Mu Xue as she glanced at Lin Yun.

“But he’s someone recommended by Mo Ling. You should have trust in Mo Ling, right?” Tang Yu smiled bitterly at this scene.

“That’s impossible. Big Sister Mo must have been deceived by him,” said Mu Xue as she looked at Lin Yun with disbelief in his eyes.

Right at this moment, a series of explosions sounded out as Yu Mu rushed in, “This is bad. The White Jade Academy is here.”
