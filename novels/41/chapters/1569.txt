Chapter 1570 - White Dragon Saint Sword

They were all shocked that Divine Dragon Artifacts had appeared. Each colorful artifact flying around the sky contained a massive dragon aura, and they could faintly see saint runes flickering on them. When the artifacts broke out from the pool's surface, they soared to the sky, wanting to escape.

“Saint Lord, are we still not going to make a move?” Everyone nervously turned to look at the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord.

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord recollected his gaze from the Dragon Transforming Pool. He could sense an extremely powerful aura at the bottom of the pool. But that aura was too deep within the pool, at least two thousand meters deep. But at that depth, even those at the pinnacle Dragon Pulse Realm wouldn’t be able to stay long, and he couldn’t detect that depth by relying on his eyes and senses alone.

Just when the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord wanted to use some means to take a look at Lin Yun, the Divine Dragon Artifacts flew out from the pool. When the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord raised his head to look at those artifacts, his facial expression became weird, but his movements weren’t slow. He casually formed a seal, creating multiple arrays that linked together in the form of a light screen.

When those Divine Dragon Artifacts collided with the screen, they were rebounded and could only fly within this enclosed space. In the end, the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord moved and activated all the arrays on the Heavenly Pool Manor to suppress those artifacts.

“Senior Sister Mu, what’s a Divine Dragon Artifact?” Ji Shuxuan asked. He had never heard of them before, and this was the first time he saw them.

With shock, Mu Xueqin replied, “This is also my first time seeing them. The bottom of the Dragon Transforming Pool is connected to a Divine Dragon Realm. So artifacts will occasionally fly out, and they are saint artifacts that were forged by an ancient dragon clan. Every one of them is a treasure comparable to those on the same level; some are long-lost artifacts. But this is my first time seeing so many Divine Dragon Artifacts.”

Luo Yuan’s eyes also flickered with greed because at least three of those artifacts contained a divine rune. He would've immediately snatched them if the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord wasn’t around. After all, he was the strongest existence beneath the Golden Generation, and he didn’t think anyone there could be his opponent.

Suppressing his excitement, Luo Yuan turned to look at the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord, “Saint Lord, according to the rules, we can also compete for these treasures, right?”

There was such a rule because there wasn’t any pattern for the artifacts to appear. The previous appearance of Divine Dragon Artifacts was decades ago, and everyone had long forgotten about the rule. But with Luo Yuan’s reminder, the leaders of the other sects wore grave expressions.

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord swept a gaze over the artifacts and saw that at least three of them could be considered powerful treasures. Even he was tempted to take them for himself. After all, he could give them to his descendants, even if he didn’t need them. The three treasures were a war flag, spear, and sword. So he naturally wanted all of them, if possible.

But it was a pity that he could only think about it because he couldn’t afford to offend the eight powerful sects. Recollecting his thoughts, the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord replied, “Let’s go with the old rules. But there are more treasures this time than in the past, so I’ll take one. As for the remaining treasures, you guys can compete amongst yourselves.”

“Hahaha! We won’t even be able to obtain one without the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord. So the Saint Lord can go ahead.” Luo Yuan smiled. There were three high-grade Divine Dragon Artifacts, and he didn’t mind letting the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord have one.

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord reached out and took a treasure like he was retrieving a star from the sky. Shortly after, a pendant appeared in his hand, and Luo Yuan squinted his eyes when he saw the pendant. He was surprised that the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was so cautious.

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord didn’t choose to relying on his identity to touch the three powerful treasures. Right then, an incident occurred and an artifact swiftly flew towards the sky. It was a white saint sword.

The sword was kept in its sheath, and the sheath was smooth like a jade, leaving behind snowflakes in its path. This surprised the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord as he stowed the pendant before forming a seal with his hands, activating the saint runes on the light barrier.

When the light barrier pressed down and collided with the sword, sparks flew around that merged with the snowflakes around the sword.

“What saint artifact is that?” Luo Yuan was shocked. “You two go after those three treasures. I’ll go after this sword!”

The two people beside him immediately soared into the sky, heading toward the three powerful treasures.

“You guys go, too.” Mu Xueqin said to Zhou Yuan and Wang Yun before soaring to the sky, heading toward that saint sword. The other leaders from the other sects also didn’t hesitate to charge forth because they could tell that the saint sword wasn’t ordinary.

“Ha!” Luo Yuan wore a mocking smile when seeing those people behind him. When he turned back to look at the saint sword, his speed exploded and immediately arrived before that white saint sword.

When the saint sword felt threatened, it manifested into a hundred-foot long white dragon and collided with Luo Yuan. This changed Luo Yuan’s face and he pushed his palm forth before retreating, not daring to probe the sword.

“What the hell is going on?” Mu Xueqin and others who were behind Luo Yuan were surprised when they saw this scene. They didn’t dare to clash with that white dragon head-on. They executed various holy spirit martial techniques against the white dragon, but the white dragon manifested by that white sword quickly shattered their attacks, making their faces change.

“Interesting.” Luo Yuan’s interest was piqued with flames blazing in his pupils. As a moon rose behind him when he executed the Lesser Heavenly Moon, he didn’t choose to duck this time and clashed with the white dragon head-on. When the moon released a powerful light, the white dragon was sent flying by Luo Yuan’s palm, and everyone else no longer dared to hold back and executed their ghost spirit martial techniques when they saw this scene.

“Get lost!” Luo Yuan sneered and roared at the leader from the Thunder Sect.

“You’re courting death!” Yan Gu, the Thunder Sect’s leader, was also a ruthless character, and he naturally could tell that this saint sword wasn’t ordinary. He had no intention of giving it away. Yan Gu swept out with a chop as the purple moon rose behind him, and the silhouette in the purple moon executed a similar gesture. The two attacks combined formed a gigantic, descending indigo-blazing blade.

“Profound Sky Heavy Armor!” Luo Yuan roared. Saint runes manifested into a black armor on the surface of his body. When Yan Gu’s blade landed on the armor, it created several cracks on the armor. But Luo Yuan didn’t take a step back. The armor was also being slowly repaired.

“You like to play with flames?” Luo Yuan smiled and waved his hand, summoning a sea of golden flames behind him.

The sea of flames made Yan Gu’s face change because he could sense a fatal threat. He wanted to avoid them, but it was too late. A demonic claw had reached out from the sea of flames, swiftly catching up with Yan Gu and tearing apart his phenomenon.

When the indigo moon exploded, Yan Gu threw a mouthful of blood. Luo Yuan then pushed his palm forth. The palm made Yan Gu’s chest cave in, and Yan Gu slammed against the barrier created by the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord.

“You trash!” Luo Yuan mockingly smiled and chased after Yan Gu. This made Mu Xueqin and the others who were chasing after the white dragon turn back. When they saw Luo Yuan, their eyes flashed with fear. Just Luo Yuan’s fifth-grade flame intent was enough to deal with them, not to mention that Luo Yuan clearly still had trump cards.

At the very least, Mu Xueqin knew Luo Yuan had a whip. Paired with his Profound Sky Canon, it could allow him to unleash a terrifying power. Simultaneously, the sky of the Heavenly Pool Manor had already fallen into chaos.

At least two people were competing for each artifact. As for the three high-grade artifacts, the battle for them was chaotic, and ten-odd people were fighting.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Father, what’s the origin of that sword?” Pei Qian, the young lord of the Heavenly Pool Manor, asked while looking at the white dragon in the sky.

“It should be a saint artifact that the Mo Clan forged for the White Dragon Palace, and it might be a Glory Saint Artifact…” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord replied in an uncertain tone.

Upon hearing that it might be a Glory Saint Artifact, Pei Qian’s eyes blazed with flames because his primary weapon was also a sword.

“Don’t even think about competing for it.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord handed the pendant over. He continued, “This pendant can be activated three times. It can protect you from the attacks of a pinnacle Samsara Edict Realm powerhouse. It is so much so that it can protect your life against saints. So keep it safe.”

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord might have ideas to obtain it if it was only a saint sword forged by the Mo Clan. But if it was a Glory Saint Sword, it wasn’t something he could protect, even if he obtained it.

Pei Qian had no joy on his face when holding onto the pendant. He then looked at the battle between Luo Yuan and others. After all, a Glory Saint Artifact forged by the Mo Clan was too tempting.

“Father, I’m also a Dragon Pulse Realm genius. Can’t I fight for it relying on my own strength?” Pei Qian asked, still holding some hope for that white sword.

Since the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was thinking about something else, he casually replied, “Don’t even think about it. No one is Luo Yuan’s opponent, and you’ll only be courting death.”

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was wondering if he had forgotten about something. He felt he missed something important because of the Divine Dragon Artifacts’ appearance.

Three thousand meters deep in the pool, Lin Yun opened his eyes and released an aura belonging to the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“How much of your astral energy ocean is converted into dragon origin?” Lil’ Purple asked.

Lin Yun briefly examined himself and replied, “About 80% of my astral energy has been converted to dragon origin.”

His words made Lil’ Purple silent for a long time before she replied, “You’re a monster.”

It was insane for someone to convert 80% of their astral energy into dragon origin upon reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm. Many people couldn’t even convert it all in the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.
