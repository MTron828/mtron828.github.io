Chapter 1313 - It's Back

On the summit of the mountain, the cocoon was glowing brightly, and the Blood Flame Divine Rune was dazzling. At the same time, a heartbeat could be heard from the cocoon, and he could sense that a boundless vitality was being nurtured.

“The Dragon Saint Pellet is really strong…” Lin Yun muttered to himself on the summit of the mountain. He had obtained an inheritance from the Azure Dragon Lord on the Heavenly Path, and the Azure Dragon Saint Art was only a secondary benefit that came with it. But the true inheritance lay in the Azure Dragon True Bone.

That was the true bone of the Azure Dragon King, which had an origin divine rune imprinted on it, and it was enveloped in the profundity of thunderstorms. The existence of the Azure Dragon Saint Art was meant to nourish the Azure Dragon True Bone, constantly excavating the power of the true bone. If he could grasp the origin divine rune, the azure dragon true blood in the true bone would nourish his entire body, transforming his body in the process.

When the Azure Dragon Saint Art reaches a high level, he could use the Azure Dragon Divine Rune as the core and combine it with the blood to transform into an Azure Dragon. But after losing the Azure Dragon True Bone, the Azure Dragon Saint Art was half-crippled, and it was reduced to a mere body-refining martial technique.

Although it was still powerful, it still couldn’t be compared to the inheritance left behind by the Azure Dragon Lord. But now, the Azure Dragon Saint Art had undergone a new birth under Lil’ Purple’s constant help, allowing him to possess the Innate Azure Dragon Saint Physique. When the cocoon breaks, it would possess a dragon spirit and dragon pearl, thus reaching a whole new realm.

Recollecting his thoughts, Lin Yun began to practice the Divine Solar Lunar Fist on the summit of the mountain. The Divine Solar Lunar Fist had a total of three forms, the Heaven and Earth Unite, Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron, and Eternal Light.

The Divine Solar Lunar Fist was one of the strongest holy spirit martial techniques, comparable to the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. Especially the last form, Eternal Light. It was capable of surpassing the scope of holy spirit martial techniques. Lin Yun had already reached the second form, but due to the limitation of his previous cultivation, he couldn’t bring it to the manifestation stage.

He had barely reached complete mastery in it, and the power still wasn’t up to his satisfaction. Since he couldn’t make this move entirely his, it became the reason why he rarely used it in fights. But now that he has reached the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm, he no longer has any limitations.

As the golden crow and silver phoenix holy spirits flew from Lin Yun’s body, they began to revolve above him with starlight shining onto him. As they revolved over him, the golden crow and silver phoenix looked like the sun and moon revolving around one another, causing the surrounding space to distort with boundless power strengthening him.

At this moment, Lin Yun was empowered by the heavens and earth, making him feel like an immovable mountain, and looking like an ancient divine dragon.

“The Divine Solar Lunar Fist…” Lin Yun suddenly comprehended the true profundity of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist.

The golden crow represented the sun while the silver phoenix represented the moon. The second form was to turn himself into a dragon, strengthened by the power of the heavens and earth to manifest into a cauldron. It might sound complicated, but it was the continuation of the first form of using the two holy spirits to manifest the heavens and earth.

“Transform!” Lin Yun’s body began to transform and fused with the power of the heavens and earth. At this moment, he was like a cauldron that had been existing for all eternity. After the two holy spirits manifested into the sun and moon, they gathered towards him. Lin Yun quickly activated the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, which was also called the Seven Flowers Convergence. In the next second, forty-nine Demonic Astral Flowers brightly lit up like stars.

When he gently took a step out, an immense power filled his body. The power had reached a level that even gave his Innate Azure Dragon Saint Physique great difficulty bearing it. His eyes were flickering with stars, the sun, and the moon.

When the power within his body reached the limit, Lin Yun finally threw his punch out. His punch had manifested into a cauldron, causing the surrounding space to violently tremble with the sun and moon shining brightly. Each ray of light contained a destructive prowess and reached a terrifying height. At this moment, he had finally brought the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron to the manifestation stage.

“This form is really terrifying. Can it be that the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron really does exist in this world?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. He had seen the Divine Dragon Pagoda back in the Profound Azure Prefecture. It was so tall that it reached the clouds, and it was meant to suppress the Divine Dragon Empire’s fortune.

In the end, his eyesight was still too low. The Kunlun Realm was massive, and the Divine Dragon Era was even bigger. Those transcendent geniuses from the Ancient Barren Domain were transcendents for a reason, and the Profound Azure Prefecture was just a mere countryside in their eyes.

After he was done practicing the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron, Lin Yun began to practice the Eternal Light. Eternal Light means using the two holy spirits to manifest the Greater Yin and Greater Yang energies, allowing the two energies to fuse into primitive chaos before unleashing an eternal ray of light. The intent behind this form was majestic, and he could lose himself within it if he wasn’t careful.

Lin Yun was calmly waiting when a draconic roar echoed two days later. At the same time, cracking sounds comparable to the shattering of the heavens resounded. This made Lin Yun open his eyes, flashing with a glimpse of light in that moment. The light gave the impression that it would last for eternity.

Ever since Lin Yun created his Sovereign Constellation, he realized that his path had been widened. There wasn’t any difficulty in cultivating such a powerful holy spirit martial technique, nor did he lose himself within it. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“The cocoon finally broke?” Lin Yun stood up with excitement flashing across his pupils. Compared to the Divine Solar Lunar Fist, he was more concerned about the cocoon, since this was a trump card that he could use even after reaching the Elysium Core Realm or even the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Suddenly, the cocoon broke and an azure dragon of nearly thirty feet soared from it. When the azure dragon appeared, lightning began to rumble and a powerful gale started to howl, making the surroundings look as though the apocalypse had come, while being accompanied by a majestic dragon aura.

The azure dragon was three times bigger than before, and the effects of the Dragon Saint Pellet had far exceeded Lin Yun’s expectations. Not only was the dragon aura enhanced, but Lin Yun could even see the spirituality in its pupils. This meant that the azure dragon now possessed a dragon spirit.

When he thought about that, the azure dragon broke away from the clouds with lightning and storms sweeping the surroundings, reaching a terrifying height. The dragon runes on its body were flickering with a faint crimson light. That was the Blood Flame Divine Rune enveloping its entire body.

When the azure dragon dived towards Lin Yun, countless purple-golden dragon runes returned to his body, and the Blood Flame Divine Rune also returned to the Azure Dragon Mark. When he circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art, surges of boundless energy began to rush throughout his body.

All the accumulated energy within his body exploded. His entire body was undergoing a transformation at this moment. The azure dragon was fusing with his body, and the power from the Dragon Saint Pellet was nourishing him.

But this process was accompanied by great pain, making Lin Yun grit his teeth with his face distorted. This process lasted for a long time, and when the intense pain reached a limit, Lin Yun let out a ferocious roar from his mouth.

At the same time, light shone from his pupils, taking on the look of dragon pupils, and he was also enveloped in a purple-golden light. When the terrifying aura spread out, it was as if an ancient beast had come to life.

When Lin Yun let out a breath, it felt great because his entire body had completed its transformation and reached its peak once more. Furthermore, the purple-golden dragon runes on his body had reached an astronomical number of three thousand, bringing his Azure Dragon Saint Art to a whole new level.

“Azure Dragon Grasp!” Lin Yun reached out and three thousand dragon runes poured into his hand, manifesting into a majestic dragon claw. In the path of the dragon claw, everything within his sight was being reduced to dust, and it looked as though everything within a thousand miles was within his grasp.

When Lin Yun clenched his fist, a vortex appeared on the dragon claw and instantly pulled ten-odd hills into his palm. As he opened up his fist and gently patted it, a majestic dragon claw landed on the ground, leaving behind a huge dragon claw mark with countless cracks spreading out. Looking from afar, it looked like an ancient true dragon had landed on the ground from the sky.

“It’s back…” Lin Yun muttered with excitement in his pupils. With the dragon runes back, he wouldn’t be so easily injured if he faced the demonic trait of the Serene Night once more, not to mention that the strength of his Azure Dragon Saint Art had been tripled.

Now that he thought about it again, he had to thank that white-haired youth. This made Lin Yun wonder if that youth would show up once the greater saint origin appears.

Spreading his arms apart, Lin Yun soared into the sky. When he landed, he appeared beside Lil’ Purple. He saw that the gigantic flower that enveloped the Flower Burial Sword had withered, so he grabbed onto the sword. He could feel the deep connection he had with the sword, not to mention that the sword was circulating with an even stronger power. Just by grasping the hilt of the sword, he became enveloped in a sacred might.

Ultimately, he didn’t pull the sword out of the scabbard. There was no need for him to test it because he knew that it had been upgraded to a saint artifact.

“This sword is really incredible. With the Netherdream Saint Rune, it can pull others into an illusion. Not to mention that it even devoured the Serene Night Flame. This sword isn’t far from the Lightning Shadow Sword now…” Lil’ Purple said softly.

“There’s no need to hurry.” Lin Yun smiled. The Lightning Shadow Sword was forged by the Mo Clan, and it was once a genuine divine artifact. But the Flower Burial Sword could be upgraded, and Lin Yun believed that it would soon reach the height of the Lightning Shadow Sword in the future. Compared to the Lightning Shadow Sword, Lin Yun was more fond of the Flower Burial Sword.

Right at this moment, a bestial roar resounded from afar with a ferocious aura spreading out that even shook the heavens and earth. It was Lil’ Red, who had devoured the Devour Saint Rune. It had reached the Elysium Core Realm. It had become so powerful now that it even made Lin Yun’s eyes linger with fear.

“It’s back…” Lin Yun smiled.

“It’s back? What do you mean?” Lil’ Purple asked in confusion.

In response to her, Lin Yun merely replied with a smile. The Azure Dragon was back, the Flower Burial Sword was back, and even Lil’ Red was back.

“Call Lil’ Red over. It’s time for us to get going.”

“Alright!” Lil’ Purple said with her eyes lighting up. They had been holed up here for a long time, and she was already bored.
