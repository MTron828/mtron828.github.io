Chapter 2109: Fight

“Go and play with him,” Zhao Tianyu smiled. He appeared amicable and humble, but he had secretly transmitted his voice to the Whiteclothed Venerable to kill Ye Qingtian.

Everyone only felt a flash before their eyes, then the Whiteclothed Venerable appeared before Ye Qingtian. With a wave of his hand, a sword enveloped in demonic radiance appeared in his hand. He said, “This Heavenly Serpent Sword is a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact. Your sword is also a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, so I’m not bullying you.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Everyone’s faces changed upon hearing that. The Heavenly Serpent Sword was a formidable Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, and it was rumored that there was a Heavenly Aquatic Serpent’s demonic soul sealed within it. Furthermore, the Heavenly Aquatic Serpent could devour the blood and soul of others to strengthen itself, making it a notorious demonic sword.

When the Whiteclothed Venerable held onto the sword, it gave off a terrifying aura. When he swung his sword, hundreds of serpents flew out and coiled around him, which looked like a bizarre sword array.

As the Orangeclothed Venerable observed the battle, he asked, “Ye Qingtian’s sword intent is terrifying. Isn’t it inappropriate for Big Brother White to face him with a sword?”

“Everything is nothing before greater dao. With the empowerment of greater dao, Ye Qingtian won’t be able to unleash the advantage of his sword intent, and this battle is also a chance for Old White. If he can defeat Ye Qingtian, not only can he help us seize the Golden Lotus Flametree, but he can also seize Ye Qingtian’s fortune. At that time, there’s a high chance he can grasp the sword dao,” Zhao Tianyu smiled.

The sword dao was a sovereign dao, and one would transform if one could grasp it. The transformation it would bring was unimaginable.

As Lin Yun and the Whiteclothed Venerable faced off, their auras began to clash before they even moved. The sword auras they released caused the surrounding atmosphere to distort.

“Astral Sword Intent? What a surprise. I didn’t expect a little snake to grasp the Astral Sword Intent while at the Quasi-Saint Realm,” Lin Yun said. Before they even fought, Lin Yun could sense that the Whiteclothed Venerable had grasped the Astral Sword Intent. But the Whiteclothed Venerable didn’t reach greater mastery, so he still hadn’t condensed his sword star. Even so, the Whiteclothed Venerable must’ve been at the pinnacle of lesser mastery for a long time.

The Whiteclothed Venerable smiled, “It’s nothing compared to you. A genius swordsman like you really shouldn’t appear in the world.”

The Whiteclothed Venerable was smiling, but he was unhappy in his heart. With his talent in the sword, he could also be considered a genius swordsman without many opponents in the same generation. But he was nothing compared to Ye Qingtian. To be in the same generation as Ye Qingtian, he was destined to be outshone by Ye Qingtian, and this was the sorrow of every swordsman in this generation.

As the cave began to tremble, cracks appeared on the ground, and the Golden Lotus Flametree began to shake violently. This surprised many cultivators before they threw out blood and were sent flying away. They began to wonder what was happening and if the Whiteclothed Venerable had made a move.

Without warning, the Whiteclothed Venerable wrapped his sword in Astral Sword Intent and charged at Lin Yun. This was an ordinary attack, but its aura changed many people’s faces.

“How terrifying! An Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saint grasping the Astral Sword Intent was simply a monster!” The Astral Sword Intent was already heaven-defying enough in Ye Qingtian’s hands, but it was even more terrifying in the hands of the Whiteclothed Venerable.

Lin Yun stood in the same position before thrusting his sword towards the Whiteclothed Venerable’s heart. He adopted a risky fighting method. This was a competition on whose sword was faster and who had more confidence in their sword. They were competing in their strength and courage this time.

The Whiteclothed Venerable frowned because he was clearly in a disadvantageous position to fight Ye Qingtian with his life on the line even though his cultivation was at the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm. He retreated before unleashing a sword ray directly at Ye Qingtian’s forehead.

A snake-shaped sword aura coiled around the Whiteclothed Venerable before pouncing forth when he swung his sword. Lin Yun’s speed wasn’t slow either. He swung his sword, knocking the snake-shaped sword aura away.

The snake-shaped sword aura was sent flying away and plunged into the ground, emitting a terrifying aura. Lin Yun and the Whiteclothed Venerable were still fighting with swords targeted at each other’s fatal spots. They were too fast, leaving behind afterimages from their extreme speed, and everyone could only see sword rays flying around.

Everything happened too quickly. Despite being a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase, the Whiteclothed Venerable was stronger than the Bloodclothed and Scarletclothed Venerables despite not using his greater dao.

“Big Brother White seems to be in a disadvantageous position. He took several attacks, and even using the Heavenly Serpent Sword is futile,” the Orangeclothed Venerable said nervously, holding onto his chin. It was just as they had expected. Regarding sword dao, there was no way the Whiteclothed Venerable could compete with Ye Qingtian. This was because Ye Qingtian’s talent as a swordsman was too heaven-defying.

Zhao Tianyu was calm and composed as he said, “Old White won’t be convinced with just this. He’ll stop messing around after suffering a loss.”

.

Ten moves later, the Whiteclothed Venerable circulated his saint aura and unleashed his greater dao. He grasped the water dao and could further empower it with his bloodline, forming a boundless pressure. The Heavenly Aquatic Serpent’s bloodline and water dao instantly made Lin Yun feel great pressure.

Under the pressure, cracks began to appear on Lin Yun’s sword aura, and his nirvana aura became sluggish. He was in an unfavorable situation because the circulation of his nirvana aura was hindered, and he couldn’t even circulate his Astral Sword Intent that had reached complete mastery.

The Whiteclothed Venerable swung his sword, sending Lin Yun flying away. This time, the disadvantage in his sword technique was erased after bringing out his greater dao.

“Everything is nothing before greater dao. So what if you have a heaven-defying sword intent?” The Whiteclothed Venerable smiled, and his injuries began to recover.

“Is that so? I happen to share a different thought!” Lin Yun showed no weakness. Greater dao? So what?

“Ha!” The Whiteclothed Venerable laughed. While the Heavenly Serpent Sword was empowered by his greater dao, all the saint runes lit up, and the two glory spirits began to shine brightly. The Whiteclothed Venerable unleashed the full power of the sword and the power of the glory spirits formed into a darkness that could destroy the world.

It was hard for someone to fully unleash the power of a twospirit glory saint artifact while being at the Quasi-Saint Realm, but it was a different story if it was empowered by greater dao.

“Big Brother Ye is in trouble now.” Bai Qingyu became nervous, and she could sense the terrifying aura from so far away.

“Greater dao combined with a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, there’s no way it can be resolved.”

“Ye Qingtian might also have a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, but he’s not even at the Quasi-Saint Realm. If he could empower his sword with saint aura, he might be able to reduce the pressure he was feeling.”

But Lin Yun was calm because he wasn’t the same as he used to be, and he had more trump cards now. His cultivation at the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal, the Divine Firefly Sword, and his Astral Sword Intent that close to the pinnacle of complete mastery. If he released his cultivation that’s at the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, he could negate the pressure from the Whiteclothed Venerable.

But that was a powerful trump card, and he wouldn’t be able to use it as a trump card if he disclosed it. Most importantly, he hadn’t reached the pinnacle tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage yet, and he might be unable to suppress the Whiteclothed Venerable even if he brought it out. In the end, he made up his mind to use his sword intent.

He no longer hid his strength and released his Astral Sword Intent with his dual sword stars shining brightly with over a hundred galaxies above him. In the next second, the pressure he felt was immediately alleviated.

As he activated the two glory spirits, the dragon and phoenix within his violet palace began to soar as he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. Lin Yun's reaction speed increased when his nirvana aura filled his body.

“Oh my god!” The Whiteclothed Venerable exclaimed. He also grasped the Astral Sword Intent, and having over a hundred galaxies was no different from cheating. He grasped the Astral Sword Intent with great difficulty and was only one step away from greater mastery.

“Divine Firefly Sword!” Lin Yun merged with his sword and formed a tidal wave of sword aura, shattering the Whiteclothed Venerable’s sword ray that was empowered with greater dao, before his sword was aimed at the latter’s forehead.

This made the Whiteclothed Venerable’s face change, and he executed a mysterious movement technique, leaving behind ripples in the air. He dodged the attack just when Lin Yun’s sword brushed past his head.

At the same time, he unleashed his counterattack. The Heavenly Serpent Sword left his hand and aimed to coil around Lin Yun and stab at his neck from the back. This attack was hard to follow, and Lin Yun would reveal his back if he turned around.

But Lin Yun was calm as he released his hand on the Flower Burial Sword, and the sword flew out.
