Chapter 2101: Playful

“She’s not around here?” Lin Yun followed the trajectory Wang Muyan flew in and arrived in the Demonic Beast Forest. He saw a broken tree before him, but Wang Muyan’s aura wasn’t anywhere near there. He searched for hundreds of miles but could only see chaos with traces of sword intent left on the ground. This gave Lin Yun a first impression of the third variation's power. To a certain degree, it wasn’t because the Divine Solar Lunar Art was powerful but because his dual sword stars were powerful.

The two were perfectly fused. His dual sword stars entirely excavated the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal’s power, and this secret technique was almost tailor-made for him. Speaking of which, he had to thank Wang Muyan for that. It didn’t matter if Wang Muyan was setting up a trap for him or if she was trying to help him, but he benefited greatly from her, and he now had a powerful trump card. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“But where did she go?” Lin Yun was surprised because he couldn’t sense Wang Muyan’s aura.

“Over there!” Lil’ Purple finally couldn’t keep watching and pointed Lin Yun in a certain direction. She once secretly followed Wang Muyan for a long time, so she was sensitive to Wang Muyan’s aura. She was also the one who previously led Lin Yun to Wang Muyan on that rainy night.

In the end, Lin Yun passed through the woods and saw Wang Muyan in a river down the cliff. Wang Muyan was sitting in the river with her hands on her knees, emitting a crimson moonlight glow. But the moonlight didn’t feel evil. On the contrary, it felt peaceful, enveloping Wang Muyan in a sacred aura.

As moonlight shone down, Wang Muyan’s complexion gradually recovered. Her life was no longer in danger, but she was still weak. Her clothes were torn, revealing her voluptuous figure, a devilish figure that could pique the temptation of any man.

Even Lin Yun was slightly dazed after glancing at Wang Muyan. Even if Wang Muyan didn’t practice charming techniques, she was still fatally attractive to men.

But Lin Yun soon frowned when he noticed that something was strange about Wang Muyan. An invisible forcefield had enveloped a hundred meter-radius around her, causing the river to tremble. The ripple might seem small, but it contained a terrifying power that could inflict heavy injuries on anyone who carelessly stepped into the forcefield.

When Lin Yun flicked his finger, he unleashed a sword ray that was ripped into pieces by the invisible forcefield before even getting close to Wang Muyan. This made Lin Yun rejoice that he didn’t carelessly approach her.

.

“That’s the power that’s been sealed within her body, protecting her. This power is strong, and even I can’t help feeling a little afraid while sensing it,” Lil’ Purple cautiously said within the Iris Secret Realm while dropping her smile.

They had long discovered that a mysterious power was sealed within Wang Muyan’s body, but they didn’t know how powerful it was. Now that they looked at it again, the origin of that power must have been terrifying.

“Ye Qingtian, are you here to see if I’m dead?” Wang Muyan opened her eyes, but her eyes were filled with chill. She stopped speaking, and the invisible forcefield returned to her body. She still looked weak, but she wouldn’t be dying anytime soon. This was mainly because she underestimated Ye Qingtian and chose to clash head-on, resulting in her current state.

Lin Yun didn’t waste time with her and walked over after Wang Muyan removed that invisible forcefield. He then immediately grabbed her wrist and said, “Don’t move.”

“What are you trying to do?” Wang Muyan’s face changed, and she tried to struggle, but she was soon shocked to discover that Ye Qingtian had no malicious intentions. She could sense streams of blue dragon aura pouring into her body, and she was rapidly recovering from her injuries. While the blue dragon aura poured into her body, Wang Muyan briefly pondered before she stopped struggling.

It didn’t take long for Wang Muyan’s injuries to recover fully, and her pale face became rosy once more.

“You clearly couldn’t take my attack, so why did you face it head-on? What’s the matter? You can’t afford to lose?” Lin Yun let go of Wang Muyan’s wrist.

Wang Muyan’s face blushed, and she wanted to argue, but she didn’t know where to start because what Ye Qingtian said was true. According to the bet, she would have to tell Ye Qingtian the secrets of the Divine Solar Lunar Rune if she lost, and she also had to leave the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“I can void the bet, but you have to promise me something,” Lin Yun said.

“What’s your condition?” Wang Muyan looked at Ye Qingtian with her eyes lit up.

“No matter what you plan, you can’t harm the life of anyone in the Heavenly Dao Sect,” Lin Yun said after a brief consideration. Even if Wang Muyan left, she could still carry on with her plans, and the Heavenly Dao Sect might suffer heavy casualties then. He continued, “What happened to Bai Xiao cannot happen again.”

“You’re making things difficult for me. I can only ensure for myself and not others,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“I only need your promise, and I don’t care about others,” Lin Yun said. After thinking about it, this was the best he could do to minimize the loss since he couldn’t kill her for the time being.

“Also, I don’t need you to tell me the secrets of the Divine Solar Lunar Rune. I can roughly guess that it must have something to do with the seal on the God Burial Mountain Range,” Lin Yun said. He continued, “Furthermore, I can undo the Nether Shackles on you.”

Wang Muyan’s gaze flickered, and she suspiciously asked, “You’ve given me a huge surprise. But what good will you receive?”

“You want me to be of use to you, so you went easy on me multiple times. Furthermore, you also didn’t tell the Blood Moon Divine Son about my identity,” Lin Yun smiled. “I’ll believe you this once. Furthermore, it’s not like we don’t have opportunities to cooperate. In your words, I also want you to be of use to me.”

Wang Muyan was briefly stunned before she smiled, “I only want your body, but you want my heart.

“Don’t regret it!” Wang Muyan smiled and said in a playful tone, “Those who have played games like this with me have died a terrible death, and you’re playing with fire.”

Lin Yun smiled and replied in a playful tone, “Wang Muyan, I don’t know where you get your courage from. You’ve failed in my hands multiple times, so don’t act so confidently about it.”

Wang Muyan was stumped when she heard that, and a cold light flashed within her eyes, looking angry.

Lin Yun blinked his eyes and suddenly made a move. He grabbed Wang Muyan’s wrist and pressed his body over. This made Wang Muyan feel a masculine aura blowing in her face, instantly making her blush and nervous.

“Stop pretending. You might seem willing to accept whatever I do to you, looking bold and unrestrained, but I bet you haven’t tasted the union of men and women. I already saw through you when you showed cowardice back at Six Holy City, so stop pretending, Big Sister,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Let go of me, you rogue!” Wang Muyan struggled.

Lin Yun didn’t take another step further and released his grip on Wang Muyan’s wrist before placing his finger on her forehead. The Nether Shackles left within her body began to crumble, turning back into nether energy and returning to Lin Yun’s body.

This shocked Wang Muyan because Lin Yun really undid the Nether Shackle for her.

“Now, can we have a proper talk?” Lin Yun asked.

Wang Muyan took a deep breath and stared at Lin Yun, “You’re really terrifying. I have indeed not experienced the union between men and women. Those men in the past only indulged in their imagination.”

“Oh,” Lin Yun replied casually.

“I can promise you that I won’t take another life of anyone from the Heavenly Dao Sect as long as I’m here one day,” Wang Muyan said seriously. “But I must clarify that I will retrieve the Divine Solar Lunar Rune no matter what. Even if I don’t make a move, the Blood Moon Sect will make a move against it.”

Lin Yun fell silent, not saying a word.

“Hehe, don’t worry about her for now. Let her retrieve the Divine Solar Lunar Rune, then I’ll retrieve it from her,” Lil’ Purple smiled. She was troubled because she couldn’t find any clues about the Divine Solar Lunar Rune’s location.

“Remember your words,” Lin Yun replied. But just when he was about to leave, he said, “Oh, I forgot to tell you something. I have reached complete mastery of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. If I execute the Nether Shackles on you again, even a Saint might be unable to undo it.”

It was a form of warning, and it was also true. When Lin Yun undid the Nether Shackles for her, he noticed that the seal had loosened up, and Wang Muyan must’ve used other means when trying to break it. But it wouldn't be easy to resolve if he placed the Nether Shackle on her again.

“Wait, don’t go yet. I want to know how you won. I didn’t see you practice the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal,” Wang Muyan asked.

“Well, there’s no need to hide it from you. I’ve received a complete fist technique on the Heavenly Path, the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. The intent contained within this fist technique can be used on the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal. So although I might not have practiced anything for the past half a month, I only needed to compare it to the notes, then it became easy to figure them out. It might seem like I’ve been practicing my sword technique for half a month, but I’ve been fusing the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal with my sword dao comprehension,” Lin Yun said truthfully.

“You cheated! You lied to me right from the beginning!” Wang Muyan said furiously.

“Well, don’t speak like you’ve not cheated. You cheated first, and you’re the one who suggested the bet, Big Sister,” Lin Yun replied. He didn’t take her appeal seriously.

When Wang Muyan heard Lin Yun calling her ‘Big Sister,’ she nearly threw out a mouthful of blood. When she looked at the smile on Lin Yun’s face, she couldn’t help becoming angry with her chest heaving violently.

“By the way, you’re not entirely covered up,” Lin Yun said with a playful tone as he pointed at Wang Muyan.
