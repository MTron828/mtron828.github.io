Chapter 1354 - Fight (2)

A Golden Divine Dragon constellation with the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art, this was simply a perfect match. When the golden dragon claw descended, the immense pressure that it had formed began to crash down on Lin Yun’s sword aura.

Before the dragon claw could even descend, the surrounding land that had cracks spreading out due to the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda began to tremble.

With a pair of eyes like the sun and moon, freezing all of eternity with one thought!

As a dazzling sword intent exploded from Lin Yun, a golden painting flew out of his body. It was an Aurora Dragon painting that appeared in everyone’s eyes. When the painting unfolded, it suddenly began to grow in size and became extremely terrifying.

Slicing through the primeval chaos on the summit of Kunlun, unleashing great prowess as the sun rises.

But Lin Yun didn’t stop there. He easily brought out another painting from his body. It was a painting symbolizing one of the eight ominous beasts, the Winged Dragon. It was a snow-white primordial beast with a pair of wings on its back. At the same time, it was also enveloped in a powerful dragon aura that wasn’t at all inferior to Qin Cang’s Golden Divine Dragon constellation.

Just when everyone thought that that was it, another painting flew out of his body.

Qiongqi’s might sets the world, annihilating everything along with Yin and Yang.

This was the third painting that symbolized one of the eight primordial beasts, Qiongqi. When three ominous beasts appeared behind him, they formed into a boundless phenomenon that dyed the surrounding heavens and earth in multiple colors.

“Three paintings? Three constellations?!” When everyone saw the three paintings behind Lin Yun, everyone finally knew where Lin Yun got the confidence to face Qin Cang head-on.

“Die!” Qin Cang sneered. If Lin Yun didn’t have this much strength, then he would be too disappointed. The moment he finished, the Golden Dragon Seal emitted a boundless light that manifested into a dragon claw with five fingers that looked like five towering pillars before he charged toward Lin Yun with the dragon claw.

When the dragon claw flew over, the surrounding space was torn apart by meteorites that were enveloped in the dragon flames as they descended. This scene simply looked apocalyptic.

Raising his head, Lin Yun saw that those meteorites were actually lotuses being enveloped in black dragon flames. If Lin Yun was struck by those meteors, he definitely wouldn’t have a good outcome, even with his physique. Qin Cang was ranked first on the Empyrean Ranking, and he was someone who could fight against those who were on the Elysium Core Ranking. When everyone saw Qin Cang’s attack, they all knew that Qin Cang was serious this time.

“Lin Yun, let me see how you deal with my Golden Dragon Claw!” Qin Cang looked so arrogant and clearly spoke about his confidence in his Golden Dragon Seal. This was an attack that could even kill a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert.

“How will I deal with it? With one palm!” Lin Yun soared to the sky and reached out with his right hand. As the Blood Flame Divine Rune appeared in his palm, a thunderstorm began to spread out in the next moment, accompanied by the roar of an azure dragon.

When three thousand purple-golden dragon runes fused into his palm, a violent thunderstorm aura began to spread out as a chill flickered in Lin Yun’s eyes. While ielding three thousand dragon runes in his palm, it began to be enveloped in flames after being empowered by the Blood Flame Divine Rune.

With a single thought, the origin saint rune that was engraved on his elysium core began to circulate as a golden light poured into his palm.

“This is?” Everyone was shocked as they watched Lin Yun slowly raise his palm. On his palm, there were two terrifying runes that were intertwined together.

One was a golden rune, it was the origin saint rune, the Golden Crow Saint Rune. As for the other one, it was naturally the origin saint rune that had been upgraded to a divine rune, the Blood Flame Divine Rune.

This was the same as Lin Yun activating two origin saint runes at the same time. As a terrifying vortex of thunderstorms began to form in his palm, the three thousand purple-golden dragon runes were constantly being devoured by the vortex.

In the past, it was already powerful when Lin Yun used the Blood Flame Divine Rune. Now that it was further empowered by the Golden Crow Saint Rune, it further brought the Azure Dragon Grasp to an unprecedented height.

When Lin Yun raised his right hand, the surrounding space began to tremble before he unleashed his attack on the Golden Dragon Seal.

Practically in a split second, the powerful Golden Dragon Seal began to crumble, instantly destroying the golden dragon claw and the descending black lotuses.

But that wasn’t all. Lin Yun shot forth like a sword as an azure dragon roar echoed from his palm. Since his attack was empowered by the Golden Crow Saint Rune and Blood Flame Divine Rune, all the black lotuses in his path had instantly crumbled.

“Pitiful tricks!” Looking at Lin Yun charging towards him, Qin Cang let out a ferocious roar before he triggered the Golden Dragon Bone and charged forth.

When Lin Yun and Qin Cang clashed, they instantly exchanged over a hundred moves in the blink of an eye. When their constellations clashed together, the collision unleashed a terrifying fluctuation in the surroundings.

The shockwave from their collision was so terrifying that it enveloped everything within a thousand-mile radius. Regardless of whether it was the disciples from the Profound Sky Sect or the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party, they had long retreated because not even Greater Elysium Core Realm experts could protect themselves under this violent storm.

The scene of Qin Cang suppressing Lin Yun one-sidedly didn’t happen. Even after Qin Cang brought out his constellation, they were both evenly matched.

When Qin Cang and Lin Yun clashed once more, their collision resounded like a rumble of thunder in the sky that made everyone feel a hammer slamming down on their hearts. They were both clashing head-on without any fancy tricks.

The shock brought by the fight between Qin Cang and Lin Yun had left everyone dumbfounded, including the disciples of the powerful sects. When they looked at Qin Cang and Lin Yun again, they couldn’t help having fear flashing in their pupils.

Qin Cang’s strength was terrifying, but Lin Yun’s strength had far exceeded their imaginations. If Lin Yun defeated Qin Cang, then wouldn’t that mean that Lin Yun had replaced Qin Cang as the first on the Empyrean Ranking? Just thinking about that was simply too unbelievable.

Regardless of the outcome of their battle, Lin Yun’s strength would definitely send a shock throughout the Ancient Barren Domain after today. It was so much so that even the Ancient Saint Domain’s Divine Dragon Empire would hear about Flower Burial’s name. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Did that fellow really obtain the Great Saint Origin? This is simply too powerful…” Cang Yun’s mentality had crumbled while watching this fight from afar. He was still waiting for Lin Yun to be killed by Qin Cang so that he could snatch Lin Yun’s purple-golden dragon runes.

Those purple-golden dragon runes were filled with powerful vitality, so they wouldn’t disappear even after Lin Yun died. So it was a treasure to Cang Yun. This was also why Cang Yun couldn’t accept the reality after seeing Lin Yun and Qin Cang being evenly matched.

Another clash later, Lin Yun and Qin Cang both retreated. Qin Cang’s face was ugly because the strength revealed by Lin Yun had far exceeded his imagination. He didn’t expect that Lin Yun would be so powerful even after reaching the Elysium Core Realm. He even suspected that Lin Yun still had even more powerful trump cards.

“Qin Cang, let me return you with one sword!” As a roar exploded between the heavens and earth, Lin Yun, who was hovering in the sky, had his hair fluttering wildly in the wind.

As he formed the Golden Crow Seal, a pair of Golden Crow Wings that reached the length of twenty meters unfolded behind him. When the pair of Golden Crow Wings unfolded, Lin Yun began to emit a dazzling golden light.

In a split second, the golden light had dyed everything around the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda in gold. When Lin Yun was done, he summoned the Lightning Shadow Sword to his hand and his hair began to flutter violently in the wind, looking like a deity while emitting a powerful pressure.

As Lin Yun raised the Lightning Shadow Sword above his head, heaven and earth began to tremble under his rage and the light from his sword made all the stars lose their luster, creating a terrifying phenomenon.
