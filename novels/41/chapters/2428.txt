Chapter 2429 - Aid Radiant's Tribulation!

At the God Burial Mountain Range’s Fallen God Valley, Su Ziyao removed the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown from her head and changed it to a floral crown made with the Divine Mulberry Tree. Her face was cold but looked a lot more gentle.

Compared to the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, she preferred the floral crown that Lin Yun made. At the moment, she still hadn’t left the Fallen God Valley but was flying deeper into the God Burial Mountain Range, giving off eternal pressure as she shuttled through the air.

Four hours later, she came to the far end of the Flame Dragon River and soared to the sky as her vision began to expand with multiple Heavenly Voids appearing. She could sense some ancient existences moving about, shrouded in an evil aura.

After looking at it for a long time, she could even hear screams in her ears. Those were the Demonspirit Clan’s deities who were sealed. They were bearing unimaginable torture as they roared. Anyone could imagine the disaster they would bring to the Kunlun Realm if they were released. But fortunately, she had refined the Annihilation God Lord’s hand with a deity aura protecting her. Otherwise, the terrifying phenomena would be enough for her to lose herself in them since there were too many of them.

“If the Heavenly Path is reforged, the spiritual energy in the world will recover. These ancient existences will also be strengthened, breaking the seals and wreaking havoc in the Kunlun Realm,” Su Ziyao frowned. This was why it wasn’t easy to reforge the Heavenly Path. There were too many concerns.

Many locations that were like the God Burial Mountain Range were throughout the Kunlun Realm, but there were more sealed beneath the Kunlun Realm. If they couldn’t get rid of those Demonspirit Clan’s deities, the Heavenly Path couldn’t be reforged. Then again, it was impossible for mortals to kill deities, and even someone as strong as the Southern Emperor could only suppress them, not kill them.

Since ancient times, only the Iris Sword Saint managed to kill a deity as a mortal. If they wanted to reforge the Heavenly Path, they would have to eliminate all the hidden threats and the Demonspirit Clan in the God Burial Mountain Range.

“I wonder if he can grasp the Nirvana Dao,” Su Ziyao muttered with anticipation in her eyes. Su Ziyao was confident that she could reforge the Heavenly Path after she became a deity, but she couldn’t get rid of these hidden threats. But if it was Lin Yun, he might have a chance at doing so.

Seemingly to sense Su Ziyao’s gaze, those sinister beings concealed their auras. But some still released a roar, provoking Su Ziyao.

But Su Ziyao merely snorted before she left.

“Annihilation God’s aura and truth...” After Su Ziyao left, those who hid themselves emerged again with fear in their tones.

Su Ziyao was fast, and she sensed a fluctuation in Six Holy City just when she was about to leave the God Burial Mountain Range. She quickly concealed her aura and descended on the city.

At the city's heart, the Blood Moon Sect created a blood pool at the plaza with many saints guarding the surroundings. There were also many from the Demonspirit Clan and demonic corpses as they threw human cultivators into the blood pond.

The Ying River King, who previously fought with Lin Yun, was also around. He had recovered from his injuries and was chatting with Zhao Tianyu.

This made Su Ziyao frown. She had noticed that they were holding a ceremony. She immediately sensed this was a serious matter since the Blood Moon Sect picked a special time. Is it a coincidence that they chose now?

“Don’t worry about it. Everyone is paying attention to the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation, and even the Divine Dragon Empire’s attention isn’t here. We will succeed this time,” Zhao Tianyu smiled.

The Ying River King deeply said, “It looks like I will have to congratulate the Blood Moon Sect. After the ceremony, your ancestor will be able to be reborn from the divine maiden. At that time... the Blood Moon Sect’s sacred flame will spread throughout the Kunlun Realm.”

“Likewise. The seal of this God Burial Mountain Range will also be destroyed. Your Demonspirit Clan’s deities will break free from their seals, and the Demonspirit Clan won’t have to carry on hiding in the God Burial Mountain Range, at the very least,” Zhao Tianyu smiled.

The God Burial Mountain Range was an array that sealed all the Demonspirit Clan’s deities, which was a shackle on the Demonspirit Clan that even newborn Demonspirits like the Ying River King were trapped in God Burial Mountain Range.

Even if they occasionally managed to send someone out, they had to pay a great price. But if the God Burial Mountain Range’s seal was destroyed, since the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan shared the same interests, they wouldn’t have any sudden conflicts.

Su Ziyao decided to stay here for now upon seeing this.

In the Sword Sect, the entire sect was enveloped in a layer of crimson radiance. Outside the Sword Sect were countless demonic beasts trying to flee, and there were also Saint Realm demonic beasts amongst them. But this wasn’t a beast tide. Demonic beasts were brutal and invasive during a beast tide, but these demonic beasts had fear in them, wanting to leave this place quickly. When they ran into human cultivators, they didn’t attack but were trying to escape, leaving the Sword Sect as quickly as possible.

When some human cultivators attacked them, they didn’t even retaliate but focused on escaping. Compared to demonic cultivators, countless human cultivators were pouring towards the Sword Sect. There were some here to watch, some here to comprehend to make a breakthrough, and some here to help the Sword Sect. But the Sword Sect was completely closed, and they couldn’t even get close to the hundred and eight peaks in the outer region, not to mention the seven main peaks.

But most were here to fish for benefits, seeing if they could pick up a Great Saint or Saint Sovereign’s corpses during the battle, which would be an excellent opportunity for them.

“I don’t think the Sword Sect can bear it.”

“The Profound Sky Sect is too powerful. I took a peak and could sense the torrential aura from afar.”

“The three holy lands sent out all their experts. Even the Black Mountain’s Seven Saints have come!”

“I heard that the person behind Tian Xuanzi is the Empress. Several Ancient Saint Clans in the Divine Dragon Empire have entered the Profound Sky Sect.”

“The Radiant Sword Saint will die, and the Sword Sect will be wiped out for sure!” Everyone was discussing amongst themselves, but no one was optimistic about the Sword Sect. They all felt that the Radiant Sword Saint would die and the Sword Sect would be wiped out.

In the Scarlet Firmament Peak’s main hall in Sword Sect, Mu Xuankong summoned all the Saints to figure out a solution. But everyone’s faces were grave because the Sword Sect didn’t have enough people. Not including Mu Xuankong, the Sword Sect had ten Saints and two Saint Sovereign elders.

There were only two Great Saints, the Radiant Sword Saint’s junior brother Dustlight and the previous peak master of the Golden Firmament Peak. But the Dustlight Great Saint had an important duty while the old peak master was running out of lifespan, and his strength wasn’t significant amongst the Great Saints.

The Sword Sect could be considered impressive amongst the powerful sects to have such strength since most powerful sects only had a Great Saint at best. The strongest in their sect were mostly Saint Sovereigns.

In the powerful holy lands, Saints could be considered Grand Elders. But the Sword Sect wasn’t a holy land, and it couldn’t rival an actual holy land. As a result, everyone in the Sword Sect wore a grave expression.

“We don't even have enough people to protect the seven peaks. If the Great Profound Sword Array breaks, we will be finished,” the Golden Firmament Saint Lord sighed. The Great Profound Sword Array was powerful and could use seven main peaks with a hundred and eight smaller peaks to confront an Emperor. Even if the array was broken, Mu Xuankong could use the sect master’s token to draw power from the peaks for himself as long as he was in the Sword Sect, and the peaks would provide endless power to him.

This was the Sword Sect’s advantage when fighting on their home ground. As long as the peaks weren’t destroyed, they would have an endless energy flow, and Mu Xuankong could guard the Radiant Sword Saint. But if the Great Profound Sword Array was destroyed and the Profound Sky Sect’s men charged in, it was just a matter of time before the energy ran out.

No one spoke since everyone knew that the Sword Sect had devised a plan for the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation over the past two to three years. Even so, none of the Saints here were afraid because they knew that this was unavoidable, and there was no way the Sword Sect could avoid it.

That was especially true for Mu Xuankong, who was already prepared to die. When he wanted to say something, several deacons came in and went on their knees, “Sect master, the various peaks’ disciples aren’t willing to leave. They’re all gathered outside the main palace.”

“Sect Master, we can’t persuade them!”

“Aside from the outer sect’s disciples, no inner sect’s disciples are willing to leave, especially the various peaks’ saint disciples! They’re all gathered outside, unwilling to leave!” The faces of Mu Xuankong and the other saints changed when they heard that.

Mu Xuankong and the Saint Elders didn’t want the inner sect’s disciples to get involved, especially the saint disciples. Mu Xuankong only wanted to leave behind the deacons and old fellows like them, not wanting the younger generation to get involved.

“What are they trying to do?!” Mu Xuankong scolded and came out with everyone. But when he came out, they were stumped as they saw thousands of inner sect disciples standing before the main hall without a hint of fear on their faces. That was especially the case for saint disciples such as Ye Ziling, Zhao Yan, Gongsun Yan, Jin Xuanyi, Mu Qingqing, and Mu Xueqin as they stood at the front.

Ye Ziling was being fully nourished by the sect now with her potential unleashed, and she received the title of the True Dragon Lord. She now possessed the cultivation of a Saint Lord, and she became the leader of the younger generation after Lin Yun left.

“Ye Ziling, why are you messing around with them as the chief disciple?!” Mu Xuankong roared.

Ye Ziling looked at Mu Xuankong, and said, “I’m not messing around. We swore an oath before entering the sect that we would do our best for the Sword Sect. As long as the Sword Sect doesn’t return to being a holy land, we won’t stop progressing. Now that Martial Ancestor Radiant is undergoing his tribulation, the Sword Sect needs help. We’ve cultivated so many years for today, and we’re not afraid!”

Mu Xuankong’s hands trembled, and the Saints behind him had their eyes become watery. After all, this was the Sword Sect’s spirit.

Mu Xuankong contained his emotions, and said, “You guys will die if you stay behind. Leave immediately! We can’t let the Sword Sect’s inheritance be severed here!”

“As swordsmen, we’re not afraid of death!” Ye Ziling said firmly. She wasn’t being reckless and knew that it was dangerous, but that didn’t mean that it was useless. There were a hundred and eight peaks in the outer region, the nodes for the Great Profound Sword Array. Even if they only managed to protect a peak, it would mean more energy for the array. So even if they die, they won’t die in vain.

“Gongsun Yan, why are you still around? You joined the Sword Sect midway, and you’re not a traitor if you leave now,” Mu Xuankong turned to look at Gongsun Yan. Before Gongsun Yan joined the Sword Sect, he was known for being a coward. Mu Xuankong naturally knew that, and he wanted Gongsun Yan to take the lead to leave.

Gongsun Yan smiled, “Sect Master, am I not a disciple of the Sword Sect? I’ll be honest with you. I’m a coward, and I’m not suitable as a swordsman compared to my other martial siblings. But I know that I can’t leave now. At the very least, I have to let Lin Yun know that I’m a swordsman before he returns! Eight thousand years of reign with our halo enveloping ninety thousand miles. As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies! I have sworn before the monument!”

Gongsun Yan’s words shocked Mu Xuankong and everyone present became even more determined after hearing what he said.

““As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies! We’re not afraid of death as swordsmen!””

““As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies! We’re not afraid of death as swordsmen!””

Their eyes were firm as they chanted to express their determination. They would never flee but live and die with the Sword Sect. Their voices echoed throughout the Sword Sect, leaving Mu Xuankong and the other saints dumbfounded, unable to say a word.

Suddenly, a radiant voice echoed outside the Sword Sect, “Profound Valley’s Sect Master, Li Moyou, is here to help the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation!”

“The Heavenly Note Sect is here to help the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation!”

“The Heavenly Blade Pavilion is here to help the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“The Vajra Monastery is here to help the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation!”

“The Thunder Sect is here to help the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation!”

“The Emerald Jade Manor is here to help the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation!”

“Sect Master, please open the sect!” Six sects of the eight powerful sects within the Ancient Barren Domain came over. Their sect masters came over themselves and were outside the Sword Sect, asking Mu Xuankong to open the sect.

“The six sect masters can be trusted,” the Golden Firmament Saint Lord said with their eyes lighting up.

But that wasn’t all, another resounding voice resounded, “Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple Ye Guhan, Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, Dragon Origin Great Saint, and Serene Dust Great Saint are here to help Master during his tribulation! Sect Master, please open the sect!”

Ye Guhan’s voice echoed across the nine heavens, which made the eyes of everyone from the Sword Sect light up.

“The Azure River Sword Saint is here!”

“The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint is also here? Isn’t she one of the Three Sword Saints in the Eastern Desolation as well?”

“Senior Dragon Origin and Serene Dust are also Great Saints!”

“Four Great Saints!” The six sect masters were only Saint Sovereigns, and their arrival boosted everyone’s morale. But they were pale in comparison to the arrival of four Great Saints.

“Where is the Sword Sect’s Sect Master? The Divine Phoenix Holy Master is here with reinforcements from the Divine Phoenix Mountain. Please open the sect! We have an agreement with Flower Burial, and we’re here to help the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation!” Before everyone could stop rejoicing, another voice shocked everyone in the Sword Sect.

No one expected that the Divine Phoenix Holy Master was also here since the Divine Phoenix Mountain was now the strongest holy land within the Eastern Desolation.

“The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s Azure Python Great Saint is here under the agreement with Flower Burial to help the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation!” Another voice echoed, accompanied by a dragon’s roar that echoed in the surroundings like a bell.
