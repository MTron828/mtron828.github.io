Chapter 2178 - Invincible

Lin Yun repeatedly promised the Indigothunder Peak Master that he would keep a low profile before he returned to his courtyard and entered the Iris Secret Realm. He was practically certain that something would happen on the ninth of next month, but he didn’t know what exactly would happen.0

“It looks like Wang Muyan wasn’t lying. The Blood Moon Sect might do something on that day,” Lil’ Purple said.0

“Where did the Blood Moon Sect get their guts from?” Lin Yun still couldn’t believe it. After all, the Heavenly Dao Sect was an ancient holy land with a terrifying foundation.0Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The Heavenly Dao Sect is riddled with holes. Since Ye Guhan could arrange for you to enter, I don’t believe the other clans can’t make arrangements to let people from the Blood Moon Sect in.” Lil’ Purple tugged her arms together. “The Heavenly Dao Sect isn’t a place to stay because you won’t be able to determine the enemies and friends at that time. The Heavenly Dao Sect might seem like a colossus, but it might not even be compared to the Sword Sect.”0

Lin Yun said nothing about that because the Sword Sect was at least united, unlike the Heavenly Dao Sect. The four major clans had their own agendas, and only a few were concerned about the sect. The Thousand Plume Great Saint might seem like a leader in the Heavenly Dao Sect, but he was also from the Ye Clan. It’s just that he went separate ways from the Ye Clan.0

“Let’s not think about that and look at the rewards first.” Lin Yun took out the interspatial pouch that Ye Guhan gave him, taking everything that was within out. An ancient cauldron appeared before him, and it gave off a strong oppression.0

The moment the cauldron appeared, Lil’ Purple gently landed on it, and she was dumbfounded. “Holy shit, the Thousand Plume Great Saint is really generous. This is really half a cauldron of eighth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid.”0

A dense aroma came from the True Dragon Saint Liquid, signifying that it was refined from the blood of Jiao-Dragons, while using many saint elixirs.0

Lin Yun gently leaped and landed beside Lil’ Purple, standing on the cauldron as he lowered his head. Half of the cauldron was filled with eighth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid, looking endless. The cauldron itself was a space artifact that contained True Dragon Saint Liquid. So there was more True Dragon Saint Liquid there than it looked.0

“How many kilograms are there?” Lin Yun could feel his scalp go numb with disbelief. In the past, all of the resources he had obtained were through putting his life on the line. But this time, he received so many resources just because of his title as the Heavenly Dragon Lord.0

“At least 250,000 kilograms,” Lil’ Purple gulped down a mouthful of saliva with her eyes shining brightly. “My tree can finally grow now! The Thousand Plume Great Saint is a good person!”0

Aside from that, there were 50,000 kilograms of ninth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid contained in a jar.0

“That’s mine! No one is allowed to snatch it from me!” Lil’ Purple hugged the jar and was so emotional that she was about to cry. The eighth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid was refined with the blood of Jiao-Dragon, and ninth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid was refined with the blood of True Dragons, combined with multiple precious saint elixirs.0

It might only seem to be 50,000 kilograms, but the ninth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid was even more precious, while the eighth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid was in large numbers.0

“Which one will you pick?” Lin Yun smiled.0

Lil’ Purple looked at the cauldron and the jar in her hands, falling into a dilemma. She said in a pitiful voice, “It’s too hard to pick. Can I have it all?”0

Lin Yun laughed, and said with contempt, “Just look at you. Don’t forget that there is also 500 kilograms of Divine Dragon Saint Liquid.”0

 “Oh, yeah! That’s right, take it out and let me have a look!” Lil’ Purple said with her eyes shining brightly. The Divine Dragon Saint Liquid was refined with the blood of Divine Dragons, and the value was unimaginable. Even Lin Yun couldn’t find a word to describe it.0

The 500 kilograms of Divine Dragon Saint Liquid was placed in a gourd. The gourd looked exquisite, and one would think that it contained a fine wine if they didn’t take a better look at it.0

“This is the true treasure. It’s rare even in ancient times. Mhm? Why is there a crack on the jar?” Lil’ Purple’s face suddenly changed as she pointed at the jar containing the ninth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquids with surprise.0

Lin Yun was also shocked as he quickly examined the jar. After all, the jar contained treasures, and he would feel heartache if there was any damage to the jar. He checked the jar carefully, then he said, “There aren’t any cracks on it.”0

On the other hand, Lil’ Purple was holding the gourd to her mouth, gulping it down with her face becoming red. This instantly made the corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched, and he knew that he was careless.0

“Hehe, I’m trying it out for you and seeing if it’s poisonous,” Lil’ Purple said with a guilty smile as she wiped her lips.0

Lin Yun shook the gourd, realizing that Lil’ Purple had drank a lot in that gulp. He furiously asked, “So, is it poisonous?”0

He was fortunate that the gourd contained 500 kilograms of Divine Dragon Saint Liquid, and that the amount Lil’ Purple drank wasn’t a lot.0

“You don’t have to worry about it. It’s not poisonous!” Lil’ Purple said righteously. But after she finished, she couldn’t help letting out a hiccup with a bashful expression on her face.0

This left Lin Yun stunned, before he asked, “How much did you drink?”0

“Ten-odd kilograms?” Lil’ Purple said sheepishly.0

This left Lin Yun speechless as he looked at the gourd. He couldn’t imagine how a young girl could drink ten-odd kilograms with just one mouthful. He smiled bitterly, then knocked on Lil’ Purple’s head, “You can really drink.”0

But when he knocked on Lil’ Purple’s head, a terrifying saint radiance shone from her forehead with a shockwave spreading out. This caught Lin Yun by surprise as he was sent flying away, knocking against the ancient cauldron. But it was fortunate that he wasn’t injured. He then flew over to the cauldron, wanting to stop the cauldron from toppling over.0

“What’s with her? The Divine Dragon Saint Liquid is so powerful?” Lin Yun was surprised as he lowered his head to look at the gourd in his hand. He never heard that the Divine Dragon Saint Liquid could be drunken like wine.0

While the radiance released from Lil’ Purple became even more intense, she had her eyes closed while hovering in the air as her hair began to grow. Her hair turned yellow, reaching her waist length. Her face also looked a little more mature, and she had grown a little.0

Lin Yun wasn’t too surprised because Lil’ Purple’s hair would become silver whenever she used her full strength, and she would also have an ethereal temperament. This wasn’t the first time he had seen this, but it looked like she was going to make a breakthrough. Right then, a black shadow rushed over. It was Lil’ Red, who looked at the gourd pitifully.0

“Go on,” Lin Yun smiled as he handed the gourd to Lil’ Red.0

Lil’ Red grinned and began gulping down the Divine Dragon Saint Liquid. It wasn’t courteous at all, and its stomach soon swelled from drinking the Divine Dragon Saint Liquid.0

“T-Thank you, big brother.” Lil’ Red smiled as it handed the gourd back before it fled.0

When Lin Yun shook the gourd, he could sense that the weight of the gourd had become much lighter.0

“They’re really not polite at all,” Lin Yun said, but he wore a smile on his face. He could sense that Lil’ Red and Lil’ Purple were going to make a breakthrough, so this was a piece of good news to him.0

“There’s about 400 kilograms left, and it should be enough for me.” Lin Yun shook the gourd and fell into deep thoughts. He didn’t plan on using it now, since it was too much of a waste to drink it like how Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red drank it.0

As for the eighth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid, Lin Yun planned to give it all to Lil’ Purple to water the Phoenix Tree. Lin Yun was also looking forward to the tree growing up, and wanted to see if it could become comparable to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. At that time, he would be carrying half a holy land wherever he went.0

As for the ninth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid, Lin Yun planned to use them himself to cultivate the Azure Draogn Divine Physique. As for the Divine Dragon Saint Liquid, there was too little of it, so Lin Yun planned to use it when making a breakthrough in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon.0

He took out a metal fragment from the interspatial pouch along with a golden jade slip. The jade slip was a relatively complete version of the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal. As for the metal fragment, Lin Yun briefly studied it and guessed that it should be a fragment of the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron.0

“What’s this?” But that wasn’t all as Lin Yun took out a crystal bottle from the interspatial pouch. This bottle was weird and it was completely sealed, looking as though it was naturally sealed. But the bottle wasn’t the most important thing but the golden liquid within it. Lin Yun could sense a surge of dizziness when he looked at it for a long time. He could sense that there was a terrifying pressure coming from this blood.0

“Divine Blood!” Lin Yun suddenly realized what treasure this was, and his face drastically changed. Didn’t the Thousand Plume Great Saint say that he would give him Divine Blood after he reached the Saint Realm? So why did the Thousand Plume Great Saint give it to him now?0

Lin Yun looked at the crystal bottle with his face becoming uneasily, before he recalled what his senior brother said. Even the most valuable treasure in the world wouldn’t be that precious when a person was going to die. This reward was something that not even Holy Sons could obtain. This meant that something wasn’t right.0

The Thousand Plume Great Saint gave off a feeling that he was preparing his funeral, giving it to him so that it wouldn’t fall into the hands of others.0

“Can it be that Senior Brother was right?” Lin Yun’s face became grave. As one of the leaders with the highest status within the Heavenly Dao Sect, the Thousand Plume Great Saint must be bearing a greater pressure. The latter must know more than Lin Yun, who had already noticed the threat within the Heavenly Dao Sect over the past year, but the Thousand Plume Great Saint must have been watching for the past few hundred years. So the Thousand Plume Great Saint knew better than anyone about the trouble within the Heavenly Dao Sect.0

“Ninth of next month…” Lin Yun held onto the crystal bottle and his face became grave.0

“You two don’t have to think too much about the ninth of next month. Just wait for the ceremony to be completed. The Emperor Sword has been lost for so many years, and I also don’t have any hope in bringing it back through this ceremony,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said with the Dao Yang Holy Son and Holy Spirit Son standing in front of him.0

Earlier, the Dao Yang Holy Son was saying that he noticed that the Heavenly Yin Palace had been becoming more mysterious recently, and no one could enter the Heavenly Yin Palace. There were also some peaks with surging undercurrents. The Dao Yang Holy Son was afraid that something might happen during the ceremony. This was why the Thousand Plume Great Saint comforted him.0

“I have thought it through. There are some things that even I’m powerless to face against, even when I’ve reached the pinnacle of the Saint Realm,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint sighed. “The Azure River Sword Saint is right. We should be the ones bearing it as seniors, and we shouldn’t force it on the juniors. Young people should look like young people; there’s no need for them to bear so much pressure. Even if the Heavenly Dao Sect is destroyed, it can make a comeback as long as our inheritance still exists, and I believe the Heavenly Dao Sect will reach its peak once more.”0

The Dao Yang Holy Son’s face changed because he could tell from the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s tone that he didn’t have much hope, giving off the feeling as though he had seen through death. It was as though the Thousand Plume Great Saint was giving his last words.0

“Master, there’s no need to be so pessimistic. With the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword around, there won’t be any troubles,” the Dao Yang Holy Son said after a brief pondering.0

“You don’t understand. The Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword don’t exist for the Heavenly Dao Sect, but the Eastern Desolation. If we have a sect master, an Emperor Realm expert, and the Emperor Sword…” The Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled. He couldn’t carry on any further because there weren’t so many ‘ifs’ in the world.0

The reality was that they had nothing except a bunch of pests who were only concerned with the interests of their clans and not the sect.0

“No need to say any further.” The Thousand Plume Great Saint recollected his thoughts, and said, “For so many years, one of you has been in the light, while the other was in the dark. I have devoted my efforts in nurturing the two of you, so the two of you just have to do as I say. Remember, the Dao Yang Holy Son is in the light, while the Holy Spirit Son will be in the dark in the future.”
