Chapter 1663 – Heaven Sword Form!

Tian Xuanzi’s words made everyone’s faces change into shock. The Saint Realm was separated into Saint Lord, Saint Sovereign, and Great Saint. They might still be in the Saint Realm, but there was a massive difference between each stage, so they cannot be treated as the same. As for above the Saint Realm, it would be the legendary Emperor Realm.

In the past, Tian Xuanzi was addressed as the Profound Sky Saint Sovereign. He was very young, and no one knew his exact age. They could only be sure that he was barely three hundred years old, known as the strongest genius in the past millennium to appear in the Eastern Desolation, and his cultivating speed had shocked everyone.

Everyone was shocked that he could become a Saint Sovereign at such a young age, but who knew that he had become a Great Saint without anyone realizing it? Mu Xuankong, Chen Yu, the Heavenly Note Sect’s sect master, and the Profound Valley’s valley master were also shocked. All four of them were Saint Sovereigns, and they knew better than others how tough it was to become a Great Saint.

“This fellow is really a monster…” Lil’ Purple raised her head and muttered. Although she didn’t like Tian Xuanzi, she had to admit that his strength and talent had won her respect. After the Golden Era, when spiritual energy began to fall, cultivating in this era was equivalent to ancient times. But even in ancient times, there was never such a young Great Saint.

“Great Saint? How is this possible?!” For the first time, Chen Yu’s fighting spirits wavered as he looked at Tian Xuanzi.

“I haven’t been a Saint Sovereign since ten years ago.” Tian Xuanzi said. “Give me another hundred years, and I will definitely reach the Emperor Realm! At that time, I’ll be invincible as long as the Nine Emperors don’t appear, and the Profound Sky Sect will become a holy land. In my hands, the Ancient Barren Domain will rise again! Mu Xuankong, do you now know how wrong you are?”

“Ha. So your Profound Sky Sect wants to bury my Sword Sect to rise? This is why you have to kill the geniuses of my Sword Sect? That’s not how the world works. Martial Uncle Radiant already saw through your ambitions, but he didn’t kill you because of your talent. He probably didn’t expect that his mercy created an enemy for us!” Mu Xuankong sneered.

“Hahaha!” Tian Xuanzi started laughing. “Mu Xuankong, you’re wrong! If the Profound Sky Sect wants to become a holy land, we’ll have to use the Sword Sect as a stepping stone. As for why the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t kill me? You’re overthinking it. Since when have I begged him not to kill me?”

The corner of Mu Xuankong’s lips twitched because Tian Xuanzi was really invincible when he became shameless.

“Since the four of you don’t know what’s right, I’ll show you guys the huge gap between us!” Tian Xuanzi flicked his finger, and a purple petal flew out from his hand. The petal was unbelievably fast, leaving a crack on the Sovereign Saint Diagram created by the Profound Valley’s valley master.

“How is this possible?!” This naturally made the Profound Valley’s valley master’s face drastically change because there was a crack on the Sovereign Saint Diagram, and its divine runes were crumbling.

But Tian Xuanzi didn’t stop there. He destroyed the Sovereign Saint Diagram with a palm. As the Heavenly Gold, Heavenly Wood, Heavenly Water, Heavenly Fire, and Heavenly Earth wheels flew out from his body, this sent the Profound Valley’s valley master flying back, throwing a mouthful of blood with his Saint Constellation crumbling.

He flew a thousand miles away before smashing against the ground, creating an unimaginably colossal crater. The crater was so huge that it looked like a meteorite made it.

Tian Xuanzi turned around and pushed out his palm once more. He divided himself into two, and the two Tian Xuanzis turned into streaks of light that swept up Mu Xuankong and Chen Yu. As the surrounding saint daos changed, space distorted, and the two Tian Xuanzis combined back into one.

As for Mu Xuankong and Xuan Yu, they took a palm from Tian Xuanzi before they could respond and were sent flying away.

Wearing a smile, Tian Xuanzi was like a person who came out of a painting, and his palm landed on Chen Yu and Mu Xuankong’s chests again. His palm shattered their blade and sword intents, causing the two to throw out a mouthful of blood.

Seeing that they still wanted to retaliate, Tian Xuanzi flicked his finger, knocking away the incoming sword and blade before waving his hand and sending them flying back. “So stubborn. Get lost!”

Everything happened too quickly. It all took place in the blink of an eye. This made the face of the Heavenly Note Sect’s sect master change. But just when she was about to make a move, Tian Xuanzi turned his gaze over. His left pupil had the Heavenly Sun engraved in it, and his right pupil had the Heavenly Moon engraved in it. As his pupils shone, sunlight and moonlight were released from them.

With just one look, the Heavenly Note Sect’s sect master could feel a massive pressure descending onto her, and she fell from the sky like a broken kite.

“Sorry, but I don’t have a habit of hitting women.” Tian Xuanzi gave the Heavenly Note Sect’s sect master a smile, causing the latter to throw out another blood from the anger.

The surroundings fell into silence, with everyone being shocked. The shock they felt wasn’t inferior to when Lin Yun slew a Saint Lord. Tian Xuanzi was a little unbelievably strong.

Everyone knew that Tian Xuanzi was strong and talented and supported the rise of the entire Profound Sky Sect by himself. But they never expected that Tian Xuanzi would be this powerful. Based on the strength he had shown so far, who else in the Ancient Barren Domain could compete with him as long as the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t appear?

Lin Yun was concerned when he saw Mu Xuankong fly away and wanted to head over. But when a gaze fell onto him, Lin Yun turned his head and saw Tian Xuanzi looking at him.

Tian Xuanzi smiled, “Please don’t move. Otherwise, there might be death.”

This made Lin Yun throw out a mouthful of blood as he fell to his knees, clutching his chest. His injuries that had recovered a little had worsened again. But there was nothing Lin Yun could do but clench his right fist and raise his head to look at Tian Xuanzi with killing intent filled in his pupils. He knew that Tian Xuanzi was warning him not to move.

Gritting his teeth, Lin Yun forced his words out of his teeth, “Tian Xuanzi, I swear that I’ll take your life as long as I don’t die today!”

But Tian Xuanzi merely smiled and wasn’t bothered by what Lin Yun said. He glanced at Lin Yun before he descended from the sky.

“Radiant, how long are you going to watch? I'll start a massacre if you don’t show up now.” Tian Xuanzi smirked.

Those words made Lin Yun’s heart sink because he knew that Tian Xuanzi really was after his master, making his heart a mess.

“Calm down.” Lil’ Purple said, holding onto Lin Yun’s hand.

A black figure suddenly dashed over. Lil' Red then appeared before Lin Yun. Once the three of them had gathered together, Lin Yun finally felt a little relieved and swiftly tried to find a solution to this matter.

Tian Xuanzi’s main objective was to force his master to appear. So this meant that it didn’t matter if he was around because Tian Xuanzi would still try to force his master to come out of his abode.

Despite claiming that he would become an Emperor within a century, Tian Xuanzi was still afraid of his master. This was why he tried to probe the Radiant Sword Saint when he first saw Lin Yun. As for today, all his plans were to ensure that his master would leave his abode and wouldn’t make it through his tribulation. Lin Yun had to admit that Tian Xuanzi was vicious. He had never seen such a vicious person before.

He could only inwardly pray that his master wouldn’t fall for it and just focus on his tribulation. But he would ultimately be disappointed. A figure had descended from the sky. When the light enveloping that person faded away, the Radiant Sword Saint appeared, facing Tian Xuanzi.

But the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t look at Tian Xuanzi, nor did he look at anyone else. The moment he arrived, he flew towards Lin Yun.

But just when the Radiant Sword Saint moved, a face appeared before him, wearing a smile. This made the Radiant Sword Saint furrow his brows. When he changed directions, Tian Xuanzi appeared before him once more. This process repeated three times. Tian Xuanzi was determined to keep the Radiant Sword Saint from reaching Lin Yun.

When they faced each other the fourth time, they both pushed out a palm. These palms manifested into a massive phenomenon, one side was a starry sky, and the other was an endless sword ocean.

When the two palms clashed, the thirty-six layers of heaven couldn’t bear the heavy stress, and cracks began to appear. The shockwave of their attacks implicated many beasts, continents, cities, and even ancient palaces in the thirty-six layers of heaven, destroying them.

Raising their heads, everyone could feel their hearts pumping violently. This is the strength of Great Saints?

In the past, the thirty-six layers of heaven would only crack, regardless of any fight. But today, the attacks from two Great Saints tore the sky apart, and the crack was over a few myriad miles in size.

“Radiant, you’ve really become old.” Tian Xuanzi looked at the Radiant Sword Saint. The latter’s face was wrinkled, and his grey hair was mixed with white. His face was also covered with a deathly aura. This was a sign that he was running out of lifespan.

No matter how strong one person could be, they couldn’t hide their deathly aura when their lifespan was coming to an end.

“If you weren’t running out of lifespan, I would’ve lost from that palm alone.” Tian Xuanzi said.

But the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t say a word. He merely looked at Tian Xuanzi coldly.

Shaking his head, Tian Xuanzi looked at the Radiant Sword Saint with disappointment. He sighed, “It’s easy to be softhearted after becoming old. You came here despite knowing that you’ll die. Perhaps you should consider why you cannot make it through your tribulation. After all, many people who were inferior to you reached the Emperor Realm, but you can’t…”

“How I face my tribulation has nothing to do with you.” The Radiant Sword Saint said. “There will be a battle between us, but we’re not in a hurry now. Let me take a look at my disciple, first.”

“The Radiant Sword Saint of the past was almighty, blocking the invasion of five holy lands with one sword alone. I have witnessed that battle, and I remembered how you supported the entire Ancient Barren Domain alone with your sword. You weren’t inferior to anyone, even when compared to the Sword Emperor.” Tian Xuanzi smiled.

“Alas…” Tian Xuanzi then sighed and shook his head, “He’s just a brat, so why are you so protective of him? Moreover, is it more important than you becoming an Emperor? You’ve really become old, becoming soft-hearted. Your heart as a swordsman has rusted, and you wouldn’t have been able to avoid death, even if I didn’t do anything.”

“You’ve yet to answer my question.” The Radiant Sword Saint said.

“No can do. You’re ultimately the Radiant Sword Saint, a Saint with ‘Sword’ as your title. If I had the confidence to defeat you, I would’ve slaughtered my way to the Sword Sect and not have to wait till now. I naturally have my purpose of keeping him alive. Don’t tell me that you can’t guess it.” Tian Xuanzi smiled, shaking his head.

Hearing what Tian Xuanzi said, the Radiant Sword Saint’s eyes became even colder.

Looking at this, Tian Xuanzi smiled. He was satisfied with the Radiant Sword Saint’s response because he knew that the Radiant Sword Saint’s heart was messed up.

“Make your move. I know who you’re waiting for, but he won’t be coming!” Fighting spirits blazed within Tian Xuanzi’s pupils, and his expression became distorted with madness. This was because he had waited a long time for today.

He wanted to kill the Radiant Sword Saint, to make this sword saint become a stepping stone for him, Tian Xuanzi. When his killing intent swept out like a hurricane, he said, “Junior Tian Xuanzi, wishes to challenge the Radiant Sword Saint!”

His voice echoed, and the entire Ancient Barren Domain could sense his endless fighting spirits. His voice also caused countless mountains and cities to tremble under his fighting spirits.

But the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t bother with Tian Xuanzi. His expression was still indifferent. He looked at Mu Xuankong, Chen Yu, Mu Chuan, Ye Ziling, and everyone from the other sects. His eyes captured everything in the world except for Tian Xuanzi. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the end, his gaze fell on Lin Yun, and he wore a smile on his wrinkled face, “Lin Yun, do you remember what you said to me before you left for the Ancient Barren Battlefield?”

In a trembling voice, Lin Yun’s heart was filled with sorrow and he bit his lips, “Disciple said that I won’t let down master’s teachings in this trip to the Ancient Barren Battlefield!”

“Hahaha!” The Radiant Sword Saint laughed and waved his hand. When the Flower Burial Sword flew into his hand, his laughter continued, “Master also won’t let you down. The Carefree 9 Swords, let me teach it to you once more. The first sword… Heaven Sword Form!”

As he spoke, the Radiant Sword Saint shook his wrist, executing a sword technique Lin Yun was highly familiar with. It was the first form of the Carefree 9 Swords—Heaven Sword Form!
