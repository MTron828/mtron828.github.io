Chapter 2374 - Kill Flower Burial First!

When the six geniuses returned, they looked pathetic while returning with some of their sect’s disciples, also covered in wounds. They had suffered badly at the hands of the demonic corpses.

“Lin Yun!” Seeing Lin Yun’s smile, the six geniuses gritted their teeth.

“That bastard...” Tuoba Hong had a fiery temper, and he wanted to make a move right then.

But Heavenly Book held onto him, saying, “Calm down. This is the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain, and you’ll be dead if you make a move.”

When Tuoba Hong saw Profound Sky Venerable beside Lin Yun, fear flashed through his eyes, so he calmed down.

“That fellow obtained the golden spirit core, so there’s no opportunity to teach him a lesson,” Heavenly Book sighed with disappointment. The moment he said that, the faces of the other five also became ugly. After all, their perfectly planned scheme went down the drain. Jiang Ziyao’s face was hideous since he hadn't recovered from Lin Jiangxian’s sword yet.

“There’s no needs to hurry. Wait for the Venerable to announce the last stage,” Qin Yun said as everyone became quiet and looked at Profound Sky Venerable, waiting for him to announce the rules for the last stage.

“Ji Zixi, stay here. You guys go down,” Profound Sky Venerable said, chasing everyone away from Ji Zixi. He continued, “The golden spirit core has been given to me by Kunlun Realm’s Ji Zixi, and she will receive a direct ticket to the Heavenly Barren Banquet. As for the remaining nine quotas, they will be competed for amongst those who have obtained a hundred spirit cores.”

The moment he said that, everyone turned to look at Lin Yun with disbelief.

“No wonder why they went to look for Profound Sky Venerable together. Lin Yun is really generous...”

“The other geniuses won’t let him go...”

“He probably can’t go to the Heavenly Barren Banquet now.”

Everyone was shocked by what Profound Sky Venerable said. The six geniuses were also briefly stunned before a smile rose on their faces.

Heavenly Book smiled, “He’s really bold. He doesn’t know how ‘death’ is spelled.”

“We can take revenge now,” Jiang Ziyao smiled as everyone looked at Lin Yun with hostility.

But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered and maintained a smile on his face. For the next round, the twenty-eight who had obtained a hundred spirit cores will compete over the nine quotas.

Aside from the six known geniuses, the other cultivators who had gathered a hundred spirit cores were also geniuses from different sects, such as the branch of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion. Aside from Jiang Ziyao, seven divine disciples had also gathered a hundred spirit cores. Relying on the sword array, they managed to collect enough spirit cores.

Next would be Shangguan Jue and Zhao Zhanli from the Shadow Divine Palace, who also gathered a hundred spirit cores.

As for Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue, they relied on Lin Yun to obtain a hundred spirit cores. That was the same for the remaining geniuses. They had relied on a peerless genius to be qualified.

Profound Sky Venerable waved his hand and nine lotuses appeared on the stage. He said, “The last round is simple. There aren’t any restrictions aside from no Sovereign Saint Artifacts, and you have to sit on the lotus and activate it to be qualified.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thought because the rules for the last round were simple. This meant that they could form an alliance or gang up on someone, making everyone’s faces change.

Ji Zixi asked, “Venerable, what if someone joins hands?”

“There aren’t any restrictions on that,” Profound sky Venerable said.

Ji Zixi’s face changed upon hearing that before she turned to look at Lin Yun. Many people found it a pity because they knew what Ji Zixi was worried about.

The six geniuses exchanged a gaze, and they smiled.

Xiong Tiannan raised his head to look at Profound Sky Venerable, and roared, “Venerable, this isn’t fair!”

His words naturally sparked an agreement amongst everyone.

Jiang Ziyao raised his voice, “I find it fair!”

Heavenly Book waved his fan, and smiled, “Fair? We didn’t even say anything about it, and who the hell do you think you are? You’re only Flower Burial’s dog, and yet you think you could come so far without him? How dare you talk about fairness!”

Heavenly Book’s voice made Xiong Tiannan’s face turn red, and Ao Jue quickly held onto him.

Lin Yun said nothing as he pondered what Profound Sky Venerable said, then he noticed something.

Dao Sect’s Qin Yun said, “I find it fair. There are nine quotas, so they will only go to those who are capable.”

Murderous intent gathered in Tuoba Hong’s eyes, and he turned to Profound Sky Venerable. He asked a question that made everyone feel a chill down their spine, “I don’t dare question about the fairness. Venerable, I have a diffrrent question. Are we allowed to kill?”

“Killing isn’t forbidden, and you can give up. I will protect those who gave up,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

Tuoba Hong smiled and looked at Lin Yun, “Then I’ll kill him before he can give up. That means you can’t protect him, right?”

Profound Sky Venerable nodded upon hearing that question.

“Good!” Tuoba Hong wore a sinister smile.

Mu Qianxue and Can Jue exchanged a gaze, before they said, ““We have no problem with it. We find it fair.””

With the six geniuses acknowledging the rules, everyone else echoed along. Seeing this, Heavenly Book smiled, “Xiong Tiannan, do you have any other opinions? We all find it fair.”

Xiong Tiannan was furious. But just when he wanted to say something, he was interrupted by Lin Yun, who asked, “Venerable, I have something to say.”

Lin Yun’s voice drew everyone’s attention, and he continued, “If someone activates the lotus, does that mean that they can’t make a move anymore?”

“That’s for sure. Once the quotas are determined, they can’t be involved in the fight,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

“I have no other questions,” Lin Yun said.

“You don’t think that we will give you the chance to do that, right?” Jiang Ziyao sneered.

Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered to reply, which only made Jiang Ziyao even more furious. He gritted his teeth, “Let me see if you can still be arrogant later!”

Jiang Ziyao was furious because this wasn’t the first time Lin Yun ignored him.

“There’s no need to hurry. We have plenty of time to deal with him,” Heavenly Book calmly said.

“Since there are no more questions, let us... begin!” The Profound Sky Venerable said as he waved his hand, clearing everyone else who was on the stage, leaving behind twenty-eight people and the nine lotuses.

“Kill Flower Burial first before competing for the lotuses! Who agrees and who disagrees!” Jiang Ziyao roared as he released his sword intent.

“I agree,” Heavenly Book said.

“No opinion about that,” Qin Yun said.

“Same with me,” Mu Qianxue replied.

The six geniuses soared to the sky and released their saint radiances with constellations. The cultivators from the same forces as them also flew to the sky, and this scene made the surrounding cultivators take a deep breath. They finally knew how strong the six geniuses were after sensing the aura that they gave off.

“Kill Flower Burial first before competing for the lotuses!”

Hearing the words, everyone was terrified as they discussed amongst themselves.

“They’re going to gang up on him?”

“They have so many people, and Lin Yun’s side only has Lin Jiangxian, Ao Jue, and Xiong Tiannan.”

“The scene in the ancient battlefield appeared once more. Jiang Ziyao is really disgusting.” The cultivators outside became worried for Lin Yun.

“Venerable... this isn’t fair for Big Brother Lin...” Ji Zixi’s eyes became red. If she had a choice, she would rather stand before Lin Yun like back in the ancient battlefield, blocking them even if she had to push her bloodline to the limit. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“What is fair?” Profound Sky Venerable asked.

“One on one and elimination,” Ji Zixi said softly.

Profound Sky Venerable sighed, “You’re too young. There’s nothing fair in the world. Furthermore, don’t you think that this is perfect for Lin Yun?”

Ji Zixi was baffled upon hearing that, but Profound Sky Venerable merely smiled and said nothing.

At the same time, Lin Yun took a step forth, and smiled, “Lin Yun is here, who wants to fight me?”

He signalled Lin Jiangxian, Xiong Tinanan, and Ao Jue not to make a move as he looked around.

“Tuoba Hong will go first!” Tuoba Hong had a fiery temper as a primordial beast, and he wanted to kill Lin Yun a long time ago. He coldly said, “A mere swordsman from the barbaric realm dares to give a title to yourself? Do you really think that you’re a prodigy swordsman? I’m a Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf, and I’ll eat you today!”

Tuoba Hong was arrogant, and he didn’t conceal it.

Lin Yun smiled, “Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf? You’re just a dog that’s going to be beaten up by me today!”
