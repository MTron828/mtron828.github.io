Chapter 1741 – I'm Waiting For You!

Xiao Mingliang long noticed that Yan Tianchen had a strong foundation in mental cultivation. His mental cultivation seemed to have been tempered by blood and fire, and he knew he wouldn’t have any chance of winning against Yan Tianchen. Thus, he could only resort to using tricks.

Taking out a lute, Xiao Mingliang’s attacks were like spears raining down on Yan Tianchen. Yan Tianchen was still blowing the flute, and the crimson-armored general took a step forth and stood before him.

When the spears stabbed into the arm of the crimson-armored general, it quickly covered his arm in spikes, looking like a hedgehog. But before the spectators could exclaim, the crimson flames on the general melted the spears. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I knew that I couldn’t stop you with that!” Xiao Mingliang’s music changed, and a piece of ancient music resounded from the Nirvana Stage. With his lute, Xiao Mingliang controlled the wind and shrouded Yan Tianchen.

As the music turned to bolts of golden lightning, it flew toward Yan Tianchen from various angles while his body was like the wind, and no one could catch him.

As time passed, everyone watched as the crimson general could only take a one-sided beating. The crimson general was soon covered in holes by the lightning. A brief moment later, the crimson general finally couldn’t hold on any longer and fell onto the ground on one knee.

The holes on its body were covered in a crimson radiance that lingered in the air. But when everyone felt that Xiao Mingliang’s tactic was successful, Yan Tianchen finally made a move. Stomping his foot on the ground, the crimson light spread around the stage and swept over to him.

In the next second, a crimson tornado exploded from Yan Tianchen, along with flute music. Everything happened too quickly. Before anyone could react, the wind was forced away. The five-colored wind that surrounded him was like a pair of wings that were sliced off by the tornado around Yan Tianchen.

When the five-colored wind dissipated, Xiao Mingliang was like a broken kite falling to the ground. But Yan Tianchen didn’t end it there. The crimson general threw a punch forth, sending Xiao Mingliang flying away. The outcome of this battle also made everyone in the surroundings fall into silence.

“Yan Tianchen, pass.” The judge said, and everyone finally recovered from their shock. When they raised their heads, Yan Tianchen had already left the stage.

“Another ruthless person from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion!”

“Yan Tianchen!” A brief moment later, cheers echoed from the surroundings, and many people shouted Yan Tianchen’s name. Yan Tianchen could be considered an old-generation genius in the Heavenly Domain City, and he had already forged a reputation for himself many years ago. But because he had no stunning performances lately, everyone gradually forgot about his name. This was also why Di Qiu mocked him when they fought, saying Yan Tianchen’s time had passed.

But Yan Tianchen proved with strength that this was still his time, and music dao was never weaker than martial dao. Several rounds later, it was finally Lin Yun’s turn.

The Flying Snow Pavilion’s chief disciple Bai Yunfei, Ming Cult’s disciple Zuo Yi, and Myriad Flowers Hall’s chief disciple Fu Ya went on the Nirvana Stage. Aside from that, there were also many of Myriad Flowers Hall’s disciples.

When Lin Yun went on the stage, he could sense the surrounding hostility, and the opponents he ran into were stronger than Yan Tianchen— two chief disciples out of the Four Musical Houses and a Ming Cult’s disciple.

“Brother Qin asked me to take good care of you before coming on the stage.” Bai Yunfei smiled, and everyone surrounded Lin Yun as he spoke.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see Qin Hao coldly looking at him from down below. Turning to look at his enemies, Lin Yun felt a little agitated because his heart was in a mess right now. Seeing their gazes, his pupils gradually became cold, and he said, “Don’t be so sure about that.”

“Haha. You still dare to be so arrogant even though you’re finished? You still have a chance to give up now.” The Ming Cult’s Zuo Yi said indifferently.

The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master looked at Lin Yun. He wanted to know how Lin Yun would face this situation. He was keen, and noticed that there was something wrong with Lin Yun. It appeared that Lin Yun’s heart was chaotic.

“Go!” When the judge announced the start of the battle, Bai Yunfei, Zuo Yi, and Fu Ya charged over, playing their musical instruments. All three of them grasped the Great Saint Tone, and when their music overlapped, the Nirvana Stage was instantly turned into an ancient battlefield.

On this ancient battlefield, their music manifested into arrows that flew towards Lin Yun. When everyone else heard the music, they could only find it profound. They didn’t expect that they would cooperate so well when so many Great Saint Tones combined.

But Lin Yun had no change on his face as he took out the Thunderstorm Zither and started playing it. As a majestic sun rose behind him, multiple golden crows flew out and blocked the incoming arrows.

The surroundings of the Nirvana Stage felt as though they were in a desolate plain, and this was an ancient battlefield. On this battlefield, Lin Yun was facing an entire army. He played the Sun and Moon. The songs played by Bai Yunfei, Zuo Yi, and Fu Ya were different, but the artistic concepts in there music were similar. This was why they could manifest an ancient battlefield along with various weapons.

There were warriors riding ancient beasts and beast tamers who summoned thousands of demonic beasts, which made this ancient battlefield look realistic. They had a strong rapport, and the ancient battlefield became increasingly realistic along with their music.

Everyone’s faces changed when they saw this scene, sensing the indifference and killing intent contained in the music. But Lin Yun was like an immovable mountain facing the army with a great sun rising behind him. When the musical notes flew out from his fingers, Lin Yun’s white robe fluttered in the wind, and countless golden crows flew out from the sun, covering the battlefield with flames.

He was facing an entire army by himself, and this calmness was something that everyone sought. They couldn’t imagine the so-called “barbarian” would have such composure.

Suddenly, the stalemate began to change, and another moon rose to the sky after the sun. When the sun and moon revolved, the music played by Bai Yunfei, Zuo Yi, and Fu Ya became chaotic. This made the three surprised before their faces changed.

But Lin Yun didn’t let them go so easily. As light exploded from Lin Yun, his ten fingers sped up. His musical notes manifested into a tornado, causing cracks to start spreading on the ancient battlefield. The army summoned by the three let out a howl, and was on the verge of collapsing.

No one could compete with Lin Yun on this ancient battlefield. This made everyone’s faces change, and their pupils were filled with rage when they looked at him. Lin Yun was blazing with fury, venting it out through his music.

It didn’t take long for his music to become chaotic, but this also made the artistic concept in his music even more terrifying. When the sun descended from the sky, it instantly left the ground tattered.

When an ocean of flames appeared, many people couldn’t take it head-on, and they were sent flying away from the stage. The sun disappeared, and only a moon was hanging high in the sky.

“We admit…” The faces of Bai Yunfei, Zuo Yi, and Fu Ya changed. They didn’t hesitate to lower their musical instruments and wanted to fly off of the Nirvana Stage.

But Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t allow them to finish their words. Soaring to the sky, Lin Yun spun in mid-air, and his musical notes were like meteorites falling from the sky. They were struck by the meteorites, one after another. They were heavily injured and lost consciousness when they fell to the ground.

Looking at Bai Yunfei, Zuo Yi, and Fu Ya, everyone took a cold breath because their injuries were too severe. They couldn’t imagine that these geniuses were defeated by the hands of one person.

When Lin Yun landed on the stage, there wasn’t anyone else on it. Donned in his white robe, Lin Yun turned to look at Qin Hao and the other holy land geniuses. As Qin Hao’s face changed, Lin Yun indifferently said, “I’m waiting for you!”
