Chapter 906 - Dominance

Xian Yunzhen really knew how to pick the right moment because he got Lin Yun just as Lin Yun was about to chase after Chen Qiong. Even if Lin Yun could react swiftly, he was sure to be surprised by Xian Yunzhen’s attack.

At that time, Lin Yun would be sandwiched between Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen. However, Lin Yun turned around quickly as his punch clashed with Xian Yunzhen’s palm.

The clash caused a huge collision and Lin Yun suffered a decent loss. He could feel the turbulence within his body. Fortunately, he had brought out his sword intent or else he would have suffered more than a small loss.

“It looks like you had a decent harvest in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion. But you’re still too tender to compete with me!” Xian Yunzhen sneered.

Before Lin Yun could leave, Xian Yunzhen’s origin energy spread out from his palm in the form of black tentacles. Instantly, the tentacles reached Lin Yun and started coiling around him. The tentacles moved like they were alive as they started devouring Lin Yun’s origin energy.

Lin Yun quickly circulated his Azure Dragon Enneaform as dragon runes squirmed on the surface of his body. However, he was shocked to discover that the tentacles were also devouring his vitality. The more he struggled, the tighter he was bound.

“Haha!” Xian Yunzhen laughed sinisterly. “Lin Yun, you must’ve never seen the means of the higher realms. This is the secret technique of my Myriadlight Realm, Dragon Binding Tentacles. Even if you’re a dragon, your only fate is to be bound! Now, hand over the treasures from the Hidden Treasure Pavilion!”

Xian Yunzhen’s gaze was terrifying as violence surged within his pupils. The secret technique was his trump card that he would only use as a last resort. Since the treasures in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion were divine astral pellets, dragon clan wine, and the millennium flame, he had to retrieve them. There was no way he could let Lin Yun escape.

“Violet Purgatory Demonic Fist—Solar Sky!” After Chen Qiong recovered, his eyes flashed coldly at Lin Yun who was trapped by Xian Yunzhen. His origin energy began to surge as he circulated all of his origin energy and threw out his strongest attack.

A gigantic purple fist descended as half of Chen Qiong’s arm was wrapped in purple chains. When his fist flew towards the trapped Lin Yun, the immense pressure restricted all of space.

The cultivators in Glorysun Land sucked in a cold breath because they knew that Lin Yun was doomed. Simultaneously, they were surprised that two geniuses from the higher realms were forced this far to restrict Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun even held the upper hand when he was fighting Chen Qiong.

But now, Lin Yun was tightly bound and there was nothing he could do. Powerlessness and despair was the only outcome against geniuses from higher realms.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“The higher realm’s foundation is really envious. Even their secret techniques are comparable to an overlord fortune martial technique…” There was no change on Lin Yun’s face when he saw the fist coming at him. Even with the black tentacles wrapped around him, Lin Yun had time to reveal envy in his eyes. After all, a greater fortune martial technique couldn’t be found in the Profound Amber Realm.

Yet it was commonplace in the higher realms. When Xian Yunzhen heard that, he couldn’t help sneering, “You’re not wrong to understand it that way. You can only blame your pitiful birth and blame yourself. You shouldn’t have offended me!”

As his origin energy surged, the tentacles bound Lin Yun even more tightly. But Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with mockery. “Is that so? I’ve never had a reason to complain about my birth before. You’re too naive to think that you can trap me with just this.”

So what if his origin energy and strength was restricted by this secret technique? Lin Yun never relied on his origin energy and strength in a fight. The reason why he was fighting this way was to play with Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen. Did they really think that this was all he had?

As Lin Yun’s face became cold, a dragon roar echoed out from within his body. In the next second, his spiritual sword intent and immortal azure dragon aura merged perfectly with his sword. At the same time, the tentacles began to break into pieces as Xian Yunzhen’s face became pale while blood dripped from his lips.

Fear and disbelief filled Xian Yunzhen’s eyes. He couldn’t believe that his secret technique was so easily broken. As he panicked, he entertained thoughts about retreat.

“You think you can escape?” Lin Yun moved quickly and grabbed onto Xian Yunzhen’s wrist with hundreds of dragon runes pouring into his arm. Before Xian Yunzhen could even say a word, he was thrown by Lin Yun towards Chen Qiong.

“N-n-no!” Chen Qiong’s face changed drastically as he forcibly withdrew his attack. Just like that, Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen collided in mid-air with blood dripping down from their heads.

“How did he manage to do it?”

“Greater mastery of spiritual sword intent is already terrifying enough, but he even merged the thunderstorm intent into it…”

“No, that’s not thunderstorm intent. That’s the azure dragon sword aura! Monster…he’s a monster!” The scene of Lin Yun toying with Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen left everyone dumbfounded. Then, Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen both spit up blood as they fell to the ground.

The Dragon Binding Tentacles didn’t affect Lin Yun besides his vitality no longer feeling smooth. There was something weird about this secret technique because origin energy and vitality would strengthen the restriction of the tentacles. If one wasn’t strong enough, they would be torn into pieces. But fortunately, the sword was Lin Yun’s main means of attack.

“Damn it!” Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were fooled, so they flew into a rage and charged at Lin Yun once again. At this moment, their origin energies were surging violently in their bodies. They no longer looked down on Lin Yun.

“Great timing!” Sword intent enveloped Lin Yun’s palm as he attacked Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen.

Circulating both sword sutras, his immortal spiritual sword intent started gathering on his palm while a sword hum echoed out. The brilliant sword aura in his palm instantly tore apart the origin energy around Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen.

When a flower bloomed on Lin Yun’s palm, Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were both sent flying away. Their faces had become pale as they quickly worked together to defend against Lin Yun.

However, Lin Yun didn’t spare them and executed the Dustlight Sword Art with his fingers. The might of his attack wasn’t any inferior to when he used the Flower Burial Sword. In fact, it was a more domineering attack.

Lin Yun’s hair fluttered violently under the sword aura as his face became terrifyingly cold. Under the pressure of his sword aura, Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen couldn’t utilize their cultivation anymore. They were quickly covered in wounds and would be blown away at any moment.

“Damn it! Why is his sword intent so terrifying?!” Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were being restricted and couldn’t find a solution.

Suddenly, Lin Yun’s sword aura changed as he executed Terranean Destruction with his fingers. His attack instantly tore apart the origin energy around Chen Qiong, forcing him to his knees.

“He’s a monster!” Xian Yunzhen’s face had turned pale as he started to tremble. He was stronger than Chen Qiong, so he took the opportunity of Lin Yun suppressing Chen Qiong to break free from the restriction of Lin Yun’s sword aura.

“Brother Chen, I’m sorry that I have to let you down. I’ll get revenge for you in the future.” With a flash, Xian Yunzhen fled for his life. He didn’t dare to stay for a single moment.

“Bastard!” Chen Qiong started cursing when he saw this scene.

Chen Qiong had realized that Lin Yu was just as terrifying as the likes of Feng Wuji. Perhaps only Chen Qiong’s senior brother from the Myriadlight Realm could suppress Lin Yun. Xian Yunzhen didn’t even bother to glance at Chen Qiong and started planning his revenge as he escaped.

Suddenly, Lil’ Red appeared with a grin and stabbed its dagger at Xian Yunchen’s chest. Xian Yunchen was caught by surprise as blood gushed out of his chest. Standing back up and clutching his chest, Xian Yunchen prepared to move. Suddenly, he sensed a cold aura enveloping him. Raising his head, his locked eyes with Lin Yun.

“I advise you to be obedient. Don’t force me to draw my sword.” Lin Yun’s eerie voice made Xian Yunzhen feel as though a bucket of ice water had been poured on him. At this moment, he no longer dared to move.
