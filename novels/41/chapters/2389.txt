Chapter 2390 - Yue Weiwei's Dance

Lin Jiangxian turned around and left. She was like a sharp sword as she came over to Lin Yun’s side. This battle made her famous.

Very quickly, many people heard of her origins and felt unbelievable that the branch of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion would produce such a genius. One must know that many people had high hopes for Di Feng, but he became Lin Jiangxian’s stepping stone.

“She’s the true prodigy swordsman!”

“I heard Flower Burial was a prodigy swordsman, but it looks like they recognized the wrong person.”

“How is that possible? I heard Lin Jiangxian didn’t move during the ninth testing ground and gave Flower Burial a chance to shine.”

“Let me see how strong that Flower Burial is!” Lin Jiangxian’s performance made many people discuss the ninth testing ground. When they discussed the ninth testing ground, Lin Yun was naturally someone who couldn’t be avoided. After all, he dealt with the Heavenly Sword Pavilion, Dao Sect, and Shadow Divine Palace by himself and left five spots empty.

But no one had seen Lin Yun fight before, so many people began to doubt him.

Xi Yuan was deeply shocked as she watched Lin Jiangxian coming over. She was the one responsible for receiving Lin Yun’s group, so she wasn’t bothered by them initially, but she was shocked now.

“Your sword was so fast that even I couldn’t keep up with it,” Lin Yun said, looking at Lin Jiangxian.

“That means you've managed to keep up with it,” Lin Jiangxian said.

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled as he was praising Lin Jiangxian.

On the other hand, everyone’s faces became ugly on Di Feng’s side when he returned. They wanted to take revenge for Tuoba Hong, but they didn’t expect that they would fail.

The subsequent few battles were breathtaking, and the atmosphere became heated when Dugu Jue, from the first testing ground, swept the stage with his Sovereign Constellation. Dugu Jue was a ruthless person from the first testing ground, and it was no secret that he grasped a Sovereign Constellation. But they were shocked after witnessing it with their own eyes.

Lin Yun fell into deep thought. Since a Sovereign Constellation baptised his Divine Dragon Physique, he could summon the Azure Dragon Constellation. Could that also be treated as a Sovereign Constellation? If that was considered a Sovereign Constellation, then he had grasped two Sovereign Constellations.

While he was pondering, Ji Zixi’s name was called out and she went on the stage, causing an uproar. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Where did this beauty come from? She’s not inferior to Xia Qingyun.”

“She’s also from the ninth testing ground, and Lin Yun brought her over.”

“So she’s a vase... What a pity...” Everyone’s gazes became playful when they learned about Ji Zixi’s background.

Ji Zixi’s smile disappeared. She would be furious upon hearing that, even if she had a good temper. When the fight began, Ji Zixi didn’t hide her strength and immediately used her bloodline as the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden. A pair of rainbow wings that appeared behind her made her look noble and dignified, leaving everyone stumped and they couldn’t shift their gaze from her.

“She’s so beautiful? Why didn’t I realize it before?” Lin Yun muttered to himself.

“Big Brother Lin, do you like what you see?” Yue Weiwei smiled.

“She’s going to make a move,” Lin Yun changed the topic.

After Ji Zixi released her bloodline, not only did her temperament change, but her strength as well. She gave off a powerful phoenix aura, and she would leave ripples in the surrounding space whenever she flapped her wings. This made her look blurred, and Lin Yun was shocked.

Ever since they came to the Heavenly Barren Realm, Lin Yun realized he could sense an ancient power coming from Ji Zixi, allowing her cultivation to progress rapidly. Even after she gave most of the resources to him, her cultivation speed was still faster than his, so there was no question that Ji Zixi made it through this round.

When everyone saw how Ji Zixi returned to Lin Yun’s table like Lin Jiangxian, an uproar broke out.

“Something isn’t right. Aren’t there too many beauties around Lin Yun?”

“It’s true, now that you mentioned it.” Many soon noticed that something wasn’t right. Ji Zixi and Yue Weiwei were peerless beauties, a Heavenly Phoenix Maiden and a Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden. Lin Jiangxian wasn’t bad either, since she had a heroic temperament that added to her beauty, and yet the three of them revolved around Lin Yun.

“Can he even take it...?”

“What did he do? He’s nothing aside from being handsome.” Jealousy soon aroused everyone’s unhappiness against Lin Yun.

Listening to the surrounding discussions, Lin Jiangxian smiled, “Flower Burial, you have become the public enemy.”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled since he was already keeping a low profile.

“You must be careful later because many people might come after you,” Lin Jiangxian smiled.

Xi Yuan’s eyes shone with splendor when she looked at Lin Jiangxian. She was shocked by Lin Yun’s outstanding appearance when they first met, but she now sensed that he was exuding boundless charm as they interacted.

Xiong Tiannan poured, “Why didn’t anyone scold me? My biggest dream is to be scolded by others, saying I’m nothing aside from looking handsome.”

Everyone around him smiled when they heard what Xiong Tiannan said.

Ao Jue was speechless, before he smiled, “Others are targeted because they’re too strong, but Brother Lin is targeted because he's too handsome.”

Lin Yun helplessly smiled because that was true. What Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue said wasn’t false, and he could sense the surrounding hostile gazes when Lin Jiangxian and Ji Zixi shone brightly on the stage, such as the one coming from the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, whose attention was on him the entire time.

Whenever Yue Weiwei talked to Lin Yun, the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son felt as though he was being stabbed in his chest.

When Lin Yun’s name was called out, Yue Weiwei’s name was also called out and they went to the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage together. As they smiled, an uproar exploded from the surroundings.

“So the legend is true!”

“The Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden was waiting for Flower Burial!’

“What gives?!”

Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei looked intimate as they went on the stage. When the two held hands together, it shattered everyone’s dream that they were just friends. Before the fight, the remaining ninety-eight people’s gazes already fell on Lin Yun with hostility. Everyone was looking forward to giving Lin Yun a beating later.

“Flower Burial? His reputation is probably fake.”

“He’s only relying on women. If not for the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden, who would pay attention to him?”

“He will be exposed later!”

“Trample on him!”

Discussions resounded from the surroundings that made Xiong Tiannan, Ji Zixi, Ao Jue, and Lin Jiangxian nervous because what Lin Jiangxian said earlier came true. Lin Yun became the target of everyone.

Standing on the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage, Lin Yun looked around, and smiled, “What dense murderous intent. How terrifying.”

The judge was Profound Sky Venerable, who sneered in disdain upon hearing what Lin Yun said. If he were younger, even he would want to give Lin Yun a beating.

But Yue Weiwei suddenly turned around and smiled, “Big Brother Lin, can you let me handle them?”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned upon hearing that, before Yue Weiwei continued, “Big Brother Lin suffered so much, so it’s time for you to take a rest.”

“The murderous intent directed at me will only become stronger if you do this,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hehe. Weiwei wants to make everyone envious of Big Brother Lin, and I want Big Brother Lin to feel like the most blissful person in the world,” Yue Weiwei smiled. As she spoke, she got close and kissed Lin Yun on his lips.

“Let the battle begin!” Profound Sky Venerable couldn’t hold it any longer and announced the beginning of the fight, and the resentment in this battle was much stronger than in the past.

The other ninety-eight competitors were dumbfounded. When they came to their senses, rage blazed in their hearts as they summoned their constellations, releasing powerful auras that made the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage tremble.

“Holy shit!” Xiong Tiannan exclaimed. He had never seen everyone so united before. Everyone watching this fight was also shocked, but they soon calmed down because no one could endure it. Not only did Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei hold hands, but they even kissed on the stage before their eyes. Who knew how many men had their hearts shattered because of that?

“You’re not allowed to move.” Yue Weiwei winked, before she turned around to face the ninety-eight people. When she turned around, she wore a charming smile that made everyone’s hearts tremble. As ribbons flew around her, the ribbons bloomed like flowers, pushing back everyone in a split second.

She began to dance around Lin Yun, and no one could approach him. This left everyone dumbfounded, and the ninety-eight people were furious. This was ridiculous. Not only did those two show their love in public, but the goddess in their hearts came around to attack them.

“She’s gorgeous!” Everyone commented after they recovered from their shock.

When Yue Weiwei danced, she looked like a fairy, and everyone couldn’t help becoming even more jealous of Lin Yun upon thinking about it.

Lin Yun was also dumbfounded before he smiled and took out the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, playing the Ni Chang Dress Song. As he blew, snowflakes descended from the sky, which pulled everyone into his music.

Threads also descended from the sky, forming a dress and enveloping Yue Weiwei. As Yue Weiwei danced, she turned around and gave Lin Yun a smile with her hair fluttering amongst the snowflakes. Under the music, Yue Weiwie became even more bewitching, but she was also ruthless in her attacks, which was unfortunate for the ninety-eight people.
