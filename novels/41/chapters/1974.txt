Chapter 1975 - Remorse Cliff

This scene had shocked everyone immensely, and none of them had come to their senses from the shock yet.

Bai Shuying’s face changed. But looking at Ye Qingtian from afar, she discovered that he was alive and didn’t seem heavily injured. This made Bai Shuying heave a sigh in relief, and her gaze became complicated when she looked at Ye Qingtian again. Ye Qingtian didn’t seem to be a lecher like what was rumored, and he could be considered a good person. So she had a feeling that Ye Qingtian had other motives.

“Ye Qingtian, hasn’t changed despite being punished. He’s intruded the forbidden ground and committed blasphemy against the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden. He will be confined in Remorse Cliff, and his punishment will be determined after the Dragon Origin Great Saint returns,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s voice resounded.

Everyone was surprised when they heard that, and the faces of those at the Quasi-Saint Realm couldn’t help becoming weird. Remorse Cliff was where one had remorse for what they did, and there wasn’t any actual punishment. There were even possibilities of one coming out from it ahead in advance.

Generally speaking, those who weren’t hardworking in their cultivation, were involved in a private scuffle, or failed to complete their mission would be sent to Remorse Cliff for confinement. According to what Ye Qingtian did, no one would find it inappropriate even if the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint sentenced Ye Qingtian to death. At the very least, he should be placed on the Heavenly Punishment Stage to undergo the torture of elements.

So what the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint did was no different from slapping Ye Qingtian’s palm with a ruler. She might seem to have punished Ye Qingtian, but she went easy on him. After all, that palm she released was terrifying, and they wouldn’t be surprised if Ye Qingtian was blown to bits.

“Golden Guard Bai Xiao,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“I’m here.” Bai Xiao stepped forth and cupped his hands together.

“You’ll be responsible for watching over Ye Qingtian. Take him away from Nether Orchid Mountain, immediately.”

“Roger!” Despite the doubts on Bai Xiao’s face, he was inwardly relieved because this was the best outcome. After receiving the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s orders, Bai Xiao grabbed Lin Yun and his sword box and headed to Remorse Cliff.

“Shuying, you come with me. As for everyone else, you guys can disperse.” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint summoned Bai Shuying and headed to the Solar Jade Palace.

The other Quasi-Saints exchanged glances, and their pupils were confused.

“That scared me. I thought Ye Qingtian was really going to be killed.”

“This is the best outcome. Otherwise, there would be a conflict between two Great Saints when the Dragon Origin Great Saint returns.”

“But Ye Qingtian hasn’t changed at all!”

“He’s born with a fortunate life. He had the Azure River Sword Saint asking for mercy before, and he became the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s secluded disciple this time.” The Quasi-Saints discussed amongst themselves as they left.

But no one noticed that there was another person in the Celestial Pool. This person was the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, Wan Muyan. She took an opportunity during the chaos and entered the Celestial Pool, arriving to where the battle took place between Ye Qingtian and Bai Shuying earlier. After checking the pool, Wang Muyan finally realized what was happening with the Solar Lunar Divine Rune.

“I see… It’s no wonder why I can sense the Solar Lunar Divine Rune’s aura but haven't been able to find it.” A smile rose on Wang Muyan’s lips as she muttered, “That lass is too tender to compete with me.”

But her smile soon became weird because she could sense that Ye Qingtian wasn’t simple. She continued, “Don’t tell me something happened between Ye Qingtian and Bai Shuying at the bottom of the pool…”

When the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Bai Shuying returned to the Solar Jade Palace, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked, “Shuying, you look like you have something to say. Can it be that there’s another story to tonight’s matters?”

“I do have some speculations,” Bai Shuying replied.

“Go on.”

“Ye Qingtian is a lecher, and he must have an objective in entering the Celestial Pool. He might also be someone else,” Bai Shuying shared her speculation.

“What is he after?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint already knew of Ye Qingtian’s true identity, so she wasn’t surprised.

“It might be the Solar Lunar Divine Rune,” Bai Shuying said.

“The Solar Lunar Divine Rune? That’s impossible… He doesn’t need the Solar Lunar Divine Rune…” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s face changed, and she soon rejected it. She found the Solar Lunar Divine Rune with the Radiant Sword Saint. If the Radiant Sword Saint really needed it, he wouldn’t let her have it back then.

Even if he changed his mind… No, it isn’t like him to change his mind, nor would he send his disciple to steal the Solar Lunar Divine Rune from the Nether Orchid Courtyard. That isn’t something Jian Wuming would do.

Bai Shuying was inwardly surprised, so she softly asked, “Master, do you know something?”

“I will handle this matter. He’s definitely not here for the Solar Lunar Divine Rune,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

From the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s words, Bai Shuying instantly realized that there was a story behind Ye Qingtian’s actions, and she couldn’t help becoming furious. She couldn’t figure out how Ye Qingtian knew how to hide so well. He said he loved her but had so many hidden secrets.

“What else did he do within the Celestial Pool? Tell me if you suffered any grievances, and I’ll punish him for you,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

Bai Shuying knew that if she told her master what really happened, her master definitely wouldn’t let Ye Qingtian off so easily. Thus, she took a deep breath and said, “Nothing happened. I noticed him when he entered the Celestial Pool, and he can do nothing to me with his strength.”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint fell into a long silence before she said, “Shuying, you can’t fall in love with someone like him.”

Bai Shuying’s heart panicked when she heard that, and she immediately refuted, “How can I possibly fall for a lecher like him? Furthermore, my heart already belongs to someone else.”

As Bai Shuying said, her expression became gentle, and she instantly tossed what happened today to the back of her mind. She even revealed a smile on her lips.

“Who’s this person? I’ve heard you mention him, but he’s still nowhere to be seen after two years,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“He will be here. This is our agreement. Master has also heard of this person, but I can’t tell you about it now. Master will naturally know who he is when he comes,” Bai Shuying smiled, but her gaze was firm. She believed in that person. Since he said he would come, he would definitely come no matter what.

Looking at Bai Shuying’s expression, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint couldn’t help smiling and said, “Alright. You’re alarmed tonight, so rest in the Solar Jade Palace today.”

“Thank you, Master.” Bai Shuying naturally agreed to it.

After that night, the entire Heavenly Dao Sect exploded because the news of Ye Qingtian intruding into the Celestial Pool was spread throughout the sect once more. They could only say that Ye Qingtian was too cocky, not to mention the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden caught him.

No one had any idea why Ye Qingtian intruded on the Celestial Pool when he had such a bright future. He was the champion of Di Group and the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s secluded disciple. Ye Qingtian’s name had long spread through the Eastern Desolation, and the other holy lands knew there was a talented swordsman within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Then again, they could also understand him. After all, it was already shocking when he first intruded on the Celestial Pool. So they weren’t surprised that he would intrude again, especially since he had become even cockier than a year ago. They could only say that it was as expected of Ye Qingtian.

Some said that Ye Qingtian was dead, and his corpse was hung on Remorse Cliff. They claimed they sensed the powerful aura the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint released last night, and not even an ordinary Saint could survive her attack.

Some said that Ye Qingtian wasn’t dead, but he was heavily injured with his cultivation crippled. There were various stories, but no one doubted the story of Ye Qingtian intruding on the Celestial Pool.

When Wang Yue, Ouyang He, Chen Zhong, and Yuan Chen heard of what Ye Qingtian did, their jaws dropped. They pondered for seven days and seven nights, searching the entire Heavenly Dao Sect for Ye Qingtian, but he was actually in the Celestial Pool.

A long while later, Chen Zhong smiled, “As expected of Ye Qingtian. It’s no wonder why we couldn’t find him anywhere.”

Wang Yue wore an awkward expression. He was initially worried about Ye Qingtian’s safety, but he never expected that Ye Qingtian would be ‘sick’ again.

“There must be a story behind this matter. After all, why would he be confined in Remorse Cliff if it was something severe?” Ouyang He said.

“In my opinion, Senior Brother Ye has already changed, and the matter between him and the holy maiden might be more complicated than we expect,” Yuan Chen said softly.

“I also share the same view, but many Quasi-Saints witnessed him intruding on the Celestial Pool,” Wang Yue said. He then raised his head and saw a gloating expression on the faces of Xiao Jingyan, Ye Qinghong, Bai Yizhou, and Zhang Kui.

They were discussing that Ye Qingtian was already dead, which made Wang Yue frown unhappily. After all, Ye Qingtian was better than them, no matter what others said, so he decided to ask Ye Qingtian about it at Remorse Cliff.

In the Profound Maiden Courtyard, when the Serene Dust Great Saint learned of this matter, she was furious, “How could Wuming’s disciple do something like that? Bai Ziyuan is too much!”

“Who’s Wuming?” Xin Yan asked.

The Serene Dust Great Saint instantly became speechless. She already knew about Lin Yun’s true identity from the Dragon Origin Great Saint and had been thinking of a way to fetch him. Since Lin Yun was the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, he could also be considered her disciple. Since Jian Wuming got him to come to the Heavenly Dao Sect, he must’ve wanted her to take care of Lin Yun.

Lin Yun would only suffer if he went to Bai Ziyuan, and this was what she had been concerned about. But what she heard today made her lose her temper because she couldn’t believe the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple would do something like this. She believed that Bai Ziyuan must’ve framed him.

The Serene Dust Great Saint looked at Xin Yan and said, “You don’t have to ask about it. Ye Qingtian is definitely innocent, or he would be on the Heavenly Punishment Stage by now. Being confined to Remorse Cliff means Bai Ziyuan feels guilty.”

The Serene Dust Great Saint donned a blue robe with a pair of shining bright eyes. She was still a peerless beauty, even if she was proficient in Buddhism Dao.

Xin Yan said, “But it is a fact that he intruded on the Celestial Pool. Many Quasi-Saints can attest to it.”

“It might be true that he intruded the Celestial Pool, but he can’t commit blasphemy against the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden,” the Serene Dust Great Saint snorted. “That lass looks as ordinary as her master. So why would Ye Qingtian commit blasphemy against her?”

Xin Yan widened her pupils and did her best to endure her laughter. Her master had a good temper, aside from being overprotective of her, but she would look down on everything related to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

“If she really sent Ye Qingtian to the Heavenly Punishment Stage, I’d have to save him no matter what.” The Serene Dust Great Saint frowned, “But he’s confined to Remorse Cliff, and I’m unable to save him. Bai Ziyuan is still as scheming and shrewd as before.”

The Serene Dust Great Saint took out a jade bottle and turned to look at Xin Yan. She said, “There’s a Saint Dragon Pellet within it. Deliver this to him, regardless if he’s injured.”

Xin Yan was surprised to hear what her master said, but she still received the Saint Dragon Pellet.

When Lin Yun woke up, it was already noon. He found himself on an abyssal cliff with a cave behind him. This instantly puzzled him about where he was because he should be on the Heavenly Punishment Stage.

When he examined his injuries, he discovered that not only was he not injured by the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, the latter had even left saint aura within his body. On the contrary, he recovered from all the injuries he suffered from Bai Shuying, and he was surprised that it worked for him to call the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint ‘Mistress.’

“Ye Qingtian, you’re awake?” Bai Xiao appeared before Lin Yun, looking at him with a playful gaze.

“Big Brother Bai, where am I?” Lin Yun asked.

“Read for yourself.” Bai Xiao pointed in a direction.

When Lin Yun looked in that direction, Bai Xiao pointed to a stone tablet. He recited the name on the tablet, “Remorse Cliff.”

Lin Yun was stunned when he read it. But looking at the tablet, Lin Yun couldn’t help recalling the past. When he raised his head, he saw a figure walking over. This figure was graceful and elegant. This was Xin Yan.

She seemed to have come out from his memories, and her smile was still the same. She was the Profound Maiden, the direct disciple of the Serene Dust Great Saint, and part of the golden generation within the Heavenly Dao Sect. But in Lin Yun’s heart, she would always be that senior sister who brought him and Li Wuyou to the Great Qin Empire, Xin Yan of the Firmament Sword Pavilion.
