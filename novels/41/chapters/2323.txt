Chapter 2324 - Unlucky

According to Wu Yuhua, the fortune was graded into different levels. White was the lowest while gold was the highest. Golden fortune could allow one to comprehend Sovereign Daos, meaning Lin Yun could strengthen his Sword Dao. This was an opportunity that Lin Yun only dreamt of.

The golden fortune was as large as a disk, and he could faintly see a grand world within it with countless sword rays intertwining as though thousands of sword immortals were soaring to the sky.

Ji Zixi gently reached out and touched it, and a ringing bell could be heard along with a sword vibration. She felt that her soul was being cleansed. even if she wasn’t a swordsman. Sword intent was like flames tempering her saint soul and blood. When she opened her eyes, her eyes shone brightly with a phoenix appearing behind her that was connected to multiple worlds.

This made Lin Yun dazed since he couldn’t fathom what kind of existence the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden was, but Lin Yun restrained himself from asking any questions.

“It’s really magical,” Ji Zixi looked at Lin Yun. She continued, “Big Brother Lin, this fortune contains pure sword intent, and I received a huge benefit even though I’m not a swordsman.”

In a nutshell., she was implying that Lin Yun would benefit even more as a swordsman.

Lin Yun smiled at the golden fortune because he was here to improve his Sovereign Dao, and he could finally fulfill his wish. He smiled, “You look even more excited than me.”

Ji Zixi said, “That’s for sure. You didn’t see the smug look on Xiong Tiannan’s face earlier. He said the sword was a scrap of iron, but it contained a golden fortune. So how can I not be happy about it?”

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling when he looked at Ji Zixi. She was only seventeen or eighteen, still in a time of innocence and joy.

“Big Brother Lin, we should change our location since the golden fortune might’ve created a huge uproar,” Ji Zixi suggested.

"There's no need," Lin Yun shook his head. He carefully chose this valley. It was secluded, quiet, and an excellent location. The valley had strong winds, with the clouds concealing this valley. Even if there were significant disturbances, they would be difficult to detect outside.

“Alright, let me help you inscribe the Metal Divine Rune while you refine the golden fortune,” Ji Zixi suggested with excitement and anticipation. Inscribing a divine rune would exhaust vitality, not to mention that the Metal Divine Rune had to be further refined, unlike her Phoenix Divine Rune that was naturally born.

This made Lin Yun feel heartache, but he said nothing after looking at her. He smiled, “Okay.”

“You can just leave it to me, Big Brother Lin. When you finish refining the golden fortune, you can just drip your blood on it for it to acknowledge you,” Ji Zixi said enthusiastically. In no time, they began their respective tasks, Lin Yun was refining the golden fortune while Ji Zixi inscribed the Metal Divine Rune on the ribbons. Her eyes were shining brightly as she examined the golden bamboo slip.

Half a month later, Lin Yun was done refining the golden fortune with the saint dao of his Sword Dao growing from a few hundred to five to six thousand. This harvest was unimaginable in the outside world.

The two sword stars in his sword sea became even more realistic, looking like an actual moon and sun. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, a light flashed across his eyes with his bottleneck loosening up, showing signs of reaching the Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent.

“That’s great!” Lin Yun rejoiced. He was now prepared and just had to wait for the Sovereign Monument. If he was lucky, his sword intent might take another step further.

He lacked in foundation when compared to geniuses on the Brandished Dragon Ranking, but his sword technique and comprehension of sword intent far exceeded those geniuses. When a dazzling radiance suddenly shone, Lin Yun raised his head, “Mhm?”

Three thousand ribbons fluttered as Ji Zixi held a brush in her hand and a dish in the other hand. She was swift and graceful, soaring around as she inscribed the Metal Divine Rune and her exquisite figure couldn’t be concealed. Her brush was unusual. It was shrouded in radiance, allowing her to easily inscribe divine runes.

“Big Brother Lin, you’re awake!” Ji Zixi sensed Lin Yun’s gaze and rushed over with excitement. She chuckled, “I’m also done. I just need to make some minor adjustments for perfection.”

“You’ve been drawing for half a month?” Lin Yun was surprised.

“Yeah,” Ji Zixi smiled. “Impressive, right?”

Lin Yun was amazed. But he soon noticed that the ink she used was her blood. He asked, “This is…”

“Phoenix Saint Blood. The golden sparkles are Dragon Blood Metal. They might be rare, but I have quite a bit of them,” Ji Zixi smiled. She shook the brush in her hand, and smiled, “It’s all thanks to this brush. I don’t remember which senior gave this to me, but it’s handy.”

When Lin Yun heard what she said, he couldn’t help being dazed. Lin Yun naturally knew how bitter it felt. A long time later, he said, “You have a lot of treasures.”

“I’ve been doted on by everyone since I was young. Everyone in the outside world called me the little princess of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, but even a phoenix might not receive my treatment,” Ji Zixi smiled. As she spoke, she took a deep breath, showing a hint of maturity that didn’t belong to her age. She smiled, “Big Brother Lin, let’s not talk about that and give it a try. I spent half a month inscribing them for you.”

When Lin Yun looked at the ribbons, he was shocked because he couldn’t do a better job than Ji Zixi. Even if it was thanks to the golden bamboo slip, he had to admit that Ji Zixi was really talented. He said, “Very impressive.”

“Hehe, that’s for sure. I’m an unprecedented talent of the Divine Phoenix Mountain in the past thousand years,” Ji Zixi received the praise with delight and smiled charmingly.

Lin Yun smiled and refined the ribbons with his saint blood, the same as making a saint artifact recognizing you as its master. Three thousand ribbons entered Lin Yun’s body a few minutes later.

Seeing this, Ji Zixi was satisfied that she could help Lin Yun.

Suddenly, a commotion resounded that broke the silence of the valley. When Lin Yun and Ji Zixi turned around, they saw someone above the valley as a meteorite descended. This person was none other than Xiong Tiannan. He still carried the coffin and cauldron, but it was different this time, leaving Lin Yun and Ji Zixi slightly surprised.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

His coffin had increased from one to ten and he was carrying them together like lifting a mountain. He wasn’t surprised when he saw Lin Yun and chuckled, “Hehe, you’re also here? It looks like great minds think alike!”

With a loud thud, he dropped the coffins on the ground with a smug look on his face.

“Big Brother Lin is a great mind, but you’re not,” Ji Zixi retorted.

“How am I not?” Xiong Tiannan chuckled.

“You spoke badly of Big Brother Lin in the underground palace, and you even wanted to snatch Big Brother Lin’s treasure,” Ji Zixi said seriously.

Xiong Tiannan laughed, “Treasure? Do you mean that ancient sword? I already knew that it was a scrap of iron.”

Ji Zixi became furious upon hearing that, but she didn’t refute and looked at Lin Yun. When she saw Lin Yun nodding, she smiled, “Who told you that it’s scrap iron? The ancient sword contained golden fortune inside!”

“Golden fortune? You really know how to boast,” Xiong Tiannan said with disdain. But his face briefly changed, and he said, looking around, “Holy shit, there’s an aura of golden fortune lingering around. Brother, you obtained a golden fortune?”

Lin Yun smiled and nodded.

“Congratulations. I’ve come to the right place to brush some of your fortune. Haha! Look how I’ll open the ten coffins and get a golden legend!” Xiong Tiannan was excited as he placed the cauldron on the ground. But he turned to Lin Yun and said, “Hehe, wait for me.”

He left behind the dumbfounded Lin Yun and Ji Zixi before returning with a purple daoist robe, which made him look dignified.

Lin Yun asked, “What are you doing?”

“Bathing and changing my clothes? I must be a little serious since I’m opening mystery boxes, since they require some ceremony. You won’t understand it,” Xiong Tiannan said. His eyes flashed with excitement and uneasiness as Lin Yun and Ji Zixi took a few steps back. Xiong Tiannan’s current state was a little weird.

“Let’s take a breath of the purple qi.” Xiong Tiannan took a deep breath towards the sun before coming before the ten coffins with a dignified and nervous expression.

The atmosphere was tense but Lin Yun and Ji Zixi said nothing upon seeing this. Ji Zixi softly asked, “Big Brother Lin, what is he doing?”

Lin Yun merely shook his head, having no idea what Xiong Tiannan was doing.

“Golden legend!” Under the nervous atmosphere, Xiong Tiannan roared and waved his hands. When the ten coffins opened, they produced a massive uproar with black smoke coming out from them. This was a terrifying phenomenon, but no golden light could be seen.

When all ten coffins were opened, there wasn’t any golden light. But the coffins had a light flickering inside with something. This made Xiong Tiannan’s face ugly.
