Chapter 1956 - Breakthrough to the Nirvana Stage!

The full moon hung high in the night as Lin Yun sat beside Ye Guhan, looking at the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf performing an ancient ritual with the other demonic wolves down the mountain.

“Alright, stop being angry. Come, have a fruit.” Ye Guhan smiled and took out a fruit, wiping it before handing it to Lin Yun.

Lin Yun didn’t say anything along the way, but his teeth were gritted. He took the fruit and cautiously asked, “There isn’t anything weird with this, right?”

Once bitten, twice shy. He was afraid that there might be a scheme and wasn’t in a hurry to take a bite of the fruit.

Ye Guhan smiled, “This is the Divine Dragon Fruit. They’re peaches grown in the Divine Dragon Empire’s garden, and I take some every few years.”

“That’s stealing.” Lin Yun was relieved after hearing that and started chewing on the fruit.

“Hehe.” Ye Guhan corrected, “It taken, not stolen. How can something done by a Saint Sovereign be called steal? Furthermore, these fruits are only a little sweeter.”

“It’s not a saint fruit?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

“How can there be so many saint fruits? It’s just an ordinary spiritual fruit. A saint fruit has to be over a thousand years, at the very least,” Ye Guhan explained. He then handed the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella back to Lin Yun.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

When Lin Yun took a bite of the fruit, he realized that it really was just a spiritual fruit and there was nothing special about it. But it was sweet, and he wouldn’t get tired of it. As he ate, his expression gradually eased up. He even peeked at his senior brother, whose smile was probably related to the Divine Dragon Fruit.

“Senior Brother, would I have been able to kill that monarch demonic beast if I went all out back then?” Lin Yun asked, stowing the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

“Most likely. After all, he already took two heavy blows, and he might not be able to bear it again,” Ye Guhan explained. “Not to mention it had just reached the Quasi-Saint Realm, and it didn’t have any inheritance in its bloodline. So its method of using the saint aura was crude.”

“Inheritance in its bloodline?” Lin Yun’s pupils flashed with doubt.

Ye Guhan looked at the distant Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf and said, “These wild demonic beasts are pitiful, more pitiful than wandering human cultivators. After all, wandering cultivators can still buy cultivation techniques. As for these demonic beasts who didn’t retreat to the Heavenly Demon Continent, it’s hard for them to obtain a genuine cultivation technique.”

“There’s something like that?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

“The Heavenly Demons were the strongest batch of holy beasts in the Kunlun Realm three thousand years ago. But they’re nonexistent now…” Ye Guhan continued, “But three thousand years have passed, and the Heavenly Demon Continent has developed. They’re now the greatest threat to the Divine Dragon Empire.”

Right then, the wolf pack let out a roar in the direction of the full moon. Lin Yun quickly lowered his head and saw a crude altar at the bottom, and many demonic wolves slit their wrists and used their blood to draw runes.

“What ritual are they holding?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“Most likely a ritual for the Wolf God or some other deity of the Wolf Clan.”

“How is that possible? Aren’t the gods already gone?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

“You’re belittling deities. It’s hard to genuinely kill a deity, and the traces they left behind will remain even if they’re dead. Their bloodline descendants will remember their names,” Ye Guhan said with a profound smile. “This ancient ritual is to awaken the memories in their bloodline, which can be the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf’s inheritance, even if they’re only fragments.”

As Ye Guhan spoke, he looked at Lin Yun with a smile, “At that time, it won’t be bullied by your sword technique anymore.”

Lin Yun merely smiled awkwardly and asked, “So what if they still remember the deities? Can the deities revive?”

“Logically, no. But as long as the number of people remembering them increases, the traces they’ve left behind in this world will respond. As time passes this way, they might possibly revive…” Ye Guhan smiled, “Then again, it’s not easy, and the Divine Realm is too distant. My words aren’t exactly true either, and they won’t be at their full strength, even if they come to life.”

Lin Yun quietly listened and chatted with Ye Guhan, learning about the ancient secrets. When they finished all the Divine Dragon Fruits, Ye Guhan clapped his hands and said, “Time for me to teach you the seal of the Azure Dragon Sword Heart. I’ll start with the Myriad Astral Seal first.”

When Ye Guhan formed a seal, his sword heart began to tremble while absorbing all the surrounding spiritual energy. He was like a whale devouring the boundless spiritual energy.

“This is the Myriad Astral Seal,” Ye Guhane explained. “You can use this technique to enter the soul and sword united state, and you will also greatly boost your cultivation.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thought because he could sense that before, but he wasn’t systematically trained in it. After he tried it several times, he easily succeeded.

“Isn’t it simple?” Ye Guhan smiled.

When Lin Yun wanted to say something, he immediately figured it out. His senior brother wanted him to comprehend it by fighting with a Quasi-Saint before guiding him. This way, it would be easier for him to cultivate. If he didn’t experience the fight with the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf, it would probably take a long time for him to comprehend it.

“This is the Flying Celestial Seal!” Ye Guhan formed a seal and continued, “This was your last attack against the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf, unleashing the power of your sword heart. But your methods were too crude and exhausted all of your dragon origin and vitality. You succeeded in wounding the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf but also became helpless.”

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled because he collapsed on the ground after executing it. On the contrary, the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf still had a breath left and nearly took his life.

“The Flying Celestial Seal will help you gather the energy. At the very least, you won’t be powerless after unleashing it…” Ye Guhan continued, “This is the most horrifying means of a swordsman, especially after you grasp the Sword Domain in the future. Upon executing it, even someone one realm above you will be terrified.”

Lin Yun smiled because this was a powerful trump card. Upon grasping it, it was equivalent to having a powerful trump card that was entirely his own.

“What’s the difference between a swordsman’s Sword Domain and another cultivator’s domain?” Lin Yun asked.

“They’re not the same,” Ye Guhan said. “A swordsman’s Sword Domain defies heaven while other cultivators’ domains oblige the way of heaven. The former is more ferocious, domineering, and they’re also easier to snap.”

The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf roared right then, sensing Lin Yun and Ye Guhan’s Flying Celestial Seal. This instantly made the wolf uneasy as it looked over, and the ritual was also paused.

“Looks like we’ve scared it. Let’s stop for now. Take the opportunity to reach the Nirvana Stage when the ritual begins,” Ye Guhan smiled. He naturally noticed Lin Yun’s deep foundation, and it was hard for Lin Yun to break into the Nirvana Stage. So Lin Yun would need a long time if he had no opportunities.

When the ritual began, a white pillar of light shot to the sky from the altar, basking a hundred-mile radius in a silver radiance. All the demonic beasts collapsed on the ground in respect, and the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf sat on the altar.

When the silver radiance swept over Lin Yun, he was shocked to discover that his vitality was ignited. The essence of the Blood Rune Fruit he ate was gushing out of his acupuncture points, as if it was being attracted by a certain holy energy.

As flames enveloped Lin Yun the next moment, his profound life and death auras flowed out of the channels and gathered in his violet palace. Under the flames, the profound life aura, profound death aura, and dragon origin began to merge and transform.

This naturally brought joy to Lin Yun’s face, and he raised his head to look at Ye Guhan, “Senior Brother…”

“Didn’t I just say I’m filled with love for you?” Ye Guhan wore a gentle smile.
