Chapter 1195 - Who Can Fight Me?

As Lin Yun swiftly retreated, he realized that he couldn’t break free no matter what. The faster he retreated, the more harm he would suffer from the sword aura. His sword aura had basically become a catalyst for Gongsun Yan’s attack.

By the time Lin Yun discovered it, the dragon that trapped him was practically complete. He no longer had a path of retreat. Looking at this scene, Gongsun Yan smiled, “Brother Lin, there’s no need to feel afraid because I've long reached the manifestation stage in this sword. I can control this attack as I wish. Don’t worry, I won’t take your life. However, you will have to lie in bed for at least half a month.”

Many people nodded their heads when they saw this scene because Gongsun Yan was truly from a noble sect. His arrogance made sense, unlike the arrogance that Lin Yun displayed. But the corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he heard this because Gongsun Yan had been putting on an act right from the start.

He purposely executed the Void Shattering Sword Art to let others know about the relationship between his sect and the Sword Emperor. He even went out of his way to say how unfair it was to use the techniques that belonged to the Sword Emperor.

Does he really think that I will lose? It wasn’t just once or twice, but several times that Gongsun Yan put on a show. Perhaps this was what those with noble backgrounds were fond of doing. They wanted to trample over their opponents while displaying their background.

But Lin Yun ignored Gongsun Yan and activated the sword cocoon just when he was about to be stabbed.

Seeing that Lin Yun wasn’t admitting defeat, Gongsun Yan shook his head and said, “I apologize for this.”

Without any hesitation, his sword stabbed toward Lin Yun’s forehead. Just when everyone was expecting to see Lin Yun get hurt, Gongsun Yan’s sword froze. He failed to stab Lin Yun’s forehead as his sword was trembling violently.

Boundless sword intent surged out of Lin Yun’s forehead. Gongsun Yan’s sword began to tremble as the dragon coiling around Lin Yun began to shatter. When the dragon shattered, everyone was shocked because they had no idea what was going on. So they stood up in confusion to get a better look at what was happening. At the same time, the crowd could feel their swords trembling violently.

Lin Yun roared and released the quasi-divine firmament sword intent, causing the dragon that trapped him to crumble. Then, a dazzling silver light shined out of his body as his sword aura destroyed Gongsun Yan’s sword aura.

“Sword cocoon!” Gongsun Yan was deeply shocked as he realized why his attack failed. At the same time, he was sent flying a few hundred meters while groaning.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun charged forward and relied on his sword intent. As he merged with the heavens, he stood at the summit of a mountain and glanced down, “Soaring Azure Sky!”

His sword manifested into a gigantic sword ray that came crashing down on Gongsun Yan. It instantly sent Gongsun Yan flying out with a trace of blood dripping down from his lips. At the same time, he made use of the opportunity to grab onto his sword that was sent flying away.

“My Sword For Eternity!” Gongsun Yan didn’t dare to look down on Lin Yun and circulated the secret technique of the Void Shattering Sword Art. Nine swords fused with space appeared and opened up behind him like a fan. As his sword intent surged, it reached a height comparable to quasi-divine firmament sword intent.

“Soaring Phoenix Cry!” Gongsun Yan relied on this secret technique to execute his strongest sword technique while a powerful gale descended with the nine swords and released a sword buzz comparable to a phoenix cry.

When Gongsun Yan and Lin Yun clashed once more, the entire sky trembled. The spectators were shocked as dragons, phoenixes, birds, and mountains filled the sky. Fortunately, everyone was ready for the clash and protected themselves.

Not long later, the mountain collapsed and the phoenix cry disappeared. Lin Yun and Gongsun Yan were both evenly matched in this fight. Lin Yun had a stronger sword intent while Gongsun Yan executed a secret technique to forcibly raise his sword intent.

“Holy shit, why is their sword intent so terrifying? Is this real?!”

“The Sword Emperor’s lineage is indeed terrifying. No wonder the Sword Emperor could sweep through the Eastern Desolation with a sword.”

“That’s nothing. It’s already heaven-defying that Lin Yun could grasp the sky sword intent in the Heavenly Soul Realm, but he actually touched the threshold of the divine firmament sword intent!” Everyone was looking at Lin Yun with jealousy because they knew how hard it was to comprehend sword intent.

“In terms of sword intent, Lin Yun is still stronger,” said Zhao Yan with a grave expression. Lin Yun and Gongsun Yan were experts that he respected. But if he had to say something fair, then he would say that Lin Yun was a little stronger. After all, Gongsun Yan’s secret technique wouldn’t last for long.

“Don’t be so sure. The Sword Emperor’s lineage is very powerful. Gongsun Yan merely underestimated Lin Yun. Now that he’s getting serious, how can Lin Yun possibly be his opponent? The two of them aren’t on the same level,,” said Gong Haoran.

But Zhao Yan knew that Gongsun Yan didn’t underestimate his opponent. If Gongsun Yan could, he would’ve suppressed Lin Yun with a single move long ago. He just couldn’t accomplish it. But a sword fanatic like Zhao Yan naturally wouldn’t waste his breath arguing. After all, he preferred to fight.

Gong Haoran’s words convinced the people that were surrounding him. Gongsun Yan was from a noble sect, so he had to win. It didn’t make sense for Lin Yun to last long after Gongsun Yan got serious.

After another clash, both Lin Yun and Gongsun Yan separated. Gongsun Yan wore a smile as he looked at Lin Yun because he knew that his attainment in the sword would grow if he could defeat Lin Yun. He might even be able to grasp the divine firmament sword intent before the Elysium Core Realm.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. Quasi-divine firmament sword intent… Wind!” Gongsun Yan raised his sword before him as his hands formed ancient seals. Then, he summoned wind from the heavens and earth. Immediately, water droplets containing sword intent began to gather around him, “Water!”

As the wind and water perfectly fused together into swords, a Golden Phoenix appeared in the sky. It slowly became vivid as Gongsun Yan poured his vitality into it.

The phoenix let out a cry that sounded like celestial music. It caused the shackles on holding the gigantic sword to start trembling. Cracks even appeared on the surface of the gigantic sword, which shocked everyone.

Soon enough, Gongsun Yan’s holy spirit formed, which made the plaza look tiny. However, Lin Yun simply squinted his eyes as he charged towards Gongsun Yan with his Azure Birds.

As the Azure Birds clashed with the Golden Phoenix, Lin Yun dueled Gongsun Yan with his sword. Just like that, they fought until Gongsun Yan smiled. He obtained a slight advantage in the fight and said, “Everything is futile before my Sky Sword Eye. Not even the divine firmament sword intent can help you. You’ll be defeated today no matter what!”

He was determined to win this match no matter what. Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly because he was starting to get annoyed with Gongsun Yan’s acting. Taking a deep breath, the seven Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans bloomed while origin energy filled every corner of his body.

“Sun Concealing Clouds, Storm Clouds and Wind, Firmament Stirring Clouds… Clouds Manifesting Dragon…” As he breathed, Lin Yun executed ten swords that perfectly linked with each other. They were all powerful after reaching the manifestation stage and being empowered by the Fleeting CLoud Sword Sutra.

In the beginning, Gongsun Yan could match Lin Yun’s attacks. But after the sixth sword, he was starting to sweat. Lin Yun’s attacks were too fast for him.

“Can you break them all?” Lin Yun snorted before executing two more attacks - the Emerald Stars and Azure Mountain Beyond The Clouds. They were the 11th and 12th swords of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords.

As the boundless sea of clouds unfolded behind him, an immense sword aura swept out of Lin Yun. The surrounding space started to collapse from the pressure. At the same time, a terrifying white vortex appeared with a dazzling sword ray at the center. It caused fear to fill Gongsun Yan’s pupils because he was still busy dealing with Lin Yun’s 11th sword.

“No!” Gongsun Yan yelled as a hole appeared on his chest. In the next second, he slammed into a gigantic sword. When he slammed against the gigantic sword, the Lightning Shadow Sword that was sealed suddenly broke free and attacked Gongsun Yan. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When Gongsun Yan fell into the lake, the nine swords created by his secret technique shattered. Meanwhile, Lin Yun stood on the edge of the stage. He swept his gaze out, but no one dared to look him in the eye.
