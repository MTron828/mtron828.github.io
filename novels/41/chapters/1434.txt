Chapter 1435 - Dispute

Meanwhile, there was a towering peak located at the center of the Sword Sect, surrounded by numerous floating mountains. That was the Scarlet Firmament Peak. There was also a Saint Pool there, and the astral energy around the Saint Pool was dense.

Even if the seal on the Saint Pool wasn’t lifted, it could still increase one’s cultivation speed if one cultivated around it. A Saint Pool Square was nearby, with many Scarlet Firmament Peak disciples cultivating with their eyes closed. They all emitted a crimson light and boundless sword auras that made them look like a sun hanging in the sky.

There were many palaces at Saint Pool Square meant for direct disciples. The closer it was to the Saint Pool, the more majestic the palaces would be, and the number of people would gradually decrease.

As an azure figure streaked across the horizon, many disciples on the square opened their eyes. When they saw the azure figure, they gave a respectful greeting, and that azure figure also nodded with a smile. This azure figure was naturally Mu Qingqing.

She quickly passed the crowd and came to a certain palace. A woman was at the top of this palace, seated with her eyes closed. She was enveloped in a scarlet-crimson light, and she was also releasing a terrifying sword aura. Two dragons could faintly be seen from her sword aura, emitting a terrifying pressure. When Mu Qingqing saw this woman, she smiled as she came forward in an intimate manner.

“Where’s he?” That woman opened her eyes and could see Mu Qingqing walking over.

“Big Sister, let’s not talk about it. I failed to bring him over. He’s been taken in as a disciple by the Radiant Sword Saint, so how can I possibly open my mouth? I gave hidden hints, but he didn’t seem tempted. I can’t possibly tie him and drag him over, either; I can’t beat him.” Mu Qingqing pouted.

The woman she was talking to was Mu Xueqing, ranked third on the Heaven Ranking, and she was also the biological elder sister of Mu Qingqing. When Mu Xueqing heard what Mu Qingqing said, she couldn’t help smiling and her expression became gentle.

“You failed?” Mu Xueqing briefly pondered before she replied, “This is beyond my expectations. You didn’t tell him about the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra?”

“I did, but just think about his achievements. He grasped the firmament sword intent before the age of twenty. I bet that my words only made him more interested in it.”

“It has been tough on you.” Mu Xueqing nodded before she sighed, “What a pity… the Scarlet Firmament Peak is suitable for him. With his talent, he might be able to reach a level in the Scarlet Firmament Sword Sutra that even I can’t…”

“Big Sister, why do you care about him so much? He’s only at the Greater Elysium Core Realm.” Mu Qingqing asked out of curiosity. She knew her elder sister well, and it was rare for her elder sister to take an interest in someone. Even the first on the Heaven Ranking, Gu Ruochen, couldn’t draw her interest.

But her elder sister changed after watching the battle between Lin Yun and Xiahou Yan. Despite knowing it was against the rules, her elder sister told her to try and bring Lin Yun over to their Scarlet Firmament Peak. So she had no idea what her elder sister was planning.

“Greater Elysium Core Realm?” Mu Xueqing smiled. “The cultivation isn’t that important before the Dragon Pulse Realm, not to mention that he’s only been in the Kunlun Realm for a year. He has been cultivating in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect for the past year. The conditions in the Sword Sect are a hundred times better. So he’ll be able to catch up swiftly.”

“It doesn’t really matter, anyway. It’s not like he’ll become stronger than you, big sister. Not to mention those on the Heaven Ranking, but he has a long way to go compared to those Dragon Pulse Realm direct disciples.” Mu Qingqing replied.

Hearing what Mu Qingqing said, Mu Xueqin sent a strange look towards her younger sister and said, “You’ve been talking about him all the time ever since you came back from the Profound Wither Island. Now that I’m paying attention to him, why are you suddenly changing your tone?”

“I… I didn’t…” Mu Qingqing denied it with her face blushing.

Mu Xueqin stood up as she walked to the palace railing with her brows furrowed. There was a hint of melancholy in her pupils as she sighed, “There are a lot of things you don’t know about; this is a complicated matter. The Sword Sect needs someone to lead us.”

“What about Senior Brother Gu?” Mu Qingqing said sternly. Gu Ruochen was ranked first on the Heaven Ranking and was a top-tiered genius in the Ancient Barren Domain. He would have a position even in the Eastern Desolation.

“The world is bigger than you can imagine.” Mu Xueqin said indifferently. “The kind of person I’m talking about is someone like Jian Jingtian, who shocked the entire Eastern Desolation with his sword back then!”

Mu Qingqing was stumped when she heard that. Lin Yun might be outstanding, but he had just reached the Greater Elysium Core Realm. So Mu Qingqing couldn’t help feeling that her elder sister was exaggerating it.

“He should join the Scarlet Firmament Peak with his talent, nurtured with the resources of the entire sect. But it’s a pity that he joined the Divine Firmament Peak…” Mu Xueqin muttered to herself.

“It’s not that bad. He’s taken in as a disciple by Senior Radiant. So he won’t waste his talent.” Mu Qignqing replied.

But Mu Xueqin didn’t say anything. Others might not understand, but she was clear about it. It was fine if the Radiant Sword Saint could guide Lin Yun well, but she knew that the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t have much time to spare. So it was difficult for Lin Yun to be well-nurtured like the other saint disciples. But she couldn’t tell others about the Radiant Sword Saint.

Three days later, when dawn rose, the Divine Firmament Peak became bustling like never before. The reason for this was naturally because of Lin Yun’s arrival. Then again, that wasn’t the only reason. The Saint Pool’s seal would soon be lifted. Because of Lin Yun’s arrival, the peak master will lift nine layers of the seal and even give him the status of a direct disciple.

Regardless of it being the first or second news, they were both explosive. After all, lifting the seal every six months would only be limited to the seventh layer, and it was rare for the Sword Sect to lift nine layers. The more layers of the seal that were lifted, the greater the amount of astral energy would be available in the Saint Pool. This also meant that the person undergoing the baptism would receive more benefits.

This wasn’t only a piece of sensational news in the Divine Firmament Peak; many from the other peaks also came over. Aside from that, this was the first time in the history of the Sword Sect that someone was granted the status of a direct disciple just after joining the Sword Sect.

It wasn’t easy to obtain the status of a direct disciple. The Divine Firmament Peak had five thousand disciples but less than a hundred direct disciples. Most became direct disciples automatically after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm. Those in the Elysium Core Realm who became direct disciples had a part of the sect for at least two years.

This meant that they had completed a large number of missions, and they also had to undergo a series of tests. So it was unprecedented for someone to be granted the status as a direct disciple the moment he joined the Sword Sect. This wasn’t as simple as an exception, and this caused a huge wave in the Divine Firmament Peak because the quota for direct disciples was limited. So if Lin Yun became a direct disciple, someone would have to be removed.

The Saint Pool Square was filled with people and a group had gathered together to comfort a young man donned in a purple robe. If Lin Yun didn’t appear, this young man would have had a high chance of becoming a direct disciple.

“Senior Brother Chen Ling, there’s no need for you to feel too sad about this. You can wait another half a year to accept the baptism.” Those people tried to comfort the young man as they wore bitter smiles. They knew that no matter what they said, they couldn’t dispel the unhappiness in Chen Ling’s heart.

“Another half a year? I’ve been waiting for almost three years. I’m just one step away, but the sect gave that quota to Lin Yun. So how can I possibly suck it up?” Chen Ling’s face was ugly.

Everyone around him fell silent because they would also be unhappy if they were standing in his position. After all, Lin Yun had just joined the Sword Sect. Even if he defeated Xiahou Yan and spread the Sword Sect’s name, how could they be happy when their interest was affected?

Chen Ling’s strength was close to the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, so he naturally qualified to become a direct disciple and receive the Saint Pool Baptism. So how could he bear it when he was asked to wait for another six months?

After half a year, who knew whether there would be any more newcomers joining the Divine Firmament Peak? After all, no one could predict the future.

A couple of people descended from the sky while the Saint Pool Square was covered in discussions. They were Feng Luan and Lin Yun. When they appeared, the surrounding square fell into silence.

“Tsk, tsk. The atmosphere doesn’t seem quite right.” Lil’ Purple commented from inside the sword box.

Lin Yun didn’t speak, but he could also sense that the surrounding atmosphere wasn’t quite right. But before he could return to his senses, Chen Ling stepped forth and stood before them, “Senior Brother Feng!”

“He’s going!”

“I already expected that Senior Brother Chen wouldn’t be able to bear it.”

“Who can bear it if they’re in his position?” The surrounding eyes fell onto Chen Ling.

Chen Ling greeted Feng Luan before his gaze fell onto Lin Yun, “Senior Brother Feng, I believe you should know why I’m here!”

Feng Luan turned to look at Lin Yun and transmitted his voice over, “This is Chen Ling. There’s only one quota for the direct disciple position every six months, so…”

Lin Yun nodded with interest rising in his pupils. Did someone want to intimidate him when he arrived at the Divine Firmament Peak?

“I won’t intervene in this matter as long as everything is according to the Sword Sect’s rules. But the baptism is Lin Yun’s reward given by the sect master. So it won’t change anything even if you can’t accept it. At most, you can only make the sect master take back his status as a direct disciple. The baptism will continue no matter what.” Feng Luan explained.

If Lin Yun couldn’t get through this stage, no one could help him, even if the peak master was here, since everything had to be proven with strength. After all, you wouldn’t be able to convince the crowd if your fist wasn’t big enough.

Chen Ling looked at Lin Yun, “The Sword Sect was established with the sword, and swordsmen regard the swords as virtues. I’m impressed by what you did three days ago, but I can’t accept that the status as a direct disciple I’ve waited to get for three years is taken from me by a newcomer.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Oh? How can I convince you, then?” Lin Yun smiled as he looked around.

“As swordsmen, we naturally speak with our swords!” Chen Ling said in an aggressive tone with his sharp gaze.

Lin Yun looked around. He knew that Chen Ling wasn’t the only one who was unhappy. These people here had high seniority in the Divine Firmament Peak. So it was hard for him to convince everyone based on his record of defeating Xiahou Yan three days ago. Everyone knew Lin Yun was an unrivaled genius, but he still hadn’t grown up and was too tender!

“Come at me, then.” Lin Yun smiled while he cupped his hands together. Coincidentally, he also wanted to intimidate everyone by demonstrating his strength.
