Chapter 2269 - Turbulance

Ji Zixi threw out a mouthful of blood, her face becoming pale the moment those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain left. She was probably putting up a strong front earlier. She was so weak that she could only hold onto Lin Yun’s hand and said nothing.

“Her injuries are serious,” Li Feibai said with a grave expression.

“Lin Yun, don’t worry about me. Go and take a look at the divine flame fragments,” Ji Zixi said.

“You don’t have to worry about the divine flame fragments. It’s still early,” Lin Yun said as he injected his saint aura into Ji Zixi’s body through her wrist. He soon discovered that her injuries were very serious. Her internal organs and dragon pulses were damaged, but luckily her heart was still pumping with strong vitality. There was an ancient power guarding her heart, filled with an unimaginable power. It felt like a bright golden sun.

This inwardly shocked Lin Yun because this powerful vitality was slightly weaker than his Azure Dragon Divine Physique. If it weren’t for this power, Ji Zixi would’ve been killed by that earlier outburst of aura. But even with this power, Ji Zixi wasn’t in a good situation. There were cracks on her internal organs, with her vitality swiftly being corroded.

Her meridians were being corroded by yin energy. When Lin Yun’s saint aura came in contact with them, his saint aura started to get corroded and had even tried to get into his body, which forced Lin Yun to decisively break off the connection with his saint aura.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

As for the eight Saint Lords responsible for guarding Ji Zixi earlier, they had already lost their lives with their corpses shrivelling up.

This is the power of the Annihilation God Lord? Lin Yun was inwardly shocked. Aside from Ji Zixi’s heart, Zixi’s internal organs and flesh had died, and she would already be dead if she was ordinary. The price for breaking the restriction was something that no one had expected.

“Lin Yun, how’re my injuries…” Ji Zixi was like a drowning person, with her complexion becoming pale.

Right then, the center of the Flame Dragon Valley exploded with ancient runes soaring to the sky in the form of flames, and the sudden outburst left many people injured from the explosion.

“The divine flames!”

“The divine flame fragments exist!” Everyone in the Flame Dragon Valley looked like madmen as they looked at the flames. As the piercing sound echoed throughout the Flame Dragon Valley, multiple figures dashed over, and the Flame Dragon Valley fell into chaos.

Lin Yun turned a blind eye to that and released his sword intent. Despite the commotion, the area within a hundred meters in radius around him was calm.

“It’s not a big issue. You’ll get better soon,” Lin Yun said with a smile.

“You’re… lying…” Ji Zixi almost cried out, but she couldn’t help smiling. She naturally knew about her current condition. But for some reason, she smiled when Lin Yun said she would get better. She felt reassured when she looked at Lin Yun’s face, but it was a pity that she would soon be unable to see this face again.

“This is nothing. So why are you crying?” Lin Yun smiled as he wiped the tears off her face. He continued, “You’re a phoenix, so you won’t die so easily. Don’t worry about it, and believe me.”

Signaling Ji Zixi not to speak any further, Lin Yun looked at Li Feibai. When Li Feibai saw his grave expression, she tactfully nodded and retreated. She wanted to protect Lin Yun so that no one would disturb him.

“Let me help you up,” Lin Yun said, helping Ji Zixi sit upright on the ground before putting his hands on her back. Once the Blue Dragon Bone was activated, a blue dragon aura began pouring into her body. The blue dragon aura could nourish everything in the world, resolve any poison and contained unimaginable vitality.

Lin Yun was injured many times and relied on the Blue Dragon Bone to quickly recover. It didn’t take long before Ji Zixi began to recover under the boundless vitality. Her injuries gradually healed with her meridians, flesh, and organs being repaired.

Her situation seemed to have improved, but Lin Yun soon discovered he was wrong because her internal organs would tear apart the moment he let go of her. He frowned, “This is a little troublesome.”

“Is it serious?” Li Feibai asked.

“She won’t die… but she won’t live, either,” Lin Yun explained.

There was phoenix blood sealed within Ji Zixi’s heart, protected by an ancient energy. As long as that energy exists, Ji Zixi won’t die. This was also why the Divine Phoenix Mountain could hand Ji Zixi over to Lin Yun. But except for Ji Zixi’s heart, the other parts of her body were dead. This was equivalent to being a living dead, and those competing for the divine flame fragments probably never expected this to happen.

“Why is it so troublesome? She only lifted the restriction.” Li Feibai was baffled.

“The Annihilation God Lord probably left something behind to attack those who would try to forcefully break the restriction,” Lin Yun guessed. “This should have been meant for enemies, but he didn’t expect that the Flame Dragon who was guarding this place was dead and that there hadn’t been an heir to the divine flame fragments.”

With the death of the Flame Dragon, the restriction could only be forcibly broken.

“Her injuries…” Li Feibai asked.

“They’re not a big issue, but I’ll need some time to let her undergo nirvana,” Lin Yun smiled. He couldn’t help Ji Zixi recover by relying on the blue dragon aura. But if he could remove the seal on her heart, the phoenix fire in her heart would encase her, and all the yin energy would be expelled.

“Guard me, since the process will be dangerous and I cannot be interrupted,” Lin Yun said to Li Feibai.

Li Feibai nodded in response.

The entire Flame Dragon Valley fell into chaos since there was only one divine flame fragment after the restriction was removed. As a result, the five holy lands began fighting amongst themselves. The Ming Cult, Heavenly Flame Sect, and Myriad Lightning Sect grouped up to fight the Divine Dao Pavilion and Divine Phoenix Mountain.

But the situation wasn’t in favor of the three holy lands; the Divine Phoenix Mountain held the advantage instead. While they were facing the three holy lands, they could even intimidate the saint elders of the Divine Dao Pavilion. The Astral River Saint Lord unleashed a terrifying strength and obtained the divine flame fragment. Even with the three holy lands joining forces, they couldn’t keep him under control. But since there were too many people, it was difficult for the Astral River Saint Lord to safely escape.

The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord, Crow Shot Saint Lord, and Indigo Brave Saint Lord were all at the pinnacle of the fourth-stage Saint Lords. The Astral River Saint Lord had to hold onto the divine flame fragment and face the surrounding Saint Lords with one hand. At the same time, many Saint Lords from the Divine Phoenix Mountain joined the fight.

Anyone could tell that the Astral River Saint Lord wasn’t simple. He still displayed outstanding strength when facing the surrounding enemies with one hand. But the outcome would become unpredictable as time went by.

Huang Jingyu, who was fighting with the Saint Lords of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, looked at the Astral River Saint Lord with doubt.

Liu Yunlan said, “Something isn’t right. With the Astral River Saint Lord’s strength, he doesn’t look like a fourth-stage Saint Lord.”

The Astral River Saint Lord was at the fourth stage, but the strength he had displayed was a little too absurd. With just one hand, he could block the attacks from three fourth-stage Saint Lords without falling into a disadvantageous position. He was also the first to shatter the shockwave from the divine flame fragments and seize the divine flame fragment by himself.

“He can’t be a Saint Lord! He might be a Saint Sovereign or even a Great Saint…” Huang Jingyu muttered. He suspected the Astral River Saint Lord had sealed his strength to enter the God Burial Mountain Range.

The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord and Liu Yunlan’s faces changed upon hearing that. If that’s the case, the Astral River Saint Lord would be too bold. After all, entering the God Burial Mountain Range was dangerous, even if you sealed your cultivation.

The other holy lands have considered this method before, but they would lose a Saint Sovereign or a Great Saint if they failed. Most importantly, there was a high chance of failure.

The Ming Cult, the Heavenly Flame Sect, and the Myriad Lightning Sect had tried that method, but they had all failed. They lost two Saint Sovereigns, with a Great Saint being heavily injured. After that, the three holy lands didn’t dare to try it anymore.

“The Divine Phoenix Mountain must be planning something since they want the divine flame fragments,” Huang Jingyu emphasised. For the Divine Phoenix Mountain to take the huge risk of a Great Saint’s death, obtaining the divine flame fragment must be part of some plan. That means that if they succeed, the benefits would be much greater than the risk.”

“Do you want to use the Sovereign Saint Artifact?” Liu Yunlan asked. The three holy lands brought their Sovereign Saint Artifacts over, so Liu Yunlan wanted to strike heavily before they left with the divine flame fragment.

“There’s no need to hurry, look there.” Huang Jingyu swept his gaze over, having long noticed the injured Ji Zixi. With a smile, he revealed his plan, “Which do you think is more important? The divine flame fragment or Ji Zixi?”

This plan was shameless, but the Astral River Saint Lord would hand the divine flame fragment over to them if they succeeded, not to mention that they could preserve the Sovereign Saint Artifact as their trump cards. If they ran into the Blood Moon Sect after this, they would have more confidence in facing them. After all, obtaining the divine flame fragment didn’t mean that they were successful, since they would have to bring it out of the God Burial Mountain Range.

The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord and Liu Yunlan briefly hesitated before agreeing. Liu Yunlan said, “The masked person is probably Li Feibai.”

Li Feibai possessed a Sovereign Constellation, so he couldn’t be underestimated, as well as Lin Yun.

“It’s time to use the treasure obtained from the Blood Flame King… We can also use this opportunity to kill Lin Yun.” A vicious light flashed across Huang Jingyu’s eyes. Lin Yun was a huge threat that he had to get rid of.

At this moment, Lin Yun still had no idea that danger had come knocking on his door. He was using his sword intent to break the restriction around Ji Zixi’s heart while using the blue dragon aura to maintain her physique. He had to be careful because he would fail if he wasn’t careful.

Suddenly, danger arrived as Huang Jingyu descended from the sky. He was three thousand meters away from Lin Yun. He smiled, “Lin Yun, I’m afraid you won’t be able to treat the little princess with your means. So why don’t you let me try?”

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with murderous intent because Huang Jingyu was really getting on his nerves.

“Focus, don’t forget that I’m around.” Li Feibai secretly spoke to Lin Yun before she stood in front of him and Ji Zixi.
