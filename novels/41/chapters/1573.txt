Chapter 1574 - Smile

Lin Yun executed the Earth Sword Form before his sword technique suddenly changed, and each of his sword rays emitted a profound light. Whenever the whip flew at him, it would bounce back with an even more terrifying force. Luo Yuan couldn’t harm Lin Yun. The rebound force would numb Luo Yuan’s arm, with blood dripping from his palm.

After nine sword layers, an ancient ‘Profound’ word appeared. When the whip collided, it flew back with an even stronger power, and the whip turned into a flaming river when it flew back. This changed Luo Yuan’s face and he quickly let go of the whip.

Taking advantage of this moment, Lin Yun flew up and swung his sword at the golden dragon, executing the Aquaheaven Sword Technique. Three sword rays later, a white dragon flew out, and a person flew out from the moon hanging in the sky.

As the sword rays overlapped, Lin Yun created a hole in the divine dragon and drilled his way through. The pressure he felt plummeted, and a draconic roar echoed within his body. As his fifty thousand-foot dragon origin began to boil, the dragon origin filled his body under the circulation of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, and a ten-foot dragon appeared behind him.

“Ten feet!”

“He converted all of his astral energy into dragon origin!”

“How is this possible?!” The entire Heavenly Pool Manor fell into an uproar as Nangong Yan, and others looked at Lin Yun like they were looking at a monster. They only converted 30-40% of their astral energy into dragon origin, which was already impressive. But Lin Yun had converted all of his astral energy into dragon origin, reaching the pinnacle first-pulse upon stepping into the Dragon Pulse Realm.

This left everyone dumbfounded, shocked by the strength he had revealed. When the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord looked at Lin Yun, the name ‘Jian Jingtian’ immediately appeared within his mind, and he could see Jian Jingtian’s silhouette overlapping with Lin Yun.

“Not good!” Luo Yuan swiftly reacted and retreated, not caring about the whip he tossed to the side. But even if he swiftly responded, Lin Yun was still able to thrust his sword and pierce through Luo Yuan’s shoulder.

Throwing out a mouthful of blood, a ruthless light flashed across Luo Yuan’s pupils as he pushed his left flaming palm out at Lin Yun. He had circulated all his vitality into this attack, and they separated after exchanging an attack.

Luo Yuan fell to the ground, rolling. When he got back up, he raised his head and was surprised that his palm couldn’t harm Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun had nearly forty thousand dragon runes, and he managed to withstand this attack despite his vitality rumbling within his body.

Without any hesitation, Luo Yuan slammed his palm on the ground and charged forth, picking up the Sacred Goldflame Whip in the process. He no longer held back and executed the Lesser Heavenly Moon before ruthlessly lashing out with his whip. This time, the power behind his whip was enough to kill even second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses, cracking the space in the path of his whip.

Lin Yun pushed his movement technique to the limit, but he was too late. Even with the Flower Burial Sword blocking Luo Yuan’s attack, the huge impact still made Lin Yun’s internal organs rumble, and he nearly threw out a mouthful of blood.

“Die!” Luo Yuan wielded the Sacred Goldflame Whip and lashed it down. His whip sliced a portion of Lin Yun’s Golden Crow Wings, and the pain made the corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitch.

With a rotation of his hand, the Sacred Goldflame Whip revolved around Luo Yuan before manifesting into a golden flaming dragon that flew at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun managed to avoid the attack this time, but the ground still cracked, shattering the array’s runes on the floor. But Luo Yuan didn’t give up and continued to attack, with each attack aiming for a fatal point.

Simultaneously, two of the Sword Sect’s Heaven Ranking geniuses lost, and the four saint disciples held on with great difficulty. Jiang Cheng was sent flying with a palm, and Zhao Yan’s sword aura was crushed. Only Ye Ziling and Ye Ziyun were barely holding on.

As snowflakes flew before the Saint Dragon War Flag, Ye Ziling and Ye Ziyun had a Radiant Snow Flower blooming within their pupils. Ye Ziling was enveloped in snow and lightning, with a divine dragon faintly appearing on her, and each of her attacks were accompanied by the power of a divine dragon. On the other hand, Ye Ziyun didn’t hold on for long before she fell to her knees after a palm.

“I still can’t catch up to you…” Ye Ziyun bitterly smiled while looking at Ye Ziling.

Ye Ziling didn’t say a word, but waved her hand and sent the injured Ye Ziyun away before facing Liu Yu and Bai Kuang head-on. Although those two had exhausted a great deal of their energy through a series of battles, they were increasingly ferocious as they fought.

They initially thought they could deal with Ye Ziling, who was alone. But whenever they tried to get close to her, the Radiant Snow Flower within her pupils would start revolving, emitting a golden radiance. Her Radiant Snow Bloodline wasn’t the same as Ye Ziling’s, and the golden light made her pupils look like a dragon's pupils instead.

As a result, Liu Yu and Bai Kuang trembled under her gaze and couldn’t bring out the full power of their cultivations.

Amidst the snowflakes, Ye Ziling was like a dragon with lightning crackling while wielding her saint sword. Her current state might look a little pathetic, but she didn’t take a step back from the Saint Dragon War Flag. It was as though the flag was the flag of the Sword Sect, and she wouldn’t give up on it. Thus, she was naturally in a dangerous position.

“You still dare to be distracted during our fight?” Luo Yuan’s gaze turned cold, and the Sacred Goldflame Whip wrapped around the Flower Burial Sword.

Lin Yun tried pulling his sword out from the Sacred Goldflame Whip, but he failed no matter how hard he tried. Simultaneously, flames would spread from the whip over to his sword, causing the sword in his hand to blaze.

Luo Yuan also tried to pull the whip to pull the sword out of Lin Yun’s hands. But when he discovered he couldn’t pull the sword over, he loosened his grip on the whip and dashed forth.

This made Lin Yun’s face change, and he quickly retreated.

“I already said that everyone from the Sword Sect will go down on their knees today!” Luo Yuan pounced forth with a sinister smile. Lin Yun’s greatest reliance was his sword intent. Luo Yuan didn’t believe Lin Yun could fight him without his sword.

Lin Yun was suppressing the flames with his right hand. When he saw Luo Yuan charging over, he glared, executing the Divine Dragon Eyes—Sun and Moon Gaze.

This was the gaze that Lin Yun used when he glared at Huang Xuanyi. But Luo Yuan was long prepared, and poured his dragon origin into his eyes. But even so, he was still forced back by the sudden outburst of divine dragon aura.

Looking at the flames blazing on the sword in his right hand, Lin Yun ultimately gave up on it and waved his hand, summoning the White Dragon Saint Sword. When he held onto the sword, the terrifying chill from the sword instantly extinguished the flames on his Flower Burial Sword. The chill made Lin Yun feel comfortable, and this White Dragon Saint Sword really was a Radiant Saint Sword.

When Luo Yuan saw the White Dragon Saint Sword in Lin Yun’s hands, he immediately became anxious because he spent so much effort in getting the sword. So how could he possibly let Lin Yun obtain it?

But Lin Yun smiled and turned around, “Ye Ziling, catch!”

The White Dragon Saint Sword was like a streak of light as it flew over and arrived before Ye Ziling. When Ye Ziling reached out, the sword flew into her right hand, and the divine dragon coiling around her became even more realistic, looking like an actual snow-white divine dragon.

“Not good!” Liu Yu and Bai Kuang immediately felt immense pressure as Ye Ziling’s sword aura rapidly rose.

“You’re courting death!” Luo Yuan roared, seeing Lin Yun throwing the sword away. His vitality blazed like flames. As his heart pumped, it was like a cauldron as three dragon images appeared behind him. This was his advantage after having his vitality transformed upon reaching the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Not even Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Art could compete with him.

When Lin Yun circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, Luo Yuan’s punches rained down, and each punch would make him let out a groan while taking several steps back. After ten-odd punches, Lin Yun had no more space to retreat and was forced into a dead-end. But a Netherflower bloomed behind him, and this flower had twenty-four petals that looked like a layer of heaven.

“Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, go down on your knees!” Luo Yuan threw another punch that felt like a roaring flame dragon.

Facing Luo Yuan’s attack, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron rose from the dragon origin ocean, and Lin Yun’s pupils instantly became crimson with a destructive power filling his body. Forcibly calming his mind to not be affected by it, Lin Yun triggered the heavenly dragon on the cauldron before throwing a punch out.

When the two punches came in contact, Luo Yuan was sent flying while Lin Yun remained where he was.

“How is this possible…?” Luo Yuan threw out a mouthful of blood, looking at Lin Yun in disbelief. He might have just reached the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, but how could he not suppress Lin Yun, who had just reached the Dragon Pulse Realm, especially when Lin Yun didn’t even have a sword in his hand?

As unwillingness filled his chest, Luo Yuan roared, “Flame Dragon Fist!”

He used the martial technique that he had used to defeat the three experts previously. This made everyone feel immense pressure because they could see an origin saint rune condensing in Luo Yuan’s palm. It was the Flame Dragon Saint Rune. His Flame Intent and the Flame Dragon Saint Rune brought this high-grade ghost spirit martial technique to an unbelievable height.

But to everyone’s surprise, Lin Yun was the one who attacked first, taking a step forth. When he flew in the air, his meridians, vitality, muscles, dragon runes, and even his sword intent poured into his arms as he formed seals with both hands.

Every single time he made a seal, his vitality would be exhausted, converted to dragon aura. Lin Yun's hands joined together as the dragon aura overlapped ten times, and a profound seal appeared within his palms. Lin Yun’s pupils became golden in that split second, and an oppressive aura swept out from him.

Sovereign Dragon Fist—Soaring Divine Dragon!

A hundred divine dragons flew out of his body when he threw his punch. When his fist came in contact with Luo Yuan’s fist, the latter’s arm was blown to smithereens. This made Luo Yuan throw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away.

Luo Yuan was stumped upon seeing his missing limb, and everyone in the manor fell silent. Even the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was dumbfounded for a long time before he raised his head to look at Lin Yun with his scalp tingling.

On the other hand, Ye Ziling thrust her sword towards Liu Yu and Bai Kuang, leaving a hole in their bodies as they fell to their knees.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

When Lin Yun raised his head, his gaze bumped into Ye Ziling, who looked over as well, and they both smiled.
