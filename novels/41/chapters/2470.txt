Chapter 2471 - Fighting With An Emperor

When Yu Qingfeng tapped on Lin Yun’s forehead, boundless sword intent began pouring into his sword sea. His saint aura began to rumble under the sword intent, and Yu Qingfeng’s cultivation also poured into Lin Yun’s violet palace.

This process lasted a long time, enveloping the entire mountain’s summit in a dazzling radiance. All the swordsmen present were shocked to discover that one of the suns above the Skysolute City was swiftly disappearing.

“Master!” Dao Suspend Sword Saint and the other Skysolute City disciples quickly descended on their knees.

Seeing one of the sun's disappearing, the other swordsmen recovered from their senses and yelled, “We send the Sword Emperor off!”

“We send the Sword Emperor off!”

Lin Yun opened his eyes on the summit and saw Yu Qingfeng spreading his arms apart. Wearing a smile, he began to fly and gradually dissipated before exploding. When he dissipated, the light particles formed into a rain pouring on the Skysolute City before landing on the sword mound.

“We will meet again,” Lin Yun muttered. He quickly sat down on the summit to refine and comprehend the sword intent that Yu Qingfeng left behind. The sword intent was too much that sword rays were dissipating from his pores.

Lin Yun calmed himself, and his consciousness sank into his sword sea. There was a bright sun above the sword sea, like a ball of flame entering his body through the sword sea. He knew that he had to refine them, or he would waste one-third of it.

He had two sword souls: the bright sun in the sky and the other was a golden azure dragon in the sun's depth. But what was he going to refine them into?

In the end, Lin Yun merged the two sword souls into the Heavenly Dragon Sword Soul. With the Heavenly Dragon Sword Soul, he would be complete with the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique and Heavenly Dragon Bone, allowing his strength to transform.

Refining the sword intent given by Yu Qingfeng, the radiance he released began to dim, and the dissipated sword intent also gathered around him like fireflies.

As time passed and the sun representing Yu Qingfeng dissipated, a new light was born seven days later. The dissipated sword intent gathered to form another sun, rising to the sky.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, a Heavenly Dragon formed in his sword sea.

“I succeeded.” Lin Yun let out a breath and released a powerful radiance. He didn’t jump down the mountain but slowly walked down. It was hard to climb the mountain but harder to ascend it. This was a trial in which Lin Yun closed his eyes and walked down.

There was a gate in his mind, and behind the gate was sword intent beyond the ninth-grade. That was what Yu Qingfeng saw back then, and he gave that all to Lin Yun. But it was better for Lin Yun to see it and push it open himself. At that time, he could compare them and strengthen his attainment in sword dao.

Now, Lin Yun was trying to comprehend the profundity and push his sword intent beyond the ninth-grade. With his foundation, the ninth-grade sword intent was the limit, and he would be trapped in it like his master. But he was fortunate that he ran into Yu Qingfeng.

Yu Qingfeng transferred all his comprehension and the sword intent he had accumulated for three thousand years to him. They couldn't withstand such a powerful sword intent if it was someone else or even the Dao Suspend Sword Saint.

His speed slowed as Lin Yun descended the mountain, but the path was increasingly easier. When he returned to the foot of the mountain, he opened his eyes, and there was a nine-colored flower close to his saint origin. That flower represented dao, and it was the sword dao. Other than this, there were two flowers representing Ying-Yang and Nirvana Daos.

Lil’ Purple sat on the Iris Sword Box, looking at Lin Yun with disbelief. Looking at the untainted Lin Yun, she jumped down the sword box and held onto his hand.

“What are you doing?” Lin Yun smiled.

“You look like you’re going to ascend at any moment, like ancient immortals. This is weird. What did you obtain from Yu Qingfeng?” Lil’ Purple asked, heaving in relief.

“Pass me the sword box. We’ll talk as we walk,” Lin Yun smiled. He had nothing to hide from Lil’ Purple and told her everything, which Lil’ Purple was shocked after hearing it.

“Sword intent beyond the ninth-grade? That’s a legend, and...I don’t remember anyone reaching it, even in ancient times. Only the Sword Ancestor managed to achieve it.” Lil’ Purple was shocked. She looked at Lin Yun and continued, “To a certain degree, you can be considered a Sword Immortal.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thought, and he said, “Maybe. The Sword Immortal beyond the Kunlun Realm was comparable to the Deity Realm and could even kill deities. I’m still lacking in comparison. Let us jump down, master, and everyone else is on the plaza.”

Lin Yun saw all the swordsmen gathered in the plaza, including his master and martial siblings. He soared to the sky with Lil’ Purple and landed on the plaza.

“Congratulations, Flower Burial!” When he descended, the surrounding swordsmen congratulated him, including the Skysolute City’s disciples. Everyone knew Lin Yun had received Yu Qingfdeng’s inheritance, and they couldn’t imagine how powerful he had become.

“Sect master, you’re too polite,” Lin Yun cupped his fists together.

“Flower Burial, let me congratulate you as well. Here’s a toast for you!” A voice interrupted. When Lin Yun swept his gaze over, he saw a wine cup expanding in his eyes.

This made the faces of many swordsmen change, and quickly retreated. But Lin Yun merely reached out and grabbed onto the wine cup. When the impact from the wine cup spread, the entire plaza began to tremble, with many people staggering.

Lin Yun squinted before discovering that the cup came from the Frostsnow Sacred Palace’s Ice Emperor. Just when he was baffled, the White and Black Emperors landed beside Lin Yun with the Radiant Sword Emperor.

“What are you trying to do?” The White Emperor asked.

The Ice Emperor smiled, “Well, I have to resolve our karma no matter what. After all, the Freezing Chill Divine Rune was seized by him, and I naturally have to give him a toast.”

Lin Yun finally understood what was going on upon hearing that.

“What you! That belongs to the Iris Sword Saint ten thousand years ago!” Lil’ Purple said.

“I borrowed the Freezing Chill Divine Rune. Even if you want to settle the account, you should do it with me,” the White Emperor smiled.

“I have nothing to say if you told me you want to give it to Flower Burial. But you said that you wanted to borrow it, and I can’t just suck it up,” the Ice Emperor rolled his eyes. It wasn’t that he couldn’t tolerate giving it to Lin Yun, but at least that meant Lin Yun would owe him one. But the White Emperor forcibly borrowed it from him, which depressed him.

He was increasingly furious the more he thought about it, and he had been bearing it for a long time.

The White Emperor looked awkward. He might have borrowed the Freezing Chill Divine Rune, but it was done forcibly.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts, and he could tell the Ice Emperor wasn’t trying to do anything serious. He stepped forward and cupped his fists, “I’ll drink this wine from you.”

Gulping down the wine, Lin Yun smiled, “I wonder what senior plans to do? Since the White Emperor borrowed it, I will give it back half a month from now.”

The Ice Emperor smiled, “No need for that. I only have one request, which is to fight me. Regardless of the outcome, you can keep the Freezing Chill Divine Rune, returning it to where it belonged, as the little girl said.”

Hearing what the Ice Emperor said, the White and Black Emperors heaved in relief, and even the Radiant Sword Emperor found it fair. The battle acknowledged this favor and gave both sides a step down.

“Previously, I couldn’t say anything as you hadn’t reached the Emperor Realm. But now that you can ascend that mountain, that means you’re capable of clashing with Emperors,” the Ice Emperor smiled.

“I dare not. I’m happy that senior is willing to guide me,” Lin Yun smiled, cupping his fists together. He gave the Ice Emperor a face because the Freezing Chill Divine Rune was a favor no matter how he looked at it. If he was in the Ice Emperor’s position, he might not be so generous with it.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, the Ice Emperor smiled, “Hahaha! Great!”

Everyone on the plaza was shocked before they came to their senses. Lin Yun was going to fight an Emperor now?

The Radiant Sword Emperor and the Black and White Emperors came to their senses, but they didn’t stop this fight. After all, Lin Yun would soon fight the Empress at the ceremony, and the Ice Emperor was the best candidate to test his strength with.

“Let me see the limit of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique. You should have remnant energies of the Heavenly Dragon Bone that you hadn’t refined, right?” The Ice Emperor smiled.

“Okay.” Lin Yun agreed. He also wanted to see where his limit was and which was stronger between the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique and Emperor Realm’s golden physique. There were rumors that every emperor would reforge their bodies after reaching the Emperor Realm, also known as the Golden Emperor Physique.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
