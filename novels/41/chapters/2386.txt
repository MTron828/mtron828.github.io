Chapter 2387 - Good Show About To Start

There were only five days left until the Heavenly Barren Banquet. During that time, under Yue Weiwei’s help, Ji Zixi managed to undo the seal on her bloodline, while Lin Jiangxian and Lin Yun were trying to grasp the Five Elements Dao and Yin-Yang Dao, respectively.

Five days later, in Lin Yun’s courtyard, there was a Yin-Yang Painting beneath Lin Yun’s feet as he performed a fist technique. His punches were slow, but the Yin-Yang Painting would revolve whenever he threw a punch.

As the Yin-Yang Painting revolved, the energy coming from Lin Yun accumulated with the Azure Dragon’s divine blood coursing through his body and boiled in his veins. The power of the Sovereign Constellation also gathered onto Lin Yun, with the Azure Dragon Constellation faintly being seen in the sky.

The fist technique was comprehended from the profundity of Yin-Yang Dao, fusing the Yin-Yang Dao with the Azure Dragon Constellation to unleash an unimaginable power. Once the terrifying power accumulated in his fists, Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword and started swinging it around. Due to all the amassed power, Lin Yun’s sword technique was swift, forming a drastic comparison with his fist technique.

Lin Yun would alternate between fast and slow, and even space was dragged over when his sword ray revolved, forming a terrifying scene. The fist technique and sword technique were opposites of each other, but they were connected as well, and this was something Lin Yun comprehended.

He gave them simple names, Yin-Yang Fist and Yin-Yang Sword. The names were crude, but they were befitting, regardless of the fist or sword technique, since they both came from Yin-Yang Dao.

This was because Lin Yun had grasped Yin-Yang Dao last night. His trump cards were heaven-defying, possessing two Sovereign Constellations and two Eternal daos.

Lin Yun stopped at dawn. When he came out, he saw Ji Zixi and Yue Weiwei. He said, “It’s time to leave.”

Ji Zixi and Yue Weiwei interacted well in the courtyard, and they looked like two sisters, two fairies. This left Lin Yun dumbfounded, and he increased his pace when he came to his senses. Walking over, he looked at Ji Zixi and asked, “Why did you remove your veil?”

Ji Zixi looked at Yue Weiwei, and smiled, “Big Sister Yue told me to remove it. She said that you will deal with it if anything happens.”

“How am I supposed to deal with it?” Lin Yun awkwardly smiled.

“You deal with it,” Yue Weiwei snorted.

“That’s right, Big Brother Lin will take responsibility for anything that happens!” Ji Zixi smiled, looking like a doll.

This made Lin Yun briefly stunned, before he asked, “Wait, since when have you two become sisters?”

“Why else?” Yue Weiwei smiled. “Did you expect us to fight?”

Ji Zixi looked bashful and blissful. She smiled, “Yeah. Big Sister Yue told me a lot about Big Brother Lin.”

“What did she tell you?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

Ji Zixi looked at Yue Weiwei, and smiled, “She told me about your story with her in the Profound Amber Realm. Big Brother Lin was really bold to jump down the cliff. She also told me about the Heavenly Path and how you saw a few girls at the Nirvana Banquet’s lake... and... and...”

“That’s enough,” Lin Yun interrupted.

“And Su Ziyao!” Ji Zixi smiled, “Big Brother Lin has a lot of stories.”

Lin Yun looked at Yue Weiwei helplessly, before he smiled, “Why did you tell her everything?”

“I got Big Sister Yue to tell me, so don’t blame her for it,” Ji Zixi said.

“Why would I dare blame her?” Lin Yun smiled bitterly. He didn’t dare because Yue Weiwei was even more fierce than Su Ziyao, despite how docile she usually looked. In reality, Yue Weiwei was the one he feared the most.

“The sun is pretty good today,” A voice resounded as Lin Jiangxian appeared.

“Lin Jiangxian, when did you arrive?” Lin Yun asked.

“I’ve been here for some time,” Lin Jiangxian smiled. She then dropped her smile, and said, “Lin Yun, women have dulled your senses.”

Lin Yun was stumped while Ji Zixi looked at Lin Jiangxian with her eyes shining. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“That’s right. Women have made you dull,” Yue Weiwei smiled. Her smile was so charming that even Lin Jiangxian was briefly stunned.

When Lin Jiangxian came to her senses, she smiled, “Well, I would be attracted to her even if I’m a woman.”

Yue Weiwei was happy upon being praised, and Lin Jiangxian was more pleasing to her eyes now.

When Lin Yun examined Lin Jiangxian, he joyfully exclaimed, “You succeeded?”

Lin Jiangxian nodded without saying a word. When Lin Yun turned to look at Ji Zixi, he was shocked to discover that Ji Zixi had become unfathomable. Even his sword intent could sense a blazing heat coming from Ji Zixi with a phoenix in the flames. Turning to Yue Weiwei, he could feel she had probably relied on her strength to forge her name as the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden.

Lin Yun immediately realized that women had dulled his senses, but it was still fortunate that he was stronger than them.

Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue also came over. Xiong Tiannan first looked at the three women before he turned to Lin Yun with a smile, “Lin Yun, when are we going?”

“Now. You guys want to come along with us?” Lin Yun asked.

“Of course!” Xiong Tiannan said excitedly. “This is the Heavenly Barren Banquet. Ao Jue and I might not be able to participate, but we won’t miss the performance of you and the sister-in-laws!”

Ao Jue smiled, “Sister-in-laws? How many are there?”

Xiong Tiannan was about to reply, but he shut his mouth when his gaze swept through Yue Weiwei, Ji Zixi, and Lin Jiangxian. One? Two? Or three? He immediately tossed that to the back of his mind, as if it hadn’t happened before. He looked at Lin Yun for help, who pretended not to see him.

Right then, Yue Weiwei smiled, “You can treat it as three.”

Everyone was shocked upon hearing that, including Lin Yun. Ji Zixi was bashful, while Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue were surprised before they enviously looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Jiangxian was briefly stunned, before she smiled, “That works. The Heavenly Phoenix Maiden and Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden are mine. Lin Yun can be the lackey, and I don’t have to use my sword with him around.”

Xiong Tiannan’s jaw dropped, before he said, “What a surprise, Lin Jiangxian.”

Everyone laughed as they headed to the Heavenly Saint Courtyard. There would be a huge battle during the Heavenly Barren Banquet. But they didn’t look worried as they laughed while they headed over.

This was probably Lin Yun’s final battle before returning to the Kunlun Realm. This made him feel a little more relaxed with a hint of concern.

When they left, they saw that the entire city was filled with figures and that everyone was headed to the Heavenly Saint Courtyard through various means. On the spacious streets, there were even carriages bolting through the streets, and they were all heading in one direction.

Not only was the entire Heaven’s Gate Star alarmed, but many seniors and geniuses from the three thousand realms as well. This scene even left Lin Yun in shock. Even the Kunlun Realm at its prime might not have been able to surpass this scene.

When the Heavenly Saint Mountain was within sight, a figure streaked across the horizon that caused an uproar.

“That’s the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son!” This person was the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, whom Lin Yun met a few days ago.

More people streaked across the horizon, following the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son. They were the disciples from Qilin Mountain. Many people raised their heads, since it was rare to see a legend like the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, especially when the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was barely thirty years old. They exclaimed, “It looks like Qilin Mountain is confident about this.”

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was a dazzling figure even in the three thousand realms, but disagreement soon resounded, saying how the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son suffered a huge loss from the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain and a swordsman.

“Big Brother Lin, they’re talking about you,” Yue Weiwei smiled. She and Ji Zixi were wearing veils because everyone turned to look at them the moment they stepped out.

“Yeah, they’re all talking about you!” Ji Zixi smiled, acting as if she had become a lackey behind Yue Weiwei. She had also become bolder than before.

Lin Yun glanced at them from afar, and said, “A good show is about to start.”
