Chapter 1494 - Bizarre Saint Elixir

Lin Yun and An Liuyan were curious if that young man was Xiao Yun. It would be too shocking if it was true that someone at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm would have such terrifying fighting prowess.

Lin Yun already suspected Xiao Yun’s true strength when he found the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm with his Profound Yin Saint Eyes. He felt that Xiao Yun had concealed a massive part of his strength.

They were fast, and it didn’t take long for an herbal garden to appear before them. The herbal garden was bizarre, since it was in a cave, and every single herb was an ice-attributed ten thousand-year saint elixir. The garden was enveloped in various lights that looked dazzling.

With a rough estimation, there were at least a hundred saint elixirs, which was a huge opportunity. But Lin Yun quickly looked away as two people were still fighting in the garden. One was Xiao Yun, and the other was an old man.

The old man was at the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, possessing a peculiar movement technique that could turn him into fog. His movement speed wasn’t fast, but it was bizarre, thus giving him a lot of advantages.

The herbal garden was covered in blood, and ten-odd corpses were lying on the ground. Judging from their injuries, it looked like a hammer had pulverized them. This scene made Lin Yun and An Liuyan exchange a gaze with surprise; they couldn’t believe that this was something done by Xiao Yun.

While the two were shocked, the old man was struck by Xiao Yun just before he was about to turn into fog. His punch was like a ferocious beast that tore the old man’s body into pieces. From Xiao Yun, Lin Yun could sense a familiar aura, and this caused surprise to flash through his pupils.

“Hehe. Brother Lin, Envoy An, you’re both here.” Xiao Yun smiled.

“This is all done by you?” An Liuyan asked, pointing at the ground.

“Who else? Don’t say that I didn’t take care of you guys. You guys can take whatever you need. Hehe, we’re fortunate this time. I suspect that there’s a huge secret in this Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.” Xiao Yun smiled with his head tilted.

When he was done, he ignored the two and began dashing around in the herbal garden. An Liuyan turned to look at Lin Yun because he had no idea what Xiao Yun meant. After all, those who tried to snatch the saint elixirs were either killed or chased away by Xiao Yun. So who knew if Xiao Yun would flip the table when they went to pick the saint elixirs?

But Lin Yun nodded to her, telling her not to worry. The three quickly swept through the saint elixirs, with Xiao Yun laughing. But soon, he couldn’t smile anymore because he realized that those saint elixirs couldn’t be placed into his interspatial bracelet, which was strange.

“What’s going on?” Xiao Yun’s face changed.

But just when everyone was suspicious, the saint elixirs dissolved into sparkling dust and flew towards the cave's depth. This made Xiao Yun so furious that he threw out a mouthful of blood, his face turning black.

Lin Yun reached out and grabbed a grain of dust. Staring at it for a while, he was confident that the saint elixirs from before weren’t an illusion, and he could sense the herbal effects contained in the dust. But he had no idea what was going on.

Right then, their faces changed because they could sense a large group of cultivators at the entrance, and they were all enveloped in a menacing aura. Since Xiao Yun wasn’t in a good mood, this instantly made him even more furious, “Looks like these people didn’t get beaten enough. Brother Lin, I’ll be back shortly.”

“Wait up!” Lin Yun wanted to stop him, but Xiao Yun was already nowhere to be seen.

“What’s the matter?” An Liuyan asked when she saw the worried expression on Lin Yun’s face.

“Do you think that those people will come back after they were given a beating?” Lin Yun asked.

“So…” An Liuyan’s eyes began to flicker, and she instantly understood what Lin Yun meant.

“So they might be from the Netherworld Hall. Lan Siyu probably came back with helpers.” Lin Yun said in a specific tone.

“Can Xiao Yun face them?” An Liuyan frowned. She knew that the Netherworld Hall wasn't a pushover, and every one of the seven core disciples was known for their brutality, aside from Lan Siyu.

Right when she was done speaking, a figure was sent flying over. This person was Xiao Yun, who had rushed out earlier.

“Tsk, tsk. You’re quite something to survive under my palm.” An eerie voice resounded from afar.

“Kill him. There’s no need to waste time with someone like him.” Another voice resounded. This voice was filled with contempt.

“It’s Ku Ying and Xie Feng!” An Liuyan’s face changed with deep fear flashing in her pupils.

“Damn it. You just wait…!” Xiao Yun cursed before he turned around and fled. He even reminded them when he passed by Lin Yun and An Liuyan.

“What should we do now?” An Liuyan nervously looked at Lin Yun.

“Let’s hide for now.”

“Hide? How?” An Liuyan was puzzled because they were underground, and hiding was easier said than done.

But without waiting for her to react, Lin Yun formed the Iris Saint Seal before grabbing her shoulder and soaring into the sky. The entire world began to spin in the next second before they disappeared.

When they reappeared, they were in the Iris Secret Realm, and An Liuyan was looking around in shock before she turned to look at Lin Yun. She was filled with doubt at this moment, and she was utterly shocked by this. Ultimately, she couldn’t help but ask, “Where are we right now?”

“This is the Iris Secret Realm. I’ll tell you about it later…” Lin Yun walked towards the Phoenix Tree seedling and asked, “Empress, can you help me see what’s going on outside?”

“Hmph, you actually brought an outsider in. You do know that you’ll die a terrible death if the secret of this place is exposed, right?” Lil’ Purple furiously looked at Lin Yun.

“She won’t.” Lin Yun replied.

This made Lil’ Purple furious, but she still waved her hand, and a light screen appeared before them. From where they previously were, ten-odd figures appeared.

Lan Siyu was first to enter, and he coldly said, “There were two people here earlier, and it’s very likely to be those two.”

Not long later, Xie Feng and others appeared. When Xie Feng appeared, Lin Yun instantly focused on these people, and he could sense that the wings behind him weren’t simple.

Xie Feng simply looked around and did nothing. But Ku Ying said, “The yin aura will become more terrifying beyond this place, and this cave gives me the feeling that this is a separate world.”

“The saint elixirs are taken by those three. Are we going to give chase?” Lan Siyu was a little afraid as he looked at the depths of the cave. He definitely wouldn’t dare to enter by himself.

“The eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts will come with me. As for the rest, all of you stay here to prevent anyone from entering or exiting. I feel that the opportunity here might not be inferior to the Dragon Burial Valley…” Xie Feng instantly gave out commands.

“W-What about me?” Lan Siyu was a little timid and was afraid that Xie Feng would do something with An Liuyan when he wasn’t around.

“Junior Brother, you’re the direct descendant of the Lan Clan, and I won’t be able to explain it if you die here.” Xie Feng turned around with a smile.

“Hmph, Xie Feng, don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking!” Lan Siyu unhappily glared at Xie Feng. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Okay, then. You and Ku Ying can continue on, while I wait here. What do you think?” Xie Feng smiled.

Seeing the smile on Xie Feng’s face, Lan Siyu raised his head to look at the dark hole and cursed, “I’ll wait here. Don’t you dare touch An Liuyan!”

“Hahaha!” Xie Feng simply ignored him and ordered, “Let’s go!”

When he was done, he led all of the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts and went deeper into the cave, leaving behind Lan Siyu and six others. They were cautious, and a saint spiritualist even took out flags and divine astral pellets to set up three arrays.

Within the Iris Secret Realm, Lin Yun looked at An Liuyan, “Looks like he hasn’t given up on you.”

“Don’t make fun of me. I have nothing to do with him!” An Liuyan’s face blushed, and she changed the topic, “What should we do now? If we allow them to give chase, Xiao Yun will definitely be in danger!”

“He took an attack from a nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm expert, and can still run. That’s not something we can do. We should think about how we should deal with these people, or we can’t leave.” Lin Yun replied.

An Liuyan looked at Lin Yun in disbelief. She didn’t think Lin Yun couldn't take an attack from a nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. But when she suddenly sensed a surge of killing intent from Lin Yun, she felt a chill down her spine and asked, “W-What are you going to do?”

“What do you think I should do to that person who dared threaten me with the Netherworld Hall?” Lin Yun calmly replied.

“But these people are all at the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. They’re a lot stronger than the demonic cultivators from before, and they’re all guest deacons nurtured by the Netherworld Hall.” An Liuyan knew what Lin Yun wanted to do, but she worried about his safety.

“It’s true that it’s not easy for me alone. But it’s a different story with your help.” Lin Yun said. There were seven people, some of whom might escape if they had focused on fleeing.

“Alright, what do you want me to do?” An Liuyan raised her head to look at Lin Yun.

“Stop whoever tries to run. As for the rest, just act accordingly.” After Lin Yun was done, he took out the Silver Moon Mask and put it on.

As his hair fluttered, his whole body turned silver, and even his temperament underwent a drastic transformation. An Liuyan definitely wouldn’t dare to believe it if she didn’t witness it personally.
