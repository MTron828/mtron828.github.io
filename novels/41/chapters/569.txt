Chapter 570 - I'll Wait For You Tomorrow

Lin Yun’s sword intent roared like rumbling lightning and caused the clouds to roll. At the same time, everyone looked at the azure-clothed youth in shock.

The White Jade Academy’s trump card, Cao Xiu, was killed by the same attack that made Jiang Yi surrender. The White Jade Academy wasn’t even willing to send Cao Xiu out in the first two matches, which made this situation even more pitiful. In the end, Lin Yun had once again brought out that attack that looked like a thunderbolt.

Everyone had ultimately underestimated Lin Yun’s attack. It was only after it fell onto Cao Xiu when they realized how powerful it was. The powerhouses couldn’t believe that Lin Yun had such a powerful attack when he was only in the Yin stage of the Violet Palace Realm.

His attack was simply too powerful, which filled them with doubt. But no matter how unbelievable they thought it was, the fact remained that the White Jade Academy had completely lost. Lin Yun first severed Luo Shen’s arms before decapitating him. Then, Lin Yun turned Chen Yu into ashes. As for Cao Xiu, he died with the most grievance as he could clearly put up a fight. He even wanted to join hands with Bai Yuchen to kill Lin Yun, but he was severed in two before he could even attack.

But death might not be the worst situation since they could have been crippled. Bai Yuchen was trembling in fear as he watched Lin Yun approaching him. He could sense his strength being drained from his legs and his trembled incessantly.

He wanted to admit defeat, but he couldn’t move his lips. However, no one laughed and the crowd looked at him with sympathy. They knew that they would look even more terrible if they were in his position.

Bai Yuchen could feel his scalp tingling as the person that was talking to him a second ago was severed into two.

But Lin Yun suddenly came to a stop as he turned to look at the judge, “I’ve already won, right?”

His voice wasn’t loud, but it rumbled throughout the mountain like thunder that dragged everyone back to reality.

“Indeed, he has already won…”

“Bai Yuchen can’t even admit defeat. He has embarrassed the Flowing Cloud Academy and the Azurewood Pavilion.”

“You can’t blame him. Anyone in his position would react the same way.”

“Lin Yun was too brutal. Bai Yuchen ended up in a miserable state. At least he didn’t suffer the same way that the White Jade Academy did. Their loss was a true tragedy. This should be the first time Hell Mode was a success in the Five Academies’ Competition. With this battle, the Heavenly Province Academy’s position would be stabilized even if Lin Yun loses in tomorrow’s fight.”

“That's right. Reputation is the most important for a force and Lin Yun’s battle cleansed the Heavenly Province Academy of their humiliation two decades ago.” Everyone began to whisper with each other after they recovered from their shock.

But there were still people who were dumbfounded. There weren’t many people who could be compared to Bai Yuchen, Cao Xiu, Chen Yu, or Luo Shen. But all of them were defeated by Flower Burial Lin Yun.

There was no doubt that this battle would make the name Flower Burial resound throughout the Nether Prefecture.

As the judge of the competition, the elderly man had a decent ability in the Nether Prefectural City in terms of his eyesight and experience. But even he couldn’t help being shocked by the outcome of this battle.

He only glanced at Bai Yuchen briefly before his gaze was fixed on Lin Yun. It took a while, but he finally announced the outcome of the battle, “Lin Yun wins this battle! The Heavenly Province Academy has succeeded in Hell Mode!”

Everyone from the White Jade Academy had dark faces. They had already won, but it was overruled with Hell Mode. So anyone could imagine how they were feeling right now. Furthermore, Luo Shen, Chen Yu, and even the Blackflame Sect’s Cao Xiu had died. This was a great loss, which would lead to their total collapse.

“Damn it, who the hell is this brat? Why was he so ruthless to our White Jade Academy?”

“Where did this person come from? Are you people idiots? How can you guys not have any information on someone like him?!”

“Investigate his origin! We have to take revenge no matter what!” An elder of the White Jade Academy roared furiously because he wanted to tear Lin Yun apart.

On the other hand, everyone from the Heavenly Province Academy had smiles on their faces. But they only cheered after the outcome of the battle was announced.

“We won!”

“We succeeded in Hell Mode!”

“Twenty years! We have finally been cleansed of our humiliation!” Everyone felt the burden of humiliation disappear because Lin Yun taught the White Jade Academy a brutal lesson.

“Big Sister Mo, we won! Lin Yun really won…” Liu Yunyan couldn’t contain her emotions anymore as he burst into tears. Her emotions were out of control at this moment.

Embracing Liu Yunyan, Mo Ling smiled, “Don’t cry.”

Liu Yunyan managed to contain her emotions a long time later and she blushed when she recalled how she had acted. But when he raised her head to look at the youth on the stage, she smiled, “Big Sister Mo, look. Lin Yun seems different at this moment.”

“Is that so?” Mo Ling turned to look at Lin Yun sheathing his sword. He had shown a brutal side of him that he never showed in the Heavenly Province Academy.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun returned to the Heavenly Province Academy’s party. When he landed, Tang Yu and the other elders came up to him with smiles, “Are you injured?”

“Some light injuries, but it’s fine,” replied Lin Yun.

“That’s good. You might have a chance if you can face Cao Zhen in your top form,” said Tang Yu as his eyes lit up. Lin Yun had cleansed the Heavenly Province Academy of the humiliation they suffered two decades ago.

As an outside helper, Lin Yun’s performance was perfect. Even if he lost the fight tomorrow, there would be no damage to the Heavenly Province Academy’s reputation. As for the incomplete divine rune, they could always get it back in the future competitions. So this was a perfect outcome. After all, Cao Zhen could be in the greater Yang stage, so the odds of Lin Yun winning weren't high.

“I’ll fight Cao Zhen tomorrow?” asked Lin Yun.

Tang Yu stroked his beard and smiled, “Yeah. It should be the next round, but you can rest for the night since you’ve gone through Hell Mode. This is a rule set a long time ago, but you’re the first person who actually succeeded in the challenge.”

“But you can’t let your guard down against Cao Zhen. Cao Zhen isn’t like Bai Yuchen. He is a monstrous genius that the Northern Snow Manor is nurturing,” said Mo Ling as she came over.

Right at this moment, just as everyone was about to leave, a terrifying aura began to boil and instantly enveloped the entire mountain. When everyone turned their heads, they saw the frail youth who had been meditating right from the start releasing a cold aura from his body.

“Cao Zhen!” The atmosphere suddenly became stiff when everyone saw that the aura came from Cao Zhen. Clearly, he had something to say.

When Cao Zhen opened his eyes, he stared in one direction. More accurately speaking, he was looking at Lin Yun.

Sensing the gaze, Lin Yun raised his head and looked back at Cao Zhen. This person had finally looked at him straight for once. He still remembered how Cao Zhen had ignored everyone and only focused on meditating as if this competition had nothing to do with him. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Cao Zhen’s cold gaze suddenly became a little warmer as he said, “I’ll wait for you tomorrow!”
