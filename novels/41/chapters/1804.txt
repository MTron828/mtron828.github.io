Chapter 1805 - Black Tortoise Ship

The Black Tortoise Void Sea was located at the far west of the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea, and was far away from Heavenly Domain City. Even without mentioning the twists and turns of the dangers, it would take half a month, even for a Samsara Edict Realm expert, to fly over.

Furthermore, cultivators needed to rest. If they ran into some trouble, they would have to take an even longer time. This was the reason why they could only rely on a saint-class warship to travel.

A saint-class warship was a powerful saint artifact. At full power, it could even unleash a power comparable to a saint. Only the Mo Clan and Sacred Alliance knew how to forge a saint-class warship. So other forces, including the Divine Dragon Empire, could only buy from them.

Then again, it wasn’t easy to forge a saint-class warship. It would need hundreds of years to forge, consuming immeasurable resources in the process. When the saint-class warship took off from the port, it flew to the clouds and continued to climb.

In the end, the saint-class warship broke through eighteen layers of heaven before it stopped rising. The Kunlun Realm had thirty-six layers of heaven. With three layers being heaven, it could also be called nine heavens.

The eighteenth layer was equivalent to the sixth heaven, and the environment here was harsh. Even those at the Profound Life Stage wouldn’t be able to stay here for long. The entire warship was surrounded by an energy barrier, looking like a huge fireball and emitting a powerful radiance.

The radiance was dazzling, and no astral beasts dared to attack the ship at the sixth heaven. This also meant that the journey that should take half a month would only take less than a day.

When the saint-class warship broke through heaven once more, it arrived on an island. This was the Profound Spirit Island, and the Sacred Alliance’s stronghold was built here. The Sacred Alliance was a special existence in the Kunlun Realm. They were absolutely neutral, and no one knew about their origin. But there was no question that the Sacred Alliance was extremely powerful, and no one dared to provoke them.

There was a powerful spiritual array enveloping the entire island that totaled a hundred and one layers. So even if a holy land attacked this stronghold, it would take some time for them to break through the arrays.

As an upcurrent blew up, the saint-class warship landed on the Profound Spiritual Island’s port.

“We’re here. Everyone can find the Black Tortoise Ship after disembarking. It will bring you to the Black Tortoise Void Sea. The space in that region isn’t stable, and only the Black Tortoise Ship can remember the sailing route. If you go alone and anything happens to you, the Sacred Alliance won’t be responsible for what happens.” An elder from the Sacred Alliance said. “The Black Tortoise Ship will set sail when eight golden slips are gathered, and it will set sail automatically. When you guys return, the Black Tortoise Ship will bring you guys back, and we will check your golden slip when you return. So please remember to abide by the rules and don’t casually disembark!”

The golden slip was equivalent to a ticket, and the value of a golden slip was a hundred and fifty thousand Divine Astral Pellets.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

There were roughly six thousand people on the saint-class warship, so this meant the Sacred Alliance would make six hundred million Divine Astral Pellets from this alone. Then again, the saint-class warship would also have to consume saint crystals as energy. So only the Sacred Alliance would know how much they could earn.

There was a stone tablet when they got down, and they had to verify the authenticity of the golden slips through it.

“Young Master, Lin Xiao has disappeared!” An elder from the Liu Saint Clan said.

“What’s going on?” The Wind Edge Lord furiously roared. “Don’t let him run!”

Lin Yun was still reading the bamboo scroll just a moment ago, but he suddenly disappeared. When they looked around, Lin Yun was already in front of the stone tablet while they were stuck in the crowded flow of people.

The Wind Edge Lord looked annoyed, but he didn’t dare to move after glancing at the guards on the warship because the Sacred Alliance wasn’t easy to deal with. On the contrary, Kou Tianhu, Yuan Hengying, and Lady Stone were fairly calm.

Lin Yun scanned his golden slip on the stone tablet before he quickly disembarked and walked to the other side of the port. There were complete tortoiseshells by the shore floating on the water, and there were saint runes engraved on the surface of the shell. These were the Black Tortoise Ships.

Lin Yun casually jumped onto one, and it didn’t take long for three people to come on. It takes eight people to activate their golden slips to move the ship, so they weren’t in a hurry.

Soon, there were seven people gathered in the Black Tortoise Ship. They only needed one more person.

“Wait for me! I have yet to board the ship!” A figure ran over. Mei Zihua lightly gasped for breath and jumped onto the Black Tortoise Ship. The moment he jumped on, everyone activated their golden slips, and the Black Tortoise Ship shot out like an arrow.

“That was close. I nearly missed it.” Mei Zihua wiped the sweat on his forehead and sat on the tortoiseshell with a smile.

“He escaped!”

“Chase after him!” The Wind Edge Lord became furious, and they jumped onto another Black Tortoise Ship to activate it. But their Black Tortoise Ship remained motionless, and this naturally made them furiously stomp their feet because they could only watch as Lin Yun slowly disappeared from their sight.

“Young Master, we need to gather eight people before it can move.” The Liu Saint Clan’s elder said anxiously.

“Why didn’t you tell me earlier?!” The Wind Edge Lord glared at this elder, so the elder kept his mouth shut. The Sacred Alliance made themselves clear, but the Wind Edge Lord was the one who didn’t listen to it.

The setting sun was like blood, and the sea was boundless. This was a magnificent scenery as the Black Tortoise Ship rode the waves and slowly approached the Black Tortoise Void Sea. There were eight people on this ship. Aside from Lin Yun and Mei Zihua, the remaining six were five men and one woman.

Since Lin Yun now had a bounty on his head by the Demonfeather Order, he naturally had to examine them well. Amongst them, there were three who were friends often coming to the Black Tortoise Void Sea to hunt saint crystals. So Lin Yun was practically certain they were harmless. The leader of this party was Chen Tong, who used to be a disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect until he left when he became old.

This was commonly seen amongst sects because once a person exceeds a certain age, they would lose their value to be nurtured by the sect. If they still wanted to stay in the sect, they could either be a deacon or become the leader of a subsidiary force.

If it was in the Sword Sect, those reaching the Profound Life Stage could stay behind to become an elder, and the treatment of an elder wasn’t at all inferior to some disciples. But the Heavenly Dao Sect was once the strongest holy land in the Eastern Desolation, so they naturally had a stricter requirement. The Profound Life Stage could only allow him to be a deacon, at best. It was natural that this person wasn’t willing and left the stage.

The remaining three were pretty suspicious. One was dressed in black clothes with his face covered. Only his eyes were exposed, and he wore his bamboo hat after boarding the Black Tortoise Ship, which made him look even more suspicious. When he boarded the ship, his gaze was on Lin Yun for a long time, as if he was confirming something.

The second person was an old man, dressed like a beggar with tattered clothes and gave off a stench. He was sitting there, drinking his wine, and minding his own business.

The last woman was the weirdest because she was too beautiful. She had delicate and bewitching features, donning a white dress embroidered with golden threads. Looking at her, this woman reminded him of a grown-up version of Yue Weiwei. She shared an uncanny resemblance with Yue Weiwei’s temperament, it’s just that she was older and had a noble temperament.

This was a pretty high evaluation because there weren’t many people in this world who were as beautiful as Yue Weiwei. But this person was comparable to her, it’s just that they each have different temperaments.

At the forefront of the Black Tortoise Ship, Mei Zihua was in a pretty good mood as he played his flute by the wind. The melody he played was beautiful and grand. Everyone was soon engrossed in it without knowing it.

“Brother Lin, why don’t you play something? You’re the champion of the Nirvana Banquet, and you’re definitely not at all inferior to him.” Cheng Tong smiled.

His two companions also looked pretty excited and said, “Brother Lin, play something.”

As for the man with a bamboo hat and the woman, they also turned their attention over. But Lin Yun shook his head and replied, “The Black Tortoise Void Sea is strange, and music might attract the unknown.”

“We have yet to reach the Black Tortoise Void Sea, so you don’t have to be worried.” Cheng Tong smiled.

“A flower only blooms for a tree. This is a rare opportunity, and I’m curious about how breathtaking the Nirvana Banquet’s champion’s music must be.” The woman smiled.

But Lin Yun merely glanced at her and shook his head.

When Mei Zihua heard what everyone said, he was unhappy and raised the sound of his melody. This instantly captivated everyone’s attention, and a voice resounded from afar, responding to his melody.

This made Mei Zihua even more excited, and he became even more focused on his melody. A brief moment later, he lowered his flute and excitedly said, “Lin Xiao, someone is responding to my melody, and it might be a beauty. Why don’t we go and take a look?”

But the faces of Cheng Tong and the others gradually changed because this voice sounded like the legendary Ghost Mermaid.

“Holy shit, what the hell…” Mei Zihua suddenly shivered, and saw a transparent woman in the water at the far end. She had crimson eyes and was enveloped in resentment. She instantly captivated everyone’s attention, and they could feel a chill running down their spines.

“It’s the Ghost Mermaid, also commonly known as ghost mermen.” Lin Yun said. In ancient times, there were mermen living in the unholy sea, and their tears were treasures. Thus, many mermen were being hunted by the other races.

After their death, their resentment lingered and formed into a vengeful spirit as time passed. Their song could lure people over before devouring their souls. They were a form of terrifying monsters in the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

Even someone at the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage wasn’t willing to face them. Their appearance made the faces of Cheng Tong and the others pale. Since they were often here, they naturally knew how terrifying the mermen were.

Most importantly, they were vengeful spirits with no physique. So many means were ineffective against them. But they wouldn’t be tough to deal with if there was a spiritualist here.

Cheng Tong and the others turned to look at Mei Zihua with resentment. Not only did the latter play his flute, but he just had to show off and lure so many mermen over.

“We won’t be able to escape. There are too many of them.” Cheng Tong muttered.

But the woman didn’t panic, and wore a deep smile, “This young master’s flute skill is too high. I bet those mermaid sisters love it.”

“Lin Xiao, what should we do now?” Mei Zihua turned to look at Lin Yun. He didn’t have time to waste with the woman now.

“You lured them over, so you deal with them.” Lin Yun replied indifferently.

“Lin Xiao, aren’t you being a little too ruthless?” Mei Zihua complained.

“Firstly, you’re the one who lured them over. Secondly, you have the strongest mental energy amongst us, so only you can resolve the problem you created.” Lin Yun said. When he glanced at Mei Zihua, it made the latter feel a chill run down his spine.

“You’re ruthless!” Mei Zihua still had a sense of responsibility. He swiftly soared to the sky before playing the flute and luring the mermen away.
