Chapter 2410 - Curtain Falls

Lin Yun soared to the sky, facing three Eternal Daos head-on with two dao flowers behind him. This put Feng Yuan, Bai Yuchen, and Jiang Yi under tremendous pressure. After all, Lin Yun had grasped two Eternal Daos. This had exceeded everyone’s imagination, not to mention the three of them.

Lin Yun’s Sword Dao was strong enough, and he could even suppress Truth Dao with his sword. But no one expected that he had grasped two Eternal Daos!

Feng Yuan, Bai Yuchen, and Jiang Yi felt their scalps becoming numb with disbelief. But before they could respond, Lin Yun charged forth, giving off a powerful aura that made them feel suffocating. Fine cracks also appeared on their auras, showing signs that they would explode the next second.

The three of them were peerless geniuses, and they knew that they couldn’t panic at this moment. They adjusted their mindset and exchanged gazes before Feng Yuan stood out. He was the strongest amongst the three, and he wouldn’t be heavily injured even if he couldn’t withstand Lin Yun’s attacks.

Lin Yun and Feng Yuan exchanged a palm in the sky, causing a huge explosion with a shockwave sweeping out that made everyone nervous. When they clashed, Feng Yuan’s Yin-Yang Painting collapsed and he threw out a mouthful of blood, falling to the ground with his foot deeply planted into the stage with cracks spreading out. It was soon followed by an explosion that caused countless rocks to fly around.

Throwing out a mouthful of blood, Feng Yuan’s face became pale. But he wore a smile because he suffered no injuries despite losing in the clash. As for Lin Yun, he gently landed with one hand on the rock, looking at the three coldly.

“It looks like there’s nothing impressive about having two Eternal Daos.” Feng Yuan wiped the blood off his lips, and smiled, “Or did you only just enter the threshold with Nirvana Dao? Experience the martial techniques of the Dao Sect!”

Feng Yuan’s confidence was boosted since he wasn’t heavily injured in that clash. When he soared to the sky, he disappeared and appeared on the vast rock Lin Yun was on.

“Nine Profound Golden Physique—Heavenly Saint Armor!” Feng Yuan roared with a golden radiance shining from him as he brought out the Dao Sect’s divine body-refining technique.

After they had exchanged ten moves, they retreated a few hundred meters away from each other. Feng Yuan’s forehead was covered in sweat, and anyone could tell that exchange was taxing for him. But he continued accumulating energy and made the Heavenly Saint Armor even more terrifying.

Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi also took this opportunity to charge over, wanting to avoid giving Lin Yun a chance to catch his breath.

Facing them, Lin Yun performed the Yin-Yang Fist and faced the two of them, holding his ground. But Feng Yuan charged while Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi held Lin Yun down. Lin Yun had expected it, but he couldn’t take the attack that Feng Yuan had accumulated for a long time.

When Lin Yun was sent flying away, he smashed apart all the rocks before he stopped.

“Kill!” Feng Yuan, Bai Yuchen, and Jiang Yi became more confident, wanting to take this opportunity to suppress Lin Yun.

“Great!” Lin Yun laughed as his clothes and hair began to flutter in the wind. The Flower Burial Sword began to tremble before it returned to Lin Yun’s hand, which he then swung at the incoming three.

This made Feng Yuan, Bai Yuchen, and Jiang Yi’s faces change as they felt a chill run down their spines. They quickly stopped and ducked.

Standing on the hovering rock, Lin Yun flicked his finger and the Flower Burial Sword flew out. The nine thousand ribbons also soared to the sky while Lin Yun controlled his sword from afar, forcing the three to retreat. The Flower Burial Sword manifested into tens of thousands of swords that were under Lin Yun’s control.

This made Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi’s faces pale as they continuously had a tough time holding their ground. Only Feng Yuan maintained his composure, using the Heavenly Saint Armor to withstand the attacks from the Flower Burial Sword. He only had to protect his vitals as the sword rays descended.

This scene left all the spectators dumbfounded as this battle became too exciting. They were shocked when they saw five Eternal Daos from the four of them. This should be the strongest battle beneath Saint Sovereigns, and they were all peerless geniuses. Hence, they didn’t want to miss any detail of this battle since there was a lot they could learn from.

Did I fight this person to a draw? Dugu Jue lost his confidence with lingering fear. He felt fortunate that he didn’t promise Lin Yun to fight again.

Feng Yuan finally made his move on the stage, clamping on the Flower Burial Sword with unbelievable speed. The Flower Burial Sword began to vibrate as a powerful sword aura came crashing down on Feng Yuan, and the latter let out a groan before holding his ground. There was an invisible current sweeping out that made him feel as though he wasn’t holding onto the sword but a ferocious dragon.

“Kill!” Jiang Yi and Bai Yuchen took this opportunity to soar to the sky with their dao flowers blooming. This shocked everyone because the situation became disadvantageous to Lin Yun once more.

Lin Yun was calm as he looked at the Flower Burial Sword, wanting to recall it. When he poured his sword intent into it, Feng Yuan looked like he was struggling, but he gritted his teeth and held on.

Under the stalemate, Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi soon approached. This made everyone’s hearts sink because Lin Yun didn’t have his sword with him, so how would he face Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi?

Right then, Lin Yun raised his right hand, and the flower representing Nirvana Dao revolved as flames blazed in Lin Yun’s eyes. When he took a step forward, the time-space barrier shattered with the entire world trembling while he returned to the previous moment when Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi didn’t move, and Feng Yuan clamped onto the Flower Burial Sword.

With a flash, he tapped on Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi’s chest before coming over to Feng Yuan, using his fingers to chop off the latter’s right hand. When he was done, a powerful force dragged him back to reality, and the flames in his eyes dissipated. The dao flower behind him crumbled as well.

When the Nirvana Dao dissipated, only the Yin-Yang Dao remained. A hole appeared in Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi’s chests as they fell from the sky like broken kites. Feng Yuan was in an even more severe condition, with his right hand severed while the Flower Burial Sword returned to Lin Yun’s hand.

Everything took place in the blink of an eye, and Lin Yun only waved his hand to inflict heavy injuries on Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi while severing Feng Yuan’s hand. When he held onto the Flower Burial Sword again, everything had ended.

As he landed on the ground with the Flower Burial, the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage had crumbled. Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi were lying on the ground, unable to get up. As for Feng Yuan, his face was terrifyingly pale, with one hand severed and kneeling on the floor.

“So... do you guys still want to bring me back?” Lin Yun asked. Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi were in so much pain that they couldn’t speak. As for Feng Yuan, he was so ashamed that he didn’t dare to look Lin Yun in the eyes.

“Thanks for the drum, Emperor. I didn’t disappoint, and I believe I have won,” Lin Yun smiled at the surprised Luo Tianxi.

Luo Tianxi came to his senses, and he could naturally tell that the battle had come to an end. He sighed, “Everything is nothing before Nirvana... You will really become a genius who will suppress an entire generation now. It’s also time to end this mess.

“Bai Yuchen, Jiang Yi, and Feng Yuan!” Luo Tianxi’s face became cold, and he continued, “The three of you have intruded Heaven’s Gate and messed up the banquet. It’s time for us to deal with this now.”

The faces of Bai Yuchen, Jiang Yi, and Feng Yuan changed.

“Profound Sky Venerable!” Luo Tianxi called out.

“I’m here!” Profound Sky Venerable replied.

“Lock them up in the Blood Purgatory Ruins, and no one is allowed to release them, even if an Ancestral Stage expert comes!” Luo Tianxi said coldly.

Feng Yuan, Jiang Yi, and Bai Yuchen collapsed with despair on their faces. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Everyone took a deep breath and was shocked. After all, the three of them were arrogant when they came, but they had become the prisoner of Heaven’s Gate now.

Luo Tianxi wouldn’t make a move against a junior, even if they mocked and humiliated Heaven’s Gate. But since Lin Yun defeated them, they couldn’t blame him for being ruthless now.
