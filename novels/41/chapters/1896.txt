Chapter 1897 - Difficulties

“Senior Brother, you don’t seem to be surprised by this matter,” Chen Feng asked with puzzlement when he saw Lin Yun’s expression.

The reason why he smiled was because he was the mastermind who hung Zhang Yue on the tree. So how would he be shocked by something he did?

“Those who humiliate naturally have to be prepared to be humiliated. He deserved it, so why would I be surprised? Let’s go and look at him,” Lin Yun said indifferently, and he led the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples to the Profound Maiden Courtyard.

“How was he discovered?” He asked.

“Hehe, that’s a coincidence. He was discovered by a disciple passing by, not by the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples.”

“That person wanted to remove him from the tree, but Zhang Yue had a restriction placed on him, and he yelled not to let anyone touch him,” the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples shared.

“Oh?” Lin Yun feigned not to know about this matter.

“That’s true. Even a Quasi-Saint can’t do anything about it. When the Profound Maiden Courtyard was opened, this matter was instantly known to everyone within the Heavenly Dao Sect in less than half an incense of time.”

“Senior Brother, hurry up, or we won’t have space to watch.” The Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples urged.

It was just as they said. The surroundings were filled with people when they came to the Profound Maiden Courtyard. Everyone from the two palaces, three courtyards, and a hundred and eight peaks was here. The Profound Maiden Courtyard’s gates couldn’t be compared to the Heavenly Dao Altar, so this place was packed with people.

Lin Yun’s group found a spot and saw Zhang Yue hanging naked on an ancient tree by a rope.

“It’s really Senior Brother Zhang Yue!”

“Hahaha, look at the tortoise doodle on his face! Hahaha!”

“Wait, words are written on Senior Brother Zhang Yue’s back!” Someone spoke out.

“‘I’m sinful and shouldn’t have peeked on the Dragon Origin Great Saint showering.’”

“Hahaha, are you serious?!”

“Hehe, Senior Brother Zhang is completely exposed… It turns out to be so small…”

“Hahaha!” Everyone laughed aloud because this scene was too interesting, and they could not endure it.

“Stop laughing! All of you, stop laughing!” The Dao Yang Palace’s disciples around Zhang Yue roared with their faces pale.

“What’s the matter? He peeked at the Dragon Origin Great Saint showering, and we can’t talk about it?”

“Those from the Dao Yang Palace really have a fiery temper.”

“Heh, a saint’s disciple? He’s still stripped and hung on a tree. Wasn’t he awe-inspiring yesterday?” Those who the Dao Yang Palace usually bullied spoke up.

“Quick, get me down!” Zhang Yue struggled on the tree with shame on his face.

“Hehe, it’s him!” Right then, the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s gate opened, and a series of chuckles resounded as the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples came out. They already couldn’t hold back their curiosity a long time ago, but they had reservations before because of their master.

“He’s really stripped naked.”

“Speaking of which, don’t you think that Senior Brother Zhang’s butt is really white and round?”

“So small…”

“Hahaha!” The Profound Maiden Courtyard’s female disciples were a lot bolder and would occasionally sneak a peek before discussing amongst themselves.

“Cover me up!” Zhang Yue said with shame covering his face.

“Senior Brother, we can’t touch you. If we do, the shackles on you will break, and your life will be in danger. The elders have already gone to look for a saint. So bear with it for now,” the Dao Yang Palace’s disciples helplessly said.

The few Quasi-Saints who came were so furious that they wanted to throw out a mouthful of blood while looking at Zhang Yue. But they discovered that they couldn’t touch Zhang Yue at all or cover him up. Thus, they could only return to the Dao Yang Palace and invite a Saint Elder.

“The Dao Yang Palace’s Saint Elder is here!” Someone exclaimed.

Right then, three figures enveloped in saint aura descended from the sky. They all donned blue robes, and the one leading was the Saint Elder of the Dao Yang Palace, Tu You, also known as the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign.

“Master, save me!” Zhang Yue yelled upon seeing the Saint Elder.

“Tu You, your Dao Yang Palace better give me an explanation for what happened today. Hanging in front of my Profound Maiden Courtyard’s gate buck naked. What are you guys trying to do?” Before Saint Elder Tu You was going to make a move, a woman came out from the Profound Maiden Courtyard.

“Serene Dust Great Saint!” An exclamation resounded from the surroundings, and everyone became quiet. The Serene Dust Great Saint was notorious within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and she had crippled a few saint’s disciples in the past. She was infamous for her brutality.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Ye Xinyan was standing beside her, and she soon discovered Ye Qingtian, who was amongst the crowd. But the other party seemed to be avoiding her by shifting his gaze away the moment their eyes bumped. She discovered that Ye Qigntian wasn’t like the rumors, making her fall into deep thoughts.

Saint Elder Tu You wore an awkward expression, and said, “Serene Dust Great Saint, someone is clearly behind this. Zhang Yue is my disciple, and I believe he won’t do something as humiliating as this.”

“Last night, an intruder was discovered by the patrolling elders, and I suspect that person did this.” This matter concerned the face of the Dao Yang Palace, and Saint Elder Tu You could only toughen his scalp despite the fury blazing within his pupils.

“Master, save me! I’m innocent!” Zhang Yue yelled from the tree.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched within the crowd. Everyone knew that someone had done this to Zhang Yue, but that wouldn’t affect Zhang Yue becoming a laughingstock within the Heavenly Dao Sect. Zhang Yue was ranked within the top ten amongst the saint disciples in the Dao Yang Palace, possessing the Flamespirit Saint Physique. This meant that he had excellent prospects ahead of him.

But the fact that he was humiliated in this way proved that he was a piece of garbage. Thus, despite his talent, he was destined to become a laughingstock within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Lin Yun wore a faint smile as he watched from the crowd.

“Serene Dust Great Saint, I’ll investigate this matter well and give the Profound Maiden Courtyard an explanation,” the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign said. Before the Serene Dust Great Saint said anything, the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign released an outburst of saint aura before reaching out with his finger.

Crimson threads also appeared on Zhang Yue’s body. When the threads appeared, the Serene Dust Great Saint and Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign reached out, grabbing a portion of the crimson threads.

“The Soul Locking Threads… This is an ancient method. Zhang Yue, what happened last night, and who did you offend?” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign asked coldly.

Zhang Yue was putting on clothes and quickly replied, “Master, I was cultivating last night within the Dao Yang Palace the whole time. I was already hanging on the tree when I woke up.”

His reply made the Serene Dust Great Saint’s face sink with a cold light flashing across her pupils. But just when she was about to make a move, the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign slapped Zhang Yue, and he roared, “How dare you lie before the Serene Dust Great Saint! If you stayed within the Dao Yang Palace the whole time, no one could bring you away without causing a commotion!”

He was signaling to Zhang Yue that the Serene Dust Great Saint hated liars the most, and Zhang Yue would lose at least a limb if the Serene Dust Great Saint made a move.

The slap made half of Zhang Yue’s face swollen, and tears rolled down his cheeks. Most importantly, a Great Saint and a Saint Sovereign’s attention was on him, and the pressure they gave off nearly made him collapse. In the end, Zhang Yue looked at the Nether Azure Saint Sovereign and begged, “Master, I have my difficulties. Can I tell you about it when we get back?”

“Speak!” The Serene Dust Great Saint said without any expression on her face. When she roared, she gave off a powerful saint aura that made Zhang Yue throw out a mouthful of blood, making his face pale. But even when facing immense pressure, Zhang Yue still gritted his teeth and said nothing.

The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s eyes flickered. He sensed that there must be a story, and his face changed.

“Tu You, your disciple is pretty stubborn to keep his mouth shut even when I asked him to speak!” The Serene Dust Great Saint turned to coldly look at the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign.

Facing the Serene Dust Great Saint’s unhappiness, the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign could only toughen his scalp and said, “Zhang Yue, speak up. With me around, you don’t have to be afraid of anything.”

“I… I… I have my difficulties…” Zhang Yue was on the verge of crying and lowered his head.
