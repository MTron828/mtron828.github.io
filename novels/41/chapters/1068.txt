Chapter 1069 - Final Battle

The crimson bolt was filled with a violent aura that created ripples on the surface of the lake. The fluctuation on the surface of the lake was so strong that everyone started to pay attention to what was going on. When they looked carefully, they realized that it was a Dragon Blooded Horse and not lightning.

Since the horse moved so fast, it gave others the impression that it was a bolt of lightning. Who would have thought that a familiar figure would be descending front he back of the Dragon Blooded Horse? The youth donned in azure clothes with a purple mark on his forehead was back.

“Lin Yun!” Everyone in Saint Spiritual Lake was shocked when they saw Lin Yun. Even the nine Realm Sons couldn’t help looking at Lin Yun in shock.

They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun was here. After all, the entrance of the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm was closed, so Lin Yun should still be trapped. After all, even the elders of the powerful sects couldn’t forcibly open the entrance to the forbidden realm.

Under the Heavenly Path Mirror in the starry sky, the elders from the various sects were rejoicing at the sight of Lin Yun.

“This brat really has great fortune to make it out of the forbidden realm. Absolutely brilliant!”

“He even made it on time for the final battle. Haha, he belongs to us, the Thunder Sect!”

“Hmph, the Thunder Sect might be known for its offensive capabilities, but you guys aren’t proficient in the way of swords. My Flying Snow Manor is more suitable in this sense.”

“This brat has a strong physique. He can come to my Sky Net Sect.” All of the elders became excited when they saw Lin Yun. Only one elder had a sunken face, Elder Jin Jue from the Profound Sky Sect.

He smiled, “There’s no need to compete over him since he’s destined to die. After all, there’s no point in fighting over a dead person.”

The other elders were briefly stunned when they heard Elder Jin Jue. They knew that Elder Jin Jue had a deep relationship with the saint clan in the Nether Divinity War Realm. Since Lin Yun had a deep grudge with the Nether Divinity Realm Son, Elder Jin Jue was naturally unhappy with Lin Yun’s appearance. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Profound Sky Sect was a super powerhouse in the Ancient Barren Domain. So the elders weren’t sure if they would provoke the enmity of the Profound Sky Sect if they recruited Lin Yun. Still, they had to fight for Lin Yun on the surface.

While the elders were discussing, the Saint Spiritual Lake exploded because Lin Yun descended like a sharp sword on top of the surface of the water.

“Brother Lin!” Qin Lin and his group were briefly stunned upon seeing Lin Yun. But they soon thought of something and their faces changed. “Lin Yun, you have to be careful. The Nether Divinity Realm Son reached the sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm and he has a total of ten Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans.”

Lin Yun’s appearance made them rejoice, but they began to worry about his safety. After basking in the Saint Spiritual Lake, the Nether Divinity Realm Son had undergone a drastic transformation while Lin Yun was trapped in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm and hadn’t basked in the Saint Spiritual Lake.

They didn’t think that Lin Yun was qualified to face any of the Realm Sons anymore.

When Lin Yun heard their words, he turned to look at them. Then, when he saw Luo Chen’s face, rage filled his mind. Luo Chen’s face was swollen and he looked like a bloody mess.

“Who did that?” Lin Yun asked. However, Luo Chen merely shook his head and refused to reply.

“Qin Lin, please speak.” Lin Yun didn’t force Luo Chen to reply and turned to look at Qin Lin. However, Qin Lin didn’t say a word when he saw an eye signal from Luo Chen.

Everyone knew that Lin Yun would lose it if they told him what happened.

Qin Lin wasn’t stupid and he knew that Luo Chen didn’t want Lin Yun’s mindset to be affected. If that happened, Lin Yun wouldn’t have a chance in the final battle.

“Hahaha, tell him how I humiliated that piece of trash and how that piece of trash kneeled to me. I want Lin Yun to hear how much he begged me to let you all go. Tell him that I slapped the face of that piece of trash!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son suddenly burst out in laughter.

He was happy that Lin Yun came. After all, he wouldn’t be able to repay the humiliation Lin Yun gave him if he couldn’t get revenge. Becoming the champion would be meaningless without revenge.

After all, it wasn’t as satisfying to slap Luo Chen’s face if he could slap Lin Yun. The Nether Divinity Realm Son continued to speak, “Tell him how terrible you all felt when Luo Chen knelt before me! Tell him how Luo Chen begged me to slap his face!”

Qin Lin’s face was ugly because the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s words were too nasty. He was humiliating all of them without any reservation. However, as much as Qin Lin hated those words, they were the truth. All of them were garbage who could only watch Luo Chen humiliate himself.

On top of that, the Nether Divinity Realm Son tricked them. The Nether Divinity Realm Son never had any intentions of letting them go. The Nether Divinity Realm Son began to laugh while the Saint Spiritual Lake fell into silence.

Everyone was looking at Lin Yun with pity in their eyes. So what if Lin Yun came back? There was nothing he could do about this situation since the Realm Sons already went through the baptism of the Saint Spiritual Lake.

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t care what people were thinking. After all, he was in a foul mood. He couldn’t stand the fact that his friends were suffering on his behalf. He was enraged that the Nether Divinity Realm Son targeted his friends instead of him.

Lin Yun swept his glance at the Nether Divinity Realm Son with a boundless killing aura that made the entire Saint Spiritual Lake tremble.

“Is this fellow insane? Doesn’t he know that the Nether Divinity Realm Son is in the sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm with ten Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans?” Everyone looked at Lin Yun with doubt. Could it be that he wanted to repeat his legend from Wind Mound City?

“Sever one of your arms and I will give you an easy death in the final battle!” Lin Yun barked. His words made the hearts of everyone sink because Lin Yun was still as arrogant as before. He must have no idea how powerful the Saint Spiritual Lake was because the two of them were no longer on the same level.

Right at this moment, various phenomena began to appear as the surrounding space became heavy. When everyone took a deep breath, they could sense their blood boiling. Golden droplets were rising out of the water to signify the start of the final battle.

But no one moved because all eyes were on Lin Yun and the Nether Divinity Realm Son. The battle shouldn’t have any suspense, but for some reason, no one could look away.

“Break an arm?” Lin Yun’s words stunned the Nether Divinity Realm Son. It was like he just heard the biggest joke of the century as he laughed with disdain, “Hahaha! Lin Yun, do you really think you can repeat what you did in Wind Mound City? Let me tell you, I’m a lot stronger than you can imagine. Now, I’m going to make you regret being born!”

“Three moves. I’ll destroy you within three moves!” Lin Yun said.

His words made the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s face turn black because he was in the sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm with ten Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans. He hated Lin Yun’s arrogance because it reminded him of Wind Mound City.

“You’re courting death!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son flew into a rage, unleashing his cultivation in the sixth soul in a split second. Very quickly, his figure began to blur as his hand was about to land on Lin Yun’s head. He wanted to suppress Lin Yun and make the latter beg for mercy.

“You imbecile, kneel!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son barked as his voice radiated. He appeared before Lin Yun so fast that others could barely see what was going on.

But Lin Yun suddenly raised his head with a dazzling light shining brightly from his pupils. The Nether Divinity Realm Son felt his scalp go numb. He couldn’t believe that this gaze belonged to someone in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

When the Nether Divinity Realm Son recovered from his shock, fear flickered in his eyes. Then, a resounding slap rang out sending the Nether Divinity Realm Son flying like a spinning top.

After the first slap, Lin Yun took out a napkin to wipe his hand and said, “First move!”
