Chapter 718 - Invincible

As the disdainful voice echoed in everyone’s ears, the crowd was taken aback that Lin Yun would be so arrogant. His words made the faces of the seven geniuses change because a sword slave actually dared to provoke them head-on, especially Chen Ziyu. He had already taken a huge step back, but Lin Yun had completely ignored it.

Not only that, Lin Yun words also made the faces of the demonic cultivators change because they were also included in Lin Yun’s mocking words.

“A lowly sword slave like you dares to be so arrogant? I’ll kill you!” Jin Yi finally couldn’t hold it back anymore as he soared into the sky. This time, Chen Ziyu didn’t stop him. If Jin Yi didn’t make a move, he would have.

Flames blazed around Jin Yi into armor. From afar, he looked like a flaming war god as he emitted a terrifying aura. Golden Thorn Flowers also began to appear around him as each flower emitted an immense power.

“It’s Jin Yi!” The crowd couldn’t see Jin Yi clearly, but there were those who recognized his cultivation technique. This couldn’t help leaving them shocked because a fight at that height was dangerous.

“Die, sword slave!” Jin Yi began to form seals with his hand before sending his palm out. In that split second, thousands of Thorn Flowers began to gather into a massive Thorn Flower and descended with his palm.

He had learned his lesson, so he instantly unleashed his strongest attack right from the get go. This brought immense pressure to Lin Yun.

Facing Jin Yi’s attack, Lin Yun snorted as a sword buzz rang out from within his body. He had pushed his Iris Sword Sutra to the limit and the petals in his violet palace moved like swords streaking across the horizon. At the same time, an Iris Flower bloomed behind Lin Yun with boundless sword intent.

In that split second, he managed to endure the pressure coming from Jin Yi with his sword intent and even left thousands of holes in Jin Yi’s aura. When the Iris Flower bloomed, Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent reached an unprecedented height.

Lin Yun raised his hand as sword rays began to gather in his finger. In that moment, he could feel his blood boiling as he recalled the experts in the Sword Sect. They didn’t forget their glory even after death.

Flicking Divine Finger—Graceful Moment, Absolute Hit!

Once the sword ray gathered in his nail, Lin Yun flicked his finger and a resounding sword buzz was unleashed. The attack pierced through the massive Thorn Flower and tore it apart.

Jin Yi grunted from the impact with blood leaking out of his lips. His pupil shrank while he watched the sword ray expand in his eyes. This caused his face to change drastically as he quickly avoided the attack.

But everything happened too quickly. Although he managed to avoid the sword ray, he still suffered a horrifying gnash on his chest. His Heavenly Flame Armor shattered and he yelled out in pain. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When Lin Yun’s sword ray flew, the sea of clouds was torn apart. In that split moment, everyone could see an azure-clothed youth standing above the clouds pridefully while Jin Yi was sent flying.

“Defeated in one move?” This scene had caused a huge commotion among the spectators.

“Big brother!” Jin Zhan exclaimed out as he caught Jin Yi.

“This…” Chen Ziyu was shocked and his face became grave. Unlike the others, he could see that it wasn’t just a flick. It was a terrifying secret technique that Lin Yun had cultivated to a high level.

When the Iris Flower bloomed, Chen Ziyu could sense that Lin Yun’s aura was comparable to someone in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. Otherwise, there was no way a genius like Jin Yi would lose so quickly. But the seven geniuses were ruthless people who held a deep grudge against Lin Yun. So they naturally wouldn’t stand Lin Yun’s arrogance. In that second, boundless killing aura began to spread out as the shattered clouds regathered.

“Who do you think you are? You’re just a sword slave! I’ll kill you!” Qin Xu’s eyes flashed coldly as he grew into a half-ape creature that exuded a terrifying pressure. He had truly brought out his trump card this time.

“Brother Qin, I’ll assist you!” Gu Yang also couldn’t take this lying down. As long as he could kill Lin Yun, he didn’t mind working together with others.

“Don’t think you can live after hurting my big brother!” Jin Zhan wore a sinister expression as his killing aura grew uncontrollably.

“Move quickly. We can't let him live or let the Demonification Fruit fall into his hands,” said Chen Ziyu as he looked at Chu Muyan beside him.

“We should’ve killed him earlier. He’s just a mere sword slave. Who does he think he is?” Chu Muyan’s face was dark as he soared into the sky with Chen Ziyu.

“Kill!” Even the demonic cultivators made their moves after watching the Skymound City’s geniuses make theirs.

Everyone soared into the sky as they endured the Demonification Tree’s aura. They wanted to claim Lin Yun’s life before fighting for the Demonification Fruit with nine wisps of aura. But Lin Yun didn’t move. It was almost as if he was dumbfounded by what was happening. Then again, it made sense as this was a shocking scene.

If it was someone else in Lin Yun’s position, they would be terrified to death. Just one glance from the charging crowd was frightening enough.

In the eyes of many, Lin Yun was too arrogant. He had offended everyone with his words, so he wouldn’t be able to leave even if he wanted to. That was the common thought among everyone when they saw this scene.

It appears that Lin Yun’s Demonification Fruits, Divine Indigo Radiantstone, and his life would go to someone else. In everyone’s view, Lin Yun was dead the moment he said those arrogant words earlier.

But suddenly, everyone’s jaws dropped when they saw the boundless lightning condensing above Lin Yun. It was so dense that it looked like a star was hovering over him.

Lin Yun didn’t draw his sword, but a light flashed through his pupils. As buzzing noises began to ring out, the surroundings began to tremble violently.

Overlord Sword—Big Bang!

At that moment, the faces of Chen Ziyu and the rest became pale. After all, such an attack was difficult for them to deal with normally, not to mention that they were in the air now. But that wasn’t the worst part as they were currently flying upwards. This was troublesome since Lin Yun’s attack took advantage of the pressure coming from the Demonification Tree, not to mention his attack was using gravity as well.

Qin Xu, who charged first, started to feel his skin tear apart as he threw up a mouthful of blood and dropped down. At that moment, Qin Xu had fear written on his face as he couldn’t believe he was falling down, “N-n-no…”

Not only him but those who soared into the sky were hit hard by the star and fell from the sky like bloody sandbags.

This was a shocking scene that left everyone dumbfounded. Jin Zhan, Gu Yang, Chu Muyan, and even Chen Ziyu were also halted and pulled down by the Demonification Tree’s pressure.

At this moment, everyone recalled what Lin Yun said and they felt a chill run down their spine. They now understood that this was all part of Lin Yun’s scheme.

Those who were falling down executed various means as they collided against the tree branches. However, they were left in a terrible state. No one would ever be able to get back up after falling from the Demonification Tree, not to mention from the highest place.
