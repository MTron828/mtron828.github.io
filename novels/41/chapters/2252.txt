Chapter 2253 - Let's Get Married

Lin Yun examined the island. This island wasn’t small, and a towering tree was in the middle of it. The entire island was covered with various flowers, and there were several smaller islands around this island.

When he went to the island, the pressure within the Fallen God Valley disappeared.

As zither music resounded, the towering tree rustled with the leaves emitting a faint radiance. When Lin Yun raised his head, he finally noticed that this was an ancient saint tree, giving off a majestic and ancient feeling.

Su Ziyao was stunning, as usual. When Lin Yun got close, she stopped playing the zither and said, “You’re here.”

“You don’t seem surprised?” Lin Yun smiled, putting Lil’ Purple down. When Lil’ Purple was placed on the ground, she immediately fell asleep. She might have been too exhausted.

“I knew you were here,” Su Ziyao smiled and said nothing else. She cultivated the Empress Heart Sutra, and her pain would increase the deeper she loved. So, if Lin Yun was around, she could sense the pain. But there was no need for her to tell Lin Yun that.

“She fell asleep just like that?” Lin Yun tried calling for Lil’ Purple and noticed that she wouldn’t react no matter how he tried. But her face had become rosier than before, which meant she was fine. He tried calling out to her again, but she still gave no reaction.

“You can never wake up someone who’s pretending to be asleep. This place is safe, so you can let her lie down.” Su Ziyao had no changes to her face, but she could tell that Lil’ Purple was pretending to be asleep with a glance. She held onto Lin Yun’s hand while they approached the back of the ancient tree and walked for another hundred meters, reaching a higher platform. “Let’s talk back here.”

This platform was high, and one could see a better scenery here. There was a terrifying spatial vortex here that looked ancient and mysterious.

After Lin Yun and Su Ziyao left, Lil’ Purple sat up with her fists clenched. She approached the table with the zither on it and said in disdain, “She played worse than me.”

Initially, she wanted to play a song but couldn’t feel at ease whenever she thought about Lin Yun and Su Ziyao talking out of sight.

“Damn it! They’re talking in secret without me!” Lil’ Purple turned around and threw a punch at the tree, and golden flaming patterns began to appear on the surface of it. Seeing this, her eyes lit up, and she was shocked after she took a closer look at it, exclaiming, “It’s the Divine Mulberry Tree! It’s no wonder why this place doesn’t have any pressure. It turns out that this place is special…”

She stared at the tree before entering it.

Lin Yun was filled with emotions as he looked at Su Ziyao. Who could’ve thought they were nearly separated by life and death after parting during the Blue Dragon Record? Heaven had treated him well by letting them meet again.

He held her hand tightly, not wanting to let it go for the rest of his life. He stared at her, and couldn’t help smiling. It turned out that it was so blissfully calm to be looking at someone you like.

Su Ziyao smiled, “You’re not thinking that you won’t be able to see me again, right?”

Lin Yun sat down as he pulled Su Ziyao over to his side. He smiled, “When I learned that you’re being pursued, I did think of that. But as I gathered more information later, my nerves relaxed. I knew you were alive somewhere, but I didn’t know if you’re safe. I already knew about the Fallen God Valley, but I didn’t think you would be here or I would’ve come here long ago. Look at what this is…”

As Lin Yun spoke, he took out the Divine Blood Fruit. For some reason, he had many things to discuss with Su Ziyao. He shared with her his experiences in the Heavenly Void along with the dangers on the ninth back in the Heavenly Dao Sect. Su Ziyao would listen to him as he spoke, feeling at ease.

“The Dragon Origin Great Saint won’t run out of lifespan that fast, so you don’t have to worry about him. It’s not bad to be trapped here,” Su Ziyao comforted, knowing what Lin Yun was worried about.

“Do you have a way to leave this place?” Lin Yun asked.

“I have a rough idea now, but now isn’t the time to leave. I said that I prepared a gift for you, and I can give it to you now,” Su Ziyao smiled as she stood up, pulling Lin Yun from the ground.

“Oh?” Lin Yun was curious because Su Ziyao told him she had prepared a gift for hhim, which made him curious. He watched as Su Ziyao took out a set of clothes that were paired with a jade pendant, belt, and a red string.

“This is the Azure Saint Cloth. I sewed it for you ever since our parting in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.”

“You sewed it personally?” Lin Yun was shocked. He felt conflicted as he looked at this set of clothes. He couldn’t believe that Su Ziyao sewed a saint cloth for him.

As Su Ziyao opened the clothes, she smiled, “I sewed it for many years, and I’m finally done with it. I added some materials to it, so it should feel comfortable. Try it on.”

She wore a smile with anticipation in her eyes as she helped Lin Yun change.

The Azure Saint Cloth came in a set. The interior was white, the belt was black, and a purple flower was embroidered on the waist with two pieces of cloth on both sides that could be tied into a ribbon. The outer layer was a sleeveless robe fully covered from top to bottom. The bottom had a black lotus embroidered on it. Su Ziyao must’ve spent a lot of effort on it.

But that wasn’t all. Two cloths were hanging down from the sleeves, wrapped around with a black cloth and exquisite black armguards in it.

After Lin Yun put it on, the loose saint cloth began to shrink and fitted him perfectly. The saint runes in the clothes released a faint light that connected to Lin Yun’s vitality and saint aura.

Lin Yun discovered that his body had become lighter. This saint cloth seemed to possess a massive power, and the core of that power should be from the flower at his waist. He realized that a rare Indigo Thunder Dragon Lotus was sewn into the clothes.

After Su Ziyao tidied up his collar, she was briefly dazed as she examined him.

Lin Yun was handsome, to begin with. He had a unique temperament, especially the purple mark on his forehead, which made him fit the clothes perfectly.

“As expected of the Holy Maiden Killer. You’re pretty handsome,” Su Ziyao gave a playful smile.

Lin Yun’s face sank when he heard that because that wasn’t a good title, but it appeared that he couldn’t get rid of it anymore.

“The method to sew the Azure Saint Cloth has been long lost, and I only sewed this set after coming across the method to imitate it by luck. This is a unique saint cloth, so there’s only one in the world,” Su Ziyao said. She spent five years personally sewing this, which naturally contained her feelings for Lin Yun. Others couldn’t comprehend the trouble that she had went through for this.

Lin Yun was dazed as he looked at Su Ziyao. He felt embarrassed about taking out the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown after comparing it to the Azure Saint Cloth. The Golden-Purple Dragon Crown might have a huge origin, but it couldn’t be compared to the Azure Saint Cloth that Su Ziyao personally sewed.

Seeing Lin Yun staring at her, Su Ziyao smiled, “You’re weird. You’re so eager usually, but you’re not doing anything now. Does it mean that I’m not as good-looking as before?”

Lin Yun’s face blushed when he heard that. Even someone as shameless as him couldn’t help feeling ashamed. After all, he would have normally engaged in intimate contact with Su Ziyao, so he never expected that she would use this to tease him.

“H-H-How…” Lin Yun smiled awkwardly.

Su Ziyao smiled as she took the initiative to step forth. When their faces became close, they kissed.

Not far away, a certain little girl’s fist became even more clenched with creaking sounds.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

When Lin Yun and Su Ziyao parted after a long time, their faces wore blissful smiles as each one became reflected in the other’s eyes.

“Someone is looking,” Su Ziyao smiled, hooking around Lin Yun’s neck.

Lin Yun was stumped because he had never seen Su Ziyao acting so bewitching.

“So that brat was pretending to be asleep.” Lin Yun smiled, and said, “Ziyao, I also have something for you.”

“What is it?” Su Ziyao asked, blinking her eyes.

“I couldn’t wait to give it to you in the past, but I’m a little embarrassed now after seeing the Azure Saint Cloth.” Lin Yun was straightforward and stepped back before retrieving the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. This was a crown with a Golden-Purple Dragon coiling around it, looking noble and reaching a certain point of extreme beauty.

This was a precious treasure of the Dragon Clan, a long-lost Sovereign Saint Artifact of the Divine Dragon Empire. Not only did the owner require the royal clan’s bloodline, they also needed a powerful fate to wear this crown.

When he obtained it, the first person he thought of was Su Ziyao. At long last, he finally gave it to her after so many years.

“The Golden-Purple Dragon Crown!” Su Ziyao instantly recognized the origin of this crown, with waves rising in her heart. She asked in a trembling tone, “This is for me?”

She knew better than Lin Yun how valuable this Golden-Purple Dragon Crown was and the meaning behind it.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun nodded. Seeing Su Ziyao’s expression, he heaved in relief and smiled, “A girl once said that she is proud, but she will only lower her head for a single person. Ziyao, I’m also willing to lower my head for you.”

He went down on one knee as he spoke and lifted the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. At this moment, the usually prideful youth had lowered his head.

Tears rose in Su Ziyao’s eyes before they rolled down her cheeks. She didn’t take the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown but raised Lin Yun’s head with her hands. At this moment, she couldn’t contain her grievances and emotions. She said in a trembling tone, “You’re not allowed to lower your head, not even to me.”

The two looked at each other for a long time with dense emotions in their eyes.

A long time later, Su Ziyao said, “Let’s get married.”
