Chapter 1933 - Ye Qingtian Is Here!

When the Primordial Kunpeng appeared, a massive aura swept out from Ye Qingtian and forced the dragon aura that was released from Wang Yue’s constellation back. Under the radiance of Kunpeng, the flames on the scarlet dragon became dim, leaving everyone shocked with fear within their pupils.

The scarlet dragon was over thirty feet, but it was nothing compared to Kunpeng. The Kunpeng in the air reached a hundred feet, covering the entire sky. As Kunpeng flapped its wings, a violent gale blew that caused the entire space to tremble.

“It’s really Kunpeng…”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“It’s ‘Peng’ in the water and ‘Kun’ when it’s flying.” The Saint Elders on the Heavenly Saint Altar all stood up to take a closer look.

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign was a little distracted and muttered, “How is this possible? This isn’t Ye Qingtian’s constellation before.”

“He must have reforged his constellation while refining the saint origin. Kunpeng is a primordial beast, and it could only be obtained through ancient inheritances,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said with her brows furrowed.

The other Saint Elders were also baffled but could only acknowledge what the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign was unwilling to accept this and had saint aura fill his pupils. He was a Saint Sovereign, and not many things could fool his eyes. Even if it were a powerful means, there would be flaws if used by a junior. But the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign couldn’t see anything wrong with Ye Qingtian, making him curse inwardly.

“What are you doing?” A cold voice made the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign feel a chill run down his spine. The Dragon Origin Great Saint looked at him coldly with ferocity flashing within his pupils.

When the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign looked at the Dragon Origin Great Saint, the latter felt terrified, as though he had been plunged into an abyss with a dracoape staring at him. This phenomenon was created with countless saint runes, and the eyes of the dracoape had a divine rune engraved in each one. This naturally scared the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign, with sweat covering his forehead and an invisible pressure crushing down on him. He quickly explained, “I-I have no ill intentions towards Ye Qingtian…”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint coldly said, “You’re filled with ill intentions in my eyes. How dare you peek at my disciple with the saint eyes as a Saint Sovereign yourself. He’s on the stage, but can you take responsibility if anything happens?”

The other Saint Elders quickly lowered their heads because they had also used their saint eyes earlier. It was mainly because the Kunpeng was too bizarre, and it naturally piqued their interest. After all, it was the Primordial Kunpeng, a legendary divine beast of the Northern Sea, and it had existed since the beginning of the world.

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign’s face changed, and fear began to cover his face.

Right then, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, “Tu You is at fault for this matter, but Ye Qingtian’s constellation is shocking. Even I can’t help looking at him, and I apologize for that.”

“Just this once.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint stowed his saint aura.

“For sure, for sure.” The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign heaved a breath of relief and looked at the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint with gratitude. When he turned to the Dragon Origin Great Saint, he couldn’t help being alerted. He only glanced at Ye Qingtian; if he had taken it another step further, he would be skinned even if he wasn’t killed.

He now felt fortunate that he didn’t listen to Zhang Yue and challenge the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s patience. He was much younger than the Dragon Origin Great Saint and heard many stories about that Great Saint. The Dragon Origin Great Saint once clashed with the Divine Dragon Empire, slaughtering many of the Dragon Clan’s Saints.

Furthermore, the Dragon Origin Great Saint also clashed with the Blood Moon Sect at the Yin-Yang Borders of the God Burial Woods and slaughtered many demonspirit clans. What he saw earlier should be the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s saint constellation, the Blood Purgatory.

“Ye Qingtian is going to win,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint suddenly said.

Everyone quickly raised their heads and saw Ye Qingtian standing there, allowing Wang Yue to unleash his attacks. No matter what Wang Yue did, Ye Qingtian stood unmoving and swung his sword, shattering all the incoming attacks.

Lin Yun had to admit that Wang Yue had a lot of trump cards, especially his Life Intent, which engraved many killing moves with his mark.

“Soaring Divine Dragon!” Wang Yue gritted his teeth and stomped his foot on the ground with a golden beam soaring to the sky. When he thrust his sword, it manifested into a divine dragon with a sword ray flying out.

As Wang Yue’s sword vibrated, and was accompanied by a divine dragon’s roar, his constellation let a ferocious roar that allowed Wang Yue’s aura to rise. But what happened next was a tragedy. The Kunpeng grabbed onto the Scarlet True Dragon with its claws digging into the dragon.

When Kunpeng soared to the sky, its claws ripped the Scarlet True Dragon into two, making Wang Yue throw out a mouthful of blood. Wang Yue’s aura started falling, and his sword dimmed down. He wanted to stop but could do nothing as the momentum carried him toward Lin Yun.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun clashed against Wang Yue’s sword with his two fingers. When the fingers and sword clashed, the sword was knocked away from Wang Yue’s hand and fell to the ground.

This made Wang Yue’s face change, but he still wasn’t willing to admit defeat. He raised his palms, and his Life Intent began to blaze like flames, and his injuries began to recover at a visible speed with his aura climbing back up. Even the Scarlet True Dragon, which was torn into two by Kunpeng, had started to recover. This scene made everyone’s scalps numb, and wondered if this was the true power of Life Intent.

But the corner of Lin Yun’s lip rose because he knew that Wang Yue was barely holding on.

“Flaming Cloud Palm!” Wang Yue executed a palm technique after losing his sword. Flames covered the sky, and each of his strikes left a palm in the air as Lin Yun retreated.

Wang Yue was ferocious and had gone insane by trying to shatter the space in front of him. But Lin Yun didn’t clash with him head-on and slowly retreated, avoiding all the incoming attacks.

As Lin Yun retreated, more Nether Orchids began to bloom on the stage, and it didn’t take long for half of the stage to be covered with Nether Orchids. It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to be forced to a dead end, and he would gave to leave the stage if he took another step back.

The Nether Orchids bloomed behind Wang Yue, but he suddenly stopped after seeing the smile on Ye Qingtian’s face. It appeared that he only needed a palm to push Ye Qingtian off the stage, but Wang Yue cowered because he knew that Ye Qingtian would retaliate if he carried on with his attack.

Lin Yun didn’t seem bothered by that, and he indifferently said, “I’ve said that you’re smart, but smart people often ruin themselves with their cleverness. The outcome might have been different if you had this courage three days ago. As for now, you should admit defeat!”

What he said was true because Lin Yun hadn’t grasped the Astral Sword Intent three days ago and was restricted because he couldn’t use many of his trump cards. If Wang Yue was willing to reveal his trump cards and take a risk, he might’ve won or reached a par. But Wang Yue surrendered and had instead gone to the Loser Group rather than take the risk.

Wang Yue raised his hand with trembling lips but dared not unleash his attack. Suddenly, Wang Yue heaved a sigh of relief and said, “I admit defeat.”

His face suddenly became pale, and he threw out several mouthfuls of blood. He turned around and left, waving his sword and summoning his sword back before bowing, “Thanks.”

He thanked Lin Yun for not making him lose terribly after seeing that he was barely holding on.

Lin Yun wasn’t bothered, and he turned to look at the remaining eight people and grinned, “Come at me together. It’s boring to deal with you guys one by one.”

As he spoke, Lin Yun’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent suddenly rose with the heavens shattering. Lin Yun gave off a dazzling sword ray, unleashing a massive sword intent. But what made everyone’s faces change was that Lin Yun’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent had reached complete mastery, and he was only one step away from the Astral Sword Intent.

Lin Yun was standing on the stage, but he felt like a giant and could touch the sky with a raise. Lin Yun’s hair fluttered as sword rays shone, and he laughed, “Hahaha!”

“Youths like us should be arrogant, and I wish to slay the heavens! Ye Qingtian is here, so who dares to fight me?!” Lin Yun laughed and stepped forth with his sword aura gushing out. His sword aura was like a tidal wave that made half the remaining eight fly away and throw out blood.

After they were sent flying away, they fell onto one knee with shock in their pupils, watching Ye Qingtian laugh.
