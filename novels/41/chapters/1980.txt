Chapter 1981 - Nothing Impressive

When everyone from the Heavenly Dao Sect felt at a loss, a person no one had expected appeared. Ye Qingtian stood on the roof as he wore a cynical smile.

Everyone in the plaza was stumped when they saw Ye Qingtian. Even some disciples from the Divine Dao Pavilion looked at Ye Qingtian in surprise.

“He’s Ye Qingtian? The newly risen talented swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect? But isn’t he in confinement?”

“How did he come out?” Even those from the Heavenly Dao Sect were baffled by Ye Qingtian’s appearance. There were rumors that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint heavily injured Ye Qingtian, and some said he was beaten to death. Everyone was puzzled when they saw Ye Qingtian appearing in public, uninjured.

“I knew that I didn’t make a mistake!” Wang Yue slammed on the table in excitement. Ye Qingtian was really an infatuated person, as he said, and his heart was filled with love, despite his cocky outer appearance.

Bai Shuying’s face also changed when she saw Ye Qingtian. After all, she had tried to forget about Ye Qingtian for the past few days, but she couldn’t help recalling what happened in the Celestial Pool. For some reason, she even felt a hint of fear, which she never felt before.

“It looks like I’m not too welcomed,” Ye Qingtian smiled, descending from the roof. He gazed at Bai Yizhou, Ye Qinghong, and Zhang Kui, who were also shocked by his appearance.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re confined at Remorse Cliff for intruding on forbidden ground. How dare you come out! Are you disregarding the rules and regulations of the Heavenly Dao Sect?!” Ye Qinghong roared.

Lin Yun casually found a place to sit down before he smiled, “I heard someone playing the zither, so I came out to take a breather. The holy maiden is here, so who do you think you are to stand out? Brat, are you disregarding the holy maiden’s existence?”

Ye Qinghong was immediately left speechless, with his face becoming red. This was because he never won once whenever he argued with Ye Qingtian.

“Holy Maiden, this lecher isn’t worthy of staying here. Please let me chase him out!” Ye Qinghong said, cupping his fists together.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“That’s right. How can someone as shameless as him stay here?” Bai Yizhou followed suit.

But Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of them and smiled, “I did nothing wrong, to begin with. So who said that I’m guilty? Even if I’m guilty of something, it’s not your turn to stand out. Look, the holy maiden hasn’t said anything yet.”

Bai Shuying was inwardly fuming, but she couldn’t figure out how someone could be so shameless.

“Nie Wushuang, not bad. Why don’t you carry on? I still haven’t had enough of it,” Lin Yun smiled as he looked at Nie Wushuang.

Nie Wushuang responded with a smile and placed both his hands on the zither. He didn’t reply to Ye Qingtian or play the zither. This instantly made everyone look at Ye Qingtian with surprise. After all, Nie Wushuang was a descendant of a musical clan.

The song he played earlier crushed everyone from the Heavenly Dao Sect, and they were greatly embarrassed. Even if Ye Qingtian was a talented swordsman, he had just entered the Nirvana Stage. So no one was optimistic that he could face Nie Wushuang, who was at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

Only Ye Qinghong, Zhang Kui, and Bai Yizhou were stronger than him amongst the Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples because they were outstanding geniuses of their clans. But they had no intention of stepping out. Not only that, they even mocked their fellow saint disciples and praised Nie Wushuang instead. Naturally, this made everyone furious, but they could do nothing about it.

A smile appeared on Nie Wushuang’s face as he said, “I have long heard of your name before coming to the Heavenly Dao Sect. But honestly speaking, I don’t think you’re qualified to listen to my music.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun’s interest was piqued, and he smiled, “I’ll be honest with you. I have some knowledge of music dao as well. So why don’t you listen to mine?”

The moment he said that, Ye Qinghong burst into laughter, “Ye Qingtian, don’t embarrass yourself. You’re nothing compared to Young Master Wushuang. He’s a descendant of a musical clan. It’s fine to embarrass yourself, but don’t embarrass our Heavenly Dao Sect.”

“You’re just a clown. It looks like being confined at Remorse Cliff wasn’t enough to change your cockiness,” Bai Yizhou mocked.

“You’re not even worthy of cleaning the shoes for our young master, and yet you want to play music before our young master?” A servant beside Nie Wushuang said.

“It looks like I’ve kept too low of a profile,” Lin Yun smiled. He noticed that many of the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples brought musical instruments with them, and he smiled, “Is there any big sister who is willing to lend me a musical instrument?”

“Ye Qingtian, use mine!”

“Ye Qingtian, use mine!”

Many of the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples had a good impression of Ye Qingtian and didn’t hesitate to send their musical instruments over.

This scene naturally made many of the Heavenly Dao Sect’s saint disciples jealous, looking at the passionate Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples. Lin Yun picked a zither and briefly examined it before placing it on the table before him.

Nie Wushuang glanced at the servant standing beside him, and the servant roared, “What audacity! Who allowed you to play the zither before my young master?!”

The servant quickly dashed out. He actually had a cultivation at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, surprising many people. He might be fast, but Lin Yun was even faster and had played the zither.

When the musical note burst, the servant was sent flying away, heavily injured by the note. The servant threw a mouthful of blood as he fell to the ground.

This scene happened too quickly, and no one came to their senses. They could only look at Ye Qingtian with shock.

“As the saying goes, you must look at the owner if you want to beat the dog. But I can’t stand dogs barking when I’m playing the zither, so I apologize, Young Master Wushuang,” Lin Yun smiled. He might be apologizing, but he didn’t look like it.

“It’s fine,” Nie Wushuang maintained his smile, but murderous intent began to brew within his pupils.

“Hahaha! Let’s begin!” When Lin Yun’s hands fell on the zither, the aura he gave off changed. At this moment, he looked serene, like a musician with the zither in his eyes. When many of the women looked at Ye Qingtian’s face, and they couldn’t describe the charm he was giving off. Ye Qingtian's temperament was charming, and even Nie Wushuang was inferior to him.

But zither music suddenly rang out, and it came from Nie Wushuang. He only strummed a zither string, and the explosive note instantly attracted everyone’s attention. When he played the zither, he drew many people into his music.

Lin Yun merely smiled before he played the zither, and the musical note he released was like a sword. When he closed his eyes, he felt he had returned to the day he just arrived in the Kunlun Realm. His experience in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was filled with anticipation for the future, and he didn’t have to worry about his master’s lifespan ending.

He recalled how he played the flute to kill during the full moon, fully displaying the elegance of Flower Burial. When Lin Yun reopened his eyes, his pupils shone brightly.

“Saint Tune!” Everyone was shocked; their faces changed. This was because no one expected Ye Qingtian to grasp the Saint Tune. His music didn’t seem inferior to Nie Wushuang, and his skills were stronger than Zhou Xu's.

As Lin Yun and Nie Wushuang’s music clashed, the sky suddenly became dark, and Lin Yun’s music actually suppressed Nie Wushuang’s music. This made Nie Wushuang frown with a cold light flashing across his pupils because he didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to know music.

“Pitiful attempt!” Nie Wushuang snorted, releasing his Great Saint Tune. A chill began to gather in his fingers, indicating that he was becoming serious. Thunderclouds began to rumble above Lin Yun, with lightning being condensed from the Great Saint Tune. This instantly made everyone’s hearts tremble because this attack defeated Zhou Xu. Everyone began to wonder if Ye Qingtian could really take this attack head-on.

But Lin Yun wasn’t afraid and increased his speed while playing the zither, and his musical notes were accumulating like a sword, wanting to sever everything. Lin Yun flicked his finger on the zither just when the crimson lightning bolt was about to descend. He smiled, “Great Saint Tune? I happen to have grasped it as well.”

Crimson fireworks began to bloom and spread out along with his music, making everyone’s faces change. “Great Saint Tune!”

Not only did Ye Qingtian grasp the Saint Tune, he even reached the level of the Great Saint Tune. Could it be that Ye Qingtian was also a genius in music dao? Even Bai Shuying was surprised, and her pupils were filled with doubt when she looked at Ye Qingtian. She muttered, “What’s going on?”

This was different from the Ye Qingtian she knew. But Lin Yun didn’t seem to have turned the table around because of his Great Saint Tune because the crimson lightning began to accumulate above his head, gradually forming into a terrifying vortex.

But Lin Yun didn’t seem to have seen it and was undisturbed by Nie Wushuang, focused on playing his music.

The surrounding wind seemed alive as it danced under Lin Yun’s music. But this surprised Nie Wushuang because he couldn’t find any flaw in Ye Qingtian’s music, nor figure out how Ye Qingtian managed to do it. Based on Ye Qingtian’s performance, his attainment in music could be considered at the top of the pyramid, even within the Ten Musical Clans.

Lin Yun entered a high mental state and laughed as he played the zither. His music gradually became louder, and everyone was shocked to discover that Nie Wushuang couldn’t suppress Ye Qingtian. The crimson vortex was slowly being dissolved, and the lightning was weakened.

“Rising wind and intoxicating clouds!” Lin Yun laughed, and his music suddenly became rampant. His accumulated aura was like a sword that soared to the sky, slicing apart the thunderclouds and allowing sunlight to shine down on him. At this moment, Lin Yun’s hair and clothes fluttered in the wind as he wore a smile.

“Nie Wushuang, you don’t seem that impressive after all,” Lin Yun smiled. “I suppose it’s my turn now?”

Lin Yun’s music tore the thunderclouds apart, and his music was like an army charging at Nie Wushuang.
