Chapter 1853 - Fire God General's Death

Just when the two palms were about to come in contact, the Fire God Generals squinted his eyes with a murderous aura filling his pupils. He was at the third stage Profound Death Stage, and if they clashed head-on, he was confident that he could sever Lin Yun’s arm, even if he didn’t kill the latter.

When the two palms came in contact, one was enveloped with a crimson radiance while the other was enveloped with a purple radiance and sword aura that soared to the sky. When the terrifying sword aura swept out, it shocked everyone as they retreated, dragging their injured bodies. But some people couldn’t avoid it in time and were caught in the shockwave, throwing out mouthfuls of blood while being sent flying away. They were all surprised without exception.

“That Lin Xiao is too bold!”

“Someone at the Dragon Pulse Realm dares to clash with the Profound Death Stage head-on?” Yi Feng, Yan Chihuo, and the other holy land geniuses were surprised when they saw this scene.

As the dazzling radiance from the Fire God General and Lin Yun dissipated, the two still maintained direct contact with their palms.

“This…” Everyone was dumbfounded, and they couldn’t comprehend what they had witnessed.

“You brat, what the hell did you obtain?!” The Fire God General was shocked. He couldn’t understand what Lin Yun got in the Black Tortoise Vault for him to become so strong, and there was a chance it might be even more significant than the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown!

“Why don’t you take a guess?” Lin Yun replied.

“Don’t worry about it. After I dig out your eyes, my Blood Moon Sect will have plenty of ways to make you speak.” The Fire God General suppressed his fury, and began to circulate his dragon origin. Not long later, he unleashed his cultivation at the third stage Profound Death Stage.

This immediately increased the pressure on Lin Yun, and fine cracks also appeared on his sword aura. But before his sword aura was about to collapse, a sword vibration echoed from within his body that resisted the pressure from the Fire God General. It didn’t take long for his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent to break through the shackles of greater mastery.

This naturally shocked everyone because Lin Yun took another step in the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

“Let me see how long you can hold on for!” The Fire God General roared, and pushed his palm forth, forcing Lin Yun to retreat to the sea’s surface.

“Go back!” Lin Yun roared as ten dragon pulses reaching thirty thousand feet appeared, covering the sky and leaving everyone shocked.

“Is this his opportunity?” Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng were both dumbfounded, and they finally knew why Lin Yun stayed in the Black Tortoise Void Sea for so long. After all, the tenth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm was the limit.

This caught the Fire God General by surprise. He wiped the blood off his lips and was pushed back by Lin Yun. Lin Yun was probably comparable to a first stage Profound Death Stage in terms of cultivation. In addition to his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, he was capable of facing someone at the third stage Profound Death Stage, not to mention a monstrous genius like the Fire God General.

If it were an ordinary genius at the third stage Profound Death Stage, Lin Yun would have an easier time dealing with them. But if he had to face monstrous geniuses like the Fire God General, even if they didn’t have a cultivation at the third stage Profound Death Stage, it would be troublesome for him to deal with them. With that, Lin Yun had a clear gauge of his strength.

On the sea’s surface, Lin Yun forced the Fire God General back with a palm and took a long breath. The Demigod Wine accumulated within his body was gradually being released under this clash, and he could sense that his cultivation was rising a little.

“Nethersky Seal!” The Fire God General soared to the sky with crimson flames blazing within his pupils, and the saint runes began to bloom on the Nethermoon Saint Armor he was wearing. As an ancient aura swept out, it felt like a ferocious beast was awakened by him, and the aura he gave off began to rise.

“Remnant Dragon Finger!” The Fire God General unleashed a crimson beam of light with his left hand on his right wrist. When the beam flew out, the sea was split apart like beancurd, which was the secret technique of the Blood Moon Sect.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Lin Yun turned around in mid-air and avoided this beam. But that beam soared to the sky, creating a hole in the dragon pulses. Before he could even respond, the Fire God General unleashed more beams, completely suppressing Lin Yun’s aura and placing him in a dilemma.

The remnant crimson radiance still lingered within the air for a long time, spreading to a few dozen miles away and even causing the surrounding space to distort.

The black-clothed Quasi-Saint suddenly opened his eyes with surprise because the Nethersky Seal and Remnant Dragon Finger were vicious secret techniques of the Blood Moon Sect. Upon being executed, an outcome would often be swiftly determined. But Lin Yun was calmly facing the Fire God General’s attacks.

“Take a finger from me too!” When the Fire God General’s movements slowed down, Lin Yun raised his brow and the Iris Saint Seal bloomed on the back of his finger with his thumb pressing down on his middle finger.

Lin Yun’s dragon origin began to gather, and the Azure Dragon Sword Soul flew out from his brows. His right hand became heated. Everything from his fingers to his wrist became white like jade. Accompanied by a sword vibrating from within his body, multiple swords rose from the sea. The swords were emitting a faint blue radiance, and each sword contained a powerful sword intent.

With a gentle raise of his right hand, those swords were like grass being blown by a powerful wind rushing towards Lin Yun. There were thousands of swords revolving around him that looked like a dragon.

“Flicking Divine Finger!” A terrifying sword aura exploded from Lin Yun. Flicking his finger, the swords began to combine into a real dragon. That wasn’t an Azure Dragon, but it contained the Azure Dragon’s profundity, with the swords forming its skeletal structure.

This caught the Fire God General by surprise and sent him flying away. From the sheer impact, a huge hole appeared on the sea’s surface and looked like an abyss. As for the Fire God General, there was a bloody hole in his chest as he threw out blood.

“The Glory Saint Artifact failed to protect him?!”

“What secret technique is that?” Everyone was shocked. The Nethermoon Saint Armor might be swiftly repairing itself, but the Glory Saint Artifact was damaged by Lin Yun’s attack. Before everyone could come to their senses, a sword vibration echoed, and the Flower Burial Sword flew to the sky from Lin Yun’s left hand, instantly reaching the Fire God General.

The Fire God General managed to block this attack by crossing his arms together. But before he could catch his breath, the Flower Burial Sword returned to Lin Yun’s hand and he swung it down.

Azure Dragon Claw!

Pouring the Azure Dragon Sword Intent into his sword, a golden dragon claw was unleashed by a sword ray. This made the Fire God General’s lips twitch, and he spread his hands out with a constellation appearing behind him. He didn’t dare to hold back in such a critical moment and summoned his constellation. The painting was a blood moon, and moonlight shone from the painting when his constellation appeared.

As the Fire God General threw out a punch, the crimson moonlight manifested into a fist that shattered the incoming dragon claw.

“To be able to force me to this point, you can be considered…” Just when the Fire God General wanted to say something after resolving Lin Yun’s attack, Lin Yun swung his sword again, executing the Azure Dragon Sword Art—Azure Dragon Tail.

But unlike before, three paintings flew out behind Lin Yun as the hundred-foot sword ray swept out in the form of a dragon’s tail. The crimson moonlight was completely covered up as the three paintings shone brightly.

The first painting portrayed a Winged Dragon, the second was the Kunpeng, and the third was the Demonic Phoenix.

Before the Fire God General could even finish his sentence, the dragon’s tail lashed his face. The tail easily tore apart the Fire God General’s dragon origin, leaving a bloody gash on his face.

“Azure Dragon Claw!” Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t allow the Fire God General to catch his breath and swung his sword down. As the dazzling sword ray manifested into a golden dragon claw and descended, the Fire God General’s arms were numb when he tried to block Lin Yun’s attack by crossing his arms together.

“Azure Dragon Claw!” Lin Yun soared to the sky and unleashed another Azure Dragon Claw. This time, he empowered his attack with the three constellations and unleashed nine dragon claws. Whenever the dragon claws soared to the sky, they suppressed the Fire God General in a domineering manner, making him throw out a mouthful of blood after nine claws.

As the Fire God General staggered to maintain his footing, he roared, “You bastard, is this all you know?!”

“As you wish!” Lin Yun turned around and thrust his sword towards the Fire God General’s chest. But the sword failed to pierce it because of a huge obstruction.

This scene made the Fire God General snicker, “You think I’ll fall for the same trick twice? Do you think you can stab through the Nethermoon Saint Armor?”

“Don’t be so sure about that…” Lin Yun gently pushed his sword in after activating the glory spirits through his greater mastery of Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

This scene made the black-clothed Quasi-Saint furious as he roared, “Brat, you’re courting death!”

He immediately soared to the sky, wanting to kill Lin Yun with a flick of his finger and rescue the Fire God General. As a Quasi-Saint, he naturally had that strength, which was why he watched from the side. But just when he soared to the sky, a figure dashed forth, and they exchanged a palm.

As two saint auras exploded, the black-clothed Quasi-Saint and that person took several steps back. When everyone raised their heads to take a closer look, they saw that it was the old beggar was following Lin Yun.

Squinting his eyes with a smile, Gu Jun stroked his beard, “Who’s not a Quasi-Saint nowadays?”

This naturally caught the black-clothed Quasi-Saint by surprise as he took several steps back.

“Quasi-Saint!” When the six holy land parties saw this scene, they naturally rejoiced with their eyes lighting up.

“Bannerlord, save me!” The Fire God General screamed, looking at Lin Yun with horror.

But Lin Yun didn’t bother with his scream and slammed his palm on the Flower Burial Sword’s hilt, sending the sword into the Fire God General’s chest. But the sword didn’t stop there and turned around, stabbing through the Fire God General’s head.

When Lin Yun held onto his sword, he gently shook it to shake off the blood. Everything happened in a split second and was so fast that no one could respond in time. After everyone noticed it had come to an end, the six holy land parties were completely stumped.
