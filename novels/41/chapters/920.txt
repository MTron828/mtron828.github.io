Chapter 921 - Don’t Disappoint Me and I Won’t Disappoint!

Outside the barrier, Lil’ Red finished teaching the higher realm geniuses a lesson. It took a long time before everyone calmed down and turned back to watch the barrier.

There were still three people inside the barrier. With Mo Han and Shi Feng around, the cultivators from the higher realms felt anxious. They couldn’t wait to see Lin Yun suffer a setback for standing against the higher realms.

However, they weren’t so sure what would happen since Lin Yun killed Chen An too. Suddenly, the spectators saw the barrier cracking.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Not good!”

“The barrier is exploding!”

“Did someone get the Glorysun Spirit?” Everyone’s face changed when they noticed the cracks on the barrier.

Not long after, the barrier exploded and torrential flames soared into the sky and dyed it red. Within the torrential flames were Lin Yun, Mo Han, and Shi Feng.

When Lin Yun took the Glorysun Spirit, the barrier couldn’t maintain itself anymore. Naturally, Lin Yun, Shi Feng, and Mo Han were kicked out of the hall.

Contrary to Lin Yun, Shi Feng and Mo Han were upset. It was clear for everyone to see that Lin Yun had something that Shi Feng and Mo Han wanted.

Thinking about that, the spectators from the higher realms felt uneasy.

“Lin Yun, you’ve already killed Feng Wuji and will need to face the warth of the Bloodbone Realm. Don’t push your luck. If you’re willing to hand the Glorysun Spirit over, our realms can guarantee your safety!” Mo Han said coldly. When the crowd heard this, they felt disbelief. Lin Yun really took the Glorysun Spirit!

“Guarantee my safety?” Lin Yun mocked Mo Han and said, “You guys should worry about your own safety instead. I told you, you’re dead!”

“How arrogant. Do you really think you can survive against us?” Shi Feng snorted and attacked first. With a flash, he gathered his origin energy into his dao artifact and unleashed a purple sword ray of over 300 meters.

“You better not regret your decision!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly because he wasn’t going to hold back. It didn’t matter if Mo Han and Shi Feng had a higher cultivation or dao artifacts. Time and time again, they threatened him and even formed an alliance to gang up on him, so Lin Yun would make them pay.

With a single thought, his immortal azure dragon sword intent gushed out and formed an azure dragon.

“Break!” Circulating both sword sutras at the same time, boundless origin energy empowered by his sword intent gushed out and crushed Shi Feng’s attack.

It wasn’t easy on Lin Yun because he wasn’t able to use his sword. However, he could feel that the Flower Burial Sword was enraged. Since it was linked to him, it wouldn’t tolerate Lin Yun being bullied by Shi Feng and a dao artifact.

Lin Yun forcibly suppressed the Flower Burial Sword because it was at a critical point of upgrading. If he relied on it right now, he would disrupt the upgrade. If that happened, who knew how long it would be until it would upgrade.

“Without a dao artifact, you’re nothing!” Shi Feng’s aura grew even more sinister as he continued his assault.

“Is that so?” Lin Yun sneered with disdain on his face and retaliated with an attack.

Shi Feng raised his hand to face Lin Yun’s attack because he wanted to compare himself to Lin Yun. However, his face changed and he was forced backwards because he chose not to use his dao artifact. At this moment, everyone could tell that Shi Feng was trash without his dao artifact.

“Mo Han, what are you waiting for?” yelled Shi Feng coldly.

“Hehe. I’m coming!” Mo Han smiled before he let out a roar. His halberd transformed into a ferocious beast that pounced at Lin Yun.

Shi Feng unleashed another attack to join Mo Han’s. Both dao artifacts joined together and released an aura that made the sky tremble.

Who would have thought that Lin Yun would force two geniuses from the higher realms this far? Not only were they forced to join hands, but they even used their dao artifacts.

If anyone else were in Lin Yun’s position, they would be feeling despair. However, Lin Yun spread his arms apart without any fear. He could still feel the Flower Burial Sword trembling in the sword box, so he comforted it. “Calm down. I’m having fun.”

Lin Yun pushed his spiritual sword intent to the limit and circulated his sword sutras. As he moved, sword rays started to hit Mo Han and Shi Feng. He created a violent storm full of blood and sword rays.

“How terrifying. Dao artifacts are really terrifying.”

“Lin Yun’s sword intent is completely suppressed when facing two dao artifacts. The battle is almost over.”

“Lin Yun’s sword isn’t a dao artifact. He can’t use it or else it will snap in half.”

“Lin Yun is in a dangerous situation now.” The spectators were full of emotion as they watched the earth-shattering battle. They knew it was only a matter of time until Lin Yun died.

Suddenly, Lin Yun felt the Flower Burial Sword stop its trembling. Its upgrade was a success.

“Brat, don’t blame us for bullying you. You can only blame yourself for not having a daot artifact!” Shi Feng laughed while pushing his sword to the limit and roared, “It’s over!”

At this moment, Lin Yun had nowhere to retreat, so Shi Feng yelled, “Die!”

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as his sword box opened up. Countless petals enveloped Lin Yun as he grabbed hold of the Flower Burial Sword.

Lin Yun could sense the boundless rage of the Flower Burial Sword. It was angry at Shi Feng and Mo Han.

As Lin Yun’s sword, it couldn’t stand to see Lin Yun being bullied by other weapons. It hated itself for not being a dao artifact, so it tried to upgrade as fast as it could.

“I’m sorry,” said Lin Yun as his nose felt a bit sour. He was trying to be considerate of the Flower Burial Sword and its upgrade, but he had completely neglected its feelings.

The Flower Burial Sword hummed in response as if it were telling Lin Yun not to worry. After all, it was the reason why Lin Yun was getting bullied in the first place.

Lin Yun’s eyes suddenly glowed brightly as he roared, “Mere fireflies dares to compete with my Flower Burial Sword?”

After all this time, the Flower Burial Sword stood by his side without fail. As long as the Flower Burial Sword didn’t disappoint him, he wouldn’t disappoint it.
