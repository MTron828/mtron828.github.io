Chapter 1413 - Promise Me!

The surrounding temperature dropped when that cold voice resounded. This voice sounded young, but it was so terrifyingly cold that it could make one’s soul tremble.

“W-Why is it so cold…?” Xiahou Yun shivered with his lips turning pale. He had never sensed such a powerful killing intent before in his life. He lived his entire life in the Xiahou Saint Clan, and his elder brother was Xiahou Yan. So no one dared to provoke him. But this eerie voice made him feel as if the owner of this voice was a demon who climbed out of hell.

“That person is here.” Bai Zhanli became nervous and didn’t dare to let his guard down. He wasn’t the same as Xiahou Yun. He could sense that Lin Yun was a formidable opponent right from the start.

The sudden appearance of the killing intent made all the surrounding demonic beasts kneel. Even the gazes of the four brothers from the Huang Clan became dark as they looked around.

“Junior Brother Lin!” Lin Yun suddenly appeared before everyone with an azure flash. When Feng Zhang and the rest saw Lin Yun, they didn’t have much joy on their faces. Instead, they had shame on their faces, especially Ye Ziling, who bit her lips. “Junior Brother Lin!”

Lin Yun’s face sank when he saw everyone’s injuries. His eyes began to flash with a cold light, but he ultimately suppressed it and asked, “Who did this to you guys?”

When Zhao Yan silently looked at Xiahou Yan, Lin Yun instantly figured it out. Right then, Ye Ziling let out a soft grown from her mouth. Ten-odd overlord demonic beasts had besieged her and she barely managed to survive because she was still at the Lesser Elysium Core Realm, but she was covered in blood and had three claw wounds on both of her thighs.

Lin Yun quickened his pace and took out a bottle of spiritual medicine. He applyied it to her wounds before Ye Ziling could say a word. This was a standard medicine that all cultivators would carry with them. It was a pity that he ran out of Nirvana Pellets and could only use these ordinary medicines.

“Lin Yun, you shouldn’t have come.” Ye Ziling said with a bitter smile.

“What are you talking about? We’re all Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect disciples.” Lin Yun continued to apply medicine to her, and he smiled, “Don’t overthink it. Let me dress your wounds.”

When Ye Ziling heard that, she finally couldn’t hold it anymore and tears began to well in her eyes. She was openly crying. She had always been a strong woman and never cried since she was sensible. No matter what she experienced in the past, she would never shed a tear, even when she faced life and death. But she finally couldn’t hold it back anymore this time.

“Junior Brother Lin, they wanted to use us to threaten you. I’m really useless. I’m sorry.” Ye Ziling’s emotions had collapsed. She wasn’t afraid of death or failure, but she felt terrible for becoming a burden to Lin Yun.

Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan felt terrible, but they couldn’t say anything.

Ye Ziling’s current state made Lin Yun feel heartache, but he still revealed a gentle smile. “Ye Ziling, remember our bet back in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? You owe me a promise, no matter what it was. Do you remember?”

Ye Ziling was stumped when she heard that because she didn’t know why Lin Yun mentioned this now. She naturally remembered the bet she made with Lin Yun back then. It was about whether Lin Yun could get through the thirteen stages on the Sword Saint Mountain and she lost.

“I want to use that bet now. Promise me that you’ll only cry this once. You’re not allowed to cry in the future. You’re Ye Ziling, our senior sister.” Lin Yun said seriously.

When Ye Ziling heard what Lin Yun said, she was dumbfounded because his words were like a warm current that flowed into her heart. As she raised her head and looked at Lin Yun, she could tell Lin Yun was serious about this. She never imagined that Lin Yun would ask something like this from her.

“I promise you.” Ye Ziling gritted her teeth.

“Looks like Flower Burial is someone who cherishes relationships, just as rumored…” Xiahou Yan wore a mocking smile with disdain flashing through his pupils. He only found Lin Yun was foolish to come and die just for a bunch of strangers who had no family ties to him.

In his view, relationships were unnecessary to a swordsman because they would make him vulnerable, just like Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun stood up, he looked at Xiahou Yan with a cold light flashing through his pupils. He smiled, “Looks like I really have a good temper. I should’ve crippled you outside the secret realm.”

“Still so arrogant when you’re pushed to a dead-end. Hand over the Bodhi Seed, and I can treat it as if nothing has happened today.” Xiahou Yan coldly said. “Otherwise, my Xiahou Saint Clan won’t let you off, even if you guys are eliminated today.”

“Brother Xiahou, is this the rumored Flower Burial?” Huang Yancheng smiled. “Why do you have to dirty your hands over someone like him? If you don’t mind, let us teach Flower Burial a lesson on your behalf.”

Xiahou Yan’s face changed because he knew that Huang Yancheng wanted to take this opportunity to display his strength. The stronger he was, the more rights to speak he would have when competing for the treasure in the sword mound.

“I naturally don’t mind since Brother Huang is willing to make a move,” Xiahou Yan smiled. They made it sound like Lin Yun was someone they could easily crush.

“You guys must be behind the demonic beasts…” Lin Yun said, looking at Huang Yancheng. He could feel something unusual when he faced the Azureflame Dracoserpent, and it was dangerous to stay in the woods. But he never expected that they were prevented from leaving the woods.

Huang Yancheng was a little stumped by Lin Yun’s words. As the corner of his lips twitched, he smiled, “You should be worried about yourself, instead. Third brother, go and teach him a lesson. Teach this Flower Burial how to behave, or he might think he’s invincible in the Kunlun Realm!”

Lin Yun squinted his eyes, appearing to be smiling. But he walked towards the four brothers of the Huang Clan. Seeing Lin Yun’s action, everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and the two Saint Clans was utterly dumbfounded. The four brothers of the Huang Clan weren’t weak. On the contrary, they were terrifying geniuses of the Ancient Barren Domain.

“You’re courting death!” Huang Kui, the third brother of the Huang Clan, sneered before he unleashed his aura in the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. When he took a step out, he instantly appeared before Lin Yun.

Using his fingers as a sword, the elysium core in his violet palace circulated with boundless astral energy forming into a ten-foot long sword that tore space apart. But facing this sword aura, Lin Yun merely raised his right hand to grab a hold of the sword aura.

“Such impudence.” Huang Kui smiled, along with the other brothers of the Huang Clan. The cultivation technique that Huang Kui practiced was terrifying, and he had long condensed five innate saint auras. So his sword aura was something that not even Heavenly Elysium Core Realm geniuses dared to belittle.

So Lin Yun’s act of using his hand to take on his sword aura was nothing more than courting death in his eyes. But the smile only lasted for a brief moment on his face before Huang Kui’s smile froze. As three thousand dragon runes gathered in his palm, Lin Yun grabbed the sword aura before crushing it by clenching his fist. When a dragon roar echoed, golden light surged, and countless fragments of Huang Kui’s sword aura were blown away.

“How is this possible?!” Huang Kui was utterly dumbfounded. But before he could react, Lin Yun appeared before him. Lin Yun’s speed made Huang Kui widen his eyes and summon his saint sword from the sword box. Without hesitation, he swung his sword at Lin Yun, containing a boundless killing aura.

But Lin Yun didn’t want to waste time with Huang Kui, so he threw his punch with sword rays from his body. Lin Yun also circulated nine strands of Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura in his body to easily shatter Huang Kui’s sword intent.

He had used the Divine Solar Lunar Fist—Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron!

When his punch landed on Huang Kui, his punch manifested into a giant cauldron. The huge impact made Huang Kui throw out a mouthful of blood before a terrifying shockwave spread out. Facing the shockwave, regardless of the Huang Clan’s three brothers or the two Saint Clans' geniuses, they quickly retreated with their movement techniques.

Lin Yun had heavily injured Huang Kui with just one punch, injuring a genius from the Ancient Barren Domain. Huang Yancheng and Xiahou Yan were surprised because they never expected Lin Yun to be so strong.

Right then, flute music resounded, controlling the surrounding demonic beasts to pounce at Lin Yun. Ten-odd overlord demonic beasts sprang at Lin Yun without regard for their lives in that split second.

As for Huang Kui, he rolled and left the region. The black-clothed youth had a cold light flashing through his pupils while he manipulated the demonic beasts.

But Lin Yun clasped his hands together and a golden light exploded from him. In the next second, a shadow flew from his body, and the ten-odd demonic beasts were all sent flying away. It was a dragon that flew out from Lin Yun, which looked like it was alive.

When the azure dragon appeared, the surrounding demonic beasts immediately submitted, making the black-clothed youth inwardly curse. He didn’t hesitate to circulate his saint rune with his soul energy exhausted, rapidly trying to manipulate those demonic beasts.

Right then, Huang Yancheng’s face changed, and he yelled, “Fourth Brother, watch out!”

But it was already too late. Lin Yun executed the Azure Dragon Grasp before the black-clothed youth could respond. As a powerful suction force exploded from the dragon claw, the black-clothed youth was pulled over to Lin Yun.

The remaining brothers of the Huang Clan tried to rescue their fourth brother, but the azure dragon around Lin Yun released a roar and flew out. When the three were forced back by the azure dragon, Lin Yun grabbed onto the black-clothed youth’s throat and raised him in the air.

“You’re the one behind the demonic beasts, right?” Lin Yun asked indifferently.

“Get lost!” The black-clothed youth cursed even though he was under Lin Yun’s mercy.

“Fuck!” Huang Yancheng cursed before he charged over. He was strong, and everyone was shocked when he unleashed his two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm cultivation aura.

Xiahou Yan also didn’t hesitate to charge forth and unleashed his aura as well, suppressing Lin Yun together with Huang Yancheng.

But Lin Yun flicked his wrist and grabbed onto the black-clothed youth’s leg before using him as a weapon to slam against Xiahou Yan.

Just when Xiahou Yan was about to make a move, Huang Yancheng’s voice resounded, “I won’t let you off if you dare to hurt my younger brother!”

His words made Xiahou Yan unhappily frown his brows before he chose to avoid Lin Yun’s attack. But Lin Yun simply turned around and swung the black-clothed youth at Huang Yancheng. This caught Huang Yancheng by surprise, not to mention that Huang Yancheng couldn’t use his full strength, or he would injure his younger brother. So he was greatly restricted in this fight, with his face becoming ugly.

“You’re courting death!” Huang Yancheng roared as he lost control of his emotions.

But Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with him. His gaze fell onto the two Saint Clans' party. This instantly made Bai Zhanli and Xiahou Yun feel a chill down their spines.

Before they could react, Lin Yun already charged over with the black-clothed youth in his hand, “You guys want to teach me a lesson? Let me see who’ll be taught a lesson, then!”
