Chapter 893 - Amenable to Coaxing but not Coercion

One took three steps back while the other took four. Chen Xuan had won by a small margin. Aside from the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts, it was hard for anyone to see the exchange clearly.

Lin Yun had seen everything clearly as Chen Xuan and Pei Yu utilized their aura ocean at the same time. When he saw the boundless energy in their bodies, even he couldn’t help feeling a little fearful. There was no question that the aura coming from Chen Xuan and Pei Yue was a lot stronger than Yan Kui and Qin Feng.

If he was facing Yan Kui or Qin Feng, he wouldn’t even have to use his sword intent. He could rely on his two sword sutras to face them head-on. He might even be able to suppress them a little. But it would be lacking if he faced Pei Yu and Chen Xuan. He would have to use his sword intent or else he wouldn’t be able to obtain any advantages.

Thinking about it, Lin Yun’s eyes turned dim and he felt somewhat disappointed. But soon after, he started laughing inwardly. What exactly was he sad about? He was only in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm, so naturally facing two pinnacles first soul Heavenly Soul Realm was a pipe dream. Although it was unprecedented for someone to practice two sword sutras at the same time, it was unreasonable for him to want to suppress someone an entire realm above him.

There was naturally nothing to say about Pei Yu and Chen Xuan. They were stronger than Yan Kui and Qin Feng because they were in the pinnacle first soul Heavenly Soul Realm. More importantly, Chen Xuan and Pei Yu used more astral pellets when undergoing their tribulation. The difference in strength was based on one’s foundation.

Lin Yun’s advantage was the sword in his hand and his unprecedented attainment in the sword path. There was no need for him to compete with them in his origin energy. After all, he would just cut down everything in his path with his sword.

Lin Yun’s mind gradually cleared up. Aside from obtaining the Golden Flowlight Lamp, he also had to temper his Three Heavenly Divides. The Lightning Cocoon and Azure Lotus were fine, but he needed to be more proficient in them. As for Solaris Lunar, he still had a long way to go to perfect it.

“Thank you,” smiled Chen Xuan while cupping his hands together.

“It looks like the rumors are true. The Highcloud Realm’s foundation is approaching the higher realms.” Pei Yu was naturally unhappy to lose the bet, but he quickly found an excuse for himself. Then, he waved his hand and tossed the Demonic Soul Fruit over to Chen Xuan.

“But a single exchange doesn’t mean anything. We’ll meet again in Flamefeather City!” Pei Yu was rather straightforward with his reminder to Chen Xuan. Then, he left with the Blackshark Realm’s party.

“Senior brother is really strong. The Blackshark Realm is courting death if they want to compete with us.”

“That’s right! Pei Yu didn't even dare to utter a word when he handed the Demonic Soul Fruit over.”

Everyone from the Highcloud Realm came over and congratulated Chen Xuan. All of them were excited, especially Liu Yun who had finally gotten back the Demonic Soul Fruit. It might not be a rare treasure, but it was a huge fortune for Liu Yun since it was valued around 200,000 astral pellets.

Chen Xuan was rather calm and said, “It was just a single move. Pei Yu was right. If we went all out, I don’t know who would win. My odds of beating him aren't high, and it’s practically impossible for me to kill him.”

“Senior brother, the Demonic Soul Fruit…” Liu Yun looked at Chen Xuan and smiled.

Chen Xuan fell into deep thoughts before he said, “You already have the tribulation qualification. The danger of using the Demonic Soul Fruit isn’t small, and it might leave behind hidden injuries. At that time, it’ll be a huge issue for you when facing the tribulation.”

Liu Yun naturally knew that. Even if he didn’t use it, he could always sell it. Chen Xuan paused briefly before he smiled, “You already have a decent harvest hunting demonic beasts. How about this, let’s give this fruit to Lin Yun. He needs it since he’s the only quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm among us. If we find anything precious in the Flamefeather City, I’ll give it to you.”

Liu Yun was shocked because he never expected that his senior brother would want to give it to Lin Yun. In his eyes, Lin Yun was lucky to grasp the spiritual sword intent. On top of that, he hadn’t even reached the Heavenly Soul Realm. There was no way Lin Yun could compare to him in terms of potential. But since Chen Xuan had spoken, there was nothing Liu Yun could do but to accept it.

“Brother Lin, you can have this fruit.” Seeing Chen Xuan handing the fruit over, Lin Yun hesitated briefly before accepting it. He had only heard of this fruit. If he could temper his origin energy produced by his two sword sutras, the benefits he could obtain would be twice the amount that other people could obtain.

“Brother Lin, what do you think of my Highcloud Realm? I noticed that you don’t have a greater fortune martial technique. If you’re interested in joining my Highcloud Realm, I can discuss it with Senior Brother Mu Yan,” smiled Chen Xuan when he saw Lin Yun take the fruit.

But when Lin Yun heard that, he couldn’t help smiling bitterly. The Highcloud Realm might have a good foundation, but he had no intention of joining anyone. However, he was open to suggestions as long as someone didn’t force him.

After a brief consideration, Lin Yun said, “I don’t have any plans of joining a realm. My relationship with Brother Qin is that of partners. However, I like your personality and I’ll remember this favor. In the future, if your Highcloud Realm needs my help, I’ll surely help out.”

Lin Yun really did like Chen Xuan’s personality. If Chen Xuan was like Pei Yu, he wouldn’t have taken the fruit, regardless of its value. But since he took the fruit, he owed Chen Xuan a favor.

Chen Xuan was somewhat disappointed when he heard that but he still smiled, “That works. You can look for me anytime if you change your mind.”

“What arrogance,” sneered Liu Yun. He didn’t think the Highcloud Realm needed Lin Yun’s help. Forget Mu Yan, even Chen Xuan was a lot stronger than Lin Yun. Everyone else from the Highcloud Realm had similar thoughts, but none of them uttered a word since Chen Xuan didn’t.

When the Highcloud Realm’s party was far enough away, Qin Feng came over and whispered, “You should give Highcloud Realm some consideration. Geniuses from higher realms don’t place those from other realms in their eyes. Highcloud Realm is one of the realms that can confront those higher realms. Plus, Senior Brother Mu Yan even has the qualification to enter the Azure Dragon Ranking.”

When Lin Yun heard about the Azure Dragon Ranking, his eyes started flashing. Fang Shaoyu had told him all about it. The Heavenly Path was differentiated into Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise Regions. Those with qualifications would have their name appear on the Heavenly Mirror at the end of Heavenly Path with the region’s ranking.

The Azure Dragon Region naturally had the Azure Dragon Ranking. In the Azure Dragon Region, there were a hundred rankings available out of tens of thousands of geniuses. There was no exception that those who could make it on the rankings were geniuses from various realms, not to mention there were also geniuses from higher realms.

Only those in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm were qualified to make into the ranking, but that was just obtaining the qualification. Lin Yun still had a long way to go to reach the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm, so he wasn’t too bothered at the moment. But when he heard that Highcloud Realm’s Mu Yan had the qualification to make it into the ranking, he couldn’t help marveling at the Highcloud Realm’s foundation.

Sighing, Qin Feng said, “I’m too naive. I don’t have any interest in the Glorysun Spirit now. I just hope that I can come out alive.”

“What’s the matter?” Lin Yun asked.

“Chen Xuan might sound casual about it, but he clearly doesn’t want me to think too much about it. The Flamefeather City is destined to be a battlefield for geniuses from the higher realms. We practically have no chance to obtain the Glorysun Spirit. We can only try and see if we can find other treasures and come out alive,” said Qin Feng.

“The higher realms are that terrifying?” Lin Yun asked.

“You didn’t witness that brutal battle in the beginning because you came late. Those who came in were all top-tier geniuses from the various realms. Why would they bow to the higher realms? In the end, the higher realms slaughtered everyone and showed their might through the massacre,” said Qin Feng with a grave expression on his face.

“The senior brother of my Beaconfire Realm isn’t any weaker than Mu Yan, but he died in that bloodbath. In the end, I can only bring my remaining brothers to Thunderflame City. After all, who wouldn’t want to head to the five astral lands?” Qin Feng’s tone was filled with sorrow when he mentioned the past.

Lin Yun was shocked because the Heavenly Path wasn’t simple.

“Fortunately, those geniuses won’t come to Flamefeather City. Otherwise, we might not have a chance to live. But even so, we have to be careful not to start a conflict with them or we will be dead no matter where we run off to.” The past clearly filled Qin Feng with fear.

Lin Yun kept silent when he heard that because he was shocked. If there were geniuses from higher realms present, he had to take a look at how strong they were.

As night fell, Lin Yun sought a remote region near the camp to refine the Demonic Soul Fruit. When he swallowed the fruit, a black demonic aura started pouring out of the fruit that violently rampaged in his body. Before he could even react, the black aura had spread throughout his body.

Then, the demonic aura turned into flames that filled him with pain as he was being tempered like metal. With each breath, Lin Yun could sense his origin energy, the Azure Firmament Tree, and the Iris Sword Sutra becoming more refined.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At the same time, lightning crackled in the dragon runes on the surface of his body. He had reached the pinnacle of the Azure Dragon Enneaform a while ago and he was faintly showing signs of making a breakthrough. It turns out that the benefits from the Demonic Soul Fruit weren’t just twofold, but threefold!
