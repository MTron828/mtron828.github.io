Chapter 302 - Zhong Yunxiao is Lin Yun!

The inner disciples were hung on the statues on public display for everyone to see. All the disciples who were stopped from entering the next stage got up to express their gratitude. After all, it wouldn’t be so easy for them to enter the Sword Tomb if Lin Yun hadn’t intervened.

At the very least, they would have to pay three Swordcloud Cores. Everyone proceeded to enter the Sword Tomb and many people turned around to look at Lin Yun with shock in their eyes. They didn’t expect that Zhong Yunxiao was actually Lin Yun!

They expected that the entire Burial Sword Peak would be shocked when the news got out. Not only did Lin Yun defeat the inner disciples, but his strength also left a deep impression on everyone present. They imagined that Lin Yun became a lot stronger after refining the Imperial Sword Herb. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so powerful as a cultivator in the fifth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. After all, he was only in the third stage two months ago.

At the same time, there were also those who had ill intentions. Many people already slipped away to spread the news of Lin Yun’s appearance to obtain the bounty reward given by the Gentlemen Union. After all, Wang Yan declared that those who saw Lin Yun would be rewarded 100 second-grade spiritual jades. It was a temptation that no one could resist.

“Junior Brother Lin, you’re not going to stop them from revealing your location?” smiled Lin Qiushan, who was watching the disciples that were leaving. The Sword Tomb no longer had any obstructions, so it made no sense for them to leave. Lin Qiushan instantly predicted that they were going to claim the bounty.

“Let them be. I have no intention of wearing the mask again after removing it.” Lin Yun no longer decided to hide his identity since he used the Dragon-Tiger Fist. Furthermore, he also obtained the Imperial Sword Herb. His cultivation, cultivation technique, and the Flicking Divine Sword had improved.

He had greatly boosted his strength, so he was confident about the second round. After all, there was no need for him to participate in the Alliance-Union Battle if he didn’t have any confidence.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun stepped into the Sword Tomb with anticipation. The final battle was arriving. The eastern gate also had a group of inner disciples blocking the way. They forcibly requested everyone to hand over a Swordcloud Core in order to participate in the second round.

But compared to Mu Ling, they only demanded one Swordcloud Core, which many outer disciples could afford. However, they still gnashed their teeth at the fee. Many outer disciples were observing the situation.

“What a bunch of indecisive people. They want to become inner disciples by being so indecisive? What wishful thinking!” The leader of the inner disciples, Duan Qingshan, looked at the outer disciples with ridicule on his face. The other inner disciples also sneered with pride. They might be ranked in the last one hundred on the Earth Ranking, but they didn’t place any of these outer disciples in their eyes.

“They have no idea about the huge gap between us and them. They’re really naive to come even after knowing that we will also be participating in the Alliance-Union Battle.”

“How many people do you think will be promoted to an inner disciple in this Alliance-Union Battle?”

“How many? It will be good enough if there’s even one who manages to do this. The elders look down on us, so let us play with them when we fight. At that time, we can look at the elders’ faces.” It was a huge shame for them to participate in the Alliance-Union Battle, so these inner disciples were unhappy.

“So cold!” A chill suddenly appeared in the atmosphere that made them shiver. Duan Qingshan’s face changed. He raised his head and saw a person walking over with a sword.

“Stop right there! You need to hand over a Swordcloud Core if you want to enter the Sword Tomb!” The inner disciples barked.

That person raised his head and smirked, which sent shivers in the inner disciples.

“I know you! So it looks like the number one on the Mortal Ranking, Chu Haoyu, is here.” Duan Qingshan smiled when he saw Chu Haoyu. But he had no intention of letting Chu Haoyu pass. At the same time, many outer disciples’ eyes lit up when they saw Chu Haoyu.

“So even though you know me, you still dare to stand in my way?” Chu Haoyu’s indifferent voice sounded out.

The smile disappeared on Duan Qingshan’s face. He sneered, “I heard that you already possess the strength of an Earth Ranking disciple, but you’ve stayed in the Mortal Ranking for one person. In my view, you must be too weak to make it into the Earth Ranking.”

“Senior Brother Duan, why bother talking to him and wasting your time? Just give him a beating.”

“He might be first on the Mortal Ranking, but it’s still the Mortal Ranking. How can he possibly be compared to experts from the Earth Ranking?”

“He’s just a frog in the well. He has no idea how powerful inner disciples are!” The inner disciples placed their hands on the scabbard of their swords.

Chu Haoyu didn’t speak a word. He merely pulled his sword out by half an inch, revealing a cold gleam that dazzled like the sun. When their visions recovered, Chu Haoyu already returned his sword to the sheath. There was only a sword gleam, but no one knew if he had drawn his sword.

An inner disciple thought that Chu Haoyu was afraid and sneered, “First on the Mortal Ranking? Why aren’t you drawing your…”

But before he could finish speaking, a sword gleam flashed through his throat. The inner disciple’s throat was cut.

“Don’t speak!” Duan Qingshan was the only one who managed to avoid Chu Haoyu’s sword. But there was still a faint mark left on his neck. If the sword went half an inch deeper, he would be in the same situation as everyone. Duan Qingshan began to sweat as his face turned pale.

The two other inner disciples held their necks in fear. They didn’t dare to move. They knew that they would affect their injuries if they opened their mouth, which would cause them to die. It felt even more terrible than death.

“That’s the Cloudstun Sword!” Duan Qingshan’s voice trembled with fear. Just how far did he reach with the Cloudstun Sword for it to be so terrifying? Duan Qingshan’s legs began to tremble in fear. He immediately spoke out, “I’ll get lost! I’ll get lost right now!”

Duan Qingshan ran back to the Sword Tomb and didn’t look back.

“Continue holding onto your necks. Perhaps you guys can still survive if you don’t move for half an hour,” said Chu Haoyu with disdain. This scene left all the outer disciples in the surroundings shocked. Chu Haoyu had only used one move to defeat four inner disciples.

At another gate, there was also a group of disciples who launched their attacks. But it felt like their swords struck metal since they were unable to push their swords another inch. The faces of all the inner disciples changed and the person they were fighting sneered before unleashing a counterattack formed by a shockwave.

The four swords broke apart and the inner disciples threw up a mouthful of blood as they were blown away.

“Who are you?!” The inner disciples were shocked by this person’s physique.

“Ye Xiu of the Mortal Ranking.” Ye Xiu stepped into the Sword Tomb without even looking at the inner disciples.

At another gate, the third on the Mortal Ranking, Jiang Feng, sent the inner disciples flying with just a punch. Inner disciples were known for the quality of their origin energy, but they couldn’t even take a palm from Jiang Feng. The inner disciples immediately turned around and ran away. They no longer had any courage to block the path.

Faint disdain could be seen on Jiang Feng’s lips. He smiled, “You want to block the way with only that much strength? It turns out that the Earth Ranking’s disciples aren’t much.”

He had already reached complete mastery with the Originmurk Art. So his cultivation technique was stronger than the spirit cultivation techniques that he faced. When it came to origin energy, he didn’t have to fear anyone.

The news of outer disciples in the top ten on the Mortal Ranking defeating the inner disciples soon spread to the elders on the observation platform, especially those who refined the Imperial Sword Herb. They completely suppressed the inner disciples.

Bai Ting couldn’t close his mouth from smiling when he heard the news. It was just as he had guessed. Those who refined the Imperial Sword Herb had undergone a drastic transformation in their strength. So he was certain that Lin Yun would be killed.

“Report! I’ve just received news that the fourth on the Mortal Ranking, Han Zhengyang, defeated the inner disciple, Zhang Han!”

“The third on the Mortal Ranking, Jiang Feng, suppressed the inner disciples with a palm!”

“The second on the Mortal Ranking, Ye Xiu, defeated four inner disciples with the shock from his physique alone.”

“First on the Mortal Ranking, Chu Haoyu, only used a sword to kill one, heavily injure two, and scare an inner disciple into running away!”

The news was shocking. When everyone heard about Chu Haoyu’s accomplishment, they sucked in a cold breath. He was truly worthy of being the first on the Mortal Ranking. Not even the inner disciples could take a sword from him since they were so easily killed.

But as more news came out, the faces of the Locket Mountain’s disciples turned ugly. If they were so powerful, then didn’t that mean that Lin Yun would have no chance in the Sword Tomb?

Bai Ting smiled. He turned to Luo Feng and grinned, “Old geezer, you can still smile? Didn’t I say that Lin Yun is nothing compared to the people who refined the Imperial Sword Herb?”

“Report!” A person came right at this moment. Bai Ting’s eyebrows frowned when he saw this person. This person was responsible for observing Zhong Yunxiao and he was the one who delivered the bad news previously.

Bai Ting was feeling pretty smug before this person arrived. When he saw the deacon, he couldn’t help cursing in his heart. He waved his hand, “You don’t have to report. I know that Zhong Yunxiao must’ve defeated inner disciples as well. As long as he’s not a piece of garbage, he’s bound to have some harvest after refining the Imperial Sword Herb.”

“That’s not it. Elder Bai, Zhong Yunxiao is Lin Yun, and Lin Yun is Zhong Yunxiao. He destroyed the inner disciples’ Three-Demise Sword Formation with one punch!” The one who came to report had fear written on his face.

“What?!” Everyone was shocked by this piece of news. Zhong Yunxiao is Lin Yun? He even destroyed the Three-Demise Sword Formation with one punch? Doesn’t that mean that they all lost the bet?

The elders and disciples on the observation platform were all shocked. Bai Ting was dumbfounded. He never imagined that the two people he hated the most would be the same person. He immediately stood up from his seat and exclaimed, “That’s impossible! I want the details!”

“Haha. Old geezer, why are you throwing your temper at a subordinate? I’ll tell you about it since you want to hear it.” Luo Feng smiled with his eyes narrowed into slits. He stroked his beard and continued, “Zhong Yunxiao is Lin Yun, and Lin Yun is Zhong Yunxiao. After refining the Imperial Sword Herb, he destroyed the Three-Demise Sword Formation with a single punch!”
