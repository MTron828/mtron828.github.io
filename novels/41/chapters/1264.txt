Chapter 1265 - Ant Lin Yun!

On the island where the Dragon Blood Fruit was born, there was a massacre around the place with every single path guarded by someone from a big sect. After Lin Yun killed the black-clothed youth, he didn’t stop and rushed towards the Dragon Blood Fruit.

Lin Yun’s logic was simple. As long as no one offends him, he wouldn’t offend others. If there was no need, he couldn’t start a meaningless massacre. Very quickly, he left this place and stood on a peak. He could see massacres happening everywhere, and all the Empyreans from the Ancient Barren Domain were practically here. They’re all prideful people, and they were determined to compete even if they weren’t from big sects.

There were many geniuses who shared the same thoughts as Lin Yun. The Ancient Barren Domain was too big. Even if many people weren’t from the big sects, they were strong. There were battles on the other paths with mountains collapsing.

Quasi-saint elixirs were rare, not to mention that it was a five-thousand-year quasi-saint elixir. But the big sects were too strong, making it tough for the other geniuses to break through their blockade. This was happening even though they weren’t on the Profound Wither Island and hadn’t come in contact with those powerful sects. They knew that it would be even bloodier on the island.

This made Lin Yun lament, but his lamentation only lasted for a split second before he bolted towards the location of the Dragon Blood Fruit, killing several big sect disciples along the way. They all had saint artifacts, but they were too lacking when compared to the Jiao-Dragon Saint Tablet.

This made Lin Yun let out a breath. It turned out that the foundation of a big sect wasn’t that shocking, it was just the black-clothed youth.

Four hours later, Lin Yun arrived at the border where the Dragon Blood Fruit was born. There were many people gathered there, and they were all incredibly strong. They managed to break through the encirclement, but they stopped because everyone here was terrifying. They occupied a mountain while looking down on everyone else.

Those were the disciples of the Flame Dragon Sect and Azure Thunder Sect, who were responsible for this location. As for the other locations, they were guarded by the other big sects as well.

At the foot of the mountain, there was a pile of corpses. Behind them, the light of the Dragon Blood Fruit could be seen dying the night red. After taking a deep breath, everyone could feel their vitality boiling.

“Is it going to rain?” Lin Yun looked at where the Dragon Blood Fruit was born. There was a crimson light forming into clouds that made the surrounding atmosphere moist.

In mid-air, the various disciples of the big sects took something out and seemed to be preparing for something. A brief moment later, a blood rain started to fall. But it wasn’t evil and each droplet of blood was as pure as jade, emitting a bright light that contained an unbelievably sacred aura.

“Saint liquid!”

“This is a phenomenon that’s only found in saint elixirs. But the birth of the Dragon Blood Fruit actually caused it to rain saint liquid.”

“Dragon Blood Saint Liquid, I can sense the saint aura within it!”

“Let us go in! We have no interest in the Dragon Blood Fruit, we only want the saint liquid along with the herbs that grow around it.” Those who stopped at the foot of the mountain were furious. After looking at the big sect’s disciples gathering saint liquid, they could only watch because the big sects had stopped them outside the range of the saint liquid. This was simply too cruel.

“Shut it! Death to anyone who steps up!” A woman from the Flame Dragon Sect coldly said, “You guys are only slightly stronger than the other ants, but you guys are still ants. We’re already benevolent to allow you guys to sense the aura of the saint elixir from here!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What gives!”

“Mere ants dare to compete with us? Shut it. We’re already being benevolent by letting you guys watch. If you continue to ramble on, then don’t blame me for being ruthless!” The other Flame Dragon Sect disciples barked.

“Damn it!” Those who made it there were furious, but they didn’t dare to utter a word because the big sects were too terrifying. They were a lot stronger than the countryside disciples, and they were at least in the three thousandths on the Empyrean Ranking. Someone previously tried to intrude but died a terrible death.

“Trouble…” Lin Yun muttered with his eyes cold. The powerful sects have monopolized the saint elixirs and the big sects have monopolized quasi-saint elixirs. This was brutal and this practically cut the chances of other geniuses to rise.

Then again, the cultivating world was brutal and realistic. But if a massacre couldn’t be avoided, then let the corpses pile up to the peak of the martial path!

Lin Yun shut his eyes and began to brew his aura. Those people were strong and he hadn’t manifested his constellation, so he didn’t want to reveal too many trump cards.

“This is too much!” Someone finally couldn’t hold it back after looking at the big sect’s disciples nearly gathering all the saint liquid. They were strong and were on the Empyrean Ranking, but it was a pity that they weren’t from big sects.

“Too much? We’re not being too much but you guys are too useless. How can ants possibly stand against an eagle?” The youth on the mountain said as he became enveloped with lightning. He was from the Azure Thunder Sect. The Azure Thunder Sect had an ancient inheritance, and they had a round moon created with lightning and flame. It was extinguished in ancient times, and they only managed to reignite it in the dark era. This was the reason why they could compete with some powerful sects.

His words made the face of the genius who spoke turn red because they were all geniuses, and they wanted to show off on the Profound Wither Sea. But before they even stepped into the Profound Wither Island, they already suffered such humiliation. So their endurance had reached the limit and began to have thoughts about intruding by force.

The youth on the mountain smiled. “I advise you guys to behave yourselves and don’t do something you guys will regret. You are all geniuses, so it’ll be bad if you guys died.”

“We’re not competing for the Dragon Blood Fruit. Don’t we even have the right to fight for the other herbs that were born along with it and the saint liquid?” A young man yelled.

“Sorry, but you guys really don’t. Otherwise, why would we waste such a great amount of effort? Furthermore, this just some saint liquid and it’s not as good as you think,” smiled that youth.

“That’s the Dragon Blood Saint Liquid, and it’s impossible to find them normally!” Everyone all knew how precious the Dragon Blood Saint Liquid was, and it would be impossible to gather so much even in a hundred years.

“But what has it got to do with you guys?” The woman from the Flame Dragon Sect sneered. “Even if it has a high value, it’s not something you lowly peons can possess.”

Several young men from the Ancient Barren Domain exchanged a glance and wanted to forcibly intrude.

“Such impudence.” The big sect’s disciples on the mountain sneered and weren’t bothered by them. A core disciple of the Flame Dragon Sect made his move with flames gathering in his palm before manifesting it into a hundred rune saint artifact. This was a whip flickering with lightning that was created with the bones of the jiao-dragon.

When the whip appeared, a terrifying aura exploded from it and made the surrounding space tremble. A terrifying flame intent swept out as a faint dragon appeared, emitting a terrifying monarch aura.

“Monarch saint artifact!” Someone exclaimed. The so-called “monarch saint artifact” was a saint artifact with a monarch demonic beast’s soul engraved in it. Furthermore, not just any demonic beast’s soul could be engraved in a saint artifact.

Ordinary demonic beasts wouldn’t be able to bear the pressure of saint runes, only demonic beasts with a powerful bloodline could suppress the saint runes. So monarch saint artifacts were rare and would only appear in big sects.

When the whip appeared, many Empyreans down below knew that the few youths were doomed. The outcome was also just as they had expected. The holy spirit martial techniques unleashed by them were instantly destroyed by the whip. As for them, they were sent flying back at an even faster speed than they came from.

As the dragon unleashed a roar, the youth wielding it lashed his whip out once more, wanting to kill those people who charged forth in order to intimidate the others. But right at this moment, a purple-golden light enveloped with thunderstorms soared into the sky.

Lin Yun also opened his eyes at the same time with his azure dragon aura reaching an unprecedented height. As he soared into the sky, every step he took would cause a rumbling sound while he charged toward the whip head-on.

“What’s going on?” Everyone was shocked while looking at the person who appeared out of nowhere using his physique to confront a monarch saint artifact head-on. This was simply too unbelievable because a monarch saint artifact represented the limit of a saint artifact. In the hand of an Empyrean, that Empyrean could practically be invincible in the Empyrean Realm.

But the youth from the Flame Dragon Sect didn’t give up and lashed his whip once more, unleashing lightning along with a draconic roar. But before the whip could unleash the terrifying dragon aura, it had dispersed by a roar when Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Mark. In the next second, his boundless vitality began to boil while being accompanied by the azure dragon’s roar.

As Lin Yun clashed with the whip once more, the whip was sent flying away this time. This made the youth lock his brows together because he could tell that Lin Yun was strong, and it would make no sense if Lin Yun didn’t have any origin. “Who are you?”

But Yun didn’t reply, just flicked his finger. This caused a sea of flowers to bloom behind him and a sword ray pierced through space, blowing that youth’s head apart before he could even bring out his constellation. This scene instantly left the faces of everyone who was on the island to change and immediately summoned their constellation.

As for the Empyreans who were stopped at the foot of the mountain, they were all shocked by this scene with their jaws wide open.

“Y-Y-You demon! You actually killed my Senior Brother? No matter where you go, the Flame Dragon Sect won’t let you off!” The woman furiously roared as she held onto the whip that the youth previously used.

“Me? I have no intention of running.” Lin Yun smiled before raising his voice, “Ant Lin Yun, wishes to get some guidance from you eagles!”
