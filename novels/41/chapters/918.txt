Chapter 919 - Divine Glorysun Fist

“Kill it!” The four geniuses reached the Dragon-blooded Cat before Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong could make a sound. The one who moved first wore a sinister expression on his face and roared, “Die!”

But the moment he was done shouting, he fell to the ground as his face twisted in pain. No one was able to see what happened.

By the time anyone saw the Dragon-blooded Cat again, it was already in mid-air grinning with ferocity. Then, its sharp claws shot out from its paws with an eerie lustre.

“Watch out!” The remaining geniuses felt a chill run down their spines when they saw the Dragon-blooded Cat’s sharp claws. The cat was simply too fast, so they couldn’t react in time. In the blink of an eye, all three geniuses had claw marks on their chests with blood flowing out.

To Lil’ Red’s claws, the origin energy that surrounded the geniuses was as fragile as paper. With that, the three of them fell to the ground in pain. No matter how much they struggled, they couldn’t get back up.

“H-how is this possible?” The other geniuses from the higher realms were all dumbfounded because Lil’ Red easily defeated everyone. Then, Lil’ Red chuckled and stole one of its victim’s interspatial pouch at blinding speed.

“Bastard, what are you trying to do?!” One of the fallen geniuses yelled at Lil’ Red while clutching his interspatial pouch in desperation. However, Lil’ Red merely gave him a slap on the face. The higher realm genius was lucky that Lil’ Red didn’t use its claws again or else he would have lost his head.

After seizing all interspatial pouches, Lil’ Red sifted through the pouches with disdain growing on its face. The expression on Lil’ Red’s face left everyone dumbfounded.

Seeing that there was nothing good in the interspatial pouch, Lil’ Red tore the genius’ clothes apart. At this moment, the genius was lying on the ground in his underwear. Then, Lil’ Red dragged the jade off his neck and let him go.

“Holy shit, where did this Dragon-blooded Cat come from? It's too intelligent!”

“Haha, isn’t this too pathetic? Geniuses from higher realms were actually robbed by a Dragon-blooded Cat?”

The crowd couldn’t help talking as they watched Lil’ Red strip all four geniuses down to their underwear. At this moment, Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong realized why the Hidden Treasure Pavilion was so empty. With this ancestor around, it would be weird if anything was left behind.

“It’s Lin Yun’s pet!” exclaimed someone with disbelief.

“Holy shit, it is! I recognize it from when Lin Yun blackmailed Xian Yunzhen!” Once Lil’ Red was recognized, the geniuses from the higher realm felt another blow to their egos. No one could utter a single word. After all, Lin Yun already killed two geniuses from the higher realms and his pet robbed the others.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Back in the chamber, Lin Yun carefully sheathed his sword. He could tell that Flower Burial was practically a dao artifact. For now, he should avoid using it. Otherwise, he would disrupt its upgrade.

At this moment, Lin Yun had no idea what was going on outside the barrier. The only thing he knew was that his sword probably tore through the barrier. After all, he executed one of the Three Heavenly Divides.

However, he wasn’t sure if he killed Chen An. Then again, he didn’t care because he was focused on the jade slip at the center of the chamber. He had already examined the arrays and was sure they wouldn’t obstruct him.

Moving quickly, Lin Yun appeared in front of the jade slip without triggering any arrays on the wall.

“Come here!” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up as he grabbed the jade slip.

“Divine Glorysun Fist!” Information started flowing into Lin Yun’s mind as he placed the jade slip against his forehead. Shortly after, the technique summary flowed into his mind. “The Divine Glorysun Fist was created in ancient times by observing the sun. Upon cultivating this technique to a high stage, one can unleash a radiance comparable to the sun.

“This fist technique is an advanced fortune martial technique, and the actual grade depends on the cultivator. It is extremely dangerous and can incinerate you if you aren’t careful. If you don’t have talent or courage, do not practice this.”

Lin Yun opened his eyes and thought deeply about all the information he just received. The technique itself was quite interesting, especially since it wasn’t advised for those without talent or courage.

But what attracted him the most was that it could transcend the boundaries of fortune martial techniques upon completion.

Transcending a fortune martial technique was unimaginable to Lin Yun. Right now, his greatest means were the Three Heavenly Divides that could be ranked among the pinnacle overlord fortune martial techniques. THey were quite a ways from reaching imperial fortune martial techniques, but he could increase its power by relying on his sword intent.

“Well, I have no idea how to complete it so I can ignore that part for now. I’m more curious about the grade I can reach with my talent.” Lin Yun put the jade slip away with deep interest in his eyes. Since the technique relied on his talent, it should at least reach the level of an imperial fortune martial technique.

“Divine Glorysun Fist…” Lin Yun’s face changed just when he was about to leave. The martial technique was left behind by someone, which meant that someone had broken the seal on the Glorysun Spirit. Otherwise, it would be impossible for anyone to leave this cultivation technique in the secret realm created by the Glorysun Spirit.

If that was the case, Lin Yun also had a chance to break the seal on the Glorysun Spirit. Just thinking about it made Lin Yun’s heart start to beat wildly.

“TIme to go!” Lin Yun sped up his pace. Since the seal could be broken, the value of the Glorysun Spirit was completely different.

The other chambers on the path were practically empty, which probably meant that the treasures were only after the first chamber. It was no wonder that Chen An was so emotional after seeing the advanced fortune martial technique

Half an hour later, Lin Yun could feel a blazing fluctuation that made his heart tremble. Executing the Clouds Soaring Art, Lin Yun quickened his pace, “Just a little more.”

After shuttling through dozens of empty chambers, Lin Yun followed the fluctuation to a spacious hall. The only thing in the hall were ancient paintings that hung from the wall. At this moment, he could see all of the phenomena that appeared on the barrier. Right now, there were flaming birds, golden crows, and winged humans. There were also giants enveloped in golden flames with a majestic sun behind them.

Could it be that the phenomena were born within the sun? It made sense since the winged humans and flaming giants felt like deities to him. The discovery was so enlightening that it expanded Lin Yun’s horizon.

Following the tunnel, Lin Yun saw a massive black altar with golden flames.

“The Glorysun Spirit?” Lin Yun’s gaze became heated because the item enveloped in the mysterious golden flames had to be the Glorysun Spirit. However, he knew that he couldn’t act impulsively.

Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to make a move, so he looked around cautiously. There were cracks on the surrounding paintings that seemed to contain complicated runes. They didn’t look like spiritual runes. In fact, Lin Yun couldn’t recognize them at all.

Then, Lin Yun sped around the altar. When he returned to where he started, he was certain that there weren’t any arrays or traps within the hall. “It looks like there aren’t any dangers, at least not until someone touches the Glorysun Spirit.”

But just when Lin Yun was about to take a step forward, an outburst of killing intent poured over. At this moment, Shi Feng was walking out of a tunnel on the opposite side of the hall. “Lin Yun, didn’t I warn you not to go after the Glorysun Spirit?”
