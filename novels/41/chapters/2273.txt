Chapter 2274 - Dragon Sun and Moon Seal

What the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord said was also something everyone wanted to know. After all, Ji Zixi was too protective of Lin Yun, making everyone jealous.

Ji Zixi said, “Let’s not mention that we’re friends outside the God Burial Mountain Range; just the fact that he saved my life in the Flame Dragon Valley is enough. Who the hell do you think you are?”

What she said made sense, and no one could find a problem. Even the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord couldn’t find an issue with it.

“Even without that, the Divine Phoenix Mountain will still protect him as our guest. Those who become enemies of him will become enemies of the Divine Phoenix Mountain! So don’t think that we’re like your Ming Cult!” Ji Zixi raised her brow, unable to conceal her intentions to protect Lin Yun.

The faces of the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord and Crow Shot Saint Lord’s faces became ugly, while the Indigo Brave Saint Lord was rather calm about it. Ji Zixi strongly believed that even the three holy lands couldn’t do anything about it even if they joined forces with their Sovereign Saint Artifacts.

“Hehe. It looks like she has deeply fallen for you.” Li Feibai’s face became rosy behind the crowd under the blue dragon aura and returned to her usual personality.

Lin Yun stopped pouring his blue dragon aura into Li Feibai and looked around with a grave expression.

“What are you looking for?” Li Feibai asked.

“The Blood Moon Divine Maiden’s Wang Muyan,” Lin Yun said. Zhao Tianyu had already hinted that Wang Muyan had been here for a long time. According to what he said, Wang Muyan was the one who instructed Zhao Tianyu to come with the Ying River King. This meant that Wang Muyan must’ve been here a long time ago. But he couldn’t find her anywhere, which made no sense.

“You’re looking for other women when the little princess is protecting you? You’re too heartless,” Li Feibai said with disdain.

Lin Yun looked around, and said, “It’s fine for me to be heartless if I can find her. But most importantly, I can’t find her anywhere.”

Ever since he stepped into the Flame Dragon Valley, he had been trying to look for Wang Muyan. But Wang Muyan was nowhere to be seen even after Zhao Tianyu appeared, which kept him on guard.

After Li Feibai heard what Lin Yun said, her smile disappeared, and her facial expression became grave. She analyzed, “According to what you said, she has a space-time treasure with her. So she can teleport here from afar and inflict a fatal blow.”

“That’s also my speculation. Those hiding in the dark are the hardest to deal with,” Lin Yun said with a grave expression.

“You already have a solution, right? I had guessed something when you went to examine the stone monument,” Li Feibai said.

Lin Yun maintained his silence, making Li Feibai even more confident in her speculation. She just had to follow Lin Yun to be safe.

While the holy lands were in a stalemate, Ji Zixi said, “Let’s cut the crap. If you want to fight, my Divine Phoenix Mountain isn’t afraid. Within the entire Eastern Desolation, even your three holy lands might be unable to do anything to the Divine Phoenix Mirror as long as the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword don’t appear. You guys can try if you guys aren’t convinced!”

That was the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s confidence. The Divine Phoenix Mirror was invincible in the Eastern Desolation as long as the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword didn’t appear.

The Astral River Saint Lord held onto the divine flame fragment with one hand and stroked his beard with the other. He said, “We should leave the Heavenly Void now. I can swear on the Heavenly Dao that we will decide the ownership of the divine flame fragment when we’re out.”

The Ming Cult and Myriad Lightning Sect were furious and reluctant to give up like that. This greatly humiliated them because the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord died while a holy son’s treasure was snatched.

“Let’s agree to it. It’s hard to kill Lin Yun in the Heavenly Void. Even if we can confront the Divine Phoenix Mountain, we can’t do anything to Lin Yun without you guys making a move,” Huang Jingyu’s voice resounded in the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord’s ears. His severed arm was still sending pain to his nerves because removing the sword intent in his wound was hard. After they fought, he finally had a clear gauge of Lin Yun’s strength.

Unless a fourth-stage Saint Lord moves, they could do nothing to Lin Yun, even if all the Saint Lords joined forces. They might even be killed instead!

“Young Sect Master, can you take this lying down?” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord asked.

“Just because we can’t do anything to him in the Heavenly Void doesn’t mean that we can’t do anything to him outside. Tian Xuanzi will be delighted if we capture him and bring him back to the Ming Cult…” Huang Jingyu already had a plan as he coldly looked at Lin Yun. But Lin Yun couldn’t even be bothered to look at him.

Receiving Huang Jingyu’s order, the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord said, “We can let this matter rest if you’re willing to swear on the Heavenly Dao.”

The Crow Shot Saint Lord was reluctant in his heart, while the Indigo Brave Saint Lord heaved a sigh in relief.

“That’s for the best. If Sovereign Saint Artifacts clashed, it wouldn’t be good for us. With the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan’s ambitions, they won’t just watch us fight amongst ourselves, and we might have to join forces at that time,” the Indigo Brave Saint Lord nodded.

“I’m relieved since you’re looking at the bigger picture. After all, we will only benefit the Demonspirit Clan and Blood Moon Sect if we fight amongst ourselves,” the Astral River Saint Lord nodded.

The saint clans and allied forces in the Flame Dragon Valley heaved in relief because they would suffer greatly if a fight occurred.

“Alright. We can be rest assured now. With the five holy lands and their Sovereign Saint Artifacts, even the Blood Moon Sect would have to reconsider appearing before us,” Li Feibai said.

“I hope so,” Lin Yun replied.

“You better be worried about what will happen when you get out. You have a Divine Blood Fruit on you, and you’ve offended the three holy lands. Even the Divine Phoenix Mountain might not be able to protect you,” Li Feibai said as she looked at the nearby Huang Jingyu. “He won’t let this matter rest so easily nor give up. He must be planning something.”

Lin Yun smiled, “He’s just a clown. So there’s no need to worry about him. We only have to send the divine flame fragment out. Besides, no one can stop me from leaving.”

“You're pretty confident in yourself,” Li Feibai said.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“That’s for sure,” Lin Yun replied.

“I hereby swear on the Heavenly Oath…” While they were talking, the Astral River Saint Lord’s radiant voice resounded throughout the entire Flame Dragon Valley, which caused the valley to become quiet.

Everyone’s gazes fell onto the Astral River Saint Lord. The Astral River Saint Lord was strong with his cultivation, possibly as a Saint Sovereign, who took a huge risk in coming to the Heavenly Void But he had achieved his goal of obtaining the divine flame fragment for now.

He was enveloped in a saint radiance that suppressed the divine flame fragment in his hand. The divine flame fragment gave off an ancient power even after being restrained. There were only a couple of people who possessed such strength in the crowd.

Beside him were the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s elders, who didn’t let down their guards as they looked around.

“Those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain are pretty cautious,” Lin Yun shook his head.

“I will keep the divine flame fragment for now. When we leave this place…” While the Astral River Saint Lord was taking his oath, something happened. A crimson moon appeared in the sky. It then started to descend, releasing a great pressure.

“Mhm?” The Astral River Saint Lord frowned and raised his head. The two saint elders beside him also stepped forth and stood before the Astral River Saint Lord.

“Elder Xinghe.” One of the Saint Lords called out.

While the Astral River Saint Lord was puzzled, a hand reached out and patted the Astral River Saint Lord’s chest. This made the Astral River Saint Lord throw out a mouthful of blood with a palm print on his chest, making his face pale.

The seal on the divine flame fragment shattered under the attack and the divine flame fragment broke free. The saint elder who made a move had expected this and swung his hand to take the divine flame fragment.

This sudden scene caught the other Saint Lord by surprise, who was sent flying away before he could even respond. At this moment, that saint elder revealed ‘his’ true appearance. With a bewitching laughter, he continued, “It’s best to let me keep it, instead.”

When Lin Yun raises his head, he realized that this saint elder turned out to be Wang Muyan. This naturally shocked Lin Yun because he never expected that Wang Muyan would be hiding amongst the team from the Divine Phoenix Mountain.

“You demoness!” The Astral River Saint Lord was furious as he dashed forth without a second thought, wanting to retrieve the divine flame fragment.

“Haha! I might have been afraid of you if you were at your peak state. But now…” Wang Muyan smiled as a crimson moon bloomed in her eyes, with her blood beating within her heart like a bright sun.

Two dragons coiled around her hands as she created a circle with her palms, and the two dragons flew out. Her heart the sun, her eyes the moon, and her hands as divine dragons. When a radiance shone out, it made Wang Muyan look like a deity.

“The Dragon Sun and Moon Seal…” Lin Yun opened his mouth, recognizing the martial attack that Wang Muyan was using. She had lost whenever she competed with Lin Yun, but it was different now since she had brought the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal to the deification stage. The Astral River Saint Lord was sent flying away when the seal was formed.

“You don't look so impressive after all.” Wang Muyan smiled with no hint of panic, even when she was within the enemy's reach. After dealing with the Astral River Saint Lord, her hands joined together as a phoenix cry echoed.

“Sun and Moon Unite!” Wang Muyan calmly soared to the sky as her seal changed once more. As the sun and moon shone out, a crimson moon and bright sun appeared in the sky before she was sent flying away.

As the sun and moon revolved, they emitted a terrifying aura that made her look like a deity. When she yanked her hand backward, it looked like she was tugging back heaven with a massive aura sweeping at the Astral River Saint Lord.

A divine phoenix image behind the Astral River Saint Lord shattered, knocking the Astral River Saint Lord back. This made the Astral River Saint Lord throw out a mouthful of blood as he took three steps back.

“Elder Xinghe!” Those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain were anxious and shocked by what happened. When those from the Heavenly Flame Sect, the Ming Cult, and the Myriad Lightning Sect came to their senses, they quickly surrounded Wang Muyan.

“Hand over the divine flame fragment!” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord stood on the cauldron as he roared at Wang Muyan.

The Crow Shot Saint Lord held onto the golden axe as he coldly said, “We never expected this demoness to sneak into the Divine Phoenix Mountain's forces. But don’t even dream about leaving with the divine flame fragment!”

The Indigo Brave Saint Lord didn’t speak but merely held onto his blade, releasing the powerful aura of a Sovereign Saint Artifact, causing the surrounding space to tremble.

Wang Muyan, who was hovering in the sky, smiled, “You guys have such a fiery temper. All of you are so ferocious even when death is imminent. Who said that I wanted to flee? All of you, kneel!”

With a roar, she reached out with her hand and grabbed at the sky.

“The Sovereign Saint Artifacts are nothing before a time-space treasure!” A massive pagoda appeared when the crimson moon in the sky dispersed.

When the heavenly screen appeared, the aura formed by the Sovereign Saint Artifacts was torn apart as the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda appeared.

What Lin Yun was worried about took place after all.
