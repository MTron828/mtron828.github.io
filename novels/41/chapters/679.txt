Chapter 680 - Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s Rage

When he swallowed the fruit, Lin Yun could sense a warm current flowing within his body. As the current flowed, Lin Yun’s injuries began to improve with his face becoming rosy.

The medicinal effect of the fruit brought to him by Lil’ Red was too powerful and it was a little too much for someone so weak. But fortunately, Lin Yun’s physique was strong enough that he wasn’t killed by the medicinal effect.

As Lin Yun’s heart throbbed violently, he circulated the Azure Dragon Enneaform. The azure dragon energy coursed through his body, nourishing his injuries. Not long after, his complexion had returned to normal and his broken bones were recovering at a rapid speed.

Seated on the ground, a dragon roar emitted from Lin Yun’s body that filled his body with an explosive power. The dragon aura contained in the wind and lightning energies made his lean body look like a majestic hill.

A long time later, Lin Yun opened his eyes with his pupils flashing brightly. He was like a dragon that had awakened with its injuries recovered. Normally, he would have needed two days to recover from his injuries, but he recovered in just two hours this time.

Touching his face, he could still sense the tear stain on his face. He muttered, “I cried…”

He had suffered countless bitterness, mockery, and grievance along the way. But his heart was as firm as steel and he would rarely show any fluctuation in his heart. Even so, he was ultimately a human, so he couldn’t bear to see someone suffering for his sake.

He wasn’t afraid of that expert in the greater Yin-Yang stage, but he didn’t want to use the Indigoflame Thunderwhip and alarm that Heavenly Soul Realm expert. This was the reason why he chose to put up with it for the time being. But he never expected that it would cause Lil’ Red to suffer such heavy injuries.

Getting back up on his feet, Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Red’s wounds with his eyes flashing coldly. A sinister expression crept onto his face and he said, “Let’s go and watch a good show.”

He then started to travel through the forest with an indifferent expression. He initially wanted to put the egg in the other Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast’s den to cause the two demonic beasts to fight before retrieving the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s blood essence. But since that asshole Tang Ying wanted it so badly, he was happy to oblige.

If he didn’t crush the egg, it would take roughly half a day for the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture to find out that its egg was missing. But if it was crushed… FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After calculating the time, he knew that time was up. After all, its stuff wasn’t that easy to take.

At the foot of the Lackdragon Slope, the Ironblood Sword Gate’s elites were gathered around a white-clothed youth. He had an extraordinary appearance and temperament. But the cold light flickering in his pupils signified that he wasn’t a pushover.

Beside him was the Heavenly Soul Realm old man, the Ironblood Sword Gate’s sect master, and the vice-sect master.

“Where did he go? The Imperial Sword Herb is about to emerge,” said another vice-sect master with doubt in his face.

Right at this moment, Tang Ying walked over with an unconcealable smile on his face. After all, he had a huge harvest today. He was confident that he could reach the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage as long as he refined the egg.

“Looks like your harvest is pretty good. Was it the brat who trespassed and took the Flamedragon Fruit?” asked the sect master of the Ironblood Sword Gate.

Just when Tang Ying was about to tell the truth, he suddenly rolled his eyes and smiled, “That brat has some background, so I spared his life. I only ensured that he won’t be able to get up for the next three days. I have obtained the Flamedragon Fruit, which the young master can have if he wants.”

“It’s just a Flamedragon Fruit. You can have it if you want. Don’t bother me,” said the white-clothed youth in a cold voice.

“Yes, yes, yes. I have scouted the place and there isn’t anyone else aside from the men of my Ironblood Sword Sect,” said Tang Ying.

Right at this moment, the entire Lackdragon Slope began to tremble.

“What’s going on?”

“Is the Imperial Sword Herb emerging?” The three from the Ironblood Sword Sect and the white-clothed youth frowned their brows together.

“No, it’s not time yet.” The Heavenly Soul Realm expert beside the young man suddenly looked at a direction before changing his face, “It’s the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture!”

Tang Ying curled his lips, “God knows what’s wrong with this beast. But it won’t dare to come to the Lackdragon Slope.”

The sword intent hovering in the sky was extremely lethal. It was still alright for human cultivators, but it would attack if any demonic beast dared to intrude. After all, this place was a forbidden ground for demonic beasts and not even the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was an exception.

But as the irritated roar got closer and closer, this made everyone on the Lackdragon Slope nervous.

“Something isn’t right.” The Heavenly Soul Realm expert shot out and he could sense a terrifying aura approaching.

“Damn it, it’s really the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture!” The Heavenly Soul Realm expert’s face changed as his expression became grave.

“W-what’s going on?” The three from the Ironblood Sword Gate’s faces sank.

Right at this moment, a small herb suddenly bloomed as it released an emerald glow before the white-clothed youth. This was a sign that the Imperial Sword Herb was emerging.

“Damn it! What’s going on?!” The white-clothed youth’s face sank. The Imperial Sword Herb was emerging and the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture coincidentally rushed over. So how could he refine it in peace?

“Prepare to stop this beast!” The Heavenly Soul Realm expert said as he unleashed his aura.

“Prepare the Ironblood Sword Array!” The Ironblood Sword Gate’s sect master said coldly with his voice empowered by his origin energy.

The moment he gave the order, the thousand elites that were present drew their swords and linked them together. In the next second, a boundless aura exploded out from them with a crimson fog spreading out.

When the Ironblood Sword Array began to circulate, an aura not any weaker than the Heavenly Soul Realm expert soared into the sky.

“It’s coming?” Lin Yun raised his head to look at where the violent aura was coming from. It was the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

“The show has finally begun,” smiled Lin Yun as he watched the colossal shadow approaching. When the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture approached, the ground began to tremble and the disciples who had formed an array couldn’t help turning pale.

After all, this was the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture, a Heavenly Soul Realm overlord demonic beast. Looking at the colossal being, their hearts sank and they felt like they had just stepped into hell.

Suddenly, a crack appeared on the ground that reached the border of the Lackdragon Slope. This made everyone’s faces change as two small hills dropped down on them before they could even react. It was the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture who sent two hills flying over by flapping its wings.

The huge shadow from the two hills instantly enveloped everyone as the faces of the Ironblood Sword Sect’s disciples changed. When the Heavenly Soul Realm expert saw the two hills, his face changed with a cold light flashing through his pupils. Then, he made a move and unleashed a sword ray.

Simultaneously, the Ironblood Sword Gate’s sect master and vice-sect masters unleashed a crimson sword ray from the sword array and into the sky. The huge clash crushed the two hills and rocks began to rain down like a meteor shower.

Because of this, many Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples were hit and lost their lives. In their initial encounter, the Ironblood Sword Gate had suffered a huge loss even before the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture showed itself.

As a shadow enveloped everyone, their faces turned ugly.

“This is just the beginning,” said Lin Yun as he wasn’t bothered by the Ironblood Sword Gate’s losses.

When the rocks were all destroyed, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s figure finally appeared. It flapped its wings and unleashed lightning onto the sword array. Under the barrage of thunderbolts, the disciples of the Ironblood Sword Gate began to throw up blood. But the sword array was powerful, so it prevented the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s attack from ruining the Imperial Sword Herb.

“You’re courting death!” Looking at the damaged sword array, the Heavenly Soul Realm expert roared as he soared into the sky.
