Chapter 2388 - Beginning of the Banquet

Amongst the group, there was someone who looked young and arrogant. This was Di Feng, who was a primordial beast and was the influential figure from the third testing ground. Shortly after, a Golden-Winged Roc flew over with a beauty standing on it, captivating everyone’s attention. Her appearance instantly made everyone excited, with their gazes becoming heated.

Lin Yun couldn’t help looking at this person. This woman donned a silver dress that outlined her perfect figure.

Yue Weiwei explained, “She’s Xia Qingyun, known to be the most beautiful woman in Heaven’s Gate, and she’s also the descendant of a deity.”

Lin Yun merely smiled and recollected his gaze. They saw more geniuses from the other testing grounds, and this was an eye-opening experience for spectators like Ao Jue. But compared to them, Lin Yun looked more composed and insignificant.

“It’s unlike you to keep such a low profile, Flower Burial.” A white-clothed youth appeared beside Lin Yun, wearing a smile.

Lin Yun didn’t know this person, but he looked young, in his teens. However, he used a mature tone in his speech, and Lin Yun noticed that this person was a swordsman with an extraordinary cultivation. He asked, “I don’t think I know you. You’ve seen me at the ninth testing ground?”

“It’s enough for me to know you,” the white-clothed youth smiled.

“Where did this brat come from? Big Brother Lin isn’t keeping a low profile, he’s just waiting to soar!” Xiong Tiannan said, looking at the white-clothed youth. He continued, “Just you watch. After the Heavenly Barren Banquet, Flower Burial’s name will spread throughout the Heaven’s Gate Star and three thousand realms.”

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled upon hearing that, while the white-clothed youth smiled, “Okay. I’ll wait for when that happens.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The white-clothed youth left after that.

“He looks familiar for some reason,” Lin Yun muttered as he headed over to the Heavenly Saint Courtyard, where he saw Xi Yuan waiting for them. With Xi Yuan leading, the remaining journey was smoother before they came to a massive stage, the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage, where Saints could fight. The stage had a long history, and it was also used to hold various martial competitions, aside from the banquet.

In front of the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage was a massive platform with a throne at the far end of it. That throne belonged to the sect master, who released a powerful aura. On both sides of the throne were key figures of Heaven’s Gate, such as Profound Sky Venerable and other guests who were invited over. The Golden-Winged Roc was beneath the throne, and Xia Qingyun was in her seat.

Beside her was a handsome youth, looking around without concealing his arrogance. He stood next to Xia Qingyun, and they looked like a perfect couple. When everyone saw him, their eyes trembled. Someone whispered, “He’s Ye Wuhen, right?”

Ye Wuhen was the most talented disciple of Heaven’s Gate, and he had long been accepted as a direct disciple of the ancestral deity. He might be young, but he was famous throughout the three thousand realms, outshining his peers. It was also said that he was now the most beloved disciple of the ancestral deity.

“Wuhen, you won’t become master’s most beloved disciple after this banquet,” Xia Qingyun said with a smile.

“Someone who can compete with me isn’t born yet,” Ye Wuhen said, exhibiting his pride.

Xia Qingyun merely smiled but said nothing because this junior brother was entertaining to tease. It didn’t take long for the other disciples of the ancestral deity to arrive. They stood on the same level as the throne and were even higher than Profound Sky Venerable. This was because the sect master was also the ancestral deity’s disciple and was much older than them.

They were calm and composed, but they shone brightly by just standing there. This made many people envious because who wouldn’t want to become the ancestral deity’s disciple like them?

As long as they could become the ancestral deity’s disciple, they would be on the same level as those older generations who were a few thousand years old.

As time passed, more people began to gather, and the surrounding area was soon filled with people. Because of the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity, the Heavenly Barren Banquet would be the focus of the three thousand realms each time, and many people have been preparing for many years for this day.

Ten-odd figures flew out from the Heavenly Saint Courtyard, and each of them gave off a powerful aura as an Emperor. They stood on a cauldron, and the patterns began to light up, forming into multiple dragons. This was the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron.

At the center was the sect master, Luo Tianxi, with thirty-six Venerables around him, including Profound Sky Venerable. This immediately captivated everyone’s attention, including the other disciples of the ancestral deity, who respectfully looked at Luo Tianxi.

Luo Tianxi was also called the Heavenly Seal Emperor, the strongest beneath the Deity Realm, and he was only three hundred years old. It was an unfathomable achievement to reach the limit of the Emperor Realm in just three hundred years. But the ancestral deity personally taught him, so it was understandable.

“We greet the sect master!”

“Greetings, Heavenly Seal Emperor!” Everyone respectfully greeted Luo Tianxi.

Luo Tianxi looked young, like he was in his twenties, but he gave off a powerful aura. With a wave of his hand, the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron landed not far from the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage. When the ground trembled, the dragons in the surroundings returned to the cauldron.

When Lin Yun sat down, his eyelid twitched while his attention was captivated by the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron since he had seen it again. He originally thought that he wouldn’t be able to see it again.

It's no wonder why Profound Sky Venerable warned me not to go after the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. So, the master is the sect master. I wonder if the sect master has discovered what I did... I hope not... Lin Yun inwardly muttered.

The Blue Dragon Divine Seal was taught to him by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity, so no one should be able to discover it, aside from the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity. Just when he was pondering, he noticed a gaze directed at him. This alarmed Lin Yun, and he saw that it was from Profound Sky Venerable when he raised his head.

The Profound Sky Venerable was glaring at him because everyone was showing their respect for the sect master while Lin Yun’s attention was on the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. This startled Lin Yun into shifting his gaze, pretending he didn’t see Profound Sky Venerable.

On the throne, Luo Tianxi smiled, “All of you aren’t here for me anyways, so there’s no need to be so respectful. With all the geniuses in the three thousand realms gathered in the Heavenly Barren Banquet, you can perform yourselves during this banquet, and you don’t have to care about the identity of your background. If anyone dares to take revenge for it, I will slay that person myself.”

His words were calm, but it made everyone quiet, and they could sense a terrifying murderous intent coming from Luo Tianxi. After all, everyone who came to the Heavenly Barren Banquet had a vast background, and who knew if someone would take revenge for what happened during the banquet? So, Luo Tianxi’s words were equivalent to a layer of guarantee.

“My master has injected heavenly dao fortune to create a monument, and the top thirty can enter the Heavenly Barren Monument. The top ten can become my master’s outer disciple, and the top three have a chance to become his direct disciple. At the same time, my master has a fair request.”

Everyone became excited after hearing what Luo Tianxi said. The rumors were true, and the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity had created a monument himself, and they would receive huge benefits if they could engrave their names on it, which was heavenly dao fortune.

Even Lin Yun’s eyes lit up since the fortune from three thousand realms must be much stronger than the Kunlun Realm. But he also noticed that only the top three would have a chance to become the ancestral deity’s direct disciple.

All the geniuses were excited with fighting spirits blazing in their eyes.
