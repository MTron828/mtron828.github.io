Chapter 1921 - Embrace

While Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword, the surrounding scattered snowflakes gathered around him. In the blink of an eye, the snowflakes moved, turning into silver rays, before forming a massive vortex. The vortex looked like a star vortex with sword rays rippling like comets.

Wang Yue destroyed the incoming comets, but he also retreated and soon reached the edge of the stage with half of his body outside the stage.

When Lin Yun held onto the sword, his attack reached its peak, and a crimson sword ray flashed across the silver comets. Not only was the Heavenly Incineration Sword suppressed, but Wang Yue’s attacks were also broken through. He tried his best to dodge, but Lin Yun’s attack still pierced through his left chest with blood splashing around.

Wang Yue Flew back, and the Nether Orchids on the ground also flew off the stage with him.

“It’s the Divine Firefly Sword again!”

“Just how many sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword does he know?”

“Isn’t this a little too unbelievable?” All the Saint Elders on the Heavenly Dao Altar dropped their jaws in disbelief because Ye Qingtian had given them too many surprises today.

Initially, they thought that the difference between Ye Qingtian and Wang Yue had to be calculated in years, at least two years of differences between them. This was because Wang Yue grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, his cultivation was at the Nirvana Stage, and he even practiced the Heavenly Incineration Sword. Most importantly, he grasped the Life Intent, which not even Saint Elders could grasp.

On the other hand, Ye Qingtian had nothing comparable to Wang Yue besides his sword attainment. Not to mention Wang Yue’s attainment of the sword wasn’t weak, and he could be considered a genius swordsman.

They thought he was only slightly beneath Ye Qingtian. But when they fought, that was completely not the case as Ye Qingtian displayed his advantage in sword dao to the limit and quickly suppressed Wang Yue.

When everyone saw that Wang Yue was about to lose, the Nether Orchids swiftly formed a wall behind him. The wall was like a screen before Wang Yue gently tapped on the wall and flew over at an even faster speed.

When he clashed swords with Ye Qingtian, they both took ten-odd steps back and were surprised. Ye Qingtian’s palm was torn open, blood dripping down the Flower Burial Sword. He also felt an intense pain in his right arm, with fine cracks on his bones.

“My cultivation is my disadvantage, and it will be shown upon facing an opponent with powerful martial intent. If I want to catch up, I’ll either make a breakthrough in my sword intent or my cultivation, reaching the Nirvana Stage.” Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Physique to nurture his injuries. But he was surprised to realize that the energy Wang Yue left within his body was alive, and he had difficulty resolving it.

It wasn’t easy on Wang Yue, either. Lin Yun’s sword would’ve pierced his chest if he had been slightly slower earlier. At that time, he would be crippled, even if he didn’t die, and he could just give up on the Ranking Battle.

“You’re really a monster to grasp so many sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword while being at the Profound Death Stage. The outcome will become uncertain if my martial intent wasn’t the bane of your nether sword aura. But…” Wang Yue changed his tone and said, “You’re only at the Profound Death Stage. Since you failed to defeat me in one go, you won’t be able to beat me!”

He was confident in himself that he wouldn’t suffer greatly like before.

“Blooming Nether Orchid!” Wang Yue swung his sword, and Nether Orchids appeared on the ground once again. He was cautious this time, knowing that the pressure of the Heavenly Incineration Sword couldn’t do anything to Ye Qingtian, and he no longer executed it and used the Nether Orchid Sword instead. He no longer competed with Ye Qingtian in the sword and decided to use his martial intent instead, using Life Intent to curb Ye Qingtian’s nether sword aura. This could further expand his advantage.

On the other hand, Lin Yun was placed in a dilemma. To avoid exposure, he couldn’t use his two saint physiques, the Azure Dragon Sword Technique, and many trump cards. So he was naturally placed in a difficult position after several exchanges with Wang Yue.

“I see… You’re a witty one…” Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling, looking at the endless Nether Orchids. He immediately began to spin, and his sword rays began to intertwine. Very quickly, four shields appeared around him with a black tortoise aura pouring out beneath Lin Yun’s feet.

“Tortoise runes?”

“Is that the black tortoise aura? When the Black Tortoise Saint Runes are formed, even a Quasi-Saint will have difficulty finding a flaw.”

“Ye Qingtian possesses the Black Tortoise’s inheritance?!”

“Isn’t his talent in the sword a little too terrifying to even grasp the sword technique of the Black Tortoise’s lineage? Just what did he experience in the past year?”

“The Profound Thunder Sword Technique.” Wang Muyan was inwardly shocked. The Profound Thunder Sword Technique was long lost, even within the Black Tortoise’s lineage. This piqued her interest in Ye Qingtian even more, and she began to wonder who he really was. The reason why she came here naturally wasn’t because she had taken a fancy to Ye Qingtian but here to observe him.

But the more she observed Ye Qingtian, the more shocked she became. Ye Qingtian first executed the Divine Firefly Sword to a shocking level even to the Saint Elders, and he now displayed the Profound Thunder Sword Technique.

Boundless vitality charged towards Ye Qingtian’s sword aura, but it was knocked back instead. This naturally made Wang Yue anxious because he would have to reveal more trump cards if this went on. He never expected Ye Qingtian to know a tortoise sword technique, despite having such a cocky personality. There was no way he could find a way to break through at all.

Wang Yue quickly became anxious and soon realized that Ye Qingtian had disappeared. Ye Qingtian’s sword aura changed from defense to offense, and his sword ray turned into a thunder serpent that dashed forth.

This knocked Wang Yue’s sword out of his hand, and the thunder serpent bit his wrist before he could respond. But Lin Yun didn’t stop there; he turned around and disappeared. A massive thunder serpent appeared and coiled around Wang Yue when he reappeared.

Wang Yue was tangled, with only his left hand free. His left hand swiftly manifested into a giant hand that was strangling the thunder serpent’s head.

“Wang Yue, you won’t admit defeat even after losing your sword?” Lin Yun asked indifferently.

But Wang Yue had no intention of lowering his head. He coldly said, “You’re sinister. You were a tortoise a moment ago, then turned into a venomous python the next.”

He had long heard of Ye Qingtian, a despicable person who bullied the weak and feared the strong. Not to mention Ye Qingtian once lurked within the Celestial Pool for a month just to peek at the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden. He now knew that the rumors weren’t fake, and even the sword technique he practiced was shameless.

“The Profound Thunder Sword Technique is a sword technique consisting of defense and offense. If you’re not convinced about it, we can continue our fight,” Lin Yun said, wanting to dash forth once again.

“I admit defeat!” Wang Yue immediately admitted defeat after seeing that Ye Qingtian wanted to charge over. But his pupils were filled with unwillingness, and he said, “Just you wait. I’ll find a way to break your sword technique when I charge out from the Loser Group.”

In reality, he still had trump cards left. But he was already injured today, with his chest pierced through and his wrist injured. If he continued to fight and used all his trump cards, he would lose the fight. But he was determined that he could win if they fought again.

“You’re smart, but smart people often ruin themselves with their cleverness. Take your sword and get lost!” Lin Yun sheathed his sword, and the thunder serpent coiling around Wang Yue dissipated.

Wang Yue was intelligent, but it was a pity that he was too confident in himself. So what if Wang Yue could break through his thunder serpent? Lin Yun had grasped the Divine Firefly Sword and had four swords he hadn’t unleashed. But those were trump cards he saved for himself.

With this victory, Lin Yun made it to the next round. The Ranking Battle continued, but Lin Yun didn’t stay behind. He planned to go back to carry on cultivating.

“Stop right there!” When Lin Yun wanted to leave, two figures stood in his path. They were Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan.

Ye Feifan coldly said, “Senior Brother Ye, I’m surprised you made so much improvement in just one year.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“What’s the matter? Are you jealous?” Lin Yun smiled. “Why don’t you ask the ancestors to let you refine half a Saint Origin?”

“Hmph. Your improvements have nothing to do with Saint Origin. Our clan doesn’t have the Profound Thunder Sword Technique. So where did you get it from?” Ye Feifan asked coldly. “You’re not Ye Qingtian. Who the hell are you?!”

“Ye Qingtian was a piece of trash a year ago, and he couldn’t have learned six sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword in just one year!” Zhang Yue raised his head.

Lin Yun already predicted that this day would come. His identity would be doubted no matter how he mimicked Ye Qingtian.

“The Divine Firefly Sword isn’t all I know. If you want to experience it, I don’t mind playing with you. Get lost quickly, and don’t force me to take out the saint medal and make it ugly for you guys,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

When Lin Yun mentioned the saint medal, Ye Feifan and Zhang Yue’s faces changed. The corner of Ye Feifan’s lips twitched, and he immediately cowered, not daring to directly look at Lin Yun.

“Haha. What are you two saying? If he’s not Ye Qingtian, the Saint Elder would’ve exposed him when he went on the Heavenly Dao Altar.” Wang Muyan’s laughter resounded as she walked over. As she blinked her eyes, she embraced Lin Yun’s waist, “You two bastards. Do you two think that you are smarter than the Saint Elder? Ye Qingtian is my love, and you think I can’t recognize my lover?”

Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan were shocked upon hearing that and their eyes bulged out.
