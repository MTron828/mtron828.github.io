Chapter 2059 - Sky Incineration Flames (1)

Myriad Swords Unite against Myriad Swords Unite, Astral Sword Intent against Astral Sword Intent.

They were both using the Divine Firefly Sword, but the momentum released by their attacks was completely different. A dragon and phoenix accompanied Lin Yun’s phenomenon, while Zhao Wuji’s phenomenon was flames and black lotuses covering the sky.

Their strongest attacks clashed together, causing a huge wave on the lake. But because Lin Yun’s attack was slightly weaker, he spread his arms apart and flew back, reaching the border of the lake like a swallow.

“Do you think you can escape?” Zhao Wuji held onto his sword with one hand behind him. When he stomped on the lake, it created a huge wave, and he dashed over.

But right then, Lin Yun called off his sword aura and gathered it on the lake's surface, creating huge waves. The waves carried him up, and Lin Yun didn’t take long to be above Zhao Wuji.

“Withered Tree Coming To Life!” Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword and poured his nirvana aura into the sword, creating an ancient and massive tree that rose from the ground, covering the entire sky. As leaves drifted down, Lin Yun swung his sword.

“Excellent swordsmanship!” Zhao Wuji smiled and blocked the incoming sword. The momentum behind the sword forced him to retreat a few hundred meters before Zhao Wuji could stabilize his footing. If it was someone else in his position, that person would be sent flying away.

But Zhao Wuji was different. Two curtains rose from the lake on both sides when he slid across the lake. Zhao Wuji swiftly regained his footing and managed to avoid the strongest part of Lin Yun’s attack.

While Zhao Wuji avoided Lin Yun’s attack, Lin Yun swung his sword down again. His attack tore apart the lake’s surface, creating a huge splash. The splashed water was as clear as ordinary water, but it was spiritual sacred goldwater that was comparable to a saint artifact. It wasn’t easy to cause a ripple on the lake, not to mention a splash.

When Lin Yun moved over the lake, his figure was ethereal and nimble, appearing as though he was dancing on the lake. He was like a sword immortal at this moment as he charged at Zhao Wuji.

On the other hand, Zhao Wuji executed the Black Lotus Nine Transformations to the limit, fully exhibiting the profundity of this movement technique, with his figure becoming blurred from his speed.

But when Lin Yun executed the Divine Sunchasing Art, he successfully caught up with Zhao Wuji.

“Rising Sun!” With his sword aura, Lin Yun soared to the sky, gathering the splashes. When Lin Yun focused his sword aura on the splashes, the splashes soon became heated and turned into a metallic fireball in the blink of an eye. The high temperature immediately started causing the lake to evaporate.

When Zhao Wuji looked at the blazing sun, he turned around and dashed forth with his sword, unleashing a sword ray the size of ten feet. He split the sun into two, but that wasn’t all. Zhao Wuji’s sword continued towards Lin Yun.

The sword ray Zhao Wuji unleashed was black and covered with densely packed scriptures. When the sword ray flew forth, it even managed to split the space in its path, and Lin Yun would have been dragged into the sword ray if he wasn’t careful.

Zhao Wuji remained standing in the same spot with a black lotus blooming beneath him. When Zhao Wuji swung his sword, black sword rays covered in scriptures, looking like lotus petals, were flying over. As his sword rays intertwined in the air, it didn’t take long for the surroundings to be covered in weird scriptures.

Lin Yun was in mid-air as he stepped on the water splashes. He was moving around in the air like a dragon, dodging the incoming attacks before landing on the winged dragon statue.

Zhao Wuji is truly worthy of being a genius of the Black Plume Palace. Whether it was his attainment in sword dao, his foundation in martial techniques, the density of his nirvana aura, or the strength of his physique, none of these could normally be achieved at the Nirvana Stage. Lin Yun’s thoughts processed swiftly as he stood on the winged dragon statue, evaluating Zhao Wuji’s strength.

If Zhao Wuji brought out his full strength, even a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase would have difficulty inflicting injuries on him. This meant Lin Yun couldn’t treat Zhao Wuji as an ordinary cultivator at the Nirvana Stage. Zhao Wuji could be considered as a Quasi-Saint Realm expert.

“Even Zhao Wuji can’t defeat him so easily, and they’re evenly matched?! Zhao Wuji is someone whose Astral Sword Intent has reached lesser mastery!” Feng Shengling exclaimed with disbelief at the palace.

Seeing this, Gu Zijin smiled, “Feng Shengling, haven’t you noticed it yet? Ye Qingtian’s Astral Sword Intent is also at lesser mastery or even stronger!”

“What?!”

Gu Zijing’s words were a huge blow to Feng Shengling. Feng Shengling was previously pondering why the difference between him and Ye Qingtian was so huge. After all, Feng Shengling couldn’t even touch the corner of Ye Qingtian’s clothes. Even so, the thought of Ye Qingtian’s Astral Sword Intent reaching lesser mastery never crossed Feng Shengling’s mind because it was too unbelievable.

Theoretically, if someone had reached the initial stage in Astral Sword Intent, they could reach lesser mastery if they had enough resources. But a swordsman’s comprehension had to follow up, or it would bring more harm than benefits.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

If the swordsman didn’t have enough comprehension to back it up when reaching lesser mastery, they wouldn’t be able to refine the saint fruits that contain sword intent. When that happens, it could lead to serious complications.

Otherwise, based on the Hidden Sword Manor's resources, Feng Shengling’s Astral Sword Intent would have reached greater or complete mastery long ago.

Hearing what Gu Zijing said, Feng Shengling was shocked and exclaimed, “Can it be that he’s really a rare genius within the past five hundred and the next five hundred years?”

“I don’t know about that. But if his Astral Sword Intent didn’t reach lesser mastery, he would’ve lost to Zhao Wuji long ago,” Gu Zijing said.

Feng Shengling’s face was pale, and he finally realized how naive he was to claim they were both geniuses. He was still thinking of using Ye Qingtian as his stepping stone. But it turned out that he wasn’t even qualified to become Ye Qingtian’s stepping stone. The difference in their talent wasn’t just five hundred years!

Although Gu Zijing might appear calm, he was also deeply shocked within his heart and even felt a hint of envy. To have such talent at such a young age, Gu Zijing couldn’t imagine how far Ye Qingtian could reach.

“This fellow has really hidden himself deeply back then. I never expected him to be so strong, and even Flower Burial might not be any stronger than him.” Amongst the spectators, An Ziyun’s gaze was on Ye Qingtian. She suddenly realized that Ye Qingtian was pretty dashing.

“Didn’t you say that he’s a lecher?” Ye Ziling asked.

“That’s back then, and it’s different now. I’m now suspecting if he truly loved the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden,” An Ziyun said.

Ye Ziling smiled when she heard that. She had to admit that she was shocked by Ye Qingtian’s strength. She now knew why Peak Master Mu Chuan wanted her to become acquainted with Ye Qingtian. Now that she looked at him, the peak master’s eyesight was extraordinary.

“Zhao Wuji is strong, but Ye Qingtian might really win the fight,” Ye Ziling said seriously.

Zhao Wuji stood on the black lotus with two black cloths fluttering behind him. Even if he didn’t make a move, there was an invisible sword intent enveloping him with the reciting of scriptures that could be heard.

This was a profound sword technique and the strongest inheritance of the Black Plume Palace. Zhao Wuji hadn’t grasped the Sword Heart, but the vibrating sword intent would shred anyone who stepped within a ten-foot radius around him. He was strong in the eyes of others, and he was a genius on a whole new level compared to everyone else.

Lin Yun stood on the wing dragon statue wielding his sword. When he looked at Zhao Wuji, he didn’t dare to underestimate this person.

If I execute the Sword of the Beginning, I have 90% odds of defeating him. Lin Yun pondered but soon rejected that idea. The Light of the Beginning could also be considered the beginning of nirvana, and it was one of his strongest trump cards. Two formidable figures were watching the palace. He could reveal this trump card, but it shouldn’t be revealed so easily unless necessary.

“Moon Shattering Black Lotus!” Zhao Wuji broke the silence and leaped to the sky, looking as though he stirred up a moon from the lake with the sword in his hand. This was a ghost spirit martial technique from the Black Plume Sword Canon, and it was comparable to an entry-level dragon spirit martial technique. It goes without saying, this was naturally a powerful sword technique. It could even be considered a dragon spirit martial technique, to a certain extent.
