Chapter 1725 – Great Boost in Strength

Within the Nine Lotus Diagram, Lin Yun had no idea of the bet between Yue Weiwei and Mu Xueling. He was having a peaceful interaction with the nine lotuses within the painting. The nine saint lotuses would take turns cultivating with him. He needed their divine rune energy, and they needed his vitality that the Blue Dragon Bone had purified.

The two complemented each other, and merely took what they needed. After all, the Nine Lotus Diagram should be dangerous, and yet, suddenly, Lin Yun didn’t want to leave. The Nine Lotus Diagram was simply the perfect place to cultivate, regardless of his mental cultivation or physique, they both greatly benefited from it, especially the improvement of his mental cultivation.

The only regret would be his cultivation. This place might be filled with spiritual energy, but it wasn’t easy to quickly reach the sixth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. But Lin Yun wasn’t anxious about that because he still had six leaves of the Divine Blood Fruit.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun swallowed a leaf. This was the first time he refined the leaves after he had recovered from his injuries. It might be impossible for him to make a breakthrough with the spiritual energy here, but it shouldn’t be a problem since he had the leaves. If he couldn’t, he would just have to consume another leaf.

After all, he might as well use all the available resources he could. Since he was injured in the past, the leaf could only strengthen his mental cultivation. Now that he had fully recovered, he no longer had any reservations. He did need a boost in his cultivation now since it needed to catch up to his sword dao. He couldn’t unleash the full power of his sword dao with his cultivation at the sixth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

His cultivation was his greatest weakness when compared to those with a high rank on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. After all, his opponents wouldn’t just have a friendly spar with him. He might lose terribly if they relied on the advantage of their cultivation.

Time passed, and two months passed in the blink of an eye. In addition to the month before cultivating within the Nine Lotus Diagram, Lin Yun had stayed in the Heavenly Fragrance Treasury for nearly three months, which was a somewhat unbelievable amount of time.

If Mu Xueling didn’t have an ongoing bet with Yue Weiwei, she would’ve long come in. But because of the bet between them, the two practically forgot about it. Mu Xueling would spend her time reading books or supervising Yue Weiwei’s Nine Heavenly Profound Dance with the pavilion master. But without the help of the Ni Chang Dress Song, her improvement significantly slowed down.

But thanks to her astonishing comprehension and her mental state being better than before, she was still making constant improvements in the Nine Heavenly Profound Dance. Her figure was light as she danced on the snowy mountain’s lake, basking in the saint radiance shining down from the sky.

“Senior Sister!” Yue Weiwei’s eyes lit up. She continued, “Senior Sister, your saint origin is a lot clearer than before. It looks like you’ve made quite the progress in this period. I’m afraid it won’t take long for you to become a saint.”

Mu Xueling had long become a Quasi-Saint, and she wasn’t just an ordinary Quasi-Saint. She had already grasped saint dao to a certain degree and just needed time to smoothly become a saint. Her bottleneck shook when she saw Lin Yun’s performance back at the Cloud Fragrance Hall, significantly shortening the time for her to become a saint.

“You’re really patient. You didn’t even come and look for me in the past two months.” Mu Xueling gently brushed the accumulated snow on Yue Weiwei’s head.

“Hehe. Senior Sister, are you going to admit defeat now?” Yue Weiwei chuckled.

“You’re not worried about his life and death? He already went in for so long, so he should’ve reached his limit, even with the Blue Dragon Bone. Even if he were barely holding on, he definitely wouldn’t dare to stay on the altar.” Mu Xueling asked. “It’s pointless for him to stay any longer. He won’t be able to absorb mental energy from the divine runes after reaching a certain height.”

“I believe in Big Brother Lin.” Yue Weiwei smiled.

When Mu Xueling looked at Yue Weiwei, she was briefly stunned because she could tell that the latter was serious. This piqued her interest even more. She was curious about what the two experienced for Yue Weiwei to hold such strong confidence in Lin Yun.

“There must be something special about him since he can acquire his current achievement. But the Nine Lotus Diagram isn’t as simple as you think. Staying longer you, doesn’t mean it’s the better. We must bring him out three days from now, no matter what. Otherwise, I can’t ensure that he might damage his foundation.” Mu Xueling said.

“Big Brother Lin can do it.” Yue Weiwei said, keeping her smile.

Three days later, Lin Yun was enveloped in a golden radiance as he sat on the lotus within the Nine Lotus Diagram. There was a heavenly dragon and a divine phoenix on his left and right sides. Behind him were multiple dragon pulses over a hundred feet.

There were seven dragon pulses behind him, which meant that his cultivation had reached the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. The nine saint lotuses were around him, but they didn’t devour much of his vitality. Lin Yun had nine light rays that connected him with the saint lotuses.

But he wasn’t devouring the divine runes’ energy from the saint lotuses. Ten days ago, he discovered that he could no longer strengthen his mental cultivation by devouring the divine runes’ energy. The divine runes within the saint lotuses have significantly weakened, and they needed a long time to recover.

The Blue Dragon Bone produced the vitality that the saint lotuses devoured. So it wouldn’t cause any exhaustion. To replenish, he had to circulate the Blue Dragon Bone whenever his vitality fell below one-third.

Suddenly, Lin Yun opened his eyes with starlight shining within his pupils. As a terrifying aura rumbled around him, ten stars bloomed above the two saint runes within the profound palace. His mental cultivation has reached the tenth-stage Saint Spiritualist. Breathing out, Lin Yun felt energetic.

“Time to go out.” Lin Yun said. He should’ve left this place a long time ago because the improvement of his mental cultivation became slow ten days ago. But when he finished going through his tribulation, his cultivation reached the late phase of the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm before he could even stabilize his cultivation.

Over the past two months, he refined all the Divine Blood Fruit’s leaves. He used two saint leaves to reach the sixth pulse and four leaves to reach the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. With that, he had ultimately used up all the saint leaves, and only the Divine Blood Fruit remained. Lin Yun planned to use it when he reached the Samsara Edict Realm.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun recollected his vitality and left under the saint lotuses’ reluctance. Turning to the saint lotuses, Lin Yun smiled and cupped his hands together, “Thank you.”

The saint lotuses were the main reason he could reach the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm and tenth-stage Saint Spiritualist in two months, aside from the six saint leaves. The lotuses were made up of divine runes, and the divine runes’ energy was being emitted from them. This meant that there was practically no exhaustion for them.

Lin Yun absorbed the energy of the divine runes that filled this secret space, and the fog could no longer be seen.

With a thought, Lin Yun summoned the Flower Burial Sword from his interspatial bracelet. He couldn’t store it within the interspatial bracelet in the past. But after it was upgraded to a saint sword, this restriction was lifted.

“Flower Burial, it has been a long time.” Lin Yun smiled.

The sword vibrated in response, as though it was filled with grievances. Ever since the Ancient Barren Battlefield it had been close to half a year since Lin Yun last took it out.

“Haha, sorry about that.” Lin Yun smiled. He drew his sword and started practicing various sword techniques in this space, the Aquaheaven Sword Technique, Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, Carefree 9 Swords, and the Three Heavenly Rends. He even practiced the Overlord Sword that he hadn’t used in a while.

Lin Yun was excited to hold his sword again, mainly because he focused entirely on music dao during this period.

“Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon!” Lin Yun roared, circulating the sword sutra. When the heavenly dragon and divine phoenix appeared, the sword aura he gave off suddenly became majestic.

The heavenly dragon roared whenever he swung his sword, and the divine phoenix cried out. When a ten-foot sword ray exploded from his body, the massive golden sword ray gave off the feeling that it could even tear space apart with a swing.

“What power!” Lin Yun’s face was excited when he sensed the power of this sword ray. After the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon reached the sixth stage, the power underwent a drastic transformation. The more he thought about it, the more he felt the cauldron really needed a beating.

“Heavenly Dragon!” Lin Yun soared to the sky and swung his sword. As the heavenly dragon entered the sword, it unleashed a terrifying dragon’s aura, and the Flower Burial Sword manifested into a silver-grey sword ray of a few dozen feet. The surface of the sword ray was engraved in dragon runes with an ancient and overbearing aura.

When the sword ray flickered, the dragon’s roar echoed incessantly. When the heavenly dragon dissipated and the divine phoenix entered the Flower Burial Sword, the sword turned red, and it would unleash crimson flames whenever he swung it.

“Dragon-Phoenix!” Lin Yun spun in mid-air, raising the sword to the sky. When the crimson and silver-grey sword rays combined, the Flower Burial Sword released a sword ray that reached a hundred feet long.

At the tip of the sword ray, a thunderstorm raged before forming into a black vortex. At this moment, his azure dragon sword intent unleashed a devastating power under the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon.

The potential of his Azure Dragon Saint Physique was practically excavated after the heavenly dragon and divine phoenix combined.

“Is this the genuine Azure Dragon Undying Sword Intent?” Lin Yun was dazed while looking at the phenomenon he had created.

Meanwhile, two figures appeared outside the Golden Crow Altar. They were naturally Yue Weiwei and Mu Xueling.

“Where’s Big Brother Lin?” Yue Weiwei’s expression became weird when she couldn’t see Lin Yun anywhere.

But Mu Xueling’s gaze was glued to the Golden Crow Altar with shock. She couldn’t fathom how Lin Yun managed to enter the Nine Lotus Diagram, no matter how she racked her brain over it.
