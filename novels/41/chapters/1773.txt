Chapter 1774 – Fate Brings Us Together

The Radiant Snow Flowers shone within Ye Ziling’s pupils, and she even had a white dragon coiling around her.

“Radiant Snow Sword Net!” Ye Ziling dashed forth. A massive sword aura exploded from her as she unleashed countless sword rays. In just one breath, the White Dragon Saint Sword in her hand released over a hundred sword rays, and the purple lightning sword rays gradually merged with the surrounding snowflakes. As her sword rays intertwined, they formed a sword net of ice and lightning that enveloped Yuan Hao.

This made Yuan Hao furrow his brows, and he threw his punch forth. He unleashed a barrage of punches, and each punch was like an erupting volcano. His dragon origin reached a limit, but the snowflakes falling from the sky weakened his attacks. Thus, the remnant power of his punches only managed to break the edge of the sword net.

When the sword net descended, it quickly tangled around Yuan Hao, crushing the dragon origin around him. The net made Yuan Hao feel weak, and this made him nervous. He didn’t hesitate to unleash his full strength and brought out his nine dragon pulses, wanting to break free from the sword net. But he was horrified to discover that the sword net absorbed most of his dragon origin.

The sword net was like a saint artifact devouring his dragon origin, and the net was flickering with dark saint runes. At the same time, the sword net gradually dissolved into his body, and his dragon origin couldn’t put up any resistance against the process.

This thoroughly made Yuan Hao panic, worried that he would be defeated. When he fell into fear, Ye Ziling landed on the ground, swiftly turning around and pushing her palm forth.

As a bolt of lightning flew out from her palm, it instantly struck Yuan Hao.

The impact made Yuan Hao throw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent out of the Thunderblood Battlestage. The dragon origin enveloping him crumbled, and a bloody hole appeared on his chest with his blood pouring out.

When Ye Ziling spun, she waved her hand, and the white dragon flew back. When the white dragon returned to her hand, everyone noticed it was a sword, the White Dragon Saint Sword gifted to her by Lin Yun.

“Holy shit! What sword technique is that?” Everyone was shocked. They were shocked by how fast the battle ended and the speed of the last sword.

After defeating Yuan Hao, Ye Ziling faced two more geniuses from the holy lands. They weren’t any weaker than Yuan Hao; one was even ranked two hundred and thirty on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. But Ye Ziling ultimately persevered, winning all three battles. Following her victory, the name of the Sword Sect rose swiftly, and it soon became an existence that no one could overlook.

“Not bad. The current generation of the Sword Sect has grown up. Ye Ziling, let me face you!” A figure soared to the sky, another a disciple of the Ming Cult. He was ranked ninety-seventh on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, Sikong Yuan!

When Sikong Yuan landed on the stage, he unleashed his aura and attacked without holding back. With a wave of his hand, he summoned a longspear and thrust it forth.

His longspear was like a dragon that pierced through the space before him, breaking apart the snowflakes and sword aura that was in its path before reaching Ye Ziling. The battle had just begun, and Ye Ziling was already facing a dangerous situation. But she was calm as she retreated before swinging her sword.

With a retreat and advance simultaneously, a dragon roar echoed along Ye Ziling’s sword ray, easily dissolving Sikong Yuan’s attack.

“Not bad.” Sikong Yuan smirked, before he became serious.

“Take an attack for me as well!” After dissolving Sikong Yuan’s attack, Ye Ziling flicked her wrist and unleashed six sword rays.

The six sword rays turned into six white dragons that flew forth. Each of her swords would cause space to freeze. The speed of the six dragons reached a limit, pushing the Thunderfrost Intent to the limit. Lightning Intent represented speed, and Ice Intent could freeze everything, including sound.

“As expected of Jian Jingtian’s daughter. It looks like I can’t underestimate you…” Sikong Yuan smiled, taking several steps back. He was lucky to react so quickly because he would have six holes in his body if his reaction had been slightly slower.

“Soundless and shadowless sword?” Lin Yun was surprised because it looked like Ye Ziling received a lot of benefits from the saint origin. She could now exhibit the characteristics of her Thunderfrost Intent to the limit.

On the Thunderstorm Battlestage, they were both evenly matched. Even Sikong Yuan, ranked ninety-seventh, couldn’t obtain the upper hand against Ye Ziling and even showed trends of falling into a disadvantageous situation instead.

“Who is this Ye Ziling? She seems to be even stronger than Zhao Yan!”

“She can probably make it into the top hundredth with her strength. How unbelievable…”

“She seems to be Jian Jingtian’s daughter…” The discussions in the surroundings were ongoing, and everyone was amazed by Ye Ziling’s strength.

But Ye Ziling was utterly immersed in the fight and couldn’t pay any attention to the surrounding discussions. She was calmly analyzing how to resolve this battle quickly. Sikong Yuan was stronger than her, and her odds of winning were small if the fight continued. Sikong Yuan could also tell that, which was why he maintained the stalemate despite being in a disadvantageous position.

As determination flashed across her pupils, Ye Ziling knew it was time for her to do something about this fight, or she would lose if the fight dragged on.

“Divine Dragon Skylocking Sword!” As snowflakes fell, her long sleeves were like clouds as she soared into the sky. She was like a nimble purple thundercloud floating towards Sikong Yuan, with all her strength hidden in the clouds.

Shadowless, formless, soundless, and anatta.

This was the new anatta sword dao that Ye Ziling mastered. This was the ultimate move she, herself, created for her Thunderfrost Sword Dao, combining her comprehension of the saint origin. The profundity contained within this sword far surpassed any ghost spirit martial technique of the same grade.

Sikong Yuan furrowed his brows, feeling a little pressure. Holding onto the spear with both hands, he began to swiftly rotate it, with light screens appearing before him. The light curtains had a revolving sun and moon that resisted the sudden outburst of Ye Ziling’s sword aura.

“Break!” Ye Ziling couldn’t find the best opportunity to attack, but she could only unleash it before her sword aura declined. As the purple clouds broke apart, a white dragon roared and charged forth. When the white dragon appeared, an overwhelming sword aura fell onto Sikong Yuan like shackles.

In response to her attack, Sikong Yuan let out a roar, and his aura began to start rising. Shattering the incoming sword aura, he turned the spear a few hundred rounds before stabbing forth.

Ye Ziling threw out a mouthful of blood and flew backward when their attacks clashed. But Sikong Yuan wasn’t in a good state either because he was bleeding from his palm. This made his lips twitch and he grimaced from the pain.

Everyone at the Martial Dao Tea party was shocked, and they could tell how terrifying this sword from Ye Ziling was. If Zhao Yan relied on his talent and the sword technique left behind by Flower Burial to shine at the tea party, Ye Ziling found her own path. But anyone with a discerning eye could tell that this sword was still somewhat lacking; she was lacking in her cultivation. If Ye Ziling’s cultivation was the same as Sikong Yuan, the latter would lose.

The pain Sikong Yuan felt made him furious, and he pounced forth. He was a relatively petty person, and he didn’t want to let his opponent lose so easily.

When Ye Ziling landed on the ground, she saw a palm approaching her. This palm was swift, and she didn’t even have the time to admit defeat. When she was prepared to take this palm head-on, a figure suddenly descended with a palm resting on her shoulder.

Her body was pulled back, and that person stepped forth, taking the palm head-on. When the two palms collided, the person who appeared didn’t take a step back, but Sikong Yuan was sent flying away. When Sikong Yuan landed on the ground, his facial expression was terrifyingly dark.

This sudden change surprised many people, and they still hadn’t recovered. When they raised their heads, they saw someone wearing a bamboo hat standing before Ye Ziling.

“Who are you? And why are you interfering in my fight with her?” Sikong Yuan coldly questioned while suppressing his anger.

“Lady Ye has already lost, hasn’t she?” A voice came out from the bamboo hat.

When Ye Ziling came to her senses, she nodded and cupped her hands together, “I admit defeat. If there’s an opportunity in the future, I will seek guidance from Brother Sikong again.”

The corner of Sikong Yuan’s lip twitched, and he was upset. He might have won, but it was even more embarrassing than losing. This naturally filled his heart full of anger. But he could only bite the bullet and replied, “Thanks for the battle.”

As Ye Ziling nodded her head, she became puzzled when she turned to look at the person wearing a bamboo hat, wondering about his identity. But since this person wore a bamboo hat, this meant he didn’t want to reveal his identity, and she naturally wouldn’t ask about it. Thus, she merely cupped her hands together as a form of gratitude before leaving.

The person wearing a bamboo hat was naturally Lin Yun. He had been paying attention to everyone from the Sword Sect. He finally couldn't hold himself back when he saw Ye Ziling lose and was about to be further humiliated. No matter what, he couldn’t allow his senior brother’s daughter to suffer a loss here.

Just when Lin Yun was about to leave, Sikong Yuan stopped him. He yelled, “Stop! That was just a warm-up. Since you can take my palm head-on, I believe you’re not a nobody. So how about we finish the fight?”

His eyes were squinted as he looked at Lin Yun; he didn’t want to let the latter go just like that. His anger was pent up, and it would feel uncomfortable if he let Lin Yun go so easily.

“Haha. I’m a nobody on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. So I think it’s best to forget about me.” Lin Yun smiled beneath his bamboo hat, having no intention of fighting.

“It’s fate that brought us together, and I’m certain you’re not a nobody. So you don’t have to be humble.” Sikong Yuan smiled. He then appeared before Lin Yun with a flash.

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t trust Sikong Yuan’s character, and backed away, fearing that the latter might make a sudden move. So when Sikong Yuan landed on the ground, Lin Yun had already appeared a hundred steps away, and his speed shocked everyone. Even the eyes of the monstrous geniuses from the holy lands couldn’t help lighting up when they saw Lin Yun’s speed.

With a wave of his hand, Sikong Yuan summoned his spear to him, and he slammed it onto the ground, causing sparks to fly. Squinting his eyes, Sikong Yuan eerily smiled, “Come on. I’m even more curious about your identity now!”

He even unleashed the pressure of his cultivation at the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm to forcibly stop Lin Yun from leaving.

This made Lin Yun sigh because he knew he couldn’t leave now, even if he wanted to. He couldn’t avoid partaking in the Martial Dao Tea Party, even if he didn’t want to. Since that was the case, then he would just fight.

He raised his hand and removed the bamboo hat, revealing a face that everyone was familiar with. Everyone in the surroundings fell into a brief silence before they exclaimed because it was the first of the Nirvana Banquet, Lin Xiao.

Lin Xiao had just become first on the Nirvana Banquet. So who wouldn’t know about his name? But what was a musician doing at the Martial Dao Tea Party? Did he come to the wrong place?
