Chapter 1158 - Intoxicating Flute Music (2)

Ye Ziling tapped her foot on the ground and shuttled through the ruins. When she finally stopped, she waved her hand to get rid of some dust, revealing a buried jade flute.

“Found it!” Ye Ziling wore an innocent smile when she held onto the flute because she had seen Flower Burial using this sword to destroy Lei Ying’s attack in the final clash.

But at the same time, Flower Burial seemed to have suffered heavy injuries or else he wouldn’t have left without retrieving his flute. When she thought that Flower Burial could be heavily injured, the smile on her face disappeared. She started to look around with her brows locked together as there was a possibility that Flower Burial was recuperating nearby.

Right at this moment, Ye Ziling could sense the existence of a sword intent in the ruins that instantly made her eyes lit up. Without any hesitation, she began to head towards the origin of the sword intent.

When she found the sword intent, her eyes couldn’t help flashing with disappointment because it was just Lin Yun laying on the ground. His face was rosy, and he was currently struggling to open his eyes.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun opened his eyes before he looked around blankly.

He remembered that he was seriously injured and was on the brink of death. Furthermore, he lost consciousness before he could even take out a Nirvana Pellet. But when he opened his eyes again, his injuries had disappeared. In fact, his vitality was powerfully surging in his body, reaching a ridiculous height.

He could sense that his body had undergone a drastic transformation. Suddenly, the words ‘Azure Dragon Saint Physique’ appeared in his mind, which startled him because he couldn’t believe that he would achieve it with just some sleep. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You returned to save me, right?” A voice suddenly sounded out that made Lin Yun bounce back up. When he raised his head, he could only see a pair of long legs. When he continued to raise his head, he finally saw Ye Ziling’s familiar appearance.

“Your courage is worth praising, but you’re a little too weak. If it wasn’t for Flower Burial who showed up, we would be reduced to two corpses now,” said Ye Ziling.

Her words completely dumbfounded Lin Yun. Then, he saw the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute that Ye Ziling was holding. He realized that he had forgotten about the jade flute when he lost consciousness. But it was fortunate that Ye Ziling had retrieved it. A brief moment later, he realized that it was even more troublesome that it had fallen into Ye Ziling’s hands because he had no idea how he would retrieve it from her.

“Don’t feel too bad about it. A demonic cultivator like Lei Ying isn’t someone an ordinary cultivator in the Astral Stage can deal with. The fact that you managed to kill Luo Kui doesn’t mean that you’re able to fight true geniuses in the Astral Stage,” said Ye Ziling. “Furthermore, even an ordinary genius in the Astral Stage wouldn’t be able to interfere in the fight between Flower Burial and Lei Ying. You probably lost your consciousness from the shockwave of the fight. You’re fortunate that you’re okay.”

All Lin Yun could do was smile awkwardly. He knew that he couldn’t explain himself.

Fortunately, Ye Ziling wouldn’t suspect that he was Flower Burial. Lin Yun felt humiliated and relieved. As for the thought in Ye Ziling’s mind, he wasn’t bothered by them.

“What are you laughing at? Is the origin stone still around?” Ye Ziling asked, looking at Lin Yun.

“Of course.” Lin Yun winked before the smile on his face disappeared. He could tell that his sword box was a lot lighter than before. The origin stone wasn’t in the sword box.

“W-W-What’s going on?” Lin Yun took a deep breath because he couldn’t understand what was going on.

However, Ye Ziling was more composed than Lin Yun. “The origin stone of the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal has some intelligence, so it’s not surprising that it escaped while you were unconscious. But it’s impossible for us to find it now…”

Although Lin Yun had an idea of where it went, he didn’t dare to share it with Ye Ziling out of fear that she would kill him.

“Lady Ye, you saw Flower Burial?” Lin Yun changed the topic, trying to shift Ye Ziling’s attention.

Nodding her head, Ye Ziling replied, “The rumors are true that he’s a core disciple of our Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. He should also be from a saint clan like Luo Hua, who’s interested in the secrets of the Sword Saint Mountain and came to our Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun couldn’t help laughing inwardly when he heard that because he didn’t know that he came from a saint clan. It appeared that Ye Ziling had thought of an entire story on his behalf.

Suddenly, Lin Yun looked at Ye Ziling and asked, “Lady Ye, you reached the Astral Stage?”

“Yeah. He must’ve fed me a Nirvana Pellet. You might not have heard of it before, but the Nirvana Pellet can bring someone on the brink of death back to life. It can also help them gain comprehension through life and death…” Ye Ziling’s cold face flushed with embarrassment as she stopped speaking. After all, it was a secret that she shared with Flower Burial.

Flower Burial should only have one Nirvana Pellet, but he still gave it to her despite his injuries. If he was really a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, then he should have seen her before. It was strange that she had no idea who he was.

But when Lin Yun heard what Ye Ziling said, he couldn’t help smiling. How could he possibly not have heard of the Nirvana Pellet? After all, he was the one who fed it to her.

“Lady Ye, did he leave this jade flute behind?” Lin Yun looked at the jade flute that Ye Ziling was holding on to. He was wondering how he should retrieve it.

“Yeah. He was heavily injured and couldn’t retrieve the flute in time. I can tell that this isn’t an ordinary saint artifact!” Ye Ziling sighed with her brows locked as she looked at the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute.

“It’s called the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute,” said Lin Yun.

When Ye Ziling heard that, she raised his brow and asked, “You know about it?”

“I already told you that I also know how to play the flute,” smiled Lin Yun.

Hearing that, Ye Ziling remembered that Lin Yun did say that.

“We definitely have to give this Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute to Flower Burial, what do you think?” asked Lin Yun. After Ye Ziling nodded her head, he continued, “Since Lady Ye knows nothing about music dao, why don’t you leave it with me? If he’s really a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, he will definitely show himself to retrieve it if I play it in the sect.”

“What you said makes sense.” Ye Ziling couldn’t find a flaw in Lin Yun’s plan. Her heart even started to throb when she thought that Flower Burial might show himself in the sect.

But when she handed the flute over to Lin Yun, she had a feeling that something wasn’t right. Suddenly, she realized that if Flower Burial wasn’t a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, Lin Yun would continue to possess the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute.

“Sit down.” Lin Yun smiled, not giving Ye Ziling the chance to take back the flute. Then, he placed it by his lips.

Looking at Ye Ziling, who was seated in front of him, he turned his gaze to the blue sky and started playing.
