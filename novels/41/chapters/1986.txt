Chapter 1987 - Stop Pretending (2)

“You must’ve kept your distance from her because of Bai Shuying. But you don’t have to worry about that now that Bai Shuying is gone,” Wang Yue said.

Lin Yun maintained his silence. He was really speechless this time.

When Wang Yue saw that Ye Qingtian was silentl, his eyes lit up, and he smiled, “You don’t have to say anything, I know what you mean. I know that it’s inappropriate now, so I’ll take my leave first. I’ll look for you after some time.”

Before he left, Wang Yue gave Ye Qingtian a deep gaze as though he knew everything.

After Wang Yue left, Lin Yun muttered, “I thought I was an expert, but he’s the expert instead. He ‘knows’ everything aside from sword dao. I have no idea how he comprehended the Life Intent.”

Wang Yue was a good person and one of Lin Yun’s few friends within the Heavenly Dao Sect. Otherwise, he wouldn’t put up with someone who blabbered so much.

“Lin Yun, that lass lied. She’s still a virgin,” Lil’ Purple said.

“You’re also knowledgeable when it comes to this field?” Lin Yun asked.

Lil’ Purple’s face blushed, and she said, “Didn’t you forget that I’ve seen her entire body back in the Celestial Pool?”

“So this is only her excuse to cut clean with the Bai Clan. But I wonder who’s the person she’s waiting for…?” Lin Yun said after a brief pondering.

“You’re not afraid that she’ll go look for him?” Lil’ Purple asked.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he replied, “What does it have to do with me? I should leave the sect as well. I have to make a trip to the Myriad Grave Valley.”

“Are you really thinking about grasping nirvana intent? It’s not that easy. Let’s not mention that you haven’t grasp the life and death intents; it’s not easy to comprehend nirvana intent, even if you did possess them. If you're not careful, you might spend from a decade to a century trying to comprehend it.” Lil’ Purple said because she knew how tough it was to grasp nirvana intent.

As the saying goes, time was the monarch, and space was king. But when nirvana appears, they’re both nothing. It might sound unbelievable, but it wasn’t a lie because it was rumored since ancient times.

“The Iris Sword Saint can do it, so why can’t I?” Lin Yun refuted.

“He’s different,” Lil’ Purple said.

“I have already looked into the Myriad Graves Valley. That place is filled with graves, blood crows, and bizarre flowers. Even if I can’t find any clues about Life Intent, I can upgrade the Flower Burial Sword. So consider it as killing two birds with one stone.”

Over at Indigo Thunder Peak, sword rays flickered, accompanied by occasional dragon roars in a certain courtyard. When the sword rays flashed, thunderstorms raged. Lin Yun was practicing his sword in his courtyard.

After fighting with Bai Shuying three days ago, Lin Yun would try to fuse his sword and Azure Dragon Intents, as well as practicing the Wither Sword Art. He had a lot of insights into his battle with Bai Shuying, who merged her Fire, Ice, and Sword Intents.

Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Intent wasn’t any weaker than the Ice-Fire Intent and was even stronger in a certain sense. But he neglected the Azure Dragon Intent. He might fuse them occasionally on a whim, but it was lacking compared to Bai Shuying’s Ice-Fire Intent, which mimicked the sun and moon.

Lin Yun had some clues about fusing them over the past three days, but he still couldn’t find the key, which made him a little irritable. Even the Wither Sword Art was tossed to the side.

I possess dual sword souls, and my senior brothers praised me. So I shouldn’t be inferior to Bai Shuying. Lin Yun was inwardly baffled.

Strictly speaking, Bai Shuying couldn’t be considered a pure swordsman. She practiced her martial intents differently from others and cultivated the perception that she was above them. She must be following some kind of ancient path, and she was really mysterious. Even Lil’ Purple couldn’t see through her entirely.

While Lin Yun was pondering, a figure approached during the night. She was surrounded by a thin cloth, giving off a profound radiance, and had a voluptuous figure.

Senior Sister? Lin Yun was surprised to see this person, and he cupped his fists together, “I pay my greetings to the Profound Maiden.”

Xin Yan hovered in the air and looked at Ye Qingtian curiously. After all, Ye Qingtian stood out in the exchange three days ago and defeated Nie Wushuang with music before crippling Ye Qinghong of the Ye Clan. So no one didn’t know about him within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and even the Eastern Desolation knew that there was someone like him.

Then again, what made Xin Yan really curious were the rumors that Ye Qingtian confessed to Bai Shuying, forcing the latter to reveal her cultivation at the Quasi-Saint Realm and leaving the sect. He rose to fame because of that, but his reputation was mixed.

Initially, someone like Ye Qingtian wouldn’t catch Xin Yan’s attention, and she would maintain her distance from him. But for some reason, she couldn’t help feeling a close connection with this person, and she didn’t feel any disgust upon meeting him. She even felt that Ye Qingtian seemed to be on guard against her, and this guard was deliberate and reserved.

“Ye Qingtian, you’ve caused quite the commotion in just half a month,” Xin Yan smiled.

“Profound Maiden, you must be joking,” Lin Yun replied carefully.

Xin Yan couldn’t help laughing when she saw Ye Qingtian’s expression and even wondered if it was her misperception. Ye Qingtian was a little too serious in front of her, and he was nothing like the rumors. She didn’t ask too much about it and said, “My master wishes to see you.”

“Please lead the way, Profound Maiden,” Lin Yun said, cupping his fists together.

Half a stick of incense later, Lin Yun finally met the legendary Serene Dust Great Saint. When the Serene Dust Great Saint saw him, she got Xin Yan to leave before she examined him with a smile. The Serene Dust Great Saint was famous for being overprotective within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and her enemies tended to end up miserable.

After all, a Saint Sovereign was forced into a tough position because Zhang Yue was hung outside the Profound Maiden Courtyard.

Lin Yun took a deep breath before he cupped his fists together, “Disciple Lin Yun, greets Mistress.”

“‘Mistress’?” The Serene Dust Great Saint was briefly stunned before she wore a playful smile, “If your master knew what you called me, he’d probably expel you. Don’t address me in this manner in the future.”

“Okay, Mistress,” Lin Yun nodded.

The Serene Dust Great Saint’s face sank, and she coldly said, “I have already joined Buddhism, and I’ll break your legs if you address me that way again. I’ll make you speak, kneeling.”

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled, “Okay, Mistress.”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The Serene Dust Great Saint snorted before she pointed for Lin Yun to sit down. She said, “You’ve caused quite the commotion recently. Even the Bai Clan and Ye Clan were fuming. I pondered and decided to keep you here…”

After she said that, she suddenly thought of something and looked at Lin Yun’s smile. This instantly made her awkward, but she was a Great Saint. She smiled, “If Wuming were as smart as you back then, I wouldn’t have joined Buddhism. If I heard you calling me ‘Mistress’ a few hundred years ago, I would probably rejoice. I’ve become old now. You dare to call me ‘Mistress,’ but I don’t dare to acknowledge it.”

The Serene Dust Great Saint’s voice sounded a little sad and heart-aching. Lin Yun quickly said, “Mistress, you must be joking. Mistress is still beautiful, and many women within the Heavenly Dao Sect can barely hold a cradle to your beauty.”

He wasn’t lying because the Serene Dust Great Saint’s beauty wasn’t inferior to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. They both had their traits, and they were both rare beauties.

The Serene Dust Great Saint smiled, “Even Wuming never praised me like that. Alright, let’s stop joking around. You’ll stay here for the next few days, and no one will dare to make trouble with you here.”
