Chapter 1342 - Beat That Baldie To Death!

Deep in the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda, Lin Yun had already collected ten saint elixirs. Just as Lil’ Purple had said, the fengshui on this mountain was different, and there were many saint elixirs here.

The other Greater Elysium Core Realm experts might have been dealt with by him, but there were still demonic beasts guarding the saint elixirs. Then again, the process wasn’t exactly smooth, either. Those demonic beasts were terrifying, and there were some saint elixirs that not even Lin Yun dared to collect.

“Ten saint elixirs, that should be enough,” muttered Lin Yun. It felt great to occupy the entire mountain. At the very least, there was no one bothering him.

“Ten saint elixirs are enough for you to make a breakthrough?” Lil’ Purple was surprised. Although the saint elixirs in the pagoda were quickly formed and couldn’t be compared to those found outside, they were still genuine saint elixirs. If it was just for Lin Yun to make a breakthrough, then it should be more than enough.

“It’s definitely enough if I’m only going to make a breakthrough. But I want to refine an origin saint rune while I make a breakthrough or there won’t be any meaning. But I have a Dragon Origin Pellet. If that’s not enough, I can also use the divine leaf of the Divine Blood Fruit, so I don’t have to worry that the saint elixirs aren’t enough,” said Lin Yun. After all, engraving an origin saint rune on his elysium core was a symbol for fated transcendents. If he didn’t have one, then the gap between him and the fated transcendents would become even wider.

“Origin saint runes aren’t things you can find anywhere, and they’re harder to find than saint elixirs,” said Lil’ Purple with a grave expression.

But Lin Yun didn’t say a word. He had a feeling that there must be some other treasures where the Great Saint Origin was located. Even if he couldn’t find any origin saint runes, who knows if there might be an alternative.

“Lin Yun, where’s the Profound Wither Key? Why aren’t you taking it out? Without the Profound Wither Key, it’s practically impossible for you to find the Great Saint Origin here,” said Lil’ Purple with her brows locked together.

Lin Yun took out the Profound Wither Key and said, “I’ve already taken it out a long time ago, but it doesn’t have any reaction. If it wasn’t for the reaction it showed some time ago, I’d be suspecting if it’s real.”

“Let me take a look.” Lil’ Purple waved her hand and received the Profound Wither Key.

“There’s a restriction!” Lil’ Purple was surprised before she said, “Let me give it a try and see if I can undo the restriction.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because he should’ve long guessed that. The gold and crimson divine runes on Lil’ Purple’s forehead shone before they flew from her forehead. When the two divine runes landed on the Profound Wither Key, a loud sound echoed and the mountain Lin Yun was standing on began to tremble.

Shortly after, fine golden lights began to fall off the Profound Wither Key like snow. Looking at it again, it looked as though it had been washed. When the golden light fell off the key, it revealed a golden key.

“Alright, it’s done.” Lil’ Purple gasped for breath with beads of sweat on her forehead.

“Okay, wipe your sweat and rest a little.” Lin Yun handed her a napkin and took the Profound Wither Key. But the moment he held onto the key, his face changed because the key had become a lot heavier and ancient golden runes were engraved on the surface.

At this moment, Lin Yun even suspected that he could kill a Greater Elysium Core Realm by throwing it out. But when Lin Yun looked at it more carefully, he said, “Wait, there seem to be a few more layers of seals.”

“Yeah. There’s a total of nine seals, and I only restored its original appearance. This key has a huge origin, and it might be related to the Southern Emperor’s tomb,” said Lil’ Purple while she wiped the sweat on her forehead. At the same time, Lin Yun was shocked that there were actually nine seals on such a small key. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Try it again. Don’t use your astral energy, but use your firmament sword intent, instead,” said Lil’ Purple. This time, she was pretty confident in her tone.

When Lin Yun poured his firmament sword intent into the key, a faint light appeared on the key before it began to tremble towards a certain direction. Holding onto the key, Lin Yun could sense a majestic existence made of light that appeared in his mind and enveloped him in it. Before it, his firmament sword intent seemed tiny in comparison.

Loosening his grip on the key, Lin Yun said, “I seem to have sensed the existence of the Great Saint Origin earlier. It’s in a special location, but I should be able to find it with the key.”

“Then, what are you waiting for?” Lil’ Purple yelled.

Turning to look at Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun said, “No need to hurry. Let’s wait for the others.”

The Great Saint Origin was a huge opportunity that others wouldn’t be able to come in contact with. Even if they couldn’t obtain the Great Saint Origin, there might be other opportunities around. So Lin Yun wanted to take care of them a little before he left the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

He naturally wouldn’t go against his words, so he didn’t bother about Lil’ Purple. An hour later, the others from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect arrived under Lil’ Red’s lead. They were emotional when they saw Lin Yun, especially Jiang Lichen. In the past, he had some negative feelings about Lin Yun, and he initially thought that he would soon be able to catch up to Lin Yun after entering the pagoda. But he never expected that Lin Yun would really wait for them.

“Junior Brother Lin, sorry to hold you down.” Jiang Lichen said in a guilty tone. After all, Lin Yun had given up on the opportunities in the pagoda, and this was a great loss.

“I’m still alright,” smiled Lin Yun. “I was pretty lucky and collected ten saint elixirs, so it’s not exactly a loss.”

“What?” Jiang Lichen’s mouth was wide open and he couldn’t utter a word anymore. When the rest heard what Lin Yun said, their eyes also lit up because it was the saint elixirs that they were talking about, and saint elixirs were rare, even in the pagoda.

“The other saint elixirs were guarded by powerful demonic beasts. They’re at the Heavenly Elysium Core realm or even the Dragon Pulse Realm, so let’s not provoke them.” Lin Yun held onto the Profound Wither Key and said, “Follow me, I’ll bring you guys to a place.”

When Su Ziyao heard that, she smiled because she already knew where Lin Yun was taking them.

“Where?” Jiang Lichen asked curiously.

“You’ll know after we arrive.” Lin Yun didn’t explain much and headed in the direction that the Profound Wither Key was leading him. In the pagoda, there were many deadly traps like the blood pool, and one would die if they weren’t careful. But with the Profound Wither Key’s protection, Lin Yun’s entire journey was smooth.

Just when they were halfway to the Great Saint Origin, Lin Yun suddenly stopped and he could see a golden figure fleeing for his life, and his shiny skinhead was striking. That person seemed to be fleeing from a mountain, and there was multiple terrifying auras chasing after him. Many of them were familiar. They were Nangong Ze, Ning Feng, Zhang Jin, Tang Jing, and Luo Shuyi.

“That baldie seems to be Cang Yun from the Vajra Monastery,” said Ye Ziling.

Cang Yun was fast, and it didn’t take long for him to be before them. But just when they were about to clash, Cang Yun stomped his foot on the ground and flew to the sky, bypassing them.

This left everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect shocked, including Lin Yun. At the very least, this monk was pretty impressive, since he could outrun the pursuit of several fated transcendents. If he wasn’t wrong, he could see that the monk was injured, and his current state was terrible.

“Are we going to give chase? He seems to have obtained a powerful treasure to suffer the pursuit of several fated transcendents,” said Ye Ziling.

“No need to care about him,” said Lin Yun.

If it was normal times, Lin Yun might consider joining the pursuit. But he had to look for the Great Saint Origin right now, so he didn’t want to cause any trouble. It would be best if the Profound Sky Sect was also involved with them so they wouldn’t bother him as he looked for the Great Saint Origin.

But just when he was done speaking, Cang Yun landed before them, looking at Ye Ziling and Su Ziyao with his eyes lighting up. “Flower Burial, you have a pretty good fortune with girls, and not a single one of those fated transcendents can be compared to you.”

Lin Yun was surprised when he heard that because Cang Yun seemed to be a lot different from what he had imagined. This also made Jiang Lichen and the rest feel weird because this monk was already going to die, and yet he still had no regard for his life since he had returned when he had already fled.

Cang Yun then turned to look at Lin Yun. “Flower Burial, you’ll be killed by Cang Yun sooner or later. So why don’t you give these two beauties to me? I can renounce being a monk, and it’ll be terrible for such beauties to be widows.”

Lin Yun’s lip twitched when he heard that. Cang Yun was simply asking for a beating. At this moment, he even suspected that Cang Yun’s mouth was the reason why Nangong Ze and the rest were chasing after him.

“I got a huge treasure this time, and the two of you won’t suffer a loss following me. So the two of you can consider it,” said Cang Yun with a smile.

“What treasure?” Su Ziyao asked.

Cang Yun briefly hesitated before he smiled. “It’s fine letting you guys take a look. This might be the best treasure, secondary to the Great Saint Origin.”

But when Cang Yun revealed the stone tablet, the eyes of Lin Yun, Ye Ziling, and Su Ziyao shone. Then again, Cang Yun was quick to hide the stone tablet again and smiled. “Alright, you had a look. So I’ll be taking my leave now. Bye~ Remember to look for me, beauties!”

He might be a little reckless, but he was still a cautious person and decided to flee when the fated transcendents were about to catch up. But just when he was about to leave, he instantly noticed that the eyes of Lin Yun, Su Ziyao, and Ye Ziling had changed.

Ye Ziling and Su Ziyao spread out and blocked off Cang Yun’s path of escape.

“Holy shit! Lin Yun, beat that baldie to death! Don’t let him escape! That’s a Golden Crow Divine Bone, so it might contain an origin divine rune!” Lil’ Purple voice anxiously resounded from the sword box.
