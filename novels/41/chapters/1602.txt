Chapter 1603 - Empty-Handed

When the demonic scorpions were about to get close, Lin Yun executed his movement technique and rained down his punches on the shells of the demonic scorpions. When he threw his punches out, he used his full strength in this attack, pouring thirty-thousand dragon runes into it.

Matched with his dragon origin ocean that reached nearly a hundred thousand feet, each of his punches was accompanied by a terrifying thunderstorm, and his fists were like dragon claws. In that split second, Lin Yun had sent the demonic scorpions flying before they could even get close to him.

But weirdly enough, the shell of the demonic scorpions was comparable to iron. Not only were there no traces left behind, but the rebound force hurt Lin Yun’s hands.

“How tough!” Lin Yun was surprised. The defenses of the demonic scorpions’ shells weren’t at all inferior to the infant Heavenly Profound Tortoise.

This was why those people were so easily killed. Their attacks couldn’t deal any damage to the demonic scorpions. After Lin Yun sent the demonic scorpions flying, they soon returned. They had a fast speed, and their pincers were like scissors that could tear space apart. But it was ultimately too slow.

Lin Yun didn’t even need to take any special precautions and relied on his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, which had a keen sense of danger to react. Despite being besieged by the ten-odd demonic scorpions, they couldn’t even touch the corner of his clothes.

In the fight, Lin Yun became increasingly proficient in the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent’s instincts, and he could even retaliate beforehand. Lin Yun forcibly controlled himself when he wanted to duck to the right by instinct, executing the Divine Sunchasing Art to throw a punch out.

The demonic scorpions were a little stumped. But before they could unleash their attacks, they took a blow to their heads. This made their heads cave in, with fine cracks spreading throughout their bodies, and their tough shells suddenly became fragile.

“Looks a little weak…” Lin Yun smiled. He now knew how to deal with them. Since he suddenly became serious, his hands joined together, and a seven-colored light bloomed with a dragon-shaped mark appearing.

With the Sovereign Dragon Seal empowering his attack, Lin Yun shuttled back and forth, unleashing countless attacks. As the demonic scorpions fell from the sky, it didn’t take long for there to be only one demonic scorpion left.

Executing his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, a hole appeared in the black sky as a boundless sword aura soared to the sky.

When the black sky was torn apart, it didn’t take long for the black clouds in the sky to be torn into pieces by this sword intent. As Lin Yun charged forth, he didn’t aim at the demonic scorpion’s weakness but at its shell. His Heavenly Dome Sword Intent penetrated the demonic scorpion’s shell, and a hundred sword rays shot out, piercing the demonic scorpion. It didn’t take long for the demonic scorpion’s tough shell to be reduced to smithereens.

“Stow!” Lin Yun retracted his sword intent back into his body. The black clouds swiftly closed up and returned to before.

“The Heavenly Dome Sword Intent can really destroy the shell.” Lin Yun muttered, but the commotion caused by his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent was a little too striking. This was still because he held back. If he went at full force, the phenomenon caused by his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent would only become even more terrifying, and his sword intent would manifest into the sky.

Furthermore, he could sense that the keen sense from his sword intent still had room for improvement. After comprehending the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, he should’ve visited his master because he still had much more to learn.

“Let’s get familiar with each other first. I wonder how the others are right now.” Lin Yun took out his Sword Sect’s medal and injected his dragon origin into it, but he couldn’t sense any of the Sword Sect’s disciples around.

When he traveled by himself at the boundary of the Ancient Barren Battlefield, his movement speed wasn’t fast, and he could tell that this place was weird. There was no sign of life on this land, but he could sense the dense spiritual energy in the atmosphere. It was so much so that the density of spiritual energy even formed into a light pillar phenomenon.

He could even see some mysterious palaces at the far end of his sight. The palaces were gorgeous, and looked like someone was still living in them.

Lin Yun had a firm heart, so he wouldn’t step into those palaces without confirming that they were real. He felt that there was a high possibility that those palaces were illusions and he would be in danger if he stepped in.

While walking around without aim on the barren land, Lin Yun could occasionally smell a dense stench of blood. Many corpses were on the ground, proving that someone was once there. But Lin Yun discovered that most of the demonic beasts weren’t as strong as the demonic scorpions he had faced earlier.

The demonic scorpions could be considered a special exemption. Facing the other demonic beasts, it wasn’t a problem for them to escape, even if they couldn’t defeat those demonic beasts. One could only say that the people who entered with Lin Yun were too unlucky.

The deeper he went into the Ancient Barren Battlefield, the surrounding spiritual energy gradually became denser, and he could occasionally see people fighting for saint elixirs. But Lin Yun was calm because he was already used to it.

Saint elixirs were precious, but ordinary saint elixirs couldn’t enter his eyes. To attract his attention, they had to be ten thousand-year saint elixirs, at the very least. His greatest hope was to find some ruins, to retrieve the incomplete ancient records, secret techniques, and ancient saint elixirs.

If he could find a complete saint palace, there was a high possibility that he could obtain saint elixirs or even the Dragon Gate’s inheritance. But the utmost importance right now was to find enough resources to reach the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to confront the other sect’s top-tiered geniuses.

Simultaneously, three people descended from another boundary of the Ancient Barren Battlefield, with several hundred people behind them. They all wore a unified uniform, and they were emitting a terrifying aura. The weakest among them was at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and many were at the pinnacle third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

The leaders of this party were even more unfathomable. They were the top three in the Profound Sky Sect. When Yan Kong spread his hands apart and revealed a black rock, he smiled, “This Origin Magnet Stone refined by Master is really useful, preventing us from being separated.”

When the other disciples opened their palms, every last one of them was holding onto an Origin Magnet Stone.

“Liu Xu, you bring a group of people to search for ancient records and saint elixirs. Kill anyone who dares to stand in your way!” Qin Tian said.

“Roger that, Master.” Liu Xu nodded.

“Yan Kong!”

“I’m here!”

“Gather the other sects’ disciples to search for the Sword Sect’s location and get rid of them the moment they gather together.” Qin Tian continued to give out instructions.

“Roger that!” Yan Kong smiled sinisterly and continued, “I love this task. I already wanted to teach them a lesson outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield. They’re all arrogant, and they’re really forgetful.”

The peace in the Ancient Barren Battlefield had been utterly disrupted. In just a day, nearly two hundred thousand people came in, and the slaughter had never stopped. Demonic beasts killed some, but more were killed by their own kind.

A massacre would be unavoidable whenever a treasure was found in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Many people lost their lives before they reached the depths of the Ancient Barren Battlefield. There were no rules on this battlefield, and anyone could be killed if they weren’t from the same sect as you. This was completely different from the usual competitions between sects in the outside world.

Ten days later, Lin Yun finally left the boundary of the Ancient Barren Battlefield. His fortune was a little terrible. He ran into a group of Bloodlusty Demonic Wasps just when he was about to walk out of the Ancient Barren Battlefield’s boundary.

There were many of them, and he couldn’t face them head-on. The wasp king was extremely cunning and equivalent to a fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Even if he released his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, he couldn’t do anything to the wasp king hidden deep in the flock of wasps.

The other Bloodlusty Demonic Wasps weren’t afraid of death. Even if Lin Yun chose to run, they pursued him for seven whole days before he finally managed to shake them off.

“My luck is too bad.” Lin Yun shook his head and continued forth.

After leaving the boundary of the Ancient Barren Battlefield, the entire region was enveloped in an aurora light, and had a high density of spiritual energy. While saint elixirs were occasionally born, various phenomena would descend.

Passing through the boundary could be considered an end to his suffering. The death of many experts also gave birth to many treasured places created by their blood. Many people took this opportunity to undergo their tribulations and make a breakthrough. In just this short period, second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses could no longer be seen because all the geniuses were at least at the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and there were still some who managed to reach the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

But most people died a terrible death because the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm’s tribulation was more terrifying than the first two, and it could be futile even with the help of saint elixirs. But a few people succeeded, and those people had incredible talent. So it could be considered a total transformation for them after reaching the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

When Lin Yun left the boundary, his cultivation in the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm instantly became striking, and his face became grave after hearing some information. He knew he had to swiftly reach the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

But because he spent too much time, the gap between him and the top-tiered Golden Generation geniuses widened. While Lin Yun walked around, he occasionally activated his Divine Dragon Eyes to push his vision to the limit. But he couldn’t obtain any harvest and could only take it one step at a time.

There were many places where powerful spiritual energy lingered, including corpses. But the moment saint elixirs were born, they were swiftly plucked.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

For seven days, Lin Yun had no harvest and could only smell the fragrance of saint elixirs. This was a terrible feeling, and even the usually calm Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling anxious.

This day, Lin Yun’s sword box suddenly trembled, and he came to a stop. Light shone in his pupils, and he swiftly activated the Divine Dragon Eyes, “A bizarre flower is born?”

At the far end of his vision, he could see an explosion of an aurora holy light covering the sky. This surprised Lin Yun because he had never seen such a shocking phenomenon. He didn’t hesitate to execute the Divine Sunchasing Art and rushed over, “This commotion is a little too big…”

He didn’t want to miss this, or he would throw out a mouthful of blood from the depression.
