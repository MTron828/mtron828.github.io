Chapter 1813 - Greater Mastery in Heavenly Dome Sword Intent! (2)

The Flower Burial Sword didn’t weaken even after traveling ten miles away from Lin Yun. Scenes began to appear within Lin Yun’s mind. They were the sceneries ‘seen’ by the Flower Burial Sword. Seventy miles later, the Flower Burial Sword stopped, and this brought joy to Lin Yun’s face because the range had expanded by sevenfold.

“How did Senior Brother manipulate his sword from ten thousand miles away?” Lin Yun still remembered that day when he was pursued by the Demon Domain after playing the flute to kill his target, his brother manipulated a sword that flew all the way over from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and helped him clean up his mess.

This meant Jian Jingtian’s sword intent far surpassed his imagination. Jian Jingtian’s cultivation might not have increased over the eighteen years he had imprisoned himself in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but his sword intent had been improving.

“Sixth grade? Or seventh grade?” Lin Yun muttered to himself. Jian Jingtian’s sword intent shouldn’t be at the seventh grade because the sect master, Mu Xuankong, was only at the seventh grade. Then again, perhaps it wasn’t as unbelievable as Lin Yun had thought.

The Flower Burial Sword could still barely fly after traveling seventy miles, it’s just that it was a lot slower and weaker. There was a risk of the Flower Burial Sword being interrupted and seized from him. Or perhaps his senior brother took the risk and manipulated his sword to extend the distance just to save him?

“Come back!” Lin Yun waved his hand, and the Flower Burial Sword returned to him. When it flew back to him, his sword wandered like a dragon around him.

The higher his cultivation, the stronger he felt how strong his senior brother was. It was no wonder why everyone said Jian Jingtian was the hope of bringing a Sword Sect back to a holy land.

Lin Yun suddenly reached out, and the Flower Burial Sword jumped around.

“Have you also become playful?” Lin Yun smiled. The Flower Burial Sword reacted as if it had heard him and slightly vibrated. It emitted a faint blue light as if it was responding to him.

Lin Yun reached out three times before he finally grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword. When he held onto the sword, his body trembled with his body filled with horrifying sword intent. As his hair began to flutter, he radiated an immense power that could even cause space to shatter with a simple gaze.

As the Flower Burial Sword trembled, the Glorymetal Spirit was like an abyss emitting a piercing aura.

“If I activate the glory spirit now, it should be able to tear apart some defensive Glory Saint Artifacts.” Lin Yun muttered. He could sense that the Flower Burial Sword’s edge had become sharper after his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent reached greater mastery.

He also wouldn’t have to exhaust that much dragon origin if he activated the Glorymetal Spirit. When he previously activated it, it would exhaust at least a quarter of his dragon origin, and he couldn’t even unleash one-hundredth of the Glory Saint Artifact’s power.

When Lin Yun poured his sword intent into the Glorymetal Spirit, his vision suddenly opened up, and he found himself in a vast starry sky. In this starry sky, there was a star cluster shining brightly.

There were seven stars shining brightly. The Glorymetal Spirit consisted of seven stars. The surface of each star was engraved with tens of thousands of saint runes. It was no wonder why it felt so exhausting to activate the Glorymetal Spirit. After all, this meant he had to activate all the saint runes on those seven stars, and just looking at the sheer number alone could make his scalp go numb.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I probably didn’t even light up a star in the past…” Lin Yun muttered to himself, and finally knew why all saints would go crazy over a Glory Saint Artifact.

Even experts at the Profound Life Stage couldn’t fully unleash the power of a Glory Saint Artifact, and those at the Dragon Pulse Realm could barely use it. When Lin Yun looked around this space, he noticed there were some blurred stars in the surroundings, but they were all dull.

He tried to extend his sword intent over, but failed, no matter how much he tried. These should be the glory spirits still hidden within the Flower Burial Sword. If he wanted to continue upgrading the sword, he would have to light those glory spirits sooner or later. He couldn’t imagine how powerful it would look if he lit up all the glory spirits, and he was filled with anticipation for it. But that was still too far away for him.

Lin Yun pondered that he could only light up a star of the Glorymetal Spirit cluster. But if he gave it his all, regardless of the price, he might be able to light it entirely.

He immediately gave it an attempt when he thought about it. When his sword intent retreated from the Flower Burial Sword, the dragon origin within his violet palace rumbled.

When his dragon origin started pouring into the Glorymetal Spirit, the saint runes on a star began to shine, and that was after exhausting one-tenth of his dragon origin.

The surface of the Flower Burial Sword began to shine with sword rays, and the Glorymetal Spirit emitted a dazzlingly chilling light. This was already his limit.

But Lin Yun knew that he only lit up a small portion of this star, and he had yet to reach his limit. After exhausting one-third of his dragon origin, the star finally lit up. The Flower Burial Sword radiated with great power within his hand, and it began to struggle against him.

As waves of terrifying power spread out while the Flower Burial Sword vibrated, the surrounding space began to shatter. The power contained within the sword had reached a limit and he had to unleash it.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun swung his sword. A sword ray that spread over a few hundred miles appeared, and it looked as though the sky was split into two from afar.

When the sword ray landed on the sea, it was split into two, and the crack reached three feet in length. The depth of this ravine was terrifying, reaching a few thousand meters deep before he could finally see the huge gulf.

Seeing this scene, Lin Yun couldn’t help shuddering. In the next moment, the ravine within the sea closed up, and the huge impact spread shockwaves to the sky. When the shockwaves swept over, Lin Yun couldn’t help trembling because of them, with this entire region quaking.

When the ravine completely closed up, a massive vortex appeared before a water pillar of a few thousand feet soared to the sky. This scene even shocked Lin Yun because he had just activated a star. This meant he only unleashed one-seventh of the Glorymetal Spirit, and he couldn’t imagine how terrifying it would be when he activated all seven stars.

For the first time, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling weird when he looked at the Flower Burial Sword in his hand. The sword ray shining from the Flower Burial Sword had dimmed by a lot, but it was pretty proud of what it did. Because of Lin Yun’s strong connection with his sword, he could sense the pride the sword gave off. It was like a child showing off its accomplishments, and this brought a smile to Lin Yun’s face. He knew that he had let it down in the past.

“Alright. I’m the one at fault for not being able to break apart the Myriad Scales Armor, and it’s not your fault.” Lin Yun knew what the Flower Burial Sword was thinking, and he comforted it.

Only then, the Flower Burial Sword was satisfied. This made Lin Yun smile before he sheathed his sword and landed on the sea like a drifting leaf.

The power of the sword intent was still around. Just the lingering energy was enough to make anyone terrified.

Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to leave, so he decided to take a brief rest. Although he failed to merge the Azure Dragon Saint Physique and Blue Dragon Saint Physique after tempering his physique in the lightning pool for seven days, it gave him a lot of insights.

He could now use the Sovereign Dragon Seal to forcibly merge his two saint physiques for a brief moment. During that time, he could come in contact with the threshold of the Divine Azure Dragon Physique as long as the Sovereign Dragon Seal existed.

There were many disadvantages to this method, and this was only a small trick. But since he could allow his strength to undergo a great boost for a brief moment, it was definitely worth a try.
