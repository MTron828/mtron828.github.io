Chapter 2300 - Karma

When Lin Yun had just arrived in the Great Qin Empire, Li Wuyou was the first person he met, and they soon became brothers. In the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s forbidden ground, they experienced life and death together, fighting the Wang Clan.

Lin Yun didn’t know that Li Wuyou came from the Kunlun Realm and was here for a droplet of the Vermilion Bird’s divine blood. But Li Wuyou remembered him and left behind a letter before he left.

“Holy shit, aren’t you a little too calm?” Mei Zihua exclaimed when he saw Li Wuyou’s calmness. He emotionally said, “A twenty-seven-year-old Sword Saint!”

Li Wuyou smiled, “What’s there to be emotional about?”

Mei Zihua sat down and poured a cup of tea for himself. He smiled, “The entire Divine Dragon Empire is shocked, so what do you think? I bet no one from your Li Clan can compete with him. Only those in their fifties might be able to compete with him.”

The Li Clan had an extraordinary position within the Divine Dragon Empire. The Divine Dragon Empire’s royal clan possessed the Dragon Clan’s bloodline. But the Li Clan possessed the Vermilion Bird’s bloodline. So, in terms of nobility, they weren’t inferior to the royal clan.

Li Wuyou calmly smiled, “I’m saying it’s nothing for my big brother.”

“Well, that makes sense. He’s the Champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path,” Mei Zihua replied.

Li Wuyou looked at him, and said, “Even if he’s not the Champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, I believe that my big brother will have an accomplishment.”

On the test in the Sword Firmament Pavilion, Lin Yun killed the Wang Clan’s descendant before so many experts from the sect. Since then, Li Wuyou was sure Lin Yun would walk out of the Profound Amber Realm.

Mei Zihua sighed, “I didn’t believe it when you told me before. How could a genius from a lesser realm possibly be the big brother of the Li Clan’s young master?”

“Then?” Li Wuyou smiled.

“Then…” Mei Zihua helplessly smiled. “I was taught a lesson by him during the Nirvana Banquet and was subdued by him in the Black Tortoise Void Sea. It’s not surprising for the older generations to step into the Saint Realm with the huge change, but someone who’s twenty-seven to grasp the Divine Light Sword Intent is unbelievable. I bet even Yu Qingfeng couldn’t do any better at that age.”

Li Wuyou smiled, but his facial expression became grave, “I was initially planning to pay the Vermilion Realm a visit when my big brother arrives, but it looks like I can’t wait now.”

“Yeah. He has risen and will be a prick in Tian Xuanzi’s eyes. There will be trouble during the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation,” Mei Zihua said.

“Make a trip with me,” Li Wuyou said.

Mei Zihua awkwardly smiled, and said, “Don’t tell me you don’t know who’s behind Tian Xuanzi. The Mei Clan is a musical clan, unlike your Vermilion Bird Clan. So why would we dare to offend the Profound Imperial Palace?”

Li Wuyou smiled, “You don’t have a choice. After all, rumors exist that the Southern Emperor’s tomb is in the Vermilion Bird Realm. Don’t you want to go and take a look?”

Mei Zihua’s eyes flickered as he wavered. “We have to talk about this. If we’re going, we have to make a huge fuss!”

The two looked at each other, and Li Wuyou smiled, “I share the same thought as you.”

In the Sword Sect, Lin Yun’s name had spread throughout the sect. When Mu Xuankong learned the news, he came to the Divine Firmament Peak and met the peak master, Mu Chuan. He spoke with excitement, “Mu Chuan, you know, right?”

Mu Chuan nodded with a smile.

“A twenty-seven-year-old Sword Saint! Even when the Sword Sect was at its prime, we didn’t have such an outstanding disciple,” Mu Xuankong lamented.

Mu Chuan laughed, “That means you have a unique eyesight. Don’t forget that you gave him a lot of treasures that even the disciples of the Scarlet Firmament Peak became jealous of.”

When Lin Yun had just come to the Sword Sect, Mu Xuankong took great care of him and gave him many treasures.

“It’s normal for youngsters to have some temper,” Mu Xuankong smiled. He didn’t just give Lin Yun treasures but also killed a Saint from the Qin Clan for Lin Yun.

“How’s your master’s situation?” Mu Xuankong came to ask about the Radiant Sword Saint’s situation. The Radiant Sword Saint was in seclusion behind the Divine Firmament Peak, with terrifying phenomena appearing. When he raised his head, he could see terrifying thunderclouds in the sky with lightning flashing, looking terrifying. This was a sign that an Emperor’s tribulation was arriving.

Mu Xuankong could tell how terrifying the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation was, which was only recorded in legends. He was a Great Saint now but could feel great pressure when he looked at it. He couldn’t imagine how terrifying it would become when the tribulation arrived.

“The tribulation has become clearer…” Mu Chuan sighed.

Mu Xuankong said, “Your master’s tribulation doesn’t look as simple as the other Emperors. This is too weird.”

“My master’s lifespan has already ended,” Mu Chuan said.

“H-How is that possible?” Mu Xuankong widened his mouth.

Mu Chuan replied, “My master didn’t have much lifespan left, not to mention after his battle with Tian Xuanzi. But life and death is nothing for master since he’s only holding on because of a breath, an obsession.”

“What obsession?”

“To become comparable to the Nine Emperors and take revenge for what Yu Qingfeng did three thousand years ago.” Mu Chuan continued with a complicated gaze, “If not for that obsession, my master would’ve become an Emperor by now.”

As the two talked, the younger generation of the Sword Sect gathered together. After Lin Yun left, they supported the entire Sword Sect, known as the Golden Generation. They rejoiced when they learned Lin Yun had become a Sword Saint.

“It’s a pity that Senior Sister Ye is still in seclusion. She would be happy if she knew about this,” Zhao Yan said.

Mu Qingqing smiled, “This is complicated. Ye Ziling is stubborn, wanting to obtain a divine physique. She has considered Lin Yun as her objective.”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Everyone was briefly stunned before they smiled with admiration in their eyes. Their strength was once on the same level, but they were already thrown far away. Even Zhao Yan didn’t dare to treat Lin Yun as his objective since it was too unrealistic.

Only Ye Ziling kept chasing after Lin Yun and never gave up. After she became a Saint, her potential as Jian Jingtian’s daughter was fully unleashed.

In the Heavenly Dao Sect’s Profound Maiden Courtyard, the Serene Dust Great Saint looked at Xin Yan with a complicated and helpless gaze. Xin Yan looked charming and bewitching, but she felt no desire.

The Serene Dust Great Saint knew that Xin Yan had surpassed her in terms of Buddhism because she had someone she couldn’t give up on. But Xin Yan had thought it through, hence surpassing her in Buddhism. This meant that Xin Yan’s cultivation would also surpass her own.

The Serene Dust Great Saint asked with heartache, “Have you made up your mind?”

“I have,” Xin Yan smiled. Now that she wanted to find a higher path, she was prepared to head to the legendary Buddhist holy land, the Canaan Monastery. No one knew where it was; only those fated could find it.

“Have you let go of him?” The Serene Dust Great Saint asked. “He has just become a Sword Saint.”

Xin Yan smiled, “Master, I have never let go of him. He’s even reflected in my saint origin. There’s nothing to let go of in this world. Even if trapped in the bottleneck, I can still look at the blue sky.”

The Serene Dust Great Saint was stunned and looked at Xin Yan with shock. She could sense that Xin Yan’s attainment in Buddhism had reached an extraordinary height. She said, “I believe you can find the Canaan Monastery.

In the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain, Mu Xueling was with Yue Weiwei. They rejoiced when they learned Lin Yun had become a Sword Saint, especially Yue Weiwei, who finally felt relieved. She also finally made up her mind. She looked at Mu Xueling with reluctance, “Can I still return to the Kunlun Realm if I take this trip?”

“You will if you fail. But you know that he’s a Sword Saint, and there’s nothing you can help him with even if you stayed behind,” Mu Xueling said. “You are the only divine maiden of the Heavenly Fox’s lineage in the Kunlun Realm. Don’t waste the opportunity that Aunt fought for you to have. Furthermore, will Lin Yun stay in the Kunlun Realm if he can get through this? He wants to become a Sword God, so you must keep up with him.”

Yue Weiwei lowered her voice with tears in her eyes, “I’m afraid that he can’t make it through this ordeal.”

“Don’t worry about him. Looking at him now, he’s probably going to steal the heart of the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s little princess,” Mu Xueling said.

Hearing that, Yue Weiwei smiled, “Big Brother Lin is a bad person. I got it, and I will accept the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain’s arrangement.”
