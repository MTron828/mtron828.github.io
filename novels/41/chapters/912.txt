Chapter 913 - Killing With One Sword

When the dragon aura appeared, Lin Yun’s aura wasn’t any weaker than Feng Wuji. Strangely, Lin Yun’s aura was stronger than Feng Wuji’s aura. Furthermore, Lin Yun had a foundation of two sword sutras, so when he released them, his entire temperament had undergone a change.

As the gold flames turned black, a black dragon claw enveloped in dragon flames flew out. Cracking sounds filled the air that forced Feng Wuji to examine Lin Yun.

“What…” Feng Wuji’s eyes flashed with shock. It was within his expectations that Lin Yun could use all eight seals and possibly reach the manifestation stage. He even increased his power as a precaution. But Lin Yun’s attack went against all logic. How could Lin Yun suddenly release an aura that didn’t belong to the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm?

Feng Wuji started to feel regret because he had underestimated Lin Yun. But it was too late for him to back off. Then, Lin Yun barked, “Too bad you can’t block this pitiful trick!”

The collision of the dragon claw and dragon looked like ferocious beasts in an ancient battle. When the phenomenon shattered, a figure was sent flying from the shockwave.

“Feng Wuji!” Everyone exclaimed because Feng Wuji lost the confrontation. It was an outcome that no one had expected.

“How is this possible…” The higher realms’ geniuses were completely dumbfounded.

On the other hand, Lin Yun was standing in his original position and hadn’t moved a single inch. Everyone began to wonder how he sent Feng Wuji flying when he was only from the Profound Amber Realm.

“Are my eyes messing with me?”

“He actually managed to take Feng Wuji’s attack head-on…”

“Not only did he take Feng Wuji’s attack head-on, but he even sent Feng Wuji flying away.” An uproar exploded after a brief silence because no one had expected to see Feng Wuji lose. If Feng Wuji didn’t already kill ten geniuses like ants, they would doubt his reputation.

Suddenly, a terrifying crimson radiance erupted from Feng Wuji as the aura he was giving off was comparable to the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Under his immense aura, the sky and earth started to tremble violently.

At this moment, everyone felt like they were choking. No one could utter a single word as Feng Wuji held onto his blade. Feng Wuji had finally brought out his dao artifact.

The pressure of the dao artifact was so strong that everyone felt like they were suffocating. Even Chen Xuan had fear flashing through his pupils because he had heard about Feng Wuji’s infamous dao artifact.

Even those who were quietly watching the show wore a grave expression because they knew that Feng Wuji was pulling out all of the stops.

Feng Wuji’s expression was terrifyingly dark because he knew that Lin Yun was a tough opponent. He had faced many geniuses that weren’t from the higher realms, but none of them were like Lin Yun. Who would have thought that Lin Yun wasn’t an ant that he could crush with the wave of his hand?

“You’re actually quite capable. I won’t feel at peace if I don’t get rid of you before seizing the Glorysun Spirit!” Feng Wuji squinted his eyes as he examined Lin Yun like a viper. He was trying his best to take Lin Yun’s life.

“You should keep trying. I’m interested to see what you’ll try to do,” said Lin Yun indifferently. Starlight suddenly started shining from the depths of Lin Yun’s pupils as a terrifying sword intent exploded from him. When Lin Yun’s sword intent reached the limit, a rumbling roar of lightning echoed in everyone's ears.

A beam of starlight enveloped Lin Yun and tore apart the flaming clouds in the sky. When everyone sensed the sword intent, the only thing that crossed their minds was the spiritual sword intent in complete mastery!

Everyone’s jaws dropped as they examined Lin Yun once again. How could Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent reach such an absurd height when he wasn’t even in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm?

At this moment, everyone knew why Lin Yun was so confident. It was quite obvious that Lin Yun was a swordsman who wasn’t afraid to fight.

“You think that only the geniuses from the higher realms are worthy of the treasures in the ruins? Sorry, but I don’t agree. If you want to do something about it, you’ll have to take my life. But… that depends on whether or not you have the courage to fight,” said Lin Yun while looking at Feng Wuji coldly.

Feng Wuji’s face became dark. Naturally, he never would have expected Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent was at complete mastery. Plus, if he insisted on killing Lin Yun, he would have to suffer some injuries even though he had a dao artifact.

If he was injured, the odds of obtaining the Glorysun Spirit would drop. In the end, Feng Wuji could only grit his teeth. He wasn’t sure what to do because he didn’t want to force himself into a dead end.

Suddenly, the pressure from the barrier with phenomena disappeared. This sudden change had instantly attracted everyone’s attention to the barrier. “The barrier has weakened!”

Damn it! Feng Wuji cursed inwardly at the ill-timing. Sensing that Mo Han and the rest were about to move, Feng Wuji couldn’t maintain his composure. With a cold look, he yelled at Lin Yun, “I’ll spare your pathetic life for now, but I’ll take your head sooner or later!”

After Feng Wuji yelled, Chen Xuan and Liu Yun felt relieved. Their backs were drenched in sweat, but they were finally able to relax. The barrier weakened at the perfect time. Even the other geniuses in the surroundings felt relieved because they knew that Lin Yun and Feng Wuji weren’t pushovers. If they were to fight with all of their strength, who knew what would happen to the spectators?

“Did I allow you to leave?” A cold voice echoed out as soon as the crowd felt relieved. Even Mo Han, Shi Feng, and Chen An who were about to enter the barrier came to a stop.

Their first reaction was to check if their ears were okay. After all, Feng Wuji was almost in the Azure Dragon Ranking and he was from the Bloodbone Realm. The Bloodbone Realm was considered a top-tier realm among the higher realms. If Feng Wuji didn’t have this background, he probably wouldn’t have a dao artifact.

Instead of rejoicing, Lin Yun was actually threatening Feng Wuji. Was he insane? At this moment, even the temptation of the Glorysun Spirit couldn’t stop everyone from looking at Lin Yun.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Feng Wuji snickered, “I don’t think I heard you correctly. Do you mind repeating what you just said?”

“I said, did I allow you to leave?” Lin Yun grinned, but his smile was even more terrifying than a devil from hell. At this moment, no one doubted Lin Yun’s words anymore.

Who the hell does Feng Wuji think he is to come and go as he pleases?

“Hahaha! I just realized that you’re a madman.” Feng Wuji was briefly stunned before he started laughing. “Since you’re courting death, I don’t mind fulfilling your wish. You say that you only need one sword to kill me, right? Let me see if your sword is faster than my blade. I’m standing right here. Come and kill me if you dare!”

Feng Wuji spat Lin Yun’s words back. He had nothing to prove because he knew that an ant was still an ant. He didn’t want to kill Lin Yun because he didn’t want to waste his energy. But that didn’t mean Lin Yun could push his buttons without consequence.

Feng Wuji had a temper. At this moment, he was determined to cripple Lin Yun even if he had to give up on the Glorysun Spirit. When he released his violent aura, killing intent also started flashing in his pupils.

Staring at Feng Wuji, everyone became quiet. They could tell that Feng Wuji was determined to kill Lin Yun even if he had to give up on the Glorysun Spirit. Clearly, Feng Wuji had lost all rationale.

But before anyone could feel sorry for Lin Yun, a crimson ray flashed with Feng Wuji’s head flying out. Meanwhile, Feng Wuji only managed to draw his blade by half an inch before his movements stopped.

No one had any idea what just happened.

“I told you, I only need one sword to kill you.” Lin Yun’s voice sounded out, waking everyone from their stupor.

A lake of a few hundred meters had appeared beneath Lin Yun’s feet without anyone realizing. An Azure Firmament Tree decorated with flower petals sat at the middle of the lake. At the same time, Lin Yun’s hair and clothes fluttered in the wind, but he wasn’t leaking any traces of killing intent. Instead, he had the aura of a celestial who had fallen to the earth, who maintained his elegance and grace.

His pupils were foggy as he slowly sheathed his sword as he just unleashed the Azure Lotus move. By the time Lin Yun sheathed his sword, Feng Wuji’s decapitated corpse fell to the ground.
