Chapter 1878 - A King's Return

When he was done speaking, Hou Feng used his fingers like a sword to stab at Lin Yun’s face.

Facing his attack, Lin Yun merely stomped his foot on the ground and gently retreated. His hair fluttered in the wind when he regained his footing and was ten-odd steps away.

This performance made all the eyes of the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples light up with disbelief. After all, Hou Feng was fast and ruthless, and there was no way Ye Qingtian could avoid this attack a year ago. Even if he could barely avoid Hou Feng’s attack, Ye Qingtian would be pathetic, unlike how he easily dodged the attack this time.

Could it be that Ye Qingtian had truly risen? He disappeared for a year and became a king when he returned. So this naturally made the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples excited.

Right then, the disciples guarding the Nether Orchid Courtyard came out. They were donning white robes, passing through the Nether Orchid Flowers and wielding their swords.

The commotion caused by Lin Yun and the Blue Curtain Peak’s disciples was great, and they had long discovered it. It was just that they couldn’t be bothered with it before.

The person leading the party was Ye Qing of the Nether Orchid Courtyard. He carried a sword in his hand with a jade ornament hanging on his waist. His cultivation was at the third channel of the Profound Death Stage, and his talent was outstanding amongst all the disciples in the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

“Senior Brother, it’s Ye Qingtian!” The faces of the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples changed. Even Ye Qing was stunned when he heard that because he never expected to run into a scumbag like Ye Qingtian here.

“That bastard actually dares to appear in the Nether Orchid Courtyard?! He’s too arrogant!”

“Wasn’t he already expelled from the Heavenly Dao Sect?”

“Senior Brother Ye, should we teach him a lesson?” The Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples were furious and emotional.

Even Ye Qing had disgust in his pupils and said in disdain, “There’s no need to dirty your hands with a scumbag like him.”

Lin Yun was facing off with Hou Feng, but he naturally heard those words. He inwardly sighed and wondered just how hateful was Ye Qingtian as a person that everyone wanted to teach him a lesson.

“It looks like you’re not welcome in the Nether Orchid Courtyard…” Hou Feng smiled and drew his sword to unleash ten-odd sword rays. He unleashed a total of seventy-two sword rays, and those sword rays combined to form a dragon.

His sword aura vibrated in the air, and this scene made the eyes of all Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples light up.

Even Lin Yun had to admit that this sword technique was pretty impressive. This was a sword technique, and it was also a sword array at the same time. This was the Qiu Dragon Sword Array. In the eyes of others, just the dragon aura alone was enough to intimidate everyone, and anyone trapped within it would definitely be dead.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“It’s the Qiu Dragon Sword Technique!” The Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples took in a deep breath, and they exclaimed, “It’s the ultimate technique of the Blue Curtain Peak. It’s not only a sword technique but also a sword array. It has a high requirement for the talent in the sword.”

“That Hou Feng is pretty impressive to reach this level in the Qiu Dragon Sword Technique before becoming a saint disciple.”

“Can Ye Qingtian block this sword?”

“Are you joking? A piece of garbage like him will probably go down on his knees immediately. Let’s just wait and watch!”

Hou Feng had charged over with the Qiu Dragon Sword Array, which looked like a terrifying dragon.

But facing his attack, Lin Yun couldn’t even be bothered to draw his sword and merely flicked his finger, executing the Flicking Divine Finger. As he circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, a black Netherflower appeared beneath his feet, and the nether energy released by his finger turned into a beam of sword ray.

When the sword ray clashed against Hou Feng’s attack, Hou Feng was sent flying away, and the Qiu Dragon began to fall apart. As the nether energy fell onto Hou Feng, it quickly began to corrode the dragon origin around him, soon leaving holes in his dragon origin.

Just when Hou Feng wanted to get up on his feet, he threw out a mouthful of blood before falling onto one knee. The nether energy had penetrated into his body, causing great damage to his internal organs. This scene naturally left everyone stumped.

Was this all an illusion? Hou Feng was actually defeated with just one move? How was this possible?!

“The Netherworld Sword Art! When did you practice the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra…” Hou Feng kneeled on the ground, looking at Lin Yun in disbelief.

Hearing what Hou Feng said, Lin Yun understood what was happening. Since his senior brother didn’t remind him not to use the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra within the Heavenly Dao Sect, this meant that Ye Qingtian must have practiced it.

“There are many things you’re unaware of,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

Everyone in the surroundings looked at this scene with disbelief. After all, they never expected Ye Qingtian, who was so weak a year ago, to suddenly become so powerful.

“Get lost. Don’t ever let me see you again.” Lin Yun said, completely showing the arrogance of Ye Qingtian. When he was done, he walked toward the Nether Orchid Courtyard. This scene made all the Indigo Thunder Peak's disciples come to their senses and charge forth.

“Stop right there!” Ye Qing and the other Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples came to their senses and stood before Lin Yun.

“Lecher, get lost immediately. The Nether Orchid Courtyard doesn’t welcome you, so don’t blame us for being impolite if you dare to take another step forth!” A Nether Orchid Courtyard’s female disciple furiously looked at Lin Yun.

The other male disciples were furious and glared at Lin Yun as if he were their greatest foe. This made Lin Yun suspicious because the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s reaction towards him was a little too great.

Ye Qing raised his eyes and looked at Lin Yun, “Ye Qingtian, get lost if you don’t want any trouble. The Nether Orchid Courtyard is holding a Sword Discussion Gathering, and this isn’t a place you should come.”

“I’m here to participate in the Sword Discussion Gathering.” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“Do you think you’re qualified? Look at yourself in the mirror. Even if we don’t hold what you did against you, when did your Indigo Thunder Peak possess the qualification to partake in the Sword Discussion Gathering? Aren’t all the disciples in your Indigo Thunder Peak garbage? Don’t you have any self-acknowledgment?” Ye Qing snickered in disdain.

Not only did he mock Ye Qingtian, but all the Indigo Thunder Peak disciples as well. This naturally made the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples furious, and they roared, “So what if we’re not qualified to participate? Can’t we go in and take a look?”

“Who said that the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples aren’t allowed into the Nether Orchid Courtyard?”

“Aren’t you guys a little too domineering?!”

“How noisy!” Ye Qing raised his eye with a hint of ferocity flashing across his pupils. He then unleashed several strands of sword rays by flicking his finger. Those who spoke earlier immediately suffered a huge hole in their chests.

Ye Qing was at the third channel of the Profound Death Stage, and he naturally could suppress all the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples as he wished.

This scene terrified Chen Feng, and he quickly hid behind Lin Yun to dodge Ye Qing’s attacks. The other Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples were terrified and fell silent, not daring to say another word.

Someone unhappily raised his head to look at Ye Qing, but was immediately sent flying away by a sword ray the next second.

Ye Qing indifferently said, “You guys are right. The Nether Orchid Courtyard doesn’t welcome anyone from the Indigo Thunder Peak. You guys are just pieces of garbage and the shame of the Heavenly Dao Sect.”

“Is that so? What if I insist on entering?” Lin Yun raised his head to look at Ye Qing. He didn’t fear Ye Qing, who was at the third channel of the Profound Death Stage.

“Ha.” Ye Qing sneered. “I’ll tell you honestly. Today's gathering is for geniuses who will be conferred as saint disciples in half a month. You will only be humiliated if you enter, and I’m afraid your existence will dirty everyone’s eyes.”

“The Profound Death Stage?” Lin Yun smiled. “What a coincidence because I have also reached the Profound Death Stage.”

When he finished, Lin Yun released his life and death channels, releasing an aura belonging to the Profound Death Stage.

The Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples were shocked when they saw this scene, and they couldn’t believe that Ye Qingtian was at the Profound Death Stage.

Ye Qing also squinted his eyes because Ye Qingtian could easily become a saint disciple if he reached the Profound Death Stage at such a young age. His status within the sect would drastically transform when he becomes a saint disciple.

“Brother Ye’s finger technique was pretty good, and I also have one myself that I’d like your guidance on.” Lin Yun wasn’t polite to Ye Qing and stabbed with two fingers. A Netherflower bloomed behind him as a sea of flowers overlapped, instantly bringing the power of his attack to a terrifying height.

Ye Qing didn’t even place Ye Qingtian in his eyes at all, so he naturally didn’t expect that Ye Qingtian would dare to attack him, which naturally startled him. In a hurry, an Orchid Sword Seal appeared on his chest, but Lin Yun’s fingers had already tapped on his chest before the seal could fully bloom.

The sword ray on Lin Yun’s fingers easily pierced through Ye Qing’s chest. Before Ye Qing could retreat, Lin Yun pushed his palm forth and landed on Ye Qing’s chest. The massive power made Ye Qing’s chest cave in, sending the latter flying away.

But Lin Yun didn’t let Ye Qing go so easily and dashed forth before dropping his foot down. Once his foot fell down, he stomped on Ye Qing. After he was done, Lin Yun sneered, “The Nether Orchid Courtyard doesn’t welcome the Indigo Thunder Peak? Watch how I go in, then!”

Lin Yun stomped on Ye Qing’s head, causing the latter to lose consciousness. He didn’t even bat another eye at Ye Qing, having only taught the latter a small lesson. After he was done, he stepped across Ye Qing’s body and walked toward the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

Naturally, this left all the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples dumbfounded because they didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to become so strong.

“Holy shit. Is this Senior Brother's return as a king?”

“Isn’t this a little too terrifying?”

“Just what did Senior Brother experience in the past year to become so powerful?” All the disciples of the Indigo Thunder Peak were beyond shock, but they soon rejoiced.

Chen Feng quickly followed Lin Yun when he saw the latter walking forth. Along the way, no one knew if he did it on purpose, but he also stepped on Ye Qing’s face. As for the other Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples, they naturally followed behind and continued forth, stepping on Ye Qing.

This immediately made the faces of the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples dark. When they came to their senses, they quickly stepped forth and helped Ye Qing up from the ground.

The place where the Sword Discussion Gathering was held was brightly lit, and everyone here was happily chatting with each other. Everyone from the various peaks were there, but two parties stood out amongst everyone there.

One party was donning white clothes with a Nether Orchid Flower decorating their collars, and they were emitting a powerful sword aura. They should be the host of the Sword Discussion Gathering, disciples of the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

The other was a group of people donned in blue robes, looking elegant and emitting a powerful mental energy. There was no exception that they were all powerful spiritualists and should be disciples of the Holy Spirit Courtyard.

Aside from the Profound Maiden Courtyard, two of the three courtyards were here.

Just when Lin Yun wanted to ask Lil’ Purple if she could sense the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, he noticed that the Nether Orchid Courtyard had fallen into a dead silence. The entire banquet became quiet, and everyone was looking at him as if they had seen a monster.

At the same time, a gaze harboring killing intent also fell onto him. When Lin Yun raised his head, it came from a white-dressed woman, the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden, Bai Shuying. Looking more closely at Bai Shuying, Lin Yun was shocked because this was the girl he previously met when he was being ranked on the Elysium Core Ranking.
