Chapter 1293 - Quasi-Saint Origin

Lin Yun’s words made everyone’s faces change in the palace, and they could even feel that their hearts were about to jump out of their chests. After all, what Lin Yun said was simply too arrogant.

No one dared to move with the three powerful sects facing off, but he kicked open the stone gate? His action was the same as slapping Ye Xun, Fang Muyang, and Xia Yunzhen on their faces. Could it be that he was a fool? Who did he think he was before the three powerful sects?

Ye Xun, Fang Muyang, and Xia Yunzhen’s faces sank. They noticed that there was someone on the altar when they came in, but they didn’t even place Lin Yun in their eyes. But who would have imagined that Lin Yun had disregarded them instead? This was simply an act of courting death.

When Lin Yun stepped onto the altar, the three made their moves and unleashed their strongest attacks. A blade ray flew across the sky. It was so dazzling that it made everyone have difficulty opening their eyes. This attack naturally came from the Ye Xun of the Heavenly Blade Pavilion.

Right at that moment, the entire underground palace began to tremble. When the stone tablet behind Fang Muyang was formed, stone fragments began to crumble, and the entire underground palace also began to crumble. He was radiating with emerald light as an emerald gigantic palm reached out.

“Die!” At the same time, the talisman in the hand of Xia Yunzhen began to glow even more brightly before it flew towards the altar like a bright sun. When the three powerful energies radiated in the palace, just the shockwaves alone sent everyone flying back and most of them fainted. In just a split second, the altar was left in pieces.

Those who saw this scene could feel their hearts throbbing violently with their faces pale. After all, the three attacks weren’t their strongest attacks, and the destructive prowess was shocking. They couldn’t imagine how strong the three of them were. At the same time, they didn’t think that Lin Yun could survive this attack.

“A mere fly dares to stand before us?” Ye Xun said while sheathing his sword.

“I’ve never seen such an arrogant person before in the Ancient Barren Domain,” said Fang Muyang with a mocking sneer.

“Looks like there really are all kinds of people in the Profound Wither Island,” said a smiling Xia Yunzhen while he summoned the talisman back to his hand. They might not have a good relationship with each other, but they recognized each other’s strengths. As for Lin Yun, they didn’t think that he even had the right to speak to them.

“Where’s that fellow’s corpse?” A powerful sect’s disciple asked.

“Corpse? Probably in pieces. My attack is enough to tear him into pieces,” said Ye Xun proudly.

“My palm is enough to crush him,” said Fang Muyang.

“My attack is enough to disintegrate him,” sneered Xia Yunzhen.

“If it’s not for the fact that I can still speak, I might really think that I’m already dead…” Right at that moment, a voice resounded within the palace. Before everyone could react, a powerful wind blew out and the cloud of dust was blown away.

Behind the altar’s rubble was a figure in the corner standing with a sword supported on the ground. He was enveloped in a purple and golden light. When that person raised his head, his cold expression made everyone’s hearts sink since he wasn’t dead.

This also made the faces of Xia Yunzhen, Ye Xun, and Fang Muyang change. All three of them were shocked with their jaws dropping. Not only was Lin Yun still alive, but he was even unharmed. This instantly made them feel like they were a joke, and their faces instantly became ugly.

“It's impolite not to make a return for what one receives, so I also have an attack, wanting to seek the guidance from all three of you.” But before the three could react, Lin Yun suddenly drew his sword.

As the Azure Firmament Tree appeared with Iris Flowers blooming on the branches, Lin Yun pushed the two sword sutras to the limit and a sword ray flew out. He was executing the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords at that moment.

The dazzling sword ray made Xia Yunzhen, Ye Xun, and Fang Muyang squint their eyes. But facing Lin Yun’s attack, they quickly retaliated. After the attacks from both sides collided, Xia Yunzhen, Ye Xun, and Fang Muyang took a step back with deep shock in their eyes.

Although they had underestimated their opponent, they were still shocked by the strength that Lin Yun had displayed. They instantly wondered if Lin Yun wasn’t from the Ancient Barren Domain, and this instantly made them no longer underestimate him.

As for those who were hiding in the surroundings, they were completely left dumbfounded by this scene. They couldn’t believe that not only was Lin Yun still alive after receiving Xia Yunzhen, Ye Xun, and Fang Muyang’s attacks, he even managed to make them take a step back with one sword. If news of this gets out, it would definitely cause a huge tremor on the Profound Wither Island.

“This is the Ancient Barren Domain, and there’s no place for an outsider like you to show off. Kneel!” The elder from the Thunder Sect snorted with a cold light flashing through his pupils, wanting to use his cultivation at the Greater Elysium Core Realm to suppress Lin Yun to beg for mercy.

“I advise you to behave yourself.” Lin Yun raised his head to glare at the old man.

“Who the hell do you think you are?” The old man sneered in disdain. At the same time, the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts from the two other sects also had killing auras surging in their pupils. They knew that it was best to suppress geniuses not from the Ancient Barren Domain, lest they grow up and become a threat in the future.

But very quickly, the old man from the Thunder Sect couldn’t smile anymore as the entire palace began to tremble. At the same time, cracks also began to appear on the roof. This was a dangerous sign because this meant that the underground palace was showing signs of collapse.

“What’s going on?!” The old man finally panicked and couldn’t pay any attention to Lin Yun. The spiritual array underground seemed to have been destroyed, and if this continued, not only could the underground palace collapse, but a destructive power would also explode.

“The altar was the core of this underground palace array. But since the altar was destroyed, it’s just a matter of time for the underground palace to collapse,” said Lin Yun under his mask. When Xia Yunzhen, Ye Xun, and Fang Muyang heard that, all three of their faces became ugly.

“Let’s move together to protect the underground palace!” The three Greater Elysium Core Realm experts released their astral energy, using their astral energies to form pillars to support the collapsing palace.

When the three of them made their moves, the tottering underground palace was instantly stabilized, but it was clear that this wouldn’t last for long.

“Well then, I’ll be taking a step ahead.” Lin Yun didn’t bother with them and sheathed his sword before jumping into the passage behind the altar.

“Let’s go!” Xia Yunzhen, Ye Xun, and Fang Muyang recovered from their shock and also entered the passage with the elites of their sects.

When Lin Yun came down, he could sense an eerie aura sweeping over him that made him feel a chill down his spine. The temperature here was unseasonably cold, and it even made his blood flow slow down.

“Lil’ Purple, what’s going on here? It might not be a coincidence for the three sects to come here,” said Lin Yun while he transmitted his voice.

“Weird…” Lil’ Purple muttered. “Be careful. I feel that the opportunity here might be a lot different from what this empress has predicted.”

“Where do I go?” Lin Yun asked. Right at that moment, Xia Yunzhen, Ye Xun, and Fang Muyang also appeared behind Lin Yun, along with their elites.

“You want to travel with us? This underground palace is preserved pretty well, and there are many opportunities here. It’s enough for us to split them up.” Fang Muyang smiled while throwing an invitation to Lin Yun. He wanted to probe Lin Yun because there were many pathways up ahead, and each of the pathway was emitting an eerie aura. This meant that it would be safer to travel in a huge party.

“You’re also here for the quasi-saint origin, right?” Xia Yunzhen asked. Regardless if they had any enmity against Lin Yun, they had changed their impression of him and no longer underestimated him.

Quasi-saint origin? Lin Yun’s heart began to throb and said, “It’s better to rely on our own abilities.”

When he was done, he headed in the direction that Lil’ Purple pointed out to him. This made Xia Yunzhen, Ye Xun, and Fang Muyang squint their eyes. But just when they wanted to chase after Lin Yun, he was already long gone.

“That fellow is really confident. Who knows how dangerous this ruin is, and he’ll probably die without knowing what happened.” Xia Yunzhen snorted. He then turned to Fang Muyang and continued, “You shouldn’t have invited him. He’s not qualified!”

But Fang Muyang briefly hesitated before he said, “I have a feeling that he’s ‘that’ person.”

“Who?”

“Flower Burial!” Fang Muyang said. When he was done, it instantly caused a huge uproar in the surroundings.

The name ‘Flower Burial’ might not be known by anyone in the Profound Azure Prefecture, but everyone from the eight strongest sects has heard of him. After all, he was the invincible champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, killing five and crippling five Realm Sons, and this was simply unprecedented.

Now that the champion of the other Heavenly Paths have started to show themselves and display their talent, only the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path was still a mystery. Much information about him was suppressed by the Nether Divinity Clan, and everyone only knew that he was called Flower Burial.

This made Flower Burial even more mysterious and also made everyone from the eight strongest sects to be curious about him.

“Don’t forget that Qin Cang is also on this island. So there’s no way he’ll dare to show himself,” said Xia Yunzhen. “You two want to travel together?”

Fang Muyang had no opinion about this because he was supportive of traveling together, to begin with. Ye Xun also replied, “I have no opinion about that. But that person is right, we can discuss the ownership of the other treasures, but we’ll depend on our own strength for the quasi-saint origin.”

“That’s for sure. With the three of us joining forces, we’ll be able to sweep through this underground palace,” replied Xia Yunzhen.

“I agree,” smiled Fang Muyang.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
