Chapter 1453 - You Want A Fight? I'll Give You A Fight!

Huangfu Yan smiled as he sent an arrogant look at Lin Yun. But Lin Yun merely ignored him because his gaze was on Chen Ling with his brows furrowed.

“You’re injured?”

“No, I’m fine…” Chen Ling smiled.

When Lin Yun examined Chen Ling, the astral energy protecting Chen Ling was shattered. Even if he didn’t fracture any of his bones, there were still some fine cracks on his bones. Not to mention the severity of his injuries, the culprit was really ruthless.

When he thought of what Huangfu Yan said about saving a hundred thousand contribution points, Lin Yun instantly figured it out. He looked at Huangfu Yan and asked, “You wanted to enter the Great Profound Palace earlier?”

“You’re not stupid,” Huangfu Yan smiled. “I was, indeed, planning to find you in the Great Profound Palace. But thanks to this junior brother of yours, I saved a hundred thousand contribution points. So, what do you think? Do you want to have some fun? Don’t tell me you don’t have the courage.”

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that before a cold light flashed across his pupils. He smiled. “I’m known for having a good temper. How can I compare to someone ranked in the top ten of the Earth Ranking? Chen Ling, let’s go.”

“You want to leave? You think I don’t exist?! Stop him!” Huangfu Yan’s face sank. He spent so much time preparing. So how could he possibly let Lin Yun leave just like that? He didn’t want to let Lin Yun go without teaching this so-called “heaven direct disciple” a lesson.

In the next second, two disciples who were standing behind Huangfu Yan charged towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun suddenly raised his head and sent a cold look at those two disciples. Lin Yun simply waved his hand as the black flower bloomed in his violet palace. A black beam swept through the two Azure Firmament Peak’s disciples, instantly eroding the astral energy that was enveloping them.

Before those two disciples could respond, Lin Yun reached out and grabbed onto their wrists, twisting their arms by 360 degrees. This made those two disciples scream in pain. But that wasn’t all, Lin Yun’s palms landed on them both.

As his strength swept out in waves and landed on their chests, Lin Yun easily created holes in their astral energies. They were both sent flying as they threw out a mouthful of blood. When they fell to the ground, they groaned in pain with their faces distorted.

This scene startled everyone in the surroundings, leaving them dumbfounded. This was simply a little too ruthless. Although Huangfu Yan had been tyrannical within the sect and never went easy whenever he taught someone a lesson, his brutality was nothing compared to Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s method made them feel a chill run down their spines because the two disciples were heavily injured. They were both at the two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. So this scene left everyone stumped.

The lips of the few Azure Firmament Peak’s disciples twitched as they subconsciously took several steps back. When their gazes fell onto Lin Yun, their eyes were filled with disbelief and shock. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

This was because Lin Yun had executed the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, and this was a little too unbelievable. After all, Lin Yun had just come out of the Great Profound Palace.

Huangfu Yan’s face sank, and he barked, “Flower Burial, looks like you really have a ‘good’ temper. Who do you think you are to teach the disciples of my Azure Firmament Peak a lesson?”

His roars rumbled like thunder, making the faces of everyone in the surroundings change because they could feel their internal organs shaking. As a boundless sea of clouds unfolded behind Huangfu Yan, his sword aura began to accumulate and the sea of clouds turned black with sword rays flickering like lightning. As the sky turned dark, the sword rays became extremely dazzling, making many people tremble in fear.

When the boundless sea of clouds, lightning, and sword rays swept toward Lin Yun, everyone in the surroundings quickly retreated. When their gazes fell onto Lin Yun, the sword aura surrounded him with lightning crackling. Huangfu Yan’s sword aura was like a giant hand that was trying to crush Lin Yun.

They instantly knew that Lin Yun was doomed because Huangfu Yan was furious. But just when Huangfu Yan’s sword aura was about to suppress Lin Yun, Lin Yun unleashed a roar. The sea of clouds split apart and sunlight shone down once more.

Then, a black flower slowly bloomed behind Lin Yun. When all nine petals opened up, Lin Yun’s sword aura reached the peak and filled half the horizon. This left everyone dumbfounded, and none of them could utter a word.

As the surroundings fell silent, Lin Yun’s indifferent roar echoed, “Who do you think you are to bully the disciples of my Divine Firmament Peak?!”

“It’s the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra!”

“Oh my god! Nine-Petaled Netherflower, he has reached the pinnacle of the second stage of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra!”

“How is this possible? How the hell did he manage to accomplish that? That’s the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra we’re talking about!” Everyone was shocked because Lin Yun reached the pinnacle of the second stage of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. Judging from his aura, he could reach the third stage anytime he wanted to!

But how is this possible? Everyone nearly went insane. Didn’t Lin Yun just come out from the Great Profound Palace? How did he manage to accomplish that? It makes no sense at all!

This had never happened in the history of the Sword Sect, meaning this was too insane. This also caused an uproar amongst the spectators in the surroundings. They were all shocked as they looked at the black Netherflower.

Even the Azure Firmament Peak’s disciples were stuttering when they spoke after looking at the Nine-Petaled Netherflower.

Everyone was shocked after seeing Lin Yun executing the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. It was still within their scope of acceptance if Lin Yun had reached the lesser first stage. But not only did Lin Yun manage to cultivate the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, he even reached the pinnacle second stage!

It had been hundreds of years since someone accomplished something like this. If it was in the Elysium Core Realm, it had been five hundred years since someone managed to achieve it.

Huangfu Yan’s face changed. He was naturally shocked the most amongst everyone there.

“I can’t teach the disciples of the Azure Firmament Peak a lesson?” A cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, and he continued, “Then let me tell you, too. Huangfu Yan, not just anyone can bully the disciples of my Divine Firmament Peak!”

Lin Yun’s words caused another wave of shock as everyone looked at him with complicated gazes. Was Lin Yun planning to stand out on behalf of the Divine Firmament Peak? All this time, the Divine Firmament Peak had no sense of existence amongst the seven peaks.

This was why no one thought it was inappropriate for Huangfu Yan to teach Lin Yun a lesson, and no one would care about it after giving it some time. No one would care about Chen Ling’s thoughts because he was only a disciple of the Divine Firmament Peak. After all, the Divine Firmament Peak didn’t have any disciples on the Earth and Heaven Ranking.

“So what if I bullied them? Come after me if you have the guts. I’m only asking if you dare to play with me without summoning constellations!” Huangfu Yan coldly said.

“Are you even worthy of playing with me?” Lin Yun ridiculed.

As rage blazed in Huangfu Yan’s heart, he said, “I thought you were humble. But it turns out that you’re really arrogant! Flower Burial, how impressive! Today, I’ll let you know the position of the Divine Firmament Peak in the Sword Sect!”

Huangfu Yan flew into a rage and charged forth with a boundless sword aura enveloping him. But Lin Yun grabbed Chen Ling and started dodging Huangfu Yan’s attack, refusing to fight him head-on. When the two clashed, Huangfu Yan was about to make a move several times, but Lin Yun was avoiding a head-on confrontation, leaving Huangfu Yan fuming.

“Lin Yun, is that all you’ve got?” Huangfu Yan raged. “Your Divine Firmament Sword Sutra is already at the pinnacle of the second stage. You don’t dare to fight me? Or you can’t afford to take a loss?”

“I can fight you. But if you lose, you must hand over a hundred thousand contribution points,” replied Lin Yun.

Huangfu Yan was stunned before he grinned, “That’s quite the appetite you have there! I’m just afraid that you can’t take it all! I can promise you, but you must hand over your status as a heaven direct disciple if you lose. Do you dare to take on the bet?”

The breathing of everyone in the surroundings became heavy when they heard that. Just as they had expected, Huangfu Yan came for the heaven direct disciple’s status. It looked like the top ten of the Earth Ranking were unhappy with Lin Yun becoming a heaven direct disciple.

But the stake of this gamble was too big. A hundred thousand contribution points was great, but it was nothing compared to the status as a heaven direct disciple. If Lin Yun wasn’t stupid, he wouldn’t agree to Huangfu Yan’s bet, right?

“Senior Brother, don’t take on the bet.” Chen Ling said with his face changed.

“Sounds good. I can give up on the status as a heaven direct disciple if I lose since I don’t deserve it if I lose to someone like you.” Lin Yun was waiting for Huangfu Yan to take on the bet. Once he took it, how could he refuse it?

Those at the top ten didn’t put him in their eyes, but he also didn’t put them in his eyes, either. He slaughtered his way from the Profound Amber Realm to the Kunlun Realm, and he was never afraid of anyone.

Since Huangfu Yan wants a fight, I’ll give him a fight!
