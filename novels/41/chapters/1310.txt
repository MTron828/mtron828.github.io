Chapter 1311 - Finally

The blazing sacred flames were burning the surrounding space, making the entire blue space look gorgeous and glittering. As for Serene Night, she was standing on the huge flower, looking at Lin Yun. Her flawless face looked sinister at this moment, and her pupils were glowing brightly.

“So, it’s in her eyes.” Lin Yun was surprised to discover that her origin saint runes were hidden in her pupils. He now knew why she could still be so strong even after leaving the flower, and the Serene Night was truly strong. Now that he thought about it again, if he didn’t have such a terrifying amount of vitality and didn’t fear her illusions, it would have been troublesome for him to deal with her.

After all, she was comparable to a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert by herself. But it was a pity that she ran into Lin Yun. After Lin Yun created his own Sovereign Constellation, there was no longer any place for her to be arrogant.

“Be obedient and be my host!” The demonic runes on her began to glow and the origin saint rune in her pupils also began to revolve rapidly, distorting the entire space within her vision.

Since Lin Yun was in it, he could feel the great restriction on his movement technique. Even his sword intent and senses were disrupted and became distorted. Right at that moment, a piercing peal of laughter resounded as the Serene Night charged over with razor-sharp nails extending from her fingers. Furthermore, her nails were engraved with saint runes, making her nails even more terrifying.

Lin Yun immediately tried to dodge the attack using the Golden Crow Nine Transformation, creating multiple afterimages. But it felt as though he was in a swamp, and his movements were greatly restricted. When the Serene Night’s attack reached, Lin Yun still suffered some superficial wounds on his face, even though he had already responded quickly.

“Tsk, tsk. What delicious blood!” The Serene Night smiled while licking her fingers. Under the control of the origin saint rune in her pupils, the demonic runes covering her body unleashed a bright flare of demonic light.

Her attacks were quick, and she was as slippery as a fish in this distorted space. She had fully unleashed the terror of the origin saint rune, such as distorting space or having nails as tough as saint artifacts. But as everything added up together, it allowed her strength to undergo a huge boost. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun had already exchanged ten-odd moves with the Serene Night. Although he had avoided having his vital spots hit, the Serene Night still managed to leave wound after wound on his body.

When he glanced down at the summit of the mountain, the Blood Flame Divine Rune was still enveloped in a cocoon and showed no signs of breaking out. Without the divine rune, his Azure Dragon Saint Art had been greatly weakened.

“Hehe, you’re the perfect host that I’ve had an eye on. You’re really strong to be able to force me to this point!” The Serene Night’s voice resounded. As she attacked, her voice continued to resound, trying to strum Lin Yun’s heartstrings, “But you’re not like the others. As my host, you’re the host and I’ll be your servant. I know a lot of ancient secrets, and those transcendent geniuses will be nothing if you have my help!”

But Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t fall for it. He was observing, trying to discover the profundity behind her origin saint rune. Just like that, an hour passed but Lin Yun showed no signs of anxiety on his face.

On the other hand, the Serene Night gradually became more anxious with wrinkles beginning to appear on her skin, but they were swiftly suppressed by the demonic runes on her body.

When Lin Yun saw this scene, he knew that his speculation was right. Without a host, the Serene Night would have to pay a great price to utilize her origin saint rune.

“Hmph, you’re a bad person. I’m already so good, but you’re not taking it at all. Looks like I can only kill you, then!” The Serene Night snorted with a vicious expression before she waved her hand. All the flower petals were gathered and formed into layers of sea clouds, swiftly trapping Lin Yun in the flower bud. The bud of the Serene Night was a wisp of green flames that emitted a relaxing fragrance and a sacred aura.

At this moment, Lin Yun finally realized that the bud was the core of the Serene Night, and the woman was the demonic trait of it.

“You don’t seem to be worried at all.” The woman coldly looked at Lin Yun. Even after being trapped, Lin Yun still looked calm and emitted a strong pressure.

“This is the Serene Night Flame?” Lin Yun asked, looking at the green bud as though the woman wasn’t an enemy but a friend.

Hearing what he said, the woman had surprise flashing through her pupils, but she still kept her mouth shut.

“It looks like you can’t fully control it yet…” Lin Yun said, not waiting for her reply.

“How can you know that?” The woman was utterly shocked with disbelief when she heard what Lin Yun said. But the moment she spoke, her face became ugly because she knew that she shouldn’t have said anything.

“It’s still sleeping while you’re awake. You’re afraid. Afraid that you’ll cease to exist the moment it wakes up. After all, you’re just the accumulated demonic trait of the flower, and you’re incredibly weak compared to it.” Lin Yun was even more sure of his speculation when he looked at the bud.

The flower bud was the true Serene Night, and the woman should be the manifestation of the accumulated demonic trait, such as how there would be impurities left in the body after consuming pellets. But if she didn’t come for him, she might have had a chance of replacing the bud as the core and become an unrivaled demonic flower in the future.

“So what if you’ve discovered my secret?” The woman’s face became sinister and laughed, “There’s no way you can escape, even if you’re a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert. After you become my host, I’ll make you my slave for eternity!”

As demonic runes began to shine on the surrounding flower petals, this entire space formed into a bizarre cage, and Lin Yun was shocked that this place was isolated from the outside world, and the astral energy within his body had weirdly become stagnant.

“Did you sense it?” The woman wore a mocking smile and continued, “It’s good that you’re prideful enough. Otherwise, I’d have some trouble trapping you in the flower bud. But it’s useless for you to regret it now!”

Vines began to stretch out from the surrounding petal walls and locked onto Lin Yun. The vines were quick, and they had instantly rendered him immobilized.

As the woman smiled, she slowly approached and reached out for Lin Yun’s chest while licking her lips with greed flashing in her eyes as she looked at him. In her eyes, Lin Yun was merely a delicacy to her. But just when her hand was about to get close, she suddenly froze under immense pressure.

“What’s going on?” The woman was surprised because she couldn’t figure out what was going on. When she raised her head, she was horrified to discover that a golden scroll had appeared behind Lin Yun.

Before she could utter a word, the painting opened up from a seam with an explosion of golden light. This instantly sent the woman flying back and threw out a mouthful of blood when she collided with the wall.

“Constellation?” The woman was shocked because Lin Yun had never shown his constellation before. But this also meant that his constellation was somewhat terrifying since it sent her flying back before it even unfold completely.

As the scroll slowly unfolded, the vines trapping Lin Yun began to snap into pieces. As the vines slowly shattered, the woman fell to her knees with her face distorted from the pain.

“I have to thank you. Without your help, I wouldn’t have been able to find out where the true Serene Night was located.” Lin Yun said, looking at the Serene Night with his eyes blazing with excitement. This was the flower that his Flower Burial Sword needed. The woman was only the demonic trait of the origin saint rune, and her existence was more like a demonic existence, rather than a flower.

“Sovereign…Constellation…” The woman was shocked with her mouth wide open as she looked at the golden painting behind Lin Yun.

“No!” The woman screamed and used all her strength to stand on her feet before pouncing towards Lin Yun.

But right at that moment, the painting involving the Aurora Dragon opened up, and a boundless force swept out, instantly destroying the cage of petals. When Lin Yun sensed that the boundless energy coming from his constellation was empowering him, he pointed a finger, and the women that pounced at him was reduced to ashes by the immense power.

This was simply too terrifying. Lin Yun had only used one finger and one painting to destroy the woman before him, and the power from the Sovereign Constellation made him feel unreal.

When Lin Yun let out a long breath, he felt satisfied. He was Flower Burial, someone who slaughtered his way from the lower realm and had consumed countless treasures along the way. Not to mention that he had obtained the opportunities from Iris Sword Saint and the Azure Dragon Lord. If he was from a holy land, he would’ve been invincible by now.

As for what invincible means? It simply meant that those who obey him will prosper, and those who defy him will perish. But Lin Yun was greatly restricted. He couldn’t manifest his constellation before, and he had to exchange over a few hundred moves with transcendent geniuses from the big sects without using the firmament sword intent.

If he had faced those transcendent geniuses from powerful sects, he would have had to use all his trump cards, aside from the firmament sword intent. It was so much so that he even would have had to use the Myriad Sword Condensation.

They weren’t strong, but their cultivation was too high, and they possessed their own constellations. The moment they summoned their constellation, their strength would boost greatly, and Lin Yun had pent everything up till now ever since he entered the Profound Wither Island. But starting from today, he would like to see who would dare to bully him with their constellation!
