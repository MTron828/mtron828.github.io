Chapter 948 - Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm

Time passed quickly while Lin Yun and Lil’ Red cultivated. In the blink of an eye, 40 days had passed.

On this morning, Lin Yun was basking in sunlight while he practiced the Divine Glorysun Fist. It took 40 days for the Divine Glorysun Fist to start taking form in Lin Yun’s hands.

Lin Yun threw out the Divine Sun Breaking Seal in the vast valley. When the seal bloomed, the gigantic winged human appeared behind him while its wings covered the sky. The winged human looked alive and was different from the phenomena manifested by others.

Aside from the glory that the winged human emitted, there was also a black space behind Lin Yun that looked terrifying. But Lin Yun didn’t unleash the seal like he did in the past. Instead, he allowed the golden sun to bloom in his palm before he clenched his fist. “First Form of the Divine Glorysun Fist—Cloud Dispelling Sun!”

As he threw his punch out, the winged human’s aura started rising violently as golden light shined out. At the same time, a lesser seal appeared behind the winged human like a star.

“Second Form! Eastern Purple Aura!” With boundless purple gleam, the sun rose full of vitality. In a split second, the entire heaven and earth lit up. With the second move, another golden seal appeared behind the winged human like a star.

“Third Form! Rising Flames!” When Lin Yun threw out a third punch, a new sun appeared in the sky that shined brightly. At the same time, a third seal appeared behind the winged human.

When the third seal appeared, the winged human emitted a terrifying pressure full of dignity and splendor. At the same time, sweat rolled down Lin Yun’s forehead because he was barely holding on. He reached the critical moment where he needed to merge the three seals together. Only then would he be able to execute Divine Sun Annihilation.

The difficulty left him in a pathetic state as his meridians were nearly incinerated. Basically, his origin energy couldn’t keep up with the amount of energy he was exhausting. However, he was confident he could succeed after his numerous failures.

The three seals began to rapidly spin as the winged human grew three times larger. As expected, all of Lin Yun’s origin energy was being sucked dry. However, he grit his teeth and persevered.

“Divine Sun Annihilation!” As soon as the last word left Lin Yun’s mouth, the feathers on the winged human shined brightly. All of the light gathered on the winged human, leaving the entire region in darkness. Then, a destructive aura suddenly exploded.

When Lin Yun threw out his punch, a boundless golden brilliance incinerated the demonic clouds in the sky. Once the starry sky was revealed, the valley was covered in starlight.

Lin Yun let out a deep sigh as sweat covered his pale face. His eyes were full of excitement as he watched the golden brilliance disappear. A terrifying crater appeared in front of Lin Yun that was over a few hundred meters wide. The crater was so deep that he could see golden flames underneath the Ash Mountain Range.

“I succeeded!” Lin Yun clenched his fist in satisfaction. All of the pain and torture that he suffered for 40 days had finally paid off.

After taking a minute to rest, Lin Yun soared into the sky and executed Hovering Sun, Solar Noon, and Absolute Dominance in a single breath. The attacks created various phenomena in the sky that were completely different from the first three forms. These forms focused on the rising sun, so their power was full of dominance.

After he was done practicing, Lin Yun burst out in laughter. It took him 40 days to complete the first six forms of the Divine Glorysun Fist. Now, the only thing holding him back was his cultivation and physique. It was already difficult for him to combine the first three forms, so combining six was near impossible.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, his eyes flashed with excitement, “I finally have another trump card!”

Luckily for Lin Yun, he had reached the pinnacle first soul Heavenly Soul Realm after forty days. As long as he wanted to, he could try the second tribulation. If he was successful, he might be able to combine six forms of the Divine Glorysun Fist.

At this moment, there were only 15 days until the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm opened. It was sure to draw the attention of all top-tier experts in the Azure Dragon Region, including the other regions. Of course, the Bloodbone Realm was sure to be present.

By this point, the leader of the Bloodbone Realm must have reached the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Kong Xuan’s death dealt a heavy blow to the Bloodbone Realm’s strength and reputation, so they were sure to take note of Lin Yun.

After all, if Liu Mu, the leader of the Bloodbone Realm, wanted to redeem the Bloodbone Realm, he would have to kill Lin Yun.

So Lin Yun needed to maintain a strong stance. Otherwise, the higher realms would target him and his treasures. His inheritances and treasures were especially interesting since they weren’t ordinary by any means.

By now, Lin Yun’s reputation had spread wildly. Even the seven heads of the Azure Dragon Ranking couldn’t suppress Lin Yun’s reputation. He was especially popular since he didn’t rely on a realm to back him up.

However, the reason for his popularity was the very same reason why he needed to intimidate everyone. As Lin Yun thought about this, a ferocious roar suddenly jolted him awake. As he turned his head, he saw the dracoape statue shatter.

Lil’ Red was still in its Dragon Blooded Cat form as it soared into the sky. At this moment, Lil’ Red looked a little fat. However, it was still unleashing an enormous and terrifying aura.

“Second soul Heavenly Soul Realm!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with joy because Lil’ Red had finally undergone a transformation. After refining the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s blood essence, its fur turned black. Additionally, the mighty aura of a king radiating from Lil’ Red’s pupils. It was using the monarch aura that belonged to the Gold-furred Demonic Ape.

Lin Yun was shocked. If he didn’t use his sky sword intent, it would be difficult for him to face Lil’ Red’s monarch aura. However, this change brought a smile to Lin Yun’s face.

Suddenly, Lil’ Red spat out the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff. It kept its interspatial pouch in its stomach, so it had to spit the staff out to use it. It seemed strange, but it was no different from how others retrieved someone from their interspatial pouch.

When the saint runes on the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff flashed, an ancient dazzling brilliance distorted the space in front of Lil’ Red. The distortion caused the surrounding mountains to look like illusions.

Then, Lil’ Red smashed Lin Yun with the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff. In that split second, a violent aura poured towards Lin Yun. If Lin Yun hadn’t made any improvements, he would have been made a fool by Lil’ Red. With a smile, he executed the Divine Glorysun Fist right before the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff reached him. An earth-shattering explosion resounded from the collision, which instantly destroyed all of the phenomena.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Now that Lin Yun was done, he grabbed the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff and competed with Lil’ Red in strength. As they competed, the mountain range started to crumble.

At this moment, Lin Yun could see the firm light in Lil’ Red’s pupils.

It looks like this fool has become a lot more intelligent. As soon as Lin Yun praised Lil’ Red, Lil’ Red chuckled with an adorable face. However, it was only adorable in Lin Yun’s eyes. If anyone else saw this, they would find Lil’ Red’s face to be a little despicable.

When Lin Yun let go of the staff, Lil’ Red swallowed the staff and jumped on Lin Yun’s shoulder. Now, they were ready to go to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. With only ten days left, Lin Yun was certain that Liu Mu, the leader of the Bloodbone Realm, would make an entrance. He couldn’t wait to meet Liu Mu and teach the entire Bloodbone Realm not to provoke him.
