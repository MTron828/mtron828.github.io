Chapter 1788 - Nethermoon Saint Armor

The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s disciples quickly rushed over to catch Zhang Yu, while furiously glaring at Ao Feng. Simultaneously, Zhang Yu’s defeat shocked everyone at Thunderblood Square.

To defeat Zhang Yu so easily was something that no one else in the top ten could accomplish, aside from the top three. For a moment, the Thunderblood Battlestage was in dead silence.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ao Feng arrogantly swept his gaze around before stopping on the pavilions that the six holy lands’ main representatives and the Four Young Masters were at. He smiled, “Is this the best the Martial Dao Tea Party has to offer? Does anyone else dare to fight me?”

He had completely disregarded the holy lands’ main representatives and the Four Young Masters, This naturally made many people furiously grind their teeth. But there was no response to Ao Feng’s words. This was because he had proven his strength earlier in his fight with Zhang Yu.

Many people’s gazes were on Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and the Autumn Mountain Lord. The three’s faces had changed, but none of them acted rashly. Most importantly, they weren’t able to see the limit of Ao Feng’s strength.

Aside from that, they were also worried that the other two might acquire an advantage if they made a move, thus causing them to lose their chance at first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

When Lin Yun saw this scene, he shook his head. It was good to be cautious, but if they were too cautious, they would lose their fangs. So even if they were strong, they would easily be looked down on by others because of it.

In fact, if one looked at it closely, these people already lost their fangs to compete for the first position after Jian Jingtian left the Dragon Pulse Ranking. Even if they couldn’t defeat Jian Jingtian, they should at least have the courage to fight.

Seeing no response from the surroundings, Ao Feng laughed. As he looked around, he revealed a playful gaze and said in a deep voice, “Is there really no one capable of competing with my Blood Moon Sect in the Eastern Desolation?”

His arrogance and contempt for the Eastern Desolation instantly detonated the fury of many people.

“Hahaha!” Wind God General Yan Cangming laughed. He then sneered, “Perhaps I shouldn’t have come. It looks like the Dragon Pulse Ranking is a joke in the Eastern Desolation.”

Right then, Yi Feng of the Myriad Lightning Sect stood out. A stern look appeared on his tender face, and he coldly said, “Do you really think the Eastern Desolation is a place where people like you can act wildly? I’m Yi Feng of the Myriad Lightning Sect, and I'd like to challenge you!”

But he wasn’t the only one. Yan Tie, who was seated beside Lin Yun, also stood up. He looked at Ao Feng and said, “Yan Tie, a swordsman!”

He practically died down after losing to Lin Yun. But when Lin Yun made a breakthrough in his Azure Dragon Intent, he had gotten stronger after observing Lin Yun’s breakthrough. So he couldn’t keep sitting after seeing the two being so arrogant.

When Yan Tie and Yi Feng stood up, they executed their movement techniques and appeared on the Thunderblood Battlestage. This caused an uproar around the Thunderblood Battlestage, and everyone’s mood was high.

It was needless to say about Yi Feng. He was the youngest amongst the top ten on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, and no one could confidently beat him, aside from the top three on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. As for Yan Tie, he did lose to Lin Yun. But everyone soon realized that it wasn’t because Yan Tie was weak, but because Lin Yun was too strong, since he had even defeated the Wind Edge Lord.

“You want to challenge me? After watching for so long, I do need to stretch my muscles a little.” When Yan Cangming saw Yi Feng looking at him, he smiled and jumped to the stage.

Yi Feng executed the Indigo Lightning Saint Canon with his dragon origin containing lightning appearing around him. It was like a massive sun that enveloped him within it.

“Divine Indigo Radiant Fist!” Killing intent flashed across Yi Feng’s pupils. When his dragon origin burst out, it formed into a lightning fist that flew over.

“Great!” Yan Cangming laughed, facing Yi Feng’s attack with his palm. When a massive fist collided with a palm, an explosion occurred when they came in contact. A powerful shockwave swept out along with dragon origin.

The energy shockwave covered the entire Thunderblood Battlestage, and the saint blood on the ground was instantly ignited. Yan Cangming and Yi Feng both took a step back. Yan Cangming swiftly regained his footing, and he smiled, “Pretty impressive for the Myriad Lightning Sect. You’re still young, but there’s no need for you to waste your time in the Myriad Lightning Sect. How about considering joining my Blood Moon Sect?”

“Are you humiliating me?” Yi Feng roared furiously.

“Ha. I can only teach you a lesson now, then!” Yan Cangming’s gaze became eerie with a bloody radiance surging from his body before sweeping out like a wave.

In the blink of an eye, the bloody radiance enveloped the entire stage, and Yi Feng was shocked to discover that his dragon origin was disappearing at a rapid speed. It was slowly being devoured by the blood cloud. The devouring power contained within the blood radiance was even stronger than his Devour Saint Rune.

How did he manage to do it? Even my Devour Saint Rune isn’t that domineering. With such a domineering devouring power, isn’t he afraid of suffering the backlash? Yi Feng’s face changed and was inwardly shocked. Devouring power was considered unorthodox, and it would fall into the demonic path if he cultivated it for too long. They would only know how to devour blindly and forget their own cultivation.

Although one’s cultivation could rise rapidly through it, one would suffer a backlash from the mixture of complicated energies in the long run. If one wasn’t strong enough, this method would ruin their foundation, sooner or later.

The current situation was dangerous, and Yi Feng could only infuse his Devour Saint Rune into the Divine Indigo Radiant Fist to face Yan Cangming. After they exchanged three moves, Yan Cangming didn’t take a step back, but Yi Feng took several steps back.

At the same time, Yan Tie was intensely clashing with Ao Feng. Yan Tie was known as the Death Swordsman. Once his Death and Firmament Sword Intents combined together, he had come in contact with the threshold of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. He had fully displayed this in his previous fight with Lin Yun.

He turned around and thrust his sword forth, with his attack containing a boundless deathly aura. When it combined with his sword intent, it formed a massive dragon aura that charged towards Ao Feng. Death Sword Intent had a strong corrosive ability, and Ao Feng’s blood-colored baleful aura was swiftly being corroded.

This made everyone’s eyes light up because the Death Sword Intent seemed to be effective against the blood-colored baleful aura.

“Death Dance—Radiant Moon!” The black moon appeared, and the sky turned dark with Yan Tie’s massive dragon aura spreading out. When he danced under the moon, nine sword auras manifested into nine dragons that emitted a powerful corrosive aura.

“His Death Dance seems to be stronger than before!”

“It appears that he has gotten stronger after his fight with Lin Xiao. Just relying on this sword alone, he’s capable of making it into the top ten!”

“Yan Tie has high odds of defeating Ao Feng!”

Everyone who was observing the battle was calmly analyzing the situation and didn’t dare to become too excited. This was because the shadow Ao Feng gave them was too great, and no one dared to underestimate him.

On the Thunderblood Battlestage, Ao Feng stood with a smile and didn’t move. Suddenly, he pushed his hands to the sides and his black robe exploded, revealing a crimson armor on his body, emitting a crimson radiance that looked like a scorching sun.

“Oh raging sacred flames, ignite my body and welcome the Blood Ancestor!” Ao Feng took a step forth, and faced the nine deathly sword rays. When a flaming palm engraving with saint runes flew forth in a certain direction, the sword rays were all shattered.

When everyone saw this scene, they were shocked because they never expected Ao Feng to be so strong. Even when Lin Yun faced the Death Dance earlier, he had to resort to his trump cards to win. But it was different for Ao Feng. He didn’t even bother dodging, but merely resolved Yan Tie’s attack head-on.

Seeing this, the Autumn Mountain Lord’s face changed, and he said, “That’s impossible. Under the same cultivation, how can someone possibly rely on their cultivation to break a ghost spirit martial technique?!”

The Death Dance was a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique, containing Death Intent and a powerful Sword Intent. Based on his cultivation, he couldn’t rely on his cultivation to face it head-on, not to mention break it. It was impossible unless he used his martial technique.

Since he couldn’t accomplish it, that meant neither could Ji Lingfeng nor Xiao Yuanqi. This power no longer belonged to the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Lin Qingyang of the Divine Dao Pavilion said, “He used an external item. That armor should be a Glory Saint Artifact, the Nethermoon Saint Armor!”
