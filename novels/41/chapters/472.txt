Chapter 473 - Empress

Listening to the two seniors’ laughter, Lin Yun revealed a smile and sighed out of relief. He needed courage to say those words before two Heavenly Soul Realm experts, but he meant what he said. If the two elders needed his help one day, he would definitely not bat an eye.

“Pavilion Master is right. I’m not in a rush to leave and my cultivation still hasn’t stabilized. I need to calm down for a brief moment,” muttered Lin Yun as he retrieved the mat he got from the Demonlotus Realm to meditate.

As he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, spiritual energy began to pour into his body from all directions. As the Iris Flower bloomed in his dantian, his profound veins began to glow with purple origin energy. The origin energy felt like an explosive volcano and Lin Yun could sense the power filling his body. He only needed a single thought to unleash power that far exceeded the Violet Palace Realm. If he was to face a Violet Palace realm elder right now, he had at least 60% confidence of winning.

This was all due to the three origins left behind by Guardian Plum. It was also thanks to the Iris Sword Sutra. After all, it was an ancient cultivation technique. But the cultivation technique had been stuck in the ninth stage for a long time now, unlike how it easily leveled up in the past.

Even if it was an ancient cultivation technique, it still had a strict requirement. Otherwise, he would end up just like Qin Yu who ran amok when cultivating an earth grade cultivation technique.

But it wouldn’t be easy for him to reach the Violet Palace Realm. The so-called Violet Palace Realm meant opening a violet palace in your dantian and allowing your origin energy to condense into liquid. It wasn’t easy to do this and every failure would bring upon the origin energy backlash. In serious cases, the cultivator would fall from their current cultivation. So breaking through wasn’t advised unless one was confident.

But making a breakthrough usually required heaven-defying aptitude like Bai Lixuan, a miraculous encounter, or a senior from an overlord force to guide you. Otherwise, you would spend years before making a breakthrough.

The Violet Palace Realm was an important threshold. Usually if you weren’t able to reach the Violet Palace Realm within three years after reaching quasi-Violet Palace Realm, you would practically lose your chance of reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm. So Lin Yun wanted to find a chance and get guidance from Jian Xuanhe.

When he looked into his dantian, he saw two ferocious martial souls standing side by side. They were the Qiongqi and Aurora Dragon. Qiongqi’s birth surprised Lin Yun because the ‘broken sword’ martial soul was released by an inch when he grasped the xiantian sword intent. The chain breaking was the catalyst of forthe Qiongqi to appear.

Everyone thought that his martial souls were two Primordial Chaotic Souls, but Lin Yun knew that the mysterious ‘broken sword’ was his genuine martial soul. The Qiongqi and Aurora Dragon were just extras. But it was a pity that he was still a long way from releasing his true martial soul. Just reaching the Violet Palace Realm alone was a headache to him.

Time gradually passed and Lin Yun had been focused on cultivating. After the Iris Sword Sutra reached the ninth stage, he could tell that it was completely different from the eighth stage. It wasn’t easy trying to open up a channel in his meridians. There were many mysterious acupoints converging together. What Lin Yun had to do right now was to complete a complete cycle to refine his origin energy.

By taking another step in refining his origin energy, his origin energy would be comparable to his sword aura. But it wasn’t easy trying to make a complete cycle with the Iris Sword Sutra. Beads of sweat soon covered his forehead because this was the first time he tried cultivating ever since he reached the ninth stage. After all, he didn’t have the luxury of time to do so in the Dragon Gate Competition.

As time slowly passed, a white strand appeared in his violet origin energy. The white strand of energy was shining brightly like the sun.

Lin Yun opened his eyes and let out a long breath as exhaustion was written all over his face. “The ninth stage of the Iris Sword Sutra is comparable to ordinary earth grade cultivation techniques. But the difficulty in cultivating it cannot be underestimated. Just making one complete cycle took three days…”

The ninth stage of the Iris Sword Sutra was an important threshold. He could rotate the Iris Flower reversely to gain a huge boost in his origin energy. When he reached the pinnacle ninth stage, he would be able to form the Iris Sword Array.

According to the records, he could summon a Violet Ice Sparrow in the tenth stage. At the thirteenth stage, he could condense the Iris Sacred Flame that could incinerate everything. At the sixteenth stage, upon complete mastery, he would be able to refine the sword box.

After another three days, Lin Yun and Xin Yan returned to the sect. Lin Yun spent most of his time cultivating the Iris Sword Sutra at night to refine his origin energy. During the day, he would practice the Aquaselenic Sword. Right now, using the Aquaselenic Sword was as easy as flexing his muscles.

It had nothing to do with his cultivation, but the fact that he grasped the complete xiantian sword intent. Now, the Aquaselenic Sword was insufficient for him.

Five days later, at the Locket Mountain, Lin Yun was still practicing the Aquaselenic Sword. A bright radiance suddenly bloomed from the Flower Burial Sword that lit up the horizon. “Luminous Moon!”

“Myriad Frost!” Lin Yun swept his glance out and pointed his sword forward. The Flower Burial Sword began to buzz with boundless chill sweeping out, freezing everything. Then, Lin Yun divided into nine afterimages. When the afterimages all combined together, Lin Yun swung out his sword. He was unleashing Moon Reflection.

Under his sword, the hundred meter cliff was separated into two. When Lin Yun landed on the ground, fragments of large rocks were falling down.

“Lin...Yun…” A grey-clothed deacon was dumbfounded when he saw this scene that even his voice trembled. Was Lin Yun really in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm? Just looking at Lin Yun made him feel like he was under great pressure.

Lin Yun sheathed his sword and landed on the ground. Only then did the deacon let out a breath of relief.

“What’s the matter?” asked Lin Yun.

The deacon was briefly stunned before he replied, “Guardian Plum told me to come. He’s waiting for you at the main hall.”

“Thank you.” Lin Yun then fell into deep thought. Guardian Plum is looking for me? Then, he remembered that Jian Xuanhe had a huge gift for him. Guardian Plum should be summoning him to give the gift. Lin Yun’s figure flashed and he disappeared in the next second.

“Senior Brother Lin!”

“Greetings, Senior Brother Lin!”

“Hello, Senior Brother Lin!” Every disciple he passed by would greet him to express their respect. After all, who didn’t know that Lin Yun rose to fame during the competition and brought honor to the sect?

“Senior Brother Lin is a living legend in the empire. Especially since he grasped the xiantian sword intent before reaching the Violet Palace Realm. No one in the competition can compareto him. I wonder how far he will reach in the future.”

“Yeah. Senior Brother overshadowed the other titled figures. He’s still a hot topic even after so many days.”

“You can’t blame him. After all, which of the previous champions have comparable accomplishments?”

Many disciples looked at Lin Yun with respect and the deacon walking next to Lin Yun was also cautious. The deacon suddenly smiled, “Lin Yun, you must be unaware of this piece of news since you’ve spent the past few days cultivating.

“What is it?” asked Lin Yun curiously.

“Five days from now, Bloomphoenix Princess will ascend the throne and become the first empress in the empire.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Lin Yun suddenly stopped walking as he was taken aback by the news. He looked at the strand of hair coiled around his pinky and fell into deep thought. Princess, just who the hell are you?
