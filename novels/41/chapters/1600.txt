Chapter 1601 - Provocation

When it came to the Heavenly Note Sect and Profound Valley, they had a good relationship with each other. One was proficient in music dao and had a huge background, while the other was proficient in spiritual runes and could forge artifacts.

“That white-dressed lady is the chief disciple of the Heavenly Note Sect, Lin Wan. She grasped the pinnacle noble tune, and her cultivation is in the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. The chief disciple of the Profound Valley’s name is Zhang Yuan, and he has high attainment in spiritual runes. It is rumored that he has reached the eighth-grade saint spiritualist. But he’s capable of creating a ninth-grade saint diagram and grasped thousands of different saint runes.” Mu Xueqin introduced.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Lin Yun scratched his head when he heard that. It had been a long since he used his music dao, he had only stopped at the initial noble tune, so he had a long way to go when compared to the pinnacle noble tune. As for his attainment in spiritual runes, he could barely be considered a saint spiritualist, but he didn’t know how to create saint diagrams.

“They might have a close relationship with our Sword Sect, but we’re competitors in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. We won’t kill each other if we fight, which is a rapport between our three sects. Do keep that in mind if you run into them.” Mu Xueqin continued.

Lin Yun nodded upon hearing that because everyone came to the Ancient Barren Battlefield for interest. Unless one of them was the subsidiary, it was unrealistic for everyone to maintain their alliances before priceless treasures. But it was acceptable for them to hold back and not take each other’s lives if they clashed.

Sweeping his gaze, Lin Yun turned towards another direction. Over there was a group of monks with robust figures, and the veins on their arms were like intertwining dragons, emitting terrifying vitalities. They all looked like living Arhats, and even Lin Yun was surprised by their powerful physiques.

This surprised Lin Yun because Chen Tao obtained his Glazed Treasure Physique by reaching a high level in the Divine Phaseless Art. In the entire Emerald Jade Manor, only he had achieved that.

Although the physiques of those monks were incomparable to Chen Tao, the gap wasn’t far. But they won in quantity, rather than quality. The chief disciple of that party was a robust figure carrying a Buddhism blade with a bizarre design, and he didn’t look like a monk at all.

This contrast shocked Lin Yun, and he sighed, “That person is an expert of the Vajra Monastery, right? His foundation is a little terrifying…”

Nodding her head, Mu Xueqin replied, “The Vajra Monastery is the most mysterious sect in the Ancient Barren Domain. They might be a Buddhism sect, but they can be good or evil. They also have a huge origin because they’re able to maintain being at the top three in the past Ancient Barren Battlefields.”

Mu Xueqin’s tone contained her unhappiness. After all, the Sword Sect and Profound Sky Sect fought ferociously while the Vajra Monastery kept growing for the past few hundred years.

“The one carrying a blade is the chief disciple of the Vajra Monastery, Xuan Feng. But don’t be fooled by his identity as a monk. He’s a Blade Wielder in the Vajra Monastery. He has the authority to slay disciples who violate the rules in the sect, and he can slay demonic cultivators outside. Not only does he have a terrifying physique, his Demon Subduing Blade Technique has reached a terrifying height. In terms of blade techniques alone, he’s no weaker than the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s Xiao Kui.”

“Looks like none of them are pushovers.” Lin Yun smiled with faint fighting spirits blazing within his pupils. This Ancient Barren Domain was a grand event, and anyone who could lead their sects’ disciples in the Ancient Barren Domain wasn’t a pushover.

Right then, lightning bolts streaked across the horizon as a group of people enveloped in flames descended from the sky. When they appeared, they instantly became the center of attention. They’re the disciples of the Thunder Sect.

An hour later, Gu Ruochen finally spoke, “The Profound Sky Sect is here.”

When all the Sword Sect’s disciples heard Gu Ruochen’s voice, their faces sank as they raised their heads and looked in a direction. Under everyone’s gazes, a group of people was streaking across the horizon, emitting a terrifying aura as they landed in the location closest to the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

When they appeared, Lin Yun’s gaze fell on the leaders of the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples. Three people were standing in front of the Profound Sky Sect’s party, emitting a terrifying aura that left many people stunned. They were naturally the top three on the Profound Sky Sect’s Inner Ranking.

They were the most outstanding batch of geniuses amongst the Ancient Barren Domain’s Golden Generation. Just one of them was enough to face the chief disciple of the other sects. Everyone reached the pinnacle of the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and each one could kill fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm cultivators. Everyone in the Ancient Barren Domain had long heard of their legends.

They were like three towering mountains, and no one dared to directly look at them. But the powerful sects’ disciples were gathered over there, especially the chief disciple of their sects.

If they wanted to have a massive harvest in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, the Profound Sky Sect was someone they had to face, and those three were mountains that they had to cross. Typically speaking, this was a threshold no one could pass, and it wasn’t an exaggeration to call it Hell’s Gate.

“The two on the sides are Yan Kong and Liu Xu, ranked second and third. Their strength is pretty much the same, and the strongest is Qin Tian, the one in the middle!” Mu Xueqin said with a grave expression. “Aside from that, it is rumored that the three of them have grasped a unison technique that was personally taught to them by Tian Xuanzi to prevent them from fail in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Even sixth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm experts won’t be able to take their attack head-on.”

Nodding his head, Lin Yun looked at Yan Kong and Liu Yu. One was like a pure flawless moon, while the other was dazzling, like a blazing sun. Anyone could tell the vast difference in their temperaments; their robust dragon origins was their only similarity.

As for the one in the middle, Lin Yun couldn’t find a word to describe this person. But it would be unfathomable if he had to use a word to describe him.

Just this alone was enough to prove that this person wasn’t simple. Liu Xu and Yan Kong could be called the sun and moon, but Qin Tian outshone the two of them. He was like heaven; even the sun and moon had to exist beneath him.

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren!” The Profound Sky Sect’s disciples chanted.

The Profound Sky Sect had always maintained a high profile, chanting that for many years. In the beginning, no one placed them in their eyes. But now, no one dared to laugh at them anymore.

Right then, multiple sects swiftly gathered around the Profound Sky Sect. They were the Flame Phoenix Sect, Myriad Beast Gate, and Flame Dragon Sect…all the big sects in the Ancient Barren Domain, and they weren’t any weaker than the powerful sects in terms of their strength.

They had a long inheritance and were just lacking in their foundations when compared to the powerful sects. They were only second to the powerful sects in the Ancient Barren Domain. When they gathered together, they cupped their hands together, “Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren!”

This was a sign that these big sects had taken sides with the Profound Sky Sect, which made all the sects’ disciple faces change, but they weren’t too surprised. After all, Tian Xuanzi’s prestige had reached an unprecedented height during these recent years.

It was so much so that the powerhouses from other domains had to give Tian Xuanzi some respect, and it was long acknowledged that Tian Xuanzi possessed the strength to confront the Radiant Sword Saint. Not to mention that there were rumors that the Radiant Sword Saint was running out of lifespan. The moment the Radiant Sword Saint dies, Tian Xuanzi would be able to unite the entire Ancient Barren Domain, and these sects were only joining the Profound Sky Sect early.

“My master said that our Profound Sky Sect will take care of you guys in the Ancient Barren Domain. So you guys can return now.” Qin Tian said, waving his hand at the big sects’ disciples.

One must know that the chief disciples of those big sects was at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and they could be considered to be in the Golden Generation. But they were highly respectful when they faced Qin Tian.

“Qin Tian? What’s his relationship with Qin Cang?” Lin Yun asked.

“They’re from the Nether Divinity Clan.” Mu Xueqin replied.

When she spoke, Qin Tian’s gaze fell onto the Sword Sect’s party, and he smiled, “Gu Ruochen and Ye Qingxuan, it has been a long time since we last met!”

Gu Ruochen and Ye Qingxuan’s faces sank when they heard that because Qin Tian’s smile was cold. They suffered quite a loss the last time, especially Ye Qingxuan, who barely survived.

“You’re Lin Yun, right? The Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple who slew the realm son of my Nether Divinity Clan in the Heavenly Path!” Qin Tian smiled with his eyes squinted. “But who gave an ant like you the guts to come to the Ancient Barren Battlefield? With someone of your cultivation? It looks like the Radiant Sword Saint is old to belittle my master…”

His words instantly made the faces of the Sword Sect’s disciples change. Although Qin Tian was wearing a smile, anyone could tell that he was mocking the Radiant Sword Saint for being old. His tone might not contain any killing intent, but his words were arrogant.

“Don’t be so sure about who’s the ant.” Lin Yun winked. “Your words might sound uncouth, but you’re right. My master didn’t place Tian Xuanzi in his eyes.”

His words immediately made Liu Xu and Yan Kong furious as killing intent radiated from their pupils.

“A piece of trash like you dares to be arrogant? It looks like the Sword Sect forgot how our Profound Sky Sect taught you a lesson two decades ago.” Yan Kong said with mockery filled in his pupils.

“Two decades ago, Jian Jingtian was known to be first on the three rankings. But isn’t he imprison in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect like a dog, now? If it’s not for our master’s mercy, he wouldn’t be alive now!” Liu Xu said.

When he mentioned the incident two decades ago, the Sword Sect’s disciples almost completely lost it. Even the corner of Gu Ruochen’s lip twitched, but Lin Yun smiled right then, “My senior brother killed a thousand of your Profound Sky Sect disciples like livestock. In the end, Tian Xuanzi can’t even take my senior brother’s life. The Profound Sky Sword Saint, invincible in the Ancient Barren? I don’t know where you got the guts to say that.”

Lin Yun was smiling, but his pupils radiated a terrifying chill.
