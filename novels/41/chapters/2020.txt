Chapter 2021 - Who'll Feel A Heartache For You!

Lin Yun looked at the Iris Sword Saint with flames blazing within his pupils.

The Iris Sword Saint helplessly smiled, “Your question is really not tough.”

“Senior, is it not convenient to disclose?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s not it. It’s because even I have no idea about the sword that’s supposed to be in the sword box,” the Iris Sword Saint said.

“How is that possible?” Lin Yun was shocked. “The sword box was named after you. So how can you not know about it?”

“Who told you that my name is Iris?” The Iris Sword Saint asked with a smile.

Lin Yun was stunned, and he soon realized what was going on. Iris Sword Saint was his title, like his nickname, Flower Burial.

“Is it something only known to your main body?” Lin Yun asked, but he still wasn’t willing to give up.

The Iris Sword Saint shook his head and said, “I can’t be sure about others, but I’m sure that even my main body doesn’t know much about this sword box. Then again, that was before I was reborn. It has been a hundred thousand years, and I’m unsure if my reincarnation has found the answer.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling disappointed when he heard that. He felt that the sword box might be related to the ‘broken sword’ within his body.

Seeing this, the Iris Sword Saint asked, “I’m not lying to you.”

He turned to Lil’ Purple and said, “Lass, you probably still remember it. You’re the one who previously controlled the Iris Secret Realm, the Extreme Wind, Sinful Fire, Myriad Lightning, Freezing Chill, Solar Lunar, Samsara, and Nirvana.”

“Yeah. You also didn’t see that sword when the seven divine runes were in the Iris Secret Realm.” Lil’ Purple nodded. “I’ve never seen that sword before.”

“Can it be the Emperor Sword?” Lin Yun asked.

Shaking his head, the Iris Sword Saint said, “I don’t think so. The Emperor Sword is one of the ten divine artifacts within the Kunlun Realm, which can be used to slay deities. But the existence of the Iris Sword Box is earlier than that.”

“If I’ve guessed correctly, this sword box should’ve been given to you by the Ancestral Deity. After all, you’re his successor,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Yeah,” the Iris Sword Saint nodded.

Lin Yun squinted his pupils. He was shocked when he looked at the Iris Sword Saint. Although he had his guesses, hearing it from the Iris Sword Saint was shocking.

“So the sword box I’m carrying was forged by that Ancestral Deity?” Lin Yun suddenly felt that the sword box had become heavy.

“You can take it that way,” the Iris Sword Saint smiled.

“Does that mean I’m also his successor?” Lin Yun suddenly became nervous because he heard from Lil’ Purple that the Ancestral Deity was ranked first within the Kunlun Realm.

“No. You can only be considered my successor,” the Iris Sword Saint smiled.

“Senior, when will my friend wake up?” Lin Yun smiled after a brief hesitation, and he pointed at Bai Qingyu. Bai Qingyu was wearing the Celestial Vine Crown and was asleep on the altar.

“Wake up.” The Iris Sword Saint smiled, waving his hand. Bai Qingyu then woke up and her pupils became clear. She seemed able to step into the Quasi-Saint Realm anytime she wanted, and her aura was more refined. She clearly obtained a great benefit from the Udumbara Flower.

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling when he saw this scene, and he couldn’t help feeling that Bai Qingyu was really fortunate. She could probably make a breakthrough to the Quasi-Saint Realm when she returned, and her foundation was stronger than many people in the same generation.

When Bai Qingyu woke up, she saw Lin Yun coming over. She quickly examined his condition and asked, “Big Brother Ye, have you obtained the Udumbara Flower?”

“Senior, I’ll be taking my leave now. But you can’t possibly let me leave empty-handed, right?” Lin Yun smiled.

When he heard that, the Iris Sword Saint couldn’t help wearing a helpless smile, he said, “I’m only a soul fragment, so why are you making it tough for me?”

“I’m not making it tough on you,” Lin Yun replied.

“You can’t bring the seed with you, but it’s fine for you to leave with a few petals.” The Iris Sword Saint was generous and flicked his finger.

The petals scattered on the altar began to gathered togther and absorbed all the saint rain on the ground. When flames ignited on the altar, those flames contained the essence of the divine runes underground. Tribulation lightning didn’t take long to descend, and the floral fragrance also became even more refined under the temperament of lightning.

“Everything is like dream bubbles, and dreams are like thunder…” The sound of scriptures being recited came from the surroundings as a sacred radiance shone. Under the empowerment of the scriptures, the petals gave off a powerful golden radiance while being basked in sacred light.

Seeing this, Lin Yun was amazed because this was alchemy. But the Iris Sword Saint’s alchemy was too shocking.

Bai Qingyu was also shocked while looking at the Iris Sword Saint. She felt that even Saint Lords might not be comparable to this man before her. Right then, a phoenix cry echoed as Lil’ Purple hovered in the air, her hair growing out and becoming silver.

Snowflakes fluttered, and Lil’ Purple suddenly flicked her finger. The crimson and golden runes on her forehead bloomed, and a droplet of blood flew out from her finger, fusing into the pellet. When she was done, she became exhausted and fell from the sky. Lin Yun had quickly come forth to catch her.

“What is he doing?” Lin Yun asked.

Lil’ Purple’s face was pale, and she said, “He’s refining the Samsara Nirvana Pellet. It might not be able to bring someone back to life like the Udumbara Flower’s seed, but it could save the life of someone who failed their Emperor Tribulation. It might even allow the consumer to attempt another breakthrough to the Emperor Realm.”

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that, and he now knew how shocking the Iris Sword Saint’s action was. He watched as the Iris Sword Saint pointed his finger, and the pellet revolved. Lin Yun was shocked that the pellet was in a new world with space isolated from the outside world.

Space and time above the altar collapsed, and the pellet looked like it had traveled through time as it revolved. One circulation was a year, and a thousand years have passed in the blink of an eye. Lin Yun was dazed when he saw this and muttered to himself, “This is nirvana?”

Even a deity might not be comparable to the Iris Sword Saint.

When the pellet released a powerful golden radiance, two types of runes, black and white, were engraved on the pellet's surface.

“Here, take a bottle out.” The Iris Sword Saint received the jade bottle with a smile and used Iris Saint Seal to seal the entire bottle. With that, only two people in the entire world could undo the seal, Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple.

Lin Yun immediately went down on one knee and said, “Lin Yun thanks Senior on behalf of my master.”

But surprisingly, the Iris Sword Saint shook his head and smiled, “You will have your tribulation in the future. If you can’t make it through, you might lose everything. This pellet is yours, but you can decide who you want to give it to.”

“Senior, didn’t you say you can’t see the future?” Lin Yun asked.

The Iris Sword Saint stroked his beard and smiled, “I can’t see through fate, but I can see some karma.”

Lil’ Purple’s cheeks trembled as she looked at the Iris Sword Saint with a pale face. She said, “I’ll keep the Samsara Nirvana Pellet for you.”

“I’ll do it.” Lin Yun shook his head, wanting to reach out to receive the jade bottle.

But Lil’ Purple was one step ahead and snatched the jade bottle. She fiercely looked at Lin Yun, “I said, I’ll keep it for you.”

Lin Yun was stunned when he looked at Lil’ Purple. He didn’t know why Lil' Purple was suddenly so generous.

“Okay.” Lin Yun had no choice but to take a step back.

Lil’ Purple bit her lips with tears welling up in her pupil. She furiously said, “What’s okay about it? Do you think you’re the only one with feelings and will feel heartache for others? Who will feel heartache for you, then?

“So I’ll keep it for you. It contains my divine blood, so don’t dream about touching it.” Lil’ Purple entered the Iris Secret Realm with the jade bottle.

Bai Qingyu kept silent, having no idea why her master became so furious.

“Senior, swordsmen must undergo various tribulations, and no one can avoid it. Will I not be able to make it through that tribulation?” Lin Yun asked.

“Nothing is absolute. As long as fate doesn’t appear, karma is king. It’s hard to sever karma with the sword in your hand,” the Iris Sword Saint smiled.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Lin Yun took a deep breath and cupped his fists together. He said, “No matter what, I’m grateful for what you’ve done for me, Senior.”

The Iris Sword Saint smiled, “It doesn’t matter. I’m only a soul fragment and should do something to help. That lass is petty and can’t contain too many people within her heart. So don’t take it to heart. But if you enter her heart, she’ll do anything to save you, even if she has to pay the price of her life.”

Lin Yun’s face changed, and he asked, “Senior, did you see something?”

“I can’t say anything!” The Iris Sword Saint sighed and waved his hand for them to leave.

After Lin Yun and Bai Qingyu left, the Iris Sword Saint’s soul fragment dissipated like fireworks. When he completely disappeared, the Udumbara Flower bloomed once more and entered the altar.

“Is Master alright?” Bai Qingyu asked.

“Let her sleep for a while,” Lin Yun said.

Lil’ Purple had fallen asleep within the Iris Secret Realm, and Lin Yun didn’t want to bother her.

“Are we going to Six Holy City?”

“Yeah,” Lin Yun nodded. He actually wanted to cultivate here, but a month had passed, and he couldn’t stay any longer.

After they left the Iris Secret Realm, they were shocked by what they saw. A blood ocean had stretched out to a few thousand miles. There was a temporary altar on the ocean and nine Blood Crow Kings. The leader of the nine Blood Crow Kings was an elderly one. Its wings had turned golden, which stood out amongst the other Blood Crow Kings with only silver wings.

Floating on the blood ocean were piles of corpses belonging to Blood Crows.

“Demon, you’re finally out!” The golden-winged Blood Crow King looked at Lin Yun, gritting its teeth.

Lin Yun looked around, and his face became grave. The Blood Crow Tribe had taken everything out just to intercept him here, and the aura coming from the golden-winged Blood Crow King wasn’t any weaker than the Blood Crow Ancestor. This Blood Crow King didn’t step into the saint path by relying on the graves.

“I advise you to leave immediately. Otherwise, I don’t mind butchering the entire Blood Crow Tribe,” Lin Yun said as he released a powerful sword intent. The sword intent he gave off made tens of thousands of Blood Crows tremble in fear as they retreated.

But the golden-winged Blood Crow King sneered, “You can leave, but that lass beside you has to stay behind…”

Since they couldn’t agree, Lin Yun didn’t want to waste his saliva and came to the altar. Aside from the golden-winged Blood Crow King, the other Blood Crow Kings were shocked and stepped back. After all, Lin Yun was too shocking to charge onto the altar.

“What are you trying to do?” A Blood Crow King asked in a trembling voice. “You want to kill the nine of us by yourself?!”

“I’m not alone…” Lin Yun drew his sword, releasing a sword vibration that made the sky change. He wasn’t alone because he still had the Flower Burial Sword. This caught the Blood Crow Kings by surprise before one of them had been severed into two.
