Chapter 1649 - No Luck

Zhang Yuan and Liu Xu both arrived beside Qin Tian. Qin Tian’s face was pale, and it was clear that his injuries weren’t light. Under the impact of Lin Yun’s sword soul, his body was injured, and he even took a strong blow to his soul. Not only did he fail, but he was injured.

“Senior Brother, are you alright?” Liu Xu asked in concern.

“Go back. I’m fine.” Qin Tian coldly said before waving his hand to summon the Golden Dragon Divine Flag.

“Since you guys are here, don’t bother leaving.” The purple diamond mark on Lin Yun’s forehead shone brightly, and his powerful Firmament Sword Intent began to rise under everyone’s shocked gazes.

After a sword vibration echoed from Lin Yun, it turned into a golden beam that soared to the sky, piercing through and splitting the demonic clouds that were in the sky. As an unbelievably powerful sword intent exploded from Lin Yun, the pressure that he gave off made the sky change.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Standing on the Azure Dragon, Lin Yun felt he could make heaven and earth tremble by raising his hand alone. At this moment, he was the heaven, his sword as the dome, and he was one with his sword.

“Heavenly Dome Sword Intent!”

“How is this possible?!”

“Oh my god! It’s really the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent! Lin Yun grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent while in the Dragon Pulse Realm?” Everyone could feel their scalps tingling when they saw the various phenomena, and they couldn’t help exclaiming. Even the holy lands’ disciples were stumped with disbelief radiating from their pupils.

Zhang Yuan and Liu Xu were initially hesitating if they should leave. But when they sensed Lin Yun’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, their faces changed. They could briefly endure before they both threw out a mouthful of blood under the immense pressure and were sent flying away.

They weren’t on the same level, to begin with. So there was no way they could interfere with a battle of this level.

“You think you can defeat me with the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent? That’s impossible!” Qin Tian snorted and started circulating the Golden Dragon Bone.

The next moment, the Golden Dragon Divine Flag in his hand began to blaze as Qin Tian activated its two glory spirits. The Golden Dragon engraved on the flag came to life. Its pupils were forged with two glory spirits. They were the Glorysun and Gloryfire Spirits. When the Golden Dragon opened its eyes wide, it began to clash with Lin Yun’s sword aura.

“Die!” Qin Tian roared, swinging the Golden Dragon Divine Flag around.

The Golden Dragon on the flag breathed out golden dragon flames that instantly dyed the entire sky in gold. Looking from afar, it looked as though the sky was being incinerated.

Looking at the flames in the sky, Lin Yun rode on the Azure Dragon, shifting around in the air and swinging his Flower Burial Sword. Under his attack, the entire region became covered with sword rays and flames.

Countless flames and afterimages exploded, and Lin Yun’s afterimages were incinerated. At this moment, everyone’s gazes were focused on Lin Yun.

“Kill!” Lin Yun leaped down from the Azure Dragon’s head. When he landed on the ground, the sword aura enveloping him was like layers of heaven multiplying on him.

“Great! Come!” Qin Tian laughed and dashed forth. As he swung the Golden Dragon Divine Flag, a golden light flashed that instantly covered the sky.

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren!” Qin Tian’s laughter roared. As the sun and moon revolved around the flag, whenever Qin Tian swung his fan, it would cause heaven and earth to tremble.

Pushing forth, Qin Tian appeared before Lin Yun and thrust his flag. Although Lin Yun used his sword to fend off this attack, he kept retreating under Qin Tian’s assault.

“Hahaha!” Qin Tian laughed with killing intent gathering in his pupils. After he poured his dragon origin into the flag, he thrust the tip forth, facing the Flower Burial Sword head-on.

“Heavenly Dome Sword Intent doesn’t seem so impressive after all. It’s all nothing before absolute strength!” Qin Tian coldly said. “Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, you’re going to lose!”

“Who told you that this is the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent?” Lin Yun said indifferently.

His words made Qin Tian squint his eyes. But before he could react, the Flower Burial Sword in Lin Yun’s hand flew out towards Qin Tian.

“Die!” Qin Tian didn’t think much about it and stabbed the Golden Dragon Divine Flag at Lin Yun’s chest. In Qin Tian’s view, he believed that Lin Yun couldn’t avoid this attack, no matter how profound his movement technique was.

But just when he had that thought, the Flower Burial Sword behind Qin Tian suddenly vibrated and summoned Lin Yun over. Just like that, Lin Yun suddenly disappeared, causing Qin Tian’s attack to miss.

“What’s going on?” Qin Tian was baffled. Before he came to his senses, Lin Yun was suddenly summoned to the Flower Burial Sword, thus appearing behind him.

When Lin Yun grabbed his sword, he became one with the sword. But to others, they only saw Lin Yun sending his sword out with a flick before holding onto his sword again. The only difference was that he had changed his position.

Since Qin Tian couldn’t react in time, Lin Yun’s sword left a bloody wound on his back. When he turned his head back, he could see Lin Yun wielding his sword and looking at him.

“Sword Manipulation!” Lin Yun formed a seal with his left hand before flicking his finger, and the Flower Burial Sword in his right hand flew out.

Qin Tian wanted to send the Flower Burial Sword flying with a wave of his hand, but the Flower Burial Sword reacted as though it was alive and revolved around the flag. When Lin Yun gently raised his right hand, the Flower Burial Sword flew towards Qin Tian’s brow, piercing through the air in its path.

This changed Qin Tian’s face, and he quickly tossed the flag away before retreating.

“Endless Clouds!” Lin Yun stood in the same position and used his fingers to execute the first form of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique.

Sword auras spread out from the Flower Burial Sword that was ten miles away, and the sword instantly unleashed forty-nine sword rays that spread out like a sea of clouds. The intent contained within his sword technique was perfect, and this left everyone dumbfounded. After all, Lin Yun was executing the sword technique by manipulating his sword from afar.

“Pricking Moon!”

“Rising Clouds!”

“Serene Aquasky!”

“Soaring White Clouds!” As Lin Yun’s movement became faster, the Flower Burial Sword in the air moved even faster, surprising everyone.

The countless sword rays dazzled everyone’s eyes as various intents were released from Lin Yun and the Flower Burial Sword. Lin Yun stood in the same spot, dancing like an immortal while the Flower Burial Sword flew under his control.

In such a short moment, Qin Tian was injured by the sword rays. He had never experienced something like this before. There was clearly a sword before him, and he could execute various sword techniques, but he couldn’t find any flaws.

Ten miles away, Lin Yun raised his head to look at the Flower Burial Sword, and the Flower Burial Sword was also looking at him. The next moment, Lin Yun could see himself through the sword. As a power came from the sword, Lin Yun’s body disappeared.

When Lin Yun reappeared, he grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword and became one with his sword. This time, he wasn’t wielding the sword but the other way around.

When Lin Yun grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword, the aura he gave off was like heaven. The immense pressure he gave off sent Qin Tian flying away and throwing out a mouthful of blood. When Qin Tian came to his senses, he blankly looked at Lin Yun, having no idea what was happening.

Lin Yun coldly said, while wielding the Flower Burial Sword, “Qin Tian, I’m not afraid to tell you honestly. I have plenty of ways to kill you, but I want you to admit defeat. The Radiant Sword Saint cannot be humiliated, nor can I!”

“He’s just a dying person. So what if I humiliated him? As for you… Who do you think you are? If you’re not lucky to grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, killing you would be as easy as slaughtering pigs!” Qin Tian said coldly, his lip twitching.

Summoning his flag back, He donned the Golden dragon Armor as the saint’s clone appeared behind him, and his flag began to flutter.

Lin Yun laughed, “Luck? There’s no luck in my journey. I have experienced life and death by coming this far, and I will lose my life if I’m not careful. I’m first on the lower realm’s Draconic Banquet, champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path!

“After coming to the Kunlun Realm, I was first on the Empyrean Ranking and Elysium Core Ranking! Do you think that it’s all luck? It looks like there’s nothing impressive about Tian Xuanzi’s disciple after all!” Lin Yun’s blood boiled, and he executed the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon.

As dazzling sword rays bloomed from Lin Yun’s body, Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura flew out from Lin Yun’s pores and soared to the sky along with his sword aura. The radiance he gave off made the sun and moon pale.

At the same time, Lin Yun’s laughter could be heard, “I’m Flower Burial, burying both flowers and people alike.”

Taking a step forth, Lin Yun unleashed four sword forms, executing the Wind, Fire, Lightning, and Ice Sword Forms.

Lin Yun’s eyes coldly flashed as he spun in mid-air, and the four ancient words landed on Qin Tian. The wind first tore the saint’s clone into pieces before flames incinerated the Golden Dragon. Then, the third sword shattered Qin Tian’s armor, and the last sword forced Qin Tian down on his knees.

“No… No… This is impossible!” Qin Tian had fear reflected in his pupils. He wanted to move, but he was heavily injured, with his constellation destroyed, his meridians broken, and his four limbs covered with wounds.

“Senior Brother lost?” All the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples on the altar were stumped when they saw this scene.

When Lin Yun came before Qin Tian, he looked at him, kneeling on the ground without any expression on his face.

“You…”

But just when Qin Tian opened his mouth, Lin Yun swung his sword and severed one of Qin Tian’s arms. He then looked at Qin Tian and coldly said, “This sword is to tell you that the Radiant Sword Saint cannot be humiliated!”

“ARGGGHHH!” Qin Tian screamed out from the pain, his face swiftly becoming pale.

But in the next moment, Lin Yun severed his other arm and said, “This sword was for the blood feud two decades ago.

“This sword is to tell you that there isn’t a single strand of luck in my journey after coming this far!”

Before Qin Tian could scream, Lin Yun swung his sword again and severed Qin Tian’s head.
