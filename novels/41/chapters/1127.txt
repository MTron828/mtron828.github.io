Chapter 1128 - Full Moon

It didn’t take long for all of the core disciples to arrive at the corpses of the three major sects. Even Patriach Qiu arrived on the scene with empyreans of the Qiu Clan.

When Flower Burial was stabbed in the heart by Leng Aoran, Yan Teng was the first to react. He rushed over with disciples of the three major sects. So by the time everyone noticed that there was something wrong with the situation, they charged over.

After all, their lives were saved by Flower Burial. However, the actions of Yan Teng’s group showed that they wanted to take advantage of Flower Burial. Flower Burial would have been heavily injured since he took a sword to the heart, and there was no way Yan Teng could let such an opportunity go.

The outcome was different than what everyone imagined. Instead of Yan Teng fighting Flower Burial, there was a pile of corpses. When they found the body of Yan Teng, they saw that he was tortured to death. Despite his tragic outcome, no one felt pity for him.

In contrast, they were rejoicing on the inside. Yan Teng had completely humiliated the sects by bowing to Thunderclap Sword Demon and promising to kill all the disciples present. How could they possibly forgive him?

When they raised their heads, they saw Flower Burial flying away while playing music that resonated with heaven and earth. It was a sad and lonely song.

Lin Yun flew far away before he reached the border of Flow Light Island. When he landed on a rock, he looked at the barren ocean, but he didn’t stop playing the flute. Half an incense’s time later, a white figure reappeared with Lil’ Red in her embrace.

Looking at Lil’ Purple’s arrival, Lin Yun finally lowered his flute and looked at her. Lil’ Purple’s face became red from his gaze and replied, “I lost him.”

“You lost him?” Lin Yun was surprised to hear that because he was sure that Leng Aoran was heavily injured and on his last breath. Although Lil’ Purple couldn’t put up a fight, it shouldn’t be an issue for Lil’ Red to deal with him.

“He’s heavily injured, but he ran to somewhere bizarre. The entire ocean is enveloped in a demonic light that looks weird, so I came back first,” replied Lil’ Purple.

“The Demon Domain!” Lin Yun suddenly knew what the place was after listening to Lil’ Purple’s explanation. If that was really the case, then it would be hard for them to chase after him.

When the golden era ended many years ago, Kunlun Realm underwent a long period of chaos enveloped in darkness. It was a dark era full of disaster and chaos.

The ending of that chaotic aura gave birth to tens of thousands of saint clans that took control of the situation. Then, the saints fought each other with countless saints and sects falling. However, it still couldn’t compare to the dark era.

Three millennia ago, nine emperors appeared and suppressed everyone, re-establishing the Divine Dragon Empire and rule of Kunlun Realm. Only then did Kunlun Realm calm down on the surface.

The Divine Dragon Empire then went on to set up manors and counties that they controlled. It allowed Kunlun Realm to flourish once again while cultivation reached an unprecedented height that was slowly closing in on the golden era.

All of this was thanks to the order established by the Divine Dragon Empire. However, there were also territories that the Divine Dragon Empire didn’t have control over, such as remote regions like the Profound Azure Manor. Although there were manor lords and county lords here, the territory was basically controlled by various sects.

The Demon Domain belonged to the Heartless Demon Emperor of the nine emperors. He was the emperor of all demons and reigned over all the demonic forces. The Demon Domain amounted to a ninth of the entire Kunlun Realm as it had many demonic forces. Since it was where demonic forces were gathered, it naturally gained the name Demon Domain.

The Demon Domain was the residence of the demonic emperor, but there were other domains that were part of the demonic forces. Those domains were called the Lesser Demon Domains.

The Demon Domain was a genuine boundless territory that occupied a vast land in Kunlun Realm. The Lesser Demon Domain was much smaller as it was occupied by simple demonic cultivators. But no one really paid any mind to the Lesser Demon Domains.

After all, light and darkness coexisted. The Lesser Demon Domain was a gathering for demonic cultivators and also a black market that many righteous sects would use to purchase some resources. So the Demon Domains had a reason to exist.

This was the explanation from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s books and Luo Hua. Naturally, Luo Hua was a direct descendant of a saint clan with information that exceeded anything Lin Yun could imagine.

“10,000 saints and nine emperors. Did that many things happen during the time I was asleep?” Lil’ Purple wore a complex expression with disdain on her face, “Hmph, since when is the title of an emperor so easily obtained? I’ll annihilate all of them when I restore my strength!”

“You’re making things difficult for me.” Lin Yun smiled.

The nine emperors were the Buddha Emperor, Demonic Emperor, Demon Emperor, Sword Emperor, The Empress, Blade Emperor, Lightning Emperor, White Emperor, and Southern Emperor. The nine emperors were legendary figures that hadn’t appeared in public for a long time. There were even rumors that they were already dead.

Even if Lil’ Purple had sufficient strength, she wouldn’t be able to find the emperors. Lil’ Purple pouted, “Hmph, you have no idea of my ability!”

Lin Yun smiled when he heard that. But just when he was about to speak, he threw up a mouthful of blood. Seeing this, Lil’ Purple panicked and asked, “Hey, you’re not really going to die, right?”

“It doesn’t matter,” replied Lin Yun while wiping the blood off. After all, he had taken a sword to his heart, and he would’ve died if he didn’t have the mask, Silver Moon. His injuries weren’t serious, but he forcibly made a move against the disciples of the three sects earlier that worsened his injuries.

“Don’t you have more Nirvana Pellets? Why don’t you take another one?” Lil’ Purple urged.

Lin Yun rolled his eyes when he heard that. “Are Nirvana Pellets that common? They’re a divine elixir that can revive someone as long as they have one breath left.”

It was even effective even in the Empyrean Realm. Lin Yun only had six of them left, so he would naturally cherish them preciously. He already used one of the pellets two days ago, but that’s cause he had no other choice

“Hmph, why are you treating it as a treasure? Back then, one breath from me was a hundred times more precious than a Nirvana Pellet!” Lil’ Purple replied in disdain after seeing what a miser Lin Yun was.

“Since you can do that, why don’t you show me right now?” Lin Yun smiled.

“This empress…!” Lil’ Purple’s face turned red, “I can’t do that right now.”

Lin Yun smiled and chuckled because he was used to Lil’ Purple boasting.

Taking out several Blood Flame Pellets, Lin Yun sat down to recover.

“Hehe, let me play with these for a bit.” Lil’ Purple took the mask off of Lin Yun’s face and took his jade flute. Lin Yun was about to stop her, but he didn’t.

“Hehe, they’re mine now! Lil’ Red, let’s go!” Lil’ Purple laughed before she patted Lil’ Red on the head. After Lil’ Red transformed into its warhorse form, it began to gallop on the ocean.

When Lil’ Purple put on the mask, her hair and dress turned silver. Then, she played the flute while waves rose on the ocean.

“This lass…” Lin Yun wore a smile. Lil’ Purple had followed him to kill many demonic cultivators in the past month, so he wanted her to have some fun. But after staying with Lil’ Red for so long, she had also become a little money hungry.

Fortunately, she was adorable and would be an adorable thief if she became one. Lin Yun smiled and then focused on the medicinal effect of the Bloodflame Pellet bursting out. As he recovered, he recalled his fight with Thunderclap Sword Demon.

He had to admit that his cultivation was really holding him back. If it wasn’t for his flute, he wouldn’t even last more than ten moves against a Galaxy Stage expert. Then again, wielding the flute as a sword wasn’t invincible either because it relied on Lin Yun’s sword intent. Plus, Lin Yun reached a bottleneck in the dao of music.

Thinking back on his fight, Lin Yun realized that there were a lot of flaws in the Dancing Indigo Phoenix and Iris Sword Sutra. Otherwise, Thunderclap Sword Demon wouldn’t have gotten close to him. He began to wonder if his Dustlight Sword Art could be his strongest means. After all, the Dancing Indigo Phoenix was created by the Iris Sword Saint while the Dustlight Sword Art was entirely comprehended by himself.

In the end, Lin Yun had a lot of insights from his battle. When he opened his eyes again, he had recovered from a majority of his injuries. Simultaneously, Lil’ Purple had returned. He could hear her flute music that was extremely pure like it was the music of the celestials.

Lin Yun was surprised because the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute seemed to be a lot stronger in Lil’ Purple’s hands. Wearing the silver mask, Lil’ Purple asked, “Hehe! Lin Yun, you’re awake? Am I beautiful?”

“Give it back.” Lin Yun reached out.

“Hmph, what a miser.” Lil’ Purple pouted seeing that Lin Yun wasn’t going to praise her.

“Here, have it back!” Lil’ Purple got off of Lil’ Red and handed the mask and flute back.

Holding onto the flute, Lin Yun pondered briefly before he said, “Lil’ Purple, you’ve helped me with the arrays previously, so you must be versed in spiritual runes too, right?”

“Of course! Saint Spiritualists are divided into nine grades, and above that is the Heavenly Spiritualist. The Heavenly Spiritualist only has three grades, and the difference between each grade is even bigger than the nine grades in the Saint Spiritualist. I’m a Divine Spiritualist, which is even stronger than Heavenly Spiritualists. So what do you think?” Lil’ purple replied.

Hearing that, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up with praise, “Impressive. No wonder you’re the Heavenly Slaughter Empress!”

“Hmph! Don’t think that I haven’t realized it. You praise me when you need my help, but you call me Lil’ Purple when you don’t need me. I don’t want to talk to you!” Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes.

“Really?” asked Lin Yun.

“Yeah! You only praised me when I helped you find the painting in the Sword Saint Mountain, but you called me Lil’ Purple right after that!” Lil’ Purple said with her cheeks puffed up.

Now that Lin Yun thought about it again, his actions put him in an awkward situation.

“Also, you have to recite my entire title to make it sound inspiring! I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!” Lil’ Purple said seriously.

“Actually, you were pretty when you wore the mask earlier,” smiled Lin Yun. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Hmph!” Lil’ Purple snorted despite rejoicing inwardly.

“So how much do you still know about spiritual runes?” Lin Yun asked.

When Lil’ Purple heard that, her face turned red. She pinched her fingers together, leaving a gap between her fingers and said, “Just a little, little bit.”

“That’s still impressive,” replied Lin Yun. By the gap of her fingers, Lin Yun felt that she still had a tenth of her original strength.

“A little less than that.” Lil’ Purple pinched her fingers even smaller and only revealed a tiny gap.

When Lin Yun heard that he became suspicious and asked, “Are you sure about that?”

Hearing that, Lil’ Purple’s face turned even redder as she revealed a millimeter gap between her fingers, “Roughly about this much.”

Lin Yun couldn’t believe what he was seeing, it was basically nothing. Looking at Lil’ Purple’s embarrassed face, Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling, “My empress, you’re really adorable.”

“Hmph, I’m not adorable!” Lil’ Purple pouted her lips.

Then again, Lin Yun thought it would be fine because Lil’ Purple grasped two complete divine runes, her own and one from the Azure Dragon King’s true bone.

“Follow me to the Demon Domain,” said Lin Yun.

Hearing that, Lil’ Purple’s eyes shone brightly, “You’re really going to go after Thunderclap Sword Demon?”

“How can I let him go? If I don’t kill him, I won’t be able to obtain any True Dragon Saint Liquid from the old geezer, not to mention that he’s a disciple of the Profound Sky Sect and might know some of their secrets,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Then when are we heading over?” Lil’ Purple became excited when she heard that they would be going to the Demon Domain.

Raising his head, Lin Yun looked at the faintly visible crescent moon. A long time later, he replied, “The next full moon!”
