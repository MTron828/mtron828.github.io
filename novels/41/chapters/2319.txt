Chapter 2320 - Blood Mist Swamp, Sovereign Monument

“We apologize for being disrespectful earlier.” Chang Jun and Xi Ruo said with stern faces as they reluctantly apologized.

“Hmph.” Ji Zixi snorted and turned her head to the side, ignoring the two.

Lin Yun briefly looked at Wu Yuhua before nodding lightly.

“It doesn’t matter if they’re wanderers or cultivators from the Azure Cloud Realm. But the Heavenly Sword Pavilion doesn’t stop anyone from joining us as long as they’re not demonic cultivators,” Lin Jiangxian said, while Chang Jun and Xi Ruo heaved a sigh in relief as they nodded in agreement. She turned to Lin Yun and Ji Zixi and said, “The two of you can come to the Blood Mist Swamp with Wu Yuhua.”

The Blood Mist Swamp? Lin Yun was stumped because he didn’t know what it was, but he nodded.

“Don’t worry about it. The Heavenly Sword Pavilion will offer support as long as you guys aren’t demonic cultivators. I’ll scout the path, so you guys can stay here for now,” Lin Jiangxian said. She was decisive and led a group out of the camp after she resolved this situation.

“Brother Lin, come with me. I’ll arrange a tent for you two,” Wu Yuhua smiled as he led Lin Yun and Ji Zixi to another tent.

When Lin Jiangxian left, Chang Jun and Xi Ruo’s faces became ugly as everyone gathered around them. Anyone could tell that Xi Ruo was probably popular in the Heavenly Sword Pavilion due to her appearance.

“What’s there to be proud of? Since she’s covering herself so tightly, she must be ugly,” Xi Ruo furiously said, looking at Ji Zixi’s back figure. When people came over to console them, Xi Ruo’s mood slightly improved.

“Senior Brother, we can’t let this matter rest so easily!” Xi Ruo looked at Chang Jun.

Chang Jun calmly replied, “We naturally can’t let it rest so easily, but the chief has already noticed them. So we can only bear with it for now.”

A trace of coldness flashed in his eyes as he recalled the humiliation he just suffered. He continued, “It’s fine if they’re somewhat capable, but they’re just a couple of barbarians.”

On the other side, Wu Yuhua smiled, “Senior Sister Lin is the chief disciple, and we often call her Chief. She’s strong and is famous in the Azure Cloud Realm for her Heavenly King Sword.”

Lin Yun nodded, “Indeed, she’s truly remarkable.”

“Our chief is only thirty-five this year and has already grasped the Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent. She’s the strongest genius of the Azure Cloud Realm in the past ten thousand years. If it weren’t for her unwillingness, she would’ve gone to the headquarters long ago.” Wu Yuhua was filled with praise the moment he mentioned Lin Jiangxian.

Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent? The strongest genius of the past ten thousand years? Ji Zixi merely looked at Lin Yun with a smile, but said nothing.

“Oh, what’s the Blood Mist Swamp?” Lin Yun asked.

“There are many ancient ruins in this region, and the Blood Mist Swamp is one of them. In the depths of it, there’s a Sovereign Monument. Comprehending it can allow one to refine the saint daos of Sovereign Daos. If you’re fortunate, it can even produce a Life Dao Fruit. The Sovereign Monument only appears once every five thousand years, and we’re right in time for it. So Senior Sister Lin naturally won’t miss it. But the journey isn’t safe, and you guys can save a lot of trouble by following the Heavenly Sword Pavilion,” Wu Yuhua explained.

Lin Yun immediately had a thought after hearing that.

“Sovereign Daos? Doesn’t that mean that one can also comprehend Sword Dao?” Ji Zixi asked.

“Exactly why I brought you guys here. Just eating the meat of demonic beasts can’t allow you to increase the saint daos of your Sovereign Dao,” Wu Yuhua smiled.

“Thank you, Big Brother Wu!” Ji Zixi smiled. She was happy on Lin Yun’s behalf.

“You have a sweet mouth,” Wu Yuhua laughed as he pointed at the tent in front. He handed two medals over and said, “This is your tent, and no one will disturb you two. Your privacy will be protected. Don’t underestimate the tent; it might look small from the outside, but it's much larger inside. It's like a simple secret realm that can be folded away when necessary.”

Once Lin Yun and Ji Zixi entered the tent, they discovered it was a secret realm for cultivation inside. It was smaller than the Iris Secret Realm, but it was sufficient. There was even a spiritual vein and an area meant for practicing martial techniques.

“Big Brother Wu is pretty good to us,” Ji Zixi said.

“He’s a good person,” Lin Yun smiled.

“What do you plan on doing about those two?” Ji Zixi asked.

"We'll leave them alone for now and focus on our cultivation," Lin Yun said calmly.

In his view, even Lin Jiangxian, whom they held in such high regard, was just ordinary. So, Chang Jun and Xi Ruo were even more insignificant. If they annoyed him, he wouldn’t mind slapping them to death.

“Okay,” Ji Zixi said and became quiet.

Two hours later, Lin Yun breathed after cultivating the two sword canons. He has reached the ninth stage in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, while he only reached the sixth stage with the Great Profound Sword Canon. He naturally had to go to the Sovereign Monument in the Blood Mist Swamp since his cultivation was temporarily stalled.

A brief moment later, Lin Yun soon made up his mind. He clasped his hands together and three thousand ribbons flew out as he formed the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal. He bit on his finger, and a ribbon flew over. He was using his blood as ink to write on the ribbon, and his dragon’s blood was boiling.

After working tirelessly on it for a long time, it eventually alarmed Ji Zixi, who was cultivating. Ji Zixi approached with curiosity, and asked, “Lin Big Brother, what are you doing?"

“I’m drawing a divine rune,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Drawing a divine rune?” Ji Zixi was puzzled.

“To be precise, I’m inscribing my Azure Dragon Divine Rune on it, which is condensed with sword intent,” Lin Yun smiled. “I have read countless ancient martial techniques, and they mainly inscribe spiritual or saint runes on phenomena, but I couldn't do that in the past. So I’m trying it now.”

He couldn’t inscribe a divine rune since he wasn’t a Divine Spiritualist, but the Azure Dragon Divine Rune was born from his Azure Dragon Divine Physique. So he was trying to see if it would work.

“I see… Let me help out as well,” Ji Zixi smiled.

“What can you do to help? Just watch by the side,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Why can’t I help?” Ji Zixi asked furiously. “The Azure Dragon represents Yang in the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal, and I can help you complement it.”

Lin Yun was stunned and smiled, “You have the Phoenix Divine Rune?”

“That’s right!” Ji Zixi smiled.

“You’ve really hidden yourself deeply. Alright, you can help me with it.” Lin Yun created nine thousand ribbons, but any more would be meaningless. Since Ji Zixi could help him, he planned on having three thousand Azure Dragon Divine Runes, three thousand Phoenix Divine Runes, and three thousand Sword Divine Runes if there’s an opportunity in the future.

They worked tirelessly together, since inscribing divine runes was tedious, but Ji Zixi was surprisingly passionate. Lin Yun asked her to take a break multiple times, but she refused.

“Big Brother Lin, aren’t you going to the Sovereign Monument? I couldn’t help you in the Azure Abyssal Wolf Valley, so you can just go ahead without me since this is a rare opportunity,” Ji Zixi said.

Her actions touched Lin Yun. This further made him determined that he had to protect her well in the Heavenly Barren Realm. Once they were done inscribing divine runes five days later, they rested for a few days before they saw Wu Yuhua. Lin Jiangxian had returned.

“The Heavenly Barren Realm opens once every thousand years, and the terrain would change during this time. So even the maps aren’t accurate, and we must explore the region,” Wu Yuhua explained before Lin Yun could speak.

“Brother Lin, your complexion doesn’t look well. What have you been doing for the past few days?” Wu Yuhua asked.

Inscribing divine runes would exhaust vitality, and Lin Yun still hadn’t fully recovered. But just when Lin Yun was about to speak, Wu Yuhua smiled, “I know. But you should exercise restraints sometimes.”

Lin Yun opened his mouth and couldn’t say anything. On the other hand, this made Ji Zixi feel bashful as she lowered her head.

Wu Yuhua smiled, “Let’s go and meet the chief. We’ll set off today.”

Along the way, the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples packed the tents. Lin Jiangxian stood in an auspicious spot, and was giving out an order once the tents were packed, “Let’s go!”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples stood at the front while everyone relied on Lin Jiangxian’s help to reach the Blood Mist Swamp. The journey was dangerous because they would run into demonic cultivators, as well as demonic beasts. Several times, the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples couldn’t hold their ground, and Lin Jiangxian had to make a move.

But Lin Yun never saw Lin Jiangxian making over three moves since she would usually resolve the trouble in one. Her Sword Dao had at least twenty thousand saint daos, which alarmed Lin Yun. He knew that he had underestimated Lin Jiangxian when he saw this.

Seven days later, a swamp enveloped in crimson mist appeared before them. Lin Jiangxian stopped and turned around, “We’re here. The Heavenly Sword Pavilion won’t be able to protect you guys any longer, and I’m sorry about it.”

“Chief Lin, we’re already grateful, not to mention that we’re not entirely here for the Sovereign Monument. We’re satisfied if we can look around at the edge of the Blood Mist Swamp.”

"Thank you for your protection throughout the journey!"

“"Thank you for your protection throughout the journey!"”

The Blood Mist Swamp was massive, with countless ruins. So, they would have some harvest even if they didn’t go deep into the swamp. Everyone dispersed after bidding their farewells.

Very quickly, there were only dozens of people from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion.

Lin Jiangxian instructed, “There’s still a month until the appearance of the Sovereign Monument. Seven of you will form a group and aid each other when there’s danger. We’ll gather again when the Sovereign Monument appears.”

Wu Yuhua invited Lin Yun and Ji Zixi when everyone began to form a group because, aside from Wu Yuhua, Lin Yun and Ji Zixi weren’t welcomed by the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples. This naturally made Chang Jun and Xi Ruo sneer from the side as they watched.

Lin Yun knew that Chang Jun and Xi Ruo probably spoke badly about them in this period. He rejected Wu Yuhua’s rejection with a firm attitude, “There's no need. I will look around with Zixi for now. We can join up after the Sovereign Monument appears.”

Lin Jiangxian appeared and gave Lin Yun a token. She said, “Take out this medal if you run into danger, and most demonic cultivators will give you some face. You can crush it if you run into danger, and I will receive the news.”

The other Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples were calm while Xi Ruo rolled her eyes and muttered to herself. A hundred thousand years have passed, and there wasn’t any grace left from back then.

“Thank you, Lady Lin,” Lin Yun smiled. Lin Jiangxian’s actions won his goodwill.

Lin Jiangxian continued, “It’s hard to cultivate saint dao in the Kunlun Realm. You can just look around for some treasures at the border of the Blood Mist Swamp. There’s no need to risk your life because of them. But you have to return for the Sovereign Monument.”
