Chapter 1343 - Karma

Lin Yun could naturally sense that the stone tablet was extraordinary and seemed to be related to the Divine Sunchasing Art without Lil’ Purple’s reminder. But he didn’t sense that this was a divine bone of the golden crow.

He could tell that the stone tablet was extraordinary, and it might be the greatest opportunity, aside from the Great Saint Origin, just as the monk had said.

Su Ziyao and Ye Ziling’s movements were quick and had blocked off Cang Yun’s path of retreat the moment he stowed the stone tablet. They all knew that Cang Yun was fast, and they couldn’t afford to be careless.

Cang Yun’s face changed when he saw this situation because he knew that he might really be caught here. But he still kept his composure and raised his brow with a smile. “Can’t bear to part with me so soon? I’ve yet to renounce my status as a monk, so I can’t satisfy the two of you, even if you guys make me stay.”

His words were directed at Su Ziyao and Ye Ziling, looking at them with a wretched gaze. But Su Ziyao and Ye Ziling simply ignored him because they knew that he was trying to make them show a flaw. This made Cang Yun exclaim how terrifying women were.

But he ultimately decided to charge through and a golden light shone from his body. With a laugh, he pushed his palm out, “Sorry about this, ladies!”

His palm shone with golden light and even emitted a holy aura that manifested into a gigantic palm, looking like a buddha’s palm. The center of the palm had a revolving ‘卍’ and emitted nine golden rings that allowed the power of this palm to grow even more.

Ye Ziling and Su Ziyao didn’t dare to be careless and swung their swords, easily destroying the palm. This made the two women surprised before they noticed that this was a fake attack from the monk, “Mhm?”

“Hehe, I’m over here!” When everyone turned their attention to where the voice came from, they noticed that Cang Yun had taken advantage of when everyone’s attention was captivated by his attack to bolt in Lin Yun’s direction. He had decided to make a break for it from Lin Yun’s side.

Looking at Lin Yun, Cang Yun smiled. “Don’t think I don’t know. You’re not as strong as others say, and you can only rely on women. Let this daddy show you how to be a man!”

He was arrogant and didn’t place Lin Yun in his eyes at all because his eyes were filled with disdain. Lin Yun merely tilted to the side and opened a path while Cang Yun turned into a golden light and bolted away, causing Su Ziyao and Ye Ziling’s faces to change.

“This daddy will be taking his leave first!” While everyone was baffled, a burst of laughter resounded. When Su Ziyao and Ye Ziling directed their eyes over, their faces changed because they were fooled by Cang Yun once more.

“You should stay behind!” Lin Yun was prepared and raised his head. Spreading his palm out, he executed the Azure Dragon Grasp. When Lin Yun slammed his palm down, Cang Yun was smacked by his palm and threw out a mouthful of blood when he fell to the ground.

“Y-You… how did you find me?!” Cang Yun was surprised because it made no sense. But Lin Yun didn’t explain it to him. He could sense that Cang Yun had a special technique that could conceal his aura and hide in the gap between space. But this ability shouldn’t be from Cang Yun but the tattered monk clothes he was wearing.

If Lin Yun hadn’t grasped the firmament sword intent and had a keen sense when it came to auras, he might have been fooled by Cang Yun. Based on Cang Yun’s personality, he would definitely mock him after he managed to fool Lin Yun. Cang Yun might be reckless when provoking people, but he had a lot of trump cards, and not just anyone could deal with him.

“Hand over the stone tablet or you won’t be leaving. When Nangong Ze and the others catch up, your outcome will only become even more miserable,” said Lin Yun.

“Lin Yun, don’t force me to destroy this stone tablet. Worse comes to worst, I’ll just destroy this stone tablet!” Cang Yun said before he turned back with fear in his eyes. He had already greatly offended the other fated transcendents, especially Nangong Ze, who definitely wouldn’t let him go so easily.

“I’m not as arrogant as you.” Lin Yun helplessly smiled.

“Hmph, it’s good that you acknowledge that. You’ll be killed by Qin Cang sooner or later, so you’re just a dead man walking.” Cang Yun snorted while he looked around. Clearly, he was trying to find a way to escape.

“Hehe, this monk is really adorable. I’m afraid he doesn’t even know what that stone tablet is. Lin Yun, don’t worry about him and let him try destroying it. It’ll be weird if he can destroy it, so just give him a beating!” Lil’ Purple smiled from the sword box.

“Take your pick. Hand over the stone tablet or go back to where you come from,” said Lin Yun.

Cang Yun was anxious and couldn’t help turning around while taking a few glances. He knew he was thoroughly doomed today and couldn’t help slapping himself. He had already left, so why did he have to return and provoke Flower Burial along with his women? But he also wasn’t willing to just hand the stone tablet over.

“I won’t take advantage of you. Hand the stone tablet over and I’ll promise you one thing. What do you want?” Lin Yun smiled.

“I want your Dragon Clan’s body-refining technique. Are you willing to give it to me?” Cang Yun rolled his eyes.

Lin Yun briefly pondered before he said, “Sure. But you don’t have a dragon bone nor have you grasped the Azure Dragon’s dao. So even if I give it to you, you might not be able to reach my height.”

Lin Yun also didn’t want to fool Cang Yun because that stone tablet was worthy of the Azure Dragon Saint Art. But the Azure Dragon Saint Art wasn’t strong by itself. The essence laid in the dragon bone given by the Azure Dragon Lord.

As for Lin Yun, he naturally had his own opportunities that he could bring it to this level. So it wouldn’t be easy for others to reach his level. He had obtained the Blood Flame Saint Rune, refined the Dragon Blood Fruit, bestowed it with Lil’ Purple’s Phoenix Blood, acquired myriads of Divine Dragon Aura, and also received the Dragon Saint Pellet.

All of that had factored in and was the reason why he could reach this level. Cang Yun’s eyes flickered and immediately made a decision after listening to Lin Yun’s words. He smiled. “You don’t have to care about that. When you’re killed by Qin Cang, I can just take the dragon runes from you.”

Lin Yun was speechless because he knew that Cang Yun still didn’t believe him. But since Cang Yun insisted on it, then there was naturally no need for him to try and persuade him. When Cang Yun realizes that he made the wrong choice in the future, it would still be a choice that Cang Yun made.

Taking a step forth, Lin Yun was already before Cang Yun before the latter could react. This made Cang Yun panic and was shocked by Lin Yun’s speed. “W-W-What are you trying to do…?”

But before he could even react, Lin Yun reached out and tapped Cang Yun’s forehead. In the next second, boundless information began to pour into Cang Yun’s mind. It was the body-refining technique given to him by the Azure Dragon Lord, and Lin Yun didn’t hold back any reservation in transmitting it to Cang Yun. Then again, Cang Yun would have to depend on his fortune to see how high he could bring it.

Cang Yun was first shocked before he rejoiced. When he opened his eyes, he laughed, “Hahaha! You can have this broken tablet!”

He knew that the stone tablet had a huge origin, but it had nothing to do with him because he couldn’t even recognize those words on it. Perhaps it might be treated as a treasure by those elders from his sect and they might even create an ancient martial technique from it. But it would have nothing to do with him at that time.

On the other hand, the Azure Dragon Saint Art was a body-refining technique that could be comparable to the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art, and he could tell how powerful it was. As for what Lin Yun said, it just sounded like excuses to him and he naturally wouldn’t fall for it.

Cang Yun smiled. “Don’t come and look for me if you can’t understand the ancient runes on it. But it doesn’t matter anyway since you’ll be killed by Qin Cang, sooner or later. When you’re dead, I can snatch your dragon runes and the stone tablet.”

Looking at the stone tablet, Lin Yun could feel his heart throbbing and this all felt too unreal. When the stone tablet fell into his hand, Lin Yun could sense a reaction from the Azure Dragon Seal within his body, and a pair of golden wings appeared behind him and emitted a dazzling golden light.

When Cang Yun saw this scene, he was terrified to the point that he took several steps back with his face changed. “Are you going to go against your words? It’s already too late. Your stupidity has nothing to do with me.”

Su Ziyao and Ye Ziling were surprised and wondered if Lin Yun suffered a loss, but Cang Yun didn’t seem to be acting.

Lin Yun stowed the pair of wings back into his body and smiled. “Help me with something.”

“Who the hell do you think you are, and why should I listen to you? You think you can give orders to others just because you’re the strongest geniuses on the Heavenly Path?” Cang Yun looked at Lin Yun with disdain. He might have tricked Lin Yun, but he had relied on his own ability to do it.

“I’ll give you a saint elixir as the price for your help,” smiled Lin Yun.

The disdain immediately disappeared on Cang Yun’s face and his eyes nearly fell out of his eye sockets. Rubbing his head, he wore a devilish smile. “Hehe, boss. What orders do you have? I promise that I’ll get it done perfectly.”

“Lure those people pursuing you away,” said Lin Yun and tossed the worst saint elixir to Cang Yun.

“Hehe, sure! I’ll make sure to get it done!” Cang Yun chuckled with his eyes lighting up. “You’re really generous, and I really don’t want to see you get killed by Qin Cang now.”

At the same time, he felt that a fool like Lin Yun was rare. Taking the saint elixir from Lin Yun, Cang Yun turned around and ran, leading Nangong Ze and the others in another direction.

“Lin Yun, did you really suffer a loss?” Su Ziyao asked. If Lin Yun was really fooled by the monk, then she would definitely make him pay the price when she gets out.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Nope.” Lin Yun smiled. He then tossed the stone tablet into the sword box before he replied, “He’ll definitely come and look for me in the future, but there’s no way I’ll spit it out now that it’s mine.”

“Then, why did you give him a saint elixir?” Ye Ziling asked.

“I want to go after the Great Saint Origin, and I don’t want a bunch of people following me,” said Lin Yun calmly.

“Hahaha! This is a huge bargain! That baldie is a fool!” Lil’ Purple laughed in the sword box as she examined the stone tablet in excitement. “If you’re lucky, the Elysium Core Realm version of the Divine Sunchasing Art and the origin saint rune can be found inside! So much so that it might be an origin divine rune instead of a saint rune! Furthermore, this stone tablet is a divine bone from the golden crow, and there are still restrictions inside!”
