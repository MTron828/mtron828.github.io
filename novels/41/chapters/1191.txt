Chapter 1192 - Gongsun Yan

As Lin Yun and Feng Xingyang faced each other on the stage. Their battle was a result of the grudge between Lin Yun and Feng Xiaoyu. After all, the arrogance of Lin Yun had been spreading through the city like wildfire over the past few days.

Although Lin Yun didn’t want to stay at the Sword Assembly, the Feng Clan stopped him from leaving. They thought that he was an easy target that could be dealt with through the Sword Assembly.

So how could anyone expect Lin Yun to beat Zhao Yan? His win was proving the Feng Clan wrong. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Lin Yun even humiliated Feng Xingyang by forcing the latter to bet with ten saint swords. Now, it was a battle between Lin Yun and the prestige of the Feng Clan.

If Feng Xingyang was really defeated by one sword, then the Feng Clan would become a laughingstock. Feng Xiaoyu would take the strongest hit to her reputation and no one would pay attention to her anymore.

Feng Xingyang restricted his cultivation in the Heavenly Soul Realm and took a deep breath. His expression was grave because he didn’t dare to be careless. In the next second, a boundless sword intent exploded out of his body while his hair fluttered violently in the wind.

He was considered a genius in the sword since he could grasp the greater mastery of sky sword intent in the Empyrean Realm. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be accepted into the Hidden Sword Manor. In terms of talent, he wasn’t inferior to Zhao Yan. However, his foundation wasn’t as strong.

The Hidden Sword Manor was a sacred ground for swordsmen, and not many sects could compete with them aside from powerful sects.

When Feng Xingyang’s sword aura reached the limit, he took a step forward and drew his sword. In the next second, nine afterimages appeared around Lin Yun that were swinging their swords. Furthermore, the location of the nine afterimages wasn’t simple as the sword rays all flickered with different spiritual runes.

There were nine different sword attacks that formed a profound array. It was the famous Dragon Cloud Art of the Hidden Sword Manor. It was a flawless attack that should overwhelm Lin Yun.

Looking at this scene, Feng Xuanzi and the other elders nodded their heads. Feng Xingyang clearly had some status in the Hidden Sword Manor or he wouldn’t be allowed to practice the Dragon Cloud Art. At the very least, he should be an inner disciple.

Just when no one felt hopeful for Lin Yun, he closed his eyes. In the next second, something bizarre took place as the nine afterimages closing in on him froze in place.

Standing in the center, Lin Yun casually strolled and avoided Feng Xingyang’s sword attack. Lin Yun was walking slowly, but no one could see his afterimages. This instantly left everyone dumbfounded. They weren’t sure if Feng Xingyang’s sword was too slow or if Lin Yun’s movement technique was too fast.

The once confident Feng Xiaoyu was now trembling in fear, “What the hell is going on? Who the hell is he?!”

Gongsun Yan smiled, “You probably don’t know, but Lin Yun joined the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect half a year ago and ascended the Sword Saint Mountain the moment he joined the sect. He even caused the bell of dao to ring out over the entire sect. There’s also the matter that happened not too long ago. He reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, that legendary stage of the Heavenly SOul Realm. Feng Xingyang thinks that he can crush Lin Yun easily because of his cultivation, but there’s no way he can compete with Lin Yun in the Heavenly Soul Realm.”

Everyone took in a cold breath when they heard that because the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm was something that even descendants of the saint clans couldn’t achieve

“How is that possible?! How can a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm?! Gongsun Yan, do you think we’re fools?” Gong Haoran said, clearly not willing to believe Gongsun Yan’s words.

Although Zhao Yan didn’t say a word, he also felt like Gongsun Yan was exaggerating things. Zhao Yan was certain that Lin Yun’s sword intent was stronger than his, but he couldn’t believe that Lin Yun reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm.

“Even if he really reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, there’s no way he can defeat Feng Xingyang in one sword, not to mention that it’s impossible for him to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm,” Gong Haoran spoke emotionally. Clearly, he was triggered by Gongsun Yan’s words.

After all, he was evenly matched with Feng Xingyang. If Lin Yun could defeat Feng Xingyang with one sword, this meant that Lin Yun could also defeat him. It was an outcome that he couldn’t accept.

“No need to be so nervous. I’m only sharing what I know, and it’s up to you whether you believe me or not,” smiled Gongsun Yan. His words made Feng Xiaoyu nervous while she looked at the stage. But she was feeling hopeful after hearing Gong Haoran’s disbelief that Lin Yun only needed one sword.

If Lin Yun couldn’t defeat Feng Xingyang with one sword, then he would have to sever an arm. At that time, he would be crippled regardless of how talented he was. Feng Xiaoyu felt scared of Lin Yun’s potential, so she was hoping he would be crippled. After all, she didn’t want him to get revenge on her in the future.

Gongsun Yan’s words caused the crowd to watch Lin Yun in anticipation. Even Gongsun Yan was looking at Lin Yun with interest. At the same time, bizarre runes were flickering in his pupils. With his eyes, he could see through every single detail of the battle.

Zhao Yan glanced at Gongsun Yan with lingering fear flashing through his eyes because he could sense that Gongsun Yan had grown a lot stronger than before. Now, he couldn’t even see through Gongsun Yan’s strength.

A brief moment later, Feng Xiaoyu became even more nervous because Feng Xingyang had practically used all available means aside from holy spirit martial techniques. The stage was enveloped with his sword rays, but he still couldn’t even touch Lin Yun. At the same time, Feng Xingyang’s sword aura had started to decline.

This caused an uproar because they knew that Feng Xingyang was slowly exhausting himself to death. Once Feng Xingyang’s sword aura completely declined, it would be easy for Lin Yun to defeat him.

Feng Xingyang could only rely on the holy spirit martial technique now, but he didn’t dare to take the bet with beads of sweat covering his forehead. If his holy spirit martial technique failed, he would face Lin Yun’s strongest attack and lose. But if he didn’t use his holy spirit marital technique, he would still fail from exhaustion.

“Feng Xingyang is going to lose…” Zhao Yan said. The faces of everyone on the stage gradually changed and not even Gong Haoran spoke a single word.

“I’ve already said that he’s practically invincible in the Heavenly Soul Realm, and those who can defeat him can be counted on the fingers of two hands. The limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm is stronger than all of you can imagine, not to mention his attainment in the sword is too deep,” said Gongsun Yan.

“Is he going to lose? Is that fellow really going to sweep through the Sword Assembly?” Feng Xiaoyu spoke in a trembling voice with her face turning pale.

Gong Haoran smiled, “Don’t worry about it. Brother Gongsun is from the Sword Emperor’s lineage, and his sky sword intent has reached complete mastery. It’s impossible for Lin Yun to sweep through the Sword Assembly.”

The Sword Emperor was one of the Nine Emperors, and his name was Yu Qingfeng. Hearing what Gong Haoran said surprised everyone because they didn’t think that Gongsun Yan’s sect was actually a lineage of the Sword Emperor.

“There’s a huge difference between the sect and me. Brother Gong, you don’t have to flatter me. But I did grasp some means of the Sword Emperor’s lineage,” said Gongsun Yan faintly.

“Then I’ll have to ask Brother Gongsun to help out later to protect the prestige of my Feng Clan,” said Feng Xiaoyu.

“I’m here for the saint sword. If he really stands in my way, I’ll have no choice but to make a move even if my victory might not be just.” smiled Gongsun Yan. He had long seen through Lin Yun’s strength, and he knew that Lin Yun had ascended the Sword Saint Mountain along with reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm.

Although he was humble, the intelligence system of the Sword Emperor’s lineage was the strongest in Kunlun Realm. It was a pity that Lin Yun ran into him because he was prepared.
