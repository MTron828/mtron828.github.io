Chapter 1257 - Fearless

When Jiang Lichen and the rest heard Lin Yun’s words, he was already gone when they looked up. Their eyes flashed with a hint of heat before they swiftly calmed down. After all, the place that produced the fruit was too dangerous, and they might get caught up in the turmoil even when they were watching from a distance away. Only Lin Yun was bold enough to fearlessly face such a situation.

“We’re just letting him go like that?” Ye Ziling asked while glancing at Luo Hua. She knew that it was dangerous, and it wasn’t wise for Lin Yun to head over by himself.

“Let him go ahead,” replied Luo Hua. Her words were filled with confidence for Lin Yun, which left Ye Ziling surprised. Could it be that Luo Hua was already acquainted with Lin Yun before the latter joined the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?

Hearing Luo Hua’s tone, she could speculate that they had a close relationship, as if they had already known each other for a long time. Ye Ziling took a long look at her before she fell into silence with doubts filling her heart.

On the other hand, Lin Yun executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformation, turning into a golden streak and arrived at where the fruit appeared in the blink of an eye. It was a crimson fruit enveloped in a dense fragrance, unleashing a rainbow light that soared to a few hundred feet in the sky.

Several figures were charging towards the fruit with excitement in their eyes. Just the fact that they could stand out amongst the thousands of people was enough to prove that they were strong.

“It’s just an ordinary vermillion fruit, but its growth was hastened by the rainbow light.” Lin Yun was disappointed when he found out what was wrong with the fruit. Although the age of the fruit wasn’t fake, it was still lacking compared to those who had reached that age naturally, not to mention that the vermillion fruit was too ordinary.

On the other hand, fruits like Dragon Blood Fruit were a lot more valuable when they reached a thousand years old. But since he was already here, he might as well take this fruit away.

With a smile, Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art and eight hundred dragon runes appeared on his right leg. At the same time, all his vitality poured into his right leg. When he stomped his foot on the ground, an explosive power broke out with cracks spreading out on the surface of the ground.

In the next second, he had already flown past everyone who was heading for the fruit, causing their faces to change. When they saw Lin Yun again, he was already before the vermillion fruit. Their mouths were widened by Lin Yun’s speed.

As Lin Yun picked the vermillion fruit, he said, “It’s just as I’ve speculated. Mhm? Something doesn’t seem right. The age of this fruit is above three thousand years old, so why is the spiritual energy in it so lacking?”

“Indeed. This is at least two times weaker than ordinary vermillion fruit that has reached three thousand years old.” Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded out in Lin Yun’s ears.

But Lin Yun wasn’t disappointed. After all, this fruit was forcibly ripened, and it wasn’t a saint elixir, to begin with. It could only be considered as a slightly more impressive elixir. Perhaps it might be precious in the eyes of others, but this could barely satisfy Lin Yun.

This island was too remote, and it wasn’t enveloped by a lot of rainbow light. Perhaps he could take a look at the other islands.

“Brat, put the fruit down!”

“We’re the ones who had an eye on the fruit first!”

“Who the hell are you?” Several voices disrupted Lin Yun’s thoughts. They were the ones who were outsped by Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun turned his attention over, he couldn’t even tell where they were from, so they must be from sects within the Ancient Barren Domain. Their cultivation wasn’t low, since they were at the Astral Stage. Furthermore, their auras were also stronger than the four sects in the Profound Azure Prefecture.

It looks like the Profound Azure Prefecture is too small. Even a disciple from an ordinary sect from the Ancient Barren Domain could easily crush them.

“Sorry about that, but this fruit belongs to me, Lin Yun, now. So, please leave,” said Lin Yun with his eyes squinted.

“Who the hell are you? Are you courting death?” A robust man coldly looked at Lin Yun with a killing aura filling his eyes. The others were also looking at Lin Yun, trying to see through him. But they couldn’t sense anything aside from the fact that Lin Yun was at the pinnacle Galaxy Stage.

Their confrontation also drew attention from the surroundings. A man with a fiery temper made his move first and stomped his foot on the ground, emitting a violent aura, then charged toward Lin Yun. “Since you’re courting death, then I’ll cripple you!”

He reached out with his hand with lightning flickering from his palm and emitted waves of lightning aura. Then, his hand formed into claws that were aiming at Lin Yun’s head. He wanted to restrain Lin Yun before making him beg him for mercy.

But Lin Yun didn’t even bat an eye at him and thrust two fingers at the man’s palm. This immediately left a bloody hole in the palm of the man, causing the man to wail in pain. When he looked at Lin Yun’s smile again, the man could only feel a chill down his spine.

He wanted to retreat immediately, but Lin Yun grabbed ahold of his wrist and pulled him back. Then, Lin Yun easily grabbed onto the man’s neck and lifted him off the ground.

“Let me go! I’m a disciple of the Violetcloud Sect, so you can’t kill me!” The man yelled out in panic.

“Why should I care where you’re from?” A cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s face. This person wasn’t worthy of his pity, since he wanted to cripple him at the beginning. When he gave the man a slap, the man was instantly turned into a bloody mist as his body blew apart. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This scene instantly made everyone else who wanted to charge over to squint their eyes and stop where they were.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun waved his hand and pushed a palm out. His attack made the others spew a mouthful of blood before they were sent flying back. When they landed on the ground, they immediately fled for their lives without turning back.

As the surroundings fell into silence, everyone looked at Lin Yun with shock.

“Holy shit, where did this person come from?”

“The Violetcloud Sect is a decent sect in the Ancient Barren Domain, but this young man killed one of their disciples without any hesitation. Just where did he come from?”

“Did that young man say that his name was Lin Yun? Is there such a person in the Ancient Barren Domain?” Most of the people here were from the Ancient Barren Domain, so they naturally knew nothing about the Profound Azure Prefecture or Lin Yun’s name.

After all, the Azurerock Hidden Sword Pavilion was only famous amongst swordsmen, and only those bigger sects would know about it. Right at this moment, another rainbow light exploded on the island, making Lin Yun’s eyes light up before he charged over.

“Quick, follow him!”

“That youth is really arrogant. He’s going after another one when he has already obtained a thousand-year fruit?”

“He wants to sweep the entire island?” Everyone’s eyes lit up as they headed after the rainbow light. They had their own objectives. They were curious about Lin Yun’s origin, but Lin Yun would only take the thousand-year fruit, not even batting an eye at the surrounding herbs.

Compared to others, Lin Yun was a lot more generous. So this was the reason why so many people followed after him. It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to collect all the thousand-year fruits on the island. He was overbearing and didn’t hold back in his attack, killing anyone who dared to compete with him.

At the same time, his massacre soon attracted much attention. When Lin Yun saw that no other elixirs appeared on the island, he left for the next island.

“Holy shit, he’s not satisfied even after sweeping this entire island?”

“It might be possible after looking at his tracks.”

When Lin Yun swept two more nearby islands, someone said behind him, “Young man, it’s time for you to stop. If you carry on, you might start a conflict with the Azure Thunder Sect.”

“That’s right. The Azure Thunder Sect is the sovereign in the nearby ten-odd islands. Anyone who seized elixirs here has to hand some over to them,” said someone else.

“Yeah. Those you’ve killed are the same, they’ll have to hand a portion over after they have finished their harvest.” Several people who have been following behind Lin Yun advised.

Lin Yun briefly pondered, then instantly knew what was going on. The entire Profound Wither Sea has been divided up by the sects from the Ancient Barren Domain, with each powerful sect dominating the nearby ten-odd islands as well. After all, those islands could still give birth to elixirs and it made no sense to give them up.

As for the weaker sects, they would split up the other sea regions. After all, the sea was massive, and the Profound Azure Prefecture was only a small part of it. With such a huge territory, it naturally gave birth to many other sects aside from powerful sects.

There were even some sects that weren’t too far behind powerful sects and were only lacking in their foundation. So even the weaker sects were colossal to the sects in the Profound Azure Prefecture, so no one would want to offend them.

The Azure Thunder Sect was such a sect, and they also had an ancient origin. Lin Yun knew that with just ten-odd core disciples, they occupied this entire region and no one dared to compete with them. Furthermore, he could see fear in the eyes of these people when they mentioned the Azure Thunder Sect.

“I’m not afraid of the Azure Thunder Sect. If you guys are, you guys can stay away from me,” smiled Lin Yun. He didn’t fear anyone from the same generation, not to mention he had Feng Jue behind him. So why would he be afraid? He would be generous enough if he didn’t bully the Azure Thunder Sect.

“He’s finished. He’ll start a conflict with the Azure Thunder Sect sooner or later.”

“He’s too arrogant. We better stay away from him.” Seeing how Lin Yun was unconcerned when they mentioned the Azure Thunder Sect, those who were following Lin Yun had fear written on their faces.
