Chapter 2299 - Famous In The World

Zhuge Qingyun and Qin Cang wore grave expressions because this information was too shocking to them. It was so much so that they still hadn’t digested that information while nervously waiting for Tian Xuanzi’s summons.

“Flower Burial Sword Saint, the Radiant Sword Saint has taken in a good disciple,” Zhuge Qingyun sighed. He had already become a Saint Sovereign and was talented, but he was lacking when compared to the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciples. Everyone was concerned about Lin Yun becoming a Sword Saint, but he was more concerned about Ye Guhan.

The Radiant Sword Saint’s chief disciple was a Great Saint and had even grasped Space Dao, which was unimaginable to him. Tian Xuanzi was strong, but his disciples were pale in comparison to the Radiant Sword Saint.

Tian Xuanzi never discussed it, but they all felt reluctant as disciples. They included Jian Jingtian, who was now a King, a rare state beneath the Saint Realm and above the Quasi-Saint Realm. But wanting to become a King required special opportunities and great risk, such as Jian Jingtian staying in the Dragon Pulse Realm for a decade. If Jian Jingtian hadn’t made a breakthrough, he would have been blown apart from the energies that had accumulated within his body in just a few years.

But Jian Jingtian ultimately made the breakthrough, becoming a King. Zhuge Qingyun could still suppress Jian Jingtian since he was a Saint Sovereign, but Jian Jingtian’s potential was even more terrifying than Ye Guhan once he could get through it. Just thinking about it was enough to give Zhuge Qingyun a headache.

Qin Cang’s face changed. He only felt shocked and fortunate that his master told him to give up on the sword and focus on the physique, cultivating the Devour Dao. But he knew that he was only comforting himself.

“Come in.” Tian Xuanzi’s voice resounded just when the two were feeling nervous. When the two stepped in, they entered an ethereal valley with a chessboard before Tian Xuanzi.

Tian Xuanzi was playing chess with someone. Whenever he placed a chess piece down, a woman’s hand would appear and place another chess piece. Zhuge Qingyun and Qin Cang weren’t surprised when they saw this and waited outside the valley.

“You’ve improved. I might not be able to beat you soon.” A voice resounded as Tian Xuanzi replied with a smile. When he wanted to reply, ripples spread out in the sky, as if that person had left.

Tian Xuanzi was stunned before he smiled and called his two disciples over. His unrivaled appearance would make any flower inferior to his beauty. He looked like he was in a painting, isolated from the outside world.

The Nine-Tailed Fox came over to Qin Cang’s side and pounced over. The Nine-Tailed Fox was a primordial beast known for its ferocity. It was normally only close to Tian Xuanzi and Qin Cang.

Qin Cang smiled as he opened his arms and took out the fruit he had prepared for the Nine-Tailed Fox. He said, “Master, it’s still so adorable.”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Only you would say that,” Tian Xuanzi smiled.

“Master, Lin Yun has become a Sword Saint!” Zhuge Qingyun said anxiously.

“What’s so surprising about that? He’s the most talented disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint,” Tian Xuanzi replied.

Zhuge Qingyun continued, “This matter has a huge influence. Many forces in the Eastern Desolation have stopped to watch the outcome. They either brush our orders to the side or ignore us.”

After the Heavenly Dao Sect’s incident, the three holy lands were at their prime, with no one daring to disobey them. But after the battle outside the God Burial Mountain Range, everything changed and they no longer stood on the three holy lands’ side. That was especially true for the forces who went into the Heavenly Void. It wouldn’t be surprising if they suddenly stood on Lin Yun’s side. Those forces didn’t have an Emperor, only a few Saint Sovereigns, but they were a force to be reckoned with if they joined together.

“That’s a problem,” Tian Xuanzi said.

“Lin Yun is in the Divine Phoenix Mountain. If he can convince the Divine Phoenix Mountain, it might affect us,” Zhuge Qingyun analysed.

“There’s no need to hurry. It’s hard for the Divine Phoenix Mountain to change just because of him. Take a trip to the Divine Dao Pavilion with some gifts,” Tian Xuanzi said.

“Not the Divine Phoenix Mountain?” Zhuge Qingyun asked.

“Even Lin Yun might be unable to convince the Divine Phoenix Mountain, not to mention you. But the Divine Dao Pavilion needs a little suppressing,” Tian Xuanzi said.

“What about Ye Guhan? His junior brother has become a Sword Saint, so he must be making some movements, right?” Tian Xuanzi asked.

“He’s already a Great Saint and has even grasped Space Dao,” Zhuge Qingyun replied.

“It’s no wonder why you felt that you could kill me…” Tian Xuanzi smiled as he messed up the chessboard.

“I’ll take a trip to the Black Mountain. Qingyun, you come with me,” Tian Xuanzi said.

“Got it.” Zhuge Qingyun knew that his master was starting to plan now. His master had a good relationship with the Seven Saints of the Black Mountain, and his master was finally going to move this chess piece.

“What about me?” Qin Cang asked.

Tian Xuanzi looked at the valley and said, “This valley is empty, so you can stay here and accompany the Nine-Tailed Fox.”

When he was done speaking, he placed his hand on Zhuge Qingyun’s shoulder and disappeared as space fluctuated.

This made Qin Cang stumped, witnessing his master’s Space Dao reaching an incredible height. His gaze fell onto the chessboard with curiosity before he placed the Nine-Tailed Fox down and approached it. When he touched a chess piece, he was sent flying away, throwing out a mouthful of blood and falling onto one knee. When he looked at the chessboard again, he had fear in his eyes as he wondered who his master was playing with.

“You think you’re qualified to touch the chessboard?” He heard a roar. “So you’re Tian Xuanzi’s disciple. Alright, come and play with me.”

Qin Cang was shocked, feeling as though he was talking with a faraway deity. He could faintly see a blurred figure giving off a powerful aura and had a pair of golden eyes.

In the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, Feng Jue rushed in like a sword and reached the mountain's summit. He emotionally said, “Jian Jingtian, Junior Brother has become a Sword Saint!”

Jian Jingtian opened his eyes. There was a massive sword behind him, giving off a terrifying pressure. He smiled, “A Sword Saint? He has finally surpassed me.”

Feng Jue said, “You’re humble. Your Divine Light Sword Intent is close to solidifying. If you make a breakthrough, you’ll probably become a Great Saint immediately.”

“How can it be that easy?” Jian Jingtian sighed. He swore he wouldn’t take a step from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and it had been two decades since then. If he couldn’t take this step out, he would still die, sooner or later.

The sword that Feng Jue saw reflected the sword in Jian Jingtian’s heart. The actual sword in his heart was even more terrifying. Jian Jingtian said, “You have to work hard and become a Saint. Master said that you’re someone who will grow faster in the end, but you still haven’t even become a Saint. If you manage to become a Saint, I can leave it to you if I fail. But you can’t bear it with your current cultivation.”

Feng Jue felt helpless and said, “There’s a huge change in the world. Others easily make a breakthrough to the Saint Realm, but I’m stuck.”

Jian Jingtian said nothing since he knew where Feng Jue’s problem lay. The inheritance that their master gave Feng Jue was special out of all the martial brothers. He used own his internal organs as a sword array, using the body to refine the unrivalled sword array!

Out of all the martial brothers, only Feng Jue was suitable to cultivate that. But Feng Jue could only rely on himself to comprehend the profundity. If someone had told him about it, Feng Jue might have died.

At the same time, Flower Burial Sword Saint’s name began to spread throughout the Kunlun Realm, especially in Skysolute City.

“Sword Saint?”

“A Sword Saint who isn’t even thirty? Isn’t this a little too unbelievable?”

“He’s the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, Champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path. The famous Flower Burial.”

“...” The entire Skysolute City was shocked since Skysolute City was known to be the best in the sword.

Mei Zihua rushed into a pavilion within the Divine Dragon Empire and smiled, “Li Wuyou, your big brother has become a Sword Saint.”

The youth was Li Wuyou from the Profound Amber Realm’s Sword Firmament Pavilion. He left a letter and left for the Kunlun Realm after retrieving the Vermilion Bird’s divine blood.
