Chapter 1826 - Silver-Eyed Demonspirit (1)

As time passed, the number of Quasi-Saints began to decrease. The already intense battle became even more bloody, and the density of blood here became even more terrifying. But everyone was still competing for the Black Tortoise Cores, and none of them paid any attention to the changes happening on the Black Tortoise engraving on the square under the blood. Deep within the square, there was a silver statue quietly swallowing the blood from the surrounding water.

“Weird, there seem to be some changes on the engraving on the floor.” Mei Zihua noticed the changes in the engraving on the stone slabs since he couldn’t join the battle. When most of the Quasi-Saints were reduced to Black Tortoise Cores, the engraving on the stone stabs became even brighter, especially under the blood within the water. It looked like a Black Tortoise was slowly awakening.

This made Mei Zihua surprised, and he raised his head to look at Lin Yun. When he looked at Lin Yun, he saw that Lin Yun was still collecting the Black Tortoise Cores. In the end, he could only grit his teeth and swim closer to the engraving.

Half a stick of incense later, An Liuyan approached Lin Yun, and said, “Young Master, nine cores now.”

“Good.” Lin Yun smiled. He had collected eighteen Black Tortoise Cores. It was more than enough for him to reach the pinnacle of the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. They had a lot of harvests, and all the Quasi-Saints were practically gone. It was a pretty good time for them to stop.

But right then, seven figures flew over. The one leading the party was a black-clothed man. He looked at Lin Yun and An Liuyan with greed, “As expected of the Nirvana Banquet’s champion and Boss An, to collect so many Black Tortoise Cores. How envious.”

The competition for the Black Tortoise Cores had almost come to an end, and they could only target others if they wanted more. Similar scenes were happening around the surroundings, and Lin Yun wasn’t the only one being targeted. That meant that it wouldn’t be easy for them to get away.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned, and a cold light flashed across his pupils. He said, “Interesting. I have yet to target others, and yet I’m already being targeted. Hand over half of your Black Tortoise Cores or all of you will die.”

The seven who heard that were stunned. They had the advantage in numbers, and they were all at the Pinnacle of the third stage Profound Life Stage, and the leader seemed to be at the fourth stage. So wasn’t Lin Yun’s tone a little too arrogant?

“I…” The leader spoke. But before he could finish, Lin Yun already charged over with a hundred thousand dragon runes enveloping him. As a dragon roar echoed from his body, Lin Yun was like an Azure Dragon charging forth.

The Azure Dragon Saint Physique could enable him to freely move around within the pool. He could even absorb the lightning energy within the surroundings. On the other hand, it was impressive if the other party could bring out 60% of their strength within the pool.

When he threw a punch, a hundred thousand golden-purple dragon runes manifested into a dragon’s head and charged forth. This scene made the face of the black-clothed man sink, and he was instantly covered in a layer of black scales that gave off metallic flickers. Evidently, he had a powerful physique.

But when the two punches collided, a powerful shockwave swept out, causing the surrounding water to explode.

“Sword!” Lin Yun’s forehead shone and his sword intent began to gush out. While he was being enveloped in a golden radiance, he shredded the incoming dragon origin into pieces. He didn’t take a single step back in the previous clash, but his opponent took several steps back.

“What a powerful sword intent…” The black-clothed man’s pupils lingered with fear, and he knew that he couldn’t underestimate Lin Yun. With no hesitation, he charged forth and clashed with Lin Yun head-on.

An Liuyan also dashed out, showing great agility, and faced six enemies at the same time. The strength she displayed was, even more unbelievable than Lin Yun's.

“Myriad Demon Eyes!” An Liuyan’s pupils turned into a kaleidoscope, and the six were pulled into an illusion before they could even respond. This illusion was made up of countless crimson fans, and there was an afterimage of hers standing on each fan.

When they tried to maintain their consciousness, the blood fans swiftly left wounds all around their bodies. By the time they broke free from the illusion, the Profound Moon Fan flew from her hand. The rotating fan was like a blade, leaving a line across the six of their necks.

Their faces were pale, and they quickly held onto their necks in a panic. But An Liuyan gently raised her brow and charged towards them, snatching their Black Tortoise Cores. “You guys want to leave?”

Simultaneously, the black-clothed man beside Lin Yun was knocked away by the Flicking Divine Finger with a hole created in his chest. When blood began to flow out from his chest, this instantly made the black-clothed man panic.

When he saw his six companions’ necks nearly severed and chose to flee, he unwillingly threw three Black Tortoise Cores behind, “Here, take it.”

Lin Yun wasn’t polite, and took the three Black Tortoise Cores. Right then, An Liuyan came forth. She had obtained fourteen Black Tortoise Cores from those six. She said, “Half of the Black Tortoise Cores on him is definitely more than three.”

“It’s enough.” Lin Yun said. He knew that he would have to reveal his trump cards to kill that person, not to mention there were others eyeing him. So he didn’t want any more trouble.

Right then, the black-clothed man who fled was knocked flying back, leaving Lin Yun and An Liuyan stunned. But before they could do anything, that person’s body blew apart, leaving his heart behind. A silver claw then reached out and grabbed the heart before gulping it down.

This was the silver statue at the bottom of the pool coming to ‘life,’ and the demonic runes on it began to crackle with lightning.

Lin Yun’s face changed because he already noticed that there was something unusual about this place. After all, there must be a reason why so many Quasi-Saints died.

“Where’s Mei Zihua?” Lin Yun quickly retreated with An Liuyan, and he could see everyone fleeing for their lives as this region started falling into chaos.

“He was still around just a moment ago.” An Liuyan replied.

This made Lin Yun furrow his brows, before he immediately used his Sword Heart to search the surroundings. A brief moment later, he opened his eyes and said, “I can’t see him. Let’s quickly leave this place.”

The two quickly headed up the pool. Behind them was a group of Profound Life Stage experts. Behind them was a corpse shrouded in silver light chasing after them.

“That seems to be a demonic corpse at the Saint Realm.” An Liuyan said nervously.

“I’m not too sure about it. Perhaps it might be a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, but this demonspirit is unlike the others. Let’s talk about it again after we leave this place.” Lin Yun had interacted with a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit back at the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and he knew how terrifying it was.

The martial techniques they practiced were devilish and ancient. It was completely different from the Divine Dragon Era’s martial dao. Then again, it might also be a saint of the Black Tortoise’s lineage who became a monster after his death and was corroded by the demonic aura.

Not many people knew about the Demonspirit Clan’s means in the Kunlun Realm. When they broke free from the square and passed through the vortex, only then did everyone feel relieved.

“We don’t have to be so anxious. That corpse was definitely a saint when it was still alive. So it might give birth to a saint-grade core!” A voice resounded. It came from Kou Tianhua, who spread his voice out through dragon origin. But he didn’t stop there and continued, “A saint of the Black Tortoise Clan has more than one core, at least nine and at most thirty-two. The saint-grade cores are way better than the quasi-saint cores.”

Yu Wenxiu’s face changed a little, and he smiled, “Well, it might not be impossible. We have to give it a try, no matter what.”

They wanted to take this opportunity to calm everyone down before the silver corpse came out to kill it.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“We won’t be joining.” Lin Yun pulled An Liuyan to the side because he had a weird feeling from the silver corpse. Since these people were so greedy, they would probably suffer greatly because of it.

Not long after everyone came to an agreement, a bizarre roar came from the vortex and a silver demonic corpse dashed out.

Lin Yun was surprised to see the clothes on this demonic corpse because the clothes it wore belonged to the Thunder Black Tortoise’s lineage. But there was a silver line on the forehead of this demonic corpse, and he could faintly see an unopened vertical eye. This was the reason why he felt weird.

“Let’s go!” Just when Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts, Kou Tianhua and the others dashed over because the temptation of saint-grade cores was too great. This demonic corpse might’ve been strong when it was alive, but it was currently equivalent to a Profound Death Stage, and it had yet to regain its intelligence.

Kou Tianhua and Yu Wenxiu stood at the front, while everyone else assisted from the side, and they actually managed to suppress this demonic corpse.
