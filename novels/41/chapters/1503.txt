Chapter 1504 - Retrieving the Demon-Refining Fruit

Lin Yun quickly fled, but Ku Ying was faster. Just when Lin Yun left, Ku Ying had already caught up to him, and Ku Ying naturally did it on purpose. He had been eyeing Lin Yun, and there was no way Lin Yun could flee if he wanted to stop him.

Ku Ying naturally didn’t hold any hope for the glory saint artifact, but hope rose in his heart once more when he saw Xie Feng being heavily injured. So when he saw Lin Yun flee, he briefly hesitated. If he could quickly destroy Lin Yun’s corpse, he might have a chance at taking the umbrella for himself.

He believed Xie Feng wouldn’t dare to flip the table with him, at least not while they were still in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. As for when they left the astral realm, he hadn’t thought that far. There was something certain: Xie Feng wouldn’t dare to spread this around. After all, if Samsara Edict Realm experts made a move at that time, there would be nothing for him.

When Ku Ying quickly processed his thoughts, he chased after Lin Yun. He had a change of opinion about him. After all, Xie Feng was one of the seven core disciples with a cultivation at the pinnacle eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. He had some opportunities in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.

Even Ku Ying didn’t dare to look down on someone like Xie Feng, but Lin Yun relied on an umbrella to force Xie Feng into such a terrible state. But this further proved that this umbrella was extraordinary.

Ku Ying was fast, but he didn’t use his full speed. As he listened to the footsteps behind him, he knew that Xie Feng had become anxious, and a smile rose on his lips. He hoped Lin Yun could flee even further, at least far enough that Xie Feng wouldn’t be able to catch up anytime soon. It was pointless if he quickly caught up to Lin Yun, so he wore a calm smile.

He already saw that Lin Yun was about to reach his limit, and it was taxing for him to use the glory saint artifact because it was considered a trump card.

“Run, keep running!” Ku Ying wore an eerie smile as he followed behind him.

Not long later, the White Dragon Palace’s gate was pushed open by Ku Ying, and daylight shone in. Dawn finally arrived, and every dragon palace emitted a faint light with a dragon aura.

This Dragon Remnant Astral Realm wasn’t simple. Ku Ying didn’t know this was a special place, but his instincts told him that this astral realm wasn’t simple. It probably contained a huge secret related to the battle between the deities, or it might be associated with a primordial sect.

When the nine emperors appeared, it was said that they received the inheritance of a particular sect. But he soon tossed it to the back of his mind because the interest right before his eyes was more important.

Ku Ying was surprised because he noticed that Lin Yun suddenly turned around. When Lin Yun turned around, he smiled, “I’ve been waiting for you for a long time!”

This made Ku Ying feel weird while looking at Lin Yun’s broken wings and pale face. This proved that Lin Yun had reached his limit, and thinking about it made Ku Ying smile with pity in his pupils. It was too much of a shame for such a genius like Lin Yun to die here. He raised his finger and smiled, “Do you know what this means?”

Seeing Lin Yun shake his head, the sympathy in Ku Ying’s pupils grew even denser as he answered, “This means that I only need one finger to kill you!”

He suddenly disappeared. When he reappeared, he thrust his finger, giving off the feeling that his finger could pierce through the sky. Seeing Lin Yun struggling, Ku Ying’s eyes flashed with mockery, “I said that you’re already dead!”

His thrusted finger was aimed at Lin Yun’s forehead. If his attack connected, there was no doubt that Lin Yun would lose his life. Ku Ying didn’t think that he would fail, which made him pity Lin Yun.

“As I said, I’ve been waiting for you!” A cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils as he formed a seal. The Myriad Lightning Divine Rune that Lil’ Purple had long prepared in the secret realm was sent out by Lin Yun when he began forming his seal. Suddenly a ball of lightning appeared.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ku Ying, flying towards the ball of lightning, had fear on his face because his vision was filled with lightning. This was the power of a sovereign divine rune. Along with a huge explosion, Ku Ying was sent flying away, and he was torn into pieces.

Although Lin Yun had retreated, the shockwave ultimately caught up to him. After he threw out a mouthful of blood, he fell onto one knee and raised his head to look at the chaos. The sky was filled with lightning flickering around, and the light was so dazzling that he didn’t dare to look at it directly.

Looking at the pieces of flesh on the ground, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with mockery, “You can kill me with one finger? You really know how to act!”

He had to admit that Ku Ying really knew how to act, but it was a pity that he acted against the wrong person. After he swallowed a Profound Wither Pellet, he picked up the umbrella on the ground.

“The glory saint artifact is powerful.” Lin Yun muttered to himself.

“That’s because you’re too weak.” Lil’ Purple said in disdain.

Lin Yun smiled because Lil’ Purple wasn’t wrong. He changed the topic, “The power of the Sovereign Divine Rune is really strong. Ku Ying should’ve been comparable to the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, right?”

“Don’t overthink it. He’s only at the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, at best; those who hadn’t formed their dragon origin. No matter how terrible a person’s foundation can be, they’ll start forming their dragon origin at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. At that time, it will be useless no matter how many stars you have. So don’t underestimate the Dragon Pulse Realm!”

“Is that so?”

“Quick, leave! I can’t activate the Sovereign Divine Rune again. You have to compensate me with 5,000 kilograms of true dragon saint liquid for this!” Lil’ Purple urged, and her voice was weak. She had also paid an enormous price to activate the Sovereign Divine Rune.

Nodding his head, Lin Yun stowed the umbrella and continued to flee.

Not long after he left, the gates of the White Dragon Palace were pushed open once more, and their sight was filled with lightning. Before they could even react, a wave of lightning swept over, and Xie Feng yelled, “Close the gates!”

But the fluctuation still swept over, and they were all sent flying away. Xie Feng was shocked by this and asked, “What’s going on?”

Is this the power of that old fellow Ku Ying? Isn’t he a little too terrifying?

Lin Yun returned to the region where they initially came in. But just when he was about to leave, his gaze fell onto the Primordial Demon-Refining Tree. He had recovered some of his injuries, but his arm felt sour, and he couldn’t use much of his strength.

“What are you trying to do?” Lil’ Purple cautiously asked.

Lin Yun didn’t reply to her. He looked at the saint fruits hanging on the Primoridal Demon-Refining Tree and fell into deep thoughts. “The Demon-Refining Fruits should be the most precious saint fruit in this primordial space, right?”

“That’s for sure. Those are nurtured with the corpses of saint fiends, and they’re definitely stronger than those saint fruits outside. But don’t bother thinking about it…” Before she could finish, Lin Yun had already moved, making Lil’ Purple exclaim, “Don’t be impulsive!”

But Lin Yun didn’t care about her and continued to head towards the Primordial Demon-Refining Tree. He looked at the umbrella and fell into deep thought. It was true that, normally, he might lose his life if he went after the fruits, but it might be different now.

Stowing the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, Lin Yun took out something from his interspatial bracelet and increased his speed. He was holding onto the Divine White Dragon Bone. When he stepped into the range of the saint tree, Lil’ Purple held her breath.

Lin Yun discovered that he had entered a dark space, and a black hand was directed at him. But just when he wanted to move, one hand after another broke out from the ground and grabbed onto him.

As a burst of weird laughter resounded, fear enveloped Lin Yun, except that the laughter sounded much more terrifying this time. He could feel his mentality collapsing, his vision blurred, and he couldn’t move.

In the crucial moment, the Divine White Dragon Bone emitted a faint light with a white dragon coiling around him. As the hands and peals of laughter disappeared, Lin Yun’s vision cleared up, and the Primordial Demon-Refining Tree reappeared.

Before Lin Yun could think more about it, he rose into the air and grabbed a Demon-Refining Fruit. When he held onto the fruit, his face became red with excitement. But just when he was about to reach for the second one, the corpses hanging on the tree started moving and countless pairs of peculiar eyesockets stared at him.

This made Lin Yun feel a chill down his spine with his back covered in a cold sweat. When he left the range of the saint tree, he suddenly came to his senses and looked at the Demon-Refining Fruit in his hand, exclaiming, “What did I just do?”

“You plucked a Demon-Refining Fruit!” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun raised his head to look at the Demon-Refining Tree before lowering his head. He had no memory of what happened earlier, which was too bizarre. Ultimately, his gaze fell onto his hand, “The Divine White Dragon Bone…”

Was this a gift from the White Dragon Clan? He couldn’t figure it out, but he gave a bow in the White Dragon Palace’s direction, before quickly leaving this region.

An hour later, Lin Yun activated the Aurora Dragon Pupils and found the two of them. When the two saw Lin Yun, they also rejoiced.

“You really came out safely!” Xiao Yun rejoiced. “I’ll call you big brother from now on. What about Ku Ying? How did you manage to escape?”

“He’s dead.” Lin Yun said before he continued, “Let’s go. I’ll bring you guys out of this place.”

The two were still shocked by the death of Ku Ying. But when they heard Lin Yun wanted to bring them out, they were shocked again.

“Leave?” Xiao Yun was surprised. He had been trapped here for a long time and still hadn’t found the exit. The flow of time here was different from the outside world.

They could naturally leave after finding the nirvana node, and the Aurora Dragon Pupils could see through all illusions. When Lin Yun used the Aurora Dragon Pupils to look for Xiao Yun and An Liuyan, he also found the nirvana node.
