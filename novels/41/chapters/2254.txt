Chapter 2255 - Nothing Impressive About The Divine Physique

Two figures could be faintly seen undressing before the bridal chamber began to shake. This process lasted a long time, so long that Lil’ Purple fell asleep from boredom. It had already been three days when she woke up, and the bridal chamber was still shaking.

“It hasn’t ended yet?” Lil’ Purple pouted with confusion. Does it usually take so long? This lasted for another half a day before the shaking in the bridal chamber finally stopped.

“My back aches…”

“Darling, where are you feeling uncomfortable?”

“My back…”

“Let me help you massage it.”

“Okay.”

“Does it still ache?”

“It doesn’t ache anymore… but it’s a little swollen. My dear, why don’t you help me massage me?”

“You must be asking for a beating!”

Lil’ Purple’s face blushed as she eavesdropped. She thought it was finally ending, but the bridal chamber began to shake for another half a day before it stopped.

When Lin Yun and Su Ziyao came out of the bridal room, the petals fell onto the ground as Lin Yun walked out, looking energetic while donning the Azure Saint Cloth. But he looked somewhat exhausted, with beads of sweat on his forehead.

On the other hand, Su Ziyao’s face looked rosy when she walked out.

“Lin Yun, is it tiring?” Lil’ Purple asked, baffled. She said, “You possess the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.”

Su Ziyao’s face blushed when she said that while Lin Yun awkwardly smiled, “What does a child as you know?”

“What do you mean that I don’t know?” Lil’ Purple was furious and said, “I heard you saying that it’s aching, and you even got her to help massage you. But she’s not willing, and the two of you must’ve fought. After all, the chamber shook so violently.

Her voice was innocent, but what she said made even Lin Yun blush. He didn’t know how to explain to Lil’ Purple, but Su Ziyao looked at Lil’ Purple, and smiled, “There’s nothing impressive about the divine physique.”

Lil’ Purple instantly understood now, and she looked at Lin Yun, “It looks like you’re really weak to lose in a fight.”

Lin Yun was furious when she heard that. He wanted to say something, but he couldn’t say a word. He could only reply, “Who said that I lost? You’re a brat, so why are you asking so much?”

“Yeah, you didn’t lose. So don’t get angry,” Su Ziyao smiled as she tidied up Lin Yun’s clothes for him with a blissful smile.

Over the next few days, Lin Yun and Su Ziyao stayed on the island, carefreely spending their time together. They would cultivate by themselves during the day, and they would cultivate together at night.

Lil’ Purple brought Lil’ Red to the Divine Mulberry Tree, looking mysterious. Lin Yun plucked all the leaves from the Divine Blood Fruit. He initially wanted to share them with Su Ziyao, but the latter rejected them. Knowing that Su Ziyao didn’t lack treasures like that, Lin Yun didn’t say much about it.

Seven days later, Lin Yun was cultivating on the island with a heavenly dragon and divine phoenix coiling around him, and he had finally reached the ninth stage with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. When he opened his eyes, his aura began to climb as he divided himself into two, one executing the Divine Dragon Sword Score while the other cultivated the Godly Phoenix Sword Score. As the two auras combined, various terrifying phenomena began to bloom.

They cooperated as they fought individually. Looking from afar, it looked like two different people, both possessing a terrifying sword intent. This was the power of the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, and it would transform after reaching the ninth stage. This wasn’t just leaving behind two afterimages but reforging two bodies for himself with the Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix as the foundation, achieving multitasking.

When the two figures overlapped, a dragon roar and a phoenix cry echoed as the sword intent released from Lin Yun increased. The next moment, sword intent flowed into Lin Yun’s chest as he closed his eyes, and the sword ray he released was flawless. This was a terrifying sword intent that was flawless and dazzling.

In the next moment, all the plants on the island shone, and each grass looked as though they were clad in silver. As sword rays began to gather on Lin Yun, it felt as though everything in the world had turned into a sword this moment. This was a sign that Lin Yun was going to make a breakthrough in his sword intent, reaching the Divine Light Sword Intent.

Su Ziyao opened her eyes as she descended from a rock, looking at Lin Yun with her eyes shining with joy.

“Is the scumbag finally going to grasp the Divine Light Sword Intent?” Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red also rushed over with joy.

Lin Yun had long grasped the Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent and was only half a step away from the Divine Light Sword Intent. But to many people, this half-step was a huge gulf they might never be able to cross in their lifetime.

But after Lin Yun married, his mood improved, and he made swift progress in his sword intent and cultivation. After the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon reached the ninth stage, his sword intent would soon reach the Divine Light Sword Intent.

Lil’ Purple stood beside Su Ziyao, who had barely reached her waist height, looking like a mother and daughter pair. That was especially the case when Lil’ Purple stood beside Su Ziyao with her fists clenched nervously, looking adorable.

“Once he has achieved the Divine Light Sword Intent, his Sword Domain will also be smoothly formed,” Su Ziyao said. Grasping the Divine Light Sword Intent and Sword Domain might be tough for others, but it was as simple as drinking water for Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun had formed the Azure Dragon Sword Heart before grasping the Divine Light Sword Intent, a prototype version of a Sword Domain.

It could only be considered a Quasi-Sword Domain in the past, but it could be genuinely called the Azure Dragon Sword Domain now. If Lin Yun could grasp Nirvana Dao in the future, grasping the Nirvana Sword Intent would be a matter of time.

When Lin Yun finally opened his eyes, his eyes became cold with boundless sword intent in the depths of his eyes, with a powerful sword intent filling his body. This sword intent was unyielding, which made Lin Yun look like the owner of this world. The entire island was projected into Lin Yun’s mind with a single thought.

He finally noticed something unusual about the Divine Mulberry Tree. Golden flames were blazing in the tree, emitting a dazzling radiance. Lin Yun’s sword intent had reached a terrifying height with just one thought. He was calm as he held onto the Flower Burial Sword and felt that everything was connected to his sword heart.

“A resonation with the surroundings…” The resonation with the surroundings had taken a step further as Lin Yun brandished his sword, unleashing the Azure Dragon Sword Heart. In the past, the Azure Dragon Sword Heart was in the form of a silver domain.

He calmly stood with the Flower Burial Sword in his hand as everything began to shake. Lin Yun could achieve a resonance with the surroundings with every single movement. Most importantly, his sword intent felt endless and could fuse with heaven and earth.

Within the hundred feet of the silver domain, Lin Yun’s sword intent became even more terrifying; it made him look like a deity, and anyone would be terrified by just a glance from him. When he performed the Divine Firefly Sword, the four glory spirits in the Flower Burial Sword were activated, and the powerful aura made Lin Yun shocked.

“With the Azure Dragon Sword Domain, I can easily activate the four glory spirits now… and the sword domain has even fused into one with the Flower Burial Sword.” Lin Yun looked at the Flower Burial Sword in his hand with his eyes shining brightly.

When he brandished the Flower Burial Sword, it felt like he was swinging an entire sword domain down, and the powerful pressure he gave off could even easily suppress a third-stage Saint Lord. If he ran into the three fourth-stage Saint Lords again, even they wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.

The saint energy of a fourth-stage Saint Lord was like a sea. The reason why Lin Yun suffered before was because of the huge gap in their cultivation. After all, there was a huge difference in quality between saint energy and saint aura, not to mention that his opponents’ saint energy was massive, like a sea, unleashing great waves with a wave of their hand.

Back then, even his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent couldn’t do anything to them. He naturally fell into a disadvantageous position since he lost the advantage of his sword intent. As a result, he could only try and hold on with the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

“Sword Intent…” Lin Yun suddenly thought of something, and his eyes lit up.

“I see! Hahaha!” Lin Yun laughed as he plunged the Flower Burial Sword into his chest under Lil’ Purple and Su Ziyao’s exclamations. But the blood they were expecting didn’t splash out as light shone on Lin Yun’s chest. The Flower Burial Sword began to fuse with the Azure Dragon Sword Intent, and the sword soon entered his chest.

When the entire sword entered his chest, Lin Yun’s sword domain disappeared, and the golden light in his eyes also dissipated. This naturally startled Lil’ Purple and Su Ziyao, who looked at Lin Yun with shock.

“This is…” Lil’ Purple fell into deep thoughts because she found this familiar but couldn’t recall where she saw it.

“Don’t worry about it. I have grasped Sect Master Mu’s secrets now,” Lin Yun smiled. The first time he came in contact with the sword domain was when the Sword Sect’s sect master, Mu Xuankong, took action and it was shocking back then. He had hidden his sword for three years, and he could celebrate it being unsheathed with the blood of a Saint. He finally knew where Mu Xuankong hid his sword: in his heart.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Seeing that Su Ziyao was still bewildered, Lin Yun smiled as he held onto Su Ziyao’s hand. Under the unbelievable gaze, her hand entered his heart and slowly pulled the Flower Burial Sword out, unleashing a sword ray when it appeared with a powerful sword intent sweeping out. The sword aura was so powerful that it even caused the surrounding space to distort.

“That works?” Lil’ Purple was amazed. She fell into deep thoughts and said, “It requires one to have perfect compatibility with the sword, and this is unbelievable. I have heard of it before. I fathom that Mu Xuankong managed to do it after three hundred years, but you actually managed to do it so quickly.”

After seeing Su Ziyao draw out the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun smiled, “That’s Flower Burial we’re talking about!”

No matter what, he had grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent now, not to mention that he even unlocked the emergence of the Azure Dragon Sword Domain and Flower Burial Sword.
