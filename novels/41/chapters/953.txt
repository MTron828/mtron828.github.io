Chapter 954 - Strength

After all, Lin Yun had faced the dragon roar from the altar with a dragon roar from within his body. At this moment, Lin Yun had grown into a giant before everyone’s eyes. What made them even more shocked was the fact Lin Yun actually sent Liu Mu flying out with a punch.

Everyone from the higher realms was astounded and the faces of Bloodbone Realm’s elites were ugly. At this moment on the plaza, even the higher realms’ leaders couldn’t help having a change on their faces with tremendous shock in their hearts. As for Mo Yan and the rest who were holding up Lil’ Red, their eyes radiated with fear and no longer had the arrogance from before.

“Monarch fortune martial technique!” The five astral spirit’s owners all squinted their eyes with shock. Shortly after, their exclamation caused an uproar in the plaza with everyone looking at Lin Yun with disbelief.

“Monarch fortune martial technique? How is this possible? With his cultivation, it’s challenging enough to practise an overlord fortune martial technique. So how can he possibly learn a monarch fortune martial technique?”

“The power of that punch is indeed terrifying. The winged human behind him looked realistic and this isn’t a phenomenon that overlord fortune martial techniques can execute…”

“This is too unbelievable.” Although they knew that Lin Yun had grasped an advanced fortune martial technique, no one thought that it would be a monarch fortune martial technique. After all, that was someone that only the five astral spirits’ owners or those at the pyramid on the Azure Dragon Ranking could possess.

Aside from that, the five astral spirits’ owners also had some speculation in their hearts. There was a high possibility that Lin Yun had used divine astral pellets in his tribulation like them. Otherwise, there was no way they could explain why Lin Yun could defeat Liu Mu when he was only in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

After all, even if Lin Yun’s sword intent and cultivation technique was heaven-defying, there was no way he could complement the huge difference in their cultivation. So the only explanation would be that Lin Yun had refined a lot of divine astral pellets. On the other hand, Liu Mu only used ordinary astral pellets in his tribulation.

So there was no way the two could compete in the quality of their origin energy. Thinking about that, the five astral spirits’ owners looked at Lin Yun with additional light in their eyes. But if they knew how many divine astral pellets Lin Yun had, they probably wouldn’t be able to maintain their composure. They might even make a move at Lin Yun.

“This brat is interesting.” The Gloryfire Spirit’s owner smiled. The other four’s gaze had also become grave. In their eyes, Lin Yun was even more valuable than many higher realms’ leaders. After all, strength was more important in the Heavenly Path.

When Lin Yun descended from the sky, he looked at Liu Mu and wasn’t in a hurry to make his move. He could sense an eerie aura coming from Liu Mu which meant that Liu Mu must have some trump cards and wasn’t heavily injured by his attack. But there must be a reason since he wasn’t in a hurry to make his move.

For example, the five astral spirits’ owners. After all, even Lin Yun could feel a dangerous aura coming from them. If he had guessed it correctly, the five should be the same as him and had refined many divine astral pellets in their tribulation. Most importantly, they could even use their astral spirits in the critical moment to fight. So Lin Yun wasn’t confident that he could face them without using his sky sword intent.

But fortunately, they didn’t seem to be too interested in him. Then again, it also made sense since they had undergone an intense competition to obtain their astral spirits. This meant that their realms must have a terrifying accumulation and even possessed monarch fortune martial techniques.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, Lil’ Red also flew back to his shoulder while Mo Yan and the two higher realms’ elites rushed towards Liu Mu. Just like that, the confrontation fell into a stalemate.

“Liu Mu, looks like you need some help now.” An eerie smile sounded out right at this moment. The owner of the voice was Demonslaughter Realm’s leader, Xu Que. He was deeply interested in Lin Yun’s Glorysun Spirit and advanced fortune martial techniques right from the beginning. So when he saw that Liu Mu was injured now, his killing intent began to surge in his pupils once more.

He didn’t look down on Lin Yun but he knew that Lin Yun must’ve exhausted a lot of his origin energy from the battle. Lin Yun might even have suffered heavy injuries just that he had hidden it well.

“Get lost.” Just when everyone thought that Liu Mu was willing to accept help, Liu Mu cursed out instead. But very quickly, they instantly knew why he cursed out. After all, this was a humiliation of the Bloodbone Realm that they were left in such a pathetic state. So how could he possibly ask for help? Liu Mu said coldly, “This is the personal feud of my Bloodbone Realm and it has nothing to do with you.”

“Hehe. You don’t have a choice in this.” Xu Que grinned and dashed out. The moment he made his move, the other higher realms’ geniuses were also tempted to move. Although Lin Yun was strong, he was ultimately alone. So how much strength did he still have left after his battle with Liu Mu?

But everyone was surprised in the next second. Before Lin Yun even made his move, a robust figure stood out and unleashed his violent aura like a mountain before Lin Yun. Then, he clenched his fist and threw out a punch towards Xu Que which sent him flying back at an even faster speed.

“Wu Mu!” Everyone’s faces changed when they saw the newcomer. He was the Demonic Constellation Realm’s leader, Wu Mu.

“You’re here?” Lin Yun didn’t seem to be surprised with Wu Mu’s arrival and asked casually.

Nodding his head, Wu Mu replied, “I ran into some trouble in my fourth tribulation and this is why I’m late.”

When everyone heard Wu Mu and Lin Yun’s conversation, they were all shocked because the Demonic Constellation Realm seemed to have joined forces with Lin Yun. Suffering such a huge loss, Xu Que roared with his face ugly, “Wu Mu, you’re a leader of your higher realm. You want to be Lin Yun’s dog?!”RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Liu Mu and Mo Yan’s faces became nasty at this moment. With Wu Mu standing on Lin Yun’s side, it was now impossible for the two of their realms to take Lin Yun down.

In response to Xu Que, Wu Mu sneered, “That’s none of your business. At least I won’t take advantage of someone. If you dare, you can fight Lin Yun after he recovers and I won’t stop you. But I don’t think you have the courage to do that.”

Having salt rubbed on his wound, Xu Que’s face became even nastier. After all, it wasn’t exactly something glorious that he took advantage of Lin Yun when Lin Yun had just gone through a battle.

“Let’s put a period to this matter.” The Glorygold Spirit’s owner spoke out. “The Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm is opening soon. Leave your enmity in the forbidden realm. Otherwise, don’t blame us for bullying if you guys destroy the sacred altar.”

The Goldfire Spirit’s owner also smiled when he looked at Lin Yun, “Lin Yun, what do you think about that? There’s no need to rush your feud with the Bloodbone Realm. If you guys fight here, you guys will only benefit others.”

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed because he had no idea what these people were thinking. He had no good opinion about the higher realms, and these people would’ve stepped out if they really wanted to stop the fight. So he guessed that they must be worried that the altar would be destroyed in the process.

After all, his punch earlier had left some cracks on the altar. Aside from that, they probably still had the intention to express their goodwill. After all, it would be impossible for the higher realms to gang up on him again when the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm opens. But it was a pity that they were too late.

Lin Yun smiled, “I have no opinion about that. But I won’t be afraid of anyone who dares to come at me.”

It would be somewhat troublesome for him to kill Liu Mu and Mo Yan without using his sky sword intent. Since they were thoroughly embarrassed now, he didn’t mind stopping here since he didn’t suffer any loss. He knew that Liu Mu must feel even more terrible than him right now.

Facing Lin Yun’s arrogant words, the plaza fell into silence. This time, no one dared to look at Lin Yun in his eyes especially after witnessing Lin Yun’s fight with Liu Mu. As for Liu Mu and Mo Yan, their faces had already turned pale.

“Alright. Let’s stop here then,” said the Gloryfire Spirit before Liu Mu and Mo Yan could even say a word. He had completely disregarded their thoughts which nearly drove them crazy. But they didn’t dare to utter a word as strength was the right of speech in the Heavenly Path.

Lin Yun had already won over everyone with his strength, so there was nothing they could do about it but to suck it up.
