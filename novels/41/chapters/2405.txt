Chapter 2406 - Who Can Fight Me?

The sword ray soaring to the sky shocked everyone. But they soon stretched their necks, wanting to see what had happened.

A sword ray and a palm clashed on the stage, unleashing a horrifying power. Followed by a massive explosion, the two attacks separated as a powerful vortex enveloped that entire region. The only thing they could confirm was that the sword ray didn’t take a step back.

Wasn’t Lin Yun a swordsman? Everyone’s faces changed as a horrifying thought appeared in their mind. When everything settled, they saw that it was Jiang Yi who was sent flying away.

Jiang Yi took a few steps back before he managed to stabilize himself with shock in his eyes. He was also bleeding from his palm.

When the sword ray dissipated, Lin Yun’s figure was revealed on the stage. While wielding the Flower Burial Sword, he said, “I already said that you can just come at me. There’s no need to target Heaven’s Gate.”

Not far from him, Feng Bumao’s forehead was sweaty, and he looked nervous and shocked.

“Big Brother Lin, are you alright?” Yue Weiwei asked.

“I’m fine. Weiwei, you can leave with the holy son first,” Lin Yun said as everyone helped Feng Bumao down the stage.

Feng Yuan and Bai Yuchen turned their attention over. They knew Jiang Yi’s strength well. If the full power of the Great Phaseless Divine Art was unleashed, it was easy for him to kill someone with higher cultivation, so their gazes became grave when they witnessed the clash between Lin Yun and Jiang Yi.

“You seem to have a lot of opinions about swordsmen?” Lin Yun said as he took a few steps forth, shocking everyone present. No one expected that Lin Yun, whom Jiang Yi looked down on, would manage to injure Jiang Yi. Can it be that Lin Yun still has trump cards?

The morale of the Heaven’s Gate also changed.

“It looks like we still have to rely on Flower Burial in the critical moment.”

“Lin Yun must still have trump cards.”

“Who said that swordsmen aren’t strong? Lin Yun is the strongest swordsman!” Everyone looked excited, especially the surrounding swordsmen.

When Dugu Jue heard the surrounding discussions, he smiled bitterly because Lin Yun used him as a sparring partner in their fight and wasn’t serious.

Jiang Yi’s body surged with a golden radiance, and he smiled, “Don’t misunderstand. I have no opinion against a swordsman, I only have an opinion against those trash who use a sword, calling themselves swordsmen. Such as someone who seems fond of launching a sneak attack.”

Lin Yun took a few more glances at Jiang Yi’s forehead, the Myriad Phase Divine Eye. The Great Phaseless Divine Art formed this, and he could also achieve something similar with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, such as the cauldron in his violet palace. But he rarely used the cauldron since it was taxing, and the murderous intent would corrupt him. But he was confident that the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon wasn’t inferior to the Great Phaseless Divine Art, not to mention he still had the Great Profound Sword Canon.

Lin Yun recollected his gaze, and said, “The Great Phaseless Divine Art is strong, but don’t be too reliant on it and neglect dao itself. Even if you managed to defeat your opponents for the time being, there’s not much meaning in it since dao is always the king!”

His tone was calm, and he even gave Jiang Yi pointers before the fight. This made everyone feel weird, as though Lin Yun never considered Jiang Yi as someone on the same level as him.

Jiang Yi mocked, “You’re teaching me how to cultivate? Even the so-called ‘Kunlun Realm’ is just a barbaric realm. The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity is long gone, so who still remembers Kunlun Realm? Do you really think that you can reforge Kunlun Realm’s glory?”

“Well, it’s not impossible to reforge Kunlun Realm’s glory,” Lin Yun said.

“Ha!” Jiang Yi sneered.

Lin Yun stopped speaking as they faced off with their auras clashing, soon creating various terrifying phenomena. Suddenly, they simultaneously made a move as they fought one another, sending out a powerful shockwave.

As Jiang Yi fought, he circulated the Great Phaseless Divine Art and was enveloped in a golden holy radiance, which formed into a golden domain as the Buddhist chant overlapped.

“Aside from the Myriad Phaseless Divine Eye, the Great Phaseless Divine Art can devour everything in the world, and my sword intent is being devoured.” Lin Yun was shocked that his sword intent was slowly depleting, and Jiang Yi’s domain was suppressing his Azure Dragon Sword Domain. It was no wonder why Yan Xiu lost so terribly.

“Let me see what other things you can devour! Azure Dragon’s Claw!” Lin Yun circulated his bloodline and poured the Azure Dragon Intent into the Flower Burial Sword. The Azure Dragon Sword Domain changed as a massive dragon’s claw descended from the sky when he raised his sword. As the claw streaked across the sky, a terrifying thunderstorm was gathering.

When the sword ray and punch collided, a dragon’s roar first resounded before a cracking sound followed.

“I can’t devour it?” Jiang Yi squinted during the fight, realizing that the devouring effect of his Great Phaseless Divine Art seemed to have failed. He had been devouring Lin Yun’s sword intent earlier; however, Lin Yun’s sword intent didn’t decline, but rose instead. He could faintly see a massive power being accumulated, and Lin Yun’s sword intent would replenish itself whenever he devoured some of it.

“You’re stronger than Yan Xiu. I’m becoming serious.” Jiang Yi retreated and hovered in the air.

“It looks like there’s nothing impressive about the Great Phaseless Divine Art,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“A frog in a well!” Jiang Yi sneered as the eye on his forehead began to blaze. As golden flames enveloped him, golden flames started to gather as his physique broke through a certain limit. He was like a buddha from the legend as the aura he gave off became powerful. “If you can take this move, you’re qualified to fight me!”

Jiang Yi roared as his golden flames began to rise. Before he unleashed his attack, the aura he gave off already left terrifying cracks on the stage.

This left everyone in the surroundings dumbfounded as the stage only shook briefly, and it had never trembled so violently. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“How terrifying is the Great Phaseless Divine Art?”

“Jiang Yi’s aura has broken through the restriction of the Quasi-Saint Sovereign. This is unbelievable.”

“It’ll be hard for Lin Yun to withstand this attack with his cultivation as an eighth-stage Saint Lord.”

“The divine son of the Shadow Divine Palace was already terrifying, not to mention that he had the Great Phaseless Divine Art. Without a Sovereign Saint Artifact, who could rival him?” Seeing such a terrifying phenomenon, everyone was dumbfounded.

“Let me see how you die!” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son laughed upon seeing this.

“Fuck!” Profound Sky Venerable was furious because Jiang Yi was too much. Before he was in this state, no sword technique could do anything to him, which was equivalent to cheating.

Even Luo Tianxi frowned, knowing how dangerous this fight was. But Lin Yun looked excited with his hand trembling. He wasn’t afraid but excited!

The Flower Burial Sword also trembled and was even more excited than him. Lin Yun lowered his head at the Flower Burial Sword, and gave it a gentle look. He said, “You understand me the best.”

Lin Yun took a deep breath. He held the Flower Burial Sword in reverse and slowly lowered his right hand. In the next second, a powerful sword vibration was heard from him as a dazzling radiance was released from his forehead. With a wave of his hand, the Flower Burial Sword was pointed to the sky with his sword intent exploding.

The sky stabilized by Luo Tianxi was easily shattered as boundless starlight shone onto Lin Yun. Cracks appeared on the ground, and they spread to a hundred feet within Lin Yun before they couldn’t spread any further. Lin Yun relied on his sword intent to resist the Saint Sovereign’s aura being released by Jiang Yi.

Feng Yuan and Bai Yuchen exchanged a gaze with shock in their eyes. “Bright Sun Sword Intent!”

This was the first time Lin Yun released his complete Bright Sun Sword Intent.

“How is that possible...?” Feng Bumao was shocked with disbelief. Even the other disciples of the ancestral deity became dumbfounded.

“It’s the genuine Bright Sun Sword Intent!” The already despaired Profound Sky Venerable smiled, “Holy shit! He really hid himself deeply! Hahaha!”

Even Luo Tianxi couldn’t help commenting after a brief shock, “Holy shit!”
