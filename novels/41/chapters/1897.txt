Chapter 1898 - Arrogant

Zhang Yue might have room for maneuvering if he kept his mouth shut. But if he speaks, he would instantly become a laughingstock. What was he going to say? Was he going to say that Bai Shuying asked him out, and he was overtaken by his desires?VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“What did Zhang Yue do?”

“There must be something fishy about this…”

“Interesting… This is getting more interesting.” Everyone’s interest was piqued when they saw that Zhang Yue wasn’t willing to say anything under the pressure of two Saint Elders.

Lin Yun also covered his mouth, restraining his laughter. When he swept his gaze around and saw the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s party, his eyes lit up, and his gaze became playful. After he lowered his head, the corner of his lips rose. This was because he saw a familiar figure amongst the crowd, Bai Shuying.

She still looked heroic and elegant, giving others a feeling that she didn’t belong to the mortal world.

“Senior Brother, your eyes are sharp. I didn’t notice that the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden was already here,” Chen Feng chuckled.

Lin Yun coughed and quickly retracted his gaze.

“Senior Brother, what do you think Zhang Yue was trying to do?” Chen Feng asked curiously.

“Who knows?” Lin Yun replied with a playful smile.

Right then, the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign gave Zhang Yue another slap on his face, sending Zhang Yue flying away with the other half of his face swelling up. The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign was furious, seeing that Zhang Yue was still unwilling to speak. “What did you do last night? Speak!”

“Master, I really have my difficulties. I will tell you about it when we return, so please help me!” Zhang Yue said in a sobbing tone, and gave the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign three kowtows with blood dripping down his forehead.

This scene made the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s heart soft, and he suggested, “Serene Dust Great Saint, why don’t I bring him back with me first? I swear that I will give the Profound Maiden Courtyard an explanation. After all, Zhang Yue is my disciple.”

“So what if he’s your disciple? This incident occurred before the Profound Maiden Courtyard, and everyone within the Heavenly Dao Sect already knows about this. If he doesn’t make it clear today, there might be rumors revolving around my Profound Maiden Courtyard in the future!” The Serene Dust Great Saint said.

The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s face sank because the Serene Dust Great Saint didn’t give him any face. If Zhang Yue could talk about it, he would’ve done so long ago.

“Do me this favor and consider me owing you one,” the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign said, suppressing the fury within his heart. This was equivalent to him lowering his head.

The Serene Dust Great Saint suddenly smiled, “Tu You, did you know that this disciple of yours humiliated my disciple in public at the conferring ceremony yesterday? I have already given you face by not killing him!”

The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign became speechless, and he turned to look at Zhang Yue. He knew why the Serene Dust Great Saint wasn’t letting him go. It turned out that the Serene Dust Great Saint was taking revenge for her disciple, and this hopeless disciple of his just had to offend the Serene Dust Great Saint out of everyone else.

“Serene Dust Great Saint, I have already acknowledged my mistake. I didn’t mean what I said yesterday, and I have no intentions of humiliating the Profound Maiden,” Zhang Yue apologized.

“You don’t have to apologize to me, but speak about what happened last night,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said.

“This…” Zhang Yue’s forehead was covered in sweat. He didn’t know where to start and noticed that Bai Shuying was amongst the crowd.

“I know what happened last night!” Right then, a voice echoed from the crowd, and everyone turned their gazes over.

“Ye Qingtian!” Everyone was shocked when they looked at the one who spoke.

They weren’t surprised that Ye Qingtian would be here. After all, everyone within the Heavenly Dao Sect knows about the feud between Zhang Yue and Ye Qingtian, not to mention that they nearly fought at the conferring ceremony last night.

But no one expected Ye Qingtian to be daring enough to stand out at this moment, even claiming that he knew what happened last night. This instantly caused an uproar, and everyone looked at Ye Qingtian in doubt, wondering if he really knew what had happened last night. But how could Ye Qingtian know about it when Zhang Yue wasn’t willing to say?

When Lin Yun stepped forth, the crowd split apart and opened a path for him.

“Ye Qingtian, get lost!” Zhang Yue roared. He was on the verge of collapsing because Ye Qingtian was nothing in his eyes before. Back then, Ye Qingtian practically crawled out of the Heavenly Dao Sect after nearly breaking all of Ye Qingtian’s dragon pulses. So he never expected that Ye Qingtian would dare to stand out at this moment. This naturally made him furious, and he was on the verge of losing control.

“Let him speak!” The Serene Dust Great Saint said, suppressing Zhang Yue and immobilizing him.

“Ye Qingtian pays his greetings to two Seniors.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together.

“You know what happened last night?” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign coldly questioned. “Ye Qingtian, I have heard of you before. If you dare to slander my disciple, not even the Azure River Sword Saint will be able to save you.”

“I naturally don’t dare to slander him. Both of you know what happened to him last night, it’s just that everyone has overlooked it,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Oh? Go on,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said.

Lin Yun’s words instantly piqued everyone’s interest, and he smiled, “It’s simple. Isn’t it written on his back? ‘I’m sinful and shouldn’t have peeked on the Dragon Origin Great Saint showering.’ Since it’s written that he peeked at the Dragon Origin Great Saint showering, we just have to ask the Dragon Origin Great Saint if it’s true.”

“Hahaha!”

“Judging from how Zhang Yue isn’t willing to speak about it, it might really be true.”

“I wouldn’t dare to talk about it if I was in his position. After all, it’s too humiliating.”

“Haha, Ye Qingtian is really a talent. He was humiliated by Zhang Yue yesterday, and it seems that he’s determined to pay it back.” Everyone was briefly stunned before they laughed.

Zhang Yue was panicky while wearing his clothes, and he immediately lost it when he heard what Lin Yun said. He roared, “Ye Qingtian, how dare you!”

He immediately charged towards Lin Yun, but he had lost his rationale, and naturally wouldn’t be able to fight against Lin Yun.

Lin Yun simply kicked Zhang Yue and sent him flying back, rolling on the ground, and stopping after he smashed against the tree.

“Ye Qingtian, how dare you hurt my disciple! Are you courting death?!” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign became furious. But just when he wanted to teach Lin Yun a lesson, a jade bottle fell from Zhang Yue’s body.

When Zhang Yue saw the jade bottle, he instantly panicked and wanted to retrieve the jade bottle. But it was already too late. The Serene Dust Great Saint seized it with a wave of her hand.

“Return it to me…” Zhang Yue anxiously said, wanting to seize the jade bottle back.

The Serene Dust Great Saint knocked him away with a wave. When she saw the name on the jade bottle, her face changed. Even Ye Xinyan covered her mouth when she saw the name on the jade bottle from the side.

This scene made the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s heartthrob, and he said, “Serene Dust Great Saint, what is that?”

“Look at it yourself.” The Serene Dust Great Saint tossed the jade bottle over.

When the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign caught the jade bottle, the two Quasi-Saints beside him also looked over. When they saw the name on the jade bottle, their faces changed.

The faces of the two Quasi-Saints became pale, and they turned to look at Zhang Yue in shock. They exclaimed, “The Sky Pillar Pellet!”

Everyone was first stunned before their faces changed. Everyone naturally knew what it was for, and it was only effective for men. All the faces of the female disciples present also turned red, and they sent weird looks at Zhang Yue.

On the contrary, Zhang Yue’s face sank, and he sat on the ground.

Lin Yun couldn’t hold back his laughter, and raised his head, “Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign, your disciple brought the Sky Pillar Pellet with him to peek at the Dragon Origin Great Saint showering. Is it because he thinks he’s not hard enough? It looks like he’s a little arrogant.”

The solemn atmosphere changed upon hearing what Lin Yun said, and everyone burst out laughing. Many female disciples also began to laugh, and their laughter grew even louder as time passed.

The peals of laughter made the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s face pale, and he began to tremble from the anger.
