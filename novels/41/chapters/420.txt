Chapter 421 - Final Training

Lin Yun had considered the consequences for his actions, but the doubt tickling his heart had been accumulating and had reached the point where he needed an answer. Otherwise, he would never feel at peace.

But in the next second, the shock disappeared in the princess’ eyes and her gaze became deep and unfathomable. Without even moving her body, her hand reached out and grabbed onto Lin Yun’s wrist tightly.

“What speed!” Lin Yun was shocked. He never expected that the princess was so fast. Shaking his wrist, Lin Yun broke free of the princess’ grip while he retreated before dashing for her veil once again. His movements left behind afterimages and it was difficult to differentiate which was the real Lin Yun.

“Are you done?” The princess’ eyes flashed coldly and her hand reached out. Her hand shattered Lin Yun’s afterimages before grabbing onto his wrist. But before she could tighten her grip, Lin Yun’s hand began to vibrate and he slipped out of the princess’ grip.

The coldness Lin Yun felt from the princess’ hand made him shocked as he took several steps back. He knew that the princess was furious and that the consequences would be dire if he continued any longer, but he also didn’t want to give up right now. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Making his decision, Lin Yun activated the Golden Crow Seal. He spread his arms apart and soared into the sky at lightning speed. He reached the princess in the blink of an eye and he could feel that he had grabbed onto the princess’ veil.

But just when he was about to pass by, his face changed because the veil was a little too big. It was even fluttering in the wind. When he lowered his head to look at the cloth in his hand, his face changed because it was the princess’ clothes.

This instantly made him awkward. So it turns out that when he passed by the princess, the princess tilted her head to avoid his grab, which led to him grabbing on her collar instead. Everything happened too quickly and he was now placed in this sticky situation by the time he recovered.

The princess did not panic nor was she furious. But her eyes were cold as she asked, “Are you done?”

Lin Yun was startled awake and quickly turned his head away. “I’m sorry. I wasn’t doing it on purpose. Please forgive my sins.”

Lin Yun was feeling depressed. He wouldn’t believe his words if he was in the princess’ shoes as he looked at the clothes in his hand. However, he was surprised because the princess wasn’t furious, nor was she emitting any killing aura.

Just when he was feeling doubtful, the princess finally spoke up, “Prepare well for the Dragon Gate Competition. If you’re not able to become the champion, you can’t even get close to me, not to mention removing my veil.”

The princess then jumped into the sky and a crane dove down. The princess stood on the crane firmly before the crane disappeared into the horizon. Lin Yun looked at the princess’ silhouette disappearing from his sights before lowering his head at the clothes again.

Right at this moment, footsteps sounded out that disrupted his trail of thoughts. When the two saw that the princess was nowhere seen, they asked, “Where’s Her Highness?”

But when their eyes fell onto the clothes in Lin Yun’s hand, the doubt in their eyes grew even denser.

“That’s the princess’ clothes!” exclaimed Li Wuyou.

“Junior Brother, what’s going on?” questioned Xin Yan.

Seeing that even Xin Yan was feeling suspicious, Lin Yun smiled bitterly and told them what just happened. His story left the two of them shocked and Li Wuyou smiled, “Big Brother, I really admire you. You even dared to strip the princess.”

But Xin Yan, who usually has a habit of teasing Lin Yun, suddenly wore a grave expression, “Junior Brother, are you certain that you didn’t feel any killing aura from the princess?”

“I am.” Lin Yun recalled what had transpired and he was sure that he didn’t sense any killing aura from her.

Xin Yan finally let out a breath of relief and said, “Junior Brother, don’t be so impulsive in the future. The princess isn’t as simple as you think, nor is she someone easy to talk with. She’s…”

Xin Yan tried, but she wasn’t able to find any word to describe the princess.

“What kind of person is she?” asked Lin Yun.

Xin Yan pondered for a long time before she spoke out, “I felt it when I knew her back then. She might be close to you, but whenever she speaks with you, it’ll feel like she’s speaking to you from the sky. When you’re beside her, you can always feel a chill coming from her. I can’t see through her… Putting it in a nutshell, she’s a dangerous person and even the crown prince is fearful of her. It doesn’t matter if the princess looks at you in a different light, keep in mind that we’re not from the same world.”

“I thought that only I felt it. So you also feel the same, Senior Sister. The princess is truly unfathomable. I feel an unknown sense of anxiety whenever I stand beside her,” smiled Li Wuyou embarrassedly.

“I know that,” sighed Lin Yun. “But she looks like an acquaintance of mine.”

“She shouldn’t be. It has been five years since she last appeared, but the chances of her leaving the Great Qin Empire aren’t high. Even if she left, that only means that she went to someone even more powerful than the Great Qin Empire,” said Xin Yan.

Did I recognize the wrong person? Lin Yun looked at the hair coiled around his finger and pondered things deeply. In the end, he gave up thinking about it.

Right at this moment, a figure bolted over. When everyone took a closer look at that person, they were all shocked. They never imagined that Bai Lixuan actually came to the Extermination Mountain Range as well. But it wasn’t surprising when they thought about it.

Bai Lixuan didn’t have to go into seclusion and fighting with Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts in the Extermination Mountain Range was an efficient way to increase his strength even further before the start of the Dragon Gate Competition.

Clearly, Bai Lixuan descended because he saw Lin Yun. His aura was stronger than before and time was always on his side with the Saint Physique. But he wasn’t satisfied with his current strength and wanted to train himself even further in the Extermination Mountain Range. Someone like him was terrifying. He was a madman with a perverse pursuit for strength.

When Bai Lixuan looked at Lin Yun, the killing aura in his eyes couldn’t be concealed. Lin Yun had already become a demon in his heart that he had to kill before leaving the Great Qin Empire. Otherwise, it would plague him for the rest of his life. This meant that his future was limited even with the Saint Physique.

“Bai Lixuan, what are you trying to do?” Xin Yan frowned her eyebrows.

“Don’t worry, I won't touch him before the Dragon Gate Competition.” Bai Lixuan looked at Lin Yun coldly and continued, “Many people say that you won’t participate in this Dragon Gate Competition, but I hope that you remember what you said. Our enmity will be resolved in the Dragon Gate Competition, so don’t cower.”

Bai Lixuan then turned into a bolt of lightning and entered the Extermination Mountain Range. Lin Yun, Xin Yan, and Li Wuyou could sense a sword aura charging through the Extermination Mountain Range without any hesitation. Clearly, Bai Lixuan’s objective must be the core of the mountain range because Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts could be found there!

A cold smirk rose on Lin Yun’s lips and he muttered, “It looks like a lot of people want to take my life in the Dragon Gate Competition.”

Xin Yan’s face changed and she spoke quickly, “Junior Brother, this Bai Lixuan feels even more terrifying than before. It feels as if he can step into the tenth stage at any time. Even worse, that’s not the end of his potential.”

“That’s the power of the Saint Physique.” Lin Yun nodded, “I wouldn’t be surprised even if he reached the quasi-Violet Palace Realm before the Dragon Gate Competition.”

Fighting spirit blazed in Lin Yun’s heart. He wasn’t afraid of the challenge. Bai Lixuan had his advantage with the Saint Physique, but Lin Yun also had his. Everyone thought that he had revealed all his trump cards, but people seem to have forgotten that he possessed the three strongest martial techniques in the Great Qin Empire. He was walking an unprecedented path. He was someone who created legends, so how could his potential already be met?

“It’s getting late and I should get going. As for the matter with the princess, please keep it a secret for me,” said Lin Yun.

“Be careful. Wuyou and I will wait for you at the Dragon Gate Competition,” said Xin Yan in a concerned tone.

“Big Brother, I’ll be waiting for you. Make everyone who doubted you eat their words,” added Li Wuyou.

Under their gaze, Lin Yun summoned the Dragon Blooded Horse and disappeared into the Extermination Mountain Range.
