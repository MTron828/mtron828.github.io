Chapter 538 - Prelude

“This is the power of the Seven Slaughtering Fist?” Lin Yun became emotional from what just occurred. This power was even stronger than his Heavenly Cloud Shatter. This meant that he now had another trump card in addition to the Thunderbolt Crusher. One must know that the Seven Slaughtering Seal was a fist technique that he had only reached initial mastery in.

Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how powerful it would become when he reached greater mastery. The Seven Slaughtering Fist was truly worthy of being known as a forbidden technique.

“There’s still time left before the competition.” Lin Yun held onto his chin as he fell into deep thought. If he could practice the Thunderbolt Crusher to its peak, then there would be nothing to fear in the competition when paired with his Iris Sword Array.

“The Thunderbolt Crusher is only the first move in the Overlord Sword. I basically swing my sword like a thunderbolt, but now I have to focus on the aura of this move…” Lin Yun reached out and grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword that shot out of the sword box.

In the next moment, his sword intent mimicked the aura of rumbling lightning that echoed out in the sky. A boundless aura started to release from Lin Yu, and thunderclouds began to gather in the sky. When the momentum reached its pinnacle, Lin Yun drew his sword.

In that split second, a sword ray shot out from his body. When the rumbling noise reached its pinnacle, the Flower Burial Sword began to shine with dazzling lightning flickering like a ferocious beast. When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, there was a crack that stretched for a few hundred meters on the stage that was reinforced by an array. The momentum coming from Lin Yun was shocking.

The stage was reinforced by a spiritual array, so even a pinnacle Yin stage would have a great difficulty tearing such a huge crack on the ground. However, despite this, Lin Yun wasn’t satisfied. “The thunderbolt momentum is still too weak. I still have to comprehend it more if I want to bring it to perfection.”

Within Yang Xiong’s courtyard, he was also training himself like Lin Yun. Two figures were currently fighting Yang Xiong on the stage. His opponents were two greater Yin stage core disciples. Their cultivation wasn't any weaker than Gu Feng’s, but there was nothing they could do when they faced Yang Xiong.

Yang Xiong frowned, “Infernalthunder Solar Radiation!”

Lightning began to crackle on Yang Xiong as it formed a lump of infernalthunder that enveloped him. The terrifying aura was enough to send his two opponents flying, but Yang Xiong didn’t stop there and threw his palm out.

This made the two throw up a mouthful of blood as they fell onto the ground. Shock was in their eyes as they exclaimed, “Senior Brother Yang, your Infernalthunder Art reached the seventh stage?”

“You can say that,” replied Yang Xiong.

The two core disciples were shocked because the Infernalthunder Art was one of the best cultivation techniques among earth grade cultivation techniques. Furthermore, it was extremely domineering. It wasn’t easy to cultivate and it had a total of nine stages. Reaching the seventh stage was the same as reaching complete mastery.

This meant that Yang Xiong had gone easy on them. They couldn’t be bothered with their injuries as they said in a respectful tone, “Congratulations, Senior Brother Yang.”

“I’m certain you are comparable to the top ten with your current strength. Why don’t you fight for it?”

Yang Xiong smiled, “There’s nothing except fame in the top ten. If my information is right, there will be a flower king in this competition.”

Normally, Profound Yin Flowers only had six petals. Seven petals could be considered exquisite, while eight petals were rare. As for nine petals, those flowers were called flower kings. It had been decades since a Profound Yin Flower with nine petals was born. Since none of the top ten core disciples were participating in the competition, Yang Xiong was confident that he could obtain it.

“I’ve accumulated my strength for five years. If I can obtain this flower king, I can reach the Yang stage directly. At that time, even Mei Ziyan will be nothing in my eyes. I might even be able to put up a fight in the Draconic Banquet a year from now,” said Yang Xiong.

The two core disciples were shocked by those words. They never expected that Yang Xiong had planned so far.

“Is there any news about that brat?” asked Yang Xiong.

“Hehe, Senior Brother, we have already spread the news throughout the academy according to your request. Everyone knows that you’re going to target him in the competition.”

“But that brat is really a coward. He has been locking himself up,” said the two core disciples.

“Coward?” Yang Xiong smiled with disdain, “It’s not fun that way. I’m looking forward to seeing his strength.”

He made the two core disciples to spread the news in order to force Lin Yun to attend. If Lin Yun didn’t come, then he would be greatly humiliated. But that didn’t matter because his reputation would be destroyed in the academy if that was the case. In the future, when he reached the Yang stage, he would have plenty of time to deal with Lin Yun. He had always been someone that kept his words.

Since Lin Yun had completely disregarded him, Yang Xiong’s eyes were flashing with killing aura. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The next morning when the first glimpse of dawn appeared, the academy bustled with excitement as the inner disciples looked at the summit of the Spiritwood Peak. The summit was a forbidden ground to inner disciples. But today, they could also enjoy the precious Profound Yin Spiritual Essence. If they were lucky enough, they might even be able to obtain a Profound Yin Flower.

But even if they failed to obtain a Profound Yin Flower, the Profound Yin Spiritual Essence alone was enough for them. Additionally, the competition was a great place for them to shine and prove themselves. If they had a good performance, they could even be taken in by elders as disciples.

It made sense that the summit would be filled with people. There was a long queue and Yang Xiong looked at this scene with disdain. The inner disciples were just side characters in this competition. After all, the protagonists have always been the core disciples, so many of them looked at the inner disciples with mockery on their faces.

A man and woman were waiting outside Lin Yun’s courtyard anxiously. The man was naturally Gong Ming. His aura was a lot stronger, which meant that his cultivation had improved. The other was Bai Yi. She had found Lin Yun’s place after expending great effort.

“Did you guys think that Lin Yun would show up?” Mockery sounded out as Bai Yi and Gong Ming both turned around. When they saw Gu Teng and Gu Feng, their faces changed. The two of them had been greatly terrified ever since they were humiliated by Lin Yun. So they didn’t even dare to see Lin Yun, not to mention making trouble for him.

But over the past few days, there was news that Yang Xiong would teach Lin Yun a lesson if Lin Yun dared to appear in the competition. Yang Xiong was the strongest outside of the top ten, so Gu Feng knew about his strength well. He even knew that Yang Xiong’s true strength wasn’t any inferior to the top ten.

Although Gu Feng had no idea how Lin Yun offended Yang Xiong, he knew that this was an opportunity for him to step on Lin Yun. If he could accomplish it, then he would change his reputation in the academy. So he naturally wouldn’t give up on such an opportunity.

“Big Brother Lin will definitely show up,” said Bai Yi seriously.

“Sure, if he wants to court death… He might be strong, but he’s nothing compared to the true experts of the academy. In the end, trash is still trash,” said Gu Teng.

“Did the two of you forget how you both kneeled a few days ago?” Gong Ming smiled, “What would you be if Lin Yun was a piece of trash?”

Upon mentioning what happened back in the Infernal Plaza, Gu Feng and Gu Teng’s faces both became ugly.

“We’ll wait and see then. If he has the guts, then he wouldn’t be hiding right now. If he turns up, then I’ll deal with him myself!” said Gu Feng as he glared at Gong Ming before he left. In the end, he was still afraid that Lin Yun would show up since this was Lin Yun’s residence.
