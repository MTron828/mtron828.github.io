Chapter 1907 - Tasteless Wine

Riding on the Celestial Crane, Lin Yun soared to the sky toward the second level of the Celestial Purging Mountain. He was bored throughout the journey, so he calculated his harvest. He had obtained over two hundred Heavenly Cloud Fruits.

“Sorry about that,” Lin Yun sighed, before taking a fruit and tossing it into his mouth. The Heavenly Cloud Fruit was sweet, and the taste was heavenly. The Heavenly Cloud Fruit filled his mouth with a fragrance when he swallowed it. But the satisfaction lasted briefly because he had swallowed the Heavenly Cloud Fruit after two bites, which wasn’t satisfying enough.

Lin Yun could sense a warm current flowing throughout his limbs before moving towards his forehead. Aside from that, he couldn’t feel any other changes. The Heavenly Cloud Fruits might be precious, but the effect wasn’t that obvious.

“It’s pretty tasty as a snack,” Lin Yun smiled. He didn’t dwell on it for long and continued to shove more Heavenly Cloud Fruits into his mouth. If someone else saw this scene, their jaws would probably drop.

“I have to admit that it’s pretty tasty,” Lin Yun smiled. He already ate over fifty Heavenly Cloud Fruits before he knew it. It was delicious, and he was a little addicted to the taste. He finished all the Heavenly Cloud Fruits when he came to the second level. After he finished, he licked his lips and was still lingering in the taste.

“It doesn’t look the same.” Lin Yun examined the towering mountain ahead of him. Far away, a person was standing there, dazing off as he stared at the sky with a complicated gaze.

When he stepped forth, he realized that this person was the grey-robed youth who he encountered earlier. This person also had nether energy within his body, but their nether energy was completely different.

“What are you doing here?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

The grey-clothed youth was still looking at the sky, as he said, “Two peerless beauties of the Heavenly Dao Sect passed by here earlier. One was the holy maiden of my Nether Orchid Courtyard. But she’s young, and I have never seen her before. But the other one should be the holy maiden of the Heavenly Yin Palace.”

“So?”

“They didn’t even glance at me. It was as though I’m invisible,” the grey-clothed youth said. He could also be considered a peerless genius and had long become a saint’s disciple. But he was nothing in the eyes of the two holy maidens. Not only the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, even the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden only glanced at him and left.

Lin Yun smiled because he didn’t notice that this youth was so narcissistic. “Brother, don’t dwell on two trees when there’s a whole forest. You’re so handsome, and I believe there will be a woman who falls for you.”

“I don’t like them. I only like the holy maiden or even Profound Maiden Miao Yin would also work,” the grey-clothed youth said in a stubborn tone. But he soon spoke in a depressed tone, “They all don’t like me, and I’m destined to be lonely for the rest of my life. I only have my sword as my company, and you won’t understand my loneliness.”

It took great difficulty for Lin Yun to bear his laughter, before he said, “Actually, you don’t have to be lonely.”

“What do you mean?” The grey-clothed youth turned to look at Lin Yun. He asked, “You have a solution?”

“You can give men a try,” Lin Yun said.

When the grey-clothed youth heard what Lin Yun said, he examined Lin Yun before turning indifferently around. “Please stay away from me.”

Lin Yun burst into laughter because this grey-clothed youth was pretty interesting. He was interested in the nether energy in this youth and wanted to know what was going on. So he quickly followed behind this grey-clothed youth and tried to pick a topic to discuss.

But the grey-clothed youth was indifferent and had no intentions of taking another look at Lin Yun. He could tell Lin Yun wasn’t simple and thought he was an expert from the two palaces and three courtyards. But after he knew that Lin Yun wasn’t from the two palaces and three courtyards, he no longer took another gaze at him because he felt that they weren’t from the same world, not to mention that Lin Yun’s cultivation was too low. Even so, he was polite and didn’t say anything nasty, albeit his emotions were all written on his face.

This made Lin Yun feel helpless because this person was tough to deal with. He considered whether to display his strength or spar with the grey-clothed youth.

Suddenly, he felt a burning pain in his stomach, and the two hundred Heavenly Cloud Fruits he ate turned into a golden aura, wreaking havoc within his body. It felt as though his entire body had become a cauldron, and even his forehead felt burning.

Shortly after, Lin Yun’s dragon origin also rapidly began to surge and rise. When Lin Yun felt terrible, he let out a loud and long fart. When he let out the fart, he felt more relieved.

The loud fart made the grey-clothed youth turn around and sent a weird look at Lin Yun. He asked, “You farted?”

Right then, a fragrance began to spread, containing a high density spiritual energy. The grey-clothed youth took a deep breath before closing his eyes in satisfaction. When he opened his eyes, he couldn’t help praising, “What a nice smell!”

But the moment he said that, the grey-clothed youth and Lin Yun’s gazes became weird as they looked at each other in awkward silence. They both felt awkward, including Lin Yun. But Lin Yun could do nothing about it because he couldn’t hold it in.

In the end, Lin Yun broke the silence with another fart. Shortly after, Lin Yun’s aura began to rise. He then quickly made a breakthrough in front of the grey-clothed youth, reaching the fourth channel of the Profound Death Stage.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This placed Lin Yun in an even more awkward position, and he wanted to leave. But just when he was about to move, he could sense a powerful murderous intent locking onto him. It came from the grey-clothed youth, who was hesitating if he should silence Lin Yun.

This made Lin Yun look awkward, and he could only stand there. Lin Yun and the grey-clothed youth held their breaths and looked at each other, not daring to speak. But when Lin Yun let out a few more farts, his cultivation reached the pinnacle fourth channel of the Profound Death Stage.

This bulged the grey-clothed youth’s pupils, and he wondered what cultivation technique Lin Yun practiced. He had just witnessed Lin Yun farting, and his cultivation began to rise. This was simply unheard of, and this piqued his curiosity even more. But he didn’t want to lower himself to ask that, so he could only suck it up.

In the end, Lin Yun couldn’t stand the silence anymore and awkwardly smiled, “Yeah, it smells pretty nice.”

Lin Yun was pretty blatant with his intention, asking if he could leave now.

Hearing that, the grey-clothed youth recalled his murderous intent before taking a deep breath. But just when he took a deep breath, Lin Yun farted again, making the surrounding atmosphere even more awkward. The grey-clothed youth’s face turned green as he stared at Lin Yun.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched because he didn’t do it on purpose. So he immediately turned around and wanted to leave, not wanting to waste time here.
