Chapter 1155 - Blood Hadn't Dried Up!

Lin Yun landed next to Ye Ziling emitting a terrifying chill. He could sense that Ye Ziling’s vitality was withering. Instead of leaving, Ye Ziling decided to hold the demonic cultivators back.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun took out a Nirvana Pellet and placed it into Ye Ziling’s mouth, instantly causing Ye Ziling’s face to become rosy. It was the pellet that could bring anyone back to life as long as they had a breath left. However, it only stopped Ye Ziling’s injuries from worsening.

Her eyes were closed and she showed no signs of waking up. From this alone, Lin Yun could imagine how injured she was.

“Boss, he’s Flower Burial! He’s the one who killed Thunderclap Sword Demon back in the Heavenly Astral Pavilion!” Xiao Kun instantly recognized Lin Yun as fear flashed through his pupils. The other demonic cultivators also had fear on their faces as they quickly backed off. After all, Flower Burial was extremely famous for killing demonic cultivators.

Hovering in the air, Lei Ying’s eyes were dark as he looked at Lin Yun. He then put on a sinister expression without bothering to conceal the killing intent in his eyes, “Looks like the rumors are true. You’re a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect!”

“It has nothing to do with you. Now, are you prepared to pay the price?” Lin Yun turned to look at Lei Ying coldly.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. Don’t bother acting before me. You’re still insufficient to save her in front of me. Others might fear you, but I’ve never placed you in my eyes!” Lei Ying said with a mocking expression. In his view, Lin Yun only had some attainments in the music dao.

When Lei Yiing was done talking, he merged with the black demonic flames. Then, lightning manifested into eagles on his left and flames manifested into birds on his right.

As the flaming birds and lightning eagles charged forward, the entire sky changed. It was an attack that could easily injure an Astral Stage expert.

Under Lin Yun’s mask, the sword cocoon hidden in the center of his brow began to buzz, causing the Silver Moon Mask to shine brightly. The entire mask was like a moon reflected on the lake, and this was the first time the sword cocoon ever stirred.

When a powerful sword intent began to rise around him, Lin Yun muttered, “There’s always a sky beyond!”

His words weren’t loud, but paths began to split in the sky enveloped in lightning and flames. As light shined down on Lin Yun, he revealed his glory as a swordsman.

Lei Ying was caught by surprise, taking three steps back to face Lin Yun’s sword intent. Lin Yun could feel his blood boiling at this moment as all the Demonic Astral Flowers began to blaze in his aura oceans. “Divine firmament manifest into my sword!”

With explosions sounding out in the sky, the flaming birds and lightning eagles were torn to bits by Lin Yun’s sword intent. Suddenly, the sky cleared up as silver light shined on Lin Yun, making him look like a deity.

When Lei Ying was sent flying, he threw up a mouthful of blood. However, he no longer had a face full of ridicule because he knew what the divine firmament sword intent meant. It was rare even for the Dragon Pulse Realm. “Divine firmament sword intent?!”

Lei Ying felt like something was off because he wasn’t in bad shape. At the very least, he should have been on the brink of death.

Although Lei Ying wasn’t in top form because he fought two Elysium Core Realm experts and Ye Ziling, he was still a quasi-Elysium Core Realm expert. He was the strongest demonic cultivator in the Profound Wither Sea who slapped Qin Feng to death.

When Lei Ying landed on the ground, he coughed violently as his face turned red. He then let out a burst of weird laughter before a terrifying aura swept out from his body, “Tsk, tsk. I’m being bullied now after all the battles I went through?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Emitting a violent aura, Lei Ying made Lin Yun feel suffocated. He knew that Lei Ying wasn’t an ordinary demonic cultivator but a genius who came from a demonic sect.

“What a pity. Even so, you’re still insignificant in my eyes. I don’t care what origin you have, but there’s only one outcome for you to face me and that’s death!” Lei Ying sneered before he drew his purple blade flickering with lightning.

“Hahaha!” Lei Ying began to laugh when he held onto the blade. When Xiao Kun looked at the blade, he squinted his eyes because he couldn’t remember the last time Lei Ying was forced to draw that blade.

A saint artifact? Lin Yun’s eyelid twitched as he placed the flute by his lips and started playing.

“Die!” Lei Ying held onto the saint artifact and charged toward Lin Yun, destroying all the phenomena created by the music. Then, he reached Lin Yun in the blink of an eye.

Where do the flowers bloom!

Lin Yun responded by changing the music, fully unleashing the power of the noble tune through his music. Facing Lei Ying’s blade, a wall of crimson roses appeared before him.

When the blade collided with the wall of crimson roses, sparks flew about. Although Lin Yun didn’t stop playing the flute, he was forced to take a few steps back. The wall of crimson roses only lasted for a brief moment before it was destroyed by Lei Ying.

Lei Ying continued his attack by crushing Lin Yun’s phenomenon with dazzling light. However, Lin Yun dodged every attack at the most critical moment.

After Lin Yun fully unleashed the phenomenon of the Dustlight Sword Art, his dragon soared into the sky with a growing destructive sword aura.

“Begone!” Lei Ying could feel his scalps tingling at this scene as he roared. The saint runes in his blade began to shine as he manifested a black lightning in the sky, instantly turning everything dark.

When the sky turned dark, a gigantic black palm descended from the sky. Lei Ying was unleashing the full power of the saint artifact with his quasi-Elysium Core Realm cultivation.

The palm instantly crushed the sea of flowers before landing on Lin Yun. The impact was so strong that the ground trembled and cracked. When Xiao Kun and the other demonic cultivators saw this scene, their faces became grave.

Suddenly, they felt a chill run down their spines as a figure struggled to stand in the cloud of dust. Lei Ying’s attack had practically destroyed the entire crimson stone forest, but the surroundings around Lin Yun were untouched.

Although no one could see Lin Yun’s appearance clearly, they could sense a pair of eyes piercing through the cloud of dust and staring at them.
