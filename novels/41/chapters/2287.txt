Chapter 2288 - Shocking The Eastern Desolation!

“Is that hand that hard to subdue?” Lin Yun muttered to himself. He was about to leave this place, but still worried about Su Ziyao. It looks like that hand was more powerful than the divine flame fragment. The divine flame was only a fragment, while the hand was complete and the hand of a God Lord. It possessed the power of a deity, so Lin Yun could only make a rough guess about it.

It didn’t take long for flute music to resound throughout the Fallen God Valley once more as a message, and his response was still the Sovereign Divine Runes. Seeing this, Lin Yun felt relieved and decided to leave.

Everyone who had gathered outside the God Burial Mountain Range was a Saint from the five holy lands, various sects, and the saint clans. All of the forces within the Eastern Desolation were here. But because of the restriction, they could only wait outside. The five holy lands had the biggest faction since they had many Saints with a Saint Sovereign leading them and a Great Saint in the dark.

Even holy lands didn’t have many Saint Sovereigns, not to mention Great Saints. This proved how serious they were with the divine flame fragment. The news was transmitted as more people began to leave the Heavenly Void.

The appearance of Flower Burial caused an uproar, and the fall of Flower Burial caused another uproar. The three holy lands nearly laughed when they heard that. After all, it was good news to them that Lin Yun died in the Heavenly Void.

Their interests were tied with Tian Xuanzi, and Lin Yun was the hope of the Radiant’s lineage. So, Lin Yun’s death would mean the Radiant’s lineage’s fall. But shortly after, another piece of news came: Flower Burial was alive and stronger than before. Even the geniuses from the three holy lands couldn’t do anything to him. This immediately left the three holy lands dumbfounded, before they got a bad feeling about it.

When the Saints Lin Yun saved came out, the battle in the Flame Dragon Valley also spread out. The news was more trustworthy since there were many witnesses.

“Suppressing thousands of demonic corpses by himself…”

“You guys didn’t see how shocking it was, and it couldn’t be described in words.”

"The three holy lands even brought out their Sovereign Saint Artifacts, but they couldn’t do anything to the enemies while Lin Yun resolved the trouble.”ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Are you serious about that? Isn’t he a Quasi-Saint?”

“So what if he’s only a Quasi-Saint? He’s the Heavenly Dragon Lord, first of the Empyrean, Divine Core, Dragon Pulse, and Samsara Edict Rankings, not to mention that he’s the strongest champion of the Heavenly Paths.”

“Holy shit… The three holy lands ran while Lin Yun saved you?”

“The three holy lands did that?”

“It’s true. Do you think that we’d lie?”

Everyone couldn’t maintain their composure when they heard about that, including those from the three holy lands. When they came to their senses, their faces were terrifyingly ugly.

“Get them to shut up! How can Flower Burial be so capable? Are they tired of living since they’re slandering the holy lands’ reputation?” The Ming Cult’s leader, the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign, gave an order.

“Roger that!” Several Saint Lords took his order and left. They were straightforward and injured several Saint Lords on the spot.

The Myriad Lightning Sect’s Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign then personally injured a Saint Lord who belonged to a saint clan while being a Saint Sovereign. Terrifying lightning descended, piercing through the chest of that Saint Lord and immobilizing him. This Saint Lord was the Roost End Saint Lord, who gave Lin Yun the Snowshadow Saint Lotus, a Clear Nether Sect saint elder.

They had already discussed breaking free from the three holy lands before coming out. After all, the three holy lands were too ruthless and didn’t treat them as allies. They helped out with killing the Blood Flame King and suffered huge casualties, but they weren’t allowed to have a share of the Blood Flame King’s treasures.

When they were in the Fallen God Valley, the three holy lands ran the moment there was trouble. Compared to them, Lin Yun was immortal since he suppressed all the demonic corpses and even brought them out with the Flame Dragon’s skeleton. When they talked to Lin Yun while on the Flame Dragon’s skeleton, they were won over by Lin Yun’s charisma.

They had already discussed that they would advertise for Lin Yun since they didn’t have the guts to face the three holy lands themselves. They had already expected that the three holy lands would be furious, but they didn’t panic.

“If you dare to run your mouth, I’ll cripple your cultivation!” The Myriad Lightning Sect’s Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign released a terrifying aura that made the sky tremble. Seeing this, they finally knew how terrifying an enraged Saint Sovereign was and everyone became quiet.

“It doesn’t change anything even if you kill me. Flower Burial saved us while the three holy lands ran with their Sovereign Saint Artifacts!” The Roost End Saint Lord said, gritting his teeth.

“You’re courting death!” The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign was furious. He had long received news that Lin Yun had killed the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord. So he lost it after hearing that these people were speaking out for Lin Yun.

“Calm down, calm down.” The Heavenly Flame Sect’s Flame Cry Saint Sovereign secretly said, “It’s not a good reputation to kill a Saint Lord in public. Once that happens, even the fake will become real.”

The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign’s face changed and held back. The Roost End Saint Lord was heavily injured and rolled on the ground as lightning flashed. But no one from the Clear Nether Sect dared to say anything and even thanked the Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign for showing mercy before they checked on the Roost End Saint Lord.

This instantly intimidated everyone since the three holy lands declared that those people had received benefits from Lin Yun and what they said were lies meant to slander them. The three holy lands were righteous sects and paid great attention to their reputation. So, if news of their men fleeing spreads, it would devastate their reputation.

Everyone also began to discuss amongst themselves and felt that the rumors were too exaggerated.

“According to them, Lin Yun is only a Quasi-Saint. But how did he defeat Huang Jingyu, Liu Yunlan, and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord?”

“Yeah, not to mention defeating a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit.”

“And that breathtaking sword to snatch the Divine Blood Fruit, suppressing thousands of demonic corpses by himself.”

“Even the Nine Emperors couldn't do anything better when they were at the Quasi-Saint Realm.”

“We’ll know if it’s true when Lin Yun comes out. Looking at the three holy lands, they won’t let this matter rest.” The three holy lands’ intimidation worked, and many people didn’t trust the rumors.

The three Saint Sovereigns of the three holy lands gathered together with ugly expressions.

“It’s probably true,” the Heavenly Flame Sect’s Flame Cry Saint Sovereign said with a grave expression. Not only did they fail to obtain the divine flame fragment, but they even had such a scandal in public.

“My sect’s Heavenly Kui Saint Lord is dead, so Lin Yun has to die for that,” the Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign said, gritting his teeth.

The Ming Cult’s Azure Glory Saint Sovereign said, “Calm down. We have to wait for them to come out.”

“Calm down?” The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign sneered, “Would you calm down if your young sect master died in the hands of Lin Yun?”

The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s eyelid jumped, before he coldly said, “Our young sect master won’t die so easily.”

Sensing the gunpowder in the atmosphere, the Flame Cry Saint Sovereign said, “Now isn’t the time to think about that. We should think of what to do.”

After a brief silence, the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign said, “The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s party hasn’t come out yet. When my young sect master comes out, we’ll decide again. But what the Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign said is right, Lin Yun has to die.”

“We have to make preparations early. As long as he’s dead, the rumors won’t matter,” the Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign said.

After this incident, the God Burial Mountain Range calmed down, but an undercurrent surged. Many forces gathered around the Clear Nether Sect to examine the heavily injured Roost End Saint Lord.

They asked what they wanted to know, and a person asked with a grave expression, “Are the rumors true?”

The Roost End Saint Lord sneered, “It’s true. If you guys had witnessed it, you’d know if I’m telling the truth. Even if the Radiant Sword Saint dies, the Radiant’s lineage will continue to exist. So I suggest you guys not to be in such a hurry to make a decision.”

Everyone was shocked when they heard that. They couldn’t believe that the rumors were all true.

The Roost End Saint Lord continued, “Just watch. We’ll all know when Flower Burial comes out.”

Everyone was shocked since their forces had tens of thousands of years of inheritance or at least a few thousand years. They naturally couldn’t be compared to holy lands, but they had the advantage of numbers if they joined forces. At the very least, they would have a higher number of Saints.

“Think carefully. If the Radiant’s lineage isn’t severed, there’s no need to go to the three holy lands.”

“Judging from what the Roost End Saint Lord said, Lin Yun has great fortune on him.”

“Isn’t he exaggerating this a little too much?” They began to discuss amongst themselves and even the most stubborn one wore a grave expression.

“Exaggerating?” The Roost End Saint Lord sneered, “Truthfully speaking, I have been holding back in my words because the reality is more unbelievable.”

Everyone was even more dumbfounded when they heard that.
