Chapter 1927 - Astral Sword Intent!

The Black Tortoise Chains returned to Lin Yun’s hand with nine seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits. This immediately brought joy to Lin Yun’s face because the seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits were much better than the six-colored ones.

Although his sword intent had reached the Astral Sword Intent, it was only at the initial stage and not even be at lesser mastery. Many saint fruits could strengthen cultivation, but saint fruits that could strengthen sword intent were rare. Even the most ordinary Heavenly Cloud Fruit was a rare treasure in the outside world and seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits were even rarer, and even the Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t have much of them.

“Ye Qingtian, since you’re so capable, then return the one I gave you earlier,” Crane Fairy said.

Lin Yun knew he couldn’t conceal it from Crane Fairy and wanted to hand her one of the seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits. But he couldn’t bear it and could only be shameless to reply, “It’s not easy to cultivate.”

“I wonder why my master takes a fancy to you. Behave yourself now, or I won’t be able to save you if you fall.” Crane Fairy gritted her teeth, looking at Lin Yun. But she didn’t pursue it and quickened her speed.

When they passed through two light gates, a sea of clouds appeared before Lin Yun, and there was a pavilion in the clouds. A simple courtyard was before the pavilion, and a white-clothed man was playing the zither in the courtyard.

The zither music was loud and filled with murderous intent. When submerged in it, he could see tens of thousands of swords flying out from the zither, and each sword could take a single life.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun and Crane Fairy to arrive before the courtyard, but they didn’t disrupt the white-clothed man playing the zither.

Lin Yun briefly listened to the zither and said, “That’s the Ancient Score—Heavenly War.”

He stayed in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion for some time and had seen some ancient scores. So he naturally knew about this music.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“How is it? My master’s attainment in music is way better than yours, right?” The Crane Fairy said with a prideful expression.

“Not too bad,” Lin Yun smiled. The white-clothed man’s attainment in music might be stronger than his, but it wasn’t much stronger. This person had a powerful mental energy, but his attainment in music was a little poor. So his attainment in music only reached the Great Saint Tone, which was far from the Imperial Tone.

This person had powerful mental energy and knew ancient scores, and this was why his performance was stronger than many people. At the very least, he wouldn’t lose to them in terms of aura. But their difference would become huge if he ran into someone like Mu Xueling.

“Watch what you’re saying.” The Crane Fairy looked at Lin Yun unhappily, thinking that Lin Yun was too disrespectful to her master.

“He’er, go prepare tea. He’s right, and my attainment in music is only ordinary.” The white-clothed man stopped and caressed the zither.

Although Crane Fairy was unhappy, she still obliged what the white-clothed man said and returned with tea.

“I’m grateful to Senior that I can grasp the Astral Sword Intent. How do I address Senior as?” Lin Yun asked sincerely. Without this person’s help, Lin Yun’s journey would have stopped at the seventh level. If he wanted to grasp the Astral Sword Intent, he might have to wait till his cultivation reached the Nirvana Stage.

“You have already grasped the Astral Sword Intent; your heart hasn’t reached that level. This ‘heart’ that I’m speaking of isn’t referring to the Sword Heart.”

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun asked.

“Heart is like this cup.” The white-clothed man raised the cup and toyed with it. As he spoke, he placed the cup on the desk and picked up the teapot. He said, “The water is the sword intent.”

The white-clothed man poured the tea out of the teapot, allowing the tea to overflow the cup, and explained, “Your heart can only contain this much, and any more will cause it to overflow.”

On the other hand, Lin Yun fell into deep thought, looking at the tea overflowing the cup.

“But you’ve grasped the Sword Heart. So the tea isn’t able to overflow and has been stored within.”

Like Lin Yun’s silver Sword Heart, silver runes appeared on the cup. When silver runes covered the cup, the water stopped overflowing. No matter how much tea poured out from the teapot, not a single droplet seeped out, as though the cup was a bottomless abyss.

This made Lin Yun inwardly alarmed, and he instantly figured everything out. His sword intent was stuck at the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, but his sword intent kept increasing and hadn’t stopped.

“Do you know what will happen if it continues?” The white-clothed man smiled, looking at Lin Yun.

But before Lin Yun could respond, cracks covered the teacup before it exploded.

This instantly made Lin Yun’s face change, with his heart throbbing violently. His face wouldn’t change if it was just the explosion of the teacup, but he took it for himself earlier. He instantly understood what the white-clothed man wanted to say.

He was special. Even if his sword intent was still at the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, his sword intent would continue accumulating due to his Sword Heart. If he couldn’t break the Astral Sword Intent, he would blow apart sooner or later like the teacup.

“Your sword intent has long reached a height comparable to the Astral Sword Intent. You’re just a little lacking to make a breakthrough, and you’re slowly making a breakthrough in your heart during the four trials on the seventh level…” The white-clothed man said, “This is why the later trials on the seventh level became easier for you, and you didn’t even need your sword for the last trial.”

“Why did you help me?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s because everyone else is mediocre in my eyes, while you stood out like a bright star,” the white-clothed man smiled. “You’re like a phoenix amongst a flock of birds.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned because that wasn’t a simple evaluation.

“Senior, may I ask who you are? Since you know I’m not Ye Qingtian, why did you still help me?” Lin Yun asked, baffled by this white-clothed man’s decision.

“You’re Dragon Origin Great Saint’s disciple, which means you’re my grand disciple. Furthermore, I was only looking at your sword and not you,” smiled the white-clothed man.

Lin Yun was alarmed after hearing what the white-clothed man said. The Dragon Origin Great Saint was already a Great Saint, so just how high was the status of this person? He instantly understood why the Dragon Origin Great Saint wanted him to visit the Celestial Purging Mountain. The Dragon Origin Great Saint probably wanted him to pass this person’s test.

“Senior, are you the third sword wielder?” Lin Yun asked.

“Don’t bother asking. You still have two more days in the Celestial Purging Mountain. If you can reach the end, I’ll tell you. Perhaps you might even be able to see the Emperor Sword,” the white-clothed man said. The Heavenly Dao Sect had three divine swords, the Heavenly Sword, Dao Sword, and Emperor Sword.

“But wasn't the Emperor Sword lost a long time ago? The Dragon Origin Great Saint personally told me about it…” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

“Since the sword chose to leave, it can also return by itself,” smiled the white-clothed man.

When Lin Yun returned to Indigo Thunder Peak, the sky became bright, and he returned to Ye Qingtian’s appearance. He activated the Three-Lives Fruit and entered the Three-Lives Realm once more. He still had two days in the outside world before the next round of the Ranking Battle started. So that was roughly two months in the Three-Lives Realm.

After entering the Three-Lives Realm, Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to refine the Heavenly Cloud Fruits and calmed himself down. He took a deep breath and planned to get used to the Astral Sword Intent first.

In his sword sea, a terrifying radiance shone from a small spark. But if he wanted to strengthen it, he would need to do what Jian Jingtian did, turn it into a sun. No matter how small it was, it was the Azure Sword Intent, and this speck could tear apart the thirty-six layers of heaven.

“I can focus on tempering the Sword Heart now that I’ve grasped the Astral Sword Intent…” Lin Yun muttered to himself.

Ye Guhan had already taught him how to temper his Sword Heart, but it was a secret technique he could only start using after grasping the Astral Sword Intent. He wanted to use this secret technique to fuse his Azure Dragon Intent and Sword Heart, forming the Azure Dragon Sword Heart.

When his sword intent makes another improvement, the Sword Heart would grow into the Azure Dragon Sword Domain, and the Azure Dragon Sword Heart was the rough outline of a sword domain.

He only spent seven days fusing the Azure Dragon Intent with the Sword Heart, and it was a smooth process. It was mainly because he possessed the Azure Dragon Saint Physique and had seen the Azure Dragon Constellation before. So it was easy for him to accomplish it.

The spark was his Astral Sword Intent, and the moment Lin Yun accomplished the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, his attainment in the sword reached a terrifying height.

Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Sword Heart with his pupils shining brightly like a pair of dragon pupils, and he could clearly see the minuscule dust.

“This way, I can find a breakthrough even if I’m facing a ghost spirit martial technique.” Lin Yun inwardly rejoiced because this strengthened his ability to find the flaw of his opponent’s attack.

Furthermore, when he circulated the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, a silver radiance shone, and a sword aura spread to a hundred feet away, which allowed Lin Yun to freely control wind and lightning within this distance. Faintly, a rough domain appeared, and Lin Yun was good in this domain.

“I might be fearless before a saint aura that’s within a hundred feet, and even a Quasi-Saint won’t be able to kill me in one move. If my opponent is careless, I might be able to injure him…” Lin Yun muttered to himself with joy on his face. But it was a pity that he didn’t have an opponent to give it a try.

Lin Yun planned to temper himself against demonic beasts after the Ranking Battle. As for the Ranking Battle, if he ran into Wang Yue again, he didn’t even have to use the Profound Thunder Sword Technique to win. Most importantly, he had just comprehended the Astral Sword Intent and had nine seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits left to refine. Thus, he had a huge room for improvement in his sword intent.

“But the likes of Wang Yue and Ye Feifan should have trump cards, so I can’t be careless.” Lin Yun’s trump cards were the Divine Firefly Sword and the Sword of the Beginning, without exposing his identity.

If he used two months to stabilize his Astral Sword Intent, it would become a powerful trump card, and he wouldn’t have to fear anyone!
