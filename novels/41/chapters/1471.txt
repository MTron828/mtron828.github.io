Chapter 1472 - Pinnacle of the Firmament Sword Intent

“Senior brothers, do you two still wish to continue?” Lin Yun sheathed his sword as he looked at Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan.

But Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan were in a daze, unable to come to their senses. They couldn’t believe that they were so easily defeated.

Even after some time had passed, neither of them came to their senses. They bitterly smiled when Lin Yun reached out and grabbed onto the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. They still had stronger means that they have yet to use, like the Skydome 9 Swords. It was a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique, and this sword technique had nine forms.

Unlike other ghost spirit martial techniques, the Skydome 9 Swords was extremely powerful and didn’t belong to any peaks. It could only be learned by paying a significant sum of contribution points to the Elders Hall.

But Lin Yun’s last two attacks were too bizarre and disappeared so suddenly. He looked immortal when he unleashed the first sword, bringing the Aquaheaven Sword Technique to the limit. But the last sword gave them an even greater sense of defeat because they couldn’t use their trump cards.

But it was inevitable that they would feel unconvinced about losing in this manner. But the bloodstains on their necks already told them that Lin Yun had shown them mercy.

“Senior Brothers, you two don’t seem to be convinced. Well, it doesn’t matter. Come and fight if you guys are unconvinced. Since I stood out today, I will naturally fight till you two are fully convinced.” Lin Yun raised his brow. “Because from today onwards, I don’t wish to hear about anyone on the Earth Ranking being unhappy about me being a heaven direct disciple. Otherwise, you guys will be disrespectful to my Divine Firmament Peak, my master, and the sect master. My sword won’t go easy on you guys at that time!”

The surroundings fell silent when everyone heard what Lin Yun said. It turned out that Lin Yun knew that many people were unhappy this whole time. This made everyone on the Earth Ranking look at Lin Yun with complicated gazes, especially Huangfu Yan, whose pupils were blazing with rage. But he didn’t have the guts to say a word because Lin Yun was simply insane. Lin Yun was trying to step on everyone on the Earth Ranking.

Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan’s faces changed with shock in their eyes. Although Lin Yun was polite by calling them “Senior Brothers”, his words were arrogant. Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan were the most unhappy about Lin Yun becoming a heaven direct disciple, and they were behind everything in suppressing Lin Yun.

They initially wanted to suppress him during this Five Peaks Competition before raising an objection to the sect master and either dismiss Lin Yun’s status as a heaven direct disciple or promote them to heaven direct disciples. But they never expected that they would mess it up.

On the sea of clouds where the five peak masters stood together, the faces of three of the peaks weren’t too great. Huangfu Jue turned to look at Mu Chuan, and said with a smile, “That junior brother of yours isn’t just arrogant. He seems to have forgotten that the sect master is the peak master of the Scarlet Firmament Peak!”

“Haha. When will Senior Brother Huangfu drink all the water in the Celestial Observing Lake? I’m waiting for it. If I’m seeing this correctly right now, the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower seems to be in the hands of my junior brother.” Mu Chuan smiled.

His words instantly made Huangfu Jue shut up, with his face becoming black. When Mu Chuan saw that Huangfu Jue no longer dared to say a word, he continued, “Actually, what he said isn’t wrong. Senior Brother is the sect master, and his decision isn’t something that even peak masters would dare to go against, not to mention a bunch of disciples. Lin Yun’s strength is enough to prove that Senior Brother has a keen eye for talent, which is probably why he’s the sect master, and we’re not!”

“Stop flattering me.” Mu Xuankong smiled as he looked at Mu Chuan.

“Haha, I’m being absolutely honest here.” Mu Chuan winked and inwardly breathed out a sigh of relief. He felt fortunate that the sect master didn’t mind what he said. Then again, it also made sense since Mu Xuankong even gave Lin Yun something as precious as the Divine Golden Crow Iron.

“But his words are a little too big. If he doesn’t have enough strength, he might be embarrassed by so many people. There might be unknown variables in this Five Peaks Competition. So Junior Brother Huangfu, you don’t have to rush to drink up the water in the Celestial Observing Lake.” Mu Xuankong smiled.

As soon as he said that, the faces of the other peak masters changed. Could it be that the sect master managed to see something?

Huangfu Jue’s eyes lit up when he heard that. If Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi could make a comeback, there was no doubt that he would be the happiest.

“Where does that guy get his confidence from?” Many Dragon Pulse Realm disciples on the Celestial Observing Lake were shocked when they heard what Lin Yun said. Not only did Lin Yun defeat Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan, but he even wanted them to be convinced. This was a little too much. After all, defeating someone and making someone feel convinced were two entirely different concepts.

Sure enough, rage appeared on Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan’s faces when they heard what Lin Yun said. As Jin Xuanyi’s eyes blazed with anger, he said, “Lin Yun, you’re going too far here! I admit that you won this battle, but there’s no way you can make me feel convinced! Since you can become a heaven direct disciple, why can’t I?!”

Ji Shuxuan was also unhappy because this was no longer about defeating them but completely disregarding them. Who did Lin Yun think they were? This was too outrageous, not to mention that Lin Yun didn’t have the strength to convince them. Also, it wouldn’t be long before they reached the Dragon Pulse Realm. At that time, Lin Yun wouldn’t be their opponent at all. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Junior Brother Lin, we’re indeed unconvinced. But I advise you to stop while you can. Since you’ve already won, there’s no need for you to keep pushing it. I’ll not beat around the bush; you still don’t have the strength to convince us!” Ji Shuxuan said.

“Not enough strength?” Lin Yun briefly pondered before suddenly saying, “Is this enough, then?”

When Lin Yun was done, a terrifying sword aura exploded with his sword intent manifesting into rolling lightning, causing the lake to tremble under his sword intent.

Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi were stunned when they sensed the sword intent that suddenly exploded from Lin Yun, but their expressions soon became mocking when they looked at him. Wasn’t it just firmament sword intent? If it was just the firmament sword intent, the gulf in their realms alone wouldn’t be something that Lin Yun could overcome.

To put it bluntly, the firmament sword intent still wasn’t enough to convince them. But suddenly, Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan’s expressions changed as cracks appeared on the Celestial Observing Lake. When they raised their heads again, their jaws nearly dropped because they saw that the sky was moving and the vast ocean of clouds was swiftly descended in just a short period of time. It was now only a few hundred meters above them.

Everyone on the Celestial Observing Lake was under immense pressure before they fell onto one knee, and their faces were distorted with pain. As Lin Yun hovered in the air, he raised his hand, showing that the sky was just within his reach.

“This…” Everyone was left dumbfounded because that was the pinnacle of the firmament sword intent. If Lin Yun took another step, he would reach the fifth-grade sword intent while he was still at the Elysium Core Realm.

“I knew it!” Mu Xueqin finally confirmed her speculation. She wasn’t wrong about Lin Yun grasping the pinnacle of the firmament sword intent while being at the Elysium Core Realm. But she couldn’t figure out how he managed to do it.

It was hard for others to grasp the firmament sword intent, and Mu Xueqin knew how tough it was since she was ranked third on the Heaven Ranking.

“Big Sister, was this your speculation?” Mu Qingqing had shock and surprise on her face.

“Yeah.” Mu Xueqin replied, but her expression was complicated as she looked at the azure-clothed swordsman with her eyes shining brightly.
