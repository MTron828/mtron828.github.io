Chapter 1593 - Great Boost In Strength!

The tribulation of the Dragon Pulse Realm finally arrived, but the first tribulation didn’t fall from the sky. The massive dragon that was hidden in the clouds released several roars before igniting the dragon's origin within Lin Yun’s body, turning it into flames that raged within. The effects of the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood that he had just refined were soon put to action.

Black Tortoise’s saint runes began to appear within his meridians, bones, and internal organs. The saint runes were larger than the Heavenly Profound Tortoise’s tortoise shell that resisted the raging dragon flames.

Simultaneously, the golden human within his sword ocean slowly opened his eyes. When sword rays radiated from the golden human’s pupils, a powerful sword aura swept out. When the golden human formed a seal with both hands, a golden Azure Dragon flew out from the sword ocean and coursed through his body, clashing with the raging dragon flames.

With every impact, the dragon flames weakened, soon calming down. Blazed by the dragon flames, the golden Azure Dragon became even more refined, and Lin Yun intended to temper his sword soul with dragon flames, laying down the foundation to make a breakthrough in his sword intent.

He already planned to use this opportunity to reach the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. If he missed this opportunity, he wouldn’t know how long he would have to wait for the next one because the breakthrough of the fifth-grade sword intent was too tough.

The dragon origin within Lin Yun’s body was massive. So when the old dragon flames died, new dragon flames appeared. When the dragon flames ultimately died down, the second wave of the tribulation arrived.

This time, Lin Yun would have to face lightning tribulation. Raising his head, the first thing that entered his scope was the boundless thunderclouds, where a massive dragon was hiding within, reaching a thousand feet long and letting out a draconic roar.

Even if Lin Yun was prepared, he couldn’t help furrowing his brows when he saw the scale of his tribulation. Logically speaking, the first and second tribulations shouldn’t be so tough, and the third should be terrifying. But for Lin Yun, his first tribulation was already so dreadful. Was this because he had reached the tenth-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm?

This was just as he had intended. Since heaven wanted to destroy him, he would fight heaven. Before the tribulation descended, the golden human within Lin Yun’s sword ocean flew out and charged into the lightning vortex along with Lin Yun’s sword aura.

As a golden light shone brightly, the thunderclouds were pierced by multiple golden pillars of light that contained boundless sword intent. At the center of the golden pillars, the golden human released a dazzling golden light that attracted all the lightning over. This was a majestic scene.

After making it through the tribulation, Lil’ Red reached the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, turned into a streak of light, and landed beside Lil’ Purple.

“Big Brother will be fine, right?” Lil’ Red asked.

“I’m not sure. That scumbag really did it…” Lil’ Purple replied.

Lin Yun knew that his tribulation would be terrifying, but he still wanted to use this opportunity to grasp the fifth-grade sword intent. This meant that he would be in a dangerous situation, even with the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood. If Lin Yun or his sword soul were injured, he would lose his life in this tribulation.

“This is a headache.” Lil’ Purple rubbed her head. This was only the first tribulation, but Lin Yun made it troublesome. When Lil’ Purple opened her eyes again, the lightning finally descended from the sky.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

A lightning bolt pierced through the third layer of heaven, passing through the golden human, before landing on Lin Yun. As the tribulation’s power spread through the ground, purple lightning flames blazed within a hundred-mile radius.

Since Lin Yun was in the flames, lightning coursed throughout his body, and his facial expression became sinister while he let out a painful howl. At this moment, he suffered a heavy blow to his sword soul and physique.

His internal organs, meridians, bones, and flesh had to bear the tempering of dragon flames. Even fine cracks had appeared on the Black Tortoise’s saint runes within his body. When Lin Yun threw out a mouthful of blood, the golden human in the sky also did the same.

When the golden human threw out a mouthful of golden blood, it turned into a terrifying storm of sword intent that was raging across the horizon. With his soul suffering a heavy blow, blood dripped from Lin Yun’s forehead, looking like a blooming rose on his face.

When the dragon in the sky let out a ferocious roar, immense pressure descended. Under the dragon's roar, the lightning flames came to life and manifested into various demonic beasts that charged at Lin Yun.

“Illusory Beast Tribulation?” Lil’ Purple was shocked upon seeing this. It was rare for people to have the lightning flames manifest into various demonic beasts in their first tribulation, which meant that Lin Yun was in greater danger. Lin Yun’s sword soul was facing the lightning tribulation in the sky, and his flesh had to face the flames and lightning in addition to the thousands of demonic beasts. So there was no doubt that Lin Yun was in a dangerous position.

Lil’ Purple widened her mouth, but she had no idea how Lin Yun would make it out of this ordeal. Clenching her fists, Lil’ Purple was even more nervous than during her own tribulation, “You have to hold on!”

Right then, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes with flames and fighting spirits burning in his pupils. As he inwardly let out a roar, he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon to lift the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron from his dragon origin ocean.

In the past, he used the Netherflower to control the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron. But the Netherflower was resisting the tribulation now, which meant he could only rely on himself. When the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron broke free from the dragon origin ocean, Lin Yun clasped his hands together and dragon flames burst from his pores. The lightning on the surface of his body was being torn apart by this power.

As the thousands of demonic beasts roared, Lin Yun soared to the sky and pushed out four palms, unleashing boundless sword aura.

“Wind! Fire! Lightning! Ice!” As his sword aura formed into the four ancient words, the surrounding demonic beasts were destroyed before they could even get close. When Lin Yun sat back down on the ground, all the demonic beasts were like fireworks as they blew apart. Letting out a snort, Lin Yun raised his head to the sky, “Come back!”

When the golden human descended from the sky and returned to his sword ocean, a powerful energy fluctuation swept out from Lin Yun. When the two sword souls merged, they were like a cocoon sinking into the sword ocean.

Before Lin Yun could comprehend his sword souls, lightning bolts descended from the sky. But when facing this terrifying lightning, Lin Yun blocked it by using his dragon runes and bore the rest with his physique. Lin Yun's wounds swiftly healed as countless dragon runes were produced from the Blue Dragon Bone.

“He made it through!” Lil’ Purple leaped into the air in excitement, but she knew the tribulation hadn’t ended yet. She still couldn’t relax because Lin Yun’s tribulation couldn’t be considered normal.

The thousand-foot long dragon could be faintly seen within the thunderclouds, coiling above Lin Yun. In the next second, a flash of terrifying lightning began to accumulate. Not even geniuses at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm could withstand it, judging from the power of this accumulated energy.

“Retreat!” Lil’ Purple’s face changed as she retreated with Lil’ Red without hesitation. Soon after, black lightning that was a hundred meters wide descended from the sky and landed on Lin Yun.

“No…!” Lil’ Purple yelled. In the crucial moment, the Black Tortoise’s saint runes flew out of Lin Yun’s body and formed a massive tortoise shell that enveloped him.

The tortoise shell lasted only a few breaths before fine cracks appeared, and the tortoise shell started crumbling. Simultaneously, a boundless sword aura exploded from Lin Yun and his dragon origin ocean grew from fifty thousand feet to a hundred thousand feet, increasing by a fold. When the second dragon pulse had successfully formed within Lin Yun’s body, both the aura of his cultivation and Heavenly Dome Sword Intent appeared from him.

“Die!” Sensing the massive energy within his body, a terrifying sword intent began to surge within his brows. At this moment, his sword was heaven, and he was one with his sword.

Letting out a roar, Lin Yun raised his head to shatter the remaining black lightning before executing the Azure Dragon Grasp. A massive dragon claw appeared that ripped the thousand-foot long dragon down from the sky.

The azure dragon claw grasped the dragon by its neck and a cold light was flashing within Lin Yun’s pupils. At this moment, he was giving off the aura of an overlord while executing the Divine Azure Annihilation.

His Azure Dragon Sword Soul manifested into a golden ray of nearly a thousand feet, destroying the dragon Lin Yun was holding onto. When the dragon’s head was destroyed, the thunderclouds began to dissipate.

He had reached the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm and grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. Lin Yun’s strength underwent an explosive boost after using this tribulation, reaching an unimaginable height.

“That works?” Lil’ Purple was surprised, looking at Lin Yun.
