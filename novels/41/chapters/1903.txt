Chapter 1904 - Fishing Expert

When Lin Yun came to the summit of the mountain, he discovered that many people were standing here, and they didn’t choose to go into secluded cultivation. They sat down and closed their eyes to meditate. Not only were there inner disciples, but some saint disciples were also here.

Noticing the doubt within Lin Yun’s pupils, Chen Feng smiled, “The Celestial Purging Mountain is open once a year, and most of these people came here last month, so they naturally can’t attempt the trial again. They will observe from here and try to comprehend. Meanwhile, some are purely curious about how far the competitors can reach.”

This was similar to the Fleeting Cloud Thirteen Trials. A moment later, Lin Yun asked, “How far have you reached?”

“Well… I can’t even make it through the first trial,” Chen Feng awkwardly smiled. “It’s practically impossible for those beneath the Nirvana Stage to make it through the first trial, but you’ll receive many benefits. Not only does it test your martial intent, it also tests your aptitude, comprehension, and wisdom.”

Lin Yun looked at the sea of clouds and saw ten-odd people soaring to the sky. They landed on the sea of clouds and pressed on, and there seemed to be some energy that soon pulled everyone away. The one leading was someone enveloped in lightning, and he was far ahead of everyone.

“Ouyang He!” Lin Yun recognized that person. He was Ouyang He, who caused a commotion earlier, and his cultivation was at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

“It has been a few years, and Senior Brother Ouyang has a significant strength boost. He might be able to make it through the third trial this time,” someone spoke out.

Lin Yun took a glance and noticed that there was a massive platform at the summit of the mountain, and there was a monument by the cliffside. The monument was divided into several sections, each with different names written on it. With a few glances, Lin Yun instantly figured out that those who made it through the trial would have their names on the monument.

After briefly observing it, Lin Yun decided to try it and soared into the sea of clouds. Very quickly, he entered the depths of the sea of clouds and gradually disappeared.

Lin Yun resisted the strong pressure while traveling through the sea of clouds and pressed on. He didn’t know where the pressure came from, but it was ancient and consistent. Along the way, he ran into many people. Although they wouldn’t die if they fell, it wouldn’t be easy on them, and they might be injured.

Lin Yun relied on his sword intent to resist that aura. But a palace appeared before him after he diminished 20% of his sword intent. He didn’t hesitate to fly over, passing through multiple stone pillars. The palace looked mysterious, and everyone sat down to meditate when they descended. They weren’t in a hurry to continue forth.

Half an incense time later, multiple paintings appeared before Lin Yun. Each painting gave off a powerful saint aura, and the pressure he felt along the way came from these paintings. Before he could look at the paintings, a painting opened up and sucked him into it.

When his vision recovered, a white-clothed swordsman appeared before him.

“The gatekeeper?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right. Defeat me to make it through the first trial or resist for a hundred moves without falling,” the white-clothed swordsman said.

“Doesn’t seem that difficult after all,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Come and give it a try, then. I remember you, and I have a deep impression of your face. You couldn’t even take a single move from me in the past.” The white-clothed swordsman’s pupils flashed with disdain. Ye Qingtian couldn’t last a move in the past.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“It’s different now, so you can try it again.” Lin Yun calmly looked at the white-clothed swordsman.

“Haha!” The white-clothed swordsman waved his hand, and a sword flew out from the clouds. When he grabbed onto the sword, he thrust his sword as fast as a bolt of lightning. In the blink of an eye, he unleashed eighteen swords, each containing a powerful lethality.

Firefly Radiance? Lin Yun instantly recognized that it was the first sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword. It was just that the white-clothed swordsman had disassembled it into eighteen swords. This was simple, and Lin Yun easily dodged the incoming attacks by strolling.

“How is this possible?!” The white-clothed swordsman was shocked. He remembered that Ye Qingtian used to be a piece of garbage in the past and easily lost with just one move. He even went as far as going down on his knees to beg for mercy before launching a sneak attack. This was why the white-clothed swordsman had a deep impression of Ye Qingtian. But it had just been a year, and Ye Qingtian was like a new person.

When Lin Yun drew his sword, he simply used one sword to easily resolve the white-clothed swordsman’s attack with his sword thrust into the latter’s chest.

“The Firefly Radiance! You also know the Divine Firefly Sword!” The white-clothed swordsman was shocked. “How can a piece of trash like you possibly learn the Divine Firefly Sword?”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched. How terrible was Ye Qingtian in the past that even the artifact spirit looked down on him?

“Three days is enough to look at a person in a new light, and three months are enough for someone to change. Not to mention that it has been a year.” Lin Yun smiled profoundly, and his sword pierced through the white-clothed swordsman.

“I have made it through the trial?” Lin Yun felt as though he passed through an invisible wall. When he raised his head, he could see multiple paintings unfolding and numerous disciples fighting that white-clothed swordsman. They weren’t sucked into the painting, but merely stood on the painting to fight the white-clothed swordsman. Thus, everyone else could watch the entire process.

Most people failed, and the paintings would fold up when they failed. When Lin Yun looked around, only roughly seven to eight people made it through the first trial. Then again, he didn’t count those who had already left.

Lin Yun briefly looked around before he continued forth. The steps on the stage were high, linking to an unknown region. Until now, Lin Yun hadn’t noticed anything unusual about it, aside from his sword intent being tempered a little, and the benefits were close to none.

But the moment he moved, a woman opened her eyes and quickly caught up to him. This woman wasn’t beautiful, but she was clean and looked ordinary. Thus, she was insignificant, standing amongst the crowd. The only thing that stood out was her voluptuous figure that her sackcloth clothes couldn’t conceal.

She swiftly caught up to Lin Yun and said, “It has been a year since we last met, and I didn’t expect you to make it through the first trial with one sword.”

Lin Yun had long noticed this person, but he didn’t treat her seriously because he felt that this person might be Ye Qingtian’s lover. This really made him doubt Ye Qingtian’s taste.

With no change on his face, he casually replied to her, “It’s still alright. It’s just the first trial, and this is nothing.”

This woman had an ordinary appearance but a pair of beautiful eyes. She smiled, “To make it through the first trial without reaching the Nirvana Stage, I bet many people on the Celestial Purging Mountain are shocked.”

“What has it got to do with me?” Lin Yun replied indifferently. He continued, increasing his pace, wanting to shake the woman off.

But she quickly caught up with Lin Yun and smiled, “Ye Qingtian, you’ve forgotten me now that you’ve become a saint disciple and the disciple of the Dragon Origin Great Saint?”

“No. I’m not worthy of you, and you deserve someone better,” Lin Yun smiled.

“What are you talking about? That’s not what you said in the past.” The woman wore a gentle smile.

“How was I in the past, then?” Lin Yun asked.

“You only have me in your heart, and you’ll find ways to get the saint spring from the Dao Yang Palace for me whenever I’m thirsty. When I’m craving, you’ll find ways to get various snacks for me. When I’m bored, you'll find ways to make me happy,” the woman said. She continued, “If I want the stars in the sky, you’ll even find ways to get them for me.”

Lin Yun was speechless when he heard that. He replied, “Don’t mention the past anymore. We won’t be able to go back to how we were.”

“You’ve changed. That’s not how you were in the past,” the woman said in a heartbroken tone.

“Then where were you when I was bullied?” Lin Yun snickered. Since this woman made it through the first trial, she must be stronger than Ye Qingtian a year ago. If she had been willing to help, Ye Qingtian wouldn’t have suffered so much.

“They’re all my friends… So how do you want me to help? But I dote on you the most in my heart, and you know that,” the woman sighed.

Lin Yun scoffed upon hearing that. It turns out that this woman was a fishing expert, letting the fish fight in the pond while she watched. She probably came after seeing that Lin Yun didn’t go and look for her after becoming a direct disciple of a Great Saint.

He swiftly figured out the entire story and carried on forth, ignoring the woman. The Heavenly Dao Sect had a lot of women, and this woman’s appearance was ordinary. When Lin Yun came to the end of the steps, the woman quietly followed behind him.

The far end was a platform, and the edge of the platform was a cliff. When he looked down, he could see countless people below, and they were those gathered on the Celestial Purging Mountain.

The border of the platform was linked with chains, and the far end of each chain was a palace. Roughly looking at it, there were ten-odd floating palaces. Whenever a breeze blew past, the chains would shake around.

This made Lin Yun wonder if he would die if he fell down. But did this mean everyone had to walk on the chains and couldn’t fly over? He noticed people were walking on the chains, and they were careful with their footsteps. No one dared to fly over even if their faces had become pale with fright and obediently walked on the chains.

“We must walk on the chains on this trial, and any other means will fail. Not to mention that no one can fly over.” The woman pointed at a palace ahead and continued, “See those crows? They’re the Blood Crows kept by the sect, and they’ll peck the eyes of anyone who dares to fly around them.”

“That terrifying?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

“Yeah,” the woman replied. “Even a Quasi-Saint can’t do a thing to these Blood Crows. So no one dares to give it a try.”

“What if we fall?” Lin Yun asked.

“Half-dead. There’s an invisible sword intent vortex below, and no one can stabilize their dragon origin if they fall,” the woman explained.

“What if I want to return?” Lin Yun continued to ask.

“It looks like you have forgotten many things. If you want to go back, you have to call upon the Celestial Crane with the medal on your waist, and they’ll bring you back,” the woman smiled. She looked ordinary, but her smile was enchanting.

This surprised Lin Yun, but he wasn’t too bothered by it. He soon picked a chain and walked on it. When he took a few steps out, he discovered that the chains were shaking violently. It was the woman who followed behind him, and this alarmed him.

The Blood Crows on the palace up ahead looked at him, and the woman was behind him. When he came to a stop, the chains shook even more violently, and he was shocked to discover that the chains caused the dragon origin within his body to rumble as they shook.

The dragon origin within his body spiraled out of control, and he couldn’t calm it down even with his sword intent. Right then, a scream came from another chain. This was because someone had fallen. The cry made his face even paler than before.

He could hear a scuffle as the woman swiftly approached him. He could even smell the fragrance on her, instantly making him even more nervous.
