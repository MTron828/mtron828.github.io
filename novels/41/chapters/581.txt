Chapter 582 - A Whole New Understanding

Lin Yun let out a long breath as he looked around with his pupils narrowed. The terrifying power of this attack had also startled him. He didn’t expect this attack to be so powerful when he had only practiced it for three days.

It felt strange to him. He had clearly practiced it for three days, but the essence of this sword technique felt as if they were imprinted in his mind. It felt as if the azure-clothed man’s memory had become his, so he could easily use the sword technique as he wished. It felt as though he had been practicing this sword technique for more than three years…

He had to practice the Overlord Sword for a long time, but the Dustlight Sword Art was completely different. In fact, it felt completely different from all the martial techniques that he practiced.

Composing his thoughts, Lin Yun looked at the Flower Burial Sword before him and drew it out from the ground. As the sword buzzed, Lin Yun muttered, “This sword technique is really powerful. Even my sword intent seems to have improved.”

Where do the flowers bloom? Where do I come from?

He didn’t know the answers to those questions in the past, but he knew them now. The flower was his heart. It had to be prideful like the flower and it wouldn’t tolerate even a speck of dust.

Where do the flowers bloom? This was the same as asking why practice the sword. Where do I come from? This referred to the direction of his sword. So, why practice the sword? It was so that he could disperse the dust and let his heart become pure again. As for the direction of his sword, it signified the ability to press on without the fear of death.

Lin Yun didn’t know the azure-clothed man’s answers, but these were his conclusions. As he practiced the sword technique, he could look into his heart more clearly. This meant that he could temper his sword intent. If a woman were to practice this sword instead, her focus might be different. For instance, she might focus on ‘No one possesses everything in this world, and I shall give the lord a white lily!’

There was a flower in this world called the calla lily, which represented innocent love. For the woman in the painting, the lily represented her love for the azure-clothed man.

Seven days had passed in the blink of an eye and Lin Yun was seated on top of a hill slowly opening his eyes. His black pupils shined like black gems as they reflected the clouds in the sky.

But the reflection of the clouds weren’t actually the clouds in the sky. These clouds were part of Lin Yun’s boundless sword intent. Lin Yun stood up as he recalled all his sword intent into his body, “My xiantian sword intent actually reached complete mastery in just seven days.”

He had spent the past seven days practicing the Dustlight Sword Art. Aside from getting more familiar with it, the power of this sword technique didn’t increase. But that didn’t mean he didn’t have a harvest because his heart became clearer. And today, his pinnacle xiantian sword intent had reached complete mastery.

Sword intent was classified into nine grades with the xiantian sword intent being the first step. Above the xiantian sword intent was the spiritual sword intent. But there weren’t many in the Ancient Southern Domain with a spiritual sword intent. Lin Yun also wasn’t in a hurry to get there as he preferred to let things proceed smoothly.

“The Dustlight Sword Art is really profound. But it’s time for me to return now.” Lin Yun turned around as he headed back to the Spiritwood Peak. When he turned around, the clouds that had been split into two slowly joined together. The splitting of the clouds had been caused by a glance from Lin Yun. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If it was someone else, they would have rejoiced that their xiantian sword intent reached lesser mastery. But Lin Yun was calm despite his xiantian sword intent reaching complete mastery. This was because his scope had been widened after seeing the azure-clothed man.

The change in Lin Yun’s mentality might seem insignificant, but it made a great difference for his future. When he came out of the mountain range, two people jumped down from the trees. Lin Yun had already sensed them and knew that they were from the academy.

“You have my admiration. None of us dared to step into the forbidden zone, but you can come and go as you wish,” said the two disciples in a respectful tone. After the Five Academies Competition, Lin Yun had become a legend in the academy. All the disciples were filled with admiration for him.

“You guys seem to have been waiting for me. Does someone want to see me?” asked Lin Yun.

The two disciples exchanged a glance before they smiled, “We’re under Senior Sister Mo’s orders to wait for you. We would’ve gone after you if the forbidden zone wasn't so dangerous.”

“Senior Sister Mo wants you to pay her a visit when you’re done.”

So it turns out that Mo Ling was looking for him. Lin Yun said goodbye to the two disciples and left. It didn’t take long for him to return to the academy since the path along the way was empty. It seems that something has happened in the academy that attracted everyone over.

Although it was weird, Lin Yun didn’t think too much about it. After all, he would be leaving the academy soon and this had nothing to do with him.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to arrive at Mo Ling’s residence. Mo Ling was dressed in a purple dress as she spoke unhappily, “You really can’t stay at one place, can you? You just came out from the Qianyang Cave and you headed straight to the Spiritwood Peak. It took me a great deal of effort to look for you.”

The two were well-acquainted, so Lin Yun smiled awkwardly, “You’re looking for me?”

“When do you intend to leave and where are you going?” asked Mo Ling.

Her question stunned Lin Yun because he never expected that she would ask him about this. Farewells were always filled with sorrow, but nothing was eternal in the world. He had completed everything he needed at the academy, so it was time for him to leave.

Lin Yun pondered briefly before he replied, “Seven days at most. I’m still not sure where I’ll be going. I plan to travel around the Ancient Southern Domain as much as possible before the Draconic Banquet. Perhaps I’ll pay a visit to the Sword Sect’s ruins.”

The Sword Sect was once a super overlord force that once ruled the Ancient Southern Domain. His Overlord Sword came from the Sword Sect, so it would be great if he could find the missing techniques in the ruins. Then again, he didn’t hold much hope for that. God knows how long the Sword Sect had been destroyed.

“Seven days? That’s really quick,” sighed Mo Ling. She looked at Lin Yun and asked, “But what will happen to Yunyan if you leave like that?”

“Hmmm?” Lin Yun was shocked by those words. He had no idea why Liu Yunyan was related to this matter. But Lin Yun soon understood what she meant after Mo Ling explained it to him. So it turns out that Mo Ling had misunderstood that he had feelings for Liu Yunyan based on his conversation with Liu Yunyan back at the Library Hall.

Lin Yun spent a great deal of effort before he managed to convince Mo Ling that he wasn’t interested in Liu Yunan. But Mo Ling chuckled as she looked at Lin Yun, “Our Yunyan is so beautiful. What don’t you like about her?”

Lin Yun smiled bitterly. Mo Ling no longer looked like the cold person she once was in the past.

“Quick or I won’t let you leave,” said Mo Ling.

“I already have someone I like,” said Lin Yun.

“Really?” she asked.

“Ye...ah,” confirmed Lin Yun.

Mo Ling was curious, “Is she beautiful?”

“...More beautiful than Yunyan.” Lin Yun nodded his head in response.

“What about me then?” Mo Ling smiled, which gave Lin Yun a whole new impression of her.

Lin Yun really couldn’t tell who was better between Su Ziyao and Mo Ling. The two ladies had different temperaments. But there was no doubt that Mo Ling was a great beauty in the Nether Prefectural City, not to mention that she was also a monstrous genius on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

But when Lin Yun recalled Su Ziyao back in the Great Qin Palace, he smiled as he nodded his head, “She should be more beautiful than you.”

Mo Ling’s smile disappeared and she replied, “No wonder you would fall for her. But I’m really curious about how she looks now.”

“Let’s put a pause on this topic for now. Why are you looking for me?” Lin Yun quickly closed the topic before it got out of hand.

“I’ll let you off for now then. But if I find out that she isn’t as pretty as me, then I won’t let you off easily.” Mo Ling glared at Lin Yun before she revealed a smile. She continued, “Something big happened in the Nether Prefectural City, but I’m not sure if you’re interested in it since you’re intending on leaving so soon.”

“What is it?” Lin Yun asked anyway. He couldn’t help connecting it to the empty academy he noticed along the way.
