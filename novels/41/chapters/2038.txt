Chapter 2039 - Get Lost! (1)

Lin Yun had no change on his face, but he couldn’t conceal the shock in his heart when he heard the bearded youth was the Dao Yang Holy Son. It was hard for him to imagine that this person, who looked like a beggar, was the Dao Yang Holy Son.

There were legends that this person was powerful, and he was known as one of the Twin Stars of Eastern Desolation along with the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s little princess. He had heard of the Dao Yang Holy Son’s name when he arrived at the Heavenly Dao Sect, but looking at the Dao Yang Holy Son shattered all of his anticipations.

“I pay my respect to Senior Brother,” Lin Yun greeted politely despite his shock.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re not bad,” Li Daoyang smiled. The reason why he came here was to meet Ye Qingtian. He was satisfied with Ye Qingtian’s performance, but the only problem might be Ye Qingtian’s identity.

“Do you want to go to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda?” Li Daoyang asked. “Not the lowest level that other saint disciples could enter, but the core secret realm of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.”

“I naturally do. But I plan to enter after reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm,” Lin Yun said. The opportunity to enter the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was rare, and he didn’t want to waste his opportunity. So he planned to go in after reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm. The higher his cultivation, the greater the benefits he would receive once he entered.

“Smart. You can focus on your breakthrough, then.” Li Daoyang gave Ye Qingtian a deep gaze before preparing to leave.

“Li Daoyang, you’ve been away for a long time. Did you bring me any presents?” The Crane Fairy planted her arms at her waist.

Li Daoyang smiled, “Of course, I brought one. Stretch your hand out.”

“Hehe,” the Crane Fairy chuckled, her pupils filled with anticipation. But when Li Daoyang slapped her palm, the pain made the Crane Fairy furious as she roared, “What are you doing?!”

“I have given you all my love,” Li Daoyang smiled before leaving.

“You stinky fellow! I’ll curse you for not showering for the rest of your life!” The Crane Fairy furiously said, with resentment in her tone.

Lin Yun smiled because Li Daoyang was an interesting person.

“Ye Qingtian, you can’t learn from him. He’s a heartless person,” the Crane Fairy said with her lips pouted.

Lin Yun nodded and swallowed the Nine-Colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit. The moment he swallowed it, Lin Yun’s injuries began to recover. The cracks on his skin swiftly recovered, and his skin became as smooth as a baby’s. But Lin Yun wasn’t hurrying to refine it, but began practicing the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword on the summit.

Rising Sun!

Polar Opposite!

Flaming Floral Silver Tree!

Driving Lightning!

Sky Incineration Flames!

Lin Yun had already grasped six sword forms while practicing them on the summit. As time passed, the phenomena within his sword technique began to merge with the surroundings. His speed gradually slowed with his sword ray flashing, looking as though the heavens and earth were breathing, which was a mysterious feeling.

“The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint once said that the second section might look like a mess, but it follows a certain rhythm, and there’s a connection with each sword.” Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword as he practiced his sword technique, pondering what the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

As he gradually gained an insight, Lin Yun’s sword rays looked like multi-colored spheres, and each sphere had different sceneries engraved on them with a thread connecting them.

“As long as I can find this thread, it will be much easier to practice this sword technique.” Lin Yun was smart and didn’t dwell on the sword techniques, but he jumped out of it and looked at this sword technique from a different angle. He actually formed this habit from the Radiant Sword Saint. Back then, the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t teach him sword techniques on purpose when transmitting it to him. The Radiant Sword Saint only taught him calligraphy to derive the Carefree 9 Sword and practiced it with him.

This was because no matter how complicated a sword technique was, they all looked different after writing them down on a piece of paper as calligraphy. If one dwells on the sword technique too much, they would be further confused and might not have any harvest.

While Lin Yun was focused on cultivating, he forgot everything else. Li Daoyang wasn’t far from Ye Qingtian, standing beside a black-clothed old man, who was also looking at Ye Qingtian. The black-clothed old man had a noble status. He was the Dao Yang Palace’s Palace Master, Ye Qianyu. This person was also Li Daoyang’s master.

“Daoyang, what do you think of him?” Ye Qianyu asked.

Li Daoyang fell into brief thoughts because replying, “He’s strong, and he’s worthy of being a monstrous genius. Or rather, only the term monstrous genius could be worthy of him.”

“Your evaluation of him is surprisingly high,” Ye Qianyu said.

“I won’t make a mistake.” Li Daoyang’s pupils radiated with respect. “Let’s not mention his talent in sword dao, but I’m impressed by his willpower. I have never seen someone so ruthless to himself before. Not only that, but he’s also smart. You can find plenty of people with high talent, but someone like him is genuinely smart.”

Li Daoyang couldn’t help recalling the scenes of Ye Qingtian passing through the trials. When Ye Qingtian stopped to rest, he was actually tempering himself to get used to the pressure. He had to admit that Ye Qingtian was too smart, not to mention Ye Qingtian even knew how to conceal his strength, and someone like him was too rare.

“The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint wanted him to participate in the Sword Assembly. What do you think about this?” Ye Qianyu stroked his beard with a smile and seemed to be testing his beloved disciple.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Master, what do you think?” Li Daoyang asked.

“She’s a little too anxious. Ye Qingtian might obtain some results, but the Eastern Desolation’s sword dao has a huge broken lineage. If Jian Jingtian was still around, many swordsmen might rise amongst the younger generations under his influence. But the Sword Sect was suppressed too badly. Even if the six holy lands have our inheritance, we lack communication and keep them to ourselves,” Ye Qianyu smiled. “But the Sword Alliance is different because their geniuses often interact with each other. So there’s a huge difference between us and them.”

Li Daoyang didn’t deny those words and smiled, “I also know about that, but Ye Qingtian is really different. Master, willpower is more important than talent, and he has strong willpower.”

When Li Daoyang looked at Ye Qingtian from afar, his eyes shone brightly.

“Oh? Are you optimistic about him? Why don’t we make a bet, then?” Ye Qianyu smiled.

“Sure,” Li Daoyang agreed straightforwardly.

“I bet that he’ll suffer. What about you? You’re going to bet that he’ll become first?” Ye Qianyu smiled.
