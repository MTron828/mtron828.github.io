Chapter 1779 – Fame Shaking The Entire Eastern Desolation

Yan Tie’s life was no longer in his hands at this moment. His injuries were entirely recovered, and he would die if Lin Yun ever wanted him to. The surroundings fell into silence, and everyone was shocked by this scene. They had no idea what Lin Yun was trying to do, and many holy land geniuses looked at each other with their brows together, while witnessing this scene, and appeared to be pretty nervous.

Yan Tie’s face was cloudy, and a ruthless light flashed across his pupils. He coldly said, “Lin Xiao, kill me if you want. There’s no need to humiliate me like this! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“I have taken countless lives, but I have a clear conscience. I tread on the slaughtering path and admit I’m weaker than you. You can kill me, if you want.” Yan Tie said, and everyone’s faces changed when they heard that. They were filled with admiration for this swordsman.

His life was in Lin Yun’s hands, and he had no intention of submitting. He was indeed worthy of being a swordsman who grasped the Death Sword Intent. Perhaps only such an opponent could grasp the genuine Death Intent.

Everyone looked at Yan Tie with respect. In addition to the strength he previously displayed, everyone felt it would be a great pity for Yan Tie to die here.

“You and I have no grievances, so why should I kill you? I just want to tell you with this sword that you’ve taken the wrong path in your Death Sword Intent. Indeed, everyone is bound to death, but which of us aren’t seeking life in death either? Death isn’t the end, nor is slaughtering. So you think about it properly.” Lin Yun said softly.

When he finished, he pulled the Flower Burial Sword out. The pain made Yan Tie’s cheeks tremble. But just when he was about to say something, Lin Yun’s right hand fell onto his wound. As life force poured in, Yan Tie’s injuries were recovering at a visible speed.

When Lin Yun moved his hand away, his wound was perfectly healed. This surprised Yan Tie. When he raised his head, he could see the admiration in Lin Yun’s eyes, and he knew Lin Yun wasn’t trying to humiliate him. Recalling what Lin Yun said earlier, Yan Tie cupped his hands together, “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome.” Lin Yun smiled.

To be honest, Lin Yun admired Yan Tie as a swordsman. If he didn’t have the Sword Heart and Flower Burial Sword, it wouldn’t be easy for him to defeat Yan Tie. He might even have a slight chance of losing because Yan Tie grasped the Death Sword Intent, and Lin Yun didn’t grasp any high-grade sword intent.

“What is the sword in your hand called?” Yan Tie asked, watching Lin Yun sheathing his Flower Burial Sword. That should be a sword forged with the best materials. But compared to other saint swords, he could sense life within Lin Yun’s sword. This was weird because he had never seen such a saint sword before.

“You’ll know if there’s an opportunity.” Lin Yun said. The Flower Burial Sword's surface differed from other swords forged with metal. It was metallic wood and looked like a metal sword two fingers wide and four feet long. After devouring two saint runes, it was now a myriad rune saint sword.

Lin Yun had considered every factor before using his sword, and it was hard for anyone to link it with the Flower Burial Sword. A sword that’s two fingers wide and four feet long was plentiful in the Divine Dragon Era, and it was the standard size of a sword.

Yan Tie was only casually asking about it. So, instead, he asked, “How did you break my last attack?”

“I was lucky.” Lin Yun replied.

This was the first time he used the Universal Thunderstorm in an actual battle, and he had only just recently reached greater mastery in it. There was still a lot of room for improvement, and he was lucky that he could win by using it for the first time in a battle.

But it wasn’t luck that allowed him to win against Yan Tie. Even if he couldn’t break Yan Tie’s last sword, he still had other trump cards. So there was no doubt that Yan Tie would still lose in the end, but Lin Yun gained a lot of insight from the previous battle.

As for the Nine Heavenly Storm, Thunder Spike, and Universal Thunderstorm, they all had more room to improve. After this battle, his comprehension of the Azure Dragon Sword Art had undoubtedly deepened.

But Yan Tie didn’t believe what Lin Yun said. He felt that Lin Yun was comforting him and said, “I’ll fight you again after reaching the Samsara Edict Realm!”

He was still pretty confident and wanted to strengthen the Death Sword Intent after reaching the Samsara Edict Realm. Only then would the Death Dance be perfected. After all, his harvest in the Nether Sea hadn’t been fully uncovered yet.

Moreover, he had also benefited a lot from what Lin Yun said about death, and felt that he could try it. After Yan Tie returned, the Autumn Mountain Lord heaved a sigh of relief, and he announced, “Lin Xiao wins!”

After he declared that, everyone’s gazes became weird. Ji Lingfeng was pretty happy that Lin Yun could turn the tables around and win. Not to mention that the last strike was really breathtaking. He had a faint feeling that Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Art had reached a whole new level.

The Wind Edge Lord was sneering from the side, and no one knew his thoughts. But there was no doubt that he must be feeling pretty uncomfortable right now. The three young masters beside him all had different expressions on their faces. The Autumn Mountain Lord was calm and composed, the Blue Frost Lord revealed some interest in Lin Yun, and the Snow Master Lord looked at Lin Yun with a trace of fighting spirit. After all, it had been a long time since there was such a powerful swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

As for the six holy lands’ geniuses, the Myriad Lightning Sect’s Yi Feng had fighting spirits blazing within his pupils, and not even his senior disciple could calm him down.

In the pavilion belonging to the local force in Heavenly Domain City, the Wind Edge Lord looked at someone and asked, “Shi Feng, do you want to try it?”

Shi Feng was one of the three swordsmen on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, also known as the Wind Swordsman. He had an ordinary appearance, and his expression was indifferent. When he heard what the Wind Edge Lord said, he indifferently replied, “If this is his full strength, I have forty percent odds of winning. These are already the high odds of winning for a swordsman.”

No swordsman was afraid of putting their lives on the line, and forty percent was enough for them to put their lives on the line.

“But if he’s stronger than what he displayed so far, I will lose.” Shi Feng continued.

The Wind Edge Lord was surprised when he heard that, and he instantly knew Shi Feng wasn’t easy to fool. He couldn't fool Shi Feng into testing Lin Yun’s strength.

On the Thunderstorm Battlestage, Lin Yun examined himself and noticed that he had exhausted two-thirds of his dragon origin. So, he said, “I need some rest and will take my leave for now.”

When he was done, he returned to the pavilion he came from. This made many people feel regretful because they really wanted to see Lin Yun continue fighting. But they knew they couldn’t force Lin Yun to stay if he wanted to leave, not to mention that he had already underwent four battles in a row. So it would be unreasonable for them to request Lin Yun to stay.

So no one could say anything about his departure. When they looked at Lin Yun’s silhouette, their pupils were filled with admiration. After all, he had just won four high-quality battles in a row. Lin Xiao appeared out of nowhere. They thought he was a musician, but they never expected he would be such a ferocious person.

Even if he didn’t participate in any more fights, his name would cause a great sensation in the Eastern Desolation. In time, he would be a strong contender for first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

He was already so strong at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. So how strong would he become after reaching the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm? He didn’t dare to imagine it at all.

After the Nirvana Banquet, his name already caused a sensation in the Eastern Desolation. But now, he had become the undisputed strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. Thousands of swordsmen on the Dragon Pulse Ranking would respect him because of it, and this was no different from a carp jumping through the gate and transforming into a dragon.

“Where did this Lin Xiao come from? He appeared out of nowhere, and nothing was heard about him before.”

“It’s not hard to guess. He possesses the Azure Dragon Saint Physique and Azure Dragon Sword Art. So he must be a genius from a hidden Azure Dragon lineage clan.”

“There’s that possibility, but he might also have come from the even more mysterious Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. Otherwise, it’d make no sense about how he can become first on the Nirvana Banquet and even make the Three-Lives Tree bloom.”

“I call bullshit. Have you even seen anyone from the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain possessing the Azure Dragon Saint Physique and Azure Dragon Sword Art? He might be from a hidden clan of the Azure Dragon’s lineage!”

“Then how are you going to explain that someone from the Azure Dragon’s lineage can have such a high attainment in music dao that even Mei Zihua can’t defeat him?” The surroundings had constant discussions and arguments. They were all curious about Lin Yun’s identity.

They couldn’t help it because Lin Yun’s performance was too eye-catching. He was like an underdog coming out of nowhere in the Martial Dao Tea Party, and no one could neglect him. While everyone was arguing, someone asked, “Is there a possibility that he’s from a hidden clan of the Azure Dragon’s lineage, but grew up on the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain? Isn’t this the perfect explanation?”

The surroundings fell into silence because the more they thought about it, the more they felt it was possible. After all, it didn’t conflict that he came from both the Azure Dragon’s lineage and the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain.

In the Sword Sect’s pavilion, Ye Ziling looked at Lin Yun’s silhouette for a long time before she shifted her gaze away. Her expression was dark, and there was even a trace of sadness on her face.

“What’s the matter?” Mu Xueqin smiled. She asked, “Are you thinking of Junior Brother Lin? Speaking of which, Lin Xiao shares an uncanny resemblance with Junior Brother Lin, in regards to their demeanor.”

“Junior Brother Lin won’t be inferior to him, if he’s here.” Ye Ziling said softly.

“Thinking about it again, Lin Xiao and Junior Brother Lin share quite a fair bit of similarities. They both use swords and have the Azure Dragon Saint Physique." Mu Xueqin further continued, “But there are many more differences between them. Their sword techniques are different, and Junior Brother Lin has no relations with the Azure Dragon’s lineage, not to mention the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain.”

They both knew Lin Yun came from the Profound Amber Realm and only been in the Kunlun Realm for four to five years. The more they talked about Lin Yun, the sadder they became. After leaving the Ancient Barren Battlefield, they had no idea if Junior Brother Lin was still alive nor where he went.

After Lin Yun returned to his seat, Yue Weiwei asked, “Big Brother Lin, aren’t you a little too impulsive in using your sword?”

Lin Yun had no change on his face, but he knew that Yue Weiwei was worried his identity would be exposed.

“It’s okay. As long as I don’t reveal it, no one will know the sword in my hand is the Flower Burial Sword. Not to mention I’m a swordsman, to begin with. It’ll only make others suspicious if I don’t use my sword. My identity will be revealed sooner or later, so I can only try to become stronger before that so that no one dares to come after me.” Lin Yun clearly thought about it. In many cases, going into hiding wouldn’t guarantee his safety.

No matter how well he hid, being suspicious was enough for others to kill him if he had no background. After all, who would care about the life and death of an ant?

But if he put on a stronger front, it would make the other party hesitate. Even if they suspect his identity, they now had to consider simultaneously offending the Azure Dragon’s lineage and Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain.

Most importantly, it had been a long time since last he fought with his sword. Even if he was talented, he wouldn’t be able to make any progress if he only practiced by himself.

When Yue Weiwei saw that Lin Yun had already made up his mind, she merely smiled and said nothing about it. No matter what, Big Brother Lin was the best in her heart, and he was now the strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking!
