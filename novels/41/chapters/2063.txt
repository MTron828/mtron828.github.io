Chapter 2064 - Anyone Dare To Fight Me (2)

The ice phoenix looked familiar to Lin Yun, which made the corner of his lips twitch because this was Lil’ Purple’s appearance as an ice phoenix.

As the ice phoenix uttered a cry, the cry sounded ethereal, making the shackles around the giant sword tremble. When a layer of frost soon spread out from the ice phoenix and covered the shackles, fine cracks appeared on those shackles.

This scene shocked many people; even those from the Hidden Sword Manor were panicking a little at this scene.

“Tsk, tsk. The secret technique of my clan looks pretty decent, although it’s lacking.” Lil’ Purple within the Iris Secret Realm praised Gu Zijing when she saw this scene.

Gu Zijing proudly said, “This is the ancient Divine Ice Phoenix of the Divine Phoenix Clan! In ancient times, a divine phoenix wiped out the world, and this is a secret technique of my Snowfrost Saint Palace. Ye Qingtian, you can be proud to be defeated by this secret technique, and I believe you won’t have any regrets!”

“I’m surprised someone still remembers me,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes because he could sense a hint of divine aura within Gu Zijing’s sword aura under the empowerment of the ice phoenix. It looked as though the Ice Phoenix had traveled through time and was imprinted on Gu Zijing’s sword intent, making Gu Zijing’s sword intent feel ancient and resilient.

This immediately made Lin Yun feel a headache because he didn’t expect this from Gu Zijing. While the two clashed together, Lin Yun was easily being suppressed by Gu Zijing whenever he swung his sword and sword rays were flying around from their fight.

“Empowered by the Ice Phoenix and everything is nothing before the Myriad Astral Eyes. Ye Qingtian, you’ll be defeated today, even if you have the Azure Dragon Sword Heart!” Gu Zijing regained the advantage in the fight and smiled. He was confident that he could win this battle.

Seeing that Gu Zijing really knew how to act, a cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s eyes. He was losing his patience, and Gu Zijing was starting to annoy him.

“Hey, do you need my help?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“No need. Let’s not mention the Ice Emperor. Even if he’s the disciple of the Sword Emperor, I’ll defeat him today no matter what!” Lin Yun took a deep breath, and his nirvana aura filled his body under his anger. At this moment, he no longer held back and unleashed his full strength.

“Withered Tree Coming To Life!”

Lin Yun stepped forth and executed the first sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword’s second section.

“The Divine Firefly Sword? It looks like you’re finally going to give it your all. But it’s a pity I also know the Divine Firefly Sword!” Gu Zijing snorted as he faced Lin Yun’s attack head-on, with the Withered Tree Coming To Life.

Two towering trees rose from the ground when they both unleashed their attacks.

“Rising Sun!”

“Rising Sun!”

“Polar Opposite!”

“Polar Opposite!”

Neither one intended to stop as they executed one sword after another from the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword. The second section had a total of thirteen sword forms, with each sword form being stronger than the other.

Lin Yun and Gu Zijing executed the Sky Incineration Flames in the blink of an eye. As boundless flames overlapped and covered the sky, a hole was created in the sky as two terrifying sword rays clashed together.

“Intoxicating Nine Heavenly Wind!”

“Intoxicating Nine Heavenly Wind!”

But the two people under the sky had no intention of stopping as they executed the sixth sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword’s second section.

This shocked the audience in the surroundings with their mouths wide open They were all speechless when they saw this scene.

After this strike, Gu Zijing briefly stopped to catch his breath, his forehead covered in sweat.

“Sky Streak Snow!”

On the other hand, Lin Yun had no intentions of stopping and executed the seventh sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword.

“Sky Streak Snow!” Gu Zijing gritted his teeth and also executed the seventh sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword.

At this point, there was finally a gap between Lin Yun and Gu Zijing. Their attacks were no longer evenly matched. Lin Yun managed to tear apart Gu Zijing’s sword aura, and fine cracks even appeared on the Ice Phoenix behind Gu Zijing.

“I don’t believe that you know the eighth sword!” Gu Zijing gripped the sword tightly, with blood dripping from his palm.

“The eighth sword form—Four Peaceful Seas!” Lin Yun turned around and executed the eighth sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword. He had also reached the manifestation stage with the eighth sword form with starlight shining brightly.

This sword looked invincible, with four seas rising and a sword descending from the sky, and the starlight brightly lit up the world.

Gu Zijing only barely managed to block the incoming attack, but he had retreated to the lake's edge. Taking this attack, the Ice Phoenix behind him also began to shatter.

“This is impossible!” Gu Zijing widened his eyes with disbelief because this was already the eighth sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword.

“How is this possible?!” Feng Shaoyu and Zhao Wuji nearly bounced up from their seats in the palace. Even Jiang Yunting had widened his mouth in disbelief.

But that wasn’t all. Lin Yun turned around and executed the ninth sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword—Moon Reflection Mirror.

As afterimages and space began to overlap, every space was like a mirror with a figure reflected in each mirror. The nine stars behind Gu Zijing exploded when Lin Yun unleashed his attack. At the same time, a huge hole appeared in Gu Zijing’s chest. This attack nearly pierced through him.

The Flower Burial Sword began to tremble in Lin Yun’s hands as a powerful sword aura was being poured into this sword, radiating with a powerful aura.

On the other hand, Gu Zijing’s face was ashen because he noticed that Ye Qingtian didn’t fully unleash that last attack. Ye Qingtian had only used a small amount of power of the Moon Reflection Mirror to pierce through his chest.

“I lost…” Gu Zijing said in a trembling tone, and his words shattered the hearts of the disciples from the Sword Alliance.

“At least you’re smart,” Lin Yun snorted and swung his sword, releasng the power of the Moon Reflection Mirror, shattering the nine shackles in the sky.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As Lin Yun stood on the giant sword, he swept his gaze around, his sword intent trembling within the Flower Burial Sword. He was like a monarch at this moment, as though he was asking if anyone dared to fight him!
