Chapter 1762 – Why Not?

They headed towards the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s Sky Palace when they left the room. The Sky Palace was at the summit of Nirvana Mountain, shrouded in clouds and mist.

This was the forbidden zone of the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion, and no one could set foot there without permission. Just when Lin Yun and Mu Xueling were about to reach the foot of the Nirvana Pavilion, they were blocked by Mei Zihua and his maids.

“Saint Elder.” Mei Zihua still had the same demeanor as before, holding onto a fan in his hand and greeting Mu Xueling.

After Mu Xueling nodded her head in acknowledgment, Mei Zihua turned to Lin Yun with a smile. He asked, “Lin Xiao, how long will you stay in the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion?”

“I’m not too sure. Three to five days, if I’m fast.” Lin Yun replied.

“That long?” Mei Zihua furrowed his brows, and unhappily said, “There’s nothing to see in the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion. I’m afraid that I won’t stay here for long. The Heavenly Domain City has been bustling recently, so I’ll wait for you there.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun responded.

With a smile, Mei Zihua said, “Don’t forget what you previously promised me. The Black Tortoise Void Sea is pretty bustling these days, and I might be going there. I can only wait for you in Heavenly Domain City for a month.”

Now that Lin Yun thought about it, the Black Tortoise Void Sea should have been bustling long ago. If he remembered correctly, An Liuyan should be here for the Black Tortoise Void Sea. Was the sea really related to the Black Tortoise’s inheritance?

If that was the case, he might also have to go there. The tortoiseshell in his hand had an extraordinary origin, and he speculated that it must have something to do with the Black Tortoise’s inheritance.

“I can’t give you a confirmed timing, so I can only do my best. I can give you the scores first.” Lin Yun took out three jade slips and handed them to Mei Zihua. He had already prepared them over the past two days and would have looked for Mei Zihua even if the latter didn’t look for him.

Taking possession of the jade slips, Mei Zihua said, “Let me borrow the spike fiddle and play with it.”

But Lin Yun turned to look at Mu Xueling when he heard that because the spike fiddle didn’t belong to him. Seeing this, Mei Zihua’s expression also became grave, and he dropped his smile.

This made Lin Yun surprised because Mei Zihua, in his impression, was arrogant and didn’t even give the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master any face. But he could tell that Mei Zihua was pretty respectful to Mu Xueling, or rather, fearful.

“So the spike fiddle belongs to Saint Elder. I apologize for my request earlier.” Mei Zihua said humbly.

Mu Xueling still wore an indifferent expression as before, but said without even batting an eye at Mei Zihua, “You can make the decision.”

Since she wasn’t bothered about it, Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t be bothered either. He straightforwardly handed the erhu to Mei Zihua.

“Interesting.” Mei Zihua received the erhu and briefly examined Lin Yun before he smiled, “I have lost to you at Dual Moon Lake. If you don’t want my maids, I’ll give you something else.”

After he was done speaking, he handed a jade slip to Lin Yun.

“What is it?” Lin Yun casually asked.

“Some cultivation techniques related to the Vermilion Bird Constellation, the Divine Snow Plum Touch, and the ancient scores I played that day.” Mei Zihua casually replied. He smiled, “Most importantly, there are some of my comprehensions in music dao.”

Mei Zihua had a severe narcissistic condition. His comprehension of music dao should be the least important when compared to the Divine Snow Plum Touch and Vermilion Bird Constellation.

“Okay. I’ll accept them.” Lin Yun calmly put the jade slip away.

“We’ll meet again in Heavenly Domain City, then.” Mei Zihua smiled and waved his hand. Before leaving, his nine maids glanced at Lin Yun and gave him an amorous look.

“He seems to be a little afraid of you.” Lin Yun said as they climbed the mountain.

“Aren't you?” Mu Xueling replied.

Lin Yun was briefly taken aback when he heard that because it made sense, but something felt wrong somehow.

In the Sky Palace, the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master, Jiang Li, had been waiting for a long time. Aside from him, there were six other elders in the palace, and they were all saints. Upon seeing Mu Xueling, Jiang Li was briefly surprised before he calmed down.

“Greetings, Pavilion Master.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together.

“You don’t have to be so polite.” Jiang Li turned to look at Mu Xueling and smiled, “Saint Elder, do you mind leaving for a while? I have private matters about the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion to talk to him about.”

“I’m afraid not.” Mu Xueling replied.

As the pavilion master, Jiang Li was briefly stunned before figuring out what was happening. He turned to Lin Yun and smiled, “Understood. It’s fine to be a little more cautious. It looks like the Wind God Order is in Young Master Lin’s hands now?”

Nodding his head, Lin Yun took out the Wind God Order.

“Can I take a look at it?” When Jiang Li saw the Wind God Order, flames began to blaze within his pupils.

Waving his hand in response, the Wind God Order flew toward Jiang Li. The latter briefly examined the medal, before gradually becoming excited. “It really is the Wind God Order!”

He followed up with passing it to the six elders. When the six elders examined the Wind God Order, they were shocked because the Wind God Order was lost for a hundred thousand years.

When the Dragon Gate fell, the Azure Dragon’s lineage scattered throughout the Kunlun Realm and remained dormant. A significant portion of the reason was that they didn’t have the Wind God Order to fuse into the Divine Azure Order.

According to the speech of the Azure Dragon Lord, only those with the Divine Azure Order could command the entire Azure Dragon’s lineage. Only the Divine Azure Order could open the Azure Dragon’s lineage treasury.

After a while, Jiang Li returned the Wind God Order to Lin Yun and asked, “Young Master Lin, do you know the origin and usage of the Wind God Order.”

Nodding his head, Lin Yun shared his experience in obtaining the Wind God Order. Jiang Li and the six elders were shocked when they heard what he said. Jiang Li murmured, “So, you’re Flower Burial Lin Yun?”

Lin Yun circulated the Divine Tortoise Transformation and returned to his original appearance. Jiang Li and the six elders were shocked when they saw Lin Yun’s appearance. They exclaimed, “It’s really you!”

But their facial expressions soon became complicated. After all, Lin Yun possessed the Sovereign Saint Artifact, Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, and the ancient treasure, the Firmament Saint Cloth.

Just the three words ‘Sovereign Saint Artifact’ was enough to tempt the hearts of saints, not to mention the Firmament Saint Cloth. Not even the Radiant Sword Saint could protect his safety when it appeared. It also took Jiang Li a long time to calm down and crush the thoughts he shouldn’t have.

“I have no intentions of becoming the Azure Dragon Lord.” Lin Yun said. “I’m here to make a deal. I can give the Wind God Order to you guys, and I only want a promise.”

The six elders looked at each other and were surprised. Lin Yun said he wasn’t interested in the position of the Azure Dragon Lord?

Jiang Li briefly pondered before he said, “We’re not in a hurry to talk about that, for now. The Azure Dragon’s lineage has been scattered throughout the Kunlun Realm for a hundred thousand years. In order for the Divine Azure Order to appear, we must hold a Dragon Selection Ceremony in Ancient Azure Dragon City. Tell me your request first.”

“I hope that one day, if I start a conflict with the Profound Sky Sect, you guys will stand on my side.” Lin Yun bluntly said.

Hearing what he said, Jiang Li and the six elders were silent because they naturally knew about the grudges between Flower Burial and Tian Xuanzi. Jiang Li asked, “The Ancient Barren Domain’s Profound Sky Sect?”

“That’s right.” Lin Yun replied. He might seem calm, but he was pretty nervous because he could do nothing about it, even if they refused.

“The Profound Sky Sect is fine because it ultimately cannot be compared to holy lands. But Tian Xuanzi isn’t simple, and there aren’t many in this world who dare to make a move against him.” An elder said with a grave expression.

“That’s right. When traveling in the Eastern Desolation, he swept through his path and had few opponents.”

“He has a complicated relationship with the Divine Dragon Empire. All the ancient domains except for the Ancient Barren Domain are now under the control of the Divine Dragon Empire. If the Ancient Barren Domain wasn’t related to Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng, the Ancient Barren Domain would’ve fallen into the Divine Dragon Empire’s control a long time ago…” Another elder said.

Those of the Azure Dragon’s lineage naturally knew more about the Ancient Barren Domain than Lin Yun. Jiang Li looked at Lin Yun and said, “if Tian Xuanzi wants to come after you, the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion can ensure your safety, and you don’t have to use the Wind God Order to exchange for it. You’re the first at the Nirvana Banquet, so you can request with me. But it might be a little troublesome if you want to make a move against Tian Xuanzi…”

“The Azure Dragon’s lineage is also afraid of the Profound Sky Sect?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s not the problem, and there are many things you don’t know about. The Sword Sect will be destroyed the moment the Radiant Sword Saint dies. At that time, standing in the way of the Profound Sky Sect is equivalent to becoming an enemy of the Divine Dragon Empire.” Jiang Li said.

“He’s right. When Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng sliced off two peaks from the Sword Sect, he promised that no Emperor Realm experts would move against the Sword Sect as long as the Radiant Sword Saint was around.” Mu Xueling said. “But if the Radiant Sword Saint dies, his promise will be invalidated, and the Divine Dragon Empire will be able to take over the entire Kunlun Realm.”

“So you all feel my master won’t be able to take that step out?” Lin Yun smiled bitterly.

“That path that he takes is too difficult.” Jiang Li said, looking at Lin Yun. “If he wants to become an Emperor, he could’ve done it long ago. You don’t understand your master. Back then, he faced three holy lands with his sword, guarding the Ancient Barren Domain for three thousand years. The path that he takes is to compete with the Nine Emperors!

“Besides, he doesn’t have much life span left, and you don’t have to be so persistent. Everyone is a mortal in the Divine Dragon Era. Even someone as strong as the Nine Emperors will die one day. Your master seeks the great dao with his life on the line and has no regrets. My father has some relationship with your master, and I understand your master’s character. If I’m not wrong, he’s also against you returning to the Ancient Barren Domain. You don’t need to be an enemy of Tian Xuanzi.”

“What if I insist on becoming his enemy, then?!” A sharp light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils.

Jiang Li and others were taken aback by Lin Yun’s answer, and didn’t know how to respond. A long time later, Jiang Li said, “If you insist on doing so, you will lose your life. After you die, the Wind God Order will no longer have an owner.”

But Lin Yun shook his head and replied, “Since Big Brother wanted me to come, he definitely hoped that I could hand the Wind God Order over to those of the Azure Dragon’s lineage. You guys don’t have to wait for it to become an item without an owner before taking it.”

He was straightforward and left after placing the Wind God Order on the table. This stunned Jiang Li before he came to his senses and said, “Young lad, do you mind staying on the island for a few more days?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I guess.” Lin Yun casually replied without turning back.

After he left, an old man with an ancient rune on his forehead walked out. He gave off a horrifying aura like he could destroy the world with a glance.

“Old Patriarch!”

“Father.” Jiang Li and the elders quickly stepped forth.

But the old man was looking in the direction Lin Yun left and said, “He’s worthy of becoming the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple with his stubborn temper. Jiang Li, go to the last floor of the Heavenly Nirvana Treasury and retrieve three Azure Dragon Saint Treasures for him.”

“Ah?” Jiang Li was shocked. “Is that necessary? He just said that he has no interest in the position of the Azure Dragon Lord.”

“He’s not going to compete for it just because he says so? He’s only at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm and dares to challenge Tian Xuanzi. So why will the Azure Dragon’s lineage fear becoming enemies with the Divine Dragons?” The old man said indifferently. His words naturally made everyone shocked, and their pupils were filled with disbelief.
