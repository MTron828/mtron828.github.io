Chapter 2466 - Two Swords

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint said in a trembling tone, not because he was afraid but because he had become anxious. He initially thought that Jian Jue could prove his strength against Lin Yun even if he couldn’t defeat the latter. But he didn’t expect Lin Yun to toy around with Jian Jue in the palm of his hand.

Most importantly, Lin Yun even wore an innocent expression. Just when he thought that Chu Liang could turn the tables around, it turned out that he couldn’t even force Lin Yun to draw his sword and was toyed around like how Lin Yun toyed around with Jian Jue.

If they didn’t know any better, they would’ve thought that Lin Yun came to smash the scene. Even when four Great Saints stepped forward, they were still sent flying by Lin Yun.

Hearing what the Dao Suspend Sword Saint said, Lin Yun was baffled because he didn’t know how to reply.

Seeing Lin Yun wasn’t replying, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint repeated, “Young lad, I’m not bullying you to fight you, right?”

Lin Yun came to his senses and smiled, “Since I’ve said that anyone can challenge me, you’re naturally not bullying me. But I hope that senior can show mercy as this is only a friendly spar.”

Everyone from the Skysolute City’s lineage heaved in relief because Lin Yun appeared humble.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint smiled, “Flower Burial, you’re being too humble. You didn’t look to be holding back earlier.”

Lin Yun smiled bitterly because he didn’t do it on purpose. When he fought Jian Jue, he noticed a massive difference in their strength. He was close to dao, while Jian Jue still differentiated between fast and slow swords. Even when Chu Liang stood out, he only felt a hint of threat coming from the latter.

Chu Liang might have had higher cultivation than him, but there was a vast difference in their understanding of sword dao. As for the four Great Saints, Lin Yun just wanted to see how powerful his sword aura had become; he didn’t expect them to be so weak.

These people were much weaker than Tian Xuanzi. As for the current Lin Yun, he could fight Tian Xuanzi even without relying on the Firmament Saint Cloth.

“I apologize in advance then.” The Dao Suspend Sword Saint appeared on the stage. He smiled, “Since Flower Burial isn’t in a hurry to draw your sword, why don’t we have a few exchanges with our fists?”

Lin Yun didn’t even use his sword in the past and defeated many experts of the Skysolute City’s lineage. So, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint was naturally furious, and his goal was to force Lin Yun to draw his sword.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint moved when he finished, slowly approaching Lin Yun. He was using Space Dao, and many swordsmen present noticed it. It wasn’t a movement technique but Space Dao.

When Dao Suspend Sword Saint disappeared again, Lin Yun was calm because Tian Xuanzi was also an expert in Space Dao, and he already had experience facing someone proficient in Space Dao.

Yin-Yang Dao combined with the Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent, forming the Yin-Yang Sword Domain and strengthening the surrounding space. The Dao Suspend Sword Saint was swift, but his speed became slow under Lin Yun’s sword domain.

Lin Yun and Dao Suspend Sword Saint threw a punch together as the Yin-Yang Sword Domain and Space Sword Domain began to overlap before exploding. They might be fighting with their bare hands, but their foundation came from their sword domain. Lin Yun was sent flying a hundred meters away, sensing a ferocious power.

On the other hand, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint’s clothes and hair fluttered. He didn’t budge from the impact, and this showed the terrifying foundation of his Space Sword Domain.

Dao Suspend Sword Saint didn’t move as space energy spread out, causing the surrounding space to sweep like water.

This made the Thousand Plume Great Saint exclaim, “Holy shit!”

Ye Guhan smiled, “Senior Dao Suspend is a little petty.”

Exclamations sounded in the plaza, and even a fool could tell that the Dao Suspend Sword Saint wanted to do what Lin Yun did to others and toy with him.

Just when everyone thought to themselves, Lin Yun could sense it as he flew out. Space was like a tornado trying to drag him back, and he realized that the Dao Suspend Sword Saint was genuinely furious.

But Lin Yun smiled because trying to drag him back with Space Dao wasn’t enough. When he clasped his hands together, he began to manifest Yin-Yang Dao. Yin and Yang were like two fishes chasing after each other. When the Yin-Yang diagram appeared, Lin Yun’s figure became firm, like an unmovable mountain.

Not only was Lin Yun not dragged back by space, but he also carried on flying back. Lin Yun smiled because that wasn’t all, as the various runes appeared on the diagram, forming a painting behind him.

This time, Lin Yun broke free from the Dao Suspend Sword Saint’s restraint and even grasped the upper hand in the competition of Eternal Daos. This left everyone dumbfounded, looking at Lin Yun, who wore a smile on his face.

“Have a taste of it too!” Lin Yun laughed as he reached forward and tugged. The Yin-Yang diagram behind him exploded like flowers dispersing before they revolved; the Eternal Dao he gave off also peaked. This caught the Dao Suspend Sword Saint by surprise, and was dragged over.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint’s face changed, and he roared, “Boundless Greater Dao!”

He clasped his hands together with sword ray blooming on him, releasing his Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent that had reached lesser mastery. The ground trembled when he landed on the ground, and an ordinary plaza would’ve long collapsed from the impact.

All the swordsmen present wore a grave expression. This wasn’t a barehanded spar but a clash in dao. Now that they looked at it, Jian Jue’s loss was justified. In reality, Jian Jue’s face had long turned pale, with his body trembling.

“You’re truly extraordinary. I’m becoming serious now!” Dao Suspend Sword Saint wore a grave expression and treated Lin Yun as an opponent comparable to him.

“Come on!” Lin Yun cupped his fists together.

As Dao Suspend Sword Saint’s clothes began to flutter, he appeared before Lin Yun. When he stood before Lin Yun, a crack appeared in space as he pushed his palm forward, suppressing Lin Yun down when the latter took his attack head-on.

Not allowing Lin Yun to catch his breath, Dao Suspend Sword Saint unleashed a barrage of attacks, forcing Lin Yun to keep retreating.

Lin Yun’s heart pumped rapidly, and each blow made him feel as though he was about to throw a mouthful of blood with rumbling sounds coming from his internal organs. But Lin Yun grit his teeth because he discovered that whenever he took a blow, the remnant energies from the Heavenly Dragon Bone would be refined, and the essence deep in the Heavenly Dragon Bone was slowly guided out.

Discovering this, Lin Yun grits his teeth and endures the incoming attacks. This made Dao Suspend Sword Saint frown. He might’ve held back because his cultivation was higher than Lin Yun, but he soon noticed that something wasn’t right because Lin Yun even wore a painful expression, which gave him a feeling that he could destroy Lin Yun’s body if he exerted more force.

But no matter how he attacked, Lin Yun wouldn’t fall. Seeing this, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint no longer held back in his punches. His face soon changed after discovering something wasn’t right because Lin Yun’s complexion was slowly becoming rosy under the attacks.

“Senior, there’s no need to hold back!” Lin Yun said anxiously.

All the swordsmen were dumbfounded; they had never seen someone so arrogant.

Dao Suspend Sword Saint’s face turned black and no longer held back. Each of his punches could even shatter space, and they landed on Lin Yun.

Fifteen minutes later, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint gasped for breath with beads of sweat rolling from his forehead. He roared, “Are you messing with me?! Draw your sword!”

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint was genuinely furious now, unleashing his full cultivation in the pinnacle Great Saint Realm after seeing that Lin Yun still had no intentions of drawing his sword. But just when this punch was about to land on Lin Yun, the latter reached out and grabbed onto his punch.

This surprised the Dao Suspend Sword Saint. Just when he was baffled, a dragon’s roar echoed from within Lin Yun’s body. In the next second, a dazzling radiance shone on Lin Yun with his cultivating rising to the Boundless Stage of the Great Saint Realm.

A dragon’s roar echoed from within Lin Yun’s body, and his cultivation began to rise, leaving the Dao Suspend Sword Saint dumbfounded.

“Go back!” Exerting force, Lin Yun unleashed the power of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique and cultivation in the Boundless Stage, sending the Dao Suspend Sword Saint back.

“Senior, thank you for helping me to refine the Heavenly Dragon Bone!” Lin Yun laughed as he felt energized, wanting to vent out the energies in his body. When the Dao Suspend Sword Saint landed on the ground, Lin Yun charged over, unleashing a barrage of attacks.

Lin Yun was using the Sovereign Dragon Fist by instinct. This was known to be the strongest fist technique, and the power was now brought to a new level. The Dao Suspend Sword Saint was forced to the point that he couldn’t retaliate and could only defend himself.

Lin Yun’s cultivation continued to rise, soon reaching the pinnacle of Boundless Stage ten-odd moves later.

“Sword!” Dao Suspend Sword Saint roared. While retreating, he had to summon his sword, which hung on the highest pavilion in the Skysolute City. A sword soon flew over, and this was the famous Sovereign Saint Artifact of Skysolute City, the Heavenly Que Sword.

“That’s Heavenly Que!”

“It has been nine hundred years since it was last unsheathed, right?”

“What a powerful sword!” When the Heavenly Que Sword flew over, the sky began to change as all the swordsmen present could feel their swords trembling, which drew their exclamation.

“My sword is also sharp!” Lin Yun laughed as the Flower Burial Sword flew out from his chest, producing a mighty gale that forced everyone to shut their eyes.

The Flower Burial Sword and Heavenly Que Sword released a dazzling radiance in the sky.
