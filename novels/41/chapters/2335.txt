Chapter 2336 - Kill

So, it turns out that if the sword is too fast, it really won’t hurt. That was the last thought Heavenly Wood had before he died.

When Heavenly Wood’s head fell, it rolled on the ground, with everyone widening their eyes with disbelief. When they looked at Lin Yun again, their eyes were filled with disbelief. The chiefs of the Azure Cloud Realm looked at Lin Yun with disbelief, while Ao Jue and Mu Xuehan exchanged a gaze. Lin Yun was too terrifying.

If Ghost Owl and Thunderhawk were careless to be defeated and couldn’t figure out Lin Yun’s strength, Heavenly Wood was the eldest brother and the most potent amongst the four. But he was defeated by Lin Yun. Most importantly, they could only see a blurred trajectory in that last sword that was unleashed by Lin Yun.

“Isn’t this a little too terrifying?” Xiong Tiannan gulped down a mouthful of saliva and was shocked. He was a little afraid and felt fortunate that didn’t make a move when he tailed Lin Yun. If he made a move, he might have died without knowing why. Just thinking about it was enough to cover Xiong Tiannan in a cold sweat.

As for Lin Jiangtian, she was also shocked, with her mouth slightly opened in surprise. Even if she had expected Lin Yun to be strong, she never imagined that Lin Yun would be so powerful. As for Chang Jun and Xi Ruo, who mocked Lin Yun earlier, they were so frightened that they didn’t dare to say a word.

Xi Ruo regretted this moment, and muttered, “Why didn’t I notice that he’s so strong? Furthermore, he even tried to get close to me earlier.”

Wu Yuhua was having difficulty enduring his laughter and glanced at Xi Ruo. Does she think that she is a peerless beauty? He naturally wouldn’t believe Lin Yun would be attracted to Xi Ruo since they weren’t on the same level.

Right then, applause attracted everyone’s attention and they saw that Wang Jue was smiling, “It looks like Xin Wuhen wasn’t lying. You do have Golden Dao Fruits, and I believe it now.”

When he said that, everyone finally recalled that there was still the divine disciple, so Lin Yun wasn’t entirely safe yet.

Wang Jue made a move and Heavenly Wood’s headless corpse was dragged over, with his head placed back on it. When he reached out and put his hand on the head of Heavenly Wood’s corpse, it began to heal. Heavenly Wood’s vitality was slowly being restored before he reopened his eyes.

Everyone’s hearts trembled as they became shocked by this scene. It was unbelievable that someone who died came back to life. Although everyone knew that the life force of Saints was vital and Heavenly Wood wasn’t entirely dead, it was unbelievable that someone could recover from having his head decapitated so quickly.

Lin Yun squinted and recognized that Wang Jue used Life Dao. Aside from that, Wang Jue forcibly removed the Divine Light Sword Intent lingering in Heavenly Wood’s head. This might be impressive, but Lin Yun could also achieve it. But it was terrifying that Wang Jue removed his Divine Light Sword Intent with a wave of his hand. This meant that Wang Jue had grasped at least one Sovereign Dao!

At the same time, Thunderhawk’s injuries were also recovered under Wang Jue’s means, leaving everyone in the surrounding area dumbfounded. Everyone wore a grave expression as they looked at Wang Jue, who intimidated everyone with this move on purpose.

After all, saving a dead person and someone who was dying was stronger than killing them.

“Young Master!” Thunderhawk and Heavenly Wood had guilt on their faces when they reopened their eyes. “Young Master, you have to take revenge for us! Don’t let him go!”

Wang Jue waved his hand, “The two of you focus on treating your injuries.”ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xin Wuhen’s eyes lit up at this scene with a smile rising on his pale complexion. He said respectfully, “As expected of a divine disciple. Brother Wang has really shocked us greatly! With Brother Wang’s means, I believe you will be able to suppress everyone and reach the summit of the saint mountain.”

Xin Wuhen flattered Wang Jue. He was intimidated by Lin Yun, and wanted to use Wang Jue’s hands to get rid of Lin Yun.

“Brother Wang, he has more than one Golden Dao Fruit!” Xin Wuhen viciously looked at Lin Yun.

“Is he right?” Wang Jue smiled. “If you hand the Golden Dao Fruits to me, I can forgive you for what happened earlier, and I can even let you enter the saint mountain with me.”

Everyone in the surroundings began to discuss amongst themselves because the condition given by Wang Jue was pretty attractive.

Lin Yun had no change on his face, before he smiled, “You’re right. I do have Golden Dao Fruits with me.”

He let go of the Flower Burial Sword with his right hand. As the sword hovered around him, a golden radiance shone from Lin Yun’s hand and nine Golden Dao Fruits appeared. This made everyone stare at them with their eyes wide open and looking dumbfounded. Even Ao Jue and Mu Xiuhan were dumbfounded.

“How is this possible?”

“Oh my god, it’s really the Golden Dao Fruits!”

“Nine Golden Dao Fruits! How did he manage to do it?”

“No one has obtained a Golden Dao Fruit before in the history of the Sovereign Monument!”

Everyone from the Azure Cloud Realm was dumbfounded. It was even more shocking than when Lin Yun killed Heavenly Wood earlier. After all, those were nine Golden Dao Fruits, and this was unprecedented.

“Fuck!” Xin Wuhan couldn’t help cursing because he never expected Lin Yun to take out nine Golden Dao Fruits.

“Holy shit… How is that possible? Are those really Golden Dao Fruits?” Xiong Tiannan couldn’t help exclaiming.

Lin Jiangxian’s gaze became sharp, “Those are really Golden Dao Fruits.”

Everyone’s gaze was attracted to the Golden Dao Fruits with greed, shock, and envy. Only Ji Zixi knew what Lin Yun wanted to do when he took out the Golden Dao Fruits. No one here knew about Lin Yun better than her. Lin Yun was someone willing to give away a treasure like the Golden Dao Fruit if he took a liking to someone, just like how he gave her the divine flame fragment in the Heavenly Void.

But if someone wanted to forcibly snatch them away, Lin Yun wouldn’t give them any face, even if it was a divine disciple. She wouldn’t let anyone hurt Lin Yun, not even a divine disciple. Thinking about this, murderous intent and a chilling aura flashed across Ji Zixi’s eyes.

“Ha, so what if you have nine Golden Dao Fruits? So what if you killed my big brother? In the end, you’re still going to hand them over, not to mention that my big brother will also be able to make a breakthrough in his strength through this fight,” Ray Serpent sneered with contempt in his eyes.

When the other cultivators in the Azure Cloud Realm heard that, they sighed and heaved a sigh in relief. They believed that Lin Yun would hand the Golden Dao Fruits over. This meant that Wang Jue wouldn’t go after their dao fruits anymore.

As for Wang Jue, he looked excited because he needed the Golden Dao Fruits, and they attracted his gaze.

“You want them?” Lin Yun wore a playful smile.

“Hand them over. You can follow me in the future,” Wang Jue said pridefully.

With a contemptuous smile, Lin Yun tossed the Golden Dao Fruits to the sky, and smiled, “Come and take them, if you want.”

The nine Golden Dao Fruits were tossed to the sky, attracting countless gazes since no one expected this scene. But they didn’t notice that after Lin Yun threw the Golden Dao Fruits, he raised his left hand to his waist and shot two sword rays, blowing Thunderhawk and Heavenly Wood apart.

The two had just been brought back to life and could make a breakthrough in their strength, but they died a terrible death in the next moment. When everyone raised their heads, they heard a loud explosion before they could even respond.

This was too stimulating and everyone’s minds became blank and couldn’t recover from their shock even after a long time.

“Heavenly Wood! Thunderhawk!” Wang Jue could no longer care about the Golden Dao Fruits and his face changed at the death of his two Azure Divine Guards. The two followed him for a long time, and he placed great hopes on them.

“Big Brother! Second Brother!” Ghost Owl and Ray Serpent exclaimed. Ray Serpent’s face had turned green since he had mocked Lin Yun earlier.

But while everyone was shocked by Heavenly Wood and Thunderhawk’s deaths, Lin Yun performed the Azure Dragon’s Grasp and dragged Xin Wuhen over. With a clench, Xin Wuhen’s head was crushed.

Everything took place in the blink of an eye before anyone could respond. When everyone recovered from the shock, they finally realized that Lin Yun had planned everything, and he was messing around with Wang Jue right from the beginning.

When Lin Yun took out the Golden Dao Fruits, he already had everything planned. After everyone recalled Lin Yun’s smile, they felt a chill run down their spines with their faces changing.

“Die!” Wang Jue appeared before Lin Yun and pushed his palm forth.

When Lin Yun clashed with Wang Jue head-on, he instantly felt that his sword intent and saint energy were being suppressed—the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron then flew out the next moment to withstand the pressure, but it only lasted for a brief moment before fine cracks appeared on the cauldron, with Lin Yun taking a few steps back. This had never happened before.

Ji Zixi’s face changed, and she immediately came over to Lin Yun. Seeing that Wang Jue wanted to come again, Xiong Tiannan and Lin Jiangxian made a move to stop him.

“Watch out!” Lin Yun warned. But it was already too late. Xiong Tiannan and Lin Jiangxian were sent flying away after an exchange.

Wang Jue gave out a dazzling radiance along with a powerful aura, causing the entire Qilin Mountain to tremble. The aura that he gave off was at the seventh-stage Saint Lord.
