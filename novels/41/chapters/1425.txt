Chapter 1426 - Great Sun Subduing Palm

The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord’s words echoed like a thunderclap and made Lin Yun feel goosebumps all over his body. He could feel his heart pumping violently as blood raced through his veins. He was surprised by his emotions because it had been a long time since his heart was so pumped. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

So, he was wrong right from the start. The Radiant Sword Saint had already acknowledged him as a disciple back on the Heavenly Path when he faced Jin Jue of the Profound Sky Sect. He was accepted by the Sword Sect when the eight sects didn’t want him.

Since he was already accepted, how could he be accepted again? He was already the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, it’s just that he didn’t know it. The moment he stepped into the Kunlun Realm and Feng Jue made him call him ‘Senior Brother,’ he was already stamped with the name of the Radiant Sword Saint from thereon.

This made Lin Yun laugh at himself for having such a weak heart.

“Do you dare to fight him?” While Lin Yun was in deep thought, the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord’s voice resounded once more.

Everyone else could feel chills running down their spines because they could sense the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord’s rage.

As Lin Yun raised his head, he replied, “Why wouldn’t I dare? I’ve been wanting to fight him since long ago.”

“Good! I don’t need you to win; I just need you to show this person that even if the Sword Sect’s disciples aren’t talented, we have no need for someone as despicable and shameless as him! My Sword Sect’s disciples can have nothing, but they can’t lose their backbone!” said the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord with his voice echoing throughout the mountain.

“Lin Yun will do his best. I’ll ensure that the Sword Sect won’t be humiliated by anyone!” Lin Yun clenched his right fist. He had never wanted to win a fight as much as he did now. So even if he had to reveal his trump cards, he was determined to put Xiahou Yan under his foot.

Everyone quickly dispersed from the stage and even emptied from the vast ground for Lin Yun and Xiahou Yan to fight.

“Haha. The pride of the Sword Sect has to depend on someone like him?” Xiahou Yan’s face was terrifyingly cold, and he sneered, “After today’s fight, I’ll tell the world that not only does the Sword Sect not have any backbone, they’re even blind! The Radiant Sword Saint is nothing but a false reputation. Today, I, Xiahou Yan, will sweep over all of the saints’ disciples with my sword!”

They came to the center of the stage, standing a hundred meters apart. Since the commotion caused here was too great, the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord’s voice reached the sect. This instantly drew the attention of countless Sword Sect disciples and they flew over. They were shocked when they looked at the stage from afar.

“Boss Huang, can my elder brother win?” Xiahou Yun was terrified by this scene as he cautiously asked.

Huang Yancheng’s face was calm as he replied, “It’s a fight between a Heavenly Elysium Core Realm and a Lesser Elysium Core Realm. So what do you think? Not to mention that your brother also has the Innate Sword Physique, Innate Sword Heart, and Firmament Sword Intent. So Lin Yun is just asking to be humiliated by fighting your elder brother.”

Chen Bing smiled from the side. “Don’t worry. We just have to watch and see how Lin Yun dies. The Sword Sect found a good solution. They aren’t seeking victory in this fight? How naive. Xiahou Yan is a lot stronger than they have imagined. The Sword Sect will be able to take a step back as long as Lin Yun forces Xiahou Yan to use 70% of his strength, but do you think that’s possible?”

Xiahou Yun breathed a sigh of relief when he heard Chen Bing and Huang Yancheng’s words. When he looked at Lin Yun, his eyes flashed with a sinister light. He wanted to see how Lin Yun would die. Lin Yun made him act like a clown being toyed with during the second round, but he had been holding back the grudge till now.

“Lin Yun…” Ye Ziling and the others who were accepted by the saints looked at Lin Yun with worry. It wasn’t because they weren’t optimistic about him, but that this was a tough battle. Xiahou Yan was a famous figure amongst the younger generation, not to mention that he was in the top three thousandths on the Elysium Core Ranking.

This was such a high ranking that even Jiang Chen and others had heard of Xiahou Yan’s name outside of the Ancient Barren Domain. Ye Ziyun also looked at Lin Yun, but she couldn’t say a word. Rather, she wore a solemn expression and didn’t notice that Lin Yun had already been imprinted in her heart. She played tricks throughout her life and tricked herself this time.

Those who newly joined the Sword Sect also looked at Lin Yun, praying for his victory. All of them were young, and they were furious when they heard what Xiahou Yan said. Xiahou Yan’s arrogance made many people grit their teeth.

“Make your move. I’m curious to see what makes you think you’re comparable to Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng,” Lin Yun said.

Looking at Lin Yun, Xiahou Yan wore a smile and calmed down. But there wasn’t any warmth in his smile, only indifference and killing intent. “I’ll let that old geezer, the Radiant Sword Saint, know how blind he is when you kneel before me in a while!”

When he was done, everyone could see a torrential astral energy surging from his body, bringing along a strong pressure that enveloped the entire stage. The pressure changed many people’s faces because they could feel how powerful it was. Xiahou Yan’s aura was only at the first-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, but it was already comparable to a two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. This meant he could easily defeat ordinary two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm geniuses.

“What powerful cultivation!” Those newly joined disciples couldn’t help exclaiming when they sensed Xiahou Yan’s aura.

But Lin Yun wasn’t surprised when he sensed his astral energy and the innate saint aura. Xiahou Yan was the prince of the Xiahou Saint Clan, not to mention that he even possessed the Innate Sword Physique and Innate Sword Heart. So it wasn’t surprising that Xiahou Yan would have such a powerful cultivation.

As dragon runes began appearing on the surface of Lin Yun’s body, the sky turned dark with a thunderstorm raging. The azure dragon aura also lifted Lin Yun’s body into the air. His astral energy might not be as strong as Xiahou Yan's, but his physique had reached an unbelievable height. The sheer power within his body made the surrounding air tremble. It was as if he was a genuine dragon at this moment.

Such a powerful physique was rare even amongst the Dragon Pulse Realm experts. Apart from Qin Cang, who had the Golden Dragon Bone, Lin Yun had no fear of facing those in the same generation.

“Not bad. At least this means that you can take more of my beatings!” Xiahou Yan smirked.

“It’s also painful to beat others,” Lin Yun said while he stretched his fingers.

“Heh…” Xiahou Yan smiled before he plunged his sword into the ground, causing cracks to spread out on the stage. This surprised everyone because Xiahou Yan had no intention of using his sword, making them wonder if Xiahou Yan was too arrogant. Then again, it would be a great humiliation for Lin Yun and the Sword Sect if Xiahou Yan managed to defeat Lin Yun without using his sword.

“Great Golden Sun Wheel!” Xiahou Yan clenched his fist and his astral energy, innate saint aura, and flame intent began to converge into a giant wheel of golden light that was nearly three hundred meters in diameter. When the wheel rotated, everyone could catch a charred smell in the surroundings.

Xiahou Yan had no intention of going easy and wanted to suppress Lin Yun right from the start. He didn’t plan on giving him any chance to catch his breath; he wanted him to feel despair till his death. He wanted the saints of the Sword Sect to regret it, and he wanted everyone to know that it was the Sword Sect’s loss for not taking him in.

As a dragon roar erupted from Lin Yun’s body, he clenched his fist with all the dragon runes rushing to his hand before he threw a punch out. When he threw his punch, the clouds shook as the purple-golden light collided with the golden flaming wheel, unleashing a terrifying shockwave.

When the shockwave swept out, Lin Yun disappeared and appeared behind Xiahou Yan, reaching out with his right hand, “Azure Dragon Grasp!”

As the sky turned dark with a thunderstorm raging, a gigantic dragon claw reached out from the thunderclouds and enveloped Xiahou Yan. This surprised Xiahou Yan because Lin Yun wasn’t using his sword, either.

This instantly made his face sink as he reached out. Flames then converged and formed a giant thirty-meter sword. When the dragon claw grabbed onto the giant flaming sword, the vortex at the center of the claw failed to devour that flaming sword. The giant sword and dragon claw then dissipated. This was the first time that Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Grasp had failed him.

There was something weird with Xiahou Yan’s attack, and it seemed like there was a reason why Xiahou Yan was known as the strongest swordsman amongst the younger generation when there were so many geniuses in the Ancient Barren Domain.

“You’re still too tender to fight me. I, Xiahou Yan, have never experienced a defeat since I made it on the Elysium Core Ranking, and it won’t be an exception today, either.” Xiahou Yan responded after he took Lin Yun’s attack head-on. They exchanged more than ten moves in just one breath before Xiahou Yan barked, “It’s your turn to take my palm now!”

A colossal flaming palm began forming above Lin Yun with saint runes at the center of it. This made the hand look like a bright sun, and its heat could destroy anything in the world. Before the palm fell, a series of explosions made it look like the palm held onto a sun.

“That’s the Great Sun Subduing Palm! This is a ghost spirit martial technique!”

“The Great Sun Saint Rune and Great Sun Intent? Is this guy a monster?” The faces of Ye Ziyun, Jiang Cheng, and others changed when they saw this scene.

“Did you think you can fight me? I don’t have to draw my sword to make you beg me for mercy! Today, I’ll show everyone that the Sword Sect is a joke!” Xiahou Yan arrogantly laughed.
