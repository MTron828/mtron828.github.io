Chapter 1104 - Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra

Every time Lin Yun recited a word, the ancient runes on the wall would shine brightly. When he was done, the ancient runes radiated with great brilliance. Simultaneously, the statue guarding the wall was completely dumbstruck as it looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.

Ever since the Sword Saint Mountain fell to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, no one had recited the verse in one go. In the past, it was impressive if a disciple could find a word in an hour. Even the talented ones could only find a word within half an hour at best.

But this was the first stage, so it wasn’t that difficult. Although it wasn’t difficult, no one had ever found two words, let alone the entire verse. Lin Yun accomplished something so unbelievable that the stone statue was having a hard time processing what just happened. In fact, it didn’t even know that there was an entire verse on the wall.

Looking at Lin Yun again, the stone statue was dumbfounded and said, “H-how did you manage to do it?”

Lin Yun blinked his eyes and smiled, “Didn’t I say that I’m a heaven-defying genius? Do you know what a genius is? Even the other geniuses aren’t qualified to lift my shoe for me.”

But the moment he finished speaking, he regretted his words. He was starting to sound like Lil’ Purple. He was even worried that she was poisoning his mind. But no matter what, he was easily able to see the entire verse with just one look. It wasn’t difficult at all. At the very least, it was a lot easier than cultivating the Sword of the Beginning.

Was this the power of the sky sword intent at complete mastery? Or rather, was his talent in sword dao a lot higher than the disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? When the stone statue heard that, there was nothing it could say. After all, the statue was the one who underestimated Lin Yun earlier.

“What should we do now?” Lin Yun scratched his head with an embarrassed smile.

According to the rules and regulations, Lin Yun had to challenge a word. But now that Lin Yun had recited the entire verse, it didn’t make any sense for him to challenge them all. So the stone statue hesitated briefly before it spoke out, “How about this, pick a word to challenge or you can also challenge the entire verse. Anyhow, you’ll pass the first test as long as you win, and I won’t stop you from carrying on.”

Looking at the wall once more, Lin Yun held onto his chin and fell into deep thoughts. He knew that he could receive a sword in the first test. It also seemed like the difference between challenging a word and an entire verse wasn’t that great.

Reciting the verse several times in his heart, Lin Yun decided on ‘cloud’ and pointed at it, “I’ll pick…”

“Wait!” But just when he was about to announce his choice, Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded out from the sword box.

“What’s wrong?” The stone statue asked, looking at Lin Yun.

“Hehe, just wait and see.” Lin Yun smiled before transmitting his voice to Lil’ Purple, “Hey, what’s the matter?”

“Relax. With me around, it won’t be difficult to make it through the 13 tests.” Lil’ Purple continued, “Furthermore, you must address me as ‘empress’, I’m the phoenix…”

“Out with it.” Lin Yun interrupted her. “Speak.”

“You see those patterns on the wall?”

“They’re sword marks. I saw them a while ago,” replied Lin Yun. The patterns were complicated, and he could tell that they were sword marks if he looked at it clearly. They even had ancient words hidden in the sword rays.

“Hehe, even a fool can tell that. You want to boast in front of me with your tiny knowledge? I need to educate you today or I’ll be embarrassed in the future if you go out. Continue to watch!” Lil’ Purple said with disdain.

Lin Yun’s face changed as he watched. It seemed like there was something to the sword marks, but he couldn’t understand it. It was just like what Lil’ Purple had said, there was more to the patterns on the wall.

“So? Did our little genius here manage to see anything?” Lil’ Purple asked with a smug face.

Her words made Lin Yun feel awkward because he couldn’t answer her. The wait also caused the stone statue to be confused as it watched Lin Yun. It was strange because it looked like Lin Yun was talking to someone, but he didn’t utter a single word. So the stone statue couldn’t help taking a few steps forward. “What’s wrong? I’ll give you a failing mark for the test if you don’t make a choice. Don’t think that you’re special just because you can recite the entire verse. As long as I don’t let you pass, there’s nothing you can do.”

“Haha, please wait. Please wait.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph! I’ll give you another half hour.” The stone statue raised his head and continued, “In my view, you’re just afraid. If you can’t make a choice in the next half hour, you can leave the mountain.”

Seeing the stone statue’s temper, Lin Yun quickly replied, “Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress, speak.”

“Hehe, you’re calling me empress now. But you have to recite my full title, the Divine Phoenix Clan’s…” Lil’ Purple mustered her courage and recited her entire title.

“Alright, alright. Stop,” interrupted Lin Yun. “The stone statue is already looking down on you, so do you really know anything about it?”

“Hmph, it’s just a puppet. How dare it be arrogant before this empress. Lin Yun, let me show you what’s in the verse you saw earlier.” Lil’ Purple snorted in disdain.

“There are clouds, sky, stars, sea, and wind. Don’t you think that the verse is more like a painting?” When Lil’ Purple said those words, a flash of inspiration exploded in Lin Yun’s mind. He finally caught what he previously missed.

Gathering his sword intent in his pupils, Lin Yun began to find traces of the painting. Not long later, the verse came to life and the words turned into a painting in front of his very eyes. In fact, the painting began to move and became even more vivid.

“Hey, statue. I’ve made my choice.” Lin Yun wore an excited smile and called out to the stone statue.

“So? Which word do you want?” The stone statue asked while memorizing how Lin Yun addressed it.

“None of them.” Lin Yun smiled, raising his brow.

“Are you messing with me? Get lost now!” The stone statue emitted a terrifying aura and walked towards Lin Yun. This shocked Lin Yun because he didn’t expect that the stone statue was actually in the Dragon Pulse Realm.

This made Lin Yun panic before he smiled, “Statue, why don’t you turn around and take a look?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“You think I’m a fool? Why should I listen to you?” The stone statue snorted but was suddenly surprised to notice some changes to the wall. Turning around, the stone statue looked at a figure walking out of the painting on the wall. This scene instantly made the stone statue fall to his knees, “Master!”

When the painting fully unfolded, the sword marks on the wall disappeared. They were instantly replaced with many fine patterns. Before Lin Yun could recover from shock, the figure from the painting charged towards him. But Lin Yun responded in time and summoned the Flower Burial Sword to block the attack. Facing this attack, Lin Yun was forced to take three steps back.

“Lin Yun, defeat him! The words on the wall are the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra!” Lil’ Purple became excited and waved her hand around in the process.

The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra? Lin Yun quickly looked at the wall. The words were flashing and he couldn’t see them clearly, but it really seemed to be the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra. Before he could look at it more, the figure charged towards him again with a sword.

“Good!” Lin Yun squinted his eyes and looked at the person before him. The person had a higher cultivation and was using a holy spirit sword technique, but his sword intent wasn’t in the sky sword intent. So this meant that it wouldn’t be difficult for Lin Yun to win.

Ten moves later, Lin Yun brought out his sky sword intent with a sun and moon radiating out of his sword. He cut the figure in two, forcing it to return to the painting. Then, the person pointed his finger at Lin Yun from the painting, unleashing a light beam that shot into Lin Yun’s mind. It was the Fleeting Cloud Thirteen Sword’s first sword.

Lin Yun merely closed his eyes and comprehended briefly before he opened his eyes. There was nothing difficult about the first test. At the same time, the person in the painting spoke out, “No wonder you can find the painting that I’ve hidden in the wall. It seems like you grasped the complete mastery of sky sword intent in the Heavenly Soul Realm. But it’s still incomplete.”

“You’re right, senior.” The reason why Lin Yun came here was to complete his sky sword intent.

“Master!” The stone statue continued to bow upon seeing the person in the painting.

The person in the painting looked at Lin Yun briefly before he pointed at Lin Yun, “Follow him. Don’t let anything happen to him on the mountain.”

“Roger!” The painting rolled up and disappeared back into the wall. At the same time, the stone statue stood up and looked at Lin Yun respectfully, “Greetings, master.”

Master? Lin Yun sheathed his sword and wore a smile. He was feeling pretty good about being called a master. “Stand to the side for now.”

Lin Yun wanted to remember the verse on the wall, so he instructed the stone statue to stand by the side while he sat and contemplated the verse. The verse flickered with profundity, but Lin Yun wasn’t trying to fully comprehend it. He simply wanted to remember it.

A short while later, Lin Yun slowly stood up. He successfully memorized the verse, but it was clearly incomplete. It was impossible for him to rely on this verse to cultivate the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra. It seemed like he needed to make it through the test to obtain the complete Fleeting Cloud Sword Stura.
