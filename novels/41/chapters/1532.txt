Chapter 1533 - Elysium Core Ranking

When he found An Liuyan, not only had An Liuyan recovered from all her injuries but she was also done refining the White Dragon Bone. She became even more charming than before, matched by her voluptuous figure and the natural charm she was born with. Even without using her charming tricks, she was already a bewitching demoness.

“You want to give the Elysium Core Ranking a try?” An Liuyan smiled after hearing what Lin Yun said. “That’s simple. You can go there yourself, but it’s more convenient if you have a connection.”

“That’s what I planned to do, as well.” Lin Yun didn’t want too many people to see him attempting the Elysium Core Ranking and wanted to use An Liuyan’s connections.

“Give me a moment.” An Liuyan smiled before returning to her room and returned in a man’s disguise. Her temperament had changed after disguising herself as a man. As a man, she looked elegant and handsome, which left Lin Yun stunned.

“What’s the matter?” An Liuyan asked.

“If you’re really a man, who knows how many women would be charmed by you.” Lin Yun replied honestly. He nodded at her and continued, “Something’s still lacking.”

When he was done, he retrieved a fan from his interspatial bracelet. It was the inheritance saint artifact of the Blood Moon Sect, the Profound Moon Fan. This saint artifact belonged to Ling Qianye. But after Lin Yun killed him, the engraving that Ling Qianye left in it was completely erased.

“Is this for me?”FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s pretty suitable for you.”

“I won’t be polite to you, then!” An Liuyan grabbed the Profound Moon Fan with joy on her face.

When they entered the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion’s main hall, their faces changed when they heard the discussions in the surroundings. The Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion was the most prominent chamber of commerce in Aquabarren City. There were all sorts of cultivators who came here for transactions. So Lin Yun and An Liuyan naturally heard information about the Radiant Sword Saint.

“I can’t believe that the Radiant Sword Saint is so strong that he charged into the Netherworld Hall with his clone and slayed three saints!”

“Didn’t everyone say that the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t have much lifespan left? He doesn’t look like he’s dying anytime soon!”

“In the end, the Netherworld Hall’s hall master had to make a move and personally destroyed that clone. But the hall master is cowardly, with no intentions of charging towards the Sword Sect to take revenge.”

“Why did the Radiant Sword Saint make a move on the Netherworld Hall?”

“No idea. But I heard that he did it for his newly accepted disciple.” This incident naturally caused a huge commotion within the Eastern Desolation. Everyone in the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion was talking about it. After all, it had been a hundred years since the Radiant Sword Saint made a move, not to mention the rise of Tian Xuanzi.

So there were a lot of rumors saying that the Radiant Sword Saint was old. But it didn’t seem like it because just his clone could slay saints. After all, who in the Ancient Barren Domain could accomplish that feat aside from the Radiant Sword Saint?

But Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that his master’s clone had been destroyed. He already expected it but still felt terrible when he heard it. He was worried for his master’s safety and even wanted to rush back to the Sword Sect to check and see if his master was alright.

Then again, he ultimately endured it because he had promised Lil' Purple the True Dragon Saint Liquid.

“Are you alright? Should we pick another day?” An Liuyan asked.

“It’s fine.” Lin Yun smiled.

The Elysium Core Ranking’s challenge was in the city manor, and the ranking covers the entire Eastern Desolation. Anyone who reaches the Elysium Core Realm could try the test regardless of age. So the ranking holds high weight, and there wasn’t any other ranking that could be compared to it.

An Liuyan interacted with the city lord a lot. So she immediately used her special treatment to bring Lin Yun into the testing hall. The one that received them was a grey-clothed old man. Looking at Lin Yun and An Liuyan, he asked, “Which one of you wishes to challenge the Elysium Core Ranking?”

“Me.” Lin Yun said.

The grey-clothed old man looked at Lin Yun and asked, “So, how do you plan to challenge? Do you want to reveal your name on the ranking?”

Most people would definitely choose to reveal their names. After all, this was an opportunity for them to make a name for themselves. But Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to remain anonymous because he was only here to prove his strength.

“Go in, then.” When Lin Yun entered the hall, he found himself in a spacious area, and the wall was engraved with golden names. Each name represented a cultivator on the Elysium Core Ranking. There were countless cultivators in the Eastern Desolation, calculated in the tens of millions.

Those who could make it on the ranking could be considered an expert within the Eastern Desolation, regardless of their age. If they were younger, then it would be even more incredible.

“Who comes?” A robust voice echoed within the palace, and a blue dragon appeared before Lin Yun.

“Blue Dragon?” Lin Yun was surprised. He naturally could tell that this dragon seemed to be a dragon spirit from one of the seven divine dragons.

“I’m the clone of the Blue Dragon Spirit controlling the three rankings. Tell me your name and origin.”

“Sword Sect’s Lin Yun.” After the dragon spirit heard Lin Yun’s name, words began to appear within the surroundings. They were Lin Yun’s origin. It recorded Lin Yun’s journey starting from the Heavenly Path. It was so much so that the fact that he had obtained the Azure Dragon’s inheritance was also recorded on it.

Lin Yun knew this dragon spirit was probably related to the Divine Dragon Empire. It was said that the rankings astral, divine, and dragon rankings were all established by the Divine Dragon Empire. So they recorded the information of every cultivator and came out with a proper ranking.

He heard that there was the Blue Dragon Ranking above the three rankings. The Blue Dragon Ranking was a divine artifact, and anyone with their names recorded on it would attract the attention of the Kunlun Realm’s Heavenly Will. Fortune was invincible, and this made it even more terrifying.

This divine artifact was under the control of the Divine Dragon Empire and was the foundation of the Divine Dragon Empire. It had been many years since it appeared, but it was said that the Blue Dragon Ranking had an artifact spirit of its own and would only appear at a certain time.

Lin Yun didn’t know much about it and was observing the Elysium Core Ranking to pick his opponent.

“Who do you want to challenge?” The dragon spirit urged after seeing Lin Yun staring at the ranking for a long time.

“Ranked 530, Zhang Tianyu!” Lin Yun said. Ling Qianye, whom he slayed, was ranked one-thousandth on the Elysium Core Ranking. He had defeated Ling Qianye before refining the Blue Dragon Bone, so Lin Yun was pretty confident about himself and picked an opponent who was ranked in the top five hundredths.

“Good!” The dragon spirit soon transformed into a youth of roughly forty years old. This youth was Zhang Tianyu, ranked 530 on the Elysium Core Ranking. His temperament had also changed, and this surprised Lin Yun.

“You’ve just reached the age of twenty, judging from your appearance, right?”

“Twenty-one.”

“Haha. You’re arrogant to dare to challenge me at the age of twenty-one.” Zhang Tianyu was practically his real person. He was arrogant and didn’t place anything in his eyes.

“Arrogant?” Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword and said, “You’ll know if I’m arrogant in a while.”

Zhang Tianyu sneered, “It’s a pity because I don’t want to know about that.”

As he waved his hand, a longsword appeared, and it was actually a myriad-rune saint artifact. This surprised Lin Yun as he wondered how he managed to do it, since this was simply unheard of.

As a powerful sword intent exploded from Zhang Tianyu, his Firmament Sword Intent began to fuse with his Lightning Intent, and a painting also unfolded behind him. Wielding the saint sword, Zhang Tianyu’s pupils radiated brightly.

When he thrust his sword, cracks began to appear in the hall. Zhang Tianyu had no intention of holding back and decided to defeat Lin Yun in one move. He was at the pinnacle of nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. Activating all nine stars simultaneously, his cultivation instantly multiplied ninefold.

In terms of cultivation alone, Lin Yun was naturally weaker since Zhang Tianyu was already in his forties. But he let out a roar and drew the Flower Burial Sword. When the two saint swords collided, it caused a rumble in the hall.

One exchange later, Lin Yun didn’t retreat, while Zhang Tianyu took ten steps back before stabilizing himself. Realizing that Zhang Tianyu didn’t seem as strong as he had imagined, Lin Yun was surprised because his eight stars weren’t inferior to Zhang Tianyu’s aura. When he circulated his innate saint aura, his cultivation immediately suppressed Zhang Tianyu.

“What’s going on?” Zhang Tianyu was surprised with his pupils squinted. “You practiced a high-grade ghost spirit cultivation technique?”

“That’s a secret.” Lin Yun smiled as he sheathed his sword. Now that he was confident about dealing with Zhang Tianyu, he no longer had to draw his sword.

“Are you looking down on me?” Zhang Tianyu flew into a rage as he charged over.

But Lin Yun activated the Divine Sunchasing Art, creating thousands of afterimages. Regardless of how furious Zhang Tianyu was, he couldn’t even touch the corner of Lin Yun’s clothes.

“My turn!” Fifty moves later, a cold light flashed within Lin Yun’s pupils and he reached out with his palm, executing the Azure Dragon Grasp. Empowered by the Blue Dragon Bone, a terrifying dragon aura immediately swept out, sending Zhang Tianyu flying before colliding against the wall.

When Lin Yun lowered his palm, the dragon claw slammed Zhang Tianyu to the ground, tearing Zhang Tianyu’s body apart. When Zhang Tianyu disappeared, the dragon spirit reappeared once more.

“Congratulations on your challenge. You can leave behind a droplet of blood essence if you don’t wish to continue your challenge, and your name will be on the Elysium Core Ranking when it refreshes, leaving behind a clone of yourself with similar strength.” The dragon spirit said.

“Then you’ll take on my appearance?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right.”

Lin Yun finally understood what happened when he fought Zhang Tianyu, but he had never seen anything like this. He asked, “Doesn’t that mean that the Divine Dragon Empire can use you to deal with me?”

“You belittle me. I have existed since the primordial times, and the Divine Dragon Empire wasn’t even around. Aside from one person, no one can give me orders. So you don’t have to worry about that.” The dragon spirit said, and its tone was indifferent.

“I wish to continue my challenge.” Lin Yun said after a brief pondering. This time, his gaze was on the top hundredths.
