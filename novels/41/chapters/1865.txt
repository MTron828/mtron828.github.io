Chapter 1866 - Curtain Falls

“Ye Guhan!” Hearing the name Tian Xuanzi mentioned, the five holy lands were surprised as they quickly turned to look at the white-clothed swordsman. When they looked at the white-clothed swordsman, shock covered their faces.

“The Azure River Sword Saint!” They blurted out, especially those from the Heavenly Dao Sect, who quickly cupped their hands together.

Ye Guhan was the eldest disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, and he was known as the Azure River Sword Saint after he achieved enlightenment in the Central Plains’ Azure River.

In reality, no one in the Eastern Desolation was familiar with the name Ye Guhan, and not many people had heard of him before. But if anyone mentioned the name Azure River Sword Saint, there was no one who hadn’t heard of him before. He wasn’t one of the Three Great Sword Saints in the Eastern Desolation but the youngest Sword Saint in the Eastern Desolation who gained enlightenment in the Azure River.

Aside from Tian Xuanzi, no one dared to call the Azure River Sword Saint by his name, just like how no one dared to call Tian Xuanzi by his name and addressed him as the Profound Sky Great Saint instead.

“We pay our greetings to Saint Elder!” The Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples bowed respectfully.

“We pay our greetings to Senior Azure River.” Those from the other holy lands were briefly stunned before they quickly bowed.

Ye Guhan smiled and left Lin Yun behind him for protection. “Tian Xuanzi, you’re really shameless to be disguising yourself as a woman. I didn’t know you had this kind of fetish.”

Despite everyone knowing that Tian Xuanzi had disguised himself as a woman, no one dared to mock him for it, especially after Tian Xuanzi injured the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Quasi-Saint. If that Quasi-Saint knew that the woman was Tian Xuanzi in disguise, he would not dare to act with arrogance.

But Ye Guhan didn’t have that reservation at all.

However, Tian Xuanzi wasn’t bothered by it, but differently said, “You want to bring him to the Heavenly Dao Sect?”

“Who knows?” Ye Guhan smiled. “I can also send him to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. But it’s not bad to send him to the Heavenly Dao Sect. Why don’t you guess where I’ll send him?”

Tian Xuanzi’s face was still pale as he coldly said, “Your stinking temper hasn’t changed at all, and I really want to tear your face apart.”

After Tian Xuanzi said that, he threw out a mouthful of blood, with his face becoming paler.

Seeing this, a cold light flashed across Ye Guhan’s pupils, and the thought of probing Tian Xuanzi’s injuries flashed in his mind. But because Lin Yun was beside him, he quickly gave up on that thought and smiled, “I’m surprised you dare to come out of your rat hole when you’ve yet to recover from your injuries. You can get lost now. I’m afraid I might be unable to hold myself back if you stay any longer.”

“It’s still possible for me to kill you.” Tian Xuanzi said without any change on his face.

As soon as he finished, Tian Xuanzi appeared before Ye Guhan. This stunned Ye Guhan, but he calmly sent Lin Yun away with a gentle shove before he began dodging Tian Xuanzi’s attacks. But he could only do his best to duck because he had lost the initiative.

Tian Xuanzi’s face remained indifferent as he slowly approached the scattered blooming purple flower. Ten moves later, the floral domain reappeared, and Tian Xuanzi’s aura climbed to an unimaginable height.

When Tian Xuanzi waved his hand, heaven shattered with a terrifying ravine appearing on the ocean. Tian Xuanzi took another step forth, and the waves in the ocean were immediately suppressed. Most importantly, he gave off a feeling that he was in a portrait fighting with Ye Guhan. It was as though he was isolated from the outside world.

“Great Profound Heaven!” Tian Xuanzi roared, and the saint aura within his body rumbled with a powerful aura sweeping out when he chopped down with his palm. This immediately left cracks in the surrounding space.

“You’re serious? I’ll play with you, then!” Ye Guhan smiled, raising his palm forth against Tian Xuanzi’s attack.

When he raised his palm, a black sword reaching ten thousand feet appeared behind him, “Divine Nether Sword!”

The seawater poured down from the sword like a waterfall as the black sword emitted a horrifying nether energy. Tian Xuanzi’s attack was greatly hindered when this sword appeared, and his movements slowed.

When the sword appeared, a black Netherflower appeared behind Ye Guhan with the Divine Nether Sword located at the center of the flower, emitting a black radiance. As countless black petals flew out, the petals clashed with the purple petals in mid-air.

Under the collision, Ye Guhan used his fingers as a sword to stop Tian Xuanzi’s chop. Thereafter, they both took several steps back, holding onto a petal each, one black and one purple. When the two petals flew out, the petals contained powerful saint auras that exploded in mid-air.

The explosion made everyone’s scalps go numb, and they could only retreat in terror, fearing that they might be implicated.

As Ye Guhan rose to the sky, he summoned a sword from beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven that flew towards Tian Xuanzi, piercing his body. When the sword pierced through Tian Xuanzi, the sword disappeared.

Hovering in mid-air, Tian Xuanzi smiled, “Ye Guhan, you made no improvements even after so many years. You have really surprised me, but how many attacks do you think I’ll need to kill you if I’m not injured?”

“Why don’t you come and try it? I’ll wait for you in the Heavenly Dao Sect.” Ye Guhan raised his brow.

Squinting his eyes, Tian Xuanzi said, “Don’t worry. I’ll come for sure. Not only the Heavenly Dao Sect but the six holy lands as well. One year from now, I will weigh the entire Eastern Desolation!”

He was decisive after experiencing Ye Guhan’s attack. He waved his hand, and a portrait suddenly appeared from both sides. As the portrait slowly closed up, Tian Xuanzi pulled Zhuge Qingyun into the painting.

Tian Xuanzi and Zhuge Qingyun disappeared when the portrait closed up as though they were never there to begin with. The pressure hovering above everyone’s heads disappeared just like that, and the rumbling ocean calmed down a long time later.

When everyone was sure that Tian Xuanzi had left, they breathed sighs of relief, especially the Quasi-Saint of the Divine Phoenix Mountain. They realized that it was no fluke that Tian Xuanzi was known to be the strongest genius in the past millennium.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“That fellow is becoming more and more unfathomable.” After Tian Xuanzi left, Ye Guhan didn’t feel relieved, but his face became graver instead.

“Junior Brother, are you alright?” When Ye Guhan turned to look at Lin Yun, a smile appeared on his face once more.

“I'm alright.” Lin Yun had yet to come to his senses. He did guess that the white-clothed man might be his senior brother, but he didn’t expect his senior brother to be so young. His senior brother seemed to be about the same age as Tian Xuanzi. Based on their conversation, anyone could tell that they were both from the same generation.

Because Ye Guhan was previously wrapped in white cloth, he thought that this was an old man. But it made sense when he thought about it again, since a Saint could maintain their youthful appearance as long as they were willing. It was just that no one would pay attention to their appearance after entering the Saint Realm.

Lin Yun was a little baffled and didn’t know where to start.

“I’m grateful for the Azure River Sword Saint’s help.” Mu Xueling came over after she settled Yue Weiwei down.

“It’s fine. We’re a family; you don’t have to be so polite.” Ye Guhan smiled. His tone was pretty casual, which naturally made Mu Xueling somewhat unhappy.

“Azure River Sword Saint, do you plan on returning to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain with me, or do you want me to bring him with me?” Mu Xueling asked.

Upon hearing that, Ye Guhan’s gaze changed a little, and he smiled, “There's no need to hurry. I still have some words to tell my junior brother, so I’ll send him to you when I’m done.”

As soon as he finished, he grabbed Lin Yun and soared to the sky, disappearing into the thirty-six layers of heaven. The Heavenly Dao Sect’s party still wanted to greet their Saint Elder and discuss the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, but they never expected that Ye Guhan would immediately leave with Lin Yun.

Looking at the direction Ye Guhan left in, everyone’s expression became awkward.

“Altar Master, don’t tell me that Saint Elder is really going to bring Lin Yun to the Heavenly Dao Sect?” Xiao Yuanqi asked, his tone filled with a hint of anticipation.

The Quasi-Saint, Jiang Yang, shook his head and said, “The Heavenly Dao Sect naturally won’t fear Tian Xuanzi, but Lin Yun possesses the Firmament Saint Cloth. Can you guarantee that no one will be tempted by it? Don’t test people’s hearts. This is the reason why Senior Azure River is probably going to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain.”

Xiao Yuanqi was disappointed when he heard that. If Lin Yun came to the Heavenly Dao Sect, the Heavenly Dao Sect would definitely be bustling. But it was a pity that he couldn’t see it.

Far away, An Liuyan let out a breath of relief. Beside her, Mei Zihua looked in the direction Ye Guhan left and muttered, “He’s actually Lin Yun’s senior disciple? It looks like the Radiant Sword Saint will have at least four Sword Saints as his disciples in the future.”

On the contrary, Gu Jun looked in the direction Tian Xuanzi left and muttered, “I’ll probably not be able to get my heart’s blood back. But who do you think took the Black Tortoise Saint Canon?”

An Liuyan and Mei Zihua were stunned when they heard that because they didn’t expect this matter today to blow up. Even Tian Xuanzi had shown himself, and many people had long forgotten about the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, not to mention Liu Chen’s death.

As for the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, they naturally forgot about it completely. When they saw Tian Xuanzi, they thought that the Black Tortoise Saint Canon must have fallen in his hands. But after they saw Ye Guhan, this made it suspenseful.
