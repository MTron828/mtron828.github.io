Chapter 2106: Sword God’s Smile (1)

After inflicting heavy injuries on Xiao Yi, the Bloodclothed Venerable retreated. Her speed was too fast, and she even looked like she didn’t make a move as the two afterimages overlapped.

“You dare stand out with your strength? Take a look at yourself in the mirror,” the Bloodclothed Venerable smiled.

Everyone from the Eastern Desolation was stumped while looking at the Bloodclothed Venerable with fear. Although Xiao Yi didn’t grasp a greater dao, he was a top-tiered expert at the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm and achieved many great feats. But someone like him was heavily injured in one move. Just how terrifying was the Bloodclothed Venerable?

Wang Yue and Chen Zhong breathed cold air, and everyone’s faces became ugly. After all, Zhao Tianyu had yet to make a move; only his subordinate made a move. Not to mention the Bloodclothed Venerable didn’t grasp a greater dao.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because the Bloodclothed Venerable felt too powerful. Her strength was comparable to Quasi-Saints at the Indigo Origin Phase, who grasped a greater dao. Something must be special about the Bloodfire Demon Flower beneath her feet, which Xiao Yi instantly fell for.

The Bloodclothed Venerable smiled, “Is this the best you can do? Is the Eastern Desolation filled with garbage like you? If that’s the case, I’m afraid the Eastern Desolation won’t even be able to take a blow when the Blue Dragon Record appears.”

“We’re at least better than the Blood Moon Sect, who had to hide for so long before daring to appear recently,” a cold voice said.

When Lin Yun turned his head over, he noticed the one who spoke was Bai Qingyu. She was really bold.

The Bloodclothed Venerable raised her head. She was briefly stunned before she smiled, “Times have changed. The divine cult will sweep through the Kunlun Realm, and we will spread our sacred flame in the upcoming Golden Era!”

“Divine cult? You guys are just a bunch of demonic cultivators.” Bai Qingyu glared at the Bloodclothed Venerable, looking like she wanted to fight the latter. Then again, she wasn’t weak and had awakened her Natal Yin Saint Physique, not to mention she also received guidance from Lil’ Purple back at the Myriad Graves Valley. So her strength had transformed. Most importantly, she had changed after experiencing life and death. She was no longer the ignorant little girl she once was.

In terms of potential, even Bai Yunfeng might not be comparable to her. But Bai Yunfeng held onto Bai Qingyu and shook his head, not wanting Bai Qingyu to stand out. Anyone could tell that the Blood Moon Sect came with aggression, and anyone who stood out would suffer. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Unless it was someone who had grasped a greater dao, it would be impossible for other Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints to face the Bloodclothed Venerable. But if a Quasi-Saint who grasped a greater dao made a move, he or she might be targeted by Zhao Tianyu and fall into a disadvantageous position.

Aside from that, the Blood Moon Sect even brought the other domains’ cultivators with them, and those cultivators were looking at the Golden Lotus Flametree with heated gazes. Those cultivators were more than willing to see the six holy lands suffer.

Lin Yun looked at the Bloodclothed Venerable, pondering if he should make a move to teach the Bloodclothed Venerable a lesson. He had fought the Bloodclothed Venerable before and was even more confident in dealing with the latter after his strength underwent a great transformation.

Right then, a voice resounded, “Bloodclothed Venerable, do you think there’s no one in the Eastern Desolation capable of dealing with you?”

Young Master Wushuang of the Divine Dao Pavilion stood out from the crowd. He came from a musical clan, and his talent far exceeded others in the same generation. He had already reached the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm.

He was enveloped in an indigo radiance that made him look extraordinary. The eyes of those from the six holy lands lit up when they saw him standing out. Young Master Wushuang was known as the light of the Eastern Desolation. Aside from being defeated by Ye Qingtian, his battle records were glorious.

Now that he had reached the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm, his strength must’ve undergone a great boost. Many people speculated that he could grasp a greater dao before the Blue Dragon Record arrived and stand at the peak of the Eastern Desolation.

“Young Master Wushuang is finally going to make a move! We now have someone to teach them a lesson!”

“If Young Master Wushuang can win this battle, he’ll surpass Ye Qingtian, and no one will doubt him anymore!”

“With Young Master Wushuang making a move, he can definitely teach the Bloodclothed Venerable a lesson!” At this moment, Young Master Wushuang represented the Divine Dao Pavilion and the entire Eastern Desolation.

Who said that there wasn't anyone in the Eastern Desolation? Young Master Wushuang was more than enough to intimidate the Blood Moon Sect.

“Not bad. At least you’re better than that garbage,” the Bloodclothed Venerable smiled, licking her lips. She was arrogant but had a meticulous heart, with no intentions of looking down on Young Master Wushuang.

Young Master Wushuang said, “Don’t think there’s no one in the Eastern Desolation. I’ll let you have three moves!”

“Hahaha! Good!” The Bloodclothed Venerable laughed. She wasn’t polite and squinted with crimson flames blazing within her pupils. As a crimson radiance enveloped the entire cave, even the Golden Lotus Flametree began to tremble. She was fast and turned into a crimson streak while charging at Young Master Wushuang, touching his chest.

Her speed made Young Master Wushuang’s face change, but he quickly twisted himself to dodge the incoming attack. He felt that his heart might be dug out if he was one step slower.

While his face drastically changed, Young Master Wushuang knew he had underestimated his enemy. Three moves later, Young Master Wushuang was in a terrible situation. Not only did he lose the initiative in the fight, but he also suffered several wounds on his body.

He knew that he had to make a move and retrieved a flute before raising it to his lips. Nine dragons soared to the sky behind him when he blew the flute. “Nine Soaring Dragons!”

As the nine dragons roared, they forced the crimson radiance to retreat, allowing Young Master Wushuang to catch his breath. At the same time, a powerful stream of saint aura poured out of Young Master Wushuang’s body. His radiance was golden. This was the cultivation technique of his clan, the Soaring Dragon Art.

With the Soaring Dragon Art empowering the nine dragons, the nine dragons instantly grew to over a hundred feet and gave off a terrifying dragon aura. The dragons were enveloped in an ancient aura, exuding a domineering pressure as they flew.

“Interesting…” The Bloodclothed Venerable looked excited as vines flew from her body, slamming against the dragons. As the two fought, a powerful saint aura swept out, forcing everyone to move while resisting the shockwave.
