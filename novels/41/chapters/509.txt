Chapter 510 - Divine Ability

The outcome was beyond everyone’s expectations. No one expected that Mo Feng would lose. He was in the pinnacle lesser Yin stage, not to mention that he was also the direct descendant of the Mo Clan. However, he actually couldn’t gain an advantage against Lin Yun.

After Lin Yun displayed his xiantian sword intent, everyone looked at him with shock. For Lin Yun to grasp the xiantian sword intent at such a young age represented his immense talent. An individual of his talent was rare, even in the Nether Prefectural City. However, the last thing that Lin Yun said was a little too arrogant. His courage to tell Mo Feng to get lost in front of Mo Ling was impressive.

Only Liu Yunyan was able to keep her composure. Lin Yun could defeat Han Fei and the rest when he was only in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm, not to mention that he had reached the Violet Palace Realm using the Indigoflame Goldlotus. Although Mo Feng wasn’t weak, the gap between him and Lin Yun was too great. Perhaps a monstrous genius from the Mo Clan could face Lin Yun, but definitely not an ordinary disciple like Mo Feng.

As for Lin Yun’s arrogance, Liu Yunyan had already experienced it before. Mo Feng was the first who humiliated Lin Yun, so it was natural for Lin Yun to retaliate now that he had defeated Mo Feng.

“This lad…” The few core elders standing beside Tang Yu were shocked. Lin Yun’s strength had widened their vision. Even with using the xiantian sword intent, Lin Yun had already grasped the rhythm of the battle. When he released his xiantian sword intent, the aura was suffocating. It was clear who the more appropriate choice to become the guest elder was.

“I admit my loss, but aren’t you a little too much? What do you mean by get lost? Do you think that the academy belongs to you?” said Mo Feng as he gnashed his teeth.

“Such arrogance at such a young age. I’ve experienced your temper and I’m filled with admiration.” Mo Ling raised her eyebrow as she glared at Lin Yun. In the next second, a terrifying aura swept out at Lin Yun. Mo Ling was unleashing an aura in the greater Yin stage that was mixed with spiritual runes.

The aura made Lin Yun frown his brows lightly as he was shocked by Mo Ling’s cultivation. Mo Ling could probably reach the pinnacle Yin stage any time soon. Furthermore, the aura coming from her spiritual runes even made him feel fearful.

“We’ll see!” Mo Ling took a deep glance at Lin Yun before she left.

“Cousin, are we going to let this matter rest?” asked Mo Feng with some reluctance.

“Shut it. Aren’t you tired of embarrassment?” Mo Ling turned around and left.

“Damn it!” Mo Feng cursed as he followed behind her.

“From today onwards, you’re a guest deacon of the academy. Your treatment is the same as an inner disciple. If you want to increase your treatment to that of a core disciple, then you’ll need to become a guest elder. Yunyan, arrange a residence for him on the Spiritwood Peak.” Tang Yu said as he threw a white tablet towards Lin Yun.

The white tablet had ‘Guest Deacon’ engraved on it with spiritual runes. It wasn’t something that could be replicated.

“Thank you, Senior Tang.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together as he watched Tang Yu leave. The other elders also took several glances at Lin Yun before leaving.

After everyone left, Liu Yunyan smiled awkwardly, “Lin Yun, you’re really bold. You’ve already offended Senior Sister Mo on your first day here.”

“You know my temper. I don’t provoke others if they don’t provoke me. Mo Feng started it. What, do you want me to smile at him?” smiled Lin Yun. He had nothing to say if Mo Feng was strong enough for mutual respect. But Mo Feng was just a piece of trash that couldn’t even take three of his attacks.

“Let’s go. Let’s talk while I lead you to your residence,” smiled Liu Yunyan.

“Senior Sister Mo Ling’s strength is ranked among the top five in the core disciples. Her attainments in spiritual runes are unparalleled. She’s the one teaching us spiritual runes usually and even some elders in the academy are inferior to her. But that’s not the most fearsome thing about her…” Liu Yunyan wore a grave expression with respect when she talked about Mo Ling.

“What is it?” asked Lin Yun.

Liu Yunyan responded, “Lin Yun, have you heard of divine abilities?”

“Divine abilities?” he questioned.

“So you don’t know about them? I bet there aren't many second grade spiritual jades in your sect, so it’s normal that you don’t know about it. Divine abilities are similar to martial techniques, but they’re used with spiritual runes. Plus, they’re a lot more powerful. Even the weakest Divine Ability can heavily injure a Yang stage expert in the hands of a lesser Yin stage cultivator.”

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that. Just what did that mean? The weakest Divine Ability can heavily injure a Yang stage expert in the hands of a lesser Yin stage cultivator? Lin Yun felt that it was a little impossible.

At the very least, he had to reach the greater Yang stage or the Thunderbolt Slash had to reach complete mastery before he could have a small glimpse of achieving that level of power. As for his cultivation, it was practically impossible. If he encountered a Yang stage expert, he could only run for his life.

“You’re saying that Senior Sister Mo Ling…” smiled Lin Yun awkwardly.

“That’s right. She’s someone that even a monstrous genius in the Yang stage wouldn’t dare to provoke,” smiled Liu Yunyan playfully as she waited for Lin Yun’s response.

“Wow. I just provoked a deity?” Lin Yun rubbed his nose and sighed, “Why didn’t you tell me about it beforehand? It looks like I’m in deep shit now.”

“Why? Didn’t you see how awe-inspiring you were?” teased Liu Yunyan. Lin Yun knew that she was teasing him, so he didn’t say much besides smile bitterly.

“But you don’t have to be too worried about it. Senior Sister might be angry with you today, but she won’t do anything to you. At most, she’ll just find you annoying and bully you a little,” comforted Liu Yunyan. She was naturally gloating at Lin Yun’s misfortune.

“Alright. Let’s put that aside for now. Why don’t you tell me more about divine abilities?” In the end, Lin Yun could only leave this matter aside. He was a casual person, so he wasn’t too bothered by it. On the other hand, he was more interested in the divine abilities Liu Yunyan spoke of.

“Divine abilities are separated into three categories- lesser, greater, and supreme. They originated from ancient times. At that time, there were tens of thousands of divine abilities. But a lot of them are lost now. The divine abilities in the hands of the various forces are few in numbers.”

Liu Yunyan paused briefly before she continued, “The Heavenly Province Academy is rather famous in the entire Ancient Souther Domain because we possess ten lesser divine abilities. Above the lesser divine abilities are the greater divine abilities. The greater divine abilities are rare, even in overlord forces. As for supreme divine abilities, they’re probably only in the hands of ancient sacred lands.”

Lin Yun was stunned when he heard Liu Yunyan’s explanation. Liu Yunyan smiled, “But my knowledge is only superficial. Senior Sister Mo should know more.”

“What? But you’re also a third grade spiritualist. Is the gap between you two so great?” Lin Yun was shocked by this news.

Liu Yunyan nodded her head gravely, “Yes. I can barely be considered a third grade spiritualist, grasping two to three third grade spiritual runes. Senior Sister Mo grasped over ten third grade spiritual runes. Otherwise, there’s no way she could cultivate the lesser divine ability.

“Cultivating a lesser divine ability is extremely tough. Many elders spent decades only to end up in failure. So you can imagine how terrifying the divine abilities are and the spiritualists who grasped them. Third grade spiritualists can barely be considered a spiritualist. Beneath the third grade cannot be called spiritualists.”

“Why?” Lin Yun was baffled by this explanation.

“You’ll understand if you can become a third grade spiritualist. But it’s not easy becoming a third grade spiritualist. So you’ll probably have to wait for a long time,” smiled Liu Yunyan mysteriously. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The third grade spiritualist is considered the entry level? Lin Yun fell into deep thought as he was filled with more expectations for the academy. In the past, his vision was too narrow in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. There weren’t any guides on how to cultivate spiritual runes.

But now, he knew why he couldn’t decipher the rose painting. He was still too tender in the field of spiritual runes. He was no different from a baby who had just learned how to speak.

“This is the Spiritwood Peak. This place is filled with spiritual energy, which makes it a rare treasured location. Ordinary inner disciples aren’t allowed in here. It is reserved only for guests and core disciples,” said Liu Yunyan as they approached a majestic peak covered in a misty spiritual energy.

“This is truly a good place.” Lin Yun took a deep breath and felt refreshed. Even his violet palace jolted slightly because the density of spiritual energy here was shocking.

“That’s for sure. Even the Mo Clan’s treasured land isn’t comparable to the Spiritwood Peak. Why do you think Mo Feng wanted to become a guest deacon? He was probably after this place, so cherish this place well,” said Liu Yunyan. Now that she had become a core disciple, she also had the qualifications to cultivate here in the future.
