Chapter 194 - Nine Stars Contest

Bai Ting had rage written on his face. He was the person-in-charge of the test. Furthermore, regardless of strength or seniority, he was the same as Luo Feng. So how could he endure Xin Yan behaving so rudely before him? He barked coldly, “What are you trying to do here. Are you trying to kill someone in front of me?”

“Xin Yan, calm down.” Xin Jue and Elder Luo Feng walked over to advise her.

If possible, Xin Yan really wanted to kill Wang Ning right now. But there was no way she could make her move in public. Pointing at Wang Ning, she said, “Speak, what did you do in the forest?”

Wang Ning started to panic due to his guilty conscience. Leng Mo, who was beside him, did not have any changes to his expression. He moved next to Wang Yan and explained what happened in the test.

Wang Yan’s face gradually brightened up before he laughed, “And here I was wondering what happened. It’s just a small scuffle between newcomers.”

“Small scuffle?” Xin Yan asked coldly.

“Is it not?” Wang Yan smiled. “The test method between newcomers is decided by Elder Bai. To begin with, the test encouraged a competitive spirit. It was unavoidable for the test to be brutal. As long as you don’t kill someone personally, you won’t be punished. Wang Ning, did you kill anyone personally in the forest?”

Seeing that the situation was in his favor, Wang Ning grew bold and laughed, “Big brother, how can I possibly kill someone? On the other hand, Lin Yun killed several seeded candidates and even wanted to take my life before a supervising elder.”

“Something like that happened?” Bai Ting raised his brow. “Wang Ning, are you certain something like this happened?”

“What I said is absolutely true, Elder Bai!” Wang Ning smiled and cupped his hands together. “I believe that the elder is still in the forest. You can ask him about it when he comes out. If my words are dishonest in any way, I’ll die a terrible death!”

Xin Yan nearly lost it. She initially wanted to seek justice for Lin Yun, but the tables were turned against her.

When the surrounding elders and disciples heard about the Sword Burial Woods, they couldn’t help inhaling a cold breath. Entering the Sword Burial Woods was equivalent to death. That place was marked as a forbidden ground in the Sword Firmament Pavilion and no one would enter recklessly.

Folding his arms together, Wang Yan smiled, “I have already said that this is a small scuffle. My younger brother did not take Lin Yun’s life with his own hands. Lin Yun was the one who ran into the Sword Burial Woods himself. Hahaha!”

Xin Yan was so angry that her face turned green. Who in their right mind would enter the Sword Burial Woods on their own will?

Wang Ning started laughing and added, “That’s right. My elder brother is right. Lin Yun has always been bold, so who knows if he was looking for opportunities in the Sword Burial Woods. But the simple fact is that I did not kill Lin Yun with my own hands, nor did I force him to enter the Sword Burial Woods.”

“You!” Xin Yan was so furious that she took a step forward and unleashed her murderous aura. It frightened Wang Ning and caused him to hide.

“What are you trying to do?!” Wang Yan became furious. “Don’t take it too far. Lin Yun killed four seeded candidates of mine and I’ve yet to settle this matter with you. I have already given you enough face, Xin Yan!”

“Not to mention that he has a garbage Martial Soul.” Leng Mo added, emphasizing the word ‘garbage.’ The pavilion was a place where interest matters. So if someone without any value died, no one would bat an eye.

“Wang Yan, watch your words.” Xin Jue raised his brow.

Seeing Xin Jue taking a step forward, a trace of fear flashed through Wang Yan’s eyes. He simmered down and replied, “I naturally know what I’m doing, given that someone else doesn’t take it too far.”

In the end, Xin Yan could only look at Elder Luo Feng helplessly. At this moment, Bai Ting spoke out, “I don’t want to be bothered by this matter. He’s just a newcomer with a garbage Martial Soul. Elder Luo Feng, you can handle this matter. I won’t interfere.”

Although he said that he wouldn’t interfere, he did emphasize the word ‘garbage.’ He was pushing Luo Feng into a dead-end. If Luo Feng still wanted to poke his nose into this matter, then he would be disregarding the pavilion’s interest. No one would help him fight with Bai Ting over someone with a garbage Martial Soul. Bai Ting wouldn’t be punished even if this matter was reported to the pavilion’s higher-ups.

“I understand, but Elder Bai, why are you so certain that he has a garbage Martial Soul?” Luo Feng smiled.

“Does he not? Why did he give up being a seeded candidate if he doesn’t have a garbage Martial Soul? Did anyone see him summon his Martial Soul in the forest?” Bai Ting smiled.

“Reporting back to Elder, he didn’t,” Wang Ning replied confidently.

“Elder Luo, what else do you want to say?” Bai Ting smiled.

“Nothing. Let’s go.” Luo Feng did not say any further. He left with Xin Yan and Xin Jue.

A woman wants to fight me? Wang Yan sneered inwardly.

After Elder Luo Feng left, Wang Yan turned to look at Wang Ning and smiled, “Well done. He got off lightly by going into the Sword Burial Woods after killing so many people of my Wang Clan.”

“Big Brother, it’s all thanks to your reputation. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to gather so many Profound Martial Realms,” Wang Ning chuckled.

“Do your best and try to recruit the ten newcomers.” Wang Yan paused briefly before he continued, “Go and rest. No one will be able to touch you with me around. The Nine Stars Contest will take place after this test. That’s the highlight of this event, so don’t embarrass me.”

“For sure!” Wang Ning and Leng Mo also looked forward to the Nine Stars Contest. It was a huge stage for them. If they could perform well, they could have their name spread throughout the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

Xin Yan still felt reluctant after returning. For some reason, she felt that she was responsible for Lin Yun. Lin Yun had already suffered badly during the examination, and now, he was forced to enter the Sword Burial Woods. She thought about it more and turned to look at Li Xiaotian. Her voice choked as she asked, “Why didn’t you guys help out if he was forced into desperate straits? Is the Wang Clan that terrifying? As long as you guys took the lead, others who are on neutral grounds would definitely help out.”

Li Xiaotian and the others felt guilty about it, so they did not dare to look at Xin Yan.

Patting her shoulder, Xin Jue smiled, “Go and rest. This matter has nothing to do with you guys.”

“Thank you, Senior Brother Xin Jue.” They all felt relieved and immediately ran off.

“Elder Luo, can you think of something and try to save Lin Yun?” Xin Yan turned to Elder Luo Feng and begged.

“I might be able to try if it was somewhere else, but it’s the Sword Burial Woods…” Elder Luo Feng replied helplessly. He sighed, “Even the Pavilion Master failed to bring someone back. That time, his face was black when he returned.”

Xin Yan and Xin Jue fell silent. There were three more days in the test. The foot of the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s mountain was lively and filled with newcomers. The pavilion would only recruit newcomers once a year, so this could be considered a major event.

So people would gather around if nothing else was important. At this moment, two teenagers stood side by side in a place covered in mist as a Dragon Blooded Horse followed behind them. Their temperament had undergone quite a considerable change, especially Lin Yun. His eyes were as bright as gems and a faint smile hung on his lips.

Now that he made a breakthrough into the Profound Martial Realm, he was like a butterfly that broke through its cocoon. The Profound Martial Realm wasn’t just about refining his origin energy. It was his evolution from a mortal. Only by unlocking his profound channel could he connect the seven orifices.

His senses would be sharper and his limbs would also be more flexible. Lin Yun underwent a greater transformation since he practiced the Thunderblitz Battle Physique. It made him look even more ethereal.

Li Wuyou was still shocked when he thought of how Lin Yun made his breakthrough. But the one who was more shocked was Lord Thirteen. Lin Yun had devoured a third of the Yin energy in the Sword Burial Woods. Lin Yun saw Lord Thirteen’s beard twitch from the lost amount.

Although they already exited the Firmament Realm, they still did not reach the Sword Firmament Pavilion. According to Lord Thirteen, there was only one exit to the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s headquarters. So Lord Thirteen could only send them back to the capital.

“Wuyou, it’s snowing.” Lin Yun stretched his hands out, catching onto a snowflake. The snow looked pure and white. “The snow in this capital is really gentle.”

Li Wuyou couldn’t help but sigh from his previous experience in the snow when he initially traveled to the capital.

“But the snow here is colder…” Lin Yun muttered and entered a grocery store together with Li Wuyou. After choosing something, Lin Yun specifically stated that he wanted a long spear.

With the spear in his hand, Lin Yun’s expression turned cold. When they came out of the grocery store, Li Wuyou nudged his lips, “Big Brother, look! It’s that baldy…”

Lin Yun raised his head and saw Windstream sitting down, raising his cup in their direction. He was instantly speechless. He was one of the titled nobles in the Heavenly Qin County. Li Wuyou never expected that his voice would be heard by Windstream, so he gave the latter an awkward smile.

“Let’s go to him,” said Lin Yun as went to sit next to Windstream.

“I never expected that I would see you here. What a coincidence.” Windstream was a famous figure, so it was odd that he would be drinking here.

“I’m waiting for someone,” explained Windstream. He examined Lin Yun and a trace of shock filled his face. They met two months ago and back then, Lin Yun was only in the fifth orifice of the Xiantian Realm. However, today Lin Yun was at the Profound Martial Realm.

“Boss, steam this carp.” Li Wuyou took out a fish from the basket behind him and handed it over to the owner.

When Windstream looked at the carp, his eyes lit up, “The Snowdragon Carp?”

“That’s right. But since you’re a monk, I believe that you won’t fight with us for the Snowdragon Carp, right?” Li Wuyou chuckled.

Windstream smiled and signaled for Lin Yun to look at his cup of wine. When Li Wuyou saw that, his face turned black. The Snowdragon Carp was something that he had gotten after risking his life.

“Windstream, this is some monkey wine that I’ve collected. Why don’t you give it a try?” Lin Yun took out a jar of wine from his interspatial ring.

“Great!” Windstream took it and gave it a sip before he smiled. Not long after, the cooked Snowdragon Carp was brought over. In the middle of the snow, the three of them sat by the street drinking monkey wine and eating Snowdragon Carp.

While the three of them were chatting, footsteps began to ring out in the streets. Eighteen people were carrying a jade palanquin. A thousand people were creating a path, while three thousand followed behind. It was a majestic formation.

Smacking his lips, Li Wuyou replied, “What a grand spectacle.”

Windstream had a trace of loneliness in his expression and replied, “That’s the Great Qin Empire’s Princess Flowerphoenix.”

Seeing his expression, Li Wuyou teased, “Don’t tell me that she was the one who shaved your hair?”

Windstream smiled, but didn’t answer. Lin Yun knew that Princess Flowerphoenix was the person Windstream was waiting for.

“Mister Windstream, the princess invites you to the palanquin,” said a maid who had come over.

Windstream immediately had joy written on his face. Nodding his head, he replied, “I’ll come over soon.”

“Don’t keep the princess waiting,” responded the maid before leaving.

Gulping down the wine, Windstream got up and wanted to leave. At this moment, Li Wuyou smiled, “Windstream, you’re a famous figure in the capital, one of the eight titles in the Heavenly Qin County. You drank the monkey wine and ate the Snowdragon Carp, but you want to leave like this?”

As he spoke, Li Wuyou was rubbing his thumb and index fingers together. Beside him, Lin Yun nearly spat out the wine in his mouth.

Even Windstream was briefly stunned. He had never encountered this situation before and replied, “You’re asking for something in exchange, right? Speak, what do you want?”

“My Big Brother knows a thing or two about the Dragon-Tiger Fist. Why don’t you let my Big Brother take a look at the genuine Dragon-Tiger Fist…”

When Lin Yun heard that, he immediately stood up. That was too big of a joke. Even Windstream was teased by those words and placed a jade strip on the table, “I can’t give you the genuine Dragon-Tiger Fist. However,I can let your big brother take a look at the Sky Breaking Seal.”

Looking at Windstream leaving, Lin Yun held onto the jade strip with the Sky Breaking Seal recorded in it. He felt that he was dreaming. This jade strip was precious and Lin Yun didn’t expect Windstream to give it to him.

Taking the jade strip, Lin Yun spoke out, “Let’s go.”

“Where are we going?” asked Li Wuyou. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion,” responded Lin Yun.

Li Wuyou’s eyes immediately lit up. “Wang Ning and those bastards nearly killed us in the Sword Burial Woods. It’s time for us to give them a surprise.”
