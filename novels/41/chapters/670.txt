Chapter 671 - I am who I am

Lin Yun had forced another person to their knees. Chen Xiong was defeated by a single sword. He was defeated even faster than Yang Pengfei was. At the very least, Yang Pengfei was defeated after Lin Yun took three steps forward and used a palm.

This caught everyone by surprise. After all, Chen Xiong was confident that he would win. However, his result was to kneel next to Yang Pengfei.

Everyone looked at Lin Yun in shock and their hearts trembled upon sensing the sword aura buzzing in the air. They had never seen such a powerful sword intent before.

“How terrifying. No wonder Chen Xiong was defeated with one attack. That’s the xiantian sword intent in complete mastery!”

“One could be proud if their xiantian sword intent was at greater mastery. But this person’s xiantian sword intent is actually at complete mastery!”

“Chen Xiong didn’t lose for no reason…” An uproar exploded out in Skymound City as they looked at Lin Yun in a new light.

Qin Ziluo, Jin Ling, and the other geniuses looked at Lin Yun with unsightly and grave expressions. Chen Xiong and Yang Pengfei kneeling on the ground was so mind blowing that it was equivalent to a slap to their faces.

When they recalled their earlier words, they realized their foolishness. Lin Yun didn’t know what was best for him? He didn’t know how immense the sky was? So what? Who could do anything to him?

The one who spoke up earlier were geniuses from the various forces. However, in front of Qing Ruoyou, they were like dogs as they tried to obtain her smile. Since they wanted to be dogs, they couldn’t blame Lin Yun.

The faces of Qin Ziluo, Jin Ling, and Gu Yunluo’s faces were ugly as they were placed in a difficult position. If they gave up pursuing this matter here, they would be humiliated. It was even worse because Qing Ruoyou was supporting them.

Looking at Lin Yun, they knew that he had no intention of letting Yang Pengfei and Chen Xiong off so easily. Regardless if it was for their prestige or dignity, they couldn’t retreat. As they exchanged a glance, they nodded their heads with a cold light flashing in their eyes. “Let’s go!”

Without warning, the three soared into the sky and pounced at Lin Yun. Clearly, they knew that it was impossible for them to defeat Lin Yun by themselves. So they could only gang up on Lin Yun to cleanse themselves of their humiliation.

Under the pressure from the three lesser Yin-Yang stages, cracks began to appear in the xiantian sword intent in the sky.

“Ganging up on me? Trash ganging up is ultimately still trash. Your cooperation won’t change a thing.” Lin Yun looked at the three indifferently as he circulated the overlord sword.

A domineering aura suddenly exploded out from Lin Yun and it felt like he was standing on a high mountain.

Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slash!

The sky began to turn dark with clouds and lightning tumbling through the sky. When Lin Yun swung his sword out, he unleashed a bolt of dazzling lightning empowered by xiantian sword intent at complete mastery. At this second, the surroundings had become pale in comparison to Lin Yun’s sword. With this attack, his sword was deeply engraved in everyone’s mind.

His sword was like a lightning bolt in that it was unbelievably fast. In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun had unleashed eighteen bolts of lightning. In the past, Lin Yun could barely use it once before exhausting his origin energy. Part of the reason was also because his physique wasn’t strong.

But he cultivated the Azure Dragon Enneaform, so he could unleash eighteen swords now. He could defeat an ordinary lesser Yin-Yang stage expert with a single sword, not to mention that he could unleash eighteen swords now.

Once the entire area was enveloped by Lin Yun’s domineering aura, the ground began to tremble and many cultivators could feel their internal organs turn.

Before Qin Ling, Qin Ziluo, and Gu Yunluo could get close to Lin Yun, they were hit by six swords each. Blood splattered everywhere as they yelled out.

In the next second, they were covered with sword wounds and fell to the ground. Their blood had dyed the white tiles on the floor red. Looking at this scene, everyone turned pale.

“Enough!” A rumbling roar echoed out along with a torrential killing aura as everyone could feel an immense pressure coming from this voice. Just how terrifying was this person to unleash such pressure with a simple roar?

When everyone turned to look at the source of the voice, they found Xiang Tianhe who was ranked forty-eight on the inner ranking. He was standing beside Qing Ruoyou with a dark face. Was he finally going to make a move? After all, no one here had hopes of suppressing Lin Yun aside from him.

This made everyone sign in relief. It was fortunate that Xiang Tianhe was here or the Skymound City would be thoroughly humiliated by Lin Yun today.

Xiang Tianhe reached out for a long spear as he spoke indifferently, “So brutal at such a young age. Even if Princess Ruoyou forbids me today, I still have to teach you a lesson!”

As Xiang Tianhe released a roar, a golden aura gathered on his spear.

When everyone sensed the aura, they sucked in a deep breath. Xiang Tianhe was truly worthy of being a genius on the inner ranking. From his spear alone, they could see how vast the difference in their strengths were.

Lin Yun wore a grave expression as he didn’t dare to be careless.

Dustlight Sword Art—Where Do The Flowers Bloom!

A torrential sword aura exploded out from Lin Yun’s sword as it clashed with Xiang Tianhe’s spear.

“He managed to block it?” Everyone was shocked by the fact that Lin Yun could withstand Xiang Tianhe’s sword.

Xiang Tianhe’s eyes flashed with ruthlessness before he stabbed his sword out once more.

Where do I come from! But Lin Yun chose to face Xiang Tianhe head-on and blocked his spear. This made Xiang Tianhe even more enraged as he brandished his spear once again to tear Lin Yun apart.

The endless mountain and lake; the crisping leaves and wind! Lin Yun brandished his sword calmly as he blocked all of Xiang Tianhe’s attacks. In the blink of an eye, the two parties had exchanged three attacks. The crowd was shocked to see that they were actually evenly matched.

“Die!” Three moves later, Xiang Tianhe spun the spear in his hand and swung it quickly, unleashing a rumble as it flew towards Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun faced Xiang Tianhe’s attack head-on with his sword empowered by xiantian sword intent, stabbing towards the center of Xiang Tianhe’s brows. The two of their attacks were ferocious as they pushed their movement techniques to the limit. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

When they passed by each other, Xiang Tianhe made use of his advantage in cultivation and threw his palm down.

As Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind, he faced Xiang Tianhe’s palm with the Great Wind Scripture.

When the two palms clashed together, it caused a huge explosion as the two landed on the ground a few hundred meters away from each other.

Lin Yun reached out to slap the ground in order to stabilize his figure. Wiping the blood off the corner of his lips, he smiled, “A genius in the inner ranking? Hmph, it’s not that impressive.”

Xiang Tianhe’s face changed as his aura surged violently within his body. Although he wasn’t injured, the clash didn’t exactly feel great for him. As he looked at Lin Yun, he questioned, “Who the hell are you!”

Not only Xiang Tianhe, but everyone present was also having doubts about Lin Yun’s origin.

As Lin Yun’s clothes and hair fluttered in the wind, he said, “I am me! I am Flower Burial from the Great Qin Empire’s Sword Firmament Pavilion, Lin Yun!”
