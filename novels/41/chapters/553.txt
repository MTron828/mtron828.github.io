Chapter 554 - As You've Said

When all the disciples saw Lin Yun, they were surprised. “It’s Lin Yun!”

“Why is he here? Is he here to laugh at us?”

“Since he’s here, he can at least win some face back for us. Otherwise, he’ll be letting the academy down.”

“That’s right. He’ll definitely be shamed if he loses despite refining the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower.” Discussions immediately rang out in the plaza. Lin Yun knew that he had no choice but to fight. Since this fight couldn’t be avoided, then he would fight!

The white-clothed youth’s eyes flashed with excitement when he sensed the surrounding discussion. He looked at Lin Yun and sneered, “Looks like you’re not a nobody in the academy. Good, I’m getting tired of beating trash.”

“The White Jade Academy sent someone like you over to probe us?” Lin Yun spoke calmly, but his tone was filled with disdain.

The white-clothed youth laughed, “As you’ve seen, I’m a nobody from the White Jade Academy. If you can’t even beat a nobody like me, then you’re nothing but a piece of trash.”

He had lowered himself on purpose because the humiliation would multiply if he won. He had enjoyed his numerous wins and humiliating his opponents. It was perfect because there was nothing the Heavenly Province Academy could do about it.

“Cut the crap. You can make your move any time,” said Lin Yun.

“Tsk, since you choose to stand by the side, then there’s nothing the Heavenly Province Academy can do but to be humiliated today.” The white-clothed youth looked confident as nine spiritual runes appeared around him. All of them were third grade spiritual runes that formed a dragon.

As the dragon roared, a thirty meter long metallic dragon appeared and pounced towards Lin Yun. The ferocity of the dragon had exceeded everyone’s expectation as it appeared before Lin Yun in the blink of an eye. It was evident that the dragon wanted to devour him.

“Nine third grade spiritual runes! Holy shit!”

“What powerful attainments in spiritual runes. Not only can he bring out the spiritual runes as he wishes, but he can even combine them.”

“He really hid his strength.” Everyone was shocked. The white-clothed youth was naturally a veteran third grade spiritualist or else he wouldn’t be able to control third grade spiritual runes so proficiently.

Lin Yun remained unmoved as his origin energy rippled within his body. Lin Yun gathered his origin energy into his finger as he flicked his finger. Then, an Iris Flower appeared on the back of his hand.

A boundless silver ray shot out and pierced the dragon. When the fluctuation landed on Lin Yun, Lin Yun was somewhat surprised because he was actually feeling some pain from the spiritual runes. After all, one must know that his body was tempered by the Dracophant Battle Physique.

If he had guessed correctly, the nine spiritual runes should be nine powerful penetrative metallic spiritual runes. This white-clothed youth’s attainments in spiritual runes was a lot stronger than Yang Xiong’s. No wonder he dared to act so arrogantly in the academy.

But the shock the white-clothed youth felt was even greater. His attack might seem casual, but he had poured his all into this attack. But even so, Lin Yun had easily destroyed his attack and the fluctuation from Lin Yun’s sword ray made him feel somewhat uncomfortable.

Since when was a guy like this in the Heavenly Province Academy… The white-clothed youth muttered inwardly as the nine third grade spiritual runes hovered around him and emitted a dazzling golden brilliance.

With a cold flash in his eyes, the nine spiritual runes suddenly bolted out like venomous pythons. There were only nine spiritual runes, but the pressure that they emitted was like an army. But even so, it was still too weak against Lin Yun.

After reaching the pinnacle Yin stage, Lin Yun’s cultivation had far exceeded the imagination of those in the same level. He could casually release an attack that even a lesser Yang stage cultivator had to be cautious of. After all, he didn’t refine the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower for nothing.

He only needed a punch to destroy this attack, but it would be meaningless if he did it that way. A smile rose on Lin Yun’s lips as he stretched out his hand and his soul mark appeared in his hand.

“That’s the Firefeather Rune!” The faces of many people changed when they recognized the rune Lin Yun brought out. Even spiritual runes of the same grade had differences. In terms of difficulty, the Firefeather Rune was in the top ten. However, if it was successfully created, its power would be unimaginable.

The Firefeather Rune suddenly expanded into a flaming pillar that enveloped Lin Yun. When the nine spiritual runes clashed with the flaming pillar, it instantly caused the ground to tremble. The flames had engulfed Lin Yun completely, but the flickering lightning that could be occasionally seen on the flames was shocking.

When the fluctuation faded away, Lin Yun appeared unharmed, despite some tears in his clothes. This shocked the white-clothed youth.

As for Lin Yun, he was excited because the Firefeather Rune was indeed extraordinary. This meant that he didn’t waste all that effort trying to condense it as his soul mark.

This fellow actually used the Firefeather Rune as his soul mark! The white-clothed youth cursed inwardly as he snorted, “So what if spiritual runes can’t do anything to you? Did you think that my cultivation is only for show? I can still make you kneel!”

The white-clothed youth began to unleash his cultivation in the pinnacle Yin stage. As he gathered all his origin energy into his palm, he threw his palm out towards Lin Yun.

“Success!” Many White Jade Academy’s disciples rejoiced when they saw this scene. They knew how domineering their senior brother’s Frostchill Palm was. The chilling aura was a poison that would kill its victim.

Even the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples exclaimed when they saw this scene. In fact, Mu Xue was also surprised. But the next scene left them shocked because Lin Yun still stood on the ground firmly and he didn’t seem injured. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

On the other hand, the white-clothed youth’s eyes nearly bulged out of his eyes as his mouth hung wide open. He was shocked to realize that he couldn’t sense his origin energy when he sent it into Lin Yun’s body.

The difference between their origin energy had exceeded his expectation. Lin Yun sneered as he barked, “My turn!”

The Iris Flower bloomed within his violet palace and filled every corner of his body with origin energy. When he clenched his fist, he punched the white-clothed youth’s chest.

The Profound Armor that the white-clothed youth wore broke. His ribs followed suit shortly after and he threw up a mouthful of blood before crashing far away. On the other hand, Lin Yun still stood firmly on the ground.

No one had imagined that the difference would be so great. Looking at the white-clothed youth getting back up on his feet, Lin Yun smiled, “No wonder you’re a nobody in the White Jade Academy. As you previously said, you’re just a piece of trash. You can't even take a punch from me. You’re even worse than a dog.”

“You!” The white-clothed youth’s face changed as his body began to tremble from humiliation.

When the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples heard that, they all cheered with smiles plastered on their faces. When Mu Xue saw this, she also revealed a rare smile on her lips, “What a grudgeful fellow.”
