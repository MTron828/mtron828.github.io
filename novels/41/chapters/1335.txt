Chapter 1336 - Running Out of Time

The internal structure of the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda was extremely complicated. After crossing the blood pool, Lin Yun could see many people flickering on those mountains, and fights would occasionally take place.

It was so much so that some Greater Elysium Core Realm experts even resorted to summoning their constellations. They had a terrifying strength, and the shockwaves from their attacks could even be felt from afar.

Lin Yun casually took several glances, but wasn’t too bothered by those mountains. He had no lack of secret artifacts or saint artifacts, and cultivation techniques weren’t too useful to him right now. He was only interested in saint elixirs and origin saint runes.

Qin Cang’s appearance had given him a huge pressure, and Lin Yun could feel that he didn’t have any odds of winning with his cultivation at the quasi-Elysium Core Realm. He could feel that even if he resorted to releasing his constellation, firmament sword intent, and even the azure sword holy spirit, he wouldn’t have much odds of winning.

Furthermore, the information he had on Qin Cang was too little because Qin Cang had only revealed his cultivation and the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art, at most. As a body-refining technique from the Dragon Clan, the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art, wasn’t inferior to his Azure Dragon Saint Art. But since Qin Cang had the Golden Dragon Bone, his body-refining technique was even stronger.

This was something that Lin Yun had to admit, even if he didn’t want to. The Azure Dragon Saint Art had a lot to do with why he was able to kill those who had a higher cultivation than him in the past, and it was also the key to why he could defeat Greater Elysium Core Realm experts when he was only at the quasi-Elysium Core Realm.

Three thousand purple-golden dragon runes, including the Blood Flame Divine Rune, allowed his physique to be comparable to a thousand-rune saint artifact, putting him at an invincible position right from the start. This was why he wasn’t afraid of his opponents, even if they had a higher cultivation. To kill him, his opponents might need to use a thousand punches, but he only needed ten punches to kill his opponent.

Being able to suppress his opponents with his powerful physique was satisfying. Then again, he had also paid a huge price for it. When he just started to temper his body, the pain wasn’t something that he could endure. He had exhausted an astronomical sum of resources, not to mention that he also needed a huge fortune to accomplish it.

The fact that Qin Cang could bring the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art to such a high level meant that the effort he put in wasn’t inferior to Lin Yun’s effort. After all, no experts in the world depended on luck to go that far.

Since his physique couldn’t be compared to Qin Cang, the situation had turned against him and placed him in a disadvantageous position. But Lin Yun still had the firmament sword intent, but this was his strongest trump card. If his firmament sword intent failed, then he would only be able to face death. After all, Qin Cang had only used the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art against him and not the Profound Sky Canon from the Profound Sky Sect.

“That’s weird. Even if I don’t have a dragon bone, I have the Blood Flame Divine Rune. So why can’t my Azure Dragon Saint Art suppress Qin Cang?” Lin Yun muttered to himself as he fell into deep thoughts. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Don’t bother trying to figure it out. This empress already said that the inheritance the Azure Dragon Lord left for you is all in the Azure Dragon True Bone. The Azure Dragon Saint Art is meant to assist you to refine that true bone to transform your body, allowing you to possess the Dragon Clan’s bloodline.” Lil’ Purple interrupted. “But since you gave it to me, you have no choice but to cultivate the Azure Dragon Saint Art as the main without the bone. Then again, the Azure Dragon Saint Art is also very powerful.”

The Azure Dragon Saint Art was naturally powerful, allowing Lin Yun to possess a physique comparable to a thousand-rune saint artifact.

“Is there really no other way?” Lin Yun asked.

“Nope. That bone contains all the essence of the Azure Dragon Clan’s Dragon King, and it’s even stronger than the Divine Golden Dragon. As for the Blood Flame Divine Rune, it’s merely a saint rune that’s later upgraded to a divine rune, not an origin divine rune. So don’t mix them up. It’s not weak since it’s a saint rune, but it’s impossible for you to suppress Qin Cang’s Golden Dragon Bone with it,” replied Lil’ Purple.

“Just suck it up for now in case you’re killed. After you reach the Elysium Core Realm, this empress will teach you the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. When you manage to manifest the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura, it’s not too late to kill him, then.” Lil’ Purple was confident in her tone because she could tell that Qin Cang had formed the Golden Dragon Aura. But she didn’t tell Lin Yun that right now because it would strike a bigger blow to his heart if he knew.

Lin Yun merely smiled when he heard that. Lil’ Purple didn’t know that he and Qin Cang were destined to have a battle on the Profound Wither Island, and this wasn’t something that he could avoid. Qin Cang wanted to defeat him to tell him that there was always someone stronger than him in the world, and Lin Yun also wanted to defeat Qin Cang to get rid of the demon in his heart.

If Qin Cang managed to step on him, it would strike a huge blow to his confidence and he would practically be crippled. As the strongest champion in the Heavenly Paths, his eyesight didn’t just stop at Qin Cang, he wanted to walk on a path of invincibility!

“Where did such a pure Golden Dragon Bone come from? Don’t tell me that there are really divine dragons in the world?” Lin Yun was curious about pure-blooded divine dragons and the Dragon Clan. The former was a divine beast while the latter was still human, it’s just that they possessed the bloodline of the Dragon Clan.

“Where the hell do you think? From their parents, of course. Where else do you think they come from? A rock?” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun unhappily.

When Lin Yun heard that, he could only let out an awkward smile because he forgot there was a phoenix with him.

“Speaking of which, where’s your main body?” Lin Yun began to examine Lil’ Purple. The Ancient Ice Phoenix wasn’t made up of ice and definitely had blood and flesh. If Lil’ Purple was able to find her main body, didn’t that mean that he would be able to get some Divine Phoenix Bone, Divine Phoenix Blood, and Divine Phoenix Feathers? There was no doubt that they were definitely stronger than Qin Cang’s Golden Dragon Bone.

“What are you thinking? Don’t you try to put any ideas on my main body!” Lil’ Purple glared at Lin Yun.

Having his thoughts seen though, Lin Yun wasn’t embarrassed and smiled, “Why don’t you tell me? No matter where you’re buried, I’ll get your main body back for you.”

But no matter how Lin Yun tried to ask, Lil’ Purple just wouldn’t tell him where her main body was. In the end, Lil’ Purple was annoyed and replied, “My main body is imprisoned in the Fiendgod Purgatory Pagoda. So give up on your ideas.”

Lin Yun was surprised when he heard that, but Lil’ Purple just wouldn’t say anything more, no matter how he asked. He was surprised that her main body was still around.

As the two continued to walk through the pagoda, Lin Yun began to feel disappointed. There were many treasures in the mountains, and those treasures were extremely rare. Even Dragon Pulse Realm would be excited upon seeing them. But they were too low-classed to the Quasi-Saint Origin, Serene Night, and the Dragon Saint Pellet he had previously obtained.

The saint elixirs and origin saint runes that he wanted to use to make a breakthrough to the Elysium Core Realm were nowhere to be found. Even if he couldn’t find them, even an ancient martial technique would work because his Golden Crow Nine Transformation was already lacking.

“You and your accursed crow mouth. Looks like the treasures were already taken by the Southern Emperor.” Lil’ Purple glared at Lin Yun. The 108 mountains were shining with treasures, but none of the treasures could catch their attention.

Each of the mountains were massive, and it would take half a month if they wanted to search all of the mountains. As for the Great Saint Origin, there was no clue about it on them. Since this place was enveloped in a celestial aura, everyone could feel that their cultivation was gradually increasing as they breathed, but the Great Saint Origin couldn’t be found anywhere.

“Is there any reaction from the Profound Wither Key?” Lil’ Purple furiously asked.

“None,” replied Lin Yun. The Profound Wither Key only showed a brief reaction when the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda appeared before it calmed down.

“The Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda only has one level?” Lin Yun asked after looking around. He didn’t feel that the Great Saint Origin would be on the first level.

“All of the layers of the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda are linked together. So even if it appears to be one level, it’s actually a boundless region,” replied Lil’ Purple.

When Lin Yun heard that, his brows locked together because he had no idea how much time it would take to find the Great Saint Origin with how massive this place was.

“Aren’t you the Supreme Heavenly Slaughtering Empress? Why don’t you just take this pagoda away?” Lin Yun joked.

“Get lost!” Lil’ Purple replied.

Just like that, the two of them walked around the mountains. They might seem to be strolling, but they were on guard for every single moment, looking around. But soon, they discovered something troublesome. The Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda was devouring people every single moment. As long as they were in the pagoda, they could feel that their vitality was gradually seeping away over time.

So if they stayed there long enough, even their foundation would be damaged. Even for someone like Lin Yun, who had a massive vitality, he could only last for two months, at most. As for the rest, they could only last for half a month before they had to leave or they would die in the pagoda.

“Looks like we have to quicken our pace.” Lin Yun looked at the Profound Wither Key in his hand with his eyes flickering. Right at this moment, a holy light shone from a mountain with brimming vitality and herbal fragrance.

“Saint elixir!” Lil’ Purple exclaimed with her eyes lit up.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun stowed the Profound Wither Key and headed over. Even if he couldn’t find the Great Saint Origin, he couldn’t return empty-handed. So he knew that time was running out if he wanted to reach the Elysium Core Realm before leaving the pagoda. Furthermore, if he couldn’t reach the Elysium Core Realm, it would be impossible for him to fight Qin Cang.

“Since when am I so concerned about Qin Cang?” Lin Yun muttered to himself in a somewhat frustrated tone. Even if he wasn’t willing to admit it, he had to admit that his battle with Qin Cang left a flaw in his dao heart.

Ever since he came to the Kunlun Realm, he had undergone countless battles, but he only suffered a loss in Qin Cang's hands. He wasn’t afraid of defeat, but this would mean that he would have a flaw in his heart as an invincible swordsman if he lost.

Half an hour later, he arrived on the mountain. The mountain was massive, and there were many regions covered in darkness. But the place where the saint elixir was born was dazzling with light and there were countless people heading over. They were all at the pinnacle of Lesser Elysium Core Realm, and there were even experts at the Greater Elysium Core Realm.

Looking at them, Lin Yun formed the Golden Crow Seal before a pair of golden wings unfolded behind him. After entering the Profound Wither Island, he had been using the pair of golden wings more often. This movement technique had a huge origin, but even now, he was still using the Heavenly Soul Realm part of it.

It was barely enough for him in the Empyrean Realm, but it would be a little lacking once he reached the Elysium Core Realm. But he had no solution to it because he would have to give up on all the foundation he had built up on the Divine Sunchasing Art if he chose to practice another movement technique.

So he could only hope that he could find the Elysium Core Realm part of the Divine Sunchasing Art. As a pair of golden wings unfolded behind him, Lin Yun’s speed increased and he quickly arrived where the saint elixir was born.
