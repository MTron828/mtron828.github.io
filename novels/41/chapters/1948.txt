Chapter 1949 - Golden Era

Ye Guhan’s sudden arrival turned the tables around, with the almighty Azure Solar Saint Lord receiving two slaps.

On the other hand, Ye Feifan was kneeling on the ground, filled with fear and puzzlement. He couldn’t figure out how Ye Qingtian and Ye Guhan were connected. After all, the Azure River Saint Sovereign was the chief disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, and he became a Saint Sovereign at a young age. He was an influential figure even within the entire Kunlun Realm.

In the eyes of the Ye Clan, Ye Guhan could practically become an Emperor and the pillar supporting the entire Ye Clan in the upcoming Golden Era.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun heaved a breath of relief when he saw Ye Guhan. Otherwise, he had no idea how to deal with this matter.

“Azure Solar Saint Lord!” Ye Guhan looked down at the Azure Solar Saint Lord with a smile.

“I’m here.” The Azure Solar Saint Lord struggled back on his feet and said in a trembling tone.

“Why did you move against Ye Qigntian for no reason? Is he not a fellow clansman?” Ye Guhan smiled with his eyes squinted.

“I… I’m merely following the ancestor’s instructions… the ancestor wants to see him…” Ye Guhan was clearly smiling, but this made the Azure Solar Saint Lord tremble in fear, and he didn’t hesitate to throw the Strong Peak Saint Sovereign under the bus.

“Even so, is there a need for you to be so crude? You’re a Saint Lord. Don’t you know that you might injure him if you’re not careful?” Ye Guhan said indifferently. “You’re pretty arrogant. Those beneath the Saint Realm are mere ants? So what if you’re a Saint Lord? Indigo Thunder Peak Master, go up and give him two slaps.”

“Azure River Saint Sovereign, you must be joking. Those beneath the Saint Realm are truly ants, and I will seek guidance from the Azure Solar Saint Lord when I reach the Saint Realm,” the Indigo Thunder Peak Master awkwardly said.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts, and he could see the rage of flames blazing within the Indigo Thunder Peak Master’s pupils.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master’s reply made the Azure Solar Saint Lord heave a breath of relief. It was fine that it was a Saint Sovereign slapping him, but it was a different story if it was a Quasi-Saint. Letting an insignificant figure in his eyes slap him was worse than killing him.

“Indigo Thunder Peak Master, I’m grateful for your tolerance, and I will pay you a visit with gifts. The Azure River Saint Sovereign is right; even a Saint Lord cannot bully others,” the Azure Solar Saint Lord said.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master was reluctant but didn’t dare to slap a Saint Lord with his cultivation at the Quasi-Saint Realm.

“Since the peak master isn’t willing, let me do it on his behalf, then.” A voice instantly attracted everyone’s attention, and the one who spoke was Ye Qingtian.

“You dare?!” The Azure Solar Saint Lord roared.

“Why don’t I dare?” Lin Yun stepped forth, bearing the saint aura that the Azure Solar Saint Lord gave off.

“Azure River Saint Sovereign?” The Azure Solar Saint Lord panicked and looked at the Azure River Saint Sovereign with a begging gaze.

Meanwhile, everyone in the surroundings, including Ye Feifan and the two Quasi-Saints, was dumbfounded.

Ye Guhan smiled, “If the Indigo Thunder Peak Master isn’t willing to forgive you, I initially planned to cripple a hundred years of your cultivation. But since Ye Qingtian has agreed to slap you, I’ll let you off for now. So why are you not thanking him?”

The Azure Solar Saint Lord immediately felt a chill down his spine, and his face became ugly because this was more humiliating than having a Quasi-Saint slapping him.

The reason why Lin Yun did this was simple. The Indigo Thunder Peak Master was good to him, and he wouldn’t let anyone harm the peak master, even if the other party was a Saint Lord.

When Lin Yun stepped forth, he didn’t hesitate and gave the Azure Solar Saint Lord two slaps on his face, instantly plunging the surroundings into silence. Even Bai Shuying couldn’t help taking a deep breath because Ye Qingtian was too bold.

Even if he had a Saint Sovereign backing him up, she didn’t know where Ye Qingtian got the confidence to slap a Saint Lord.

The Azure Solar Saint Lord’s face became ugly with disbelief within his pupils. Ye Qingtian actually slapped him.

“Azure Solar Saint Lord, why does the ancestor wish to meet Ye Qingtian?” Ye Guhan broke the silence.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The ancestor…” The Azure Solar Saint Lord’s face changed, and he said, “The ancestor wants to meet Ye Qingtian. He wants to know how Ye Qingtian made so much improvements in his sword technique, and he’s worried that he might be someone in disguise.”

“Since Ye Qingtian knows the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, isn’t it obvious why his sword technique would improve so much? Since he’s taught by me, you can tell the ancestor to look for me if he has any questions,” Ye Guhan smiled.

“U-Understood,” the Azure Solar Saint Lord said.

Ye Guhan sighed, “The Heavenly Dao Sect is still in one piece. The rules and regulations are still around and not meant to be violated, even if it’s between the Ye Clan. Don’t put the Ye Clan in trouble because of it. He’s now the disciple of the Dragon Origin Great Saint, and even the ancestor will be in trouble if the Dragon Origin Great Saint becomes furious.”

The Azure Solar Saint Lord didn’t dare to refute and quickly bowed before leaving with Ye Feifan and the two Quasi-Saints. With that, this incident came to an end.

“I apologize for what happened earlier. Please don’t hold it against the Ye Clan because of it.” Ye Guhan arrived before the Indigo Thunder Peak Master and cupped his hands together.

Ye Guhan’s action made the Indigo Thunder Peak Master feel warm in his heart, and he said, “Azure River Saint Sovereign, you’re too polite.”

“I’ll bring him away for a moment,” Ye Guhan smiled.

“Please go ahead,” the Indigo Thunder Peak Master said.

“Ye Qingtian, don’t forget your promise!” Bai Shuying yelled when she saw that Ye Guhan wanted to bring Lin Yun away.

In Ye Guhan’s residence, Ye Guhan smiled, “Not bad. Even the holy maiden is attracted to you.”

“Senior Brother, please don’t misunderstand. I promised her I would visit the Nether Orchid Courtyard in a few days because the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint wants to guide me in my sword technique,” Lin Yun explained.

“The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint? Did she see through your identity?” Ye Guhan rubbed his chin.

“I don’t think so,” Lin Yun said.

“She better not, or you’ll be in trouble,” Ye Guhan said in a playful tone.

“Is there a story behind this matter?” Lin Yun probed. He had a rough idea as it should be related to his master, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint.

“That’s a long history. But how did you become the disciple of the Dragon Origin Great Saint? Speaking of which, he was badly conned by our master back then, hahaha!” Ye Guhan couldn’t help laughing.

“I’m about to tell you about that…” Lin Yun shared his experience with the Dragon Origin Great Saint with Ye Guhan and his concerns. After all, he was the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, and it was a form of disrespect to his master to become the disciple of someone else.

“It doesn’t matter,” Ye Guhan smiled. “Perhaps our master has already predicted this. Otherwise, why would he send you to the Heavenly Dao Sect?”

Lin Yun heaved a breath of relief upon hearing that. After all, he had a good opinion of the Dragon Origin Great Saint. He asked, “Right. Senior Brother, why did this ancestor suddenly pay attention to me?”

“Probably because your existence has threatened the position of his descendants,” Ye Guhan sighed.

“He has a descendant called Ye Feng, and he has the strongest talent amongst the Ye Clan’s younger generation. He’s amongst the few who can compete with the Dao Yang Holy Son within the Heavenly Dao Sect…” Ye Guhan sighed.

Hearing that, Lin Yun laughed, “He really thinks too highly of me.”

Even without meeting the Dao Yang Holy Son, Lin Yun heard many stories about him. The Dao Yang Holy Son had reached the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage at the age of twenty, and he was an influential figure within the Eastern Desolation. He was commonly known as the Peerless Duo with the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s little princess.

He should be twenty-five this year, and there were rumors that he reached the Quasi-Saint Realm. Since Ye Feng could be compared to this holy son, this meant that Ye Feng wasn’t any weaker in comparison.

“It’s fine if you’re not Ye Qingtian. But if you meet the ancestor with your identity as Ye Qingtian, even the Dragon Origin Great Saint might not be able to save you,” Ye Guhan said.

“That terrifying?” Lin Yun’s expression became grave because this had far exceeded his expectations.

“That’s the case in big clans. After all, Ye Qingtian is the descendant of a concubine,” Ye Guhan sighed.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with surprise because his senior brother seemed to have some special feelings for Ye Qingtian.

“I’m also the descendant of a concubine and from a branch family. If our master didn’t take me in as a disciple…” Ye Guhan smiled, “So, I know how those people are.”

Lin Yun instantly understood the entire story. When he noticed Ye Guhan’s low spirits, he also changed the topic and told him about Wang Muyan.

“What?” Ye Guhan was surprised. He didn’t expect that it was Wang Muyan who instructed Ye Qingtian to sneak into the Celestial Pool. He said with a grave expression, “Don’t recklessly make a move. The Wang Clan greatly influences the Heavenly Dao Sect, and you’ll be in trouble if you’re careless.”

When he was done, he sighed, “The Blue Dragon Record will be appearing soon, and no one can avoid it.”

He was a Saint Sovereign, so he could see through many things and even participate in some events. This was why he understood more about the upcoming Golden Era than Lin Yun.

“Is the Blue Dragon Record that important?” Lin Yun asked, as he had heard about it multiple times. He couldn’t figure out how a book could cause such a huge commotion.

“The Blue Dragon Record is naturally important…” Ye Guhan sighed. “Most importantly, the Kunlun Realm will be thrown into chaos when it appears, and no one can avoid it, not even you.

“From a certain degree, even our master is dragged into this matter. What better way to end an era than with the death of an Emperor? What is more suitable than using an Emperor’s blood to unfold a new era? I believe that the Empress has been waiting for this moment for a long time.” Ye Guhan squinted his pupils, with the corner of his lips rising into mockery. His eyes were flashing with chill and killing intent.

Lin Yun instantly remembered that his senior brother had previously left and said it was related to their master. Now, it looks like whatever his senior brother went to do wasn’t successful.

But just when he wanted to ask something else, Ye Guhan smiled, “Since you’ve reached the Astral Sword intent, it’s time for me to teach you how to cultivate your Sword Heart.”
