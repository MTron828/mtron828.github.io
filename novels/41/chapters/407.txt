Chapter 408 - The Violet Palace Realm Acts

When the painting exploded on the streets, the Divine Guards flew out along with the shattered rocks and snow. The sudden explosion sent the Divine Guards into chaos and many people were hit by the impact.

But Han Tianming’s death had surpassed everyone’s expectations. No one had imagined that a quasi-Violet Palace Realm had died such a horrible death under Lin Yun’s attack.

This outcome was unexpected, even for Han Tianming himself. He was still toying with Lin Yun right before he died.

Lin Yun soared into the sky as he dashed towards Xin Yan disregarding the pain from the rocks hitting his face.

Qin Yu sat calmly on the carriage as he looked at Lin Yun, who was approaching with a calm look on his face. It was as if Lin Yun was invisible. No one knew what was going through his mind. But just when Lin Yun was about to get close to the carriage, three sword rays appeared that interlocked and formed into a net in front of Qin Yu and Xin Yan.

The sword rays came from the Demonic Moon Villa’s Wang Feng, Primal Origin Sect’s Ji Wuheng, and the Heavenly Qin Institute’s Tang Jie. They were all core disciples of their various sects, but they were also members of the Azure Association.

The three of them were in the tenth stage and they had circulated all their power into this move. They clearly wanted to aim for Lin Yun’s vital spots and take advantage of the fact that Lin Yun was only in the eighth stage of the Profound Martial Realm.

The three were from different sects, so there was no way that their rapport could compare to the elites of the Divine Guards. However, they were still core disciples of their own sects and they were in the second sequence in the empire. So their attacks were naturally more terrifying than the elites of the Divine Guards.

Seeing the three attacks overlapped each other, Lin Yun hesitated as he contemplated retreat. There was no way he could use the painting again, so he would lose his chance the moment the Divine Guards recover.

But if he didn’t retreat, he would be killed if he was careless. After all, the three core disciples wouldn’t go easy on him.

In the end, Lin Yun decided not to retreat. Lin Yun pushed the quasi-xiantian sword intent to the limit and the Flower Burial Sword in his hand began to buzz. The Iris Flower in his dantian blossomed and a violet aura exploded from within his body.

His quasi-xiantian sword intent overlapped with the Flower Burial Sword and clashed with the three sword rays. The collision created a dazzling radiance that made everyone feel stinging pain in their eyes. At the same time, the shockwave from their clash fluctuated.

This caused many of the spectators to lose control of their swords as their swords flew out.

“My sword!”

“This...this is too powerful. I’ve never seen such a powerful sword intent!”

“How terrifying! Lin Yun actually managed to withstand the attack. The swordsmen from the three major forces actually failed to suppress him!” The terrifying aura shocked the crowd who was standing in the streets.

Wang Feng, Ji Wuheng, and Tang Jie’s faces were all ugly. They never imagined that they would embarrass themselves in front of the crown prince. They actually failed to suppress Lin Yun and were suppressed instead.

With a huge explosion, both parties separated and their sword rays turned into a violet storm that swept through the surroundings. Ji Wuheng, Wang Feng, and Tang Jie’s faces were dark. They exchanged a glance and their eyes flashed with killing aura.

“Rising Smokecloud!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Crossing River!”

“Soaring Sword!” They each threw out their strongest attacks at Lin Yun.

“Good timing!” Lin Yun’s clothes were covered in blood, but he didn’t panic when he saw the attacks coming at him. After reaching the manifestation stage, the Aquaselenic Sword had reached a terrifying height.

When Lin Yun pushed the Aquaselenic Sword to the limit, Lin Yun’s figure suddenly exploded and divided into nine afterimages.

“What’s going on?” Wang Feng, Ji Wuheng, and Tang Jie’s faces changed. They had clearly locked onto Lin Yun, so why did they lose Lin Yun all of a sudden? Looking at the nine afterimages, they couldn’t verify which was the real Lin Yun.

“Moon Reflection!” When the nine afterimages overlapped in the sky, a bright moon appeared on Lin Yun. When he swung his sword out, he was like a celestial who came out of a painting to overlap with the moonlight.

This caught Wang Feng, Ji Wuheng, and Tang Jie by surprise as their attacks were shattered. The three of them threw up a mouthful of blood as they fell from the sky. At the same time, their sword aura shattered like a piece of paper and they slowly faded in the blizzard.

“Holy shit!”

“What sword technique is that?”

“What the hell did I just witness?” An uproar rang from the surroundings. If Lin Yun had only revealed the tip of his sword technique, then the Moon Reflection would have been his strongest attack. Not to mention that Lin Yun had become a cripple three months ago.

But three months later, when Lin Yun made his return, he was so dazzling that no one could look at him directly. After Lin Yun heavily injured the three core disciples, he continued his journey towards Xin Yan.

“That’s enough…” Qin Yu finally spoke out at this moment. When he spoke, a terrifying aura exploded from the rear of the carriage that placed everyone under a great pressure. At that moment, many people’s legs trembled as they struggled to remain standing.

“An expert in the Violet Palace Realm!” Everyone’s faces changed.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw a palm descending that instantly sent him flying away. As he fell onto the ground, he threw up a mouthful of blood.

“Your Highness, I have already verified that he’s here alone and there aren’t any Violet Palace Realm experts with him. Although there are many Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples mixed within the crowd, there isn’t a single elder in the Violet Palace Realm, not to mention any Sword-Bearing Elders.” A voice sounded beside Qin Yu that left him shocked.

The reason why he refrained from killing Lin Yun was because he didn’t believe that Lin Yun was here alone. He was confident that someone came along to protect Lin Yun. After all, no one dared to go against him so openly.

He didn’t believe that Lin Yun was here to court death and that something must have given Lin Yun the confidence to stop his carriage. He never expected that Lin Yun was really here alone. Was he trying to become a lonely hero? Since that was the case, Qin Yu wouldn’t hesitate any longer.

A cold light flashed in his eyes, and he nodded his head. The Violet Palace Realm expert who sent Lin Yun back earlier reappeared once more and threw a palm out at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun managed to withstand the palm from earlier because of the Moon Reflection, but Lin Yun wouldn’t have the chance to execute his martial technique this time. To the Violet Palace Real expert, everyone beneath him was an ant and the difference between his power and Lin Yun’s was too great.

At the same time, a huge punch flew over like a dragon and tiger that clashed with the palm. A man wearing a white mask appeared in the sky and stopped the attacker.

The Violet Palace Realm old man’s eyes flashed coldly and he looked at the newcomer, “Stop hiding behind the mask. Do you dare to show your face?”

“You don’t need to worry about my identity. However, you’ll have to get through me if you want to kill Lin Yun,” declared the mysterious man.

At the same time, a question appeared in everyone’s mind. Who is this person to actually dare to interfere in the crown prince’s affair?

Judging from his movement technique and fist technique, he didn’t seem to belong to the Sword Firmament Pavilion. At the same time, the crown prince was puzzled. Didn’t the old man say that there was no one from the Sword Firmament Pavilion present?

“Lin Yun will die today and no one can save him. You’re not an exception!” The old man said in a domineering tone. He then walked towards Lin Yun, leaving footprints in the snow with every step he took.

After seven steps, the old man’s aura had suppressed the entire blizzard. He was like heaven itself, which brought great pressure to everyone.

“Take another step if you have the guts,” said the mysterious man as he landed beside Lin Yun. His footsteps didn’t leave any footprints in the snow and his aura made the old man frown his brows.

The old man’s aura became even more eerie, but he didn’t take another step forth. He was looking at the masked figure and wondering who this person was to actually dare to face a Violet Palace Realm expert!
