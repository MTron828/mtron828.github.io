Chapter 2327 - Image of the Sovereign Monument

Lin Yun soon arrived beside Ji Zixi and finally knew what was happening after looking in the direction she pointed out. Three people from the Blood Bone Gate were ganging up on one person ahead of them. The person being ganged up on had an extraordinary sword technique, and his Heavenly King Sword was powerful.

The Heavenly King Sword was powerful enough to protect himself in this region. This person was the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s Wu Yuhua!

But it was a pity that his opponents were also powerful. They were Saints from the Blood Bone Gate and were sixth-stage Saint Lords. Their bodies were enveloped in saint energy, perfectly fusing their baleful aura with saint dao.

Each punch was terrifying and sounded like the roar of an ominous beast, and the three held the advantage since they were ganging up on a person.

“The Blood Bone Gate and Heavenly Sword Pavilion? Haha, they’re mortal enemies in the Azure Cloud Realm. Without Lin Jiangxian, it looks like that fellow’s situation doesn’t look good,” Xiong Tiannan smiled. He had no reservations in his comment after knowing Lin Yun didn’t belong to the Heavenly Sword Pavilion.

“They’re all sixth-stage Saint Lords…” Lin Yun frowned, looking at the three ganging up on Wu Yuhua. It looks like the foundation of the demonic sect in the Azure Cloud Realm was a little terrifying.

Xiong Tiannan smiled, “Sixth-stage Saint Lords are still fine. The last three stages are the toughest, and each breakthrough is the same as being strengthened ten times. But you will also face the corresponding tribulations. A seventh-stage Saint Lord would face Windfire Tribulation that has killed countless geniuses. So many cultivators don’t dare to make a breakthrough.”

Lin Yun’s face changed since he knew about it. But in the Kunlun Realm, all the stages were tough, including the last three stages. Since the Heavenly Path was severed, cultivating wasn’t friendly to Saints.

“What about you? How did you go on the Brandished Dragon Ranking when you’re only at the sixth-stage Saint Lord?” Ji Zixi asked.

“I became a saint through my physique, so how can I be compared to those ordinary sixth-stage Saint Lords?” Xiong Tiannan replied.

Lin Yun looked towards the ongoing battle but wasn’t in a hurry to help. He noticed that Wu Yuhua had improved his Heavenly King Sword after hearing his words, shifting from borrowing the power of the heavens to breaking the heavens with his power. This allowed his Heavenly King Sword to be different from before.

Although the three Blood Bone Gate’s cultivators were ganging up on him, they couldn’t take him down. The dire straits allowed Wu Yuhua to push himself to the limit with a purple aura gathering around him with his sword ray, giving off a feeling that it could suppress everything in the world.

But under the prolonged battle, he gradually lost his advantage and was sent flying away, throwing out a mouthful of blood.

“Finish him off!”

“The Heavenly Sword Pavilion should have been removed from the Azure Cloud Realm long ago. You guys still want to rely on the Heavenly Barren Realm to change your fate?” The three demonic cultivators released a torrential demonic aura, planning to kill Wu Yuhua.

But in the nick of time, three beams shot over, piercing through the chests of the three demonic cultivators as they threw out blood with their faces becoming pale. But they were Saints and wouldn’t die even with their hearts destroyed. This made them furious, and wanted to sever these ribbons. Hundreds to thousands of ribbons then flew over before they could even bring out their golden pills.

The three demonic cultivators were riddled with holes and could not defend themselves. Shortly after, a thunderous explosion resounded with the surroundings trembling.

Lin Yun waved his hand on a distant mountain and pulled the three corpses over, tearing their constellations apart. This scene was too shocking, causing Xiong Tiannan’s lips to twitch and his face pale.

Lin Yun was so strong and yet he asked him why he didn’t make a move. Would he even dare to make a move? Xiong Tiannan knew that he had a lot of advantages since he became a saint through his physique. Those ribbons might not be able to pierce through his body, but it shouldn’t be difficult for those ribbons to destroy his saint energy. So he naturally wouldn’t be stupid to face those ribbons with his physique.

At such close distance, he noticed something. The ribbons were all inscribed with divine runes and radiated with powerful sword intent. The ribbons should have been produced by an ancient martial technique but had been refined by Lin Yun to become comparable to Glory Saint Artifacts.

“Brother Lin, I won’t accompany you to the Sovereign Monument, and will take my leave first,” Xiong Tiannan smiled. He continued, “Thanks for the golden fortune, and I will prepare the mystery boxes I promised.”

When Lin Yun recalled the ribbons, he was baffled as he looked at the leaving Xiong Tiannan.

“He was frightened by you,” Ji Zixi smiled.

Lin Yun recollected his gaze, and said, “There’s no need to care about him. Let’s go take a look at Brother Wu.”

After a few breaths, Lin Yun and Ji Zixi reached the still-shaken Wu Yuhua. When Wu Yuhua saw Lin Yun, he asked, "Lin Brother, did you see who saved me?"

Lin Yun smiled and replied, "I didn’t."

“Is it him?” Wu Yuhua could faintly see Xiong Tiannan’s figure and became doubtful.

Lin Yun merely smiled and said nothing.

“He’s strong and must be on the Brandished Dragon Ranking. His back figure is familiar,” Wu Yuhua said. What he said wasn’t fake because Xiong Tiannan was indeed someone on the Brandished Dragon Ranking, but he couldn’t easily deal with those three demonic cultivators with his strength.

Ji Zixi was inwardly laughing because Xiong Tiannan left because he was frightened by Lin Yun. But it was troublesome to explain, and Wu Yuhua would never expect Lin Yun to be so strong.

“Speaking of which, weren’t you guys together? Why did you split up?” Lin Yun asked, changing the topic.

After mentioning that, Wu Yuhua bitterly smiled, “We were together in the beginning, but we soon realized that the treasures weren’t enough to share and gradually split up.”

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by that. It was fine if Lin Jiangxian led the party because no one would dare to question her, but she couldn’t bring too many people with her.

Right then, a few sword rays flew over. Seeing this, Wu Yuhua said, “The chief must be here. I used the rescue signal earlier.”

It wasn’t long before Lin Jiangxian descended with disciples of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion. When they asked about the situation, Wu Yuhua explained, “I ran into people from the Blood Bone Gate, but I was fortunate that someone helped me. His back figure looked like Xiong Tiannan, but I can’t be sure about his identity since it was too far away.”

“Xiong Tiannan? That fellow doesn’t care if you’re from the righteous or demonic path when he starts to kill.” Lin Jiangxian was baffled and turned to look at Lin Yun.

“What’s difficult about it? He must be afraid to make a move since he’s afraid of our chief,” Chang Jun smiled.

Wu Yuhua couldn’t figure it out, and Lin Jiangxian didn’t dwell on it, either. She turned to Lin Yun and asked, “Are the two of you doing well?”

“Thanks for your concern, but we’re doing well,” Lin Yun smiled.

“I bet you have a huge harvest. I wonder how many saint fruits you've obtained?” Chang Jun smiled.

Lin Yun said nothing, but Xi Ruo said, “Senior Brother Chang obtained ten saint fruits and three indigo fortunes.”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The two were unhappy with Lin Jiangxian’s attitude towards Lin Yun, so they boasted about their harvest.

But Lin Yun merely inwardly laughed because he had given away a golden fortune. But these two wanted to show off with indigo fortune?

“Why aren’t you guys talking?” Xi Ruo asked, looking at Ji Zixi.

“Stop embarrassing yourselves,” Lin Jiangxian coldly looked at the two. She didn’t know about Lin Yun’s harvest, but Lin Yun’s saint dao was more refined. Just this alone was enough to say that his harvest was plentiful.

“It’s nothing,” Lin Yun smiled.

“I’m pretty accurate when looking at someone. Based on your talent, you’re only lacking in foundation. If you’re interested, you can visit the Heavenly Sword Pavilion after the Heavenly Barren Realm. I can vouch for you,” Lin Jiangxian said.

Upon hearing that, Chang Jun and Xi Ruo’s faces changed. With Lin Jiangxian as the voucher, it was practically sure that Lin Yun could enter the headquarters of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion. They began to examine Lin Yun with doubt, trying to figure out why he could receive a vouch from Lin Jiangxian.

Lin Yun didn’t accept the offer and smiled, “You’re flattering me.”

“I can tell with a glance that you’re a genuine swordsman, and your talent isn’t any lower than mine,” Lin Jiangxian said certainly.

Lin Yun merely smiled but said nothing.

“There’s no need to hurry. You can consider it later,” Lin Jiangxian said. The short interaction between the two sparked unhappiness from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion other than Chang Jun and Xi Ruo. It wasn’t because they didn’t trust Lin Jiangxian’s eyesight, but that they couldn’t believe their talent was inferior to someone from a barbaric realm.

Wu Yuhua was happy, and asked, “Brother Lin, you’ve hidden yourself deeply. Were you the one who saved me?”

“Why don’t you take a guess?” Lin Yun asked.

“Ah?” Wu Yuhua was dumbfounded since he had just casually spoken. He didn’t expect Lin Yun to not deny it.

They then started heading deeper into the Blood Mist Swamp together. As they got closer to the center, the aura released by the Sovereign Monument became clearer, with everyone sensing its immense power.

Ten days later, they were stopped by a lake. It might be a lake, but the scale was no different from an ocean.

The Sovereign Monument was at the far end of the lake. This was only an image of it, but the image alone gave off a powerful aura, causing the surrounding lake to cave in. Many cultivators have also gathered in the surroundings, but they were still waiting to take a step forward.

“This is the Sovereign Monument? Just the image of it can stop so many Saints…” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked.
