Chapter 1550 - Comprehending At The Lake's Heart

Tian Xuanzi’s figure was like a faint golden lotus that appeared outside the Nether Divinity War Realm’s entrance. When he appeared, a figure flew over and respectfully stood beside him. This person wore black, accompanied by a black belt and a bamboo hat.

“Zhuge Qingyun pays my respects to Master!” This person was Tian Xuanzi’s strongest disciple, Zhuge Qingyun, who was known to be invincible beneath the saints.

“Greetings, Saint Sovereign!” There were six black figures a few thousand meters behind Zhuge Qingyun, and they were all emitting terrifying saint auras. They were all Saint Realm experts of the Profound Sky Sect. All the saints were there, aside from the Grand Elder, who had to protect the sect.

If someone else was there, they would definitely be shocked that there was a powerful sect with so many saints, aside from the Sword Sect.

Tian Xuanzi furrowed his brows, looking at the six saints. He wasn’t too happy about their presence being here, “Why are you all here?”

“Master was going to meet the Nether Divinity Ancestor, and we’re worried.” Zhuge Qingyun calmly replied. In his view, he was only doing what was right for him. He continued, “Master can punish me if you want to punish anyone for this.”

Tian Xuanzi’s face changed as he silently looked at Zhuge Qingyun. Among his disciples, only Zhuge Qingyun had no respect for him. If it were Qin Cang, the latter definitely wouldn’t dare to say a word. But it didn’t matter to Tian Xuanzi because everyone had their own personality, and Tian Xuanzi didn’t like to suppress his disciples’ characters.

“No need to be so alarmed.”

“But the Nether Divinity Ancestor is at the pinnacle of the Saint Realm and was comparable to the Radiant Sword Saint back then.” Zhuge Qingyun argued. The Nether Divinity Ancestor was an old monster within the Ancient Barren Domain. If the Sword Sect didn’t have the Radiant Sword Saint back then, the Ancient Barren Domain would have already been devoured by the Nether Divinity Clan.

Even when the Radiant Sword Saint was heavily injured, the Nether Divinity Ancestor didn’t take a step out of the Nether Divinity War Realm. This alone was because of the Radiant Sword Saint’s prestige. So it was unavoidable for Zhuge Qingyun to be worried that Tian Xuanzi suddenly wanted to visit the Nether Divinity War Realm.

“Are there any movements from the Sword Sect?” Tian Xuanzi asked, changing the topic.

“The Heavenly Note Sect’s sect master and the Profound Valley’s valley master both immediately rushed to the Sword Sect, and they’re still there. The Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s pavilion lord is on the way there. But there aren’t any movements from the Thunder Sect, Vajra Monastery, and Emerald Jade Manor.” Zhuge Qingyun replied.

“The Profound Valley has also gone there? This is interesting…” Tian Xuanzi was briefly surprised.

Under the bamboo hat, Zhuge Qingyun was filled with admiration for his master, because this was equivalent to taking three birds down with one stone. Not only was the Nether Divinity Clan weakened, deepening the hatred between the Sword Sect and Nether Divinity Clan. They also managed to see who were the Sword Sect’s allies from this incident, thus dividing the eight powerful sects.

Tian Xuanzi was truly surprised when he heard that. He wasn’t surprised that the Heavenly Note Sect would visit the Sword Sect. After all, he knew that the sect master, Lin Wan, had a deep relationship with Mu Xuankong. But the Profound Valley had surprised him.

Amongst the eight powerful sects, the Profound Valley had the most remarkable attainments in spiritual runes. It had always been neutral, never taking sides with any force. But they joined the Sword Sect’s side this time?

“Master, should we investigate this matter?” Zhuge Qingyun naturally saw through what his master was thinking.

“No need. Mere ants can’t shake an elephant, and they will all die when the time comes.” Tian Xuanzi’s face became eerily cold.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Back at the Sword Sect, it was protected by layers of arrays, and one could sense how dangerous those arrays were. Those arrays could even take the life of a saint. It was the famous Nine Firmament Sword Array of the Sword Sect.

A beard-stubbled middle-aged man was looking at the Sword Sect from afar. He briefly furrowed his brows before raising his voice. His voice was loud and contained a wisp of annoyance. “Mu Xuankong, come out to welcome your guest. I’m here!”

Mu Xuankong was in a hall, chatting with a man and a woman. The man was handsome and elegant, the valley master of the Profound Valley. The woman was gorgeous and charming, the sect master of the Heavenly Note Sect.

The two immediately came when they heard that Mu Xuankong slew Qin Xiao. They were naturally here to prevent the Profound Sky Sect from using this matter as an excuse to attack the Sword Sect. After all, everyone knew that the Nether Divinity Clan had a deep connection with the Profound Sky Sect.

“Tian Xuanzi didn’t come, but that fellow came, instead.” The Profound Valley’s valley master smiled. Only the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s pavilion master, Chen Yu, had such a fiery temper amongst the eight powerful sects.

“Tian Xuanzi probably won’t be coming. You two can return first, and I’m grateful for your arrival.” Mu Xuankong smiled while cupping his hands.

The Profound Valley’s valley master stood up and replied, “Then, I’ll be taking my leave first. Sect Master Mu, you can rest assured that the Profound Valley will do our best to help if the Sword Sect has any difficulties.”

Mu Xuankong nodded his head and cupped his hands together. Looking at the silhouette of the Profound Valley’s valley master, Mu Xuankong was truly surprised this time. He never thought that Tang Jing, whom Lin Yun risked his life to save, would be the youngest son of the valley master. After the Sword Emperor brought Tang Jing back, he gave credit to Lin Yun. This was why the valley master would now stand on the Sword Sect’s side.

“Xuankong, I’ll be leaving first. You take care of yourself.” Lin Wan revealed a gentle smile before she left with much reluctance. It had been years since they met, and she knew it would be hard for them to meet again.

After the two left, the beard-stubbled middle-aged man swiftly entered the hall the moment the array was lifted. When he entered, he impatiently asked, “Mu Xuankong, you really grasped the Sword Domain?”

The two fought for decades ever since they became the sect master of their respective sects. They had been evenly matched, so he couldn’t maintain his composure when he heard that Mu Xuankong grasped the Sword Domain and slew Qin Xiao.

“I guess so.” Mu Xuankong smiled.

“I don’t believe you. Don’t move. Let me try slashing you!” The beard-stubbled middle-aged man drew his blade and swung it down at Mu Xuankong. It was fortunate that no one else was there, or they would have been shocked by this scene.

This also scared Mu Xuankong into breaking out in a cold sweat. But he didn’t hesitate to wave his hand, having sword rays form into a domain.

When the beard-stubbled middle-aged man’s attack was hindered, he wielded his blade with both hands, tearing apart the sword rays to Mu Xuankong’s head. But as dazzling golden light radiated from Mu Xuankong’s forehead. No matter how the middle-aged man tried to force his blade down, he couldn’t reach Mu Xuankong.

When the golden light reached a limit, it suddenly gushed out and sent the beard-stubbled middle-aged man flying. As the latter threw out a mouthful of blood, he started cursing, “Fuck, it’s really the Sword Domain. But your sword intent is only at the pinnacle seventh stage. So how did you manage to do it? I’m not any weaker than you!”

“Join the Sword Sect, and I’ll teach you.” Mu Xuankong said, looking at the beard-stubbled middle-aged man.

“Get lost!” The beard-stubbled middle-aged man cursed before he left, and his voice echoed, “Mu Xuankong, don’t die so easily. I’ll come again when my Blade Domain is formed!”

Mu Xuankong was briefly stunned before a smile rose on his lips. He and the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s pavilion master were friends, and they had fought intensely back then. After they became saints, Mu Xuankong would reminisce about the time when they were young.

“Time to give Martial Uncle a greeting.” Mu Xuankong muttered, and he soon appeared where the Radiant Sword Saint was in seclusion. This place was covered in plum blossoms.

The Radiant Sword Saint raised his head to look at Mu Xuankong, “You’re here?”

“Yeah.” Mu Xuankong nodded.

“Let’s go.” The Radiant Sword Saint and Mu Xuankong both appeared on the Celestial Observing Stage, looking at the youth seated at the lake’s heart.

“Mhm?” Mu Xuankong was surprised when he looked at Lin Yun because he could see a massive moon under the lake blazing with flames. The sword intent in the flames was so terrifying that even saints would be alarmed. But Lin Yun had perfectly fused with the dao rhyme.

“He seems to be searching for the opportunity left by the Sword Emperor…” Mu Xuankong muttered.

“Not exactly.” The Radiant Sword Saint smiled as he stroked his beard, “He was personally given an opportunity by the Sword Emperor, and he’s here to comprehend it.”

“Looks like Yu Qingfeng is pretty fond of this fellow. But Lin Yun is a disciple of my Sword Sect, and he can’t snatch him away.” Mu Xuankong smiled.

“That’s for sure. After all, Lin Yun is my disciple.” The Radiant Sword Saint proudly replied.

“Martial Uncle, you can’t leave Saint Mountain for long with your injuries. I’ll look after him.” Mu Xuankong said.

“It’s fine. I’ll return shortly, so you don’t have to look after him. Just keeping some of your attention on him will do.” The Radiant Sword Saint shook his head.
