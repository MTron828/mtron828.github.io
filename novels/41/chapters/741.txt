Chapter 742 - Swordman's Heart

Lin Yun’s face changed when he sensed the powerful aura. He rushed towards the city wall and saw an ape demonic beast that was over three hundred meters talls. Its eyes were covered in a demonic aura that blazed with flames. When Lin Yun saw this demonic beast, his eyes narrowed.

“Mountainshaking Demonic Ape!” Long Hao arrived next to Lin Yun and continued, “A quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast with an overlord bloodline. That lord won’t be able to face this demonic beast. We won’t be able to protect the city.”

The ground trembled when the colossal ape moved as everyone else looked like ants compared to it. Once it appeared, Inkwater City was shrouded in horror. Even the cultivators were filled with fear when they saw this demonic beast, not to mention the commoners inside the city.

Next to the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape were countless demonic beasts that were headed towards Inkwater city. The killing intent that they accumulated placed massive pressure on the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm old man.

The old man wore a grave expression as he knew that the city would fall if he couldn’t stop this demonic beast. As his eyes flickered, he charged towards the demonic beast under countless shocked gazes.

His movement technique was so fast to the point that he drew lightning in his path, reaching before the demonic beast in the blink of an eye. His size was insignificant in comparison to the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape, but his aura wasn’t any weaker.

“Star Annihilation Flash!” The old man summoned his spear, which lit up the sky as the old man completely unleashed his aura and brought out his full strength. The light reflected off the spear tip and defined his face clearly.

Lin Yun was shocked because he could tell that the old man was going to use his strongest attack. Putting himself in the demonic ape’s position, Lin Yun wasn’t confident that he could take the old man’s attack unscathed. He could survive it if he was lucky, but he would be dead if he wasn’t. He wasn’t confident of facing this attack even with the Azure Dragon Enneaform.

But right at this moment, there were lots of demonic beasts behind the ape working together to carry a three hundred meter tall stone pillar. The Mountainshaking Demonic Ape lifted the stone pillar with ease and swung it towards the old man, crushing his attack.

Having his attack destroyed, the old man threw up some blood and went flying. When he landed on the ground, a demonic beast instantly bit his leg. Before he could even move, countless demonic beasts came up and piled on top of him.

As the old man yelled out in pain, he was torn into pieces. Just like that, a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm expert was killed by the horde of demonic beasts.

The Mountainshaking Demonic Ape revealed a sinister smile before it unleashed a ferocious roar towards the sky.

“D-dead?” This scene left many people shocked as they never expected that the old man would die so quickly. Without the old man, the city wall was instantly broken by demonic beasts as the horde charged into the city.

The surrounding cultivators instantly fell to the siege and were trapped. The tables turned so fast and completely surpassed everyone’s expectations.

When the cultivators on the city wall recovered, they began to escape for their lives, leaving the city in a state of hell. Countless people yelled in pain as the commoners were powerless before the horde. It didn’t matter if they were unwilling as they had no other option but to be torn apart by the demonic beasts.

“That lord underestimated the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape. Under the ominous aura, this overlord demonic beast is akin to a monarch demonic beast,” sighed Long Hao with dim eyes.

Lin Yun also looked dejected as an individual’s strength was indeed insignificant before such a disaster. The old man’s death was also what Lin Yun feared the most. He didn’t want to be torn into pieces by countless demonic beasts that he could easily kill.

“Let’s go. We have to leave before the demonic beasts engulf this place. Aside from Swordmire City, nowhere is safe now.” Long Hao persuaded Lin Yun to leave. But when he turned around, he saw Lin Yun charging towards the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape.

“What are you trying to do?” Long Hao’s face changed at this scene.

“Save my friends.” Lin Yun saw that Zuo Yun and Feng Ye were both trapped as the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape was butchering Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts. He didn’t want to give his life for a bunch of strangers, but he didn’t mind putting his life at risk for his friends.

Amid the chaos, Lin Yun swung his sword as he headed towards the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape. It didn’t take long for his azure clothes to be covered in blood and he could finally see the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape clearly.

“N-n-no! I don’t want to die!” A Violet Palace Realm cultivator was grabbed by the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape before he was crushed to death. While this cultivator was killed, the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape also swung the stone pillar at the ground, crushing a few cultivators into meat paste.

Lin Yun saw that Zuo Yun and Feng Ye were sent flying as they vomited blood. Then, Lin Yun took nine steps, leaving behind nine afterimages that swung a sword that raidated like a purple moon. All nine attacks killed the demonic beasts that were pouncing at him.

“Lin Yun!” Feng Ye rejoiced when he saw Lin Yun because he nearly lost his life.

Lin Yun nodded his head and looked around. He noticed that aside from the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape, the other demonic beasts weren’t that terrifying. Perhaps the situation wasn’t as bad as he had imagined.

“Let’s leave first. There are some commoners fleeing the city. I’ll hold back the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape before meeting up with you guys later.” Lin Yun instantly made his decision.

“What are you thinking about? We should leave together. The city has already been penetrated,” yelled Feng Ye.

Lin Yun looked at Zuo Yun, who nodded his head and pulled Feng Ye away.

“Let me go, Lin Yun will die!” Feng Ye raged as he tried to break free from Zuo Yun. But to his surprise, Zuo Yun managed to restrain him easily with one hand. It turned out that without him knowing, all the people he knew had surpassed him.

“Let him go. He’s a swordsman, so he won’t change his mind easily,” said Zuo Yun as he swept his glance out at the city, trying to find the weakest spot. Many Violet Palace Realm experts had left, which resulted in the city being surrounded by demonic beasts.

As long as he could find a weak spot, some people wouldn’t have to die. But that was on the prerequisite that Lin Yun could hold back the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape.

While everyone searched for an opportunity, the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s attack came crashing down at Lin Yun. The attack was so strong that it left a huge crater on the ground and a shockwave that traveled through the city.

Lin Yun calmly brandished his sword, destroying the incoming shockwave while his clothes fluttered violently in the wind.

When the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape stared at Lin Yun, it unleashed an immense pressure on him. Lin Yun pushed his sword intent to the limit as he tore a hole in the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s aura.

His xiantian sword intent was in complete mastery and he could sense that the bottleneck had loosened up which made his xiantian sword intent even more powerful.

Before the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape could unleash a roar, Lin Yun landed on the stone pillar as he charged over. His sword intent was accumulating as he ran and his sword intent lit up like fireflies all around him.

“Is he insane?” This scene left Long Hao completely dumbfounded.
