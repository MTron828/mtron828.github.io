Chapter 2158 - Baptism Light

Gu Xiyan fought Tian Gu mainly to protect the honor of the Heavenly Paths’ champions. So this battle was naturally the center of attention for everyone.

“Gu Xiyan actually didn’t have to stand out. He could wait till Tian Gu finishes fighting Ye Qingtian.”

“Tian Gu is more difficult to deal with than Gu Xinyu, and I’m afraid Gu Xiyan won’t be able to gain much advantage in the fight.”

“Gu Xinyu was too arrogant. He knew that his opponent possessed the Astral Sword Intent, and yet he still dared to let Ye Qingtian make three moves first. In the end, he couldn’t even unleash the Red Lotus Karma Flame…”

“Perhaps he thought that the Red Lotus Karma Flame was invincible. Compared to him, Tian Gu might seem arrogant, but he’s actually a cautious person.” The cultivators on the Dragon Mountain were discussing among themselves.

Gu Xinyu’s defeat made Tian Gu more cautious.

“Ye Qingtian, who do you think will win this fight?” Ji Zixi asked, looking at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun shook his head because he couldn’t tell now. Both Gu Xiyan and Tian Gu had many trump cards that they had yet to demonstrate. Tian Gu gave him a decisive feeling, and he didn’t have to reveal his demonic eye in his fight with the Canaan Hall’s holy son because it could be considered a powerful trump card.

But he was decisive and judged that the Canaan Hall’s holy son would inflict heavy injuries on him. This was why he brought out his trump card without any hesitation. Compared to Gu Xinyu, Tian Gu was more cautious.

“You slaughtered your way from the lesser realms?” Tian Gu asked as he radiated with a silver radiance.

“That’s right. I was fortunate to gain some fame because of it,” Gu Xiyan said indifferently.

“There’s no luck since you can slaughter your way out of the Heavenly Path. Since you want to take on this battle on Ye Qingtian’s behalf, let me see your strength, then!” Tian Gu said as he spread his arms apart with a crimson seal on his palm. In the next moment, the crimson seal began to revolve with countless scriptures flying out.

“Starfall Annihilation Palm!” Tian Gu didn’t underestimate Gu Xiyan and unleashed his trump card right from the start with a vertical eye appearing on his forehead. He didn’t just execute a powerful martial technique but also his demonic eye. As a crimson palm descended from the sky, it pressed down at Gu Xiyan. At the same time, the demonic eye unleashed a powerful pressure to clash with Gu Xiyan’s aura head-on.

“Myriad Incinerating Flame Palm!” Gu Xiyan wasn’t afraid as lightning began to flicker on him. Flames also blazed on his palm as fire and lightning began to merge into an ancient beast behind Gu Xiyan. This was an indigo Qilin enveloped in lightning.

“The Qilin’s inheritance…” Lin Yun squinted and couldn’t recall who had mentioned it before. This should be the Qilin’s inheritance, the Lightning Qilin in particular.

The Qilins were mysterious existences, but they weren’t weaker than the likes of the Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, and White Tiger. To a certain extent, they were even stronger, instead. As a result, those who could receive their inheritances were undoubtedly blessed with fortune.

When the two palms clashed, a loud explosion was produced along with a horrifying shockwave. Lightning, flames, crimson radiance, and silver radiance swept out along with saint dao.

Tian Gu took a few steps back before he managed to regain his footing, and his facial expression became grave. On the contrary, Gu Xiyan had a more relaxed expression and merely took a deep breath to stabilize himself.

This naturally shocked Tian Gu since he had resorted to the power of his bloodline. When he brought out his third eye, the aura that he gave off was comparable to Quasi-Saints at the Heavenly Origin Phase. But he failed to intimidate Gu Xiyan.

He gritted his teeth, “I don’t believe that your Qilin’s Inheritance is that strong!”

There were many Qilins, and the Thunder Qilin was one of them. Furthermore, the Thunder Qilin didn’t have the purest bloodline among the Qilins. Tian Gu understood this kind of inheritance well, so he no longer had any reservation in using his third eye.

His third eye was like a silver star that unleashed a boundless demonic aura that was comparable to Quasi-Saints at the Heavenly Origin Phase. In just the blink of an eye, they both exchanged over a dozen moves, but Gu Xiyan was holding his ground well.

Gu Xiyan had grasped two greater daos, not to mention that he seemed to have fused the two greater daos into himself. So after a hundred moves, the pressure that Tian Gu felt increased.

When the other divine dragon lords saw this scene, they were shocked.

The White Dragon Lord was Ye Linghao, the champion of the Second Heavenly Path. He said with a grave expression, “Gu Xiyan possesses the strength to confront Quasi-Saints at the Heavenly Origin Phase.”

After reaching the Heavenly Origin Phase, one would be able to form their own sacred flame. Relying on sacred flame alone, one could easily burn most Quasi-Saints at the Indigo Origin Phase to death, and not even saint dao could withstand it.

Judging from how it looks now, both Tian Gu and Gu Xiyan possessed trump cards to face Quasi-Saints at the Heavenly Origin Phase head-on. After a more comprehensive comparison, Gu Xiyan seemed to have more confidence in this fight.

“The Qilin Saint Physique is a little terrifying, and it’s not any weaker than my Great Sun Saint Physique,” the Dao Yang Holy Son said. He was publicly known to possess the strongest physique on the Blue Dragon Record. Since he said that, one could imagine how powerful the Qilin Saint Physique was.

“It looks like we can’t underestimate the Champions of the Heavenly Paths,” the Red Dragon Lord said. He was the holy son of the Northern Ridge’s Aurora Light Sect. He had started to look down on the Champions of the Heavenly Paths after seeing them being defeated one by one. But he now realized that he couldn’t look down on them.

Right then, a loud explosion occurred as Gu Xiyan threw his punch forth, accompanied by lightning and flames. Along with a Qilin’s roar, Gu Xiyan’s right hand manifested into a Qilin that shattered the thirty-six layers of heaven. The lightning also left cracks in the surrounding space as Tian Gu was sent flying away before he threw out a mouthful of blood.

As Tian Gu fell to the ground, he let out a roar with the demonic eye shining brightly, unleashing a powerful mental attack directed at Gu Xiyan’s soul.

“What pitiful tricks.” Gu Xiyan hovered in the air like a deity while giving off a powerful aura. As the Qilin phenomenon let out a roar, he dashed forth and shattered the mental attack.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Myriad Incinerating Flame Palm!” Gu Xiyan roared, unleashing the same attack. But the phenomenon was different this time as lightning and fire fused into a gigantic sword that flew out with a flick of his finger.

When the giant sword descended from the sky, it sent Tian Gu flying back. But that wasn’t all as Gu Xiyan manipulated the sword from afar, fully exhibiting the power of the sword.

Facing the incoming attack, Tian Gu waved his hands, unleashing multiple punches. But whenever his punch came in contact with the sword, he would take a step back, forcing him to retreat.

He was forced to retreat to the Dragon’s Torso before being pushed to the waist of the mountain. On the contrary, Gu Xiyan hovered in the air with his hair fluttering, and he didn’t take a step back.

“Three thousand daos, and I will dominate them all!” Gu Xiyan roared as the two greater daos completely fused together, and he clenched his hand into a fist. The giant sword also began to squirm as it formed into a giant fist that descended down at a rapid speed.

Under his punch, a large crater appeared on Dragon Mountain. Even when Tian Gu tried his best to dodge, he was still caught by the shockwave of the attack.

Tian Gu did his best to control his figure, wanting to execute his secret spatial technique. But he realised that the surrounding space was covered in cracks from the greater daos’ pressure, rendering his secret spatial technique useless.

This repeated for a few times as Tian Gu continued to roll down the mountain. After lightning and fire combined into a lotus, a lotus would appear whenever Gu Xiyan took a step forth, and he soon caught up to the heavily injured Tian Gu.

Gu Xiyan knew that Tian Gu could swiftly recover from his injuries unless he really managed to attack his vitals. The Canaan Hall’s holy son lost because of that, and Gu Xiyan didn’t want to make the same mistake.

“Qilin Finger!”

When Tian Gu struggled back onto his feet, a powerful ray of light pierced through space, aimed at his vertical eye. This instantly brought fear to Tian Gu’s eyes as he quickly shut the vertical eye.

But when the beam reached Tian Gu’s forehead, it pierced through his head without any hindrance.

The surroundings fell silent as everyone was shocked by this move. Was this Gu Xiyan’s true strength? It was too unbelievable to combine the Qilin Saint Physique with two greater daos. This was a great shock to everyone.

Even so, Gu Xiyan’s attack failed to claim Tian Gu’s life. Even so, Tian Gu had panicked and had no intentions of competing for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position anymore. He quickly turned around to flee while turning into black demonic flames and fused into space, wanting to use his spatial secret technique to flee.

“Myriad Incinerating Flame—Baptism Light!” Gu Xiyan calmly clasped his hands together as the flower consisting of Thunder and Fire Daos bloomed. As the two daos began to fuse, an indigo radiance soon filled the surrounding space.

This scene was too shocking and it also took many people by surprise. The dazzling light stung many people’s eyes to the point of bleeding.

When the radiance settled down, Tian Gu’s body was revealed. Tian Gu’s body was riddled with holes as though he was stabbed with countless needles. When Tian Gu fell to the ground, his body began to crumble like charcoal, leaving behind a silver eye. But before the silver eye could escape, it was squashed by Gu Xiyan with a stomp on the ground.

“Tian Gu is dead?” Everyone was shocked because Gu Xiyan was too ruthless. He had already inflicted heavy injuries on Tian Gu, but he didn’t let Tian Gu go and took his life, leaving everyone dumbfounded.

“Saint Elder, he didn’t surrender. So it’s not against the rules for me to kill him, right?” Gu Xiyan raised his head and calmly looked at Mu Xueling.

Mu Xueling was also shocked by how ruthless Gu Xiyan was. She replied, “You didn’t violate the rules.”

Nodding his head, Gu Xiyan stomped on the ground, before turning into a streak of lightning and returned to the Dragon’s Head of the Blue Dragon.

But everyone still hadn’t come to their senses from the fight between Gu Xiyan and Tian Gu. Judging from how ruthless Gu Xiyan was, anyone could tell that Gu Xiyan made the move with the intention of taking Tian Gu’s life.

Those who fought Tian Gu earlier began to feel a chill down their spines, and finally realized how fortunate they were. They were fortunate that Gu Xiyan wasn’t a bloodthirsty person, or they would have been heavily injured even if they weren’t killed.

“Don’t ever compete with those from the Heavenly Paths in terms of ruthlessness. They’re a bunch of monsters.”

“There are rumors that the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking wanted to rank him first, but he gave it up on his own accord.”

“It’s a pity that Flower Burial isn’t here. I really wanted to see their fight.” Gu Xiyan’s performance was too shocking. Everyone was initially concerned that the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan might mess up the Blue Dragon Record. But one was defeated by Ye Qingtian while the other was killed by Gu Xiyan, and this was already the best outcome possible.

As everyone talked amongst themselves, they found it a pity that Flower Burial wasn’t here. If Flower Burial was here, the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position would either go to him or Gu Xiyan, and they could all know who was the strongest amongst the Champions of the Heavenly Paths.

“Holy shit.” Ji Zixi exclaimed as she watched Gu Xiyan returning to his throne.

“Ye Qingtian, Gu Xiyan seems to be more dashing than you,” Ji Zixi smiled as she turned around to look at Ye Qingtian.

Lin Yun was also shocked by the strength Gu Xiyan displayed. Gu Xiyan gave him a berserker feeling with no techniques in it, using brute strength to suppress his opponent, and this was terrifying.

“Do you still want to compete for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position?” Ji Zixi asked with interest.

When she said that, everyone pricked their ears, wanting to hear Ye Qingtian’s answer.

But Lin Yun merely smiled, and said, “Right from the start, I only used half of my strength. So what do you think?”

Ji Zixi was briefly stunned before she said, “I now believe why everyone says that you’re arrogant. Compared to you, Gu Xinyu is considered polite.”

Ji Zixi naturally didn’t believe in what Ye Qingtian said. The other geniuses also looked at Ye Qingtian with disdain, and this brought a bitter smile to Lin Yun’s face because it was too hard for him to tell the truth.
