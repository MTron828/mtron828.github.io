Chapter 937 - Mysterious Lady

If there was something that could attract this woman’s attention, it would be the Glorysun Spirit. Plus, the fact that she followed Lin Yun for so long proved that she was at least in the top 30 on the Azure Dragon Ranking. In fact, she might even be in the top 15.

Then again, all of this was just Lin Yun’s speculation. There was no way Lin Yun could give away the Glorysun Spirit. He had been comprehending it for a long time and still had no idea how to break the seal. It was really hard for someone of his cultivation to break the seal.

But very quickly, Lin Yun had a solution. If this lady wanted to come after him, he would use the Indigoflame Thunderwhip. However, it all depended on the flaws that she revealed.

“Lad, have you made up your mind? Do you really want to see me?” The charming voice sounded out once more.

“Come on out,” said Lin Yun calmly while looking around.

“Behind you.” The voice chuckled.

When Lin Yun heard that, he quickly turned around. Then, he saw a woman slowly walking forward with a ray of sunlight shining down on her. She wore a long purple dress with a slit that went up to her waist, revealing her pearly white legs. Her dress was also low cut, which revealed her large chest.

Although she wore a veil to cover her face, her pupils looked like they could captivate the soul of any man in the world. All of this was enough to make Lin Yun’s heart throb. He had seen many women, but no one aside from Xin Yan had this level of seduction.

“I didn’t lie to you, right? Those who see me either lose their soul or their life.” The lady revealed a bewitching smile, but Lin Yun showed no signs of enjoyment. He was extremely wary because he could sense that this lady was in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Lin Yun didn’t dare to move, so he simply smiled, “Indeed. But I don’t wish to lose my soul or life. You’re here for the Glorysun Spirit, right? If you can afford the price, I can consider selling it to you.”

“The Glorysun Spirit?” The lady was briefly stunned before she smiled, “So you’re the one who took the Azure Dragon Region’s Glorysun Spirit. How impressive, but I’m not here for that. No one can break the seal and I’m not interested in the other astral spirits. If there’s something I have some interest in, it’s your sword and martial techniques.”

She’s not from the Azure Dragon Region? Lin Yun never would have thought that this lady didn’t belong to the Azure Dragon Region. In the Heavenly Path, there were a total of four regions - azure dragon, vermillion bird, black tortoise, and white tiger. Which region is she from? If she wanted to snatch the Flower Burial Sword or the Divine Glorysun Fist, then she wouldn’t bother talking to Lin Yun.

“Hehe, look how anxious you are. I’m just saying that I have a little interest.” The lady examined Lin Yun’s expression before she smiled, “Actually, I’m more interested in you. What relationship do you have with that vixen, Yue Weiwei? That vixen has caused a lot of trouble in the other regions. She even came over to take a look at you. It seems like she’s pretty concerned about you.”

Upon hearing Yue Weiwei’s name, Lin Yun’s face finally changed, “What trouble did she cause? Did she cause more trouble than me?”

“Your trouble? The Bloodbone Realm?” The lady smiled in disdain when she mentioned the Bloodbone Realm. But she didn’t continue and kept examining Lin Yun’s expression. She could see that Lin Yun’s face had changed drastically when she mentioned Yue Weiwei. It seemed like they had a relationship. Those idiots only know how to chase after Yue Weiwei, by the time they recover, it will be too late.

“Young fellow, come with me obediently.” The lady smiled and a flaming spear appeared in her hand. Out of nowhere, she pulled out a greater dao artifact. With a smile, she manipulated the aura from her spear to crush Lin Yun.

But before her spear could descend, a dragon enveloped in purple lightning flames gushed out. The dragon was a few hundred meters long with horns growing out of its head. Based on its violent aura, it looked like an ancient demonic beast that had traveled through time and space.

The lady was surprised when she saw the dragon and didn’t hesitate to stab its head with her spear. Just like that, they exchanged a few earth-shattering moves. In the end, Lin Yun flicked his wrist and the Indigoflame Thunderwhip exploded violently. The entire dragon came to life as it forced the lady backwards.

“Lil’ Red!” Lin Yun yelled as he threw the Indigoflame Thunderwhip to Lil’ Red.

Lil’ Red, who was in the cat form, grabbed the Indigoflame Thunderwhip with great agility. It had been waiting for some time to join the battle. When Lil’ Red grabbed the whip, the dragon suddenly grew over three thousand meters long and evolved into a three-clawed dragon.

The powerful dragon aura swept towards the lady and its pressure restricted her from moving for a moment.

Taking advantage of the moment, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he drew his sword. His sword aura formed an ocean full of lotuses. As his dazzling sword ray shined out, the lady who was restricted was split in half. At the same time, the Indigoflame Thunderwhip came crashing down.

In just a short period of time, heaven and earth started to tremble violently as the surrounding space became unstable.

When the Indigoflame Thunderwhip returned to its whip form, Lil’ Red landed on Lin Yun’s shoulder. However, it was still wary and wore a grave expression.

“Is it over?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as his face changed. Facing the mysterious lady who was in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, Lin Yun had no choice but to use the Indigoflame Thunderwhip. But even so, he had no confidence that he could win or even escape.

Although he used the Indigoflame Thunderwhip, he still unleashed a barrage of attacks to prevent the lady from catching her breath. Otherwise, he would have died after she recovered. After all, when someone’s strength reached a certain level, all other means became useless tricks.

The cloud of dust slowly dissipated as the lady appeared once more. This time around, her face was a little pale. Looking at Lin Yun, she smiled, “Little brother, you’re really ruthless!”

Additionally, the lady had surprise in her eyes because the whip looked like a transcendent dao artifact from ancient times. If Lin Yun’s cultivation wasn’t so low, he could easily unleash all of the whip’s power and fight her to a stalemate. He might be one of the dark horses at the end of the Heavenly Path.

“She’s still alive!” Lin Yun wore a grave expression and became more nervous than he had ever been. Since he started using the Three Heavenly Divides, he had never failed to kill someone. This fact made him confident in his attacks and made them more ferocious.

However, this was the first time that his attack had failed. He failed to kill his opponent and failed to destroy his opponent’s defensive dao artifact.

He could sense cracks in his confidence that weren’t there before. The current situation was beyond his control, so he would mend the cracks in the future. If he couldn’t, the power of the Three Heavenly Divides would fall.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed and he suddenly spoke, “You’re injured right now.”

The lady wasn’t bothered when she heard that. With a smile, she said, “I was by that little lover of yours. But who would have thought you would be so ruthless. Your sword nearly made my heart drop.”

As she spoke, she held onto her chest full of heartache. All of a sudden, Lin Yun was certain that she had a grudge with Yue Weiwei. His face sank as he replied, “I advise you not to go after Yue Weiwei. If you dare to harm a single strand of her hair, I swear that I’ll make you regret it!”

“Hehe, don’t be so ferocious and scare me,” smiled the lady. “You better leave with me. With how handsome you are, I guarantee that I won’t harm you.”

Although her words were domineering, it was hard for anyone to be enraged since she was so graceful. “You can come with me instead,” retorted Lin Yun.

The lady was briefly stunned when she heard that, “I guess you and that vixen have a strong affinity for each other. But even if I leave with you, your little vixen will still be in danger. There are a lot of people going after her. Furthermore…”

The lady looked at Lin Yun and asked seductively, “Can you bear me?”

Lin Yun was having a hard time facing her temptation, so he smiled, “I’ll get going first.”

When he said that, Lil’ Red swung the Indigoflame Thunderwhip. It manifested into a dragon and locked onto the lady, which made her face change. However, when she wanted to react, she realized that Lil’ Red had already dispersed the aura of the transcendent dao artifact. Because of that, she was restricted by the Indigoflame Thunderwhip and trapped for the time being.

“We’ll meet again in the future. But remember what I said. Don’t try and harm Yue Weiwei because I don’t wish to harm you.” After Lil’ Red unleashed its attack, it suddenly transformed into an ancient warhorse and soared into the sky with Lin Yun.

The lady was too troublesome, so Lin Yun and Lil’ Red didn’t want to stay any longer.
