Chapter 1415 - Fox

The sudden appearance of the Radiant Snow Clan made both sides nervous, including Lin Yun. He also had his guard against Ye Ziyun because she had been there for a long time. If she wanted to help, she didn’t have to wait till now, and the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party wouldn’t be in such a pathetic state.

As for Xiahou Yan, his face had sunk. Even if the four brothers of the Huang Clan had backed down, Xiahou Yan had no intentions of letting this matter rest. His enmity with Lin Yun wasn’t just because of the Bodhi Seed. He had already flipped the table, so there was no need for them to be polite with each other. But the sudden appearance of the Radiant Snow Clan on the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s side made him unhappy.

“Don’t you think you should provide a reason if you want to interfere?” Xiahou Yan said with his face sinking.

“It’s nothing much. I just wish to befriend Flower Burial. Is that enough for you?” Ye Ziyun smiled. She had no opinion if Xiahou Yan wanted to deal with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but this also allowed her to get close to Lin Yun. This could make Lin Yun owe her one, so there was no reason for her to refuse.

Lin Yun sent a weird look towards Ye Ziyun but didn’t say a word.

“Brother Xiahou, there’s no need to fight them when we’re not even at the sword mound. It’ll only benefit others…” Huang Yancheng transmitted his voice to Xiahou Yan.

Xiahou Yan was ugly because he hated Ye Ziyun. This woman interfered in his matter and even wanted to protect Lin Yun; this was an act of completely disregard towards him. As for wanting to befriend Lin Yun? Did that mean that Lin Yun was more worthy of being befriended than him?

A brief moment later, Xiahou Yan smiled, “Sure. But I suggest you choose your friends well. Otherwise, not even the Ancient Saint Clan might be able to protect you.”

Xiahou Yan turned around without any hesitation. As for Huang Yancheng, his gaze was fixed on Lin Yun, with killing intent surging in his heart. There was a loophole in his words earlier. He said he wouldn’t target the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t target Lin Yun.

When he chased after Xiahou Yan, he said, “Xiahou Yan, we can’t let him go. We can’t kill him in the test… but you should know what I mean.”

“You think I’ll let him go?” Xiahou Yan revealed an eerie smile. “Find an opportunity to cripple him at the sword mound. Doesn’t he want to join the Sword Sect? I’ll make him feel despair and let him know who the boss in the Ancient Barren Domain is!”

“Young Master Lin, you’ve thoroughly offended Xiahou Yan and the Huang Clan’s brothers.” Ye Ziyun smiled as she turned to look at Lin Yun. Her smile was charming and infectious. When she saw Lin Yun being stunned, she then revealed an apologetic smile. “Sorry for not introducing myself. My name is Ye Ziyun, and this is my elder cousin, Ye Qing!”

“Ye Qing pays his greetings. I’ve been hearing your name for a long time, and I’m more impressed after seeing you in person.” Ye Qing flattered Lin Yun.

“There’s no need for you two to be so polite. I know about your names.” Lin Yun smiled. His enmity with Xiahou Yan had been forged. Xiahou Yan wasn’t a generous person, but that didn’t mean that Lin Yun was generous, either.

“Then, I guess we’re friends now.” Ye Ziyun smiled.

“I guess.” Lin Yun replied before he continued, “My senior sister is injured. So I’m afraid I have to look at her condition now.”

He turned around and walked to Ye Ziling when he was done, putting Ye Ziyun in an awkward position. She had just saved Lin Yun, so shouldn’t he express his gratitude? But Lin Yun didn’t seem grateful. It was so much so that he had no intentions of deepening their friendship.

“How’re your injuries?” Lin Yun helped Ye Ziling to her feet. Ye Ziling had a good physique, so she recovered from most of her injuries. But her spirits seemed poor.

When Ye Ziling took a deep breath, she clenched her fist and could sense the circulation of her astral energy. As she tried to move around, she realized that her injuries were no longer hindering her movements, and she had also benefited from her injuries. This allowed her Radiant Snow Bloodline and Divine Dragon Sword Physique’s fusion to reach 60%.

She suddenly understood something. She hadn’t suffered any injuries ever since she unsealed her Radiant Snow Bloodline, nor did she undergo a huge battle. Even on the Profound Wither Island, most of the battles relied on Lin Yun. She needed to train herself further to fuse the two bloodlines completely, and her injuries today weren’t exactly bad.

“Thank you.” Ye Ziling smiled. When she looked at Lin Yun, light shone in her pupils with unprecedented confidence.

“I have no idea what you’re talking about. But don’t forget what you promised me.” Lin Yun winked with a playful smile. While they were chatting, Ye Ziyun and Ye Qing were left to the side. This made Ye Ziyun awkward as she examined Ye Ziling. Unknowingly, her right hand was clenched because this was completely different from what he had imagined.

She should be the one in Ye Ziling’s position, chatting with Lin Yun, while Ye Ziling could only look at them. Afterwards, she would step out and pretend that she hadn’t recognized Ye Ziling, humiliating Ye Ziling, who was once the princess of the Ye Clan. But the development had gone against her imagination.

“Ziyun, what should we do now?” Ye Qing asked.

Ye Ziyun’s face was cold because she was being ignored. But her face changed in the next second as she stepped forth, looking at Ye Ziling with a smile, “Big Sister Ziyun, it has been a long time.”

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed; they knew each other, just as he had speculated.

“Yeah, it has been fifteen years,” said Ye Ziling.

“Sorry about that. I didn’t recognize you earlier.” Ye Ziyun put on an awkward expression and continued, “It has been fifteen years since we last met, so…”

“It’s fine,” replied Ye Ziling calmly, with no fluctuation in her emotions.

Still wearing her smile, Ye Ziyun turned to look at Lin Yun, “Young Master Lin, I wonder if we can talk privately?”

“Go on.” Lin Yun replied politely, with no intention of talking to Ye Ziyun individually.

Gritting her teeth, Ye Ziyun said, “The Barren Sword Mound opens once a century, and we will only have a chance at gathering 100 Spiritual Sword Beads at the sword mound.”

Lin Yun was surprised, but it was more or less the same as he had speculated; the Ancient Saint Clans knew something. When Ye Ziyun saw the changes on Lin Yun’s face, her confidence returned, and she briefly paused to pique Lin Yun’s interest.

But Ye Ziling was snickering on the side as she watched her cousin’s hilarious performance. Her cousin was still the same as before, good at using her beauty. With a smile, countless men in the clan would give her all sorts of pellets just to follow her around. Even being ordered around by her would make them feel honored.

She couldn’t be bothered with what she wanted to do, but it was different if she placed her target on Lin Yun. What was Ye Ziyun thinking? Did she consider herself to be a peerless beauty? Even if she was a beauty, could she compete with Su Ziyao? In her eyes, Ye Ziyun was just asking to be humiliated.

“There will be an outburst of nirvana aura in the sword mound two days from now. A large number of Spiritual Sword Beads will appear. The opening of the Barren Sword Mound every century will give birth to a tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead.” Ye Ziyun looked at Lin Yun.

A tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead meant that there would be ten golden rings in it, containing a boundless sword aura that had accumulated for millennia—hearing that, even Lin Yun couldn’t help being tempted. As for those who still hadn’t grasped the firmament sword intent, this was an excellent opportunity for them to grasp it. So the value of the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead had exceeded their imaginations.

“This is why the Huang Clan’s four brothers have joined forces with Xiahou Yan.” Ye Ziling continued.

“I see…” Lin Yun nodded.

Seeing that Lin Yun didn’t have many changes on his face, Ye Ziyun couldn’t help feeling disappointed. But she then confidently asked, “Young Master Lin, are you interested in joining hands with the Ye Clan?”

“You should ask my senior sister about that.” Lin Yun turned to Ye Ziling.

The corner of Ye Ziyun’s lips twitched because she never expected Lin Yun would hand the decision-making to Ye Ziling. But how could she ask Ye Ziling about it? If Ye Ziling rejected her, wasn’t that the same as asking to be humiliated?

“Lin Yun, are you really not going to consider further? I’ve offended Xiahou Yan earlier…” Ye Ziyun wore a wronged expression as if she was hurt and pitifully looked at Lin Yun.

“Thank you.” Lin Yun said indifferently after thinking for a long time.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Ye Ziyun nearly threw out blood and felt powerless.

“Young Master Lin, are you not going to reconsider?” Ye Ziyun looked at Lin Yun sincerely.

But Lin Yun merely looked at Ye Ziling, which made her speechless. She had never suffered such a setback before. She smiled, “Since that’s the case, I’m sorry to bother you.”

When she turned around, her face instantly became cold and terrifyingly dark. After she left, Ye Ziling smiled, “You’ve offended her deeply. She is a pretty grudgeful person.”

“Didn’t she come to offend you? So it doesn’t matter if I offend her.” Lin Yun replied. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“You knew?” Ye Ziling was surprised to hear what Lin Yun said.

“Isn’t it obvious?” Lin Yun smiled. “She’s a fox, so how can I not know what she’s trying to do?”
