Chapter 2133: Fearless

Lin Yun’s words made Ye Ziling’s heart tremble. Since she was young, no one had treated her so well.

“I’ll stay at the Dragon’s Tail. You can carry on ahead,” Ye Ziling said, fearing that she might drag Lin Yun down. She was satisfied if someone with her strength could have a spot on the Dragon’s Tail. She still had a high chance of obtaining a spot.

“Just follow me.” Lin Yun didn’t say much and used his actions to prove his strength. He didn’t even draw his sword, but no one could stop him. Very quickly, he passed through the Dragon’s Tail and reached the Dragon’s Torso, which was in the third tier.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re truly a role model for us.” A familiar voice resounded. It came from Cao Yang. Cao Yan was a genius of the Ancient Vajra Monastery, and he gained a huge benefit while inside the True Dragon Secret Realm, allowing his strength to skyrocket. He glanced in Lin Yun’s direction earlier and was shocked to see him bringing a woman with him.

After all, the Blue Dragon Record was a grand event, and only Ye Qingtian dared to bring a woman with him without placing anyone in his eyes. As expected of his nickname Holy Maiden Killer. Even someone as arrogant as Cao Yang didn’t dare to be distracted on the True Dragon Path.

“You want to travel together?” Cao Yang threw out an invitation.

“You first,” Lin Yun refused.

“Hehe. I won’t be polite with you then. Let us meet again at the Dragon’s Head.” Cao Yang turned around. He retrieved a spear and roared, “I’m going to start a massacre, so get out of my way if you don’t want to die!”

As Cao Yang swung his spear, he unleashed a dazzling radiance, and no one could take that attack head-on, easily clearing the entire Dragon’s Torso as everyone retreated to the sides.

“Hehe!” Cao Yang grinned as he charged over. When geniuses of the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking became serious, they were practically invincible on the True Dragon Path. The difference was too huge, and even a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase couldn’t take a single attack from them. Those who grasped saint dao had long retreated and dared not face them head-on.

Like that, Cao Yang charged his way through to the Dragon’s Claw, and the Dragon’s Head could be seen. The Dragon’s Claw had ten-odd spots, and Cao Yang could easily have a spot there. But Cao Yang didn’t pay much attention to the Dragon’s Claw and turned to look at the Dragon’s Head. There were three people gathered there at this moment. They were Mo Li, Xiao Hongfei, and Fang Haotian.

“Cao Yang, don’t blame me for being ruthless if you take another step forth. Get lost!” Mo Li said coldly. He looked down on Cao Yang to begin with. So he began mocking him when he saw that Cao Yang wanted to come to the Dragon’s Head.

“The Dragon’s Claw is your belonging. Or do you think you can compete with us just because you’re also on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking?” Fang Haotian had contempt on his face as he mocked.

“You’re not qualified for the Dragon’s Head, so don’t even dream about waiting for us to fight amongst ourselves,” Xiao Hongfei said.

“I insist on competing no matter what!” Cao Yang had been hiding his strength and was determined to obtain a spot on the Dragon’s Head. When Cao Yang activated his Vajra Golden Physique, he emitted a dazzling golden radiance as a holy chant echoed from him ?As saint runes enveloped the spear in his hand, he charged at Xiao Hongfei, who was nearby.

“What speed!” Xiao Hongfei was surprised. He knew that he had underestimated his opponent. He had no choice but to dodge the incoming attack and drew his blade, unleashing a blade ray enveloped in flames directed at Cao Yang.

Cao Yang easily resolved Xiao Hongfei’s attack, and the radiance released by his spear increased, thrusting his sword at Xiao Hongfei.

Xiao Hongfei managed to block the attack with his blade in the nick of time as he retreated. When Mo Li and Fang Haotian saw this scene, a cold light flashed in their eyes, and they charged at Cao Yang together, “You must be courting death!”

Mo Li practiced the Heavenly Note Demonic Canon, grasping the Thunderfrost Intent, and was proficient in music, possessing the Heavenly Note Saint Physique that wasn’t weaker than the Ancient Vajra Physique. On the other hand, Fang Haotian practiced the ominous aura, grasping the Massacre Intent.

“Heavenly Note Descent!”

“Heart Devouring Demonic Claw!” Mo Li and Fang Haotian didn’t hold back as they executed their strongest attacks. As boundless saint aura gushed out from behind them, one had an ancient bell above them, and the other had a demon behind them.

As Cao Yang faced two opponents by himself, he merely lasted ten-odd moves before he couldn’t take it any further, throwing out a mouthful of blood. The soundwave made his soul tremble while the Heart Devouring Demonic Claw ripped a huge chunk of flesh off him. When Cao Yang felt pain and wanted to retaliate, Xiao Hongfei swung his blade, dyeing the sky red, and broke Cao Yang’s Vajra Golden Physique.

Cao Yang collapsed on the ground, looking at the three with a pale face. He instantly came to his senses and realized that Xiao Hongfei, Mo Li, and Fang Haotian had joined hands to prevent anyone from competing for the Dragon’s Head.

“The three of you are despicable to join hands!” Cao Yang pointed at the three with a rage of flames blazing in his heart.

“Don’t join if you can’t afford it. I told you long ago that you don’t deserve to touch the Dragon’s Head!” Xiao Hongfei kicked Cao Yang, sending Cao Yang flying back, knocking many people in his path. If no one stopped him, he might be the first person to roll out of the True Dragon Path.

Xiao Hongfei casually wiped his blade, and said, “Everyone on the True Dragon Path listen up! Don’t bother coming for the Dragon’s Head because we have occupied it. If anyone dares to look at it, don’t blame me for taking your life!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

His voice echoed on the mountain with an arrogance that sparked a huge uproar.

Lin Yun flashed and grabbed Cao Yang, pouring his azure saint aura into the latter to treat the latter’s injury.

When Cao Yang opened his eyes, he looked at Ye Qingtian and said, “Don’t bother going to the Dragon’s Head. The three of them have joined hands, and no one can compete with them. Ye Qingtian, you shouldn’t have come to the True Dragon Path as this place is too complicated.”

He was reluctant but still reminded Ye Qingtian because he didn’t want the latter to follow in his footsteps.

“Aren’t they a little too domineering? Is the Saint Elder not going to interfere?”

“Didn’t you realize there aren’t any rules in the Blue Dragon Record?”

“True experts would naturally overlook the rules. Look at the other dragon mountains. The holy lands and champions of the Heavenly Paths are sweeping their way through, and who would talk about the rules with you?”

“The three of them only dare to act arrogantly on the True Dragon Path.”

“Ye Qingtian is also on the True Dragon Path. Do you think he’ll compete for it? Speaking of which, his fame is even higher than the likes of Fang Haotian!”

“He might have a huge fame, but he’s ranked last on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking.” Xiao Hongfei’s words naturally sparked a public outrage, intimidating many people, and no one dared to say a word.

The Dragon’s Head of the True Dragon Path was in the control of those three. Many people did mention Ye Qingtian since he was a prodigy swordsman in the Heavenly Dao Sect, an underdog with glorious achievements.

Lin Yun raised his head and took a deep breath before walking forth. This shocked Cao Yang because he had already warned Ye Qingtian, but the latter had no intentions of stopping. But seeing this scene, he and Ye Ziling quickly followed behind him.

Many people paid attention to Lin Yun, wanting to make a move against him. After all, Ye Qingtian’s fame was too high, and many people were unhappy with him being on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking.

“Ye Qingtian, take my sword!” Someone couldn’t hold back and a cultivator on the Dragon’s Claw soared to the sky, charging at Lin Yun. His intention was simple: to step on Ye Qingtian under so many eyes to forge his fame. He might be unable to deal with Fang Haotian, Xiao Hongfei, and Mo Li, so he went after Ye Qingtian instead.

His cultivation was at the Indigo Origin Phase, grasping a greater dao. The fact that he could obtain a spot on the Dragon’s Claw was enough to prove his strength.

Lin Yun squinted and raised his hand, using his fingers as a sword, before swinging down. The sword ray released by his opponent was only ten feet, while the one released by Lin Yun was a hundred feet. His sword ray was like a massive river, easily resolving his opponent’s attack.

This shocked the young swordsman before he quickly brought out his saint dao, constellation, and various treasures. He panicked and tried to resist the incoming attack, but his efforts were futile as he fell from the Dragon’s Claw and lost his qualification. This made everyone take a deep breath, and they could feel their scalps going numb. Since when was Ye Qingtian so powerful?

“I have long heard that he’s a genius swordsman, but isn’t his strength too terrifying? A casual sword from him could easily defeat a Quasi-Saint who grasped the saint dao.”

“There’s a good show to watch now. Ye Qingtian is really going to the Dragon’s Head!”

“Is Senior Brother Ye going to seize the Dragon’s Head?” This was naturally noticed by many disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect, and they became emotional.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to be only a few hundred meters from the Dragon’s Head. As Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Fang Haotian, Mo Li, and Xiao Hongfei.

“Ye Qingtian. I knew that you would come,” Mo Li said. The three stood side by side and released a powerful greater dao aura as they stood at the Dragon’s Head, looking at Lin Yun with murderous intent brewing in their eyes. Even an ordinary genius would have to bear great pressure facing the aura they gave off, and it was a problem if they could stand firmly.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re really brave. The Blue Dragon Record isn’t the Sword Assembly, and you’d only be embarrassed if you dare to make a move.” Fang Haotian looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile.

Lin Yun was fearless as he calmly said, “Come at me together. I’m in a hurry.”

“Together? I’m enough to deal with you!” Fang Haotian laughed as he charged forth while Mo Li and Xiao Hongfei retreated to the side.
