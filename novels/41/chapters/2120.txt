Chapter 2121: Experience this Golden Era On My Behalf!

Lin Yun followed Bai Qingyu outside the courtyard. Bai Qingyu wore a grave expression as she pointed in a direction, “There!”

Even without Bai Qingyu’s reminder, Lin Yun had already seen it. He squinted with shock in his eyes. A blue pillar of light pierced through the thirty-six layers of heaven in the northwest. The beam of light was majestic, like a mountain with starlight scattering about. Around the pillar of light were phantoms of legendary beasts coiling around it.

The pillar of light looked close, but it was far. This was because the pillar of light was too majestic, higher than all the mountain ranges within the Eastern Desolation. As a result, everyone within the Eastern Desolation could see the blue light as long as they raised their heads. It was a spectacular scene like an immortal realm.

“It appeared three days ago, and all the holy lands have set off in advance. This place is at the edge of the God Burial Mountain Range,” Bai Qingyu said.

Lin Yun retracted his gaze and said, “Has the sect decided who will participate in the Blue Dragon Record?”

Bai Qingyu said, “Theoretically, all of the saint disciples will go because everyone still doesn’t know the specific rules. We’ll know after we’ve arrived. After all, the last time the Blue Dragon Record appeared was in ancient times, so we’re still not too sure about it yet.”

Lin Yun nodded and recalled something. He asked, “Has the Dao Yang Holy Son returned?”

“They’re all back.” Bai Qingyu smiled, “Do you want to see my elder sister? All of them went into seclusion after they returned, including my elder sister, the Dao Yang Holy Son, Holy Maiden Miao Yin, and the Holy Spirit Son.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he wanted to see Xin Yan. The Heavenly Dao Sect sent the five of them to search for the Emperor's inheritance within the God Burial Mountain Range. All of them were the golden generations of the Heavenly Dao Sect. They were holy sons, maidens, or heirs of the various clans.

According to Bai Qingyu, not only did they receive a huge benefit, they also made it back alive. The Emperor’s inheritance couldn’t be underestimated, and Lin Yun began to wonder what they received.

“I have to make a trip to the Celestial Purging Mountain. You guys chat in the mean time,“ Lin Yun said. After witnessing the phenomenon created by the Blue Dragon Record, Lin Yun’s sense of urgency became stronger. He wanted to see if he could bring his Astral Sword Intent to the pinnacle of complete mastery within the next few days.

Bai Qingyu was sensible, and said, “Okay. I’ll let you know when we’re going to leave.”

“I won’t accompany you. Qingyu, you stay behind. I’ll guide her cultivation over the next few days,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Thank you, Master!” Bai Qingyu’s eyes lit up.

“You might’ve recently taken me as your master, but you can’t embarrass me,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Okay.” Bai Qingyu nodded.

Lin Yun merely glanced at them, but wasn’t too bothered. Bai Qingyu had been left alone to grow and Lil’ Purple was too unreliable. It’d be difficult for her to leave her name on the Blue Dragon Record within the next few days.

“What are you looking at? My disciple possesses the natal saint physique, and her future achievements might not be any weaker than yours. So just wait and see!” Lil’ Purple said unhappily.

“Sure. Wait for me,” Lin Yun smiled. He left after speaking and headed to the Celestial Purging Mountain. Before he activated his medal, a celestial crane flew down. It was the Crane Fairy.

The Crane Fairy coiled around Lin Yun and turned into her humanoid form. She smiled, “Ye Qingtian, you’re finally here. My master has been waiting for you.

“Did you bring me any gifts?” The Crane Fairy asked. “I heard you won first place in the Sword Assembly.”

Lin Yun immediately felt embarrassed because he didn’t bring any gifts for her. But when she mentioned the Sword Assembly, he smiled, “My Heavenly Dipper Sword is still on the way, and it’s a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact. I’ll get someone to deliver it to you at that time.”

“Are you serious about that? I’ll remember what you said!” The Crane Fairy rejoiced.

“Yeah, I’m serious,” Lin Yun smiled. He wasn’t stingy since the Crane Fairy helped him multiple times, not to mention it was also tiring for her to carry him.

“Hehe, let’s go. I’ll bring you to see my master.” The Crane Fairy was happy as she returned to her crane form, allowing Lin Yun to get on her back before they soared to the sky. When they arrived at the ninth level, Tian Xing awaited them.

“Greetings, Senior.” Lin Yun stepped forth and bowed, showing his respect for this elder. Without his help, Lin Yun wouldn’t have been able to grasp the Astral Sword Intent so easily, and his life would have also been in danger.

Sometimes, one would only need to take a step after having sufficient insight. Otherwise, they would be trapped at the bottleneck for a long time, and what Tian Xing said earlier was that insight for him. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“You saw the Blue Dragon Record?” Tian Xing pointed to the northwest, where the blue pillar of light could still be seen.

“I have.” Lin Yun nodded.

“What do you feel about it?”

“Shocking. But I can’t see anything else since it’s too far away,” Lin Yun said. He didn’t know what to say apart from feeling shocked, not to mention receiving any insights.

“The spiritual energy and saint dao are being transformed there, and this change will sweep through the entire Kunlun Realm. All lives within the Kunlun Realm will benefit from it,” Tian Xing said. “After that, the Golden Era will arrive. The density of spiritual energy will increase, and it will also be easier to comprehend dao. Countless geniuses will emerge, bringing this era to a whole new height. The Golden Era from ancient times might reappear.

“Does the Blue Dragon Record have that huge of an effect?” Lin Yun asked.

“The Blue Dragon Record is a divine artifact of the era, but it can’t change how the world works. The heavenly dao started to make a change after sensing a certain danger, and the Blue Dragon Record is the key to that door,” Tian Xing explained.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because this was beyond his reach and didn’t quite understand it.

“People say each prosperous age will be followed with great chaos. There will be internal and external threats, which is a grand era. I just hate that I couldn’t be born three thousand years later,” Tian Xing sighed. He envied this era. He lived in the era that was the end of the dark age, and the Nine Emperors were so dazzling and trampled on all the geniuses in the world. If he could live again, he would rather live in the current era.

“Why is such a divine artifact in the hands of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“Don’t belittle the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. It’s mysterious, and no one can find it without guidance. Even the legendary eight emperor clans aren’t as mysterious as the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. This force in the Divine Dragon Era won’t come in contact with karma,” Tian Xing smiled.

Lin Yun was astonished. He didn’t expect the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain to have such a huge origin that even a former Sword Emperor like Tian Xing would hold the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain in such a high position.

Ripples spread out within his heart. If he had agreed with Mu Lingxue and went to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain, would he have become even stronger than he was now?

“So it is best that the Blue Dragon Record is in the hands of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. If someone else controls it, they might have ulterior thoughts,” Tian Xing explained. “Furthermore, I’ve heard that the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain only accepted it after receiving a request from the Blue Dragon Ancestor God, which means that the Blue Dragon Ancestor God owed a favor to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain.”

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that and said, “It looks like they’re a big deal, then. I have to visit them, if I have time.”

“You’re here wanting to bring your Astral Sword Intent to the pinnacle of complete mastery, right?” Tian Xing smiled, sensing the current level of Lin Yun’s sword intent.

Lin Yun nodded, “Yeah, but I’m not in a hurry. I still have other questions related to sword intent.”

“Go on.” Tian Xing was calm and gentle.

“Is there a way to face saint dao head-on with sword intent?” Lin Yun asked. He still hadn’t forgotten the battle with Zhao Tianyu in that cave. The latter easily tore apart his Astral Sword Intent by empowering his Divine Lightning Eyes with lightning dao.

Once the Blue Dragon Record appears, if he’d wanted to compete with the other holy lands, there’s a possibility that he might face Sovereign Daos. So he naturally had to prepare for that since he hadn’t reached the Quasi-Saint Realm.

Tian Xing smiled, “Only you?would ask such a question. Who in their right mind wants to face saint dao head-on while at the Nirvana Stage? Not only is your sword intent capable of facing saint aura, but you even want to face saint dao. You’re too greedy.”

Lin Yun awkwardly coughed, and said, “Senior, do you have a solution?”

Tian Xing smiled, “The simplest method is naturally to grasp saint dao and empower sword intent with saint dao. There are other methods, but they would be ineffective if you run into a powerful opponent and the two aren’t on the same level.”

Lin Yun understood that it was similar to what his senior brother said about saint dao being an amplifier. It would shatter like walking on thin ice if the opponent was too powerful.

“It’s practically impossible to block it. But if you can reach the pinnacle of complete mastery with your Astral Sword Intent, you can ensure that even saint dao cannot shatter your sword intent like this fire,” Tian Xing reached out, and a wisp of flame appeared in his palm. “As long as the seed exists, it can reignite even if the fire is extinguished.”

The extinguished fire blazed violently like a ball of fire. This immediately made Lin Yun’s eyes light up as his thoughts rapidly progressed. He soon thought of a possibility, and if he could achieve that level, his sword intent wouldn’t dissipate when facing Zhao Tianyu again.

“Senior, please teach me!” Lin Yun cupped his fists together with a grave expression. He had always been down-to-earth and wouldn’t hesitate to seek help when required.

“This is nothing special since Ye Guhan also knows about it, and he’ll teach you as long as you ask him about it,” Tian Xing smiled.

Lin Yun nodded, “Indeed, but only you?can help me grasp it within seven days and let my Astral Sword Intent reach pinnacle mastery.”

“Hahaha!” Tian Xing laughed heartily when he heard that.

The Crane Fairy also smiled as she watched this scene. Ye Qingtian really knew how to talk, and it was no wonder her master liked him so much. Her master hadn’t laughed so happily for a long time, and it would be nice if Ye Qingtian came more often.

With a smile still on his face, Tian Xing looked at Lin Yun, “Since you’ve said it, won’t I fall to Ye Guhan’s level if I can’t help you grasp it within seven days?”

Lin Yun smiled awkwardly because Tian Xing saw through his thoughts.

“Alright then!” Tian Xing smiled. “I can’t live again, so experience this Golden Era on my behalf!”
