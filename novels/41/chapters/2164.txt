Chapter 2165: Farewell

Lin Yun was still calm after hearing what Mu Xueling said, but Lil’ Purple, who was in the Iris Secret Realm, became emotional. She excitedly said, “Hehe. Your old flame is rather reliable. The Heavenly Dragon’s blood was rare even in ancient times, and you’ve won a lottery this time.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“What are you talking about?” Lin Yun was speechless upon hearing that.

“Hehe, why aren’t you thanking her?” Lil’ Purple smiled.

Lin Yun was in no mood to deal with Lil’ Purple now, but he smiled, “Thank you, Saint Elder.”

Mu Xueling was calm as she said, “The Heavenly Dragon’s blood has to be nourished for some time, so I’ll give it to you in the future.”

“Thank you,” Lin Yun said.

Mu Xueling could give it to him now, but there was too much attention on the Heavenly Dragon’s blood, and giving it to him now would spell trouble. This was why she said that she would give it to him in the future, not giving anyone the opportunity to make a move against him.

Zi Ling’s face was ugly from Lin Yun’s reply. Lin Yun naturally noticed that, but he didn’t take it to heart.

After Mu Xueling looked at Lin Yun and the nine dragon lords, the Blue Dragon Record had come to an end. Each of the rewards given was a treasure that could nurture a top-tiered expert. Everyone here was a genius, and with all the treasures added together, it wouldn’t be long for the seven divine dragon lords to rise quickly.

“The Blue Dragon Record has come to an end here, but this is only the beginning. It can be considered a banquet for all Quasi-Saints, and the banquet for Saints will unlock the Blue Dragon Vault. I hope to see all your names on the ranking at that time, with everyone reaching the Saint Realm.” Mu Xueling said in a solemn tone.

“It has come to an end here? I still haven't had enough of it.”

“I heard that the Blue Dragon Vault was left behind by that Ancestral Deity, so it’s a pity that it’s not opened this time.”

“It’s really a pity. It’s already so grand when everyone participating is a Quasi-Saint. I can’t imagine how glorious it will become when it’s for Saints.”

“Hehe, that’s right. This is only the beginning of a prosperous era.”

“I can’t imagine the future achievements of the nine dragon lords, especially the divine dragon lords. They will surely have a spot in that prosperous era.”

“It’s a pity that Ye Qingtian actually refused.” The Blue Dragon Record had come to an end, and the event was exciting for everyone. There was no question that Ye Qingtian stole the limelight in this event. No one expected that a prodigy swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect would obtain the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title with so many experts around.

When the Blue Dragon Record spreads out, his name would be ranked first, and everyone in the Kunlun Realm would know of his name at that time. But everyone was more surprised because Ye Qingtian refused the offer to become the Empress’ disciple. Not only did he refuse, but he wanted the rewards without feeling ashamed about it.

Many people felt that Ye Qingtian wouldn’t have any outcome after offending the Empress. He was too arrogant, and he might fall before he could reach the Saint Realm. Even if the event had come to an end, the discussion revolving around Ye Qingtian hadn’t stopped. Even those from the Heavenly Dao Sect felt that it was incredible that Ye Qingtian refused the offer to become the Empress’ disciple.

Even the Thousand Plume Great Saint was dumbfounded as he said, “What the hell? Is the disciple of the Dragon Origin Great Saint that stubborn?”

Those with a high position knew how terrifying the Empress was. From their point of view, it was naturally a good thing that Ye Qingtian didn’t agree to it. But even if Ye Qingtian agreed to it, there was nothing the Dragon Origin Great Saint could say about it, and it might not necessarily be bad news for the Heavenly Dao Sect. After all, the Empress would owe the Heavenly Dao Sect one if she took Ye Qingtian as her disciple.

Gu Xiyan jumped off the Dragon Mountain and came before Lin Yun. He called out, “Ye Qingtian!”

“What’s the matter?” Lin Yun asked.

“I owe you one. Also, I’m sorry because of what I said earlier when I felt that you’re comparing yourself with Flower Burial.” Gu Xiyan was a straightforward person and was genuinely unhappy after thinking that Ye Qingtian was trying to compare himself with Flower Burial.

Now that he knew of Ye Qingtian’s talent in the sword, he came over to apologize to him.

“It’s nothing. I was teasing you on purpose,” Lin Yun smiled with a playful expression.

“What?” Gu Xiyan was baffled.

“Speaking of which, have you seen Flower Burial before? Why are you so concerned about him? You admire him so much, but have you thought of the possibility that he doesn’t even know you?” Lin Yun asked curiously. He was genuinely curious about that because Gu Xiyan seemed to be especially concerned with Flower Burial’s name, more concerned than Lin Yun himself. This was why he wanted to joke around with Gu Xiyan earlier.

Gu Xiyan said, “I have not seen him before, but he has the highest reputation amongst the Champions of the Heavenly Paths. It’s only proper to give respect to those who are strong, and I don’t need him to know about it. We came from the lesser realms, so we naturally have to protect this glory together. You don’t know how hard it was to kill your way out of the Heavenly Paths, nor how hard it was for us after arriving in the Kunlun Realm. None of us dare to relax, and it’s not that easy for us, unlike what the outside world thinks.”

The outside world had a misunderstanding about the Champions of the Heavenly Paths, thinking that they were accompanied by great fortune to arrive in the Kunlun realm and that they would rise even if they did nothing. But in reality, only they knew how tough it was for them.

Lin Yun knew that they probably had the same experience as him. He looked at Gu Xiyan, and said, “What if I told you… that I also know about it?”

“No, you don’t.” Gu Xiyan smiled.

Lin Yun opened his mouth and smiled bitterly. Gu Xiyan was really stubborn. The latter was handsome and had a monstrous talent, but he didn't look very smart. Lin Yun had already given a blatant hint, and yet Gu Xiyan still couldn’t comprehend it.

“Those who haven’t experienced it before won’t know about it, but Flower Burial will since he has experienced it before.” Gu Xiyan said seriously with a reminiscence on his face.

“Alright. The world is huge, but we will meet again in the future,” Lin Yun no longer argued about it.

“I owe you one, and the Blue Dragon Bone will help me greatly. Thanks a lot,” Gu Xiyan said seriously. He was already disheartened and was prepared to leave the Dragon Mountain after being defeated, but Ye Qingtian didn’t hold it against him and sent him to the Blue Dragon Throne instead. If Ye Qingtian didn’t help him, he might not have been able to receive the rewards, so he owed Ye Qingtian a great one.

“No need to thank me. The Blue Dragon Throne was yours, to begin with. I’ll be taking my leave now,” Lin Yun casually said as he waved his hand and left.

Looking at Ye Qingtian’s back, he had envy in his eyes because he couldn’t imitate Ye Qingtian’s mentality or his carefree manner. He muttered, “As expected of the Holy Maiden Killer.”

As Lin Yun slowly walked, he looked up and his gaze fell onto Ye Ziling.

“Senior Sister, I’ll leave the Sword Sect to you.”

“Don’t worry about it.” They looked at each other and became silent. This was because there was no need for them to talk much due to their rapport as fellow disciples.

“Congratulations to the young master on becoming the Heavenly Dragon Lord.” An Liyuan transmitted her voice to Lin Yun.

“How have you been?” Lin Yun asked with concern.

“Hehe. I’m fine. Your friends have been taking good care of me,” An Liuyan said.

Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan? Lin Yun inwardly muttered because those two must have been arranged by Su Ziyao since there was no way he could give orders to them.

An Liuyan said, “I’m already off the mountain, so you don’t have to worry about me. I will take good care of myself.”

She knew that Lin Yun still had many people to meet, and she didn’t want to cause any trouble for him.

Lin Yun nodded. But just when he was about to leave, a voice passed into his ears, “I will wait for you at the God Burial Mountain Range’s Soarstream Peak.”

Lin Yun was briefly startled since it was Su Ziyao’s voice, but he couldn’t find her anywhere when he raised his head.

“Ye Qingtian!” Just when he was briefly stunned, the Dao Yang Holy Son came over with the other saint disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect, alongside Ji Zixi, Xin Yan, and Bai Shuying. The Dao Yang Holy Son said in a complaining and joking tone, “You’ve really hidden so much from us, obtaining the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title without causing a commotion.”

“I was just lucky. Senior Brother isn’t bad after becoming the Azure Dragon Lord,” Lin Yun replied.

“You really know how to speak. Even if I fought Gu Xiyan, I would only have 30% odds of winning because my Great Sun Saint Physique is weaker in comparison. Here, you can have this,” Dao Yang Holy Son smiled as he handed the Azure Dragon Bone to Lin Yun. “You can keep it. I don’t have much use for this Azure Dragon Bone, so you can use it since you practice the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.”

“There’s no need. I can pick a divine dragon bone that I like,” Lin Yun rejected.

“Ye Qingtian, I’ve realized that you’re pretty adorable. You’re actually still thinking about the rewards now?” Ji Zixi laughed.

“Saint Elder already promised me, and I believe the Empress won’t refuse it,” Lin Yun replied.

Ji Zixi smiled, “The Empress naturally won’t go back on her words, but who knows if they will give it to you within a year or ten years. How long do you think it will take for your rewards to arrive?”

“I’m guessing a month or half a year. Why don’t you make a bet with me?” Lin Yun smiled.

Ji Zixi wanted to take the bet, but she became silent as her face flushed after recalling that she had just lost a bet not too long ago.

“Senior Brother, you can keep it because I really don’t need it. But I’m grateful for it,” Lin Yun said, looking at the Dao Yang Holy Son.

“Alright. But since you became the Heavenly Dragon Lord, the sect will definitely reward you for it. So don’t refuse it at that time,” Dao Yang Holy Son smiled.

“Sure,” Lin Yun smiled since he had no reason to refuse the offer.

Everyone was bidding farewell to each other outside the Dragon Mountain. Everyone gathered because of the Blue Dragon Record, and they would have to say farewell to each other now.

The Kunlun Realm was massive, and they might not see each other again even in a hundred years. Ji Zixi also bade her farewell to everyone and invited everyone to the Divine Phoenix Mountain. The Divine Phoenix Mountain had a long inheritance, and it was said that there was something special about the Divine Phoenix Mountain. But only the Ji Clan and guests invited by them could take a glimpse of it.

“Little Princess, don’t forget what you promised me,” Lin Yun said.

“I won’t forget about it, but don’t forget to come to the Divine Phoenix Mountain as well,” Ji Zixi smiled. In the end, she even secretly transmitted her voice into Lin Yun’s ears, “I still want to listen to the Phoenix Heart Song, and I believe that Flower Burial won’t refuse me, right?”

“Sure,” Lin Yun nodded.

“That’s a promise, then!” Ji Zixi winked and waved her hand at everyone.

The Dao Yang Holy Son said, “Ye Qingtian, you’re really impressive. She will lose it if anyone dares to address her as ‘Little Princess,’ but she didn’t lose it when you called her that.”

Lin Yun merely smiled and said nothing about it.

“Right, where’s the Soarstream Peak?” Lin Yun asked. After getting an answer from the Dao Yang Holy Son, he bade his farewell. Everyone knew that he probably had something else to do, so they didn’t ask him where he was going.
