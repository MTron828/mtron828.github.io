Chapter 1000 - Azure Dragon Saint Armour

Before the test, no one would have considered Yu Haotian to be equal to Lin Yun. However, the strength that Yu Haotian displayed was shocking. Additionally, the crowd knew that the tail inheritance of the Azure Dragon couldn’t be underestimated.

So they began to wonder how ferocious the battle between Lin Yun and Yu Haotian would be. After all, everyone knew that there was a feud between them and that Yu Haotian’s emotion would change drastically the moment Lin Yun’s name was mentioned.

Now, Lin Yun had finally come back, bringing the opportunity above fortune along with him. But no one dared to utter a word as they looked at Lin Yun and Yu Haotian. When Lin Yun arrived, Yu Haotian shifted his gaze from Pei Xue to Lin Yun. After all, he had suffered too much in Lin Yun’s hands.

How could he not be excited with revenge right around the corner? If he could kill someone with his gaze, Lin Yun would have died by now. Yu Haotian’s face was cold as he said, “I’ve been waiting for you for a long time. I’m glad you didn’t die, that would have been boring. After all, I’m going to make you kneel before me!”

“Based on what? Yourself?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly.

“Lin Yun, be careful. He has a transcendent dao artifact, the Divine Shadow Glove. He also digested his inheritance!” Pei Xue’s voice sounded out right at this moment to warn Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun heard that, he knew why Luo Chen and everyone else was in such a terrible state. He even knew why Yu Haotian no longer cared about hiding his killing intent. So it turns out that he had a great fortune and managed to digest all the inheritance. After all, the inheritances were strong and weren’t easily digested.

“Looks like you’re pretty concerned about this little lover of yours.” Yu Haotian smiled and his face gradually became sinister, “But it’s futile. Lin Yun, your only outcome is death!”

His eyes were filled with great confidence as a silver moonlight emitted from his body. When the moonlight reached its limit, the flames blazing on his glove became even more terrifying. “Lin Yun, today is the day you die! No one will save you this time. I’m going to repay the humiliation you gave me and I’ll take all of your opportunities. I’m going to turn all the people you love into slaves and then I’ll kill them!”

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. Yu Haotian had challenged him time and time again so it was about time he got rid of the former.

“It’s time for you to die! You have no idea how strong I’ve become!” A silver winged human appeared behind Yu Haotian as his eyes flashed coldly. When he spread his hand apart, a silver moon bloomed as he executed the Divine Glorymoon Fist.

Suddenly, the silver moonlight gradually started to turn black. Disregarding the pain in his chest, Yu Haotian combined the power of his Divine Shadow Fist and Divine Glorymoon Fist together. In the next second, the silver moon had manifested a black demonic moon. The silver winged human also became pitch black as a terrifying black beam shot into the sky.

“That’s the Ancient Jairus Demonic Soul’s aura!”

“He actually combined the Jairus Demonic Soul and the Divine Glorymoon Fist together! That’s an ancient demonic moon!” Exclamations came from the surroundings because no one had expected that Yu Haotian was still holding back. No wonder Yu Haotian was so arrogant.

It didn’t matter if it was the Divine Shadow Glove or Divine Glorymoon Fist, either one could sweep through the Azure Dragon Region. Even Luo Chen, who struggled to get back up, had fear and concern in his eyes, “This is bad…”

Clenching his fist and grabbing the demonic moon, boundless black demonic radiance came from Yu Haotian’s fist. His face was sinister as power started to swell. Yu Haotian was secretly shocked when he sensed the power of his fist.

“This is troublesome…” Pei Xue’s figure flashed as she took Luo Chen and the others far away. She couldn’t imagine what kind of hatred Yu Haotian had to push the Divine Shadow Glove to such a level. She also couldn’t imagine that such a ruthless person came from the Profound Amber Realm.

When Yu Haotian’s fist descended towards Lin Yun, everyone could sense the immense pressure crashing down. But to everyone’s surprise, Lin Yun didn’t have any origin energy fluctuations. Instead, he formed an ancient seal while the divine rune on the Azure Dragon True Bone shined brightly. Then, he added in the nine dragon runes to unleash his boundless dragon aura and azure dragon.

“Azure Dragon Saint Armor!” Lin Yun roared as his radiance turned into armor. When the armor appeared, everyone could sense the terrifying aura coming from Lin Yun that gave a sacred pressure.

“It’s dragon armor? What a realistic azure dragon aura…” Everyone’s faces changed when they saw the armor. Clearly, it was something he obtained from his inheritance. However, the crowd was still nervous for Lin Yun.

Yu Haotian’s fist caused the entire heaven and earth to tremble violently as a powerful ripple fluctuated out and manifested into a black tornado. The plaza began to crack while the stages were tossed around.

Even with the surrounding chaos, the crowd eagerly watched the fight. After Yu Haotian threw one punch, he retreated and stared at the stage full of demonic light and dragon aura.

A long time later, the light dissipated to reveal a figure standing still. All of a sudden, Yu Haotian’s heart sank. As the demonic light gradually faded, Lin Yun appeared with his Azure Dragon Saint Amour untouched. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“He blocked it!” An uproar burst out on the plaza. Even Yu Haotian had disbelief on his face before he charged forward once more. However, his attacks could only leave little ripples on Lin Yun’s armor. In the blink of an eye, he unleashed a barrage of ten punches. Despite the attacks, Lin Yun stood firm.

“Is this all you got?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly with killing intent surging in his pupils. Yu Haotian had no idea what Lin Yun went through. Lin Yun had experienced an unprecedented tribulation on the blood ocean with ten Demonic Astral Flames accompanying each lightning bolt. It was a pain that Yu Haotian couldn’t imagine. So how could his Azure Dragon Saint Armor be destroyed by a mere glove?

Finally, Lin Yun made a move and threw out a punch. His punch sent Yu Haotian flying while spitting up blood.

“This is just the beginning!” Lin Yun appeared before Yu Haotian and continued throwing out punches with dazzling golden brilliance.

Clouds Dispelling Sun, Eastern Purple Aura, Rising Flames!

After Lin Yun threw out three punches, three seals appeared behind his golden winged human. Then, the three seals combined to form the secret technique, Divine Sun Annihilation!

The golden winged human unfolded its wings and each of its feathers shined bright. The golden brilliance soon became the only source of light in the world. As light and dark coexisted, the Divine Sun Annihilation had reached an unprecedented height since it was empowered by the Azure Dragon True Bone. Cracks sounded out from Yu Haotian as he was blown away. Under everyone’s shocked gaze, Yu Haotian fell to the ground.
