Chapter 2097 - A Deadline of One Month

Lin Yun and Wang Muyan came to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda while they were chatting. Neither of them mentioned what happened during that thunderstorm night, acting as though it never happened.

The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was nine hundred feet high, erected on a mountain. Compared to the majestic mountains surrounding it, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was rather low-profile and didn’t look special. But it was a time and space treasure, so there should be something special inside.

After the two proved their identities, they met the elder responsible for guarding the first level, the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord. The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord was plainly dressed, appearing to be in his forties. He didn’t give off any majestic aura, and looked easy-going. No one would believe that he was a noble Saint Realm expert when judging from his appearance.

The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun and Wang Muyan before he smiled, “Why did the two of you come now with your talent and status?”

Both Lin Yun and Wang Muyan had their secrets, so they simply said a few words as a polite response.

The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord didn’t pursue it, but continued, “I’ll give you two a brief introduction. The first level of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda contains the martial techniques that have been collected by the sect, the second level is where the pill and alchemy chambers are located, and the third level contains all kinds of rare and exotic demonic beast materials. The first three floors are similar to the Contribution Hall, but the quality of the things here is higher.

“The Temporal Realm starts from the third floor, and all the saint disciples are practically here for it. The Temporal Realm has three levels. The higher the level, the more abundant the spiritual energy; you can even find saint elixirs there. Great Saint’s disciples are only allowed to go to the fourth level. The fifth and sixth levels are for holy sons and holy maidens. Ye Qingtian, you know about that, right?”

Lin Yun nodded. It was more or less the same as what the Dao Yang Holy Son said.

The resources that holy sons and holy maidens could receive were on a whole different level to Great Saint’s disciples. For example, the density of spiritual energy was different at the different levels, and the cultivation speed would also differ. The fifth and sixth levels even had the Ancient Myriad Lightning Pool, Divine Heavenly Flame Cauldron, Sword Pavilion, and other similar grounds.

No matter what greater dao you practiced, you could find a place suitable to you, and it was so mysterious that ordinary people couldn’t imagine it.

“Let him come with me. He can accompany me in my cultivation,” Wang Muyan smiled.

Lin Yun was surprised when he heard that and didn’t believe that Wang Muyan could accomplish that.

But the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord briefly hesitated before he turned to Lin Yun. He smiled, “Ye Qingtian, what do you think?”

Lin Yun was stunned when he heard that and saw a bright smile on Wang Muyan’s face. He then replied, “No thanks.”

He had already stayed in a similar realm for ten-odd years, so it was best for him not to enter any similar realms before reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm. Otherwise, his foundation would be affected once the age of his physique was finalized.

“Heavenly Yi Saint Lord, I’m here to look for some books related to sword dao, and I don’t intend to go to the Temporal Realm now,” Lin Yun said.

“I see…” The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord gave Lin Yun a jade plaque, then said, “Go and find it yourself. But you can’t bring anything from the inside out and don’t need to use contribution points to exchange for them. If you manage to learn them, you will be rewarded.”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up upon hearing that. He headed straight to the first level after bidding farewell to the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord.

This place was filled with bookshelves, and there were various introductions to various martial techniques. Lin Yun came to the sword dao section. Since he had a photographic memory, he quickly flipped through the books. The martial techniques that could be placed here were at least ghost spirit martial techniques, and each book was highly valuable, since they were all top-tiered martial techniques.

Low and mid-grade ghost spirit martial techniques weren’t even qualified to be placed here. This naturally amazed Lin Yun about the foundation of a holy land. There was no way the Sword Sect could be compared to the foundation of the Heavenly Dao Sect. But Lin Yun was even more shocked that ghost spirit martial techniques only accounted for one-tenth of the books here, and the rest were dragon spirit martial techniques.

But it was a pity that most were incomplete. The books were very straightforward, and even if he managed to exchange a complete version of the jade slip, the martial technique recorded in it wasn’t complete. This was because those ghost spirit martial techniques were incomplete when they were found. Even so, those dragon spirit martial techniques were extremely valuable, and if one could practice one or even half a move, it was enough to surpass ghost spirit martial techniques.

They’re not complete, and it’s tough to complete them. But I can treat them as ultimate moves. Lin Yun pondered to himself. He memorized the incomplete sword techniques that interested him before he carried on flipping through the books because he had to find a way to cultivate his dual sword stars. Specifically, he needed a way to maximize the power of his dual sword stars.

But he couldn’t find it even after flipping through the books for a long time. When he raised his head, he noticed that this entire level was massive, and it would take him a few days to flip through all the books here, even with his photographic memory.

Many ancient records were incomplete, and even the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord might not be able to understand them. Several areas were at the back, and Lin Yun could see a pile of ancient books piled together like garbage. There were so many books that it was practically impossible for him to sort them out. Thus, the Heavenly Dao Sect merely threw them together in a corner. If Lin Yun couldn’t find the book he needed here, he would have to go through the pile of ‘garbage’ over there.

“How luxurious,” Lin Yun sighed.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What’s luxurious about it? You’ve obtained so many incomplete jade slips at the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and even the Sword Sect can’t sort them out entirely. Many jade slips don’t even have a name. So be satisfied about it,” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the Iris Secret Realm.

Lin Yun could only bitterly smile upon hearing that before he continued his search. This was a boring process, but he didn’t have any other way.

“Are you looking for this?” Wang Muyan came over with an ancient book while Lin Yun was flipping through the books. She was showing off her voluptuous figure as she walked over.

Lin Yun was curious as to why she didn’t enter the Temporal Realm, but he asked, “What’s that?”

“The Divine Solar Lunar Art,” Wang Muyan smiled as she handed the book over.

Lin Yun quickly took the book over and began flipping through it.

“The Divine Solar Lunar Art is an incomplete dragon spirit martial technique. It was an ancient divine technique consisting fist, palm, movement, sword, and various secret techniques. This was obtained by a Saint Elder of the sect on an ancient cauldron in a forbidden ground. The cauldron was called the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron Cauldron, a sacred artifact of an ancient sect that can even kill deities…” The more Lin Yun read the book, the more he found it familiar before he recalled the Divine Solar Lunar Fist that he had obtained on the Ninth Heavenly Path.

The third move of the fist technique was called the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron. So when he read through the introduction, he finally realized that the cauldron did exist. He felt that this ancient book might contain something related to his dual sword stars.

“Where did you find it?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

Wang Muyan smiled, “I found it in the fist technique corner. These books are incomplete, and the sect naturally can’t carefully sort them out. But you must be curious as to why I know you’re looking for this book.”

“Why?” Lin Yun asked after a brief stun.

Wang Muyan smiled, “Ye Qingtian, you’re really stupid. It’s because I have you in my heart.”

“Perhaps you’re just sweet-talking,” Lin Yun smiled. He was calm and maintained his distance from Wang Muyan. If he didn’t appear that day, Bai Xiao might have lost his life. He could tell how terrifying Wang Muyan was, especially when her murderous intent was aroused.

Wang Muyan smiled, “I didn’t even go to the Temporal Realm because of you and personally looked for this book for you. Dual sword stars are too rare, and finding a cultivation method is hard. It’s rare for anyone to create a sword technique for dual sword stars, and such secret techniques are rare. Even if they’re created, finding an inheritance is hard.”

What she said wasn’t wrong because dual sword stars were rare, and the second one might take a few thousand years to appear. Thus, most inheritances were buried through time.

“So the next best thing is the sun and moon, also one of the thirty-six sovereign daos. Cultivation techniques consisting of them are obscure and difficult to understand, and they’re a top-tiered inheritance of a holy land, without a doubt,” Wang Muyan said. “So why don’t you settle with the Divine Solar Lunar Art? There might be some secret techniques useful to you. Otherwise, you can only use your dual sword stars to empower your sword intent, which would waste your talent.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts as he closed up the book. He looked at Wang Muyan and asked, “You seem to understand me better than I understand myself.”

“I can’t guarantee that, but I can help you more than you think. Since we can’t cultivate together in the Temporal Realm, we can practice this secret technique together. Also, why don’t we make a bet and see who cultivates faster?” Wang Muyan smiled.

“What are we betting on?”

“If I win, you’ll undo the Nether Shackles on me. If I lose, I’ll leave the Heavenly Dao Sect and even tell you the true objective of the divine cult,” Wang Muyan winked.

“That’s a high stake. Don’t tell me you’ve planned this in advance?” Lin Yun came to his senses and became a little suspicious, wondering if Wang Muyan made this bet on purpose and was waiting for him.

Wang Muyan leaned over. When her face was only two inches from Lin Yun, she asked, “What’s the matter? You’re afraid?”

Lin Yun pushed Wang Muyan away and fell into deep thought. The bet was attractive to him and Wang Muyan leaving the Heavenly Dao Sect would eliminate one of his worries. No matter what the Blood Moon Sect was planning, it wouldn't be that terrifying since Wang Muyan wasn’t around.

“Don’t tell me the famous Flower Burial is afraid? Didn’t you claim to be the strongest swordsman in the past and the next five hundred years?” Wang Muyan smiled.

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t fall for her provocation. He replied, “You’re a demoness in the past and the next five hundred years.”

“Big Sister will treat that as a compliment. Let’s stop beating around the bush. Just tell me if you’ll take the bet,” Wang Muyan smiled.

She spoke in a tone with a mixture of joking, provocation, and resentment.

Lin Yun took a deep breath because Wang Muyan was really ruthless. After all, how could a man say no? In the worst scenario, he only had to undo her Nether Shackles. Since he could place the seal on her once, he could naturally do it again.

Not to mention Lin Yun didn’t want to lose. He asked, “How long is the deadline?”

The corner of Wang Muyan’s lips rose into a charming smile. She replied, “One month.”

“A deadline of one month. Don’t regret your bet,” Lin Yun said.

Wang Muyan didn’t seem bothered, and she smiled, “I’ve lost a bet with an even bigger stake before, so how can I be bothered with a bet as small as this? I only have love and have no hatred for you, not to mention I won’t regret my decision.”

Lin Yun and Wang Muyan came to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda while they were chatting. Neither of them mentioned what happened during that thunderstorm night, acting as though it never happened.
