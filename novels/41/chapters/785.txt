Chapter 786 - Who Worries For Me?

Lin Yun’s act of boldness without any hesitation left many people shocked. He could’ve avoided this fight because it had no bearing on his chances of making it into the next round. No one thought that Lin Yun had a high chance of winning. Even worse, he would have to reveal many of his trump cards. This might affect his final ranking in the end because the other participants would be cautious against his trump cards.

He didn’t concede? Everyone shared the same thought at this moment. The geniuses who viewed Lin Yun as an opponent smiled because Lin Yun would have to reveal a lot of his trump card in this battle. This would make it easier for them if they ran into Lin Yun in the ranking battle. They might not even need to face him if he were to be crippled by Ji Feng.

“Haha, a piece of trash really thinks he can challenge the top ten?” Yan Long’zi glanced at Lin Yun and started sneering before turning to those beside him, “You guys should watch closely. This brat will probably be crippled. Ji Feng and Jue Chen’s fight was polite since they are both in the top ten. They won’t fight that way for those that are beneath them.”

He purposely spoke in a loud voice so that Yue Weiwei could hear it. This made Yue Weiwei’s face turn cold as she looked at Yan Long’zi. In that split second, everyone from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion could sense Yue Weiwei’s killing intent. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Yue Weiwei barked, “Yan Long’zi, can you shut the hell up? You’re nothing but a clown in my eyes. Don’t provoke me or you’ll regret it.”

Her words instantly caused the entire Heavenly Demon Pavilion to become silent as no one expected that Yue Weiwei would be so ruthless with her words. Yan Long’zi was one of the three kings, but Yue Weiwei actually berated him publicly.

The disciples and elders of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion were dumbfounded. No one had expected that Yue Weiwei, who usually seemed so charming and bewitching, would be so terrifying when she became enraged. Her tone made no one doubt that she could really do what she said.

Yan Long’zi’s face alternated between red and white as he had never been so humiliated before. He couldn’t keep his gentlemanly persona any longer and retorted coldly, “Am I wrong? That brat is a piece of trash. He’s going to get beaten up by Ji Feng.”

“Looks like you’re really courting death!” Yue Weiwei’s eyes were filled with boundless killing intent as her hair started to flutter in the wind.

Yan Long’zi’s heart sank for some reason and his face changed.

“Apologize to your junior sister.” Just when Yan Long’zi’s temper was about to flare up, the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s Pavilion Master barked at him. At this moment, Yan Long’zi felt death looming upon him.

He didn’t doubt that the pavilion master would really kill him if he refused to apologize. This made him extremely shocked as he began to wonder about Yue Weiwei’s origin. After all, he was an important chess piece of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion in this banquet. He was truly shocked that the pavilion master would kill him for Yue Weiwei.

“I’m sorry about what I said.” Yan Long’zi could only apologize despite how enraged he felt. He had to suppress the rage in his heart or there would be consequences.

“That better be the last time you say something.” Yue Weiwei snorted and ignored him.

Damn it! Yan Long’zi’s pupils flashed with hatred and rage, but he quickly concealed it. After all, he still couldn’t turn against the Heavenly Demon Pavilion or the pavilion master.

This commotion also caused everyone in the surroundings to be shocked. However, the banquet proceeded as normal. Everyone was eager to see how Lin Yun would embarrass himself.

After all, there was no lack of people who were jealous of him and wanted to see him fail. Even those supporting Lin Yun became nervous because they didn’t think he could win.

Ji Feng glanced at Lin Yun coldly before he said in disdain, “Do you think having a winning streak will change my mind about you? Do you think I’ll propose a one move match with you?”

Ji Feng was naturally unhappy as most geniuses and dark horses admitted defeat to the three kings and seven elites. Lin Yun was the only exception. Is Lin Yun looking down on me because I’m ranked number ten?

But Ji Feng immediately suppressed his thoughts. Since Lin Yun dared to get on the stage, he might as well cripple Lin Yun. After all, he wouldn’t allow anyone to look down on him.

“Sorry, but I don’t have any thoughts of settling this in one move with you. I want to defeat you openly,” replied Lin Yun. Who said that the three kings and seven elites couldn’t be defeated?

But the moment Lin Yun said that, his words caused a commotion among the crowd. The spectators felt that Lin Yun was too arrogant. There hadn’t been a newly risen genius who dared to speak to the top ten in this manner before. Even the three kings and seven elites wouldn’t dare to say such words blatantly.

Lin Yun’s words also caused the remaining top ten to look at him peculiarly. Even Yu Haotian couldn’t help wearing a playful gaze as if he was looking at a clown.

Ji Feng was briefly stunned before he smiled, “I’ve changed my mind. Let me play with you for a bit.”

His smile was terrifyingly cold and gave many people chills. At this moment, everyone knew that Ji Feng was thoroughly enraged. Water geysers soared into the sky and Ji Feng made his move.

Unlike others, he would never underestimate his opponent and Lin Yun was no exception. Ji Feng gave it his all the moment he attacked, unleashing his aura in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm while countless sparks began to scatter around the stage.

“Star Smashing Fist!” Ji Feng roared and threw a punch that sparked with power.

Facing Ji Feng’s attack, the Flower Burial Sword buzzed and Lin Yun unleashed his xiantian sword intent at complete mastery. The brilliant sword hum echoed in everyone’s ears.

A wisp of sword aura pierced through the clouds, splitting the thick clouds in two. Just like that, Lin Yun and Ji Feng faced off with their aura as each of them occupied one half of the sky.

“His sword intent is so powerful!” Everyone was shocked. They knew that Lin Yun had hidden his true sword intent, but they never expected that Lin Yun’s sword intent would be this powerful. They could see ripples in the air from the sword intent that wander among the sparks.

“Thunderbolt Slash!” Lin Yun swayed left and right before he split into three images and charged forward. When the sword and fist clashed, both Lin Yun and Ji Feng retreated.

Empowered by his xiantian sword intent in complete mastery, the might of Lin Yun’s Thunderbolt Slash was a lot more powerful than before. Ji Feng was probing Lin Yun, but Lin Yun was also probing Ji Feng. After all, Lin Yun didn’t want to reveal all of his trump cards.

“Solar Slash!” Lin Yun spun in mid-air while two light screens rising on both his sides. As he dashed forward, the light screens moved along with him and distorted space.

“Pitiful tricks.” Ji Feng’s face stayed calm while his eyes radiated brightly as if he could see through everything. In the blink of an eye, he caught Lin Yun’s figure and charged over.

Just like that, Lin Yun and Ji Feng clashed with incredible speed. The fluctuation from their clash was shocking and each attack was like a huge hammer that struck the spectators hearts.

As Yue Weiwei watched from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s seats, she became nervous and clenched her fists. She was filled with emotions, but she couldn’t describe her current feelings. Additionally, her worries were written all over her face because she knew that this battle wouldn’t be easy.
