Chapter 802 - Which Youth Wasn't Arrogant?

Although Yue Weiwei and Qing Ruoyou’s battle had come to an end, the discussion in the surroundings still continued. The battle had far surpassed anyone’s expectation. It was also more shocking than Lin Yun killing Lin Tao.

Qing Ruoyou was the Indigomoon Elysium’s princess with an aloof personality and noble identity. She had countless pursuers in Thunder Prefecture, and everyone from the Thunder Prefecture knew how aloof she was. If she even bothered to glance at anyone, it would be their honor.

Lin Yun had a deep impression of Qing Ruoyou from Skymound City. After all, the seven geniuses came after him even though she didn’t even say a single word. Because of this, he was forced into a dead-end and Lil’ Red even ended up in its current state. When Lin Yun thought about it, Su Ziyao let her off easy with only two slaps.

Yue Weiwei on the other hand was truly brutal. She was willing to let everyone in the Ancient Southern Domain take a look at Qing Ruoyou embarrassing herself.

“This Yue Weiwei is really a demoness. Her methods are too terrifying.”

“She might seem innocent, but she’s really ruthless when she attacks.”

“Yeah, she probably decided to humiliate Qing Ruoyou when the latter scolded her. She put on quite the show by calling Qing Ruoyou her big sister.”

“It’s too late for Qing Ruoyou to regret anything now. Yue Weiwei isn’t a pushover, so don’t be bewitched by her appearance.”

“How can you say that about Yue Weiwei? Didn’t you see how breathtaking Qing Ruoyou’s dance was? Without Yue Weiwei, do you guys think you guys can see her dance? Just a moment ago, all of you were so excited to watch her dance.”

“Hehe, Qing Ruoyou is really charming. Why didn’t I realize this in the past?”

“Haha, lower your voice, don’t let the Indigomoon Elysium hear you. They can easily hear you from where they’re sitting.” There were all sorts of people among the audience. None of the disciples from the major sects dared to say a word, but the wandering cultivators and remote sects didn’t care.

But there was something correct about what was said. The Indigomoon Elysium could hear everyone’s discussion clearly and their facial expressions were nasty. But there was nothing they could do about this matter or it would affect Qing Ruoyou’s reputation greatly.

The nine overlord forces’ disciples sat upright as none of them dared to discuss this matter, especially when they could sense the killing aura coming from Yu Haotian. If there was no surprise, Yu Haotian would surely deal with Yue Weiwei personally. The heated discussion only died down when Bai Lixuan got to the stage.

“Second group, Bai Lixuan VS Yang Lie!” Upon the judge’s announcement, a huge commotion broke out as everyone looked at the second group’s stage. Bai Lixuan’s popularity was still high, unlike Feng Wudao who lost several rounds. At this point, there weren’t many dark horses left at the banquet.

The other dark horse, aside from Lin Yun, was Yue Weiwei who just put on a breathtaking performance. The remaining ones were Zhu Qingshan and Fang Hanluo.

In many people’s eyes, Zhu Qingshan was even stronger than Lin Yun. Up to this point, he killed the most people in this banquet, earning himself the nickname Demon Blade. His popularity wasn’t any lower than Lin Yun’s.

There was also Fang Hanluo, who was a weirdo that used the battles to temper himself, teetering on the edge of life and death. Several of his battles were extremely dangerous because he was basically playing with his own life. But no matter what, Fang Hanluo survived all the battles and grew even stronger. In the beginning, he wasn’t Yang Fan’s opponent, but now, he could fight for the top ten spots.

As for Bai Lixuan, his saint physique had garnered him great fame in the Ancient Southern Domain. Although he lost several fights, it was mostly because his opponents were too strong and admitted defeat. In many people’s view, he was still hiding his trump card. After all, he wasn’t too weak to defeat them.

His talent in the sword might not be comparable to Lin Yun, but his attainment in lightning was terrifyingly shocking. It even got him the title Lightning Sword. Now, he was in a crucial battle because his opponent was Yang Lie who was ranked ninth in the previous banquet.

If Bai Lixuan could win, not only would he obtain the qualification to make it into the top twenty, but his fame would be at the same level of Lin Yun and Zhu Qingshan. Yang Lie was Bai Lixuan’s strongest opponent by far.

Bai Lixuan had no way out of this battle because he had to win. If he didn’t, his profound amber aura would be seized by Yang Lie.

“Four years ago, I lost to your senior sister, Jiang Ziye. I didn’t expect that I would run into you. This banquet is really interesting.” Yang Lie smiled. Everyone could tell that Yang Lie didn’t place Bai Lixuan in his eyes. After all, only the seven elites like Jiang Ziye could be worthy of his time.

“I didn’t expect that you would have such a deep relationship with my senior sister. However, your journey has come to an end. At least you had the chance to fight me. You can give up on my senior sister because you’re not even qualified to make it into the top ten.”

Bai Lixuan wore white clothes, which captivated everyone’s attention. He would defeat Yang Lie before Yang Lie could run into Jiang Ziye. The atmosphere between the two was filled with tension since one was a veteran and the other was a newly risen genius.

Bai Lixuan’s words had successfully piqued Yang Lie’s fighting spirits. Yang Lie sneered, “Make your move then. Let me see if you have the qualifications to be so arrogant!”

As he spoke, his aura started to rise and manifested into torrential flames. As for Bai Lixuan, lightning crackled as soon as he drew his sword. No one could see his sword ray, but they could see a thin lightning bolt.

“Get lost!” Yang Lie roared as his blazing origin energy burst forward.

Bai Lixuan’s attack was pushed backwards, but he didn’t have any panic on his face. Instead, he stabbed at Yang Lie’s chest. In that split second, lightning rumbled throughout the sky. As Bai Lixuan got close to Yang Lie, a dragon wandered through the clouds.

In that split second, the lightning in Bai Lixuan’s sword had reached a shocking level. But when Yang Lie saw this scene, he sneered with disdain in his eyes as the flames covering his body surged. Then, he soared into the sky and avoided Bai Lixuan’s attack. Using his origin energy, he manifested a gigantic flaming blade in his hand.

“Shatter!” When Bai Lixuan brandished his sword, his sword technique became even more ferocious and formed a lightning vortex. He had perfectly fused his lightning intent and sword intent together to form a completely new intent.

“I knew it.” Lin Yun already speculated that Bai Lixuan had fused his lightning intent with his sword intent, forming the lightning sword intent. There were many talented swordsmen in the Ancient Southern Domain who took another path upon reaching the limit of their xiantian sword intent. Most of them would combine their sword intent with other martial intent to seek a breakthrough.

However, this wasn’t an easy path. After all, comprehending another martial intent wasn’t easy, not to mention combining them together. It wasn’t any easier than comprehending the spiritual sword intent. Only two people had accomplished it in the Ancient Southern Domain, Nangong Wanyu, who grasped frost sword intent, and Li Mubai, who grasped the mountain river sword intent. But now, Bai Lixuan joined their ranks.

The lightning vortex instantly devoured the flaming blade as Bai Lixuan’s sword aura grew even more ferocious and covered half the stage.

“It’s actually the lightning sword intent!” All the other participants’ faces turned nasty. Not only did Bai Lixuan possess the saint physique, but he also had a powerful combined sword intent. The talent he displayed was even stronger than Lin Yun whose xiantian sword intent was only at complete mastery.

At the same time, Yang Lie’s face turned grave as he no longer dared to be careless. When they clashed, they instantly exchanged dozens of moves that filled the stage with flames and lightning. Their collision was simply too quick. Many people could keep up with their speed, but they could only see the flames and lightning exploding on the stage.

The battle lasted for a long time before a figure was sent flying. The figure was Yang Lie, who suffered a terrifying wound on his shoulder. However, the truly terrifying thing was that he felt an ache throughout his body. He was covered with lightning and couldn’t move anymore.

When he realized that he couldn’t even admit defeat, fear began to fill his pupils. There was nothing he could do even if Bai Lixuan wanted to kill him.

Bai Lixuan slowly walked out of the flames and lightning with no dust on his body. He even emitted a faint glow because of his saint physique. At this moment, his face was somewhat pale with blood on his lips. Additionally, his eyes were so sharp that no one dared to look at him directly. There was no question that the battle had come to an end.

With his hair fluttering in the wind, he sheathed his sword. A smile filled his face as he spoke, “Brother Yang, you should know the extent of my capability by now. I’m not arrogant, I’m just strong enough to defeat you.”

Although Bai Lixuan said these words, what youth wasn’t arrogant?
