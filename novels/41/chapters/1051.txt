Chapter 1052 - Shaking Windmound City

Lin Yun’s words made everyone’s heart tremble. In the next second, a golden light and a silver light flew out of Lin Yun’s body. He was unleashing both of his holy spirits at the same time. Instantly, they tore apart the multicolored light of the peacock.

“What just happened?!”

“Lin Yun also knows a holy spirit martial technique. It seems like a dual spirit technique! Unbelievable!”

“Oh my god!” The sudden change of events left the crowd shocked. No matter how they examined the current situation, Lin Yun’s Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix looked nobler than the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s holy spirit.

“Dual spirits?” The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s face changed in surprise. He was confident in his identity as a Realm Son, but he was a little shaken when he saw Lin Yun’s holy spirits. Somehow, Lin Yun was even more terrifying than he had imagined. It was now clear that Lin Yun didn’t rely on any tricks to subdue the Azure Dragon True Bone and that he obtained it with his genuine and monstrous strength.

A chink had formed in the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s invincible heart. Then again, the two holy spirits were strong, but it didn’t mean that Lin Yun could control them as he wished. The Nether Divinity Realm Son was testing this theory as his holy spirit clashed with Lin Yun’s holy spirits. At this moment, countless shockwaves spread across the sky.

When everyone looked at the phenomena, they could sense a torrential pressure. It was a pressure that came with the clash of holy spirits.

Letting out a breath, Lin Yun looked at the Nether Divinity Realm Son coldly. He could tell that the Realm Son wanted to exhaust him to death. After all, activating a holy spirit martial technique required vitality. By controlling two holy spirits at the same time, Lin Yun was bound to exhaust more vitality at a faster rate. Once he was exhausted, he would be helpless against the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

“You want me to beg for death? How naive…” The Nether Divinity Realm Son smirked before he barked, “Lin Yun, you were a nobody when I started cultivating this holy spirit martial technique. Don’t think that you’re invincible just because you grasped two holy spirits. You still have to be able to unleash their power. You’re too naive to compete with me!”

The Nether Divinity Realm Son swallowed a pellet and began to form seals with both his hands. As heaven and earth began to tremble, the rainbow peacock began to grow. When he pushed both seals out, the rainbow peacock unleashed a boundless radiance with a colossal mountain that faintly appeared in the sky. The aura alone was enough to make the crowd spit up blood.

“Greater mastery! The Nether Divinity Realm Son cultivated his holy spirit martial technique to greater mastery!”

“No wonder he’s so confident!” The crowd watched the battle with shock. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“You want me to kneel? Lin Yun, how long can you last? When you run out of vitality, I’ll force you to watch me strip Yue Weiwei! Hahaha!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son began to laugh as his eyes flashed coldly. He was vicious as he messed with Lin Yun’s weak spot.

This was a vicious scheme that was quite useful. Everyone could clearly sense that Lin Yun’s aura had grown a lot stronger due to his emotions.

In the end, Lin Yun was just a youth. The Nether Divinity Realm Son smiled before he began to laugh, “Lin Yun, Yue Weiwei is still clean. Haha, I bet you’ve never tasted her before, right? It’s a pity that I’ll be taking that from you!”

All of a sudden, the Nether Divinity Realm Son couldn’t sense any fluctuations from Lin Yun. All he could feel was a cold, chilling intent. Lin Yun squinted his eyes with a cold killing aura. His killing aura had never reached such a terrifying height before. However, he was unprecedentedly calm.

“You want to play with my emotions? You’re relying too much on that scheme of yours. Don’t assume that you’re the only one with a greater mastery holy spirit martial technique!” Lin Yun bit on his tongue and threw up a mouthful of blood. Then, he poured boundless vitality into the two holy spirits. In the next second, a boundless aura began to grow out of the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix.

“What a powerful energy fluctuation!”

“Can it be that Lin Yun’s holy spirits have also reached greater mastery?”

“How is that possible?”

The Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix began to shine brightly as they grew in size. Just how much of a monster was Lin Yun that he reached greater mastery with two holy spirits?

Just like that, three holy spirits were shining brightly. With one exchange, the crow and phoenix shattered the pressure coming from the rainbow colored peacock.

At the same time, Lin Yun clenched his fist together. It looked like he was holding both the sun and moon in his fist. As he threw a punch, space seemed to freeze for a split second, which caused everyone’s heart to pause.

In the next second, Lin Yun’s punch shattered the space that the Nether Divinity Realm Son was in. He caused the Nether Divinity Realm Son to throw up a mouthful of blood.

He wanted to bring out his treasures to resist the power of Lin Yun’s punch, but Lin Yun’s attack was simply too fast. Instead, he painfully landed on the ground.

“Damn it!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son panicked because he discovered that his bones were cracking under the immense pressure from the two holy spirits. He had many treasures and techniques that he couldn’t use right now, so he had to face the holy spirits head-on.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son squinted his eyes because he discovered that both his feet were trembling. It was simply unimaginable to him because he would be thoroughly humiliated in front of everyone.

Thinking about it, the Nether Divinity Realm Son felt fear as his back started to sweat. After all, he was a Realm Son who came from the Nether Divinity War Realm. How could he possibly kneel before Lin Yun? But before he could think, he was already on his knees from Lin Yun’s immense pressure.

“Oh my god!” Many people exclaimed as they flew into the sky. THeir mouths were wide open as they witnessed an unforgettable scene.

“How is this possible?!” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son who wasn’t optimistic for Lin Yun was now wearing an ugly expression. After all, it was simply unimaginable for a Realm Son to kneel before Lin Yun.

He could feel the stinging pain on his cheeks because he ridiculed Lin Yun earlier and forced Pei Xue to leave Lin Yun. It was especially painful since he claimed that Lin Yun would definitely die. It seemed like everything that he said was turning around to bite him.

Although he wasn’t on the same side as the Nether Divinity Realm Son, the Nether Divinity Realm Son was at the same level as him. Clearly, he misjudged Lin Yun’s strength.

“Stop!” Everything took place too quickly, so the Profound Dragon and Elysium Trigram Realm Sons barely recovered from their shock. At this moment, their faces were red because they too remembered how arrogant they were earlier.

“Die!” Ignoring the furious roars from the Profound Dragon and Elysium Trigram Realm Sons, Lin Yun threw out another punch at an unprecedented speed.
