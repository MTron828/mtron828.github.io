Chapter 1345 - Fight on the Lake

Qin Cang’s killing intent surged when he saw the Profound Wither Key fall into Su Ziyao’s hand and pushed his palm out. As his aura swept out like a peacock tail, Lin Yun circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and retaliated with the Flicking Divine Finger.

As a sea of flowers appeared behind him, all of the power focused on his fingertip. When the flowers bloomed, they shone brightly and Lin Yun pushed the Iris Sword Sutra and Flicking Divine Finger to the limit. When Lin Yun flicked his finger, a sword ray shot out and flew towards the Golden Dragon Bone located in Qin Cang’s chest.

Qin Cang was surprised when he saw this scene and gathered all his energy in his palm before pushing it out. When his attack collided with the sword ray, the purple sword ray that Lin Yun unleashed began to crumble into pieces.

“Junior Brother Lin, watch out!” Ye Ziling looked at Lin Yun nervously and felt bad that she couldn’t help Lin Yun at all.

Su Ziyao grabbed her and said, “You’ve just gained control of the Divine Dragon Sword Physique, and the seal on your bloodline had just recently been lifted. So you don’t have to blame yourself for it.”

Ye Ziling was also a decisive person. Upon hearing that, they began to head to where the mountain was and bolted towards the gate at the summit of the mountain.

When Qin Cang raised his head to look at Lin Yun, his eyes flashed with rage, and coldly said, “You think I don’t dare to kill you or you think I can’t kill you? I’ve not even used half of my strength in our previous fight. You’re simply courting death by trying to hinder me from taking the Great Saint Origin!”

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun calmly said, “You can just come at me. There’s no need to waste time on words.”

Lin Yun had to admit that facing Qin Cang made him feel a great pressure, but how could a swordsman be afraid of death? The moment he walked on the path of a swordsman, it was destined that he couldn’t live a normal life. He would either live his life blazingly or die trying, not to mention that it wasn’t easy for Qin Cang to kill him, either.

“Hmph!” Qin Cang coldly snorted. Taking a step forth, he appeared behind Lin Yun with his hand forming into a claw and reached for him. If Lin Yun was really caught by his claw, then Lin Yun’s head would immediately be crushed.

Facing his attack, Lin Yun’s astral energy crumbled into pieces and Qin Cang’s claw wasn’t far from his head anymore. His close combat skills came from the Dragon Clan’s martial technique, the Dragon Claw Fist. Executing it with the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art, it could allow him to manifest the dragon claw, dragon fist, and dragon palm.

Each of the forms were terrifying, not to mention that Qin Cang even had the Golden Dragon Bone, allowing him to execute it more smoothly, and the power would also reach a terrifying height.

Facing Qin Cang’s attack, a pair of golden wings unfolded behind Lin Yun and he took out the Lightning Shadow Sword from his sword box. But the golden wings merely blocked Qin Cang’s dragon claw for a brief moment before they were torn to pieces and turned into golden feathers.

Taking this opportunity, Lin Yun turned back and thrust his sword. His sword blocked the dragon claw. But Lin Yun didn’t have any change on his face and triggered the divine rune in the Lightning Shadow Sword with his sword intent. As the light shone out from the Lightning Shadow Sword, the power of the thousand-rune saint artifact was fully brought out.

This made Qin Cang exclaim before he quickly stopped. But his arm was left bloody under the countless sword rays with countless wounds on his arm. Even the sleeve of his clothes was torn apart, and this made his arm look terrifying.

Qin Cang was furious after seeing the Lightning Shadow Sword and circulated the Golden Dragon Bone. As his left hand manifested into a golden dragon claw, it came crashing down on Lin Yun. When the golden dragon claw was formed, it attracted a draconic roar, and golden light also exploded from him before soaring to the sky.

At the same time, an extremely terrifying aura also swept out and instantly attracted everyone’s attention. Facing his attack, the Lightning Shadow Sword was knocked away, flying from his hand.

“Your attainment in the sword dao is really terrifying to be able to control a thousand-rune saint artifact. I believe no swordsman at the Elysium Core Realm back in the Ancient Barren Domain can be compared to you!” Earlier, when he faced Lin Yun’s attack, it felt as though his entire arm was about to be shredded into pieces, but Qin Cang had no fear and laughed.

“Golden Dragon Skypatching Art!” Circulating his body-refining technique, he could feel an immense vitality flowing throughout his body that pressed down on Lin Yun once more. This made Lin Yun lock his brows together because the azure dragon was crushed earlier, so he couldn’t use it anytime soon.

But he would also suffer a loss if he fought Qin Cang head-on, and this would only put him in an even more disadvantageous position. If he had a choice, then he definitely wouldn’t let Qin Cang get close to him, but he also couldn’t increase the distance between them right now. The moment he put some distance between them, Qin Cang would be able to head to the summit of the mountain right away.

“Divine Solar Lunar Fist!” A decisive light flashed through Lin Yun’s eyes as he took a step forth. As a golden crow and silver phoenix flew from his body, they manifested into the heavens and earth before entering his fist.

This was the Heaven and Earth Unite of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. When both sides collided, they then retreated but Lin Yun clearly took a lot more steps than Qin Cang.

“Interesting…if I remember correctly, the Divine Solar Lunar Fist should be a holy spirit martial technique, and it can be ranked in the top ten. In terms of explosive power, it’s not at all inferior to my Dragon Clan’s fist technique. Flower Burial, you have really given me a lot of surprises!” Qin Cang knew that if he didn’t have the Golden Dragon Bone and his cultivation was a lot higher, he definitely wouldn’t be able to obtain such an advantage.

“Looks like I have to be a little more serious as a form of respect to you.” Qin Cang stabilized himself and placed both his hands before him. When he slowly parted his hands, there seemed to be something in his embrace.

In the next second, the Golden Dragon Bone in his chest began to shine and a golden dragon flew out. But the dragon didn’t fly from his body, it only coiled before his chest, looking as though Qin Cang was embracing a golden sun.

The power contained in the sun was so terrifying that it lit up the surroundings. The commotion caused by the sun alarmed everyone and made their faces change.

“Golden Dragon Heavenly Destruction!” Qin Cang roared and the ‘sun’ before his chest flew out, turning into a vivid golden dragon that flew towards Lin Yun. In the path of the golden dragon, everything quickly crumbled, destroying the phenomenon created by Lin Yun’s attack. His attack was so strong that it even left fine cracks in the surrounding space.

The black miasma on the lake evaporated under the golden sun, and the lakewater even started to boil. The dazzling light also made Lin Yun bleed from his eyes, and he could only see a huge patch of gold.

“He’s already so strong without even summoning his constellation?” Nangong Ze and the rest were also attracted by the commotion. Looking from afar, their faces were grave because it had been a mystery how strong Qin Cang was. It was rare for Qin Cang to even encounter an opponent that could bring out his full strength. So the power he had displayed right now had left all the fated transcendents shocked.

Not far away, Cang Yun muttered to himself, “Don’t tell me that he’ll die in the pagoda?”

Nangong Ze and the rest were attracted by the commotion that Qin Cang had caused. Many people suspected that Su Ziyao and the rest might be on the mountain, and the mountain might be where the Great Saint Origin was located.

Just when everyone felt that the golden dragon was about to turn Lin Yun into ashes, Lin Yun began to release the light of the sun and moon as a draconic roar echoed from his body. As a dazzling beam of light exploded from Lin Yun and soared to the sky, it instantly stopped the golden dragon’s aura. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Divine Solar Lunar Fist—Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron!” As Lin Yun let out a ferocious roar, he threw a punch, and his fist manifested into a huge cauldron. With a huge collision, a bright light shone that left everyone shocked. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun managed to withstand this attack without even summoning his constellation.

This made everyone wonder what kind of monsters Qin Cang and Lin Yun were. In a split second, everyone could feel their scalps going numb and a chill down their spines. Regardless of Lin Yun or Qin Cang, the strength displayed by them had surpassed other fated transcendents. Perhaps only the two of them could be considered real fated transcendents.

“It’s my turn now. You can try and take an attack from me!” Lin Yun stomped his foot on the surface of the lake and charged forth. As the power of the sun and moon filled his body, every single punch he threw would cause the sky to turn dark, and only his punch was emitting an eternal light.

“Golden Dragon Sky Opening Palm!” Qin Cang had no fear and wanted to use his Golden Dragon Skypatching Art to manifest the opening of the sky. This palm technique was great and open, and every single attack contained the power to split the sky. At the depths of the lake, the countless corpses within also began to surge even more violently.

With another attack, Lin Yun was forced to take ten-odd steps back while Qin Cang merely took three steps back. Taking advantage of the retreat, Lin Yun pushed a palm out before landing on the mountain. Su Ziyao and the others had reached the summit of the mountain, so there was no need for Lin Yun to fight Qin Cang to the end, since he also wanted to enter the stone gate.

At the same time, countless people from the surroundings flew towards the mountain. When Qin Cang saw this scene, rage flashed through his pupils, and he waved his hand. “Get lost!”

As a gigantic dragon tail swept out, several people were instantly killed before they could even respond. As for those who managed to survive the attack, they were all throwing blood and nearly fainted.

“Death to anyone who dares to climb the mountain!” Qin Cang made a domineering declaration that instantly intimidated everyone. This made everyone nervous, and none of them dared to act recklessly. At the same time, Nangong Ze and the rest also took in a deep breath because they were also tempted earlier and wanted to take this opportunity to climb the mountain. But they were feeling fortunate that they weren’t reckless.

“Hmph!” After Qin Cang killed ten-odd people, he coldly looked at Lin Yun before stomping his foot on the ground and soaring to the sky. Right at this moment, zither music resounded that set up an array before Qin Cang.

“Luo Shuyi!” Lin Yun was shocked as he raised his head to look at Luo Shuyi, who was strumming her fingers in the air. He was curious as to why Luo Shuyi would want to help him, and this was already the second time. The first time might be because of Mu Qingqing, but this time, she had even offended Qin Cang.

“Lin Yun, grab on!” Su Ziyao opened the stone gate before a white cloth flew out. When Lin Yun grabbed onto the white cloth, a powerful force instantly dragged him to the summit of the mountain before Su Ziyao grabbed him and entered the stone gate, “Enter!”
