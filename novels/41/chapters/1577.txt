Chapter 1578 - Wind, Fire, Lightning, and Ice

The key lied in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. If the Sword Sect lost again, it would be hard for the Sword Sect to make a comeback, even if his master made it through this ordeal. After all, even a holy land wouldn’t be able to suffer having a few generations of geniuses wiped out, and Lin Yun couldn’t put it all on his master’s shoulders. Thus, his mood gradually lifted.

“Junior Brother Lin, what do you want this time? You can secretly tell me, and I can tell you what treasure my father has.” Mu Xueqin smiled. Lin Yun had fought on behalf of the Sword Sect at the Heavenly Pool Gathering this time, and the news would definitely shake the sect. This would also significantly boost the Sword Sect’s morale. After all, it was rare for the Sword Sect to be so elated.

Seeing Mu Xueqin’s serious expression, Lin Yun couldn’t help laughing. But he never thought of it before because he was a disciple of the Sword Sect, and the Sword Sect was good enough for him.

“Uhhh… A drop of blood from the divine beast, Black Tortoise’s bloodline.” Lin Yun briefly paused, then continued, “Or any information related to it.”

If the Sword Sect had the blood of the Black Tortoise bloodline, it shouldn’t have been hard for his senior brother to obtain it. So he settled with the information about it. Mu Chuan felt that his comprehension wasn’t enough. So he didn’t spend more time on the Black Tortoise Breathing. But Lin Yun wanted to give it a try and try to grasp the Divine Tortoise Transformation.

“Is there a use for it?” Mu Xueqin couldn’t figure out why Lin Yun needed it.

“Yeah. Let’s go with that.” Lin Yun said quickly, fearing Mu Xueqin would continue to ‘con’ her father.

“Alright. I’ll look around for you.” Mu Xueqin smiled.

After returning to the sect, all the disciples were gathered at the foot of the mountain. They already knew what happened during the Heavenly Pool Gathering, and everyone could feel their blood boiling. They all wanted to see Lin Yun the moment he returned.

This formation startled Lin Yun, but the saint disciples beside him wore smiles as they looked at Lin Yun with flames blazing in their eyes. The entire Sword Sect was waiting for him to grow up, and even Ye Ziyun, who didn’t have much belonging to the Sword Sect, couldn’t help feeling something about Lin Yun when she saw this scene. This was a pretty good feeling, and she couldn’t help smiling.

Even Lin Yun, who didn’t like this sort of scene, couldn’t help smiling and felt a surge of warmth within his chest. When they returned to the sect, Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to return to the Divine Firmament Peak.

When Zhao Yan showed great interest when Lin Yun told him about the Carefree 9 Swords’ Profound Sword Form, he briefly pondered before he decided that he might as well teach him the first four sword forms.

“What sword technique is this?” Zhao Yan was shocked upon understanding the sword technique. He could feel that this sword technique was profound and had a considerable origin. But Lin Yun was willing to teach it to him? He was worried that Lin Yun might be in trouble because he knew that such a special martial technique couldn’t be casually taught to others. He even suspected that it might be taught to Lin Yun by the Radiant Sword Saint.

“This is a sword technique left behind by the Southern Emperor. There are still four or maybe five sword forms I’ve not learned. So I can’t teach them to you for now.” Lin Yun had considered it well before teaching Zhao Yan. This sword technique wasn’t easy to learn, and Zhao Yan was a perfect match for this because he was a sword fanatic. Not to mention that the Southern Emperor didn’t say that he couldn’t teach it to others.

“Oh? It’s fine as long as it’s not from Senior Radiant.” Zhao Yan happily smiled, and his response made Lin Yun stumped because Zhao Yan didn’t show any reaction when he said that it was a sword technique from the Southern Emperor.

“Lin Yun, I’ll go study it. Remember to teach me the rest when you have mastered them!” Zhao Yan was excited, with his eyes shining brightly. “Heaven Sword Form, Earth Sword Form…”

Lin Yun held onto his chin and smiled because it was pretty good this way. When he returned to the Divine Firmament Peak, Chief Disciple Feng Luan immediately rushed over. He was here to deliver something to Lin Yun. It was an interspatial bottle with considerable weight.

“What is this?” Lin Yun asked.

“I don’t know? Your friend tasked me with passing it to you, and she says her surname is An.” Feng Luan handed the bottle to Lin Yun and continued, “It’s pretty heavy. So take it.”

“True Dragon Saint Liquid!” Lil’ Purple exclaimed from the sword box before Lin Yun could say a word. This bottle probably contained True Dragon Saint Liquid from An Liuyan.

“Thank you, Senior Brother.” Lin Yun thanked him.

“This is nothing. I’ll not bother you now.” Feng Luan rubbed his head, and his eyes shone when he looked at Lin Yun. He could still remember how he led Lin Yun into the Divine Firmament Peak a year ago. It had only been a year, and Lin Yun had already grown so much. Not only the Divine Firmament Peak but everyone within the Sword Sect was shocked by his growth.

After Feng Luan left, Lin Yun opened the bottle. The content was nearly 60,000 kilograms of True Dragon Saint liquid. Lin Yun was shocked when he checked the bottle. Could it be that An Liuyan emptied the Heavenly Astral Pavilion of True Dragon Saint Liquid? It looks like the rumors were true about An Liuyan being wealthy.

“Hehe, I’m starting to like that little lass even more. I’ve decided to ignore anything that happens between you two!” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“What are you thinking about?”

“I understand men, especially a scumbag like you. You’re probably after her body, since you even gave her the White Dragon Bone.” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“Shut up.”

“Hehe. I’m right on, aren’t I? But don’t worry, I’ll keep it a secret.” Lil’ Purple smiled as she hugged the bottle.

But Lin Yun had to admit that An Liuyan had a voluptuous figure, and it was tough for anyone not to be attracted to her.

“Hmph, you scumbag. You’re thinking about her, right?” Lil’ Purple snorted.

“I’ll keep the True Dragon Saint Liquid for now.” Lin Yun replied indifferently.

“Wait! I’m sorry! Lin Yun, you’re the best! I’m really sorry! You won’t hold it against a child like me, right?”

Lin Yun smiled upon seeing this and flew towards the Cloud Soaring Peak, not caring about Lil’ Purple. This made Lil’ Purple even more anxious.

“Come to the Saint Mountain.” A voice echoed within his mind right then, which made Lin Yun rejoice because this was the voice of his master. He long wanted to see his master but didn’t dare to disrupt him. Upon receiving his master’s summons, he immediately executed his movement technique and rushed over.

The Saint Mountain still looked the same as before; his master was writing on a stone table. At times, Lin Yun would be confused by this scene. Shouldn’t his master be in seclusion? So why was his master so relaxed every time they met? His master looked the same as before, aside from not leaving the cave, except that he seemed a little older.

“You’re here.” The Radiant Sword Saint smiled, seeing Lin Yun’s arrival.

When Lin Yun glanced at the paper, he noticed that his master wasn’t writing but had painted a budding flower. He quickly went down on one knee, “This disciple pays his greetings to Master.”

“Come closer, and let me take a look at you.” The Radiant Sword Saint waved his hand. When Lin Yun got close, his eyes shone with sword rays, and a smile rose on his lips, “Ten-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm! Good!”

“It’s all luck.” Lin Yun smiled, but he was excited in his heart.

“There’s actually no need to pursue it in the current era, so you must have suffered to attain it.” The Radiant Sword Saint didn’t go to the Heavenly Pool Manor, but it was as though he knew what had happened there.

“It’s too much of a pity if I don’t give it a try with my Blue Dragon Bone. But fortunately, I succeeded!” Lin Yun replied.

“How many sword forms are you left with the Carefree 9 Swords?” The Radiant Sword Saint asked with a smile.

“Four… or five…”

“Train here for some time!” The Radiant Sword Saint said.

“Okay.” Lin Yun rejoiced when he heard that. With his master’s guidance, it should be easier for him to master the Carefree 9 Swords, especially the last sword. He might be able to comprehend it.

“Let me take a look at that rose painting.”

When Lin Yun took out the painting and handed it over, the Radiant Sword Saint’s hands were trembling with shock in his eyes once he looked at the painting because he could sense how powerful the danger hidden in the painting was.

When he opened the painting, the sky turned dark, and Lin Yun could feel a chill down his spine before he could even react. It felt as though he had plunged into hell. But before he could think more about it, a smear of light suddenly appeared within the darkness, and the light came from his master. Shortly after, the light spread out, and the surroundings returned to normal.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“This is profound, and it’s hard to even look at it.” The Radiant Sword Saint muttered.

“Master, are you alright?” Lin Yun quickly stepped forth and supported the Radiant Sword Saint.

“Haha!” The Radiant Sword Saint laughed and took up the brush on the table. “Look well. I’ll draw what I saw for you.”

The Radiant Sword Saint’s brush was enveloped in a holy light this time as petals flew out from the paper. The petals looked vivid, and when Lin Yun tried to hold them, multiple figures flew out from his master’s brush.

As the Radiant Sword Saint’s movement speed increased, more figures flew out from the paper, and every figure was donned in an azure robe. The facial features were blurred, but Lin Yun felt that it was the Southern Emperor, whom he had seen before in the painting.

It didn’t take long for hundreds of ‘Southern Emperors’ to fly out from the paper wielding swords and performing different sword techniques. Every figure was performing a sword technique, but they were also different because they were filled with profundity.

Although there were many transformations, the attributes of those figures were between the wind, fire, lightning, and ice. When those figures scattered, they became densely packed scriptures in the air. Lin Yun swiftly memorized them, not daring to miss out on any of them.

Those four sword forms were the most lethal sword forms in the Carefree 9 Swords because the intent contained in each sword form was at the limit. When all the scriptures converged, they formed into four words: wind, fire, lightning, and ice.

When the four words were going to merge once more and form into a new word, this made Lin Yun’s eyes light up because this must be the ninth sword form. But the Radiant Sword Saint suddenly lightly furrowed his brows and stopped.
