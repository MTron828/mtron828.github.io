Chapter 1229 - Versus Xiahou Jue

“You know about the Crimson Moon Elysium?” Lin Yun asked.

“I’ve had interactions with the Crimson Moon Cult. This cult has a long history that dates back to the ancient era. They were also the strongest force back when the Demon Domain was established, resisting the entire Demon Domain all by themselves. If it wasn’t for the Demon Emperor’s appearance, they would have ruled over the entire Demon Domain.” Luo Hua then told Lin Yun that Xiahou Jue might be a candidate as a holy son.

Picking a holy son was a brutal process of the Crimson Moon Cult. They picked nine people out of thousands of geniuses. First, they waited for the candidates to grow up. Then, they would have them kill each other until only nine remained. Those remaining nine were the holy sons.

Xiahou Jue truly fit the bill as a holy son because he kept a low-profile and only appeared recently. At the same time, Lin Yun finally knew that he would be fighting the Crimson Moon Elysium’s holy son.

“They have nine holy sons?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s because there is a divine son above them. The holy sons are the shadows of the divine son. When a divine son dies, a new divine son will be picked from the holy sons. Only the divine son has the qualification to inherit the Crimson Moon Cult. As for the current divine son, no one in the Kunlun Realm knows about them,” smiled Luo Hua.

At this moment, Lin Yun felt that what he had seen right now was only the tip of the iceberg, and he was still inexperienced. Thinking about it, Lin Yun’s fighting spirit started to burn ferociously. If he couldn’t even defeat a holy son candidate, then he wouldn’t even be able to face a genuine holy son, let alone a divine son!

Before dawn arrived, countless people could be seen streaking across the sky in the Profound Azure City. As the final battle of the ranking battle, the fight between Lin Yun and Xiahou Jue was extremely crowded. After all, these two were legends who appeared out of nowhere and displayed outstanding strength.

“I wonder who will win. The two of them seem to have a lot of secrets.”

“Why is Xiahou Jue here so early?” Everyone’s gazes fell onto Xiahou Jue who was resting with his eyes closed. His presence drew countless gazes.

It was hard for anyone to detect his presence at first glance, but their attention would be drawn to him once they noticed his presence. Many people weren’t unfamiliar with Xiahou Jue because his name was ranked in the top 3,000 on the empyrean ranking. But they never expected that such a genius would be nurtured by the Profound Azure Prefecture’s branch of the Crimson Moon Elysium.

“The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect is here!” When Lin Yun’s party arrived, it caused an uproar on the plaza. But this time, there was a mysterious veiled woman and no one could guess her identity.

But everyone’s attention was on Lin Yun. Lin Yun calmly saw through the crowd and wasn’t in a hurry because he saw Xiahou Jue resting. But when Xiahou Jue sensed Lin Yun’s gaze, he slowly opened his eyes.

There was a crimson moon in his pupils that made the entire sky look red. When his gaze turned in Lin Yun’s direction, it instantly made everyone feel a chill down their spines.

“Xiahou Jue.” Ye Ziling and the rest also detected Xiahou Jue’s presence. When they saw him seated on the stage, they were all surprised to see that he was really early. It looked like he was confident that he would win.

At the same time, this made them worry for Lin Yun. They weren’t sure if he had any chance of winning.

But after that night, they all had a new understanding of Lin Yun’s strength, especially the legendary Lightning Shadow Sword. This meant that there was a high possibility that Lin Yun went to challenge the Sword Assembly the few days he wasn’t around. The news hadn’t spread out. But when the news spread out, it would definitely shake the entire Profound Azure Prefecture and the accomplishment wouldn’t be any lesser than ranking in the top 3,000 on the empyrean ranking.

“Where did the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect find such a genius?” A few elders from the Crimson Moon Elysium were looking at Lin Yun. If it wasn’t for Lin Yun, they wouldn’t even worry about the outcome of the Profound Azure Prefecture’s ranking battle. But now, they could only place all their hopes on Xiahou Jue.

“Hehe, don’t worry about it. With his strength, no one in the Profound Azure Prefecture can threaten him. His gaze should be out of the Profound Azure Prefecture, and with his talent, he will definitely have a position even in the Ancient Barren Domain. After all, he’s a candidate for the holy son!” The black-clothed elder taking the lead said with a smile. He was the Grand Elder of the Crimson Moon Elysium, Chen Mu.

He had personally led the party over to make sure that there wouldn’t be any mishaps in the ranking battle. He was also the one who wanted to change the rules. In his view, it was too stupid to go five versus five with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect because they would be betting on their luck.

If it was only one against one, Xiahou Jue was absolutely invincible among the younger generation and there wouldn’t be any chance for the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect no matter where Lin Yun came from.

Lin Yun also didn’t hesitate to descend onto the stage. Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun’s gaze became sharp. His fighting spirit had reached an unprecedented height after Luo Hua told him that Xiahou Jue was a holy son candidate.

“You’re late,” said Xiahou Jue.

“Coming early doesn’t mean anything,” said Lin Yun coldly.

“It means I’m confident to win!” Xiahou Jue smiled before his sharp gaze collided with Lin Yun’s gaze.

Before they even fought, the atmosphere had already become intense. Everyone could tell that neither Lin Yun nor Xiahou Jue would admit defeat.

“Last battle of the ranking battle begins!” When the prefectural lord made the announcement, both Lin Yun and Xiahou Jue were secretly looking for each other’s weaknesses.

When the prefectural lord made the announcement, Xiahou Jue reached out and a metallic luster flickered on his nails. As boundless crimson spread out on the ground, Lin Yun locked his brows together because he could sense that something wasn’t right.

Before Lin Yun could sense it, a crimson moon had enveloped the entire heaven and earth. Xiahou Jue was confident and had unleashed a barrage of attacks when the prefectural lord made the announcement.

Under the crimson moon, Xiahou Jue turned into black figure that left behind a demonic aura in his path, corroding everything it touched. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“What a bizarre martial technique!” Lin Yun squinted his eyes. He could sense a terrifying poison in the demonic aura. It wasn’t a normal poison as there was something weird going on.
