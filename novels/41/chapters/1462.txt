Chapter 1463 - Late

Back at the Celestial Observing Stage, the surroundings were filled with disciples from the various peaks looking at the boundless sea of clouds with curiosity in their pupils. They weren’t strangers to the Celestial Observing Stage, but few people knew what was under the clouds.

Three thousand years ago, Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng leveled two peaks with one sword, causing the Sword Sect to fall from being a holy land. But his sword ray was preserved and was located in this Celestial Observing Stage.

But not many people have seen that sword ray before. There were rumors that time was messed up beneath the sea of clouds due to Yu Qingfeng’s sword. Usually, everyone only had to sit on the Celestial Observing Stage to sense the boundless sword intent in the surroundings, and you could always gain something by meditating.

This time, the Five Peaks Competition would all the seal to be lifted so that everyone would have an opportunity to see the sword ray that was left behind by Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng. No disciples of the Sword Sect could forget Yu Qingfeng’s name because he was the one who brought humiliation upon the Sword Sect. But everyone knew that he was unrivaled as a swordsman in the Divine Dragon Era, granting him the title of Sword Emperor.

Right then, a figure flew over from the Golden Firmament Peak and landed on the Celestial Observing Stage, causing exclamations amongst the crowd. It was Jin Xuanyi who arrived. Jin Xuanyi walked slowly when he descended, making others feel as if he was a moving mountain. His sword intent was as massive as a mountain, which gave others that misconception.

“Jin Xuanyi!” Gongsun Yan solemnly said beside Chen Ling. He had to admit that Jin Xuanyi’s temperament was unique, and his appearance alone was enough to make him stand out from the crowd. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Senior Brother Jin is here!”

“Judging from Senior Brother Jin’s expression, he has probably become stronger over the past few months!”

“The others from the Earth Ranking are strong, but pale in comparison to Senior Brother Jin. Haha, I heard there’s a rumor that Senior Brother Jin has defeated a deacon at the first pulse of the Dragon Pulse Realm!”

“Are you serious about that?”

“Who knows? It’s a rumor, but there’s a high possibility of it being true.” That rumor caused another uproar on the Celestial Observing Stage because Jin Xuanyi defeated a deacon while he was at the Elysium Core Realm. Putting it bluntly, deacons were disciples that were eliminated.

Even if they weren’t outstanding amongst the disciples, they were stronger than the Dragon Pulse Realm experts outside the sect. But Jin Xuanyi actually defeated a deacon? This was a piece of shocking news to everyone.

Three figures descended from the sky like three bright suns before they landed on the side of the Scarlet Firmament Peak. The one standing in the middle was a youth with a flawless appearance. He was Ji Shuxuan.

“Ji Shuxuan is here!”

“The Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking are here. They should be the protagonists in this Five Peaks Competition.”

“The two will most likely make a breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm next year. So this Five Peaks Competition should be the last time the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking will fight. After all, they won’t be on the Earth Ranking in the future.”

“I wonder if Jin Xuanyi will be able to win. In the past, Ji Shuxuan always had the upper hand in their fights.”

“I’m unconvinced. Ji Shuxuan is the sect master’s disciple from the Scarlet Firmament Peak. If Senior Brother Jin has the same conditions, he wouldn’t be any weaker than Ji Shuxuan!” The surrounding atmosphere immediately climaxed along with Ji Shuxuan’s arrival.

Regardless of Ji Shuxuan or Jin Xuanyi, they had a lot of fans in the sect. So it naturally caused an argument when someone said Ji Shuxuan was stronger than Jin Xuanyi.

“Wait, where’s Lin Yun?” Someone said, immediately causing the surroundings to become silent. When everyone swept their gazes around, they were shocked to discover that Lin Yun was nowhere to be found.

This was because Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan had attracted their attention, so they forgot about Lin Yun for the time being. But speaking of which, Lin Yun kept a low profile for the past three months. Three months wasn’t too long or short, but there had been no news of Lin Yun after he defeated Huangfu Yan in front of the Great Profound Palace.

After all, Huangfu Yan made a breakthrough to the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, but there wasn’t any news about Lin Yun. Even the Divine Firmament Peak’s disciples had no idea what Lin Yun was doing. Then again, this was normal for Lin Yun to digest what he had after joining the Sword Sect.

But the impression that Lin Yun gave everyone was too great; defeating Xiahou Yan before he joined the sect, staying in the Saint Pool for a month, reaching the pinnacle of the second stage in the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra during his first visit to the Great Profound Palace, and defeating Huangfu Yan.

This placed Lin Yun in the center of attention, which was why everyone felt weird when Lin Yun kept a low profile over the past three months.

“I bet he won’t come. The top ten on the Earth Ranking are the protagonists of this Five Peak Competition. Or, to be precise, the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking. He’ll only be a side character, even if he comes.”

“I heard that those in the top ten of the Earth Ranking are planning to teach Lin Yun a lesson during this Five Peaks Competition.”

“This is why I’m not optimistic about him. Now is not the time for him to face the top ten of the Earth Ranking.” After a brief silence, the surrounding disciples began to analyze amongst themselves.

While everyone was in the middle of their discussions, five figures descended from the sky. The one in the center was donned in a scarlet robe, and the aura he gave off was stronger than the other four beside him. He was the sect master of the Sword Sect, Mu Xuankong!

“We pay our respects to the sect master!” All the disciples cupped their hands as they greeted Mu Xuankong. They were also surprised because they didn’t think that the five peak masters would show up simultaneously, not to mention that the sect master was also present.

“There really are a lot of people here. It looks like the Five Peak Competition will be more lively this year. You guys don’t have to be so polite.” Mu Xuankong smiled and looked amicable.

“This Five Peak Competition isn’t any different from the past. So everyone can just do their best. But…” Mu Xuankong briefly paused to arouse everyone’s interest before he continued with a smile, “But the rules are slightly different this time. The champion will be given a Dragon-Blooded Crystal by me aside from the normal rewards.”

Everyone was briefly shocked before they burst into an uproar. The Dragon-Blooded Crystal was a metal nourished by a dragon’s blood, and it was a treasure on the same level as the Divine Golden Crow Iron.

Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan were surprised and wore complicated looks. They understood what the sect master intended to do. The sect master gave Lin Yun the Divine Golden Crow Iron not too long ago, causing the top ten of the Earth Ranking to be unhappy. So the Dragon-Blooded Crystal could be considered compensation for them. After all, they didn’t think that Lin Yun could become the champion of this Five Peaks Competition, so the champion would only be either Jin Xuanyi or Ji Shuxuan.

“Aside from that, those who enter the top ten will be given a tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead each.” Another heavy news dropped, bringing smiles to those who were in the top ten on the Earth Ranking. The Five Peak Competition this year was different from the past. Aside from contributions and saint pellets, they would also be given a tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead each.

When Mu Xuankong explained the rules, it wasn’t complicated and easy to understand after a brief explanation. Under the sea of clouds was a lake called the Celestial Observing Lake. Due to Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng’s sword intent, the lake gave birth to a species of bizarre flowers, the Azure Lotus Sword Flower. Those who obtained the most Azure Lotus Sword Flowers would have a higher ranking.

Then again, the Azure Lotus Sword Flowers were also graded from the first to ninth grade. A second-grade azure lotus was equivalent to ten first-grade azure lotuses. There was only one ninth-grade azure lotus, so whoever obtained it would immediately become the champion!

“The Azure Lotus Sword Flowers might be treasures, but you guys can’t be reckless. Don’t try to pick an Azure Lotus Sword Flower that far exceeds your strength.” Mu Xuankong smiled. “Now, if there are no objections, let the Five Peaks Competition begin!”

Mu Chuan opened his mouth and wanted to say something since he couldn’t see Lin Yun’s figure anywhere. He couldn’t help feeling a little anxious after seeing that the Five Peaks Competition was about to start.

But a streak broke through the clouds and quickly approached the Celestial Observing Stage. This streak of light was so dazzling that it was brighter than the sun.

As everyone became surprised and wondered who this person was, a pair of Golden Crow Wings unfolded Lin Yun slowly descended, basking under the sunlight. After stowing the Golden Crow Wings back into his body, Lin Yun stepped forth and cupped his hands together. “Divine Firmament Peak’s Lin Yun greets the sect master and all the peak masters.”

“You’re late!” Mu Xuankong smiled.

“Uh… Am I? I don’t think so…” Lin Yun awkwardly smiled. He had already traveled at full speed, but the journey was too long, and he was slightly late for the Five Peaks Competition.

“Haha, you have no say in this. Since you’re late, you naturally have to pay the price. So you must stay here for an hour before joining the Five Peaks competition.” Mu Xuankong smiled before he waved his hand, unleashing a sword ray that restricted Lin Yun’s movements.

This made those in the top ten on the Earth Ranking briefly stunned before they gloated. This meant that Lin Yun had no chance in the Five Peaks Competition. Huangfu Yan was the most thrilled amongst them, wearing a sinister smile.

Lin Yun held onto his chin and revealed a bitter smile. He managed to make it in time every time just before he was late, but he had messed up this time. It looks like the Five Peaks Competition no longer had anything to do with him.
