FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The entire plaza fell into a deadly silence as everyone looked at Lin Yun with unconcealable shock in their eyes. When the battle began, no one would have thought that Lin Yun would be able to give Zhang He a beating.

After all, Zhang He declared that he came to the Profound Azure Prefecture for Flower Burial to take revenge for what happened in the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. However, Zhang He failed to find Flower Burial and was beaten by a genius of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect instead.

The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party was all shocked before joy flashed across their faces. Only Ye Ziling managed to maintain her composure. But even so, there was a flash of surprise through her pupils while she began to wonder what happened to Lin Yun over the last few days.

Lin Yun had a strong killing aura on him and he had also undergone a transformation. Could it be that he left with Luo Hua for some mission?

“This fellow is a little terrifying that even Zhang He was so badly defeated…” Chu Tianhao squinted his eyes and wore a grave expression. Could it be that the rumors were true and that Lin Yun had really reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm?

Even if that were true, Lin Yun shouldn’t be so overwhelmingly strong. After all, Zhang He brought out his constellation. Despite his trump card, Zhang He lost terribly. It seemed that Lin Yun’s attainment in the sword was a lot more terrifying than what he had shown so far.

Chu Tianhao thought it was strange because he didn’t hear much about Lin Yun previously. It was as if Lin Yun had appeared out of nowhere. Then again, Chu Tianhao was confident in his own strength. Lin Yun’s performance would only make him treat their fight more seriously.

“He alone can’t support the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. They have to win at least three rounds, and there’s no way we will lose unless he picks the hell challenge!” The second senior disciple of the Suspend King Palace’s eyes flashed with ferocity.

Chu Tianhao’s pupils flashed with lingering fear when the hell challenge was brought up. However, he immediately shook his head. Chu Tianhao didn’t even think that the Crimson Blood Elysium’s genius dared to take on the challenge, let alone Lin Yun. No one in their right mind would try since it was meant for genuine experts.

This was Lin Yun’s first battle after reaching the Empyrean Realm. Although he fought with the lesser Elysium Core Realm expert, he relied on the Lightning Shadow Sword. So it couldn’t be considered a genuine battle.

Then again, perhaps he had thought too highly of his opponent. Compared to the Sword Assembly, the ranking battle wasn’t challenging. Lin Yun didn’t even use 50% of his strength, not to mention all the trump cards he had hidden.

“Lin Yun wins!” A judge from the Profound Azure Prefecture flew over and brought Zhang He down from the stage before he made the announcement.

“It has been tough on you, Lin Yun.” Ye Ziling nodded her head and wore a rare smile.

Lin Yun smiled when he heard that. In truth, he only used about 30% or 40% of his strength to defeat Zhang He. As long as the fight dragged on, Zhang He would lose. However, Lin Yun didn’t want to exhaust himself, so he finished things quickly.

If the Suspend King Palace or the Crimson Moon Elysium didn’t win fast enough, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect would have a bye round. So Lin Yun made sure he finished things quickly.

“That’s Xiahou Jue?” Lin Yun looked toward the Crimson Moon Elysium. Xiahou Jue arrived late, so Lin Yun wasn’t able to get a good look at him. So now when he looked at the Crimson Moon Elysium’s party, he was instantly captivated by this extraordinary black-clothed youth.

“Not him. That’s his junior brother, Zhao Chen. The one in white is Xiahou Jue,” said Ye Ziling while pointing at a person that Lin Yun didn’t take note of.

Lin Yun was surprised because this white-clothed youth gave a deep impression if anyone paid attention to him. When Lin Yun swept his gaze through the Crimson Moon Elysium’s party earlier, he had completely neglected this person. He would’ve recognized the wrong person if Ye Ziling didn’t correct him.

Lin Yun looked away and tried again. When he looked over at the Crimson Moon Elysium’s party once more, his face changed because he had neglected Xiahou Jue’s existence again. He needed to look twice to discover Xiahou Jue’s existence.

Lin Yun was baffled as to what Xiahou Jue did to make others neglect him. But he knew that Xiahou Jue didn’t do anything. When he looked at Xiahou Jue again, he could clearly sense the terrifying aura that Xiahou Jue was giving off.

Xiahou Jue was a terrifying opponent, and one would lose their lives if they weren’t careful. Just when Lin Yun was in deep thoughts, Xiahou Jue suddenly turned his head over with a smile.

Seeing Xiahou Jue’s smile, Lin Yun felt a chill run down his spine. Xiahou Jue clearly knew that Lin Yun was trying to examine him. Lin Yun realized why Xiahou Jue was the strongest genius of the Crimson Moon Elysium.

“The battle between the Suspend King Palace and Azure Thunder Monastery has begun.” Ye Ziling said, instantly diverting Lin Yun’s attention to the stage.

Although the two were pretty close in strength, the Suspend King Palace would be able to win if nothing went wrong. But when the fight started, the speed of the Azure Thunder Monastery’s defeat was a little shocking.

Clearly, the Azure Thunder Monastery wasn’t looking down on their opponent. It just so happened to be that the Suspend King Palace was incredibly strong. Both Chu Tianhao and the second senior disciple displayed terrifying strength, especially Chu Tianhao who practically defeated his opponent with a single move.

The monarch aura that he was giving off instantly crushed his opponent’s aura. It left Jiang Lichen and the others dumbfounded. They knew that if they really ran into the Suspend King Palace, everyone would probably fail aside from Lin Yun and Ye Ziling.

If they weren’t lucky and Lin Yun missed Chu Tianhao, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect would lose more terribly. But when the Crimson Moon Elysium went on the stage, their performance was even more shocking. They didn’t lose a single fight, unlike the Suspend King Palace who lost once.

Moreover, all of them had a terrifying crimson moon as their constellation. When the crimson moon appeared, an immense pressure would come crashing down. Xiahou Jue’s opponent immediately surrendered while the other participants from the Crimson Moon Elysium practically won their fight within ten moves.

Although the Thousand Crane Pavilion was practically the weakest force present, the complete dominance of the Crimson Moon Elysium was shocking. At the same time, everyone had a feeling that the landscape of the Profound Azure Prefecture would really change this time.

“Don’t tell me that the Profound Azure Prefecture will be a haven for demonic cultivators in the future?”

“It’s hard to say. After all, the Divine Dragon Empire has been closing an eye to the existence of demonic forces. In their eyes, the righteous and demonic forces have no difference.”

“Don’t think too much about it. The demonic forces are strong, to begin with. Otherwise, the Demon Domain would’ve been swept through by others a long time ago. But this time, the Crimson Moon Elysium is clearly here for the Sword Saint Mountain and the Divine Dragon Baptism!”

“Looks like this ranking battle will be very interesting. I wonder if the Suspend King Palace can bear the pressure.”

The audience was chatting in anticipation of the fight between the Suspend King Palace and the Crimson Moon Elysium. Clearly, no one had high hopes for the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. It was clear that aside from Lin Yun and maybe Ye Ziling, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect didn’t have an advantage against the Suspend King Palace.

If they were lucky, they might be able to get away with two losses. But if they weren’t lucky, they might lose four or five matches.

“The Crimson Moon Elysium won in the shortest amount of time. So the Suspend King Palace should be our opponent tomorrow,” said Jiang Lichen with his brows locked together.

Liu Qingyan, who also lost his match, spoke in a depressed tone, “Chu Tianhao is too strong, and not many people can stand before his Suspend King Art.”

“I don’t see it that way,” said Lin Yun. “The Suspend King Palace only has Chu Tianhao and Qin Yang. The other three are merely in the pinnacle Astral Stage. In terms of strength, they’re not that scary.”

“You have a way to deal with them?” Ye Ziling’s eyes lit up because she could sense the hidden meaning in Lin Yun’s words.

“We’ll talk when we go back,” said Lin Yun as he looked at everyone calculating the time each force took. Although he could roughly guess that the Crimson Moon Elysium took the shortest amount of time, the Profound Azure Prefecture still had to conduct a calculation for fairness.

Soon enough, someone from the Profound Azure Prefecture stood up and gave each force their times. After the representative left, Ye Ziling looked at everyone and said, “The Crimson Moon Elysium will directly proceed to the next round.”

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun left while everyone looked at him. They had no idea what Lin Yun was planning.

The Suspend King Palace also left, but they weren’t looking very happy. They naturally didn’t place the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect in their eyes and were instead concerned about Xiahou Jue.

After all, the strength that Xiahou Jue displayed was too strong and they didn’t think that they could come up with a plan in just one night.

Meanwhile, Yan Tie and Luo Hua were at a place that Lin Yun would never imagine. They were in the Azure Rock County City.

“Only that old geezer from the Feng Clan is left.” Luo Hua said coldly while she looked at the Feng Clan’s Hidden Sword Pavilion.

“He’s the only one left,” smiled Yan Tie. He had witnessed how decisive this Young Master Luo was in killing all nine Dragon Pulse Realm experts who surrounded Lin Yun back then.

Although he had doubts in his heart, Yan Tie didn’t dare to ask because he could feel a chill in his spine the longer he interacted with Luo Hua. His wits told him to keep his mouth shut and just do as he was told.
