Chapter 2014 - Cocky (2)

“Take it!” Xin Yan gritted her teeth and handed the Divine Blood Flower over. This was a dazzling crimson flower, emitting a bewitching radiance that instantly captivated everyone.

Jin Xuanyi swiftly stowed the Divine Blood Flower and smiled, “As expected of the Profound Maiden Miao Yin, hahaha!”

Jin Xuanyi laughed and left after gulping down the wine in his cup.

But Xin Yan hovered in the air with purple ribbons around her. She coldly said, “I only said I’d hand the Divine Blood Flower over to you, but I didn’t say that I permitted you to leave!”

“You want to stop me?” Jin Xuanyi squinted his pupils. He casually smiled, “Truth be told, I don’t wish to fight you because your master’s notorious name is even more frightening than the Heavenly Dao Sect.”

“Senior Sister Miao Yin, don’t fight him,” Wang Yue said.

“There’s something weird about him, and you’re probably not his opponent!” Wang Muyan said with lingering fear, her face pale.

At this moment, several powerful auras swept out from the treehouse inn. There were rumbling lightning, phoenix cries, saint runes, and various phenomena. This was because the leaders of the five holy lands stood up and locked onto Jin Xuanyi. At this moment, everyone discovered that the six holy lands had long gathered here.

So even without Jin Xuanyi, it wouldn’t be easy for the Heavenly Dao Sect’s party to leave.

“Jin Xuanyi, you want to leave with the Divine Blood Flower? Aren’t you looking down on us, the six holy lands?”

“Even if you’re first on the King Ranking, who gave you the confidence to do so?”

“We have long informed our sects, and it won’t take long for our sects’ Saint Elders to come and fetch us!”

“Even if you can leave the treehouse inn, you won’t be able to leave the God Burial Woods!” Cold voices emerged. They were all ranked in the top ten of the King Ranking.

But Jin Xuanyi had a fearless smile, “What’s the matter? Don’t tell me the six holy lands have fallen, so you guys must join forces. I don’t believe that Saint Realm experts would make a move against a junior like me. Even if I die, the reputation of those Saint Realm experts could become foul!”

Jin Xuanyi was fearless and arrogant. He was fearless as he faced the six holy lands, and this made everyone shocked.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“You can try and leave the treehouse inn, then!” A saint disciple said, looking at Jin Xuanyi. Even if they had to gang up on Jin Xuanyi, they wouldn’t allow him to leave with the Divine Blood Flower.

Jin Xuanyi’s face became dark, as if he was scheming something. He mocked, “I never expected that the holy lands would fall this far. I’m determined to obtain the Divine Blood Flower. I’ll stay in the Six Holy City for a month and give the Divine Blood Flower to whoever can defeat me at the Six Holy Arena!”

“Don’t tell me the six holy lands fear me, Jin Xuanyi! Hahaha! I’ll be going now, so let me see who dares to launch a sneak attack on me!” As Jin Xuanyi laughed, he picked up a jar of wine and openly left the treehouse inn.

The six holy lands were shocked by him, but no one dared to make a move against Jin Xuanyi.

“Chase after him and see if he’s going to the Six Holy City!” The faces of the five holy land’s disciples changed, and quickly chased after Jin Xuanyi.

A long time later, an uproar burst out from the treehouse inn.

“As expected of Jin Xuanyi, he’s really strong!”

“It doesn’t matter if he’s strong, but no one can beat him in demeanor. None of the six holy lands dared to let out a fart before him.”

“Haha, there’s a show to watch now! Jin Xuanyi deserves his reputation to be ranked first on the King ranking!”

“I don’t think Jin Xuanyi’s objective is the Divine Blood Flower. He was probably waiting for this moment, instead of entering the Quasi-Saint Realm. He wanted to use the six holy lands’ geniuses to nurture his invincible demeanor. He is determined to appear on the Blue Dragon Record when he enters the Quasi-Saint Realm.”

“That’s most probably the case. Jin Xuanyi is really as strong as rumored to suppress the six holy lands.” The faces of cultivators within the treehouse inn turned red with excitement.

Jin Xuanyi’s performance today made all the wandering cultivators look up to him. After all, the six holy lands’ disciples were well-known for their strengths and could easily suppress wandering cultivators like them. This was also why they didn’t dare to say a word when Wang Muyan mocked them earlier.

But Jin Xuanyi easily suppressed the six holy lands, playing with them in his hands, not to mention he was cocky and arrogant.

“Senior Sister Xin Yan, what should we do now?” Chen Zhong asked with his face ugly.

The Heavenly Dao Sect definitely suffered the most grievances during this incident than the rest of the six holy lands. They were prideful as disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect, but they suffered a huge blow today.

Xin Yan’s face was changing because everything happened too quickly. She could feel that something wasn’t right, but she couldn’t tell where the problem was, and she also didn’t know what to do now.

“I’m not his opponent with my current cultivation, even if I fight him in the arena. We won’t be able to get the Divine Blood Flower back,” Xin Yan calmly analyzed. “Not to mention Senior Brother Nangong is injured.”

Everyone fell into silence because what Xin Yan said was the truth. Jin Xuanyi was too strong, and he was too unfathomable. They really couldn’t find a word to describe Jin Xuanyi.

“I know someone who can seize the Divine Blood Flower back!” Wang Muyan suddenly spoke up.

“Who is it?” Everyone quickly turned to look at Wang Muyan, including Xin Yan.

“Ye Qingtian! He’s currently within the Myriad Graves Valley!” Wang Muyan said seriously.

Everyone was initially filled with anticipation, waiting for Wang Muyan’s answer. But when they heard what he said, their faces sank. Ye Qingtian was truly formidable, but he was only at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. None of them thought he could make it into the top hundredth on the King Ranking.

He might be able to suppress Jin Xuanyi in another two years. After all, he was a genius swordsman, and his strength would drastically transform when his cultivation increased. So no one underestimated him. But they didn’t think he could win a fight against Jin Xuanyi in his current cultivation.

“Forget about it. If Ye Qingtian is killed by Jin Xuanyi, Martial Uncle Dragon Origin will probably go crazy.”

“Not to mention he doesn’t have a good reputation, and everyone would probably mock us if he went on the arena.”

“Yeah… The Nether Orchid Holy Maiden left because of him, and who doesn’t know that he’s…” Upon mentioning Ye Qingtian, the surrounding saint disciples immediately had a huge opinion against him.

“His cultivation is too low, and it’s not appropriate for him to get involved in this matter,” Xin Yan rejected.

“But what if he finds the Udumbara Flower?” Wan Muyan asked.

Everyone was briefly stunned. They didn’t know why Wang Muyan was so concerned about Ye Qingtian.

“We can’t give up as long as there’s an opportunity. I’m the cause of this matter, so I’ll look for him in the Myriad Graves Valley. We’re acquaintances, and I believe he’ll help me!” Wang Muyan had guilt on her face as she pushed everyone away and disappeared.

Wang Yue was shocked when he saw Wang Muyan leave so quickly. Wasn’t she injured? Why could she leave so easily?

Xin Yan’s face also changed because she felt something was wrong with Wang Muyan.
