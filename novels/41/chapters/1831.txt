Chapter 1832 - Three God Generals

Lin Yun and An Liuyan traveled through the barren land, carefully avoiding the various dangers along the way. This place was dangerous, and they would lose their lives here if they weren’t careful.

A shocking scene appeared when they crossed the barren land. An Liuyan was surprised and too shocked to say anything. It was a spectacular scene that couldn’t be described with any words, there was a majestic statue reaching ten thousand feet. The statue’s hand was raised to the sky, and it seemed to be lifting something to the sky.

The ground was covered with white bones, but no one could recognize if they belonged to the demonspirits, human cultivators, or Black Tortoise’s descendants. The bones were rotten and boundless, looking like an ocean of bones. The bone sea covered the statue’s waist, and everyone could feel their scalps going numb while looking at it. No one could imagine how many people died at that time.

When Lin Yun and An Liuyan descended from the sky, Gu Jun and Mei Zihua quickly followed behind them after discovering that the other two were far away amidst their astonishment. Mei Zihua raised his head and asked in shock, “Oh my god. Is this a person or a statue? Isn’t this a little too terrifying?”

“This is a forbidden technique of the Eight-Nine Divine Art, Celestial Body, the pinnacle of all body-refining techniques. This might be the palace lord, Black Thunder Martial Emperor.” Gu Jun sighed.

Eight-Nine Divine Art? The Eight-Nine Divine Art had a total of seventy-two transformations, and Lin Yun’s Divine Tortoise Transformation was just one of them. So if it was really the forbidden technique of the Eight-Nine Divine Art, it might really be able to achieve something as horrifying as this.

As Gu Jun spoke, he suddenly became quiet with sorrow filling his pupils. He had also shown this expression when he fought with the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit before. He fell onto his knees and gave three kowtows in the direction of the statue.

No one said a word. When he got up, Mei Zihua asked, “Senior Gu, what’s the matter?”

“You see that sea of bones? They’re practically all descendants of the Black Tortoise’s lineage, but they’re all controlled by the Demonspirit Clan with a demonic aura. The Black Thunder Martial Emperor was forced to resort to the forbidden technique to protect the Black Tortoise Saint Palace, killing all his fellow clansmen along with the Demonspirit Clan.” Gu Jun sobbed.

Lin Yun became silent when he heard that, and couldn’t help looking at the statue with respect. After all, who could’ve imagined that the Black Tortoise Clan declined because of this? This also showed how brutal the battle was for the Black Thunder Martial Emperor to have no other choice but to kill his fellow clansmen as well.

“Young Master, the Black Thunder Saint Palace should still be there.” An Liuyan said.

When Lin Yun looked in the direction An Liuyan pointed out, he saw lightning flickering from the Black Thunder Martial Emperor’s palm, and he could faintly see a majestic palace over there.

“Let’s go. I’m afraid someone has already noticed the palace.” Gu Jun recollected his thoughts and sighed.

They didn’t hesitate to soar to the sky, breaking through the thunderclouds and coming to the palm of the Black Thunder Martial Emperor. His hand was like an endless plain, and this was because there was a Space Saint Rune engraved on the palm, and the Black Thunder Saint Palace was located on the palm.

There were over a thousand people gathered on the palm, and they were all emitting powerful auras. With just a glance, anyone could tell that they were mostly all cultivators at the fourth stage Profound Life Stage, and there were even old men at the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage.

The various holy land geniuses were also around. The Heavenly Dao Sect’s Xiao Yuanqi, Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Ji Lingfeng, Heavenly Flame Sect’s Chi Yanhuo, Ming Cult’s Yu Wenxiu, Myriad Lightning Sect’s Yi Feng, and Divine Dao Sect’s Lin Qingyang were all here. Aside from that, there were also many seniors who sealed their cultivation to come here, and they were all on the same level as Gu Jun.

But no one dared to carelessly make a move and their eyes were glued to the palace’s entrance. It was a massive bronze gate.

When Lin Yun’s party descended from the sky, their presence instantly attracted everyone’s attention. That was especially the case for Lin Yun, who was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“He’s not dead!” The faces of Kou Tianhua’s group of three sank when they discovered Lin Yun’s presence. Kou Tianhua wanted to secretly follow Lin Yun, but he shrunk back when he saw the commotion created by the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

After all, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was practically invincible in the lightning pool, and that gave him a huge phobia. If they caught the attention of that monster, there was no way they could survive, even if they had nine lives.

“How did he manage to get rid of the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit? He’s actually still alive?!” Yuan Hengying and Lady Stone were also surprised. After all, they had personally sensed the terrifying demonic aura from afar, and they were certain that Lin Yun would die a terrible death. This was the reason why they didn’t go over to take a look.

It was natural for the three of them to be shocked upon seeing Lin Yun alive and well. Not far away, Yu Wenxiu was also surprised when he saw Lin Yun. The latter was clearly only at the Dragon Pulse Realm, so how was he alive?

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t place their gazes in his heart.

They would’ve never expected that not only was Lin Yun alive, but his strength also underwent a great transformation. Not only did his nine dragon pulses reach twenty-three thousand feet, but the number of golden-purple and blue-jade dragon runes also grew to one hundred and ten thousand. Not to mention he had obtained a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact. Even before entering the Black Thunder Saint Palace, Lin Yun’s harvest had far exceeded everyone else’s. But that wasn’t all. He was still left with eighteen saint-grade Black Tortoise Cores.

“Lin Xiao, come over here!” Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi called out to Lin Yun when they saw him. The demonic cultivators who could come here were all experts on the Demonic Ranking, and Lin Yun still had a Demonfeather Order bounty on his head. Since both of them had a good relationship with Lin Yun, they naturally wanted to help him.

“Let’s head on over.” Lin Yun didn’t refuse and walked in their direction.

When An Liuyan saw Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi, she asked, “Why didn’t you guys go into the Black Tortoise Saint Palace?”

There were over a thousand people gathered on the palm of the Black Thunder Martial Emperor, and there was no shortage of ruthless people. Not everyone here would put the holy lands in their eyes, and one had to be a saint disciple at the bare minimum to intimidate them.

“There’s a lightning barrier enveloping the palace. We all tried what we could, but we were still unable to break it open. So we can only wait and see if anything will happen.” Ji Lingfeng explained.

“How long will we have to wait? Any rough estimation?”

“Maybe ten days or half a month. We might even have to wait for a month. But the Black Thunder Saint Palace is right before us, so we can afford to wait.” Xiao Yuanqi smiled.

When An Liuyan heard those words, she finally knew what was going on. When she looked at the Black Thunder Saint Palace, there was a screen layer covering the bronze gate, and it was covered with lightning runes. But the screen was just as Xiao Yuanqi had said, it was slowly dissipating.

Before the bronze gate, there were some fresh corpses lying in front of it. Taking a rough look at it, Lin Yun noticed that this barrier wasn’t as strong as he had imagined, and many people here had the strength to break it. But the risk was too great, and no one wanted to expose their trump cards. This was the reason why everyone would rather wait for it to disappear.

As time passed, more experts began to gather, and this place gradually became more bustling. This made everyone gradually run out of patience. After all, if more people entered, the competition would be even more intense. No one wished to see more people entering the palace.

“Everyone, I have an idea that might be able to let us enter the Black Thunder Saint Palace in advance.” Kou Tianhua said, rolling his eyes. This made everyone’s eyes light up, and they couldn’t help looking at him.

“Kou Tianhua, don’t beat around the bush. If you have a way to let us enter in advance, we will surely give you face when we compete for treasures!” Someone said.

“If the Nirvana Banquet’s champion, Lin Xiao, is willing to make a move, he can surely break the screen. His cultivation might be low, but the sharpness of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent isn’t something we can imagine.” Kou Tianhua smiled.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“That does really seem to be the case!”

“Sword intent is sharper than other martial intents, and it can even cut space apart. So if he’s willing to make a move, there’s a high chance that he can succeed.” Many people agreed with what Kou Tianhua said.

Ji Lingfeng’s face sank, and he coldly said, “Kou Tianhua, shut your mouth. Do you want Lin Xiao to die? Even if he can break apart the barrier, he won’t be able to bear the backlash of the Black Thunder Sacred Flame. Even those at the fifth stage Profound Life Stage died!”

“Ha. This isn’t a place a Dragon Pulse Realm like him should come to, and he deserves it even if he dies.” Kou Tianhua sneered. “Not to mention he still has the Demonfeather Order on his head. Does he really think he can survive within the Black Thunder Saint Palace? Does he still have a chance of survival? At that time, let me see if you guys can still protect him. If he can make contributions now, we might consider letting him live for a while longer.”

“He can give it a try.” Yu Wenxiu smiled. As one of the holy land geniuses, the situation instantly became bizarre, since he stood on Kou Tianhua’s side.

From the side, the Heavenly Flame Sect’s Yan Chihuo briefly pondered before he smiled, “If Brother Lin is willing to help, this screen shouldn’t be a problem for him. After all, we have all witnessed the strength of Lin Yun’s sword intent at the Martial Dao Tea Party.”

In that instant, all the holy land geniuses directed their attention to Lin Yun. This made Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng feel great pressure because those people were too shameless. They were all jealous of Lin Yun’s strength and wanted him to die here while making use of him to open the Black Thunder Saint Palace.

Lin Yun’s face sank, while coldly looking at Kou Tianhua. This person was really getting on his nerves.

“Lin Xiao, hurry up!” Kou Tianhua roared.

“Just because you’re the disciple of the Whitebone Blade Saint? Who the hell do you think you are to order me?” Lin Yun coldly replied. He couldn’t be bothered to be polite with his tone. Since Kou Tianhua was courting death, he would just fulfill the latter’s wish. People tended to bully those who were weaker than them, but did they really think he was a pushover just because he was at the Dragon Pulse Realm?

“Then, what use do we have for you?” Kou Tianhua squinted his eyes. He was still worried that he wouldn’t have an opportunity to kill Lin Yun.

Right then, three figures descended from the sky. These three people wore playful smiles as they examined the holy land geniuses. Lin Yun was the first to detect those three with his Sword Heart, and this made his brows lock together. He was familiar with the two God Generals. They were the two whom he had defeated at the Martial Dao Tea Party.

But there was still another person standing amongst them, and he was donned in a golden-crimson robe with cold flames blazing in the depths of his pupils, making him seem eerie. This person should be the strongest of the three God Generals, the Fire God General.

This made Lin Yun’s face slightly change, and he wore a playful expression. Since the three God Generals were here, it wasn’t his turn to stand out.

“The three God Generals are here!”

“Who knows if they’ve already been here a long time and have been waiting here.” Everyone had fear lingering within their pupils when they saw the three God Generals. The three wore a Nethermoon Saint Armor, and were far stronger than many people. That was especially the case for the Fire God General, who had long reached the Profound Life Stage.

When their gazes fell onto those three, the Fire God General sneered, “Is this how far the Eastern Desolation has fallen? A mere screen layer and you guys have to force someone at the Dragon Pulse Realm to deal with it? I can deal with it myself!”
