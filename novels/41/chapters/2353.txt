Chapter 2354 - Peerless Beauties

Ji Zixi obtained five Golden Dao Fruits, and she still had three. She stood out when she saw the two of them provoking Lin Yun.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly because Ji Zixi was a little too naive, and he wasn’t afraid of these two. But it didn’t matter as he didn’t mind playing.

Shangguan Jue and Zhao Zhanli’s eyes lit up with joy when they saw this. The Flame Origin Pellets might be previous, but it was inferior compared to the Golden Dao Fruit.

Zhao Zhanli said, “Flower Burial, what do you have to say now?”

Lin Yun smiled, “I never said that I’m not going to bet, but these two aren’t enough.”

Shangguan Jue smiled, “Go on.”

“If I lose, I’ll give you guys a Golden Dao Fruit. But if you lose, you have to give me ten Flame Dao Fruits,” Lin Yun said with a smile.

Zhao Zhanli and Shangguan Jue were stumped because they only had five Flame Origin Pellets. But Shangguan Jue pondered briefly, and he said, “Okay. I’ll agree with you.”

They weren’t the only ones from the Shadow Divine Palace, and it was possible to gather ten Flame Origin Pellets. The courage that he showed even shocked Zhao Zhanli.

“But I have to set a deadline. Let’s go for three days. Three days later, we will comprehend the cauldron together,” Shangguan Jue said, looking at Lin Yun.

“Brother Shangguan seemed to be confident,” Lin Yun smiled.

“It’s nothing. After all, you grasped the Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent, and I still have some pressure,” Shangguan Jue smiled.

Lin Yun pondered, and he said, “Alright. Let’s go with that then.”

Seeing that Lin Yun agreed to it, Shangguan Jue no longer hid it, and he smiled, “It’s a pity that this isn’t only tested on Sword Dao. Otherwise, I would lose. But now...”

He didn’t say anything and only laughed before leaving with Zhao Zhanli. He approached the Shadow Divine Palace’s gathering and shared his intentions. But the disciples of the Shadow Divine Palace became nervous. After all, the Flame Origin Pellet was previous, and losing one would make them feel heartache.

“Don’t worry about it. We won’t lose,” Shangguan Jue said. “Without absolute confidence, I wouldn’t dare to bet with him.”

Back to Lin Yun, everyone was nervous because Shangguan Jue wouldn’t have made that bet if he wasn’t confident.

“It looks like they came prepared,” Ao Jue squinted.

Xiong Tiannan said, “That fellow seems pretty polite, but I have a feeling that he’s even tougher to deal with than Gu Jun.”

“They’re just acting, and they probably won't continue acting if they win Big Brother Lin,” Ji Zixi said.

Lin Yun merely smiled because what they said was right, especially the opinion from Xiong Tiannan. Shangguan Jue wasn’t that arrogant, but there was no way he could hide the pride in his bones.

“How confident are you?” Lin Jiangxian asked.

“Not sure about it...” Lin Yun smiled.

“Ah? You don’t know?” Everyone was shocked, especially Ao Jue, who looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. He smiled bitterly, “As expected of you.”

“Let’s have some fun then,” Lin Yun said honestly. He was speaking the truth because even if he didn’t use the Nirvana Dao, he didn’t know if it would be as heaven-defying as he did with the Sovereign Monument. After all, the cauldron itself represented primal chaos.

Lin Yun and Shangguan Jue might seem calm, but everyone in the surroundings has already discussed them.

“Shangguan Jue really made his move.”

“That’s normal because Lin Yun stole his limelight.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“It’s time to teach Lin Yun a lesson, who even dared to dig into the saint origins of Divine Clan’s disciples. He’s lucky that this is the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain. If it were the outside world, he would’ve been dead. Did he really think that no one in the universe could handle him?”

“Even Flower Burial didn’t know the odds for him.”

“Shangguan Jue came prepared!”

“Isn’t that obvious? Shangguan Jue isn’t a fool, especially after witnessing Lin Yun’s strength.”

“That fellow is here to embarrass Lin Yun, purposely choosing the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron.”

The factions were divided into two as those from Divine Clans and immortal holy lands stood on Shangguan Jue’s side. As for Lin Yun, he had the support of countless swordsmen, but they looked worried. It was mainly because Shangguan Jue was cunning, and he didn’t provoke Lin Yun like Gu Jun and others. Someone like him was harder to deal with.

As time passed, the discussion slowly ended, with everyone’s attention on the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. After all, everyone paid great attention to this test. Two days later, more people began to try, but there weren’t many who could discover nine phenomena. Some couldn’t even find one.

There were occasionally those that found nine, but the grey-clothed elder shook his head and didn’t seem satisfied. But as more people tried, everyone also knew that comprehending the phenomena in the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron had nothing to do with time.

When Zhao Zhanli tried to comprehend from the cauldron, everyone’s eyes lit up. Zhao Zhanli sat above the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, and he saw thirty-six phenomena when he opened his eyes that looked majestic. Most importantly, those phenomena could even intertwine, and this performance even drew the grey-clothed elder’s attention.

Zhao Zhanli smiled as he waved his hand to summon those phenomena, which manifested into thirty-six paintings. When everyone settled down, indigo mist rose from the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, and a fist-sized pellet appeared with a dragon engraved on it.

“The Divine Dragon Destiny Pellet!” Zhao Zhanli’s eyes lit up.

“As expected of the Shadow Divine Palace’s divine disciple, Your master is the Nine Wood God, right?” The grey-clothed youth asked.

“That’s right. Senior, you must be the Profound Sky Venerable of the thirty-six divine envoys of the Heaven’s Gate,” Zhao Zhanli smiled.

Heaven’s Gate had thirty-six divine envoys, and they were known as venerable.

The Profound Sky Venerable nodded with a smile.

Everyone became envious seeing this. At the same time, a commotion sounded from the surroundings as Zhao Zhanli found thirty-six phenomena, so how terrifying was Shangguan Jue?

“The Shadow Divine Palace’s divine disciples are pretty impressive.” Xiong Tiannan was shocked, and he looked at Ao Jue, “How much did you find?”

He had concern in his tone because he only found seven to eight, and he wasn’t proficient in comprehension. This meant that he might be eliminated in this round.

“It shouldn’t be a problem for me to make it through the test,” Ao Jue replied.

Xiong Tiannan’s heart clenched, and he looked at Lin Jiangxian, shutting his mouth just when he wanted to ask. Since Ao Jue could make it through the test, it shouldn’t be a problem for Lin Jiangxian. He asked, “Ji Zixi, what about you?”

Ji Zixi frowned, and she said, “I’m not too sure.”

Xiong Tiannan naturally wouldn’t believe Ji Zixi as he had witnessed how proficient she was in concealing herself.

Right then, Lin Yun opened his eyes. This brought joy to Xiong Tiannan’s face, and he asked, “Big Brother, how many phenomena did you find? Help me!”

“Don’t panic. It doesn’t matter how much you find now,” Lin Yun smiled.

“What do you mean?” Xiong Tiannan asked.

Lin Yun looked at the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, and he said, “Looking at it from afar is the same as looking through a glass. It’s hard to see through the Eternal Sand, and you can only find some traces. But you don’t have to be worried. You just have to release your comprehension of your physique when you go on it and just charge. To someone like you, you have a higher advantage in a test like this.”

Xiong Tiannan asked, “What about you? Are you confident?”

“You’ll know at that time,” Lin Yun smiled. He closed his eyes and began to comprehend. As he had expected, the Nirvana Dao was useless, and there was even a backlash. When he executed Nirvana Dao, the primal chaos became even more firm. But just when Lin Yun wanted to use his Sword Dao, he saw many scenes as paintings began to open up.

This instantly allowed him to understand all the profundity. This test wasn’t on comprehension, as the primal chaos might seem hard to break through, but it was actually a mirror. The primal chaos wasn’t from the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron but from his heart.

“Let’s go and give it a try.” Lin Jiangxian stood up and gave Ji Zixi an invitation, which Ji Zixi followed with a smile. Ao Jue also wore a smile and followed behind them. As for Xiong Tiannan, he was still pondering what Lin Yun said. He wasn’t too confident in himself, and he could only follow behind since they had already gone over, and their action drew everyone’s attention.

“Lin Jiangxian’s group is going to give it a try!”

“But Lin Yun hasn’t moved.”

“They’re monstrous geniuses, and none of them were in a disadvantageous position fighting the Divine Clans, not to mention that there was a Heavenly Phoenix Maiden with them.”

“They’re really beautiful!” Many people’s attention was on Lin Jiangxian and Ji Zixi. Lin Jiangxian was heroic, while Ji Zixi was charming.

“It has finally begun.” Zhao Zhanli smiled as he wanted to see their performance to gauge Lin Yun’s strength. When he looked at Lin Jiangxian and Ji Zixi, he said enviously, “He’s really fortunate.”
