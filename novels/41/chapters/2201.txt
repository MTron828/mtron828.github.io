Chapter 2202: Shock

Wang Muyan and Zhao Tianyu’s faces changed with uncertainty as they looked at the person hovering in the sky shrouded in dazzling silver radiance that covered her true appearance. Only the divinity that she gave off was dazzling, as well as her silver long hair.

“The Heavenly Slaughter Empress?” Zhao Tianyu and Wang Muyan exchanged a gaze. There were many Emperors in the Kunlun Realm aside from the Nine Emperors, but they had never heard of the Heavenly Slaughter Empress before, not to mention that this title was a little too long.

What the hell was with the Divine Phoenix Clan, then? The Divine Phoenix Clan was ancient, and all the pure-blooded divine beasts had left a long time ago. Since then, they never showed themselves in the world. They left the Kunlun Realm like the deities, and many of them have long become legends. But even if this Heavenly Slaughter Empress was fake, she did repel the White Dew Saint Sovereign with a palm.

Gu Xinyu anxiously asked, “Divine Son, what should we do now? With her stopping us, we can no longer catch up with Ye Qingtian. If we still don’t make a move, we won’t be able to obtain the Solar Lunar Divine Rune.”

Lin Yun and Bai Shuying were already far away, and they wouldn’t be able to catch up with them soon.

“I have taken a liking to the thing beneath the Celestial Pool, so leave here immediately. Otherwise, no one can save you if I become furious,” Lil’ Purple’s cold voice resounded. As she spoke, terrifying lightning ripped across the horizon with each lightning bolt engraved with ancient runes.

Aside from lightning, there were also terrifying gales that caused the clouds in the sky to rumble with the lightning becoming increasingly terrifying. At this moment, lightning and wind intertwined, and it looked as though an apocalypse was arriving.

This made everyone feel their scalps going numb, especially Zhao Tianyu. Since he possessed the Divine Lightning Eye, he was sensitive to lightning. Even if he circulated the Divine Lightning Eye to the limit, he couldn’t unleash lightning of this level, and the golden bolts of lightning were too ancient.

“Let’s retreat for now. This person probably has a huge origin, so we’ll wait for the sect master,” Zhao Tianyu said with fear flashing through his eyes.

Gu Xinyu heaved a sigh of relief and was a little intimidated by this scene. He was afraid that Zhao Tianyu would want him to probe this person’s strength.

“What you see may not be true,” Wang Muyan’s gaze calmed down. If this person was that powerful, why would Ye Qingtian leave in such a hurry and even wanted to ask for her opinion?

“Senior, sorry about this.” As the golden and silver radiance shone on Wang Muyan, a blood moon bloomed in her eyes, before she appeared in front of Lil’ Purple. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You’re courting death!” Lil’ Purple snorted as she waved her hand and sent Wang Muyan flying away.

Wang Muyan wiped the blood off her lips as a faint smile rose on her lips.

“This is a small punishment, and I’ll kill you if you dare to offend me again,” Lil’ Purple said coldly.

Wang Muyan smiled, “Senior, you must be joking. If you’re an Emperor, you could easily kill me with a palm, and I would be deaf before I could make a move.”

Zhao Tianyu who had already intended on retreating suddenly became doubtful, and said, “White Dew.”

“Understood.” The White Dew Saint Sovereign also noticed that something wasn’t right.

But this scene made Lil’ Purple’s heart sink because she knew that things weren’t optimistic on her side, so she coldly said, “A bunch of juniors. I’ll kill your sect master first before coming after you guys!”

She was only able to be so powerful by relying on the two divine runes. If she fought with a Saint Sovereign, it wouldn’t take long before she revealed her true self.

Before White Dew made a move, Lil’ Purple had already left.

Seeing that White Dew wanted to catch up with Lil’ Purple, Wang Muyan called out, “Don’t bother. You may not even be able to gain any advantage even if you defeated her, and she has an ancient aura on her.”

As she spoke, Wang Muyan threw out a mouthful of blood because her injuries were more serious than they looked.

“Are you alright?” Zhao Tianyu came over with a frown.

“I don’t need your concern,” Wang Muyan said unhappily as she turned her head away and headed over to the Celestial Pool.

Zhao Tianyu smiled bitterly because he had finally calmed down now, and knew that he had lost his composure earlier. If it was during the usual times, he wouldn’t be bothered with Ye Qingtian and Bai Shuying because the Solar Lunar Divine Rune was more important.

“Divine Son.” The White Dew Saint Sovereign came over and held onto Zhao Tianyu’s chin before feeding him a saint pellet. This was the Blooming Wither Pellet, a top-tiered elixir used for treating injuries. As long as Zhao Tianyu wasn’t dead, he could swiftly recover from his injuries.

“How does it feel getting beaten up?” The White Dew Saint Sovereign asked.

Zhao Tianyu smiled, “I have underestimated him.”

He knew that Ye Qingtian had a powerful sword technique, but he didn’t expect that the Light of the Beginning was just the opening.

“Let’s go.” Zhao Tianyu was clad in saint aura as he recovered from his injuries, and swiftly caught up with Wang Muyan.

“Over here.” Wang Muyan pointed at the Celestial Pool, and said, “The Solar Lunar Divine Rune is sealed here, but the seal is hard to break. If we do it forcibly, the Divine Rune might self-destruct.”

Looking at Zhao Tianyu with mistrust, she asked, “Where’s the person you’ve invited?”

“He’s already here. He has always been here. Come out,” Zhao Tianyu smiled.

“Haha!” Hearty laughter resounded after Zhao Tianyu’s words, and a person clad in saint radiance and saint runes appeared.

Seeing this person, Wang Muyan was surprised as she exclaimed, “Holy Spirit Son!”

This newcomer was the mysterious Holy Spirit Son of the Heavenly Dao Sect. This surprised Wang Muyan because she didn’t expect that the Holy Spirit Son to be a member of the Demonspirit Clan, and it was terrifying ti think about it. According to her information, the Holy Spirit Son had a deep relationship with the Thousand Plume Great Saint.

It was no wonder why that Zhao Tianyu was so confident. The Holy Spirit Son’s attainment in spiritual runes could be considered to be the strongest within the Heavenly Dao Sect. Even most of the saints couldn’t be compared to him.

“Divine Son, Divine Maiden.” The Holy Spirit Son looked humble as he bowed with a smile.

Wang Muyan mocked, “I never expected the famous Holy Spirit Son to be a member of the Demonspirit Clan.”

The Holy Spirit Son wasn’t enraged by Wang Muyan’s tone, but smiled, “Since the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden can be the Blood Moon Divine Maiden, why can’t I

be a member of the Demonspirit Clan?”

Noticing that the situation wasn’t right, Zhao Tianyu changed the topic, “Now isn’t the time to talk about this. Regardless of the Blood Moon Sect or the Demonspirit Clan, we all need to undo the seal on the God Burial Mountain Range. The Solar Lunar Divine Rune is here, and we’re only one step away. So please cooperate.”

The Holy Spirit Son nodded, “Please split this Celestial Pool apart. Although your sect’s sect master is here, it’s best not to delay this any further.”

Zhao Tianyu looked at the White Dew Saint Sovereign, who waved her hand and unleashed her saint aura at the Celestial Pool. It didn’t take long for the water in the pool to gush out and turn into a downpour. This was a shocking scene since it wasn’t easy to accomplish this feat, even for a Saint Sovereign.

Far away, Lin Yun and Bai Shuying saw this scene when they turned around.

“They have already started,” Bai Shuying said with concern as they landed on a mountain. She continued, “The Divine Rune is in there. They really came here for it.”

“I know, but we should leave this place,” Lin Yun said. He could sense the fluctuation coming from the Celestial Pool, but he was more concerned about his senior brother’s condition right now. They could already see Ye Guhan fighting with that red-clothed youth, and the situation wasn’t optimistic since Ye Guhan had summoned seven swords, allowing his sword intent to multiply by seven times.

But Ye Guhan wasn’t able to suppress the red-clothed youth, no matter how he tried, because the latter was too terrifying despite looking young. He seemed to be more experienced than he looked.

“You knew?” Bai Shuying asked in a surprised tone.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned. He didn’t notice Bai Shuying’s state, but he nodded, “I did.”

“Damn it! They’re going after the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, and there’s nothing I can do about it.” Lil’ Purple returned to her little girl form as she landed beside Lin Yun and Bai Shuying. But the moment she spoke, she immediately sensed that something wasn’t right.

This was because Bai Shuying was staring at her since she had injured this little girl back then, and she was together with Ye Qingtian. She asked, “The two of you were here for the Solar Lunar Divine Rune right from the beginning?”

Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple exchanged a gaze, and he said, “This is complicated. But believe me that I have no ill intentions.”

Bai Shuying bit on her lips, and her hands began to tremble. She said with great difficulty, “I naturally know that you have no ill intentions against me. So… you’re not Ye Qingtian, right?”

Lin Yun was stunned as he looked at Bai Shuying with shock. He could notice that something wasn’t right with her right now. Recalling what happened at the ceremony and Bai Shuying’s gaze, had she discovered his identity?

Lin Yun sighed because he really didn’t want to disclose his identity now. But just when he was about to speak, a loud boom echoed and Ye Guhan threw out a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground. The seven mountains he summoned had shattered and he lost his support, which made him lie on the ground.

“Let’s talk about this later!” Lin Yun said anxiously.

Bai Shuying also noticed this situation, and hid her emotions as she flew over to the Nether Orchid Courtyard with Lin Yun.

Looking at their figures, Lil’ Purple sighed, “Don’t tell me that the person Bai Shuying was waiting for is this scumbag, right?”

The moment she thought that, everything became clear, and she now knew why Bai Shuying’s emotions were so complicated. But she had no idea when Lin Yun won her heart.

“You’re pale compared to the Radiant Sword Saint. Back then, his Great Profound Sword Canon was enough to suppress me when I hadn’t become an Emperor,” the red-clothed youth basked in the crimson moonlight as he looked down at Ye Guhan.

Ye Guhan wiped the blood off his lips, and smiled, “I have experienced the strength of the Blood Moon Sect’s sect master.”

The red-clothed youth had no expression on his face as he asked, “Since you have admitted defeat, why aren’t you submitting to me? Or are you forcing me to start a massacre?”

“Admit defeat?” Ye Guhan smiled. “I haven’t lost as long as I can still breathe. Furthermore, this is only a clone of yours, so why do I have to admit defeat?”

The red-clothed youth said with disdain, “I have already broken your Great Profound Sword Canon, so what other trump cards do you have?”

“Who told you that I only know about the Great Profound Sword Canon?” Ye Guhan stood up as multiple wheels flew out from his body, and his already collapsed sword aura began to climb. In the next second, five elemental wheels appeared behind him. But that wasn’t all as the Sun Wheel and Moon Wheel also appeared, and the sword aura Ye Guhan gave off ripped apart the thirty-six layers of heaven.

This immediately left those from the Bai and Zhang Clans dumbfounded. Even the red-clothed youth was shocked because this was Tian Xuanzi’s cultivation technique, the Profound Sky Canon!
