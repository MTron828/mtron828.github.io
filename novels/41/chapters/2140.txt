Chapter 2141: Why Don't You Take A Guess?

On the Azure Dragon Path, the Dao Yang Holy Son. Bai Shuying, Xin Yan, and Ye Feng sat cross-legged on the Dragon’s Head. The Azure Dragon might not be one of the seven divine dragons, but it symbolized one of the four eternal constellations, and its position within the Kunlun Realm wasn’t at all inferior to the divine dragons.

The competition on the Azure Dragon Path was intense, but it was surprisingly calm on the Dragon’s Head. Not only those from the Heavenly Dao Sect, but the other golden-generation geniuses from the Eastern Desolation’s holy lands were gathered on this Dragon’s Head, such as the little princess of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, Ji Zixi. The holy sons of the Ming Cult, Divine Dao Pavilion, Myriad Lightning Sect, and Heavenly Flame Sects were also gathered here.

But surprisingly, there wasn’t any competition despite having so many golden-generation geniuses from various holy lands gathered here. This was because there was already someone seated on the throne on the Dragon’s Head in the Azure Dragon Path, the Champion of the Fifth Heavenly Path, He Xuanjing.

He Xuanjing came in midway the path. The moment he arrived, everyone from the Eastern Desolation chose to put their differences aside for the time being. So despite the fact that it might seem calm now, it was just the calm before the storm, and there was still some time before the competition for the Dragon’s Head came to an end tomorrow at noon.

In reality, the top of the Dragon Mountains were calm, and no one would rashly make a move before the last moment. The competition was intense and bloody under the Dragon’s Head.

The surrounding scenery was beautiful as everyone on the Dragon’s Head began to cultivate. This was because there was a large amount of dragon aura gathered on the Dragon’s Head, and it was beneficial for cultivation.

Lin Yun’s act of defeating the Lone Mountain’s holy son and holy maiden, along with Mu Qinjue attracted everyone’s attention.

“Why the hell is Ye Qingtian so strong?”

“It’s too much of a pity that the Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t let him go for the Emperor’s Inheritance on the God Burial Mountain Range with his strength.”

“He wasn’t even a Quasi-Saint back then.”

The Eastern Desolation’s golden-generation geniuses were shocked by the strength Ye Qingtian displayed, and this included the Dao Yang Holy Son.

“So Ye Qingtian has become so strong now. He really brought glory to the Heavenly Dao Sect!” The Dao Yang Holy Son smiled. He had a high opinion of Ye Qingtian, so he became excited after he recovered from his shock.

Ye Feng inappropriately interrupted, “I’m afraid he has forgotten his identity as a disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect. Not only did he go to the True Dragon Path, he even went to the Indigo Dragon Path for a demoness and wasn’t even willing to take a look at us.”

Bai Shuying squinted, before she said, “Ye Qingtian isn’t that kind of person.”

“Let us watch and see, then,” Ye Feng smiled.

“Ye Feng, watch your words. There are those from other holy lands here,” Dao Yang Holy Son unhappily transmitted his voice over to Ye Feng.

Ye Feng nodded, but he still looked at Ye Qingtian unhappily.

The atmosphere on the Indigo Dragon Path was tense. Mo Cheng and Luo Ying had lost the ability to continue fighting, but Mu Qianjue could still fight. He ?hovered in mid-air with his wings shining brightly as he looked at Lin Yun. When he descended from the sky, his expression was calm and composed.

“Ever since I came to the Kunlun Realm, you’re the first person to make me feel pressured,” Mu Qianjue said.

Lin Yun was still holding onto the Flower Burial Sword as he replied, “Perhaps because you’re too ignorant. There are many powerful swordsmen in the world.”

Mu Qianjue didn’t seem to take it seriously as he replied, “Perhaps, but it’s a pity that the Flower Burial isn’t here. Otherwise, I would really want to see who has stronger swordsmanship between you and him.”

He spoke the thoughts of many because many people have started to compare Ye Qingtian with Flower Burial based on the strength he showed.

Lin Yun merely smiled and didn’t reply to that statement. His sword aura had locked onto Mu Qianjue, and he was cautious because someone like Mu Qianjue naturally wouldn’t give up so easily. He definitely still had a trump card in his hand.

As a Champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, Lin Yun knew the weight of a fellow champion from the Heavenly Paths, and they naturally wouldn’t be weak since they could emerge victorious. As their auras began to clash on the Dragon’s Head, the surrounding atmosphere became tense. Even the commotion outside the Dragon Mountains had gradually become quiet.

This was because everyone knew that an earth-shattering battle would break out soon, and this naturally made everyone nervous. After all, it would be a big deal if Ye Qingtian could defeat Mu Qianjue, since that meant that the myth of the Heavenly Paths’ champions would be shattered.

Thus, everyone was naturally curious and looking forward to seeing if the myth would hold on or a new legend would be born.

Just when everyone held their breaths while looking at the two, Mu Qianjue was the first to make a move. As the black and white wings behind him released a dazzling radiance, they released illusory wings that expanded to a few hundred feet. As the wings grew, the aura released from Mu Qianjue increased, and the entire world became dyed in black and white.

“Phaseless Star Shattering Slash!” Mu Qianjue hacked down with his two fingers, unleashing a black and white light beam that reached over a thousand feet, looking like a giant sword being swung down from the sky, splitting the sky into two as it descended with a horrifying momentum.

This made everyone take a deep breath because it was as they had expected, Mu Qianjue could still put up a fight.

A silver radiance swept out from Lin Yun, but it only lasted for a brief moment before the silver radiance shattered, showing that it still wasn’t a genuine sword domain. As a result, there was no way the Azure Dragon Sword Heart could bear the intense pressure.

However, Lin Yun didn’t panic because he knew that this attack wasn’t as horrifying as Mu Qianjue’s previous attack, despite looking so powerful. He even suspected that this was a deception released by Mu Qianjue, and his real killing move was waiting for him from behind.

Lin Yun grabbed the Flower Burial Sword with both hands and his dual sword stars began to revolve around him. When he swung his sword, he unleashed a sword ray that shattered the incoming attack. Amidst the loud explosion, Lin Yun took several steps back before he managed to stabilize himself on the ground. In the end, he had underestimated this attack.

But when everything settled down, and Lin Yun was on his guard, Mu Qianjue flapped his wings and flew away, voluntarily giving up his spot on the Indigo Dragon Path.
