Chapter 2358 - You Are?

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he cupped his fists together with a smile, “Senior, you’re too polite.”

After giving three bows, Lin Yun continued, “You don’t have to take what I said to heart.”

He was just joking, and he couldn’t possibly receive an apology from an Emperor. The fact that Profound Sky Venerable could apologize to a junior alone was enough to prove his breadth of mind.

Profound Sky Venerable was briefly stunned. He found Lin Yun more pleasing to the eye now, and he smiled, “It looks like I made a mistake in my judgement.”

“Hahaha! You made Profound Sky apologize to you. Where are you from, and who’s your Senior?”

“You’re not even thirty, right? Impressive!” Four elders appeared beside Profound Sky Venerable as they looked at Lin Yun. They had deep and unfathomable cultivations, and anyone could sense the dao rhythms around them if they got close.

“These are the Heavenly Barren Divine Guards, and no one has made them come down to look at them before,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled. They set up the rules to filter geniuses for the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity.

The Heavenly Barren Realm was divided into nine regions, and they maintained it. This meant that they all grasped Space Dao. Seeing this, Lin Yun honestly replied to their questions.

“Kunlun Realm?” The four divine guards were shocked before their faces became grave while they examined Lin Yun.

“So it’s an old friend from the Kunlun Realm!”

“The Kunlun Realm would send geniuses to participate in the Heavenly Barren Banquet in the past, but none of them managed to reach the end. They can be considered descendants of the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity, but it’s tough on friends from the Kunlun Realm with the Heavenly Path severed.”

“We also participated in that battle back then, but it was a pity that we lost...” They looked at Lin Yun for a long time before cupping their fists together, “Young friend, we’ll wait for you at the Heavenly Barren Banquet.”

After the four left, Profound Sky Venerable looked at Lin Yun, “Lin Yun, I know why you’re here and what you’re bearing. You are more critical than that Heavenly Phoenix Maiden. You want to reforge the Heavenly Path... but it won’t be easy.”

“Senior...”

Lin Yun wanted to say something, but Profound Sky Venerable disrupted him, “You don’t have to say anything. You have to reach the end and reach the Heavenly Barren Banquet, or the ancestral deity won’t be able to help you. The ancestral deity has never forgotten about the agreement with the Blue Dragon King.”

Lin Yun’s face became serious, and he cupped his fists together, “Thank you.”

“Return to Heavenly Barren City. It will take some time before the third stage starts,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

Lin Yun nodded, and everyone in the surroundings was left dumbfounded.

“Ten thousand phenomena? How did he do that?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“This is weird. He found all the phenomena left behind by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity. Furthermore, what’s that golden jade slip?”

“It looks like the true treasure left behind by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity was after comprehending ten thousand phenomena.”

“It seemed to be related to eternity...” The surrounding cultivators gradually came to their senses and even forgot about the bet between Lin Yun and Shangguan Jue. It was so much so that they were more curious about the golden jade slip than the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet. After all, they had determined that it must be a treasure left behind by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity, and everyone knew what that meant.

Right then, Shangguan Jue came over with the Shadow Divine Palace. But Shangguan Jue had dejection on his face, unlike the arrogance he displayed earlier when he obtained eighteen Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets. He could sense that he was only one step away from being an eighth-stage Saint Lord, and he was confident about making it through the tribulation, but everything went down the drain now.

“Here.” Shangguan Jue gave away the twenty Flame Origin Pellets, marking the end of the bet. The pellets were kept in a purple interspatial pouch.

When Lin Yun tried to receive it, Shangguan Jue was reluctant and struggled a little. But Lin Yun laughed as he snatched the pouch, “I've received it!”

The Flame Origin Pellets were refined by the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity, containing primordial aura. Lin Yun could use them after becoming a seventh-stage Saint Lord, which were treasures to him.

The corner of Shangguan Jue’s lips twitched, feeling heartache. He wasn’t the only one because those from the Shadow Divine Palace felt the same. After all, those were twenty Flame Origin Pellets, and they belonged to Lin Yun now.

Zhao Zhanli was unhappy, but there was nothing he could do about it.

Looking at the interspatial pouch, Lin Yun smiled, “Thanks for that.”

But just when he was about to leave, Shangguan Jue stopped him, “Wait up.”

“What’s the matter? You can’t accept your loss?” Xiong Tiannan and the others stepped forth, standing beside Lin Yun.

“Don’t worry. I’m not foolish enough to move before Profound Sky Venerable, not to mention that...” Shangguan Jue awkwardly smiled. But after a long time, he sighed, “I lost to you even though I cheated, so I have no reason to deny my loss.”

Lin Yun pondered, and asked, “You’re talking about that treasure that merged with your eyeball?”

“That’s the Eye of Destiny,” Shangguan Jue said before he calmed down. He then continued, “I only want to know how you defeated me and how you found all the phenomena. I can be sure that there’s no way you can shatter a thousand mirrors, and it has nothing to do with comprehension!”

Shangguan Jue’s words lured everyone’s attention.

Lin Yun smiled, “You’re right. The key lies in the words that Profound Sky Venerable said, so comprehend it yourself.”

After saying that, Lin Yun left with his group without any hesitation. He had a huge harvest, so it was time to increase his strength by making a breakthrough and refine the eighteen Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets and the twenty Flame Origin Pellets. Even the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet could allow his strength to transform, not to mention the golden jade slip. Not only was everyone else curious about it, but even Lin Yun was curious about the jade slip.

“ Profound Sky Venerable’s words? What did he say?” Shangguan Jue was baffled.

Profound Sky Venerable was also baffled, and muttered, “What did I say?”

When Lin Yun’s group reached the foot of the mountain, Xiong Tiannan and everyone asked how Lin Yun found all the phenomena.

“It’s simple, and it’s all in Profound Sky Venerable’s words,” Lin Yun smiled.

“He said that no one has surpassed nine hundred in history,” Lin Jiangxian said.

“That’s right,” Lin Yun smiled, and he shared his experience with everyone.

“That seems pretty simple,” Ao Jue muttered. But he soon shook his head because wanting to reach that level wasn’t easy, and he had to face the ancient mirror at the end. It only looked simple from what Lin Yun said.

When they returned to Heavenly Barren City, Lin Yun asked, “Brother Ao, I came to Heavenly Barren City late. Is there a place suitable for undergoing tribulation here?”

“Of course,” Ao Jue smiled. “The Heavenly Barren Realm is filled with treasures, and there have been those who tried to make a breakthrough or undergo their tribulation here. But I suggest you go to the lesser secret realm.”

After all, the consequences would become dire if Lin Yun’s breakthrough was interrupted. Lin Yun had a lot of treasures on him, and there were bound to be people after him.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up after hearing what Ao Jue said.

“I’ll bring you over,” Ao Jue smiled. “You only need to pay a small price to use it, and I guarantee it will be safe.”

A few minutes later, Lin Yun came to the place Ao Jue said would be safe, the Hundred Aqua Cave. It looked simple on the outside, but it was different inside. Experts from Heaven’s Gate guarded the cave, and everyone could enter if they handed over a pellet. Everyone would have a secret realm of their own to go into seclusion.

After entering the secret realm, Lin Yun took out the golden jade slip and placed it against his forehead. He found himself in a place with a floating painting before him the next second, and the painting was filled with profundity, with Yin and Yang forming a balance. Just looking at it made Lin Yun feel as though he was about to be sucked into it.

“It looks similar to Yin-Yang... Can this be Yin-Yang Dao?” Lin Yun muttered.

“This is the Flaming Yin-Yang Painting. I comprehended a profundity in the past, and this is where the ten thousand phenomena came from, and comprehending this painting means comprehending Yin-Yang Dao.” A voice resounded in Lin Yun’s ears.

When Lin Yun turned around, he saw a white-clothed youth. He was briefly stunned, before he asked, “You’re... How do I address you?”

“I have many names, but you can call me Xiao Chen. The White-Clothed Bladesman Xiao Chen. I prefer this name,” the white-clothed youth smiled.
