Chapter 2041 - Placed In A Difficult Position

Lin Yun came to a galaxy as his soul passed through the thirty-six layers of heaven. There was an unimaginable distance between the stars, so the light given off by the stars wasn’t that obvious.

As Lin Yun wandered into the galaxy, it didn’t take long for him to feel dizzy, and his sword intent showed signs of collapsing. The galaxy was terrifying. Lin Yun’s soul was about to dissipate after wandering here for so long.

This shocked Lin Yun as he recalled what Ye Guhan said and quickly circulated the Myriad Astral Celestial Art. His sword intent began to condense as he sat in the galaxy, luring the flames of the stars into him. Fortunately, his senior brother taught him the Myriad Astral Celestial Art. Otherwise, his sword intent would have dissipated by now.

With his Astral Sword Intent reaching greater mastery, he could transform his star into a galaxy. This was the genuine Astral Sword Intent, and his previous Astral Sword Intent could be considered baseless because his previous Astral Sword Intent couldn’t bear the impact of a galaxy.

The so-called “star” was the sword star, and the galaxy would manifest into various phenomena along with the sword star. The more powerful the galaxy, the more powerful the sword star would become. It was just like the dao flame left behind by the Emperor Sword.

If Lin Yun wanted to manifest the sword star, he would have to merge the star with his sword soul before choosing a star to observe and manifest. Relying on the Nine-Colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit’s medicinal effects in addition to Lin Yun’s accumulation, the starlight around Lin Yun increased as time passed. Lin Yun didn’t take long to be enveloped in starlight as he circulated the Myriad Astral Celestial Art.

Beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven, starlight began to converge as the starlight began to condense. Lin Yun wanted to manifest his star into a sun like his senior brother, Jian Jingtian.

Most swordsmen would choose between the sun or the moon because those two were the strongest. Although there were other stars comparable to the sun and moon, it was hard to find them within the boundless galaxy, while the sun and moon were the brightest.

As time passed, the golden human within Lin Yun’s sword sea began to fuse, and the sun gradually formed. When Lin Yun heaved a breath of relief and wanted to open his eyes, the azure dragon within his sword sea also flew out.

This shocked Lin Yun, and he wondered if his other sword soul could also manifest into a sword star. His senior brother didn’t tell him about this situation before, so this caught Lin Yun by surprise.

Most people would only have one sword soul and could only manifest a single sword star. Even the Myriad Astral Celestial Art didn’t mention two sword stars. Since Ye Guhan didn’t know Lin Yun’s condition, he naturally didn’t tell Lin Yun how to deal with it.

Lin Yun watched as his azure dragon sword soul flew to the thirty-six layers of heaven, and Lin Yun had to make a decision now. He decided to manifest another star without hesitation. Two sword stars meant the power of his Astral Sword Intent would also increase, but the process would naturally be dangerous since the resources required would also increase.

This vexed Lin Yun because he had no intentions of manifesting two sword stars. This would ruin his plan. But before he had no choice and could only manifest another sword star.

Lin Yun circulated the Myriad Astral Celestial Art to manifest another sword star. By the time he opened his eyes, it was already dusk.

“You succeeded?” Crane Fairy came over and nervously asked.

Li Daoyang also came over with anticipation. He had heard that the process was dangerous, and that the effort would go in vain if Ye Qingtian wasn’t careful.

There were no changes to Lin Yun’s face, and he said nothing.

“You failed?” Crane Fairy became nervous and comforted, “No worries. It’s normal to fail. You have a strong foundation, and you can attempt it again.”

Li Daoyang also nodded, “You have yet to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm, so it’s understandable for you to fail without the support of saint aura. I believe you can succeed when you reach the Quasi-Saint Realm in the future.”

“I didn’t fail,” Lin Yun sent a weird look at Li Daoyang and Crane Fairy. Since when did he say he failed?

““What’s with your bitter expression, then?”” The Crane Fairy and Li Daoyang asked curiously.

Lin Yun stood up and helplessly replied, “I have no idea why, but I’ve managed to manifest two sword stars. I was thinking about what I should do in the future. One sword star would require an astronomical sum of resources…not to mention two sword stars…”

The Crane Fairy and Li Daoyang opened their mouths and didn’t know how to reply. They were speechless when they heard Ye Qingtian say that he had manifested two sword stars.

Li Daoyang wanted to curse out, but he swallowed his words and squeezed out a smile.

But the Crane Fairy couldn’t bear it and exclaimed, “Holy shit!”

Li Daoyang knocked on her head and smiled, “A little girl like you shouldn’t say such crude words.”

“Isn’t that what you wanted to say?” The Crane Fairy asked.

“But I bore it in,” Li Daoyang said.

The Crane Fairy rolled her eyes and ignored Li Daoyang.

Li Daoyang looked at Lin Yun, then he continued with a smile, “Ye Qingtian, do you have two sword souls?”

Lin Yun nodded upon hearing that.

“No wonder,” Li Daoyang smiled. “Dual sword souls are rare. Now that you have two sword stars, your sword intent will multiply by two when you release it. If you can manifest some changes with it, I can’t imagine how powerful you will become.”

Crane Fairy chipped in, “I heard that the Iris Sword Saint also had dual sword stars back then, and this was why he could slay a deity while being at the Saint Realm.”

“Children shouldn’t interfere in a conversation between adults. Brother Ye, I have something to discuss with you.” Li Daoyang pushed Crane Fairy away and dragged Lin Yun over with a warm-hearted expression. “Brother Ye, do you intend to become a holy son?”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Lin Yun was surprised when he heard that and looked at Li Daoyang, baffled.

“Don’t you have two sword stars? If you become a holy son, you’ll have all the necessary resources,” Li Daoyang said.

Lin Yun gave Li Daoyang a weird look and said, “Doesn’t the Heavenly Dao Sect already have a holy son? I heard that the Holy Spirit Son of the Holy Spirit Courtyard has a position equivalent to a holy son.”

A holy son’s position couldn’t be decided randomly. When a holy son appears in a holy land, they would be nurtured as a future Saint Lord with the entire sect’s resources going to them. Although the Heavenly Dao Sect’s situation was special, that was also almost the case. Otherwise, Li Daoyang wouldn’t be called one of Eastern Desolation’s Twin Stars.

“He’s still lacking,” Li Daoyang smiled. “Why can’t you become a holy son after forming two sword stars? We have two holy maidens, and there’s no harm in having another holy child. We should have a Heavenly Dao Holy Son, a title even more domineering than mine.”

Lin Yun was confused as to why Li Daoyang was so passionate about this. It was right that the Heavenly Dao Sect had two holy maidens, but their position couldn’t be compared to Li Daoyang.

“There’s no need.” Lin Yun shook his head and said, “If I become a holy son, the four clans will probably go crazy.”

“Aren’t they already crazy? Although they don’t have evidence of Ye Qinghong, Xiao Jingyan, and Zhang Kui’s disappearance within the Myriad Graves Valley, they already counted that incident on your head, and they will come after you sooner or later,” Li Daoyang smiled.

Lin Yun was stunned and couldn’t help looking at Li Daoyang again. He discovered that Li Daoyang might seem like he didn’t care about anything, but he had a meticulous heart. He instantly knew Li Daoyang’s arrival to the Celestial Purging Mountain wasn’t as simple as seeing him.
