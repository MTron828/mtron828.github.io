Chapter 573 - Flower Burial Sword in Hand, Never Surrender!

The sky turned dark when Cao Zhen brought out his true cultivation. He didn’t give Lin Yun the slightest chance as he soared into the sky and unleashed his aura. He was finally going to use his strongest attack.

“In the name of my sword, bloom!” The outline of a massive Iris Sword Flower bloomed behind as Lin Yun and his sword aura began to rise. He immediately stabbed his sword at Cao Zhen.

The saber ray descended from the sky and collided with the Flower Burial Sword. The ferocious collision made the entire stage tremble as explosions began to sound out. This was followed by the stage ripping apart and forming terrifying ravines. As a gigantic cloud of dust rose into the sky, the spiritual array on the stage lit up with a dazzling radiance. However, the array was having great difficulty containing Lin Yun and Cao Zhen’s attacks. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Everyone who saw this scene sucked in a deep breath. They could guess that Cao Zhen was in the greater Yang stage, but they didn’t know exactly how terrifying he was. His saber had turned the entire stage into a mess.

However, the crowd was even more shocked that Lin Yun was able to withstand Cao Zhen’s attack. Although he looked a little pathetic, he didn’t suffer any major injuries from the collision. If someone else was in his position, their body would have been mutilated by the terrifying saber.

Then, the crowd searched for Lin Yun inside the cloud of dust. When the dust eventually settled down, Lin Yun’s figure was revealed. He was covered in wounds that dyed his azure clothes red. When the spectators saw this scene, many of them shook their heads inwardly.

“Holy shit… Lin Yun barely managed to withstand Cao Zhen’s attack.”

“Cao Zhen is, after all, the monstrous genius nurtured by the Northern Snow Manor.”

“There isn’t any suspense in this fight anymore.”

Everyone from the Heavenly Province Academy had concern in their eyes as the difference in Lin Yun and Cao Zhen’s cultivation was too great. It didn’t even matter that Lin Yun brought out Dazzling Moment. Although Lin Yun’s origin energy could easily suppress the likes of Luo Shen, Chen Yu, Bai Yuchen, and Cao Xiu, there was still a huge gap between him and Cao Zhen.

The ancient Iris Sword Sutra was powerful, but there was nothing Lin Yun could do if he was too far behind in his cultivation.

“The Heavenly Province Academy is too naive to think that they can challenge Cao Zhen with this strength.”

“They’re not at the same level at all.” The Violethut Academy’s party all had joy on their faces. Only the elderly man who led the party wore a grave expression as he said, “Don’t rejoice too early. Cao Zhen might have gotten the upperhand in the previous collision, but Lin Yun didn’t suffer too much of a loss. His injuries are superficial, so he can still put up a fight.”

The elder was experienced, so he knew that nothing was certain in a battle. But even so, he felt more assurance in Cao Zhen. Even if Lin Yun had his opportunities, he still couldn’t get any upper hand against Cao Zhen.

“Your sword sutra is impressive,” said Cao Zhen. After all, even disciples in the same cultivation as him wouldn’t dare to take his attack head-on. Not only did Lin Yun take his attack head-on, but he only suffered some light injuries.

“What terrifying cultivation…” Lin Yun looked at his injuries as he wore a serious expression. This was the first time he suffered such a great loss after reaching the Violet Palace Realm. He knew that the difference between them was great. Even Cao Xiu, Bai Yuchen, Luo Shen, and Chen Yu couldn’t take an attack from Cao Zhen.

“You’ve given me a surprise, but this is just the beginning!” Cao Zhen snorted as he disappeared once more and clashed with Lin Yun once again.

Lin Yun wore a grave expression as he faced Cao Zhen head-on while circulating the Iris Sword Sutra frantically. But in just ten moves, Lin Yun was starting to feel burdened as he could sense the stability of Cao Zhen’s cultivation. He could also tell that Cao Zhen’s origin was carefully refined.

If Lin Yun hadn’t consumed the Yin-Yang Jadecloud Pellet, he would only be able to fight with Cao Zhen by relying on secret techniques. If that happened, he would lose in just three moves. Even now, he could barely contend with Cao Zhen by reverse circulation of the Iris Flower in his violet palace. There was no way he could maintain this state for long, so he would be the one to have his origin energy consumed first.

“Are you wavering now? You should surrender if you’re starting to feel fear. Otherwise, I won’t go easy on you,” barked Cao Zhen as he sensed the fluctuation in Lin Yun’s heart before he charged with his boundless saber aura.

As Lin Yun continued to clash with Cao Zhen, cracks began to appear on the Iris Flower above his head. Many of the spectating experts noticed it.

“Cao Zhen is really terrifying. Lin Yun can’t grab the upper hand even with his xiantian sword intent.”

“Once that Iris Flower shatters, it won’t take long for Lin Yun to be defeated.”

“The Absolutecloud Saber is a profound technique. Can it be that this saber technique counters Lin Yun?” Many people could see that Lin Yun wasn’t in an optimistic position as the fight continued.

However, only Cao Zhen knew that he was feeling vexed with Lin Yun. Lin Yun had pushed the Iris Sword Sutra to the limit, and despite having the upper hand, Cao Zhen couldn’t afford to make any mistakes. He knew that Lin Yun would instantly turn the tables around if he did. If that happened, Cao Zhen wouldn’t be able to escape with only light injuries.

“What an annoyance!” Cao Zhen’s pupils flashed with rage as his saber ray manifested into a roaring python that unleashed an ice breath from its mouth. The python was massive and its size occupied half the stage.

“Shit!” The faces of the Heavenly Province Academy’s party changed as this attack caught them by surprise. Even from a few thousand meters away, they could sense how terrifying this attack was. They couldn’t imagine the pressure that Lin Yun was feeling right now.

“Luminous Moon!” Lin Yun narrowed his eyes into slits as he swung out his sword. A radiant moon flew out as it separated into nine silver rays. When the silver sword rays clashed with the python, a series of violent explosions rang out in the mountain.

The explosions created craters on the ground and the shockwave from the collision was visible to the spectators. Many spectators had to squint their eyes from the wind and fear was even reflected in the depths of their pupils.

This collision was simply too powerful. It didn’t seem like something two youths under the age of twenty could unleash.

As the last explosion rang out, two figures flew out from the cloud of dust, which attracted everyone’s attention.

“I never imagined that you would be so powerful despite your cultivation. But no one can stop me from getting what belongs to the Violethut Academy!” Cao Zhen’s eyes flashed coldly.

“You’ll have to ask my sword for permission,” smiled Lin Yun with his brow raised. He was covered in blood, but his pupils boiled with fighting spirit while his sword buzzed in disagreement. With the Flower Burial Sword in his hand, he would never surrender!
