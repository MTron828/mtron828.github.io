Chapter 1964 - Yours Are Even Smaller Than Zhang Yue’s

Lin Yun’s words left everyone dumbfounded, before their cheeks started to tremble under the uncontrollable fury as they looked at Ye Qingtian’s face. Ye Qingtian didn’t have the slightest spirit as a swordsman, and they would be pissed to death if they were in Ye Xin’s position.

It was simply too humiliating to be treated as a clown. Ye Xin thought he was smart, but it turned out that he was the clown right from the start. Everyone was furious, not to mention the Ye Clan’s members, whose faces were terrifyingly dark.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Ye Qingtian, you’re too much!” Ye Xin’s face turned red, and he confidently said, “You must’ve learned it somewhere. That’s right, the Azure River Sword Saint must’ve taught it to you!”

Everyone’s eyes lit up because there was that possibility. After all, everyone saw how Ye Guhan took Ye Qingtian away seven days ago, and Ye Qingtian reached the Nirvana Stage when he returned. So it would make sense if they followed Ye Xin’s trail of thoughts. Ye Guhan must’ve taught Ye Qingtian the sword technique and helped him refine the saint origin for him to have such an impressive achievement today.

“Slap yourself,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“I…” Ye Xin slapped himself before he could even respond. He still wanted to struggle, but his right hand gave him another slap that burned his cheek.

The surroundings immediately became silent, and even Ye Qinghong lowered his head. This was the first time the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint taught a junior lesson.

“Ye Qingtian, I’m impressed by your performance. I have deliberately left a word out on purpose,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint praised, and she continued, “I’ll end the lecture today. I’ll continue this two days from now, and don’t forget to recall what I said today. Remember the sword technique you guys learned today.”

After the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint finished, she was enveloped in a saint radiance and rose to the sky.

Seeing this scene, everyone bowed and cupped their hands together, “We respectfully send off Martial Aunt!”

On the other hand, Lin Yun was a little disappointed and wondered if she left because of him. When the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint left, the pressure that was on everyone was alleviated, and they began to discuss with each other.

They all felt that they had a great harvest today from the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s lecture. Not only did their comprehension of sword dao improve, but their sword intent also made substantial progress. They were also enlightened by the swordsmanship.

Lin Yun turned to look at Bai Shuying. He never expected that she would try and make things difficult for him several times today, and he smiled, “What does the holy maiden think of my performance today?”

Bai Shuying was inwardly furious, but she had an aloof personality. Even if she didn’t like someone, she would honestly admit the merits of someone. She said, “I have witnessed Young Master Ye’s extraordinary talent in sword dao today.”

Lin Yun was surprised because he never expected that Bai Shuying would admit it. He smiled, “Holy Maiden’s zither skills are impressive as well, but it sounds a little lacking.”

“So?” Bai Shuying raised her brow.

Lin Yun smiled, “Let’s find a time, and you can play a song for me. Let me experience it once more.”

The faces of Xiao Jingyan and the others changed, while being unable to help looking at Ye Qingtian. After all, Ye Qingtian was too arrogant to ask the holy maiden to play the zither for him.

“Ye Qingtian, don’t be complacent. You only received some guidance from the Azure River Saint Sword, so what are you so arrogant about?!” Bai Yizhou roared furiously.

“Holy Maiden, there’s no need to pay any attention to him. That brat needs to be taught a lesson!” Ye Xin said.

“Silence! Are the two slaps not enough for you?” Bai Shuying loathed Ye Xin more than Ye Qingtian. This instantly stunned everyone because it was rare for Bai Shuying to scold someone so badly.

This immediately placed Ye Xin in an awkward position, wanting to dig a hole and hide his head. But he blamed it all on Ye Qingtian, furiously looking at the latter with an eerie gaze.

“Sure.” Bai Shuying coldly looked at Ye Qingtian before she left, flinging her sleeve. She was inwardly furious because she couldn’t help getting angry for some reason whenever she met Ye Qingtian. Ye Qingtian would always gain the upper hand against her, naturally making her uncomfortable.

“I’ll be waiting, then,” Lin Yun smiled.

“That brat is really impressive…” Chen Zhong smiled with his eyes squinted. He realized that he had underestimated Ye Qingtian.

“Ye Qingtian, how dare you publically deceive and fool us!” Ye Xin said after Bai Shuying left. His face was terrifyingly dark as he gritted his teeth.

Beside Ye Qinghong, Ye Yanbei’s face changed. He wanted to stop Ye Xin because they were in the Solar Jade Palace, but Ye Qinghong stopped him with a gaze.

“It’s not ‘us’, you’re the only one who was fooled,” Lin Yun smiled.

“You bastard! Not only did you launch a sneak attack on me, but you even dared to frame me?! I won’t let you go so easily today!” Ye Xin’s rage blazed within his chest, and he couldn’t bear it any longer.

On the contrary, Lin Yun merely smiled because he didn’t fear Ye Xin. Did Ye Xin really think he could do anything to him because his cultivation was at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage? Lin Yun was someone who almost killed a Quasi-Saint monarch demonic beast. If he didn’t have to hold back, no one here could keep him around, even if they all came at him.

Lin Yun tugged his arms before his chest and smiled, “I like giving others a chance the most. Ye Feifan wanted me to go to the Di Group, and I gave him a chance, too. But it’s a pity that he’s too useless. I’ll also give you a chance today. Come on, let me see how you’ll teach me a lesson.”

His provocation instantly placed Ye Xin in a difficult spot with no retreat.

“That fellow is really insane. It’s no wonder why he even dared to slap a Saint Lord.”

“But the situation doesn’t seem to be on Ye Qingtian’s side. Ye Xin is at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and there’s a huge difference between the fourth and fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage!”

“Ye Qingtian has just entered the Nirvana Stage. Otherwise, where does he get his confidence from if he hadn’t even congealed the nirvana aura.”

Everyone here was a swordsman, and they had already expected a battle between Ye Xin and Ye Qingtian. But they never expected that it would take place in the palace.

Ye Xin sneered, “Son of a bitch, let me show you the true power of the Ye Clan’s direct lineage today!”

Lin Yun couldn’t help laughing when he heard what Ye Xin said, and he couldn’t notice anything impressive about Ye Xin.

Ye Xin quickly drew his sword and unleashed his attack against Ye Qingtian, swinging his sword while accompanying it with a majestic aura. Faint cracks could be seen in the surrounding space as the saint sword arrived above Lin Yun’s head.

Ye Xin was fast, but Lin Yun was even faster after practicing the Divine Sunchasing Art. He easily avoided Ye Xin’s attack with a flash without even leaving behind an afterimage. When he reappeared, he wore a playful smile while holding onto a long strap in his hand.

When Ye Xin lowered his head, his face changed because his pants were coming loose.

“My belt…” Ye Xin raised his head and looked at the belt in Lin Yun’s hand.

“You’re not worthy of having me draw my sword. I’ll use this belt to have some fun with you!” Lin Yun smiled and used the belt as a sword to execute the Divine Firefly Sword. Lin Yun performed the Divine Firefly Sword as they clashed and attacked Ye Xin.

As continuous clashes echoed, it didn’t take long for Ye Xin to be placed in a disadvantageous position. Ye Xin had a high cultivation, and he also had a decent sword technique. But he was no different from a child before Lin Yun and couldn’t even unleash his ordinary state.

He could only receive a one-sided beating from Lin Yun, and his Divine Firefly Sword wasn’t as exquisite as Lin Yun's. After Lin Yun performed the fifth sword form, Ye Xin was already barely holding on, and the sword in his hand was knocked away by the belt in Lin Yun’s hand.

When the saint sword plunged into the stone pillar, Ye Xin was stumped. But before he could respond, the belt in Lin Yun’s hand was like a palm slapping his face.

No one expected Ye Qingtian to be so ruthless, especially when Ye Qingtian slapped the face of Ye Clan’s direct lineage. This naturally made the faces of the Ye Clan’s members terrifyingly dark.

With a resounding slap, Ye Xiu was sent flying away while Lin Yun merely smiled, and the belt in his hand turned into a dragon that was dashing over.

“Arghhh!” Ye Xin was frightened by this scene as he backed up, knocking against a stone pillar.

When the dragon dissipated, the belt was deeply plunged into the stone pillar like a sharp sword. At the same time, Ye Xiu’s pants finally couldn’t hold on and slipped down.

When all the spectators saw this scene, they couldn’t help taking a deep breath. But that wasn’t all. Lin Yun briefly glanced at Ye Xiu’s tool before he said with a playful smile, “Ye Xin, yours are even smaller than Zhang Yue’s!”

Everyone’s lips twitched because Ye Qingtian was too ruthless, and his words were extremely insulting. The entire Heavenly Dao Sect knew how small Zhang Yue was, and even the female disciples of the Profound Maiden Courtyard laughed at him.

So Ye Xin naturally felt ashamed to be compared to Zhang Yue. He knew he was finished, and the entire Heavenly Dao Sect would know he was smaller than Zhang Yue. Most importantly, the news of his tool being smaller than Zhang Yue’s would spread like wildfire within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and this naturally made the faces of everyone from the Ye Clan ugly.

“This is the foundation of the Ye Clan’s direct lineage? Doesn’t seem so impressive after all. Is this the best of the Ye Clan?” Lin Yun glanced at Ye Qinghong’s group. His words included Ye Qinghong and everyone else from the Ye Clan.

“Ye Qingtian, do you think there’s no one capable of subduing you in the Ye Clan?” Ye Yanbei couldn’t hold back any longer and charged at Lin Yun. He had a fiery temper but was also calm under his rage. When he approached Lin Yun, he didn’t allow him to draw his sword and unleashed his cultivation at the sixth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

When his massive nirvana aura enveloped Lin Yun, he raised his hand and punched Lin Yun’s face. He wanted to rely on his cultivation to inflict severe injuries on Ye Qingtian in one move.
