Chapter 2367 - Lin Yun’s Sword

The moment Lin Yun spoke, he released his murderous intent, instantly capturing the attention of the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. Seeing that Lin Yun had no fear for him, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit became enraged.

“How dare you provoke me!” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit roared and charged at Lin Yun with his arms spread apart, creating a powerful current that enveloped Lin Yun, greatly hindering his movement technique with a powerful suction force to try and pull him over. The current even left fine cracks in the air, suppressing sword intent.

“Azure Dragon Sword Domain!” Lin Yun released his sword domain, with a silver sword radiance sweeping out, filling each corner within a hundred meters in radius. Once it’s released, it instantly crushed the two spatial vortexes, and the restriction on his movement technique was lifted. Relying on his Sword Domain, he soared to the sky and faced the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

“Azure Dragon’s Grasp!” As a thunderstorm revolved in his palm, Lin Yun poured his sword intent into his palm and clashed with the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. This produced a loud explosion with a terrifying shockwave sweeping out, forcing Lin Yun to take a few steps back.

The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit only slightly tilted its body and didn’t take a step back. A brief moment later, the two clashed again, exchanging over ten-odd moves in a split second.

Lin Yun used his fingers as a sword, clashing with the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, but his attacks only left sparks and couldn’t injure the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit since he also had demonic runes on his body. The demonic runes were silver and were even more powerful.

When their palms clashed, they took ten-odd steps, and even the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was shocked.

“It looks like I have underestimated this fellow,” Lin Yun muttered. But fortunately, this Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was only a seventh-stage Saint Lord. If it was an eighth-stage Saint Lord, the other party could injure him if he didn’t draw his sword.

The eyes of the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit flashed as he stared at Lin Yun and fell into deep thoughts. It had just awakened and hadn’t completely recovered its intelligence. But he wanted to end the battle quickly.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. Two sword spirits began to shine brightly, with sword rays gushing from his body, forming into a dragon and a phoenix. Simultaneously, as a sword vibration echoed from Lin Yun’s body, the Flower Burial Sword flew out, which Lin Yun grabbed.

In the next second, Lin Yun’s aura changed, and the eyes of the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit squinted, sensing a hint of danger coming from Lin Yun.

“A small fly like you dares to create chaos here?!” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit coldly questioned.

“Your burial ground,” Lin Yun said as he executed the Divine Firefly Sword. When eighteen flowers flew out, the Flower Burial Sword released powerful sword rays against the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, leaving behind faint wounds, but still couldn’t break through those demonic runes.

“Pitiful tricks!” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit waved his hand and allowed the sword rays to sweep over him. He merely sneered as he looked at the incoming attacks. When Lin Yun’s afterimages overlapped, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s eyes coldly flashed before he clamped onto the Flower Burial Sword.

When a vibrating noise came from the sword, Lin Yun was surprised to see a palm directed at him. He raised his hand and clashed head-on, but the boundless saint energy pouring over instantly destroyed the thirty-six afterimages.

The flowers also began to crumble into petals. But the power of the palm continued moving forward, destroying the trees behind Lin Yun and even breaking a small part of a mountain.

Ji Zixi and others facing the demonic corpses quickly ducked when they sensed danger approaching. The palm flew past them and continued to head into the distance under their shocked gazes.

They were surprised when they saw the crumbling flowers since this was the first time they saw someone resolving Lin Yun’s sword technique. At the same time, beams of light shot into the sky within the woods as people began to crush their medals when they ran into danger and wanted to escape. Some couldn’t even do that in time and let out a scream.

“What’s going on?” Xiong Tiannan was baffled.

“They might have run into Silver-Eyed Demonspirits as well,” Ao Jue said. He looked at Ji Zixi and Lin Jiangxian, saying, “Xiong Tiannan and I will deal with these demonic corpses. You two go take a look at Lin Yun.”

“Okay.” The two women nodded, knowing that the situation didn’t look good for them.

“Your attainment in saint dao seems ordinary,” the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit said as he held onto the Flower Burial Sword with his fingers and wore a playful gaze.

Lin Yun tried to draw his sword back but frowned when he couldn’t budge the sword.

“You’re too young. If you’re a few hundred years older, just using the Divine Light Sword Intent would be enough to suppress me, not to mention your Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent.” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit smiled before he roared, “This is not how you use the sword. Let me teach you!”

Lin Yun felt a powerful saint energy gushing over through the sword.

Seeing this, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit smiled, “This sword has the foundation of a Sovereign Saint Sword. Not bad... Stop struggling. This belongs to me now.”

The moment he finished speaking, he released a powerful demonic radiance, with the demonic runes on him becoming even more dazzling. He was practically fusing all of his saint dao within his body, bringing tremendous pressure to Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun had no change on his face, and indifferently said, “It’s not that easy to take my sword away.”

“Young man, do you think that you can threaten me?” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit mocked, then continued, “As a swordsman, your sword has been restrained by me. You should be ashamed of yourself, so let me show you respect. There’s no way you can be compared to a Demonspirit Marquis!”

The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit increased his strength, wanting to pull the Flower Burial Sword away.

Lin Yun had expected this and used his fingers as a sword to stab at the demonic runes on the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s chest. When they were in a stalemate earlier, he noticed that the demonic runes had formed into an array. The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s physique wasn’t invincible, it was relying on an array. Since it was an array, there must be a weakness, and the weakness kept changing, which made it hard to find.

“Now!” Taking advantage of the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s attention on the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun used his fingers as a sword and stabbed the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s demonic runes. This made the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit throw out a mouthful of blood and the Flower Burial Sword broke free from his hand. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Damn it!” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was enraged as he opened the vertical eye on his forehead, increasing his aura. The demonic aura he gave off soared to the sky, causing Lin Jiangxian and Ji Zixi’s faces to change before quickly blocking the aura.

“It looks like I’m right!” Lin Yun smiled as he grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword again.

When the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit threw a palm over, the surrounding space shattered with heaven and earth trembling. If this palm landed on Lin Yun, he would be heavily injured, even if he wasn’t dead. But the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s attack missed its mark. Lin Yun had divided himself into two, each one wielding the Flower Burial Sword.

It was the clone technique of the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. The two swords unleashed a powerful sword ray, with the two sword spirits empowering his attack with flames blazing wildly. When the two swords intertwined, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s head flew off.

“I already said that it’s not easy to take my sword,” Lin Yun said as he executed the Divine Firefly Sword again. As two flowers bloomed, thirty-six afterimages flew out, each performing a sword technique. When the sword rays intertwined, flower petals danced and the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was chopped into thousands of pieces.

When all the afterimages combined, Lin Yun waved his hand and grabbed onto a silver spirit core. Everything happened in the blink of an eye without any hindrance. So what if I’m young? Did the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit think that just anyone could grasp the Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent at such a young age?

Lin Yun held onto the silver spirit core when Ji Zixi and Lin Jiangxian saw this scene upon flying over. They were shocked that Lin Yun had turned the tables around in the blink of an eye. Most importantly, where did the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit go?

“Where’s the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit?” Ji Zixi asked with disbelief as she looked around.

“Over here.” Lin Yun smiled as he raised the silver spirit core in his hand.

“H-How is that possible?” Lin Jiangxian was surprised. Earlier, she was shocked by Lin Yun’s cultivation, but now she was shocked again by Lin Yun’s sword.

“Where’s the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit?” Ao Jue and Xiong Tiannan rushed over and widened their mouths with disbelief when they saw the silver spirit core in Lin Yun’s hand.

“Let’s put that aside for now,” Lin Yun said as he handed the silver spirit core to Ji Zixi. He said, “Something must’ve happened in the woods.”
