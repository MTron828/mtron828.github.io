Chapter 2186 - Divine Clouds Dissipating

When the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint’s headless corpse flew away, blood spewed from the neck and soon dyed the ground with blood,

“What kind of monster is he?”

“He killed a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase who reached the Saint Soul Stage?” All the Saints present were shocked. It was as though they had just witnessed a fairytale. They noticed that the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint had cowered at the final moment, and so he lost his life because of it. Otherwise, it would have been death on both sides, instead.

In reality, Lin Yun wasn’t as terrifying as he looked, but this was Ye Qingtian’s victory, no matter who looked at it. Furthermore, Ye Qingtian seemed to have predicted that the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint would cower at the end, which was what shocked everyone.

Judging from the confidence in Ye Qingtian’s eyes, it gave everyone the feeling that he would swing his sword without any hesitation, even if it was a Saint standing in front of him, and this was what made everyone feel a chill run down their spines.

As everyone’s gazes fell onto Lin Yun, they watched as he wiped the blood off his lips, which made their scalps go numb.

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign’s body was trembling as he pointed at Lin Yun, and roared, “Ye Qingtian, aren’t you too ruthless?! Even if the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint went a little too far, you shouldn’t have killed him! You’re a saint disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect, and yet you killed a fellow disciple!”

But Lin Yun wore a mocking expression, looking relaxed as he wiped his sword and sheathed it into the scabbard before looking at the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign. Ignoring the latter’s rage and tone containing murderous intent, he smiled with contempt in his eyes, “You already said that I’m Flower Burial. Since I’m the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, I should be fearless and kill him since he wanted me dead.”

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign emotionally said, “You’ve admitted that you’re Flower Burial! You’re Lin Yun!”

“Whatever you say. Flower Burial isn’t an embarrassing identity, not to mention being the direct disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Since you have admitted your identity, don’t blame me for being shameless, then!” Looking at the indifference on Lin Yun’s face, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign gritted his teeth. After all, he was being looked down upon by a brat, and he looked as though he would make a move the next moment to kill Lin Yun. He gave off a terrifying pressure, which became moreso since it was all directed at a Quasi-Saint.

But Lin Yun was fearless as he took a step forth, bearing the pressure. He smiled, “Old goat, what are you trying to do? If you really think that I am Flower Burial, don’t forget that my senior brother, the Azure River Sword Saint, is here.”

Ye Guhan was chewing on the Divine Dragon Fruit, and he bitterly smiled when his name was called out. He could tell that Lin Yun was starting to lose his patience.

But that wasn’t all. Lin Yun took another step forth, and smiled, “If you think that I am Flower Burial, my two mistresses, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint are here, not to mention my other master, the Dragon Origin Great Saint.”

As Lin Yun spoke, he managed to suppress the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign’s aura. But that wasn’t all as he dropped his smile, and roared, “Any single one of them can easily kill you with a step. Who the hell do you think you are? What qualifications do you have to stand before me, aside from being old?”

Following his questions, Lin Yun managed to suppress the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign’s aura as a Quasi-Saint, making the latter stutter.

“Ye Qingtian, you can go back now.” The Thousand Plume Great Saint sighed. He no longer persisted with getting Lin Yun to try to bring the Emperor Sword back. He knew that the Gale Rein Great Saint wouldn’t let Lin Yun try, and forcibly making Lin Yun try was being unfair to the young man.

“Come here. Don’t be so rude.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint reprimanded. He then reached out, dragging Lin Yun over to him. He pulled Lin Yun behind him, which was a form of protection.

“Tough Peak Saint Sovereign, you sit down as well. It is natural to not be able to hold back in a battle between Quasi-Saints, so you don’t have to be so harsh. Not to mention that Ye Qingtian is the Heavenly Dragon Lord.” The Gale Rein Great Saint gave the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign a step down.

As the surrounding atmosphere eased up, no one further dwelled if Ye Qingtian was Flower Burial. To the Gale Rein Great Saint, the death of a Ye Clan’s Quasi-Saint was nothing compared to letting Ye Qingtian try to bring the Emperor Sword back. But if the Thousand Plume Great Saint wanted to let Ye Qingtian try, the Gale Rein Great Saint couldn’t afford to take the bet, so he didn’t dare.

A discussion broke out from the guests, and even a fool could tell that something wasn’t right with the atmosphere here. The undercurrent within the Heavenly Dao Sect seemed to be surfacing.

“Senior Brother, is he Flower Burial?” Most people were still shocked by how Lin Yun intimidated a Saint Sovereign, but there was one person who looked at Ye Qingtian with a complicated gaze. She had doubts in her eyes and was emotional.

This person was the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden, Bai Shuying. Earlier, when the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign said that Ye Qingtian was Lin Yun, her heart nearly jumped out from her chest, and her gaze was glued on Ye Qingtian. She was feeling uneasy, hoping and not hoping that Ye Qingtian was Lin Yun.

“It should be a lie. Do you think someone with a fake identity would dare to be as arrogant as him?” The Dao Yang Holy Son smiled.

“Behave yourself and don’t move,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said after pulling Lin Yun behind him.

Lin Yun nodded because he could sense that the surrounding atmosphere wasn’t right. But this had nothing to do with him but that mysterious cloaked person.

This was because that cloaked person’s hand fell onto his hood. As more Saints noticed this, their gazes fell onto him. Everyone gradually became nervous, even the Gale Rein Great Saint and Thousand Plume Great Saint had directed their attention over to that cloaked person, and the entire plaza fell into a dead silence.

“The ceremony hasn’t come to an end yet,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint broke the silence as he spoke out.

“Forget about it. This ceremony has become a mess, and the Heavenly Dao Sect doesn’t deserve its reputation as the strongest holy land in the Eastern Desolation. I am already losing my patience.”

When the cloaked person opened his mouth, Lin Yun instantly figured out who he was. The cloaked person was Tian Xuanzi!

Tian Xuanzi suddenly stood up and threw the cloak away, causing the entire plaza to tremble. When he threw the cloak at the sky, the golden clouds began to dissipate like melting snow, and all the phenomenon disappeared. The solemn and dignified atmosphere on the plaza disappeared like a bubble being popped, shocking everyone.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After Tian Xuanzi removed his disguise, he hovered in the air, donned in white clothes with a purple flower blooming on his right shoulder.

“There’s actually no deities, no Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword. There’s also no so-called ‘strongest holy land since ancient times’,” Tian Xuanzi muttered to himself.

Many people had already guessed his identity, but they were shocked to see him stepping forth. After all, Tian Xuanzi was a legendary figure who didn’t have any opponents when he challenged the five other holy lands. As a result, Tian Xuanzi was known to be invincible beneath the Emperor Realm.

Many people were guessing that Tian Xuanzi had reached a critical stage, and he was only one step away from reaching the Emperor Realm. He was the strongest genius in the past thousand years, and his presence made everyone present feel a great pressure. This was because Tian Xuanzi was too perfect, and he was the new myth of the Kunlun Realm after the Nine Emperors.

The Saints of the Heavenly Dao Sect felt great pressure as they stood up and gathered behind the Thousand Plume Great Saint and Gale Rein Great Saint. When they looked at Tian Xuanzi, they had rage reflected in their eyes because Tian Xuanzi was too arrogant. It had been a long time since someone dared to be so arrogant within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

The seven that came with Tian Xuanzi also removed their disguises. They were the infamous Black Mountain’s Seven Saints of the Eastern Desolation. When the seven of them appeared, no one was surprised because everyone knew that Tian Xuanzi had a good relationship with the seven saints.

“Thousand Plume Great Saint, am I right?” Tian Xuanzi smiled, looking at the Thousand Plume Great Saint. His expression was gentle, but he gave all the Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples a great pressure that made them feel suffocating.

There was a hint of rage within the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s eyes, but he coldly said, “Our fight should be after the ceremony. that’s what we have agreed upon.”

Tian Xuanzi helplessly smiled, “I can’t help it because the ceremony is too boring. I was looking forward to seeing if that brat could recall the Emperor Sword. Since I can’t see it, I might as well stop waiting. I believe the fight between us is more interesting than the ceremony.”

Tian Xuanzi has defeated the other holy lands within the Eastern Desolation? Lin Yun was shocked since he was in seclusion during this period of time, and he didn’t know what was happening in the outside world. He only knew from his senior brother that Tian Xaunzi had set off, but he didn’t expect Tian Xuanzi to come to the Heavenly Dao Sect so quickly. Was there really no one capable of stopping him beneath the Emperor Realm?

Lin Yun raised his head to look at Tian Xuanzi and clenched his fists together, feeling a great pressure coming from the latter.

“As you wish. I’ll continue the ceremony after defeating you. I won't waste too much time, anyways.” The Thousand Plume Great Saint looked at Tian Xuanzi indifferently.

The Dao Yang Holy Son already knew about this battle, but he was still feeling nervous. He prayed in his heart that his master had to win.

“Very well.” Tian Xuanzi smiled as they looked at each other, and their auras began to accumulate. This was Tian Xuanzi’s last stop in weighing the Eastern Desolation. Zhuge Qingyun didn’t have the qualifications to be at the guest seats, but he was nervously watching this scene.

If Tian Xuanzi won this battle, he would be invincible beneath the Emperor Realm. He didn’t have much worry about his master’s strength, but he couldn’t help feeling nervous because this was the Heavenly Dao Sect, the strongest holy land within the Eastern Desolation.
