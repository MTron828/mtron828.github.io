Chapter 930 - Fame Spreading Out!

Lin Yun sighed after he confirmed that Yuan Hengtian was gone. Then, his body relaxed and blood could be seen dripping from his hand. Although the Divine Sun Breaking Seal managed to destroy Yuan Hengtian’s advanced fortune martial technique, it wasn’t easy on him since there was a huge difference in cultivation.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The bones in his right hand were cracked because of this. In fact, he had reached his limit when he killed the last cultivator from the Bloodbone Realm. If Yuan Hengtian wanted to continue fighting, Lin Yun wasn’t sure if he could have put up a fight. However, he knew that Yuan Hengtian wouldn’t dare to gamble with his life like that even if he had a feeling that Lin Yun was in a bad state. After all, Lil’ Red was around and would have torn Yuan Hengtian to pieces.

Lil’ Red might seem greedy, but it only resorted to those means to give Yuan Hengtian a warning. It needed to protect Lin Yun at all costs.

“I have to reach the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm quickly,” said Lin Yun with determination. He needed to undergo his first tribulation for his foundation to be displayed. With his current strength, it was too dangerous for him to face the geniuses on the Azure Dragon Ranking.

Unlike the geniuses who could rely on their realm if they failed, Lin Yun would die if he failed. He needed adequate strength to protect himself.

“Let’s go.” After Lil’ Red took all the interspatial pouches, they left the ship. Initially, they wanted to take the ship to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, but it was too dangerous now. With his identity exposed, he was forced to take the exhausting path.

In the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm’s Bloodbone Dragon City, many of the Bloodbone Realm’s geniuses were gathered. Although the city was well known, the reputation of Bloodbone Dragon City came from the strength of the Bloodbone Realm itself.

Bloodbone Dragon City wasn’t just limited to the Bloodbone Realm. There were also other lower realms and higher realms that were gathered. However, the higher realms didn’t dare to utter a single word about the Bloodbone Realm using the city as their stronghold.

All of this forged the reputation of the Bloodbone Realm and made them stand out among the other higher realms. However, the Bloodbone Realm’s reputation was no longer stable. First, Feng Wuji died and his dao artifact was seized. It wasn’t even from another higher realm, but an unknown swordsman.

The Bloodbone Realm retaliated by sending someone from the Azure Dragon Ranking. They thought it would be enough to deal with Lin Yun, but nothing went according to plan. Instead, they received news that two elites from the Bloodbone Realm were killed while Yuan Hengtian was stripped naked by a cat.

When the news came back, it had undoubtedly caused a huge uproar in the city. How could Yuan Hengitan, a genius on the Azure Dragon Ranking, be defeated?

An Azure Dragon Ranking expert could suppress those in the same cultivation. So how could he have lost to Lin Yun who wasn’t even in the first soul?

No one believed the news in the beginning because it defied all logic. However, when Yuan Hengtian came back alone, the entire Bloodbone Dragon City realized the truth. They couldn’t believe that Yuan Hengtian was actually defeated by Lin Yun.

Although the two elites that accompanied Yuan Hengtian weren’t on the Azure Dragon Ranking, they were in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. They were killed despite their power. But even more unbelievable was Lin Yun’s challenge against the entire Bloodbone Realm!

“What impudence!” Everyone from the Bloodbone Realm felt rage when they heard Yuan Hengtian’s words. Even the yellow-clothed youth who sat in the main seat almost threw up blood.

“Where did you find the face to come back!” The yellow-clothed youth gritted his teeth. After all, it was embarrassing for the Bloodbone Realm to have their Azure Dragon Ranking genius come back to the stronghold naked. It was so humiliating that they would never live it down.

Yuan Hengtian was ashamed and lowered his head, “Lin Yun sent me back to tell you that he’ll challenge our Bloodbone Realm ten days from now. We can send out any genius we want to resolve the grudge between us.”

When the Bloodbone Realm cultivators heard that, they thought that Lin Yun was insane. Lin Yun basically offended everyone present.

“Is there a need for that?” The yellow-clothed youth stood up and emitted a chilling aura. “We already heard all of this before you came back. I was hoping you would tell me that everything I heard was fake… but you’re telling me that it was real? This is an unprecedented humiliation for our Bloodbone Realm!”

The yellow-clothed youth couldn’t take it anymore and pushed his palm out at Yuan Hengtian. Flying across the hall, Yuan Hengtian crashed into a stone pillar and fell to the ground. However, he got on his knees and didn’t utter a single word of complaint.

The yellow-clothed youth casually punished Yuan Hengtian, but his palm was heavy because he was in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

“Trash!” As if he wasn’t satisfied with Yuan Hengtian, he started cursing. Then, he looked around and asked, “Who’s willing to take Lin Yun’s life on my behalf ten days from now?”

Silence filled the hall because no one was confident they could deal with Lin Yun after seeing Yuan Hengtian’s state. After all, there weren’t many people stronger than Yuan Hengtian among the Bloodbone Realm’s party.

Just when the yellow-clothed youth’s face began to turn cold with rage, a voice sounded out from a youth wearing black and red. “Leave it to me.”

It was Kong Xuan, who was ranked 46th on the Azure Dragon Ranking and in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm. He was the second strongest person from the Bloodbone Realm.

The yellow-clothed youth was surprised when Kong Xuan spoke up, “Is there a need for that? It’s just Lin Yun. You’re giving him too much face to handle him yourself.”

“Indeed, there’s no need for that. Senior Brother Liu, Senior Brother Kong, let me deal with Lin Yun.” Another person stood up to volunteer. It was Pan Yuan, who was ranked 67th on the Azure Dragon Ranking and in the pinnacle second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. He could undergo his third tribulation any time and was the third strongest person in the Bloodbone Realm.

Obviously, he was a lot weaker than Kong Xuan and Liu Mu, so he was the most appropriate person to face Lin Yun. This was the line of thinking that everyone had, but he really didn’t want to do it. He would undergo his third tribulation soon and didn’t want to have any accidents. However, he wasn’t left with many choices since Kong Xuan was volunteering.

“No. Lin Yun might not be your opponent, but it’s also impossible for you to suppress him. Since my Bloodbone Realm is being humiliated, we have to win beautifully,” smiled Kong Xuan. “Not only do we need to crush him, but we also have to destroy his will and make him a slave of our Bloodbone Realm. If we simply kill him, we’ll be a laughing stock in the eyes of the other realms when the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm opens."

After hearing the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, Liu Mu’s face changed, “Alright then. You’ll deal with Lin Yun. I want everyone to know the might of our Bloodbone Realm!”

When the news of the Bloodbone Realm accepting Lin Yun’s challenge got out, Bloodbone Dragon City trembled violently. Shortly after, the news spread throughout the entire Azure Dragon Region.

It was too shocking to hear that someone was challenging an entire realm by themselves. It made everyone wonder who Lin Yun was.

When news got out that Lin Yun claimed he only needed one sword to kill, it instantly made everyone’s heart boil. Despite the pursuit of a higher realm, Lin Yun didn’t run.

As for Lin Yun, he found a quiet mountain range to make preparations for his first tribulation. The valley he found was enveloped in bright light along with dense astral energy that created different phenomena in the valley.

In the small valley, 1,000 stars were blooming like bewitching flowers. Additionally, there were 1,000 divine astral pellets that were manifested into different phenomena. If one’s cultivation wasn’t enough, they would be incinerated to flames by the divine astral pellets.

1,000 divine astral pellets were equivalent to 10,000,000 astral pellets, which was an unimaginable sum. If geniuses on the Azure Dragon Ranking underwent their third tribulation, they would probably only use about seven to ten million ordinary astral pellets. However, none of them would be insane enough to use that many for their first tribulation. It was no different from courting death.

“I’ve cultivated two sword sutras, I have the Azure Dragon Battle Physique, and I have the immortal spiritual sword intent. I should be able to refine 1,000 divine astral pellets without any worry. But I’ll be facing the Bloodbone Realm seven days from now and 1,000 divine astral pellets might not be enough…” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he debated adding 500 more divine astral pellets.
