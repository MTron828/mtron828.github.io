Chapter 2240 - Past and Present

The upcoming trip became smoother with the Asura Dove King leading. Firstly, he knew where the forbidden grounds were and could avoid them, saving a lot of time. Secondly, he was a Blood Crow King and could communicate with other Blood Crow Kings to avoid unnecessary battles. The Asura Dove King could even make a move if they ran into demonic beasts or monsters.

Not knowing if there were other reasons, the Asura Dove King recovered most of his strength after Lin Yun removed the Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent from his body.

“His strength will be fully recovered one day, and it will be dangerous at that time,” Lil’ Purple said.

Over the past few days, the Asura Dove King revealed his fearsome side. He wasn’t lenient to those weak Blood Crows. As the Rahu Sword absorbed blood, it faintly showed signs of recovering to the peak. The aura that the Asura Dove King gave off became even more powerful, and he was no longer as humble.

“I know,” Lin Yun replied.

“What are you planning?” Lil’ Purple asked.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I’m curious about what he’s trying to do. As for his strength, the stronger he is, the better,” Lin Yun smiled.

“You’re bold,” Lil’ Purple said. “That fellow will turn around to bite you when he can.”

“That’ll depend on his choice, then,” Lin Yun seemed confident.

It didn’t take long for Asura Dove King to return after scouting the way, and he respectfully said, “The Nether Thunder King has agreed to let us pass up ahead. After passing through his territory, we can swiftly reach the Blood Flame Plains. I even heard from him that many forces have gathered at the Blood Flame Plains. Amongst the holy lands of the Eastern Desolation, the Ming Cult is the strongest and has destroyed many holy land disciples. The Blood Moon Sect is approaching as well.”

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised because they were all here for the divine blood and Divine Blood Fruit. They would naturally bring as many people as possible.

Lin Yun was a Quasi-Saint, and thanks to the Asura Dove King, he could make such swift progress. He suddenly thought of something and asked, “Asura Dove King, I have a question for you.”

“Go on. I will tell you everything I know,” the Asura Dove King smiled.

Lin Yun briefly pondered, then he asked, “I fought some demonic corpses before, but they’re not as strong as I’d imagined. They might seem strong, but they can be easily resolved if I bear the saint's aura.”

“I do know a little about that. The Demonspirit Clan’s conversion of demonic corpses is a long process, and those demonic corpses had to be further tempered,” the Asura Dove King smiled. “According to the Demonspirit Clan, the demonic corpses had to be constantly tempted and eliminated before they gradually become powerful. The strongest can even recover half of their strength when they are alive and might even possess intelligence. But that will require a lot of divine blood and other resources.”

“What about the Blood Crows?” Lin Yun asked.

“We’re different from the Demonspirit Clans. We can be considered parasites and emergence. We’re born from divine blood and can fuse with the corpses in the Heavenly Void. There’s also a certain danger,” the Asura Dove King smiled.

“You can have the memories of the corpses you take over?” Lin Yun asked.

The Asura Dove King’s heart skipped a beat, but he said without a change on his face,” Fragments of it, such as marital techniques. But most of them are blurred.”

Lin Yun nodded, saying, “Let’s go, then.”

The Asura Dove King heaved in relief since he wondered if Lin Yun had discovered something. He quickly led the way for the group.

One day later, they passed through the Nether Thunder King’s territory and were at the outer region of the Blood Flame Plains. Lin Yun stood on a peak as he looked at the surrounding gathered forces.

A woman wearing a crimson dress appeared with phoenix patterns embroidered on the dress, making her look stunning, like the stars. The moment she appeared, she attracted all the surrounding gazes. She was the little princess of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, Ji Zixi.

Aside from her were the Saints of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, and they all gave off a powerful aura. When they arrived, many people in the surroundings felt fearful of them.

“It looks like the Divine Phoenix Mountain is determined to obtain the divine flames,” Lin Yun muttered. The Divine Phoenix Mountain was famous in the Eastern Desolation, and they could be considered the strongest now, it’s just that they kept a low profile.

Ji Zixi was a genius, and she was probably trying to find an opportunity with the great change coming. Even as the Divine Phoenix Mountain princess, she had to experience challenges to become a true phoenix.

“Lin Yun, look!” Lil’ Purple exclaimed as she pointed in a direction.

When Lin Yun turned his head over, his face changed as he saw the Blood Moon Divine Son, Zhao Tianyu. After some time of not seeing him, he noticed that Zhao Tianyu was giving off an even more powerful aura and had already become a Saint. Ten-odd people were around him. They must be Saint Elders of the Blood Moon Sect.

“Divine Son, this is the Blood Flame Plains. The divine flame should be here. This is also the heart of the deity’s corpse, and there will be many saint elixirs here. But the Blood Flame King is terrifying, and he also has many subordinates who are at the Saint Realm. If we enter, the dangers cannot be estimated,” a Saint Elder said, looking at Zhao Tianyu respectfully.

Since Zhao Tianyu had just reached the Saint Realm, he had a high requirement for saint elixirs. He said, “Opportunities often accompany danger. We have to go there, no matter what.”

He didn’t hesitate as he charged towards the Blood Flame Plains with the Blood Moon Sect’s party.

Lin Yun watched from afar and held back from charging over with great difficulty. His speculation was right; since the Blood Moon Sect was here, Su Ziyao was probably in the Blood Flame Plains. But where could she be?

Lin Yun frowned. He might feel that Su Ziyao would be fine, but he couldn’t help worrying about her. After all, Su Ziyao had never been in such a dangerous position, according to his impression, and the Blood Flame Plains wasn’t a good place to be, either.

“We’re already here, and I won’t be going in,” the Asura Dove King said carefully. He had already recovered to his peak, and no saint aura was left in his body. He was cautious and examined his body several times to see if Lin Yun left behind any traps.

Even after confirming that there wasn’t any restriction, he still didn’t dare to make a move because he felt that Lin Yun looked confident. He felt that there must be a restriction left in his body, it’s just that he didn’t notice it, and his outcome would become terrible if he made a move.

“You’re not going?” Lil’ Purple asked in a surprised tone.

The Asura Dove King smiled, “The Blood Flame Plains is dangerous, not to mention there are those from the holy lands and the Blood Moon Sect. I might die terribly if I go in, so I should stay out of this.”

He naturally wanted to go to the Blood Flame Plains so that he could slay Lin Yun if the latter was in danger. He could snatch the Othershore Flower and the mysterious sword box at that time. But he ultimately gave up because the risks were too high.

Lin Yun might seem young, but he was deep and unfathomable. So, he didn’t want to get involved with Lin Yun any further.

“You sure? The Blood Flame Plains might be dangerous, but there are also treasures. I can tell you’re not far from making a breakthrough,” Lin Yun said, looking at the Azure Dove King.

The Azure Dove King was shocked and even more confident in his decision of not to get involved with Lin Yun. He replied, “I won’t be going any further. You just have to undo the restriction in my body. I won’t ask for more of the Mandala Flower. I have also done my best to bring you here without any complaints, as you can see.”

Nodding his head, Lin Yun said, “Okay, you can stay behind then. I didn’t leave any restrictions on your body because I only know of the Nether Shackles. You can see if there’s any nether energy in your body if you don’t believe me.”

The Azure Dove King opened his mouth as he looked at Lin Yun with disbelief, and the latter didn’t seem to be lying. His eyes began to flicker, and his gaze became eerie.

Seeing his hesitation, Lin Yun smiled, “You might have a chance to win if you make a move now, but there’s a high chance that you’ll die. Do you know why I didn’t kill you and even gave you the Mandala Fragrance? You think I might’ve left a restriction in your body to control you, but I didn’t. A swordsman will never lie to another swordsman.”

The Azure Dove King never thought about that before.

“When you fought with me earlier, did you use the Overlord Sword?” Lin Yun asked.

“How do you know about it?” The Azure Dove King was alarmed.

“As expected,” Lin Yun replied. The sword technique that the Azure Dove King used was familiar and he fell into deep thoughts when his memories surfaced in his mind.

The Azure Dove King was performing the ancient saint section of the Overlord Sword, but it was incomplete. The Overlord Sword was a sword technique that Lin Yun practiced back in the Sword Firmament Pavilion, and the inheritance came from the Sword Sect. This meant that the body the Azure Dove King was using must belong to a Saint Elder of the Sword Sect at their prime, a Sword Saint!

“How do you know about that?” The Azure Dove King was shocked.

Lin Yun smiled, “How do I know? You only know that I’m Flower Burial, but did you know that I’m a disciple of Radiant and a disciple of the Sword Sect? In terms of seniority, I should call you ancestor, instead.”

The Azure Dove King was shocked as he looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.

“The Mandala Fragrance can help you recover your body's memories, increasing your strength and comprehension. This should be the secret you’re trying to hide,” Lin Yun said. He looked at the Azure Dove King with a complicated gaze because the Sword Sect was the strongest sect of swordsmen back then, but they joined that ancient battle.

Ultimately, the Sword Sect was no longer a holy land, and they might even lose their last Sword Saint.

The Azure Dove King was shocked because he didn’t expect Lin Yun to discover the secrets he kept hidden so well, and he never expected there would be so many twists and turns. A long time later, he sighed, “I didn’t lie to you. I’m not a senior from the Sword Sect, I’m only Azure Dove King. I merely occupied this body with some fragmented memories. I’m really not…”

Lin Yun interrupted the Azure Dove King, and said, “I know. There are ten droplets of Mandala Fragrance here, and you can use them yourself. It will depend on your luck to see how much strength you can recover. I won’t pursue what you did in the past, but you’re not allowed to harm anyone from the Sword Sect when you go to the Kunlun Realm. Otherwise, I will end your life personally.”
