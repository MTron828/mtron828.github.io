Chapter 799 - Lin Tao's Death!

Sensing Lin Yun’s fighting spirit, Lin Tao sneered, “You’re so ignorant even when facing death. My next attack is something I preserved for four years for the three kings. If you can take it, I’ll admit defeat. The name of this punch is Thousand Absolute Sun Devourer!”

Lin Tao clenched his fist and the violent aura surged even more on his body. As he pushed the Profound Yang Art to the limit, the sky began to roll violently. The sky gradually turned into a boundless sea of flames.

Flames crackled in the sky while surges of terrifying aura gathered on Lin Tao’s fist. Soon, his fist radiated like a star. A powerful flaming pressure emitted from Lin Tao that slowly suppressed the surrounding air. Even the surrounding space began to tremble violently.

Upon looking at this scene, the spectators’ faces changed greatly. Many Heavenly Soul Realm experts also became nervous at this moment because the phenomenon was too terrifying.

“What power!” Everyone from the Great Qin Empire became worried. Even Yue Weiwei became nervous.

“Two years ago, when this punch hadn’t reached its limit, I suffered a loss when I fought Lin Tao. There’s no way Lin Yun can block this attack!” Yan Long’zi had excitement on his face when he saw this scene.

In his view, Lin Yun would lose the ability to fight even if he didn’t face the punch head-on. This meant that Lin Yun would lose his qualification to be promoted and would eventually be forgotten.

As Lin Tao’s attack continued to accumulate, boundless pressure came crashing onto Lin Yun. At this moment, the difference in their cultivation was clear. But Lin Yun didn’t bring out his spiritual sword intent nor did he have any panic on his face.

Lin Yun’s dragon runes squirmed around before a few dragons actually flew out of his body. The dragons coiled around Lin Yun as they roared furiously. At the same time, Lin Yun’s eyes turned red while he generated an immense killing aura.

Seven Slaughtering Fist!

His aura made him look like an asura from hell, but for some reason, Lin Yun’s pupils were calming to look at.

Lin Tao was also done preparing his attack. His fist emitted a crimson ray that looked like it would incinerate everything. The crimson ray pierced through Lin Yun’s killing aura before Lin Yun could do anything, causing the lightning dragons to howl from the crimson flames.

“Not good!” The spectators became nervous as Lin Tao stole the advantage.

Wearing a sinister smile, Lin Tao barked, “Die!”

This was his strongest attack. Empowered by the Profound Yang Battle Physique, he finally revealed his most terrifying side. In that split second, the light from his fist incinerated everything in the entire sky and plunged the stage into darkness. At this moment, it looked like the sun had been devoured. Neither cloud nor sunlight remained.

This attack was similar to Lin Yun’s Solar Slash. However, Lin Tao’s punch was even more domineering since it also devoured sunlight.

“You qualified for me to use the last form of the Seven Slaughtering Fist.” Unlike other people who were panicking, Lin Yun’s heart was composed as he executed the seventh form of the Seven Slaughtering Fist—Endless Slaughter!

The pitch black killing aura behind him condensed into an ancient word, ‘杀’. When the word appeared, Lin Yun’s aura grew frantically until it reached the Heavenly Soul Realm. Then, the sky and stage trembled violently as if doomsday was coming. Simultaneously, the crowd heard countless people screaming the word kill into their ears.

Every time the voices would yell, ‘杀’ would grow even redder. After seven screams, Lin Yun punched Lin Tao’s attack. Just like that, two breathtaking punches collided with the power to kill a Heavenly Soul Realm expert.

The Nine Dragon Lake began to tremble violently and the geniuses fighting on the other stages felt an immense pressure. When Lin Tao and Lin Yun’s attacks collided, the phenomenon that made the sky dark was destroyed.

Cracks also began to appear on the barrier that covered the stage as if it would shatter at any moment. But fortunately, the Sacred Alliance’s judge controlled the barrier so that the shockwave wouldn’t cause any deaths among the audience.

Even though no one died, the audience felt uncomfortable from the shockwave. After all, the shockwave was so strong that it put great pressure on the barrier. Just thinking about it made many people tremble because Lin Tao and Lin Yun weren’t even in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

Then, a figure dropped from the sky like a meteor.

“It’s Lin Yun!” In the end, Lin Tao relied on his advantage in his cultivation to win by half a move. After landing on the group, a huge crater was formed on the stage.

No one could tell if Lin Yun was alive. After all, who would have imagined that this battle would be so brutal. The crowd looked at the stage that was now in ruins with fear.

“That was too terrifying! Their killing attacks could definitely kill an ordinary Heavenly Soul Realm expert.”

“In the previous fight, Lin Yun clearly had the advantage. How could he have lost?”

“Lin Tao’s advantage in his cultivation is too great. It makes sense that he would have the last laugh. The foundation of the seven elites runs too deep.” Whispers sounded out from the seats as many people felt pity for Lin Yun.

When Lin Tao descended to the ground, cracks appeared on his body and blood flowed out his wounds. Clearly, Lin Yun hadn’t fully grasped the Seven Slaughtering Fist’s might.

“You’re courting death to force me to this spot!” Lin Tao’s face became sinister as killing aura poured out of his eyes.

A dragon roar echoed out of the rubble and the pile of rocks instantly turned into dust. Lin Yun stood up with close to a hundred dragon runes on his body.

Lightning exploded as Lin Yun clenched his fist together. He was gathering all the dragon runes onto his fist, which turned his right arm into a ferocious dragon head. Then, with a terrifyingly fast punch, he sent Lin Tao flying.

The magma that covered Lin Tao exploded and he was left defenseless. Lin Tao spit up blood from the damage that Lin Yun gave him. All it took was one punch to break his Profound Yang Battle Physique.

“You lost.” Lin Yun stood with his hands behind his back as he looked at Lin Tao calmly.

“That’s impossible! How can I possibly lose to someone like you?! I’m someone who will claim the quota and compete with the three kings. How can I possibly lose to you?!” Lin Tao’s eyes went insane as he couldn’t accept the outcome. Then, he began to circulate his Profound Yang Art.

The cracked magma gathered onto his body once more as he charged towards Lin Yun.

“Sword!” Lin Yun raised his brow and summoned his sword from afar, which turned into a streak of light and flew into his hand. Lin Yun sheathed his sword as a sword ray flashed, splitting Lin Tao in two. Although he sheathed his sword as soon as he attacked, the sword was still trembling incessantly. His sword intent was truly too powerful.

Everything happened in a split second. As Lin Tao’s corpse fell to the ground, Lin Yun stood majestically as his hair fluttered in the wind.
