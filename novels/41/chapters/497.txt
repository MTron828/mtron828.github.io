Chapter 498 - A Chaotic Battle

It was a spectacular scene to see the indigoflame pouring down. Some people even felt the urge to touch it, but no one was stupid enough to do it. They could sense the terrifying energy contained in the indigoflame and that they would be reduced to ashes if they weren’t careful. In the next second, the surface of the Indigocloud Lake turned into a sea of flames.

The Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples also gradually calmed down. They all knew that there would be a battle awaiting them. When they looked at the heart of the lake, the Indigoflame Goldlotuses began to tremble violently and transform.

Not only them, but the other sects also stared at the Indigoflame Goldlotuses. The Indigoflame Goldlotuses were like jade, ethereal as they basked in the indigoflames. With just a glance, Lin Yun could sense his origin energy being attracted by the Indigoflame Goldlotuses.

It was an innate desire, especially since he was in the quasi-Violat Palace Realm. For both his body and spirit, they were attracted to the Indigoflame Goldlotuses.

On the other hand, Liu Yunyan was more calm. She only needed the Indigoflame Goldlotuses to complete her mission and become a core disciple.

As everyone looked at the Indigocloud Lake, their eyes were filled with desire. Suddenly, an Indigoflame Goldlotus began to bloom as it emitted dazzling golden radiance.

“One!” Everyone’s emotions rose to the peak when one Indigoflame Goldlotus matured. They were excited, but none of them moved because this was only the beginning. If they were lucky, they would have over ten matured Indigoflame Goldlotuses.

“That’s the Indigoflame Goldlotus?” Lin Yun was unusually calm when he looked at the lotuses. But he wasn’t as calm as he seemed. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Two!”

“Three!”

...

“Ten!”

One after another Indigoflame Goldlotuses began to mature, and when it reached the tenth one, the indigoflames began to die down as the unmatured ones were incinerated into ashes on the lake.

“It looks like there are only ten of them.” Everyone was rather disappointed because in the past, there were at least fifteen of them and at most thirty of them. But since there were only ten, this meant that this would be even more brutal.

But no one acted rashly because they knew that anyone who stood out right now would be targeted by everyone. All of them looked at each other with fake smiles, waiting for the first person to stand out.

But right at this moment, ten-odd lesser Yin stage elite demonic beasts charged from the rear, catching everyone by surprise. The demonic beasts released violent energy and when they landed on the lake, the indigoflames instantly converged on them. They were being injured by the indigoflames, but they still madly charged at the matured Indigoflame Goldlotuses.

“Let’s go!” The Shattered Sword Pavilion couldn’t maintain their composure anymore, along with the Bloodwing Pavilion.

“Damn it, we can’t let the demonic beasts ruin the Indigoflame Goldlotuses!” Han Fei of the Threesolute Manor’s face changed at this scene. If human cultivators got the lotuses, they could try and snatch it from them. But demonic beasts would immediately devour those lotuses. They finally couldn’t maintain their composure any longer as they charged over.

“Kill!” Liu Yunyan also charged forward without any hesitation. In the next second, the lake was full of slaughtering. All the human cultivators placed their targets on the demonic beasts, and they decided to deal with the demonic beasts before going for the lotuses.

“Interesting…” Looking at all the forces going after the demonic beasts, Ye Cangming sneered inwardly. He also made his move as he retrieved a black spear and charged at the demonic beasts. His spear was like a meteorite that streaked across the horizon and knocked a lesser Yin stage demonic beast back.

“That spear technique is rather impressive.” Lin Yun was surprised by Ye Cangming’s attack. At the same time, he understood why this fellow was still alive despite betraying his sect. The sword technique was domineering and fast. It could catch any opponent at the same cultivation by surprise. Once Ye Cangming made his move, no one stood by the lakeside anymore.

Liu Yunyan looked at Lin Yun, “Remember to preserve your strength. You still have to hold back Leng Yi and create an opportunity for me when the time is right. Then, I’ll take the Indigoflame Goldlotuses.”

“As you wish.” Lin Yun was rather calm. He knew that he didn’t have to keep up his guard against Leng Yi. There were many people here and someone would eventually make a move. So he was just waiting to see who would make the first move.

“What powerful indigoflame…” Lin Yun could sense the heatwave coming from the lake. Just standing here made him feel terrible and he couldn’t imagine what would happen if he fell in it. But thankfully, he had the Dracophant Battle Physique, so it wasn’t as bad for him as those who needed to shroud themselves with their origin energy. Compared to demonic beasts who were born with powerful defences, human cultivators were in a disadvantageous position here.

Right at this moment, the battle on the lake had reached its pinnacle. No one wanted the demonic beasts to ruin the Indigoflame Goldlotuses. There were only ten of them, so losing even one would make everyone feel a heartache.

There were also those who tried to approach the Indigoflame Goldlotuses sneakily, but before they could even get close, they were sent flying by the golden flames from the Indigoflame Goldlotuses and then killed by demonic beasts.

Treasures like the Indigoflame Goldlotuses had spirituality upon maturity, so they wouldn’t let anyone pluck them so easily. The flames that they possessed were powerful.

Fresh blood began to spread out on the lake as time slowly passed. The demonic beasts also gradually fell into a disadvantageous position. But the demonic beasts didn’t just sit there and get killed. They also started to put their lives on their line as they attacked.

As the demonic beasts began to put their lives on the line, they became even harder to deal with, not to mention that they were elite demonic beasts. So they didn’t just have power, but also intelligence.

Blood started to splatter on the lake, gradually dying the entire lake red.

“The demonic beasts are hard to deal with.” Many sects’ disciples were having a hard time with the demonic beasts. Once Liu Yunyan killed a demonic beast, another demonic beast pounced at her before she could even catch her breath.

This caught Liu Yunyan by surprise, but it was already too late for her to make her move. She would be injured unless she used spiritual runes, but it was clearly not worth it for her to reveal her trump card so early.

Right at this moment, a golden ray charged over as Lin Yun threw a punch out. His punch instantly sent the demonic ape flying away. When he landed on the surface of the lake, he caused a splash.

“Thanks,” said Liu Yunyan after a brief moment of hesitation.

Lin Yun smiled in response. It wasn’t easy for Liu Yunyan to do that. Lin Yun then pointed his hand in a direction, “Look there.”

Liu Yunyan looked and saw Leng Yi blowing his flute. As he blew his flute, two demonic apes charged at the Heavenly Province Academy’s direction.

“Damn it!” Liu Yunyan was enraged when she saw this scene.

Leng Yi placed his flute down with a cold sneer. He then returned to Pan Yue’s side. Pan Yue smiled, “Liu Yunyan, I’ll be going ahead. You can continue to have fun with the demonic beasts!”
