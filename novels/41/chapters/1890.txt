Chapter 1891 - Shameless

“A piece of garbage managed to rise after one year?” A clear voice resounded as a youth with a robust figure stepped forth. He strolled to the stone pillar and helped Chen Jun from the ground. Although he didn’t circulate his dragon origin, everyone could sense that the tremendous pressure that was coming from him was like a volcano.

“Senior Brother Zhang, you’re back!” Chen Jun rejoiced when he saw this person.

“Senior Brother Zhang!” Even the depressed Luo Cheng ran over in excitement.

On the other hand, those from the Indigo Thunder Peak panicked, with their faces becoming pale. Chen Feng muttered, “Why is this madman back?”

While everyone was shocked, more people walked over to Zhang Yue, and the atmosphere became lively.

“Senior Brother Zhang is back!”

“Finally! Someone who can teach Ye Qingtian a lesson!”

“He had already gotten on my nerves.” Zhang Yue wasn’t only a saint disciple but also a saint’s disciple. This meant that his master was a significant figure within the Heavenly Dao Sect. Zhang Yue was strong before becoming a saint disciple and was ranked within the top ten amongst the saint disciples in the Dao Yang Palace. He was young, and his name was on the Eastern Desolation’s King Ranking.

Most importantly, he had a feud with Ye Qingtian. When Ye Qingtian was expelled from the sect a year ago, Zhang Yue taught Ye Qingtian a lesson outside the Heavenly Dao Sect, nearly crippling the latter. It was rumored that Ye Qingtian’s dragon pulses were nearly severed, and he left the Heavenly Dao Sect by crawling.

“Zhang Yue?” Lin Yun raised his head when he heard this name. He had heard this name multiple times within the Heavenly Dao Sect and finally saw the person in question now.

“Senior Brother, let’s go,” Chen Feng said with his head lowered.

Lin Yun was looking at Zhang Yue. The latter was pretty decent to reach the Nirvana Stage at his age, but he wasn’t too sure how far Zhang Yue had gone at the Nirvana Stage. He should be lower than the third transformation of the Nirvana Stage, which was already terrifying.

“Leaving so soon? You’re not planning to greet me?” Zhang Yue said with a playful smile.

“We greet Senior Brother Zhang!” Chen Feng cupped his hands together.

“It’s your turn, Ye Qingtian. Do you remember what you said a year ago? I don’t mind reminding you, if you’ve forgotten. I remembered you said that you’ll bark like a dog and kowtow whenever you see me in the future!” Zhang Yue smiled. He was arrogant and had no intentions of giving Ye Qingtian any face.

His words naturally caused an uproar, and they all turned to look at Ye Qingtian with playful gazes. They wanted to see how Ye Qingtian would resolve this matter today.

“Senior Brother Zhang, that person was flirting with Bai Shuying at the Nether Orchid Courtyard when you were not around,” Luo Cheng said.

“I already heard about that, and that’s why I’m here. It appears that Ye Qingtian has a poor memory,” Zhang Yue coldly said. As he spoke, he took a step forth, instantly making all the disciples within the surrounding excited because Zhang Yue was personally going to make a move.

Lin Yun had proven his strength, but no one was optimistic about him facing Zhang Yue. After all, Zhang Yue was a saint’s disciple, which meant he could cultivate in the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. This was why he could reach the Nirvana Stage at a young age.

Zhang Yue wasn’t weak in his martial intent, either. Aside from that, Zhang Yue even possessed the Heavenly Flamespirit Physique, and he could be considered a monstrous genius within the Eastern Desolation.

Everyone from the Indigo Thunder Peak was frightened and didn’t dare to utter a word. But Lin Yun glanced at Zhang Yue and replied, “It’s true that I don’t have a good memory, and I’ve forgotten what happened a year ago. But who do you think you are? Get lost, or I don’t mind embarrassing you before Senior Sister Bai.”

Lin Yun’s words instantly caused an uproar, and everyone looked at Lin Yun as though they were looking at a madman.

“Holy shit, what did I just hear?”

“Ye Qingtian asked Zhang Yue to get lost. Did he think he’s invincible after obtaining the three stands of blue dragon sacred flame?”

“Senior Brother Zhang is at the Nirvana Stage and a saint’s disciple!”

Lin Yun’s words naturally caused an uproar, leaving all the Dao Yang Palace’s disciples dumbfounded.

“Senior Brother Zhang, you don’t have to dirty your hands on someone like him. I’ll teach him a lesson on your behalf.” A saint disciple from the Dao Yang Palace stood out. His name was Zhang Yi. He had long become a saint disciple three years ago, and his cultivation was at the pinnacle seventh channel of the Profound Death Stage. He might not be comparable to a saint's disciple, but he was pretty powerful amongst the saint disciples.

The fact that he was at the pinnacle of the Profound Death Stage alone was shocking enough. As he stepped forth, his hand manifested into a claw, and a ferocious bird appeared behind him. This was the Azurebird, a saint beast.

“Azurebird Skytearing Claw!” This was a ghost spirit martial technique of the Dao Yang Palace, derived from the ancient beast, the Azurebird. There were rumors that the Dao Yang Palace had an Azurebird Painting. So practicing the Azurebird Skytearing Claw by observing the Azurebird Painting would bring the power of this technique to a new height.

When the Azurebird spread its wings, fine cracks appeared in the surrounding air. This was a powerful martial technique; one would be torn into pieces if they weren’t careful. This technique was the bane of all body-refining cultivators, and it was effective against swordsmanship as well.

As long as Zhang Yi could comprehend the Azurebird Intent, he would be fearless against sword intent. Even a sharp sword intent would be torn into pieces before this martial technique.

Zhang Yi intended to use his martial techniques and cultivation advantage to suppress Ye Qingtian. Even if Ye Qingtian could block his attack, he could quickly follow up and aim to suppress him. He didn’t believe Ye Qingtian could shatter his claw with one strike.

“Looks pretty terrifying, but it’s a pity that you’re lacking in the Azurebird Intent. It’s sufficient to deal with the weak, but it’s nothing but a joke before a true expert!” Lin Yun calmly commented and reached out with his hand. When two sword rays were shot out from his fingertips, the eyes of the Azurebird behind Zhang Yi were instantly blinded, making the Azurebird scream out in pain.

“Kneel and submit to me!” Lin Yun reached out and executed the Azure Dragon Grasp. A mighty azure dragon's aura spread out as a thunderstorm vortex appeared on his palm. Before anyone could look closer, Lin Yun waved his hand down, and the Azurebird fell to the ground under the dragon aura.

Zhang Yi was horrified that he could no longer control the Azurebird Skytearing Claw, and was suffocating under the immense pressure. He clearly had a higher cultivation than Lin Yun, but Lin Yun easily suppressed him.

When he tried to resist, Lin Yun loosened his grasp and made Zhang Yi throw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away. This was like Lin Yun pressing down on his head, and he was trying his best to resist. But when Lin Yun suddenly let go, he was naturally sent flying away under his strength.

When he got back up, the Azurebird phenomenon had shattered, and his face had become pale. The surroundings immediately fell silent as everyone took a deep breath while looking at Ye Qingtian.

Zhang Yi’s cultivation was much higher than Ye Qingtian’s, but Ye Qingtian easily toyed with Zhang Yi like an adult messing around with a kid. This was too terrifying, and this had far exceeded their imagination.

“Ye Qingtian!” When everyone was shocked, Zhang Yi dashed forth and no longer suppressed his cultivation. The pressure he gave off was terrifying. After all, he was four channels higher than Lin Yun’s cultivation.

Seeing Zhang Yi charging forth, Lin Yun took a deep breath and circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. As black petals flew out from his body, they formed a black flower that swiftly expanded. By the time Zhang Yi got close, he had circulated the eighth stage of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to the limit.

The flower had seventy-two petals, and Lin Yun’s nether energy easily corroded the dragon origin around Zhang Yi. But that wasn’t all. Lin Yun then summoned the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron from the dragon origin ocean, and a terrifying power gushed out, filling his body.

As a crimson demonic light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, he clasped his hands together before pushing his right palm forth. When Lin Yun’s palm came in contact with Zhang Yi’s palm, the latter threw out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying away. But Lin Yun was unmoving and was enveloped in nether energy.

Everyone in the surroundings was shocked because they never expected that Zhang Yi would lose from a frontal confrontation. The only explanation was that Ye Qingtian was stronger than Zhang Yi and could fight the latter, who was four channels above him.

“The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra!”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Did the Azure River Sword Saint teach him that? I thought this sword sutra was hard to practice, so how did Ye Qingtian reach so high in it?”

“This is too terrifying…”

A brief moment later, a series of commotions came from the surroundings, and they all looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. He was only at the third channel of the Profound Death Stage and had just become a saint disciple. So how strong would he become if he became a saint’s disciple? Everyone could feel their scalps becoming numb, and they didn’t dare to think about it.

“Ye Qingtian has undergone countless difficulties, and he has transformed, breaking through the cocoon and soaring to the sky. He’s no longer a piece of trash now!” An old man outside the daofield sighed.

The faces of the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples turned red, with their pupils shining brightly. This was because Ye Qingtian was too strong in their eyes. Not only did he transform, he even rose from despair. How many people could accomplish that?

“Ye Qingtian, I have belittled you. Let us have some fun, then,” Zhang Yue sneered.

“Zhang Yue, how shameless can you be?” A voice resounded, coming from someone that no one had expected. Not long later, the voice’s owner came to Lin Yun’s side.
