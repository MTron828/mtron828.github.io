Chapter 1399 - Fury

Lin Yun’s smile was warm, but his smile made Jiang Tian feel a chill down his spine with his back covered in a cold sweat. For some reason, he could feel the danger that Lin Yun was giving him.

“Are you guys just going to watch?” Jiang Tian barked. When he was done, the six people stood up and pounced at Lin Yun. They were the princes in the various saint clans and were all at the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. So one could imagine how terrifying the momentum was.

As bolts of lightning flickered in the sky, the sky turned dark as though the apocalypse had arrived. This instantly made everyone at the foot of the mountain dumbfounded. They couldn’t believe that the six experts from the various saint clans would simultaneously make a move against Lin Yun. Judging from their momentum, they were clearly planning to suppress Lin Yun here, not giving Lin Yun the chance to join the Sword Sect. It was so much so that they even looked like they wanted to cripple him.

“Hahaha! I know that you’re angry, but what can you do? You have a good temper? What has your temper got to do with me? You’ve long been an eyesore hopping around in front of me!” Jiang Tian laughed as his sword radiated with sword rays, forming into a river.

The situation suddenly became unfavorable for Lin Yun as he faced the joined forces of the seven geniuses from the various saint clans. Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Art was strong but still weaker than Qin Cang’s. As long as he didn’t have a dragon bone, there would always be a flaw to his body-refining technique.

Lin Yun could be invincible when facing those at the same cultivation level, and he wouldn’t have to fear someone even if he met one or two Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts. But if he faced all seven simultaneously, he would at least be crippled if he took more than four of their attacks. Even if they had only formed one star, they were Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts, which meant that they were two stages above him.

“Junior Brother Lin!” Ye Ziling and the others suddenly became nervous. Lin Yun was too far away, and there was nothing they could do, even if they wanted to help. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

But Lin Yun was calm even in the face of danger. He turned around and executed the Azure Dragon Grasp. When he pushed his right palm out, the dragon runes instantly formed into a vortex in his palm that manifested into a dragon claw that descended from the sky, splitting the clouds apart in its path.

“Get back!” The six princes were surprised and gave up attacking Lin Yun, choosing to retreat. But they soon noticed a space distortion pulling them towards that dragon claw, even if they fled.

“Calm down. Let’s attack it together!” One of them calmly said.

The six then combined their attacks together and launched them at the dragon claw. Simultaneously, Jiang Tian’s sword stabbed Lin Yun’s right shoulder blade.

As fine cracks appeared on the dragon runes, Lin Yun flew into the sky under that attack and took several steps back. But Jiang Tian naturally didn’t want to give Lin Yun the time to recover and launched another attack on him.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, the dragon runes on the surface of his body manifested into an azure dragon that coiled around him, blocking the attack from Jiang Tian. When Lin Yun flicked his finger, his firmament sword intent easily sent Jiang Tian flying away.

But Lin Yun could still feel the pain coming from his shoulder blade. Right then, the dragon claw he had manifested shattered under waves of sword rays as the six princes hovered in the air.

“Six saint clans are ganging up on me?” Lin Yun smiled with his eyes growing even colder.

The prince of the Ji Saint Clan coldly said, “Don’t blame us for bullying you. You can only blame yourself for standing out too much. We already heard of your accomplishments before you came to the Ancient Barren Domain. Just Xiahou Yan was enough for us, so where will we stand if you rise as well?”

Lin Yun was speechless because he didn’t think that the reason for them to gang up on him would be so simple.

“If you want us to let you go, it’s simple. If you’re willing to expose the secret of the Great Saint Origin, then you won’t have any threat,” smiled the prince from the Wang Saint Clan.

“Why are we wasting time with him? Do you think he’ll hand the secret over? Just cripple him and force it out of his mouth!” The Guan Saint Clan’s prince coldly said.

The remaining three saint clans were the Zhang Saint Clan, Gong Saint Clan, and Liu Saint Clan. In addition to the three who previously spoke and the Jiang Saint Clan, they were all ranked in the top ten amongst the saint clans in the Ancient Barren Domain. Since they could become the prince of their saint clans, they were all on the Elysium Core Ranking. This also meant that it would be impossible for them to make it on the Elysium Core Ranking if they weren't from a saint clan.

As they hovered in mid-air, they were emitting dazzling lights with their innate saint auras. Their sword auras suddenly linked together, like seven skies overlapping before crashing down on Lin Yun.

The joined force of the seven Heavenly Elysium Core Realm was too powerful, and anyone standing under their sword aura would feel like they were facing an entire ocean. Their sword aura tore a hole in Lin Yun’s firmament sword intent. This made Lin Yun groan and take several steps back, blood dripping down on the corner of his lips as he fell to one of his knees.

“Lin Yun, I advise you to stop resisting. Do you think you can face all seven of us? As a fated transcendent, you should know that you have no odds of winning even if you’ve grasped the firmament sword intent!” Jiang Tian snorted.

But Lin Yun had no change on his face as he stood back up and wiped the blood off his lips. He wasn’t careful when facing the seven Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts, making him instantly pay the price.

His entire body was straight like a sword when he stood back up. He ignored Jiang Tian’s words and triggered the Golden Crow Saint Rune on his elysium core, circulating all seven strands of the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura.

When the seven auras came together in his violet palace, a vibration echoed as a boundless innate saint aura flowed out of Lin Yun’s pores. Not long later, the innate saint aura formed into a golden mist that enveloped Lin Yun.

As a heavenly dragon and divine phoenix appeared around Lin Yun, circling him, Lin Yun unleashed a powerful wave of sword aura that made the seven princes groan before they were sent flying back.

“What’s going on?”

“Why is his innate saint aura greater than all of us added together?!” The grey-clothed youth from the Guan Saint Clan exclaimed in surprise.

“Just cripple him!” Jiang Tian replied. He was the first to attack, combining his flame intent and sword intent again.

“Star Shattering Sword!” The prince of the Guan Saint Clan also unleashed his attack.

Simultaneously, the prince of the Zhang Saint Clan, Zhang Ming, emitted a desolate aura from his body, “Ocean Desolation 9 Swords!”
