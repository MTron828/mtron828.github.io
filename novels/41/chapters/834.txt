Chapter 835 - A Ray of Sword, Radiating for Millennials

As dawn expelled the darkness from the city, the last battle was beginning.

“Daybreak is finally here. I wonder if this will signal the birth of a new king or the continued reign of the old king,” muttered Nangong Wanyu as he squinted his eyes. Other people also stared at the rising sun with emotions in their eyes. They had no idea if the arrival of the sun was a coincidence or if it was fated to synchronize with the last battle.

The final battle was between Lin Yun and Yu Haotian. Lin Yun was the biggest underdog of the banquet with a surprising undefeated streak. His legend was built by killing many famous geniuses, including Yan Long’zi of the three kings. As a swordsman, he was practically perfect. His performance refreshed everyone’s understanding of swordsmen as he shocked the crowd time and again.

With his countless trump cards and terrifying sword talent, he even defeated someone like Zhao Wuji. There was no doubt in anyone’s mind that Lin Yun had performed wonderfully. As for Yu Haotian, he was a heaven-defying genius who never used more than half of his strength. He was the unquestioned king of the Ancient Southern Domain. Although Yan Long’zi and Zhao Wuji were part of the three kings, they couldn’t compare to him.

Yu Haotian’s existence overshadowed many people and he even disregarded the chief judge of the Sacred Alliance at one point without being punished. There was no question that these two were at the center of attention.

With a flash, Lin Yun landed on the stage with his sword box on his back.

“Admirable courage.” Yu Haotian sneered with disdain in his eyes. Taking a step forward, he enveloped the entire stage with his purple moonlight. Then, using his peculiar movement technique, he appeared on the stage in the blink of an eye.

“I know that you’re strong, but I still don’t see you as a threat. However, you really surprised me with your performance so far. I never thought that you would be the one to confront me in the end. I can’t believe that even Zhao Wuji was defeated by you, but that’s good because it will be more satisfying for me to crush you myself. Regardless, you’re still just an ant.” Yu Haotian stood with his hands behind his back, unleashing a domineering aura.

“What a powerful aura!”

“There were rumours about a grudge between Lin Yun and Qing Ruoyou. It looks like Yu Haotian wants to make a statement and kill Lin Yun for her.” Everyone was secretly alarmed by the domineering aura coming from Yu Haotian. After all, Yu Haotian’s strength was unfathomable.

At this moment, it felt like Yu Haotian could blow away a mountain with his aura. Lin Yun stood like a sharp sword on the stage as his clothes fluttered wildly in the air. However, there was contempt in the depths of his eyes. An ant?

“You shouldn’t be so confident. It’s still uncertain who will win,” said Lin Yun as he raised his brow.

“Wow, you’re ignorant even when facing death. An ant is still an ant. You have no chance in this battle. Your only fate is to be crushed by me!” Yu Haotian said as he curled his lips and looked at Lin Yun with even more disdain.

Suddenly, Yu Haotian’s body jolted and his origin energy roared. Like a bright star, his body emitted a purple glow.

Yu Haotian’s hair fluttered violently under his domineering aura as he prepared to crush heaven and earth.

“What the hell is that?”

“Isn’t his aura a little too terrifying? He truly is the king!”

“It’s the Heavenly Earth Overlord Art!” Yu Haotian’s domineering aura caused an uproar among the spectators. They realized that it was the long lost Heavenly Earth Overlord Art that belonged to the Sword Sect.

The Heavenly Earth Overlord Art was a powerful cultivation technique that the Sword Sect relied on to rule the Ancient Southern Domain. Neither the Indigomoon Elysium’s Indigomoon Sutra nor the Violet Thunder Sect’s Thundercloud Art could compare to the Heavenly Earth Overlord Art.

The Sword Sect had already been annihilated, but its legend as alive and well in the Ancient Southern Domain. When Yu Haotian brought out this cultivation technique, everyone lost confidence in Lin Yun. Even those from the Indigomoon Elysium sneered at Lin Yun. Although the Heavenly Earth Overlord Art was incomplete, it was more than enough for him to deal with Lin Yun.

“It doesn’t matter if you have the Overlord Sword or if I have the Overlord Fist. The true might of those techniques can only be brought out by the Heavenly Earth Overlord Art,” said Yu Haotian as he stepped forward. Then, Yu Haotian took a step forward.

Looking at this scene, everyone held their breath because Yu Haotian was finally going to attack.

“Come on then.” Lin Yun spoke calmly as the Flower Burial Sword buzzed within his sword box. He was like a sharp sword that stood tall within a blizzard.

Letting out a bark, Yu Haotian attacked, “Heaven and Earth Union!”

The entire stage trembled as cracks spread out on the ground. Lin Yun felt as if his whole world had been turned upside down as the surrounding air was distorted. It felt like Yu Haotian had merged heaven and earth together. Then, Yu Haotian threw out a punch that could obliterate Lin Yun.

Raising his hand, a dragon roar echoed out from Lin Yun’s sword box as a boundless sword ray entered his hand. As his sword intent reverberated, Lin Yun pulled out the Flower Burial Sword and empowered it with his quasi-spiritual sword intent. Seeing the quasi-spiritual sword intent once more, the crowd was shocked. It seemed even more deadly this time and looked like it could cut Yu Haotian’s attack apart.

“Overlord Sword–Thunderbolt Slash!” Eighteen thunderbolts gathered in the sky and formed an azure dragon. As the sky turned dark, the azure dragon then flew towards Yu Haotian’s punch.

A terrifying collision rang out as the surrounding aura became violent. Countless holes appeared on the barrier before it suddenly shattered. All of the spectators were shocked by this development.

Suddenly, everyone’s faces changed because they forgot about the shockwave. Everyone was forced to defend themselves while retreating, which created chaos in the stadium.

On the stage, Lin Yun and Yu Haotian ignored the crowd as they moved to opposite sides of the stage. Lin Yun was surprised by the power of the Heavenly Earth Overlord Art. If it wasn’t for that cultivation technique, he was confident he could have destroyed Yu Haotian’s attack. This was also the first time he felt such big pressure during the banquet. Not even his quasi-spiritual sword intent could give him an advantage. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“He’s at the very limits of the quasi-spiritual sword intent, he has the Azure Dragon Sword Aura, and his Overlord Sword is at the manifestation stage…” muttered Yu Haotian. The quasi-spiritual sword intent was truly terrifying and he understood why Zhao Wuji lost. Additionally, Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Aura was terrifying and became completely different after combining with the Overlord Sword. It made sense that Lin Yun’s Overlord Sword had reached the manifestation stage.

“Wow, you really are capable, but an ant is still an ant.” Yu Haotian’s processed his thoughts quickly and continued, “Allow me to apologize. I was only probing your strength. However, I don’t want to play with you anymore. Now, I want to stomp you to death.”

“I’m afraid that you’re overconfident.” The depth of Lin Yun’s eyes radiated with countless sword rays as he spoke.

“Is that so?” Yu Haotian snorted and unleashed a terrifying aura in the Heavenly Soul Realm. The pressure coming from him was unparalleled and made the crowd tremble in fear.

“Heavenly Soul Realm!”

“Yu Haotian is actually in the Heavenly Soul Realm. Isn’t this a little too much? He’s barely twenty-five years old!”

“No wonder he says that he can crush Lin Yun. He’s simply too terrifying.” First, Yu Haotian revealed his Heavenly Earth Overlord Art. Then, he revealed his true cultivation in the Heavenly Soul Realm. With these trump cards, Yu Haotian could easily suppress everyone in the banquet.

The gulf in their cultivation was too big. Yu Haotian was like a god compared to everyone who participated in the banquet.

Even the faces of the Sacred Alliance’s judges had changed. No wonder he dared to disregard the chief judge and act so arrogant. Yu Haotian was qualified to act how he wanted with his cultivation.

“Now do you know why you’re an ant in my eyes? You won’t even have the chance to surrender!” Yu Haotian’s aura was like a towering mountain.

Raising his head to look at Yu Haotian, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with indifference, “I already told you that you’re overthinking things. It’s still uncertain who’s the ant!”

When he finished speaking, a resounding sword hum echoed out in the horizon, which caused the entire heaven and earth to tremble. At the same time, Lin Yun’s terrifying sword aura soared into the sky. At this moment, he had completely transcended the xiantian sword intent. A level of sword intent that had never appeared before in the banquet was displaying its might. It was a sword intent that could make the entire Profound Amber Realm tremble.

At this moment, Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent reigned from above and shined brightly on the banquet.
