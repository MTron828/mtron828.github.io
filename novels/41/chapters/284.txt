Chapter 285 - Bet

What do you mean by ‘do your best?’ Gu Beixuan was unhappy with Lin Yun’s attitude. That was a half-hearted reply. The fight for the Imperial Sword Herb was intense and brutal.

Right at this moment, Lin Qiushan spoke out, “Brother Zhong, you can’t afford to be careless. The battle for the seven Imperial Sword Herbs is intense, so I hope that you can listen to my command during that time.”

They knew that Lin Yun was powerful, but his cultivation was only in the fourth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. So there was no way he could be more powerful than the both of them combined. If it wasn’t for the intense battle for the Imperial Sword Herb, they wouldn’t have allowed Lin Yun to join them.

“Listen to your command?” Lin Yun’s confusion could be seen beneath the mask.

“Brother Zhong, I forgot to tell you about this before coming. We’ve already decided beforehand to listen to Lady Lin’s command during the mission,” smiled Chen Ling.

“What’s the matter? Does it feel that bad to listen to my elder sister? My elder sister practices the strongest profound cultivation technique and her cultivation is in the pinnacle fifth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. Not to mention that she’s even ranked thirty-ninth on the Mortal Ranking. Even Senior Brother Gu doesn’t have any complaints about that. Yet, a random person like you is…” But before she could even finish her words, Lin Yun directed his cold gaze over that sent a chill down her spine and instantly shut her up. Lin Yan felt both enraged and ashamed. No one had ever treated her in this manner before.

“We’ll see when the time comes.” Lin Yun gave her a vague reply. He didn’t think that Lin Qiushan had the ability to command him. They were only in a cooperative relationship, not a superior-subordinate relationship.

“Brother Zhong is rather aloof. I hope that you can stick with that when the battle comes.” Lin Qiushan gave a deep glance at Lin Yun and waved her hand for everyone to continue their journey. Lin Yan glanced at Lin Yun with deep resentment before she left with suppressed anger.

“Impudent,” muttered Tian Fei before he timidly ran off to catch up to Lin Yan. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’m sorry about that, Brother Zhong.” Chen Ling apologized. Both Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan had no idea about Lin Yun’s strength, so they only felt that he was arrogant. But Chen Ling knew that Lin Yun was fully capable of rejecting Lin Qiushan.

“It’s fine as long as we can obtain the Imperial Sword Herb,” said Lin Yun. Lin Yun had no idea of the IMperial Sword Herb’s location and he also didn’t want to reveal his identity. Otherwise, Lin Yun would’ve gone by himself to obtain it.

Three days later, the intensity of the Alliance-Union Battle settled down. The stronger disciples had already obtained the qualification to enter the second round on the first day and most of those disciples who came trying to take advantage of the situation were eliminated.

There were no rules in the Alliance-Union Battle, so killing was allowed. So it was impossible for anyone to make it far without any strength. The remaining disciples weren’t weak and they were used to the Burial Sword Peak’s environment. It caused them to become more prudent. Because of that, the numbers of disciples being eliminated also began to decrease.

Although the forest seemed calm, the observation stage outside was in a commotion. Three days wasn’t long at all. After all, going into seclusion was a lot longer as the time would usually last thirty days.

Disciples were sparring on the observation stage while the elders played chess. The spiritual energy here was abundant and it wasn’t any inferior to a treasured land. Cultivating here was more efficient. However, judging from the rowdy atmosphere, no one was cultivating.

At the elders’ seats, where Luo Feng and Bai Ting sat as the leaders, a random Elder spoke out, “It has already been three days and I bet all participants know about the Imperial Sword Herb. I wonder who will obtain the first herb?”

“Isn’t it obvious? It’s clearly Chu Haoyu. He’s the first on the Mortal Ranking, so how could anyone possibly stop him?” replied Bai Ting.

“Don’t forget about Jiang Feng and Ye Xiu. They’ve hidden their strength well.”

“It’s uncertain. The Imperial Sword Herb is dangerous, so it’ll be an intense fight if those three meet up at the same Imperial Sword Herb.”

“How can there be such a coincidence? But I agree with Bai Ting’s view. The first Imperial Sword Herb will definitely go to Chu Haoyu.”

Luo Feng placed the teacup down. He smiled with narrowed eyes, “I don’t think so. Who knows, the first Imperial Sword Herb might be obtained by Lin Yun.”

“Lin Yun?” Bai Ting’s heart sank when he heard that name. The other elders also became silent. Everyone knew that Bai Ting had a bone to pick with Lin Yun after the latter slew Wang Ning back in the Nine-Stars Contest. Bai Ting was in deep trouble because of that and he was still furious about it right now.

“It will be impressive if he can even survive the first round. He has offended everyone on the top ten rankings, so how can he possibly survive through the first round? How can he snatch the Imperial Sword Herb if his life is in danger? Who knows, he might be hiding somewhere right now.” Bai Ting had an unfavorable impression of Lin Yun that was full of resentment and killing intent. He didn’t bother concealing it, even with so many elders present.

“Why don’t we make a bet then? Let’s bet with 1,000 second-grade spiritual jades. You’re going with Chu Haoyu, while I’m going with Lin Yun,” smiled Luo Feng.

“Sure. Add another 1,000 spiritual jades to the bet,” smiled Bai Ting. His smile was sinister and he was confident that Lin Yun wouldn’t dare to show up to snatch the Imperial Sword Herb.

“So be it,” laughed Luo Feng. He was also confident in Lin Yun. He knew that Lin Yun would go after the Imperial Sword Herb if he knew about the miraculous effects of it. Lin Yun was someone who even dared to snatch the five star A-ranked missions, not to mention an Imperial Sword Herb.

Very quickly, the bet between Bai Ting and Luo Feng spread out. After all, the first round wasn’t just about eliminating disciples, but also the fight over Imperial Sword Herbs. It was without a question that the designated locations for the Imperial Sword Herbs would be drenched in blood.

The Imperial Sword Herb was perfect to be used with the Swordcloud Core. It was a temptation that no elites could resist. The outer disciples on the observation platform began discussing excitedly and someone even went as far as opening a bet for it.

“Come and bet who’ll obtain the first Imperial Sword Herb!”

“Isn’t that obvious? It’s definitely Chu Haoyu. I’ll place my bet on him!”

“The rate is too little for Chu Haoyu and it’s meaningless to bet on him. I would rather bet on Jiang Feng and Ye Xiu.”

“Why don’t you say that the rates for other elites are higher?”

“Hehe, so what if the rates are high? Look at Lin Yun’s rate, it’s 1:10. But do you even dare to place your bet?”

“Who dares to bet? He hasn’t been seen for the past three days. The top ten on the Mortal Ranking are after him and they’ll probably abandon the Imperial Sword Herb to go after him if he dares to show up.”

The disciples of the Locket Mountain’s faces were unsightly. Mo Cheng cursed, “These people are too much! I’ll go and speak with them. Junior Brother Lin is still alive, yet they’re all cursing him.”

“It’s their mouths, so let them say whatever they want. Who’s the banker for the bet? Place 50,000 spiritual jades on my behalf,” smiled Xin Yan.

Mo Cheng’s face turned ugly. He then said with little confidence, “Senior Sister, is there a need for you to do that?”

“I’m confident in junior brother,” replied Xin Yan with a brilliant smile on her face.

In the end, Mo Cheng could only go and place the bet of 50,000 spiritual jades on Lin Yun helplessly. It was an astronomical sum, which startled everyone.

When the news of Xin Yan placing her bet on Lin Yun got out, Wang Yan swept his glance over and sneered, “You must be dreaming. Place a bet of 100,000 spiritual jades on Chu Haoyu. Make her lose everything!”

Xin Yan still probably had no idea that he had issued a bounty on Lin Yun. So how would Lin Yun dare to show himself with so many eyes after him?

In the Lone-Star Alliance, Feng Chuan asked, “Are we going to bet on Ye Xiu?”

“Bet on Chu Haoyu. Ye Xiu probably won’t reveal many of his trump cards in the first round. Let’s not waste Xin Yan’s effort for wanting to give us money,” smiled Feng Chuan.

Something similar was taking place among the other alliance-unions. Everyone’s attention on the Imperial Sword Herbs was unprecedented.

In the Burial Sword Peak, everyone gradually approached the respective designated locations for the Imperial Sword Herbs. Lin Qiushan’s party also started to face more difficult opponents. The difficulty really did increase as Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan had to start making their moves.

Just when they were about to approach one Imperial Sword Herb’s designated location, three figures appeared before them without a warning. The three figures swept a glance at the group before they swiftly left.

“It’s the Gentlemen Union again. They’re really annoying. They’re practically looking everywhere for Lin Yun.”

“But there doesn’t seem to be any results judging from their progress.”

“Lin Yun must be hiding since there hasn’t been any news on him despite the heavy reward. I bet he won’t show up in the first round.” Everyone from the Will-o'-Wisp Alliance and Flamemoon Alliance casually chatted among themselves.

Everyone knew about the bounty the Gentlemen Union issued on Lin Yun. Tian Fei peeked at Lin Yun with a cold light flickering across his eyes before he whispered to Lin Yan, “Lin Yan, what do you think about the possibility of this fellow being Lin Yun?”

“Him?” Lin Yan looked at Lin Yun with disdain before she burst into laughter, “You must have something wrong with your head. He’s a nobody, so how can he possibly be compared to Lin Yun? Lin Yun killed Wang Ning when he joined the sect and rang the Phoenix Plum in barely half a year. How can a monstrous genius like him be compared to this person over here?”

Her tone contained her revere for Lin Yun. Then again, it wasn’t surprising because of how quickly Lin Yun rose up in the outer sect. He first slew Wang Ning before killing Ye Liuyun with the Overlord Sword.

Two months ago, he even rang the Phoenix Plum and embarrassed everyone in the top ten on the Mortal Ranking. For such a talent like Lin Yun, there were people looking up to him despite not uttering a single word. Her voice was loud, unlike Tian Fei, and it was heard by everyone in the three alliance-unions.

In the next second, everyone turned their gazes to Tian Fei, looking at him as if he were an idiot. After all, how could Zhong Yunxiao possibly be Lin Yun? Zhong Yunxiao couldn’t even be compared to one-tenth of Lin Yun’s strength. This made Tian Fei feel embarrassed and he no longer dared to speak.

“The Imperial Sword Herb’s designated location is up ahead.” Lin Qiushan suddenly spoke out from the front and drew everyone’s attention over.
