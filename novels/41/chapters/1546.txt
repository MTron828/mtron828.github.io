Chapter 1547 - Tian Xuanzi!

Mu Xuankong was walking within the clouds while holding onto Qin Xiao’s head. He hadn’t go easy on Qin Xiao. Many spectators, including some Samsara Edict Realm experts, couldn’t understand the battle between saints. This was why Mu Xuankong slowed down his speed. He wanted to let everyone know that no one can humiliate or bully the Sword Sect!

Since Qin Xiao dared to order Jin Jue to assassinate Lin Yun, this was the same as slapping the Sword Sect’s face. So Mu Xuankong naturally had to take revenge. After all, he promised Lin Yun that he wouldn’t allow him to be bullied as long as the Sword Sect still existed.

He couldn’t be bothered with a battle between juniors, which was the same for the Radiant Sword Saint. But since they sent a Samsara Edict Realm expert to go after Lin Yun, Mu Xuankong naturally had to interfere. Since Jin Jue wasn’t around, he would take Qin Xiao’s life, instead.

“Patriarch!”

“W-What’s going on? T-That’s the patriarch’s head?!”

“No, this is impossible!” The myriads of the Nether Divinity Clan’s disciples were shocked when they saw the head that Mu Xuankong was carrying. Their bodies began to tremble, and they stuttered to the point that they couldn’t speak clearly. After all, it was Qin Xiao they were talking about.

Qin Xiao became a saint eight hundred years ago. He was famous in the Nether Divinity Clan and the Ancient Barren Domain, but today, he died in the hands of Mu Xuankong. This was why everyone felt this was too unreal.

Saints were practically legends, but a saint had died before their eyes. This was a significant blow to them, and they finally realized that even saints could be killed. The faces of many experienced Samsara Edict Realm experts sank while looking in the direction Mu Xuankong that left silently in.

It had been many years since there was a battle between saints within the Ancient Barren Domain, and they couldn’t remember the last time a saint was killed. There was no doubt that Qin Xiao’s death would shake the entire Ancient Barren Domain or even the Eastern Desolation.

“I’m afraid the Ancient Barren Domain will fall into chaos!” The competition between sects and clans was intense within the Ancient Barren Domain. But there hadn't been any chaos since the Radiant Sword Saint was around. After all, the Radiant Sword Saint’s existence alone was enough to bring peace to the Ancient Barren Domain, and no one dared to invade.

If the Radiant Sword Saint weren’t around, the Ancient Barren Domain would’ve long been in the hands of other holy lands. After all, the Ancient Barren Domain used to be one of the nine ancient domains.

But the Radiant Sword Saint was running out of lifespan, and everyone knew there was an undercurrent within the Ancient Barren Domain, despite looking peaceful. No one would doubt that the Ancient Barren Domain would fall into chaos, and there would be a huge cleanse in the forces once the Radiant Sword Saint passes away.

The current peace was because everyone was waiting to see if the Radiant Sword Saint could take the last step out. But no one expected a saint to be killed before the outcome of the Radiant Sword Saint.

It wouldn’t take long for the other powerful forces to receive the news of Qin Xiao’s death, including the other saint clans. The death of a saint would cause a huge uproar, and the reason why Mu Xuankong killed Qin Xiao would also spread out.

“Quick, return with the news!”

“I’m afraid that the peace will be destroyed now. The Nether Divinity Clan isn’t a pushover, and they have a close connection with the Divine Dragon Empire.”

“You overthink it. As long as Tian Xuanzi doesn’t make a move, the Nether Divinity Clan will have no choice but to suck it up.”

“Bring back the news that Mu Xuankong has grasped the Sword Domain! We also have to find out the reason why Mu Xuankong came!” The saints in the surroundings turned into streaks of light as they rushed back to their forces.

When the Azureflame Saint Lord waved his hand, the Glory Saint Artifact, previously used by Qin Xiao, fell into his hand. He fell into silence as he looked at the longspear; he still couldn’t believe that Qin Xiao had died just like that. In the end, Qin Xiao was too weak, and Mu Xuankong was too strong. Not to mention that Mu Xuankong’s Sword Domain was somewhat strange.

“Hmph. Qin Xiao really wasted the past eight hundred years. He can’t even grasp the Frostflame Dual Glory Spirits!” The Indigothunder Saint Lord coldly said.

The Azureflame Saint lord didn’t say a word. He felt that even if Qin Xiao could grasp it, it couldn’t change his outcome. At best, he would only last slightly longer against Mu Xuankong. As long as Mu Xuankong was determined to take Qin Xiao’s life, no one in the Ancient Barren Domain could save him unless Tian Xuanzi made a move.

But if Tian Xuanzi was willing to help, he would’ve appeared in the Nether Divinity Clan long ago with his strength.

“Qin Jue!” The Azureflame Saint Lord summoned the Grand Elder.

“Saint Lord!” Qin Jue uneasily looked at the Azureflame Saint Lord.

“Before the next patriarch is decided, you’ll be responsible for keeping this spear safe.” The Azureflame Saint Lord handed the Glory Saint Artifact over to Qin Jue. This meant that Qin Jue would have to clean up the mess.

Hearing what the Azureflame Saint Lord said, Qin Jue was briefly stunned before quickly receiving the longspear.

“Dismissed.” The Azureflame Saint Lord waved his hand just when Qin Jue wanted to say something.

“What should we do now? Are we going to let this matter rest so easily?” The Indigothunder Saint Lord’s face was ugly. After all, this was the first time he had been forced into such a pathetic state since he became a saint. If they couldn’t handle this matter well, there was no doubt it would be a disaster for the Nether Divinity Clan.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He had fallen into a dilemma and couldn’t make a decision. They would only be courting death if they headed to the Sword Sect. After all, Mu Xuankong could intimidate the two of them with a gaze. Even if they head back to the Nether Divinity Clan to bring reinforcements, there’s no way they could be compared to the Sword Sect.

“We definitely can’t let this matter rest so easily,” said the Azureflame Saint Lord. “I’ll head to the war realm and report this matter to the ancestor. You make a trip to the Profound Sky Sect and ask Tian Xuanzi for an explanation.”

“If that ingrate, Tian Xuanzi, was reliable, Qin Xiao wouldn’t have died!” The Indigothunder Saint Lord roared.

“I naturally know that, but we still have to make a trip. Forget it. I’ll go with you.” The Azureflame Saint Lord’s pupils flashed with a cold light. “Let’s go. We can’t let this matter go so easily, and the Sword Sect will have to pay the price, sooner or later!”

There was a valley covered with flowers within the Profound Sky Sect. This valley was called the Hundred Flowers Valley, where Tian Xuanzi stayed. This valley was filled with the fragrance of flowers. Each flower was exquisitely chosen, making this place look like a white celestial realm.

There was a spiritual lake and a pavilion at the valley's heart. The pavilion had a simple table, and there was a chessboard on the table.

Tian Xuanzi was donned in white with a golden flower on his right shoulder that matched his blonde hair well. This made his already feminine face even more feminine. The view of the valley, spiritual lake, and Tian Xuanzi all together looked like a natural and gorgeous painting.

Qin Cang was quietly standing in the pavilion. He didn’t dare to disrupt his master. He didn’t know if his master was playing chess with himself or with someone else through space. This was because his master was the happiest whenever he was playing chess.

His master would always lose by half a piece. But whenever it reached an exciting part, his master would smile from the bottom of his heart.

This time, his master lost again as a black chess piece fell onto the chessboard. Tian Xuanzi smiled, “I lost.”

No one replied to him. A smear of desolation flashed on Tian Xuanzi’s face after he smiled. He raised his head, looking in a direction with an expression that suggested that a gorgeous woman was standing there. The desolation soon disappeared on his face as he walked out of the pavilion, heading towards the valley with Qin Cang quickly following behind him.

When they entered the valley's depths, Tian Xuanzi plucked a piece of the petal from the flower on his shoulder, and the petal immediately released an unimaginable floral fragrance. Simultaneously, the petal was shrouded in a holy light, giving the petal the appearance that it was the most beautiful item in the world.

When the petal was about to land on the ground, Tian Xuanzi waved his hand, and the petal froze in mid-air. This scene would baffle anyone, but Qin Cang wasn’t surprised and had no changes on his face.

Not long later, a snow leopard cat hopped into the air, pouncing at the petal. Tian Xuanzi smiled as he waved his hand, making the snow leopard cat miss. The petal was like bait for the snow leopard cat. In the end, Tian Xuanzi spread his arms apart and the snow leopard cat fell into his embrace.

He held onto the petal with his fingers and briefly used it to toy with the cat before letting go of it, allowing the snow leopard cat to devour it. When the snow leopard cat chewed on the petal, it showed a satisfied expression.

This cat might seem lazy, but Qin Cang knew that this cat possessed the white dragon’s bloodline. It was an ominous beast in ancient times.

“Qin Cang, do you want to become the patriarch of the Nether Divinity Clan in the future?” Tian Xuanzi asked.

“I-I’ve never thought of it before.” Qin Cang replied after a brief shock.

“You’re not willing?” Tian Xuanzi smiled as he raised his head.

“I’m willing as long as Master wants me to become the patriarch.” Qin Cang replied.

Tian Xuanzi smiled and let go of the cat in his embrace, allowing the cat to disappear into the flowers.

“That fellow really didn’t put me in its eyes.” Tian Xuanzi smiled.

“I’ll go and capture it.” Qin Cang said, wanting to catch the cat.

“It’s alright. Tell me about your reason?” Tian Xuanzi asked. He could tell from Qin Cang’s tone that he wasn’t very willing to become the patriarch of the Nether Divinity Clan.

“I only wish to follow Master.” Qin Cang honestly replied. Becoming the patriarch of the Nether Divinity Clan might seem glorious, but it was nothing in his eyes.

“You should head back first. I have guests.” Tian Xuanzi smiled and added, “Qin Xiao is dead.”

Qin Cang was shocked when he heard that. He couldn’t believe what he had just heard because Qin Xiao became a saint eight hundred years ago, and he was the patriarch of the Nether Divinity Clan. But he couldn’t ask more about it because his master had told him to leave.

When he left the Hundred Flowers Valley, he ran into the Azureflame Saint Lord and Indigothunder Saint Lord. Their faces were cold when they saw him.

“Looks like Tian Xuanzi has a good dog.” The Indigothunder Saint Lord even insulted. He heard everything from Qin Jue and was unhappy with Qin Cang.

The corner of Qin Cang’s lip twitched, but he ignored what the Indigothunder Saint Lord said.
