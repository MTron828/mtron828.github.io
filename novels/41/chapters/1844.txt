Chapter 1845 - You Only Live Once!

After the four of them sat down, An Liuyan took out all the top-grade wine Lin Yun had collected earlier. Their trip had come to an end, so it was time for them to sort out their harvests.

Amongst all the wine, Lin Yun only took the Thundercloud Wine, Blue Luan Wine, Azure Lotus Wine, and the Millennium Flame. He had taken less than 20% of the wine in total. As for the remaining 80%, 50% would go to Gu Jun, 20% to An Liuyan, and 10% to Mei Zihua. An Liuyan initially didn’t want to take any, but Gu Jun and Mei Zihua insisted that she take 20%.

“Boss An, I have already taken 10%, so you have to take 20% no matter what.” Mei Zihua insisted.

Gu Jun also nodded his head and said, “Boss An, don’t refuse it. You have taken good care of me in the past, and you deserve the 20%.”

“I’ll accept them, then.” An Liuyan smiled and retrieved the 20% that belonged to her.

“Old man, are you happy now?” Lin Yun smiled. “You got 50% alone, and all of us combined might not be comparable to you.”

“You guys have harvested in the Black Tortoise Vault, while I got nothing. Not to mention I even got a drop of heart blood forcibly taken from me.” Gu Jun said in an aggrieved tone.

“The Demigod Wine should be able to help you recover.” Mei Zihua said.

“That’s for sure.” Gu Jun’s pale face became excited, and he continued, “With this Demigod Wine, I can become a quas-saint on the spot!”

Thinking about the Demigod Wine, everyone couldn’t help feeling excited. After all, the value of this Demigod Wine was a lot higher than the other wines.

Lin Yun briefly looked around before he turned to Gu Jun, “Old man, can this place undergo the tribulation?”

Lin Yun had an idea when he heard Gu Jun could become a Quasi-Saint on the spot. Since Gu Jun could make a breakthrough, why couldn’t he give the tenth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm a try? With the help of the Demigod Wine, Lin Yun was confident in reaching the limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm.

But hearing what Lin Yun said, Gu Jun and Mei Zihua’s faces changed. They simultaneously asked, “You want to try and reach the limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm?”

Lin Yun nodded his head without saying anything else. But his response made the two take in a cold breath with shock on their faces. The limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm only existed in legends, and only a monstrous genius standing at the top of the pyramid could give it a try.

Gu Jun briefly pondered, then replied, “That’s for sure. But have you considered it well? The Demigod Wine might be able to help in making a breakthrough, but can you bear the limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm? I heard that those transcendent monsters in the holy lands have Saint Realm elders guarding them when trying to reach the limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm, not to mention they needed various means for safety. Even so, it was extremely dangerous, and the success rate was very low.”

“That’s true, so you have to think this through, Brother Lin.” Mei Zihua nodded.

“I have already come so far. Since I have a chance in trying to reach the tenth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, I naturally won’t let it go. Old man, tell me where I can undergo my tribulation.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Are you sure about that? Why don’t we wait till we’re out of the Profound Thunder Saint Palace?”

“I have already made up my mind.”

“Alright, then.” Gu Jun no longer tried to persuade Lin Yun, and looked at the pool. “There should be a Thunder Secret Realm beneath this pool, so you can undergo your tribulation there. In ancient times, the disciples of the Thunder Black Tortoise’s lineage would undergo their tribulations here, since there were a lot of benefits.”

“Just how many things are you still hiding?” Lin Yun asked, looking at the pool.

“It’s useless, even though I have a lot of secrets. After this trip, the Black Thunder Saint Palace will probably disappear for good.” Gu Jun smiled.

“Why is that?” Lin Yun asked.

With a depressed expression, Gu Jun said, “This Black Thunder Saint Palace was supported by the Black Thunder Martial Emperor, so it should been destroyed in ancient times. Now that the Starry Sky Secret Realm has been opened, the Black Thunder Saint Canon will surely be taken by those two. Without the Black Thunder Saint Canon, the Black Thunder Martial Emperor will no longer need to support the palace. But it’s a pity that it fell into the hands of an outsider…”

Talking about it, Gu Hun took another mouthful of alcohol. He risked his life coming here because of the key Lin Yun had, and there was a high possibility of obtaining the Black Thunder Saint Canon. As a descendant of the Thunder Black Tortoise’s lineage, he naturally hoped to retrieve it.

“The descendants of the Thunder Black Tortoise’s lineage have already declined outside the Eastern Sea. I initially wanted to revitalize the Thunder Black Tortoise’s lineage with the Black Thunder Saint Canon…” Gu Jun sighed.

Seeing this, An Liuyan tried to comfort him, “Elder Gu, you don’t have to feel too sad about it. You might still have a chance in the future.”

“Thank you, Boss An. But it’s alright, and I didn’t hold any hopes in the first place since it has been so many years.” Gu Jun smiled.

“Perhaps there might still be a chance.” Lin Yun said all of a sudden after a long time.

“What do you mean?” Gu Jun asked with his eyes lighting up.

“Let’s talk about it later. I can’t be certain for now.” Lin Yun smiled. He didn’t know who the woman was, but he had a feeling the white-clothed man might have some connections with him. If the white-clothed man obtained the Black Thunder Saint Canon, there was a possibility he might share it with him.

“Speaking of which, what did you guys take from the vault?” Gu Jun changed the topic.

“I’m pretty lucky and obtained a saint pellet. This might only be a seventh-grade saint pellet, but it’s a long lost pellet. It’s a genuine ancient saint pellet.” Mei Zihua smiled.

“Young Master helped me to get this.” An Liuyan smiled while retrieving the Paragon Phoenix Fan.

“Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact!” Gu Jun and Mei Zihua exclaimed. The Paragon Phoenix Fan consisted of two fans, one with the fire phoenix engraved on it, and the other had a blue luan engraved. When activated, it would shine with red and blue radiance respectively.

When An Liuyan opened the two fans, the two fans began to revolve around her. As she reached out, she held onto a fan each.

Seeing this, Gu Jun and Mei Zihua couldn’t help feeling envious.

“This Paragon Phoenix Fan is a perfect match for Boss An. You have no idea how many holy land geniuses will be envious of you.” Gu Jun smiled, holding onto his chin.

“It’s perfect. This sort of artifact is too rare, and just one is precious enough, not to mention it comes as a pair.” Mei Zihua praised. Compared to An Liuyan’s Paragon Phoenix Fan, his ancient saint pellet was nothing in comparison.

“I got a string of Buddhist beads along with a few other miscellaneous treasures.” Lin Yun took out a string of Buddhist beads. The beads were forged with Indigo Divine Dragon Wood, and each bead had a bizarre rune on it. At the same time, one could hear mantras coming from the beads with lightning flickering on them. It was already emitting a ferocious and overbearing aura before Lin Yun even refined it.

“You’re really lucky.” Gu Jun said, examining the beads in Lin Yun’s hand. “This should be a powerful treasure of the Buddhist cult, the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads. If used well, it can summon the phenomenon of the Lesser Thunder Monastery. It can be used to suppress enemies with higher cultivation than you, and it’s especially effective against the fiend clans. Speaking of which, the value of this might even be higher than Boss An’s Paragon Phoenix Fan.”

“Really?” An Liuyan asked with her eyes shining brightly.

“Of course. This is a Buddhist cult’s treasure meant to kill. No ordinary Buddhist cult’s disciples can obtain it.” Gu Jun explained.

Turning to look at Lin Yun, An Liuyan rejoiced, “Young Master is really lucky.”

Lin Yun gave An Liuyan a smile. This was really a surprise. Now that he thought about it, he also had the Black Thunder Chains and Myriad Scales Armor in addition to these Buddhist beads. If he refined all of them, he would have four Glory Saint Artifacts, including the Flower Burial Sword. This meant he would be fully armed with Glory saint Artifacts, and just thinking about it alone was enough to make him feel excited. He couldn’t imagine how powerful he would become at that time, not to forget he still possessed the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

“Old man, can you really become a Quasi-Saint after drinking the Demigod Wine?” Lin Yun asked.

“What’s the matter? You don’t believe me? It’s even easier than reaching the tenth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.” Gu Jun said.

“Good. I have something for you, and I need you to help me remove the imprint on it after reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm.” Lin Yun said before retrieving the Myriad Scales Armor. He wanted to use this Glory Saint Artifact for a long time because he didn’t have any other treasures that could protect himself with.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Where did you get it from?” Gu Jun asked in a surprised tone.

“Why don’t you take a guess? I bet you can guess it.” Lin Yun smiled.

Gu Jun briefly pondered before he exclaimed, “The Wind Edge Lord!”

Lin Yun nodded his head as a form of acknowledgment.

“You’re really bold. But speaking of which, how did you manage to kill him when he’s wearing the Myriad Scales Armor?” Gu Jun asked. The Myriad Scales Armor was even stronger than the Nethermoon Saint Armor, and even someone at the pinnacle Profound Death Stage would have a hard time killing the Wind Edge Lord while being at the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

“Why don’t you take another guess?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Get lost!” Gu Jun furiosuly glared at Lin Yun.

“Haha, relax. I’ll have to trouble you with the Myriad Scales Armor, then.” Lin Yun smiled.

Mei Zihua was shocked while seeing this from the side. If he counted the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, he couldn’t imagine Lin Yun’s harvest.

“What do you plan to do with the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown? That will make you a public target. Since you can’t refine it, why don’t you let Saint Elder safeguard it for you?” Gu Jun asked.

“Let’s talk about that later.” Lin Yun smiled. He already thought of who to give the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown to. He wanted to give it to Su Ziyao the next time they met. He couldn’t find another person that fits the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown better than Su Ziyao, and her destiny should be able to wield the crown. If it was someone else, they might not be able to bear the weight of the sovereign destiny.

Lin Yun took out several exquisite cups and personally filled them with the Demigod Wine. The wine was gold colored, and it emitted a tempting fragrance that made everyone excited. They could practically foresee how strong they would become after refining the Demigod Wine. As for Lin Yun, he didn’t pour a cup for himself, but planned to refine it after entering the Thunder Secret Realm.

“You guys drink first and wait for my good news.” Lin Yun said, stowing the Demigod Wine.

Gu Jun stood up to see him off, and he even gave Lin Yun a pellet that could isolate the alcohol aroma before falling into hesitation.

“I’ll get going, then.” Lin Yun smiled, and walked towards the pool.

But just when he was about to get close to the pool, Gu Jun suddenly called out to him and gritted his teeth, “I’ll give you another drop of my heart’s blood. You can’t refine the Black Thunder Chain without the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood. Treat it as I owed you, so you better not be killed by the lightning!”

When Lin Yun turned around and received a drop of blood, he raised his head to see An Liuyan and Mei Zihua watching Gu Jun. For once, the old man was reliable.

“Don’t worry about it. I won’t die.” Lin Yun held onto the heart’s blood and said, turning to look at the pool. He knew that the three were worried for him. After all, anyone knew how dangerous it was to reach the limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm, and those who tried had someone protecting them.

But this was Lin Yun’s path as a swordsman, fearlessly walking forward without any hesitation. In a nutshell, you only live once!
