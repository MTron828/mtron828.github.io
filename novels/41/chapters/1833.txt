Chapter 1834 - Intense Battle Before The Palace

Anyone could hear the intimidation within Lin Yun’s tone, and he was clearly saying Kou Tianhua was their example if anyone wanted to come for his head. Ever since he stepped onto the Black Tortoise Void Sea, he was questioned by many people and they looked at him as if he was a walking treasure vault. It was as though they could claim his head to exchange for the precious Demonfeather Order.

Lin Yun was already long annoyed by that, and he knew he wouldn’t be able to intimidate anyone if he didn’t kill anyone. There was a reason why his gaze fell on Yu Wenxiu. It was because he could feel the ill intentions coming from these holy land geniuses.

Then again, they were all suppressed by him, so which of them didn’t want him dead here? Yu Wenxiu had a thick face, and he pretended not to see the hostility within Lin Yun’s pupils. He even nodded his head in Lin Yun’s direction with a smile.

“Young Master!” When Yuan Hengying and Lady Stone came to their senses, they were shocked as they looked at Kou Tianhua’s headless corpse.

“Lin Xiao, how dare you! That’s the disciple of the Whitebone Blade Saint!” Yuan Hengying coldly looked at Lin Yun.

The Whitebone Blade Saint was a famous expert in the Eastern Desolation’s demonic path. He was one of the Nine Black Mountain Saints, and he was known to be invincible beneath the Emepror Realm.

Everyone was also shocked by Kou Tianhua’s death, and the reason why they didn’t dare to provoke the latter was because of his master. Even if they fought with Kou Tianhua, no one would take his life and would only injure him to give the Whitebone Blade Saint face.

But the moment Yuan Hengying finished speaking, he was dragged over by a powerful force before a hand fell onto his head. The next moment, Yuan Hengying let out a scream as crimson demonic runes flowed out from his head.

The Fire God General was grabbing onto Yuan Hengying’s head with one hand, torturing him like a toy. He smiled, “Where did you get so much crap from? Only he’s allowed to kill Lin Xiao and not the other way around? Am I right, Lin Xiao?”

This sudden scene surprised everyone because Yuan Hengying was an expert at the fourth stage Profound Life Stage, and yet he couldn’t even put up a resistance against the Fire God General. As Yuan Hengying’s life force gradually disappeared, his body began to shrivel, which made everyone feel a chill run down their spines.

This instantly made everyone nervous, and they finally remembered the Fire God General was a lot more terrifying than Kou Tianhua. This also caught Lin Yun’s attention, and he already stuck the sign of a madman on the Fire God General. The Fire God General had no feud with Yuan Hengying, but he suddenly made a move and even wanted to torture him to death.

“That’s the truth of this world.” Lin Yun said, raising his head.

“Hehe.” The Fire God General smiled. “It seems like we’re the same kind of person. How about having a little fun with me? I heard my two brothers suffered in your hands, so I naturally have to do something as the big brother.”

As he crushed Yuan Hengying’s head, blood and brain juice splashed around, causing everyone’s faces to become pale. When Yuan Hengying died, the Fire God General suddenly charged over before Lin Yun could say anything.

Lin Yun swiftly responded by pouring the one hundred ten thousand dragon runes into his palm with the dragon origin in his violent palace boiling. When he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, a heavenly dragon and a divine phoenix appeared above his violet palace.

When they exchanged a move, they both took three steps back. The Fire God General instantly felt that it Lin Yun wasn’t just using the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. He should have practiced a dragon spirit cultivation technique that was comparable to the holy land disciples.

The Fire God General knew that if it was only the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, that attack of his should have been able to easily destroy most of the dragon runes.

“It looks like the disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain is truly extraordinary. I’m afraid that Kou Tianhua wouldn’t have been your opponent even if he drew his blade.” The Fire God General smiled. “But my Blood Moon Sect was invincible in the Kunlun Realm back then, and we’re not any weaker than the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain!”

As the Fire God General slowly raised his hands, his vitality began to erupt like a volcano. A crimson radiance also began to shine from him, and an ancient roar echoed from within his body. A terrifying demonic phoenix then appeared on him.

“The Demonic Phoenix Saint Physique!” Gu Jun exclaimed with his face changed.

Even the surrounding demonic cultivators and holy land geniuses had a drastic change on their faces. The Demonic Phoenix Saint Physique was an ancient body-refining technique that could transform the physique of a cultivator into a natural saint physique. It was one of the Blood Moon Sect’s ancient inheritances, but it was said that the Demonic Phoenix Saint Physique was long lost.

This was because it wasn’t only a body-refining technique, but it was rather comprehensive with movement, sword, palm, secret, and even forbidden techniques.

Manipulating the Demonic Phoenix Saint Physique, the Fire God General threw a punch forth with his right hand transforming into a demonic phoenix’s claw. When he threw his punch forth, a demonic melody began to echo from the Black Thunder Martial Emperor’s palm.

Countless demonic phoenixes flew out from the Fire God General’s body, and he was like the sovereign of all birds accepting the bow of his servants. The Fire God General instantly arrived before Lin Yun, and they both exchanged three attacks.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Three attacks later, Lin Yun took several steps back and was surprised because the attacks weren’t as strong as he had imagined. This was a bizarre feeling, and he could sense that the Demonic Phoenix Saint Physique was powerful, and that he shouldn’t be able to take it head-on. But after refining the saint-grade cores and the number of dragon runes broke through the restriction of a hundred thousand, his Azure Dragon Saint Physique seemed to have undergone a certain transformation.

“Not bad. You’re actually fine after taking three attacks from me.” The Fire God General’s pupils blazed with flames, and this piqued his interest because Lin Yun was worthy of being his opponent. It was just that Lin Yun’s cultivation was a little too low, and he couldn’t play too much.

“Demonic Phoenix Skyshattering Palm!” The demonic phoenix spread its wings behind the Fire God General, and his aura began to climb. With a wave of his hand, a palm descended from the sky. He wanted to suppress Lin Yun and make the latter acknowledge his defeat to take revenge for the embarrassment of Ao Feng and Yan Cangming.

“Azure Dragon Claw!” The Azure Dragon Sword Soul was summoned out from Lin Yun’s sword ocean, and he calmly faced the palm with the Azure Dragon Sword Art.

As the Azure Dragon Sword Soul merged with the golden-purple dragon runes, it manifested into a golden dragon claw as he drew the Flower Burial Sword from its sheath. As the azure dragon roared, thunderstorms began to envelop the claw, and it faced the Fire God General’s attack head-on.

When the two attacks collided, it looked like a battle between two ancient beasts, and the Fire God General was sent flying back under this attack. Although Lin Yun didn’t move, there were cracks spreading out from the ground beneath him, and the Space Saint Rune on the Black Thunder Martial Emperro’s palm was affected.

When the entire ground trembled, Lin Yun executed the Azure Dragon Tail without giving the Fire God General any time to think. The hundred-foot long sword aura he unleashed was like a dragon’s tail lashing out, causing space in its way to distort, and soon reached the Fire God General in the blink of an eye.

This made the Fire God General’s face change, and he swiftly threw a punch. When his punch collided with the sword ray, the sword ray shattered while the Fire God General took this opportunity to draw some distance.

When he landed on the ground, he slightly furrowed his brows because he was bleeding from his palm. Just a moment ago, he was nearly caught in the sword ray. It had been a long time since he felt something like this.

The fight between them might be intense, but everything happened in the blink of an eye as the surroundings fell dead silent. Everyone was shocked when they witnessed the Fire God General’s strength, and saw that Lin Yun was also strong.

The Fire God General was already famous before entering the Profound Life Stage, and yet Lin Yun didn’t fall into a disadvantageous position when he fought the Fire God General.

“Come again!” The Fire God General smiled, and he swiftly charged towards Lin Yun. Everything happened too quickly, and the Fire God General was more serious in the fight this time. This time, Lin Yun’s sword was knocked away before he could even perform any sword techniques.

“What…” Lin Yun was surprised.

“Don’t be too surprised. You only need one sword to kill Kou Tianhua, and I only need a palm if I want your life. I’m just playing with you, so don’t take it too seriously.” The Fire God General smiled with a demonic radiance gushing out of his pupils.

When the ancient demonic phoenix let out a cry, a dazzling crimson light shone from his body as the demonic phoenix’s aura swept out. Under his laughter, the Fire God General’s hands were like a pair of demonic phoenix wings that could cover the sky with a slight movement.

As he charged forth, each of his palms was targeted at Lin Yun’s vitals, and the power contained within them made everyone’s scalps go numb. In just ten moves, he already forced Lin Yun into a dangerous position. Ten moves later, they both exchanged a palm, and the Fire God General laughed, “Kneel!”

He released his aura at the Profound Life Stage and made everyone in the surroundings feel suffocating. But when their palms collided, it was the Fire God General that was knocked flying back as nine dragon pulses reaching twenty-three thousand feet each appeared behind Lin Yun. The dragon pulses covered the sky, and this left everyone dumbfounded.

“How is this possible?”

“Dragon pulses over twenty thousand feet… are you kidding me?”

“Isn’t this a little too exaggerated? His dragon pulses were only over ten thousand feet in the past. So how did they suddenly go to twenty thousand now?” The holy land geniuses were stumped, and couldn’t comprehend this.

“Sword!” Lin Yun roared, and the Flower Burial Sword flew over before thrusting towards the Fire God General at a tricky angle. This scared the Fire God General, and a few strands of his hair were sliced, even though he managed to dodge the attacks.

“Azure Dragon Claw!” Lin Yun remained in the same position, and he raised his right hand. The Flower Burial Sword reacted as if it was held by someone and performed the Azure Dragon Claw, manifesting into a dragon claw that pressed down.

After the Fire God General barely managed to avoid the attack, Lin Yun quickly followed behind with the Azure Dragon Tail, unleashing a dragon’s tail. The Flower Burial Sword was too close, and a hundred-foot long sword ray exploded. This caught the Fire God General by surprise, and he was enveloped by the sword ray. The hundred-foot long sword ray was like a dragon’s tail slamming into the Fire God General.

This made everyone’s faces change because everything happened too quickly, and no one could imagine this. But their shock only lasted for a brief moment before the Fire God General pushed his palms to the side and unleashed his cultivation, shattering the sword ray.
