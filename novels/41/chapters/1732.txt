Chapter 1733 – Beginning of the Banquet

The kiss lasted for a long time before they parted. Yue Weiwei smiled sweetly, “Big Brother Lin, it’s time for us to get going.”

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun smiled.

An hour later, the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s party gathered with Mu Xueling leading the party. The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion had seven quotas, and they were given to Lin Yun, Yan Tianchen, Yue Weiwei, Lin Wan, Zhang Mu, Zuo Hongyun, and Xiang Feiluan.

They might have a lot of quotas, but everyone knew that only Lin Yun, Yue Weiwei, and Yan Tianchen stood out amongst them. The others didn’t even grasp the Saint Tone, and it was already a problem for them to get through the first test.

When the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion set off, many people in the Heavenly Domain City rushed out of the city. On the sea a thousand miles away, there was a hovering island enveloped in spiritual light. It was the legendary Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion.

There was once a real star hovering above the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. But that star shattered in the battle of deities, scattering into various islands. But only the island where the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion was residing still hovered in the air.

No one knew where the island was located, and it would appear outside the Heavenly Domain City when the Nirvana Banquet arrived. Ordinary people couldn’t participate in the Nirvana Banquet but could observe as long as they went onto the island. Then again, it wasn’t easy to ascend the island because it was impossible if one wasn’t strong enough.

After the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s party left the Heavenly Domain City, they raised their heads and immediately discovered that island. The island was enveloped in aurora lights, and one could faintly see the majestic palaces on it emitting an ancient aura.

“This is the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion?” Lin Yun squinted his eyes and felt that it was really mysterious. Lin Yun still couldn’t confirm if the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion was related to the Azure Dragon’s lineage.

“This is the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion? I heard that this Nirvana Banquet is way bigger than in the past. There won’t be another banquet of this scale for at least eight hundred years.”

“Ten thousand people, it’s a little unbelievable.”

“I heard that the six holy lands will be sending out their geniuses, aiming to become first. The Four Musical Houses are under great pressure this time.”

“That’s hard to say. The Four Musical Houses have a deep foundation, so they should be able to obtain the top ten, at least.”

“That’s right, but should you neven include the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion?” Discussions could be heard from the surroundings. They were all from the Heavenly Domain City. There were also experts who came from elsewhere to attend the Nirvana Banquet.

As multiple figures soared to the sky, they rushed towards the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion. The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion didn’t stop anyone from ascending the island, and the majority spent a great deal of effort. The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s party followed along, and they could see the Nirvana Stage upon raising their heads. That was where the Nirvana Banquet was being held.

A figure descended from the sky, and this person was dashing. Many gazes fell onto that figure. He was the chief disciple of the Flying Snow Pavilion, and the Flying Snow Pavilion was the strongest of the Four Musical Houses. “That’s Bai Yunfei of the Flying Snow Pavilion!”

Before the Nirvana Banquet began, Bai Yunfei had high popularity. So he naturally became the center of attention when he appeared.

“The Seven Exquisite Palace’s musicians are also here.” Many people turned in another direction and saw a group of people coming over. There was one person amongst them that was like the moon among the stars. That person was the most talented disciple of the Seven Exquisite Palace, Di Qiu. It was rumored that he had just reached twenty and was already a Grand Musician. This was enough to prove that this person was talented.

“It’s Hua Hongyu!” Another exclamation resounded. This time, it was a gorgeous lady with a veil covering her face. But the veil couldn’t conceal how breathtaking she was, and she instantly attracted everyone’s attention upon her arrival.

She was Hua Hongyu of the Myriad Flowers Hall and was acknowledged as the most beautiful lady in Heavenly Domain City for a long time. In terms of popularity, she far exceeded Bai Yunfei and Di Qiu. After all, who wouldn’t like a beauty like her?

Yan Tianchen was quietly watching and didn’t stand out amongst the crowd. He might be the chief disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, but no one recognized him. This further meant that his popularity was pale in comparison to the geniuses of the three other musical houses.

On the other hand, Lin Yun attracted many people’s attention.

“That white-robed youth is Lin Xiao?”

“That’s him. I heard he defeated all the geniuses at the West Garden Banquet.”

“Are you serious?”

“Absolutely. The Wind Edge Lord suppressed this matter, so no one said anything to give him face. But a paper cannot contain the fire and it has long spread out.”

“How ruthless!” But they briefly glanced at him and didn’t pay any more attention. After all, not many people have witnessed Lin Yun’s strength. Thus, his popularity in the Nirvana Banquet wasn’t as high as the other popular candidates. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Lin Yun kept a low profile while cultivating in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion during this period. So when the West Garden Banquet’s event died down, the number of people discussing it gradually decreased. But they weren’t bothered and continued moving forward. It didn’t take long for them to reach the core region of the Nirvana Stage.

There were guards of the Heavenly Nirvana Banquet guarding the stage and upholding order. The Nirvana Stage had a long history. There were rumors that it was an ancient saint artifact, and it was heard that playing the musical instrument here could transmit to the nine heavens.

This was why everyone who came here obliged to the rules, and no one dared to cause chaos. This was the prestige that the Nirvana Banquet had accumulated over thousands of years.

Some tried to cause trouble in the past, but they died a terrible death. The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion also had a close relationship with the six holy lands, so no one in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea dared to provoke them.

At the top of the Nirvana Stage was a throne. The elders and geniuses of the holy lands were gathered around the throne, and the Four Musical Houses’ elders were also invited over. Close to the throne, there was a youth that stood out.

He glanced around, and his pupils radiated with an arrogance that made even those from the three musical houses respectful to him.

“Is that Li Yuxi of the Ming Cult?” Someone whispered. The Ming Cult was one of the six holy lands and was a top-tiered force since they could be called a holy land. They had an ancient inheritance, and they have existed since ancient times. To become a holy land, the force had to exist before the Dark Era and possess an unrivaled foundation.

Not only that, but they had to possess ancient saint veins, Sovereign Saint Artifacts, and inheritances that far exceeded the dragon spirit martial technique. Most importantly, they needed an Emperor Realm expert in the force.

The Sword Sect had fulfilled all the requirements except for an Emperor Realm expert. Otherwise, there would be seven holy lands in the Eastern Desolation now.

Li Yuxi was amongst the few with the highest popularity in this Nirvana Banquet, and he had one additional advantage compared to others. Not only did he grasp the Great Saint Tone, but he was also ranked in the top hundredth on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

The Dragon Pulse Ranking consisted of all Dragon Pulse Realm cultivators in the Eastern Desolation, regardless of age. Entering the top hundredth at such a young age was enough to prove his talent, and there were rumors that Li Yuxi had fused his martial dao and music dao together.

He might not be comparable to the Four Musical Houses’ geniuses in his music dao alone. Still, he had a decisive advantage after combining his martial dao with it.

“Yuxi, you’re a strong candidate, so don’t fall and become a joke to the other holy lands.” A Ming Cult’s senior smiled.

“I will definitely obtain first, and the Three-Lives Fruit will be mine!” Li Yuxi said.

The Ming Cult’s seniors nodded their heads when they heard that because Li Yuxi was strong. As more people came, the Nirvana Stage became even more bustling, and the surroundings were filled with people. The Nirvana Banquet was a grand occasion for musicians, and seventy percent of Kunlun Realm’s musicians would place their attention here.

When the sun rose from the east with sunlight shining down, a figure slowly walked towards the throne under the guards of the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion.

They instantly became the center of attention when they appeared. The one leading the party was a middle-aged man with an incredible breadth of mind. He was the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master. When he appeared, the elders on the guest seats all stood up in the form of respect.

When Lin Yun turned to look, he noticed that even the holy land’s elders stood up. Everyone, except for Mu Xueling.

Interesting… Lin Yun wore an indifferent smile.

“We pay our greetings to the pavilion master!” The guests cupped their hands together and bowed. For the holy lands’ elders to be so respectful, everyone had to admit that the pavilion master looked pretty almighty. The pavilion master looked to be in his forties. He couldn’t be considered handsome, but he had an elegant temperament that made everyone feel immense pressure, so no one dared to look at him for long.

“The Nirvana Banquet will begin today, and I’m only a host. All of you are musicians who came from various parts of the world, so there’s no need to pay much attention to me.” The pavilion master smiled.

“Pavilion Master, you’re being too humble.” The guests waited for him to sit before they sat down.

“The Nirvana Banquet has nurtured geniuses in music dao, and most young musicians are here. I hope everyone can shine brightly on this platform, and it’s fine even if you lose. If you catch my attention, you can still enter the Nirvana Treasury, and I won’t be a miser.” The pavilion master said. “But I know many musicians also practice martial dao simultaneously or mainly focus on martial cultivation. But this is an event for musicians, so I won’t give you any face if you take advantage of your martial cultivation, even if you’re a holy land’s genius.”

His voice was calm but unquestionable. The reward of this banquet was shocking, and there was bound to be martial cultivators who were tempted. Some might use their martial cultivation, especially geniuses of the holy land. If they fought with their lives on the line, not many people could defeat them.

The pavilion master’s words calmed everyone down. A Ming Cult’s elder asked, “Is it against the rules to fuse martial dao and music dao?”

“Naturally not.” The pavilion master smiled as he turned to look at Li Yuxi. “I heard that this young lad here cultivates the ice and fire intents simultaneously, and that you can completely fuse them into your music dao. I hope that you will surprise me.”

“Pavilion Master, you’re being too serious. This is just a small trick.” Li Yuxi smiled. His words were humble, but everyone could sense his pride.
