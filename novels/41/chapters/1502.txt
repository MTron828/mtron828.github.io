Chapter 1503 - Fighting Xie Feng

The umbrella began to crackle with lightning when Lin Yun poured his dragon runes into it. As a dragon roar echoed, it sounded majestic, and Ku Ying, who wanted to seize the umbrella away from him, was immediately sent flying away.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Glory saint artifact?” Xie Feng’s eyes lit up when he saw the umbrella, and he couldn’t contain his excitement.

“Hahaha. You’re Lin Tian, right? You really have quite a lot of treasures. If I remember correctly, you have a metallic wooden sword. You’re really bringing me luck! All of you back down. I’ll deal with this brat!” Xie Feng said, and he even glared at Ku Ying.

This made Ku Ying’s gaze start changing. He was naturally a lot stronger than Xie Feng, and he could just leave if they were outside. But they were in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, and he couldn’t afford to offend the Netherworld Hall. After all, there were a lot of powerhouses outside the astral realm.

“Ku Ying, keep watch, and don’t let that brat escape!” Xie Feng instructed.

Ku Ying was reluctant, but he still smiled, “Don’t worry about it. That brat won’t be able to escape today!”

“Empress, how’s the preparation?” Lin Yun was able to suppress everyone for the time being, but he still couldn’t face so many people alone. Looking at Ku Ying and Xie Feng’s confidence, the two definitely had a lot of treasures.

In the end, his cultivation was too low. He was already struggling against an eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, not to mention that there was a nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm around. He knew that it wasn’t enough with the umbrella. Most importantly, he couldn’t bring one one-thousandth of the umbrella’s power.

He had to open it if he wanted to barely wield this umbrella, which was why Xie Feng and Ku Ying were so confident about taking him down.

“A little longer.” The empress said, and this made Lin Yun feel relieved. This meant that he wouldn’t be forced into a dead-end here.

Xie Feng looked at Lin Yun and rolled his eyes with a smile. “Brother Lin, it’s true that we don’t have any previous conflict of interest, and I’m mainly targeting An Liuyan. You’re a mere guest, not to mention that there’s no need for you to stick with the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. The Heavenly Astral Pavilion is the weakest amongst the seven demonic sects. Isn’t it better to join the Netherworld Hall?”

Lin Yun was calm as he shook his head. There was no way he could join the Netherworld Hall. Not to mention that he killed Lan Siyu, and his cooperation with An Liuyan came first. Moreover, no matter how he looked at it, An Liuyan was more suitable as a friend than Xie Feng.

“Why?” Xie Feng squinted his eyes and calmly smiled, “There’s no need to lose your life for a woman, right? It isn’t easy to win over someone like An Liuyan, and you’re probably a chess piece for her. Give me the umbrella, and I can let you have your fun when I capture her!”

“I don’t need you to guess my thoughts.” Lin Yun calmly replied.

Xie Feng’s face sank when he heard Lin Yun’s words, and he coldly said, “You must be courting death, then. Do you think you’re invincible because of an umbrella? I’ll let you experience…”

With a grasp, a saint artifact appeared in his hand. This was a long spear, and the spear emitted a crimson glow when he held it; this was a myriad rune saint artifact!

“The name of this spear is Star Devourer, an inherited saint artifact of my Netherworld Hall. Today, I’ll let you know the meaning of true strength!” Xie Feng sneered, unleashing a terrifying pressure when he held onto the spear.

As crimson light shrouded the spear tip, the spear gave off a feeling that it could shatter the sun. Along with a boundless demonic aura, Xie Feng charged forth with the spear. He had activated most of the saint runes, and the saint aura had reached a terrifying height. All of the crimson glow was gathered on the spear, tearing the dragon aura from the umbrella apart in its path.

“It’s a waste of a treasure for you to have the umbrella!” Xie Feng’s eyes flashed with disdain. He had seen too many people who possessed powerful treasures without sufficient strength and couldn’t even bring out the full power of the treasure.

Xie Feng's eyes flashed with disdain when he saw the dragon aura being easily torn apart. So what if it was a glory saint artifact? If he could bring out most of the myriad rune saint artifact, it would be easy for him to suppress Lin Yun.

The two quickly fought, and Xie Feng fully unleashed his aura at the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm after he brought out his saint artifact. Lin Yun’s face was calm, and he didn’t panic. He inwardly counted the time to estimate how far Xiao Yun and An Liuyan had fled.

“Devour!” Ten moves later, Xie Feng finally lost his patience. A crimson vortex appeared on the speartip, and the entire spear had turned into a primordial beast, and the whirlpool was the jaw. When the bloody jaw opened, the umbrella's thunderstorm phenomenon was devoured, instantly decreasing Lin Yun’s dragon aura.

But fortunately, he still had his firmament sword intent. Otherwise, the gap of three stars would expand, and Xie Feng would be able to easily kill him in the blink of an eye.

“Haha!” Xie Feng suddenly laughed. The crimson and silver wings behind him folded before opening like two crimson blades and hacked forth. This caught Lin Yun by surprise.

Lin Yun could feel a threat coming from the crimson wings. He had poured all his dragon runes into the umbrella, and there was no way he could withstand the power of the crimson wings with his physique. If he had a Divine Dragon Bone, he could keep producing dragon runes like astral energy.

Usually, it was fine, but his flaw expanded when facing a real enemy. Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to summon the Golden Crow Wings, and the two wing sets collided like saws with sparks flying around. When the two pairs of wings collided, the collision sounded metallic, and Lin Yun’s Golden Crow Wings slowly began to crumble.

This made Lin Yun’s face change, pushing the Divine Sunchasing Art to the limit, leaving behind afterimages in the air. But Xie Feng was too fast. When the Golden Crow Wings crumbled, Xie Feng’s wings quickly slashed. Lin Yun suffered a gash on his chest even after he had pushed his movement technique to the limit. His physique was also broken through, and blood flowed out from his wound.

“This pair of wings were forged with agrium metal. How are you going to compete with me?” Xie Feng roared, thrusting the Star Devourer Spear like a meteorite. This spear made a huge impact, making the surroundings fall into darkness as a star expanded before Lin Yun’s eyes.

“Alright, it’s all prepared!” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded right at this moment.

As a cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, he activated the Blood Flame Divine Rune and poured the crimson flames into the umbrella. The saint runes lit up on the umbrella, and Lin Yun could feel that the umbrella had come to life.

But this umbrella also became incredibly heavy, as if it wasn’t an umbrella but an entire mountain. Lin Yun’s forehead was covered in sweat, and he gave up trying to open it and chose to swing it, instead.

The umbrella's total weight was activated as Lin Yun swung the umbrella. The umbrella and spear collided, causing a massive explosion, and the crimson light that enveloped the spear gradually dissipated.

The impact made Xie Feng throw out a mouthful of blood before he flew back. His arms became numb from the impact, and it felt like his bones were about to break.

But Lin Yun didn’t let him go so easily and stepped forth, swinging the umbrella again. Under tremendous pressure, Xie Feng quickly raised his spear to defend against this attack. When the umbrella and spear collided once more, Xie Feng threw out another mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away.

“Senior Brother!” The other guests of the Netherworld Hall’s faces changed as they stepped forth, wanting to aid Xie Feng against Lin Yun.

“Stop!” Xie Feng roared. These people didn’t have a myriad rune saint artifact, and Xie Feng couldn’t think of the consequences if they faced the umbrella. But it was too late. Lin Yun swung the umbrella out.

The four people that charged forth took an attack head-on, and their bodies were torn apart. This scene was too brutal, making Xie Feng’s face turn white before throwing another mouthful of blood.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun let out a breath of relief as he retreated. But when he fled, Ku Ying’s voice resounded within the palace, “Don’t worry about it, young master. I’ll capture him!”

Ku Ying grinned with his eyes filled with greed while he quickly chased after Lin Yun. This made Xie Feng’s face change as he struggled back onto his feet before he roared, “After him!”

Like that, he quickly followed behind the remaining two people because he knew that Ku Ying had other thoughts.
