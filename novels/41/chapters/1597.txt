Chapter 1598 - Heavenly Barren City

As the drums became increasingly louder, everyone’s expressions became grave while watching Mu Xuankong. Their expressions were solemn, and there was even a hint of sorrow. Lin Yun could tell that the sect master was cheering for everyone and reminiscing about the Golden Generation who died two decades ago. All his emotions were accumulated in his heart, and he wanted to vent it all out.

Half an hour later, the drums stopped and Mu Xuankong was hovering in the air, looking at everyone. His expression became gentle, and he said, “You are all disciples of the Sword Sect, and I don’t have to say how dangerous the Ancient Barren Battlefield is. The Ancient Barren Battlefield is brutal, and we have always been united. But you guys must be even more united.

“I don’t wish to talk too much, and I don’t have any requests. It’s good enough if you guys can come back alive. Remember, no treasure is more important than your life!” Mu Xuankong’s voice was heavy. He could see their expressions of suppressed emotions and excitement, and Mu Xuankong naturally knew what they were thinking. He also knew that no matter what he said, it was destined that many people would die on the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

“Gu Ruochen!” Mu Xuankong turned to look at the chief disciple of the Scarlet Firmament Peak.

“Here!”

“As the Scarlet Firmament Peak’s chief disciple, you have to remember that the lives of my Sword Sect’s disciples are always first!” Mu Xuankong said.

“I understand!” Gu Ruochen said with a solemn expression.

“Lin Yun!” Mu Xuankong’s voice resounded again. Lin Yun was stunned because he never thought that Mu Xuankong would publicly call his name.

“As the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, you’re not allowed to embarrass the name of my Sword Sect!”

“I understand.”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“No matter what, remember that your life is more important than anything else to the Sword Sect! Don’t be impulsive, but you don’t have to hold back if you’re bullied. The Sword Sect doesn’t provoke trouble, but we’re also not afraid of trouble!” Mu Xuankong said.

Lin Yun was stumped upon hearing that, but soon understood that Mu Xuankong had permitted him to do whatever he wanted, no matter what happened in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. The Sword Sect would be his strongest backing if everything was within the rules.

“Sect Master, don’t worry about it!” Lin Yun raised his voice. “I have received much grace from my master and the sect master, and I will surely show everyone the might of my Sword Sect!”

Regardless if it was for his master or the Sword Sect, he would do his best in this Ancient Barren Battlefield.

“I will do my best to show everyone the might of my Sword Sect!” Lin Yun said, and his words made flames blaze in the pupils of the other disciples. Simultaneously, they showed no signs of cowering in their pupils.

“Where are the five peak masters?” Mu Xuankong asked.

“We’re here!” The Sword Sect’s five peaks masters appeared and gave Mu Xuankong a bow in mid-air. The Scarlet Firmament Peak’s peak master was Mu Xuankong, and the vice-peak master would go on his behalf because he had to stay in the Sword Sect.

“You guys will lead the party to the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Remember to ensure the safety of my Sword Sect’s disciples!”

“Please be reassured, Senior Brother.” Mu Chuan cupped his hands.

“Go on.” When Mu Xuankong finished, all the disciples flew and gathered behind the five peak masters. After everyone left, countless people flew out from the various peaks. They were all at the Elysium Core Realm, and some were deacons. They watched the party leave with Mu Xuankong.

Mu Xuankong’s gaze was complicated because he would rather not send them to the Ancient Barren Battlefield if he had a choice. But he didn’t have a choice because they had to compete in it. The treasures and opportunities hidden in the Ancient Barren Battlefield were something that every Dragon Pulse Realm disciple yearned for.

This battle concerned the glory of their sect and their disciples. But he had yet to learn how it would develop.

“We’ll head to the Heavenly Barren City. This is the closest city to the Ancient Barren Battlefield, where the various sects will gather. Some sects have probably arrived ahead of us, so we can meet at that time.” The party flew in the air as Mu Xueqin whispered to Lin Yun.

“How many people will there be from each sect?” Lin Yun asked. He roughly estimated that the Sword Sect sent out approximately four hundred Dragon Pulse Realm disciples.

“This isn’t the same.” Mu Xueqin explained. “According to everyone’s agreement, anyone under the age of thirty can enter, but the strength varies between sects. The Profound Sky Sect probably has the most people.”

“How many?”

“About seven hundred?” Mu Xueqin replied.

Lin Yun nodded upon hearing it, but this number was a little too unbelievable. From this alone, anyone could tell that the Profound Sky Sect was more potent than the Sword Sect in strength. Then again, that also proved that the Sword Sect had a terrifying foundation.

The Sword Sect lost their Golden Generation two decades ago, but they could still send so many people out, and this was enough to prove that the Profound Sky Sect hadn’t completely shaken them off. They could still put up a fight.

“Aside from powerful sects, the other clans and forces will be participating in this. It is so much so that some forces from other domains are allowed into the Ancient Barren Battlefield. All the Golden Generations amongst the Ancient Barren Domain’s younger generations will be here. The demonic forces will also join in, making the situation messier!” Mu Xueqin explained, to which Lin Yun nodded.

He wasn’t surprised because there were many opportunities in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and the attraction was fatal to any genius. People’s greed was endless, even if it was dangerous. So there was no question that this Ancient Barren Battlefield would be a gathering of geniuses.

Raising his head, a cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils. With his current strength, he could be considered to be amongst the strongest batch in the Ancient Barren Domain. He wouldn’t be afraid even if he had to face the Profound Sky Sect’s top three. All his trump cards and bitter cultivation over the past two years gave him confidence.

Calculating the time, it had been three years since he arrived in the Kunlun Realm. The other Heavenly Path’s champions were already on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, making a name for themselves. The Ancient Barren Battlefield might be dangerous, but it was also an unprecedented opportunity for him. If he couldn’t make it out alive and step on all the Ancient Barren Domain’s younger generations, he wouldn’t have the face to look for Su Ziyao in the Divine Dragon Empire.

The Ancient Barren Battlefield was situated between the north border and the Ancient Barren Domain. That region was famous in the Eastern Desolation because it was a legendary battlefield among deities in the Golden Era. Back then, this place was the Dragon Gate’s holy land.

Many experts gathered there to face the invaders, an unprecedented battle between deities. Countless experts and fiends lost their lives there. Aside from the Ancient Barren Battlefield, many ruins were of smaller scales, and those ruins had an endless flow of people.

Even if they couldn’t enter the Ancient Barren Battlefield, countless people were still coming here, and Heavenly Barren City was the biggest city there. While the Sword Sect was gathering, numerous people were streaking across the horizon. After all, this was a grand occasion that happened once every two decades, and they were also there for the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

“So many people!” Lin Yun was surprised because there were too many people. Not even the Heavenly Path and Dragon Remnant Astral Realm’s scale could be compared to this.

“Let’s go down. We will have to stay in Heavenly Barren City for some time until the Ancient Barren Battlefield opens up. That place is chaotic, and there are many demonic cultivators there. So you guys have to be careful.” The Scarlet Firmament Peak’s vice-peak master, Chen Lei, warned everyone. As the vice-sect master of the Scarlet Firmament Peak, he was equivalent to the vice-sect master of the Sword Sect, and his position was higher than the other peaks’ vice-peak masters.

“Let’s go!” Chen Lei swept his gaze around and led everyone into Heavenly Barren City. Their party was massive. Even if they had retracted their auras, they still drew the attention of many people.

“So many sword cultivators!”

“They’re the Sword Sect’s disciples. It’s no wonder why their sword intent is so powerful.”

“I thought the Sword Sect has declined? Why do they still have such a powerful formation? Four hundred people, they’re not any weaker than the other powerful sects.”

“They’re still the Sword Sect, even if they have declined. The Radiant Sword Saint is still alive, not to mention Mu Xuankong slew the Nether Divinity Clan’s patriarch. Tian Xuanzi didn’t stand out then, and this is enough to prove that the Sword Sect is still standing strong.”

“Ha, so what? The Radiant Sword Saint is strong, but he can’t enter the Ancient Barren Battlefield. The Sword Sect has been relying on the Radiant Sword Saint for all these years, but this is a competition between disciples!”

“They lost their Golden Generation two decades ago, and there’s already a gap between the two sects.”

“Yeah. Tian Xuanzi personally teaches the top three on the Profound Sky Sect’s Inner Ranking.”

The Sword Sect’s party arrival caused a massive commotion in Heavenly Barren City. Everyone knew about the grudges between the Profound Sky Sect and Sword Sect. So their appearance naturally drew various discussions.

Everyone in the Ancient Barren Domain knew about Tian Xuanzi’s ambitions. Tian Xuanzi also didn’t bother hiding his ambition based on the chant that the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples had been calling, and the surrounding discussions also made the faces of the Sword Sect’s disciples ugly.

“Since when is my Sword Sect weaker than the Profound Sky Sect? These people are blind, and we’ll make the Profound Sky Sect pay the price!” A disciple with a fiery temper cussed. The Ancient Barren Battlefield hadn’t started, and they were already being cursed at by those who believe that they would end up even worse than two decades ago.

Lin Yun’s face was also dark. The grudges built between the two sects were heavy, and they would probably start a war if they ran into the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples in the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

“Watch your words.” Gu Ruochen turned back to look at the disciple.

Right then, a group of people descended from the sky. They were all enveloped in a violent blade aura.

“They’re from the Heavenly Blade Pavilion.” Lin Yun had interacted with the Heavenly Blade Pavilion, and he instantly recognized their origin.
