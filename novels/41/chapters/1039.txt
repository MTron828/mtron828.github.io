Chapter 1040 - Never!

Moonlight shined down on the roof, which cast a silver sheen. The moon in the Heavenly Path was massive and looked close enough to touch. Lin Yun sat on the roof and stared at the moon blankly.

He was replaying the words of the general from the Imperial Diagram War Realm. The Realm Sons were extraordinary talents who laid a trap for him in Wind Mound City. He knew that they wouldn’t make the same mistake as they did in Yellow Sandy Plain.

The Realm Sons were strong and Lin Yun wasn’t confident that he could face all of them at the same time. But he knew that he had to go to Wind Mound City.

His journey ahead was difficult. The Realm Sons were strong, so he had a long way to catch up to them. As he recalled the past, the moonlight made his face look gentle. Memories of the Azure Sky Sect flooded his mind.

Then, memories of Yue Weiwei appeared in his mind as a smile plastered his face. In the blink of an eye, the scenes changed to the Sword Firmament Pavilion, where his name spread throughout the Great Qin Empire.

Suddenly, a scene appeared of someone lying on Xin Yan’s lap with a crimson dot on his forehead. Lin Yun clutched his chest as he reached out, trying to touch the scenes. The memory suddenly faded away as Lin Yun yelled, “Big Brother Xin Jue!”

He reached out, but he wasn’t able to grab onto anything, making him and the moon look desolate. With his fist clenched, Lin Yun began to tremble as a sinister expression filled his face. Xin Jue’s death was a wound to his heart. Even now, he still wasn’t over Xin Jue’s death.

Would Yue Weiwei follow Xin Jue’s footsteps? Never! Yue Weiwei was someone that he cared about, not to mention that Yue Weiwei had given him a lot of help. Plus, they shared life and death experiences.

There was also the matter of his promise that her enemies would become his enemies. Lin Yun gradually calmed down and his gaze became unprecedentedly firm. In the past, he only aimed to have no regrets. But this time, he was determined to use everything he had to save Yue Weiwei. He wouldn’t allow Yue Weiwei to die like Xin Jue had.

Right at this moment, a feeble voice sounded out. When Lin Yun turned his head, he saw Lil’ Red slowly walking over. When it came to Lin Yun, it raised its head and looked at Lin Yun gently before pushing its fist at him.

Lin Yun had no idea why Lil’ Red did that, but he also reached out with his hand. Lil’ Red must’ve sensed the fluctuation in his emotions. Lil’ Red was trying to remind Lin Yun that he was never alone.

Recalling the experiences he had gone through with Lil’ Red, Lin Yun realized that Lil’ Red had always been by his side. Although Lil’ Red couldn’t speak, the fist that reached out to Lin Yun was worth more than a thousand words.

Lin Yun began to tear up as he bumped fists with Lil’ Red. Then, Lin Yun and Lil’ Red both smiled.

“With us two brothers around, we will surely save Yue Weiwei!”At this moment, Lin Yun and Lil’ Red’s eyes were full of determination.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun smiled, while Lil’ Red landed on Lin Yun’s shoulder to jump off the roof.

“We need to use everything.” Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Red. “Take everything out, don’t keep anything hidden.”

Although Lil’ Red nodded its head, its eyes flashed with heartache because it had spent so much time collecting all sorts of treasures. It even stole treasures right in front of three Realm Sons. But it also knew that there was no need to continue to keep the treasures hidden.

When Lin Yun saw the three interspatial pouches, he suddenly became suspicious. It wasn’t like Lil’ Red to only have three interspatial pouches. He casually took one interspatial pouch and poured everything out.

In the next second, a mountain of Divine Astral Pellets appeared before him, dying the entire heaven and earth with a myriad of colors. Lin Yun was dumfounded because there were at least 50,000 Divine Astral Pellets.

“Holy shit, how did you manage to collect so much?” Lin Yun’s heart throbbed at this sight. Lil’ Red grinned as it made a gesture with its paws. Apparently, Lil’ Red took everything that the twelve generals had. It also took everything from the ruins and interspatial pouches that Lin Yun wasn’t interested in.

Lil’ Red looked at Lin Yun with its head raised high as if it was expressing to Lin Yun that it was capable.

“Wow, but they’re all mine now.” Lin Yun smiled and took the Divine Astral Pellets. Lil’ Red instantly made a bitter expression at Lin Yun.

“You can’t do that. After all, we bumped fists just a moment ago,” said Lin Yun as he took the pellets.

“Alright.” Lin Yun rubbed Lil’ Red’s forehead and opened the second interspatial pouch. The second interspatial pouch was also full of surprises. There was a pile of herbs and fruits that were at least a thousand years old. Many of them were so precious that even Lin Yun couldn’t recognize them. Aside from those treasures, the rest were pellets. He could tell that all three interspatial pouches were the best of Lil’ Red’s collection and the value of every single one wasn’t any weaker than saint pellets.

“This is a Blood Flame Pellet. It’s a saint pellet that can replenish one’s vitality. Although it’s not very precious, it’s extremely useful to me since I ran out of the Millennium Flame. This is the Pure Yang Pellet, the Jade Water Pellet, Cloud Wind Pellet… this is…” Lin Yun had practiced spiritual runes in the past and had seen many of these pellets from the records. However, there was one bottle that left him baffled. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It was a purple crystal bottle with silver liquid inside that emitted a dazzling brilliance. When it appeared in Lin Yun’s palm, he could sense the Azure Dragon True Bone becoming agitated.

“What is this?” Lin Yun’s heart began to throb violently because this was the first time he had seen the Azure Dragon True Bone responding in this manner. He then turned to ask Lil’ Red, but even Lil’ Red had no idea what it was because it had obtained the bottle from an inheritance. The jade bottle was placed near a pile of corpses that emitted a wisp of dragon aura.

“True Dragon Saint Liquid!” Lin Yun suddenly thought of something. It was a precious resource formed by refining the true dragon’s bloodline. Then again, there weren’t any more true dragons in the world and only demonic beasts that contained traces of the true dragon bloodline.

They were extremely precious and troublesome to refine. However, it was a pity that there was only one drop of it. Holding onto the bottle, Lin Yun’s eyes began to light up because he might be able to make great progress in the Azure Dragon Saint Art if he had a few more drops. He would be able to unlock the treasure in the Azure Dragon True Bone if he had enough.

“Fortunately, this is the Heavenly Path and there are many ancient inheritances here. There’s also the market in Four Phase City, so I might be able to get more.” Thinking about it, Lin Yun blazed with confidence. In the end, Lin Yun only took the True Dragon Saint Liquid and Blood Flame Pellets from the pile of treasures. He didn’t need the others for now.

This made Lil’ Red happy as it happily stored the rest of the treasures in its interspatial pouch. When Lin Yun opened the third interspatial pouch, he saw secret artifacts and dao artifacts. There were simply too many of them, which amazed Lin Yun. He had no idea how Lil' Red collected so many treasures.

“This is!” But soon, Lin Yun’s gazes fell onto three treasures. They were the three treasures belonging to the Realm Sons. He never would have thought that they were obtained by Lil’ Red. He knew that the Realm Sons would be crying if they knew about this.

When Lin Yun examined them, his eyes began to flicker. After all, they were powerful treasures. If the head generals were strong enough, they could have killed Lin Yun with these treasures. But it was a pity that he already had the Divine Shadow Glove and Indigoflame Thunderwhip.

Suddenly, Lin Yun looked at the tablet because he could sense a bizarre aura coming from it. It appeared that there were some secrets in the tablet. “Hmmm?”
