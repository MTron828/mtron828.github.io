Chapter 999 - He’s Here!

“What a monster… it seems like the Azure Dragon’s Tail inheritance can’t be underestimated…”

“He hid himself too deeply. It’s really terrifying to be enemies with such a powerful enemy.” All the spectators were shocked by Yu Haotian’s strength.

In mid-air, Luo Chen and Qin Lin threw up blood as the origin energy that protected them started to dissipate.

“Divine Glorymoon Fist — Three Seals Combined!” Yu Haotian laughed as three seals appeared above the silver winged human behind him. It was a similar secret technique comparable to Lin Yun’s Divine Glorysun Fist.

Sensing the aura coming from Yu Haotian, Luo Chen and Qin Lin’s faces changed because they could feel the incoming danger. But before they could react, they were enveloped in silver moonlight. Suddenly, their bodies started to break as they fell from the sky.

With just one punch, Luo Chen and Qin Lin landed on the ground next to Jun Mengchen. Since Jun Mengchen was restricted by Yu Haotian, he couldn’t even move from his kneeling position. But compared to him, Luo Chen and Qin Lin both had their faces distorted with pain and realized that they couldn’t move.

Yu Haotian stood in the sky enveloped with moonlight and black astral flames. He looked down at Luo Chen, Qin Lin, and Jun Mengchen with mockery in his eyes.

“Chief of the seven heads? You’re just a joke.” Yu Haotian snorted. He then raised his head to look at Pei Xue with cold light flickering in his pupils.

Can it be that he wants to make a move against Pei Xue? This scene made everyone nervous because they knew that Pei Xue had a mysterious origin. After all, Mu Xiuhan and Luo Chen didn’t dare to provoke her. Although no one knew about her origin, they all had a rough guess.

So if Yu Haotian dared to provoke her, it would surely cause a huge ripple and shake the entire Heavenly Path. Yu Haotian could naturally tell that this woman’s origin wasn’t simple and that there was a terrifying power sealed within her body that made him feel fearful. If he could, he didn’t want to provoke her. But she had ruined his scheme earlier when he tried to plot against Lin Yun.

This fact alone made him angry. He wanted to kill her with every fiber of his being, even more than he wanted to kill Luo Chen. After all, he couldn’t afford having her interfere with his fight.

“You think you’re invincible just because you obtained the Divine Shadow Glove by luck? Your chest must be hurting right now, right? The feeling of having your heart chewed on by the remnant demonic soul isn’t that easy to bear,” smiled Pei Xue.

When Yu Haotian heard that, his eyes flashed even colder. Somehow, Pei Xue knew the origin of his glove and its flaws. Looking at Pei Xue, killing intent began to surge around Yu Haotian, “You don’t have to worry about that. I don’t wish to fight you. Leave now and I will spare your life.”

Yu Haotian’s words left the spectators shocked. After all, they had all roughly guessed Pei Xue’s origin. If their speculation was true, then Pei Xue’s existence was like a deity in the Heavenly Path and no one would dare to provoke her. But Yu Haotian actually told her to get lost and looked like he wanted kill her.

They already knew that Lin Yun, who was also from the Profound Amber Realm, was arrogant. But Yu Haotian’s arrogance practically broke their minds. It appeared that he had been suppressing himself for a long time and finally removed his shackles.

Pei Xue smiled when he heard that, “You’re afraid that I’ll help Lin Yun when he comes out?”

Hearing what Pei Xue said, Yu Haotian’s killing intent surged even more. He no longer hid his killing intent while looking at Pei Xue, “It’s not a good thing for a woman to be too smart. The opportunity above fortune isn’t that easy to obtain. I hope that he can come out alive so that I can trample on him. But before that, you can leave your life behind!”

The moment Yu Haotian finished his words, the flames blazed even more ferociously on his glove. The black astral flames weren’t like normal astral flames because they emitted an ancient aura. That aura naturally came from the incomplete divine rune and that was named Divine Shadow. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I’m just afraid that you don’t have that ability!” Pei Xue’s expression was indifferent as a purple spear appeared in her hand. Then, purple light distorted all around her.

“Then you’ve really underestimated me!” Yu Haotian laughed and executed his inheritance from the Azure Dragon Palace for the first time. It was a terrifying movement technique that transformed him into an azure dragon. When the dragon moved, space began to distort from the dragon’s terrifying thunderstorm energy.

The pressure caused the entire plaza to tremble violently as a huge azure dragon charged towards Pei Xue. This scene caused Pei Xue’s face to change because she never expected that Yu Haotian had already grasped his inheritance from the Azure Dragon Palace.

Her inheritance was too profound, so she had only touched its surface. But Yu Haotian seemed to have someone guiding him since he had already grasped it. After all, Yu Haotian didn’t obtain the opportunity above fortune and there was no way the dragon spirit would guide him.

Caught by surprise, Pei Xue suffered a huge loss as she spit up some blood. She was sent flying out a few hundred meters before she managed to stabilize herself. Then, cracks spread out on the stage that Yu Haotian landed on while runes started to dissipate.

“That’s the opportunity above fortune?” Those who saw Yu Haotian’s movement technique for the first time couldn’t believe their eyes.

“Doesn’t seem like it. Judging from their conversation, the opportunity above fortune was obtained by Lin Yun.”

“But that attack is too terrifying. No wonder Luo Chen, Qin Lin, and Jun Mengchen lost. Even without that glove, there’s no way they can compete with Yu Haotian.” Yu Haotian’s strength had truly shocked everyone.

“Still not undoing your seal?” Yu Haotian raised his brow and smiled coldly, looking at torn clothes on Pei Xue without any reservation. Pei Xue’s eyes blazed with rage because this was the first time she loathed someone this much in the Heavenly Path.

“Tsk, tsk. You’re such a rare beauty that you look charming even when you’re angry.” Yu Haotian licked his lips and smiled, “Still not undoing your seal? Looks like you’re placing your hope on your little lover. But it’s a pity that Lin Yun is a piece of trash. If he manages to come out alive, he will be forced to kneel before me. I’ve changed my mind. I’m not going to kill you. I’ll wait for him to come out and then you’ll see who’s the strongest in the Azure Dragon Region!”

Yu Haotian was filled with unparalleled confidence and he even felt invincible after defeating Pei Xue with one attack. Before Pei Xue could respond, an outburst of terrifying aura suddenly swept out in the plaza as the azure dragon’s heart stage shined brightly. With the brilliant light, a figure slowly walked out.

“I heard that you were waiting for me.” A voice sounded out as the brilliance slowly dissipated. The crowd became excited because Lin Yun was finally here. And it was Lin Yun who had obtained the opportunity above fortune!
