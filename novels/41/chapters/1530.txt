Chapter 1531 - Master Is Old

Lin Yun wore a grave expression as he raised the painting with both hands, and his tone was filled with helplessness. He had two trump cards that could resolve this matter. One was the Firmament Battle Cloth that was left to him by the Azure Dragon Lord, and the other would be this painting given to him by his master.

But he knew that if he used the Firmament Battle Cloth, it would bring a great amount of trouble to him, and the news of it would leak out. At that time, he wouldn’t be able to stay in the Sword Sect any longer. After all, he did not doubt the potential of the Firmament Battle Cloth, and it would definitely draw a lot of unwanted attention.

He had no idea what grade it was, but it was definitely a treasure related to the god battle in the golden era. He wouldn't hesitate to use it if it only brought Lin Yun some trouble. But there was a high possibility that the Firmament Battle Cloth would bring trouble to the Sword Sect and many people, which he couldn’t accept.

If Tian Jue didn’t previously make a move against An Liuyan and he successfully left, there wouldn’t be so much trouble. At that time, only Qiu Qiong would probably catch up to him. At that time, he could use the Firmament Battle Cloth to get rid of Qiu Qiong, and no one would see it.

But he didn’t have a choice now, and using the painting was painful to Lin Yun because what Qiu Qiong said wasn’t wrong; his master was in seclusion. If it was a normal situation, it shouldn’t be an issue for his master to descend with a clone. But his master was in seclusion right now, which meant there would be a huge price to pay.

So Lin Yun’s hatred for Qiu Qiong reached the limit. The other Samsara Edict Realm experts were fine, but Qiu Qiong kept trying to force him. His hands were trembling when he held onto the painting. At this moment, he felt useless because he didn’t want to use this painting.

His hatred for Qiu Qiong was brought over to the Netherworld Hall. Even if Qiu Qiong died, he wouldn’t forget or let the Netherworld Hall go.

The Samsara Edict Realm experts of the seven demonic sects had fear flashing across their pupils when they heard what Lin Yun said, and they were surprised that the Radiant Sword Saint would descend a clone there.

The Radiant Sword Saint has lived for too long, and there were rumors that the Radiant Sword Saint was already running out of lifespan. If he couldn’t take another step further in his cultivation, the Eastern Desolation would only have two Sword Saints left. But the Radiant Sword Saint was still alive. So as long as he was still alive, his name would be a huge intimidation.

Even Qiu Qiong wasn’t an exception. But he soon calmed down and coldly said, “Are you trying to scare me? I refuse to believe that the old geezer…”

But before he could finish, the painting in Lin Yun’s hand glowed brightly, and holy light swept out from it. As the painting flew out from Lin Yun’s hand and unscrolled itself in mid-air, the Radiant Sword Saint’s portrait was soon revealed in the eyes of everyone.

The Radiant Sword Saint looked vivid with grey hair and beard in the painting, but his eyes were sharp.

“It’s really the Radiant Sword Saint!” The Samsara Edict Realm of the various demonic sects were shocked, and they could no longer conceal the fear in their hearts. Simultaneously, they inwardly rejoiced, especially those from the Heavenly Astral Pavilion; they could feel their backs being covered in a cold sweat.

They all rejoiced that they didn’t listen to Tian Jue; otherwise, they wouldn’t even know how they died.

“H-How is this possible…?” Qiu Qiong’s eyes nearly fell out of the eye sockets, and he couldn’t believe what he saw. The Netherworld Hall was the leader of the seven demonic sects, and their foundation was stronger than the likes of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. This meant that they had a greater information network. He was sure that the Radiant Sword Saint was in seclusion, and he knew that the Radiant Sword Saint only had five years left, and he might shorten his lifespan further by descending his clone.

Just who the hell was Lin Yun? Not only did he have the medal personally given to him by Mu Xuankong, but the Radiant Sword Saint was also willing to descend for him, even at the expense of his lifespan.

While everyone felt uncertain, a person walked out from the painting, and the entire asteroid belt was enveloped in a boundless saint aura. This aura shocked everyone because they knew the Radiant Sword Saint’s clone had arrived.

“Who dares to bully my disciple?” The Radiant Sword Saint coldly looked around as he unleashed his killing aura.

“Juniors pay our respect to the sword saint!” Under the Radiant Sword Saint’s killing aura, everyone, including the Samsara Edict Realm elders, fell onto their knees. They couldn’t bear that killing aura at all.

Only Qiu Qiong gritted his teeth to endure the saint aura and cupped his hands. “Qiu Qiong of the Netherworld Hall!”

“Talk with your knees on the ground!” The Radiant Sword Saint didn’t even bat an eye at Qiu Qiong before pressing down with his hand. This instantly made Qiu Qiong throw out a mouthful of blood before he fell onto his knees.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“This useless disciple pays his respects to Master!” Lin Yun’s feelings were complicated as he knelt before his master’s clone. His head was lowered, and he didn’t dare to look at his master.

“Raise your head and talk.” The Radiant Sword Saint furrowed his brows.

But Lin Yun gritted his teeth and didn’t dare to raise his head. He was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to control his tears.

“Senior, this person wants to dig out Lin Yun’s Blue Dragon Bone and even stop him from leaving!” But An Liuyan didn’t have such reservations while pointing her finger at Qiu Qiong.

When the Radiant Sword Saint heard what An Liuyan said, a terrifyingly cold light flashed through his pupils. Everyone could feel a chill down their spine, and fear began to loom over everyone’s hearts.

“Hahaha!” An arrogant laughter suddenly echoed as Qiu Qiong slowly got back on his feet. When he stood up, his aura began to rise and a saint's aura was being emitted from within his body, which left everyone shocked.

Everyone was shocked that Qiu Qiong had the aura of a saint while he was only at the Samsara Edict Realm. This meant that Qiu Qiong could now be called a quasi-Saint.

After everyone was briefly stunned, they soon realized that Qiu Qiong was already a quasi-Saint, which was probably why he dared to be so arrogant.

“Haha! I am a man of my actions!” Qiu Qiong’s eyes radiated with demonic light as he continued, “You want to scare me with a mere clone?”

Seeing that the Radiant Sword Saint was merely looking at him and said nothing, Qiu Qiong continued, “You’re old, and this is no longer your era. I won’t hesitate to let him go when he says your name. Let’s not mention that you’re only a clone, but my Netherworld Hall doesn’t fear you, even if you were to descend personally. Don’t think I don’t know you only have five years left. There’s no way you can make it through this. You would’ve made it over if you could, and you wouldn’t have to be in seclusion right now.”

“It’s been a long time since anyone has dared to speak to me in this manner. It looks like I’m really old…” The Radiant Sword Saint squinted his eyes.

“You don’t have to be humble. Even if you’re old, you’re still one of the three Sword Saints of the Eastern Desolation.” Qiu Qiong replied. “But since you’re here, I’ll give you some face. You can leave with him, but it’s best for young people to not be arrogant. After all, you might not be able to save him next time! Radiant Sword Saint, this is no longer your era.”

“Hahaha!” The Radiant Sword Saint suddenly laughed before he roared, “A mere quasi-Saint dares to speak to me in this manner? Then let me take a good look at you!”

When the Radiant Sword Saint widened his eyes and looked at Qiu Qiong for the first time, Qiu Qiong subconsciously raised his head and looked at the Radiant Sword Saint.

In the next moment, a boundless sword intent charged into Qiu Qiong’s body and destroyed his eyes.

“MY EYES!” Qiu Qiong suddenly panicked as he touched his bloodied eye sockets. But before he could do anything, boundless sword intent charged out from his body and blew his head apart. Just like that, a quasi-Saint died.

This scene left everyone dumbfounded, and many people were trembling in so much fear that they didn’t even dare to raise their heads. The Heavenly Astral Pavilion’s Chang Cheng was also shocked by the Radiant Sword Saint’s strength to use a single glance from his clone to kill a quasi-Saint like Qiu Qiong.

It wasn’t as though the Heavenly Astral Pavilion didn’t have any saints, and he had also seen their saints before. But he had never seen such a powerful saint before.

After the Radiant Sword Saint landed before Lin Yun and helped him up, he said, “Don’t overthink it. As long as I’m still alive, no one can touch you. This is just a clone, and it won’t affect me that much.”

Lin Yun looked at the Radiant Sword Saint and had a lot of words to say, but he couldn’t utter a single word.

“Not bad. You’ve actually obtained a dragon bone. I’m happy for you.” The Radiant Sword Saint wore a gratified smile as he looked at Lin Yun’s chest. “Why didn’t you use the painting earlier?”

“I still wanted to try and resolve this on my own…” Lin Yun explained.

“They’re right. I’m old, and relying on my name alone is not enough for me to intimidate some people.” The Radiant Sword Saint said with some disappointment on his face.

This instantly made Lin Yun anxious, and he replied, “Master, don’t listen to them. I’m sure that you can take that step out!”

“Hahaha!” The Radiant Sword Saint laughed. “I appreciate it, but everyone will grow old one day. I’ve long tossed life and death to the back of my mind. But even if I’m dead, I’ll personally make a trip to the Netherworld Hall. I’ll tell them that no one can touch you as long as I’m still alive!”

When he was done, he suddenly disappeared before Lin Yun.
