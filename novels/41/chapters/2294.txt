Chapter 2295 - Curtain Falls

“My Radiant’s lineage likes to fight with a disadvantage in numbers!” Ye Guhan pulled Lin Yun behind him and smiled.

“The Azure River Sword Saint has become a Great Saint?”

“There are rumors that he defeated the Blood Moon Sect’s clone on the ninth in the Heavenly Dao Sect.”

“This means two Sword Saints are from the Radiant’s lineage!”

“Don’t forget that genius from two decades ago. Based on his accumulation, it would be unimaginable the moment he becomes a Saint.”

“I heard that the Divine Firmament Peak’s peak master has long become a Saint. But I have no idea if he has grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent.”

The sudden appearance of Ye Guhan forcibly knocked back the Thousand Seal Great Saint, with everyone shocked. When he mentioned the “Radiant’s lineage,” this made everyone think of the Radiant Sword Saint’s other disciples.

Two powerful auras descended from the sky outside the God Burial Mountain Range. They were the two Great Saints that Ye Guhan called out to, the Indigo Mirror Great Saint and Grey Elegance Great Saint. The two figures landed beside the Thousand Seal Great Saint.

“Not bad.” Ye Guhan squinted. He continued, “Do the two of you want some face? You dare bully my junior brother, who isn’t a Great Saint?”

The Thousand Seal Great Saint said, “I didn’t make a move against him. I wanted to know who was the one talking that even disregarded the ancestor of my Ming Cult.”

Everyone had to admit that the commotion created by Lil’ Purple was a little intimidating, especially after she used the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, which contained a terrifying divinity and a powerful aura that shocked all the Saint Sovereigns present. Even the Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign was scared to the point that he gave himself three slaps.

“Hmph. When I was still in the Kunlun Realm, the ancestor of your Ming Cult was nothing before me.” Lil’ Purple was in the sky with three Sovereign Divine Runes illuminating her figure, making her look like a deity.

“What’s your name, then?” The Thousand Seal Great Saint snorted. He naturally wouldn’t believe Lil’ Purple’s words since the Ming Cult’s ancestor was a person from a hundred thousand years ago.

“Listen well, then. I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!” Lil’ Purple spoke out.

“The Heavenly Slaughter Empress?”

“Who is this person…?” Everyone was dumbfounded because they had never heard of this name before.

But the Astral River Saint Sovereign and Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign’s faces changed. Even Ji Zixi frowned as she muttered, “Uncle Xinghe, why does that name sound so familiar?”

“That’s impossible.” The Astral River Saint Sovereign still had shock on his face. He and the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign said nothing as they looked at Lil’ Purple with doubt.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Heavenly Slaughter Empress? How dare you humiliate the ancestor of my Ming Cult! Let me see how strong you are then!” The Thousand Seal Great Saint charged at the three divine radiances in the sky.

Ye Guhan didn’t stop him, since he moved a little to guard Lin Yun better. After all, the Thousand Seal Great Saint wasn’t honest earlier. Despite claiming he wanted to probe the ‘Heavenly Slaughter Empress,’ he was aiming for Lin Yun instead.

“Junior Brother, do you know who this empress is?” Ye Guhan smiled, looking at Lin Yun.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched. A fight had already occurred when he wanted to speak since a Great Saint was fast. The Thousand Seal Great Saint charged as he spread his hands apart with a sun and moon appearing in his palms, shooting two light beams.

“Carry on with your act!” The Thousand Seal Great Saint charged as he shattered the golden clouds and attacked Lil’ Purple.

“You’re courting death!” The Lil’ Purple wasn’t afraid and waved her hand with terrifying lightning illuminating the sky, making her figure even more blurred. When she pushed her hand down, golden lightning descended that knocked the Thousand Seal Great saint away.

The Thousand Seal Great Saint clasped his hands with the sun and moon merging to form a ‘Ming’ word, blocking the incoming golden lightning. The Thousand Seal Great Saint was briefly stunned before he charged over, “Not bad…”

Three divine radiances blocked all of the Thousand Seal Great Saint’s attacks. The two exchanged over ten-odd moves in the blink of an eye, with the Thousand Seal Great Saint being in a disadvantageous position.

Lin Yun’s face changed as he frowned. He felt that something wasn’t right. Since when did Lil’ Purple become so powerful? Since she had come out, where was Su Ziyao?

At the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s party, an elegant elder donning white appeared beside the two Saint Sovereigns.

This alarmed the two Saint Sovereigns as they started to bow, “Great Saint…”

But the old man shook his head, gazing at Lil’ Purple with a grave expression.

“Get lost!” Lil’ Purple roared as she executed the Sun-Moon Seal. The shocking scene reappeared with a sun and a moon above everyone’s heads. Under the suppression of the two stars, the entire sky was dragged down, which greatly pressured everyone. Before the Thousand Seal Great Saint could respond, he was struck by the combination of the two stars, producing a huge commotion as blood dripped out from the Thousand Seal Great Saint and he was sent flying away.

“Brother Thousand Seal…” The Indigo Mirror and Grey Elegance Great Saints quickly rushed over.

The Thousand Seal Great Saint’s eyes were filled with doubts. This attack might have caused a huge commotion, but he only suffered light injuries when he expected to suffer heavy injuries. But the attack's power was real, so he became baffled.

While Lin Yun was also shocked, Lil’ Purple’s anxious voice resounded, “I can’t hold on any longer. I have used all the power in the three sovereign Divine Runes. Get your senior brother to help out!”

Lin Yun was shocked, with the corner of his lips twitching as he saw the Thousand Seal Great Saint charging back into the sky. He called out, “Senior Brother!”

Ye Guhan was stunned before smiling, “I got it.”

“Come back!” He immediately moved and space collapsed, restricting the Thousand Seal Great Saint. With a smile, Ye Guhan waved his hand, and the Thousand Seal Great Saint was dragged back.

When the Thousand Seal Great Saint landed on the ground, he took a few steps back before he looked at Ye Guhan, exclaiming, “Space Dao!”

He wasn’t sure earlier, but he was now sure that Ye Guhan had become a Great Saint and had grasped one of the nine Eternal Daos, Space Dao.

“Not bad. At least you have some eyesight.” Ye Guhan smiled and stepped forward, “Play with me instead. The three of you can come at me together. I will then bring my junior brother with me today, whether you guys like it or not.”

When the three Great Saints came to their senses, their faces changed as their gazes fell onto Lin Yun. The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Great Saint and Saint Sovereigns also approached Ye Guhan’s side.

The Myriad Lightning Sect’s Grey Elegance Great Saint rolled his eyes, and said, “Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign, do you still mean what you said earlier? We can leave if you hand over the divine flame fragment.”

The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign smiled, “Sorry about that. The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign already rejected my suggestion.”

The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign’s face became ashen. He was too arrogant earlier and was now placed in a difficult position. Regardless of Ye Guhan, who grasped Space Dao or the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Great Saint, their arrival meant they couldn't take Lin Yun away with them.

The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Great Saint said, “Let’s end it here. It’s not time for holy lands to fight amongst ourselves yet. Since you guys didn’t immediately make a move, I believe you guys must have your concerns. As for Lin Yun, he’s a junior. If the three holy lands’ younger generation wants to take revenge against him, the Divine Phoenix Mountain won’t interfere. I believe the Azure River Sword Saint wouldn’t interfere as well.”

The white-clothed Great Saint turned to look at Ye Guhan, who smiled. There was no issue with his words, but they sounded sarcastic to the Thousand Seal Great Saint and the Ming Cult’s Saint Elders.

Lin Yun had become the Flower Burial Sword Saint, so where could the three holy lands find a younger generation who could fight him? Coming after Lin Yun was no different than courting death, but what the white-clothed Great Saint said was reasonable, and they couldn’t find a way to refute it. This meant they would have to weigh the pros and cons if they wanted to move against Lin Yun.

The three holy lands lost several Saint Lords in Lin Yun’s hands from today's battle, and many were heavily injured. In other words, sending Saint Lords to fight Lin Yun was no different from sending them to their death. This meant that they could only swallow the losses today.

The Thousand Seal Great Saint coldly said, “We admit defeat today, and the Radiant’s lineage is truly impressive. I hope the Radiant Sword Saint can endure his tribulation without trouble. Don’t forget who has the final say in the Eastern Desolation.”

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with rage while Ye Guhan squinted with a smile, “Thanks for your wishes, and I believe my master’s tribulation will be smooth. I don’t know who has the final say in the Eastern Desolation, but it’s not Tian Xuanzi or you guys.”

The Thousand Seal Great Saint’s face was cold before he knocked the Iris Sword Box flying away. He then retrieved the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign. The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s body was destroyed, but he was still alive. Seeing the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s injuries, the Thousand Seal Great Saint recalled how Huang Jingyu died, and his face became terrifyingly dark.

“Let’s go!” The three holy lands left, indicating that everything had come to an end. But everyone knew that this was far from over, since there would be another battle during the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation.

“Young lad, we’re grateful for the divine flame fragment,” the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Last Sky Great Saint expressed his gratitude while looking at Lin Yun.

Ye Guhan smiled, “Last Sky Great Saint, it’s no longer appropriate to call my junior brother a young lad. He has become a Sword Saint.”

The Last Sky Great Saint played along, and smiled, “Hahaha! We’re grateful to the Flower Burial Sword Saint!”

Everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain also cupped their fists together, ““We’re grateful to the Flower Burial Sword Saint!””

This was the first time Lin Yun experienced this, making him smile, “It’s nothing. You guys are too polite.”

Ye Guhan nodded with a smile when he saw this scene. That’s more like it. Since his junior brother had become a Sword Saint, how could he be addressed as a young lad?

Not bad. You have grown up. Ye Guhan inwardly said as he caressed Lin Yun’s head with a smile.

Ji Zixi took a step forward with her eyes shining brightly. She couldn’t hold back her excitement but was even more polite than the Last Sky Great Saint. She said, “Big Brother Lin, why don’t you come with us to the Divine Phoenix Mountain? You promised me back in the Heavenly Void.”
