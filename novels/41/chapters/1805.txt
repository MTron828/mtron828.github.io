Chapter 1806 - Funeral Song

Mei Zihua rose to the sky, luring the vengeful spirits away. This made Cheng Tong and the others let out a breath of relief before they asked in a worried tone, “Will anything happen to him? This place isn’t safe, and he’ll be in danger if he loses his way.”

“Don’t worry. He might not seem reliable, but he’s strong.” Lin Yun said casually.

“Who is he? His attainment in music dao doesn’t look simple, and his name should be at the Nirvana Banquet, right?” Someone asked curiously.

“Mei Zihua.” Lin Yun replied.

This instantly made Cheng Tong’s group of three surprised. He asked, “He’s Mei Zihua?”

Everyone quickly turned their heads over and saw a crimson radiance being emitted from Mei Zihua, forming into a vermilion bird beneath his feet. No matter how the vengeful spirits chased after him, they couldn’t catch up no matter what.

“He’s a descendant from one of the Ten Musical Clans?” Cheng Tong asked in a shocked tone.

When Lin Yun nodded his head, Cheng Tong exclaimed, “He doesn’t look like one at all.”

There were rumors that this descendant of the Ten Musical Clans had a foul temper, was arrogant and would make a move if anyone disagreed with him. But before Lin Yun, he seemed to be in a weaker position, so it was quite different from the rumors. This instantly made everyone curious about Lin Yun again.

There were rumors that he was a descendant of the Azure Dragon’s lineage who went to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain to cultivate. Perhaps that was all real, since only someone with such a status could suppress the descendants of the Ten Musical Clans. Who knows, he might be the descendant of an Emperor! Otherwise, it would make no sense as to why Mei Zihua would show such a weaker side in their friendship. The three frantically brainstormed, and became even more respectful towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun naturally had no idea what they were thinking about, so he changed the topic, “Brother Cheng, do you know the Black Tortoise Void Sea well?”

“More or less.” Cheng Tong said modestly. “The three of us will come here four to five times a year. The demonic beasts here have a chance of possessing a saint crystal within their bodies. Saints need saint crystals, but they can’t come here. So this gave us an opportunity.”

The saint crystals were valuable, born in the bodies of demonic beasts that lived in the battlefields of deities. This was a mutation after the demonic beasts were tainted with the deities’ energies. Coupled with several other unknown factors, the descendants of demonic beasts woud have a saint crystal within their bodies.

Saint crystals could be used by saints to temper their saint origin, physique, and martial intent. If they were fortunate, they could even be able to comprehend the power of deities. But it was impossible for experts at the Samsara Edict Realm to use them because the energy contained within them wasn’t pure, not to mention the energy contained in the saint crystals was too powerful.

But saint crystals were treasures to saints, and even the most ordinary saint crystal would be snatched in the outside world. Not to mention a saint crystal with a high grade could be sold for high prices.

This was also why the Black Tortoise Void Sea was filled with people and Samsara Edict Realm experts would often come here for an adventure.

“But recently, it hasn’t been peaceful since various people have been coming here. No one knows what will happen.” Cheng Tong looked nervous, and there was a trace of anticipation in his tone.

But his words were enough to state that the Black Tortoise Void Sea wouldn’t be peaceful, and they might run into great opportunities.

“I read from a scroll that this place isn’t the same and that there are many unknowns.” Lin Yun said with his head raised up.

Nodding his head, Cheng tong said, “This was the battlefield for deities, so there are many taboos here. Just try not to touch them. Take those vengeful spirits, for example. Don’t be confused by their singing or you’ll be lured to the Dead Sea and killed. In those places, even saints might not be able to come back alive.

The Dead Sea was located at the depths of the Black Tortoise Void Sea, and there were many legends revolving around that place. Lin Yun also read from a scroll that one had to be careful there.

“A lot of people died here. So we just have to be cautious.” The old man who was dressed like a beggar said as he took a sip of wine.

“Mister, you’ve not stopped drinking ever since we boarded this Black Tortoise Ship. It looks like you have good alcohol resistance.” Cheng Tong smiled.

“You want some?” The old man smiled.

“No, it’s fine.” Cheng tong pinched his nose and quickly took a few steps back.

“Hahaha! You don’t know wine, and this is my best one. It has been accumulated for a thousand years, so it naturally tastes special.” The old man smiled, and turned to look at Lin Yun. He asked, “Young lad, do you want some?”

But Lin Yun didn’t say a word. This made the old man smile before passing his wine to the man wearing a bamboo hat. But that man emitted wisps of his killing intent to state his attitude.

This made the old man awkwardly smile, but he wasn’t too bothered about it.

“Give me some. I’d like to try.” The woman said.

The old man was briefly stunned, but he did not get close to her. On the contrary, he even shifted himself away from her instead.

“Am I that scary?” The woman smiled.

“No, no.” The old man was clearly frightened, but he quickly handed the wine over with his hands trembling.

When the woman took the wine, she didn’t drink it but smiled, instead. “Sure enough, it’s the Incineration Moon. I’ll be accepting this then, thanks.”

She immediately pocketed the wine, but the old man didn’t dare to utter a word.

“Old man, come and sit next to me. We can have a good chat. I have a lot of research in wine.” The woman smiled, but her smile made everyone feel a chill run down their spines.

“No, it’s alright.” The old man was flustered, and this made Cheng Tong feel weird.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Come over to me.” Lin Yun pulled the old man over beside him, and this made the old man feel relieved.

“Big Brother Cheng, some of my friends are coming. So I'd like to ask you and your friends to leave first.” Lin Yun said, looking at Cheng Tong.

“We’ve not reached the Black Tortoise Void Sea yet…” The person beside Cheng Tong said.

But Cheng Tong interrupted him and asked, “Young Master Lin, you’re in trouble?”

“Don’t be too sure about that. Who knows, perhaps these friends are the ones in trouble, instead?” Lin Yun smiled.

The two people beside Cheng Tong still wanted to say something, but Cheng Tong could sense that something was amiss. He immediately dragged the two and jumped off the Black Tortoise Ship, heading towards the Black Tortoise Void Sea by themselves. This place wasn’t far from the Black Tortoise Void Sea. So even without the Black Tortoise Ship, it wasn’t a problem for the three of them, since they were proficient with this place.

Not long later, Lin Yun suddenly stood up. He said, “You two should get going as well. My friends will be here soon.”

The woman and the man wearing a bamboo hat didn’t say a word, and this naturally made the atmosphere tense. Right then, the old man smiled, “Since your friends are coming, I’ll get going first.”

“I’m pretty fated with you, so you can stay behind.” Lin Yun placed his hand on the old man’s shoulder, stopping him from getting up.

This made the old man want to cry and feel depressed. Suddenly, the woman broke the silence and smiled, “Since your friends are here, I’ll not disrupt you guys, then.”

She slowly stood up and took two steps forth. Right then, a huge wave rose from the sea, swaying the Black Tortoise Ship. This caught the woman by surprise as she fell towards Lin Yun’s direction.

When she accidentally placed her hand on Lin Yun’s chest, Lin Yun quickly reached out and grabbed onto her wrist. When her hand fell onto his chest, he had already circulated the Divine Tortoise Transformation to conceal the Blue Dragon Bone.

“Thank you.” The woman smiled apologetically before distancing herself. But when she parted, there was disappointment flashing across her pupils.

Lin Yun nodded before slowly releasing his grip on her wrist.

Right at this moment, the man also stood up and turned around to look for the ‘friends’ Lin Yun mentioned. He swiftly jumped off the ship. But when he brushed past Lin Yun, a sharp gaze shot out, to which Lin Yun coldly glared back at him.

“Champion of the Nirvana Banquet, your courage is impressive to remain so calm, even when you’re about to die. Your courage is similar to a friend of mine.” The man said.

Taking a deep glance at the other party, Lin Yun said, “You can stay behind and see how much I resemble your friend.”

"Let's talk about it after you survive." The man said coldly, his face changing under the bamboo hat. He no longer stayed behind and left the Black Tortoise Ship.

“Young Master, take care.” The woman smiled before she left, chasing after the man and rushing towards the Black Tortoise Sea.

When the old man turned back, he could see a Black Tortoise Ship swiftly approaching them.

Lin Yun executed the Divine Dragon Eyes to look, and saw the Wind Edge Lord standing on the Black Tortoise Ship. Aside from him, there were four Profound Life Stage experts from the Liu Saint Clan there.

Seeing them, a cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, and he wore a faint smile. He then turned to the old man and said, “Stop pretending. I can already tell who you are with one glance.”

“Don’t bullshit. I don’t know you at all.” The old man said.

“Drink it along the way.” With a smile, Lin Yun took out a Dragon Clan’s wine and handed it to the old man before he soared to the sky. He executed his movement technique and headed in the opposite direction.

“What are you trying to do?” The old man asked in shock.

As Lin Yun traveled on the surface of the ocean, he replied, “I’ll look for you later.”

The old man held onto the jar and fell into deep thoughts before he breathed out a sigh.

Lin Yun moved away from the Black Tortoise Void Sea’s direction before retrieving the Divine Indigo Bamboo Flute and started playing it on a reef. His melody wasn’t as fancy as Mei Zihua, but it was filled with an unimaginable murderous aura.

An hour later, the Wind Edge Lord arrived with the four Profound Life Stage elders. The Black Tortoise Ship they rode was like a gust of wind and stopped a thousand meters away from the reef Lin Yun was standing on.

The Wind Edge Lord was holding onto his fan, looking extraordinary at first glance. Seeing Lin Yun, who was playing the flute on the reef, he smiled, “Lin Xiao, who are you playing this funeral song for?”

As Lin Yun lowered the Divine Indigo Bamboo Flute, he said, “Well, I’m not exactly certain who this funeral song is for.”
