Chapter 661 - Dare To Take My Sword

Lin Yun’s words had shocked everyone. While everyone laughed, Jin Yan’s arrogant expression became playful and he sneered, “It looks like defeating Ji Wuye has made you rather full of yourself. But, no matter. I’ll teach you the difference between you and the geniuses in the Thunder Prefecture.”

Suddenly, a powerful aura belonging to a Yin-Yang stage expert exploded out from Jin Yan. His aura was so condensed that a vague flame shrouded him. His aura had become like a blazing sun.

“That’s the Jin Clan’s Radiant Sun Scripture, a high earth grade cultivation technique. Based on the glossy flames, it looks like he reached the third stage.”

“There’s a huge difference between the Yang stage and the Yin-Yang stage, not to mention that Jin Yan has the Radiant Sun Scripture. I can’t imagine him losing.” When Jin Yan brought out the Radiant Sun Scripture, it caused a clamor in the surroundings.

“Don’t cry that the Skymound City is bullying you. If you can take ten moves from me, then consider it my loss,” smiled Jin Yan as he looked at Lin Yun with pride.

Interesting… These people really have a strong attachment to their prefecture. But is this really something for them to be proud of?

Lin Yun’s body flashed and he landed on the stage with a playful smile, “Ten moves? Actually, I can let you add a dozen more moves.”

“You’re courting death!” Jin Yan snorted as he threw his punch. He was using the Heavenly Flame Fist, a high earth rank fist technique, which was a perfect fit with the Radiant Sun Scripture. His fist technique was in greater mastery, but it was at least 50% stronger than other fist techniques of the same grade.

He had relied on this fist technique to defeat his opponent in three moves. Whenever his fist traveled, the air would burn and release a hot wave.

Facing the fist technique, Lin Yun calmly raised his hand, gathering ten lightning runes onto his fist. When Lin Yun’s punch clashed with Jin Yan’s punch, Lin Yun had only taken half a step back.

“Again!” Jin Yan locked his brows together as he was surprised by this outcome. Circulating his movement technique, Jin Yan divided into multiple figures that carried the might of a flaming mountain.

When he threw his punch out, the flaming mountains converged together and his fist technique looked like countless erupting volcanoes. Like a flaming dragon, Jin Yan’s attack came charging at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun had to admit that Jin Yan was truly powerful. Jin Yan was a lot stronger than Feng Wuhen, Bloodwolf, and Chief Leng, who had the same cultivation as Jin Yan. Lin Yun even had to give him credit for the intent contained in his fist technique. Jin Yan might be arrogant, but he had the strength to back up his arrogance.

But this much was nothing in Lin Yun’s eyes. With a single thought, thirty ancient lightning runes began to squirm on his chest, condensing into ancient azure dragon energy to face Jin Yan’s attack. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Another three exchanges later, the surrounding temperature had increased from Jin Yan’s attack. Jin Yan’s fist aura had slowly started to envelop the entire stage. But even so, Lin Yun didn’t seem injured.

Facing Jin Yan’s punches, Lin Yun stood firmly on the ground as fifteen lightning runes began to squirm on the surface of his body before merging with the Iris Sword Sutra. In the blink of an eye, seven moves passed and Jin Yan only had three moves left from the ten moves he previously claimed. Simultaneously, shock began to appear on everyone’s faces as they watched the battle.

“You’re indeed, somewhat capable. I can’t injure you with 50% of my strength, but this is the end!” Jin Yan’s eyes flashed coldly as he barked. In the next second, the flames around him had multiplied before overlapping and giving off a majestic aura.

Clearly, he didn’t use all his strength in the previous seven moves. Taking a step back, cracks quickly spread out on the ground as it was covered with spiritual runes that clearly couldn’t withstand the outburst of his origin energy. His entire arm was covered with flames as he threw a punch at Lin Yun.

“Heavenly Flame Dragonflash!” Jin Yan’s arm turned into a sinister dragon claw with countless flames pouring out. It looked like the claw would crush Lin Yun’s skull.

“This isn’t enough!” There was no change to Lin Yun’s face as his right hand bolted out and manifested into an azure dragon claw covered in lightning.

Azure Dragon Palm!

When the two dragon claws clashed in the air, they caused a violent explosion. Everyone was shocked at this scene because they couldn’t believe that Lin Yun had withstood the attack.

Looking at the azure-clothed youth descending onto the stage after the clash ended, Jin Yan began to feel impatient as his eyes flashed coldly. Tens of thousands of stars began to gather on the surface of his body before forming into a flaming armor.

“The Heavenly Flame Armor?” Xiang Tianhe was shocked by this scene as he continued, “It looks like he had hidden some of his trump cards.”

Qing Ruoyou spoke out from the side, “One can only manifest the Heavenly Flame Armor after reaching the sixth stage in the Radiant Sun Scripture. After all, the core of the Heavenly Flame Armor contains a wisp of heavenly flame. This Heavenly Flame Armor doesn’t even have a wisp of heavenly flame, so the appearance of the armor looks rather vague. He still has some ways to go compared to that direct descendant from the Jin Clan.”

“But it’s more than enough to deal with Lin Yun. Not only does this armor strengthen his defences, but it will also amplify his Heavenly Flame Fist by 50%,” said Xiang Tianhe as he nodded his head.

Qing Ruoyou didn’t reply, but she had clearly acknowledged Xiang Tianhe’s words. What unfolded next wasn’t a surprise as Lin Yun was sent nine meters back.

“Nice one!”

“Bravo!” Cheers came from the surrounding. After fighting for such a long time, Jin Yan had finally revealed the grace of a Skymound City’s genius. In the eyes of the crowd, Jin Yan’s strength was enough to teach Lin Yun a lesson.

“Not bad, but it still feels lacking.” Lin Yun stabilized himself and looked at Jin Yan with a playful smile as he wiped the blood off his lips.

“Let’s see how you can continue to pretend! Radiant Sun World!”

Those words made Jin Yan fly into rage as crimson flames began to blaze on the surface of his body, causing cracks on the ground. All the tiles within a hundred meter radius began to float in the sky while turning red from the high temperature.

In the next moment, the tiles began to fly out like meteors with long fiery tails. With an invincible demeanor, hundreds of crimson tiles flew towards Lin Yun. Jin Yan’s terrifying attack had caused the entire stage to tremble violently as everyone gathered their origin energy on the surface of their bodies.

“Looks like Jin Yan is becoming serious. This punch can injure an expert in the lesser Yin-Yang stage. I can’t imagine the harm it will cause when landing on a Yang stage expert.”

“Hmph, this arrogant brat deserves a lesson. He won’t be killed by it.”

“Even if he isn’t killed by it, that attack won’t feel that great…” Before the fist landed, everyone knew that Lin Yun’s defeat was imminent.

“Pitiful tricks!” Lin Yun’s clothes and hair began to flutter in the wind as he activated the Azure Dragon Mark on his chest. Instantly, thirty lightning runes began to squirm on his body as if they were alive. Along with a dragon roar, the ancient azure dragon energy began to fluctuate within his body.

In the next second, his figure made everyone feel as if he had grown majestic, like a towering mountain in the sky.

Azure Dragon Enneaform—Triform!

When Lin Yun’s aura reached its pinnacle, Lin Yun wore a rare savage expression as he threw a punch out.

His punch began to crackle with lightning as everything was torn apart by his fist. First, he destroyed the crimson fist, then he destroyed the crimson tiles. Under his punch, everything was reduced to ashes. In the next second, a dazzling lightning flashed along with a rumbling sound as if there was an army of stallions roaring through the field towards Jin Yan’s chest.

When Lin Yun’s punch landed on Jin Yan, Jin Yan’s body arched backwards like the body of a shrimp and he flew backwards. When he fell onto the ground, he threw up a mouthful of blood before he could even stabilize himself.

“This…” No one had expected that Jin Yan would actually be defeated by a punch as everything happened too quickly.

Looking at Jin Yan, Lin Yun said, “I’ve barely withstood ten of your moves. I have a sword named Flower Burial. Why don’t you take an attack from it as well?”

That wasn’t the end? Everyone’s faces changed as they never imagined that Lin Yun would have such a temper. Saying that he ‘barely withstood’ ten of Jin Yan’s moves was humiliating enough, but it turns out that Lin Yun actually wanted to take another step on Jin Yan.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun’s body trembled as the sword box fell to the ground. When the sword box fell to the ground, it caused the entire stage to tremble, silencing the crowd. The loud boom from the sword box falling onto the ground was like a hammer that struck everyone’s hearts.

“Skymound City’s Jin Yan, do you dare to take my sword?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he barked.

You act so arrogant just because you’re from Skymound City? Today, I, Lin Yun, will shatter your pride thoroughly.
