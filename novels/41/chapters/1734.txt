Chapter 1735 – What Do You Want To Listen To?

The surroundings of the Nirvana Stage fell into silence. When Yan Tianchen lowered the leaf in his hand, many people’s hearts trembled when he turned to coldly look at Di Qiu. In this fight, he showed everyone the might of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s chief disciple.

“Great!” Lin Yun clapped with a smile on his face. It was rare for him to be emotional; he was genuinely emotional now. He wouldn’t clap for anyone else, but Yan Tianchen was worthy.

“It looks like Senior Brother didn’t suffer so much for nothing.” Yue Weiwei smiled.

The surroundings fell into a dead silence, but Lin Yun’s clap woke everyone from shock. When everyone came to their senses, their gazes became complicated when they looked at Yan Tianchen.

Di Qiu’s popularity might not be higher than Li Yuxi, but it was undeniable that he was a genius, and his performance on the stage proved it all. After all, Di Qiu had practically suppressed everyone with the Seven Mourn Demonic Score. But he was unlucky because he ran into Yan Tianchen. This further made what Di Qiu said to Yan Tianchen earlier sound like ridicule.

“Two people have made it to the next round.” The judge announced after glancing at the pavilion master. Di Qiu might’ve lost, but he still made it to the next round according to the rules. Since the pavilion master loves talent, he naturally wouldn’t want to see Di Qiu being kicked out.

“Don’t let me run into you in the next round.” Di Qiu said coldly, wiping the blood off his lips.

“Oh.” Yan Tianchen replied.

The gaze of the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master was on Yan Tianchen right now. He glanced at the latter and nodded before looking at Mu Xueling. He smiled, “He should’ve gone to the divine mountain, right? The divine mountain is really impressive.”

The outcome of this battle was surprising, but Lin Yun wasn’t surprised at all. Yan Tianchen bore such considerable pressure, bearing everyone on his shoulders. So how could he allow himself to be defeated by the likes of Di Qiu? It would only be a humiliation to him if he lost.

“Pass.” The elders of the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion said.

As the banquet continued, more geniuses were being called out to fight. Lin Yun’s attention was also entirely focused on the stage. He wasn’t complacent, and his pupils were flickering. He was like a sponge absorbing everything he could learn.

“Interesting, the flute can also be used in this manner. Perhaps I can try it, but this is a shortcut, and there are a lot of flaws.”

He might seem calm, but his thoughts were processing at a swift speed. Suddenly, two names were called out, leaving Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei stunned before exchanging a glance. “Lin Yun, Yue Weiwei…”

They never expected that they would be arranged in a match together. When they stood up and went on the stage, they instantly became the center of attention.

“It’s the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s Lin Xiao and Profound Fairy!”

“That’s Lin Xiao? That barbarian who caused a mess at the West Garden Banquet?”

“That Profound Fairy is beautiful, and she looks compatible with that brat.” Lin Yun caused a mess at the West Garden Banquet, while Yue Weiwei was a peerless beauty. So their appearances naturally sparked controversy.

“How beautiful…” The spectators and even geniuses of holy lands and other musical houses were shocked by Yue Weiwei’s beauty.

“The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion actually has such a beauty?” Li Yuxi of the Ming Cult praised.

“Haha. Brother Li, you can arrange for a meeting between you two with the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion if you’re interested. I heard that this woman possesses breathtaking dancing skills.” The Flying Snow Pavilion’s Bai Yunfei smiled.

“Ha.” Li Yuxi smiled, but he didn’t say anything.

On the stage, Lin Yun casually found a corner to sit down with Yue Weiwei quietly standing beside him. She didn’t seem to care about anything aside from Lin Yun.

“Do you want to hear zither or flute music? Or something else?” Lin Yun turned to look at Yue Weiwei.

“Me?” Yue Weiwei initially wanted to say she would love anything Lin Yun plays. She suddenly thought of something and smiled, “The zither.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun responded, completely disregarding everyone else on the stage. His attitude instantly attracted everyone’s attention. He was even more arrogant than Di Qiu. After all, Di Qiu bothered to put on an act, but Lin Yun couldn’t even be bothered with that. He quickly went on the stage and disregarded everyone. Acting as though the Nirvana Stage was his backyard.

“This fellow is really arrogant!”

“He’s really as arrogant as the rumors.”

“Does ninety-odd people not exist in his eyes? Let’s deal with him first!” Everyone on the Nirvana Stage instantly became unhappy because Lin Yun was too arrogant. Most importantly, they were jealous. Yue Weiwei’s smile earlier was alluring, but her smile was for Lin Yun.

“Can’t he give us peace of mind…?” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi’s lips twitched, and they were worried for Lin Yun, worried that he would be ganged up on by everyone else.

“It’s natural, based on his reputation. For someone so outstanding like Junior Brother Lin, he can’t keep a low profile, even if he wanted to. Not to mention that he’s together with Junior Sister on the stage.” Yan Tianchen smiled.

“Senior Brother, why are you siding with him?” Luo Shuyi said unhappily. “You should advise him.”

But Yan Tianchen merely responded with a smile. He nearly went insane in his first meeting with Lin Yun, and it would be weird if Lin Yun could be persuaded. But these people all wanted to gang up on Lin Yun? He smiled because he knew it wouldn’t be easy.

When everyone who was called out went on the stage, a battle soon broke out. The ninety-eight people all unleashed their attacks towards Lin Yun, and the phenomenons created by their musical tones were terrifying.

This scene made Yue Weiwei’s face change, and the smile on her face changed to frost.

“Don’t worry, and just listen to the song.” Lin Yun said, to which Yue Weiwei responded with a smile and stayed where she was.

When the music resounded from the zither, Lin Yun’s music was calm, making everyone feel at peace. His music sounded like a performance, and it didn’t give off a feeling that he was in a battle. But his musical notes were even sharper than swords, and the various phenomena coming at him were torn to pieces before they even got close. In a split second, sounds of metal snapping could be heard.

This made everyone’s faces change, and they took a step back. They focused their mental energy on their musical instruments, and the musical notes played by them became even more terrifying.

But facing their attacks, Lin Yun merely smiled and strummed the zither. His speed was mediocre and nothing impressive. In the next second, a faint phoenix cry echoed from Lin Yun. He was playing the Prairie Phoenix Fire. He didn’t unleash the true artistic concept in his music, it was gentle. This was because this song was meant for Yue Weiwei, and he did not need to play it with ferocity.

His mental cultivation was terrifying. So even if this song didn’t contain any ferocity, when all the musical notes manifested into flames, they had combined to form an ocean of fire. Everyone else on the Nirvana Stage could feel that they were standing in an ocean, and the ocean was made up of torrential flames that rippled along with his music.

There were some who were knocked out and some who were swept to the sky. Like that, more and more of the ninety-eight people began to be eliminated.

Lin Yun’s music was beautiful, and many people have forgotten this was the Nirvana Banquet. They were fully immersed in Lin Yun’s zither music and its artistic concept. There was a phoenix cry in the music that sounded aloof. Even the fatal phoenix fire was gentle, like the warm sun in winter. But because of this music, the number of people on the stage began to decrease. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Suddenly, a shocking zither music explosion echoed, filled with helplessness and rage like a final struggle. Those immersed in the music came to their senses, and their jaws nearly fell off when they looked at the stage, “Oh my god. What happened?!”

This was because only eight people were left on the stage aside from Lin Yun, and the stage suddenly became spacious. Aside from the zither music, most people were eliminated by Lin Yun, which made everyone feel a chill run down their spines because this was too terrifying.

“That Lin Xiao is too terrifying, eliminating so many people without anyone knowing it.”

“His zither music is weird. It contained no killing intent, but no one could do anything about it.” While everyone was shocked, the flames sent two more people off of the stage.

“Let’s stop here.” Lin Yun sped up his pace, and dazzling flames exploded from him before the five could react. The entire stage was covered in a fire before manifesting into a phoenix and soaring to the sky. The phoenix entirely suppressed the five before they could do anything.

“How is it?” Lin Yun stowed the zither and looked at Yue Weiwei with a smile.

“It’s beautiful.” Yue Weiwei nodded.

Everyone’s lips twitched because Lin Yun clearly didn’t place the ninety-eight people in his eyes. Many people were looking forward to seeing Lin Yun being ganged up on by everyone, but who could’ve thought that the ninety-eight people would be powerless before Lin Yun from the start to the end?

“Gentleness is fatal.” The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master smiled when he looked at Lin Yun.

“Pass.” The elder said. He clearly wanted to chase Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei down from the stage as he was reaching his limit of looking at the two being so cheesy.

An unharmonious voice resounded, “The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s Profound Fairy only knows how to hide behind a man? Aren’t you too shameless to make it to the next round through this period? It looks like the Profound Fairy doesn’t deserve her reputation.”

When everyone turned to look at where the voice came from, their voices changed because it was from Hua Hongyu. She was the genius of the Myriad Flowers Hall and the most beautiful lady in the Heavenly Domain City.
