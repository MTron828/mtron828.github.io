Chapter 784 - The Heart of a Swordsman

Lin Yun’s words instantly caused a commotion among the audience because they were too arrogant. It was a foregone conclusion that he would defeat Ye Qingfeng.

Suddenly, a terrifying aura exploded from Ye Qingfeng, which caused the surrounding lakewater to roar violently.

“Quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm!” Many people exclaimed because no one thought that Ye Qingfeng was in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. This meant that there was a huge gap in cultivation between him and Lin Yun.

“The Indigomoon Elysium has really hidden their strength deeply. It won’t be easy for Lin Yun to win now.”

“The gap between their cultivation is too great, even if Lin Yun’s sword intent is powerful.”

“Lin Yun is eighteen years old, while Ye Qingfeng is twenty-four. Furthermore, Ye Qingfeng also came from the Indigomoon Elysium…” With similar talent and foundation, someone in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm naturally had a greater advantage against someone in the greater Yin-Yang stage.

Most geniuses could fight those above their cultivation, but that depended on the difference in talent and cultivation technique. If the cultivation technique and foundation were on the same level, then it was an impossible fight.

The experts of the fourth and seventh group fell into deep thought. No wonder he said that he wouldn’t lose before the ranking battle. With his foundation and talent, it would be tough for him to lose unless he ran into the three kings or seven elites.

It won’t be easy. Heavenly Sword Sect’s Li Mubai shook his head inwardly. As a swordsman, he knew that the odds of Lin Yun winning against Ye Qingfeng weren’t high. It was a shame that the legend of this dark horse would come to an end. Afterall, he had grown pretty fond of Lin Yun. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Hmph, does he really think that our Indigomoon Elysium is weak?” The Indigomoon Elysium’s party hate Lin Yun to the core. No matter what, they had to get their face back through this battle.

“He’s still not going to admit defeat? This fellow is really stubborn. The Indigomoon Elysium isn’t weak,” said Yan Long’zi before he glanced at Yue Weiwei.

“He never makes empty boasts. Since he said he can do it, he will.” Yue Weiwei smiled gently, but she never once spared Yan Long’zi a glance. Her attention was entirely focused on Lin Yun.

Yan Long’zi was enraged by this scene to the point that he even started cursing in his heart. He couldn’t figure out how a piece of garbage, who would have difficulty making it into the top ten, could compare to him. It was so bad that Yue Weiwei wasn’t even willing to spare him a glance.

All of the three kings and seven elites turned to look at Lin Yun, so one could imagine Lin Yun’s popularity right now. At this point, Lin Yun was a dazzling existence that no one could neglect.

“Lin Yun, do you now know why I’m looking forward to this battle?” Ye Qingfeng sneered, “Because you’re going to lose. You still have enough time to admit defeat right now. Otherwise, you’ll be thoroughly humiliated when I make my move.”

“Having a higher cultivation doesn’t mean anything. How much you can bring out from your cultivation is more important,” said Lin Yun as if he wasn’t bothered by Ye Qingfeng’s cultivation. Ye Qingfeng had clearly reached the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm recently, so it would be considered an achievement if he could unleash 80% of his cultivation. If his foundation wasn’t enough, then he wouldn’t even be able to unleash 80% of his cultivation.

On the other hand, true experts were different because they could unleash 120% of their cultivation or more. Furthermore, Lin Yun also has many trump cards. There was nothing for Lin Yun to be afraid of.

“Having a higher cultivation might not be impressive, but it’s enough as long as I can trample you!” Ye Qingfeng smiled. In his view, Lin Yun was using those words to comfort himself.

Forming a claw with both his hands, Ye Qingfeng charged towards Lin Yun, unleashing his powerful aura in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. At this moment, he moved like a demonic beast in front of Lin Yun in the blink of an eye. Then, he smacked his hands down like a mountain.

“Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slash!” Lin Yun held onto his sword and unleashed eighteen thunderbolts that overlapped together. This was only the first form of the Overlord Sword, but Lin Yun had brought it to the manifestation stage. Empowered by the Iris Sword Sutra, he could instantly unleash eighteen swords. The power from this attack was explosive and terrifying, so it sent Ye Qingfeng flying.

“Indigomoon Rising Sky!” Ye Qingfeng narrowed his eyes and spread his arms apart. He was shocked, but he still had to attack. A purple moon rose into the sky and his aura began to surge. As the purple moonlight shined down on him, multiple screens that looked like mirrors started forming. When he landed, he attacked Lin Yun with his claw.

“Seven Profound Steps—Golden Crow Wings!” Lin Yun flashed and left behind countless afterimages on the stage. His afterimages were shattered while he moved, so people mistakenly thought that he was torn into pieces by Ye Qingfeng numerous times.

Ye Qingfeng’s eyes flashed coldly and he pushed his movement technique to the limit. His speed was incredibly fast. If he was facing an ordinary opponent, he would’ve claimed his opponent’s life a long time ago.

“Kill!” Another claw flew over and tore two of Lin Yun’s afterimages into pieces. Even though Ye Qingfeng missed, he relentlessly pursued Lin Yun’s true body.

But Lin Yun merely leaned to the side and avoided the claw. Then, the Flower Burial Sword shot at Ye Qingfeng’s armpit with incredible speed. Ye Qingfeng immediately reacted as he quickly retreated. The two of them were so fast that it dazzled many people.

“My turn now,” said Lin Yun. When Ye Qingfeng saw Lin Yun’s gaze, he was alarmed because he could sense danger about to swallow him whole.

“Solar Slash!” Not giving Ye Qingfeng any time to think, Lin Yun stabbed his sword out while two light screens unfolded at his sides like a pair of wings.

Like an eagle soaring into the sky, Lin Yun quickly flew with his wings that distorted the air. By the time Ye Qingfeng managed to react, it was too late. All he could do was avoid suffering from a fatal attack. His defensive origin energy shattered and a stab wound appeared on his chest.

Damn it! Ye Qingfeng became enraged as the pain caused his face to distort. When he landed on the ground, he roared, “You want to defeat me? It won’t be that easy!”

The purple moon in the sky merged with him as he grew to an unbelievable height. With purple light shining around his body, he prepared another claw attack. As he moved forward, the purple light enveloping him became even brighter as he cried, “Threesolute Heart-shattering Palm!”

At this moment, Ye Qingfeng was like the colossal moon as all of his origin energy boiled. But Lin Yun had no reaction on his face as he looked at the sky, “Big Bang!”

His sword intent manifested into a lightning sphere that hovered in the sky like a bright star. At the same time, the lightning sphere continued to swell until Ye Qingfeng was a few dozen meters away from it.

This made everyone widen their eyes with disbelief because they couldn’t imagine how terrifying this attack was. The lightning radiated Lin Yun’s face and made him look extremely charming.

No! No! No! Ye Qingfeng’s pupils were filled with fear. He wanted to avoid this attack, but he could no longer stop his trajectory.

When Lin Yun’s sword landed on him, the lightning sphere also descended. With a huge explosion, Ye Qingfeng’s clothes were torn into pieces as he was sent flying back.

“Three swords...how is this possible?!” Ye Qingfeng looked at Lin Yun in fear because Lin Yun only used three swords to defeat him.

Three swords? Lin Yun shook his head inwardly. He actually didn’t need three swords, but he didn’t want to reveal too much of his strength. He held back with every attack to make sure his attacks would barely suppress Ye Qingfeng. Ye Qingfeng might be stronger than Feng Wudao, but that was the only thing he had.

Excluding Yu Haotian, everyone in the Inidigomoon Elysium’s party couldn’t help making a sour face. This was something they didn’t want to see. After all, Ye Qingfeng was defeated by three swords from Lin Yun despite having a higher cultivation. This meant that Lin Yun’s strength had exceeded their expectations.

With the heart of a swordsman, Lin Yun continued his undefeated legend.
