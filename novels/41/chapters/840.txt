Chapter 841 - Heaven Grade Martial Technique

“What’s this?” Lin Yun asked. The fragment was shining brightly like a star, containing ice-attributed spiritual energy. It seemed to be alive and flawless. With a flash, the fragment that was the size of a baby’s fist tried to escape.

Yue Weiwei wasn’t surprised and held it firmly before she turned to look at Lin Yun with a smile, “This is a fragment of the Divine Starjade Ice. This is even rarer than the Divine Radiantlight Stone in the bigger world. It’s an absolute treasure for ice attributes. You can use this to cultivate your sword sutra perfectly and it will benefit you in reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm.”

“So Nangong Wanyu and Fang Hanyu missed the actual treasure,” muttered Lin Yun, who received the fragment from Yue Weiwei.

“You’re luckier than them,” smiled Yue Weiwei.

Lin Yun merely smiled in response. He knew that it wasn’t his luck, but it was all thanks to Yue Wewei. “Let’s go.”

With the glittering beams soaring into the sky, the geniuses continued their way towards the highest mountains. There weren’t many towering mountains that reached the height of the clouds, but those held the highest quality treasures.

The phenomenon on each mountain was very different. One mountain was enveloped in lightning that would heavily injure anyone who approached it carelessly. Another mountain was calm and enveloped in clouds. Those who sat at the top of that mountain would gain deeper comprehension into their marital insight. Each mountain benefited and strengthened the cultivators in different ways.

This was a rather bizarre scene because the glittering beams didn’t solely come from the treasures. Lin Yun continued to travel with Yue Weiwei. His luck was pretty good because they found several fragments of the Divine Starjade Ice.

Simultaneously, his Azure Dragon Sword Aura had gotten stronger under various phenomena before it reached a bottleneck. Lin Yun knew that he had to comprehend wind and lightning intent if he wanted to make a breakthrough. It was a requirement he comprehended from Bai Lixuan’s sword technique.

But Lin Yun wasn’t the same as Bai Lixuan. Bai Lixuan used wind and lightning energies to mend his azure dragon, while Lin Yun uses the azure dragon to wield wind and lightning energies.

“That’s right.” Lin Yun sheathed his sword on a mountain enveloped in a gale. The depth of his eyes flashed like sharp swords that could pierce through the horizon. So far, he hadn’t run into any martial techniques. These martial techniques were divided into profound, spiritual, earth, and heaven grades.

Strictly speaking, the Overlord Sword could only be considered a top-tier earth grade martial technique. Even the Indigomoon Elysium only had incomplete versions of the Indigomoon Sutra and Heavenly Earth Overlord Art. If one of them was complete, the Indigomoon Elysium’s height would be comparable to Sword Sect in the past. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

According to Yue Weiwei, the martial techniques at the top of the mountains were all incomplete. Even if there were complete martial techniques, they were still inferior to the Overlord Sword. So the real harvest was at the last towering mountain, which could potentially contain a heaven grade martial technique. However, not even Yue Weiwei was sure if it was a complete technique.

“Is it that hard to obtain a heaven grade martial technique?” Lin Yun asked.

“Heaven grade martial techniques are also called fortune martial techniques. This means that obtaining one is a fortune. Fortune martial techniques are also divided into three grades, lesser, intermediate, and greater. A greater fortune martial technique is also divided into overlord, monarch, and emperor grades. Even in the world that I belong to, obtaining a top-tier ordinary fortune martial technique isn’t easy, not to mention greater fortune martial techniques,” explained Yue Weiwei.

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that. This was the first time he had heard of such an explanation. If that was the case, he didn’t know which level was the Iris Sword Sutra at.

Seeing through Lin Yun’s thoughts, Yue Weiwei smiled, “Big Brother Yun, your sword sutra can be considered a greater fortune martial technique, but it isn’t complete. Otherwise, it would be impossible for you to cultivate it with your current cultivation. Strictly speaking, you can consider it a lesser fortune martial technique.”

The Iris Sword Sutra isn’t complete? Lin Yun was surprised. Then again, it made sense because the Iris Sword Saint had hinted to him that he had to refine the sword box he was carrying to receive the Iris Sword Saint’s true legacy.

“What about the Dustlight Sword Art?” Lin Yun asked.

“That martial technique is very peculiar. It looks ordinary, but the intent contained in it is terrifyingly powerful. In your hands, it can be comparable to a complete lesser fortune martial technique. But in the hands of others, it might not even be able to compare to the Overlord Sword,” explained Yue Weiwei while holding her chin. Even she was having difficulty grading Dustlight Sword Art.

“Comparable to a lesser fortune martial technique?” Lin Yun was somewhat disappointed because it was his strongest sword technique.

“Hehe, don’t look down on a lesser fortune martial technique. No matter how ordinary it is, a complete one is a great fortune,” smiled Yue Weiwei.

Lin Yun didn’t know if what she said was real or fake. But Lin Yun knew that Yue Weiwei grasped many sword techniques and that her weakest one was comparable to the Overlord Sword.

“What’s that!” Right at this moment, everyone’s faces changed as they all looked in a direction. A flag had broken through the clouds of the highest mountain and descended down. There were hundreds of Divine Radiantlight Stone fragments around it, each glittering with different colors and elements.

Yue Weiwei was surprised before she calmed down, “That’s a peerless dao artifact, but it’s already damaged. The complete version must have dozens of Divine Radiantlight Stones engraved on it. If it’s refined with divine runes, it will be a powerful array. But the array seems to be damaged, so its dao is leaking out.”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he heard that because he could absorb the leaking dao. If he was lucky, he could comprehend martial intents with it or make a breakthrough with his martial intent. For example, Nangong Wanyu might be able to use this opportunity to make a breakthrough for his frost sword intent to reach the level of spiritual sword intent. Lin Yun finally understood why the Sacred Alliance’s judges were so excited at the appearance of the Dragoncloud Treasury.

This place was really mysterious. If one was lucky enough, they could undergo a transformation and reach an unprecedented height. Lin Yun glanced at Yue Weiwei. She was enveloped in mystery and there didn’t seem to be anything that she didn’t know about.

Yue Weiwei blushed and smiled, “Hehe, why are you looking at me? I know I’m pretty, but I’ll feel shy if you look at me like that. If you don’t go now, all the Divine Radiantlight Stone’s fragments will be snatched up. Without the fragments, it won’t be effective to absorb the dao.”

All of a sudden, Lin Yun plunged into a world of ice and couldn’t get back on his feet. But a second later, his eyes flashed with sword intent as collected himself. Looking at the playful smile on Yue Weiwei’s face, he instantly knew that he fell for her trick.

No longer daring to delay anymore, Lin Yun executed the Seven Profound Steps and ran through the air. Whenever he stepped on the air, he left behind a fluctuation of wind and lightning energy. From afar, he looked like an azure dragon that was manipulating the wind and lightning. However, he looked like a peerless sword at other times.

Watching Lin Yun leave, Yue Weiwei smiled and swiftly followed. Many geniuses were attracted by the phenomenon, but the weaker ones were torn into pieces on the spot. They weren’t killed, but they were transported out of the treasury. However, there was no way the other geniuses knew about that, so they slowed down and exercised caution.

Lin Yun swung his sword out and tore the phenomenon that was attacking him. The phenomenon attacking him could easily tear a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast apart, but it was destroyed by his sword ray.

Each phenomenon contained profound martial intent. To geniuses who didn’t grasp martial intent, it was practically impossible for them to travel safely. It didn’t take long for Lin Yun, Yu Haotian, Zhao Wuji, Nangong Wanyu, Mu Han, and the other top ten geniuses to arrive.

But when the flag landed, everyone felt pressure. At this moment, there were countless Divine Radiantlight Stone fragments, and each contained a boundless pressure. The pressure was accentuated by the dao leaking from the flag. Under this pressure, it wouldn’t be easy to obtain the fragments.

“Move out!” Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian exchanged a glance and moved out, reaching towards the Divine Radiantlight Stone fragments. As for Nangong Wanyu and the rest, they reacted a little slower.

Lin Yun, however, wasn’t in a hurry. He spread his spiritual sword intent out and started to search for his target among the fragments. He required fragments of wind and lightning attributes, so he could comprehend the wind and lightning intents.
