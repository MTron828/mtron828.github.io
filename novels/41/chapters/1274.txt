Chapter 1275 - Half an Inch of Sword Ray

“Lin Yun, it’s time for us to leave,” said Zhao Yan with a grave expression after stowing the three leaves.

“Don’t be in such a hurry. Let’s wait for them before going…” Lin Yun’s words left both Gongsun Yan and Zhao Yan shocked, with no idea what Lin Yun was trying to do. But Lin Yun merely smiled it off.

The two were fast and it wouldn’t take long for them to hide. Then again, hiding wasn’t a solution. So they might as well face them head-on, saving them a lot of trouble.

“Y-You killed so many big sect disciples. You’ll die if you don’t leave!” Gongsun Yan nervously said.

After all, Lin Yun didn’t have a prestigious background like Zhao Yan. The latter came from a saint clan with a saint in his clan. In the current era, saints were at the top of the pyramid and a saint could instantly make a clan into such a top-tiered force in the world that even powerful sects would have to give them face, not to mention big sects.

But Lin Yun was unfettered after hearing what Gongsun Yan said and stowed the treasures left behind by the eight geniuses of the big sects. When he picked up the saint sword from the Azure Thunder Sect, he locked his brows together. “The foundation of a big sect is this terrifying? Even a saint artifact is comparable to a monarch saint artifact. Isn’t this a little too terrifying?”

This was a hundred-rune saint artifact, with about three hundred saint runes engraved on it. Furthermore, it didn’t look special except for the wisp of azure thunder flame engraved on it, making it extraordinary.

Looking at this scene, Zhao Yan smiled. “It’s not the same. These can’t be considered genuine hundred-rune saint artifacts, and the monarch aura within them won’t last for long. This is the foundation of the big sects, like the Flame Dragon Sect, which keeps a flame jiao-dragon. Just a drop of blood from it can grant a remnant soul in a saint artifact. But that isn’t its blood essence, so it’s not the genuine dragon soul. Even so, it can produce a large number of monarch saint artifacts in a short period of time.”

But even if it wasn’t a genuine monarch artifact, it was still strong and they would be invincible if the other sects didn’t have the appropriate means to deal with it.

“For example, the Azure Thunder Sect has the azure moon, which can also empower the saint artifact. Aside from the jiao-dragon or azure moon, not only could they empower saint artifacts, but they could also allow one to greatly benefit if they have the corresponding secret technique.” Zhao Yan said with a grave expression. “If they didn’t have any trump cards, how would they be able to confront powerful sects? After all, powerful sects all have great saints within them.”

“Looks like I’ll have to kill that flame jiao-dragon and take the azure moon if there’s a chance, even if it’s an unimaginable fortune.” Lin Yun smiled.

Hearing his words, Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan’s lips twitched. At this moment, all the cultivators on the island were in deep shock, especially after watching how Lin Yun subdued the saint elixir. The last attack was even more shocking. Although they were far away and couldn’t see what Lin Yun did, they could sense the terrifying aura that had left them flabbergasted.

So many of them speculated that if Lin Yun allowed that power to wreak havoc, it might even tear the entire island apart.

“Why isn’t Lin Yun leaving after subduing the saint elixir? Doesn’t he know that the big sects’ elders are rushing over?”

“Is there any difference? He’ll only end up dead after being eyed by the elders of our sects.”

“That’s right. He’ll only die when the elders of my Azure Thunder Sect come!”

“Dragon Pulse Realm experts are terrifyingly strong. They can easily kill him with one finger. Later, when that brat dies, we’ll see if you guys can still laugh. Anyone who offends the Azure Thunder Sect will die regardless of who they are!” The big sect disciples were arrogant, and the appearance of a saint elixir naturally attracted the attention of their sects.

They believed that when their Dragon Pulse Realm elders arrived, Lin Yun would die no matter what. Although the other geniuses were unhappy, they couldn’t refute those words because what they said was right. There was the great saint origin in the Profound Wither Island, so the various sects not only dispatched their Dragon Pulse Realm experts, but they even secretly dispatched their Samsara Edict Realm experts. With the strength of a Dragon Pulse Realm expert, it was too easy to kill Lin Yun.

“Who dares to kill the disciple of my Myriad Beast Sect? My Myriad Beast Sect is here for the debt!” Just when everyone was uneasy, a ferocious roar resounded, containing a boundless killing aura that made the heavens and earth tremble.

Right at this moment, a group of experts enveloped in a killing aura appeared above the island. They were all glowing brightly, lighting up the darkness. Their ferocious roars made many people throw out mouthfuls of blood and lose their consciousness.

“The elders of my Myriad Beast Gate are here!” The Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples on the island rejoiced when they saw their elder there. After all, Lin Yun was incredibly strong and this made them full of grievances after seeing that they could only watch Lin Yun retrieve the saint elixir. Now, they could finally have their revenge.

“Who dares to kill the disciple of my Flame Phoenix Sect! My Flame Phoenix Sect is here for the debt!”

“My Silverblood Elysium is here for the debt!”

“My Flame Dragon Sect is here for the debt!”

“My Azure Thunder Sect is here for the debt!”

The eight sects were led by their Dragon pulse Realm elders, not to mention that they were only secondary compared to the powerful sects in the Ancient Barren Domain. Many people had never seen such a huge formation before, and this made the surrounding atmosphere boil.

Empyreans from various places could feel their feet becoming soft. They were startled by this scene and countless gazes were gathering at the summit of the snowy mountain. As the phenomenon caused by the saint elixir had disappeared, the deadly silence was a little terrifying.

At this moment, everyone felt that Lin Yun was doomed. After all, any one of the eight sects were colossal before Lin Yun, and with all eight sects gathered together, it would be hard for him not to die.

“Is there a need to be so exaggerating…?” Gongsun Yan’s face became pale while looking at this line-up. When he looked at Lin Yun, he wanted to see how he would react. But it was already too late for Gongsun Yan to be afraid now.

“Since you guys are here to collect the debts, then come at me altogether,” said Lin Yun without any fear at the summit of the snowy mountain. He was shining so brightly that he lit up the entire sky. He was like a lighthouse in the darkness announcing his presence.

“Tsk, tsk. A mere brat dares to be so arrogant?! Look at how I’ll take your life!” The Myriad Beast Gate’s elder’s laughter roared, before he flew out first. He was emitting the aura of a Dragon Pulse Realm expert, and his torrential aura surged out, making the surrounding space fluctuate. It felt as if the space would be torn apart under his pressure.

As for the elders of the other sects, they had no changes on their faces as they stepped forth, since the current situation was weird. After all, Lin Yun’s fearless action made them feel suspicious, but they didn’t say a single word.

“You’re not kneeling after seeing me?” The Myriad Beast Gate’s elder roared.

“Kneel? Why should I? Not to mention that you don’t have the qualification to make me kneel,” said Lin Yun without any fear in his eyes, showin disrespect while facing the Myriad Beast Gate’s elder. This made the Myriad Beast Gate’s elder stiff and wondered where this brat got his confidence from.

“Old Wolf, you’re not responding after being mocked by a brat?” The Azure Thunder Sect’s elder laughed.

“Why don’t you step down since you can’t even deal with a junior?” The Flame Dragon Sect’s elder added. This also made the elders of the other big sects echo along, mocking the Myriad Beast Gate’s elder.

This made the face of the Myriad Beast Gate’s elder change because he knew that they wanted to use him to probe Lin Yun. But he also didn’t have any path of retreat at this moment. In the end, he could only go along with them and roared, “You’re courting death!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He then pushed his palm towards Lin Yun, but he didn’t use his full strength behind this palm since he wanted to probe where Lin Yun was getting his confidence from.

This scene made Lin Yun’s face change with his back covered in cold sweat after sensing the threat. Seeing that Feng Jue still wasn’t appearing, this made Lin Yun feel that his senior brother was a little too unreliable.

“I suggest you take back your palm.” Right at that moment, an indolent voice resounded.

“Who is it?!” The elders of the various sects began to nervously look around, but their faces changed since they couldn’t find the person who spoke earlier.

This made the corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitch, but he also felt relieved at the same time. If his senior brother still didn’t come, then he might have to bring out the Firmament Battle Cloth.

“Who the hell are you?!” The Myriad Beast Gate’s elder looked around and unleashed his aura in the sixth pulse. In the next second, a terrifying dragon aura swept out and instantly enveloped the entire island, making everyone feel suffocating.

Many people couldn’t bear the pressure and fell to their knees. Right at this moment, the Flame Phoenix Sect’s elder said with a killing aura surging in his pupils, “You better not interfere in this matter. This person has to die today no matter what and no one can save him!”

After all, her disciple died in the hands of Lin Yun, so how could she allow Lin Yun to live?

“Where are you to hiding from? You don’t dare to face us?” The Flame Dragon Sect’s elder said with a jiao-dragon forming behind him. It was rare to see the eight of them joining hands together, but this also gave them the confidence to deal with whoever came.

The aura pressure released by the eight elders was terrifying, causing everyone to tremble in fear. All the Empyreans on the island were on their knees, and none of them dared to utter a single word.

“I’m afraid that my palm will land on him no matter what. If you still refuse to show yourself, then I can only crush this ant to death!” The Myriad Beast Gate’s elder said with a sinister face. He was naturally unhappy that he was threatened by the mysterious man.

“Go ahead, then.” That indolent voice resounded once more with disdain filling his voice.

“You’re courting death!” The Myriad Beast Gate’s elder became enraged and his palm flew toward Lin Yun. His energy even manifested into a wolf claw that was enveloped in a thunderstorm. When his wolf claw flew in mid-air, cracks began to appear on the island and the snowy mountain also began to crumble.

This scene made everyone’s hearts jolt because they knew that Lin Yun would be dead if this palm reached. But right at this moment, the wolf claw was torn into pieces before dissipating. At the same time, a person also appeared beside Lin Yun.

“Eight thousand years of fame and nine thousand years of sovereignty. Sword Sect’s Feng Jue is here.” That person revealed a cold smile with his right hand on his sword hilt.

“It’s you…” The big sect elders all had fear in their eyes when they saw Feng Jue. But just when they were about to speak, it was already too late. Feng Jue had already drawn his sword out by half an inch.

When sword rays flew out, all the phenomena summoned by the eight elders were torn to pieces. At the same time, eight heads flew into the sky. This scene left everyone dumbfounded.
