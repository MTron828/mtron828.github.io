Chapter 922 - Settled Down For Now

When Lin Yun held his sword, his temperament had undergone a drastic transformation. The surrounding purple swords that were trapping him began to tremble. It was like they were holding back a beast.

“It’s too late. Stop acting!” Shi Feng didn’t believe that Lin Yun could turn the tables around when he was also injured.

But when Shi Feng’s sword was about to descend, a brilliant sword ray suddenly tore apart all the surrounding sword rays.

“Who says that I don’t have a dao artifact?!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he flicked his wrist. The terrifying aura of a dao artifact was unleashed from the Flower Burial Sword and descended towards Shi Feng like a bright sun.

Shi Feng clearly had the advantage in the sky, but he looked like a tiny ant. Lin Yun seemed like a giant ever since he drew the Flower Burial Sword.

“Damn it!” Shi Feng’s face became pale as the sudden change caught him by surprise. He was confident that he could kill Lin Yun with his attack, but the tables were turned around the moment Lin Yun drew his sword.

Having no time to react, Shi Feng had to defend himself with his sword rays. Naturally, there was no way he could take Lin Yun’s attack head-on and his sword rays crumbled. At this moment, the Flower Burial that had endured for a long time was finally able to reveal its fangs. It devoured Shi Fang with a single sword ray.

“NO!” Everyone could hear a miserable scream as the sword ray enveloped Shi Feng and tore him to pieces. After killing Shi Feng, Lin Yun’s sword hummed through the heavens and earth.

“What…” Mo Han was completely dumbfounded by this scene. Lin Yun didn’t use any trick, just a single sword. Lin Yun’s sword was faster than anyone could have imagined and instantly took Shi Feng’s life.

When Mo Han saw this scene, he knew he had to run. Without hesitation, he turned and started running for his life. When he landed on the ground, he quickly put his dao artifact away and formed seals with his hands. Afterwards, he spit up a mouthful of blood and split into 18 different afterimages that ran in different directions.

Everything happened so quickly that no one was able to react. Clearly, Mo Han paid a great price to use a secret technique of the Blackflame Realm.

“You want to leave? It’s not that easy!” Lin Yun wasn’t satisfied with only killing Shi Feng. He flicked his wrist and unleashed ten sword rays that pierced through 16 of Mo Han’s afterimages.

Only two afterimages remained who spit up a mouthful of blood as their eyes became dim. Lin Yun frowned because the aura from the two afterimages were identical. He couldn’t differentiate between them.

The simple solution was to kill both, so Lin Yun casually swung his sword once more. If Mo Han was unlucky, he would die. If he was lucky, he would survive, but he would be in critical condition.

Quietly, the spectators fixed their eyes on Lin Yun. No one could utter a word at what just happened.

Lin Yun flipped the situation on its head the moment he drew his sword. Furthermore, half an inch of his sword was enough to shatter the dao artifact aura coming from Shi Feng’s weapon. When Lin Yun fully drew his sword, Shi Feng was torn into pieces before he had a chance to react.

He couldn’t even put up a fight against Lin Yun, which meant that he was nothing without his dao artifact. How could Shi Feng compare to Lin Yun?

The higher realm geniuses felt conflicted because of Shi Feng. Those who weren’t in the Azure Dragon Ranking were nothing before Lin Yun. They couldn’t help but wonder what would happen when Lin Yun made a breakthrough in his cultivation.

No one could believe that Shi Feng was killed. Even Mo Han who managed to escape wasn’t in a good condition. He was on the brink of destruction despite executing a secret technique that destroyed his foundation.

With that, four geniuses who could have entered the Azure Dragon Ranking had become a laughingstock. Everyone knew that this matter would cause a huge uproar in the Azure Dragon Region. When that happened, the higher realms would hunt Lin Yun down.

After all, Lin Yun arrogantly killed everyone that belonged to the higher realms. His actions were equivalent to crushing the pride of each higher realm.

However, Lin Yun wasn’t concerned with all the looks he was getting. Instead, he examined the Flower Burial Sword and the profound floral runes that were engraved on it. Ordinary lower dao artifacts were engraved with ordinary saint runes. However, the floral runes on Flower Burial were extremely complicated. They could even captivate his soul if he looked at them for too long.

But there were also some parts of the runes that were dim, signaling the Flower Burial Sword hadn’t reached its potential.

“The current Flower Burial should be between an intermediate and lower dao artifact. It might even be more terrifying than that…” muttered Lin Yun with a grave expression. “I won’t disappoint you in this lifetime.”

The sword gently hummed in response to Lin Yun. The Flower Burial Sword was basically an extension of his life. After all, it had shared many life and death battles with Lin Yun. Sheathing the sword, Lin Yun turned around and saw Lil’ Red dashing over with Shi Feng’s interspatial pouch and dao artifact.

“You finally appeared,” sighed Lin Yun with a smile. Lin Yun was relieved that Lil’ Red successfully digested the Millennium Flower. With the Glorysun Spirit in hand, Lin Yun knew that the peace he was enjoying was temporary. He really couldn’t stay any longer.

After Lil’ Red hopped on his shoulder, Lin Yun looked at Chen Xuan’s group among the crowd and transmitted his voice before leaving.

An hour later, Chen Xuan and the group gathered around Lin Yun with unconcealable shock on their faces. Out of the four geniuses, three died and one ran away. The result was so shocking that they couldn’t believe it even though they witnessed everything. Although they traveled with Lin Yun to Flamefeather City, they had no idea he was so terrifying.

They knew that it wouldn’t take long for Lin Yun’s name to spread in the Heavenly Path like wildfire.

“Lin Yun, you’re in trouble now. No one can survive after offending the higher realms, not to mention you offended three higher realms at the same time. The Bloodbone Realm will be extremely troublesome for you because they have a deep foundation in the Heavenly Path,” sighed Chen Xuan with a grave expression.

“Killing one and killing three makes no difference. Furthermore, these people treat us like ants so they’ll think that I’m a pushover regardless if I kill them or not,” smiled Lin Yun calmly.

The group was stunned by Lin Yun’s words. Since the higher realms viewed them as ants, why would the higher realms worry about killing them?

Lin Yun showed the group that he only respected those who respected him. The Heavenly Path was a place where the strong preyed on the weak, so he would speak with his strength and get his respect.

“What are you going to do now?” asked Chen Xuan.

“I plan on leaving and making a breakthrough before I enter the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm,” said Lin Yun. In addition to going through his tribulation, Lin Yun also had two advanced fortune martial techniques that he could practice. The Ten Profound Steps was an imperial fortune martial technique that required him to be in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. However, he could start cultivating the Divine Glorysun Fist whenever he wanted to.

If he was successful, he could confidently deal with the pursuit from the higher realms. Thinking about his harvest in Flamefeather City, Lin Yun knew that his strength would soar. He couldn’t begin to imagine how powerful he would be after reaching the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

At that time, he might even be able to fend off his pursuers and compete with them!

“I’ll have to trouble you with my friends in the Thunderflame City,” said Lin Yun while cupping his hands together.

“Don’t worry about it. I’ll handle it personally since you saved my life.” Chen Xuan nodded his head since he had to inform them that Lin Yun was facing the pursuit of the higher realms. Then, he gave Lin Yun a map of the Azure Dragon Region.

“I’m not sure about the Nethercloud Realm, but the Bloodbone Realm probably has a method to trace you. They’re demonic cultivators, so Feng Wuji might have left a mark on you,” said Chen Xuan with a grave expression.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Looks like I’ll have to pay close attention to that,” replied Lin Yun. However, he wasn’t too worried because he knew that he would run into them sooner or later. Others might fear the higher realms in the Heavenly Path, but he wouldn’t. As a swordsman, why would he be afraid of a fight?
