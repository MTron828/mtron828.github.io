Chapter 916 - Dao Artifact’s Might

Dao artifacts required precious materials, but they were also engraved with fifth grade spiritual runes from a saint spiritualist. Spiritual runes that were fifth grade and higher were known as saint runes. The saint runes were also divided into greater, intermediate, and lesser categories.

Even the most ordinary lesser saint rune was rare because saint spiritualists didn’t usually grasp more than three lesser saint runes. As for greater and intermediate saint runes, they were only found in powerful sects and clans with a long history.

It was even rumored that greater saint runes weren’t any weaker than divine runes. However, this was on the basis that most divine runes were incomplete. Complete divine runes were basically nonexistent. Lin Yun couldn’t even imagine one since he only met fourth grade spiritualists in the Profound Amber Realm.

The grades of saint runes determined the power and grade of the dao artifacts. With the rarity of saint runes, there weren’t many dao artifacts.

To most people, dao artifacts were a pipe dream. But Lin Yun’s Flower Burial Sword wasn’t the same. Flower Burial had a high grade and would grow with enough rare flowers. Sooner or later, the nourishment would allow the saint runes to appear.

So when Lin Yun observed the runes that were combining on his sword, he was full of excitement.

“After slaying three people, Flower Burial has clearly grown stronger. It’s only a step away from reaching the might of a dao artifact.” Lin Yun suddenly wanted to give the Flower Burial Sword a try and circulated both his sword sutras. When he poured his origin energy into the sword, Lin Yun could hear a brilliant hum. Instantly, sword rays shot out of Flower Burial as it released an immense sword aura.

“Go!” Then, the sword rays combined and pierced the wall. Under the sword ray, a huge and crude hole was left on the wall.

“That was just a casual attack from me. If I empower it with my sword intent, I might be able to tear the barrier apart.” Lin Yun sheathed his sword as the anticipation in his eyes became dense. He knew that he still had to wait for Flower Burial to become a dao artifact.

“I should’ve caught up to the geniuses from the higher realms. I wonder if the trial has come to an end…” Lin Yun placed the Flower Burial Sword back into the sword box before he continued his journey.

The space in the barrier was extremely mysterious and was basically its own world. So he had no idea where to find the Glorysun Spirit or if there were any dangers he needed to be wary of. Then, Lin Yun entered a door and found himself in a secluded secret chamber.

On the outside, many people were gathered to watch the shrinking barrier. Even the geniuses from the higher realms were kicked out and forced to watch the show.

“There’s only a few people left.”

“There’s something weird about this barrier. It’s too difficult to press on. Only those right below the Azure Dragon Ranking have a chance.”

“No, Lin Yun is still inside.” When someone said that, the surrounding atmosphere suddenly became quiet. They recalled Mo Han, Chen An, and Shi Feng’s words to Lin Yun after he killed Feng Wuji. They also remembered that Lin Yun didn’t care.

“Is he planning to face three geniuses from the higher realms?” Xian Yunzhen started feeling anxious when he realized that Lin Yun was still inside.

Even Chen Xuan, Liu Yun, and the others were feeling nervous. After all, Lin Yun had revealed his trump card when Mo Han, Chen An, and Shi Feng had concealed theirs. Plus, all three of them owned dao artifacts. It would be dangerous for Lin Yun if he encountered them.

Ultimately, Lin Yun’s cultivation was too low. After all, he hadn’t gone through his tribulation.

At this moment, Mo Han, Shi Feng, and Chen An passed the last test.

“The birth of the Glorysun Spirit is accompanied by a lot of treasures,” said Shi Feng as he stepped into the chamber. As he looked around, he spotted a golden fruit at the center of the chamber. His eyes blazed because it was a Dragonflame Fruit that contained pure fire spiritual energy. The fruit even leaked spiritual energy that formed an outline of a flame dragon. There was no doubt that the value of this fruit was a lot higher than the Blood Sun Fruit that Liu Yun took from Feng Wuji.

“Hmmm, it looks troublesome,” smiled Shi Feng. He was experienced and wasn’t in a hurry to take the fruit.

Simultaneously, Mo Han and Chen An also stepped into different chambers with treasures. The chambers they were in weren’t far from the Glorysun Spirit, so they would eventually bump into each other.

“A fortune martial technique?” Unlike the others who found treasures in their chambers, Lin Yun found a jade slip emitting golden radiance. By the dense fire energy around the jade slip, he could tell that it wasn’t ordinary.

“Could it be an advanced fortune martial technique?” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered. Advanced fortune martial techniques were divided into overlord, imperial, and monarch categories. Lin Yun had already obtained an imperial fortune martial technique, but it was just a movement technique.

In the Heavenly Path, ordinary greater fortune martial techniques were rare, not to mention advanced fortune marital techniques. If it was an advanced fortune martial technique, then Lin Yun couldn’t imagine its value. His Three Heavenly Divides could compete with geniuses from the higher realms and far exceeded his fist technique and movement technique. However, it was still lacking compared to those geniuses.

When Lin Yun took a step forward, his sword intent started humming within his body to give him a warning. An array appeared on the wall as beams of fire shot out and intertwined in the air.

Although Lin Yun quickly retreated, he was still caught by the beam. It instantly incinerated his sword intent and tore through his origin energy and sleeves. Fortunately, he was on high alert or else he would’ve been pierced by the beam.

“I guess anyone that gets within ten meters of the jade slip will be attacked. I have to observe the regulation of the arrays on the wall. Otherwise, I’ll have to rely on my movement technique or physique…” Lin Yun shook his head because neither solution was great.

He was confident that he could block the beams if he pushed his spiritual sword intent to the limit, but that would be exhausting.

In the end, Lin Yun decided to circle the jade slip and observe it for any openings. Occasionally, he would reach out to test the array. After half an hour of doing this, he started to understand the array better. The array wasn’t limited to the engravings on the wall, but also corresponded with the ground. So he needed to find a way to avoid the arrays on the wall to prevent an even worse situation.

Lin Yun calmed down and tried to find the solution. Just as he was about to find a safe path, the door to the chamber was suddenly opened by Chen An.

Chen An was shocked to see Lin Yun. He was surprised because competing for the Glorysun Spirit wasn’t beneficial to Lin Yun. If Lin Yun didn’t have a strong background, obtaining the Glorysun Spirit would bring him trouble.

“You really aren’t afraid of death. You’ve already offended the Bloodbone Realm, yet you still want to compete for the Glorysun Spirit?” Chen An sneered as he tightly grabbed onto his whip in his right sleeve. He had learned from Feng Wuji’s death and immediately brought out his dao artifact. This way, he wouldn’t be restricted by Lin Yun’s sword aura.

“This has nothing to do with you,” said Lin Yun as his gaze fell onto Chen An’s whip.

“Get lost. This jade slip belongs to me now. An advanced fortune martial technique is rare even in the Nethercloud Realm.” Chen An’s eyes flashed with greed and sneered, “I’ve already taken out my dao artifact, so you won’t have a chance to get rid of me!”

Lin Yun hadn’t experienced the power of a dao artifact, but he could imagine how terrifying it was. It would be even scarier in the hands of a geniuses from a higher realm. As long as Chen An brought out 70% of his weapon’s power, he would remain undefeated throughout Flamefeather City. However, Chen An was too naive to think that a dao artifact could deter Lin Yun.

“Even if I don’t use my sword, you’re no match for me. Are you that confident that I can’t draw my sword if you’re holding your dao artifact?” asked Lin Yun.

When Chen An heard that, his face sank. “It looks like you’re determined to compete against me. Very well, you can die now!”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The whip in Chen An’s hand exploded with crimson radiance as the sound of a snake’s hiss echoed throughout the chamber.
