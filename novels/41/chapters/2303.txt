Chapter 2304 - A Little Arrogant

“Why did you run so fast? I still wanted some Mandala Fragrance from you,” Lil’ Purple said.

Hearing what Lil’ Purple said, the Othershore Flower ran even faster, bringing a smile to Lin Yun’s face.

“Hmph, why are you smiling?” Lil’ Purple said, “This place is filled with divine dragon saint liquid. Since it's cultivated here, its roots can reach a few thousand meters. It has absorbed at least half of the divine dragon saint liquid.”

Lin Yun smiled, patting Lil’ Purple’s head, “You only care about the Phoenix Tree. Don’t forget that the Othershore Flower is also young.”

“I won’t hold it against you since you’ve given your word. But… it’s time for us to go out.” Lil’ Purple immediately tossed it to the back of her mind, thinking about the Sinful Fire Divine Rune.

“Alright, you can lead the way.” Lin Yun left the Iris Secret Realm and carried the Iris Sword Box on his back, letting Lil’ Purple point in his direction.

“Lin Yun, why don’t you wear a mask?” Lil’ Purple said.

“There’s no need.” Lin Yun decided against it after suffering from it once. If he wore a mask, he might be considered an intruder if someone found him. But if he didn’t wear a mask, they probably wouldn’t do anything to him even if someone saw him.

When leaving the Stream Cloud Residence, the sky was dark. Lin Yun followed Lil' Purple’s lead and visited various floating islands while searching for the Sinful Fire Divine Rune’s aura.

“Not here…”

“Not here, either…”

“It looks like it’s not on the floating islands.”

“Let’s go down, then.”

Lin Yun appeared on the plaza after visiting all the floating islands. This was a spacious ground with white jade used as tiles on the ground and a gorgeous statue at the center.

“This statue is really beautiful.” Lin Yun raised his head and discovered the status was white and flawless. Even at night, the statue gave off a peerless beauty.

“Stop looking at it. The Sinful Fire Divine Rune is on the mountain,” Lil’ Purple said.

Divine Phoenix Mountain was the name of a holy land in the outside world, but it was only a mountain here. The Phoenix’s lineage worshipped the mountain as a sacred mountain.

The Astral River Saint Sovereign said that he could go anywhere, and didn’t say Lin Yun couldn’t climb this mountain.

“Don’t cower. I’ll cover for you if anything happens,” Lil’ Purple urged.

Lin Yun smiled and climbed the mountain. He had no intention of stealing the Sinful Fire Divine Rune. He just wanted to confirm if it was here, so it shouldn’t be a big issue.

The divine mountain was strictly guarded with several layers of spiritual arrays. When Lin Yun got close to it, he could sense a terrifying pressure. He knew it was nearly impossible for even an Emperor to intrude on this mountain.

Lin Yun’s eyes shone with golden radiance in the night as he circulated his Divine Light Sword Intent. He could see spiritual arrays and people heavily guarding this place.

When the Divine Light Sword Intent dissipated, Lin Yun inwardly muttered and felt that there was something weird about this place. There weren’t many Saints here, not even a Saint Sovereign or a Great Saint.

Since that was the case, Lin Yun no longer had any reservations and passed through the spiritual arrays. Occasionally, someone would sense him, but they didn’t do anything after glancing at him.

“At the waist of the mountain,” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded.

Lin Yun didn’t hesitate and headed in the direction that Lil’ Purple pointed out, coming to a temple. This temple was meant to worship the phoenix, and there wasn’t a roof here. The temple was covered in flaming patterns with various gorgeous statues, a different style than the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“In there.” Lin Yun landed on an ancient path with erected stone pillars on the side. The far end was an altar with ashes that would flicker with flames.

“Those are the ashes that are left behind after a phoenix undergoes rebirth. The Sinful Fire Divine Rune is inside,” Lil’ Purple said excitedly.

Lin Yun calmed down and looked around. He asked, “Why isn’t this place guarded? The Sinful Fire Divine Rune is placed just like that?”

“That’s because you’re a noble guest of the Divine Phoenix Mountain and can visit any forbidden ground you want,” a voice resounded. A young man came down from the stage, donning a white robe that was decorated with golden threads and wearing a crown. This person was the holy master of Divine Phoenix Mountain.

All of the Saints on Divine Phoenix Mountain discovered Lin Yun’s presence the moment he stepped in, including the holy master. But the holy master stopped them and decided to visit Lin Yun in person.

Lin Yun squinted and was surprised because this person shared an uncanny resemblance with Ji Zixi. He asked, “You’re Ji Zixi’s elder brother?”

The holy master initially wanted to disclose his identity, but smiled, “I do have some relation with her. You can call me Scarlet Radiant… Saint Lord.”

Lin Yun nodded and wasn’t surprised. He had already noticed that something wasn’t right.

“I saw you going around the floating islands and visiting several places. It turns out you’re after the Sinful Fire Divine Rune,” the holy master smiled.

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled upon hearing that. He realized that his actions were completely visible. He felt fortunate that he didn’t wear a mask.

As for Lil’ Purple, who promised to cover for him, she became silent within the Iris Secret Realm.

“Flower Burial Sword Saint, no need to be so courteous,” the holy master smiled. “The master already said you can go anywhere in the Divine Phoenix Mountain.”

Lin Yun smiled, cupping his fists together, “You can just call me Lin Yun. No need to call me a Sword Saint.”

“I’ll call you Brother Lin, then. It sounds more intimate this way,” the holy master smiled and allowed Lin Yun to take a closer look at the Sinful Fire Divine Rune. Flames were flickering in the ashes on the stage, making it seem as though the ashes were alive.

“Was there really a phoenix who underwent rebirth here before?” Lin Yun asked.

The holy master replied, “That’s right. Strictly speaking, the entire Ji Clan on Divine Phoenix Mountain is the bloodline clan of that Phoenix Lord. That lord also gave us the phoenix bloodline, including our inheritance. We’re only followers and protectors.”

“This Phoenix Lord you’re talking about is the Heavenly Slaughter Empress?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right,” the holy master replied.

Lin Yun had huge waves sweeping within his heart when he heard that and his face changed. On the contrary, Lil’ Purple was calm within the Iris Secret Realm.

“But it shouldn’t be the same person you ran into,” the holy master replied.

“What do you mean by that?” Lin Yun asked.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“That lord gave up all hope after the ancient battle and accidentally committed a big mistake, causing a massacre. With no choice, the Iris Sword Saint, who slew a deity in the Saint Realm, had no choice but to seal her physique, and it had been over a hundred thousand years since then,” the holy master sighed.

Lin Yun was stunned because he didn’t expect that part to actually be real.

“Brother Lin, what’s the matter?” The holy master asked.

Lin Yun squeezed out a smile, “Nothing much.”

The holy master didn’t ask further and changed the topic, “Big Brother Lin, you’re interested in the Sinful Fire Divine Rune?”

Lin Yun nodded upon hearing that.

The holy master sighed, “This is a problem. Logically speaking, we won’t hesitate to give you any treasures you desire based on the divine flame fragment alone, but even the holy master can’t decide about the fate of the Sinful Fire Divine Rune.”

“This is more precious than the divine flame fragment, so I won’t ask the Divine Phoenix Mountain to give it to me,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Do you want to take a look at it?” The holy master asked.

Lin Yun’s thoughts were a little chaotic, but he casually replied, “I guess so.”

“How about this? Let’s have a spar between us. If you can defeat me, I can let you borrow the Sinful Fire Divine Rune for a period,” the holy master smiled.

“This… isn’t this improper?” Lin Yun asked in shock.

“I believe that the holy master won’t be that petty,” the holy master smiled.

“Can I borrow it out of the Divine Phoenix Mountain?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Well, that can be considered,” the holy master laughed.

Lin Yun was stumped when he heard that, thinking that the Divine Phoenix Mountain was a little too generous.

“I’m a fourth-stage Saint Lord, so I won’t be taking advantage of you if I fight you, right?” The holy master smiled.

Those words sounded weird to Lin Yun, but he smiled, “Naturally not. Truthfully speaking, there won’t be more than ten people who can take my sword beneath the sixth-stage Saint Lord in the Kunlun Realm with my current strength.”

Lin Yun wasn’t exaggerating in his words because he felt that no one beneath the sixth-stage Saint Lord could take an all-out attack from him. So, he was already being humble with what he said.

The holy master smiled, “They all say that Flower Burial is arrogant, and I have experienced it today. How about this: I can let you borrow the Sinful Fire Divine Rune for half a year if you can take ten moves from me.”

Lin Yun was stumped when he heard that and further verified from the other party’s aura that he was only a Saint Lord. He wasn’t afraid, even if a Saint Sovereign suppressed their cultivation. If a Great Saint suppressed his cultivation, Lin Yun was confident about exchanging a few hundred moves. This was how the four Great Saints trained him back on Blood Purgatory Mountain. So Lin Yun was already used to increasing the difficulty for himself.

“Haha! What arrogance. Lin Yun, go and teach him a lesson. This person must be a few hundred years old and sealed his cultivation, pretending to be tender,” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded.

Lin Yun had much to ask Lil’ Purple, but he knew it wasn’t time for that. He asked, “Can you really make the decision?”

“Didn’t you say I look like Ji Zixi’s elder brother? You might have guessed wrongly, but I’m related to her. Furthermore, everyone on Divine Phoenix Mountain can trust your character,” the holy master smiled.

“Okay.” Lin Yun no longer wasted his saliva and brought out his Divine Light Sword Intent. His hair began to flutter violently, with his sword ray shining brightly. When he drew the sword, he performed the Heaven Sword Form, catching the holy master by surprise, who discovered that he was restricted and couldn’t move.

When the holy master raised his head, his sight was filled with sword rays, and he couldn’t see Lin Yun anywhere. But the holy master didn’t panic and his sleeves flew out, “An impressive sword technique!”

His sleeves were like a phoenix’s wings surging with flames, shattering the thirty-six layers of heaven as they came crashing down.

Lin Yun felt that his sword had taken a heavy blow and retreated. When he landed on the ground, a force still made him take a few steps back.

The holy master smiled, “Flower Burial, I have blocked your sword. I wonder where I am ranked in the world?”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched as he laughed. This was interesting because this person was even more arrogant than him. Lin Yun forgot about the Sinful Fire Divine Rune for the time being, with his fighting spirit blazing.
