Chapter 278 - Clearing the Haze

The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s atmosphere was like the calm before the storm. The places that were usually filled with people barely had anyone nowadays. There was even a dangerous aura spreading out in the sect. Rumors of how different this Alliance-Union Battle would be had spread around.

Another ten days had passed, meaning that the Alliance-Union Battle was only twenty days away. A youth stood on a long peak in the Locket Mountain with his brows locked. Lin Yun sighed, “I failed again…”

He spent the last ten days comprehending the Overlord Sword, but he failed to make any progress. On the contrary, he found himself trapped deep in the fog. He even started to suspect that he made a mistake right from the start.

After all, how would a sword technique only have one sword? If there was only one sword, how was he going to change his movement? And if he couldn’t change his move, how was he going to reach greater mastery in it?

These factors proved to be a dilemma for him. He had practiced the Overlord Sword for six months, but he barely made any progress in it. Even if the Overlord Sword’s might had increased, it was only because of the breakthrough he made in his cultivation technique. Meaning, he had no changes to the Overlord Sword.

Right at this moment, a figure shot out from the clouds and landed on the cliff. She was basking in the sun, which defined her graceful figure even further. It was Xin Yan. She paid Lin Yun a visit five days ago, but she didn’t disturb Lin Yun when she saw that he was practicing the Overlord Sword.

“You failed again?” asked Xin Yan when she noticed Lin Yun’s expression.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun nodded at her with a bitter smile. “It feels like I caught onto something, but at the same time, I didn’t. I’ve never encountered such a difficult martial technique.”

Lin Yun tried many different things over the past ten days, but he ultimately failed to make any progress. On the other hand, his sword art had improved. He was even more adept with the Flower Burial Sword now, which was a source of comfort to him right now. Otherwise, he would’ve spent the last ten days doing nothing.

Xin Yan smiled like a blooming rose, “Junior Brother, have you ever wondered why the Overlord Sword is a forbidden technique?”

“Of course I did. Those who practiced this sword technique all went amok in the end and suffered from the backlash. Many people were wounded by this sword technique over the past hundred years, which is why it’s called a forbidden technique.”

“I don’t think that’s the case,” replied Xin Yan.

“Oh?” Surprise flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes. He asked, “Senior Sister, what do you mean?”

“Perhaps it’s not because your comprehension is lacking, but because the sword technique is lacking. Guardian Plum told you that there’s only one sword, but that might not be the case. Perhaps even Guardian Plum hasn’t reached greater mastery with it,” said Xin Yan.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he replied, “That seems possible… Since no one had managed to practice it over the past hundred years, that means that even Guardian Plum might not have learned it.”

The haze shrouding Lin Yun’s heart faded when he heard what Xin Yan said and his mood also improved.

Xin Yan was relieved when she saw that Lin Yun was no longer in a dilemma. She didn’t tell Lin Yun about the black mist shrouding his forehead when she saw him earlier. It was a sign that Lin Yun was running amok. He would be in danger if he wasn’t careful.

But fortunately, Lin Yun was smart and unlocked the knot in his heart from her words. She was afraid that Lin Yun would panic if she told him that he was on the brink of running amok. With that, Lin Yun’s perilous situation was resolved without him even knowing.

Many people injured themselves to practice this sword. After all, forbidden techniques were forbidden for a reason.

“The Alliance-Union Battle’s location has been finalized.” Xin Yan sighed, “It’s located at a place that none of us have expected. I was planning to tell you about it five days ago.”

“Where is it?” asked Lin Yun.

“The Burial Sword Peak!” she responded.

Lin Yun naturally knew about that place. It was one of the four treasured lands in the Sword Firmament Pavilion and it was rarely opened to the public. The threshold to enter was high and only those with Sword Firmament Tokens in the fourth grade could enter.

When every senior passes away in the Sword Firmament Pavilion, their personal sword would be buried in the peak. The entire Burial Sword Peak was shrouded in a haze, causing it to seem eerie. This was the most mysterious land out of the four great lands. No one had expected that the Alliance-Union Battle would be held here.

“There’s a huge reward for this Alliance-Union Battle. Anyone who can get into the top hundred will obtain the qualification to enter the Earth Ranking. Those in the top ten will be rewarded with eight hundred second-grade spiritual jades and those in the top three will be rewarded with a third-grade pellet. As for the champion, he or she will be rewarded with a cosmic treasure!”

Xin Yan’s words shocked Lin Yun. He then smiled awkwardly, “The reward is really tempting. There has never been such an excellent reward in the past, right?”

Lin Yun was shocked that the sect would reward a cosmic treasure. Even a cosmic treasure of the lowest quality was tempting to all the participants. Furthermore, those in the top ten could receive the qualification to enter the Earth Ranking.

This was tempting to every single outer disciple. After all, they could pick a spiritual cultivation technique once they were in the Earth Ranking. This would greatly boost their strength. Then again, the fact that the Alliance-Union Battle would be held in the Burial Sword Peak was shocking. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

After all, who wasn’t curious about the Burial Sword Peak? Not to mention that the rewards could raise a huge wave in the outer sect.

In the past, there were many who didn’t join the Alliance-Union Battle because they were afraid of death. But it was uncertain this time around since many of the hidden experts might be tempted by the rewards. There was no doubt that this Alliance-Union Battle would be the best in the past hundred years.

“What’s the matter? Are you tempted by the cosmic treasure?” Xin Yan looked at Lin Yun with narrowed eyes.

Her voice was so gentle that it made Lin Yun’s bone go soft. Inwardly, he bitterly smiled and then he nodded his head, “Of course. We’re talking about a cosmic treasure.”

“But you need to be alive to claim it.” The smile disappeared from Xin Yan’s face as she continued, “Junior Brother, I have no idea how you killed Xue Feng, but I have to tell you that there are at least three in the top ten on the Mortal Ranking that can easily kill Xue Feng. The only difficulty is that those wandering cultivators are cunning, so they will flee immediately if they can’t win.

“This is a reason why there aren’t many disciples who accomplished a feat like yours. Killing Xue Feng doesn’t mean that you will be safe in the outer sect. After all, none of those in the top three are pushovers.”

Lin Yun nodded his head gravely.

“Alright, it’s good that you know that. Now, don’t think too much about it because I’m just warning you. I’ll be sad if you die. After all, where will I find such an obedient junior brother?” The solemn look on Xin Yan’s face disappeared and was replaced with a blooming smile as she knocked on Lin Yun’s head.

Lin Yun rubbed his head from the pain and smiled. He also found himself fortunate that he could meet someone like Xin Yan in the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

Seeing Lin Yun in pain, Xin Yan smiled, “There are still twenty days. Don’t force it since you can’t make any progress in the Overlord Sword. Why don’t you train your cultivation technique and sword aura? After all, the Alliance-Union Battle will be held in the Burial Sword Peak.”

Lin Yun nodded his head. The Alliance-Union Battle would take place soon and it would be a gamble to spend the remaining time on the Overlord Sword. He might as well try and convert his resources into his cultivation in the Iris Sword Sutra before concluding trying to improve everything else.

“I’m leaving now.” Xin Yan smiled and vanished like the wind, leaving behind only a faint aroma.

Lin Yun let out a breath as all the haze bothering him the last few days cleared up. He raised his head to look at the clouds. What Xin Yan said was right. None of those in the top three on the Mortal Ranking were pushovers, so he couldn’t afford to underestimate them.

But Lin Yun wouldn’t mind giving them a surprise if they felt that Lin Yun was only lucky to kill Xue Feng. “Top three on the Mortal Ranking… I’m looking forward to what kind of surprise you guys can give me!”

Lin Yun smiled as he looked at the bright sun.
