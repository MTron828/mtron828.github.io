Chapter 2444 - Sword Sect Never Dies!

The Light Subduing Great Saint was shocked. Lin Yun’s strength and attainment in Yin-Yang Dao shocked him. He only came in contact with it two hundred years ago, one hundred years to grasp it, and one hundred years to reach his current level.

He spent two hundred years, but the Light Subduing Great Saint didn’t feel that it was long. On the contrary, he was excited and proud of his achievement because an Eternal Dao was too powerful. Before grasping an Eternal Dao, his strength was comparable to the sect masters of the other holy lands, but now he was only comparable to the Heavenly Sever Great Saint.

On the other hand, Lin Yun was only twenty-eight at most, and yet he had already grasped the Yin-Yang Dao, reaching an even higher attainment than him. Lin Yun’s comprehension of Yin-Yang Dao was on a level higher than his own.

Light Subduing Great Saint's face was pale when he looked at Lin Yun. He didn’t react much when Su Ziyao grasped Truth Dao because he didn’t grasp it nor had the time to comprehend it. But Yin-Yang Dao was an entirely different story because he made countless efforts to reach his current level.

The Light Subduing Great Saint looked at Lin Yun, gritting his teeth, “The world isn’t fair. You've only cultivated for ten-odd years! Why can you catch up to my three hundred years of comprehension?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Lin Yun’s gaze turned cold, and he furiously roared, “You have the cheeks to talk about fairness? When Yu Qingfeng wiped out two peaks of the Sword Sect and suppressed my master for three thousand years, why didn’t you say it was unfair? The Sword Sect is only a top-tiered sect, and the three of your holy lands are here to gang up on us. Why didn’t you say that it wasn’t fair? The world isn’t fair?

“I’m twenty-eight, but the pressure I bear is unimaginable. Have you ever wondered what I’m facing? Ten-odd years of cultivation with countless life and death battles. Is that something someone of my age should bear? I didn’t say anything unfair about it, and you have the cheek to tell me it’s unfair?”

A cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes and exploded, venting out all the emotions he had suppressed over the years that even his voice was trembling.

The nearby Su Ziyao, Ye Guhan, Jian Jingtian, and other Great Saints’ hearts trembled upon hearing that. The Serene Dust Great Saint had tears welling in her eyes because she already discovered that Lin Yun was bearing something he shouldn’t for someone his age.

Ye Guhan tightened his grip on his sword, looking emotional. Jian Jingtian’s face was terrifyingly dark, and yet the sect master of the holy land was talking about fairness with Lin Yun. Su Ziyao turned to look at Lin Yun. She cultivated the Empress Heart Sutra. The deeper she loved, the more pain she would feel. However, Su Ziyao never once regretted it. She understood Lin Yun well and was determined to stand by his side even if she had to become an enemy of the world.

Lil’ Purple was seated on the sword box, her face pale from anger. She spent the longest time with Lin Yun, and she knew what Lin Yun experienced over the years. She knew Lin Yun paid a great price to attain his current height. After all, would the Light Subduing Great Saint have the guts to go to the Heavenly Barren Realm?

Back then, he was nearly killed by Tian Xuanzi and hid in the Heavenly Dao Sect under the name of Ye Qingtian. But despite his feelings, she gently told him he was a phoenix and shouldn’t cry.

The Light Subduing Great Saint sneered with his eyes flashing. He made up his mind, and coldly said, “Heaven Glory and Dark Sorrow, kill this brat together with me. If this brat isn’t killed, the Sword Sect will rise even if the Radiant Sword Saint fails his tribulation!”

After he spoke, he reached out and opened his hands. An ancient ‘Ming’ word covered the ground formed with sun and moon saint runes, and the Light Subduing Great Saint wanted to grab a hold of Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun didn’t let down his guard. When the word ‘Ming’ appeared, the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella above him began to rotate, with nine dragon souls appearing while he threw a punch on the ground. Even if the Light Subduing Great Saint had a powerful cultivation, there was no way he could drag Lin Yun over under the protection of nine dragons.

“Do you think that the Radiant’s lineage has no one?!” Ye Guhan charged at the opposing Great Saints with anger on his face. He had grasped Space Dao, and the power of his strike was unimaginably powerful. Even so, his attack was blocked by the Heavenly Sever Great Saint.

“Black Mountain’s seven saints, heed my order! Set up the Primordial God Purging Array!” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint said and the seven of them immediately entered their positions, forming a powerful spiritual array. There were rumors that they could even confront Emperor Realm experts when the Black Mountain’s seven saints joined forces. But because the Netherport Sword Saint was injured back then, the power of this array was weakened.

Even so, this array instantly turned the tables around, forcing Su Ziyao, Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and Dragon Origin Great Saint to join forces to block the array.

“Let’s go!” Mister Ghost and the Demon Clan’s Great Saint joined forces and charged forward. This immediately created chaos as ten-odd great saints clashed once more. This place was massive, but it looked small, with a terrifying saint aura filling every corner.

“The other Great Saints won’t be able to do anything to him. The three of us will join forces and kill him quickly!” The Light Subduing Great Saint led the two Great Saints and charged at Lin Yun, who had destroyed the ‘Ming’ word before it rose to the sky.

The entire Scarlet Firmament Peak was enveloped in saint aura with various phenomena that could be seen from ten thousand miles away.

“They ultimately fought!”

“I already guessed that the Light Subduing Great Saint won’t follow the rules. He wanted to suppress Lin Yun by himself earlier but is ganging up on him now.”

“Who wouldn’t be afraid of Lin Yun’s talent? There were rumors that he couldn’t be stopped since he reached the Saint Realm, and it looks true now.”

“The Light Subduing Great Saint is too despicable!”

“How is he not? He was the one who led the other holy lands, wanting to rule the Ancient Barren Domain. But he was stopped by the Radiant Sword Saint in the end.” Many Saints observing the fight outside the Sword Sect were shocked by the scale of this battle.

“Where are the Sword Sect’s disciples? Form into an array!” Mu Xuankong soared to the sky, releasing his sword intent, and raised his sword to the sky, unleashing a powerful sword ray.

“We’re here!” The Sword Sect’s disciples outside Scarlet Firmament Peak released their sword intent without hesitation toward Mu Xuankong’s direction. In the next second, Mu Xuankong’s sword aura rose once more.

Seeing this scene, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling his blood boiling and roared, “As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies!”

Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword from his chest, releasing a powerful sword aura as he charged at the three Great Saints, laughing.

“You’re courting death!” The Light Subduing Great Saint smiled when he saw Lin Yun wasn’t running. He unleashed eighty-one palms, each infused with his saint aura that caused the surrounding space to tremble.

“Flower Burial, aid me!” Lin Yun shook his wrist and unleashed the Flower Burial Sword’s power as a Sovereign Saint Artifact, unleashing a powerful aura.

“Heavenly Dragon, aid me!” Lin Yun roared, executing the Heavenly Dragon Thirteen Swords and unleashing a powerful sword ray that became a Heavenly Dragon’s claw. The dragon’s claw tore apart the eighty-one palms, leaving the Light Subduing Great Saint shocked since he didn’t hold back in that attack. He couldn’t believe that Lin Yun resolved it so easily.

The sword ray carried forward, forcing the Dark Sorrow and Heavenly Glory Great Saints to join forces against it.

Wielding the Flower Burial Sword, the sword intent radiating from Lin Yun was even more terrifying than Jian Jingtian. It's as though it would break through the shackles of the eighth grade.

“A holy land’s sect master? Doesn’t look so impressive now,” Lin Yun said, looking at the three Great Saints as he hovered in the air. Before the three Great Saints could react, Lin Yun dashed over. His body disappeared and reappeared behind the Heavenly Glory Great Saint.

The Heavenly Glory Great Saint didn’t have time to think and turned around to block this attack. When the sword and blade clashed, the Heavenly Glory Great Saint could feel his palm going numb, losing control of his blade.

“What sword technique is this?!” The Heavenly Glory Great Saint was shocked because this sword technique contained the power of a Heavenly Dragon. But that wasn’t all, it also summoned the Azure Dragon Constellation. He was still sent flying away even after he did his best to block this attack.

After sending the Heavenly Glory Great Saint flying away, Lin Yun didn’t chase after him but stabbed his sword backwards as if he had eyes on the back of his head, unleashing a powerful sword ray. This startled the Light Subduing Great Saint, who was planning to launch a sneak attack. The Light Subduing Great Saint’s face changed before he quickly retreated.

The eighth-grade sword intent was powerful enough, not to mention a Sovereign Saint Artifact, and Yin-Yang Dao empowered it. It had reached a level that it could harm him.

Lin Yun sneered and continued to charge at the Heavenly Glory Great Saint, who raised his blade and grit his teeth to brace against the incoming sword. He also grasped the eighth-grade blade intent, but his blade intent needed to be improved when compared to Lin Yun.

“You think you can block it?” Lin Yun’s sword was like an apocalypse that rained down on the Heavenly Glory Great Saint. Facing his attack, the latter could only barely put up a fight as he retreated.

When Lin Yun performed all thirteen sword forms of the Heavenly Dragon Thirteen Swords, the power of this sword technique overlapped and sent the Heavenly Glory Great Saint flying away. With a shake of his wrist, Lin Yun thrusted his sword.

The sword tip shone like a bright star, thrusting towards the Light Subduing Great Saint, who resorted to another sneak attack. This time, the sword didn’t just contain the power of the Heavenly Dragon Thirteen Swords, it also had the aura of a Divine Phoenix.

This made the Light Subduing Great Saint’s face ugly because Lin Yun used this sword multiple times to seek the weakness in his attack, allowing his sneak attacks to fail. He couldn’t comprehend what was happening, and it made no sense that Lin Yun could sense his means.

This time, Lin Yun didn’t allow the Light Subduing Great Saint to leave. The Flower Burial Sword pointed at the Light Subduing Great Saint’s forehead as the Vermilion Bird and Azure Dragon Constellations descended behind him.

This naturally made the Light Subduing Great Saint lose his patience. After all, no one would be in a good mood to have the Bright Sun Sword Intent pointed at their head with two Sovereign Constellations. He kept retreating but soon reached a dead-end and could only face it head-on with his palm. Furthermore, he also shot out a beam with his left hand, aimed at Lin Yun’s heart.

But Lin Yun seemed to have sensed it and drew the Flower Burial Sword back to block the beam. Turning around, the Flower Burial Sword was like a spear’s tip aimed at the Light Subduing Great Saint.

The Light Subduing Great Saint sneered and didn’t bother dodging this attack, allowing this sword to land on him. He had the protection of the Sun-Moon Saint Cloth, wanting to use it to con Lin Yun. But the next moment, thirty-odd holes appeared on the Sun-Moon Saint Cloth with blood splashing out.

Not only was the Sun-Moon Saint Cloth pierced, but the Light Subduing Great Saint was sent flying away, leaving him baffled.

Lin Yun didn’t stay in the same spot but had spun in the air, dodging the joint attack from Heavenly Glory and Dark Sorrow Great Saints. Their joint attacks left a deep crater on the stage that had been around for over a hundred thousand years.

“Together!” The three Great Saints furiously charged, wanting to surround Lin Yun and suppress him.

“Scumbag, catch!” Seeing that three Great Saints wanted to gang up on Lin Yun, Lil’ Purple threw the sword box over.

When the sword box flew over, it appeared behind Lin Yun and a rope flew out from both ends of the sword box, firmly fixing itself on his back. Donning an azure robe and carrying a sword box, this was Lin Yun’s ‘complete’ form.

The four Sovereign Divine Runes began to shine brightly on the sword box, allowing Lin Yun’s cultivation to catch up to the three Great Saints. This made Lin Yun laugh as he roared, “As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies!”

Lin Yun, initially suppressed by the three Great Saints, suddenly released an outburst of sword aura, swinging three swords. His attacks sent the Heavenly Glory and Dark Sorrow Great Saints flying, throwing out a mouthful of blood and staggering in the air before falling onto one knee to stabilize themselves.

Only the Light Subduing Great Saint managed to withstand Lin Yun’s attack and merely took ten steps back.
