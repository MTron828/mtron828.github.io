Chapter 682 - The So-called Overlord

“W-What should we do now…” Tang Ying said with an ashened face while looking at the crimson pupils of the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture. But in the next second, he took a slap from the white-clothed youth who wore a dark face. The darkened expression on the youth sent a chill down everyone’s spine as Tang Ying started trembling in fear.

The Heavenly Soul Realm expert glanced at Tang Ying before sending the egg towards the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture opened its mouth to catch the egg with a cold light flashing in its eyes. Everyone was nervous when they looked at the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

But right at this moment, the Imperial Sword Herb suddenly appeared from the ground and unleashed a radiance onto the mountain. As the Imperial Sword Herb swayed in the wind, it released a sharp sword intent that brought joy to the white-clothed youth’s face.

“Young master, the Imperial Sword Herb has emerged!” Tang Ying rejoiced, hoping that this would improve the young man’s mood.

“Spread out!” The Heavenly Soul Realm expert’s face suddenly changed as he grabbed onto the white-clothed youth’s shirt and left.

When they raised their heads, they saw nine thick lightning bolts gathering together before landing on the ground. This terrified everyone from the Ironblood Sword Gate as they began to run off. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

When the thunderbolt landed, the entire Lackdragon Slope began to tremble violently. But most of the people reacted quickly. Aside from some unfortunate ones who were reduced to ashes, the rest merely suffered a little impact from the thunderbolt.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s rage still wasn’t pacified, but it looked at the sky fearfully before it decided to leave in the end.

“The Imperial Sword Herb!” The white-clothed youth narrowed his pupils as he quickly ran over with everyone else following behind him. But when they went over, the Imperial Sword Herb was nowhere seen. The white-clothed youth staggered briefly before he managed to stabilize himself.

Looking at this scene, Tang Ying’s face turned pale as he fell onto his knees. “Young master, please punish me!”

Tang Ying started kowtowing on the ground, which dyed his forehead red with blood. But the white-clothed youth walked over without any expression and stomped on Tang Ying’s back.

When Tang Ying hit the ground, he threw up a mouthful of blood. But the white-clothed youth didn’t stop and gave Tang Ying two more stomps, each causing him to throw up blood.

“Why in the bloody hell are you so idiotic!” The white-clothed youth humiliated Tang Ying as he stomped his foot.

“Young master…” The Heavenly Soul Realm expert knew that the white-clothed youth had lost control of his temper and wanted to pacify him.

But the white-clothed youth waved his hand and sighed, “Thirty years of effort have gone down the drain. This is fate. Looks like I need to find another way to get my xiantian sword intent to complete mastery before the Draconic Banquet.”

Turning to look at Tang Ying coldly, he continued, “I’ll let you live for now. Since the egg was given to you by that fly, you need to bring me his head. I’ll make him pay the price.”

“Thank you, young master. Thank you for sparing my life,” said Tang Ying.

When he got back up, Murong Fei and the white-clothed youth had already left as they didn’t wish to stay any longer.

“You caused this, so resolve it yourself.” The Ironblood Sword Gate’s sect master said coldly.

“Search the place and find the bastard! I want to skin him alive!” Tang Ying roared after the sect master left. He couldn't hold back his anger anymore. Based on his estimation, that brat should still be heavily injured, so he must be in the Flamedragon Hill.

“Has it come to an end?” Lin Yun muttered to himself as he was disappointed to see such an exciting show end in this manner. But this wasn’t necessarily bad. Although the Ironblood Sword Gate wasn’t annihilated, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was heavily injured, which would give him a higher chance at gathering its blood essence.

He had to admit that the battle was really breathtaking. The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was really strong. If it wasn’t for the immortal sword intent that heavily injured the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture, no one would be able to escape this place alive.

Although the Heavenly Soul Realm expert had left, Tang Ying was still around. An eerie smile rose up on Lin Yun’s lips, “You want to find me? Don’t worry. You’ll have the chance.”

Then, Lin Yun disappeared into the forest and chased after the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture. Even after it was heavily injured, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was still the overlord of the sky, so countless demonic beasts fled when they saw it flying in the air. They were afraid that they would be discovered by it and killed.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was a demonic beast with the dragon bloodline, not to mention that it had already matured. Even in the Ancient Southern Domain, not many people could suppress it.

“What a pity. If it wasn’t for the immortal sword intent, everyone would have died,” lamented Lin Yun. But they had helped him greatly. After all, he wouldn’t be able to obtain the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s blood essence if they didn’t injure it. He had the perfect opportunity right now.

Four hours later, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture returned to its den as it lay on the ground due to its heavy injuries and fell asleep. It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to hear a rhythmic breathing coming from it.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture must be really tired. Lin Yun noted inwardly. It looked like the battle was extremely exhausting. But just when Lin Yun was about to take a step forward, he suddenly retracted his feet. After all, he had waited for so long, so he naturally wouldn’t mind waiting a little longer to be on the safe side.

When he retracted his feet, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture suddenly opened its eyes, which caught Lin Yun by surprise. Clearly, he had never expected this scene.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture suddenly soared into the sky and revealed a python that was in the Heavenly Soul Realm in its claws. The python had concealed itself perfectly, so not even Lin Yun noticed it.

Injured by the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s claw, the python roared before it pounced at the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture roared and tore the python into two before it managed to get close. The python’s blood and flesh splattered everywhere. Then, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture began digging into the dead python and it didn’t take long before it turned into a skeleton.

Lin Yun was shocked. He finally understood why the den was filled with bones and where they came from. After the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture finished its meal, it released a cry before pouncing in another direction. Not long later, a miserable howl came from a Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast as it fled for its life.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture then began scouting its territory before returning to its den a long time later. When it returned, Lin Yun could tell that its injuries had become even more serious.

“Just what kind of existence am I coming in contact with…” Lin Yun’s face turned pale as he didn’t dare to move.

Lying back down, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture closed its eyes and fell asleep. This time, it had truly fallen asleep because it had already dealt with the surrounding demonic beasts that could threaten it. After a series of battles, it needed rest badly.

But even so, Lin Yun waited for four hours before he stepped forward and concealed himself with the medicinal powder. He carefully walked forward and took out three incense sticks from his interspatial pouch a thousand meters away from the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

That was the Meditation Incense, something that Luo Yu had prepared for him. It could be used to aid in the efficiency of cultivation. But to a heavily injured demonic beast, it could be used as an effective treatment. The one side effect was that the demonic beast would fall into a deeper slumber.

Lin Yun carefully tip-toed over to the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture. He was like a fly compared to the colossal demonic beast as he observed its injuries.

But Lin Yun wasn’t in a rush as he stomped his foot, which made his heart beat faster. When he was sure that there was no reaction from the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture, he knew that it was genuinely asleep.

Knowing that it was finally time for him to make his move, Lin Yun became even more nervous. But right at this moment, a violent wind blew over. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw a huge shadow enveloping him.

It was the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s tail that was swinging at him. It might seem like a casual attack, but Lin Yun knew that it wouldn’t be easy for him if he took it head-on.

Looking at the tail, Lin Yun’s lips twitched. He was sure that the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was in a deep sleep, so what was going on? Was it really smacking a fly?
