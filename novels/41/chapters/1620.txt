Chapter 1621 - What Should We Do?

The black-clothed youth coldly looked at Lin Yun and Gongsun Yan. The nearby Profound Sky Sect’s disciples drew their saint artifacts, each of which was a thousand rune saint artifact. Several saint artifacts reached the height of myriad runes, proving that the Profound Sky Sect was so rich that even an ordinary disciple of theirs wielded myriad rune saint artifacts.

This was unimaginable in the other sects. As for that black-clothed youth, Zhao Sun, the aura he gave off was even more terrifying. He cultivated the Profound Sky Canon and reached a high stage in the Lesser Heavenly Sun. Even without using his saint artifact, the aura he gave off far exceeded the other disciples.

“Who allowed you to leave?” Zhao Sun said, looking at Lin Yun indifferently.

“Zhao Sun, ranked in the top ten on the Profound Sky Sect’s Inner Ranking.” Lin Yun briefly pondered, recalling the information on Zhao Sun. He said, “You’re right. I shouldn’t leave because your head is pretty valuable.”

Hearing that, Zhao Sun was briefly stunned before he laughed.

“Hahaha. Kill me? With that puny ability of yours? Or are you going to call the Radiant Sword Saint over? Don’t think that no one dares to do anything to you just because you’re the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. No one cares about that in the Ancient Barren Battlefield!” Zhao Sun laughed, roaring, “Today, I’ll be killing the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple!”

The other Profound Sky Sect’s disciples laughed because this scene was really hilarious. Lin Yun really didn’t know his current position. Everyone from the Profound Sky Sect was searching for him, and they initially thought Lin Yun would hide somewhere to cultivate. But they never expected that he would be so arrogant as to come to them and even declare that he would take Senior Brother Zhao’s head.

“What’s so funny?” Lin Yun asked indifferently.

The Profound Sky Sect’s disciples weren’t initially bothered, but they soon discovered something wasn’t right. A faint dragon aura was being emitted from Lin Yun.

As Lin Yun’s blood began to boil, he was like a Divine Dragon as he slowly opened his eyes. Sweeping his gaze out, everyone from the Profound Sky Sect felt suffocating, and their faces became ugly.

What’s going on? The hands of the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples began to tremble. Lin Yun was only at the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, so why did he give off the feeling that he was even more terrifying than Senior Brother Zhao?

“He’s just putting on a strong front. Kill him!” Zhao Sun said coldly, sensing that something wasn’t right.

“Lin Yun…” Gongsun Yan panicked.

“Come close to me. Lower your head and close your eyes.” Lin Yun said. His words baffled Gongsun Yan, but he still did as he was told and lowered his head before closing his eyes. When he dropped his hand, Lin Yun’s started forming a seal, and his dragon aura began to multiply. In a split second, the dragon aura had multiplied by twenty-fold. He had executed the Blue Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal, Silver Dragon Seal, and Sovereign Dragon Seal!

With three divine seals empowering the Sovereign Dragon Seal, the power was multiplied twenty-fold, and an ancient seal swiftly formed within Lin Yun’s palm.

The Profound Sky Sect’s disciples flying over were caught by surprise and exploded into a blood mist when they took the attack head-on. As they exploded like fireworks, the Sovereign Dragon Seal’s radiance enveloped every corner within a ten-mile radius. The saint artifacts fell onto the ground, their owners dead.

“How’s this possible?!” Zhao Sun’s face changed, and his jaw nearly fell off. He sensed that something wasn’t right with Lin Yun, so he let the other disciples probe him. But he never imagined that they wouldn’t even be able to last one round. They even died before they could summon their constellations.

Before he could even ponder it, Zhao Sun swiftly executed the Lesser Heavenly Sun. This was the reason why he was able to suppress Gongsun Yan earlier. As the sun rose from his palm, the sunlight and dragon seals’ light clashed within a ten-mile radius.

The next moment, Lin Yun’s Sovereign Dragon Seal and Zhao Sun’s Lesser Heavenly Sun collided. The next second, a draconic roar echoed that pierced through the sun. As Lin Yun’s aura swept out, the dragon seals’ radiance enveloped the surroundings.

This caught Zhao Sun by surprise, and he threw out a mouthful of blood. In the next second, Lin Yun already appeared before him. Zhao Sun quickly summoned his constellation but could only use his fists to face Lin Yun because he didn’t have the time to bring out his saint artifact. He swiftly poured his dragon origin into his arms. Even if he only did it in a hurry, the dragon origin contained in his arms was terrifying with his cultivation at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

But when his attack landed on Lin Yun, it only caused a faint fluctuation. His punches failed to even shatter the dragon runes on the surface of Lin Yun’s body. In other words, he failed to even harm a strand of hair on Lin Yun. But how was this possible?

Zhao Sun directly collapsed. He was dumbfounded, and his mind went blank. With such unfathomable strength, even the top three on the Profound Sky Sect’s Inner Rankings wouldn’t be inferior to him. But they definitely weren’t so terrifying when they were at the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

“Your physique… How did you manage to do it?!” Zhao Sun muttered to himself as he looked at Lin Yun in disbelief.

“Is there a need for me to explain to you?” Lin Yun coldly replied. He suffered a lot to obtain the Blue Dragon Bone and perfect his Azure Dragon Saint Art. So how could his dragon runes possibly be destroyed by someone who was merely ranked in the top ten on the Profound Sky Sect’s Inner Ranking?

Suddenly, Lin Yun pushed his palm forth. His aura began to rise when he pushed his palm forth, and his clothes fluttered in the wind. All the dragon runes on his body flew out, forming a massive dragon. This might seem like an ordinary palm, but his arm had utterly fused with the Divine Dragon.

Taking his attack head-on, Zhao Sun’s armor began to shatter, and a terrifying shockwave swept out. His internal organs began to break, and he would’ve died now if Lin Yun didn’t go easy on him.

As Zhao Sun knelt before Lin Yun, he couldn’t muster any strength. When Gongsun Yan opened his eyes and saw this scene, he was utterly dumbfounded. What did he just see? A genius in the top ten on the Profound Sky Sect’s Inner Ranking couldn’t even take a single move against Lin Yun and was kneeling before the latter.

As for the surroundings, there were only individual saint artifacts and a puddle of blood. The other Profound Sky Sect’s disciples had died, and this scene made Gongsun Yan’s eyes bulge. He only closed his eyes for a breath or two, and the situation completely changed when he opened them.

“Gongsun Yan, where’s Senior Sister and the others?” Lin Yun asked.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“They’re at the Saint Constellation Snow Valley.” Gongsun Yan said after coming to his senses.

“The Saint Constellation Snow Valley?” Lin Yun asked with his brows furrowed.

“That valley doesn’t have any name, but we discovered a Saint Constellation from an ancient powerhouse. So it’s called the Saint Constellation Snow Valley now. Yan Kong has led the eight big sects to seal off that valley. Aside from that, many people are trying to sneak their way in for the Saint Constellation in the valley.” Gongsun Yan said.

“Do you know where it is?”

“I do.” Gongsun Yan said quickly with his eyes lit.

“Bring me there.”

“Okay!” Gongsun Yan said with excitement and flames blazing in his pupils. He previously didn’t want to bring Lin Yun over because the enemies were too strong, and Yan Kong alone could suppress the other saint disciples.

Without Gu Ruochen or Ye Qingxuan, Lin Yun would be courting death if he had gone there. But it was different now because Lin Yun’s strength far exceeded his imagination, not to mention that Lin Yun didn’t even draw his sword, merely used his body-refining technique to suppress Zhao Sun.

“Lin Yun, go save Zhao Yan and others quickly. They’re too pitiful.” Gongsun Yan said.

“Calm down and tell me slowly. What’s the matter?” Lin Yun asked as he calmed down.

“Okay… So…”

After hearing what Gongsun Yan said, Lin Yun’s eyes flickered and fell into deep thoughts. According to Gongsun Yan, the Sword Sect suffered a sneak attack when Ye Ziling and Mu Xueqin went to check the Saint Constellation. Countless people covered the sky. They were the big sects that submitted to the Profound Sky Sect, catching the Sword Sect by surprise.

They were fortunate that the Sword Sect had set up a spiritual array beforehand. In addition to Zhao Yan’s help, they barely managed to bear it to this point.

“Zhao Yan?”

“Yeah. Brother Zhao can face the big sects’ chief disciples after practicing your sword technique. But it was a problem after Yan Kong made a move. Now that I think of it, Brother Zhao purposely forced Yan Kong to make a move and created an opportunity for me to escape.” Gongsun Yan said in a vexed tone. “Otherwise, no one would have been able to flee with that person around.”

“Haha…” While Zhao Sun’s face was covered in blood, and he laughed sinisterly, “You piece of trash. Do you think that you escaped on your own? If Senior Brother didn’t want to go easy on you guys, none of you would have been able to escape. Hahaha! Lin Yun, don’t cower if you have the guts! My Senior Brother, letting this guy out to inform you that the Sword Sect is in danger!”

Gongsun Yan’s face changed, and quickly stepped forth to give Zhao Sun several slaps. Those slaps left Zhao Sun dumbfounded, and he raged, “You piece of trash. I can suppress you with just one hand, and yet you dare to slap me?”

He had no idea of Gongsun Yan’s temper. When he said those words, Gongsun Yan gave him several more slaps. Gongsun Yan looked at Lin Yun and asked, “Lin Yun, what should we do with this fellow? He’s still so stubborn after kneeling on the ground.”

“Hahaha! Lin Yun, kill me!” Zhao Sun’s expression became fanatical. “Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren! The Sword Sect will be destroyed sooner or later, and you can’t do anything to change it, no matter how you try, even if you kill me!”

“You’re courting death!” Gongsun Yan wanted to kill him immediately.

But Lin Yun suddenly stopped him before turning to Zhao Sun, “Stop. You mentioned that Yan Kong is waiting for me?”

“That’s right!” Zhao Sun sneered. “Senior Brother Qin said that everyone in the Sword Sect will die, including the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple! If Senior Brother Yan doesn’t bring your head over, Senior Brother Qin will take his head!”

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly because Qin Tian was another member of the Nether Divinity Clan.

“Haha. Don’t cower!” Zhao Sun snickered, and his gaze was vicious. This made Gongsun Yan furious because Zhao Sun was still provocating Lin Yun even after coming so far.

“Lin Yun, his words do make some sense!”

“Hahaha! Lin Yun, I’m not afraid to tell you honestly. The Profound Sky Saint Sovereign wants to use your head to have the Radiant Sword Saint die before his lifespan ends. You better hide, or your master’s death tribulation might come beforehand once he knows you died in the Ancient Barren Battlefield!” Zhao Sun’s eyes flashed with mockery, and he snickered, “But if you don’t go, everyone from the Sword Sect will die because of you!”

“You talk a lot.” Lin Yun said, looking at Zhao Sun.

“Ha. Am I not right?” Zhao Sun slowly stood up and continued, “Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren! He’ll dominate the entire Ancient Barren Domain sooner or later…”

“Who allowed you to get up on your feet?” Lin Yun said, turning to look at Zhao Sun, and this gaze alone was enough to make Zhao Sun’s legs tremble. Waving his hand, Lin Yun created a hole in Zhao Sun’s chest. When Zhao Sun’s heart shattered, he instantly lost his life.

Lin Yun initially wanted to spare Zhao Sun’s life and see if he still had any value left, but Zhao Sun was getting on his nerves. The sudden death of Zhao Sun left Gongsun Yan dumbfounded.

“Lead the way.” Lin Yun said. Gongsun Yan didn’t know what he was thinking, but it was clear that Zhao Sun’s words affected Lin Yun greatly.

“Senior Brother… What should we do now? Is what that fellow said true?” Gongsun Yan asked in a concerned tone.

“What else? Kill them all!” Lin Yun said, and his words left Gongsun Yan shocked.
