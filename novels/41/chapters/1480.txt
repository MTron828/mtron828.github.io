Chapter 1481 - Twist and Turns

Within the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion in Azurerock City, Lin Yun met An Liuyan as promised. She was still as charming as before with her devilish body, and it was hard for anyone to maintain their composure when looking at her revealed skin.

“Flower Burial, you don’t seem anxious to appear at the last minute. I’ve been waiting for you!” An Liuyan complained and threw a bewitching gaze over.

But Lin Yun’s heart was calm like water since he knew that An Liuyan was just putting on an act. If he was careless, he would die a terrible death without knowing it. After all, he nearly fell for her tricks during their first meeting. Even now, he still couldn’t see through this woman, so he kept his vigilance against her.

“I naturally dare not to be careless since there is news about the Divine Dragon Bone, and I naturally have to be well-prepared for it.” Lin Yun said calmly while avoiding An Liuyan’s gaze.

“Then, I wonder if Young Master Lin can share your preparations with me.” An Liuyan smiled.

“It’s just a small trick, nothing worth mentioning.” Lin Yun smiled.

An Liuyan no longer asked, seeing that Lin Yun wasn’t willing to share, and kept her smile, “Looks like you’re fairly calm and didn’t become over-confident just because you’ve swept through everyone on the Earth Ranking.”

“You seem to be concerned about my affairs?” Lin Yun looked at An Liuyan with a deep gaze.

An Liuyan didn’t shy away from it and replied, “Well, you’re a cooperation partner of mine, so I naturally have to pay attention to you. After all, I’ll be sad if anything happens to you.”

“I believe Lady An has a lot of partners like me, right?” Lin Yun replied.

“Well, not everyone has the strength and ability to be a cooperation partner of mine.” An Liuyan smiled.

Upon hearing that, Lin Yun lowered his cup. An Liuyan was pretty straightforward with her words. He even suspected that An Liuyan had gotten the news on the Divine Dragon Bone much earlier, but she kept it from him. After all, the timing was really coincidental; he was informed of the Divine Dragon Bone’s appearance after he swept through the Earth Ranking.

So he could imagine that if he didn’t display enough potential and strength, she wouldn’t share this piece of information with him. After all, anything that had to do with a Divine Dragon Bone was rare. This made Lin Yun a little furious, but he didn’t say a word since this was merely a speculation of his.

Then again, he didn’t think An Liuyan did anything wrong, even if his speculation was true. His desire for a Divine Dragon Bone had reached the point of being an obsession. So he would be furious if An Liuyan deliberately kept this piece of news from him.

“Time for you to tell me your true identity.” Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to ask about the Divine Dragon Bone and looked at An Liuyan.

“That’s for sure. I’ve promised you before. So let me ask you, where are we right now?” An Liuyan smiled.

“The Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion.” Lin Yun replied without thinking much.

“Haha, it’s just a name in disguise. We’re actually in the Heavenly Star Pavilion!” An Liuyan said, looking at Lin Yun.

It was a sect of the demonic path, as Lin Yun had expected. Back in the Profound Azure Prefecture’s Demon Domain, the Heavenly Star Pavilion was one of the four demonic forces. He knew back then that the Heavenly Star Pavilion had their forces spreading throughout the Kunlun Realm.

But he never expected that the Heavenly Star Pavilion would dare to appear in the Ancient Barren Domain by disguising their name right under the eyes of the Sword Sect.

“The eight powerful sects govern the Ancient Barren Domain and have no conflicts with the demonic sects. The Sword Sect naturally knows about the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion’s true identity, and the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion isn’t the only demonic force within Azurerock City. This world isn’t simply differentiated with black and white.” An Liuyan indifferently replied.

Not everything in the world was differentiated with black and white. There were many grey zones in the world. Everyone would have items that they couldn’t sell openly; this was where the demonic forces came in.

“So, what’s your identity in the Heavenly Star Pavilion?” Lin Yun asked.

“The Heavenly Star Pavilion has Thirteen Star Envoys who can compete for the position of the Young Palace Master. Coincidentally, I happen to be the thirteenth Star Envy.” An Liuyan looked at Lin Yun with a smile.

That was a terrifying position since she would be the young lord of the Heavenly Star Pavilion if she took another step forth. Then again, Lin Yun also knew that it wouldn’t be so easy for her to accomplish that.

“Not many people know about my identity. Can Young Master Lin trust me now?” An Liuyan said with a wink.

If two people wanted to cooperate, they had to be honest with each other. If they couldn’t be honest with each other, they wouldn’t trust each other, and there was no basis for both parties to cooperate. After all, Lin Yun was confident about his bounty, so he would be doomed if An Liuyan betrayed him.

“Where’s the Divine Dragon Bone?” Lin Yun blatantly asked while nodding his head.

An Liuyan’s eyes shone brightly because Lin Yun believed her. She replied, “In an undeveloped lesser astral realm in the eighth-layer of heaven. Then again, I can’t guarantee that you will find the Divine Dragon Bone that you want there.”

Lin Yun looked at An Liuyan suspiciously, then nodded his head since it was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

“Don’t worry, Young Master Lin. The matters of the Divine Dragon Bone are of great importance, and it’s not only your matter alone. I will be going together with you. As for the exact location, I’m afraid I must keep it a secret now.” An Liuyan calmly continued.

“You’ll be coming along?” Lin Yun was surprised.

“An undeveloped lesser astral realm contains all kinds of opportunities for any Elysium Core Realm cultivator. So it’s worth a visit, even if there’s no Divine Dragon Bone.” An Liuyan explained. “This trip is of great significance to me. You and I are just taking what we need.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered because this was different from what he had imagined. There were a lot of details that An Liuyan couldn’t explain through the letter.

“So, when are we leaving?”

“We still have to wait for some people. Young Master Lin can rest in my residence for a few days.” An Liuyan apologized.

“It’s fine. You helped me this time, and I’ll owe you a big one as long as I can obtain that Divine Dragon Bone.” Lin Yun had no objection to what An Liuyan said.

“You’re too serious about this. I’ll take my leave, first.” An Liuyan smiled and bowed before leaving. But when she bowed, she ‘unconsciously’ displayed her voluptuous figure, making her chest ripple like turbulent waves.

“Hmph, that slut!” Lil’ Purple was furious when she came out of her sword box.

Lin Yun’s expression also changed, with a hint of rage flashing across his pupils because he vaguely felt he was being used. But on the other hand, there was no free lunch in this world.

“Lin Yun, she’s messing with you.” Lil’ Purple said indignantly.

“Not exactly. If she told me the location of the astral realm, she’d suffer a huge loss if I threw her aside.” Lin Yun replied.

“She doesn’t trust you.” Lil’ Purple was still unhappy, nevertheless.

“Well, I have never trusted her in the first place, too. Let’s put that aside for now. Tell me, what’s with the thirty-six layers of heaven? I never had a clear thought of it.” Lin Yun smiled.

“That’s nothing!” Lil’ Purple smiled as she tapped her finger in the air. As a golden sphere appeared in the air, she easily drew thirty-six rings around the sphere. She continued to explain, “Simplifying it, this sphere here represents the Kunlun Realm. This is the first layer of heaven, and the thirty-six rings represent thirty-six layers of heaven. They’re like thirty-six arrays enveloping the Kunlun Realm.”

Lin Yun raised his head and looked at the thirty-six rings enveloping the golden sphere, and he instantly understood it with a glance.

“She said that the astral realm is in the eighth-layer of heaven, so it’s over here. But this region is vast, and it’s the same as finding a needle in a haystack if you don’t know the coordinates.” Lil’ Purple said while pointing at the eighth ring.

“It doesn’t matter. I just want to know, can a Divine Dragon Bone really be found in that astral realm?” Lin Yun asked with his eyes flickering.

“Astral realms are derived from fragments of the world from the previous eras, and it has no relation to the Divine Dragon Era. So there’s a possibility of a Divine Dragon Bone being in an undiscovered astral realm.” Lil’ Purple explained.

“I hope that’s the case.” Lin Yun said softly. His obsession with a Divine Dragon Bone was insane. So if An Liuyan dared to deceive him, he couldn’t be blamed for being ruthless at that point in time.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
