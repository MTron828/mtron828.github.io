Chapter 1849 - Fully Armed With Glory Saint Artifacts (1)

Seeing that his identity was exposed, Lin Yun didn’t panic upon seeing that Mei Zihua was still stuttering. He formed a seal and executed the Divine Tortoise Transformation to change his appearance back to Lin Xiao.

When Gu Jun saw this, he instantly recognized it being a secret technique of the Black Tortoise Saint Canon. It seemed to be related to the Divine Tortoise Transformation of the Eight-Nine Divine Art’s Seventy-Two Transformation. But such a secret technique was already long lost.

Not to mention others, no one in the Black Tortoise Clan grasped it at the Eastern Sea. He now knew how Lin Yun managed to conceal his identity from the Heavenly Origin Mirror, but he couldn’t help admitting that Lin Yun was really bold.

But no matter what Gu Jun thought about it, Mei Zihua rubbed his eye and exclaimed in disbelief, “Did I just see it wrongly?”

“You didn’t.” Lin Yun did not want to lie to Mei Zihua. He had no idea why Mei Zihua came here. Through their journey in the Black Tortoise Void Sea, Lin Yun knew Mei Zihua could be trusted, aside from having a habit of showing off. After all, a lot of people said that he was Flower Burial, and the Wind Edge Lord even placed a Demonfeather Order on his head. But how many people believed it?

“Are you really Flower Burial, the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, and first on the Empyrean and Elysium Core Rankings?”

“That’s me.”

“The Flower Burial who slew a Saint Lord while being at the Dragon Pulse Realm outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield?”

“That’s me…”

“The first on the Nirvana Banquet and Dragon Pulse Ranking?!”

“That’s also me.” Sometime later, Mei Zihua could no longer contain his shock. A long time later, he bitterly smiled, “Wait, I made a mistake. You’re not first on the Empyrean and Elysium Core Rankings, but the first on all three rankings! In addition to your achievement outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield, you’re not at all inferior to your senior brother, Jian Jingtian.”

Lin Yun’s gaze was deep, and he stared at Mei Zihua. He didn’t know what Mei Zihua meant, but he could hear that the latter’s words sounded a little emotional. Without him knowing it, the person who was forced to hide at the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had become famous throughout the Eastern Desolation. Not to mention the Eastern Desolation, but no one in the Kunlun Realm didn’t know about the name of Flower Burial.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“So?” Lin Yun asked.

Mei Zihua was briefly stunned, and he smiled, “Brother Lin, you’re afraid that I’ll disclose your secret? Don’t look down on me. I admire heroes the most. Brother Lin placed your life on the line outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield and fought a Great Saint to save your master, and your deed has long spread far and wide.

“I’ll be honest with you. I wanted to befriend you a long time ago; and I actually need your help so I followed you to the Black Tortoise Void Sea. If you’re Flower Burial, that’s even better!” As Mei Zihua spoke, he had great difficulty maintaining his composure, and there were billowing waves in his heart.

Everyone thought Flower Burial was dead or had gone into hiding, and he wouldn’t show himself for the next few decades or a century. But no one would have thought that Lin Xiao was really Flower Burial. In just one year after he left the Ancient Barren Battlefield, he rose rapidly and stepped into the top ten of the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

If everyone knew about it, none of them would probably be able to accept this, not even him. But no matter what, he held no ill intentions against Lin Yun. Let’s not mention Lin Yun saved him multiple times at the Black Tortoise Void Sea, Lin Yun even shared a cup of Demigod Wine with him. Even if he knew Lin Yun’s identity at the Nirvana Banquet, he would probably help Lin Yun conceal his identity.

“I believe you.” Lin Yun said before he turned to Gu Jun. “You’ve recovered? It looks like the Demigod Wine is really extraordinary.”

Gu Jun gave him a drop of heart blood essence to refine the Black Tortoise Chains. If Gu Jun hadn’t recovered, Lin Yun would feel guilty about it. So he naturally wore a smile when he saw that Gu Jun’s injuries had recovered.

“It’s still alright. But in terms of the harvest on this trip, your harvest alone surpasses the three of us, right?” Gu Jun asked with a smile.

The fact that Lin Yun was still alive meant he had successfully made it through his tribulation, reaching the legendary tenth-pulse Dragon Pulse Ranking. Just this harvest was a lot higher than Gu Jun reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm.

The Saint Realm might be uncertain, but it shouldn’t be an issue for Lin Yun to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm in a few decades or a century. There were countless Quasi-Saints in the Kunlun Realm, but there weren’t many at the tenth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

Lin Yun merely smiled. After all, he did receive a huge harvest, and he had undergone a great boost in strength. His Heavenly Dome Sword Intent reached complete mastery, the Azure Dragon Intent was at the sixth grade, his dragon pulses were at thirty thousand feet, his cultivation was at the limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm, not to mention his physique had undergone a great boost with his dragon runes reaching a hundred and eighty thousand. Furthermore, he could temporarily reach the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

“Here, the Myriad Scales Armor. I have already erased the imprint on it.” Gu Jun handed the Myriad Scales Armor to Lin Yun.

“It’s really done!” Lin Yun’s eyes were filled with excitement, coveting the Myriad Scales Armor for a long time. He still remembered how arrogant the Wind Edge Lord was with the Myriad Scales Armor, and not even the Flower Burial Sword could really injure him. If the Wind Edge Lord had a Sovereign Saint Artifact at that time, he might be the one dead instead.

“You’re looking down on me?” Gu Jun said angrily.

“Elder Gu, you must be joking. I’ll refine this first before we leave.” Lin Yun smiled.

“It’s true that we have to leave. Young Master, you have no idea that multiple phenomena have appeared in the Black Tortoise Vault during this period of time, and the entire vault has even showed signs of collapsing. Elder Gu speculated that those two might have fought each other in the Starry Sky Secret Realm!” An Liuyan nodded her head.

“That’s right. Almost everyone has left, and the Black Tortoise Void Sea is a forbidden area, so we have to leave quickly.” Gu Jun said sternly.

“I know.” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered. He then began to refine the Myriad Scales Armor. Without the imprint, this Dragon Clan’s treasure showed great intimacy with him because of his Azure Dragon Saint Physique and Blue Dragon Saint Physique, not to mention he also had the Blue Dragon Bone.

After he refined it, Lin Yun was fully armed with Glory Saint Artifacts. The Flower Burial Sword, Myriad Scales Armor, Black Thunder Chains, and the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads. Even an ordinary Saint might not be so extravagant. After all, most Saints would possess a treasure they used their vitality and saint energy to nourish for centuries, and their power generally far surpassed ordinary Glory Saint Artifacts.
