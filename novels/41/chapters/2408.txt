Chapter 2409 - The Same Youth

Feng Yuan charged out when Bai Yuchen retreated. A dragon’s roar echoed from Feng Yuan’s body as he released a dazzling golden radiance. It was the divine body-refining technique of the Dao Sect, the Nine Profound Golden Physique

Under the aura he gave off, the surrounding space became like a swamp. If it was someone with a weaker cultivation, the pressure alone was enough to immobilize them. The so-called “Nine Profound Golden Physique” used the Subduing Dragon and Tiger Art as the foundation to condense nine profound techniques on the forehead.

Just the dragon’s roar alone was enough to make the souls of others collapse. But Lin Yun shone brightly with a sharp gaze and didn’t suffer any restriction under his Bright Sun Sword Intent.

When they got close to one another, they exchanged ten-odd moves. Feng Yuan used both of his hands, one forming into a claw and the other as a punch. On the other hand, Lin Yun used his sword in one hand, fighting evenly with him.

Lin Yun’s cultivation might not be as strong as Feng Yuan's, but with the Bright Sun Sword Intent and the robe formed with nine thousand ribbons, he was only slightly lacking when compared to Feng Yuan.

With the Nine Profound Golden Physique and the Dao Sect’s secret techniques combined together to unleash a powerful aura, Feng Yuan was strong. Whenever he moved, the sky would crack with boundless starlight shining down.

Lin Yun didn’t choose to clash with Feng Yuan head-on but relied on his Bright Sun Sword Intent. He was like an Azure Dragon, and the Flower Burial Sword would change between a claw, a tail, and a head.

Since Feng Yuan used the Nine Profound Golden Physique, Lin Yun used his Divine Dragon Physique without the Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal. As the Divine Dragon Physique overlapped with his sword, it made Lin Yun’s sword technique become even more terrifying. A cold light flashed within his eyes and gave off a powerful dragon’s aura.

A brief moment later, Lin Yun finally found a weakness and attacked. But this brought a smile to Feng Yuan’s face since he revealed that weakness on purpose. Unlike other geniuses, Feng Yuan’s physique had reached the Saint Realm, as well was his cultivation, so his Nine Profound Golden Physique was stronger than what others could imagine. Even the Buddhist Cult’s Eight-Nine Golden Physique couldn’t be compared to him.

Others might fear the Bright Sun Sword Intent, but not him. He had long noticed that Lin Yun still had many trump cards, and it was hard to restrain the latter with his attainment in the sword. But if Lin Yun was too confident in his sword, things would become different.

The Flower Burial Sword pierced the dragon and tiger phenomenon before stabbing Feng Yuan’s shoulder.

Feng Yuan did this to make his act more realistic, pretending he failed to dodge it. But in reality, he wouldn’t suffer any injuries because of the Nine Profound Golden Physique, and Lin Yun’s sword couldn’t even stab through his clothes.

“You fell for it!” Feng Yuan laughed, and he reached out to grab the Flower Burial Sword with his hand shining brightly and firmly held onto the sword. He looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile, and asked, “What will happen if a swordsman loses his sword?”

But he soon noticed something wasn’t right when he pulled the sword over. When the sword landed on his shoulder, Lin Yun had already let go of the sword and retreated. This meant that if Feng Yuan didn’t hold onto it, the sword would fall to the ground.

What woill happen if a swordsman loses his sword? He gives his opponent a beating! Lin Yun replied with his action and came behind Feng Yuan with his punches landing on the latter’s back, producing a series of explosions.

The punches were painful to Feng Yuan. But with the Nine Profound Golden Physique, the impacts spread into his body. Under Lin Yun’s punches, ripples appeared from the golden light enveloping Feng Yuan like ice breaking apart.

As a seven-colored radiance bloomed, Lin Yun blasted the Sovereign Dragon Seal into the crack, making Feng Yuan throw out a mouthful of blood and sent him flying away.

“You’re courting death!” Feng Yuan was furious, wanting to use his palm to chop at Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun already expected this action and soared to the sky, giving a kick to Feng Yuan’s chest. As he turned around, countless kicks landed on Feng Yuan’s chest like a dragon’s tail lashing out. Each kick could contain a terrifying power of the Divine Dragon Physique, sending Feng Yuan flying away.

On the other hand, Lin Yun landed on the ground with great agility. A sword vibration echoed as Bai Yuchen charged with his sword, unleashing a dazzling sword ray. Countless Azure Birds appeared behind Bai Yuchen as they flew down from the jade pavilion.

Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind as he turned around and performed a flick. Nine thousand ribbons flew out, intertwining in the sky and forming into a massive sword ray, creating a huge impact and a terrifying shockwave that swept out.

As an explosion occurred, the azure birds shattered, frightening Bai Yuchen. But he wasn’t a coward and charged forth, facing the sword ray head-on and cutting it apart with a cold light flashing in his eyes. The incoming sword ray was severed into two like a log while his sword appeared before Lin Yun’s head.

Lin Yun merely glanced at it before putting his left hand behind his right hand like a sword, facing the incoming sword. When the two fingers clashed with the sword, Lin Yun easily received Bai Yuchen’s attacks.

Bai Yuchen had poured all his saint energy into his sword, wanting to cripple Lin Yun’s right hand. But as the Bright Sun Sword Intent gathered on Lin Yun's fingers, the two sword souls coiled around them, making his fingers even tougher than a Saint Sword.

Once they fell into a stalemate, they both began to form a seal with their left hand. One used the Great Profound Sword Canon, while the other used a secret technique of the Heavenly Divine Sword.

Countless sword rays flew out from Bai Yuchen while a cauldron flew out from Lin Yun’s body, releasing a destructive power under the control of the Great Profound Sword Canon. When they clashed, Bai Yuchen threw out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying away.

When the clouds were ripped apart, Bai Yuchen’s sword aura began to crumble, and he took a few steps back when he landed. Raising his head, he looked at Lin Yun with shock, and exclaimed, “How is that possible?!”

Even after losing his sword, Lin Yun still managed to suppress Bai Yuchen’s sword aura.

The Dragonwing War Drum continued to beat as everyone in the surrounding area became nervous. Although Lin Yun might seem to be handling the fight well, they knew how dangerous it was, and Lin Yun would be in danger if he made a mistake. But Lin Yun held on!

Not only did he hold on, but Bai Yuchen, Feng Yuan, and Jiang Yi suffered at his hands. This made them wonder again if Lin Yun actually possessed the strength to suppress an entire generation of geniuses. Right then, a buzzing noise resounded that overshadowed the drums. It was Feng Yuan who tossed and plunged the Flower Burial Sword into the ground, which vibrated after stabbing into the ground

Feng Yuan came over to Bai Yuchen’s side. He wiped the blood off his lips, and said, “Don’t hold back anymore, go all out on him.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Bai Yuchen was shocked, before he nodded with a grave expression. After the previous fight, they knew they weren’t Lin Yun’s opponent by themselves, even though they didn’t use their trump cards, which meant they could only join forces.

Two dao flowers appeared behind Feng Yuan and Bai Yuchen, one representing Yin-Yang Dao and the other representing Five Elements Dao. The two eternal daos gave off a powerful pressure, not to mention that they were compatible.

In the next second, their Eternal Daos began to combine, forming a terrifying phenomenon that made the souls of those seeing them tremble. Even if they did nothing and just stood there, the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage was shaking violently, and Lin Yun’s Bright Sun Sword Intent began to crumble as they approached.

“Not good!”

“Bright Sun Sword Intent can’t withstand the power of two Eternal Daos!”

“It’s impossible, even if he possesses dual sword souls!” Everyone was shocked when they saw this scene because Lin Yun’s Bright Sun Sword Intent gave them a feeling that he was invincible against those of the same generation. But it was being suppressed now!

Lin Yun calmly released the Yin-Yang Dao behind him as Feng Yuan and Bai Yuchen charged over.

“Great!” Lin Yun didn’t panic upon seeing this scene, but calmly performed the Yin-Yang Fist in combination with his Bright Sun Sword Intent.

When a breeze blew past, Lin Yun looked calm and composed, standing firmly even though Feng Yu and Bai Yuchen gave off a powerful aura, and perfectly defended against them with the Yin-Yang Fist. He was bearing tremendous pressure, while the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage was crumbling into pieces, creating an apocalyptic scene.

But right then, a powerful beam of light soared to the sky as another dao flower that represented an Eternal Dao appeared. It was Jiang Yi, who had landed in Bai Yuchen and Feng Yuan’s direction with his Truth Dao.

“Damn it! I thought he wouldn’t make a move, and yet he stood out now that he has recovered!”

“Lin Yun is finished now!” Everyone exclaimed as it was a terrifying scene to see three Eternal Daos combining together.

“Haha! I have been waiting for you!” While everyone was nervous, Lin Yun began laughing and soared to the sky before pushing his palm forth. At the same time, another dao flower representing an Eternal Dao appeared behind him, and the aura he gave off immediately suppressed Feng Yuan, Bai Yuchen, and Jiang Yi.

So what if they grasped Yin-Yang Dao, Five Elements Dao, and Truth Dao? They are nothing before Nirvana Dao!

The radiance given off by his Nirvana Dao shone brightly.

“H-How is this possible?!” Jiang Yi, Bai Yuchen, and Feng Yuan were dumbfounded. “How can someone grasp two Eternal Daos? Not to mention that one of them is Nirvana Dao!”

“C-Can something like that even be accomplished?” Everyone was dumbfounded.

Even Luo Tianxi was shocked by this scene, dropping the sticks in his hands.

Everyone looked in shock as the azure-clothed youth soared to the sky with a fire blazing in his eyes.
