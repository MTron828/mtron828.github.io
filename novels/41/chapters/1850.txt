Chapter 1851 - Bold

Aside from Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi, the faces of the other holy land parties also sank when they saw the Fire God General’s party’s appearance.

The Blood Moon Sect was a public enemy in the entire Kunlun Realm, not only the Eastern Desolation. That was different from the Demon Gate because the Demon Gate was founded by one of the Nine Emperors, the Demon Emperor. The Demon Emperor was also someone who commanded all the demonic cultivators within the Kunlun Realm.

Even if the Demon Emperor had long fallen out with the Divine Dragon Empire, everyone knew that the Demon Gate was still considered a force within the Kunlun Realm. But that was different for the Blood Moon Sect. There were rumors that the Blood Moon Sect had long colluded with fiends and turned their fangs on their own kind within the Kunlun Realm.

Their forces covered the entire Kunlun Realm. Back then, when the Blood Monarch was still around, the Blood Moon Sect’s forces could be found everywhere within the Kunlun Realm. If the Nine Emperors didn’t stand out, the entire Kunlun Realm would have probably fallen under the Blood Moon Sect’s control.

“Fire God General, how dare a lackey of the demonic cult like you still dare to show yourself. Are you courting death?” The Heavenly Flame Sect’s Yan Chihuo coldly looked at the Fire God General, his facial expression becoming ugly. Not only he but the other holy lands’ geniuses also had disgust on their faces.

After all, the Fire God General was arrogant at the Black Tortoise Sea, and yet he had been suppressed by Lin Yun to the point that even the Nethermoon Saint Armor couldn’t let him catch his breath. While there might still be room for discussion when it came to Lin Yun, they had no room for discussion with those from the Blood Moon Sect.

“Ha. Why can’t I come?” The Fire God General sneered. “You guys, the so-called ‘holy land geniuses’, might seem upright on the surface, but you people aren’t any better yourselves. You lost to Lin Xiao, and yet you want to stop him here and retrieve the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. Don’t you guys feel ashamed of yourselves?”

He didn’t go easy and jabbed at the sore spot of the holy land geniuses.

“How dare you!” The Divine Dao Pavilion’s Lin Qingyang coldly roared. “The Golden-Purple Dragon Crown is a powerful treasure, and Lin Xiao isn’t strong enough. If it’s snatched by someone else, it will cause dire consequences. We only want to preserve it for him, and we can even exchange it with him for something else. Don’t treat us the same as you!”

The Fire God General snickered with mockery filling his pupils. He said, “Since your holy lands can safe keep it for him, why can’t my Blood Moon Sect? Or do you think my Blood Moon Sect’s offer can’t match up to you guys?”

“Everyone, let’s not waste time with someone like him. Since he came to die, we’ll capture him. This bastard from the demonic cult killed many of our people at the Black Tortoise Void Sea, so there’s no need to be polite with him!”

“Well said! The demonic cult’s dogs are all scum, and anyone who runs into them should kill them!” Someone from the Heavenly Flame Sect already couldn’t hold it any longer, and a grey-robed youth stood out.

Back at the Black Thunder Vault, the Fire God General had killed disciples of the Heavenly Flame Sect. That was because the Fire God General was too arrogant, and he didn’t place anyone within his eyes.

After he spoke, that person charged towards the Fire God General with his fifth stage Profound Life Stage cultivation. He might’ve been fearful of the Fire God General back at the Black Tortoise Void Sea, but he didn’t have any concerns outside. The youth appeared before the Fire God General in the blink of an eye, and unleashed a powerful Flame Intent the moment he got close.

Terrifying fire clouds immediately appeared in the sky above everyone, emitting a horrifying aura. The Fire God General’s face didn’t change; he merely stepped back. As the other party approached, the Fire God General took three steps back but still took a punch to his chest.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Shrouded in the flames, a palm flickering with golden radiance imprinted on Fire God General’s chest. This brought a smile to the faces of those from the holy lands, but their smiles soon froze on their faces the moment it appeared.

This was because the Fire God General didn’t take a step back, and their smiles became even more bizarre as the boundless dragon origin and Flame Intent poured into the Nethermoon Saint Armor. The grey-clothed youth felt as though he had fell into a quagmire and didn’t even cause a ripple on the Fire God General.

“What’s going on?” The grey-clothed youth’s face changed, with shock filling his pupils.

“Ha.” The Fire God General suddenly moved and held onto the other party’s wrist before wearing a smile.

“Damn it!” The grey-clothed youth roared, grabbing onto the Fire God General’s wrist, with the intent of shaking the latter away. But something no one expected occurred. The moment they exerted force at the same time, the hand of that grey-robed youth was crushed.

“Mu Feng, come back!” An elder at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage from the Heavenly Flame Sect roared.

“You should have obediently stayed behind.” The Fire God General said as his right hand became shrouded in a crimson radiance. He then dug out the grey-clothed youth’s heart with a gentle stab before crushing it with a clench.

As blood splashed around, the torrential murderous aura immediately knocked the grey-clothed youth away. This left all the holy land geniuses stunned, and they looked at the Fire God General in disbelief. This was because the Fire God General was a lot stronger than when he was at the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

A brief moment later, everyone came to their senses and understood that the Fire God General had long reached the Profound Death Stage.

“How dare you!” A white-haired elder from the Heavenly Flame Sect finally couldn’t contain his fury and released his aura that was at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage. When the nirvana aura filled his body, a terrifying aura came crashing down, making many people in the surroundings take several steps back.

“Good!” The Fire God General laughed, and he faced the elder’s palm head-on. But the power from the pinnacle Nirvana Stage made the Fire God General’s face become pale with blood dripping from his lips. But his face was sinister, and his eyes were covered in bloodshot.

The runes on the Nethermoon Saint Armor bloomed, and he managed to block this attack head-on. Even if he lost the battle, he didn’t take a step back. This alone was shocking, even if he had borrowed the power of the Nethermoon Saint Armor. This also further proved that the Nethermoon Saint Armor could unleash different powers in different people's hands.

Even if they possessed a Glory Saint Artifact, they might not be able to take a blow from a Nirvana Stage expert head-on, not to mention one at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage.

“Get lost!” The elder from the Heavenly Flame Sect was thoroughly enraged and used brute force to force the Fire God General back.

“Hahaha!” When the Fire God General landed on the ground, he smiled, “As expected of the pinnacle Nirvana Stage. I nearly suffered greatly because of it.” He was confident in himself and wasn’t furious even when facing the elder. It was as though he had just killed a dog and had never considered the consequence.

“Elder Mu, don’t be careless!” Xiao Yuanqi warned.

“This is a matter of my Heavenly Flame Sect. It has nothing to do with your Heavenly Dao Sect.” The elder roared, turning back to glare at Xiao Yuanqi.

“Old man, you’re really arrogant.” The Fire God General wiped the blood off his lips and smiled, “Speaking of which, the Heavenly Dao Sect is on a whole new level than the Heavenly Flame Sect.”

“How arrogant even when death is imminent!” The old man’s gaze became cold, and he arrived before the Fire God General, wanting to suppress him. Even if the Fire God General possessed a Glory Saint Artifact, it was practically impossible for the Fire God General to resist someone at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage.

Just when everyone felt that the Fire God General was about to go down on his knees, the mysterious black-clothed person that arrived together with the Fire God General’s group took a step forth. As afterimages followed behind him, he grabbed onto the neck of the elder from the Heavenly Flame Sect.

This elder at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage was like a chick in his hands and was lifted to the sky. In the next second, the black robe covering the mysterious black-clothed man ripped apart, revealing an old man wearing the Nethermoon Saint Armor. But that wasn’t all. A wave of saint aura was also being emitted from this old man.

Under the pressure he gave off, the Heavenly Flame Sect’s elder had fear on his face as he looked at the other party, “Quasi-Saint…”

Everyone from the holy lands was horrified. The Blood Moon Sect actually dispatched a Quasi-Saint over? Could it be they were laying down an ambush here?

The Quasi-Saint of their clans were still on the way, and they still needed a day or two to arrive. But the Blood Moon Sect’s Quasi-Saint was already here, which meant they came prepared to wait for them. But weren’t they a little too bold? After all, this would definitely draw intense retaliation from the six holy lands.
