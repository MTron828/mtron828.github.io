Chapter 2392 - I Refuse

Beyond the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage was a pavilion of the Heavenly Saint Courtyard, and there was a long path of blue slabs.

The style of the buildings was grand, with various stone statues and pillars. They gave off a faint radiance, filled with a divine rhythm. The gathering was held in the Fuyao Palace, where everyone came over with Feng Bumao. Zither music and dance could be seen as everyone gathered in clusters.

As the host, Feng Bumao was naturally at the center of attention with several geniuses around him. When Xia Qingyun led Lin Yun’s party, everyone’s attention turned to Xia Qingyun. This was because Xia Qingyun was the first beauty in Heaven’s Gate, and she was the center of attention wherever she went, not to mention Yue Weiwei and Ji Zixi behind her.

Everyone wore a smile with the intent of coming forth to greet her, but they were stumped when they saw Lin Yun. Xia Qingyun personally brought Lin Yun over? When they came to their senses, their minds blew with their faces becoming playful.

“Flower Burial, I advise you to consider again if you want to become my servant, and I can recommend you to cultivate with the Qilin Sword Immortal,” a cold voice resounded, coming from the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son. He had shocked everyone when he displayed his Space Dao, and many people wanted to get acquainted with him. He was lifting a cup of wine as he looked at Lin Yun with a smile.

“After all, the Emperor said that you’re a peerless prodigy swordsman, and it would be a pity if you don’t follow the Qilin Sword Immortal,” the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son said. But when he mentioned “peerless prodigy swordsman,” many people wore mocking smiles.

Before Lin Yun could speak, a cold and domineering voice resounded, “Become your servant? Who do you think you are? Get lost. No one asked you to speak.”

Everyone was shocked when they heard that and saw that it was Lin Jiangxian who spoke. But her gaze was sharp, which made everyone feel a chill down their spines.

No matter what others think, the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was nothing in Lin JIangxian’s eyes, and he could only try and flaunt his existence after being rejected by Yue Weiwei to prove that Yue Weiwei chose the wrong person.

Lin Jiangxian’s persistence for Sword Dao was pure, and she was filled with admiration for Lin Yun. So, she naturally wouldn’t watch as someone tried to humiliate him.

Everyone was surprised because Lin Jiangxian’s words were too ruthless. Most importantly, she left a deep impression on everyone, and no one could look down on her.

“Lin Jiangxian, you’re merely someone chased out from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion, so who do you think you are?” Someone from Qilin Mountain coldly spoke out.

“My sword can easily kill dogs like you,” Lin JIangxian said, domineering.

“You...!” That person looked at Lin JIangxian. He wanted to make a move on the spot, but he didn’t dare.

Right then, an indigo-clothed youth stepped out, and anyone could tell that this person was a swordsman. This was the swordsman that even made Lin Yun feel a little afraid during the day.

The indigo-clothed youth said, “Lin Jiangxian, the divine son is just trying to express his goodwill and save him. You don’t think that there are no consequences for him killing those people during the ninth testing ground, right? The Dao Sect, Heavenly Sword Pavilion, and Shadow Divine Palace won’t let this matter rest so easily. His only chance is to stay with the Qilin Sword Immortal and cultivate for a hundred years.”

Everyone recognized this indigo-clothed youth, who was from the sixth testing ground, Ji Zhangkong. He also had a terrifying origin as ‘Ji’ was an ancient surname that produced a ruthless genius in each generation. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Lin Jiangxian coldly said, “We don’t need his goodwill.”

Ji Zhangkong was stunned, before he looked at Lin Jiangxian with admiration. He smiled, “A peerless prodigy swordsman? You’re the true prodigy in my eyes.”

“I’m not even one-thousandth of him,” Lin Jiangxian said seriously, and her words caused an uproar. This was because everyone had witnessed Lin Jiangxian’s strength when she defeated Di Feng. So they couldn’t figure out why Lin Jiangxian was protecting Lin Yun. Hearing what she said now, they only felt that she was exaggerating it.

“Brother Ji, don’t bother. Let’s just watch how he’ll die since he’s not willing to accept my goodwill.” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son shrugged and drank the wine in his cup before leaving with Ji Zhangkong.

“Everyone here is a guest, so let us put aside the grudges today. I’ll give everyone a toast!” Feng Bumao smiled as he raised the cup in his hand, and the atmosphere in the hall recovered.

Lin Yun and Lin Jiangxian exchanged a look, nodding at each other. Since Lin Jiangxian was willing to stand out for him, he could have an easier time here. He looked at the others, and smiled, “There is great wine here. Come, let’s have a drink.”

The group sat together as they enjoyed themselves without interacting with anyone else.

Far away, the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, who pretended to be calm, had his face becoming dark when he saw this scene and he was being ignored. Lin Yun only got Lin Jiangxian to deal with him, so this was the same as saying that he wasn’t worthy of talking to Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s group was arrogant even though there were many geniuses here.

“Flower Burial, we meet again,” a voice resounded as a white-clothed youth looked at Lin Yun with a smile.

Looking at this person, Lin Yun finally recalled that this was the white-clothed youth he encountered earlier in the street. The youth even asked him why he kept such a low profile, since it was unlike him. They only met once, so Lin Yun never expected to see him here.

“How did you come here?” Lin Yun smiled. He didn’t recall this youth being amongst the two hundred who made it to the next round.

The white-clothed youth smiled, “I came here openly, and no one will suspect me upon seeing how young I look.”

“What’s your name?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Feng Qingyu. Do you know the Trigram Star Cluster’s Feng Clan?” The youth asked with a smile.

He naturally heard of it, but only bits and pieces.

Feng Qingyu laughed, “This is the Heavenly Jade Saint Wine of the Heavenly Saint Courtyard. I’ll go steal some!”

“This fellow looks familiar.” Yue Weiwei muttered, looking at Feng Qingyu.

“The Trigram Star Cluster’s Feng Clan? Lin Jiangxian, do you know about him?” Lin Yun asked.

Lin Jiangxian shook her head.

“Then, there’s no need to care about him. This person is sincere, unlike others,” Lin Yun smiled. He could sense goodwill from this youth, and he was carefree, unlike the other geniuses here.

Halfway through the banquet, Xia Qingyun returned and finally said why she invited Lin Yun. She smiled, “Young Master Lin, were you playing the Ni Chang Dress Song during the day?”

Lin Yun nodded, and Yue Weiwei instantly knew what was going on. She looked at Xia Qingyun with a playful smile.

Xia Qingyun’s eyes shone brightly, and she smiled, “I wonder if Young Master Lin can play it for me? I’ll dance for you, and I also know the Nine Profound Heavenly Dance.”

The dance that Yue Weiwei performed during the day was called the Nine Profound Heavenly Dance, and any woman would be anxious about it, not to mention a beauty like Xia Qingyun.

The hall became silent from being shocked that Xia Qingyun would look for Lin Yun to play a song for her, and she would dance for it. This was something that no one could expect.

“I’m sorry, but I can only play it for someone I like. Otherwise, I won’t be able to weave the dress,” Lin Yun refused.

Everyone took in a breath and became nervous. Even Xiong Tiannan shivered and nearly dropped his cup after seeing Lin Yun refusing the first beauty of Heaven’s Gate.

Xia Qingyun’s smile froze, but she still retained her manners, and smiled, “So, the Ni Chang Dress Song can only play for the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden?”

Lin Yun said nothing while Yue Weiwei smiled, “Big Sister Xia, you can pick other songs. Big Brother Lin knows a lot of songs.”

“It’s a pity, then.” Xia Qingyun rejected it since she only wanted the Ni Chang Dress Song.

After rejecting Xia Qingyun, Lin Yun was bored and left the Fuyang Palace with everyone, leaving carefreely.

“Big Sister Yue, why did Xia Qingyun want Big Brother Lin to play the Ni Chang Dress Song? Can’t other songs do?” Ji Zixi asked curiously.

Yue Weiwei didn’t reply, but Lin Jiangxian replied, “That’s because she was shadowed during the day. She was the first beauty of Heaven’s Gate, with her name spreading far and wide throughout the three thousand realms for her beauty. But I didn’t expect Young Master Lin to reject her so openly...”

Lin Jiangxian couldn’t help smiling as she looked at Lin Yun with a playful gaze.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts, recalling how he re-encountered Yue Weiwei at the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. He said, “I didn’t lie to her. The Ni Chang Dress Song can only be played to someone you love, requiring the dance to match perfectly. She thought it was so simple.”

As he explained, he looked at Yue Weiwei, and they smiled at each other. After being together for so many years, how could their relationship be as simple as what others think?

Upon returning to the courtyard, Lin Yun didn’t rest and planned to break into the eighth-stage Saint Lord. Now that he possessed the Divine Dragon Physique, he wouldn’t have to worry about his tribulation, and his Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon also smoothly reached the eleventh stage.

The night was quiet as Lin Yun closed his eyes to play the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, playing the Dragon-Phoenix Score that Lil’ Purple taught him to consolidate the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon.
