Chapter 2050 - Sword Saint's direct disciple

Even if they could win, it wouldn’t be easy, and there wasn’t much meaning in it.

Zhao Quan sneered, “Weaklings like you should clearly understand your position. There are many things you can’t interfere with in this world.”

The Sword Sect was furious, and even Gongsun Yan was furious. They all had a deep relationship with Lin Yun and naturally couldn’t bear someone talking bad about him. Gongsun Yan roared, “You bastard! If Big Brother Yun was still around, you guys would be in no position to be cocky!”

Lin Yun looked at Zhao Quan and the masked white wolf, wanting to teach them a lesson.

“Is there no one else in Eastern Desolation? How long has it been, and yet you guys are still talking about Flower Burial? Is he your father?” Zhao Quan mocked everyone. The insult in his tone was strong, instantly causing everyone from the Eastern Desolation to lose their temper. Many people wanted to charge forth, but those beside them stopped them.

“A dog dares to be so cocky? Do you really think there’s no one in the Eastern Desolation?” An overbearing voice echoed. This voice wasn’t loud but reverberated within everyone’s ears. It was Zhong Yi who stood out from the crowd.

He was the disciple of one of the Eastern Desolation’s Three Sword Saints, the Netherlift Sword Saint, and his cultivation had reached the pinnacle ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. When everyone saw Zhong Yi standing out, they were excited because they believed in his strength. After all, he was the Netherlift Sword Saint’s direct disciple and could be considered a banner of the Eastern Desolation’s sword dao geniuses.

“As expected of the Sword Saint’s direct disciple!”

“That’s because Zhong Yi has kept a low profile. He possesses a saint physique, and his aptitude is even higher than Flower Burial. They’re not on the same level.”

“Zhong Yi can definitely represent Eastern Desolation!”

Zhao Quan briefly glanced at him and said, “Finally, someone interesting. The Netherlift Sword Saint is famous, and I bet his direct disciple must have a skill or two.”

They were actually here for Zhong Yi to probe his strength on behalf of Zhao Wuji.

“Let me face him,” the masked white wolf said. Zhao Quan looked at the masked white wolf and didn’t say a word, but heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He was actually fearful because Zhong Yi was on a different level than An Ziyun, and he might not be able to curb Zhong Yi in terms of attributes.

“Big Brother Quan, you can rest first. Let me deal with him,” the masked white wolf said.

“Hahaha! Good, I’ll leave it to you, then!” Zhao Quan laughed.

When the Eastern Desolation’s swordsmen saw this scene, their faces were filled with dissatisfaction. Zhong Yi’s opponent should be Zhao Wuji or their big brother, Zhao Hu, who wore the black tiger mask. But who the hell was this person wearing a white wolf mask?

Zhong Yi frowned, “Zhao Wuji, you’re not afraid that I can’t hold back and accidentally kill your sword servant?”

But Zhao Wuji merely smiled and ignored Zhong Yi.

The masked white wolf smiled, “You can kill me if you have that ability. I’ll accept my death willingly. But I’m afraid you might not be as strong as your reputation. So what if you’re a Sword Saint’s disciple? There’s nothing impressive about the Radiant and Netherlift Sword Saint!”

“You dare insult my master?” Zhong Yi’s gaze became cold.

“Hahaha! So what if I insulted your master? I’ll show you how I beat up a Sword Saint’s disciple today! Even Flower Burial will have to kneel before me if he shows up here!” The masked white wolf laughed and dashed over. When he pushed his palm forth, a huge palm appeared above Zhong Yi with saint runes covering the palm, releasing a dazzling radiance that contained a destructive aura. Before his palm even descended, a series of explosions echoed with his palm shining like a bright sun.

“That’s the Great Sun Subduing Palm!”

“Is that the Great Sun Saint Rune? Is he really a sword servant?” The faces of everyone from the Eastern Desolation changed.

The Great Sun Subduing Palm was a horrifying ghost spirit martial technique, and the saint rune in the palm had reached a terrifying height, releasing a dazzling radiance. This time, the morale of everyone from the Eastern Desolation dropped.

“Zhong Yi, kneel!” The masked white wolf roared with the Great Sun Solar Rune in his palm, shining brightly like an actual sun.

This scene changed Zhong Yi’s face because he felt pressure from the masked white wolf, even with his cultivation. This made him wear a grave expression, and he should’ve known not to underestimate this person.

“Heavenly Nether Saint Radiance!” Zhong Yi roared, activating his saint physique, and released his Quasi-Astral Sword Intent. When the powerful aura of a saint physique swept out from his body, it shone with a dazzling radiance that stopped the palm from descending.

At the same time, a sword appeared in his right hand. When he drew the sword, his Quasi-Astral Sword Intent shone, creating fine cracks on the huge palm.

“Natal saint physique…” The masked white wolf didn’t panic at this scene. Just when Zhong Yi’s sword aura was about to reach the peak, the masked white wolf’s heart throbbed violently with his blood boiling like a cauldron.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Natal sword heart!” Everyone looked at the masked white wolf with fear on their faces.

“Kneel!” The masked white wolf smiled, and the power of his palm increased.

Zhong Yi only managed to draw his sword halfway before he fell onto one knee and showed a taxing expression. When the palm descended, a powerful shockwave swept out that reached every corner of the plaza.

Everyone was either making a move or drawing their swords to resist the incoming pressure. But even so, many people threw out a mouthful of blood and fainted.

When Zhong Yi stood under the flames, he threw out a mouthful of blood and looked at the masked white wolf with shock in his pupils. He asked, “Who the hell are you?! With your talent, you can’t be a nobody!”

The masked white wolf said, “Perhaps I had some reputation in the past, but I’m now Young Master’s sword servant, White Wolf!”

White Wolf stepped forth and drew his sword, charging at Zhong Yi. Ten moves later, a powerful sword aura swept out from White Wolf and charged at Zhong Yi.

“Damn it!” Zhong Yi was filled with reluctance when he slammed against a stone pillar. He was a Sword Saint’s direct disciple but couldn’t defeat a sword servant. He refused to believe that this was his defeat and stood up, activating the Heavenly Nether Saint Physique to treat his injuries. He wanted to use his saint physique to suppress his opponent.

“Good!” White Wolf laughed as a sword vibration echoed from his body. As he began to release a jade radiance, the dazzling radiance made everyone close their eyes. A powerful sword aura also swept out and was suppressed by White Wolf’s saint physique instead.

White Wolf was like a peerless sword as he became enveloped in the jade radiance. The sword vibration from his body echoed even louder before forming into a pillar of light, soaring to the sky. This immediately extinguished the radiance coming from Zhong Yi’s body.

“How is this possible?!” Everyone exclaimed as they stood up with shock on their faces.

White Wolf laughed as his hands formed together, and the black cloths were like wings unfolding behind him, making his sword aura even more terrifying. His sword intent hadn’t reached Astral Sword Intent, but it wasn’t inferior and reached a terrifying height.

“That’s the Natal Sword Physique!” Everyone took in a breath after they recognized White Wolf’s saint physique. The Natal Sword Physique paired with the Black Plume Sword Canon, White Wolf was practically invincible, and it didn’t take long for Zhong Yi to fall on his knees.

“Hahaha! So what if you’re a Sword Saint's direct disciple? You still have to kneel before me!” White Wolf cockily laughed.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun managed to recognize White Wolf and finally knew why this person had such a huge grudge with the Sword Sect. He had to admit the world was really small to run into this person again.
