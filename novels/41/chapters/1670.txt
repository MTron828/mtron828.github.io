Chapter 1671 – Ten Days

“Since that’s the case, I’ll wait for you in the Heavenly Dao Sect.” Lin Yun finally gave in.

“Hmph, that’s only if you still remember this empress. You’re a scumbag, and you might have forgotten about me by then.” Lil’ Purple said. Despite saying that, she smiled.

After they briefly chatted, they went back to the main topic. “Alright, let this empress examine your injuries.”

When they placed both of their hands together, Lil’ Purple closed her eyes and poured her phoenix origin into Lin Yun’s body, having it course through him. He seemed to have pretty much recovered most of his injuries under the nourishment of the Blue Dragon Bone, since they didn’t looked to be that serious, and it would only take two or three days for a complete recovery.

But in reality, Lin Yun's injuries this time were severe. The Blue Dragon Bone fused with the Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood. So even if Lin Yun lost his arm, he could regenerate a new one, it’s just that it would be a great exhaustion on the Blue Dragon Bone. So one could imagine how serious his injuries were that he needed a few days to recover.

In the end, the wisp of phoenix origin moved towards Lin Yun’s four dragon pulses. His dragon pulses were heavily damaged, and they were barely connecting. Aside from that, the four dragon pulses were a tangled mess within his body. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Most importantly, the dragon pulses were at least ten feet before, but were heavily damaged from the origin. So even if Lin Yun recovered from his injuries, it wouldn’t be easy for him to recover to his peak. The Blue Dragon Bone also couldn’t do anything to help with his dragon pulses.

The Blue Dragon Bone could practically recover from various injuries and contained a boundless vitality that could even deal with poison. But if something was already withered, to begin with, it was pointless to even infuse vitality into it. Take the Radiant Sword Saint as an example. Even if he had the Blue Dragon Bone, he couldn’t use it to extend his lifespan. The condition of Lin Yun’s dragon pulses was somewhat similar, but they were more complicated.

A brief moment later, Lil’ Purple opened her eyes and sighed, “You’re really confident in yourself to claim that you can recover them within half a year. They’re troublesome even for me.”

But Lin Yun was pretty optimistic about it and smiled, “This is already the best possible outcome. I already suffered serious injuries when I forcibly lifted the third restriction on the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. Not to mention that I even summoned the Firmament Saint Cloth. I’m lucky that my dragon pulses didn’t break.”

But Lil’ Purple didn’t bother about him and said, “You can more or less recover your four dragon pulses in half a year, but it’ll be troublesome to reach your peak.”

“You’re more pessimistic than me. I’m pretty optimistic about it because no other Dragon Pulse Realm expert has the experience of fighting Saints. As long as I endure this ordeal, my strength will increase onefold, even if I have to wait half a year or even a year.” Lin Yun said confidently.

“That might be the case, but what about now? How do you plan to make it through? Don’t tell me that you’re going into secluded cultivation here?” Lil’ Purple briefly paused before she continued, “Moreover, your dragon pulses have now withered like the withered roots of a tree. Even if you recover on the surface, it’ll still be hard for you to reach your peak.”

Lin Yun furrowed his brows upon hearing that because it was a problem he had to resolve now. He held onto his chin and fell into deep pondering. He naturally didn’t have the luxury of time to wait, and it would be a huge waste just to wait a month, not to mention an entire year.

If he couldn’t use his dragon origin, his only means of attacking left would be the dragon runes and the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. As for his sword techniques, he wouldn’t be able to use any of them, and the power of his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent would significantly drop without his sword techniques and sword sutra supporting it.

His Heavenly Dome Sword Intent was his biggest trump card, and the two sword sutras were his foundation. The Carefree 9 Swords were his strongest attacking means. So without them, he would be in danger if he ran into some trouble.

Compared to his state when he slew Qin Tian, he only had 40% of his strength now. So Lil’ Purple’s reminder made him furrow his brows because he realized the trouble that he was in.

“Hmph, why don’t you take a look at me.” Lil’ Purple said unhappily when she saw Lin Yun’s brows locked together.

Raising his head, he instantly knew what Lil’ Purple was intending. She wanted him to beg her. Thus, he smiled, “What solution does our empress have?”

“Hmph! I naturally have a solution to that.” Lil’ Purple said proudly.

As Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, he said, “No wonder you’re the most beautiful phoenix of the Divine Phoenix Clan. I’m all ears.”

“Firstly, you can consume the Heavenly Snow Lotus to resolve your current troubles. It might be hard to find, but you can still buy the leaves and seeds. Although they won’t be able to help you recover completely, they can help you save a lot of time.” Lil’ Purple said.

“Heavenly Snow Lotus?”

“That’s right. More accurately, it should be the Heavenly Bloodfrost Lotus because it’s crimson, like the color of blood, and it’s bone-chilling cold. It’s extremely rare.” Lil’ Purple said.

“Is there anything else that can help me recover?”

“There is the Divine Blood Phoenix Lotus. But don’t bother thinking about it because the value is even higher than your Divine Blood Fruit.” Lil’ Purple shook her head. “There are many ways to treat your injuries, but those treasures are extremely precious. So there’s no point for you to know about them.”

Lin Yun no longer asked when he heard what Lil’ Purple said.

“Before you completely treat your injuries, if you don’t want to hide like a turtle, you can only cultivate music dao. Your greatest trump card is the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, but it’s practically useless now that you can’t circulate your dragon origin. But you can try to wield your sword with music.” Lil’ Purple said. “You might have grasped some music dao in the past, but you’ve barely made your foot in it. You never focused on it, but you don’t have a choice now.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts upon hearing that because Lil’ Purple wasn’t wrong about that. He had a choice in the past but only took it as a hobby.

“That’s a solution.” Lin Yun muttered, holding onto his chin.

If he could wield the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent with music, he would instantly recover 80% of his strength. If he could take another step further, he could reach his peak using another path.

“Lil’ Red will still take another ten days to arrive, so I’ll put you through hell training. You better be prepared.” Lil’ Purple said seriously.

Lin Yun didn’t have a choice because he would die with his current strength if his identity was exposed at the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. Even if he had the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, it was practically impossible to bring out the full power of the Sovereign Saint Artifact by relying on the dragon runes alone. As this matter involved his life and death, Lil’ Purple didn’t dare to treat it lightly.

A brief moment later, Lin Yun said, “I understand.”

“Aside from music dao, don’t neglect your Sovereign Dragon Fist and Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art. Those two don't require your cultivation.” Lil’ Purple said.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun said, “Let’s begin, then.”

Without any delay, Lin Yun gave Lil’ Purple the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute while he took out the Thunderstorm Zither.

“The Thunderstorm Zither?” Lil’ Purple was surprised looking at the Thunderstorm Zither.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Yun asked.

“You’re fortunate. The Thunderstorm Zither is a powerful zither. It might not be a Sovereign Saint Artifact, but it’s a rare ancient zither. The strings are all made of dragon veins, and the wood itself is made of a ten thousand-year-old Divine Dragon Wood. This genuine Ancient Divine Dragon Zither can play the sound of dragons and control thunderstorms with your fingers.” Lil’ Purple gently strummed the zither, creating sounds akin to rumbling thunder. Gently playing it, the surrounding wind gathered to form a dragon.

This greatly piqued her interest as she continued to play the zither. The zither music was accompanied by dragon roars. As Lil’ Purple became increasingly happy, she placed the zither down and said, “There’s actually a dragon soul within this zither!”

“Dragon soul?” Lin Yun asked, baffled.

“Every artifact is spiritual, but it’s tough to fuse a dragon soul into a zither. This is because most musical instruments are made with wood or jade, and you can’t engrave too many spiritual runes on them to maintain their purity. Without spiritual runes, it’s practically impossible for a soul to fuse into it.” Lil’ Purple explained. “Take this Divine Jade Bamboo Flute, for example. This is made with Divine Jade Bamboo. It might seem smooth, like jade, but it’s still bamboo. This rare piece is close to perfection but has no artifact spirit.”

Lin Yun was surprised because he didn’t think that there would be so much study for instruments.

“As for the Thunderstorm Zither, perhaps it was made with dragon wood, or this dragon wood already possessed a dragon soul before it was made into a zither.” Lil’ Purple shared her speculation. “Where did you get this zither from?”

“Big Brother Jiang gave this to me. This belonged to him.” Lin Yun said.

Stowing her smile, Lil’ Purple said, “It looks like you’re really fated with the Azure Dragon Lord. Perhaps he had already predicted this. Lin Yun, don’t let this zither down.”

“I naturally won’t.” Lin Yun replied.

“Let me test you. How many sounds are there to music?”

As Lin Yun caressed the zither, he soon played five notes with the zither and said, “There are five sounds in music - do, re, mi, so, and la.”

But he didn’t stop as he continued, “There are also 12 notes - unison, semitone, major second, minor third, major third, perfect fourth, tritone, perfect fifth, minor sixth, major sixth, minor seventh, and major seventh.”

Music was the sound of the instruments, and they were also the sound of the world. The former was an art, and the latter was dao. As the two combined, that was the music dao. Aside from that, the notes were still separated into Yin, Yang, and the five elements. Do, re, mi, so, and la represent Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth elements. The odd numbers of the twelve notes were Yang, and the even numbers were Yin.

The music dao was separated into the Noble, Saint, Imperial, and Divine Dragon Tones. The so-called “Divine Dragon” didn’t mean the actual divine dragon, but the ten divine beasts of the world who were born with the knowledge of music. Lil’ Purple was one, as she was born with the Divine Dragon Tone. Above that would be the legendary Celestial Tone.

“It looks like you didn’t forget what I taught you…” Lil’ Purple said. “But you’re not the same. Your sword intent was only at the Firmament Sword Intent, and the Noble Tone was enough. You’ll need the Saint Tone to wield the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent with music. So I want you to grasp the Saint Tone in ten days!”

Lin Yun was stunned when he heard that because this was a challenge, but he didn’t have a choice.
