Chapter 788 - Hot Blooded and No Regrets

Ji Feng struggled to stand up as his face paled. His eyes flashed coldly as he looked at Lin Yun with blood flowing down from his chest. “How much strength did you use?” he asked. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Ji Feng’s current state might seem terrible, but Lin Yun knew that Ji Feng only suffered superficial wounds. Although he was filled with reluctance, he wanted to know how much strength Lin Yun used. If Lin Yun also used 90% strength like him, then he might still have a chance to win.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun replied, “50%.”

When Ji Feng heard that, he narrowed his eyes and torrential rage surged in his heart because Lin Yun was actually humiliating him by saying that he only used 50% of his strength.

“Hmph, we’ll wait and see. It won’t be so easy to defeat me again in the third round.” Ji Feng snorted. Despite his reluctance, he knew that Lin Yun found his flaw and made him lose his composure. If he fought steadily, there was no way his flaw would have been exposed. He might have been able to exhaust Lin Yun into defeat.

Lin Yun muttered to himself, but he ultimately didn’t say a word after looking at Ji Feng’s dismal figure. He decided to keep things to himself. If they met in the ranking battle, he would be able to defeat Ji Feng even faster. Winning this battle wasn’t easy because he was hiding his strength. However, he revealed a lot of the Overlord Sword. Then again, it didn’t matter to him because his opponents still had to resolve the actual attack.

“Lin Yun wins!” The judge quickly collected himself and made the announcement. At this moment, all of the people in attendance sharply inhaled at this unbelievable event. They couldn’t believe that a newly risen genius from the Great Qin Empire would defeat Jue Chen of the seven elites.

Even more surprising was that Lin Yun won the fight gracefully. From the fight, they were able to tell that Lin Yun still had a few trump cards, which made him even more terrifying.

“How great! I never would have expected such a powerful sword technique.”

“Rather than saying it’s a victory for Lin Yun, it’s more like a victory for swordsmen. He has all the aspects of a true swordsman with his profound sword technique and unbelievable sword intent.”

“Indeed. I never thought that a swordsman could be so powerful. But did he really use only 50% of his strength?”

“It didn’t seem like it. But would anyone actually tell the truth on the stage? The banquet hasn’t ended, so he must be trying to fool his opponent.”

“This year’s banquet is very interesting. The competition for the title of the strongest swordsman in the Ancient Southern Domain will be fun to watch.” The audience felt their blood boil for the next round. Despite the odds, Lin Yun continued his undefeated streak and had given them a legendary performance.

“The Overlord Sword!” Nangong Wanyu and Li Mubai were surprised because they recognized Lin Yun’s sword technique. They knew it was one of the three strongest sword techniques that the Sword Sect possessed. However, it had disappeared for many years.

“There’s finally another swordsman after all these years.” Unlike the others, they were excited because there were too few genuine swordsmen.

“Ji Feng is the same as a piece of garbage!” Yan Long’zi’s face turned ugly after Ji Feng lost. After all, he basically slapped himself in the face when he claimed that Lin Yun would lose. Even worse, he dug a hole for himself because he stated this would happen multiple times. Unfortunately for him, the outcome was outside of his expectation.

The disciples of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion trembled as they smiled and flattered Yan Long’zi. As for Yue Weiwei, the concern on her face disappeared and she kicked back to relax. She stretched her waist charmingly and yawned while her eyes became little crescents.

Meanwhile, in the Great Qin Empire’s section, Pavilion Master Plum and the rest were completely dumbfounded. Was this really the Lin Yun they knew? But if this was a dream, they didn’t want to wake up.

As for the Indigomoon Elysium’s party, everyone wore an ugly expression.

This was the last round of battles for the elimination round and there weren't any interesting battles left. At the very least, nothing could follow Lin Yun and Ji Feng’s spectacular battle. So, everyone was already focusing on the ranking round.

“Zhu Qingfeng VS Liu Yunfei!” The judge’s sudden announcement piqued everyone’s interest. After all, Zhu Qingshan was a newly risen genius like Lin Yun who maintained his winning streak. After he revealed his strength, he didn’t hold back and killed over five people during the banquet.

Many people had given him the title ‘Demonic Blade’ because his saber technique was domineering and since he walked on the path of a demonic cultivator. Everyone even speculated that he was the secluded disciple of a famous demonic cultivator.

Liu Yunfei also wasn’t simple since he was ranked number twelve during the previous banquet. He was also the chief disciple of the Violet Thunder Sect. His prestige in the sect was second only to Zhao Wuji.

Standing on the stage, Liu Yunfei looked at Zhu Qingshan who had half of his face hidden in the shadows. As a newly risen genius, Zhu Qingshan had yet to suffer a loss in the banquet. On the other hand, Liu Yunfei had lost one round, but that was because he ran into Yan Long’zi.

So Liu Yunfei didn’t think too much about Zhu Qingshan because the strength Zhu Qingshan had shown so far wasn’t at the level of Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun was someone who defeated Ji Feng.

“You’re not strong enough. Aside from Zhao Wuji, no one from the Violet Thunder Sect is my opponent.” Zhu Qingshan spoke with a hoarse voice while his eyes goaded Liu Yunfei.

“Who do you think you are?!” Liu Yunfei’s eyes flashed with rage and he snorted angrily. His figure flickered, leaving behind purple afterimages that were enveloped by terrifying lightning. When he arrived in front of Zhu Qingshan, his afterimages combined to unleash a huge lightning bolt that soared into the sky.

“Violet Thunder Sky Connection!” A terrifying saber ray descended from the sky and lit up half of the horizon. The bright light from the exploding saber aura showed how powerful Liu Yunfei was.

Then, the two sabers collided and released countless sparks. The attacks were evenly matched. This made Lin Yun frown because Zhu Qingshan was stronger in his view. After all, Liu Yunfei used martial techniques, while Zhu Qingshan made a casual chop with his saber.

In order to achieve a conclusion, they would have to compete in saber intent. Both of them had xiantian saber intent, but the difference was based on their comprehension. Since it came down to a showdown of saber intent, Lin Yun was more optimistic of Zhu Qingshan winning.

The outcome was just as he had expected. Liu Yunfei lost after ten moves. Zhu Qingshan’s attack nearly severed him into two, which scared him into admitting defeat. When the battle ended, Zhu Qingshan looked at Lin Yun with an eerie gaze from under his hood.

Trying to intimidate me? Lin Yun could sense the provoking fighting spirits coming from Zhu Qingshan. After all, they were the two brightest underdogs and a battle between them was unavoidable.

Four hours later, the elimination round finally came to an end as the final ranking battle approached. There were only one hundred people who could make it into the ranking battle, which meant that everyone here was qualified for the Dragoncloud Ranking. All that was left was to get an actual rank.

As for the others, their journey in the banquet was at an end. It was a normal part of cultivation. One hundred thousand people participated in the banquet, but only a hundred made it to the final round. Simultaneously, people like Lin Yun, Bai Lixuan, and Zhu Qingshan would be remembered by the spectators. The banquet was a brutal trial of fire and blood to find the true dragons among the geniuses.
