Chapter 2478 - Lord of All Dragons

The Radiant Sword Emperor and Blade Emperor landed on the ceremonial stage, and this stage could withstand the fight between emperors.

The two exchanged a look with their blade intent and sword intent at the pinnacle ninth-grade. But the Blade Emperor’s blade intent was stronger than the Radiant Sword Emperor.

The blade intent and sword intent spread out and clashed. Shortly after, mythical phenomena began to appear around them. This made everyone look at them as though they were deities. To a certain degree, mythical emperors could be considered Deities. As long as the Heavenly Path was reforged, they could reach the Deity Realm at the fastest speed possible with no hindrance.

“Senior, what do you think?” Lin Yun looked at the White Emperor nervously. It wasn’t because he lacked confidence in his master, but the opponent was too strong.

“Your master can most likely win. As for the reason, I’ll tell you about it later,” the White Emperor replied.

“Among the nine of us, the Southern Emperor was the strongest. Back then, the Blade Emperor was second to the Southern Emperor. Do you know why?” the Blade Emperor asked.

Lin Yun was stumped. That Blade Emperor was that strong?

When Lin Yun looked over, the Blade Emperor explained, “Our inheritance came from the Iris Sword Saint, and that was also for the Blade Emperor. But the Iris Sword Saint is a swordsman. The inheritance as a bladesman came from the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity, and to a certain degree, he’s closer to the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity than us.”

When he heard that, Lin Yun came to his senses and remembered that the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity was a bladesman.

Right then, the Radiant Sword Emperor and Blade Emperor moved. When they clashed, ripples spread out in space that looked like overlapping phenomena. They could see two blurred figures radiating with radiance as they clashed. There were also two flowers blooming, representing two Eternal Daos.

The Radiant Sword Emperor and Blade Emperor grasped the Truth Dao, and it was fortunate that the foot of Mount Tai was sturdy, or it would’ve crumbled by now if they were somewhere else.

“Kill!” With a roar, the Blade Emperor radiated with crimson flames blazing in his eyes. When he roared, this increased the pressure on the Radiant Sword Emperor.

“Great Profound Sword Array!” The Radiant Sword Emperor soared with seven swords behind him, unleashing the full power of the completed Great Profound Sword Canon. When the sword array was activated, countless figures descended from the sky as the Radiant Sword Emperor swung his sword at the Blade Emperor.

The Blade Emperor raised his blade to block but was forced back.

“Myriad Swords Unite!” The Radiant Sword Emperor formed a seal as all the swords entered his body, forming a sword buzz. When the sword buzz echoed, the Blade Emperor instantly sensed something wasn’t right because even his soul trembled.

“Myriad Sword Bell!” The Radiant Sword Emperor continued to form a seal, and the swords formed a bell within his body, resonating with his internal organs. This made his internal organs resemble mountains and rivers, mimicking a small realm with the sword.

As the bell continued to ring, rippled spread out behind the Radiant Sword Emperor, and this left everyone dumbfounded because they had never expected such a bizarre secret technique in sword dao.

“This move gain...” The White Emperor smiled bitterly. “When I fought your master, I was tortured by this move because the saint origin, saint soul, and dao flowers are effected when the bell rings. Most importantly, the bell is hidden in the sword heart, and there’s no way to resolve it from the outside.”

The Blade Emperor’s seven orifices began to bleed under the bell, while the Radiant Sword Emperor’s Golden Emperor Physique began to shine brightly.

“Heart Shattering Form!” The Blade Emperor roared. Cracks appeared in his heart that soon spread out, and the pain allowed him to calm down. Under the intense pain, the Blade Emperor unleashed his full power and suppressed the bell's effect.

When he swung his blade from afar, the golden radiance on the Radiant Sword Emperor shattered. Most importantly, cracks appeared on his dao flower as it waned. But just when the Blade Emperor’s blade was about to land, the dao flower hidden in the Radiant Sword Emperor’s sword heart bloomed, and the ancient bell also formed into a golden bell.

The golden bell was covered with divine runes, intertwining with sword intent. When the blade landed on it, it only produced a deafening sound before the Blade Emperor was sent flying back. But the golden bell also shattered.

Then again, the bell in the Radiant Sword Emperor’s sword heart remained as blood dripped from his lips. But when the Radiant Sword Emperor raised his head, his sword aura began to climb.

“Great Profound Sword Array—Seven Swords Unite!” Blood splashed as the sword pierced through the Blade Emperor’s heart when he landed on the ground, looking as if time and space had overlapped.

When the Radiant Sword Emperor kept his sword and retreated a thousand feet away, he said coldly, “You lost.”

His sword naturally couldn’t kill the Blade Emperor, but the Blade Emperor’s dao flower exploded, and the phenomenon as a myth became dim. Many people didn’t expect the battle to end so quickly.

The Blade Emperor took a deep breath and said, “It looks like I have to address you as the Radiant Sword Emperor in the future.”

“Thanks for the fight,” the Radiant Sword Emperor replied.

“If the Heart Shattering Form reached the heartless stage, your Myriad Swords Bell definitely can’t block it,” the Blade Emperor said, unwilling to accept his loss.

“This is why I said the Blade Emperor would lose. He made no progress in the past three thousand years while your master has been under great pressure. Now that he received the title of Sword Emperor, how would your master lose to him?” the White Emperor said.

Lin Yun instantly understood that even myths could be shattered.

The Radiant Sword Emperor said, “The Heart Shattering Form is a trump card left behind by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity...but it’s a pity that I’ve never seen him before. I hope you won’t let his name down and bring the Heart Shattering Form to the pinnacle.”

“Since I’ve lost, I won’t stop the fight any longer. I also felt at ease after this battle,” the Blade Emperor smiled. The two cupped their fists before leaving.

The Empress was unconcerned with the Blade Emperor’s loss as if nothing was significant.

“Flower Burial, are you the one challenging today, or is it your master>?” The Golden Dragon King spoke out behind the Empress, looking at Lin Yun provocatively.

“Why don’t you give it a try?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Good! I’ve been waiting for that!” The Golden Dragon King laughed and dashed over.

The Empress didn’t hinder because Lin Yun would have no qualification to fight her if he couldn’t even defeat the Dragon Kings.

“Be careful. They’re no weaker than mythical emperors,” the White Emperor said.

Lin Yun nodded and landed on the stage. The Six Dragon Kings were only second to the Mythical Emperors in the Kunlun Realm. The Radiant Sword Emperor already gave everyone a great shock, and they wanted to know how Lin Yun as his disciple.

Each dragon king had a forte; the Golden Dragon King’s forte was his physique, and he also practiced the Imperial Dragon Fist.

“Thanks for your guidance!” Lin Yun cupped his fists together.

“There’s no guidance today. I want to see how powerful the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique is. Don’t be defeated by me, a Golden Dragon,” the Golden Dragon King looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile.

The Heavenly Dragon might be the lord of all dragons, but how would the seven divine dragons’ lineage submit to that? It would be a glorious mark in history if they could suppress Lin Yun, who possessed the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique.

The Golden Dragon King released his Golden Emperor Physique and descended before Lin Yun. The dragon aura and golden radiance he gave off caused heaven and earth to tremble, and this made many people’s soul tremble as well from the dragon aura.

Possessing the divine dragon bloodline, the Golden Dragon King’s Golden Emperor Physique was stronger than the Ice Emperor. When he threw a punch, a golden dragon flew out, radiating with great power before the punch even landed, looking as if the world had been distorted. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

But Lin Yun merely stood with one hand behind, caught the Golden Dragon King’s punch with his right hand, and twisted, reversing the distortion.

As the Golden Dragon King took three steps back, he looked at Lin Yun with shock. It felt like a dragon was coiling around Lin Yun, and that was the Sovereign Constellation summoned by the Heavenly Dragon’s authority. Under this authority, the Azure Dragon Constellation was under his control.

Looking at the Golden Dragon King, Lin Yun said, “Come!”

“What arrogance! The Heavenly Dragon is strong, but my divine dragon’s lineage isn’t weak!” The Golden Dragon King roared and performed the Imperial Dragon Fist, which was infinitely close to becoming a deity-grade martial technique.

When he threw his punch, Lin Yun continued to stand with one hand behind and faced the attack with the other hand. With a wave of his hand, his ever movement made him look like a grandmaster. Lin Yun laughed, raising his brow and seeing that the Golden Dragon King would finally use his trump card.

Taking a step forward, Lin Yun finally made a move with the Heavenly Dragon Bone shining behind him. As time was reversed, the Heavenly Dragon protected itself from Lin Yun upon sensing the Heavenly Dragon Bone.

The Heavenly Dragon’s aura coming from Lin Yun increased in the next second. Taking a step forward, Lin Yun also threw a punch that made the Golden Dragon King throw out blood from the impact.

Lin Yun raised his brow at the other dragon kings and said, “Don’t even bother facing the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique. The divine dragons are strong, but don’t forget that the Heavenly Dragon is the lord of all dragons!”
