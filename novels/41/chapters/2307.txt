Chapter 2308 - Everything Is Nothing Before Nirvana

The holy master’s response caught Lin Yun by surprise. He took a few steps back and asked, “Is it that important?”

The holy master was stunned and realized he had frightened Lin Yun. He smiled as his expression returned to normal, “That’s right. It doesn’t matter who taught you as long as you know this sword technique.”

Lin Yun immediately felt that there was something strange about the holy master. He couldn’t tell him who taught the Nirvana Sword Art to him. It was taught to him by the Iris Sword Saint, but not personally. He comprehended most of it, and the Sword of the Beginning derived from the Nirvana Sword Art. This was Lin Yun’s greatest secret, and he wasn’t sure if the holy master had connected it with the Iris Sword Saint. He wasn’t sure if it was good or bad for him.

As Lin Yun’s face changed, he briefly pondered before he asked, “Why don’t we stop it here?”

“No can do. I’m just getting started. Use this sword technique again while I defend,” the holy master smiled with his interest piqued. He previously wanted Lin Yun to leave but didn’t want Lin Yun to leave now.

“It’s fine. He won’t harm you,” Lil’ Purple sighed.

Lin Yun had a feeling that there was a hidden meaning in Lil’ Purple’s words. But her words dispelled his concern, and he smiled, “Sure.”

It was hard to find such an opponent, and he could improve in the Nirvana Sword Art while facing the Sacred Radiance Sword Lord. When they clashed again, Lin Yun purely used the Nirvana Sword Art.

Since the holy master had experienced it before, he dealt with it more easily this time. Furthermore, Lin Yun discovered that the changes in speed by the holy master also became tricky. There seemed to be something similar between it and his Nirvana Sword Art, but it was also different.

Lin Yun could feel that the holy master was holding back, but he could feel that the potential of his sword technique was higher than the Scarlet Radiance Sword Lord. This wasn’t just a spar but more like guidance instead. When he performed the Nirvana of the Beginning again, the feeling from earlier didn’t show up again.

“There’s no need to hurry. Your sword isn’t just going back in time; you have to think more about it. You also have to consider the changes of time and space.” The holy master blocked the sword and continued, “You have to think more. So it’s normal that your sword technique isn’t stable yet, as you’ve just entered the threshold.”

Lin Yun was surprised, and asked, “How do you know about that?”

“Why wouldn’t I know about it?” The holy master smiled, “Have you ever thought about why your sword intent couldn’t suppress me? Is it just because I control more saint daos? Think more about it.”

The holy master pointed at his head, and smiled, “Carry on!”

As they fought, the holy master would guide him whenever he had a doubt. But the holy master didn’t directly feed it to him, but made him think. When everything came to an end, Lin Yun performed the Nirvana of the Beginning ten times, but only succeeded three times and failed seven times.

He had a high odds of failure, but this was a huge transformation to Lin Yun. When he practiced it by himself, he only succeeded once and failed every other attempt.

“The sun is rising, so you can go back and think,” the holy master smiled before disappearing.

Lin Yun took a deep breath. He still had many doubts. When he returned to the Stream Cloud Residence, the sun had already risen to the sky with the Astral River Saint Sovereign waiting there with another huge gift.

“Isn’t… this too much?” Lin Yun was surprised. He could accept it the first time but felt that something wasn’t right now. He asked, “Astral River Saint Sovereign, the holy master isn’t going to make me his son-in-law, right?”

Looking at Lin Yun’s serious expression, the Astral River Saint Sovereign laughed, “You really know how to speculate. Just take them. You deserve them. If you don’t accept them, the holy master will come after me.”

The Astral River Saint Sovereign patted Lin Yun’s shoulder, and said, “The holy master will meet you six days from now.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up. He didn’t forget that he was here to seek help from the Divine Phoenix Mountain. Furthermore, this could only be decided by the holy master.

“Empress, did you sense something? Why did you say that he won’t harm me?” Lin Yun entered the Iris Secret Realm and asked after the Astral River Saint Sovereign left.

Lil’ Purple sighed, “Some things cannot be avoided. You will know in a few days. So you can accept those resources. Don’t forget to give me some Divine Phoenix Fruits and Divine Phoenix Pellets.”

“Here.” Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to share the Divine Phoenix Fruits and Divine Phoenix Pellets with her.

After receiving them, Lil’ Purple happily gave Lin Yun a peck on his cheek, “Hehe! Thank you!”

She ran after she was done speaking, and Lin Yun helplessly shook his head.

The Aquatic Shore Residence was the nearest floating island to the divine mountain and was where Ji Zixi resided. Today, Ji Zixi dressed well, wearing a flaming robe with golden threads that outlined her perfect figure, making her look noble, and she wore a crown similar to the holy master.

After the holy master bade farewell to Lin Yun, he rushed over and dismissed the maids. Looking at Ji Zixi, who was facing the mirror, the holy master wore a doting expression and smiled, “Are you nervous?”

When Ji Zixi turned around and saw the holy master’s injury, her face changed. She asked, “Father, what happened?”

“Your lover caused it,” the holy master said as he sat down.

Ji Zixi was surprised, and asked, “How can he possibly injure you?”

The holy master smiled and explained what happened. After hearing what the holy master said, Ji Zixi smiled, “Big Brother Lin is really the strongest prodigy swordsman in the past and the next five hundred years.”

The holy master pretended to be angry and smiled, “What’s the matter? You’re no longer worried about your father’s injury?”

“Father is the best, and this is nothing for you.” Ji Zixi massaged the holy master’s back, and said, “Father, you have to guide Big Brother Lin well.”

“Hahaha!” The holy master laughed, “You’re not even hiding it now. Well, that’s nothing because I took a liking to him as well.”

The Astral River Saint Sovereign and Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign came in right then. After they bowed, the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign said, “Holy Master, the ceremony is starting soon.”

The holy master’s smile disappeared, and he told Ji Zixi, “You’re a genius, whether it's in terms of your aptitude or talent, it's just that you’re a little too young.”

Ji Zixi smiled, “Don’t worry about it. I believe that I can successfully grasp the Divine Phoenix Physique.”

“The moment the divine physique appears, you will become the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden. You will bear the responsibility as one,” the holy master said.

“I know,” Ji Zixi replied.

“The ceremony is dangerous, but there’s no risk, thanks to the divine flame fragment. There might even be a chance for you to reach the level of natal divine physique,” the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign said.

The holy master sent the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign and Ji Zixi off. After they left, the Astral River Saint Sovereign asked, “Holy Master, the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign is here.”

The holy master’s facial expression became grave, and he said, “Bring him to the main hall. I’ll go over after cleaning myself up.”

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign was someone from the Sacred Alliance, a guest that he invited over. That's why he naturally had to be in proper clothing.

An hour later, the holy master appeared before the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign.

Since the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign was a junior and weaker in cultivation, he bowed, “I pay my respect to the holy master.”

“Saint Sovereign, you’re being too polite.” The holy master smiled, “You’re a guest of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, so you don’t have to bother with the etiquette.”

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign said, “Holy master if you want to understand Flower Burial through me, I’m afraid you will be disappointed.”

“What do you mean?” The holy master asked.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign didn’t hide it, since he only had a few meetings with Lin Yun when the latter defeated Huang Xuanyi, telling Lin Yun that the Sacred Alliance was paying attention to him and didn’t interact anymore. The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign joked, “Perhaps he has already forgotten about me.”

That was possible since he was a Saint Lord back then, but he had become a Saint Sovereign now. Not to mention that a few years have passed. The holy master smiled, “I heard that the Sacred Alliance helped Lin Yun on the Heavenly Path, which can be considered a huge grace. So how could he forget about you?”

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign merely smiled and said nothing else.

“I didn’t call you over for that.” The holy master’s expression became grave, before he continued, “After the Dragon’s Gate was dispersed, many forces willing to follow the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity formed the Sacred Alliance, maintaining a neutral position. Do you still remember the Sacred Alliance’s oath from the past? About protecting the Kunlun Realm and reforging the Heavenly Path.”

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign’s face became serious, and he said, “That’s for sure. When Lin Yun became the strongest champion of the nine heavenly paths, everyone knew he would be a formidable figure when he grew up. This is also why we stopped the Profound Sky Sect from making a move against him. We have also been paying attention to him throughout the years, along with other geniuses. The Sacred Alliance was shocked about the battle outside the God Burial Mountain Range. Even if you didn’t write me a letter, I would have visited him.”

The holy master’s expression eased, and he smiled, “That’s good. The Sacred Alliance can choose to place the stake now. If anyone can reforge the Heavenly Path, it will be Lin Yun. He will be able to do what the Nine Emperors couldn’t.”

The holy master spoke with confidence that shocked the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign. After all, this person was the holy master of the Divine Phoenix Mountain and was invincible beneath the Emperor Realm. So, words coming from him couldn’t be taken as a joke.

“He might become comparable to the Nine Emperors,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign said with uncertainty. “I might have high hopes for him. The Southern Emperor was unrivalled back then, but there’s still Yu Qingfeng, if we’re talking about sword dao.”

With a helpless expression, the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign continued, “After the Southern Emperor left, Yu Qingfeng had intentions of reforging the Heavenly Path, but he failed.”

The holy master raised his cup of tea and took a sip before he continued, “Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign, have you heard of the Sword Saint who could slay deities in ancient times?”

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign was briefly stunned, with his face changing. He asked in a trembling tone, “You’re saying…?”

The holy master nodded, “Space is sovereign, time is king, karma is unpredictable, primal chaos is unfathomable, truth is eternal, yin-yang is the sky, five elements are the earth… but everything is nothing before Nirvana. It doesn’t matter if Lin Yun is related to the Iris Sword Saint, he has already stepped on the path of Nirvana Dao.”

“H-How is that possible?!” The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign was shocked. Nirvana Dao was terrifying; only two people have grasped it since the beginning of the Divine Dragon Era. One was the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity, and the second was the Iris Sword Saint. Can it be that the third person is going to appear?

He was so shocked that his hand trembled and spilled the tea in the cup.
