Chapter 624 - Meeting the Empyrean

Lin Yun had emerged out of tens of thousands of people, which displayed how brutal the martial world was. Countless disciples came from countless sects to search for treasures. Everyone was ambitious, but only one would be the victor. Even though there was only one victor, most of the disciples had left the empyrean’s tomb with some kind of harvest.

But to those in the top ten of the outer ranking like Ji Wuye, the treasures of the tomb weren’t attractive. Their only goals were the Astral Pearl and the empyrean’s legacy.

Ji Wuye had practically slaughtered his way through the participants and imprinted the name of the Bloody Butcher in everyone’s heart. Although he came for the Astral Pearl with confidence, he still lost to Lin Yun in the end. This wasn’t something that he could accept, but there was nothing he could do to change the outcome.

As Ji Wuye gradually disappeared from the lake, he stared at Lin Yun with endless rage in his eyes. “I’ll definitely repay this humiliation a hundred fold in the future!”

However, Lin Yun didn’t seem bothered by those words. He had heard similar speeches countless times from those he had defeated, but none of them managed to do it. After all, his pride didn’t allow him to lose to someone he had defeated. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

This battle might be tough, but this wasn’t Lin Yun’s limit. After all, he managed to keep the xiantian sword intent at complete mastery and the Dustlight Sword Art hidden. He wasn’t like Ji Wuye who had a powerful sect to back him up and he could only rely on himself.

The Heavenly Province Academy wasn’t the Sword Firmament Pavilion that could protect him regardless of anything. So he had to keep as many trump cards hidden as possible in this brutal world.

At the border of the Withernorth Sea, everyone watched as the most dazzling star in the starry sky descended. Everyone knew that it was the empyrean’s Astral Pearl that would soon fall into Lin Yun’s hands.

As that star descended, light began to appear once more as the darkness receded. When the star fully descended, the starry sky also disappeared. Then, everything disappeared as if it was all a dream.

Right at this moment, a figure fell onto the ground and caused a cloud of sand to rise. When that figure stood up with great difficulty, everyone’s faces changed. The figure was Ji Wuye, which meant that the outcome was determined.

Everyone narrowed their eyes as they looked at Ji Wuye and sighed. Right at this moment, no one suspected the reality of what they saw previously. When they saw Lin Yun defeating Ji Wuye, they only pitied him. Ji Wuye clearly held a great advantage, but he still lost to Lin Yun who came from the Great Qin Empire.

He was ranked third on the outer ranking and there were only two people who could defeat him on the outer ranking. However, today there was one more person who had that ability. Lin Yun’s achievement represented the replacement of the old generation. His actions were like tossing a huge rock into a calm lake.

Everyone knew the consequences of this ripple that could change the sky. There were still eight months until the Draconic Banquet and it would be exciting since others like Lin Yun would rise up.

“He won!” The Heavenly Province Academy cheered when they saw Ji Wuye. No matter what, Lin Yun was still a guest deacon of their academy, so this would bring them fame. Not to mention that Mo Ling and the rest had a deep friendship with Lin Yun. So even if Lin Yun wasn’t part of the academy, they would still feel happy for him.

“How terrifying...he actually defeated Ji Wuye…” Zhang Yuan looked at the sky with admiration in his eyes. He had no choice but to admire Lin Yun. He knew how terrifying Ji Wuye was. After all, there weren’t many core disciples in the Heavenly Sword Sect that could defeat Ji Wuye.

He had also experienced how arrogant Ji Wuye was. Ji Wuye was someone that didn’t even place the Heavenly Sword Sect’s disciples in his eyes. But it was a pity that he lost terribly this time.

“I believe that the name of Flower Burial will spread like wildfire.” Tang Yu nodded his head with a smile from the surrounding cheers. Ji Wuye was ranked third on the outer ranking. So it was natural that Lin Yun would rise to fame after defeating him.

“That fellow…” Compared to them, those from the Bloodwing Pavilion all had a ugly expression.

“Ji Wuye actually lost…”

“No wonder Senior Brother Leng was slain by him.”

“Who still remembers senior brother’s death now? They’re all talking about what a genius Lin Yun is and how senior brother became his stepping stone…” The Bloodwing Pavilion’s disciples sighed.

As for the Heavenly Soul Realm expert, his face was dark with killing intent surging in his eyes. As Leng Haoyu’s master, there was no way he could take this lying down. After a long while later, he said with his teeth gritted, “This brat from the Great Qin Empire dares to kill a disciple of my Bloodwing Pavilion. He has to die no matter what, even if Tang Yu tries to stop us.”

One of the three other elders was briefly stunned before he nodded his head in agreement, “Don’t worry about it. We’re more than enough to deal with him.”

The Withernorth Sea was in the boundaries of the Nether Prefecture. As a quasi-overlord force in the Nether Prefectural City, they would be thoroughly embarrassed if they couldn’t even deal with someone from the Great Qin Empire.

Back in the empyrean’s tomb, Lin Yun still had no idea of the great commotion he had caused. Instead, he was looking at the bright star hovering in the sky. More accurately speaking, it was the Astral Pearl. This was something that everyone on the Dragoncloud Ranking yearned for since it could upgrade the martial soul.

Those in the inner ranking all had their martial souls upgraded to the eighth profound grade before making a breakthrough into the Yin-Yang stage. As for Lin Yun, he had two martial souls, the Aurora Dragon and Qiongqi that were barely at the first profound grade.

Although the two martial souls had been absorbing the origin energy in his violet palace, there wasn’t any clear evidence of improvement. There was nothing Lin Yun could do about it as it wasn’t easy upgrading one’s martial soul, even for those geniuses from the quasi-overlord forces.

Lin Yun was all by himself, which meant that the resources he could obtain were less valuable than Ji Wuye. This made upgrading his martial souls even more difficult. But this Astral Pearl would change everything.

He had obtained the Profound Yin Water and refined the Infernal Flower on this trip in the Withernorth Sea, making his breakthrough to the greater Yang stage. Furthermore, he obtained the Azure Dragon Enneaform, an ancient cosmic artifact, and an Azure Dragon’s blood essence. With the addition of the Astral Pearl, his trip was more perfect than he could have imagined.

Before coming here, Lin Yun never imagined that he would have such a huge harvest in the empyrean’s tomb. Then again, opportunities were left to people who were prepared and his training in the academy for the past three months had paid off.

Lin Yun tried waving his hand to bring the Astral Pearl over, but the Astral Pearl didn’t move, which made Lin Yun frown.

“Hmmm?” But just when he was feeling baffled, light began to gather and form into the outline of an old man. Lin Yun was surprised by this scene, but he soon calmed himself down. If he had guessed correctly, the old man should be the owner of this empyrean’s tomb. But even if Lin Yun had maintained his composure, he still couldn’t help being shocked as he was facing an ancient empyrean.

“Greetings, senior. May I know how to address you?” Lin Yun asked with his hands cupped together to show his respect.

“There’s no need for you to know the name of a deceased person, not to mention that I’m not a powerhouse. I’m very inferior to the lord you met in the past…” The empyrean smiled as he examined Lin Yun.

That lord? Countless thoughts flashed in Lin Yun’s mind before he probed, “Are you speaking about Senior Iris Sword Saint…?”

“People like me can’t use his name directly.” The empyrean nodded his head carefully.

Lin Yun was shocked. He knew that the Iris Sword Saint came from the golden era and was a powerhouse during that time. However, he never imagined that even an empyrean wouldn’t dare to say his name directly. But now that he thought about it, it made sense because the Iris Sword Saint had quite the temper. After all, he was very picky about who obtained his inheritance.
