Chapter 1887 - Stand Out

Luo Cheng was defeated before he could even unleash his attack. Those who belittled Ye Qingtian and thought he cowered against Luo Cheng’s challenge earlier were dumbfounded.

All the saint disciples waiting to be conferred on the stage were wearing grave expressions. Those who were initially looking at Ye Qingtian with disdain were stunned.

“That fellow hid his strength?”

“His sword aura is too powerful. His cultivation is lower than Luo Cheng, but he managed to suppress the latter entirely based on his aura.”

Seeing that no one dared to stand out this time, Lin Yun grinned, “I seemed to have been a little too heavy on him. Saint Elder, are you lying to me? It looks like there aren’t many who reported to you last night.”

He might sound like he’s exclaiming, but his tone was filled with provocation directed at Saint Elder. At this moment, everyone gritted their teeth upon seeing the smile on Ye Qingtian’s face.

“A formidable figure finally appeared from the Indigo Thunder Peak. Indigo Thunder Peak’s Peak Master, is he personally taught by you?” Saint Elder turned to the Indigo Thunder Peak’s Peak Master.

The face of the Indigo Thunder Peak’s Peak Master froze, and he didn’t dare to answer. He looked at Lin Yun and roared, “Ye Qingtian, watch your tone when you speak to Saint Elder. I’ll give you a tight slap if you dare to be disrespectful.”

After reprimanding Lin Yun, he smiled, “But Saint Elder, what he said is true because no one else stood out. The fact that he can defeat Luo Cheng means he qualifies to become a saint disciple. Why don’t we end this matter here?”

The Wind Origin Quasi-Saint was unhappy but didn’t say anything about it. After all, strength matters everywhere you go, and even an idiot could tell that Ye Qingtian qualified to become a saint disciple.

Saint Elder didn’t reply to Lin Yun. He naturally wouldn’t lower himself to Lin Yun’s level, but his attitude changed as he realized that Lin Yun was an excellent sapling. He asked, “Since the Indigo Thunder Peak’s Peak Master already said it this way, we’ll end this matter here, then. Ye Qingtian, I won’t hold your past against you now.”

“Saint Elder, why didn’t you ask if I wanted to pursue this matter?” Lin Yun asked.

The surroundings fell silent when they heard what Ye Qingtian said and even wondered if Ye Qingtian had gone insane.

“How do you want to pursue this matter, then?” the Saint Elder asked.

“Didn’t Saint Elder say that many people reported to you? So I’d like to ask where they are!” Lin Yun said, fearlessly looking at Saint Elder. The surroundings fell silent because they never expected that Ye Qingtian would be so overbearing.

“Ye Qingtian, we’ll fulfill your wish since you want to be humiliated!” Three figures stood out from the crowd, looking at Lin Yun. They all wore the Dao Yang Palace uniform and were all at the fourth channel of the Profound Death Stage, giving off an immense aura. When they stood together, their auras even connected and became one.

“Zhang Xun!”

“Cao Zijing!”

“Wang He!”

The three reported their names, and it immediately caused an uproar. The three of them were top-tiered geniuses of the Dao Yang Palace, and they were ranked within the top ten inside of the Dao Yang Palace when they were still inner disciples.

Seeing the three of them stand out, many people breathed a sigh of relief because they could easily suppress Ye Qingtian with their strength.

“You haven’t changed at all. We’re the ones who reported to him last night. So what can you do to us?” Zhang Xun provoked.

“Don’t tell me you don’t dare to say it to our faces?”

“We couldn’t be bothered about you earlier. Did you think that you’re somebody?” Wang He looked at Lin Yun with a provocating smile.

Hearing what they said, Lin Yun smiled, “I never once said that I’m someone. But anyone is qualified to say what I said earlier, even an ant. Since Saint Elder could say them, I naturally could too.”

Lin Yun briefly paused before he continued in a lazy tone, “You guys can come at me together so that you can’t claim that I bullied you later on.”

The moment he said that, the three disciples from the Dao Yang Palace released powerful sword auras, instantly making the surrounding atmosphere intense. Everyone could sense that those three were genuinely furious, and no one from the Dao Yang Palace was a pushover. After all, no one dared to offend them, usually aside from the Heavenly Yin Palace and three courtyards.

“It appears you’ve forgotten how you begged Senior Brother Zhang for mercy back then.” Cao Zijing made the first move and unleashed a dazzling sword ray. The sword ray he gave off was dazzling, and it instantly arrived before Lin Yun.

This made many people take in a breath because of the sheer speed. Everyone noticed that Cao Zijing was purposely trying to show off, especially after seeing how Lin Yun suppressed Luo Cheng with his aura.

His attack was fast, but it disappeared even faster. When Lin Yun raised his hand, the sword ray around Cao Zijing disappeared. When Lin Yun grasped his hand, all the sword rays gathered in his palm.

“It’s this move again!” Bai Shuying was inwardly alarmed because Lin Yun had used it half a month ago. But even this time, she still couldn’t see through anything. She could only tell that it had something to do with Thunderstorm Intent. It might be a secret technique, but she couldn’t tell anything else.

“Here, you can have it back.” Lin Yun smiled and opened his hand.

Before Cao Zijing could catch a clear view, he was sent flying by his sword intent and threw out blood when he fell to the ground. He couldn’t believe that his sword aura was returned to him several fold, and his face became pale.

This was an outcome that no one had expected. Even if Cao Zijing had underestimated his opponent, it made no sense for him to lose so terribly. Zhang Xun and Wang He’s faces were covered with shock when they looked at Lin Yun again.

“Who do you guys think you are to report me? Do you think I really care about a bunch of garbage like you guys? I’m here to beat people up. Since I can’t beat up a Saint, I’ll beat you people up!” Lin Yun became furious with his hair wildly fluttering in the wind.

Before anyone could respond, Lin Yun spread his arms apart and dashed towards the trio with a massive pressure being emitted from him, forcing the trio to unleash their martial techniques. The four soon fought together, with dragon origin and sword rays splashing around.

The trio already used their full strength, aside from their constellations, but their attacks were easily resolved by Lin Yun.

“Go down!” Lin Yun limited his sword intent in the Firmament Sword Intent before releasing it, instantly causing the trio to throw out a mouthful of blood. He waved his hand and swept the trio out before commenting, “The Dao Yang Palace? Doesn’t look so impressive after all.”

“Complete mastery of the Firmament Sword Intent!”

“No, it has already reached the Manifestation Stage. He’s only one step away from achieving the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent!”

“How did he manage to do it?” An uproar rose from the surroundings as they looked at Ye Qingtian with disbelief. After all, someone who could bring the Firmament Sword Intent to this level before twenty-five could be considered a top-tiered genius within the Heavenly Dao Sect. It wasn’t an understatement to call him a genius swordsman.

They couldn’t imagine the term ‘genius swordsman’ could be connected to Ye Qingtian since the contrast was too huge. This scene gave everyone who looked down on Ye Qingtian a resounding slap to their faces, and they knew that Ye Qingtian had risen.

He had cleansed all the humiliation the Dao Yang Palace gave him, defeating three promising geniuses of the Dao Yang Palace alone.

“Ye Qingtian, do you think the Dao Yang Palace has no one?” A cold snort resounded, and a slender figure walked out from the Dao Yang Palace’s party, donning a black robe.

“Chen Jun is going to make a move!” An uproar came from the crowd. Chen Jun was a famous genius in the sword in recent years, and his sword intent had already reached the pinnacle of the Firmament Sword Intent when he was at the Dragon Pulse Realm. It wasn’t an underestimation to call him a rising star of the Dao Yang Palace to grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent before the Nirvana Stage. Furthermore, he was only twenty-three this year.

Bai Shuying’s expression changed. Chen Jun was prideful, and he couldn’t even be bothered by Ye Qingtian in the past.

As Chen Jun walked forth, he was enveloped by a dazzling sword ray. “Your sword intent is surprising, but it’s nothing in my eyes.”

The heavens suddenly shattered, and no one had expected that Chen Jun’s sword intent had already reached the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

“Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at twenty-three. It’s no wonder why he’s the rising star of the Dao Yang Palace.”

“Junior Brother Chen Jun really keeps a low profile.”

“This is a true genius, not like Ye Qingtian. Ye Qingtian is nothing compared to Chen Jun!”

“Yeah, he was really arrogant earlier. Now, he’ll know he’s just a frog in a well!” Those who were previously unhappy with Ye Qingtian became excited because they could finally vent their emotions.

“You still have time to admit defeat now. Otherwise, I’m afraid that I’ll cripple you again. You can’t imagine how powerful the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent is. I can easily kill you with a slap,” Chen Jun said coldly. To achieve the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at twenty-three, he naturally qualified to be prideful.

“Why don’t you give it a try, then?” Lin Yun tugged his arms together and wore a playful smile. But in the eyes of others, his smile was filled with arrogance.

“Junior Brother Chen, kill him!”

“Kill him!”

“Kill that lecher!” Voices echoed across the plaza.

“As you wish,” Chen Jun said, pushing his palm forth. This might seem like a simple palm, but it contained a massive sword aura.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

But Lin Yun merely stood there, and Chen Jun threw out a mouthful of blood and took several steps back instead. Chen Jun’s face was covered with shock, and he couldn’t comprehend what had just happened.

Lin Yun had his eyes closed and his hair fluttering in the wind as if a breeze was blown. He opened his eyes and smiled, “Are you done? It’s my turn, then!”

When Lin Yun pushed his palm forth, Chen Jun’s Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent shattered, and he was sent flying away. Lin Yun was radiating with the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. Paired with his handsome looks, even men had to admit he was a little too good-looking.

Everything happened too quickly, and it ended when Lin Yun released his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. He said, “I initially plan to maintain a low-profile upon returning to the Heavenly Dao Sect, but it appears that my strength doesn’t allow me to do so.”

Before anyone could react, Lin Yun raised his head and roared, “Any more reporters? Stand out!”

This time, no one dared to say a word about it.
