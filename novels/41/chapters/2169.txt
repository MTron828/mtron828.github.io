Chapter 2170: Dao Comprehending Stage

Lin Yun’s smile disappeared. Then he said with a grave expression, “Even Senior Brother thinks that he’s an unparalleled genius?”

Ye Guhan smiled, “My thoughts don't matter because he is a publicly recognized genius. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to compete with Great Saints in just five hundred years. Five hundred years wasn’t the same as now. The spiritual energy hadn’t fully awakened yet, and there weren’t as many treasures in the world.”

Lin Yun was surprised as he asked, “Is there a difference?”

“Of course, there’s a difference,” Ye Guhan said sternly. “A prosperous era has arrived. In the past, no matter how powerful a genius was, it was hard for them to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm in just a hundred years, but it is normal now. This is because the spiritual energy in the world has changed, speeding up everyone’s cultivation speed. The second reason is because more treasures are being born throughout the world, such as the Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses. There are more opportunities in the world now. It’s becoming more like the Golden Era from ancient times, and we may even see a Saint Lord at a hundred years old or even fifty years old.”

Ye Guhan continued, “The appearance of the Blue Dragon Record means that a prosperous era will arrive, and it will give birth to many monstrous geniuses. Martial cultivation will circulate between prosperity and decline, but the prosperous era has been brought ahead…”

“Brought ahead?” Lin Yun was baffled.

“There’s a form of saying. 'When the Kunlun Realm’s Heavenly Dao senses danger, it will speed up the arrival of a prosperous era to withstand the chaos'. This is a form of instinct of the Heavenly Dao,” Ye Guhan said.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he heard of that saying before. Senior Tian Xing spoke of it before that the arrival of a prosperous era would usually be accompanied with chaos. This era would be gorgeous and exciting, a stage for heroes. But it was also a tragic era since many people could lose their lives.

“I’ll bring you to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. Your cultivation is a little low, and you’ll need three days before you get your rewards,” Ye Guhan called out to Lin Yun just as they left the Dao Yang Mountain. Lin Yun was prepared to return to the Indigothunder Peak. He continued, “Three days in the outside world is roughly two years in the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. It’s enough for you to comprehend dao and increase your cultivation to the Indigo Origin Phase.”

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t refuse that. But not long after they walked, a young man donning an azure robe was walking in their direction. This person looked elegant with an amicable smile, and he paid his respects to Ye Guhan. “I pay my greetings to the Azure River Sword Saint.”

“Holy Spirit Son, you’ve ended your seclusion?” Ye Guhan stopped as he recognized this person.

The Holy Spirit Son? Lin Yun looked at this young man woth curiosity. He had long heard of the Holy Spirit Son, the Holy Son of the Holy Spirit Courtyard. The Heavenly Dao Sect had two palaces, three courtyards, and seventy-two peaks. The three courtyards were the Profound Maiden Courtyard, Nether Orchid Courtyard, and the Holy Spirit Courtyard.

The Holy Spirit Courtyard was extremely mysterious and proficient in spiritual runes. There were rumors that the Holy Spirit Courtyard had many treasured lands. They were mysterious, and rarely interacted with the outside world.

The Holy Spirit Son had been in seclusion, and there were rumors that his attainment in spiritual runes had reached an unbelievable height. He became a holy son at the age of sixteen, and Lin Yun heard rumors about him before, but he didn’t have an opportunity to meet him.

“Not exactly. The Thousand Plume Great Saint called for me to make a trip to the Dao Yang Palace. I didn’t expect to run into the Azure River Sword Saint along the way,” the Holy Spirit Son smiled. He looked at Lin Yun, and said, “This should be the Heavenly Dragon Lord, Ye Qingtian, right? I’ve heard of rumors about you in the Holy Spirit Clan. You're truly extraordinary now that I look at you.”

“You flatter me too much.” Lin Yun would naturally respond with politeness since the Holy Spirit Son was polite to him.

“I’ll get going first.” The Holy Spirit Son nodded and left.

Looking at his figure, Lin Yun squinted and focused his sword intent into his eyes. He suddenly saw the Holy Spirit Son shining brightly with saint radiance intertwining around him, making him look like a bright sun. Lin Yun’s face changed as he dismissed the sword intent in his eyes, and the latter instantly looked like an ordinary person.

“He’s very mysterious. Even his body seems like it’s constructed with saint runes, and I can’t determine his cultivation,” Lin Yun asked in a shocked tone.

Ye Guhan said, “His cultivation isn’t high. He’s only at the pinnacle of the Samsara Edict Realm, but he has a terrifying attainment in spiritual runes. He wouldn’t even fear a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase, and he’s stronger than you in this factor.”

“The Heavenly Origin Phase’s Quasi-Saint is that strong?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s for sure,” Ye Guhan replied. “The Heavenly Origin Phase can be considered a partial saint, and there are three stages in it. The first is the Saint Flame Stage, which is to manifest your sacred flame to temper your saint aura, allowing your saint aura to undergo a transformation. The sacred flame can transform thirty-six times, and it would be more powerful each time. Just the thirty-six layers of pressure isn’t something someone at the Indigo Origin Phase could withstand.”

Lin Yun knew that a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase was terrifying, but he didn’t imagine that it could easily crush any Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase. He asked, “Why is the Holy Spirit Son fearless even when facing a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase?”

“He has comprehended an ancient saint diagram, refining a divine rune in his profound palace. Although he hasn’t gained complete control of it, he could easily withstand the heavenly pressure.” Ye Guhan was filled with praises for the Holy Spirit Son, and said, “Then again, he’s patient enough since he spent ten years comprehending that ancient saint diagram. The Thousand Plume Great Saint said that he might become the youngest Heavenly Spiritualist within the Eastern Desolation.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Lin Yun smacked his lips upon hearing that. He had practiced spiritual runes before, and knew how to draw spiritual diagrams. So he naturally knew how boring the process was, and a saint diagram would only become more complex. Not only was it complex, one would feel a headache if they looked at it for too long. In a nutshell, the Holy Spirit Son couldn’t be underestimated.

When the two walked far away, the Holy Spirit Son turned around, looked at Lin Yun’s figure and muttered, “So, that is Ye Qingtian? He doesn’t look like the rumors.”

Ye Guhan brought Lin Yun to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. This wasn’t Lin Yun’s first time here. The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda wasn’t only a time-space treasure, there were many martial techniques kept in it along with various treasures. The only one guarding the pagoda was the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord. When Ye Guhan brought Lin Yun over, the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord didn’t dare to neglect them.

“Mhm? There’s someone on the seventh level?” Ye Guhan asked in surprise as he noticed something. The first three levels of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda were used to store treasures, the fourth and fifth levels were the time-space secret realms, and the seventh level was the core secret realm. Even a holy son and holy maiden couldn’t enter the seventh level.

Heavenly Yi Saint Lord explained, “Wang Muyan is inside. The Heavenly Yin Great Saint personally brought her in, and she had passed the test of the artifact spirit. So it’s according to the rules.”

“Does the Wang Clan really think that the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda belongs to them?” Ye Guhan muttered. The seventh level required divine crystals to activate. The flow of time inside was even slower, and the spiritual energy in there was denser, not to mention one could use the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda to comprehend saint dao.

Even Ye Guhan could only bring Lin Yun, who wasn’t a holy son, to the fifth level. So this naturally made Ye Guhan unhappy.

The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord smiled awkwardly, but didn’t dare to pick up that topic.

The group of three came to the fifth level of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. The spiritual energy here was dense, and saint elixirs could be seen everywhere along with spiritual beasts. This was no different from a small realm.

Lin Yun was amazed as he looked around. If the Iris Secret Realm could operate fully, it might also have the same function. At the center of the secret realm, there was a massive stage with many palm-sized pagodas hovering around it that released a dazzling saint radiance.

“This is the Dao Comprehending Stage. Those pagodas not only connect to the starry sky beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven, but there are many sword spirits around. Ye Qingtian, you have to thank the Azure River Sword Saint well,” the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord smiled. “Even a holy son can’t step on the Dao Comprehending Stage whenever they want.”

Lin Yun had long noticed that the Dao Comprehending Stage was extraordinary, and there were many saint daos around the stage flowing like rivers.

“The flow of time here is slow, and a day here is equivalent to six months to the outside world,” Ye Guhan said. He continued, “You don’t have to be in a hurry to reach the Indigo Origin Phase. Spend half a year to consolidate your cultivation before making a breakthrough. I will wait for you here.”

“Wait for me?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s time for me to teach you the Great Profound Sword Canon. When you reach the Indigo Origin Phase and grasp saint dao, I’ll teach it to you. This is also an instruction from our master.” Ye Guhan didn’t have any fluctuation on his emotions, but Lin Yun could sense that he was a little anxious.

“Senior Brother, did something happen to our master?” Lin Yun squinted.

“Our master is fine. You can go onto the Dao Comprehending Stage now. This is a rare opportunity for you, and you might even be able to make a breakthrough in your sword intent,” Ye Guhan smiled, looking at the Dao Comprehending Stage.

Lin Yun suppressed his doubts and flew to the Dao Comprehending Stage. He adjusted his mentality well before circulating the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. The thirty-six pagodas around him were like lit candles with a gentle radiance released from them.

When Lin Yun looked around, he noticed that the Dao Comprehending Stage was pitch-black, feeling as though he was in space. In the depths, a celestial palace could be faintly seen, and there were indescribably beauties playing music.

“This feels really magical.” Lin Yun was shocked because it felt like he was in a dream and had left the thirty-six layers of heaven. Suppressing the doubts in his heart, Lin Yun circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. “Let’s consolidate my cultivation first.”

But the moment he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, he heard laughter beside his ears that made him open his eyes.
