Chapter 1049 - Bloodbath the Golden Ranking

Lin Yun was at the last blockade, so he didn’t hesitate to charge at all the geniuses who were present. He had no more patience for anyone that stood in his way.

When he soared into the sky, Iris Flowers bloomed with each step he took. On top of that, he emitted a divine radiance from the Azure Firmament Tree that was behind him. Lin Yun was pushing his sword sutras to the limit.

The blooming Iris Flowers looked eternal, which shocked everyone. They had never seen something so powerful related to the sword. In the blink of an eye, the Azure Firmament Tree grew violently with the addition of his sword intent. Instantly, more flowers bloomed on the tree.

“Not good!” The six gold ranking geniuses felt a torrential killing aura pour towards them. Facing Lin Yun’s attack, they didn’t hesitate to retreat.

The sword dao was known as the strongest dao in terms of offense, and not many people could rival a swordsman in the same cultivation. Although the geniuses managed to retreat in time, the war generals weren’t as lucky. In fact, a general was struck when Lin Yun raised his hand.

Several sword rays tore apart the general, causing blood to splatter everywhere. Shockingly, Lin Yun’s strength had surpassed everyone’s imagination. Who else but a Realm Son could kill a general with a wave of the hand as if it was nothing.

In the next second, heaven and earth trembled as countless phenomena appeared in the sky. The gold ranking geniuses were unleashing their counterattack. Ouyang Yu was the first to attack as he wielded the halberd on his back. As his halberd tore through the air, it had turned into an ice dragon that sent a chill through the surroundings.

At the same time, Zhao Shiqi on the gold ranking attacked. Raising a sun over his head, he made all the spectators throw up blood.

Simultaneously, a bright moon rose behind Lin Yun that emitted a floral fragrance. With a wave of his hand, Lin Yun tore the ice dragon apart with his luminous moon.

“Absolute Dominance!” Lin Yun didn’t let up as he threw another punch. This time around, a sun with golden radiance attacked the gold ranking geniuses. When Lin Yun’s sun clashed with the other sun, wind blew everywhere.

Then, Lin Yun’s punch hit Zhao Shiqi square in the chest. Immediately, a huge shockwave was sent into the surroundings that sent the other geniuses flying.

Slowly but surely, everyone became intimidated by Lin Yun’s strength. His might was terrifying as he alternated between the sky sword intent, the Divine Glorysun Fist, and Divine Glorymoon Fist.

Under this attack, Zhao Shiqi was heavily injured. Lin Yun didn’t hold back as he fused his holy spirit martial technique with his sky sword intent. He didn’t want to waste too much time, so he domineeringly swept through everyone as fast as he could.

The Realm Sons want me to crawl into the plaza? Fat chance! Anyone who dares to stand in my way will die!

The attackers were on the verge of collapse because Lin Yun’s strength made them feel despair. Yang Shuo was finally making a move. He was the strongest among the six geniuses, and he was the first person to appear before Lin Yun. “You lowly ant, this is no place for you to act arrogantly!”

After manifesting a flaming claw, Yang Shuo stabbed towards Lin Yun’s head. He was using an extremely powerful secret technique that pushed the limits of his fortune martial technique. One could even see traces of a holy spirit martial technique in Yang Shuo’s attack.

Lin Yun’s eyes began to flicker because the secret technique was strong. If he didn’t have the Divine Solar Lunar Fist, he might have a difficult time against the claw. Clearly, the gold ranking was filled with extraordinary people. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Raising his hand, Lin Yun brought out the Divine Sun Breaking Seal and manifested a genuine Golden Crow. Unlike Yang Shuo, Lin Yun brought out a genuine holy spirit. Enveloped in light, Lin Yun looked like a deity with Iris Flowers soaring behind him.

Yang Shuo’s face changed when Lin Yun wasn’t affected by his attack. Surprisingly, Lin Yun was able to fend off his attack and charge forward.

Lin Yun’s attack made Yang Shuo’s face change as the latter quickly retreated. The other gold ranking geniuses took advantage of this moment and surrounded Lin Yun. However, all sorts of phenomena began to appear as Lin Yun transformed between a Golden Crow and a Silver Phoenix. With ease, he shuttled between everyone on the gold ranking.

“This fellow is too difficult to deal with!” The gold ranking geniuses were turning pale as Lin Yun exhausted them.

Yang Shuo, who was forced to retreat, attacked once more with an ancient phoenix that flew out of a sea of flames. It already had an outline of a holy spirit, which showed how extraordinary he was. He might not be as strong as the Realm Sons, but he was a powerful expert.

Facing the other geniuses, Lin Yun was caught by surprise and sent flying. His blunder made the gold ranking geniuses happy as their eyes lit up with killing intent.

“He’s not invincible!”

“Everyone, attack together. We can suppress him! He can’t face all of us together!”

“That’s right! He couldn’t handle Yang Shuo’s attacks!”

“Is he finally going to lose?” The generals and other geniuses rejoiced as killing intent resurfaced in their pupils. They mustered up their courage, which was easy since the golden ranking geniuses were holding Lin Yun back.

Everyone began to unleash their attacks without any reservation. When Yang Shuo saw this, his eyes flickered with doubt. He could clearly sense that Lin Yun had the means to transcend fortune, but for some reason Lin Yun was holding back.

But as long as they could inflict injuries to Lin Yun, it wouldn’t matter that he was holding back. When the other gold ranking geniuses began to attack, they unleashed power that was equivalent to Lin Yun back in the Yellow Sandy Plain.

“Wow, they actually have some trump cards,” muttered Lin Yun before throwing out a punch. As the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix bloomed on his fist, he faced everyone’s attacks. However, Lin Yun still wasn’t using the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. From the head-on collision, Lin Yun was sent flying. Meanwhile, his opponents faces were pale as beads of sweat fell from their forehead.

Despite the sweating, everyone smiled when Lin Yun went flying. This meant that Lin Yun wasn’t genuinely invincible. Sooner or later, they could wear him out. Xu Zilin spoke coldly to Lin Yun, “Looks like you aren’t as impressive as rumored.”

“You think you can compete with the Realm Sons with only this much strength? How naive.”

“Lin Yun, get down on your knees and beg!” Ouyang Yu roared at Lin Yun with anger.

Lin Yun merely landed on a roof and glanced at the crowd, “You guys have no idea that you have one foot in the grave.”

Suddenly, Yang Shuo sensed a dangerous aura. Raising his head, he discovered that the Azure Firmament Tree behind Lin Yun had grown to a towering height. At this moment, the Iris Flowers blooming on the tree were twinkling like stars.

The shocking phenomenon sent shivers down everyone’s spine. They were shocked to discover that their movements had been restricted. At this moment, everyone had fear on their face.

“N-n-no!” Everyone began to beg for their life.

Lin Yun felt no pity as he swiped his fingers across the air. Instantly, blood splashed everywhere as everyone was cut in half.

Lin Yun had unleashed the second form of the Three Heavenly Divides. Fused with the holy spirit martial technique, he created an outcome that was unexpected. All he had to do was wait for the Iris Flowers to bloom. Just like that, everyone was dead.

Then, Lin Yun walked into the plaza where the Realm Sons were waiting.
