Chapter 1166 - Sky Shattering (2)

The two beams of star glories contained terrifying power when they shined down. Feng Zhang merely smiled before he threw his punch out, instantly shattering the two star glories into fragments.

When the fragments landed on the shore, they were instantly snatched by the inner and outer disciples. Meanwhile, there were two spheres of light before Feng Zhang. One of them was shining with a metallic luster and the other with a gentle green light.

Looking at the two spheres of light, Feng Zhang opened his mouth and sucked the two spheres of light into his body. In the next second, his cultivation had reached the pinnacle Galaxy Stage in just a blink of an eye. With the benefit of devouring the two star glories into his mouth, his sword intent and martial intent grew.

“Wow!”

“Way to go! Senior Brother Feng!” The inner disciples who managed to obtain the fragments clapped their hands as they cheered and exclaimed in admiration.

As for the core disciples who failed, they were looking at Feng Zhang enviously because they knew that Feng Zhang would become a lot stronger if he succeeded. At that time, the difference between them and Feng Zhang would be akin to the sky and earth.

Feng Zhang wasn’t the only one who succeeded. Liu Qingyan also succeeded and also attracted two star glories like Feng Zhang. After the two of them congratulated each other, they turned to look at Lin Yun with their brows locked, and their faces ugly.

“What’s wrong with Senior Brother Lin?” Wang Yuruo asked just when the two of them fell silent.

Her performance was a tad stronger than Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan. Three star glories had descended for her and she had devoured them. When she was done, she immediately grouped up with those who were also done.

“It doesn’t seem to be going well. Lin Yun seems to have encountered some troubles,” said Liu Qingyan with his brows locked. He had a feeling that Lin Yun’s cultivation wasn’t enough, which was why he couldn’t devour and refine the astral spirits.

After all, there was a huge difference between the Heavenly Soul Realm and Empyrean Realm.

“What should we do?” Wang Yuruo became nervous when she heard that.

It didn’t take long for Ye Ziling to finish as well. She had attracted seven star glories, and she was just one step away from lighting up the constellation. If she had succeeded, there would be a great boost to her strength.

But she was stopped when she was one step away. Then again, Ye Ziling wasn’t too bothered about it. She had the bloodline of the Radiant Snow Saint Clan, and the benefits of the Spirit Astral Mountain weren’t too important to her.

“What’s wrong with Lin Yun?” Ye Ziling asked.

Hearing that, Liu Qingyan and Feng Zhang both smiled bitterly because Wang Yuruo and Ye Ziling asked the same question.

“Things don’t seem good. Senior Sister, look!” Feng Zhang pointed in Lin Yun’s direction. Lin Yun was still seated down without any fluctuation, and no one could see any trace of starlight coming from his body.

“Mhm?” Ye Ziling was surprised when she saw this scene. She had a feeling that something wasn’t right, but she had no idea where the issue was. As more and more people woke up from devouring and refining the astral spirits, they were puzzled when they looked at Lin Yun.

“What’s going on?”

“Is it because Lin Yun’s cultivation is too low to refine the astral spirits?”

“That might be the reason…”

“Then it would be too much of a pity…”

The discussions gradually sounded out from the surroundings. After all, Lin Yun was the center of attention before the Spirit Astral Mountain opened. Furthermore, many disciples and elders had placed great hopes in him.

So they couldn’t help feeling shocked and disappointed to see that Lin Yun couldn’t even be compared to the ordinary core disciples.

Just when various discussions sounded out, a terrifying light shined out in the sky with a gigantic beam of light descending from the sky. It looked like a gigantic mountain was falling down. When the beam of light shined down, everyone discovered that it wasn’t a mountain.

It was a dragon claw condensed with starlight. The claw of the azure dragon was the light of the star group.

When everyone directed their attention towards where the gigantic beam of light was falling, they saw Jiang Lichen suddenly standing up. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When he was enveloped by the light of the star group, the massive aura he gave off had instantly overshadowed everyone else. Even the sky was dark until Jiang Lichen destroyed the claw. Only then did the starry sky return back to normal.

Furthermore, all the inner disciples had benefited greatly when the fragments flew out.

“Senior Brother!” All the disciples in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect went crazy when they saw this scene.

Furthermore, Jiang Lichen’s cultivation had also reached the pinnacle of the Astral Stage under everyone’s gazes. This was the moment that he had been waiting for.

When he swept his glance out, he saw Ye Ziling and revealed a smile on his lips. As he flew over to Ye Ziling, he smiled, “Looks like I didn’t disappoint the sect or master by requesting the Spirit Astral Mountain be opened. I believe I should be able to help out in the ranking battle now.”

“You’re being too humble, Senior Brother. You’ve condensed the light of the star group, which is impressive even in the powerful sects of the Ancient Barren Domain,” smiled Ye Ziling as she gave an objective opinion.

But Jiang Lichen was somewhat disappointed hearing what Ye Ziling said. He could sense that although Ye Ziling was smiling, she was also maintaining a distance between them.

“It doesn’t look good for Junior Brother Lin,” smiled Jiang Lichen as he changed the topic.

Lin Yun was the only one who remained seated on the lake while everyone was already done. As for Luo Hua, she didn’t absorb any astral spirit right from the beginning. Her attention was on Lin Yun throughout the entire process just like the sect master.

“What do you mean?” Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan spoke out unhappily.

They naturally knew that Lin Yun’s situation didn’t look good, but they didn’t think that Jiang Lichen had any right to talk about Lin Yun. The light of the star group was impressive, but who was Jiang Lichen to show off before Ye Ziling on purpose? Not only did he show off before Ye Ziling, but he even tried to trample on Lin Yun.

“Nothing much… his cultivation is clearly insufficient for him to refine the astral spirits. So if he continues to force it, his physique might not be able to take it and he might lose his life,” replied Jiang Lichen.

Seeing that Jiang Lichen cursed Lin Yun, the eyes of Liu Qingyan and Feng Zhang both blazed with flames. Then again, they knew that Jiang Lichen’s words made sense. After all, if Lin Yun could refine astral spirits, he would’ve shined brightly with starlight a long time ago.

“Sorry about that. I’m just speaking the truth.” When Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan looked at Jiang Lichen, they could both sense the mockery in his eyes as if Lin Yun was a piece of garbage.

But all of a sudden, the calm lake started to crack. The sound was too terrifying, and many people fell to the ground from the might of the sound.

“Sky shattering…” All the law-enforcement elders raised their heads as they saw a crack in the fifth layer of the sky.

Starlight shined out of Lin Yun that signified that he had achieved resonance with the Spirit Astral Mountain. When he opened his eyes, the sword aura contained in the Spirit Astral Mountain shattered the fifth layer of the sky.

“There’s always a sky beyond,” muttered Lin Yun.

With a cracking sound echoing out on the lake once more, everyone was shocked to see cracks on the sixth layer of the sky too.

“How is this possible?!” Jiang Lichen’s mouth was wide open when he saw this scene. He couldn’t imagine how many astral spirits Lin Yun absorbed for his resonance with the Spirit Astral Mountain to reach such a high level.
