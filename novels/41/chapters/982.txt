Chapter 983 - This Stage Is Taken

Under the gaze of the azure dragon, no one dared to budge. Even Luo Chen and the other seven heads locked their brows together because the palace was different from what they had imagined. Since this was the Azure Dragon Palace, there should be palaces awaiting them or an ancient altar.

However, the azure dragon was a terrifying next step. The azure dragon’s eyes were indifferent as if it was entirely different from a living creature. Rather, it looked more like an ominous ancient artifact. It almost seemed like there was no secret that it couldn’t uncover.

Suddenly, the azure dragon’s pupils began to blaze as lightning flames spread out on the surface of its body. In a split second, a genius in the pinnacle third soul Heavenly Soul Realm was incinerated. After that person died, wisps of demonic aura flew out of his corpse. It struggled to break free, but it was ultimately extinguished.

“What’s that?”

“Why does it look like those demonic fiends in the ruins…” Many people couldn’t help but look at this scene in confusion.

“There are still demonic fiends here?” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he fell into deep thoughts. Even Yu Haotian had a trace of panic in his eyes because the demonic spirit within his body had become quiet. In an instant, he realized something and tried to circulate the Divine Glorymoon Spirit’s sutra to envelop the demonic spirit.

After everything calmed down, the azure dragon in the sky looked around once more and then disappeared. But before anyone could let out a sigh of relief, a resounding dragon roar echoed out. It resonated throughout the plaza and caused the runes on the plaza to wiggle. When the runes wiggled, they formed numerous stages as a downpour of rain came out of nowhere. When the crowd took a careful look, they realized that it wasn’t water that was falling down, but ominous metal fragments that contained violent energy.

“Dragon scales!”

“Scales of the azure dragon!” Everyone was shocked to see dragon scales raining down and merging with the stages. Because of the scales, the stages were becoming more refined and realistic as a majestic aura permeated the air.

“Dragon scale stages? It looks like there are some stages that haven’t even merged with the dragon scales…” Feng Xuanyi looked at the hundreds of stages with doubt in his eyes. Even Mu Xiuhan and the others were surprised by this scene.

Lin Yun also noticed something different about the stages. There were also some stages that looked illusory, as if they had yet to form a complete stage. But there were more golden runes in those stages, which made them look more refined and majestic. Anyone could tell that they were extraordinary with just a glance. Just when everyone was filled with suspicion, four bolts of lightning streaked across the horizon and fell onto a stage.

“Dragon claw! The claw of the azure dragon!” Lin Yun instantly recognized the true appearance of the lightning bolts. If he was right, after the four claws merged with the stages, the horns, eyes, tail, and heart of the azure dragon would also fall down and merge with some of the stages. In total, the scales, claws, tail, horns, eyes, and heart of an azure dragon had to merge with the stages.

“I see…” Lin Yun had a moment of insight as he realized that these were the inheritances of the Azure Dragon Palace. However, not all inheritances were the same. There were hundreds of stages merged with the scales and only four stages merged with the claws. However, only one stage also had the horns, eyes, tail, and heart.

Clearly, the inheritance of four stages contained the best inheritances in the Azure Dragon Palace. If there were opportunities surpassing fortune in the Azure Dragon Palace, they could only belong to the four stages.

Everyone became excited and tried to head up to the stages. But regardless of how strong they were, they were sent flying when they tried to get on the stage. Some people even executed their fortune martial techniques to force themselves onto the stage, but their only outcome were cuts and bruises.

Then, an ancient aura spread out on the plaza that made the eager cultivators spit up blood. Some of them even fainted from the impact of the aura. It was a scene that made everyone calm down.

“Looks like the Azure Dragon Palace’s inheritances are on those stages,” muttered Lin Yun. He was pondering what the horns, heart, tail, and eyes represented before making a decision. There was naturally no need to consider the scales because they probably only represent greater or advanced fortune martial techniques. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

But even so, they were still attractive to many people. After all, advanced fortune martial techniques were rare in the Heavenly Path. As for the dragon claws, they were only on four stages and possibly contained monarch fortune martial technique. But there was one thing everyone could be sure about, it wouldn’t be a cultivation technique or a top-tier martial technique. At best, it would only be comparable to his Divine Glorysun Fist.

But the heart, tail, horns, and eyes were extraordinary because even the worst probably contained a monarch fortune martial technique. If he thought about it carefully, the horns should fit him the best because the horns were the weapons of the azure dragon. As a swordsman, he might be able to obtain a sword technique. As for the eyes, they probably represented a secret technique like his Flicking Divine Finger.

As for the tail, it probably represented a movement technique. Lastly, the heart might represent a cultivation technique or body-refining technique. Lin Yun realized that he had fallen into a dilemma because all three, excluding the tail, were attractive options.

While Lin Yun was examining the stages, the other geniuses were doing the same. No one would dare to be so stupid when it came picking a stage.

“Either the heart or horns.” Lin Yun made his decision. The horns were naturally the best because he needed a sword technique desperately. However, the heart was also a good choice. After all, a cultivation technique was definitely a lot better. The only thing that Lin Yun was certain about was that the competition would be intense.

“The Azure Dragon Palace only appears once a millennium and the fortune will go to those who are fated with it.” An ancient voice echoed out in the plaza as the stages began to emit a purple radiance. Then, the stages soared into the sky. Since everyone was cautious, no one dared to go up.

“Success!” Everyone was happy that they could finally climb the stages. In the next moment, the stages were filled with at least ten people competing for one stage.

As for Luo Chen, Mu Xiuhan, Feng Xuanyi and the other seven heads, they were all looking at each other. They would naturally fight for the rare stages, which meant that they would have a fierce competition.

“Let’s go!” Luo Chen moved first and charged towards the stage representing the horns. When he moved, Mu Xiuhan also charged towards the same stage. When they both arrived on the same stage, they began to fight.

A brief moment later, Luo Chen had the advantage. With a smile, he said, “You lost.”

At the same time, Pei Xue descended on the stage representing the eyes. This made the faces of Feng Xuanyi and the rest change. They didn’t dare to make a move. As for Yu Haotian, he quietly landed on the tail stage. The tail might be unique, but it was only the tail and wasn’t as dazzling as the three other stages.

This meant that only the heart stage was left. Although Mu Xiuhan lost to Luo Chen, he wasn’t too bothered by the loss. Instead, he decisively headed for the heart stage. Since Luo Chen had obtained the horns stage, he was determined to obtain the heart stage.

But just as he was about to land on the stage, the stage began to tremble violently as a boundless aura swept out. The aura even drew Luo Chen’s attention, causing him to squint as cold light flashed in his eyes.

A young man stood on the heart stage as his clothes fluttered in the wind. Looking at Mu Xiuhan, Lin Yun said, “This stage is taken.”
