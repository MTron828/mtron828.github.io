Chapter 493 - Indigocloud Lake

In the depths of the Bloodbone Mountain Range, there was a lake covered in a purple mist that made it look dreamy. The lake was called the Indigocloud Lake. Just as many beautiful things in the world were poisonous, coincidentally, so was this lake.

The lake water was formed by lightning flame, a mixture of lightning and flame. Even a Profound Martial Realm cultivator would die if they were dropped in it. It was perilous even for Violet Palace Realm cultivators to fall into.

Even staying on the surface was dangerous, so one had to be cautious. After all, no one could ignore lightning and flame. At the center of the lake, there was a beautiful indigo lotus quietly floating on the surface. This was the Indigoflame Goldlotus that many people dreamt of.

But it didn’t seem to have matured yet. Outside the lake, there was also a towering mountain that shot into the clouds. Occasionally, horrifying lightning would flash into the sky.

Anyone who wanted to get to the Indigocloud Lake had to go through the mountain. On the way to the Indigocloud Lake, countless people gathered. All of them looked at the lake with excitement in their eyes.

But this was considered the depths of the Bloodbone Mountain Range, so there were many dangerous beasts around. It wasn’t easy passing through their territory to get to the Indigocloud Lake.

Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts were highly intelligent, and they naturally knew about the Indigoflame Goldlotus’ worth. They might even interfere and launch a war against the humans. So it was still unknown who would be the last one standing. But the human cultivators weren’t too bothered with the beasts.

They were elites from the various forces. At the very least, they were elites from quasi-overlord forces. So they were naturally confident in themselves. If they were afraid, then they wouldn’t be here.

Battle was always part of cultivation. Battle with the heaven, battle with the earth, and battle with other humans.

More and more people gathered in the mountain forest. There was a group of people wearing uniform clothing that entered the depth of the Bloodbone Mountain Range. They were like a pebble that was dropped in a lake, creating a ripple and attracting many people’s attention.

“It’s the Heavenly Province Academy! So many of them came!”

“That’s Liu Yunyan! She’s a beauty from the academy. I heard that many quasi-overlord forces’ elites took a liking to her.”

“She might be pretty, but it’s a pity that her beauty doesn’t work here. No one will offer her the Indigoflame Goldlotus just because she’s pretty. I’m afraid she’ll fall in this competition.”

“That’s right. Strength is the ultimate way of the world and only the capable ones are qualified to possess treasures.”

“But it’s really a pity for a beauty like her to die. Who knows, we might be able to play the hero by saving the beauty. We might even catch her attention.”

“Haha, who knows. Who knows if someone is really capable of taking both the treasure and the beauty.”

Honestly speaking, Liu Yunyan was a beauty. She wasn’t like Lu Siyin who only had a voluptuous figure. She had an elegant temperament that was lethal to many men, which attracted the desire of men to subdue her. So her appearance instantly caught many people’s attention.

The surrounding discussion naturally didn’t escape Liu Yunyan, but she remained calm as if nothing had happened. On the other hand, the disciples around her were all unhappy. After all, those discussions were too much, especially the fantasies of Liu Yunyan.

“Senior sister, do we need to teach them a lesson? They’ll behave themselves after a beating.”

“If we don’t do something about it, they might think that we’re pushovers,” said some disciples. Their words made some sense because intimidation would definitely make those people behave.

“It doesn’t matter. I’m not against having a hero saving a beauty, but only on the prerequisite that they have the strength to do so,” replied Liu Yunyan. Although some of the disciples were reluctant to leave the matter at this, they still didn’t say anything about it.

“Lin Yun is still not here?” asked Liu Yunyan. Lin Yun had been appearing randomly in the recent days and he didn’t travel with them. It had been an entire night and morning since they last saw Lin Yun. Liu Yunyan wouldn’t ask about Lin Yun normally, but she couldn’t help feeling unhappy since they were already so close to the Indigocloud Lake.

“Not yet. I don’t know where he is right now. But I’m sure Big Brother Lin will catch up,” smiled Bai Yi. This was the truth because Lin Yun would always keep up with them.

“Junior sister, you’re really taking his side. Who knows if he might fool us and run away.”

“That’s right. Just look at how ruthless and ferocious he is. He’s definitely not a good person. Who knows if he colluded with other forces behind our backs.”

Aside from Bai Yi and Liu Yunyan, the other disciples were filled with negative opinions for Lin Yun. After all, no one could be like Bai Yi, accepting that a crippled sword slave suddenly became more capable than them. Furthermore, everyone could tell Bai Yi’s feelings for Lin Yun, so they couldn’t help feeling even more triggered.

“Shut it,” said Liu Yunyan as she glared at the disciples who spoke. She might be unhappy, but she wouldn’t believe that Lin Yun would stab her in the back. After all, how could someone who slaughtered his way out of Hell Mode go against his word?

Right at this moment, two figures shot out from the forest as they landed in front of the Heavenly Province Academy’s group. One of them wore a fake smile and was easily recognizable. He was Pan Yue of the Bloodwing Pavilion. He had a rather high position among the Bloodwing Pavilion’s younger generation.

The other was naturally Leng Yi, who was wearing a crimson raccoon mask. Compared to Pan Yue, he was more fearsome as he was covered in a dense mist filled with mystery.

When the two landed on the ground, more people shot out from the forest. They were disciples of the Bloodwing Pavilion.

“Pan Yue and Leng Yi! This is getting interesting now. The Bloodwing Pavilion seems to be here for the Heavenly Province Academy.”

“The two forces don’t exactly have a good relationship in the prefecture, to begin with.”

“We just talked about Liu Yunyan and trouble instantly appeared. It’ll be a huge joke if she was defeated before she could even see the Indigoflame Goldlotus.”

“That’s a high possibility. Pan Yue and Leng Yi are not someone Liu Yunyan can take on alone.”

“Hey, now’s the opportunity to save the beauty.”

The two parties looked at each other as the atmosphere became even more intense. The elites from various quasi-overlord forces were in the crowd and sneering at this scene. The fight for the Indigoflame Goldlotus hadn’t even started, yet the two forces were already at each other’s throat. But they were more than happy to see this scene, at least the number of competitors would decrease.

“Miss Liu, I have been waiting for a long time. You’re rather slow,” said Pan Yue in an eerie voice. He was smiling, but everyone could tell that he wasn’t exactly happy.

“You had better get lost. After all, you wouldn’t want anyone else taking advantage of us fighting,” said Liu Yunyan as the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples became nervous.

“Nah, I'm not here to fight. This brother of mine has something to say,” replied Pan Yue with a smile as he took a step back.

“Have you seen this person?” Leng Yi showed a painting of Lin Yun. He would never forget this person. He made a painting of Lin Yun despite only getting a few glances of Lin Yun. However,his actions made the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples’ faces change.

“Big Brother Lin…” Bai Yi exclaimed as she quickly covered her mouth.

Leng Yi instantly turned to look at Bai Yi before he turned to Liu Yunyan, “So you know him. This person took a thousand third grade spiritual jades from me and I require an explanation.”

“A thousand third grade spiritual jades? Holy shit!”

“Who’s so bold to snatch Leng Yi’s spiritual jades? He’s Nethercloud Ghost’s disciple. Is that person courting death?”

“Hehe, this is getting out of hand.”

Many people exclaimed as it was an enormous sum, even for quasi-overlord forces’ disciples like them. Even Liu Yunyan was briefly surprised because she figured out what was going on. No wonder Lin Yun said that he wasn’t lacking in spiritual jades.

Looking at Pan Yue briefly, Liu Yunyan spoke out coldly, “One thousand third grade spiritual jades to launch a sneak attack at our Heavenly Province Academy. That’s pretty generous.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about. But that brat doesn’t seem to be with you guys. Please tell us his location or else the Bloodwing Pavilion won’t let this matter rest today,” smiled Pan Yue as he folded his arms.

“I don’t know,” replied Liu Yunyan.

“Is that so? Then I’ll get someone who knows how to answer!” Leng Yi’s eyes flashed coldly as he turned to look at Bai Yi.

But just when he was about to make his move, a rumbling roar echoed out, “Hold it!”
