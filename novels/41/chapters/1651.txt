Chapter 1652 - Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella

No one was able to react in time because everything happened too suddenly. But Lin Yun was already alert and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. He was even prepared to summon the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron from the dragon origin ocean, but there was still no time.

When the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder made a move, Lin Yun could feel that his dragon origin was instantly restricted, and his dragon origin ocean had become a dead sea. His connection with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron was also severed, so he was no different from a small child before a Samsara Edict Realm powerhouse.

“Killing you is like slaughtering dogs for me! Come here!” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder sneered. He was confident that no one could save Lin Yun when he was so close to him. Even if they wanted to help, they would be stopped by the others from the Profound Sky Sect, so this was the perfect opportunity for him.

The Profound Sky Sect’s Grand Elder attracted the Sword Sect’s attention on purpose for him to make a move and take Lin Yun back to the Profound Sky Sect. They already planned to first cripple Lin Yun’s cultivation before imprisoning him. Once the Radiant Sword Saint dies, they would then take Lin Yun’s life.

“You guys are too much!” The Sword Sect’s Chen Lei immediately lost it and pushed his right hand forth, wanting to retrieve Lin Yun from them.

“You guys dare to make a move? You guys must be courting death!” The Profound Sky Sect’s Grand Elder sneered before waving his hand, unleashing countless bolts of purple lightning that descended from the sky. As the sky changed, a massive silver moon appeared that looked like a crescent blade that covered half the sky. The Profound Sky Sect’s Grand Elder made a move first by pushing his palm forth, unleashing a devastating attack.

“Indigo Radiant Thunder!” Chen Lei’s clothes fluttered in the wind. His finger was like a spear, thrusting at the palm of the Profound Sky Sect’s Grand Elder. When the palm and spear collided, they emitted a terrifying aura that swept out from Chen Lai and the Profound Sky Sect’s Grand Elder, instantly captivating everyone’s attention.

“Oh my god, a fight broke out just like that?”

“The Profound Sky Sect is too much. What happens in the Ancient Barren Battlefield stays there, and there are no rules. Two decades ago, they caused the death of the Sword Sect’s Golden Generation, so they clearly can’t afford to lose now.”

“They’re too disgusting. They’re just considering the Radiant Sword Saint as old.”

“You guys are too young. The Profound Sky Sect is after Lin Yun. A heaven-defying genius like Lin Yun is the nightmare of the Profound Sky Sect, and they naturally can’t allow him to grow.”

“That’s right. The Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple is doomed. Even if he’s not dead, he’s doomed just like Jian Jingtian from two decades ago.”

“This is an obvious plot from the Profound Sky Sect. Just wait and see. Lin Yun is finished!” The other sect elders all found it unfair to Lin Yun, but there were also those waiting to see Lin Yun die.

A genius? In their eyes, Lin Yun was nothing but a comet that would only shine for a moment. It was impossible for the Sword Sect to depend on him to rise.

Suddenly, a massive sword aura swept out from Lin Yun, creating eighteen cracks in the thirty-six layers of heaven. Through the cracks, starlight shone down on the azure-robed youth who was carrying a sword box on his back. At this moment, he was the heaven, his sword as the dome, and he was one with his sword.

Lin Yun suddenly stopped when he was one meter away from the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder. He was like a sword hovering in the air with sword rays shining from him.

“H-How is this possible?” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder was shocked by what he saw.

“Heavenly Dome Sword Intent!”

“It’s really the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent that even experts in the Samsara Edict Realm have difficulty grasping!”

“That fellow is really a genius in the sword path. This is too terrifying! Then again, only the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent can withstand the palm energy of a profound life stage expert.” All the swordsmen were dumbfounded when they saw this scene.

They were skeptical when they heard that Lin Yun had grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. After all, if he had already grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent while being at the Dragon Pulse Realm, how terrifying would he become after he grows up? There was a possibility that he might surpass the Radiant Sword Saint in the future.

When Lin Yun broke free from the palm energy of the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder, he could finally circulate his dragon origin and put some distance between them.

“Let’s go!”

“Let’s just kill everyone from the Sword Sect!” The faces of the other Profound Sky Sect elders sank. The Profound Sky Sect sent seven Samsara Edict Realm elders and ten-odd Dragon Pulse Realm deacons. Even if they lost all their disciples, they were still stronger than the Sword Sect. They could no longer contain their killing intent when they saw Lin Yun breaking free.

“Everyone from the Sword Sect, listen up! Kill them!” Chen Lei roared and clashed with the Profound Sky Sect’s Grand Elder. It didn’t take long for a war to unfold.

Mu Chuan was worried and shoved a Samsara Edict Realm elder aside before he tried to search for Lin Yun’s location. He then saw Lin Yun pushing his sword intent to the limit and could only dodge left and right. Seeing this, Mu Chuan instantly lost his temper and roared, “Get lost!”

But just when he was about to move, a person wearing a bamboo hood appeared before him. Seeing this person, Mu Chuan’s lip twitched, “Zhuge Qingyun!”

Zhuge Qingyun sneered and tossed the bamboo hat away, revealing his face. But before the bamboo hat could get close to Mu Chuan, it was eroded by an invisible nether energy, turning it into ashes.

“Mu Chuan, your opponent is me.” Zhuge Qingyun said.

Mu Chuan’s face was dark as he coldly said, “I heard that you were really arrogant two years ago, suppressing my Sword Sect’s Sword-Bearing Elder.”

“I don’t really remember that.” Zhuge Qingyun replied. “I only remember a piece of trash named Feng Jue. He seems to be the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. But he’s really a piece of trash, so I nearly took his life.”

Mu Chuan knew that Zhuge Qingyun was trying to enrage him, but he couldn’t bear it. Just like that, they clashed in a flash.

The battle between the two sects was spectacular. It had been a long time since there was such an intense battle. It was like the time when Saints hadn’t appeared in the Ancient Barren Domain. Not to mention that both sides were the old and new overlords of the Ancient Barren Domain.

Although everyone had already speculated that there would be a battle between the Sword Sect and Profound Sky Sect, everyone was still caught by surprise when it really unfolded. They also didn’t expect it to be over a swordsman at the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Lin Yun’s current state wasn’t optimistic, but his blood was boiling in his veins, and his mind was calm. The Sword Sect didn’t have much advantage, and the Sword Sect’s disciples weren’t even qualified to partake in a fight of this level. It was so much so that if Lin Yun wasn’t confident, he would only be a burden by joining in a battle of this scale.

“Senior Brother, catch!” Lin Yun took out the Nether Saint Sword and tossed it to Mu Chuan.

“A Sovereign Saint Artifact?” Mu Chuan could sense the boundless nether energy contained within the sword when he held onto it. But a brief moment later, he started laughing because he could tell that this was a good sword. As boundless nether energy turned into a black dragon, it instantly pushed Zhuge Qingyun away.

“You still dare to be distracted when you’re facing death?” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder waved his hand and pushed it in Lin Yun’s direction.

As the ground cracked, Lin Yun tried his best to avoid it. Simultaneously, his sword box opened, and he held onto the Flower Burial Sword. But the moment he drew the Flower Burial Sword, it was sent flying by the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder.

“Flower Burial!” Lin Yun exclaimed and turned his head over.

“Ha, you must be courting death. Do you want to draw your sword before me? You should just be captured obediently!” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder’s cultivation had reached the pinnacle of the profound life stage, and he was one step away from reaching the profound death stage.

Even if Lin Yun had used his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, he still wasn’t a match for this person, and it wouldn’t take long to be pushed into a dead-end.

“Protect Lin Yun!” Several pinnacle Dragon Pulse Realm deacons tried to rescue Lin Yun, disregarding their life and death. But they were still heavily injured in one clash because of the enormous gap in their cultivations.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Seeing this, Lin Yun took a deep breath and stood with his arms behind him.

The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder also hovered in the sky and stopped ten meters away from Lin Yun.

“Little bastard, what’s wrong? You’re not going to run?” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder snickered.

“I just don’t wish anyone to be injured or die because of me.” Lin Yun said without any emotions on his face.

“Haha. Since you have that realization, you should just surrender yourself. Since you like to dig out the dragon bones of others, I’ll dig out your Divine Dragon Bone today!” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder laughed and appeared before Lin Yun, reaching his hand out at him.

Lin Yun suddenly moved, retrieving an umbrella and putting it between them.

“An umbrella?” The Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder was surprised before he snorted, treating it like an ordinary umbrella. Even if it was a Sovereign Saint Artifact, it was nothing to him because he didn’t believe that Lin Yun could unleash its full power.

His five fingers were like claws aimed at Lin Yun’s chest. But Lin Yun also moved and poured his dragon runes into the umbrella before wielding the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella like a sword and thrust it forth.

When the palm and umbrella brushed past each other, the umbrella's tip was at the chest of the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder, while the latter’s hand was one inch away from Lin Yun’s chest.

Blood dripped down from the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder’s lips as he groaned. The umbrella’s tip failed to pierce his chest, but the immense power still injured him.

Wielding the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, Lin Yun instantly lifted the first seal on the umbrella. When the umbrella shone brightly, the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder was sent flying with disbelief filling within his pupils.

Gently lifting his wrist, Lin Yun opened the umbrella and roared, “Kneel!”

As a sun and a moon flew out from the umbrella, the Profound Sky Sect’s sixth elder was forced down on one knee before he could even react and threw out a mouthful of blood. This scene shocked everyone in the surroundings when they saw Lin Yun.

The radiance of the sun and moon made Lin Yun stand out even more, making him seem flawless in his azure robe.
