Chapter 2193: Chaos Upgraded

Ordinary Demonspirits were already terrifying, possessing horrifying vitality with the ability to create and manipulate demonic corpses. Silver-Eyed Demonspirits were more terrifying because they could revive themselves even if they were dead.

Lin Yun once encountered a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit back at the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Even after it was ‘killed’ for so many years and was less than one percent of its peak strength, it was still terrifying. As for the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit, there was naturally nothing to describe about their terror. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Most sects didn’t have much information about the Demonspirit Clan, but they knew that the Demonspirit Clan were fiends who came from outside the Kunlun Realm. They were responsible for the end of the Golden Era and the turmoil of the Dark Era, slaving all the races within the Kunlun Realm.

“There’s still a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit in this era? It looks like the Kunlun Realm will fall into chaos soon,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said with a complicated gaze as he looked at the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit.

The Demonspirits classified their bloodlines, superiorities, and potentials based on the color of their eyes. This was similar to Saint Physiques in the Kunlun Realm, but they weren’t exactly similar. It was said that all the Golden-Eyed Demonspirits were slaughtered when the Nine Emperors swept through the Kunlun Realm, and those who couldn’t be killed were sealed.

So it was surprising to see a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit in the Kunlun Realm after three thousand years.

“You still have the heart to think about the Kunlun Realm? You should be concerned about yourself, instead,” the Gale Rein Great Saint coldly laughed. He was gravely injured, but didn’t panic because he didn’t have to kill anyone. He just needed to hold the Great Saints back, and their plan would have succeeded halfway.

“I’ll hold him down. You guys head out,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said calmly.

“Haha. All of you should stay behind!” The Golden-Eyed Demonspirit laughed as he pushed his hands forth, unleashing a golden domain that isolated the surroundings.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint was the first to make a move. As someone who became a Saint with his physique, his physique was comparable to a Sovereign Saint Artifact. But when he threw his punch forth, he only left behind ripples in the golden domain, and no cracks could be seen.

“Don’t bother trying. Since I dare to stop you guys, I naturally have the confidence to do so,” the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit said, “If you guys stay here obediently, I won’t take the initiative to move…”

But the moment he said that, the Dragon Origin Great Saint dashed forth, throwing his punch out. His punch was accompanied by a dazzling radiance, and his body looked like an ancient cauldron that could even shatter stars. With a cold face, he dashed forth with a punch that could kill a Saint Sovereign, but this was just an appetizer, “Cut the crap and talk after taking my punch!”

The Golden-Eyed Demonspirit smiled, fearlessly standing on the spot. He didn’t even circulate his saint aura, but the vertical eye on his forehead bloomed with an ancient rune, and he threw his punch out as well.

When the two punches clashed, they produced a huge commotion with cracks appearing in the surrounding space. They both clashed with their physiques, and the Dragon Origin Great Saint was forced to take three steps back before he managed to stabilize himself. He then looked at the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit with deep shock.

“I have long heard that the Dragon Origin Great Saint has a powerful physique, the strongest in the Eastern Desolation. What do you think of mine?” The Golden-Eyed Demonspirit was confident as he wore a smile.

But the Dragon Origin Great Saint said nothing. Their clash earlier was only a test, and he suffered a loss. Suddenly, the chant of an ancient scripture began echoing throughout the hall as sacred radiance burst from the Serene Dust Great Saint. An ancient Buddha appeared behind her. The Serene Dust Great Saint then pushed her palm forth as the Buddha opened its eyes.

The golden palm was enveloped with countless scriptures, feeling as though this palm could crush an entire city. But the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit was calm as he unleashed a black palm with an ancient figure rising behind him.

When the two palms collided, they were both evenly matched with the phenomenon behind them collapsing. With that, the Serene Dust Great Saint and Dragon Origin Great Saint’s faces became ugly. This was because the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit used his physique to clash with the Dragon Origin Great Saint and his cultivation with Serene Dust Great Saint.

But just when the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit was about to speak, a sword ray flew at him that made him drop his smile. This was because the sword was fast, so fast that he couldn’t track it. By the time he came to his senses, it was already impossible to dodge this sword.

Despite trying his best to dodge, the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit was still pierced in his right shoulder.

This sword ray was unleashed by the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint with her fingers, and the fact that it pierced the shoulder of the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit made the Gale Rein Great Saint nervous.

The Golden-Eyed Demonspirit was also shocked before he regained his composure and his injuries swiftly recovered.

“As expected of one the three Sword Saints in the Eastern Desolation, you can even pierce through my physique. My physique is the Scarlet Blood Saint Physique, the inheritance of the Scarlet Blood Emperor.” The Golden-Eyed Great Saint briefly paused, before he said, “But I also have a sword for you!”

He unleashed a golden sword ray with two fingers that cut space into two. This shocked the four Great Saints, and they quickly made a move to block the incoming attack.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint threw out a mouthful of blood, and the Dragon Origin Great Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint took a step back. Only the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint managed to block the sword ray.

“Old fart, it looks like you haven’t recovered from your injuries yet,” the Gale Rein Great Saint smiled eerily.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint’s face was dark, and he didn’t say a word.

The Golden-Eyes Demonspirit said, “Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, what do you think of my sword?”

The situation suddenly became pessimistic because the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit demonstrated strength that was not any weaker than the combined strength of the three Great Saints. As for the Thousand Plume Great Saint, he could only keep an eye on the Gale Rein Great Saint.

The stalemate was destined to last, and the three of them couldn’t provide any support no matter what happens in the outside world.

The battle in the Dao Yang Palace alarmed the entire Heavenly Dao Sect. The elders and disciples of the seventy-two peaks were shocked, but they received orders that they weren’t allowed to interfere. Not to mention that many peaks were under the control of the four major clans. Many people were bewildered. They had no idea what was going on, and they also didn’t dare to leave their peaks.

Right then, the Nether Orchid Courtyard was under attack. The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign led the Saints of the Ye Clan and many Quasi-Saints to launch an attack on the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

The Ye Clan were deeply rooted in the Heavenly Dao Sect, and they sent out all of their clansmen. The commotion that they created was naturally shocking.

This caught the Nether Orchid Courtyard by surprise, but it was fortunate that the Bai Clan’s ancestor was in the Nether Orchid Courtyard, and the array guarding the entire courtyard wasn’t immediately destroyed.

“Ancestor, the Ye Clan has come. It’s just a matter of time before the array is destroyed.” In the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s main hall, there were several Quasi-Saints who nervously came before the Bai Clan’s ancestor. The Bai Clan’s Saints were gathered here, along with many from the Golden Guards. This was the Bai Clan’s greatest trump card. Aside from controlling the Nether Orchid Courtyard, they also controlled a large number of Golden Guards.

Strictly speaking, the Nether Orchid Courtyard belonged to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and the Bai Clan couldn’t interfere much. So their greatest reliance had always been the Golden Guards. The Golden Guards were the intermediate force of the Heavenly Dao Sect. They were an elite enforcement group, and they were saint disciples before they were over a hundred years old. Bai Xiao, who had a close relationship with Lin Yun, was one of them.

“It looks like that old goat is determined to rebel, and he’s not bothering to pretend any more. Is he that certain that the Blood Moon Sect can win?” The Bai Clan’s ancestor was calm without any panic on his face.

“But they want to attack my Bai Clan? It’s not that easy. Let the Golden Guards set up the defenses. We can’t allow them to break the array! As for the other elders, guard the main hall as planned, and don’t interfere unless absolutely necessary. We just have to make sure that the array isn’t broken. Let them go ahead. They want to breach the Nether Orchid Courtyard? What a pipe dream.” The Bai Clan’s ancestor had already calculated this, which was why he didn’t panic and gave out instructions in an orderly manner after the initial shock.

Bai Shuying, who was sitting at the back, frowned, “Ancestor, we also have to dispatch saints to guard the Celestial Pool, aside from the array.”

“The Celestial Pool?” The Bai Clan’s ancestor said indifferently, “If the array is broken, the main hall is naturally more important. The Celestial Pool is just a cultivation ground, so what’s the meaning of guarding it?”

The other Bai Clan’s elders also didn’t agree to it. If the array guarding the courtyard was damaged, there was another array in the main hall. This array was bigger than the outside one, and it was naturally safer to stay here. As for the Celestial Pool, they naturally wouldn’t pay much attention to it.

This was because if the array was broken, a battle would break out, and the Nether Orchid Courtyard would fall into chaos. Once a saint battle took place, saints would be the main force, and each of them could change the outcome. So there was no need for them to split them up. If they couldn’t hold on, they would have to retreat to the main hall.

The main hall wasn’t only protected by a saint array, it was also the path of retreat prepared by the Bai Clan that could allow Saints to leave the Heavenly Dao Sect. But the Bai Clan’s ancestor didn’t say it out loud.

“That’s what the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint instructed me,” Bai Shuying said, gritting her teeth.

The Bai Clan’s ancestor frowned upon hearing the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s name, looking unhappy. If it hadn’t been the protection of the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, Bai Shuying would have long been married to one of the other Ancient Saint Clans, and the scandal with Ye Qingtian wouldn’t have happened.

“Then you get Bai Xiao and lead some Golden Guards to guard it.” The Bai Clan’s ancestor couldn’t be bothered to talk more. He initially planned to take Bai Shuying with him to leave if anything happened, but he could only let her fend for herself now. Anyhow, Bai Shuying had long abolished her identity as a member of the Bai Clan.

Bai Shuying naturally noticed that the Bai Clan’s ancestor disliked her, so she swiftly left the place with Bai Xiao and rushed to the Celestial Pool. She had a hunch that the Ye Clan’s main objective was the Celestial Pool.

“Ancestor, the holy maiden wouldn’t want to guard the Celestial Pool for no reason. Besides, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint has also given her orders. Why don’t I go and guard the Celestial Pool in case something happens?” A Saint Elder said after Bai Shuying left.

The Bai Clan’s ancestor indifferently said, “Seven Feather Saint Lord, the Bai Clan only has thirteen Saints, and two were taken away by the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. Those remaining can barely fend off the Ye Clan, so we can’t split up our forces any more. Who will go after the Celestial Pool? It’s just a cultivation ground, not to mention that it is a forbidden ground. So who could pay attention to it at this moment?”

Hearing that, the Seven Feather Saint Lord could only give up.

The Bai Clan’s ancestor was shrewd, and his purpose was clear, which was to preserve the strength of the Bai Clan. If the Thousand Plume Great Saint was defeated, he would leave the Heavenly Dao Sect with the saints and geniuses of the Bai Clan. At that time, the destruction of the Heavenly Dao Sect would have nothing to do with their Bai Clan.

But if the Thousand Plume Great Saint won or if the Heavenly Dao Sect had other trump cards, the Bai Clan would be able to benefit after the battle. The Bai Clan was an Ancient Saint Clan, and they naturally wouldn’t put all their stakes on the Heavenly Dao Sect. As an Ancient Saint Clan, they had their own foundation and strength.

“As for that lass’ life and death, let her be. I have already done enough to let the Golden Guards go with her,” the Bai Clan’s ancestor said indifferently.
