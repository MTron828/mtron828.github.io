Chapter 1911 - Bullshit

Looking at the sincerity on Ye Qingtian’s face, Bai Shuying’s face eased a little. But she didn’t get any closer to Ye Qingtian and maintained a distance of three feet. She said, “You don’t have to explain to me. I don’t care if you’ve changed or not. Since you have awakened your talent as a swordsman, cherish it well. I know what kind of person Wang Muyan is. No one has managed to get any benefits from her, and many of those she got close to became her plaything, and most of their talent became crippled.”

Lin Yun was stunned while sending a surprised look at Bai Shuying. But he wasn’t too surprised because this was Bai Shuying’s personality. In a nutshell, Bai Shuying was blatant about her emotions. She hated the previous Ye Qingtian but let it go because she promised her master. This breadth of mind was something that Lin Yun didn’t possess.

Pretending to be sad, Lin Yun asked, “Is that all?”

“What else?” Bai Shuying raised her brow. “Don’t tell me that you think I’ll look at you differently just because of your tricks and words?”

“Senior Sister is right,” Lin Yun smiled awkwardly.

“I have no idea what you’ve experienced for the past year. Although you’re still as cocky as before, you’re not that loathsome anymore,” Bai Shuying replied. “Since the Dragon Origin Great Saint has taken you in as his disciple, you better cherish this opportunity well. Don’t interact with the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden too often.”

After she was done, she left like a gentle wind that made Lin Yun feel guilty. He realized that Bai Shuying was pretty adorable if she wasn’t angry.

Tucking his arms together, he muttered, “I wonder if Wang Muyan asked Ye Qingtian to sneak into the Nether Orchid Courtyard for Bai Shuying’s secret or the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s secret…”

“Did the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden take the initiative to talk to you?” A person appeared out of nowhere and asked.

This startled Lin Yun, and he had no idea when Chen Zhong appeared beside him. He didn’t know if his alertness was too poor, if Chen Zhong had no ill intentions, or if Chen Zhong was too strong. He suddenly appeared out of nowhere and asked a question.

Before Lin Yun came to his senses, Chen Zhong continued, “Don’t deny it. I witnessed the Nether Orchid Courtyard standing with you earlier.”

“So what? What has it got to do with you?” Lin Yun asked.

This made Chen Zhong, who was determined to wed a holy maiden, collapse.

“Why don’t you have any reaction?”

“What reaction do you want? Have you not spoken to her before? There are so many people in the Nether Orchid Courtyard, and who hasn’t talked with her before?”

“Take the initiative. The key lies in taking the initiative. How did you manage to do it?” Previously, Lin Yun was the one who pestered Chen Zhong. But it had turned around, and he was bugging Lin Yun. In the end, he said in a depressed tone, “I can’t figure out how I lost to you. What do you have aside from your appearance?”

Lin Yun couldn’t hold himself back and smiled, “You want to know why? Let me ask you one question. If you answer me, I’ll answer you as well.”

“Go on,” Chen Zhong said.

“Why do you have nether energy within your body?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

Chen Zhong breathed and smiled, “I was wondering what you wanted to ask. It’s because of the Nether Sword Sutra from the Netherworld Hall. The Netherworld Hall used to be a branch of the Sword Sect, and the Nether Sword Sutra can be considered an altered version of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.”

“Altered?” Lin Yun’s pupils flashed with doubt because it wasn’t incomplete.

“After reaching the peak, the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra can move on to the Great Profound Sword Canon. The Netherworld Hall naturally doesn’t have the Great Profound Sword Canon, so they can only alter it and fuse it with some demonic path’s cultivation techniques to form the Nether Sword Sutra,” Chen Zhong explained. “The Nether Sword Sutra is comprehensive and can be considered the Netherworld Hall's foundation. So the Nether Sword Sutra that I practice possesses nether energy.”

“I see…” Lin Yun naturally heard about the Netherworld Hall, a powerful sect of the demonic path. In the end, it was because the Sword Sect had declined, so the Netherworld Hall separated itself from the Sword Sect.

“It’s your turn now,” Chen Zhong said in an anticipated tone.

“Didn’t you already say it before?”

“What did I say?”

“As long as you have a good appearance. The answer is often simpler than you think,” Lin Yun said, patting Chen Zhong’s shoulder.

Chen Zhong was stumped and wondered if Lin Yun was serious.

On the other hand, Lin Yun shook his head and continued forth. It didn’t take long for him to reach the third trial. A thousand meters away from him were thirty-six wooden houses, each enveloped in sword intent. They were like thirty-six ancient swords at the foot of the mountain.

The tremendous pressure released from the houses was intimidating and made Lin Yun stop. As Lin Yun observed them, he could see two houses dim down. This probably meant Wang Muyan and Bai Shuying had entered those houses.

He realized that the wooden houses weren’t simple. The reason why the houses weren’t simple was because they were too simple. He didn’t even have to release his sword intent and could roughly see the interior. But the more straightforward it looked, the more cautious Lin Yun became. So he wasn’t in a hurry to enter and observed outside. But even half an hour later, Lin Yun still couldn’t observe anything.

“This trial isn’t simple. Ninety percent of the saint disciples stop here. I was the same in the past.” When Chen Zhong’s voice resounded, Lin Yun turned around to see that Chen Zhong had returned to his usual aloof appearance.

“Are you alright?” Lin Yun asked casually.

“I already knew I didn’t have any hopes and gave up after receiving the answer. Furthermore, I’m destined only to have my sword as my company. There’s nothing bad about it, and I’m already used to it,” Chen Zhong sighed.

Lin Yun briefly pondered before he earnestly said, “Actually, you can consider what I said before.”

“What did you say?”

“You can consider men if women don’t work. You don’t have to go for holy maidens. Holy son works as well. Doesn’t the Dao Yang Palace have a holy son?”

“Get lost!” Chen Zhong cursed.

“How did you fail back then?” Lin Yun smiled, changing the topic.

“I don’t know. I went in for an incense of time and came out when it burnt out.”

“No more?”

“No more.”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lin Yun briefly pondered before he asked, “Speaking of which, do you know the highest level anyone has reached?”

“Among the current saint disciples, few made it to the fourth level, not to mention the fifth. Only one or two monsters reached the sixth level,” Chen Zhong shared.

“Looks like it’s harder than I’ve imagined. What about the ninth level?” Lin Yun asked.

“No one has reached it in the past eight hundred years, and no one knows what’s on the ninth level,” Chen Zhong replied.

“It looks like it’s practically impossible for me to reach the ninth level in one go,” Lin Yun said, holding onto his chin.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Chen Zhong looked at him as though he was looking at a monster. He said, “You’re really… confident in yourself. You’re only at the Profound Death Stage. Don’t even mention the summit of the third level. It’s already impressive if you can make it through this trial.”

“This trial? I roughly have an answer already.”

Lin Yun entered a wooden house under Chen Zhong’s shocked gaze. This made Chen Zhong hesitant, and didn’t dare to decide too quickly.

After Lin Yun entered the wooden house, the interior was empty. There was nothing else aside from a mat and an incense burner. Lin Yun wasn’t too concerned, looking at the incense burner and sitting on the mat. This trial had nothing to do with the incense burner, and there wasn’t any time restriction.

This trial tested one’s comprehension and attainment in sword dao. The answer was already on the wooden houses, and it tested how much you can forget.

Lin Yun was confident that his speculation was right on. But knowing was one thing, and if he could accomplish it was another. When the sword intent shone onto his body, it formed fireflies in the surrounding area.

When Lin Yun sat down, it felt like he had become a monk. When the sword intent shone onto him, it felt comfortable to Lin Yun, as though he was basking in the spring.

As time flowed, light shone on Lin Yun’s forehead. The light soon dispersed into the air. Those represented his accumulation over the years, all his comprehension and sword dao that he comprehended since the Xiantian Realm.

Those were his treasures back then, and they gave him tons of help. But now that he looked at it, he noticed something wrong because his sword dao was a heterogeneous accumulation. So he had to forget them and only leave behind the purest comprehension in sword dao.

The difficulty was great because the comprehension in sword dao was deep in his bones and engraved on his soul. He speculated that the main objective wasn’t to forget them all but to reach an acceptable level. Even his master couldn’t forget them all in a short time.

As time gradually flowed, the light emitted by Lin Yun increased, and his Sword Heart became increasingly purer like crystals. His Sword Heart also began to shrink in size before it formed from an invisible existence into a ‘Sword Pellet’ within his body.

The Sword Pellet was silver, and it was the size of a nail located within his heart. Moreover, it even began to beat like a heart.

As the lights within the wooden house kept wriggling and fusing, it ultimately formed into a white-clothed old man. When Lin Yun sensed the old man's presence, he opened his eyes, and his pupils became clear. Although there was no improvement in his sword dao, he could feel that his body had become lighter, and his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent wasn’t that heavy anymore.

It had become a clear lake with his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent like a magma that could boil at any moment. When he saw the old man, he said, “Senior.”

The old man lit an incense and said, “To grasp the Sword Heart at such a young age. This is unbelievable. If I was still alive, I would surely take you in as my disciple and nurture you into a peerless Sword Saint… no, a Sword Emperor!”

But Lin Yun was calm as he replied, “Senior, I want to talk on a Sword God’s path.”

The old man’s face immediately sank, and he snorted, “Bullshit. Young man, I’ll tell you honestly that you have failed this trial.”
