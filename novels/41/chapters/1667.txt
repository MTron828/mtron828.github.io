Chapter 1668 – Curtain Falls

Tian Xuanzi felt extremely awkward, while the spectators were briefly stunned before they broke into an uproar. After all, Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng was a person of legend, the strongest swordsman in the Kunlun Realm. There were rumors that he was the closest person to the Sword God and had ended the Darkest Era with the eight other emperors three thousand years ago.

Everyone in the Kunlun Realm grew up hearing the legends of the Nine Emperors. Of the Nine Emperors, the Southern Emperor might be the strongest, but the Sword Emperor had the highest popularity. Not only was it because of his status as the strongest swordsman, but his lone-wolf characteristic made him a legend in the hearts of many. In the hearts of swordsmen, his existence was comparable to gods. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The Divine Dragon Era was a place where everyone chased after their dreams, and Yu Qingfeng was the dream of all swordsmen. Who wouldn’t want to become a peerless expert like the Sword Emperor?

A brief moment later, Tian Xuanzi dismissed the black sphere in his hand. Since the legend himself had arrived, this meant that everything had come to an end. No one would dare to confront a myth, and Tian Xuanzi could only suck it up, even if he was unhappy about it.

“You’re not stupid. You’re just nasty. Didn’t you say that I should get my ass out earlier?” Yu Qingfeng continued to sit as he looked at Tian Xuanzi with a playful gaze.

Tian Xuanzi’s face immediately changed upon hearing that. Then he lowered his head to explain in a soft voice, “I was rude earlier, but all of that was directed towards those in the Ancient Barren Domain. I never expected that Senior Sword Emperor would descend here.”

“Oh?” Yu Qingfeng smiled. “So you’re saying that I’m not someone of the Ancient Barren Domain? Speaking of which, I was the one who conquered the Ancient Barren Domain back then.”

Tian Xuanzi was alarmed by that and quickly raised his head. When he looked at Yu Qingfeng, he could feel an ill premonition.

“Someone of my status shouldn’t make a move against you, since you’re not worth it for me to make a move. But if I don’t do anything, everyone might think I’m a pushover.” Yu Qingfeng continued.

“I have no intentions of offending you, Senior. Please, spare me.” Tian Xuanzi didn’t dare to refute and could only lower his head.

But Yu Qingfeng didn’t bother with Tian Xuanzi’s words and said, “Too late.”

When he pushed his palm forth, multiple swords formed from mercury flew out of his body, stabbing into Tian Xuanzi’s body.

“No!” Tian Xuanzi’s face became distorted as he let out a miserable shriek. The pain wasn’t only in his body, but also his heart. This was because Yu Qingfeng was severing his saint pulse!

A few breaths later, once those mercury swords were removed, bloody holes appeared on Tian Xuanzi’s body. Tian Xuanzi then fell onto the ground. His aura had dropped and his face was pale.

“I destroyed seven of your saint pulses, destroying your cultivation for the past century. Tian Xuanzi, do you have any complaints about that?” Yu Qingfeng looked at Tian Xuanzi without any emotions on his face.

“This junior is grateful that you spared my life!” Tian Xuanzi gritted his teeth with flames blazing in his pupils. But he could only kneel on one knee and lower his head.

Meanwhile, everyone in the surroundings was shocked. The Profound Sky Sect’s Saints were horrified because a century of Tian Xuanzi’s cultivation had gone down the drain, not to mention that seven of his saint pulses were severed. This severed the possibility of him restoring them, which was too ruthless. But no one dared to utter a word, and some people didn’t even dare to raise their heads to look at Yu Qingfeng.

“Thank you for your help, Senior.” LIn Yun’s voice resounded as he struggled to his feet and cupped his hands together.

Yu Qingfeng looked at Lin Yun with disdain. He finally knew why something that could be resolved with one sword would become so troublesome. Seeing that Lin Yun was still standing there, wrapped up in the Firmament Saint Cloth, Yu Qingfeng naturally understood everything.

“Do you know what the cloth you’re wearing means? Get lost immediately, as far as you can. If you don’t get lost now, even I won’t be able to save you.” Yu Qingfeng urged as he transmitted his voice over.

“But, my master…” Lin Yun turned to look at the Radiant Sword Saint beside Yu Qingfeng and hesitated. This was because he had no idea of his master’s current condition.

“He won’t die here. I will send him back to the Sword Sect, but whether he can make it through the tribulation depends on himself.” Yu Qingfeng wore a helpless expression, but he still explained to Lin Yun by transmitting his voice over.

Hearing that, Lin Yun waved his sword and summoned the Flower Burial Sword back before sending an unwilling look at his master.

“Lin Yun, stop dazing off. This empress will take you away!” Lil’ Purple soared into the sky and yelled. Snow began to fall from the sky as the two divine runes on her forehead intertwined.

“Why is it snowing all of a sudden?” Many people reached out to catch the falling snow with doubt on their faces. When they looked at Lil’ Purple, they were stumped by her beauty, even though she was a little girl. At this moment, Lil’ Purple was giving off an elegant, exquisite, and noble aura.

Before they could catch another look at Lil’ Purple, a phoenix cry echoed, and she turned into an indigo ice phoenix that flew towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun grabbed onto the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute that fell off after Lil’ Purple transformed and landed on her back. Like that, the phoenix swiftly left with Lin Yun without Lin Yun turning his head back.

With that, everything ended with the descent of a legend. The Radiant Sword Saint lived, and the Sword Sect became the ultimate winner of this Ancient Barren Battlefield, taking revenge for what happened two decades ago.

Most of Tian Xuanzi’s saint pulses were severed, and a century of cultivation was erased. Not to mention that a Saint Lord of the Profound Sky Sect died in the hands Lin Yun. But Lin Yun’s heart felt empty for some reason, and he quickly realized he was unwilling to leave.

He was unwilling to leave the sect, his companions, and the seniors who cared for him. He still remembered how he entered the saint pool, how Mu Xuankong made him a heaven-direct disciple despite the objections, and how he was ambushed by Jin Jue, causing Mu Xuankong to slay the Nether Divinity Clan’s patriarch.

He was also unwilling to leave his master. Not only was the Radiant Sword Saint his master, he was also Jian Wuming, the man who founded the Firmament Sword Pavilion. That was a secret that only the two of them knew about. But he was about to leave now? Hide his name and never come back?

A tear rolled down Lin Yun’s cheek, and he wondered if he would hide for the rest of his life and never return. His hand was trembling when he grabbed onto the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute. His master had yet to become an Emperor, and Tian Xuanzi had yet to die. So how could he not come back?!

Turning back, he looked at the Radiant Sword Saint and yelled from the bottom of his heart, “Master, wait for me! I will come back! Wait for me! I want to witness you becoming an Emperor! Tian Xuanzi, just wait! If I don’t die today, I will be back in the future to take your life!”

As Lin Yun’s voice echoed, a tear rolled down the Radiant Sword Saint’s cheek as he clenched his fists together. He made up his mind that he was determined to become an Emperor! He wanted to speak and reply to Lin Yun, but time had stopped in the region that he was in.

When Tian Xuanzi was helped back to his feet, his face was terrifyingly dark as he looked in the direction Lin Yun had left.

Lin Yun will return? That better be the case! Tian Xuanzi’s pupils were filled with endless killing intent.

Four streaks of light descended from the sky, with terrifying auras spreading out. When everyone looked at the four of them, they were all shocked. But they swiftly fell to their knees by the auras those four gave off. They were naturally the Flame, Blade, Black, and White Emperors.

Everyone was shocked by this scene because this meant that five of the nine emperors were here. Was something big going to take place in the Divine Dragon Era? This was too unbelievable because those five were legends.

But the four emperors looked somewhat pathetic, and their faces were ugly as they looked at Yu Qingfeng. They had all suffered at the hands of Yu Qingfeng.

“Yu Qingfeng, you’re really ruthless!” The Blade Emperor quickly landed beside Tian Xuanzi and examined the latter’s injuries. After he examined Tian Xuanzi’s injuries, his eyes were blazing with rage.

“Lin Yun has the Firmament Saint Cloth, and he used it to kill the Nether Divinity Ancestor.” Tian Xuanzi said while clutching his chest.

“Are you serious?” The Blade Emperor’s face changed.

“Everyone here can be witnesses to it…” Tian Xuanzi smiled bitterly.

The Black and White Emperors squinted their eyes when they looked at Yu Qingfeng. The White Emperor took a mouthful of wine before he said, “The white doesn’t drink.”

“The black doesn’t kill.” The Black Emperor smiled when their gazes fell onto Yu Qingfeng.

The Flame Emperor’s gaze turned towards the direction that Lin Yun left in. Although Lin Yun had left long ago, they could still catch up if they gave chase now.

The Blade Emperor, Chen Zilong, coldly said, “Yu Qingfeng, it’s fine if you let that brat leave, but what about the Firmament Saint Cloth? If it falls in the hands of the Demonspirit Clan, can you bear the responsibility for that? Don’t care about him and chase after that brat! No matter what, the Firmament Saint Cloth has to be under the control of the Divine Dragon Empire!”

But Yu Qingfeng didn’t do anything but merely raised his head to smile at the four. This instantly made the four nervous before Yu Qingfeng finally opened his mouth, “A bright moon shines in the sky while the broken bridge is covered with snow and water.”

When he finished, the sky suddenly became dark, and a moon made an appearance. The moon looked realistic, and snow began to fall, before Yu Qingfeng sat on the broken bridge. With a smile, he stood up, “Who can understand my heart that is like a moon? Whoever smiles are those stuck in a painting. Since I’m still around, I’m naturally waiting for you guys. No one can take away someone I’m protecting, not even if the Divine Dragon Empress came herself. As for you four, stay in my painting for some time.”

Together with the Radiant Sword Saint, they strode into the moon. Just before they were about to enter the moon, Yu Qingfeng turned around and smiled before disappearing. The moon and broken bridge also disappeared when he vanished, with only the snow remaining. In the snowflakes, there was a painting that was falling from the sky and fell onto the snow.
