Chapter 959 - Clowns

Xu Que’s face turned completely black as he stared at Lin Yun, “You’re just a piece of trash from the lower realms. Kill him!”

The Demon Slaughtering Realm spread out and unleashed their origin energy at the same time. Together, they stomped their feet and enveloped Lin Yun with attacks.

“Azure Dragon Sword Aura!” With a single thought, Lin Yun’s boundless sword intent manifested into an azure dragon that coiled around him. The elites who were charging Lin Yun froze in mid-air when they heard the dragon roar coming from Lin Yun’s sword intent.

Xu Que wasn’t expecting his minions to fail. “Don’t panic. Attack together and destroy the sword intent around him!”

But the moment he finished speaking, the azure dragon exploded and sent all the elites flying. Then, the dragon flew into Lin Yun’s fist that was landing square on Xu Que’s chest. Xu Que was sent flying as his organs rolled around. When he raised his head again to look at Lin Yun, his pupils were written with deep shock. Although Lin Yun’s attack didn’t break his origin energy, Lin Yun’s sword intent penetrated his defenses.

“Is this all you got?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with mockery. “You’re not even comparable to Liu Mu.”

“I’ll hold him up. The rest of you attack from outside the range of his sword intent!” Xu Que’s sinister face was full of killing intent. Clearly, he never expected that he would suffer such a huge loss to Lin Yun. However, this made him determined to exhaust Lin Yun to death if he needed to.

With a flash, Xu Que appeared before Lin Yun and circulated his aura oceans, pushing his aura to the limit. However, Lin Yun still showed no signs of retreating.

Meanwhile, the Demon Slaughter Realm followed Xu Que’s instruction and attacked from afar. Although the attacks weren’t strong, they built up quickly.

This fellow is really shameless… Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he desperately wanted to bring out his sky sword intent to cut Xu Que down. However, Lin Yun knew that it wasn’t the right time to reveal his trump card.

In just a brief moment, they exchanged over ten moves. At this point, Lin Yun’s sword aura was becoming weaker.

“Tsk, tsk. Let me see how long you can last for!” Xu Que smiled sinisterly. But before he could finish, screams echoed out with the arrival of Lil’ Red. Wielding the Void Blade, Lil’ Red flashed through the air and sent blood flying everywhere.

“Damn it! Why is this despicable cat here?!” Xu Que yelled. The reason why he dared to fight Lin Yun was because Lil’ Red wasn’t present. Xu Que was trying to use that to his advantage by slowly wearing Lin Yun out. Lil’ Red’s appearance ruined that plan, so he contemplated retreat.

“You think you can leave?” Lin Yun’s dim sword intent exploded as it manifested into a terrifying thunderstorm. When his sword intent reached the peak, a dragon roar echoed out from within Lin Yun’s body.

“Azure Dragon Incinerating Palm!” Before Xu Que could react, Lin Yun already pushed his palm forward. A black dragon claw enveloped half of the horizon before landing on the fleeing Xu Que.

Xu Que groaned as his face became pale. Then, a gigantic winged human appeared in front of him as Lin Yun’s hand radiated with light.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

This move again… Fear flashed in Xu Que’s eyes. Fortunately, he was prepared for Lin Yun’s attack. Simultaneously, Xu Que prepared his strongest attack, “Demon Light Dragon Armor!”

When Lin Yun’s attack landed on Xu Que’s armor, a series of explosions echoed out. Then, fine little cracks spread out on Xu Que’s armor.

“Haha. Is this the power of an imperial fortune martial technique? I guess it’s not that impressive!” Xu Que laughed. It was just as he had expected. He didn’t have to worry about Lin Yun’s imperial fortune martial technique with his higher cultivation. It turned out that Liu Mu was injured mostly because he was careless.

“Lin Yun, just you wait. I won’t let you take this corpse so easily.” Xu Que laughed as his eyes flashed coldly. He had already planned to join hands with Liu Mu and Mo Yan after leaving. He knew that they were definitely interested to know where Lin Yun was, so he quickly retreated, “We’ll meet again in the future!”

“How ignorant,” snorted Lin Yun as the winged human spread its wings and shined brightly. With outstretched wings, all of the light in the world was absorbed by the winged human while the surroundings were thrown into darkness.

Simultaneously, a divine aura enveloped the entire region, which caused Xu Que’s smile to freeze. He was horrified to discover that he was slowing down. The realization gripped his heart in fear. After all, he was being restricted by Lin Yun’s phenomenon when he was already in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

Lin Yun’s hair fluttered violently as the winged human hovered in front of Xu Que. With a flash, Lin Yun appeared in front of Xu Que and hit him with a golden palm.

In the next second, Xu Que’s armor shattered into pieces while he spit up mouthfuls of blood. Flying away, Xu Que smashed into all of the large rocks that were blocking his path. When his body finally came to a stop, he looked like he was barely alive.

When he raised his head to look at Lin Yun once more, his eyes were filled with fear. He lost all of his previous arrogance and ran for his life, “Quick, retreat!”

“Clowns.” Lin Yun snorted as anger flashed across his face. Lil’ Red got up to chase after Xu Que, but Lin Yun stopped Lil’ Red. “There’s no need to chase after him.”

Lil’ Red returned to Lin Yun’s shoulder and watched. Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with a small fry like Xu Que. If he wasn’t so secretive about his trump card, he would have no problem killing Xu Que. In the end, it didn’t matter if Xu Que fled because Lin Yun wasn’t going to waste time on a piece of trash.

“Guard the surroundings. Don’t let anyone get close.” Lin Yun squinted his eyes before turning his attention to the corpse. This was his opportunity to make a breakthrough to the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm.
