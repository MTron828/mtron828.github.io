Chapter 1567 - First On The Elysium Core Ranking

Huang Xuanyi knelt on the ground, screaming while covering his eyes. His blood seeped through the seam of his fingers, and his pathetic state made the spectators pity him.

They couldn’t compare the current Huang Xuanyi to the same person who claimed that he would monopolize the baptism and a holy land’s genius. He occupied the Elysium Core Ranking for years and came for the baptism so that he could walk further in the Dragon Pulse Realm, repeating his legend with the Elysium Core Ranking.

This was initially a game for him, but he became a person with a disability when the battle ended. Not only was he kneeling on the ground, but his eyes were also crippled. Let’s not mention repeating his legend on the Dragon Pulse Ranking because it was a question if he could even reach the Dragon Pulse Realm at this point.

The entire Heavenly Pool Manor became quiet, and the ping of a needle could be heard. Even the various sects’ Dragon Pulse Realm disciples could feel a chill run down their spines as they looked at Lin Yun with shock. They couldn’t imagine just how he managed to do it.

They might be able to suppress Lin Yun now, but they also knew that Lin Yun would soar to the sky once he reached the Dragon Pulse Realm. At that time, he would obtain strength comparable to the geniuses of the Golden Generation.

The Profound Sky Sect’s Luo Yuan was dumbfounded and couldn’t comprehend what was happening. Lin Yun only turned around and glanced at Huang Xuanyi. So how did he suddenly become blind? Not only him but the leaders of the other sects were also dumbfounded because this was simply incomprehensible to them.

Only the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord could see the entire process, and he knew what had happened. But that was precisely why he had a more significant doubt than everyone else. A sheer genius in the Elysium Core Realm possessed the aura of a divine dragon? Not to mention that Lin Yun even used an ancient dragon clan’s eye technique.

When Luo Yuan came to his senses, he immediately flew over to examine Huang Xuanyi’s injuries before he became nervous. Huang Xuanyi’s eyes were crippled, and he nearly fainted from the pain. If the holy land behind Huang Xuanyi pursued the responsibility, the Profound Sky Sect would be in trouble.

“Senior Brother!” The two other Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses from the Profound Sky Sect followed after, and their faces were ugly.

“Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, you’re ruthless enough. I’ll remember this!” Huang Xuanyi no longer had the face to stay behind after being publicly humiliated.

“Brother Huang!” Luo Yuan yelled, but Huang Xuanyi didn’t bother about him and swiftly left the Heavenly Pool Manor.

“Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, good!” Luo Yuan gritted his teeth, giving off the feeling of wanting to devour Lin Yun whole. This Heavenly Pool Gathering was utterly ruined for them. Not only did they fail to step on the Sword Sect, but this battle made Lin Yun famous. He knew that from today onwards, Lin Yun would become the strongest on the Elysium Core Ranking.

“Back down.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said, emitting a wisp of his saint aura as he looked at Luo Yuan and Lin Yun.

“Understood!” The two knew the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was afraid they would start a fight here. At that time, this matter would only get out of hand.

Thus, the two returned to the pavilions belonging to their sects. When Mu Xueqin and others saw Lin Yun returning, their pupils were filled with excitement, especially Mu Xueqin. “Are you alright?”

She saw a possibility in Lin Yun to suppress the Ancient Barren Domain and shake the Eastern Desolation. There was a high possibility that Lin Yun might become the second Jian Jingtian and bring the Sword Sect back to being a holy land.

“I’m fine.” Lin Yun replied.

“How did you manage to do that?” Zhao Yan asked. As a sword fanatic, he was stumped by Lin Yun’s sword technique, especially the sword technique that rebounded the Divine Sun Moon Altar.

“That’s the Profound Sword Form. I’ll teach you another time.” Lin Yun smiled because Zhao Yan was still the same person as before; he was still a sword fanatic. While others were worried that he was injured, Zhao Yan was only concerned with Lin Yun’s sword technique. Although Zhao Yan didn’t specify it, Lin Yun knew he was talking about the Profound Sword Form.

“No, no, no. I only want to know how you did it.” Zhao Yan asked.

“What should we do now?” Ye Ziling turned to look at Mu Xueqin. Everyone initially thought the Heavenly Pool Gathering would become a one-man show for Huang Xuanyi before receiving the baptism alone. But Lin Yun had won the battle, and they had no idea how the Heavenly Pool Gathering should continue.

“Let’s see what the Saint Lord decides.” Mu Xueqin replied. The other sects’ disciples also turned to the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord. Huang Xuanyi had already lost, and they were more concerned about their own interests after they came to their senses.

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was calm, and turned to Lin Yun, “Does anyone wish to challenge Lin Yun?”

Everyone was stunned when they heard that. After all, Huang Xuanyi, first on the Elysium Core Ranking, was defeated. So who else would dare to challenge Lin Yun?

“Does any Elysium Core Realm genius wish to challenge Lin Yun?” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord asked again, sweeping his gaze over the Thunder Sect, Heavenly Blade Pavilion, Profound Valley, Heavenly Note Sect, and the Profound Sky Sect. But seeing that no one dared to say anything, the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord turned to look at Lin Yun, “Very well. Lin Yun, do you wish to monopolize the pool for yourself?”

Everyone was briefly stunned before they came to their senses. They now knew why the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord would ask twice. He wanted Lin Yun to inherit Huang Xuanyi’s rights. But they couldn’t find an issue when they thought about it.

“I don’t need to monopolize it. Just have the Sword Sect go first.” Lin Yun swiftly responded. He naturally wasn’t willing to monopolize the baptism because this meant that the other disciples of the Sword Sect wouldn’t be able to obtain any benefits. But if they started with the Sword Sect first, this meant that the Sword Sect would have three quotas.

The Sword Sect’s disciples were briefly shocked before they rejoiced. If the Sword Sect went first, the other sects would have two less quotas.

“Lin Yun, do you know about the benefits of monopolizing the pool?” Mu Xueqin asked.

“There’s no need for that.” Lin Yun confidently replied. His foundation made him confident about condensing dragon origin even without the baptism.

“That’s not the same.” Mu Xueqin knew what Lin Yun was thinking and explained, “According to the legend, the Elysium Core Realm has a limit. Huang Xuanyi stayed in the Elysium Core Realm for so long to reach it Coming to the Ancient Barren Domain was probably his last attempt.”

“What’s the limit of the Elysium Core Realm?” Lin Yun asked

Mu Xueqin looked at Lin Yun with a grave expression. “Ten stars! In ancient times, many powerhouses have reached ten stars. If you can reach ten stars, you’ll be able to condense the legendary tenth pulse in the Dragon Pulse Realm!”

Mu Xueqin’s words shocked everyone because they had never heard of that before. The expressions on the other sects’ disciples also changed when they heard her; only Luo Yuan’s face was calm. He naturally knew about the limit of the Elysium Core Realm, which was why Huang Xuanyi came to the Profound Sky Sect; it wasn’t a sect amongst the holy lands.

“The Elysium Core Realm really does have ten stars.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said just when everyone was feeling uncertain.

“Lin Yun, what do you think now? Do you still insist on your decision?” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord asked again.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Lin Yun’s eyes began to flicker when he heard that. This was the first time he had heard of it, and he knew that this was a rare opportunity for him. So this instantly placed him in a dilemma. But he quickly made his decision.

He was confident about reaching it even if he couldn’t reach it this time, and he didn’t have to rely on the pool. But this could help the other saint disciples to condense dragon origin in the first pulse.

“I stick to my decision.” Lin Yun replied.

“Good!” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord smiled because Lin Yun was starting to pique his interest. He knew that the Radiant Sword Saint had taken in a good disciple. Even if he failed to reach ten stars, this courage alone meant that his future achievements wouldn’t be inferior to the Radiant Sword Saint.

Luo Yuan also smiled when he heard that, but his smile was filled with mockery as he looked at Lin Yun like he was looking at an idiot. He knew that Lin Yun was no longer a threat, and he didn’t think that Lin Yun would be able to find any opportunities aside from this pool.

“Come with me, then!” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord waved his hand. When a golden altar flew out from the clouds, he was the first to go on it.

“Let’s go.” Mu Xueqin looked at Lin Yun before landing on the golden stage with everyone else. This golden stage was a myriad rune saint artifact and a key to the summit of the Heavenly Pool Peak.

The journey was smooth as they passed through the layers of spiritual arrays on the summit. There was a massive platform at the summit of the mountain and a pool at the center. The pool was shrouded in a dragon aura that emitted a suppressive aura, which should be the Dragon Transforming Pool.

The silhouettes of divine dragons could be seen within the mist above the Dragon Transforming Pool, and those dragons looked agile.

“It’s not easy to open the Dragon Transforming Pool, and I’m only tasked with guarding this pool. So you guys can determine your quotas now. Aside from the Sword Sect, the other sects only have two quotas.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord turned back to look at the other disciples before his gaze stopped on Luo Yuan, “Luo Yuan, you have no opinion about that, right?”

The other sects naturally had no objection because they initially didn’t have a share in the pool. But the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord had to be more careful with the Profound Sky Sect because of Tian Xuanzi.

Squinting his eyes with a smile, Luo Yuan replied, “Saint Lord, you’re being too polite. Since I didn’t say anything, I naturally have no objections. We’re only grateful that the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple has such high morals.”

He could accept anything as long as Lin Yun didn’t choose to monopolize the Dragon Transforming Pool.

But Lin Yun furrowed his brows upon hearing that because that tone was really hateful, and Luo Yuan was mocking him.

“Enter the pool, then!” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said, disrupting Lin Yun’s thoughts. As he waved his hand, the mist above the pool dissipated, and a golden pool appeared before everyone.
