Chapter 595 - Fight

The owner of the footsteps must be strong and there was a high possibility that he was a monstrous genius on the Dragoncloud Ranking. But since Lin Yun had found the Profound Yin Water, there was no way he would just give up on it, even if the newcomer was a genius on the ranking.

Lin Yun decided to stay in the dark and observe when the mysterious footsteps sounded out again. But before Lin Yun could focus on his hearing, a silhouette shot into the hall. The figure moved like a breeze as he passed through everyone and arrived before the stone pillar.

Under the light from the ceiling, Lin Yun could see that person’s back. This person was donned in grey and he also had a massive build. The back of his figure was enough to make anyone feel greatly pressured.

“It’s really the Profound Yin Water...but what a pity…” The youth muttered as he looked at the jade bowl.

The intense fight in the hall suddenly settled down as everyone looked at the youth. When they saw the youth’s ordinary clothes without any emblem of a sect, they all revealed a sinister smile on their faces.

“Where the hell did you come from? You think we’re fools?”

“It doesn’t matter who you are. You want to take the Profound Yin Water from us? Impossible!”

“Let’s kill this fellow first!” Everyone began to look at the youth in grey like a dead person.

Facing everyone with his back, the youth in grey revealed a sneer on his lips. Without any signs, he suddenly turned around and threw a punch out. With his origin energy gathering onto his fist, his punch flew out like a bolt of lightning, “Die!”

Eight of the cultivators had already charged forward, so they were caught by surprise at the sudden punch. They didn’t have the time to set up their defenses and were pulverized into bloody mist. However, the power of the punch didn’t weaken as it continued towards the group and sent the rest flying while vomiting up blood.

“An expert on the ranking!”

“Quick, leave! This person is Thunderbolt Palm, Guo Xu, ranked on the seventy-eight!”

“Let’s go!” When the news of the empyrean’s tomb spread out, it lured many experts on the ranking over to the Withernorth Sea. This meant that anyone who ran into them could only blame themselves for being unlucky. If they ran into an expert, they could only run. Otherwise, they’re only outcome was death.

In the blink of an eye, everyone who was still alive had run away. This was also because Guo Xu had no intention of fighting. If he was willing, no one would be able to escape.

The reason why he didn’t kill them wasn’t because he was benevolent, but they were simply ants in his eyes. Would a human care about the life and death of an ant? Everyone on the ranking was a prideful figure, so they wouldn’t bother killing ants.

But the real reason why he didn’t make his move was because someone had appeared. It was a stranger donned in azure clothes who carried a sword box. Although this person wasn’t on the ranking, the aura coming from him was extraordinary.

This shocked Guo Xu briefly before he spoke out, “Didn’t your seniors tell you to escape immediately if you ran into someone on the ranking? Report your name. If you’re from the nine overlord forces, I can consider sparing your life.”

His words were arrogant, but at the same time, they were understandable. After all, Lin Yun was only in the pinnacle Yin stage in his eyes, not even in the Yang stage. There was no way Lin Yun could be compared to geniuses on the ranking, even if he had an extraordinary temperament.

“I’m afraid that you’ll be disappointed. I’m not a disciple of the nine overlord forces. But you can give me a try if you want to fight,” said Lin Yun without any change on his face.

His words surprised Guo Xu. This person clearly knew that he was someone on the ranking, but he still had the confidence to face him? Could it be that this person had a trump card?

As thoughts swiftly crossed his mind, Guo Xu soon figured it out. Lin Yun must have a trump card. Otherwise, it would make no sense for him to stand before him. Since Lin Yun had shown himself and since he wasn't a disciple of an overlord force, he must have his own means.

“Take my punch!” Guo Xu threw out his punch in the next second. Even if Lin Yun had his own trump cards, Lin Yun was only qualified to talk to him if he could survive his attack. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

As Guo Xu poured his origin energy into his fist, it began to crackle with lightning and created several cracks on the ground. His punch was like a bolt of lightning that could instantly take the life of someone in the greater Yang stage.

The wind coming from Guo Xu’s fist made Lin Yun’s hair flutter and he could even feel a slight sting on his face. He was like a stubborn old tree that would shatter in the next second, but the light in his eyes was still as sharp as ever.

As the ancient dracophant energy spread throughout his body, it merged with his strength and sword energy. Then, Lin Yun threw a punch towards Guo Xu. When their fists clashed, a loud explosion rang out in the hall and fine cracks spread out on the wall. In the next second, both of them flew backwards.

Guo Xu took a deep breath as he looked at Lin Yun with shock. Lin Yun had perfectly fused his sword intent, strength, and origin energy together. This was how Lin Yun made up for the gap in his cultivation. If he didn’t do this, Lin Yun would be killed from a single fist.

Even Guo Xu was fearful of Lin Yun’s sword intent and he knew that he couldn’t let Lin Yun go alive. In the blink of an eye, Guo Xu made his decision. After all, it would be a disaster to let Lin Yun continue to grow. Since he had run into Lin Yun, he might as well kill him.

“Die!” Guo Xu’s aura underwent a transformation as the killing aura around him began to boil, making him look like a ferocious beast. When he stomped his foot on the ground, the entire hall trembled.

In the next second, he bolted towards Lin Yun. There might not be any tricks behind his punch, but the power behind it could even heavily injure a pinnacle Yang stage if they weren’t careful.

As the wind from the fist blew towards Lin Yun, Lin Yun looked like a small sapling under the storm. It was as if he would get uprooted at any point in time.

The Flower Burial Sword within the sword box began to react to Guo Xu’s killing aura. But Lin Yun didn’t resort to using the Flower Burial Sword as it was in the process of being upgraded right now. If he used it now, all his efforts would go down the drain. But facing that terrifying punch, Lin Yun knew that it was impossible for him to block it without using his sword.

Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes as he grabbed onto a piece of torn cloth. As he poured his origin energy into the cloth, it suddenly became straight like a sword and he used it to stab Guo Xu.

It was clearly a piece of cloth, but when Lin Yun stabbed out with it, a resounding sword buzz rang out. With that, a sword ray was the only thing left in the massive hall.

When the sword stabbed Guo Xu’s fist, lightning began to crackle. If Guo Xu’s punch was like a colossal mountain, then Lin Yun’s sword was like the moon’s essence that could shatter everything else. Even if Guo Xu was on the ranking, Lin Yun didn’t believe that he was inferior.

After a resounding explosion, they both stepped back and then charged at each other once more. In the blink of an eye, they exchanged over ten moves. But they didn’t take a step back as the fight began to grow even more intense.

Ten moves later, an explosion rang out in the sky and the cloth in Lin Yun’s hand exploded into pieces. Under another explosive shockwave, the two stepped back and looked at each other with surprise.

Guo Xu was covered in wounds caused by Lin Yun’s sword and his current appearance was terrible. But if one looked at him clearly, they would notice that all of them were superficial wounds.

On the other hand, Lin Yun’s right hand had blood dripping down. A cloth was ultimately a cloth, so there was no way it was comparable to the Flower Burial Sword. Then again, Lin Yun knew that he couldn’t use the Flower Burial Sword right now or all his effort would go down the drain.

Lin Yun knew that he had to bring out at least half of his trump cards in order to suppress his opponent. The difference between them wasn’t just their cultivation as Guo Xu was someone on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

Lin Yun might be shocked, but Guo Xu was even more shocked. After all, Lin Yun was only in the pinnacle Yin stage, while he was in the pinnacle Yang stage. Furthermore, he was a genius on the Dragoncloud Ranking that could easily deal with any pinnacle Yin stage cultivators, even if there were ten of them.

This moment solidified Guo Xu’s resolve to kill Lin Yun. He could tell that Lin Yun hadn’t use his trump cards. At the very least, Lin Yun never used the sword box he was carrying, so it wouldn’t be worth it for him to exhaust so much of his energy before the empyrean’s tomb. Especially if it was over some Profound Yin Water.

Guo Xu was puzzled, but while he was thinking over things, he heard footsteps coming from the hall. The footsteps made both Lin Yun and Guo Xu’s faces change. Guo Xu was certain that this newcomer was also a genius on the Dragoncloud Ranking.
