Chapter 733 - She’s Too Beautiful

Chu Muyan died a terrible death with a slap from Lin Yun that incinerated his bones. If he could still think right now, he would have regretted his decision to boast. If he didn’t boast that he reduced Lil’ Red’s corpse to ashes, Lin Yun would surely have let him die an easy death.

After all, using Qiongqi’s Strength greatly exhausted Lin Yun’s origin energy and the side effects were greater than using the Aurora Dragon’s Eyes. Lin Yun definitely wouldn’t use it if he had a choice. But since Chu Muyan asked for it, Lin Yun would fulfill his wish by slapping him to death.

Now, all of the seven geniuses had been killed by Lin Yun. In many people’s view, the three overlord forces set up the stages to recruit disciples. But the protagonists of the stages were never the seven geniuses. Lin Yun appeared once more and became their greatest nightmare as he vented his anger.

“You…” Everyone from Skycloud Sect, who had been filled with killing intent for Lin Yun, stopped and looked at him. Their faces were filled with shock. Why was someone in the lesser Yin-Yang stage so terrifying? He had merely used a palm to kill Chu Muyan.

Chu Muyan had already jumped off the stage, giving up the qualification to join the Indigomoon Elysium. But he was still killed by Lin Yun. This made the elders from the three overlord forces shocked as they looked at Lin Yun. They didn’t care about Chu Muyan’s death, nor the death of the other seven geniuses. But the potential that Lin Yun showed had far exceeded their expectations.

Lin Yun staggered as boundless exhaustion filled his body. He struggled to remain standing, but as long as he could endure this exhaustion, his vitality would help him swiftly recover. Tapping his interaptial pouch, Lin Yun retrieved dozens of pellets before stuffing them into his mouth.

The moment the pellets entered his mouth, Lin Yun’s heart began to beat wildly as the pellets were swiftly converted into vitality. As time passed, his pale face soon became rosy and a powerful aura came from his body once more.

“He’s going to escape!”

“Surround him! We can’t let this sword slave get away!” The various forces recovered from their shock when they saw Lin Yun retreating. All of them released a terrifying killing aura while they looked at Lin Yun with ugly faces.

The seven geniuses were the pride of Skymound City, especially Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu who had awakened their martial intent. But all of them were killed by Lin Yun, which greatly humiliated them.

“You guys really think highly of me,” smiled Lin Yun. Sweeping his glance around, he barked, “I’m here to kill, but I did it openly and uprightly. Death is disregarded the moment you stand on the stage. Where do you guys get the face to kill me?”

Lin Yun’s roar rumbled with sword intent. Not only the various forces, but the crowd also heard what he said. His words instantly caused the four clans and Skycloud Sect to start cursing inwardly because Lin Yun was calling them shameless.

When the foreign cultivators heard Lin Yun’s words, they shook their heads in disdain. This made Skymound City’s geniuses feel ashamed. It was already humiliating enough that the seven geniuses were killed by Lin Yun, not to mention that the various forces wanted to gang up on Lin Yun now.

Experts were respected in the martial world and Lin Yun had openly killed the seven geniuses, not to mention that it wasn’t fair that he fought all seven of them by himself. So the various forces were spoiling the rules when they tried to gang up on him. It seemed like none of them were willing to let him go.

“Alright then. You said you killed the six of them openly and uprightly. However, Chu Muyan jumped off the stage, so why did you still kill him? Do you think you can escape after killing Chu Muyan?” A cold voice sounded out from the crowd as he looked at Lin Yun coldly like venom. The one who spoke was Chen Wangye.

“That’s right. You killed our Skymound City’s geniuses. So how can we let you go!”

“Pay for their deaths with your life!”

“Sword slave, kneel and beg for forgiveness!” Chen Wangye’s words instantly caused everyone to start cursing Lin Yun. To them, Lin Yun had to die even if they didn’t have an excuse. But it was naturally even better since they have an excuse now.

Lin Yun smiles mockingly, “I’ll naturally kill those who want to kill me. Furthermore, didn’t you hear him beg me to kill him with a slap? All I did was fulfill his wish. Furthermore, when did I say anything about escaping?”

He already knew that these people wouldn’t let him go. But he was just trying to stall for enough time to recover from the exhaustion of using Qiongqi’s Strength. Escape? He never intended to escape because he hadn’t killed enough.

Boundless killing aura exploded from Lin Yun’s eyes along with a dragon roar from within his body. His gaze was sharp as he looked at Chen Wangye.

Is he suicidal? Everyone was shocked as they looked at Lin Yun. Did Lin Yun really want to kill a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm expert like Chen Wangye? Did he know the gap between them? Even if Lin Yun was powerful, the gap between him and a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm expert was unimaginable.

Chen Wangye could easily crush everything with his strength, so Lin Yun was simply courting death.

“You want to kill me? You must be courting death!” Chen Wangye smiled sinisterly. He naturally wanted Lin Yun to come after him.

Taking a step forward, Chen Wangye unleashed his aura with the Profound Note Bell rising up from his head. This was a replica, but it was still terrifying under his control. The Profound Note Bell had a terrifying radiance that no one could look at. With a cold smile, Chen Wangye said, “Do you remember this bell? Since I used this bell to torture you to death five days ago, I can naturally do it again!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

So it was him! Many people had shock in their eyes as they looked at Chen Wangye. There were rumours that this person was the one who suppressed Lin Yun five days ago. But they were just rumors. But now, he had personally admitted it. They finally understood why Lin Yun had such a great killing intent towards Chen Wangye. If someone else was in his position, they would also want to kill the seven geniuses.

“Kill me? You must be dreaming!” Lin Yun tapped his interspatial pouch and a whip appeared in his hand. The whip flickered with lightning as Lin Yun’s domineering aura surged with torrential purple flames. The whip was naturally the Indigoflame Thunderwhip.

The whip was Lei Yunzi’s strongest weapon. It was the only weapon in Ancient Southern Domain that transcended a cosmic artifact. Before coming here, the seal was already broken, so this was also Lin Yun’s greatest trump card. Today, he wanted to kill the seven geniuses and the shameless old goat named Chen Wangye.

“Kill!” Lin Yun roared as the Indigoflame Thunderwhip came to life and continued to swell. In the blink of an eye, it had turned into a ferocious dragon. The aura that the whip emitted left fear on many people’s faces as they quickly retreated.

As lightning flashed and radiated through the horizon, panic could be seen on everyone’s faces. As the dragon roared, the Profound Note Bell shattered in a single attack. This made Chen Wangye’s face change as he started to form seals to defend himself.

But the dragon manifested from the whip was too terrifying as it lashed on Chen Wangye’s body. This left a huge gash on Chen Wangye’s body.

“Old goat, kneel!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. His hatred for this person was a lot deeper than the seven geniuses. His wrist flicked and the whip wrapped around Chen Wangye who wanted to escape. Then, lightning tore his skin apart.

“No! No! Please, don’t kill me!” Chen Wangye panicked. However, no matter how much he struggled, he couldn’t break free. In fact, whenever he struggled, the whip would tighten its grip and dig into his muscles and bones.

“Die!” Lin Yun tugged the whip to pull Chen Wangye over before stepping on his head and causing blood to spill everywhere. Just like that, a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm expert was killed by Lin Yun with a stomp.

“Enough!” Right at this moment, a cold bark rang out as Lin Yun was sent flying. Qing Ruoyou finally stood up from the Indigomoon Elysium’s seat with her face darkened and cold. She was emitting the aura in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm and she was the one who attacked earlier.

Even now, she looked at Lin Yun from high up with loathing in her eyes, “I already said that you weren’t fit to force me to make a move. But you’re really loathsome, like a pesky fly!”

When she finished, a terrifying purple moonlight surged around her as she pushed her palm out at Lin Yun.

Taking the attack head-on, Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood. Wearing a sinister smile, Lin Yun looked at Qing Ruoyou and spoke coldly, “Bitch.”

When Lin Yun called Qing Ruoyou a bitch, everyone began to panic. Even the various forces also started to panic because they were afraid that Qing Ruoyou’s rage would implicate them.

The elders and disciples behind Qing Ruoyou also stood up as they looked at Lin Yun with killing intent surging in their eyes. Anyone who dared to disgrace the princess of their Indigomoon Elysium must die!

Qing Ruoyou raised her hand to stop them and said, “Let him. Since I’ve made a move, let me squash this fly myself. I rarely kill anyone, so consider it an honor to die in my hand!”

But just when she was about to go down, an unprecedented chill swept out along with a cold voice, “Bitch, take a step forward if you dare and see if anyone can save you.”

Who said that?! Everyone’s faces changed as they turned. But the moment they turned their heads, they covered their eyes because the light was too dazzling. The one who spoke was too beautiful, like a bright sun shining in the sky.
