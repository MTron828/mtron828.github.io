Chapter 258 - Blood Rose

The man and tiger stood in the valley, confronting each other. An intense pain burdened Lin Yun’s body since his origin energy was exhausted, but he didn’t retreat and held the Flower Burial Sword tightly. He knew that taking a step back at this moment would mean death.

The enormous tiger stared at Lin Yun coldly while blood flowed down from its neck. Neither of them made a move as they both waited for an opportunity to kill their opponent. Comparatively, Lin Yun was in a better state despite being whipped by the python’s tail. It wasn’t a fatal wound, so Lin Yun could afford to push off treatment for the time being.

On the other hand, the golden tiger’s blood poured out like a stream, not to mention that it still had wounds from the ape and bear. The tiger would die if it continued, but Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless. He was afraid that the tiger would launch a fatal attack right before its death. After all, he had personally witnessed the golden tiger kill two lord-rank demonic beasts.

He knew that there was no way he could take a hit from the golden tiger in his current state. The two of them would surely die if they dragged this out. Looking at the tiger, Lin Yun thought about how it wasn’t the same as other demonic beasts.

“Can you understand me?” asked Lin Yun. The tiger blinked its eyes in response. Lin Yun saw this as an opportunity to communicate with the tiger. He then pointed at the wound on the tiger’s neck and the alluring rose and said, “I can save you, but the flower goes to me.”

The tiger hesitated briefly before it raised its claw without any warning. Lin Yun’s face changed when he saw the tiger making a move and poured his sword intent into the Flower Burial Sword. However, the tiger did not attack him. On the contrary, it pointed at the Flower Burial Sword. “You’re telling me to put down the sword?” asked Lin Yun.

The tiger nodded lightly, almost like a docile cat and not a ferocious demonic beast who had just fought three lord-rank demonic beasts.

Lin Yun hesitated briefly before he plunged the sword into the ground. He let out a breath of relief when he saw the tiger also letting out a breath of relief instead of pouncing at him. “I’m going to come over now,” said Lin Yun.

Seeing that the tiger wasn’t against it, he walked over to the tiger and crawled up its enormous body to get to the neck. Lin Yun took a deep breath when he saw the wound. The wound was horrible. It emitted black miasma and the smell of rotten flesh. Thankfully, Lin Yun had been dealing with the Dragon Blooded Horse’s injuries while they were out, so he was familiar with treating demonic beasts.

First, he removed the poisonous fangs that were left behind. Then, he applied medicine on the wound and bandaged it up. The golden tiger closed its eyes while Lin Yun worked.

After a brief moment, Lin Yun let out a long breath, signaling that he had finished. He jumped off the tiger and turned his head to look at the tiger. Rays of sunlight shined down on the tiger, making it seem more like a peaceful old man instead of a king.

“This tiger is definitely not simple.” Lin Yun had seen many demonic beasts that were cunning, violent, ferocious, and domineering, but he had never seen such a unique tiger. He turned around and looked at the three lord-rank demonic beasts with a flicker of joy in his eyes.

He knew that he could make a fortune with the three beast cores. After all, the Primal Origin Sect’s disciples felt heartache for a long time when they lost the Bloodwolf King’s beast core. He couldn’t imagine how valuable the sixth stage Profound Martial Realm lord-rank beast cores would be.

“I just reached the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm and I don’t have many resources. I can make good use of this opportunity. I might even be able to use the beast cores to reach the fourth stage!” Lin Yun’s cultivation wasn’t high, so the beast cores provided him with many possibilities.

He also had to leave something for Lil’ Red. There were still other treasures on these demonic beasts, like the python’s gallbladder, the bear’s palm, and the ape’s heart. Those parts of the demonic beasts contained over a hundred years of spiritual energy essence. If they didn’t, then the three demonic beasts wouldn’t be able to form King Aura.

The demonic beasts were massive, so Lin Yun spent half an hour harvesting his rewards. He placed the three beast cores in front of him. The beast cores seemed alive. They contained boundless crimson aura and dozens of King Aura strands. They were vastly greater than the Bloodwolf King’s beast core.

After Lin Yun stored the beast cores, he walked over to retrieve the Flower Burial Sword. When the sword left the ground, its body trembled. Right at this moment, the golden tiger opened its eyes and looked at Lin Yun’s sword with fear flashing across its eyes.

“Time to get down to business!” Lin Yun walked towards the Blood Rose. The Blood Rose stood proudly amidst the mess. But just when Lin Yun was about to come in contact with the flower, the flower popped and dissipated like a bubble.

The flower reappeared a few feet away. Lin Yun frowned and stretched his hands out, leaving afterimages behind him. However, no matter how hard he tried, he wasn’t able to touch the flower.

“Interesting…” Lin Yun rubbed his nose. He plunged the Flower Burial Sword beside the flower. Since the sword fed on the flower’s fragrance, he didn’t need to pluck the flower. When the sword plunged into the ground, it released a dream-like phantom that rippled out. Then, the flower’s fragrance actually began to condense before Lin Yun’s eyes.

Lin Yun reached out at the crimson ripple, but he wasn’t able to touch anything. He looked at the Blood Rose that stood proudly only to find it leaning on the sword like a woman. Simultaneously, the sword intent in the sword grew stronger under the fragrance’s nourishment.

Lin Yun held onto his chin. He found this scene to be refreshing. He had heard of gifting swords to beauties, but he had never heard of a beautiful flower being infatuated with a sword. After all, the flower was dodging him earlier.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun could hear gentle footsteps quietly walking over. It was the golden tiger and it was meaningfully looking at Lin Yun. Lin Yun pondered briefly before reaching his hand out. The golden tiger did the same and gently poked Lin Yun’s fingertips with its claw.

The tiger then pointed at the Flower Burial Sword. Lin Yun followed the tiger’s instructions and dripped his blood on the sword. His blood came in contact with the sword and perfectly fused with it.

The flower swayed around happily. Suddenly, countless crimson petals fell off the flower. Lin Yun reached out for a petal only to watch it disappear. When he took a closer look, he realized that the Blood Rose was actually merging with the Flower Burial Sword. It didn’t take long for the Blood Rose to disappear completely.

Lin Yun walked up to the sword and pulled it out of the ground. He noticed that there were some additional crimson patterns on the sword’s body that caused it to look drastically different than before. It had formed many natural patterns.

When Lin Yun held onto the sword, his face changed. The Flower Burial Sword had now reached the level of a transcendent-grade profound artifact. While holding the sword, Lin Yun could sense that he was connected to it as though it were a part of his body.

The Iris Flower in his Dantian blossomed and he started pouring origin energy into the sword. The sword intent in the sword began to buzz and countless crimson petals appeared. They stirred about in the surroundings to create a dreamy scene.

“It’s not a cosmic artifact, but it’s comparable to one.” Lin Yun was emotional when he held onto the Flower Burial Sword. The Flower Burial Sword had gone from a mid-grade profound artifact to a sword that’s comparable to a cosmic artifact. With this sword, the might of his sword technique would be greatly boosted.

When Lin Yun swung his sword within the storm of crimson petals, his figure actually looked illusory. After a while, Lin Yun returned the sword to its sheath and laughed. The moment the sword entered the sheath, the crimson petals in the surroundings disappeared. It was as if everything was a dream.

“What a great sword!” rejoiced Lin Yun. He then immediately thanked the tiger. It was all thanks to the tiger’s guidance that the Flower Burial Sword absorbed the Blood Rose. The tiger then pointed at Lin Yun then pointed towards the valley’s depths.

“You want me to come with you?” asked Lin Yun.

The tiger nodded and started walking deeper into the valley. The tiger’s actions intrigued Lin Yun, so he followed it. He knew that someone must have enlightened this tiger. Was the tiger going to bring him to meet with its owner?
