Chapter 2113 - Fearless!

The golden liquid was dazzling in the night. Lin Yun instantly linked it with the Buddhist Emperor’s Saint Blood that Lil’ Purple mentioned. If this was really the saint blood of a Buddhist Emperor, this tree was a divine tree capable of producing countless Buddhist Emperor Relics.

The tree was a supreme treasure with many secrets and could be refined into a divine weapon. Just thinking about it was enough to make Lin Yun excited.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

But suddenly, he was alerted by his Azure Dragon Sword Heart, and his heart began to throb violently. The withered tree branches were like hundreds of spears stabbing towards him. Everything happened too quickly, so Lin Yun couldn’t avoid them in time. He could only swing the Flower Burial Sword, creating sparks that flew around when the sword clashed with the branches. This shocked Lin Yun because he actually failed to cut those branches with the Astral Sword Intent empowering the Flower Burial Sword.

But before he could feel shocked, dozens of branches pierced his body like sharp spears. Lil’ Purple, who had been cautious, knocked away the rest of the branches, but she also didn’t expect the attack to be so fast. When she looked back, Lin Yun was held into the air by the tree branches, and a terrifying devouring energy was coming from the branches. In just a brief moment, Lin Yun’s vitality and nirvana aura were endlessly being devoured.

Lin Yun tried to resist with his sword intent, but what happened next was even more terrifying. The Golden Lotus Flametree was devouring his sword intent to nourish itself.

“Lil’ Red!” Lil’ Purple yelled as she blocked the incoming branches.

Lil’ Red appeared from the Iris Secret Realm, turning into its Dracoape form, and forcibly dragged Lin Yun away. When Lin Yun was dragged away, there were ten-odd holes on his body with blood gushing out, and the pain even made his face distorted. When the branches stabbed into his body, he couldn’t feel any pain. But when he was pulled away from those tree branches, he nearly fainted from the pain.

“Shrink down.” Lin Yun knew how terrifying the Golden Lotus Flametree was and quickly reminded Lil’ Red to shrink in size. Otherwise, Lil’ Red would be a huge target for the Golden Lotus Flametree.

Lin Yun bore the pain as his gaze became sharp. Once the Flower Burial Sword returned to its sheath, he reached out and unleashed the Black Thunder Chains. The nine chains flew out and dragged Lil’ Purple over. When Lin Yun embraced Lil' Purple, he tapped his foot on the ground and quickly retreated, running towards a stone Buddha statue and hid behind it.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye. Lin Yun had nearly lost his life. The Golden Lotus Flametree was too bizarre. Just thinking about it made Lin Yun feel a lingering fear. After he confirmed that there was no movement from the Golden Lotus Flametree, he finally relaxed, but the pain throughout his body assaulted his consciousness.

“Quick, heal your injuries. Don’t faint,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun endured the intense pain and sat down, circulating the blue dragon aura from the Blue Dragon Bone throughout his body. While the blue dragon aura flowed throughout his body, his injuries began to recover, and Lil’ Purple heaved a sigh of relief when she saw this scene.

At this moment, Lil’ Purple blamed herself for not warning Lin Yun about the dangers of the Golden Lotus Flametree. But it was also because she had underestimated the Golden Lotus Flametree. It definitely didn’t just fuse with the Golden Body of a Buddhist Emperor. There had to be other secrets to it.

“Lord Phoenix, you’re bleeding.” Lil’ Red suddenly spoke up, looking at Lil’ Purple.

“Hush!” Lil’ Purple raised her finger to her lips and glared at Lil’ Red. This frightened Lil’ Red to the point that it didn’t dare to say another word. Lil’ Purple had to admit it was rather painful. She examined her injuries and knew that there must be other secrets to the Golden Lotus Flametree that she didn’t know about.

She looked over towards the Golden Lotus Flametree and fell into deep thoughts while observing it. To be so aggressive, it didn’t seem to be like the Golden Lotus Flametree that she knew about. It possessed a ferocity and holy nature of Buddhism, but it didn’t possess any evil traits. Rather than a tree, it looked more like a weapon instead.

Looking at it, she suddenly thought of a possibility and a story from ancient times. She looked at the Golden Lotus Flametree with her eyes flickering. She muttered, “Could it be…?”

“What’s the matter?” Lin Yun suddenly appeared beside her, disrupting her thoughts.

“I thought of a possibility. This Golden Lotus Flametree might have been refined by a powerhouse during ancient times, and the Fleeting Sky Monastery might have a huge origin,” Lil’ Purple explained.

“Let’s not care about that for now. Why didn’t you tell me that you’re also injured? Let me treat your injuries for you.” Lin Yun noticed Lil’ Purple’s injuries. After all, she helped him block the attacks from the branches, which was why she was injured. Even after so long, her injuries still hadn’t healed, making Lin Yun feel heartache.

Normally speaking, Lil’ Purple would argue with him, but she was quiet this time. Once Lin Yun poured the blue dragon aura into her body, Lil' Purple didn’t take long to recover from her injuries. The Golden Lotus Flametree was terrifying, but the injuries it inflicted were superficial. The horror of the Golden Lotus Flametree laid in its devouring ability.

“There’s something weird about this Golden Lotus Flametree. It can even devour my Astral Sword Intent. One must know that even a Saint would carelessly dare to come in contact with the Astral Sword Intent,” Lin Yun said with a grave expression. He wasn’t boasting because the Astral Sword Intent was a martial intent only saints could comprehend. Lin Yun’s Astral Sword Intent had nearly reached the pinnacle of complete mastery, and even a saint wouldn’t dare to come into contact with it.

“You just lack the empowerment of a greater dao. If you have the empowerment of a greater dao, everything would be different. This Golden Lotus Flametree must’ve used the power of a saint dao, the Devour Dao. It’s also one of the thirty-six Sovereign Daos,” Lil’ Purple explained.

“What should we do now?” Lin Yun asked. The Golden Lotus Flametree was unusual, and he nearly lost his life. Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling a chill just thinking about it. But it also wasn’t his style to give up now. It would make no sense if he leaves emptyhanded when he just brushed past death.

“Someone’s here!” Just when Lil’ Purple was about to speak, she and Lin Yun sensed a Quasi-Saint’s aura, so they quickly hid with Lil’ Red.

The cave was dark, but it couldn’t obstruct the sight of a Quasi-Saint. Lin Yun sent Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red into the Iris Secret Realm before he activated the Divine Tortoise Transformation and wore the Silver Moon Mask to contain his aura within his body.

“Divine Son, the tree is still around. Those people really don’t have any eyesight.” A familiar voice resounded. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw the Orangeclothed Venerable. Of the four Venerables, he was unharmed, while the other three were heavily injured. As for the person standing beside him, it was naturally the Blood Moon Divine Son, Zhao Tianyu.

“Why are they here?” Lin Yun was baffled, but he soon thought of something. During the day, Zhao Tianyu once said that he was here to take the Golden Lotus Flametree with him. Back then, Lin Yun felt that Zhao Tianyu was boasting and didn’t think much about it, not to mention Zhao Tianyu left after Bai Qingyu gave him a few Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses.

But it looked like Zhao Tianyu really was here for the Golden Lotus Flametree. Initially, his objective wasn’t the Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses but the Golden Lotus Flametree itself.

“Divine Son, are we going to make a move here?” The Orangeclothed Venerable looked excited.

“No need to hurry.” Zhao Tianyu maintained his elegant appearance. Purple lightning began to fill his eyes, and the entire cave was as brightly lit as it was during the day.

“You look around.” Zhao Tianyu’s hair fluttered, his elegant temperament becoming overbearing.

He could confirm if anyone was here with his Divine Lightning Eyes, but he was cautious and wanted the Orangeclothed Venerable to look around.

The Orangeclothed Venerable swiftly charged around the cave, and when he approached the statue Lin Yun was hiding behind. But he merely glanced at the statue before he left. He landed on the statue and gazed around before returning to Zhao Tianyu’s side. But he didn’t notice that Lin Yun was three meters away from his head, stuck to the cave ceiling.

“There’s no one here. But the Golden Lotus Flametree’s leaves are gone,” the Orangeclothed Venerable reported. He didn’t look any closer, so he didn’t notice the small cut on the tree bark.

Zhao Tianyu deactivated the Divine Lightning Eyes and calmly said, “Those from the other domains should have done it, but we don’t have to care about that.”

He was concerned that Bai Yunfeng or Ji Haoyu might have noticed something and attracted the saints of their sects. But he did not need to worry about that now.

“Let’s make a move,” Zhao Tianyu said, looking at the Golden Lotus Flametree.

The Orangeclothed Venerable quickly made a move. He took out a jade bottle that had a golden powder and formed an ancient array around the Golden Lotus Flametree with it.

This spiritual array was profound and looked like a cult ceremony. The Orangeclothed Venerable was wearing a revered expression as he set up the array.

“This is an ancient sacrificial array. It uses at least eight ancient saint runes. Come to think of it, this is a simplified version of the Myriad Demon Sacrificial Array. It’s no wonder why I initially failed to recognize it. It’s been heavily simplified. But what is he trying to do?” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the Iris Secret Realm. Lin Yun frowned upon hearing that.

He felt that the Blood Moon Divine Son was making a huge move. A brief moment later, the simplified version of the Myriad Demon Sacrifical Array was set up, and the array was so complicated that it made Lin Yun feel dazzled. Looking from afar, it looked like countless flowers had overlapped one another.

“Take out the sacrificial item,” Zhao Tianyu said.

The Orangeclothed Venerable looked excited as he took out the corpse of a Quasi-Saint demonic beast from his interspatial bracelet and threw it over at the array. When the corpse hung on the Golden Lotus Flametree, the tree started to swiftly devour it, and it didn’t take long for bones to be left behind.

This scene frightened the Orangeclothed Venerable, before he quickly threw out more corpses that belonged to Quasi-Saint demonic beasts. The corpses were all Quasi-Saint demonic beasts, but none were identical. The Orangeclothed Venerable threw out a total of a hundred demonic beast corpses.

At the same time, Zhao Tianyu also moved while arranging various treasures that he had obtained on the Myriad Demon Sacrifical Array.

“Divine Son, I’m running out of corpses,” the Orangeclothed Venerable uneasily said. The Golden Lotus Flametree also became weird. It was clearly devouring those corpses, but it was slowly shrinking in size, slowly looking like a weapon. But a hundred Quasi-Saint demonic beasts didn’t seem to be able to satisfy the Golden Lotus Flametree.

Zhao Tianyu calmly threw out a Saint Realm demonic beast. The size of this demonic beast was several hundred meters, and even though it was dead, it still gave off a terrifying saint aura.

The Golden Lotus Flametree seemed excited by the Saint Realm demonic beast’s corpse and started devouring it like it was a feast.

“It should be enough now,” the Orangeclothed Venerable uneasily said, wiping the sweat on his forehead.

“It’s still not enough. I have prepared ten droplets of divine blood for this,” Zhao Tianyu said, squinting his eyes. He stood with his hands behind him, as though everything was within his control.

Seeing that Zhao Tianyu was really making a huge move, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling uneasy because Zhao Tianyu seemed to be doing something even bigger than what Lil’ Purple said.

“Hehe. Let’s see what he’s doing first. No need to hurry,” Lil’ Purple said from within the Iris Secret Realm. She was excited because she didn’t expect such a huge surprise.

But Lin Yun didn’t dare to reply because he sensed that Zhao Tianyu was difficult to deal with. But Lin Yun had a look of madness beneath his mask without a hint of fear. So what if Zhao Tianyu was a divine son? At this moment, Lil’ Purple and Lin Yun didn’t seem to know the meaning of ‘fear.’
