Chapter 962 - Great Boost in Strength!

With Liu Mu leading the four higher realms, preparations were swiftly made. As for Lin Yun, the Divine Core in his palm shined brightly while blazing energy poured into his body. When the energy poured into his body, he was enveloped with the boundless astral energy.

The astral energy around him was so dense that it manifested into a liquid form. Under the radiance of the Divine Core, the liquid astral energy had a golden glow. If someone were present, they would be shocked by the sheer amount of astral energy.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

As the astral energy slowly poured into Lin Yun’s body, another soul within Lin Yun’s body was unlocked before it formed a new aura ocean. The moment this aura ocean unlocked, he would have a great boost in origin energy, physique, vitality, and cultivation.

This transformation was only possible with 3,000 divine astral pellets and a Divine Core. It was ten times greater than what normal people could attempt.

Lin Yun’s new aura ocean was smoothly formed. After all, Lin Yun had a firm foundation and just needed an opportunity to help him. Now that he found that opportunity, he could easily reach the second soul Heavenly Soul realm.

Then again, he still needed to face the tribulation. His aura ocean expanded while a majestic aura emitted from his body. All of his pores opened up and released a sacred light. In the blink of an eye, the origin energy in his aura ocean reached over a few thousand meters, which scared Lin Yun.

It was already an impressive feat if someone refined five million astral pellets in their second tribulation. After all, geniuses like Liu Mu exhausted about eight million astral pellets for their third tribulation. But now, Lin Yun used 3,000 divine astral pellets, which was equivalent to thirty million astral pellets!

“Second soul Heavenly Soul Realm!” After reaching the limit of his physique, Lin Yun slowly opened his eyes that were shining with golden light. Clenching his fist and circulating his aura oceans at the same time, Lin Yun sensed boundless origin energy in his body. He wasn’t inferior to the likes of Xu Que anymore. After all, he refined a Divine Core and 3,000 divine astral pellets.

“The tribulation is coming…” The depths of Lin Yun’s eyes blazed as insanity flashed through his eyes. He wanted to see just how terrifying his tribulation was and if he could break his limit with the tribulation.

Thunderclouds started to gather in the sky as countless bolts of lightning flashed. The lightning continued to flash as it formed a ferocious beast. When the beast unleashed its roar, it caused the heavens and earth to tremble violently.

It was a truly shocking scene, especially when the lightning beast normally appeared in the third tribulation. It was somewhat bizarre that Lin Yun ran into it in his second tribulation.

“Interesting.” Lin Yun squinted his eyes as his face became grave. He could sense that this tribulation was much more terrifying than before. Then, the thunderclouds tumbled and a bolt of lightning descended. The lightning bolt transformed into a gigantic claw that wanted to tear Lin Yun apart.

But just when it was about to descend, the ancient array lit up brightly as a dragon flew out. The dragon managed to knock the beast claw backwards, enraging the ferocious beast even more.

Lightning continued to rain down as the ferocious beast revealed the top half of its body. It was a gigantic wolf made of lightning.

Lin Yun started to feel some pressure as the ancient array wasn’t able to block the entire tribulation. But Lin Yun didn’t panic and absorbed the bolts of lightning with his body. Just like that, the demonic wolf descended from the sky when its attacks were rendered useless.

Simultaneously, the ancient array was also pushed to the limit as a boundless dragon aura soared into the sky. When the array clashed with the ferocious beast, dazzling sparks of lightning flew out. The collision was so strong that the array even started to crumble. However, the demonic wolf looked as mighty as ever as it continued its descent.

“Watch it!” Lin Yun barked. No one else would dare to be as impulsive as Lin Yun was. However, Lin Yun’s foundation was so deep that he wasn’t afraid of the lightning beast.

His sword intent swept through the sky and covered him just as the demonic wolf was about to get him. At the same time, Lin Yun pushed his sword sutras to the limit, using them to grind down the demonic wolf and weaken it.

However, the lightning beast roared as violent lightning bolts flew around. Even with his sword intent protecting him, he could feel the stinging pain when the lightning hit his body. The pain made his lips twitch uncontrollably as cold light flashed in his eyes. It lasted for a while before the demonic wolf’s power was cut in half.

“Cut!” When the lightning beast was weakened, Lin Yun brought out his sky sword intent to tear the lightning beast into pieces. Normally, the tribulation was a dangerous event, but Lin Yun managed to destroy it with one strike.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun sat down and closed his eyes. His sword aura enveloped the remaining lightning in the atmosphere. Lin Yun slowly absorbed the lightning and used it to refine his newly opened aura ocean.

Just like that, the surrounding lightning formed a cocoon around Lin Yun. He was undergoing a transformation within the cocoon and started to grow stronger at a terrifying speed. A violent aura came from the cocoon that lasted for half a day.

With that, Lin Yun’s second tribulation had finally come to an end. Although he was shocked when the lightning manifested into a ferocious beast, it still wasn’t enough to threaten Lin Yun inside the ancient array.

Cracks started to appear on the cocoon before it exploded. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, a sword hum rang out that was accompanied by a dragon roar. Then, Lin Yun’s violent aura burst out, displaying the might of his cultivation that was now in the pinnacle second soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

When Lin Yun clenched his fist and circulated both sword sutras, he could sense his origin energy contained terrifying power. Throwing his punch out, the space before him was like a frozen lake that shattered before manifesting into a powerful gale.

Sweeping his glance around to look at the surrounding demonic corpses, Lin Yun circulated both sword sutras at the same time. With a wave of his hand, the surrounding demonic corpses were gathered under his aura as he tested his punch. With a dazzling sword ray exploding from his palm, the demonic corpses were erased from existence.

Looking at this scene, Lin Yun’s pupils flashed with joy. He could sense the immense growth in his origin energy after completing his tribulation. Fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses couldn’t pose a threat to him anymore. If he executed the Divine Glorysun Fist again, it would be a lot more terrifying than before. After all, an advanced fortune martial technique like that exhausted a great amount of origin energy. So if he didn’t have enough origin energy, he wouldn’t be able to unleash its full might.

“I’m finally at the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm!” Lin Yun smiled. Lin Yun couldn’t wait to test his power against Xu Que and his cronies.
