Chapter 1821 - Join Hands

When the four of them retreated, the totem moved, and black flames ignited on the forehead of the nine skeletons. When a devilish aura was being emitted from those skeletons, they let out a bizarre scream, and the ten-odd people who got close to them were injured by the soundwaves.

When those nine skeletons began to move, the faces of everyone in this region changed. This was because they realized that these nine skeletons weren’t corpses of the Black Tortoise’s lineage but the Ancient Demonspirit Clan who invaded. They were all killed in a split second.

They were only suppressed by the totems. Although they had lost their intelligence, they still contained terrifying power. When waves of demonic aura swept out, they exploded from the nine Ancient Demonspirit Clan’s skeletons, making the sky become dark.

“Pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage…” Mei Zihua glanced at the demonspirits before he started trembling. The fact that those skeletons were so powerful even after their deaths, they were probably Quasi-Saints when they were alive.

“Everyone doesn't have to be so anxious. This totem must be a sacred artifact of the Black Tortoise Clan, and these skeletons are already dead. We don’t have to be afraid of them!” Just when everyone was horrified, someone greedily said.

“Sacred artifact?” Everyone’s thoughts began to process this when they heard what the previous person said. They came here because they sensed that something was amiss, and there was a high chance that the treasure here was the totem.

“Let’s go!” Someone finally couldn’t hold it back, and they began to unleash attacks at the nine demonspirit corpses. The corpses were only left with skeletons. Although they might possess pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage strength, there was no way they could confront over a hundred people that were present. So they had a high chance of winning if they fought.

“How foolish.” Gu Jun cursed. He didn’t care what Lin Yun, An Liuyan, and Mei Zihua thought and immediately left without any hesitation.

This naturally made the three briefly stunned, before they quickly followed after him. When they caught up to Gu Jun, An Liuyan asked, “Elder Gu, is the Black Tortoise Totem really a sacred artifact?”

Nodding his head, Gu Jun replied, “It’s a sacred artifact, but it’s used to seal saints, and it’s called the Demon Sealing Pillar. It requires a secret technique to be activated, and it’s useless even if someone else obtains it.”

“The Demon Sealing Pillar? Does that mean there are more corpses under the totem?” Lin Yun asked, raising his brow.

“You’re not stupid. Those nine corpses are nothing. But if the one beneath the totem breaks out…” Gu Jun smiled.

“What will happen?” Mei Zihua asked nervously.

“Not a single person will be left, and all of them will die!” Gu Jun said with a grave expression.

When Mei Zihua turned around, a lump of black clouds exploded from that region, killing everyone in that region. This instantly made his face pale, and he exclaimed, “They’re all dead!”

“They deserved it. A bunch of idiots who knew nothing. Just don’t implicate us in it.” Gu Jun said indifferently.

Right then, Lin Yun’s face changed, and there was a flash of surprise through his pupils.

“What’s wrong?” Gu Jun asked when he noticed Lin Yun’s unusual expression.

“You just had to say it… Those things are coming in our direction.” Lin Yun indifferently said, increasing his speed. Just a moment ago, even his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent sensed a wisp of danger, and this meant the corpse suppressed by the totem must be powerful.

Right then, the totem was lifted by a black-robed corpse out from the ground. In the next moment, the black-robed corpse ordered the nine skeletons to charge in their direction, raising a cloud of dust with a demonic aura covering the sky.

Seeing this, the group of four immediately sped up. But those ancient demonspirit corpses continued to chase after them, and the demonic aura they gave off was terrifying.

“Old man, why don’t we split up?” Lin Yun asked when he sensed that something wasn’t right. He suspected that those corpses were chasing after them because they sensed the Black Tortoise’s bloodline in Gu Jun’s body. Otherwise, it would make no sense for them to chase after them.

They did run into other cultivators along the way, but those nine corpses were fixated on them and ignored everyone else.

“Ha. You brat, who knows if it’s not because of the tortoiseshell on you? Why don’t you throw that away, first? They might not come after us anymore.” Gu Jun retorted.

Lin Yun’s heart clenched because there was that possibility. But he had no change on his face, and he said, “Let’s try splitting up and we’ll know which of us they are after.”

Hearing that, Gu Jun became nervous, and he said, “Don’t! We’re both from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. If anything happened to me, you can dream about going to the wine cellar! Let me tell you, you might be able to find demigod wine, Mo Clan’s wine, and even the Black Tortoise Lightning Pool there.”

Lin Yun’s face sank, and he instantly knew those demonic corpses were after Gu Jun now. He asked, “Those are rumors you heard again?”

“Let’s not dwell on that for now and find a way to resolve those things. We can’t go anywhere if they keep chasing us.” Gu Jun awkwardly smiled.

They naturally drew a lot of attention along the way, but most people were gloating after a brief shock. If they didn’t sense how powerful those corpses were, they might consider sneaking up and waiting for an opportunity.

“That thing might possess the power of the Saint Realm. Are you sure you have a way to deal with it?” Lin Yun asked.

“They’re already dead, so your sword intent is effective against them. If you can block them head-on, I might have a solution…” Gu Jun said, rolling his eyes.

Block them head-on? The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched, and he replied, “You must be dreaming. Don’t forget that I’m only at the Dragon Pulse Realm.”

But Lin Yun was just complaining, and he soon made a decision and stopped. With a cold light flickering within his pupils, he instructed, “Liuyan, try and find a way to deal with those skeletons. As for the Ancient Demonspirit’s corpse, I’ll find away to deal with it.”

“Okay.” An Liuyan nodded.

“You… be careful.” Lin Yun added.

An Liuyan immediately felt warmth in her heart because she knew Lin Yun was worried about her. She said, “I will pay attention to it.”

“W-What should I do, then?” Mei Zihua was nervous, but his pupils were flickering with excitement and his hands began to tremble.

“Try not to make a move.” Lin Yun replied.

“What?” Mei Zihua froze with his mouth wide open. What does that mean?

“He’s telling you not to play your flute. God knows what will be lured over, and it’s best if you do nothing.” Gu Jun rolled his eyes.

The corner of Mei Zihua’s lips twitched. Just when he wanted to say something, a huge shadow loomed over them, and they charged out.

The Black Tortoise Totem fell to the ground, causing a huge explosion that created a horrifying ravine. This was initially meant to seal the demonspirits, but it was used as a weapon against them now.

The black demonspirit corpse was rather complete with flesh, and it had a vertical eye on its forehead that emitted a terrifying demonic aura. This demonspirit corpse swept his gaze through the four people. Mei Zihua didn’t even dare to take a huge breath, and his body was trembling. In the end, the demonspirit corpse’s eyes alternated between Lin Yun and Gu Jun, trying to find the real target.

“Flicking Divine Finger!” Lin Yun couldn’t wait any longer, and his thumb pressed down on his middle finger. As a massive sword aura swept out, it swiftly spread over ten miles in length. The Iris Saint Seal on the back of Lin Yun’s hand also began to shine.

But he didn’t stop there and circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, summoning a Netherflower that was a few hundred feet wide beneath him before pouring the nether energy and azure dragon energy into the Iris Saint Seal.

When an Azure Dragon’s roar echoed, Lin Yun flicked his finger and a massive sword ray shot out from his finger and struck the ancient demonspirit’s corpse. This instantly sent the demonspirit’s corpse ten-odd miles away.

The nine skeletons were left, and they quickly pounced at the four. Right then, a blood moon rose behind An Liuyan, and she tossed the fan in her hand. A white dragon appeared and coiled around her, and she flew towards the nine skeletons like a streak of light.

Mei Zihua finally couldn’t hold himself down, and took out a jade flute before raising it to his lips. But the moment he raised his hands, he could sense two murderous gazes directed at him. This naturally made Mei Zihua feel aggrieved. After all, he was the descendant of a musical clan, a genius who grasped the Great Saint Tune. This made his cheeks tremble, but he ultimately lowered the flute.

As for the ancient demonspirit corpse that was sent flying away, it grabbed onto the Black Tortoise Totem and soared to the sky, swinging it down like a staff.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’ll have some fun with you, then.” A cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils. He stomped his foot on the ground before he soared to the sky. As a thunderstorm accompanied him, he raised his hand and executed the Azure Dragon Grasp.

With a loud explosion, a massive dragon claw shrouded in a thunderstorm grabbed onto the descending totem. This made his face sink, and he could feel the great pressure because there were fine cracks spreading out on the claw.

Three breaths later, the azure dragon claw shattered, and this made Lin Yun feel turmoil in his internal organs. But as a ferocious light flashed across his pupils, he raised his hand and executed the Flicking Divine Finger, attracting the ancient demonspirit corpse’s attention over.

The ancient demonspirit corpse wasn’t hit this time, and it swung the Black Tortoise Totem to destroy the incoming sword ray. But Lin Yun had no change on his face, and unleashed more sword rays through the Flicking Divine Finger.

This covered the sky in sword aura with thunderstorms violently roaring along with a series of terrifying explosions. Lin Yun didn’t dare to get too close to the ancient demonspirit corpse, but he couldn’t get close to it no matter how he tried anyways. As for the ancient demonspirit corpse, it was too terrifying, and was slowly approaching him, no matter how Lin Yun tried to stop it.

Very quickly, Lin Yun drew his sword and faced the ancient demonspirit corpse head-on with his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at greater mastery. When the Flower Burial Sword clashed with the Black Tortoise Totem, sparks flew around, and they fell into a stalemate.

Lin Yun turned around, and yelled, “Old man, don’t trick me!”

“Don’t worry about it. When have I tricked you? I’m a reliable person, so you should concentrate on your fight.” Gu Jun said without raising his head. He was confident in himself, but those words felt unreliable when An Liuyan and Mei Zihua heard them.
