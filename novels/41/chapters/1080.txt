Chapter 1081 - The One Who Buries Flower (1)

“NO!” The Imperial Feather Realm Son let out a miserable howl. He desperately wanted to grab the Flame Dragon’s Heart in Lin Yun’s hand, but it was impossible. Lin Yun simply gave him a slap that sent him flying and then reached towards his interspatial pouch.

After the Imperial Feather Realm Son fell into the Saint Spiritual Lake, the entire lake started to boil violently from his flame intent. Just a moment ago, the Imperial Feather Realm Son was still suppressing Lin Yun and the latter’s holy spirits. But now the Imperial Feather Realm Son was suffering an outcome worse than death.

It was quite a shocking battle as Lin Yun vented all of his anger. He made the Imperial Feather Realm Son pay for digging out his Azure Dragon True Bone with interest.

Meanwhile, the five Realms Sons were completely dumbfounded as they looked at the Imperial Feather Realm Son who was in the lake. They had no idea what to do anymore. After all, the Imperial Feather Realm Son was defeated even after bringing out the Flame Dragon’s Heart.

“I actually suffered such a terrible loss…” The Imperial Feather Realm Son floated on the surface of the lake. He wasn’t dead, but he could feel his vitality slipping away. He couldn’t accept this outcome because he had been preparing for so long. In fact, he kept many trump cards hidden just for the final battle to become the champion.

He wanted to leave behind a legacy in the Heavenly Path that would make him famous in Kunlun Realm. However, everything went down the drain when Lin Yun destroyed him. It was a shame because he never really treated Lin Yun as an actual opponent.

The outcome of the fight instantly left everyone speechless as they looked at Lin Yun with fear.

“Is the Imperial Feather Realm Son dead?” The elders from the sects were also surprised by Lin Yun’s strength, not to mention Lin Yun’s temper. They didn’t think that Lin Yun would go to such lengths to get revenge.

No matter what the crowd thought, this was Lin Yun’s path as a swordsman. He resolved all of his grudges in this straightforward manner. Plus, he couldn’t take the fact that he was bullied and had his Azure Dragon True Bone stolen.

The demonic aura still raged like wild flames around Lin Yun as his hair fluttered violently. He was currently holding onto the Flame Dragon’s Heart with a devilish smile on his face. At this moment, he looked like a demon lord.

Sensing the demonic thoughts trying to corrode his consciousness, Lin Yun now knew why the move he just used was a forbidden move in the Azure Firmament Thirteen Sword. If he continued to be consumed and affected by the demonic thoughts, he would eventually lose himself.

But Lin Yun managed to maintain a wisp of his rationale. So he circulated his sky sword intent at complete mastery to expel the demonic thoughts. His heart was firm and his sword intent was strong. The process wasn’t easy, but Lin Yun tried to expel the wisps of demonic aura from his body.

At this moment, Lin Yun’s face was distorted. He let out a ferocious roar throughout the process.

“Hmmm?” The Realm Sons looked at this scene with surprise.

“He’s currently expelling his demonic thoughts. It looks like he used a forbidden move…”

“We should make our move right now. We just have to join hands together to injure him. We have to injure him badly or else he won’t let us off for ganging up on him.”

“That’s right. This is a great opportunity. Furthermore, we might be able to steal the Flame Dragon’s Heart and Azure Dragon True Bone.”

As the remaining Realm Sons discussed among themselves, their eyes flashed with killing intent and greed. Making up their minds, they quickly soared into the sky and unleashed their holy spirit martial techniques together. Soon, a boundless aura was suppressing Lin Yun.

In just one breath’s time, the holy spirits arrived in front of Lin Yun. The spectators didn’t even get a chance to recover from the shock of the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s loss before the other Realm Sons attacked Lin Yun.

It was a repeat to when the Realm Sons heavily injured Lin Yun. Now that Lin Yun was busy expelling his demonic thoughts, the Realm Sons were resorting to shameless tactics

“How shameless!” Luo Chen’s group began to curse when they saw this scene because the five realm sons were too shameless to gang up on Lin Yun time and time again. It was so hypocritical because they had a gentlemen’s agreement with the Imperial Feather Realm Son, but refused to do the same with Lin Yun.

But right at this moment, the demonic light disappeared in Lin Yun’s eyes as his sky sword intent exploded on the surface of his body. Then, the Azure Dragon Sword Aura comparable to a holy spirit appeared, which slowed the attacks of the five holy spirits.

The Realm Sons couldn’t believe what was happening. After all, Lin Yun seemed like he was struggling just a moment ago.

“Since I dare to expel the demonic thoughts with you guys around, I naturally have the confidence to deal with you. It looks like you five really dared to attack me once more!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly.

“So what if you’re able to recover? Since we could suppress you back then, we can naturally suppress you now!” Royal Wind Realm Son’s eyes surged with a killing aura that made his holy spirit even stronger. He knew that there was no turning back now, so he went all in on his attack.

Not even the Imperial Feather Realm Son dared to take the combined attack of their holy spirits head-on. So an exhausted Lin Yun had low odds of winning.

“Well done!” Lin Yun spread his arms apart as an Iris Flower bloomed beneath his feet. At the same time, swords flew out of his body that instantly constructed a massive sword array.

Iris Sword Array—Unrivaled!

When the sword array began to circulate, 18 purple-golden dragon runes manifested into dragons and fused into the sword array.

When the sword rays and dragons began to circulate in the sword array, there was nothing the five holy spirits could do.

The five holy spirits were instantly crushed by the sword array. At this moment, Lin Yun looked like an immortal as crystallized Iris Flowers hovered around him.

“H-h-how is this possible?!” The Royal Wind Realm Son was completely dumbfounded. They couldn’t believe that the attacks of five holy spirits were destroyed by such an insignificant sword array.

But before they could do anything, beautiful music started to play in the air. About 360 sword rays and 18 dragons began to circulate in the sword ray while an indigo colored ice phoenix appeared.

Primal Origin—Praise the Phoenix!

Boundless light radiated while the phoenix soared into the sky. A dazzling brilliance pierced the eyes of the five Realm Sons, which made blood flow out their eyes. This phenomenon far exceeded all the phenomena that Lin Yun had created in the past and allowed Lin Yun’s aura to break right into the Empyrean Realm.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“My eyes!” The five Realm Sons panicked when they lost their vision, so they began to flee for their lives.

However, Lin Yun wasn’t going to let them go. Swiping the air in front of him, Lin Yun destroyed the dao armor of all five Realm Sons. His sword intent drilled into their bodies, making them howl miserably.
