Chapter 848 - Everyone Beneath the Champion were Ants!

Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian must’ve forgotten how many people died by his sword. Lin Yun never provoked others on purpose, but he would repay those that offended him.

Lin Yun was a decisive person. Otherwise, there was no way he could comprehend the Seven Slaughtering Fist. So his eyes were already blazing with killing intent when he gave his reply.

What Lin Yun said had totally disregarded Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji and was more domineering than they thought he would act. Will he really give up his status as champion if he can’t beat them?

“Did I hear it correctly?”

“Oh my god. Lin Yun isn’t insane, right…?”

“He wants to defeat the two of them within two moves?”

“He’s gone mad.” Lin Yun’s words were too unbelievable to the crowd. Even the chief judge was dumbfounded by Lin Yun’s bold words.

Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji were briefly stunned before they started laughing.

“Do you really think that you’re hot shit? I’m enough to defeat you!” Zhao Wuji snorted as his killing aura surged on the surface of his body. A terrifying lightning began to crackle before the sky turned dark.

Yu Haotian’s eyes flickered, but he ultimately stood back. It would be best for Zhao Wuji to lose. That way, he could step on Lin Yun and Zhao Wuji.

Bolts of lightning streaked across the dark horizon as Zhao Wuji’s body crackled with lightning. Immense pressure was released from his body, catching many people off guard. The top 100 were sent flying with blood dripping from their lips.

“Retreat!” Everyone’s faces changed as they began to retreat.

“Second grade lightning intent!” Zhao Wuji’s lightning intent was now comparable to the spiritual sword intent after it reached an unbelievable height.

“No wonder he dares to be so arrogant. It looks like his lightning intent made a breakthrough in the treasury.”

“I heard that he even obtained a fortune martial technique. I bet he also made improvements in his cloud intent.”

“There’s no way Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent can suppress him anymore…” Many geniuses looked at this scene solemnly. Everyone knew that Lin Yun became the champion by relying on his spiritual sword intent to suppress Zhao Wuji’s martial intent. After all, Lin Yun’s foundation was weaker than the three kings.

“Hmph! Lin Yun, I’ll show you that you’re a piece of trash. You’re nothing without your spiritual sword intent!” Unleashing his thundercloud intent and raising it to the limit, Zhao Wuji’s face became sinister.

Zhao Wuji might keep a low-profile, but he was a petty person who couldn’t accept defeat. At this moment, his true nature was revealed. With a roar, bolts of lightning soared into the sky and spread out on the clouds.

“Looks like I won’t have a chance to attack.” Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed with pity but he still wore a playful smile. It was interesting to imagine Lin Yun being stepped on by Zhao Wuji alone.

The Violet Thunder Sect was excited by the strength that Zhao Wuji was displaying. Zhao Wuji was about to dethrone the champion and seize an unimaginable fortune.

In the blink of an eye, Zhao Wuji reached Lin Yun with lightning exploding from his body. At the same time, a ferocious lightning dragon descended and coiled around Zhao Wuji. This phenomenon alone had left many people shocked.

“Get down!” Zhao Wuji clenched his fist and threw a punch at Lin Yun. But before his punch landed, the ground beneath Lin Yun started cracking. Everyone was worried that Lin Yun was about to get crushed to death. It was even more worrisome that Lin Yun didn’t even budge.

Just when everyone was worried that Lin Yun was frozen, he stretched his arm out to block Zhao Wuji. A bizarre scene occurred as Lin Yun’s arm didn’t even budge when facing Zhao Wuji’s strongest attack.

“What’s going on?” Zhao Wuji’s face changed because he clearly wasn’t expecting this. In the next second, torrential rage surged in his eyes and his face became distorted. Throwing out dozens of punches, Zhao Wuji yelled, “Quit acting!”

As the barrage of punches descended, the thunderclouds in the sky formed a massive vortex. Every single one of Zhao Wuji’s punches could kill an ordinary Heavenly Soul Realm expert, but Lin Yun wasn’t too bothered by them. He quickly moved his arm and easily defended each attack.

A boundless sword intent manifested behind Lin Yun and withstood Zhao Wuji’s thundercloud intent completely. Although they couldn’t see, everyone could sense the massive and invisible sword intent.

“My turn,” said Lin Yun.

“Retreat!” Zhao Wuji’s eyes narrowed as fear flashed in his eyes. He quickly retreated at top speed.

But could he really retreat? Lin Yun clenched his fist and threw out a casual punch. His punch instantly pierced the air and landed on Zhao Wuji’s chest.

With a huge explosion, the origin energy around Zhao Wuji shattered while the vortex in the sky collapsed. Then, Lin Yun’s punch created a pit in Zhao Wuji’s chest.

Zhao Wuji instantly arched his body as he was sent flying. Lin Yun moved quickly and grabbed Zhao Wuji’s wrist before the latter got too far.

With a cold light flashing through his pupils, Lin Yun threw Zhao Wuji into the ground. When Zhao Wuji smashed into the ground, cracks started to spread out over 1,000 meters. The impact was so strong that a ravine had been formed.

It was a brutal scene. No one had imagined that Lin Yun would easily defeat Zhao Wuji. The deep ravine alone made the crowd sweat in fear.

How is this possible… Everyone from the Violet Thunder Sect felt dumbfounded.

“Sky Shattering Fist!” While everyone was shocked, Yu Haotian charged forward and threw his punch out. His attack was a lot stronger than when he faced Lin Yun before.

Yu Haotian was emitting purple radiance from his entire body. This was a sign that his overlord aura was practically perfect. It even dyed the entire sky purple when he soared into the sky. His radiance was so bright that he looked like the moon.

Lin Yun merely looked at Yu Haotian when he saw this. Starlight began to gather in the depths of his eyes as boundless sword intent manifested an azure dragon behind him. The dragon didn’t display any of its previous phenomena. Instead, it stood still while it emitted immortal intent.

Lin Yun didn’t make a single move. He merely glanced at Yu Haotian’s phenomenon, causing it to be riddled with holes. Under his immortal sword intent, Yu Haotian’s domineering aura began to collapse. Yu Haotian threw up blood and collapsed in front of Lin Yun.

But just as he was about to stand up, Lin Yun’s words echoed in his ears, “Kneel!”

Yu Haotian instantly complied with Lin Yun’s command while the Indigomoon Elysium became unhappy. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“You gave Yue Weiwei one punch, so I’ll give you one punch.” Lin Yun stomped his foot on the ground, causing Yu Haotian to fly into the sky. But before Yu Haotian could respond, a hole appeared on his chest as he was sent flying 1,000 meters away. Lin Yun was so quick that no one had a chance to respond.

Lin Yun held his hands behind his back, glancing at the Indigomoon Elysium and Violet Thunder Sect. At this moment, he emitted a boundless aura that made the disciples of the two sects tremble in fear.

The entire place was silent, but everyone had the same thought. Everyone below the champion was an ant.
