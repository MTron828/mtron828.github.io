Chapter 1491 - Ten Thousand Years Flower! (2)

Lan Siyu was in a good mood. He knew the Heavenly Astral Pavilion well, and the information of the thirteen envoys was within his grasp. Since An Liuyan was the only female amongst the thirteen envoys, they had long paid attention to her, and this coincidental meeting placed him in a good mood. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

But his excellent mood disappeared when he saw Lin Yun standing beside An Liuyan.

“You’re being too courteous.” An Liuyan smiled.

When Lan Siyu saw An Liuyan’s glittering eyes and her enchanting figure, it made it even harder for Lan Siyu to contain the flames in his heart, and he smiled, “It's fate for us to meet here. Since Envoy An isn’t at the Dragon Burial Valley but here instead, I bet you have the same thoughts as me. Why don’t we travel together?”

“You’ll have to ask my friend about that.” An Liuyan smiled as she looked at Lin Yun.

Lan Siyu was surprised to hear that because this meant that An Liuyan’s relationship with that youth wasn’t simple. But that youth was only at the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, and he didn’t think that someone like him was fit for An Liuyan. So he took it as An Liuyan had rejected him.

Immediately, a burst of rage blazed in his heart, but he maintained his composure and smiled. “Envoy An, you really know how to joke.”

The grey-clothed bladesman beside him coldly looked at Lin Yun, “I would leave now, if I were you.”

The two beside Lan Siyu were guests invited by the Netherworld Hall and were both at the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. Lin Yun could naturally tell they were looking down on him and didn’t take him seriously.

“But it’s a pity that you’re not me. Let’s go.” Lin Yun said before leaving with An Liuyan.

Seeing this, Lan Siyu looked at their silhouettes with his gaze flickering; no one knew what he was thinking about. But the grey-clothed bladesman said with disdain, “Young Master Lan, why didn’t you let me get rid of him? I only need one blade to deal with someone like him!”

“There’s no rush. That person is just a piece of garbage, and he’s a shield An Liuyan took out. Even if we kill him, it's useless because An Liuyan will only find a new excuse. We still have a lot of time to play, and I want to make her follow me willingly!” Lan Siyu smiled with his eyes squinted. He looked confident because he wasn’t only a core disciple of the Netherworld Hall, but was also from an Ancient Saint Clan.

The Eastern Desolation’s Lan Clan was a colossus comparable to a holy land, and it was a piece of cake for him to deal with an envoy from the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. Ever since he was young, no one could compete with him whenever he fancied something, whether it was treasures or beauties.

Lin Yun and An Liuyan quickly moved outside the valley, and they didn’t say a word. Not only were there countless ruins in this region, there were even all kinds of terrains. Cliffs, rivers, barren lands, swamps… all kinds of landscapes could be seen, filled with various saint trees surrounded by cultivators.

A while later, An Liuyan said, “Do you regret traveling with me?”

“It’s natural to attract trouble when traveling with such a beauty. But I’m not afraid of trouble.” Lin Yun answered.

“You’re more confident in yourself than I thought.” An Liuyan said. “Lan Siyu is one of Netherworld Hall’s seven core disciples. His strength might rank last, but no one dares to underestimate him in the sect. The Lan Clan is also one of the Ancient Saint Clans in the Eastern Desolation. He’s a direct descendant of the Lan Clan, which means that he has the bloodline of an Ancient Saint Clan flowing in his body.”

“Someone from the Ancient Saint Clan can join the demonic sect?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

“Why not? We’re not in the Divine Dragon Empire. Don’t forget that this is the Eastern Desolation!” An Liuyan said. “Your vision is limited to the Ancient Barren Domain. The Ancient Barren Domain isn’t the core region of the Eastern Desolation. It only occupies 30% of the territory. The Eastern Desolation was a lot larger than the Ancient Barren Domain.”

Lin Yun was no longer troubled by that and asked, “What did he mean earlier when he said that you share the same thoughts as him by not going to the Dragon Burial Valley?”

An Liuyan then shared with Lin Yun what she learned from the Heavenly Astral Pavillion. The Dragon Remnant Astral Realm could be divided into five portions, and the Dragon Burial Valley was the most dangerous region in the astral realm. But it also contained the most opportunities, and the Divine Dragon Bone that Lin Yun was looking for might be found there.

Aside from that, it was also divided into north, south, east, and west. They’re in the east region where saint trees could be found everywhere. The south was a barren land enveloped in flames. It was a restricted region, and wasn’t somewhere someone at the Elysium Core Realm could enter.

The west was a desert with an oasis deep within it. Various exotic flowers could be found there, along with various saint elixirs.

The north was a cemetery filled with sins, resentment, and ghosts. It was a treasured place for cultivation in the eyes of many cultivators.

The strongest experts from the seven demonic sects would naturally gather at the Dragon Burial Valley to retrieve the Divine Dragon Bone and other treasures. But it was too dangerous there; it wouldn’t be safe even for someone at the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

An Liuyan had no intention of heading there and wanted to try her luck in the other regions. Lan Siyu was ranked at the bottom amongst the seven core disciples from the Netherworld Hall. So he naturally didn’t dare to head to the Dragon Burial Valley, and no one could order him to do otherwise.

So he thought An Liuyan shared the same thoughts as him when he saw her. Honestly speaking, An Liuyan didn’t head to the Dragon Burial Valley because she worried Lin Yun might lose his life. So she wanted to bring him around and gather treasures to boost his strength.

With enough opportunities, Lin Yun might have a chance to compete for the Divine Dragon Bone with the other seven demonic sects’ geniuses.

“You feel I can’t compete with the seven demonic sects’ geniuses with my current strength?” Lin Yun asked.

An Liuyan nodded her head; she wasn’t shy to admit it. Lin Yun was strong, but he was only at the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. The leaders of the demonic sects’ geniuses were at least at the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

Moreover, they also had nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts around them, and those were monsters who lived for hundreds of years. They already planned to be stuck at the Elysium Core Realm for the rest of their lives, so they could be considered invincible existences at the Elysium Core Realm.

“So, what do you think now?” An Liuyan smiled while winking her eye.

Hearing that, Lin Yun smiled and didn’t say a word. He knew that the Dragon Burial Valley was terrifying, and they wouldn’t be able to enter anytime soon. So they spent the next few days searching for saint trees and other treasures.

They found many ancient items, but the saint aura and runes were corroded from the flow of time. These ancient saint artifacts shone brightly in the last era, and just looking at them was enough to make anyone sigh, even when looking at the corroded artifacts.

But fortunately, they found many saint fruits, so Lin Yun wasn’t empty-handed. After they swept through the east region, Lin Yun and An Liuyan were prepared to try their luck at the oasis in the west region. After all, staying in the east region wouldn’t bring them any other gains.

The two came to the desert and walked on the dried riverbed. During this period, they met many guests from the other demonic sects and gathered much information regarding the Dragon Burial Valley. It didn’t go smoothly for those in the Dragon Burial Valley.

They heard that under the remaining dragon aura enveloping that region, everyone’s strength would significantly drop. Aside from that, there were also various terrifying existences like Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses. Those were ancient demonic corpses tainted in dragon blood. So even the weakest Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpse had the strength comparable to an eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. But there was also a piece of good news, those demonic corpses couldn’t leave the valley.

The two of them executed their movement technique while walking on the dried riverbed. One of their steps was equivalent to a thousand meters, even though they looked like they were strolling.

Suddenly, Lin Yun stopped because the Flower Burial Sword in his sword box trembled. He instantly understood what was happening since he shared a deep connection with the Flower Burial Sword. This meant that there might be exotic flowers here.

Closing his eyes, Lin Yun spread out his sword intent and could sense a faint fluctuation, but it was so faint that it had disappeared when he tried to find it again.

“What’s wrong?” An Liuyan asked.

“Traveling with a beauty doesn’t only bring trouble…” Lin Yun briefly paused before he smiled, “I probably found a ten thousand-year exotic flower!”
