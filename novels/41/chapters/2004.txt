Chapter 2005 - Nourishment

But with Lin Yun’s current cultivation, in addition to the Astral Sword Intent and Azure Dragon Sword Heart, he could try it. He also had Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red helping him, so it shouldn’t be a problem for him to ensure his own safety. He turned to Lil’ Purple and asked, “Are you sure the Udumbara Flower is here?”

“It’s here, but I don’t know where it is exactly. I can only sense the approximate location,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun wasn’t too bothered because he could train himself here even if he couldn’t find the Udumbara Flower. Sins formed Blood Crows, gradually forming into a tribe within the Myriad Graves Valley.

After killing the Blood Crows, their sins would be left behind. Those sins weren’t beneficial to cultivation but could be used to temper one’s martial intent. However, the effects weren’t that great, not to mention the process was dangerous. But it was better than nothing.

Many people came to the Myriad Graves Valley to train; most were here to temper their martial intent. None of them considered retrieving the Udumbara Flower because it couldn’t be found and it was dangerous. As a result, many cultivators would die within the Myriad Graves Valley every year.

After a brief pondering, Lin Yun led the party into the Myriad Graves Valley. They came to a dark region with a towering tree that covered the sky, and the surrounding air was filled with a horrifying miasma. With a glance, Lin Yun found several Blood Crows and said, “I’ll deal with the strongest one. I’ll leave the rest to you, are you fine with that?”

“Don’t worry about it. I can handle the Blood Crows,” Bai Qingyu said. She was actually afraid, but her mentality had slowly changed after experiencing so much, especially with the Indigocloth Venerable. It made her realize how nasty one could be. She could only be at the other party’s mercy if she wasn't strong enough. At that time, she wouldn’t be able to die even if he wanted to, and she didn’t want to experience that again. Furthermore, she wanted to prove that she wasn’t useless.

Lin Yun nodded and flew towards a Blood Crow on the tree branch. This was a Blood Crow who had cultivated for a thousand years, and it was thirty feet tall with a golden luster on its crimson wings. The Blood Crow was sensitive to threats, and it had detected Lin Yun before he got a hundred meters close to it.

“A swordsman?” The Blood Crow looked down at Lin Yun from the tree branch. “It has been a long time since a swordsman came here to die. Your flesh is tempting. If I devour you, I might be able to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm.”

The Blood Crow was cocky and spread its wings apart with seven to eight crimson streaks flying towards Lin Yun like spears.

Lin Yun activated his two saint physiques and threw a punch, destroying those crimson spears. The Blood Crow was stronger than Xiao Jingyan and the Indigocloth Venerable in terms of cultivation, and it was comparable to a Quasi-Saint at the first stage of the Azure Origin Phase. Then again, the Blood Crows didn’t know any martial techniques or possess saint aura.

After shattering the crimson spears, Lin Yun threw a punch forth. His punch was terrifying, containing a powerful dragon aura that was accompanied by a thunderstorm. This punch could easily kill an ordinary cultivator at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. When it fell on the Blood Crow, it made the Blood Crow let out a snort, suffering no injuries.

“Human cultivator, you better get lost now, or you’ll die when the king of my clan arrives,” the Blood Crow threatened.

“What a powerful defense…” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked, and it appeared that he could only draw his sword now. When the Blood Crow was done speaking, Lin Yun drew his sword, activating the glory spirits and bringing out his Astral Sword Intent.

The Blood Crow uttered a horrified scream and tried its best to avoid it, but it still lost to the wind. The Blood Crow was immediately terrified, and it began to beg for mercy, “Please spare me!”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before swinging another sword, taking the life of the Blood Crow. When the Blood Crow’s corpse fell to the ground, a crimson aura was emitted, which Lin Yun devoured, he could instantly sense a blazing energy on his forehead that made him tremble from the piercing pain. At the same time, terrifying illusions began to appear before his eyes before wisps of crimson radiance were released from his forehead in the form of a mist.

“It’s really effective!” Lin Yun discovered that his Astral Sword Intent had gotten stronger under the tempering of sin. The process was dangerous, and he would run amok if he wasn’t careful.

“I’m lucky that I practiced Sword Intent, which is the bane of sins. As long as I can last through it, I’ll definitely be able to benefit.” Lin Yun decided to hunt a thousand Blood Crows. This was because it wasn’t easy to make a breakthrough in Martial Intent through normal means, and most of his breakthroughs were because of luck. His current accomplishment was thanks to the Heavenly Cloud Fruits.

By the time it was night, Lin Yun already slaughtered all the Blood Crows within a radius of a thousand miles. Thirty-six died in his hands amongst the Blood Crows that reached a thousand years old, and he practically used one to two swords to resolve them.

When dawn came, Lin Yun continued deep into the Myriad Graves Valley. He ran into a Blood Crow King who had lived for over three thousand years, the overlord in the Myriad Graves Valley.

“Human swordsman, your journey has come to an end. This is the home of my clan, not your playground.” The Blood Crow King glared at Lin Yun. Just one night, Lin Yun slaughtered all the Blood Crows within a radius of a thousand miles, causing a great commotion within the Blood Crow Tribe.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

There were three Blood Crows that were reaching a thousand years beside the Blood Crow King, along with hundreds of Blood Crows at the Nirvana Stage.

“Tell me the clues of the Udumbara Flower, and I’ll leave,” Lin Yun said.

“I don’t know any Udumbara Flower!” The Blood Crow King roared. “Since I gave you a chance and you don’t want to leave, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”

The Blood Crow King’s strength was comparable to a Quasi-Saint at the second stage of the Azure Origin Phase. The difference might only be between first stage and second stage, but the difference was huge because a Quasi-Saint at the second stage of the Azure Origin Phase could easily defeat ten at the first stage.

Whenever there were rumors of someone in the top ten of the King Ranking defeating a Quasi-Saint, most of the Quasi-Saints they defeated were barely at the first stage of the Azure Origin Phase. There weren’t many who defeated those at the first stage. They could only flee for their lives if they ran into those at the second stage.

But it was a pity that the Blood Crow King didn’t grasp saint aura. The reason why it was so powerful was because it was old. So Lin Yun had a chance against the Blood Crow King.

The Blood Crows charged over, wanting to take advantage of their powerful physiques. When they spat out crimson flames, they were filled with sin and could make anyone struck by it feel worse than death.

A pair of wings appeared behind Lin Yun, and his speed increased, easily dodging the crimson flames. Several dodges later, Lin Yun suddenly drew his sword, activating the glory spirit and his Azure Sword Intent. His movements were smooth, and he didn’t go easy on the Blood Crows, taking every chance. He severed the wing of a thousand-year Blood Crow before adding another sword and severing its neck.

“Sword Demon! Sword Demon!” The two remaining thousand-year Blood Crows trembled in fear and retreated to the Blood Crow King.

Bai Qingyu was speechless when she saw this, and she muttered, “Why do I feel like the Blood Crows are really pitiful?”

When Lin Yun drew his sword, he began slaughtering Blood Crows, which made Bai Qingyu feel afraid like a little dog. Didn’t everyone say that the Blood Crows were extremely dangerous?

“Hmph. It’s just a mere swordsman. Our clan has lasted for over ten thousand years, and it’s not something someone like him can deal with. I’ll suppress this demon today!” The Blood Crow King flapped its wings and disappeared. When it reappeared, its wings sliced through the air towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun took several steps back before raising the Flower Burial Sword to block the incoming attack, causing sparks when the sword collided with the wings. But the Blood Crow King didn’t let him go so easily, dashing forth and swinging its wings like blades, forcing Lin Yun to take ten-odd steps back.

“Hmph, you’re nothing impressive after all.” The Blood Crow King became confident after seeing that its wings could handle Lin Yun’s sword head-on. The other Blood Crows cried out in excitement, and their morale rose.

“Finally, a decent opponent. I believe your sins should be optimistic.” Lin Yun looked at the Blood Crow King with fighting spirits and a hint of greed blazing within his pupils.

This made the Blood Crow King’s heart nervous, and it actually felt a hint of fear from Lin Yun as though it had become Lin Yun’s prey.
