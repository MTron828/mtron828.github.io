Chapter 2484 - Southern Knows Me

Time-space began to fluctuate violently on the stage as lightning descended that looked like the tribulation of an emperor. When everyone was uncertain, they cheered when they saw the reappearance of the vanished Lin Yun and the Empress.

The two were enveloped in lightning, making time-space ripples bloom like flowers.

“They’re back,” the Blade Emperor heaved in relief. He was anxious earlier because he roughly guessed what was going on. But there was nothing he could do to help with his strength.

The Radiant Sword Emperor, Black and White Emperors, Su Ziyao, and everyone who supported Lin Yun heaved in relief.

“Die!” But before everyone could catch their breath, the Empress reached out to an Imperial Dragon Spear that had plunged into the ground previously. As the spear had a trace of the Ancient Heavenly Dragon’s blood, it also became rusty under the corrosion of time.

But when the Empress held onto the spear, dragon runes appeared on her as the rusted spear shone again. The Ancient Heavenly Dragon’s blood stained on the spear made it even more potent as she stabbed with it, piercing through space and unleashing a time-space explosion.

Lin Yun was furious as he swiped his fingers on his sword. As the flower representing Sword Dao bloomed again, everyone could see the Yin-Yang Dao and Nirvana Dao being outshone by it. A sword intent far exceeding the ninth grade bloomed on Lin Yun, and he stabbed his sword out, forcing back the Empress’ spear.

“Do you want to fight till the end?” Lin Yun looked at the Empress, suppressing his anger. He knew better than anyone how powerful the tenth-grade sword intent was, and he had reached the level of a Sword Immortal, even if he only grasped the surface of it.

It might not be comparable to the Qilin Sword Immortal, but it wasn’t something that someone in the Quasi-Deity Realm could withstand. The Empress might be strong, but her eyesight was restricted to the Kunlun Realm, and she hadn’t gone out of this place before.

The Empress raised her head and said, “The Quasi-Deity Realm isn’t something you can imagine. You better execute the secret technique of the Iris Sword Saint!”

When the Empress charged over again, Yin-Yang Dao and Five Elements Dao bloomed behind her, causing the Imperial Dragon Spear to spin before charging Lin Yun with tremendous energy.

Lin Yun finally couldn’t restrain his anger, and a sword buzz echoed with a single thought. In the next second, nine thousand cloths flew out along with a majestic pillar, shattering the layers of heaven. Under this phenomenon, Lin Yun’s sword intent reached an unimaginable height as the mountains in this mountain range were severed in half even before he drew his sword.

Aside from Mount Tai, the other mountains were severed in half as the nine thousand cloths looked like a wall of sword aura, knocking the Imperial Dragon Spear back before it could even get a thousand meters close to him, and the Empress’ aura showed signs of collapsing.

As for Lin Yun, he was enveloped in starlight. He wasn’t a deity but looked like a deity at this moment, which was a Sword Immortal. He could sense that he had truly become one with heavenly dao, his sword intent wandering above the heaven and his soul fused with heavenly dao.

Through the other angle, he could overlook the entire Ancient Saint Domain. Not only the stage but the entire Ancient Saint Domain was under his gaze and could be controlled by him.

“You want to see the tenth-grade sword intent? I’ll show it to you! I told you that even if I grasped the surface of it, I’m more than capable of fighting a Quasi-Deity!” With a thought, all the mountains and rivers in the Ancient Saint Domain began to tremble as they turned into a sword ray flying out.

There wasn’t any technique, and avoiding it wasn’t impossible. As long as it was someone in the Ancient Saint Domain, they would be locked on by Lin Yun.

When the Empress blocked the incoming sword ray, she was knocked off the stage and shocked.

“My sword is eternal!” Lin Yun roared as the flower representing Sword Dao bloomed once more, devouring the Yin-Yang Dao and Nirvana Dao. When golden radiance representing sword dao bloomed, it radiated the entire Ancient Saint Domain.

Only Lin Yun’s sword ray existed in the world as everyone became pale in comparison, including the radiance of a Quasi-Deity. When Lin Yun swung his sword, the Empress threw out a mouthful of blood with the Yin-Yang Dao and Five Elements Dao behind her dissipating.

“How is this possible?!” The Blade Emperor was dumbfounded. Even the Flame Emperor was stumped, with disbelief filled in his eyes.

“Eternal Sword Dao?”

“Why did Sword Dao devour the Yin-Yang Dao and Nirvana Dao? How did he do it?”

“That’s an Eternal Dao!” Everyone was dumbfounded and couldn’t imagine how Lin Yun achieved it.

The Empress was also shocked. When she heard from Lin Yun that he could injure Quasi-Deities even if he hadn’t grasped the tenth-grade sword intent entirely, she didn’t take it seriously, but she had witnessed it now. Most importantly, it was beyond her comprehension how Lin Yun’s Sword Dao devoured the Yin-Yang Dao and Nirvana Dao.

“Divine Flame!” Seeing Lin Yun charging over with his sword, the Empress soared to the sky as her Quasi-Deity’s divine flame ignited in her brows. When the divine flame ignited, she finally broke free from Lin Yun’s sword aura restriction.

The Empress was forced into a dangerous position where she was forced to ignite her divine flame, and she couldn’t ignite it for long.

“Finally igniting your divine flame...” Lin Yun soared to the sky with his hands forming into seals. When he performed the first seal of the Myriad Celestial Sword, his sword intent enveloped the entire Ancient Saint Domain, fusing with it.

“Mhm?” The Empress’ face finally changed because she felt a hint of fear with her divine flame trembling. She instantly knew that Lin Yun was executing the secret technique from the Iris Sword Saint, and she dashed over, wanting to interrupt Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun executed the second seal, his saint origin, sword intent, and vitality began to exhaust as countless people appeared, looking at the sky roaring furiously or kneeling on the ground. That was Nirvana Dao, which brought back the people who once lived on this land.

With the seal formed, time-space began to overlap as those lives performed a kowtow to heaven, which sent the Empress flying away. But that wasn’t all, as sword rays soared to the sky and merged with heavenly dao, forming a vortex. In the next second, everyone could sense a hint of danger, and their faces turned pale.

“Yan Chen, let’s end this here. That’s the secret technique capable of slaying a deity!” The Blade Emperor was anxious but couldn’t interfere because no emperors could withstand the pressure.

The Black Emperor had experienced this secret technique, but it was on a new level after being used with the tenth-grade sword intent. If the Empress wasn’t forced to ignite her divine flame, she might have a slim chance of blocking it.

A massive sword descended from the vortex when the third seal was formed. It looked as though heavenly dao was a giant swinging the sword.

At the same time, seven sovereign divine runes flew out from the Iris Secret Realm and imprinted on the sword. When the Empress saw the sovereign divine runes engraved on the sword, she suddenly looked at ease as the sword fell onto her.

With a huge impact, Mount Tai shattered as Lin Yun hovered in the sky as though he was the manifestation of heavenly dao. Rocks crumbled on the stage, and the Empress’ face became pale and weakened. Even the divine flame in her brows was extinguished. This meant that her cultivation fell from the Quasi-Deity Realm to the Emperor Realm, and even her status as a mythical emperor was destroyed.

The Empress threw out a mouthful of blood with cracks appearing on her body. Her cultivation dropped again to the Great Saint Realm. When the sword ray was fully unleashed, her cultivation fell from the Great Saint Realm to the Quasi-Saint Realm.

The Empress’ face suddenly got covered with wrinkles, and her hair turned white. As the Empress sat down to recover, the Blade and Flame Emperors rushed down and looked at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze.

The Black and White Emperors and the Radiant Sword Emperor looked at Lin Yun with a concerned gaze.

“Are you alright?” The Radiant Sword Emperor asked. After all, Lin Yun must’ve exhausted his vitality and saint origin by executing the Myriad Celestial Sword.

Lin Yun smiled, “I’m fine. After my sword intent reaches the tenth grade, there’s no difficulty executing this secret technique.”

Lin Yun looked at the Empress, holding back his attack because he only attacked once with the sword. If he had attacked twice, the Empress would be dead.

“You won.” The Empress opened his eyes with wrinkles on her face, with her hair turned white. But there weren’t any changes in her temperament.

“Thanks,” Lin Yun replied.

The Empress said, “I now believe you can resolve the God Burial Mountain Range. Good luck.”

The Empress didn’t look disappointed but looked relieved instead. She continued, “From today onwards, the Divine Dragon Empire will help you, and I will give my position in the Profound Imperial Palace to Su Ziyao. You will give her the Heavenly Fate Talisman, right?”

“That depends on her choice. She’s my wife, and I will respect her no matter her choice,” Lin Yun replied.

The Empress nodded and left. All the surrounding cultivators were baffled and disappointed as they hadn’t recovered from the Myriad Celestial Sword. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Wait. Can you give me Tian Xuanzi’s painting?” Lin Yun called out to the Empress.

The Empress was stunned before she threw out a painting and two seals.

“Southern, Knows.” Lin Yun muttered the words engraved on the seals and continued, “Southern knows me?”

“Stamp it yourself. Perhaps he will return one day,” the Empress said. She felt relieved at this moment and would follow her oath to guard the Southern Emperor’s tomb alone.
