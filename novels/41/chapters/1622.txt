Chapter 1623 - I'm Here To Kill! (2)

When Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi, kneeling on the ground, heard that familiar voice, they both raised their heads.

“J-Junior Brother Lin…” Their eyes shone when they saw Lin Yun, but they soon helplessly urged, “Junior Brother Lin, flee quickly!”

“Lin Yun?” Those guarding the entrance of the valley’s had a change on their faces when they saw Lin Yun, and they couldn’t help retreating. At the same time, someone yelled out, “Quick! Inform the senior brothers that the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple has arrived!”

“You guys think you can run?” Lin Yun raised his head and a sun and a moon revolved within his pupils, executing the Divine Dragon Eyes.

When an even more terrifying divine dragon’s aura exploded from Lin Yun, the pressure emitted from his pupils became immense.

Two people who took a step back were killed before they could even turn their heads around. At the next moment, Lin Yun swiftly began to move through this region, raising his hand to push out a palm.

When he raised his palm, Lin Yun activated his Blue Dragon Bone, pouring all his dragon runes into his palm, looking like a divine dragon that came to life. Under that claw, anyone who came in contact with it instantly died.

Seeing this scene, Gongsun Yan took a deep breath and could feel his scalp going numb. Just what did Lin Yun obtain in the Ancient Barren Battlefield to become so powerful? This was simply too terrifying.

In the past, he knew Lin Yun had a strong physique, but he never expected Lin Yun to become so terrifying. After reaching the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, he looked like he had undergone a drastic transformation. The vitality he gave off was even more frightening than a True Dragon.

In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun returned to his original position and helped Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan to their feet, leaving behind multiple corpses on the ground with holes in their chests. It was just as he said; he was here to kill today.

The Sword Sect was his bottom line. As the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t take this lying down. After saving Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan, Lin Yun continued forth.

He learned from those two that Mu Xueqin and the others had retreated to where the Saint Constellation was located to put on a final resistance. Ye Ziling was refining the Saint Constellation, and everyone in the Sword Sect was protecting her.

“Let’s go, then.” Lin Yun continued forth without saying another word. This made Jin Xuanyi, Ji Shuxuan, and Gongsun Yan feel their hearts pumping violently. They were inwardly shocked by the power that Lin Yun displayed.

“Lin Yun!” It didn’t take the group of four to run into another juncture. The Myriad Beast Sect’s disciples were guarding this junction and were briefly stunned before they immediately recognized Lin Yun.

“Hahaha! Quick, tell Senior Brother and the others that Lin Yun is here!”

“The Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple is here!”

“Hahaha! He came at the right time! Senior Brother Yan will definitely rejoice upon hearing this news!” They were briefly stunned before they laughed, and their pupils were shining, wondering if they wanted to capture Lin Yun now. After all, there was no doubt that it would be a massive contribution if they managed to capture Lin Yun.

“Die!” But before they could make a decision, Lin Yun’s vitality surged, and a crack appeared on the ground beneath his foot. When he charged forth, he pushed the Divine Sunchasing Art to the limit, leaving behind so many faint ripples in the surroundings that others couldn’t see him clearly, even his afterimages.

His black hair fluttered violently, making him look like a death god crawling out from hell. Activating the Blue Dragon Bone, a draconic roar echoed within his body, which summoned a violent storm as his dragon aura merged with his sword ray.

The disciples guarding the junction exclaimed and quickly retrieved their saint artifacts before charging at Lin Yun. As sparks flew, none of the saint artifacts managed to harm Lin Yun. On the contrary, nicks appeared on their saint artifacts when they landed on Lin Yun.

“His body is even tougher than saint artifacts?!”

“How is this possible?! This fellow is simply a monster! Wait, what are those purple-golden runes?” Everyone widened their eyes in disbelief when they looked at Lin Yun.

“Die!” Lin Yun roared and dashed over, starting a massacre without anyone capable of even withstanding an attack from him. He had pushed the Azure Dragon Saint Art and Blue Dragon Bone to the limit, along with the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, making his pupils turn black. With a powerful physique, in addition to his nether energy at the pinnacle sixth stage, no ordinary genius could withstand an attack from him.

“Death to anyone who dares to stand in my way!” Lin Yun proceeded forth, killing anyone who dared to stand in his way. After he started a massacre, he no longer had any sympathy in his heart, displaying a terrifying efficiency in killing.

“Lin Yun is here!”

“Be careful! Lin Yun is here!” Half an hour later, the news of Lin Yun’s appearance spread with countless figures soaring to the sky.

When they saw Lin Yun, they could see the blood that looked like a long river extending from behind Lin Yun that stood out in the white snow. Looking at Lin Yun again, everyone had fear and shock in their pupils because all the disciples responsible for guarding the junctions were dead, without one spared.

“Lin Yun, you’re courting death!”

“How dare you!”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Kill him!” Countless figures flew out from the mountain range that were at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. There was no exception that they were geniuses of the Golden Generation, and there were a lot of them.

This scene made Jin Xuanyi, Ji Shuxuan, and Gongsun Yan’s faces paled because the number of enemies was too much. With a rough estimation, there were at least thirty-odd people at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm!

“I already said. Death to anyone who dares to stand in my way!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly without showing any signs of cowering.

Just as Jin Xuanyi, Ji Shuxuan, and Gongsun Yan were dumbfounded, Lin Yun soared to the sky with the azure dragon merging with his sword aura. In the next second, a boundless killing intent exploded from him like a violent hurricane.
