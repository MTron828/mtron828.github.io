Chapter 2477 - Blade and Sword

Kunlun Realm has nine ancient domains: the Ancient Heaven Domain, Ancient Earth Domain, Ancient Profound Domain, Ancient Barren Domain, Ancient Lightning Domain, Ancient Fire Domain, Ancient Ice Domain, Ancient Wind Domain, and the Ancient Saint Domain. The Ancient Saint Domain was the core of all the other domains.

The Ancient Saint Domain was filled with spiritual energy, and the other eight ancient domains couldn’t compare to it. The Ancient Saint Domain was the core of the Divine Dragon Empire.

But in terms of anywhere with the longest history, it would be the Kunlun Divine Mountain. The Kunlun Divine Mountain was a massive mountain range, and various avian demonic beasts could be seen. Out of all the mountain ranges, Mount Tai was the core.

Mount Tai’s peak was the Heavenly Path in ancient times, connected to three thousand realms with the legendary world tree growing. There was a Mount Tai Stage, where the Divine Dragon Empire held its ceremony to announce the orthodoxy.

Today, this place is filled with people. The experts from various clans and sects were gathered here. Hundreds of Emperors received a seat meant for noble guests, a mat enveloped in radiance.

Some weren’t willing to come, and they looked unhappy. This was because they could do nothing to the Empress’s invitation. After all, the Empress could easily kill them after reaching the realm of the Deity. Thus, more than half of the Emperors in the Kunlun Realm came, including the Ice Emperor.

The preparation for the ceremony was done. The Empress sat on her throne, the Blade and Flame Emperors by the side and the six dragon kings behind them. Further back would be the various clans from the Divine Dragon Empire.

An altar at the center was a treasure mountain piled up to a thousand feet with erected dragon monuments around it. The official responsible for the ceremony lit the incense and cupped his hands at the Empress, “Your Majesty, it is time.”

“Wait,” the Empress didn’t even open her eyes and waved her hand. This caused an uproar among the crowd, and many people, including the Emperors, began to discuss among themselves.

“She’s waiting for Flower Burial, right?”

“Who else? In the world, only Flower Burial can make the Empress wait.”

“Is this Flower Burial that powerful?”

“Of course. All the swordsmen witnessed how the Black and White Emperors took him as their lord. Do you know what that means?” Most of the cultivators present hadn’t seen Lin Yun before, but they had heard of him. That was especially true after the Black and White Emperors took him as their lord.

“Ice Emperor, you fought with Flower Burial before. Did you two fight to an even match?” An Emperor who was acquainted with the Ice Emperor asked. He was the Emperor Realm elder of the Hidden Sword Manor, the Abyssal Emperor.

“I lost. You don’t have to give me a face because the representatives of your Hidden Sword Manor present in the Skysolute City already saw it,” the Ice Emperor smiled.

“This is why I’m shocked. Not only did he defeat the top ten sword saints in the world, but he even climbed the Heavenly Divine Mountain. He even defeated you and had two mythical emperors take him as their lord...” the Abyssal Emperor sighed.

“It’s real. His strength is only stronger than the rumors,” the Ice Emperor said. Others didn’t know, but the Ice Emperor knew Lin Yun had gathered the seven sovereign divine runes, and Lin Yun didn’t use them in their battle. Not to mention he grasped two Eternal Daos, the Nirvana and Yin-Yang Daos, which he didn’t use. They might be sparring, but Lin Yun didn’t use many of his trump cards.

“Ice Emperor, will he come?”

“What do you think of the Black and White Emperors taking him as their lord?”

“This is insane. We all know how powerful the mythical emperors were.” The other Emperors came over, seeing the Ice and Abyssal Emperors chatting. Out of everything, they were most shocked about the White and Black Emperors taking Lin Yun as their lord.

The Ice Emperor glanced at the Empress and said, “That’s true. When the Blade Emperor was rude to Flower Burial, the White Emperor stood out, wanting to teach him a lesson.”

All the emperors fell silent upon hearing that. Shouldn't they do something about it since the Black and White Emperors took Lin Yun as their lord? At the very least, they could ignore the Empress’ order in the future, which was planting a seed in their hearts.

“That means the Flower Burial wants to reforge Heavenly Path, and this ceremony isn’t necessary to drain the nine ancient domains of their dragon vein,” the Abyssal Emperor said. The moment he said that he couldn’t help feeling a little afraid, raising his head to look at the Empress.

The Empress still had her eyes closed and did nothing. This made the Abyssal Emperor curious about what the Empress was thinking about. She must’ve heard what they said, but she didn’t respond. On the contrary, the Blade Emperor’s face had already become grim.

“How dare these people disrespect the Empress!” The Blade Emperor’s face was cold as he heard what everyone said.

“This is an obvious plot. The Black and White Emperors took Lin Yun as their lord, which was the same as giving them another choice,” the Flame Emperor said.

“They’re here.” The Empress opened her eyes with an ancient seal flashing in the depth of her pupils.

Four figures descended on the altar: Lin Yun, Radiant Sword Emperor, and the two mythical emperors.

“I am Lin Yun, and I greet everyone here!” Lin Yun cupped his fists together at the Empress before turning to everyone around, showing a humble side to him.

When everyone was curious, the Ice Emperor stood up and cupped his fists, “I greet Flower Burial.”

This stunned everyone briefly before they cupped their fists in response, even among the Emperors.

The Blade Emperor initially wanted to flare up, but he didn’t dare to do anything after seeing so many people responding to Lin Yun’s greeting.

The Empress said, “Flower Burial, I have been waiting for you.”

Facing so many Emperors, even Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling nervous. On the contrary, the Empress was calm and composed.

Lin Yun took a deep breath to calm himself down, and he couldn’t see Su Ziyao anywhere when he looked around.

“Su Ziyao is in Mount Tai, and you can see her by raising your head,” the Empress said, knowing what Lin Yun was thinking.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see Su Ziyao on the waist of Mount Tai, where there was a city wall. Beside her were Li Wuyou, Drifting Goblet, Mei Zihua, and Bai Lixuan, all looking at Lin Yun.

“Your old friends are also there. I won’t harm them, and I won’t use them to threaten you,” the Empress said.

“I believe you,” Lin Yun nodded. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hearing that, the Blade Emperor said, “Lin Yun, you have to show your respect to the Empress. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite with you.”

“It’s fine,” the Empress waved her hand.

This made the Blade Emperor feel depressed. When he raised his head, he saw the White Emperor smiling at him, making his face grimmer.

The Empress said, “I roughly know your thoughts, but I still have to ask you. Do you want to fight me, or are you here to watch the ceremony?”

Hearing that, all the present cultivators and emperors looked at Lin Yun.

“Fight!” Lin Yun said without any hesitation, and this caused an uproar in the surroundings.

Hearing Lin Yun’s response brought a smile to the Empress’ face, shocking everyone. After all, they don’t recall the Empress ever smiling before; even the Black and White Emperors were shocked because they had never seen the Empress smiling before the Southern Emperor's death. This was the first time she smiled in the past three thousand years.

The Blade Emperor felt complicated. The world might not know why the Empress smiled, but he knew. The Empress must’ve seen the Southern Emperor’s shadows on Lin Yun. This made the Blade Emperor feel complicated, and he roared, “Flower Burial, you have to get through me if you want to fight!”

The Flame Emperor’s face changed, and he was quickly persuaded. The six dragon kings, especially the Golden Dragon King, were surprised because the Blade Emperor had snatched his words.

The Blade Emperor looked at Lin Yun. This time, no one could stop him, not even the Empress, and he wanted to do something for himself.

“Why don’t I fight you instead?” The Radiant Sword Emperor stood out. “I heard of your name three thousand years ago and have become an Emperor. I want to see if your blade is as sharp as three thousand years ago.”

One was a mythical emperor from the older generation, and one was the new generation Sword Emperor.

When the Blade Emperor’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun, he could sense a powerful sword intent coming from him, similar to Yu Qingfeng. The Blade Emperor said, “So, he has left the title of Sword Emperor to you. Today, I will sever the inheritance of this title!”
