Chapter 851 - Primordial Era

Two months wasn’t a short period of time, but it wasn’t long either. Generally speaking, two months would quickly pass if a cultivator was in seclusion. After Lin Yun joined Pavilion Master Plum and the others, he shared what he heard from the Sacred Alliance.

Everyone was shocked because this was the first time they heard about it. In the past, no one had any idea that the era they belonged to was called the Divine Dragon Era. There were many eras that came before this and each era had a core realm of its own. The core realm of the Divine Dragon Era was named Kunlun.

Pavilion Master Plum and the rest were shocked. As Pavilion Master Plum chatted with Lin Yun, he guessed that there was a high possibility that Lord Thirteen and the previous pavilion master went to the Kunlun Realm.

However, the rest of the Great Qin Empire’s party was more concerned about the Heavenly Path and the competition two months from now. As for the other realms outside the Profound Amber Realm, everyone basically knew about them.

The Profound Amber Realm had a total of five domains and the Ancient Southern Domain once stood at the top of the Profound Amber Realm. But with the annihilation of Sword Sect, the fortune in the Ancient Southern Domain fell until it nearly became a forgotten domain by the other four domains.

When it came to this matter, the elders warned Lin Yun to be cautious and not to act carelessly. However, Lin Yun was calm and didn’t fret. Then, the Great Qin Empire’s group rested before they left. This time, Lin Yun didn’t leave with them because he was pressed for time. He desperately needed to make a trip to Flamedragon Hill to see Lil’ Red’s current state. If he went to the Great Qin Empire first, he would waste about one-third of his remaining time.

Pavilion Master Plum and the rest understood Lin Yun’s predicament. After all, Lin Yun had given up his guarantee to the Heavenly Path for Sacred Alliance to look after the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

“I’m afraid we won’t meet again after today. Take care of yourself and don’t be too worried about the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Since ancient times, sects with great fortune have survived all sorts of tribulation,” said Pavilion Master Plum as he comforted Lin Yun.

This farewell made Lin Yun sad because the Sword Firmament Pavilion was important to him and he had many fond memories of it. Cupping his hands together, Lin Yun bowed, “Thank you for taking care of me. Without you guys, there would be no Lin Yun today.”

Eight days later, Lin Yun appeared at the Flamedragon Hill. When Lin Yun reached the top of the mountain, he saw an endless mountain range. Unlike before, he now stood at the top of the Ancient Southern Domain’s younger generation.

However, Lin Yun still felt tiny at Flamedragon Hill even though the beasts that he was once fearful of no longer threatened him. With his current strength, he could easily kill the terrifying beasts of the past.

As a breeze blew past, Lin Yun keenly sensed a powerful ferocious aura. He was familiar with this aura because it belonged to the overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast, the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

“It seems like it got stronger…” Lin Yun followed the aura and sensed that the Indigothunder Dragonvulture was a lot stronger than before. The Azure Dragon Enneaform must be compatible with demonic beasts that possess the dragon clan’s bloodline. When Lin Yun thought about this, he was curious to see how much the Indigothunder Dragonvulture progressed the body-refining technique.

“Over there!” Lin Yun began to lock onto the Indigothunder Dragonvulture when his attention was drawn to the Falling Dragon Slope. Since the Falling Dragon Slope was so far, he couldn’t clearly see the mountain.

However, he could clearly sense the sword intent left behind by Ancestor Jian Wuming. Even after so long, the immortal sword intent still shined bright.

“I have to pay the Falling Dragon Slope a visit after meeting Lil’ Purple.” Lin Yun had grasped his spiritual sword intent there. Now that he comprehended the Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Intent, he might have a chance to take another step forward. Furthermore, he was curious to figure out what was hidden in that region.

“Time to go!” Lin Yun soared into the sky like a dragon. Every single step he took left fluctuations beneath his feet. He was using the Cloudsoaring Art. After nine steps, he already traveled ten thousand meters.

An hour later, he passed through the densely packed clouds and past many insignificant peaks. Finally, he saw three blazing peaks before him. The three peaks had become a forbidden region due to their high temperature. It was also where Lin Yun obtained the Flamedragon Fruit. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

When he landed on the ground, a colossal figure descended from the sky before he could catch his breath. This colossal figure was naturally the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

When it descended in front of Lin Yun, its colossal wings created a powerful gale. Lin Yun looked at the Indigothunder Dragonvulture in surprise because it was a lot stronger than he had imagined. He asked, “Lil’ Purple, how far have you reached in the Azure Dragon Enneaform?”

“The Hexaform. In the terms of you humans, my cultivation should be in the third soul of the Heavenly Soul Realm,” replied the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

That strong? Lin Yun knew that the Heavenly Soul Realm had a total of seven souls in correspondence to the seven orifices of the Xiantian Realm. Every single breakthrough would bring a drastic transformation in one’s strength, but there was also high risk with each breakthrough. After all, if one’s foundation was too deep, the Heavenly Soul Tribulation that one would attract would be devastating.

If Yu Haotian had made a breakthrough, then the outcome of the banquet might have been different. A Heavenly Soul Realm expert that hadn’t gone through the tribulation was like a cocoon instead of a butterfly.

Lin Yun didn’t think too much about the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s strength and shared his experience at the banquet. When the Indigothunder Dragonvulture heard about what happened, it spoke, “No wonder the aura coming from you makes me feel uncomfortable. So you have some dragon aura in your body. I wouldn’t recommend making a breakthrough with the dragon aura though.”

“Since it’s a competition between the realms, you need more accumulation in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm if you want to stand out. Otherwise, it will be hard for you to compete with the other geniuses. According to my knowledge, the Profound Amber Realm is considered common compared to other realms. Some powerful realms can even head to the bigger world directly.”

Those powerful realms can reach the Kunlun Realm directly? Lin Yun was shocked because he hadn’t heard about that from the Sacred Alliance. It appears that the Sacred Alliance still hid some information about the Heavenly Path, perhaps they didn’t want to affect their confidence.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture must have known this from its inheritance memories.

“How much do you know about the Divine Dragon Era and the Kunlun Realm?” Lin Yun asked, but he didn’t have much hope in gaining information. However, he knew it wouldn’t hurt to ask.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture pondered for a long time before it replied, “It’s too long and I only have bits and pieces about it in my inheritance memories. The old era came to an end with the birth of the new era. The old era was called the Primordial Era.”

“In the Primordial Era, countless powerhouses fell with the destruction of countless realms. Only the realm named Kunlun would exist for eternity like a seed. It absorbed other realm fragments to strengthen itself. With that, the Divine Dragon Era was born. At its beginning, it was a barbaric time with no rules. However, many ancient and mysterious existences woke up and became the new kings.”

Lin Yun’s heart throbbed violently. He didn’t really expect the Indigothunder Dragonvulture to know much about this. Perhaps this information was something that not even the Sacred Alliance knew about.

“Who ended the previous era?” asked Lin Yun.

“It’s too long ago. I only have bits and pieces in my memories, but I’m sure that this one person. He’s a white-clothed man who tore the sky with his blade, suppressing the myriad races. My ancestors seem to call him…Ancestor God. No wait…let me think again…oh, right…Azure Dragon Ancestor God!”

When the Indigothunder Dragonvulture mentioned the Azure Dragon Ancestor God, it began to wail out painfully as the blood in its body became unstable with signs of running amok. So Lin Yun quickly stopped talking about it.

It took a long time for the Indigothunder Dragonvulture to calm down and its aura was clearly weakened.

“Sorry, those memories are too old and this is all I can remember,” said the Indigothunder Dragonvulture in a hoarse voice. It was a terrifying thing to recall something from so long ago, but Lin Yun had saved its life so it wasn’t bothered by it.

Lin Yun was genuinely shocked when he heard the name ‘Azure Dragon Ancestor God’ as he wondered if that person was still alive. However, he didn’t bother asking.

“Has Lil’ Red awakened?” asked Lin Yun.

“It has, but… I’m sorry…” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture spoke hesitantly.

“It’s awake? Where is it?” Lin Yun rejoiced and didn’t notice the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s hesitation.
