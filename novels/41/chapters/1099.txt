Chapter 1100 - Practising Sword Technique With Seven Steps (1)

The grace Lin Yun displayed shocked everyone, including Ye Ziling. All of the core disciples who were unhappy with Lin Yun were speechless. They began to wonder if Lin Yun was still human. After all, he had 24 Demonic Astral Flowers when he was only in the sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm!

Ye Ziling scrunched her brows together with confusion because Lin Yun’s talent was a little too terrifying. Lin Yun basically had two times the Demonic Astral Flowers that Feng Zhang had!

Now, Feng Zhang started to look like a clown. It was especially apparent as Lin Yun’s secret technique gathered an unimaginable amount of sword intent. There was no doubt in Ye Ziling’s mind that Lin Yun’s secret technique would be unstoppable in the Empyrean Realm.

As these thoughts began to flash in Ye Ziling’s mind, deep fear flashed in her eyes. As for Feng Zhang, his face had turned pale. He was enveloped in deep fear from Lin Yun’s 24 Demonic Astral Flowers and his secret attack.

He knew that he wouldn’t be able to withstand this attack unless he brought out his cultivation in the Empyrean Realm. Without any hesitation, he tried to retreat, but he was being restricted in place. There was no way he could avoid this attack.

When the radiance accumulating in Lin Yun’s fingers reached its limit, he flicked his finger. Instantly, a brilliance that made the world lose its luster began to resonate with a sword hum.

The entire Flying Cloud Palace began to tremble violently while Feng Zhang knelt on the ground. His clothes were tattered, his hair was scattered, and his body was covered in wounds.

The crowd watched in horror as Feng Zhang faced the attack. After all, Feng Zhang wasn’t able to injure Lin Yun even with ten moves. So it was baffling that a core disciple would be pushed to such desperate straits.

Lin Yun was impressed that Feng Zhang was capable of withstanding the attack while keeping his cultivation in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

“It seems like 24 Demonic Astral Flowers isn’t that impressive,” said Feng Zhang with disdain.

“Why don’t you stand up then? Why are you kneeling?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph!” Feng Zhang snorted and tried to stand up, but he threw up blood instead. A few seconds later, he threw up even more blood. However, he was starting to stand, which confused the crowd. It was clear by now that Feng Zhang had lost the qualification to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain, so they didn’t understand why he was struggling.

“It’s been ten moves. You lost,” said Lin Yun coldly.

“Did you force me to bring out my full cultivation? I don’t think so! I’m done yet!” Feng Zhang wore a sinister expression and unleashed immense pressure from his body. In the next second, he let out a roar and a ferocious demonic vulture appeared behind him.

A commotion broke out once Feng Zhang resorted to using his holy spirit martial technique. After all, only empyreans could cultivate holy spirit martial techniques, which made them invincible against the Heavenly Soul Realm.

“Unless Lin Yun also uses a holy spirit martial technique, there is no way he can withstand this attack. But he’s only in the Heavenly Soul Realm, so it’s hopeless!”

“Senior Brother Feng, you’re going against your words!” Wang Yuruo yelled.

“Haha!” Feng Zhang laughed. “I’m not going against my words. Didn’t someone say back then that it didn’t matter?”

The crowd stopped speaking once they heard that. Feng Zhang was correct, Lin Yun did say that. Then again, it was still shameless for him to use a holy spirit martial technique against someone in the Heavenly Soul Realm. At this moment, Feng Zhang had completely thrown away all face for the quota to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain.

When Wang Yuruo heard that, she had no way to respond. She couldn’t refute Feng Zhang’s words, which made her mad.

“Lin Yun, you can still admit defeat. Otherwise, who knows what will happen after I use my holy spirit martial technique.” Relying on the terrifying pressure from the demonic vulture behind him, Feng Zhang’s already shattered sword aura gathered again.

“Junior Brother Yun, don’t listen to him. He’s just being shameless!” Wang Yuruo yelled out anxiously.

However, Lin Yun winked at her and then turned to Feng Zhang with a smile, “Naturally, I said you could use a holy spirit martial technique. But if I remember correctly, you said you would admit defeat if I could endure ten of your attacks?”

“So what? You’re the one who said that I can use my holy spirit martial technique, and I didn’t use it in my previous ten moves!” Feng Zhang said calmly as he was already determined to carry out this fight to the very end.

“Senior Brother Feng is right. Lin Yun did say that, and we can all attest to it.” The core disciples who had a close relationship with Feng Zhang spoke out.

“You still have the chance to change your mind. Otherwise, who knows if you’ll still be alive after Senior Brother Feng uses his holy spirit martial technique!” Another core disciple sneered.

The crowd was upset because they didn’t think the fight would develop like this. It seemed like the core disciples were determined to stand against Lin Yun.

Feng Zhang wore a smirk as the disciples took his side, “Lin Yun, what do you have to say?”

“You’re right. There’s nothing I can say when an empyrean decides to be shameless,” sneered Lin Yun after a brief silence.

Lin Yun’s words made Feng Zhang’s face even more sour. After all, Feng Zhang brought out his holy spirit martial technique. Enraged, Feng Zhang flew towards Lin Yun with his holy spirit, “Lin Yun, I’ll show you why empyreans can’t be humiliated!”

A terrifying black light swept out from the demonic vulture that made the sky turn dark. Feng Zhang pushed his holy spirit martial technique to the limit, which was impossible for a Heavenly Soul Realm to withstand.

“Retreat!” Many inner disciples were scared that they would be implicated by the power of the holy spirit.

“Empyreans can’t be humiliated? That’s the first time I’ve heard that!” Lin Yun smiled and a Golden Crow flew out of his body, instantly shredding the dark clouds. But Lin Yun didn’t stop there as a Silver Phoenix flew out of his body.

Divine Solar Lunar Fist—Heaven and Earth, Unite!

Lin Yun soared into the sky with both a sun and moon in his hands before throwing a punch. Instantly, Feng Zhang’s holy spirit was destroyed, causing him to go flying. But Lin Yun’s holy spirits didn’t stop despite Feng Zhang crashing into the ground.

At this moment, Feng Zhang unleashed his full cultivation with a roar. But even so, he still took several steps backwards to stabilize himself. As for Lin Yun, he hovered in the sky with his hands behind him and two holy spirits circling him.

At this moment, everyone looked at Lin Yun in a daze. So it turned out that Lin Yun also knew a holy spirit martial technique. However, Lin Yun’s technique had two spirits. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Looking down at Feng Zhang from the sky, Lin Yun sneered, “Senior Brother Feng, didn’t you say something about an empyrean who cannot be humiliated?”

Feng Zhang’s face alternated between red and white because he knew that he had lost terribly since he brought out his cultivation in the Empyrean Realm. There was nothing he could say anymore.

As for the other core disciples, they exchanged shocked gazes. They couldn’t believe what kind of monster Lin Yun was.
