Chapter 679 - Never Drawing Sword Again Unless Revenge Is Taken!

No words could describe the shock in Lin Yun’s heart as he was completely dumbfounded. He knew that sword intent was categorized into nine grades with the xiantian sword intent merely being the first grade. Right above it was the spiritual sword intent.

As for what was above the spiritual sword intent, Lin Yun had no idea. At the far end of his sight, there was a sword floating in the sky, enveloped with lightning that emitted a strong pressuring sword intent. At the very least, Lin Yun was sure that it wasn’t the spiritual xiantian sword intent as it was too powerful.

Lin Yun was under the impression that this sword was the ruler of this region and anyone who saw it had to bow before it. If anyone showed any disrespect, they would definitely be killed. Even if the owner of this sword intent had been dead for a millennium, it still stood there elegantly.

As a swordsman, Lin Yun could feel his blood boiling. This meant that the expert who fought with the Flame Dragon a millennium ago was a swordsman. He could sense the pride coming from it and it was a pride that belonged to a swordsman.

When can I be this strong? Lin Yun clenched his right fist with anticipation in his eyes. Then, he looked up ahead with reverence, as if any action he made was blasphemous to this senior. At this moment, he was determined to make his sword intent exist for an endless age like this sword intent before him.

It took a long time for Lin Yun to calm down. When he got used to the dazzling light, he charged forward. He wanted to see who the ‘young master’ was to have such a powerful force to be planning this for thirty days.

It wasn’t easy to comprehend sword intent, which was a huge reason why Lin Yun could fight those above his cultivation. Even in the Ancient Southern Domain, he could be considered to be among the top ranks.

But he never expected that this ‘young master’ would refine the Imperial Sword Herb to have his sword intent reach his height. This made Lin Yun feel a little unhappy. After all, he had gone through life and death to bring his sword intent to this height.

Lin Yun moved through the forest with great agility and kept his aura within his body. It didn’t take long for him to get a clear look of the situation. There was a sword hovering in the mountain and many Ironblood Sword Gate’s elites were stationed beneath the mountain.

Looking at them, Lin Yun finally knew why he hadn’t encountered any experts from the Ironblood Sword Gate. So it turns out that all of them were here.

They were all surrounding a white-clothed youth, who was seated with his eyes closed. Beside him was a grey-clothed middle-aged man that emitted a deep and unfathomable aura.

Looking at the middle-aged man, Lin Yuns’ face changed because he was a Heavenly Soul Realm expert. Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling shocked that this young man had a Heavenly Soul Realm expert guarding him. This meant that the young man probably had a huge background. When he continued to look around, he noticed that there was another black-clothed old man with a cultivation in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm with the Ironblood Sword Gate’s emblem on his chest.

He instantly figured out that this man was the sect master of the Ironblood Sword Gate. This couldn’t help leaving him shocked to see the powerful formation, and he instantly understood that this white-clothed young man probably had a huge background. He heard that this young man came from the Miresword City, a city filled with sword sects. It was also one of the seven main cities in the Thunder Prefecture. But it had a greater reputation as it was a city of swordsmen, the sacred city of swordsmen.

Lin Yun had heard about it before entering the Flamedragon Hill. He heard that the sword sect this young man came from could be ranked top three in the Miresword City. Otherwise, the Ironblood Sword Sect wouldn’t send out such a formation.

“Time to leave.” Lin Yun retracted his gaze. He knew that even if that Heavenly Soul Realm expert wasn’t here, there was no way he could poke his nose in this matter with the Ironblood Sword Gate here. Furthermore, he still had something else to do.

When Lin Yun spread his arms and landed on the ground, his heart jolted. When he raised his head, he saw four figures coming towards him. When the four people saw Lin Yun, they were also shocked and surprised.

When Lin Yun took a closer look at the four, his face changed because one of them was the middle-aged man that he faced back then, and the other two were also in the lesser Yin-Yang stage. As for the old man, he was in the greater Yin-Yang stage. Before this, the only other danger that he sensed came from the white-haired old man.

“Vice-Sect Master, it’s him! He’s the one who stole my Flamedragon Fruit!” The middle-aged man yelled after recovering from his shock as killing intent began to fill his eyes. After all, Lin Yun’s punch nearly took half his life, and even now, he could still feel pain in his ribs.

Lin Yun knew that he was in trouble. He also knew that he would be in trouble if the Heavenly Soul Realm expert made his move. After all, Lin Yun knew how powerful a Heavenly Soul Realm expert was back in the Withernorth Sea. That expert had merely roared in order to destroy his xiantian sword intent in complete mastery.

“A nobody dares to intrude the Ironblood Sword Gate’s territory? You must be courting death!” The vice-sect master of the Ironblood Sword Gate, Tang Ying, had a violent temper. So he charged forward without any hesitation and swung his palm. He wanted to make Lin Yun kneel before him and beg for his life.

But Lin Yun had no shock on his face. He quickly circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and Azure Dragon Enneaform, merging his lightning runes and origin energy together. When his punch clashed with the old man’s palm, he was sent flying back with blood dripping down from the corner of his lips.

What power! Lin Yun had fear flashing in his pupils. After reaching the Yin-Yang stage, one’s origin would undergo a transformation with Yin and Yang merging together. But it wouldn’t be that obvious in the lesser Yin-Yang stage, which was why Lin Yun could suppress those in the lesser Yin-Yang stage when relying on the Iris Sword Sutra and Azure Dragon Enneaform.

But the difference between a lesser and greater Yin-Yang stage wasn’t something that could be described with words and Lin Yun had suffered greatly in the initial clash.

“Not bad. No wonder the useless elder of my Ironblood Sword Gate couldn’t take a single attack of yours,” said Tang Ying coldly. “Hand over the Flamedragon Fruit and I’ll let you live. Otherwise, don’t blame me for taking your life. You might be able to take a palm from me, but can you take ten of my palms?”

Damn it! Lin Yun was filled with grievance in his heart as this old man was too much. He wanted to bring out the Indigoflame Thunderwhip to fight this person, but he knew that the commotion would definitely draw attention to him. So he had no choice but to give up.

This old man might be strong and there was no way this old man would leave him behind. But he knew that he would die if he was entangled by these people and attracted the Heavenly Soul Realm expert’s attention.

“Hey, didn’t you hear what the vice-sect master said?” The middle-aged man said in satisfaction at Lin Yun’s state.

“The Flamedragon Fruit has been eaten by my Dragon Blooded Horse,” said Lin Yun.

But the moment he finished, he could sense a boundless killing intent focused on him as a sinister smile appeared on Tang Ying’s wrinkly face. “So sly at such a young age. You must be courting death!”

Seeing that Tang Ying was about to approach him, Lin Yun quickly called out, “Wait! I might not have the Flamedragon Fruit anymore, but I have something else that might catch your attention.”

Lin Yun quickly tapped his interspatial pouch and took out the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s egg. The egg was glittering and gorgeous, like a huge gem.

The moment he took it out, Tang Ying’s gaze was instantly glued onto it with greed filled in his eyes. But he maintained his composure and said, “Come over and place it on the ground slowly.”

Lin Yun carefully stepped forward before placing the egg on the ground. But no one noticed that the moment Lin Yun placed it on the ground, he applied some force and created a tiny crack on it.

But just when Lin Yun placed it on the ground, Tang Ying suddenly unleashed a violet aura as he stomped his foot on Lin Yun’s right hand. This instantly produced a crackling sound as Lin Yun’s bones had broken under this stomp.

This made Lin Yun’s face turn pale from the pain, but he didn’t utter a single noise as he gritted his teeth to bear the pain. After all, the hand was connected to the heart. So one could imagine the pain he was going through.

“This is not bad and it’ll make up for the Flamedragon Fruit. But you’ve injured someone from my Ironblood Sword Gate. I can spare you, but not without some punishment,” said Tang Yin coldly as he kicked on Lin Yun’s chest.

With a crackling sound coming from Lin Yun’s chest, the middle-aged man watched with a brutal smile. This kick broke Lin Yun’s ribs even with his Azure Dragon Enneaform.

But that wasn’t all as Lin Yun suffered several sword rays before he landed on the ground, leaving seven holes on his chest as blood began to flow out. Suffering such heavy injuries, Lin Yun’s face was pale and his aura was weakened.

With a suction force, the egg flew into Tang Ying's hand where he inspected it with a satisfied expression. Then, he looked at Lin Yun and barked, “Get lost!”

Getting back up on his feet, Lin Yun staggered as he tried walking away. But he soon collapsed onto the ground after taking a few steps. He took a brief rest before he got back on his feet and left the place. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Vice-Sect Master, isn’t it too easy to let him leave so easily?” The middle-aged man said with a cold light flashing in his eyes.

“Have you seen someone in the Yang stage who can take my palm without dying? This brat’s background isn’t simple. If I kill him, it’ll definitely attract the attention of his senior. It’ll make things troublesome. So I’m ensuring that he won’t ruin the young master’s matters,” said Tang Ying.

“Furthermore…” Tang Ying turned to look at the egg with joy flashing in his eyes, “The vitality in this egg is unprecedented and I might be able to reach the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage after I refine it!”

Lin Yun walked slowly in the forest, with blood dripping on the ground. Tang Ying was so vicious in humiliating him just because he had a stronger cultivation. Not only did he crush the bones in his palm and chest, he even left seven holes in his body.

Each of the holes were lethal and he would be dead if he didn’t have such a powerful physique. But even so, he was now heavily injured after losing half of the blood in his body.

Just when his consciousness was about to blur out, he could hear a familiar clattering sound coming as Lil’ Red ran over in a pitiful state. Evidently, it had suffered greatly with the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture chasing after it.

But when it saw Lin Yun on the ground, its face changed drastically especially after seeing the seven holes on Lin Yun’s chest. It used its head to rub against Lin Yun’s face as if it would make Lin Yun feel better.

“Stop acting. I won’t die,” said Lin Yun as he squeezed out a smile.

But Lil’ Red didn’t listen to him and suddenly ran off. Not long later, Lil’ Red returned just when Lin Yun was about to lose his consciousness again. This time, Lin Yun could see several more injuries on its body, especially its head. But it had a fruit in its mouth as it chuckled goofily.

Then, Lil’ Red chewed the leaves around the fruit before placing the fruit on Lin Yun’s chest and pushing it gently with its head. But Lin Yun couldn’t smile when he looked at its injuries, especially the one on its head.

Grabbing the fruit, Lin Yun couldn’t bring himself to swallow it. But looking at the anticipation in the Dragon Blooded Horse’s eyes, he had no choice but to stuff it in his mouth. When he swallowed it down, he couldn’t help tearing up.

At this moment, an unprecedented hatred flashed in his eyes as he gnashed his teeth, “Ironblood Sword Gate!”

At this moment, he swore to himself that he would never draw his sword again if he didn’t take revenge for this matter!
