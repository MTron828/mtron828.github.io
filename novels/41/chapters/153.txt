Chapter 154 - Braving through death to rescue

That sharp sword left everyone shocked. The thick sword intent emitted from him overbearingly pierced through the sky. The majestic momentum from the sword intent was like an enormous mountain, traversing through the horizon.

Lin Yun knew that Bai Lixuan was powerful, but he never witnessed Bai Lixuan making a move. This sword intent made Lin Yun feel despair and he guessed that not even the Wang Clan’s Quasi-Profound Martial Realm could take it head-on. Not to mention the young lady, who was quite heavily injured.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Several figures flickered through the air and landed firmly on a nearby hill. They were all stunned by this scene.

“Bai Lixuan has finally made a move!”

“This demoness is finally going down. She had previously toyed with Bai Lixuan and Si Xueyi.”

“If she wasn’t injured in the tomb, I’m afraid that it would have been more difficult to deal with her.”

“That sword attack was really ruthless. It seems Bai Lixuan doesn’t plan on letting her live.”

A large group of Xiantian Realm cultivators who came from the Palace Tomb looked at this scene with pity in their eyes. There weren’t many people who could force Bai Lixuan this far, so they knew that the young lady wasn’t simple.

But in the end, she was forced into a dead-end by the Sword Firmament Pavilion and it seemed like she wouldn’t be able to escape death. After all, who in the Azure Sun Realm dared to withstand this sword from Bia Lixuan?

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

But suddenly, the surrounding Xiantian Realm cultivators were shocked to discover that the swords and blades in their hands started to buzz uncontrollably. It sounded like an ethereal chime, ringing out in the world.

“What’s going on?”

“My sword!”

“Shit! Why is my sword going out of control?”

While everyone was shocked and puzzled, they saw a blue-clothed figure bolting towards Bai Lixuan with a sword box over his head. The buzzing chime came from that figure. As the young man ran, his sword aura grew more refined. His clothes and hair fluttered in the wind. There was a sign of unprecedented courage and stubbornness on his young face.

“It’s Lin Yun!”

“What is he trying to do? Is he mad?”

Everyone was dumbfounded. They had no idea what Lin Yun was trying to do. Could he be trying to receive Bai Lixuan’s sword?

Sizzle! Sizzle!

Before Lin Yun even approached, his clothes became tattered from Bai Lixuan’s sword aura and a few wounds were left on his body. There was a huge difference between them, whether it be the comprehension of sword dao or cultivation.

He only managed to sense how mighty the sword was when he approached. If it were someone else, they would’ve collapsed before they could even get close.

“It’s him…” The young lady was briefly stunned when he saw Lin Yun running over.

“Ignorant!” yelled Bai Lixuan.

Bai Lixuan’s eyes flickered coldly. In his view, Lin Yun was ignorant and his sword intent would shred Lin Yun into pieces. All of a sudden, his sword bolted over.

One with the sword! Lin Yun gnashed his teeth and leaped. His sword aura suddenly retracted and condensed into an incomplete sword intent.

Boom!

When he landed on the ground, the sword in the sky had engulfed his entire field of sight. But before the sword arrived, a terrifying tide of sword intent swept over. Lin Yun felt as if his whole body was being torn apart.

Thunderblitz Battle Physique!

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun released a violet glow with crimson flames blazing in his eyes. The strength of his physique surged at the same time. Rocks flew around as a violent gust and buzzing sword left everyone shocked.

In the blink of an eye, a sword had already arrived before he even had the time to think. He knew that he would be pierced and would lose his life if he couldn’t receive the sword.

In the moment when everyone felt that Lin Yun was about to die, he suddenly clapped his hands together and caught the sword between his palms.

Pffft!

Under the reverberation of the terrifying sword intent, Lin Yun spit up several mouthfuls of blood. The ground exploded with cracks as the sword intent spread out. However, Lin Yun did not take a single step back when he caught the sword between his hands.

“Go!” Lin Yun spoke with incredible difficulty. There was a trace of blood dripping down from his lips. He wanted to get the lady behind him to leave immediately.

“Not dead?” Bai Lixuan was briefly stunned. He never expected that Lin Yun would manage to catch his sword. But shortly after, he sneered coldly. He could tell that Lin Yun was struggling right now.

It wasn’t surprising that Lin Yun could catch his sword with the perfect Thunderblitz Battle Physique, but could Lin Yun catch the second one?

Crack!

But just when Bai Lixuan wanted to pull his sword out, it began to crack and broke into fragments. In the blink of an eye, he was only left with the sword hilt.

The broken sword physique? The pressure that Lin Yun felt instantly decreased. He couldn’t help thinking about his abnormal physique.

“Senior brother, catch this sword!” The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples threw their swords over. Their faces had changed dramatically when they saw Bai Lixuan’s sword breaking into fragments.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

In an instant, multiple swords flew over to Bai Lixuan. Bai Lixuan reached out for the nearest sword and stabbed out with it. The terrifying sword intent appeared once more, displaying the might to slice a river apart. Lin Yun awakened from his shock and his face was drained of colors. He squeezed his two fingers together, clamping the sword that was stabbing at him.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Before the boundless sword intent was unleashed, the sword broke into fragments once more. Once again, Bai Lixuan was only left with the hilt. It was a strange scene.

“Again!” He had swords from the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples around him. He casually reached out for another sword and brandished it over. However, Lin Yun’s fingers clamped onto that sword again.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

For a moment, the surrounding was covered in sword fragments as Lin Yun’s sword intent disseminated out like a flower blooming.

“This…”

“What’s going on?”

This abnormal scene left everyone stunned. They had no idea what was going on. Was Lin Yun so powerful?

Rustle!

Bai Lixuan wanted to grab another sword when he realized that all the swords thrown to him were broken.

“A chance!” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up and he took a step forward, unleashing the Dragon-Tiger Might. When the clouds and winds combined, Lin Yun’s aura violently surged.

But Lin Yun didn’t stop there. He took another step forward, manifesting a tiger behind him. Followed by another step, causing the tiger to be replaced by a dragon.

The images behind Lin Yun began to alternate between a dragon and a tiger, which seemed unfathomable. In the blink of an eye, the dragon and tiger appeared simultaneously and a mountain appeared behind them.

Then, Lin Yun’s foot touched the ground and he threw a punch. Bai Lixuan was surprised because he initially intended to grab another sword before discovering that they were all broken. So, in the end, he was forced to retaliate with a punch of his own.

Boom!

An explosion occurred from the collision. It was like two steel beasts colliding together, releasing a terrifying shockwave. But when the shockwave disappeared, an unbelievable scene unfolded before them. Bai Lixuan was actually blasted away by Lin Yun’s punch.

When Bai Lixuan landed on the ground, he took three steps back. Every single step he took would leave a crater beneath his feet. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Bai Lixuan retreated?”

The clash had shocked everyone. However, after throwing his punch, Lin Yun felt weak and couldn’t follow up on his attacks. Even if he still had the strength to attack, he wouldn’t take the risk.

Bai Lixuan only suffered because he was careless. If he had to execute the Dragon-Tiger Steps again, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to display such prowess. When Lin Yun turned around, he saw the young lady smiling at him with stars flickering in her eyes. She seemed to be admiring him.

Pffft!

Lin Yun vomited blood on the spot. He risked his life to create an opportunity for her to escape, but she was still sticking around?

“What are you doing?!” Lin Yun raged.

“I can’t move…” The young lady pitifully replied. She couldn’t get up on her feet, not to mention that even moving a little would make her suffer in pain.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun calmed down and started running, carrying the young lady in his hands. But when he got up on his feet, he could sense a sword aura slashing down at his back.

Clang!

The sword aura collided against his sword box. It was another Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciple who made a move against him. But fortunately, his Thunderblitz Battle Physique wasn’t broken. So Lin Yun wasn’t heavily injured. He gnashed his teeth and continued to run.

Whoosh!

After Bai Lixuan caught his breath, he appeared before the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples. He roared at them with a grim expression, “Chase!”

Not only the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples, but the other Xiantian Realm cultivators also chased after Lin Yun as their eyes turned red with greed. For a moment, tens of thousands of footsteps rang out.

Many buildings in the ruin started to collapse from the vibration, but no one could be bothered by it. All of them were looking at the blue-clothed figure, chasing closely behind.

Lin Yun turned around and his face turned pale from fear. There was a massive cloud of dust behind him, created by tens of thousands of Xiantian Realm cultivators. This scene could even cause one’s legs to go soft from fear.

“What did you snatch?” Lin Yun helplessly asked.

“Hehe. It’s just an inheritance treasure from the Palace Tomb.” The young lady chuckled, hooking her hands onto Lin Yun’s neck.

“And you can still laugh at this situation?” Lin Yun smiled bitterly. He had exhausted himself greatly from the previous fight. If everyone progressed at this pace, his pursuers would catch up to him sooner or later. Facing such a massive army, even taking out the token would be useless

Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!

But at this moment, a deafening clatter of hooves rang out, causing the earth to tremble. A herd of horses emitting a killing aura unique to demonic beasts appeared in the far horizon. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw the Dragon Blooded Horse that he hadn’t seen for a long time.

Lil’ Red had joined the herd of horses upon coming to the ruins. Lin Yun wasn’t too bothered back then, but he never expected that the Dragon Blooded Horse would come to his aid at such a critical moment.

“We’re saved!” Lin Yun rejoiced and quickened his steps.
