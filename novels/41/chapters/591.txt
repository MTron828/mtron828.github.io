Chapter 592 - Two Fiendgods

Even at the last second, the old man couldn’t see how Lin Yun swung his sword. In fact, he didn’t even know how he died. As for Lin Yun, he had already left with the flower.

Lin Yun didn’t have to think too much about the man as there was no way he would make friends with a demonic cultivator of an impure origin. Even if the Withernorth Sea was dangerous, there was no way he would work together with someone like the old man.

Lin Yun sensed that he couldn’t stay here for long, and since he could kill the old man, he might as well do it quickly with the Thunderbolt Slasher

Placing the Flower Burial Sword in the sword box, Lin Yun disappeared from where he stood. Not long after he left, thick bodied brown ants emerged from the sand and started to devour the corpses on the ground.

With thousands of people entering the Withernorth Sea, the serene desert had been disturbed. There were those who died in the hands of demonic beasts as their blood dyed the desert red. However, more people were killed by fellow humans. Each corner of the Withernorth Sea was covered with blood and bodies.

This was true even for the swamps. At one swamp in particular, countless corpses littered the ground. Most of the lifeless bodies were horribly mutilated and their blood added a putrid stench to the atmosphere.

At the center of the swamp, was a bizarre flower surrounded by mists, which made it look like a gigantic dragon. It was the Dragonification Herb, a rare treasure that would attract countless people’s attention if it was revealed in the outside world.

But right now, there were dozens of elite disciples looking at the Dragonification Herb with fear on their faces as they trembled. They were looking at a person standing beside the herb. That person was dressed in black and his cold gaze was on the herb. Additionally, blood was dripping from the sword in his right hand.

He was the Bloodwar Pavilion’s Ji Wuye, ranked fifty-three in the previous Draconic Banquet. He was known as the Bloody Butcher and his sword was famed for being fast and ruthless.

Initially, disciples from several sects were fighting for the Dragonification Herb, but none of them expected that Ji Wuye would suddenly join in and start killing everyone. In just the blink of an eye, he had killed over dozens of people, which terrified everyone badly.

“Ji Wuye, we give up on the Dragonification Herb. Can you let us off?”

“Young Master Ji, you’re a genius on the Dragoncloud Ranking. There’s no need for you to lower yourself to our level, right?”

“We didn’t know that you took a fancy to the Dragonification Herb.”

“Spare us!” The remaining disciples all begged for mercy.

“The Dragonification Herb is mine, to begin with. Do I even need you guys to let me have it? Tsk tsk.” Ji Wuye smiled weirdly, before his eyes flashed coldly, “I’ll give you guys a chance to live. You guys have three breaths. If you can outrun my sword, then your lives will be spared.”

“Run!” The remaining disciples ran without a second thought.

Looking at the disciples running for their lives, Ji Wuye wore a playful smile as he said, “Time’s up!”

The smile disappeared from his face and was replaced with a frightening coldness. The sword in his hand began to emit a crimson radiance as Ji Wuye fused his killing aura into it perfectly. When he swung his sword out, the crimson aura flew out from his sword and devoured everyone in a thousand meter radius.

“What’s wrong, I can’t move…”

“Damn it, what the hell is going on! My legs won’t listen to me!”

“Damn it!” The disciples all plunged into an abyss as the killing aura invaded their bodies. They could feel a chill in their spines and in the next second, countless sword rays flew out from Ji Wuye’s sword that killed everyone.

Cries rang out as mutilated corpses fell to the ground. When Ji Wuye sheathed his sword, no one remained standing. This was how terrifying Ji Wuye, the Bloody Butcher, was. It made sense since he was fifty-third on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

But there was still one person trying to crawl amid the corpses. After all, you could never underestimate a person’s will to survive.

“Ignorant,” smiled Ji Wuye savagely. The moment he finished talking, the person who tried to crawl out had a crimson line spreading out on his face and body. The pain made the person howl out bitterly before he burst into a mist of blood, leaving behind a crater as big as a few hundred meters.

“Everyone already died. Didn’t you wonder why you were still alive?” Ji Wuye sneered as he turned towards the Dragonification Herb.

The ground began to tremble violently at this moment as the mist around the herb was instantly sucked into the air. At the same time, Ji Wuye’s crimson aura grew even denser.

Within the terrifying crimson aura, a figure could be vaguely seen that emitted a boundless aura. Judging from his aura, he could step into the Yin-Yang stage anytime he wanted and he should be able to make a breakthrough easily with the Dragonification Herb. However, Ji Wuye showed no signs of making a breakthrough at all as he constantly refined his origin energy.

After he devoured the dragon-shaped mist, Ji Wuye retracted all the crimson aura around him. His aura had become even more powerful. When he opened his eyes, his pupils were filled with sword intent. Then, he opened his hand and revealed a crimson spider with seven profound lights. It was his martial soul, the Radiant Blood Spider that was in the profound seventh grade.

“The profound seventh grade… Those monstrous geniuses in the top ten reached the profound ninth grade before making a breakthrough into the Yin-Yang stage. I still have a long way to go, but it’s too slow trying to nourish it with origin energy and herbs. Looks like I have to fight for the Astral Pearl left behind by the empyrean,” muttered Ji Wuye. As he spoke, the Radiant Blood Spider crawled out and began to absorb the resentment lingering on the corpses.

In a different location, at a nearly dried-up lake, screams filled the air as blood splashed onto the ground. Dozens of people were wailing as they ran for their lives.

“You guys think you can escape?” A sneer rang out behind them. It turns out that they didn’t encounter a terrifying demonic beast, but a human that was even more terrifying than a monster.

They were easily killed by that man even though they brought out their trump cards. It was even more bizarre because the figure walked while waving his saber, but there weren’t any saber rays.

If someone looked carefully, they would notice a trace of fluctuations spreading out. There was a fine black saber ray that was sweeping through the crowd and claiming their lives. The person with the saber was naturally Ghost Blade Yan Kong who was ranked fifty-four on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

As he strolled around, no one was left standing. Looking at the corpses on the ground, Yan Kong cursed, “These cowards dared to destroy my Dragonslug Fruit!”

The Dragonslug Fruit didn’t belong to him at all and it was even destroyed from an intense battle. Yan Kong had merely passed by and flew into a rage when he found out about the Dragonslug Fruit. His brutality wasn’t inferior to Ji Wuye in any way.

Ji Wuye and Yan Kong were known as the two fiendgods from the previous Draconic Banquet. Although they belonged to a sect and weren’t demonic cultivators, they never hesitated when it came to killing someone. However, they wouldn’t simply kill anyone they saw. It was just that they had a brutal personality. Since they had similar personalities, they would fight whenever they ran into each other.

“The direction changed again…” Yan Kong frowned. “It’s troublesome trying to find the empyrean’s tomb in this damnable place.”
