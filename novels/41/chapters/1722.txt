Chapter 1723 – Compete

“I have no reason to refuse this opportunity, and I’m also grateful for this opportunity.” Lin Yun snet a serious look towards Mu Xueling. The Nine Lotus Diagram might be dangerous, but it was also an excellent opportunity for him. As long as Mu Xueling was willing, who knew how many geniuses were willing to give it a try? After all, this painting was entirely created with divine runes, and the value was unimaginable.

“What do I have to do?” Lin Yun asked. He knew that nothing was free in the world.

“Play the Ni Chang Dress Song well and help Junior Sister master the Nine Heavenly Profound Dance.” Mu Xueling said.

“Uh… I don’t need to do anything at the Nirvana Banquet?” Lin Yun asked. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“I’ll naturally be happy if you can be first in the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion, but can you do it? I don’t have much hope for you, so you can just do whatever you want.” Mu Xueling replied.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he bitterly smiled. It had been a long time since he was belittled.

“Saint Elder is really unfathomable, and I can’t see through you at all…” Lin Yun sighed after glancing at her.

“I’ll teach you the Nine Lotus Art first. Otherwise, you won’t be able to activate the Nine Lotus Diagram.” Mu Xueling said. When she was done, she pointed at Lin Yun’s forehead. As boundless information poured into his mind, Lin Yun closed his eyes to comprehend it and was soon proficient in it.

The Nine Lotus Art wasn’t a cultivation technique but a secret technique. It was a secret technique used to activate the Nine Lotus Diagram, and it was pretty easy to grasp. In reality, the Nine Lotus Diagram was a mighty treasure, and the Nine Lotus Art that Mu Xueling gave him was incomplete. The entire Nine Lotus Art could even control the Nine Lotus Diagram, unleashing various unfathomable abilities.

“I remembered it.” Lin Yun opened his eyes after a brief moment.

“Oh, what’s the difference between Golden Crow’s saint blood and divine blood?” Lin Yun asked. The altar's surface was made with saint blood, but the diagram was created with divine blood. So there must be a difference between the two.

“The Golden Crow is a saint beast at birth, which means their blood is saint blood. It’s hard for a Golden Crow to become a deity, and only a Golden Crow who became a deity can produce divine blood. Divine blood contains divine traits, and the divine runes in a painting can be preserved for eternity that way.” Mu Xueling explained.

“Understood.” Lin Yun wondered if he needed to obtain divine blood to engrave divine runes on the Divine Astral Flower. He began to wonder how Li Wuyou, who specially went to the Profound Amber Realm to retrieve the Vermillion Bird’s divine blood, was doing in the Kunlun Realm. Lin Yun couldn’t help reminiscing upon mentioning divine blood, and he dazed off.

“Lin Xiao, my junior sister, and I will leave first. It’ll depend on your fortune to see how much you can benefit from the Nine Lotus Diagram.” Mu Xueling said. She had no interest in knowing what Lin Yun was thinking right now.

“Big Brother Lin, don’t force yourself. The painting is dangerous.” Yue Weiwei warned before leaving with Mu Xueling. It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to be the only one left in this hall.

“I should give it my all now.” Lin Yun squinted his eyes, looking at the distant altar. It didn’t feel great to be belittled, especially by a woman, even if she was a Quasi-Saint who had grasped Imperial Tone.

Outside the Heavenly Fragrance Treasury, Mu Xueling, walking with Yue Weiwei, suddenly asked, “Lin Xiao is Lin Yun, right?”

“Lin Yun?” Yue Weiwei was briefly stunned before she put on a silly smile, “Senior Sister, what are you talking about?”

“He’s Flower Burial Lin Yun, the same person you ran into on the Heavenly Path. You came out of the divine mountain to break free from your father’s control to meet him, right?” Mu Xueling continued.

“Senior Sister, what are you talking about?” Yue Weiwei smiled.

“You accidentally called him Big Brother Lin at the West Garden Banquet, and I have already guessed it.” Mu Xueling replied. “You already knew his true identity, right? You kept it from me for so long.”

Seeing this, Yue Weiwei no longer feigned innocence and smiled, “I knew I wouldn’t be able to keep it from Senior Sister. But Senior Sister won’t make things difficult for him, right?”

“I should’ve guessed his true identity when he drank and sang back then. After all, if Flower Burial didn’t have that much charm, why would you sneak out of the divine mountain?” Mu Xueling turned back to the Heavenly Fragrance Treasury, and she continued, “I naturally won’t make things difficult for him, but he’s still far from being compatible with you. The golden age will arrive soon, and the Kunlun Realm will undergo a drastic transformation. He possesses a great treasure, and if he doesn’t have enough strength, he won’t even be able to protect himself, not to mention receive your father’s acknowledgment.”

“This is why Senior Sister activated the Nine Lotus Diagram?” Yue Weiwei asked.

“Why else?” Mu Xueling replied. “You think that just anyone can make me activate the Nine Lotus Diagram for them? The saint flames have nourished the Nine Lotus Diagram for nearly a millennium. But I also have some selfish thoughts in doing so.”

“What selfish thoughts?” Yue Weiwei asked curiously.

“That’s a secret.” Mu Xueling replied and retracted her gaze from the Heavenly Fragrance Treasury.

Squinting her eyes, Yue Weiwei smiled, “I’m guessing that it has something to do with the Blue Dragon Record.”

“But don’t rejoice so early. It’s uncertain if he can even make it out alive. Even if he managed to endure it, he might not be able to last long. Without great willpower, it’ll be difficult for him to obtain any harvest from the Nine Lotus Diagram.” Mu Xueling replied.

“Big Brother Lin will be able to do it!” Yue Weiwei said.

“I’ll wait and see, then. Who knows, maybe he hasn’t even ascended the altar now. After he has ascended the altar, the Nine Lotus Diagram will give him a greater surprise.” Mu Xueling replied.

“Senior Sister, you’re really annoying, and I’m getting angry. Big Brother Lin will surely be able to do it!” Yue Weiwei said unhappily.

Her reaction made Mu Xueling smile, and she knew that Yue Weiwei had really fallen for Lin Yun because she never saw Yue Weiwei care so much for someone.

Standing before the Golden Crow Altar, Lin Yun’s forehead was covered in beads of sweat. He spent nearly half an incense’s time to travel a thousand feet because the saint flames blazing on the altar were too intense, emitting a powerful saint aura.

He was struggling under the saint aura, even with the Blue Dragon Bone that had never failed him. He made it so far by purely relying on the Azure Dragon Saint Physique.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun circulated the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art and a hundred thousand dragon runes started appearing on his body's surface. As his heart pumped, his vitality coursed through his body like magma. When the hundred thousand dragon runes appeared, Lin Yun stomped his foot.

Lin Yun soared to the sky as the ground trembled and faced the saint flames on the altar head-on. But when he landed on the ground, he was forced down on his knees under the pressure of the divine runes. The heat from the Golden Crow Saint Flames on the altar was intense, and it felt like the flames were burning his face.

Raising his head with great difficulty, Lin Yun looked at the nine saint lotuses in the Nine Lotus Diagram. Each lotus was bewitching, containing massive and unbelievable mental energy. Facing the invisible pressure from the Nine Lotus Diagram, Lin Yun felt like he would collapse at any moment.

As the divine runes’ aura emitted from the diagram suddenly grew, Lin Yun was almost blown off the altar before he could even react. But when he was nearly blown off of the altar, he reached out and grabbed the edge of the altar, and was hovering in mid-air.

This made Lin Yun wear a bitter smile. Was the Nine Lotus Diagram trying to intimidate him? At this moment, he really believed that the nine lotuses contained intelligence.

“I won’t admit defeat so easily!” Lin Yun’s pupils flashed with stubbornness. As a dragon’s roar echoed within his body, the dragon runes gathered into his right arm and became as tough as a dragon’s claw.

With a sudden outburst of strength, Lin Yun yanked with his right hand and landed on the altar again. Since he was experienced this time, his hands joined together, and a pair of Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him.

The reason why he didn’t use the Golden Crow Wings before was a safety precaution. But it was the right opportunity now. The Golden Crow Wings were flickering with a metallic luster with twenty thousand saint runes engraved on them. When he activated the Golden Crow Wings, the wings could even obtain a resonation with the Golden Crow Altar.

As the golden crow aura that Lin Yun was emitting suddenly increased, he finally managed to resist the divine runes’ aura from the Nine Lotus Diagram.

With no hesitation, Lin Yun’s hands joined together and activated the Nine Lotus Art. When he circulated the Nine Lotus Art, the Nine Lotus Diagram finally became a little more friendly, and the painting was like a flying carpet hovering in the saint flames.

After recalling the Golden Crow Wings back into his body, Lin Yun landed on the diagram and sat on it. When he landed on the Nine Lotus Diagram, a heavenly dragon and a divine phoenix phenomenon appeared on his left and right sides.

When he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, he could feel boundless divine rune energy endlessly flowing into his body. This made his body tremble, and he could sense the energy coursing throughout his four limbs and internal organs.

The surface of his body also became red, and he could clearly sense his dragon origin, mental energy, and physique were greedily devouring the divine rune’s energy. But before he could think about it, a burning sensation soon spread throughout his body, and he gritted his teeth to persevere.

Not long later, the dragon origin ocean within his violet palace began to boil, and the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron within the ocean started to rumble. At this moment, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon showed signs of making a breakthrough.

This instantly made Lin Yun rejoice because the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon had been stuck in the fifth stage for a long time. But when he just came in contact with the Nine Lotus Diagram, his sword sutras’ bottleneck began to loosen before he made a mental cultivation breakthrough, which was a pleasant surprise.

“The effects are truly worthy of being a painting created with divine runes. So I should try and stay here for as long as possible.” Lin Yun muttered. But he also knew he couldn’t afford to treat it lightly because Mu Xueling said that the saint lotuses would devour his vitality.

With a smile, Lin Yun decided to compete with the Nine Lotus Diagram. After making up his mind, he no longer hesitated and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon at full force to devour the divine runes’ energy that was being emitted from the painting.

Simultaneously, Lin Yun could clearly sense that the saint lotuses were absorbing his vitality. But Lin Yun didn’t have to worry about that factor with the Blue Dragon Bone.

As time passed, Lin Yun’s body was covered in nine-colored flames. The nine saint lotuses produced a flame of different colors that enveloped him.

Looking from afar, it looked as though there was a sword stabbed into the Nine Lotus Diagram, tempered by the flames. But it wasn’t as calm as it appeared because Lin Yun and the nine lotuses were competing.

The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon is really strong. Haha, the Iris Sword Saint didn’t let me down. Lin Yun inwardly muttered.

In the beginning, the nine lotuses didn’t want to devour Lin Yun’s vitality, fearing that they might suck Lin Yun dry. They decided to take their time, but they soon noticed that something wasn’t right. With the Blue Dragon Bone replenishing Lin Yun’s vitality, his vitality was nearly endless.

The divine runes on the lotuses that had been nourished for a millennium were swiftly decreasing, and the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron was like a vortex absorbing the divine blood. Divine blood contained divine traits that could be used to create divine runes. So it was tough for the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron to shake them.

But the nine saint lotuses panicked because the divine blood was their foundation. If the divine blood was completely absorbed by Lin Yun, they would suffer a considerable loss. Thus, the nine saint lotuses began to absorb Lin Yun’s vitality together. But even so, they couldn’t beat Lin Yun.

If Mu Xueling was here, her jaw would probably fall to the ground with shock.
