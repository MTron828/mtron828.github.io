Chapter 1838 - Return of a King

While everyone was being amazed, the man was sent flying away, and the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon broke free of his grasp. This made him take several steps back before he fell onto the ground with one knee and threw out blood from his mouth.

Although the white-clothed man and women said that they weren’t interested in the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, their gazes followed the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon. When the dragon flew out again, the white-clothed man and woman exchanged a glance before they smiled. They both had reservations about each other and didn’t dare to move.

In reality, they had reservations just by being here alone because they were powerful. If they faced the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown and had to retaliate, they might have had to bring out more of their cultivation, and it would be dangerous at that time.

The surrounding atmosphere became weird as everyone’s gazes fell onto the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon. None of them dared to move, but a decisive light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils with sword rays surging on him before he dashed forth.

In the next moment, he landed before the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon, and no one dared to stop him. Instead, they all had mockery in their pupils because even the Fire God General couldn’t subdue the dragon, so Lin Yun’s act was no different from courting death.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Lin Yun made his move and grabbed onto the neck of the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon. As a dragon aura burst out, lightning began to flicker on the dragon and Lin Yun was forced to retreat. He was placed under great pressure, but he firmly held onto the dragon with no intention of giving up.

“I don’t believe I can’t deal with you!” Lin Yun’s face was pale with beads of sweat rolling down his forehead from the piercing pain coming from his palm. But his gaze was firm, and he started pouring his sword intent into the dragon. At the same time, he also circulated the two body-refining techniques to restrain the dragon aura that was being given off by the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon.

As a dazzling radiance shone from Lin Yun’s palm, the terrifying lightning and powerful dragon aura caused ripples to spread out within the surroundings. Space also began to distort, and Lin Yun’s palm began to start bleeding.

Facing the powerful resistance from the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, the sword intent within Lin Yun’s pupils grew even more ferocious, and the hundred thousand golden-purple dragon runes became berserk before pouring into the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon.

When the dragon runes he poured shattered, the Blue Dragon Bone continued to produce more dragon runes. Just like that, Lin Yun lasted longer than the man wearing a bamboo hat, and those who were laughing at Lin Yun quickly became shocked.

“Interesting… How did he manage to achieve an endless amount of dragon runes…?” The woman muttered to herself with her pupils filled with surprise.

“Perhaps he has a divine dragon bone.” The white-clothed man said.

But the woman shook her head and smiled, “I have personally investigated him, but he doesn’t have a divine dragon bone. If he does possess a divine dragon bone, he’d be dead by now.”

When the white-clothed man heard what she said, a chill flashed within the depth of his pupils. The woman also gave the white-clothed man a playful smile.

Under countless gazes of disbelief, the lightning and dragon aura released by the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon began to decline. It seems to have acknowledged Lin Xiao.

“How is this impossible?!” Exclamations resounded from the surroundings because this was something that even the Fire God General failed to do.

Under everyone’s shocked gazes, the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon transformed back into a crown and fell into Lin Yun’s hands. This was an unbelievably beautiful crown, and the top of the crown was a Golden-Purple Divine Dragon’s engraving shrouding the four vertical golden-purple metal pieces. There was one on the forehead, two by the ears, and one at the back of the head.

It looked like a helmet, but it wasn’t that tightly enclosed. Furthermore, it looked beautiful and emitted a noble aura. This wasn’t something that could come from a helmet. The Golden-Purple Divine Dragon was adorned on the crown, and its pupils were two gems.

“It’s really heavy!” Lin Yun descended from the sky and held onto the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown with great difficulty. It wasn’t physically heavy, but it seemed to carry a certain destiny. It was just like how the crown of an emperor couldn’t be worn by beggars.

Holding onto the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, Lin Yun would carry the destiny of the divine dragon lineage’s royal family.

“Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, he’s actually holding it!” Everyone in the surroundings were briefly stunned before they looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.

On the other hand, the holy land geniuses were disappointed. Even Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi sighed, but they weren’t exactly too surprised. They could only say that it was as expected of Lin Xiao. The atmosphere in the hall suddenly changed with a murderous aura enveloping the entire hall.

“You’re unworthy of it!” The Fire God General became furious and was the first to make a move against Lin Yun. When he made the move, everyone else dashed over, charging toward Lin Yun. There was no exception that they were all pinnacle Profound Life Stage experts.

“Damn it!” Lin Yun cursed, finding himself in an awkward position. He couldn’t even move a bit, not to mention wielding his sword because this Golden-Purple Dragon Crown was too heavy.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

In the end, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and could only place the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown on his head.

“No!” The white-clothed man could no longer maintain his composure, and he yelled.

“Carry on watching.” Madam Tian smiled as she stopped the white-clothed man with one hand.

“You dare stop me?!” The white-clothed man became furious with horrifying sword intent shining within his pupils. But the woman wasn’t afraid and looked at him in the eyes with flowers blooming in her pupils.

The two were facing off with each other as a terrifying destructive aura shone in their pupils. It was as though everyone in this hall would be erased if they made a move.

While they were facing off, Lin Yun finally wore the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown with dazzling golden-purple radiance shining from his body, accompanied by a powerful descending pressure. When he wore the crown, it was as though he became the lord of this world, and even Saint Lords had to bow to him.

A metal piece covered his forehead, and there was a crimson ancient rune engraved on it, as though the king had returned after a hundred thousand years.

“The Golden-Purple Dragon Crown…” Lin Yun clenched his fist and couldn’t help wearing a smile. This naturally made the Fire God General and everyone else rushing over towards him surprised.

“Time for you guys to learn a lesson.” A cold light flashed within his pupils when he looked at the Fire God General’s group of nine coming in his direction. Facing these nine pinnacle Profound Life Stage experts, he didn’t have the slightest fear within his pupils.

He swiftly soared to the sky before pushing his palm forth. Accompanied by a divine dragon’s roar, Lin Yun’s pupils became golden-purple, and his palm instantly sent the nine people coming at him flying away. Aside from the three God Generals, there were six others that rolled on the ground and threw out blood.

This instantly left everyone in the hall stumped. This was the power of the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown? Lin Yun had just worn it and hadn’t refined it, but it could already allow someone at the Dragon Pulse Realm to easily defeat a few people at the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage. Wasn’t this a little too unbelievable?

“H-How did he manage to do it?” For the first time, the woman was surprised.

Meanwhile, the white-clothed man gradually calmed down and even wore a smile. Lin Yun gave him a lot of surprises, but he would rather not have those surprises because he nearly had a heart attack.

As for Lin Yun, he had no idea that he had just brushed past the gate of hell.
