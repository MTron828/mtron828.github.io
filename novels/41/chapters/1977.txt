Chapter 1978 - Convinced

“You know of the Young Master Wushuang as well?” Lin Yun was surprised. Even Bai Xiao knew about this person, proving that Young Master Wushuang seemed to have a background.

Bai Xiao smiled, “Ye Qingtian, have you forgotten my surname? I’m a direct descendant of the Bai Clan.”

Lin Yun finally understood what was going on. It turned out that he didn’t notice it since it was the darkest under the lightpost.

Bai Xiao smiled, “Let me tell you about it. The six holy lands often interact with each other. We might call it ‘interaction’, but you should know what it actually is. It can be considered a competition or provocation.”

Lin Yun nodded his head. This was the cultivating world and the competition was between the younger generations. Even if they appeared to be friendly on the surface, things would change when they fought. After all, the Heavenly Dao Sect was known as the strongest holy land within the Eastern Desolation, but it was unavoidable for them to be challenged.

“But it’s different this time because everyone knows that Young Master Wushuang is using this opportunity to get close to my holy maiden,” Bai Xiao smiled.

“It’s natural for a fair lady to be courted. I have long heard that the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden’s name has spread throughout the Eastern Desolation, even throughout the Divine Dragon Empire.” Lin Yun wasn’t too surprised about that.

“The Bai Clan’s seniors are also satisfied with Young Master Wushuang. He’s the young master of a musical clan, and the Bai Clan’s inheritance is lacking, if you really compare them.”

“Is that so?” Lin Yun smiled. He wasn’t too bothered about it.

“Don’t underestimate the musical clans,” Bai Xiao said.

Lin Yun merely smiled and didn’t make any explanation. He wanted to think highly of the musical clans but couldn’t after defeating Mei Zihua during the Nirvana Banquet. Speaking of which, Mei Zihua’s reputation wasn’t inferior to this Young Master Wushuang.

The musical clans might be strong, but their young masters weren’t the strongest. It was fine even if they were the strongest because that was what he specialized in, beating the strongest.

Bai Xiao naturally noticed Ye Qingtian’s disdain for the musical clans, and he couldn’t help feeling that Ye Qingtian was really cocky. He continued, “It was fine if that was the case, but the relationship between Shuying and Young Master Wushuang is actually pretty good.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun’s face changed slightly.

“Young Master Wushuang is proficient in music dao and specializes in the erhu. His talent is unimaginable.”

“I also know a thing or two about music dao,” Lin Yun smiled modestly.

But Bai Xiao replied in disdain, “You’re a talented swordsman, but forget about music dao. You probably don’t even know what an erhu is. It’s a long-lost instrument within Kunlun Realm. But, thanks to Flower Burial, it has re-emerged during the Nirvana Banquet.”

“Is Flower Burial really that strong?” Lin Yun asked.

“To put it appropriately, you’re nothing compared to Flower Burial,” Bai Xiao looked at Lin Yun in disdain.

Lil’ Purple couldn’t help laughing out loud within the Iris Secret Realm.

Wearing an awkward smile, Lin Yun asked, “Isn’t that an exaggeration?”

“You can only be cocky within the Heavenly Dao Sect, but Flower Burial’s name has long spread throughout the Kunlun Realm. Outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield, he slew a Saint Lord when he was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm,” Bai Xiao said with his brow raised.

“I heard that he made use of a Sovereign Saint Artifact to achieve that, and that he nearly died because of it,” Lin Yun argued.

“That’s why I said you’re inexperienced. Do you know what kind of treasure a Sovereign Saint Artifact is? Ordinary Dragon Pulse Realms can’t even use a Sovereign Saint Artifact, not to mention slaying a Saint Lord with it,” Bai Xiao smiled, shaking his head. Seeing that Lin Yun still wanted to argue, he continued, “Listen to me first.”

Lin Yun’s lips twitched, but he kept quiet.

“Back on the Heavenly Path, Flower Burial became famous throughout the Kunlun Realm as the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path. All of the champions are considered monstrous geniuses in the golden generation, but if you have to say which of them is first, it would be Flower Burial,” Bai Xiao said.

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling speechless, wondering who had said that.

“There’s nothing the other eight can do about it, even if they’re unconvinced,” Bai Xiao said. “Back then, everyone thought Flower Burial had died outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield, but who could’ve known that he was also proficient in music dao? He became the champion of the Nirvana Banquet and even made the Three-Lives Tree bloom.

“Even Mei Zihua of the musical clan admitted his loss, losing eight of his maids to Flower Burial—tsk, tsk, flowers that only bloom for one person. Just imagine that and look at yourself again…” Bai Xiao said in disdain. “He shone brightly during the Nirvana Banquet while you sneaked into the Celestial Pool to peek at the holy maiden. He’s first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking while you begged for mercy under Zhang Yue. He might be at the Quasi-Saint Realm now, and you’re still peeking at the holy maiden showering.”

Lin Yun wanted to explain for himself, but his words were stuck in his throat.

“What’s the matter? Are you unconvinced? Isn’t what I said right?” Bai Xiao asked.

“I’m convinced,” Lin Yun replied with a grievance in his chest. What else could he say?

“So don’t even think about our holy maiden and spend your time well here, not to mention you can’t leave, anyways. If it’s Flower Burial, the Nether Orchid Sword Array wouldn’t be able to stop him,” Bai Xiao smiled.

Lin Yun was speechless when he heard that, especially the respect Bai Xiao had on his face when he mentioned Flower Burial. This really made Lin Yun speechless, and he didn’t know how to refute that.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Let’s take a step back. Even if you’re not Flower Burial, what can you do if you go out? Do you know about music dao? Can you play the erhu? You’ll only be embarrassed if you go out, and Young Master Wushuang probably wants you to go so that he could embarrass you.”

Lin Yun initially wanted to stop this topic, but Bai Xiao couldn’t stop. He asked, “Are you sure that I can’t leave this place?”

“I won’t stop you if you can leave, so you can go ahead and try,” Bai Xiao smiled.

Watch well, then. Lin Yun wanted to give it a try, but he came to his senses because it looked stupid to be unconvinced by himself. If he left this place, the misunderstanding would only become more complicated. He had already made up his mind that he would stay here and not make more trouble for Bai Shuying.

“Don’t cower,” Bai Xiao smiled.

Lin Yun calmed down and became tranquil, facing Bai Xiao’s provocation. He said, “I do know music dao.”

He turned around and left, practicing his sword on Remorse Cliff.

Ye Qingtian’s response made Bai Xiao smile because Ye Qingtian never cowered, even when facing a Saint Lord. But he could only be convinced by facing him, Bai Xiao!

To disregard Young Master Wushuang, did Ye Qingtian think he was Flower Burial? So what if Ye Qingtian was unconvinced? He could only suck it up, whether he liked it or not.

Two days later, Young Master Wushuang of the Divine Dao Pavilion finally arrived. This was an official exchange between two holy lands, and Young Master Wushuang was hosting several ‘guests’ within the Dustless Palace. They were the likes of Bai Yizhou, Zhang Kui, and Ye Qinghong, the representatives of the four big clans.

Bai Yizhou, Zhang Kui, and Ye Qinghong were honored. They were descendants of Ancient Saint Clans and nobles within the Heavenly Dao Sect. This was why they didn’t place the other saint disciples, aside from those of the four clans, in their eyes. But their birth was nothing compared to Young Master Wushuang.

The musical clans were ancient, and they even had Grandmaster Musicians who grasped the Divine Dragon Tone in their clans, and Grandmaster Musicians were comparable to Emperor Realm powerhouses. Those responsible for ceremonial music throughout the Divine Dragon Empire came from the musical clans.

The musical clans were noble within the Divine Dragon Empire, possessing a unique position. They would often have the opportunity to play for the Empress as well. So even if Young Master Wushuang was young, he might have seen the Empress before.

The Empress was publicly known to be the strongest existence in this era, and she was a god-like figure who drew respect everywhere. She was a legend, to begin with. Not to mention the Blue Dragon Record would soon appear, and this made everyone even more respectful towards the Empress.

Bai Yizhou, Zhang Kui, and Ye Qinghong wouldn’t be so respectful if Young Master Wushuang was only a genius within the Divine Dao Pavilion. But things were different, in addition to his background.

Young Master Wushuang was elegant and graceful, as rumored, permeating the aura of nobility. But he didn’t show it, even as he chatted with Bai Yizhou, Zhang Kui, and Ye Qinghong. He had no air around him, which further made Bai Yizhou, Zhang Kui, and Ye Qinghong feel honored. Amongst the three, Bai Yizhou was especially respectful to Young Master Wushuang.

“Tomorrow is the exchange between the two holy lands, and I apologize in advance if I take anything too far. I have nothing against you guys, but I can’t help it because of my position,” Young Master Wushuang smiled. “This is why I’m inviting you guys over privately.”

“Young Master Wushuang, you’re too polite. We’re descendants of Ancient Saint Clans, while you’re from a musical clan. How could competition between holy lands possibly affect our relationship?” Bai Yizhou smiled. His words had a hidden meaning; their Ancient Saint Clans were above the Heavenly Dao Sect. So they wouldn’t be bothered about the honor of the sect.

Young Master Wushuang inwardly sneered but didn’t show it on his face. He asked, “I heard that there’s a newly emerged genius in the sword recently, and his name is Ye Qingtian, who caused quite the commotion during the conferring ceremony.”

“He’s already dead. That person is the scum of my Ye Clan. Half a month ago, he intruded the forbidden ground and was personally killed by the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint!” Ye Qinghong sneered.

“That’s a pity, then. I still wanted to get acquainted with him,” Young Master Wushuang said.

“There’s no need to find pity for him. He’s the scum of the sect. Even if he’s not dead, he’s definitely crippled. After all, how can anyone survive an attack of the enraged Heavenly Jade Sword Saint?” Zhang Kui smiled.

Bai Yizhou continued in disdain, “Even if he’s not crippled, he’s nothing compared to Young Master Wushuang. Someone like him is a genius swordsman? He’s only lucky to refine a saint origin, and everyone in the sect knows that he’s scum. He’s still the same scum as he was a year ago.”

Young Master Wushuang merely smiled and not paying attention to their words. It looked like he couldn’t see this ‘genius’ anymore. He was still looking forward to seeing this person, who was Bai Shuying’s pursuer.

Right then, music echoed from outside the Dustless palace, instantly making Young Master Wushuang’ pupils light up, and he instantly knew what instrument was being played. “Erhu!”

Bai Yizhou smiled, “I heard that Young Master Wushuang is the strongest in the erhu within the Kunlun Realm, and you have long surpassed Flower Burial. I’m looking forward to seeing it in our exchange tomorrow.”

Young Master Wushuang merely replied with a smile, not agreeing or denying that.
