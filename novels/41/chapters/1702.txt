Chapter 1703 – This Is Lin Xiao?

Lin Yun’s sudden appearance not only surprised the Exquisite Court’s party but also the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples.

“Lin Xiao actually made a move…”

“He does have some courage.” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples might not like him, but they hated the Exquisite Corut even more, especially their despicable means. When they saw how Lin Yun forced Lan Hongyan back with a wave of his hand, their eyes lit up. Those like Zhao Mu, Xiang Feiluan, and Zuo Hongyun, who had an intense enmity for Lin Yun, were briefly stunned by this scene and were also surprised.

“He really stood out.” Xiang Feiluan said. He was surprised.

“It’s just brute strength. If he has the ability, why doesn’t he use his music dao? Doesn’t it look bad on him to use brute force?” Zhang Mu said in disdain.

Everyone fell silent because many disciples shared the same thoughts as Zhang Mu. They had to admit Lin Yun was strong, or he wouldn’t be able to cripple Jiang Feng. But they were competing in music dao here, not martial dao.

Lan Hongyan’s face was terrifyingly dark when she was forced to take a step back by Lin Yun. Just when she wanted to make a move, Xu Dongfei stopped her.

Xu Dongfei squinted his eyes with a vicious light flashing across his pupils. He snickered, “Even if my Exquisite Court is vicious, we’re still competing in music dao. But you suddenly launched a sneak attack with brute strength. Aren’t you more despicable?”

“Is that so?” Lin Yun smiled and took a step forth. “Why don’t we have some fun, then?”

When Lin Wan heard that Lin Yun was going to make a move, she first rejoiced before she became concerned, “Young Master Lin Xiao, he’s the chief disciple of the Exquisite Court. He has a terrifying attainment in music dao, and he has long achieved the pinnacle of Noble Tone.”

“Understand now? You’re still not qualified to fight me. Even those Ancient Saint Clan’s disciples are nothing in my eyes. So who do you think you are? You’re not qualified. No one in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion is qualified except for the Profound Fairy!” Xu Dongfei mocked. He was extremely arrogant, and he didn’t bother concealing it at all.

His words nearly made the faces of all Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples pale. After all, no one could accept being mocked in their own territory, not to mention Xu Dongfei even said that he wanted to fight the Profound Fairy. But there was nothing they could do but suck it up.

“Ha, don’t tell me that the Profound Fairy is an ugly bitch. Why isn’t she showing up after everyone in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion was defeated? Don’t tell me that the Profound Fairy is a turtle who only knows how to hide!” Lan Hongyan said with disdain with her brow raised.

But the moment she said that she took a slap to her face that caused half of her face to swell. Everything happened too quickly, and Xu Dongfei couldn’t respond quick enough. He could only sense a breeze blowing past, and Lan Hongyan was already slapped.

As for Xu Dongfei, he took a step back by instinct. When he came to his senses, Lin Yun already returned to where he initially stood.

“How dare you slap me!” Lan Hongyan flew into a rage and looked hideous, with half of her face swollen.

“Well done!” Luo Shuyi snorted and came forth. She roared, “You bitch. Has our Profound Fairy offended you? Do you have to use such vicious words to insult her? The Profound Fairy is ten thousand times more beautiful than you. Where did you get the face to say that our Profound Fairy is ugly?”

Luo Shuyi was genuinely furious this time. Since she was well-educated, it was rare for her to scold someone. But today, what Lan Hongyan said made her mad. Not only was Lan Hongyan vicious in using poison in a sparring match, but she even insulted Yue Weiwei in public. So how could she still endure it?

“My mouth is mine, and it’s my freedom to say whatever I want. Who are you to interfere with me?” Lan Hongyan said coldly.

Lin Yun smiled and said, “My hands are mine, and it’s my freedom to slap whoever I want. Carry on if you dare, and I’ll give you a slap for every sentence you say.”

“You think I don’t dare…” Lan Hongyan was furious, but she swallowed her words after seeing Lin Yun’s smile.

She was afraid, but another slap flew over, sending her flying away. As blood splattered, her entire face became swollen. Lin Yun didn’t hold back at all and used the Azure Dragon Grasp with his slap. This naturally made the Exquisite Court’s party furious, and their elders’ faces were terrifyingly dark.

“Senior Brother, he slapped me!” Lan Hongyan cried out.

Xu Dongfei’s lip twitched because Lin Yun was a little unreasonable. Since when was there someone like him in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion? He thought Lin Yun would hold back since he had already made his move. But he never expected Lin Yun to suddenly give Lan Hongyan another slap.

Even everyone from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion was terrified because Lin Yun was really overbearing. Then again, they weren’t too surprised because he even dared to cripple Jiang Feng. What was there that he didn’t dare to do? That fellow was a barbarian, to begin with.

“Don’t look at me… I’m just a barbarian, and I can hit anyone I want! Everyone in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion knows that I’m a barbarian. If you’re unhappy, why don’t we have some fun? We’ll compete with just our music dao!” Lin Yun smiled with his eyes squinted, looking at Xu Dongfei.

He had vented all his anger from the two slaps, but he still wasn’t happy. Where did this group of idiots come from to say that Yue Weiwei was ugly and only she was qualified to fight him?

Qualified? Where did Xu Dongfei get his qualification from? They were just someone with a wretched mouth and in need of a beating.

Xu Dongfei’s face was cold, and he said, “I already said that you’re not qualified. If the Profound Fairy isn’t coming out, I’ll leave, then. But I’m afraid that the entire Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea will feel that your Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion isn’t qualified to participate in the Nirvana Banquet at that time. You think a barbarian like you can slap the faces of everyone in the world?”

“If you defeat him, the Profound Fairy will fight you.” A cold voice resounded right at this moment. While a commotion came from outside the Cloud Fragrance Hall, Mu Xueling came in with a group of elders. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

When the three elders from the Exquisite Court saw Mu Xueling’s appearance, their faces became grave. They didn’t dare to look down on this Saint Elder, who was younger than all of them.

“Saint Elder, can we take your words seriously?” An elder asked, looking at Mu Xueling.

“A promise is a promise.” Mu Xueling coldly replied. She then looked at Lin Yun and said, “If you lose, I’ll make you throw up all the Profound Saint Pellets you ate. Since you like to call yourself a barbarian, I’ll fulfill your wish this once.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched because he knew that Mu Xueling was serious about what she said. But he couldn’t imagine the scene of Mu Xueling giving him a beating.

Shrugging his shoulder, Lin Yun looked at Xu Dongfei with a smile, “Brother Xu, come on.”

“Since the Saint Elder has spoken, I’ll give a barbarian like you the honor, then. But music dao is more terrifying than martial dao. So don’t be alarmed if I accidentally injure you.” Xu Dongfei smiled.

“That is also what I wanted to say.” Lin Yun responded with a smile.

“Are they really going to compete in music dao?”

“Is Lin Xiao insane? Who the hell is he to say he can win with his music dao…”

“If he loses, the Profound Fairy will have no path of retreat. Can he do it?”

The Exquisite Court didn’t have much response, but everyone from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion broke into an uproar with doubts about Lin Yun.

Xu Dongfei had captured this all with his eyes, and he sneered as he took out a long flute from his robes. When he started playing the flute, piercing flute music manifested into boundless musical notes that swept out, pressuring Lin Yun.

As Xu Dongfei’s hair and clothes fluttered, he emitted boundless noble-like pressure. Anyone could tell how terrifying Xu Dongfei was; he was much stronger than Lan Hongyan.

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples fell silent, and their faces were covered with concern. They didn’t believe that Lin Yun could beat Xu Dongfei in terms of music dao. They could foresee Lin Yun going down on his knees. After all, none of the present disciples could bear the pressure coming from Xu Dongfei.

Lin Yun’s foot moved, and he took three steps back. When he took three steps back, he suddenly turned around and landed on a stone platform with the Thunderstorm Zither appearing on his lap.

A sinister light flashed across Xu Dongfei’s pupils as the saint rune within his profound palace lit up. As the boundless mental energy surged from his profound palace, it significantly strengthened his attack. Not giving Lin Yun a chance to respond, he wanted to immediately suppress Lin Yun before Mu Xueling.

“This much still isn’t enough.” Lin Yun smiled, but his pupils were filled with a chill. He executed the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. As a connection between him and the Thunderstorm Zither was formed, the boundless thunderstorm energies were mobilized within the zither.

The next moment, zither music resounded, and a thunderstorm suddenly appeared. The sky immediately became dark, and the flute music that charging over was stopped.

When Xu Dongfei raised his head, he could see a dragon wandering within the thunderclouds, stirring a boundless power between heaven and earth. This shocked Xu Dongfei. His heart sank when he looked at Lin Yun again because he knew Lin Yun had hidden his true strength.

He no longer dared to treat Lin Yun lightly. As his hair fluttered in the wind, crimson lights shone out from his body and merged with the flute music. Under the crimson light, the flute music changed and dissolved into a crimson liquid that looked like blood. Purgatory was then instantly formed.

But Lin Yun calmly looked at Xu Dongfei coldly as his ten fingers danced on the zither. Every time he strumed his zither, the heavens would tremble, and a bolt of lightning would descend. Lin Yun’s zither music became even more ferocious when the thunder rumbled. But the next rumble of thunder would overlap with the zither music, and the zither music gradually became louder. Like that, the zither music and rumbling thunder competed, causing the entire Cloud Fragrance Hall to tremble.

This was an endless cycle, and no one could differentiate the zither music and rumbling thunder any longer. They could only feel that Lin Yun was competing with the heavens.

After ten rounds, Lin Yun raised his hand, and the crimson purgatory was torn into pieces, causing Xu Dongfei to take ten-odd steps back and throw out a mouthful of blood.

At this moment, the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples were dumbfounded as they looked at Lin Yun. They were all stumped and wondered if this was really Lin Yun. No one dared to believe this scene, including Zhang Mu, Zuo Hongyun, and Xiang Feiluan.
