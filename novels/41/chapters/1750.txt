Chapter 1751 – Bad Intentions (1)

Half an incense later, Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei saw Mu Xueling. She was playing the zither by the lakeside, and there was an ancient book on the table.

“Senior Sister, it’s beautiful.” Yue Weiwei praised.

Lin Yun shared the same thoughts. The ancient song played by Mu Xueling was beautiful. Her attainment in music dao reached a height that Lin Yun couldn’t imagine, and he could also sense she could take a step anytime she wanted, comprehending the Divine Dragon Tone.

Mu Xueling wouldn’t show any emotions most of the time, except for her doting on Yue Weiwei. So when she saw Yue Weiwei’s arrival, she couldn’t help smiling. Lin Yun could finally see her true appearance with the Sword Heart.

Faint sunlight shone on her that made her look like a goddess. When Yue Weiwei spoke about the objective of their visit, Mu Xueling’s face changed a little, and she looked at Lin Yun, “I can only ensure your safety. I can’t ensure that you can obtain the Divine Azure Order.”

The Divine Azure Order was a combination of the Wind God Order and Thunder God Order. With the Divine Azure Order, one could open up many ancient inheritances of the Azure Dragon’s lineage. This was the dream of everyone in the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion. So it was uncertain if they could acknowledge Lin Yun.

Three thousand years could turn a legend into a myth; a hundred thousand years were even longer. So no one could guarantee that those left behind would oblige to the oath made by their ancestors.

“I know. Thank you, Saint Elder.” Lin Yun nodded. He had no interest in wielding the entire Azure Dragon’s lineage. He only needed Saint Elder to ensure he could negotiate with the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion.

“It’s fine. I’m happy that you can be first on the Nirvana Banquet.” Mu Xueling said, looking at Lin Yun.

Is she happy? Lin Yun smiled because he couldn’t sense it at all.

“Big Brother Lin, you are already first on the Nirvana Banquet. After leaving the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion, will you still play the zither and flute?” Yue Weiwei asked.

Lin Yun was stunned when he heard that. He probably would, but not as fanatically as now.

“Then, play well today.” Yue Weiwei said. She knew what Lin Yun was thinking.

Mu Xueling merely glanced at him before leaving the table with a book.

“I’ll not embarrass myself before Saint Elder.” Lin Yun wasn’t too willing. Mu Xueling’s skills were a hundred times better than his, and it was the same as Lu Yuxi wanting to compete with him in swordsmanship.

“It’s fine. You play well, and I like it. You have something on you that others don’t. Although you restrained yourself, something is lacking in your music. You might as well fuse your Heavenly Dome Sword Intent into your music.” Mu Xueling said.

Glancing at her, Lin Yun didn’t know if what she said was true. But it was unavoidable for him to be happy upon receiving her praises.

“I’ll give it a try, then.” Lin Yun walked to the table and pondered for a long time. He ultimately didn’t make a move. Although Mu Xueling said that he played well, he didn’t want to be belittled by her when the time really came for him to play.

“Big Brother Lin, you can just play something casually. I believe Senior Sister won’t laugh at you.” Yue Weiwei smiled.

“Alright.” Lin Yun placed his hands on the zither and played something from his previous life, Three Stanzas of Plum Blossoms. When the music resounded, Yue Weiwei and Mu Xueling felt that the music was beautiful and its artistic concept was noble, like a plum blossom standing in the snow.

As Lin Yun continued to play, Yue Weiwei and Mu Xueling’s faces gradually changed. Mu Xueling, reading her book, couldn’t help turning over. There were ups and downs in the melody, rigidity and softness. It felt like a plum blossom before they showed different poses. When the music climaxed, Lin Yun’s ten fingers danced on the zither and repeated the melody.

But it was different this time as the plum blossom was unyielding in the blizzard before blooming after three sways.

As music lingered on the island, Mu Xueling and Yue Weiwei exchanged glances. They both had shock on their faces. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“What’s wrong? Why aren’t you guys saying anything?” Lin Yun smiled.

Yue Weiwei’s face blushed at Lin Yun being so shameless. They naturally didn’t say anything because Lin Yun played it well, and he was clearly asking to be praised. So she felt she couldn’t praise him or he would be too complacent.

“What’s this song?” Mu Xueling asked.

“Three Stanzas of Plum Blossoms.” Lin Yun said.

“As expected.” Mu Xueling nodded. She could already tell that the artistic concept in this music had something to do with plum blossoms, and she praised, “This is a fitting name. If you go to the Dual Moon Lake now, the Three-Lives Tree might give you a Three-Lives Fruit.”

“There’s no need.” Lin Yun had a phobia of Dual Moon Lake and didn’t want to go there. Furthermore, he wasn’t sure he could obtain another Three-Lives Fruit, since it was only a possibility.

Simultaneously, the Dual Moon Lake was filled with people. A towering ancient tree enveloped in saint radiance slowly appeared from the bottom of the sapphire lake. When the tree completely appeared, the pavilion master waved his hand, and seven of the top ten on the Nirvana Banquet went over.

Those in the top hundredth followed behind them. As for the other guests, they could only watch on the lakeside. When the Three-Lives Tree appeared, it would no longer test a person’s devotion to love. While they walked on the lake’s surface, they enjoyed the surrounding scenery, and they didn’t have to be so fearful like Lin Yun.

“This is the Three-Lives Tree? How beautiful…” Yan Tianchen couldn’t help praising as he looked at the Three-Lives Tree standing at the lake’s heart. The Three-Lives Tree gave off a dreamy beauty. When they looked down at the sapphire lake, it felt as though the lake could cleanse their hearts.

“There are legends that the Three-Lives Tree can reflect the past and future of a person. This tree grasped the dao of time and space. If the tree is satisfied with the music, it can allow someone to see their past, present, and future like a dream.” The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Ye Chen smiled.

“But it’s a pity that no one has accomplish it in the past few centuries. It’s already good enough if someone can make it bloom a flower.” Liu Ruochen of the Heavenly Dao Sect continued.
