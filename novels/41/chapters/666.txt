Chapter 667 - Divine Indigo Radiantstone

When Lin Yun returned to his seat, many people recovered from their shock and looked at him. They still couldn’t believe that Lin Yun had defeated Feng Xun without even fully unsheathing his sword.

Disciples of the Skycloud Sect would temper their spear for a decade. This was why it would shock everyone when it was unleashed. This would always result in their opponent being heavily injured or even killed.

Lin Yun’s cultivation was lower than Feng Xun’s. So logically speaking, he should be heavily injured, especially since Feng Xun’s attack was so breathtaking that it destroyed everything within its path.

However, Lin Yun was unfazed by Feng Xun’s attack. All he did was draw his sword out a little to defeat Feng Xun. When he pulled his sword out fully, Feng Xun could only tremble in fear as all of his fighting spirit disappeared. This meant that they were at two completely different levels.

On the Skycloud Sect’s pavilion, everyone’s faces were ugly as they looked at Lin Yun coldly with killing intent surging in their eyes. As the strongest sect in the Skymound City, they had never suffered such humiliation in the past.

Not only was their genius defeated by Lin Yun, but their genius was defeated so badly.

“Let’s resume the auction.” Luo Yu took a deep glance at Lin Yun before he got everyone’s attention again. As he waved his hand, nine dragon images appeared in the sky as they emitted a cold aura. In the next second, a layer of ice covered the ground that caught many people by surprise. They even started shivering from the cold.

When everyone examined the dragons carefully, the dragon images disappeared and a pellet hovered in the sky. Luo Yu smiled, “This is the Imperial Chill Pellet. It is a fourth grade pellet. If an Imperial Chill Pellet has a dragon, it can be considered a high grade pellet. This pellet has nine dragons, so it’s at the best grade. Even a pinnacle fourth grade spiritualist can only refine one or two in a decade.”

Luo Yu smiled, “The starting bid is 10,000 third grade spiritual jades, and 100,000 spiritual jades is the limit.”

The price of this pellet might be slightly lesser than Five Acute Lightning Crystals, but it was still a precious item in many people’s eyes. But no one spoke after Luo Yu introduced the item because many people were looking at Qing Ruoyou.

Everyone knew that the Indigomoon Sutra was an ice attributed cultivation technique. If Qing Ruoyou wanted it, no one would compete with her, including the four major clans in the Skymound City. But when they saw that Qing Ruoyou had maintained her silence, they knew that she probably didn’t need it.

“50,000.”

“70,000.”

“80,000.”

Very quickly, someone started to bid for the pellet, reaching the price of 80,000 third grade spiritual jades. But all of a sudden, a cold voice sounded out, “100,000. I, Chen Xiong, want it.”

When everyone saw who bidded for the pellet, they quickly began to hesitate. The Skymound City had four major clans, and the Chen Clan was one of them. They also cultivated an ice attributed cultivation technique called the Frost Monument Sutra. It wasn’t any weaker than the Indigomoon Sutra and it was similarly famous in the Thunder Prefecture.

Seeing that Chen Xiong was bidding for the item, everyone began to hesitate before giving up as they were afraid of Chen Xiong’s identity.

“Go get it for me,” said Chen Xiong as someone quickly stepped forward. This was because he had an extraordinary position in the Chen Clan.

On the stage, Luo Yu seemed rather disappointed as he was certain that this pellet could break the limit. But he never expected that everyone would give up on it the moment Chen Xiong bidded for it. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Two treasures were already gone and the next few items were similarly precious. Like everyone expected, the items were ferociously snatched up and nearly every single item broke the limit. One of the items was a treasured sword that ended up with five people breaking the limit, raising the intensity of the auction.

After Lin Yun obtained the Five Acute Lightning Crystals, he silently watched from the side when he noticed something interesting. No one among the four major clans or the Skycloud Sect dared to compete with each other. This meant that these forces had extraordinary strength in the Skymound City and that they had reached an agreement with each other.

If a force had taken a liking on an item, the other clans would casually bid before giving up. None of them chose to break the limit.

As the auction progressed, Lin Yun noted many treasures, but he didn’t need most of them. So after obtaining the Five Acute Lightning Crystals, there weren’t any treasures that attracted his attention.

Suddenly, Luo Yu took out a golden shrine engraved with ancient runes. Everyone could tell that Luo Yu was having difficulty lifting it. So one could imagine how heavy it must be, which instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

“What is it? Why is he being so mysterious?”

“That shrine seems important and it looks like it has some history. Can it be that it has a huge origin?”

“Are you stupid? The shrine isn’t up for auction. It’s the item inside that’s up for auction. I’m curious what kind of item needs to be sealed by this shrine.” Everyone discussed among each other as they looked at the shrine in Luo Yu’s hands.

After Luo Yu placed it on the stage carefully, he smiled and opened the shrine. In the next second, golden radiance came out that made the surrounding temperature hotter. The golden radiance had dazzled many people’s eyes and had also stung many people’s eyes.

Their vision was suddenly red as if there were boundless flames surging over. When Luo Yu closed the shrine, the blazing heat gradually disappeared.

“The Divine Indigo Radiantstone!”

“It’s definitely the Divine Indigo Radiantstone! No other stone can give off a strong burning sensation!”

“That must be it. I once saw a grain-sized Divine Indigo Radiantstone that could lightup the sky within a thousand mile radius.”

“No wonder it has to be contained in the shrine. If it was sealed with an ordinary box, it would probably melt the box.” Everyone exclaimed beneath the stage. Even the four major clans and Skycloud Sect couldn’t remain seated.

Looking at everyone’s expression, Luo Yu was satisfied as he said, “This is the Divine Indigo Radiantstone. The starting bid is 100,000 third grade spiritual jades, and the limit is 800,000.”

“300,000.” A genius from the Jin Clan placed a bid. Regardless if it was for refining the Divine Indigo Radiantstone or embedding it into a cosmic artifact, it could greatly boost his strength. If it was in the hands of a martial cultivator that practiced fire attributed cultivation techniques, it could instantly produce a monstrous genius that could compete with those on the inner ranking.

“400,000!” Someone quickly followed with another bid. This time, it came from a genius from the Skycloud City.

“500,000!” “600,000!” The various clans were bidding for the item as they no longer adhered to the mutual understanding they had before.

“Hehe, I’m also interested in this Divine Indigo Radiantstone. 700,000!” Chen Xiong grinned as this Divine Indigo Radiantstone also had a great use for ice attributed cultivation techniques, so much so that the usage would exceed many people’s imagination. With this item, one could bring their cultivation technique to a whole new level without having to fear chill poison harming their foundation.

The spectators’ faces began to change as they never expected that this item would cause such fierce competition between the four major clans and the Skycloud Sect. But before they could react, the bid had been pushed to 700,000, without giving anyone else the chance to bid.

“800,000!” An indifferent voice sounded out that caused many people’s faces to change as it was from Qing Ruoyou. She was nearly forgotten by everyone, but the moment she opened her mouth, she instantly became the center of attention.

Many people looked at Qing Ruoyou, but she ignored their gazes. She only had eyes for the shrine. Simultaneously, the smiles on the faces of the elites also disappeared.

“Looks like Qing Ruoyou came for this item.”

“I heard that the Indigomoon Elysium have been setting up banquets at the various cities in the Thunder Prefecture to recruit talents. I initially thought that Qing Ruoyou came for this matter, so I never expected that she came for the Divine Indigo Radiantstone.”

“Many people want it, but not many people dare to compete with her.”

“That’s for sure.”

Qing Ruoyou’s voice instantly made everyone silent before an uproar exploded. Honestly speaking, not many people needed the Divine Indigo Radiantstone. The reason being, not many of them were at the level where they could use it. Additionally, it was incompatible with their cultivation techniques.

Only a genuine monstrous genius could use it. Otherwise, it would only go to waste. As for embedding it in a cosmic artifact, this had to be done by a spiritualist in the fourth grade. A fourth grade spiritualist was equivalent to a Heavenly Soul Realm, which was rare among ordinary forces.

Lin Yun was initially not interested in it. But when he suddenly thought of something, he slowly closed his eyes. He quickly recalled a memory from a long time ago. He remembered the chill coming from Su Ziyao was terrifying when she threw up a mouthful of blood back in the Azuresky Sect. She must have been badly tormented by the chill poison back in the Azuresky Sect.

Right at this moment, Chen Xiong smiled, “Since Princess Ruoyou wants it, then I’m willing to give up on it.”

“Me too.”

“It’s rare for Princess Ruoyou to visit the Skymound City, so the Skycloud Sect naturally has to give you face.” The other forces also chose to back out from the auction without hesitation.

She was a genius on the inner ranking with a deep and unfathomable cultivation. There was also a high possibility that she might make it into the top ten in the upcoming Draconic Banquet. In addition to the fact that she had an Indigomoon Elysium elder as her master, no one dared to offend her. Since they wouldn’t offend her, they might as well gain her favor.

Qing Ruoyou looked at Luo Yu on the stage and said, “I came in a hurry, so I don’t have so many spiritual jades with me. The Indigomoon Elysium will send someone to deliver it to you in ten days. Do you have any objections to that?”

Judging from her tone, she wasn’t making a request, but giving her demands.

Luo Yu hesitated briefly before he smiled, “Sure.”

800,000 third grade spiritual jades was a sky-high price and the geniuses here could afford it because they came from the various clans in the Skymound City. So it made sense that Qing Ruoyou didn’t have so many spiritual jades on her. But Luo Yu wasn’t worried that the Indigomoon Elysium wouldn’t pay for it.

However, he was somewhat unhappy that this Divine Indigo Radiantstone couldn’t break the limit.

“Congratulations. With this stone, you can take a step further in your cultivation and you’ll have a higher chance of getting into the top ten,” smiled Xiang Tianhe. He was excited as he had facilitated this deal.

Qing Ruoyou had maintained her composure as she wasn’t surprised by this scene. After all, not many people in the Thunder Prefecture would dare to compete with her for the item she wanted, not to mention the Skymound City.

“810,000.” Right at this moment, a voice that no one had expected bidded for the item. His voice was like rumbling lightning in everyone's ears. Lin Yun opened his eyes as he said, “I’m also interested in this item.”
