Chapter 2247 - Who I Am?

When the constellation opened, a golden radiance swept out and erased all the flames. When the constellation was fully opened, there was a golden ocean with an azure lotus at the top of it.

Li Feibai basked in the radiance that the constellation gave off, and an overbearing aura swept out, piercing the clouds of the Heavenly Void with a golden beam. When he waved his hand, cracking voices came from the surroundings as the lightning pillars swiftly broke and dissipated.

“Eternal Azure Lotus!” Li Feibai waved his hand and the azure lotus began to rotate within the constellation before shooting a beam of light out, shattering the Yin-Yang diagram in the sky. In just a split second, the seal set up by the three Saint Elders was destroyed.

When Li Feibai landed on the ground, a terrifying aura swept out from him, making all the Saint Lords present feel a great pressure crushing down on them. When Li Feibai’s feet touched the ground, everyone fell to the ground from the pressure.

“The Sovereign Constellation, Eternal Azure Lotus!” Everyone was shocked. They had long heard of Sovereign Constellations before, but this was the first time they saw it.

“Sovereign Constellation!” Huang Jingyu, Heavenly Kui Saint Lord, and Liu Yunlan involuntarily landed on the ground. They knew that the Eight Imperial Clans could give birth to Sovereign Constellations, but not everyone could. So, it was close to impossible to possess a Sovereign Constellation. Most importantly, it had been hundreds, if not thousands, of years since a Sovereign Constellation appeared in the Kunlun Realm.

“Why aren’t you on your knees when seeing the sovereign?” Li Feibai roared with golden radiance shining out from his eyes. At this moment, he looked like a deity and gave off a majestic aura that no one dared to look at directly.

“Sovereign Constellation…” Lin Yun was also stunned when he saw Li Feibai using the Sovereign Constellation. He also had one but hadn’t completely brought it out before because of his cultivation. As a result, this was the first time he had felt the pressure from a Sovereign Constellation.

“He showed off again.” Lil’ Purple flung her lips aside and said, “It’s nothing that impressive when compared to Heaven Burial.”

She might have called Lin Yun a scumbag, but her heart was on Lin Yun’s side.

The moment Li Feibai said those words, he fell onto one knee. When everyone felt the pressure was alleviated, they became puzzled, with their faces changing.

But before they could comprehend what was happening, Li Feibai threw out a mouthful of blood as he clutched his chest in pain. He had a fair complexion, but his face became even paler at this moment. As Li Feibai clutched his chest, he examined his body with saint energy and instantly understood what was happening. “The Blood Poison is still around…”

He knew he was careless, thinking he had completely removed the Blood Poison. But the Blood Poison came back, even stronger than before.

“Jingyu?” Liu Yunlan looked at Huang Jingyu, whose face kept changing, and he couldn’t decide.

The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord gritted his teeth, “Jingyu, he doesn’t seem to be pretending.”

Huang Jingyu’s gaze became firm, and he nodded at the other Saint Elders. This was because not only was Li Feibai kneeling on the ground, but he couldn’t even maintain his Sovereign Constellation.

The three Saint Elders exchanged a gaze and soared to the sky. But the Saint Lords from the other forces reacted even quicker. This was because they didn’t have many reservations, and they charged at Li Feibai with their eyes shining brightly when the latter’s Sovereign Constellation dissipated. A whole flock of people were charging at Li Feibai, all wanting the Divine Blood Fruit.

“Damn it! I was careless!” Li Feibai’s face was pale. He was nervous while looking at so many people coming at him. He could only yell out in Lin Yun’s direction, “SAVE ME!”

His call for help was loud, but no one paid attention as it was already too late for him to call for help.

But in the nick of time, a sword ray shone from a faraway mountain that was bright like the sun. Under the bright light, the entire valley was lit up as a majestic sword aura flew over before anyone could turn their heads back.

Anyone who came in contact with the sword ray was sent flying away. As the sword aura spread out, those charging at Li Feibai had their bodies become stiff and couldn’t even execute their movement techniques.

When the sword ray reached and dissipated, all the Saint Lords slammed into the ground with their wails resounding. At this moment, everyone finally saw a youthful figure standing on the mountain from which the sword ray came from.

“A sword saint?!” Someone exclaimed.

“Move out!” The three Saint Lords exchanged a gaze as they charged at Li Feibai.

“Sacred Incinerating Flames!” The Heavenly Flame Sect’s Saint Elder roared with his hands raised to the sky with flames like tidal waves sweeping over.

“Heavenly Lock Thunder!” The Myriad Lightning Sect’s Saint Elder repeated what he did earlier as lightning pillars rumbled in the sky.

“Sun-Moon Suspension!” The Ming Cult’s Saint Elder pressed his palm down as a sun and a moon merged in his palm, forming a Yin-Yang diagram that increased the pressure.

Facing the three moves that were even more terrifying than before, Li Feibai’s face changed, watching as he was about to be consumed by the flames.

In the nick of time, a figure descended from the sky and swung a sword ray, slicing the incoming flames into two, sweeping past them and couldn’t harm them.

“Firefly’s Radiance!” Thirteen figures flew out from Lin Yun. The thirteen figures drew a circle before swinging his sword out. When the sword rays overlapped, they formed into a massive sword ray that severed all the lightning pillars.

“H-How is that possible?” The Myriad Lightning Sect’s Saint Elders were furious, with disbelief in their eyes.

But that wasn’t all as the Flower Burial Sword flew out from Lin Yun’s hand and swept across the sky. The sword ray was empowered with a thunderstorm that flew out, creating a hole in the Yin-Yang diagram.

That wasn’t the end as the sword ray pierced through the chest of a Ming Cult’s Saint Elder, who fell from the sky. As saint blood fell from the sky, it was followed by a scream as the Yin-Yang diagram was torn apart. The Ming Cult’s Saint Elder fell from the sky and couldn’t get back up.

“Come back!” Lin Yun swiped his fingers as the Flower Burial Sword was summoned back from the sky.

There was a Heavenly Flame Sect’s Saint Elder who wanted to launch a sneak attack, but the Flower Burial Sword flew back with an even faster speed. The Flower Burial Sword left a cut on that Saint Elder’s face as the latter rolled in mid-air, screaming in pain when he landed on the ground.

“Break!” Lin Yun swiped with his fingers as the Flower Burial Sword pierced through the air, heading towards the Myriad Lightning Sect’s Saint Elder.

The Myriad Lightning Sect’s Saint Elder had set up three lightning shields before him, but the shields were easily shattered. When the Flower Burial Sword landed on him, the huge impact sent him flying out by a few thousand meters, crashing onto a mountain that caused a cloud of dust to rise with the Saint Elder buried in the rubble when the mountain collapsed.

“A Sword Saint!” Everyone’s faces changed, with their scalps going numb as they took a deep breath. They finally confirmed that this person was a Sword Saint or it would make no sense for him to become so powerful.

“H-How is this possible?!” Li Feibai was shocked because he knew better than anyone that this person wasn’t a Sword Saint but an ‘ordinary’ Quasi-Saint!

“Damn it!” Liu Yunlan was furious as he drew his blade, unleashing multiple crimson blade rays that lit up half of the sky.

“Heavenly Flaming Purgatory!” When the blade rays descended, blade rays intertwined with the surroundings, looking like a crimson purgatory that was descending towards Lin Yun.

He took the opportunity to attack when the Flower Burial was plunged into a mountain and couldn’t return in time.

If this person took this attack head-on, he would suffer a huge loss even if he was a Sword Saint. But it was a pity that Lin Yun had predicted his attack.

A smile rose on Lin Yun’s lips beneath the mask, with a golden radiance blooming in his eyes. He released his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent. With a wave of his fingers, the Flower Burial Sword flew back even faster, drawing an arc as it aimed for Liu Yunlan’s neck.

The sword intent vibrated in Liu Yunlan’s ears, instantly placing him in a tough spot, since he would be heavily injured if he continued to swing his blade down. He might be able to inflict heavy injuries on his opponent, but it wouldn’t feel good for him either.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Gritting his teeth, Liu Yunlan swung his blade at the Flower Burial Sword. As the blade and sword clashed, the Flower Burial Sword flew away. But Lin Yun swung his fingers and the Flower Burial Sword was dragged back with a buzz.

Just like that, Lin Yun manipulated the sword from afar, forcing Liu Yunlan to get close to him. When Liu Yunlan was only one step away from him, Lin Yun’s eyes shone brightly as he held onto the Flower Burial Sword and swung it down.

Facing this horrifying attack, Liu Yunlan held his blade with both hands, but his legs trembled, blood dripping down his palms. Even the entire valley began to tremble under this sword as well.

Liu Yunlan lasted a brief moment before he could no longer hold his ground and threw out a mouthful of blood before he fell to the ground with one knee.

The surroundings fell silent with shock on everyone’s faces. This is the power of a Sword Saint?

Liu Yunlan became furious and asked, “Why does your Sword Emperor’s lineage have to keep standing in the way of our holy lands? Do you really think that no one amongst the Eastern Desolation’s holy lands can stand up to you?”

He was furious because this person had spoiled it for them multiple times. Not only did this person snatch his Blood Cloud Saint Fruit, but he even joined hands with Li Feibai, wanting to seize the Divine Blood Fruit, which was simply too much.

“The Sword Emperor’s lineage?” Lin Yun smiled beneath his mask and said, “Who told you that I’m from the Sword Emperor’s lineage?”

Liu Yunlan was briefly stunned upon hearing what Lin Yun said, and he asked, “Who the hell are you?”

“You asked me who I am?” Lin Yun removed his mask and said, “I am Flower Burial, burying both flowers and people alike!”

At this moment, Flower Burial Lin Yun had publicly returned to the Kunlun Realm.
