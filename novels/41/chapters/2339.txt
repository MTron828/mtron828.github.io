Chapter 2340 - Flower Burial's Grace

Lin Jiangxian and Xiong Tiannan were dumbfounded. After all, an Eternal Dao Fruit was a legend, and no one had heard or seen it before.

Lin Yun smiled while sharing what he saw in the Sovereign Monument.

“Ah…” Xiong Tiannan felt embarrassed that Lin Yun saw what he did in the illusory world.

This time, Lin Jiangxian believed what Lin Yun said because it was the same as what they had experienced. She thought, “I thought there was no inheritance or anything inside, but it looks like I wasn’t recognized.”

“There's no need to be bothered about that,” Lin Yun replied. “That senior must not be a swordsman. If he’s a swordsman, I believe he would have picked you.”

“If he’s a swordsman, he would’ve chosen you first,” Lin Jiangxian smiled, and what she said was the same as that senior.

“Can I take a look at it? The Eternal Dao Fruit?” Xiong Tiannan stuttered.

“Let’s leave this place first.” Qilin Mountain might be empty, but this place wasn’t safe. He gave away the Golden Dao Fruits, and the two didn’t hesitate to accept them this time.

Four hours later, they came to a ruin and found an empty area, where Lin Jiangxian set up a simple concealing spiritual array before Lin Yun took out the two crimson dao fruits.

The dao fruits emitted an ancient aura, and Xiong Tiannan could feel his soul being sucked in with his dao flowers appearing beyond his control. In a brief moment, the dao flowers gave a feeling that they were about to burst apart, scaring Xiong Tiannan into turning his gaze away.

“Holy shit!” Xiong Tiannan felt lingering fear and did not dare to look at it anymore.

Seeing this, Lin Yun stowed the Eternal Dao Fruit.

“It’s really the Eternal Dao Fruit,” Lin Jiangxian took a deep breath and couldn’t conceal her shock.

Ji Zixi curiously asked, “Can the Eternal Dao Fruit really allow someone to comprehend Eternal Dao?”

Lin Jiangxian shook her head, and said, “I’m afraid not. But I believe that it will be of help.”

“I share the same view as you,” Lin Yun raised his head to look at Lin Jiangxian. If he didn’t grasp Nirvana Dao, he wouldn’t know how tough it was to grasp an Eternal Dao. He might possess an Eternal Dao, but the process wasn’t simple. It took him many years to come this far.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Doesn’t that mean that it’s not as useful as imagined?” Ji Zixi looked disappointed since it was something Lin Yun worked hard to obtain.

Lin Jiangxian said, “It’s hard to refine a Sovereign Dao, not to mention an Eternal Dao. But I’m afraid that an Eternal Dao Fruit can save a hundred years of time, and the value is immeasurable. I can’t value it with my eyesight, but I’m afraid that even Emperors will fight over it.”

“That’s an underestimation. This thing can be considered as the treasure of a sect in the outside world,” Xiong Tiannan said. “It might not allow people to directly grasp Eternal Dao, but if it’s someone who’s one step away from grasping one like Chief Lin…”

Lin Yun and Ji Zixi curiously turned to look at Lin Jiangxian. Ji Zixi briefly pondered, then smiled, “I recall it now! Big Sister Lin had the shadows of the Five Elements Dao in your sword earlier.”

Lin Yun asked, “If you have the Eternal Dao Fruit, what are your odds of grasping the Five Elements Dao?”

“What?” Xiong Tiannan was dumbfounded. What does Lin Yun mean by that? Is he going to give away an Eternal Dao Fruit? What the hell is going on?

Xiong Tiannan didn’t know what to say when he looked at Lin Yun. This was something that he could never do, which was looking at the bigger picture.

Lin Jiangtian was briefly stunned, but then she replied, “About 50-60%. Even if I can’t comprehend it entirely, it can save me ten years of time.”

“Take one, then,” Lin Yun smiled.

Even if she was prepared, Lin Jiangxian couldn’t help being stumped with bewilderment on her face.

Xiong Tiannan coughed to attract everyone’s gaze, and he awkwardly said, “Brother Lin, I also have some attainment in an Eternal Dao.”

“Oh? What Eternal Dao is it?” Lin Yun smiled.

With no change on his face, Xiong Tiannan said, “Have you heard of this saying before, Space is sovereign, and time is king.”

“You grasped the Space and Time Daos?” Lin Yun was alarmed.

Xiong mysteriously Tiannan smiled, “Not that. Everything is nothing before nirvana!”

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling, including Ji Zixi. But Ji Zixi said nothing and continued to watch Xiong Tiannan pretend.

Xiong Tiannan sighed, “I wanted to interact with you guys as an ordinary person, but I can’t help it now. I’m the heir of nirvana, and I’m trying to find the secrets of nirvana by digging tombs around. I have some comprehension over the years, and I’m only half a step away from grasping nirvana.”

His voice sounded sincere, like a man with a story. Lin Yun might’ve believed him if he didn’t grasp Nirvana Dao as well.

“I have waited so long just for an opportunity, Brother Lin… Why don’t you give me a fair chance to compete with Chief Lin?” Xiong Tiannan asked sincerely.

Lin Yun didn’t reply to that question, but smiled, “Do you remember the stone I pointed out to you before the Sovereign Monument?”

“Of course… That was really magical. It feels like a dream thinking of it again…” Xiong Tiannan smiled.

“Since you’re being honest, I won’t lie. That rock isn’t blessed, but I left behind the aura of Nirvana Dao on it,” Lin Yun smiled.

“This…” Xiong Tiannan opened his mouth and looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. He couldn’t believe what he said earlier since it was too awkward. He laughed, “Hahaha! I’m just joking. Don’t treat it seriously! I’ll refine the Sovereign Dao Fruit!”

Looking at Xiong Tiannan as he quickly keft, Ji Zixi smiled, “He’s really interesting. I was just wondering how long he would carry on boasting…”

On the other hand, Lin Jiangxian muttered, “It’s no wonder why there wasn’t any trace in that last sword… and no wonder you dare to fight a divine disciple.”

Lin Yun smiled, “Even without Nirvana Dao, I’m not afraid of him. But the foundation of a divine disciple is too terrifying, and I might not have any advantage even if I reached the sixth-stage Saint Lord.”

After reaching the sixth-stage Saint Lord, Lin Yun could gain some advantage by relying on the two sword sutras and wouldn’t be as powerless as before in the fight with Wang Jue, not to mention that Lin Yun had even grasped Nirvana Dao. It was a pity that a deity protected Wang Jue, or he would’ve killed him.

“After undergoing the tribulation, the saint energy will undergo a transformation, and it will be empowered with the might of heavenly dao,” Lin Jiangxian explained. “It’s impressive that you can fight him while at the sixth-stage Saint Lord.”

“I see…” Lin Yun finally understood.

Lin Jiangxian smiled bitterly because Lin Yun didn’t know what that meant.

Lin Yun continued, “Have you considered the Eternal Dao Fruit?”

Lin Jiangxian was stunned, before she raised her brow, “Are you serious? You only have two Eternal Dao Fruits. What about Lady Zixi if you gave it to me?”

Ji Zixi smiled, “Big Sister Lin, you don’t have to worry about me. Speaking of which, I have to thank you for giving me the golden fortune when I didn’t ask for it.”

She was born on Divine Phoenix Mountain and had seen countless treasures since she was young. So, she would naturally consider the bigger picture, not to mention that this was Lin Yun’s decision.

“Furthermore, I have a way to comprehend an Eternal Dao. Even Big Brother Lin doesn’t know this secret, and I want to surprise him,” Ji Zixi smiled. Her innocence soon infected Lin Jiangxian into wearing a smile.

Lin Jiangxian finally decided to take the Eternal Dao Fruit, and sent a serious look at Lin Yun, “In the future, I will help you no matter what help you need from me.”

Lin Yun smiled, “That’s a bargain for me. We’re swordsmen, so we don’t have to be so polite. We both have a heart as a swordsman, so we just have to keep pressing on.”

Lin Jiangxian smiled, “I will pay you a visit to the Kunlun Realm if there’s an opportunity in the future.”

She left to find a place to refine the Eternal Dao Fruit.

“She’s going to find you…” Ji Zixi smiled, repeating what Lin Jiangxian said. She was happy to see Lin Jiangxian revering Lin Yun.

“You’re asking for a beating,” Lin Yun smiled, wanting to pat Ji Zixi’s head.

“Hehe, you can’t hit me. I’ll go refine the Golden Dao Fruits as well,” Ji Zixi laughed as she ran off, wearing a bright and innocent smile.

When the night arrived, Lin Yun took out a golden Dao Fruit. His expression became grave. He had learned his lesson today, and he had to increase his strength, whether it was helping Ji Zixi ascend the mountain or his honor as a swordsman.
