Chapter 2309 - Everything Has NirvanaVIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The holy master also mentioned eight Eternal Daos, but another Eternal Dao was the Fate Dao. Since ancient times, no one could grasp Fate Dao because no one could see through it, not to mention grasping it. Logically speaking, the eight Eternal Daos were evenly matched since they were crucial to any world. But amongst the eight Eternal Daos, the Nirvana Dao was stronger than the other seven.

To a certain degree, this was because the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity and Iris Sword Saint were the only ones who could grasp Nirvana Dao. The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity established the Divine Dragon Era and suppressed the primal beings, making the Kunlun Realm famous. Because of him, the Kunlun Realm became the center of the universe.

Not many people in the Kunlun Realm knew about this ancient secret, but that didn’t include the holy master and Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign.

As for the Iris Sword Saint, there was more information about him. In ancient times, he was the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity’s heir, killing a deity while being at the Saint Realm. Not only did he become famous in the Kunlun Realm, but throughout the universe as well. After all, Saints were no different from mere ants before deities, and Emperors were only slightly stronger ants in their eyes. But the Iris Sword Saint slew a deity while he was at the Saint Realm, which naturally caused a huge shock.

So, the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign's hands violently trembled when he learned that Lin Yun had stepped on the path to grasp Nirvana Dao. The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign suppressed his emotions, and asked, “Are you serious about that?”

The holy master nodded, “It’s true. He’ll fight with me tonight, so you can watch.”

“How will I not believe you when you put it this way? But I’m really curious and want to look at it,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign sighed.

Seeing this, the holy master smiled, “Since that’s the case, there’s something else I wish to talk about.”

“Please go on,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign said.

“The Sacred Alliance should still have a Lesser Blue Dragon Token. If what I said is the truth, can you give it to Lin Yun and give him a chance?” The holy master smiled, revealing his motive.

“The Lesser Blue Dragon Token?” The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign pondered, then said, “There aren’t many Lesser Blue Dragon Saint Tokens in the Kunlun Realm, at least no more than three.”

“Lin Yun is worth it,” the holy master said.

“Is he willing?” The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign said with uncertainty. “Even if I give it to him, it’s uncertain if he will be willing now.”

“We can let him choose. We won’t force him, and it will depend on himself,” the holy master said.

“Okay.”

As time passed, five days passed in the blink of an eye. Then again, it had been four to five months for Lin Yun since he used the divine dragon saint liquid to speed up time. In this period, he would fight the holy master at night and seclude himself beneath the Phoenix Tree during the day.

The next morning, the Astral River Saint Sovereign came with an unimaginable amount of resources as a gift. With so many resources, Lin Yun’s cultivation came to the fourth-stage Saint Lord.

He had received the treatment of a divine son, making Lin Yun feel like he was dreaming. Lin Yun even suspected that the Divine Phoenix Mountain wanted to clear out all of their resources. Aside from that, he noticed that the holy master’s attitude had changed after he used the Nirvana Sword Art.

They might be sparring, but it was the holy master who was trying to guide him in his sword technique. This allowed Lin Yun’s comprehension of sword dao to transform. Even cultivating for ten years couldn’t be compared to the guidance in this period.

Lin Yun could barely break that barrier layer at the beginning when he used Nirvana of the Beginning. But the rate of success gradually grew to 100%, and he could unleash it every time.

At this moment, Lin Yun was sitting beneath the Phoenix Tree to cultivate with three dao flowers behind him, representing Sword Dao, Thunder Dao, and Wind Dao.

The flower representing Sword Dao was enveloped with thousands of threads, while the Thunder and Wind Daos were fewer in comparison. But that wasn’t the key. A flower bud was slowly forming aside from the three flowers.

Just when Lin Yun was looking around, blurred afterimages began to perform the Nirvana Sword Art. Time and space began to intertwine as the sword technique changed, with afterimages overlapping. That was a sign that the fourth dao flower was starting to form, releasing a mysterious and ancient aura.

No one knew how much time had passed before a huge commotion came from beneath the Phoenix Tree, causing the radiance released by the Phoenix Tree to shatter.

Lil’ Purple opened her eyes beneath the waterfall and squinted when they saw this scene. She knew Lin Yun succeeded. The fourth dao flower was finally formed, representing Nirvana Dao.

A bell rang and echoed between heaven and earth as the petals of the flower representing Nirvana Dao began to open up, releasing a seven-colored radiance. Under the divine radiance, Lin Yun opened his eyes with his Azure Saint Cloth fluttering in the wind.

Lin Yun opened his hand as a flower descended on his palm, letting him heave a sigh in relief with all his emotions unleashed. He had waited a long time for this moment, from when he learned that the Iris Sword Saint slew a deity with Nirvana Dao, his meeting with the Iris Sword Saint in the God Burial Mountain Range, which allowed him to comprehend the Nirvana Sword Art, to becoming a Saint in the Heavenly Void and practicing the Nirvana Sword Art countless times with the Scarlet Radiance Saint Lord.

By the time he finally comprehended Nirvana Dao, Lin Yun didn’t rejoice, but was terrifyingly calm instead.

“Congratulations!” Lil’ Purple came before Lin Yun with joy on her face.

Lin Yun turned to look at Lil’ Purple, and they both smiled. They experienced countless life and deaths together, reaching a high rapport. Looking at each other, they instantly knew what each other was thinking.

Lin Yun opened his palm, allowing the dao flower to land on his palm. He smiled, “I have just entered the threshold, and I’m still far from grasping it completely.”

“There’s no need to rush. You can try and find the Nirvana Seal left behind by the Iris Sword Saint now. I know he won’t die without any preparations,” Lil’ Purple said.

She didn’t know much about Nirvana Dao but understood the Iris Sword Saint’s personality well. Since he had left behind the Nirvana Seal, he must have included the method to cultivate Nirvana Dao in it. When she finished speaking, a dazzling radiance came from the Sword Mound’s direction in the Iris Secret Realm.

“Over there!” Lin Yun rushed over to the Sword Mound. The Sword Mound looked more like a heavily damaged vault with many damaged weapons lying on the ground. He had only visited this place once and didn’t find any valuable treasures in his search since the treasures were all damaged from that ancient battle. Or perhaps all the treasures were taken away by the Iris Sword Saint.

As Lin Yun searched, he came to where the light was coming from and an ancient seal appeared before Lin Yun. Looking at the Nirvana Seal, Lin Yun felt furious and helpless at the same time because back then he couldn’t find it. But after grasping Nirvana Dao, the Nirvana Seal immediately appeared before him.

“Iris Sword Saint, you must’ve done this on purpose, right?” Lin Yun smiled. He stepped forward and came in contact with the Nirvana Seal, which then exploded.

He immediately fell into a weird state with the Iris Sword Saint’s voice beside his ears, “Everything in the world has nirvana, and nirvana has several stages. The Time-Space Nirvana, Samsara Nirvana, Four Seasons Nirvana, Heaven-Earth Nirvana, Six Path Nirvana. Everything that loses nirvana will collapse, and grasping nirvana means grasping everything…

“Time-Space Nirvana is beginning. Time and space are powerful but require nirvana as the foundation. If nirvana wasn’t around, time and space would be like fishes in the air.

“Life and death are two extremes, but when you grasp the Samsara Nirvana, you can control the two profundities.

“As for the four seasons, the breeze in spring is gentle, the summer is blazing hot, the autumn is desolate, and winter means the end of life. Each contain different profundities: the breeze of spring, fallen leaves of autumn, or the white blizzard… all in a single thought…

“Yin-Yang as heaven and five elements as the world. Heaven and earth represent a world, and there is nirvana. When you see Heaven-Earth Nirvana, you will grasp the power of the world. You can hear the world’s heartbeat and use everything in the world.

“The six daos represented the Heavenly Path, Mortal Path, Beast Path, Asura Path, Hell Path, and Ghost Path. When you grasp the Six Path Nirvana, you can restart the world…”

“So, where have you reached?” Lin Yun saw a gaze and a roar that made him come to his senses.

“Are you alright? What did you see? Did the Iris Sword Saint dig a pit for you again? It looks like I have to give him a beating when I see him!” Lil’ Purple said furiously.

Lin Yun clutched his chest, and smiled, “I’m fine. He taught me something, and I roughly know how to cultivate Nirvana Dao now.”

“That doesn’t look like teaching you. Your face was terrifyingly pale earlier, and you were muttering to yourself so much that it frightened me,” Lil’ Purple said in a worried tone.

“You might not be able to defeat him even if you see him,” Lin Yun smiled, but he had suffered a huge shock. After hearing what the Iris Sword Saint said earlier, he finally knew how the Iris Sword Saint managed to slay a deity as a Saint.
