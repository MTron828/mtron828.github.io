Chapter 1633 - Let's Go Together!

Qin Tian’s domineering words left everyone dumbfounded as they looked at that headless corpse lying on the ground. Anyone who could come here was an elite who entered the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and ordinary people wouldn’t be able to find this place. Some knew about the saint palace’s location but didn’t have the guts to come.

The face of the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s Xiao Kui changed, and he raised his head to look at Qin Tian. Just when he wanted to say something, a gaze was directed at him, coming from Qin Tian.

Qin Tian seemingly wanted to say something: I’m saying that to everyone here, and that naturally includes the Heavenly Blade Pavilion. Xiao Kui, think carefully before opening that mouth of yours!

As immense pressure came crashing down on Xiao Kui, making Xiao Kui unable to say anything because Qin Tian’s killing intent was too terrifying. Xiao Kui could feel a chill running down his spine from his killing intent. His face was pale, with his right hand trembling, but he didn’t dare to look directly at Qin Tian.

“Let’s start with you guys. The Heavenly Blade Pavilion can leave now!” Qin Tian said.

“What gives!”

“Senior Brother, let’s just fight them! The Profound Sky Sect is too much!” The disciples of the Heavenly Blade Pavilion flew into a rage because Qin Tian didn’t give them any face and publicly humiliated them.

“What gives? Is my name ‘Qin Tian’ not enough?” Qin Tian hovered in the air and reached out at Xiao Kui.

Just when Xiao Kui drew his blade out by an inch, an invisible hand grabbed his throat and slowly lifted him in the air. His blade soon fell to the ground. His face was distorted with pain, and he grabbed at his throat, trying to break free from something. But no matter how he struggled, he couldn’t break free from that invisible hand.

“What the hell is going on?” Everyone was shocked, including everyone from the Heavenly Blade Pavilion.

Everyone from the Sword Sect could feel a chill run down their spines. When they looked at Mu Xueqin and others, they saw that they were also shocked.

“Leave! We’ll leave immediately!” Xiao Kui said with great difficulty. When he was done speaking, he was thrown to the ground by Qin Tian, and it took him great difficulty to get back on his feet; this also struck a great blow to the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s morale.

“Interesting…” Lin Yun noticed that this was somewhat similar to his Azure Dragon Grasp. That gaze that blew apart someone’s head earlier was similar to his Divine Dragon Eyes, making Lin Yun fall into deep thoughts. Could it be that Qin Tian has also practiced the martial techniques of the Dragon Clan?

There was a huge possibility because Tian Xuanzi might possess the Dragon Clan’s bloodline, which meant that he had a complicated relationship with the Divine Dragon Empire.

“Get lost!” Qin Tian roared. This embarrassed the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s disciples, but there was nothing they could do. They could only leave. It didn’t take long for them to leave this place.

“Anyone still unconvinced?” Qin Tian swept his gaze around. He knew that he had to intimidate everyone before he could monopolize all the benefits in the Blue Dragon Saint Palace. He would just kill anyone who wasn’t convinced, and he didn’t have to waste time talking to them. The Ancient Barren Battlefield didn’t have any rules. Since he had the heart to be invincible, he had nothing to fear.

Under Qin Tian’s gaze, the Heavenly Note Sect, Profound Valley, and the Thunder Sect left with no one daring to stay behind.

“Tian Xuanzi’s disciple, how mighty!” An unconvinced voice resounded.

“Who’s there?! Come out!” Liu Xu roared, and the other Profound Sky Sect’s disciples immediately spread out to search for that person who had spoken earlier.

“No need to look for me because I’m here.” A person flew out. This person looked extraordinary, and his pupils were filled with mockery.

“Heavenly Flame Sect’s Wang Tao?” Lin Yun and Gu Ruochen exchanged a glance. They were surprised that the inner disciples of the holy land would stand out at this moment to face Qin Tian head-on.

“Who is he?”

“The Sword Sect hasn’t even come out, and yet he dares to stand out against the Profound Sky Sect?”

“Isn’t he afraid of death?” Everyone was shocked. Even the Heavenly Blade Pavilion, Heavenly Note Sect, Profound Valley, and the Thunder Sect’s disciples stopped and turned around.

Qin Tian didn’t say anything, but Zhang Yuan whispered into his ears, telling him Wang Tao’s origins. Then, Qin Tian looked at Wang Tao with a playful gaze, “Disciple of the Heavenly Flame Sect?”

“That’s right. Heavenly Flame Sect’s inner disciple, Wang Tao, is here. Others might fear you, but not me. I don’t care what you’re planning, but don’t you try to command me. You’re still not qualified to do so!” Wang Tao looked at Qin Tian with disdain.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Heavenly Flame Sect? Isn’t that a holy land?”

“Oh my god! That means he’s a disciple of a holy land!”

“The Radiant Sword Saint is dying, so the holy land’s disciples are publicly standing out now.”

“Isn’t that good? If he can deal with Qin Tian, we’ll have the opportunity to enter the Blue Dragon Saint Palace!” Everyone who began to lose hope finally had flames of hope blazing in their pupils.

“Since you know my origin, do I qualify to enter the Blue Dragon Saint Palace now?” Wang Tao didn’t conceal his objective at all. He came to the Ancient Barren Battlefield to seek opportunities in the Blue Dragon Saint Palace. It was fine if Qin Tian didn’t come out to stop him. But if Qin Tian dared to stop him, he couldn’t be blamed for what he would do.

“I don’t wish to repeat myself a third time.” Qin Tian replied indifferently.

Wang Tao looked confident, but Qin Tian didn’t place him in his eyes at all. When he was done, it instantly made Wang Tao’s face change. With a darkened face, Wang Tao disappeared, “Since that’s the case, let me see how capable you are, then!”

A colossal collision soon occurred, and Liu Xu stopped his punch. After Liu Xu stopped Wang Tao’s punch, he indifferently said, “You’re still not qualified to fight my senior brother.”

“You’re courting death!” Wang Tao immediately dashed forth. The two swiftly fought in mid-air, and soon exchanged over ten-odd moves in the blink of an eye.

A blazing white tiger appeared behind Wang Tao, while a silver altar appeared behind Liu Xu. On that silver altar, there was a revolving sun enveloped in flames. The shockwave from their fight made many people throw out blood and faint in just a split second.

“Get lost!” Wang Tao’s aura suddenly changed. When crimson beams shot out from his pupils, the flaming white tiger behind him instantly grew ten-fold.

This caused fine cracks in the sun behind Liu Xu, with blood dripping from Liu Xu’s lips. He was then sent a thousand meters back.

Many of Profound Sky Sect’s disciples were caught by surprise by this. When Liu Xu slammed into them, they were heavily injured. Some disciples were even immediately killed by the impact.

“Holy Land’s Wang Tao is here! Who dares to stop me!” Wang Tao roared after he injured Liu Xu. His aura had reached a terrifying height. He was like a slumbering ancient beast that had awakened at this moment, and was enveloped in a ferocious aura.

“Hahaha!”

“Is that the best the Profound Sky Sect can do?” Seeing this, three more holy land geniuses laughed as they stood out from the crowd.

“Holy Land’s Chen Yu wishes to see how capable Brother Qin is!”

“Holy Land’s Bai Feng wishes to see how capable Brother Qin is!”

“Holy Land’s Ceng Qing wishes to see how capable Brother Qin is!”

The three soared to the sky and soon arrived beside Wang Tao, emitting terrifying auras. Their auras managed to suppress the Profound Sky Sect’s momentum for a moment, and this sudden change of events caught everyone by surprise.

This was still the first time the holy lands’ geniuses arrogantly stood out in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. It wasn’t that there weren’t any holy land geniuses who entered the Ancient Barren Battlefield in the past, but this was the first time they dared to keep such a high profile.

Everyone’s gazes fell onto Qin Tian, wanting to see how he would react. If Qin Tian was forced to step back, his prestige would suffer a huge blow today.

He knew that the holy lands’ geniuses had no good intentions, but this development wasn’t bad.

Qin Tian looked at the four holy land geniuses with a playful smile and coldly said, “You think I didn’t discover you guys before? It’s good that you guys came out. Now I don’t have to look for you individually. Who the hell do you guys think you are? The Ancient Barren Domain is under the control of my master!”

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren!” The Profound Sky Sect’s disciples roared, their morale rising.

“Don’t bother wasting time. Let’s go at them together!” Qin Tian said.

This instantly made the four holy lands’ geniuses inwardly cuss because Qin Tian was too arrogant.

“You’re not coming? I’m coming, then!” Qin Tian laughed and charged toward Wang Tao. He turned into a crimson streak appearing before Wang Tao with his hand reaching out.

Qin Tian’s killing intent soared to the sky, with dragon roars echoing across the horizon as a golden divine dragon appeared within the clouds. His hand was like a dragon claw that pressed down on Wang Tao.

“Go!” The other three holy land geniuses quickly made a move with their faces changing.

“Get lost!” Qin Tian waved his left hand, forcing the three to step back before a dragon tail lashed at the three of them like a whip.

This instantly sent those three flying back before they fell to the ground. As for Wang Tao, his flaming white tiger merely lasted for a split second before it was torn apart by the dragon claw, and he was pressed down to the ground.

This left Wang Tao surprised because even though he was the inner disciple of a holy land, he couldn’t even withstand one attack from Qin Tian? Just when he was about to execute all his trump cards and no longer held back, he saw mockery flashing through Qin Tian’s pupils.

Qin Tian swiftly lashed out two kicks, shattering Wang Tao’s knees and forcing him to the ground.

“An inner disciple’s holy land like you dares to act with such impudence before me? You’re courting death!” After forcing Wang Tao onto his knees, Qin Tian still didn’t let him go and slapped Wang Tao on his face, sending Wang Tao flying away with blood dripping from his lips.

“My Profound Sky Sect will dominate the Ancient Barren Domain sooner or later and become a holy land. Don’t think you have a high position just because you’re the inner disciple of a holy land. I won’t hesitate to take your life if you dare to push it!” Qin Tian said coldly.

As boundless killing intent swept out from Qin Tian, he raised his head and forced the four holy land disciples to take several steps back.

At this moment, everyone couldn’t help thinking of the word ‘invincible’ when they looked at Qin Tian.

“Senior Brother Qin is invincible!”

“Senior Brother Qin is invincible!” The Profound Sky Sect’s disciples roared with excitement.
