Chapter 2107: Sword God’s Smile (2)

Ten moves later, the Bloodclothed Venerable fused with the Bloodfire Demon Flower, and the few hundred vines formed into a massive whip. When the whip flew out, the nine dragons wailed and collapsed on the ground. This made Young Master Wushuang throw out a mouthful of blood, with the aura he gave off plummeting.

“How is this possible?” Young Master Wushuang raised his head and looked at the Bloodclothed Venerable with disbelief.

“Haha. Do you want to let me have three moves with only this much strength? You’re a joke!” The Bloodclothed Venerable laughed, before she charged forth.

As the two exchanged another three moves, Young Master Wushuang failed to take a move and was forced to retreat, throwing out a mouthful of blood.

Three moves later, Young Master Wushuang clashed with the wall, and the pain made him grimace his teeth, and even briefly lost control of his Soaring Dragon Art.

Taking this opportunity, the Bloodclothed Venerable opened her mouth, and a bizarre scene occurred. The Bloodfire Demon Flower flew out of her body. The petals looked like a demonic beast that was opening its mouth. The Bloodfire Demon Flower looked like a man-eating flower while devouring the nine dragons, chewing the nine dragons and finally closing the petals. Just like that, the nine dragons were devoured by her. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“How delicious!” The Bloodclothed Venerable’s face was radiant, and her face became rosy, with her aura increasing. On the other hand, Young Master Wushuang became weak, and he couldn’t even maintain his footing.

This instantly caused everyone’s faces to change. The Bloodclothed Venerable seemed to have devoured Young Master Wushuang’s cultivation, and her cultivation increased. This scene made everyone shudder.

Lin Yun instantly knew that the Bloodclothed Venerable had used this method to strengthen herself during this period.

“You dare call yourself a young master? Only one person in the Eastern Desolation can call himself that: Young Master Flower Burial! I have no idea how to comment on your shamelessness,” Bloodclothed Venerable mocked.

All the cultivators from the Eastern Desolation were afraid of her, and even Bai Yunfeng was shocked. He didn’t expect Bloodclothed Venerable to be so strong. Did she conceal her strength when I fought Zhao Tianyu back then?

Bai Qingyu was also shocked as she exclaimed, “Isn’t she a little too strong? Did she grasp the devour dao?”

Lin Yun shook his head and said, “She’s a Bloodfire Demon Flower, so she should not have grasped the devour dao. Otherwise, Young Master Wushuang should’ve died, so this must be her bloodline talent.”

“L-Let me go…” The Bloodclothed Venerable grabbed Young Master Wushuang and stepped on him, making the latter unable to move. But the Bloodclothed Venerable looked provocatively at Bai Yunfeng and Ji Haoyu. She said, “It’s time for you two to make a move now. After all, these garbage are useless no matter how many you send out.”

Bai Yunfeng and Ji Haoyu were placed in a difficult position. They could naturally defeat the Bloodclothed Venerable if they made a move, but Zhao Tianyu was still around. So if they were forced to make a move by the Bloodclothed Venerable, they wouldn’t be able to compete for the Golden Lotus Flametree.

“Haha! You two have high airs. It looks like it’s hard to find an opponent for me to spar with. Ye Qingtian, come out!” The Bloodclothed Venerable turned to look at Lin Yun. She smiled, “I heard that you’ve defeated Feng Shaoyu at the Sword Assembly and killed a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase. Why aren’t you saying anything now? Didn’t you claim to be a genius swordsman?”

The other venerables beside Zhao Tianyu also turned to look at Lin Yun. But they couldn’t tell anything special about him besides being handsome. They didn’t know why the divine son paid so much attention to this person.

“Forget it. I’m afraid that you’re scared silly. So let me make a move, then!” The Bloodclothed Venerable didn’t wait for Lin Yun’s reply and made a move with crimson flames gushing out of her body.

Everyone present could feel a blazing aura gushing out from the Bloodclothed Venerable. Sensing the flames, cracks began to appear on the ground, and many people couldn’t resist the scorching aura even after using their saint aura.

At this moment, everyone finally discovered that the Bloodclothed Venerable had held back in her fight with Xiao Yi and Young Master Wushuang.

This made Bai Yunfeng frown with a peculiar light flashing within his eyes. He could sense that something wasn’t right. Although the Bloodclothed Venerable was brutal with her means earlier, she didn’t release any murderous intent. But she didn’t hold back when she was making a move against Ye Qingtian.

When Bai Yunfeng turned to look at Zhao Tianyu, he noticed that the latter also opened his eyes to look at Lin Yun.

At this moment, Bai Yunfeng knew that the Bloodclothed Venerable fought Xiao Yi and Young Master Wushuang on purpose. It was already too late for him to stop her.

The Bloodclothed Venerable was swift while being enveloped in crimson flames and petals flying out from her. Countless vines combined into a claw that fused with her right hand, before she locked onto Lin Yun.

Everything happened too quickly, and everyone could already imagine the scene of Ye Qingtian being ripped apart.

But then, Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword, and his aura drastically changed. His aura suddenly became sharp, like a young Sword Immortal.

When Lin Yun drew the sword out by half an inch, all the swordsmen could sense that their swords were trembling beyond their control. At the same time, a silver radiance swept out. Lin Yun had executed the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, and a pseudo-sword domain appeared around him.

As a silver sword radiance swept out, this entire region became filled with an invisible sword intent, and the Bloodclothed Venerable was knocked back by this aura alone.

At the same time, a powerful sword aura swept out, catching many cultivators by surprise, before they were sent flying away under the shockwave. When Lin Yun completely drew out the Flower Burial Sword, he shook his wrist, and a powerful sword radiance exploded, releasing a dazzling light.

The next second, the sword pierced through Bloodclothed Venerable’s palm, tearing her right arm apart.

When all the cultivators from the Eastern Desolation looked at themselves, they were so shocked that it felt suffocating to breathe.

They began to wonder what kind of monster Ye Qingtian was to defeat the Bloodclothed Venerable with one sword.

“This…” Bai Yunfeng was completely dumbfounded and was prepared to save Ye Qingtian. He found this inconceivable and couldn’t believe the scene before him. But he wasn’t the only one because everyone from the six holy lands couldn’t believe this scene.

Ye Qingtian had defeated the Bloodclothed Venerable with one sword. Was this the same Ye Qingtian who failed in his breakthrough to the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage?

Who said that Ye Qingtian has lost his fangs? That fellow is clearly the reincarnation of the Sword God, and he is invincible against those of the same generation!
