Chapter 1829 - Awkward

Lin Yun stomped his foot on the ground and soared to the sky. The Sword Heart was no longer that invincible when facing such a powerful enemy because the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was too fast. When a demonic aura swept out, it had already suppressed his Sword Heart.

On the ground, the tortoiseshell was like a rock slowly fleeing away.

With no choice, Lin Yun could only bring out his full strength and deal with the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. After several exchanges, this made Lin Yun know the huge gap between them. If this Silver-Eyed Demonspirit didn’t open its third eye, he might have still been able to put up a fight. But after the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit opened its third eye, this made it an invincible existence in the Heavenly Thunder Palace.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Just when Lin Yun was about to lose his ground, flute music suddenly echoed that sounded like an ancient rhythm, like a phoenix spreading its wings, creating ripples in the surroundings under the soundwaves.

The flute sounded majestic, like the descent of a saint with an invincible momentum. This was the Great Saint Tune.

As crimson clouds covered the sky under the flute melody, a vermilion bird shrouded in a sacred aura dashed over along with the melody. The flames on the vermilion bird could curb the demonic aura while charging towards the demonspirit under the control of the melody.

When Lin Yun turned around, he saw Mei Zihua flying over, stepping on a rainbow, and blowing his flute. At this moment, Mei Zihua looked like a celestial, creating such an earth-shattering phenomenon through his music. A song later, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was sent flying away by the vermilion bird, covering it with scorching wounds.

Mei Zihua lowered his flute and smiled, “Lin Xiao, do you remember what I said previously? With me around, no one can kill you in the Heavenly Thunder Palace.”

But Lin Yun wore a grave expression and was afraid that Mei Zihua would continue bragging. He said, “Let’s get going. The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit isn’t as simple as you think.”

“Don’t worry about it. I have my ways to deal with it.” Mei Zihua smiled confidently, and his confidence made Lin Yun shocked.

The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit charged over once more, and under the demonic radiance from its third eye, it was gradually healing from its injuries. This naturally made Lin Yun’s heart skip a beat, but Mei Zihua was calm as he said, “Brother Lin, don’t worry, and just watch me!”

He was confident in himself, and showed no signs of backing away after seeing the demonspirit charging over. But he didn’t play the flute nor use his Great Saint Tune. But when the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was two thousand meters close to him, Mei Zihua finally moved. He waved his hand and an ancient Thunder Black Tortoise’s aura came from his back.

As countless silver thunderbolts converged, multiple saint runes appeared before creating a massive Black Tortoise painting. At the same time, Mei Zihua’s aura began to rise and instantly reached a horrifying height.

Did Mei Zihua also possess the Black Tortoise’s bloodline? Lin Yun instantly squinted his pupils with shock in the depths of his pupils.

“Come!” Mei Zihua waved his hand as rings of shackles began to spread out from his wrist before forming into nine silver chains engraved with saint runes. The chains were swift and instantly bound onto the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, instantly causing the demonspirit to let out a scream with its demonic radiance swiftly dissolved.

“What power!” Lin Yun was shocked because this Silver-Eyed Demonspirit seemed to be terrified of the silver chains. But there was an endless flow of silver energy pouring into the silver chains from the Black Tortoise phenomenon.

After a while, lightning flames ignited on the silver chains that made the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit let out an even louder scream. This instantly made the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s body shrivel up, and the demonic aura on its body swiftly dissolved in the form of black miasma.

This immediately brought joy to Lin Yun’s face, and he knew Mei Zihua probably went to obtain this treasure during the time he was missing. Did that mean he found it at the bottom of the pool? Wasn’t he a little too fortunate?

“Brother, I can’t hold on any longer. Quick, give him a sword on its forehead!” Mei Zihua immediately wore a strained expression with his face becoming pale. But the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was running amok, dragging its silver chains and trying to pull Mei Zihua over. This naturally frightened Mei Zihua and he quickly asked for help.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and didn’t dare to be careless. He drew the Flower Burial Sword and unleashed the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. When he directed it with his fingers, he activated the Glorymetal Spirits in his sword before controlling it and plunging it into the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s forehead.

Once the demonic radiance coming from the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was extinguished, it threw out a mouthful of blood with its demonic aura declining.

“Lin Xiao, don’t kill it!” Gu Jun yelled, coming out of the tortoiseshell.

When Lin Yun raised his head, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s pupils gradually recovered their clarity, and no longer had any demonic radiance. Now, it looks like an ordinary cultivator. Did that mean he killed the wrong person?

“Come back!” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked. The Flower Burial Sword flew into the sheath as Lin Yun and Gu Jun both appeared beside the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. Mei Zihua also recalled the silver shackles, but his face was terrifyingly pale.

“I never expect that I’d see a descendant of my clan after a hundred thousand years.” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit raised its head to look at Gu Jun, revealing a gratified and amicable expression.

This naturally made Lin Yun shocked, and he began to wonder what was going on.

“This is a secret technique of the Demonspirit Clan, Demon Seeding. It can convert another race into a demonspirit, and they will be enslaved for life.” Seeing Lin Yun’s doubt, the silver-clothed elder explained with a smile. “But this sort of method is time exhausting, and it will generally be used on those who are at the pinnacle of the Saint Realm.”

“Then, earlier…” Lin Yun said guiltily.

“You don’t have to feel guilty, and I apologize for that. Even if you don’t kill me, I won’t live for long. I would rather die than live in this manner. You have helped me to be free, and I should thank you for it. Then again, that includes the young friend who used the Black Thunder Chains.”

Lin Yun nodded his head, but he still couldn’t help feeling a little sad.

“How are the descendants of my clan fairing?” The silver-robed elder asked, looking at Gu Jun.

But Gu Jun let out a sigh and explained, “All the descendants of the Black Tortoise Clan are at the Eastern Sea. The thunder lineage might not be extinct, but it’s withering. I’m here for the Black Thunder Saint Canon. Senior, do you know where it is located?”

“The Black Thunder Saint Canon…” The silver-robed elder recalled, and he said, “Back then, I resisted with all I could but I still couldn’t stop the destruction of the heavenly palace. If the Black Thunder Saint Canon hasn’t been taken away, it should be in the Black Thunder Saint Pool.”

“The Black Thunder Saint Pool?” Gu Jun asked as he fell into deep thought.

“It should still be around. The Black Thunder Saint Pool is located in the depths of the Black Thunder Saint Palace, the Grand Worship Ground.” The silver-robed elder said. He then briefly paused before he asked, “Is this young lad also a descendant of the Black Tortoise Clan?”

“He’s not, but the Black Tortoise Secret Key to the Demigod Wine Cellar should be with him.” Gu Jun said.

The Demigod Wine Cellar? Lin Yun pondered, but he put aside his doubts for now and said, “Senior, do you know if there are any more Silver-Eyed Demonspirit in the Black Thunder Saint Palace?”

“There are.” The silver-robed elder wore a painful expression, and continued, “There are at least three. They have all lost their consciousness, and they have been completely converted to Silver-Eyed Demonspirits. I hid under the lightning pool and relied on the suppression of the Black Thunder Chains to suppress myself and barely retain a wisp of consciousness, but that’s all to it.”

As he spoke, the silver-robed elder’s body slowly began to dissipate. This scene made Gu Jun’s face painful and his eyes became watery.

“Don’t feel sad for me. Since there are still descendants of our clan around, I believe my old brothers who died in the battle at least showed some value.” The silver-robed elder comforted, before he suddenly dispersed. When he dispersed, there were thirty-six silver Black Tortoise Cores hovering in the air, and each of them was shining brightly, emitting a terrifying saint radiance.

With a painful expression, Gu Jun sobbed, “You can have them.”

“I don’t think it’s appropriate.” Lin Yun naturally wanted them, but they were the remains of the Black Tortoise Clan. Since Gu Jun possessed the Black Tortoise Clan’s bloodline, Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t compete with him.

“Take them. Do you think I have the courage to refine these Black Tortoise Cores?” Gu Jun sighed. It might not feel much to others, but these Black Tortoise Cores were no different from the blood and flesh of his relatives to him. So how could he possibly refine them?

If the Thunder Black Tortoise’s lineage was prosperous, it could be regarded as an inheritance for them. But Gu Jun had personally witnessed the death of the silver-robed elder, and refining these Black Tortoise Cores was no different from consuming the blood and flesh of his relatives.

“Give me some time.” Gu Jun said as he sat on the ground. But when Lin Yun casually threw a jar of wine over, the old man took a gulp before he said, “I don’t want this. Give me a jar of Dragon Clan’s wine.”

This made Lin Yun surprised, and he wondered if he was genuinely sad. But he still handed a jar of wine over and said, “This is the last jar I have.”

That was really the last jar of Dragon Clan’s wine. Even though he had been sparingly drinking them, most of them were drunk by the old man. He had long finished the Millennium Flame, and he had no more Dragon Clan’s wine now.

As Gu Jun gulped down the wine, he took a deep breath before saying, “This is great. Look at how stingy you are. You’ll have an eye-opening experience later when we’re in the Demigod Wine Cellar.”

Lin Yun knew that Gu Jun was bragging again, but he concentrated on collecting the saint-grade Black Tortoise Cores.

Right at this moment, a painful groan resounded. When Lin Yun and Gu Jun turned around, they saw Mei Zihua shaking his dangling hand, and he awkwardly said, “This arm seems to be crippled.”

He did restrict the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit earlier, but he didn’t expect that he would have to pay such a great price, and his face was ugly.
