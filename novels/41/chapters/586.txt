Chapter 587 - The Loser—Scram

The Flamecloud Mountain Range was filled with demonic beasts, but those demonic beasts couldn’t pose a threat to the Heavenly Province Academy’s party. So much so that Tang Yu didn’t even need to act since the threat could be easily resolved by Mo Ling and Zhang Yuan.

Since Mu Chen and the other inner disciples rarely left the Heavenly Sword Sect, they were filled with excitement for this trip. The moment there was an opportunity for them to perform, they would charge forward without a second thought. On the contrary, Lin Yun wasn’t interested. This wasn’t his first time traveling, so he wouldn’t act unless there was a need.

The group’s journey in the mountain range gradually slowed down as they traveled further. Thunderclouds covered the sky and the environment was harsh. Simultaneously, the demonic beasts they ran into also gradually became even more terrifying. Even the Yin-Yang stage elders gradually started to take action. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

At the same time, this trip had widened Lin Yun’s scope. This was the first time he witnessed the power of a Yin-Yang stage expert and so many powerful demonic beasts. But the demonic beasts were easily dealt with by the Yin-Yang stage elders.

The Violet Palace Realm was divided into three stages, the Yin, Yang, and Yin-Yang stages. Right now, Lin Yun was in the pinnacle Yin stage. He had already come in contact with the border of the Yang stage, but he still had a long way to go to the Yin-Yang stage.

Legend had it that upon reaching the Yin-Yang stage, the cultivator’s martial soul would undergo a transformation and become stronger. Upon reaching that stage, the transformation of the martial soul was important as the cultivation of martial souls was crucial if one could make a breakthrough into the Heavenly Soul Realm.

Five days later, the party finally met an obstruction in the Flamecloud Mountain Range. Several Yin-Yang stage elders attacked, but even that lineup wasn’t enough. If they forcibly attacked, then they might even endanger their lives.

In the end, Tang Yu acted and killed that demonic beast quickly. This was Lin Yun’s first time seeing a Heavenly Soul Realm expert kill a powerful enemy and he was shocked by the power. The Yin-Yang stage elders were powerful, but Lin Yun was confident that he could flee from them if it came down to it.

However, the same couldn’t be said if he had to deal with a Heavenly Soul Realm expert. The sky had already turned dark when Tang Yu said, “Let’s rest for the day. We can continue our journey tomorrow. We're not far from the Withernorth Sea now.”

No one had any objections since they didn’t get a break ever since they entered the Flamecloud Mountain Range. Even Lin Yun felt somewhat exhausted. Furthermore, this place was perfect to use as their camp for the day.

Since this place was an overlord demonic beast’s territory, it was naturally safe from other demonic beasts. Additionally, the spiritual energy was very dense, which would allow them to recover.

Mu Chen stepped forward, “Elder Tang, we’re already late. Won’t the others get a leg up on us if we stop now?”

Mu Chen’s tone was filled with reverence for Tang Yu, especially after witnessing Tang Yu’s strength.

Tang Yu smiled, “Don’t worry about it. The Withernorth Sea is covered in a sandstorm and there are only a few days every month when the sandstorm is calm enough for humans to enter. Even if those people aren’t afraid of death, they won’t be able to find the ancient tomb so quickly.”

“Is there something unusual about the Withernorth Sea?” asked Mu Chen.

“You’ll see. The Withernorth Sea isn’t called a sea for nothing. The desert changes often from the sand’s flow. Sometimes, you won’t even know where it’s bringing you even if you stand at the same spot. But that doesn’t mean there’s no solution to that. I’ll tell you guys more about it when we get there,” replied Tang Yu.

Sand flow? Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that. Now, the Withernorth Sea was getting interesting. He had never seen a sea of sand before, so he could take this opportunity to brush up his scope.

As night descended, the Flamecloud Mountain Range became even darker, which loomed in everyone’s hearts. Occasionally, they could even hear beast roars coming from afar.

Suddenly, the party could hear footsteps approaching and they could tell that this approaching party had quite a bit of people. They ran into many parties along the way, but no one dared to provoke them with Tang Yu around. But it was different this time as it didn’t take long for a massive party to arrive before them.

When Mo Ling raised her head and looked over, her face changed. Even Liu Yunyan exclaimed out, “It’s the Threesolute Manor and Bloodwing Pavilion! They’re actually traveling together!”

The Threesolute Manor and Bloodwing Pavilion were quasi-overlord forces in the Nether Prefectural City just like the academy. However, the Bloodwing Pavilion wasn’t exactly on good terms with the academy, which Lin Yun experienced back in the Indigoflame Goldlotuses’ competition.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and he raised his head to see two youths leading the party. They were both in the pinnacle Yang stage and attracted everyone’s attention.

“It’s the Bloodwing Pavilion’s Leng Haoyu and Threesolute Manor’s Lin Zhiyuan!” Liu Yunyan whispered beside Lin Yun with fear lingering in her eyes.

Lin Yun found those names familiar and recalled that they were among the four elites in the Nether Prefectural City, which excluded the Profound Yang Palace’s disciples.

Among the four, Leng Haoyu had the highest ranking at eighty-seven. On the other hand, Lin Zhiyuan was slightly weaker as he was ranked ninety-seven. But regardless of their rankings, they were monstrous geniuses in the Ancient Southern Domain.

Those who could make it into the Dragoncloud Ranking didn’t just have a reputation, but also had the strength to back it up. When Lin Yun looked at them, he was briefly stunned to see that both the Bloodwing Pavilion and Threesolute Manor sent out a Heavenly Soul Realm expert.

“What a coincidence for us to run into the Heavenly Province Academy in such a massive mountain range. It has been a long time, Miss Mo!” Leng Haoyu was stunned when he saw the Heavenly Province Academy’s party before his eyes started to flicker.

“Sorry, but we were here first. You guys can leave now,” replied Mo Ling.

“First come, first served doesn’t work in this world. Otherwise, why would the demonic beast here be killed by you guys?” The youth standing beside Leng Haoyu smiled as he looked at Mo Ling. They had confidence in their strength, so their tone wasn't friendly.

The atmosphere became intense and enveloped everyone from the academy. In terms of martial technique’s foundation, the academy was naturally inferior to both of these forces, not to mention that the two forces were working together. So if they were insistent on chasing the Heavenly Province Academy away, they could only suck it up.

“You guys seem to have some preconceived ideas about us?” Zhang Yuan spoke right at this moment.

“Who the hell do you think you are? You think you’re qualified to speak here?” Lin Zhiyuan barked when he heard someone interrupt their conversation. When the two parties met, the Heavenly Soul Realm experts decided to leave this matter to the younger generation. So it was naturally rude that someone had interrupted the conversation. But it was a pity that Zhang Yuan wasn’t just anyone and that Lin Zhiyuan had flared up at the wrong time.

“My senior brother is a core disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect. Who the hell do you think you are?” Mu Chen said coldly as the other disciples from the Heavenly Sword Sect’s faces also became ugly.

When Lin Zhiyuan and Leng Haoyu heard that and saw the emblem on Zhang Yuan’s chest, they were surprised. After all, a quasi-overlord force still couldn’t be compared to a genuine overlord force.

“I’m sorry for my rudeness. I have no enmity towards the Heavenly Sword Sect. May I ask about your name?” Lin Zhiyuan apologized as he cupped his face. He had ultimately chosen to bow his head.

“I’m Zhang Yuan. You guys aren’t intending to fight here when we’re not even near the ancient tomb, right? Since we’ve occupied this place first, why don’t you guys take a step back and give the Heavenly Sword Sect some face? I believe the two seniors also won’t choose to fight with us here,” smiled Zhang Yuan.

The Flamecloud Mountain Range was incredibly massive, so this was just a matter of face. Zhang Yuan knew this well, which was why his gaze was on the two Heavenly Soul Realm experts instead of Lin Zhiyuan and Leng Haoyu.

Youngsters might fight because of face, but elders wouldn’t be that impulsive. After all, there wasn’t any profit for them to fight here.

“You’re right. A mere temporary camping ground has no need for Heavenly Soul Realm experts to act. Brother Zhang, what do you think of this instead…” Leng Haoyu suddenly smiled, “We both send someone out and exchange a move. The winner will stay, and the loser will scram. If you don’t mind, you can participate personally.”

Leng Haoyu kept smiling, but he wasn’t giving Zhang Yuan any face at all with his words, especially the last part that was filled with provocation. This meant that Leng Haoyu wasn’t afraid that Zhang Yuan was from a core disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect.
