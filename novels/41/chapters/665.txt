Chapter 666 - Half an Inch of Sword Ray

The breathing of the crowd could be heard in the massive plaza. It only took a second for them to find the source of the voice. But contrary to their expectations, the voice came from a youth who seemed to be in his seventeen or eighteen. He was donned in azure colored clothes and was carrying a sword box. The only thing that they could tell was that he was a swordsman.

But when they sensed that Lin Yun was only in the greater Yang stage, they were confused. They couldn’t believe that someone in the greater Yang stage dared to break the limit. Was he an outsider? Did he think that there was no one else in the Skymound City?

Various thoughts crossed their minds and they even doubted that Lin Yun could take out enough spiritual jades. But one thing was certain, the person who broke the limit was Lin Yun.

Currently, the geniuses from the four major clans and Skycloud Sect were filled with disdain while sitting in the pavilions. Even Xiang Tianhe was looking at Lin Yun with a playful gaze. Did Lin Yun think that he was still at the gathering from a few days ago?

The gathering might not have been small, but it was nothing compared to the Death Auction. Even Qing Ruoyou was surprised, but she soon recovered her composure as if she didn’t care about Lin Yun’s existence. To her, Lin Yun was like a clown who was vying for attention.

In the end, she merely snorted inwardly since she couldn’t be bothered with Lin Yun. Everyone’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun, but he ignored the gazes as he looked at the middle-aged man on the stage calmly. Since he had seen the Five Acute Lightning Crystals, he naturally had to obtain them. He had a premonition that the crystals could push his Azure Dragon Enneaform to the pinnacle third stage.

“You’re the one that called 310,000?” Luo Yu asked with a frown. He wasn’t too optimistic about Lin Yun, and doubted that Lin Yun could spend that many spiritual jades. The others that made bids either had a sect or a clan behind them. So where did this outsider get his confidence from?

“Do you see someone else standing aside from me? Who else could have made a bid but me?” Lin Yun smiled as he spoke in an unquestionable voice.

“Do you know the rules? Cut the crap and take out 300,000 third grade spiritual jades. Otherwise, I’ll kick you out immediately,” sneered Luo Yu. He wanted to see if Lin Yun could afford the price.

Lin Yun could tell from Luo Yu’s tone that he was doubtful that he had enough spiritual jades. “Third grade spiritual jades? I don’t have that much…”

Luo Yu’s gaze turned cold when he heard that and various people’s killing intent locked onto Lin Yun as they waited for him to finish his sentence.

“But I do have some fourth grade spiritual jades,” smiled Lin Yun as he tapped his interspatial pouch. In the next second, a pile of fourth grade spiritual jades appeared before Lin Yun that amounted to exactly 3,100.

Back in the Withernorth Sea, Lin Yun obtained a Heavenly Astral Pearl and ten thousand Astral Pearls. The Heavenly Astral Pearl was a seventh grade spiritual jade, and the ordinary Astral Pearls were fourth grade spiritual jades. A fourth grade spiritual jade was equivalent to a hundred third grade spiritual jades and many people were willing to exchange with him for it.

In the Ancient Southern Domain, only core disciples in the quasi-overlord forces had fourth grade spiritual jades, but not this many. So when 3,100 fourth grade spiritual jades appeared before everyone, a commotion broke out as they looked at Lin Yun with their faces changed.

Luo Yu quickly stepped forward with a smile. Taking all the fourth grade spiritual jades, he chuckled, “Haha, sorry for that. Here, these ten Five Acute Lightning Crystals are yours for now.”

Luo Yu was a businessman, so he handed the case of Five Acute Lightning Crystals over with a smile, which Lin Yun took and placed in his interspatial pouch.

“This item has already broken the limit. Does anyone want to compete for it?” Luo Yu swept his glance out. He was certain that someone would be interested, so he definitely wouldn’t let Lin Yun leave so easily.

“Me.” A clear voice echoed as a figure descended before Lin Yun. This person was donned in extraordinary looking clothes, carried a spear behind him, and looked to be in his twenties. He was in the pinnacle Yang stage and it seemed like he would reach the Yin-Yang stage soon. Judging by his aura, he was actually stronger than Jin Yan whom he met seven days ago. With just a glance, Lin Yun could tell that this was a genius who could fight those above his cultivation.

“It’s Feng Xun!”

“So it’s Feng Xun of the Skycloud Sect. He’s a rising talent of the Skycloud Sect.”

“I heard that many of the sect elders in the Yin-Yang stage couldn’t even take ten moves from him. His rise cannot be stopped. I also heard that he’s only nineteen.” People instantly recognized Feng Xun because he was a famous person in the Skymound City.

“Here.” Feng Xun gave Luo Yu an interspatial pouch.

Receiving the pouch with his eyes narrowed, Luo Yu looked around, “Anyone else?”

Many people hesitated before they shook their heads since they saw Feng Xun was participating. After all, Feng Xun was a famous figure who was from the Skycloud Sect, which was the strongest sect in Skymound City. So they naturally had to give face to the local experts.

“Very well. The two of you will compete for it. You two have signed the Life-Death Agreement, so no one can pursue the matter if you die before you can surrender. Keep in mind that even if the treasures are tempting, life is more important,” smiled Luo Yu as he looked at Lin Yun. Clearly, he was speaking to Lin Yun.

But it wasn’t because he didn’t care about Lin Yun. He just didn’t want to see Lin Yun die as it would be a pity. The moment he finished speaking, he soared into the sky and pointed at the plaza. Then, the mats began to shift and a spacious ground was revelaed.

“Skymound City, Skycloud Sect, Feng Xun.” Feng Xun introduced.

“Great Qin Empire, Sword Firmament Pavilion, Lin Yun.” Lin Yun introduced himself as well.

When Feng Xun heard Lin Yun introducing himself, his eyes flashed with disdain as he said, “Don’t say that I’m bullying you. I’ll let you attack first or else you won’t even be able to take three attacks from me.”

When he finished speaking, he released a powerful aura as he retrieved the spear on his back. As he shook his wrist, a powerful aura began to gather on the tip of his spear.

“You can go first. I’m looking forward to seeing how you defeat me in three moves,” said Lin Yun as the Flower Burial Sword began to buzz in the sword box in response to the pressure coming from Feng Xun.

“As you wish!” Feng Xun’s eyes flashed coldly as he twirled the spear in his hand. In the next second, a bizarre scene occurred as everything in the path of the spear began to freeze as if time had stopped.

The stage began to rumble before he stabbed his spear towards Lin Yun. When everyone saw this scene, they began to shake their heads in pity. After all, they had already determined that Lin Yun’s 3,100 fourth grade spiritual jades would go down the drain.

The Skycloud Sect’s disciples were proficient in spear techniques. So their movement and cultivation techniques mainly focused on their spear techniques. Rumour had it that they would spend ten years tempering the aura of their spear. So if the attack that they had been tempering for ten years could shock everyone, they could continue to remain in the Skycloud Sect. Otherwise, they would be expelled from the sect.

Clearly, Feng Xun belonged to the former. Not only did he remain in Skycloud City, but he also became a genius among the disciples. Not many Yin-Yang stage experts could take his spear, not to mention Lin Yun.

“Holy…” Guo Xu and Yang Fan’s faces changed as they couldn’t bear to watch this scene. The Skycloud Sect’s geniuses weren’t pushovers and Feng Xun was immediately displaying his strength.

But a bizarre scene took place as a sword buzz rang out from Lin Yun’s body. A boundless sword intent exploded from Lin Yun along with dazzling silver light that condensed to an Iris Flower.

When everyone recovered from the blinding flash, their faces changed as Feng Xun’s attack couldn’t move any further. Feng Xun’s face became ugly as he discovered that he couldn’t pull his spear back. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Die!” Feng Xun barked as he unleashed all his origin energy trying to stab his sword forward.

“You want to defeat me within three moves with only this much ability? You can’t even break my sword aura. You should go back to where you came from!” Lin Yun snorted as he summoned his Flower Burial Sword.

When he drew his sword by half an inch, a dazzling flash exploded. This knocked Feng Xun’s spear away and Feng Xun was sent flying with a terrifying gash on his chest.

“You…” Feng Xun was furious. But just when he was about to take a step forward, Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword and left a line on the ground. It was half an inch in front of Feng Xun’s right foot.

“Treasures might be good, but it’s better to cherish your life,” said Lin Yun indifferently.

When Feng Xun raised his head, Lin Yun had already sheathed his sword. This meant that Feng Xun couldn’t even see how Lin Yun attacked. In the next second, he felt a chill run down his spine.

“I guess the Five Acute Lightning Crystals are mine now?” Lin Yun turned around and looked at Luo Yu indifferently.

Luo Yu recovered from his shock and quickly nodded his head, “Young friend, who the hell are you?”

“Just someone insignificant from the Great Qin Empire,” said Lin Yun as he took a step forward and returned to the mat he was previously sitting on.
