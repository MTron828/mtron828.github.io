Chapter 306 - Chaos

Han Zhengyang, Xin Wuhen, and Lu Hexuan had fallen into the sea of flames. Whether they were alive or dead was unknown. But even if they managed to survive, they would have to rest for at least half a year to recover from their injuries.

There was even a possibility that they would be crippled, which would feel even more terrible than death. This scene shocked many people and they turned to look at Lin Yun with grave expressions.

Everyone from the Gentlemen Union looked at Lin Yun with an unsightly face. They still thought that they could deal with Lin Yun however they liked, but they never imagined that Lin Yun would display such frightening strength.

Among the inner disciples, there was a blue-clothed youth who suddenly opened his eyes as splendour flickered through his eyes. He was shocked by Lin Yun’s physique. He never imagined that someone would actually succeed in practicing the Primal Chaos Sect’s Dracophant Battle Physique.

However, he didn’t think that Lin Yun’s origin energy was stronger than his. The Firecloud Art that he cultivated could make his origin energy blaze like fire and no one in the fifth stage could take more than ten palms from him. Then again, Lin Yun’s fist technique seemed troublesome.

When he saw how Lin Yun fused the seals together, he knew that this was a monster. The youth then smiled. It looks like I won’t be able to get the cosmic artifact so easily now.

Compared to other disciples who stood out, he maintained a low-profile. Not many in the inner sect were acquainted with him.

The Gentlemen Union looked at Lin Yun in fear, except for Chu Haoyu. The second strongest in the Gentlemen Union, Wu Bing, spoke out, “Senior Brother Chu, do you have to come with us? Senior Brother Wang already said that it’s fine even if we sacrifice ourselves for you to obtain first place.”

As he spoke, the elites from the Gentlemen Union came before Chu Haoyu, “Please give us your instruction!”

Chu Haoyu was shocked. He never expected that Wang Yan would go this far just for him to become the champion. But he wouldn’t do that out of his pride. He replied, “There’s no need for that. First place is mine. Wang Yan is looking down on me to think that I’ll need you guys to help me. Furthermore, I can easily defeat Lin Yun if I want. My strongest opponent isn’t him.”

If he wasn’t concerned with some of the opponents who were hiding in the dark, he would’ve already made his move against Lin Yun. Han Zhengyang thought that he could do whatever he wanted after refining the Imperial Sword Herb, but he was just a fool.

“Our greatest enemy here isn’t Lin Yun?” The Gentlemen Union’s disciples were shocked.

“You guys will find out soon. The final battle has just started. So let’s enjoy the show for now,” smiled Chu Haoyu.

After Han Zhengyang, Xin Wuhan, and Lu Hexuan were defeated, the intense battle came to a brief pause. However, this was just calm before the storm.

The Asura Alliance’s disciples spoke with grave expressions, “Senior Brother Jiang, the Gentlemen Union actually didn’t make a move against Lin Yun.”

“That’s not surprising. Because of Chu Haoyu’s pride, he believes that killing Lin Yun is nothing. His goal has always been the cosmic artifact. Now that he witnessed Lin Yun’s strength, he won’t make a move abruptly to give others an opportunity,” smiled Jiang Feng with disdain.

“Then what should we do?”

“We will wait and see,” replied Jiang Feng. He sneered inwardly. He was very unhappy with Chu Haoyu. If Chu Haoyu didn’t consider him an enemy, then he was in for a huge surprise later. Everyone thought that his Originmurk Art reached complete mastery thanks to the Imperial Sword Herb, but no one knew that his cultivation technique was already at complete mastery.

This meant that no one knew what he got from the Imperial Sword Herb. This was his trump card and he didn’t wish to reveal it so early.

“How are you?” Li Wuyou arrived next to Lin Yun after dealing with his opponent.

“I’m fine. I just exhausted some origin energy. Anyway, be careful. There are experts among the inner disciples that even Chu Haoyu is cautious about.” Lin Yun defeated the trio because he wanted to intimidate the top ten on the Mortal Ranking.

After all, he would be placed in a disadvantageous position if all of them came at him right away. But fortunately, these people were cautious after witnessing his strength. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Lin Yun smiled because there was a lot of garbage in the top ten. Earlier, he noticed a frightening gaze coming from the inner disciples, but it disappeared as soon as he tried to find the source. This meant that there was an expert among the inner disciples.

As time slowly passed, the disciples became more cautious. At the same time, tens of humanoid flaming monsters were suddenly formed in the sea of flames. These monsters carried sword intent and they attacked the disciples closest to them without any warnings.

This surprised many disciples, causing them to cry out as they fell into the sea of flames. In a split second, hundreds of people were eliminated as they fell into the sea of flames. This was when the brutality of the final battle was revealed.

“Flaming Souls!” Everyone exclaimed at this scene. These monsters were the Flaming Souls mentioned by Bai Ting. They were created because of the mutated flame vein underground that basked in sword intent throughout the years. Furthermore, the Flaming Souls were comparable to sixth stage demonic beasts, but they were more terrifying. After all, they had a powerful physique and didn’t fear death.

“It looks like there aren’t any loopholes or shortcuts in the final battle,” sighed Lin Yun. There were those who naturally wanted to avoid a battle, but it was impossible with the Flaming Souls around. This also meant that forcing yourself to stay in the Sword Tomb would only result in pointless death.

“Damn it!”

“These Flaming Souls can’t be killed…”

“What should we do?” The Sword Tomb plunged into chaos.

Back on the observation platform, the disciples and elders all wore a grave expression. The final battle was too intense. This Alliance-Union Battle was truly the toughest in the past century. Through this method, it would be ensured that the hundred remaining disciples were the absolute elites that didn’t rely on luck. Furthermore, those who made it into the top ten rankings would be known as monsters that could be groomed by the sect.

But this chaos meant that no one could continue hiding. When the Flaming Souls appeared, some disciples retained their composure while some even looked at the Flaming Souls with anticipation. After all, the crystals were even more precious than Swordcloud Cores.

“They can’t be killed?” The blue-clothed youth, Chang Wu, threw a punch and destroyed a Flaming Soul. When it regenerated, he noticed that flames on it were dimmer than before.

“It doesn’t seem terrifying at all,” smiled Chang Wu. He then smacked the Flaming Soul with his palm. His origin energy blazed like flames that were even more ferocious than the Flaming Souls.

The Flaming Soul dissipated once more and regathered itself. Right at this moment, a cold light flashed in Chang Wu’s eyes. His hand plunged into the Flaming Soul and retrieved a crimson crystal.

By just holding onto it, Chang Wu could sense his cultivation technique circulating violently. It was a perfect match for the Firecloud Art. He even had hopes of reaching complete mastery if he had a few more.

“You’ve hidden pretty well.” A figure appeared before Chang Wu when the Flaming Soul dissipated.

“Chu Haoyu?” Chang Wu smiled bitterly, “Junior Brother Chu, have you recognized the wrong person? I’m not your opponent.”

He then pointed to Lin Yun. Lin Yun was also facing a Flaming Soul and he held the upper-hand.

“He only joined the sect and reached the fifth stage recently. His cultivation is his greatest disadvantage. He’s lucky if he can make it into the top ten, but you and I both know that he’s not the strongest here,” said Chu Haoyu.

“That means you’re going to act against me?” smiled Chang Wu bitterly.

“The title of champion belongs to me and I’ll kill whoever stands in my way!” Chu Haoyu stabbed his sword forward, producing an earth-shaking collision.

“Chu Haoyu drew his sword!” The sword was so bright that it caught everyone’s attention. The inner disciples were shocked when they saw it. Chu Haoyu was attacking Chang Wu? Wasn’t that fellow ranked number one thousand on the Earth Ranking? Why did Chu Haoyu pay attention to someone like him?
