Chapter 755 - Three Thousand Years Flamedragon Fruit

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because the Indigothunder Dragonvulture was an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast. He had witnessed how powerful it was and it was practically invincible. It was even able to kill several Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts while it was heavily injured. Judging by the roar it just unleashed, it was pretty injured once again.

“Let’s go and take a look.” Lin Yun quickly made up his mind as he executed the Seven Profound Steps and soared into the sky. Although it was just a Profound Martial Realm movement technique, Lin Yun had brought it to the manifestation stage, so it was extremely fast when he pushed the Iris Sword Sutra to the limit.

Gold light flashed in the sky as the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s roar became even clearer. Lin Yun could feel that the air was filled with a dense demonic aura and the stench of blood.

“The smell is strong. A lot of demonic beasts must have been killed.” Lin Yun's face changed as he retracted his aura and landed on the ground. It didn’t take long for him to arrive on a hill where he saw countless craters. It looked like thousands of meteorites had fallen to the earth.

In addition to the creators were the scattered corpses of many Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts. The corpses were piled together and none of them were complete. From that alone, Lin Yun could tell how bitter the battle was.

Sweeping his gaze, Lin Yun saw the Indigothunder Dragonvulture facing two Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts. It wasn’t in a good state as both its wings had been crippled and wounds covered its entire body. The wound on its neck was especially striking as blood poured out of it.

It was lined up against a crimson wolf and a yellow python. The python’s massive body was coiled up and if one didn’t take note of it clearly, one would mistake it for a hill.

Weird… Lin Yun had a weird feeling. These demonic beasts might be terrifying, but they shouldn’t be able to fight the Indigothunder Dragonvulture. Just who could possibly injure it?

Suddenly, the ground began to tremble as a violent energy fluctuation swept over. While he was in deep thoughts, the three demonic beasts clashed once more. Their battle was more brutal than a fight between cultivators. They used every part of their bodies as their weapons and each clash would cause an earth-shaking commotion.

In the blink of an eye, the fight between the demonic beasts became chaotic. They were massive, but they were extremely fast. Their speed even exceeded that of cultivators with high-quality movement techniques. But it wouldn’t take long for the victor to be determined. The Indigothunder Dragonvulture was sent flying by the yellow python as countless serpent scales fell from the sky.

The crimson wolf took advantage of the yellow python and bit its flesh. However, the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s used this opportunity to take advantage of the crimson wolf, attacking it swiftly and sending it flying. If the Indigothunder Dragonvulture was in its peak condition, its claw would’ve killed the crimson wolf. Unfortunately, since it was weak, it was only able to send it flying.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture then rolled on the ground with blood dripping from its wounds. The python stuck out its tongue as it slithered over cautiously, putting pressure on the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture became anxious as it roared and tried to get back on its feet. But no matter how hard it tried, it wasn’t able to get back up. When the yellow python was only a thousand meters away from the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, the python stopped as its crimson eyes stared at the latter. The python’s demonic aura began to grow and dyed the sky red.

When the sky was dyed red, the python pounced at the Indigothunder Dragonvulture to bite its neck. This was a lethal attack from the python. But before it could reach the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, the sky suddenly turned dark and a sword ray hit the python.

Overlord Sword?—Solar Slash!

Just like that, the massive python was knocked back and fell to the ground. Lin Yun was holding onto his sword with lightning flickering in his eyes. His sword intent had manifested into a terrifying lightning sphere that radiated brightly.

When the python landed on the ground, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed sharply as he swung his sword once again. Overlord Sword?—Big Bang!

In that split second, starlight shrouded in lightning landed on the yellow python. The attack created a huge crater on its body and nearly split it in half. Then, a wave of hot air swept towards Lin Yun, but he avoided it and grabbed the crimson wolf’s claw. The crimson wolf had come back after it was sent flying.

Lin Yun’s body flashed as he began his fight with the wolf in mid-air. Compared to the crimson wolf’s massive figure, Lin Yun was tiny. However, his Overlord Sword’s aura wasn’t any weaker than the crimson wolf’s aura. In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun exchanged over a hundred moves.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Lin Yun purposely revealed a flaw. When the crimson wolf’s claw destroyed his afterimage, the corner of Lin Yun’s lips rose as he unleashed eighteen lightning bolts that wove into a net.

Overlord Sword?—Thunderbolt Slash!

There was no way the crimson wolf could avoid this attack as it was sent flying. Its skin was torn apart by Lin Yun’s attack and it released a painful cry. When it landed on the ground, the crimson wolf unleashed a ferocious roar at Lin Yun with its fur standing up. Its entire body had doubled in size and flames began to gather on its body.

“Puny tricks.” Lin Yun smiled as he raised his Flower Burial Sword. Immense sword aura soared into the sky like a blazing sun behind Lin Yun. The phenomenon was massive and it was more refined than the crimson wolf’s flames.

Overlord Sword?—Breaking Dawn!

Just like that, Lin Yun clashed with the wolf once more as terrifying flames dyed the sky red. The flames from Lin Yun’s attack incinerated all of the wolf’s fur, causing it to lower its head and run away. It was almost like the wolf was too embarrassed to stay behind. Even the yellow python fled with great speed.

Lin Yun pondered briefly, but chose not to chase after them. After all, they were ultimately Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts, so it would be troublesome if they went all out. Turning back to look at the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, he noticed that its vitality was slowly fading away. However, its eyes were still fixed onto Lin Yun.

Clearly, it sensed its blood essence from Lin Yun. It was this despicable human who stole its blood essence while it was heavily injured, which left it greatly weakened for a long time.

“Do you still remember me?” Lin Yun wore an awkward expression. After all, it wasn’t righteous of him to steal the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s blood essence. He should defeat the demonic beast openly before taking its blood essence. This was also the reason why he saved the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, not to mention that he also wanted to test his current strength.

But he was disappointed as he couldn’t bring out his full power against a Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast. He didn’t even have to bring out his spiritual sword intent to defeat the two demonic beasts.

“How should I save this fellow?” Lin Yun felt a headache creeping up. Although he had tons of pellets, they were meant for human cultivators and some of them could be poisonous to demonic beasts.

Oh wait! Lin Yun quickly retrieved the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s beast core and tossed it at the Indigothunder Dragonvulture before it could react.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture hesitated briefly before it swallowed the beast core. Then, purple lightning began to spread out on its body. In the next moment, lightning began to rumble from within its body and its blood started boiling. To top it off, its overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast aura started to spread out.

Fifteen minutes later, the Indigothunder Dragonvulture unleashed a roar that created a soundwave as it began to stand. Its wounds were recovering at a visible speed as its aura slowly became even more powerful. It was truly the overlord of this region.

“How powerful!” Lin Yun was alarmed. After comprehending the spiritual sword intent, he had a clear understanding of how powerful this Indigothunder Dragonvulture was. The terrifying pressure contained a violent aura that could penetrate into people’s souls.

As it gradually recovered, its wounds were no longer that terrifying. There was only a wound beneath its neck that had yet to recover. Then, its scales began to spread out and cover the wound.

Is that the wound that left it in such a terrible state? Lin Yun pondered inwardly and determined that it must be the case. That wound was even more fatal than the one on its neck, which is why it must have developed scales to protect this spot.

“Swordsman, thank you for saving my life.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture spoke, but its speech wasn’t smooth. Lin Yun was baffled before he was able to make sense of it. Powerful demonic beast had intelligence comparable to a human, but only an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast could speak human words easily.

“Who injured you?” Lin Yun asked.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture lowered its head and looked at Lin Yun briefly before it replied, “You’re not his opponent, so it's useless even if I tell you about it. He wants to know the location of the Flamedragon Fruit. I was injured because I didn’t tell him about it. But I’m not sure if he’s still alive right now.”

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture might sound calm, but Lin Yun could guess that it was an earth-shaking battle.

“Flamedragon Fruit? That doesn’t seem worth the attention of a Heavenly Soul Realm expet…” Lin Yun muttered. He had obtained a Flamedragon Fruit before reaching the Violet Palace Realm. It might be rare, but he wouldn’t be interested in it if he found one now.

“What if this one is three thousand years old and contains the Flame Dragon’s blood essence?” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture words left Lin Yun shocked. “Would you be interested in it? I can bring you there, but you better not have high hopes for it.”

Then, the Indigothunder Dragonvulture turned around, signalling Lin Yun to get on its back.
