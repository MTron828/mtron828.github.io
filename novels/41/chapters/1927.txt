Chapter 1928 - Knowing The Severity, Knowing When To Retreat

It was naturally best for him to have more trump cards. He had already revealed the Divine Firefly Sword, but he still had four sword forms left that he hadn’t revealed. But it was unavoidable that others might be prepared for it.

So he had to improve his Astral Sword Intent in two months. Although he might not have had the opportunity to use the Astral Sword Intent in Di Group, he also had to stabilize it. Even if he limited himself to the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, his sword intent would be much stronger than others.

When Lin Yun reopened his eyes, two days had passed, and the speck of spark within his sword sea grew to the size of an infant’s fist.

“I wonder how Senior Brother was able to cultivate his sword intent…” Lin Yun sighed. Astral Sword Intent was harder to cultivate than he had imagined, and he had exhausted all his resources to come this far. But it had barely reached lesser mastery, and he had only stabilized his sword intent.

He had used up all the seven-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits, and it would be hard for him to improve his sword intent in the future, but he was fortunate that he was shameless. If he had concerns back then, he wouldn’t be able to improve his Astral Sword Intent so much.

But when could he reach the same height as his senior brother? His senior brother might have grasped the Astral Sword Intent while he was at the Dragon Pulse Realm, but Lin Yun was much younger than him, and his senior brother was forced to stay at the Dragon Pulse Realm for two decades.

Lin Yun stood and waved his hand, summoning the star from his sword sea and having it hover above his palm. This star shone brightly with a golden radiance and filled up this entire space. As for Lin Yun, he looked like he had donned golden armor, and even his hair became golden, emitting a sacred aura. Looking from afar, it looked as though he was holding onto a sun in his palm.

“Knowing the severity, knowing when to retreat… I finally understand it now,” Lin Yun sighed. He had to thank the white-clothed man; the latter had saved his life, or there might be consequences.

A baby naturally couldn’t swing a sword even if you gave them a sword, but does an adult know how heavy it was after holding it?

Letting the tea fill the entire cup was the best way to use it.

“Take now, for example…” The star returned to his sword sea and unleashed his Astral Sword Intent. The massive Astral Sword Intent filled Lin Yun’s ten dragon pulses before coursing through his body, and his sword aura reached a terrifying height. Under immense pressure, even the Three-Lives Realm became unstable.

“This way, I can bring out 120% of my Astral Sword Intent’s power.” Lin Yun raised his head and executed the Sword of the Beginning with his Astral Sword Intent, and the space around him began to tremble. When he grasped his sword, fine cracks appeared within the Three-Lives Realm.

As he slowly drew his sword, the entire space began to shrink. After he drew his sword entirely, the surrounding space within a hundred miles began to overlap, with fine cracks appearing. But when he sheathed his sword, the fine cracks reached a hundred meters away, and there was an afterimage a hundred meters away as if he had appeared there with a footstep.

“Space dao is really profound…” Lin Yun exclaimed, looking at his afterimage. But it was just as he had expected, and he seemed to be able to swing his sword again.

He couldn’t imagine how powerful it would be to swing his sword nine times. He wondered how powerful it would become if he perfected the profundity contained within this sword and what would happen if it really became the Sword of the Beginning that he had imagined. This wouldn’t be an easy journey, but he was determined to walk on this sword path that belonged to himself.

Lin Yun briefly rested before he summoned as many constellations as possible, and he summoned eight constellations; each was an ominous beast. He muttered, “One more left…”

The Heavenly Burial Constellation had a total of nine paintings. Aside from the eight ominous beasts, there was the sword that subdued the eight ominous beasts.

“It looks like I can only combine the nine paintings after reaching the Nirvana Stage, but which painting should I use…” Lin Yun naturally couldn’t mimic Ye Qingtian’s constellation, so he picked Kunpeng.

He had never used this constellation before and could claim to have inherited the constellation of the saint origin that he had refined. When he was done, he backed out from the Three-Lives Realm and stowed the Three-Lives Fruit.

Turning back, he discovered that the Azure Dragon Sword Heart might be the smallest among all his harvests. It might be a rough shape of a domain, but it was only equivalent to a magnifying glass. If there was a slightly stronger external force, the domain would immediately shatter. Lin Yun had no idea how powerful the Azure Dragon Sword Heart was, and it was far beyond his imagination.

Lin Yun had cultivated for two months and no longer wanted to cultivate. He had to head to the Heavenly Dao Altar in an hour, and he couldn’t achieve anything in this hour even if he tried.

Lin Yun took out a brush and paper to practice his calligraphy, since he had nothing to do. His master, the Radiant Sword Saint, was fond of calligraphy; each stroke contained great profundity. But it was a pity that ever since Lin Yun left the Ancient Barren Battlefield, he had no more opportunities to execute the Carefree 9 Swords.

Everyone knew that the Radiant Sword Saint taught it to Lin Yun, and everyone could instantly recognize him if he used it.

“Hehe. Big Brother Lin, what are you writing?” A peal of laughter resounded as Lil’ Purple appeared.

Seeing Lil’ Purple so happy, Lin Yun knew she must have found something. He asked, “You found it?”

“Yeah. The Solar Lunar Divine Rune is in the Nether Orchid Courtyard. The aura was too weak the past few times, but I sensed it this time!” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun knew that it wasn’t that simple, or it would make no sense why Lil’ Purple could sense it this time and not the other times. Lil’ Purple practically searched the entire Nether Orchid Courtyard over the past few days.

If the Solar Lunar Divine Rune existed, it made no sense for it to alternate between weak and clear. Wang Muyan would’ve found it long ago if it was that easy.

“I really found it. It’s in the Celestial Pool!” Lil’ Purple said.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he heard that, and he now knew why Lil’ Purple was so sweet in calling him ‘Big Brother Lin’.

“Hehe. Big Brother Lin, when are you bringing me to the Celestial Pool? Why don’t we go after the Ranking Battle?” Lil’ Purple wore an adorable smile.

“We’ll see, then,” Lin Yun replied.

“Hmph, you scumbag. You clearly promised me!” Lil’ Purple instantly became unhappy.

On the other hand, Lin Yun merely smiled and continued his calligraphy. When he finished the last word, Lil’ Purple came over, seeing that Lin Yun was ignoring her. “What are you writing? Let me take a look…”

When Lil’ Purple ran over, she recited, “That’s because everyone else is mediocre in my eyes, while you stood out like a bright star. You’re like a phoenix amongst a flock of birds.”

Lil’ Purple’s face blushed, and she bashfully said, “You don’t have to praise me in this manner…”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Someone said it to me,” Lin Yun smiled and shared his experience on the Celestial Purging Mountain with her.

After hearing what Lin Yun said, Lil’ Purple lost interest and muttered, “Hmph… You’re a fake phoenix, and I’m the real phoenix. If he sees me, he will immediately bow down to me and obediently hand over the Emperor Sword.”

Lin Yun merely laughed it off and burned his calligraphy. He raised his head and said, “Then you help me obtain the Emperor Sword, and I’ll help you get the Solar Lunar Divine Rune.”

Lil’ Purple was sitting on the sword box, glaring at Lin Yun, “You scumbag.”

“We can’t rush with the Solar Lunar Divine Rune and need a plan. It’s definitely not as simple as you think,” Lin Yun said.

“I naturally know that, but I’m anxious about it…” Lil’ Purple said.

Seeing Lil’ Purple’s pitiful look, Lin Yun sighed, “Alright. I’ll find a way to enter the Celestial Pool after the Ranking Battle.”

“Really?!” Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up, and she sat on Lin Yun’s shoulder. She chuckled, “I knew that you’re the best!”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled when he saw this, knowing that her pitiful act fooled him.

“Don’t worry about it. Bai Shuying won’t kill you. When I subdue the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, I’ll give her to you as your maid. At that time, you can do whatever you want with her…”

But before she could finish, Lin Yun looked at her weirdly. This instantly made Lil’ Purple’s face blush, and she ran away. “Hmph, you scumbag. I’m only speaking your thoughts.”

Seeing this, Lin Yun only shook his head and headed to the Heavenly Dao Altar because the Ranking Battle would soon start!
