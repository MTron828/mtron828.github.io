Chapter 1936 - Who The Hell Are You?

Quasi-Saint Chi Yun was speechless, looking at Ye Qingtian’s embarrassed and innocent expression. Not only did he make Wang Yue admit defeat, but he released his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at complete mastery to make four out of eight opponents go down on their knees.

He chased away the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, while Zhang Yue, Lin Beitong, and Ye Feifan couldn’t even touch the corner of his clothes and were defeated with one sword. But even so, Ye Qingtian didn’t let them go and purposely buried them.

“Ye Qingtian, move out of the way. If you drag this on any longer, Zhang Yue, Lin Beitong, and Ye Feifan will take their last breath.” The moment he finished speaking, a figure descended from the Heavenly Dao Altar. It was the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign.

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign was anxious, waving his hand and removing the rubble, revealing the buried trio. The trio coughed, indicating that they were still alive.

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign quickly stepped forth and examined Zhang Yue’s injuries before he took a deep breath. Zhang Yue’s ribs were broken, and his internal organs were in a terrible state, aside from his heart. His nine dragon pulses were also tangled, and the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign couldn’t help glaring at Ye Qingtian because it was simply too ruthless. He could tell Ye Qingtian had spared Zhang Yue’s life, but he still couldn’t help being furious.

Lin Yun took several steps back in alert, fearing that the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign might lose his rationale. But he considered too much because the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign wouldn’t dare to make a move against him. The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign only wanted to reprimand Ye Qingtian for his ruthlessness by habit.

But before the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign could open his mouth, a burst of laughter resounded from the Heavenly Dao Altar, “Hahaha!”

The laughter made the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign’s face change, and he quickly shut his mouth, not daring to say a word.

Right then, a figure descended and hovered in the air. This person was naturally the Dragon Origin Great Saint, who was in a good mood as he looked at the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign. He said, “Tu You, you remember what I said?”

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign didn’t dare to look at the Dragon Origin Great Saint and replied, “Dragon Origin Great Saint. The champion is easily within Ye Qingtian’s reach.”

“Hahaha!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint was in a good mood and grabbed Lin Yun’s shoulder. He said, “Ye Qingtian, come with me!”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint ignored everyone’s gazes and soared to the sky with Lin Yun before the latter could even respond. Just like that, they disappeared under everyone’s envious eyes. This was because Ye Qingtian was a Great Saint’s direct disciple, and he wouldn’t be in trouble even if he killed a Saint Sovereign’s disciple. On the other hand, the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign had to be respectful to the Dragon Origin Great Saint. This was the huge difference between them.

“The Dragon Origin Great Saint has accepted a good disciple!”

“He’s also decisive in accepting Ye Qingtian as his disciple. Who could’ve imagined that Ye Qingtian would change?”

“It appears that the Dragon Origin Great Saint is fond of that disciple.”

“Speaking of which, Ye Qingtian’s last sword has come in contact with spatial dao, right?”

“It should be the case. With his talent, he might be able to grasp spatial dao in the future.” The Saint Elders exclaimed on the Heavenly Dao Altar.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint shook her head because the Dragon Origin Great Saint was like a child, fearing she might snatch his disciple. But speaking of which, she couldn’t help feeling an intimacy with Ye Qingtian.

She had seen Ye Qingtian before, and he had a unique temperament. It appears that she would have to visit Ye Guhan when he returns.

Although the Dragon Origin Great Saint took away Ye Qingtian, everyone was still shocked by what Ye Qingtian had displayed, regardless of whether it was that final sword or rejecting Wang Muyan’s request. There was no doubt that this would be a long conversation.

While everyone was envious of Lin Yun, Lin Yun arrived at the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s residence. Unlike others, the Dragon Origin Great Saint wasn’t polite and threw him to the ground.

But Lin Yun swiftly responded and gently tapped his foot in the air to stabilize himself. If it was someone else, they would’ve fallen to the ground.

“Not bad. That should be the Dragon Pulse Realm section of the Divine Sunchasing Art. It’s impressive that you can reach this far, but it can barely keep up with your cultivation at the Profound Death Stage, and it’ll be lacking after you reach the Nirvana Stage,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said as he sat on the mat.

“Master.” Lin Yun paid his respect with a bow.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint looked at Lin Yun with a smile, and he asked, “Ye Qingtian, what is the current grade of your sword intent?”

Lin Yun was confused that the Dragon Origin Great Saint couldn’t see through his sword intent, and he instantly figured out that it must be because of the Sword Saint’s Sword Heart in his sea of consciousness. But he wasn’t too confident about that and could only honestly reply, “I have just reached the Astral Sword Intent.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint dropped his smile and became surprised. He muttered, “You have really achieved the Astral Sword Intent.”

Lin Yun did not dare to reply because he had no idea what the Dragon Origin Great Saint meant.

“You’ve seen that person?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint sighed.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun knew the Dragon Origin Great Saint must be talking about that mysterious white-clothed man on the Celestial Purging Mountain.

“What did he tell you?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint asked.

“He only said I’m his grand disciple and nothing else. Master, who is he? Is he the third sword wielder in the Heavenly Dao Sect?” Lin Yun asked.

“No,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint sighed. “He’s the previous sect master of the Heavenly Dao Sect. He lost to Yu Qingfeng after being too conceited. He died when he came back.”

Lin Yun was stunned and asked, “The Heavenly Dao Sect has a sect master?”

He heard from Chen Feng that the Heavenly Dao Sect had no sect master.

“Of course,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said. “Who doesn’t want to become the sect master? But the two words ‘Heavenly Dao’ are heavy, and no one has the fate to bear it. You'll die within a year if your fate can’t bear it. So as time passed, no one dared to become the sect master, which is why everyone thought we didn’t have a sect master. But the moment someone becomes the sect master, he will definitely be a peerless genius and bring the Heavenly Dao Sect back to glory. A person like that is rare, and my martial ancestor is someone like that. He was one of the strongest in this world before the Nine Emperors rose to fame, and the Heavenly Dao Sect was one of the strongest forces in the Kunlun Realm with a high chance of ruling the Kunlun Realm.”

Lin Yun did know that the Heavenly Dao Sect’s forces stretched throughout the Kunlun Realm at their prime.

But it was a pity that they were born at the wrong time. Many experts, like the old sect master of the Heavenly Dao Sect, were eliminated when the Nine Emperors rose because the Southern Emperor was too powerful three millennia ago, and he could only be described as invincible.

“How did he clash with Yu Qingfeng?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint sighed, “The title of Sword Emperor belonged to my martial ancestor before Yu Qingfeng. After Yu Qingfeng sliced off two peaks from the Sword Sect, his fame rose and he challenged my martial ancestor. The sect’s elders were against it, but the martial ancestor was conceited and didn’t place Yu Qingfeng in his eyes.”

“What’s the outcome, then?” Lin Yun asked.

“What else? The title of Sword Emperor was taken away. When the old sect master returned, he only said that Yu Qingfeng wouldn’t dare to be so cocky if the Emperor Sword was still around before he died,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint replied.

Hearing what the Dragon Origin Great Saint said, Lin Yun could feel his blood boiling. He was sure that it must have been a grand era three millennia ago. The Three Monarchs ruled while the Nine Emperors rose and ended the Dark Era.

Now that he thought about it again, the Nine Emperors didn’t just end the Dark Era but powerful experts like the Heavenly Dao Sect’s sect master as well.

“After that, the Heavenly Dao Sect has declined, with most of our branches either being destroyed or usurped. But it’s fortunate that we still have two sword wielders, or the Heavenly Dao Sect would follow behind the Sword Sect’s footsteps and fall from being a holy land,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said as he stood up.

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun asked.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Yu Qingfeng wanted to repeat what he did to the Sword Sect.”

“What happened then?”

“He was naturally taught a lesson by the two sword wielders and was trapped in the Heavenly Dao Altar,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint sighed. “But the Southern Emperor came by himself and rescued Yu Qingfeng. Even the two sword wielders couldn’t stop him, just like the other holy lands.”

Lin Yun instantly understood what happened, proving that the Heavenly Dao Sect had a deep foundation.

“The Sword Emperor defeated the old sect master, while the Southern Emperor broke our spine, and the Heavenly Dao Sect no longer dares to step out of the Eastern Desolation,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint sighed. “In just a blink of an eye, it has already been three thousand years. But fortunately, the Southern Emperor died, or the Divine Dragon Empire’s territory would cover the entire Kunlun Realm if the Nine Emperors joined hands.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling complicated as he listened to the story. The Sword Emperor left after the Southern Emperor died while the Demon Emperor established his own force. Even the Empress had become the Divine Dragon Empress.

“Master, why are you telling me this?” Lin Yun asked after he recollected himself.

“I just can’t help reminiscing about the past after hearing you’ve seen the old sect master. The old sect master was also famous in the Dark Era, but it is a pity that the world could only contain one Sword Emperor,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint replied.

Lin Yun instantly understood that the title of the Sword Emperor could only belong to one person, and it wasn’t something anyone could call themselves. Yu Qingfeng used his sword to make everyone know he was the Sword Emperor. So even if someone else gave themselves the title of ‘Sword Emperor’, no one would even give a shit about you.

Looking at it again, the old sect master might not really be conceited. He felt he could no longer preserve his title of ‘Sword Emperor’ and wanted to resolve it as a swordsman, relying on the sword in his hand and not the sect.

If he didn’t accept Yu Qingfeng’s challenge, everyone would think he was afraid of Yu Qingfeng and still lose his title. So it might really be what the Dragon Origin Great Saint said, the old sect master chose to accept the challenge, despite knowing that he would die, and this was his pride as a swordsman. But before his death, he was still thinking about the Emperor Sword.

It was no wonder why the old sect master could say that everyone was mediocre in his eyes. This was because he was qualified to do so.

“I have decided to nurture you into a Sword Emperor!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint said, looking at Lin Yun with a grave expression.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned after hearing what the Dragon Origin Great Saint said before he smiled, “So that I’ll be hacked to death by Yu Qingfeng with one sword?”

“Why can’t you have any ambitions? I have already declared it back on the Heavenly Dao Altar, not to mention the old sect master only lacked the Emperor Sword. If you have the Emperor Sword, it’ll be a different story about who’ll hack who.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint unhappily looked at Lin Yun.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched because the Dragon Origin Great Saint made it sound like the difference between him and Yu Qingfeng was one Emperor Sword.

Moreover, what would he hack Yu Qingfeng for?

“But there’s one problem left…” The Dragon Origin Great Saint looked at Lin Yun and asked, “Who the hell are you? What is your true identity?”

After hearing that, Lin Yun instantly knew that this was the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s true motive, his identity.
