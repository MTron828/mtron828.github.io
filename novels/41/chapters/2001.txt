Chapter 2002 - Killing and Death!

The Indigocloth Venerable stood on a grave dump in a green forest, looking at the fireworks in the sky. Not far away, Lil' Red was kept in a metal cage with the eight god generals watching.

Lil’ Red tried to escape with Bai Qingyu, but they were ultimately caught. After all, the eight god generals could fight a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase if they joined forces. Lil’ Red could easily leave if wanted to, but it stayed behind on purpose after recalling what Lin Yun said.

As for Bai Qingyu, she was locked up in a Demon-Locking Cage that was refined by the Blood Moon Sect. According to the Indigocloth Venerable, not even a Quasi-Saint could break it open. The Indigocloth Venerable released the rescue signal to lure Ye Qingtian over.

“Oh, kitty, how long do you think it will take Ye Qingtian to come?” The Indigocloth Venerable smiled.

“You want my big brother to come that much? You have no idea how much deep trouble you’re in. You can still survive if you let me go right now. My big brother isn’t someone you can provoke with your strength, “Lil’ Red said.

The Indigocloth Venerable smiled, “What a sharp tongue you have, and I’ll lock the three of you together later. Let me see if you still dare to say that then!”

When she finished, she unleashed an attack at Lil’ Red, causing it to scream out from the pain.

“You wait! I’ll tear you into pieces when I get out!” Lil’ Red cursed.

“You still want to get out? I’ll only let you out when you decide to become my pet,” the Indigocloth Venerable smiled. Her hands gently formed into lightning ropes, making Lil' Red scream in pain.

On the other hand, Bai Qingyu was powerlessly in the cage. When she saw this scene, she begged, “It’s only a cat! There’s no need to torture it in this manner.”

The Indigocloth Venerable stopped and smiled, “Haha. It’s not an ordinary cat. Even the eight god generals nearly lost to it, and I nearly lost my life. The cat is much stronger than you, the Bai Clan’s young missy. But I’ll spare it for now if you listen to me.”

Bai Qingyu gritted her teeth. Her face was pale, and she was weak. Her dragon pulses were damaged, and she was injured when they tried to escape. So she was extremely weak.

“Don’t die here because I still have use for your life,” the Indigocloth Venerable said.

Suddenly, the faces of the eight god generals changed because they could hear some commotion. The Indigocloth Venerable grabbed Bai Qingyu and leaped on a tree before smiling, “Ye Qingtian really came!”

The eight god generals quickly prepared, standing beneath the tree, and activated the Nethermoon Saint Armor. As crimson flames ignited from their armors, their aura became terrifying, like eight statues. Not long later, Ye Qingtian appeared before their eyes.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re really slow. I would have lost my patience if you didn’t come soon,” the Indigocloth Venerable smiled.

Lin Yun raised his head and frowned, “I have no feud with your Blood Moon Sect. Let her go, and I can consider this never happened.”

“That’s for me to decide. Tell me your true objective in the Myriad Graves Valley and your identity!” The Indigocloth Venerable smiled.

Lin Yun’s face sank because he thought Xiao Jingyan would be the one capturing Bai Qingyu. He never expected it to be the Blood Moon Sect. A cold murderous intent flashed within his pupils, and he said, “I advise you to let her go. This is my last warning and your last chance.”

The Indigocloth Venerable smiled, “Ye Qingtian, do you really think you’re a figure? Even those in the top thirty on the King Ranking don’t dare to be so cocky before me. Do you think that I’m a god general?”

“Is that so?” Lin Yun raised his head and activated the Flower Burial Sword, unleashing an arc. It was too fast, and it disappeared with a flash before piercing through the heart of a god general. The Nethermoon Saint Armor wasn’t able to block his attack at all. As blood gushed out from the mouth of the god general, his face became pale, and he lowered his head to look at his chest with shock.

“H-How is this possible…?” That god general collapsed on the ground. The Nethermoon Saint Armor’s damage was slowly recovering, but he was already dead.

This instantly shocked the Indigocloth Venerable and the remaining god generals, looking at Ye Qingtian with disbelief. The Nethermoon Saint Armor wasn’t only tough, it contained the power of all the past god generals. It was a special Glory Saint Artifact, and even Saint Realm experts wouldn’t dare to face them head-on when three thousand god generals reigned the Kunlun Realm.

But they didn’t know that even if the Nethermoon Saint Armor was strong, it couldn’t be compared to the Flower Burial Sword. The Flower Burial Sword was a Glory Saint Artifact, and it was connected to him. So it wasn’t tough to pierce through other Glory Saint Artifacts.

Lin Yun reached out, and the Flower Burial Sword returned to his hand. He said, “Release them. I have no time to waste with you.”

The Indigocloth Venerable was briefly shocked before she grabbed Bai Qingyu’s neck and smiled, “Ye Qingtian, you don’t feel any heartache for such a beauty? You already saved her twice. I don’t believe that you dare to watch her die just like that in my hands. Kneel before me!”

Lin Yun shook his head and said, “It looks like you still don’t know your current situation. I’m not asking you to release he, but giving you a path.”

When he waved his hand, the Flower Burial Sword flew out.

“Stop him!” The Indigocloth Venerable’s face changed, wanting to snap Bai Qingyu’s neck.

As the Flower Burial Sword danced, the remaining seven god generals were stopped. At the same time, Lin Yun came behind the Indigocloth Venerable without anyone knowing it, and thrust his fingers at the Indigocloth Venerable’s forehead.

This instantly made the Indigocloth Venerable panic and she released her grip on Bai Qingyu. She didn’t want to die with Bai Qingyu, so she quickly retreated, wanting to put distance between her and Ye Qingtian.

Lin Yun had no expression as he dragged Bai Qingyu into his embrace before grabbing the Indigocloth Venerable by her shoulder. All the nirvana aura within his body poured out from his pores, forming a Heavenly Dragon and a Divine Phoenix around him that made him look like a deity.

When Lin Yun grabbed the Indigocloth Venerable’s shoulder, she was horrified to discover that she couldn’t break free and couldn’t figure out how Ye Qingtian became so strong. It had just been a few days, so he could now suppress her with his cultivation? This was too unbelievable.

When they fought, the Indigocloth Venerable discovered she couldn’t resist Ye Qingtian. Bai Qingyu’s face was sickly red in Lin Yun’s embrace. This was because her body was too weak. Her injuries had recovered a little with the help of saint pellets, but she was further injured when Lil’ Red was trying to escape with her, and she couldn’t muster any strength because of her dragon pulses.

“Kneel!”

The Indigocloth Venerable still wanted to struggle, but a powerful force pressed down on her shoulder.

The Indigocloth Venerable was forced down on her knees. With a hint of reluctance in her pupils, she soon made a decision. Her body became soft, as though she had no bones.

When Lin Yun reached out to grab her, he only grabbed onto a piece of clothing.

The Indigocloth Venerable was naked while standing in the Demon-Locking Cage. She casually took out a robe to wear it and smiled, “Ye Qingtian, you could’ve just told me if you wanted me to strip. There’s no need to be so troublesome.”

The seven god generals retreated, making the Indigocloth Venerable feel safe.

Lin Yun reached out and grabbed the Flower Burial Sword. Glancing at Lil’ Red in the cage, he said, “Lil’ Red, stop playing around.”

Lil' Red grinned and reached out with its paws. As crimson lightning enveloped its body, a colossal Ancient Dracoape appeared, causing the Demon-Locking Cage to burst apart, and the Indigocloth Venerable was sent flying away with a palm.

The Indigocloth Venerable clashed against a towering tree, blood dripping down her lips. Her hair was disheveled, and the seven god generals quickly came forth, nervously protecting the Indigocloth Venerable.

“Ye Qingtian, I-I’m probably going to die. You’re really good to me, and no one has treated me so well besides my elder sister…” Bai Qingyu’s face was pale as she said softly, “I really regret it… I should’ve listened to you. I-I’m sorry…”

“The Blood Moon Sect is more useless than I’ve imagined.” Xiao Jingyan walked out from the dark along with the remaining experts of the various clans.

When the Indigocloth Venerable saw Xiao Jingyan, her eyes lit up. She said, “Xiao Jingyan, kill Ye Qingtian. The holy maiden will remember your help!”

“Do I need her to remember my help? Behave yourself! I’ll deal with you later!” Xiao Jingyan said.

The Indigocloth Venerable casually smiled, “As long as you kill Ye Qingtian, you can do whatever you want with me.”

As the nirvana aura gushed out from Xiao Jingyan’s body, he was enveloped by the demonic radiance that made him look sinister. He brought ten-odd remaining Nirvana Stage experts with him, soaring to the sky, charging at Ye Qingtian, “Go at him together! Kill him to take revenge for Ye Qinghong and Zhang Kui!”

Lin Yun’s heart was calm while facing them. He took a deep breath and tightened his grip on the Flower Burial Sword, before swinging it. A dazzling sword ray fell before Lin Yun, which looked like the first gleam of light in the world.

“You want to use the same move again?” Xiao Jingyan’s pupils flashed with disdain when he saw Ye Qingtian using the Sword of the Beginning.

When the sword ray bloomed, Xiao Jingyan and the experts that came with him wanted to retreat. However, they realized they couldn’t leave, even if they wanted to, and they were dragged into the sword ray with the surrounding space being distorted. When they were spat out from the distorted space, they collapsed onto the ground.

Aside from Xiao Jingyan, everyone else was dead and was torn into pieces. Even Xiao Jingyan had lost an arm and was covered in blood. His wounds even went as deep as his bones.

“H-How is this possible?!” Xiao Jingyan trembled in fear.

The Indigocloth Venerable was also shocked when she saw this scene and couldn’t believe what she saw. Ye Qingtian only used one sword to inflict heavy injuries on Xiao Jingyan and killed ten-odd Nirvana Stage experts.

“Quickly execute ‘Sacrifice’!” The Indigocloth Venerable panicked.

The seven god generals immediately sat down and began reciting from their lips, their auras declining.

“Sacred flames ignite my body and free me from pain with death. Blood moon, I’m willing to use my blood to honor my ancestors…”

At the same time, Xiao Jingyan also opened up the vertical eye on his forehead and brought out his Demonspirit’s physique. As his bones wriggled, his body swelled up, and the vertical eye looked even more terrifying.

The seven god generals were enveloped in flames as they joined Xiao Jingyan, slowly approaching Ye Qingtian.

Lin Yun placed Bai Qingyu down and said, “Sleep for now. I’ll save you after killing them all.”

Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword and looked at the approaching Xiao Jingyan and the god generals. These people should all be killed, so he dashed forth, wanting to make a bloodbath with these people.

He soared to the sky and circulated the Flower Burial Sword, charging at the seven god generals. He suddenly appeared within the seven of them, circulating the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, and unleashed his sword intent, killing the god generals with a sword each.

It didn’t take long for the ground to be covered in corpses. But Lin Yun frowned because Xiao Jingyan dashed over when he killed all the god generals.

Xiao Jingyan grabbed this opportunity and had no intentions of concealing his strength. He immediately brought out his constellation, bringing out half of the Stalewater Sword’s power with his Demonspirit’s physique. The power of this sword reached a height that he would be afraid of, not to mention he resorted to a sneak attack. He didn’t believe that he couldn’t inflict heavy injuries on Ye Qingtian in this manner.

Lin Yun suddenly turned around and swung his sword, knocking the Stalewater Sword away and plunging it into an ancient tree. At the same time, Xiao Jingyan threw out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying by the sword intent.

“Astral Sword Intent!” Xiao Jingyan was shocked, looking at Ye Qingtian. He was completely dumbfounded when he saw Ye Qingtian’s forehead shining like stars, and his sword intent reached an unbelievable height. When the massive sword intent was released, Xiao Jingyan was quickly sent flying away.

Xiao Jingyan was shocked because even if Ye Qingtian made a breakthrough, it made no sense for him to be so powerful.

“W-Who the hell are you?!” Xiao Jingyan felt afraid for the first time as he trembled.

Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword with blood dripping down his sword. He said, “I’m Flower Burial, someone who buries flowers and people alike.”

Xiao Jingyan widened his mouth with his pupils narrowing. Even the Indigocloth Venerable was dumbfounded, wondering if she had heard Lin Yun incorrectly.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
