Chapter 678 - Nine Lightning Tribulation, Radiant Sword Ray!

The territory was filled with an ominous aura, forcing Lin Yun to travel carefully. Beneath the hill was a boundless plain and a colossal demonic beast of nearly three hundred meters.

Looking at this demonic beast, Lin Yun instantly narrowed his eyes as he could sense his heart beating wildly. The demonic beast was giving him huge pressure, so he could imagine how immense the pressure would be if he got close to it. Just what kind of demonic beast was this?

It’s upper body was three hundred meters long with an emerald color and two dragon wings that were folded together. As for its lower body, it had two grey claw-like legs and a tail that was a few hundred meters dragon long.

Around the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture, there was rumbling lighting. This was the Heavenly Soul Realm overlord demonic beast that contained the dragon bloodline. No wonder Luo Yu said that it could kill him with a stare.

Encountering such an existence could kill Lin Yun even before he could react. It would be a question if he could even budge before he was killed.

Lin Yun was greatly shocked as he took a deep breath to calm his emotions. From the terrifying demonic beast, there was a violent aura rippling out that symbolized it was a genuine overlord. Even when the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was resting, lightning flickered in the air because of its breathing.

If he took another step forward, he would step into the demonic beast’s senses, alarming it despite the fact that he and Lil’ Red were like worms in its eyes. Perhaps it would look at them in disdain before going back to sleep, but it might also attack them.

This was a gamble that no one dared to take, not even Lin Yun. He retrieved a jade bottle. Inside the bottle was a medicinal powder that could temporarily hide his aura from the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

But this powder also had a huge flaw in that he couldn’t get too close. Additionally, there couldn’t be any fluctuations to his emotion, breathing, or killing aura.

After applying the powder on Lil’ Red and himself, Lin Yun glanced at Lil’ Red to give it a signal. Lil’ Red’s legs were trembling with fear. But in the end, it still went forward although it kept looking back every three steps.

Suddenly, the sleeping Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture opened one eye and glanced at Lil’ Red. This made Lil’ Red terrified and it fell to the ground. But the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture merely glanced at Lil’ Red before closing its eyes again.

But after a while, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture opened its eyes again. This startled Lil’ Red greatly as it turned around and started running away. But in the end, Lil’ Red stumbled and began rolling on the ground.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture opened its eyes forcibly and looked at Lil’ Red with curiosity. It was wondering what this idiot whose bloodline made it feel amicable was doing.

When Lil’ Red got back up and saw the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture staring at it, it began to tremble in fear before quickly moving in another direction. But no matter where it went, it noticed that the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was still staring.

Lil’ Red was thinking that it was finished before it ran off with its head lowered. This made the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture even more curious, wondering what was going on. Did it go insane?

Right at this moment, Lil’ Red suddenly unleashed a burst of strength and disappeared from the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s eyesight. When Lil’ Red reappeared, it was behind the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture with a ferocious cold light flashing through its pupils.

With crimson lightning flickering on its hooves, Lil’ Red shot through the air and trampled on the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s butt. With an unbelievable force, Lil’ Red’s hooves left large scorches on the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s butt, sending the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture rolling forward.

With another gust of wind, Lil’ Red appeared before the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture and showed a goofy smile that revealed its buck teeth.

This made the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture enraged as it unleashed a ferocious roar, causing thunderclouds to gather in the sky. As lightning rumbled in the sky, the entire region looked like the apocalypse was coming. After Lil’ Red chuckled, it immediately sped off.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture unfolded its wings and its massive figure soared into the sky.

Up on the hill, Lin Yun squinted his eyes as he could barely keep his footing against the violent wind. It took a long time for the violent wind to calm down.

Seeing that the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was lured away, Lin Yun spread his arms apart and stepped into the core of this region. The plains were filled with bones. Aside from the bones of the demonic beasts, there were also many bones that belonged to human cultivators that filled this region with a murderous aura.

Aside from the killing aura, there was also a dense blood stench that mixed together with the resentful aura.

When Lin Yun entered the core region, it was difficult for him to take steps through the resentful aura. He couldn’t imagine how many demonic beasts and cultivators died to the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

Looking at the boundless pile of bones, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with shock. He now knew why no one dared to provoke this Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture. Taking a step forward to a spot ten miles away, the scenery around Lin Yun changed. This place was filled with vitality and spiritual energy, along with many rare fruits.

Just by taking a deep breath, Lin Yun could sense the boundless spiritual energy flowing into his body. This place was truly worthy of being an overlord demonic beast’s territory.

But Lin Yun had merely glanced at those fruits before he turned his gaze away forcibly. Not long later, a pool of blood appeared before him, which made his eyes light up before darkening.

He could sense the ominous aura coming from it, but it didn’t have a trace of a dragon bloodline. Clearly, this was a pool made of demonic beasts’ blood. According to Lin Yun’s best guess, this was probably for newborn demonic beasts to get through their weak states.

If a demonic cultivator was here, he or she would definitely jump in without hesitation. But it was of no temptation to Lin Yun because the ominous aura was too dense. There was no way he could cleanse himself of it.

“It should be somewhere nearby,” said Lin Yun as he continued forward. It didn’t take long for him to arrive before a cave. The cave was filled with restrictions in its surroundings. Although the restrictions were secretive, they were rather crudely done. Then again, it made sense as the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture did not study spiritual runes and had merely set up these restrictions relying on its talent.

But it was already enough because no one would dare to come here, excluding Lin Yun. In the cave, there were three glittering ‘gems’ filled with dense vitality.

“Found it.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with joy as he took out the best one without activating the restrictions. They weren’t gems, but the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s eggs. But it was crucial for Lin Yun to obtain the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s blood essence, so he didn’t have a choice.

Very quickly, Lin Yun left the cave without hesitation. He knew that the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture would fly into a rage if it noticed that an egg was missing.

An hour later, Lin Yun was standing on a tree catching his breath. But just when he was about to leave, he suddenly locked his brows together as there was a powerful sword intent coming from afar.

This made Lin Yun’s heart throb. His xiantian sword intent was already in complete mastery, so what kind of sword intent could be up ahead?

“Haha, looks like it’s going to be successful.”

“Thirty years ago, the Ironblood Sword Gate planted the seed of an Imperial Sword Herb and now it’s finally going to mature.”

“The expert who fought the Flame Dragon back then was truly terrifying. The sword intent is actually still lingering after a millennium had passed.”

“If the young master refines this Imperial Sword Herb, his sword intent will probably reach greater mastery or even complete mastery. He will definitely shine brightly during the Draconic Banquet!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“This seed is nourished with the sword intent of that expert. It might even allow the young master to break through the xiantian sword intent,” said a few Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples as they passed by the tree Lin Yun was standing on.

Lin Yun had restricted his aura to prevent detection and he only showed himself when the group of disciples left. Looking at the origin of the fluctuation again, Lin Yun fell into deep thought. So it turns out that the expert who fought the Flame Dragon was a peerless swordsman.

Just what kind of sword intent could linger even after a millennium? When curiosity was planted in Lin Yun’s heart, it ate him up. Calculating the time, he should be able to go take a look.

After a brief moment of pondering, Lin Yun made his decision to go and take a look. Immediately, he moved out and headed towards the direction of the sword intent.

But ten minutes later, Lin Yun suddenly felt a stinging pain in his eyes. When he recovered his sight, he carefully opened his eyes to look up ahead and saw a sword hovering in the sky that was shrouded in lightning.

It emitted a boundless sword intent that radiated through the sky. This caused a huge shock in Lin Yun’s heart as he had no idea if this was a genuine sword. That sword was formed with a sword intent that he couldn’t see through, containing the undying sword intent from the swordsman a millennia ago.
