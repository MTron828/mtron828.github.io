Chapter 1585 - Lord Lin, Got It!

“I advise you to consider well before drawing your sword!” Mo Yun coldly said, seeing Lin Yun grabbing onto his sword. He was afraid of Lin Yun’s strength and was also trying to drag for time. Although Lin Yun only seemed to be at the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, Mo Yun didn’t dare to look down on him and was even nervous.

But he was confident in his own saint diagrams, so he continued, “Within each of these thirty-six saint diagrams, there is a thousand-rune saint diagram, created with ten thousand fourth-grade spiritual runes. So every single one is a fifth-grade spiritual array, and thirty-six saint diagrams means thirty-six spiritual arrays, and they’re all connected.”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

As he spoke, the saint diagrams hovering around him opened and intertwined, forming a highly profound spiritual array. When the spiritual array’s aura was unleashed, Mo Yun could unleash a devastating might with a wave of his hand.

Simultaneously, two people were approaching from afar, releasing terrifying auras. One was radiating with startling vitality like an actual dragon. As a draconic roar echoed across the sky, this person was like a true dragon in this world.

“Xiao Yun, grab your pet and get lost!” Mo Yun said with his eyes becoming colder. The two approaching people gave him confidence, and he wanted to save Dong An by threatening Lin Yun.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun finally drew his sword when his aura was accumulated to the limit. Along with a ferocious roar, he drew his sword, and his sword ray lit up a hundred miles of radius. As his sword vibration echoed, Lin Yun suddenly disappeared.

This made Mo Yun squint his eyes because Lin Yun had passed through the thirty-six saint diagrams when Lin Yun reappeared. Mo Yun felt puzzled because he was sure that even if Lin Yun had a powerful physique, there was no doubt that he would die under the explosion of the thirty-six saint diagrams. He believed that Lin Yun had keen senses as a swordsman, and he should be able to sense them.

But Lin Yun had no intention of withdrawing his sword. When a wisp of black sword aura appeared on the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun pushed the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to the limit and his sword moved like a brush. His slashes were like ink tearing the saint diagrams apart whenever he swung his sword.

When the terrifying corrosive power reached those saint diagrams, the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra had perfectly fused with the Desolation Sword Form. The erosive ability swiftly eroded the saint runes like rust spreading on metal.

After Lin Yun swung nine swords, the thirty-six saint diagrams were all torn apart and an ancient ‘Desolation’ word appeared, descending from the sky. When the sword plunged into the ground, the ancient ‘Desolation’ word fell on this region along with the sword tip. The thirty-six saint diagrams were swiftly eroded before they could unleash their power.

“How is this possible?!” Mo Yun was shocked when looking at this scene.

Not giving him time to be shocked, Lin Yun executed the Diving Sunchasing Art and flashed like a bright sun. Balling his hand into a fist, he punched Mo Yun in the chest. His punch shattered the seven layers of spiritual arrays on Mo Yun, and even fine cracks appeared on his saint armor.

Throwing out a mouthful of blood, Mo Yun was sent flying away, his face pale. Just when Lin Yun wanted to chase after him, light bloomed where Mo Yun initially stood. The light bloomed like a flower that instantly spread throughout this region, sealing off Lin Yun within as the flower began to close up.

“Death to anyone who dares to humiliate my Sword Sect!” Lin Yun was hindered, but his heart to kill wasn’t obstructed at all. As his hands formed into a seal, the Flower Burial Sword began to vibrate with an explosively terrifying killing intent. That killing intent turned the sky into a blood ocean as Lin Yun swept his finger across the air.

“Damn it!” Mo Yun was startled. He was planning to kill Lin Yun in that flower, but the sword flying over made him feel significantly threatened, and he couldn’t avoid it; it was as though his movements were all predicted by Lin Yun.

This sword was aimed at his life. When he felt he would die, a robust figure descended, throwing a punch and knocking the Flower Burial Sword away. Meanwhile, Lin Yun broke free from the flower. Countless saint runes had been shattered while he rose into the air.

“Jiang Tong!” Chen Ling, who hid behind the Demonic Rune Tiger, had changed his expression when he saw this person. He quickly warned, “Senior Brother Lin, he’s Jiang Tong, who was once on the Inner Ranking. He’s a genius in the Golden Generation!”

“Junior Brother Lin? So it’s you!” Jiang Tong smiled; It’s no wonder why Lin Yun felt so familiar. It turned out that Xiao Yun was a fake name, and this person was Lin Yun of the Sword Sect.

When Jiang Tong looked at Lin Yun, his pupils blazed with flames. If he could kill this person, he might be able to return to the Profound Sky Sect and be forgiven for what he did in the past.

“Big Brother, be careful. There’s something weird about this person.” Mo Yun said with fear lingering in his tone. Simultaneously, bone flute music echoed, giving Lil’ Red a headache. It felt like needles were stabbed into its mind, and this attack completely disregarded Lil’ Red’s physical body.

After Lil’ Red took the Dracoape’s form, it was practically invincible. But it was releasing a painful howl at the location where the music came from. The sound wave created by the roar left ripples in the surroundings, but it couldn’t defeat that flute music. Soon after, Lil’ Red fell to the ground and was in great pain as it rolled over the ground.

Lin Yun’s face changed when he saw this scene, but a sun bloomed behind Jiang Tong as he dashed towards Lin Yun, “Ha, you should take care of yourself, first!”

Raising his hand, Jiang Tong unleashed countless punches that rained down towards Lin Yun.

In response, Lin Yun circulated the fifty thousand-foot wide dragon origin ocean and clashed with Jiang Tong head-on. Whenever he threw his punch out, his sword aura would rise frantically, and Lin Yun could feel his internal organs shaking with every clash, and the dragon runes on his body kept shattering.

He instantly knew that Jiang Tong’s dragon origin was stronger than his, which surprised Lin Yun. But that was natural, since Jiang Tong was two stages higher than him in terms of cultivation. The reason why Lin Yun was able to defeat Luo Yuan was thanks to his trump cards that could eradicate the difference between them.

Facing an expert at the pinnacle third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, the difference immediately appeared, and he would be dead if the Blue Dragon Bone didn’t keep producing dragon runes. Letting out a roar, an ancient cauldron rose from the dragon origin ocean, and a destructive energy filled his body. The heavenly dragon engraved on the cauldron lit up brightly.

“Lesser Heavenly Sun!” Jiang Tong circulated his Profound Sky Canon and the sun behind him began to revolve. They were close to the pinnacle as they clashed head-on with their punches, looking like two colliding bright suns.

The shockwave from their attacks swept all the towering trees within a hundred miles. A dazzling light pillar pierced through the heavy haze in the Withered Mountain Range, alarming countless demonic beasts in the surroundings into running. Many people also discovered this terrifying phenomenon and turned their attention over.

When everything settled down, Lin Yun took ten steps back with blood dripping from his lip. On the other hand, Jiang Tong only took three steps back, and the sun revolving behind him had dimmed down. Jiang Tong instantly realized Mo Yun wasn’t lying. Lin Yun was like a monster. He was only at the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, but he could actually clash with him head-on.

One must know that each pulse in the Dragon Pulse Realm had a drastic difference, and it wasn’t easy to eliminate the disparities by relying on foundation and talent alone.

“Someone’s here…” Mo Yun became cautious as he looked around. The youth playing the bone flute gently landed beside Jiang Tong, and he also became cautious.

Taking this opportunity, Lin Yun gave the Demonic Rune Tiger a signal with his eye. The Demonic Rune Tiger instantly knew what Lin Yun was telling him and returned to its tiger form. Then it grabbed a hold of Chen Ling, and sped off before anyone could respond.

“Lil’ Red, come back.” Lin Yun called out and the Dracoape transformed into a cat, before landing on Lin Yun’s shoulder. It glared at the youth who played the bone flute.

This scene also surprised the youth who played the bone flute because he didn’t expect this Dracoape to have two forms. Just when Jiang Tong and that youth were hesitating if they should continue to deal with Lin Yun or if they should be wary of those hidden in the surroundings, Lin Yun suddenly let out a roar, “Mo Yun!”

His roar made Mo Yun subconsciously turn to look at Lin Yun, and Lin Yun used this opportunity to activate the Divine Dragon Eyes. Raising his head, a sun and a moon appeared within his pupils and the divine dragon aura overlapped.

As wisps of flames revolved, he empowered the Blue Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal, and White Dragon Seal into his Divine Dragon Eyes. With just a glance, Mo Yun’s head blew apart, and even all his spiritual arrays failed to protect him.

This startled the bone flute youth and Jiang Tong because they couldn’t respond quickly enough.

“Rebel of the Profound Sky Sect, we’ll meet again!” Lin Yun laughed as the Golden Crow Wings appeared behind him, and the Flower Burial Sword returned to his hand.

“Damn it!” Jiang Tong flew into a rage because he was fooled, and his face became eerie.

“Dong An is also dead…” The bone flute youth said, looking at Dong An’s tragic death. Dong An was smashed to death by Lil’ Red, which meant that all his bones had shattered.

Noticing more people approaching, Jiang Tong swiftly decided, “Let’s go!”

The Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood was more important to him. Before he obtained the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood, he didn’t want to start a fight with these people. However, he just couldn’t calm the rage within his heart.
