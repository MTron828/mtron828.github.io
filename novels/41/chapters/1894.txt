Chapter 1895 - An Eye For An Eye

“Who the hell are you? There are not that many disciples within the Heavenly Dao Sect who possess Glory Saint Artifacts, and I should know all of them!” Zhang Yue’s facial expression gradually became solemn as he stared at Lin Yun.

“To dare to lure me out under Bai Shuying, you must be a saint’s disciple. Are you from the Heavenly Yin Palace? The nine upper peaks? Or the Nether Orchid Courtyard?” Zhang Yue stared at Lin Yun. “If you can’t kill me today, I won’t let you off if I manage to find out who you are in the future!”

“It’s okay. You can carry on and try to buy time. I have plenty of time to play with you today,” Lin Yun said.

Zhang Yue took a deep breath to calm himself down after having his intention exposed, His pale face became a little rosier, and he looked around before he smiled, “I never expected that there’s someone within the Heavenly Dao Sect who dared to fool me. Don’t tell me you think you’re invincible with a Glory Saint Artifact? Or do you think only you possess a Glory Saint Artifact?”

As he spoke, a sword appeared in his hand. When Zhang Yue held onto the sword, the glory spirit was activated, and a powerful aura swept out from him. But that wasn’t all; his aura rose to the third transformation of the Nirvana Stage before stopping. A powerful nirvana aura filled his body, bringing the pressure he gave off to a new height.

“You dare mess around with me?!” Zhang Yue’s smile disappeared, replaced by a dark expression. “How dare you mess with me by using Bai Shuying’s name. Let me see who you are!”

His pupils were blazing with flames. His hopes were high earlier, and it felt like he had fallen from the sky. In the next second, a terrifying murderous intent swept out from him. Regardless of his identity, he was determined to make this person before him pay the price. But before Zhang Yue could reach Lin Yun, a black figure appeared before him.

“A cat?” Zhang Yue squinted his pupils, and his sword was sent flying away before he could comprehend what was happening. The sword plunged into a rock, but what shocked Zhang Yue came next. The black cat grew in size.

In the next second, it turned into an Ancient Dracoape that was nearly a hundred feet in height, and releasing the pressure of the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. With a gentle wave of its hand, Zhang Yue was sent flying away, and the nirvana aura enveloping him swiftly collapsed. He couldn’t even withstand a hit from the Ancient Dracoape.

“Ancient Dracoape! What the hell is this? Why is there something like this within the Heavenly Dao Sect?!” Zhang Yue coughed, and he was dumbfounded because this had surpassed his understanding. He bumped into a little girl when he turned around and wanted to flee. He naturally wouldn’t treat her seriously and roared, wanting to push her away, “Get lost!”

But he realized she didn’t move when he pushed her, and he was sent flying away instead. This made him throw another mouthful of blood, and Zhang Yue was heavily injured. As he watched the little girl slowly getting closer, he could feel a chill run down his spine and wondered where this monster had come from.

Zhang Yue immediately took out a talisman and threw it out. But when the talisman flew out, it bumped into a spiritual array, and the talisman became invalid.

“How is this possible?!” Zhang Yue fell into despair because the talisman was meant to seek help from the Dao Yang Palace.

“Futile attempts. No matter what happens today, no one can save you,” Lin Yun said.

Zhang Yue tried to spread his senses, but he discovered that his senses rebounded after reaching a specific range. Most importantly, his nirvana aura was dispersed by the Ancient Dracoape, and the backlash from the earlier push damaged his meridians. He was already rendered powerless after several exchanges, which was too terrifying.

“Who the hell are you?! I believe we don’t have any feud!” Zhang Yue gritted his teeth, looking at Lin Yun.

“Sorry, but we have a huge feud between us.” Lin Yun plucked a tree branch off the tree and lashed it against Zhang Yue’s face. This instantly left a bloody gnash on Zhang Yue, causing him to scream and roll on the ground.

But Lin Yun didn’t take any pity on him and continued to use the tree branch as a whip against Zhang Yue’s body. In a brief moment, Zhang Yue was already covered in blood, and his clothes were dyed in his own blood. But none of the wounds were fatal, and each strike only made Zhang Yue feel pain.

“Stop… Stop…” Zhang Yue could only cover his head and roll on the ground, sobbing. He had never suffered such humiliation and torture before in his lifetime.

Lin Yun was decisive, and he wouldn’t swing his sword again if he could take his opponent's life with one swing. But Zhang Yue wasn’t worthy of him drawing his sword.

“Does it hurt? I’m only paying you back for how you humiliated Ye Qingtian back then. Have you never thought that you would experience this one day?” Lin Yun roared, and he gave Zhang Yue another lash. The actual Ye Qingtian was dead. So even if Zhang Yue didn’t insult Ye Xinyan today, Lin Yun would still take revenge for Ye Qingtian since he was using the latter’s identity.

“You’re Ye Qingtian?! No, you’re not Ye Qingtian…” Zhang Yue was briefly alarmed before he denied it. He refused to believe that Ye Qingtian dared to do this to him, but what replied to him was another lash from Lin Yun.

Without any expression, Lin Yun gave Zhang Yue a hundred more lashes. Lin Yun would awaken Zhang Yue with another lash whenever he was about to faint.

“You madman. Just kill me… kill me…” Zhang Yue wailed.

“You don’t have to worry because I won’t take your life.” Lin Yun gave Zhang Yue another lash, and the tree branch in his hand broke. However, Zhang Yue couldn’t take the pain any longer and fainted.

“Is he dead?” Lil’ Purple came over and kicked Zhang Yue.

“Not yet,” Lin Yun replied.

“What should we do now? Leave him here?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“It’ll be too easy on him this way. Doesn’t he like to look at others becoming a joke? After today, he’ll become the biggest joke of the Heavenly Dao Sect,” Lin Yun said. He already had plans on how to deal with this person.

“Let’s bring him to the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s gate, first,” Lin Yun lifted Zhang Yue and left with Lil’ Purple quickly following after him. Lil’ Purple had no idea what Lin Yun was planning.

When they arrived before the Profound Maiden Courtyard, Lin Yun found a tree and said, “Turn around. Don’t look.”

“I want to see how you will deal with him!!” Lil’ Purple said. But her face soon blushed because Lin Yun stripped Zhang Yue naked.

“You’re disgusting.” Lil’ Purple quickly closed her eyes but left a small gap open.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lin Yun took some rope and tied Zhang Yue’s hands up before hanging him on the tree.

At this moment, Lil’ Purple finally knew what Lin Yun was trying to do, and she smiled, “You’re nasty. This is worse than killing him, and he’ll become the biggest joke within the Heavenly Dao Sect tomorrow.”

But that wasn’t all, Lin Yun then took a brush and pondered what to write on Zhang Yue’s back.

I’m sinful, and I shouldn’t have peeked on…

Lin Yun initially planned to write the Serene Dust Great Saint, but it didn’t seem appropriate.

“I’m sorry about this,” Lin Yun muttered, and he continued to write:

I’m sinful, and I shouldn’t have peeked on the Dragon Origin Great Saint showering.

This immediately made Lil’ Purple laugh, and she continued, “Hahaha! You’re nasty!”

There was nothing Lin Yun could do about it because he didn’t know many Saint Elders and could only apologize to the Dragon Origin Great Saint in his heart.

“Hehe. Why don’t you guess what he’ll do to you if he knows about this?” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“I believe Master will forgive me,” Lin Yun said without any change on his face.

“Hmph, you’re a scumbag. Why are you calling him your ‘master’ now?” Lil’ Purple said with disdain on her face.

“Do you know any seals that even Quasi-Saints won’t be able to undo?” Lin Yun asked. He needed Zhang Yue to hang on the tree for as long as possible, or it wouldn’t achieve his desired effect.

“I do, but I can’t use them with my current cultivation. Even if I forcibly used them, Quasi-Saints could undo them.” Lil’ Purple helplessly spread her arms apart.

“That’s not enough.” Lin Yun shook his head. “There are too many Quasi-Saints within the Heavenly Dao Sect. Can you set up a seal that will cause his death if anyone tries to forcibly break it? This way, even Quasi-Saints won’t dare to undo the rope so easily.”

“That’s simple. But I realized that you’re really nasty!” Lil’ Purple smiled. Despite saying that, she wasn’t slow in her movements and was clearly having fun.

“Let’s go.”

“Hehe, there’s no need to hurry. I want to write something on him as well.” Lil’ Purple seized the brush and drew a tortoise on Zhang Yue’s face. When Zhang Yue wakes up tomorrow, he would probably want to die.

Once they were done, they left in satisfaction. But when they were about to return to the Indigo Thunder Peak, Lil’ Purple’s face suddenly changed, and she yelled, “Not good! We’ve been discovered!”

When she said that, Lin Yun sensed several figures bolting in his direction, and the one leading the group was a Quasi-Saint. They didn’t discover him with their senses but with their naked eyes.

“It’s the patroling elders. Quick, return to the Iris Secret Realm!” Lin Yun’s face changed, before he quickly turned in another direction and ran.

“Who dares to intrude on the Heavenly Dao Sect?!” That Quasi-Saint roared, and he pushed his palm forth.

A colossal palm soon appeared on the ground, and Lin Yun was blown away by a powerful shockwave when he tried to dodge it. Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to enter a forest and bolted for his life.

But that Quasi-Saint continued to pursue him, leveling all the trees and hills along the way. Soon, the commotion alarmed more Quasi-Saints, who soared to the sky and sealed off Lin Yun’s path.

The Heavenly Dao Sect was too terrifying, and Lin Yun could only run in the direction where there weren’t so many people. He only focused on running and didn’t even know where he was heading. So once he entered a quiet valley, he discovered that the pursuers behind him had slowed down. His first reaction was that he had intruded a forbidden ground, or those Quasi-Saints wouldn’t have slowed down.

“Back down!” A loud and indifferent voice echoed from the depths of the valley. This made all the Quasi-Saints throw out a mouthful of blood before retreating.

Lin Yun had no idea what was happening, but he didn’t dare to make a sound.

“They’re all gone now. So why aren’t you coming out?” A person walked out from the valley, indifferently looking at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun knew he was exposed and could only stand out. He wanted to see who this person was, but he could only see a rough outline and a terrifying aura being emitted from this person. The aura of this person was so terrifying that it froze his blood.

When Lin Yun was uneasy, that person said, “Ye Qingtian, is this how you visit me? Under disguise and pursued?”
