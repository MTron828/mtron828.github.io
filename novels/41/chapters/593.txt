Chapter 594 - Footsteps in the Darkness

Everyone knew about the Duskmist Flower, but who would look for them on purpose? Most of them would pick those flowers if they ran into them since they were considered a small harvest. After all, looking for those flowers on purpose would be a waste of time.

Ancient runes could be seen everywhere in the massive Withernorth Sea and there were many treasures here. It made no sense for them to look for Duskmist Flowers on purpose. So for a split second, the dozens who were attracted but the Flower Burial Sword were all furious.

They didn’t come here for the Duskmist Flowers, but for the empyrean’s tomb and treasures. Even if Lin Yun was strong and could defeat two greater Yang stage cultivators with a sword, there was nothing he could do if all of them wanted to leave.

“I’m sorry, but I don’t have the time to do that!”

“You think we’re all fools to look for the Duskmist Flowers for you for free?”

“You even want us to leave behind our interspatial pouches? Dream on!”

“Let’s just leave. There’s no need to bother with this guy.” After a few people took the lead, dozens of other people flew into the sky using their movement techniques to leave.

Waving his hand, Lin Yun began to form seals with his left hand and said, “Since you guys are here, don’t dream about leaving.”

It would be terrible if all of them left. After all, the Flower Burial Sword had to rely on their efforts. When Lin Yun was done forming seals with his left hand, a torrential killing aura instantly swept out and enveloped everyone. Those who were enveloped by Lin Yun’s killing aura instantly felt like they had plunged into a marsh since they had great difficulty moving.

“Damn it, what’s the matter?”

“We can’t move!”

“Damn it!” Everyone who tried to escape plunged into fear as they began to struggle. But Lin Yun didn’t give them any chance as he threw out a punch with the Seven Slaughtering Seal.

Those who tried to escape instantly suffered heavy injuries as they fell onto the ground while vomiting blood. As for the nearby buildings, all of them had been reduced to dust under Lin Yun’s punch.

When the dust settled, an azure-clothed youth was revealed as his dominating aura permeated the surroundings. He had only used one punch to heavily injure dozens of people.

The Seven Slaughtering Seal could multiply a person’s killing aura by seven times. This was an exponential increase of one to two, two to four, four to eight, and so on. So one could imagine how terrifying the killing aura would be after being multiplied, not to mention that Lin Yun also fused his xiantian sword intent into his punch.

However, Lin Yun had gone easy on them. If he attacked with full strength, then no one would have lived.

“I have the Duskmist Flowers!” The middle-aged man who was on his knees began to tremble after witnessing Lin Yun’s fist as he quickly retrieved three Duskmist Flowers.

“You can leave now,” said Lin Yun.

The middle-aged man immediately felt relief and quickly stood up to leave.

On the other hand, the youth in yellow clenched his teeth, “I only have one with me.”

“Leave your interspatial pouch behind. I’ll return it back to you after you come back with two more,” said Lin Yun as he took the yellowed-clothed youth’s interspatial pouch without any hesitation.

The youth was furious and roared, “You!”

“Hmmm?” Lin Yun turned to look at the youth in yellow, who instantly swallowed his words.

“I’ll look for them!” In the end, the youth in yellow could only swallow his rage. Right now, he wanted to find the Duskmist Flowers so he would never have to see Lin Yun again.

Once the two strongest cultivators were subdued, the rest obediently went to look for the Duskmist Flowers. In just two days, Lin Yun gathered nearly a hundred Duskmist Flowers.

Lin Yun opened up his sword box and placed the petals with four different colors into it. He could see the fragrance entering into the sword with his naked eyes.

“I should be able to promote it into a cosmic artifact before reaching the empyrean’s tomb now,” muttered Lin Yun with anticipation. If the Flower Burial Sword could be promoted, then it would go through a total transformation.

With a flash, Lin Yun disappeared from where he stood. He could see tattered buildings at the far end of the horizon. Although he had seen such similar scenes through many secret realms, he still couldn’t help being shocked whenever he saw it.

Just how glorious was the golden era? However, the huge tribulation left nothing except for tattered ruins as evidence of the glorious golden era.

Using the Seven Profound Steps, Lin Yun emitted a golden radiance as he traveled through the ruins like a golden crow. Along the way, he could see many sect disciples in the surroundings.

Occasionally, he could even hear fighting sounds. But Lin Yun simply ignored them as he continued his journey. But just when Lin Yun was about to leave this patch of ruins, Lin Yun’s face changed. He backtracked and arrived before a pile of rubble. The sand here was flowing slowly and one wouldn’t notice it if they didn’t pay any attention. According to his guess, this should lead to an underground palace.

Lin Yun waved his hand and brushed away the rubble to clear everything up. He could see the sand flowing down like a river and it wouldn’t take long for this hole to be closed up.

The Withernorth Sea itself was an ancient battlefield, so it wasn’t surprising for there to be an underground palace. Many treasures were found in underground palaces, but the dangers were also a lot greater. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lin Yun only hesitated for a brief moment before he jumped into the hole. When he entered, it felt like he was falling into an abyss. It felt like the small-scaled teleportation array that he had experienced in the past. He discovered that he was traveling somewhere far away.

Lin Yun was enveloped by the sand that led him through the underground palace. Currently, Lin Yun was feeling anxious and was also filled with anticipation.

After an unknown amount of time passed, Lin Yun finally stopped falling and landed on the ground. The Withernorth Sea was as bizarre as rumored and he had no idea where it would take him.

Looking around, Lin Yun noticed that he was somewhere dark. It was probably a manmade passageway. The two sides were made of tough walls that felt cold to the touch. It was a drastic contrast to the blazing Withernorth Sea itself.

At the same time, there was a small hole some distance away that flickered with a dull light. Not long later, Lin Yun found himself in a tattered stone chamber. The place had been ransacked by someone else as everything was left a mess.

Most importantly, he also found two corpses that didn’t look like they were from ancient times. Is someone else here?

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling disappointed. This meant that there wouldn’t be anything left here for him. But right at this moment, he could sense an origin energy fluctuation some distance away that signified an ongoing battle.

“Looks like there are quite a few people here…” Lin Yun couldn’t help being even more disappointed as he quietly pressed towards the battle. When he finally arrived inside a palace, he saw that there were gems on the ceiling that cast a gentle light onto the hall.

Under the light, he could see dozens of people fighting among themselves. In the corner of the hall, there was a stone pillar with a jade bowl on top of it. Glittering water was slowly dripping into the bowl. The sound of the water dripping down was refreshing and intoxicating.

When Lin Yun saw it, his eyes instantly lit up as he recognized it to be the Profound Yin Water. This explained why the palace was cool. Could it be that he was already in the empyrean’s tomb?

But that didn’t seem right as an empyrean’s tomb should have a frightening aura. This should only be the tomb of an ancient sect where they produced the Profound Yin Water. Although it might not be comparable to an empyrean’s tomb, this place also wasn’t simple.

“Get lost! I discovered the Profound Yin Water first! Don’t fight with me for it!”

“You think trash like you is qualified for it?”

“Die!” The group cursed at each other as they fought for the Profound Yin Water.

Lin Yun observed the situation in the dark before he turned to look at the jade bowl in deep thoughts. The fact that the jade bowl could resist the corrosion from the Profound Yin Water meant that the bowl itself was extraordinary, not to mention that it was flawless.

But just when Lin Yun was planning to fish for benefits in the dark, weak footsteps began to sound out from the darkness. The footsteps gradually overlapped with his heart beat. As the pace of the footsteps increased, the pace of his heartbeat also increased.

Lin Yun felt like his heart was about to leap out of his chest, but that wasn’t the most frightening part. When the footsteps came to a stop, his heartbeat had also stopped.

Then, his face turned pale and his breathing became quickened as he leaned onto the wall powerlessly. At the same time, those who were fighting in the hall also noticed that an expert had come.

With a grave expression, Lin Yun retracted his aura and didn’t dare to move carelessly. That person shouldn’t have noticed him. But even so, he was still shocked by the footsteps of that person. Just how strong is this person?

Lin Yun smiled bitterly as he realized that the Profound Yin Water was out of his grasp now.
