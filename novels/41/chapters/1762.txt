Chapter 1763 – Treasures

Neither Lin Yun nor Mu Xueling said a thing as they went down the mountain. A long time later, Mu Xueling asked, “You don’t seem disappointed.”

Lin Yun looked at Mu Xueling in surprise. He thought the latter cared about nothing in this world because even when she was walking beside him, she gave him a feeling that she was far beyond his reach. This was why Lin Yun was taken aback when Mu Xueling suddenly spoke out.

“Of course, I’m disappointed. I initially had great expectations for the Azure Dragon’s lineage, or I wouldn’t have made such a long journey to Heavenly Domain City or even indulged in music dao for so long.” Lin Yun replied. He gained a lot of harvest on the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Even if his dragon pulses were damaged and he couldn’t cultivate, if he spent the six months on sword dao, his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent might’ve reached greater mastery. Then again, that also meant his music dao wouldn’t be so strong now.

Mu Xueling calmly glanced at Lin Yun, but she didn’t like what Lin Yun said. Lin Yun considered himself a swordsman, and he sounded like learning music dao was just because he was forced to.

“You’re saying you’ve suffered grievances by practicing music dao?” Mu Xueling asked.

Sensing something wrong with her tone, Lin Yun replied, “Of course not. I have earned a lot, including two Three-Lives Fruit. They’re treasures that cannot be found anywhere else.”

“You don’t have to be so afraid of the Divine Dragon Empire. The Divine Dragon Empire might be strong, but they have a lot of enemies. The darkness suppressed back then is also showing signs of recovery. The Blood Moon Sect has been revived, and powerful enemies are in the southeast, north, and west. They’re at war throughout the year, and the Empress even has to personally fight many times!” Mu Xueling’s words stunned Lin Yun, and he wondered if she was trying to comfort him.

“Furthermore, everyone feels that the Radiant Sword Saint won’t be able to take that step out and will die. But what if he manages to take that step out? At that time, the Divine Dragon Empire will try to pull your master to their side, instead. Furthermore…” Mu Xueling raised her head forth, and she stopped walking.

“Furthermore, what?” Lin Yun asked.

“Furthermore, the Kunlun Realm might not remain unchanged. If the Golden Age comes, the Kunlun Realm may undergo changes and break this structure set by the Nine Emperors.” Mu Xueling softly sighed.

“That might not be necessarily good.” Lin Yun replied after a brief stun.

“That’s right.” Mu Xueling replied. “It might not necessarily be a good thing.”

When they returned, Lin Yun’s mood was a lot better. He looked at Mu Xueling and thoughtfully said, “Saint Elder, thank you.”

“Why are you thanking me?” Mu Xueling asked.

Lin Yun smiled, but he didn’t say anything about it. Mu Xueling normally seemed unapproachable, aloof, and as cold as an iceberg. Especially since her true appearance was so beautiful that it made others feel like she was a deity walking in the mortal world. She spoke so much today because she sensed his disappointment.

“Let’s go back. There’s no need to stay here any longer.” Lin Yun sighed, changing the topic. Yue Weiwei, Luo Shuyi, and the others had already returned to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, leaving him and Mu Xueling behind.

“Didn’t you promise the pavilion master that you’ll stay for a few more days?” Mu Xueling asked.

“I said ‘I guess,’ but didn’t say ‘yes’ or ‘no’.” Lin Yun said, recollecting himself.

“Perhaps you can wait a little longer.” Mu Xueling looked at Lin Yun with a profound gaze.

“Let’s wait, then.” Lin Yun replied.

Two hours later, the Young Pavilion Master of the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion, Jiang Yingtian, arrived. When he saw Lin Yun and Mu Xueling, he cupped his hands and said, “Lin Xiao, my father told me to bring you something.”

“What is it?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“A small gift.” Jiang Yingtian smiled, and he took out a jade bottle. “This is a drop of the Azure Divine Blood.”

“Azure Divine Blood?” Lin Yun looked at Mu Xueling confusedly. He didn’t know what treasure this was, and Mu Xueling beside him was also shocked, with surprise flashing within her pupils.

“There’s no need to hurry. My father said that Saint Elder should know the origin of this treasure and how to use it.” Jiang Yingtian smiled.

Lin Yun glanced at Mu Xueling. She should know about it since she didn’t deny it. He also wasn’t silly enough to ask her about it now, since this was definitely that she saw from some books.

But Jiang Yingtian didn’t stop there and said, “This is a body-refining technique, the Divine Azure Overlord Physique.”

Ripples began to start spreading within Lin Yun’s heart. For some reason, he felt that this treasure wasn’t simple.

“Wait, did your father say why he was giving these to me?” Lin Yun asked. He suddenly felt that something wasn’t right somewhere.

“Nothing.” Jiang Yingtian smiled. “I don’t know the specific reason. Brother Lin, don’t be in a hurry to ask about it. I still have another treasure for you.”

When he was done, he took out an ancient three-foot-long monument with ancient runes engraved on it. It seemed like there was something powerful sealed within it. Lin Yun could feel a chill running down his spine after just glancing at it.

“This is the Dragon Sealing Monument, and a complete Azure Dragon’s soul is sealed within it.” Jiang Yingtian said.

Hearing that, Lin Yun knew that these treasures weren’t simple, even if he was a fool.

“What do you mean by giving me these?” Lin Yun didn’t simply receive them. He knew he didn’t do anything to receive such treasures.

“These are a gift from my father. He told me to hand them over to you personally, so I would have needed to chase after you, even if you had left the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion.” Jiang Yingtian bitterly smiled. “Honestly speaking, these are all treasures, but I don’t know why he wants to give them to you. But please don’t refuse, or I’ll be in a difficult position.

“Oh, and there’s also another jade slip. My father told me you can’t use your sword techniques for some reason, and that this sword technique of the Azure Dragon’s lineage should be enough to replace them.” Jiang Yingtian said before retrieving a sword technique, which was a high-grade ghost spirit sword technique.

A high-grade ghost spirit sword technique was pretty high level, but it was nothing compared to the other three treasures. Lin Yun was surprised, and he would be lying if he said that he wasn’t tempted. But he couldn’t help feeling panicked about receiving them.

“You can go back now.” Mu Xueling said. This made Jiang Yingtian feel relieved before leaving. He was petrified that Lin Yun would refuse them and that he would receive a scolding when he returned.

“You don’t seem to want them?” Mu Xueling asked.

“Why would I dare to take them when I’ve done nothing to receive them?” Lin Yun replied indifferently. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“That’s not necessarily true. Didn’t the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master accept your Wind God Order? So why are you polite with him?” Mu Xueling said.

“That’s something Big Brother told me to give them.”

“Don’t dwell on it. They can do nothing to you, even if you don’t hand it to them with me around. These are all treasures of the Azure Dragon’s lineage, and each is a powerful treasure.” Mu Xueling waved her hand and summoned the jade bottle over. She said, “Let’s start with the Divine Azure Blood, first. This is a droplet of divine blood!”

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that.

“Divine blood is divided into different levels. After a divine beast becomes a deity, their divine blood will become a thousand times more precious than ordinary divine blood, and a drop of the Divine Azure Blood is comparable to tens of thousands of ordinary divine bloods.” Mu Xueling said, holding onto the jade bottle. “I’m afraid this Divine Azure Blood isn’t ordinary, and it might be a drop of divine blood from the Azure Dragon God King.”

Lin Yun’s face changed, and quickly thought of Li Wuyou, who went to the Firmament Sword Sect for a drop of Vermillion Bird’s divine blood. He asked, “According to your words, there is other divine blood in the world?”

“Of course.” Mu Xueling replied. “In the ancient battle between gods, many deities fell. Deities are divided into various levels, and even the corpse of an ordinary deity is a priceless treasure. Ancient holy lands and clans should have deity corpses, and the Sword Sect should also have them. In the current Kunlun Realm, only the Divine Dragon Empire has the most deity corpses.”

Lin Yun was shocked to hear that because it was a little terrifying that corpses could also be treasures. But thinking about it again, the saint origin of a Saint’s corpse was enough for thousands of people to fight over them, not to mention a deity’s corpse. The value wasn't just as simple as divine blood.

“So, do you still want to refuse now?” Mu Xueling threw the jade bottle over, and Lin Yun took it over by reflex. He wore a helpless expression because he didn’t want to refuse it now.

But when he tried to pull off the cap of the jade bottle, he realized that the lid wouldn’t budge, no matter how he tried.
