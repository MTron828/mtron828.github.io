Chapter 1543 - Three Hundred Years (1)

The Nether Divinity Clan was the leader of the Ancient Barren Domain’s ten saint clans. They received a title from the Divine Dragon Era and were situated northwest of the Ancient Barren Domain. There was no doubt that they were an overlord force.

It might be a clan, but they also recruit disciples. In terms of their strength, they weren’t inferior to the Ancient Barren Domain’s eight powerful forces. Even if they weren’t as strong as the eight powerful forces, no sect dared to do anything to the Nether Divinity Clan just because they were bestowed a title from the Divine Dragon Empire.

If any force wanted to do anything to the Nether Divinity Clan, they must consider the Divine Dragon Empire. After all, only ten clans within the Kunlun Realm have received a title from the Divine Dragon Empire.

The Nether Divinity Clan was massive, which was why they were comparable to powerful sects. In the Nether Divinity Hall, the patriarch of the Nether Divinity Clan, Qin Xiao, was discussing Jin Jue’s matter with the clan's elders.

Qin Xiao was the strongest expert on the surface of the Nether Divinity Clan and became a saint eight hundred years ago. Moreover, he had been controlling the Nether Divinity Clan for close to a millennium.

But he didn’t look old, judging from his middle-aged appearance. As for the other elders, they were all pinnacle Samsara Edict Realm experts. This was a powerful formation within the entire Eastern Desolation, and this was just an ordinary clan meeting.

Within the Ancient Barren Domain, all the powerful forces knew that the Qin Saint Clan, which received a title from the Divine Dragon Empire, definitely had more than one saint; they were deep and unfathomable. In addition to their connection between the Profound Sky Sect and Qin Saint Clan, the Nether Divinity Clan was the undisputed overlord of the northwest.

Aside from the Profound Valley, which was also a powerful force, no one within the northwest could contend with them.

“Grand Elder, have you arranged Jin Jue’s way out?” Qin Xiao asked, looking at the grey-clothed old man seated on his left. This old man was the Grand Elder of the Qin Clan and the second strongest expert on the surface of the clan.

“Patriarch, it has already been arranged.” Qin Xiao replied. “He should have reached the Nether Divinity Clan by now. Even if the Radiant Sword Saint makes a move, no one can threaten Jin Jue’s safety. I’ll get someone to fetch him once this matter settles down.”

“Well done!” Qin Xiao wore a satisfied smile on his face. “Jin Jue might not share the same surname as us, but there’s no doubt about his loyalty to the Qin Saint Clan. He even placed his life at risk when trying to assassinate Lin Yun. So we have to protect him, no matter what. Otherwise, no one will risk their lives for us anymore, and no one will be loyal to us.”

“It’s a pity about Jin Jue. He was only one step away from becoming a Law Enforcing Elder in the Profound Sky Sect.”

“It’s even more of a pity that he failed to kill that bastard!”

“The Sword Sect has been overstepping their boundaries in recent years. Even the other powerful sects must give our Qin Saint Clan some face. Does the Sword Sect still think that they’re a holy land?” Back on the Heavenly Path, none of the powerful sects dared to accept Lin Yun due to their intimidation, but only the Sword Sect was an exception. The Sword Sect took Lin Yun away by force, and the Nether Divinity Clan didn’t forget this grudge at all.

“Hmph!” A cold light flashed across Qin Xiao’s pupils. He had been unhappy with the Sword Sect for a long time. The Nether Divinity Realm Son was his great-great-grandson. Although Qin Xiao had a lot of great-great-grandsons, the fact that one could become the Nether Divinity Realm Son was enough to prove how outstanding that great-great-grandson of his was.

They got him to partake on the Heavenly Path to obtain fame and fortune, paving the way for him in the Kunlun Realm. The reason why the Nether Divinity Realm Son entered the Heavenly Path was to become the champion.

Since ancient times, those who could become the champion on the Heavenly Path all had the potential to become a saint after arriving in the Kunlun Realm. Qin Xiao spent so much effort to pave the way for his great-great-grandson, but it went down the drain because of Lin Yun. So this was undoubtedly a humiliation for Qin Xiao, and the fact that the Sword Sect took Lin Yun away was another slap to his face.

“That bastard, Tian Xuanzi, is too much! If he had personally made a move, that bastard would’ve already been dead!” Qin Xiao complained.

Facing Qin Xuan’s complaint, none of the elders dared to utter a word. But Qin Xiao didn’t stop complaining, “It looks like that bastard forgot who supported him in the Profound Sky Sect back then. Without the Nether Divinity Clan, would he be able to come this far?!”

The act of Tian Xuanzi expelling Jin Jue from the Profound Sky Sect naturally made Qin Xiao unhappy, not to mention Qin Cang’s matter. In his eyes, Qin Cang was no different from a traitor to the clan. Qin Cang was clearly a disciple of the Qin Saint Clan, but he didn’t place the clan’s interests in his eyes. On the Profound Wither Island, Qin Cang should’ve immediately killed Lin Yun.

“Elder, should we come up with a solution for this matter?”

“What solution?”

“The Sword Sect might come after us. After all, they’re once a holy land, and a skinny camel is still bigger than a horse.”

“Hahaha!” Qin Xiao laughed when he heard that. He disdainfully replied, “A skinny camel is bigger than a horse? Them? Who dares to come after us? The Radiant Sword Saint or Mu Xuankong? The Radiant Sword Saint is just a dying old man who doesn’t have much time left. As for Mu Xuankong, he was still playing with mud when I became a saint. He’s nothing in my eyes!

“The Sword Sect will be annihilated sooner or later. Mu Xuankong should rejoice that I didn’t go after him, but you’re concerned that he’ll come after me? He wouldn’t dare even if I lend him my guts!” Qin Xiao said in a confident and fearless tone.

The Nether Divinity Clan might still have a gap in their strength when compared to the Sword Sect, but they’re a saint clan that has received a title from the Divine Dragon Empire. Not to mention that they had allied with the Profound Sky Sect. Most importantly, they had the entire Divine Dragon Empire backing them up!

Qin Xiao might not have the guts to ask the Sword Sect to hand over Lin Yun, but he didn’t believe that the Sword Sect would dare to come after him. Anyone else might come, but the Sword Sect had long declined in his eyes. Once the Radiant Sword Saint passes away, the Sword Sect would be annihilated.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
