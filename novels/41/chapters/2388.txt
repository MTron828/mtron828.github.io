Chapter 2389 - Lin Jiangxian's Sword

After Luo Tianxi was done speaking, he simply introduced the rules before the banquet began. Aside from those who came from the nine testing grounds, there were also those invited and geniuses from Heaven’s Gate. But the disciples of Heaven’s Gate took a considerable portion.

But they were required to partake in a test before they could be at the banquet. They didn’t have to go to the Heavenly Barren Realm and had received special treatment. The main things in the Heavenly Barren Realm were the treasures and opportunities, as great opportunities followed significant risk.

Profound Sky Venerable led the deacons of the Heavenly Saint Courtyard, flew down from the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage, and approached the nearby bookstand with many jade slips on it. Each jade slip had a name, and those called out would have to go on the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage.

When a hundred people appeared on the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage, Profound Sky Venerable said, “You guys will fight amongst yourselves. Only ten people will move on to the next round.”

This was a brutal competition, but there was nothing they could do since there were too many people participating in the Heavenly Barren Banquet. So, they had to filter out the true geniuses quickly.

When Profound Sky Venerable was done speaking, a fight immediately occurred with constellations and dao flowers opening, attracting everyone’s gazes, including Lin Yun.

The outcome was soon determined. Those who could make it to the next round were all ninth-stage Saint Lords. It was no wonder that Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue decided to give up, since they couldn't fight these people. Ninth-stage Saint Lords were on a whole new level after going through three tribulations.

Lin Yun muttered, “There aren’t any ninth-stage Saint Lords from the ninth testing ground.”

According to Lin Jiangxian, those in the ninth testing ground were the youngest, meaning they also had a lower cultivation.

The next few rounds were also brutal, and everyone became heated when names from the nine testing grounds were called out. After all, those people fought their way out of the Heavenly Barren Realm.

“Those from the Heavenly Barren Realm are on a whole new level.”

“Not many geniuses from Heaven’s Gate can fight with those from the Heavenly Barren Realm, and they would only die if they ran into each other. I fathom that the protagonists are probably those from the Heavenly Barren Realm.” Many people noticed that those from the Heavenly Barren Realm could quickly suppress disciples from Heaven’s Gate.

Finally, Lin Jiangxian’s name was called out. No one paid much attention to her, since most people would neglect the ninth testing ground when mentioning the Heavenly Barren Realm. Of the hundred people who were called out with Lin Jiangxian, Di Feng was one of them. He was a primordial beast and from the same clan as Tuoba Hong. He might seem young, but he was stronger than Tuoba Hong.

“Who’s stronger? He or Tuoba Hong?” Ao Jue asked in concern.

“He’s stronger.” Xiong Tiannan was also nervous. The Heavenly Barren Banquet’s intensity was high, and many people were killed before they could even admit defeat.

But Lin Yun was calm as he wore a smile. He was confident in Lin Jiangxian.

On the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage, Di Feng’s presence soon attracted everyone’s attention, and he said, “You guys are unfortunate to be on the same stage as me. Aside from me, no one will make it to the next round.”

Everyone became furious after hearing what Di Feng said because that was too arrogant. They didn’t hesitate to charge at Di Feng together, “Let’s go! Kill him first!”

When everyone soared to the sky, they summoned their constellations, which shocked everyone because they had never seen so many people ganging up on one person before.

“Great!” Di Feng became excited as he let out a roar. As a silver radiance swept out, the attacks from everyone were stopped. But that wasn’t all. Di Feng began to flash around, throwing out a punch each time. This punch was simple, containing pure strength without any techniques.

Explosions resounded on the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage as multiple people were sent flying before they could even admit defeat, and it didn’t take long before the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage became clear.

“As expected.” No one could conceal the shock in their eyes, but they weren’t too surprised since they had already expected this outcome. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“You guys want to participate in the banquet with only this much strength? The ancestral deity doesn’t accept any garbage.” Di Feng was arrogant to mock the failures. But he soon noticed that there was still one person standing on the stage, and this person was Lin Jiangxian.

Di Feng was shocked because his attacks should have enveloped the entire stage, with no one being spared. But he soon thought of something, and sneered, “Interesting. I didn’t notice you earlier, but it’s a pity you ran into me. I won’t let anyone be promoted to the next round with me.”

“I don’t have that habit, but you can come if you want to see if my sword is fast enough,” Lin Jiangxian said indifferently.

Lin Yun smiled. Lin Jiangxian was as heroic as before. He sometimes felt that Lin Jiangxian’s Sword Dao was purer than his own. She endured for so many years, and now she could finally shine after grasping the Five Elements Dao.

Di Feng appeared before Lin Jiangxian in the next second and let out a roar, leaving behind ripples in the surrounding air. But when those ripples were about to come in contact with Lin Jiangxian, they were blocked by her sword intent.

“Finally, a decent opponent.” Di Feng’s eyes lit up with a smile as he threw his punch forth, leaving behind cracks in space and causing it to distort.

But Lin Jiangxian easily dodged his punch, carrying her sword. She indifferently said, “You’re too slow!”

Di Feng’s face became sinister as a constellation flew out, and a Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf leaped out from the painting, wanting to tear Lin Jiangxian into pieces with its claws. The claws tore cracks in space, but they were stopped by an invisible sword intent when the cracks wanted to spread to Lin Jiangxian. No matter how Di Feng used his constellation, he couldn’t touch Lin Jiangxian no matter what.

“This...” Everyone’s faces changed to shock. This made it look like Di Feng was weak, seeing how Lin Jiangxian easily dealt with his attacks.

“Is that the best you can do? It’s disappointing,” Lin Jiangxian said with a cold light flashing in her eyes when she raised her head.

“Not good!” Di Feng felt an extremely dangerous aura and quickly retreated. But it was already too late as Lin Jiangxian’s sword stabbed into his chest. When an explosion occurred, a sinister wound appeared on Di Feng’s chest as he rolled on the ground.

This was a shocking scene that nearly made everyone’s jaw fall.

“How is that possible?”

“Her sword is really fast... I can’t even keep up with it...”

“It’s not just fast, but it seemed to contain a certain profundity that overlapped space together before piercing with a sword.”

“Who is she? Which clan did she come from?” Everyone was shocked as they began to look into Lin Jiangxian’s background.

Luo Tianxi’s eyes lit up from his throne. Even Xia Qingyun and Ye Wuhen beside her were shocked as well.

“Sect Master, she’s Lin Jiangxian, a disciple of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion. Her master is Firmament Nether,” a Venerable said, recognizing Lin Jiangxian’s origin.

Luo Tianxi fell into deep thoughts, then asked, “She’s with Flower Burial from the ninth testing ground, right?”

“Yeah.”

Luo Tianxi smiled as he looked forward to Flower Burial’s strength.

Di Feng’s face was pale as he lay on the ground, and he was stopped by a gaze just when he wanted to release his Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf’s bloodline. The look came from Profound Sky Venerable.

Profound Sky Venerable was shocked by Lin Jiangxian’s strength, realizing that Lin Yun was shining too brightly to outshine her during the ninth testing ground.

“That’s enough. It’s not embarrassing for you to lose to someone from the ninth testing ground,” Profound Sky Venerable said coldly.

“That old man is pretty prideful,” Lin Yun smiled. Then again, the ninth testing ground should be the weakest, and they were brought here by Profound Sky Venerable. So, it was no wonder that Profound Sky Venerable looked so prideful.

“The ninth testing ground?”

“Someone from the ninth testing ground defeated Di Feng?” Profound Sky Venerable’s words caused an uproar, with everyone shocked.

Di Feng’s face became ashen, and he knew that Profound Sky Venerable was striking a blow to his arrogance. Hence, he could only leave with a dark face.

On the other hand, Lin Jiangxian was calm as she sheathed her sword.

“Lass, you’ve hidden yourself pretty deeply,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled when Lin Jiangxian walked past him.

Lin Jiangxian merely nodded and left without saying a word.

On the other hand, an uproar broke out in the surrounding area. The Heavenly Barren Banquet had finally become interesting, with everyone feeling their blood boiling with fighting spirits.
