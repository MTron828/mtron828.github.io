Chapter 1619 - Cutting The Tribulation

Ye Ziling and Mu Xueqin’s faces gradually became solemn. Demonic corpses were extremely dangerous in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, more hazardous than ordinary demonic beasts. So no one practically dared to provoke them.

After all, when they slay demonic beasts, it’s because their beast cores were precious, and some of their values might surpass saint elixirs. On the other hand, demonic corpses were pure trouble because they might lose their lives if they weren’t careful, not to mention that there wouldn’t be any harvest in slaying the demonic corpses. So no one would face demonic corpses if they had a choice.

“These demonic corpses don’t seem ordinary. The vertical eye on their forehead is silver…” Ye Ziling spoke out.

Nodding her head, Mu Xueqin replied, “They’re Silver-Eyed Demonspirits, and they can be considered nobles among the Demonspirit Clan in terms of their bloodlines. They’re also far stronger than ordinary demonspirits. We can’t stay here for long, or we might alarm them. We have to leave immediately!”

She was cautious and didn’t want the Sword Sect’s disciples to be in danger.

“Wait.” Ye Ziling’s eyes were on the towering tree behind the old man, and she said, “This might not be a saint tree.”

“What can it possibly be, then?”

“Constellation. Or rather, a Saint Constellation!” Ye Ziling said after a brief pondering. After reaching the Saint Realm, one’s constellation would transform into a Saint Constellation. Saint Constellations were terrifying with unimaginable power. Anyone beneath the Saint Realm was considered an ant before a Saint Constellation; they wouldn’t even be able to look at a Saint Constellation straight.

“If it’s a Saint Constellation, how can we get so close to it?” Mu Xueqin didn’t believe it. “Not to mention, can a Saint Constellation exist for thousands of years?”

“I don’t sense any vitality in that tree.” Ye Ziling replied, and her words alarmed Mu Xueqin. Now that Mu Xueqin looked at it again, she also couldn’t sense any vitality in the tree. A saint tree could be considered a life and should possess boundless vitality comparable to saints. But they couldn’t feel any vitality coming from this saint tree.

“Weird…” Mu Xueqin muttered.

“Let’s check it. If the demonspirits come to life, I’ll use my White Dragon Saint Sword to lure them away. But if that really is a Saint Constellation, this place might contain the inheritance of an Ancient Great Saint.” Ye Ziling emphasized.

Even Mu Xueqin was tempted when she heard that. After all, a Saint Constellation’s value was much more significant than any saint elixir or incomplete dragon spirit martial technique.

“But…” Mu Xueqin still hesitated.

“I don’t deny the risk, but it’s worth it for us to do it, either way. I can protect myself with the White Dragon Saint Sword.” Ye Ziling had long weighed the pros and cons. Even if it was dangerous for her to lure the ten demonspirits away, it was still worth it for them to try it.

Seeing this, Mu Xueqin knew that Ye Ziling had already made up her mind, and she realized that the latter was more decisive than her. Mu Xueqin could see Lin Yun’s silhouette on Ye Ziling.

“We’ll go with that, then. Be careful.” Mu Xueqin ultimately nodded before she carefully approached that towering tree with Ye Ziling.

Lin Yun was still making preparations for his breakthrough. The boundless energy from nine saint elixirs rampaged within his meridians with lightning bolts descending from the thunderclouds in the sky. But it wasn’t the end after the lightning fell because the flames from the lightning were incinerating Lin Yun’s body, causing a series of explosions within him.

The pain was unbearable and even more horrible than his previous tribulation. What the Black Turtle Ancestor said wasn’t wrong, but there was nothing he could do about it. Even if he could fight those at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm when he was only at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, he would still have to pay a price.

There was no shortcut in this world. Iris Sword Saint and Southern Emperor’s inheritance allowed him to forge an unimaginable foundation. But everything came with a price in the world since everything was fair. Since his foundation made him more potent than others, his tribulation would be even more terrifying.

If he made it through this tribulation, the rest of his journey would be smooth, and he would be invincible amongst the same generation. He would lose his life here if he couldn’t make it through. Since ancient times, this was the heaven-defying path that countless geniuses took, and many died along the way.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

As a faint light enveloped Lin Yun’s body, blood seeped out from his pores, and he was in a hazardous condition. The massive power accumulated within his body went out of control and started devouring him. But fortunately, Lin Yun maintained his composure right from the start.

He already predicted that the various energies within his body would go into chaos, but he maintained his composure to control the sword ocean in his brows. As long as he stayed calm and his sword intent was under his control, he would still have a chance, no matter what.

His right hand suddenly exploded with his blood flowing down, and it didn’t take long for the dragon origin in his blood to start burning.

“Looks like I won’t be able to last for long…” Lin Yun muttered to himself as fine cracks appeared on his arm.

Raising his head to look at the thunderclouds with crimson lightning flickering about, he saw that each of the crimson bolts was covered with saint runes. As the crimson lightning intertwined, they manifested into a ferocious beast covered with runes.

A brief moment later, a pair of crimson pupils appeared within the thunderclouds. When that pair of eyes appeared, the surroundings became terrifyingly quiet, with the ground still trembling. Lin Yun could feel his heart beating.

This scene was weird, and Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to release a seal on the Profound Wither Key. As his heart started pumping, the power left behind by the Profound Wither Great Saint poured out of his chest.

As white energy covered his body, all his injuries were recovered in a split second, and his aura began rising with waves of white energy that shot out and suppressed the surrounding flames. The golden human in his brow also began accumulating power, causing the entire sword ocean to tremble.

“It’s coming!” Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes.

When that pair of crimson eyes descended, the crimson lightning manifested into a demonic python that emitted a terrifying aura and fell towards Lin Yun. When the crimson python fell, the surrounding air was crushed, and the ground collapsed with cracks spreading out.

Lin Yun could feel his dragon origin being suppressed and he couldn’t move as his blood was being frozen. The demonic python’s power was too terrifying. It was so mighty that it could suppress everything else. As the white energy from the Profound Wither Key began to accumulate, it swiftly formed into an old man.

“Sword!” That old man roared and extracted the golden human and golden azure dragon from Lin Yun’s sword ocean. The two sword souls swiftly merged into a gigantic golden sword before that old man swung his sword down.

His sword severed the demonic python into two. When the third dragon pulse swiftly formed within his body, it swiftly expanded the dragon origin in his violet palace by two-fold.

The power from the Profound Wither Key swiftly allowed Lin Yun to reach the pinnacle third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. When Lin Yun activated his three dragon pulses, he could sense his strength rapidly rising.

But his eyes shone as he looked at the old man who was slowly disappearing. This was the remnant will of the Profound Wither Great Saint. The Profound Wither Great Saint was still helping him even after his death.

“I’ll help you if you ask me. It’s a tribulation, and one sword is required to cut it apart.” The Profound Wither Great Saint smiled before he released his grip on the golden sword. The golden sword divided, returning to a golden azure dragon with a golden human before returning to Lin Yun’s sword ocean.

As Lin Yun’s body trembled, he finally returned to his top state with his sword intent and cultivation perfectly merged together.

“Thank you, Senior Profound Wither!” Lin Yun cupped his hands together.

When the Profound Wither Great Saint disappeared, Lin Yun felt that he had never existed and yet never left in the first place; this was a complicated feeling. Letting out a breath, Lin Yun found his tribulation a little weird because there was a demonic python at the end. It was clearly formed with lightning, but it gave him the feeling that the python was alive.

If it wasn’t for the Profound Wither Great Saint at the end, he might not have been able to deal with that python alone.

“Only five seals left on the Profound Wither Key!” Lin Yun muttered. “Looks like I have to bear the other tribulations myself. I have to cherish the remaining five times…”

He had finally reached the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, which meant he could start practicing the Divine Tortoise Transformation. This also meant that he should be able to reach complete mastery of the first form of the Sovereign Dragon Fist—Soaring Divine Dragon.

He had to stabilize his cultivation before practicing the Sovereign Dragon Fist’s first form. Last but not least, he had to meet up with the other Sword Sect’s disciples.

“If I had run into Xuan Feng, Chen Tao, and Xiao Kui again, it should be easy for me to win even if the three joined hands.” Lin Yun’s eyes flushed with confidence. Previously, when he fought those three, he still had to resort to the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron. But he was confident that he didn’t need it now.

After spending half a day to stabilize his cultivation, Lin Yun then practiced the Sovereign Dragon Fist. He first formed the Sovereign Dragon Seal, then the Blue Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal, and Silver Dragon Seal, unleashing three dazzling lights.

At the same time, he also circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art, Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon at the same time.

When all the energies gathered in his fingers, a boundless vitality would appear whenever he formed a seal, and a massive dragon aura would empower him.

Lin Yun’s hands made a total of eighteen changes. Even after his dragon aura multiplied by eighteen times, his vitality wasn’t fully exhausted.

This brought joy to Lin Yun’s face and made him excited. His vitality had indeed transformed after reaching the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. In the past, he would reach his limit after ten-fold. But now, it still wasn’t the end after eighteen-fold.

“Sovereign Dragon Seal!” After his dragon aura reached a limit, Lin Yun’s hands joined together, and a profound seal appeared in his hand. In the next second, Lin Yun’s pupils became golden, and an oppressive dragon aura swept out from him.

Enveloped in a dazzling light, Lin Yun’s face became grave. Letting out a roar, the seal in his palm was fully released, manifesting into a dazzling sun that shone within a hundred-mile radius.

“This is too powerful!” Lin Yun was stumped, looking at the might. He now knew why this martial technique had a ‘Sovereign’ at the front. He was now looking forward to witnessing the power of the Soaring Divine Dragon and seeing if he could unleash the thousand soaring dragons that was recorded on the stone monument.
