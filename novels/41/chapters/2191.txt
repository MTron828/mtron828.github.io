Chapter 2192: Who's The Bait?

The commotion caused in the Dao Yang Palace was huge. The entire Dao Yang Palace was enveloped in a white pillar of light along with multiple constellations, intertwining as they were submerged by moonlight.

Dao Yang Palace has two palaces, three courtyards, and seventy-two peaks, covering a vast area which was almost the same scale as the Heavenly Domain City. But every corner of the Heavenly Dao Sect could see the phenomena if they raised their heads. Even if they couldn’t see, they could also sense the saint aura that spreaded over.

Lin Yun was shocked because the other places were calm aside from the Dao Yang Palace, including the seventy-two peaks.

“The Thousand Plume Great Saint has instructed to restrain all the disciples and everyone beneath the Saint Realm didn’t have to get involved,” Ye Guhan explained when he noticed Lin Yun’s doubts.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and he could tell that the Thousand Plume Great Saint had made preparations. He asked, “What if…”

“If anything happens, I will bring you away. The disciples beneath the Saint Realm won’t pose any threat, and no one will target them. Furthermore, the Bai and Zhang Clan won’t be able to carry on watching at that time. Because at that time, even if the Heavenly Dao Sect wasn’t far from being destroyed, even if it wasn’t destroyed,” Ye Guhan interrupted.

“So, we can only watch?” Lin Yun asked.

“I know that you have the means to ensure your safety, but wait. There’s not much meaning to join a battle of this scale unless you’re planning to put your life on the line. Believe me,” Ye Guhan said with a grave expression.

Lin Yun nodded and sat back down. He could only pray that the Heavenly Dao Sect makes it through this ordeal.

“He’s right. There is not much meaning for you to join the battle between Great Saints unless you’re at Tian Xuanzi’s level,” Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded from the Iris Secret Realm. She continued, “Even if your two mistresses can’t fight them, it’s not an issue for them to ensure their safety. But to cause such a huge commotion, it looks like my speculation was wrong…”

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun asked.

“The Solar Lunar Divine Rune might not be in the Nether Orchid Courtyard but in the Dao Yang Palace. But it makes no sense…I clearly sensed it back then, but the chaos is at the Dao Yang Palace.” Lil’ Purple frowned.

Lin Yun opened his eyes, and he had a bad premonition. If the Solar Lunar Divine Rune was really in the Nether Orchid Courtyard, something would happen there soon or later. Could it be that the Dao Yang Palace was a cover? He couldn’t sit still anymore and told ye Guhan about it.

But Ye Guhan shook his head, and he replied, “Except for the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, no one knows where the Solar Lunar Divine Rune is at, including those from the Blood Moon Sect. Even if it’s in the Nether Orchid Courtyard, the Wang Clan doesn’t have any more forces to breach the Nether Orchid Courtyard. Don’t forget that the Bai Clan isn’t a pushover.”

Lin Yun pondered briefly, and he asked, “But what if the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign makes a move? Senior Brother, have you thought of the possibility that the Ye Clan have joined forces with the Blood Moon Sect? Not only the Wang Clan, but the Ye Clan as well.”

Ye Guhan was stumped upon hearing that because this topic was a little sensitive. This was because Ye Guhan was from the Ye Clan, and he knew how powerful the Ye Clan was in the Heavenly Dao Sect. If the Ye Clan joined forces with the Blood Moon Sect, the situation would become terrible. As a fellow member of the Ye Clan, Ye Guhan didn’t know if he would swing his sword at his fellow clansmen.

Suddenly, a loud booming disrupted Ye Guhan’s thoughts as a terrifying fluctuation came from the Dao Yang Palace, causing the Profound Maiden Courtyard to tremble.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw multiple figures enveloped in saint radiance as they charged at the Dao Yang Palace like meteorites. This was because the array had been broken.

The Gale Rein Great Saint stood with the hooded man together in the air as they looked down at the Dao Yang Palace. The Saints of their factions have landed on the Dao Yang Palace, swiftly clearing the obstacles. The hooded man said, “The array protecting the Dao Yang Palace is weaker than I’ve imagined.”

“That’s because that old man doesn’t want the Ye Clan interfering with the Dao Yang Palace. If the Ye Clan joined the Dao Yang Palace, the array wouldn’t be that easy to break,” the Gale Rein Great Saint sneered. But breaking the array was only the first step as their gazes fell onto the Dao Yang Palace. They both disappeared and appeared before the main hall.

As an explosion took place, four figures appeared behind the two of them, donning crimson moon robes and black robes, releasing a powerful aura in the Saint Sovereign. Everyone else was fighting with the Dao Yang Palace’s Saints, and the fight above the Dao Yang Palace was intense.

But the Gale Rein Great Saint didn’t care about that as they pushed the door apart, entering without any hesitation. But the main hall was calm, and they were expecting the three Great Saints waiting for them with the elites. But they were nowhere to be seen with a jade bed at the center.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint laid on the bed with a pale face, and he didn’t have any vitality. This was a corpse!

“Something isn’t right!” The Gale Rein Great Saint frowned as the interior was different from what he had imagined. This should be the battlefield for the final battle, but the three Great Saints were nowhere to be seen when they should be here.

Even if the Thousand Plume Great Saint was dead, it makes no sense to leave his corpse here. If they were planning to leave the Heavenly Dao Sect, they should’ve brought the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s corpse with them. Most importantly, it wasn’t that easy to kill a Great Saint, and the Gale Rein Great Saint knew how terrifying a Great Saint’s life force was.

Great Saints were the limit of the Saint Realm, and Great Saints were at the pinnacle of Kunlun Realm if the Emperors didn’t show themselves. Even if Tian Xuanzi’s attack was ruthless, the Thousand Plume Great Saint shouldn’t have died so fast.

A Saint Sovereign donning a red robe waved his hand as a saint sword hovered in the sky, and he poured his saint aura along with saint dao into it. As the saint sword trembled, ripples spread out in the surrounding along with fine cracks. He wanted to make a move and destroy the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s corpse.

“Don’t move,” the hooded man spoke out. “This might not be his corpse, and we would all be affected if this is a trap.”

This made everyone else uncertain because there was that possibility, and the saint sword returned to the hands of that Saint Sovereign.

The Gale Rein Great Saint looked around, and he said, “I can guarantee that this is the Thousand Plume Great Saint. As for whether there were any traps, let’s go and take a look.”

He was calm, and he was also stronger than imagined. This had disrupted his plans, but he wasn’t too concerned. He took a step forth and appeared before the jade bed, forming seals with both hands and circulating his cultivation technique with Greater Dao’s flowers blooming behind him.

He was cautious because he knew that the Thousand Plume Great Saint wouldn’t die so easily. When everything was done, he reached out to grab on the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s wrist, and his face changed.

“How is it?” The hooded man asked as he stepped forth with everyone else.

“He’s really dead,” the Gale Rein Great Saint muttered. He had fought with the Thousand Plume Great Saint for centuries, and he suddenly felt empty seeing that his opponent was dead. The fatal attack was on his forehead, and the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s Saint Soul was shattered. If his soul was dead, he was dead even if his body was alive.

“Tian Xuanzi is really ruthless,” the Gale Rein Great Saint muttered, looking at the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s forehead. They both received the challenge from Tian Xuanzi, and he rejected it without any hesitation.

But the Thousand Plume Great Saint accepted the challenge because he wanted to make a bet to obtain a breakthrough through the fight.

“How is it that easy to reach the Emperor Realm…” The Gale Rein Great Saint said self-mockingly.

“I want this corpse, but it’s of utmost importance to verify the location of the three Great Saints. If they’re really gone, we wouldn’t have any concerns left,” the hooded man said with flames blazing in his eyes.

But the Gale Rein Great Saint didn’t agree on the spot, and he said, “Let’s talk about it again.”

He looked at the surroundings and could feel that something wasn’t right somewhere.

Suddenly, the already ‘dead’ Ye Qianyu opened his eyes with his fingers reaching the Gale Rein Great Saint’s heart. This attack came too quickly, and the Gale Rein Great Saint couldn’t respond in time. There was a golden sphere at the tip of the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s fingertips, containing unimaginable power.

“The Vital Origin Finger!” The Gale Rein Great Saint had fear reflected in his eyes, and he took this attack head-on even if he had his guards up.

The few people beside th4e Gale Rein Great Saint quickly retreated, but they were also caught in the shockwave as they slammed against the stone pillars, throwing out blood. The Gale Rein Great Saint was heavily injured, and there was a severe wound on his chest even if he made preparations. His ribs were revealed with his wounds looking terrifying.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint suddenly hovered in the air and released a dazzling radiance. He was dead a moment ago, but he came to life right now. Furthermore, the aura he gave off wasn’t any weaker compared to his strongest state.

The gates of the main hall closed as the three Great Saints appeared from three different directions with countless Saints behind them. With a rough glance, there were at least twenty Saints, and this formation would leave anyone dumbfounded.

Seeing this, the Gale Rein Great Saint smiled, “What a huge formation with so many people willing to follow you to the death. I’m really surprised.”

“A guardian of the Blood Moon Sect like you won’t understand the feelings everyone had for the Heavenly Dao Sect. Today is the day of your death, and I have been putting up with you for a long time,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said coldly.

The Gale Rein Great Saint was heavily injured, not to mention there were so many Saints surrounding them along with three Great Saints.

But the Gale Rein Great Saint looked relaxed as he smiled, “You used yourself as the bait, but have you thought that I’m also a bait? This should be all your strength, right?”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint thought of something, and her face changed as she looked at the Gale Rein Great Saint.

The Gale Rein Great Saint smiled, “Too late.”

“It won’t take us long to kill you,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said coldly.

The Gale Rein Great Saint was still bleeding from his lips, but he didn’t panic as he smiled, “Kill me? Don’t even dream about it. You can’t kill me, and none of you will be able to escape. Stay behind!”

The moment he said that, the hooded man opened up the vertical golden line on his forehead. This was a golden eye that revealed before everyone, leaving everyone shocked as the hooded man was a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit.

But that wasn’t all as the two people behind him also removed their hood, opening their vertical eyes and they were Silver-Eyed Demonspirits.

At this moment, everyone discovered that the hooded man was a Great Saint of the Demonspirit Clan, possessing a rare bloodline and was a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit.The commotion caused in the Dao Yang Palace was huge. The entire Dao Yang Palace was enveloped in a pillar of white light along with multiple constellations, intertwining as they became submerged by moonlight.

Dao Yang Palace had two palaces, three courtyards, and seventy-two peaks, covering a vast area that was almost on the same scale as Heavenly Domain City.

“If anything happens, I will bring you away. The disciples beneath the Saint Realm won’t pose any threat, and no one will target them. Furthermore, the Bai and Zhang Clans won’t be able to continue watching as a bystander at that time. Because at that time, even if the Heavenly Dao Sect isn’t destroyed, it would be significantly weakened,” Ye Guhan interrupted.

.

“So, we can only watch?” Lin Yun asked.

“I know that you have the means to ensure your safety, but wait. There’s not much meaning in joining a battle of this scale unless you’re planning to put your life on the line. Believe me,” Ye Guhan said with a grave expression.

But Ye Guhan shook his head, and replied, “Except for the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, no one knows where the Solar Lunar Divine Rune is located, including those from the Blood Moon Sect. Even if it’s in the Nether Orchid Courtyard, the Wang Clan doesn’t have any more forces to breach the Nether Orchid Courtyard. Don’t forget that the Bai Clan isn’t a pushover.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered, then asked, “But what if the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign makes a move? Senior Brother, have you thought of the possibility that the Ye Clan could have joined forces with the Blood Moon Sect? Not only the Wang Clan, but the Ye Clan as well.”

Ye Guhan was stumped upon hearing that because this topic was a little sensitive. This was because Ye Guhan was from the Ye Clan, and he knew how powerful the Ye Clan was within the Heavenly Dao Sect. If the Ye Clan joined forces with the Blood Moon Sect, the situation would become terrible.

He was cautious because he knew that the Thousand Plume Great Saint wouldn’t die so easily. When everything was done, he reached out to grab a hold of the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s wrist, and his face changed.

“How is it?” The hooded man asked as he stepped forth with everyone else.

“He’s really dead,” the Gale Rein Great Saint muttered. He had fought with the Thousand Plume Great Saint for centuries, but he suddenly felt empty upon seeing that his opponent was dead.
