Chapter 2369 - Blood Conceal King!

Lin Jiangxian sensed Lin Yun’s actions, and asked, “What’s going on?”

Lin Yun recollected his gaze, and said, “I felt someone spying on me, but it didn’t seem to contain any ill intentions. It felt as though it came from far away...”

After the sword intent reached Firmament Sword Intent, one could sense danger. After reaching the Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent, the senses would become even keener.

Lin Yun not only sensed that gaze, but he could even determine the distance and if there was any hostility.

“It must be from the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain. It’s most likely Profound Sky Venerable,” Lin Jiangxian said. “This involves life and death, but everyone here has a huge background.”

Lin Yun nodded and shared the same speculation as well. He decided, “Let’s continue forth. There’s already no path of retreat for us.”

If they wanted to gather more spirit cores, they would have to continue moving deeper into the mountain range.

Three days later, the three came to the summit of a mountain, and they couldn’t help squinting from the golden radiance. When they adapted to the light, they noticed that a barren land was before them, and it looked like an ancient battlefield with countless corpses and a grave the size of a mountain at the center of it.

The grave exploded with a dazzling golden radiance as a powerful aura swept out, and a vertical eye could be faintly seen. As the wind blew past, a howling sound was produced as multiple figures rushed over.

They didn’t bother concealing themselves and looked excited. They had already guessed what was in the grave, and everyone here was a genius. Over the past three days, they had already collected a hundred spirit cores.

It wasn’t an exception for Lin Yun’s group either. They had collected two hundred and seventy spirit cores, and there were many silver spirit cores.

Lin Yun looked at the grave and exclaimed, “A golden spirit core!”

Just the aura from the grave alone was different from the others, not to mention the golden vertical eye from the crack on the grave.

“There might be a saint soul within the golden spirit core, and he must have sent the Silver-Eyed Demonspirits.” Lin Yun soon connected everything, realizing that it wasn’t a coincidence.

Ji Zixi’s eyes flashed while looking at the grave. She said, “According to Profound Sky Venerable, obtaining the Golden Spirit Core will receive a ticket straight to the Heavenly Barren Banquet.”

There were more than ten who obtained a hundred spirit cores, so they would have to fight for the quotas. But if they obtained the golden spirit core, they wouldn’t have to join the competition. Everyone looked excited because the quotas alone were tempting enough.

Lin Yun knew the value of the golden spirit core, but he didn’t have much emotional fluctuation. He fought with the Ying River King before, so he didn’t dare to look down on Golden-Eyed Demonspirits. Golden-Eyed Demonspirits were royalties amongst the Demonspirit Clan, and they were equivalent to human cultivators who possessed natal saint physiques or even divine physiques.

Golden-Eyed Demonspirits were already so terrifying in the Kunlun Realm, but the demonspirits here were tougher. So, he had to be careful against this golden spirit core. After he carefully looked at it, he sensed a dense, deathly aura around him. The corpses on the ground were filled with boundless murderous intent, so there must be an array here.

“Let’s head on over for now.” Lin Yun soared to the sky and headed for the ancient battleground. A thousand miles wasn’t far for Saints, but everyone stayed outside, fearful of the bizarre array.

“Lin Yun is here.” Shangguan Jue and Zhao Zhanli were surprised. Even Heavenly Book was surprised when he saw Lin Yun’s arrival.

“Sword intent is ineffective here, so he can reach here?” Not only him but everyone else had noticed Lin Yun’s group.

“Chief, Lin Yun is also here with Lin Jiangxian!”

“How is that possible?” The Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s faction was shocked when they saw that Lin Jiangxian and Ji Zixi were still around.

Jiang Ziyao furiously muttered, “Why is he still around? He’s really bold!”

“The array is gradually weakening, and it seems to be related to the grave,” Lin Yun said after looking at the grave on a tree. The golden spirit core seemed to be the core of this array, providing energy to the entire array. But today, it seemed significantly exhausted after mobilising the Silver-Eyed Demonspirits to deal with them. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“The grave will probably explode...” Lin Jiangxian said nervously.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with determination to obtain the golden spirit core.

The grave on the ancient battlefield began to tremble as the golden radiance that was being released grew even stronger. As more cracks appeared on the grave, the golden spirit core soared with the surrounding spiritual energy pouring into it. As a deathly aura poured into the spirit core, the energy contained within it began to rise. That was a dark energy comparable to a primordial aura.

The surrounding geniuses’ attention was on the golden spirit core, and they had guessed something. But they were fearless, and the alliance they formed even became fragile because everyone wanted the golden spirit core. Even if they couldn’t attend the Heavenly Barren Banquet, it would benefit them significantly.

Right then, a few more cracks appeared on the grave. Finally, someone couldn’t hold back and charged onto the ancient battlefield. More people followed after them and the saint radiance they released lit up the surroundings.

“Wait.” Lin Yun reached out to stop Lin Jiangxian and Ji Zixi.

“How dare you guys disrupt my slumber!” Just when those figures were about to get close to the golden spirit core, the sounds of shackles breaking apart could be heard as a giant figure rose from the ground. This figure was three hundred feet in height, even when only the upper half of its body came out from the ground.

It looked like an ancient human, wearing a crown with crimson eyes. He held onto the shackles and waved them around, causing the surrounding space to distort, catching everyone by surprise and sending them flying back.

Some cultivators died on the spot. This was a spectacular scene as saint blood and corpses rained down from the sky. That figure devoured those corpses and slowly became refined as his lower body came out as well. When that figure landed, he manifested a physique with golden armor while looking around.

When Lin Yun looked around, he could see Heavenly Book and Jiang Ziyao standing where they were. Even someone like Qin Yun and Tuoba Hong didn’t move, either.

“I am the Blood Conceal King of the Spirit Clan. Leave now, or I will ensure all of your deaths here!” That golden figure coldly looked over with his voice echoing, releasing a Saint Sovereign’s aura that made everyone squint.

If this demonspirit was a Saint Sovereign, they would be powerless against him.

“It’s not a genuine Saint Sovereign, but one with a Saint Sovereign’s saint soul, relying on saint blood and flesh to reforge its physique... but it’s not easy to deal with it.” Heavenly Book frowned with his face becoming ugly. Everyone else could sense a danger coming from this Blood Conceal King. Even if he had just reforged his physique, he was still a Saint Sovereign and the aura he gave off was terrifying.

“The golden spirit core is my treasure, and no one can go after it!” The Blood Conceal King’s voice echoed. Crimson flames blazed within its eyes as he looked around. Just his gaze alone was enough to plunge everyone into hell.

“This is troublesome...” Lin Yun sighed.

“What’s the matter?” Ji Zixi and Lin Jiangxian asked.

“The golden spirit core was probably nourished for a thousand years, and if the Blood Conceal King devours it, he can come back to life. Heaven’s Gate wants to test us and use our hands to get rid of this Blood Conceal King,” Lin Yun said.

He had speculated that Profound Sky Venerable wasn’t the only one looking at them but the experts of the Demonspirit Clan as well. This was a bet between both sides, and only juniors were allowed to make a move. If they couldn’t stop the Blood Conceal King, he would come back to life again.

If he had guessed correctly, the Blood Conceal King probably had a considerable background and wasn’t just a Saint Sovereign. So, if they wanted the golden spirit core, they would have to completely kill the Blood Conceal King.

The Blood Conceal King was strong, and his Saint Sovereign’s aura was enough to put tremendous pressure on them. This was his most significant advantage against everyone. If they didn’t have a firm heart, they couldn’t even exhibit half of their strength.

They might stand a chance if they joined forces since they were all geniuses. Upon realizing that, everyone’s eyes flashed as they began to look at each other.

“Why don’t we put down our feud and join hands for now?” Qin Yun broke the silence.
