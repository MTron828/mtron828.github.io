Chapter 2122: Erotic DreamChapter 2122 - Erotic Dream

Tian Xing saw through Lin Yun’s thoughts but didn’t hold it against the latter. He couldn’t participate in this prosperous age, so he would get Lin Yun to experience it on his behalf. He smiled, “Do you know what is the profundity of Firmament Sword Intent?”

“My sword manifesting into the sky,” Lin Yun nodded.

“What about the Astral Sword Intent, then?” Tian Xing asked.

“Drawing the galaxies from beyond the thirty-sixth layer of heaven through the dream.” Lin Yun said. That was what Ye Guhan told him, and he always kept it in mind.

“Do you know what ‘beyond the thirty-sixth layer of heaven’ means? That is to manifest a sword star with starlight, and you even manifest two sword stars. But what does ‘through the dream’ mean?” Tian Xing asked.

Lin Yun frowned because he never thought of it before. He muttered, “Does it mean I must go into the dream?”

“Where’s the dream at?” Tian Xing asked.

“This…” Lin Yun was puzzled.

“It depends on the individual. You will want to take a trip to the dream since your Astral Sword Intent will reach the pinnacle of complete mastery when the time comes. But if you want to achieve it shortly, you can only use this method. But this method is dangerous, and you might be trapped in it,” Tian Xing said.

Lin Yun briefly fell into deep thoughts, then he said, “Senior, please guide me. I have already made my decision.”

.

“Okay!” Tian Xing said, “I won’t beat around the bush with you, and the dream is in your heart.”

He pointed at Lin Yun’s heart and said, “But it isn’t the heart I’m talking about. I can bring you into the dream, but you can only rely on yourself to see if you can come out.”

Lin Yun nodded. There wasn’t a safe shortcut, since risks and opportunities coexisted. He couldn’t reach the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm before the Blue Dragon Record arrived, so he was willing to take a bet.

“Little Crane, bring me the Seven Dipper Lamp,” Tian Xing instructed.

“Okay.” The Crane Fairy nodded and entered the pavilion before coming out with an ancient bronze lamp.

Tian Xing said, “Your task is to gather all of the astral fire in the dream and light a lamp before you can come out. If you succeed, you will plant the seed of your dream. This way, even a Saint won’t be able to tear apart your sword intent since the seed is in your dream and cannot be extinguished even if the wind is great.”

Lin Yun came to his senses and asked, “What will I experience in the dream?”

Tian Xing said, “There are seven dreams corresponding to the human's seven emotions and six desires. There are sweet dreams, and there are also nightmares. But sometimes, nightmares are better than a sweet dream.”

The Crane Fairy smiled, “Master, there’s also an erotic dream, and he might not be willing to come out. They’re all calling him the Holy Maiden Killer now. The moment he enters the dream, he can have as many holy maidens as he wants.”

Lin Yun was speechless when he heard that. It must be those saint disciples who attempted the Celestial Purging Mountain that spoke about it and were heard by the Celestial Crane.

“Holy Maiden Killer?” Tian Xing smiled. “Not bad!”

“Senior, they’re all baseless accusations!” Lin Yun wanted to explain.

“No need to explain. Who isn’t playful when they’re young? Who hasn’t dreamt of a holy maiden before? The night will be long,” Tian Xing smiled.

Lin Yun wanted to argue, but Tian Xing said, “Let’s not talk about it any further and light the lamp.”

“Okay!” The Celestial Crane lit up the Seven Dipper Lamp and blue smoke soon spread. The Seven Dipper Lamp became bright while drawing in the starlight from beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven.

“Close your eyes,” Tian Xing said, and Lin Yun followed the instructions. As the blue smoke spread, Lin Yun’s consciousness gradually blurred, before he soon fell asleep. The dream felt very realistic and vague. Lin Yun didn’t know why he was there or where he would go. He only knew about enjoying the happiness in his dream.

This was the difference between the dream and illusion. The dream would make one sink into it with their emotions and senses affected. Without knowing it, he didn’t know how long he spent in the dream as he drank wine with the various holy maidens.

On this day, when Lin Yun played the zither with all the holy maidens dancing, their figures were graceful.

“Young Master, the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden will be responsible for serving you tonight,” An Liuyan said as she looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun raised his head, and all the holy maidens disappeared, leaving only the aloof Bai Shuying behind. At this moment, Bai Shuying was looking at him like a little girl waiting to be picked by him. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Young Master…” An Liuyan’s charming voice resounded, making Lin Yun’s throat dry.

Lin Yun grabbed An Liuyan into his embrace and smiled, “You too, as well!”

“Young Maser, you’re really bad.” Despite what she said, An Liuyan went along with Lin Yun.

As her clothes brushed through the zither, Lin Yun asked, “What did I play earlier?”

“The night is precious. So why is Young Master caring about a song?” An Liuyan smiled.

“What song did I play earlier? Why can’t I recall it?” Lin Yun fell into confusion as he pushed An Liuyan away.

“Young Master, I’d like to sit on you.” An Liuyan pressed her body against Lin Yun, and he was immediately captivated by her.

“What song did I play earlier?” Lin Yun frowned. But he still smiled, “Liuyan, wait for me for a moment.”

Lin Yun pushed An Liyuan away and came over to the zither. But no matter how he tried, he couldn’t recall what song he played. His expression became grave because he could sense that something wasn’t right. As he tried to play the Phoenix Heart Song, the environment gradually became illusory and all of the holy maidens disappeared.

“Young Master, stop playing.” An Liuyan’s charming voice sounded like she wanted to attract his attention.

But Lin Yun ignored her and continued to play the song until everyone disappeared. He found himself in a pavilion, and there was an ancient lamp. When he walked forth, he immediately recalled everything.

“How terrifying!” Lin Yun’s consciousness became clear. Everything was a dream, and he deeply sank into the dream the moment it began. He sunk so deep that he couldn’t even differentiate the dream from reality. The first one was an erotic dream, and the corner of his lips twitched. He began to wonder if the Crane Fairy did it on purpose.

As he stepped forth and lit the lamp, the dream began to shatter. But as Lin Yun tried to recall it, the shattered dream came together with various holy maidens flaunting their figures.

“The dream is too realistic!” Lin Yun came to his senses because the dream was really realistic. But he was lucky that he came to his senses in time and didn’t fall for it again.

In the outside world, the Crane Fairy exclaimed in surprise, “Impressive! He woke up from the dream in just one day!”

There were seven gems beneath the lamp, and the moment Lin Yun lit up the lamp in his dream, one of the gems became dim.

“He’s still too slow,” Tian Xing said. “The nightmare will be next.”

“Master, look!” The Crane Fairy exclaimed because the already dimmed lamp was about to light up again, and this made Tian Xing stumped, wondering if Lin Yun was about to be drawn back into the erotic dream again. But when the gem ultimately dimmed down, Tian Xing and the Crane Fairy heaved a breath of relief.

Lin Yun sat before the Seven Dipper Lamp in the pavilion. A breeze would occasionally blow past, and Lin Yun’s expression began to change.

Roughly ten-odd minutes later, the last gem became dim and Lin Yun opened his eyes to the various phenomena appearing in the surrounding clouds.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his pupils shone brightly, and this scene shocked the Crane Fairy just when she wanted to speak. The sea of clouds was split into two under Lin Yun’s gaze before being divided into four and eight.

In the next second, the sea of clouds was ripped into pieces under his gaze as starlight exploded from him.

“Sword intent! That’s the Astral Sword Intent that has reached the pinnacle of complete mastery!” The Celestial Fairy exclaimed because she could sense a horrifying sword intent coming from Lin Yun. At the pinnacle of complete mastery, the legendary Astral Sword Intent could kill from a distance away since it could merge with everything, like the eyes. Lin Yun did that earlier as he released his sword intent through his eyes.

“Ye Qingtian, you have succeeded!” The Crane Fairy said excitedly. Ye Qingtian only seemed to be twenty-five this year, and yet he could already bring the Astral Sword Intent to the pinnacle of complete mastery. Many saints were unable to reach this stage for at least hundreds of years.

Although Lin Yun had the help of her master, he wouldn’t have been able to succeed if he didn’t have extraordinary talent and strong willpower.

Lin Yun nodded, “Senior, how many days did I take?”

“Seven days,” Tian Xing said.

Lin Yun opened his mouth and asked, “Doesn’t that mean there’s only two days left until the Blue Dragon Record?”

“Yeah. Everyone from the Heavenly Dao Sect has left. Someone came to look for you, but I stopped them,” Tian Xing said.

Lin Yun immediately stood up, wanting to leave since he had little time left. It would be a pity if he missed it, and the Blue Dragon Record wouldn’t wait for him. But before he was about to leave, Lin Yun asked, “Senior, the Heavenly Dao Sect might run into trouble.”

He wanted to tell Tian Xing that the Blood Moon Sect might make a move against the Heavenly Dao Sect, and this had something to do with the Wang Clan.

Three thousand years ago, Tian Xing was the Sword Emperor of that generation and sect master of the Heavenly Dao Sect. So he might have a solution to this situation.

But surprisingly, Tian Xing said calmly, “The Heavenly Dao Sect doesn’t have a sect master most of the time because of ‘Heavenly Dao.’ The Heavenly Dao Sect has faced countless crises over the years, and it was destroyed more than once in history. But it has managed to come back again in the end.”

“Because of the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword?” Lin Yun asked.

“No, the people,” Tian Xing said. “As long as the people still exist, the Heavenly Dao Sect can be rebuilt again, even in ruins. The Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword aren’t only protecting the Heavenly Dao Sect but the entire Kunlun Realm. They might not even make a move if the Heavenly Dao Sect was about to be destroyed.”

Lin Yun was stumped when he heard that. Wouldn’t that mean that it would be troublesome for the Heavenly Dao Sect?

“You don’t have to worry about that. If you want to become the sect master, bring back the Emperor Sword. As long as someone is willing to become the sect master and can bear the weight of ‘Heavenly Dao,’ the Heavenly Dao Sect will return,” Tian Xing said.

“If there’s an opportunity, I will bring back the Emperor Sword,” Lin Yun said. He wasn’t afraid of bearing the weight of ‘Heavenly Dao,’ but he had no interest in becoming a sect master. He was a swordsman, and he didn’t want to be restricted. He just wanted to walk around with his sword. Furthermore, he also wasn’t suitable to become a sect master, but he could try and bring back the Emperor Sword.

“Good,” Tian Xing smiled. He waved his hand, “Go on, you can leave now. Someone is waiting for you below.”
