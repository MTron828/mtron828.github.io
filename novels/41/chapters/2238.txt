Chapter 2239 - Swordsman Won't Lie To Another Swordsman

“Flower Burial, hold it!” Ying River King’s voice came from nearly a thousand miles away, which sounded ethereal from the echoes.

“Lin Yun, leave immediately! That person is tough to deal with!” Lil’ Purple’s voice anxiously resounded from the Iris Secret Realm. She might like to boast but would never be rash when there were dangers.

Lin Yun could already sense it even without Lil’ Purple’s reminder. The Ying River King seemed to have turned into a bright moon with moonlight shining down, and it looked like a domain was spreading out. The crimson radiance looked strange, as though it was slowly restricting the surrounding space.

“Lin Yun, let me go quickly!” Kui’ertuo laughed and continued, “Otherwise, you’ll die when the Ying River King comes!”

“How noisy!” Lin Yun snorted as he snapped Kui’ertuo’s neck and used Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent while pointing his finger to reduce the remaining eyeball into ashes. Lin Yun would further ensure that the Demonspirits were dead by destroying their vertical eyeball.

“Ying River King, let’s meet again in the future!” Lin Yun coldly said as he looked at the approaching moon. He was naturally unwilling to leave just like that because the Demonspirit Clan knew more about Su Ziyao than the Asura Dove King. He was initially planning to keep Kui’ertuo alive to interrogate him.

But it looked like he was running out of time and could only leave because this wasn’t the time for him to fight the Ying River King.

After Lin Yun left, a white-clothed figure appeared ten-odd breaths later. His face sank as he looked at the remains on the ground, and his fists clenched.

“Flower Burial, good! You killed my clansman, destroyed my demonic corpses, and snatched my Othershore Flower.” Flames blazed within the Ying River King’s eyes with cold, murderous intent brewing. If he had known about this beforehand, he wouldn’t have fought the Asura Dove King first and killed Lin Yun instead.

The Ying River King furiously threw a punch on the ground and the surrounding space cracked, creating a crater that was close to a thousand meters. There was nothing in the crater, not even spiritual energy. Watching Lin Yun’s receding figure, the Ying River King’s face was ugly. “It’s a pity that I was one step slower.”

If Lin Yun had stayed here for another moment, his Nethermoon Domain would’ve enveloped this region. At that time, Lin Yun would have been like a bird trapped in a cage, and the Ying River King was confident about dealing with Lin Yun even if the latter brought out a Sovereign Saint Artifact.

“That fellow seems to have some relationship with the Ninth Princess…” The Ying River King’s eyes processed all the information he had obtained before he shook his head. If he could capture Lin Yun, he might be able to force Su Ziyao to show herself before dealing with them both. But it was a pity he couldn’t catch up with Lin Yun anymore. He couldn’t imagine how a Quasi-Saint could be so fast.

Reality proved that Lin Yun left in time, and that he wouldn’t have had much odds if he clashed with the Ying River King.

A bright sun was swiftly traveling through the horizon. Once the radiance had dissipated, it was revealed that the sun was actually Lin Yun. Ever since he cultivated with the Serene Dust Great Saint, his Divine Sunchasing Art had come in contact with the profundity of space, reaching a whole new realm. So his top speed wasn’t inferior to a third-stage Saint Lord.

After Lin Yun landed on the ground, he entered the Iris Secret Realm. The Asura Dove King had witnessed how Lin Yun killed the two Saint Lords from the Iris Secret Realm, and he became nervous when he saw Lin Yun coming in. Before his injuries recovered, he didn’t dare to have ulterior thoughts.

“Flower Burial has given me a huge shock after killing two Saint Lords who were at the pinnacle of the second-stage. You’re the reincarnation of the Sword God, and you have won my admiration,” the Asura Dove King smiled.

“Hmph, carry on flattering him,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

The Asura Dove King awkwardly scratched his head, and smiled, “I’m not flattering him, I mean it.”

“Interesting.” Lin Yun looked at the Asura Dove King, causing the latter to feel chilly because he didn’t know where he had spoken wrongly. Lin Yun noticed that the crimson light that was in the Asura Dove King’s eyes had become dim, replaced with a spiritual light. In a nutshell, he looked more like a human now.

“Lil’ Purple, you’ve given him the Mandala Fragrance?” Lin Yun asked.

“I gave it to him the moment we came in,” Lil’ Purple replied.

The Asura Dove King’s heart skipped a beat as he looked at Lin Yun nervously, fearing that Lin Yun might discover something.

Lin Yun smiled. He didn’t pursue it, but asked, “You’ve fought the Ying River King, so what do you think of his strength?”

Seeing this, the Asura Dove King heaved a sigh of relief that Lin Yun hadn’t discovered his secret. He said, “He’s at the pinnacle third-stage of the Saint Lord, but he has grasped the Lunar Dao. That moon earlier is his Nethermoon Domain that uses the Lunar Dao. Just this alone, he’s practically invincible amongst the Saint Lords. Most importantly, he’s still young and is a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit. After fighting him, I only realized how frightening he was, and that he’s unfathomable.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thought and asked, “What odds do I have if I fight him?”

The Asura Dove King hesitated, pondering for a long time before he replied, “He might be strong, but you’re not bad yourself. If you two fought, he might be unable to do anything against you.”

Lin Yun knew it should be flattery from the Asura Dove King, and the latter probably wanted to say that he had no odds of winning. He asked, “What about you and I?”

“With my strength, I have at least a ninety percent chance of winning when facing anyone who’s at the same cultivation as long as they’re not a monster like the Ying River King,” the Asura Dove King analyzed seriously. “But I’m nothing compared to you, and I can’t even block a sword from you even at my prime.”

“Well said.” Lin Yun smiled. He didn’t bother exposing the Asura Dove King’s lies and asked, “How much strength did you have left when we fought?”

“Barely ten percent. When I gave it my all at the end, thirty percent,” the Asura Dove King said honestly.

“How much strength do you have left?” Lil’ Purple asked a sharp question.

The Asura Dove King was heavily injured and still had Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent left in his body. So he was naturally not comparable to his prime, and he was only one step away from death before the two Demonspirits came.

“Why bother asking? I might not have much knowledge, but I can tell that this secret realm is special,” the Asura Dove King asked. “Even at my prime, I probably couldn’t do anything here, and I would only be courting death. Since Flower Burial has spared my life and given me Mandala Fragrance, he must have something that requires my help. As long as Flower Burial requires, I will do everything possible. Then again… the Mandala Fragrance…”

Mentioning the Mandala Fragrance, he purposely tried to show the desire in his eyes. He felt Lin Yun wouldn’t believe what he said. So, he might act the opposite to paralyze Lin Yun’s judgment. When his strength recovers, everything would be his!

Lin Yun wore a playful gaze and smiled, “I do have something I need you for. I will give you another droplet of Mandala Fragrance after you’re done refining what you have.”

“Lin Yun!” Lil’ Purple frowned anxiously. “The Mandala Fragrance is precious and he cannot be trusted. I have a feeling that he must be plotting something.”

The Asura Dove King looked calm when he heard that, but he felt nervous.

“We’ll see if he’ll behave himself, and I do have use for him. Let’s go out first.” The group left the Iris Secret Realm, and Lin Yun continued, “Where’s the Blood Flame Plains?”

Lin Yun speculated that if Su Ziyao hadn’t left the Heavenly Void, she must have gone to the Blood Flame Plains. She wouldn’t take a loss this easily, based on her personality.

“The Blood Flame Plains is the heart of the deity’s corpse, and we will run into many Blood Crow Kings along the way, including some forbidden grounds,” the Asura Dove King said. “Such as the Bitter River, and you might enter the Fallen God Valley if you carry on. If you fall into it, even a ninth-stage Saint Lord won’t be able to survive. For example, there are multiple vipers there. They don’t have any intelligence, but they’re extremely dangerous since they were stained with divine blood and sins. This place, for example…”

Lin Yun listened to the Asura Dove King’s explanation and had a rough understanding of the Heavenly Void. He pondered and asked, “You weren’t this cooperative back then.”

“I had no choice back then, but I accept it now since you’re willing to give me the Mandala Fragrance. Naturally, I won’t hide anything from you; we’re both swordsmen. So we won’t lie to each other,” the Asura Dove King said.

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling when he heard the last part. He said, “I won’t treat you badly if you’re willing to follow me, and I can even help you restore your strength. I can even give you things you cannot obtain in the Heavenly Void.”

The Asura Dove King was shocked with disbelief.

But seeing that the Asura Dove King didn’t believe him, Lin Yun reached out and extracted all the Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent that was in his body.

This immediately relieved the Asura Dove King, and he could freely control his saint energy and sword sutra. This meant that he could recover from his injuries quickly. But he instantly became uncertain because he couldn’t see through Lin Yun and had no idea what he was planning.

But he tossed it to the back of his mind. He just had to recover to his full strength and crush Lin Yun; but for now, he would wait. With a sincere expression, he said, “Thank you, Flower Burial. I will lead the way now.”

After he took the initiative to lead the way, Lil’ Purple reminded, “Lin Yun, aren’t you taking it a little too far? He won’t be that obedient.”

Lin Yun wore a mysterious smile, “A swordsman won’t lie to another swordsman. I’ll believe him, for now.”

“You scumbag!” Lil’ Purple was furious because she could tell that Lin Yun was hiding something from her.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
