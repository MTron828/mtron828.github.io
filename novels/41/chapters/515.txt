Chapter 516 - Annoyance

Lin Yun’s words left everyone shocked. If this was Lin Yun’s first time seeing the Infernal Mountain and River Painting, then it would be too shocking. Not only was the painting perfect, but he even added a wind spiritual rune. In the academy’s history, there weren’t more than five individuals with such monstrous talent.

Many geniuses could tell the flaw in the Infernal Mountain and River Painting, but none of them could fill the flaw. Even Mo Ling wasn’t able to do it. A spiritual diagram was created with hundreds of spiritual runes linking together. So even the slightest mistake could destroy the entire painting, not to mention adding a spiritual rune to it.

This was the reason why everyone felt that this was unbelievable. How could Lin Yun accomplish this when he only just saw the Infernal Mountain and River Painting for the first time? Even Gu Teng, who wanted to embarrass Lin Yun on the stage, wore an ugly face. Lin Yun’s painting was a resounding slap to his face.

“How is this possible! This is definitely not your first time seeing the Infernal Mountain and River Painting!” Gu Teng barked at Lin Yun with his face turning red.

“That’s enough,” Mo Ling looked at Gu Teng coldly. She continued, “This is indeed his first time seeing the Infernal Mountain and River Painting and I can be sure of that. Flower Burial, you’ve really impressed me.”

Everyone sucked in a cold breath when they heard that. That was too unbelievable, but they had no choice, but to believe it since Mo Ling verified it.

Lin Yun was slightly surprised. He didn’t expect that this woman, who tried to make things difficult for him, would be so honest. He smiled, “Since that’s the case, then what about my reward?”

“Here you go…” Mo Ling wanted to throw her painting over, but she was stopped by Lin Yun.

“I don’t want that.” Lin Yun tugged his arms together as he looked at Mo Ling with a smile. “Do you think that this painting can compare with mine?”

“You!” Mo Ling’s face turned black. Looking down on her painting before so many people made her furious and her chest heaved up and down from the anger.

“Senior Sister, I want it,” said Gu Teng with expectation.

“Are you even qualified?” retorted Mo Ling. However, she said that without even looking at Gu Teng.

Her refusal left Gu Teng in an awkward position because this was too embarrassing. He had been looked down on by Mo Ling in public. This was all because of Lin Yun. His eyes were filled with killing aura as he glanced at Lin Yun.

“Then there’s no reward since you don’t want it. I’ll be taking this spiritual diagram first. Come to the Nightcloud Hall tomorrow on time. Or else!” Mo Ling waved his hand and gave a threatening glare at Lin Yun. She then took Lin Yun’s painting and left.

This instantly made Lin Yun smile bitterly in his heart. Not only did he miss his reward, but he even lost his spiritual diagram. He had a perfect performance this time, but he wasn’t sure if he could do such a perfect painting again.

Originally, Mo Ling’s departure should’ve put a close to this matter, but Mo Ling’s words made everyone think. She’s ordering Lin Yun to meet tomorrow?

“Deacon Lin is truly impressive. I’ve never seen Senior Sister Mo suffer such a huge loss.”

“Yeah. We can’t understand what Deacon Lin drew previously. However, when we think about it, how can you add a wind spiritual rune in it without disrupting the order. Instead, we were laughing at you. How shameful.”

“Sorry for what I said earlier.” Everyone else on the stage was filled with admiration for Lin Yun as they cupped their hands. Without a doubt, Lin Yun had displayed his shocking talent. So it was naturally a wise choice for the disciples to create a good relationship with him.

Lin Yun didn’t think too much about it as he was someone who would treat others how he was treated. Since they were smiling at him, then he would naturally smile back at them.

“Flower Burial, how impressive!” Just when everyone was smiling, a piercing voice sounded out. It came from Gu Teng, who had been forgotten by everyone. His face was dark as he gnashed his teeth. Anyone could imagine how furious Gu Teng must be right now.

Everyone’s faces changed when they saw this scene. Lin Yun’s expression was calm because he wasn’t interested in the thoughts of someone defeated by him. He simply turned around and left.

“Stop it you dog!” Gu Teng wore a sinister expression as he continued, “If Senior Sister Mo hadn’t interfered, I would’ve already crippled you. You want to leave after embarrassing me? You must be naive!”

Facing Gu Teng with his back, Lin Yun’s face turned cold with a smirk. Things are getting interesting now. Did Gu Teng really think that he could do anything to him? Lin Yun turned around and smiled, “Then I’ll take a look and see who’s the naive one. I’ll stand right here and see how you cripple me.”

Lin Yun didn’t expect trouble after he just resolved one problem. Then again, it wasn’t surprising. It would be surprising if Gu Teng let it go given his arrogant character. Previously, Lin Yun had merely sat in his position by mistake, yet Gu Teng wanted him to lick the seat. Now that he was embarrassed publicly and mocked by Mo Ling, it would be weird if he would let it go so easily.

“One’s in the lesser Yin stage, while the other in the pinnacle Yin stage. The gap between them is huge.”

“Senior Brother Gu is a pinnacle second grade spiritualist. Lin Yun still shouldn’t know how to use spiritual diagrams to attack.”

“Gu Teng is a little too much. He’s a sore loser.” Many people began to feel worried for Lin Yun. Lin Yun’s performance previously had won many people over, and now, Lin Yun was in danger while facing Gu Teng.

Gu Teng sneered, “Country bumpkin, you’re truly arrogant. Forget it. Let me show you the foundation of a quasi-overlord force!”

The foundation of a quasi-overlord force? Lin Yun sneered inwardly. Gu Teng might be slightly stronger than Mo Ling’s cousin, so the Dragon-Tiger Fist wouldn’t be able to suppress Gu Teng. But that didn’t matter.

Before Lin Yun could even think more about it, Gu Teng had already charged over. Gu Teng soared into the sky as he threw a punch out, “Mountain Shatter Fist!”

Pouring his origin energy into his fist, Gu Teng was like a divine weapon that could split a mountain into two.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he saw this scene. The Mountain Shatter Fist was somewhat familiar and it seemed somewhat similar to his fist and sword fusion. But there was also a difference because Gu Teng’s fist technique seemed to be comprehended from an ancient divine artifact.

Lin Yun's competitive spirit was aroused as he suppressed the thoughts to draw his sword. Along with a dragon and tiger’s roar, Lin Yun faced Gu Teng head-on with his fist. The two clashed together in the sky as they barraged their opponent with punches.

The rumbling collision made the entire ground tremble. This made everyone’s faces change as they quickly retreated. The two were simply too quick.

Right at this moment, a figure was sent flying away. When that figure landed on the ground, he had blood dripping down from his lips. It was Lin Yun. It seemed like Gu Teng’s foundation was truly impressive.

“Not bad,” smiled Lin Yun as he wiped the blood off his lips. His injuries weren’t serious, but he had to admit that the Dragon-Tiger Fist was lacking in comparison.

“You’re courting death!” Gu Teng’s eyes flashed with ferocity. He didn’t know where Lin Yun got his confidence from after being sent flying in fifty punches. With his aura rising to the peak, he charged over like a bolt of lightning, “Kneel!”

His attack instantly caused a commotion and everyone’s faces changed. Gu Teng’s Mountain Shatter Fist had clearly reached complete mastery. He was truly worthy of being the strongest among the inner disciple.

But right at this moment, a sword buzz rang out as a sword appeared in Lin Yun’s hand that pointed at the center of Gu Teng’s brows. It looked as if Gu Teng had delivered himself to Lin Yun. At the same time, Gu Teng’s aura had dropped to rock bottom from this abnormal scene.

Only Gu Teng knew that Lin Yun had found the flaw in his attack. He cursed inwardly as he quickly retreated. But before he even landed on the ground, he charged forward like a bolt of lightning. But a similar scene appeared once more. Whenever Gu Teng approached, the sword would point at the center of his eyebrows.

Gu Teng had gathered all his strength, but he couldn’t unleash it at all. This made Gu Teng’s face red as he heart beat wildly. His eyes were bloodshot and filled with reluctance. But he had no choice but to retreat.

Looking at Lin Yun’s playful gaze, Gu Teng spread his arms apart. While he was in mid-air, spiritual runes began to appear around him along with a terrifying aura like a ferocious beast.

“Spiritual diagram?” Lin Yun’s eyes blazed with fighting spirit as the Flower Burial Sword trembled in excitement. He could finally see how the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples attacked with spiritual runes.

Raising his eyebrow, Lin Yun wore a smile on his face. He just hoped that he wouldn’t be disappointed.
