Chapter 750 - Unavoidable

“The Mountainshaking Demonic Ape!” Lin Yun was also surprised since he met this demonic beast a few days ago back in Inkwater City. Although Lin Yun managed to stall for time, many people ended up dying. Lin Yun was surprised that this fellow managed to charge through the Heavenly Soul Realm experts and monstrous geniuses.

Wu Xiaotian and the rest weren’t pushovers since they were heaven-defying geniuses. But Lin Yun’s face changed when he looked in their direction because a few more overlord demonic beasts had appeared. The appearance of the overlord demonic beasts had ruined the balance between cultivators and demonic beasts. It was so bad that even Wu Xiaotian was having difficulty holding down his front. Everyone was fighting at least two demonic beasts, which was too much to handle.

This was why the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape managed to charge over. The Mountainshaking Demonic Ape unleashed a ferocious roar as the demonic aura in its pupils turned into black flames. This caused a terrifying chill to come from him.

It suddenly stopped attacking as it looked towards a certain direction before baring its fangs. In that split moment, everyone could sense the rage growing in the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape.

“What’s going on?” Everyone was trembling in fear as they began to run.

“How troublesome.” Lin Yun narrowed his eyes as the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape eyed him. In their previous encounter, he only managed to push the demonic ape back. Although he made a breakthrough with his strength and cultivation, he still didn’t want to fight this fellow. After all, he didn’t want to reveal too many of his trump cards.

But while he assessed the situation, the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s colossal figure descended in front of him. At this moment, everyone knew that they would die if this demonic beast attacked them.

The Mountainshking Demonic Ape swung its stone pillar with great agility and smashed anyone that got close.

Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to push the Seven Profound Steps to the limit and left behind dozens of afterimages. When the stone pillar hit the ground, a black shockwave spread out that reduced many demonic beasts into ashes.

Simultaneously, it also smashed dozens of Lin Yun’s afterimages. Seeing that the shockwave was about to reach him, Lin Yun swung the Flower Burial Sword to cut the black shockwave apart.

“This fellow actually became stronger?” Lin Yun was shocked as his attack was slower than before even after he had grown stronger.

“Not good, the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape is going after that swordsman.”

“The demonic beast is smart since it knows who can threaten it.”

“It’s probably because that swordsman is too dazzling.”

“He needs to run. The Mountainshaking Demonic Ape is too powerful.” Others didn’t know the grudge between Lin Yun and the demonic ape, and they weren’t optimistic of his chances.

As the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape roared, its attacks began to rain down like a violent storm. Although the attacks hit the ground, there was little damage done to the ground. This meant that the demonic beast had brilliant control of it’s attacks.

Lin Yun was caught within the demonic aura, which didn’t feel great. All he could do was avoid the attacks and defend himself. Occasionally, a sword ray would land on the demonic ape, but it would only cause a shallow wound.

“Its defences have grown more powerful.” Lin Yun frowned. He knew that it would be difficult if he didn’t bring out the quasi-spiritual sword intent.

“Abyssal Sword!” Right at this moment, a figure charged towards the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape. His sword ray manifested a terrifying vortex that enveloped the demonic beast. The newcomer was Ji Wuye who decided to join the fight.

Although Ji Wuye’s attack managed to force the demonic ape back a few steps, it didn’t suffer any injuries. It was actually able to use it’s fur to weaken Ji Wuye’s attacks.

“Lin Yun, let’s continue our competition and see who can kill this Mountainshaking Demonic Ape first,” said Ji Wuye. He was determined to compete with Lin Yun once more for a favorable outcome.

The ground trembled and the demonic ape swung the stone pillar in its hand. It’s demonic aura instantly enveloped Lin Yun and Ji Wuye. To protect themselves, they circulated their origin energy, but not even Lin Yun’s sword intent could disperse the demonic aura.

“Not good.” Lin Yun knew how terrifying the demonic aura was. It was corroding his origin energy and affecting his movement technique. If he was hit by the stone pillar, he would either be crippled or killed.

After all, this was an overlord quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast that was a lot stronger than them. With no means left, a dragon roar echoed out of Lin Yun’s body as dragon runes began to squirm on the surface of his body. In the blink of an eye, sixteen lightning pythons wrapped around his body.

Lin Yun’s figure flashed as he attacked and tore a few holes in the demonic aura. Ji Wuye unleashed a brilliant sword ray at the black demonic aura, but his outcome wasn’t as fortunate.

A dragon roar rang out as it collided with the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s pillar head-on. The sword ray and demonic aura shattered at the same time, which made Ji Wuye’s face turn pale. Ji Wuye had to charge out of the black demonic aura after his failed attack. But even so, neither he nor Lin Yun had any intentions of retreating.

“What courage. The two of them are actually joining forces against the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape!”

“It won’t be easy. The demonic ape is too terrifying unless a genius like Wu Xiaotian comes. But even so, Wu Xiaotian won’t be able to kill this demonic beast.”

“That’s right. The two of them are probably doomed.” Right at this moment, a crimson fist radiated in the sky and landed on the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s body. The demonic ape was forced to take a few steps back as its demonic aura was penetrated. It was even left with a few burn wounds on its body.

“What powerful flame intent!” Lin Yun was shocked as this attack definitely came from someone who had awakened their martial intent. Otherwise, it would be impossible to injure the demonic ape.

“It’s the Profound Yang Palace’s Chief Disciple, Qin Yang!”

“He came to assist. Otherwise, all the geniuses here will die.” Everyone finally felt relieved upon seeing Qin Yang.

“Ji Wuye, your senior brother asked me to tell you not to court death.” Qin Yang was blazing with flames and his power was like a boundless ocean, which meant he must’ve cultivated his technique to a high level. Otherwise, the difference in their origin energy wouldn’t be so big when there wasn’t a huge difference in their cultivation.

Qin Yang’s eyes blazed with flames as he looked at the demonic ape. The Mountainshaking Demonic Ape was considered a pinnacle existence, even among overlord demonic beasts. So Qing Yang couldn’t imagine the value if he could kill it, which was why he offered to rescue Ji Wuye. After all, there was no one who could compete with him here.

Ji Wuye wiped the blood off his lips with reluctance, but he knew that Qin Yang was speaking the truth. As Qin Yang’s aura was more terrifying, it temporarily diverted the demonic ape’s attention from Lin Yun to Qin Yang.

As flames disappeared, Qin Yang used a powerful movement technique to dodge the demonic beast’s attack before throwing his fist down, “Profound Yang Sun!”

Boundless flames gathered onto his fist that emitted a might comparable to the sun. His attack was further empowered by his flame intent before he smashed it towards the demonic ape. His attack left a huge crater on the demonic ape’s chest along with burn wounds.

The immense pain made the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape roar, which hurt everyone’s ear drums. The demonic ape’s face was twisted at the moment from Qin Yang’s attack. The observers were shocked by Qing Yang’s power as he made the demonic ape suffer a huge loss. “What power!”

Qin Yang didn’t let this opportunity go and soared into the sky with flames that turned the ground red.

“The Profound Yang Art?” Lin Yun recognized this cultivation technique before he frowned his brows. After all, he didn’t have a good opinion of the Profound Yang Palace, so he decided not to interfere in the fight.

But right at this moment, a bizarre scene occurred as the flesh on the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s back began to squirm and a pair of large wings unfolded. The wings radiated with metallic luster as it flapped its wings and extinguished the flames on the ground.

Although the wings couldn’t carry the demonic ape, it could increase its speed as it threw a punch at Qin Yang. This caught Qin Yang by surprise and he spit up some blood before flying away from the impact. When he landed on the ground, the impact killed hundreds of demonic beasts around him.

Then, the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape turned to look at Lin Yun once more. With its colossal figure and wings, it looked even more terrifying than before. Upon seeing this, many people froze.
