Chapter 607 - Getting Through the Trial

The two puppets had a similar cultivation, but the puppets wore cosmic artifacts as their armor that was also engraved with ancient spiritual runes.

Lin Yun launched the first attack as he used the Seven Profound Steps to leave behind golden afterimages. Then, he stabbed out with the spear empowered by his xiantian sword intent in lesser mastery. The spear left sparks along with fine cracks on the armor. However, it failed to inflict any serious injuries on the puppets.

But before he could draw himself out from the fight, a long spear stabbed over that pierced through the air. The other puppet, on the other hand, slammed its spear down.

There was no change to Lin Yun’s face as he retreated, defending himself with the spear in his hand like a sword. The sword aura in his spear was strong, which prevented the two puppets from taking another step forward.

Several moves later, Lin Yun’s eyes glowed brightly as he pushed his xiantian sword intent to greater mastery. In the next second, the spear in his hand lit up brightly like a star in the night. When the spear stabbed onto one of the puppet’s chest, it sent the puppet flying with a huge crack on its armor. As sparks flew, Lin Yun could see shattered spiritual runes being damaged by his sword intent.

“I’ll roughly need two more attacks with xiantian sword intent at greater mastery. The power of this spear is impressive,” muttered Lin Yun as he looked at the puppet’s armor. This was ultimately a trial and it would make no sense if the armor was too powerful. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Right at this moment, Lin Yun spread his arms apart as he dodged the spear that came at him from behind. It was as though he had a pair of eyes behind him. But that wasn’t all as Lin Yun turned around and stabbed out with the spear in his hand before he even landed on the ground.

When the spear came in contact with the puppet’s chest, the puppet braced for impact against the explosions on its armor. Meanwhile, its spear was directed at Lin Yun’s chest, but it had stopped half an inch away from Lin Yun’s chest.

Moon Reflection!

Lin Yun tapped his foot on the ground and soared into the sky once more. As his body swayed a little, he split into nine afterimages as the puppet began to turn left and right, trying to find Lin Yun’s location. But it was a pity that it was destined to be a futile effort.

When the nine afterimages overlapped, Lin Yun stabbed the spear out at the puppet’s head. In the next second, the puppet’s head broke into many pieces. But what left Lin Yun surprised was that the puppet wasn’t dead after having its head destroyed. It still maintained its momentum as it charged towards him.

However, Lin Yun faced it easily by raising his head and giving it a kick, making use of the momentum to send himself further back before charging at the first puppet.

“Die!” After two spears, Lin Yun successfully pierced the puppet’s armor as it exploded into pieces on the ground.

Before the other headless puppet charged over, Lin Yun threw the spear in his hand without turning his head. The spear pierced through the puppet’s armor, pinning it onto the ground. No matter how the puppet struggled, it wasn’t able to break free from the spear. When Lin Yun walked over and pulled out the spear, the entire puppet crumbled into pieces.

After the second trial came to an end, the number of people who failed was double the amount of the first trial. When the elders outside the Withernorth Sea saw this scene, they had shock on their faces. They knew that the trial would be tough, but they never imagined that it would be this bad.

“The empyrean’s tomb is really tough. There are less than seven hundred people now.”

“There should be less. After all, some died in the journey to the tomb too. I bet there are only about four hundred people still in there.”

“Looks like less than ten people will make it through the last trial.” Very quickly, the third trial in the empyrean’s tomb began. This time, there were a total of three puppets and their strength reached the pinnacle Yang stage. Furthermore, their cosmic artifacts looked thicker than the puppets from the previous trial.

Moreover, the teamwork between the three puppets was a lot stronger as they barely held a formation. Lin Yun observed for a while more before noticing that the puppets weren’t able to use the formation perfectly. In fact, they could barely bring out one-tenth of its power. If one looked carefully, they would see many flaws in the formation. From this alone, Lin Yun expected that the formation would be more powerful in the later trials.

Lin Yun dealt with the three puppets in just fifteen minutes, but it was clearly harder for others. In another tunnel, Mu Chen was having a tough time facing the attacks of the three puppets and his face was pale.

The puppets were in the pinnacle Yang stage, but they weren’t too terrifying individually. But it was an entirely different matter when they worked together.

“Damn it. This is only the third trial…” Mu Chen’s forehead was covered in sweat as he gasped for air. He had suffered a huge setback in this trip to the Withernorth Sea. First, he was humiliated by Chen Hou. Then, he almost kneeled before Ji Wuye. To top it all off, he still felt ashamed after he witnessed Lin Yun’s strength.

Before he came to the Withernorth Sea, he had designs of spreading his name throughout the Ancient Southern Domain. But reality was brutal since he wasn’t even able to get past the third trial.

“This won’t do! At the very least, I need to last until the fourth trial!” He hadn’t obtained any precious treasure from the previous two trials and he didn’t want his efforts to go to waste.

In another space, Bai Lixuan looked at the three puppets charging at him with a smile, “It’s a little tough...but it’s impossible to hold me back!”

“Break!” Bai Lixuan’s aura suddenly exploded and he unleashed sword rays onto the puppets. After a few attacks, Bai Lixuan roared as a saintly pressure emitted from his body and formed bewitching purple flames that enveloped the three puppets. In the next second, the three puppets crumbled into pieces.

While everyone was going through the third trial, Lin Yun had already finished searching the third level and was headed for the fourth trial. His objective was clear, complete all the trials to get to the main tomb.

On the fourth level, there were four puppets that were utilizing profound movement techniques. The aura from their spears was like a dragon that roared and wanted to devour Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with surprise because it was exactly as expected. When there were four puppets, the might of the formation had gotten a lot more powerful.

Facing this attack, Lin Yun stomped his foot on the ground and created cracks. Lin Yun barked and he threw out a punch that combined his physical strength and origin energy, “Omnipresent Anger!”

After a huge explosion, Lin Yun took two steps back. Meanwhile, the four puppets were also blown back by his punch. With that, the attacks from the four puppets had weakened.

“There are still flaws…” Lin Yun took two steps back and his sword aura prevented the four puppets from connecting their attacks. He even charged into the fray and fought the four puppets.

In a split second, there were countless silver sword rays tearing the armor of the puppets apart. After reaching the Yang stage, Lin Yun’s origin energy was a lot more refined and he could easily throw out his finishing moves. “Heavenly Cloud Shatter!”

The Heavenly Cloud Shatter turned into a boundless tornado that swept out and enveloped the four puppets. When the Heavenly Cloud Shatter ended, only pieces of the puppets were left behind. With that, Lin Yun passed the fourth trial successfully.

“I’ll probably have to use half my strength during the fifth trial. Let’s see if I can find any treasures on the fourth level. I can also refine the Infernal Flower to bring my cultivation to the greater Yang stage directly,” muttered Lin Yun.

If anyone was here, they would definitely find Lin Yun insane. After all, Lin Yun had just reached the Yang stage, so wanting to make a breakthrough so quickly was simply a pipe dream. But Lin Yun had an Infernal Flower with him. If he combined the flower with the ancient pellets he found in the tomb, there was a huge possibility of him reaching the greater Yang stage.

His breakthrough with the Profound Yin Water made his foundation incredibly firm. So he wasn’t afraid that his breakthrough would be too soon. If he could reach the greater Yang stage, he would definitely be able to give Ji Wuye a huge surprise if he bumped into the latter again.

By now, most of the third trials had come to an end and about two hundred people were transported to the border of the Withernorth Sea. When they were teleported out, each of them had unwillingness on their faces.

“Mu Chen!” Tang Yu noticed Mu Chen among the crowd. Clearly, Mu Chen had failed the third trial.

“Lin Yun still isn’t out?” asked Tang Yu. Even Mu Chen, who was in the greater Yang stage, had come out. But Lin Yun was still nowhere to be seen. Tang Yu was worried that harm had come to Lin Yun.

“At the very least, he will reach the eighth trial,” sighed Mu Chen.

This… The elders of the Heavenly Province Academy, including Tang Yu, were shocked. Lin Yun had the ability to reach the eighth trial? Could it be that he was comparable to the elites on the Dragoncloud Ranking? Wait, even most of those elites on the Dragoncloud Ranking didn’t have that capability!
