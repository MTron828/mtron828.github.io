Chapter 2416 - White-Clothed Sword Immortal

Hearing Feng Qingyu’s words, Lin Yun’s facial expression became weird because that phrase sounded familiar. He sounded like his senior brother, Ye Guhan. But Feng Qingyu couldn't be Ye Guhan, so he exclaimed, “You’re from the Kunlun Realm?”

He didn’t think about that before because Feng Qingyu called him Flower Burial right from the start. He initially thought this person was a genius of the ninth testing ground.

“Why don’t you take a guess?” Feng Qingyu smiled.

Lin Jiangxian was shocked because even Profound Sky Venerable couldn’t stop the Qilin Sword Immortal, but this white-clothed youth easily brought them away. So, what was this person’s strength? Moreover, this white-clothed youth didn’t fear the Qilin Sword Immortal, judging from his tone.

One must know that the Qilin Sword Immortal was the strongest existence beneath the Deity realm, and even some deities didn’t dare to provoke him. This was because he had reached a high mastery of the sword. Was there such an expert from the Kunlun Realm?

The other cultivators on the stage were also shocked and had no idea where this white-clothed youth came from.

“Where did you come from, pretending to be a young man? You dare stop me?” The Qilin Sword Immortal looked at Feng Qingyu coldly, unleashing his sword intent. Everyone could hear a sword vibration that sounded like an ancient bell, and their souls nearly dissipated from the reverberation. The terrifying aura the Qilin Sword Immortal gave off focused entirely on the white-clothed youth. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

But Feng Qingyu wore a smile and snapped his fingers with a fire lighting up. The light might seem weak, but it dispelled all the darkness on the stage.

The pressure on Lin Yun and Lin Jiangxian disappeared, and they were amazed. They had experienced how powerful the Qilin Sword Immortal was, sending over two thousand cultivators back from the spatial passage.

“Who are you?” The Qilin Sword Immortal frowned. “Why did you poke your nose in my affairs?”

“I already said that you’re lacking to teach Flower Burial,” Feng Qingyu smiled.

“I’m not worthy? Are you worthy, then? Let me teach you a lesson!” The Qilin Sword Immortal charged over.

“Come!” Feng Qingyu laughed as he stepped forward, and a sword appeared in his hand. When he held onto the sword, everyone felt a gale blowing past them, forcing them to close their eyes. That was also the case for Lin Yun, who could only raise his hand to cover his eyes.

As Feng Qingyu clashed with the Qilin Sword Immortal, the sword rays they released were like two bright suns, causing the entire Star Observation Stage to tremble. The nearby Divine Alliance’s elder barely held his ground while the nearby array couldn’t withstand the shockwave from their sword rays.

The Qilin Sword Immortal was clearly careless and was forced to retreat by the white-clothed youth, taking a few steps back before he managed to regain his footing.

“You’re too weak,” Feng Qingyu smiled.

The Qilin Sword Immortal’s face became cold as he charged over, while Feng Qingyu merely stood on the ground without moving, easily receiving the Qilin Sword Immortal’s attacks. He would occasionally retaliate, which shocked the Qilin Sword Immortal.

“Where did this white-clothed swordsman come from?” Lin Jiangxian was shocked as she looked at Lin Yun. To fight the Qilin Sword Immortal evenly, this white-clothed youth was at least a Sword Immortal as well.

Lin Yun had a speculation, and said, “If he’s from the Kunlun Realm and knows me, he can only be one person. But if he’s that person, I can’t figure out how he left the Kunlun Realm.”

The Heavenly Path was severed, and it was practically impossible to leave the Kunlun Realm. Lin Yun had relied on an ancient teleportation array to leave, and that array was restricted by one's cultivation and age. But as Lin Yun recited Feng Qingyu’s name in his heart, he soon figured it out and squinted, looking at the white-clothed youth. He was now sure that Feng Qingyu was the same person he had speculated.

“Blooming Stars!” Feng Qingyu laughed as he performed the third section of the Divine Firefly Sword. As thirty-six figures flew out from him, they swung their swords, and each sword further divided into thirty-six afterimages, repeating the process repeatedly.

When countless sword rays overlapped, they filled each corner of the surroundings. All the flower petals exploded as Feng Qingyu raised his sword above him. When a sword ray was released from him, the two sword rays clashed with everyone on the stage retreating. The defensive array exploded as the two sword rays lit up the entire Taotie City, causing this star to tremble violently.

Everyone’s faces changed because this might not be inferior to a deity. Taotie City might not be as massive as other realms, but it was a star, and the star showed signs of collapsing.

“What the hell...” Profound Sky Venerable was shocked. He knew that the Qilin Sword Immortal was strong, but who was that white-clothed youth? If he remembered correctly, this person appeared beside Lin Yun during the Heavenly Barren Banquet, eating and drinking happily. He thought that this person was a genius and didn’t overthink about it.

“Please stop. Taotie City can’t bear the two of you fighting, and there will be many casualties if your fight continues.” The Divine Alliance’s elder yelled as he barely maintained the array.

Feng Qingyu and the Qilin Sword Immortal’s faces changed as they stopped. Feng Qingyu looked casual, but the Qilin Sword Immortal’s face was changing. Feng Qingyu smiled, “You can’t blame me for it. He started it first.”

The Qilin Sword Immortal was silent for a long time, before he said, “It looks like I can’t bring him away today with you around. Forget it.”

The Qilin Sword Immortal no longer cared about Feng Qingyu and approached Lin Yun, taking out a golden jade slip. He handed the jade slip over and cupped his fists at Lin Yun before leaving, “This is my comprehension over the years, and I have written them down. This is called the Qilin Sword Canon, and you can flip and look through it if you're interested. I won’t be taking you back to Qilin Mountain, then.”

When Lin Yun held onto the jade slip, it felt heavy in his hands. But before he could react, the Qilin Sword Immortal came over to Feng Qingyu, and said, “This place isn’t convenient. If you’re free, we can find a place to fight again. I have guessed the origin of your sword technique. As expected of the place that the Sword Ancestor once stayed.”

“Sure.” Feng Qingyu smiled, “You’re not bad, either. Don’t put my teasing to heart, and we’re friends as long as you don’t take that brat away.”

“I was reckless,” the Qilin Sword Immortal said before he left.

Lin Yun stepped forth, with Lin Jiangxian following behind him. Profound Sky Venerable briefly pondered before choosing not to follow as well. Lin Yun’s eyes shone brightly, and he cupped his fists together, “Greetings, Senior.”

“You recognized me?” Feng Qingyu smiled.

Lin Yun nodded. He had doubts earlier, but if you turn the name around, Feng Qingyu was Yu Qingfeng. This white-clothed swordsman was the Kunlun Realm’s Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng!

Lin Yun naturally rejoiced to see someone he knew, so he asked, “How did you leave the Kunlun Realm?”

Feng Qingyu smiled, “I didn’t leave the Kunlun Realm. Speaking of which, I’m the same age as you now, and my name is Feng Qingyu.”

Lin Yun was shocked upon hearing that. Reincarnation? Or a clone?

“It’s complicated to talk about, and you can consider it my opportunity. The Kunlun Realm was an Ancestral Realm, and we can naturally find opportunities there, even if the Heavenly Path is severed,” Feng Qingyu smiled. “Don’t overthink it. It was a coincidence for me to meet you. I came across your name in the Heavenly Barren Banquet and decided to look before seeing you, our famous Flower Burial.”

“Senior, please don’t tease me,” Lin Yun smiled awkwardly. Yu Qingfeng had helped him greatly when they first met on Profound Wither Island, not to mention that Yu Qingfeng protected him outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Even if this Sword Emperor once severed the two peaks of the Sword Sect, Lin Yun still had respect for him. This was why he was emotional when he saw him here. He asked, “You have been following us?”

Feng Qingyu nodded, “You will return to the Kunlun Realm for sure. I’m just a deserter and can’t reforge the Heavenly Path. So I naturally can’t see you being taken away by the Qilin Sword Immortal.”

Lin Yun nodded, “I will do my best with the Heavenly Path. But I hope that Senior can help in my master’s tribulation!”

If the Sword Emperor was willing to make a move, no one would dare to move during his master’s tribulation.

Feng Qingyu bitterly smiled, “Haven’t I been helping? I can figure out why he’s going through his tribulation now, so how can I sit by and watch? The Sword Clan abandoned him, so how could he still be alive if no one looked after him?”

Lin Yun was stumped before he came to his senses.

“Go back. I’m still in the Kunlun Realm, and I’m willing to see your master become an Emperor. I will wait for his challenge in Skysolute city. Do you know what I mean? I will make a move when it’s my turn!” Feng Qingyu said.

Lin Yun nodded and heaved a sigh in relief. He looked at the jade slip in his hand, and asked, “What should I do with this?”

Feng Qingyu looked at the jade slip and smiled, “Why not? It’s free, either way. I might not like him, but he’s right that I’m not his opponent if we fight now.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun stowed the jade slip. He asked, “Senior, can I ask you a question? What’s the origin of Tian Xuanzi?”

“I have told you the answer before.” Feng Qingyu winked, and smiled, “Guess it yourself. Be careful not to be killed by him.”
