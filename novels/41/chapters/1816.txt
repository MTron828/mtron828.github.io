Chapter 1817 - Thunder Black Tortoise Underground Palace

After Lin Yun’s party left, there were three people standing on a mountain on Profound Thunder Island. If Lin Yun saw them, he wouldn’t be unfamiliar with them because they were the three God Generals of the Eastern Desolation’s Blood Moon Sect.

The leader of the party had long red hair with fringe draping down on his forehead. In his eyes behind the fringe, there were flame runes revolving within, emitting a terrifying aura. While looking in the distance Lin Yun left in, he asked after a long time time had passed, “He’s Lin Xiao, the Nirvana Banquet’s champion?”

“That’s him…” Ao Feng and Yan Cangming nodded their heads with ugly expressions. They were both at the Samsara Edict Realm, reaching the third Profound Life Stage. But they were trembling in fear and didn’t dare to raise their voices before the red-haired youth.

This was because the red-haired youth was the strongest of the three God Generals, the Fire God General.

“It’s interesting that he dares to come to the Black Tortoise Void Sea when he’s not at the Samsara Edict Realm.” The Fire God General wore a playful smile.

“He’s strong, especially his sword intent!” Lightning God General Ao Feng said with lingering fear.

“I can see that. It’s no wonder why you two lost to him, bringing humiliation to the God General title.” The Fire God General said. God Generals have a high position in the Blood Moon Sect, and one has to pay a great price to become one. After all, this meant that they had to eliminate everyone to obtain it.

The Blood Moon Sect only had a hundred and eight God Generals in the Kunlun Realm. Only three God Generals were active in the Eastern Desolation, this didn’t mean that there were only three in the Eastern Desolation. When the two God Generals crawled out of the Martial Dao Tea Party, it was a great humiliation to the Blood Moon Sect, causing a great uproar. This also meant Lin Xiao’s name had spread out in the Blood Moon Sect.

“What should we do now? Should we make a move now?” Ao Feng gritted his teeth.

“There’s no need to hurry. He’s only a small fry.” The Fire God General said with his eyes squinted.

Lin Yun’s group of four executed their movement technique and arrived in a secluded forest an hour later.

“Young master, is there anyone still looking at us?” An Liuyan asked.

“Not for now.” Lin Yun sensed with his Sword Heart, and most of the people have already left. The sword intent was sensitive to gazes from others, and it would ring his senses. After that youth wearing a bamboo hat left, Lin Yun could sense most of the gazes disappearing.

“Is that the person we saw on the Black Tortoise Ship?” Mei Zihua noticed the youth’s existence, since the latter didn’t bother concealing himself.

But Lin Yun shook his head and replied, “There are others, and they might be from the Blood Moon Sect…”

He had interacted with the two God Generals, and he was pretty familiar with their aura. But even so, he didn’t dare to be certain about it.

“It should be the Fire God General!” An Liuyan said nervously with lingering fear in her pupils.

“Is the Fire God General that terrifying?” Lin Yun asked. This was the person An Liuyan was worried about, and this was the reason why she didn’t want him to come to the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

“The Fire God General is strong, but it’s still not that terrifying if he’s alone.” An Liuyan explained. “I’m worried that they will take revenge for what happened at the Martial Dao Tea Party. The Blood Moon Sect is powerful, and their branch in the Eastern Desolation alone has the power to resist holy lands. Not to mention that they have the Seven Saint Acolytes, and then there are the Holy Sons above them.”

Lin Yun didn’t understand much about the Blood Moon Sect, but he did hear about the Holy Son before. The Crimsonmoon Elysium was a subordinate force of the Blood Moon Sect in the Profound Amber Realm, and the Blood Moon Sect had Seven Holy Sons. Only the Holy Sons had the qualifications to compete for the position of the Divine Son, and they would become servants to the Divine Son for eternity the moment they failed.

“I don’t think the holy sons will show up here.” Lin Yun said. The Holy Sons’ cultivation was definitely above the Profound Death Stage, so they couldn’t come to the Black Tortoise Void Sea unless they sealed off their cultivation. But the risk in doing so was too great.

“What should we do now?” An Liuyan asked.

“Wait and see what other changes appear from the Black Tortoise Underground Palace. If it’s still in the Dead Sea, we might as well just leave.” Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of death, but he wasn’t stupid. He wasn’t stupid enough to barge into the Dead Sea for the Thunder Black Tortoise inheritance.

“Okay.” An Liuyan nodded.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun looked at the demonic clouds a distance away. It was as though there was something terrifying hidden in the darkness that could put even saints in danger if they entered. After all, that was the forbidden zone, the Dead Sea.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Over the next few days, Lin Yun and his party went into seclusion, and the Profound Thunder Island became even more bustling. Those who could make it here weren’t weak because those weaker ones wouldn’t even have the qualifications to come here.

As more Profound Life Stage experts arrived, Profound Thunder Island became even more chaotic. Many of them were demonic cultivators, and there was some feuds amongst them. So, while waiting, there would occasionally be fights taking place on Profound Thunder Island.

Many people lost their lives in just a few days, which was weird. This was because no other place would have people dying before the opportunities appeared. But it was normal in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea, and the heart of the Eastern Desolation didn’t have an actual ruler to suppress everyone.

Thus, fights would occur throughout the world, and there were no rules outside Heavenly Domain City. After seven days have passed, Lin Yun slowly opened his eyes to see a tree. When he raised his head, he could see countless people heading in that direction. The entire Profound Thunder Island was like a slumbering beast that woke up, emitting various powerful auras.

“Something seems to have changed with the underground palace.” An Liuyan said.

“Let’s go and take a look.” Lin Yun stood up and gave An Liuyan a smile before he dashed forth.

Mei Zihua had been sleeping quietly. He quickly opened his eyes and dashed over.

Seeing this, Gu Jun smiled before taking a mouthful of wine and closely followed behind them, “Young men are really energetic.”

After he flew out of this secluded forest, it instantly captivated many people’s attention. But their minds were on the Black Tortoise Underground Palace. Not to mention An Liuyan was beside him, so they continued their journey to the Black Tortoise Underground Palace after taking a few glances.

After a while, Lin Yun’s group of four stopped in mid-air beyond Profound Thunder Island. When they raised their heads, they could see a massive underground palace appearing at the far end of the horizon. The underground palace was shrouded in different colored lightning, and the bolts of lightning were like huge palms lifting the entire underground palace into the air.

As lightning roared in the distance, it could be heard even from more than a hundred thousand miles away, and this made everyone’s hearts tremble.

“It seems to have left the Dead Sea.” An Liuyan said.

Lin Yun nodded his head. The underground palace was hovering above the sea, so it could barely be considered to have left the Dead Sea. But it was still hovering on the edge. If they wanted to reach it, they would have to take some risks.

An Liuyan, Mei Zihua, and Gu Jun turned to look at Lin Yun, waiting for him to make up his mind. Without them knowing it, Lin Yun had become the pillar of this group.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed brightly, and he soon made a decision. When the four executed their movement techniques, they turned into four streaks of light that flew across the horizon, shaking everyone behind them.

A long time later when sonic booms echoed, everyone then raised their heads and could see lightning rumbling in the sky. It wasn’t at all inferior to Lin Yun’s tribulation, and this made everyone feel terrified. Occasionally, bolts of lightning would fall from the sky, causing huge craters on the ground with lightning flying around.

“It’s really the Thunder Black Tortoise’s inheritance.” Lin Yun said with a grave expression, and he couldn’t help turning to look at Gu Jun.

“I’m just making a random guess.” Gu Jun smiled awkwardly.

Under the lightning, countless people flew over, approaching the Thunder Black Tortoise Underground Palace.

Lin Yun briefly stopped before he charged into the depths of the Dead Sea. He could see many people heading in the same direction.

“The lightning there is too terrifying…” Mei Zihua said with a pale expression. His cultivation was the weakest, and he also didn’t temper his physique. Not to mention that his tribulation was the easiest amongst everyone here. Thus, he had never seen lightning of such a scale before.

Lin Yun also nodded his head, acknowledging what Mei Zihua said. He had just undergone his tribulation, and the energy here wasn’t any weaker than his own tribulation. If they weren’t careful, everyone heading towards the Thunder Black Tortoise Underground Palace would lose their lives on the spot. Even without thinking about it, many lives would be lost.

But even despite knowing that it would be dangerous, it didn’t stop everyone from heading towards the Thunder Black Tortoise Underground Palace. After all, who wouldn’t want to rise and become the center of attention in martial dao?

“There’s no need for you to come along with your identity. This place isn’t suitable for you.” Lin Yun said. Mei Zihua was the son of one of the Ten Musical Clans, so he didn’t have to put his life at stake for this opportunity. After all, the opportunity here might not even be comparable to something casually given to him by his clan’s seniors. It was brutal, but it was very realistic.

“What do you mean? Are you looking down on me?” Mei Zihua questioned.

“In this world, there are some people who are destined to stand at the top of the pyramid from birth, standing where everyone fights for their entire lives and could never reach. This is normal, and there is nothing unfair about it. I’m only speaking the truth.” Lin Yun said.

“An Liuyan, let’s go. Be careful.” Lin Yun traveled with An Liuyan. When he saw Gu Jun, who wanted to sneak away, he grabbed onto the old man’s shoulder and said, “Senior Gu, you don’t have to be humble. No one is more familiar with this place than you.”

“Don’t bullshit. I’m really not a descendant of the Black Tortoise.” Gu Jun struggled.

“Black Tortoise’s descendant?” An Liuyan asked in shock, to which Lin Yun merely smiled and did not say anything.

Seeing this scene, Mei Zihua was conflicted. He was stronger than most people here, and he also had a lot of treasures. But he had never seen something like this before. Or rather, he never experienced life and death, so this naturally made him afraid.

After all, he could rely on his face to resolve many issues in the Divine Dragon Empire. Who in their right mind would offend the descendants of one of the Ten Musical Clans? But he ultimately made up his mind to follow and gritted his teeth, “Isn’t it just a region of lightning tribulation? What am I afraid of!”

The group became cautious, and increased their speed before they finally arrived in the region where the lightning was the most ferocious. The lightning that fell here was on a completely different level than the tribulation Lin Yun just experienced.

But this region was vast, and there was plenty of room to dodge. When ten bolts of lightning descended from the sky, a fourth stage Profound Life Stage expert was struck by them. That person only lasted briefly before he was reduced to ashes.

This scene made Lin Yun take in a cold breath, and his face became solemn. There weren’t any safe regions here, and it was a few more times more terrifying than his tribulation. They could occasionally hear people screaming, and some were struck by lightning releasing, miserable howls.

Even with their dragon origins and profound life auras, they weren’t able to last long. After they were struck down one by one, they would attract the other lightning bolts with ten falling down.

“Old man, do you have a way?” Lin Yun asked, looking at Gu Jun.

But the old man stared at the underground palace as though he didn’t hear what Lin Yun said. He murmured, “Something isn’t right. Why does this palace feel like it was forcibly brought out, and it still isn’t the time for it to appear…?”
