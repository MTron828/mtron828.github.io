Chapter 2297 - I Can Bear It

“Senior, are you joking with us?” Bai Lixuan asked anxiously after a long time.

“Little girl, what did the princess actually say? You have to take responsibility for what you said,” Drifting Goblet also couldn’t help roaring. He couldn't imagine what would happen if the Ninth Princess didn’t return.

“Hey, watch your tone,” Lin Yun spoke out.

Drifting Goblet was briefly stunned, then smiled, “Sorry about it, but it’s really hard to believe.”

Seeing Lin Yun protecting her, Lil’ Purple inwardly rejoiced, but she coldly said, “I’m not a petty person, and it’s natural for young men to be easily emotional.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched.

“You’re Drifting Goblet, right?”

“I am.”

“This is your Ninth Princess’ token. She said that seeing this is the same as seeing her. She told me to tell you that you will lead the Blood Word Battalion, and you two will manage it together,” Lil’ Purple said as she threw out a medal.

When Drifting Goblet held onto the medal, his face changed.

“It’s the Blood Word Medal.” Bai Lixuan couldn’t help looking at Lin Yun with a complicated look and asked, “Is it because of him?”

Lil’ Purple replied, “What do you think?”

“This is surprising… but it’s also not surprising simultaneously.” Drifting Goblet sighed, accepting this outcome.

“Let’s talk.” Lin Yun looked at Drifting Goblet. The latter was stunned before he came with Lin Yun to a corner.

Drifting Goblet panicked a little in his heart and faked a casual smile, “Go on. I can accept it, just like in the Great Qin Empire’s palace.”

As he spoke, he took out his wine jar to calm his emotions.

“We got married before the Divine Mulberry Tree beneath the Fallen God Valley,” Lin Yun said.

Drifting Goblet spewed the wine in his mouth, looking at Lin Yun with shock. He wanted to smile, but he couldn’t smile no matter how he tried. He finally couldn’t continue his act and charged at Lin Yun, “You bastard! How many times has this been? Why are you always stabbing me in the heart?!”

Lin Yun didn’t dodge and allowed Drifting Goblet to vent his emotions, waiting for him to calm down. He knew that Drifting Goblet was in love with Su Ziyao. He and Su Ziyao knew that. Drifting Goblet had known Su Ziyao earlier than Lin Yun.

But Drifting Goblet knew it was impossible between him and Su Ziyao, which was why he had never dreamt about it before. It was enough if he could protect her while being by her side, so he stayed with her in the Blood Word Battalion and the conflict in the royal clan.

“I owe you a jar of wine,” Lin Yun said.

“You must be dreaming.” Drifting Goblet sent a ferocious look at Lin Yun, “One jar isn’t enough, at least ten! They have to be at the same level as Millennium Flame, or I won’t acknowledge it.”

“Alright,” Lin Yun smiled. There was nothing between them, and Drifting Goblet was already prepared for this day to come.

Lin Yun said, “The Blood Word Battalion is in your hands. Since she got Lil’ Purple to deliver the message, the Blood Word Battalion must be important to her. Believe me.”

“I believe you,” Drifting Goblet nodded. He then shared with Lin Yun what the Blood Word Battalion had experienced for the past few years. The entire Blood Word Battalion worshipped Su Ziyao and was loyal to her. The Blood Word Battalion was a special force, even within the Divine Dragon Empire. It didn’t look at the origin of someone but their talent and contributions. The Blood Word Battalion was also a thorn in the eye for many.

The Blood Word Battalion carried the hope of countless people, and it also had its inheritance. Aside from Su Ziyao, the Blood Word Battalion had its experts. This was why Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan were shocked to hear that Su Ziyao wouldn’t return. This wasn’t just about disobeying orders but involving the interest of many. After all, many people had their eyes on the Blood Word Battalion since it could even fight a holy land.

“But since the Ninth Princess has opened her mouth, I will look after the Blood Word Battalion. I guarantee that no one can touch it,” Drifting Goblet gave his guarantee.

A few minutes later, Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple bade their farewell. Bai Lixuan was filled with emotions and looked complicated as he watched Lin Yun’s departing figure. He recalled what Lin Yun said in the Profound Amber realm. “You can’t catch up with me!”

Over the past few years, he didn’t dare to relax and experienced countless life and death. But he didn’t expect the distance between him and Lin Yun to increase.

“Drifting Goblet, he’s already a Sword Saint. Can you imagine it?” Bai Lixuan asked. “The disciple from the Sword Firmament Pavilion who you taught the Dragon-Tiger Fist has reached such heights today.”

“I also never expected it. He might only be a second-stage Saint Lord and pale in comparison to the geniuses in the Divine Dragon Empire, but he has grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent and a Sovereign Constellation. Not to mention that his accomplishment in sword technique is unprecedented,” Drifting Goblet sighed.

Bai Lixuan suddenly thought of something and asked, “What do you think will happen when the Sword Emperor’s lineage learns about this?”

“It will probably be interesting. They’re prideful, thinking they’re unrivaled in the sword,” the Drifting Goblet smiled.

As they talked, Bai Lixuan couldn’t hold back, and asked, “Drifting Goblet, what did Lin Yun tell you?”

Drifting Goblet patted Bai Lixuan’s shoulder, and said, “Heed my words. Don’t ask because you won’t want to know.”

Bai Lixuan’s lips moved, but he said nothing.

“Focus on cultivating. Based on your contribution, you can stay in the Blood Purgatory Pavilion longer this time,” Drifting Goblet said. The Blood Purgatory Pavilion was a time-space treasure; a year was equivalent to one month in the outside world.

Lin Yun carried the sword box and bumped into Ye Guhan along the way. He asked, “Senior Brother, you’re done chatting with the Last Sky Great Saint?”

Ye Guhan smiled, “What is there to talk between us? He wasn’t willing to tell me and thought that I didn’t know about the origin of the 72 Earths, claiming that the Eight Imperial Clans controlled it.”

Lin Yun was baffled when he heard that.

Ye Guhan looked around and said, “Where’s that senior?”

“There’s no senior. You met her before in the Heavenly Dao Sect, that little girl,” Lin Yun smiled.

When she heard that, Lil’ Purple unhappily grumbled from within the Iris Secret Realm.

“I see…” Ye Guhan smiled.

“What’s with the 72 Earths? Why did you talk about it with the Last Sky Great Saint?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

Ye Guhan replied, “I have long discovered that the two Saint Sovereigns from the Divine Phoenix Mountain knew something about that title and asked about it. But the Last Sky Great Saint wasn’t willing to share and simply brushed me off.”

Lin Yun muttered, “72 Earths… Does that mean they are special?”

“That’s for sure. Don’t forget that our master is from the Jian Clan, but I know nothing about the 72 Earths. So it’s not under the control of the Eight Imperial Clans,” Ye Guhan said confidently. He continued, “You can ask that little girl. Her origin must be complicated since this title cannot be given casually, even if she had only heard about it. So you should ask her again.”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Lin Yun couldn’t bear to tell Ye Guhan that Lil’ Purple had always bragged this way. He replied, “I’ll ask about it.”

He changed the topic and told Ye Guhan his objectives in going to the Divine Phoenix Mountain this time.
