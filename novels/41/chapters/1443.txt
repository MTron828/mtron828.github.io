Chapter 1444 - Friendly Spar

“What’s with those scriptures?” Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple with a grave expression. He was practically sure that Lil’ Purple had secrets kept from him concerning the Iris Sword Saint.

Many times, he didn’t want to directly ask about it. He knew it was futile even if he got to the bottom of it when he didn’t have enough strength, and he understood this logic long ago. But he had to make it clear today because the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron was a ticking time bomb in his body. He was sure that it was a demonic cauldron. If he wasn’t careful, he would become its vessel.

Lil’ Purple silently looked at Lin Yun before she ultimately explained, “The scriptures are an ultimate martial technique related to the sword. It involves the ancient secrets of the Divine Dragon Era. You can’t comprehend or control it with your current strength, and I don’t know anything else.”

An ultimate martial technique related to the sword? Lin Yun furrowed his brows. He wasn’t accepting that because it wasn’t enough to satisfy him. But he briefly sorted his thoughts, since he had to swiftly resolve the problem, “Alright. But how do I deal with it? It devoured too much astral saint dust, and I can no longer suppress it. It’s also weird, and I feel that I’ll become the cauldron’s puppet if I used its power.”

Lil’ Purple already predicted what Lin Yun would say and replied, “Didn’t I tell you before? This cauldron exists globally, and the cauldron in your body is equivalent to the soul. Since you managed to form the soul, the cauldron will naturally be able to sense it. After all, that’s the soul of a demonic cauldron…”

But her explanation left Lin Yun shocked. He couldn’t believe there was such a cultivation technique in the world.

“Otherwise, why do you think the Iris Sword Saint could slay deities when he’s only in the Saint Realm? Aside from nirvana intent and the seven sovereign divine runes, he also possessed the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron!” Lil’ Purple continued. “Similarly, you can as well once you can control it.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that, pondering over what Lil’ Purple said.

“It’s easy to resolve your current situation. You just have to cultivate another sword sutra.” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun and said, “It doesn’t accept you now because you’re too weak. But because you have the firmament sword intent, it won’t turn against you. This is why this empress has never put it in my heart, since it will someday become a tool you will use. Besides, it can’t play any tricks with this empress around!”

“You’re pretty confident in yourself.” Lin Yun helplessly smiled as he looked at Lil’ Purple. He knew he wouldn’t get anything more out of her.

“That’s for sure. After all, I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!” Lil’ Purple said.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he heard that and knocked her hard on her head.

“Ouch! That hurts!” Lil’ Purple robbed her head with tears welling in her eyes.

“Stop bragging. I’ll knock you on your head every time you brag in the future. Hurry up and sleep!” Lin Yun smiled as he pinched her on her cheeks.

But Lil’ Purple flew into a rage, having her cheeks pinched, “You scumbag! I’ll take revenge for this one fine day!”

“Haha! I’ll be waiting!” Lin Yun laughed as he headed to the cultivating chamber. He knew that he would cause a huge commotion in the Sword Sect with him becoming a heaven direct disciple. After his fight with Chen Ling, Lin Yun now understood the strength of the Sword Sect’s disciples.

Chen Ling was already strong, which meant that those direct disciples on the Earth Ranking would be stronger. He didn’t want to be defeated since he wouldn’t only embarrass his master, but the sect master as well.

Taking a deep breath, light gradually surfaced in his pupils as he recalled what Mu Xuankong said to him. Lin Yun was determined to let everyone know he had the strength to become a heaven direct disciple.

Sitting down on a mat, Lin Yun took out the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead from his interspatial bracelet. A smile rose on his lips because this gift from An Liuyan was much more convenient than interspatial pouches.

“Should I refine it now?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. It had been a long time since he made any progress in his firmament sword intent, since it had been stuck in the lesser mastery for a long time. He heard that the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead had a slight chance of letting someone grasp the firmament sword intent, but Lin Yun had already grasped it.

“Let’s put it to the side for now…” Lin Yun ultimately stowed the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead. He planned on using it to make a breakthrough when his firmament sword intent reaches a bottleneck. It would be a waste even if he refined it now because it wasn’t enough to allow his firmament sword intent to reach greater mastery. Instead, it should be used in the crucial time which could benefit him the most.

After stowing the Spiritual Sword Bead, Lin Yun sat down and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. As astral energy coursed throughout his body, it gradually wrapped him in a golden glow. His cultivation soared when he was in the Saint Pool for the past month, so it was time for him to digest it now.

A golden elysium core hovered above the cauldron in his violet palace. On the elysium core, a Golden Crow Saint Rune was engraved on it. The ocean of astral energy had reached an unbelievable size of thirty thousand meters, and above the elysium core was a starry sky with one star shining brightly. This was the first star that Lin Yun had formed after reaching the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

It was rumored that the strongest Heavenly Elysium Core Realm expert could condense nine stars. When nine stars shone at once, it would create a terrifying phenomenon, boosting the astral energy within the body by nine folds.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye, when Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes in the cultivating chamber. The powerful aura he was emitting had dimmed a lot, but the sword aura hidden within his pupils became even more terrifying, waiting for the moment to be unsheathed.

“Someone's here?” Lin Yun could sense that someone was waiting outside the Cloud Soaring Peak for a long time before he opened his eyes. When he closed his eyes and gave that person a scan, he held onto his jade token and smiled. “Senior Brother Chen, come in!”

When Chen Ling heard a voice coming from the Cloud Soaring Peak, he raised his head to see the clouds splitting open, revealing the entire scenery of the Cloud Soaring Peak. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Half an hour later, Lin Yun met Chen Ling in a tea room at the top of the pavilion. As Lin Yun brewed a pot of tea for Chen Ling, he smiled. “Senior Brother Chen, it looks like you’ve been waiting for a long time.”

“Stop! You don’t have to call me ‘Senior Brother’ now. You’re more accomplished than me as a swordsman and a heaven direct disciple.” Chen Ling waved his hand because he couldn’t accept Lin Yun addressing him as ‘Senior Brother.’

“What’s the reason for your visit?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Nothing much. I just wish to thank you.” As Chen Ling spoke, he took out a fruit from his interspatial pouch. “This is the seed of a saint fruit. I had spent a lot of effort getting this some time ago, and I hope you can accept it.”

Lin Yun was touched when he saw this scene. He believed that this was the best treasure Chen Ling had with him, but it wasn’t that attractive to him. He didn’t even think that Chen Ling needed to give him something because it wasn’t much when he had previously helped Chen Ling. Not to mention that they were both disciples of the Divine Firmament Peak, so there was no need for them to be so calculative. But clearly, he also knew that he couldn’t refuse Chen Ling’s goodwill.

“The seed of a saint fruit? I’ll accept it. I’m looking forward to seeing what it will grow into in the future.” Lin Yun smiled. His smile wasn’t pretentious as he accepted the seed.

This scene also relieved Chen Ling, as if the knot in his heart was undone.

“Since that’s the case, I won’t disturb Senior Brother’s cultivation any longer.” Chen Ling also didn’t want to stay here for long. He knew Lin Yun must be under tremendous pressure with the commotion within the Sword Sect, and Lin Yun had to spend his precious time cultivating.

“Wait up.” Lin Yun stopped Chen Ling before briefly examining the latter, then he asked, “You’re now at the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, right? Why don’t we have a little spar?”

The Primordial Netherserpent Sword gave Lin Yun a deep impression because he nearly lost the battle because of it. He could sense that Chen Ling’s aura was at least four times stronger than before, which meant that he should have a greater control over his ghost spirit martial technique. Simultaneously, Chen Ling was also a ruthless person to himself, or he wouldn’t be able to learn this sword technique.

“I don’t think that’s appropriate…” Chen Ling hesitated.

“Oh?” Lin Yun was surprised to hear that.

“My advantage as a three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm is too big against you who’s still at the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. The difference between one and two stars isn’t that huge, but it’s a different story for three stars.” Chen Ling explained.

“You don’t want to bully me?” Lin Yun smiled after understanding why Chen Ling refused.

Chen Ling briefly pondered before he nodded, “I’ll be honest with you. My ocean of astral energy has reached nine thousand meters!”

“We’ll just be having a friendly spar. I want to see the difference between me and someone at the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. This will also help me understand those who are in the top ten on the Earth Ranking.” Lin Yun said before he pulled Chen Ling to the training ground.

The Cloud Soaring Peak had everything. The training ground was massive, and there was also a spiritual array that enveloped the area to ensure that not even Dragon Pulse Realm experts could inflict any damage here.

“Senior Brother Lin, you can go first, then.” Chen Ling wore a calm smile. “I’m no longer the same person I was a month ago.”

Seeing that Chen Ling was so confident, Lin Yun smiled. As his ocean of astral energy surged, Lin Yun disappeared before Chen Ling. Before Chen Ling could respond, a powerful gale blew over, causing his hair to flutter in the wind.

When Chen Ling came to his senses, Lin Yun already appeared before him with a smile. This made Chen Ling inwardly exclaim because Lin Yun was too quick. Sensing the danger, Chen Ling didn’t hesitate to push his palm forth, but Lin Yun easily avoided his attack.

Lin Yun merely swayed around and avoided Chen Ling’s palm. He smiled as his afterimages overlapped before throwing a punch out, “It’s my turn now.”

When Chen Ling took the hit to his chest, his cheeks twitched from the pain as he nearly fell to his knees.
