Chapter 2257 - Leaving The Valley

He asked this because Su Ziyao could withstand the pressure of his Sovereign Constellation with only the Indigo-Golden Dragon Aura, which made no sense. Even if Su Ziyao was at the Saint Realm, it shouldn’t be possible for her to withstand the pressure of a Sovereign Constellation unless she also possessed one.

Nodding her head, Su Ziyao said, “But my Sovereign Constellation was inherited, so I can’t be compared to you, who created his own Sovereign Constellation.”

“I’ll believe it for now,” Lin Yun smiled. He knew Su Ziyao was humble but not weak.

Over the next few days, Lin Yun continued to train on the island, spending his days carefreely. With the leaves of the Divine Blood Fruit, his cultivation had greatly improved. But he wasn’t surprised because he speculated that it shouldn’t be tough for him to reach the pinnacle of the Quasi-Saint Realm. As for reaching the Saint Realm, he would have to depend on opportunities, since it wasn’t something that could be reached with resources alone.

He had grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent, his two sword sutras had reached the ninth and fourth stages, and he had grasped his Sovereign Constellation. So aside from cultivating, Lin Yun would spend his time trying to comprehend the Eternal Dao, Nirvana Dao.

This was because if he could succeed, his strength would undergo an unimaginable transformation, becoming even more unfathomable than his three trump cards. After all, everything was nothing before nirvana. As long as fate didn’t come out, Nirvana Dao would suppress all the other Eternal Daos.

As Lin Yun practiced with his sword, he began to practice the Nirvana Sword Art. The Iris Sword Saint left this sword technique behind, the key to comprehending Nirvana Dao. According to the Iris Sword Saint, Lin Yun could find the Nirvana Seal that he left in the Iris Sword Box if he could reach the manifestation stage with it.

Even if Lin Yun couldn’t fully comprehend it, the sword technique could greatly boost his strength.

The first sword—Light of the Beginning.

The second sword form—Boundless of the Beginning.

The third sword form—Glory of the Beginning.

The fourth sword form—Eternity of the Beginning.

The fifth sword form—Darkness of the Beginning.

The sixth sword form—Nirvana of the Beginning.

Lin Yun was already proficient with the Light of the Beginning, bringing it to the deification stage. This sword came from Sword of the Beginning, so there was no difficulty for Lin Yun to master it.

The moment he swung his sword, it shone like the first ray of light in the world, splitting primal chaos apart. When he executed the second sword form, mountains and rivers appeared in this world along with vegetation. This sword had no trace, accompanied by a boundless energy, bringing life to this world.

When Lin Yun swung his sword the third time, the sun and moon appeared as Lin Yun divided himself into two using the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, each swinging a sword. The two sword rays intertwined, and the heavenly dragon and divine phoenix merged with the sun and moon.

Swinging his sword the fourth time, Lin Yun’s past was painted on this world by using heaven and earth, which made this sword seem realistic and flawless. This sword was like a legend that existed for eternity, with heaven and earth praising him for his deeds.

With the fifth sword, civilization disappeared along with the sun and moon as the world became dark.

“Nirvana…” Lin Yun was stumped after he was again stuck on the sixth sword form. Grasping the Divine Light Sword Intent gave Lin Yun a whole new comprehension of this sword technique, and he could easily execute the five sword forms at the pinnacle of the manifestation stage without an issue. But he was stuck on the last sword form and suddenly couldn’t execute the originally smooth sword technique.

Over the next seven days, Lin Yun’s cultivation reached the pinnacle of the Quasi-Saint Realm, with only one last step left. He had to merge the sacred flame, saint soul, and saint constellation together to reach the Saint Realm. As for the Nirvana Sword Art, he was still stuck at the last sword.

“This is too difficult…” Lin Yun muttered to himself, looking at the Flower Burial Sword. But the sword vibrated as though trying to comfort him, which made Lin Yun smile as he looked at the trembling sword.

“Lin Yun, don’t be too depressed.” Lil’ Purple came over, saying, “We're talking about Nirvana Dao, an Eternal Dao. It will continue to exist even if Heavenly Dao shatters, and it’s not easy to grasp. If I remember correctly, the Iris Sword Saint only grasped it after reaching the Saint Realm.”

Su Ziyao said, “Nirvana Dao is supreme as long as Fate Dao doesn’t appear. In the Divine Dragon Era, few have grasped the Nirvana Dao.”

“I want to give it another try,” Lin Yun smiled. He knew that they were trying to comfort him.

After seeing Lin Yun practicing the sword again beneath the Divine Mulberry Tree, Su Ziyao and Lil' Purple smiled, nodding at each other.

“It’s time for him to leave,” Su Ziyao said. This island was a great place to train, allowing Lin Yun’s strength to boost in such a short period. But there was no longer any meaning in them staying here any longer.

“Can you bear to part with him?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“What about you?” Su Ziyao replied with a question, wearing a smile on her face.

Lil’ Purple blushed, and aloofly said, “I don’t care about that scumbag.”

“I’ll tell him that,” Su Ziyao smiled, her eyes filled with affection when she looked at Lin Yun. She didn’t know what she liked about Lin Yun. She felt satisfied just watching him like this. It felt like all of the world's troubles have disappeared with her heart at peace.

“Those practicing the Empress Heart Sutra can’t fall in love to become an empress, fusing with Heavenly Dao. But if they fall in love, they would feel more pain the deeper they fall in love…” Su Ziyao muttered. “But that doesn’t seem right. If one has to be rid of all emotions, what was the point of becoming an empress and fusing with Heavenly Dao?”

Su Ziyao had been comprehending the Empress Heart Sutra when she was with Lin Yun, and she also received some comprehension. If one had to be rid of emotions like the Heavenly Dao, one could only borrow the power of it and not fuse with it. So, Su Ziyao decided to carry on this path despite the pain.

Three days later, Lin Yun and Su Ziyao strolled on the island and looked at the black vortex beneath the waterfall.

“The divine bone is down below?” Lin Yun asked. He already had a speculation when he saw the black vortex while falling down the waterfall.

“Yeah. That’s a complete handbone, and this deity probably had a huge origin. Referring to the ancient records of the Divine Dragon Empire, it might have been left behind by the Annihilation God Lord…” Su Ziyao continued, “This God Lord was famed for his palm technique, which is why his hand bone is so terrifying.”

“I see…” Lin Yun wouldn’t have known about that if Su Ziyao hadn’t told him. He soon frowned and said, “Even so, it’s hard for us to leave the Fallen God Valley, even with my Sovereign Constellation.”

He initially wanted to use the Sovereign Constellation to bear the pressure of the hand bone but didn't expect that this deity was proficient in palm techniques, meaning there must be a complete divine rune on the palm.

“Well, that’s the Annihilation God Hand, and if we can subdue it…” Lin Yun smiled as he spoke. After all, why would it be easy to subdue the hand bone left behind by a deity?

“That’s what I intended to do,” Su Ziyao said, to Lin Yun’s surprise.

Looking at Su Ziyao with shock, Lin Yun asked, “Are you sure about that?”

He didn’t mind letting Su Ziyao subdue it, but he was worried for her safety since she would lose her life if she wasn’t careful. Even with Lin Yun’s current means and trump cards, he only wanted to break free from the pressure coming from that bone hand. The thought of subduing it never crossed his mind.

“Don’t worry about it. I have my ways,” Su Ziyao smiled. She continued, “I already had a rough idea of how, but now I've gained a complete plan when Lil’ Purple came down.”

“The Solar Lunar Divine Rune?” Lin Yun asked. He had before heard that the Lunar Divine Rune was in Su Ziyao’s hands.

“That’s right.” Su Ziyao nodded. “I must borrow the Solar Divine Rune, the other Sovereign Divine Runes, and the Iris Sword Box. In addition to my means, I have a huge chance of subduing it.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered, then said, “I’ll help you out as well. After all, we’re already husband and wife.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When he held onto Su Ziyao’s hands, this made the latter feel warmth, and she smiled, “You have already helped me because my method was the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. I know you want to help me, but it will take some time.”

Lin Yun smiled, “It doesn’t matter. We’re stuck here anyway, and I can’t make a breakthrough with the Nirvana Sword Art. So I might as well help you find a way to subdue it.”

“What if I say that you can leave this place?” Su Ziyao smiled, giving Lin Yun a wink.

“Now?” Lin Yun was surprised.

Su Ziyao nodded, “Lil’ Purple has found a way from the Divine Mulberry Tree.”

“What about you?” Lin Yun asked. “How are you going to leave this place if you fail?”

“That brat will stay here with me. With her around, I will have a way to leave, so you don’t have to worry about it,” Su Ziyao said.

“Who are you calling a brat?” Lil’ Purple unhappily said.

Su Ziyao smiled, “The Lord Phoenix will stay behind with me. So you don’t have to worry about me.”

“Hmph.” Lil’ Purple snorted. She was only satisfied after Su Ziyao changed the way she addressed her.

Lin Yun smiled, “So the two of you have already discussed it amongst yourselves.”

“Isn’t it because of you? You have to bring the Divine Blood Fruit out and compete for the divine flames,” Lil’ Purple said with disdain.

“You have to try and compete for the divine flames. Even if you can’t, you must prevent the Blood Moon Sect from obtaining it. They can find a way to break the seal if they obtain the divine flames, even without the help of the Solar Lunar Divine Rune. At that time, a catastrophe will descend upon the Kunlun Realm!”

Lin Yun nodded, since he wasn’t a stubborn person. He soon thought it through and agreed to it. But it had only been a month since they married, and he would be lying if he said that he wouldn’t feel anything once they parted.

Lil’ Purple’s method was simple, which was to extract the saint liquid from the Divine Mulberry Tree and draw a Sun Divine Rune on Lin Yun by forging an armor with the tree. At that time, Lin Yun would be able to withstand the attack of the hand along with the pressure and reach the very top. It had some risks, but it wasn’t a big issue since Lin Yun possessed the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

“Will it work?” Even after wrapping Lin Yun with the Divine Mulberry Tree’s branches, Lil' Purple was concerned. After all, Su Ziyao said that the divine physique was nothing.

Lin Yun bitterly smiled since he didn’t know how to explain himself. He looked at Su Ziyao, “All thanks to you.”

“It’ll work,” Su Ziyao smiled.
