Chapter 502 - Battle

“He must be mad!”

“Let’s go quickly. We’ll all die when the Indigo Thunderpython becomes enraged later!”

Fear began to appear in everyone’s hearts. But Lin Yun didn’t think too much about it as he turned into a golden beam and shot towards the lotuses. When he reached out, he grabbed onto the first Indigoflame Goldlotus. But he didn’t stop right there as he reached out for the eight other lotuses.

“One more left!” Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto the last lotus as he reached out for it. But the moment he grabbed onto the lotus, the Indigo Thunderpython lashed its tail out like a whip, which sent him flying.

“No!” Liu Yunyan’s face changed when she saw this. She turned around and charged forward without any hesitation.

You can’t die! Liu Yunyan gnashed her teeth. But the entire lake was enveloped with lightning and flames, which made many people’s faces change as they got out of the lake. The environment was too dangerous and would be lethal if they were careless.

Amidst the torrential wave, a figure charged out, making Liu Yunyan rejoice because she recognized that it was Lin Yun. He was still alive! But he didn’t run in her direction, but instead turned to another direction.

Liu Yunyan instantly knew what Lin Yun was trying to do. The Indigo Thunderpython definitely wouldn’t let Lin Yun off so easily and Lin Yun didn’t want to lure it towards Liu Yunyan.

As the Indigo Thunderpython became enraged, the entire lake exploded and was instantly turned into a living hell. Those disciples who failed to make it out of the lake were instantly devoured.

Liu Yunyan swung her sword and split the surrounding waves into two. When everyone calmed down, they could only see a thick mist covering the lake. The roars of a demonic beast could vaguely be heard as the ground trembled.

The pressure beneath the lake had created a vortex that made Liu Yunyan’s face change. She quickly dashed away from her position because he was nearly devoured by it. However, when she landed, the surrounding waves came at her once again.

“Damn it! I really don’t know how I’ll explain this to that lass now…” Liu Yunyan helplessly swung her sword to create a path. She knew that she had to retreat right now or else she wouldn’t be able to leave anymore.

On the other side, Lin Yun’s face was pale with a bloodstain on the corner of his lips. He was running along the surface of the lake as a torrential wave chased after him. Suddenly, the entire region was enveloped in an indigo radiance, forcing Lin Yun to turn around. He drew his sword instantly to defend himself against the incoming bolts.

The colossal being was shrouded in indigo snake scales with its eyes brimming with killing aura and its horn flickering with lightning. The aura of an overlord beast made Lin Yun feel as though he was in quicksand, greatly weakening the Seven Profound Steps.

Shattering the last bolt of lightning with his xiantian sword intent, Lin Yun instantly retreated. The moment he moved, an indigo spear landed on the place he was previously standing.

The python released another roar and a horrifying pressure that created a wave of a few hundred meters. It felt as though the entire sky was going to collapse. Before the oppressive might, Lin Yun felt like an ant.

“I should've provoked this demonic beast, at least on the Indigocloud Lake.” Lin Yun was rather calm at this moment. He shook his wrist and held the Flower Burial Sword with a reverse grip. As the Iris Flower bloomed in his dantian, his silvery sword energy began to roar within his body.

When he slapped his palm down, everything felt slow, as if time had frozen. But in the next second, Lin Yun roared, “Great Wind Scripture!”

When his palm came in contact with the wave, the wave lasted for a brief second before it broke down. However, it didn’t stop there. The energy from his palm continued and threw the python in the air and caused it to roll several times.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up as he poured his sword energy into the Flower Burial Sword. The Flower Burial Sword turned into a silvery ray as it streaked across the horizon. In the end, the sword stabbed onto the python’s back.

Along with an ear-deafening howl, blood gushed out from the python. Lin Yun smiled when he saw this scene, but his smile only lasted for a brief second before it froze on his face. The Flower Burial Sword barely cut into the python. The attack that exhausted one-third of his origin energy had only caused such a light injury to the python.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun used the Seven Profound Steps and left afterimages on the lake. But it didn’t take long for his afterimages to be pierced by the lightning coming from the python. For a moment, the entire lake was covered in boundless lightning.

Lin Yun swung his arms backwards as he soared into the sky. He dodged the incoming spears and landed on the back of the python. Running across the back of the python, Lin Yun stabbed it with the Flower Burial Sword without any hesitation.

But even so, the sword only went two inches deeper into the python’s back than before. Regardless of the depth, the python was trembling in pain. This instantly made Lin Yun rejoice because he finally saw an opportunity to defeat the python. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Then, a powerful gale suddenly swept towards Lin Yun and he could barely maintain his footing on the python. When he raised his head, his face instantly turned pale when he saw the huge jaw biting down at him.

Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword to try and control his balance. Just when he was about to be devoured by the python, he pulled the sword out, splattering blood everywhere. This made the python tremble as it roared out in pain.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Lin Yun soared into the sky and got to a safe place. But before he could catch his breath, the python came for him once more.

Looking at the python, Lin Yun didn’t have any fear in his eyes this time. He was brimming with fighting spirits as he used the tenth move of the Aquaselenic Sword, Heavenly Cloud Shatter.

The lake suddenly exploded and a boundless sword aura rose from Lin Yun that formed a water tornado. Under the wild gale, the sky was torn apart. His terrifying xiantian sword intent gushed out against the approaching overlord Indigo Thunderpython.

In the next second, the two clashed and the ground trembled violently. Lightning and sword aura swept out into the surroundings.

With his origin energy exhausted, Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood from the shockwave. When he raised his head, the Indigo Thunderpython was sent flying and many indigo scales fell down. The python’s entire body was covered in wounds, but no matter how he looked at it, the python was still alive. They might be evenly matched up to this point, but Lin Yun had lost since he exhausted all of his origin energy.

“This bastard’s skin is too thick,” cursed Lin Yun as he instantly turned to run. He was never someone who would submit as long as he had one breath left. A violent gale chased after him as the python hunted him down.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he was a few thousand meters away from the shore. If he could get on the shore, the python would be slower on land. But Lin Yun was feeling a little weak with his origin energy exhausted and all the injuries he had accumulated.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun heard a familiar neigh. When he turned to look, he saw a crimson figure. When he got a closer look of the crimson figure, he saw that signature bucktooth.

“Lil’ Red!” Lin Yun began to laugh. He knew that Lil’ Red wouldn’t be terrified by Lu Siyin and that it would secretly follow after him.
