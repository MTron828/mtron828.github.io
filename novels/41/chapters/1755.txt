Chapter 1756 – Let’s Have Some Fun

Boundless sword rays pierced through heaven and earth, sounds of heaven shattering could be heard, and a powerful sword aura spread out. His flute was like a sword, and he used his melody to wield a sword.

As Lin Yun's flute melody echoed, his white robe fluttered in the wind. He was playing Sun and Moon. When his fingers danced on the flute, the sun and moon revolved before they exploded, causing the surrounding space to distort.

Everyone by the lakeside was shocked, looking at the white-clothed youth. Lin Yun’s sword aura exploded. This was something no one had expected. They were shocked that Lin Yun could still put up a fight with Mei Zihua, who opened the eyes of a Sovereign Constellation.

Furthermore, they could sense that Lin Yun’s sword intent was stronger than Firmament Sword Intent. So this pressure naturally made everyone’s faces change, and they guessed it was the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. This terrifying speculation rose in everyone’s hearts. After all, why did Lin Yun even bother to practice music dao when he grasped Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at such a young age?

As long as he showed interest, all the holy lands would welcome him with their arms wide open. In reality, Lin Yun had already circulated his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, but he disguised it a little as he fused his sword intent into his music dao.

So aside from Mei Zihua, who fought him, no one else could sense it. Even the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master couldn’t be sure about it because it was too shocking for someone to grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent while being at the Dragon Pulse Realm. No matter what, he could sense that Mei Zihua no longer had such a massive advantage in their fight once Lin Yun brought out his sword intent.

“Sword intent!” Mei Zihua looked at this scene without any expression, but his eyes squinted. Sitting back down, he said, “I’m surprised. Your martial dao cultivation is really terrifying.”

When Lin Yun blew the flute, he could sense his sword intent filling up his body. After fusing with mental energy, his melody was like an erupting volcano. The power of sword intent combined with music dao gave him a great shock.

Mei Zihua’s facial expression was indifferent. But shortly after, his expression became grave, and he said, “You’re really troublesome to deal with. But my words are still the same as before. Is this the best you can do? It’s still not enough!”

As a light flashed across his pupils, he played his zither, and the crimson Vermillion Mark on his forehead was activated. Everyone could sense that a terrifying temperature accompanied Mei Zihua’s music, and his soundwaves became flame rings that were spreading out.

It felt as though each soundwave contained the Vermillion Bird’s divine flames, and even space shattered in the path of the soundwaves. Those fragments were swiftly incinerated to ashes, creating a terrifying phenomenon on Dual Moon Lake.

The Vermillion Bird in the sky kept flapping its wings, and a terrifying fluctuation spread out to clash with the sword intent, sun, and moon.

“This is interesting!” Mei Zihua revealed a fanatic expression as he executed the Divine Snow Plum Touch. The crimson mark on his forehead became increasingly terrifying. As the flames gathered in the sky, crimson lightning flashed before rumbling thunder exploded, which made the surrounding temperature rise.

“Demon Suppression Vermillion Cauldron!” A deep, terrifying, and aloof voice came from Mei Zihua’s mouth. The massive Vermillion Bird ignited in flames under the gaze of the Vermillion Bird Constellation before it formed into a hundred-foot cauldron.

“Hahaha! Great!” Mei Zihua looked possessed at this moment, with his pupils shining brightly. As his ten fingers danced on the zither, his melody formed into runes engraved on the ancient cauldron.

“Lin Xiao, only one person has managed to force me to use this secret technique so far, and you’re the second!” Mei Zihua laughed, and he looked excited, his face flushing red. With another manic laughter, Mei Zihua strummed the zither even faster, “It’s not embarrassing at all if you lose to me!”

When his ten fingers danced on the zither, the ancient cauldron emitted a blazing aura and flew towards Lin Yun. As the cauldron approached, Lin Yun’s melody was like a sword that collided with the metallic cauldron, causing sparks to fly around.

Simultaneously, space started crumbling around Dual Moon Lake, with cracks swiftly spreading out. Anyone could tell that Mei Zihua had used his trump card, wanting to suppress Lin Yun.

As Lin Yun blew the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, he raised his head and looked at the massive, descending cauldron. He could sense an extreme danger coming from it.

Under the suppression of the crimson cauldron, the sun and moon he summoned froze as though they were sealed. Under the empowerment of the Sovereign Constellation, Lin Yun couldn’t even block it with his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

A sharp light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, and he circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. His dragon origin ocean rumbled, and an ancient demonic cauldron broke out from the sea. He was using the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to wield the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron at this moment.

When the cauldron appeared, boundless crimson radiance shone out and was released from his body through melody. As the demonic cauldron sensed the existence of the crimson cauldron, it released a furious roar, and Lin Yun could finally control the sun and moon with his flute melody once more.

The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron blocked the pressure coming from the crimson cauldron, and Lin Yun could play his melody normally once more. The sun and moon revolved before forming a cauldron, and his sword intent started to rise with his pupils blazing with fighting spirits.

His melody was like a sword, and the cauldron formed by the sun and moon clashed with the crimson cauldron under everyone’s shocked gazes. The sky rumbled when the two cauldrons clashed, and everyone could sense a horrifying aura sweeping out.

But it didn’t end there because Dual Moon Lake was distorted under the clash, and the lake was like a shattered mirror. This was a terrifying scenery, before a horrifying shockwave exploded. The faces of everyone by the lakeside changed, and they quickly soared to the sky.

“What a powerful collision!” A Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s elder said on the ship that had already flown to the sky. They were looking at the origin of the collision, and it was hard for them to imagine that two juniors had created it.

“Who won?” Everyone was nervous because they knew there would be an outcome from a collision of this scale.

“Profound Fairy…” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi were both nervous, and they couldn’t help turning to look at Yue Weiwei. They wanted to receive an answer from her. But Yue Weiwei’s brows were furrowed because she also couldn’t see the result of the collision under the violent aura.

Melodies were still fluctuating, and determining who won the fight was hard for her. As her eyes were glued to that region, she suddenly squinted her eyes when a dragon roar echoed from Dual Moon Lake. Shortly after, a sun and a moon flew out; however, they had become a lot dimmer than before.

“Who won the fight?”

“Did Lin Xiao win?” Everyone by the lakeside was nervous and wanted to know the outcome. Thus, the surroundings fell into a dead silence with only a breeze blowing by.

But the silence did not last long as a white-robed figure soared to the sky. Everyone looked at that figure and exclaimed, “It’s Lin Xiao!”

When fine rain drizzled down on the lake, everyone lowered their gazes to see Mei Zihua slowly appearing. His face was pale, with blood on the corner of his lips. Even all the strings on his zither had snapped. On the other hand, Lin Yun slowly approached Mei Zihua under his flute music.

“Young Master!” The nine maids exclaimed, and they quickly approached. The nine of them played their musical instruments, creating a majestic phenomenon that charged towards Lin Yun. This surprised Lin Yun, sending him flying by their sudden assault.

Lin Yun had just fought with Mei Zihua and was exhausted. So his melody was instantly disrupted when he suffered the attack from the nine maids. As the sun and moon dissipated in the sky, Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lip and said, “Mei Zihua, what do you mean by this? Trying to take advantage of numbers? You’re a descendant of the Mei Clan, one of the Ten Musical Clans.”

“Brother Lin, be more generous. Since you want the nine beauties, you naturally have to subdue them. Otherwise, you might have an issue with them in the future.” Mei Zihua smiled as he installed new strings on his zither.

His words naturally made Lin Yun’s face black, with the corner of his lips were twitching. But before he could say anything, Mei Zihua said, “Nirvana Rebirth!”

His zither melody overlapped with his nine maids, and various sacred auras swept out from them with flames igniting on the lake’s surface. While Lin Yun was shocked, a powerful aura swept out, and the Vermillion Bird underwent a rebirth.

The Vermillion Bird Constellation beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven also opened its eyes again. The table was turned around in the blink of an eye. Facing their attacks, Lin Yun could only leap on the lake, dodging the attacks from the Vermillion Bird and melody.

“Brother Lin, this won’t do.” Mei Zihua smiled.

Lin Yun wore a grave expression and loosened his grip on the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute. This shocked everyone and they wondered if Lin Yun would give up resisting. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just when everyone was feeling uncertain, Lin Yun waved his hand and summoned an ancient erhu. He held onto the erhu with one hand and the bow with another. Raising his brow, he said, “Mei Zihua, let’s have some fun since you want to play, then!”
