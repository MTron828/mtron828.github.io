Chapter 1153 - Radiant Snow Flower

Ye Ziling had high status in the sect, and no one would go against her orders. If given a choice, Feng Zhang and the rest of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect would die for her without any hesitation. After all, a swordsman wasn’t afraid of death.

To swordsmen, it was more painful for them to carry on living pitifully. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party didn’t hesitate after hearing Ye Ziling’s words. They weren’t cowards, but loyal members of the sect. They had no choice but to listen to the orders of their senior sister.

At this moment, Ye Ziling was disappearing from Lin Yun’s sight. However, he could still hear her words lingering in his ears. She decided to face the demonic cultivators on her own. Could it be that she was already prepared to give her life up if Lei Ying arrived?

Lin Yun realized why Ye Ziling gave him the origin stone. It forced him to listen to her orders rather than acting on his own. It was the first time he felt such pain in his chest ever since reaching the Kunlun Realm.

In just that brief moment, the disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect were already a few thousand meters away, and this left all the demonic cultivators stunned. After all, they didn’t expect a sect to act this way.

Lei Ying looked at Ye Ziling and his smile became sinister, “It has been a long time, Lady Ye. The rest of you chase after them and bring me back the origin stone at all cost!”

“Roger!” The demonic cultivators replied because none of them dared to disobey Lei Ying, especially after witnessing Qin Feng’s death.

“All of you can stay behind…” Ye Ziling said as Azure Birds flew out of her body. Unlike the past, the Azure Birds were enveloped in a purple luster that gave them unimaginable power.

When Ye Ziling moved, purple lightning began to flicker around her while flames blazed in the depths of her pupils. Then, bewitching flowers appeared with petals full of lightning.

When Lei Ying saw the purple flaming flower in Ye Ziling’s pupils, he exclaimed, “The Radiant Snow Flower!”

“You truly deserve to be a genius of the demonic path who came from Demon Domain. You’re pretty knowledgeable,” said Ye Ziling. As the flower bloomed in her pupils, the Azure Birds also began to flicker with lightning. At the same time, purple snow flowers descended from the sky.

All of the demonic cultivators who were about to chase after Lin Yun began to scream out in pain. The power of the ten Azure Birds were like ten sharp swords.

Even an Astral Stage expert like Xiao Kun had to take a few steps back from the phenomenon. The other demonic cultivators were heavily injured and some even lost their lives.

Meanwhile, Ye Ziling stood indifferently under the phenomenon.

“What powerful lightning intent… isn’t she a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?” Xiao Kun landed beside Lei Ying with blood dripping down on his lips. Fear filled his eyes as he examined the phenomenon that Ye Ziling created.

“Radiant Snow Bloodline, the Radiant Snow Sword Sutra!” Lei Ying wore a grave expression under his mask as he looked at Ye Ziling, “You’re really strange. You possess the noble bloodline of a saint clan, but you hole yourself up in a place like the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. The Radiant Snow Sword Sutra isn’t compatible with the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, causing many flaws. So you can’t stop me.”

“I have no intention of stopping you. I’m already prepared to die. If you’re prepared to face the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and a saint clan’s revenge, you can attack!” Ye Ziling said coldly.

“Hahaha!” Lei Ying suddenly laughed. “Others might be afraid of you if they heard that, but it’s a pity that you ran into me, Lei Ying! Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

Lei Ying charged forward with his terrifying cultivation in the quasi-Elysium Core Realm, causing heaven and earth to tremble violently. Facing one of the Azure Birds, Lei Ying snickered before he destroyed it with a punch.

When the Azure Bird was destroyed, Ye Ziling’s face became grave. So she took in a deep breath and drew her sword.

“Sun Concealing Clouds!” When her cold voice sounded out, the snow flowers in the surroundings became even colder. With her sky sword intent unleashed, she appeared in front of Lei Ying.

This woman…is really terrifying… Lei Ying muttered inwardly. He quickly countered with black demonic flames. Fusing his lightning and flame intent together, Lei Ying strengthened himself quickly.

He easily resolved Ye Ziling’s attack, but the snow flowers and nine other Azure Birds showed no signs of disappearing. Lei Ying locked his brow because he knew that it was impossible for him to destroy the phenomenon if their fight continued.

With the other demonic cultivators trapped in the phenomenon, it would be impossible for them to chase after the fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party. Thinking about it, Lei Ying’s face immediately became sinister.

A few people shuttled through the crimson stone forest. The entire party was silent as they felt a knot in their chest. Suddenly, Liu Qingyan came to a stop with his eyes reddened, “I don’t want to run anymore…”

Liu Yuan opened his mouth, but no words came out. After all, who would be running if it wasn’t for Ye Ziling’s orders? They knew that it was hopeless for Ye Ziling to face Lei Ying even if she was strong. After all, Lei Ying had killed two elders in the Elysium Core Realm.

Furthermore, Lei Ying even killed Qin Feng. None of them wanted to leave Ye Ziling with a monster like him. Even Wang Yuruo’s eyes were red as she sobbed. This was her first training experience out of the sect, and she wasn’t prepared for it to be so terrifying.

She didn’t want to lose Ye Ziling, but she didn’t even dare to face Lei Ying head-on. Thinking about it, more tears fell down from her cheeks because she felt that she was really useless.

As for Lin Yun, his heart was even heavier than the origin stone in his sword box.

Suddenly, Liu Qingyan thought of something and turned to look at Lin Yun, “Lin Yun, you’re also a heavenly core disciple, so you can choose not to listen to senior sister’s orders. We’ll follow you as long as you give the words!”

Liu Qingyan’s words instantly drew everyone’s attention. Everyone, including Liu Yuan, looked at Lin Yun with expectation. Lin Yun hesitated and stayed silent.

“You!” Liu Qingyan roared, “Lin Yun, are you a coward? It’s okay. If you don’t want to go, then I’ll go!”

“You’re going to go back to die?” Lin Yun wore a mocking smile and continued, “You might even hold her back. You’ll be killed and you might even drag her down with you!”

Liu Yuan’s emotion was low as he said, “Junior Brother Liu, Senior Brother Lin is right. It’s all thanks to senior sister that we’re still alive. If we go back right now, everything she did will be in vain. If we stay alive, senior sister might have a chance. But if we go back right now, she will die.”

His words hit everyone like a cold bucket of water.

“Senior Brother Yun, I don’t want anything to happen to senior sister,” said Wang Yuruo as tears continued to fall from her cheeks. In her heart, Lin Yun was a hero who broke the record and ascend the Sword Saint Mountain. So she believed that Lin Yun could do the impossible.

Liu Yuan opened his mouth to explain things to Wang Yuruo, but Lin Yun’s words suddenly sounded out, “You guys leave. Go to the campsite, it should be the safest place right now.”

“What about you?” Liu Yuan exclaimed.

“Junior Brother Liu is right. As a heavenly core disciple, there’s no need for me to listen to her orders,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Senior Brother Lin, I’m sorry about what I said earlier…” Liu Qingyan apologized after calming down.

“Disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect listen up!” Lin Yun became solemn as he uttered a command, “I, Lin Yun, as a heavenly core disciple, order you to leave immediately!”

Everyone was stumped. They never thought that Lin Yun would go back by himself. They were also shocked that he was relying on his status as a heavenly core disciple.

Liu Yuan turned to look at Lin Yun. When the two of them exchanged gazes, Liu Yuan instantly knew what Lin Yun wanted to do. After all, he could see the comforting confidence in Lin Yun’s eyes. When he recalled how Luo Kui died, Liu Yuan nodded his head. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Let’s go!” He then left with everyone. But even after they left, they were still looking in the direction Lin Yun was in.

When Lin Yun turned around, the Silver Moon Mask was already in his hand as he smiled and shook his head, “Oh Lin Yun, you’re only in the Profound Azure Prefecture for one year. Why are you still putting your life in danger…”

Then, Lin Yun put on the mask. After all, he was Flower Burial!
