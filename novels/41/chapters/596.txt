Chapter 597 - Slaying Zombies

When the six silver rays pinned the Green-eyed Zombie on the wall, the entire chamber began to tremble from the impact. This shocked Yang Fan and Guo Xu. Was this the power of the greater mastery xiantian sword intent?

They knew that sword intent was powerful, but they never expected it to be this powerful.

“Success?” Lin Yun was also surprised, but he didn’t dare to lower his guards.. For some reason, he didn’t think that the Green-eyed Zombies would be so easy to deal with.

Right at this moment the Green-eyed Zombies began to blaze with green flames and instantly broke free of the sword rays’ restraint. It spat out a green liquid from its mouth that instantly caused black smoke to rise from the ground.

“Be careful, that’s the corpse poison. It’s extremely troublesome to deal with if you get hit by it,” said Yang Fan as he whipped two Green-eyed Zombies to send them flying. But when his whip landed on the zombies, it had only caused sparks on the zombies’ bodies.

“How annoying!” Guo Xu finally roared out furiously as his body crackled with lightning and he began to throw out punches. Accompanied by the sound of explosions, his pucnhes constantly pushed the Green-eyed Zombies back.

In the blink of an eye, a myriad of punches were thrown out. His fists even left afterimages in the air, which was a sign that his fist was faster than the eye could see. After another huge explosion, the Green-eyed Zombies were slammed into the wall.

“Die!” Guo Xu’s eyes glowed coldly as lightning crackled on the surface of his body even more ferociously. When his aura rose to its limit, his left fist punched the zombie’s head, which sent it headfirst into the wall.

On the other hand, Lin Yun frowned his brows as he looked at the zombie regenerating from its wounds. It didn’t take long for the zombie to finish regenerating. The zombie was practically like an iron wall and when the cloth landed on the zombie, it only produced muffled sounds.

“How troublesome.” Yang Fan poured his origin energy into his whip, so the zombies weren’t able to get close to him. The moment they got close, they would be knocked away by his whip. Snorting, Yang Fan wrapped his whip around a zombie’s neck and flung it towards another zombie.

The zombies collided and flew far away. But it didn’t take long for them to get back up on their feet.

On the side, Guo Xu’s face was also covered with shock as he looked at the zombie he smashed into the wall slowly climbing out.

As for Lin Yun, the cloth in his hand released a dazzling brilliance as it slammed into the zombie like a ferocious beast. The zombie spat out pieces of its internal organs and was smashed into the wall again. Finally, the wall that the zombie kept hitting became rubble.

“This can’t keep going on. Their defences and regeneration speed is too terrifying. We either leave now or die of exhaustion. Yang Fan, think of a solution,” said Guo Xu. His punches were powerful, but there was nothing he could do if they couldn’t pierce through the zombie.

Looking at the zombie crawling out from the pile of rocks, Lin Yun frowned his eyebrows and hesitated if he should use the complete mastery xiantian sword intent to destroy the zombie. The zombie’s defense wasn’t just powerful, but it also had a strong regenerative ability. There was nothing Lin Yun could do about it if he couldn't kill it instantly.

But very quickly, Lin Yun made his decision. Yang Fan and Guo Xu were both on the ranking, so they naturally had their own trump cards. There was no need for him to reveal his. If he really couldn’t do anything to the zombies, then he could just leave. He was concerned that the two would gang up on him the moment he brought out his xiantian sword intent in complete mastery.

“We have to kill the zombies instantly. I’ll restrain the four zombies. Lin Yun, use your xantian sword intent to pierce through the zombies’ defences and then Guo Xu will deal the final blow,” said Yang Fan with annoyance in his eyes. The zombies were also giving him a headache.

“Fine with me,” replied Lin Yun.

“Fine with me too. But Yang Fan, can you really restrain all four of them?” Guo Xu asked with flickering eyes. The plan was good, but trying to restrain all four of the zombies wouldn’t be easy.

“Watch.” Yang Fan glared at Guo Xu and roared, “Demonic Whip—Snake Dance!”

Yang Fan began to release a terrifying aura in the pinnacle Yang stage and his hair started fluttering in the wind. The terrifying aura matched the Yin-Yang stage and enveloped the entire chamber. Before Lin Yun and Guo Xu could react, countless whips began to dance around Lin Yun like a golden viper.

Lin Yun and Guo Xu were shocked and executed their movement techniques to start dodging the whips.

“Yang Fan, what the hell are you doing?!” Guo Xu yelled, but a whip flew past him that startled him greatly.

As Lin Yun dodged the whips, he fell into deep thoughts and looked at the chamber. He was shocked to realize that Yang Fan was gathering all four Green-eyed Zombies towards the center of the chamber. In the blink of an eye, the zombies were trapped.

The afterimages of Yang Fan’s whip formed an invisible cage that bound the zombies together. Then, Yang Fan yelled, “Imprison!”

Countless afterimages of whips overlapped to bind the four zombies together like a rope. But while the zombies roared and struggled, Yang Fan revealed a strained expression. But before Yang Fan could say anything, Lin Yun soared into the sky and split into nine afterimages.

When the nine afterimages overlapped together, moonlight began to shine on Lin Yun’s body as he stabbed out with the cloth in his hand. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

All four zombies had a huge wound on their chests, which made them even more frantic. They struggled violently when they felt the pain. However, before they could break free, a bolt of lightning landed on their chests. “Thunderbolt—Shattering Star!”

The four zombies instantly exploded as they were torn into fragments by Guo Xu’s attack.

“Success!” Guo Xu smiled as he dropped to one knee. Yang Fan also let out a breath of relief. It wasn’t easy controlling the zombies, so if Guo Xu wasn’t fast enough, the zombies would have broken free and his efforts would be for nothing.

But right at this moment, the heads of the zombies began to wiggle as new flesh was regenerating below their necks.

“Damn it!” Guo Xu and Yang Fan’s faces changed because they never expected the regenerative ability of the zombies to be so shocking. After all, the four zombies were only left with their heads.

But right at this moment, a sword ray flashed. The sword ray was so fast that Guo Xu and Yang Fan were shocked.

Thunderbolt Slasher!

When the sword ray dissipated, the cloth in Lin Yun’s hand had pierced into the four zombies’ heads.

“Break!” Lin Yun roared with a sharp flash in his eyes. Then, the four heads exploded at the same time.

“This…” Yang Fan and Guo Xu were both shocked as they looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. It took them a long time to recover and they could see the shock in each other's eyes.

With that, the zombies were finally dead. Storing his whip, Yang Fan stepped forward and gently tapped the platform up ahead.

A stone box slowly appeared out from the platform, which Yang Fan carefully opened to reveal three jade slips. The jade slips naturally recorded ancient martial techniques. It turned out that Yang Fan wasn’t wrong that this was a Martial Technique Chamber. The three jade slips represented a movement technique, a fist technique, and a cultivation technique.

“I want this,” said Lin Yun as he took the jade slip that recorded a movement technique.

“I’ll go for the fist technique,” said Guo Xu as he took a jade slip from the box.

As for Yang Fan, he wasn’t left with a choice, but he definitely got the one with the highest value. Even if the ancient cultivation technique couldn’t be compared to Lin Yun’s Iris Sword Sutra, it was still a lot stronger than many present day cultivation techniques.

Then again, neither Lin Yun nor Guo Xu suffered a loss as they both picked the martial technique most suitable to them. Furthermore, Yang Fan was the one who restrained the four zombies. Plus, he was also the one who led them here. So it was natural to let him have the cultivation technique.

“Farewell,” said Lin Yun as he turned to leave.

Before the two could speak, Lin Yun was already at the entrance. But right at this moment, Yang Fan suddenly called out, “Lin Yun, wait.”

Guo Xu had also collected himself at this moment and he looked at Lin Yu’s silhouette. Right at this moment, the stone chamber was enveloped in a peculiar atmosphere. Just a moment ago, the three had worked together to slay their enemies, but now, Yang Fan and Guo Xu’s gazes were both on Lin Yun with killing intent flashing in the depths of their eyes.

Lin Yun came to a stop. He was only one step away from leaving the chamber, but he chose to come to a stop. He could also choose to face the two with his back to ensure that he could escape immediately if anything went wrong. But Lin Yun knew that he didn’t have a choice.
