Chapter 550 - Breaking through the Cocoon

The fan didn’t interrupt Lin Yun, so his face turned pale. He had reached the critical moment of opening his profound palace. Blood was oozing out from the corner of his eyes and nose, which made him look pathetic. However, his black pupils were flashing with determination.

His boundless mental energy was compressed to the limit and a buzzing noise appeared in his mind as his body began to tremble violently. He couldn’t allow himself to fail right now.

“Form!” barked Lin Yun as his lips turned purple. At the same time, his mental energy fluctuation caused the entire courtyard to tremble.

“How is this fellow’s mental energy so powerful…” Mo Ling’s face changed as the commotion created by Lin Yun was even greater than when she became a third grade spiritualist. This meant that Lin Yun was at the same level as her.

Mo Ling had spent all her time on spiritual runes, which was why her attainments in spiritual runes got so strong. This was a foundation that she built from a young age. So one could imagine the shock Mo Ling was feeling when she saw the phenomenon created by Lin Yun.

As Lin Yun’s mental energy fluctuation became even more violent, the white of his eyes turned red. His pupils, however, were bright as he continued moving his brush. When he made the last stroke of the brush, the mental energy vortex was compressed to its limit and exploded into fragments before gathering back to form a palace.

This is the profound palace? Lin Yun looked at the palace doubtfully.

“Did you succeed?” asked Mo Ling.

“I think it was a success, but I don’t see the soul mark you said I would,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Hmmm? Let me take a look at it.” Mo Ling pointed her finger at Lin Yun’s mind and she closed her eyes. When she saw the palace, she smiled, “You’ve succeeded. But your mental energy is too vast, so there’s no way it can form a soul mark right now. However, the soul mark will gradually form once you become familiar with your profound palace.”

Mo Ling’s reply made Lin Yun feel relieved. He was glad that he hadn’t made any mistakes. When he raised his head to look at the painting stained with blood, the Firefeather Rune was vivid and the power it contained was boundless. It was like a feather that could pierce through the horizon.

“Congratulations. You’re essentially a third grade spiritualist and there’s nothing more I can teach you,” said Mo Ling as she took several steps back. Lin Yun was someone that she personally taught and the shock she suffered from Lin Yun’s rapid progress was unimaginable. Now that Lin Yun had become a third grade spiritualist, there was nothing else she could teach him.

“It’s coming to an end?” Lin Yun felt weird. He couldn’t get used to not being taught by Mo Ling every day.

“What else is there?” asked Mo Ling.

“But you haven’t taught me the complete Ablaze Phoenix Painting,” said Lin Yun.

“There’s no way it can trouble you now that you can use the Firefeather Rune to open your profound palace. However, third grade spiritual diagrams are too troublesome. We generally draw them on a painting before using them in battle,” smiled Mo Ling.

Lin Yun nodded his head. It would take him two hours to draw the Ablaze Phoenix Painting without the Firefeather Runes, which was impractical for him to do in battle. This meant that he could only prepare it beforehand and use it in battles.

“You seem to be lacking a spiritual artifact, but your sword box looks like one,” said Mo Ling as she looked at Lin Yun’s sword box.

This made Lin Yun’s heart tremble because Mo Ling’s gaze was sharp. However, Mo Ling’s gaze didn’t stay on the sword box for long before she continued, “But there’s nothing I can do even if it’s not. I’ll see if there’s an opportunity to prepare one for you next time.”

Seeing that Mo Ling was about to leave, Lin Yun asked, “You still have not told me what you need my help for.”

“Let Elder Tang tell you about it. The academy needs your help and you can reply based on your heart. Furthermore, it still hasn’t been confirmed.” Mo Ling then looked at Lin Yun and continued, “Clean yourself up. You look like a wreck.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Then, Mo Ling left.

Based on my heart? Lin Yun smiled bitterly, “How can I possibly refuse?”

Lin Yun didn’t like owing anyone favors. So he could only wait now. As long as it was something within his power, then he would definitely not refuse it. But if something happened in between and he wasn’t needed, he also wouldn’t force it. He was very curious about what the academy needed from him. Especially since they had Mo Ling personally teach him spiritual runes for half a month.

Within the cultivation room, Lin Yun sat in the Spiritual Convergence Array with spiritual energy fluctuating around him. Within his dantian, the Iris Flower was absorbing all the spiritual energy.

It had been five days since he opened up his profound palace. He had spent his time in the cultivation room digesting the Profound Yin Flower that lingered in his body. He was also trying to find an opportunity to form the soul mark.

However, there were no changes to the soul energy fragments lying in his profound palace. But all of a sudden, the origin energy in his violet palace fluctuated and started to expand at a visible speed. At the same time, he could feel a swelling sensation all over his body.

This is… Lin Yun instantly rejoiced because this was a sign that he was going to make a breakthrough. He had been stuck in the pinnacle greater Yin stage ever since he refined the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower. He was disappointed that he didn’t make a breakthrough. After all, he worked hard to obtain the flower king that only appears once a decade.

Suppressing his joy, Lin Yun calmed himself down and circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, making the Iris Flower bloom. As he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, the surrounding spiritual energy began to pour into his body, forming a lake of origin energy in his violet palace. At the same time, Lin Yun became shrouded in a silver glow.

It’s finally starting! Lin Yun proceeded to use the sword array to absorb the surrounding spiritual energy and to refine the remaining Profound Yin Flower’s energy in his body as he attacked his bottleneck.

Suddenly, a silver wave swept in his violet palace as the bottleneck broke. In the next second, a horrifying power began to fill Lin Yun’s body and his aura began to grow.

When Lin Yun sensed his violet palace expanding by 50%, he smiled because he had finally reached the pinnacle Yin stage. This meant that he could finally be considered an expert with the capital to compete with the geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

After all, everyone on the Dragoncloud Ranking was at least in the greater Yin stage. He was still tender in his cultivation, but everything had a beginning. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his pupils shined so brightly that they glimmered.

But just when Lin Yun was about to get back on his feet, a buzzing noise came from the profound palace in his mind. His joy filled his face the moment this happened. Lin Yun knew that the soul mark was finally taking form. It was more good news.

The fragments in his profound palace began to buzz as they started to gather into a finger-sized mark. This mark looked similar to the Firefeather Rune, which gave Lin Yun a profound feeling. But at the same time, it was also different from the Firefeather Rune because the rune emitted a faint purple glow.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he could clearly sense every detail in the room. As Lin Yun closed his eyes, the soul mark in his profound palace became dim and everything finally went back to normal.

“Is this the usage of soul energy?” Lin Yun flicked his finger and a Firefeather Rune appeared and hovered in the air. It felt like one of his arms because he could control it freely.

At this moment, he finally understood why the third grade spiritualist was just the beginning level. With a smile on his lips, Lin Yun dismissed the Firefeather Rune.

“Young lad, come with me if you’re free. Senior Tang wishes to see you.” A voice rang out from outside Lin Yun’s courtyard that came from Yu Mu.

Lin Yun had been waiting for a while and the time had finally come. He really wanted to know what the academy needed of him. So without any hesitation, he opened the door and went out.
