Not long later, countless bolts of lightning descended from the sky, which created huge waves on the ocean of blood. Then, the huge wave swept towards Lin Yun.

“What speed!” Lin Yun was shocked by the speed because it had reached him in a few breaths. The wave was high and he could tell that it was strong. When he turned around, he found that there was no path of retreat aside from charging forward.

Just when Lin Yun was accumulating his strength preparing to throw a punch, the lightning reached him like venomous pythons and took a bite. This made Lin Yun suck in air from the pain, as the lightning spread throughout his body.

Lin Yun immediately circulated the Azure Dragon Enneaform as the dragon runes enveloped his body and started to glow purple. After circulating the Azure Dragon Enneaform at full force, the pain finally became lighter. However, Lin Yun could still feel his muscles twitching and meridians trembling lightly.

“How troublesome!” Lin Yun was annoyed because he could only bring out 70% of his strength in his current state. So it wouldn’t be easy for him to destroy the wave relying on origin energy, not to mention the lightning energy contained in the wave.

With a decisive light flashing through his pupils, Lin Yun brought out the Azure Dragon Sword Aura. When he threw his punch, an azure dragon flew out like a sharp sword and streaked across space.

His punch created a huge tunnel through the black wave, which he charged through. But the moment he landed on the surface of the ocean, the terrifying lightning on the ocean quickly spread throughout his body once again.

“How troublesome…” Lin Yun’s lips twitched because the lightning on the ocean of blood would probably exist for a long time. If he only relied on his origin energy, there was no way he could get past the test. So he ultimately had to rely on his physique. He also now knew why there was a threshold in the beginning to test his physique. However, his Azure Dragon Battle Physique only fulfilled the lowest requirement.

“I can comprehend the sky sword intent, so I refuse to believe that I can’t get through this test!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with stubbornness as he resisted the lightning. As his vitality began to boil, he gave off an aura of an ancient beast.

Every time his footstep landed, it would cause a loud muffled sound and a huge wave. In just an hour, Lin Yun’s forehead was covered with cold sweat and his face paled because his entire body was stinging in pain.

Furthermore, if he wasn’t careful, the waves would occasionally try to pull him into the ocean. The ocean was formed with blood from ten thousand different demonic beasts, so it would be dangerous if he fell into the baleful aura. As lightning continued to descend, Lin Yun traveled through the black ocean.

Three days later, dozens of lightning bolts roared as they created a huge wave that collided with Lin Yun. The pain made Lin Yun’s face distort. However, he had gradually adapted to the environment over the past three days. If he could resist with his physique, he wouldn’t exhaust his origin energy.

In addition to the pain from the lightning, there was also the corrosive pain from the ocean that made Lin Yun feel like he was getting stabbed by needles. WIth a long sigh, Lin Yun straightened himself and continued forward. He was trying his best to temper his physique with the lightning.

Although the effects were weak, his physique had become stronger by at least 50% over the past three days. Even if he couldn’t pass the test, the strengthening of his physique was well worth the effort.

Suddenly, lightning descended from the sky, which allowed Lin Yun to see a black pillar in his horizon. He was caught off guard because it was a tornado.

The tornado had swept up a pillar of water and flickered with lightning. It was so strong that it left black cracks in the surrounding space. As he watched more black pillars form, Lin Yun knew that he would get heavily injured if he touched them.

With a grave face, Lin Yun executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations to charge forward. Pushing his speed to the limit, he flew like a golden crow. But even so, it wasn’t easy for him.

Like a bird, Lin Yun shuttled through the tornadoes. When he landed on the surface of the ocean, he let out a sigh of relief. Raising his head, he discovered that he was a little closer to the flames.

“I should reach the flames in about half a month.” Lin Yun analyzed. All of a sudden, Lin Yun discovered a suction force coming from the black ocean. The spinning of the tornadoes had created a vortex in the ocean.

“Damn it!” Lin Yun cursed and tried to flee, but the suction force was too strong to resist. It felt like a huge hand was dragging him into the vortex.

His entire world spun as he was dragged into the ocean. Under the boundless force in the ocean, Lin Yun was having difficulty resisting.

There was naturally no way he could resist the force as he was slowly torn apart. At the same time, black blood seeped into his body and started incinerating his origin energy. All of this happened in the blink of an eye, so Lin Yun couldn’t react in time. When he recovered from his shock, he was already a thousand meters in the ocean with a third of his body gone.

“Am I going to die?” For the first time, Lin Yun forgot about the pain as fear loomed in his heart. He knew that the dragon spirit could save him if he chose to give up. But that would mean that his opportunity would be revoked. At the same time, he also wouldn’t be able to obtain the body-refining technique, not to mention the opportunity above fortune.

His physique continued to fall deeper into the ocean as he pondered his situation. At the same time, the black blood continued to burn his internal organs and meridians. It was a pain beyond words.

Damn it! Lin Yun refused to yell so he could maintain his qualification. He knew that this was only a test, which meant that there was a way he could survive. When he calmed himself down, he heard some faint voices that beat like the drums. Instantly, he realized that the drums were the beating of the azure dragon’s heart.

When the last part of his muscles and bones were shredded into pieces, Lin Yun finally heard the azure dragon’s heart beating with his heartbeat. As time passed, lights slowly emitted out of his tattered body as the impurities within his body were being cleansed. Meanwhile, the remaining essence surged towards his heart.

Simultaneously, several figures appeared on the plaza with faces full of fear. These people were the ones that had quickly given up on their tests. Unfortunately for them, their qualification was revoked.
