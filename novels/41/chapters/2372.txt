Chapter 2373 - Fearless Flower Burial

“Big Brother Lin!” Lin Jiangxian and Ji Zixi’s faces were pale when they approached Lin Yun. One had forcibly used the Five Elements Dao, while the other pushed her bloodline to the limit using the Divine Phoenix Fire. But thanks to that, they managed to stop the other geniuses from approaching.

“Are you two alright?” Lin Yun asked, looking at Ji Zixi.

“Hehe, I’m fine. Big Brother, can we go now?” Ji Zixi chuckled. There was a sickly blush to her pale face, and her condition wasn’t as good as she said.

“Let’s erase the lingering soul first,” Lin Yun said, looking at the golden spirit core in his hand. The lingering soul was the Blood Conceal King’s saint soul, but that wasn’t a problem since most of his saint soul was destroyed. The one left in the golden spirit core was only a tiny part. With his Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent, he could easily erase that soul.

“We can’t go over...” Qin Yun’s face was ugly. If they tried to forcibly charge through the fire, it would be troublesome if they were caught in the flames.

People like Heavenly Book still hadn’t completely recovered and was bearing pain from his internal organs being burned by the Divine Phoenix Fire.

Tuoba Hong frowned, “That’s the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden. She must have used her blood essence to forcibly push her Phoenix Sacred Flame into changing to Divine Phoenix Fire.”

Everyone’s faces were ugly because they knew what this meant, and they could only look at Lin Yun with envy.

“What’s so good about him?!” Jiang Ziyao gritted. He still couldn’t believe that Lin Jiangxian attacked him. Back in the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s headquarters, they still had a pretty good relationship together, and he thought that he could win her heart with enough time.

No one spoke out, but their faces were also ugly.

“They’re leaving!” Mu Qianxue said as Lin Yun’s group crushed the medal and left.

““Damn it!”” Everyone cursed. After all, they had planned everything, but everything went down the drain and could only watch as Lin Yun left with the golden spirit core. In the end, they became the clowns instead.

The gazes of the four geniuses turned to look at Jiang Ziyao and Heavenly Book.

Jiang Ziyao coldly said, “This isn’t over!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Everyone thought about trump cards they didn’t use while Lin Yun returned to Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain with the golden spirit core.

“Flower Burial has returned!” Cheers echoed when they saw Lin Yun’s figure. Lin Yun had become a famous figure as everyone witnessed what he did in the Nether Woods Mountain Range. Who could’ve thought the six geniuses were playing around in Lin Yun’s palm?

“Hahaha! That was satisfying!”

“It’s good that Lin Yun won!”

“He has long discovered that the ancient battlefield was unusual and was forced to retaliate.” Everyone was excited, especially swordsmen. After all, everyone watched what the six geniuses did.

“Lin Yun!” Ao Jue and Xiong Tiannan excitedly came over.

“Hahaha! You guys didn’t see how ugly the six of their faces were!” Xiong Tiannan said in excitement.

“Oh?” Lin Yun was surprised as he raised his head and saw the screen. On the screen, the six geniuses were trying to break through the encirclement of the demonic corpses and crush their medals to return. When his gaze fell onto Profound Sky Venerable, he instantly knew what was happening.

“How many spirit cores do we have now?” Lin Yun asked.

“Adding up those on Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue, we have about four hundred,” Lin Jiangxian said.

“Okay. Since that’s the case, I want to let Zixi have the golden spirit core. Lady Lin, what do you think?” Lin Yun asked. After all, the golden spirit core was a direct ticket to the Heavenly Barren Banquet. According to Profound Sky Venerable, Ji Zixi was the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, and the ancestral deity would take her as his disciple. This meant that he would be able to fulfil his promise with the Divine Phoenix Holy Master.

Lin Jiangxian smiled, “I have no opinion about it. WIthout your help, I’m afraid I couldn’t even come to Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain.

“You’re being too humble,” Lin Yun smiled as he handed the golden spirit core to Ji Zixi.

Ji Zixi’s eyes were red, and she was touched. She muttered, “Big Brother Lin, I have received too much help from you.”

They first met in the Unholy Sea, where Lin Yun helped her make a breakthrough with the Phoenix Heart Song. Then, Lin Yun gave her the divine flame fragment in the Heavenly Void. Now, Lin Yun even gave her the golden spirit core.

“I will do what I’ve promised,” Lin Yun smiled. When Ji Zixi obtained the golden spirit core, he split the four hundred spirit cores with Ao Jue and Xiong Tiannan, allowing them to participate in the Heavenly Barren Banquet.

“Someone like you should stay in the three thousand realms...” Ao Jue said. “I have visited many places, but I’ve never seen someone like you.”

“What are you going to do now? Go after them?” Xiong Tiannan asked. He knew Lin Yun’s character well, and he was a good friend. But he also knew Lin Yun wouldn’t let what happened in the Nether Woods Mountain Range go.

“That’s for sure,” Lin Yun smiled with murderous intent rising in his eyes. “Let’s go.”

He led the way to Profound Sky Venerable and stated why he came.

“You want to give the golden spirit core to Ji Zixi?” Profound Sky Venerable was surprised. The golden spirit core represented a ticket to the Heavenly Barren Banquet, and it was naturally precious.

“Since I brought her here, I naturally have to send her up. The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s lineage in the Kunlun Realm helped the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity back then, so I have returned the favor to them,” Lin Yun said. The Divine Phoenix Mountain Clan stayed in the Kunlun Realm for the ancient battle, but they were also trapped in the Kunlun Realm because of that, Ji Zixi bore the responsibility for bringing them back.

“But this isn’t over yet. The competition for the remaining nine quotas will continue, and you’ve greatly offended them. I’m worried about your quota,” Profound Sky Venerable said with a grave expression.

Ji Zixi asked, “I don’t want it, then. Big Brother Lin can take it.”

She was worried about Lin Yun, and she didn’t want to see him in danger again.

“What nonsense are you talking about?” Lin Yun caressed Ji Zixi’s head, and smiled, “This was my intention from the beginning. So you’re not allowed to refuse.”

Ji Zixi gritted her teeth but gradually calmed down. Seeing the gentle expression and confident look on Lin Yun’s face, she could feel her heart melting. She felt blissful and uneasy while looking at Lin Yun’s face. At this moment, she just wanted to stay together with Lin Yun.

“Alright. I’ll hold onto the golden spirit core for now, and congratulations to you,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled, showing his fondness for Ji Zixi. He was naturally happy that she could participate in the Heavenly Barren Banquet. He then turned to Lin Yun, and said, “You have to be careful.”

Lin Yun merely replied with a wink. He smiled, “Since we’re so acquainted, why don’t you tell me how we will determine the remaining nine quotas?”

“It will be brutal,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

“Oh, okay.” Lin Yun didn't ask anything else about it. He swept his gaze over the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, and walked over. When he touched the cauldron, he circulated the Blue Dragon Divine Seal, wanting to see if it would work. He tried to change the topic, and asked, “Speaking of which, what’s the effect of the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet?”

“The Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet is used to temper the physique. You possess the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, but you haven’t fully excavated its potential. You also have to undergo tribulations. With the help of the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet, it will help you far more than you can imagine...” Profound Sky Venerable said.

Right then, the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron lightly trembled, and Lin Yun knew that the method given to him by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity worked. He inwardly rejoiced, before quickly letting go of the cauldron, seeing that Profound Sky Venerable’s gaze was directed over.

“What are you doing?” Profound Sky Venerable looked at the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron before turning to Lin Yun. He then said, “Don’t even think about it. This is the treasure of Heaven’s Gate, a gift from the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity to the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity.”

Lin Yun said, “I do want it, but I don’t have the ability to take it. I only patted on it earlier.”

Profound Sky Venerable snorted, then smiled, “At least you’re tactful. You won’t be able to bring the cauldron away no matter what you do. Hahaha, have fun touching it.”

Lin Yun merely smiled and said nothing. He wasn’t anxious. He wanted to wait till everyone settled down. He was determined to take the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron with him before leaving, and even the ancestral deity couldn't stop him.

Right then, the six geniuses returned, looking at Lin Yun with murderous intent, while Lin Yun looked at them with a fearless smile.
