Chapter 1841 - Sovereign Destiny

Yu Wenxiu fell to the ground and threw out a mouthful of blood. As his face became terrifyingly pale, the other Ming Cult’s disciples quickly came forth to help him.

“Get lost! I don’t need anyone’s help!” Yu Wenxiu furiously shoved everyone away, and he no longer had his confidence from before. When the other holy land geniuses saw this scene, they were feeling lucky.

Although they were willing to see Lin Yun’s death, they had no intentions of becoming his enemy. They could only say that Yu Wenxiu was finished.

“Let’s go for the other treasures.” They swiftly made up their minds and headed for the other pillars. There were a lot of treasures here, so they could still obtain some valuable treasures, even if they couldn’t obtain a Glory Saint Artifact. Based on their strength, they were more than capable of going for the other treasures as long as they didn’t compete with Lin Yun.

Lin Yun looked at the silver fan enveloped in the lightning. This fan looked extraordinary, looking ancient and beautiful. It looked like a piece of art.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s pretty beautiful.” Lin Yun smiled. Without mentioning the power of this Glory Saint Artifact, just the appearance alone was attractive.

“But the restrictions are a little troublesome.” An Liuyan said.

“Do you like it?”

“Of course, I do.” An Liuyan smiled.

“I’ll take it for you.” Lin Yun said, and he repeated what he did with the beads, using brute force to shatter the lightning.

When everything calmed down, An Liuyan was shocked while looking at Lin Yun. This all felt like a dream to her. She sneaked a peek at Lin Yun, and her face flushed. Lin Yun looked really beautiful, and her heart throbbed rapidly.

Taking a step forward, Lin Yun was shocked when he held onto this fan. This fan was actually two fans overlapping together. When he opened it up, there was a fire phoenix and blue luan bird engraved on the fans. This was a Paragon Phoenix Fan.

“Liuyan, you’re really lucky. This is a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact.” Lin Yun smiled as he retrieved the fan.

“What?!” An Liuyan was stumped. She was taken aback when she received the fan from Lin Yun. This all felt like a dream to her. “Thank you, Young Master.”

When Lin Yun raised his head, the competition over another Glory Saint Artifact had reached its peak. The Fire God General was fighting with the man wearing a bamboo hat. The Fire God General should hold the advantage. But because he didn’t rest after being injured several times and didn’t have time to rest, the man with a bamboo hat held the upper hand, relying on the Golden Dragon Clan’s body-refining technique to clash with the Glory Saint Artifact head-on.

Is that fellow trying to become a saint through his physique? Lin Yun inwardly thought, but he didn’t go over to join the fun. After taking another four to five treasures, Lin Yun staggered and An Liuyan quickly held onto him.

“Let’s go. It’s time to leave.” Lin Yun said.

An Liuyan was obedient and leaped from the stone pillar with Lin Yun. When they landed on the ground, Lin Yun and An Liuyan flew towards Gu Jun. Lin Yun asked, “Are you alright?”

The old man had a drop of heart blood forcibly taken away, and he was weakly sitting on the ground. There was nothing Lin Yun could do to help. His Blue Dragon Bone could help treat injuries, but it couldn’t do anything about the heart’s blood.

“I won’t be dying anytime soon.” Gu Jun opened his eyes.

“Lead the way.” Lin Yun nodded.

Gu Jun was briefly stunned before he glared at Lin Yun, “You actually remembered.”

Lin Yun was asking him to lead the way to the Demigod Wine Cellar, and Gu Jun was surprised about it. He thought that Lin Yun had already forgotten about it after so many things happened.

“Hehe, wait for me.” Mei Zihua chased after them. He had been secretly paying attention to Lin Yun. He didn’t dare to waste too much time competing for treasures, fearing that Lin Yun might leave without him. The result was just as he had expected, Lin Yun didn’t even bother calling him.

Just when Lin Yun’s party was about to leave, Yu Wenxiu suddenly opened his eyes, treating his injuries beneath the stone pillar with a murderous aura filling his pupils. As he roared, his voice echoed throughout the entire hall, “Nirvana Banquet’s champion Lin Xiao, you’re barely holding on, right? And you’re still trying to leave so blatantly!”

As a matter of fact, many people discovered that Lin Yun was leaving, but no one dared to stop him. But they stopped when they heard what Yu Wenxiu said. After all, what Yu Wenxiu said was a possibility because Lin Yun didn’t refine the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, and he should be reaching his limit after so long.

Otherwise, he was capable of sweeping through everyone with his strength, so why didn’t he snatch all the treasures away? Since Lin Yun didn’t choose to do that, this made everyone find it strange.

“Ha. You think you can hide it from me?” Yu Wenxiu said coldly as he stood up.

Lin Yun’s face was dark, and he looked at Yu Wenxiu, “You’re starting to get on my nerves. I have gone easy on you multiple times, but do you really think I don’t dare to kill you?”

“Heh. Talk about that if you can protect yourself!” Yu Wenxiu sneered, and he immediately charged over. He couldn’t be bothered to waste time on nonsense with Lin Yun.

Once he appeared before Lin Yun, he unleashed ten-odd moves in the blink of an eye that were directed at Lin Yun’s vitals. Lin Yun didn’t make a move, but executed the Divine Sunchasing Art.

As fluctuations spread out in the surrounding space, Lin Yun began to move and multiple afterimages appeared where he stood. No matter how Yu Wenxiu attacked, he couldn’t even touch Lin Yun’s clothes.

“That’s enough!” Lin Yun snorted. He suddenly made a move as all his afterimages overlapped. As the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown shone brightly, he held onto Yu Wenxiu’s wrist, which left the latter stunned. Yu Wenxiu couldn’t believe that Lin Yun could still use the crown. This made no sense.

As Lin Yun’s thoughts rapidly process, he gently twisted Yu Wenxiu’s wrist, causing the latter to let out a miserable scream before his entire arm was ripped off by Lin Yun. Lin Yun had shown no mercy to him before his right hand manifested into a dragon’s claw, and he threw out a punch.

His punch created a hole in Yu Wenxiu’s chest, and the latter flew out like a ragdoll before colliding with the stone pillar. But he wasn’t that fortunate this time and collapsed to the ground, dying a terrible death.

“Lin You, you devil!” The Ming Cult’s disciples surrounded Yu Wenxiu’s corpse. They were furious, but none of them dared to take a step forth.

“As expected of the Nirvana Banquet’s champion. Let me come face you!” The man wearing a bamboo hat who was fighting the Fire God General suddenly descended from the sky and appeared before Lin Yun.

“You’re pretty bold with the guts to come over!” Lin Yun sneered.

“Why not? Even if you’re that person, I’d still dare to fight you!” The man wearing a bamboo hat said coldly, and he stepped forth to clash with Lin Yun head-on. He had his own judgment, and he believed that Lin Yun must be facing some troubles or he wouldn’t leave so early.

The Fire God General’s face changed while remaining on the stone pillar, glaring at Lin Yun as if he wanted to kill him with his gaze alone. He would’ve charged forth as well in the past, but he became cautious after suffering so many times in Lin Yun’s hands. Even if he was second only to Lin Yun, he still didn’t dare to act rashly.

Ten moves later, the golden body of Lin Yun’s opponent shattered like a saint artifact. His opponent took several steps back, with his cloak and bamboo hat destroyed, revealing a familiar face. He was Qin Cang, who was defeated by Lin Yun and had his dragon bone dug out at Profound Wither Island.

“It’s him?!”

“He’s Qin Cang, Tian Xuanzi’s disciple and formerly first on the Empyrean Ranking!”

“I thought he was dead after he lost to Flower Burial. After all, there wasn’t any news about him.” Many people recognized Qin Cang, and they were shocked to see him. But Qin Cang’s face was pale when he heard the surrounding discussions, especially when he heard Flower Burial’s name. So it turned out everyone already knew about it, and he clenched his fist before hammering the ground in a grievance.

“Hahaha! Lin Xiao, do you still have the strength to even put up a fight?” The Fire God General laughed from the stone pillar. He planned to probe Lin Yun and dashed over. But before he could even get close, nine chains flew out and sent him flying away, causing him to throw out a mouthful of blood.

Lin Yun shook his wrist and the nine chains were like pitch-black, venomous snakes. The nine chains combined into one and flew out like a dragon. His attack created a hole in the Fire God General’s Nethermoon Saint Armor before pinning him to the stone pillar,  terrifying everyone.

Three experts stood out, but Yu Wenxiu died, Qin Cang’s Dragon Clan body-refining technique was broken, and the Fire God General was greatly humiliated. He had probably never suffered such a huge loss in his life. He waved his hand and the chain separated into nine before coiling around his wrist.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun swept his gaze out, and he left after a cold snort. Everyone merely looked at Lin Yun but they didn’t dare to act rashly. With that, Lin Yun intimidated everyone in the hall by himself. But when Lin Yun’s group flew out and descended from the high platform, Lin Yun immediately fell to one knee.

Seeing Lin Yun throw out a mouthful of blood, An Liuyan was completely terrified and said, “Young Master, are you alright?”

“I’m fine. I’m already used to it.” Lin Yun had blood dripping down from the corner of his lips, and his face was pale. But he couldn’t get up after trying several times. This could be considered the consequence of using the Sovereign Saint Artifact. He didn’t use it rashly without refining it, but he still had to pay some price, no matter what.

The Golden-Purple Dragon Crown was too heavy, and Lin Yun couldn’t even remove it, even if he wanted to. It wasn’t heavy physically, but this crown contained a certain destiny. It was the sovereign destiny belonging to the royal lineage of the Golden-Purple Dragon Clan. Although it had acknowledged Lin Yun, he had yet to refine it. So this meant he would have to bear the destiny by wearing it on his head.

This was the reason why Lin Yun suddenly wanted to leave. If Yu Wenxiu hadn’t stopped him, he would at least have no problem removing it. So Yu Wenxiu naturally deserved to die.

“We have to help him remove the crown or he’ll be crushed to death.” Gu Jun held onto his chin while looking at the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, but he was cautious and didn’t dare to get close.

“Let me do it.” Mei Zihua smiled, taking a step forth, wanting to help Lin Yun remove the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.

“Don’t…” The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched, but it was already too late. When Mei Zihua came in contact with the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, he was sent flying back and threw out a mouthful of blood. A long time later, a groan resounded, so he probably slammed into a wall somewhere.
