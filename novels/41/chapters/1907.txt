Chapter 1908 - Tasteless Wine (2)

The grey-clothed youth stopped him and said, “I’m Chen Zhong of the Nether Orchid Courtyard. I have a question for you, and I’ll leave after asking it.”

“The Indigo Thunder Peak’s Ye Qingtian,” Lin Yun replied.

“Is… Is that how you always make a breakthrough?” Chen Zhong asked after a brief hesitation.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun’s face became black, and he left. But they were walking forward and couldn’t shake off each other because they were both going in the same direction.

“Can you stay away from me?” Chen Zhong asked unhappily.

“You can follow behind me,” Lin Yun said without any expression on his face.

Follow behind you? To smell your fart? Chen Zhong immediately shut his mouth, and they both began to compete with each other. He was practically confident that Ye Qingtian couldn’t make it through the second level with his cultivation.

In the end, Lin Yun made it through the trials at the same time as him. When they reached the summit, Lin Yun finally digested all the Heavenly Cloud Fruits, and his cultivation reached the pinnacle fourth channel of the Profound Death Stage.

When he looked at the Heavenly Cloud Fruits on the second level, the fruits had two colors. This meant that the Heavenly Cloud Fruits here were of a higher grade. But Lin Yun looked at them in disgust and only took one away this time before leaving.

On the other hand, Chen Zhong enviously looked at Lin Yun, wondering how he did it. Even he wouldn’t believe it if he didn’t witness it himself.

When Lin Yun raised his head, Chen Zhong immediately retracted his gaze and sat down. The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched. He naturally knew what was happening within Chen Zhong’s mind but couldn’t explain it. He could only blame himself for taking all the Heavenly Cloud Fruits on the first level.

Over a hundred saint disciples gathered here when they came to the third level. But most of those who could reach here were at least fifty years old or young peerless geniuses. In a nutshell, none of the people here were simple.

The Nether Orchid Holy Maiden and Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden were also around here, but no one dared to get close to them because of the cold atmosphere they were releasing.

There were multiple floating paintings emitting a saint aura. The saint aura contained a powerful sword intent, and everyone could sense a sharp and piercing atmosphere just by taking a few steps closer. When the sword aura landed on them, they could feel the pain deep into their souls.

There was a saint’s disciple from the Dao Yang Palace who was in the first transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and he lost after ten-odd exchanges with the white-clothed swordsman in the painting. When the painting closed up, this meant he failed to make it through the trial.

But he wasn’t hurrying to leave and sat down to rest. He wanted to see who could make it through this trial. One was to accumulate experience, and the other was to observe to see if he could gain insight.

This person was young, so it was glorious even if he failed, and no one here dared to look down on him. On the contrary, they were all filled with admiration for him. After all, the fact that he could come this far with his cultivation at the first transformation of the Nirvana Stage was enough to prove his strength.

“Gao Yang, rest well. Don’t be discouraged. You can always try again in the future. It’s already impressive that you can come this far with your cultivation,” Ye Feifan comforted this person.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The youth named Gao Yang nodded his head, “Okay. I’ll observe well when Senior Brother attempts the trial later.”

At the same time, someone finally noticed Lin Yun and Chen Zhong’s arrival.

“Two more people arrived?”

“That’s Chen Zhong!” A commotion broke out in the surroundings when everyone saw the grey-clothed youth, and everyone else couldn’t help turning their heads over. After all, Chen Zhong was a legend in the Nether Orchid Courtyard. So the saint disciples of the Nether Orchid Courtyard immediately stepped forth and greeted him.

“Ye Qingtian?!”

“Why is he also here?”

“What’s the matter with him? How did he come to the third level with his cultivation at the Profound Death Stage?”

Ye Qingtian’s arrival immediately placed Gao Yang in an awkward position. After all, his cultivation was at the first transformation of the Nirvana Stage, while Ye Qingtian was at the fourth channel of the Profound Death Stage.

“Don’t be affected by him. He’s a piece of trash who can’t even take a single attack from you, and his performance is poorer than yours,” Ye Feifan snorted with disdain filling his pupils.

A voice resounded, “Chen Zhong, it has been a decade since we last met. I wondered if you died in the Nine Nether Battlefield within the God Burial Forest.”

“I also thought that I’d die there. But I still returned,” Chen Zhong said.

“Why don’t we compete, then?” Ouyang He raised his brow with fighting spirits blazing within his pupils. When his fighting spirits began to blaze, a sword vibration echoed with multiple terrifying bolts of lightning shuttling around him like swords.

Thunder Sword Dao. Lin Yun inwardly muttered. It appeared that Ouyang He was stronger than he had imagined.

This also meant Chen Zhong wasn’t simple since Ouyang He could challenge him. This immediately placed Lin Yun in anticipation as he wondered how they would fight. One wielded the profound Thunder Sword Dao, while the other possessed unfathomable nether energy.

It would definitely be interesting if they fought, and this could also give Lin Yun more understanding of the experts in the Heavenly Dao Sect.

But Chen Zhong had disappointed him as he declined Ouyang He’s challenge. He said, “I’m not interested. Which one of you wants to attempt the trial?”

The third level wasn’t simple, and no one dared to act recklessly. Even experts at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage weren’t in a hurry to partake in the trial.

After all, the trials in the Celestial Purging Mountain couldn’t rely on cultivation. It involved eyesight, comprehension, aptitude, sword dao attainment, and fortune. After all, the benefits were great if anyone managed to make it through the fourth level. Just the three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit alone was enough to benefit them greatly.

“Let me go, then. Let us see who can ascend the peak first.” Ouyang He’s fighting spirit didn’t decline after Chen Zhong rejected him. He initially wanted to rest before attempting the trial, but his fighting spirits were piqued when he saw Chen Zhong.

He stepped forth and picked a painting. When the painting opened up, the flatly laid painting was like a stage, and Ouyang He began to fight with the figure on the painting.

But Chen Zhong merely glanced at him before finding a junior brother from the Nether Orchid Courtyard to enquire about Ye Qingtian’s background. When he heard what Ye Qingtian did, this left him speechless. He shook his head, and a disdainful expression reappeared on his face again.

He previously thought that Lin Yun was a figure, but it turned out he was a nobody. So he took out a jar of wine and poured a cup.

But just when he was going to drink it, the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden opened her eyes. When she saw Lin Yun, she smiled and waved her hand, “Ye Qingtian, come here.”

This immediately left Chen Zhong dumbfounded, wondering if he had misheard her.

“Ye Qingtian, I’ll kill you if you dare to go over!” But before Lin Yun could do anything, the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden said as she opened her eyes.

Chen Zhong’s smile froze on his face. When he gulped down the wine, he couldn’t taste the wine no matter what.
