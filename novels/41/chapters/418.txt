Chapter 419 - Establishing Presence?

Luo Yuhang’s face turned red when he heard Lin Yun’s words. He looked up at Lin Yun, who wore a playful smile and then gnashed his teeth, “I never imagined that someone as shameless as you existed in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Your actual cultivation is clearly in the ninth stage, but you lied to me on purpose!”

“I lied to you? I don’t recall claiming that I’m only in the eighth stage. You’re the one who declared that you can defeat me with your cultivation in the eighth stage when you saw me,” sneered Lin Yun. “What’s the matter? You forgot what you said so quickly?”

“What does it have to do with you? You’re just a piece of garbage. If I had used my full strength at the beginning, do you think that you could defeat me? You’re just a clown…” Luo Yuhang wiped the blood off the corner of his lips and he snorted, “I can’t be bothered to talk with you anymore.”

Luo Yuhang wanted to summon his sword back and return it to the sheath. But his sword was suddenly stepped on by a foot. The sword was a swordsman’s pride and stepping on it was the same as stepping at the swordsman’s face.

“What do you want?” Luo Yuhang’s face turned cold.

“You can leave, but leave this sword behind as payment for your lesson,” replied Lin Yun.

“Outrageous! This is a transcendent grade profound artifact. On what basis are you taking it away? Furthermore, do you think that you can hold onto the sword that belongs to me?” Luo Yuhang let out a roar and the suction force coming from his hand grew stronger. Simultaneously, Luo Yuhang’s sword aura also grew, which sent the nearby spectators flying away.

“Oh?” Lin Yun stomped on the sword and quelled its struggle. This made Luo Yuhang throw up a mouthful of blood. His internal organs were already injured by Lin Yun’s punch and now he could sense a buzzing noise ringing out in his mind.

“Get lost. Stop embarrassing yourself here,” replied Lin Yun faintly. He couldn’t even be bothered to look at Luo Yuhang. With his quasi-xiantian sword intent, it was a pipe dream for Luo Yuhang to retrieve his sword.

“Lin Yun, don’t push it!” Luo Yuhang was enraged. This sword was gifted to him by his senior brother and he cherished it as much as his own life. So it was the greatest humiliation to him that the sword was being stepped by someone.

Raising his brows, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a hint of rage. He barked, “Luo Yuhang, you have the guts to say those words? What? You didn’t think that you pushed it too far when you humiliated Senior Brother Chen, did you? You even said that all the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples are garbage. Why didn’t you think that you were pushing it back then? Who the hell are you to make any comments on my Sword Firmament Pavilion?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Bravo!” The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples cheered. Luo Yuhang’s comments from earlier had built up resentment in their hearts. They felt better seeing Lin Yun give Luo Yuhang a taste of his own medicine.

Lifting the sword with his leg and grabbing it with his hand, Lin Yun sent his origin energy into the sword. In the next second, Luo Yuhang’s sword shattered into pieces.

“If you insist on staying, then don’t blame me for humiliating you even further,” barked Lin Yun.

“Lin Yun, this isn’t over!” Luo Yuhang’s body was trembling and he couldn’t describe the grievance he was currently feeling. He believed that he wouldn’t lose to Lin Yun so easily if he fought with his full strength and that he wouldn’t be in this position if he didn’t try to show off.

“You better not show up at the Dragon Gate Competition. Otherwise, I’ll repay the humiliation I suffered today a hundred-fold!” Luo Yuhang looked at Lin Yun coldly before he turned to leave.

“Brother Luo…” Ye Feng’s face changed at this scene, but Luo Yuhang didn’t turn around.

“Junior Brother Lin, Luo Yuhang is ultimately a guest that I invited to the sect. Can’t you give him some face?” Ye Feng turned around with a cold gaze. “Do you think that you can disregard others now that you’ve recovered your cultivation? The sect is a place with rules and regulations. You’re still so stubborn after you’ve suffered once?”

“Yes, you’re right.” Lin Yun had no idea why Ye Feng was targeting him, but he gave Ye Feng face because he had seniority.

“Good. Luo Yuhang must not have gone far. Chase after him and apologize. My Sword Firmament Pavilion is the strongest sect of swordsmen in the Great Qin Empire, but we must have our elegance,” instructed Ye Feng as he nodded his head. He sounded as if he was a senior pointing out a junior’s mistakes.

“Apologize?” Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he scoffed, “Why don’t you go and apologize yourself? You’re the one who invited him, not me.”

“What are you saying? You’re saying that I, the senior brother, can’t give you any advice?” Ye Feng’s face changed along with his aura.

“Advising and reprimanding are two different things. It just so happens that I know what I’m doing and that I don’t need you to teach me.” Lin Yun looked at Ye Feng in the eyes and continued, “Why didn’t you stand up when Senior Brother Chen was being humiliated? You’re only stepping up after I taught that asshole a lesson? We were being humiliated and yet you’re asking us to apologize to him? I’m sorry, but I can’t do that.”

Suddenly, the atmosphere between Lin Yun and Ye Feng became tense. This made the spectators baffled because they had no idea what was going on. Lin Yun clearly had no faults, so why did Ye Feng call him to apologize?

“What is this Ye Feng trying to do?” Xin Yan’s face turned cold.

“Probably trying to establish his presence,” said Bloomphoenix Princess.

“Your Highness, you’re saying that this Ye Feng is using my Big Brother to establish his presence?” Li Wuyou instantly became unhappy.

“What else? He hasn’t been in the sect for many years. Now that he’s back, he wants to display his strength because he realized that everyone in the sect has forgotten him. It’s only natural that he makes a scene to establish his presence. I don’t believe that he’s not concerned that his name isn’t on the Newly Risen Ranking,” said the princess with a disdainful tone.

Her analysis was right. Ye Feng was already the strongest in the sect when he left. Now that he returned, he realized that he had been overshadowed by Lin Yun and Bai Lixuan. Furthermore, his name wasn’t in the Newly Risen Ranking.

This was why he wanted to establish his presence and the reason why his sights were set on Bai Lixuan and Lin Yun. But one of them was in seclusion while the other was imprisoned. So he could only try another way by inviting Luo Yuhang over.

He knew Luo Yuhang’s character and he had expected today’s events. If it wasn’t for Lin Yun, he would’ve stood up. However,he never imagined that Lin Yun would suddenly stand up and snatch away his role. Not only did Lin Yun recover his cultivation, but he even defeated Luo Yuhang. So who else could he pick on other than Lin Yun at this moment?

Lin Yun didn’t know what was going through Ye Feng’s mind right now. The only thing he knew was that Ye Feng was being unreasonable. Furthermore, he was already unhappy with Ye Feng’s attitude of looking down at Chen Xuanjun. The strongest on the Heaven Ranking was helping an outsider humiliate his fellow disciples?

“I’m just giving you advice. What’s the matter? Do you want me to personally teach you?” asked Ye Feng with a cold expression. In the next second, he unleashed his terrifying aura.

“Quasi-Violet Palace Realm!” The few elders seated on the high platform were startled before joy was written on their faces.

“Ye Feng, you’re already in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm?”

“Why would I return to the sect if I had no accomplishments while I was gone?” replied Ye Feng with pride.

“Haha, great!”

“You’re indeed worthy of being the strongest in my Sword Firmament Pavilion. This time, the sect has high hopes for the Dragon Gate Competition.”

“Ye Feng, you’re back at the right time.”

“Alright, you can calm down now. Lin Yun might have been a little impulsive earlier, but he also established my Sword Firmament Pavilion’s prestige. It’s enough to advise a fellow disciple as the senior brother.” The elders were overjoyed.

Bai Lixuan and Lin Yun might be new talents, but their cultivation was their greatest disadvantage, especially Lin Yun who shattered one of his profound veins. So the elders weren’t hopeful about the two of them in the Dragon Gate Competition.

This was the reason why they were so happy when they discovered that Ye Feng was in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm.

The elders didn’t demand anything from Lin Yun. After all, what he did wasn’t wrong. Not to mention that Lin Yun would surely shine brightly in the Dragon Gate Competition three years from now.

Ye Feng could hear that the elders wanted to resolve this matter peacefully. He smiled, “Alright. It’s fine to be a little arrogant when you’re young, but Junior Brother Lin, I still have to advise you. Luo Yuhang’s words might sound ugly, but what he said isn’t wrong. You’re courting death to participate in the Dragon Gate Competition with your current strength.”

“Oh? What wise advice do you have?” Lin Yun looked at Ye Feng with a playful smile. He could vaguely sense what Ye Feng was thinking. Ye Feng probably wanted to show off his presence now that he returned and Lin Yun coincidentally showed up in front of him. How could he ignore this opportunity?

“You don’t believe me?” Ye Feng narrowed his eyes into slits and he revealed an amicable smile, “If you don’t believe me, you and I can exchange a move. I can show you what strength really is. Compared to genuine experts, your current strength is nothing.”

“Please, advise me.” Lin Yun agreed to the battle instantly. He wasn’t confident in winning if they were to fight for real. After all, Ye Feng had joined the sect six years ago and his cultivation had reached the quasi-Violet Palace Realm.

Ye Feng’s cultivation was a lot higher than his, but Lin Yun wasn’t afraid if they were just exchanging a single move. After all, he had the spiritual runes painting within his body, which would give Ye Feng quite a surprise.

Ye Feng wants to use me to establish his presence? He’s courting death.
