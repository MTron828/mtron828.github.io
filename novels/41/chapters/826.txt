Chapter 827 - Fight!

An ear-piercing sound rang out as Lin Yun arrived on the stage first. Many people were surprised by his eager behavior because Yan Long’zi was one of the three kings. With his strong physique, not even Fang Hanluo’s quasi-spiritual sword intent could wound him. This meant that Yan Long’zi’s body was the bane of all swordsmen. Realistically speaking, Lin Yun didn’t have a good chance at winning.

When the crowd thought about the grudge that Yan Long’zi and Lin Yun had, they expected him to cower or surrender. However, Lin Yun fearlessly stepped onto the stage with a calm and collected attitude. It was as if he never put Yan Long’zi in his eyes.

“Are you in a rush to die?” Yan Long’zi’s eyes flashed with rage as he coldly barked, “Lin Yun, I told you that I would let you go if you surrender. But since you want to court death, I won’t let you go until you beg on your knees! If I can’t even do that, I don’t deserve to be called Yan Long’zi.”

Yan Long’zi grit his teeth as he spoke and everyone could feel the killing intent in his tone.

“How cold…”

“What terrifying killing intent. It looks like Yan Long’zi is determined to kill Lin Yun.”

“Haha, of course he is. He’s been slapped by Lin Yun time and time again.”

“Yan Long’zi deserves it! He’s too aloof and arrogant.”

“Lin Yun is finished. He’s probably going to be humiliated.” The atmosphere became even more tense when Yan Long’zi revealed his killing intent.

When Yan Long’zi landed on the stage, he looked at Lin Yun coldly, “You’re quite courageous. Didn’t you hear what I said? All swordsmen are trash. No swordsman has ever made the top three in the history of the banquet. I’m going to make you regret showing up.”

Contrary to everyone’s expectations, Lin Yun was still composed. However, the killing aura in his heart was rising because he was about to get revenge on behalf of the Indigothunder Dragonvulture. Slowly grabbing onto his sword, he said, “You’re not the first person that’s said those words to me. However, all of those people have already died.”

“This is meaningless,” smiled Yan Long’zi as his flame intent surged. His aura was even more violent than when he faced Fang Hanluo. He was bringing forth an immense pressure that was filled with killing aura and demonic aura.

The flame dragon bloodline in his body boiled because, in his eyes, Lin Yun was his prey. As he slowly approached Lin Yun, the flames on his body grew even more condensed as a heatwave swept out.

His powerful aura caused the Nine Dragon Lake to boil violently with a layer of mist rising up from the lake. In fact, the water was evaporating at a shocking speed. No one could imagine how terrifying Yan Long’zi’s accumulated energy would be.

Recalling how Yan Long’zi broke Fang Hanluo’s Indigo Frost Battle Physique with a single punch, the crowd began to worry. Is Yan Long’zi going to defeat Lin Yun with one punch too?

Yan Long’zi snickered and suddenly charged forward. He appeared before Lin Yun and threw out a punch. Instantly, he unleashed 100 cauldrons worth of strength. Even though everyone was prepared for an attack of this magnitude, they couldn’t help but feel pain from the terrifying shockwave.

The punch made gigantic waves soar into the sky. However, Lin Yun still didn’t move. He was still facing Yan Long’zi’s punch with his sword by his waist.

“What is he doing?”

“He’s not so intimidated that he can’t draw his sword, right?”

“That’s probably it. Think about it, Yan Long’zi’s punch can kill an ordinary Heavenly Soul Realm expert.” Everyone’s face sank when they saw this scene.

Suddenly, Lin Yun showed life as he stuck his sword into the ground. In the next second, a dragon roar echoed out as dragon runes began to wander on the surface of Lin Yun’s body.

Clenching his fist, Lin Yun also threw out a punch with 100 cauldrons worth of strength. Lin Yun actually took Yan Long’zi’s punch head-on, which caused a huge commotion.

“Damn it!” Yan Long’zi’s face turned dark at this scene because Lin Yun was relying on physique to clash with him. Losing control of his temper, Yan Long’zi stomped on the ground. The stage trembled as he roared, “You’re courting death. Flame Dragon Fist–Shattering Space!”

His flame intent combined with his flame dragon bloodline to manifest a gigantic dragon claw that sliced at Lin Yun.

“Puny tricks.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed and lightning began to flicker on the surface of his body. Circulating the azure dragon energy within his body, his blood boiled and a dragon roar echoed out.

Lin Yun’s hair began to flutter violently in the wind as terrifying power filled every corner of his body. The dragon runes left his body and were replaced with purple lightning. Lin Yun threw another punch at Yan Long’zi.

With a cracking sound, the dragon claw shattered before Lin Yun’s punch. The audience exclaimed because Lin Yun received another one of Yan Long’zi’s attacks unscathed.

“Isn’t this a little too crazy?”

“Was Lin Yun’s power always this strong? His physique is a little too terrifying. He must have refined many fruits. How can his physique be on the same level as Yan Long’zi who possesses the flame dragon bloodline? This is incredible!” Those who weren’t hopeful for Lin Yun instantly became excited.

Yan Long’zi completely lost his mind when his attack failed. The condensed his flame intent into a flame dragon with crimson flames in its eyes. “Flame Dragon Fist–Shattering Star!”

A ferocious aura exploded from Yan Long’zi as his punch descended down. Empowered by the flame dragon behind him, the clouds exploded with countless star fragments that fell like a meteor shower.

Every single meteor left large cracks on the stage, causing the stage to violently shake. Yan Long’zi laughed because he was confident that Lin Yun would die if he didn’t draw his sword, “The game has just started!”

Yan Long’zi was hidden in the meteor shower and continued to put power into his fist. In the end, his fist became as bright as the sun as it outshined the meteors.

However, Lin Yun still showed no signs of panic. Instead, his blood began to boil as the Iris Flower in his violet palace started to open. When 99 petals bloomed, he combined his azure dragon energy with his origin energy.

“Great Wind Scripture!” A powerful gale exploded from Lin Yun. The secret technique from ancient times was fully unleashed by Lin Yun. Then, he empowered it with his Azure Dragon Sword Aura, creating a dazzling brilliance on the stage.

Clearly, he wasn’t finished as he roared once more, “Azure Dragon Enneaform–Octaform!”

Wind and lightning started to rage as over 100 rumbles of lightning were heard. Then, dragon runes began to coil around Lin Yun, allowing him to soar into the sky to face Yan Long’zi’s punch.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
