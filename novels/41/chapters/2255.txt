Chapter 2256 - Sovereign Constellation

“I… seem able to use this sword as well.” Su Ziyao said.

When Lin Yun looked down, he saw that the Flower Burial Sword was shining brightly in Su Ziyao’s hands, and it showed no signs of weakening after leaving Lin Yun. He turned to Su Ziyao and smiled, “The Flower Burial Sword has acknowledged you.”

This was interesting because he had never seen the Flower Burial Sword reaching such rapport with someone else like this before.

Su Ziyao’s eyes shone brightly, and she exclaimed, “This sword is magical. It feels as though it has become one with my body.”

“This…?” Lin Yun felt that his sword aura was being exhausted as she swung the Flower Burial Sword around. This made Lin Yun’s eyes flicker as he formed a seal, circulating the Great Profound Sword Canon and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. The next second, a dazzling radiance shone on the Flower Burial Sword, and the power increased.

This naturally amazed Lin Yun because it was unbelievable. Most importantly, Su Ziyao seemed to have grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent when she held onto the Flower Burial Sword. She had long reached the Saint Realm, so her strength was stronger than his own. With the help of the Flower Burial Sword, this was equivalent to their two strengths being combined.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Even Lil’ Purple was amazed and couldn’t comprehend what was happening. She could understand how the Flower Burial Sword fused with Lin Yun’s sword heart. After all, there was a saying in ancient times about using blood to nourish the sword and hiding the sword in the heart. But she couldn’t comprehend how Su Ziyao could use Lin Yun’s sword intent.

Suddenly, a cold ray flew over. Before Lin Yun could respond, Su Ziyao stabbed the Flower Burial Sword in his chest. When the sword plunged into Lin Yun’s chest, light shone as the sword began to fuse in until the sword fully entered Lin Yun’s heart. Throughout this entire process, Lin Yun didn’t feel any pain.

Just when Lin Yun thought it was the end, the ‘broken sword’ within his body released a vibration when the Flower Burial Sword entered his sword heart. This vibration appeared for only a split second, but Lin Yun had sensed it, and he was deeply shocked in his heart. It was that ‘broken sword’ within his body, and he wondered if it could be merged with the sword heart and be pulled out.

But he soon recalled that figure he met in the Sword Assembly, who warned him not to pull out that sword.

“Your face doesn’t seem right. Are you okay?” Su Ziyao asked with concern.

“I’m fine,” Lin Yun replied after coming to his senses. He had questions in his heart, but this wasn’t the moment to ask them, since it was only his speculation.

“Let’s try the Heaven Burial Constellation,” Lil’ Purple urged.

“Okay.” Lin Yun suppressed his doubts and nodded. He was also filled with anticipation because he had been curious about how powerful the Heaven Burial Constellation was after witnessing Li Feibai’s Sovereign Constellation. He had never released the complete constellation before, and many people didn’t know that he possessed a Sovereign Constellation.

When Lil’ Purple and Su Ziyao backed off, Lin Yun began bringing out his constellation, and three paintings flew out from his body with a thought. They were Qiongqi, Kunpeng, and Flying Serpent, each giving off a powerful aura.

Lin Yun’s cultivation had reached the third stage of the Heavenly Origin Phase, the Saint Constellation Stage. This was also the pinnacle of the Quasi-Saint Realm. With the empowerment, the power of his constellation would reach an unimaginable height, and the three ominous beasts looked as though they were alive in the paintings.

But that wasn’t all; a crimson radiance shone onto Lin Yun as two more paintings flew out, the Aurora Dragon and Nether Spirit. These two ominous beasts had long disappeared in ancient times and had never shown themselves again.

As a powerful pressure swept out from Lin Yun, he instantly broke through the restriction of the Quasi-Saint, and the aura he gave off was comparable to a second-stage Saint Lord.

Right then, Lin Yun finally felt a little pressure because the power within his body felt like it would rip his body apart. Even so, he hadn’t reached his limit, he only felt a slight pressure.

“I could only summon three paintings in the past, but I can summon five now…” Sensing the aura of the ominous beasts, even Lin Yun felt a little afraid. But even if those ominous beasts were terrifying, there was no way they could be compared to a Sovereign Constellation because they weren’t complete entities and couldn’t connect with the Sovereign Constellation beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven.

“Not enough.” This still wasn’t comparable to Li Feibai’s Sovereign Constellation, so he summoned the last three paintings, the Demonic Phoenix, Ghost Null, and Winged Dragon.

When the eight paintings opened up, they were a hundred meters above Lin Yun, looking like they wanted to escape. Beads of sweat soon appeared on Lin Yun’s forehead. It wasn’t because his physique couldn’t bear it, but that he couldn’t suppress the eight ominous beasts.

“The eight primordial ominous beasts.” Su Ziyao’s eyes shone while looking nervous. She was knowledgeable and knew the origin of the eight ominous beasts, thus knowing how tough it was to control them. If Lin Yun wasn’t careful with them, he would suffer a backlash.

Under Lin Yun’s control, the eight paintings slowly came together.

Seeing the anxious look on Su Ziyao, Lil’ Purple was surprised because she never expected Su Ziyao to be so nervous. She always seemed indifferent and cold. But she wasn’t bad, so Lil' Purple comforted, “Don’t worry. This Sovereign Constellation was created by Lin Yun, it belongs to him. This is a crucial step before becoming a Saint Realm, and he could do it. After all, he wants to become a Sword God in the future.”

Su Ziyao was briefly stunned. She finally knew why she hadn’t seen this constellation before, and now she couldn’t help feeling heartache, looking at Lin Yun. She said, “He must’ve suffered a lot, right?”

Recalling when Lin Yun created his own Sovereign Constellation, Lil’ Purple sighed, “Yeah. He suffered a lot.”

Lin Yun nearly died on the Profound Wither Island when he exhausted all his vitality. Just when she was about to speak, the eight paintings combined and formed into a painting that released a powerful aura. A terrifying pressure swept over, making Lil’ Purple’s hair flutter as she crossed her hands in front of her, and bracing her body. A powerful gale blew in her ears, making it difficult to remain standing.

Just when she was about to be blown away, a figure stood before her with a dragon’s roar echoing about. When an indigo-golden radiance suddenly shone, the dragon aura combined with an imperial aura resisted the incoming aura. This immediately alleviated Lil’ Purple’s pressure as she gasped for breath.

“This woman…” Lil’ Purple held onto her chin, looking unconvinced.

“It looks like you haven’t recovered yet,” Su Ziyao said. She had long noticed that Lil’ Purple had greatly exhausted herself after she fell into the Fallen God Valley. She had exhausted all her divine phoenix energy to ensure Lin Yun could come down.

“I have,” Lil’ Purple said.

“He’s going to succeed.” Su Ziyao reached out to carry Lil’ Purple, placing the latter on her shoulders. This time, Lil’ Purple could finally see what was happening with Lin Yun.

“Thank you.” Lil’ Purple thanked shyly. She knew it was generous for Su Ziyao to put her on her shoulder. This was a form of trust and backing off. She said, “I have misunderstood you in the past, saying that you’re fierce and not friendly at all.”

“You’re right. I’m not friendly, and I’m fiercer than you think. But you’re someone he wants to protect, so I naturally have to protect you as well. Furthermore, I will also need your help in my plan,” Su Ziyao smiled. As they spoke, the eight ominous breasts began to fight amongst them as they released a powerful aura.

The terrifying ferocity they gave off nearly leaked out from the painting, giving the appearance that they would tear it apart the next moment. Their ferocity was already terrifying in their own paintings, not to mention when all eight were in the same painting. This was taxing for Lin Yun, but he bore this great pressure because this was a crucial moment.

“Behave yourselves!” Lin Yun’s gaze became cold as he roared, releasing a dragon’s roar, a phoenix’s cry, and a sword vibration. The sword vibration also created ripples in the surrounding space, causing heaven and earth to tremble as they clashed. If it was an ordinary Saint Lord that was here, they would have been heavily injured from the soundwave alone.

When the sword aura was unleashed, a painting appeared above the eight ominous beasts. It was a divine sword. When the divine sword appeared, the eight ominous beasts became quiet and the complete Sovereign Constellation finally appeared.

As Lin Yun hovered in the air, the majestic Sovereign Constellation expanded to a hundred feet before it stopped—a swordsman was donning the Azure Saint Cloth with his hair fluttering in the wind like a young sovereign.

“Eight ominous beasts, burying heaven with one sword.” Lin Yun took a deep breath, sensing the massive power within his body. When the Sovereign Constellation appeared, his sword aura alone was a few times stronger than before. Most importantly, he still hadn’t connected with the Sovereign Constellation beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven.

“No wonder why Li Feibai is so confident. A Sovereign Constellation is a little too powerful…” Lin Yun muttered with his eyes shining brightly. With just the Sovereign Constellation, he should be able to charge out of the Fallen God Valley, right?

As Lin Yun’s thoughts flashed, he came to his senses, noticing Su Ziyao and Lil’ Purple, who were not too far away.

“When did they become so harmonious?” Lin Yun was shocked because Lil’ Purple was sitting on Su Ziyao’s shoulders, and they looked like they were having a good relationship. He dispersed the Sovereign Constellation and appeared before the two ladies with a smile.

“Congratulations on grasping a Sovereign Constellation,” Su Ziyao smiled as she placed Lil’ Purple down on the ground.

“Ziyao, you should’ve also grasped a Sovereign Constellation, right?” Lin Yun asked.
