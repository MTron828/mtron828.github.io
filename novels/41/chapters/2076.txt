Chapter 2077 - Eight Ominous Beasts (2)

As Feng Shaoyu was sent flying back, the intense pain within his body made him throw out blood. This was a sign that Feng Shaoyu suffered serious internal injuries and would have died without his indigo saint aura.

This made the faces of everyone on the observation stand change, including Feng Wuji. Everyone who felt that Feng Shaoyu would win this fight was shocked.

“How is this possible? Not even a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase can suppress Ye Qingtian. Isn’t Feng Shaoyu a little too weak?”

“It’s not that Feng Shaoyu isn’t strong enough, but that Ye Qingtian was too strong. Two sword stars means he could attack and defend as he wishes and he can’t be unestimated even without a sword in his hand.”

“The most important factor is his attainment in sword dao. There’s no way Feng Shaoyu can be compared with him in talent. This isn’t a problem that can be resolved by just reaching the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm.”

“Is Ye Qingtian really going to obtain the Cauldron Sword?” Everyone couldn’t believe the shockwave it would cause after Ye Qingtian obtained the Cauldron Sword. If that happened, it would shock the Kunlun Realm and even the Divine Dragon Empire would be shocked by the news.

Just obtaining the Sovereign Saint Artifact wasn’t enough to cause that shock. But it was a completely different story with the addition of Ye Qingtian’s unrivaled talent in the sword.

“It’s impossible for me to lose! I’m a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase! How can I possibly lose to you?!” Feng Shaoyu nearly collapsed. He wouldn’t be so affected if he lost at the Azure Origin Phase because he had some preparations for that. But he never expected to lose after reaching the Indigo Origin Phase, since it would be completely embarrassing.

He had to retaliate and fight no matter what.

Right then, Lin Yun soared to the sky as his hands clasped together, unleashing a sword ray from the sky. Even before the sword ray descended, the lake was torn apart. Even without a sword, Lin Yun could become his sword.

As Lin Yun basked in sword intent, he looked like a celestial descending from the sky. This scene made Feng Shaoyu’s scalp numb because he knew he couldn’t take this attack head-on.

“Ye Qingtian, you’ve forced me!” Feng Shaoyu’s hands clasped together as an ancient seal appeared on his chest. In the next second, a dazzling radiance exploded from him as a sword array appeared beneath him.

“A secret treasure?” Lin Yun frowned because he noticed that Feng Shaoyu must’ve fused an ancient secret treasure into his heart, making Lin Yun curious about what Feng Shaoyu was trying to do.

Lin Yun was suddenly alarmed because he sensed a dangerous aura coming from Feng Shaoyu and spread his arms apart, swiftly retreating.

“Hahaha! It’s already too late! Eight Ominous Souls Locking Array!” Feng Shaoyu roared as he laughed. When he activated the secret treasure, an ancient sword array appeared beneath him and eight ominous beasts began to appear.

Feng Shaoyu stood in the center of the array and tugged with his hand. The space in front of him was like a waterfall being tugged and Lin Yun was pulled down from the sky with eight shackles flying out from the eight ominous beasts’ mouths.

“The Eight Ominous Souls Locking Array!”

“Oh my god! That’s the secret array of the Hidden Sword Manor, and only the manor master’s lineage knows about it. Is this fair…?”

“Ye Qingtian is finished! He’s about to be caught by the shackles!” An exclamation came from the surroundings.

Feng Shaoyu said, “Ye Qingtian, you want to use me as your stepping stone? Dream on!”

Feng Shaoyu wore a maniacal expression as he controlled the secret treasure, wanting to lock onto Lin Yun.

This made Lin Yun’s scalp numb because the eight ominous beasts lifted the sky, and each beast released an ancient aura. The terrifying power caused the surrounding space to tremble as though everything was about to bow to the eight ominous beasts.

Lin Yun felt like he had fallen into an abyss, his limbs becoming cold. He even couldn’t move and take out the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, even if he wanted to.

“Damn it!” Lin Yun was shocked and furious.

“Hahaha! Ye Qingtian, accept your death! This is the secret technique of my Hidden Sword Manor!” Feng Shaoyu laughed.

At the palace, everyone was stumped by this scene.

A figure appeared out of nowhere. It was Lin Yun’s second senior sister, Feng Yu. She furiously looked at Feng Wuji, “Is this fun?!”

Feng Wuji was indifferent as he said, “What’s wrong with defeating the opponent? Even if he’s a true dragon, he can only kneel today!”

While Feng Yu was furious and helpless, the eight shackles finally reached Lin Yun. They didn’t coil around his body but wrapped around his right wrist. This was weird. It was as though the Eight Ominous Souls Locking Array wasn’t trapping Lin Yun, but that Lin Yun had control over the eight ominous beasts instead.

“Mhm?” Feng Shaoyu frowned.

Right then, a voice resounded within Lin Yun’s ears that only he could hear.

“The phantom of the Flying Serpent bewitches all, disrupting the circulation of stars and directions. Flying Serpent greets Milord!”

“Qiongqi’s might sets the world, annihilating everything along with Yin and Yang. Qiongqi greets Milord!”

“With a pair of eyes like the sun and moon, freezing all of eternity with one thought. Aurora Dragon greets Milord!”

“Kunpeng rises with the wind like the sun, soaring straight to the nine heavens. Kunpeng greets Milord!”

“Slicing through the primeval chaos on the summit of Kunlun, unleashing great prowess as the sun rises. Winged Dragon greets Milord!”

“Looking back in the nine nethers, not even deities and gods would dare to look directly. Demonic Phoenix greets Milord!”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Born before the primeval chaos was formed, and annihilating divine dragons with a single breath. Ghoul Null greets Milord!”

“With the appearance of the Nether Spirit, one of the four seasons would disappear before it. Nether Spirit greets Milord!”

Lin Yun’s eardrums buzzed, and he was dazed for a moment. He involuntarily grabbed the shackles and the eight ominous beasts fell to their knees, lowering their prideful heads in Lin Yun’s direction.
