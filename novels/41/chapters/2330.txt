Chapter 2331 - Brother, Say Something

Anyone could tell how precious a Silver Dao Fruit was judging from his face. In the entire Qilin Mountain, there weren’t many who could obtain a Silver Dao Fruit. Even those on the Brandished Dragon Ranking didn’t obtain a Golden Dao Fruit, but Lin Yun and Ji Zixi did.

The Blood Bone Gate’s Bai Yu opened his eyes with a Silver Dao Fruit in his palm. He loosened his brows, and all the depression he felt earlier disappeared. A Silver Dao Fruit was enough for his Sovereign Dao to improve along with his martial intent. This fruit was equivalent to ten years of bitter cultivation. Even geniuses like them on the Brandished Dragon Ranking strongly desired the Silver Dao Fruit.

“Bai Yu, I heard Lin Jiangxian defeated you?” Ao Jue grinned. “The three of you against one. Xiong Tiannan ran first while Xin Wuhen was frightened away. As for you, you’ve been beaten by Lin Jiangxian and didn’t even dare to utter a word.”

Bai Yu’s face became ugly, and his good mood vanished. Seeing this, Ao Jue smiled, “Relax. The rumors are exaggerated, so tell me what happened.”

“I don’t know what’s wrong with Xiong Tiannan and Xin Wuhen, but I did suffer in her hands. Perhaps it’s because I fought with the Emerald Demonic Ape and was heavily injured,” Bai Yu said.

“Is it not because Lin Jiangxian has grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent?” Ao Jue said with a playful smile.

“You’ve belittled me. Can the Divine Light Sword Intent at lesser mastery suppress me?” Bai Yu said coldly. “Not to mention, I was already guarding against it. Even if she surprises me, she can do nothing to me.”

“You’re really stubborn,” Ao Jue muttered.

“What did you say?” Bai Yu asked furiously.

“Nothing. I’m just saying that you’re stubborn,” Ao Jue smiled.

Bai Yu snorted and ignored Ao Jue. Right then, Mu Xiuhan opened his eyes with a Silver Dao Fruit. When Bai Yu and Ao Jue saw it, their gazes became complicated, and they felt tremendous pressure.

“Even Mu Xiuhan can only obtain a Silver Dao Fruit,” Ao Jue said.

“There are rumors that the Golden Dao Fruit can allow someone to grasp a Sovereign Dao. They can see the Creation Door and listen to deities' voices.”

“Generally speaking, the Sovereign Monument won’t produce a Golden Dao Fruit. I’m sure it’s no surprise this time as well.”

As everyone discussed, Bai Yu and Ao Jue believed that if Mu Xiuhan couldn’t obtain a Golden Dao Fruit, no one else would have the chance to. But taking a few more Silver Dao Fruits would be an excellent opportunity for them and was far more potent than the saint fruits and fortunes they obtained.

In the faction of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion, Lin Jiangxian looked at the Silver Dao Fruit in her hand, with her eyes becoming dim. The Silver Dao Fruit still wasn’t enough to satisfy her. When she turned around and couldn’t find Lin Yun nor Ji Zixi, she asked, “Where’s Lin Yun?”

Wu Yuhua whispered and explained the conflict between Lin Yun, Xi Ruo, and Chang Jun. Hearing that, Lin Jiangxian shook her head, “What ignorance.”

Wu Yuhua was curious and asked, “Chief, why do you look at Lin Yun differently?”

There was only Wu Yuhua and Lin Jiangxian around. So Lin Jiangxian didn’t hide it and explained, “The Kunlun Realm is the home of the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity. At his prime, even the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity was inferior to him. But the Heavenly Path is broken, slowing down the cultivation of saint dao. That doesn’t mean there aren’t any geniuses, and I can tell Lin Yun is extraordinary at first glance.”

“What if you made a mistake?” Wu Yuhua asked.

“So what if I made a mistake? Do I have any losses? I would take care of righteous cultivators in the Azure Cloud Realm, so why wouldn’t I care for friends from the Kunlun Realm?” Lin Jiangxian smiled.

Wu Yuhua was stumped before he swiftly figured it out. So what if Lin Jiangxian made a mistake? She had no losses either way.

“I’m curious what kind of dao fruit Lin Yun can obtain. I’ll ask him about it when he’s back,” Lin Jiangxian said as she looked at the Sovereign Monument again, before entering that illusory realm.

“How does it feel?” Lin Yun asked. Just earlier, Ji Zixi refined a Golden Dao Fruit, and Lin Yun was curious about the effects.

“I saw a door and some whispers,” Ji Zixi said excitedly. “I have never heard them before, but I had a strong feeling that it’s the voice of a deity guiding me. Furthermore, I can see endless golden fortune behind that door. More accurately speaking, I’m unsure if they’re golden fortune because they looked like the aura of a certain origin. My Great Sun Dao also improved by 50%!”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up with shock on his face. If a 50% increase was the effect of refining the first time, the saint dao of his Sword Dao would increase by 5,000! Not including the deity’s voice, the Golden Dao Fruit was a treasure.

After a brief hesitation, Ji Zixi said, “But I found it a waste. The effect might be greater if I can find a place and go into seclusion.”

“There’s no need to hurry. We still have time,” Lin Yun smiled. The Sovereign Monument would grant a dao fruit every four hours, and there were eight chances, according to Xiong Tiannan.

The Othershore Flower couldn’t hold back and looked at Lin Yun with its flower bud on his shoulder.

“You want to comprehend as well?” Lin Yun smiled.

The Othershore Flower fluttered and nodded.

“This Othershore Flower is really interesting,” Ji Zixi smiled.

Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to grant the Othershore Flower a strand of Nirvana Dao.

“Let’s change locations.” Lin Yun wanted to test the Sovereign Monument and see if there were daos above Sovereign Daos, along with the legendary Eternal Dao Fruit!

A few minutes later, Lin Yun circulated the Nirvana Dao and looked at the Sovereign Monument. Nirvana Dao was extraordinary. It suppressed the illusory world the moment he entered. While everyone else was comprehending, Lin Yun casually walked around like he was strolling in his garden.

“You stay here while I’ll go around,” Lin Yun said, walking around the Qilin Mountain. The Sovereign Monument was too easy for him, and he wasn’t interested in it anymore. He was only concerned about the Eternal Dao Fruit. Walking around, he would observe the Sovereign Monument from different angles.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Nirvana,” Lin Yun muttered whenever he reached a new spot. But it was a pity he couldn’t enter the illusory world if he thought about nirvana.

“Didn’t you say you can present what we think?” Lin Yun muttered, looking at the Sovereign Monument with a playful expression.

“Who’s that fellow walking around?”

“He thinks he can find something different?”

“He probably can’t see anything and became anxious.”

“Hahaha! A mediocre!” Lin Yun’s action was very striking and attracted everyone’s attention. After all, everyone was seated while Lin Yun walked around.

“Haha, it’s good that he left, or he would only embarrass us,” Chang Jun smiled.

Xi Ruo laughed, “Yeah, how embarrassing. Yet, the chief treats him as a treasure.”

“Let’s not care about him. If I have another opportunity to obtain an Indigo Dao Fruit, I’ll give it to you,” Chang Jun smiled.

Xi Ruo’s eyes shone, and she smiled, “Thank you, Senior Brother. You’re the best!”

When four hours passed, the Sovereign Monument shone with dao fruits appearing in everyone’s hands. Lin Yun looked at the Golden Dao Fruit in his hand. He didn’t expect the Sovereign Monument to give him another one when he didn’t enter for long. What is this? The Sovereign Monument is trying to bribe me?

Lin Yun looked at the Sovereign Monument and helplessly shook his head.

Just when Lin Yun stowed the Golden Dao Fruit, a voice resounded in his ears, “What’s that in your hands? Let me take a look at it.”

When Lin Yun turned around, he saw the white-clothed youth who was after the Emerald Demonic Ape back then. His name seemed to be Xin Wuhen.

“What has it got to do with you?” Lin Yun smiled.

“You’re not a disciple of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion, right? Even Lin Jiangxian can’t protect you here.” Xin Wuhen smiled threateningly. He saw a glimmer of gold earlier, but he wasn’t too sure about it. It was too ridiculous for Lin Yun to obtain a Golden Dao Fruit, but he wanted to verify it.

“Get lost,” Lin Yun replied indifferently. Someone who even feared lesser mastery Divine Light Sword Intent was nothing in his eyes.

Xin Wuhen’s face sank. He appeared before Lin Yun, pushing his palm forth, and smiled, “What a joke that I would try to talk to you peacefully. I shouldn’t have wasted my time with someone like you.”

Lin Yun’s clothes fluttered as he circulated his two sword canons and pushed his palm forth. After a huge collision, Xin Wuhen looked at Lin Yun with shock after taking three steps back to stabilize himself. He couldn’t believe he failed to take Lin Yun down after using 30% of his strength.

“It looks like I have belittled you!” Xin Wuhen’s face became dark as he dashed forth once more. But before Lin Yun could move, a person appeared before Lin Yun, sending Xin Wuhen flying back.

“Xin Wuhen, are you courting death to bully my brother?” Xiong Tiannan said fiercely.

Xiong Tiannan moved decisively when he saw this, just when he was worried that he had no chance to perform. He ferociously looked at Xin Wuhen, raising the cauldron in his hand, “Did you really consider yourself to be someone? Get lost, and don’t let me see you!”

He wouldn’t treat Xin Wuhen this way if it was under normal circumstances, but he knew he couldn’t cower now. Even if he couldn’t defeat Xin Wuhen, Lin Yun would be around, so he wouldn’t have to fear him. Others didn’t know Lin Yun’s strength, but he knew it well.

A sword ray flew out and landed before Lin Yun. Even Lin Jiangxian came over and coldly looked at Xin Wuhen, “Xin Wuhen, have you asked me if you can touch him?”

A streak resounded as Ji Zixi also rushed over with her cloak, but the Othershore Flower released a dreamy radiance. Lin Yun still hadn’t moved, and yet Xin Wuhen’s aura was already suppressed. This made Xin Wuhen furious that Xiong Tiannan dared to speak to him in this manner without giving him any face.

Most importantly, his ranking was higher than Xiong Tiannan. But before he could do anything, Lin Jiangxian quickly came over, far surpassing his expectations.

Lin Yun said with a playful smile, “Xin Wuhen, I believe there’s a misunderstanding between us.”

Xin Wuhen awkwardly smiled, “It's a misunderstanding, and I apologize for my earlier actions.”

“It doesn’t matter,” Lin Yun casually smiled, signaling that Xin Wuhen could get lost now.

This made Xin Wuhen furious, but there was nothing he could do, so he could only leave. This scene naturally shocked everyone as they looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.

“Brother Lin, tell me if you see him again, and I’ll help you give him a beating,” Xiong Tiannan patted his chest. When Xin Wuhen heard this, he nearly fainted from the anger.
