Chapter 1387 - It Has Been Ten Moves (2)

“Haha.” Jiang Tao smiled. When he was done, he drew his sword, and his saint sword shone from the light reflected on it. Simultaneously, white astral energy poured out of his body and enveloped his sword, making his saint sword look even more extraordinary.

Jiang Tao naturally practiced the cultivation technique from the Flowing Cloud Sect. But as a member of the Jiang Saint Clan, he also cultivated the Jiang Clan’s Aquacloud Sword Sutra, which made the astral energy flowing on the sword look like misty clouds.

“Draw your sword.” Jiang Tao coldly said as he looked at Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun shook his head and replied, “There’s no need for me to draw my sword since we’re only having a friendly spar.”

“Flower Burial, you’re arrogant. Then let me see how strong you are!” Jiang Tao attacked first after a cold snort.

He had used a sword technique at the level of holy spirit martial techniques right from the start. Since they weren’t far from each other to begin with, his thrust unleashed a torrent of sword rays over at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun inwardly nodded his head when he saw Jiang Tao’s attack. Jiang Tao’s attainment in the sword path wasn’t bad. Aside from grasping sky sword intent, he was also proficient in cloud intent. This was the path most swordsmen would take. They would empower their sword intent with another martial intent before it reached the height of firmament sword intent.

But it was a pity that Jiang Tao ran into him. They weren’t on the same level. The firmament sword intent represented the sky, and how could mere tricks be compared to the sky?

Lin Yun used his fingers like a sword with a faint light enveloping his fingertips before he easily blocked Jiang Tao’s sword with a swipe of his fingers. Lin Yun didn’t just stop Jiang Tao’s attack, but he also sealed off his next move. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If there was an expert there, they would be able to tell that Jiang Tao had already lost this ‘friendly’ spar.

“H-How is this possible?!” Jiang Tao’s face changed as he quickly retreated before he unleashed his attacks once more, unleashing several attacks. But every single time, Lin Yun would just simply swipe his fingers to block Jiang Tao’s attack and force him to retreat.

This left everyone in the surroundings dumbfounded, with their jaws nearly falling off. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing. Some of them might not be able to see anything from the first move, but it was already the seventh move. So even an idiot could tell that Lin Yun’s attainment in the sword path was much higher than Jiang Tao's.

Lin Yun was like a world tree, while Jiang Tao was like a weed. There was no way the two could even be compared to each other. But what was even more terrifying was that they could tell that Jiang Tao’s sword techniques were frightening, at least for them. But Lin Yun could easily resolve Jiang Tao’s attacks, making Jiang Tao look like a child swinging his sword before Lin Yun.

“It has been ten moves.” Ten moves later, Lin Yun brushed away Jiang Tao’s sword before he pushed his palm forth, forcing Jiang Tao to take three steps back before he could stabilize his footing.

“I’m not done yet!” Jiang Tao’s pupils flashed with rage. He was enraged this time and wanted to bring out his cultivation to suppress Lin Yun.

“Junior Brother, watch out!” Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan called out.

Lin Yun was surprised by Jiang Tao’s sudden change in action, but he swiftly reacted and stepped out. When he reappeared, he was already standing before Jiang Tao.

Everyone in the surroundings took a cold breath when they saw Lin Yun’s speed. When Lin Yun pushed his palm out, his palm landed on Jiang Tao’s chest, forcing Jiang Tao to take several steps back.

“It has been ten moves,” said Lin Yun as he placed his hands behind his back.

This time, the rage on Jiang Tao’s face had reached the limit as he said, “You win.”

But just when he turned away, Lin Yun’s voice resounded behind him, “I said that it has been ten moves. Didn’t you hear me?”

Jiang Tao, who took several steps out, laughed when he heard what Lin Yun said. Turning around, he snickered, “Don’t tell me that you believed that I’d give you the Nine Profound Pellet? This saint pellet was prepared for me for the test. It has nothing to do with you.”

“You sure you want to mess with me?” Lin Yun said with a cold light flashing through his pupils.

“So what if I’m messing with you? What can a barbarian like you from the Profound Azure Prefecture do to me? When I become the disciple of a saint, you’ll see how I deal with you. What a ridiculous person.” Jiang Tao sneered. Jiang Tao flipped the table because he wasn’t afraid Lin Yun would dare to do anything to him.

This inn belonged to the Sword Sect, with multiple experts here. He didn’t believe that Lin Yun would dare to kill him. Instead, he hoped that Lin Yun would cause a huge fuss. It would be uncertain who would be killed at that time when everyone summons their constellations.

So Jiang Tao calmly looked at Lin Yun because he was confident that there was nothing Lin Yun could do to him. As he looked forward to making Lin Yun summon his constellation, he provoked Lin Yun further, “What’s the matter? You want to make a move against me?”

At that time, they could fight again when he brings out his entire cultivation at the Greater Elysium Core Realm.

“Well, I’m known for having a good temper.” Lin Yun smiled.

Jiang Tao’s eyes disdainfully flashed when he heard Lin Yun didn’t fall for it. But when he wanted to turn around and leave, he suddenly realized that he could no longer move. This instantly changed his face drastically as he raised his head to see Lin Yun smiling at him with the same expression.

This time, he was panicking because he could feel that his entire body was filled with Lin Yun’s sword intent; even his sky sword intent had been utterly suppressed. This was simply too terrifying because Jiang Tao had never experienced something like this before; his body wasn’t listening to him.

When Lin Yun stretched his hand out and tugged, he executed the Azure Dragon Grasp and pulled Jiang Tao over. When Jiang Tao appeared before Lin Yun, Lin Yun clenched his fist and punched Jiang Tao in the chest.

This punch made the astral energy enveloping Jiang Tao crumble with cracks appearing on his ribs and his internal organs shattering into pieces. This scene caused everyone to feel a chill down their spine with shock plastered on their faces.

Jiang Tao threw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying back. Lin Yun stopped him by holding onto his wrist. Despite the pain, Jiang Tao yelled, “No! No! No!”

When Lin Yun bent Jiang Tao’s arm to 90 degrees, this made Jiang Tao scream even louder from the pain. But that wasn’t all. Lin Yun then kicked Jiang Tao, easily shattering his left knee before repeating and doing the same for his right knee.

With both knees shattered, Jiang Tao weakly fell to his knees when Lin Yun dropped him. Jiang Tao’s face was pale, with his face distorted from the pain. Just when he wanted to circulate his astral energy to fly away, Lin Yun gave him a slap that made Jiang Tao slam to the ground. When Jiang Tao threw out a mouthful of blood, he spat out several broken teeth.

When Lin Yun gave Jiang Tao another slap, Jiang Tao threw out a mouthful of blood. This time, he even threw out the fragments of his internal organs.

Everyone was dumbfounded when they saw this scene and began to tremble in fear. They could feel their scalps going numb and couldn’t utter a single word. Everything took place in the blink of an eye, and the disciples of the Flowing Cloud Sect didn’t even have the time to react.

When they recovered from their shock, eight disciples of the Flowing Cloud Sect became furious, drawing their swords and charging toward Lin Yun. But just when they drew their swords out by half an inch, a sword ray accompanied by a cold breeze blew past.

Just like that, the eight fell to the ground and were nearly severed from their waist, with the ground dyed with their blood. This instantly made all the audience members tremble in fear, with their faces becoming pale. Turning their heads around, they saw Ye Ziling sheathing her sword. They immediately realized Lin Yun and Ye Ziling were demons, one more terrifying than the other.

“Young Master Lin, I’m wrong. P-Please spare my life!” Jiang Tao kneeled on the ground and was scared out of his wits.

“What are you saying? Didn’t I tell you I’m well-known for having a good temper? I’m not a killer,” smiled Lin Yun while he searched Jiang Tao. A brief moment later, his eyes lit up, “I’ve found it!”

He had found the box containing the Nine Profound Pellet. But this instantly made Jiang Tao anxious because that saint pellet was given to him by the Flowing Cloud Sect to use on the test. So he yelled, “My saint pellet! Return it to me!”

Toying with the box in his hand, Lin Yun said, “I might have a good temper, but I have no habit of giving back something that’s in my hands now.”

When he was done, he kicked Jiang Tao and sent him flying away like a ragdoll. This instantly left the remaining Flowing Cloud Sect’s disciples terrified as they ran for their lives with their blood flowing on the ground.

Everyone began to feel their scalps going numb. They then realized why the other disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect would look at Lin Yun with such weird gazes when he said he had a good temper.

“What are you guys looking at? Get lost!” Ye Ziling flared up, seeing that everyone was still standing there. They wanted to pay her visit so late at night? Who did they think she was?

Everyone nearly forgot that there was still a demoness, aside from Lin Yun. When they recollected, they quickly left the courtyard and didn’t dare to stay there for another moment. Aside from that, they were all wondering about the origin of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect for them to produce these two monsters, especially Flower Burial, who even crippled a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert.
