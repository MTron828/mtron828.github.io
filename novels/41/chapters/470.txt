Chapter 471 - Bloomphoenix Princess

Letting Xin Yan regain her surname and allowing the Ye Clan to regain their freedom. This might sound like two requests, but it wasn’t because Xin Yan was a member of the Ye Clan. But when Lin Yun said his request, the entire plaza instantly fell silent.

No one had expected that Lin Yun’s request would be so simple. After all, most people would make a request for themselves such as gaining power or resources. Many people might even use this opportunity to take revenge.

“This request is a little too simple. Are you sure about it?” asked the envoy.

“Yes,” replied Lin Yun.

“Okay. Emperor Qin, do you know what to do now?” The envoy’s words made everyone’s attention fall on Emperor Qin. After all, it was Emperor Qin who felt that Xin Yan’s father had too many achievements, which was the reason why he branded them as rebels. Although Xin Jue and Xin Yan were protected by the Sword Firmament Pavilion and weren’t reduced to slaves, the other members of the Ye Clan had become slaves and they were living a bitter life.

Xin Jue wanted to participate in the Dragon Gate Competition because he wanted the Ye Clan to regain their freedom. But now that task fell onto Lin Yun’s shoulders. Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t shrink from it.

But making Emperor Qin take back his words from ten years ago was the same as slapping his face, which was simply an embarrassment to an emperor. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Emperor Qin’s face was dark and his face slightly trembled. He was struggling in his heart to make a decision. A long time later, he closed up his eyes and seemed to have aged in that split second, “From today onwards, the Ye Clan will regain their freedom. They’re no longer slaves. Lord Envoy, you can be rest assured that I won’t go back on my word.”

His words made Xin Yan’s eyes red as she looked at the youth on the stage and smiled. Lin Yun had really done it. He defeated everyone and became the champion, ultimately saving the entire Ye Clan.

“Don’t go against your words. Otherwise, you know the consequences of breaking my trust. As for everyone’s rewards in the competition, it will be delivered to all seven of you three days later. Flying Feather died, but his slot won’t be filled,” said the envoy, which made Emperor Qin’s face turn ugly. Everyone else also found it a pity because they initially thought that there was a slot now that Qin Yu died.

At the same time, this meant that there were only seven titled figures in the empire for the next three years. Emperor Qin’s face was dark. Clearly, he couldn’t accept the results. He initially wanted to see Qin Yu become the champion, but he watched Qin Yu die before him instead. The rage he was feeling couldn’t be described.

Furthermore, he couldn’t vent his anger because of the envoy. After all, he had to go back against his own words and deem those rebels as innocent. When he walked past Bloomphoenix Princess, the princess looked forward without casting a glance at him.

“You’re just like your mother. You’re still not willing to forgive me…” smiled Emperor Qin bitterly. But this smile made his face look even more aged.

When everyone looked at Emperor Qin’s departing figure, they all felt that he seemed desolate. Everyone began to leave the moment Emperor Qin left, but when the other sects left, they all looked at Lin Yun deeply with a complicated gaze. They didn’t expect that Lin Yun would really become the champion.

However, for those who had a good relationship with Lin Yun, they went up to congratulate him. The last battle and the great reversal made many people cry. Looking at the surrounding people coming up to congratulate him, Lin Yun stayed calm. The strength of the few Heavenly Soul Realm cultivators had shocked him greatly.

Qin Yu was only ranked within the top five among Hua Yunxu’s disciples, but Lin Yun’s talent was at least stronger than Qin Yu’s. He was only eighteen and he had accomplished something that many people had only dreamt of.

“Congratulations, Sir Flower Burial. Let’s get together when we have time,” said Situ Yi as he came up with the Demonic Moon Villa’s party. He might’ve lost, but he didn’t hold a grudge against Lin Yun.

“Your martial Soul is fine, right?” asked Lin Yun.

“It will be fine after a few days. A phenomenon martial soul is stronger than you can imagine. Else, I wouldn’t have used it,” smiled Situ Yi.

“It’s really admirable how you stopped Qin Yu’s wedding by yourself and your sword,” said Aquaselenic as she looked at Xin Yan. Her gaze instantly made Xin Yan blushed. On the other hand, everyone from the Sword Firmament Pavilion all revealed a knowing smile.

Even Lin Yun revealed an embarrassed smile, but he didn’t follow up the topic. His gaze was on the princess. He seemed somewhat disappointed. After all, the princess didn’t come up to congratulate him now that the competition had come to an end.

After everyone left, Xin Yan spoke up, “Lin Yun, I want to go to the Sword Burial Woods to see my big brother.”

“Okay. Let’s go together. Lord Thirteen, you can come along with us.”

“You two can go ahead, I’ll be there shortly,” smiled Lord Thirteen as he stroked his beard.

Lin Yun nodded his head. He bade his farewell to Lord Thirteen and Jian Xuanhe before leaving for the Sword Burial Woods with Xin Yan on the Dragon Blooded Horse.

The Idlecloud Pavilion was bustling with people now that the competition had come to an end. People naturally came to collect their winnings. Naturally, Li Wuyou was among the crowd. But it was a pity that he didn’t win much. Everyone else had also miscalculated the ultimate underdog, Lin Yun. The only one who had been correct was Drifting Goblet.

He was like a prophet because he bet on Lin Yun becoming the champion with a third grade spiritual jade. The rate was 1:10, so he was paid his winnings. Everyone was sighing that they should’ve placed their bet the same way Drifting Goblet had. After all, betting 10,000 spiritual jades meant that they would receive 100,000 spiritual jades. Just thinking about it was insane.

Then again, there was no ‘if’ in the world. Only Drifting Goblet bet on Lin Yun becoming the champion. Drifting Goblet was drinking alone by himself on the third level since he had booked the entire level. He was drinking by himself as he stared out of the window, as if he was waiting for someone.

“You won quite a bit. I heard you bet a third grade spiritual jade on Lin Yun becoming the champion,” said the princess. If anyone was here, they would definitely be shocked.

With a faint smile, Drifting Goblet placed his cup down, “Shouldn’t you be the one who is happy? After all, how would he come this far if you didn’t get me to hand the entire Dragon-Tiger Fist to him?”

It was without a doubt that the Dragon-Tiger Fist was a great factor in Lin Yun becoming the champion. Without it, Lin Yun wouldn’t have risen so quickly in the sect. But this was also because Lin Yun was talented and hardworking. If he wasn’t talented enough, it was futile even if he had the Dragon-Tiger Fist.

“Perhaps.” The princess didn’t admit it or deny it, which made Drifting Goblet even more doubtful.

“I’ll ascend the throne half a month from now. I need you there to stop him if he comes,” said the princess. At this moment, she gave off an ethereal feeling. She was here, but she felt distant.

“Lin Yun too?”

“Yes,” said the princess.
