Chapter 1287 - Azure Dragon! (1)

“You demon!”

“You damned bastard! Are you disregarding us by showing up before us?!”

“Kill him!”

“It’s too easy to kill him. Let’s make him kneel here and beg for mercy!” The Flame Dragon Sect’s elites were furious and their faces cold. The hatred in their eyes was so deep that they hoped that they could tear Lin Yun apart right at this moment.

After all, what Lin Yun did was a huge blow to the big sects’ prestige, but there was nothing they could do to Lin Yun because he was somehow connected to the Radiant Sword Saint. Back then, Feng Jue merely used half an inch of sword ray to butcher eight Dragon Pulse Realm elders from the big sects. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But that wasn’t all. After they took a great blow to their prestige, the Samsara Edict Realm experts from their sects even had to give Lin Yun compensation. The humiliation was something that the Flame Dragon Sect had never suffered before.

“Sooo… you guys call me a demon just because you guys can’t do anything about me?” Lin Yun found it funny. After all, the big sects joined forces to set up the Nine Dragon Devouring Array, butchering countless geniuses and using them as nourishment for the Dragon Blood Fruit. But they called him a demon when their actions were more demonic?

“How can you be compared to us?”

“We’re from the big sects, all with ancient inheritances. How can we be compared to a lowly disciple from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect like you?”

“Why waste time with him? This demon is probably unlucky, seeing that he’s still in the Galaxy Stage.”

“Hahaha! He’s probably the God of Misfortune!”

“Your luck has come to an end. Kneel right now and I might consider giving you an easy death!” Lin Yun from before might be strong, but everything had changed on the Profound Wither Island. Without any hesitation, they released their auras as Elysium Core Realm experts to seal off all of Lin Yun’s paths of retreat with disdain written on their faces.

“I’m sorry, but I’m afraid you guys will have to be disappointed.” Lin Yun smiled. With a cold light flashing through his pupils, he suddenly moved. The Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples were shocked by Lin Yun’s speed, before two of them immediately made their move, trying to stop Lin Yun.

But alas, they were too slow. Or rather, Lin Yun was simply too fast. In just the blink of an eye, a palm mark had appeared on both of their faces, and they were both sent flying back along with a loud slap.

The two disciples could feel their minds buzzing from the dizziness. They still couldn’t fathom what just happened. After all, the both of them had reached the Elysium Core Realm, but they still couldn’t put up a fight with Lin Yun? This was simply too unbelievable.

Not to mention them, but the audience members who gathered around were also left dumbfounded. Just a moment ago, they were thinking that Lin Yun was a fool for provoking the Flame Dragon Sect. But the outcome had surprised them drastically and even caught them by surprise.

“Senior Brother, let me do it.” There was a youth standing beside Bai Luli. His face was pale, his hair was violently fluttering, and his eyes were filled with both hatred and anger.

“Mhm? You seem to look like a disciple from the Flame Dragon Sect that I’ve killed before.” Lin Yun said when he looked at that youth. This youth shared an uncanny resemblance with the genius from the Flame Dragon Sect back then who called others “mere ants”. That person wielded a stone tablet and the corpses of his victims had piled into a small mountain, intimidating countless Empyreans all by himself.

At that time, he even wanted to kill Lin Yun, only to be killed by Lin Yun instead and even had his stone tablet taken away. But the stone tablet needed the secret technique of the Flame Dragon Sect to activate, so it had no use in Lin Yun’s hand.

“That’s my third younger brother!” The youth had flames gushing out of his eyes before he yelled, “You bastard! You’ll be killed by others sooner or later for daring to kill the geniuses of the eight big sects!”

“Hmm… that totally sounds like a bad suggestion. How about this, I’ll kill you first!” Lin Yun replied. As a pair of golden wings unfolded behind him, he turned into a streak of golden light and charged toward the youth.

“You’re courting death!” The youth had completely lost it and retrieved a black spear. The spear was enveloped in flames as he charged at Lin Yun like a flaming dragon. That was the Jiao-Dragon Saint Spear, a saint artifact that only disciples of the Flame Dragon Sect could use.

This saint artifact was also famous in the Ancient Barren Domain because it was refined with the bones of jiao-dragons before being refined by the elder jiao-dragon in the Flame Dragon Sect. For a short period of time, it could even be comparable to monarch saint artifacts.

When that youth dashed forth with his spear, he was like a descending flaming meteor. But what happened next left everyone shocked. Lin Yun merely clenched his fist to resolve that youth’s attack before his punch flew out like an azure dragon and destroyed the spear.

In just the blink of an eye, the Jiao-Dragon Saint Spear was destroyed. When Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art, a thousand purple-golden dragon runes had appeared on the surface of his body with his hair fluttering wildly in the wind.

Under his attack, even the surrounding space had distorted from the violent thunderstorm energy, and one could imagine how terrifying Lin Yun’s attack was after reaching a thousand dragon runes.

But right at this moment, Bai Luli made his move. He grabbed onto the youth’s shoulder and left this place by turning into a streak of light. When Lin Yun’s attack missed, the purple-golden light exploded in mid-air and manifested into a violent thunderstorm that blew over the surrounding Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples.

All the Empyreans who were attracted to the scene were shocked by this because they never expected that Lin Yun, although he didn’t have any improvements in his cultivation, had become a lot stronger than when he competed for the Dragon Blood Fruit.

“H-How?” The faces of the Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples were especially shocked. Although Lin Yun didn’t seem to have any changes on the surface, he had refined a saint elixir before entering the Profound Wither Island. That was a genuine saint elixir, not to mention that his physique had been reforged and transformed to an innate saint physique.

That’s why, even if there wasn’t any change in his cultivation, he had undergone a thorough transformation in his strength, and it wasn’t something these people could imagine. He could only say that these people were too naive, thinking that they could crush him after reaching the Elysium Core Realm.

In the next second, Lin Yun appeared where Bai Luli stood, but he didn’t pursue the latter. He turned to the Ancient Spiritual Lake and circulated the Iris Sword Sutra. When he landed on the lake, a silver iris flower began to devour the water in the spiritual lake.

The water in the spiritual lake was the manifestation of the light that allowed elixirs to grow. The water crystallized, then acted like oil being ignited. As beams of light shot out from the spiritual lake, they then began to blaze like stars in the sky.

“Divine Astral Pellets!” This scene instantly left everyone dumbfounded. The beams of light that shot out from the Ancient Spiritual Lake were Divine Astral Pellets, and the sheer number was shocking. The Divine Astral Pellets were enveloped in flames, emitting a terrifying aura that made the density of the spiritual energy in the surroundings increase.

This also left Lin Yun shocked. When he focused his sword intent on his pupils, his eyes began to glow. His vision pierced through the mist and he could see an old man sitting at the bottom of the lake without any signs of life. He was sitting on a huge pile of Divine Astral Pellets. This meant that the Divine Astral Pellets have completely filled the bottom of the lake.

Looking at this scene, even Lin Yun couldn’t help inwardly cursing. This place was actually where an expert from the ancient era took his life breath, but Lin Yun had no idea if this old man was in seclusion or undergoing his tribulation when he died preparing so many Divine Astral Pellets. But even if he failed his tribulation and died, there were still so many Divine Astral Pellets left.

But there was something weird about this lake because the surroundings of the old man were surging with a destructive aura. When Lin Yun looked around, only then did he know what was going on. The waterfall that was filled with spiritual energy was pouring down; in reality, it was actually a seal on the entire lake. If the waterfall didn’t exist, then the corpse of the old man would’ve exploded a long time ago.

“Isn’t my luck a little too heaven-defying?” Lin Yun smiled before he raised his head.
