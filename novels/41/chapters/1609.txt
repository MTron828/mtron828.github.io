Chapter 1610 - Don’t Force Me!

Undoubtedly, the chief disciples of each powerful sect were strong. Their blade rays made the entire mountain tremble, and the two blade rays quickly tore the platform apart, and Lin Yun’s figure disappeared.

That was only a casual attack from Xuan Feng and Xiao Kui, but it was still terrifying to cause such destruction. This made everyone on the mountain stumped with their mouths wide open, and they finally knew what it was to be a genius of the Golden Generation.

“Nothing so impressive about the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, after all.” Xiao Kui sheathed his blade with disdain flashing across his pupils.

“He deserved it. A mere fly at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm dare to interfere in our affairs? It woud’ve been better if Gu Ruochen came.” Xuan Feng commented indifferently. They might not be friendly with each other, but they acknowledged each other’s strengths. Only Gu Ruochen was on the same level as them, and anyone else who dared to look at them alone was a sinner.

As the mountain trembled, the blade rays turned many corpses on the ground into ashes, and the commotion on the platform lasted for a long time.

“Aren’t you two a little too much?” A voice resounded from the cloud of dust, and a blurred silhouette gradually appeared before everyone. When Lin Yun waved his hand, a gale blew the cloud of dust away. The platform was messy, but it had all cleaned up when Lin Yun waved his hand.

When Lin Yun appeared before everyone unscathed, they saw the dragon runes that were glowing on the surface of his body, surprising Xuan Feng and Chen Tao. Their fellow disciples were also shocked because Lin Yun was actually fine under the attack of two pinnacle fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm experts. But how was this possible?

When everyone felt uncertain, Xuan Jian suddenly pushed his palm out, executing the Divine Monument Palm. When he was enveloped in a Buddhist light, a green monument appeared above him, and a gigantic palm descended from the sky.

Azure Dragon Grasp!

Lin Yun didn’t panic when facing the incoming attack. It’s as though he had already predicted it. As thunderstorms gathered, a dragon claw descended from the sky, destroying that gigantic palm before landing on Xuan Jian’s chest.

This made blood drip out of Xuan Jian’s lips as he took several steps back with shock reflected in his pupils. He was at the pinnacle of the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and his bones were comparable to saint artifacts. That attack still couldn’t injure his internal organs, and he only suffered some light injuries. But it made no sense because he shouldn’t be injured at all with the massive gap in their cultivations.

“You’re starting to get on my nerves.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly, and he drew his sword, executing the Heavenly Sword Form.

When Lin Yun executed the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, thirty-six figures appeared behind him, swinging out a sword, each like a layer of heaven.

As the thirty-six layers of heaven overlapped, a majestic sword ray flew out. This made Chen Tao, Xuan Feng, and Xiao Kui's faces change as they quickly moved.

When the attacks clashed, the three took a step back with their eyes squinting. The three exchanged a glance and couldn’t comprehend what was going on. He was clearly at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, which made no sense. Although they didn’t use their full strength, they were forced to take a step back against Lin Yun. This was simply too unbelievable.

The audience on the mountain was dumbfounded because they never expected Lin Yun to be able to make the three take a step back. Was the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple so terrifying?

“What are you guys doing? You guys aren’t going up, and yet you don’t let anyone else go up?” Lin Yun smiled, looking at the three with mockery in his eyes.

“Lin Yun, are you an idiot, or are you pretending to be one?” Xiao Kui said coldly. “You feel that you’re qualified to stand on the same level as us? Gu Ruochen is more likely to do that if he comes here!”

“Even if my senior brother was here, you wouldn’t have let him have the sword.” Lin Yun looked at Xiao Kui with a playful smile.

When he was done, Chen Tao from the Emerald Jade Manor finally made a move. But he didn’t make a move against Lin Yun, but dashed towards the wall. He activated his Glazed Treasure Physique along the way, and the deadly aura couldn’t threaten him.

“I’ll be taking a step, first!” Chen Tao smiled.

Lin Yun was a nobody. The Nether Saint Sword was of utmost importance.

“This bastard!” Xuan Feng and Xiao Kui cursed because Chen Tao took this opportunity to take the lead. They immediately ignored Lin Yun and chased after Chen Tao. They both knew Lin Yun offending them was nothing compared to a Sovereign Saint Sword. After they obtained the Sovereign Saint Sword, they would have plenty of time to deal with him.

After they moved, the disciples who came with them also charged over. Xuan Jian, who took a palm from Lin Yun, glared at the latter and said, “I’ll deal with you later. Cang Yun, you stay behind and watch him!”

He naturally couldn’t swallow it when he suffered in Lin Yun’s hand earlier.

Cang Yun was briefly stunned. When he came to his senses, Xuan Jian had already left him behind with Lin Yun. All the other disciples bolted towards the summit of the mountain. When Cang Yun turned his head, his pupils flashed with envy because there must be other treasures aside from the Sovereign Saint Sword. He didn’t dare to think about the Sovereign Saint Sword, but obtaining a saint artifact or saint pellets would be good.

“There’s no need to be envious. There might not be anything good on the summit.” Lin Yun said.

Cang Yun was unhappy and turned around, “What do you know? That’s a Sovereign Saint Sword! There must be other remains, and I might not have to risk my life in the Ancient Barren Battlefield anymore!”

“You really think so?” Lin Yun wore a profound smile.

“You’re really impressive. Not only did you become first on the Elysium Core Ranking, but you dared to face my senior brother head-on!” Cang Yun looked at Lin Yun with a playful gaze.

Glancing at him, Lin Yun turned to look at the mountain's summit.

“What did you mean by those words earlier?” Cang Yun was a chatterbox, so he started asking questions, seeing that Lin Yun wasn’t paying any attention to him.

“Haven’t you wondered why this mountain is a dead mountain? Since there must be remains at the summit, why can’t there be demonic corpses?” Lin Yun asked.

Those words made Cang Yun’s eyelid twitch. The Ancient Barren Battlefield might be dangerous, but demonic corpses were even more dangerous. They weren’t corpses corroded by demonic aura but fiends who turned into demonic corpses. They would have no chance if they ran into those demonic corpses.

“If there are demonic corpses, they should’ve come out earlier when the commotion was so huge.” Cang Yun’s lip twitched.

“The commotion earlier was huge, but no one touched that sword. But if someone touched that sword… haha.” Lin Yun sighed.

Cang Yun’s face changed, feeling that what Lin Yun said earlier made sense. But there was something that didn’t seem right, for some reason. A brief moment later, he asked, “Don’t try and fool me. If there are demonic corpses, why did you try to charge over earlier?”

“I don’t even fear your senior brother. So why would I be afraid of demonic corpses?” Lin Yun smiled.

After he said that, Cang Yun smiled, “You nearly fooled me. With my senior brother’s strength, what can the demonic corpses do to him?”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

But Lin Yun didn’t bother with Cang Yun and headed towards the wall. But when he took two steps out, Cang Yun appeared before him.

“Lin Yun, we might have some relationship, but you better not move since Senior Brother Xuan Jian told me to watch you.” Cang Yun smiled.

“Get out of my way. I don’t wish to make a move against you.” Lin Yun said. What he said was true since Lin Yun tricked Cang Yun back at Profound Wither Island. So he didn’t want to injure Cang Yun.

“Sorry about that.” Cang Yun shook his head.

“Your senior brother can’t stop me. Are you sure that you can stop me?” Lin Yun asked.

When Cang Yun heard that, his eyes flashed with sympathy, “Lin Yun, you’re too naive. My senior brother is stronger than you, but he wasn’t serious earlier. You should rejoice that you’re still alive. I’ll honestly tell you, the two of them possess a Glory Saint Artifact. It’s not an issue for them to kill you.”

Glory Saint Artifacts? Well, he also had two of them. So he didn’t bother with Cang Yun and continued forth. But when he took a step out, Cang Yun suddenly made a move with a dragon roar echoing from within his body.

The next moment, he was enveloped with a golden light as thunderstorms roared. Dragon runes began to appear on his body, and he was like an actual Azure Dragon at this moment, emitting a boundless draconic aura.

When his palm landed on Lin Yun, he was like an Azure Dragon that shoved Lin Yun away. When the huge force slammed over, Lin Yun was surprised and took three steps back before stabilizing himself. When he raised his head, Cang Yun’s dragon runes gathered and formed an Azure Dragon.

“You succeeded?” Lin Yun was surprised.

“You’re not the only one in this world who’s a genius. I already said that we might have some relationship, so don’t make it hard. You might have been able to suppress me on the Profound Wither Island and the Heavenly Pool Gathering, but that was the past. You’re no longer my opponent.” Cang Yun said.

Lin Yun examined Cang Yun and noticed his dragon runes were purer than when he obtained the Blue Dragon Bone. His azure dragon aura was also genuine. He initially planned to trick Cang Yun by giving him the Azure Dragon Saint Art because this required a strong talent in body-refining techniques and a dragon bone. So he thought that even if Cang Yun had the Azure Dragon Saint Art, it would be hard for him to practice it. But since Cang Yun succeeded, Lin Yun no longer had any reservations about making a move against Cang Yun.

“You’re a genius!” Lin Yun smiled.

“Likewise, likewise.” Cang Yun smiled. “You’re not bad yourself, and I have a deep impression of when you defeated Huang Xuanyi back at the Heavenly Pool Gathering. But you better go back now. Don’t force me because it’ll sound bad if the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple kneels before me.”

Four dragon pulses appeared behind Cang Yun as he circulated his dragon origin. As the aura of the dragon pulses combined with the azure dragon aura, he slowly walked toward Lin Yun. He was planning to intimidate Lin Yun with his aura.
