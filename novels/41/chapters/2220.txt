Chapter 2221 - Here Comes A Big One (2)

Over the past three days, he suffered a lot of grievances. He didn’t dare to take revenge against his mistress but didn’t hesitate to take revenge against Ye Guhan. Furthermore, he suspected his senior brother was enjoying this, taking revenge on him by using training as a disguise.

“Not bad, Junior Brother. You have a meticulous heart.” Ye Guhan struggled to face off against this, but didn’t spare Lin Yun with his mouth. He praised Lin Yun for having a meticulous heart, but it sounded like an insult in Lin Yun’s ears, making him grit his teeth.

As for Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, she hovered in the air and nodded her head lightly when she saw this scene.

Even Lin Yun didn’t notice that his Astral Sword Intent, which hadn’t improved for a long time, was undergoing a form of fusion. His sword technique had reached a height that even Ye Guhan couldn’t neglect. It’s just that Lin Yun still hadn’t realized it.

Lin Yun performed the Heaven Sword Form and Moon Reflection Mirror with a roar. As the two sword techniques began to fuse, the two sword canons overlapped, distorting between illusory and reality.

But it was fortunate that his saint aura was sealed. Otherwise, the power of this sword if Lin Yun could manipulate the surrounding spiritual energy with the two sword sutras would be immense.

“It has come to an end now! Go down, Ye Guhan!” Lin Yun unleashed all his suppressed emotions after having waited for this moment for a long time, wanting to send Ye Guhan down the mountain.

In the past, Ye Guhan would have come forth to ‘comfort’ him whenever he said he couldn’t hold on any longer, which was to give him a beating before kicking him down the mountain. As a result, Lin Yun had waited for this moment after so long.

Ye Guhan’s paths were sealed off. But even after being restrained by Lin Yun’s sword intent, Ye Guhan didn’t panic as he smiled, “No bad. As expected of my beloved junior brother.”

This immediately gave Lin Yun a bad feeling that something wasn’t right.

“But it’s a pity that I’m the protagonist from five hundred years ago!” Ye Guhan laughed as his hair fluttered in the wind, looking arrogant as his face radiated.

“Dao!” Ye Guhan roared as his sword danced, unleashing eighty-one swords with a flick of his wrist. When the eighty-one swords bloomed, they looked like a dao flower and a dazzling star.

Lin Yun’s attacks were shattered as ripples spread out with holes appearing. He wiped the blood off his lips, and he retreated to ten meters away before he managed to stabilize his footing. He muttered to himself with shock, “How is this possible?!”

He was sure that his senior brother couldn’t use a higher cultivation than him nor his saint aura. At best, he could only absorb spiritual energy from the surrounding atmosphere. But Ye Guhan’s attack shattered his attack, and this defeat was too sudden because it meant that all his effort for the past few days had gone down the drain.

“This is the first sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword’s third section, Blooming Stars,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“You cheated!” Lin Yun was furious.

But Ye Guhan didn’t seem bothered, and smiled, “You can only blame yourself for not knowing it. Your senior brother is a genius, so you can go back down now!”

Before Lin Yun could make a move, Ye Guhan ruthlessly punched Lin Yun, sending him rolling down the mountain like a snowball.

Listening to Lin Yun’s screams, Ye Guhan complained, “That brat is getting harder and harder to deal with. It has only been three days.”

“It’s hard not to improve with a senior brother like you. If he didn’t improve, he might have already died,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

Ye Guhan shamelessly accepted this ‘praise.’ He chewed on a Divine Dragon Fruit and smiled, “That’s for sure. After all, this is my love as a senior brother!”

“Improving too quickly might not be good. He has a long endurance and needs a big one,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“Don’t worry, leave it to me. A big one will be coming soon,” Ye Guhan smiled.

Another four days later, Lin Yun easily fought Ye Guhan and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and he didn’t fall into a disadvantageous position even after fifty moves. He would only lose after a hundred moves. This was a terrifying improvement. Who could have imagined that Lin Yun couldn’t stand firmly seven days ago?

After seven days, not only could he stand, but he could even exchange a hundred moves with them.

“Let’s go to the new segment of the regimen,” Lin Yun smiled as he sheathed his sword.

Ye Guhan and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint exchanged glances. They knew what Lin Yun was thinking about. The Serene Dust Great Saint was the last, and she doted on Lin Yun the most, which Lin Yun also knew about.

Looking at Lin Yun’s state, he clearly still had strength and was probably looking forward to changing to the Serene Dust Great Saint.

Ye Guhan smiled, “Junior Brother, you once asked me what’s above Astral, right?”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, and asked, “What is it?”

“Do you still want to change to the next segment of the regimen?” Ye Guhan asked.

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled, then said, “There’s no need to hurry.”

“I’ll tell you about it, it’s Divine Light!” Ye Guhan said, “Divine Light is the natural essence of the eyes in nature. Divine light is a powerful sword intent with a looming light that can travel across a thousand miles like the wind.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that.

“Your Astral Sword Intent was stuck for a long time, right? You are already reaching the Divine Light Sword Intent threshold, only a step away from reaching the Quasi-Divine Light,” Ye Guhan said.

“Senior Brother, teach me!” Lin Yun quickly said.

“Not going to call me by my name anymore?” Ye Guhan asked with a playful smile.

“Senior Brother, you must be joking. You are and always will be my senior brother!” Lin Yun replied.

“You don’t want to go to the next segment of the regimen anymore?” Ye Guhan smiled.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“There’s no need to hurry, no need to hurry,” Lin Yun said.

“Alright, I’ll stop teasing you anymore. After all, you’re my beloved junior brother, so why would I be angry with you? Come,” Ye Guhan smiled. He led Lin Yun to a cliff with an abyss down below.

“It’ll be almost done once you jump down,” Ye Guhan said.

“T-This is dangerous,” Lin Yun awkwardly smiled. His Azure Dragon Divine Physique was still sealed, but it’ll soon be a full seven days. So he didn’t want to take any risk before then.

“Come, Senior Brother will jump with you,” Ye Guhan said.

Lin Yun looked down at the abyss because there was a terrifying aura down below. If he jumped down, the ten times gravity might tear him into pieces. He would be killed in mid-air and heavily injured even if he wasn’t dead.

“Not even if I will jump with you?” Ye Guhan asked.

Lin Yun shook his head, and said, “Not unless you jump first.”

But when Lin Yun said that, he immediately regretted it and wanted to slap himself.

“Hahaha! Good!” Ye Guhan laughed and turned to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, “Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, you hear that? If this brat doesn’t jump, you can just force him down.”

Lin Yun turned to look at the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, who was also looking at him. This made him feel a chill, but it was too late to regret it.

Ye Guhan didn’t hesitate to jump, and this shocked Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun hadn’t prepared himself for it yet, and he could see the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint taking a few steps when he turned around.

This made Lin Yun wear a bitter smile as he gritted his teeth and jumped down.

As wind poured into his hair, Lin Yun could see Ye Guhan’s figure, but the latter soon disappeared as if he had teleported. Seeing this, Lin Yun cursed inwardly because he knew he was tricked by Ye Guhan again.

But before he could do anything, gravity pulled him down, and he felt his life was on the line with his body being stretched out. Logically speaking, the Firmament Saint Cloth could save his life, but he could only use it if he faced an opponent with a cultivation much higher than his own. This meant the Firmament Saint Cloth wouldn’t care about him if he committed suicide.

Lin Yun felt a chill run down his spine; he had never felt so close to death. His soul was nearly ripped apart, and his thoughts froze under the pain.

His instincts to live made him circulate his sword intent to the limit to resist the force coming from the surroundings, but Lin Yun didn’t know where his limit was.

As the sun and moon began to fuse, a golden radiance shone from Lin Yun’s eyes that looked as though Lin Yun had double pupils. Just when Lin Yun’s body was about to collapse, a powerful sword intent spread out that resisted the force coming from the surroundings due to gravity.

“It’s a success!” Lin Yun rejoiced. But before he could smile, he fell onto the ground, which made him grimace in pain. This pain was ten times more painful than falling down the mountain.

When he struggled to get back, he raised his head and saw Ye Guhan seated on a huge rock, chewing on the Divine Dragon Fruit.

“Ye Guhan, you tricked me!” Lin Yun was furious as he stomped towards Ye Guhan.

“Oh, I nearly forgot that I have grasped the Space Dao.” Ye Guhan smiled with his eyes squinted, and his bright smile felt as though it could melt ice. He continued, “Don’t forget that your senior brother is a genius!”
