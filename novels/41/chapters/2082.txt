Chapter 2083: Kill

Facing the Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saint’s assault, Lin Yun wielded the White Dragon Sword and swung it with a reverse grip. A sword ray was released from the White Dragon Sword in the shape of a crescent moon, stirring the surrounding spiritual energy before forming into a violent tornado of sword rays.

The wind was filled with Netherflower petals, and the tornado formed into a blade that contained death and destruction. When the petals rained down, the palm began to dissipate.

“Again!” Lin Yun stood with his sword. In his hand, the White Dragon Sword looked like it had broken free from all shackles, turning into a divine dragon. He didn’t care if his unleashed sword ray was destroyed as he dashed forth. When sword rays rained from the sky, this made Lin Yun look like an immortal.

When the sword rays dashed forth with an incredible speed, they struck the saint aura around the Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saint under the latter’s shocked gaze. The sword ray easily tore apart that Quasi-Saint’s saint aura and his blood began to gush out from his wound.

“H-How is this possible…” The Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saint threw out blood. He couldn’t believe he couldn’t even block an attack with his two hundred years of cultivation. Most importantly, the nether energy within the sword ray had penetrated his body, wreaking havoc. As the Quasi-Saint threw out another mouthful of blood, he had lost his fighting prowess.

“Excellent sword!” Lin Yun’s eyes shone as he looked at the sword in his hand. The sword shimmered flawlessly and reflected his appearance, with his hair fluttering in the air, making him look handsome. He was surprised he could control the energy that snapped all the swords in the past after the ‘broken sword’ within his body was drawn out by another inch. This was a pleasant surprise, solving a problem that had been bothering him for years.

“What a powerful sword aura. Just how terrifying is his attainment in the sword had to be able to cut through the azure saint aura so easily?”

“It’s unbelievable someone at the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage can exhibit the power of sword intent to this extent.”

“He seems to be stronger than when he fought Feng Shaoyu!” The surrounding geniuses noticed that Ye Qingtian had held back during his fight with Feng Shaoyu.

“Holy shit, his nether energy is about to surpass mine…” Mu Chuan couldn’t help smiling when he saw this scene. He knew that as long as Lin Yun lived, the Sword Sect would rise in the future, and he wouldn’t let the tragedy repeat itself.

“Sword Sect’s disciples, charge! Show these people not to underestimate the Eastern Desolation!”

““Roger!””

Ye Qingtian’s performance greatly boosted everyone’s morale, allowing them to surpass themselves.

“Holy shit. The Sword Sect is really strong. I remembered that they’re not even a holy land, right?”

“Do you think the strongest sword dao sect within the Eastern Desolation is a fluke? If Flower Burial was still within the sect, I’m afraid that the Sword Sect would be even stronger now.”

“See that Quasi-Saint who’s facing two enemies? That’s the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, Mu Chuan. Ordinary Quasi-Saints aren’t his opponent at all.”

“They have no fear at all. They’ve fully displayed the grace of a swordsman, just the fact that they dare to stand out for the Heavenly Dao Sect. I bet being in such a sect must make them happy.”

Everyone was shocked by the Sword Sect’s morale. The Black Plume Palace also never expected this event to take a different turn because of the Sword Sect.

“Damn it! Don’t care about everyone else, just kill him first!” An Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saint elder of the Black Plume Palace anxiously said.

Four Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints immediately charged at Lin Yun. Mu Chuan and the Indigo Thunder Peak Master were strong, but there were too many people from the Black Plume Palace.

Far away, Jiang Yunting and Gu Zijing initially intended to help. But they were shocked after seeing Ye Qingtian inflicting heavy injuries on an Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saint with one strike. An Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saint had fallen so easily, which was too unbelievable.

When Lin Yun finished his previous fight and saw the four incoming Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints, he roared, “It looks like the Black Plume Palace is lacking to dispatch mere Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints to fight me!”

“You’re courting death!”

“What arrogance!”

“Ye Qingtian, today is your doomsday!” The four Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints immediately became furious, releasing their two hundred years of cultivation. They might not have comprehended saint dao, but they could easily crush geniuses at the Azure Origin Phase. Not to mention the four of them were joining forces together. So when they were being looked down upon, they immediately unleashed their strongest attacks, summoning their constellations.

““Black Plume Asura Slash!”” The four executed the same technique as black wings enveloped in demonic flames appeared behind them.

“Myriad Swords Unite!” Lin Yun was never a person that stuck to the rules when making a move. With a glance, anyone could tell he was trying to resolve the incoming attack with the lowest cost. He didn’t execute the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword as everyone had imagined. He only dashed forth with the Myriad Swords Unite.

As thirteen figures performed a sword technique, sword rays flew out, and each sword took on a tricky trajectory with terrifying sword intent. Two of the Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints’ arms were severed as they screamed out in pain.

“Retreat!” The four Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints were frightened by this scene as they retreated. But as the thirteen figures overlapped, Lin Yun’s sword pierced through the hearts of the two Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints who had their arms severed.

This was a shocking scene as the two were severed into two. This scene left Gu Zijing and Jiang Yunting numb, and they had no idea how to express their feelings. Ye Qingtian, who was engaged in a deathmatch, was scary. After all, there were rules in the Sword Assembly, and Ye Qingtian wasn’t a bloodthirsty person. But when Ye Qingtian revealed his murderous intent, he looked like a fiendgod from hell.

“Holy shit. Ye Qingtian’s name will spread throughout the Kunlun Realm in the future.”

“If he can reach the Quasi-Saint Realm before the Blue Dragon Record appears, he will surely have a spot on it, and no holy son can outshine him.”

“But he’s a little late. If he appeared earlier, the champions of the nine Heavenly Paths might not have their current reputation.”

“Don’t be so sure about that. The champions of the Heavenly Paths are terrifying, and you have never seen how terrifying they are.”

“That’s right. But Ye Qingtian’s talent in the sword is unrivaled!” Discussions resounded from the surroundings. Everyone initially thought it would be a one-sided battle, but the table was reversed, and they finally realized how terrifying Ye Qingtian was.

“Withered Tree Coming To Life!”

“Rising Sun!”

“Polar Opposite!”

“Flaming Floral Silver Tree!”

Lin Yun swiftly caught up with the remaining two and executed the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword. The two Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saint elders were retreating as their injuries increased.

Realizing they weren’t Ye Qingtian’s opponent, a Black Plume Palace’s Quasi-Saint elder took out a crimson halo as his facial expression became sinister.

“That’s the Demonic Saint Blood Halo!”

“Isn’t that a hidden weapon from the Demon Gate? Isn’t the Black Plume Palace too despicable to allow a Quasi-Saint to use that against someone at the Nirvana Stage?”

“Even a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase might not withstand the Demonic Saint Blood Halo’s explosion. It looks like Ye Qingtian is in danger,” Many people’s faces changed when they saw the crimson halo.

“Die!” That Quasi-Saint’s face was sinister as he poured his saint aura into the halo and threw it in Lin Yun’s direction. The halo immediately created a crimson cloud that rose to the sky with terrifying demonic flames and an exploding saint aura.

Lin Yun quickly responded by retreating, but he was caught in the explosion and retreated far away.

“Ye Qingtian!” The faces of Ye Ziling and others changed.

Mu Chuan and the Indigo Thunder Peak Master’s faces changed when they saw this scene.

As a dazzling golden radiance exploded, Lin Yun returned to where he stood and asked, “Is that all you’ve got?”

“What’s going on? Why isn’t he injured?”

“How is this possible? The Demonic Saint Blood Halo was forged with the blood of Saint Realm demonic beasts, demonic flames, and hundreds of poisons. How can he possibly come out unscathed? This makes no sense!” The elder who used the Demonic Saint Blood Halo was stumped with disbelief on his face. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Throw them all out!” Another Quasi-Saint’s eyes flashed with a ruthless light. The Demonic Saint Blood Halo was extremely precious, but they couldn’t be bothered about that now. They threw out three Demonic Saint Blood Halos, which enveloped a hundred miles in radius. This time, Lin Yun couldn’t avoid the explosions.

Amidst the explosions, Lin Yun executed the Divine Sunchasing Art with different colored radiances shining on him.

The sun and moon sword stars combined, forming a perfect barrier that blocked 70% of the explosion. As a result, the remaining aftermath of the explosion couldn’t inflict any injuries on Lin Yun, who possessed the Blue Dragon Bone.

“Die!” Lin Yun dashed out of the demonic radiance with an echoing dragon’s roar. The two Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints couldn’t escape even if they wanted to. It was already too late as their heads flew away.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and raised his head to look at the distant Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints. They were trembling in fear and didn’t dare to get close.

Mu Chuan and the Indigo Thunder Peak Master held back most Quasi-Saints at the Indigo and Heavenly Origin phases. Even their safety couldn’t be ensured, not to mention reinforcing them.

“How is this possible?!” The Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saint beside Zhao Wuji was dumbfounded because this completely differed from their plans.

Those from the Misty Rain Manor, Soaring Cloud Sect, and Aquamoon Sword Mountain were dumbfounded. They were initially here to kick the dog while it was down, but they were terrified by the strength Ye Qingtian had displayed. Not to even mention helping, they didn’t even dare to stay there any longer.

“Ye Ziling, you can have your sword back!” Lin Yun smiled at Ye Ziling and threw the White Dragon Sword back. The White Dragon Sword was excellent, but Lin Yun liked his Flower Burial Sword the most.

Lin Yun drew his sword and stroked the sword as though he was looking at his lover.

“It’s really him…” Ye Ziling muttered as she caught the White Dragon Sword.

When Lin Yun raised his head, his murderous intent suddenly caused the surrounding temperature to fall.

“What is he trying to do?” Gu Zijing and Jiang Yunting were shocked by the murderous aura that Ye Qingtian gave off. When they raised their heads to look at Ye Qingtian, they took a deep breath because Ye Qingtian wanted to kill Zhao Wuji.
