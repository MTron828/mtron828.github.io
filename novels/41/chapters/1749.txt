Chapter 1750 – Healing Injuries

“Go on.” The pavilion master smiled. His attitude towards Lin Yun was great. He already knew Lin Yun possessed the Wind God Order, and the Nirvana Banquet was a test for him, which Lin Yun gave a perfect answer to his test.

“I’ll not be going to the Dual Moon Lake tomorrow.” Lin Yun said.

“Why not?” The pavilion master was surprised. He furrowed his brows and asked, “You’re leaving?”

He was a little anxious and couldn’t understand why Lin Yun wanted to immediately leave after becoming first on the Nirvana Banquet. Didn’t he know what the Wind God Order signified? Before Lin Yun could reply, he secretly transmitted his voice, “Young friend, do you mind staying a few more days? I should have something that interests you.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned when he heard the transmission, and he instantly understood what the pavilion master meant. He briefly hesitated and looked at the pavilion master in shock. He was wondering what the pavilion master was trying to hint at, but he wasn’t going to leave. He just didn’t want to go to the Dual Moon Lake and wanted to take care of Yue Weiwei.

“The scenery in the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion is beautiful, and I’m not in a hurry to leave. But the Profound Fairy is injured, and I wish to care for her tomorrow.” Lin Yun said.

When Yue Weiwei heard what Lin Yun said, she could feel warmth in her heart, and a gentle smile rose on her lips. This time, everyone’s impression of Lin Yun changed because of his devotion. He could be furious over his woman and even give up the opportunity to play before Three-Lives Tree for her.

“I see…” The pavilion master smiled, and he turned to look at Yan Tianchen. “Okay. But don’t refuse, Young Brother Yan.”

Yan Tianchen naturally nodded his head. He was pretty interested in the Dual Moon Lake. Furthermore, there was a chance he could obtain the Three-Lives Fruit, even if the odds were low.

“We’ll meet again tomorrow, then.” The pavilion master smiled before leaving. After he left, everyone also left, but they were filled with anticipation for the Dual Moon Lake.

When Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei were about to leave, two figures suddenly rushed over. They both wore smiles on their faces, and Lin Yun naturally recognized them. They were Ye Chen and Liu Ruochen, geniuses of the Divine Phoenix Mountain and Heavenly Dao Sect. They were both experts on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, and their cultivation wasn’t inferior to Li Yuxi. In terms of music dao alone, their attainment was even higher than the latter.

“Brother Lin, please hold on.” They both approached with smiles and greeted Yue Weiwei.

Lin Yun nodded his head in response. They might be holy land geniuses, but they had no grudges. They did not stand on Qin Hao’s side at the banquet last night, so he responded in kind. He wouldn’t offend others if he wasn’t offended and would return respect with respect.

“Big Brother Lin, what plans do you have after the Nirvana Banquet?” Liu Ruochen asked first. He smiled, “Why don’t you visit the Heavenly Dao Sect? You’re a swordsman. The Heavenly Dao Sect might not be a sect that mainly focuses on the sword, but we’re the strongest with the sword in the Eastern Desolation.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help finding those words irritating as the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. But he didn’t say anything about it because Liu Ruochen clearly meant no hostility, and he wasn’t exactly wrong, either. The Sword Sect was the strongest with the sword in the Ancient Barren Domain, but the Heavenly Dao Sect was undoubtedly the strongest holy land in the Eastern Desolation. This naturally meant their foundation in the sword was stronger than the Sword Sect’s.

The Heavenly Dao Sect also had two famous swords, the Heaven Sword and Dao Sword. Those two swords were Sovereign Saint Artifacts, and there were rumors that they could be comparable to a divine artifact when they combined.

“Brother Liu, you’re already starting to poach him?” The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Ye Chen smiled. “It doesn’t look nice before the Profound Fairy.”

“The Profound Fairy can also come to play. Speaking of which, the Heavenly Dao Sect also has a sword saint, and this person is the heir of the Radiant Sword Saint.” Liu Ruochen smiled.

Lin Yun knew that the person Liu Ruochen was talking about was his senior brother.

“Okay, I will visit the Heavenly Dao Sect when I’m free.” Lin Yun replied. He would naturally go to the Heavenly Dao Sect, but it was uncertain which identity he would go with. But since Liu Ruochen invited him, this might be an opportunity for him.

“Are you serious?” Liu Ruochen asked in disbelief.

“What attitude is that? Were you joking with your invitation earlier?” Yue Weiwei smiled.

Liu Ruochen waved his hand, and he smiled, “Hahaha. I’m not joking. But I didn’t expect Brother Lin to agree so decisively. Alright, that’s a promise, then!”

Hearing that, Ye Chen became anxious and said, “Don’t! Brother Lin, why don’t you visit the Divine Phoenix Mountain, instead? I’ll not keep it from you. I’m under the orders of our elders. The Divine Phoenix Touch has reappeared, and we’d like to invite Brother Lin to the Divine Phoenix Mountain. You don’t have to worry. You’re from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, so we won’t make it hard for you.”

He even explained, fearing that Lin Yun might misunderstand. Lin Yun had no idea what he was trying to say, but they probably wanted to use something to exchange for the Divine Phoenix Touch. The Divine Phoenix Mountain was a powerful holy land that might be related to Lil’ Purple’s origin. So it was fine for him to make a trip over.

He didn’t mind handing the Divine Phoenix Touch over if he could receive corresponding resources. He had to face Tian Xuanzi, and the Divine Phoenix Mountain might be able to help him. So there was no harm in making more friends.

“Sure. You can get the elder of the Divine Phoenix Mountain to speak with me.” Lin Yun replied.

Ye Chen was shocked to see how nice Lin Yun was. He smiled, “Hahaha. That’s great. I’ll be able to have an answer now.”

“Oh, right. Brother Lin, are you really not going to Dual Moon Lake tomorrow? The Three-Lives Tree is an ancient tree from ancient times, and it likes to listen to music. Playing music before the Three-Lives Tree can be a reward for those in the top ten. So the losses are great if you give up on it…” Liu Ruochen said.

Nodding his head, Ye Chen said, “It’s normally hard to see the Three-Lives Tree. I heard that someone from the Ten Musician Clans might come tomorrow.”

Lin Yun had heard of the Ten Musician Clans before the Nirvana Banquet began. But because they were nowhere to be seen throughout the Nirvana Banquet, he practically forgot about them. He asked, “Why didn’t they come to the Nirvana Banquet and only come when it has ended?”

“I’m not sure about that. Perhaps they were disdainful about interacting with us. But that was only what I heard, and I’m not sure if they will really show up.” Ye Chen smiled. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Nodding his head, Lin Yun replied, “I’m not interested in them. We can talk about what we discussed earlier further after tomorrow, then.”

“Okay!” Ye Chen and Liu Ruochen cupped their hands before leaving. They had gotten the answers they wanted, so there was no reason for them to keep Lin Yun around any longer.

“What do you think?” Ye Chen asked, looking at Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei’s silhouettes.

Liu Ruochen naturally knew what he wanted to ask and replied, “He’s friendlier than I’ve expected. I thought it would be tough to interact with him, due to his arrogant performance, but I never expected it to be so easy.”

Nodding his head, Ye Chen smiled, “That’s what I feel as well, and I can’t believe how easy it is to talk to him. He’s arrogant with Li Yuxi, but he’s actually so courteous with us.”

“Now that we looked at it again, Li Yuxi is a laughingstock. Lin Yun does have the capability not to submit to them.” Liu Ruochen said.

“First on the Nirvana Banquet; he’s fully worthy of it.” Ye Chen sighed, fully convinced of Lin Yun’s achievements.

When they returned to the courtyard assigned to them by the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion, Lin Yun examined Yue Weiwei’s injuries before furrowing his brows. He realized that her injuries were more severe than he had imagined. At the same time, he could sense a great power sealed within her body. She had probably used this power when she fought Hua Hongyu.

The aura of this power was massive and ancient. When Lin Yun briefly examined it, he could sense a faint threat directed at him.

“This is what my mother left for me, the inheritance of the Heavenly Fox’s lineage. The Heavenly Fox is a powerful existence, even amongst all the foxes. Only a Heavenly Fox with nine tails can receive the Nine-Tailed Heavenly Fox’s inheritance, and I can start inheriting it upon reaching the Samsara Edict Realm.” Yue Weiwei said. She didn’t bother concealing it.

“Let me treat your injuries, first. Don’t be so silly in the future.” Lin Yun replied.

“Okay.” Yue Weiwei smiled. She didn’t give a direct reply to his request.

They placed their hands together while sitting face-to-face. Lin Yun then started pouring the boundless vitality from his Blue Dragon Bone over to Yue Weiwei. Not only could it treat all sorts of injuries, but it could also resolve all poisons.

Four hours later, Yue Weiwei’s face became rosy once more. With the help of the Blue Dragon Bone, she completely recovered from her injuries. But Lin Yun still wasn’t relieved, and he even left a blue spiritual light within her body.

But because of the great exhaustion in her mental energy, she was exhausted even after recovering from her injuries and fell asleep in Lin Yun’s embrace. After Lin Yun played a song for her, he took out the Three-Lives Fruit.

Becoming first on the Nirvana Banquet, the greatest reward was this Three-Lives Fruit. The other treasures might be priceless, but they didn’t have many temptations for him. This fruit could give the consumer a year to ten years of extra time, and Lin Yun needed time the most. He couldn’t imagine how terrifying his cultivation would become if he could get an additional ten years. Even if he only had one year, it was a godsend.

“A year to ten years, the uncertainty is too great.” Lin Yun briefly pondered and knew he had to ask the pavilion master about it to see how he could bring out the greatest effect of the Three-Lives Fruit. What the pavilion master secretly said to him should be hinting about the Wind God Order. This confirmed that the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion was related to the Azure Dragon’s lineage, and this instantly made him uncertain because he didn’t know how to face them.

He was too weak to face the entire Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion. If they wanted to forcefully seize the Wind God Order and kill him, there was nothing he could do. So perhaps he would have to rely on Mu Xueling to help him.

Lin Yun long discovered that Mu Xueling showed no respect even when facing the pavilion master. But whenever he thought about Mu Xueling, he would recall how he saw her face on the Dual Moon Lake. That night, four people appeared on the Dual Moon Lake. They were Ye Xinyan, Su Ziyao, An Liuyan, and Mu Xueling. But Lin Yun couldn’t figure out why Mu Xueling would appear.

As dawn gradually arrived under his thoughts, many people rushed towards the Dual Moon Lake when the first sunlight shone down.

Yue Weiwei slowly woke up and rubbed her eyes. She asked, “Big Brother Lin, are you really not going to the Dual Moon Lake?”

Lin Yun shook his head and told Yue Weiwei what the pavilion master said when he secretly transmitted his voice.

Yue Weiwei blinked her eyes and said, “We have to discuss this with Senior Sister. Tell her about it. I believe she will agree to it.”

“Together.” Lin Yun said.

Yue Weiwei sent a doubtful look towards Lin Yun when she heard that before replying, “Let’s go, then.”
