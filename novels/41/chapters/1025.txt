Chapter 1026 - Massacre

“It’s you!”

“The imbecile really dared to appear!” The faces of the War Realms’ geniuses changed. They had clearly laid a trap for Lin Yun, so no one thought he would appear.

Everyone began to wonder if Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of death. As for the geniuses beneath the altar, they were shocked and excited. After all, Lin Yun had forged a legend for himself by killing many geniuses in the Yellow Sandy Plain.

Lin Yun had proved that the war realms were nothing in his eyes. As an ant from the lower realms, he had become many people’s hero. Everyone was looking at Lin Yun emotionally because they didn’t want him to fail.

“Damn it! These bastards were waiting for him!”

“This was a trap!”

“He shouldn’t have come. There’s no way he can last long against the war realms! These bastards are too much!” Tears started to form in the eyes of the crowd as they looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun merely looked at the war realms with boundless killing intent in his eyes. He was hellbent on starting a massacre. However, he wouldn’t let his rage get the best of him. He calmly assessed the situation and noticed something unusual about the altar and its statue.

“Flower Burial, you shouldn’t have shown up…” The youth said in a painful voice when Lin Yun helped him up. It was the youth that was suppressed by the Black Dragon Ruler.

“Get some rest,” said Lin Yun before gently pushing him back into the crowd.

“You should have come for me. Why did you have to involve the innocent?” Lin Yun glanced at the Elysium Trigram War Realm’s genius who was called a monkey.

“They’re just a bunch of ants that provoked me. I’m benevolent, so I only taught them a small lesson,” smiled the Elysium Trigram War Realm’s genius. Lin Yun had a treasure that could change the final ranking and his appearance had caused everyone on the altar to become excited. They weren’t afraid of Lin Yun even though he killed many people.

When the Elysium Trigram War Realm’s genius looked at Lin Yun, he grinned and licked his lips with excitement. Even the golden-clothed youth had greed flickering in his pupils.

Benevolent? Lin Yun looked at those who were kneeling on the ground covered in injuries. They were humiliated just because they wanted to exercise their right to go to Four Phase City.

“Lin Yun, do you admit your crime?” Roared a genius from the Nether Divinity War Realm. He was donned in Blacklight Battle Armor. He had a vertical rune on his forehead with flames that blazed in his eyes.

“Oh? What crime is that?” Lin Yun asked indifferently.

“It’s a crime for a lowly ant like you to have the Azure Dragon True Bone, not to mention that you injured the Profound Lightning Twin Swords and killed eight people from my Nether Divinity War Realm!” Roared the youth.

“Today, none of you will be able to leave here,” said Lin Yun as he walked forward. When he walked, the pressure emanating from him made many people’s hearts tremble.

“Who do you think you are! You dare to threaten us?!” The Elysium Trigram War Realm’s genius raised his brow before yelling, “Kill him!”

In the next second, three other war realm geniuses soared into the sky and charged towards Lin Yun. The three of them streaked across the horizon like three different comets.

Their auras were extremely terrifying, but they couldn’t match the golden light of divinity that burst out from Lin Yun. Suddenly, an ancient rune bloomed in Lin Yun’s hand that manifested the Golden Crow.

The faces of Lin Yun’s attackers changed as they tried to defend themselves. But their efforts were futile as they were obliterated without being able to do anything. Lin Yun’s Divine Glorysun Fist was a lot stronger than it was in the past. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

As golden light flashed on Lin Yun’s body, he charged towards the altar.

Facing Lin Yun, the Elysium Trigram War Realm’s genius took out his whip and cracked it in the air. The whip wasn’t ordinary because it had a remnant divine rune from ancient times. If his cultivation was stronger, the power of the whip would also be a lot stronger. But even so, the whip was already terrifying and invincible against those who weren’t from the Ten War Realms.

But he wasn’t the only one to make his move as the golden-clothed youth from the Profound Dragon War Realm also made his move.

“Black Dragon Ruler!” The crowd exclaimed beneath the altar because of the ruler that was swinging at Lin Yun. Although it was a replica, it still wasn’t something that the whip could be compared with.

But they weren’t the only ones to make a move. The remaining geniuses from the war realms also made their moves. As for the higher realm geniuses who had submitted to the war realms, they were afraid and quickly retreated. After they retreated, they began to use sword aura and various means to attack from long distance.

Facing the siege of the war realm geniuses, Lin Yun brought out the Azure Dragon Saint Armor with purple-golden runes. Like an azure dragon, Lin Yun took the whip head-on while throwing out a punch towards the Black Dragon Ruler. Just like that, a huge battle broke out as a group of people ganged up against Lin Yun. But even so, Lin Yun had no fear in his eyes when he faced them.

At the same time, Lin Yun had executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations and Divine Flicking Finger. He shuttled among the war realms to kill the higher realm geniuses who were standing far away. As blood splashed down with their screams, Lin Yun began to take down his enemies one by one.

When the geniuses beneath the altar saw this scene, their eyes became watery. It also shocked many top-tier geniuses because the whip and ruler couldn’t do a thing to Lin Yun. “Even an ancient dao artifact and the Black Dragon Ruler are useless against him?”

“Hanging Sun, Absolute Dominance!” Boundless golden light shined out of Lin Yun’s body as he hovered in the air like a sun. At the same time, his hair fluttered in the wind while emitting an overbearing aura. When he threw another punch out, the Black Dragon Ruler was sent flying with cracks spreading out on it. At this moment, the golden-clothed youth was flying and throwing up blood. When the golden-clothed youth retreated, his eyes were filled with fear.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun’s palm landed on the whip, causing the whip to fall down. Although the spectators heard that Lin Yun was strong, they never expected Lin Yun to be so strong that two weapons couldn’t do anything to him.

Just like that, Lin Yun suppressed his enemies all by himself. When the Black Dragon Ruler flew out again, a bitter howl sounded out as if the dragon soul of the ruler was afraid. As for the other attackers, they were also swept up by the shockwave and threw up mouthfuls of blood.

“Die!” Lin Yun grabbed onto a person and pushed his palm out, destroying half of that person’s body. Just like that, Lin Yun wreaked havoc among his enemies, suppressing them before targeting the Elysium Trigram War Realm’s genius who spoke at the beginning of the fight.

“S-stop him!” The Elysium Trigram War Realm’s genius screamed as he was overwhelmed with fear. At this moment, he realized that Lin Yun was an extraordinary talent who could compete with the top-tier geniuses in Kunlun Realm. He was already overwhelmed with despair because an ancient dao artifact wasn’t enough against Lin Yun.

He tried to lash out his whip to stop Lin Yun, but the whip couldn't even get close.

“Get over here!” Lin Yun roared as he grabbed the youth.

“N-no! D-don’t kill me! I’m a war realm genius. I’ll be useful to you if you keep me alive!” The Elysium Trigram War Realm’s youth begged for his life because he didn’t want to die.

But Lin Yun merely dragged his fingers across the youth’s throat like a sword. With a splat, the youth’s head dropped to the ground. Then, Lin Yun gently waved his hand and destroyed the decapitated head.

“No!” The geniuses of the war realms were screaming in fear. Since when did the war realms get bullied?

Lin Yun didn’t say another word as nine suns rose behind him. Walking towards the altar, he threw one punch after another. Just like that, all of the geniuses from the war realms were being slaughtered one by one.

When Lin Yun stood at the peak of the altar, all he saw were corpses below him. The blood of the war realms was flowing down the altar, causing everyone’s souls to be gripped with fear.

“Flower Burial! Invincible Lin Yun!” At this moment, everyone recovered from their shock and began to cheer.

There were still several terrifying auras on the gigantic statue, which meant that the war realm still had a few tricks for Lin Yun. However, Lin Yun wasn’t afraid. “War realm ants, come to your death!”

The crowd was shocked. Lin Yun was insane to declare war against three war realms.
