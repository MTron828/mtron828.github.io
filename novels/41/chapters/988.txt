Chapter 989 - Test Begins

Lin Yun’s words made Luo Chen feel relieved. Although Luo Chen would give his stage to Lin Yun if Lin Yun asked for it, it would also create a barrier between them. Luo Chen sat down and cupped his hands together, “I owe you a favor. Let me know if you need any help in the future.”

Lin Yun nodded his head and sat down on his stage as well. Now that everything had calmed down, the plaza became quiet.

“Azure dragon’s heart…I wonder what kind of inheritance is waiting for me,” muttered Lin Yun as he closed his eyes. When he poured his origin energy into the stage, fine golden runes spread out from the stage and enveloped Lin Yun.

Similar scenes appeared on the other stages, but those golden runes weren’t comparable to the likes of Lin Yun and Luo Chen. After all, the horns and heart stages were exclusive stages. After everyone shut their eyes, Yu Haotian raised his head to look at Lin Yun. His brows were furrowed as killing intent flashing in his eyes.

Lin Yun had humiliated Yu Haotian during the Profound Amber Realm’s Draconic Banquet. Furthermore, Lin Yun nearly took his life twice, which caused him to go from the top of the world to the bottom.

He initially thought that he could turn the tables around in the Heavenly Path, but he ended up running for his life once again. With all these scenes appearing in his mind, Yu Haotian’s face became grave. He knew that it was time for them to resolve their grudges.

He also didn’t trust the demonic spirit entirely either, especially after witnessing how those geniuses died the moment they came here. Compared to the demonic spirit, he trusted his strength even more. However, he knew that he needed the demonic spirit’s help if he wanted to kill Lin Yun.

If he could double his strength with the inheritance, he would have at least a 50-60% chance of beating Lin Yun. With his powerful artifact, he had an additional 10% chance of winning. Then, after resolving his grudge with Lin Yun, he needed to think about the demonic spirit. He had his own plans in the Heavenly Path and looked forward to Kunlun Realm. But first, Lin Yun had to die!

Closing his eyes, Yu Haotian sat on the stage representing the azure dragon tail to comprehend his own inheritance. After all the array were activated on the plaza, the golden runes melted away and everyone disappeared from the stages. The once bustling stages were now empty.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he saw a patch of darkness in front of him. This scene caused him to panic briefly before he quickly composed himself. He could sense traces of spatial law, which assured him that the stage sent him here. “Where am I?”

Lin Yun was certain that there was a test waiting for him. After all, the opportunity above fortune wasn’t handed out to just anybody. Not long after, Lin Yun’s eyes adjusted to the dim light.

He slowly started to see the outline of a massive purple gate. The gate was engraved with ancient dragon runes and stars circled the very top of it. It looked like a dragon gate. Sensing the boundless dragon aura, Lin Yun used his sword intent to protect himself.

“This is the inheritance of the azure dragon’s heart?” Lin Yun’s eyes blazed with flames when he looked at the dragon gate. As he observed the gate, it lit up and converged into a massive purple and gold heart that throbbed with power. Lin Yun’s heartbeat soon matched the pace of the dragon’s heart.

“You’ve passed the initial test and your physique has fulfilled the lowest requirement. You’re qualified to open the gate and participate in the test.”

Hearing that ancient voice, Lin Yun’s face changed and asked, “Who are you?”

“I’m the dragon spirit that’s in charge of the inheritance. The time flow here is different from the outside. Ten days is equivalent to the time it takes for a stick of incense to burn.” The voice sounded out once more to dispel Lin Yun’s concerns.

“What does that azure dragon’s heart inheritance represent?” asked Lin Yun.

“The heart is the source of life. Even if you have a powerful physique, the heart is still the most important thing. The azure dragon’s heart represents a body-refining technique. Your choice and physique determined your test,” said the dragon spirit. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Lin Yun thought that the heart stage would be a cultivation technique, and he was somewhat correct. The Azure Dragon Battle Physique was his weakest power, so he could cover his weakness if he obtained a decent body-refining technique. But he also couldn’t help feeling disappointed that it wasn’t a sword sutra or sword technique.

“What’s the inheritance above fortune in the Azure Dragon Palace?” Lin Yun asked.

“The test will soon begin and you will experience life and death. You will endure the light of flames and blood that have been manifested into lightning. It won’t be easy to pass the test. If you fail, you won’t obtain the inheritance. Giving up halfway will also result in failure and your inheritance will be withheld,” said the dragon spirit. After it was done, the dragon gate lit up brightly and opened.

“Looks like I still don’t have the qualification to ask… or maybe the dragon spirit doesn’t know what the opportunity above fortune is.” Lin Yun pondered briefly before looking at the gate with a light flashing through his pupils, “I should take a look at the test.”

Lin Yun stepped into the gate without any hesitation. But when he saw his test, his jaw dropped. The sky was covered in darkness while lightning struck the ground. The stench of blood drilled its way into Lin Yun’s nostrils as he stood still.

Sensing the discomfort, Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood as he made his way forward. He had never smelled such a dense stench of blood before. The boundless vitality in the blood wasn’t something that his physique could bear immediately. It was something that he slowly adjusted to.

Lin Yun made his way over to a mysterious black ocean. With his hands, he scooped some water to examine what was going on. “What the hell is this place?!”

The black water in his hands was blood. Lin Yun recalled the dragon spirit’s words. Could it be that this blood belongs to the azure dragon? If it really was the azure dragon’s blood, then this place was a treasure. With the dragon blood to forge one’s body, even an ordinary person could obtain an opportunity above fortune.

“No. If it was the azure dragon’s blood, I would’ve been burned to death.” Lin Yun knew that he could only refine one or two droplets of azure dragon’s blood with his current cultivation. But he could sense the azure dragon’s aura coming from the ocean of blood, which was weird.

Blood manifesting into lightning? Lin Yun suddenly thought about something. Perhaps this ocean of blood contained the blood of demonic beasts with azure dragon bloodline. If that was the case, then he couldn’t refine the blood or else there would be dire consequences.

Lin Yun tried to soar into the sky, but he was instantly suppressed by a faint pressure. Looking at the ocean, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he thought about the dragon aura he came in contact with earlier. “Perhaps I can resist it for a brief moment using the Golden Crow Nine Transformations…”

When he raised his head and looked at the dazzling flames at the end of the horizon, Lin Yun slowly walked on top of the ocean. “Light of flames? That’s where I need to go. It looks like the test is beginning.”
