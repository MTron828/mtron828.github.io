Chapter 2137: Don't Be Afraid. I'll Bring You Over

Lin Yun wiped off the blood stain that was on the sword and walked over to An Liuyan. When he got close, he smiled, “Boss An, come on.”

An Liuyan’s eyes contained deep affection, and she still hadn’t come to her senses. She didn’t expect to have such a position within Lin Yun’s heart, which frightened her. After all, Lin Yun made that declaration public.

But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by that. He was never bothered about the looks of others. He had his principles and would act without guilt, resolving everything else with his sword. If he spent his whole life cultivating and didn’t even dare to declare who he likes openly, he would be unworthy to be called a swordsman.

Since he was here, he didn’t want to hold back any longer and would obtain a spot for An Liuyan. They walked across the Dragon Mountain while he was holding onto An Liuyan’s wrist. This was the Indigo Dragon Path, a gathering of geniuses. Even someone as strong as Mo Li could only compete for a third-class spot here, unable to obtain a high ranking.

Looking at Lin Yun holding onto An Liuyan’s wrist and fearlessly walking forth made many cultivators on the Indigo Dragon Path unhappy. This was because the Indigo Dragon Path’s competition was intense, and the rankings were ferocious.

“Ye Qingtian, that’s enough!” After watching Lin Yun cross ten-odd seats, someone finally couldn’t hold back. This was a skinny youth donned in a white robe, holding onto a bamboo flute. He stood before Lin Yun. This person was the Falling Note Mountain’s holy son, Zhang Aoling, the senior brother of Mo Li, whom Lin Yun defeated. He was enveloped in invisible saint runes with music around him.

“Clown, others might give you a face, but I won’t tolerate you. It’s fine if you walk by yourself, but you want to bring a demoness like her and have her rank ahead of us? That’s impossible!” Zhang Aoling didn’t waste any words and fluttered the bamboo to his lips with his white robe.

In the next second, hundreds of musical instruments resounded from the surroundings, playing a majestic song. He was only playing the flute, but millions of soundwaves manifested into a few hundred phenomena.

When the shockwave swept out, cold music spread out as the music manifested into a golden pagoda. Zhang Aolin had grasped the Great Saint Tune and a greater dao, the Ice Dao. So when he played the ancient saint song, he summoned the legendary Heavenly Note Saint Pagoda. There were legends that this pagoda would increase according to one’s cultivation, and the incoming pagoda was a hundred feet with nine levels, releasing a powerful suppression.

“You can’t stop me.” Lin Yun drew out the Flower Burial Sword, executing the Divine Firefly Sword’s first sword form, the Withered Tree Coming To Life. When Lin Yun executed his sword technique, all the incoming sound waves were shattered. Then, Lin Yun lashed his arm out like a whip, destroying the Heavenly Note Saint Pagoda.

This naturally shocked Zhang Aoling because Lin Yun had only used one sword to destroy the array he had worked so hard to create. When the Heavenly Note Saint Pagoda shattered, Lin Yun’s sword ray felt like a tidal wave, compressing the air as it flew forth, creating cracks in the surrounding void.

This brought a drastic change to Zhang Aoling’s face. When he wanted to retreat, it was too late since Lin Yun’s sword aura had filled the entire space. With a flick of his sword, Lin Yun’s sword aura swept Zhang Aoling off of the Indigo Dragon Path.

Zhang Aoling naturally wasn’t convinced by his loss, but he could do nothing about it after being swept away by Lin Yun’s sword aura. The tidal wave enveloped him, like multiple layers of hammers smashing into him.

When Zhang Aoling flew out and landed on the ground, he threw out a mouthful of blood. His body was covered with thousands of tiny holes, and this made the cultivators who saw this feel their scalps going numb.

“Even a holy son lost so quickly?”

“If I remember correctly, Zhang Aoling is ranked in the top thirty on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking.”

“The top thirty rankings are a threshold, but even someone like Zhang Aoling was defeated by Ye Qingtian with one sword. Just how strong is Ye Qingtian?”

“Who can stop him on the Indigo Dragon Path?”

Another fight occurred on the Indigo Dragon Path before two holy sons were thrown off of the Dragon Mountain. With that, Lin Yun’s achievements have reached an unbelievable height. Even if several monstrous geniuses attacked him together, no one could stop his footsteps.

At this moment, Lin Yun had brought An Liuyan through the Dragon’s Torso, passing through the Dragon’s Claw and heading to the Dragon’s Head. This scene immediately caused an uproar because Ye Qingtian said that An Liuyan was his woman and wouldn’t allow anyone to bully her. Everyone only felt that he was young and arrogant. But now, something wasn’t right since Ye Qingtian was about to reach the Dragon’s Head, and he still brought An Liuyan along with him. Seeing a demoness obtaining such a high position nearly drove everyone insane.

“Ye Qingtian must be insane. Not only did he rescue her, but he even wants to bring her to the Dragon’s Head?”

“The Dragon’s Head of the Indigo Dragon Path is currently occupied by the champion of a Heavenly Path, Mu Qianjue.”

“Not only does Ye Qingtian want to challenge Mu Qianjue, but he even brought An Liuyan with him. What is he trying to do?”

“He’s not helping An Liuyan to obtain a champion position, right?” Someone made a bold speculation that immediately caused an uproar. Many cultivators paying attention to the other Dragon Mountains turned to the Indigo Dragon Path with disbelief. Ever since the dark ages ended, this was the first time the Blue Dragon Record appeared in the Kunlun Realm.

Let’s not mention the position of a Dragon’s Head; even a position at the Dragon’s Claw represented unimaginable resources. The already confirmed rewards were the Divine Dragon True Water, Demigod Wine, Divine Blood, Glory Saint Artifacts, Secret Treasures, the Dragon Clan’s martial techniques, and various Dragon Clan’s wines. As long as one managed to leave their name on the Blue Dragon Record, they could obtain unimaginable resources.

There were rumors that the champions of each path could obtain dragon bones, the dragon clan’s secret treasures, and even the dragon clan’s body-refining technique. Even if a holy land had a strong foundation, obtaining those resources was practically a pipe dream.

Aside from that, the champions would also receive a lord position and could meet the Empress personally, receiving her guidance. All the prodigies in the world were gathered on the nine Dragon Mountains, competing amongst themselves just to obtain a good spot. They weren’t just fighting for fame and glory but also for resources that could greatly boost their strength.

So, what Ye Qingtian did was ridiculous in everyone’s eyes. He gave up being the True Dragon Path’s champion and even came to the Indigo Dragon Path for An Liuyan. Now, he was even bringing her to the Dragon’s Head, and his actions could no longer be described as arrogance.

“He’s not satisfied with having a demoness obtain a high spot in the Dragon’s Claw. He wants to head to the Dragon’s Head? That’s the Indigo Dragon Path, one of the Divine Dragon Paths!”

“Ye Qingtian is too much. He’s simply ignoring everyone and treating the Blue Dragon Record as a mere game!”

Some people were naturally unhappy with what Lin Yun was doing and looked at him with malice, especially the holy lands who had their disciples defeated by Lin Yun. They all felt humiliated, and they couldn’t accept this scene. The other holy lands also had gloomy faces because this was the Blue Dragon Record, not a mere game. Some exclaimed at Ye Qingtian’s actions and felt that he was extraordinary.

“Hey, he’s bringing his woman with him? Does the Blue Dragon Record allow this? This is something new.”

“Hahaha! Ye Qingtian is really a strange person. I’ve long heard that he’s arrogant and disregards the eyes of others, but I never expected him to act in this manner, even during the Blue Dragon Record.”

“It’s no wonder why he’s called the Holy Maiden Killer. No, even a demoness has fallen to him now. He’s the model for us all!” Some young cultivators exclaimed at what Lin Yun did, and they couldn’t help feeling admiration for him. There were also women with their eyes shining brightly, enviously looking at Ye Qingtian.

“It’s no wonder why he’s called a Holy Maiden Killer, he even disregards the Blue Dragon Record for the woman he loves.”

“An Liuyan is too fortunate. How good will it be to have someone like him standing before her? I would be satisfied even if he fails.”

“You? Forget it. An Liuyan might be a demoness, but her beauty is top-notch. I have to give it to Ye Qingtian’s eyesight.”

“Get lost!” Lin Yun’s actions sparked an uproar, attracting everyone’s attention. This was because Ye Qingtian was too unique. Even Saint Elder, Mu Xueling, and the high priest of the Profound Imperial Palace, Zi Ling, have set their sights on Ye Qingtian.

“That young man is really brave, but it’s a pity that he’s wasting his talent by making so many enemies. Even if he’s strong, he will still be targeted.” Zi Ling shook her head unhappily. As an official of the Empress, she naturally had high eyesight and could tell that Lin Yun’s strength was extraordinary. She cherishes talent but disliked what Lin Yun was doing now by giving up his prospects for a woman. She turned her head over, asking with a smile, “Saint Elder, how do you look at it?”

“He’s courting death,” Mu Xueling replied.

“Haha. That’s indeed the truth. After all, Mu Qianjue is the one on the Dragon’s Head,” Zi Ling smiled, but she didn’t comprehend the deeper meaning of Mu Xueling’s words. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As the sky gradually became dark, a scorching red gleam shone from the far end of the horizon. The moonlight released a blurred light like a veil covering the sky. No matter what everyone said, Lin Yun led An Liuyan to the Dragon’s Head step by step.

“Young Master, I won’t be going any further,” An Liuyan said.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Yun asked, turning his head around.

“It’s fine for me to look at you from afar.” An Liuyan’s face became rosy as she looked at Lin Yun. She felt uneasy because she could sense the malicious gazes from the surroundings. Now that the Dragon’s Head wasn’t far away, she didn’t want to cause any trouble for Lin Yun and was already satisfied after seeing him again.

She never thought she could come this far on the Blue Dragon Record; the scenery here was great. This was a stage that belonged to Lin Yun.

“Some sceneries can be further appreciated if you get closer to them.” Lin Yun smiled as he held An Liuyan’s hand and said, “Don’t be afraid. I’ll bring you there.”
