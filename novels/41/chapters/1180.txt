Chapter 1181 - Butchering Field

Three-headed Flame Demon Hounds were in the astral stage along with possessing an overlord bloodline. But this hound seemed to be starved for days with hunger flickering in its pupils.

“How should we fight?”

“It’s an overlord Flame Demon Hound. Even if we use our weapons, we might not be able to harm it.” As the Flame Demon Hound approached, many people’s faces turned pale. They knew that the little miss’ test was a little too much. In the beast field, a young swordsman who was in the Astral Stage soared into the sky and brought out the constellations from within his body. When the painting appeared, the demonic aura pouring over him was forced back.

“That’s a constellation?” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he noticed everyone had different constellations. Each constellation caused one’s aura to surge and greatly empowered them. This was especially apparent for elemental constellations like flames that could boost the power of flame martial intent.

The constellations were similar to a fusion of martial souls and starlight. Good thing I didn’t let Luo Kui bring out his constellation.

As the beast field began to tremble violently, the Flame Demon Hound unleashed a ferocious attack that swordsmen in the Astral Stage could barely fend off. At this moment, everyone was attacking while they retreated. The Flame Demon Hound had been starving, so it was no different from a mad dog.

Suddenly, a bloody scene appeared as the Flame Demon Hound tore a figure apart in the air. Then, it raised its head to look at everyone else.

“This…”

“Is this for real?” Some swordsmen began to tremble with fear. They were here for the invitation, and they had no intention of giving their life for it.

Meanwhile, Yan Zijing and the others in the sky sneered because these people didn’t understand the little princess’ temper. The little princess was known to be a demoness in Azure Rock County, and no one dared to provoke her. But it was good for them that more people would die because the invitations were limited.

Looking at this butcher, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with rage. When he raised his head, he could see many people watching the beast field. Before he could think more about it, the Flame Demon Hound started attacking again.

The beast field suddenly fell into panic. There were those who used their holy spirit martial techniques, but they were shocked to discover that it didn’t deal much damage to the Flame Demon Hound.

“My heavens!” More and more people began to feel despair. The little miss of the Feng Clan was sitting in a pavilion above the beast field. She wore a short dress as she laughed at the people running for their lives.

“These pieces of trash can’t even be compared to my dog. They’re really shameless to want to participate in the Sword Assembly,” said the little miss of the Feng Clan with a mocking expression.

“They’re impudent to want to take the invitation, not to mention seeing our little miss,” a maid smiled.

“They’re just a bunch of frogs in the well,” said the little miss of the Feng Clan. “Those who are capable have already received the invitation. I hate these people who bite more than they can chew the most. They’re clearly trash, but they still want to participate in the Sword Assembly? Watch carefully! None of them are allowed to draw their sword. Don’t let them injure my precious dog.”

“Haha. Don’t worry about it, little miss. We have ways to deal with them if they dare to draw their sword,” smiled the maid.

“Don’t let all of them die either. Let them crawl out of the dog hole once my dog is full. I’m still interested to see the gifts they brought for me,” smiled the little miss.

Right at this moment, a sword hum echoed out that made the little miss’ face sink before she tossed a whip over to her maid. The whip was a saint artifact that flickered with lightning. As soon as the maid wielded the whip, the person who drew his sword was sent flying.

The youth howled in pain, but the maid didn’t let him go. She continued to whip the youth until he was covered in blood and the wounds revealed his bones.

“Don’t forget what you guys said. This is the outcome if anyone dares to draw their sword!” The maid said coldly. Her words made everyone’s face turn pale. The Flame Demon Hound’s defenses were shocking, and there was no way they could injure it without using their sword.

Meanwhile, Yan Zijing and the others who were the strongest weren’t fighting seriously because they didn’t want to offend the little miss. So there was no way they could deal with the Flame Demon Hound. Furthermore, Yan Zijing and the rest probably wanted to see more people die because it would decrease the number of competitors. This also meant that the Flame Demon Hound was practically invincible in the beast field.

“A bunch of lowlifes want to hurt my dog? They’re simply courting death!” The little miss looked at the person who drew his sword coldly.

“Little miss, why don’t I continue to give him a few more whips?” The maid smiled.

“Forget it. My dog might not like it if the meat is too messed up,” smiled the little miss.

But right at this moment, a series of sword hums echoed out that caused the entire beast field to tremble violently. Instantly, the little miss and her maids thought that someone drew their sword.

But when they swept their gazes out, they didn’t see anyone with a sword. On the other hand, there was an azure figure who emitted a thunderous sword hum. Before anyone could react, that azure figure had already dashed forward, unleashing a series of attacks.

When he landed on the ground, the Flame Demon Hound was howling in pain with all of its fangs broken. Just like that, the Flame Demon Hound that was ferocious instantly died down while Lin Yun patted his hands together.

The result instantly drew the shocked gazes of Yan Zijing and his group. Lin Yun was too fast for them to see how the Flame Demon Hound was defeated. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“How dare he injure the little miss’ dog!” The maid’s face became cold as she prepared to use the whip.

“Stop. Let them come out. I’ll deal with him myself.” The little miss said with her face dark and her eyes flashing with a vicious light.

While the Flame Demon Hound lay on the ground, a small hole appeared on the wall as the maid said, “You all passed. You can come out now!”

When she was done, she even glared at Lin Yun who dared to injure her little miss’ dog. Everyone fearfully thanked the little miss of the Feng Clan before they crawled out of the hole. But the hole was small, and one had to crawl out on all fours.

The youth around Yan Zijing’s faces turned dark, “Isn’t that a freaking dog door?!”

“We’ll crawl!” Yan Zijing said coldly.
