Chapter 1095 - The Mountain Isn't Lonely Because Of Me

Lin Yun was briefly distracted when he looked at Lil’ Purple. Although he had already seen her appearance in his subconscious space, this was the first time that he saw her in person. She looked like she was only five or six years old.

The feathers that she wore looked flawless, like the masterpiece of a craftsman. Lin Yun couldn’t believe that such a flawless looking person existed. However, when he looked at her braids, he couldn’t stop smiling. No matter how flawless she looked, her braids made her look like a little girl.

Lil’ Purple swept a glance at Lin Yun before saying, “Let me beat you up and vent out my anger. Hmph!”

Then, she shot out towards Lin Yun with her adorable fist aiming at Lin Yun’s head. But Lin Yun was already prepared for it and easily dodged the attack. The two of them looked as if they were teleporting on the stage and Lin Yun appeared where she previously stood, taking a few steps back cautiously in the process.

“What speed!” Lil’ Purple was surprised before she waved her hand at Lin Yun to summon the Silver Moon mask from Lin Yun’s interspatial pouch.

When Lin Yun saw this scene, he was shocked that someone else could take an item out of his interspatial pouch. It was simply unheard of.

After Lil’ Purple retrieved the mask, her eyes shined brightly. She ignored Lin Yun and put it on her face. When she wore the mask, her hair became silver. Her clothes and temperament had also undergone a transformation. She was an ancient ice phoenix, to begin with. So the silver color revealed her sacred aura.

“I’m eighteen years old. Each year represents one era. I was born before heaven and earth were formed, so I won’t die even if heaven and earth are destroyed. I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths! Even the friends and divine dragons have to be respectful to me! And after 100,000 years, I’m back!” Her voice sounded like pearls dropping onto a silver plate. It was crips and ethereal. After Lin Yun heard her speech, he felt like he was looking at a living legend.

“Hehe, Lil’ Lin Yun, am I beautiful?” Lil’ Purple examined herself and spun on the stage.

Her words brought Lin Yun back to reality. Casually glancing at her, Lin Yun casually replied, “Not bad.”

“Hmph, what do you mean by not bad?” Lil’ Purple snorted and turned to look at Lil’ Red, “Kitty, am I gorgeous?”

Lil’ Red, who was being stared at, suddenly felt all the hair on its back standing up. Violently, Lil’ Red nodded its head.

“See! Look at how good this kitty’s eyesight is. No one’s beauty can compare to mine. Since I just woke up, I’m in need of a servant. Lin Yun, do you want to be my servant?” Lil’ Purple folded her arms and looked at Lin Yun.

“Return the mask,” said Lin Yun.

Lil’ Purple raised her head and wore a disdainful smile, “You’re really naive. Do you think I’ll give you something that I got with my own ability? What can you do to me?”

But the moment she finished, Lin Yun waved her hand and took the mask back. He had left his mark in the mask, so no one could take it away from him as long as he was still alive. When the moonlight shattered, Lil’ Purple’s appearance returned back to normal like a fairy dropping back to earth. Then, Lin Yun saw a crimson mark and a golden mark on her forehead. They were both divine runes.

The crimson divine rune belonged to her, while the golden one came from the Azure Dragon True Bone. Similar to Lin Yun’s mark, they gave her a bewitching appearance. If Lin Yun didn’t look at them so carefully, he wouldn’t be able to discover how profound they were.

“Stupid Lin Yun!” Lil’ Purple became furious as she charged at Lin Yun. Unfortunately for her, Lin Yun knew this would happen. She had just woken up, so her cultivation wasn’t strong. Her movements might seem fast, but her movements were in slow motion in his eyes. So he casually reached out and grabbed onto her collar.

“Put me down!” Lil’ Purple waved her fists around furiously, but her arms were too short to make contact with Lin Yun. She was so furious that she puffed her cheeks out before breathing out.

“What are you doing?” Lin Yun asked.

“I’m breathing flames at you! My Divine Ice Phoenix Flame can kill a divine dragon! Are you afraid now?” Lil’ Purple wore a smug face as she said that.

Looking at her, Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling, “Continue then.”

At this moment, Lil’ Purple had finally faced reality. But even so, she still wasn’t willing to admit defeat, “My state isn’t at the best right now. Otherwise, you would be dead right now!”

“It’s dawn!” Lin Yun looked at the rising sun and said, “I have some matters to attend to. So you can stay here for now.”

“I’m coming along!” Lil’ Purple recalled something and smiled, “Don’t think that I don’t remember what that old geezer did. I want to see you get trampled on!”

“It won't be appropriate for others to see you around me.” Lin Yun examined Lil’ Purple. He had to admit that Lil’ Purple was adorable, and that she would easily attract everyone’s attention. There were a lot of people in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and he couldn’t be sure that there weren’t any perverts around.

“Hmph! Do you think just anyone can see my appearance?” Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes before she flew into the runes on the sword box that Lin Yun was carrying.

Lin Yun was surprised. He finally understood why he couldn’t put the sword box into his interspatial pouch. It turned out that it had its own individual space. Lin Yun began to wonder if he could also enter the space. However, he stopped thinking about it and glanced at the Flying Cloud Palace.

The Flying Cloud Palace was located at Flying Cloud Mountain. It was the closest mountain to Sword Saint Mountain. People would rarely gather here unless they had nothing else to do.But today, there was a constant flow of people, which began at dawn.

Aside from those who weren’t in the sect or were in seclusion, all the disciples were here. On the highest platform, there were also many elders who were rarely seen. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had never been so busy. However, no one seemed happy.

“An outsider who isn’t even in the seventh soul will become a core disciple of our Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? The sect master is really muddle-headed.”

“This is simply too shocking. We’ve been cultivating for so long. Does he really think that we can’t even be compared to someone from the lower realm?”

“I won’t say anything if he was a transcendent genius, but he wasn’t even on the white ranking. The only reason he’s here is because of Senior Feng Jue.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“He’s not Senior Feng Jue’s illegitimate son, right?” There were all sorts of discussions around the Flying Snow Palace. If Feng Jue heard those conversations, he would vomit blood

“Senior Brother Feng, everyone seems to be very unhappy. It seems like we’ll have a good show to watch.” Several core disciples were comforting Feng Zhang.

This made Feng Zhang smile, but he still maintained his silence. He had already given his permission to the others to do what they wanted. After all, he would take full responsibility. His endorsement gave everyone around him the confidence to express their displeasure.

Donned in a purple dress, Ye Ziling stood out among the core disciples with her bewitching appearance. Her face was frosty and no one dared to approach her aside from Wang Yuruo.

“The entire sect stirred up because of this outsider.” Ye Ziling was already unhappy with Lin Yun even before he showed up.

Suddenly, the entire Flying Cloud Palace became so quiet that the sound of leaves falling could be heard. Ye Ziling raised her brow as a person walked into the Flying Cloud Palace. He was carrying a sword box on his back and a black cat in his arms.

His appearance made everyone become quiet as they looked at him with ill intent. When Lin Yun saw the formation, he smiled. All the outer, inner, and core disciples were present. It made him feel proud that he could create such a huge commotion. So he continued to smile and walk.
