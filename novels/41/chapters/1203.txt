Chapter 1204 - Four Phase Sword Array!

The Grand Elder of the Feng Clan was in the quasi-Dragon Pulse Realm. When he descended from the sky, he was accompanied by a boundless sword aura. When he landed on the plaza, he caused the whole stage to shake.

The Grand Elder’s name was Feng Tianyuan, and he was the younger brother of Feng Xuanzi.

“His cultivation is in the quasi-Dragon Pulse Realm, right?” Lin Yun asked while he looked at Feng Xuanzi.

“What’s wrong with that?” Feng Xuanzi replied indifferently. “He hasn’t reached the Dragon Pulse Realm, and he’ll seal his cultivation to the Heavenly Soul Realm in his fight with you. This doesn’t violate the rules of the Hidden Sword Manor in any way. You can give up if you’re afraid!”

Lin Yun couldn’t help cursing at Feng Xuanzi’s shamelessness. The difference between the quasi-Dragon Pulse Realm and Elysium Core Realm was huge. In fact, an Elysium Core Realm couldn’t even take a single attack from a quasi-Dragon Pulse Realm.

“Little bastard, the Feng Clan has already given you face by following the restrictions. But do you really think that I won’t hesitate to teach you a lesson?” Feng Tianyuan barked as he took a step forward and spread out his aura. He wanted to teach Lin Yun a lesson before he sealed his cultivation.

“I advise you to behave yourself.” Lin Yun glanced at Feng Tianyuan and secretly activated the seal of the Firmament Battle Cloth. All Lin Yun needed to do was retrieve the Lightning Shadow Sword. The old geezer didn’t even tell him to follow the rules. So if the Feng Clan took advantage of him in any way, he would sweep through them with the Firmament Battle Cloth and snatch the Lightning Shadow Sword forcibly.

Lin Yun was annoyed with the Feng Clan and didn’t want to waste any more time. So he looked at Feng Tianyuan with killing intent. His gaze was so strong that Feng Tianyuan felt a chill run down his spine as if he had entered hell.

When Feng Tianyuan recovered from his shock, he immediately withdrew his aura. He realized that Lin Yun had a terrifying trump card, which also meant that Lin Yun had a terrifying origin.

“I’m only joking with you. So, are you going to challenge the third round or not?” Feng Tianyuan smiled. He was determined to kill Lin Yun in the third round and there was nothing Lin Yun could do even if he had a trump card.

But Lin Yun didn’t bother with him and continued to look at Feng Xuanzi, “I didn’t say that there was anything wrong. Since you’re going to follow the rules, I hope you can remember your words later. After all, I don’t wish to massacre your Feng Clan.”

Everyone was shocked by Lin Yun’s tone. Who would have thought that a Heavenly Soul Realm would dare speak to Feng Xuanzi in such a manner. After all, not even a saint dared to speak to Feng Xuanzi like that.

Feng Xuanzi was naturally furious when he heard that, but suppressed his rage. With Feng Tianyuan around, he was confident that Lin Yun would die. So there was no need for him to get worked up over a dead person. Stroking his beard, Feng Xuanzi said coldly, “No one dares to break the rules set by the Hidden Sword Manor, not even me. You can go ahead and leave with the Lightning Shadow Sword if you can make it through. But if you die in the third round, you can’t blame anyone.”

“You’re so sure that I won’t be able to make it through the third round?” Lin Yun smiled upon hearing Feng Xuanzi’s words.

“You can give it a try if you’re unconvinced,” sneered Feng Xuanzi.

“Let’s begin then.” Lin Yun turned to look at Feng Tianyuan.

Everyone felt nervous for Lin Yun. After all, the swordsmen in the first two rounds were only in the Empyrean Realm. Now, Lin Yun was about to face Elysium Core Realm experts. Although they had sealed their cultivation in the Heavenly Soul Realm, they were still much stronger than the swordsmen from the previous rounds.

“Let’s start!” Feng Tianyuan spoke with a grave expression while the three elders also began to seal their cultivation at the pinnacle of Heavenly Soul Realm. After they were done, they drew their swords.

As for Lin Yun, he backed off while a sword ray streaked past his face. Then, he raised his sword to block another sword ray that was assaulting him.

When their swords clashed together, Lin Yun’s face changed. He took three steps back as surprise flashed through his pupils. Each one of his new opponents were as strong as the Azure Dragon Sword Array. He was basically facing the power of four Azure Dragon Sword Arrays at the same time.

No wonder Feng Xuanzi was so confident. But Lin Yun brought out the Azure Dragon Sword Aura and raised his sword before him to block the third attack. The collision was so strong that sparks flew everywhere.

Lin Yun’s footsteps were heavy as he fought the attack head-on. When he was done, he pushed the Flower Burial Sword and sent his opponent flying. But his opponent gently landed on the ground, dispersing Lin Yun’s attack like it was nothing.

Right at this moment, crimson flames swept over as Feng Tianyuan charged over with a sinister smile. His sword aura manifested a blazing meteor that displayed all of the flaws of Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Aura.

Lin Yun took several steps back before he managed to stabilize himself, and each of his footsteps would cause the ground to tremble. But when he was done stabilizing himself, three sword rays charged at his vital points.

He would die if any of the attacks landed, so he quickly reacted with the Golden Crow Nine Transformations. Afterimages filled the air as he dodged hundreds of sword rays.

When Lin Yun broke free from their attacks, his clothes were tattered and covered with blood. Although he managed to fend off the fatal attacks, he still suffered serious injuries. The audience sucked in a cold breath because it had only been a few seconds. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The danger of the third round was on a completely new level as Lin Yun was facing elders that were several hundred years old. All of them were experienced in fighting and had deep attainments in the way of the sword.

Finally, Feng Tianyuan’s meteorite arrived in front of Lin Yun. Lin Yun supported his sword with two hands, but he was still sent flying away from the attack.

Feng Tianyuan sneered as he watched the other elders unleash their sword aura to deal with Lin Yun.

Lin Yun knew that he needed to do something or else he would die a terrible death. This round was completely different from the first two rounds. After all, he was facing Elysium Core Realm experts. Although he had the advantage in the Heavenly Soul Realm, he knew that he would lose his advantage if he faced more than two opponents.

“Little bastard, do you know how strong I am now?” Feng Tianyuan looked at Lin Yun with a sinister expression. He was enjoying the fight.

“Sun Concealing Clouds!” As the sword cocoon in Lin Yun’s forehead bloomed, the boundless Azure Dragon Sword Aura appeared once more. He quickly executed the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords to defend himself. Lin Yun faced the three elders head-on, but they were facing him with their holy spirits.

Lin Yun fell into a disadvantageous position, but all he could do was rely on his high attainment in the sword. At least the three elders hadn’t brought their holy spirit martial technique to the peak manifestation stage.

When they summoned their holy spirits, Lin Yun barely managed to face the three of them head-on. But it was clear that Lin Yun would be exhausted to death.

Countless phenomena appeared and disappeared from the stage as the holy spirits clashed with Lin Yun’s sword rays. Lin Yun was putting on an impressive show that made everyone realize how talented he was.

Gognsun Yan’s eyes dimmed down because he finally understood the huge gap between him and Lin Yun. Right at this moment, a burst of laughter sounded out from the sky where starlight was shining down, “Hahaha! Brat, it’s over!”

As Feng Tianyuan laughed, his sword aura condensed into a scary attack, “Meteorite Sword!”

Then, Feng Tianyuan charged over as Lin Yun was busy dealing with the other elders.

Cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes as he summoned the Demonic Astral Flowers. Clearly, he had been waiting for Feng Tianyuan.
