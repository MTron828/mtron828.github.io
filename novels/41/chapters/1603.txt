Chapter 1604 - Lu Chen Is Here!

Before Lin Yun rushed over, he could see people shuttling across the sky. Countless geniuses were charging over.

“I can’t be wrong.” Lin Yun smiled, seeing this scene. In the past, when he noticed the explosion of spiritual energy or phenomena, he didn’t see anyone charging over. There was only an aroma lingering behind when he rushed over.

Since so many people were rushing over, this proved that this place hadn’t been discovered yet. In the end, Lin Yun arrived at where there was a group of people and saw a mountain.

There was a saint flower on the cliff, emitting a holy light, and the boundless spiritual energy in the air formed into seven-colored snowflakes that were descending.

“The Golden Lotus!” Lin Yun’s pupils flashed with joy. This was a saint flower of the Buddhism Sect. It was rare and would only be born at the top of a cliff, enveloped in nine golden lights. One could even hear the Buddhist mantra in the surroundings, and the scriptures were profound, containing unrivaled wisdom.

Lin Yun arrived, covered in dust, but couldn’t be bothered and squeezed through the crowd. The people in front of him were weird and didn’t hinder him, allowing him to squeeze his way through.

“Where did this piece of trash come from? Get lost!”

“My Myriad Beast Gate already occupies this place. Are you courting death?”

“Hahaha, what a joke. Where did this piece of trash come from?” Before Lin Yun could stabilize his footing, ten-odd figures soared from the cliff below and blocked Lin Yun’s path. When they saw Lin Yun’s dirt-covered state and his cultivation at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, they couldn’t help laughing.

There were countless opportunities in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, even at the boundary. Ancient records and saint pellets might be hard to find because one would have to go underground or to saint palaces. Those places were dangerous, but natural treasures weren’t that hard to find. Over the past ten-odd days, everyone had practically reached the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

Everyone had undergone a great boost in strength, and it was hard to imagine that someone in the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm dared to stand out. Not to mention that Lin Yun’s hair was unkept, and his clothes were tattered because of the wasps. This was why the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples were no longer furious after they took a closer look at Lin Yun.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun’s face was covered in excitement, looking at the Golden Lotus. He could sense a strong desire from the Flower Burial Sword that had just become a Radiant Saint Artifact. The sword was vibrating violently within the sword box.

Judging from the nine light rays, this further proved that this Golden Lotus seemed to have a huge origin. This made Lin Yun’s pupils shine brightly. The Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples and everyone else were also curiously looking at Lin Yun. Not only was Lin Yun still around, but he was also still staring at the Golden Lotus.

“Haha, where did this country bumpkin come from? He’s nearly drooling! Hahaha!”

“Get lost. I’ll dig your eyes out if you still dare to look!” The Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples roared.

One of them was donned in black clothes, and their eyes flickered coldly. The Myriad Beast Gate might be a big sect, but they had the Profound Sky Sect backing them up in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. So they were fearless and didn’t even place the other powerful sects in their eyes. But a mere ant at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm dared to eye something that belonged to them?

“Brat, leave quickly. We don’t want to kill you!”

“You idiot. Someone must have pushed you out. But you’re too weak for us to even kill!” The Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples were prideful and didn’t put Lin Yun in their eyes and turned to coldly look at those behind Lin Yun.

This instantly made those people panic as they took several steps back. But weirdly enough, Lin Yun’s attention was on the Golden Lotus. It was as if he was isolated from the outside world. Most importantly, Lin Yun started drooling and used his sleeves to clean the saliva dripping down.

This made the lips of the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples twitch with loathe flashing in their pupils.

“These people didn’t seem to have noticed that this Golden Lotus contains an origin saint rune! It might only be a ten thousand year saint elixir, but the Golden Lotus is a rare flower. Since it has nine golden lights, this Golden Lotus is of the highest grade!” Lin Yun’s heart was blazing with flames, and he was only thinking about the Golden Lotus.

This instantly gave him the confidence to reach the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and he could even use this opportunity to feed the Flower Burial Sword. This would further strengthen the power of the Flower Burial Sword as a Radiant Saint Artifact. It looks like he was pretty lucky to run into the Golden Lotus when he didn’t have any harvest for so long.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“This person is disgusting.” A black-clothed lady coldly said with loathing on her face.

“Senior Sister Liu, you don’t have to dirty your hands on a piece of trash like him. Let me do it.” Another Myriad Beast Gate disciple wore a fawning smile as he spoke to that lady before his face became cold upon turning to Lin Yun.

“Trash, why don’t you take a look at yourself!” As that disciple waved his hand, a blood arrow emitting a terrifyingly baleful aura was condensed and shot toward Lin Yun.

But when the arrow landed on Lin Yun, it only produced a metallic collision, and this instantly made the smiles on the faces of the other Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples freeze.

“There’s something weird about this brat!” The black-clothed lady said coldly. “Kill him quickly. Don’t let him disrupt our senior brother’s comprehension!”

All the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples simultaneously made a move, unleashing their attacks. They were all at the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and their vitalities boiled when they circulated their three pulses. Three crimson lights were formed into a beast tide that charged at Lin Yun.

Those beasts looked like they were alive, radiating terrifying demonic auras. But Lin Yun didn’t move. He was still looking at the Golden Lotus. He could hear some sounds in his ears, like an Arhat sharing Buddhism scripture. Even his sword intent within his brows had entered a form of comprehension and became ethereal.

When the beast tide charged over, Lin Yun only waved his hand, and the demonic beasts were reduced to a puddle of blood. But the blood was like a blazing volcano that instantly melted the ground when they fell, leaving the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples dumbfounded.

They had a tough time maintaining their composure and couldn’t imagine what had just happened. When they looked at Lin Yun again, they no longer had disdain and mockery in their pupils, and this surprised all the geniuses who had backed off earlier. Could this dirt-covered swordsman be a genius of the Golden Generation?

“The Myriad Beast Gate?” Lin Yun came to his senses and squinted his eyes.

“Ha. Isn’t that obvious?” That black-clothed lady said coldly, with killing intent brewing in her pupils. “Your eyes are disgusting.”

When she was done speaking, she appeared before Lin Yun with a flash. Her two fingers were aimed at Lin Yun’s eyes.

“Liu Feng made her move!”

“She’s a Golden Generation genius, only second to Lu Chen. Her cultivation is already at the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm before entering the Ancient Barren Battlefield. It looks like this swordsman is doomed.”

“This person is a little dumb.” The audience shook their heads with pity in their eyes.

As the black-clothed lady’s nails streaked across the air, everyone’s hearts sank because this woman was really ruthless, wanting to blind someone the moment she made a move.

But Lin Yun only took a step back to avoid this attack, making the black-clothed lady snort coldly. She naturally wouldn’t let Lin Yun go so easily and formed a claw with her hand that made her look like a terrifying demonic beast, and her hands were comparable to saint artifacts.

Since Lin Yun couldn’t avoid in time, her claw swiped across his chest and left behind several wounds. After Lin Yun took ten-odd steps back, he kept his smile on while looking at the wounds on his chest, “What speed!”

His heart might have been dug out if he didn’t react fast enough.

“Aren’t you a little too ruthless when I only took a few more glances at the Golden Lotus?” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“Who allowed you to see it?” Liu Feng’s pupils were radiating with killing intent. “My senior brother is comprehending the Golden Lotus, and your life isn’t enough to compensate if you disrupt his cultivation!”

“What a fiery temper.” Lin Yun wore a playful smile.

Seeing this, loathsomeness rose within Liu Feng’s heart again, and she said, “You have two choices. Either you dig your eyes out yourself, or I’ll help you. Otherwise, you can dream only about leaving!”

She loathed Lin Yun and wanted to use him as an example to warn everyone else. If she allowed any random person to jump out, her senior brother might as well give up on cultivating. The moment she spoke, several figures dashed forth and blocked Lin Yun’s path of retreat.

“Kill!” Liu Feng gave an order and the ten-odd disciples charged at Lin Yun. They were all at the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

But Lin Yun showed no signs of panic and dodged their attacks as though he was just taking a stroll. Relying on his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, he merely relied on his instincts to dodge and didn’t even have to do anything. In the end, he even closed his eyes.

As the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples grew increasingly anxious, Lin Yun dodged their attacks more easily.

“How is this possible…?” Everyone was dumbfounded because their attacks couldn’t even touch the corner of Lin Yun’s clothes. The audience behind them was also stumped, and they couldn’t comprehend what was happening before them.

Liu Feng’s gaze was on Lin Yun. She then suddenly made a move. With her five fingers aimed at Lin Yun’s heart, she turned into a streak of light, and she wore a sinister smile, “Die!”

But just when she wanted to circulate her dragon origin to dig out Lin Yun’s heart, she was shocked to discover that Lin Yun’s body was comparable to a myriad rune saint artifact. Not only did her nails fail to pierce through his defense, but she even broke her nails, and the pain made her widen her mouth with shock.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun suddenly widened his eyes. Accompanied by a dragon roar, his dragon aura exploded, and everyone who was attacking him was sent flying away, throwing out blood when they fell to the ground.

When they raised their heads, they could see the dragon runes on the surface of Lin Yun’s body. Lin Yun had activated his Azure Dragon Saint Physique.

“Who the hell are you?!” The black-clothed lady finally panicked.

“Is there a need for me to tell you that? Your dog eyes are really disgusting!” Lin Yun snickered.

This made the black-clothed lady furious because of what she had said to Lin Yun previously. This made Liu Feng’s heart sink as panic swept over her. She instantly knew that Lin Yun wanted to dig her eyes out, so she roared, “You dare?!”

“Hahaha! Why don’t I dare?” Lin Yun laughed, and activated the Divine Dragon Eyes. When the Glorymoon and Glorysun Spirits appeared within his eyes, the Blue Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal, and Silver Dragon Seal appeared.

Before the black-clothed lady could even respond, her eyeballs burst apart, leaving behind two holes with blood rolling down her cheeks.

This startled everyone in the surroundings, and they quickly retreated with their backs covered in a cold sweat. Right then, a figure slowly stood up from the cliff. Enveloped in a golden light, a voice rumbled that caused this entire region to tremble, “Lu Chen is here. Who the hell are you? Name yourself!”

Lu Chen was the Myriad Beast Gate’s chief disciple and was at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm before entering the Ancient Barren Battlefield, a genuine Golden Generation genius.
