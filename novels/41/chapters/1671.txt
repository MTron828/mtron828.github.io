Chapter 1672 – Courting Phoenix

“Is it hard?” Lil’ Purple smiled, looking at Lin Yun.

“It’s hard, but there will be no challenge if it’s not hard.” Lin Yun said with his brow raised.

“Hmph, trying to show off again.” Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes.

“Alright, let us begin.” Lin Yun was already impatient because he didn’t want to waste time.

“You just escaped death, and yet you’re trying to put your life on the line again. Calm down and get familiar with the Thunderstorm Zither, first. If you’re tired, go take a good rest.” Lil’ Purple said. She could guess Lin Yun had never taken a good rest since he entered the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

“I’m fine. My injuries aren’t something that can be recovered after a night of sleep.”

“But I’m tired.” Lil’ Purple quickly ignored Lin Yun and headed out of the valley.

This made Lin Yun helpless, but he could only spend time getting used to it. When he seriously examined the zither, he even tried to infuse his sword intent into it. When he poured his sword intent in it, the zither produced various sounds. There were sounds of thunderstorms, roaring divine dragons, and even phoenix cries. The sounds were weird. In the end, he just casually played with the zither, spreading a faint fluctuation.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because this Thunderstorm Zither was really weird. Perhaps it was the intent left behind by the Azure Dragon Lord when he played the zither in the past.

He ultimately chose to play the thunderstorm sound. Whenever he played the zither, there would be whistling of wind and rumbling of thunder, and he was trying to fuse them. He was even trying to merge his Azure Dragon Intent into the music. Without him knowing it, the night came, and a moon hung high in the sky.

He was completely submerged in it before he ultimately slept. When he woke up, a piece of serene flute music resounded under the moonlight, echoing within the valley. The music instantly captivated him, so he carried the zither deeper into the valley, where various flowers were blooming.

When he saw Lil’ Purple, she was basking under the moonlight as she played the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute. But he didn’t disrupt her and activated the Divine Dragon Eyes. When a sun and a moon bloomed within his pupils, he could see musical notes dancing like fairies.

Even Lin Yun couldn’t help but admit that Lil’ Purple was gorgeous at this moment. He ultimately sat down and emptied his heart. The moonlight was like a warm spring, and he was basking in it, tempering his body.

The golden saint rune shone brightly as moonlight entered the profound palace in his mind. That was the Golden Crow Saint Rune, and it was his primary saint rune when he became a Saint Spiritualist. As the saint rune shone brightly, it started undergoing a transformation under the music.

As the music continued, Lin Yun entered a zen state, allowing the moonlight to penetrate his mind. This made him feel at ease, and all the troubles were thrown to the back of his mind.

When the music ended, another saint rune was in his profound palace. This was a silver saint rune shining with moonlight, and the name of this saint rune was Phoenix.

This left Lin Yun in deep shock. He knew that the grades of a Saint Spiritualist were determined by the number of saint runes in their profound palace. So did this mean that he had become a second-grade Saint Spiritualist?

Furthermore, this new saint rune was related to Lil’ Purple’s Divine Rune. After all, it was her music that allowed him to benefit. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he asked, “Empress, what is the name of this song?”

“The Phoenix Heart Song.” Lil’ Purple replied.

“When you played this music, my mind changed a little, and my mental energy became stronger.” Lin Yun said. Spiritualists depended heavily on mental energy, which could also determine music dao to a certain degree.

After all, soundwaves were a special form of mental attack, so it was heavily related to mental energy. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Okay.” Lil’ Purple smiled, but she didn’t tell him she had prepared this for him. The Phoenix Heart Song was a song from the Divine Phoenix Clan meant to temper the soul and cleanse the heart, and she played this song on purpose.

“Let’s start with the fundamentals by practicing the song. I’ll play it for you using the Thunderstorm Zither.” A moment later, Lil’ Purple sat before the Thunderstorm Zither and explained as she played. But the entire process wasn’t that smooth. Lil’ Purple finally placed her hands on the zither strings and angrily asked, “How many times have you dazed off now?”

It was weird because Lin Yun didn’t pay attention to the song or zither but was staring at her face. Lin Yun smiled and replied, “The moon tonight is too beautiful.”

“It’s only a crescent moon.” Lil’ Purple said, raising her head.

Lin Yun raised his head and looked at the crescent moon and the gentle moonlight shining down. He said, “It’s still beautiful, like your eyes.”

When they both looked at each other, Lil’ Purple flicked her finger.

Lin Yun clutched his chest in pain because Lil’ Purple didn’t go easy on him, and her flick had quickly penetrated his body to the dragon pulses.

“You scumbag, what are you thinking about?!” Lil’ Purple said with her cheeks puffed.

Lin Yun smiled, lying on the grass patch, “What is a brat like you thinking about?”

“I’m not a brat! I’m a hundred thousand years old!”

“Correction, sealed for a hundred thousand years.”

“I’m also a few hundred years old before I was sealed!”

“The lifespan of the Divine Phoenix Clan is close to limitless. A few hundred years old is still a child among the Divine Phoenix Clan, hahaha!” Despite joking around, Lin Yun had a good talent and swiftly got used to the zither, gradually grasping the essence of the Phoenix Heart Song.

As night gradually deepened, Lin Yun was alone, practicing with the zither. When he started playing, the moonlight shining on him looked like it had come alive.

When Lin Yun played the zither, Lil’ Purple’s heart trembled as she watched. This was because Lin Yun was an absolute genius. As Lin Yun soon sank into the music with his eyes closed, the Golden Crow Rune and Silver Phoenix Rune resonated with the Thunderstorm Zither.

When his fingers swiped across the zither, it made the zither look as though it had come to life and shone brightly. Just like that, Lin Yun played the zither with serenity. He didn’t look like someone with his dragon pulses destroyed, which also dispelled all of Lil’ Purple’s concerns.

Without her knowing, a smile appeared on her face. She was worried that Lin Yun would fall hard because he stood in a high position. She was concerned that he wouldn’t be able to get back on his feet after his fall, and she realized that she was overly concerned.

Just like that, Lin Yun played for an entire night with his heart fully submerged in the zither. He didn’t feel tired at all. In the end, he even fused his Firmament Sword Intent into the zither and reached a resonation with heaven and earth. As a thunderstorm rumbled and the surrounding temperature fell, Lin Yun recalled what happened in the Ancient Barren Domain, and snow began to fall.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes the next day, he could sense his changes. He gained a lot of insight into music dao, bringing a brilliant smile to his face. He could feel that it wouldn’t be long before he grasped Saint Tone.

“It’s going to snow again?” Lin Yun reached out and caught a snowflake. He then turned to look at Lil’ Purple lying in the snow, and her face looked red. This naturally made him feel heartache, and he took out a purple blanket from his interspatial bracelet.

Just when he was about to cover her with it, Lil’ Purple happened to open her eyes and looked at Lin Yun. Seeing this, Lin Yun smiled awkwardly, “I was afraid that you might catch a cold.”

“Are you stupid? Have you seen an ice phoenix dying from the cold?” Lil’ Purple smiled.

This instantly placed Lin Yun in an awkward position.

“Hahaha! You’re hilarious! Snow is my territory, and you have no idea how comfortable I am lying in the snow.” Lil’ Purple laughed but soon snatched the blanket over and covered herself with it.

“What’s wrong!? Are you afraid of the cold?”

“Hmph!” Lil’ Purple’s face became red, and she argued, “That’s because this cape will remind me of how stupid you are!”

“It’s a blanket.”

“This is a cape!”

As time passed, nine days passed in the blink of an eye. During this time, Lil’ Purple taught him multiple songs, and she would get Lin Yun to practice the Phoenix Heart Song every day to temper his soul and nurture his musical sense.

The Phoenix Heart Song was the foundation, equivalent to sword sutras.

“You have mainly grasped all the songs I know, and you can play them from time to time, especially the Phoenix Heart Song. If you persevere, you will benefit greatly in the future.” Lil’ Purple finished, and she further reminded, “Remember not to casually play the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Score. It will cause a resonance with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. It’s a good thing if it’s in the past, but it will worsen the damage to your dragon pulses with your current state.”

“I’ll keep it in mind. But you know a lot of songs.” Lin Yun nodded.

“That’s for sure.” Lil’ Purple said proudly.

“Is there a song called Courting Phoenix?” Lin Yun asked.

“What is a scumbag like you planning?” Lil’ Purple’s face blushed, and she alertly looked at Lin Yun.

“So there really is one?” Lin Yun smiled. “I’m just wondering if the male courts the female or the other way around.”

“You idiot!” Lil’ Purple lost it and flicked her finger. Over the past few days, Lin Yun had taken a lot of beatings from her. Ever since she came back from the Myriad Demon Peak, her strength far surpassed Lin Yun’s, and he could no longer teach her a lesson like in the past.

In the end, Lil’ Purple explained it to Lin Yun. The phoenix was a primal divine beast born from primal chaos. It then used its blood to create the male and female phoenixes, and they were both considered divine beasts, regardless of their gender.

They were both considered part of the Divine Phoenix Clan, and there was only one true phoenix in this world. The true phoenix is undying and immortal.

“I see… So, can you teach me the song, Courting Phoenix?” Lin Yun asked, holding onto his chin.

“Why do you want to learn it? Behave well. We’re only left with the last day. I’ll be teaching you playing techniques this time, which are secret techniques of the Divine Phoenix Clan. Without them, it’s practically impossible for you to grasp the Saint Tone on the last day.” Lil’ Purple glared at Lin Yun.
