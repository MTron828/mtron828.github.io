Chapter 2457 - A Fight

“The Freezing Chill and Samsara Divine Runes?” Lil’ Purple asked the Black Emperor with excitement on his face.

Nodding his head, the Black Emperor said, “If I’m not wrong, the Nirvana Divine Rune should be in Flower Burial’s hand. I was the one who arranged the Southern Emperor’s real and fake tomb in the past, and I know that the Southern Emperor’s real tomb is in the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain.”

“It was done by you?! This is surprising that no one knew about it,” Lin Yun exclaimed.

“This fellow even hid it from me. So, how would anyone know about it?” The White Emperor replied.

“The Nirvana Divine Rune is with me.” Lin Yun took a deep breath and retrieved the painting with the Nirvana Divine Rune.

Lil’ Purple took it over and said excitedly, “Leave sealing the divine rune to me. This is great! The Phoenix Tree will grow again with all seven sovereign divine runes gathered. The secret realm can also reach the level of an immortal holy land! All the function will be recovered!”

Lil’ Purple was happy because she wanted to gather the runes, which were highly related to her strength and the Phoenix Tree.

“You’ll carry an immortal holy land on your back then. Do you know what that means? You’ll know when you see it!” Lil’ Purple said excitedly as she took the Iris Sword Box over from Lin Yun. The joy in her eyes couldn’t be concealed.

Carry a holy land on the back? The Black Emperor was shocked because he didn’t know such secrets. The White Emperor also nodded inwardly because he had guessed correctly; the Iris Sword Saint left the best inheritance for Lin Yun. Even he couldn’t help being envious of Lin Yun’s fortune now.

The White Emperor continued after recollecting his emotions, “The Iris Sword Saint has also given you the secret technique to slay deities, right?”

Lin Yun nodded upon hearing that.

“Great!” A cold light flashed across the White Emperor’s eyes. He looked at the Radiant Sword Emperor and asked, “What do you think of my plan? The Empress will hold the ceremony, and let’s have Lin Yun make a move on the ceremony. She has reached the Quasi-Deity Realm, possessing a hint of divinity. Even someone as strong as Yu Qingfeng couldn’t inflict heavy injuries on her, nor could he win everyone’s hearts. But if Lin Yun makes the move, he can sever the Empress’ divinity, and no one will support her then. Otherwise, she will stage a return as long as her divinity isn’t destroyed, and no one will dare to betray her.”

The Quasi-Deity Realm was a sensitive stage because this meant that she was only one step from becoming a deity. Now that she possessed a hint of divinity, Emperors couldn't slay a deity.

But Lin Yun didn’t seem bothered because if it was outside Kunlun Realm, the Qilin Sword Immortal could slay ordinary deities with his strength. But if it was in the Kunlun Realm, what the White Emperor said wasn’t wrong.

The Radiant Sword Emperor began to hesitate. This was a good plan, but Lin Yun was a disciple with whom he placed his hope, and letting him fight the Empress was the same as putting him in danger.

“Why don’t we wait till Lin Yun becomes an Emperor?” The Radiant Sword Emperor asked. “I have considered Guhan’s suggestion to combine the Sword Sect and Heavenly Dao Sect, avoiding a frontal clash with her for now.”

Since it was unavoidable for the Ancient Barren Dragon Vein to be seized, the best choice was to merge with the Heavenly Dao Sect.

The Black Emperor waved his hand and said, “You’re wrong with that. Lin Yun can’t become an Emperor.”

“What?” Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple were stumped upon hearing that; they were baffled. Why couldn’t Lin Yun become an Emperor?

The Radiant Sword Emperor was baffled as he looked at the Black Emperor. The latter explained, “If Flower Burial becomes an Emperor, he couldn’t step into the God Burial Mountain Range. The seal might weaken, but emperors can’t enter even if weakened. Lin Yun might be able to resolve the crisis in the God Burial Mountain Range as a Great Saint, but it would be impossible for him to enter if he reached the Emperor Realm.”

As this was crucial, the Black Emperor naturally had to explain it. The Empress couldn’t enter the God Burial Mountain Range, so she wanted to sacrifice a portion of people and reach the Deity Realm to reforge the Heavenly Path before resolving the crisis in the God Burial Mountain Range. If that were the case, there would be a battle between deities in the Kunlun Realm once more.

When the Black Emperor explained it, everyone fell into silence. The Black Emperor continued, “Back then, the Azure Dragon Lord destroyed the Heavenly Path because he didn’t want Kunlun Realm to become a battlefield among deities. But if Heavenly Path was reforged, wouldn’t that go against his wishes? It would be fine if we won, but there would be a crisis if we lost. I can’t hand our descendants' fate into the Empress's hands to gamble.”

Lin Yun said, “That’s the reason, but if we resolved the God Burial Mountain Range before reforging the Heavenly Path, new deities would be born in the Kunlun Realm. At that time, our odds of winning would be higher even if there was a battle between deities.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The sequence was important or reforging the Heavenly Path would become meaningless. The Radiant Sworrd Emperor soon understood the logic and no longer hesitated. He said, “Let’s go with that for now.”

“As for refining the divine runes, leave it to me. Whitey can become my assistant,” Lil’ Purple said.

The White Emperor was stumped upon hearing that, and he asked, “Wait, who’s whitey?”

When everyone’s eyes fell on him, the White Emperor became speechless that a little girl addressed him in this manner. But before he could refuse, the Black Emperor said, “I’ll help Flower Burial to refine the Heavenly Dragon Bone. There are many crucial points that you can’t be careless about.”

“Okay,” Lin Yun nodded and had no issue with that arrangement.

After coming to a decision, everyone began to make preparations. The Black Emperor and Lin Yun went to refine the Heavenly Dragon Bone, Lil’ Purple entered the secret realm to refine the divine runes, while the Radiant Sword Emperor and Yu Qingfeng headed to the Nether Palace. They went to look at the Dragon Suppression Monument before leaving in disappointment.

Since the Empress left without hesitation, she was confident that no one could resolve the restriction of the Dragon Suppression Monument. The monument had fused with the dragon vein completely, making it impossible to separate. They would have to destroy the dragon vein to resolve the restriction.

It was fine if it was untouched, but it would be troublesome if the Empress held the ceremony, extracting the dragon vein’s energy through a secret technique.

“There’s nothing we can do about it. They’re thoroughly fused, and we can only hope to defeat her in the ceremony to stop the dragon vein from being drained,” Yu Qingfeng sighed.

The Radiant Sword Emperor told Yu Qingfeng about the Black and White Emperor’s arrangement. He asked, “What do you think about it?”

“You can just call me Brother Qingfeng. No need to address me as sword emperor as it was just a title,” Yu Qingfeng smiled.

The Radiant Sword Emperor didn’t dwell on that and asked, “The plan is good, but I’m afraid Lin Yun might be unable to defeat her. Brother Qingfeng, what do you think about it?”

Yu Qingfeng pondered briefly and said, “The Nine Emperors’ inheritance came from the Iris Sword Saint or the inheritance of the Blue Dragon’s lineage. The Iris Sword Saint was the Blue Dragon Ancestral Lord’s disciple. If we didn’t have the inheritance, there would be no nine emperors.

“Since blacky and whitey are so confident, they must be confident that the Iris Sword Saint passed the best inheritance to Lin Yun, and he will surpass us.”

The Radiant Sword Emperor felt that something wasn’t right somewhere. He shook his head and said, “If you say that, you’ve belittled him. He didn’t just have the Iris Sword Saint’s inheritance, and I don’t see too many people’s figure on him.”

Yu Qingfeng’s eyes shone, and he smiled, “I share the same thought. To reach the Quasi-Deity Realm, you would need to shake off the inheritance the Iris Sword Saint left behind, which the Empress managed to accomplish. The White and Black Emperors weren’t able to do that. If Lin Yun only had the Iris Sword Saint’s inheritance, he might not have been able to defeat the Empress. But Lin Yun has already taken that step, and I can’t see anyone’s figure on him.”

He saw the fight between Lin Yun and Tian Xuanzi. Although he didn’t know what Lin Yun experienced in the Azure Sky Realm, the current Lin Yun gave him a feeling that he was a blank piece of paper without any doodles. He wasn’t anyone but just Flower Burial Lin Yun.

Yu Qingfeng smiled, “Let him do what he wants. I believe in him.”

He believed in Lin Yun without any hesitation. He didn’t tell the Radiant Sword Emperor he had seen Lin Yun’s performance outside Kunlun Realm. Even various divine sons were suppressed by him.

The Radiant Sword Emperor no longer dwells on that and says, “Don’t forget that there’s a battle between us.”

Yu Qingfeng looked at the Radiant Sword Emperor with a complicated gaze. He smiled, “I naturally remember. I’ve been waiting for you long, and I’m happy you can come this far. If there’s only one Sword Emperor in Kunlun Realm, I hope it will be you. Once Lin Yun refines the Heavenly Dragon Bone, come to the Skysolute City with him. I will fight you there.”

“Okay!” The Radiant Sword Emperor agreed.

“I’ll wait for you in the Skysolute City!” Yu Qingfeng laughed as he left.

The Radiant Sword Emperor looked at the direction Yu Qingfeng left in for a long time. He couldn’t see through Yu Qingfeng even after reaching the Emperor Realm. Aside from the nine emperors, the Radiant Sword Emperor’s eyesight was naturally high and unrivaled in the Kunlun Realm. The fact that he could defeat the Silver Dragon King and three holy lands’ emperors proved his strength.

Now that he also had the phenomenon of a myth, it was just a matter of him before he became a mythical emperor. But the Radiant Sword Emperor saw nothing impressive about the Black and White Emperors. There might be gaps between them, but the Radiant Sword Emperor was confident of catching or surpassing them.

But it was different for Yu Qingfeng because the Radiant Sword Emperor couldn’t see through him nor tell how far he had reached with his sword intent, even three thousand years later.

“Why do I feel that the gap between us increased instead of closing even after I became an Emperor?” The Radiant Sword Emperor muttered to himself. But he soon tossed it to the back of his mind. Rather than guessing here like a mindless fly, he preferred a fight.
