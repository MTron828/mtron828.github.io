Chapter 1791 - First on the Nirvana Banquet, First on the Dragon Pulse Ranking!

When Ji Lingfeng and others raised their heads, their pupils were filled with surprise. The Autumn Mountain Lord said in a shocked voice, “Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent? Wait… That’s already infinitely close to the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent!”

Lin Yun’s sword intent had broken through the limit of Firmament Sword Intent, and he was only one small step away from the Heavenly Dome Sword intent. If he had enough time, it was just a matter of time for him to grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

No matter what, Lin Yun’s sword intent already broke through the boundaries of the Firmament Sword Intent. To a certain degree, this was no different from the actual Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

Ao Feng was also briefly stunned for a moment before his face became eerie. He snorted, “Keep on pretending. That’s not the genuine Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, no matter what you do. Now, take an attack from me! Nethermoon Dragon Shattering Palm!”

The Nethermoon Saint Armor he wore flashed, and his speed reached a limit.

On the other hand, Lin Yun’s Sword Heart managed to accurately catch onto Ao Feng’s trajectory. He lowered his center of gravity and began to start accumulating his power.

Before Ao Feng even reached him, just the strong wind alone made Lin Yun’s hair flutter, and his black hair was like a waterfall under the powerful gale.

Lin Yun had delicate features, and he looked like a celestial wielding a sword in a painting with stars and moons within his pupils. When Ao Feng reached above him in a split second, he gently pressed his palm down, and the blood radiance from him manifested into a full moon. His palm looked like a gigantic palm extending out of the moon.

Blood radiance seeped out from the gap between his fingers, like a firework stretching more than a few hundred meters. Lin Yun and Ao Feng were like two gods, forming a bizarre picture. As a majestic aura swept out, the surrounding wind and time seemed to have stopped, and the two of them were imprinted in a painting.

“Die!” Ao Feng roared, and his palm descended from the sky.

“Break!” Lin Yun finally moved after accumulating his sword for a long time. He executed the Azure Dragon Sword Art—Unrivaled•Thunderstorm Slash.

Lin Yun split into two, and each swung a sword. As two sword rays intertwined and reached a hundred feet, they came in contact with Ao Feng’s palm. When the two ultimate moves collided, the surroundings became quiet, and everyone couldn’t hear anything. They could only see the painting distorting, and a chaotic shockwave sweep out.

A long time later, the boundless blood flames immediately detonated the mixture of energy. Simultaneously, four sword rays sliced the powerful air current into four like a piece of beancurd.

In the next moment, the frozen world began to move, and a loud explosion echoed. In the blink of an eye, the majestic power swept out, reaching as far as ten miles away in radius. But fortunately, there was a barrier created by the dragon spirit or the stage would shatter on the spot. Even so, it still created a terrifying phenomenon in the sky.

Ao Feng was knocked flying away and fell onto the ground once more. There were two obvious sword marks on his Nethermoon Saint Armor, and that region on the armor had slightly collapsed.

Although the Flower Burial Sword failed to break through the Nethermoon Saint Armor, it didn’t make Ao Feng feel good. Ao Feng had rage on his face and felt that his dignity was seriously being challenged. After all, he swept through his opponents just a moment ago, so this instantly caused waves of aura to erupt from him.

On the other hand, Lin Yun gently landed on the ground with the Flower Burial Sword. He furrowed his brows while looking at Ao Feng because the Nethermoon Saint Armor’s defensive capabilities far exceeded his expectations. “I can’t break through?”

The power of the Unrivaled•Thunderstorm Slash was terrifying, and it was Lin Yun’s strongest attack, aside from the Divine Firefly Sword. From a certain aspect, it was even stronger because his Azure Dragon Intent was at the fifth grade, and it could greatly strengthen his Azure Dragon Sword Art.

Stomping his foot hard on the ground, Ao Feng calmed the turbulent energy within his body. He coldly said, “You’re worthy of being the strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. You can be proud of forcing me to this step. But… Let’s put an end to this now! The Nethermoon Saint Armor is invincible at the Dragon Pulse Realm, and I’ll let you experience the true power of a Glory Saint Artifact!”

Ji Lingfeng and the others furrowed their brows because Ao Feng was too arrogant, claiming to be invincible whenever he spoke. The three of them still have yet to make a move, and they wouldn’t even bat an eye at Ao Feng and Yan Cangming if they didn’t have the Nethermoon Saint Armor. But they had to admit that the Nethermoon Saint Armor was strong.

When Ao Feng finished speaking, he formed a seal with his hand. When he was done forming the seal, he roared, “First seal of the Nethermoon Saint Armor, break!”

His body suddenly tensed up, and a terrifying aura swept out from the Nethermoon Saint Armor. When that aura erupted, the saint runes on the armor glowed red, and his aura turned into glittering blood wisps. This made the sky change, and a moon appeared in the sky.

At this moment, the sky became dark, with only the blood moon shining brightly. Dragon pulses also began to appear behind him and swiftly grew in size before reaching a heaven-defying size of six thousand feet.

“This…” The faces of Ji Lingfeng and the others changed, with surprise in their eyes. As for the others in the top ten, they were completely dumbfounded because their dragon pulses were already at the limit after reaching three thousand feet. But Ao Feng reached six thousand feet after relying on the Nethermoon Saint Armor, and this was nearly twice the size of everyone else’s.

“Die!” After Ao Feng lifted the first seal on the Nethermoon Saint Armor, he charged towards Lin Yun.

Under the immense aura that he gave off, Lin Yun could only retreat with his sword aura constantly receiving blows, and he was barely defending against Ao Feng’s attacks with the Flower Burial Sword.

But the impacts were too great, not to mention the devour power became even more terrifying that he was struggling to hold on even with the Blue Dragon Bone.

“Hahaha! Lin Xiao, weren't you arrogant earlier?” Ao Feng roared with his eyes turning red.

But Lin Yun ignored him and used his Sword Heart to detect the weakness in Ao Feng’s attacks while barely holding his ground. Ten moves later, Lin Yun’s sword aura almost crumbled, and everyone on the Thunderblood Square exclaimed.

Everyone knew that once a swordsman’s sword aura collapsed, they wouldn’t be far from being defeated. That was especially the case for Lin Yun. The difference in their cultivation was huge, and Lin Yun would be instantly defeated if he didn’t have his sword intent to bridge the gap between them. If Lin Yun wasn’t careful, he might even be killed by Ao Feng.

“Ha!” The Wind Edge Lord’s pupils flashed with a ruthless light, and the corner of his lips couldn’t help curling up. He was naturally the happiest amongst everyone to see this scene.

“Champion of the Nirvana Banquet, don’t you possess the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent? Why don’t you use it? Hahaha!” Ao Feng started mocking when he saw that victory was already in his pocket, venting all the anger he had pent up from being suppressed by Lin Yun earlier.

He was confident that Lin Yun didn’t grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, and his pupils radiated with mockery.

“Alright.” Lin Yun nodded his head, and his gaze became sharp before Ao Feng could react. Slowly raising the Flower burial Sword in his hand, he raised his sword to the same level as his eyes.

Simultaneously, Lin Yun unleashed his dual sword souls, and they emitted a dazzling golden brilliance. When the two sword souls merged with his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, they flew out from his brows and merged with the Flower Burial Sword.

In the next second, a dazzling golden radiance shone from Lin Yun and shot to the sky. When the beam of light pierced into the sky, it formed a massive vortex that tore the sky apart, isolating the aura coming from Ao Feng.

At the same time, almost all the swordsmen at Thunderblood Square lost control of their swords and flew towards Lin Yun.

“My sword!”

“What the hell is going on?!”

“...” Only the powerful swordsmen could suppress their swords from flying away. As thousands of saint swords coiled around the beam of light, they soared to the sky and were like birds worshipping their lord. That was the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, and it was said that it was impossible to grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Yan Tie, Shi Feng, and the Cloud Swordsman were shocked as they rose to their feet. They were speculating if Lin Yun grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. But when they saw this scene, they couldn’t conceal their shock.

As for Ji Lingfeng and others, they were completely dumbfounded because they were suffering a huge impact in their hearts. When Lin Yun thrust his sword forth, his sword sliced apart the three thousand blood wisps, breaking through the defenses of the Nethermoon Saint Armor and creating a hole.

When sparks flew from the Nethermoon Saint Armor, fresh blood poured out and dyed the ground red. Ao Feng was sent flying away and rolled on the ground. His face was terrifyingly pale without a strand of blood.

“Back!” Lin Yun pulled his sword back, looking exhausted with his body swaying lightly. But he still stood firmly on the ground.

Everyone at Thunderblood Square suffered a huge impact on their hearts when they looked at Lin Yun, and their hearts were trembling. This was too powerful because that sword earlier gave Lin Yun an invincible demeanor.

“Hahaha! No wonder he’s the strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking! Impressive!”

“Looks like everyone still has to rely on swordsmen like us, after all.”

“This is the grace of a swordsman! When Jian Jingtian was first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, he probably wouldn’t be any stronger.”

“It looks like swordsmen like us are still the ones who have the final say on the Dragon Pulse Ranking!” All the swordsmen present were so excited, it was as though they were the ones who were defeating Ao Feng.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“First on the Nirvana Banquet, first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking!” A burst of laughter roared, which sounded like music to their ears.

Ji Lingfeng and others lightly furrowed their brows. When they looked at where the voice came from, they realized that Mei Zihua was here without anyone knowing it, sitting on a pavilion while laughing and holding a jar of wine.
