Chapter 556 - Solar Slash

At the foot of the Spiritwood Peak, Lin Yun ran into Mo Ling. He instantly greeted her, “What a coincidence, Senior Sister.”

“It’s not a coincidence. I’m here for you. Did you see that girl Mu Xue?” asked Mo Ling.

Lin Yun nodded. He turned to look at the Spiritwood Peak and asked, “Senior Sister, do you think that this mountain is high?”

“There’s always a higher mountain,” said Mo Ling.

“Then how vast is the sky?” asked Lin Yun.

“There’s always a sky beyond one,” replied Mo Ling.

“That’s right, there’s always something better in the world,” smiled Lin Yun. Only time would tell who the frog in the well was.

With Mo Ling’s meticulous mind, she naturally guessed what happened. However, she was never good at comforting someone. She suddenly took out a delicate box and handed it to Lin Yun, “This is the fourth grade pellet that the dean refined for you. It is called the Yin-Yang Jadecloud Pellet.”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up and he smiled, “I nearly forgot about it.”

“I didn’t. So I’ve been waiting. Also, here’s the spiritual artifact that I promised you.” Mo Ling gently tapped her interspatial pouch and retrieved nine short swords.

The nine swords didn’t have any handles and they could be combined together according to the user’s will. The nine short swords could also be combined together to form a python-like blade. However, it wasn’t limited to just this and had many other forms. At the same time, there were ice attributed spiritual runes engraved on the swords.

“This is based on a famous spiritual artifact from ancient times. Its called Snowmoon Petals. The original was made up of sixteen crescent blades, but this is just an imitation. Although it’s a copy, it is still powerful. It’s not inferior in any way to mine. What do you think?” Mo Ling explained as she controlled the nine swords.

Lin Yun examined it briefly and replied, “It’s truly extraordinary. But I’m still used to swinging swords. Flower Burial is enough for me.”

Mo Ling didn’t force it as she put away the nine swords. Then she spoke up, “The Five Academies Competition will begin in ten days. I’ll come fetch you then.”

Lin Yun nodded his head as Mo Ling departed. Then, he fell into deep thought. He made great leaps in his cultivation, but there wasn’t any progress in his marital techniques. He had even felt signs that they were dragging him down. But ten days was more than enough for him to improve his comprehension in the Seven Slaughtering Fist and Overlord Sword.

“Let’s go with the fist technique first.” The Seven Slaughtering Fist was easier than the Overlord Sword. There were seven styles to the Seven Slaughtering Fist: Omnipresent Anger, Raging Sky, Defiant Frustration, Resonance, Heartless Injustice, Bleeding Battle, and Endless Slaughter.

Each style, especially the last three, was powerful. Each one of them could be considered a forbidden technique and there was no fist technique that could be compared to it among earth grades. In fact, it was only comparable to heaven grades.

If he could learn the first four styles, he would be invincible among the Violet Palace Realm. If he could practice them into complete mastery, then he could travel throughout the Ancient Southern Domain as he wished. Then, his name would definitely be on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

Lin Yun prepared himself for a long time before he started practicing in the courtyard. In the blink of an eye, five days had passed as he practiced his martial technique. He worked on this as if he didn’t know the meaning of exhaustion.

Forming the Seven Slaughtering Seal instantly, a boundless killing aura began to gush out from his body. As he threw out a punch, the terrifying power of the Seven Slaughtering Fist exploded and caused the sky to change. His fist intent had caused a complete transformation to his temperament. If someone was here to watch, they would have the misconception that Lin Yun was a lofty mountain.

His fist was equivalent to the charge of an army, filled with war cries that shook heaven and earth. The boundless killing aura covered Lin Yun in sweat and his frail body was having difficulty bearing it.

Defiant Frustration, Resonance! Lin Yun yelled inwardly as he threw a punch out, shattering the third grade spiritual array that fortified the field. As cracks began to spread out, Lin Yun relaxed his fists and muttered to himself, “The four styles are domineering and violent, but they’re actually just accumulating my killing aura and rage. Upon reaching the limit, using the last three styles will be equivalent to a heaven grade forbidden technique!”

But it was a pity that he had reached the limit of his physique and cultivation. If he used the last three moves, then his physique might even explode. In just five days, Lin Yun had completed what everyone in the academy couldn’t for the past few centuries by bringing the Seven Slaughtering Fist to near greater mastery.

At the same time, he noticed that there was something incomplete about this technique. There was something lacking that the seniors of the academy who practiced this technique hadn’t noticed. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be passed down. The disciples of the academy couldn’t practice it because they couldn’t handle the killing aura. However, this was probably another reason why the technique was available.

But fortunately, this technique ran into Lin Yun. In just five days, not only did Lin Yun succeed in practicing it, but he also comprehended the intent contained in this technique.

“With my Seven Slaughtering Fist, I can show those overlord forces’ disciples how big the world is.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he looked at the field. If someone were to look at him, they would surely feel a chill run down their spine.

“Time to work on my sword technique.” Lin Yun waved his hand and summoned the Flower Burial Sword from the sword box. When he held onto it, the Flower Burial Sword had merged perfectly with his temperament.

His eyes were clear and he could feel a deep connection with the Flower Burial Sword. When he drew the sword, a sword buzz echoed out. When he raised the sword to the same level as his eye, it felt like he was overlooking the land from a high spot.

When Lin Yun swung the sword, moonlight was reflected from the sword as it scattered into the surroundings. Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as his eyes blazed with flames from inside his pupils. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slasher!

Thunderclouds began to gather in the sky as they formed a dragon that entered his body. In the next second, a terrifying bolt of lightning flew out when Lin Yun swung his sword, leaving a massive crater in the ground.

Overlord Sword—Solar Slash!

Boundless domineering aura gathered from the surroundings as cracks began to appear on the wall and swiftly spread out. Compared to the Thunderbolt Slasher, this attack was a lot faster. It was majestic like the sun, but it didn’t seem to be as powerful as Lin Yun had imagined it would be.

Shaking his head, Lin Yun muttered to himself, “The Solar Slash is still lacking a lot. I have to comprehend the intent that is contained within this technique. What other profundities are there in this style aside from being fast?”
