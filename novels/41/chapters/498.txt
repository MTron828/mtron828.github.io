Before Liu Yunyan could think about it, the two demonic apes and the one who fell into the lake, charged at the Heavenly Province Academy’s party. The three demonic apes looked like three mountains when they ran. Their terrifying aura instantly linked together, causing the lake water to surge into the air.

The Indigocloud Lake’s water was a mixture of lightning and flame, so it was terrifying. The wave was like a majestic volcano pouring over.

This scene made Lin Yun and Liu Yunyan’s faces change. They didn’t expect that the demonic apes would be so terrifying. Without any hesitation, they launched their attacks all at once.

“Four combined seals!” Lin Yun formed the four seals with a grave expression as he released an aura that wasn’t any inferior to the lesser Yin stage. When his origin energy combined with his terrifying strength, Lin Yun was like a volcano that was about to erupt.

“Frost Star!” Liu Yunyan began to glow like stars as she chopped down like a sword. The combined attacks of Lin Yun and Liu Yunyan destroyed the torrential wave. However, before they could rejoice, the three demonic apes had arrived.

“Kill!” The Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples all launched their attacks to tie up the three demonic apes. The disciples were already fighting with demonic beasts, so they didn’t dare to let the demonic apes come over.

With Liu Yunyan and Lin Yun’s strength, it was more than enough for them to kill the three demonic apes. But they needed time to do it and they couldn’t help that they were being held up.

“Those two are rather strong, but the three demonic apes are more than enough to hold them up. They’re still lacking too much to compete with us,” said Pan Yue coldly as he turned around.

Leng Yi also threw a glance over and wore a sinister smile, “Let’s deal with those two later. We have to deal with Ye Cangming right now. His Bloodcloud Sword Art gives me a headache.”

Even someone like Leng Yi was fearful of Ye Cangming’s strength.

Pan Yue shook his head, “He’s alone by himself. He might be strong, but can he escape even if he snatches the Indigoflame Goldlotuses? Pay more attention to the Threesolute Manor’s Han Fei and Shattered Sword Pavilion’s Nie Feng…”

Right at this moment, a sword buzz rang out as a terrifying sword intent swept into the surroundings. It was a quasi-xiantian sword intent, which made Pan Yue and Leng Yi’s faces change. They directed their gazes over and saw an elite Violet Palace Realm demonic beast being severed into two as a person grabbed onto the demonic beasts’ beast core. Then, that person shot towards the center of the lake like a bolt of lightning.

“Ye Cangming!” Pan Yue and Leng Yi both exclaimed. They could see Ye Cangming turning back to look at them with mockery on his face.

“Chase after him!” Pan Yue and Leng Yi’s faces sank because they knew they had been fooled. They spent a great deal of effort to deal with the Heavenly Province Academy, but this benefited Ye Cangming instead. The two then chased after Ye Cangming at their top speed.

“That fellow’s quasi-xiantian sword intent is more terrifying now…” Nie Feng’s eyes looked cautious as he yelled, “Cover me!”

The Shattered Sword Pavilion’s disciples all attacked at once. Their aura was like a mountain that crashed into the two elite Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts.

When there was an opening, Nie Feng turned into a bolt of lightning as he shot over. His eyes blazed with fighting spirit as he charged at the Indigoflame Goldlotuses. On the other side, Han Fei also broke free from the group under the cover of the Threesolute Manor’s disciples.

Right at this moment, anyone who could break free from the demonic beasts was now charging at the center of the lake. They only had one goal at this moment, the Indigoflame Goldlotuses.

“Damn it!” Liu Yunyan was furious. She was furious that they were being held up by three Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts because of the Bloodwing Pavilion. She couldn’t break free anytime soon.

“Lin Yun, cover me. There’s no other way now. We’ll be late if we’re hindered even more,” said Liu Yunyan with a grave expression. Although it might be tough for Lin Yun to deal with the three demonic beasts by himself, she didn’t have any choice right now.

“Liu Yunyan, you cover me instead!” Lin Yun placed his hand on Liu Yunyan’s shoulder and pulled her back just when she was about to make her move.

Liu Yunyan recovered from her shock and asked, “Lin Yun, what are you trying to do?”

“I’m not used to hiding behind a woman. Just wait here. I’ll get the Indigoflame Goldlotuses you need, but remember your end of the bargain,” said Lin Yun with a bright smile on his face. Before Liu Yunyan could react, Lin Yun turned into a golden beam as he shot past the three demonic apes.

“This fellow…” Liu Yunyan gnashed her teeth. Demonic beasts might be terrifying, but it wasn’t more dangerous than fighting for the Indigoflame Goldlotuses. This was also the reason why Liu Yunyan wanted Lin Yun to stay behind. But she never imagined that Lin Yun would charge through forcibly.

Seeing that the demonic apes’ attacks were about to land on Lin Yun, Liu Yunyan was ultimately forced to attack, “Frost Blossom!”

An ice flower bloomed in the sky and the sword in Liu Yunyan’s hand lit up. Just when Lin Yun was about to give up, a cold sword ray hacked over.

“Thanks.” Lin Yun turned around and gave Liu Yunyan a wink. He had finally broken free of the demonic apes’ encirclement. When he landed on the surface of the lake, the Golden Crow Seal behind him lit up and his speed increased. He had already reached the Manifestation Stage in the Seven Profound Steps. So it didn’t take long for him to catch up to those that were ahead.

Suddenly, eight cold gales that contained domineering saber intent shot towards him.

Soaring Dragon!

Lin Yun didn’t even turn back and unleashed nine dragons. When he clenched his fist, the nine dragons gathered in his fist and he threw a punch out. His punch swept through and destroyed the eight cold gales coming at him. “Get lost!”

The eight who attacked were from the Threesolute Manor. They were under Han Fei’s orders to stop anyone who tried to fight for the Indigoflame Goldlotuses.

“Flies.” The smile on Lin Yun’s face disappeared and was replaced by frost. He spread his arms apart and then dashed forward like a golden crow. He arrived at the eight in the next second with an ancient seal blooming on his chest. In the next second, he was shrouded in the dracophant flames.

Lin Yun was filled with power from the sword energy and blazing dracophant energy within his body. When he arrived before the eight, he threw his punch out like a sword.

“Courting death!” The eight were enraged to see Lin Yun coming at them. In the next second, they all unleashed their ultimate moves, but their attacks collapsed the moment they came in contact with Lin Yun’s fist. The immense power coming from the punch sent them flying out as they threw up a huge mouthful of blood. When they fell onto the lake, they could no longer fight anymore.

“He’s that powerful?”

“Who the hell is he and where did he come from?!”

“I heard that he’s called Flower Burial. Even the Nethercloud Ghost’s disciple suffered in his hand.” Everyone’s opinion of Lin Yun changed when they saw how he defeated the disciples from the Threesolute Manor.

“Stop him!” Even Han Fei, Pan Yue, and the rest couldn’t help turning back with shock in their eyes. Even they couldn’t defeat the eight with a single punch, but Lin Yun had done it easily.

“How the hell did he do that?” Liu Yunyan was also shocked when she saw this scene. But before she could rejoice, more people started to charge towards Lin Yun. They were the disciples from the Bloodwing Pavilion, Threesolute Manor, and Shattered Sword Pavilion. This made Liu Yunyan’s face change because no one could fight against that many people, not to mention that even she would be killed if she was encircled by them.

“You guys really think highly of me. But do you guys think you guys can stop me?” The Iris Flower started to bloom within Lin Yun’s dantian. At the same time, he pressed his palm down at the lake. His action was slow and more people charged at him.

The sword energy flowed like a river in his palm and when the surrounding disciples came within a hundred meter radius, his palm finally landed on the surface of the lake. He was unleashing the Great Wind Scripture.

In the next second, heaven and earth began to tremble. The lake water within a thousand meters sank down without any signs and the surrounding disciples fell down before they could even react. When they fell onto the lake water, they were knocked back up by an even more domineering method.

Howls sounded out in the surroundings while Lin Yun soared into the sky with his arms spread apart. Before Pan Yue and the others that were in the front could react, a figure dashed across the sky and landed before them. When that figure landed on the surface of the water, a tsunami was released into the surroundings.

This made everyone’s faces change as they unleashed their attacks at the tsunami. When the tsunami settled down, they saw a figure standing before them. This covered everyone’s faces with disbelief.

“Flower Burial?!” frowned Nie Feng.

“Since you know my name, why are you still here?” Lin Yun turned around with a smile on his face. He looked at everyone coldly as if he was looking at them from the sky.
