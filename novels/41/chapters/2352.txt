Chapter 2353 - Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron

When Lin Yun and his group arrived, they were looking at the cultivators who made it through the first stage of the test.

“It looks like many Divine Clans are here... so we better keep a low profile.”

“That’s for sure. Geniuses from the various Divine Clans can easily make it through the first stage.”

“There are also many people from the immortal holy lands, and many other experts here.”

“They’re all looking at Flower Burial!” Everyone became nervous as they talked. Compared to the first stage, the second stage was quieter, but there were too many experts here. Anyone could sense uneasiness from the surroundings, so they lowered their voices when they talked.

“Look, Shangguan Jue is also here!”

“He’s the one who obtained three Flame Origin Pellets, right? He’s examining Lin Yun...”

“Shangguan Jue is a divine disciple of the Shadow Divine Palace. The Shadow Divine Palace spans over a hundred realms, and they have a high position in the Divine Alliance. They’re stronger than the Divine Clans.”

“If he stands out, the situation won’t become great.” Noticing that Shangguan Jue was examining Lin Yun, the swordsmen who came with Lin Yun became nervous.

In reality, Shangguan Jue was unhappy because Lin Yun stole all the limelight. Everyone had gathered on Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain, wanting to become the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity’s disciple. But they also wanted fame, especially when the two weren’t conflicting. So, who knew if the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity was observing their performances?

“I thought a divine son had appeared.”

“There are many geniuses here, even chief disciples from immortal holy lands. So it’s impossible to keep a low profile.” Zhao Zhanli, a divine disciple of the Shadow Divine Palace, smiled with disdain in his tone.

Shangguan Jue smiled, “He’s not a pushover, fighting seven by himself and digging out seven saint origins. Even in the Shadow Divine Palace, he’s worthy of being a divine disciple.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Don’t be so sure about that. If anyone can withstand his Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent, one's cultivation can suppress him to death. Furthermore, he has a huge weakness,” Zhao Zhanli smiled contemptuously.

“Oh?” Shangguan Jue looked at Zhao Zhanli in puzzlement.

Zhao Zhanli smiled, “He didn’t release his constellation, so it should be his greatest weakness. Otherwise... he wouldn’t have to use his trump cards, the nine thousand ribbons.”

“That might really be possible,” Shangguan Jue replied. He had been paying attention to Lin Yun. He wasn’t bothered initially, but he was only slightly shocked after seeing how Lin Yun defeated the seven from the Divine Clans. But when he saw how Lin Yun obtained three Flame Origin Pellets with a wave of his hand, his mindset finally changed.

But after hearing what Zhao Zhanli said, Shangguan Jue inwardly rejoiced because Lin Yun wasn’t qualified to compete with him, if that was true. While everyone’s gazes were attracted by Lin Yun, a giant cauldron descended from the sky.

When everything settled down, everyone’s attention shifted to the cauldron. When the cauldron descended, there was a grey-robed elder. That old man’s face was covered with wrinkles and an ancient aura swept from him. Just a glance made everyone feel as though their souls were about to be devoured by him.

The grey-clothed elder indifferently said, “This is the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, given to us by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity. The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity personally forged this cauldron, and it was forged using the Primal Chaos Eternal Sand. The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity spent a thousand years refining it, and the cauldron contains countless daos. You can benefit from it no matter which dao you practice. The test of this stage involves comprehension, and the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity hid ten thousand phenomena in it, each being a painting. Each painting represents a transcendent grade dragon spirit martial technique. You can make it through this test if you can find nine.”

“Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity!”

“I have heard of this cauldron before. It appears during the disciple conferring ceremony in order to test them.”

“This cauldron is weird. Aside from phenomena, I've heard that it contains various dao flames and even Glory Saint Artifacts.”

“It’s so much so that a Sovereign Saint Artifact has appeared before!”

“It’s actually here on Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain. It looks like the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity is serious this time.”

When the old man finished speaking, a considerable commotion was sparked amongst the crowd. Everyone had heard of this cauldron before.

Lin Jiangxian’s expression became serious, and even Xiong Tiannan wore a grave expression.

“Holy shit, it’s the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. I didn’t expect that we could also see it!” Ao Jue was shocked. The Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron was a secret, the supreme treasure of Heaven’s Gate that even divine disciples couldn’t frequently comprehend.

Lin Yun was also surprised because he never expected to see this. It was even related to the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity.

Shangguan Jue’s eyes lit up with excitement. He was confident in his comprehension, and even the chief disciple of an immortal holy land wouldn’t be able to win against him. This was because he was lucky when he was young, obtaining a secret treasure, the Eye of Destiny. He only needed a few glances to comprehend all martial techniques and could easily reach complete mastery in them.

Seeing this, Zhao Zhanli frowned, “This seems to be prepared for him.”

“What do you mean?” Shangguan Jue asked.

“Since he can grasp the Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent, his comprehension isn’t weak. Although I don’t wish to admit it, his attainment in the sword is heaven-defying. Aside from divine sons from Sword Dao holy lands, I’ve never seen anyone stronger than him.”

Shangguan Jue smiled mysteriously, before he looked at the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. He said, “This isn’t a competition of Sword Dao, but purely on comprehension.”

Beside the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, the grey-clothed elder said, “This stage will last for some time, so everyone can try and comprehend it. You can bring out any martial techniques you have comprehended, and you’re also not restricted from teaching others. That’s the same if you can obtain a treasure.”

A commotion resounded from the surroundings because dragon spirit martial techniques were valuable and could be used till the Emperor Realm. It was only inferior to divine martial techniques, and it would be a massive contribution if they could bring it back to their sect. Secondly, this stage tested comprehension, and there was enough time for everyone to comprehend.

Treasures can be taken out? Lin Yun was surprised since there must be many treasures in the Blue Dragon Divine cauldron, and it wasn’t surprising to see divine-grade pellets. He had to admit that this test was really generous.

When he raised his head, he noticed that the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron was close to a hundred feet, but there didn't seem to be anything on it. However, if he looked at it closely, he could see that something was

on it. There were divine runes containing profundity, and he would have a harvest if he continued to observe them.

“It’s similar to the Sovereign Monument... but not entirely the same,” Lin Yun said. The Sovereign Monument could drag someone into an illusory world, and anyone could obtain some dao fruits if they comprehended it. But he could see some pictures on the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron.

As Lin Yun poured his sword intent into his eyes, a golden light shone from his eyes. But the light was different and looked like an ancient golden seal, just a little blurred. This was the Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent, and the rune would form entirely after he grasped the complete Bright Sun Sword Intent.

When he poured his sword intent into his eyes, the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron immediately became different and he saw a massive starry sky with primal chaos at the center. When his gaze came in contact with the primal chaos, it became the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. When his gaze came in contact with the cauldron, he suffered a colossal obstruction and couldn’t see anything.

Lin Yun frowned and recollected his gaze. Many people shared the same experience as Lin Yun, and some couldn’t even get close to the primal chaos.

“Time is sovereign, and space is king. Primal chaos cannot be opened, and it’s hard to extinguish karma. Truth is eternal, Yin-Yang as the sky, and five elements as earth...” Lin Jiangxian recollected her gaze after also running into trouble.

When Lin Yun wanted to try with Nirvana Dao, two figures came over. This immediately made Ao Jue and Lin Jiangxian nervous.

When Lin Yun turned his head over, the one on the left smiled, “My name is Shangguan Jue!”

This instantly drew everyone’s attention, and Lin Yun nodded as respond.

“Brother Lin, what do you think?” Shangguan Jue smiled. He had an extraordinary temperament, and his smile was charming. He was expressing goodwill, which left Lin Yun surprised.

With no change on his face, Lin Yun said, “It’s hard.”

Shangguan Jue smiled, “That’s for sure. The Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron was forged with Eternal Sand and primal chaos. So, how can anyone see through it? But...”

He paused with a smile and said nothing as he looked at Lin Yun.

“Judging from your tone, you already have a harvest?” Lin Jiangxian asked.

“Not exactly,” Shangguan Jue didn’t deny or admit it. He smiled, “Brother Lin, are you interested in taking a bet and seeing who can observe more phenomena?”

Lin Yun fell silent, having no idea what Shangguan Jue was planning.

Beside Shangguan Jue, Zhao Zhanli smiled, “Don’t you want to reforge the glory of the Kunlun Realm? Don’t tell me you don’t have that much courage before the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, right? The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity forged it, which should have a significant meaning to you!”

His tone was calm, but it was filled with provocation.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned, before he asked, “What do you want to bet?”

Shangguan Jue smiled, “Let’s go with the Golden Dao Fruits. If I lose, you can have the three Flame Origin Pellets. Three for one, it’s fair, right?”

Lin Yun fell into silence upon hearing that.

“What’s the matter? Don’t tell me that you don’t even have that much courage?” Zhao Zhanli pursued. “If you accept it, I can bet with my Flame Origin Pellets.”

Lin Yun smiled, and honestly said, “I can agree to the bet if it was with something else, but I don’t have any more Golden Dao Fruits on me. Unless you want to be like Gu Jun and have your saint origin dug out?”

He looked at Shangguan Jue and Zhao Zhanli with a playful smile and showed no fear, even when facing two divine disciples.

What he said made Zhao Zhanli and Shangguan Jue’s faces changed because Lin Yun had a strong stance, wanting to intimidate them.

“Big Brother Lin, I have a Golden Dao Fruit,” Ji Zixi said as she stepped forth.
