Chapter 2171: Lin Yun and Tian Xuanzi

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, the laughter disappeared, and the surroundings returned to normal. But when he closed his eyes again, the laughter resounded again, except it was a laughter belonging to a man this time, “This is weird.”

The laughter was hearty and repeated a few times. Then Lin Yun finally figured it out, the laughter came from the surrounding hovering pagodas. Lin Yun shook his head and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, devoting himself to his cultivation.

Not long later, the thirty-six pagodas shone brightly with the world becoming dark and the Dao Comprehending Stage looked as though it was hovering in the universe. Multiple figures began to fly out from those pagodas, which should be the sword spirits that his senior brother spoke of.

Each sword spirit had grasped countless sword techniques and they entered his sea of consciousness to fight him. Sometimes, it would be a one-to-one battle. At times, they would gang up on him, and Lin Yun was fully submerged in the teachings or simply getting beaten. He didn’t know how much time had passed, but the radiance released from the pagodas began to dim down like candles being extinguished.

“It looks like that brat is pretty popular to have so many sword spirits communicating with him,” Ye Guhan smiled.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes again, his eyes were dull, and he felt dizzy. He felt as though he had a long dream with many people bringing him along to explore space. There were mysterious planets, celestial palaces, ancient palaces, and towering mountains. He even saw a sea coiling around a planet, and there were also monsters even bigger than planets.

He even saw many pure-blooded divine beasts, which was a magical experience. He grasped many sword techniques through exploration along with many experiences. But when he tried to think about them now, he couldn’t recall them no matter how he tried. Those experiences felt real, but they were vague in his memories.

“Was that a dream?” Lin Yun was shocked to discover that his Astral Sword Intent had improved, and the number of galaxies increased to a thousand. The dual sword stars also returned to the size of a fist, but they were shining brightly with the sun becoming a golden gem, while the moon became a silver gem.

They had shrunk in size, but they were shining even more brightly than before. The actual appearances of the sword stars couldn’t be seen since they were overshadowed by the dazzling radiance.

“That’s not a dream?” Lin Yun was shocked. He could sense that his sword intent was ten times stronger than before, and the dual sword stars had undergone a transformation.

“You’re awake?” Ye Guhan looked at Lin Yun with a smile.

“Senior Brother, what’s going on? Was that a dream?” Lin Yun asked.

Ye Guhan replied, “It’s a dream, but it’s not a dream at the same time. Those sword spirits merely brought you over to experience what they went through. Just that…”

Ye Guhan briefly paused before he smiled, “It’s just that too many sword spirits took a fancy to you, so your dream was a little too long. Judging from your looks, the dream was at least a hundred years.

“As expected of my junior brother to be so likeable,” Ye Guhan smiled as he caressed Lin Yun’s head.

“Senior Brother, that’s enough…” Lin Yun didn’t dare to refute that, fearing that he might put his senior brother in an awkward situation.

“Haha, I can’t help myself.” Ye Guhan smiled. As he raised his head to look at Lin Yun’s sword stars, he continued, “It’s not bad that your sword stars have condensed into starite. This way, even a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase might not be able to destroy your sword intent. You can no longer improve your sword intent, but you can condense more galaxies to increase the pressure.”

Lin Yun understood what his senior brother meant. He could only improve his sword intent in quantity and not quality. He asked, “What’s the seventh-grade sword intent?”

“There's no need to hurry. Take it one step at a time. After experiencing a dream of a hundred years, your sword intent is strong enough, and your cultivation has consolidated. It’s time for you to reach the Indigo Origin Phase and grasp the saint dao now,” Ye Guhan smiled.

“Are… they still alright?” Lin Yun looked at the surrounding pagodas and asked. He had an ill premonition for some reason.

“They’re alright, they’re only asleep,” Ye Guhan said.

Lin Yun’s heart trembled as he looked at the pagodas. In his dream, they were his friends and companions who experienced life and death together. Although he couldn’t remember them now, he still had feelings for them, and he couldn’t accept it. So he just considered them to be asleep…

“Start comprehending dao.” Ye Guhan patted Lin Yun’s shoulder, before he continued, “The Eternal Daos, Sovereign Daos, three thousand Greater Daos, and over ten thousand Lesser Daos are waiting for you. You don’t have to rush with the Eternal Daos and Sovereign Daos. Your main focus should be on the Wind Dao and Thunder Dao. The Azure Dragon Divine Physique controls wind and lightning, so it’s easy for you to grasp them. As for Lesser Daos, let nature take its course and see how many you can grasp.

“Let me manifest dao for you…” Ye Guhan sat down and drew a circle with his hands before putting them together. In the next second, the multiple flowers bloomed. The flowers were delicate, filling the entire atmosphere in a floral fragrance, and Lin Yun soon sank into it.

“You don’t have to comprehend my saint dao, they’re only a form of assistance to you, allowing you to comprehend dao easier,” Ye Guhan said.

“Why isn’t there a flower for Sword Dao?” Lin Yun asked. He saw many greater daos except for Sword Dao. Sword Dao might be one of the thirty-six Sovereign Daos, but it was impossible for his senior brother not to grasp it, based on his talent.

“Sword Dao has fused with my Saint Soul, and it’s hard for me to manifest it. If it manifests, it will affect your ability to comprehend dao,” Ye Guhan smiled.

“Senior Brother, have you grasped any Eternal Dao?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s a man’s secret. It’s like asking how long your dong is. Do you really want to know about it?” Ye Guhan winked, giving Lin Yun an encouraging gaze.

“You senior brother is really funny,” Lil’ Purple laughed as she hugged Lil’ Red within the Iris Secret Realm.

Lin Yun smiled awkwardly, and he waved his hand, “No need, no need.”

“Stop asking so many questions then and concentrate.” Ye Guhan waved his hand, allowing the dao flowers to fuse into the surrounding pagodas. The pagodas had dimmed down, and the Dao Comprehending Stage soon became quiet.

When Lin Yun closed his eyes, a ringing bell echoed by his ears with the thirty-six pagodas trembling. With a gentle wave, Ye Guhan left the Dao Comprehending Stage.

“It’s also time for me to cultivate.” Ye Guhan glanced at Lin Yun and began cultivating after seeing that Lin Yun had gone into the dao comprehending state.

A sword ray that was thousands of feet soared towards the sky, illuminating the entire secret realm. Lil’ Purple had already explained to Lin Yun how to comprehend dao back at the Hidden Sword Manor, so he wasn’t unfamiliar with it. Now that his senior brother was helping him manifest dao, with the thirty-six pagodas blooming again, it shouldn’t be tough for him to grasp saint dao when reaching the Heavenly Origin Phase.

But before that, he had to reach the Indigo Origin Phase. His foundation at the Azure Origin Phase was too strong, not to mention he spent a hundred years in a dream. So he would require some time to make a breakthrough.

As time passed, the sounds of ringing bells kept appearing in his mind. The insights that were initially blurred became clear, and before he knew it, a year had passed in the blink of an eye.

A powerful gale appeared on the stage that could even tear space apart. But the wind soon became gentle, as though it could tear apart mountains and rivers, bringing a warm breeze. This was the Wind Dao. It was invisible and ever-changing, and it could even crush stars after reaching a high level in it.

After a while, the wind turned into visible dao that poured into Lin Yun’s body. While the dao was swiftly consolidating, there seemed to be a seed in the surrounding atmosphere that swiftly grew into a dao flower, looking bewitching and giving off a strong fragrance.

Each petal was crystal clear and flawless. At this moment, Lin Yun had succeeded in grasping Wind Dao. But that wasn’t all as lightning began to appear on the stage, streaking across space and illuminating Lin Yun’s face. Since he had successfully comprehended Wind Dao, it was time for him to comprehend Thunder Dao.

Compared to the wind, the thunder was violent and powerful. Since ancient times, thunder had symbolized destruction and tribulation, which wasn’t something to be trifled with.

While Lin Yun was comprehending dao, a boat was drifting down a river outside the Ancient Barren Domain that Lin Yun once traveled through. Compared to the vast river, the boat was small, looking as though it would be overturned at any moment.

But the boat was stable under the surging waves. There was an incredibly beautiful young man standing on the boat, and the surging waves became as peaceful as his appearance. This person wore a silk-white gown with an exaggerated slit opened on his chest, revealing his pearl-white skin. On his right shoulder, there were leaves hanging down like willow branches, and the branches intertwined into an indigo flower.

The flower had nine petals, and the stamens were burning with flames. This young man had long and slightly curly hair, smooth cheeks, and exquisite features. This person seemed to possess the bloodline of other races since his facial features looked different from most people. His eyes were as deep as autumn water and he was standing on the boat, floating on the river. The whole scenery looked like a painting.

This person was good-looking. In addition to the lute music, he looked like he came out of a painting, looking transcendent. This person was naturally Tian Xuanzi, and there were two others on the boat, aside from him. They were his disciples, Zhuge Qingyun and Qin Cang.

“Master, aren’t we going to the Myriad Thunder Sect? Why are we taking the water route?” Qin Cang asked when the lute music ended.

“We’re going to the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea, first. We’ll be paying the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion a visit. The Blue Dragon Record has just come to an end, so it’s time to meet an old friend,” Tian Xuanzi smiled.

An old friend? Zhuge Qingyun was baffled. Within the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, the only person who could be considered an acquaintance would only be that Saint Elder.
