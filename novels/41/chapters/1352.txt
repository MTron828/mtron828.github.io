Chapter 1353 - Fight (1)

Lei Jue, who was standing beside Qin Cang, was even more arrogant than Qin Cang in his words.

Hearing that, Lin Yun’s face sank. “You think you can make me hand over the Great Saint Origin this way?”

Just when Lei Jue was about to flare up after seeing that Lin Yun wasn’t willing to submit, Qin Cang stopped him and looked at Lin Yun. “The Great Saint Origin belongs to me, to begin with. You’re only responsible for retrieving it. As for these two… well, you won’t be able to change the outcome, regardless if you’re willing to hand over the Great Saint Origin. Or do you think I should stretch my face for others to slap? Anyone who dares to make a move against me should be prepared to pay the price. I’m willing to give you a chance, but this doesn’t mean that I’m willing to give them a chance, not to mention that they can’t even enter my eyes. Lei Jue, release them!”

Lei Jue and Xuan Ying were surprised when they heard that, since they initially thought that Qin Cang captured Tang Jing and Luo Shuyi to threaten Lin Yun into handing over the Great Saint Origin. But they didn’t expect that Qin Cang would lose interest in them after killing Tang Jing and disfiguring Luo Shuyi.

“Senior Brother, you can’t let this person off. She helped Lin Yun, and Lin Yun will definitely not see her die before him.” Lei Jue argued. He wanted to let his senior brother change his mind, since he could sense that Lin Yun wasn’t that easy to deal with. They could easily get the Great Saint Origin by threatening him.

“You guys don’t understand him. How can someone who slaughtered his way out of the Heavenly Path submit so easily? As for that woman, killing her is the same as going easy on her,” smiled Qin Cang.

Just when Lei Jue hesitated, faint fluctuations spread out in mid-air, and Lil’ Red appeared with a dagger. The black dagger was flickering with a cold light that was aimed at Lei Jue’s throat. Because Lil’ Red had appeared too suddenly, even Qin Cang wasn’t able to detect Lil’ Red’s presence.

After seeing Lil’ Red charging over, Lei Jue’s face drastically changed. He could sense that his life was being threatened. Lil’ Red was simply too fast and turned into a streak of light, charging at him. Without any hesitation, Lei Jue quickly retreated.

When Lil’ Red pushed Lei Jue back, it let out a roar and transformed into its majestic ancient dracoape form. After slamming its fist against the ground, it grabbed onto Luo Shuyi before it retreated.

“You’re courting death!” Qin Cang flew into a rage. Even if Luo Shuyi had been freed, he should be the one to free her, not someone snatching her from him. Executing his movement technique, Qin Cang took a step forth and chased after Lil’ Red. When astral energy gathered into his hand and manifested into a dragon claw, he slammed the dragon claw towards Lil’ Red.

The golden dragon claw was over ten-odd feet in size, and each nail was flickering with a cold light that looked like they could easily smash a mountain apart. Furthermore, Qin Cang’s cultivation had reached a height that no normal person could ever catch up to, so his attack naturally reached a terrifying height.

“Flicking Divine Finger!” But when Qin Cang attacked, Lin Yun also flicked his finger and unleashed a sword ray. As a cold light began to gather on his finger, a loud sword vibration echoed and a boundless sword aura filled the surroundings.

In the path of the sword ray, the surrounding space began to crumble, as if the space had been pierced by the sword ray. When Qin Cang’s claw collided with Lin Yun’s sword ray, the sound of the collision resounded, as if an entire iceberg had crumbled.

But the sword ray easily pierced through the dragon claw and continued to head towards Qin Cang. Looking from afar, it looked like a comet was streaking across the horizon, containing a boundless sword aura that engulfed Qin Cang within it.

“Break!” Qin Cang had no change on his face as fine golden dragon scales began to appear on his right hand, transforming his right hand into an actual dragon claw. This time, his attack easily crushed the sword ray. When the sword ray exploded, the shockwave created by the explosion created more damage to the already cracked land.

“Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword!” As the elysium core above Lin Yun’s violet palace began to circulate, waves began to fluctuate on the golden ocean and instantly filled his body with boundless astral energy.

Pouring all the astral energy into his fingers, Lin Yun began to flick all ten of his fingers as if he was strumming a zither as an ocean of flowers appeared behind him, empowering his attack. Forming into tens of thousands of sword auras, they then shot toward Qin Cang.

Flicking all ten fingers was the highest stage one could achieve with the Flicking Divine Finger.

“Profound Sky Armor!” Qin Cang pushed his hand forth and a light began to flow over the surface of his body. He had resorted to using the Profound Sky Canon by now. The light flowing over the surface of his body soon formed into an armor that consisted of runes that enveloped him within it. At the same time, when he raised his right hand before him, it formed into a shield that was made up of runes that were created with astral energy to block the incoming sword rays that were attacking him.

When the powerful impact slammed against the shield, Qin Cang let out a groan before he was sent flying back. When he fell to the ground, the shield made up of runes shattered into pieces. Even his right sleeve was torn into pieces with wounds appearing on his arm.

“Senior Brother Qin is injured?” The faces of everyone from the Profound Sky Sect changed, feeling that this was too unbelievable.

“This is my fight with him, so no one is allowed to interfere!” Qin Cang grinned and stopped the ten-odd Greater Elysium Core Realm deacons who wanted to come and assist him.

“Lin Yun, you have finally reached the Elysium Core Realm, and I can finally sense some pressure.” Qin Cang’s eyes shone brightly. Earlier, he was probing Lin Yun, and he had suffered a slight loss because of it. This was something that he had never experienced in the past, and this made him excited with his blood boiling.

As for Ye Ziling and Su Ziyao, who wanted to step forth to help, they were stopped by Lin Yun. His face was calm and no one could ponder his thoughts as he took a step forth. “Take care of Lady Luo!”

Luo Shuyi was saved by Lil’ Red, so Lin Yun no longer had any concerns. In this fight, he would let Qin Cang know the real meaning of brutality.

“Golden Dragon Seal!” Qin Cang made the first move. He was overbearing, and he also had a strong stance. Although he had treated Lin Yun seriously, he also didn’t place Lin Yun in his eyes right from the beginning. This might seem conflicting, but this looked natural when it was from him.

As golden light exploded from his body, a claw flew out with runes enveloping the claw, instantly manifesting into a golden dragon claw that was clearly ten feet in size. This attack wasn’t extraordinary and looked like a genuine dragon claw with a saint rune engraved on his palm, and the claw was enveloped in black flames.

This was the secret technique of the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art, and it was extremely terrifying. But that wasn’t all. A painting flew out of Qin Cang’s body. This was his constellation. When the painting unfolded, golden light shone from the painting and revealed a golden divine dragon that was about a hundred feet in size that had a terrifying aura that instantly a great pressure that came crashing down.

What was even more terrifying was the sun and moon above the golden divine dragon that emitted a terrifying light. When sunlight and moonlight shone from the sun and moon, they enveloped the golden divine dragon with a layer of divine light, making every single one of its scales shine brightly, looking like golden flames that were blazing on the dragon.

At this moment, Qin Cang gave off the feeling that he was the ruler of this world, a monarch that no one could look directly at.

“This is Qin Cang’s constellation?”

“Looks like Lin Yun is doomed…” Everyone was dumbfounded as their gazes fell onto Qin Cang. At this moment, they knew that Qin Cang had finally become serious.
