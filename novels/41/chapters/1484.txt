Chapter 1485 - Abrupt Events

While everyone was resting by meditation, more envoys arrived during this period, and this caused an uproar. An hour later, Xiao Yun suddenly opened his eyes and saw everyone wearing a smile on their faces.

He headed towards Lin Yun. But before he got close, the latter had already opened his eyes. He smiled, “Brother Lin, I guess you’re interested in the astral realm, right? Let’s go, then!”

When Lin Yun heard that Xiao Yun had a child's temperament, he was naturally interested in the astral realm. He was determined to obtain the Divine Dragon Bone no matter what, regardless of the price he had to pay. But it was useless, even if they knew where the astral realm was because there would definitely be elders of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion guarding it.

Even if there weren’t any elders guarding the astral realm, he wouldn’t try to sneak in. Since An Liuyan had given him a quota, he had to consider An Liuyan’s interests. So he wouldn’t act recklessly. But before Lin Yun could hesitate, Xiao Yun already dragged him and they soared into the air.

“Hehe, you’re pretty honest despite saying you’re not interested.” Xiao Yun chuckled as he looked at Lin Yun.

This made Lin Yun speechless, but what Xiao Yun said wasn’t wrong. If he wasn’t interested, there was no way Xiao Yun would be able to drag him away.

“Are you sure you can find the location of the astral realm? The array set up by the Heavenly Astral Pavilion won’t be that easy to break…” Lin Yun asked, looking at Xiao Yun.

The array once belonged to the Heavenly Secret Sect, and the Heavenly Secret Sect’s attainment in spiritual runes was unprecedented. They had countless divine spiritualists, and they were practically invincible. Even after the Heavenly Secret Sect was eradicated, the fragments of inheritances they left behind were far beyond complicated. It would be heaven-defying if they could get the slightest bit of their legacy.

“If it’s a complete array from the Heavenly Secret Sect, there’s naturally nothing I can do to it. But the Heavenly Secret Sect isn’t as strong as you think, and it’s an incomplete array at best.” Xiao Yun snickered.

“Then again, no ordinary spiritualist could break it, even if it’s an incomplete array, but I’m no ordinary spiritualist. I have a pair of Profound Saint Yin Eyes!” Xiao Yun continued. A while later, Xiao Yun stopped and said, “This should be it.”

Lin Yun looked in the direction that Xiao Yun pointed out, but there was nothing there except for fragments of asteroids floating about and the thunderclouds commonly seen in the seventh-layer of heaven. The thunderclouds were thin, and he didn’t think they could hide an astral realm's existence.

“Haha. Look!” Seven crimson pupils appeared in the depth of Xiao Yun’s eyes. They soon began to rapidly revolve. When he activated the Profound Saint Yin Eyes, Xiao Yun reached out and tapped Lin Yun’s temple. A buzzing noise made Lin Yun feel as though his eyes had exploded.

Suddenly, he could see a gigantic nebula a few thousand miles away and hundreds of black-clothed people were guarding that nebula with an array flag. In addition, there were also seven Samsara Edict Realm experts. All seven of them were radiating an unbelievably powerful aura.

The vortex was flowing with waves of ancient aura that made Lin Yun’s heart start to throb. His Azure Dragon Saint Art had automatically activated itself, with his blood boiling. Just when Lin Yun wanted to take a closer look, Xiao Yun stopped, and Lin Yun’s surging vitality calmed down as everything disappeared once more.

“What a powerful method!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed, and he had a whole new understanding of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion.

“How is it?” Xiao Yun asked with pride flashing within his pupils.

“The two of you are really impressive. Even I don’t know the exact location of the astral realm.” A voice resounded. It was An Liuyan who came with a smile.

Lin Yun shrugged when he heard that because it had nothing to do with him.

“It’s just a little trick.” Xiao Yun smiled. But he suddenly rolled his eyes and said, “Since Lady An doesn’t know, that means the other envoys don’t know about the location, either. Why don’t we take this opportunity to enter?”

An Liuyan’s eyes briefly flashed before they died down. “This is against the rules, and the elders also won’t let us in.”

“Hehe. How will you know if you don’t give it a try? Furthermore, rules are meant to be flexible, and the elders might look at you in a different light since you can discover the location.” Xiao Yun didn’t take it seriously and continued, “If it’s not allowed, we can just enter forcibly. I don’t believe you have no background in the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. So I don’t think any of the elders will make a move against us. At most, we will only have to face Dragon Pulse Realm experts, and we can let Elder Chen block them.”

“Stop. Let’s go back. We’ll arouse suspicion if we stay here for too long.” An Liuyan said before she left.

Xiao Yun was unhappy upon seeing this and shook his head, feeling that An Liuyan was a little too cowardly. He now knew why An Liuyan was ranked at the bottom amongst the envoys. He had a feeling that this trip would be dangerous and even advised Lin Yun to make a backup plan. But suddenly, Xiao Yun stopped, and his facial expression became weird.

“What’s the matter?”

“Looks like this place isn’t only known to the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. I saw a ship flying over, and the flag should belong to the Netherworld Hall. If I remember correctly, the Netherworld Hall is also one of the seven major sects of the demonic path!” Xiao Yun said suspiciously.

Lin Yun raised his head, but he couldn’t see any ship. But thinking about Xiao Yun’s Profound Saint Yin Eyes, there was no doubt that Xiao Yun’s eyesight was way better than his in the seventh-layer of heaven. He began to wonder if the news of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion was leaked, making him fall into deep thoughts.

This was weird because the Heavenly Astral Pavilion considered this astral realm a trial ground, and they should’ve kept it at a high confidentiality.

They soon caught up with An Liuyan and told the latter about Xiao Yun’s discovery.

“How is this possible?” An Liuyan frowned.

“Lady An, you don’t trust me?” Xiao Yun smiled, but he wasn’t angry.

But just when An Liuyan was feeling suspicious, a blazing beam suddenly shot over, reaching the asteroid belts in the blink of an eye. When the dazzling light exploded in the next moment, a powerful energy fluctuation swept out into the asteroid belt.

Before the core disciples of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion could figure out what was going on, the explosion killed dozens of people, and the number of wounded was even higher. Shortly after, six more beams shot over, turning the asteroid belt into purgatory.

Countless disciples of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion wailed out in pain, and some lost their lives without even knowing what was happening. This scene made An Liuyan’s face pale as she gritted her teeth, “Saint-Grade Warship!”

Six ships suddenly appeared one after another, and each of the ships was enveloped in a dazzling light. Not only the Netherworld Hall but the Seven Absolute Palace, Blood Rain Pavilion, Demonfiend Sect, Blood Moon Sect, and the Hundred Ghost Gate were here. In addition to the Heavenly Astral Pavilion, this meant that the seven demonic sects were all here.

When the warships got close, one figure after another flew into the air from the asteroid belt. Most of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion elites had died under the sudden assault, but the thirteen envoys and their men survived.

When a few streaks of light flew over, Elder Chen, Ding Lei, Can jiu, Chen Yan, and the rest gathered around.

“What’s going on?”

“The seven demonic sects are all here…” Can Jiu exclaimed in fear.

Ding Lei and Chen Yan were also shocked as they looked at An Liuyan. But An Liuyan shook her head and explained, “I don’t know what’s going on, either.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The news of the astral realm was leaked. Since the news of an undiscovered astral realm was known to the other demonic sects, there was no way they would give up on it. In this situation, it was practically impossible for the Heavenly Astral Pavilion to monopolize the astral realm’s resources. It was also a question of whether the trial could continue.

“These people are too ruthless to attack without any warning.” Xiao Yun was a little frightened by this formation. After all, so many people inexplicably died. Just a moment ago, he was still fantasizing if he could obtain any opportunities in the astral realm, and yet so many people had been killed in just the blink of an eye.

Lin Yun was calm. Since those people had no idea of the exact coordinates of the astral realm, they could only use this method to force the Heavenly Astral Pavilion’s main party to show up. Under the cooperation of the six demonic sects, they weren’t afraid that the Heavenly Astral Pavilion would dare to launch a counterattack.

So this meant that the Heavenly Astral Pavilion could only suck it up without a choice, and this also meant that it would be a lot harder for Lin Yun to obtain a Divine Dragon Bone.
