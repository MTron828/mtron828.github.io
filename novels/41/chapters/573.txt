Chapter 574 - My Sword, Have Always Been With Me!

Lin Yun’s injuries didn’t affect his fighting spirits one bit, especially since the Flower Burial Sword was still in his hand.

Sensing Lin Yun’s aura, Cao Zhen was surprised as he said, “I admire your confidence, but you have to submit. You don’t have any other choice. The sword you used yesterday was eye opening. Let me experience it today! My next move is called Cloud Devourer!”

Cao Zhen tightened his grip on his saber and his aura began to grow violently. This made his greater Yang stage’s aura even more terrifying. When he poured all his origin energy into his sword, clouds rolled above the stage and turned the sky dark. At this moment, only Cao Zhen’s saber radiated light.

Then, a terrifying aura that seemed like it could devour everything began to emit from Cao Zhen’s saber. Cao Zhen formed a saber ray that wiggled like a viper and the clouds churned in response to this. Shortly after, a chilling aura began to sweep out from the saber that made everyone fearful.

“How terrifying…”

“It’s really devouring the clouds. This is one of the three ultimate moves of the Absolutecloud saber.”

“I heard that a core disciple of the Northern Snow Manor once used this move to kill a Yin-Yang stage wandering cultivator. I don’t think Lin Yun can block it.” The faces of the Heavenly Province Academy’s elders sank. They were all Yin-Yang stage cultivators, so they could sense the terror of this attack.

“That brat is already at his limits. I don’t think he can withstand this attack!”

“He’ll die for sure!” The faces of the White Jade Academy’s elders became sinister with deep hatred written on their faces. Their hatred for Lin Yun had taken root in their hearts when Lin Yun killed the participants from their academy. Naturally, they were eager to watch Lin Yun die. They could even imagine the scene of Lin Yun being dismembered by Cao Zhen’s attack.

When the terrifying aura reached its limit, Lin Yun felt an unprecedented pressure falling onto him. He knew that he would be struck down if he showed any flaws, but his heart and sword was calm even when facing this attack. His pupils were boiling with torrential fighting spirit as he unleashed his xiantian sword intent.

Along with a radiance coming from the Flower Burial Sword, Cao Zhen’s saber was no longer the sole source of light on the stage.

“Cloud Devourer!” Cao Zhen roared as he hacked down with his saber. His attack caused the clouds to explode as a dazzling radiance dove down and shrouded the entire stage.

Cao Zhen was hovering in the air like a deity with the saber ray reflected on his face. When he unleashed his attack, the surrounding spectators could feel their hearts beating wildly as they finally saw the Northern Snow Manor’s Absolutecloud saber that they’d heard so much about.

“Perfect!” However, Lin Yun’s reaction had surprised everyone because his eyes lit up brightly with fighting spirit. Only this attack was worthy of him using the second style of the Overlord Sword.

“Overlord Sword—Solar Slash!”

While the spectators exclaimed, Lin Yun faced Cao Zhen’s attack head-on and swung his sword. When he swung his sword, a rumbling explosion roared as powerful gales formed on both of his sides. The violent wind covered a few hundred meters and looked like the wings of a kunpeng.

Holding onto the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun soared into the sky and stabbed out. All the light shattered and the surrounding fell into absolute darkness.

“What’s going on?” Everyone was shocked by the sudden darkness. The mighty saber ray had been shattered shortly after Lin Yun stabbed his sword.

Lin Yun stood with his clothes covered in blood. His sword would never admit defeat, even if everyone else had bowed to the saber ray. As the two attacks clashed, the boundless darkness instantly dispersed. Everyone could see the violent clash as terrifying origin energy fluctuated out.

“Shit!” Many spectators’ faces changed because the shockwave was too terrifying. In the blink of an eye, the shockwave had turned the stage into ruins and was now headed for the crowd. Many spectators were caught by surprise as they were sent flying while blood filled their mouths.

Amidst the panic, the experts from the various academies made their moves to block the shockwave. But after this ordeal, many people’s faces had turned pale. The ferocious clash was beyond anyone’s expectation. They all wondered how terrifying it would be to face the attack head-on. Just thinking about it made many people tremble with fear.

In the center of the stage, Lin Yun and Cao Zhen were both suffering from the aftermath of the attacks. Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood and laid on the ground where cracks had spread out beneath him. As for Cao Zhen, he was also in a terrible state as he suffered heavy injuries. He was clutching onto his chest and threw up mouthfuls of blood every time he opened his mouth.

But right at this moment, a sword fell and plunged into the ground. It was Lin Yun’s sword, the Flower Burial Sword.

“Not good!” The faces of everyone from the Heavenly Province Academy changed as they stood up. Lin Yun had lost control of his sword. A swordsman was only powerful with his sword, so everyone could imagine the dire consequences of a swordsman without his sword.

No swordsman would let go of their sword if they could help it. Since Lin Yun wasn’t able to hold his sword tightly, he must have reached his limit. Lin Yun had lost half the battle. Although Cao Zhen was also in a terrible state, he still held onto his saber tightly.

Cao Zhen gasped for his breath with a smile on his pale face. He had won in the end, but he didn’t expect that victory would be so hard to achieve. This battle was the first step in spreading his reputation throughout the Ancient Southern Domain.

But right at this moment, Lin Yun suddenly slammed his right palm on the ground and soared into the sky to attack Cao Zhen. His clothes had been reduced to torn pieces of cloth that clung to his body. He was covered with injuries that constantly poured out blood. But his pupils were still radiating with intense fighting spirit.

“His physique is really terrifying to be able to stand despite his injuries.”

“If someone suffered such heavy injuries, they wouldn’t even be able to move. Lin Yun must practice a formidable body refining technique.

“So what? He’s just courting his death now without his sword.” The Violethut Academy was startled at first when they saw Lin Yun charging at Cao Zhen. However, they quickly calmed down. In their view, Lin Yun charging at Cao Zhen without his sword was just courting death.

“Don’t blame me since you’re courting death…” Cao Zhen’s eyes flashed coldly when he saw Lin Yun coming at him.

But a boundless killing aura suddenly descended onto the stage and everything seemed to be frozen in time. The killing aura naturally came from Lin Yun after it was multiplied sevenfold. This shocked Cao Zhen. It was already too late for him to retreat after he collected himself. In the end, he could only charge forward at Lin Yun with his saber.

Omnipresent Anger and Raging Sky!

The horrifying power of the Seven Slaughtering Seal exploded. The power of this attack had completely brought out Lin Yun’s cultivation in the pinnacle Yin stage. Additionally, his temperament had undergone a transformation. When he threw his punch, it felt like an army was charging over with their boundless killing aura.

Defiant Frustration and Resonance!

With another roar, Lin Yun threw his punches. This time, Cao Zhen could no longer defend himself as his ribs shattered and he was sent flying. The four punches from Lin Yun had shocked everyone present.

Although Lin Yun was still standing, his head was buzzing and his figure was on the verge of collapsing. He was experiencing a splitting headache right at this moment. But through his blurred vision, Lin Yun could see Cao Zhen struggling to get back up on his feet.

Exhaustion began to overwhelm Lin Yun’s consciousness. He wanted to charge forward, but his legs wouldn’t listen to him. When he wanted to go left, his body went right.

Lin Yun could barely use a forbidden fist technique like the Seven Slaughtering Fist when he was at peak condition. For him to use it under this state, he was naturally dealing damage to his enemy at the expense of suffering from the backlash.

Watching Cao Zhen slowly get back up on his feet with his cold eyes glowing, Lin Yun knew he was at his limit. He could barely remain on his feet at this moment while his body swayed left and right.

The spectators were silently watching this scene as the brutality of this battle had exceeded their expectations. They knew that Lin Yun was barely able to stand. Without a doubt, if Lin Yun fell down right now, he wouldn’t be able to get back up.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun vomited a mouthful of blood from the intense pain in his chest. He could no longer support his tattered body as he finally collapsed towards the ground. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

When Cao Zhen saw this scene, he revealed a smile on his lips.

Damn it! Am I going to lose here? Lin Yun’s consciousness was fading away as he was overwhelmed by pain and exhaustion. Although it wasn’t bad to fall down since he could no longer feel the pain and he would get to sleep. However, he would be letting himself down as a swordsman if he gave up.

But just when he was about to land on the ground, he opened his eyes and roared with all his might, “Sword!”

A sword buzz rang out and the Flower Burial Sword flew over. The Flower Burial Sword had always been with him and had never left. Even if Lin Yun had loosened his grip on it and everyone had forgotten about it, it had always been with Lin Yun. If he called its name, it would come.

Along with a brilliant sword buzz, the Flower Burial Sword turned into a streak of light and flew into Lin Yun’s hand. Just when Lin Yun was about to collapse on the ground, he raised his head to look at Cao Zhen and threw his sword at him.

The sword streaked across the stage like a meteor as it plunged into Cao Zhen’s chest. The force from the impact sent Cao Zhen flying. When he landed, he found that he was pinned to the ground by the sword.
