Chapter 2152 - Heavenly Dragon Lord

Everyone was shocked when the massive crimson moon and demonic eye appeared. The crimson moon and demonic eye gave off a powerful pressure that protected Tian Gu and Gu Xinyu.

On the clouds above the dragon mountains, the official from the Divine Dragon Empire wore a grave expression. The demonic eye and crimson moon were only phenomena, and the powerhouse behind them didn’t show up. This was a warning to them, telling them not to make a move against the juniors. Otherwise, the geniuses on the dragon mountains would be in danger if a war takes place here.

But everyone didn’t panic since the various holy lands’ parties around the dragon mountains had Saint Realm experts, and there was no lack of Great Saints. They were all discussing the words from the crimson moon. The ancestor he referred to wasn’t the sect master but the person who wounded the Blood Moon Sect.

The Blood Moon Sect had a long history and had existed since ancient times. The ancestor of the Blood Moon Sect was a mythical figure, so he might really have a relationship with the Ancestral Deity.

“Is what he said true?” Lin Yun transmitted his voice to Lil’ Purple.

“Yeah. That lord treats everyone equally, and the Dragon Gate that ruled the Kunlun Realm didn’t suppress the other sects. There were even some forces and clans that weren't weaker than the Dragon Gate. In the past, the Blue Dragon Banquet was ten times or even a hundred times grander than now. But that was too long ago, so long that even I can’t remember it,” Lil’ Purple sighed.

“He said that their ancestor was a friend with that lord,” Lin Yun said.

“Who knows? Even I claimed to be an overlord back then. Who doesn’t know how to boast and brag?” Lil’ Purple said disdainfully.

Lin Yun knew that Lil’ Purple was running her mouth again. But it felt weird for the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan to participate in the Blue Dragon Record. The Blood Moon Sect was fine since they were at least a local force within the Kunlun Realm. They just had a terrible relationship with the Divine Dragon Empire and failed back then.

But the Demonspirit Clan was a race who enslaved those from the Kunlun Realm back then. In the Dark Era, countless cultivators died, and even the end of the Golden Era was related to the Demonspirit Clan.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Lin Yun visited many ruins, and there were traces left behind by the Demonspirit Clan everywhere. He might have some conflict with the Divine Dragon Empire, but he knew what was right and wrong.

“Saint Elder, why aren’t you saying anything? Back then, the Iris Sword Saint gave the Blue Dragon Record to your Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain so that it would not become a tool for the Divine Dragon Empire. If you really do that, you might as well give the Blue Dragon Record to the Divine Dragon Empire.” The person from the Blood Moon Sect knew many secrets, so he was forcing Mu Xueling to lower her head.

“Saint Elder.” The official from the Divine Dragon Empire became nervous.

Mu Xueling raised her head and said calmly, “According to the instructions left behind by that lord, everyone can participate in the Blue Dragon Record. The Blue Dragon Record is meant for all the geniuses in the world, and it’s not a tool. Furthermore, you guys are late and the lords of the nine dragon mountains have already been decided.”

“It’s fine as long as I have those words from the Saint Elder.” The person in the crimson moon seemed to have expected that Mu Xueling would say that. The moment he finished, the crimson moon began to shrink and formed into a figure. This person was donned in a black robe, wearing a bat mask on his face that made him look mysterious.

“It’s him! He’s the Dragonbat Great Saint, one of the Blood Moon Sect’s four guardians.”

“He actually appeared? Is he courting death? His head is wanted by the Divine Dragon Empire!”

"The Blood Moon Sect is so bold now?” Everyone was shocked because the Dragonbat Great Saint was a big shot within the Blood Moon Sect. The Blood Moon Sect didn’t have a leader now, but the four guardians held the highest position. The Dragonbat Great Saint was equivalent to the fourth-highest ranking person within the Blood Moon Sect.

The moment he dies, the Blood Moon Sect would suffer a great blow and would need a long time to recover.

The representatives from the other holy lands had Great Saints among them, but it was just Mu Xueling and the official from the Divine Dragon Empire, Zi Ling, here.

The Dragonbat Great Saint smiled, “I didn’t expect so many people to remember me after so many years. It’s a pipe dream for others to destroy the inheritance of my Blood Moon Sect.”

“So you’re the one behind it!” A powerful murderous intent swept out from Zi Ling when she saw the Dragonbat Great Saint. After all, this man in front of her was an enemy of the Divine Dragon Empire.

“Young lady, you can’t do anything to me, so you better show some respect,” the Dragonbat Great Saint said.

“There are so many holy lands gathered here, and you’re only courting death by showing up!” Zi Ling snorted.

The Dragonbat Great Saint laughed, “You guys want to gang up on me? Times are different now, and the Divine Dragon Empire is no longer at its peak. If the Divine Dragon Empire can still exert power against the holy lands, would you guys need to bring out the Blue Dragon Record? It has been eight hundred years since the Empress last showed herself. I bet she failed to make a breakthrough and she’s running out of lifespan, right? Amongst the Nine Emperors, some died and some left. Which one of those left behind didn’t have an ambition? The Divine Dragon Empire is already on the decline, and the Kunlun Realm will fall into chaos soon. I'm still unsure who will rule the world in the end!”

The Dragonbat Great Saint’s words were like rumbling thunder that gave everyone a huge impact. It was true that the Empress hadn’t shown herself for many years. Even if she showed herself occasionally, it would either be a clone or an illusion, and no one had seen the Empress herself.

As a result, there were many rumors that the Empress failed to make a breakthrough and didn’t have much lifespan left. Then again, those were only rumors and no one dared to talk about it.

The Divine Dragon Empire still had control over the eight ancient domains, and the Ancient Barren Domain also belonged to the Divine Dragon Empire in name. The Divine Dragon Empire was still a behemoth that was expanding its powers.

The spiritual energy in the nine ancient domains had the highest spiritual energy than the outside world, especially the Ancient Saint Domain. But over the past hundred years, the Divine Dragon Empire faced many troubles and strong resistance. The Southern Border’s Voodoo Cult, Northern Ridge’s Ghoul Gate, Western Desert’s remnants of the Evil Buddha, and the Demonspirit Clan beneath the God Burial Mountain Range of the Eastern Desolation. The Kunlun Realm might seem prosperous, but it might fall apart the next moment.

The Dragonbat Great Saint’s words caused the various holy lands to discuss amongst themselves. They wouldn’t go as far as becoming enemies of the Divine Dragon Empire, but they also had some doubts.

So it wouldn’t have a good effect if Zi Ling wanted to gather everyone to gang up on the Dragonbat Great Saint. After all, the Dragonbat Great Saint was a powerhouse, and not many people dared to face him head-on. Not to mention there was also the mysterious demonic eye. No one knew if it might be a powerhouse from the Demonspirit Clan

The Dragonbat Great Saint gloated when he noticed this, causing Zi Ling to grit her teeth.

“After so many years, you guys can’t tell what’s right and wrong? The Demonspirit Clan should be wiped out, and the Blood Moon Sect should be wiped out now that they became the lackeys of the Demonspirit Clan. Do you guys even need an order from the Divine Dragon Empire to kill the Dragonbat Great Saint? Has everyone fallen this far?” A sigh echoed as someone spoke. This person was the palace master of the Heavenly Dao Sect’s Dao Yang Palace, Thousand Plume Great Saint.

He released his aura to envelope all the saint disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect and looked at the Dragonbat Great Saint without a hint of fear in his eyes.

When the other saints heard what he said, they were briefly stunned before they felt guilty. What the Thousand Plume Great Saint said was right because the Demonspirit Clan should be wiped out. This had nothing to do with the Divine Dragon Empire.

After hearing what the Thousand Plume Great Saint said, everyone’s morale regathered.

This infuriated the Dragonbat Great Saint as he looked at the Thousand Plume Great Saint, “Ye Qianyu, you really like to poke your nose in other matters. Let me see how many people will reach out to help when the Heavenly Dao Sect is destroyed!”

“You don’t have to care about that,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said. “The Blue Dragon Record is a grand event of the Kunlun Realm. Every holy lands’ saint disciples can leave their names on it, so you can give up trying to sow discord between us and the Divine Dragon Empire. I can pretend that you never showed up if you leave now.”

He was already starting to chase the Dragonbat Great Saint away. Everyone shared the same interest, since there was no reason for them to allow Dragonbat Great Saint to ruin the event.

The Dragonbat Great Saint sneered, “You’ll have an opportunity to become a hero in the future, but not now. It’s still up to the Saint Elder on how the Blue Dragon Record will be held.”

“I have already said that the nine dragon mountains are decided, so you guys no longer have a chance,” Mu Xueling said. She didn’t express her attitude, but she already made them clear. All the spots were taken up, so they should leave.

“Ha.” The Dragonbat Great Saint already expected that, and smiled, “Who says that all the spots are taken. Aside from the nine dragon lords, there’s another Dragon Lord!”

Mu Xueling squinted with surprise flashing through her eyes.

All the cultivators outside the dragon mountains were surprised that there was another Dragon Lord aside from the nine dragon lords. Why hadn’t they heard of it before?

Everyone on the dragon mountains were also baffled when they heard that, including Lin Yun.

“He’s not…” Lil’ Purple suddenly thought of something.

“Carry on. Don’t stop speaking halfway,” Lin Yun urged.

But just when Lil’ Purple was about to speak, Mu Xueling revealed the answer, “Aside from the nine dragon lords, it’s true that there’s another Dragon Lord, the Heavenly Dragon Lord.”

An uproar exploded from outside the dragon mountains with everyone shocked, including those on the thrones. Since when was there a Heavenly Dragon Lord? They have never heard about anyone possessing the bloodline of the Heavenly Dragon. On the contrary, there were bloodlines, dragon bones, and inheritances of the other divine dragons left behind.

As for the Heavenly Dragon, many people thought of it as a legend. This was because the Heavenly Dragon originated from a variant dragon, who evolved into a Heavenly Dragon, surpassing the seven divine dragons. But it was too much of a legend because how could a variant dragon possibly become a Heavenly Dragon?

Mu Xueling said, “But the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position requires a droplet of the Heavenly Dragon’s blood for it to appear, and I don’t have any with me.”

“It’s fine because I have it!” The Dragonbat Great Saint said.
