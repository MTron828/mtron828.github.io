Chen Ziyu revealed a prideful look with disdain, “Trash… you can’t even take three of my moves.”

When he finished speaking, he passed through the barrier and left. But Lin Yun didn’t move because he knew that the old man would attack him with the Profound Note Bell if he dared to move.

At this moment, he finally knew what shame truly meant. Looking at the old man, his eyes flashed as he barked, “Old geezer, do you dare to tell me your name?”

The old man was briefly stunned by Lin Yun’s cold gaze before he sneered, “Why wouldn’t I? You’re a dead person anyway. My name is Chen Wangye!”

When he finished, he began to form seals with his hands. The Profound Note Bell lit up with runes on its surface, which made Lin Yun’s soul feel like it was being torn apart. Each ring was like a thousand hammers that slammed against him. Even with his powerful physique, his body was bloodied.

“How pathetic,” smiled Gu Yang with a sinister smile.

“Don’t blame us. You can only blame yourself for having no background. You’re just a sword slave, yet you dare to act with such arrogance in Skymound City. Many geniuses on Dragoncloud Ranking have to act cautiously before us,” said Qin Xu coldly.

Chen Ziyu raised his chin proudly and smiled, “If you’re willing to kneel and become a dog, I can consider letting you live. After all, you’re a genius who grasped the xiantian sword intent. You’re fitting to be my slave.”

“Kneel!”

“Didn’t you hear what Young Master Chen said?”

“Kneel and beg for forgiveness!” Qin Xu and the other geniuses barked.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun roared.

Chen Ziyu’s gaze flashed coldly, “Continue making him kneel on the ground. Everyone says that a swordsman would rather die than to bow, but I’ll prove them wrong!”

“Don’t you worry. This is just the beginning!” The old man sneered as he began to form more seals, causing the ancient bell to descend inch by inch. As this happened, a ringing noise echoed inside Lin Yun’s ears.

In the end, Lin Yun couldn’t hold it together and threw up a mouthful of blood while cracking sounds came from his legs. Meanwhile, the seven geniuses watched this scene with bright eyes.

I can’t die here! I can’t die to these shameless people! I, Lin Yun, cannot die here! Lin Yun roared inwardly as he fought the torture and tried to figure out a solution.

The Profound Note Bell! An idea quickly flashed through Lin Yun’s head. The Profound Note Bell was the item that trapped him, so he had to destroy it if he wanted to escape. Since the Profound Note Bell was releasing a soundwave, there must be a rhythm to exploit.

At this critical moment, Lin Yun’s mind was clear as he found a way to deal with his situation. He decided to use himself as a sword to fight back. With a thought, Lin Yun’s muscles began to spasm to create swords. With every throb from his heart and as his bones broke, a sword buzz would ring out.

In the next second, his sword intent formed a soundwave that rippled out, causing the ancient bell to start shaking. Fine cracks began to appear on the bell, but no one noticed them. At this moment, he knew that he had succeeded. But if he wanted to break the bell, he would have to resonate with his Iris Sword Sutra and summon an Ice Phoenix to destroy the bell.

“This brat!” Chen Ziyu’s eyes turned colder seeing that Lin Yun was still resisting.

“Just kill him. We can’t let him live or there might be trouble in the future,” said Chu Muyan.

Chen Ziyu nodded his head and said, “Uncle Chen, kill him.”

“Alright!” The old man grinned as he controlled the Profound Note Bell to sink even further. But for some reason, the Profound Note Bell started to sway and cracks began to appear on the ground.

“What’s going on?” Chen Ziyu and the rest were shocked with fear on their faces.

“You think you can turn the tables around? Die!” The old man finally released his aura. The Profound Note Bell suddenly felt like a majestic mountain as it dropped onto Lin Yun. In the path of the purple fluctuation, everything turned to dust.

As the sword intent within Lin Yun’s body echoed out, Lin Yun gnashed his teeth with cold sweat dripping down from his forehead. He was trying to resist the Profound Note Bell with his sword intent while circulating the Iris Sword Sutra.

The Iris Flower in his dantian opened up and started its reverse circulation. With every circulation, the petals would manifest into silver swords.

Lin Yun gave it his all in order to resist the Profound Note Bell. This annoyed the old man as he forced the Profound Note Bell to fall even faster, “Futile resistance. Fall!”

As the Profound Note Bell continued to fall, the ancient runes continued to peel off. From afar, it looked like a flaming meteor. This made the old man’s face change as he quickly landed beside Chen Ziyu, grabbing the latter and ran off, “ good! The Profound Note Bell is about to explode…”

The Profound Note Bell turned completely red and enveloped Lin Yun. But when the Profound Note Bell landed, countless sword rays shot out and pierced through the bell. Lin Yun had riddled it with holes.

Chu Muyan and the rest also had fear all over their faces. After scrambling away, they heard saintly music echo out along with a phoenix cry. The immense shockwave emanated a terrifying aura as the Profound Note Bell began to tremble.

After Lin Yun broke free, he felt a sharp headache. He knew that the Profound Note Bell was about to blow, but he was out of time. He was completely exhausted and there was no way he could avoid the explosion. But right at this moment, a crimson figure pounced over, spreading its wings to envelop him.

“N-n-n-no!” Lin Yun’s face turned pale as he yelled out in despair.

The Profound Note Bell then exploded like a bright sun, emanating boundless energy that lit up the horizon. The ground trembled from the explosion and a huge crater of a hundred miles was left behind. Within the crater, Lin Yun’s clothes were tattered and his face was charred black as he staggered to get back up. But he couldn’t be bothered with his current state as he looked around for something.

But all he could see were the mutilated limbs. This made Lin Yun’s eyes turn black as he nearly fainted. But right at this moment, he could hear a heartbeat. When he looked in that direction, he could see a cocoon lying on the ground that brimmed with vitality.

“Lil’ Red!” Lin Yun yelled before he picked up the crimson cocoon and left.

The shockwave from the explosion sent Qin Xu and the rest flying. When they struggled to get back on their feet, they were completely dumbfounded, “This…”

The forest that was full of life was now laid to waste. If they didn’t witness this scene personally, they surely wouldn’t believe what they saw. Chen Ziyu’s face was dark as he headed towards the center of the explosion without uttering a word.

It didn’t take long for him to arrive at the crater, with Qin Xu and the rest arriving after him. When they saw the mutilated limbs on the ground, their faces changed. “It’s the corpse of that Dragon Blooded Horse…”

“But Lin Yun’s corpse is nowhere to be seen.”

“He must have exploded without leaving a trace behind. But it’s a pity that the sword slave’s interspatial pouch is also gone. After all, the Demonification Fruits and Divine Indigo Radiantstone were in there.” Everyone discussed among themselves and they were furious that they couldn’t obtain Lin Yun’s interspatial pouch.

“Young master, there’s no need to search. Even I can’t take the Profound Note Bell’s explosion head-on,” said the old man despite his ugly face. He felt heartache for the Profound Note Bell that was destroyed because of a sword slave.

Chen Ziyu also seemed helpless as he said, “Lin Yun is dead.”

Qin Xu, Gu Yang, and the other fix geniuses reacted and exchanged a glance. A brief moment later, they all spoke out, “That’s right. Brother Chen slew him with three moves. You’re truly worthy of being the leader of Skymound City’s genius.”

But Chen Ziyu didn’t say a word as he turned to look at Chu Muyan. Chu Muyan smiled before he replied, “Indeed, three moves. We all witnessed it.”

Chen Ziyu nodded his head in satisfaction, “I wouldn’t be able to do it without your help. We guarded the honour of Skymound City’s geniuses. We can finally visit Her Highness Ruoyou now.”
