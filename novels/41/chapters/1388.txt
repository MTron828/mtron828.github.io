Chapter 1389 - Lin Yun’s Temper

When Lin Yun spoke, he secretly activated his firmament sword intent to tear apart An Liuyan’s charming tricks. In the next second, a pink light screen shattered like a mirror on An Liuyan’s face, revealing a lovely face, but her face was no longer as charming as before; her actual appearance was that of a woman, yet she acted as though she was a teen.

An Liuyan was surprised for a brief moment before she smiled. But her smile soon froze on her face because Lin Yun suddenly reached out and grabbed onto her neck. This made An Liuyan suffocate and panic because she had never experienced this before.

When she sensed the killing intent released from Lin Yun, she realized that she had never felt so close to death before in her life. She knew she would lose her life if she made a careless move. But An Liuyan soon calmed herself down and made a gesture with her hand to stop the guards who were responsible for protecting her in the dark.

Lin Yun could sense several surges of killing intent locking onto him when he grabbed An Liuyan’s throat, but he remained calm and didn’t panic. After all, An Liuyan used a disgusting trick against him and crossed his bottom line.

He couldn’t be bothered if An Liuyan had a habit of using her charming tricks to probe others or if she wanted to excavate his secrets. Perhaps there was a bit of both, including trying to probe the mystery of his Great Saint Origin before trying to erase his memory. Even if she failed, she could easily smile and give an explanation that could get her out of the mess.

“Young Master Lin, calm down. I was only doing it out of interest and meant no harm.” An Liuyan stopped her guards before she squeezed out a smile, trying to ease the conflict between them. But when she saw Lin Yun maintaining his silence, she continued, “Young Master Lin, you’re under the protection of the Sword Sect, and no one will dare to do anything to you in Azureblack City. So I mean no harm.”

When Lin Yun finally let go of her throat, An Liuyan let out a breath of relief and gasped for breath because her neck nearly snapped. Though she had ensured her safety, she knew she had embarrassed herself this time.

She always felt that all men in the world were merely toys to her, and even fated transcendents weren’t an exception. She firmly believed that if she was willing, there was no man in the world she couldn’t conquer, and this was the first time she had suffered such a huge loss. This made her inwardly swear to take revenge in the future.

Despite her thoughts, she gradually wore a smile on her face. But her smile froze when Lin Yun slapped her. The resounding slap made An Liuyan’s cheek swell, and she threw out a mouthful of blood. She instantly felt dizzy.

Her cultivation was at the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, and she was much older than Lin Yun. In terms of talent, she wasn’t any weaker than Lin Yun. In addition to the fact that she was born in the Kunlun Realm, her foundation was even stronger than Lin Yun's to a certain degree.

If she had her guard up, she could easily avoid that slap. But she never expected Lin Yun to give her a slap when there were so many Dragon Pulse Realm guards protecting her in the dark, and there was even a Samsara Edict Realm expert in the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion.

She was the general manager of the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion, and Lin Yun’s act was no different from provoking the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion. So she had no idea where Lin Yun got the guts to slap her.

“You’re courting death!” A furious roar echoed as several Dragon Pulse Realm guards appeared. The one leading the guard was a middle-aged old man who was fuming at this moment.

“Stop!” An Liuyan barked as she held onto her cheek with flames blazing in his pupils. She finally had a wisp of killing intent flashing through her pupils as she began to unleash her aura, “Young Master Lin, isn’t that a little too much? Even if you’re under the protection of the Sword Sect, is there a need for you to bully a woman like me?”

“We’re all smart people, so stop faking an act. When I passed through the layers of restriction, I became isolated from the outside world, and I know what you’re planning.” Lin Yun wore a mask so no one could see his expression, but his voice was cold, making his entire temperament cold.

An Liuyan’s face changed, and she coldly said, “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

“You don’t know? Then let me tell you.” Lin Yun wasn’t polite with her and continued, “You pointed out my identity because you wanted to shake my mind so that you could charm me. When you failed, you added an illusion to your charming tricks, and that’s the second time. But even when I released you, you still didn’t give up, and that’s the third time!”

Lin Yun knew what she was planning. She probably wanted to know the secret of the Great Saint Origin. After all, there were many rumors that the Profound Wither Great Saint’s Great Saint Origin was related to the Southern Emperor’s treasures.

Even if her schemes were exposed, she was a woman and could pretend to be weak to brush it off. But it was too much for her to treat him like a fool, which was why Lin Yun wasn’t polite to her and gave her a slap as a warning and punishment.

There was something weird about her charming tricks because Lin Yun nearly fell for it even when he possessed the firmament sword intent. Simultaneously, he knew this woman wouldn’t know when to stop if he didn’t give her a lesson.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, An Liuyan’s face briefly changed before the charm in her eyes finally dissipated, and she waved her hand, “Leave us!”

When the Dragon Pulse Realm guards backed down, the Samsara Edict Realm expert released a faint aura on Lin Yun in the dark. This was a warning, but Lin Yun had merely ignored it. He was here to conduct a transaction, so he had no need to flip the table since it would be troublesome for him to look for another chamber of commerce.

“It’s no wonder why you can step on Qin Cang. I admit that I lost,” said An Liuyan. The charm she revealed completely disappeared, and Lin Yun could tell from this that An Liuyan wasn’t simple.

“Aren’t you here to sell saint artifacts? Follow me!” An Liuyan said before she turned around and left.

Before Lin Yun left, he turned to look at the cauldron under the lake with reluctance. He was simply too poor, so one could imagine how he would react after seeing a cauldron filled with True Dragon Saint Liquid. The entire cauldron was filled with True Dragon Saint Liquid, and there were at least 500 kilograms. Even if he couldn’t take it, it would still be satisfying for him to look at it.

After following An Liuyan, they arrived in a room filled with an aroma. This place seemed to be An Liuyan’s room, decorated entirely with furniture. This room was complicated, and there was even a chamber meant for seclusion.

But there wasn’t a guest hall, so An Liuyan brought Lin Yun to a quiet room. “Wait here. I’ll be back shortly.”

After An Liuyan left, Lin Yun began to examine the entire room. Every piece of furniture here was filled with spiritual energy, and there was even an extraordinary incense. Opening the incense pot, Lin Yun noticed that the incense used wasn’t simple, and it was probably made from rare flowers mixed with other precious ingredients. From that, Lin Yun concluded that An Liuyan was filthy rich and wasn’t stingy to herself.

“Lin Yun, you hit a woman!” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the sword box. But her tone soon changed, and she chuckled, “Hehe. But this empress liked it.”

“Your views are weird,” replied Lin Yun.

“Who do you think this empress is? I’ve seen all kinds of bitches in ancient times, and you have no idea how many of them this empress has killed with my divine breath. A bitch like her needs a beating, or she won’t learn from her lesson, and that’s how you should treat a woman like her. If you treat her well, you’ll only be looked down upon by her. This empress is proficient in dealing with women like her, and they can only obediently be my maid back in ancient times…” Lil’ Purple said with a disdainful tone.

Lin Yun knew that Lil’ Purple’s ‘illness’ had relapsed. But An Liuyan wasn’t as simple as Lil’ Purple said because her charming skill was terrifying. Not only could she combine it with her illusion, but her charm could also invade the hearts of others, which even made Lin Yun see her as Su Ziyao.

He speculated that she probably cultivated a cultivation technique of the demonic path. Judging from her young age, this only meant that she had a terrifying background. It wasn’t shocking that the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion’s background was a demonic force.

There were too many powerful sects in the Ancient Barren Domain, so the demonic forces couldn’t openly interfere. But they also didn’t want to let go of the profits, so they could only disguise themselves.

The moment Lil’ Purple started boasting, she would endlessly go on. But since Lin Yun had nothing to do, he would spend some time replying to her. Even a long time later, An Liuyan was still nowhere to be seen. Lil’ Purple was bored and asked, “Why isn’t she here after so long? Is she scheming something?”

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised and replied, “Her face was swollen with her dress dirtied with her blood, not to mention her makeup was all messed up. So she naturally has to clean herself up. Without four hours, you won’t be able to see her.”

“You’re really a playboy to even know this,” replied Lil’ Purple.

Six hours later, An Liuyan finally reappeared. Her face was no longer swollen, and she had patched up her makeup. She changed into a red dress that exposed her voluptuous figure.

“Sorry to keep you waiting,” smiled An Liuyan charmingly.

Lin Yun knew that An Liuyan still didn’t give up, but he didn’t care about her since she didn’t use her charming tricks. He took out all the saint artifacts from his interspartial pouch, and said, “No worries. Let’s go ahead with the business, then.”

In the beginning, An Liuyan wasn’t too bothered by it. She looked at most of the saint artifacts that belonged to the Thunder Sect, Flame Phoenix Sect, Myriad Beast Gate, and Flame Dragon Sect; those forces that were only second to the powerful sects. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Those big sects naturally had terrifying foundations, especially the stone table that contained a drop of blood from a Jiao-Dragon. It was an intermediate-grade hundred-rune saint artifact. She knew the rumors weren’t fake; Lin Yun had started a massacre on the Profound Wither Island, and these war trophies were proof of that.

These were all treasures. They weren’t things ordinary people would dare to use because those big sects would hunt them. When Lin Yun took out eight saint artifacts, in the end, An Liuyan finally couldn’t bear it any longer and immediately grabbed one of them, “Feng Xuanzi’s creation!”

When she examined the remaining seven saint swords, she knew that they were all forged by Feng Xuanzi, leaving her utterly shocked.
