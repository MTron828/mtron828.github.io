Chapter 1108 - Using Flute As A Sword

By now, many people in the Flying Cloud Palace felt that Lin Yun would be heading out. However, another azure beam flew into the sky to manifest an Azure Bird. This meant that Lin Yun passed the 11th test!

“How is this possible?!” Ye Ziling exclaimed with shock on her face because there was no path after the tenth test. Since there was no path, it was impossible to make it to the 11th test. But there were 11 azure birds circling the mountain with divine auras.

“Wow, how did Senior Brother Yun manage to do that? Senior Sister, what’s going on?” Wang Yuruo was also deeply shocked by this scene.

Locking her brows together, Ye Ziling replied, “I have no idea. Is his talent really that terrifying?”

“Senior Sister, haven’t you ever wanted to see the last three swords in the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords? If Lin Yun is able to get it, you can ask for it from him!” Wang Yuruo suddenly smiled.

Her words made Ye Ziling’s eyes lit up, but her pupils soon dimmed upon recalling Lin Yun’s gaze. She didn’t believe that Lin Yun would give it to her if he could really ascend the peak. Furthermore, she was a lot stronger than Lin Yun in terms of cultivation, so she couldn’t lower herself to challenge Lin Yun.

“He still hasn’t ascended the peak. Right now, he only grasped one sword more than me,” said Ye Ziling stubbornly, not wanting to admit her loss.

“The 11th test. Lin Yun seems to have broken the record in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. The highest record in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was only the tenth test, and that was seven centuries ago,” whispered someone in the crowd.

Today, Lin Yun broke a record from seven centuries ago. It made the disciples, elders, and even the sect master feel a little depressed.

“How did this brat manage to do it?” The sect master was shocked because he had also ascended the Sword Saint Mountain before, but he got stuck in the tenth stage.

Four hours later, another sword hum echoed out with an Azure Bird. This meant that Lin Yun had passed the 12th test. Lin Yun was only one test away from ascending the mountain.

“Oh my god, is Lin Yun really going to ascend the peak?”

“Is Lin Yun really going to break the record?!”

“First, he mastered a sword technique in seven steps. Now, he’s going to ascend the mountain!”

“How can we compete with him? He’s only in the Heavenly Soul Realm!” Now that Lin Yun was only one test away from ascending the peak, the entire Flying Cloud Palace broke into an uproar. Only Ye Ziling’s face was wearing an ugly expression. After all, she made a bet with Lin Yun where she would agree to his demands if he reached the top.

After Lin Yun completed the 12th test, he headed towards the last mountain. Both he and Lil’ Purple had excitement on their faces because they only had the last mountain left.

Suddenly, music from a flute sounded out as Lin Yun saw a person at the top of the mountain enveloped in sword light.

“Using a flute as a sword!” Lil’ Purple was surprised before she continued, “Lin Yun, be careful. This test won’t be easy for you.”

When she was done speaking, she disappeared into the sword box. Wearing a grave expression, Lin Yun knew that this test wouldn’t be simple because Lil’ Purple didn’t hide inside the sword box in the previous two tests.

Soon, Lin Yun arrived before the azure figure who looked similar to the person from the paintings of the previous test. He couldn’t help speaking out, “Wind howling in the desolate sea.”

“Stars accompanied by the jade flute.” The azure-clothed person smiled.

“Senior, you’re the owner of this place?” Lin Yun asked.

The azure-clothed person shook his head and smiled, “I’m not. I’m merely the spirit guarding the mountain. This mountain belongs to my master.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun began to wonder what the origin of the mountain was.

“As long as you can get through this test, you’ll be able to ascend the mountain. Then, you’ll have the last sword of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords and the last verse of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra,” said the azure-clothed person.

“So how do I pass the final test?” Lin Yun asked.

“Last half an incense’s time under the influence of my music,” replied the azure-clothed person.

“That doesn’t sound too difficult,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Talk after you’ve experienced it. Let’s get started.” The azure-clothed person didn’t waste time with Lin Yun and placed the flute by his lips. Before Lin Yun could react, the music already charged towards him and made his face change.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun drew his sword and unleashed sword rays against the incoming music. Suddenly, the flute music changed and became filled with desolation. This made cracks spread out on Lin Yun’s internal organs as he felt his blood freeze. Soon after, sword wounds began to appear on his body as he was covered in blood.

But just when he was about to find a resolution, a piece of music resonated and made Lin Yun feel as though he was being preyed on by a colossal dragon. Blood began to drip from his lips as his face turned pale. Taking a few steps back, Lin Yun managed to regain his footing. In the end, Lin Yun failed.

“Do you want to continue?” The azure-clothed person placed the flute down and smiled.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly because he had never experienced this before and had no idea how to deal with it. He had lost before he could even bring out his full strength, and this was only because the azure-clothed person had gone easy on him.

“Yes!” Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips and continued, “But give me some time.”

“I won’t wait for long or else the beautiful scenery here will disappear,” smiled the azure-clothed person.

“Two hours! Just two hours!” Lin Yun replied.

“Alright.” The azure-clothed person pondered before he smiled, “It’s not easy to wait for a person, but I'll wait for two hours.”

“Thank you.” Lin Yun turned around and called out Lil’ Purple when he got to the foot of the mountain.

“I have two hours. Do you have a solution to let me last half an incense’s time?” Lin Yun asked because Lil’ Purple said that she had a solution and she needed two hours.

“What kind of look is that? Are you looking down on this empress? Take out the jade flute given to you by your little lover.” Lil’ Purple said confidently. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“You’re not asking me to use the flute as a sword, right? But I don’t even know how to use a flute.” Lin Yun was surprised by Lil’ Purple’s words.

“Of course!” Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes before she snorted, “Otherwise, what else can you do? There’s no way you can last half an incense’s time with your current strength. His sword intent isn’t flawed, but yours is flawed. You’re lucky that you only need to last for an hour or else you won’t even be able to last for a split second if he gets serious.”

“Are you sure about that?” Lin Yun asked.

“It will be a different story with the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute that your lover gave you. With my guidance, it’ll be possible for you to last for half an incense’s time,” smiled Lil’ Purple.

Lin Yun suddenly realized what was going on. After all, the flute given to him by Yue Weiwei had an extraordinary origin.

“I’ll teach you a way to circulate your origin energy.” Lil’ purple took the flute. As they were in a rush for time, she gave a really fast tutorial. When she was done, she handed the flute over and smiled, “Come, give it a try.”

Lin Yun placed the flute by his lips and gently tapped on the flute. Not long later, ethereal music flowed out. Placing the flute down, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts before he blew it once more, “Let me try again.”

Lil’ Purple had disdain on her face in the beginning, but her face gradually changed because it actually wasn’t bad.

When Lin Yun was done, he placed the flute down and smiled, “That was simple.”

Meanwhile, Lil’ Purple was shocked because Lin Yun had learned the basic technique so quickly. But it was naturally impossible for her to praise Lin Yun, so she praised herself instead, “That’s because I’m a good teacher!”

Lin Yun smiled and chose not to argue with her. Right at this moment, some flute music sounded out from the mountain that made Lin Yun’s blood boil. Hearing the music, Lin Yun praised the skill inwardly. He knew that the other party was flaunting their skill on purpose.

When Lil’ Purple heard that, her face became ugly. Right at this moment, the azure-clothed person’s voice sounded out from the mountain, “Lad, I can teach you if you want to learn. But you only have two hours, and it’s too unrealistic for you to get through this test relying on flute music.”

“That fellow actually dared to look down on this empress!” Lil’ Purple became enraged and pulled Lin Yun down the mountain, “Let’s go somewhere further and don’t let him listen. Let’s teach him a lesson. This Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute is comparable to a divine artifact. So there’s no need to fear him.”

Looking at Lil’ Purple’s reaction, Lin Yun smiled bitterly and followed her. However, he was unconvinced that he would last half an incense’s time.
