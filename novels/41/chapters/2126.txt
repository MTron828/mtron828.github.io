Chapter 2127: I See...

Before the punch that looked like a Buddha’s fist came close to Lin Yun, it had already unleashed a terrifying holy aura, causing the entire palace to tremble. This punch could easily kill a Quasi-Saint in the Indigo Origin Phase.

As Lin Yun’s hair and clothes fluttered, his gaze became sharp, and he drew out the Flower Burial Sword. When the sword and punch came in contact, a series of a few hundred explosions of saint aura resonated with the stone pillars in the main hall as various phenomena appeared from the stone pillars.

As the Buddhist radiance shattered like a bubble, Cao Yang spread his arms apart and took several steps back before stabilizing himself. On the other hand, Lin Yun revolved in the air before stabilizing himself.

“Astral Sword Intent!” Cao Yang’s eyes were shocked when he looked at Lin Yun. He muttered, “You can confront greater dao with your sword intent. I didn’t believe it initially, but I believe it now.”

“You’re not bad yourself. You didn’t use your full strength, but it was also a casual attack from me,” Lin Yun said.

Cao Yang cursed inwardly because Ye Qingtian began to pretend after praising him. He wasn’t convinced, but he could sense that Ye Qingtian wasn’t a pushover from their previous clash. Even if he hadn’t used his full strength earlier, he knew dealing with Ye Qingtian quickly was practically impossible.

Cao Yang’s face changed, and he said, “Ye Qingtian, how about this? The True Dragon Saint Pellet goes to me, and I’ll let you choose first if we come along with other treasures later.”

This was equivalent to acknowledging Lin Yun’s strength, allowing the latter to cooperate with him for the time being.

Lin Yun asked in surprise, “You only want the saint pellet?”

“That’s right. I only want the saint pellet.” Cao Yang’s expression eased, smiling, “Everything can be negotiated as long as you let me have the saint pellet.”

Cao Yang initially thought that Ye Qingtian would compete with him for the saint pellet, so he showed hostility. But if Ye Qingtian was willing to step back, everything could be negotiated.

“Are you sure about that?” Lin Yun asked.

“I am absolutely sure,” Cao Yang smiled. “If you’re willing to let me have the saint pellet, I can compensate you with a saint herb.”

As Cao Yang spoke, he took out a saint herb. This was the Thunderfrost Saint Fruit, a rare fruit with lightning and ice attributes. If taken outside, it would have a high value and could be exchanged for at least ten thousand saint crystal stones.

Saint crystal stones were spiritual stones used by Saint Realm experts and the most valuable currency in the Kunlun Realm. Cao Yang was feeling a heartache, but he still wore an amicable smile as though this fruit was nothing to him.

“Alright.” Lin Yun went along with it and received the Thunderfrost Saint Fruit.

“Hehe.” Cao Yang couldn’t help smiling. He felt a little embarrassed for giving Ye Qingtian the Thunderfrost Saint Fruit because the value of the True Dragon Saint Pellet was unimaginable. He kept the True Dragon Saint Pellet in his interspatial pouch and smiled, “We’re good now since you agreed to it.”

Suddenly, dazzling starlight shone from the nine pillars and formed into saint runes. When the saint runes flew to Lin Yun’s palm, it released an ethereal music.

“What’s that?!” Cao Yang was shocked because the radiance was too bright, and he couldn’t see clearly. Ultimately, the saint runes formed a dazzling star, releasing powerful starlight as it was engraved on the Black Thunder Chains.

The Black Thunder Chains was transformed into a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, leaving Cao Yang dumbfounded. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing.

But that wasn’t the end as Lin Yun rose to the sky and spread his hand out into the starry sky on the dome, and the starlight in the main hall began to decrease. When the starlight had completely become dim, Cao Yang’s face changed.

After a while, moonlight bloomed from Lin Yun’s palm as a bright moon appeared in the sky, along with a saint radiance that made Lin Yun look sacred. This was the glorymoon spirit, which Lin Yun engraved on his Black Thunder Chains, releasing a dazzling radiance that forced Cao Yang to close his eyes.

As the radiance of three glory spirits shone brightly, Cao Yang squinted with shock. When he came to his senses, regret surfaced, and he yelled bitterly, “I understand now!”

He now understood why Lin Yun would show such a weird expression when he said he wanted the True Dragon Saint Pellet and even verified with him multiple times. After all, Lin Yun had just created a Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact!

This was unbelievable because it didn’t require a Heavenly Spiritualist to refine the Black Thunder Chains and easily raised it to a Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact. This was simply ridiculous. After all, Cao Yang was shocked enough that it was a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, and he knew the value of a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact.

As a Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact, it was simply unimaginable to him. He knew how high the value of a Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact was, which was unimaginable to him. As Cao Yang lowered his head to look at the True Dragon Saint Pellet, the corner of his lip twitched, and his face became ugly. The True Dragon Saint Pellet immediately became less precious in his hands, especially after thinking he had given out a Thunderfrost Saint Fruit. Cao Yang wanted to dig a hole and stuff his head in it, as it was too embarrassing.

Lin Yun stabilized himself and examined his right hand with a satisfied expression.

“A Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact?” Cao Yang came over and said sourly, “Ye Qingtian, congratulations.”

“Thank you,” Lin Yun nodded with a smile.

“My Thunderfrost Saint Fruit…” Cao Yang rubbed his nose because he wanted it back.

“Thank you as well,” Lin Yun smiled.

Seeing Lin Yun wasn’t following his words, Cao Yang smiled awkwardly, “It’s fine as long as it can help you.”

Cao Yang wore a bitter expression, but he could do nothing about it.

Lin Yun glanced at Cao Yang and noticed what the latter was thinking. But he had no intentions of returning the Thunderfrost Saint Fruit. Long before he fought Cao Yang, he noticed the secrets of the stone pillars and the dome. But he didn’t expect Cao Yang’s attention to focus only on the True Dragon Saint Pellet, which greatly benefited Lin Yun.

Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of Cao Yang, to begin with. Now that he had a Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact, he naturally wouldn’t place Cao Yang in his eyes. As footsteps sounded, the footsteps sounded weird, and each footstep was like a bell ringing, containing a certain powerful dao that formed a soundwave.

Cao Yang’s face changed because he knew a formidable foe had arrived. But compared to Cao Yang, Lin Yun was more composed because he also had the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, a quasi-domain form. This meant the newcomer had a powerful martial intent comparable to the sixth-grade sword intent.

“It’s Young Master Dawnnote, Mo Li!” Cao Yang exclaimed. Young Master Dawnnote Mo Li was a genius of the Western Desert’s Falling Note Mountain, ranked sixty-ninth on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking.

Cao Yang recognized this person because they both came from the Western Desert. He fought Mo Li multiple times, and he lost all the fights.

“You know him?” Lin Yun asked.

Cao Yang nodded, “He’s ranked sixty-ninth on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking, and I’m at seventy-eighth. I fought him five times but didn’t even win once.”

“Those fellows say that the True Dragon Secret Realm is too low-leveled, but they’re all here,” Cao Yang muttered. The True Dragon Secret Realm was insignificant to the eyes of many, and Cao Yang initially planned on showing his might here. But he didn’t expect there to be so many ruthless people here.

“The Falling Note Mountain is like the Ancient Vajra Monastery, an ancient holy land. Their disciples practice the Heavenly Note Demonic Canon, which is neither righteous nor demonic. They specialize in demonic music and pay attention to cultivating their physique, walking the path of becoming a saint through the physique. The Heavenly Note Demonic Canon’s Azure Nether Saint Physique isn’t any weaker than our Ancient Vajra Monastery's Vajra Golden Physique,” Cao Yang explained.

As the bell rang stopped, a youthful figure appeared in the main hall, and this person was Young Master Dawnnote, Mo Li. When he gazed at the empty hall, there weren’t any treasures around.

“There should be a True Dragon Sint Pellet here, and I can smell it from afar.” Mo Li examined Lin Yun and Cao Yang before his gaze fell on the latter, “You took it?”

Cao Yang nodded, “There are still treasures along the way. You want to join us?”

“Him as well?” Mo Li turned to look at Lin Yun.

Cao Yang smiled, “You’re looking down on him? In terms of fame, even the two of us might not be comparable to him.”

“Oh?” Mo Li took a few more glances at Lin Yun before his face changed, and he said, “I remembered it now. You’re Ye Qingtian!”

“That’s me,” Lin Yun replied.

“As the Holy Maiden Killer, you have a higher fame than the two of us,” Mo Li smiled.

Lin Yun looked at Mo Li and held down his anger, but his nickname appeared well known now.”

“What’s with the stone pillars? There should be paintings on it.” Mo Li examined the stone pillars.

“I don’t know. It was already like this when I came,” Cao Yang said. He knew what kind of person Mo Li was; he wasn’t a pushover. Although Mo Li claimed to be here for the True Dragon Saint Pellet, he did not want it after seeing it and was concerned about Lin Yun’s existence. But when Lin Yun was dealt with, Mo Li wouldn’t hesitate to attack him.

Mo Li wore a weird expression and didn’t dwell on it any longer as the three explored this underground palace. They ran into some troubles along the way, but he easily dealt with them. After seeing Lin Yun make a move, Mo Li was surprised and didn’t dare look down on Ye Qingtian further. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“A prodigy in the sword. You deserve your reputation,” Mo Li praised.

Lin Yun casually responded, but he didn’t lower his guard. The three seem to be traveling together, but they have their thoughts, and a fight might occur anytime. This was why he deliberately showed off his strength, as Mo Li seemed to have placed his target on him.

In the end, they came to an ancient bronze gate. This should be the deepest region of the underground palace, and they would have harvests if they passed through it.

“Open!” Cao Yang made a move by throwing a punch at the bronze gate.

His punch on the bronze gate produced a loud boom, and Cao Yang was sent flying away. But Cao Yang didn’t give up as he brought out the Vajra Golden Physique, enveloping himself in golden radiance. His head became golden, and he threw three punches at the ancient bronze gate. But this time, Cao Yang groaned and was sent flying away again by the backlash.

“Hmph.” Mo Li sneered, and a zither string appeared with his hand. A terrifying shockwave charged at the bronze gate as he strummed it, but it stood unmoving. Even so, Mo Li didn’t give up as more emerald strings appeared in the air, and he began strumming it.

Various soundwaves charged at the bronze gate, but the bronze gate still didn’t budge. This made Me Li's Face change as he turned to look at Lin Yun.

Cao Yang also turned to look at Lin Yun because they already made their moves, and it was Lin Yun’s turn now. But Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry as he examined the bronze gate before pulling it through the air. When a huge force fell onto the bronze gate, the bronze gate creaked as it opened in their direction.

“This door opens outward,” Lin Yun said.

This placed Mo Li and Cao Yang in an awkward position because they wanted to show off their strength and let Lin Yun know the weight of the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking.

“I see…so it opens outward.” Cao Yang nodded, pretending to be enlightened by Lin Yun’s words.

“Let’s go in,” Mo Li said furiously. With that, the three stepped into the ancient bronze gate.
