Chapter 1631 - Nine-Star Demon Venerable (2)

The chief disciples of the Netherworld Palace, Seven Absolute Palace, Blood Rain Pavilion, Demonfiend Sect, and Hundred Ghost Gate furrowed their brows because this person looked a little familiar.

“An Liuyan, what are you doing?” The chief disciple of the Netherworld Palace, Chen Yu, spoke out. This immediately left the other chief disciples shocked. Now that they looked at the person again, this woman looked similar to An Liuyan, despite wearing a mask that covered half of her face. Now that Chen Yu mentioned it, this person did seem similar to An Liuyan.

“What are you guys doing, then?” An Liuyan smiled.

“We’re waiting for the Venerable of the Demon Gate. I don’t believe you’ve not received any information about it.” Chen Yu said coldly. They sneaked into the Ancient Barren Battlefield to look for opportunities and received news that a Venerable of the Demon Gate would gather them in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. They initially didn’t believe it, but no one could fake it. This was why no one dared to act recklessly.

“I see… Then, why aren’t you guys going down on your knees upon seeing me?” An Liuyan removed her mask and smiled, revealing her flawless features. Before her beauty, even the moon became dimmer.

While everyone was surprised, An Liuyan took out a silver medal with a bloody ‘Demon’ engraved on it. There were nine stars on top of that word, and the entire medal gave off a bizarre aura. Upon seeing the medal, the faces of the other demonic sects’ disciples changed. But they were only briefly stunned before they went down on their knees and cupped their hands together.

““We greet The Venerable!”” A uniformed voice echoed in the valley.

Chen Yu cupped his hands together while being surprised upon seeing the medal. The other demonic sects’ chief disciples also exchanged gazes filled with disbelief. How could An Liuyan possibly be a Nine-Star Demon Venerable?

Three thousand years ago, when the Heartless Demon Emperor fought in the Darkest Era, all the demonic forces in the world, aside from the Blood Moon Sect, were managed by the Demon Gate. A Venerable of the Demon Gate possessed the authority of life and death over the disciples of the other demonic sects.

The greatest dream of every demonic sects’ disciples was joining the Demon Gate and becoming a disciple. But the threshold was high, and their talent was divided into one to nine stars after entering.

It was hard to make it through the test. After making it through, it was rare for one to be graded nine stars because the Demon Gate would seriously nurture that person with the qualifications to compete for the holy maiden position. But how was that possible?

The chief disciple of the Netherworld Palace was stumped. He had only heard that the Demon Gate might send out a Venerable, but he didn’t believe that. The Ancient Barren Domain was obtained by the Sword Emperor long ago and belonged to the Divine Dragon Empire by name. With these two giants, no other Emperors would dare to dip their hands in the Ancient Barren Domain.

As long as the Emperors didn’t appear, no one would dare to compete with the Radiant Sword Saint, not the holy land or the Demon Gate. The Radiant Sword Saint forged his name by taking the lives of multiple saints.

In the past, when demonic sects’ geniuses entered the Ancient Barren Domain, they would maintain a low profile. So it was against the rules for a Demon Gate’s disciple to appear. Did they think the Radiant Sword Saint would die and no longer interfere in the Ancient Barren Domain? Since the Demon Gate had someone come here, did that mean that the other holy lands also had people? But why was it An Liuyan?

“I’m here to search for a Dragon Clan’s body-refining technique in the Blue Dragon Saint Palace, the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art. So do your best upon entering the Blue Dragon Saint Palace, and death to anyone to disobeys!” An Liuyan’s voice sounded cold as she emitted a terrifying divine dragon’s aura that made everyone feel a chill run down their spines.

“We’ve received your order!”

Ye Qingxuan and Gu Ruochen returned to the Saint Constellation Snow Valley two days later.

“Senior Brother, did you manage to obtain any harvests?” Mu Qingqing asked.

Nodding his head, Gu Ruochen replied, “We suffered a little, but we managed to obtain something. We found the location of the Blue Dragon Saint Palace, and it won’t be long before it appears.”

“Is the Blue Dragon Saint Palace going to appear?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with light because this wasn’t the first time he had heard of it.

Gu Ruochen looked at Lin Yun with a smile, “I heard a lot of people mentioning your name along the way. You’ve really displayed the might of our Sword Sect. And yes, the Blue Dragon Saint Palace does exist.”

“What kind of existence is the saint palace?” Lin Yun asked curiously. Not only Lin Yun but everyone else turned to look at Gu Ruochen.

“The saint palace is the inheritance palace of the Dragon Gate, and the palace itself is a divine artifact. It is rumored that the Mo Clan forged it. Even in the battle back then, the seven palaces were undamaged, and they would appear every century. The previous one that appeared was the White Dragon Saint Palace, so it’s the Blue Dragon Saint Palace this time. The seven palaces of the Dragon Gate are similar to the Sword Sect’s seven peaks, and each one has its inheritance. Then again, there’s no way the Sword Sect’s inheritance can compete with the Dragon Gate. There are rumors that there are the Divine Palaces above the Saint Palaces and the Ancestral Palace above the Divine Palace.”

Lin Yun recalled obtaining the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella from the White Dragon Divine Palace. Meanwhile, everyone was shocked when they heard that. It was as though they were listening to a legend.

“It is said that the Nine Emperors have received the Ancestral Palaces’ inheritance, which is why they can suppress the Darkest Era.” Mu Xueqin continued.

“We’re going to the saint palace?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s for sure.” Gu Ruochen replied. He glanced at Ye Ziling before he continued, “At that time, we will probably have to face the Profound Sky Sect.”

“This fight is unavoidable. It’s only a matter of time.” Lin Yun said.

“That’s right. Even if we don’t go to the Azure Dragon Saint Palace, the Profound Sky Sect will still come after us once we’re outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield.” Gu Ruochen said.

“The Profound Sky Sect suffered a terrible loss this time, and even Yan Kong was killed. Only Qin Tian and Liu Xu remain. Now that our two senior brothers are back, we no longer have to fear them anymore!” Gongsun Yan said with fighting spirits blazing in his pupils.

His words represented the thoughts of many of the Sword Sect’s disciples, especially after they witnessed Lin Yun’s strength.

But Gu Ruochen shook his head, “There’s no way Yan Kong can be compared to Qin Tian. If I had faced Yan Kong, I would have 50% odds of winning. But when facing Qin Tian, I don’t even have 20% odds of winning, and I don’t have an exact idea as to how strong Qin Tian is.”

Lin Yun didn’t say a word when he heard that. His current strength on the surface might not be comparable to Qin Tian, but it was uncertain if he went all out.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Gu Ruochen continued, “While we were searching for the saint palace, we found many silhouettes that belong to the holy lands.”

“Holy lands? They really dare to come in?” Gongsun Yan asked, shocked.

“It’s different now. There are rumors that Martial Ancestor Radiant’s lifespan is less than five years. This is why the holy lands are starting to make a move. This can be considered their probing.” Gu Ruochen sighed.

“This isn’t exactly a bad thing. Qin Tian will have some reservations if the holy lands have joined in.” Ye Qingxuan smiled.
