Chapter 1830 - Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact

“Heh. Your arm is crippled? Come, let me take a look at it!” Gu Jun was no longer depressed as his eyes lit up and walked over. When he examined Mei Zihua’s arm, the arm was weakly dangling down, and even the muscles had withered. He then grabbed Mei Zihua’s arm and swung it around with a serious expression. “This arm? It really seems to be crippled now.”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“How is it?” Mei Zihua asked nervously. He had already noticed something strange when he activated the Black Thunder Chains earlier. The chains were incredibly heavy, and it was painful for his arm when the Profound Lightning Sacred Flame blazed.

He was nearly dragged over by the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. If Lin Yun hadn’t helped him out, the outcome might’ve been completely different. When he slightly recovered his strength, he was shocked to see that he couldn’t muster any strength in his arm.

“Does it hurt?” Gu Jun swung his arm around, but his arm was like a sleeve flinging around.

“It doesn’t hurt.” A glimmer of hope ignited in Mei Zihua’s heart, and he asked, “Can it still be saved?”

“It’s fine.” Gu Jun smiled.

“Can it be saved?” Mei Zihua rejoiced.

But with a gloating smile, Gu Jun replied, “You won’t be able to play the flute in the future, but you can still barely play the zither with one hand. How pitiful, the descendant of one of the musical clans is crippled just like that. Don’t call yourself Saint Hands in the future, you can consider calling yourself One-Armed Demon Zither.”

Mei Zihua immediately panicked when he heard that, and he asked, “Senior, can it really not be saved?”

Nodding his head, Gu Jun replied, “It’s crippled. Speaking of which, you’re a musician and don’t know anything about the Black Tortoise inheritance. So why did you go touch the Black Thunder Chains? Where did you get your confidence from with your physique? It’s too late now, and I suggest you amputate it.”

“What?!” Mei Zihua fell into despair when he heard that.

Right then, a hand fell onto his right arm, and it was from Lin Yun. When Lin Yun removed his hand, he said, “It’s not as serious as he said.”

“Really?” Mei Zihua asked, but he didn’t believe it.

Taking a sip of wine, Gu Jun smiled, “You have a way? I don’t believe it. Not only are his meridians destroyed, but his muscles and bones are also damaged by the Black Thunder Sacred Flame. Aside from the Witherwood Saint Pellet, I can’t think of any other way. Even if we can find a Witherwood Saint Pellet, it will be too late at that time. If we don’t amputate it now, the yin flames might spread throughout his body. At that time, he’ll have to amputate his manhood.”

Mei Zihua was completely dumbfounded when he heard that, especially the last part. It even made him feel a chill run down his spine with his lips trembling.

“Brother Lin, i-is… that true?” Mei Zihua asked.

“Strictly speaking, that’s true.” Lin Yun nodded. Gu Jun wasn’t lying and Mei Zihua could be saved with the Witherwood Saint Pellet. But that wasn’t the only solution, his Blue Dragon Bone could also use a similar effect. But saving someone would exhaust him more than harming someone, and it would take the Blue Dragon Bone a long time to recover.

“It’s really heavy…” Lin Yun picked up the Black Thunder Chains and found that it was really heavy. It was strenuous for him, even with his physique, and he might injure himself if he wasn’t careful. If the Black Thunder Sacred Flame ignited, there was no way Mei Zihua could endure it with his physique.

But didn’t he refine this treasure? This should be a Glory Saint Artifact, and it had a long inheritance that was effective against the Ancient Demonspirit Clan. It could be used to restrain the enemy, and it would be more powerful than the Flower Burial Sword.

Roughly looking at it, Lin Yun found two glory spirits, the gloryfire and glorymetal spirits. This should be a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact.

“Brat, close your eyes. It won’t hurt and it will only take a moment.” When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Gu Jun pulling out a saint blade, and he was trying to find the best position to amputate Mei Zihua’s arm.

Mei Zihua’s face was so bitter, it was as though he wanted to cry. He was in despair now, and said, “Senior, be more careful with that.”

“Don’t worry about it. It will be fast.” Gu Jun smiled.

This scene made Lin Yun’s lips twitch, and he asked, “What are you guys doing?”

“Brother Lin, didn’t Senior Gu say that the yin flames will spread if I don’t amputate immediately…” Mei Zihua said with his face flushing.

“I’m trying to save him here.” Gu Jun said.

“Why don’t you amputate that leg of yours as well? Go away.” Lin Yun coldly said, chasing Gu Jun away. Mei Zihua was also really bold to dare take the old man’s words seriously.

“Don’t move.” Before Mei Zihua could do anything, Lin Yun placed his hand on his shoulder and activated the Blue Dragon Bone, pouring countless blue radiance into Mei Zihua’s arm.

This immediately made Mei Zihua’s arm crackle, and his face soon became pale from the pain. As Mei Zihua’s forehead was covered in sweat, he yelled out in pain, “Ouch, ouch, ouch…”

“It’s really effective!” Gu Jun was shocked. What he said earlier wasn’t nonsense because it was better for Mei Zihua to amputate as quickly as possible. Anyhow, he could recover that missing arm when he returns to his clan and a Great Saint could attach a new arm for him. If it was too late, the Black Thunder Sacred Flame would spread. At that time, not even an Emperor could save him.

This was the reason why Gu Jun was taken aback. The more he looked at it, the more amazed he became because Mei Zihua’s arm was slowly awakening like a dead tree coming back to life.

A while later, Mei Zihua’s expression gradually relaxed and he could feel his arm recovering.

“Give it a try.” Lin Yun said, releasing his grip on Mei Zihua’s shoulder.

“It’s okay now!” Mei Zihua said excitedly. He then turned to Lin Yun and said, “Thanks for saving me.”

Gu Jun rolled his eyes and had a rough guess in his heart. After all, he wasn’t as simple-minded as Mei Zihua. He smiled, “Brat, why don’t you treat my leg as well?”

“I suggest you amputate it along with that third leg in the middle.” Lin Yun immediately sat on the ground.

Upon hearing that, Mei Zihua burst into laughter, and said, “That sounds like a good idea.”

Gu Jun’s face turned dark when he heard that. After some time, Lin Yun began to refine the saint-grade Black Tortoise Cores, while Gu Jun and Mei Zihua treated their injuries.

Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art and a thunderstorm vortex appeared in his palm, absorbing one of the Black Tortoise Cores. When the Azure Dragon Grasp was formed, lightning could be heard coming from the Black Tortoise Core. There was a saint radiance being emitted, trying to resist the vortex.

However, the resistance posed no problem to Lin Yun, and his Azure Dragon Saint Physique wasn’t the same as before. When he activated the Azure Dragon Intent as well, the vortex became even more powerful and the saint radiance enveloping the core slowly crumbled.

When boundless and pure black tortoise aura flowed into his body, Lin Yun’s body began to start trembling with a dragon roar echoing out. In the next moment, the pure essence of black tortoise energy coursed through his body. More accurately, it should be thunder black tortoise energy.

The moment the energy entered his body, the golden-purple and blue-jade dragon runes went out of control and began to devour the energy. Their instincts were telling them that this energy could make them stronger, and it didn’t take long for him to finish refining the Black Tortoise Core.

“So fast!” Lin Yun was surprised. Ever since he refined the Divine Azure Blood in the Three-Lives Realm, it was rare for his body to show a thirst for something. Did that mean these Black Tortoise Cores weren’t simple? Then again, that was only for the saint-grade cores, since there wasn’t such a reaction when he refined the quasi-saint ones earlier. This could be considered a fortune in disguise!

“Let’s continue to refine them.” Lin Yun didn’t think too much and continued to refine more cores. As he refined more of the cores, new dragon runes were gradually being produced, and he broke through his limit. After he refined eighteen cores, the increased number of dragon runes gradually slowed down because they were stuffed.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, the depths of his pupils was flickering with lightning, and there was even a hint of silver light. He let out a breath and examined himself before realizing that the number of golden-purple and blue-jade dragon runes had each reached one hundred and ten thousand.

The increase wasn’t a lot, but it had a significant meaning because he broke through the bottleneck. Once he broke through the bottleneck, the upcoming path would be easier for him because he just needed to accumulate more. Who knows, he might be able to accumulate two hundred thousand or even a million dragon runes!

Lin Yun began to wonder if he couldn’t achieve the Azure Dragon Divine Physique because the number of dragon runes was too little. Now that he looked at it, there was a high possibility of this. After his two saint physiques combine into the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, the golden-purple and blue-jade dragon runes would transform into a whole new dragon rune. So if he didn’t have enough accumulation, he wouldn’t be able to combine them.

“My cultivation has also increased, and my dragon pulses seem to be at twenty-three thousand feet now…” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked when he examined himself. Based on his estimation, his dragon pulses would have to reach thirty thousand feet to make a breakthrough to the tenth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. He couldn’t imagine how powerful he would become after reaching the Profound Life Stage.

Right at this moment, Gu Jun also opened his eyes. He had already expelled the demonic aura that was in his leg, and smiled when he bumped gazes with Lin Yun, “We got a pretty good harvest. Come, have a drink.”

As he spoke, he threw the jar of wine over to Lin Yun. When Lin Yun grabbed the jar of wine, Gu Jun wore a smile and proudly reached for the Black Thunder Chains, “Hehe, this is pretty dangerous. So let me keep it safe for now. I’ll bear the pain.”

But his smile soon froze because Lin Yun snatched the Black Thunder Chains the moment he moved.

As Lin Yun held onto the jar of wine, he looked at Gu Jun with a smile, “Thanks, but no thanks. I believe youngsters like us should bear the pain of a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact.”

Hearing that, Gu Jun threw out a mouthful of blood because Lin Yun was becoming more shrewd.
