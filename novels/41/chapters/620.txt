Chapter 621 - The End?

The tables had turned in a split second, which no one was prepared for. The crowd was dumbfounded as to why Lin Yun and Ji Wuye were so strong. Despite facing the rain that contained Lin Yun’s sword intent, Ji Wuye managed to block it with his sword. It was no wonder that the two could remain the last ones standing.

Ji Wuye wiped the blood on his lips, and his face became even more sinister. Raising his head, his eyes flashed with a crimson glow as he glared at Lin Yun before revealing an even more eerie smile, “No wonder you can come this far. Not even Qin An and Pei Yue can force me this far.”

This caused Lin Yun’s face to change as he quickly circulated the Iris Sword Sutra within his body to resolve the incoming bloodlust. His sword aura might seem sturdy, but Ji Wuye’s bloodlust managed to bypass it.

The bloodlust was extremely troublesome and he would be in trouble if his sword intent wasn’t so powerful. But even so, he still suffered a considerable injury. Ji Wuye was the strongest opponent he had faced since coming to the Withernorth Sea.

Lin Yun had relied on the Seven Slaughtering Seal to face Ji Wuye outside the tomb and he would do it right now if he could. However, the difference in their cultivation was too great, and it was impossible for him to overcome the gap with the Iris Sword Sutra.

Ji Wuye’s cultivation wasn’t just at the pinnacle Yang stage. He wouldn’t be inferior to some of the experts that stepped into the Yin-Yang stage. So if he faced Ji Wuye with his fists, he would definitely be defeated in less than ten moves.

Fortunately for Lin Yun, the Flower Burial Sword had successfully upgraded to a cosmic artifact. Otherwise, it would have been a problem to destroy Ji Wuye’s crimson armor.

The smile on Ji Wuye’s face grew denser, which signified the rage brewing in his heart. Having his armor destroyed and being forced to draw his sword wasn’t the scene he wanted others to see.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes as he could sense an extremely dangerous aura coming from Ji Wuye. He heard that Ji Wuye was already in the pinnacle Yang stage one and a half year ago, which meant that he spent all this time tempering his bloodlust. Although he didn’t make a breakthrough in his cultivation, he has been constantly growing stronger. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“As you wish. I’ll be a little more serious then…” The crimson glow in Ji Wuye’s eyes suddenly grew which was followed by a torrential crimson storm that exploded from within his body. It made the starry sky that was reflected on the lake dimmer as Ji Wuye crimson glow grew brighter.

In the next second, it felt as though the outside world had been isolated, which shocked Lin Yun as he discovered that the surrounding spiritual energy was too dense for him to absorb. But that wasn’t all as the crimson glow also sent endless negative emotions towards his heart. It was so strong that hallucinations even started appearing in his mind.

If Lin Yun wasn’t cautious enough, his will would collapse. Ji Wuye’s pupils were red and he looked like a demon from hell. He looked at Lin Yun and smiled, “This is the Bloodfernal Domain that I’ve prepared for those in the inner ranking. Consider it an eye-opener that there’s always a world beyond your level. Your talent in swords is rare, but you’re still too tender. I’m undefeated as long as this domain remains!”

Lin Yun looked at the domain with a grave expression. He could sense that hallucinations weren’t the domain’s only function. His sword intent had practically been isolated and restrained. On the other hand, Ji Wuye’s sword was enveloped in a crimson glow that emitted a terrifying bloodlust.

“Impressive…” Lin Yun had to admit that Ji Wuye was impressive. He now understood why Ji Wuye received the nickname the Bloody Butcher. In fact, this domain itself was a lot more troublesome than the crimson armor.

“Die!” Ji Wuye flashed forward as he hacked his sword down. The crimson light had manifested into a sword image of nearly a hundred feet as it hacked towards Lin Yun.

Looking at the descending sword ray, Lin Yun frowned his brows as he could sense that the power within the sword ray was still increasing. If Qin An or Pei Yue were facing this attack, they would be heavily injured in an instant. The power of this sword wasn’t any inferior to his Overlord Sword.

Lin Yun’s sword suddenly dazzled as a bright moon rose up into the sky and clashed with the torrential bloodlust. In the next second, Lin Yun was knocked a few dozen steps away by the sword with fine cracks appearing in his sword aura.

“The game has just started!” Ji Wuye’s smile grew even more sinister seeing that there was finally a flaw in Lin Yun’s sword aura.

Lin Yun was only relying on his sword. As long as he destroys Lin Yun’s sword aura, he was confident of killing Lin Yun with a single punch. As he released a bark, the bloodmist that covered him began to spread out as howls and cries could be heard in the entire domain.

As his aura continued to rise, Ji Wuye stepped forward and hacked Lin Yun with his sword. Ten moves later, the blood mist in the sky formed numerous swords that emitted cries from hell.

“Blood Sword Purgatory!” Ji Wuye roared as the crimson swords enveloped Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun raised his head, his face changed as he could sense the danger that he was currently in. He knew that his sword intent wouldn’t have the chance to leave unharmed if he was really enveloped by the attack. Even his soul would be instantly devoured by the resentment contained within Ji Wuye’s attack.

The resentment within the attack originated from those who were killed by Ji Wuye. They were consumed with anger and hatred.

Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to activate the Seven Profound Steps. As the Golden Crow Seal bloomed behind him, he left behind nine afterimages. When the afterimages overlapped together, he unleashed the Thunderbolt Slasher.

This instantly lit up the entire domain. The nine sword rays overlapped together as they descended upon the domain and stirred up a series of miserable cries as countless crimson swords dissipated into black mist.

Just like that, the domain was stopped by the nine overlapping sword rays. It was like a corpse lifted in the sky that couldn’t descend. But even so, there were still many crimson swords that landed on his body. They emitted a sizzling sound as they started to corrode his skin. However, Lin Yun continued brandishing his sword as he didn’t dare to relax.

“You actually blocked it…” Ji Wuye was surprised but he soon smiled, “Let’s see how long you can persevere. Blood Dragon Prison!”

As Ji Wuye flicked his wrist, the domain instantly spread out like a huge net. It broke free from Lin Yun’s Thunderbolt Slasher and continued its descent. Under Ji Wuye’s manipulation, the crimson net released a series of howls as it descended rapidly. No matter how fast Lin Yun was, it seemed that avoiding this attack was impossible.

In the blink of an eye, the net had already enveloped Lin Yun as it swiftly shrank. But before it could finish shrinking, Lin Yun could feel the stinging pain on his body. He had a feeling that his outcome would be terrible if he was really bound by this net. But no matter how he swung his sword, his attacks only created sparks on the net.

Ji Wuye looked at this scene indifferently. In his view, what Lin Yun did right now was pointless. After a long while later, Ji Wuye finally spoke out, “It’s time to end this…”

The moment he brought out the Bloodfernal Domain, Lin Yun was already destined to be his plaything.

“Is he going to lose?” Many people’s eyes dimmed as they looked at the battle. Liu Yunyan’s face was pale as her hands trembled.

“He still lost in the end…” Mo Ling’s eyes were filled with dejection.

On the other hand, Zhang Yuan let out a breath of relief when he saw this scene as Lin Yun ultimately lost to Ji Wuye. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to accept Lin Yun defeating Ji Wuye.

“Still trying to struggle? Haha…” Ji Wuye let out a burst of laughter filled with mockery when he saw Lin Yun continue to struggle. The net wasn’t as simple as it looked, not to mention that the power had been amplified by the domain. Many people had no idea that he used this attack to kill a Yin-Yang elder of an overlord force in the past.

But all of a sudden, a brilliant sword cry rang out from Lin Yun’s body as the silver Iris Flower in his dantian began to spin. When the petals came out of his body, they manifested into numerous silver swords.

In the next second, the ninety-four swords had formed an ancient array around Lin Yun as he barked, “Iris Sword Array–Absolute Unrivaled!”
