Chapter 2386 - Don’t Pay Attention To Him

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son shook his head, “You’re from the Kunlun Realm, so how strong can your master be? If the Qilin Sword Immortal goes to the Kunlun Realm, he could level the entire Kunlun Realm by himself with his sword.”

“Perhaps,” Lin Yun merely smiled. He didn’t like to waste his saliva with others, and his attitude made the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son furious.

However, the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son didn’t flare up. Instead, he said, “You don’t think that you’ll have an opportunity to shine during the Heavenly Barren Banquet, right? Let me tell you that you won’t have that chance, nor will anyone from the ninth testing ground.”

“Big Brother Lin, let’s go. There’s no need to pay any attention to him,” Yue Weiwei said. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Okay,” Lin Yun smiled. He then left with Yue Weiwei.

This left the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son shocked because Yue Weiwei’s words were the same as stabbing his heart with a dagger. This was the first time he had encountered this kind of situation. There were many geniuses in the surroundings, the Heavenly Saint Courtyard’s Bai Ye and Li Ding, the Divine Shade Sect’s Ye Wushuang, and the primordial beast Di Feng. They were surprised when they saw this scene.

A brief moment later, someone said, “It looks like even a monkey dares to declare itself as a King when there’s no tiger around.”

Di Feng came over to the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, and said, “Brother, there’s no need to lower yourself to his level. He will regret refusing your offer.”

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son merely smiled and said nothing.

“If he had accepted your offer, I wouldn’t have had the chance to deal with him during the Heavenly Barren Banquet. Don’t be heartbroken for a woman, especially for someone who lowered herself to his level,” Di Feng continued.

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son shrugged with a smile, “This is nothing. I really appreciated his talent when I invited him, so it’s a pity that he won't join Qilin Mountain. That’s his loss, not mine.”

Everyone in the surroundings nodded, feeling that Lin Yun would regret refusing the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s offer. Once the Heavenly Barren Banquet begins, he would know the meaning of embarrassing himself.

Once Lin Yun’s group returned, Xi Yuan felt like she was dreaming. She would peek at Yue Weiwei and feel that what happened earlier was unrealistic.

Along the way, Yue Weiwei and Lin Yun smiled as they walked. Xi Yuan was smiling and didn’t neglect Ji Zixi and Lin Jiangxian. When they reached the gate, Xi Yuan said, “I’ll not send you guys any further.”

“We can participate in the banquet that will happen here five days from now?” Lin Yun asked.

Xi Yuan nodded.

“We’ll meet again five days later,” Lin Yun said and left.

Looking at Lin Yun’s group as they departed, Xi Yuan sighed, unable to figure Lin Yun out. She could imagine a clash between him and the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son five days from now. She initially felt that Lin Yun couldn’t rival the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, but it was different now since she believed in Yue Weiwei’s eyesight.

It didn’t take long before Lin Yun’s group came to a nearby courtyard, which they had rented. When they entered, Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue were casually chatting.

“You guys are back,” Ao Jue smiled. “It must be bustling in the Heavenly Saint Courtyard, right?”

“It’s not bad,” Lin Yun replied. He continued, “Let me introduce you guys, she’s Yue Weiwei.”

Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue were shocked when they saw Yue Weiwei, and their hearts began to beat wildly. Ji Zixi was already beautiful, but they didn’t expect that Yue Weiwei would be even more beautiful than Ji Zixi. The two were opposites in terms of their beauty. Yue Weiwei was more bewitching, which was why she exceeded the innocent Ji Zixi in terms of beauty.

“Holy shit. Lin Yun, what did you do? How did you bring back a peerless beauty in such a short time?” Xiong Tiannan couldn’t help asking, but he soon regretted it because it was a little rude.

But Yue Weiwei wasn’t bothered, and smiled, “We’re both from the Kunlun Realm, and I have been waiting for him in the Heavenly Saint Courtyard ever since I heard that he also arrived.”

Xiong Tiannan came to his senses, and smiled, “So it’s sister-in-law. I’m Tiannan, and you can introduce me if you have a younger sister.”

“Ao Jue.” Ao Jue’s reply was more simple.

“Hmph.” Ji Zixi snorted, unhappily looking at Xiong Tiannan before she left.

This covered Lin Yun’s forehead with wrinkles, and he didn’t know what to say.

Lin Jiangxian looked at Lin Yun with sympathy before she left. Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue also laughed before leaving this place. With that, Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei were the only ones left in this courtyard.

“It looks like she has fallen for you. I’m pretty smart to have predicted it back then,” Yue Weiwei winked, looking at Lin Yun with a smile and a hint of murderous intent.

Lin Yun bitterly smiled as he told Yue Weiwei about everything between him and Ji Zixi. When he was half-way through his explanation, Yue Weiwei’s face became grave. She said, “Your master will have a much higher chance with the Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s help, but you can’t be careless. Tian Xuanzi is more terrifying than you think.

“You have to make it into the top three no matter what during the banquet. It’s best if you can obtain first, then you have to obtain as many benefits as you can from the ancestral deity,” Yue Weiwei analyzed.

Lin Yun sighed. This was the reason why Yue Weiwei occupied a huge spot in his heart. Despite looking cheerful and playful, she would be analytical when things become serious, and she wouldn’t let her emotions control her.

He nodded since there were many geniuses attending this banquet, and he had to do his best to obtain as many benefits as he could. Yue Weiwei also shared with him the information she knew for him to be prepared.

When she was done speaking, Yue Weiwei smiled, “I’ll go look for her.”

Lin Yun was surprised upon hearing that.

Yue Weiwei smiled, “You might not say it, but I can tell that you care about her. Since she’s here, I have to help her get into the top ten no matter what and become the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity’s disciple. So I’ll take my leave now!”

After Yue Weiwei was finished speaking, she gave Lin Yun a kiss on his cheek and left, leaving Lin Yun behind.

This made Lin Yun helplessly smile because he wanted to spend more time with Yue Weiwei, but she didn’t give him the chance. This courtyard was massive, and it was no different to a manor.

When Yue Weiwei found Ji Zixi, she saw that Ji Zixi was in seclusion, wanting to calm herself down, but all her attempts ended in failure.

Ji Zixi knew that this banquet meant a lot to her, but she couldn’t calm down whenever she thought about Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei. Even so, she had to try and calm herself down somehow. Suddenly, Ji Zixi noticed someone gazing at her, so she asked, “Who is it?!”

Upon raising her head, Ji Zixi saw Yue Weiwei looking at her with a smile. She began to wonder why Yue Weiwei was here. Is she here to warn me? If she is really here to warn me, does that mean that I wouldn’t be able to see Big Brother Lin anymore in the future? But there was nothing she could say about that if Yue Weiwei really warned her.

Various thoughts crossed Ji Zixi’s mind, and she couldn’t help feeling heartache. When she came to her senses, she asked, “Big Sister Yue... can I help you with anything?”

“I’m here to take a look at you,” Yue Weiwei said. “If I’m not wrong, you’re planning to undo all the seals to your Phoenix Bloodline.”

“How do you know about that?” Ji Zixi was shocked. She was planning to undo the seals to her Phoenix Bloodline. If she didn’t undo the seals, she wouldn’t be able to unleash the full power of her bloodline as the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, and it would be tough for her to get into the top ten.

“You possess the Phoenix Bloodline, while I possess the Heavenly Fox Bloodline. I also had a seal in my body when I was young, like you,” Yue Weiwei smiled. When she said that, the distance between them became smaller. She stepped forth, and said, “There’s no way you can undo the seal this way. I have almost undone the seal to my Heavenly Fox Bloodline, so let me teach you.”

Ji Zixi’s face blushed. She didn’t expect Yue Weiwei to be here to help her, and said, “Big Sister Yue, I’m sorry... I...”

“Sorry?” Yue Weiwie smiled.

Ji Zixi shared her feelings with Yue Weiwei, and nervously said, “Big Sister Yue, you don’t have to warn me... I’m satisfied if I can look at Big Brother Lin from afar.”

Yue Weiwei was briefly stunned before she started laughing. Patting Ji Zixi’s head, she smiled, “What are you talking about? If you run into Su Ziyao in the future, don’t say that in front of her. You share the same thoughts as me in the past, but I thought it through now, and I don’t want to care about that.”

Su Ziyao? Who is that? Isn’t that the name of the Divine Dragon Empire’s Ninth Princess? Ji Zixi recovered from her shock, and her face became bashful.

“Alright, we can talk about it in the future,” Yue Weiwei smiled.

“Okay.” Ji Zixi nodded and cleared her mind.

At the same time, Lin Jiangxian was focused on trying to grasp the Five Elements Dao. As one of the nine Eternal Daos, it was her trump card. If she couldn’t grasp it, she wouldn’t be able to go far during the Heavenly Barren Banquet, so she had to grasp it no matter what.

At that time, her strength would undergo a transformation since the true profundity of the Heavenly Divine Sword required her to grasp the Five Elements Dao. Like her, Lin Yun was focused on the Flaming Yin-Yang Painting after Yue Weiwei left, attempting to grasp it.
