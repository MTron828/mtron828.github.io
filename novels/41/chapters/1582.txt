Chapter 1583 - God Restraining Seal

Half an hour later, they arrived in a valley where the cold wind was howling. The valley was spacious, the ground was rough due to the strong wind blowing back and forth, and the ground was covered in small rocks.

“Lord Lin, the thousand-year ominous wind aura is down below.” The Demonic Rune Tiger said.

Nothing seemed unusual when Lin Yun looked around. But when he looked down at the mountain stream, the cold wind howled like a ghost, and the valley bottom was pitch-black like an unfathomable abyss.

“This should be the right place. I can sense the ominous aura’s existence, and it’s very strong.” Lil’ Purple said with a grave expression.

“I’ll go down with Lil’ Purple. Lil’ Red, you stay here just in case anything happens.”

“Okay, Big Brother!” Lil’ Red was obedient and stayed on top while Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple jumped towards the mountain stream.

As the wind blew past the two of them, the dragon origin enveloping them became heavily damaged. It was like knives were slicing them back and forth. This startled the Demonic Rune Tiger because it didn’t expect Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple to be so decisive without the slightest hesitation.

“Lord Cat, you’re not going down?” The Demonic Rune Tiger asked with a fawning smile.

“I’m responsible for watching you. If anything goes wrong, you’ll be the first to die.” Lil’ Red looked at the Demonic Rune Tiger.

Hearing what Lil’ Red said, the Demonic Rune Tiger immediately stopped smiling, “Lord Cat… you can’t blame me.”

“Hehe, I’m just teaching you. I’m a reasonable person. Tell me, are there any treasures nearby? You stay here while I go treasure hunting.” Lil’ Red grinned.

The Demonic Rune Tiger’s eyes lit up, and it said, “I know, I know!”

As Lil’ Red rolled its eyes, it became increasingly excited as it listened to what the Demonic Rune Tiger said.

Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple fell for an entire hour before they landed firmly on the ground, and the violent wind made Lin Yun close his eyes. There was nothing there except for the violent wind. When he opened his eyes with great difficulty to look forth, he muttered, “What powerful wind…”

“Ominous auras are all like this. They’re born in harsh environments, and even Samsara Edict Realm powerhouses aren’t willing to come to this god-forsaken place. Other Dragon Pulse Realms won’t be able to last long here, and this is why ominous auras can exist for a long time.” Lil’ Purple smiled.

The two continued, heading deeper and facing the violent wind head-on before finally arriving at a spacious ground. A few thousand feet of a violent storm appeared before them, and Lin Yun stopped a few thousand meters away. He casually took out a saint artifact from his interspatial pouch and tossed it out. When that saint artifact faced the violent storm, the spiritual runes on the saint artifact began to crack and emitted a dazzling light. When the saint artifact got a few thousand meters close to the violent storm, it shattered.

Lin Yun reached out his hand at a fragment flying in Lil’ Purple’s direction. But he was soon surprised because that fragment actually tore apart his dragon origin and left a slight wound on his finger. Even the defense of his physique was torn apart, so one could imagine how mighty the wind was.

“This is a little troublesome. The ominous wind is clearly in that violent storm, but it’s difficult to obtain.” Lin Yun said with his brows furrowed.

“It’s an eight thousand year ominous wind aura we’re talking about here. You want to go and retrieve it forcibly?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Yeah. I want to give it a try.” Lin Yun executed his movement technique and released his Firmament Sword Intent before he turned into a streak and flew into the violet storm. When he entered the violent storm, he discovered that he had lost control of his body and couldn’t even see his surroundings.

“Split!” Lin Yun waved his palm and multiple figures flew out from his body with sword rays intertwined to form an ancient ‘heaven’ word. That word soon suppressed the violent storm, and he soon saw a white lump of light that looked like a ball. But he could see a face on it; it had eyes and a mouth with no nose.

“Found it.” Lin Yun executed the Azure Dragon Grasp and a draconic roar echoed. The thousand-year ominous wind aura briefly struggled before it lost control and flew towards his palm. It was powerful, and the power contained within it was boundless. Thus, despite it being pulled over, it wasn’t fast.

Pouring all his dragon runes from the Blue Dragon Bone into his palm, Lin Yun’s dragon aura continued suppressing the ominous wind aura. When forty thousand dragon runes flew out, the white ball no longer resisted and was pulled over. But just when Lin Yun was about to grab onto it with the dragon claw he had manifested, the white ball disappeared.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun was baffled. Before he came to his senses, the ominous wind aura manifested into nine hurricanes, each reaching a thousand feet in size. The wind was like fragments that were torn apart, and the massive dragon claw was crushed. Lin Yun’s sword aura also showed signs of collapsing as the hurricane continued to grind.

His face changed as he formed seals with his hand, and a pair of Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him. As the nine hurricanes continued to grind, the hurricanes seemed alive as they kept changing, trapping Lin Yun.

Lin Yun ultimately drew his sword and unleashed a sword ray that was a hundred feet long, but he was surprised because he couldn’t cut apart those hurricanes even with his attacks empowered with quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. “It can’t be cut apart?”

Before he could react, the nine hurricanes collided, causing Lin Yun to throw out blood and be sent flying away, slamming against a wall not too far away. The pain was horrible, and Lin Yun felt like his bones were falling apart. As he supported himself against the wall, he wore a grave expression while looking at the nine hurricanes combining into a giant.

When the rocks in the surroundings were swept up, the thousand-foot wind giant threw a punch. The punch gave off a feeling that it could tear apart anything before it, and the power contained within it was terrifying. In Lin Yun’s opinion, not even high-grade ghost spirit martial techniques could achieve this level, and he realized he was a little too over-confident.

This changed Lin Yun’s face, and what Lil’ Purple said was right. This ominous wind aura was equivalent to a ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Even if it didn’t have any intelligence, there was no way he could subdue it with his current cultivation. Speaking of which, where’s Lil’ Purple? Was she watching him suffering?

“What impudence!” When Lin Yun wanted to search for Lil’ Purple, a light rose behind him. When he turned back, he saw Lil’ Purple hovering in the air, and the light emitted from her soon filled every corner of this region. At this moment, she looked like a deity as her hands formed a seal. Whenever she sent a seal out, fine cracks would appear on the surface of the wind giant.

Seeing this, Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to swing his sword, executing the Carefree 9 Swords—Desolation Sword Form on the wind giant. This caused the cracks to expand and the wind giant swiftly shrank in size like a popped balloon, soon returning to the ball form.

“Restrain!” Lil’ Purple flew over and trapped the ominous wind aura that was about to dissipate. A vortex appeared as she waved her hand again, and the ominous wind aura was swept into her body.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Why didn’t you move earlier if you can do all that?” Lin Yun asked.

“Hmph. How will you know of this empress’ ability if you don’t suffer a little?” Lil’ Purple replied.

This made the corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitch because he was nearly killed by the ominous wind aura earlier, but he ultimately chose to endure it. The ominous wind aura was still with Lin Yun, and he could tell that the seal Lil’ Purple used was meant to deal with ominous auras.

When he asked, Lil’ Purple smugly replied, “At least you still have some eyesight. I’m a divine beast and have many ways to deal with these spirits born in nature. The one I used earlier is called the God Restraining Seal. At my full strength, I have many ominous generals under my command!”

“Impressive. So where’s the ominous wind aura?” Lin Yun praised with a smile.

“I’ll keep it for now. You can’t keep it in your interspatial pouch and can’t refine it anytime soon.” Lil’ Purple replied.

Lin Yun instantly knew that Lil’ Purple was taking revenge against him. After all, he ‘safekept’ the True Dragon Saint Liquid for five days before giving it to Lil’ Purple.

“Are you going?” Lil’ Purple asked, seeing Lin Yun dazing off.

“Let’s go, then.” As the Golden Crow Wings appeared behind him, Lin Yun grabbed onto Lil’ Purple and they flew out. Without the ominous wind aura, his movement technique was no longer restricted, and he returned to where the Demonic Rune Tiger was in the blink of an eye.

“Lord Lin, Lord Phoenix, you two are done subduing that ominous aura?” The Demonic Rune Tiger had disbelief in its eyes because this was too unbelievably fast.

“Yeah.” Lil’ Purple nodded.

“Lord Phoenix is truly impressive.” The Demonic Rune Tiger started flattering.

“That’s for sure.” Lil’ Purple yawned.

“Where’s Lil’ Red?” Lin Yun couldn’t see Lil’ Red anywhere.

“Hehe. Lord Cat when to dig for treasures.” The Demonic Rune Tiger said excitedly. Before Lil’ Red left, it said it would share 30% of the treasures with him, and it was enough to excite the Demonic Rune Tiger. If Lil’ Red didn’t instruct it to stay behind, the Demonic Rune Tiger would probably be with Lil’ Red by now.

“Lil’ Red is too playful.” Lil’ Purple furrowed her brows.

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised and smiled, “Let’s head for the ominous fire aura.”

The upcoming journey was smooth. With Lil’ Purple around, they quickly dealt with the ominous fire and lightning auras in just half a day.

“The ominous ice aura is in the Cold Pond?” Lin Yun smiled upon hearing what the Demonic Rune Tiger said. This saved him the trouble of running around, and he could also deal with the Heavenly Profound Tortoise while he was at it.

“Don’t be happy so soon. The God Restraining Seal has not much effect on the Heavenly Profound Tortoise!” Lil’ Purple said in a concerned tone.

“Don’t worry about that. I’ve made preparations before coming.” Lin Yun smiled confidently.
