Chapter 511 - First Meeting

Before Lin Yun and Liu Yunyan went up the Spiritwood Peak, they didn’t notice that there were two individuals gazings at them from the peak of the Imperial Study Hall. If Lin Yun was there, he would definitely be shocked. One of the individuals was Tang Yu and the other was Liu Yunyan’s master, Yu Mu.

“Interesting. If I remember correctly, he’s just eighteen, right?” Tang Yu suddenly asked with a peculiar light flashing through his eyes.

“Senior Brother Tang, what are you planning? That brat only came from the Great Qin Empire and his foundation is somewhat lacking.” Yu Mu was shocked by Tang Yu’s sudden words.

“Nothing much. But this Lin Yun is worth paying attention to. However, Yu Mu, you might’ve underestimated the Sword Firmament Pavilion. It’s definitely not as simple as you think. At their peak, they’re an existence that even the nine overlords don’t dare to look down on. Even if they’re at the very bottom, they still have two Heavenly Soul Realm experts guarding them,” smiled Tang Yu.

“How is that possible?” Yu Mu was shocked. A medium ranked force in the Nether Prefecture actually had two Heavenly Soul Realm experts? It was a little too exaggerated. After all, even the Heavenly Province Academy’s Heavenly Soul Realm experts didn’t exceed the fingers on one hand.

Then again, that was also due to the fact that the academy placed an emphasis on spiritual runes. Other quasi-overlord forces had more Heavenly Soul Realm experts. The Shattered Sword Pavilion had the most, but even so, their numbers definitely didn’t exceed the fingers on both hands.

As for one of the nine overlord forces, the Profound Yang Palace, no one knew anything about them. The Profound Yang Palace might have declined in recent years, but the number of Heavenly Soul Realm experts still suppressed the five quasi-overlord forces.

“Why not? If we go back in time, the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s origin isn’t any weaker than the nine overlord forces.” Tang Yu paused briefly before he continued, “Anyhow, this Lin Yun is worth our attention. Pay attention to him secretly. After all, our academy can’t lose out anymore, so we can’t let any opportunities go.”

Tang Yu's words seemed to have caused Yu Mu’s eyes to turn dark.

“Got it,” she replied.

“Just pay slight attention to him. There’s no need to be too focused. I just want to see that young lad’s potential,” clarified Tang Yu.

Once again, Yu Mu responded, “Understood.”

While this conversation was taking place, Lin Yun and Liu Yunyan traveled up the Spiritwood Peak. It might be a peak, but it was colossal and there was a huge distance between each residence. As the two ascended the peak, countless gazes were directed at them. After all, there weren’t many disciples here, so they were all familiar with each other’s aura. It was only natural that they paid attention to newcomers.

“Liu Yunyan?”

“She has also become a core disciple? Her improvement is quick. If I remember correctly, she hasn’t even reached the greater Yin stage, right?”

“Her cultivation might not be high, but I heard that she’s already a third grade spiritualist. She’s qualified to become a core disciple.” Many gazes were focused on Liu Yunyan. As the academy’s bella, Liu Yunyan was already used to such gazes. But there was one gaze that went nearly insane.

The one going insane was a black-clothed youth with ordinary looks, skinny frame, and caved in eyes. When he wasn’t laughing, he would give off an eerie aura. When he looked at Lin Yun, his gaze turned cold and he questioned the others, “Who’s that brat?”

Senior Brother Yang, you’re still so determined to win Liu Yunyan. That brat is Lin Yun. He came from the Great Qin Empire and I heard that he helped Liu Yunyan to become a core disciple. Furthermore, he’s arrogant. Not only did he defeat Mo Feng, but he even humiliated Mo Feng in front of Mo Ling,” chuckled a grey-clothed youth standing beside him.

“Oh?” The black-clothed youth smiled, “Interesting. It’s best if he doesn’t hinder me. I’m not as courteous as Senior Sister Mo.”

His eyes flashed with brutality, which made the youth beside him feel somewhat fearful. In his heart, he gave Lin Yun a moment of silence because misfortune was coming for Lin Yun. Not only did he offend Mo Ling, but he even eyed Liu Yunyan. It was a question if he could even stay here peacefully.

Coming to a place with dense mist, Liu Yunyan stopped and smiled, “We’re here.”

“Already?” Lin Yun was surprised because he didn’t see any signs of a courtyard.

“Try inserting some of your origin energy into the tablet in your hand,” smiled Liu Yunyan as she signalled for Lin Yun to take out the guest deacon’s identity tablet.

Lin Yun did as she said. In the next second, a wild storm blew and an elegant courtyard slowly unveiled itself before Lin Yun. Lin Yun wasn’t able to see the courtyard because it was covered by a thick mist, which blocked out his senses.

“The courtyards of guest deacons and core disciples are protected by an array. Not only is it secretive, but it’s also pretty safe. You can practice any martial techniques inside and no one will feel a thing, even if you cause a huge commotion,” explained Liu Yunyan with a smile.

“Not bad.” Lin Yun was satisfied with this residence, so he nodded his head. “Where are you staying? I’ll look for you when I’m free.”

“How can I tell you where a woman stays? I’ll come and look for you if I’m in a good mood,” smiled Liu Yunyan as she left. She didn’t even give Lin Yun a chance to explain himself.

Shaking his head helplessly, Lin Yun muttered to himself, “I don’t have any other thoughts. I just wish to find out more about spiritual runes.”

But he knew that Liu Yunyan was probably teasing him. She had something hidden in her heart and he could tell that she wasn’t interested in a romantic relationship.

Stepping into his courtyard, Lin Yun looked around before he activated his token. The surrounding mist came once more and covered the courtyard, but Lin Yun wasn’t affected by it. The spiritual array in this courtyard was rather impressive.

He decided to tour the courtyard and figure out where everything was. The arrangements in the courtyard were rather perfect. There was a small field for practicing martial techniques and a study room for spiritual runes. There was also a Spiritual Convergence Array for cultivation.

After touring around, Lin Yun arrived at the Spiritual Convergence Array. He looked at it briefly before his eyes were filled with excitement. The density of spiritual energy here was beyond his imagination. Cultivating here was comparable to using third grade spiritual jades. With that, one could imagine how terrifying this array was. Moreover, this was still halfway up the peak. It made one wonder how dense the spiritual energy was at the top.

The academy was truly worthy of being a quasi-overlord force with its foundation. With that, Lin Yun no longer delayed and began to cultivate. He circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and a silvery Iris Flower appeared beneath him.

The boundless spiritual energy coming from the array poured into his body and into the Iris Flower in his violet palace. The Iris Flower in his violet palace began to absorb the spiritual energy. At the same time, the two Primordial Chaotic Souls were also greedily absorbing the spiritual energy.

With the Spiritual Convergence Array, Lin Yun could finally satisfy the Iris Flower and two Primordial Chaotic Souls. Time slowly went by and Lin Yun only opened his eyes three days later. There was a smile on his face because he could feel that he might even reach the greater Yin stage if he cultivated here for two months, “Great!”

The spiritual energy here was so ample that he could absorb as much as he wanted with the Iris Sword Sutra. In the past, he didn’t dare to absorb spiritual energy so recklessly, even if he had a large number of third grade spiritual jades. However, this place was different. Cultivating here was a lot faster.

An ordinary cultivation technique was like a baby’s hand compared to the Iris Sword Sutra that was like an adult’s hand. An adult could naturally grab more things than a baby, so this treasured place made the differences even more significant.

The difference was like a firefly compared to a moon. In just three days, he could sense that it wouldn’t take long before he had another petal on the Iris Flower.

When Lin Yun came out of the Spiritual Convergence Array, he fell into deep thought. His martial techniques had come to a bottleneck, which was normal for cultivators. After all, it would be weird if things went smoothly for every cultivator.

The Aquaselenic Sword was only a transcendent spiritual martial technique and he had already brought it to the Manifestation Stage. Empowered with his xiantian sword intent, he could exhibit terrifying might with this sword technique, especially the Heavenly Cloud Shatter.

As for the Dragon-Tiger Fist, it was completely outdated. He could still use it against ordinary opponents, but not against monstrous geniuses like Mo Ling. So if he was blindly arrogant, he would die a terrible death. On the other hand, there was room for improvement in the Great Wind Scripture.

His greatest reliance was the Thunderbolt Slash right now. This move was terrifying and he could already unleash such prowess at lesser mastery. So there was no doubt that the power would increase drastically at greater mastery. Excluding Thunderbolt Slash, his true trump card was Dazzling Moment.

After reaching the ninth stage in the Iris Sword sutra, he could now circulate the Iris Flower backwards to unleash an attack that far exceeded his current cultivation. This ensured that anyone who dared to touch him would pay a great price, even if they could defeat him.

“I wonder if the Heavenly Province Academy has a fist technique. It’ll be great if I can encounter one that surpasses the Dragon-Tiger Fist.” But Lin Yun decided to place his focus on spiritual runes right now in hopes of deciphering the rose painting. As for fist techniques, he could only depend on his luck. After all, it wouldn’t be easy to get one.

Lin Yun had been in his residence for the past three days, so it was time for him to look around the academy. But the moment he stepped out, he immediately frowned. There was a black-clothed youth facing him with his back. Lin Yun didn’t know how long this person had been waiting for.

“I’ve been waiting for you for the past three days… you’re finally out.” The black-clothed youth suddenly turned around and when he looked at Lin Yun, Lin Yun could sense danger coming from the youth. The youth was an expert in the pinnacle greater Yin stage!

This person’s cultivation was comparable to Mo Ling. Disregarding his attainments in spiritual runes, his cultivation alone was a lot stronger.

“Sorry for disturbing you on our first meeting. My name is Yang Xiong. There’s something I wish to tell you. It might not sound good, but you better listen well,” said Yang Xiong coldly with his brow raised.
