Chapter 961 - Net

When Lin Yun grabbed the golden Divine Core with crimson flames, his gaze became complicated. He was really impressed by Baili Qi. After all, Baili Qi reached the Divine Core Realm and he was probably only ten years older than Lin Yun. Even in the Kunlun Realm, a Divine Core Realm expert was a powerful existence, not to mention such a young Divine Core Realm genius.

If Baili Qi was still alive, he would’ve easily reached a higher path. Baili Qi was young enough to do so because he had so much potential. But Lin Yun didn’t care about that. He was moved by the words Baili Qi uttered in the face of death.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

As for the title, War Sovereign, it was also a boundless honor in the Dragon Gate sect. But most importantly, Baili Qi seemed to have cultivated the Divine Flicking Sword. Otherwise, he couldn’t have killed all the fiends with a flick of his finger.

“The Flicking Divine Finger was left by Senior Iris Sword Saint. Can it be that he was also from Dragon’s Gate?” Lin Yun muttered. Then again, it might also be a coincidence. After all, it was just a secret technique and no one said anything about it being unique to the Iris Sword Saint.

“His Flicking Divine Finger seems more profound than mine. I can take this opportunity to comprehend it. But first, I have to quickly refine the Divine Core…” Lin Yun was satisfied with the Divine Core in his hands. After all, it was a lot more precious than the Heavenly Astral Pearl.

Lin Yun glanced at the ground where a few ancient runes remained. He could make out the vague outline of an array. This must have been the master array that Baili Qi used to control the larger array. Lin Yun wondered if the array could still be controlled.

Although it was heavily damaged, there were many spiritual runes that remained. He didn’t need to unleash its full power, but just enough to assist in refining the Divine Core. It would be useful for his second tribulation.

Lin Yun sat where Baili QI’s corpse was and started pouring his origin energy into the ground. Then, a dragon roar echoed as a faint dragon aura appeared and drew in astral energy.

“I see…” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up. The dragon aura from before originated here. Lin Yun could use the array as another layer of assurance to pass his tribulation.

Lil’ Red flew back to Lin Yun. Clearly, Lil’ Red wasn’t relieved that Xu Que left. Instead, it observed from afar and relayed the information to Lin Yun.

“Calling helpers?” Lin Yun wore a mocking smile. However, he didn’t have time to waste with fools. He could easily deal with them if he wanted, but he didn’t want to expose his sky sword intent.

Once he reached the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm, Xu Que’s advantage in cultivation would be erased. It would be easy to crush Xu Que without the sky sword intent.

“Lil’ Red, guard the outer area for me,” smiled Lin Lin. After seeing Lil’ Red nod its head, Lin Yun became serious. He had the right opportunity, so he would risk his life to reach the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

This time, he would rely on Baili Qi’s Divine Core to refine 3,000 divine astral pellets! After calming down, Lin Yun retrieved 3,000 divine astral pellets from his interspatial pouch.

Holding the Divine Core, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a firm light before he slowly closed his eyes. When he circulated his sword sutras, an unimaginable amount of astral energy started pouring into his body from the Divine Core. In just a brief moment, Lin Yun was enveloped with astral energy before he turned into a beam of light and shot into the sky.

With the boundless astral energy pouring into his body, Lin Yun’s hair began to flutter. He reached the limit of the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm a long time ago, so his second tribulation was overdue. Of course, Lin Yun suppressed it for as long as he could to find the right opportunity.

If he could refine many divine astral pellets and undergo the tribulation, he would undergo a drastic transformation. Then, his foundation would be akin to an unbreakable cage. Now that he had an opportunity and an ancient array protecting him, he wouldn’t face any real issues from the tribulation.

One day passed in the blink of an eye. Lin Yun already reached a crucial moment in refining the Divine Core. Meanwhile, it was starting to get lively outside of the demonic fog.

Everyone could see a pillar of light soaring into the sky from the demonic fog, which created a grand phenomenon. Occasionally, silver bolts of lightning would streak across the sky and restrict the entire space. It was so shocking that countless people came to watch.

When they learned that Lin Yun was refining a Divine Core, all of them grew envious. But when they wanted to take a closer look, they were chased away by Lil’ Red. Lil’ Red even killed a few people as a warning to the crowd. Their only choice was to stare at the demonic fog.

As another day had passed, more people gathered outside of the demonic fog. Gradually, people noticed something unusual about Lin Yun’s tribulation. They could sense that the amount of astral energy Lin Yun was trying to refine had reached an astronomical sum. He was making a breakthrough into the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm, but it felt like the fourth soul tribulation based on the surging astral energy in the atmosphere.

This realization left everyone shocked. After all, facing the tribulation was a dangerous thing, to begin with. One would lose their life if they weren't careful. Did Lin Yun really want to refine that much astral energy when he was only in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm?

“Is he insane?”

“How terrifying… If he fails to make it through his tribulation, he will be reduced to ashes. We might even get hit by the shockwave.”

“We should watch from afar.” Not many people dared to stand so close. But at the same time, another group of people came to watch. It was Xu Que, Mo Yan, Mu Ziyi, and Liu Mu. They were prepared to deal with Lin Yun, but when they saw the astral energy leaking out from the demonic fog, their faces changed drastically.

“Is Lin Yun really facing his tribulation?” Liu Mu was filled with disbelief.

“I’m absolutely certain that it’s him.” Xu Que nodded his head.

“That brat is really courting death. It looks like he’s not just refining the Divine Core,” said Mo Yan.

Squinting his eyes, Liu Mu replied, “Let’s send someone in to take a look.”

Shortly after, elites from their realms snuck into the demonic fog. But it didn’t take long for them to come running out. Liu Mu listened to their story and furrowed his brows. The Dragon Blooded Cat killed two of their people.

Even if the elites managed to get past the Dragon Blooded Cat, there was an ancient array protecting Lin Yun.

“That bastard! Are we really going to watch him get through his tribulation?!” Xu Que cursed.

“Haha, no need to worry about that.” Mu Ziyi laughed. “Let him undergo his tribulation. I just have to set up the Constellation Dragon Locking Array around the demonic fog. Even if he reaches the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm, I can guarantee that he won’t be able to unleash 50% of his strength. There’s no need for us to take any risks. Even if we break the array and make him fail his tribulation, we could get killed from the backlash.”

Mu ZIyi’s logic instantly woke everyone up from their rage. If they broke Lin Yun’s array, they were basically committing suicide.

“Your Constellation Dragon Locking Array…” Mo Yan looked at Mu Ziyi suspiciously. After all, the Constellation Dragon Locking Array nearly allowed the Gold-furred Dragon Ape to turn the tables around.

“Not this time. I used ten beast cores containing dragon bloodline to refine the spiritual diagram. As long as I have enough time, I can ensure that he won’t be able to escape it,” said Mu Ziyi coldly.

“We’ll go with that!” Liu Mu, who was the strongest of the four, gave orders, “Xu Que, use the Demon Bale Pellet of your Demon Slaughter Realm. Mo Yan, don’t hold back with your Crimson Flame Demonic Art. If we can’t get rid of Lin Yun this time, we won’t be able to deal with him in the future.”

“Don’t worry. We’ve already come this far. If we can’t get rid of that brat, we’ll be humiliated,” said Xu Que.

“The repercussions of the Crimson Blood Demonic Art aren’t small, but it seems like I don’t have a choice,” said Mo Yan.

Seeing that Xu Que and Mo Yan agreed with his plan, Liu Mu said, “Let’s move out then. Chase everyone away. We’ll set a net for that brat. No one can save him this time!”
