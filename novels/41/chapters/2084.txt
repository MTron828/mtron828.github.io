Chapter 2085: She’s Here!

After slaying Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan, Lin Yun sat down and made a breakthrough on the spot to the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. Everyone still hadn’t come to their senses from Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan’s death, and this scene shocked them again. The battle hadn’t ended yet, and yet Ye Qingtian made a breakthrough on the battlefield. This made them wonder if Ye Qingtian was drunk.

“Isn’t he a little too insane? Even a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase became his stepping stone.”

“This is too unbelievable.”

“To make a breakthrough on the battlefield. I have no idea how bold he is.” Everyone was shocked beyond words, but they didn’t have much to say. They were stunned by Ye Qingtian’s action.

A golden radiance shone on the table as a violent nirvana aura filled Lin Yun’s body before shining out from his pores. Basking in the golden radiance, Lin Yun’s injuries rapidly began to recover.

Lin Yun was dizzy because the Millennium Flame kicked in. So he couldn’t feel the satisfaction of making a breakthrough. He only felt that he was floating with the entire world being distorted. When he closed his eyes, many images began to flash before him. This was a mysterious feeling that Lin Yun didn’t want to wake up from, even after making a breakthrough. He wanted to carry on to reach the legendary tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

He had exerted his full strength in his fight with Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan, which was the most satisfying battle he had by far during the Sword Assembly. He might’ve seemed to have held the upper hand right from the beginning, but he was in a dangerous position. If Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan managed to break free from his sword aura and chose to fight him from afar, there was no doubt that Lin Yun would lose when facing saint dao.

But Lin Yun ultimately won the bet since Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan entered his sword aura, giving up his advantage. Even so, the fight was dangerous, and Lin Yun suffered heavy injuries. If he sobered up, he definitely wouldn’t be trying to make a breakthrough. But Lin Yun was still affected by the alcohol and wanted to bet on this opportunity.

Flower Burial Sword!?Lin Yun called out within his heart and the Flower Burial Sword began to fly around him, protecting him.

“Why is his aura still rising?” Jiang Yunting frowned.

Gu Zijing’s face changed as he thought of a possibility. He exclaimed, “He’s not planning to reach the legendary height, right?”

Jiang Yunting’s face also changed upon hearing that. He squinted and exclaimed, “He must be insane! It’s hard to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, not to mention he’s attempting to make a breakthrough on the battlefield!”

“If he fails, his meridians might be damaged, causing his cultivation to drop. In serious cases, he might even be turned into a cripple. Most importantly, he had just reached the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, so his accumulation shouldn’t be enough,” Gu Zijing said.

As soon as he finished speaking, a dazzling radiance shone from Lin Yun, reaching a thousand feet.

“Holy shit, what a powerful foundation. How much nirvana aura did Ye Qingtian accumulate at the Nirvana Stage?”

“Isn’t this a little too unfathomable? A thousand feet of radiance!”

“It’s no wonder why he’s so confident. It turns out that he benefited greatly in his fight with Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan.”

“I bet the Black Plume Palace must be going insane!” Discussions came from the surroundings, with everyone surprised by this scene.

The Black Plume Palace wanted to snatch the Sovereign Saint Sword. But not only did they lose so many Quasi-Saints, they even became Ye Qingtian’s stepping stones.

“Damn it! Go back and kill that brat!” The Heavenly Origin Phase Quasi-Saints fighting Mu Chuan were furious when they saw this scene. But how could Mu Chuan and those from the Sword Sect allow them to go after Lin Yun? As long as Lin Yun lives, the Sword Sect lives. If Lin Yun becomes strong, the Sword Sect will also become strong. So in a sense, protecting Lin Yun was the same as protecting the Sword Sect, and their fate was already tied together because Lin Yun represented the Sword Sect’s future.

The Quasi-Saints who were stopped were naturally furious.

“How long are you guys going to watch? Do you guys want him to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage?!” The old man roared at those from the Misty Rain Manor, Soaring Cloud Sect, and Aquamoon Sword Mountain.

The Heavenly Origin Phase Quasi-Saints from the three forces looked at each other. They were intimidated by Ye Qingtian’s earlier performance, so they didn’t make a move. After Ye Qingtian killed Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan, they no longer dared to make a move, and they had a shock on their faces when they saw that he wanted to make a breakthrough to the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. They began to consider the pros and cons and were in a dilemma.

“Let’s make our move. We have already come this far, and the losses will be too great if we fail to get the Sovereign Saint Sword.”

“Zhao Wuji is dead, and the Black Plume Palace might blame us for it if we still don’t make a move.”

“Let’s go, then.” The three holy lands made their decision and ten figures dashed forth. Practically all the Quasi-Saints made a move aside from Heavenly Origin Phase Quasi-Saints. They didn’t let those beneath the Quasi-Saint go because it was no different from sending them to their deaths. The Quasi-Saints quickly moved and reached within a hundred feet of Lin Yun in a few breaths.

“What a powerful sword aura!” The Quasi-Saints took a deep breath with grave expressions. They could sense how terrifying Ye Qingtian’s sword aura was at such a close distance. The sun and moon sword stars were hovering in the sky and were surrounded by thirty-six galaxies. Even Quasi-Saints at the Indigo Origin Phase could feel their scalps going numb when they sensed Ye Qingtian’s sword aura.

They could easily kill Ye Qingtian, but such a powerful sword aura could inflict heavy injuries on them. Unless someone grasped a saint dao from the three thousand great saint daos, ordinary lesser daos couldn’t protect them before such a sword aura.

Astral Sword Intent was heaven-defying, to begin with. Not to mention that even a Saint might not necessarily grasp the Astral Sword Intent. This had nothing to do with cultivation but talent as a swordsman.

Thus, the Quasi-Saints frowned and didn’t dare to carelessly step forth, fearing that Ye Qingtian might drag them down with him.

“Let’s test him!” An old man coldly said.

Seven people enveloped in an azure radiance charged at Ye Qingtian. But the moment they raised their hands, a light flew over.

“Duck!” The seven Quasi-Saints were shocked, but their murderous intent didn’t diminish.

The Flower Burial Sword was like a shadow following behind them. This was unbelievable because it was a sword without anyone controlling it and exhibited a shocking speed. As the sky became covered in swords, it looked as though there were thousands of swords shuttling around Ye Qingtian.

This dazzled the seven Quasi-Saints, and they couldn’t differentiate which was the real sword. But in reality, each sword was real since they were afterimages that were left behind by the Flower Burial Sword due to its extreme speed.

“Let’s just charge in!” The seven Quasi-Saints exchanged a look and moved together, wanting to knock the swords away.

But the three thousand swords combined, and a dragon’s roar exploded with a complete azure dragon being formed. The bones were made of swords, the blood was from thirty-six galaxies, and the two sword stars were the azure dragon’s eyes.

The seven Quasi-Saints threw out mouthfuls of blood with their faces pale as they took ten-odd steps back before they regained their footing.

“How is this possible?!” The seven Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints were shocked by this scene, while the three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints managed to notice something.

“So his Azure Dragon Sword Heart covers a hundred feet in radius. The sword heart can fuse with the sword, not to mention the thirty-six galaxies can further empower it. So he cannot be underestimated.”

“Most importantly, he’s attempting to make a breakthrough now. It’s no different from fighting with heaven, and we’ll be implicated if we get close to him.”

“Damn it! Why is this brat so tough to deal with?” The Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints frowned and cursed, all three looking impatient and anxious.

Ye Qingtian was someone of the younger generation, and they would be helpless against him if he managed to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. This was a huge setback for them, and it was no different from slapping their faces. They could feel a chill run down their spines when they thought about it. After all, Ye Qingtian’s attention wasn’t on them, he was making a breakthrough. So they couldn’t imagine how terrifying he would become when he opened his eyes.

“Let’s quickly kill him from a hundred feet away!” The three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints hovered in the air as their indigo saint aura enveloped them, forming multiple flowers around them. The flowers were formed by saint dao, containing the profundity of heaven and earth. They were terrifying, even if they were lesser daos, and they were terrifyingly lethal against those at the Nirvana Stage.

“Die!” The three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints made their move as they released their attacks, empowered by their saint daos and indigo saint auras. The three used ghost spirit martial techniques, and their attacks created a terrifying phenomenon under the empowerment of saint aura.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun was still attempting to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. The process was like trying to soar to the sky, but he could be knocked back when he reached the clouds. Lin Yun didn’t know how many times he had failed; each time would bring him intense pain.

Lin Yun realized that it was still too forceful for him to make a breakthrough now, and that the bottleneck of the tenth transformation was tougher than he had imagined. When the three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints made their moves, Lin Yun immediately sensed a dangerous aura.

Seven powerful auras followed behind the three attacks as the seven Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints made their moves, soaring into the sky behind the three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints as they prepared their attacks, putting Lin Yun in a dangerous position.

You people are courting death!?Lin Yun inwardly snorted. But just when he was about to open his eyes, an indigo figure soared to the sky with a powerful imperial aura sweeping out, forming into an indigo waterfall that crashed down as that figure landed a hundred feet away from Lin Yun. She didn’t draw her sword but raised the sheathed sword before her.

The three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints were sent flying away, throwing out mouthfuls of blood with shock reflected in their eyes.

She unleashed a sword aura that sent the seven Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints flying away when she drew her sword. The saint aura around them was like paper being torn apart, and the sword ray left a deep wound on their chests with blood gushing out.

“Who dares to step forth?!” A cold roar echoed, containing an imperial aura in her tone that made the three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints take a few steps back.

Ye Ziling was already in despair when she saw so many Quasi-Saints going after Lin Yun, but her brows eased up when she saw the indigo figure. She knew that Lin Yun was now safe with the arrival of this person.
