Chapter 2483 - Yan Chen, Let Me Send You Home

Twenty-odd Sovereign Saint Artifacts, empowered with the aura of the Quasi-Deity Realm, each weapon could slay an Emperor. The overwhelming weapons instantly gave Lin Yun a headache.

“Holy shit, she’s not going easy at all...” Lin Yun took a deep breath and unleashed ten-odd swords, blocking ten-odd Sovereign Saint Artifacts simultaneously. Each impact would cause an earth-shattering sound that could be heard in the entire Ancient Saint Domain.

The Empress had no change on her face and shot an arrow, but it wasn’t directed at Lin Yun. She continued drawing her bow with the shining runes on the Divine Dragon Vault behind her, representing time and space.

After shooting another arrow, the Empress drew her bow again. But this time, the arrow was aimed at Lin Yun. She was patient and maintained the third arrow, brewing its power as she looked at Lin Yun coldly.

“Nirvana Dao!” There were too many Sovereign Saint Artifacts, and Lin Yun finally executed the Nirvana Dao. The time-space barrier behind him shattered, and he returned to the past, knocking back the incoming Sovereign Saint Artifacts he couldn’t previously block.

Just when Lin Yun wanted to return to the past, an arrow shot over, shattering time-space, and flew toward him. This arrow contained terrifying power, and Lin Yun would lose his life if he were struck.

This made Lin Yun feel a chill as this was the first time he felt his life threatened. This arrow seemed to contain an aura that was the bane of the Dragon Clan’s bloodline.

“Damn it!” Lin Yun had no choice but to execute the Nirvana Dao once more. This time, it was tough for him to shatter the time-space barrier. Countless invisible hands were dragging onto him, leaving cracks in the time-space behind him.

However, Lin Yun ultimately managed to break the barrier of time-space. When the arrow was about to hit him, Lin Yun returned in time. But before he could gain a footing, another arrow shot into his forehead before he could respond.

The sword sea in Lin Yun’s forehead began to rumble with sword intent gushing and his forehead releasing a dazzling radiance. Lin Yun threw out a mouthful of blood with his soul trembling, and he was briefly distracted.

There was no way this arrow could be avoided, and the Empress had timed everything. He was lucky that his sword intent was beyond the ninth grade, and he relied on his Eternal Sword Intent to withstand this arrow. Otherwise, his head would’ve been blown apart.

Even so, Lin Yun was on the verge of death. But in the nick of time, energy gushed out from the Blue Dragon Bone with brimming vitality that dragged him back from the border of death. When Lin Yun recovered, he saw another arrow aimed at his forehead when he reopened his eyes.

“Everything is nothing beneath Nirvana!” Lin Yun roared as an eternal flower representing Nirvana Dao bloomed. He brought out the Nirvana Dao with great courage and returned to knock the arrow away. With that, the life-and-death crisis was resolved.

The entire world became blurred as Lin Yun squinted. He could see a figure carrying a sword box on his back ten thousand miles ahead and another farther away. There were three figures, three overlapped time-space.

“Shit! I have to go back quickly!” Lin Yun’s face was pale, with beads of sweat on his forehead. He could sense the world’s rejection, and everything around him swiftly blurred. After all, he executed Nirvana Dao three times, and it was like three illusions being repelled by the world.

Lin Yun dashed forward, taking a deep breath, wanting to catch up with those figures. Countless invincible hands were trying to drag him into the abyss. He gritted his teeth and ran forward. It was taxing for him, but he was slowly approaching his target.

Right then, a punch shattered the three overlapped time-space as the Empress appeared before him with the black box on her back, executing the Imperial Dragon Fist.

Lin Yun blocked the incoming punch with the Flower Burial Sword, and he was knocked back after running forward for so long and fell into the time-space abyss.

“Mhm?” Seeing that her punch was blocked, the Empress was surprised. She soared to the sky, wanting to leave, but was shocked to discover she couldn’t leave the stage. This was because the time-space around the stage had become so chaotic that even someone in the Quasi-Deity Realm like her couldn’t break through. This includes the Divine Dragon Vault that she carried.

The entire time-space became chaotic, with scenes flashing in the surroundings and going back in time. The stage was like an island in the vortex.

Seeing Lin Yun and the Empress disappear, everyone was shocked and couldn’t comprehend what was happening.

The Empress hovered in the sky and stood in confrontation with Lin Yun. Looking at the empress, Lin Yun smiled, “Not only did you force me into this desperate strait, but you also came in with me.”

Facing this desperate strait, even someone in the Quasi-Deity Realm would be dead. Only one fate awaited them, which was to be devoured by the chaotic flow of time-space.

The current stage relied on the Iris Sword Box and Divine Dragon Vault. Otherwise, the stage would’ve been devoured long ago.

“I shot out three arrows, and you will be hit by one. I speculated that the Dragon Annihilation Arrow won’t kill you with your strength and must follow up with another punch. But I didn’t expect you to block it,” the Empress said.

Lin Yun looked at the Empress with a complicated gaze and smiled bitterly, “Thank you for not holding back. Otherwise, I wouldn’t know that the Nirvana Dao wasn’t invincible.”

The Empress descended and looked around. A brief moment later, she said, “We went back a thousand years ago.”

“How do you know?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s because I experienced this a thousand years ago,” the Empress said, looking at the blurred images.

Lin Yun’s thoughts processed, and he smiled, “Your Majesty, do you have a way to resolve this issue? I can stay here if you need help.”

The Empress looked at Lin Yun with shock and said with a complicated gaze, “You’re calmer than I thought.”

“I fought you with the preparation to die. Fighting a Quasi-Deity, I only have a forty percent chance of winning. It’s either you die, or I die; one of us will have to stay behind because Kunlun Realm needs an answer no matter what,” Lin Yun smiled. What he meant was simple. If there was no choice, Lin Yun was willing to sacrifice himself to ensure that the Empress made it back.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, the Empress wore a smile, but her smile looked desolate. She said coldly, “You’re alike with the Southern Emperor. But who would be afraid of death? There are many things in the world more terrifying than death. You want to die and leave everything to me?”

The Empress’s tone was cold, making Lin Yun rub his nose with a bitter smile.

Turning around, the Empress looked at Lin Yun, and her face became gentler. She said, “Sit down. Unless one of us grasped Karma Dao, we will be trapped in this time-space abyss until our death.”

Upon hearing that, Lin Yun fell into deep thought because that seemed like the case; karma was the invisible hand holding them down.

“Senior, do you have a way out?” Lin Yun noticed that the Empress had been looking around ever since they were trapped here, and she didn’t have much fluctuation on her face. This woman kept a cold expression even when she was facing death.

The Empress closed her eyes and ignored what Lin Yun said. Seeing this, Lin Yun instantly knew the Empress must have a way.

“If we can return, let’s not fight any longer. Why can’t we bear Kunlun Realm’s tribulation together? You’re closest to the Deity Realm in the Kunlun Realm, and you can reach it the moment I reforge the Heavenly Path. There’s no need to sacrifice the eight dragon veins,” Lin Yun smiled.

“You think I’m purposely making things difficult for you? If you can’t even beat me, there’s no way you can resolve the threat in the God Burial Mountain Range,” the Empress smiled.

“How strong are you?” Lin Yun asked with a serious expression.

“Regardless of how powerful your sword intent has become, there’s no way you can kill me, not even with three Eternal Daos. I won’t lose as long as I have a breath left. This meant that even if you managed to defeat me, you couldn’t kill me and only seal me,” the Empress replied.

“The Quasi-Deity Realm is that powerful?” Lin Yun muttered to himself.

“The Quasi-Deity Realm is also a deity. There’s no way the saint dao can kill a deity...” the Empress replied.

“Only heavenly dao can,” Lin Yun said.

“You comprehended rather quickly. But heavenly dao isn’t something that can be achieved by fusing your sword dao with heaven. I’m talking about genuine heavenly dao that can wipe out the divine flame,” the Empress said, raising her brow. “So, don’t think that I will go easy on you. You should die in my hands than to die in the God Burial Mountain Range. I can’t imagine how powerful you would become if your corpse were refined into a Demonic Corpse.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thought and asked, “Actually, the sword intent above the ninth grade isn’t that simple. Yu Qingfeng used his life to open the gate, and that’s a whole new path. I’m a genuine Sword Immortal.”

He was a genuine Sword Immortal, using the sword to wield eternal. He would become an immortal with the sword.

“Oh?” The Empress said, “Let me experience it.”

“I grasped it recently, and only the surface of it,” Lin Yun replied.

“Tell me about it. Perhaps I can guide you with it...” the Empress said.

“Okay!” Lin Yun smiled. He wasn’t afraid that his trump card would be exposed and shared his comprehension with the Empress. He didn’t expect the Empress to have some understanding of that as well, allowing him to gain insights.

This made Lin Yun suspect that the Empress had also seen that gate but for a different dao. No one knew how long they chatted, but the Empress suddenly stood up and looked at a blurred image in the time-space abyss. There was a palm-sized shattered mirror and many blurred scenes in it.

“Ye Tiannan, it’s time to return what you owed me!” The Empress’ expression became resentful and painful, yelling at the time-space vortex. The runes on the Divine Dragon Vault shone, allowing her voice to transmit.

As time-space became distorted, the shattered pieces began to piece together. As the image became apparent, Lin Yun saw a world, Mount Tai, from three thousand years ago. There was a mountain of corpses and a river of blood beneath the Southern Emperor’s feet.

He had heard the Empress’ words and began looking around in confusion. But when a flower representing an Eternal Dao behind him bloomed, he seemed to have detected it and looked at the Empress.

The Empress couldn’t contain her emotions, and tears covered her face. She tried her best to suppress her emotions, suppressing the urge to dash over and give the Southern Emperor a beating.

“Yan Chen, let me send you home.” The Southern Emperor smiled exhaustedly before flicking his finger, unleashing a sword ray into that world. Simultaneously, the Flower Burial Sword in Lin Yun’s hand also began to tremble. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The Southern Emperor’s Flower Burial Sword opened a path in the abyss, revealing a path intertwined with countless karma. There were also threads flying over from Kunlun Realm, which were karma belonging to the Empress and Lin Yun, dragging them back to Kunlun Realm.
