Chapter 694 - Reaching the Pinnacle Yang Stage

The plain became silent as Lu Tong’s severed corpse was a brutal outcome. This outcome was another resounding slap to their faces. Just fifteen minutes ago, everyone had great hopes for Lu Tong to deal with Lin Yun. But his outcome was even more terrible than Xiang Tianhe’s.

After all, Xiang Tianhe exchanged dozens of moves with Lin Yun and caused some trouble for Lin Yun. But Lu Tong was merely killed with a single attack, destroying his hope of being the eighth strongest genius. Even before his death, he had no idea how he died.

Right at this moment, a chill came from afar that shocked everyone. On a mountain not far away stood a graceful woman emitting a noble aura. She was naturally Qing Ruoyou.

Her appearance had shocked everyone as they heard that she was cultivating in the Falling Aquatic Mountain and even rejected Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu’s requests. They never expected that she would be here, but when they reasoned it out, their faces soon turned black.

She naturally knew that Lin Yun would come for the secret realms, so she came to see Lin Yun get killed. After all, she had been unhappy with Lin Yun, and she wanted to see Lin Yun get suppressed and humiliated. But she never expected that she would see the scene of Lin Yun suppressing everyone.

The scene of Lin Yun suppressing everyone had caused a ripple in her heart, which was why she couldn’t suppress the chilly aura around her. But seeing that everyone had noticed her, Qing Ruoyun turned around without any hesitation.

After she left, several geniuses that were standing behind her were revealed. They were all geniuses from Indigomoon Elysium. They had disdain on their faces before they shook their heads and turned away.

“This is finished!”

“We embarrassed ourselves before Her Highness Ruoyou again. Damn it!”

“The three overlord forces will host a recruiting session half a month from now. The Indigomoon Elysium must’ve come beforehand.”

“They must be disappointed with Skymound City. Damn it, Lin Yun has embarrassed us!”

“He killed two of our geniuses. Everyone, charge into the secret realm and capture him!”

“Enter the secret realm and slay Lin Yun!” The crowd’s hearts began to boil with killing intent as they planned to hunt Lin Yun together. Even if they couldn’t hunt Lin Yun, they still had to let the seven geniuses know that Lin Yun entered the secret realm.

Beyond the plain were many demonic cultivators gathered outside with powerful auras. Looking at Skymound City’s cultivators roaring furiously, they all sneered coldly with a mocking expression. Even if those cultivators were banded together, it still wouldn’t change the fact that they were trash.

But Lin Yun was really tempting even for them. If they could kill Lin Yun, they would probably make a fortune from his head. With just a thought, their eyes flashed coldly. To demonic cultivators like them, they would only prioritize benefits. They would definitely be able to obtain a shocking harvest if they could kill Lin Yun.

Meanwhile, the geniuses gathered on the plain couldn’t bear it anymore as they soared into the sky. But in the end, those who were weaker than average bounced back, covered in blood. As for the others, they disappeared into the secret realm.

As for the wandering cultivators, they were patient. After all, it would be safer for them to enter when the crack fully opened.

Within the Sword Sect’s secret realm, a killing aura filled the atmosphere. But it didn’t take long for the silence to be broken as more people began to appear in the secret realm. All those who entered the secret realm were randomly teleported to a location. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Lin Yun landed on a low hill as he looked into the distance. His heart was beating wildly as he felt more satisfied after killing Lu Tong. The faint purple mist shrouding him actually had lightning. The silver Iris Flower in his violet palace seemed as though it was dyed in blood. It looked bewitching as a surge of pure energy came from within his body.

Just when Lin Yun was feeling doubtful, his cultivation suddenly reached the pinnacle Yang stage with even more boundless origin energy surging from within his violet palace.

“Did my cultivation make a breakthrough?” Lin Yun muttered to himself. He should’ve already made a breakthrough as he had been in the greater Yang stage for a long time. He killed two people in a row, so he smoothly made a breakthrough.

If the geniuses from Skymound City knew that he made a breakthrough after killing two people, they would surely throw up blood. Letting out a sigh, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed sharply. Now, he wanted to find an opportunity to reach the Yin-Yang stage. If possible, he also wanted to bring his cultivation in the sword path to a new stage.

At the very least, he had to come in contact with the edge of spiritual sword intent. This was the Sword Sect’s secret realm, so there must be many ancient records of sword techniques. So he knew that he could achieve his objective if he could obtain bits and pieces.

“This place seems a little too quiet…” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with doubt as he could see many cultivators descending. They were like pebbles thrown into a peaceful lake.

But the moment he finished speaking, a hill suddenly trembled before he saw a deep crater on the ground that was far away. In the next second, a three hundred meter long centipede pounced out from the ground and devoured two cultivators.

After the centipede finished feasting, it turned to look at Lin Yun. Lin Yun was still enveloped in the purple mist. The centipede looked at Lin Yun cautiously before it went back into the ground. It seemed to be afraid of Lin Yun.

“This demonic beast has a rather keen sense.” Lin Yun frowned his brows as he looked at the mist enveloping him. He wasn’t a show-off, but he had no better alternative to deal with this matter. His vitality was too strong to the point that a dragon aura was emitting out of his pores.

This wasn’t exactly a good state as his vitality was being consumed at all times. Although it was nothing compared to the massive aura within his body, it was still not a piece of good news. But his cultivation was too weak compared to his physique, so he couldn’t suppress the azure dragon energy completely.

He was trying his best to suppress his aura, which was why it became a purple mist enveloping him.

“The demonic beasts here are strong, so I have to be careful. After all, my brimming vitality is like a walking elixir to the demonic beasts.” Lin Yun took a deep breath as he sensed the dense spiritual energy lingering in the atmosphere. This place was massive and he had to find the direction to the secret realm’s core.
