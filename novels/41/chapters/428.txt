Chapter 429 - Painting Shattered, Kill

Luo Yuhang was surprised that Lin Yun was his first opponent. The Dragon Gate Competition was held once every three years, so it would naturally attract everyone’s attention. Since it was structured like this, it was an honor that he could fight in the first match. If he could display his talent in the first match, his fame would spread throughout the empire. Most importantly, his opponent was Lin Yun, who was at the center of everyone’s attention.

“I’m pretty lucky that I got what I wanted.” Luo Yuhang had been looking forward to his battle with Lin Yun ever since his loss. He wanted to step on Lin Yun with his feet to cleanse the humiliation he suffered back then. It would also be interesting to humiliate the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

At this moment, the spectators were busy discussing among themselves. They had already guessed that Lin Yun would go up for the first fight, but no one had expected that his opponent would be Luo Yuhang. Everyone knew about Luo Yuhang’s ranking on the Newly Risen Ranking, not to mention he was also Twilight’s junior brother.

The opponents of the titled figures and the geniuses, like Bai Lixuan, were nameless figures. So it was unexpected that Lin Yun’s opponent would be a popular candidate who had a legitimate shot at obtaining a title.

“Not good. Lin Yun might have recovered his cultivation, but all his trump cards are revealed, not to mention that he hasn’t fully recovered from his old injuries. His odds of winning won’t be high against Luo Yuhang.”

“Could it be something planned by the royal family on purpose?”

“Who knows. After all, it’s too humiliating to lose the first match.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Yeah. When Lin Yun came to register, everyone’s attention was on him. It’ll be too humiliating if he loses the first match.”

Many of the judges came from the royal family, so they naturally had to give face to the royal family. The crown prince had just been recently embarrassed by Lin Yun, so it wouldn’t be weird if they didn’t interfere in the matches as long as it was within the rules.

Just as Lin Yun walked to the eighth stage, Xin Yan suddenly called out, “Junior Brother.”

Lin Yun paused his footsteps, but he didn’t turn around. Xin Yan continued, “Survive. You hear me?”

“I will,” smiled Lin Yun.

Luo Yuhang was already waiting on the eighth stage and the other participants were also on the seven other stages. With that, the Dragon Gate Competition had officially begun.

Everyone from the Sword Firmament Pavilion was looking at Lin Yun and some were worried if Lin Yun could defeat Luo Yuhang.

“I have been waiting for some time. Are you afraid of fighting me?” smiled Luo Yuhang. He had been waiting for this opportunity for a long time, an opportunity to defeat Lin Yun at his strongest. Luo Yuhang continued, “I’m surprised that you came. I wouldn’t have come if I was in your position. After all, it would be too humiliating to be eliminated in the first match.”

Is it finally starting? Lin Yun ignored Luo Yuhang and turned back to look at Xin Yan, then the Bloomphoenix Princess, and finally the strand of hair wrapped around his pinky. He came from the Aquasky Nation, bearing the name of a sword slave. It wasn’t an easy journey to get here, but he was finally on the Dragon Gate Competition’s stage. He was here on behalf of Xin Jue to fight for Xin Yan.

Suddenly, a commotion broke out on the fifth stage. Qin Yu had merely pushed his palm out, unleashing a sea of flames that engulfed his opponent instantly. His opponent’s body was entirely burnt by the attack, which was a brutal scene.

Qin Yu stood proudly on the stage. He had been too suppressed since the wedding, so he needed an avenue to vent his emotions. However, this was unfortunate for his opponent. Qin Yu’s palm was his way of trying to promote his existence, telling everyone that he was the star.

“Don’t worry. You won’t have an opportunity to fight him.” Luo Yuhang thought that Lin Yun was paying attention to Qin Yu when he saw that Lin Yun wasn’t focused. In the next second, he unleashed his tyrannical aura. His eyes became sharp as he tightened his grip on his sword.

“How powerful!” The spectators could clearly sense the powerful aura coming from Luo Yuhang. They instantly knew that Luo Yuhang wanted to end this battle quickly by suppressing Lin Yun with his cultivation.

“You can surrender before I draw my sword. Otherwise, no one can save you,” roared Luo Yuhang with a killing aura emitting from his eyes.

Ending the battle quickly? Just what I wanted. The Iris Flower bloomed in Lin Yun’s dantian and his powerful origin energy reverberated through his profound veins. At the same time, his aura began to blaze.

“Attack. Cherish your last chance to draw your sword,” replied Lin Yun. His voice wasn’t loud, but the confidence in his tone left many people shocked. Lin Yun was truly facing Luo Yuhang with an indifferent attitude.

One must know that Lin Yun had already revealed all his trump cards. Even if he had recovered his cultivation, he was still in a disadvantageous position given his cultivation.

The battles on the other stages ended quickly just as everyone had expected. After all, the opponents of the titled figures either surrendered or were easily defeated. Instantly, everyone’s attention was on the eighth stage.

“You’re still as arrogant as before!” sneered Luo Yuhang as he drew his sword. When Luo Yuhang drew his sword out by half an inch, he turned into a streak of light and dashed forward. The stage suddenly turned dark and aside from the sword ray that enveloped him, everything else, including Lin Yun, had become dark under his sword ray.

His sword was brilliant, but when the stage became dark, the dazzling sword ray suddenly disappeared.

“What’s going on?”

“It should be the Sword Cloud Pavilion’s Supreme Radiance Sword. It’s a sword technique that’s hard to defend against.”

“Luo Yuhang is truly not simple to be able to utilize the Supreme Radiance Sword to this degree.”

“I heard that it’s extremely hard to practice this sword technique and that it’s rare to even achieve lesser mastery. Many elders in the Sword Cloud Pavilion couldn’t even grasp the profundity of this technique.” Everyone became worried for Lin Yun. After all, Luo Yuhang was truly powerful to be ranked in the top five.

Suddenly, a radiance lit up the stage and everyone was shocked to see that Luo Yuhang was standing before Lin Yun in the next second with his sword aimed at Lin Yun’s head. But even so, Lin Yun didn’t budge his feet or even open his eyes.

“What’s Lin Yun trying to do?” Many people were baffled when they saw Lin Yun closing his eyes. This sword was fast and everyone felt that Lin Yun would have difficulty dodging it even with his eyes opened. So Lin Yun closing his eyes was an act of courting death in the eyes of many people.

Are you courting death? Since that’s the case, then I’ll fulfil your wish! Luo Yuhang’s face became dark as more killing intent filled in his eyes and he stabbed his sword forward.

But all of a sudden, Lin Yun suddenly emitted a profound sword aura that started to fluctuate like water. Lin Yun was like a moving river covered in mist.

“Futile tricks!” snorted Luo Yuhang. He didn’t believe that Lin Yun could do anything before his absolute strength. In the blink of an eye, Luo Yuhang had stabbed his sword over ten times, each stab being faster than lightning.

When Luo Yuhang stepped into the domain of Lin Yun’s sword aura, Lin Yun could sense his every sword even with his eyes closed. Suddenly, Lin Yun moved. His figure began to dissipate like ink and he left behind afterimages.

“I’ll see how long you can keep retreating!” Luo Yuhang’s expression became savage as he relied on his advantage in cultivation to crush Lin Yun’s sword aura. No matter how brilliant Lin Yun’s movement technique, Luo Yuhang still held the upper hand in this exchange. However, he paid the price with his origin energy being swiftly exhausted.

“Supreme Radiance Sword–Daylight!” Luo Yuhang instantly knew that he couldn’t continue this any further or he would run out of energy first. He instantly brought out his ultimate move and his sword radiated with great brilliance like a sun that could incinerate everything.

A cold gleam flickered across Luo Yuhang’s eyes and he snorted, “Come back three years later. Get lost!”

Many people told Lin Yun to participate in the Dragon Gate Competition three years later, but it was too long for Lin Yun. Since he couldn’t retreat any further, then he couldn’t retreat. But who said that the Seven Profound Steps could only retreat?

Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes and unleashed a shocking aura from his body. Without any hesitation, he took a step forward toward Luo Yuhang’s attack. When he turned around, he saw a painting. In the painting, Luo Yuhang was swinging his majestic attack at the frail-looking youth.

“Something’s wrong!” Luo Yuhang’s face suddenly changed when he felt a great danger descending onto him. When he turned around, he saw a radiating moon descending down on him.

When the moon descended down, the painting was shattered, and Luo Yuhang lost his life. Luo Yuhang was sent flying out with all his ribs broken.

Three years was too long for Lin Yun. He only wanted to fight for the present, to fight for the championship. Sheathing the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun stood proudly on the stage.
