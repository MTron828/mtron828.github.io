Chapter 2172: Put All Karma Onto Me!

There were many saint elixirs growing on the Snow Mountain Abode within the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, decorating this place like a celestial realm. After the Blue Dragon Record came to an end, Mu Xueling had been meditating, sealing the Heavenly Dragon’s blood. This might be a droplet of the Heavenly Dragon’s blood, but the value was higher than a hundred divine bloods added together.

Divine blood was also precious, but every holy land had some stock of divine blood. But the Heavenly Dragon’s blood was different because the value was unimaginable.

It didn’t take long for the Heavenly Dragon’s blood to be sealed within a golden crystal bottle, making Mu Xueling heave a sigh of relief. Next, she would have to find an opportunity to give it to Lin Yun. But the opportunity wasn’t easy to find since there were many people with their attention on the Heavenly Dragon’s blood. The Blood Moon Sect might not dare to offend the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain, but they would definitely go after Lin Yun if she gave it to him.

So she couldn’t allow the Heavenly Dragon’s blood to go to waste. Right then, lute music resounded, echoing throughout the valley.

“Mhm?” Mu Xueling’s face changed as she turned around and saw a white-clothed youth walking over. This person had golden curly hair with unimaginably beautiful features. This person was Tian Xuanzi.

Seeing Tian Xuanzi, Mu Xueling squinted and immediately became alert.

“The world is filled with woes, and it’s a pity that no one can walk with me. We’re both filled with woes.” Tian Xuanzi sang as he played the lute, wearing a smile on his face. There was a white cat with a crimson mark on its forehead following behind Tian Xuanzi.

The white cat that looked noble had a pair of crimson eyes that looked eye-catching. Mu Xueling noticed that it was the Ancient Nine-Tailed Fox, possessing an ancient bloodline and incredible strength.

“This place is really beautiful, but you must be lonely here. After all, ordinary people can’t stay here for long.” Tian Xuanzi smiled as he came over. He sat before Mu Xueling, acting like an old friend as he casually placed the lute to the side and poured a cup of tea for himself.

“Your skills in playing the lute aren’t bad,” Mu Xueling changed the topic while looking at the lute.

Tian Xuanzi raised the teacup, and smiled, “I once practiced it for a little, and I picked it back up after sparring with the Saint Elder back then. Why don’t we have some fun?”

The purple flames on his right shoulder, which were illuminating his face, became dim, alternating between an angel and a demon. But regardless if it was a demon or an angel, it was an incredibly beautiful face.

“Go on.” Mu Xueling didn’t hesitate to summon an ancient zither before her with a wave of her hand.

Tian Xuanzi smiled, before grabbing the lute. At the same time, a lute and a zither music echoed. They had both activated the saint tune to start off. When the two soundwaves clashed together, everything around them was destroyed with the snow being swept away.

In just one second, the ground became clean without a speck of dust with only the zither and lute music being played. Various phenomena soon appeared in the surrounding area. The zither music was a white-clothed swordsman, while the lute music was an army.

Very quickly, Mu Xueling discovered that she couldn’t suppress Tian Xuanzi, no matter how she tried. No matter how much the white-clothed swordsman unleashed his sword aura, it couldn’t break apart the army, so she changed to the Great Saint Tune, to which Tian Xuanzi calmly followed suit.

As the surrounding phenomena became even more intense, the valley became covered with various phenomena.

As the zither music became more majestic, Mu Xueling switched to the Saint King Tune, to which Tian Xuanzi briefly hesitated before following behind her. Those who could play the Saint King Tune could face experts at the Heavenly Origin Phase, and the Imperial Tune was above that, representing the Saint Realm.

Mu Xueling suddenly held down her zither as the music came to an end. Only the lute music remained, sounding like beads rapidly falling onto a jade plate or an arm galloping across the battlefield, and each horse had a black flag fluttering in the wind.

While Tian Xuanzi was surprised, Mu Xueling played the zither again and a dazzling radiance lit up the entire valley. When a golden soundwave swept past, the entire army was swept through and the strings on the lute snapped. They both stopped at the same time as the cold wind blew once more.

Tian Xuanzi said, “Imperial Tune, it’s a pity that my lute is damaged. Saint Elder, you have to compensate me for it.”

When he raised his head, he wore a bright smile. But Mu Xueling’s face was cold as she said, “I have already given you enough face. Don’t take it too far.”

Tian Xuanzi smiled, “But my lute is damaged. Shouldn’t you give me an explanation for damaging my lute?”

“Don’t beat around the bush. What do you want?” Mu Xueling looked at Tian Xuanzi coldly.

“That droplet of Heavenly Dragon’s blood seems pretty good,” Tian Xuanzi said.

The Ancient Nine-Tailed Fox came to a stone mountain nearby, looking at Mu Xueling coldly.

Mu Xueling looked at Tian Xuanzi, and she said, “No one can offend the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain without paying the price, no one. Not even that Empress.”

“You’re threatening me?” Tian Xuanzi sighed.

“I don’t wish to repeat myself,” Mu Xueling said.

Tian Xuanzi said with a self-mocking tone, “Those from the Ancient Barren Domain know that I will do anything to achieve my goal. I’m a bad person, and when a bad person comes to you wanting something, you better not take any chances.”

As he slowly stood up, he looked at the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, and said, “The scenery here is beautiful, and I believe many people’s hearts will be broken if this place is destroyed.”

“No one will feel heartache in everyone's head.” The cat licked its paw and said coldly.

“Smart,” Tian Xaunzi smiled. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Mu Xueling took a deep breath to calm her anger. She knew that she wasn’t Tian Xuanzi’s opponent if they fought. The current Tian Xuanzi was stronger than a year ago, and he was even more unfathomable. A year ago, Tian Xuanzi was injured, and Mu Xueling wasn’t able to block him, not to mention now that Tian Xuanzi had recovered and was even stronger.

Tian Xuanzi wouldn’t be able to stop her if she wanted to leave, but she didn’t hesitate to believe that he would slaughter everyone from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion if that was the case. A long time later, after Mu Xueling calmed her emotions, she took out the golden crystal bottle containing the Heavenly Dragon’s blood.

“Thank you, Saint Elder,” Tian Xuanzi smiled and reached out.

But Mu Xueling stopped him, and said, “You’re bad, but you’re not stupid. Even those from the Blood Moon Sect didn’t dare to offend the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. Are you sure that you want to offend the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain and take this Heavenly Dragon’s blood away?”

“Back then, even the Nine Emperors couldn't do anything to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain even when they joined forces together, so why will I dare? But I have to take this Heavenly Dragon’s blood no matter what, and if there’s any karma, just put it all on me!” Tian Xuanzi said as he took the crystal bottle away. He gave her a smile before he lowered his head to look at the zither.

“Your zither isn’t bad. Actually, I also know the Imperial Tune.” Tian Xuanzi gently strummed the zither and a golden radiance soared to the sky with a boundless imperial pressure blooming from Tian Xuanzi that instantly enveloped the entire valley.

“Let’s meet again in the future.” Tian Xuanzi carried the white cat, and left while waving his hand.

Mu Xueling looked at Tian Xuanzi’s figure while clenching her fists together.

Zhuge Qingyun and Qin Cang were waiting outside the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. When Tian Xuanzi came out with the cat in his embrace, he handed the cat to Zhuge Qingyun, and said, “Help Lil’ Nine to scratch. Otherwise, I won't sleep well.”

“Alright.” Zhuge Qingyun smiled. This wasn’t his first time scratching the cat for him.

Tian Xuanzi handed the crystal bottle to Qin Cang, and said, “Go to the Divine Dragon Empire and hand this to someone.”

Qin Cang was baffled as he looked at the crystal bottle. He took it, and couldn’t help asking, “Master, who am I going to give it to?”

“Give it to whoever asks you for it,” Tian Xuanzi said.

“Oh, okay.” Qin Cang casually placed the crystal bottle in his clothes, but he wasn’t in a hurry to leave.

“That’s the Heavenly Dragon’s blood. Don’t carry it this way. Put it in your interspatial bracelet,” Tian Xuanzi smiled.

Qin Cang’s face changed, before he staggered after hearing what Tian Xuanzi said.

“Relax. No one will think that the Heavenly Dragon’s blood will be in your hands. Go now,” Tian Xuanzi comforted.

“Ah? Didn’t we say that I’ll follow Master to weigh the entire Eastern Desolation?” Qin Cang asked.

“This trip is dangerous for me, and there’s no need for you to follow me. As long as the Radiant Sword Saint isn’t back, don’t come back,” Tian Xuanzi said.

“Master is a peerless genius, and I believe that you will survive. No one in the Kunlun Realm has a talent comparable to Master in the past thousand years,” Qin Cang replied.

“Every gift given by fate has a price tag on it, and I’m not an exception. Leave now,” Tian Xuanzi sighed with a gentle smile.

Qin Cang still wanted to say something, but he knew that his master wouldn’t change his mind after making a decision.

“Senior Brother, take care of Master,” Qin Cang turned to look at Zhuge Qingyun.

After Qin Cang left, Tian Xuanzi looked at his eldest disciple, and said, “Zhuge Qingyun, there’s no path of return once we make this trip.”

“I won’t turn back,” Zhuge Qingyun replied.

“Alright. Let’s not turn back, then!” Tian Xuanzi smiled.

The corner of Zhuge Qingyun’s lips twitched, before he said, “Master, that direction is back to the Ancient Barren Domain…”

“Is that so?” Tian Xuanzi smiled awkwardly, then he said, “Which direction is the Myriad Thunder Peak? Forget it, you lead the way…”
