Chapter 185 - No Chance of Survival

Since the alpha wolf had died, the wolf pack immediately fled, solving the trouble that Li Xiaotian’s group had been in. Lin Yun raised his head and saw the wound on Li Wuyou’s chest as he sat on the Dragon Blooded Horse. The injury from the alpha wolf’s claw was shocking. Lin Yun had fought with the alpha wolf and still felt numbness throughout his arm. He could understand how dangerous that claw was.

“Why are you trying to show off with those injuries? Get down!” commanded Lin Yun.

“Hehe.” Li Wuyou chuckled. He felt cool when he had grabbed the alpha wolf’s decapitated head.

But he still listened to Lin Yun’s words and smiled, “It’s all thanks to Lil’ Red. Otherwise, I would be dead by now.”

The two had planned for a long time and they even factored in all possible accidents. But no matter how meticulous a plan was, there was never a perfect plan. They just didn’t expect the alpha wolf’s neck to be so tough.

The Dragon Blooded Horse gave Lin Yun the beast core it held in its mouth. The beast core was brimming with an ominous aura, containing terrifying power. The Dragon Blooded Horse knew that this beast core wasn’t simple. Although the Dragon Blooded Horse would usually fight for food, it was composed at a crucial time.

“We underestimated the alpha wolf.” Lin Yun took the beast core and toyed with it in his hand. Or perhaps they had underestimated the entire wolf pack. If Li Wuyou hadn’t come in time with the alpha wolf’s decapitated head, the wolf pack would definitely go after them.

“You can have it. You nearly lost your life.” Lin Yun smiled as he tossed the precious beast core to Li Wuyou.

“What can I do with this thing? You need it right now since your cultivation is soaring.” Li Wuyou refused without any hesitation.

Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!

Footsteps sounded out as they saw Li Xiaotian coming over with his group, looking shameful. Li Xiaotian was in a dilemma and wanted to leave. But no matter what, he still had to thank Lin Yun and Li Wuyou since they saved him. You wouldn’t know how terrifying the wolf pack was unless you were besieged by them. Lin Yun and Li Wuyou easily dealt with the alpha wolf, but Li Xiaotian knew how dangerous the fight was.

That was precisely the reason why he felt ashamed. Biting the bullet, he spoke out, “Thank you for your help.”

“Haha, you’re making us sound like strangers. We’re both candidates under Senior Sister Xin Yan, so it’s not an exaggeration for us to address each other as senior brother and junior brother,” Li Wuyou mocked. He didn’t have a good impression of Li Xiaotian when he saw the latter coming over.

Li Xiaotian smiled bitterly, knowing that he was in the wrong, “Senior Brother Lin, Senior Brother Li…”

“Who are you trying to call Senior Brother?” Li Wuyou held grudges and immediately interrupted when Li Xiaotian spoke, nearly causing Li Xiaotian to spew out blood. Since Li Wuyou had the opportunity, he naturally had to take revenge.

Li Xiaotian looked awkward and those behind him didn’t know what to say either. He could do nothing about it since he was the first one to look down on Lin Yun and Li Wuyou. He had offended them both. So there was no way Li Wuyou would be polite to him.

“Brother Li, don’t worry about it. He just has a bad temper. So, how did you guys get surrounded by the wolf pack?” Lin Yun spoke out to ease the atmosphere.

Breathing a sigh of relief, Li Xiaotian said, “I’m at fault for being greedy and falling for their trap. I won’t get into the story, but I’m really sorry for what I did… Senior Sister Xin Yan did tell me to take care of you two before coming in the Firmament Realm, but…”

Lin Yun naturally knew what he wanted to say. Li Xiaotian probably wanted to say that they had offended the two Wang brothers and that he didn’t want to be implicated by getting too close to them. Then again, there was nothing Lin Yun could say about it since it was human nature. Lin Yun had his own scale in his heart that he would treat others based on how they treated him.

He could save them once for Xin Yan’s sake, but he wouldn’t do that again. Li Wuyou was his brother who dared to stand on his side while facing the Wang brothers’ pressure. In the future, he would help Li Wuyou with no hesitation as long as he was needed. That was the difference between Li Wuyou and Li Xiaotian.

“It’s okay. I understand.” Lin Yun smiled to interrupt Li Xiaotian from going any further. His magnanimity not only made Li Xiaotian feel relaxed, but it also made the latter feel the distance between them.

“The two of you have to be careful. I’ve seen Wang Yan’s men recently. They have been going around contacting Profound Martial Realm geniuses in the Firmament Realm. But I have no idea what they’re trying to do.” Li Xiaotian cupped his hands together and bid his farewell.

After the group left, Li Wuyou spoke out, “They’re just a bunch of snobs. Why are you so polite to them?”

Lin Yun didn’t respond to Li Wuyou. He looked at the beast core in his hand and replied, “With this beast core, I might be able to unlock my heart orifice.”

Using the eight white pellets for the past two weeks caused Lin Yun’s cultivation to soar. It did so even after reaching the sixth orifice of the Xiantian Realm. This made him certain that he had Seventh Grade Spiritual Physique for his aptitude. Among the candidates, he could be ranked among the top because of the Seventh Grade Spiritual Physique. There wasn’t anyone who could surpass him.

Li Wuyou smiled, “The forest might be dangerous, but it’s suitable for the Xiantian Realm cultivation. I’m sure that this is also part of the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s plan.”

Lin Yun pondered and found that it made sense. After all, they wouldn’t be able to find such an excellent beast core elsewhere. Of course, the prerequisite was that you had to have the strength to hunt them. Otherwise, you would only be facing death.

Keeping the beast core, Lin Yun smiled, “Let’s find something to eat and rest.”

When they looked around, they could only see the Armoured Fiendwolves’ corpses. Li Wuyou’s gaze ultimately fell on the alpha wolf’s decapitated corpse. Licking his lips, he smiled, “Why don’t we have the alpha wolf tonight? This beast must be powerful, so I’m sure it’s delicious.”

The Dragon Blooded Horse’s ears twitched when it listened to Li Wuyou’s words. It ran over and picked the alpha wolf’s corpse up.

“Haha! Lil’ Red knows me well!” Li Wuyou laughed and patted the Dragon Blooded Horse before looking at Lin Yun eagerly. He had experienced Lin Yun’s grilling skills for the past few days. Thanks to that, he had now become picky with his food.

“Alright, but this alpha wolf is more troublesome to deal with.” Receiving Lin Yun’s approval, Li Wuyou and the Dragon Blooded Horse rejoiced. Looking at them, Lin Yun could only shake his head with a wry smile.

In a hidden place located in the forest where the trees were towering and the surrounding was filled with Blackflame Crows whose red pupils made the dark forest look creepy. Amid all of this, there was a bewitching flute that echoed out into the surrounding.

“Congratulations, Brother Mo. You’ve finally recovered from your injuries.” Wang Ning and Leng Mo stepped under the tree as they looked at Mo Qingyun, who was blowing the flute, with a smile. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Putting down his bone flute, Mo Qingyun replied, “What is there to be happy about? My Martial Soul nearly got destroyed.”

“Don’t worry about it. I’m sure that you can take your revenge very quickly.” Wang Ning smiled.

“Is this Lin Yun really that difficult to kill? He’s just someone in the fifth orifice who grasped an incomplete sword intent. There’s no way he can compete with a Profound Martial Realm cultivator.” Three additional figures appeared by Wang Ning, Leng Mo, and Mo Qingyun. The one who spoke was Feng Haoyu, a Profound Martial Realm genius. His cultivation was equivalent to Leng Mo, who had reached the first pulse of the Profound Martial Realm. The other two were two cousins, Han Mo and Han Feng, from the Heavenly Qin County’s Han Clan. Although the Han Clan wasn’t comparable to the four major families, it was still an aristocratic clan.

The three of them were helpers that Wang Ning found. Turning around to look at Feng Haoyu, Wang Ning replied, “After two weeks, that fellow must be in the sixth orifice of the Xiantian Realm by now. But that’s just a minor detail. What’s really tough about him is his physique and he also knows a ferocious fist technique. If I’ve recognized it correctly, it should be the Dragon-Tiger Fist.”

The Dragon-Tiger Fist? The faces of Feng Haoyu and the other two changed when they heard that. The Dragon-Tiger Fist was well known in the Great Qin Empire for being invincible. Although some incomplete copies were scattered around the empire, there weren’t many people who could truly learn them through the incomplete copies.

“That fellow also has a companion. There’s nothing great about him, but his Martial Soul is weird. It’s also troublesome to deal with him,” Leng Mo added.

“Hoho! But he’s doomed to die after offending you.” A heaty burst of laughter rang out from the woods, which made even the Blackflame Crows instinctively fearful as they started crying out. A figure slowly walked out from the darkness, holding onto his sword. He wore azure clothes with long sleeves.

“Huangfu Jingxuan!” Everyone’s faces changed when they saw him. Huangfu Jingxuan had long been famous in the Heavenly Qin County and everyone here knew about him. He was someone ranked in the top three among all the candidates in this examination.

“I want him dead, but the odds aren’t certain. But I believe that he will definitely die if Brother Huangfu helps out.” Wang Ning smiled.

“It’s not a loss to take ten Greater Profound Pills from you just to kill a brat in the fifth orifice of the Xiantian Realm. But I heard that he has a very close relationship with Senior Sister Xin Yan. Are you sure that your brother can withstand her pressure if she pursues the matter?” Huangfu Jingxuan asked indifferently.

Everyone turned to look at Wang Ning. Wang Yan would definitely protect his younger brother, so there was nothing to worry about even if Wang Ning got into deep trouble. But none of them had a strong relationship with Wang Yan. Xin Yan was known for being the prettiest disciple in the Sword Firmament Pavilion and what made her famous was her other title, Blood Rose. She was a thorny rose and anyone who laid their hands on her would get pricked.

She would naturally attract attention very often with her beauty, but anyone who had ideas about her would die a terrible death. The strongest disciple in the Sword Firmament Pavilion wasn’t certain, but she definitely had the most kills under her name. However, she didn’t merely have strength. She also had strong charisma within the sect.

“Don’t worry about it. Lin Yun only has garbage for his Martial Soul. I’m sure about that since he didn’t dare to summon it. I don’t believe that Xin Yan is willing to offend so many of us for someone like him.” Wang Ning laughed. “And this is also the best time for us to kill him in the Firmament Realm. After all, no one guaranteed that there would be no deaths in the examination.”

“Are you sure he has garbage for his Martial Soul?” Huangfu Jingxuan asked, locking his brows together.

“Back in the Azure Sun Realm, he didn’t summon his Martial Soul despite being surrounded by hundreds of people. Two weeks ago, he would rather abandon his identity as a seeded candidate than summon his Martial Soul. Even when he was facing us previously, he didn’t summon his Martial Soul!” Wang Ning smiled.

“I can testify to that,” said Mo Qingyun.

“The same goes for me.” Leng Mo nodded.

The few of them exchanged a look and no longer hesitated. Since Lin Yun’s Martial Soul was trash, it wouldn’t matter whether or not they killed him. Even if Xin Yan wanted to poke her nose into this matter, the sect would definitely protect them. Compared to the death of someone whose Martial Soul was trash, they were more valuable to the sect.

“Then we’ll follow your arrangements. When are we going to make a move?” Huangfu Jingxuan asked.

“Relax. We’ll wait for everyone to gather. Since Brother Mo has already recovered, we can go after that sword slave anytime.”

When Han Mo and Han Feng heard that, they were both shocked. They had seven Profound Martial Realm members here and any single one of them could kill Lin Yun. Having all seven of them was assurance enough, but Wang Ning actually wanted to invite more people? Was he trying to gather all the Profound Martial Realm candidates?

The Wang Clan was truly powerful. From the looks of it, Wang Ning didn’t want to give Lin Yun any chance of survival.
