Chapter 2135: You’re My Woman!

Ye Ziling curiously looked at Lin Yun. She couldn’t imagine him becoming so strong in just a year. Many people said Lin Yun died after the Ancient Barren Battlefield ended, and he wouldn’t dare to show himself even if he wasn’t dead. But no one would have guessed that Flower Burial was still Flower Burial. Everyone knew and he came to the Blue Dragon Record under so many eyes.

But Ye Ziling was curious as to why Lin Yun wasn’t interested in the Dragon’s Head of the True Dragon and gave it to Cao Yang. She asked, “You don’t want the True Dragon’s spot?”

“No.” Lin Yun shook his head.

“Why are you here, then?” Ye Ziling asked curiously.

Lin Yun turned to look at Ye Ziling, and he said, “I’m here for you.”

Ye Ziling trembled when she heard that and didn’t know how to reply to Lin Yun. Didn’t he know how lethal his words were?

“What’s the matter? Are you touched? But don’t fall for me because I have someone I like,” Lin Yun laughed.

Ye Ziling had no changes in her expression, but she couldn’t help feeling guilty. She coldly said, “I like Flower Burial, not Lin Yun. Don’t be narcissistic.”

He words and face were as cold as ice.

Lin Yun smiled as a response. He didn’t want to lie to Ye Ziling. He truly was here for her, worried about her situation. It was fine if he didn’t see her, but it wasn’t his style to disregard her after seeing her. As for the Dragon’s Head of the True Dragon, he never even thought about it, including becoming the champion of the Blue Dragon Record.

This was because Lin Yun felt complicated. He was naturally concerned with the reward, but he heard that Mu Xueling received the reward from the Empress. Mu Xueling’s other identity was the Divine Dragon Envoy, and the Blue Dragon Record garnered geniuses from all over the Kunlun Realm. This was a rare opportunity, and was also the opportunity for the Empress to recruit geniuses.

The Empress was probably the person behind Tian Xuanzi, so Lin Yun didn’t have a good impression of her. Others naturally didn’t have to care about it and did their best to fight for the top position.

Lin Yun was relatively calm as he recollected himself and walked towards the Dragon’s Head with Ye Ziling. The Dragon’s Head was massive, and Cao Yang was baffled after being tossed there. He still couldn’t figure out how someone who was so heavily injured like him became the champion of the True Dragon Path.

After all, he came here with confidence only to be humiliated. But just when he wanted to give up, he suddenly became the champion of the True Dragon Path. Cao Yang was initially reserved, but he held onto his chin and smiled, “This feels pretty good!”

When he saw Lin Yun and Ye Ziling approaching, the smile disappeared from his face, and he seriously said, “Ye Qingtian, I can’t take this spot. You are more suitable than me.”

“No need to be humble. I will pick another Dragon Mountain. Aside from me, you’re the best candidate for the True Dragon Path’s champion,” Lin Yun smiled.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Cao Yang felt happy and smiled, “Since you’ve already said that, I won’t be humble then and take this spot.”

After all, Mo Li, Fang Haotian, and Xiao Hongfei were defeated, so he wasn’t afraid that anyone could compete with him for this spot.

“I’m not letting you sit here for nothing. Help me take care of Lady Ye on the Dragon’s Claw,” Lin Yun said his true purpose.

Based on Ye Ziling’s strength, it was hard for her to sit firmly on the Dragon’s Head position without his protection, and she might become a target of everyone the moment he left. Even Cao Yang might not be able to sit firmly on the Dragon’s Head, but with Cao Yang attracting the attention and his guarantee, it should be more than sufficient for Ye Ziling to have a spot on the Dragon’s Claw.

According to Ye Ziling’s initial thoughts, she was satisfied if she could have a spot on the Dragon’s Tail.

“Don’t worry about it. With me around, no one can touch Lady Ye,” Cao Yang guaranteed, patting himself on his chest.

“Alright. Treat your injuries first,” Lin Yun smiled and wasn’t in a hurry to leave. Cao Yang was still injured, and it would be dangerous if he left now. Secondly, he also needed a brief rest after undergoing a battle. Like that, the three sat on the Dragon’s Head, resting as they became enveloped in saint aura.

Outside the Dragon Mountains, everyone was still shocked and hadn’t come to their senses yet.

“Ye Qingtian has also reached the Quasi-Saint Realm. He’s only at the Azure Origin Phase, but the quality of his saint aura is greater than the likes of Fang Haotian!”

“Didn’t he fail to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage? He must’ve succeeded.”

“Didn’t you guys notice that Ye Qingtian’s sword intent can bear the impact of saint dao and not dissipate? This is too unbelievable.”

“Ye Qingtian will have a firm spot as the True Dragon’s champion.”

“Yeah. Look at how intense the fight is on the Divine Dragon Path!”

“This is the furthest he can go. If he’s really capable, he would’ve gone to the Divine Dragon Path!” Someone exclaimed, and someone wasn’t convinced.

At the foot of the mountain, those from the Sword Sect were happy and didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to be so powerful. This way, Ye Ziling could now have a firm spot on the Dragon’s Claw. Naturally, this excited the Sword Sect’s disciples, who only wanted a spot on the Dragon’s Tail. They were satisfied because the Sword Sect wasn’t even a holy land, and it was a great surprise that they could have a spot on the Dragon’s Claw.

“Ye Qingtian, a genius of the Heavenly Dao Sect, competes for a spot on the True Dragon Path. He’s really the shame of holy lands.”

“Flower Burial is a true genius. How can Ye Qingtian be considered a prodigy swordsman?” Those from the Ye Clan were jealous when they saw this scene, especially Ye Xuan.

Ye Xin’er pouted and muttered, “Golden-generation geniuses should at least go for the Azure Dragon Path, and yet Ye Qingtian is only taking advantage of the fact that there aren’t any experts here.”

They didn’t know that Lin Yun was planning to leave the True Dragon Path, and they thought Ye Qingtian wasn’t going to leave when they saw him resting on the Dragon’s Head. They were just a bunch of weaklings becoming jealous of Ye Qingtian.

The faces of those from the Heavenly Dao Sect and Sword Sect were ugly, but they didn’t know how to refute those words.

“Indeed, he took advantage of the fact that no experts existed on the True Dragon Path. The True Dragon Path is insignificant in the eyes of everyone, so it’s shameful, even if he became the champion.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Ye Qingtian would most likely pick again. After all, the Eastern Desolation’s sects are all on the Azure Dragon Path, so he would probably go there.”

“Only a fool would go. Even if the True Dragon Path’s champion is insignificant, one still qualifies for the final competition.”

“Yeah. If he went to the Azure Dragon Path, he might not even be able to obtain a spot on the Dragon’s Claw. Ye Qingtian has seen it through.” The discussions regarding Lin Yun reached a new height. Ye Qingtian was very famous. Although he wasn’t as dazzling as the champions of the heavenly paths, everyone knew about his nickname as the Holy Maiden Killer. So, the discussions regarding him increased after seeing him obtain the champion.

“Someone like him has the cheek to claim to be a swordsman? Look at how bloody the Divine Dragon Path is. Even a Quasi-Saint grasping a greater dao might not be able to obtain a spot, and he’s a swordsman. Why doesn’t he possess the guts of one?” Many people were jealous, seeing that Ye Qingtian was going to become the champion of the Dragon Path.

“Damn it, these people are too much! They previously said that Senior Brother Ye would fail. Now that Senior Brother Ye became a champion, they immediately changed their words.”

“I want to tear their mouths apart.” Disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect were furious when they heard the surrounding discussions. They were furious, but there was nothing they could say about it. They knew those people were just jealous, and one would be a fool to go onto the Divine Dragon Path like they said. No matter what, the champion of the True Dragon Path was still a champion.

The competition on the Divine Dragon Path was bloody, and even a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase might be unable to gain a footing there. Not to mention, everyone wasn’t just competing for a spot and a ranking. For example, multiple people could stand on the Dragon’s Torso, but there was a ranking between them.

Everyone was young, and they were geniuses of the various forces. So, they naturally wouldn’t be willing to admit that they were weaker than someone else. There were a few hundred spots on the Dragon’s Torso on the Indigo Dragon Path, and the competition between the various holy land geniuses was intense.

A beauty barely held her own against seven to eight people for a spot. Compared to others, she naturally suffered unfair treatment. As a genius of the demonic cult, she was naturally targeted by the various holy lands. This woman was An Liuyan.

The ones attacking her were from the Aquamoon Sword Mountain, Heavenly Saint Gate, and Four Divisional Gate, led by Zhao Wusheng, Xiao Zhenya, and Yuan Hengying. They were strong and on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking. They have also grasped saint dao and were elites among geniuses.

“An Liuyan, stop struggling. Someone like you from the demonic cult wants to compete with us? Get lost to the Dragon’s Tail!” Zhao Wusheng sneered. He was arrogant, and didn’t bother concealing his enmity.

“I heard that Lady An’s charming skills are rare. Why don’t you execute them and let us experience them?” Xiao Zhenya smiled with unconcealable desire flashing across his eyes.

“Hahaha!” Everyone laughed along with Xiao Zhenya. The righteous sects were naturally hostile to those from the demonic cult, especially women. Not only were they filled with hostility, but also lecherous thoughts.

“Lady An’s figure is pretty good. If you’re willing to serve me for a night, I can make the decision and let you have this spot,” Yuan Hengying smiled as he held onto his chin.

“That goes the same for me.”

“I don’t mind, either.” The three were humiliating her, with their waves of laughter roaring. Some cultivators felt they were too much but shook their heads after seeing that An Liuyan was from the demonic cult. After all, it was easy to cause rumors if they interacted too closely with a woman from the demonic cult.

An Liuyan finally couldn’t hold on and threw out a mouthful of blood before being chased from her spot. Her face was pale, and her eyes were filled with reluctance. She also wanted to fight for the Blue Dragon Record.

She wanted to grasp her fate and didn’t want to go with the flow.

“Hehe, let’s drive her to the Dragon’s Tail. Consider this a lesson for her!” Everyone quickly rushed over.

Right then, a dazzling sword ray broke through the barrier of the Indigo Dragon Path, and a genius from another Dragon Mountain broke through the barrier and came to the Indigo Dragon Path.

“Who is it?” Everyone was shocked and curious about who had crossed the barrier. The newcomer was enveloped in saint radiance while grabbing An Liuyan’s wrist, pulling her to his back.

“Let go of me!” An Liuyan began to struggle with a rage of flames blazing within her eyes.

“You’re my woman, so why should I let you go?” As the light dissipated, Lin Yun looked at An Liuyan and transmitted his voice to her.

As they looked at each other, An Liuyan was briefly stunned. Although this person looked unfamiliar, his words had already stated his identity.
