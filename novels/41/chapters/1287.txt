Chapter 1288 - Azure Dragon! (2)

“Kill him!” Bai Luli’s face was ugly when he saw this scene. This was a huge fortune, and it was actually secretive. Now, even if he had no idea if this would attract the geniuses from the eight strongest sects, he knew that Lin Yun wanted to take all this fortune for himself after causing such a huge uproar. So there was no way Bai Luli could let him get away with it.

He was so furious that he even threw out a mouthful of blood with his face turning pale. But he was also the first person to attack.

“Nine Heavenly Dragon Roar!” Bai Luli opened his mouth and unleashed a ferocious roar that sounded like the roar of a dragon. At the same time, his constellation, an erupting volcano, also unfolded behind him. Paired with the dragon roar from his mouth, it instantly enveloped Lin Yun.

This was a secret technique, and the entire region that Lin Yun was in began to burn with a charred smell spreading out. But Lin Yun ultimately blocked his attack by circulating the Azure Dragon Saint Art. When a thousand purple-golden dragon runes bloomed on his body, he simply used his physique to take this terrifying secret art head-on.

After breaking free from the golden sea of flames, Lin Yun began to emit a purple-golden glow with a pair of wings flapping on his back, dodging the attacks coming from Bai Luli. Right at this moment, the Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples also brought out their constellations, unleashing all sorts of secret techniques toward Lin Yun. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Come at me!” The golden wings flapped on Lin Yun’s back and he suddenly disappeared from where he initially stood. After he summoned the pair of Golden Crow’s wings, his speed reached an unbelievable height.

The attacks from the Elysium Core Realm experts were terrifying, but it was useless if those attacks couldn’t touch him. At this moment, Lin Yun had unleashed the unrivaled grace of the Divine Sunchasing Art.

When he reappeared, the dragon runes gathered into his palm with thunderstorms manifesting on a dragon claw that reached out to the Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples. This attack was terrifying, but his attack merely ripped off a layer of starlight on their bodies. But as those Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples circulated their elysium cores, the scattered light swiftly gathered together.

“Heh. I still thought that you were strong. So it turns out that you’re just an ant at the Galaxy Stage!” That Flame Dragon Sect’s disciple initially panicked when he saw Lin Yun charging over. But when he discovered that he merely suffered some light injuries, he instantly relaxed.

Wearing a sinister expression, he sneered, “Looks like you’re really unfortunate. If you’d reached the Elysium Core Realm, even I couldn’t take a single attack from you. But now, you can go and die peacefully!”

He was arrogant, but when a light shone out from his elysium core, astral energy manifested into an armor on the surface of his body. After all, he was an Elysium Core Realm of a big sect, and he was naturally stronger than the other Elysium Core Realm experts that Lin Yun had encountered so far.

“You can go and die now!” The Flame Dragon Sect’s disciple laughed, feeling that he would soon receive a huge merit. As starlight surged behind him, he became further empowered by his constellation, manifesting into a terrifying pressure that came crashing down.

“Disperse! Don’t fight him head-on!” Bai Luli anxiously yelled when he saw this scene from afar.

“Haha! Relax, Senior Brother. I can hold him down!” The disciple began to laugh with brimming confidence, feeling that he could suppress Lin Yun all by himself. After all, the difference between their cultivations was too great, and even if Lin Yun had a powerful physique, he was confident that he wouldn’t be injured within ten moves.

But the moment he thought so, Lin Yun’s attack landed on his right shoulder with an explosive power pouring out. His dragon runes were like sharp blades wreaking havoc on that disciple.

“Found it!” Lin Yun had his sword intent circulating in his pupils at this moment, and this allowed him to find the weakness in his opponent with a glance. As a draconic roar echoed from within his body, a boundless thunderstorm exploded. When two hundred dragon runes gathered on his palm, dragon scales began to grow on his hand and his nails also became terrifyingly sharp.

When Lin Yun tightened his grip, blood splashed out from the Flame Dragon Sect’s disciple. Losing the protection of his astral energy, his physique was like an old rag that was easily torn apart by Lin Yun.

“You’re courting death!” Bai Luli flew into a rage when he saw this scene.

But Lin Yun merely smiled. When the pair of wings unfolded on his back, he immediately disappeared from the spot. When he reappeared once more, he was already a few thousand meters away and reached another Flame Dragon Sect’s disciple, finding a flaw with one strike and killing with another.

Lin Yun no longer aimed for instakills because these Elysium Core Realm disciples weren’t simple. He just needed to find the flaw in his opponent before killing them with his Azure Dragon Saint Art.

Just like that, Lin Yun was like a golden specter flashing around on the battlefield whenever his wings flapped. Through this process, his Azure Dragon Saint Physique gradually became stronger as he slowly got more used to his new physique.

As blood splashed around on the battlefield, eight Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples had lost their lives in just a few breaths’ time.

“Bastard! I dare you to fight me head-on! I’ll crush your head like a watermelon!” Bai Luli’s face was distorted while he cursed out.

Anyone could tell that Lin Yun had learned some sort of technique by aiming for the Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples and not fighting Bai Luli. He was using the Elysium Core Realm disciples of their Flame Dragon Sect as training partners. Because in just ten-odd moves, his strength had undergone a huge transformation.

The Flame Dragon Sect was a big sect, and they had never been played around with like that before. But Bai Luli knew that if he allowed Lin Yun to carry on, he would lose all the Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples. So the fury made Bai Luli’s eyes gush with flames.

“Do you dare to fight me?!” Bai Luli roared once more, and his loud roar even made countless hills crumble a few hundred miles away.

“As you wish!” Lin Yun stopped with the golden wings unfolding behind him, enveloping him in a golden light that made him look like a deity. He had more or less grasped the power of the Innate Azure Dragon Saint Physique with the lives of those Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples.

“Good!” Bai Luli smiled sinisterly before he continued, “Then let me see how you’ll die!”

When his constellation opened up behind him, a golden volcano rose into the sky with a jiao-dragon coiled around it.

“Senior Brother, kill him!” The remaining Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples furiously roared. They were confident that Bai Luli was invincible because he was a transcendent genius who had proven his strength. He had forged his name in the Empyrean Realm, and now that he had reached the Elysium Core Realm, this only meant that he had gotten even stronger.

They believed that Bai Luli could restrain Lin Yun just by using his constellation alone. After all, Lin Yun was only at the Galaxy Stage, no matter how anyone looked at it.

“What a powerful constellation. How envious.” Lin Yun’s eyes blazed with flames when he raised his head to look at Bai Luli’s constellation.

“Since you know the power of our senior brother’s constellation, then why aren’t you begging for mercy?!” A Flame Dragon Sect’s disciple smiled when he saw this scene and even took several steps forth.

“Who the hell do you think you are? You think that you have the right to speak here?” Lin Yun smirked.

As thunderstorms began to converge, an azure dragon’s roar echoed when Lin Yun pushed his palm out. At the same time, the wings behind him also flapped and he appeared before the disciple who provoked him earlier.

When a thousand runes exploded, a dragon claw swiped across the sky and he was turned into a lump of crimson mist. This instantly left the audience members dumbfounded with their jaws dropping because Lin Yun was too overbearing. Is he planning to mow down the Flame Dragon Sect head-on?

“You bastard!” Bai Luli’s eyes turned red with his killing aura increasing even more after Lin Yun killed another person before him. No one had acted with such arrogance in front of him before, and his anger even made his entire body start trembling, “If I don’t kill you today, then I won’t be a transcendent genius!”

The jiao-dragon at the summit of the golden volcano behind him let out a ferocious roar and breathed out golden flames, lighting the sky. At the same time, a terrifying dragon aura also swept out and made the sky turn dark.

“Q-Quick!”

“A huge battle is going to break out!” The surrounding geniuses were all shocked by this scene and began to flee. But there were some who responded late and were turned into ashes.

“You want to kill me? Then you’re destined to be disappointed. Even if I’m only at the Galaxy Stage, I’m not someone you can kill!” Lin Yun smiled and activated the saint rune in the Azure Dragon Mark. No, it should be a divine rune now.

In the blink of an eye, a thousand dragon runes began to gather on Lin Yun’s body, making it appear as if the scales of an azure dragon were on the surface of his body. When the crimson flames blazed, the azure dragon came to life and flew from his body.

At the same time, a terrifying thunderstorm vortex began to form in the sky that instantly destroyed the constellation aura that Bai Luli had unleashed upon Lin Yun. When the azure dragon coiled around Lin Yun, the dragon looked vivid with blood and flesh. When Lin Yun reached out and placed his hand on the azure dragon, he could feel the warmth coming from the azure dragon.

“What the hell is that…”

“Is that a real dragon?” The audience members who fled nearly fell from the sky when they turned their heads back and saw this scene.

“Heavenly Core Disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, Lin Yun, accepts your challenge!” Lin Yun smiled with his hair fluttering in the wind. His eyes were blazing with fighting spirit, and he would tell everyone that even if his enemies were transcendent geniuses, he would still be able to kill them!
