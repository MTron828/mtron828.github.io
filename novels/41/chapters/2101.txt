Chapter 2102: Golden Lotus Flametree

Wang Muyan was furious because she felt that Lin Yun was trying to humiliate her by calling her ‘Big Sister,’ even though she had been using it to address herself. She held onto her chest and glared at Lin Yun before she ran to change her clothes, “I finally realized it now. The famous Flower Burial?isn’t a gentleman at all.”

“Hehe. Lin Yun, even that vixen can tell that you’re a scumbag!” Lil’ Purple clapped her hands together within the Iris Secret Realm.

Lin Yun merely replied with a smile but didn’t say anything about it. He would have been killed on the Heavenly Path countless times if he was a righteous gentleman. He only had to follow his heart as a swordsman and continue his path.

After Wang Muyan changed her clothes, Lin Yun said, “I have an idea. I’ll teach you the Divine Solar Lunar Fist, and you’ll tell me the other secrets of the Divine Solar Lunar Art, then we can comprehend together.”

The Dragon Sun and Moon Seal was very powerful. Lin Yun had just practiced it, and yet his combat prowess was doubled. If he continued to practice the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal, his strength would improve by leaps and bounds. He could sense the unlimited potential within the three variations, especially the third, which perfectly complemented his weakness.

For a long time, his shortcomings and strengths were obvious. He could slay Quasi-Saints with his Astral Sword Intent, but he couldn’t withstand the attack of saint aura. In the past, he could rely on his two saint physiques to withstand it, but saint aura and saint dao would erase his advantage. But the third variation was different because the armor he forged with dual sword stars allowed him to withstand the attacks of Quasi-Saints. In the future, he could withstand the attacks of a Quasi-Saint with the third variation, and he could also rely on his two saint physiques to maintain his vitality while carrying on his fight.

He needed to take a step further with his third variation. Aside from that, the first and second variations were also useful because he could use them to change the tide of the battle at a crucial moment.

Facing Lin Yun’s offer, Wang Muyan briefly pondered before she agreed. She couldn’t refuse Lin Yun’s offer about the Divine Solar Lunar Fist because she owed him a favor. Not only did he void their bet, but he even treated her injuries. Aside from being a little hateful, she could say nothing about Lin Yun’s character.

Like that, they began cultivating within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, sharing their comprehensions, allowing them to make huge progress. They were both geniuses, and they had their opportunities. So when they joined together, the rapport between them was terrifying.

Regardless of whether it was Lin Yun or Wang Muyan, they both admired one another. When they had an idea, the other party could immediately follow up and spar outside the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda to verify their speculation. At times, they would stubbornly hold their grounds.

But, as they interacted, their relationship improved without them realizing it. They would either share their comprehension or fight; their figures could be seen everywhere within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“This is youth, and it’s nice to be young.” The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord was watching everything while stroking his beard with emotions. Ye Qingtian and Wang Muyan were like his long-lost youth.

Aside from practicing the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal, Lin Yun also began cultivating his dual sword stars, and his sword intent made leaps and bounds in the process. His Astral Sword Intent was infinitely close to complete mastery, and the number of galaxies had increased from thirty-six to seventy-two, with each galaxy reaching over a thousand feet.

The two sword stars had also become brighter, like a genuine sun and moon. But despite the improvement in his sword intent, Lin Yun felt that he was short of something before reaching the pinnacle of complete mastery.

This shouldn’t be an issue of resources but comprehension. This required him to comprehend because he couldn't reach the pinnacle of complete mastery by relying on resources alone.

Time flew, and a month had passed. Lin Yun had thoroughly mastered the three variations, with each variation reaching perfection. Furthermore, through his battles with Wang Muyan, he reached the point of being able to control them as he wished. With that, there were only two months to the appearance of the Blue Dragon Record.

Wang Muyan had to leave for the Temporal Realm. Before leaving, she told Lin Yun, “Ye Qingtian, the Blue Dragon Record will appear, and a Golden Era will arrive. A Golden Era also means chaos, just like the previous Golden Era. Geniuses will shine brightly, and even geniuses will be outshone by other geniuses. Even if you’re a genius, you might fall during the Golden Era.”

Lin Yun smiled, “Who isn’t a genius? This is life. The moment I stepped onto sword dao, I didn’t have a choice, and I didn’t have a path of retreat.”

Wang Muyan’s face changed. She hesitated to speak, but finally said, “Take care of yourself. Don’t die before me.”

She turned her head and left after saying that. They knew that she couldn’t smile and address herself as ‘Big Sister’ the next time they would meet.

“How great would it be if she’s not the Blood Moon Divine Maiden…” Lin Yun muttered, watching Wang Muyan as she entered the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. Over the past month, he realized Wang Muyan wasn’t like he had imagined.

“I also feel the same. She’s a good lady. Big Sister only wants your body, but you want Big Sister’s heart. Should I say that it’s expected of you?” Lil’ Purple sighed within the Iris Secret Realm.

Lil’ Purple had recently been mimicking the way Wang Muyan spoke. Despite his reluctance, Lin Yun retracted his gaze after Wang Muyan entered the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. When he turned around, he saw someone that he had never expected. This person was Bai Shuying’s younger sister, Bai Qingyu.

It had been a long time since he had seen her, so he smiled, “Junior Sister Qingyu, are you also here for the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda?”

Bai Qingyu furiously said, “I’m here for you. You only know about being together with that vixen, but I’ve waited for you for a month. I nearly went insane from the anxiety of waiting for you.”

“Slow down. Relax and speak,” Lin Yun said with an awkward smile as he left the mountain.

“Senior Brother Ye, the Eastern Desolation fell into chaos while you’re spending time with that vixen,” Bai Qingyu said.

As she explained, Lin Yun finally realized that the Eastern Desolation had plunged into chaos. After knowing that the Blue Dragon Record would appear within the Eastern Desolation, the geniuses from various holy lands have gathered, and it was easy for chaos to occur. After all, who wouldn’t want to forge a name for themselves?

Almost every day, there would be a battle between the holy lands’ disciples, and everyone wanted to forge a name for themselves before the Blue Dragon Record appeared. Then again, some purely wanted to spar with experts.

Aside from that, treasures began to appear within the secret realms of the Eastern Desolation. Perhaps because the Blue Dragon Record was about to appear, treasures began to appear within the Eastern Desolation, and the competition was intense. After all, everyone wanted to increase their strength before the Blue Dragon Record appeared, and no one wanted to miss this opportunity. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Bai Qingyu could only watch as others obtained opportunities while Ye Qingtian spent his time with Wang Muyan. This naturally made her furious to the point of wanting to tear Wang Muyan apart.

“The Golden Lotus Flametree will appear, and you can’t miss it,” Bai Qingyu said. From her calculations, the Blue Dragon Record would soon appear. So she naturally became anxious that her respected Ye Qingtian still hadn’t reached the Quasi-Saint Realm.

After seeing Bai Qingyu talking about it seriously, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling helpless and didn’t know how to explain to her that he didn’t spend his time doing nothing.

“Alright, I promise you I’ll go,” Lin Yun said.

Hearing that, Bai Qingyu rejoiced, “Hehe. Let’s go. I’ll bring you to see Big Brother Yunfeng.”

She was just angry with Ye Qingtian a moment ago, but she smiled as soon as he promised her.

But Lin Yun couldn’t help finding Bai Yunfeng’s name familiar. Isn’t that the guy who fought with Zhao Tianyu that night? If Bai Yunfeng is leading the party…Lin Yun instantly regretted his promise to Bai Qingyu.
