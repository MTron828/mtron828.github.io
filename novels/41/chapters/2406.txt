Chapter 2407 - Unrivaled!

When Lin Yun’s sword intent was released, the entire Heavenly Saint Courtyard began to boil, with many swordsmen becoming excited.

Jiang Yi squinted, and his face sank, “You think sword intent is invincible? Take my palm! Great Phaseless Dragon-Subduing Palm!”

As the aura he gave off reached the height of a Saint Sovereign, his speed broke the limit.

But Lin Yun raised his brow with a light shining brightly in his eyes. He saw every change with his Bright Sun Sword Intent. Before Jiang Yi could even get close, a mighty gale made Lin Yun’s hair violently flutter in the wind. Paired with his fluttering hair, Lin Yun looked like a sword immortal.

Jiang Yi’s figure became uncertain before he appeared above Lin Yun, pushing his palm down. Golden flames blazed like a bright sun behind him, with the Myriad Phaseless Divine Eye blazing, looking like a descending massive Buddha. His palm also overlapped with that massive palm.

The Great Phaseless Dragon-Subduing Palm was a terrifying palm technique, and a Buddha once used this to subdue a pure-blooded divine dragon with this palm technique in chaotic times. His palm was like the palm of an enormous Buddha that had descended.

Looking at Jiang Yi and Lin Yun approaching one another, a majestic scene was formed, making it look as though time had stopped. Jiang Yi roared, “Die!”

“Break!” Lin Yun turned around as he divided himself into two through the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, each one swinging a sword. The two sword rays were massive and clashed with the descending palm.

When the two attacks clashed, they couldn’t hear a thing and could only see a distorted scene with a powerful shockwave enveloping the entire stage.

Not long after, the golden flames had dispersed and the palm was severed into ten by the sword rays. A loud explosion occurred as Jiang Yi was sent flying back and could only stabilize himself after taking a few steps back. There were two terrifying wounds on his chest with blood flowing down. This made Jiang Yi’s face sinister, and an even more terrifying aura swept out from him.

“You’re not dead?” Compared to him, Lin Yun gracefully landed on the stage. He frowned, realizing that the saint energy refined by the Great Phaseles Divine Art was so powerful that his Bright Sun Sword Intent failed to tear Jiang Yi into pieces.

“I said that sword intent isn’t invincible. So what if you've grasped the Bright Sun Sword Intent? You’re still tender!” When Jiang Yi finished speaking, a dao flower representing an Eternal Dao appeared behind him. He coldly said, “This is my true trump card, the Truth Dao!”

Truth Dao was the most overbearing amongst the nine Eternal Daos. When he released his Truth Dao, patterns began to envelop his body that made heaven and earth become dim.

“This...” Everyone’s faces changed.

Many people were shocked by the appearance of Truth Dao because the Great Phaseless Divine Art was already powerful, and no one expected that Jiang Yi had also grasped an Eternal Dao.

“The so-called ‘Sword Dao' is just a joke. Flower Burial, bring out your Yin-Yang Dao and let me see your real trump card. Stop messing around with your sword.” Jiang Yi wore a sinister expression and no longer dared to belittle Lin Yun. He even had a hint of respect in his eyes when he looked at him, which meant that he had acknowledged Lin Yun as his opponent. But he was fearless despite knowing that Lin Yun still had trump cards, and this was his pride as a divine son.

Under the massive pressure, Lin Yun couldn’t help taking a few steps back with his sword aura collapsing. If he didn’t use his Eternal Dao, he couldn’t withstand another Eternal Dao by relying on his sword intent alone. He tried to resist the pressure, but it was too powerful, forcing him to continue retreating.

“Lin Yun, I wish to know which one you will use first, the Yin-Yang Dao, or Sword Dao. How can there be true swordsmen when everything is nothing before Eternal Daos...?” Jiang Yi said as he circulated the Truth Dao with the dao flower revolving rapidly. But that wasn’t all. He kept flicking his fingers out, shooting ten beams from them.

Lin Yun’s Bright Sun Sword Intent was on the verge of collapse, making everyone exclaim, especially the swordsmen. They all wore bitter expressions because Sword Dao was a Sovereign Dao, and the nine Eternal Daos naturally suppressed it.

It was fine beneath the Saint Realm, but the difference would become obvious after one became a Saint. If Lin Yun didn’t take it well, his heart as a swordsman would shatter.

“Ha.” Bai Yuchen sighed and shook his head. He knew the outcome the best because when swordsmen comprehended an Eternal Dao, they would have to prioritize between an Eternal Dao or Sword Dao. No matter which one they prioritized, this was a choice that swordsmen had to make. There wasn’t any swordsman at the top of the pyramid, only cultivators who used swords.

“Haha, that frightened me earlier. So what if he grasped the Bright Sun Sword Intent?” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son stood out again, knowing Lin Yun would surely be defeated even if he used his Yin-Yang Dao.

If Lin Yun used his Yin-Yang Dao under Jiang Yi’s words, his heart as a swordsman would shatter. One could imagine the consequences if a peerless prodigy swordsman lost his heart as a swordsman. This was why the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was certain that Lin Yun would die.

“Still not going to use your Yin-Yang Dao? You have to bring it out sooner or later. If your heart as a swordsman doesn’t shatter, how can you step into eternality? Or do you think your sword intent can rival my Truth Dao?” Jiang Yi smiled, believing that Sword Dao was nothing before an Eternal Dao. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Well, it’s not impossible,” Lin Yun said as his gaze became sharp. He raised his sword at Jiang Yi before raising the other end to his left cheek. When a shattering sound spread, the bright sun in Lin Yun’s sword sea blazed.

When the shackles broke again, a certain restriction seemed to have been broken as the golden azure dragon opened its eyes within the bright sun. When another shackle broke, the golden human also opened his eyes.

A dazzling golden radiance shone on Lin Yun’s forehead as his dual sword souls merged with his Bright Sun Sword Intent. They flew out from his sword sea before merging into his Flower Burial Sword. As a golden radiance shone from him, the ground shattered with the sky becoming dark.

A radiant sword vibration echoed from Lin Yun’s body, catching many people by surprise, and they threw out blood. When his sword aura swept out, half of the city was enveloped in it and everyone was losing control of their swords. Soon after, they flew into the sky and headed to the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage.

“Damn it, what’s going on?”

“Why can’t I control my sword?”

“What the hell is going on?”

Aside from those strong enough to suppress their swords, everyone’s swords flew over. But that wasn’t all. Nine thousand ribbons that were engraved with divine runes flew out like a waterfall as the countless swords revolved around Lin Yun, giving him the appearance of the king of all swords. This Bright Sun Sword Intent was unique to Lin Yun, and this scene made everyone stand up in disbelief. As for the swordsmen present, they were suffering a huge blow and shock.

“None of the three thousand daos can stop me, and only I am the true immortal!” Lin Yun laughed as he thrusted his sword forth, unleashing the pride of a swordsman.

The sword ray pierced through Jiang Yi’s chest, but that wasn’t all. The sword ray continued on, smashing the dao flower representing Truth Dao apart.

Lin Yun’s sword was too fast, and the Truth Dao immediately shattered. Jiang Yi was also sent flying away, with his face becoming terrifyingly pale after he managed to stabilize himself.

“Unconvinced? Divine son? Don’t try and test my heart as a swordsman because even I am afraid of myself when I become arrogant.” Lin Yun breathed out, looking exhausted, but he was standing upright.

The souls of everyone in the surrounding area trembled as they looked at Lin Yun because he was too strong, which was the true meaning of invincible!

“Holy shit! That scared the shit out of me!”

“That was too unbelievable. Holy shit, this is how a true swordsman should be!”

“I feel that what Flower Burial said wasn’t wrong, and I’m afraid that he might cut himself if he becomes arrogant.” The emotions of all the swordsmen present became high and emotional.

“Three thousand Greater Daos, but only the Sword is supreme! Flower Burial is unrivaled, suppressing the geniuses of an entire generation!” Someone laughed. This voice contained a certain profundity that could penetrate space and time. The person who spoke had an unimaginable cultivation.

Everyone rejoiced and became excited, with their cheers echoing, ““Flower Burial is unrivaled, suppressing the geniuses of an entire generation!””
