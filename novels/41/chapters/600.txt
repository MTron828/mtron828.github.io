Chapter 601 - Scram

It was just as Lin Yun had guessed, the phenomenon in the Withernorth Sea had attracted everyone’s attention.

“The seal to the empyrean’s tomb has finally weakened.”

“What a powerful phenomenon...incredible…”

“Even if we can’t obtain the empyrean’s legacy from the ancient tomb, it’ll be worth the trip if we can obtain a treasure or two.” All the cultivators who saw the phenomenon were excited.

The Bloodwar Pavilion’s Ji Wuye was wiping the blood off his sword indifferently with dozens of corpses lying beneath his feet. None of the corpses were intact, which reflected Ji Wuye’s nickname as the Bloody Butcher.

Right at this moment, Ji Wuye suddenly raised his head to look at the starry sky afar. Revealing an eerie smile on his face, he licked his lips with a brutal smile, “It has finally appeared. If it took any longer, I would have been bored. I hope that the Astral Pearl won’t disappoint me. I should gather up the Bloodwar Pavilion’s disciples first…”

Even the elites on the rankings knew that they would have an advantage with more numbers. After all, the Astral Pearl was their ultimate goal and there was no need for them to show off.

In tattered ruins, several Ghostflame Sect’s disciples gathered beside Yan Kong. Yan Kong had a pale complexion as he emitted an eerie aura. Just standing around him made others feel uneasy. As one of the two fiendgods, his killing aura wasn’t any weaker than Ji Wuye’s.

“Senior brother, the empyrean’s tomb has emerged!”

“With senior brother’s ability, it won’t be an issue to obtain the empyrean’s legacy.”

“Give us the order and we’ll follow it to the death!” The few disciples looked at Yan Kong with their eyes blazing. They knew that they had to depend on Yan Kong to obtain anything from the empyrean’s tomb.

Yan Kong sneered and said, “Hehe, don’t worry about it. I don’t need anything else aside from the Astral Pearl. If anyone dares to oppose you guys in the tomb, they’ll be opposing me as well. I’ll let them know what’s worse than death!”

Shortly after, Yan Kong shot out towards the empyrean’s tomb.

Two youthful figures stood among a patch of sand dunes. One had a skinny frame carrying an ancient saber on his back and the other had a crimson glow in his eyes. The duo was Pei Yue and Qin An, ranked fifty-eight and fifty-nine on the ranking.

They were both geniuses in the top ten of the outer ranking and they had arrived at the last day. When they spoke, they disregarded many people on the ranking. Additionally, they traveled together after entering the tomb.

“Our greatest opponents should be Ji Wuye and Yan Kong,” said Pei Yue as he looked at the starry sky.

“They might be terrifying, but they’re nothing as long as we work together. The one we really have to be afraid of is the Cloud Trigram Sect’s Xie Yunqiao. I heard that he had grasped the xiantian sword intent at greater mastery.

“With that fellow’s cultivation, it’ll be troublesome if he really grasps the xiantian sword intent at greater mastery.” Pei Yue paused briefly and his tone turned cold, “But we’re not pushovers. He’ll have to consider if he wants to compete with us for the Astral Pearl.”

At the same time, countless people saw the phenomenon in the sky and rushed over without any hesitation. Anyone could imagine that there would be a huge gathering at the empyrean’s tomb and there would also be a brutal battle, even among the elites on the ranking.

Even if someone wanted to take advantage of the situation, they had to consider if they were strong enough to. With the appearance of the empyrean’s tomb, the game had finally begun.

The starry sky was far away, but Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry as he walked together with Mu Chen. The tomb’s seal might have been weakened, but it would still take some time for it to disappear completely.

Furthermore, even if the seal disappears completely, anyone who tries to enter without the sufficient strength would be courting death. The treasures were prepared for the experts, and it had been a rule since ancient times. So as long as you were strong enough, it didn’t matter if you were late.

Three days later, the outline of the empyrean’s tomb finally appeared before Lin Yun and Mu Chen. There were many people swarming over like locusts. As for those who weren’t here, they were probably dead.

Lin Yun and Mu Chen were looking around to find their companions from the Heavenly Sword Sect and Heavenly Province Academy. After all, they shouldn’t have had issues with their strength.

Under the starry sky, many disciples were waiting for the seal to disappear completely. But while they were waiting, an ongoing battle attracted everyone’s attention. Killing was normal in the Withernorth Sea, but there was a reason why this battle had attracted their attention.

Two youths were currently ganging up on a girl. The girl had a delicate figure and spiritual runes were fluctuating around her like flames. Disregarding her looks, her strength alone was worthy of attracting the attention of everyone present.

Someone might stand out to be the hero on an ordinary day, but the two youths who were ganging up on her were both geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking. Because they were working together, they held the upper hand against Mo Ling.

“It’s the Bloodwing Pavilion’s Leng Haoyu and Threesolute Manor’s Lin Zhiyuan. Hehe, the two are actually joining up to deal with the Heavenly Province Academy’s Mo Ling…”

“They’re pretty gutsy. If they really killed Mo Ling, we don’t need to even bring up the Heavenly Province Academy because the Mo Clan itself isn't a pushover.”

“They wouldn’t dare. But the Bloodwing Pavilion and Heavenly Province Academy have a long feud. If Mo Ling is really defeated, I’m afraid that she’ll be humiliated.” Many of the disciples gathered around here felt that Leng Haoyu and Lin Zhiyuan were shameless.

But the two of them were still geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking, so no one dared to interfere in this matter.

“Leng Haoyu, you’ve never improved over the years. Are you such a coward that you need help to fight me?” Mo Ling barked coldly.

“I had thoughts of fighting with you one on one, but I can only get Brother Lin to help me to avoid any unexpected troubles. I let you off in the Flamecloud Mountain Range and this is a rare opportunity that Zhang Yuan isn’t with you!” Leng Haoyu sneered. He didn’t feel ashamed at all as he continued, “Don’t worry, I won’t kill you. However, you can give up on entering the empyrean’s tomb.”

The Bloodwing Pavilion had a deep feud with the Heavenly Province Academy. Since he ran into Mo Ling outside the empyrean’s tomb, he would naturally take action. After all, this was the best opportunity since Mo Ling’s help hadn’t arrived. Furthermore, it would also be easier for him to deal with Lin Yun after getting rid of Mo Ling.

Facing Leng Haoyu and Lin Zhiyuan, Mo Ling didn’t dare to be careless as she pushed her spiritual runes to the limit. The spiritual runes gathered around her suddenly unfolded into nine paintings. It was naturally the third grade spiritual diagram, Ablaze Phoenix Painting.

In the next second, dazzling flames came from the spiritual diagram that left Leng Haoyu and Lin Zhiyuan shocked. They didn’t expect that Mo Ling would be such a tough opponent. Mo Ling was clearly in the disadvantageous position in her cultivation, but her attainments in spiritual runes were shocking.

But Leng Haoyu and Lin Zhiyuan weren’t worried as they both sneered and attacked. Lin Zhiyuan threw out a punch with the Absolutecloud Fist—Infernal Clouds!

Lin Zhiyuan’s punch had created a phenomenon as a sea of flames gushed out of his fist. On the other side, Leng Haoyu pushed the Bloodwar Art to the limit as strands of crimson aura stretched out and formed a demonic claw that went where his sword went.

When the punch and sword attacked the spiritual diagram, cracks began to appear on the Ablaze Phoenix Painting.

“This is bad, Mo Ling is going to lose!” Those who saw this scene had changes to their faces. They could imagine Mo Ling getting heavily injured once the painting shattered.

The Ablaze Phoenix Painting ultimately broke into pieces as Leng Haoyu and Lin Zhiyuan charged out. But when they moved forward, the first person they saw wasn’t Mo Ling, but an azure figure.

“You guys dare to touch my senior sister? You must be courting death!” The azure-clothed figure then threw out a punch and barked, “Scram!”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
