Chapter 1673 – Separation

We only have one day left? Lin Yun’s pupils were saddened when he heard Lil' purple’s words. He felt that time had passed too quickly. After today, it would be hard for him to meet Lil’ Purple again.

“Come on. Let me see this long-lost technique of yours.” Lin Yun said, recollecting his thoughts.

“You and I will both play Praise the Phoenix.” Lil’ Purple said, placing the Divine Jade Bamboo Flute on her lips.

A brief moment later, Lin Yun placed his hands on the zither while Lil’ Purple played the flute, and their music resounded throughout the valley.

The Thunderstorm Zither suddenly felt heavy, and it was tough for him to strum it. This made Lin Yun’s face change. When he raised his head, he noticed Lil’ Purple’s facial expression was as usual, but her momentum became majestic and sharp.

Playing beside Lil’ Purple’s flute music made the music played by Lin Yun feel like a boulder was being sliced into two. Sensing the pain coming from his fingers, Lin Yun quickly raised his right hand and saw blood dripping down. “You’re serious?”

There was no reaction from Lil’ Purple, but her music became sharper, and a Phoenix Tree rose behind her with birds descending on it. Some fell on the tree, some hovered in the sky, and some landed on the ground.

Lin Yun's expression became serious, and he played the zither again. This time, he infused all his sword intent into the zither.

It didn’t take long for them to finish playing Praise the Phoenix. As two phoenixes' cries echoed in the sky, they clashed together, and the phoenix that belonged to Lin Yun unleashed a terrifying thunderstorm. The phoenix emitted a powerful aura that looked sinister.

“Open!” Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind, and he flicked his finger out. The phoenix that belonged to Lin Yun spread its wings with lightning ready to explode. But just when it was about to explode, Lil’ Purple’s flute music suddenly became steep, and her fingers blurred. The speed of her ten fingers reached an alarming rate, and a massive aura exploded from her.

It didn’t take long for her to shine with a silver radiance, and another phoenix appeared in the sky. But that wasn’t all. Lil’ Purple’s music changed again, and another two phoenixes appeared. The phoenixes instantly tore the phoenix that Lin Yun summoned into pieces. As Lin Yun’s music became chaotic, he threw out a mouthful of blood.

All of the phenomena he created was torn into pieces, and the zither’s string would’ve snapped if the Thunderstorm Zither was an ordinary one. But even so, Lin Yun still suffered injuries.

“What technique is that?” Lin Yun asked, wiping the blood off his lips.

“Divine Phoenix Touch.” Lil’ Purple said. “But it’s impossible for you to learn it all in just one day. Just focus on reaching the initial stage.”

Lil’ Purple and Lin Yun spent the remaining time learning the Divine Phoenix Touch. They worked on Lin Yun’s foundation for the previous nine days. But because Lin Yun has been practicing the Phoenix Heart Song, his learning speed was fast.

Lin Yun played the Phoenix Heart Song as the snow descended, and his figure gradually blurred. Under the moonlight, Lin Yun sat before the zither. He clearly didn’t move, but he gave off a feeling that he was moving around.

When the zither music reached the climax, Lin Yun emitted a faint saint radiance, accompanied by a powerful aura. It was as if he had undergone a rebirth and became a phoenix. Since Lin Yun was entirely focused on the music, he didn’t realize that he had devoted all of his mental energy to the music.

As the zither music quietly changed, a breeze blew through the valley, reaching every single corner. As the zither music changed, the music had synced entirely with the wind. The wind was gentle when the music was gentle, and the wind was violent when the music became rushed.

A brief moment later, lightning also came. Purple lightning flickered and crackled on the zither, turning into notes, turning the lightning into swords. When wind and lightning combined, the Thunderstorm Zither came to life, and Lin Yun’s hair fluttered violently. As thunderstorms raged, this made heaven and earth start trembling.

When Lin Yun finally reached his limit, the music became chaotic, and a massive power exploded from the Thunderstorm Zither. The ground trembled, and the violent storm eradicated all life in the valley.

Suddenly, Lin Yun subconsciously merged his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent into the zither, perfectly fusing with the collapsing music for a moment. He wasn’t controlling his sword intent with his music, nor was it the other way around. But he had perfectly merged them.

Auspicious phenomena descended from the sky, restoring the valley and bringing new life to the withered flowers. That was the Saint Tone. A long time later, Lin Yun placed both hands on the zither to stop the strings from vibrating.

“Divine Phoenix Touch, Saint Tone.” Lin Yun muttered, looking at the falling snow. At this moment, he knew that he had broken through his limit. When his Noble Tone became the Saint Tone, he also managed to enter the threshold of the Divine Phoenix Touch, with everything flowing smoothly without any hindrance.

“You’re brilliant, for a scumbag.” Lil’ Purple slowly walked over. She was also surprised by Lin Yun’s performance.

“I succeeded.” Lin Yun carried the Thunderstorm Zither and walked over.

“Not bad, I guess. Your Saint Tone is only at the entry-level, and it is divided into nine grades. You’re barely at the first-grade Saint Tone. Your Divine Phoenix Touch is also pale in comparison to me, and you didn’t even grasp one-thousandth of its profundity.” Lil’ Purple said with disdain.

“Let me play music for you.” Lin Yun smiled and didn’t argue with her. They would go their separate ways when dawn came. He had a lot to say, but he decided to play the zither after a brief pondering.

“I want to listen to Praise the Phoenix.” Lil’ Purple demanded.

“Okay.” Lin Yun briefly tested the zither’s cords before he started playing it. He didn’t infuse his sword intent into it, but purely played the music. As a flock of birds flew over, they soared up the Phoenix Tree under the snowfall.

Lil’ Purple laid beneath the Phoenix Tree with the birds surrounding her. Some landed on her shoulders, while some landed before her. At this moment, she was like a genuine phoenix. This was a gorgeous scene.

Lin Yun continued with the songs he had learned over the past nine days when the music ended. There was always a farewell in life, and there weren’t any songs that didn’t have an ending. When dawn came, Lin Yun was finally done playing the zither.

When the first light of dawn broke through the horizon, Lin Yun looked at the rising sun and said, “Dawn has come.”

“Yeah.” Lil’ Purple yawned before she sighed, “Time to leave.”

As she got up and patted the snow stuck to her, she handed the Divine Jade Bamboo Flute to Lin Yun, “You keep this with you.”

“What about you?”

“I don’t need any external objects. Just an ordinary musical instrument will suffice. You can just give me the sword box.” Lil’ Purple said.

Hearing that, Lin Yun removed the sword box he had been carrying. Ever since he had obtained it, this became the first time he had given it to someone else on his own accord. When he removed the sword box, he suddenly felt that his body had become much lighter, like he had put down a mountain.

Lin Yun knew that it was time for them to part. He had to head towards the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea, while Lil’ Purple still had to search for clues of the other Sovereign Divine Runes.

“There’s something else that I have never told anyone.” Lin Yun said, looking at Lil’ Purple. “Since you have a speculation about the ‘broken sword’ within my body, I shouldn’t be keeping this hidden from you. After all, the sword might be related to your search for the Sovereign Divine Runes.”

“Oh?” Lil’ Purple exclaimed with curiosity.

But Lin Yun suddenly fell into deep thoughts because he had no idea where to start.

“What’s wrong?” Lil’ Purple furrowed her brows because this was the first time she saw Lin Yun so hesitant.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun smiled, “I have no idea where to start. Perhaps you might not believe what I’m about to say, but I promise that what I’m about to say is the absolute truth. I do not belong in this world; the place I was from is called Earth. Over there, we have Mount Kunlun, Mount Tai, and various legends…”

Lil’ Purple was briefly stunned before her pupils were filled with shock.

“I was brought to this world at the pinnacle of Mount Tai by a sword ray, but I can feel that I’m Lin Yun. I didn’t occupy this body by force, but the Lin Yun from Earth and the one from the Profound Amber Realm are one person, so my soul was split into two. But after I was brought here, my two souls completely fused…” Lin Yun shared his long kept secret with Lil’ Purple.

He had doubted himself multiple times, but he could clearly sense that he was the rightful owner of this body. The two souls were meant to be one, but they were incomplete before until that sword ray brought the other half of his soul over.

“Ancient Kunlun.” Lil’ Purple said.

“What?” Lin Yun asked, baffled.

“The place you spoke of might be Ancient Kunlun. There are records in the Divine Phoenix Clan that there’s an Ancient Kunlun beyond the Kunlun Realm. But it wasn’t from ancient or primordial times, and it just has an ‘Ancient’ in the name. That was the origin of the Kunlun Realm, but I have been treating it as a legend because it’s too far away. It turns out that it exists.” Lil’ Purple said.

“Ancient Kunlun exists?” Lin Yun became emotional when he heard that.

“I’m not sure because no one has gone there before, and not many people know about it. It is a legend among legends.” Lil’ Purple replied.

“No one has gone there before?”

“If there is anyone who has gone there before, it can only be the Ancestral Deity of the legend.” Lil’ Purple said. “Why are you telling me this? This should be your greatest secret, right?”

“I hope to help you, even if there’s the slightest chance my story can help you.” Lin Yun smiled. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lil’ Purple was speechless before she bit on her lip, “Remember to tell no one about this, not anyone. It is best if you forget about it yourself.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun smiled.

“You can leave now. I don’t wish to see someone as stupid as you for another second.” Lil’ Purple turned her head away.

Seeing that she was chasing him away, Lin Yun instantly became unhappy. But when he saw that she still had the blanket draped over herself, he awkwardly said, “Will you keep the blanket?”

“I can’t.”

“Why?”

“Sorrowness and happiness will fade with time, but embarrassment won’t. I want you to keep remembering me.” Lil’ Purple said, but she didn’t dare to look Lin Yun straight.

“Alright, then. I’ll get going now, so remember to take care of yourself. Let us meet again in the Heavenly Dao Sect.” Lin Yun said.

When Lin Yun left the valley, he would turn his head back whenever he took three steps forth. When he reached the massive river, he could hear a song resounding from afar. This song was so ethereal and intoxicating that it even calmed the surging river.

Upon hearing this song, it became deeply engraved within his heart. Something came to his mind as Lin Yun hummed along with the song. When he turned back, he could see a blurred figure singing in the fog at the top of the snowy mountain.

The lass, a hundred thousand years old, was singing Courting Phoenix as she wiped her tears, and only she knew the meaning behind her song.
