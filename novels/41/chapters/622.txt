Chapter 623 - Losing Everything with a Single Loss

The shining light was more dazzling than the sun behind Lin Yun. The terrifying sword ray contained within this attack was unbelievably massive. Under the intense collision, the lake suddenly exploded and shocked the spectators outside the Withernorth Sea.

“What a terrifying move…” Both Lin Yun’s sword array and Ji Wuye’s executioner stage were terrifyingly strong, and had exceeded everyone’s expectation. This meant that Lin Yun and Ji Wuye’s strength had far surpassed them.

“Who won?” Everyone was anxiously waiting for the dust to settle. There was no question that the loser of this collision would lose the competition. Lin Yun and Ji Wuye were both at their limits, and if they lost, all the advantages they had accumulated at the beginning would go down the drain.

“Senior Tang, you…” Mo Ling looked at Tang Yu nervously. With her cultivation, she couldn’t tell who had obtained the upper hand in this fight. The wait was simply torturous.

Tang Yu shook his head, “The starry sky is a projection, so I can’t see things clearly.”

The phenomenon caused by Lin Yun and Ji Wuye’s clash was too intense. The origin energy fluctuation was chaotic, so the other Heavenly Province Academy’s experts couldn’t see clearly.

Right at this moment, Tang Yu suddenly squinted his eyes. In that split second, a dazzling light exploded out from the starry sky that lasted for a brief second before it disappeared.

Once the light became dim, the crowd knew that the final outcome was here. This caused everyone’s hearts to lift as they wondered who would be the last one standing. Would Lin Yun’s sword array prevail or would he be crushed under the executioner stage.

Everyone was anxious to know the results, but it was a pity that the scenes projected were still chaotic. When the chaos in the projection gradually settled down, the violent fluctuation also began to calm down.

When everything cleared up, Lin Yun was seen holding onto his sword while the stage was on the verge of being split into two.

“It’s Lin Yun!” Everyone’s heart jolted violently as they were filled in shock, especially those on the top ten of the outer ranking. Their faces had changed drastically because they were confident that Lin Yun would lose the battle. But it was clear that Lin Yun had the upper hand now.

“Not yet, the stage still hasn’t dissipated…”

“That’s right. Lin Yun’s sword wasn’t able to split it in half completely, which means that Ji Wuye is still holding on. If Lin Yun runs out of energy, he’ll be the one that loses.” Those in the top ten muttered as they still firmly believed that Lin Yun would lose.

But the stalemate didn’t last for long as Lin Yun’s sword continued splitting the stage into two. The stage was trembling as the nine ancient chains were crumbling.

“Ji Wuye is going to lose.” Someone exclaimed. Those who still believed that Ji Wuye would win were dumbfounded.

“You lost…” Lin Yun looked at Ji Wuye with traces of blood leaking down from his lips. His face was pale and the skin on his forehead was torn with blood flowing down. Clearly, it wasn’t easy for Lin Yun to circulate the Iris Sword sutra nine times, so he had suffered injuries in the collision as well.

Ji Wuye’s face was dark at this moment as he could sense a surging sword intent coming from Lin Yun. He had never seen such a powerful sword intent in his life, not to mention the power contained in Lin Yun’s previous attack. But there was no way he could admit defeat.

Ji Wuye’s eyes flashed ferociously as he spat out a mouthful of blood on the tottering stage. Supported by the mouthful of blood, the stage surged with crimson light once more as the nine chains swung around violently.

“I haven’t lost yet!” Ji Wuye’s face turned even paler with rage burning in his pupils as he looked at Lin Yun. Although the hatred was deep, Ji Wuye’s retaliation was nothing to Lin Yun.

In terms of ruthlessness, Lin Yun was confident that he wasn’t inferior to Ji Wuye. He came so far by being ruthless to both himself and his enemies, so he was certain that no one had suffered more pain than him.

If Ji Wuye thought that this was despair, then he would tell Ji Wuye that it was just the beginning. Real despair was when you couldn’t even see your opponent. True despair was to feel powerless when looking at those dying in front of you when you wanted to protect them. Compared to Lin Yun, Ji Wuye was a lot more inferior.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as the indifference made his facial expression look more sinister. Then, he began to pour all the energy from the sword intent into his Flower Burial Sword. With so much power coursing through his body, Lin Yun also began to feel pain everywhere in his body despite his powerful physique. However, his gaze was as determined as ever.

Just when he was about to draw all of the power from the array, Lin Yun raised his brow and roared, “Break!”

The silver light on the Flower Burial Sword grew violently and enveloped the crimson light coming from the stage. Under the brilliant sword buzz, the sword went through the stage and broke it into pieces. Everyone was shocked.

When the stage shattered, Ji Wuye threw up a mouthful of blood as he collapsed onto the ground. His domain also exploded since he could no longer maintain it against Lin Yun’s sword intent. Throwing up another mouthful of blood, Ji Wuye fell a few hundred meters away.

“The domain broke apart…” The spectators outside the Withernorth Sea exclaimed as they looked at this scene with disbelief. No one had expected that Ji Wuye would lose so badly. Right now, it was difficult for Ji Wuye to even get back on his feet while Lin Yun stood gracefully.

Those on the top ten of the outer ranking looked at this scene with disbelief. They couldn’t believe that Ji Wuye lost to someone who wasn’t even on the ranking.

Every time that Ji Wuye coughed, he would spit up traces of blood. He over exhausted himself, but his current state wasn’t just because he exhausted his origin energy.

At this moment, his eyes were radiating with unwillingness to accept defeat. However, just when he was about to make a move, a pair of cold eyes looked at him, “You want to bring out your martial soul? I advise you not to. If your martial soul is destroyed, then there’s no meaning in you reaching the Yin-Yang stage.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ji Wuye’s face turned stiff when he heard that as he could sense a chill run down his spine from Lin Yun’s cold gaze. It was as if Lin Yun’s sword would stab him without any hesitation if he dared to move. Looking at Lin Yun’s gaze, he lost all courage to use his martial soul to make a last stand.

“The victor has emerged!” A voice sounded out in his mind while he felt powerless. Ji Wuye’s heart was instantly consumed with fear as he cried out, “N-n-no!”

But his cry was futile as he was already deemed the loser by the empyrean’s will. He was instantly teleported out like those who were eliminated during the earlier trials. So what if he was the Bloody Butcher? He still lost everything with a single loss.
