Chapter 1043 - He’ll Come

Lin Yun took out a Blood Flame Pellet to restore his exhausted vitality. As his vitality began to surge, his heart throbbed powerfully and his face became rosy. At this point, he was calm and no longer burned up when using the Blood Flame Pellet.

The vitality in his body was unbelievably vigorous as he made great improvements in the Azure Dragon Saint Art. Since his vitality was getting stronger, his physique and recovery were getting better.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to recover half of his vitality. He knew that he was at a critical moment in his cultivation, so he persevered through his exhaustion and practiced the ‘Heaven and Earth, Unite’ move once more. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

If Lin Yun could grasp the true intent of the move, he could control it as he wished. He already grasped the essence of it, so he just needed a little more practice.

A few hours had passed without him knowing, and he could control ‘Heaven and Earth, Unite’ a bit better. He could only imagine how terrifying his technique would be upon reaching greater mastery.

Every time the primal chaos energy successfully merged, the violent energy would surge wildly in his body. The primal chaos energy enveloped his heart like black flames, causing heaven and earth to tremble. Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how powerful it would be if he unleashed an attack. It definitely wasn’t something the likes of the Heavenly Soul Realm could grasp.

With his vitality completely exhausted, Lin Yun laid on the ground. After consuming many Blood Flame Pellets to practice the Divine Solar Lunar Fist, his body was on the verge of collapse. However, Lin Yun was trying his best to relax and recover naturally. And the moment he closed his eyes, he fell asleep.

When sunlight peeked through the clouds the next morning, Lin Yun fought his heavy eyelids to wake up. He had never felt so relaxed that he wanted to continue sleeping. It was with great difficulty that he opened his eyes under the warm sun.

“I wonder how Yue Weiwei is?” Lin Yun muttered.

In Wind Mound City there was a dark prison a few hundred meters tall. It was completely sealed with only one hole the size of a bowl. Light passed through the small hole and shined on a young girl.

Her once dazzling red dress looked simple. When the light shined on her face, it revealed a terrifyingly pale complexion. The young girl was Yue Weiwei, who had been kept here for a long time. She was here for such a long time that she was deprived of all water.

Her bewitching temperament had become plain, but she still seemed extraordinary. Even while imprisoned, she didn’t seem panicked. She merely stared at the hole and prayed.

Mother, wait for me. I will come back to you to wake you up from your slumber.

Right at this moment, footsteps sounded out that caused Yue Weiwei’s face to change. Even as a captive, she still attracted the gaze of the Nether Divinity Realm Son. A brief moment later, he said, “Miss Weiwei, you’re still not going to tell us your origin?”

Yue Weiwei stayed silent and didn’t utter a single word. For a while now, the Realm Sons knew that Yue Weiwei’s origin wasn’t simple. So they tried their best to uncover her identity. It was a shame that news wasn’t easy to come by in the Heavenly Path.

“We have no intention of making you an enemy of ours as long as you’re willing to hand the Divine Blood Fruit over. We can even erase all our previous grudges,” said the Nether Divinity Realm Son calmly.

“Yue Weiwei, don’t push it! We’re already treating you well. Many of our men died in your hands. Do you really think we would keep you alive if it wasn’t for your background? If you insist on being stubborn, we’ll have to resort to torturing you!” The Profound Dragon Realm Son said with cold eyes.

“Those who died in my hands were greedy, so you can do whatever you want. Well, that depends on whether or not you have the ability to do so,” mocked Yue Weiwei. “I’m pretty sure you don’t even dare to do that. If I want, I can destroy the Divine Blood Fruit any time I want.”

Yue Weiwei spoke with pride that left the Profound Dragon Realm Son gnashing his teeth in anger.

“You guys can leave first. I want to speak to her in private,” said the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

The Profound Dragon Realm Son and Elysium Trigram Realm Son exchanged a glance, but they didn’t question the Nether Divinity Realm Son. After all, he was the leader among the three of them. They were all from saint clans, but the Nether Divinity War Realm had a stronger foundation. Then again, the Nether Divinity Realm Son also invited an elder of a powerful sect to capture Yue Weiwei. It was a risky action that showed the position of the Nether Divinity Realm Son in the Heavenly Path.

When the two Realm Sons left, the Nether Divinity Realm Son smiled, “I figured out the reason why you won’t accept me.”

“You finally acknowledge that you’re a pig? You can stop bothering me now.” Yue Weiwei said in a mocking tone that nearly made the Nether Divinity Realm Son throw up blood.

Suppressing his anger, the Nether Divinity Realm Son gnashed his teeth, “Lin Yun!”

When he mentioned that name, he saw Yue Weiwei’s body tremble ever so slightly. With that confirmation, the smile on his face became even denser, “I told him that I’ll hold a Demon Slaughtering Assembly ten days from now. He was furious and killed one of my men. It was his warning that we better not touch a strand of your hair. Isn’t that hilarious? A lowly bastard from a lower realm dares to offend a Realm Son?”

“I’m warning you to leave him alone!” Yue Weiwei finally couldn’t hold it back anymore and turned around, looking at the Nether Divinity Realm Son coldly.

“Tsk tsk, so he really is your little lover.” The Nether Divinity Realm Son smiled. “Yue Weiwei, I don’t really understand. How am I, a Realm Son, not a match for you? How am I inferior to that ant?”

“You’re not fit!” Yue Weiwei said coldly as her gaze made the Nether Divinity Realm Son feel a chill in his heart. But shortly after, he smiled as he undressed Yue Weiwei with his eyes. “Very well, maintain that enmity of yours. It will make me happier when you submit to me.”

“Get lost!” Yue Weiwei roared.

“Yue Weiwei, I’ve found your weakness. Haha, let’s see what happens in ten days!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son smiled before turning around.

Yue Weiwei had concern on her face because she knew that Lin Yun would definitely come for her. After all, he told her that anyone who became her enemy would be his enemy. Thinking about his promise to her, Yue Weiwei’s heart sank even more. She didn’t want Lin Yun to come, but she knew that Lin Yun would come no matter what.

In the end, Lin Yun couldn’t be compared to the Realm Sons in terms of schemes. She began to panic because this had never happened despite being imprisoned for so long. Then, she forcibly calmed herself down and started to think of a solution. She couldn’t let Lin Yun die because someone of Lin Yun’s caliber was destined to shine in the Heavenly Path. After all, he had a bright future ahead of him.

When the Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons saw the Nether Divinity Realm Son walking out, they instantly smiled. The Elysium Trigram Realm Son smiled, “You look confident.”

“Her origin doesn’t matter. For someone like her, who hasn’t experienced reality for long, you can get her to submit as long as you find her weakness. Once Lin Yun dies, she will eventually forget about him. After all, he’s only a lowly ant,” replied the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

“We just received some news,” said the Profound Dragon Realm Son. “Someone is helping Lin Yun buy Blood Flame Pellets and True Dragon Saint Liquid in Four Phase City. By the looks of it, he’s buying a lot.”

“Leave him be. It’ll be boring if he’s too weak. Either way, I’ll show him the true meaning of despair!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son smiled coldly.
