Chapter 2272 - Golden Axe

One was a genius from one of the Eight Imperial Clans, while the other was the Heavenly Dragon Lord. So why would they fear the death of a holy land’s genius? At least Lin Yun and Li Feibai weren’t afraid.

On the other hand, Huang Jingyu and Liu Yunlan were stumped with their mouths wide open upon witnessing the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord’s death. Everything happened so quickly, and yet Lin Yun didn’t have the slightest hesitation. But that was a genius of the Myriad Lightning Sect, with a position only second to the holy son of that sect.

“How dare you! You’re in deep trouble now!” Huang Jingyu was enraged after coming to his senses, looking at Lin Yun with boiling murderous intent in his eyes.

Lin Yun raised his brow and said, “You know where my nickname comes from? I can’t be bothered with you, and yet you want to send your neck to me? Don’t worry because he’s only the first person.”

Liu Yunlan’s heart sank as he recalled that Lin Yun was never merciful to his enemies.

“You’re in deep trouble. I initially planned on dealing with you after dealing with her. Do you think that I'm afraid of you?” Huang Jingyu’s face was cold as he repeated what he did earlier, circulating the Sun-Moon Saint Canon and charging at Lin Yun.

He wasn’t weak, to begin with. He also possessed the Sacred Moonlight Ring and the Blood Flame Pill, bringing his cultivation to the fourth-stage Saint Lord. He was confident about being able to suppress Lin Yun.

He felt that the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord died because he was too careless, while he had Liu Yunlan’s help. He knew that Liu Yunlan didn’t bring out his full strength, and that the two were more than enough to deal with Lin Yun. If Lin Yun died, Huang Jingyu would be able to stand out in the Eastern Desolation.

The aura that Huang Jingyu emitted was terrifying. In addition to the domain mimicked by the Sacred Moonlight Ring, he wasn’t any weaker than the Ying River King, who hadn't activated his bloodline. Considering that he was the young sect master of the Ming Cult, he would only be stronger in reality. He unleashed his attack as the sun and moon revolved.

Lin Yun held onto Li Feibai and ducked a few hundred meters to the left to avoid Huang Jingyu’s attack. They clashed a few times, with Lin Yun mainly dodging while gauging Huang Jingyu’s strength. It didn’t take long before he had a rough understanding of Huang Jingyu’s strength.

“You think that you can escape?” Huang Jingyu sneered and threw his punch to the sky as the sun and moon condensed into a ‘Ming’ word. When he reappeared, he gave off a powerful force that greatly pressured Lin Yun.

Relying on the Sun-Moon Saint Canon, Huang Jingyu’s aura as a fourth-stage Saint Lord was pushed to the limit. Huang Jingyu might seem arrogant, but he was a meticulous person.

“Kneel!” Huang Jingyu roared as he descended from the sky with sunlight and moonlight shining down, combining with the domain. Throwing a punch with his right hand that wore the Sacred Moonlight Ring, Huang Jingyu laughed, “Let’s see how you escape this time!”

“Watch out!” Li Feibai said nervously. She might be confident in Lin Yun’s strength, but Huang Jingyu couldn’t be underestimated, since the Blood Flame Pill had greatly boosted his strength.

“Don’t worry about it,” Lin Yun smiled. He already had a gauge of Huang Jingyu’s strength. He quickly threw Li Feibai onto his back and threw out a punch, facing Huang Jingyu’s attack head-on.

Netherflowers bloomed in his eyes as the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron flew up from the depths of his violet palace. When the cauldron flew out, it filled Lin Yun’s body with a boundless energy that poured out through his fist.

With a loud explosion, Huang Jingyu was sent flying a few hundred meters away. But Lin Yun stood unmoving with his hair fluttering in the wind.

“Fakes will always be fake.” Lin Yun looked at Huang Jingyu.

Huang Jingyu looked at this scene with disbelief and couldn’t comprehend what was happening. Liu Yunlan also squinted with doubt in his eyes.

If the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord’s death was because he was too confident in himself, Huang Jingyu shouldn’t have made that mistake after going all out.

“How dare you!” Huang Jingyu pushed the Sun-Moon Saint Canon to the limit and the ‘Ming’ word became even more dazzling.

“Hahaha! Great!” Lin Yun stood before Li Feibai, facing Huang Jingyu head-on. In Huang Jingyu’s domain, he circulated the two sword canons and didn’t suffer any restrictions in his cultivation.

Huang Jingyu held the initial advantage in the domain but soon lost his advantage when the three swords from the Great Profound Sword Canon appeared. When the three swords appeared behind Lin Yun, fine cracks formed on Huang Jingyu’s domain.

When Lin Yun pushed his palm forth, the three swords shone brightly and tore apart the domain, causing Huang Jingyu to throw out a mouthful of blood.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“I might not dare to face you head-on if you’re a genuine fourth-stage Saint Lord. But it’s a pity that you’re not…” Lin Yun sneered and threw his punch forth.

Huang Jingyu’s reaction wasn’t slow as he blocked Lin Yun’s attack. He sneered and reached out, wanting to grab Lin Yun’s hand, “You think I’m a pushover?”

But Lin Yun moved even quicker and slapped Huang Jingyu in the face, causing the latter to fly away and throw out a mouthful of blood before falling to one knee on the ground.

“If the domain was real, I might have my concerns. But it’s a pity that it’s also a fake,” Lin Yun continued to mock Huang Jingyu. He could tell with a glance that the domain was formed with the help of the Sacred Moonlight Ring and was similar to his Azure Dragon Sword Heart.

It was pale when compared to the Ying River King’s domain. The moment he said that, he arrived before Huang Jingyu.

”You’re courting death!” Huang Jingyu was arrogant as he raised his right hand with the Sacred Moonlight Ring. The back of his hand faced Lin Yun as the gem shone brightly with an ancient rune activated.

“You really think that I can’t dodge your slap? Go to hell!” Huang Jingyu sinisterly laughed as he poured his saint energy into the ring, wanting to activate it.

But Lin Yun had predicted this and swiped his fingers like a sword, severing Huang Jingyu’s palm from his wrist. After losing the support of saint energy, the Sacred Moonlight Ring exploded, destroying Huang Jingyu’s hand. The only thing left behind was the Sacred Moonlight Ring.

Lin Yun reached out for the Sacred Moonlight Ring, and said, “This is a pretty good ring, but it belongs to me now.”

“My hand! My hand!” Huang Jingyu screamed out in pain, his eyes red, wanting to go all out with Lin Yun.

“You want to die? It's not so easy…” Lin Yun’s palm landed on Huang Jingyu’s chest, shattering the latter’s saint energy and leaving a crater on his chest. As blood splashed, Huang Jingyu was sent flying away with the aura he gave off diminishing, before falling back to a second-stage Saint Lord. He was holding onto his severed hand while screaming out in pain.

“Flower Burial, that’s enough!” Liu Yunlan couldn’t keep watching any longer and three flowers appeared behind him. They were the Blade Dao, Lightning Dao, and Fire Dao. The three daos began to empower Liu Yunlan’s Astral Blade Intent as he swung his blade, wanting to stop Lin Yun.

He could tell that Lin Yun didn’t want to let Huang Jingyu die as easily as the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord, but this was too ruthless. His blade ray was quickly slicing space apart.

This shocked Li Feibai since she didn’t expect Liu Yunlan to be so powerful. Then again, it made no sense for Liu Yunlan to be weak since he had grasped the pinnacle of Astral Blade Intent, grasped the Blade Dao, and had his cultivation at the second-stage Saint Lord. The moment someone like him makes a move, he wouldn’t hold back, which would be terrifying.

But Lin Yun easily dodged the blade ray and was about to continue when fine cracks appeared in the surrounding space, leaving wounds on his body. Even so, Lin Yun didn’t give up. His eyes were glued on Huang Jingyu. This was because Huang Jingyu had taken it too far back when he was treating Ji Zixi.

“That’s enough!” Liu Yunlan couldn’t hold back any longer and reappeared before Lin Yun with his blade swinging down, unleashing the foundation of his blade technique. Space was like a curtain being separated.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun reached out to his chest, and grabbed the Flower Burial Sword from it before facing Liu Yunlan’s blade with an even faster attack. When they clashed, the blade ray became dim as the blade in Liu Yunlan’s hand snapped into two.

Liu Yunlan’s face became pale as he looked at Lin Yun with disbelief and fear. He could feel his heart beating violently and his mind becoming blank. He could never forget what happened earlier when he saw the golden light shining within Lin Yun’s eyes. That was the Divine Light Sword Intent.

In such a short moment, Liu Yunlan knew that he had lost. The divine light that he pursued had appeared on someone much younger, less than thirty years old.

“Heavenly Sage Saint Lord, save me! Flower Burial killed the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord!” Huang Jingyu screamed as he ran for his life.

Hearing that the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord was dead, the Crow Shot Saint Lord and other Saint Lords from the Myriad Lightning Sect were dumbfounded with disbelief. They couldn’t believe that a monstrous genius died so quickly without any signs.

But they soon came to their senses after seeing the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord’s corpse and flew into a rage.

“Flower Burial, you have taken it too far!” The Crow Shot Saint Lord couldn’t hold back any longer and, ignoring the Astral River Saint Lord, brought out a Sovereign Saint Artifact.

It was a golden axe that gave off a sacred, domineering aura the moment it was brought out. The thunderclouds in the sky shattered as an ancient golden figure appeared, scaring the Astral River Saint Lord into retreating.

But the golden axe wasn’t directed at him, it was flying towards Lin Yun.
