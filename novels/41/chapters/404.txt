Chapter 405 - Happiness and Sorrow

On the streets in front of the Prince Manor was the bustle from galloping hooves and rolling wheels. The entire ground was trembling because the protagonist had finally appeared. An aura blew over, which filled others with endless imagination.

“They’re here!” Everyone became excited when they heard the galloping sounds approaching. They could see a huge group led by eight Dracoscale Horses leading the way. The Dracoscale Horses were horse breeds that possessed a strand of the true dragon’s bloodline. Their bloodline was purer than the Dragon Blooded Horse and they were extremely rare. Even the Divine Guards only had eight of them.

The horses’ golden fur glittered under the sun, making them stand out in the blizzard. They were mostly used as auspicious beasts to welcome guests to the empire and the empire would only use a couple of them normally. It was practically impossible for all eight of them to be used at once.

The riders also looked majestic because you needed a title in the Divine Guards to be known as the Dracoscale Guards. The threshold was the cultivation in the ninth stage. Not only that, but they were also required to have outstanding war merits to receive this honor.

The eight Dracoscale Guards were donned in shining armor and only the crown prince could possibly receive such a treatment. To be honest, the wedding was grander than what most people had imagined.

A hundred meters behind the Dracoscale Guards were eight silver horses pulling a luxurious carriage. The silver carriage was decorated with pearls, which instantly shrouded the entire carriage in a halo.

There were two people seated in the carriage,receiving everyone’s looks. It was naturally the crown prince, Qin Yu, and the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Xin Yan. The crown prince had an extraordinary temperament. So when he wore his ceremonial clothes, he looked even more dashing. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Beside him, Xin Yan wore a phoenix crown and her makeup made her look even more gorgeous. But there wasn’t any expression on her face that made others feel distant from her.

“How beautiful! I’ve long heard that Xin Yan is famous for her beauty in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Now that I look at it, it’s not an understatement to call her the prettiest in the empire.”

“But it’s a pity that she’ll belong to His Highness after today. Then again, His Highness is fully worthy of her.”

“Haha. It’s entirely unlike the royal family’s style to host a wedding in such a hurry. Who knows if there’s any story hidden behind this matter.”

“That’s right. Xin Yan’s big brother had just passed away recently, so it makes no sense for her to be married in such a hurry.”

“I heard that Wang Yan killed Xin Jue under an order from His Highness.”

“Hush. Lower your voice. Don’t run your mouth without any evidence.”

“Evidence? If Xin Jue wasn’t killed by Wang Yan, why would Lin Yun want to kill Wang Yan? Furthermore, who doesn’t know that Wang Yan is Qin Yu’s lackey. Without Qin Yu’s support, there’s no way Wang Yan would dare to kill Xin Jue even if he had the guts.”

“Speaking of which, it’s really a pity for Lin Yun. He’s so talented, but he now has a crippled profound vein. That’s the same as crippling his future.” The commotion sounded out behind the bustling veil. People weren’t easily fooled, which was why Qin Yu made such a grand ostentation to silence the controversy.

But it was a pity that the effects weren’t that good. But no one dared to say it in a loud voice since Qin Yu had a high status in the empire, not to mention that he was also one of the eight titles.

Beside the carriage were experts from the Azure Association. There was Han Lan of the Heavenly Profound Sect, Wang Feng of the Demonic Moon Villa, Ji Wuheng of the Primal Origin Sect, Tang Jie of the Heavenly Qin Institute, and Bai Lixuan of the Sword Firmament Pavilion. They were all elites, second only to the eight titles. THey were also all in the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm.

Bai Lixuan attracted the most attention since his Saint Physique had spread his fame throughout the Great Qin Empire.

“What a huge ostentation. Han Lan, Wang Feng, Ji Wuheng, Tang Jie, and Bai Lixuan. All five of them probably have the strength to compete for the titles.”

“Even if they couldn’t, they shouldn’t be too far from that. They will definitely shine brightly in the Dragon Gate competition at the end of this year.”

“His Highness is a prince for a reason. So many geniuses are willing to play the supporting role for him.”

“Haha, I’m afraid the story behind it isn’t as simple as you guys think.” There were some who knew about the Azure Association’s existence, but none of them revealed it.

Among the crowd, a youth stared at the lady in the carriage with his fists balled. It was Li Wuyou, but Chen Xuanjun was patting his hand from the side to prevent him from being impulsive.

“Senior sister doesn’t look happy at all. She looks no different from a zombie, yet this Qin Yu is still laughing so happily. Are the sect’s elders blind? Are they really going to watch senior sister enter the fire pit?” Li Wuyou gnashed his teeth as his body trembled from rage.

“Xin Yan was the one who agreed. What do you want the sect to do? Kill the crown prince and become the enemy of the entire empire?” Chen Xuanjun sighed and his words made Li Wuyou fall into silence.

The party left behind marks on the ground and the Divine Guards were heading to the Prince Manor in an orderly manner. But when they were halfway there, the party suddenly came to a stop.

“It stopped?”

“What’s going on?”

“Can it be that someone is really here to cause trouble?” The sudden change of events left everyone shocked as they turned to look at the distance. They could see a youth standing there. He was carrying a sword box, wearing a devil mask, and a crimson horse was standing beside him.

The youth appeared out of nowhere, almost as if he had been waiting here for a long time. When everyone looked at the youth and the Dragon Blooded Horse, all of them thought of one person. But then again, they didn’t feel that it was possible. Not only was Lin Yun in the Repent Cliff right now, but he was also a cripple now.

So it was no different than sending himself to die if he was the one who stopped the carriage. Plus, no one was stupid enough to obstruct the crown prince’s wedding.

“Lin Yun?” Han Lan’s face sank. He remembered how Lin Yun crippled his junior brother back in the Princess Manor. If it wasn’t for Xin Jue standing in his way back then, he would’ve already slain this brat.

“Is it really junior brother?” Many Locket Mountain’s disciples became emotional when they saw the youthful figure. But shortly after, they couldn’t help feeling worried for Lin Yun when they recalled how Lin Yun crippled his profound vein.

Under the blizzard, Lin Yun removed his devil mask and revealed his face to the masses. This made the crowd suck in a cold breath when they saw his face. Everyone had heard about the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Lin Yun. He was someone who rang the Phoenix Plum and ascended the tenth level of the Black Lotus Palace.

His prospects should be unimaginable and no one could stop his rise. However, he had violated the sect’s rules by killing Wang Yan in public and had to cripple a profound vein. His declaration of how he did not regret his killings had already spread throughout the empire.

But Bai Lixuan’s appearance slowly made everyone forget about Lin Yun over the past three months. But no one had expected that Lin Yun would show up here.

Lin Yun’s gaze passed through the Dracoscale Guards. His gaze didn’t stop at Han Lan, Bai Lixuan, or Qin Yu. He was only looking at the girl in the carriage.

When Xin Yan looked at Lin Yun standing by himself in the blizzard, her eyes turned watery all of a sudden. She never shed a tear since Xin Jue’s death, but she couldn’t control her tears when she saw the frail yet stubborn figure standing so firmly in the blizzard.

She knew that he would come, which was why she asked Guardian Plum to send him away on an excuse. But she never imagined that he would still come.

It was already foolish enough for him to kill Wang Yan in public, so why did he have to come here? Xin Yan’s vision was soon blurred by her tears as she sighed, “You shouldn’t have come.”

“Why shouldn’t I come?” The youth on the horse smiled and he continued, “Big Sister, you knew that I would be here. I started on the path of swords because I knew that I would have concerns in the world. The blizzard won’t be able to stop me, nor can it stop my sword.”

The wind blew even heavier and the youth rode on the Dragon Blooded Horse pridefully. His words were firm, which shocked everyone.

On the luxurious carriage, Qin Yu’s smile had disappeared and his face was dark.

“Kill him!” barked Han Lan.

In the next second, the Dracoscale Guards turned into the wind as they dashed at Lin Yun with towering killing intent. But Lin Yun had no changes to his face. The sorrow gradually disappeared from his eyes and was replaced with sharpness like a sword.
