Chapter 855 - Rushing to the Profound Amber Mountain

Two months passed in the blink of an eye. On the boundless mountain range at the border of the Ancient Southern Domain, several people were arriving at a towering peak. When they landed on the ground, they looked at each other and discovered that they were part of the top ten.

The four people present were Bai Lixuan, Jiang Ziye, Nangong Wanyu, and Mu Han. They all received jade slips from the Sacred Alliance that guided them to this location.

“It looks like you two benefited quite a bit in the last two months,” said Mu Han as he looked around. He could sense a familiar sword aura from Bai Lixuan. Bai Lixuan’s eyes flickered with lightning with traces of faint dragon aura. Mu Han suspected that Bai Lixuan grasped the Azure Dragon Sword Aura, but he had no idea how strong it was.

As for Jiang Ziye, her cultivation was deep and unfathomable. It felt like she would enter the Heavenly Soul Realm any time. But the fact that she didn’t choose to make a breakthrough meant that her ambition wasn’t small.

“I’m afraid I can’t be compared to you,” smiled Jiang Ziye. She could sense that Mu Han’s sword intent was at the same level as Lin Yun’s sword intent before entering the Dragoncloud Treasury.

“You think I grasped the spiritual sword intent, right?” Mu Han was casual about it, but smiled bitterly, “I made some improvements in the quasi-spiritual sword intent, but I’m still lacking. I now understand what a monster Lin Yun is.”

The higher one’s attainment in the sword path was, the better they would understand how hard it was to grasp the spiritual sword intnet. Mu Han didn’t dare to imagine what kind of terrifying opponent he encountered back then.

Hearing Mu Han’s words, Bai Lixuan, Jiang Ziye, and Nangong Wanyu were surprised. Didn’t this mean that Mu Han’s current strength was inferior to Lin Yun before the Dragoncloud Treasury? Wasn’t that a little too depressing?

As they talked, two more people arrived. The newcomers were Wu Xiaotian and Zhu Qingshan. They met each other along the way, so they decided to come together. However, they remained silent the entire time since they weren’t exactly friends.

“Hehe, what are you guys talking about?” Wu Xiaotian asked in an excited tone. They quickly told Wu Xiaotian what transpired.

“Is Lin Yun really that monstrous? So how strong has Lin Yun become after two months?” Wu Xiaotian sighed.

Jiang Ziye muttered to herself, “There aren’t many quotas for the Heavenly Path. I heard that the five domains only have eight quotas.”

“That little?!”

“Jiang Ziye, how strong are the other geniuses from the other domains?”

"From the previous banquet, Yu Haotian would be in the top five on the Dragoncloud Ranking for the other domains. As for Zhao Wuji and Yan Longzi, they would have difficulty making the top ten. I’m really not sure about this banquet. After all, Lin Yun by himself is already a never before seen variable. The Dragoncloud Treasury appeared because of him and we even got to obtain fortunes…” Jiang Ziye said after a brief hesitation.

She didn’t want to affect anyone’s confidence. After all, the Ancient Southern Domain was ranked at the bottom of the Profound Amber Realm. If Yu Haotian could barely make it into the top five for the other domains, it would be hard for everyone here to make the top ten. It would be even more difficult for any of them to compete for the eight quotas.

Their only hope was that the Dragoncloud Treasury had appeared in the Ancient Southern Domain. Just when the group fell silent, a tornado flickering with lightning swiftly approached.

“What’s that?” Everyone had to squint their eyes from the wind as the incoming thunderstorm intent made them feel uncomfortable. Everyone’s faces became grave as the tornado approached.

“It has been a long time.” In an instant, an azure figure dropped from the sky as the tornado disappeared. It was Lin Yun. He didn’t have much time when the Sacred Alliance gave him the jade slip, so he had to use his tornado to travel.

“Lin Yun!” Bai Lixuan and the others were shocked because they never expected Lin Yun to cause such a phenomenon. They all knew that Lin Yun would become a lot stronger in two months, but not this much. The current Lin Yun felt unfathomable to all of them.

“Brother Lin, isn’t your strength a little too over the top?” Mu Han smiled bitterly as he asked the question that was in everyone’s heart.

Lin Yun held onto Lil’ Red who was in the squirrel form with a smile, but he didn’t say a word. Two months ago, he could easily defeat everyone with the Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Intent. After cultivating the Iris Sword Sutra and Azure Firmament Sword Sutra together, his strength had surpassed every single genius present. He even practiced the Azure Firmament Thirteen Sword, which gave him unparalleled strength. Perhaps only those from the other domains could make him feel some pressure.

“Big Brother Yun looks even more handsome now.” A chuckle sounded out as Yue Weiwei appeared before everyone. This made everyone’s eyes light up. They didn’t know if Lin Yun had become even more handsome after two months, but Yue Weiwei definitely became even more charming.

After a while, Yu Haotian arrived. After recovering from his injuries, there was no change to his appearance. However, he felt like a completely different person as he gave everyone an eerie sensation. He no longer had the domineering aura from before and was more similar to Zhu Qingshan.

Everyone looked at Yu Haotian strangely before moving away from him. Yu Haotian grinned as if he wasn’t concerned by their actions. He didn’t even spare Lin Yun a glance. Instead, he giggled to himself, “Hehe.”

Lin Yun frowned because he could sense a dangerous aura coming from Yu Haotian. However, he couldn’t put that feeling into words. With that, besides Zhao Wuji, everyone was here. No one expected Zhao Wuji to be present though.

At this moment, a golden-winged aerial demonic beast broke through the clouds with a Sacred Alliance elder on its back. The demonic beast flapped its wings and appeared in front of them in a split second. The elder’s arrival caused everyone to be silent.

“Zhao Wuji didn’t die, but he’s been crippled. The Violet Thunder Sect have given up on this opportunity,” said the judge.

Everyone all turned to look at Lin Yun with shock because they never expected that he could cripple Zhao Wuji with one strike. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“My name is Qing Tu and I’ll be taking you guys to the Profound Amber Mountain. Come on.” The judge introduced himself as he looked at everyone present.

Lin Yun and the others jumped onto the back of the aerial demonic beast. The demonic beast was larger than Lin Yun had imagined.

“Let’s go.” Qing Tu gently patted the demonic beast and left. The demonic beast was called a Profound Golden Sparrow. It had a fast speed due to the spiritual runes that were on its wings. Whenever it flapped its wings, the spiritual runes would flicker. This was the first time Lin Yun had ever seen a demonic beast who was born with spiritual runes that formed a complicated array.

The array would circulate as if it was devouring all of the wind attributed spiritual energy in the world. As the group traveled, Qing Tu shared information about the other domains. Qing Tu explained that they were headed for the Profound Amber Mountain, which was a sacred mountain filled with mystery.

There was a city beneath the Profound Amber Mountain called the Lonesky City because the mountain wasn’t a place that anyone could enter. The city naturally became the most popular place in the entire Profound Amber Realm. The group would rest in Lonesky City for a few days before going to the test.

This was the first time Lin Yun heard of the other realms. Aside from the Ancient Southern Domain, there was also the Mound Northern Domain, Mountain Western Domain, Gauze Eastern Domain, and Profound Domain. The Profound Amber Realm had a total of five domains with the Ancient Southern Domain ranked at the bottom. It was practically forgotten by the other domains.

According to Qing Tu’s words, the geniuses of the other domains were a lot stronger. Their champions were at least as strong as Lin Yun. So there was no question that it would be an intense battle if Lin Yun wasn’t even guaranteed a spot based on his strength. After counting out the remaining spots, everyone became grave. Realistically, excluding the champions, there were only three more quotas up for grabs.

“The quotas are limited, so most of you are destined to be eliminated. However, you guys can also obtain the qualification to cultivate in the Profound Amber Mountain. It’ll be a great fortune for you guys even if you guys can’t make it into the Heavenly Path.” Qing Tu turned around and looked at everyone before his gaze stopped on Lin Yun. “Lin Yun, this is a rare opportunity so don’t embarrass the Ancient Southern Domain’s Sacred Alliance. If we can’t even obtain one quota, it’ll be embarrassing for us.”

“There shouldn’t be any problems,” said Lin Yun. He was pretty confident that he could obtain a quota. Otherwise, he would be letting down his fortune in the Dragoncloud Treasury.

Yu Haotian smiled eerily, “It won’t be so certain if the Profound Domain gangs up on you.”

Everyone shot dirty looks at Yu Haotian as soon as they heard his words. After all, this involved the pride of their Ancient Southern Domain. It wasn’t good for the Ancient Southern Domain geniuses to fight among themselves.

Lin Yun fell into deep thought because Yue Weiwei’s advice popped into his head. He had to get rid of Yu Haotian or else Yu Haotian would become a threat to him.

“I’m just speaking casually. Don’t take it to heart.” Yu Haotian smiled casually while shrugging his shoulders.
