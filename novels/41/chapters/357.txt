Chapter 358 - A Formidable Opponent

Speaking of Lin Yun, he was currently in a half-collapsed pavilion. There were over thirty Demonlotus Cores in front of him and most of them had three petals. But the three petals didn’t mean that the lotus only had three petals. It just meant that there were only three petals at the center enveloping the heart.

The rest only had two petals. When comparing the two, the black lotuses with two petals were dimmer than those with three petals. It was a pity that Lin Yun didn’t manage to find any with four petals.

Aside from the Demonlotus Cores, Lin Yun also found a few spiritual herbs. Out of all the spiritual herbs, the Indigofrost Flame Fruit stood out the most. Half of these were harvested by Lin Yun himself and the other half came from killing people. The Indigofrost Flame Fruit was naturally the most valuable one here and it was only by luck that he found it.

The Demonlotus Realm was truly tempting since the harvest of one day was so plentiful. Then again, the brutality of the Demonlotus Realm also sent a chill down Lin Yun’s spine.

Lin Yun made a brief inventory before he stored everything. This wasn’t the time for him to refine his harvest, not to mention that these weren’t enough to bring him to the eighth stage. He wanted to accumulate his resources until he had enough to make a breakthrough.

His figure flashed and he appeared at the top of the pavilion, looking at the ruins of the surrounding collapsed pavilions. There was a bleak and desolate atmosphere that permeated this place.

Although he had seen something similar in the Azure Sun Realm, it was still shocking to see it again. Lin Yun knew that this place used to be a glorious sect in the past, but nothing was left now.

Executing the Seven Profound Steps, Lin Yun hovered in this realm like an eagle. He could see many disciples around this place and the occasional fights whenever a treasure was found. But Lin Yun merely cast his glance at those ‘treasures’ before he ignored them.

Suddenly, Lin Yun turned around and landed on a pile of rubble because a powerful spiritual rune fluctuation attracted his attention. If he had guessed it correctly, there should be an array here.

Lin Yun moved his hands and cleaned up the rubble. A black array appeared before Lin Yun’s eyes. The array's center emitted a faint glow. Lin Yun could only guess that this should be a small-scaled teleportation array.

Lin Yun hesitated briefly before he jumped into the array. It felt like he was falling into an abyss because there was no end to it. When he finally gained his footing, his tensed heart relaxed. When he looked around, he found himself in an ancient chamber.

This chamber was decorated with damaged jade bottles and everything was a mess. He could sense an origin energy fluctuation and sounds of people fighting coming from afar. It looks like this place had multiple entry points and he wasn’t the only one who came here.

Lin Yun briefly listened to the commotion before he started searching the stone chamber. After a quick search, he didn’t find anything precious except for a martial technique plaque. However, the plaque wasn’t complete. Lin Yun placed it against his forehead and absorbed the information contained within.

It contained some words, which was a good thing. After all, the sect’s elders might be able to derive cultivation or martial techniques from it. Storing the jade plaque, Lin Yun exited the chamber and appeared in a passage. Looking at the stone board above him, he could roughly guess that this should be an underground palace. It was as complicated as a maze, but Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry because he didn’t even have a destination in mind.

When he turned around, he entered a second stone chamber. This stone chamber wasn’t any different than the previous one. The only difference was that there were two corpses here and the corpses looked pretty fresh.

The corpses were probably two disciples who fought after coming to the Demonlotus Realm. Lin Yun searched their interspatial pouches, but they didn’t have anything. This meant that they probably already refined their Demonlotus Cores and spiritual herbs.

However, the pouches contained nearly 2,000 second grade spiritual jades, which was a pleasant surprise. The two disciples were probably core disciples who entered two decades ago. It was a pity that the path of cultivation was so difficult because in the end they were reduced to a pile of bones.

After departing from the stone chamber, Lin Yun visited many other stone chambers. Although there wasn't anything of value, there were quite a bit of martial technique plaques. Lin Yun should be able to get a decent sum of second grade spiritual jades for them.

This was the Demonlotus Realm. Even if you didn’t have any encounters, you could still get a decent harvest as long as you had patience. After Lin Yun traveled for a few thousand meters, he could faintly hear a battle coming from afar.

“There must be a treasure that they’re fighting over.” Lin Yun retracted his origin energy and snuck closer. When he reached the far end, he arrived at a vast palace with ceilings decorated in gems that lit up the entire hall.

There were over ten people gathered in the hall. At the center of the hall, there was an old man seated with his head hung low. He was covered in dust and no one knew how long he had died. At the same time, there was also an ancient sword plunged into the ground covered in dust.

“Get lost. This sword is mine. No one is allowed to snatch it from me!”

“Yours? Are you daydreaming?”

“Die!”

“What a bunch of garbage. Get lost!”

Violent origin energy fluctuated as everyone fought over the old man’s ancient sword.

Lin Yun observed the gaze briefly and fell into deep thought. This ancient sword should be a cosmic artifact and it was actually preserved rather well. If he could obtain this sword, it would be equivalent to having insurance for his life.

Just this point alone made the ancient sword extremely tempting. Suddenly, a violent wind blew and everyone was blown away before they could even react. When everyone recovered from their shock, they realized that it wasn’t wind but afterimages.

The owner of the afterimages arrived in front of the old man and grabbed at the ancient sword without any hesitation. This made everyone’s eyes blaze with killing intent. They had been fighting for so long. So how could they allow someone to come and take the sword away?

“Leave the ancient sword behind!”

“You’re courting death. You dare to dip your hands in this matter with your cultivation merely in the seventh stage?”

“Don’t think that we don’t dare to do anything to you just because you’re a disciple of the Sword Firmament Pavilion!”

“Why are we wasting time talking to him? Let’s kill him!”

“Kill!”

Everyone was baffled when they saw that Lin Yun’s cultivation was only in the seventh stage. So they immediately charged at him without any hesitation.

Lin Yun, who was examining the ancient sword, suddenly had a chilling flicker in his eyes. Holding onto the ancient sword, he swung it and unleashed a sword ray.

The ancient sword trembled and the dust on it suddenly flew off. It might seem like a casual swing, but a torrential sword aura was unleashed and instantly killed over ten people on the spot.

“Damn it. We ran into a monster!”

“He’s Lin Yun! He must be Lin Yun of the Sword Firmament Pavilion!” The remaining people looked at Lin Yun with fear and immediately started to run.

“Die!” But just when they reached the entrance, an ancient cauldron roared and over ten people died instantly to a fist. Even those who managed to survive were heavily injured.

“Get lost! Don’t block my way!” A disciple was kicked back like a ball and died when he fell to the ground.

A robust person came out from the passage with a grin on his face. Those who survived the second ordeal immediately took this opportunity to escape.

The Hundred Beast Gate’s Feng Ye? Lin Yun raised his brow once he recognized this person. This was someone who was equally famous as the Demonflame Sect’s Bai Yue. He also ran into Drifting Goblet three years ago and was defeated. This also meant that he was a lot stronger now.

Lin Yun knew that this was a formidable opponent, so he couldn’t afford to be careless. When he fell into deep thought, the ancient sword in his hand snapped. Lin Yun smiled bitterly because he found it odd that his physique did nothing to this sword. Lin Yun never expected that the sword would actually break, especially when he just started to ponder the sword’s origin..

Looking at the broken sword, Feng Ye frowned. He cursed, “Another damaged cosmic artifact. And here I thought that it would be a treasure.”

There were many damaged cosmic artifacts in the Demonlotus Realm. So Feng Ye merely cursed and didn’t think too much about it. When his gaze fell onto Lin Yun, a cold light flashed in his eyes and he smirked.

“The ancient sword is already broken. You still want to come after me?” Lin Yun spoke up to Feng Ye. Lin Yun didn’t want to fight if he had a choice, but that didn’t mean that he was afraid to fight.

“Hehe, you’re pretty strong. I could sense your sword a few hundred meters ago. I bet you must have many treasures on you,” smiled Feng Ye as he stared at Lin Yun’s interspatial pouch.

“I do have quite a lot of treasures. But I’m afraid that you’re not capable enough to take them from me.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It looks like this battle was unavoidable. Lin Yun waved his hand and summoned the Flower Burial Sword from the sword box. The two then faced each other and the surrounding atmosphere started to tense up.

But they didn’t notice that the fingers of the old man, who had died for many years, twitched when the ancient sword broke.
