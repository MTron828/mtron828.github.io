Chapter 2442 - Full Strength!

The Golden-Purple Divine Dragon was grabbed with a hand, shocking all the Saints in the surroundings, regardless of those fighting or those observing.

After all, even the Azure Python Great Saint couldn’t face the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon head-on, and it was comparable to the Azure Python or Heavenly Sever Great Saints. But it was immobilized by a dragon’s claw right now.

The Golden-Purple Divine Dragon tried its best to struggle, causing many peaks outside the Sword Sect to crumble. This changed the Light Subduing Great Saint’s face, and his attack on the two Great Saints briefly stopped.

“Come back!” The Light Subduing Great Saint tried to control the Divine Dragon Order to devour the surrounding spiritual energy and break free from the dragon’s claw before soaring to the sky. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Just when Lin Yun and Su Ziyao looked at each other, the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon broke free from the dragon’s claw and bared its fangs at Lin Yun with ferocity flashing in its eyes.

“You’re courting death!” A cold light flashed within Lin Yun’s eyes as he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, gaining control of the Heavenly Dragon’s authority. In the next second, the power of the Azure Dragon’s Grasp became even more powerful, dragging the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon back with golden radiance shining in the palm of the Azure Dragon’s claw.

When the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon was dragged back, the aura of the Heavenly Dragon made the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon tremble in fear. It was too late to escape. The dragon’s claw clenched its fists, crushing the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon’s head.

The Golden-Purple Divine Dragon wasn’t an actual divine dragon but a manifestation. Even so, this scene left everyone dumbfounded.

“Holy shit, the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon was crushed!”

“Isn’t this too unfathomable? The Azure Dragon’s claw crushed a divine dragon!”

“This is weird. The Azure Dragon’s claw was empowered by something else, and the Light Subduing Great Saint was too careless!” Discussions resounded from the surroundings, and the Azure Python Great Saint laughed at this scene.

“That was satisfying! Hahaha!” The Azure Python Great Saint continued to laugh even if it worsened his injuries. He was the old patriarch of the Azure Dragon’s lineage, and there was nothing more satisfying than seeing a Golden-Purple Divine Dragon being crushed before him. He felt that the injuries he suffered were worth it.

The Light Subduing Great Saint’s face changed. He ignored the two Great Saints, pushing them away with a palm before he landed on the ground. At the same time, the Heavenly Sever Great Saint pushed his palms forth and retreated to the Light Subduing Great Saint’s side.

Su Ziyao didn’t follow up with her attack and dismissed the Imperial Dao before retreating. Lin Yun also jumped down from the Azure Dragon, landing on Scarlet Firmament Peak, which excited everyone.

“Ziyao, Fifth Senior Brother, Second Senior Sister, Sect Master...” Lin Yun swept his gaze through everyone and felt complicated before turning to look at the crimson sword ray. His heart finally calmed down since the saint veins weren’t completely severed, and his master’s tribulation wasn’t hindered.

I wasn’t late! When he turned to look at Su Ziyao, he saw the flower crown on her head. He made this on the day of their marriage. He smiled, “You should wear the other crown!”

Su Ziyao smiled, “I prefer this crown you made for me.”

Since their separation in the Fallen God Valley, they had too many things to tell each other. But now wasn’t the moment for them to talk, so they suppressed their emotions.

Su Ziyao looked at Lin Yun, and said, “You can’t abandon me in the future when I declare our relationship in public.”

“I won’t,” Lin Yun replied.

Jian Jingtian coughed unhappily, looking at Lin Yun and Su Ziyao being so affectionate when so many people were around.

“Senior Brother,” Lin Yun smiled and nodded at everyone else.

“Everyone, gather!” The Light Subduing Great Saint raised the Imperial Dragon Order and gave an order to all the Great Saints. The original plan was to slowly destroy the other peaks before going after Scarlet Firmament Peak. Mu Xuankong would be hard to deal with if the other peaks weren't destroyed, but he didn’t expect it to be so troublesome.

However, it was fortunate that they destroyed the majority of the outer peaks and three main peaks. This meant that the Sword Sect lost half of its energy. So the Light Subduing Great Saint decided to summon all the Great Saints to eradicate everyone on Scarlet Firmament Peak.

The Great Saints on Divine, Indigo, and Golden Firmament Peaks stopped their fights and flew to Scarlet Firmament Peak. It didn’t take long before over twenty Great Saints were gathered on Scarlet Firmament Peak. There were four Great Saints who were heavily injured and couldn’t come over.

Ye Guhan and Lil’ Purple exchanged a gaze on Divine Firmament Peak. Lil’ Purple didn’t hesitate to grab Lil’ Red and rushed to Scarlet Firmament Peak. A white-haired old man came out of Divine Firmament Peak. This old man was the Radiant Sword Saint’s junior brother, the Dustlight Great Saint.

“Martial Uncle!” Ye Guhan quickly bowed.

“Go on. I will keep watch here,” the Dustlight Great Saint said.

Ye Guhan heaved a sigh of relief and rushed to Scarlet Firmament Peak. When he landed, the Serene Dust Great Saint, Dragon Origin Great Saint, and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had arrived with a powerful energy rippling from Scarlet Firmament Peak.

The Light Subduing Great Saint’s face was ugly because he initially thought they could easily take down the Sword Sect with so many people. But looking at it carefully, there were Jian Jingtian, Ye Guhan, Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, Serene Dust Great Saint, Dragon Origin Great Saint, the Demon Clan’s Great Saint, and demonic path’s Great Saint, who weren’t weak.

This meant there were seven Great Saints, and Lin Yun and Su Ziyao were equivalent to Great Saints. There were nine with the ability to confront Great Saints. On the other hand, he had twelve Great Saints, and many were injured.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint injured the Netherport Sword Saint and only had half of his strength left, at most. Ye Guhan injured three Great Saints, and the Dragon Origin Great Saint also injured three. This meant they didn’t even have half of the Great Saints in their top condition.

If the Sword Sect was determined to guard Scarlet Firmament Peak, they wouldn’t be able to take it down anytime soon, and both parties would fall into a stalemate. He didn’t include Lil’ Purple, but their advantage would decrease even more if he did.

The Sword Sect’s faction was gathered around Lin Yun with him as the leader.

The Light Subduing Great Saint’s face changed, before he said, “You’re here, and this means that the Sword Sect’s situation has stabilized.”

Lin Yun said nothing, not replying to the Light Subduing Great Saint either.

The Light Subduing Great Saint smiled, “I have a suggestion. If we fight, the Sword Sect will be the one to suffer, and making a move here on Scarlet Firmament Peak would affect the saint vein. Flower Burial, you and the Ninth Princess are married. The Ninth Princess fought the Heavenly Sever Great Saint earlier. If you’re willing to fight me, I can leave Scarlet Firmament Peak with everyone if you defeat me in an even match and will no longer interfere in the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation.”

The moment he said that, the faces of everyone from the Sword Sect changed, while some became playful. They naturally wouldn’t believe in what the Light Subduing Great Saint said. Some scolded the Light Subduing Great Saint for being shameless. After all, a Great Saint who grasped an Eternal Dao wanted to fight Lin Yun.

“What’s the matter? The Ninth Princess dared to fight the Heavenly Sever Great Saint, and yet you don’t even dare to fight me?” The Light Subduing Great Saint smiled. He was trying to taunt Lin Yun.

Jian Jingtian said, “If you leave with everyone now, I can promise not to go after you all in the future. Speaking of which, I have slaughtered everyone in the Profound Sky Sect.”

The faces of all the Great Saints changed when Jian Jingtian said that. What did that mean? Wasn’t that the same as a demonic cultivator? Jian Jingtian was the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, a righteous swordsman. Thus, they couldn’t believe that Jian Jingtian said that.

They were shocked as they looked at Jian Jingtian. A person asked, “What do you mean by slaughtered?”

“Literally. I slaughtered everyone related to the Saints from the Profound Sky Sect who came to attack my Sword Sect, including their disciples and descendants, regardless of their age. As for the two Great Saints remaining in the Profound Sky Sect, they were also slaughtered by me, and I only used ten swords to deal with them,” Jian Jingtian said.

Everyone took a deep breath when they heard that.

Jian Jingtian calmly looked at everyone. He wouldn't pursue it if the three holy lands were willing to leave. After all, the fight between the Divine Phoenix Holy Master and Tian Xuanzi was determined to have an outcome. If the Divine Phoenix Holy Master lost and Tian Xuanzi was alone with no one left, they might be able to fight Tian Xuanzi if everyone attacked him.

Su Ziyao noticed Lin Yun’s right hand was a bone claw, flickering with a metallic gloss. It looked sharp and didn’t hinder the agility of his fingers.

“Your hand...?” Su Ziyao asked.

“It’s nothing,” Lin Yun smiled, holding onto Su Ziyao’s hand. He might not have fully refined the Heavenly Dragon Bone yet, but he could use it as a trump card in critical times since it was half-merged with him.

Looking at the group standing before her, Lil’ Purple said in contempt, “Why are you all acting like a gentleman? Weren’t all of you here to eradicate the Sword Sect and kill the Radiant Sword Saint?”

The Light Subduing Great Saint snorted, “We’ve given you all a chance. You want to force us to kill you all? We’re not the same as this demon. Jian Jingtian, your means won’t frighten me. Let’s cut the crap, and I’m talking to Lin Yun. Do you dare to fight me one-on-one?”

Lin Yun replied, “Sure. But let’s forget about the bet because I won’t leave the Scarlet Firmament Peak even if I’m defeated, and I don’t believe that you will keep your promise even if you lose.”

He received opportunities in the Heavenly Barren Realm and Azure Sky Realm. Before he reached the Saint Sovereign Realm and chose between the sword or eternal, the Iris Sword Saint told him he could confront Great Saints. But now, his cultivation reached the Saint Sovereign Realm, and his eternal daos and sword dao had improved.

Not to mention that the Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix Sword Arts transcended the scope of Dragon Spirit Martial Techniques. Facing the second strongest Great Saint other than Tian Xuanzi, Lin Yun naturally wanted to test his full strength.
