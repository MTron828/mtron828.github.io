Chapter 1992 - Put The Sword Down

This was a middle-aged man wearing purple clothes and had a burly figure. Lin Yun didn’t respond to his crude words, but Bai Qingyu’s face sank. She drew the Stalewater Sword and easily cut through the nirvana aura protecting the middle-aged man.

The inner armor he wore was a saint artifact, but how could it stop the sharpness of the Stalewater Sword? His armor was sliced apart, and Bai Qingyu’s sword sent him flying away. The middle-aged man even suffered an injury to his heart.

The middle-aged man fell to the ground with blood pouring out from his mouth, and his face became pale. But he was fortunate that he was at the Nirvana Stage. He quickly circulated his nirvana aura to his heart to stop his injuries from worsening.

“Where the hell did this dog come from? Get lost!” Bai Qingyu looked at the middle-aged man in disgust. She could’ve taken his life with her attack, but she didn’t have much experience in the outside world, and her murderous intent was lacking. So she ultimately spared his life.

“How dare you hurt someone from our Thunder Eagle Stronghold, are you tired of living?!” The people from a few tables stood up and charged over. When the other cultivators in this hall heard the Thunder Eagle Stronghold’s name, their faces changed because it was a subsidiary force of the Black Mountain Seven Saints.

The Black Mountain Seven Saints were a union between seven saints, and the Whitebone Blade Saint was in the union. Lin Yun killed the Whitebone Blade Saint’s disciple in the past.

The Black Mountain Seven Saints were famous within the Eastern Desolation, and many demonic cultivators became their subsidiaries. The Thunder Eagle Stronghold was one of the forces.

The middle-aged man got up with great difficulty and retreated. He said, “Lord Third, there’s something weird with that lass. Her sword isn’t ordinary!”

The one known as ‘Lord Third’ had a tall figure and bulging muscles. He didn’t reveal his cultivation, but the ominous aura enveloping him was terrifying.

“It’s actually the third master of the Thunder Eagle Stronghold. He’s an expert on the King Ranking!”

“That lass is in trouble now. She has provoked someone she shouldn’t.”

“Hehe, anyone can tell that she came from a proper family. I wonder what she is doing here.”

Reaching the Nirvana Stage was difficult and only possible with a few hundred years of accumulation. There were only about a few hundred thousand Nirvana Stage cultivators. That might sound like a lot, but the Eastern Desolation was massive, with hundreds of millions of cultivators.

So Nirvana Stage cultivators could be considered as the top of the pyramid. But young cultivators at the Nirvana Stage were rare, and even the Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t have many. The King Ranking only picked ten thousand people, and those who could be on the ranking were all at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. Anyone on the King Ranking could quickly deal with three ordinary cultivators at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

After everyone knew that the burly man was Third Master Lei, they all began to sympathize with Bai Qingyu.

“Third Master, we’ll take that lass down for you.” Four people stood up from behind Third Master Lei, all at the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. They circulated their nirvana auras and charged at Bai Qingyu.

The four weren’t weak; they all practiced low-grade ghost spirit martial techniques and executed a fist technique, the Star Annihilation Fist.

Their fist techniques had already reached greater mastery, and their attack power felt like they could destroy stars.

Lin Yun calmly drank his wine while Bai Qingyu swung her sword and severed the hands of the four people. She was invincible when the Stalewater Sword was drawn, and Lin Yun’s face changed because he knew he had to upgrade his Flower Burial Sword.

Screams came from the hall as the four rolled on the ground. This scene made everyone raise their heads to look at Bai Qingyu. Someone already analyzed that Bai Qingyu probably had a huge background and wasn’t someone the Thunder Eagle Stronghold could provoke.

Third Master Lei widened his mouth because he also didn’t expect this scene. As his face changed, his ominous aura disappeared, and he squeezed out a smile, “I apologize for being blind, and I hope this lady can spare us.”

He was humble as he bowed and almost kneeled on the ground.

Bai Qingyu turned to look at Lin Yun as if she was boasting and turned around, “Give me three kowtows, and I’ll spare your life.”

Third Master Lei was decisive, and demonic cultivators like him were used to begging for forgiveness. He immediately went down on his knees and performed a kowtow.

This made Bai Qingyu even smugger, as if she was saying that even a demonic cultivator on the King Ranking was kowtowing to her.

But Lin Yun was focused on drinking and paid no attention to Bai Qingyu. When Third Master Lei finished his three kowtows, he cupped his fists together, “Thank you for sparing my life.”

“Get lost.” Bai Qingyu said, losing her interest in the Third Master Lei.

But right when the Third Master Lei retreated, he smiled and flicked something out from his sleeve. This was a black liquid that shot towards Bai Qingyu.

When Bai Qingyu sensed it, the black liquid penetrated her saint armor and entered her body through her lower abdomen.

“How dare you launch a sneak attack at me!” Bai Qingyu roared. She raised her Stalewater Sword and wanted to charge at the Third Master Lei.

But the Third Master Lei had no fear as he calmly looked at Bai Qingyu.

When Bai Qinyu took two steps out, she fell to the ground, clutching her abdomen with her face distorted by pain. Her face became pale, and her lips gradually became black.

“Haha! This is the blood of the Netherworld Ghost Lesser Dragon. Even a Quasi-Saint wouldn’t be able to resolve it. You’re courting death to dare to injure someone of my Thunder Eagle Stronghold!” Third Master Lei grinned, and he took a step forth. He kicked the Stalewater Sword away before stepping on Bai Qingyu’s hand.

It was naturally painful for Bai Qingyu, but she gritted her teeth and secretly circulated her cultivation technique to purge the venom.

The Third Master Lei naturally noticed this scene but didn’t panic because not even someone at the Quasi-Saint Realm could resolve the venom. He stomped on Bai Qingyu’s hand and sinisterly laughed, “How dare you make me kowtow! I’ll strip you naked and teach you a lesson later!”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The purple-clothed middle-aged man injured by Bai Qingyu earlier also came forth and gave her several kicks. He revealed a lecherous expression and said, “Third Master Lei, this lass is pretty stubborn to keep her mouth shut. Do you want me to train her for you? I’ll guarantee that you can make her scream however you like after that.”

Those from the Thunder Eagle Stronghold laughed lecherously when they heard that.

“Get lost! This lass is a virgin, and I like someone like her!” Third Master Lei laughed and picked up the Stalewater Sword.

The pain nearly made Bai Qingyu tear up, and she felt even more despair. She was shocked to discover that the venom was slowly mixing into her blood, and gradually invading her internal organs.

“This sword…” Third Master Lei’s face changed when he held onto the sword, and his heart beat violently. He immediately felt fortunate that Bai Qingyu didn’t draw her sword, since it was a Glory Saint Artifact. But he immediately rejoiced as he turned to look at Bai Qingyu.

Saint artifacts would transform after reaching ten thousand saint runes. Those with fifty thousand saint runes could be considered a high-grade myriad-rune saint artifact, and those with a hundred thousand saint runes could be compared to a peerless-grade myriad-rune saint artifact.

Even an ordinary Saint Clan only had one or two peerless-grade myriad-rune saint artifacts. A Glory Saint Artifact’s value was comparable to ten peerless-grade myriad-rune saint artifact, and the value was immeasurable. He knew why Bai Qingyu’s attack was so terrifying earlier, but this Glory Saint Artifact now belonged to him.

The more Third Master Lei thought about it, the more excited he became.

“Lin Yun, are you really not going to help her? I feel it’s best that you don’t care about her, but I don’t think you can just watch,” Lil’ Purple said.

“You’re right. I can’t do that.” Lin Yun lowered his cup and removed his bamboo hat. He turned to Third Master Lei and said, “You guys can leave, but put the sword down.”
