Chapter 483 - Heavenly Province Academy

“B-big Sister Siyin, how can you say that to me?” Bai Yi’s face turned red and her voice trembled. She didn’t know how to fight back with her gentle and weak personality.

“Shut it. That brat’s identity is still uncertain. He might be an escaped slave. We still don’t know if we’re in trouble for saving him. Not only that, but you even brought him out instead of notifying me that he’s awake. Can you take responsibility if anything happens?” Lu Siyin reprimanded Bai Yi with strong disapproval. She was unreasonable and shrewd, not giving Bai Yi any chance to fight back.

“Lu Siyin, you’re not allowed to talk like that. Big Brother Lin is surely not a bad person,” said Bai Yi as her face turned red while biting her lips.

“Haha, Bai Yi, didn’t you see the mark on his forehead? It’s common not only in the Nether Providence, but the entire Ancient Southern Domain. That’s the mark of a slave,” said a youth standing beside Lu Siyin. He continued with a sneer, “Brat, am I right?”

Lin Yun fell into deep thought. He now knew why these people were looking at him with disdain earlier. So they saw the mark on his forehead and treated him as a sword slave. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Senior Brother Leng Feng, how can you say that? Even if he’s a sword slave, does it mean that there’s no good people among sword slaves?” argued Bai Yi.

“What do you know? Would he be so injured if he was a good person? You can tell with a glance that someone did it on purpose and tried to cripple him. Sword slave, aren’t I right?” Lu Siyin raised her brow.

“I don’t wish to argue with you about right and wrong. What I want to say is that the sword you’re holding belongs to me,” said Lin Yun.

“What a joke. A sword slave like you can have such a treasured sword? Even if it’s yours, do you think you still have the qualification to possess it? Don’t you know that you’re already a crippled?” sneered Lu Siyin. Even those around her laughed along.

“This sword slave really doesn’t know what’s good for him. We saved his life, but he didn’t even thank us. I would offer the sword to Senior Sister Lu if I was in his position.”

“This sword is extremely valuable. He must’ve stolen it.”

“Of course it’s stolen. Senior Sister Lu is just borrowing it now until she can return it to its true owner in the future,” said the other disciples as they framed Lin Yun for stealing the sword.

“H-how can you guys be like this!” Bai Yi’s face turned red. She never expected that her senior sister would be so shameless.

“Senior Sister Lu, I’m afraid this sword slave still doesn’t know his current situation. Why don’t we lock him up first and make a decision later on after we investigate him?” The disciple named Leng Feng glared at Lin Yun with killing aura flickering in his eyes.

“Sounds good. He’s just a sword slave. He must be courting death to act with such presumptuousness before me,” snorted Lu Siyin.

“Don’t you dare!” Bai Yi stood before Lin Yun anxiously.

“Sorry about this, Junior Sister Bai…” Leng Feng had no intention of sparing his hand. How could he possibly give up this opportunity to get on Lu Siyin’s good side?

“Has the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples fallen so far to act against a heavily injured person?” A lady donned in long purple clothes walked over. Her appearance was more exquisite than Lu Siyin’s and she had rage flashing across her brows. The moment she made her appearance, all the other disciples calmed down, including Lu Siyin.

“Big Brother Lin, you’re going to be alright. This is our Senior Sister, Liu Yunyan. She’s the one who treated your injuries…” Bai Yi smiled the moment she saw the purple-clothed lady.

Lin Yun fell into deep thought. He could tell that this woman was formidable and that she had already reached the Violet Palace Realm. She should be in the initial Yin stage. At the same time, she also revealed that they were disciples of the Heavenly Province Academy.

“Senior Sister…” cried Bai Yi.

Seeing Bai Yi running over, the aloof lady revealed a gentle expression. After listening to her words, she turned to look at Lin Yun. There wasn’t any loathing in her eyes, but at the same time, there wasn’t any friendliness. Nodding her head, she looked at Lu Siyin, “Siyin, is what Lil’ Yi said true? The sword that you’re holding belongs to him?”

“This sword was indeed taken out of the sword box. But that doesn’t mean that it belongs to him. Furthermore, Senior Sister, you already know that he’s crippled, so there’s no way he can use this sword anymore,” said Lu Siyin as she lowered her position.

“You like it?” asked Liu Yunyan as she fell into deep thoughts.

“Yes, Siyin likes this sword. I hope that Senior Sister can indulge me,” said Lu Siyin. She knew that Liu Yunyan would take sides with disciples of the same sect as long as they didn’t take it too far, not to mention that Lin Yun was already a cripple.

“You’re Lin Yun, right?” Liu Yunyan looked at Lin Yun.

“I am.” Lin Yun fell into deep thought. He could tell that they had no intention of handing the sword back.

“I’ll buy your sword,” said Liu Yunyan. “I hope that you can agree.”

“What if I don’t?” Lin Yun said with a playful smile.

Liu Yunyan was surprised. She never expected that Lin Yun dared to speak with her in this manner. But she was someone who wouldn’t get angry so easily. She said calmly, “You might be a sword slave, but you’re talented with your cultivation. But it’s a pity… Perhaps you don’t know, but your injuries are more serious than you imagined. Not only are three of your profound veins crippled, but your seven remaining profound veins are also damaged. You’ll be thrown into pain the moment you circulate your origin energy. It’s impossible for you to treat yourself, so you’re already crippled.”

Liu Yunyan had no choice but to tell Lin Yun the truth. She was the one who treated Lin Yun’s injuries and there was nothing she could do about his profound veins. Even the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples would be crippled if they suffered such heavy injuries.

The Heavenly Province Academy might pay a great price to treat Lin Yun if he was their disciple, but Lin Yun was just a sword slave with no background. So he was destined to be crippled.

“You think that I’m already a crippled and that the Flower Burial Sword no longer has any use for me, so you want to do a favor to your junior sister, right?” Lin Yun instantly knew what Liu Yunyan was trying to do. He never imagined that his seven profound veins would be half-crippled in Liu Yunyan’s eyes, which made things interesting. With the Dracophant Battle Physique, it was just a matter of time before he recovered.

“What if I say that I can recover my cultivation?” asked Lin Yun.

“Is that so? You really know how to tell a joke. I won’t force you if you can recover your cultivation, but let’s talk after your cultivation recovers. The sword will be given to Siyin for now for safekeeping. As compensation, I can give you a place to stay for the time being in the academy.” Liu Yunyan was slightly enraged because she felt that Lin Yun was boasting a little too much.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly inwardly. He had just regained his consciousness and he still had to wait for his injuries to recover in order to make a move. But he didn’t stay on that topic for long and replied, “My interspatial pouch is also with her. Do you think that she should provide safekeeping for that as well?”

Liu Yunyan frowned her brows and looked at Lu Siyin, “What he says is true.”

“It’s true, it is with me, but I didn’t touch any of his stuff. I’m not interested in the interspatial pouch of a sword slave. I’m just keeping it for the time being,” said Lu Siyin as she handed the interspatial pouch over. Thereafter, her eyes lit up and she smiled, “Senior Sister, why don’t we check his interspatial pouch? After all, he might have stolen his owner’s stuff.”

“Cut it out,” reprimanded Liu Yunyan.

“Oh.” Lu Siyin immediately lowered her head. She knew that she had taken it a little too far and had forgotten about her senior sister’s temper.

“Here, you can have it back. I’m not interested in the stuff of a sword slave anyways,” said Lu Siyin as she threw the interspatial pouch over.

Lin Yun took it and glanced at Lu Siyin deeply, “I hope that you remember what you said.”

Lin Yun then turned around and left.

“This fellow, he’s actually holding a grudge. Senior Sister Liu, you’re being too good to him,” said Leng Feng.

“Do I need you to teach me what to do?” Liu Yunyan looked at Leng Feng coldly. Then, she turned to Lu Siyin, “Let me take a look at the sword.”

“Here.” Lu Siyin handed the sword over.

Liu Yunyan pulled the sword out to look at it. The sword was heavy and it had naturally formed spiritual runes. This surprised Liu Yunyan as she looked at the direction Lin Yun left in.

“Flower Burial?” Liu Yunyan now knew why Lu Siyin took a liking to the sword. The sword was indeed a treasure. Sheathing it, Liu Yunyan said, “Return it to him if he recovers his cultivation.”

“You must be joking, Senior Sister. He’s just a piece of trash. Plus, I don’t believe that he can recover,” sneered Lu Siyin. How could she possibly give back something that she already took?
