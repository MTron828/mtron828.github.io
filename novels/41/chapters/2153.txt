Chapter 2154 - Canaan Hall

When the Heavenly Dragon Stage appeared, it instantly captivated everyone’s attention. Those within and outside the Dragon Mountain were focused on the Heavenly Dragon Stage. Even if many people knew that the Heavenly Dragon Stage had nothing to do with them, since they didn’t even have the qualifications to go on it, they still paid attention to it.

After all, the appearance of the Heavenly Dragon Stage would inevitably lead to a reshuffle of the Blue Dragon Record. According to the Saint Elder, those who went up on the Heavenly Dragon Stage would have to give up on their original seat.

So the nine dragon lords also had the qualifications to compete for it. Although they didn’t move now, everyone could tell that they were tempted. The moment someone makes a move, everyone would make a move as well.

Everyone was so excited that they forgot about Tian Gu and Gu Xinyu. This made Lin Yun briefly stunned, and he was thinking about something.

My woman’s women, weren't they still my women?

Ji Zixi asked, “Ye Qingtian, do you want to fight for the Heavenly Dragon Lord?”

“I will,” Lin Yun said without any reservations. Even without Su Ziyao’s words, he would have competed for the Heavenly Dragon Lord. He would be lying to say that he wasn’t interested in the Blue Dragon Record. If it wasn’t for the Dao Yang Holy Son, he would have competed for the Azure Dragon Lord’s position.

If he became the Heavenly Dragon Lord, this meant that he would be ranked first on the Blue Dragon Record. Even if there weren’t any rewards, just this alone was tempting because it would bring great fortune to someone.

“That means I can fight you now to cleanse my regret,” Ji Zixi said seriously.

Shaking his head, Lin Yun said, “No need. You can compete for the other thrones instead. The Heavenly Dragon Lord is too dangerous.”

“Are you looking down on me?” Ji Zixi questioned unhappily.

“Of course not. You have not fully excavated the potential of your phoenix bloodline. Even without the Blue Dragon Record, you will grow into a formidable expert,” Lin Yun said. “But if you join the competition for the Heavenly Dragon Lord, you’ll suffer a disadvantage. The positions of the nine dragon lords will change later, so you might as well go for them instead.”

Ji Zixi was too young, not to mention that she was well-protected by the elders of her clan. As a result, she was severely lacking in terms of fighting experience. She was like a crude jade that required carving. She needed some time to temper herself.

He turned to Bai Shuying and Xin Yan, saying, “You two as well. Fight for a throne if there’s an opportunity.”

Bai Shuying and Xin Yan were slightly weaker to compete for a throne, but they now had an opportunity now that there would be a reshuffle.

Just when everyone was talking, two figures descended from the demonic clouds. Tian Gu and Gu Xinyu then began climbing up the mountain. The moment they landed, they were immediately ganged up on by a group of people.

“How dare you two come up the Dragon Mountain. Everyone, go up and chase them down!”

“Teach them a lesson!”

“Don’t give them the opportunity!” The geniuses from the other holy lands made their moves, unleashing various phenomena that overlapped together. Far away, there were multiple constellations being summoned.

Gu Xinyu and Tian Gu exchanged a gaze, before they both smiled.

“Let’s have a competition and see who can reach the Heavenly Dragon Stage first,” Gu Xinyu said.

“Hahaha! Interesting!” Tian Gu laughed.

They both made a move as various phenomena shattered in the next moment, along with saint aura. They gave off a powerful Quasi-Saint’s aura. Even though everyone there was at the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm, the two of them had grasped multiple saint daos. With one attack, they resolved all the incoming attacks and constellations.

This was a bloody scene. Those who dared to step forth to stop the two of them would be easily defeated by them. They would either have a hole on their chests, their internal organs smashed, or lose their limbs. When they reached halfway up the mountain, the geniuses from the various holy lands came to their senses and could feel a chill down their spines.

They came prepared, and they weren’t weaker than the nine dragon lords with their strength.

“Aren’t they a little too strong?”

“They have grasped at least three saint daos. There’s even a holy son who was sent flying away by Tian Gu before they could even get close.”

“That holy son will be in a coma for at least half a month from the mental attack. In serious cases, this might even become his trauma.”

“Gu Xinyu is also strong. He’s unlike the Blood Moon Divine Son and is walking the path of the physique. His punch earlier had shattered a saint armor.”

“This is a little terrifying. In my eyes, only the Dao Yang Holy Son amongst the nine lords can compete with them.”

“Stop them!”

Everyone came to their senses in this one-sided situation. The Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position wasn’t important now because they had to stop Gu Xinyu and Tian Gu. Even if they couldn’t obtain the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position but became two Divine Dragon Lords, it would be a huge impact. At that time, everyone on the Blue Dragon Record would become a laughingstock.

The faces of the other champions from the various dragon paths changed as their gazes fell onto Tian Gu and Gu Xinyu.

“It's no wonder why you guys forbade us from partaking in the Blue Dragon Record. It turns out that the holy lands’ geniuses are really weak. They’re even weaker than the dogs nurtured by my house. I haven’t even exerted any strength yet, and yet the ground is already dyed red from the blood!” Tian Gu smiled eerily.

At this moment, a genius ranked in the top fifty of the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking soared to the sky and charged at Tian Gu. He didn’t hope to defeat the latter, he just wanted to strike a blow at their momentum.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

But Tian Gu used a bizarre movement technique and he turned into a black light, merging into space and perfectly avoiding the incoming attack. When he reappeared, he snapped his opponent’s spine with a palm, causing the latter to fall off the Dragon Mountain.

Everyone took a deep breath. While they were furious at how ruthless Tian Gu was, they were also shocked by his movement technique. This movement technique involved space dao, and one could use the power of space even if they didn’t grasp Space Dao, which belonged to one of the Eternal Daos.

The two showed more gusto as they fought, one enveloped in silver radiance while the other was enveloped in crimson radiance. As they fought, they looked like two pillars of light from afar, charging to the top of the mountain. It didn’t take long before no one dared to make a move because the outcome of those who lost to them were terrible, not to mention that they couldn’t even touch the corner of Gu Xinyu and Tian Gu’s clothes.

If they lost, they would either be heavily injured or in a coma. In serious cases, they might even be killed. As a result, everyone was terrified of Gu Xinyu and Tian Gu. Even those who were prepared to make a move against the two lost their fighting spirits and had them replaced with endless fear. This made them feel humiliated, but there was nothing they could do about it.

Those who yelled to gang up on those two immediately became silent. This way, they would at least be able to leave their names on the Blue Dragon Record. With that, the inside and outside of the Dragon Mountain became silent.

Many holy lands’ saints hoped that their saint disciples could obtain a better ranking with the appearance of the Heavenly Dragon Stage, but they were bloodbathed as a result. There wasn’t anyone left standing in the path of Gu Xinyu and Tian Gu.

No one expected this scene. They thought that even if the two were strong, they could easily take them down by relying on numbers.

Tian Gu soon reached the Dragon’s Claw position. He swept his gaze at the few hundred on the Dragon’s Claw, and laughed, “Bring me a challenge. Otherwise, it’s too easy for me to reach the Heavenly Dragon Stage this way. Anyone on the Dragon’s Claw dare to fight me?”

He was close to the Heavenly Dragon Stage, and he could dash over if he wanted. But he stopped on purpose to provoke the geniuses on the Dragon’s Claw.

“Let me fight you.” On the Dragon’s Claw, the holy son of the Canaan Hall stepped forth. He was young, and pointed at Tian Gu, “A monster like you wants to challenge the Heavenly Dragon Stage? Let me face you!”

The Canaan Hall’s holy son was ranked nineteenth on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking, and he was at the level of those on the dragon’s heads. He lost to Gu Xinyan in a fight and lost the chance to compete for the Blue Dragon Lord’s position. As a result, he could only retreat to the Dragon’s Claw. If it was another Divine Dragon Path, he was capable of putting up a challenge for the spot.

Seeing the Canaan Hall’s holy son standing out, everyone on the Dragon Mountain heaved a sigh of relief.

“With the Canaan Hall’s holy son making a move, there’s finally someone to teach Tian Gu a lesson. Did that demon really think that he’s invincible?”

“The Canaan Hall has a long inheritance and has existed since ancient times. They’re mysterious, and I heard that they have a secret technique to deal with the Demonspirit Clan.”

“Looks like there will be an interesting battle.” Everyone held high hopes for the Canaan Hall’s holy son.

The Canaan Hall’s holy son released a dazzling golden holy radiance with ancient scriptures appearing around him, looking dignified.

Under the golden radiance, the demonic aura around Tian Gu began to sizzle as though it was being purified. This naturally made Tian Gu squint, and he said, “The Canaan Scripture? So it really exists. I thought it was a legend because many from the royal clan were suppressed by it back then.”

“It’s good that you know of it,” the Canaan Hall’s holy son said.

Tian Gu’s face became grave, and said, “If I’m not wrong, you must have fused a Canaan Saint Bone into yourself.”

The Canaan Hall’s holy son was surprised to hear that because Tian Gu knew too much. He didn’t want to reveal too much so he attacked with the Canaan Saint Finger, “Cut the crap and die!”

In the next second, an ancient buddha appeared ten miles away from the Canaan Hall’s holy son, pointing his finger over. As a golden beam traveled across ten miles, the surrounding space began to crack when it approached Tian Gu.

The Canaan Hall’s holy son squinted because Tian Gu wouldn’t be able to use his bizarre movement technique this way.

“Great Roc Wings!” Canaan Hall’s holy son spread his arms apart, charging at Tian Gu before the golden beam reached him.
