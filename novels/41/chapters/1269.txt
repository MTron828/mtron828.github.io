Chapter 1270 - Massacre (2)

“One of you against the eight of us? Do you really think of yourself as a transcendent genius from a powerful sect?” The armored woman began to sneer as a flaming bird appeared behind her. The flaming bird was a phoenix sparrow, which possessed the bloodline of a phoenix. They were also called sacred birds.

That was her constellation. When she brought out her constellation, she was the first to attack. As she put her hands together, the phoenix sparrow behind her began to flap its wings, unleashing countless meteorite flames toward Lin Yun.

“Pitiful tricks.” The azure dragon coiled around Lin Yun charged at the meteorites and instantly sent them flying. In the next second, Lin Yun appeared before the armored woman and thrust his palm forth.

When he thrust his palm, it was like a dragon claw that was enveloped in wind and lightning. Lin Yun wanted to use these people to advertise his name to everyone. To do that, he wanted to face the eight of them all alone and suppress all eight of them.

When the armored woman saw Lin Yun charging over, she didn’t panic and took out two blades; both blades were saint artifacts. As she swung her blades, two flaming moons suddenly appeared in the sky.

Facing her attack, a golden crow and silver phoenix flew from Lin Yun’s body. He had quickly brought out his holy spirit martial technique, the Divine Solar Lunar Fist, to destroy the flame moons unleashed by the armored woman.

But his attack didn’t stop after destroying the flame moons and even made the armored woman spew blood from her mouth. At this moment, Lin Yun was enveloped in a purple and golden light with his hair fluttering wildly in the wind. Aside from his sword intent, he had practically gone all out because he wanted to test how strong he had become after cultivating within the Nine Li Illusion Realm.

“Who the hell are you?” asked the silver-haired man.

“Lin Yun. Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s Lin Yun,” replied Lin Yun while swinging his arm backward, sending a person who was trying to launch a sneak attack at his back flying. The one sent flying away was a purple-clothed man from the Azure Thunder Sect, and that slap had instantly caused half of his face to swell. Even the flames and lightning around him were forcibly dispersed from Lin Yun’s slap.

“Charge!” Seeing that Lin Yun was so strong, the eight geniuses no longer held back.

“Good!” Fighting spirits also blazed in Lin Yun’s pupils, seeing the eight of them charging over. He could sense the pressure and danger coming from the eight of them. This was the first time he had encountered someone like them since leaving the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, so he couldn’t help being excited with his blood boiling.

“How arrogant! Do you think you can suppress all eight of us by yourself?” Luo Kun became even more ferocious despite his injuries. His three-meter body was like a fearless bull at this moment.

The other geniuses also didn’t hesitate to bring out their trump cards without any hesitation. As an azure moon flew over, the man who was sent flying with a slap earlier summoned a saint sword before charging over.

When Lin Yun saw that he was trying to attack him with a sword, he stepped forth and caused lightning to rumble beneath his feet with every single step. The sudden outburst of the thunderstorm sent Luo Kun flying away before Lin Yun reached out and tapped the sword of the Azure Thunder Sect’s disciple.

This instantly caused the sword to explode with a great light and leave the purple-clothed man in shock. He was shocked to discover that his sword was actually beginning to tremble and the saint runes on the sword also showed signs of collapsing.

Looking at this scene, Gongsun Yan, who was hiding, nearly cursed out loud. He had no idea when Lin Yun became so strong that he could nearly destroy the saint runes on the sword with just his fingers.

“You’re courting death!” The purple-clothed man was briefly stumped before he drew his sword back. As the sword light began to surge around him, it formed into an azure moon above his head. With his attack resonating with the azure moon, his sword aura was brought to an even more terrifying height.

“Heaven and Earth Unite!” The two holy spirits summoned by Lin Yun manifested into the heavens and earth, before he clenched his fists threw them forth. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

His attack instantly shattered the sword aura that the purple-clothed man had just formed, and when the shockwave rippled, it actually stopped the other seven geniuses from approaching him. Listening to the rumbling collision, the faces of the eight geniuses become ugly because they realized that they couldn’t obtain the upper hand in this fight, even with the eight of them ganging up on Lin Yun, and this was simply too unbelievable.

“Die!” Right at that moment, the armored woman merged with the phoenix sparrow behind her and she turned into a genuine phoenix sparrow. The flames blazing on the phoenix sparrow were so strong that they even caused the entire sky to turn red, making it look as if the sky was burning.

“The secret technique of the Flame Phoenix Sect!” Gongsun Yan and Zhao Yan, who were hiding, were both shocked when they saw this scene. They instantly recognized it being a secret technique of the Flame Phoenix Sect. It was an extremely overbearing secret technique. Once brought out, it could even inflict heavy injuries on a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert. As for those who were only at the Lesser Elysium Core Realm, they could only be instantly reduced to ashes.

The threat made Lin Yun’s heart beat, but he didn’t panic. The golden demonic astral flowers within his body circulated at the same time as boundless astral energy exploded forth and even caused the surrounding space to distort. This was the power after reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. He could use this move to devour the spiritual energy within the surroundings to strengthen himself and cause the surrounding space to distort.

But in the eyes of others, they could only see that just when the phoenix sparrow was about to devour Lin Yun, it was suddenly stopped by an invisible wall. Taking the opportunity from this moment, dragon runes gathered into Lin Yun’s palm and he reached out, grabbing onto the armored woman’s throat.

This made the phoenix sparrow let out a cry before it disappeared and returned to the armored woman with her face turning red, unable to breathe. The armored woman had fear written all over her face as she begged for mercy, “I…I lost.”

But the moment Lin Yun let go of her throat, she suddenly opened her mouth and spat out golden flames at Lin Yun’s face. “Go and die!”

The armored woman’s face was cold and indifferent. This was her innate flames that could even melt ordinary saint artifacts.

But an unbelievable scene took place. Lin Yun opened his mouth and swallowed the golden flames. As the golden flames blazed within Lin Yun’s body, the flames blazed his internal organs and coursed through his meridians, causing him to start glowing.

“You…” The armored woman was dumbfounded by this scene. It was as if Lin Yun’s physique alone was a terrifying saint artifact. Not only did her innate flame fail to injure Lin Yun, but it was even helping Lin Yun temper his body.

“You demon! Return my innate flames!” The armored woman finally lost it and charged toward Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun merely gave her a slap. As blood splattered out, a headless corpse fell before his feet.

“Time to end this.” Lin Yun had flames coursing throughout his body, and the flames tempering his internal organs were also causing him great pain at the same time. He was truly angered by the woman at that moment and looked at the remaining seven with a killing aura brimming in his eyes.

“Tonight, none of you are allowed to leave!” Lin Yun’s cold words resounded.
