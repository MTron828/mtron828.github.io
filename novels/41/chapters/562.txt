Chapter 563 - Ferocious Battle

“The Heavenly Province Academy’s Liu Yunyan wins!” The elder’s voice sounded out once more, which made everyone fall into silence as they waited to see who would fight next.

Liu Yunyan and Zhou Qin’s battle was rather interesting, especially with the way that Liu Yunyan turned the tables around with her sword technique and spiritual runes. With that, all the pressure was now on the Azurefoot Academy.

“Lin Yun, the Azurefoot Academy will most likely send Jiang Yi out,” said Mo Ling as she looked at Lin Yun. Jiang Yi was someone ranked among the top ten in the Cloud Trigram Sect’s inner disciples.

All the overlord forces had a deep foundation, so their inner disciples were basically the same as a core disciple. Additionally, Jiang Yi was ranked among the top ten, so everyone from the Heavenly Province Academy turned to look at Lin Yun with a grave expression. Originally, Jiang Yi was supposed to be handled by Mu Xue. After all, they both belonged to overlord forces.

Lin Yun could sense the surrounding gazes and he could tell that they weren’t optimistic. After all, his opponent was Jiang Yi. But Lin Yun didn’t say anything about it. He would just let his strength prove that he wasn’t inferior to the overlord forces’ elites.

“I hope that you have the strength to back up your words. It would be best if I’m not needed.” Mu Xue looked at Lin Yun. She wasn’t optimistic about Lin Yun, so it would be a surprise if he won.

“It’s time,” said Mo Ling.

Lin Yun nodded his head as he soared into the sky and landed on the stage. When he raised his head, he could see Jiang Yi landed on the stage as well.

Lin Yun’s appearance had caused a commotion in the surrounding area as everyone looked at him.

“Who is he? He doesn’t look to be from the city nor from one of the overlord forces.”

“Is he the Heavenly Province Academy’s helper? Isn’t he a little too weak? He’s not even in the Yang stage. How can he possibly fight with Jiang Yi? Is the Heavenly Province Academy giving up?”

“He’s probably here as cannon fodder. That would leave Mu Xue as the trump card. Looks like this will be a boring battle.” The surrounding whispers entered Lin Yun’s ears, but there were no changes to his face.

“Cloud Trigram Sect, Jiang Yi,” smiled Jiang Yi as he introduced himself.

“Lin Yun,” said Lin Yun indifferently.

“Lin Yun? I’ve heard of you.” Jiang Yi’s words attracted Lin Yun’s attention as Jiang Yi smiled, “The grace of the Flower Burial, Lin Yun. Someone told me about you in the Cloud Trigram Sect. His evaluation of you is rather high. After all, you defeated him in the Dragon Gate Competition.”

“Who is it?” Lin Yun asked.

“I can’t tell you for now. I can only say that he joined us for barely three months and has shown unbelievable talent. He can be considered my junior brother. I believe you two will meet again at the Draconic Banquet,” smiled Jiang Yi.

Someone I defeated? Bai Lixuan or Zuo Yun? Or maybe it’s Situ Xueyi?

“Don’t bother thinking and pay attention to our fight instead. As you’ve seen, I’m going to give it my all in this fight. I’m not going to treat you as an easy opponent,” smiled Jiang Yi as his eyes flashed with a domineering aura. He was unleashing the Primal Chaos Art. Jiang Yi’s origin energy began to surge on the stage, which produced a rumbling noise.

Lin Yun also circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and filled his body with his origin energy. Everyone could sense the sparks coming from Lin Yun and Jiang Yi’s eyes. With that, a tense atmosphere quickly spread out and caused the surrounding spectators to stay silent.

When Lin Yun and Jiang Yi’s aura both reached the peak, Jiang Yi stopped smiling. His eyes flickered coldly and he stomped his foot on the ground. Cracks quickly appeared on the ground and he disappeared before everyone’s eyes.

Lin Yun had spread his sword aura around him. He was using his xiantian sword intent to increase his senses. Without warning, Lin Yun tilted his body and he threw his palm out. His palm was filled with his silver origin energy that exploded and forced a figure backwards.

Everyone was shocked by Lin Yun’s reaction speed and they no longer look down on him anymore. They could tell how strong Lin Yun was from how quickly he reacted. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Not fast enough,” smiled Jiang Yi as he reached out with his right hand. Before Lin Yun could take his fist back, Jiang Yi grabbed onto Lin Yun’s fist and held it firmly before twisting his body. If Jiang Yi got his way, then Lin Yun would be thrown out and he might even lose the fight.

No one had expected that the battle between the two would be so perilous. But before Jiang Yi could exert his force, Lin Yun suddenly released his right hand and counter gripped Jiang Yi’s wrist.

With that, they both held onto each other’s wrists as they exerted their force at once, pouring their origin energy into their arms. Their powers were like two ancient beasts clashing at each other.

With that, the two of them fell into a stalemate as they rolled violently in mid-air. All of a sudden, a violent wind swept through the stage with rumbling explosions as the two held onto each other.

“This…” Everyone was shocked by this scene. The two of them were too overbearing.

But the stalemate didn’t last for long since Jiang Yi held the upper hand due to his cultivation. As Jiang Yi released his origin energy, he threw Lin Yun out, which caused Lin Yun to fall towards the ground.

However, Lin Yun landed on his feet firmly, which left many people shocked. They were shocked by how Lin Yun countered the force without causing a crater to form on the ground.

But before their shock lasted any longer, two explosions sounded out as Jiang Yi and Lin Yun charged towards each other once again. They both began to fight in mid-air and Jiang Yi stabbed his fingers towards the center of Lin Yun’s brows.

Lin Yun maintained his composure as he threw a punch Jiang Yi’s stabbing fingers. The ferocious power instantly caused a huge explosion as Lin Yun dissolved Jiang Yi’s attack. At the same time, Lin Yun’s palm hacked at Jiang Yi’s neck.

This made Jiang Yi’s face change as he bent his arm to block the attack. When Lin Yun’s attack landed on his arm, it caused another rumbling explosion. Then, they both made use of the momentum to start spinning in mid-air.

When they stopped spinning, Lin Yun and Jiang Yi’s eyes both flashed with a cold light as they kicked at each other’s head. If one of them was slower, then their head would explode. The danger of this fight made beads of sweat fall from the spectators’ foreheads.

When the kicks landed, Lin Yun and Jiang Yi’s lips twitched as they turned into countless afterimages that clashed in mid-air. The ferocity of this battle made the battle between Liu Yunyan and Zhou Qin look like child’s play.

The spectators couldn’t help praising the fighters. Lin Yun and Jiang Yi were using all their strength to target their opponent’s lethal spots. This battle also proved that they both had ample experience in fighting.

No one had expected Lin Yun to unleash such strength since they weren’t optimistic about him initially. But now, Lin Yun had proved them all wrong by fighting Jiang Yi to a stalemate.

Even Mu Xue, who wanted to see Lin Yun turn into a joke, had turned pale. She knew that she couldn’t be this brutal if she was the one on stage. Just thinking about it made her feel a chill run down her spine.
