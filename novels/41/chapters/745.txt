Chapter 746 - Monstrous Geniuses

Looking at the figures standing on the city wall, Lin Yun maintained his composure. But the cultivators in the city were dumbfounded and began to cheer.

They hadn’t heard any news about so many monstrous geniuses coming to Swordmire City, so they couldn’t help being surprised seeing many of them here. Then again, it wouldn’t be weird for many of the geniuses to fight against a beast tide of this size.

This was a disaster to commoners, but to monstrous geniuses, this was the best chance they had to temper themselves. Normally, even if they went to the most dangerous mountain range, they wouldn’t have an opportunity like this to slaughter many demonic beasts.

“There are so many people here. That’s the Profound Yang Palace’s Chief Disciple, Qin Yang, who’s ranked twenty-three on the Dragoncloud Ranking. I heard that he had reached the eleventh stage in the Profound Yang Art.”

“Zhao Feng from the Indigothunder Sect has come. He was ranked in the top thirty on the previous Dragoncloud Ranking.”

“The Azurewood Pavilion’s Xie Yu is also here. He’s another genius in the top thirty. Back then, he shocked many people and many seniors had a deep impression of him.”

“......”

There were many geniuses present, but the most brilliant ones were Qin Yang, Zhao Feng, and Xie Yu. After all, they were in the top thirty on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

The inner Dragoncloud Ranking had two levels, the top ten and those not in the top ten. As for those on the outer ranking, no one really paid much attention to them. These two levels had a huge gulf that couldn’t be crossed.

If a genius ranked eleventh faced another who was ranked tenth, he or she would be defeated within twenty moves. But if the genius ranked tenth faced the genius ranked ninth, the gap wouldn’t be that great. This logic also applied for those in the top thirty and outside of the top ten.

“And here I thought I could meet many experts in Swordmire City. What a disappointment.” Xie Yue, who was only twenty, smiled as he glanced at the geniuses gathered in Swordmire City. His smile was warm, but his eyes flickered with disdain.

Qin Yang smiled, “It’s a false notion that there are seven main cities in the Thunder Prefecture. The real geniuses are all gathered at the Thunder Prefectural City. When they get here, the beast tide will reach the climax.”

These words were piercing for the other geniuses to hear. Although the faces of the cultivators in Swordmire City were ugly, none of them dared to refute those words. Just a moment ago, they were discussing how Lin Yun slaughtered Skymound City’s seven geniuses. However, that was nothing compared to the three newcomers. The geniuses in the top thirty could probably crush the seven geniuses with a single finger.

These people were too powerful. They shined brightly in the Draconic Banquet four years ago, so they were even more powerful now.

Zhao Feng spoke out, “It doesn’t matter if they don’t come. We’ll ultimately meet at the Draconic Banquet. We should focus just in case the three kings and seven geniuses show up.”

The moment he said that, the smile on Qin Yang and Xie Yu’s faces disappeared as they retracted their aura. They no longer had the confidence from before. They might be monstrous geniuses in the eyes of others, but they weren’t on the same level as the three kings and seven geniuses.

It had been a long time since they showed up in the Ancient Southern Domain, and not many people could track them. They were like geniuses looming above everyone’s heads, especially the three kings. Four years ago, they were so powerful that others could only despair when facing them. So they couldn’t imagine how strong they had become after four years.

As for the other geniuses, their faces were ugly as their aura was only slightly weaker than Qin Yang, Zhao Feng, and Xie Yu. But deep in their hearts, they weren’t that convinced by the strength of those in the top thirty. In fact, they even wanted to replace them on the Draconic Banquet. However, when it came to the three kings and seven elites, they could only feel helpless against those ten legends.

There were rumors that the ten of them had left the Ancient Southern Domain to travel around. Unlike Qin Yang, Xie Yu, and Zhao Feng, the geniuses in Swordmire CIty had never even met the three kings and seven elites before. But the reputation of those ten absolute geniuses had been passed down from the senior brothers in their sects who witnessed the prestige of the three kings and seven elites.

Although they left the Ancient Southern Domain a while ago, their reputation was still high. So the local geniuses couldn’t imagine what kind of ripples they would cause when they returned.

When Lin Yun heard this, he was also shocked. He heard stories of the three kings and seven elites’ reputation, but he never expected that simply mentioning those names would cause all the geniuses to act humble and retract their aura. This was simply unbelievable to him.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with surprise as he turned around to look at the sky. There were two figures under the demonic clouds whose sword intent radiated brightly, especially the person on the left. His sword intent gave off a feeling that it could even shatter the demonic clouds.

“Wu Xiaotian!” The faces of the geniuses on the city wall changed at this scene. Bloodwar Pavilion, Wu Xiaotian. He was ranked seventeenth in the previous Dragoncloud Ranking and nearly entered the top ten. Unfortunately, he couldn’t cross the huge gulf.

At the previous Draconic Banquet, this person was ruthless and killed many people before he was defeated by Jiang Ziye of the seven elites. Otherwise, he would definitely be able to make it into the top ten.

“A ruthless one came,” smiled Xie Yu with narrowed eyes. Although Xie Yu was smiling, his gaze had become grave. During the last Draconic Banquet, he was only sixteen when he witnessed Wu Xiaotian’s ruthlessness. Even he had to admit that Wu Xiaotian was stronger than him. But things were different now that four years had passed.

Even Zhao Feng wore a dark expression as he was defeated by this person four years ago.

When the two figures flew over and landed on the city gate, Lin Yun recognized the person on the right. It was Ji Wuye. He recalled that Ji Wuye was from the Bloodwar Pavilion, but he didn’t expect that Ji Wuye would have such a terrifying senior brother.

After looking at Wu Xiaotian, Lin Yun began to examine Ji Wuye. It had been half a year since they last met at the Withernorth Sea. It appeared that Ji Wuye had become a lot stronger in just six months, and the bloodlust coming from him wasn’t inferior to his senior brother.

Interesting… It would be boring if Ji Wuye made no progress over the past six months. Lin Yun was happy that Ji Wuye didn’t fall due to his defeat.

Ji Wuye seemed to have noticed his gaze as Lin Yun smiled before he left quietly. Geniuses were keen to detect aura, not to mention a killing aura directed at him.

Ji Wuye then glanced in Lin Yun’s direction and saw a vague smile. He was surprised as he couldn’t verify the identity of the person who had looked at him, “Is that him?”

“Who did you see?” Wu Xiaotian asked in a hoarse voice that sounded cold.

“He seems to be the one who defeated me back in the empyrean’s tomb.” Ji Wuye replied, but he wasn’t sure about his guess.

“I’ll help you kill him,” said Wu Xiaotian as if he was saying something insignificant.

“No need. I’ll deal with him personally in the Draconic Banquet,” said Ji Wuye as he shook his head.

“Very well. I won’t help you since you said that. You have to kill him yourself to nourish your bloodlust and sword. If you agree, I won’t kill him, but you instead,” said Wu Xiaotian with a weird smile.

Ji Wuye didn’t reply to Wu Xiaotian because he wasn’t surprised by the bizarre personality of his senior brother. The two chatted with each other when they landed on the city gate. They didn’t bother with anyone else as their bloodlust made others feel uncomfortable.

The Bloodwar Pavilion might be a sect, but all of them were demonic cultivators who took joy in killing. They might be powerful, but no one liked them. On the city wall, only Qin Yang, Xie Yu, and Zhao Feng weren’t afraid of Wu Xiaotian and Ji Wuye’s bloodlust as they unleashed their aura to compete with them.

“Wu Xiaotian, I never thought I would see you here. I thought you would have gone insane by now,” smiled Qin Yang. Back then, when Wu Xiaotian was defeated by Jiang Ziye, he suffered a huge blow. Demonic cultivators generally had a twisted personality and they would go insane if they weren’t careful.

Four years ago, Wu Xiaotian swept through many geniuses before he ran into Jiang Ziye. When he was defeated, he acted like a madman asking for Jiang Ziye to kill him. But Jiang Ziye didn’t even take a glance at him. As the only female among the seven elites, Jiang Ziye was also extremely ruthless.

There were rumors that Wu Xiaotian went insane after the Draconic Banquet and began to wander around like a beggar before he was found by the seniors of his sect and imprisoned. So it was surprising yet not surprising that he would appear.

Wu Xiaotian glanced at Qin Yang before he ignored the latter. This made the hearts of Qin Yang, Zhao Feng, and Xie Yu’s hearts sink as Wu Xiaotian probably became even stronger than before.

“Wu Xiaotian, you better hope you don’t run into me in this Draconic Banquet,” said Zhao Feng as he looked at Wu Xiaotian coldly. Clearly, he still held a grudge regarding his defeat four years ago.

Ji Wuye glanced at Zhao Feng before he said, “You want to defeat my senior brother? My senior brother is here to kill the Beast King. I bet you don’t even have the courage to face the Beast King.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Beast King was comparable to the Heavenly Soul Realm. When Qin Yang, Xie Yu, and Zhao Feng heard that, they took a cold breath.

Wu Xiaotian looked around before he mocked, “Let’s disperse. The demonic beasts are only probing and all of you fell for it. What a joke. I saw the demonic beasts wailing a hundred miles away from here. Are you guys going to yell back in response? Junior brother, let’s go.”

Ji Wuye and Wu Xiaotian then left the city wall, leaving behind a bunch of geniuses whose faces had turned ugly.
