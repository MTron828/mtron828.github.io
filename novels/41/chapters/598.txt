Chapter 599 - Reaching Yang Stage

Lin Yun’s plan was to get the Profound Yin Water to make a breakthrough. His Iris Sword Sutra had reached the tenth stage, so he was able to make a breakthrough ever since he refined the Infernal Flower’s petal.

Since he had obtained the Profound Yin Water now, there was no reason for him not to refine it. After all, strength was of utmost importance in the Withernorth Sea. It didn’t matter if he was trying to protect himself or compete for the empyrean’s tomb, he needed strength.

His previous meeting with Yang Fan and Guo Xu had given him a clear understanding of the strength of those elites on the ranking. They were only ranked in the sixties and seventies, but they were already so powerful. Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how strong those in the top ten would be.

If there was a huge gap between their cultivation and Lin Yun didn’t use his complete mastery of xiantian sword intent, he would probably be defeated with just one move. There was no doubt that both Ji Wuye and Yan Kong had immense strength. Therefore, he had to take this opportunity to make his breakthrough.

Closing his eyes, Lin Yun sat down and slowly closed his eyes. As he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra within his body, he began to emit a silver glow and his sword intent was released. At the same time, Lin Yun’s hair began to flutter in the wind as the jade bottle containing the Profound Yin Water hovered in front of him.

Suddenly, the jade bottle shattered and the Profound Yin Water turned into droplets of liquid hovering before him. But Lin Yun wasn’t in a rush to refine them as he first used his sword intent to purify the Profound Yin Water. After all, the underground palace was heavily corroded by demonic aura, so Lin Yun had to be sure that the Profound Yin Water was pure.

He had always been a cautious person, so he wouldn’t make such a simple mistake. But a brief moment later, the Profound Yin Water started glittering like pearls as they emitted a green glow. After Lin Yun was done purifying the demonic aura, Lin Yun opened his eyes and swallowed the Profound Yin Water.

The droplets of water turned into a stream that entered his mouth, Lin Yun’s aura also began to rise. His clothes began to flutter and his aura approached the Yang stage. In the next second, the Profound Yin Water entering Lin Yun’s body spread throughout his body. He could feel every cell swelling, but there weren't many changes to his body.

Even with his powerful physique, he still felt a faint aching all over his body. At the same time, the overflow of origin energy also caused his violet palace to begin to swell.

Booming sounds constantly came from his body and in the next second, muscles began to grow on Lin Yun’s lean body, which puffed up his clothes. The changes were unprecedented. This was also the reason why the Profound Yin Water was so rare and could only be found in overlord forces.

When his physique reached its limit, the Profound Yin Water absorbed the silver sword energy within his body. It was like a sponge in the way that it soaked everything up.

A brief moment later, Lin Yun’s origin energy became more refined and was purer than before. As Lin Yun continued to circulate the Iris Sword Sutra, the swelling sensation within his body gradually calmed down.

After Lin Yun completed one cycle of the Iris Sword Sutra, the silver glow around his body gradually calmed down. At this moment, Lin Yun was like a growing lotus.

Making a breakthrough from the Yin stage to Yang stage was smoother than he had imagined. In the past, every single of Lin Yun’s breakthroughs had caused a huge commotion along with an outburst of aura. It had never been so calm like this. It felt like making a breakthrough to the Yang stage was just a small matter.

Two hours later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and let out a long breath. His aura has undergone a complete change. When he slowly got up on his feet, aside from his tattered clothes, there weren't many changes to him. But if someone examined him carefully, they would see that Lin Yun had grown in height and his explosive muscles became smoother. He had clearly become more muscular, but now he looked like a sculpted piece of jade.

“Interesting… The Profound Yin Water can actually affect my heart,” said Lin Yun as he looked at his right hand with surprise. He had refined many pellets and herbs in the past, but this was the first time he had such a bizarre feeling.

The breakthrough was unbelievably smooth, but the changes brought to him by the Profound Yin Water were unreal. As Lin Yun released his aura in the lesser Yang stage, his silver origin energy now had some warmth compared to when he was in the Yin stage.

This had brought a complete transformation to his origin energy, and Lin Yun could sense that this breakthrough had made him stronger by at least 50%. The improvement was shocking.

Suddenly, Lin Yun punched the ground and a huge crater reaching a hundred meters deep and nearly a thousand meters wide appeared. The huge crater had left Lin Yun shocked by his current strength, but at the same time, his pupils were filled with excitement.

“I’ve really underestimated the Profound Yin Water’s usage. My strength has increased by at least 70% to 80%. Right now, even without using my xiantian sword intent, I can probably compete with Guo Xu just by relying on my origin energy,” muttered Lin Yun with satisfaction filled in his eyes.

After Lin Yun changed into a new set of clean clothes, he soared into the sky and left this place. But suddenly, Lin Yun ran into a horrible natural disaster, but he was used to it since this was the Withernorth Sea.

As he executed the Seven Profound Steps, the Golden Crow Seal appeared behind him and shot out like a bolt of lightning. When he charged out of the sandstorm, Lin Yun spread his arms apart and landed on a sand dune.

Beneath the sand dune was empty flat land and there was a ferocious battle ongoing with three sect’s disciples donned in crimson clothes attacking a youth. The youth had defined features and his strength was impressive. But he was ultimately overwhelmed and he was already covered with injuries.

The three ganging up on him were experienced, especially the crimson clothed youth taking the lead. Whenever the lone youth was exhausted from his two foes, the leader would suddenly strike out like a viper. Every time he attacked, he would bite a piece of flesh off the youth.

“You’re a genius from the Heavenly Sword Sect? You don’t seem that impressive at all…” said the crimson clothed youth with a smirk. The youth was Mu Chen, who was ranked as a top three inner disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect. He was a genius who reached the greater Yang stage at the age of eighteen.

“The world is really small…” Lin Yun muttered as he watched this scene. Then again, it wasn’t entirely a coincidence. The Withernorth Sea might be massive, but if they continued to go deep in the desert, they would run into each other sooner or later.

Mu Chen came with the intention of spreading his name in the Withernorth Sea, but he was now in terrible straits and his life was in danger. As for the leader dressed in crimson clothes, he was naturally a core disciple in the Bloodwar Pavilion. If Lin Yun had guessed correctly, they should be the ones standing beside Ji Wuye.

“How shameless! If you, Chen Hou, didn’t launch a sneak attack and gang up on me, pieces of trash like you wouldn’t be able to defeat me. Even if you kill me today, my senior brother will take revenge for me!” Mu Chen cursed with a grim expression. He had found a rare fruit with great difficulty, but before he could pluck the fruit, Chen Hou suddenly launched a sneak attack on him. Then, they surrounded him before he could even react.

Mu Chen initially thought that he could survive by giving them the fruit, but he didn’t expect that they had no intention of letting him off.

Chen Hou mocked, “You call yourself a genius when you can’t even fight with multiple opponents? As for your trash Senior Brother Zhang Yuan, he’s nothing before my senior brother. Hahaha!”

As Chen Hou laughed, his palm landed on Mu Chen’s chest once more. This time, Mu Chen’s bones broke as he threw up a mouthful of blood and was sent flying. He had even lost control of the sword in his hand.

“So what if you’re a disciple of an overlord force? You’ll still die running into me, Chen Hou!” Chen Hou wore a sinister expression as he threw a palm at Mu Chen’s head. If this palm connected, Mu Chen would definitely lose his life.

But right in the crucial moment, a golden light exploded as an azure figure descended and blocked the palm. This caused blood to leak out from Chen Hou’s lips as he took several steps back. Even the other two disciples from the Bloodwar Pavilion’s faces had changed as they gathered behind Chen Hou.

“Lin Yun?” Mu Chen was shocked to see Lin Yun. He never imagined that Lin Yun would come to his rescue, but he couldn’t be bothered thinking about that right now. Lin Yun might be hateful, but at least he wouldn’t die now with the two of them working together.

“Another one coming to die?” Chen Hou soon calmed himself down when he realized that Lin Yun was only in the lesser Yang stage.

“What ignorance despite facing death,” sneered Lin Yun as he picked up Mu Chen’s sword. The moment he held onto it, he could tell that this sword wasn’t ordinary. But due to his unique physique, there was no way this sword could allow him to strike twice. But dealing with these clowns before him, one attack was more than enough.

“Lin Yun, don’t be impulsive. He’s Ji Wuye’s junior brother. We have to work together to survive.” Mu Chen was startled when he saw Lin Yun wanting to charge over with his sword. He instantly knew that they were both going to die.

“What arrogance!”

“Hehe, another one that’s so arrogant.”

“Let me see what you can do to me!” The three disciples from the Bloodwar Pavilion sneered as they charged towards Lin Yun.

“Die!” Lin Yun merely reacted by taking a step forward and swinging his sword. In the next second, his sword energy empowered by his xiantian sword intent limited at greater mastery dyed the entire world silver as a powerful sword aura destroyed the three disciples’ auras.

When the silver ray flashed, a thousand meter long ravine appeared behind the three disciples from the Bloodwar Pavilion. In the next second, the sword in Lin Yun’s hand shattered into pieces as the three disciples’ bodies exploded.

“Y-you…” Mu Chen was completely dumbfounded by the scene of how Lin Yun killed the three of them with a single attack. The domineering demeanour from Lin Yun had given Mu Chen a great shock. After all, Mu Chen didn’t expect that from Lin Yun, who he thought had only defeated Cao Zhen by purely relying on his luck. This was a silent slap to his face, which was even more painful than the palm Chen Hou gave him to the chest.
