Chapter 1498 - Mysterious Palace

When Lin Yun awoke, he found himself in a barren palace. This palace was ancient, and the wall was covered with pictures of the dragon clan, looking majestic. But with time, the pictures were blurred, and he could only see a rough outline. Those pictures were simple, without any unique spiritual runes or other martial intents.

Lin Yun rubbed his head and closed his eyes. When he reopened them, his pupils flashed with a trace of confusion, and he only felt relieved after seeing the Flower Burial Sword beside him. He recalled the strange burst of laughter from the Primordial Demon-Refining Tree and the smiling face that he last recalled, but he couldn’t remember anything else.

Looking over, Lin Yun saw An Liuyan lying on the ground beside him, and her eyes were closed.

“Brother Lin, you’re awake!” Footsteps resounded as a familiar voice rang out.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Xiao Yun. But he was wearing a weird and somewhat ambiguous smile while looking at them.

“Haha. I didn’t expect your relationship with Envoy An to develop so fast. You guys are so close together, and it took a great effort to remove her hands from you.” Xiao Yun winked.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned when he heard that and immediately came to his senses. The smiling face should be Xiao Yun, and An Liuyan probably held onto Lin Yun because she was too frightened.

“What is this place?” Lin Yun asked.

Xiao Yun fell into deep thought and muttered, “This seems to be an ancient palace of the dragon clan. But I don’t know the exact details.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

When Lin Yun glanced at Xiao Yun, he had a feeling that Xiao Yun knew something.

“What about the Primordial Demon-Refining Tree? And those corpses, how did they come to life…” Lin Yun shivered when he recalled that scene. He might not be a butcher, but he had taken many lives with his sword. This further reflected that he had a firm heart, or he wouldn’t have been able to come this far with his sword intent.

But the scenes he saw before were so terrifying that they made his scalp feel numb.

Xiao Yun smiled, “Don’t tell me that you were scared to the point that you lost consciousness, right? Hahaha!”

His laughter confused Lin Yun, and Lin Yun finally understood what was happening after listening to his explanation. Those demonic corpses didn’t come to life, but their teeth chattered when the wind blew. This was where the waves of laughter came from, and it wasn’t anything particularly terrifying.

However, the Primoridal Demon-Refining Tree was peculiar because those sounds were comparable to demonic music. If one was submerged in it for a long time, it would expand the fear in their heart. But they would be fine if they left quickly.

“Those corpses didn’t pose any threat, but the terror lies somewhere else…” Xiao Yun said with a grave expression. Through Xiao Yun’s explanation, Lin Yun finally understood what was happening. So it turned out that the sky would become completely dark at night, and the light that was being emitted from the palaces would also dim.

As the wind blew, a burst of laughter resounded, which meant that the sky was turning dark. At night, the white palace at the top of the mountain was the only safe place before the other places would be covered with demonic corpses.

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that there were also Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses here, and he didn’t want to come in contact with them at all.

“Is she alright?” Xiao Yun asked, looking at An Liuyan from the side.

“Her injuries aren’t serious.” Lin Yun replied. An Liuyan didn’t suffer any injuries; He was the one injured and still hadn’t fully recovered. He swallowed another Profound Wither Pellet and circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to recover from his injuries.

Four hours later, Lin Yun recovered from about 70% of his injuries and barely managed to stabilize himself. But he was still far from recovering to his top form. Regardless of the Aurora Dragon Pupils or Qiongqi’s Strength, he had to pay a considerable price to use them at his current cultivation because they were too heaven-defying.

The power was far beyond what he could control, and Xiao Yun was cautiously looking outside the palace. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he stepped back and left the palace. He could see countless demonic corpses outside the palace, and their crimson pupils were flickering brightly within the darkness.

But before they could get close to the palace, they were sent flying from the saint light that was emitted by the palace.

“Isn’t this a little too terrifying?” An Liuyan’s face changed after she came beside them both upon regaining consciousness.

“We’ll be fine if we stay in the palace.” Xiao Yun said, squeezing out a smile.

“Did you run into any special places in this region?” Lin Yun asked after a brief pondering.

“Special places? What do you mean?” Xiao Yun asked.

“Spatial ripples or places where time and space are distorted.” Lin Yun replied. After all, this place existed in the past, and they would be trapped here if they couldn’t find the nirvana node.

“No, I was only focused on looking for treasures.” Xiao Yun scratched his head. “Aside from the dissolved saint elixirs, there are other saint trees here. Those fruits are a lot more precious, and they’re also more dangerous. I only found three saint fruits so far.”

Lin Yun shook his head, but he didn’t answer. When he looked over, countless demonic corpses were emitting a rotten smell, as if they had crawled out of the ground. They had surrounded the palace and were constantly launching attacks at it.

“Why are these demonic corpses attacking the palace like it’s their instinct? The other palaces are dim, and yet only this palace remains radiant.” Lin Yun suddenly asked.

“Haha.” Xiao Yun smiled. “I’ve long thought about what you said. Are you trying to say that there are treasures in this palace? I’ve searched several times, and I found nothing so far.”

“I remember when we tried to pick the saint elixirs back in the cave. Didn’t they all dissolve?” Lin Yun asked.

“I naturally do.”

“If I’m not mistaken, this is why the palace can still light up. There’s something weird about this.” Lin Yun began to search the palace once he was done speaking. The palace was huge with many rooms, just as Xiao Yun said, but there was nothing in this place, not even any furniture or decorations.

Half an hour later, Lin Yun fell into deep thought as he looked at the paintings on the wall in the main palace. When he waved his hand, the dust on the wall was blown away, and the painting cleared up in his view.

“They’re just some paintings, and I’ve long noticed them. There’s nothing special about them.” Xiao Yun muttered.

“You also noticed that white-clothed man?”

“What white-clothed man?” Xiao Yun raised his head. He was first stunned before he exclaimed, “How is this possible?!”

When the dust was blown away, there was a person surrounded by countless dragons. The entire painting was huge, and one wouldn’t notice it if one didn’t look closely at it. They would only treat it as a background, and no one would notice that white-clothed person.

That white-clothed person had a blade hanging by his waist, giving off a prestigious aura that made him look like a deity.

When he noticed Xiao Yun’s reaction was a little weird, Lin Yun asked, “You recognize this painting?”

“I-I don’t…” Xiao Yun shook his head after coming to his senses.

“He’s lying. But it’s fine because I recognize this person in the painting.” An Liuyan’s voice resounded as she secretly told Lin Yun the identity of this person.

When Lin Yun heard what she said, surprise flashed through his pupils, and this was starting to get interesting now. These two beside him actually knew about this primordial painting, and he knew nothing about it.

“This person is taboo, and no one is allowed to mention this person in the Divine Dragon Empire. Only Ancient Saint Clans have records of him.” An Liuyan’s voice transmitted over. “It’s complicated to explain, so I’ll tell you about it later.”

“Alright.” Lin Yun nodded as he carefully looked at the painting. The more he looked at it, the more profound it felt. But he couldn’t tell what was weird about it. He took several steps back, and a painting appeared behind him, the Aurora Dragon Painting.

“Don’t!” An Liuyan’s face changed when she saw this scene. The last time Lin Yun used this secret technique, he bled from his seven orifices, especially his eyes. An Liuyan even thought that Lin Yun was going to be blind.

“Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing.” Lin Yun took a deep breath because he didn’t have the luxury to slowly search it. After all, there might be a Divine Dragon Bone hidden within this place, and he had no choice but to take the risk, even if it was dangerous to use the Aurora Dragon Pupils.

When the Aurora Dragon Pupils appeared, it could enable Lin Yun to see through all illusions. Just when he was about to reach his limit, Lin Yun smiled, “I found it!”

As blood and tears flowed down the corner of his eyes, he quickly closed them and circulated his cultivation technique to recover. When he reopened his eyes once more, his complexion had gotten a lot better. It was much easier on him if he only used his Aurora Dragon Pupils.

An Liuyan stepped forth, taking out a napkin to wipe the blood off Lin Yun’s eyes, and she said with a smile, “Alright!”

He had no idea what was in the napkin, but the stinging pain soon disappeared.

“What is that?” Lin Yun asked in surprise.

“That’s a secret.” An Liuyan smiled.

“Ahem. Did you two forget that there’s someone else here?” Xiao Yun said in a resentful tone.

Lin Yun smiled and rose into the sky as he gathered all the dragon runes in his right hand. When he pushed his palm forth, the dragon runes poured into the painting, and a surge of aura was building in the blade.

When the aura accumulated to a limit, the blade was suddenly drawn out, and a spatial crack appeared.
