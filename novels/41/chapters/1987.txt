Chapter 1988 - I Have A Friend

“What has Bai Ziyuan taught you?” The Serene Dust Great Saint asked, looking at Lin Yun.

Wait, who’s Bai Ziyuan? Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he knew who the Serene Dust Great Saint was talking about. She must be referring to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, so he said, “Martial Aunt taught me the Divine Firefly Sword and the Wither Sword Art.”

“The Wither Sword Art?” The Serene Dust Great Saint was baffled, and she said, “I never heard of this Wither Sword Art before. Tell me more about it.”

When Lin Yun explained that the Wither Sword Art was similar to the Divine Firefly Sword with thirteen sword forms, and that it was hard to master it. Lin Yun had spent a lot of time on the first sword form alone and barely managed to learn it. His interaction with Bai Shuying gave him more insight into this sword technique, allowing him to progress rapidly.

After hearing Lin Yun’s explanation, the Serene Dust Great Saint laughed, “That’s not any Wither Sword Art. That’s the saint volume of the Divine Firefly Sword, also known as the Divine Sun-Moon Sword. But it’s difficult to practice it without reaching the Saint Realm. Didn’t Bai Ziyuan tell you about it?”

What? Lin Yun was surprised and finally understood why he could feel a connection between this sword technique and the Divine Firefly Sword. So that was the next level of the Divine Firefly Sword.

“In the saint volume, even the radiance of fireflies can compete with the sun and moon. Thirteen swords are equivalent to thirteen steps, and each step is as high as a thousand feet; the difference is huge,” the Serene Dust Great Saint explained. “I might not be a pure swordsman, but I still know a thing or two about the sword. But it’s hard to practice this sword technique without saint aura, and you’ll have to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm, at the very least.”

Lin Yun finally understood why Bai Shuying could practice it when it was tough for him. One must know that Bai Shuying didn’t even grasp Astral Sword Intent, and his sword talent was definitely stronger than hers.

“Bai Ziyuan didn’t tell you about it?” The Serene Dust Great Saint asked coldly.

Lin Yun’s face changed, and he felt that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint might have had a deeper reason for not saying anything. He also couldn’t practice the Thirteen Firefly Swords back then, but he managed to enter the threshold because of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

He now grasped the Astral Sword Intent, which even Saints would have difficulty grasping. This was probably why the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint felt he could practice it, since she didn’t tell him, maybe because it wasn’t the right time or she didn’t tell him on purpose.

“You probably took the fall for Wuming. A Great Saint lowering herself to a junior, how shameless can she be?” The Serene Dust Great Saint said.

Lin Yun smiled awkwardly because that really seemed to be the case. He could sense that the Serene Dust Great Saint didn’t have a good relationship with the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and it was best for him not to get involved in this topic.

“She probably wanted to see you suffer and beg her,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said. “Tell me about the martial techniques you know. I’ll see if I can give you any pointers. You don’t have to worry about suffering here because I will take good care of you.”

“Thank you, Mistress,” Lin Yun thanked and performed all the martial techniques he knew. After reaching the Nirvana Stage, his martial techniques have become systematic. He had the Divine Sunchasing Art for his movement technique, two saint physiques for his body-refining technique, the Sovereign Dragon Fist for fist techniques, Flicking Divine Finger for secret techniques, and the Thirteen Firefly Swords and Sword of the Beginning for sword techniques.

There were also other less commonly used techniques, such as the Heavenly Silkworm Hands and Nether Shackles.

“The Sovereign Dragon Fist?” The Serene Dust Great Saint said, “This is a dragon clan’s martial technique, and I know some of them. Form the Sovereign Dragon Seal, and let me see.”

Lin Yun nodded and began to form seals with dragon aura sweeping out from his body. He formed the Blue Dragon Seal, Silver Dragon Seal, and Golden Dragon Seal before the three seals combined to form the Sovereign Dragon Seal.

“You’re still lacking the White Dragon Seal, Indigo Dragon Seal, Blue Dragon Seal, and Red Dragon Seal of the seven divine dragon seals,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said. “I’ll first teach you the seals and give you a Sovereign Dragon Seal Painting. Focus on perfecting the Sovereign Dragon Seal first. As for the fist technique, I’ll think of a solution for you. So you don’t have to be too anxious about it. If the Sovereign Dragon Seal isn’t complete, you can’t unleash the true power of this fist technique.”

Lin Yun rejoiced when he heard that. The Sovereign Dragon Seal had been incomplete for a long time, and he couldn’t find an opportunity to perfect it. He was already thinking about giving up on it, but he didn’t expect to get the rest from the Serene Dust Great Saint.

“The Dragon Clan has two powerful fist techniques known for their power. They’re the Imperial Dragon Fist and Sovereign Dragon Fist. I would actually prefer that you practice the Imperial Dragon Fist, but forget it since you’ve practiced the Sovereign Dragon Fist,” the Serene Dust Great Saint smiled.

“I’ll listen to the mistress,” Lin Yun smiled.

The Serene Dust Great Saint’s smile became more amicable, and she was even more satisfied when she looked at Lin Yun. She said, “You can stay in the Dustlight Temple to cultivate during your time here. This is where I usually cultivate. Don’t forget about resources as well. You’ve finished all the nirvana pellets, right? I’ll give you some more, including True Dragon Saint Liquid, to nourish your body. I’ll also get a few more Saint Dragon Pellets for you.”

Lin Yun widened his eyes when he heard that because the Serene Dust Great Saint was too generous.

“Oh, I know you and Xin Yan are acquaintances from back in the Profound Amber Realm, but I hope you can keep your identity a secret for now,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said.

“I understand.” Lin Yun nodded as he took a deep breath.

This made the Serene Dust Great Saint see that he had a little heartache, so she comforted him, “You don’t have to worry about it too much. You won’t have to hide your identity after Wuming reaches the Emperor Realm.”

“Can Master really succeed?” Lin Yun asked.

The Serene Dust Great Saint smiled, “Why not? Wuming has a breath held in his chest. Those in the same generation are already dead, and yet he is persevering. Everyone says he’s dying, but I know he will succeed. Do you know what that breath is? Wuming was never weaker than anyone, including the Nine Emperors!”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Lin Yun was briefly stunned because the Serene Dust Great Saint really understood his master. This was what Lin Yun was concerned about. With his master’s talent, he could have already reached the Emperor Realm. But because of that breath, he wanted to reach the same height as the Nine Emperors if he made a breakthrough. Otherwise, he would rather die than become an Emperor.

But the Serene Dust Great Saint’s smile disappeared after Lin Yun left. She wasn’t as optimistic as what she said.

The Dustlight Temple was located in the depths of the Profound Maiden Courtyard, and there was a gigantic thousand-bladed Buddha carved on the cliff. There was a massive plaza before the statue. This place was so densely enveloped in saint aura that it formed a mist around the plaza.

If cultivators stayed here, they could benefit from the saint aura, even if they didn’t cultivate it. This was where the Serene Dust Great Saint cultivated, and this was naturally a superb place to cultivate within the Heavenly Dao Sect since a Great Saint could use it.

Even the most outstanding saint disciple of the Profound Maiden Courtyard or Saint Elders didn’t dare to cultivate here. Xin Yan was an exception, and now, there was Lin Yun.

Relying on the resources given to him by the Serene Dust Great Saint and this place, Lin Yun made a breakthrough and reached the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage in just half a month. Even Lin Yun was amazed by his cultivating speed.

His cultivation stagnated when he was with the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and he only improved in the sword. But with the Serene Dust Great Saint, she felt a heartache for him because his cultivation was too low. She even gave Lin Yun ten Saint Dragon Pellets, which were rare in the world, and countless nirvana pellets; as well as True Dragon Saint Liquid.

According to the Serene Dust Great Saint, Lin Yun needed True Dragon Saint Liquid since he possessed two saint physiques. She got him 12,000 kilograms of seventh-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid. The Serene Dust Great Saint placed it and Lin Yun in a cauldron, before burning them with sacred flames, allowing him to refine and absorb the True Dragon Saint Liquid. She even went as far as to obtain 6,000 kilograms of ninth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid.

Ninth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid was refined with pure-blooded dragons, and even the Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t have much. Lin Yun even wanted to secretly keep some of it because it was too extravagant. But he would be despised by the Serene Dust Great Saint and even laughed at him for not being a country bumpkin.

She only left in satisfaction after watching him refining all of the True Dragon Saint Liquid, and this naturally made Lil’ Purple, who was within the Iris Secret Realm, anxious. But there was nothing Lin Yun could do about it because this was a demand from the Serene Dust Great Saint, and it wasn’t because he didn’t want to secretly keep it for himself.

Ultimately, Lil’ Purple could only puff her cheeks and grumble. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was cold like ice, with no one daring to approach her. She had tempered his sword intent, while the Serene Dust Great Saint was like a honey, doting on Lin Yun, and this experience was something he never felt before ever since he came to the Kunlun Realm.

One day, Lin Yun opened his eyes and saw that Xin Yan was here without him knowing it. Lin Yun wasn’t surprised because they were already familiar with each other over the past fifteen days.

“Senior Sister, you’re really early today,” Lin Yun smiled.

“That’s not it. I’m here to tell you that I’ll be leaving. After all, we can be considered acquaintances over the past fifteen days, despite you being like a block of wood most of the time,” Xin Yan smiled.

“Leave? Where are you going? Are you going to leave the Heavenly Dao Sect?” Lin Yun asked after a brief stun.

“Pffft!” Xin Yan burst into laughter, looking at Lin Yun’s dumbfounded appearance. “Where can I go if I’m not in the Heavenly Dao Sect? I have some matters to attend to at the God Burial Woods. A Divine Blood Flower will bloom soon, and the saint disciples ranked in the top hundredth from the six holy lands will go there.”

“Senior Sister, you’re also on the King Ranking?” Lin Yun pretended to be curious. He didn’t care about the Divine Blood Flower, nor the King Ranking, but was concerned about Xin Yan’s safety. Xin Yan was his weakness and bane.

“I have long reached the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and I was in the top hundredth last year. I should be in the top fifty or even higher now,” Xin Yan confidently said.

The King Ranking didn’t have any Quasi-Saints, but there wasn’t any limit on the age. The scope was the entire Eastern Desolation, and it was terrifying that Xin Yan could be ranked in the top fifty, not to mention that she was still so young.

“I’ll get going now,” Xin Yan said and left.

Lin Yun wanted to open his mouth, but she had already turned around. When he felt a little helpless, Xin Yan suddenly turned around and asked, “Ye Qingtian, do you have something hiding in your heart? You can actually tell me about it. It will form a demon in your heart if you can't resolve it.”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled because he had a lot he wanted to tell Xin Yan, but he couldn’t. Let’s not mention that he couldn’t reveal his identity, but he didn’t dare to, even if he could. He was the one who chose Su Ziyao back then, and it had already been five years since Xin Yan left.

“I knew it. You have something in your heart, and I have long noticed it,” Xin Yan sighed.

Lin Yun briefly hesitated before he smiled, “Actually, it’s nothing. I have a friend, and he ran into some issues.”

“Oh? Go on.” Xin Yan blinked her eyes, but she was laughing inwardly. Was this person really his friend?
