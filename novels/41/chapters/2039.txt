Li Daoyang caressed his messy hair and smiled in disdain, “First? Isn’t that too boring? Master, who was first on the Sword Assembly twenty or a hundred years ago? Master, your eyesight is too low, in my opinion. I bet master didn’t obtain first or even the top three when you were young, right? After all, the Radiant Sword Saint was first at that time.”

Ye Qianyu’s cheeks twitched, but he suppressed his anger, waiting for Li Daoyang to finish his sentence.

“I have been first since I was young, and I’m already bored with it. So there’s no interest in becoming first. Master, what do you think?” Li Daoyang smiled.

Ye Qianyu knocked Li Daoyang’s head and furiously said, “Being cocky in front of me? Speak properly!”

“Let me finish before you try to beat me. Becoming first is really nothing interesting…” Li Daoyang chuckled.

“Are you trying to anger me on purpose?” Ye Qianyu questioned.

Li Daoyang dodged his master’s attack and smiled, “I’m not trying to anger you on purpose. I only want to say that becoming first is nothing. After all, there have been countless firsts over the past three millennia, but everyone only remembers the Nine Emperors. If the Radiant Sword Saint can’t endure this tribulation, even someone like him will be forgotten over time.”

Ye Qianyu sighed upon hearing that because he knew it was true.

Li Daoyang continued, “So it’s boring to bet if he’ll become first. I bet he’ll make the Eastern Desolation’s sword dao rise, and he will be remembered even after a thousand years!”

Ye Qianyu sighed and looked at Ye Qingtian. He then said, “Your evaluation of him is too high.”

“We’ll just have to wait and see if my evaluation of him is too high. Maybe my evaluation of him was still too low,” Li Daoyang said.

Ye Qianyu no longer dwelled on that. He had another reason why he asked Li Daoyang to observe Ye Qingtian. He asked, “Are you sure about him?”

Li Daoyang dropped his smile and said with a grave expression, “Yeah. If I die, let him take over as the sect master if he’s willing to bear the heavenly dao on his shoulders. Either way, we can’t allow those traitors to take over, and it’s about time to deal with them. But I can’t confirm Ye Qingtian’s identity, and I’m not sure if he’s the same Ye Qingtian as before.”

Li Daoyang and Ye Qianyu were discussing the position of Heavenly Dao Sect’s sect master. Only those who have managed to bear the heavenly dao on their shoulders could last long.

Historically, the Heavenly Dao Sect’s sect master only had two outcomes. Their names were either spread throughout the Kunlun Realm or died without even knowing how they died.

Li Daoyang wanted to become the sect master and recollect the separated Heavenly Dao Sect. But he didn’t dare say he could bear the heavenly dao, so he found a replacement. Li Daoyang thought that Ye Qingtian could become a replacement if he failed, but the only problem was Ye Qingtian’s identity.

“I’m not concerned about that,” Ye Qianyu said confidently. He continued, “He has a deep relationship with three Great Saints, Heavenly Jade, Serene Dust, and Dragon Origin. According to how they treated him, they must know him well. Most importantly, Ye Qinghong, Xiao Jingyan, and Zhang Kui mysteriously disappeared within the Myriad Graves Valley not long ago. Everyone suspects that they were killed by Ye Qingtian, it’s just that no one has any evidence to prove it.”

Hearing that, Li Daoyang smiled, “That’s fine, then. Mhm? Why is his sword intent becoming stronger? Don’t tell me he will make a breakthrough to greater mastery?!”

Ye Qianyu also sensed it and exclaimed in surprise, “Astral Sword Intent at greater mastery. Making a breakthrough is difficult, so how did he do it? Was a Nine-Colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit enough? How is that possible?”

“It doesn’t matter because he accomplished the impossible now!”

Li Daoyang and Ye Qianyu exchanged a gaze with joy on their faces. If Ye Qingtian’s Astral Sword Intent could reach greater mastery while he’s at the Nirvana Stage, their Heavenly Dao Sect would’ve obtained a treasure.

Lin Yun sat down on the summit and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon to refine the Heavenly Cloud Fruit, and the sword intent within his brows began to rise. His sword intent would strengthen every single moment. It felt like new worlds were being created.

Not long later, Lin Yun was enveloped by nine colors as black and white figures appeared around him. The scenes within his mind appeared in reality, allowing Lin Yun to comprehend the Divine Firefly Sword. He was like an active volcano; his sword intent was like the accumulated magma waiting to erupt. But it couldn’t erupt because it was stuck by something.

Seeing this, Ye Qianyu’s facial expression became grave, and he stroked his beard, “His bottleneck is too sturdy, and it won’t be easy for him to make a breakthrough.”

“Let me give it a try.” Li Daoyang took a deep breath and ancient runes appeared on his hands. In the next second, Li Daoyang’s body blazed like wild flames with a golden radiance shining from his pupils.

A Quasi-Saint’s aura burst out from Li Daoyang as he opened his mouth and spat out a sword. The entire sword was shining golden with ancient saint runes engraved on it. The moment the sword appeared, the surrounding atmosphere began to ignite, even causing the air to distort.

“Go!” Li Daoyang flicked his finger, and the golden saint sword streaked across the horizon, reaching Lin Yun in the next second.

Bearing this pressure, Lin Yun’s sword intent began to erupt like a volcano. As Lin Yun let out a roar, sword rays shone from his pupils as his sword aura rippled about.

As rumbling sounds echoed, Lin Yun’s sword intent gushing out, fluttering Lin Yun’s hair in the wind as he stood at the summit, looking at the horizon.

The thirty-six layers of heaven broke apart as Lin Yun’s Astral Sword Intent went beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven. Countless stars shone in the surroundings, and Lin Yun’s sword intent manifested into a giant that was looking around.

“Holy shit, he really caused a huge commotion.” Li Daoyang opened his mouth and swallowed the golden saint sword, watching this scene in shock. This was a genuine swordsman in his eyes, which made Li Daoyang envious. He realized what Ye Qingtian said was right, he couldn’t be considered a swordsman when to Ye Qingtian. He practiced the martial techniques from the Dao Yang Palace that focused on his physique, the Devouring Dao.

Ye Qianyu asked, “What if I lost the bet?”

Li Daoyang took a pellet shrouded in a saint radiance and smiled, “You just have to eat this. I’ve accumulated this for three years.”

“What is this?” Ye Qianyu asked with his brows locked together.

“I rubbed it from my armpit, and I guarantee it’s fresh,” Li Daoyang said smugly.

“How dare you!” Ye Qianyu gritted his teeth and pushed his palm forth, “Get lost!”

His palm sent Li Daoyang flying a few thousand meters away, causing Li Daoyang to throw out blood as he clashed against a mountain. When Li Daoyang crawled out from the mountain, he wore a wry smile, “This is the essence of the Great Sun Sacred Flame, and I can’t even bear to give it to the Crane Fairy. Forget it, I’ll just give it to the Crane Fairy, then.”
