Chapter 1521 - The Invincible Sword! (1)

Murong Chen and Ling Qianye thought they could take down Lin Yun, and they didn’t place him in their eyes, judging from their tone. But did they really think that he was a pushover?

Rage flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils. It was rare for him to be furious, and he was genuinely angered this time. Since they wanted to join hands to deal with him, then he couldn’t be blamed for being ruthless.

The moment Lin Yun grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword, his Firmament Sword Intent at complete mastery exploded like a sharp sword. Every single demonic cultivator was a ruthless person with the blood of countless people on their hands.

But countless clowns also died at the hands of Lin Yun. So Murong Chen and Ling Qianye would be too naive to think he didn’t have any temper.

“You seem to be furious.” Ling Qianye squinted his eyes. He then shook his head with a smile, “Well, there’s nothing you can do even if you’re furious. Don’t blame us for joining hands to gang up on you. If you want to blame anyone, you can only blame yourself for being weak!”

When Ling Qianye charged over, his figure began to flicker as the astral energy within his body and demonic aura began to gather.

Then, he unleashed a crimson crescent moon towards Lin Yun. Facing Ling Qianye’s attack, Lin Yun tightened his grip on the Flower Burial Sword, and he could sense a strong connection with it. Pouring his boundless astral energy into the sword, a sword vibration echoed, and a powerful aura exploded from the Flower Burial Sword.

But that wasn’t all for Lin Yun. Even after he destroyed the crimson crescent moon, the remaining power of his attack turned into a roaring azure dragon that was accompanied by a thunderstorm.

This made Ling Qianye’s face change and he took three steps back before he barely managed to avoid that sword ray. He instantly recognized the Azure Dragon Sword Aura that Lin Yun used, and he was surprised by the speed of Lin Yun’s sword.

“Murong Chen, you’re still going to keep your guard up against me? If you’re not going to be serious about this, we might lose the Blue Dragon Bone today!” Ling Qianye indifferently said. As he spoke, he waved his hand, and a white fan appeared.

That was the inheritance saint artifact of the Blood Moon Sect, the Profound Moon Fan. His aura began to violently rise when he opened the fan, and a painting slowly opened behind him. This was his constellation, a crimson moon that emitted a boundless eerie, serene, and devilish aura.

“As you wish!” Murong Chen no longer stood to the side, and drew out a demonic sword. When he unleashed the blade intent from the demonic sword, the sword ray released by Lin Yun’s attack was instantly resolved.

As a blood mist swept out, Murong Chen’s figure then disappeared within the blood mist. But even if he disappeared within the blood mist, his blade rays still existed. Nine blade rays flew out from the blood mist. Each blade ray was further divided into nine blade rays, so the number of blade rays reached an astronomical sum of eighty-one.

As the blade rays intertwined, stars filled the entire sky, and his blade rays perfectly merged with the phenomenon he summoned. When they gathered, the blade rays began to rain down from the sky upon Lin Yun.

Both Murong Chen and Ling Qianye had brought out their saint artifacts and summoned their constellations. At this moment, they weren’t holding back at all.

Ling Qianye’s attack also flew over. His demonic aura had condensed to the limit when he waved the fan in his hand. As a boundless crimson light flew out from his fan, it soon hid within the blood mist that Murong Chen had created.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

This instantly placed Lin Yun in a dangerous position. After all, Murong Chen and Ling Qianye were the strongest amongst the seven chief disciples, and anyone would feel despair if they were in Lin Yun’s position.

As Lin Yun’s hair began to flutter in the wind, the Flower Burial Sword in his hand vibrated with excitement. He only had his sword in his heart, and he didn’t think there was anyone he couldn’t slay.

Nothing would stop him from chasing his sword path. Taking a step forth, Lin Yun pushed the Aquaheaven Sword Technique to the limit. When he gently pricked his sword, a moon rose from the ocean.

Pricking Moon!

When the two moons and three weapons collided, sparks flew around as Lin Yun faced two opponents by himself. This was a terrifying clash, and the entire battle could only be described as roaring waves accompanied by a violent storm.

The hall was spacious but filled with the phenomena the three created. Their phenomena filled every single inch of space, and this battle lasted the time it took for half an incense to burn.

The entire hall was filled with sword intent, blade rays, and crimson lights. Suddenly, Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, and a dragon roar echoed from within his body. An ancient purple-golden armor then appeared on the surface of his body.

The ten thousand dragon runes and blazing Crimson Flame Divine Rune had manifested an Azure Dragon Saint Armor that had reached near perfection. When the armor appeared and enveloped him, he faced Murong Chen’s blade head-on without avoiding it.

When Murong Chen’s blade rays landed on the Azure Dragon Saint Armor, they left several cracks on it. His attack constantly destroyed the dragon runes on Lin Yun’s armor, but Murong Chen’s blade ultimately failed to leave any injuries on Lin Yun, and the rebound force sent Murong Chen flying away.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Lin Yun unleashed a sword ray and forced Ling Qianye out of the blood mist.

But Ling Qianye spread his arms apart while wielding the fan and retreated. The crimson moon behind him was bewitching, and this scene made Lin Yun squint his eyes before he swung his sword once Ling Qianye reappeared.

His attack made Ling Qianye’s face change, and he inwardly cursed. The sudden change of events had placed him in a vulnerable position because he couldn’t avoid this sword at all.

Knowing that this attack would land on him for sure. Before Ling Qianye could think more about it, he closed his fan and used it to block Lin Yun’s attack.

When the phenomena created by Lin Yun’s attack overlapped, a boundless aura exploded that shattered the crimson moon. When his attack collided with Ling Qianye’s fan, over seventy phenomena overlapped together and emitted a blinding brilliance.

When Ling Qianye’s fan was knocked away by Lin Yun’s Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun spread his arms and soared into the sky. He had immediately disappeared from Ling Qianye’s vision, causing the latter’s face to turn pale.
