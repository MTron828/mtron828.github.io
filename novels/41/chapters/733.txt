Chapter 734 - No One Aside From Me

The woman on the mountain was too beautiful. Her features were flawless as she emanated boundless charm and the temperament coming from her was like an ethereal fairy.

The most terrifying part about her was the majestic aura she was emitting. She was like the empress on the nine heavens with a pressure that made others feel like they were suffocating. A woman like her is actually speaking on Lin Yun’s behalf? Just who is she?

Qing Ruoyou’s face also changed as the aura coming from her became even colder. In that split second, everyone could sense the chill coming from Qing Ruoyou and they had fear written on their faces. They knew that she was truly enraged.

The rage of Indigomoon Elysium’s princess wasn’t something they could withstand. Since that woman dared to offend Qing Ruoyou in the Thunder Prefecture, she wouldn’t have a good outcome. In that split second, the entire mountain became dead silent.

No one could imagine how terrifying Qing Ruoyou’s rage would be. If they were implicated by it, not even the four clans and Skycloud Sect could bear her rage.

“Who is speaking?!” Qing Ruoyou said coldly.

“Me!” It was only one word, but the woman’s tone contained boundless confidence and dominance. She landed beside Lin Yun as she looked at Qing Ruoyou standing from up high. The mysterious woman’s face was calm as her grace suppressed everyone, giving everyone a feeling that she was looking down on Qing Ruoyou instead.

Qing Ruoyou was reputed for her beauty throughout the Indigomoon Elysium and the Ancient Southern Domain. But before this woman, Qing Ruoyou was nothing. Everyone who was impressed by Qing Ruoyou’s beauty in the past was no longer impressed. Although none of them said a word, their gazes said everything. When she appeared, Qing Ruoyou’s face had turned dark.

Qing Ruoyou had always been confident in her beauty, even in the entire Ancient Southern Domain. But this woman before her had instantly crushed her, not to mention that she was also protecting Lin Yun. This immediately made her enraged as she barked, “Where did this barbarian come from? Do you want to stop me from killing this sword slave? Get lost! Otherwise, don’t blame me for tearing your face apart!”

Her words were venomous, but the woman had completely ignored Qing Ruoyou as she turned around, “Are you alright?”

Her face had become even gentler when she looked at Lin Yun. But Lin Yun was smiling bitterly. He had imagined them meeting again, but he never expected that they would meet under this situation. Looking at the woman with all of his emotions, Lin Yun muttered, “Ziyao…”

This woman was naturally Su Ziyao! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Do you want me to back down? Let me handle this since it’s a matter between women. In this world, no woman can bully you aside from me,” said Su Ziyao seriously. Due to her cultivation technique, she wouldn’t fall for someone easily. But if she did, she would never change her mind about them.

This woman! Qing Ruoyou’s face turned dark seeing that she was being completely disregarded. When she heard what Su Ziyao said to Lin Yun, she wanted to vomit up blood. Who the hell does this woman think she is? Lin Yun is nothing but a sword slave!

“You’re courting death! I’m determined to slaughter this sword slave!” Qing Ruoyou’s killing aura surged as a purple moon rose up from her back, dying the entire sky purple. The purple moon she created was even stronger than the one used to test the geniuses on the stage.

Qing Ruoyou then soared into the sky as she formed a claw with her hand and grabbed at Su Ziyao. Qing Ruoyou’s face became sinister under the moonlight as wanted to take this woman down before humiliating Lin Yun. She wanted Su Ziyao to know the true meaning of despair.

She had completely unleashed her aura in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm as it spread throughout the sky. Under her aura, the ground began to crack as some people were caught by surprise and vomited blood.

“Quick, disperse!” Everyone panicked as they quickly fled. Qing Ruoyou was too terrifying and they finally understood why people said that she could make it into the top ten on the Draconic Banquet.

But right at this moment, Su Ziyao turned around and a radiance dazzled from her forehead. She emitted a dazzling brilliance as she looked at Qing Ruoyou coldly.

Being glanced at by Su Ziyao, Qing Ruoyou felt both her heart and calw attack stop. She couldn’t move no matter how hard she tried. This made Qing Ruoyou’s face change with fear as this was the pressure of a Heavenly Soul Realm. Furthermore, the aura coming from Su Ziyao was a lot stronger than many elders in the Indigomoon Elysium.

This...what’s going on? The purple moon suddenly shattered and the moonlight started to recede. Everyone was afraid of the aura coming from Su Ziyao.

N-n-no! Qing Ruoyou finally panicked at this moment because she could no longer control her cultivation technique. In the next second, Qing Ruoyou threw up a mouthful of blood and then fell to the ground.

Everyone thought that Su Ziyao would be in a terrible state under Qing Ruoyou’s attack. But the outcome had surprised them as Qing Ruoyou fell on her knees from Su Ziyao’s gaze. It looked as though Qing Ruoyou knelt before her willingly.

What’s going on? The Indigomoon Elysium’s elders were all dumbfounded. They couldn’t figure out what was going on. Not only them, but even those from Heavenly Demon Pavilion and Northern Snow Manor were dumbfounded. They had no idea what was going on.

Lin Yun might be a monstrous genius, but he was still within everyone’s scope of understanding. So much so that they had geniuses on the same level as Lin Yun back at their own sects. What they valued was Lin Yun’s potential. But this woman, who appeared out of nowhere, had surpassed their understanding.

The only thing that they knew was that they had to save Qing Ruoyou. Just when they wanted to make a move, they all felt a chill run down their spine as two people came down from the mountain. One was dressed in a monk’s dress while the other one was a white-clothed gentleman emitting an elegant temperament.

“Falling Aquatic Empyrean!” Everyone was shocked. So it turns out that this woman was the Falling Aquatic Empyrean’s guest. Everyone knew that Falling Aquatic Empyrean was receiving a guest, but they never imagined that he was receiving such a woman, not to mention that she also knew Lin Yun.

“A grain of rice dares to speak with such arrogance before me? Come here!” Su Ziyao barked as the rage in her voice felt like a bolt of rumbling lightning in the sky. It was clearly not directed at them, but it still made them panic.

Before Qing Ruoyou knew what was going on, she was dragged in front of Su Ziyao. Su Ziyao grabbed Qing Ruoyou’s collar before slapping her face.

The slap resounded through the mountain and everyone could sense how painful it was. Everyone’s lips twitched at this sight. The seven geniuses might have been slaughtered by Lin Yun, but this woman was even more ruthless when she slapped Qing Ruoyou. After all, Qing Ruoyou was the Indigomoon Elysium’s princess. Even Chen Ziyu and Chu Muyan had to clean her shoes if she told them to. But this woman actually slapped her…

“You bitch! How dare you slap me!” Qing Ruoyou’s cheek was swollen and her hair was a mess as she screamed. But the only response she received was another slap to the face, which left her dumbfounded.

“So what if I slapped you? If that baldly didn’t convince me not to interfere in a man’s matters, you would be dead,” said Su Ziyao. “The two slaps are the two palms you gave him. Don’t worry, I won’t kill you today. One day, I believe he’ll kill you himself.”

Su Ziyao then tossed Qing Ruoyou away like garbage. The group on Indigomoon Elysium’s stand quickly reached out to grab Qing Ruoyou. But all the elders’ faces were ugly.

“Why are you guys still here?” A cold voice sounded out that instantly doused everyone’s rage when they glared at Su Ziyao. It was the Falling Aquatic Empyrean, the most mysterious expert in Ancient Southern Domain, who spoke.

A brief moment later, Indigomoon Elysium’s group spoke unwillingly, “We’ll leave.”
