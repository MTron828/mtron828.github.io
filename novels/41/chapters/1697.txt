Chapter 1698 – Heavenly Song

Lin Yun followed Elder Gu Jun to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s Pellet Chamber. The Profound Saint Pellets could be used to strengthen mental energy, but it was troublesome to refine, since it was considered a top-tiered Saint Pellet.

Even Gu Jun would have difficulty taking ten out simultaneously, which was why Mu Xueling asked him to go to the Pellet Chamber.

The Pellet Chamber wasn’t far from the Law Enforcement Hall, and the entire process was smooth since Mu Xueqin was the one who spoke out.

But when handing the Profound Saint Pellets to Lin Yun, Gu Jun couldn’t help feeling heartache because these would definitely be subtracted from his pay.

Halfway through handing them to Lin Yun, Gu Jun suddenly smiled, “Lin Xiao, why don’t we negotiate? You can’t finish them in a short period, and using them at your current cultivation level is a waste. Why don’t I swap them to low or mid grades for you? I’ll give you the Profound Saint Pellets when your cultivation is high enough.”

“Not interested.” Lin Yun smiled and snatched the bottle from him. When he held onto the bottle, his pupils radiated with excitement because he knew about the effects of the Profound Saint Pellet.

The effects weren’t at all inferior to the Divine Blood Fruit’s leaves. Most importantly, he had yet to refine this, which meant that the first time would benefit him the greatest, just like how he refined the leaves. Furthermore, he got them for free, and who wouldn’t like freebies?

Looking at the bottle of Profound Saint Pellets, Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling.

Meanwhile, Gu Jun’s lips twitched, and his face became dark. He said, “Don’t you have some conscience? I helped you to speak up earlier.”

“Really?” Lin Yun smiled as he stowed the bottle. Gu Jun did speak out for him earlier, but he became silent after being rebuked by Jiang Yu. After all, Jiang Yu had high prestige in the Law Enforcement Hall, and it would be hard to resolve the matter today if the Saint Elder didn’t stand out.

“Are you really only a musician?” Gu Jun asked when they came out of the Pellet Chamber. His attitude towards Lin Yun had undergone a drastic change. He didn’t have any feud with Lin Yun, to begin with, not to mention he had displayed his breathtaking talent in music dao. So there was no need for him to dwell on the past. It’s just that he felt heartache for the ten Profound Saint Pellets. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Why don’t you take a guess?” Lin Yun smiled. He didn’t give Gu Jun a direct answer.

“I’m guessing that you’re not. There’s no way you can grasp the Saint Tone with your mental energy. The feeling that you gave me is more like a swordsman.” Gu Jun said after a brief pondering.

Lin Yun didn’t say anything to that. Even after disguising himself, he still couldn’t contain his true nature. He felt that his identity would be exposed sooner or later. It’s just that he now had the endorsement of the Heavenly Origin Mirror, and no one would link him up with Lin Yun, for now.

“Who is that?” Lin Yun suddenly stopped when he came out of the Pellet Chamber. He saw three figures flying away, two of whom he was familiar with. Looking at their back figures alone, he could recognize that they were Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi. But why did they just come out of the Law Enforcement Hall?

“Interesting… Were you not recommended by her? It looks like the rumors are true; you have never met the Profound Fairy herself.” Gu Jun smiled.

“So she’s the Profound Fairy.” Lin Yun muttered, and he took a few more glances at her. He was curious about this Profound Fairy because she had a high position in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. So it was a pity that he couldn’t formally meet her.

But for some reason, he found her back figure familiar. It was as though they had met somewhere before.

He soon threw this matter to the back of his mind after the three silhouettes disappeared into the clouds. Since she was in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, they would meet again sooner or later, and he would not need to dwell on it, for now.

“Alright, I’ll be leaving. Thanks for your Profound Saint Pellets.” Lin Yun recollected his gaze and planned to return to his residence.

“You’re really carefree. You better be careful since you have offended Jiang Yu. The Jiang Clan has a huge force in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea as an Ancient Saint Clan.” Gu Jun warned. He felt he should warn Lin Yun about it, and there was no harm in expressing goodwill.

“Alright. I’ll call you if I’m planning to go out.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Brat, are you treating me as your bodyguard?” Gu Jun raged.

“One Profound Saint Pellet. Is it enough?” Lin Yun winked.

“You got a deal!” Gu Jun said immediately, and he added, “You’re not allowed to go back on your words.”

Lin Yun’s lip twitched, and he knew that Gu Jun probably said that on purpose.

In the cave at the summit of the snowy mountain, the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master was together with Mu Xueling. When the pavilion master heard what Mu Xueling said, she asked in a surprised tone, “Is this really his first time hearing the Prairie Phoenix Fire?”

“Most likely.” Mu Xueling could be sure about that.

“So you want him to cooperate with Weiwei?” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master asked. “But he has only been here for two days, so shouldn’t we spend more time observing him to see if he can be trusted?”

Mu Xueling briefly pondered before she said, “If what Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi said is true, there shouldn’t be an issue with his character. Furthermore, we don’t have a choice. We have already tried everyone we can. They’re talented but can’t build rapport with Weiwei.”

“The Nine Heavenly Profound Dance won’t reach its peak without the Ni Chang Dress Song. Based on Lin Xiao’s attainment of ancient songs, we can let him try it. But…”

“But what?”

“I heard that when he first came, he was lecherous and was even rude towards you.” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master said. “Are you sure you want to give him this chance?”

With a smile, Mu Xueling replied, “Pavilion Master, you’re too overly concerned. That fellow is extremely arrogant, and I don’t have any good impression of him. But what you said isn’t wrong. He has a shocking attainment in ancient scores, and his talent is even higher than mine!”

“Higher than you?” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master wasn’t willing to believe it.

Mu Xueling recalled the four questions Lin Yun asked her back in the Law Enforcement Hall, but she couldn’t answer them.

“He might still be lacking in skills, but he has a lot of experience that I don’t. He opened a whole new world for me with his Prairie Phoenix Fire, and I can sense that my bottleneck has shaken. I have found some clues of making a breakthrough now.” Mu Xueling said.

“Are you serious?” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master was shocked. What Mu Xueling said piqued her interest in Lin Yun even more.

“I want to meet him.” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master said.

“I will naturally let you meet him, but keep this from Weiwei for now. I’m afraid that she’ll be distracted because of this.” Mu Xueling said.

“Okay.”

Three days later, Lin Yun had refined two Profound Saint Pellets in his residence, and his cultivation as a Saint Spiritualist was forcibly raised to the sixth-grade Saint Spiritualist.

According to Mu Xueling, he could now barely unleash the power of the Saint Tone as a sixth-grade Saint Spiritualist. But he still wasn’t satisfied with that because eight Profound Saint Pellets were left, including a Rainbow Saint Leaf. It should be able to help him reach seventh-grade Saint Spiritualist.

He should have an easier time facing those at the seventh or eighth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm at that time. It was so much so that he might even be able to hold his ground against someone at the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. But the damage on his two remaining dragon pulses was a headache.

Suddenly, the Heavenly Fragrance Medal trembled. “Come to the Saint Altar.”

Lin Yun’s heart trembled because there wasn’t a commotion for three days. He thought this woman wasn’t willing to see him, but she finally called. Toward Mu Xueling, Lin Yun naturally respected her. No matter what, she was someone who was comparable to a Saint.

Half an incense later, Lin Yun came to the Saint Altar. The Saint Altar was empty, and there wasn’t a single person left. He still remembered that this place was flocking with people three days ago, but there wasn’t a single person today. Did he come too early?

Lin Yun entered the Saint Altar with doubt because this place was pretty empty today, and there wasn’t anyone else besides Mu Xueling. When sunlight shone onto her, it made her look even more dignified than usual.

Just when Lin Yun dazed off, Mu Xueling suddenly opened her eyes. Her eyes were watery, and Lin Yun had to admit that Mu Xueling had a unique temperament, even if he had seen many beauties in his lifetime. Not only did she have the liveliness of a young girl, she even had the pressure of a Saint.

“Sit.” Mu Xueling pointed forth, and she signaled Lin Yun to sit in front of her.

This made Lin Yun even more baffled. Sitting down on a mat, he commented, “Looks like I came early today.”

“You’re not early because you’re the only one here today. In the future, I will personally teach you the Ni Chang Dress Song.”

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun felt unbelievable because this treatment was a little too good.

“What’s the matter? You think that I’m not qualified to teach you?” Mu Xueling didn’t have any changes on her face, but Lin Yun could clearly sense a descending Quasi-Saint’s pressure.

“I dare not to doubt your attainment in music dao. I still have a lot to learn, and you’re more than enough to teach me… But, what’s with this Ni Cang Dress Song?”

“You’ll know later.” Mu Xueling didn’t say much, but she started teaching Lin Yun the Ni Cang Dress Song. This was an ancient score and it was even more complex than the Prairie Phoenix Fire. The artistic concept contained within it was more long-lasting, containing an extremely ancient rhythm.

The music rhythm was chaotic, which made him feel dizzy. With Lin Yun’s talent, he had to practice several times before memorizing the first portion of the song.

An hour later, he finally gave it a try. He was still ripe initially, but he became more proficient in it. Lin Yun was a musical genius to grasp such a complicated ancient score so quickly, which shocked Mu Xueling.

“This score still has something lacking…” Lin Yun said in an uncertain tone.

“What’s lacking?” Mu Xueling asked. She was briefly stunned in her heart but didn’t reveal any facial expression.

“A person.” Lin Yun said. “This is a heavenly song and naturally requires a celestial dance.”

Mu Xueling was stumped when she heard that, and she looked at Lin Yun in disbelief. She asked, “How do you know about it?”

“I guessed it.” Lin Yun winked.

Mu Xueling appeared before Lin Yun in a flash and grabbed onto his shoulder before he could even react.

“Come with me!” Mu Xueling grabbed Lin Yun and soared to the sky, immediately heading towards the snowy mountain.

As a violent wind poured into his ears, Lin Yun was shocked at where Mu Xueling was bringing him to.
