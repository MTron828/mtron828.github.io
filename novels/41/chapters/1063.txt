Chapter 1064 - Divine Leaves’ Dew

When Lin Yun thought about everything, he realized that the final battle was about twenty days away. The final battle was the final test in the Heavenly Path where each cultivator would be picked by a powerful sect in the Kunlun Realm. Then again, this was the minimum requirement for entering the Kunlun Realm. There was no guarantee that he would even get there since geniuses were plentiful in Kunlun Realm.

If one wasn’t born in the Kunlun Realm, they would have to go through the Heavenly Path. After all, those from the Kunlun Realm were geniuses that were practically born in the sky. Geniuses from the lower realms had to do their very best just to see the geniuses in the sky. There were few who could make a name for themselves, but that didn’t deter the lower realms from trying.

However, the same couldn’t be said for the Realm Sons. The Heavenly Path was just a game to them. With their noble status, they were qualified to compete with the geniuses from Kunlun Realm. So ever since entering the Heavenly Path, the Realm Sons only cared about the final battle. After all, the champion could obtain a Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit, which was something that one could refine in the Heavenly Soul Realm. Legends said that upon refining the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit, one could make their seven xiantian souls reach the supreme realm.

The Nether Divinity, Profound Dragon, and Elysium Trigram Realm Sons didn’t have a care in the world right now. After all, they thought that Lin Yun was dead. When Lin Yun thought about them, a cold light flashed in his eyes. He was determined to kill all three of them even if it meant offending their respective clans.

“Are we going to leave this forbidden region first?” Yue Weiwei asked with her brows locked together. After all, it was hard to differentiate the direction within the thick fog.

“No need to worry,” said Lin Yun. “The space in this forbidden region isn’t stable. If we were somewhere else, my Sword of the Beginning might not be able to break through this realm. Luckily, that’s not the case.”

Due to the ancient battle between the gods, the space here was no longer stable. So with the Sword of the Beginning, Lin Yun could tear a hole in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.

“Let me try it right here.” Lin Yun found a spot in the forbidden region and started picturing the Sword of the Beginning in his mind. In the next second, he had swung the Flower Burial Sword, unleashing a dazzling sun that appeared behind him. It was so bright that all space seemed to freeze. It was as if the only light source was from Lin Yun’s sword. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The attack left a huge crack in the sky, which showed how powerful Lin Yun’s new sword was. When Yue Weiwei saw this scene, her mouth dropped in disbelief. She couldn’t believe the sheer power of the attack. She couldn’t imagine a single person in the Heavenly Soul Realm who could fend off Lin Yun’s sword. Furthermore, the sword was only in its initial stages, so it had a lot of growth potential.

Lin Yun let out a breath and grabbed onto Yue Weiwei’s hand, “Let’s go!”

Just like that, the two of them charged out of the crack with Lil’ Red. When they discovered that they were out of the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, the two of them let out a breath.

“We’re out!” Yue Weiwei rejoiced. “Big Brother Yun, you’re really formidable!”

Lin Yun merely smiled in response because he didn’t know if Yue Weiwei really meant that. Her strength was too hidden for him to decipher. Yue Weiwei spread her hands open and took out the jade bottle. When she poured her origin energy into it, the bottle began to shine brightly. At this moment, they could see the Divine Blood Fruit and its seven glittering leaves.

“Big Brother Yun, the price of this Divine Blood Fruit is unimaginable. It’s so precious that you can obtain the promise of a saint with it. I’m really happy that you’re giving it to me,” said Yue Weiwei with glittering eyes.

“I don’t need it. It’s for you anyways,” replied Lin Yun calmly. He knew that this item was precious, but it would also bring him a lot of trouble. After all, he understood the crimes of possessing treasures that he couldn’t protect. Since Yue Weiwei came for the Heavenly Path, there was no reason why he couldn’t give it to her.

Yue Weiwei rejoiced inwardly when she heard that. It turned out that she had a place in Lin Yun’s heart. It seemed like he didn’t just save her because of a casual promise that he made. She felt incredibly happy at this moment. So much so that her smile radiated like a full moon in the night sky. Although she was a demoness, Lin Yun could feel a trace of gentleness and bashfulness from her.

“Big Brother Yun, the dew on the leaves are extremely miraculous. Which one do you want to refine?” Each leaf contained a different dao rhyme, which meant that the effects of each dew was different.

Lin Yun already knew how miraculous the leaves were after fighting the Divine Blood Fruit for nine days. After all, each one of the leaves contained a different martial intent and a holy spirit martial technique. In total, there was the wind, flame, thunder, ice, earth, life, and death martial intents. The dew on the leaf of life could save someone who was dying and the dew on the leaf of death could allow someone to comprehend death intent.

Lin Yun knew he couldn’t refine the life or death intent because he wasn’t proficient in either of them. The only ones he was proficient in were wind and thunder. There were ten droplets of dew on each of the leaves, so Lin Yun pondered briefly before he replied, “Can I have one droplet of thunder and wind?”

He wanted to give these two a try. It was naturally best if he could refine everything, but he needed to be realistic. So he was just looking forward to the effects of refining the dew.

“Big Brother Yun, you’re not going to ask me why I need the Divine Blood Fruit?” Yue Weiwei asked.

“No need. It’s enough for me if I know they will help you,” replied Lin Yun.

“But I want to tell you!” Yue Weiwei became a little angry and glared at Lin Yun. She was furious that Lin Yun wasn’t concerned about her.

“Go ahead then. I’m pretty curious why you need it.”

Yue Weiwei’s face quickly turned into a smile when she heard that. Clearly, Lin Yun was concerned about her. Without any hesitation, she replied, “I need it to save my mother. My mother fell into a deep slumber when I was young and she’s been in a state between life and death. I can only wake her from her slumber with the Divine Blood Fruit. My father is strong, but he also has many enemies. So it’s too hard for him to obtain the Divine Blood Fruit. He didn’t want to pay the price to obtain it, so I snuck into the Heavenly Path for it. Otherwise, I wouldn’t need your Divine Blood Fruit.”

Lin Yun finally understood why Yue Weiwei was going through so much pain for the Divine Blood Fruit. From the seal in her body, he could tell that her true cultivation was really strong. Clearly, she paid a great price to descend into the Profound Amber Realm. If it wasn’t for the Divine Blood Fruit, she also wouldn’t have gotten caught by the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

Looking at Yue Weiwei again, Lin Yun began to feel heartache for her. He couldn’t imagine the pain she felt when her mother fell into that mysterious state. He also couldn’t imagine the price she had to pay in order to descend to the Profound Amber Realm, let alone leaving her home.

When he first met her, she innocently smiled at him next to a lake. He never would have suspected that she was going through so much pain, nor did she ever tell him about it. It seemed like the only thing she wanted Lin Yun to remember was her smile.

“I’m done!” Yue Weiwei smiled and took out two droplets of dew before Lin Yun had a chance to reply. One droplet of dew contained wind intent and the other contained thunder intent. Both of them contained boundless spiritual essence.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun tossed the two droplets of dew into his mouth. In the next second, every corner of his body was filled with immense power that started to leak out of his pores.

Lin Yun’s eyes turned bloodshot as traces of blood started to flow down. It seemed like the pressure was so great that he was about to explode. Suddenly, Yue Weiwei retreated with the bottle. If she didn’t retreat in time, she might have been injured from Lin Yun’s pressure.

“He should be fine.” Yue Weiwei comforted herself. Even the dew on the leaves weren’t easy to refine. Lin Yun had to be careful or else he could lose his life.

But he didn’t have a choice because he had to catch up to the Realm Sons. All of the Realm Sons had great foundations, so Lin Yun had to make up for the gap. Plus, he revealed all of his trump cards. When the Realm Sons were done basking in the Saint Spiritual Lake, they would surely have a huge boost in their strength.

Lin Yun’s violent state lasted for a long time, which worried Yue Weiwei. But suddenly, a dragon roar echoed from within Lin Yun’s body that calmed the violent energy surging within his body. At the same time, a dragon flew out of Lin Yun’s body and coiled around him while emitting immense pressure.

“Success!” Yue Weiwei rejoiced because Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Aura was showing signs of evolving into a holy spirit. If he succeeded, then he would no longer have to exhaust his vitality and could only rely on his sword aura and dragon aura together.
