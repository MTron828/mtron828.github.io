Chapter 1317 - Silversnow Valley

“I hope so.” Feng Jue calmed himself before he turned around and left. He could only pray that nothing happens or the eight big sects would be responsible if he flared up and alarmed his master.

“Elder Lin, who’s Martial Uncle Feng’s Junior Brother?” The nearby Dragon Pulse Realm elder asked. His question made Lin Zhen briefly stunned because it looked like no one knew about Jian Jingtian’s name anymore. Time had passed quickly, and eighteen years had passed in the blink of an eye.

“Who else? The invincible Jian Jingtian, ranked first on the three rankings,” said Lin Zhen.

When everyone heard that, they were all shocked. At the same time, they had no idea that Jian Jingtian still had a daughter. The name of Jian Jingtian was resounding, not to mention that he was a legend in the Sword Sect about twenty years ago.

He was said to be a genius who could inherit the Radiant Sword Saint, and many people could see the hope of returning to being a holy land from him. When he was in the Empyrean Ranking, he was invincible. That was the same when he was on the Elysium Core Ranking and Dragon Pulse Ranking.

But someone like him made a mistake eighteen years ago, and he was expelled by the Radiant Sword Saint before he disappeared.

“T-That person, he is still alive?” Someone asked carefully. After all, it had been some time since anyone heard about him, so they naturally thought that he had already died.

“He is,” replied Lin Zhen with his brows knitted together; he was thinking about what was going on at the Profound Wither Island. The eight big sects had besieged the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts weren’t doing anything. Anyone could tell that there was something fishy, and this made him wonder what happened on the Profound Wither Island over the past month.

Wearing a grave expression, Lin Zhen began to wonder who the big sects were waiting for to make such a big fuss.

Above a boundless forest on the Profound Wither Island, Mu Qingqing was rushing at full speed with ten-odd disciples from the Sword Sect. They were all carrying sword boxes, emitting terrifying sword intent. But Mu Qingqing stood out even more amongst them. She had a unique temperament, to begin with, not to mention that she was also a beauty. They were fast, and they didn’t stop along the way.

“We’re almost there.” Mu Qingqing’s eyes flashed as the Silversnow Mountain Range appeared before them. It was so much so that she could faintly hear the zither music coming from the valley.

Right at that moment, a beam of light shot down before their path. When the beam of light landed in the forest, countless demonic beasts panicked and began to flee for their lives. This was a person, and the aura he gave off easily suppressed everyone from the Sword Sect, reaching an unbelievable height. “One of the Three Saints of the Profound Sky Sect, Lei Jue!”

Mu Qingqing stopped with her brows locked together. The Three Saints of the Profound Sky Sect were at the top of the pyramid on the Empyrean Ranking. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have occupied the top three spots. Aside from Qin Cang, who was ranked first, Xuan Ying and Lei Jue were both transcendent geniuses, and their strengths weren’t much weaker than Qin Cang.

But since Qin Cang’s existence was too dazzling, he practically stole all the limelight from Lei Jue and Xuan Ying. So there was no doubt that the three had the qualifications to become a saint, and each of them was so terrifyingly strong that every genius in the Ancient Barren Domain knew about them.

It was so much so that their fear for Lei Jue and Xuan Ying was even greater than Qin Cang because Qin Cang hadn’t shown up much in the past two years. So Lei Jue and Xuan Ying were practically the ones interacting with the outside world.

Just by seeing the fear in the eyes of Sword Sect disciples, one could tell how terrifying Lei Jue was.

“Stop here. As for what’s going on in the Silversnow Valley, you guys can just watch.” Lei Jue tugged his arms together with a smile.

“Then I have to apologize. Draw your swords!” Mu Qingqing barked with a smile. In the next second, everyone from the Sword Sect drew their swords. When they wielded their swords, an aura began to spread out and formed into a sword array.

This sword array had a huge origin that combined the strength of ten people. When the power of this array unfolded entirely, it could even confront Greater Elysium Core Realm experts.

“What ignorance. You guys have no idea what true power is…” Lei Jue smiled before he pushed his palm out. The ancient rune in his palm shone brightly with myriads of lightning beams forming into a dazzling sun.

Aside from Mu Qingqing, all the other Sword Sect’s disciples were sent flying away, and they couldn’t even grab onto their swords. As thunderclouds began to rumble, Lei Jue’s hair began to flutter, and said, “Mu Qingqing, you should know well that if we really fight, no one else can survive aside from you.”

Mu Qingqing was surprised when she saw the ancient rune because it was an origin saint rune. She couldn’t believe that Mu Qingqing didn’t imprint the origin saint rune on his elysium core after subduing it. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Do you really have to stand against our Sword Sect?” Mu Qingqing instantly fell into a difficult position.

“Nah, we’re not at that step, yet. Don’t worry. We’re only trying to force Flower Burial to appear and nothing else.” Lei Jue replied.

“What if he doesn’t come?” Mu Qingqing asked because that was the key.

.

“Well, it’ll be a different story if he doesn’t show up. After all, someone has to die with the eight big sects joining forces together, right? What do you think?” Lei Jue smiled with a wink.

Mu Qingqing was furious, but she was also placed in a dilemma. She didn’t expect that not only did the Profound Sky Sect get involved in this matter, but they even sent out Lei Jue.

On the other hand, Luo Shuyi, the transcendent genius of the Heavenly Note Sect, was also stopped along the way.

The one stopping her was Xuan Ying of the Three Saints of the Profound Sky Sect, who smiled, “Lady Luo, please go back. This path isn’t available!”

The women behind Luo Shuyi were wielding all sorts of musical instruments, and they all looked like gorgeous lotuses with extraordinary temperaments.

“It’s really troublesome to see Young Master Xuan here.” Luo Shuyi helplessly smiled while glancing at the Silversnow Mountain Range. Knowing that it was impossible for them to head over, she began to doubt what the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect did for them to be besieged by the eight big sects.

“Can I know why the Profound Sky Sect is involved in this matter?” Luo Shuyi asked in a beautiful voice.

“Flower Burial,” replied Xuan Ying.

When Luo Shuyi heard that, she was surprised because she didn’t think that Flower Burial had really come to Profound Wither Island. Mu Qingqing had a wide connection, not only with the Heavenly Note Sect, but also with the Profound Valley, Emerald Jade Valley, Heavenly Blade Pavilion, and even the Vajra Monastery. But they were all stopped along the way.

The Sword Sect might be strong, but there was no way they could take on the Profound Sky Sect alone. After all, the Profound Sky Sect was the undisputed overlord in the Ancient Barren Domain. Unless it was something that involved their interest, there was no way they would provoke the Profound Sky Sect.

Those inside the Profound Wither Island couldn’t see it all, but those outside the island were completely shocked. They couldn’t believe that one Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had gotten so many powerful sects involved, and this was something that no one had thought of.

Not long later, someone understood through lip reading that the Profound Sky Sect was looking for Flower Burial, and this sparked an uproar with everyone asking who Flower Burial was. Very quickly, everything about Flower Burial began to spread like wildfire and instantly caused a huge uproar.

All of their attention was on the Silversnow Valley, and this included the Samsara Edict Realm experts. At the same time, the elders of the eight big sects became nervous because they knew that their disciples only wanted to deal with Lin Yun.

But they never expected that it would cause such a huge mess. No matter what those from the eight big sects were thinking right now, everyone was curious if Flower Burial would show up here.

In the Silversnow Valley, at the heart of the valley was a unique array with boundless vitality blooming like flowers.

Lin Yun withdrew his golden wings and landed on the ground together with Qin Tian and Zhang Ting.

“Over here. This valley is unique, and it’s a forbidden land. All the disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect are gathered here, including Lady Luo Hua.” Qin Tian told everything he knew to Lin Yun.

Luo Hua was also here? Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a cold light because things were getting more interesting.

“Let me see where the big sects get their guts from!” Lin Yun coldly said and emitted a terrifying pressure. Compared to one month ago, when he had just entered the Profound Wither Island, Lin Yun’s strength had undergone a drastic transformation.

If it was before, Lin Yun might have had some trouble facing the experts from the eight big sects. But he now had the confidence face them without any trouble. At most, he could just bring out his firmament sword intent and Sovereign Constellation to slaughter them all, even if he had to give up on the great saint origin.

Whether it was Luo Hua, Ye Ziling, or the other disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, touching them meant violating his bottom line.

“Are we really going to head over there? The eight big sects are all gathered there. Why don’t we wait for Flower Burial?” Qin Tian and Zhang Ting said with fear on their faces. They could feel their hearts beating wildly because the eight big sects had Greater Elysium Core Realm experts with saint artifacts.

“I already said that I’m Flower Burial. Today, no one can stand in my way, no matter what,” said Lin Yun before he charged forth.

Qin Tian and Zhang Ting were both shocked when they heard that and had no idea if they should believe those words. At the same time, they could feel their hearts boiling because this was what a swordsman should look like, fearless even if he had to face the eight big sects.

Suddenly, they both felt a chill down their spines because Lin Yun had come to a stop. Up ahead were disciples of the big sects blocking the way, there was a person kneeling on the ground and covered in blood.

This scene made Qin Tian and Zhang Ting shocked because that was Jiang Lichen, the chief male disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect!
