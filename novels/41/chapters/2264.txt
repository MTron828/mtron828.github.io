Chapter 2265 - You Won't Be Able To Master It!

At this moment, everyone knew why Lin Yun was called Flower Burial. The Ying River King was in a pathetic state, with his white robe dyed red with his blood and one knee on the ground.

What happened earlier was too bizarre; it felt like heaven and earth had been inverted. Even if the Ying River King had brought out two Sovereign Daos, Lin Yun still suppressed him and couldn’t display any advantage.

But Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless while in the air. Others didn’t know, but Lin Yun knew the Ying River King was a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit. The physique of a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit could compete with divine physiques. Other Demonspirits might be heavily injured from his attack, but this level of injury couldn’t be considered serious to the Ying River King.

A golden radiance shone from the Ying River King as he began to recover at a rapid speed.

“I now know the meaning that there’s always someone better than you in the world.” The Ying River King stood up as he coldly looked at Lin Yun with arrogance and disdain. He continued, “You’re not lying. I might die if I’m not careful.”

“Well, I never lie.” Lin Yun smiled as though he had just received praise.

“But don’t think that you’ve defeated me just like that. Let me see if you have a heaven-defying sword technique!” The Ying River King’s face became cold as he shook his wrist, unleashing a blade ray that was directed at Lin Yun’s neck.

In the path of the blade ray, ancient chants could be heard as the surrounding space appeared to be restricted by a mysterious world’s power that came from the Heavenly Moon Blade.

Lin Yun’s face changed because his back would be exposed if he turned around. His flaw would be revealed no matter how he responded to this move. But he was calm as he let go of the Flower Burial Sword, which flew back and clashed with the Heavenly Moon Blade behind him.

When the two weapons clashed, the Ying River King took the opportunity to come before Lin Yun, wanting to suppress the latter.

The palm knocked Lin Yun down, then the Ying River King approached again before he could regain his footing.

“Nethermoon Light!” The Ying River King unleashed a domain that enveloped the surrounding area. As he stepped forth, he formed a seal with his left hand and two dao flowers bloomed with the two Sovereign Daos overlapping.

The Heavenly Moon Blade held down the Flower Burial Sword. After a brief pondering, Lin Yun wanted to test his current strength to see their differences as they clashed with their palms. Boundless saint aura gushed out as Lin Yun attacked with his full strength despite their huge cultivation difference. One was a Quasi-Saint, while the other was a fourth-stage Saint Lord.

Lin Yun was defeated on the spot and at adisadvantage, even with the Azure Dragon Divine Physique reaching greater mastery.

The difference between saint aura and saint energy was too huge. Lin Yun inwardly muttered and roughly had an idea of the difference now. The consequences might have been dire if it wasn’t for the Azure Saint Cloth.

“Sword God, Sword God. Are you still a god without a sword in your hands?” The Ying River King showed a sinister smile. The Ying River King charged forth once more when he was done speaking.

“Even if I don’t have a sword, I have one in my heart.” Lin Yun smiled as his fighting spirits rose once more. He now had a rough gauge of his strength, so he used his fingers as a sword.

But since the Flower Burial Sword wasn’t in his hand, the power of his attack had been greatly reduced. After getting used to the Ying River King’s strength, he relied on the Divine Firefly Sword’s profundity to unleash countless sword rays, shining brightly in the dark.

“Lin Yun is crazy. Even without a sword, he can evenly fight against the Ying River King.”

“This is unimaginable. Anyone can tell with a glance that the Ying River King isn’t an ordinary Demonspirit.”

“A Sword God is still a Sword God even without a sword in his hand.”

All the Eastern Desolation cultivators and holy lands could feel their blood boiling after watching this scene and became subdued by Lin Yun’s strength. This was a swordsman from the Eastern Desolation, which they took pride in.

“Are you done?!” The Ying River King was furious as he pushed his hands forth, creating an explosion within his body. He finally activated his bloodline and shone with a dazzling golden radiance. The aura he released became even stronger, shattering Lin Yun’s sword aura, and forcing him to take ten-odd steps back.

“Not good!” The faces of the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s cultivators changed, with Ji Zixi becoming nervous as she turned to look at the old man beside her.

Li Feibai opened her mouth as her heart sank. They wanted to save Lin Yun, but they needed more time to respond.

“Die!” Before Lin Yun could regain his footing, the Ying River King dashed forth with space shattering in his path. Under everyone’s shocked gazes, a palm was heading towards Lin Yun’s chest.

But before the palm could come into contact with Lin Yun, a powerful current illuminated the darkness, leaving everyone dumbfounded. Facing this attack, everyone felt that Lin Yun would be heavily injured, even if he wasn’t dead.

“Great!” Huang Jingyu was excited as he clenched his fists with excitement on his face. He had his emotions pent up after witnessing what had happened earlier, but he could vent them out now.

But something bizarre occurred. A flower had flown out of Lin Yun’s chest and bloomed on his right shoulder. The Othershore Flower instantly attracted everyone’s attention, looking dreamy. It’s as if it was the manifestation of all the beauty in the world.

Even the Ying River King was briefly dazzled when he looked at the Othershore Flower.

Taking advantage of this moment, Lin Yun executed the Sovereign Dragon Seal and a seven-colored radiance shone brightly.

When the Sovereign Dragon Seal fell onto Ying River King’s chest, it shattered the latter’s saint energy and pierced his chest, while leaving behind a huge crater that was a thousand meters away.

The Ying River King took ten steps back with one knee on the ground, clutching his chest while throwing out blood.

On the other hand, Lin Yun flew back, heading towards the Flower Burial Sword. But surprisingly, he didn’t reach out for the Flower Burial Sword, but had grabbed onto the Heavenly Moon Blade instead.

The Heavenly Moon Blade began to struggle. It was a Fourspirit Glory Saint Artifact that had pride and did not want to be subdued by others.

Lin Yun ignored the resistance of the Heavenly Moon Blade and held onto the blade's hilt and tip. As the Azure Dragon Divine Rune appeared on his chest, a terrifying power coursed through his body. His hands had become a pair of azure dragon claws.

While Lin Yun’s face was reflected on the blade’s body, the Heavenly Moon Blade began to tremble in fear.

When the Ying River King raised his head from the ground, he angrily roared, “You dare?!”

“Why wouldn’t I dare?” Lin Yun exerted force and snapped the Heavenly Moon Blade. The fragments had shattered like glass and flew around. From afar, it looked as though Lin Yun had crushed a moon.

When the blade was shattered, a boundless moonlight shone from the sky, enveloping Lin Yun and making him look like a gentleman.

“Holy shit…” Li Feibai couldn’t help cursing, her heart violently beating and her face becoming red. After a while later, she muttered, “How dashing.”

Not only her but everyone else was dumbfounded.

“What the hell just happened?”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“He turned the tables around just like that?”

“The Othershore Flower… Isn’t Lin Yun a little too calm? Wasn’t he afraid that the Othershore Flower might have been ineffective against the Ying River King?”

“What do you know? That’s the pride and grace of a swordsman!”

Exclamations came from the surrounding area, with everyone being shocked by this scene.

When Qu Wushuang finally came to his senses after a long time, he couldn’t help turning to look at Ji Zixi, whose eyes were shining brightly as she looked at Lin Yun. At this moment, Qu Wushuang knew that he had lost again.

Liu Yunlan was still alright amongst the three holy lands. He only felt inferior to Lin Yun and nothing else. But Huang Jingyu’s face was pale and looked even more terrible than the Ying River King, who was kneeling on the ground.

The Ying River King threw out a mouthful of blood, his pale face reddened with anger. But just when he wanted to open the vertical eye on his forehead, a figure descended from the sky and grabbed his shoulder. At this moment, he knew that he had lost and that there wasn’t any meaning in continuing this fight. They initially felt that it shouldn’t be an issue for them to obtain the divine flames without any pressure, but Lin Yun had ruined it all.

“We’re leaving this place!” Zhao Tianyu saw that the surrounding holy lands were in high morale because of Lin Yun’s performance, and was looking at them with enmity. Even if the Ying River King opened his vertical eye, he might still be unable to turn the tables around.

He grabbed the Ying River King before the holy lands could respond and soared to the sky. When he rose to the sky, he locked eyes with Lin Yun.

“Ye Qingtian, you have given me a surprise. Someone was still worried for your safety, but it looks like that person is over-concerned.” Zhao Tianyu addressed Lin Yun as Ye Qingtian by habit before he left this place.

Lin Yun could faintly hear people saying something about not wanting to let them escape, but no one chased after them in reality. He recollected his thoughts and summoned the Flower Burial Sword, which then disappeared into his chest.

“How did you manage to do that?” Li Feibai’s eyes shone with shock when she saw this scene.

“You want to know how?” Lin Yun asked with a smile.

Li Feibai nodded her head after hearing what Lin Yun said.

“Hahaha! You won’t be able to master it!” Lin Yun teased Li Feibai before heading over to the Divine Phoenix Mountain party while laughing.
