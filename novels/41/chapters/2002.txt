Chapter 2003 - Dying An Uncontented Death

I’m Flower Burial, someone who buries flowers and people alike.

Those words, and Flower Burial’s name, had long spread throughout the Kunlun Realm, and everyone knew what that meant. If someone else said that, Xiao Jingyan and the Indigocloth Venerable naturally wouldn’t care about that and would even sneer at the person who said that.

But it was a different case for Ye Qingtian. After all, Ye Qingtian killed ten-odd experts at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage with one sword and killed the seven god generals in a split second. Not to mention Ye Qingtian even executed the Astral Sword Intent.

In the entire Kunlun Realm, there weren’t many people with such a talent in sword dao. So when Ye Qingtian said those words, they instantly realized who he was. To possess such a powerful talent in sword dao, who else was he if he wasn’t Flower Burial?

Lin Yun also couldn’t be bothered to act anymore. The Divine Tortoise Transformation dissipated and restored his true appearance with a single thought. This was a handsome face with exquisite features. The purple mark on his forehead gave him a hint of devilish temperament.

“Flower Burial!” The Indigocloth Venerable exclaimed, and her face became uncertain. She immediately turned around, not daring to stay here for another second. She had to report this to the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, or the holy maiden would suffer when facing Lin Yun.

Lin Yun only glanced at her, before simply ignoring her. Xiao Jingyan also ignored the Indigocloth Venerable, and his gaze was fixed on Lin Yun. He had no opportunity to escape at all.

“So what if you’re Flower Burial? I can still kill you if I want! I’m from the noble Demonspirit Clan!” After losing the Stalemater Sword, Xiao Jingyan was much weaker, even with his Demonspirit’s physique. But he was still strong and confident in his strength.

Xiao Jingyan suddenly stood up, his vertical eye filled with demonic radiance, and his nails became sharp. His clothes burst apart with demonic runes covering his body, and his severed arm was restored. Relying on his terrifying recovering ability, Xiao Jingyan charged Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun saw that Xiao Jingyan wanted to fight with his life on the line, he charged toward him. It could be troublesome if Xiao Jingyan wanted to flee, and he might even be forced to bring out the Sovereign Saint Artifact. But Xiao Jingyan was simply courting death since he wanted to charge at him.

“A good opportunity!” Xiao Jingyan rejoiced when he saw that Lin Yun had no intentions of dodging. Lin Yun probably had no idea about how powerful the Demonspirit’s physique was. As long as he could get close, he could exhaust Lin Yun by fighting with his life on the line, and it was futile, even if Lin Yun possessed the Astral Sword Intent.

But his smile froze the next moment as a silver radiance bloomed from Lin Yun’s chest. His Azure Dragon Sword Heart spread out, and the radius of a hundred feet was enveloped in the silver radiance.

Xiao Jingyan didn’t know what had happened. When Lin Yun released his sword heart, Xiao Jingyan looked at Lin Yun with shock because it felt like he was facing a saint. His movements were slow, and he was ten meters away from Lin Yun. He could easily cross this distance with a step, but his movements were slow.

Before he could find a way to resolve the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, Lin Yun divided himself into twelve afterimages, with each afterimage swinging out a sword directed at Xiao Jingyan’s forehead. That was the Divine Firefly Sword—Myriad Swords Unite.

As Xiao Jingyan’s forehead caved in, black demonic blood seeped out from his forehead, and he was sent flying away. The outcome of the battle was determined in the blink of an eye. If Xiao Jingyan still had the Stalewater Sword, he could naturally exchange dozens or up to a hundred moves. He could leave whenever he wanted, even when Lin Yun brought out the Astral Sword Intent and Azure Dragon Sword Heart.

But with his vital struck by Lin Yun, he would die even if he had nine lives.

“This is impossible! How can you be so strong?!” Xiao Jingyan panicked with his face changing. This was the first time he felt so close to death, and he suddenly ducked to the side by instinct when he sensed danger. When he touched his neck, his back was covered in a cold sweat because he would lose his head if he was slightly slower.

But that wasn’t all, as Lin Yun charged again with his Astral Sword Intent, he relied on the Azure Dragon Sword Heart to suppress Xiao Jingyan while endlessly unleashing his attacks.

Xiao Jingyan could feel that he was enveloped in sword rays and couldn’t resist. He could only try his best to dodge the incoming attacks.

Three moves later, Xiao Jingyan’s head was sent flying away with his headless corpse falling to the ground before his head was stuck in a tree. But even so, Xiao Jingyan was still alive and said, “As expected of Flower Burial, you truly deserve your reputation. But even so, you can’t kill me!”

When he was finished, fine cracks appeared on his head as the vertical eye grew even brighter. His head was like a container that sealed him, and his main body was the vertical eye on his forehead.

“You talk a lot.” Lin Yun squinted his eyes, and the Flower Burial Sword flew out, stabbing Xiao Jingyan’s forehead and pinning him to the ground.

But even if Xiao Jingyan was bleeding from his seven orifices, he was still laughing, “Hahaha! How can someone like you possibly understand the greatness of the Demonspirit Clan? Even if you can stab through our spirit origin, I can still revive after ten to a hundred years! At that time, what can you do to me?!”

Xiao Jingyan laughed manically. His head was sinister, but it still contained powerful vitality.

“Still trying to be stubborn? Since I dare to reveal my identity, I naturally have the confidence to kill you. I have three ways of making you suffer worse than death, but scum like you is better off dead.” Lin Yun circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. As nether energy circulated within his body, he began to form seals and the nether energy between heaven and earth formed into ancient shackles with countless natal runes engraved on them.

“Nether Shackles!” Xiao Jingyan widened his pupils and exclaimed in horror, “No! You can’t do that! Lin Yun, you can’t do this! ARRGGGHHHH!”

The shackles pierced Xiao Jingyan’s forehead, causing the latter to scream out in fear. “Why!? The Blue Dragon has long abandoned the Kunlun Realm, so why are you people still resisting? WHY!?”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xiao Jingyan’s heart was filled with despair. The Nether Shackles were one of the banes of Demonspirits in the Darkest Era, and it was a seal more terrifying than death. If a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was sealed, not even their soul could dissipate, and that was worse than death.

Sweat began to appear on Lin Yun’s forehead. It was more exhausting to execute the Nether Shackles than he had imagined. But he could now deal with Xiao Jingyan by relying on this restriction.

Lin Yun took out the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads and poured his nirvana aura into them. Whenever he waved the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads, Xiao Jingyan would let out a scream with black miasma leaking out from his forehead, which the Flower Burial Sword stabbed.

In just ten breaths, Xiao Jingyan’s head lost its vitality. But Lin Yun still summoned the Black Tortoise Chains to wrap around the head with nine-colored sacred flames blazing on the chains.

As sacred flames spread out, the shriveled head opened its eyes. Xiao Jingyan screamed, “Lin Yun, I curse you! I curse you to suffer worse than death! Just wait! One fine day, my Demonspirit Clan will descend into the Kunlun Realm, and this day won’t be far away! At that time, your friends and lovers will be enslaved by us! You, people, will be kept as livestock! The Blue Dragon has left, so why aren’t you guys submitting to us!”

When the sacred flames poured in, the head was reduced to ashes, and the demonic eye disappeared.

After recalling the Black Tortoise Chains, Lin Yun grabbed the Flower Burial Sword and sighed, “The Demonspirit Clan is really hard to kill…”

If it was just inflicting heavy injuries, it wasn’t tough. But the difficulty of killing them was great.

“Otherwise, why do you think they could wreak havoc in the Kunlun Realm for a hundred thousand years?” Lil’ Purple said.

“I once saw the Demonspirits hunt on the Demon-Refining Tree like dogs at the ancient White Dragon Palace, where I got the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella from,” Lin Yun said.

“That should be before the Blue Dragon left,” Lil’ Purple said.

Blue Dragon? Is she referring to the Blue Dragon Ancestral God? Everyone waited for him in the ancient battle, but the Blue Dragon Ancestral God was nowhere to be seen.

Lin Yun suddenly thought of Yu Haotian, whom he killed back on the Heavenly Path. Yu Haotian should have a Demonspirit’s soul within his body. If Demonspirits were that tough to kill, doesn’t that mean that Yu Haotian…

Yu Haotian was the strongest opponent Lin Yun faced before arriving in the Kunlun Realm, and he had never encountered such a troublesome opponent amongst those of the same generation in the Kunlun Realm.

“What are you thinking about?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Nothing much.” Lin Yun shook his head. Even if Yu Haotian was still alive, Lin Yun wouldn’t mind killing him again if Yu Haotian dared to appear before him. But Yu Haotian should be dead because Lin Yun witnessed his vitality disappearing, and he didn’t have a demonic eye on his forehead.

“Time to resolve someone else.” Lin Yun’s body flickered and disappeared.

An hour later, Lin Yun caught up with the Indigocloth Venerable. He left a strand of sword intent within the Indigocloth Venerable’s body, so Lin Yun could easily find her no matter how she tried to escape. Indigocloth Venerable’s existence was no different from a flame in the darkness in the Myriad Graves Valley.

When the Indigocloth Venerable saw Lin Yun, she felt despair but wasn’t surprised. She had already guessed something when Lin Yun let her leave. It was just as she had expected. She begged, “Lin Yun, spare my life. I’m willing to swear that I won’t disclose your identity!”

“Do you think that I’ll believe you?” Lin Yun said.

“I will take you as my lord and become your slave. I’ll do whatever you tell me!” The Indigocloth Venerable went down on her knees and even intentionally showed her lofty figure. She smiled, “I’m willing to serve you.”

Lin Yun coldly looked at the Indigocloth Venerable without changing his face.

This instantly made the Indigocloth Venerable anxious as she said, “Let me go. The holy maiden said that if you’re willing to let me go, she’ll tell you the secret of the Solar Lunar Divine Rune. It’s related to Bai Shuying’s life and death!”

Lin Yun was surprised, and his face changed when he heard that.

Seeing that Lin Yun caught the bait, the Indigocloth Venerable rejoiced. The holy maiden said to disclose this when her life was in danger, and it could ensure her safety.

“Flower Burial is really someone who cherishes relationships. I’m grateful for not killing me,” the Indigocloth Venerable smiled, and she slowly retreated. But her smile soon froze when she saw Lin Yun sheathing his sword. She began to wonder when he drew it.

The Indigocloth Venerable rubbed her neck. As blood gushed out, her head was sent flying away. Didn’t the holy maiden say it could save my life? So why? Her pupils were wide open as she started dying an uncontented death.

“I hate people using women to threaten me the most,” Lin Yun said indifferently. The Indigocloth Venerable had violated his taboo, and she was too naive to think she could live.
