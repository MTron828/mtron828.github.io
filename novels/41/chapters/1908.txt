Chapter 1909 - Ye Feifan's Scheme

Chen Zhong never expected Lin Yun, who he looked at with disdain, would catch the attention of two holy maidens. He and the other saint disciples were shocked as they looked over. One asked him to come while the other told him not to go.

But Lin Yun didn’t move and pretended not to hear what they said. He wasn’t surprised by the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden because the latter wanted to place him on the grill. She had ill intentions and wanted to force him to reveal Ye Qingtian’s secrets. On the other hand, he could roughly guess Bai Shuying’s intentions.

Lin Yun turned to look at Ouyang He, who intensely fought on the painting. He was meticulous, and he could tell that cultivation didn’t matter in this trial. Ouyang He’s opponent had the same cultivation as him, and he had to rely on his attainment in the sword to win. This meant the challenger had to win with their strength against the gatekeeper in the same cultivation.

He quickly noticed something. Ouyang He’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent had reached lesser mastery. But that wasn’t all; his lightning intent was more terrifying and domineering than his sword. Not to mention Ouyang He had merged the two perfectly. Then again, Lin Yun was surprised that Ouyang He mainly cultivated lightning intent, and sword intent was just a supplementary.

So when the two intents merged, it was more terrifying than Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at greater mastery. Most importantly, Ouyang He also practiced the Divine Firefly Sword. What his master said was right, this sword technique was pretty common in the holy lands, and it was one of the main sword techniques that all swordsmen practiced.

Although Ouyang He was older than him, Lin Yun could feel a wisp of pressure coming from him. The Heavenly Dao Sect was different from the outside world.

Ouyang He managed to resolve his opponent after a hundred moves. He turned around to look at Chen Zhong before continuing, “I’ll wait for you at the summit!”

A wave of fragrance swept over, and the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden came to Lin Yun’s side without anyone knowing it. She looked at Ouyang He and smiled, “Ouyang He’s master is the Lightning Saint Sovereign. This is why his attainment in lightning is so terrifying.”

“Junior Sister Muyan, are you determined to make me the public enemy?” Lin Yun sighed. After knowing Wang Muyan’s identity, he also knew that she was only nineteen years old, and she had a habit of making others call her ‘Big Sister’.

“Don’t you know that I love you the most? I have already noticed that you’re the most special out of everyone,” Wang Muyan said in a grudging tone.

“Your taste is really special,” Lin Yun smiled.

Wang Muyan smiled, and whispered in Lin Yun’s ears, “You better tell me honestly what’s happened with Ye Qingtian. Otherwise, Big Sister won’t let you off.”

When Wang Muyan whispered in his ears, Lin Yun could sense several sharp gazes directed at him. Those were probably Wang Muyan’s admirers, and they were all unhappy to see Ye Qingtian being so close to Wang Muyan.

But what surprised him was that it was not only the men who were looking at him unhappily, even Bai Shuying was coldly looking at him, and he could even sense a wisp of murderous intent within her pupils.

Lin Yun sighed and roughly knew why Bai Shuying would respond this way. After all, he was so sincere before entering the Celestial Purging Mountain, but then he was getting together with the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden in the blink of an eye. Even if Bai Shuying had no feelings for him, it wouldn’t prevent her from becoming unhappy.

But others could only see that Ye Qingtian had become the center of attention of two holy maidens, one like an iceberg and the other like a volcano. Bai Shuying’s face was cold, and she immediately closed her eyes to meditate.

When Ye Feifan looked at Lin Yun, he couldn’t conceal the jealousy within his heart. He walked over and smiled, “Ye Qingtian, I heard you shone brightly on the conferring ceremony, grasping the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at the Profound Death Stage. Why don’t you challenge two paintings? Anyhow, this trial has nothing to do with the cultivation.”

When he said that, all the saint disciples turned to look at Ye Qingtian. There was no question that Ye Qingtian was talented in the sword since he could grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at the Profound Death Stage. But they all knew that Ye Feifan had no good intentions by saying that.

This trial might have nothing to do with the cultivation, but it was undeniable that cultivation was the foundation. Without a powerful cultivation, you wouldn’t be able to unleash the full power of your sword attainment, even if you’re talented. Even if you put the cultivation aside, the Nirvana Stage was the minimum. After all, there was a massive difference between the nirvana aura and the profound death aura.

“Ye Feifan clearly has no good intentions. He obviously wants Ye Qingtian’s death!”

“They’re both from the same clan, so why is he so disgusting?”

“Ye Qingtian used to be a piece of garbage, and no one was fond of him in the Ye Clan. Not to mention he became so cocky when he returned.”

“If he fell, he would probably fall harder than a year ago.”

“Ye Feifan is clearly jealous that two holy maidens are paying attention to Ye Qingtian.”

“Isn’t that obvious? Who isn’t jealous? That’s two holy maidens we’re talking about!”

Discussions resounded from the surroundings, and all the saint disciples found that Ye Qingtian was standing out too much and was about to be conned by Ye Feifan.

“The more paintings, the more rewards, right?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s for certain!” Ye Feifan said. “Challenging one painting can obtain a three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit, and your reward will multiply tenfold if you challenge another. If you can challenge ten paintings, you can obtain 90% of the three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits at the summit.”

Lin Yun was concerned about the Heavenly Cloud Fruits. After all, the effects of the three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits must be ten times better than those on the first level. So if they were four-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits, their effects would be much better.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Let’s give it a try, then,” Lin Yun said with a light flashing across his pupils.

“If you fail, you will not be able to continue but suffer serious injuries. You might not be able to recover in time for the ranking battle,” the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden said.

Ye Feifan squinted his pupils and smiled, “As expected of my Ye Clan’s rising star. A Great Saint’s disciple is definitely better than us and should challenge two paintings, unlike us.”

“When did I say that I wanted to challenge two paintings?” Lin Yun turned to look at Ye Feifan.

But just when Ye Feifan was about to speak, Lin Yun said, “I want to challenge three paintings.”

When he was done, he ignored everyone’s shocked gazes and continued forth, leaving everyone looking at him with disbelief.

“Is this fellow insane?!”

“He’s courting death! He’s a madman!”

“Why go that far when he can get through this trial with one painting?”

“I was just taking pity on him a while ago, but it looks like he’s courting death now.” All the saint disciples shook their heads with disdain filling their pupils.

Ye Feifan was briefly stunned, before he smiled, “Hahaha—No wonder you’re the disciple of a Great Saint. I’m impressed by your courage!”

He praised Ye Qingtian. This way, if Ye Qingtian fails, not only would he suffer severe injuries, but Ye Feifan could step on and humiliate him.

Everyone present could see through Ye Feifan’s intentions. So they looked at Ye Qingtian as though they were looking at a fool.

“Three paintings? He must be dreaming!” Ye Feifan sneered.

The junior brothers from the Dao Yang Palace beside him looked at Ye Qingtian with disbelief. They began to wonder if Ye Qingtian had gone mad.

Even Chen Zhong began to wonder what the holy maidens saw in Ye Qingtian. Was it just because he was blessed with a good appearance?

A Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciple smiled, “That fellow has always been cocky, and he will fall one day because of his cockiness.”

Lin Yun leaped to the sky. When he landed down, he was a hundred meters away from those paintings, and he said, “I want to challenge three paintings.”

As a saint radiance descended, three paintings unfolded and formed a massive stage. Lin Yun gently tapped his foot on the ground and flew to the stage. As ripples spread out on the stage, three figures simultaneously appeared and charged towards Lin Yun; when they swung their swords, the wind from their swords formed into ferocious beasts.

“It’s the Ghost Howler!” All the saint disciples took a deep breath at this scene. This was their first time seeing something like this, and they were briefly shocked before their facial expression became grave.

“It looks like it’s not that easy to obtain the Heavenly Cloud Fruits,” Lin Yun sighed. He soon noticed something unusual about this when he dashed forth. The cultivation of the three gatekeepers was higher than his, and they were all at the pinnacle seventh channel of the Profound Death Stage. Aside from that, the beasts created by their swords even suppressed the dragon aura of his saint physique.

But just when the sword aura was about to devour Lin Yun, a shocking scene occurred as Lin Yun drew his sword with a dazzling shine, destroying all the incoming swords. He was executing the Firefly Radiance of the Divine Firefly Sword. Lin Yun wielded the Flower Burial Sword and stepped forth, circulating the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra and forcing two gatekeepers to retreat.

“Dawn Radiance!” Lin Yun gently pricked with the Flower Burial Sword, and the darkness within the surroundings was lifted. Two gatekeepers were severed into two in the next second before landing on the ground. With that, Lin Yun only had one opponent left.

Dashing forth, his sword danced and forced the remaining opponent to retreat. But Lin Yun didn’t let his opponent go that easily. He formed a seal with one hand before spinning the Flower Burial Sword, and a head flew out. With that, Lin Yun had defeated all three gatekeepers of this trial.

“The Divine Firefly Sword!” Ye Feifan exclaimed upon seeing this, and his eyes bulged out. He couldn’t believe what he saw. It was just a year, but a piece of garbage in his eyes managed to learn the Divine Firefly Sword.

“He has reached the manifestation stage in the two sword forms…” Chen Zhong took a cold breath.

Many people practiced the Divine Firefly Sword, but only a few could reach the manifestation stage.
