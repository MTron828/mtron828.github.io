Chapter 2261 - Assault From The Demonic Cult

Ji Zixi was truly breathtaking. Her beauty had suppressed all the females present, as well as the temperament of the men present. The moment she appeared, it was as though she had become the center of the world.

Even Huang Jingyu was briefly stunned when he saw Ji Zixi. But he soon came to his senses and smiled, “Your Highness is more breathtaking than before. In a few more years, I’m afraid you will overshadow the other two beauties of the Kunlun Realm.”

Hearing what Huang Jingyu said, Lin Yun smiled, “Ji Zixi is going to be furious.”

“What?” Li Feibai looked at Lin Yun in bafflement.

Lin Yun smiled, “Ji Zixi hates people calling her a princess. Continue watching if you don’t believe me.”

After Ji Zixi heard what Huang Jingyu said, her face sank and became cold. She quickly ignored Huang Jingyu and walked over to the restriction.

This placed Huang Jingyu in an awkward position, but he soon followed behind Ji Zixi after being comforted by everyone else. The moment they moved, all the holy lands and saint clans in the surrounding area also moved, heading to the heart of the Flame Dragon Valley.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The center of the Flame Dragon Valley was where the Flame Dragon’s skull was located, and it was in ruins. The cold here was terrifying and many Saint Lords couldn’t bear the cold as they got closer to it.

The ruins had damaged stone pillars erected along with broken walls and rocks. The restriction was here, and there was a black monument at the center of the ruins, which was where the restriction was located.

The stone monument gave off a terrifying yin energy that required a powerful yang energy to destroy the restriction and retrieve the divine flame fragments underneath.

There were traces of flames around the stone monument, indicating that many Saint Lords have tried before, but their attempts have failed. This was why they thought of Ji Zixi, wanting to use her Phoenix Fire to melt the stone monument and retrieve the divine flame fragments.

There were over a few hundred people gathered around. They were all from Ancient Saint Clans and powerful sects of the Eastern Desolation. Everyone was nervous because deities were gone from the Kunlun Realm. Although everyone had some storage of divine blood, divine flames were rare, and not even holy lands had them.

“We should go over as well.” Lin Yun and Li Feibai started to approach the ruins. Since everyone’s attention was on the restriction, no one had paid any attention to them.

“How can it be that easy to obtain the divine flames?” Li Feibai muttered. She came from one of the Eight Imperial Clans and knew many secrets regarding the divine flames.

Hearing what Li Feibai said, Lin Yun turned his attention to her.

Li Feibai explained, “The divine flames will shatter upon a deity's death and dissipate throughout the world over time. Since the Annihilation God Lord’s divine flame fragments have been preserved, there must be other reasons.”

Lin Yun’s face changed upon hearing the Annihilation God Lord’s name because that deity’s hand bone was down in the Fallen God Valley.

“Does that deity have a huge origin?” Lin Yun asked.

“He has a huge origin. Each clan has ancient records that have bits and pieces about him. He slew countless invaders and was a famous deity in the Kunlun Realm. He had grasped the Annihilation Dao and was proficient in various sacred flames…the Flame Dragon was his mount when it was alive,” Li Feibai explained.

Lin Yun and Li Feibai mixed into the crowd and soon came near the ruins. When they got close, they immediately sensed a chill coming from the surroundings.

“Your Highness, please make your move.” Huang Jingyu was unhappy with how Ji Zixi ignored him earlier but still politely spoke to her.

Ji Zixi had no choice but to join forces with the holy lands to obtain the divine flame fragment. The Divine Phoenix Mountain might’ve made a lot of preparations, but they didn’t know what would happen the moment the divine flames appeared.

Just when Ji Zixi was going to use her phoenix fire, a commotion resounded as the Saints sent by the five holy lands to guard the surroundings were sent flying back. Shortly after, the array they set up was forcibly broken by someone.

The moment the array broke, moonlight shone in and illuminated the surroundings. When moonlight shone in, it was accompanied by a powerful saint aura that baffled everyone. Didn’t the demonic cultivators retreat?

The faces of the Saints in the surrounding area changed as they raised their heads and saw four people descending from the sky. They each gave off a powerful, baleful energy and didn’t bother containing their auras. The four figures landed on the skull of the Flame Dragon, looking down at everyone.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he recognized three of the four. The one standing in the middle was the Blood Moon Divine Son Zhao Tianyu, followed by the Demonspirit Clan’s Ying River King. They were accompanied by an expert from the Demonspirit Clan and the Blood Moon Sect.

Lin Yun didn’t recognize the other Demonspirit Clan expert, but he recognized the one from the Blood Moon Sect, Gu Xinyu. This person was a genius of the Blood Moon Sect who nearly became the champion of the Blue Dragon Record. On the ninth, he was saved by Wang Muyan with the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

After appearing again, Lin Yun noticed that he had become a Saint. This meant that he must’ve received a lot of opportunities with Zhao Tianyu in the Heavenly Void. He no longer looked as tattered as before, looking arrogant and domineering.

“The Blood Moon Sect!”

“These people just don’t know when to give up!” Someone recognized Zhao Tianyu’s identity.

Zhao Tianyu had an amicable smile and didn’t look like someone from the demonic sect. But he gave off a powerful aura, accompanied by a powerful pressure. As for the Ying River King beside him, this person was even more unfathomable.

Their appearance caused an uproar since the holy lands were about to lift the restriction, but had now become alert.

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by their arrival but was curious about where Wang Muyan was. Things would become troublesome if Wang Muyan could use the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda in the Heavenly Void.

“Zhao Tianyu, how dare you!” Huang Jingyu roared. He was a second-stage Saint Lord now, with his strength undergoing a drastic transformation. He easily intimidated the demonic cultivators earlier and didn’t place the four of them in his eyes.

“We’re naturally here to watch as a treasure like the divine flame fragments appear. I’m not afraid to tell you that this place was discovered by the divine son first,” Gu Xinyu said, looking at Huang Jingyu.

Huang Jingyu’s face was cold, and he sneered, “Just the four of you want to confront our five holy lands?”

Huang Jingyu looked arrogant, with fighting spirits filling his eyes.

Zhao Tianyu and the Ying River King exchanged a gaze, before they both smiled with disdain in their waves of laughter. Zhao Tianyu said, “Gu Xinyu, you go fight him.”

“That’s what I intended to do.” Gu Xinyu sinisterly smiled as he jumped off the Flame Dragon’s skull.

This made Huang Jingyu’s heart sink. But an old man came beside him just when he was about to move. This person was a Saint Elder of the Ming Cult, known as the Firmament Feather Saint Lord, with a cultivation at the pinnacle third-stage Saint Lord. He said, “Young Master, leave someone like him to me.”

He might have yet to reach the fourth stage, but he practiced the Sun-Moon Saint Canon. He had a sturdy foundation and was stronger than most demonic cultivators. With a gentle wave, he summoned his constellation with a massive ‘Ming’ word appearing from him, before forming a dazzling saint armor.

This was the signature move of the Ming Cult, the Trigram Saint Armor. But this wasn’t simple. There was a sun and moon on it, sending ripples into the surrounding air as they revolved.

This scene made everyone’s eyes light up, but the Ying River King sneered from the Flame Dragon’s skull.

“What pitiful tricks!” Gu Xinyu laughed. He was only a first-stage Saint Lord, but the aura he gave off was powerful. When he threw a punch forth, he easily sent the Firmament Feather Saint Lord flying away.

“The Sun-Moon Saint Canon is nothing compared to the Blood Moon Divine Canon!” Gu Xinyu sneered as a crimson moon appeared on him that shone brightly. Under the suppression of the crimson moon, the moonlight that the Firmament Feather Saint Lord gave off became dim.

The Firmament Feather Saint Lord was furious as he dashed forth after regaining his footing. But Gu Xinyu reached him first, and the Firmament Feather Saint Lord could only struggle while facing his opponent. They were fast and only left behind blurred figures in the air.

In a brief moment, the Firmament Feather Saint Lord and Gu Xinyu had exchanged over ten-odd moves with various phenomena appearing in the surrounding air. With another clash, the Firmament Feather Saint Lord threw out a mouthful of blood and the saint radiance that he gave off was extinguished. When they clashed again for the last time, the Firmament Feather Saint Lord was sent flying away and had fainted.

On the other hand, Gu Xinyu hovered in the air, releasing a crimson radiance while looking around. He might only be a first-stage Saint Lord, but his aura was even more powerful than a third-stage Saint Lord, making everyone feel a chill.

“That’s the Blood Shadow Arm!”

“It’s a long-lost martial technique. How did he manage to practice it?”

“It’s no wonder why the Heavenly Feather Saint Lord lost.” The fight between the two might be fast, and many people couldn’t observe the fight clearly, but they recognized the dragon spirit martial technique that Gu Xinyu used.

The moment Gu Xinyu attacked, hundreds of blood shadows formed into an arm that swiftly defeated the Firmament Feather Saint Lord. Everything happened too quickly, especially when the blood shadows overlapped at the end. They had easily shattered the Firmament Feather Saint Lord’s dipper energy and his constellation. Based on the Firmament Feather Saint Lord's injuries, it would take at least half a year for him to recover.

“Is this the best the Ming Cult has to offer?” Gu Xinyu smiled. “You guys might as well give up on the divine flames if this is the best you can do.”

The Eastern Desolation’s five holy lands were stumped while many people were looking at Gu Xinyu with lingering fear in their eyes. A youth forced them into such a pathetic state without the Blood Moon Divine Son making a move.

They might have the advantage in numbers, but they couldn’t suppress the other party with their aura. This meant that it wouldn’t be easy for them to obtain the divine flame fragments and could only yield in the end.

“How powerful…” Li Feibai muttered. She pondered that if she didn’t bring out her Sovereign Constellation, it might be a problem for her to defeat Gu Xinyu.

Lin Yun was also shocked by the great boost in Gu Xinyu’s strength. He began to wonder how strong Zhao Tianyu had become. Thinking about it, he sneaked a peek at Zhao Tianyu. He had a feeling that the latter came prepared, not to mention that Wang Muyan might be somewhere in the surrounding area.

“Let me play with you, then!” The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord spoke out with a purple light shining from his eyes.
