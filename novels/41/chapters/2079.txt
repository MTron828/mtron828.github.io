Chapter 2080: More Troubles (2)

When Feng Wuji came to his senses, he was a little furious as he looked at Lin Yun. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Lin Yun carried on with a smile, “If Manor Master has that intention, you can contact me any time. I only need to borrow it for a year.”

“Do you think I’ll believe you?” Feng Wuji asked.

“It doesn’t matter if you believe me or not. What about my reward?” Lin Yun asked.

“What reward?” Feng Wuji asked.

“The Heavenly Dipper Sword and the pellets for being champion of the Sword Assembly. I already said three days ago that I wanted them all,” Lin Yun replied.

Feng Wuji took a deep breath because Ye Qingtian was really cocky to still think about his rewards.

“It’ll take some time to reforge the Heavenly Dipper Sword. You can wait for half a month here,” Feng Wuji gritted his teeth.

“Get someone to deliver it to the Heavenly Dao Sect, then. I’ll bid my farewell,” Lin Yun said and left, not giving Feng Wuji any time to consider. He wanted to leave quickly with the Cauldron Sword in his hands. As for the Heavenly Dragon Seal and the rewards, they weren’t that important to him right now.

The Cauldron Sword was too important, and it was a hot potato. Lin Yun didn’t want to stay here for another moment.

“Ye Qingtian…” The Indigothunder Peak Master looked in disbelief at the Cauldron Sword in Ye Qingtian’s hand. He never expected that Ye Qingtian would really manage to borrow the Cauldron Sword in his dreams, nor that Ye Qingtian’s name would spread throughout the Kunlun Realm because of it.

“Let’s leave first,” Lin Yun gave the Indigothunder Peak Master a look.

“Okay.” The Indigothunder Peak Master came to his sense and they sped up, leaving before everyone could accept that the Cauldron Sword was being lent to Ye Qingtian.

“Perhaps you can try giving him the Heavenly Dragon Seal,” Feng Yu’s voice resounded in Feng Wuji’s ears when the latter was looking at Lin Yun’s back.

Feng Yu continued, “Big Brother, perhaps such a sovereign constellation really exists. Even the old man showed up earlier, and he might’ve noticed something.”

“Is that true?” Feng Wuji asked.

“Most likely. Otherwise, why do you think the old man would change his mind so quickly?” Feng Yu replied with a question.

Feng Wuji fell into deep thoughts. If they could grasp the secret of that sovereign constellation, it wouldn’t be a loss for them to loan the Heavenly Dragon Seal. Furthermore, it was just for a year, and he wasn’t afraid that Ye Qingtian wouldn’t return it with the Hidden Sword Manor’s foundation.

But he suddenly came to his senses because if it was a lie, he would’ve loaned the Sovereign Saint Sword and Heavenly Dragon Seal away for nothing. He lowered his voice and asked, “Third Young Sister, what’s your relationship with him?”

It was too unusual because Feng Yu was too good to that brat. Perhaps she came back to the Hidden Sword Manor for him. But one must know that Feng Yu was someone that not even the old man could tame.

“What relationship can we possibly have?” Feng Yu smiled. She naturally wouldn’t tell Feng Wuji that Ye Qingtian was Lin Yun, nor that Lin Yun was her junior brother.

.

“Don’t tell me…” Feng Wuji thought of a possibility, and his face changed.

“What?” Feng Yu’s face blushed.

Feng Wuji lowered his voice and asked, “He’s not your son, right?”

“You!” Feng Yu furiously glared at Feng Wuji before he left.

Can it be that I’m really right? The more Feng Wuji thought about it, the more he found that speculation was possible. If Ye Qingtian was really Feng Yu’s son, it was understandable why he had such a high talent for the sword.

If that was the case, it wasn’t exactly a loss to the Feng Clan to loan the Cauldron Sword to Ye Qingtian. After all, the sword was still in the hands of the Feng Clan’s bloodline.

While Zhao Wuji looked at Ye Qingtian’s back figure from the palace, his gaze was vicious, and his face was terrifyingly dark.

Compared to him, Jiang Yunting and Gu Zijing were calmer since they were still shocked by Ye Qingtian’s talent in sword dao.

“What a pity that we didn’t manage to see the complete Divine Firefly Sword,” Gu Zijing sighed.

Jiang Yunting nodded, “I really wanted to see the true profundity of the Divine Firefly Sword in his eyes.”

Gu Zijing smiled, “But this trip was also worth it to witness dual sword stars.”

“It’s too easy to satisfy you. Ye Qingtian said he had at least three ways to defeat Feng Shaoyu, and I’m really curious about the other two methods,” Jiang Yunting said.

While Jiang Yunting and Gu Zijing were discussing amongst themselves, they felt that this trip was worth it. Although they lost to Ye Qingtian during the Sword Assembly, they were fully convinced by their losses.

“You two can still smile even after losing the Cauldron Sword? Who knows how cocky he’ll become in the future,” Zhao Wuji said in disdain.

“It’s impossible for him to use the sword himself. The Heavenly Dao Sect has a Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, so the sword will surely be handed to her,” Gu Zijing said. “With the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s position, she is worthy of the Cauldron Sword. In the future when the Hidden Sword Manor is in trouble, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint definitely won’t stand and watch. So there’s no need to keep dwelling in it.”

This had always been what the Hidden Sword Manor was doing all along, which was why the Hidden Sword Manor had such appeal. But this time, the sword wasn’t loaned to someone who was in the Sword Alliance but to an outsider, instead.

“Hmph, that’s under the circumstances that he can?return with the sword,” Zhao Wuji snorted. He ignored the two and swept his gaze over with a few people following him.

Jiang Yunting and Gu Zijing exchanged a glance. Jiang Yunting said, “It looks like this matter hasn’t ended yet. It might not be easy for Ye Qingtian to return the sword, and there might be more trouble.”

Gu Zijing calmly said, “Zhao Wuji has a feud with him, and he definitely won’t let this matter rest. But we just have to wait and watch. Since Ye Qingtian dared to come for the sword, he must have confidence. It’s fine if Zhao Wuji bears it down, but if he can’t hold back, I bet not even an immortal can save him.”
