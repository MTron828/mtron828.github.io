Chapter 1684 – Heavenly Domain City!

Lin Wan smiled, but her smile looked somewhat sad, and she sighed, “Let’s not talk about that. Not even the Radiant Sword Saint can protect him from the responsibility on his shoulders. We can only treat him as a dead person, even if he's talented. What do you think, Young Master Lin?”

“Perhaps.” Lin Yun wasn’t sure if Lin Wan had a hidden meaning to her words, so he could only give her a vague answer.

“It’s getting late. So you should go and rest, Young Master Lin.” After briefly chatting, Lin Wan bade her farewell.

Nodding his head, Lin Yun continued to ponder what Lin Wan had said earlier. Whether she meant it or not, she had no problem with what she said. Even if he was alive, he could only be treated as dead. No matter what, he couldn’t move around with his original identity anytime soon.

After returning to his room, Lin Yun took out the Divine Blood Fruit. Swallowing a leaf, he started his cultivation. Before regaining his cultivation, he could only be equivalent to sixth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses who were from a sect, based on his current strength.

A wandering cultivator and a cultivator from a sect were two different concepts. For example, a genius like Qin Tian could fight wandering cultivators at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm when he was at the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Lin Yun could hold his ground against a seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm wandering cultivator based on his current strength.

Then again, it was a different story for those old monsters that were a few centuries old. Those people didn’t have much potential left, but that didn’t mean they were weak, since they had stayed in the Dragon Pulse Realm for centuries.

At the heart of the Eastern Desolation, the holy land’s geniuses could be found there, not to mention the powerful sects’ geniuses. This was why Lin Yun had no intention of hiding the Divine Blood Fruit’s leaves any longer. He planned to refine all the leaves before arriving at Heavenly Domain City.

An hour later, Lin Yun opened his eyes with light shining across his pupils. The Divine Blood Fruit was too powerful, and the leaves alone could bring him endless benefits just by refining them. This was his second time refining the leaves, and he could feel that it wouldn’t take long for his cultivation as a Saint Spiritualist to reach the fourth grade.

He still needed roughly three days before he could finish refining this leaf. At that time, his cultivation as a Saint Spiritualist would definitely be able to reach the fourth grade, and he could also try and make a breakthrough in the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art.

Aside from his cultivation and sword intent, the Divine Blood Fruit’s leaves could significantly boost his strength. The leaves also replenished his vitality. His vitality had been incredibly exhausted when he used the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and Firmament Saint Cloth, but it was now replenished.

“Let’s aim for the fifth grade as a Saint Spiritualist before entering Heavenly Domain City. I can also try and reach the second stage in the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art.” Lin Yun muttered.

Recollecting his thoughts, he retrieved the Thunderstorm Zither. As the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix Saint Runes shined in his profound palace, he gently placed his hands on the zither and closed his eyes.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to be completely submerged within it. As he poured his soul energy into the Thunderstorm Zither, he soon appeared in a dark space filled with two elemental energies. This was a world forged with wind and lightning. It was as though there was an ancient existence here, and that ancient existence had awakened from its slumber when Lin Yun prepared to go deeper into the Thunderstorm Zither. Lin Yun’s soul energy was thrown out of the zither when that existence awakened.

“What is this?” Lin Yun opened his eyes. It felt as though he had seen a pair of eyes, and he was thrown out when that pair of eyes fell onto him.

Was that the dragon's soul? This made Lin Yun shocked and happy at the same time because he finally saw the dragon's soul that Lil’ Purple spoke of. But he was shocked because he didn’t receive the acknowledgment of that dragon’s soul.

“What should I do…?” Lin Yun held onto his chin. It was a waste if he couldn’t gain complete control of such a powerful treasure. Furthermore, it made no sense that he wasn’t acknowledged since the zither was given to him by the Azure Dragon Lord.

After a brief pondering, Lin Yun took out a dagger and opened a small gash on his finger. As the blood containing the Azure Dragon’s intent fell onto the zither, it started buzzing, and a piece of beautiful music resounded. The zither also gradually changed as the ancient runes on it emitted a faint glow.

His blood was like lines being drawn on the zither as the blood from his wound flowed. This lasted for half an incense of time, and Lin Yun had no idea how much blood he had lost. When everything ended, Lin Yun could only feel his mind spinning, and his face turned pale.

“Holy shit, I nearly lost half of my life.” Lin Yun held onto his forehead. After he recovered a little, his gaze fell back to the Thunderstorm Zither. There weren’t many changes to the appearance of the zither. But when he looked at it again, he could feel it was different from before.

With a wave of his hand, the Thunderstorm Zither that was placed on the table flew beneath his hands. His hands briefly paused on the zither before it started flying around like a sword.

“Stop!” With a raised hand, the Thunderstorm Zither stopped as per his command. He could control the zither as he wished and had it fly around the room.

With a light flashing across his pupils, he poured his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent into the Thunderstorm Zither. The Thunderstorm Zither shone with dazzling sword rays, like a mighty sword baring its fangs.

This made Lin Yun excited because this Thunderstorm Zither was a little powerful. But it was a pity this place wasn’t too suitable. If he was in the outside world, he could try and see the limit of this Thunderstorm Zither.

“Come here.” Lin Yun waved his hand. The Thunderstorm Zither hovered beneath his fingers, and he could feel a connection, just like he had with the Flower Burial Sword. When he strummed the zither, the zither music became even more ethereal.

There was a bizarre space within the zither, filled with wind and lightning energy. The wind was represented by white energy, and lightning was represented by indigo. The two energies filled every corner of this space, looking like a Yin-Yang symbol.

Wind. Lin Yun inwardly roared, and used his soul energy to manipulate the wind energy within the zither. As white wind energy flew out from Lin Yun’s fingers, it made his clothes and hair violently flutter within the wind. The musical notes turned into wind blades that were dancing in the wind.

As the wind blades left cracks in the surrounding space, Lin Yun inwardly roared, and terrifying lightning crackled on the surface of the zither that fluctuated.

When the wind and lightning were activated, the Yin-Yang symbol began to revolve. Lin Yun’s aura rose as it rotated, and a terrifying aura swept out from him. A massive Azure Dragon also gradually formed around the Yin-Yang symbol, which was the dragon’s soul.

The dragon’s soul was translucent, but it gradually became vivid as the Yin-Yang symbol revolved. Simultaneously, Lin Yun’s vitality and soul energy were swiftly being drained. He would require massive soul energy and vitality if he wanted to summon the dragon’s soul, but he wouldn’t be able to last long.

“This Thunderstorm Zither is really a treasure.” Lin Yun caressed the zither with joy reflected in his pupils. The dragon’s soul had never exhibited such power in the past. How powerful would the zither become if the dragon’s soul was fully summoned?

Lin Yun didn’t waste any time on the remaining journey to the Heavenly Domain City. He would spend the day refining the Divine Blood Fruit’s leaves and get familiar with the Thunderstorm Zither at night, along with the Phoenix Heart Song. When the ship was about to reach the Heavenly Domain City, Lin Yun finally came out of his room.

Half a month had passed, and Lin Yun’s soul energy had reached the height of a fourth-grade Saint Spiritualist. The dragon runes in the Blue Dragon Bone have reached ninety thousand, and he was just one step from reaching a hundred thousand.

Although he made no progress in his cultivation, his Azure Dragon Saint Physique and music dao had greatly improved. On this day, the Heavenly Note Sect’s ship was finally a few thousand miles away from the Heavenly Domain City.

Since they all had powerful cultivations, they could see the massive outline of the Heavenly Domain City when they raised their heads. The Heavenly Domain City was a city, and it was also an island at the same time. In ancient times, there were legends about a massive star hovering above the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. After that star shattered following the battle between deities, the star shattered into tens of thousands of islands that scattered across the sea, and the Heavenly Domain City was the largest fragment.

It was one-third of the entire star, and not only could precious treasures be found on the island, but the density of spiritual energy on the island was ten-odd times higher than the outside world. The density of spiritual energy and resources was comparable to a holy land.

Thus, many cultivators gathered here and transformed the island, building a city. So this was an undisputed saint city!
