Chapter 1955 - Senior Brother's Love

When the idea ‘soul and sword unite’ appeared within his mind, Lin Yun turned to look at the azure dragon helping him repelling the pressure from the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf. Lin Yun immediately came to a decision and roared, “Come back!”

The azure dragon flew back, entering the silver sword bead within his chest. At the same time, his Astral Sword Intent, which was suppressing the saint aura within his body, poured into the sword bead. This was a risky move. After all, he would be instantly suppressed by the Quasi-Saint’s aura when his domain disappeared. At that time, he would be blown apart before the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf moved without his Astral Sword Intent suppressing the saint aura within his body.

But everything was completed in the blink of an eye, with the azure dragon and Astral Sword Intent pouring into the silver sword bead, his Sword Heart. In a split second, the domain disappeared, and the saint aura within his body began to wreak havoc.

“Mhm?” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf was shocked to discover that the pressure on him had suddenly disappeared.

But before he could rejoice, Lin Yun’s Sword Heart shone brightly. It was even more dazzling than moonlight. The silver radiance enveloped every corner of this forest, and a boundless sword intent projected out of the Sword Heart before filling every corner of Lin Yun’s body like a tidal wave.

When the sword intent came in contact with the saint aura, the saint aura was instantly cleansed from within his body. When the silver sword intent filled his body, Lin Yun’s hair, clothes, eyes, skin, and flesh became silver. This made him look like a silver statue with a holy and mighty aura enveloping him.

The incoming attack from the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf was like slow motion and was broken down.

Lin Yun stomped on the ground and leaped into the sky, retreating. The entire process took place smoothly, making Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf’s attack miss and land on the ground with the surrounding space trembling as cracks spread up to ten miles away.

“How is this possible…?” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf was shocked. It was confident that this attack would land, especially when Lin Yun was severely injured.

“What a magical feeling… My sword intent is filling every corner of my body…” Lin Yun looked at his hands with his silver pupils filled with curiosity. His entire body was forged with Astral Sword Intent, and he had turned into a sword.

Soul and sword united. This was the meaning of soul and sword united.

As a faint vibration came from the surrounding space, Lin Yun raised his head to see the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf charging over. But Lin Yun merely glanced at it before he ducked the incoming attack with a flash, and his movement was close to teleportation. The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf couldn’t come in contact with him no matter how it tried.

The Divine Sunchasing Art is impressive, and my body feels much lighter. Wait… It’s not that my body has become lighter, but I have gained complete control of my body. My skin, flesh, limbs, and internal organs have become one. Lin Yun spread his arms apart and sensed the changes within his body.

“How dare you look down on me!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf flew into a rage, and the speed of its saint aura becoming rampant increased.

Lin Yun came to his senses and smiled. The Flower Burial Sword in his hand released a dazzling silver radiance and pierced through the palm of the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf.

“ARRGGGHHH!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf let out a painful howl, grimacing its teeth as it held onto its hand. When it looked at Lin Yun, its gaze became ferocious.

As the Flower Burial Sword returned to Lin Yun’s side, he didn’t grab it but muttered, “What will happen if I release this power?”

Would he be able to kill a Quasi-Saint? Lin Yun reached out. He placed his thumb down on his middle finger like a fully stretched bow with his sword intent and dragon origin accumulating within the Sword Heart.

The boundless energy flowed out and turned into a silver current, surging towards his finger.

Just when the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf wanted to take a step forth, it was blinded by a dazzling sword ray before it could respond in time.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When Lin Yun accumulated all the energy in his finger, it formed into a silver bead, swiftly expanding a thousand-fold when he flicked it. When the silver bead came in contact with the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf, the wolf was sent flying before it fell to the ground a few thousand meters away.

As for Lin Yun, he also collapsed on the ground like a broken kite, feeling powerless and couldn’t even move his finger. He was exhausted and couldn’t even muster a hint of strength from within his body. He couldn’t be bothered about anything else right now and wanted to have a good sleep.

The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf struggled back on its feet and was covered in wounds while slowly approaching Lin Yun. There was a massive hole with blood gushing out of its chest.

Lin Yun merely took a glance and could no longer be bothered about it. He couldn’t be bothered about that anymore as he was too exhausted.

As the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf limped and slowly approached Lin Yun, a man chewing on a fruit walked out with a smile. Ye Guhan raised his head and looked at the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf with a smile, “Wolfie, he’s my beloved brother, and I can’t allow you to kill him.”

“S-S-Saint Sovereign!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf began to stagger and immediately descended on its knees, kowtowing. “I didn’t know about your relationship with him, and I deserved to die. Please spare me…”

“You’re too polite. How can I possibly kill you when you helped my junior brother?” Ye Guhan smiled, carrying Lin Yun before slapping the back of his head and forcing the seed out of Lin Yun’s mouth. “It’s the full moon now, so you can take this to hold a ritual against the ancestors.”

Looking at the seed, the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf instantly figured out that this Saint Sovereign was the one who stole the fruit. But it could only express its gratitude and obediently picked up the seed, “Thank you, Saint Sovereign.”

“Go on. If you can take another step, I don’t mind taking you in and teaching you the path to a Saint!” Ye Guhan said.

The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf’s body trembled when he heard that and immediately kowtowed. “Thank you! Thank you!”

The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf no longer had any grievances and kowtowed before leaving.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he discovered that he was in Ye Guhan’s embrace, and his face was cold without saying a word. Even if he knew that his senior brother was helping him, he still couldn’t help becoming angry because he suffered terribly in this ordeal. He was happily eating a saint fruit in one moment, then was thrown to fight a Quasi-Saint in the next.

“Come. Junior Brother, eat this fruit.” Ye Guhan smiled and shoved a fruit into Lin Yun’s mouth.

Lin Yun subconsciously bit on it and felt a sweetness from the fruit.

“How is it?” Ye Guhan took the fruit back and bit on it. He smiled before Lin Yun could say anything, “Isn’t it sweet like me?”

Lin Yun immediately felt a chill and was so terrified that he jumped out of Ye Guhan’s embrace.

“Hahaha!” Ye Guhan laughed upon seeing this scene.

Lin Yun could feel his goosebumps rising, and he awkwardly smiled, “S-Senior Brother, you’re not straight?”

“Hahaha!” Ye Guhan laughed. He didn’t directly reply and wore a mysterious smile, “You belittle your senior brother. Let’s go and take a look at that wolfie’s ritual. We have to make use of everything we can.”

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun was baffled.

“The Blood Rune Fruit that you ate had to be used in the ritual to bring out the full effects,” Ye Guhan said.

“What?”

“Perhaps it can help you reach the Nirvana Stage!”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up upon hearing that. After all, his foundation was too deep, and this meant he had to accumulate more profound death aura than others. This also meant it would be harder for him to reach the Nirvana Stage since he could clash with enemies at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage when he was at the Profound Death Stage.

“Senior Brother, you won’t con me again, right?” Lin Yun asked cautiously.

But Ye Guhan warmly replied, “Since when have I conned you? I’m only filled with love for you. Look at you right now, hasn’t your Azure Dragon Sword Heart reached the initial phase?”
