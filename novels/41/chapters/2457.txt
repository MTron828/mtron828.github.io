Chapter 2458 - Phoenix and Youth

As for the Black and White Emperors, one brought Lin Yun to find a place to refine the Heavenly Dragon Bone, while Lil’ Purple brought away the other to refine and merge the seven sovereign divine runes.

After leaving the Scarlet Firmament Peak, the Black Emperor soared to the sky with Lin Yun. They came beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven and found a secret realm.

“The Heavenly Path is the thirty-six layers of heaven, right?” Lin Yun asked. With his current strength, he could now explore the thirty-six layers of heaven.

“That’s right. The thirty-six layers of heaven are a barrier protecting the Kunlun Realm. If the Heavenly Path is reforged, the thirty-six layers of heaven will merge with Kunlun Realm,” the Black Emperor said, nodding his head. “At its prime, the Kunlun Realm was a few thousand times larger. The spiritual energy would also be restored when the Heavenly Path was restored. Many ancient forbidden grounds and inheritances would appear at that time, along with ruins. This is why when the Heavenly Path is reforged, everyone in Kunlun Realm has to reach the Deity Realm swiftly, or those would only benefit others.”

“What’s with the eight ancient imperial clans?” Lin Yun asked.

“The eight ancient imperial clans are descendants of Ancestral Deity Realm experts of Kunlun Realm in the past. They reside in the seventy-two mountains beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven, and they’re a layer of protection of Kunlun Realm,” the Black Emperor explained. “They have a deep and unfathomable foundation, but their seclusion environment makes it impossible for them to produce top-tiered geniuses.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thought, and it looks like the Nine Emperors interacted with the eight ancient imperial clans. He asked, “I heard that my master was a member of the Jian Clan?”

“Yeah. He was expelled from the clan, and I reckon they probably regret it now,” the Black Emperor smiled. He took out a massive cauldron, which caused the ground to shake when he placed it down. The cauldron was covered with countless runes and the dragon clan’s treasure, the Myriad Dragon Cauldron. The Black Emperor said, “Come up.”

Lin Yun could only follow the Black Emperor on the cauldron.

“This is the Myriad Dragon Cauldron, and you will refine the Heavenly Dragon Bone inside later. You can’t refine the Heavenly Dragon Bone with your current cultivation, so we must use some external help.” As the Black Emperor spoke, he took out a jade bottle and poured the divine dragon saint liquid into the cauldron.

When the divine dragon saint liquid poured down, it produced a rumbling sound. Seeing the seven-colored liquid, Lin Yun was shocked and took a deep breath. He exclaimed, “Seven-Colored Divine Dragon Saint Liquid!”

He had refined divine dragon saint liquid before, but when he saw seven-colored divine dragon saint liquid, it was refined with seven different divine dragon saint liquids. Just one type of divine dragon saint liquid was precious enough, and he couldn’t imagine the value of the seven-colored divine dragon saint liquid.

Most importantly, the amount was shocking.

The Black Emperor said, “Haven’t you left Kunlun Realm? Why do you still look like a country bumpkin?”

Lin Yun could bet that even if a thousand Emperors beyond the Kunlun Realm added together, they couldn't take out wealth comparable to the seven-colored divine dragon saint liquid. He said, “This is a little too exaggerating.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“The Southern Emperor prepared this. He was invincible back then, destroying countless holy lands. Even most of Blood Moon Sect’s resources were obtained by him,” the Black Emperor sighed.

That made sense now because half of the Southern Emperor would listen to him if the Southern Emperor said a word in his prime.

Lin Yun asked, “Compared to the Southern Emperor, how do the current Yu Qingfeng and the Empress compare to him?”

The Black Emperor merely smiled upon hearing that.

“Stop smiling. I’m genuinely curious about it,” Lin Yun asked.

“Let’s put it this way. The Blood Moon Sect’s sect master was in the Deity Realm. He might’ve reached the Deity Realm through special means, but he’s still a Deity Realm expert, unlike Yan Chen, who was only a Quasi-Deity. Even so, he was defeated by the Southern Emperor, but the Southern Emperor just couldn’t kill him. This was why he used the God Burial Mountain Range’s seal to seal him beneath the mountain range,” the Black Emperor smiled.

“What a pity,” Lin Yun sighed.

“Yeah. What a pity...”The Black Emperor’s hand paused, and he wore a painful expression. He said, “It was already too late when he realized it was impossible to revive someone. If he were around, Yu Qingfeng and the Empress would listen to him. He was the most talented one among the nine of us, and he could also become a mythical emperor even without the Iris Sword Saint’s inheritance.”

Mentioning the Southern Emperor, the Black Emperor wore a pained expression. Half of the cauldron was filled when all the seven-colored divine dragon saint liquid was poured into the cauldron. But that wasn’t all, as the Black Emperor took out a jar with both hands, looking cautious.

“What is that?” Lin Yun asked.

“This is the soul of a pure-blooded Heavenly Dragon. This is also crucial in refining the Heavenly Dragon Bone,” the Black Emperor said. “Your current physique still can’t withstand the Heavenly Dragon Bone, and your body will blow apart if you refine it. The seven-colored divine dragon saint liquid is to help you repair your body. The soul is to ensure that your physique can be comparable to a genuine Heavenly Dragon after refining the Heavenly Dragon Bone, achieving the perfect Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique. The damage to your body is the same as a cocoon breaking into a butterfly. You must repeat this process multiple times and can’t afford to be careless.”

“How many times will it repeat?” Lin Yun asked, taking a deep breath.

Glancing at Lin Yun, the Black Emperor said, “Perhaps a thousand times or even ten thousand times. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have prepared this many seven-colored divine dragon saint liquids. This ensures that your body will be instantly repaired after being destroyed. But, fortunately, you possessed the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique now, or you might not be able to refine the Heavenly Dragon Bone.”

Lin Yun was stumped upon hearing it.

The Black Emperor smiled, “You’re not afraid, right?”

“Of course not,” Lin Yun replied.

A hint of praise flashed in the Black Emperor’s eyes. He said, “Well if I’m in your position, I might not have the courage to do it even if I know that this will greatly enhance my strength. Only a young person like you can have the courage to do it, and this courage is extremely precious.”

This was the first time Lin Yun heard of it, and he smiled, “Judging from what you say, the heart of a youth is more precious than the Myriad Dragon Cauldron and Heavenly Dragon Bone?”

“A human’s life can be long, but the time we spend as a youth is swift. It might not be the most dazzling part of our life, but it’s the most cherished,” the Black Emperor said.

Lin Yun couldn’t understand what the Black Emperor said entirely.

“Go down. I will inject the Heavenly Dragon’s soul into the Myriad Dragon Cauldron and merge it into your body when you’re refining the Heavenly Dragon Bone.” The Black Emperor removed the seal on the Heavenly Dragon Bone and pushed Lin Yun into the cauldron.

When Lin Yun sank into the divine dragon saint liquids, the Heavenly Dragon Bone burrowed into his body, slowly causing damage to his Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique. This process was painful, and Lin Yun’s body was repaired before he could sense the pain. This process kept repeating, and the pain made Lin Yun’s soul tremble.

In the end, Lin Yun sank to the bottom of the divine dragon saint liquid, trying to refine the Heavenly Dragon Bone.

Outside the Myriad Dragon Cauldron, the Black Emperor removed the three seals on the jar. When the Heavenly Dragon’s soul flew out, it was restricted by him and threw it into the Myriad Dragon Cauldron. The dragon runes on the cauldron came to life as countless dragons flew out, coiling around the cauldron.

Time passed in the blink of an eye, and eight days passed.

Lil’ Purple also injected the Nirvana, Samsara, and Chilling Freeze Divine Runes into the sword box. With seven sovereign divine runes, the space in the secret realm expanded by a few hundred times. All the functions were activated, with the spiritual energy becoming ample. The Phoenix Tree also grew to a thousand feet, releasing a sacred radiance.

“This is like a celestial realm.” The White Emperor was stumped when he saw this scene. This secret realm wasn’t as big as the Black-White Sacred Palace, but the quality was much higher. Just the lightning pool itself was a treasure to temper the physique. Observing the Iris Secret Realm, the White Emperor was envious, looking at the various grounds.

There was also a field. If planted with seeds of saint elixirs, the growth would be swift. At that time, Lin Yun could obtain whatever saint elixirs he wanted.

Not to mention the Sun-Moon Divine Rune that mimicked the actual cycle of the sun and moon. Most importantly, the entire Iris Secret Realm belonged to Lin Yun himself.

“The Iris Sword Saint is biased,” the White Emperor sighed.

Lil’ Purple jumped down the Phoenix Tree and said, “What do you know? In his previous life, Lin Yun was a friend of the Blue Dragon Ancestral Lord, while the Iris Sword Saint was the Blue Dragon Ancestral Lord’s disciple. He can be considered the Iris Sword Saint’s disciple and the Blue Dragon Ancestral Lord’s grand disciple.”

“The previous life counts? If you calculate it that way, I can also be considered his grand disciple,” the White Emperor said aggrievedly.

“You should show respect and address me as Lord Phoenix,” Lil’ Purple said.

The White Emperor smiled. He roughly knew Lil’ Purple’s origin and knew that Lil’ Purple wasn’t taking advantage of him even if he addressed her as Lord Phoenix. He smiled, “Lord Phoenix, what instructions do you have for me now?”

Lil’ Purple held onto her chin, and she said, “Let’s go look at that scumbag. He must be suffering now. Now that the Iris Sword Box is completed, it can be considered a comfort to him.”

“Sure,” the White Emperor smiled. When he looked at Lil’ Purple, he knew that she was the greatest treasure compared to the Iris Sword Box. If he could have a Phoenix to follow him, he would have no regret, even if he died. Suddenly, his identity as one of the nine emperors suddenly became dull.
