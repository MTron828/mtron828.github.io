Chapter 1984 - Where Are You Guys Looking At?

The exchange between holy lands was rather serious, and there had never been such a hilarious scene, ten-odd men dancing together to Ye Qingtian’s song, and this scene made everyone from the Heavenly Dao Sect burst into laughter.

Nie Wushuang was incredibly hilarious because he was smiling but trying to control himself with great difficulty. So this made his facial expression become twisted, looking like a clown.

Everyone from the Heavenly Dao Sect laughed heartily, especially when they recalled how cocky Nie Wushaung was. So what if he was Young Master Wushuang? He was nothing but a joke in front of Ye Qingtian, and this scene was enough to make the Divine Dao Pavilion unable to raise their heads for at least half a year.

Ultimately, their Heavenly Dao Sect was still the strongest in the Eastern Desolation.

“We can’t rely on people like Ye Qinghong, Bai Yizhou, and Zhang Kui. Ultimately, we have to depend on Senior Brother Ye to win,” someone sighed, saying what was in everyone’s hearts.

This naturally made the faces of Ye Qinghong, Bai Yizhou, and Zhang Kui dark.

When Lin Yun was done playing Horse Racing, the Divine Dao Pavilion’s disciples were still dancing under the momentum. But when they came to their senses, their faces became red with shame, and could only lower their heads. They wanted to find a hole and hide in it.

Nie Wushuang’s cheeks twitched, and he turned to look at Bai Shuying. He was worried about his image in Bai Shuying’s heart. But when he looked at Bai Shuying, he nearly lost it because Bai Shuying’s gaze was on Ye Qingtian.

“Let’s consider that you won in music. But Ye Qingtian, do you dare to compete in the sword?” Nie Wushuang had no way to vent the emotions in his heart, and his face distorted as he looked at Ye Qingtian. He no longer looked like the gentleman from before, he had lost his elegance.

“What?” Lin Yun stowed the erhu, intending to stop it here. But he couldn’t help looking at Nie Wushuang weirdly after hearing what the latter said.

“What’s the matter? You’re scared?” Nie Wushuang asked indifferently. “Are you not the newly risen genius swordsman within the Heavenly Dao Sect?”

Everyone knew that Nie Wushuang still wasn’t willing to give up. Since he was defeated in his strongest trait, he naturally wanted to defeat Ye Qingtian in Ye Qingtian’s strongest trait as well. A powerful sword intent suddenly exploded out from Nie Wushuang. It was the Firmament Sword Intent at greater mastery. He said, “I know a bit or two about sword techniques. Ye Qingtian, do you dare to spar with me?”

There was a powerful gale in his sword intent. Nie Wushuang’s Wind Intent had reached the sixth grade. This instantly made the faces of everyone from the Heavenly Dao Sect change because Nie Wushuang wasn’t a pushover, and his martial intent alone was enough to intimidate many people.

“I advise you to give up on that,” Lin Yun said. Honestly speaking, he had no interest in bullying someone.

“What’s wrong? You’re afraid?” Nie Wushuang squinted his pupils with a cold light flashing across them.

“You can still compete with me in terms of music. But in the sword… you’re not even worthy of kissing my foot,” Lin Yun said, raising his sword to the Quasi-Astral Sword Intent before flicking his finger.

When a sword ray flew out from his finger, the Quasi-Astral Sword Intent shredded Nie Wushuang’s Galesword Intent. This made Nie Wushuang take several steps back, throwing out a mouthful of blood as he clutched his chest.

“What else do you want to compete in?” Lin Yun looked at Nie Wushaung, keeping a smile on his face. He asked, “Movement technique? Fist technique? Saint physique? Or… background?”

Nie Wushuang’s face alternated between blue and red. For some reason, he was intimidated by Ye Qingtian’s gaze, and this was something he had never felt before. Ye Qingtian seemed like someone he had to look up to.

“Go back, don’t embarrass yourself any longer,” Lin Yun said. “You’re only born in a better environment than most people. But when the Golden Era arrives, one’s background is worthless. If you still behave this way, you’ll soon be surpassed by countless people in your clan, let alone gaining a foothold in the Eastern Desolation.”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Lin Yun’s words were like a dagger stabbing into his heart. Every musical clan flourished, and they had countless branches. He might be a descendant of the main branch, but he would be disposed of if what Lin Yun said really took place.

Nie Wushuang was speechless as he looked at Ye Qingtian. He took a deep breath before he said, “Thanks for your guidance.”

This time, he left without turning around. The other Divine Dao Pavilion’s disciples also had no face to stay here any longer. They covered their faces and quickly left with Nie Wushuang. This was supposed to be a lengthy exchange, but it ended quickly, something no one had expected.

At the beginning of the exchange, Nie Wushuang wanted to use this opportunity to gain a foothold in the Eastern Desolation. But Ye Qingtian’s appearance ruined it all.

“Hmph!” Bai Yizhou, Ye Qinghong, Zhang Kui, and Xiao Jingyan turned to leave, but they coldly looked at Ye Qingtian one last time before leaving. They naturally felt terrible about Ye Qingtian stealing all the limelight, especially Ye Qinghong, who had a deep feud with Ye Qingtian.

“Senior Brother Ye, please hold it right there.” Lin Yun suddenly called out to Ye Qinghong.

The four turned around and curiously looked at Ye Qingtian, not knowing what the latter wanted to do. Ye Qinghong sneered, “Junior Brother Ye was mighty today and slapped Young Master Wushuang in the face. What’s the matter? You want to slap our faces as well?”

He didn’t fear Ye Qingtian, and there was even a hint of provocation in his tone, hoping for Ye Qingtian to make a move. Ye Qinghong was at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and he cultivated the Dao Yang Sword Sutra. He was confident that he could crush Ye Qingtian like an ant.

Lin Yun went straight into the topic and said, “You gave me a palm a month ago, so I wish to return it to you.”

Everyone in the surroundings took a deep breath. From Ye Qingtian’s flick earlier, they already sensed that his cultivation was at the third transformation of the Nirvana Stage. Reaching it in such a short time must definitely be related to a saint origin. But even so, it was tantamount to fantasy to fight Ye Qinghong, who was at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

Ye Qinghong’s face sank, and he said, “It looks like you really want to slap my face. You might have a slight chance of winning with the sword, but do you want to compete without weapons? Haha. Come on, then. Don’t blame me for using too much power to destroy you.”

Ye Qinghong sneered. He wasn’t furious but was looking forward to it, instead.

“Is it that funny?” Ye Qingtian’s figure blurred in front of Ye Qinghong, and his voice suddenly resounded beside Ye Qinghong’s ears.

This startled Ye Qinghong, and he quickly circulated the Dao Yang Sword Sutra. His body became heated, and there was a sword vibration echoing out.

He was like a sharp sword erected in the sun. Lin Yun was already impressed that he could so react quickly, but he was still a tad slower. Before Ye Qinghong could unleash his full strength, he already had to face the incoming attack from Ye Qingtian. But he wasn’t too bothered about it because Ye Qingtian was only at the third transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and he was confident of defeating Ye Qingtian with half of his strength.

When their palms collided, blood splashed as Ye Qinghong screamed. This was because Ye Qinghong’s arm was blown apart, with blood gushing from his shoulder.

“I’ll kill you!” Ye Qinghong lost his rationale and attacked with his other hand.

Lin Yun had already expected this and faced it head-on. When his palm landed on Ye Qinghong’s chest, he circulated sixty thousand strands of nirvana aura, and his terrifying nirvana aura began to fill his body. The aura he gave off was comparable to Ye Qinghong’s seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage aura.

Ye Qinghong disappeared. When he reappeared, he was lying on the ground a thousand meters away and had already fainted.

“Ye Qinghong!” Xiao Jingyan, Bai Yizhou, and Zhang Kui were shocked because everything happened too quickly. When they came to their senses, they naturally became furious because Ye Qingtian was too bold.

“Ye Qingtian, how dare you!” The faces of Xiao Jingyan, Bai Yizhou, and Zhang Kui sank as they charged at Ye Qingtian. They were fast and didn’t have the slightest intention of underestimating Ye Qingtian.

The three knew they would lose their status within the Heavenly Dao Sect if they couldn’t suppress Ye Qingtian. But Lin Yun didn’t dodge the incoming attacks because they would seal off his path of retreat if he dodged.

Golden wings suddenly appeared behind Lin Yun and wrapped around him, blocking the three’s attacks. When the three palms fell on the wings, it felt as though their palms struck a cauldron and caused a muffled collision.

“Golden Crow Wings!” Xiao Jingyan, Bai Yizhou, and Zhang Kui were shocked. It wasn’t a secret that Ye Qingtian had exchanged the Divine Sunchasing Art in the Contribution Hall, but no one expected Ye Qingtian to reach such a terrifying height so quickly. His Golden Crow Wings had nearly reached the level of a Glory Saint Artifact.

At the same time, Lin Yun circulated his two sword sutras and opened his wings, sending the trio flying away. When the trio regained their footing, Lin Yun hovered in the air and was enveloped in a golden radiance that made him look like a deity.

The faces of Xiao Jingyan, Bai Yizhou, and Zhang Kui sank as they circulated their cultivation techniques with various phenomena appearing around them. All of this took place in a brief moment after Nie Wushuang left, and Lin Yun was facing the trio without taking a step back. He was trying to face the three of them before everyone’s eyes.

“That fellow…” Chen Zhong felt his throat dry with the corner of his lips twitching. He began to wonder what kind of monster Ye Qingtian was. Wasn’t it rumored that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint crippled him?

So why did he become stronger, instead? Was this the same person he knew in the Celestial Purging Peak?

Is it only because of the saint origin? Not only him, but everyone else had the same question.

“Are you guys done messing around? Or do you guys want to fight here?” Bai Shuying roared.

Xiao Jingyan, Bai Yizhou, and Zhang Kui quickly stopped and looked at Ye Qingtian with gloating expressions. They naturally thought that Bai Shuying was reprimanding Ye Qingtian. After all, Ye Qingtian had just crippled Ye Qinghong, not to mention he was guilty of intruding on the forbidden ground.

But just when they were waiting to see how Bai Shuying would convict Ye Qingtian, a palm knocked the three down from the air. The power of this palm was terrifying, and it wasn’t what the trio could resist. Their nirvana auras were smashed apart, and they threw out mouthfuls of blood as they looked at Bai Shuying in bafflement.

“I’m asking you guys, so where are you guys looking at?” Bai Shuying asked coldly.

“What?” The trio widened their mouths in disbelief because they couldn’t comprehend what happened. Wasn’t Bai Shuying going to convict Ye Qingtian? So why was she targeting them, instead?”

“Get lost!” Bai Shuying said coldly, seeing that the trio still wanted to say something.

Bai Yizhou’s face changed. He felt embarrassed with resentment to be reprimanded by Bai Shuying, but they didn’t dare to stay and left quickly.

“You, come with me!” Bai Shuying looked at Ye Qingtian before she left.
