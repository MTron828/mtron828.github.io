Chapter 987 - Three Killed With One Sword!

Boundless sword intent spread out of the gate as stars were manifested. The stars occupied half the plaza before they turned into an azure dragon that charged towards Lin Yun.

When the azure dragon landed on Lin Yun, the aura from his Divine Sun Breaking Seal came back to life. Relying on the boundless sword aura, Lin Yun felt like he was the sky itself. When Lin Yun raised his head, the incoming lightning dragon was instantly extinguished.

“Sky sword intent… it’s the real sky sword intent!”

“How the hell did he manage to do that?!” Luo Chen and the others were greatly shocked by this development. They never would have thought that Lin Yun’s strongest trump card was his sky sword intent.

“He’s this terrifying?” The spectators couldn’t believe their eyes. Furthermore, the power of the sky sword intent had far exceeded their expectations.

In the past, Lin Yun would have exhausted most of his origin energy by breaking two monarch fortune martial techniques apart. So right now, his aura was probably at rock bottom and he would be killed by Mu Xiuhan’s attack. But the moment he brought out his sky sword intent, it had left everyone flabbergasted.

Then again, it wasn’t surprising that everyone was so shocked. After all, even in Kunlun Realm, sky sword intent could only be grasped by empyreans. So for Lin Yun to grasp the sky sword intent before reaching the Empyrean Realm was monstrous.

“Break!” Mu Xiuhan’s attack was easily destroyed from a wave of Lin Yun’s hand.

“Sky sword intent…” Mu Xiuhan’s group of three were frozen still. In the next second, their pupils were filled with shock as the boundless sword intent made their blood tingle in fear. They could sense the terrifying aura coming from Lin Yun, which gave them the feeling that Lin Yun was an invincible opponent. With their confidence shattered, there was no way they could win.

“Damn it! H-how is this possible?!” Yu Haotian, who was on the tail stage, exclaimed with a dark expression. Lin Yun’s sky sword intent was a resounding slap to his face and made his heart sink. He thought he could crush Lin Yun with the Divine Glorymoon Fist and the artifact he risked his life for, but it turns out Lin Yun one upped him.

“Damn it!” Mu Xiuhan, Chen Hao, and Zhao Qi looked at Lin Yun as their hands trembled. They could clearly sense how strong Lin Yun was, and they finally knew why Lin Yun dared to face them. So it turns out that Lin Yun had a terrifying trump card.

“Ice beauty, no wonder you took an interest in him. Did you already know about this?” questioned Luo Chen with shock in his voice.

Pei Xue squeezed out a bitter smile and said, “If I knew that he grasped the sky sword intent, I wouldn't have dared to provoke him so casually…”

In the beginning, she had some enmity with Lin Yun. After all, she wanted to capture Lin Yun and force out information about his relationship with Yue Weiwei. Fortunately, she didn’t have an irreconcilable feud with Yue Weiwei and had some appreciation for Lin Yun. So she started to observe Lin Yun by the side and even helped him several times. In the end, she could only say that she was lucky she didn’t have a grudge with Lin Yun or else she would be in deep trouble.

“The three of them just kicked an iron plate.” Luo Chen looked at Mu Xiuhan’s party with ridicule on his face.

Mu Xiuhan’s group of three wanted to retreat because they didn’t want to compete with Lin Yun anymore. They knew how strong the sky sword intent was. Even if they won the fight, they would be reduced to a terrible state.

“None of you can leave here today!” Lin Yun barked while looking at Mu Xiuhan, Zhao Hao, and Zhao Qi.

“Lin Yun, don’t push it. Do you think we’re really afraid of you? So what if you grasped the sky sword intent? You’re still alone by yourself!” Chen Hao said coldly.

“I’ve already given you guys an opportunity and said that this stage has already been taken three times!” Lin Yun’s clothes and hair fluttered in the wind as he yelled. Light even shined from his eyes that made him look like an ancient sword immortal.

Lin Yun was confident he could face them one by one without the use of his sky sword intent. However, he would be slowly exhausted to the point of death if they joined hands. At least, that was the case without his sky sword intent. With his newfound power that flipped the tables, anything was possible. After all, even Lin Yun was fearful of the power of his sky sword intent.

Seeing that Lin Yun had no intention of letting them go, Mu Xiuhan’s eyes flashed coldly, “You really think you can do whatever you want with your sky sword intent? Today, we’ll show you how strong we are!”

When he finished, Mu Xiuhan charged first with bolts of lightning flickering on him. Close behind were Chen Hao and Zhao Qi.

“Good!” Lin Yun charged towards Mu Xiuhan head-on and threw his punch out. As his fist shined brightly, a winged human appeared behind him with golden brilliance. At the same time, a small seal appeared behind the winged human’s head.

Lin Yun’s punch was like a sword streaking across the horizon or a rising sun from the ocean. It instantly sent Mu Xiuhan to the ground as he was in a disadvantageous position. But fortunately, Chen Hao and Zhao Qi came on time to share the burden with Mu Xiuhan. Gritting his teeth, Mu Xiuhan circulated his origin energy as a lightning emperor appeared behind him.

Facing Mu Xiuhan’s punch, Lin Yun didn’t panic, “Eastern Purple Aura!”

Boundless purple aura descended, which made the rising sun look full of vitality. At this moment, the entire sky lit up as if it had broken the shackle that it was bound to. When Lin Yun threw his punch out, another golden seal appeared behind the winged human.

“Rising Flames!” Lin Yun continued his bombardment as he threw another punch out. With the newly risen sun, a dazzling brilliance was cast on the earth. At this moment, Mu Xiuhan could no longer resist as he and his group were sent flying.

Simultaneously, the third seal appeared behind the winged human. When the third seal appeared, a terrifying aura swept out from the winged human with divine brilliance shining from its pupils.

Taking a deep breath, the three seals slowly combined with the Divine Sun Breaking Seal and were prepared to unleash the Divine Sunbreaking Seal’s secret technique. It was a lot easier this time around since he was combining it with his sky sword intent. Then, the three seals began to revolve rapidly, causing the winged human to grow by another thousand meters.

When the brilliance radiated through the entire sky, Mu Xiuhan, Chen Hao, and Zhao Qi could feel that they were being restricted in the space that surrounded them.

“Damn it, how is this possible?!” The three of them exclaimed because they couldn’t move no matter how they struggled.

“Glorysun—Divine Sun Annihilation!” The winged human behind Lin Yun unfolded its wings as every single feather shined with golden brilliance. At this moment, it became the only light source in the world, leaving the other places enveloped in darkness. Light and darkness coexisted in a bizarre balance before an annihilating power exploded out.

Lin Yun used one last punch to restrict Mu Xiuhan, Chen Hao, and Zhao Qi. With an earth-shattering explosion, their origin energies crumbled while fine cracks spread out on their defensive dao artifacts.

Mu Xiuhan, Chen Hao, and Zhao Qi threw up a mouthful of blood as they were covered in wounds and went flying. All of them had disheveled hair as pale faces.

“Quick, leave!” Mu Xiuhan, Chen Hao, and Zhao Qi ran for their lives without any courage to turn around. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“I told you, no one gets to leave!” Lin Yun waved his hand and grabbed his sword. He had exhausted half of his origin energy, but that only destroyed the origin energy barrier around Mu Xiuhan, Chen Hao, and Zhao Qi.

So he didn’t hesitate to draw his sword because he wanted to end this quickly. With his sky sword intent empowering his sword, a dazzling sword ray shined out at an unbelievable speed. When Lin Yun sheathed his sword again, Mu Xiuhan, Chen Hao, and Zhao Qi were turned into a mist of blood.

When the spectators saw the bloody mist, they were quiet. Although they had already guessed that Lin Yun would win when he brought out his sky sword intent, they didn’t trust their eyes. Mu Xiuhan, Chen Hao, and Zhao Qi stood at the pinnacle of the Azure Dragon Region and even had their names on the Heavenly Path Mirror. So how could they be expected to believe Lin Yun could kill all of them?
