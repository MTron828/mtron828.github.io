Chapter 2056 - I Said, Don't Move

Lin Yun’s words placed Yun Feng in an awkward position, and he didn’t know how to reply. After a long silence, Yun Feng smiled, “So… did you say those words?”

Lin Yun pondered and tried to recall what he said to Zhao Wuji that day. He seemed to have said that and didn’t. It wasn’t easy to reply, and Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling. It didn’t matter because those who didn’t like you wouldn’t like you no matter what you say. In the words of swordsmen, people speak with their swords. He replied, “It doesn’t matter. You can treat it as I’ve said that.”

Yun Feng was shocked when he heard what Ye Qingtian said, and he felt that the rumors were probably true. With that, the two fell into a brief silence before the young manor master, Feng Shaoyu, appeared.

After Feng Shaoyu announced the rules, the Sword Alliance began like that. It was as Lin Yun thought; the world of swordsmen was easy because there weren’t many rules in the Sword Alliance. You could challenge anyone; no one would cower under so many eyes. This was because if they cowered, they would be looked down upon by everyone for the rest of their lives.

Either that, or they would stop after several victories to maintain an undefeated streak. Some sects who have conflicts between them would challenge each other here.

Lin Yun noticed that the Sword Assembly was also used to resolve conflicts. After all, there must have been conflicts since so many forces were in the Sword Alliance, and letting disciples fight amongst themselves during the Sword Assembly was a good opportunity and low risk to resolve their feuds.

None of those who made it through the three tests were weak. When Lin Yun briefly glanced around, he noticed that these people were comparable to saint disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect, but there was still a difference compared to the top-tiered geniuses. Occasionally, an exciting battle became an eye-opening experience for Lin Yun.

“That’s the Heavenly Sealing Sword Technique?” A disciple of the Snowfrost Saint Palace attracted Lin Yun's attention. This disciple had cultivated the Quasi-Astral Sword Intent and was at the pinnacle ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. This person won several matches and had become the limelight, with many people remembering his name, Nangong He.

The Snowfrost Saint Palace’s key inheritance was sealing everything in ice, not just frost intent. They used frost intent as the foundation, along with a hint of destruction and life intent. They were famous for their sealing techniques.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This was an eye-opening experience because the inheritance of the Snowfrost Saint Palace was different from what he had imagined. He never expected a single attribute could have so many tricks.

“He’s a lot weaker than Gu Zijing. He has only just reached the initial mastery of the Heavenly Sealing Canon, reaching the third stage,” Yun Feng said when he noticed the interest in Ye Qingtian’s eyes.

A few more decently talented swordsmen fought. Zhang Feng of the Myriad Sword Pavilion and Ouyang Heng of the Black Plume Palace obtained nine consecutive victories. This was just the beginning because the aces hadn’t gone on the lake yet. The disciples who fought so far were enough to show the terrifying foundation of the sword dao holy lands.

Suddenly, Ouyang Heng, who had just obtained ten consecutive victories, swept his gaze and coldly said, “Heavenly Dao Sect’s Ye Qingtian, do you dare to fight me?!”

Everyone was stunned, and an uproar exploded because Ye Qingtian had recently become famous for his arrogance, claiming to be the second Jian Jingtian.

“Brother, all the best to you,” Yun Feng said, moving away from Ye Qingtian.

Everyone followed Ouyang Heng’s gaze and looked at Ye Qingtian. Was this the Ye Qingtian who peeked at the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden showering, defeated Zhao Wuji’s sword servants, and even claimed to be the second Jian Jingtian?

At the palace, Feng Shaoyu also directed his gaze over and looked a little nervous. If someone from the Eastern Desolation took away the first rank of this Sword Assembly again, it would be a huge blow to the Sword Alliance.

“This person is the second Jian Jingtian?” Feng Shaoyu frowned. He didn’t want what happened twenty years ago to repeat itself.

“He’s just a cocky person,” Zhao Wuji said. “My junior brother is more than enough to deal with him.”

Zhao Wuji was confident that Ye Qingtian couldn’t defeat Ouyang Heng, and everyone from the Southern Border felt the same.

“Ye Qingtian, aren’t you really cocky? Why don’t you dare come to the lake?” Ouyang Heng sneered. There had never been someone who didn’t dare to go to the lake after being challenged, and many people felt that Ye Qingtian was afraid since he didn’t dare to go to the lake.

“He’s the second Jian Jingtian?”

“Ouyang Heng already obtained ten consecutive victories, so he’s probably afraid.”

“Since when are there swordsmen from the Eastern Desolation? The Eastern Desolation has long declined.” Discussions resounded from the surroundings as many people looked at Ye Qingtian with disdain.

“Ye Qingtian, come up and fight me!” Ouyang Heng roared. His roar was angry, making the sky tremble with ripples spreading on the lake.

Lin Yun felt helpless because he didn’t want to take advantage of Ouyang Heng, who fought several rounds in a row. He wanted to explain but shut his mouth, seeing Ouyang Heng so domineering. Spreading his arms apart, he landed on the lake.

The clear water was hotter than magma despite how it looked. When Lin Yun stepped on the lake, it created no ripples.

“You can rest now, and there’s no need to fight me so soon,” Lin Yun said.

Ouyang Heng’s eyes flashed with mockery, and he sneered, “Are you afraid of my ten consecutive wins? If that’s the case, I don’t mind giving you an opportunity. You can accept my challenge when my aura settles down if you say I’m taking advantage of you.”

“No need. You can make your move now,” Lin Yun said, shaking his head.

“I will defeat you within three moves. Don’t think sword servants are comparable to saint disciples of the Black Plume Palace!” Ouyang Heng was confident as he grinned and ran over. As he ran, the black clothes behind him turned into a pair of wings enveloped in demonic flames.

At the same time, Ouyang He’s Quasi-Astral Sword Intent was also released and spread out across this lake. When he got close to YeQingtian, he drew the saint sword out with boundless sword intent gushing out, manifesting into a giant saint sword.

When the black wings unfolded, they covered the sky with a powerful descending pressure that made everyone uncomfortable. This sword was powerful because Ouyang Heng only used one to defeat his opponents. Under the powerful sword aura, it would be hard for him to make a move, not to mention withstanding the sword head-on. Ouyang Heng clearly wanted to repeat his past victories and defeat Ye Qingtian with one sword.

“Ye Qingtian is in danger.” Yu Feng muttered.

“Ouyang Heng is really strong! It’s this sword again!” Many swordsmen exclaimed with excitement when they saw this scene. Many people already began to clap their hands, waiting to see Ye Qingtian being sent flying away.

Suddenly, Lin Yun used two fingers as his sword and swung them. When a crisp sound echoed, the saint sword that had turned into a sword ray was sent flying away. Ouyang Heng’s sword was sent flying away when clashing with Lin Yun’s fingers.

“See what I mean? You should’ve rested before challenging me. You can’t even hold your sword properly,” Lin Yun said.

Ouyang Heng widened his mouth in surprise. Even those about to clap were dumbfounded; they couldn’t believe that Ouyang Heng’s sword was knocked away, looking at this scene with disbelief.

“You think I only have one sword?” Ouyang Heng’s face sank, and he thrusted another sword at Ye Qingtian’s chest.

But when he thrust it, he was surprised to discover that what he attacked was a few afterimages of where Ye Qingtian stood. The afterimages were swaying, leaving ripples in the surrounding space, and Ouyang Heng couldn’t lock onto Ye Qingtian. As expected, Ouyang Heng’s sword had missed. When Ouyang Heng wanted to draw his sword back, Ye Qingtian moved again and swung his hand out.

The saint sword couldn’t be drawn back in time and was snapped by Ye Qingtian’s fingers, frightening everyone. Ye Qingtian had only knocked the saint sword away earlier, but he snapped the sword now.

When Ouyang Heng drew a sword from his sleeve, Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, fusing the indigo-golden dragon runes and sword intent in his fingers before making a downwards slash movement.

“Damn it!” Ouyang Heng’s eyes sank, and summoned another saint sword again, thrusting it forth.

Lin Yun noticed the swords all had the Hidden Sword Manor logo. The Nether Ethereal City sold a lot of saint swords during this period. It didn’t take Lin Yun long to sever nine saint swords, causing Ouyang Heng’s face to turn green.

“It looks like the quality of Hidden Sword Manor’s swords isn’t that good,” Lin Yun said with his hands behind him.

Ouyang Heng was furious because he was fooled by Ye Qingtian right from the beginning. This made him so furious about using his trump card.

“Don’t move. You’ve already lost.” Lin Yun spun on the spot with the Flower Burial Sword appearing in his right hand. He didn’t draw the sword; the sword scabbard was on Ouyang Heng’s head. This was because Lin Yun had held back; otherwise, he would’ve smashed Ouyang Heng’s head.

This made Ouyang Heng’s face pale with fright. His legs trembled, and he wanted to struggle.

But when Lin Yun gently pressed down with his sword, Ouyang Heng felt like a mountain was crashing down on him, forcing him to his knees.

“I said, don’t move,” Lin Yun said with a cold light flashing in his pupils.

This made Ouyang Heng begin to sweat with a chill running down his spine. It's as if he was facing a fiendgod.
