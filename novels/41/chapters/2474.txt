Chapter 2475 - Heavenly Dao, Aid Me!

Together with Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun returned to the summit of the Heavenly Divine Mountain. Lil’ Purple also transformed back to her human form. When Lin Yun looked at her, she looked a lot better now, looking like she was fourteen to fifteen.

Lin Yun only managed to discover it after looking closer because they were too familiar with each other. Lin Yun exclaimed, “I just realized you’ve grown taller now. In the past, you still wanted me to help you tie your braids.”

“Do I look good?” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“Yeah,” Lin Yun replied. Honestly speaking, Lil’ Purple looked exquisite; anyone could tell she would be beautiful when she grew up. This was the first time Lin Yun felt that breathtaking wasn’t suitable for someone because she was a phoenix, to begin with.

“Flower Burial, think about how long it has been since you tied braids for me,” Lil’ Purple smiled, squinting.

Lin Yun was stumped because that was when he just arrived in Kunlun Realm. Now that he looked at it, it had been eight years. As memories flashed in his mind, he sighed, “Time passes quickly. I now understand what Yu Qingfeng said.”

Yu Qingfeng said he only wanted to be a carefree child, but he became a Sword Emperor before he knew it, becoming a man.

“So if you look at it, I should be fourteen or fifteen now, not to mention that the Phoenix Tree has grown up,” Lil’ Purple said.

“There’s nothing wrong with that, but you must add another hundred thousand years before that,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Scumbag, you’re asking for a beating!” Lil’ Purple was furious and wanted to give Lin Yun a beating, but Lin Yun merely wore a smile and held onto her hand.

Lin Yun said, “In my eyes, you’re still a child regardless of whether you're fourteen or a hundred thousand years old. I hope you will always be a carefree child and leave the troublesome matters to me. I don’t ever want to see you cry.”

“You...” Lil’ Purple’s nose felt sour, and her eyes became watery as she looked at Lin Yun.

“Hmph, you said that I must stand behind you?” Lil’ Purple shook Lin Yun’s hand away and raised her brow. She said, “I’m a phoenix!”

But Lil’ Purple didn’t dare to look at Lin Yun again and turned into a phoenix, soaring to the sky.

This made Lin Yun wear a smile because he cultivated to ensure that those he cared about could fly freely in the sky. With a wave of his hand, Lin Yun took out the invitation given to him by the Flame Emperor and muttered, “13th of month four...I will be there!”

At the summit of the Heavenly Divine Mountain, the Heavenly Dao’s might was comparable to the emperor’s tribulation.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yin kept the invitation and began cultivating. When he relaxed, he released all his sword intent, allowing Heavenly Dao’s might to envelop him.

Now that the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique had utterly fused with the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique, it instantly suppressed the aura. When his aura and blood flowed within his body, it produced a rumbling sound.

Lin Yun said nothing and began executing the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique, releasing the Heavenly Dragon’s aura.

Every punch and palm would cause a resonation with the world. The wind would flow as though the mountains and rivers were breathing as though they possessed a heartbeat. This was the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique that defeated the Golden Emperor Physique, but the aura wasn’t fully unleashed.

Lin Yun was giving it an attempt to cross through time, summoning the Heavenly Dragon from ancient times. It was impossible to cross through time, but the Heavenly Dragon Bone allowed Lin Yun to sense the Heavenly Dragon from ancient times.

As the Heavenly Dragon Bone appeared, ancient scenes appeared in Lin Yun’s mind, including the numerous secrets and the Dragon Clan’s secret techniques. Lin Yun’s eyes became gold, filled with divinity, when he formed seals with his hands.

A thousand years, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years...and a million years. Lin Yun’s soul began to travel back in time. He finally appeared in the starry sky and saw countless pure-blood divine dragons and true dragons bowing to the Heavenly Dragon in the sky. The Heavenly Dragon was the lord of all dragons, who made all the dragons bow with a roar, releasing a powerful aura that even Lin Yun felt suffocating.

When Lin Yun was shocked, the Heavenly Dragon raised his head, traveled through time, and fell onto Lin Yun a million years later. Time fluctuated at the Heavenly Divine Mountain’s summit, and the energy contained in each ripple was comparable to an Emperor’s attack.

“Heavenly Dragon Possession!” Lin Yun came to his senses and received a Heavenly Dragon Secret Seal in his mind. A dragon’s image traveled through time and appeared on the Heavenly Divine Mountain’s summit. When the dragon entered Lin Yun’s body, the entire path began to tremble, and all the swordsmen present were horrified.

Letting out a breath, Lin Yun performed the Sovereign Dragon Fist on the Heavenly Divine Mountain’s summit. Countless figures appeared around Lin Yun, looking like they were separated from time and space. With a raise of his hand, each ripple could unleash a terrifying ripple of space-time.

At this moment, Lin Yun looked like a god. But that wasn’t the most terrifying part because the Heavenly Dragon’s blood began to ignite within Lin Yun’s body. The dragon aura he gave off began to release, and he wanted to throw out a punch. But no matter how he tried, his punch was greatly obstructed.

The time-space energy from a million years ago put his body in danger with the crisis of collapsing. But in the critical moment, the Heavenly Dragon Bone bloomed with boundless vitality, allowing him to recover. In the end, Lin Yun threw a punch out, manifesting into a massive dragon’s claw, looking like a genuine Heavenly Dragon claw that left a hole in space. This was the Heavenly Divine Mountain’s summit, and the time-space here was stronger than in other places in the Kunlun Realm.

“I succeeded!” Lin Yun ignored the exhaustion to his vitality and rejoiced, throwing out his punches with each punch capable of causing the Heavenly Dragon’s claw from ancient times to descend. When Lin Yun exhausted all his vitality, he summoned the Heavenly Dragon’s tail that swept on the Heavenly Divine Mountain.

The Heavenly Divine Mountain began to tremble, wanting to snap the mountain. But heavenly daos might descend with shackles formed with runes protecting the Heavenly Divine Mountain. But when the shackles snapped, the Heavenly Divine Mountain began to shake, instantly causing a terrifying phenomenon.

An aura comparable to the Emperor’s tribulation appeared with a vortex that felt like an eye looking down on Lin Yun. Countless lightning formed into a giant sword in the vortex, similar to the secret technique taught by the Iris Sword Saint.

“Mhm?” Lin Yun was stumped because he never expected this phenomenon. Could the Iris Sword Saint comprehend his secret technique through Heavenly Dao’s tribulation? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Sword box...” Just when Lin Yun was stumped, Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded in his ears. When he came to his senses, he was deeply shocked as he had exhausted all his vitality and was in a weakened state. If this sword descended from the sky, he would lose his life.

Lin Yun soared to the sky, and his sword box fell off. With a somersault, he slammed the sword box into the ground like a sword when he landed on the ground.

The seven sovereign divine runes flew out, releasing a seven-colored radiance that formed into a massive Iris Divine Rune. The rune was like a wall that blocked the sword, but the shockwave alone sent Lin Yun flying away.

When Lin Yun fell from the sky, he had fainted. Lil' Purple caught onto him in the critical moment, and Lin Yun threw out another mouthful of blood, coughing. When he came to his senses, he was lying in Lil’ Purple’s embrace, who looked at him with a gentle gaze.

“You’re awake!” Lil’ Purple smiled. She knew Lin Yun would be fine if he regained consciousness with the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique.

“What place is this...?” Lin Yun asked. Even breathing was painful, and he didn’t dare raise his voice.

“Yu Qingfeng’s shoulder,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun was shocked upon hearing that, but he soon figured that she must be talking about Yu Qingfeng’s statue. Far away, the White Emperors and everyone heaved in relief after seeing Lin Yun regain consciousness.

The White Emperor’s face was covered in dust, and he sighed, “Radiant, your disciple knows how to play.”

“It’s fine. Let’s carry on,” the Radiant Sword Emperor smiled.

The White Emperor wanted to dodge subconsciously. This was because he soon had a trauma after sparring with the Radiant Sword Emperor. He felt that fighting with Yu Qingfeng was better than fighting with the Radiant Sword Emperor because the latter didn’t show mercy when they fought.

On Yu Qingfeng’s statue, Lin Yun rested briefly and recovered.

After he recovered, he smiled, “Let’s go and have some fun.”

“Are you insane?” Lil’ Purple asked in shock.

“I can sense that the Heavenly Dao wasn’t genuinely furious but was helping me to perfect the secret technique,” Lin Yun smiled, holding onto his chin. “Furthermore, the secret technique isn’t invincible. Didn’t you see how to block it with the sovereign divine runes?”

Lil’ Purple squinted, and she muttered, “That makes some sense, but isn’t that too terrifying...”

“It is much weaker than the actual secret technique, and the heavenly dao is probably afraid that it would kill me,” Lin Yun said.

“You know how to gold-plate yourself,” Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes.

“Hahaha! Who knows! We’ll know after giving it a try,” Lin Yun laughed and landed on the Heavenly Divine Mountain’s summit again.
