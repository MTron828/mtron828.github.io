Chapter 616 - You Can’t Catch Up

The hall was silent except for Qin An and Pei Yue’s nervous breathing. Right now, Pei Yue’s eyes were filled with regret. If he could go back in time, he wouldn’t have challenged Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was already about to leave, but he was the one who called out to Lin Yun. At that time, he didn’t put Lin Yun in his eyes because he felt that he could deal with Lin Yun together with Qin An.

His thought wasn’t bad because they had Lin Yun suppressed when Lin Yun wasn’t using his sword. They even managed to inflict more injuries on Lin Yun and victory was within their grasp. But the moment Lin Yun drew his sword, the tables turned instantly and resulted in their complete defeat.

Furthermore, Lin Yun’s sword intent was extremely terrifying. Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent was also in greater mastery, but it was a lot more terrifying than Xie Yunqiao. Even at this moment, Pei Yue couldn’t figure out what happened.

“Lin Yun, let us go. I promise that I won’t give you any trouble even afterwards!” Qin An begged with his voice trembling. If anyone was here, they would be shocked by how cowardly Qin An was behaving. They didn’t want to die here and they still wanted to give the ninth level a try. So even if they were filled with reluctance, they had no other choice but to beg.

“Who will let me off if I let you off?” asked Lin Yun coldly. He knew Pei Yue and Qin An well. If he had fallen in their hands, they would definitely not let him off so easily. Furthermore, who would let him off if he bumped into Ji Wuye or Yan Kong in the ninth level if he let them off? So it was naturally impossible for him to let them off.

“The name of this sword is Frost Moon. I can give it to you if you’re willing to let us off!” Qin An gnashed his teeth as he took out a short sword from his interspatial pouch. Strictly speaking, this short sword was more like a dagger instead of a sword. But it had a high grade and was rare even among ancient cosmic artifacts. There were complicated spiritual runes engraved on it and it looked like it was forged with moonlight.

Qin An had spent some effort to take this sword from Yang Fan, but it was a pity that he ran into Lin Yun. He was defeated before he could even use it. It was undeniable that this sword was precious, so anyone could imagine the pain he was going through in his heart right now.

Lin Yun glanced at Qin An before he took the sword and held it. Looking at the body of the sword that glowed in his hand like the moon, Lin Yun muttered, “Good sword…”

Qin An had joy written on his face when he heard that and his eyes flashed coldly. But just when he was about to speak, blood suddenly flowed out from his mouth. When he lowered his head, he noticed that the Frost Moon was stabbed into his chest.

This made Qin An’s face change drastically as a terrifying chill began to spread throughout his body. “You!”

Although Lin Yun didn’t put any origin energy behind the attack, it was still terrifying as the sword was a cosmic artifact. So this meant that he would have to rely on the heavens to survive this ordeal.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun spoke out, “This is a good sword, but you’re not a good person. I don’t wish to see you on the ninth level.”

When Lin Yun pulled the sword out, blood splashed out from Qin An’s chest. But there wasn’t a single bloodstain on the sword as it maintained its pearly white color.

Meanwhile, Qin An instantly panicked as he held onto his chest and circulated his origin energy to resist the chill invading his body. Even Pei Yue was terrified when he saw this scene as he never imagined that Lin Yun would be so decisive to launch such a serious attack all of a sudden.

Perhaps they had a misunderstanding that Lin Yun wasn’t fond of killing. In reality, Lin Yun had taken countless lives with his sword. If he hadn’t, the Seven Slaughtering Seal wouldn’t be so terrifying after being multiplied seven times. Maybe their misunderstanding was that Lin Yun was a pushover and that he would let them off if they begged.

When Lin Yun turned to look at Pei Yue, Pei Yue was jolted awake with a chilling feeling in his spine. His nightmare had turned into reality in an instant. But without hesitation, Pei Yue’s palm hit his own chest and wounded his internal organs. His injuries were even heavier than Qin An at this moment. Looking at Lin Yun, Qin An said weakly, “Don’t worry, you won’t see me on the ninth level.”

The two were heavily injured and there was no way they could recover anytime soon even if they had a divine pellet. This meant that their journey in the empyrean’s tomb had come to an end.

“Goodluck,” said Lin Yun as he kept the Frost Moon and departed. This time, the two no longer dared to call out to Lin Yun. They only looked at Lin Yun’s back as they trembled in fear.

At the same time, in another hall on the eighth level, there was a pool that radiated with chill as a crimson lotus hovered over its center. When Ji Wuye stepped in and saw the treasure, he muttered to himself, “The Sevenstar Scarletflame Lotus?”

A Scarletflame Lotus was extremely precious, not to mention one that had reached seven stars. Although it wasn’t useful to him right now, it would be different once he reached the Yin-Yang stage. Suddenly, Ji Wuye turned around and looked at Yan Kong who had also entered the hall. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Ji Wuye, you’re not dead?” Yan Kong’s face turned grim when he saw Ji Wuye. Clearly, the two had a long history of enmity and his words were filled with venom.

“Don’t worry. How can I be dead when you’re not? Since we ran into each other, then let me send you on your way. You can watch from outside how I obtain the empyrean’s legacy and the Astral Pearl!” Ji Wuye sneered with disdain.

“Haha, what a joke!” Yan Kong laughed. “Even someone outside the ranking didn’t place you in his eyes. Do you think you are fit to obtain the empyrean’s legacy?”

Yan Kong’s words were like salt that rubbed Ji Wuye’s wound. Ji Wuye’s face was grim as he released his killing aura that caused the surrounding space to freeze. “You’ll know soon enough!”

But since Yan Kong was also called a fiendgod, he naturally didn’t fear Ji Wuye’s killing aura as he unleashed a powerful killing aura at the same level as Ji Wuye. The two fiendgods clashed the moment they met without bothering to negotiate.

Ji Wuye and Yan Kong were both acknowledged as geniuses who could get through the ninth trial, so they fought the moment they met each other. After all, only one of them could obtain the empyrean’s legacy and Astral Pearl. At the same time, they also wished to see who was more powerful after four years had passed.

An hour later, a person appeared in the hall where Qin An and Pei Yue were in. The newcomer had a powerful sword intent that radiated from his body, which caused Qin An and Pei Yue’s faces to change. They thought that Lin Yun had returned. However, when they saw that it was Bai Lixuan, they were relieved.

“Who did this to you guys?” Bai Lixuan asked with surprise in his eyes.

“What does it have to do with you?” Pei Yue and Qin An replied coldly. They naturally didn’t want to reveal that they ganged up on Lin Yun only to be defeated.

Bai Lixuan smiled when he saw Pei Yue and Qin An. The two were as stubborn as Guo Xu. Could it be that they were also defeated by Lin Yun? But the smile soon froze on his face. He knew that he couldn’t accept it if his speculation was true.

It was okay if it was only Guo Xu since he was only ranked seventh-eight on the outer ranking. But Pei Yue and Qin An were infamous and were both in the top ten on the outer ranking. Even his senior brother, Xie Yunqiao, might not be able to defeat them both.

This was why Bai Lixuan quickly dismissed Lin Yun from his mind. After all, only Yan Kong or Ji Wuye could defeat them both since his senior brother didn’t even have the strength to do it.

“It’s not Lin Yun, right?” Bai Lixuan asked with a smile while pretending to be casual. But when he noticed the changes on Qin An and Pei Yue’s faces, Bai Lixuan instantly narrowed his eyes together. He had already found out the answer even without them speaking.

Instantly, Bai Lixuan’s face sank down and his face was even uglier than Qin An and Pei Yue. He bit on his lips as blood began to flow out. After a long time, he asked, “Where is he?”

“Left.”

Bai Lixuan then left quickly to chase after Lin Yun’s footsteps. But the moment he turned around, Qin An glanced at him and said, “You can’t catch up to him.”

Those words instantly set off a bomb in Bai Lixuan’s mind as those words began to echo in his thoughts. He suddenly turned around and glared at Qin An ferociously, which left Qin An at a loss.

After Bai Lixuan left, Qin An grumbled, “What’s wrong with him? Lin Yun already left an hour ago, so how can he possibly catch up to him? What’s with that glare?”

“I heard that he also came from the Great Qin Empire like Lin Yun,” said Pei Yue.

Upon hearing that, Qin An’s eyes flashed as he roughly had an idea of what was going on.
