Chapter 953 - This Is My Confidence!

When Lin Yun voiced out, only then did everyone wake up from their shock. After all, the cat was only Lin Yun’s pet. Since the cat was so strong, this gave everyone a misperception that Lin Yun was even stronger.

Liu Mu wanted to interfere upon seeing that the elites from his realm were being fooled by the cat but he soon recovered from his shock when Lin Yun’s killing intent was directed at him once more. Just a moment ago, he still couldn’t place Lin Yun in his eyes. But just Lin Yun’s pet alone had caused such a huge mess.

With his face dark, Liu Mu stared at Lin Yun, “Mo Yan, keep that bastard busy. I’ll deal with this brat personally. I’m curious where you get your confidence from!”

He knew that if he allowed Lin Yun to be arrogant, then all the prestige of their Bloodbone Realm would be lost. So Lin Yun had to die today no matter what!

“Don’t worry. This bastard might be troublesome, but it won’t be able to cause any trouble. You can deal with that brat!” Mo Yan looked at Lil’ Red coldly while wiping the blood off his lips. Although he was in a pathetic state, he didn’t suffer any injuries.

Perhaps he might not be able to deal with this cat any time soon, but he was confident that he could keep it busy. As long as Lin Yun didn’t have this cat to help him, it should be more than enough for Liu Mu to kill Lin Yun.

At the same time, the atmosphere in the plaza became dense because they knew the fight between Lin Yun and Liu Mu was starting soon.

“You want to fight me? As you wish!” Letting out a roar, Liu Mu unleashed all the demonic aura from his body and charged towards Lin Yun in the blink of an eye. Using his palm as a blade, countless crimson origin energy flowed into his palm before manifesting into a thirty meters crimson blade that could even cut space apart. Furthermore, the corrosive effect coming from the blade was even more terrifying.

Under the corrosion of the demonic aura, everything in the path of Liu Mu’s blade became pitch black. Before the blade even descended, cracks had already started to spread out on the plaza. Not even Lil’ Red’s fight with Mo Yan was so terrifying. So one could see that Liu Mu was a lot stronger than Mo Yan.

“Great timing!” Lin Yun’s eyes surged with killing intent with no intention of retreating. Waving his hand, his iris sword energy and azure firmament sword energy started pouring into his palm before manifesting into an azure dragon. When Lin Yun clenched his fist together, his fist and azure dragon sword aura both merged at the same time which unleashed an earth-shattering dragon roar.

Under everyone’s shocked gazes, Lin Yun soared into the sky and faced Liu Mu’s attack head-on. When the two attacks clashed together, boundless energy started cracking with a violent storm sweeping out. Just the shockwave of their clash alone had sent many people flying out. This made many people’s faces change while they quickly retreated.

Just when the two fought on the plaza, the ground began to tremble violently. Suddenly with a rumbling explosion, Lin Yun and Liu Mu both retreated. Regardless of Lin Yun’s sword aura or Liu Mu’s blade, they both shattered at the same time.

This caused Liu Mu to take ten steps back, leaving a deep footprint on the ground when he retreated. Although Lin Yun also took ten steps back, the dissipated sword aura around him became more condensed whenever he took a step. When he finally stabilized his figure, his boundless azure dragon sword aura had regathered and reached the pinnacle.

Lin Yun and Liu Mu were both evenly matched in their confrontation. This made many people surprised when they looked at Lin Yun. After all, they didn’t use much of their martial technique and Lin Yun didn’t fall into the disadvantageous position. Just this alone was unbelievable. Even the owners of the five astral spirits were surprised.

After all, Liu Mu was in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Although he had just made his breakthrough, his foundation was deep and could stand at the pyramid in the Azure Dragon Region. But even so, he still couldn’t obtain an advantage facing Lin Yun.

“Interesting.” Liu Mu squinted his eyes. He was surprised but he also felt that he had seen through Lin Yun. He sneered, “You’re not simple. No wonder you dare to be so arrogant. Aside from your sword intent, your cultivation must’ve also reached a high stage, right? But it’s a pity that you have no idea of my foundation…”

When he finished, dazzling crimson brilliance shone out from his body as if they were manifested by his blood which left many people shocked. His aura was terrifying, to begin with. But now, his aura had grown to a terrifying height. When the crimson radiance reached a limit, a violent killing intent started pouring out when Liu Mu charged forth.

This made Lin Yun surprised because he realized that he couldn’t underestimate Liu Mu. He knew that it would be hard for him to kill Liu Mu if he didn’t use his sky sword intent. Before he had more time to think, Liu Mu had already reached him.

Pushing his azure dragon sword aura to the limit combined with his two sword sutras, a sword started buzzing and he stomped his foot on the ground before charging towards Liu Mu head-on. This time, their clash was even more ferocious, especially Liu Mu who directed his attacks at Lin Yun’s fatal spots. Relying on the great advantage in his cultivation and the unique massacre intent from Bloodbone Realm, Lin Yun’s azure dragon sword aura was gradually being suppressed.

“Let’s see what other trump cards you have after I destroy your sword intent!” Liu Mu smiled as the crimson radiance around him started wiggling as if it was alive. As it wiggled, it even tried to assimilate and devour Lin Yun’s sword aura.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Lin Yun’s sword aura is really strong. His spiritual sword intent had simply reached perfection and the sword aura coming from him didn’t seem to be something from a pinnacle first soul Heavenly Soul Realm expert. In terms of sword intent, I don’t think there’s anyone stronger than him in Heavenly Path.”

“Isn’t this a piece of crap? If his sword intent isn’t strong, Mo Yan alone can easily deal with him.”

“But he’s still lacking. Liu Mu isn’t an ordinary genius in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, not to mention that the other higher realms’ geniuses are all watching. Lin Yun’s situation isn’t optimistic…”

“He’s indeed a talent.” All the geniuses looked at Lin Yun and shook their heads. Many higher realms' leaders also started wearing a playful expression looking at Lin Yun with greed flashing in their pupils. On the other hand, the five owners of the astral spirits had their eyes flashing with the intention of recruiting Lin Yun.

But even so, no one was optimistic about Lin Yun. After all, Liu Mu’s cultivation was a lot higher. So even if Lin Yun’s sword intent was heaven-defying, there was no way he could turn the tables around with this much.

“Crimson Demonarmored Fist!”

“Azure Dragon Incinerating Palm!” After ten-odd moves later, Lin Yun and Liu Mu executed their fortune martial techniques once more with two shocking phenomena taking form. One side was a black azure dragon tearing apart the sky and the other side was a giant crimson armoured skeleton of three hundred meters.

When the two phenomena clashed together, a dazzling brilliance exploded from their exchange that even caused the altar to tremble lightly with a brilliant dragon roar echoing out. When the soundwave from the dragon roar spread out, many people were taken by surprise and could feel their internal organs tumbling. It was only a split second and the dragon roar had already disappeared.

They saw Lin Yun sent flying a few hundred meters out with blood dripping down from his lips. This instantly caused a huge commotion and the greed in the eyes of the higher realms’ leaders grew even denser. “Lin Yun is injured!”

“Lin Yun, your death is here. Kneel and I’ll give you an easy death.” Liu Mu’s face became sinister while the other Bloodbone Realm’s geniuses had joy reflected on their faces because Lin Yun finally suffered a loss.

“This is only the beginning. We still have no idea who will be the one to kneel and beg for his life,” said Lin Yun while he wiped the blood off his lips. He didn’t know where Liu Mu got his confidence from. After all, it would be surprising if Lin Yun could inflict injuries on Liu Mu without using his sky sword intent.

At the same time, their fight also gave him a clearer understanding of his current strength. Refining divine astral pellets had closed up the difference in their foundation. Even if he couldn’t face them head-on, they also couldn’t suppress him.

He knew that he would undergo another transformation when he reached the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. At the same time, everyone here was shocked by Lin Yun's words. After all, Lin Yun had been clearly suppressed by Liu Mu, but Lin Yun still dared to be so arrogant? They had no idea where he got his confidence from. Did he think that he could face Liu Mu without the help of his pet?

“You’re courting death! Let me see where your confidence comes from!” Liu Mu’s eyes flashed coldly. He didn’t give Lin Yun the time to think and appeared above Lin Yun with the crimson armoured skeleton appearing behind him once more. When the skeleton appeared, the entire sky turned red with a terrifying chill spreading out, accompanied by ghastly howls.

Just the voice alone was enough to make many people in the plaza tremble with fear. But Lin Yun’s eyes merely flickered before he executed the Divine Glorysun Fist with a dazzling golden brilliance shining out from his right hand.

“Divine Sunbreaking Seal!” Along with an earth-shattering roar, Lin Yun was done condensing the Divine Sunbreaking Seal. When he clenched his fist, a winged human appeared behind him in the blink of an eye with the ancient seal looking like a bright sun.

When he threw his punch out, it had completely caught Liu Mu by surprise and disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already in mid-air, Liu Mu sent flying out from the impact and threw out a mouthful of blood.

“Where did my confidence come from? This is my confidence!” Lin Yun took a step out and the winged human behind him unfolded with a golden brilliance enveloping the entire plaza. When Lin Yun threw his punch out, Liu Mu’s chest sunk in and disappeared before everyone’s view. By the time he reappeared, he had already collided with the sacred altar.

When the altar shook violently, a dragon roar echoed out once more. But when the shockwave spread out and was about to reach Lin Yun, a dragon roar also echoed out from within his body with his hair fluttering in the wind. Facing the dragon roar, a roar also echoed out from within Lin Yun’s body which shattered the dragon roar from the altar and left everyone dumbfounded.
