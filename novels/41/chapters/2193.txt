Chapter 2194: Gentleman’s Sword, the Nether Orchid Courtyard (1)

“Holy Maiden, is the Nether Orchid Courtyard that important?” Outside the main hall, Bai Xiao looked at Bai Shuying with confusion. Since Bai Xiao didn’t know the inside story, his thoughts were more or less the same as the elders in the main hall.

In his view, the reason why the Ye Clan created such a big fuss was to drive the Bai Clan out of the Heavenly Dao Sect before seizing the Bai Clan’s interests and position within the Heavenly Dao Sect once the chaos comes to an end. This was a huge gamble, and the Ye Clan would reap huge benefits if they won. If the Bai Clan lost their foothold within the Heavenly Dao Sect, it would be meaningless, even if they could protect the Celestial Pool.

Right then, a loud noise echoed in everyone’s ears. The array enveloping the courtyard was activated, which formed into a semicircle energy dome with many ancient runes engraved on it. Looking from afar, the runes looked like a complicated and massive Nether Orchid Flower.

Nether Orchid Flowers could be found everywhere in the Nether Orchid Courtyard, and they were emitting a faint radiance at this moment with sword auras gathered on the barrier. This was the array that protected the entire Nether Orchid Courtyard, the Nether Orchid Sword Array.

This array could attack and defend, possessing great power. But no one from the Nether Orchid Courtyard was focused on defending. This was because outside the barrier, the Ye Clan’s Saints held various saint artifacts or secret treasures, attacking at the energy dome.

As for Bai Shuying and Bai Xiao, they were shocked when they sensed the terrifying energy fluctuations. There were many people shuttling around the entire Nether Orchid Courtyard, protecting the nodes of the Nether Orchid Sword Array under the command of Saints.

Bai Shuying briefly glanced at it, then said, “It shouldn’t be that important in the eyes of the Ye Clan.”

Bai Xiao heaved a sigh of relief, and said, “Since that’s the case, let’s return to the main hall.”

Bai Xiao admired Bai Shuying, and was concerned for her safety. All of the Bai Clan’s geniuses were gathered in the main hall. As a last resort, the Bai Clan would withdraw from the Nether Orchid Courtyard and the Heavenly Dao Sect. The losses might be huge if they retreated because they wouldn’t be able to return again. But at least most of them would still be alive.

So in Bai Xiao’s point of view, there was no need for Bai Shuying to put her life at risk. Based on her aptitude as a holy maiden, she should be the hope of the Bai Clan’s rise in the future.

“The Ye Clan probably doesn’t know what the Celestial Pool represents, but it’s extremely important in the eyes of those who know,” Bai Shuying said. She had guessed that the Ye Clan was probably a diversion, and there weren’t many who knew about the secrets of the Celestial Pool. If no one paid attention to it, the Solar Lunar Divine Rune might be taken away without anyone realizing it.

“Since that’s the case, let’s tell the ancestor about it,” Bai Xiao said.

But Bai Shuying wore a wry smile. The Solar Lunar Divine Rune was a Sovereign Saint Artifact, so why would the Bai Clan’s ancestor allow it to remain in the Heavenly Dao Sect if he knew?

“We still haven’t reached that step yet. Gather the Golden Guards. The Celestial Pool has restrictions and arrays, so it should be enough for Quasi-Saints to guard it.” Bai Shuying hoped that her speculation was true, and that not many people knew about the secrets of the Sovereign Divine Artifact.

This was an intuition because it would easily cause an internal strife if too many people knew about the Sovereign Divine Rune. At that time, even the Wang Clan and Ye Clan, who seemed to have a good relationship, might fight amongst themselves because of it. At that time, even the Bai Clan, who planned to leave, might interfere as well.

She began to wonder how Ye Qingtian was doing.

Bai Xiao received his orders and left while Bai Shuying went to the Celestial Pool alone. When she reached the foot of the mountain, she couldn’t help thinking about Ye Qingtian. She initially wanted to talk to Ye Qingtian when the ceremony ended, but chaos came too quickly, and she had no room to be concerned about her feelings.

A few minutes later, Bai Xiao appeared before Bai Shuying along with twenty-odd guards outside the Celestial Pool. The Golden Guards were the elites of the Heavenly Dao Sect, and they were all elites amongst saint disciples. They all looked young, but they were over a hundred years old, and there were even Quasi-Saints who were three hundred years old.

“Holy Maiden, I can only bring this many people over. We’re lacking people everywhere,” Bai Xiao sighed.

“We pay our greetings to the Holy Maiden!” The Golden Guards cupped their hands together. Although Bai Shuying was disliked amongst the elders, she had a high prestige amongst the younger generation. Aside from her talent, there was also her master, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

“This many people won’t affect the Nether Orchid Sword Array, right?” Bai Shuying asked.

“Of course not. I naturally know what to do,” Bai Xiao quickly replied. Taking this many people would have some impact, but it wouldn’t be that great.

“I’ll have to trouble you guys, then,” Bai Shuying cupped her hands together.

“Holy Maiden, please be assured. We will station here, and we won’t regret it even if a Saint comes,” the Golden Guards responded in unison, looking determined.

Outside the Nether Orchid Courtyard, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign stood on a mountain with two elders from the Ye Clan beside him. They were releasing their terrifying Saint Sovereign auras. Behind the three were eight Saint Lords waiting for the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign’s orders.

A hundred miles in front of them, the other Saint Sovereign of the Ye Clan led seven Saint Lords and hundreds of Quasi-Saints to attack the Nether Orchid Sword Array.

The Ye Clan was deeply rooted in the Heavenly Dao Sect, and they were strong. If Ye Qingyu and Ye Guhan were included, they could easily suppress the other three clans.

The Nether Orchid Sword Array was like a massive Nether Orchid Flower, and each petal was as sharp as a sword. At the bud of the flower, there were stars shining within.

The Ye Clan used many saint artifact and secret treasures, but they still couldn’t destroy the layers of petals.

“The Nether Orchid Sword Array involves Life Dao, and the petals are endless. Even a Great Saint will have a hard time breaking through it.” The old man on the right of the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign spoke up. This person was the Grand Elder of the Ye Clan, known as the Absolute Nether Saint Sovereign, and his strength wasn’t any weaker than the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign.

The other Saint Sovereign was called the Stun Yang Saint Sovereign, the son of the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign with an age of over a thousand years old. He asked, “Father, do you want to use the Heavenly Flame Cauldron?”

“There’s no need to hurry. Absolute Nether, why don’t you give it a try. Your Nether Sacred Flame has been cultivated for eight hundred years, and it’s time to bring up the heat,” the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign said. He briefly paused, before he looked at the Stun Yang Saint Sovereign, “Is Mister Ghost ready? The moment the array breaks, he should release those things.”

Mister Ghost was a demonic cultivator, a guest hired by the Ye Clan, and he had been friends with the Tough Peak Great Saint for hundreds of years. This was because the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign had given his all in this gamble. If he won, he would be able to receive 30% of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda’s resources and the position of the Dao Yang Palace’s palace master.

If the Bai Clan retreats, the Ye Clan could use this opportunity to take down the Nether Orchid Courtyard. As for the Profound Maiden Courtyard, it would also belong to the Ye Clan after the Serene Dust Great saint leaves. This was why the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign risked everything for this gamble. The risk was high, but it would be worth it if they won.

“Everyone is prepared. We’re just waiting for the array to be breached,” the Stun Yang Saint Sovereign said in excitement.

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign nodded, then looked at the Dao Yang Palace, “The battle is still ongoing at the Dao Yang Palace. It looks like the Gale Rein Great Saint is doing a good job over there.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But he had no idea that the Blood Moon Sect had colluded with the Demonspirit Clan. This made him feel relaxed because he would feel uneasy if everything went too smoothly. This would have meant that the Blood Moon Sect was too powerful.

As he spoke, the Absolute Nether Saint Sovereign soared to the sky and summoned his constellation, releasing a Netherflower that reached over a hundred feet with black flames blazing on it. As the Absolute Nether Saint Sovereign clasped his hands together to form seals, the nearby life force gradually withered. When he pointed his finger, the Netherflower petals flew over to the Nether Orchid Sword Array.
