Chapter 598 - Winner, Lin Yun

Yang Fan and Guo Xu were looking at Lin Yun’s silhouette as they circulated the origin energy in their bodies. They were acting calm, but the depths of their eyes reflected their killing aura. Then again, they had concealed the killing aura in their eyes very well. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

But the moment they made a decision, they could launch their strongest moves in a split second. They were both waiting to see how Lin Yun would respond to Yang Fan. After all, Yang Fan’s words sounded so normal that it would be hard to detect the danger in them if one wasn’t paying attention.

The moment Lin Yun relaxed, the two of them would launch their strongest attacks at Lin Yun. They were both geniuses on the rankings, so they wouldn’t go easy against a monstrous genius like Lin Yun.

“What is it?” But to their surprise, Lin Yun turned around and faced Yang Fan. He didn’t choose to escape immediately nor did he continue to face the two with his back. Instead, he had turned around and faced Yang Fan head-on.

The smile on Yang Fan’s face froze briefly as he began to wonder if Lin Yun sensed his killing aura.

A cold light flashed in Guo Xu’s eyes beside and he smiled, “Nothing much. Brother Yang is interested in your jade slip. Why don’t you come over and let us all look at it?”

As he spoke, he also began to walk over casually. At this moment, Yang Fan also reacted as he helped Guo Xu cover up their scheme with a smile, “Let’s share our jade slips. I believe you’re also interested in the ancient cultivation technique in my hands.”

Without any changes on his face, Lin Yun raised his brow, “Of course, but if you want to take a look at my jade slip, then I’ll have to trouble Brother Yang to come over by himself.”

As he spoke, he glanced at Guo Xue who had taken two steps forward. In the next second, a buzz rang in Guo Xu’s mind. It felt like there were countless swords hovering before him and that the sword intent would come after him if he dared to take another step forward.

Under the immense pressure, Guo Xu cursed inwardly as he stopped moving. He no longer dared to take another step. As for Yang Fan, he also began to hesitate when Lin Yun asked him to go over.

“Brother Yang, did you injure your leg earlier? Since that’s the case, then I’ll come over,” said Lin Yun as he sneered inwardly and approached Yang Fan.

“Stop right there!” Yang Fan’s face suddenly changed and he barked quickly. But shortly after, Yang Fan knew that he had overreacted and smiled, “Now that I think about it again, it’s fine. You can leave.”

Glancing at Yang Fan and Guo Xu, Lin Yun turned around and left without any hesitation.

When Lin Yun’s figure disappeared at the entrance, the bizarre atmosphere looming on Yang Fan and Guo Xu finally dissipated. Right now, Yang Fan and Guo Xu felt heavily relieved. The confrontation might have seemed peaceful, but only they knew how ferocious it was.

“That fellow’s terrifying. He actually wants to put his life on the line. Is he really that confident that he can take us down?” Guo Xu said with lingering fear. When Lin Yun wanted to come over, both Yang Fan and Guo Xu were startled.

They knew that Lin Yun had sensed their killing aura, but Lin Yun’s composure left them shocked.

Yang Fan was stunned for a long time before he said, “Forget about losing our lives, even the risk of being heavily injured isn’t something we can accept. We’re here for the empyrean’s tomb legacy and the Astral Pearl. No one is willing to give up on this opportunity. Plus, I was told a long time ago not to underestimate a swordsman who has grasped the xiantian sword intent.”

“Based on his courage alone, I’m not surprised that he can bring his sword intent to greater mastery,” added Guo Xu. Logically speaking, Lin Yun should be the one under pressure from them, but Lin Yun had clearly won the confrontation. They both had a flaw in their hearts, which was grasped by Lin Yun.

Shaking his head, Yang Fang said in a grave voice, “There are more and more geniuses these days. It’s uncertain if you and I can still be on the ranking after this Draconic Banquet.”

“Isn’t that why we’re in the Withernorth Sea? If I’ve guessed correctly, you could have made a breakthrough into the Yin-Yang stage long ago, right?” Guo Xu said with a light flickering in his eyes.

“It’s not easy trying to get the Astral Pearl with Ji Wuye and Yan Kong around,” responded Yang Fan.

After Lin Yun left the chambers, he began to search for the exit. Along the way, he ran into many corpses. Looking at this scene, Lin Yun sighed, “Every time a treasure appears, there will be many deaths.”

Take the previous moment, for example. He had just finished working with Guo Xu and Yang Fan to kill the zombies, but in the next second, they both considered him a threat after seeing the Thunderbolt Slasher. But since Lin Yun had chosen this path, he wouldn’t hesitate. If there was no path ahead of him, he would simply open a new path with the sword in his hand.

Without realizing it, he got to the far end of the tunnel and saw a door blocking his way. “A door?”

This was somewhat surprising. There were many split ways along the way, but Lin Yun rarely ever ran into such a complete door. But thinking about the battle with the zombies earlier, Lin Yun didn’t dare to lower his guard. But just when he was hesitating, the door suddenly opened as a figure pounced at him.

Lin Yun couldn’t see the creature’s appearance clearly, but he could roughly guess that it was a humanoid demonic beast like apes or zombies. Since Lin Yun was already guarded, he threw out a punch calmly.

The creature began to retreat under Lin Yun’s punches and it didn’t take long for Lin Yun to tear the creature apart. After the creature died, Lin Yun slowly raised his head and stepped into the door.

There was a secret chamber behind the door and Lin Yun could instantly sense a weak spiritual energy fluctuation here. But before he could think, black coffins broke apart and dozens of zombies pounced over at him.

There might be many zombies, but they weren’t on the same level as those Green-eyed Zombies.

Omnipresent Anger, Raging Sky!

Lin Yun threw out two moves from the Seven Slaughtering Fist and his killing aura began to surge.

Defiant Frustration, Resonation!

With a roar from Lin Yun, his punches cleared up all the zombies in the chamber. But under the force of Lin Yun’s punches, cracks began to spread out in the chamber.

“This damned place is really dangerous,” sighed Lin Yun as he began to search the chamber. However, there was nothing here. Then again, Lin Yun wasn’t surprised because those zombies were a lot weaker than the Green-eyed Zombies. In the end, Lin Yun made up his mind to leave quickly.

Half a day later, Lin Yun finally saw light at the far end of the tunnel. When he came out of the tunnel, he leapt a few times before landing on a sand dune. When he turned back around to look at the exit of the tunnel, he saw the tunnel slowly being devoured by sand.

He had no idea if this underground palace had other exits. Otherwise, Yang Fan and Guo Xu would be trapped for some time. Then again, the sand dune he was standing on also wasn’t safe.

Lin Yun spread his arms apart and bolted away with the Seven Profound Steps. When he landed on a few large rocks in a remote corner, Lin Yun looked around cautiously before he gently patted his interspatial pouch and retrieved the bottle containing the Profound Yin Water.

“It’s time for me to make my breakthrough.” Lin Yun could already make his breakthrough, but he held back because of the Profound Yin Water. But since he had obtained it, then it was natural for him to refine it early.

If he had cultivation in the Yang stage, he could face those geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking in the empyrean’s tomb. Yang Fan and Guo Xu had both revealed their killing aura earlier and if the Flower Burial Sword wasn’t in the crucial moment of upgrading, the difference between him and them wouldn’t be so great.

Otherwise, Lin Yun would never leave so easily with his temper. He would surely teach both of them a lesson in the future. As for the jade slip, Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to learn it right now. The Seven Profound Steps might be lacking behind his current realm right now, but it was adequate since it was in the Manifestation stage. He could start learning the new technique it after leaving the Withernorth Sea.

He knew that he wouldn’t be disappointed since it was an ancient martial technique. When Lin Yun looked at the jade bottle, his eyes glowed and as he muttered, “Time to refine the Profound Yin Water. I really want to see what makes it so special.”
