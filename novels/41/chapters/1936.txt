Chapter 1937 - Secluded Disciple (1)

After hearing what the Dragon Origin Great Saint said, Lin Yun maintained his composure. This was because he was already prepared and cautious when facing experts at the Saint Realm and was already on his guard when the Dragon Origin Great Saint was beating around the bush.

Nurturing him into a Sword Emperor? His master, the Radiant Sword Saint, said that if he wanted to become an Emperor, he would either reach the same height as the Nine Emperors or surpass them. The Nine Emperors might be legends, but that didn’t mean legends couldn’t be broken.

The Radiant Sword Saint was a Sword Saint, while the Dragon Origin Great Saint wasn’t a swordsman. So how was he going to nurture him into a Sword Emperor? So he figured that the Dragon Origin Great Saint must’ve suspected his identity after watching his performance earlier.

Lin Yun soon came up with an idea and smiled, “Master, what are you talking about? I’m naturally the Indigo Thunder Peak’s Ye Qingtian.”

When the Dragon Origin Great Saint saw that Lin Yun was so composed, he began to doubt if he had guessed wrongly. He said, “Ye Qingtian, I have already noticed something wrong about you at first glance. But the Azure River Sword Saint brought you back, so I do not need to doubt you. So it doesn’t matter if you’re genuinely Ye Qingtian, and I won’t mind it since I’ve accepted you as my disciple. Since I want to nurture you into a Sword Saint, I naturally have to teach you everything I know. I don’t mind who you are, but I need to know your identity, at the very least. Otherwise, where will I go to find you if you leave? You can’t expect me to teach you everything I know, then you suddenly leave, right?”

As he spoke, he observed Ye Qingtian and was disappointed because the latter didn’t panic.

“So master doesn’t believe that I can change in a year. Since that’s the case, I guess the fate between us has come to an end, and I have nothing to say about it,” Lin Yun said with a painful expression and tossed the Great Saint’s disciple medal back to the Dragon Origin Great Saint. He cupped his hands together, “Farewell!”

The moment he turned around, he let out a breath of relief. Honestly, he felt that the Dragon Origin Great Saint was a pretty good person and even wanted to teach him everything he knew. But he wasn’t Ye Qingtian, and he felt guilty for lying to him. So it was good that he could sever his connection with the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

“Come back!” Dragon Origin Great Saint yelled with regret covering his face. He knew Ye Qingtian suffered greatly a year ago and nearly lost his life. He had completely changed, and everyone wasn’t acknowledging his transformation.

He could only imagine how heartbroken Ye Qingtian must be that even he doubted his identity as his master. Most importantly, even he couldn’t see anything wrong with Ye Qingtian, let alone the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, who also suspected Ye Qingtian’s identity. So who else could he be if he wasn’t Ye Qingtian?

The Dragon Origin Great Saint stopped Lin Yun and said, “I’m sorry about that, but I have a reason for doing that. So listen to me before you leave.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched, and he had no choice but to turn around to look at the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint sighed, “Actually, that’s not exactly what I mean. It’s mainly because the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint appeared and paid attention to you. Back at the conferring ceremony, she came for you, and I’m worried that she’ll snatch you away. I said I wanted to nurture you into a Sword Emperor because I want you to calm down and prevent her from snatching you away. I apologize for doubting your identity.”

Looking at the regret on the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s face, Lin Yun was stumped. He didn’t know how to respond after seeing a Great Saint being so humble. He also didn’t know that the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign was taught a lesson for trying to take a peek at him with his saint eyes, and no one within the Heavenly Dao Sect would dare to peek at him with their saint eyes anymore in the future.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint was actually a protective person.

Lin Yun’s heart became soft, and he said, “Master, I was a little reckless earlier.”

“No, you’re not reckless.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint shook his head. “If I was in your position, I’d only be more heartbroken than you.”

Lin Yun fell silent, hearing what the Dragon Origin Great Saint said because it was all an act.

“Ye Qingtian, now that we’re going to be honest with each other, I’ll also make it clear to you. I want to take you in as my secluded disciple, which means I’ll teach you everything I know,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint smiled.

He felt that this was pretty good, and they had become closer, although they had a little misunderstanding. This meant that they could completely trust each other now.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint sighed, “I’ll be honest with you. I don’t have much lifespan left, and I’ll die if I can’t break into the Emperor Realm within a hundred years.”

“How is that possible?” Lin Yun was shocked.

No matter how he looked at it, the Dragon Origin Great Saint had a powerful vitality, and it didn’t look like his lifespan was ending. A hundred years might be a long time, but it was insignificant to a Great Saint.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint smiled, “There’s nothing to be shocked about. I became a Saint with my physique. I suffered many injuries in my early days because of my blatant fighting style. But you don’t have to feel sad because death is nothing to me. I just found it a pity that I can’t pass down all of my knowledge before I die. A Golden Era is imminent, and I won’t be able to participate in it. But if my disciple can shine brightly and learn all my knowledge, I’ll be satisfied even if I die.”

“Master…” Lin Yun said in a sobbing tone.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint took out the medal that Lin Yun tossed over and handed it back. He said, “Ye Qingtian, are you willing to become my secluded disciple?”

Lin Yun fell silent, looking at the medal with trembling hands. He never thought that the Dragon Origin Great Saint would confide in him, which couldn’t help making him feel guilty. He didn’t dare to receive the medal.

“Ye Qingtian, are you still angry?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint said with his brows furrowed.

Lin Yun sighed and said, “How can I be angry? But…”

“You’re not willing to become my secluded disciple?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint asked.

Lin Yun had no choice but to cup his hands and be honest. He said, “It’s not that I’m not willing, but I’m not worthy. You’re right, and I’m not Ye Qingtian!”

He didn’t dare to look at the Dragon Origin Great Saint, fearing the latter might be disappointed.

“But your words and your expression earlier…” The Dragon Origin Great Saint said with his face changed.

“It was all an act,” Lin Yun said, lowering his head even more.

“Who are you, then?!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint said with his hands trembling and his face becoming ugly.

Lin Yun was helpless because he no longer wanted to lie to the Dragon Origin Great Saint. He slowly raised his head and took three steps back before dismissing the Divine Tortoise Transformation.

As his bones crackled, a different face appeared before the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

This was an unfamiliar and handsome face. He might not be as ‘pretty’ as Ye Qingtian, but his temperament was slightly higher. The purple mark on his forehead gave him a devilish aura. No matter how the Dragon Origin Great Saint looked at him, this face looked way better than Ye Qingtian.

“Disciple is from the Profound Amber Realm, and I arrived in the Kunlun Realm through the Ninth Heavenly Path. My name is Lin Yun,” Lin Yun said, heaving a breath and feeling relaxed.

“Lin Yun?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint exclaimed in shock. “The Champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path?”

“That’s me.”

“First of the Empyrean, Elysium Core, and Dragon Pulse Rankings?”

“That’s me.”

“The one who slayed a Saint Sovereign at the Dragon Pulse Realm and killed the Nether Divinity Ancestor with the Firmament Saint Cloth?”

“That’s me…” Lin Yun admitted it honestly.

“What?!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint laughed from his anger. A brief moment later, he said with a self-mocking smile, “I nearly took the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple as my secluded disciple!”

He seemed to have a story with the Radiant Sword Saint, gritting his teeth when he mentioned the Radiant Sword Saint. The Dragon Origin Great Saint glared at Lin Yun with a dark expression and paced with his hands behind him.

This only made Lin Yun uneasy, and he didn’t know what awaited him. He could’ve chosen to accept the medal and could continue to hide his identity to become the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s secluded disciple. But he felt guilty if he continued to lie to the Dragon Origin Great Saint.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

This had always been Lin Yun’s personality. He would treat others how he was treated. Since the Dragon Origin Great Saint treated him well, he naturally didn’t want to lie to him. So he was willing to accept whatever the result would be.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint stopped and looked at Lin Yun, then said, “You’re really the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. He bluffed me, and now you’ve bluffed me.”

“What?” Lin Yun opened his mouth in disbelief.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint was still fuming, looking at Lin Yun. He said, “Do you know what kind of person your master is? He bluffed me in the past, and there’s nothing I can do about it because I can’t beat him. That old goat is despicable and shameless, but both the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint like him, and they weren’t even willing to look at me!”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched. He could sense a wisp of jealousy within the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s words.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint glared at Lin Yun and continued, “I was also a swordsman in the past, but your master conned me into practicing the Dracophant Saint Purgatory Art. Ultimately, he would stand behind me whenever we fight, letting me face the enemies head-on as a meatshield.”

“What has it got to do with me…?” Lin Yun muttered.

“You dare argue?!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint roared.

“I dare not,” Lin Yun said.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint snorted and fell silent, sorting out his thoughts. A brief moment later, he said, “I’ll give you two choices. Become my secluded disciple, and you can continue being Ye Qingtian. If you’re unwilling, stay in the Indigo Thunder Peak with your identity as Flower Burial.”

“This…” Lin Yun hesitated.

“What’s the matter? The Radiant Sword Saint is worthy of being your master, but I’m not? He can teach you sword dao, but can he teach you how to cultivate your physique?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint smiled. “I have already sensed that you’ve practiced the Dragon Clan’s body-refining technique. You should’ve practiced two body-refining techniques of the Dragon Clan, but you can’t combine them…”

Lin Yun raised his head and saw the Dragon Origin Great Saint looking at him with a smile, not fearing that he would disagree about becoming his disciple.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint’s smile was dense because snatching a disciple was more exciting than accepting a disciple, and he was determined to accept the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple as his disciple!
