Chapter 1530 - Disciple Is Useless! I Ask For Master To Save Me!

As Lil’ Red let out a ferocious roar, it released its aura as a Dragon Pulse Realm monarch demonic beast. All the envoys charging over were instantly injured since they were still at the Elysium Core Realm. They couldn’t have defeated Lil’ Red before it was at the Dragon Pulse Realm, not to mention that it had further strengthened its bloodline during its breakthrough.

A cold and domineering light flashed across Lil’ Red’s pupils as it swung the staff in its hands. With a simple swing, all the envoys, aside from An Liuyan and Tian Jue, were dead.

“This…” The other disciples of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion were stumped by this scene, with fear rising in their pupils.

“How did this happen…?” The Dragon Pulse Realm deacons were also frightened, with heartache reflected in their eyes. After all, even if those envoys couldn’t become the young lord, they were still the future foundation of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion, not to mention the astronomical sum of resources that the pavilion spent on them. They also didn’t expect the envoys to die when Lin Yun was heavily injured.

“Where did this dracoape come from?!” Tian Jue’s face was ugly, with the corner of his lips twitching. Who could have thought that Lin Yun not only had a demonic beast, but one possessing a monarch bloodline at that?

The face of the Samsara Edict Realm elder who led the Heavenly Astral Pavilion was ugly because he was placed in a tough position. He initially disagreed when Tian Jue wanting to threaten Lin Yun with An Liuyan, but he could do nothing because of Tian Jue’s identity as the first envoy. Now that they had practically lost all the envoys, it was a huge loss. Even if they managed to take the dragon bone back, it couldn’t make up for the loss, which was why his face was so ugly.

“Stop!” A decisive light flashed within Chang Cheng’s pupils as he stopped the Dragon Pulse Realm deacons who wanted to charge over.

Tian Jue’s eyes turned red as he yelled, “Elder Chang, make your move! If you make a move, you can kill him with a finger! How can we let all our envoys die just like that? Lin Yun has to die today, no matter what!”

But Chang Cheng merely glared at him before ignoring what he said. No Samsara Edict Realm expert here had the guts to make a move against Lin Yun anymore, not even those who lost their chief disciples. After all, they lost their Samsara Edict Realm experts, aside from those who were Kings, as a result.

Lin Yun had used a trump card given to him by Mu Xuankong, and no one could say that Lin Yun didn’t have another one. In reality, no Samsara Edict Realm expert would dare to make a move against Lin Yun aside from Qiu Qiong, not to mention the Dragon Pulse Realm experts.

Just the title of the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple was enough to intimidate many people, including saints. Not to mention that they were only Samsara Edict Realm Kings. In their eyes, Qiu Qiong wasn’t just arrogant; he was blind to dare to publicly make a move against Lin Yun.

The other Samsara Edict Realm experts briefly lost their rationale, and he dragged them down. So Chang Cheng naturally wouldn’t make a move against Lin Yun, nor did he dare to do it. As for the death of so many envoys, he could only swallow it down. It wasn’t because he didn’t want to take revenge, but he couldn’t.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It was fine if Tian Jue managed to kill Lin Yun because it was a battle between juniors, and even the Radiant Sword Saint couldn’t say a word about it. But if he made a move himself, this was a signal that it was fine for Sword Sect’s Samsara Edict Realm experts to make a move against their juniors.

So unless one could do it without anyone knowing, no one would be willing to break that rule because the consequences weren’t something anyone could accept. So no matter how Tian Jue called out for him, Chang Cheng simply ignored him.

“Good! Good! Good! Since you guys aren’t willing to make a move, I’ll do it myself!” Tian Jue said. His hate for Lin Yun naturally reached its peak. Most importantly, this was his only chance to kill Lin Yun.

If he allowed Lin Yun to fuse with the dragon bone again, he would lose the chance of taking revenge. Not to mention that Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t let him off. As waves of astral energy poured into the Heavenly Feather Blade in his hand, he knew that this was his only chance, or he would fall into the abyss.

That fellow is really courageous! The six demonic sects inwardly muttered in their hearts. Even now that Lin Yun was heavily injured and only had a demonic beast guarding him, no one dared to make a move. Let’s not mention the Radiant Sword Saint; just the medal given to him by Mu Xuankong was enough to speak for Lin Yun’s status in the sect.

Even Qiu Qiong only ordered the Netherworld Hall’s deacons to capture Lin Yun. So no one really dared to make a move against Lin Yun aside from juniors in the same generation as him. But Lin Yun had already slaughtered almost all the geniuses in his generation from the demonic sects, which meant that they could only watch Lin Yun fuse with the dragon bone, thus creating this bizarre moment.

So they were naturally willing to see Tian Jue make a move against Lin Yun, and it was best for Lin Yun to die in the hands of Tian Jue.

“Die!” Pushing his aura to the limit, Tian Jue charged over with his blade hacking down towards Lin Yun. This was a fatal blade; he had given his all in this attack, even the space around the blade had cracked.

Many Dragon Pulse Realm deacons were surprised by this attack, and Tian Jue really deserved his reputation as the first envoy. Lin Yun might have a demonic beast protecting him, but he couldn’t move right now. So the fluctuation of this blade was more than enough to kill Lin Yun.

But no one had thought that when Tian Jue charged over, the dracoape was already standing in his way and easily destroyed Tian Jue’s attack. Everyone could see that the blade ray was dimming, and Tian Jue was still ultimately lacking; he wasn’t strong enough to take Lin Yun’s life.

Suddenly, a bizarre scene occurred. A figure flew past the dracoape. His attack earlier was a façade right from the beginning to attract Lil’ Red’s attention. When Lil’ Red blocked his attack, he didn’t hesitate to throw the Heavenly Feather Blade away and jumped over its head.

Lil’ Red didn’t have enough time to turn around. When Lil’ Red let out a roar and reached out to grab Tian Jue, Tian Jue easily avoided it as if he had eyes in the back of his head.

“Hahaha!” Tian Jue laughed. When Lil’ Red turned around, he was just a step away from Lin Yun, and Lin Yun would be killed by his palm as long as he took another step forth.

“Lin Yun, I bet you never thought you’d die in my hands, right?!” Tian Jue took a step forth and raised his palm. When his palm landed on Lin Yun’s head, Tian Jue suddenly threw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away.

“What’s going on?” Tian Jue’s face changed, and he was shocked by this scene. When he raised his head, a blue dragon enveloped Lin Yun, who looked like a soul.

This signified that Lin Yun had merged with the Blue Dragon Bone. When Lin Yun opened his pupils, a terrifying outburst of draconic aura swept out from his pupils, enveloping Tian Jue in fear. It was as if he was facing an actual divine dragon.

“Thanks to you, my soul has completely fused with this dragon bone.” Lin Yun calmly looked at Tian Jue.

Tian Jue threw out a mouthful of blood and wanted to flee for his life. But Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t let him off. He reached out and said, “Get back here!”

As a powerful suction force exploded from the Azure Dragon Grasp, ripples spread out in space, and a bloody scene occurred. As thunderstorms gathered in Lin Yun’s palm when he poured the dragon runes into this attack, Tian Jue was being dragged back while being torn into pieces.

This was a painful process, but Lin Yun’s pupils were cold. He wanted Tian Jue to die the most painful death. He had already decided on this when he slapped An Liuyan earlier.

Following Tian Jue’s screams, An Liuyan also felt a chill run down her spine, and her hand was trembling as she grabbed onto Lin Yun’s hand. In the end, Tian Jue was completely shredded into pieces and the surroundings fell silent.

“Does the Heavenly Astral Pavilion have any opinion about me leaving with her?” Lin Yun looked at Chang Cheng. He was at the Elysium Core Realm, while the other party was a King. But this didn’t mean Lin Yun didn’t have the confidence to speak to Chang Cheng directly.

The Heavenly Astral Pavilion’s party was shocked by Lin Yun. Chang Cheng widened his mouth. He wanted to speak, but his words were stuck in his throat. If he agreed, it meant he took an order from Lin Yun. If he refused, this would flip the table against Lin Yun and the Radiant Sword Saint.

When Lin Yun saw this scene, he turned to look at Xiao Yun’s direction, “Let him go.”

When the Dragon Pulse Realm deacons all looked at Chang Cheng, the latter nodded. But just when the three of them were about to leave, Qiu Qiong’s cold voice resounded, “The Heavenly Astral Pavilion might have agreed to let you leave, but I don’t remember agreeing to it!”

“Old goat, don’t push it!” Lin Yun said in a solemn voice. He didn’t want to use his last trump card if he could resolve it himself. But Qiu Qiong kept pushing it and even wanted to make a move against him, disregarding his identity.

“Hmph, cut the nonsense. I have to obtain the Blue Dragon Bone no matter what!” Qiu Qiong said. “You better hand it over. Others might fear the Radiant Sword Saint, but not me. He’s already old, and he doesn’t have long to live. Do you think he can descend here with a clone in his current state?”

The corner of Lin Yun's lips twitched, and his face was terrifyingly cold. An Liuyan could feel Lin Yun’s dilemma when she held onto his hand.

“Don’t try to have any funny thoughts. Not to mention that the Radiant Sword Saint can’t descend himself. Even if he can, I’m not afraid of him!” Qiu Qiong coldly said, and his words were equivalent to taking extreme means. The other Samsara Edict Realm elders were shocked when they heard that because Qiu Qiong was being a little too arrogant.

When he was done speaking, he laughed when he saw Lin Yun going down on his knees. He was under the impression that Lin Yun was kneeling to him, but he still had no intentions of letting Lin Yun go.

But who knew that Lin Yun didn’t look at him and took out a painting instead. “Disciple is useless! I ask for Master to save me!”
