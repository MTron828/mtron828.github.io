Chapter 1816 - I Know Who Is He

Mei Zihua was surprised when Kou Tianhua suddenly made a move against him. After all, he was the descendant of one of the Ten Musical Clans, and no one dared to not give him face back in the Divine Dragon Empire.

Even in the massive Kunlun Realm, only a handful of people could grasp the Divine Dragon Tune, and they were all powerful Emperors. But this was obviously ineffective in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. At the very least, Kou Tianhua didn’t fall for it.

This caught Mei Zihua by surprise. He took several steps back and nearly fell to the ground. After all, he was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm. So he couldn’t put up any resistance against Kou Tianhua, who’s at the Profound Life Stage, without his musical instrument.

“You want to protect him with this level of strength? Get lost. If I had any intention of killing you, you’d already be a dead person now.” Kou Tianhua said coldly. The baleful aura he released was like blood, and Kou Tianhua wasn’t bragging. After all, he was the disciple of the Whitebone Blade Saint, and he would’ve drawn his blade if he wanted to make a move. But he didn’t take Mei Zihua’s life because of his background.

Mei Zihua’s face changed, clutching his chest, and couldn’t raise his head.

“Brother, can you do it?” Gu Jun couldn’t help asking. Everyone in the surrounding area was stunned because there was a drastic difference between what Mei Zihua said and his strength.

Kou Tianhua looked at Mei Zihua in disdain before he turned to Lin Yun and carried on walking forth with a snort.

“Wait.” Mei Zihua reached out, stopping Kou Tianhua while he slowly raised his head. When he slowly pushed his hands forth, he threw out a mouthful of blood.

After throwing out the mouthful of blood, he felt more relieved, and he wiped the blood off his lips. He smiled, “Looks like my face isn’t effective in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. But I advise you guys not to take another step forth.”

Kou Tianhua couldn’t be bothered to deal with him, and continued walking forth.

“I told you to stop!” Mei Zihua smiled, and pushed his palm forth. His palm looked like an ordinary palm, but it swept over with a boundless aura as a palm descended. When he shook his wrist, it formed into a powerful gale, forming into some sort of melody-wrecking chaos between heaven and earth.

As a ruthless light flashed across Kou Tianhua’s pupils, he clenched his fist, and his baleful aura formed into a demonic cauldron. When the demonic cauldron emitted a crimson radiance, it flew forward. He only wanted to teach Mei Zihua a lesson. But since Mei Zihua was so stubborn, he didn’t mind giving him another lesson to show that the Ten Musical Clans were nothing in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea.

But when the demonic cauldron landed on the hurricane, it stopped and there was an invisible wind blocking the cauldron like a towering mountain. Amidst the huge buzzing noise, Kou Tianhua’s demonic cauldron shattered, and astonishment was written on Kou Tianhua’s face.

After resolving the demonic cauldron, Mei Zihua took a step forth, and came before Kou Tianhua. The two exchanged over ten-odd moves, and the explosions they created in their fight turned into a musical note hovering in the air.

Mei Zihua didn’t move, but Kou Tianhua took ten steps back before he stabilized his foothold. He could feel his arms becoming numb with a humming sound in his ears. His sea of consciousness was in a mess, and his mental energy suffered a huge blow.

“Great Saint Tune!” Kou Tianhua said with disbelief.

But Mei Zihua merely stood there and calmly said, “Kou Tianhua, you have some abilities, but you still can’t beat me with your cultivation. I’ll be honest with you. If I’m willing, the three of you together won’t be my opponent.”

Everyone in the surroundings was shocked as they looked at Mei Zihua. The fact that he could grasp the Great Saint Tune meant he was at least an eleventh-grade Saint Spiritualist. If he paired it with ancient scores, even those at the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage wouldn’t be able to touch him.

Mei Zihua was confident and arrogant, just like how he was when he arrived at Dual Moon Lake. After intimidating everyone, he turned to Lin Yun and smiled, “Brother Lin, no one will dare to touch you with me around, at least here on the Profound Thunder Island!”

But Lin Yun had no change on his face and had an ill premonition because this person was full of himself, which made him a little unreliable.

As Kou Tianhua’s facial expression became dark, he coldly said, “Great Saint Tune, impressive. But I have yet to draw my blade. Do you think you can protect Lin Xiao? Don’t bother with him and slaughter Lin Xiao! Whoever kills him gets the Demonfeather Order!”

His words were instigative. All of the demonic cultivators were here for the Demonfeather Order. Even if Mei Zihua’s Great Saint Tune was strong, could he possibly block all of them?

When a group of people approached, the surrounding atmosphere became oppressive, as if a terrifying war was about to break out.

When Mei Zihua saw so many people charging over, his arrogance disappeared, and he took several steps back. It didn’t take long for him to retreat to Lin Yun’s side, wearing an embarrassed expression.

Gu Jun’s face was ugly because he was afraid of this situation, and began to roll his eyes around trying to find an opportunity to escape.

Lin Yun also sighed in his heart because this wasn’t what he wanted to see. But there was nothing he could do now, and he couldn’t blame Mei Zihua’s goodwill for it.

“Who dares to make a move!” A roar echoed, and everyone felt as though there was a dragon’s roar in their ears, which made them stagger.

As a graceful black figure descended from the sky, she held onto a fan with a white dragon coiling around her. She looked bewitching, yet, heroic at the same time. She was naturally An Liuyan.

After An Liuyan arrived, she waved her fan down, and the fan flew out like a white dragon, causing four heads to fly with blood splashing around.

With a wave of her hand, An Liuyan recalled the fan back to her. This act intimidated many people. This scene immediately made many people retreat.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Boss An, are you also here to compete for the Demonfeather Order?” Kou Tianhua squinted his eyes, but he had a wisp of fear within his pupils when he looked at An Liuyan. He didn’t dare to be so casual any longer.

An Liuyan’s identity on the surface was the young pavilion master of the Heavenly Star Pavilion, and this alone was enough to intimidate many demonic cultivators in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. But according to the rumors, she even had another identity as one of the Nine-Star Demon Venerables in the Eastern Desolation’s Demon Gate. If that was true, it would be too terrifying.

But An Liuyan didn’t care about Kou Tianhua and said, “Give me face and ignore the Demonfeather Order while you’re on Profound Thunder Island. In the future, if you guys need any help, you can look for me at the Heavenly Star Pavilion. But it’s fine if you guys don’t want to give me face because I have ways to dig out everything about you.”

The surrounding demonic cultivators’ faces changed, and they began to hesitate. They could not give Mei Zihua face, but An Liuyan was a different story. She gave a threat and benefit at the same time.

The demonic cultivators here could ignore the holy lands, but they would have to reconsider when it came to the Demon Gate. After all, the Demon Gate didn’t have that much reservation, when compared to holy lands.

“Since Boss An already said it, we naturally have to give you face.”

“Boss An, don’t worry about it. We won’t touch Lin Xiao on Profound Thunder Island, but it’s a different story when we’re out.”

“...” The surrounding demonic cultivators spoke out. They had to give An Liuyan face no matter what.

A brief moment later, the demonic cultivators all left. Only Kou Tianhua and a few others stayed behind because they were placed in a difficult position. Kou Tianhua wasn’t afraid of An Liuyan, but he wasn’t confident about dealing with Lin Yun’s party now that An Liuyan came.

“Boss An, we’ll wait and see!” Kou Tianhua was a decisive person, and left after letting out some sinister laughter. With that, the tension in the surroundings disappeared.

“Young Master, I’m late.” An Liuyan came forth.

“Let’s leave this place first.” Lin Yun could sense many gazes on him in the dark, so this wasn’t the place for them to talk. He had long discovered the man with the bamboo hat, and this person didn’t even bother concealing himself.

Aside from him, there were some people hidden in the dark, but he couldn’t detect much, even with the Sword Heart. The aura those people gave off were strong, even stronger than the demonic cultivators on the Demonic Ranking.

“Yeah, I know a place.” An Liuyan nodded.

“Lead the way, then.” Lin Yun followed behind An Liuyan. When the old man saw An Liuyan, his face was immediately plastered with a smile before following behind them. After all, he obtained a lot in the hands of An Liuyan, and he had a better impression of her than Lin Yun.

Meanwhile, Mei Zihua was left in an awkward position because no one called him.

An Liuyan glanced at Lin Yun, but Lin Yun merely walked quietly. This made Mei Zihua even more anxious because he wanted someone to give him face and invite him over. When he saw that Lin Yun’s party was already far away, he quickly chased after them.

It didn’t take long for him to catch up to Lin Yun’s party. When he saw Lin Yun suddenly coming to a stop, he had joy on his face because Lin Yun at least had some conscience to wait for him.

“Young Master, what’s the matter?” An Liuyan asked doubtfully.

“Someone is following us.” Lin Yun turned around and looked at the youth wearing a bamboo hat following behind them from afar. When their gazes bumped, the other party finally retreated.

“Who’s that person?” An Liuyan asked.

“He thought he had hidden himself well, but I already know who he is. There’s no need to care about him, for now.” Lin Yun said with a cold light flashing across his pupils.
