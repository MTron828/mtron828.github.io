Chapter 1210 - Perfect Couple

Aside from Luo Hua, everyone faced the immense pressure of the Lightning Shadow Sword. The Incineration Sword was tempting to a Dragon Pulse Realm expert, especially since it couldn’t be bought with money. A fine sword forged by Feng Xuanzi was a priceless saint artifact.

But even that sword was nothing in comparison to the Lightning Shadow Sword. The Lightning Shadow Sword was engraved with a divine rune. Naturally, Bai Ting would fall to his knees when he heard that the Lightning Shadow Sword was about to break.

Even Luo Hua couldn’t help feeling heartache for Lin Yun. After all, if the Lightning Shadow Sword broke, Lin Yun would have gone through the three rounds in vain. The scene of Lin Yun being stabbed by three swords was still deeply imprinted in her mind.

“Wait here. I’ll go and take a look.” Luo Hua spread her arms apart and soared into the sky, heading toward Lin Yun.

“Young Master Luo!” Bai Ting called out anxiously because no one knew Lin Yun’s current state was. If the Lightning Shadow Sword really broke, the power created in the explosion could even kill an expert in the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Back on the stage, Lin Yun was holding on with great difficulty because he couldn’t control the current situation. The Lightning Shadow Sword was competing with the ‘broken sword’ in his body, and he could sense that the Lightning Shadow Sword had unleashed its full prowess despite the fact that the ‘broken sword’ didn’t unleash much of its power.

This gave Lin Yun a headache. He now understood why this sword could be subdued by the old geezer. After all, the old geezer and the sword practically had the same temper. He wanted to put the sword back in its sheath, but the sword resisted him and fought with the ‘broken sword’ in his body.

As more cracks appeared on the sword, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling anxious. The cracks on the divine rune wouldn’t matter much because it would recover with enough time. But if the divine rune completely broke, the Lightning Shadow Sword would also break. He would only be able to fix it if he found the Mo Clan.

Letting out a ferocious roar, Lin Yun immediately executed all of his trump cards, including the remaining Demonic Astral Flowers within his body. As the Azure Dragon Mark ignited on his chest, it made his body comparable to a hundred rune saint artifact. At the same time, the quasi-divine firmament sword intent continued to hum in his forehead.

But it was a pity that Lin Yun had lost the majority of his Demonic Astral Flowers and sword intent through the battle. There was no way he could return to top form in such a short amount of time even though his injuries were healed.

Lin Yun was sheathing the Lightning Shadow Sword, but the speed was slower than the divine rune shattering. Sensing this, Lin Yun took a deep breath and a sword ray flickered in his eyes.

Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords—Myriad Sword Condensation!

As Lin Yun circulated the Fleeting Cloud Sword Art, the real holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords appeared once more. When the gigantic sword appeared, the pressure Lin Yun was feeling immediately lightened. But even so, the Lightning Shadow Sword didn’t submit to him. In fact, it retaliated with an even more terrifying sword ray.

“Behave yourself!” This was a rare opportunity and Lin Yun couldn’t let it go. But before he unleashed his full power, the Lightning Shadow Sword returned to its sheath right before the divine rune was about to shatter.

Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood as his face turned pale. At the same time, the azure sword became illusory. Even if he had reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, he still couldn’t bear summoning the holy spirit twice. Without enough vitality, he couldn’t summon the holy spirit for long.

“Holy shit. That nearly scared the shit out of me. If the Lightning Shadow Sword broke, even I would have felt heartache for it!” Lil’ Purple spoke with lingering fear in her voice. “Lin Yun, what’s wrong? Don’t scare me…”

Lin Yun was like a broken kite as he fell from the sky. From the height that he was falling, he would be crippled once he hit the ground. Perhaps he would become the first genius who died after falling from the sky. But a breeze suddenly blew past and Luo Hua grabbed him.. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“What are you doing here?” Lin Yun’s face was pale as he looked at Luo Hua who was embracing him.

“I was feeling heartache for you…” Luo Hua said. Her face couldn’t be seen due to the veil, but Lin Yun could sense the gentleness in her voice.

“It’s fine. I’ll be okay after a little rest,” smiled Lin Yun while taking a deep breath to allow the Nirvana Pellet to finish the healing process.

“Lin Yun, I don’t want to stay here any longer,” said Luo Hua. He could tell from her tone that she was disgusted with this plaza, disgusted with the Feng Clan, and disgusted with the environment of the Azure Rock Hidden Sword Pavilion.

“Then let’s go.” Lin Yun stood up with the Lightning Shadow Sword in his left hand. Then, he offered his right hand to Luo Hua.

“Okay, I’ll listen.” Luo Hua naturally reached out and grabbed onto Lin Yun’s hand as well.

“Let’s go!” Although Lin Yun looked exhausted, he looked extraordinary, especially with the purple mark on his forehead that made him look devilish. His appearance complimented Luo Hua so well that they looked like the perfect couple as they flew away.

Once the sword aura disappeared, everyone was able to stand up. Everyone watched Lin Yun fly away with Luo Hua next to him in disbelief. It was a scene they would never forget.

After Bai Ting recovered from his shock, his lips twitched. He couldn’t believe that they were leaving without him. “They’re going to leave just like that?”

He quickly got to his feet and ran after them. After all, he didn’t dare to stick around. At the same time, Zhao Yan and Ye Feifan chased after Bai Ting. Since the Sword Assembly was done and the Feng Clan was a mess, there was no reason to stick around. Although Lin Yun left holding hands with a beauty, everyone knew that his problems were just beginning. There was no way that Lin Yun could just leave with the Lightning Shadow Sword.

After leaving Feng Clan, Lin Yun and Luo Hua both descended from the sky. When they turned to look back, they were both filled with emotions. After all, neither of them could have anticipated all of the tribulations that Lin Yun faced.

“You should rest for the night.” Luo Hua then let go of Lin Yun’s hands and examined the wounds on his body.

Lin Yun nodded his head because he knew that subduing the Lightning Shadow Sword was even more tiring than the battles he faced. Although he managed to stabilize his injuries with the Nirvana Pellet, he could clearly sense that the effects of the Nirvana Pellet had declined.

“Let’s wait for Elder Bai Ting.” Lin Yun turned back to look at the gate because he still had to discuss the next steps with Elder Bai Ting. Soon enough, Elder Bai Ting rushed through the gate with a smile of relief.

“It’s good that the two of you are here.” Bai Ting smiled before his gaze fell onto the Lightning Shadow Sword and whispered, “Erm, that sword didn’t break, right?”

“Nope.” Lin Yun smiled. “But the divine rune is damaged, and it needs time to repair itself.”

A divine rune and saint rune weren’t the same. Saint runes required spiritualists to repair them while divine runes could repair themselves. This was also the reason why divine runes could be preserved through the ancient era.

Feeling relieved, Bai Ting smiled, “Good. Good. I haven’t sent a report to the sect master yet. We can stay with the Huang Clan for the night while we wait for the sect master’s instructions.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he knew that the Feng Clan wouldn’t let the Lightning Shadow Sword go. Furthermore, there would also be many people planning to go after the sword.

“What about the ranking battle of the Profound Azure Prefecture?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts.

Bai Ting’s face changed and said, “This… it’s disadvantageous for you because you’re still not an empyrean. You’ll have a hard time competing with Astral Stage experts.”

Bai Ting was right. The only reason why Lin Yun had success in the Sword Assembly was because everyone restricted their cultivation to the Heavenly Soul Realm. Although he defeated many people in the top 3,000, all of them had restricted their cultivation. Truthfully, he might not be able to defeat Feng Xingyan or Zhao Yan without the restriction, let alone Gongsun Yan. After all, there was a huge gap in their cultivation, and Lin Yun’s trump cards wouldn’t do anything.

“I just need one night,” said Lin Yun. Lin Yun had stayed in the Heavenly Soul Realm for a long time, and he could also make use of this opportunity to digest his harvest in the Sword Assembly.

“Isn’t that a little too rushed?” Bai Ting asked.

“Brother Lin!”

“Big Brother Lin!” Two people quickly came over and Lin Yun turned to face them. It was the carefree Ye Feifan and the serious Zhao Yan.
