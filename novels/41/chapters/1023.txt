Chapter 1024 - Arrival of a Storm

Seeing how furious Pei Xue became, Lin Yun seemed to realize something. However, he didn’t think too much about it. He had questions to ask her, but he had to wait for her to calm down.

Over the last three days, Lin Yun made huge improvements with his Iris Sword Sutra. It was about to reach the fourteenth stage.

The improvement in his sword sutra also allowed his sky sword sutra to improve. Now, it was practically at greater mastery. Additionally, his cultivation had reached the greater third soul Heavenly Soul Realm, which was one step away from the pinnacle. With the amount of Divine Astral Pellets that he had, it wouldn’t be hard to reach the pinnacle.

If someone else had a thousand Divine Astral Pellets, there was no way they could consume them all in three days. Only Lin Yun was carefree. However, it was his liberal use of Divine Astral Pellets that allowed his Divine Glorysun Fist and Divine Glorymoon Fist to touch the surface of a holy spirit martial technique.

Now, he could execute the holy spirit martial technique with the Flower Burial Sword. It was only by using the Flower Burial Sword that he could unleash the full power of the sky sword intent. Looking around, Lin Yun said cautiously, “Beauty Xue, it’s time for us to get going.”

They had been here for three days, so it was time to leave. The Yellow Sandy Plain might be huge, but there was no way they could face the search of the three war realms by standing still.

But Pei Xue was still angry with Lin Yun so she didn’t respond.

“This woman…” Lin Yun called Lil’ Red over and said, “You bring her.”

“Pigs, what are you trying to do!?” Pei Xue’s face changed when she saw Lil’ Red approaching her. After all, she had a bad impression of Lil’ Red. All of a sudden, Lil’ Red let out a roar and transformed into an ancient warhorse. Then, Lil’ Red circled Pei Xue several times.

“This…” Pei Xue was shocked because she never expected that Lil’ Red would have a second form.

“This is its original form. You’re too slow at traveling right now. Since you don’t want me to bring you around, then let Lil’ Red escort you,” smiled Lin Yun.

“I don’t…” Pei Xue whispered. She was only holding a grudge because Lin Yun called her a pig.

Placing her on Lil’ Red’s back, the two of them left the region. After all, waiting in the Yellow Sandy Plain for the war realms to find them wasn’t a solution to their problems.

At many times, everyone could only see several blurred lights throughout the Yellow Sandy Plain. After Lin Yun departed, he didn’t head towards Four Phase City. Instead, he was trying to leave the Yellow Sandy Plain. But in the end, he discovered a blockade. The blockade was controlled by a Realm Son who was emitting a terrifying aura. The Elysium Trigram Realm Son was in charge of this area.

Since Lin Yun didn’t want to start a conflict with a Realm Son too early, he changed directions. However, he found another Realm Son, so he turned around. Very quickly, Lin Yun discovered that all the paths were blocked aside from the path leading to Four Phase City. It appeared that the Realm Sons wanted him to go to Four Phase City. Lin Yun had a feeling that something wasn’t right.

Over the past few days, Lin Yun discovered that the atmosphere in the Yellow Sandy Plain was weird. Some people had found them but they didn’t emit any hostility. They wanted to come in contact with Lin Yun, but they left after some hesitation. Lin Yun even passed a few higher realms that fought with the subordinates of the war realms.

There were many people that were unhappy with being trapped by the war realms for so long. This instantly made Lin Yun feel that something wasn’t right.

Is it because of me? As long as I’m free, the three war realms will maintain the lockdown. Lin Yun didn’t feel good about implicating bystanders. With a frown, he pondered his choices.

“You’re not thinking of heading to Four Phase City, are you?” Pei Xue asked without receiving a response. Seeing how uncertain Lin Yun was, Pei Xue became anxious and yelled, “You’re not allowed to go there!”

Pei Xue’s sudden yell startled Lin Yun because he had no idea what was wrong with her. When Pei Xue realized she was yelling, she turned her head around and whispered, “You’re not allowed to go there.”

Clearly, the three Realm Sons were forcing Lin Yun towards Four Phase City. There was surely a scheme to claim Lin Yun’s life.

The Realm Sons must be confident that Lin Yun wouldn’t dare to start a conflict with them, so they came up with this plan. If Lin Yun showed up, they would have plenty of ways to deal with him.

Lin Yun and Pei Xue were intelligent, so they could guess the thoughts of the Realm Sons. The plan was so obvious, but it wasn’t like the Realm Sons were hiding their plan. However, Lin was a tad fearful because he wasn’t sure how strong the Realm Sons were.

If he fought them alone, he might be able to face them. However, if the Realm Sons also had a holy spirit martial technique, his chances would be a lot lower.

“Let’s go and see what they have planned,” said Lin Yun with killing intent in his voice. If it was only one of them, Lin Yun would have just left the Yellow Sandy Plain. But it wasn’t as easy with Pei Xue around.

“Stop dozing off. Since I rescued you, I’m going to get you out of here,” said Lin Yun in a firm tone. Before Pei Xue could refuse, Lin Yun sped towards Four Phase City. Pei Xue didn’t say a word because she realized that she might be holding Lin Yun back.

Along the way, Lin Yun would occasionally run into groups of people. All of them had reverence in their eyes as they watched Lin Yun. Instead of running away, one particular group mustered up the courage to talk to Lin Yun.

After hearing what they had to say, Lin Yun discovered that they wanted to express their goodwill. They told Lin Yun about his bounty from the Nether Divinity Realm Son. They also told him that Four Phase City was a trap.

Additionally, they reminded Lin Yun that if the war realms couldn’t find him, they would vent their anger on the other realms. Although they were furious, none of them betrayed Lin Yun. Not a single one of them wanted to claim Lin Yun’s bounty.

After hearing that, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly because he finally knew why the atmosphere in the Yellow Sandy Plain was so weird. He then thanked them before continuing forward. It was surprising, but Lin Yun was a responsible person. Since these problems started with him, he naturally had to fix things.

Two days later, Lin Yun ran into Chen Xun. Both parties were surprised to see each other and Lin Yun asked, “Where’s Luo Chen’s group?”

“They hid a long time ago. Someone exposed your relationship with them, so now the three war realms are looking for them,” replied Chen Xun.

When Lin Yun heard that, his gaze turned cold. Seeing Lin Yun’s reaction, Chen Xun replied, “Don’t worry about them. They’re not pushovers and they also obtained various opportunities in the Azure Dragon Palace. Ordinary servants aren’t their opponents.”

Lin Yun felt comforted. But Chen Xun looked at Lin Yun and asked, “Are you going to Four Phase City? It’s a trap. They seem determined to catch you both…” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Trap?” Lin Yun said coldly, “It’s still uncertain who will be trapped.”

Lin Yun was furious because the war realms crossed his bottom line. Chen Xun was stunned. Looking at Lin Yun’s back, Chen Xun knew that a huge storm was about to descend.

Furthermore, with the current repressed atmosphere in the Yellow Sandy Plain, no one knew what would happen when chaos ensued.
