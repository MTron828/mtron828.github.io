Chapter 1810 - Surprise?

Lin Yun was calm because what the Wind Edge Lord said was right. Even between two Glory Saint Artifacts of the same grade, a defensive artifact was naturally more valuable than an offensive artifact. Even if the weapon was at a higher grade, the value of a defensive artifact would be higher if they were placed on an auction. The difference might be several fold or even tenfold. After all, you only have one life, no matter how many people you kill.

“Good stuff.” Lin Yun’s pupils were blazing with flames when he looked at the Myriad Scales Armor. It was a defensive Glory Saint Artifact and wearing it was equivalent to having another life. He just didn’t know if it was forged with the scales of divine dragons or true dragons. If it was forged with the scales of divine dragons, he couldn’t imagine how valuable this Glory Saint Artifact would be.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The Wind Edge Lord’s pupils were full of pride, and he said, “For this Glory Saint Artifact, my father practically used life to exchange it. With it, you can only dream about injuring me as long as I stay here. My Silver Dragon Saint Physique can strengthen all my aspects, and you should’ve sensed that earlier, right?”

He was in the top ten, to begin with. After reaching the Profound Life Stage, he was even stronger than the elders. Now that he even had the Myriad Scales Armor on, he was practically invincible against those of the same cultivation.

Even someone at the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage couldn’t injure him. With the Myriad Scales Armor, he was confident of even leaving when facing a pinnacle Nirvana Stage expert. If he unleashed the true power of the Myriad Scales Armor, he could even fight them.

“Is a Glory Saint Artifact really invincible?” Lin Yun muttered. His dual sword souls then began to glow. When he raised his sword to the same level as his brows, the dual sword souls immediately empowered the Flower Burial Sword.

As a golden Azure Dragon coiled around the sword in his hand, the Flower Burial Sword flew out. This made the Wind Edge Lord wear a grave expression, and he didn’t dare to be careless.

After all, Lin Yun was a monstrous genius with the sword, and his sword was a Glory Saint Artifact. So he couldn’t afford to be careless, even with the Myriad Scales Armor.

The Wind Edge Lord circulated his Silver Dragon Saint Physique and dashed forth with his right fist. As a powerful dragon aura spread out from him, each of the scales on the Myriad Scales Armor emitted a dazzling light. Shortly after, multiple silver dragons flew out and sent the Flower Burial Sword away.

Lin Yun remained where he was and controlled the Flower Burial Sword with his right hand. The sword drew countless sword images in the air before the Flower Burial Sword broke through the silver dragons and arrived before the Wind Edge Lord.

As sparks flew around, the Wind Edge Lord was calm and the incoming attacks were blocked. He didn’t even stop Lin Yun from attacking him because the latter’s attacks could only cause sparks to fly on his body.

“Divine Dragon Overlord Fist!” As a dazzling silver radiance shone from the Wind Edge Lord, his punch manifested into a silver meteorite that bombarded the incoming swords. When a powerful shockwave swept out, all the swords were shattered, and the Flower Burial Sword was sent flying away.

Wielding the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun took three steps back before he managed to stabilize himself. When he looked at the Myriad Scales Armor, the flames within his eyes blazed even stronger, and he couldn’t help wearing a smile.

Even if he had a lot of treasures, he still couldn’t help feeling heated when he saw the Myriad Scales Armor and wanted to keep it for himself. Lin Yun simply put the sword back into the sheath and stood with his hands behind his back.

What the Wind Edge Lord said was right. He was practically invincible with the Myriad Scales Armor. It was close to impossible if he wanted to injure the Wind Edge Lord with the Flower Burial Sword.

Perhaps he might be able to injure his opponent with the Divine Firefly Sword, but there was no need. This was because this sword technique would consume a lot of vitality, not to mention his injuries weren’t light. Even with the Blue Dragon Bone, he couldn’t recover anytime soon.

As for using the Nine Lotus Diagram, it was too unrealistic. Firstly, it takes time to cast the Nine Lotus Saint Seal. Secondly, Liu Cheng was still inside, and he didn’t know if that fellow was dead. But he had an easier method to deal with the Wind Edge Lord!

When the Wind Edge Lord saw this scene, his pupils flashed with contempt, and he sneered, “I thought you’re strong and would choose to fight to the death. But even if you offer your sword to me and beg for mercy, I won’t let you off!”

When he saw Lin Yun putting away the Flower Burial Sword, he thought Lin Yun was about to beg for mercy. He slowly walked towards Lin Yun, and the Myriad Scales Armor radiated brightly. The runes on the scales were also activated, creating a melodious sound like wind chimes, and the dragon aura he gave off grew increasingly more powerful.

As majestic spiritual energy poured into his body, he was like a true dragon, and every movement could make the world tremble. Just the aura he gave off alone was terrifying. No one could imagine how powerful his attack would be when he unleashed it.

Just from the aura radiating from his attack, even someone at the fourth stage Profound Life Stage would be killed under this attack. When he got close to a hundred meters around Lin Yun, the massive pressure came crashing down and left fine cracks on Lin Yun’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

Seeing that Lin Yun’s sword intent was about to collapse, the Wind Edge Lord stopped, and smiled, “I’m curious. What treasure did you use to seal Liu Cheng? If you’re willing to offer it to me, I can consider changing my mind.”

“You’re dreaming.” Lin Yun smiled.

“It doesn’t matter. I’ll just have to help myself.” The Wind Edge Lord contemptuously said, before stomping on the water. When an explosion occurred on the sea, cracks that were tens of miles long began to spread out. The power he gave off was terrifying, and it felt as though he was stepping on the entire world beneath him.

“Kneel!” When the Wind Edge Lord landed, he gave Lin Yun a palm.

As silver light surged from his palm, it made his palm look like a massive dragon claw descending from the sky.

But something unbelievable happened. He was sent flying away when he got close to Lin Yun. Even the constellation behind him shattered, and his dragon aura began to collapse.

The Wind Edge Lord threw out a mouthful of blood and was sent ten miles away. When he landed, his pupils were filled with disbelief because he couldn’t believe that this was real.

Lin Yun slowly walked over under the splashes. When the Wind Edge Lord raised his head, he saw Lin Yun wielding an umbrella that he couldn’t recognize. This naturally made the Wind Edge Lord furious, and he slammed his palm on the surface of the sea. He roared, “You’re courting death!”

As a golden radiance shone from him, the powerful dragon aura began to gather from the surroundings.

“Oh, Azure Dragon, help me!” Lin Yun raised the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and began to pour his dragon runes into the umbrella. The umbrella was completely opened.

Beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven, the Azure Dragon Constellation opened their eyes. A gaze of eternity crossed through the great distance and fell onto the Wind Edge Lord.

The Wind Edge Lord reacted as though a huge palm slammed against him, and the dazzling silver light he gave off extinguished like a firefly. When he raised his head to look at the umbrella in Lin Yun’s hand, his pupils were filled with disbelief. He couldn’t believe what he saw.

Everyone in the world knew that the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella was in the hands of Lin Yun. throwing out a mouthful of blood. The Wind Edge Lord could feel his scalp going numb, and he couldn’t believe what he was seeing. He yelled, “You’re really Flower Burial?!”

Although he did spread rumors that Lin Xiao was Lin Yun, he never believed it himself, even when Zhuge Qingyun told him that there was a slight chance that Lin Xiao might be Lin Yun. He even wanted to ridicule Zhuge Qingyun for it.

After all, when the Heavenly Origin Mirror, Dragon Pulse Ranking’s dragon spirit, Azure Dragon Sword Art, Nirvana Banquet’s champion, and the Saint Tune labels were placed on Lin Xiao, no one would believe that he was Lin Yun.

But the reality was placed before his eyes, and he had no choice but to believe it.

“Are you surprised?” Lin Yun held onto the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and coldly looked at the Wind Edge Lord.

“Lin Xiao… No, Flower Burial, please listen to me…” The Wind Edge Lord’s heart was enveloped in fear, and he began to beg for mercy.

As Lin Yun fell from the sky, he simply thrust the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella like a spear at the Wind Edge Lord’s chest.

There were no cracks on the Myriad Scales Armor, but the Wind Edge Lord’s internal organs suffered a great blow as a majestic force penetrated into his body. This made the Wind Edge Lord spit out blood and his face distorted with pain.

“What a good treasure.” Lin Yun commented. As he spoke, he slammed the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella against the Wind Edge Lord.

The Myriad Scales Armor was powerful. Even without covering the head and legs, the saint runes would protect every inch of the wearer’s body.

But Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella was a genuine Sovereign Saint Artifact, not to mention that it had fused with a dragon soul not too long ago. So the power of this umbrella naturally far surpassed what the Wind Edge Lord could imagine.

As the umbrella continued to fall on him, there was no damage to the Myriad Scales Armor, but the Wind Edge Lord’s body was gradually crumbling. Each blow would make the Wind Edge Lord let out a miserable cry, and he could only try and dodge the incoming attacks by crawling.

“Lin Xiao, please spare my life. I can give you this armor, so please stop.” The Wind Edge Lord begged for mercy.

When Lin Yun finally stopped, sword intent exploded from him before the Wind Edge Lord could catch his breath. Empowered by the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, Lin Yun thrust forth with the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and shattered the Wind Edge Lord’s heart.

Even in his death, the Wind Edge Lord couldn’t figure it out. Lin Yun had risked exposing himself using the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, wanting to kill him. So how could he be spared? When he spread the rumors about Lin Xiao being Lin Yun, he had already thoroughly offended Lin Yun. Even if he didn’t come to the Black Tortoise Void Sea, Lin Yun would find ways to take his life.
