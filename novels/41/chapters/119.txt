Chapter 120 - Luck

“Brother Lin!” Zhang Yue's face was in disbelief as if he’d seen a ghost. He clearly remembered how Lin Yun jumped into the crater, so there should be nothing left of him by now.

“It’s me, Big Brother Zhang.” Lin Yun smiled.

“But I…” Zhang Yue blanked.

“You saw me jumping into the lava crater? I have a treasure that can ensure my safety in the lava and I waited for an eruption to plan my escape.” Lin Yun roughly explained his strategy. However, he did not mention anything about the sword box and Violet Sacred Frostfire.

“This…” Zhang Yue did not know what to say. He was still feeling shocked. But after sometime later, he smiled, “I really thought you were dead. I never imagined that you were still alive! Hahaha! You should’ve seen that old man’s face. He was practically on the verge of vomiting blood and he even jumped into the crater three times!”

Something like that happened? But Lin Yun wasn’t too surprised. The old man could naturally enter the lava with his cultivation. However, there was no way the old man could find him in shallow lava.

“Let’s not talk about that anymore. Where are you going, Big Brother Zhang?” Lin Yun asked.

“How can you stand out if you don’t fight while everyone does? That was what you previously told me. So I’ve decided to visit the Azure Sun Realm.” Zhang Yue scratched his head.

The Azure Sun County should be more than a month from now… In the blink of an eye, he had been in the Azure Sun County for months.

“Yeah, it won’t be far away. So I intend to widen my horizon inside. Brother Lin, do you want to go with me?” Zhang Yue felt that Lin Yun must’ve refined the Eighth Grade Lava Core. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to kill the Flametailed Wolf with one strike. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

So at least Zhang Yue felt safe to travel with Lin Yun.

With a difficult expression, Lin Yun replied, “I’m facing some trouble right now, and I’m afraid that I can’t travel with you. But I’m sure we will meet again in the Azure Sun County.”

“Now that you talked about it, the Blood Cloud Sect came after you jumped into the crater.” Zhang Yue spoke out.

“The Blood Cloud Sect?”

“Yeah, they were all in the fifth orifice of the Xiantian Realm. They were asking about you with your portrait. Back then, everyone was shocked by it. No one had imagined that you would have a Blood Bounty on your head. But we still told them truthfully, and they might think that you’re dead.”

Listening to Zhang Yue’s word’s, Lin Yun sneered. He never expected that the Blood Cloud Sect was so pesky to the point of searching the Heavenly Flame Peak. It looked like he’d underestimated them.

“Thank you for sharing this with me, Big Brother Zhang. If there’s nothing else, then I’ll take my leave first.”

“It’s no big deal.”

Swish!

Lin Yun soared into the sky and disappeared from Zhang Yue’s sights.

Looking at Lin Yun’s silhouette, Zhang Yue wore a faint smile. He was happy that Lin Yun was still alive. Back then, when he was under the impression that Lin Yun had died, he was depressed for some time.

The Eighth Grade Lava Core, is really powerful. It looks like Brother Lin’s strength has become more unfathomable. Zhang Yue was inwardly shocked when he saw the Flametailed Wolf’s corpse lying on the ground.

It was true that Lin Yun had grown stronger, but it had nothing to do with the Eighth Grade Lava Core. Instead, it was because of a Dragoncloud Fruit that he came across by pure luck.

In a mountain located at the massive mountain ranges, Lin Yun did not leave the mountains after his chat with Zhang Yue.

“It’s good that the Blood Cloud Sect is under the impression that I’m dead. I’ll make use of this time to refine the Eighth Grade Lava Core and give them a surprise!”

Lin Yun wanted to refine the Lava Core to evolve the Fiery Demon Physique into the Fiery Demon Battle Physique after coming out of the crater. But he had accidentally bumped into Mei Zihua, which caused him to consume the Dragoncloud Fruit that Mei Zihua was targeting.

As a result, he was forced to refine the Dragoncloud Fruit, which gave him another opportunity.

“Tough and soft combined is really powerful.” Lin Yun’s eyes glowed with excitement. He was not able to defeat the Flametailed Wolf with one punch in the past. However, when he punched the Flametailed Wolf earlier, the soft energy had formed into an endless cycle in its body that destroyed the internal organs.

“Speaking of which, why has the Sky Hibernation Mountains been so quiet the past few days? Mei Zihua did not notify his sect?”

Logically speaking, Mei Zihua should’ve contacted his sect to capture him.

“Forget it. It’ll save me the trouble since he’s not here.” Lin Yun gave up pondering since he couldn’t figure out Mei Zihua’s thoughts. With a grave expression, he took out the Eighth Grade Lava Core.

Compared to the Eighth Grade Lava Core, the Dragoncloud Fruit was insignificant. The Eighth Grade Lava Core only appeared after eight hundred years, and it was beneficial to cultivators who practiced fire elements.

For Lin Yun, it was an essential item to evolve his Fiery Demon Physique.

“I nearly died to that old man to obtain you. Please don’t disappoint me.” Lin Yun looked at the flames in his palm with excitement. Sitting down with his legs crossed, he clasped the Lava Core in his palms.

Boom!

When Lin Yun circulated his cultivation technique, the boundless spiritual energy contained in the Lava Core gushed into his body like a tidal wave. When the tidal wave swept through his internal organs and eight meridian channels, it made him feel tremendous pressure.

In the next second, Lin Yun could feel his internal organs being squashed. Shortly after, the boiling heatwave wreaked havoc within his body, shuttling around so violently that it nearly made Lin Yun vomit blood.

“How powerful!” The horror of the Eighth Grade Lava Core was beyond his expectation. As Lin Yun panicked, he immediately circulated the Thunderblitz Battle Physique’s technique in his body. He allowed the energy to temper his body.

Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!

When Lin Yun circulated the Thunderblitz Battle Physique, his bones started to crack. At the same time, a terrifying aura emitted from his body and it accumulated on the mountain.

The Fiery Demon’s aura was slowly settling down in his body.

Under the Thunderblitz Battle Physique, the pressure to his internal organs were alleviated a little. Meanwhile, the Eighth Grade Lava Core’s energy coursed through his body. Everything finally calmed down for him.

Lin Yun was relieved at this development. He was fortunate to have his physique tempered by fire in the past, otherwise he would be dead by now. But he knew this was just the beginning and he couldn’t afford to be careless.

Refining the Fiery Demon Battle Physique was a long process that he needed to be patient for.

As time ticked, Lin Yun slowly absorbed the Eighth Grade Lava Core. His cultivation slowly rose and approached the fourth orifice of the Xiantian Realm. At the same time, his Xiantian Pure Yang Art was making improvements thanks to the Lava Core.

In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed. In the past fifteen days, Lin Yun had absorbed most of the Eighth Grade Lava Core, leaving the last essence behind.

His body was like a sculptured scarlet jade that emitted a warm crimson glow.

“I succeeded!” Lin Yun’s body burst with crimson radiance when he absorbed the last essence. The ancient Fiery Demon Seal in his body was also starting to change.

When it had finished transforming, it would mean that he had achieved the Fiery Demon Battle Physique.

But suddenly, the thunder elemental spiritual energy in the surrounding started to stir. Black patches of clouds began to gather above him. Lin Yun felt like he was targeted by a majestic force of nature.

He opened his eyes anxiously and looked at the thunderclouds gathering above his heads. In the next second, Lin Yun’s face changed, “Lightning tribulation?!”

Damn it! Why is this happening?!

The Thunderblitz Battle Physique stated that only the Perfect Fiery Demon Battle Physique would cause a lightning tribulation. The manual said that heaven and earth would reject the existence of the Perfect Fiery Demon Battle Physique in the world and a lightning tribulation would descend. So if he could get through the lightning tribulation, he would have the Perfect Fiery Demon Battle Physique.

However, this scene left Lin Yun baffled, “But I’m only refining the Eighth Grade Lava Core, so it makes no sense for the lightning tribulation to descend!”

Lin Yun had no idea that it was because he had refined a Dragoncloud Fruit and an Eighth Grade Lava Core. The Dragoncloud Fruit had nourished his physique once, and when he refined the Eighth Grade Lava Core next, it was equivalent to refining a Perfect Lava Core.

He could sense the mighty power of heaven and earth. The lightning tribulation had caught him unprepared.

“Damn it! It’s coming!” Lin Yun raised his head to look at the thunderclouds. The lightning flickered and shuttled through the clouds and felt suffocating. Before he could even react, the first wave of the tribulation descended.

Struck by the bolt, a mouthful of blood gushed up Lin Yun’s throat and exited his mouth. He instantly suffered serious injuries, nearly causing him to faint.

Boom!

Another bolt of lightning descended, drawing yet another mouthful of blood from him. The horrifying lightning tribulation seemed like a sharp blade being wielded by heaven and earth.

While the lightning tribulation heavily injured him, the lighting also refined his body. But if he couldn’t endure the lightning tribulation, then it would take his life.

Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!

A total of nine bolts of lightning descended, one stronger than the other. When all the bolts descended, the mountain had vanished.

Since Lin Yun wasn’t prepared for this, he could only power his way through with his physique. In the end, he was lying in a pile of rubble and his current status was unknown.

When the tribulation clouds dissipated, the rubble exploded. A fragile figure crawled out from the rubble with great difficulty. As Lin Yun laid on the rocks, he smiled bitterly, “Is this the fortune after surviving a great disaster?”

But in the next second, the smile disappeared on Lin Yun’s face when he saw a pack of hyenas coming in his direction.

Those hyenas were demonic beasts, but their cultivation was only in the second orifice of the Xiantian Realm. They would usually flee at the sight of Lin Yun, but now they acted boldly and approached Lin Yun.

Greed could be seen in their eyes. They had treated Lin Yun as their prey.

Lin Yun wanted to pick up a stone to chase them away, but he helplessly discovered that he couldn’t even move his fingers at the moment.

You would be blessed by heaven and earth if luck came. But if luck wasn’t on your side, even a hero would fall.

He dared to snatch the Eighth Grade Lava Core from a seventh orifice cultivator and he even dared to look down on Mei Zihua. It wasn’t easy for him to get through the lightning tribulation, but he was actually done in by a couple of hyenas?

Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!

Just when the hyenas were about to approach Lin Yun, a fiery shadow bolted over.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The Dragon Blooded Horse raised its hooves, trampling a hyena to death. After three stomps, the remaining hyenas fled for their lives.
