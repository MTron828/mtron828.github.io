Chapter 920 - Confrontation!

Shi Feng’s gaze emphasized his warning as he unleashed his killing intent.

“Warn me? Do you think I care about what you say when you’re not even in the Azure Dragon Ranking?” Since Shi Feng had revealed his killing intent, Lin Yun didn’t bother acting polite. Plus, this wasn’t the first time Shi Feng had threatened him.

Shi Feng’s gaze flashed coldly with his face becoming nasty. Before coming to the Glorysun Land, he didn’t even bother placing someone from the lower realm like Lin Yun in his eyes. But after Lin Yun killed Feng Wuji, he became so arrogant that didn’t even place him in his eyes.

“I don’t wish to waste time with you. Get lost now while you still can!” Shi Feng said while circulating both his aura oceans. He might seem to be threatening Lin Yun, but he was secretly accumulating his killing intent preparing to deal a fatal blow to Lin Yun.

“Interesting. Do you think I’m afraid of you? Who the hell do you think you are?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with mockery as he landed on the ancient altar and reached out to the Glorysun Spirit.

When Shi Feng heard this, he instantly unleashed his killing intent. But Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with Shi Feng because his attention was on the Glorysun Spirit. The Glorysun Spirit was enveloped in flames, which meant that the flames had to be destroyed first.

In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun’s hand pierced the flame membrane by relying on his sword intent. The true appearance of the Glorysun Spirit was finally revealed. It was a fist-sized black piece of metal with golden runes that lit up the entire hall.

The golden runes were shining brightly with a powerful aura that sealed off the true nature of the black metal. Like everyone had said, it was sealed. Lin Yun instantly recognized the golden runes that wrapped the Glorysun Spirit like chains. Unfortunately, a Heavenly Soul Realm expert couldn’t break the seal.

“Put the Glorysun Spirit down!” Since Lin Yun ignored Shi Feng’s warning, he couldn’t help feeling rage. Losing control of his feelings, Shi Feng charged towards the altar to attack Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was focused on breaking the flame membrane around the Glorysun Spirit and merely glanced at Shi Feng. Shi Feng might have been a formidable enemy in the past, but Lin Yun had no reason to fear him.

Even if he had to split his attention to retrieve the Glorysun Spirit, he wasn’t concerned with Shi Feng. After all, Shi Feng’s strength was comparable to Chen An.

“You’re courting death!” Shi Feng reached out with his fingers and shot a dazzling purple sword ray at Lin Yun’s chest.

Lin Yun sneered when he saw this. Shi Feng was truly naive if he thought he could stop Lin Yun with such a low level sword aura.

Flicking his finger, Lin Yun unleashed an even more domineering sword aura at Shi Feng. When the sword rays clashed, Shi Feng’s purple sword ray instantly crumbled.

“Spiritual sword intent again?!” Shi Feng cursed as he stared at Lin Yun. Although Lin Yun’s cultivation was weak, he was still able to restrict Shi Feng. Obviously, it made Shi Feng feel terrible.

Shi Feng stopped wasting his time and drew his sword. The pressure of a dao artifact started gushing as he cut the altar in two.

But Lin Yun was eyeing Shi Feng’s dao artifact from the beginning. Before Shi Feng even drew his sword, Lin Yun had retreated with the Cloud Soaring Art. While retreating, he peeled off the flame membrane that enveloped the Glorysun Spirit, causing the entire hall to tremble violently.

Shi Feng was shocked because he never expected Lin Yun to be so fast. It looked like the pressure of his dao artifact wasn’t able to restrict Lin Yun.

Since Lin Yun was peeling off the flames that covered the Glorysun Spirit, Shi Feng knew he was almost out of time. If Shi Feng couldn’t stop him, Lin Yun would successfully take the Glorysun Spirit. It was a level of humiliation that Shi Feng couldn’t live with.

“Die!” Circulating both of his aura oceans at the same time, Shi Feng started pouring his origin energy into his sword.

“Interesting…” After fighting with Chen An, Lin Yun was no longer a stranger to the power of a dao artifact. He started pouring his sword intent into his eyes to find the flaws in Shi Feng’s attacks.

“Thunderbolt Slash! Solar Slash! Breaking Dawn! Tai’a Slash! Blood Suppression!” Lin Yun used one hand with the Overlord sword and the other hand to peel the seal off of the Glorysun Spirit. Normally, the Overlord Sword couldn’t compete with a dao artifact, but it could when empowered by spiritual sword intent.

Layers of sword rays overlapped together and negated most of Shi Feng’s power.

“Supreme Dominance!” Relying on his advantage in sword attainment, Lin Yun caught his opponent by surprise.

The domineering sword not only pierced through Shi Feng’s aura, but even left a wound on his chest. Fortunately for Shi Feng, Lin Yun didn’t use his sword. Otherwise, the injuries would have been serious. However, the fact that it could penetrate through the aura of his dao artifact alone was terrifying.

“Flower Burial, you really do deserve your name.” A voice sounded out from a tunnel as Mo Han walked forward with his halberd. By his composure, it was evident that he had been watching in the dark for quite a while.

Shi Feng instantly saw through Mo Han’s plan. He must have been waiting for Lin Yun and Shi Feng to exhaust themselves before making an entrance. Clearly, Mo Han didn’t expect Lin Yun to be so strong. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have come out so early.

A terrifying thought appeared in Shi Feng’s mind as he looked around. If Mo Han is here, where is Chen An?

“Where’s Chen An?” Shi Feng looked at Lin Yun as he started trembling when he thought about what might have happened.

“He might be dead somewhere. Who knows?” replied Lin Yun indifferently. After all, Chen An’s life and death meant nothing to him the moment he swung his sword.

“You!” Shi Feng’s face sank when he heard that. Lin Yun basically admitted to killing Chen An. When Mo Han heard that, his smile also disappeared.

“Shi Feng, it looks like we have to work together…” Mo Han’s expression became grave as he gripped his halberd tightly. Lin Yun was an existence completely out of his calculations. Who would have thought that the higher realm geniuses wouldn’t stand a chance against Lin Yun.

Feng Wuji died and no one knew what happened to Chen An. At the very least, Chen An was no longer inside the barrier. Otherwise, he would be competing for the Glorysun Spirit. Shi Feng and Mo Han had no other choice but to join hands.

“How are we going to split the Glorysun Spirit?” asked Shi Feng.

With a grave expression, Mo Han replied, “Does it really matter? It will be humiliating if we let this brat from the lower realms take it!”

The moment Shi Feng and Mo Han formed an alliance, the flame membrane enveloping the Glorysun Spirit finally dissipated. The golden runes lit up the entire hall, but the Glorysun Spirit was still tightly sealed.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Under the golden brilliance, the entire hall began to tremble violently and a destructive power quickly spread out. In the blink of an eye, cracks started to appear on the barrier.

With the hall shaking violently, Shi Feng and Mo Han could sense that the barrier was about to collapse. When they looked at the Glorysun Spirit in Lin Yun’s hand, they couldn’t help feeling rage. Lin Yun really took it!

“You two are dead!” Now that he had obtained the Glorysun Spirit, Lin Yun no longer had to divide his attention. He could focus on fighting Shi Feng and Mo Han.

Since they were so shameless to gang up on him, Lin Yun didn’t mind being a little ruthless!

Killing intent flashed on Lin Yun’s face as he prepared to dye the sky in blood.
