Chapter 1886 - Unprecedented

When the conferring ceremony began, over two hundred people from the two palaces, three courtyards, and one hundred and eight peaks would become saint disciples. The numbers were close to three hundred, meaning the saint disciples weren’t valuable within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and only saint’s disciples would have some position within the sect. After figuring that out, Lin Yun lost interest in the conferring ceremony and hoped it would end quickly.

On the high altar, a group of people descended from the sky with a white-bearded saint elder taking the lead. Those around him were all at the Quasi-Saint Realm. The Indigo Thunder Peak’s Peak Master was amongst those people, and he even wore a new robe today.

He was at the pinnacle of the Quasi-Saint Realm and was stronger than other Quasi-Saints. He had always been in seclusion, trying to reach the Saint Realm, and he wouldn’t have attended if it was in the past. But he had a smile was plastered on his face today because there was finally a saint disciple coming from the Indigo Thunder Peak.

He instantly noticed Ye Qingtian within the crowd and stroked his beard with a smile.

“We greet Saint Elder!” Everyone bowed.

After everyone greeted the white-bearded Saint Elder, the old man said, “The Heavenly Dao Sect has a long history, and our ancestor relied on two swords to cut down all the obstacles for humanity and contributed significantly to the Divine Dragon Era’s stability. The Heavenly Dao Sect has the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword, and the wielders of those swords would come to this altar before their deaths and turn into flames to strengthen our Heavenly Dao Sect, enabling our Sacred Flame to burn for eternity. After the conferring ceremony, all of you will be able to comprehend the Sacred Flame once, which is a rare opportunity. So you guys have to cherish it well.”

The conferring ceremony was formal. After Saint Elder was done reciting, Saint Elder smiled as the conferring ceremony was finally about to begin.

“The conferring ceremony today will be a little different, and this is also the first time I’ve met something like this…” Saint Elder briefly paused before he roared, “Ye Qingtian, where are you?!”

His gaze was like two sharp swords directed at Lin Yun. If it were in the past, Lin Yun’s Divine Tortoise Transformation would have been instantly broken.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Cupping his hands, Lin Yun said, “Saint Elder, I’m here.”

“Since last night, many disciples from the various peaks came to me, wanting me to remove your qualification to become a saint disciple. Even the elders and people from the two palaces and three courtyards came, listing your crimes. There are over three hundred of them, not to mention you were expelled from the sect a year ago.” His voice instantly caused an uproar because no one expected the saint elder to openly say this.

But the saint disciples waiting to be conferred were briefly stunned before they revealed mocking expressions and even sneered. After all, no one had been treated in this manner before during the conferring ceremony, and this was equivalent to a colossal shame.

Their gazes then fell onto Lin Yun, gloating at his misery. At this moment, the uniform belonging to a saint disciple he wore became a laughingstock.

But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by that and merely sneered, dropping the manners he had for Saint Elder earlier.

“Saint Elder, you can’t do that. No matter what, Ye Qingtian’s cultivation is at the Profound Death Stage, and he has already been punished for his crimes. How can you mention it again?” The Indigo Thunder Peak’s Peak Master spoke out.

“Why did I hear that his cultivation came from the seniors of his clan and a saint origin?” A black-robed old man spoke out with a smile.

“Wind Origin Quasi-Saint, what do you mean by that?!” The Indigo Thunder Peak’s Peak Master looked over with a dark expression.

“Nothing much. I’m only worried that the Ye Clan’s seniors brought more harm than good to him. After all, it’ll be disastrous if this matter affects the prestige of our Heavenly Dao Sect!” the Wind Origin Quasi-Saint said.

“Bullshit!” The Indigo Thunder Peak’s Peak Master roared. He long had grudges with the Wind Origin Quasi-Saint, and he knew that the latter was trying to cause problems for him on purpose.

But Saint Elder soon stopped their conflict and looked at Lin Yun, “Ye Qingtian, what do you have to say?”

“Nothing. A lot of people hate me, but they’re nothing. I won’t accept it if they want me to leave the Chess Daofield. But I have nothing to say if you want me to leave, just know that you better not regret it when I become a saint in the future,” Lin Yun said.

His words instantly caused an uproar as everyone looked at Lin Yun in disbelief, wondering if he had gone insane to speak to Saint Elder in this manner.

“How arrogant!”

“Where are the Law-Enforcing Elders! Drag him down!”

“Ye Qingtian, where did you get the guts to be rude to Saint Elder!”

All the Quasi-Saints around Saint Elder roared after hearing what Lin Yun said. But Saint Elder stopped them with a wave of his hand and asked with a smile, “Ye Qingtian, do explain to me what you mean by telling me not to regret it in the future!”

Saint Elder might be wearing a smile on his face, but he gave off an intense pressure.

Facing the pressure he gave off, Lin Yun didn’t cower, but smiled, “A bunch of garbage who only knows how to talk behind one’s back. How can I accept it? But I naturally have nothing to say if you want me to leave because you’re stronger than me. But when I become a Saint, I’ll give you a beating until you are convinced!”

When Lin Yun said those words, everyone’s faces turned pale. Even the lips of the Indigo Thunder Peak’s Peak Master twitched, and wondered if Ye Qingtian forgot to take his medicine today. He wants to beat up a Saint Elder?

Everyone in the surroundings were also looking at Lin Yun with shock on their faces. There was no lack of geniuses within the Heavenly Dao Sect, but it was unprecedented for someone to tell a Saint that he would beat him up. Regardless of Lin Yun’s strength, no one could match his arrogance, at the very least.

The disciples of the Profound Maiden Courtyard sneaked peeks at Lin Yun with their eyes shining brightly. Even Bai Shuying locked her brows together, wondering if Ye Qingtian was courting death.

On the other hand, Ye Xinyan dazed while looking at Ye Qingtian because she found this figure to be resembling someone she knew.

But surprisingly, the smile on the Saint Elder’s face became even denser, “I don’t want to be beaten up. So I naturally won’t ask you to leave.”

As he spoke, his face suddenly sank, and he roared, “Did you guys hear what he said? Where are those that reported him? I don’t want to be beaten up in the future, and it depends on you guys if you can convince him to leave!”

When Saint Elder became furious, thunderclouds covered the sky as though the sky would collapse the next moment. This naturally scared everyone.

Luo Cheng jumped up. He had been waiting for this moment for a long time. But this made Bai Shuying furrow her brows. This Luo Cheng might be a disciple of the Nether Orchid Courtyard, but she didn’t like looking at this person now.

“Ye Qingtian, you didn’t dare to fight me earlier, and yet you dare to be so unruly to Saint Elder? It looks like I’ll have to teach you a lesson today!” Luo Cheng drew his sword and disappeared on the spot, leaving behind flower petals.

“The Nether Orchid Shadow!” Everyone’s eyes lit up, instantly recognizing the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s secret technique. Learning this technique wasn’t easy. But if anyone managed to learn it, their movements would become like shadows.

“It looks like Luo Cheng was careless back then.”

“Based on this movement technique alone, how can he lose to Ye Qingtian?”

When Luo Cheng reappeared, he was already standing before Lin Yun. His pupils flashed with a cold light and murderous intent. He didn’t want to drag the battle on, so he wanted to end this quickly. But just when his sword was about to come in contact with Lin Yun, the smile on his face disappeared because Lin Yun was nowhere to be found.

When Luo Cheng felt uneasy, a sword vibration echoed from the sky with a dazzling sword ray spreading out. In the next moment, a powerful sword aura enveloped him. When Lin Yun reappeared, he was still standing in his original position and hadn’t moved a step.

But the sword aura he gave off was like a massive mountain. Luo Cheng was merely standing at the foot of the mountain, so he naturally couldn’t see Lin Yun.

Lin Yun merely raised his hand, then swung it down. Luo Cheng’s sword aura began to collapse before he threw out a mouthful of blood. Luo Cheng’s face became pale, and his sword slipped out of his hand as he took several steps back.

“Come back!” Lin Yun smiled, and reached out to grab Luo Cheng. His grasp unleashed a powerful suction force, and Luo Cheng was horrified to discover that he couldn’t break free from the suction force, no matter how he struggled.

Ye Qingtian’s cultivation was lower than his, but his profound death aura had far surpassed him. But how was this possible?

While Luo Cheng was in disbelief, Lin Yun kicked him and sent him flying away like a cannonball, before rolling on the ground.

As the surroundings fell silent, Lin Yun raised his brow and smiled, “I know a lot of people hate me, but those at the third channel of the Profound Death Stage don’t even bother standing out. I’m afraid that you guys will only embarrass yourselves.”

Those initially eager to stand out suddenly died down, but their gazes glared at Lin Yun. Half of the people here weren’t even at the third channel of the Profound Death Stage, and Lin Yun’s words had targeted almost everyone present. But no one dared to say a word because Luo Cheng lost too quickly, and even the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples felt ashamed of him.

As for all the Quasi-Saints present on the altar, they had disbelief on their faces, especially the Wind Origin Quasi-Saint. Lin Yun’s performance was a resounding slap to his face. It appeared that Lin Yun’s cultivation didn’t seem to be forcibly boosted.

The Indigo Thunder Peak’s Peak Master smiled when he saw this scene, “That brat looks like me from the past. He’s arrogant enough!”

All the Quasi-Saints became speechless when they heard that. The Indigo Thunder Peak’s Peak Master was really shameless to say that.
