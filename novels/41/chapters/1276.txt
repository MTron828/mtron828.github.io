Chapter 1277 - Gathering of Geniuses (2)

“He’s not a disciple of the Skysolute Sect, nor is he from the Sword Emperor’s lineage. He just claims to have the dignity of the Sword Emperor.” Lin Yun helped Gongsun Yan out of his current circumstance. After all, it was true that Gongsun Yan wasn’t from the Sword Emperor’s lineage, nor was he a disciple of the Skysolute City.

Lin Yun’s explanation made Gongsun Yan let out a breath of relief, but it still made him feel terrible. After all, he wasn’t him boasting, his heart to chase after the sword was firm and unwavering. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“I can tell. If he’s really from the Sword Emperor’s lineage, he wouldn’t look so terrified.” Feng Jue said with a complicated expression before he continued, “Nor will I kill a disciple of the Skysolute City. Who in the world dares to compete with the Sword Emperor in the current era?”

“That’s for sure.” Gongsun Yan said with pride. “The nine emperors were invincible when they appeared three thousand years ago, each occupying a territory in Kunlun Realm. They were practically legends, but their names are still resounding. Only Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng had made the most recent appearance, and swordsmen like me naturally wish to follow in his footsteps.”

“Haha.” Feng Jue sneered.

This instantly made Gongsun Yan feel awkward, so he smiled. “I’m just casually talking about it. I’m really not from the Sword Emperor’s lineage, so please don’t misunderstand.”

“Do you think you’re fit with how cowardly you look right now?” Feng Jue retorted.

Hearing those words made Gongsun Yan’s face turn red, but he didn’t dare to utter a single word. Right at that moment, a golden beam soared into the sky from another island.

“Saint elixir!” Zhao Yan exclaimed.

This time, it was a genuine saint elixir and wasn’t something created with the Nine Dragon Devouring Array. This also meant that the powerful sects of the Ancient Barren Domain would definitely fight over it.

“That seems to be the island belonging to the Sword Sect…” Lin Yun said.

“I’ll take my leave first. Anyhow, you’re really lucky to obtain a saint elixir, since it’s not easy for the powerful sects to obtain a saint elixir like you.” Feng Jue looked at Lin Yun enviously before he soared into the sky and left. The saint elixir had appeared on the island belonging to the Sword Sect. So even if he disliked the Scarlet Firmament Peak, he had to help out as a Samsara Edict Realm expert from a sibling sect.

“The disciple of the Radiant Sword Sect really has quite the temper…” Gongsun Yan muttered. He was so terrified that both of his feet went soft earlier. After all, Feng Jue merely unleashed half an inch of his sword ray and that took the lives of eight Dragon Pulse Realm experts.

Lin Yun didn’t bother about Gongsun Yan. His gaze was on the distant light. There was a multitude of geniuses gathered over there, and each of them was glowing brightly due to the energies released by them. Even with just a simple glance, Lin Yun could sense the powerful auras that they were giving off.

Compared to the competition over a quasi-saint elixir, the competition over there was a lot more intense. Lin Yun’s gaze soon fixed on a white-clothed youth. That youth carried a sword box on his back and emitted a dazzling golden radiance from his body.

At the same time, Lin Yun recognized a familiar figure standing beside that white-clothed youth. It was Mu Qingqing, who had briefly stayed in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“That’s Sikong Zhou, the strongest Empyrean from the Sword Sect who possesses the rare Saint Dragon Sword Physique. It’s rumored that he has cultivated the Great Flow Sword Art to the seventh stage. Furthermore, he’s also ranked fourth on the Empyrean Ranking!” Gongsun Yan said when he followed Lin Yun’s gaze.

“He’s Sikong Zhou?” Lin Yun raised his brow with fighting spirit flashing through his pupils.

“He’s very strong. After all, it’s not easy to reach and maintain the fourth position on the rankings…” Gongsun Yan said with a grave expression.

“Those dressed in golden clothes are disciples of the Profound Valley. They’re proficient in the path of spiritual runes, and I heard that the strongest Empyrean among the younger generation was a sixth-grade saint spiritualist, grasping a total of six complete saint runes. He’s capable of creating a saint spiritual diagram in a single breath, making him a tough opponent.”

When Lin Yun followed Gongsun Yan’s gaze, he saw a group of youths dressed in golden clothes. The one leading the party had an elegant temperament with his pupils shining brightly like stars that gave others a feeling as if he was one with the heavens.

A sixth-grade saint spiritualist? Lin Yun hadn’t been cultivating in the way of spiritual runes, but he also knew that fourth-grade spiritualists were comparable to the Heavenly Soul Realm and after that would be saint spiritualists.

Saint spiritualists were comparable to Empyreans, and the saint spiritualist has a total of nine grades. Above that would be heavenly spiritualists, and heavenly spiritualists were existences that were greatly respected, even by saints.

But as Lin Yun had never faced a saint spiritualist before, he had no idea how strong a sixth-grade saint spiritualist would be.

“That should be the Thunder Sect!” When Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto a group of people donned in purple clothes, he instantly recognized them. After all, that sect had once tried to recruit him back on the Heavenly Path. Every single one of them was enveloped in lightning and flames, emitting two different martial intents.

“Hehe, even the ladies from the Heavenly Note Sect are there.” Gongsun Yan suddenly smiled when he saw the arrival of a group of women. They were all wielding a musical instrument while flying over to where the saint elixir light came from. “No one can compete with them in terms of music in the Ancient Barren Domain, and the strongest amongst our generation should be Ye Qingmei.”

There was a woman dressed in white giving off an ethereal temperament, as though she was an immortal. She should be Ye Qingmei.

Those who were recognized by Gongsun Yan were monstrous geniuses from their respective sects, and they were naturally after the saint elixir. Behind them were Empyreans of some big sects who came for the saint elixir as well because they had no interest in quasi-saint elixirs.

For example, Dugu Yan, whom Lin Yun had heard about numerous times and who was known to be invincible in the sword, was also among the Empyreans over there. Aside from that, there were also many unknown powerful Empyreans whom Gongsun Yan couldn’t recognize.

He speculated that they must not be from the Ancient Barren Domain. After all, the Eastern Desolation was huge, and the Ancient Barren Domain merely occupied 30% of the territory in the Eastern Desolation. Many of those geniuses were like Lin Yun, who wasn’t on the Empyrean Ranking.

“The Profound Sky Sect is here…” Right at that moment, Zhao Yan suddenly spoke up.

“Where are they?” Lin Yun’s eyes coldly flashed as he wore a grave expression. After all, he had a feud with the Profound Sky Sect. He heard that the Nether Divinity Realm Son had an elder in the sect holding a high position, and it was also well-known that the Profound Sky Sect was an undisputed overlord in the Ancient Barren Domain!
