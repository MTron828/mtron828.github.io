Chapter 807 - Flower Burial Disagrees!

When Nangong Wanyu unleashed all his frost sword intent’s aura, the entire sky instantly turned dark. Judging from the aura, Nangong Wanyu was either at greater mastery or complete mastery.

Lin Yun had speculated about Nangong Wanyu’s strength in the past, but it was difficult to assess since he didn’t cultivate other martial intents. Now, he could tell that Nangong Wanyu was a lot stronger than Li Mubai.

Not giving Lin Yun a chance to catch his breath, Nangong Wanyu soared into the sky. The frost sword intent surrounded him like majestic clouds. Is he finally going to bring out his trump card?

“In the name of my sword, bloom!” Lin Yun’s face was calm as the origin energy in his violet palace began to circulate. WIth the Iris Flower at the center of his origin energy, he pushed the Iris Sword Sutra to the limit. Raising the Flower Burial in his hand, Lin Yun stabbed his sword out.

A boundless sword ray descended from the sky and clashed with Lin Yun’s sword. The stage underneath Lin Yun started to crack from the impact. At this moment, the stage’s spiritual array activated as dust flew into the air.

The barrier did its best to protect the crowd from the impact, but cracks started to spread all over it. This scene shocked many people as the array was extremely powerful. Although they expected Nangong Wanyu to be strong after his aura reached the Heavenly Soul Realm, they didn’t think it would be this strong.

Even more surprising was the fact that Lin Yun managed to withstand this attack with his sword intent at complete mastery. The Iris Flower that was behind Lin Yun intrigued the crowd as they wondered what cultivation technique he practiced.

After receiving Nangong Wanyu’s attack, Lin Yun was sent flying. When the cloud of dust cleared up, the crowd saw several wounds on his body that dyed his clothes red.

“It’s still too forceful for him to take Nangong Wanyu’s sword head-on. The gap between them is obvious.”

“Nangong Wanyu’s sword intent reached complete mastery a long time ago, not to mention that he fused it with his front intent.”

“His sword intent has a clear advantage due to the huge gap in their cultivation. Lin Yun would be in the ground right now if it wasn’t for his cultivation technique.”

“It really isn’t easy for people to face Nangong Wanyu.”

“In a battle between swordsmen, the suspense disappears after their sword intent is suppressed.”

Pavilion Master Plum and the party from the Great Qin Empire had concern in their eyes. After all, it wouldn’t be easy for a swordsman to turn the tables around if their sword intent was suppressed.

“Phew. And here I thought that this brat would really turn things around.” Yan Long’zi sighed with relief and smiled with disdain in his eyes. He was clearly shocked when Lin Yun defeated Li Mubai with a single sword. So when he saw this situation, he was full of contempt, “He does have some strength, but he must be dreaming to think that he can beat Nangong Wanyu.”

As soon as he finished talking, the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s disciples looked at him strangely. After all, Yan Long’zi embarrassed himself multiple times when talking about Lin Yun. Although everyone felt that Lin Yun would lose, Yan Long’zi’s words made them nervous. Lin Yun might turn the tables because of Yan Long’zi’s words.

When Yan Long’zi saw the strange looks, rage filled his heart, “What are you guys looking at? If that brat can turn the tables around, I’ll slap myself ten times!”

Those words instantly silenced the disciples.

From the center of the stage, Nangong Wanyu examined Lin Yun’s condition. After all, he just used his strongest attack and held nothing back. Not even a genuine Heavenly Soul Realm expert could take his attack head-on. “Your sword sutra seems to be stronger than the one from my Northern Snow Manor.”

Lin Yun met Nangong Wanyu’s attack head-on and only suffered light injuries.

“Your frost sword intent is truly formidable.” Lin Yun examined his injuries. This was the first time he suffered such heavy injuries in the banquet. It really wasn’t going to be an easy win.

The previous exchange revealed the huge difference in their strength. Lin Yun felt bad that he was getting suppressed since he wasn’t using his spiritual sword intent.

“But if this is all you got, you won’t see my true trump card. Sword intent doesn’t rely on the amount that you have, but how you use it.” Lin Yun was calm and collected when he looked at Nangong Wanyu’s ever growing aura.

“Is that so? Then please, guide me!” Nangong Wanyu’s eyes flashed coldly and his sword ray shot out. His sword aura caused a piercing sound while his sword grew brighter. It sounded like a massive army was galloping through a battlefield.

The sword ray exploded with a violent storm that caused cracks to appear on the Iris Flower behind Lin Yun. The geniuses who were still in the competition couldn’t help thinking that the situation was a little too one sided now.

Although Nangong Wanyu was the attacker, he began to feel annoyed. No matter how he attacked, Lin Yun resisted him. It was especially annoying when Lin Yun pushed his overlord sword to the limit. Nangong Wanyu had a huge advantage, but he couldn’t break through Lin Yun’s sword intent. He also didn’t want to take it too far as he would be full of openings.

If he was careless and Lin Yun found an opportunity, the Overlord Sword would descend onto him instantly. He didn’t have Lin Yun’s powerful physique, so he couldn’t imagine the consequences. As long as Lin Yun’s sword intent was around, it was possible that the tables could be turned around at any time.

“How annoying.” Nangong Wanyu finally lost his patience since he was struggling to take Lin Yun down. Snowflakes began to rain down from the sky as Nangong Wanyu’s sword aura manifested into a silver falcon. The falcon’s gaze was cold as its massive body nearly occupied one-third of the stage. When Nangong Wanyu swung his sword, the falcon dove with a loud cry.

“Damn it.” Nangong Wanyu’s attack astonished the group from the Great Qin Empire. Then, the falcon flapped its wings and silver light rained down on the lake.

“Great timing!” Lin Yun narrowed his eyes and the origin energy within his body fluctuated. The sword in his hand radiated with moonlight essence as a radiant moon hung high in the sky before dividing into nine crimson moons.

Overlord Sword—Blood Suppression!

This was the first time that Lin Yun ever used the fifth form of the Overlord Sword in front of others. The nine crimson moons blazed in the sky and shined their crimson moonlight everywhere. Then, the crimson moons soared into the sky and collided with the silver falcon, causing a huge explosion in the sky.

Under the huge impact, the already damaged stage was covered with deep craters. As origin energy fluctuated, a violent sword gale swept out.

This shocking scene made many people narrow their eyes because they were greatly shocked by Lin Yun and Nangong Wanyu’s fight. After all, the clash was too terrifying for people who hadn’t even reached the Heavenly Soul Realm. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

With another explosion on the stage, Lin Yun and Nangong Wanyu moved away from each other.

“I’m truly surprised. I never expected that it would be so difficult to deal with you. But I won’t let you win!” Nangong Wanyu wore a grave expression as his eyes flashed coldly.

“Flower Burial disagrees!” Lin Yun raised his brow and smiled. He had to admit that this was a satisfying battle. He was under great pressure without using spiritual sword intent. However, the pressure was satisfying and made his blood boil. As his fighting spirits blazed, the sword in his hand buzzed incessantly.
