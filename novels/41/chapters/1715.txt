Chapter 1716 – Huang Xuanyi

Huang Xuanyi was also at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, but anyone could tell that he was stronger than the blue-robed youth, judging from the aura he gave off. When he stood up and emitted a powerful aura, he instantly captivated everyone’s attention.

The Wind Edge Lord’s face was cold, and he said, “Brother Huang, I’ll have to trouble you to give Young Master Lin a welcome!”

He heavily emphasized ‘welcome,’ and his facial expression was cold, which suppressed the surrounding atmosphere. This was a sign that he was furious. He was one of the Four Young Masters in the Heavenly Domain City, possessed nobility in the Divine Dragon Empire, was a top-tiered Dragon Pulse Realm genius, and came from a prestigious clan.

It was rare for the Wind Edge Lord to be furious. But today, he was furious because what Lin Yun said earlier was too arrogant. Not only did Lin Yun just slap everyone here, but his face was also slapped.

“A mad dog like him should be taught a lesson. Wind Edge Lord, you’re too polite to him.” Haung Xuanyi leaped and descended before Lin Yun. He coldly asked, “Lin Xiao, how do you want to die?”

When he said those words, a terrifying killing intent exploded from him. From the killing intent he was giving off, everyone could see a terrifying illusion built from a mountain of corpses. It was a river formed with blood, and ghosts were crying, creating various phenomena that made everyone tremble.

This made everyone feel a chill run down their spines and felt that Huang Xuanyi truly deserved his past spot as first on the Elysium Core Ranking. His reputation was obtained through his strength, standing out from the crowd.

Anyone could see his objective as he tried to suppress Lin Yun with his aura, using his killing intent to defeat Lin Yun. If Lin Yun didn’t have a firm will, he would easily be crushed by the killing intent alone.

But it was a pity that it was used on the wrong person. As a swordsman, the people he slew were more than Huang Xuanyi, not to mention he even killed a Great Saint. Using this kind of tactic on him was only a futile effort.

With a casual smile, Lin Yun replied, “I was just curious. Weren’t you blinded by Flower Burial? Now I finally know what’s going on. So you transplanted a pair of dog’s eyes!”

“You bastard! You must be courting death!” Huang Xuanyi lost it when he heard what Lin Yun said.

This made everyone feel a chill run down their spines because the killing intent that Huang Xuanyi gave off became even more terrifying, with a dreadful chill sweeping out. When they looked at Lin Yun, their pupils were filled with pity because they knew this matter today wouldn’t be resolved so easily. After all, Lin Yun just jabbed Huang Xuanyi’s sore spot!

The news of Huang Xuanyi being blinded by Lin Yun had long spread out within the Eastern Desolation, causing a huge commotion that made everyone outside the Ancient Barren Domain hear about Flower Burial’s name. When Flower Burial’s name shocked the entire Kunlun Realm, the act of him blinding Huang Xuanyi was dug out by others. Huang Xuanyi came out from it with great difficulty, but Flower Burial had become a sore spot for him.

As Huang Xuanyi’s gaze turned cold, he dashed towards Lin Yun. When he was in mid-air, his ten fingers began to form seals and lightning condensed into a purple moon, while a bright sun flew out from him.

When the sun and moon appeared, the radiance lit up the surroundings. When he reached Lin Yun, the sun and moon combined into an ancient ‘Ming’ word. The surface of the ‘Ming’ word was covered in terrifying saint runes as it hovered in the air like a saint artifact, emitting an ancient aura.

Everyone instantly recognized this was the Light Destruction Divine Array of the Ming Cult. Not only could it restrict the cultivation and movements of the other party, but it could also be used as a means of attack like a myriad-rune saint artifact.

When Lin Yun clashed with him three times, he took three steps back. Under the pressure of the Divine Radiant Annihilation Art, Huang Xuanyi fully unleashed the power of his cultivation.

“Hmph!” But Huang Xuanyi didn’t let Lin Yun off so easily. With a cold bark, the killing intent that he gave off grew even more terrifying.

“Lightless Sun Moon!” Huang Xuanyi pushed his hands forth, and the ‘Ming’ formed by the sun and moon descended from the sky. When the ‘Ming’ word descended, the night sky and the light in the West Garden Banquet became even darker.

“Lin Xiao, die!” The ‘Ming’ word was like a sharp weapon charging towards Lin Yun.

The surrounding atmosphere became bizarre since the West Garden Banquet was held at night to begin with. But when the night became even darker, it was like an abyss that slowly devoured everyone’s vision.

“There must be light!” Lin Yun smiled and waved his hand just when he was about to be devoured by the darkness. The night was like a curtain being pulled apart as a dazzling golden radiance shone. Light returned to the world and became even more spectacular than before. One of the three Divine Sunchasing Art’s phenomena was Myriad Miles Divine Radiance.

“Break!” As Lin Yun’s energies surged, his dragon origin went rampant, and five dragon pulses appeared behind him. The dragon pulses were covered in a faint saint radiance, and Lin Yun’s aura began to rise when the dragon pulses appeared.

His aura swiftly broke through the bottleneck of the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Throwing his punch forth, an ancient true dragon appeared with golden light emitted from his fist. As his punch came in contact with the ‘Ming’ word, the word separated into a sun and a moon before dissipating.

Huang Xuanyi’s expression was indifferent. Even if he was shocked, he didn’t show it on his face. He then waved his hand, summoning a sun in his palm. But he didn’t stop there, he further empowered the sun with the Great Sun Saint Seal before unleashing it towards Lin Yun.

Under the immense pressure from Huang Xuanyi’s attack, cracks began to appear on the ground, which shocked everyone.

Lin Yun wanted to execute the Azure Dragon Grasp by instinct to send it back. But recalling that he once fought with Huang Xuanyi, Lin Yun hesitated. If he could use his sword technique and Sovereign Dragon Fist, he was confident that he could suppress Huang Xuanyi with three attacks, which wouldn’t be so troublesome.

Taking the attack head-on, Lin Yun groaned and was sent flying away.

“Universal Reversal, Divine Sun and Moon!” Huang Xuanyi hovered in the air and turned around. Heaven and earth beneath him intertwined into a sea of clouds as the sun and moon combined into an altar with a deity standing on it. It was as though everything in this world was beneath its feet, and this greatly shocked everyone in the surroundings.

“Oh, my god. Is this a holy land’s genius?”

“Huang Xuanyi is too terrifying!”

“Lin Xiao is dead now. He’s too daring to jab at Huang Xuanyi’s sore spot!”

“I’m afraid that even Flower Burial might not be able to fight Huang Xuanyi now.” The guests at the West Garden Banquet cheered.

“Father, Lin Yun is dead now!” Jiang Feng rejoiced at this scene and turned to Jiang Yu beside him.

Jiang Yu smiled, “I already said that he’d be in trouble sooner or later. He’s courting death to act with such arrogance when he’s all alone. I’m afraid that no one can save him now.”

“It’s a bargain for him to die so easily. A mad dog like him should be tortured before being killed, taking revenge for the slaps he gave me back then.” Lan Hongyan said.

“No worries. Huang Xuanyi definitely won’t let him die so easily.” Xu Dongfei commented.

On the other hand, the Wind Edge Lord wore an amicable expression, smiling as he saw this scene. But he had no intentions of stopping Huang Xuanyi.

“Lin Xiao, kneel!” Huang Xuanyi pushed his hands forth, and the deity on the altar also pushed out a palm towards Lin Yun. In the path of that palm, countless spiritual runes shattered from the pressure, and anyone could tell how powerful this strike was.

After seeing that Huang Xuanyi had gotten stronger after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, Lin Yun inwardly sighed because he knew he wouldn’t be able to stop Huang Xuanyi if he didn’t use some of his trump cards.

Since he couldn’t use the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, he could only resort to the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. A demonic cauldron rose out from his ocean of dragon origin.

When the demonic cauldron flew out, Lin Yun’s aura surged, and the aura he gave off was comparable to someone at the eighth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. When the torrential demonic aura from the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon poured into his eyes, his eyes became dark crimson.

With a wave of his right hand, the palm of the deity charging down was shattered, and the cracks soon spread to its arm. In the next second, this ‘deity’ shattered into millions of pieces. Meanwhile, Lin Yun’s palm also fell onto the Divine Sun Moon Altar.

“How is this possible?!” Huang Xuanyi was shocked, looking at Lin Yun. He couldn’t imagine how Lin Yun accomplished this to resolve his ultimate attack with his physique.

“Rising Great Sun!” Lin Yun soared to the sky, and his golden radiance converted into flames. He was like a rising sun with golden radiance scattering like rain.

When the Divine Sun Moon Altar in Huang Xuanyi’s palm shattered, he was sent flying away.

“Golden Crow Wings!” Not giving Huang Xuanyi the opportunity to turn the tables around, he took a step forth, and a massive Golden Crow manifested behind him. Dashing forth, Lin Yun reached out with his hand, wanting to grab Huang Xuanyi’s neck.

Huang Xuanyi quickly retreated in panic. He had exerted everything he could, including his constellation. But right then, a pair of golden crow’s wings unfolded behind Lin Yun, casting a huge shadow over him. Not only was he giving off a massive aura, but the aura he gave off was also ancient. This immobilized Huang Xuanyi. Lin Yun then took this opportunity to grab onto his neck.

“Let go!” Huang Xuanyi roared, and he tried to struggle.

But Lin Yun merely shoved him down and slammed him against the ground. As cracks spread out on the floor from the impact, half of Huang Xuanyi’s body was embedded into the ground. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“You’re courting death! I swear that I’ll kill you today!” Huang Xuanyi glared at Lin Yun while he was pinned to the ground.

“Your eyes are disgusting.” Lin Yun said.

Before everyone could comprehend what was going on, Lin Yun swiped his left hand across like a sharp blade.
