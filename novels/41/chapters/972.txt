Chapter 973 - Conflict

Lin Yun’s sudden yell had scared everyone as they looked at him. Even Shi Xuan and Song Rui were looking at Lin Yun in doubt. But before anyone could speak, the person who attacked the wall was sent flying while being enveloped in golden flames.

The person screamed as he spit up blood, but it was too late. He was instantly incinerated. At the same time, a pair of golden eyes appeared on the wall as the patterns in the hall shined brightly. It was as if there were flames everywhere.

“Divine pupils of the Golden Crow!” Everyone felt a chill down their spines when they sensed the prestige coming from the eyes. After the eyes and pressure disappeared, the painting slowly opened.

“Those terrifying eyes!”

“He was sent flying and turned to ashes with just a single glance…”

“Those were the True Sun Flames, right?” Everyone wore a grave expression at this moment. Even Shi Xuan and Song Rui had shock on their faces. However, they were excited because they finally found a treasure comparable to a saint pellet.

Lin Yun’s eyes also flashed when he saw this scene. His warning was too late. However, he could tell that the treasure was related to the eyes.

At this moment, the atmosphere was so tense that no one dared to move. Now, everyone was worried about two different things. First, they had to worry about the eyes. Second, they had to worry about being attacked by everyone else. At the very least, Shi Xuan and Song Rui wouldn’t let anyone take the treasure.

Compared to the restrictions in the palace, human hearts were more terrifying. After all, Shi Xuan stole the Divine Firebird beast core and killed several people in the process.

Shi Xuan naturally knew why everyone was looking at him. Sweeping his gaze around, he said, “I won’t beat around the bush. I want this painting. If anyone manages to obtain it, I’m willing to trade an equivalent treasure. However, if you can’t obtain it, you better not complain when I take it.”

Everyone could tell that Shi Xuan was baiting the crowd. After all, even Shi Xuan didn’t dare to take the painting since the eyes were intimidating.

However, many people were tempted by Shi Xuan’s words. After all, Shi Xuan had many treasures like the Divine Firebird beast core. If Shi Xuan was willing to make the trade, it was a worthwhile gamble.

“Let me try.” A pinnacle third soul Heavenly Soul Realm youth nervously stepped forward. At the same time, Shi Xuan and Song Rui were nervously watching. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The youth circulated all of his origin energy as he approached the wall. He slowly reached out with his hand and focused all of his origin energy.

Suddenly, the patterns on three different walls started to light up as if the entire hall was on fire. The bizarre scene only occurred when the youth touched the painting.

Everyone became confused at this scene. Even Lin Yun started to wonder if the youth really obtained the painting.

“I got it!” The youth quickly grabbed hold of the painting. At the same time, the painting slowly opened up while absorbing half of the youth’s body.

The other half of his body that didn’t get absorbed by the painting slid to the ground. In fear, he slowly turned around from inside the painting to watch half of his body drop to the floor. Then, his body in the painting burned under the eyes of the golden crow.

With that, the painting rolled up and the runes dimmed down while the hall returned to normal. If it weren’t for the corpse on the ground, no one would believe their eyes.

The crowd, including Shi Xuan and Song Rui, were silent. It was clear that obtaining the painting wasn’t an easy feat.

At this moment, Lin Yun hesitantly stepped forward. His actions caught everyone’s attention as they wondered what he was planning.

Isn’t he afraid after what just happened? Clearly, the runes on the wall were spiritual runes that were at least in the fifth grade. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be such a bizarre array. First, someone attacked the array and suffered a backlash. Then, another youth approached cautiously, but was sucked into the painting.

It seemed like the eyes were the core of the array. The array was only activated when the painting unfolded. Lin Yun guessed that he simply needed to grab the painting before it unfolded.

“I don’t believe that an array without a master can do anything to me!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he muttered. Even if the array was strong, no one was controlling it. Clearly, this was a test.

Lin Yun mustered his origin energy and he threw a punch at the wall to forcibly break it. Under everyone’s gaze, Lin Yun’s face changed when his punch landed on the wall. He could clearly sense that as the patterns lit up on the walls, the blazing flames of the array would start circulating like stars. It felt like an ancient demonic beast’s blood was boiling inside the array and waiting for the right opportunity to attack.

Before the painting could unfold, Lin Yun moved his arm and circulated both sword sutras. His boundless sword aura gushed out and resisted the flames coming from the walls. However, cracks appeared on his sword aura as the painting slowly opened.

“This is a little troublesome,” muttered Lin Yun. If his sword aura crumbled, he would be killed the moment the eyes looked at him.

“This brat is finished.” Song Rui and Shi Xuan had disdain on their faces as they smiled coldly. Luckily for them, Lin Yun was useful in testing the runes on the wall. Suddenly, a winged human appeared behind Lin Yun with dazzling radiance. This allowed Lin Yun’s crumbling sword aura to suddenly become firm.

He managed to take it head-on? Song Rui and Shi Xuan were both shocked by this scene. Then, Lin Yun’s punch shattered the runes while he grabbed hold of the half-folded painting.

“I got it!” Lin Yun had deep joy in his eyes when he grabbed onto the painting. There was no question that the eyes contained some kind of dao rhyme that could benefit his Divine Glorysun Fist and Ten Profound Steps greatly. It might even be the key to the inheritance in the Glorysun Constellation Palace. But when Lin Yun raised his head, Shi Xuan and Song Rui were smiling in front of him.

“Flower Burial, you really deserve your reputation. I’m a man of my word. Since you’ve obtained the painting, I’m willing to pay you an astral pellet. This should be enough for you!” Shi Xuan’s eyes flashed with mockery as he held an astral pellet in his hand. The crowd clamored because Shi Xuan was basically robbing Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed at Shi Xuan coldly. First there was the sea of astral flames and now this?! Lin Yun was enraged at Shi Xuan’s arrogance.

“You really think highly of yourself. Do you need a beating?” said Lin Yun with a venomous smile.
