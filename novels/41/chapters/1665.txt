Chapter 1666 – Legend Descends (1)

Everyone was shocked by this scene, even more than when Lin Yun slew a Saint Lord. They could feel their scalps tingling and couldn’t believe this was real. The Nether Divinity Ancestor was an old monster, a top-tiered Great Saint who once fought the Radiant Sword Saint in the Ancient Barren Domain. He fought with the Radiant Sword Saint over the Ancient Barren Domain’s overlord position a thousand years ago.

That was an earth-shattering battle, and there were rumors that he had died, so everyone was surprised to see that he was alive. He had waited patiently for a millennium for the opportunity to deal with the Radiant Sword Saint, and had joined hands with Tian Xuanzi to try and take the Radiant Sword Saint’s life.

In the end, he waited for a thousand years to only be killed by Lin Yun with a slap the moment he appeared and revealed his arrogance. His saint origin was raining down from the sky, looking like an auspicious phenomenon that was enveloping a hundred thousand miles in radius. Just like that, a legendary Great Saint was killed by a junior.

Many people reached out and caught some of the falling saint origin with their bodies trembling. When the saint origin fell onto their palms, they felt a chill run down their spines and quickly tossed the saint origin away, which was comparable to saint pellets. All their faces became pale, with their legs trembling. They had realized that the Nether Divinity Ancestor really did die.

“Holy shit… What’s going on? The Nether Divinity Ancestor died just like that?” The Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s pavilion master, Chen Yu, was dumbfounded while standing beside Mu Xuankong.

“Valley Master, do you know what that treasure is? It seems to fit the description of that legendary treasure…” The eyes of the Heavenly Note Sect’s sect master were filled with shock. She had a speculation about the cloth that was wrapped around Lin Yun, but that speculation left her stumped.

“It should be that legendary treasure. Aside from that treasure, I can’t imagine anything else in this world that can unleash this power, not to mention that he also has the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.” The Profound Valley’s valley master replied a brief moment later.

“What are they talking about?” Chen Yu asked.

“That’s the Firmament Saint Cloth, the battle cloth of the Dragon Gate Lord in ancient times. The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity was said to have forged the Firmament Saint Cloth. The previous owner of that cloth was the Azure Dragon Lord, who was at the pinnacle Emperor Realm. But the Firmament Saint Cloth had disappeared in the Kunlun Realm for a hundred thousand years.” Mu Xuankong’s eyes were filled with disbelief while looking at Lin Yun.

Chen Yu was briefly stunned upon hearing that and his pupils were wide from the shock as he raised his head. The supreme treasure of the Dragon Gate that had been lost for a hundred thousand years now appeared on Lin Yun? This would shake the entire Kunlun Realm!

“Firmament Saint Cloth?” Tian Xuanzi, barely fending off the Radiant Sword Saint’s attack, was stumped for a moment as he raised his head before his pupils were filled with despair. All his plans were ruined because of that Firmament Saint Cloth.

He began to wonder if he would die now. He could feel his vitality flowing out of his body with his heart filled with despair. Even if he had the means to protect himself, he couldn’t execute it because he would lose his life if he relaxed. But if he didn’t let go, he would still die sooner or later with his vitality flowing away.

After killing the Nether Divinity Ancestor with a slap, Lin Yun descended to the ground and gasped for breath. He might seem to have easily killed the Nether Divinity Ancestor, but all of his mental energy was drained, and he could even sense that the power of the Firmament Saint Cloth had significantly decreased after that attack.

It wasn’t easy for him to use the Firmament Saint Cloth because he had yet to receive its acknowledgment. If he knew that the power was so great, he would’ve used it to kill Tian Xuanzi earlier.

It was his ultimate trump card, but now he would have to leave the Sword Sect after using it. If he continued to stay in the Sword Sect, he would only bring endless trouble to the sect. Then again, this was also because Lin Yun didn’t expect the Firmament Saint Cloth to be so powerful. But at the very least, he managed to help his master.

Who could’ve imagined that Tian Xuanzi would have another Great Saint hidden up his sleeve? Based on the aura that Great Saint was giving off, his cultivation was more terrifying than Tian Xuanzi’s. It was worth helping his master through this ordeal.

“Let’s go and help master!” Lin Yun briefly gasped for his breath. Since he could still use the Firmament Saint Cloth, he might as well use this opportunity to kill Tian Xuanzi. He could sense that his control over the Firmament Saint Cloth was slowly disappearing, and the Azure Firmament Saint Seal was flickering within his body.

Suddenly, the radiance of the Radiant Sword Saint had dimmed, and plum petals were flying out of his body. The Radiant Sword Saint’s face also gradually became younger, and it didn’t take long for the Radiant Sword Saint to become an elegant youth.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun raised his head to look at the Radiant Sword Saint with an ill premonition. Did his master manage to make a breakthrough?

But that made no sense. If his master could reach the Emperor Realm by killing Tian Xuanzi, his master would’ve long become an Emperor. His master had a wide breadth of mind. Not only did his master have the ambition to become an Emperor and catch up to the Nine Emperors, but he even had the ambition to surpass them.

Others might not know, but Lin Yun knew it well because this was how his master had taught him.

“Mhm?” Tian Xuanzi was briefly stunned before he rejoiced. He instantly knew what was happening and couldn’t help laughing aloud.

“Is my time up now?” The Radiant Sword Saint’s eyes became bitter because the time was shorter than he had imagined. He initially thought that he had at least an hour.

“Radiant Sword Saint, it looks like my time has not ended! Hahaha!” Tian Xuanzi laughed and flicked his finger to knock away the sword before pushing out a palm.

This changed the Radiant Sword Saint’s face, and he quickly turned the sword around to block this palm. If it was in the past, one sword from the Radiant Sword Saint was enough to send Tian Xuanzi flying away. But now, he only managed to block Tian Xuanzi’s palm.

“Hahaha! So that’s the case!” Tian Xuanzi rejoiced, and his aura exploded once more. When the two fought, the Radiant Sword Saint’s advantage over Tian Xuanzi was overturned. The Radiant Sword Saint’s sword aura grew weaker as he fought, and it didn’t take long for him to be suppressed by Tian Xuanzi. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What’s going on?” The faces of the three powerful sects’ sect masters changed as they turned to look at Mu Xuankong. They wanted to help, but there was nothing Saint Sovereigns like them could do in a battle between Great Saints.

“If I’m right, Martial Uncle Radiant’s lifespan has been maintained by the myriad year saint vein of my Sword Sect. But because he has been away from his abode for too long, his life is coming to an end. He has to immediately return to the Sword Sect.” Mu Xuankong said.
