Chapter 1620 - Danger

After stabilizing his cultivation, Lin Yun started practicing the Sovereign Dragon Fist. Regardless of the intent contained within the Sovereign Dragon Fist or the magnifying lethality, it required a boundless vitality to support it.

In the past, Lin Yun could only reach lesser mastery, no matter how much he practiced. After all, this was a dragon spirit martial technique. Even if it was incomplete, it wasn’t something he could practice at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm without a corresponding cultivation technique.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

But it was better now after reaching the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. He had a terrifying vitality, to begin with, and the transformation of his vitality after his breakthrough was even more frightening. Ordinary people’s vitality would be comparable to a dragon after reaching the pinnacle third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

But Lin Yun’s vitality was already comparable to a dragon before reaching the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and his vitality now was equivalent to ten dragons.

On the first day, Lin Yun tried fifty thousand times before his vitality and dragon origin was utterly exhausted.

On the second day, he attempted sixty thousand times, and the first form of the Sovereign Dragon Fist managed to unleash three hundred dragons. When he thoroughly exhausted his vitality, he refined the saint elixirs left behind by Xuan Feng and Chen Tao to recover.

On the third day, Lin Yun attempted eighty thousand times and was utterly exhausted. But his first form of the Sovereign Dragon Fist managed to unleash six hundred dragons, and he worked hard in his cultivation.

Every time he finished, he would over-exhaust himself, and his entire body would ache. He often wanted to sleep immediately, but he knew he couldn’t stop or all his hard work would go down the drain. Ultimately, he gritted his teeth and endured for six days before he unleashed a thousand dragons.

“Soaring Divine Dragon!” Hovering in the air, Lin Yun unleashed countless dragons from his body after forming the Sovereign Dragon Seal.

Every dragon was shrouded in azure light, and a thousand dragons immediately dove down from the sky with a boundless dragon aura spreading out. With the dragons encircling him, Lin Yun’s aura reached a terrifying height, and the aura he gave off instantly grew from the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm to the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

The breakthrough in a martial technique of this level allowed Lin Yun’s aura to break through the restriction of cultivation and reach a terrifying height. Each of the dragons was infused with his vitality, and each dragon looked vivid, emitting a divine dragon aura.

“Come back!” Lin Yun roared after his aura reached its peak. The vitality in his body was utterly incinerated as a thousand dragons shrouded his arm before manifesting into a massive dragon claw. The claws were sharp, and he clenched his fist before throwing a punch, destroying a barren mountain a few hundred miles away.

“What power!” Beads of sweat rolled down Lin Yun’s forehead, but he inwardly rejoiced. The Sovereign Dragon Fist finally looked like a dragon spirit martial technique, and he succeeded.

“It should be at greater mastery now.” Lin Yun muttered to himself. If he took a step further and reached complete mastery, it would be a terrifying phenomenon of myriad soaring dragons.

With this trump card, he wouldn’t fear anyone in the Profound Sky Sect. In addition to the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, even if he had a disadvantage in his cultivation, the number of people who could fight him on the Ancient Barren Battlefield wouldn’t exceed the fingers on one hand.

The only possible threat would be Qin Tian. Qin Tian was ranked first on Profound Sky Sect’s Inner Ranking, and Tian Xuanzi personally taught him.

“Time to gather with the rest. I wonder how senior sisters and the others are doing.” Lin Yun smiled and looked forward to gathering with the party.

The Ancient Barren Battlefield was massive. As a battlefield for deities, many forbidden zones were impossible for Dragon Pulse Realm experts to enter. After one month of searching, many people had a harvest, but they still weren’t satisfied. Countless geniuses were still searching around, wanting to obtain more benefits before leaving.

There were many saint elixirs in the Ancient Barren Battlefield that were rare in the outside world. Still, the most significant opportunity was inheritances left behind by Great Saints, which weren’t easy to find. He could sense that many people were wandering in the depths of the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

This was because ordinary saint elixirs could no longer satisfy them, and the competition there was also more intense. As for inheritance-related treasures, the competition over them was even fiercer.

When Lin Yun reached the depths, he could see phenomena occasionally appearing, and the competition here was insane. But he didn’t stop and swiftly left. He had no interest in those treasures because a Nether Saint Sword was sufficient for the Divine Firmament Peak to rise and increase the Sword Sect’s foundation.

He only wanted to gather with the other disciples now, and he wouldn’t stop if there weren’t any priceless treasures. Right then, he could sense a faint tremble from the medal on his waist, and he stopped. “A fellow disciple?”

Since there was a commotion from his medal, there was another disciple of the Sword Sect within a hundred-mile radius.

“It should be over there.” Lin Yun briefly sensed it before bolting over. It didn’t take long for him to appear on a damaged pavilion looking ahead.

Meanwhile, everyone who saw Lin Yun was surprised by his speed because they couldn’t even sense a faint breeze. Lin Yun was like a shadow streaking forth.

Four people were ganging up on one person on a pavilion a thousand meters away. They were strong, and they were practically at the pinnacle third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. The strongest one was at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and the aura this person gave off wasn’t any weaker than Xuan Feng or Xiao Kui.

Lin Yun could instantly tell that they were disciples of the Profound Sky Sect, and this person should be ranked in the top ten on the Inner Ranking. The Sword Sect’s disciple being besieged wasn’t weak, but he wasn’t the opponent of the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples.

Every time he wanted to charge out, the black-clothed youth would sneer and heavily injure the Sword Sect’s disciple. As this process repeated several times, the aura of the Sword Sect’s disciple was no longer as powerful as before.

“Gongsun Yan?” Lin Yun was surprised because he recognized the Sword Sect’s disciple. But why would the Profound Sky Sect gang up on Gongsun Yan? Why would someone ranked in the top ten in the Profound Sky Sect make a move against Gongsun Yan? Was it over a treasure?

But he wasn’t in a hurry since Gongsun Yan’s life wasn’t in danger, and he wanted to observe the situation before moving.

“The Profound Sky Sect only knows how to gang up on someone?” Gongsun Yan roared, looking at the black-clothed youth while wiping the blood off his lips.

“Do you think you’re qualified?” The black-clothed youth smirked. He stretched out his hand and released a golden flame on his palm. As the flame swiftly expanded, it formed into a sun. The sun became gigantic when he raised his hand and rose to the sky.

Profound Sky Canon—Lesser Heavenly Sun!

Lin Yun instantly recognized the black-clothed youth's technique, which meant that this person probably reached a high level in the Profound Sky Canon. He shattered Gongsun Yan’s sword aura with just one move, causing the latter to throw out a mouthful of blood.

“You’re not my opponent, even if I only use one hand. Where did you get the guts to fight me from?” The black-clothed youth snorted. “If our senior brother didn’t say to capture any Sword Sect’s disciple, do you think I’d make a move on someone like you?”

Gongsun Yan’s face changed, and he gritted his teeth, “Kill me if you want. No need to humiliate me like this!”

“So what if I’m humiliating you?” The black-clothed youth smirked. “You’re just a piece of trash. Let me see how tough your bones are!”

As his face became cold, he glowed with golden light, and a massive pressure enveloped Gongsun Yan. Gongsun Yan tried to gather his sword aura, but his attempts were futile before this enormous pressure.

“Kneel!” The black-clothed youth roared and pressed down with his palm.

Right then, an azure dragon roar echoed, which stopped the black-clothed youth. He no longer suppressed Gongsun Yan and shifted to face the palm coming at him, “You’re courting death!”

When the two palms collided, the black-clothed youth, who went by the name Zhao Sun was surprised. The dragon origin contained in this attacker’s palm was more substantial than he had imagined. This caught him by surprise, and took three steps back.

“Who is it?!” The faces of the other Profound Sky Sect’s disciple changed. They started looking around.

“No need to look for me, for I am here.” Lin Yun shook his arm and instantly flew over, pulling Gongsun Yan from the ground.

“Senior Brother Lin!” Gongsun Yan exclaimed when he saw Lin Yun before his face changed, “Leave quickly!”

“It’s really Lin Yun!” When the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples saw Lin Yun, they were briefly stunned before they rejoiced.

“Third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm?” The black-clothed youth was briefly stunned before he wore a disdainful expression, “And here, I thought the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple that my senior brother was looking for was strong. I never expected that you’re just a piece of trash at the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm!”

“Looking for me?” Lin Yun was surprised to hear that, but he soon sensed something wasn’t right.

“Senior Brother, leave quickly. Senior Sister and the others are trapped in the snow valley by the eight big sects summoned by Yan Kong. Liu Xu didn’t see you, so he’s sending disciples to look for you now.” Gongsun Yan said quickly.

“How did you make it out?”

“Zhao Yan made a move several times, trying to let us break free from the encirclement. I was fortunate to charge out, but they still caught up to me…” Gongsun Yan said helplessly.

“What about Ye Ziling and Senior Sister Mu?”

“I don’t know.”

Lin Yun’s face drastically changed, with killing intent filling his pupils, “Let’s go!”

“Go? You think you can leave?” Zhao Sun sneered, “Surround them! Don’t let either of them escape!”
