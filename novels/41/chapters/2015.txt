Chapter 2016 - Wang Muyan

But Wang Muyan didn’t dwell on it for long, not to mention she didn’t think Ye Qingtian could find the Udumbara Flower. It was practically impossible.

She turned to look at Ye Qingtian and knew that he must’ve gotten stronger by at least onefold during this period. He probably used the Udumbara Flower as a disguise to search for another opportunity, and he had already found it.

After she landed on a rock, she gently tapped her foot on it and appeared before the two of them.

“As expected of Ye Qingtian. The outside world is already collapsing, and yet you’ve gotten so close to the Bai Clan’s princess,” Wang Muyan smiled.

Bai Qingyu blushed and quickly changed the topic, “Senior Sister Muyan, why are you here?”

Wang Muyan smiled and said, “I’m here for Ye Qingtian. Don’t stay in the Myriad Graves Valley any longer; we need your help. Otherwise, the Serene Dust Great Saint’s disciple might get killed!”

Lin Yun’s heart sank, and released his murderous intent. Although he disguised it well, it was noticed by Wang Muyan. The powerful murderous intent that he gave off naturally surprised Wang Muyan. She didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to be so concerned about the Profound Maiden Xan Yin.

She had no change on her face as she secretly took a few steps back and got close to Bai Qingyu.

“What happened?” Bai Qingyu asked nervously.

Wang Muyan smiled and shared what happened at the treehouse inn. However, she hid her performance at the inn. As she spoke, she examined Ye Qingtian’s expression and noticed no changes, which left her briefly stunned.

“Nangong Fuye is dead?” Lin Yun asked.

“No, but his foundation is practically crippled. This is the outcome of Jin Xuanyi not holding back,” Wang Muyan said.

“How is this possible…?” Bai Qingyu was surprised. “Senior Brother Nangong is strong and a direct disciple of a Saint Sovereign. He can make a breakthrough to the Quasi-Saint Realm anytime he wanted. So, how can he possibly be defeated with a palm? If that’s really the case, doesn’t it mean that Jin Xuanyi is a little too terrifying?”

“This is why he’s confident to set up an arena to challenge the six holy lands. If you don’t show up anytime soon, Profound Maiden Xan Yin can only go up alone. After all, she was the one who gave him the Divine Blood Flower,” Wang Muyan said.

“Jin Xuanyi isn’t a fool and won’t be foolish enough to clash with the six holy lands head-on. He won’t dare to do anything to Profound Maiden Xan Yin. After all, the Serene Dust Great Saint isn’t a pushover,” Lin Yun said.

“Ye Qingtian, I never expected you to be so heartless. You’ve cultivated under the Serene Dust Great Saint for some time, so you should be friends with Profound Maiden Xan Yin,” Wang Muyan coldly said.

Lin Yun was calm as he glanced into the distance and said, “You’re the Heavenly Dao Sect’s Holy Maiden. You did not go to find a solution after losing the Divine Blood Flower, but left to look for me, someone who’s only at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage? What are you plotting?”

“Others don’t know, but I know you can compete with the top ten on the King Ranking!” Wang Muyan smiled.

Lin Yun merely replied with a smile. Bai Qingyu also noticed something wasn’t right between Ye Qingtian and Wang Muyan, and her expression became weird. Lin Yun took two steps and asked, “Did you learn about that from Indigocloth Venerable?”

“Junior Brother Ye must be joking. I have already told you what I needed to say, so it’s up to you whether you want to come or not,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“Holy Maiden, why leave so quickly since you’re here?” Lin Yun suddenly made a move and reached out to grab Wang Muyan. He took several steps earlier and was already in the perfect spot to make a move.

Wang Muyan squinted her pupils and was shocked, but she didn’t panic as she moved closer to Bai Qingyu.

This made Lin Yun frown, but he could only give up.

When Wang Muyan circled Bai Qingyu, she instantly appeared a thousand meters away. She said in a heartbroken tone, “Ye Qingtian, you’re really ruthless. Have you forgotten about all of the time we spent together? You even called me ‘baby’ and yet you want to kill me now.”

“I only wanted to probe your strength. As expected, your means are breathtaking despite not having a high cultivation. With you around, the Heavenly Dao Sect will definitely be able to take the Divine Blood Flower back,” Lin Yun said.

Wang Muyan squinted her pupils and gritted her teeth, “Ye Qingtian, you’re really humble, and this is unlike you.”

Ye Qingtian could easily kill Xiao Jingyan and Indigocloth Venerable, but he still pretended to be weak.

Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered to waste time with her and said, “You better leave before I change my mind about killing you.”

But Wang Muyan didn’t seem bothered by what he said and smiled, “Ye Qingtian, you will definitely go there. I understand you well. I’ll wait for you at Six Holy City a month from now.”

When she was done speaking, she gradually disappeared before Lin Yun and Bai Qingyu.

“Why didn’t you force her to remain here?!” Lil’ Purple said furiously when she came out of the Iris Secret Realm.

“She’s not alone,” Lin Yun said. Not only that, he failed to see through her strength, not to mention Bai Qingyu was around. So he had his hands tied up.

“That woman is really despicable. She’s clearly trying to get you to fight Jin Xuanyi,” Lil’ Purple furiously said.

“How did she know that I was here?” Lin Yun asked.

Bai Qingyu had guilt on her face, before she said while taking out a jade jewel, “That’s because of me. She’s worried for my safety and gave me this jade jewel so that she can find me no matter where I go.”

Lin Yun instantly understood what was going on as he received the jade jewel. Wang Muyan was also probably the one behind why Bai Qingyu came after him. Bai Qingyu was pampered and impulsive, which made her easy to manipulate. But Wang Muyan probably didn’t expect Bai Qingyu to become close to Lin Yun instead. Now that he thought about it, Wang Muyan was a real schemer.

“Is Senior Sister Wang really a bad person?” Bai Qingyu asked softly.

Lin Yun didn’t reply to that question because he didn’t like to determine someone with the terms good or bad. He explained, “She was the one who sent Xiao Jingyan and Indigocloth Venerable. Even Jin Xuanyi might be related to her.”

Bai Qingyu could feel a chill down her spine when she heard that and was filled with regrets. She was best friends with Wang Muyan, but Xiao Jingyan wanted to kill her. Her face became pale, and she asked, “H-How can she be like that… How can the Heavenly Dao Sect accept her?”

Lin Yun didn’t reply because he had already seen through what kind of person Wang Muyan was. The Heavenly Dao Sect might seem like the strongest of the six holy lands, but it was already on the brink of collapsing.

Someone must’ve detected Wang Muyan’s secrets, but they could do nothing to her with the Wang Clan’s status within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Are we really going to let her go like that?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“There’s no need to hurry. It’s still not the time to fall out with her. She’s too cautious, and there’s something weird with her strength,” Lin Yun said. He roughly speculated that Wang Muyan was the Divine Blood Moon’s holy maiden or even divine maiden, and her objective within the Heavenly Dao Sect was to search for the Solar Lunar Divine Rune.

As for why, he had no idea about that. So he might even become her enemy. But he could do nothing because the Heavenly Dao Sect was even more complicated than the Sword Sect. So he decided to hand this matter to the Dragon Origin Great Saint and the Serene Dust Great Saint. It was inappropriate for him to get involved in this matter.

“Don’t worry about her for now. The utmost importance is to find the Udumbara Flower,” Lin Yun said.

“Big Brother Ye, I’m sorry,” Bai Qingyu said softly.

“What are you talking about? You’re also a victim, not to mention we still have to rely on your help to find the Udumbara Flower,” Lin Yun smiled.

“We will definitely find it!” Bai Qingyu said. She was determined to find the Udumbara Flower for Ye Qingtian, no matter what.

Lin Yun hovered in the sky and confirmed that Wang Muyan had left before making a move. He reached out to capture a thousand-year Blood Crow to use as their mount and headed for the secret realm. The journey was smooth. Lin Yun then knocked the Blood Crow out before entering the secret realm.

The secret realm was a flourishing celestial world, and Lin Yun instantly noticed the ancient altar. The altar was massive and looked like a tall mountain that had been sliced off.

Beneath the altar, there was a grassland decorated with various bizarre flowers. He could even see ancient trees that were emitting a faint saint radiance and understood that they were extraordinary with a glance.

“It’s really beautiful!” Bai Qingyu exclaimed.

Lin Yun was also captivated by the scenery, which was a drastic comparison with the outside world. He soared to the sky with Bai Qingyu and headed to the altar, “Let’s go and take a look at the altar.”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
