Chapter 1660 – Oh, Azure Dragon, Aid Me!

When Yu Qingfeng drew his sword, the battle outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield was still ongoing. Eight Saint Lords were fighting in the sky, and none could do anything to the other. It was hard for them to determine a victor anytime soon.

On the other hand, Tian Xuanzi was in complete control of his fight against the four Saint Sovereigns, and he could even occasionally free his hand to help out in the battle between Saint Lords.

Mu Xuankong had unleashed various attacks and even brought out his Sword Domain. But it was a pity that no one could break out of Tian Xuanzi’s domain. Fortunately, Mu Xuankong and Chen Yu had a strong rapport while facing Tian Xuanzi head-on. At the same time, the Profound Valley’s valley master created saint diagrams, and the Heavenly Note Sect’s sect master constantly unleashed mental attacks.

But the situation on the ground wasn’t that optimistic. Lil’ Red could still face the Nine-Tailed Fox in the beginning, not to mention that it had cultivated the martial techniques of the Dragon Clan and even had an inheritance saint artifact like the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff. Paired with the Ancient Dracoape Art given by Yue Weiwei, it could evenly face the Nine-Tailed Fox. But as time passed, Lil’ Red gradually fell into a disadvantageous position because Nine-Tailed Fox’s pupils could connect with the lightning in heaven and earth.

Not to mention that each of its tails was blazing with different colored flames that were over a hundred feet long. As various energies gathered on its tails, it could even unleash terrifying energy balls, and the Nine-Tailed Fox’s eyes could summon the power of ancient lightning. Moreover, it had a fast speed. Initially, it was just caught by surprise. After the Nine-Tailed Fox got used to it, Lil’ Red was the only one taking a one-sided beating.

After another confrontation, the Nine-Tailed Fox let out a roar and terrifying blood runes appeared on its fur. The runes were emitting an ancient aura that looked like origin divine runes but also released demonic light. Simultaneously, the bloodline power contained within the Nine-Tailed Fox began to awaken.

The next second, the Nine-Tailed Fox released a crimson energy ball from its mouth. The crimson energy ball was like a blood moon enveloped in lightning that flew towards Lil’ Red.

While the crimson energy ball flew over, nine different colored fireballs were gathering on its tails. As the tails began to wriggle, the ground began to tremble, with the surrounding space distorted. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The crimson moon couldn’t be avoided and landed on Lil’ Red. As Lil’ Red threw out a mouthful of blood, it was sent flying away, and the massive dracoape that had manifestation in the air also began to crumble. On the other side, after the black-robed Saint Lord experienced Lil’ Purple’s bizarre flames, it no longer dared to face her head-on and started to probe her. But with his right hand enveloped in the cold flames, he had to use most of his saint origin to resist the fire and couldn’t bring out his full strength, thus making him feel aggrieved.

After Lil’ Red suffered a severe injury, it sustained a one-sided beating from the Nine-Tailed Fox’s tails. Even though Lil’ Red tried to block the attacks with the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff, it still fell into a disadvantageous position and kept throwing out blood.

After taking another heavy blow, the dracoape fell to the ground and could no longer get back up, even after some time had passed. The Nine-Tailed Fox no longer bothered with Lil’ Red and turned to look at Lin Yun.

As it charged towards Lin Yun, it unleashed a speed faster than lightning, and it was about to reach Lin Yun in the next second. Suddenly, the dracoape on the ground let out a ferocious roar, grabbing onto one of the Nine-Tailed Fox’s legs before throwing it away, “Get lost!”

When the Nine-Tailed Fox collided with a mountain, the entire mountain snapped with rubbles rolling down. Under the pain, the Nine-Tailed Fox dashed out, crushing all the rubble in its mouth as it bared its fangs.

Right then, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes. He had fully recovered his vitality, mentality, and dragon origin. When he saw the Nine-Tailed Fox slamming against Lil’ Red and even using its front paws to slam down, Lin Yun lost it.

“Azure Dragon!” Lin Yun didn’t even think to raise the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and soared to the sky. As a terrifying aura swept out from the Sovereign Saint Artifact, Lin Yun soared to the sky and slammed the umbrella against the Nine-Tailed Fox.

“Big Brother, you’ve recovered!” Lil’ Red said joyfully as it wiped the blood off its lips.

“You rest, first.” Lin Yun said, feeling heartache for Lil’ Red.

“Hehe, I’m fine. I have thick skin, and I can take a beating!” Lil’ Red grinned despite it being heavily injured.

When the Nine-Tailed Fox was sent flying back, it raised its head and let out a ferocious roar before flames began to blaze on its tails. When a crimson moon appeared once more, it was filled with ancient and violent energy.

“Open!” But Lin Yun didn’t panic and opened the umbrella to block this attack. But even so, he still felt a massive tremor in his internal organs, with fine cracks appearing on his skin. If it was someone else in his position, that person would’ve died even with the umbrella.

“Mhm?” The Nine-Tailed Fox looked at Lin Yun, perplexed. It couldn’t figure out how Lin Yun managed to withstand this attack.

Lin Yun’s face became sinister because he had been one-sidedly bullied by the Profound Sky Sect since he came out of the Ancient Barren Battlefield. When he came out, the Samsara Edict Realm experts first wanted to take his life. In the end, even Saint Lords and Tian Xuanzi appeared. Now, even a mere cat tried to bully him?

What gives?! What did I do wrong?! The ferocity in Lin Yun’s pupils reached a terrifying height, and the purple diamond mark on his forehead made him look even more bewitching. While his blood began to boil, he was like an awakened beast while staring at the Nine-Tailed Fox.

“Since you want to play, I’ll play with you!” Lin Yun could feel his blood coursing through his veins, filling his body with massive energy. Stomping his foot on the ground, he poured all the dragon runes into the umbrella. As the umbrella shone brightly, some of its saint runes that hadn’t been previously activated were activated.

As the thirty-sixth layer of heaven shattered, an ancient constellation in the starry sky opened its eyes.

“Oh, Azure Dragon!” Lin Yun roared with his azure robe violently fluttering in the wind. At this moment, the power of the Azure Dragon Saint Physique was fully unleashed. When he raised the umbrella, it felt like he was lifting an entire mountain, and the second restriction on the umbrella was lifted under the gaze of that ancient constellation.

When nine dragon souls flew out, each was comparable to a nirvana stage expert. When the nine dragon souls attacked simultaneously, the Nine-Tailed Fox flew away, covered in blood. After the Nine-Tailed Fox let out a miserable howl under the terrifying fluctuation, it was beaten back to its cat form as it ran away.

When Tian Xuanzi saw this scene, his face was dark, but he held it in and continued to face the four Saint Sovereigns.

Landing on the ground, Lin Yun gasped his breath whileholding onto the umbrella. It wasn’t easy to control this Sovereign Saint Artifact, and he could barely unleash an attack at his peak form. But before he could catch his breath, the black-robed Saint Lord fighting with Lil’ Purple summoned five layers of heavenly screens, with a golden wheel in each screen.

When Lin Yun saw this scene, his pupils squinted. The black-robed Saint Lord then shook the flames on his arm away before unleashing an attack, dispersing the indigo flames on Lil’ Purple’s palm. As the surrounding space trembled, Lil’ Purple was forced to retreat.

“What are you without your indigo flames? You call yourself the Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress? You’re nothing in my eyes!” The black-robed Saint Lord finally vented all the grievances he had pent up for a long time.

Finally, Lil’ Purple’s facial expression became a little grave. Lin Yun quickly rushed over and asked, “Are you all right?”

“I’m fine. He didn’t injure me.” Lil’ Purple shook her head.

“Lin Yun, I’ll be honest with you. No one in the entire Kunlun Realm can save you today! Surrender if you don’t want anyone to be implicated in it, not even the Radiant Sword Saint himself!” The black-robed Saint Lord said coldly.

As flames flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, he clenched his right fist and looked at the black-robed Saint Lord, “What have I done wrong for your Profound Sky Sect to come after me with this formation? Not only did you guys try to kill me on the Heavenly Path, but even after I arrived in the Kunlun Realm! You guys even wanted to kill me outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield. When have I, Lin Yun, offended your Profound Sky Sect? You’re really shameless as a Saint Lord to personally make a move against a Dragon Pulse Realm like me!”

The black-robed Saint Lord was briefly stunned before he shook his head with pity flashing across his pupils, “You’re right. You’ve done nothing wrong, and we’re bullying you today. What did Jian Jingtian do wrong two decades ago? This world has no absolute rights and wrongs; only the strong prey on the weak. So what if we’re bullying you today?”

It was shameless for a Saint Lord to make a move against a Dragon Pulse Realm, but so what?

“Come with me, and you might still be alive for some time. I won’t hesitate to kill you if you're stubborn and resist!” The black-robed Saint Lord said with a cold light flashing across his pupils.

Lin Yun’s lips trembled when he heard what the black-robed Saint Lord said. With a mocking expression, he muttered, “Good! Well said! Hahaha!”

His laughter was filled with rage and arrogance as his hair fluttered in the wind. He then looked at the black-robed Saint Lord and gritted his teeth, “Bully me? Did you really treat me as a pushover?!”

“How ignorant.” The black-robed Saint Lord’s pupils flashed with mockery, and he wanted to capture Lin Yun immediately. But when he raised his hand, the indigo flames he shook off began to blaze again, and fear immediately appeared within his pupils. His face also changed and became ugly, “Damn it! What’s going on?”

“Ha. You think that the Indigofrost Divine Flames that I restored with great difficulty could be extinguished so easily?” Lil’ Purple coldly looked at the black-robed Saint Lord.

“Who the hell are you?!” The black-robed Saint Lord said fearfully.

“Empress, hold him down!” Lin Yun sat down and closed his eyes with his killing intent starting to brew. He finally couldn’t hold back anymore and undid a seal on the Profound Wither Key to unleash the full power of the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

As he undid a seal, boundless energy gushed out from his heart, making him shine brightly like a bright sun.

“That’s… the inheritance of the Profound Wither Great Saint?”

“What is he trying to do here?”

“Is he insane? Is he trying to kill himself? Wait, something isn’t right…” Everyone’s attention was focused on Lin Yun.

While Lin Yun tried to control this energy, he knew that it was still a little lacking for him to unleash the third restriction on the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

“Damn it!” The black-robed Saint Lord finally sensed that something wasn’t right. As his face changed, he forcibly suppressed the indigo flames and tried to capture Lin Yun. But when he moved, he was blocked by an invisible music barrier formed with an ancient saint tune.

His face changed when he raised his head to see Lil’ Purple playing the flute. As her saint tune spread, she began to control dragons and phoenixes with their roars and cries echoing throughout the surrounding area. Shortly after, a massive heavenly dragon and divine phoenix descended onto this world and charged towards the black-robed Saint Lord.

Taking this opportunity, Lin Yun undid another seal on the Profound Wither Key, and the radiance that he gave off instantly grew tenfold. This spectacle shocked everyone because the energy surging from Lin Yun had reached an unbelievable height, but Lin Yun wasn’t using this energy to help him make a breakthrough.

While everyone could feel their scalps going numb, Lin Yun undid another seal on the Profound Wither Key. Under the power of three seals, the ancient runes on the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella were activated and the thirty-six layers of the heavens began to shatter.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his pupils shone brightly as he furiously soared to the sky and opened the umbrella.

“OH, AZURE DRAGON, AID ME IN SLAYING MY FOE!” Lin Yun roared, and the soundwaves from his roar injured many people, with heaven and earth collapsing. As a terrifying aura exploded from Lin Yun, his crimson pupils turned to look at the black-robed Saint Lord, and he roared once more, “AZURE DRAGON, AID ME IN SLAYING A SAINT!”

All thirty-six layers of heaven shattered, and a colossal being appeared from the sky. At this moment, a Sovereign Constellation had descended to the mortal realm, and this scene scared everyone because they finally knew what Lin Yun was trying to do. Lin Yun was trying to slay a saint!
