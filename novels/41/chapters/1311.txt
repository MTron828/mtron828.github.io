Chapter 1312 - Nether Dream and Devour

Turning back to look at the painting behind him, the Aurora Dragon had the head of a human and the body of a dragon, with a size reaching a hundred feet and enveloped in a boundless ferocity. Under the power of the golden painting, it had unleashed a domineering might.

“With a pair of eyes like the sun and moon, freezing all of eternity with one thought.” Lin Yun looked at the phrase of the painting and fell into deep thoughts. When his constellation unfolded, he could sense the boundless might coming from it, empowering him, and greatly boosted his strength.

This was normal because anyone would undergo a great boost in their strength upon bringing out their constellation. But Lin Yun had a feeling that there were many parts that were lacking, and the power it held could be a lot stronger, especially the phrase that could make his blood boil just by looking at it.

The phrase didn’t come from him, but from the fragments that the golden human had obtained when holding onto the ‘broken sword’ within his body. When he created his constellation, the phrase became something natural with the painting.

Lin Yun was suspicious if the phrase was only meant to suppress the ferocity of the ominous souls, since they sounded as though they possessed divine power when he recited them. When the constellations were still ominous souls within his body, Lin Yun had awakened various abilities, but he practically didn’t use them because he was afraid that those abilities would alarm the ‘broken sword’ within his body.

Those weren’t from cultivating; they were strong and heaven-defying, which made him feel uneasy. But it was different now because when Lin Yun wielded the ‘broken sword’ with the golden human, the ominous souls were converted into his constellation.

So the fear in his heart had disappeared, and he could face his heart directly now. He was determined to excavate the secrets of the ‘broken sword’. Since that was the case, then there was nothing to worry about when he utilize those abilities now.

“With a pair of eyes like the sun and moon, freezing all of eternity with one thought.” Lin Yun muttered softly. “That seems to be two different abilities. The first being the Aurora Dragon’s Eyes, and the latter should be a freezing-related ability.”

Now that he looked at it again, he had a lot more to excavate about his Sovereign Constellation. It appears that he will have to ask Lil’ Purple for advice on how to cultivate his Sovereign Constellation. After all, there were many secret techniques and abilities related to constellations that he had to excavate.

With a single thought, his constellation returned to his body. Suddenly, the colossal fortress of flowers began to tremble. When Lin Yun turned back, he could see that after the woman died, she left behind two golden runes that shone brightly.

This made Lin Yun surprised because he didn’t think there were two origin saint runes. He didn’t know if the origin saint rune had been separated into two or if the Serene Night had two origin saint runes, to begin with.

If it was the latter, then this Serene Night was a little heaven-defying. But thinking about it again, that didn’t seem impossible. After all, the woman had refined the origin saint runes into her pupils, so there might have been an origin saint rune in both of her eyes.

Circulating his firmament sword intent, he focused his sword intent on his pupils, and the light enveloping the origin saint runes slowly peeled off until the saint runes were clearly visible before him. The origin saint rune on the right was enveloped in a crimson light and looked demonic.

Although it no longer had anyone controlling it, it was still frantically devouring the surrounding spiritual energy, including the residual energy that was brought out by Lin Yun’s constellation. At this moment, he was sure that they were two different origin saint runes. One was Netherdream, which controlled fragrances to create illusions, the other was Devour, which could devour all of the essence in the world.

When the golden light in his eyes dissipated, Lin Yun had dispelled the firmament sword intent in his eyes. Right at that moment, two boundless sacred lights appeared and enveloped the origin saint runes.

When Lin Yun swept his gaze over the area, he saw the Serene Night Flame in the bud, looking as beautiful as moonlight. It was too beautiful, making him feel reluctant to refine it.

When Lin Yun clapped his hands together, a boundless sword aura swept out, enveloping the entire flower. His sword aura echoed with a draconic roar, and the flower looked like a meteorite that fell from the sky.

When the flower landed on the ground, it landed gently while being enveloped by Lin Yun’s sword intent and didn’t even raise a speck of dust.

“He can already control his sword intent so well?” Lil’ Purple was inwardly shocked because Lin Yun’s control over his firmament sword intent seemed to have reached a new height.

Spreading his arms apart, Lin Yun landed beside Lil’ Purple with Lil’ Red returning to its cat form, lying beside her.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Yun asked, looking at Lil’ Red. With Lil’ Red’s vitality, it shouldn’t be a problem for it, even with its vitality devoured.

“Something a little troublesome. That bitch’s hand touched Lil’ Red’s hand, and the origin saint rune had devoured quite a bit of Lil’ Red’s vitality. But it shouldn’t be an issue after some sleep,” replied Lil’ Purple.

It was that terrifying? Lin Yun briefly pondered. The woman was pretty strong, now that he recalled. She had a peculiar fragrance that could drag others into her illusion, and she also had the Devour saint rune that could devour everything. So if Lil’ Red was careless, all of its vitality might have been devoured.

But fortunately, Lin Yun could resist both her illusion and devour ability, not to mention that she didn’t have the chance to touch his head. So this meant that most of her means were rendered useless.

“Empress, come here for a bit.” Lin Yun finally felt relieved after seeing that Lil’ Red was fine. Then, he jumped onto the flower once more.

Lil’ Purple was suspicious, but when she went onto the flower, she was completely dumbfounded by what she saw with her face becoming red with excitement. “Two origin saint runes, holy shit…No wonder that bitch was so strong. So this Serene Night has two saint runes…Wait, this is the Serene Night Flame!”

Lil’ Purple was acting excited on top of the Snow Heed Blade with her face turning red from the joy she felt. She was so excited that she nearly jumped off the Snow Heed Blade. “Hahaha! That bitch was really our fortune star! Your harvest this time isn’t at all inferior to the underground palace!”

“Just how big of a grudge do you have with her that you’re still not letting her go after she’s dead?” smiled Lin Yun.

“Hmph!” Lil’ Purple pouted. “That’s because that bitch injured Lil’ Red and even wanted to devour me, not to mention that that bitch even tried to seduce you. This empress is still furious whenever I’m thinking about it.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he heard that. He had no idea what was in her mind. Recollecting himself, Lin Yun smiled. “One origin saint rune should be enough for the Flower Burial Sword to be upgraded to a saint artifact. Between the Netherdream and Devour, which one do you think is suitable for Flower Burial?”

“Hmm…Netherdream. The Devour Saint Rune is too demonic, and it’s not compatible with your Flower Burial. As for the Devour Saint Rune, you can give it to Lil’ Red,” said Lil’ Purple after a brief thought.

“Since it’s too demonic, will Lil’ Red be alright?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hmph, do you know what kind of saint beast the Ancient Dracoape is? It’s comparable to the eight ominous beasts, and it’s demonic, to begin with. So do you think Lil’ Red can be more demonic after refining the Devour Saint Rune?” Lil’ Purple smiled.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned when he heard that. Now that he thought about it again, what Lil’ Purple said did make sense. Without any hesitation, he took out the Flower Burial Sword from the sword box. The moment he took it out, a sword vibration resounded, and the Netherdream Saint Rune entered the sword before Lin Yun could even react.

As for the Devour Saint Rune, it was left untouched and wasn’t pulled over by the Flower Burial Sword. In the next second, the Flower Burial Sword began to brightly shine within his hand. The light was so dazzling that he had great difficulty opening his eyes, and the sword also suddenly became heavy in his hand. The ancient runes on the sword were glowing gold, and the sword also began to violently tremble in his hand.

“Quick!” Lil’ Purple urged. “Let it refine the Serene Night Flame!”

Lin Yun nodded and came before the flower bud with a grave expression before inserting his sword in it. When the sword was plunged into the flower bud, runes began to appear on the flower beneath him, and they were all heading towards the flower bud in a cobweb-like pattern.

The flower bud seemed to have come to life, emitting boundless vitality and spreading out a floral fragrance. Raising his hand, Lin Yun grabbed ahold of the Devour Saint Rune. With the saint rune shining as brightly as a sun in one hand, he held onto Lil’ Purple’s hand with the other before slowly backing away from the flower.

Half an hour later, the entire flower closed up, enveloping the Flower Burial Sword. The moment it opened up again, the Flower Burial Sword would’ve been upgraded to a saint artifact.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with anticipation because he had been waiting for this moment for a long time. After all, without an appropriate saint artifact, it was troublesome for him to fight those transcendent geniuses.

“I’ll go take a look at the cocoon. As for you, go and give this Devour Saint Rune to Lil’ Red.” Lin Yun said while handing the Devour Saint Rune over. But after a brief thought, he asked Lil’ Purple about his doubts about his Sovereign Constellation.

“Ordinary constellations are already complicated, not to mention Sovereign Constellations. Cultivating constellations can take decades or even centuries, so I’ll slowly tell you about Sovereign Constellations in the future,” said Lil’ Purple as she aloofly stood on the Snow Heed Blade.

Lin Yun smiled awkwardly. He was feeling embarrassed for Lil’ Purple at that moment. She was clearly a little brat, but he knew that he couldn’t say that, or Lil’ Purple would definitely be furious.

“How long until the great saint origin appears?”

“Roughly ten-odd days. I’m also curious about where the Profound Wither Great Saint hid the great saint origin. Because even I can’t find it after looking around.” Lil’ Purple was unhappy when she mentioned that. She had previously separated from Lin Yun because she wanted to obtain the great saint origin before someone else got to it.

She wasn’t able to find it, but the Profound Wither Island was clearly filled with the aura of the great saint origin.
