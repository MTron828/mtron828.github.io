Chapter 1541 - Promise Kept For Life

While Mu Chuan went to meet Mu Xuankong, Lin Yun briefly rested in the Cloud Soaring Peak before visiting his acquaintances. He first visited the chief disciple of the Divine Firmament Peak, Feng Luan. He gave two saint fruits to the latter before paying a visit to Gongsun Yan, Ji Shuxuan, Jin Xuanyi, and others with gifts. At last, when he met Mu Qingqing in the Scarlet Firmament Peak, he gave her three saint fruits.

“What the hell did you do outside? This is a little too unbelievable! Three saint fruits!” Mu Qingqing naturally knew how precious the three saint fruits were, and not even Samsara Edict Realm experts could take them out.

“I’m just lucky.” Lin Yun smiled, but he didn’t go too in-depth about it. Mu Chuan had informed him beforehand not to reveal anything about the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. It was best not to reveal the Blue Dragon Bone too early, especially since it had an innate divine rune.

“Why didn’t I have such luck…?” Mu Qingqing said enviously.

“Nothing can be accomplished by relying on luck alone, and luck often comes with danger. So it’s best for you not to have his ‘luck.’ You only saw his harvest, but have you considered the dangers behind it?” A gentle voice echoed.

“Big Sister!” Mu Qingqing was first shocked before she rejoiced as she turned around. An elegant lady was standing not too far away. She was Mu Xueqin.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up as he raised his head. He had seen Mu Xueqin’s painting before, but she was better in person. As she walked over, it was like a painting was being unfolded and the beauty was walking out from the painting.

“Greetings, Senior Sister Mu.” Lin Yun bowed.

Mu Xueqin’s words made Lin Yun’s first impression of her increase. He nearly died several times, and it wasn’t easy to obtain the saint fruits. After all, ninety percent of the seven demonic sects’ disciples and guests died in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, which was also dangerous for him.

It was indeed his fortune that he could obtain so much harvest, but it was a little too naive for others to think it was all luck. If any other disciple had such an opportunity, they might not even be able to make it out alive.

“There’s no need to be so polite with me.” Mu Xueqin looked at Lin Yun and smiled, “I’ve seen you several times from afar, but this is the first time I’m seeing you close up.”

Lin Yun was baffled when he heard that, and Mu Qingqing smiled, “I told my big sister what you did on the Profound Wither Island when I came back, and she has been curious about you. She was watching when you entered the sect, took the test, entered the saint pool baptism, and competed in the five peaks competition.”

Her words surprised Lin Yun, and this also made him feel somewhat uneasy. Then again, it didn’t feel bad to catch the attention of such a beauty like Mu Xueqin.

Mu Xueqin glared at Mu Qingqing when she heard what her younger sister said. Even she couldn’t help feeling a little embarrassed.

“Hehe!” Mu Qingqing stuck her tongue out and changed the topic, “Big Sister, why are you back? Where’s Senior Brother Gu and the others? Are they back as well?”

“Senior Brother Gu didn’t come back this time. Heavenly Flames fell from the sky at the God Burial Forest outside the Ancient Barren Domain, revealing a complete ruin. This alarmed all the Dragon Pulse Realm experts within the Eastern Desolation, including Senior Brother Gu and Senior Brother Ye.” Mu Xueqin said.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Lin Yun and Mu Qingqing were surprised when they heard that, especially the latter, who had flames blazing within her pupils. The Senior Brother Gu she mentioned should be ranked first on the Heaven Ranking, Gu Chen. As for Senior Brother Ye, he should be ranked second on the Heaven Ranking, Ye Qingxuan.

Regardless of the God Burial Forest, Heavenly Flames, or ancient ruins, it was hard not for anyone to be tempted. Simultaneously, Lin Yun realized that only those who reached the Dragon Pulse Realm could be considered influential figures within the Eastern Desolation’s younger generation.

Based on his current strength, he couldn’t get involved with these opportunities, even if he wanted to. Even Gu Chen and Ye Xuanqing might not be the protagonist in this event and merely had the qualifications to participate.

“Big Sister, you’re back for the Heavenly Pool Gathering?”

“That’s right. The Heavenly Pool Gathering might be an exchange between Elysium Core Realm disciples, but it has to be led by a Dragon Pulse Realm disciple. Senior Brother Gu and Senior Brother Ye aren’t free. So I naturally had to rush back.” Mu Xueqin explained.

When Lin Yun saw the two sisters happily chatting, he felt awkward while remaining in their presence. He took out all the remaining saint fruits and instructed Ye Qingqing to hand them to Ye Ziling and the others. They were still in seclusion on Saint Mountain.

“So many?!” Mu Qingqing and Mu Xueqin were stumped as they looked a the thirty-odd saint fruits that Lin Yun took out.

“I have to go into seclusion for some time. So I have to trouble Lady Qingqing to hand them to my senior sister and others,” said Lin Yun.

“You don’t need them?”

“These saint fruits are special; you can only consume one variety of each. Some attributes contradict each other, and I have already refined the saint fruits I needed.” Lin Yun explained. If it weren’t for these saint fruits and the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet, he wouldn’t have been able to make so many breakthroughs in such a short time.

He also consumed many saint fruits that were even more precious, but it was a pity that there were too few of them. Take the Demon-Refining Fruit, for example. One of them was equivalent to ten ordinary saint fruits.

“Oh, okay.” Mu Qingqing nodded her head.

“Oh, right. What kind of gathering is the Heavenly Pool Gathering?” Lin Yun asked. He probably had to participate in the gathering. But he was in a rush when he previously left the sect. So he didn’t have the time to ask Mu Qingqing.

“There’s a treasure within the Ancient Barren Domain called the Dragon Transforming Pool. It’s situated at the Heavenly Pool Peak and has incredible effects for Elysium Core Realm disciples who are about to reach the Dragon Pulse Realm. If they can bask in it, there’s a high chance they can condense dragon origin at the first pulse. So the pool is also called the Dragon Transforming Pool.

“Every sect wants to own it, but we agreed to hand the management to the Heavenly Pool Manor. A gathering will be held once a year, and each sect will be sending out Elysium Core Realm disciples annually. Amongst them, only those who are outstanding can bask in the Dragon Transforming Pool. In the end, it has turned into a gathering within the Ancient Barren Domain, and many Elysium Core Realm geniuses outside the Ancient Barren Domain come for it every single year…” Mu Qingqing explained, and she chuckled, “Junior Brother Lin, remember not to miss it!”

The ability to condense dragon origin at the first pulse was tempting to any Elysium Core Realm genius. Lin Yun asked, “What if that person who basks in it can condense dragon origin in the first pulse, to begin with?”

Mu Qignqing and Mu Xueqin exchanged a glance because they heard the hidden meaning behind those words. Lin Yun meant that he was confident he could condense his dragon origin in the first pulse, which was surprising.

If they sensed correctly, Lin Yun seemed to be at the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm right now. So it was practically impossible for him to condense dragon origin in the first pulse. Only those who reached the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm could condense dragon origin.

“If that person can condense dragon origin by themselves, the benefits of basking in the pool will definitely increase.” Mu Xueqin recovered from her shock and continued, “Dragon origin is different in quantity and quality.”

“I see…” Lin Yun’s eyes shone brightly with great interest.

Suddenly, a dazzling sword ray exploded from the sect’s hall and lit up the entire Sword Sect. The five peak masters, elders, and disciples were alarmed by this sword ray. When they raised their heads, they saw a dazzling sword ray flying over their heads.

“Sect Master!”

“What is he trying to do?”

“The sect master is leaving? What powerful sword intent…” Everyone was shocked that the sect master would leave the sect in such a high-profile manner. This was really rare, not to mention that they could sense a wisp of killing intent in that sword intent. By connecting this event to the Radiant Sword Saint descending on the Netherworld Hall, everyone within the Sword Sect knew this wasn’t a simple matter.

“What’s going on?” Mu Qingqing kept her smile with a hint of concern in her pupils. This was the first time she saw her father having such a terrifying killing intent, not to mention that he didn’t bother concealing it. The killing intent even contained a torrential fury.

Mu Xueqin was silent. She felt that her father was going out to establish the Sword Sect’s prestige. When she turned to look at Lin Yun, she began to wonder if this matter was connected to him after seeing the change in his expression.

On the other hand, Lin Yun was shocked beyond words. If he wasn’t wrong, this should be related to his assassination attempt by Jin Jue. He had thought that the Sword Sect would take revenge, but he didn’t expect that the sect master would personally make a move. Moreover, judging from the sect master’s aura, the sect master clearly wanted everyone in the Eastern Desolation to know about this, and he had no intention of keeping a low profile.

“Junior Brother Lin, is this related to you?” Mu Xueqin ultimately asked.

“I don’t know.” Lin Yun shook his head. He wasn’t very confident that this was related, so he couldn’t answer her. He also didn’t know if Mu Xuankong was going to the Profound Sky Sect or the Nether Divinity Clan. But there was no doubt that those two were colossal forces.

But Mu Xuankong had no hesitation in his sword intent, and his killing intent was enough to prove that blood would be shed on this trip. Mu Xuankong didn’t say anything to him, but this meant more than any amount of words. After all, Mu Xuankong wasn’t his master, but his protection for him wasn’t at all inferior to his master’s.

Lin Yun’s eyes were watery as he remembered what Mu Xuankong had said. Mu Chuan told him that the Sword Sect wouldn’t allow what happened to Jian Jingtian eighteen years ago to reenact on him, and no one could bully him as long as the Sword Sect stood for a day.

This touched a sore spot in Lin Yun’s heart because the sect master kept his promise. If he had a choice, he didn’t want the Sword Sect to take revenge for this because this wasn’t related to the Sword Sect but his personal grudges. But the sect master still chose to take revenge for him.
