Chapter 2169: Generous Reward!

Lin Yun came alone, and was surprised when he came into the main hall. Not only was the Thousand Plume Great Saint there, but the two mistresses, his master, senior brother, and Dao Yang Holy Son were also there. The scale was a little huge, but this also showed that the Thousand Plume Great Saint was on their side, and his concerns were unnecessary.

“I pay my greetings to the Thousand Plume Great Saint,” Lin Yun bowed.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re now the Heavenly Dragon Lord. This isn’t an empty title, and not just anyone within the Kunlun Realm can accept your bow, aside from Emperors,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint amicably smiled. “You managed to become the champion of this Blue Dragon Record, and this also brought glory to the sect. But I have a question, why did you reject the Empress’ invitation?”

Lin Yun was baffled, before he turned to look at Ye Guhan, who winked and gave him a smile. Since he didn’t receive any hints from Ye Guhan, Lin Yun could only reply, “This disciple already has a master.”

“Dragon Origin Great Saint, you’ve taken in a good disciple,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled. He didn’t point it out, and continued, “My disciple must’ve told you before. The sect has intentions of making you a holy son, and I will formally ask you as the Dao Yang Palace’s Palace Master. Are you willing to become the Heavenly Dao Sect’s holy son? You must know that there are many secrets that cannot be passed to you if you don’t become the holy son.”

There were naturally some secrets that were only available to holy sons. Lin Yun naturally knew that this was equivalent to binding himself with the Heavenly Dao Sect. The Heavenly Dao Sect has existed since ancient times, and they definitely had many powerful martial techniques, but he couldn’t become the holy son. He didn’t want to deceive anyone, so he politely declined.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint looked amicable, but no longer asked about it. He said, “How about this. You can just tell me what you want. Except for those secret techniques, you can make any request you want.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“If possible, I wish to obtain eighth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid.” His attitude made Lin Yun feel less stressed. He carefully added, “The quantity is a little high.”

Eighth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid was precious. The seventh-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid that Lin Yun exchanged with contribution points back then had helped him greatly. The True Dragon Saint Liquid wasn’t for himself but Lil’ Purple. He had the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, and Lil’ Purple had the Phoenix Tree. These two were big consumers of True Dragon Saint Liquid.

He was feeling uneasy because he required at least 25,000 kilograms, and this was a terrifying sum of resources. But the moment he spoke up, the Thousand Plume Great Saint laughed along with the Serene Dust Great Saint and Dragon Origin Great Saint.

“Do you know the weight of your title as the Heavenly Dragon Lord? If it’s in the other holy lands, you might receive some precious treasures,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled, stroking his beard.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint smiled, “My disciple is an honest person.”

Before Lin Yun could understand what was going on, the Thousand Plume Great Saint said, “How about this, I’ll prepare half a cauldron of eighth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid for you, along with 5,000 kilograms of ninth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid, and 500 kilograms of Divine Dragon Saint Liquid.”

Lin Yun opened his mouth in surprise with his mind buzzing. He was so shocked that he couldn’t say a thing.

“Holy shit, how generous! I’m almost frightened to death!” Even Lil’ Purple was shocked within the Iris Secret Realm.

“Let’s go with that first. When you reach the Saint Realm, I’ll prepare another droplet of divine blood for you,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled.

Before Lin Yun could come to his senses, he was further shocked by the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s words. Is that the foundation of an immortal holy land? Isn’t this a little too unfathomable? How unbelievable would it be if I became the holy son?

Seemingly to see through Lin Yun’s thoughts, the Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled, “The Heavenly Dao Sect has existed since ancient times. We’ve produced many Emperors throughout the river of time, with our branches throughout the Kunlun Realm. Three thousand years ago, we’re powerful within the Kunlun Realm, possessing the qualifications to compete for hegemony. That's why the Heavenly Dao Sect is naturally not as simple as you think. It’s not too late for you to regret now, and you will only receive more if you become the holy son of the Heavenly Dao Sect.”

Lin Yun came to his senses, and smiled, “Thank you, Thousand Plume Great Saint. Since I have refused the offer, let’s not mention it again.”

“Alright. You can tell me if you need anything else,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said.

“That’s enough, that’s enough,” Lin Yun said. The Thousand Plume Great Saint was already very generous, so generous that Lin Yun was frightened. After all, ninth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid was refined with the blood of True Dragons, containing no impurities. Not to mention it even required ten-odd saint elixirs to refine it.

The value of ninth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid was more precious than True Dragon’s blood. As for Divine Dragon Saint Liquid, Lin Yun never even thought about it before. He never expected that the Thousand Plume Great Saint would give him a droplet of divine blood after he reached the Saint Realm. So it turns out that there were deities in this world!

More accurately speaking, the Heavenly Dao Sect had deities in ancient times. Otherwise, there would be no explanation on how they had the divine blood.

“Are you looking down on the Heavenly Dao Sect? Why aren’t you saying anything? Are you not giving the Thousand Plume Great Saint face?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint reprimanded.

“I dare not.” Lin Yun awkwardly smiled because he had never experienced something like this before. He didn’t know what to ask for, and he hesitated for a long time before he asked, “Is there the complete version of the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal?”

“This is a little troublesome,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said.

Lin Yun was shocked because he thought that his request was too much.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint explained, “There are many incomplete martial techniques, and some are treasures. Most of them cannot be used, and it’s a hassle for the sect to clean up with everything piled up. So the sect won’t pay attention to it if it isn’t anything special.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched. It turned out that the level of the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal was so low that the experts within the sect never paid attention to it.

“Only unique martial techniques are specially kept, like martial techniques engraved on a divine bone or words that were engraved on a fragment of a divine artifact. Even if those are incomplete, it will cause a big stir in the world,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint explained.

“I remember there’s a fragment of the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron. It was obtained by a senior in the ruins of the battlefield between deities. I’ll find it for you later,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, before he cupped his hands together, “Thank you, Thousand Plume Great Saint!”

Lin Yun couldn’t find any words to describe his feeling, and the rewards from the sect were so generous that it made it hard to breathe.

“What else do you want?” The Thousand Plume Great Saint asked with a smile.

Lin Yun’s breathing suddenly became hurried, and he was so surprised that he lost the ability to think. But just when he was about to speak, Ye Guhan suddenly looked at him with a smile and shook his head lightly.

This made Lin Yun come to his senses, and he said, “That’s enough. I don’t need anything else.”

“Alright. I’ll get Dao Yang to deliver the saint liquid to you within three days,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said.

“I’ll send it to him. You guys can continue discussing the important matters

,” Ye Guhan said. When the Thousand Plume Great Saint saw this, he was briefly stunned.

“Ye Qingtian, take it.” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint stopped Lin Yun and threw a golden jade slip over to Lin Yun.

The golden jade slip was heavy, and Lin Yun didn’t know what material it was made of. Just holding it in his hand was taxing to him.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, “This is the third section of the Divine Firefly Sword, but I can’t teach it to you.”

“Thank you, Miss…” Lin Yun nearly called out ‘Mistress,’ but quickly changed his tone after coming to his senses, “Thank you, Martial Aunt.”

“You can leave now,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

Lin Yun was led out by Ye Guhan, but was still in a trance from the amount of rewards.

“Still haven’t come to your senses yet?” Ye Guhan smiled, chewing on a Divine Dragon Fruit.

“A little,” Lin Yun nodded.

“You still want more?” Ye Guhan smiled.

“Well, yeah,” Lin Yun scratched his head awkwardly. How could one have enough resources? Even if he didn’t need it, he could keep it and count them in his free time.

“Ha.” Ye Guhan knocked Lin Yun’s head, and smiled, “What are you thinking about? I’ll tell you honestly. Even a holy son can’t obtain so many resources.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned, and his mind cleared up when a breeze blew past. That made sense since just the True Dragon Saint Liquid was an unimaginable amount. Let’s not mention the Divine Dragon Saint Liquid or ninth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid, just half a cauldron of eighth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid alone was unimaginable to Lin Yun. After all, half a cauldron was equivalent to at least 250,000 kilograms!

“Half a cauldron of eighth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid is about one-tenth of what the Heavenly Dao Sect has in its possession,” Ye Guhan said.

“That much?” Lin Yun was startled. But he realized that something wasn’t right, and asked, “What’s going on?”

Ye Guhan casually chewed on the fruit, then said, “If a person is going to die, what’s the use of his treasures?”

“Is the Heavenly Dao Sect in trouble?” Lin Yun’s face changed.

“That’s not the case,” Ye Guhan smiled. He continued, “But who can be sure about that? Just accept it with a peace of mind. Even if you don’t take it, the four major clans will definitely take them.”

“They won’t agree to it, right?” Lin Yun asked.

“Of course, they won’t agree. After all, this is no different from cutting their flesh and drinking their blood,” Ye Guhan said with a mocking voice, then he heavily pat Lin Yun. He said in disdain, “But you’re not bad yourself. With the Heavenly Dragon Lord title, there’s nothing they can do about it, even if they have objections. If they want it, they will have to get their disciples to obtain the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title as well!”

Ye Guhan looked at Lin Yun, and smiled, “Junior Brother, you’re worthy of my love. I believe our master will be happy once he learns of it, and you have brought honor to him. When he becomes an Emperor in the future, he will surely have a face when he talks about it with others.”

Lin Yun felt a warmth in his heart and happily chatted with Ye Guhan while they walked.

“Senior Brother, there’s something I don’t understand. The Heavenly Dao Sect has such a huge foundation, so why didn’t they give more rewards to the saint disciples?” Lin Yun asked. Even the harvest of a hundred saint disciples added together for a hundred years might not be comparable to his harvest.

Ye Guhan sighed, and smiled, “It’s cruel to say this, but the sect needs geniuses the most. Not ordinary geniuses, but peerless geniuses. Otherwise, it’s useless even if we give them more resources, and it might bring disaster to them instead. For example…”

“Like me?” Lin Yun smiled.

Lin Yun said that as a joke, but Ye Guhan’s face became serious, and he said, “Like Tian Xuanzi.”
