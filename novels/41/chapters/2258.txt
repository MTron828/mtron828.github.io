Looking at the smile on Lin Yun’s face, Li Feibai speechlessly said, “You? Low profile? Who would believe that just from your clothing?”

Lin Yun helplessly sighed as he put on a mask. He then said, “Does this work now?”

“Everyone will know who you are when you move,” Li Feibai said.

Lin Yun smiled, “Alright, tell me about it, then. This mask is to fend off gentlemen, not villains.”

He was already tired of hiding his identity during his time as Ye Qingtian, so he didn’t like to wear a mask again.

Li Feibai said, “The divine flames have been discovered. They were initially found by the Divine Phoenix Mountain, who wanted to monopolize them. But they failed after various attempts, unable to break the restriction. As a result, the location of the divine flames was slowly spread out.”

“There’s a restriction?” Lin Yun asked.

“The divine flames have no restriction on them, but the region they are in does. The Divine Phoenix Mountain couldn’t break the restriction alone, so they could only negotiate about it,” Li Feibai explained. “The commotion created by the divine flames was much bigger than the Divine Blood Fruit.”

No one knew which was more valuable, the divine flames or the Divine Blood Fruit, since they both had their pros. The Divine Blood Fruit could extend lifespan and cultivation, while the divine flames might contain some inheritances of a deity.

After all, deities were long extinct in the Kunlun Realm, thus making the divine flames extremely precious. Aside from that, the divine flames could be absorbed into a saint artifact, used as the core of an array or the core of a puppet.

The Divine Blood Fruit was precious, but it didn’t have much effect, while the divine flames had multiple uses. But to a Great Saint running out of lifespan, the Divine Blood Fruit was naturally more precious in their eyes.

“Bring me there,” Lin Yun said, looking at Li Feibai.

“I’ll believe you for now,” Li Feibai said as she wore a mask. Li Feibai was also famous now because of her Sovereign Constellation that she revealed when competing for the Divine Blood Fruit.

Even Lin Yun was shocked back then but wasn’t bothered by it now because he had his own Sovereign Constellation.

“Let’s go!” Li Feibai said as she brought Lin Yun over to the divine flames.

“Where are we going?”

“The Flame Dragon Mountain. Do you still remember the Flame Dragon River? The divine flame is at the end of the Flame Dragon Valley.” The two executed their movement techniques as they bolted. They were both monstrous geniuses, and Li Feibai’s speed wasn’t weaker than Lin Yun's. As they rushed at full speed, they were even faster than third-stage Saint Lords, arriving at the Flame Dragon Mountain in less than half a day.

The Flame Dragon Mountain was a massive mountain range, and the Flame Dragon Valley was down below. So, they had to take another path. This place was dangerous since there were many spatial fragments as well as fire-attributed demonic beasts and terrifying heatwaves.

There was a long magma river at the bottom of the cliff, and it was more terrifying than the Flame Dragon River outside. At the shore, there were murals that recorded ancient legends.

The bottom of the Flame Dragon Valley was a massive and spacious valley with the complete corpse of a Flame Dragon on the ground. The surface of the skeleton was smooth, giving off a metallic luster. Someone would've taken it if the dragon skeleton wasn't so big and complete.

Many people gathered in the valley, consisting of cultivators from the other regions other than the Eastern Desolation. This valley was even bigger than where the Divine Blood Fruit was found.

Since many people had gathered outside and couldn’t go in, the atmosphere was tense. Amongst the holy lands from the Eastern Desolation, the Ming Cult took the lead, occupying the inner region of the Flame Dragon Valley, which was the head of the Flame Dragon’s skeleton. There was a region over there that was enclosed in an array that made it impossible for those who were outside to be unable to take a look inside.

“The Eastern Desolation’s holy lands are too much to join hands in the Heavenly Void!”

“The Eastern Desolation has long declined. Didn’t they see what happened to the Heavenly Dao Sect? A group of second-tiered holy lands dare to be so arrogant?!”

“That’s right. If the Heavenly Dao Sect was still around, we might have to give them some face with six holy lands joining forces together. But they’re nothing new and dare to act with such arrogance?!”

“Let’s just wait. Someone will teach them a lesson once the array breaks.” Everyone else was heated, but they didn’t dare to carelessly make a move. But what they said wasn’t exactly wrong since they now had a different perspective about the Eastern Desolation’s holy lands after the fall of the Heavenly Dao Sect. Even the demonic sects within the Eastern Desolation weren’t as fearful of the holy lands as before, not to mention those from other regions.

How crowded! Lin Yun was inwardly shocked. What Li Feibai said wasn’t wrong. The commotion caused by the divine flames was even bigger than the Divine Blood Fruit. He sensed that all the Heavenly Void cultivators were practically here. Some of the cultivators here even gave off a terrifying aura that would make Lin Yun fearful. All of them should be fourth-stage Saint Lords.

They might not be able to compete with the holy lands’ fourth-stage Saint Lords, but they weren’t inferior, judging from the aura that they were giving off. Furthermore, they were keeping a low profile, waiting for the restriction to be lifted before competing for the divine flames.

“We can’t go any further, or we might start a conflict with the holy lands,” Li Feibai said, looking at those who were guarding the inner region for the holy lands. Aside from the prestigious clans of the Eastern Desolation, everyone was stopped from approaching any further, including demonic cultivators.

“I have a way,” Lin Yun smiled and grabbed Li Feibai’s wrist before executing the Divine Tortoise Transformation. He was now cautious when it came to women, so he grabbed Li Feibai by the wrist and did not lock their hands together.

Under the Divine Tortoise Transformation, even a fourth-stage Saint Lord couldn’t detect them without looking directly at them. Just like that, Lin Yun slipped into the inner region of the Flame Dragon Valley under Li Feibai’s shocked gaze.

When they stepped in, Lin Yun and Li Feibai could sense a powerful dragon aura. This pressure was terrifying, and it was coming from the skull of the Flame Dragon. The Flame Dragon only had a skeleton left, but it still gave off a massive and powerful aura.

“How did you manage to do it?” Li Feibai was shocked by Lin Yun’s Divine Tortoise Transformation.

“Hush. Soften your voice. This is nothing and will be ineffective the moment we fight.” Lin Yun looked around and saw many familiar faces: the Ming Cult’s Huang Jingyu, the Myriad Lightning Sect’s Heavenly Kui Saint Lord, and the Heavenly Flame Sect’s Liu Yunlan.

As Li Feibai said, those three were stronger since their last meeting. They have become second-stage Saint Lords, not to mention that they gave off a deep and unfathomable feeling.

Lin Yun knew that they must have obtained a lot of treasures from the Blood Flame King’s den. He began to wonder if they still had any Myriad Demon Fruits. He had never heard of such fruits before, and the saint fruits he obtained in the past couldn’t even be compared to one-tenth of a Myriad Demon Fruit.

The Divine Dao Pavilion’s Qu Wushuang and Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Ji Zixi were also around. After Lin Yun swept his gaze over, he slowly approached the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s location with Li Feibai. The surroundings had many forces, so they weren’t too striking.

Aside from the five holy lands, there were many Ancient Saint Clans from the Eastern Desolation and powerful sects. Those forces had a good relationship with the holy lands or were subsidiary forces, allowing them to enter.

Can it be that there is more than one divine flame? Lin Yun pondered because one divine flame wouldn’t be enough when so many forces were here.

They carefully approached the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s party and found a spot to sit. Lin Yun had a pretty good relationship with the Divine Phoenix Mountain and was rather familiar with Ji Zixi, even if he was discovered.

He also had some plans in his heart because Su Ziyao told him not to let the Blood Moon Sect obtain the divine flames. In Lin Yun’s view, he could let the Divine Phoenix Mountain have it if he didn't want it. He just had no plans of letting the Blood Moon Sect or the three holy lands obtain it.

The center of the Flame Dragon Valley was beneath the Flame Dragon’s head, and it was a complicated array. The various holy lands sent out a fourth-stage Saint Lord under the help of a Heavenly Spiritualist from the Divine Dao Pavilion to break the restriction.

“Why did you pick the Divine Phoenix Mountain? You’re not going to tell me that you have a relationship with the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s little princess, right?” Li Feibai transmitted her voice over while Lin Yun observed how the holy lands would try to resolve the restriction.

“No,” Lin Yun immediately rejected.

“Ha, carry on with your act.” Li Feibai disclosed, “Many people came to that cliff when they heard that you fell down the Fallen God Valley, including the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s little princess.

“I was secretly observing the area back then, and she was anxious. She even wanted to use a treasure to probe the bottom of the valley, but the elders of the Divine Phoenix Mountain stopped her. She was forced to leave after that, and I saw that she was heartbroken. Look how cold she is right now.”

Lin Yun was stunned when he heard that and couldn’t help shifting his gaze to Ji Zixi.

“Flower Burial, do you still dare to say that you’re not a Holy Maiden Killer?” Li Feibai looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile.

Lin Yun replied, “We did have some friendship. I have previously promised her that I would visit Divine Phoenix Mountain, but it’s not like what you think.”

Li Feibai naturally wouldn’t believe it. She didn’t have a deep relationship with Lin Yun, but the more they interacted, she couldn’t help becoming curious about him. She said with a deep smile, “Flower Burial’s name is attractive to not only holy maidens but also to men. Did you know that Qu Wushuang also went to the cliff? He looked pretty sad by the cliffside and even played a song as a tribute.”

Lin Yun turned to look at Qu Wushuang, and said with surprise, “I have no friendship with him. Speaking of which, I even beat him up before.”

“Well, some people have special fetishes. Who knows, he might…” Li Feibai smiled.

“The descendant of one of the Eight Imperial Clans also knows this kind of thing?” Lin Yun asked.

“Of course. You can give it a try if you want. I can be the one beating you up,” Li Feibai said.

Lin Yun immediately shut his mouth because he realized he couldn’t judge a book by its cover. While they talked amongst themselves, a commotion came from the outer region of the Flame Dragon Valley with a powerful ominous aura gushing over.

The holy lands’ disciples responsible for guarding the inner region were sent flying away by the ominous aura.

“The trouble is here.” Lin Yun raised his head and saw that the demonic cultivators were no longer hiding themselves and were charging over. They didn’t bother concealing their demonic auras. The few who were leading the party were all fourth-stage Saint Lords.

“You guys are courting death!” Huang Jingyu opened his eyes with a cold flash in his eyes. He soared to the sky along with Liu Yunlan and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord, charging over.
