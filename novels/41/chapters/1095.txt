Chapter 1096 - Bully

Everyone was silent upon Lin Yun’s arrival. The crowd of outer disciples, inner disciples, and core disciples were staring at him coldly.

As one of the four greatest sects in the Profound Azure Manor, even an outer disciple was a talented genius that could sweep through lower realms. The inner disciples were at least in the pinnacle seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm and could make a breakthrough any time. They were the elites of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

As for the 500 core disciples, they were naturally in the Empyrean Realm. Any single one of them could sweep through the Profound Azure Manor and were top-tier experts. The ones who practiced holy spirit martial techniques were the pillars of the sect who could even defeat the experts of the older generation.

All of these cultivators were watching Lin Yun. If Lin Yun was ordinary, he would have felt his legs shake. After all, he could sense the indignity and rage in their eyes.

Carrying Lil’ Red, Lin Yun smiled because he wasn’t bothered by the looks. After all, which swordsman didn’t have a temper? If he was a disciple in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, even he wouldn’t be happy about an outsider suddenly becoming a core disciple and receiving the quota to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain.

Then again, Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by them because he would just beat up anyone who was unhappy with him. As Lin Yun approached, all the disciples opened a path for him. Not long later, Lin Yun walked up to the elders and core disciples who were on a stage. When he saw Wang Yuruo beside Ye Ziling, he even gave her a wink.

Wang Ruyuo was shocked by Lin Yun’s boldness and her face turned red. But just when she was about to nod her head towards Lin Yun as a response, Ye Ziling gave her a glare. So she no longer dared to look at Lin Yun.

Then, Ye Ziling gave Lin Yun a cold gaze of warning. However, he didn’t mind her attitude as much as Feng Zhang, who didn’t bother hiding the enmity in his gaze.

Suddenly, Lin Yun thought about what Feng Zhang said to him. There was no way he would let Feng Zhang go so easily. Just when Lin Yun was about to bow towards the elders on the stage, a figure descended down from the horizon with a boundless sword aura. He was emitting a suffocating pressure.

“Greetings, sect master.” All the outer and inner disciples bowed towards the person who had just arrived.

Even Lin Yun was surprised and cupped his hands together. Although the sect master’s cultivation wasn’t as strong as Feng Jue, his sword intent was even more terrifying.

As the sect master signaled for everyone to get back up, he said, “There’s something I’d like to announce today. I believe all of you have heard before about the rumors, and there were even some people who even attacked me verbally. They said that I’m not being impartial to all the disciples.”

His tone was filled with a wisp of rage that made all the disciples tremble in fear. Even the faces of the core disciples were unsightly, especially Feng Zhang. After all, he was the mastermind behind the rumors.

“Lin Yun!” While everyone trembled, the sect master suddenly barked and called out to Lin Yun. His gaze was like two sharp swords that pierced through space and bound Lin Yun. He could sense that the sword aura was really terrifying.

Lin Yun, who was called out, cupped his hands together and replied, “Here!”

“As a swordsman, I believe you’re not willing to let others talk behind your back. If you don’t have the capability yet to obtain what surpasses your capability, it will definitely draw the ire of others. Cowardly isn’t your style based on your infamous reputation from the Heavenly Path. Since you dare to show up, I believe you’re here to let the disciples of my Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect suffer disappointment?” The sect master’s words instantly caused a huge uproar. After all, they were here to cause trouble for Lin Yun, but now, it appeared as if the roles had been turned around.

“That old geezer is digging a hole for you and clearly placed you in the pit to roast. It’ll be embarrassing if you get trampled and it will look good for his Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect,” said Lil’ Purple from the sword box.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly because the sect master was really ruthless. If he admitted that he was here to slap their faces, the disciples would go insane with hatred. But Lin Yun would never cower.

Since they wanted to play, he would entertain them. With sharp eyes, Lin Yun smiled, “That’s right. I’ll draw the ire of others if I don’t have the capability to back up what I’ll receive. So I’m here to deal with those who are jealous!”

His words were like a bomb that dropped in the palace. Not only was Lin Yun snatching their quota as a core disciple and their opportunity to enter the Sword Saint Mountain, but he was even looking down on them?

“Is this perhaps the best the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect has to offer? I don’t think your sect’s disciples are even comparable to the geniuses on the Heavenly Path.” Lin Yun said once more, which instantly attracted everyone’s attention. Even the core disciples on the stage felt that Lin Yun’s words were too arrogant. After all, he was still in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

Covering her mouth in shock, Wang Yuruo whispered, “What is Junior Brother Yun trying to do?”

“That’s just blind arrogance,” said Ye Ziling.

Facing the uproar, Lin Yun fearlessly stood in front of the sect smaster with a smile. Since the sect master wanted to play, he would play too.

The sect master also wore a smile and replied, “As you wish. Does any disciple from my Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect want to test his qualification?”

“Guo Ming, outer disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect!” The moment the sect master finished, a disciple stood up.

Once Guo Ming stood up, the other disciples shut their mouths. Although Guo Ming was only an outer disciple, he was in the pinnacle sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. If Lin Yun couldn’t even defeat an outer disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, then there was no need to talk about Lin Yun becoming a core disciple or ascending the Sword Saint Mountain.

Seeing that he was being looked down on, Lin Yun smiled inwardly while he replied, “You’re not qualified to fight me.”

Arrogance! Even an outer disciple isn’t qualified to fight him? The outer disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had some fame in the Profound Azure Manor as they could sweep through the geniuses in the same cultivation.

Rage flashed across Guo Ming’s eyes, but he tried his best to contain his anger. “You just reached the sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, and I’ve been at this level for three months. I’m already taking advantage of you.”

Lin Yun patted Lil’ Red and smiled, “We’ll talk if you can defeat my pet.”

Seeing the black cat in Lin Yun’s embrace, Guo Ming’s face twitched with anger, “You think you’re a transcendent genius on the Heavenly Path?!”

“How about you win first? Beating my pet is the same as beating me. I don’t want to say that I was bullying you,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Bully? Don’t blame me for being ruthless! I can’t even begin to count how many demonic beasts I’ve killed with my sword!” Guo Ming said coldly. He was determined to kill Lil’ Red.

Right at this moment, Lil’ Red flew out of Lin Yun’s embrace and looked at everyone’s interspatial pouches before grinning.

“Junior Brother Guo, slay that cat!”

“That cat’s smile is really despicable!”

“Junior Brother Guo, don’t go easy on it and teach it a lesson!” All the disciples began to holler encouragement. Although the elders and core disciples could tell that Lil’ Red had the bloodline of the dragon clan, they still sneered. They thought that Lin Yun was a little too overconfident in his cat.

“This despicable cat is pretty fat. Let’s roast it tonight for supper. I bet it tastes great!” Feng Zhang’s words drew the laughter of everyone in the crowd.

Then, Guo Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold light as he got ready to attack. He soared into the sky with a sword in his hand. He didn’t want the battle to go long because it was a cat. After all, it would be humiliating if it took him too long. So he wanted to end the battle with one attack.

But just when he was about to draw his sword, the black cat suddenly disappeared. Then, a dragon roar echoed out from the horizon as a terrifying aura spread out. A huge shadow loomed over Guo Ming as a gigantic palm descended before he could even raise his head. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In the next second, his sword aura was crushed by the dracoape’s gigantic palm. Immediately, Guo Ming threw up a mouthful of blood and was smashed into the ground, which caused him to lose consciousness.

The entire ground trembled from the gigantic palm, which made everyone stare in disbelief. No one could believe the violent aura that Lil’ Red was emitting. It turned out that Lil’ Red wasn’t a tiny little cat, but an ancient dracoape. What a bully!
