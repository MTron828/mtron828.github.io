Chapter 406 - Manifestation

The Dracoscale Horses also unleashed their aura as their golden fur glowed brilliantly. The Dracoscale Guards each held a spear, which made them look like eight dragons when paired with their horses.

Their spears roared and tore through the wind resistance. The Dracoscale Guards were completely displaying their terror. There were even rumors that the eight of them could kill a cultivator in the Violet Palace Realm if they worked together.

Lin Yun looked at the eight of them charging at him and he gently patted on the Dragon Blooded Horse’s neck. Facing the eight Dracoscale Horses, the Dragon Blooded Horse unleashed a roar and lightning began to crackle on its hooves. At the same time, a crimson flame blazed on its body, along with a towering ominous aura that shot into the sky.

When the Dragon Blooded Horse took a step forward, the snow beneath the ground exploded and swept out, along with the Dragon Blooded Horse’s roar. It might seem to be a simple step, but the wind changed when the Dragon Blooded Horse’s hooves landed on the ground.

This made the faces of the Dracoscale Guards change as their horseback formation was messed up. The Dragon Blooded Horse watched this scene in disdain before it dashed forward.

The eight Dracoscale Horses fell onto the ground and trembled in fear.This caused the Dracoscale Guards to fall off their horses. The sudden outburst from the Dragon Blooded Horse made the eight Dracoscale Horses panic.

The Dracoscale Horses wouldn’t feel afraid even if they faced a demonic beast in the Violet Palace Realm, but they were actually cowering in fear under the Dragon Blooded Horse’s aura.

“Kill!” The eight Dracoscale Guards were experienced soldiers. When they fell off the horses, they slammed their palms into the ground and they charged at the Dragon Blooded Horse. Although they were weaker without their horses, they were still powerful.

On the Dragon Blooded Horse, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a hint of chill as his sword intent merged with the Dragon Blooded Horse’s ominous aura. This made the Dragon Blooded Horse’s aura surge once more.

Facing the aura, the eight Dracoscale Guards’ faces were unsightly. It felt as though there were countless swords knocking on their armor.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun pulled the reins and the Dragon Blooded Horse raised its hooves high into the sky. When its hooves landed on the ground, it felt like an earthquake as the eight Dracoscale Guards were sent flying away.

Their faces were pale and they could no longer get up on their feet. Lin Yun sat on the Dragon Blooded Horse as he coldly looked forward. The surroundings were silent because no one had expected that the Dracoscale Horses would be defeated in an instant.

The surrounding cultivators all looked at this scene with disbelief in their eyes. When they looked at Lin Yun’s Dragon Blooded Horse, they had a wisp of fear flickering through their eyes. This horse’s temper was a little too violent and the eight Dracoscale Horses lying on the ground was a huge slap to the face of the crown prince’s party.

Although Qin Yu sat on the carriage without uttering a word, anyone could sense the dense killing aura coming from his body. On the sides of the carriage, Han Lan, Wang Feng, Ji Wuheng, Tang Jie, and Bai Lixuan were also emitting a wisp of killing aura.

“Let me handle this piece of garbage.” Han Lan stood forward before anyone else could. When his gaze fell onto Lin Yun, he barked out coldly, “A cripple who broke one of his profound veins dares to mess with His Highness’ wedding? You must be courting death!”

He already wanted to kill Lin Yun when Lin Yun crippled his junior brother, Bai Yu, back in the Princess’ Banquet. But he was stopped and even defeated by Xin Jue, which made him feel humiliated. Now that his cultivation had undergone a huge boost, he was no longer the same person as he was back then.

He initially wanted to cleanse his humiliation through the Dragon Gate Competition, but it was a pity that his opponent disappeared. Although Xin Jue might be dead, Lin Yun was still alive. This was undoubtedly the best opportunity for him to kill Lin Yun since Lin Yun obstructed the crown prince’s wedding and even injured the Dracoscale Guards.

He emitted a dazzling golden radiance that contained the domineering aura of Buddhism. Combined with his killing aura, he looked like a vajra.

“Descending Demon Fist!”

“I heard that Han Lan’s Descending Demon Fist has reached complete mastery. On the other hand, Lin Yun’s strength was diminished when he shattered one of his profound veins. I’m afraid that he will lose terribly in this battle.”

“I don’t think Han Lan will let Lin Yun live. After all, Lin Yun crippled his junior brother back in the Princess Manor.” Those who knew about the enmity between the two began to comment on the situation.

When Han Lan’s aura reached the pinnacle, even the horse that he was riding couldn’t take the pressure and collapsed on the ground. Han Lan soared into the sky and then threw a fist down at Lin Yun.

“Die!” Han Lan’s origin energy formed into a secret seal that caused his fist to unleash great pressure.

“What a powerful aura!” Han Lan’s fist felt as though he could even shatter a mountain and Lin Yun looked so tiny under that fist.

“I’m afraid that you’re not capable of accomplishing that…” Lin Yun soared into the sky and he summoned his Flower Burial Sword. When he grabbed onto the sword, his quasi-xiantian sword intent poured into the sword. He might not have a strong cultivation, but his sword intent paired with his cultivation in the pinnacle eighth stage brought his aura to the same level as Han Lan.

“Sword intent?” Han Lan locked his brows together before he sneered.

“It doesn’t matter if your sword intent is powerful. Without the support of cultivation, it’s just an empty shall!” Han Lan’s aura surged violently and his fist roared, unleashing a powerful aura.

“An empty shell?”

The Iris Flower bloomed in Lin Yun’s dantian and the eighteen runes started to glow. Under the age energy, his eight profound veins emitted a dazzling radiance. His origin energy rippled and his aura began to rise from the eighth stage. When Lin Yun drew his sword, the cold gleam shined so brightly that it made Han Lan’s eyes hurt.

An unprecedented intent emitted from Lin Yun. His cultivation was clearly two stages beneath Han Lan, but his aura felt majestic like the moon. It made him seem tiny in comparison.

When Lin Yun drew his sword, he unleashed a boundless sword intent. Sensing his sword intent, Han Lan suddenly trembled and his aura began to crack under Lin Yun’s sword intent.

“H-how is this possible…” Han Lan started to panic and his confidence began to waver. “Damn it, you’re just putting up a strong front!”

Han Lan roared with a distorted face. He pushed his power to the limit and his fist began to emit traces of black aura that suddenly turned into a ferocious demonic beast.

“Holy shit, Lin Yun is going to die.” Others couldn’t see the panic in Han Lan’s heart. They could only sigh as they saw the power behind the fist.

But when Han Lan’s punch collided with Lin Yun’s sword, the one-sided defeat that everyone was expecting did not occur. Instead, a huge rumble echoed in the sky and the two were evenly matched. Before the spectators could be shocked, Lin Yun flashed out and swung out six swords.

Spring and Rain, Converging Rivers!

When the Aquaselenic Sword’s aura spread out, it looked as though Lin Yun was standing on a lake and his sword aura felt like a tsunami.

Han Lan roared furiously, but there was nothing he could do about the boundless sword aura. Ripples started to spread out in the sky and Han Lan’s aura was completely suppressed by Lin Yun.

“No!” At this moment, Han Lan felt as though he was facing an expert in the Violet Palace Realm. He couldn’t put up any resistance. After the sixth sword, his aura had entirely shattered.

“Die!” barked Lin Yun and the Flower Burial Sword moved like a luminous moon in his hand. This momentum had caused everyone to be shocked because it had exceeded their knowledge.

“Stop!” Screams suddenly rang out from the crown prince’s party and the other experts from the Azure Association soared into the sky. But Lin Yun had already unleashed his attack, so there was no way he could stop it.

As blood splattered, Han Lan’s ribs broke under Lin Yun’s sword. His body was also sent into the ground from the power behind Lin Yun’s attack.

“The manifestation stage! That’s the legendary manifestation stage!” An elder suddenly exclaimed from the crowd as he looked at Lin Yun in disbelief.
