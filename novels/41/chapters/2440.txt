Chapter 2441 - Husband and Wife United! (2)

Ye Ziling pushed her physique to the limit and empowered herself with the Lesser Heaven Authority Order to face Zhuge Qingyun of the Profound Sky Sect. For a long time, Zhuge Qingyun was known to be the strongest beneath the Saint Realm and even gave Feng Jue a terrible beating at the Profound Wither Sea.

Since Zhuge Qingyun’s cultivation was a Saint Sovereign, he relied on the Profound Sky Canon to endanger Ye Ziling. In the beginning, Ye Ziling could still put up a fight with Zhuge Qingyun, but she gradually lost her footing after more peaks began to collapse.

Zhao Yan, Gongsun Yan, Mu Xueqin, and Mu Qingqing were also covered in injuries and barely held on. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Su Ziyao is terrifying, and the Scarlet Firmament Peak is stabilized. But that doesn’t mean you all are fine!” Zhuge Qingyun had long noticed the battle on Scarlet Firmament Peak and no longer held back. Several moons appeared behind him and they devoured all of Ye Ziling’s sword intent when they revolved.

But when the moons rotated in reverse clockwise, the sword intent returned to Ye Ziling. This sent Ye Ziling flying back. Seeing this, Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan decisively stepped forth to face Zhuge Qingyun.

“What a futile struggle!” Zhuge Qingyun sneered. With his full strength and without Ye Ziling’s protection, Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan were no different from mere ants. But just when he was about to make a move, a dazzling sword ray flew over that made Zhuge Qingyun feel like his life was being threatened.

This made Zhuge Qingyun’s face change before he quickly retreated and dodged. Even so, the sword ray still left a sinister gnash on his face, with blood flowing out, making him look sinister.

“Zhuge Qingyun, it has been a long time since we last met.” A voice resounded, and everyone from the Sword Sect quickly turned around because the voice sounded familiar.

When they turned around, they saw a swordsman donned in a blue robe descending from the sky with a faint smile. He looked like a Sword Immortal, and his smile shone like the sun.

“Senior Brother Lin!”

“Flower Burial!”

“Flower Burial has returned!” All the Sword Sect’s disciples became emotional when they saw Lin Yun.

“Junior Brother, you’re finally back! They badly bullied me!” Feng Jue limped over, crying with tears rolling down his cheeks. He was a Quasi-Saint and naturally couldn’t get involved in a battle between Saints. As a result, he could only help from the side. Even so, he was still badly bullied by them.

Most importantly, everyone knew he was a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, and they wanted to humiliate him when they could’ve killed him. Whenever they humiliated him, they would laugh and ask if he was also a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint.

This naturally made Feng Jue feel furious and humiliated, wanting to dig a hole and hide in it. No one present took his life since they wanted to leave him behind to humiliate the Radiant Sword Saint, which everyone laughed along with.

“Who bullied you?” Lin Yun comforted as he stepped forth.

“Him, him, him, all of them! They said I’m not worthy of being the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, and they used me to humiliate our master!” Feng Jue said, pouring out his grievances as he pointed his fingers out.

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that, with a cold light flashing across his eyes. He remembered that their master said that Feng Jue wasn’t stupid or untalented, but his talent would awaken after reaching the Saint Realm. So these people were too much.

“Especially him, Zhuge Qingyun!” Feng Jue pointed at Zhuge Qingyun. He continued, “He told others not to kill me and leave me behind to humiliate our master!”

Lin Yun took a step forward and coldly looked at Zhuge Qingyun.

“Was I wrong?” Zhuge Qingyun sneered.

“Senior Brother Lin, you’re married to the Ninth Princess?” Ye Ziling came forth. She felt this matter was important and had to tell Lin Yun about it.

“How do you know?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“The Ninth Princess is on Scarlet Firmament Peak. She publicly declared that you’re her husband, with everyone hearing it,” Ye Ziling said.

Lin Yun’s face changed, and he turned to Scarlet Firmament Peak with his fist clenched. He knew this, and Su Ziyao chose him over the Divine Dragon Empire, betraying the Empress. This meant that even if they survived this crisis, the Empress wouldn’t let go of her. Despite facing various obstructions, she didn’t hesitate to declare that she was his wife, and she came when her husband was facing trouble.

Lin Yun’s eyes became watery at this moment since he knew he owed her too much.

“Profound Sky Canon, Universal Reversal!” Zhuge Qingyun took this opportunity to launch a sneak attack just when Lin Yun was distracted.

“Senior Brother, watch out!” Mu Qingqing and others exclaimed.

But even without anyone’s call out, Lin Yun had already sensed the danger and a boundless ferocity swept out from him, executing the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique. A dragon’s roar swept out from his body and the Azure Dragon Constellation was attracted to his physique.

When Lin Yun threw his punch, the punch contained the pressure of the Azure Dragon Constellation, shattering the moons. This made Zhuge Qingyun’s face change, and he threw out a mouthful of blood, taking a few steps back.

“Is Tian Xuanzi’s disciple only good at launching sneak attacks and nothing else?” Lin Yun stepped forward, releasing his aura with his cultivation and physique combined, looking like a living azure dragon when he was furious.

“What’s going on?” Zhuge Qingyun wanted to retreat, but he noticed that he couldn’t move under the dragon’s aura. That makes no sense, Lin Yun shouldn’t be able to release such powerful pressure even if he is a Saint Sovereign.

But he didn’t have the luxury to think. Lin Yun’s hand had fallen onto his shoulder with blood splashing out and five holes appearing on his shoulder.

Lin Yun’s fingers were like blades that swiped across his shoulder, revealing his bones.

“You want to leave my senior brother behind to humiliate my master? Sure, as you wish!” A cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes, and he punched Zhuge Qingyun before the latter could even respond.

Zhuge Qingyun was forced to retreat under this attack with his saint origin invaded and shattered. His cultivation soon fell from a Saint Sovereign to a Saint Lord before the Samsara Edict Realm. The moment his Saint Origin was shattered, his dragon pulses and meridians were also destroyed, and this meant that he had become a cripple.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye, and everyone was frightened before they could even respond.

“I’m invincible in the Saint Sovereign Realm!” Lin Yun soared to the sky and joined the fight on Heavenly Prolong Peak, targeting the other Saint Sovereigns and attracting their attention. Relying on the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique, Lin Yun faced multiple Saint Sovereigns and occasionally unleashed several sword rays.

After inflicting heavy injuries on all the Saints, the Saints from the Profound Sky Sect suffered great casualties. He had just returned from the outside world. He met either a God Lord, a God King, or an Ancestral Deity. He was no longer the same person as before, and his foundation was terrifying.

He slaughtered the Saints like they were livestock, and it didn’t take long for the ten-odd Saint Sovereigns to be either heavily injured or dead. This was a brutal scene and all the remaining Saints from the Profound Sky Sect’s faction were terrified and lost their fighting spirits.

When he glanced at them, everyone quickly ran off and didn’t even dare to look at Lin Yun.

“I’ll go to Scarlet Firmament Peak while you clean up the battlefield!” Lin Yun waved his hand at Ye Ziling and others before clasping his hands with three thousand ribbons soaring to the sky and forming into an Azure Dragon.

Lin Yun’s brutality still stumped everyone, and they only came to their senses after seeing him riding on an Azure Dragon.

“We send Flower Burial off!”

““We send Flower Burial off!””

Everyone cupped their fists together. Gongsun Yan and the other saint disciples were excited. This was Flower Burial's grace and the Sword Sect's glory. Everyone yelled as they sent Flower Burial off.

“Hahaha! Flower Burial, you’re finally here! I have waited just to take one last look at you! Now, I can die with no regrets. I’ve fought with Radiant my entire life, and I never regret cultivating my physique or coming here!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint laughed, looking at Lin Yun riding on the azure dragon as he fought six Great Saints.

This made the faces of the six Great Saints change when they heard what he said. If a Great Saint fought them with the thought of dying, at least three to five would have to die, especially when the Dragon Origin Great Saint became a Saint through his physique.

“Old man...” Lin Yun turned back on the Azure Dragon and yelled, “Who’s allowing you to die?! You’re not allowed to die! Catch!”

A golden light shot out from Lin Yun’s hand, and the Dragon Origin Great Saint grabbed onto it. It was naturally the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear. The Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear was the Golden Lotus Flametree, filled with vitality and Buddhist might.

When the Dragon Origin Great Saint held onto the spear, he could sense boundless vitality pouring into his body along with saint energy. He basked in the Buddhist radiance as his body was brimming with vitality, recovering in a split second with his strength greatly boosted.

This surprised the Dragon Origin Great Saint since he had already planned on dying and had accumulated his emotions for a long time. He had already said those words and even got the mood at the right spot, but he didn’t have to die now, which instantly placed him in an awkward position.

When he swung the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear, he easily sent a Great Saint flying away. He roared, “You all dare bully me with numbers? Come and fight your Grandpa Dragon Origin!”

The tables turned for the Dragon Origin Great Saint, which let Lin Yun sigh in relief before his face changed when he raised his head. He saw a massive Golden-Purple Divine Dragon charging towards Su Ziyao under the Light Subduing Great Saint’s control.

“You dare bully my wife?!” Lin Yun roared as he soared to the sky, reaching out and executing the Azure Dragon Grasp. Two divine runes appeared in his palm as a massive dragon claw reached out, grabbing onto the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon.

Su Ziyao turned around and looked at Lin Yun’s gaze, and they both smiled at each other. They were united as husband and wife and would have no regrets even if they died today.
