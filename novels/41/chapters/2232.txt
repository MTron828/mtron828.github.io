Chapter 2233 - Sword Dao!

Despite his sympathy, he still had to upgrade the Flower Burial Sword. Only the Gloryfire, Gloryearth, Glorysun, and Glorymoon Spirits were left. When all seven glory spirits were unlocked, it would become a Sovereign Saint Artifact that solely belonged to him once it resonated with the Heaven Burial Constellation.

Even if other Sovereign Saint Artifacts were powerful, he couldn’t bring out much power as long as they didn’t belong to him. He could not use them to unleash power surpassing Sovereign Saint Artifacts or even reaching Divine Artifact’s height. But it was different if it was a Sovereign Saint Artifact that solely belonged to him.

Strictly speaking, this sword belonged to the Southern Emperor, a sword given to him by his lover. But throughout the journey, he could no longer be separated from the Flower Burial Sword. So after it resonates with the Heaven Burial Constellation, it would be imprinted as his.

“Let’s begin. Don’t waste time,” Lil’ Purple urged. She was also curious about how far the Flower Burial Sword could reach in Lin Yun’s hand.

“Let’s get started, then.” Lin Yun drew out the Flower Burial Sword and Lil’ Purple dripped the Mandala Fragrance onto it. When the Mandala Fragrance entered the Flower Burial Sword, the sword began to revolve and a powerful aura spread throughout the Iris Secret Realm. A dense Mandala Fragrance came from the Flower Burial Sword, and the surroundings looked dreamy.

“The Mandala Fragrance is a treasure, and I have recalled many things.” Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red fell into their memories, but they didn't waste time and took this moment to cultivate.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“The Mandala Fragrance will take some time before it disappears, so take this opportunity and cultivate,” Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded.

When Lin Yun closed his eyes, the floral fragrance enveloped him and he entered a mysterious state. The world was empty, and it felt like he had entered a world fully constructed with saint daos. This was a bizarre feeling since the saint daos were around him like a fog, fluttering up and down.

“Sword Dao!” Lin Yun muttered as all the saint daos except for Sword Dao disappeared. He rejoiced, “The Othershore Flower has such an effect?!”

He could take this opportunity to grasp the Sword Dao, but he felt that something was missing.

Seven days later, Lin Yun’s cultivation reached the pinnacle of the Saint Soul Stage after refining all of the Divine Dragon Saint Liquid.

When he opened his eyes, a dao flower that looked noble and dazzling appeared behind him. This was the Sword Dao that he had been looking forward to.

As Ye Guhan had said, it was just a matter of him before Lin Yun grasped the Sword Dao. But despite looking forward to this day, he was surprisingly calm.

“A person’s heart is profound. If I didn’t grasp it, I would feel anxious despite how composed I am.” Lin Yun waved his sword and the dao flower flew into his hand. He muttered, “Senior Brother doesn’t care about it because he has already grasped it. You would only take it lightly after grasping it.”

The stronger he was, the calmer he would be. Now that he had grasped a Saint Dao, he could easily pierce through dipper aura even if he only used his Astral Sword Intent. The saint dao was a magnifier, and if Lin Yun empowered his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent, it would only become even more powerful.

Even he didn’t know how powerful his sword intent was; this was a true swordsman. So what if he had to face a saint? He could still slaughter them and that included the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord. He could easily take the latter’s life if he ran into the latter again. But it was a pity that he couldn’t.

He didn’t notice that his gaze had become as sharp as a war god’s. It was as though he could pierce through heaven if he wanted to.

“Lin Yun, what are you thinking about? Your gaze is terrifying,” Lil’ Purple spoke out.

“I was just a little emotional.” Lin Yun smiled before changing the topic, “How’s the Flower Burial Sword?”

“Take a look at it yourself.” Lil’ Purple pointed to the sky.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he was surprised because the Flower Burial Sword looked like an ordinary wooden sword. With a wave of his hand, the sword flew over. It looked like a wooden sword, but the weight was immense when he held onto it. He exclaimed, “It’s heavy.”

“Holy shit, it actually knows how to keep a low profile now,” Lin Yun smiled. He knew that the Flower Burial Sword had been successfully upgraded, so he said, “Let’s give it a try, then.”

He wanted to see how powerful his strongest attack was. As he circulated his cultivation techniques, three dao flowers bloomed behind him as his energy began pouring into the sword after being empowered with saint daos. The runes on the Flower Burial Sword began to bloom and the simple-looking sword shone brightly. The three glory spirits were activated in the sword in the next second, followed by the fourth.

“Not enough?” Lin Yun was surprised to discover that the Flower Burial Sword hadn’t reached the limit even after putting all his strength into it. He still hadn’t fully excavated its powers, so he circulated his Azure Dragon Divine Physique, pouring his dragon aura into it. “Why don’t I also try pouring the divine physique into it?”

A terrifying pressure was formed as the sword released a radiance that filled the entire Iris Secret Realm. The Othershore Flower was already trembling and cowered to the ground. Even Lil’ Red was forced to transform into its Ancient Dracoape form.

Lil’ Red slammed its staff against the ground but began retreating. Even the Phoenix Tree was trembling under the pressure, with its branches swaying around.

“S-Stop.” Lil’ Purple called out.

Seeing this, Lin Yun quickly sheathed his sword, and all the commotion settled down.

“You’re too terrifying. I don’t know if it’s because of the Flower Burial Sword, but your gaze has changed earlier,” Lil’ Purple exclaimed.

“That unfathomable?” Lin Yun asked.

“Yeah. I was really afraid that you might tear the Iris Secret Realm apart with your gaze earlier,” Lil’ Purple said, with Lil’ Red nodding as well.

The Othershore Flower also came over, nodding and patting itself with its petal as though it was patting on its chest.

“The Sword Dao, two sword canons, divine physique, and the sword…” Lil’ Purple counted as she continued, “I’ve not yet included the Azure Dragon Sword Heart and Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent. You can imagine how powerful that is.

“What did you experience in the Blood Purgatory Mountain? I feel that you have undergone a thorough transformation, and you’re rapidly growing stronger,” Lil’ Purple asked curiously.

Lin Yun didn’t think much about it and shared his experience on the Blood Purgatory Mountain.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Lil’ Purple was silent for a long time before she said, “How ruthless.”

Lin Yun felt that his current strength should be fine even when facing Kui’erdo in his top condition. He could kill Kui’erdo earlier because the latter was exhausted after trying to ripen the Othershore Flower. But it was different now because he was confident about defeating his opponent even if Kui’erdo was at his prime.

No one would believe that he was still at the Quasi-Saint Realm with his current strength.

“Senior Brother has done what he promised me.” Lin Yun took a deep breath and finally knew how much the training regimen had changed him.

“Time to go out,” Lin Yun said as he left the Iris Secret Realm with Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red. The Othershore Flower also jumped onto Lin Yun’s shoulder. But just when Lin Yun wanted to pat it off his shoulder, the Othershore Flower was already shuttled into his clothes.

“Let it be. If it’s willing to help in the crucial moment, it can be considered a trump card,” Lil’ Purple analyzed. “Even you’re distracted when you hear its song, not to mention others.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered. What Lil’ Purple said did make sense.

“Behave yourself, then,” Lin Yun smiled as he patted the Othershore Flower.

“Yes! I will behave myself!” A crisp voice resounded in Lin Yun’s ears that left him shocked.

The Othershore Flower had awakened its intelligence, so he asked, “When did you gain intelligence?”

“Hehe, when I successfully transformed. Master, don’t talk much, or Lord Phoenix will be suspicious. I can’t let her know that I have awakened my intelligence, or she will try and squeeze me again,” the Othershore Flower’s voice sounded pitiful.

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling because the Othershore Flower wasn’t honest. Lil’ Purple was right.

“Alright, but you don’t have to call me ‘Master’.”

“What am I going to call you if I’m not calling you ‘Master’?”

“You can just follow how Lil’ Purple calls me.”

“Okay, scumbag,” the Othershore Flower said.

Lin Yun was immediately left speechless when he heard that.

“Am I wrong? Lord Phoenix has been calling you that when you’re cultivating, worried about you,” the Othershore Flower said.

Lin Yun couldn’t refute that and said, “As long as you’re happy.”

“Hehe, I am happy, scumbag.”

“Fuck!” Lin Yun didn’t want to talk to the Othershore Flower anymore. When he carried the sword box, he turned around and noticed that the battle between the Asura Dove King and Ying River King had an outcome.

Even if Lin Yun’s strength had undergone a drastic boost, he still had no odds of winning against the Asura Dove King and Ying River King.

He recollected his thoughts and executed his movement technique, heading towards the Blood Flame Plains. While he shuttled through the air, he was too fast and didn’t restrain his sword intent either. So whenever he came across Blood Crows, he didn’t even have to make a move before they were blown into a cloud of blood.

“It has been some time since we met, and your movement technique is really terrifying. What do you think about competing with me?” A voice came from beside Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun turned around, he saw a familiar face: the Asura Dove King. He quickly increased his speed and fled, while the Asura Dove King merely smiled and wasn’t in a hurry to make a move, as if he wanted to compete with Lin Yun in speed.

As the surrounding scenery began to change, the two became so fast that their surroundings began to distort. They had pushed their movement techniques to the limit, and they could sense the existence of space, using it as a bow to increase their speed.

Even when Lin Yun sped up several times, he still couldn’t shake off the Asura Dove King. He then stopped and released a powerful aura that formed into a storm.

“Aren’t you really good at running?” The Asura Dove King coldly smiled as he looked at Lin Yun.

“Even the Ying River King was killed by you, so nothing will change if I run,” Lin Yun replied.

“Good that you know about it. Hand over the Othershore Flower, and I can spare your life,” the Asura Dove King said coldly.

But Lin Yun merely wore a playful expression as he looked at the Asura Dove King and did nothing.
