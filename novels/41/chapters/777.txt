Chapter 778 - Flower Burial Needs Blood To Warm Up

Lin Yun and Qin Yang landed on the stage at the same time as they looked at each other. Everyone could sense the sparks flying from their eyes. The crowd got excited because they could tell that this would be an interesting battle.

Disregarding the grudge that they had, they were both undefeated at this point. Since they had a perfect run, they both had a lot of profound amber aura. So, the one who lost would lose a huge amount of their profound amber aura.

As for their strength, Qin Yang had been a top-tier genius since the previous banquet. No one in the seventh group could prove to be his opponent. In fact, no one was able to last more than ten moves against him. Instead, all of his opponents ended up heavily injured or no longer capable of participating.

As for Lin Yun, he was a brilliant rising star that no one could neglect. He was too mysterious and everyone was shocked when they learned more about him. So far, Lin Yun defeated his opponents easily. However, his victories weren’t truly shocking until he defeated Yan Luoyu with one sword.

Qin Yang narrowed his eyes coldly and smiled, “Lin Yun, your luck has come to an end. Looks like luck is on my side since you’re running into me right before the elimination round. It’s time to end the grudge between us.”

The moment Qin Yang finished speaking, his body blazed with flames that swept over the whole stage, unleashing boundless pressure onto Lin Yun. Clearly, Qin Yang had no intention of holding back.

“What terrifying flames!”

“It’s really different when a genius who has awakened the flame intent.”

“A swordsman’s greatest trump card is his sword intent, but Qin Yang has comprehended the flame intent. Paired with the Profound Yang Art, he should be pretty even with Lin Yun.” Everyone was alarmed by the flames unleashed from Qin Yang because it showed that Qin Yang’s attainment in the Profound Yang Art was high.

“Lin Yun, you’ve offended me time and time again, and I’ve reached the limit of my patience. If you don’t admit defeat, I’ll make you suffer and beg for death!” At this moment, Qin Yang’s eyes flashed coldly with powerful killing intent.

“What powerful killing intent!”

“It looks like Qin Yang is really enraged. But there’s something weird about his killing intent. He must have killed many experts for his killing intent to get so dense.”

“Lin Yun has kicked an iron plate this time around. After all, Qin Yang is even stronger than Yan Luoyu.” Through all of the discussions, no one was optimistic forLin Yun.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun was getting annoyed with Qin Yang. He didn’t want to bother with Qin Yang, but Qin Yang kept coming at him like a fly, which disgusted him. “Yeah, yeah. Words won’t help you get anywhere. Come at me. Let’s end this fight quickly. People like you should wake up from your dreams early on.”

It turned out that Lin Yun wasn’t affected in the slightest by Qin Yang’s words, On the contrary, he was terrifyingly calm. If it was a year ago, he would’ve lost his temper and killed Qin Yang.

But Lin Yun was completely different now as they weren’t on the same level anymore. He was someone who was aiming for the bigger world where Su Ziyao was.

“You! You!!” Qin Yang’s face turned red from anger as Lin Yun’s indifferent tone made him feel inferior. After all, he had never been so underestimated as a top-tier genius.

“You’re courting death!” Qin Yang roared and took a step forward while his flames surged even more violently. Qin Yang’s flames and killing intent clashed with Lin Yun like he was an ant that could easily be crushed.

As Qin Yang continued to approach Lin Yun, his flame aura became even more refined. Lin Yun dares to underestimate me? I’m going to make him pay the price!

Qin Yang laughed as his flame aura boiled along with his origin energy. He continued to walk towards Lin Yun before he suddenly disappeared. When he reappeared, the entire stage was trembling violently. He appeared ten meters away from Lin Yun and threw his palm over, “Blazing Solar Yang!”

At the same time, boundless flames gathered onto his palm. Empowered by his flame intent, the condensed flames crashed towards Lin Yun.

In response, Lin Yun reverse circulated his Iris Sword Sutra and the outline of an Iris Flower appeared behind him. The Iris Flower slowly rotated and a terrifying aura came from Lin Yun as he flicked his finger.

Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword!

Lin Yun’s hands became purple like a jade. When he flicked his finger, a sword ray flew out and shattered Qin Yang’s attack. With an explosion, a terrifying shockwave swept out that sent Qin Yang flying.

“Damn it!” Qin Yang’s face changed. Although he knew he wouldn’t be able to injure Lin Yun heavily, he never expected his attack would get resolved so easily. As his heart began to throb, panic appeared in his pupils. His confidence from before was slowly collapsing. He had to plan well or else he would really lose this battle.

“Time for you to wake up from your dream.” A voice rang out by his ears that sent chills down his spine. Qin Yang narrowed his pupils and saw that Lin Yun was still standing in front of him. But suddenly, Qin Yang felt a lethal threat approaching and his face changed.

“Sacred Profound Yang Seal!” Qin Yang began to form seals with his hands as golden origin energy spread throughout his body. His face was dark because this was a trump card that he planned to save for the ranking round. He most definitely didn’t think that he would have to use it on Lin Yun instead. “Let me see what you’re playing at…”

But before he could even finish, Lin Yun suddenly disappeared and was replaced by a sword ray that expanded in his eyes. Before his golden origin energy could envelop his head, a sword ray flashed. The movement was so fast that all anyone could see was a flying head.

Lin Yun decapitated Qin Yang with one sword. He held onto his Flower Burial Sword while blood dripped down from it.

So what if people humiliate him? He would just kill them. After all, the Flower Burial was cold and it needed blood to warm up.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
