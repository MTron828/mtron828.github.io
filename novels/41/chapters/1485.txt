Chapter 1486 - Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, Lightflow Saint Fruit

The six warships were radiating with a terrifying aura and pressure, causing the thirteen envoys to feel significantly pressured.

“Something’s not right!” Xiao Yun whispered. Lin Yun and the others also felt it. They could sense a boundless killing intent from the warships locked onto them. It was so much so that they could even see the warships' cannons being aimed at them.

“What should we do?” The surrounding atmosphere was too repressive, and this made fear rise in the hearts of Ding Lei, Can Jiu, and others. After all, they didn’t belong to the Heavenly Astral Pavilion, they were merely recruited by An Liuyan for this trial.

They didn’t mind putting their lives on the line in the astral realm. After all, it was possible that this was an opportunity for them. But in the current situation, they might not even be able to enter the astral realm. So they naturally thought about wanting to leave.

On the other hand, Lin Yun was calm and felt safe. The six demonic sects clearly wanted to use them as hostages to force the elders of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion to appear. After all, not everyone had the Profound Saint Yin Eyes to find the coordinates of the astral realm.

While everyone was feeling uncertain, seven figures suddenly appeared like meteorites, streaking across the horizon. They were the seven Samsara Edict Realm experts that should be guarding the nebula.

“Hehe. Old Feng, you hid deep enough this time!” A man on the warship belonging to the Netherworld Hall grinned.

“You guys actually want to monopolize this undeveloped astral realm? You guys are really bold!” A middle-aged woman eerily smiled from the Hundred Ghost Gate’s warship.

The leader of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion’s party was Feng Zhengyao, the head of the seven guardians beneath the pavilion master. There were no saints around because it would be too peculiar if a saint appeared in the seventh-layer of heaven. At that time, even a fool would know there was a problem.

But Feng Zhengyao didn’t expect that despite their secrecy, the news of the astral realm was still exposed.

“Release my people first!” Feng Zhengyao said, suppressing his anger.

“Hehe. Why don’t you come over first?” The man on the Netherworld Hall’s warship raised his brow.

“Grand Guardian, be careful.” The other guardians’ faces changed because they had no idea what these people were trying to do.

But Feng Zhengyang didn’t hesitate and appeared on the Netherworld Hall’s warship by taking a step forth. Shortly after, a figure flew out from the other warships and appeared on Netherworld Hall’s warship. The pressure on Lin Yun and the others was instantly alleviated in the next second.

The thirteen envoys and the experts they brought along immediately came behind the other guardians.

“You guys back down, first.” A guardian gave them an order. They didn’t know how the talk would turn out. If the negotiations fail, then the trial would definitely be affected.

Lin Yun and his group landed on a meteorite with a flicker, and their expressions were more relaxed. Ding Lei, Can Jiu, and the others had gathered together, discussing the situation amongst themselves. On the other hand, Lin Yun was pretty composed because he knew that the Heavenly Astral Pavilion would compromise, and there was a high possibility that the trial would be postponed. But he had no idea if they would be allowed into the astral realm.

An Liuyan’s face changed while occasionally sending uneasy looks at the six warships.

“Don’t worry about it. It might not be a piece of bad news for you.” Lin Yun said.

But his words made An Liuyan smile bitterly, “This is too abrupt, but it seems normal simultaneously. No matter what, I will do my best to let you enter the astral realm. After all, I gave you my promise.”

Lin Yun nodded his head and didn’t say a word. An Liuyan’s face changed as she received a voice transmission. “The thirteen envoys have been summoned. There’s probably an outcome. I’ll be back shortly.”

“Go on.” Lin Yun glanced and saw that Feng Zhengyao had left the Netherworld Hall’s warship, and the thirteen envoys were gathering towards him. He was surprised by how efficient they were, making him curious about what the outcome would be.

An Liuyan quickly returned. When she arrived, Can Jiu and the rest all stepped forth, “What’s the result?”

“The trial has been canceled. The seven sects have come to the decision that they will join hands to explore this astral realm. After all, Guardian Feng can’t bear the pressure of the other six demonic forces joining hands together.” An Liuyan sighed.

“What about us?” Can Jiu and the rest were more concerned about them.

“This is a lesser astral realm, and Dragon Pulse Realm experts can’t enter. So only those at the Elysium Core Realm can enter, and you guys will definitely be used. But you guys will have to hand over half of your gains in the astral realm to us. The other demonic sects also invited external help, and the rules are the same for them as well.” An Liuyan said.

This also meant no bargaining, since the seven demonic sects had unanimously decided. Since Dragon Pulse Realm experts couldn’t enter the lesser astral realm, it would definitely be dangerous for ordinary Elysium Core Realm experts. This was where the value of Can Jiu and the others came in.

The other demonic sects also invited top-tiered Elysium Core Realm experts. After all, six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm disciples were rare, even in the seven demonic sects.

“We have to put our lives at risk and hand over half of our harvest? Isn’t it the same as becoming a coolie for your Heavenly Astral Pavilion?” Can Jiu unhappily furrowed his brows.

Lin Yun also didn’t say anything because this condition was really harsh. After all, with the trial canceled, their value to the envoys naturally fell, and they couldn’t fulfill their promises.

“I may not have made it clear earlier. The harvest you guys will hand over isn’t to the Heavenly Astral Pavilion or me but the seven demonic sects.” An Liuyan explained. When she said that, everyone fell silent. Several people hesitated, but they ultimately agreed in the end.

Even if they were unhappy, they couldn't refuse such an opportunity. Lin Yun didn’t say a word, nor did he refuse. As far as he was concerned, his main priority was to obtain a Divine Dragon Bone in the astral realm. He wouldn’t mind handing over half of his harvest as long as they didn’t touch his Divine Dragon Bone at that time.

An hour later, the elders of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion recalled the array concealing the astral realm, revealing the ancient nebula before everyone. This caused an uproar amongst the seven demonic forces, and everyone’s attention was on the nebula.

“It’s really an undiscovered astral realm!”

“This astral realm isn’t simple, and the saint aura is denser than I’ve imagined. I’m afraid there will be many saint fruits found there!”

“Who knows? There might even be inheritances from the previous era.”

“The astral realm actually has the lingering aura of the dragon clan. This is rare, and I’m afraid this is a huge opportunity.”

“How did the Heavenly Astral Pavilion find this astral realm? They’re really lucky.” After seeing the astral realm, the elites from the various demonic sects were stumped. In the next second, countless people flew out from the six warships.

Taking a look at them, Lin Yun roughly estimated that there were at least thousands of people who were recruited by the seven demonic sects.

“Let’s go. We need to enter as well.” An Liuyan said, and everyone else entered the nebula vortex. It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to be the only one left behind. An Liuyan and Elder Chen were still around, but everyone else had already left.

“Elder Chen, you can enter first.” An Liuyan said. When Elder Chen nodded in acknowledgment, he left by himself.

“You want to travel with me?” Lin Yun asked.

“What’s the matter? You don’t want to?” An Liuyan smiled.

“I don’t mean it that way.”

“Let’s go, then.” The two followed behind the crowd and entered the vortex, passing through a light screen. When they passed through the light screen, they could sense an ancient aura flowing at them, and it felt like they had traveled back in time to the previous era.

A long time later, a massive mountain appeared before them, and the grandeur of this mountain couldn’t be simply described with words. More accurately speaking, this was a huge island in the form of a mountain, and that mountain was the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.

Several forked roads appeared before them when they descended, leading to four directions of the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. They two picked a random path. As they continued forth, they couldn’t see anything else aside from the heavy fog in the surroundings.

They didn’t know how long they had been walking. But when the fog cleared up, a gigantic tree appeared before them. The tree was covered with black leaves that shone with a faint light. Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, and he said, “These leaves can be used to brew tea. It looks like this tree has undergone reincarnation for tens of thousands of years.”

“It’s effective for ordinary geniuses but useless for monstrous geniuses like us. At best, it can only be sold for hundreds of thousands of divine astral pellets.” An Liuyan was experienced with all sorts of treasures, and she could even evaluate the rough price of an item.

Lin Yun was dumbfounded when he heard that. He nearly forgot how wealthy An Liuyan was. As they walked, their vision gradually opened up, revealing an ancient ruin. They could see collapsed palaces and ruins that were left behind. The ground was burned by flames, leaving only ashes covering the ground.

Lin Yun bent down and grabbed a handful of soil. He could see sparks in the soil, and the sparks contained a noble aura.

“What kind of flames raged here?” Lin Yun said in a melancholic tone.

“I heard that it’s the Flames of False Gods. After the deities died, the flames could no longer be maintained and raged through everything, ending the entire era. Then again, it’s just a speculation. After all, it took place in the previous era.” An Liuyan said calmly.

As they continued forth, they soon ran into other people. There were dozens of people gathered under a towering tree, and this tree was different from what they had seen previously. This was a saint tree that was bearing fruit, and the fruit was naturally saint fruit.

There were over a hundred saint fruits, each of which was extremely attractive. Just the aura and fragrance alone felt comfortable after only taking in a breath.

“Lightflow Saint Fruit!” An Liuyan rejoiced.

Lin Yun never heard about it before, but he could tell from An Liuyan’s tone that it wasn’t ordinary.
