Chapter 1902 - Holy Maiden's Questioning

“Ranking battle?” Lin Yun was baffled because this was the first time he heard of it.

Chen Feng wasn’t surprised by Ye Qingtian’s response. He smiled and said, “The ranking battle is held twice a year. The first time is only for inner disciples, and the second is for saint disciples. There are a lot of rewards in the first ranking battle amongst inner disciples, but they’re nothing compared to the second. In the past, Senior Brother could only observe, but you can now participate in it.”

“Oh? Go into the details,” Lin Yun replied.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Okay.” Chen Feng explained, “The ranking battle for saint disciples will be differentiated into four groups, Tian, Di, Xuan, and Huang. The limit for Huang is disciples at the pinnacle of the Profound Death Stage, the limit for Xuan is disciples at the second transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and the limit for Di is the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. As for Tian, the threshold is the Nirvana Stage, and there are no limits. They’re usually meant for the saint's disciples, and the tensity is also the highest.”

Lin Yun found it weird for the ranking battle to be separated into groups, but he soon figured it out. After all, the Heavenly Dao Sect would have two to three hundred saint disciples every year, and who knew how many saint disciples there would be after so many years? Some saint disciples were in their fifties or seventies. As long as they were within the age of a hundred, they could still retain their identity as saint disciples.

After reaching the Nirvana Stage, everyone’s lifespan would increase, and they still had more potential to be excavated even if they were a hundred years old. After all, a Nirvana Stage expert and a Dragon Pulse Realm expert who were a hundred years old were of two different concepts.

Those at the Nirvana Stage had more lifespan, and they still had the chance to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm. The moment they reach the Quasi-Saint Realm, everything changes. This was why the ranking battle amongst saint disciples had to be differentiated. Otherwise, those younger saint disciples would suffer when fighting older saint disciples.

“The top ten in Huang can receive ten thousand Nirvana Pellets and ten thousand contribution points.”

“The top ten in Xuan can receive fifty thousand Nirvana Pellets and fifty thousand contribution points.”

“The top ten in Di can receive a hundred thousand Nirvana Pellets and a hundred thousand contribution points.”

“The top ten in Tian can receive a Quasi-Saint Pellet and two hundred thousand contribution points.”

“Contribution points can be used to exchange for resources, saint artifacts, secret techniques, cultivation techniques, True Dragon Saint Liquid, Nirvana Pellets, Quasi-Saint Pellets, and even Saint Dragon Pellets…” Chen Feng introduced.

These were only the rewards for those in the top ten. As for the champion, the rewards were terrifying, even for those in the Huang group.

“Senior Brother can try and make it into the top ten in the Xuan group!” Chen Feng said, looking at Lin Yun. “You have high hopes!”

Lin Yun merely replied with a smile. In the eyes of others, he might only be at the third channel of the Profound Death Stage. So no one was optimistic about him making it into the top ten in the Xuan group. So Chen Feng’s words were no different from comforting him.

“When will the ranking battle start?” Lin Yun asked.

“Roughly about two months from now,” Chen Feng said.

The Heavenly Dao Sect was the strongest of Eastern Desolation’s six holy lands, and they would have disciples being promoted to saint disciples annually. Year after year, many experts would be accumulated amongst saint disciples, and many of the saint disciples’ strength reached an unimaginable height.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that there were countless geniuses. Lin Yun was only at the third channel of the Profound Death Stage and was insignificant amongst the saint disciples. After all, the saint disciples in seclusion and those outside would return for the ranking battle because the rewards were too ample.

No one would miss the ranking battle if they didn’t have any particular reason. After all, it allowed them to become famous within the sect. Right then, a figure flew out from the Celestial Purging Mountain. This was a figure donned in a purple robe with lightning enveloping him. He looked to be in his thirties and was hovering in the air, looking down.

“Ouyang He is back!”

“What powerful lightning! It looks like he’s not planning to miss the ranking battle this year after three years.”

“His cultivation has become deep and unfathomable. It looks like he’s planning to use this ranking battle to become famous!”

When Ouyang He appeared, countless saint disciples, including Lin Yun, turned to look at him. This person didn’t use any dragon origin and merely relied on lightning to fly. This meant his Lightning Intent should be at the fifth grade. Now, this was the key point, but this person’s attainment in lightning had reached an incredible height.

Lin Yun also grasped the Thunderstorm Intent and knew how to manipulate lightning. But Lightning Intent differed amongst people.

“Who is this person? His Lightning Intent is really strong!” Lin Yun asked.

“Senior Brother, he’s the saint’s disciple of the Heavenly Yin Palace, Ouyang He. He was ranked third on the Dragon Pulse Ranking two decades ago, and I wasn’t even an inner disciple back then when he became a saint disciple. Two decades have passed, and I can’t see through his cultivation,” Chen Feng said with a grave expression.

“Fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage,” Lin Yun said.

“He’s strong, but it won’t be easy for him to make it into the top ten on the Tian group. The Tian group has no limits, and many older disciples have reached a terrifying height,” Chen Feng explained.

“If he’s not going to the Tian group, what about the Di group?” Lin Yun asked.

“He can easily obtain the top three at the very least, or even first!” Chen Feng said in a confident tone.

“First? The top three might be possible. But he can give up on becoming first,” Lin Yun said.

Chen Feng scratched his head and felt what Ye Qingtian said was weird. But he didn’t know what was strange about it. A brief moment later, he said, “Senior Brother, you’re talking about the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden? There’s that possibility. If she’s still at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, she’ll definitely become first.”

Lin Yun was surprised when he heard that and asked, “The Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden is only at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage?”

Three beauties in the Heavenly Dao Sect, each possessing a unique temperament. They were the goddesses of all disciples within the Heavenly Dao Sect. Lin Yun had seen this Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden at the conferring ceremony before, but he didn’t have much impression of her.

“Senior Brother, you don’t remember that? The Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden is a genius; her cultivation is already high and she’s only nineteen this year!” Chen Feng said in an excited voice, and anyone could tell that he was fond of this Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden.

“Senior Brother, Chen Jun is also here,” Chen Feng said, looking at Chen Jun with a playful gaze. Chen Jun often bullied those from the Indigo Thunder Peak, but Ye Qingtian defeated Chen Jun at the conferring ceremony.

Chen Jun initially thought that he could suppress Ye Qingtian after obtaining the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, but he was easily defeated by Ye Qingtian instead. He was greatly humiliated at the conferring ceremony.

Lin Yun had long discovered Chen Jun’s presence but wasn’t too bothered. His gaze fell onto a person beside Chen Jun, who looked to be in his mid-twenties. But the reason why he was surprised was that he shared an uncanny resemblance with Ye Qingtian.

That person also sensed Lin Yun’s gaze and raised his head to look over.

“That person is also out?!” Chen Feng’s face changed.

“Who is he?”

“Senior Brother, that’s Ye Feifan. He became a saint’s disciple two years ago, a monstrous genius of the Ye Clan. That means he’s also your fellow clansman. His cultivation is at the third transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and it is said he had once defeated an opponent at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage!” Chen Feng suppressed his voice.

Ye Feifan often taught Ye Qingtian a lesson in the past, and he didn’t consider Ye Qingtian as a fellow clansman. Every three transformations of the Nirvana Stage was a threshold; making it through each threshold would significantly strengthen their nirvana aura. The physique would also transform the temperment of the nirvana aura. So it was impressive that Ye Feifan could defeat an opponent at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

“Ye Qingtian, you don’t even fear Zhang Yue. Don’t tell me that you don’t place this fellow clansman of yours in your eyes now?” A crisp voice resounded.

When Lin Yun raised his head, the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden, Bai Shuying, spoke. He smiled, “Senior Sister Bai has misunderstood me. I have always been humble. So how will I look down on anyone?”

“Humble?” Bai Shuying sneered. “No one is more shameless than you within the Heavenly Dao Sect. I witnessed how arrogant you were two days ago!”

She was ten-odd steps away from Lin Yun. She was donning a white robe, a purple belt coiling around her waist, and a blue cloth around her head. She looked more elegant than usual, and her clothes couldn’t conceal her elegant temperament.

The moment she appeared, she instantly became the center of attention. Even Chen Feng was anxious that Bai Shuying spoke to Ye Qingtian. Can it be that Senior Brother has subdued her? Isn’t that a little too insane?

Chen Feng couldn’t help becoming excited upon thinking about it. If Ye Qingtian really subdued the latter, it would be a huge matter, and who knows how many disciples would be heartbroken by this.

On the other hand, Lin Yun could sense Bai Shuying’s murderous intent. Her murderous intent was even more potent than Zhang Yue’s, and she could make a move at any time. He calmed himself down and smiled, “As a righteous person, I naturally have to teach a lecher like Zhang Yue a lesson. So how can you say that I’m arrogant? Not to mention he even slandered Senior Sister Bai. So it’s understandable that I was a little heavy with my hands.”

His words instantly caused an uproar within the surroundings, and everyone sent furious looks at Lin Yun. Since when did Ye Qingtian possess the qualification to call others lechers? Just how shameless could he be?

Bai Shuying had no expression and asked, “Does that mean I have to thank you instead?”

“No need. The sun and moon can prove my feelings for you,” Lin Yun smiled.

Hearing that, the murderous intent within Bai Shuying’s pupils grew stronger. She asked, “Ye Qingtian, let me ask you this. Are you the mastermind behind what happened to Zhang Yue?”

Lin Yun’s heart froze, and he had already expected this. After all, Bai Shuying flared up when Zhang Yue spoke her name two days ago.

But Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling guilty because he knew he couldn’t admit it now. Thus, he could only toughen his scalp and sighed, “My heart towards you can be proven by the sun and moon. What do you want me to do to prove my feelings for you? How will I use your reputation to do something so despicable? If I did it, Ye Qingtian would be struck by lightning and be affected by my heart demon when making a breakthrough to the Nirvana Stage.”

This was a solemn oath, but he, Lin Yun, did it and had nothing to do with Ye Qingtian.

But after hearing what Lin Yun said, Bai Shuying couldn’t help becoming suspicious with her pupils flickering.
