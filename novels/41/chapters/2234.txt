Chapter 2235 - My Name! (1)

Lin Yun stood in the air with the Flower Burial Sword hovering beside him.

It didn’t take long for the Asura Dove King to appear before him, heavily injured with Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red behind him, blocking his path of retreat.

“I knew you’d be back,” Lin Yun looked down at the Asura Dove King without emotion.

The Asura Dove King felt aggrieved, frightened, and angry. He was so weak now that even an ordinary Blood Crow could claim his life.

When he looked at Lin Yun, he maintained his dignity as a king with boundless murderous intent blazing in his eyes. He was the Asura Dove King, an infamous figure in the Heavenly Void who got his current reputation by killing with the Rahu Sword. Since when had he suffer such grievance?

His opponent was a Quasi-Saint, which made him clench his fist by just thinking about it. But this state didn’t last long before he began to wail as Lil’ Red became furious after seeing that the Asura Dove King didn’t behave like a captive.

“What are you looking at? Didn’t you hear my big brother asking you something?

“Why did you clench your fist together? You want to beat up my big brother?

“See how I’ll teach you a lesson first!” Lil’ Red was furious as it swung its punches on the Asura Dove King, making the latter wail out in pain as he ran around. He no longer had his demeanor as a king and could only keep begging for mercy.

“Lord Cat, stop!

“I’m wrong! I was wrong!” The Asura Dove King was beaten to the point that he cried, not only because of the pain but also his dignity. He would’ve never expected that he would be beaten to such a pathetic state by a cat.

After he behaved himself, Lin Yun said again, “It’s time for you to speak.”

The Asura Dove King coughed out a mouthful of blood and said, “Since you spared my life, you must want something from me.”

“That’s smart of you. I have two questions. If you can satisfy me with your answer, I might be willing to tell you something interesting,” Lin Yun landed on the ground as he spoke, standing before the Asura Dove King.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The Asura Dove King threw out a mouthful of blood and smiled sinisterly, “Do you think I don’t know the means of human cultivators like you? The moment I answer your questions, I will be killed. You can humiliate or kill me, but don’t even think about getting a piece of information from me!”

Hearing his reply, Lil’ Red wanted to step forth and give him another beating, which made the Asura Dove King feel a hint of fear, but there was also a hint of stubbornness in his eyes. He had already decided that he wouldn’t cooperate with Lin Yun.

Lin Yun stopped Lil’ Red, which made the latter stretch its claws and ferociously said, “Big Brother, this fellow needs a few more beatings. After I’m done with him, I guarantee he’ll say everything.”

“Let’s just kill him. Keeping him around will only be a disaster,” Lil’ Purple said as she noticed the hatred in the Asura Dove King’s eyes.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word as he stepped forth, and the Asura Dove King fearfully took a few steps back.

But before the Asura Dove King could back off, Lin Yun had already stepped forth and grabbed onto the Asura Dove King's shoulder.

The Asura Dove King wanted to scream out by instinct, but he was surprised to discover that Lin Yun had used some kind of energy to treat his injuries. This energy was miraculous, and the Asura Dove King was shocked to discover that many of his superficial wounds had healed. Even his broken arm was healed, along with many injuries on the surface.

A brief moment later, a new arm grew out, and there wasn’t any discomfort in this new arm when the Asura Dove King clenched his fist. The Asura Dove King was placed in an awkward position because he wanted to scream out. But all the pain in his body had disappeared along with the wounds, replaced by a warm current.

“If you think I’ll submit from such a small favor, you have looked down on me!” After Lin Yun stopped, the Asura Dove King lowered his head to check himself and began to accumulate his strength, wanting to capture Lin Yun.

“This isn’t a favor,” Lin Yun said as he turned around.

“Ha, I have seen countless tricks before. So, do you think that I’ll fall for it?” As the Asura Dove King played along with Lin Yun, pretending to examine his injuries with a ferocity flashing in his eyes.

When Lin Yun turned around, the Asura Dove King raised his head with a crimson radiance shining in his eyes, and he used his fingers as a sword, thrusting towards Lin Yun’s chest. He was confident he could tear Lin Yun’s heart apart at such a close distance.

But the moment he circulated his saint energy, the Asura Dove King threw out a mouthful of blood with radiant pain, making his facial expression distorted. He fell onto the ground with one knee, and his hand that he had reached out fell onto the ground to support himself.

Lin Yun took a few steps back, sat on a boulder, and said, “You’re at least a king. Do you have to kneel to me?”

The Asura Dove King’s face changed because he had no idea what happened earlier. But when he examined his body, he was shocked to discover a powerful sword intent lingering within his body.

This sword intent was so powerful that it had infiltrated his meridians and internal organs. It was fine if he didn’t circulate his saint energy. But if he did, that sword intent would become even tougher than a bladed saint artifact that would pierce his internal organs and meridians.

“The azure dragon aura is effective against injuries, but not the Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent. Not to mention that my sword intent is further empowered with saint dao. Even I would have trouble getting rid of it for you, so I suggest you not circulate your saint energy for some time,” Lin Yun said calmly, as if he didn’t know what the Asura Dove King was trying to do earlier. He continued, “Speaking of which, you’re also a swordsman. So you should know about it well.”

The Asura Dove King awkwardly smiled, before he stood up, “I was reckless, and I won’t circulate my saint energy before I recover from my injuries.”

He was shameless and brushed it off since Lin Yun didn’t pursue it.

Lin Yun didn’t expose him, but asked, “Do you know the Blood Flame Plains? Is there a Divine Blood Fruit there?”

The Blood Flame Plans? The Asura Dove King’s eyes flashed with fear upon hearing that. Then he said, “There’s a rumor like that, but that is the territory of the Blood Flame King, and no one dares to challenge him.”

“How high is the Blood Flame King’s strength?” Lin Yun asked.

The Asura Dove King smiled, “Don’t even think about it. With your current strength, he can easily crush you with one finger. Before discussing that, you should go back and cultivate for another hundred years.”

He might be stopping Lin Yun from going, but he was triggering Lin Yun on purpose. After all, the more someone said that you couldn’t do something, the more you would want to prove to them that you could.

Asura Dove King was plotting for Lin Yun to die in the Blood Flame Plains. He observed Lin Yun’s expression, wanting to find something unusual on his face, only to be disappointed.

Lin Yun was calm as he sat on the boulder. This only made the Asura Dove King feel even more terrified since Lin Yun looked like a Sword Immortal, donning his azure robes and a faint radiance shining down on him. This gave the Asura Dove King a feeling that Lin Yun was deep and unfathomable, and he couldn’t look down on Lin Yun because of his cultivation.

“How much do you know of the Demonspirit Clan?” Lin Yun asked.

The Asura Dove King’s eyes flickered, but he didn’t reply. His instincts told him that this piece of information was valuable.

“You want this, right?” Lin Yun took out the Othershore Flower from his clothes. After transforming, the Othershore Flower gave off a bewitching radiance in Lin Yun’s palm. The radiance looked dreamy, making Lin Yun’s face look distorted.

“H-How is this possible!” The Asura Dove King exclaimed as he stood up, looking at the Othershore Flower. The Othershore Flower had transformed. In the past, the Othershore Flower was only a seed. Not only was it ripened, it had even undergone an unimaginable transformation.

“That’s the Mandala Fragrance…” The Asura Dove King’s facial expression became manic as he came over. But he soon clutched his head as he screamed out in pain. This was because Lil’ Red had given him a knock on his head with the staff, seeing that he wanted to step forth.

“Behave yourself!” Lil’ Red said ferociously.

When the Asura Dove King finally contained his emotions, his gaze fell onto the Othershore Flower with greed that couldn’t be concealed. He said, “Over the past thousands of years, the Demonspirit Clan has been performing a transaction with us. They would provide us with cultivating resources while we provide them with corpses. It wasn’t convenient for them to come here in the past, but our transactions became more frequent after the restrictions loosened up. Furthermore, the resources they provided were terrifying, and they could even offer divine blood. Then again, the transactions also depended on strength. Those stronger than them would naturally snatch their resources by force since those people aren’t good either way.”

The Asura Dove King also didn’t say that the Blood Crows have often done this dirty work.

“Over the past thousand years?” Lin Yun asked in doubt. “Do you guys have that many corpses for them?”

“You don’t think that there’s only the Heavenly Void beneath the God Burial Mountain Range, right?” The Asura Dove King sneered.
