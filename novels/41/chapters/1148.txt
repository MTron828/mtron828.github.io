Chapter 1149 - Desperate Straits

Under the metallic collision’s sound, the massive crimson dragon flew into the horizon and entered the clouds.

“Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal…” Lin Yun’s expression became grave when he saw this scene.

Right now, the crimson light from the dragon dyed the surrounding sky red. It was akin to a beacon that lured over the demonic cultivators.

So the joy on the faces of Liu Yuan and the rest was quickly replaced with anxiety. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The ground began to tremble violently as cracks full of light spread out along the ground. Then, the temperature in the surrounding atmosphere began to increase violently while an ancient aura seeped out.

“Senior Sister, that’s the origin stone of the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal, right?” Feng Zhang’s body began to tremble uneasily.

Lin Yun appeared beside Ye Ziling and said, “The appearance of the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal is earlier than expected.”

Everyone’s face sank when they heard that because this meant that the experts of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect wouldn’t make it in time.

“Unless… the sect master interferes… it will still take another half day for the elders to arrive,” said Ye Ziling.

Upon hearing that, Liu Yuan’s eyes lit up, “So we just have to defend this area for half a day? We can send a signal to the elders at the campsite.”

The moment he finished, a green firework blew up in the sky above the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s camp at the Heavenly Aquatic Island.

“The camp is being assaulted!” Liu Yuan’s face became ugly because he had high hopes for the two Elysium Core Realm elders at the camp. It seemed like the enemies were starting their ambush.

“As expected,” said Ye Ziling without any change on her face.

At the same time, Lin Yun could sense that enemies with baleful aura were coming towards them. Then, Liu Yuan turned around and spotted a familiar blue-clothed figure, “Qin Feng!”

“Qin Feng by himself is nothing. As long as that monster from the Profound Wither Sea isn’t here, we’ll be fine,” said Ye Ziling without much change on her face.

“Who is the number one ranked person?” Lin Yun asked with his brows locked together. Ye Ziling avoided the topic earlier, so Lin Yun knew that she was scared.

“His name is Lei Ying, an abandoned disciple of a powerful demonic sect. He’s proficient in lightning and flame intent, and his cultivation should be at the quasi-Elysium Core Realm…” Ye Ziling replied.

“Quasi-Elysium Core Realm.” Lin Yun squinted his eyes because it was a little too strong.

“Elysium Core Realm demonic cultivators are too dangerous, and the four sects have a secret agreement to work together if an Elysium Core Realm demonic cultivator appears in the Profound Wither Sea. But Lei Ying is only in the quasi-Elysium Core Realm… and his terrifying reputation makes the demonic cultivators of the Profound Wither Sea will heed his orders,” explained Liu Yuan with a grave expression. “Lei Ying has always been a cautious person and tries not to make any trouble for the four major sects. So the sects turned a blind eye to his existence in the Profound Wither Sea. But he’s really behind this, there’s no way he will let go of the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal!”

The truth of the matter was that Lei Ying didn’t cause trouble because the four major sects didn’t have anything that caught his attention. But the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal was worthy of grabbing his attention.

“He might not be near Heavenly Aquatic Island…” Feng Zhang and the other core disciples said.

“Who else aside from him can command so many demonic cultivators to attack our sect’s campsite?” Ye Ziling asked. Her question instantly stumped everyone.

While everyone was thinking, the cracks in the ground finally exploded. Countless rocks were sent flying as a cloud of dust appeared. Then, a fist-sized metal gemstone flew out.

The gemstone was smooth and looked like a blood jade. It also had a delicate look like a fruit that would break with a single bite. Lin Yun could sense a terrifying aura when he locked onto the gemstone. Although it wasn’t large, he knew that it would be incredibly heavy. I wonder how powerful it could make a saint artifact…

Lin Yun could sense his heart beat wildly as the Azure Dragon Saint Art began to circulate in his body. An unquenchable thirst appeared in the depth of his heart as the Azure Dragon Saint Art desired to devour the gemstone. However, Lin Yun forcibly suppressed the feeling. Why is the Azure Dragon Saint Art attracted to that gemstone?

Suddenly, a thought flashed in Lin Yun’s mind as he figured out what was going on. The Azure Dragon Saint Art wanted the dragon’s blood. Can it help me reach the sixth stage?

Was this the opportunity Lin Yun needed to achieve the Azure Dragon Saint Physique? Logically speaking, he should have reached the sixth stage with all the True Dragon Saint Liquid he refined. But he was stuck in a bottleneck no matter how he tried.

Ye Ziling suddenly waved her hand and pierced through the crimson screen to grab the gemstone. But the moment she grabbed hold of it, her face changed, “Ninth-grade saint rune!”

Who would have thought that the saint rune on the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal’s origin stone would be at the ninth-grade? Everyone was dumbfounded by Ye Ziling’s words. Saint runes were differentiated into nine grades, and then they would reach divine rune status.

However, divine runes were only seen in legends. So the ninth-grade saint rune was the highest grade in Kunlun Realm.

It didn’t take long for Ye Ziling to wear a burdened expression as she turned to look at Lin Yun, “It’s too heavy. Lin Yun, you’ve cultivated a body-refining martial technique, right?”

After Lin Yun nodded his head, Ye Ziling handed the origin stone to Lin Yun without any hesitation and said, “Then you take it.”

Then, she transmitted her voice to Lin Yun, “The value of this origin stone is unimaginable. Even if… Even if we all die, you have to take this back to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect no matter what!”

When Lin Yun held onto the origin stone, he nearly fell onto the ground. It wasn’t because the origin stone was too heavy, but Ye Ziling’s words had shocked him. After all, she made it sound like Lei Ying would kill all of them.

Lin Yun quickly recovered from his shock and circulated his vitality to stabilize himself. He made several attempts, but he couldn’t keep the origin stone in his interspatial pouch, so he had to put it in his sword box.

When he placed the origin stone in the sword box, his face sank because his footing became even more unstable. The origin stone seemed to have a weak intelligence as it struggled to exit the sword box. It even increased how much it weighed, which made Lin Yun feel like he was carrying a mountain.

Naturally, Lin Yun couldn’t get beat by a rock, so he gritted his teeth and circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art. Immediately, purple-golden runes appeared on the surface of his body as he controlled the origin stone inside the sword box to regain his footing.

“Hahaha! Ye Ziling, we meet again!” A burst of laughter sounded out as ten figures appeared in front of Ye Ziling’s party. Qin Feng stood in the front with two people next to him that were in the Astral Stage, which was the same level as the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s deacon.

There were also a few others who rushed over after seeing the phenomenon on the island. After all, even a fool could tell that a treasure was being born. The incoming demonic cultivators gave Ye Ziling a headache because Liu Yuan was the only one who had reached the Astral Stage.

Ye Ziling’s sky sword intent was at greater mastery, so most Astral Stage experts weren’t her opponent. However, QIn Feng was ranked tenth in the Profound Wither Sea, which would give her a hard time.

“Why is Lei Ying still hiding?” Ye Ziling probed after seeing that Lei Ying was nowhere to be seen. She was secretly hoping that Lei Ying had gone to the campsite because it would decrease the burden she was feeling.

Qin Feng seemed to know what she was thinking and grinned, “Boss Lei isn’t needed to deal with you. Ye Ziling, you think too highly of yourself. Hahaha!”

Hearing his words, the other demonic cultivators began to laugh as they started examining Ye Ziling. When an old man looked at Wang Yuruo, his eyes instantly lit up, “This lass isn’t bad. She looks really tender!”

Wang Yuruo had never seen such a huge formation before, so her body was trembling and her face was pale. Lin Yun stood next to her and started comforting her when he saw her current state. “Relax. Don’t be afraid.”

“Ye Ziling, hand over the origin stone! You’re not the only ones who know about the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal. If you don’t hand it over, we’ll slaughter everyone on the island!” yelled Qin Feng.

Qin Feng was only paying attention to Ye Ziling and Lei Yuan right now. He was confident that he could hold Ye Ziling back, and that the two Astral Stage experts he was with could handle Liu Yuan. So it would be easy to deal with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party.

As the ten demonic cultivators spread out and surrounded the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party, they sealed off all paths of retreat. When Lin Yun looked at Qin Feng and the two other Astral Stages, he knew why Ye Ziling wasn’t optimistic about their situation. Plus, things would be even worse if Lei Ying showed up.

If Lei Ying really showed up, there was no way they would make it out of this alive!
