Chapter 1448 - Envy (2)

“You can’t stop making others from worrying about you. You must have tormented Fifth Junior Brother in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.” Mu Chuan sighed.

“Hey, I’m innocent. His temper is even fouler than mine. I’m the one who was being tormented by him, not the other way around.” Lin Yun smiled.

Mu Chuan laughed when he heard that. He obviously knew that Jian Jingtian had a foul temper.

“How is he? I heard that he reached the Samsara Edict Realm?” Mu Chuan asked.

“Well, he became a king immediately after making a breakthrough when he undid the knot in his heart.” Lin Yun replied. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Mu Chuan’s gaze became complicated when he heard that; his gaze was filled with nostalgia and emotions. But he had more pity in his gaze as he said, “I knew that he’d be able to come out of it. But… don’t learn from him.”

“What did he do?” Lin Yun hurriedly asked.

But Lin Yun’s question only made Mu Chuan vigilant as he looked at Lin Yun. “It’s not a taboo, but you’ll know about it sooner or later. So don’t ask me about it and head to the Great Profound Palace.”

“Great Profound Palace?” Lin Yun was surprised to hear the name of that palace. “It’s related to the Great Profound Sword Canon?”

“You’ll know when you’re there. Let Chen Ling bring you over.” Mu Chuan said before he disappeared.

“Let’s go. I’ll take you to the Great Profound Palace.” Chen Ling smiled when he saw Lin Yun walking over before they soared to the sky.

“The Great Profound Palace is the place you previously talked about?” Lin Yun curiously asked. Chen Ling said he had somewhere to go when they arrived.

“Yeah. The Great Profound Palace is the best place in the Sword Sect; it’s not inferior to the Saint Mountain.” Chen Ling nodded and explained, “That place is where the Great Profound Sword Canon is located. The Great Profound Sword Canon isn’t just a canon; it contains many principles of the Sword Dao to comprehend the inherited sword sutras. It can make it easier to comprehend the sword sutras, but it’s a pity that the benefits aren’t as great as the other four sword sutras. I also have no idea what the reason is.”

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered when he heard that. It appears that most of the disciples in the Sword Sect didn’t know about the Nether Sea. Martial Uncle Dustlight was good to him, telling him the secrets of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra when they had just met.

Then again, there was nothing anyone could do, even if they knew about the secrets. Even Lin Yun wasn’t confident that he could form the Netherflower while being at the Elysium Core Realm; he didn’t even have the time to look at it.

“Since there aren’t any benefits, is there a difference if I go there?” Lin Yun asked.

Chen Ling enviously replied, while shaking his head, “You can’t put it that way. Why refuse something for free when it’s within your authority as a heaven direct disciple? You must know that visiting the Great Profound Palace once costs 100,000 contribution points. Not even those in the top ten on the Heaven Ranking can come and go as they wish. Furthermore…”

“Furthermore, what?”

“If I remember correctly, even those senior brothers in the Dragon Pulse Realm have spent contribution points just to barely enter the first stage of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. Without the Great Profound Palace, it’s practically impossible to make it into the first stage…” With a grave expression, Chen Ling continued in a discouraged tone, “Actually, so what if we can’t reach the first stage? It’s just the first stage, and you can only enter the threshold by completing all three stages!”

Lin Yun held onto his chin and wondered if it was that troublesome to cultivate the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

While they were heading to the Great Profound Palace, several figures landed on a certain place in the Golden Firmament Peak. There were six people, and the sword auras they were releasing were powerful and sharp, and all six carried a sword box behind them.

If someone was there, they would definitely be shocked because these six were the top ten of the Earth Ranking. But four of their gazes fell onto a young man donned in golden clothes. This young man was the strongest Elysium Core Realm disciple of the Golden Firmament Peak, Jin Xuanyi. He was also ranked second on the Earth Ranking.

“Jin Xuanyi, how long are you going to stay silent? That brat has already come out and is heading to the Great Profound Palace. If you show up, you might be able to stop him!” A hot-tempered person yelled at the golden-clothed youth.

“Haha. Huangfu Yan, the Scarlet Firmament Peak, didn’t say a word, so why did you come to look for me?” The golden-clothed youth slowly opened his eyes with a smile on his lips.

Although Huangfu Yan ranked tenth on the Earth Ranking and had a fiery temper, no one dared to look down on him. This was because Huangfu Yan wasn’t any weaker than the other genius in the top ten on the Earth Ranking.

But what made others look down on him was that his father was the peak master of the Azure Firmament Peak, and the Azure Storm Saint Lord was his grandfather. The Azure Storm Saint Lord was the saint who took Jiang Chen in as a disciple on the test.

“I don’t believe that you’re convinced of him becoming a heaven direct disciple. That brat just joined the Sword Sect, and he’s allowed to immediately enter the Great Profound Palace. Just think about how hard it is for us to enter the Great Profound Palace! It costs us 100,000 contribution points! What gives?!” Huangfu Yan coldly replied.

But Jin Xuanyi was calm after hearing what Huangfu Yan said before he smiled, “What’s wrong with that? He’s a heaven direct disciple, and it’s his right to enter.”

The expressions of the few others around changed with their brows jumping. After all, they were too sensitive to the words ‘heaven direct disciple’ right now, and they would feel irritated whenever someone mentioned it.

The sect master immediately decided it, so it was no longer a matter of fairness. It was simply a resounding slap to their faces, and slapping the faces of everyone that was at the top ten of the Earth Ranking.

“You really have a high tolerance.” Huangfu Yan sneered. “Do you know what treasure the sect master gave him?”

“What is it?”

“Shouldn’t it be a secret?”

Jin Xuanyi still didn’t say a word, but Huangfu Yan’s words piqued everyone’s curiosity. They were also surprised as they looked at Huangfu Yan because this should be a secret since it was given by the sect master personally, and it wasn’t something someone in the disciple generation should know about. But judging from the looks of it, Huangfu Yan seems to have some insider information.

“My master talked with those from the Elder Hall, and I eavesdropped on their conversation. This matter caused a huge uproar, and even they were shocked. As for you guys, you guys will never be able to imagine what it is!” Huangyu Yan continued.

“So, what is it?”

“Huangfu Yan, stop keeping us in suspense.” Everyone could feel something scratching their hearts, but Huangfu Yan didn’t say a word with his eyes fixed on Jin Xuanyi.

“Speak.” Jin Xuanyi said with his brow raised.

“Divine Golden Crow Iron!” Huangfu Yan answered.

“That is impossible!” Everyone burst into an uproar with disbelief filling their pupils with their jaws dropped.

“How can that be…” Jin Xuanyi’s facial expression finally changed. He had to admit that he was envious and could no longer maintain his composure. After all, it was the Divine Golden Crow Iron, and the sect master just gave it to Lin Yun?
