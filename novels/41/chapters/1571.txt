Chapter 1572 - The Saint Sword Belongs To Me, Any Objections? (2)

“It’s not that they’re strong, but Tian Xuanzi is the strong one. The Profound Sky Sect’s current foundation is clearly stronger than the other seven sects.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said. “The Profound Sky Sect was the winner of the past few Ancient Barren Battlefields. After they completed those incomplete books, those books became their sect’s foundation. The moment the Radiant Sword Saint passes away, no one in the Ancient Barren Domain will be able to contend with them.”

A loud sound echoed from the horizon right at that moment. The white dragon dissipated under the attacks from Luo Yuan and the others, returning to a white sword. The white sword was flawless, glowing brightly, and it looked like a piece of jade.

Just the sword ray released by the white sword alone was enough to prove that it was extraordinary. The moment the sword reappeared, several figures dashed forth. But there was a flaming figure that was like a comet descending from the sky, leaving everyone behind. When that person reached out, he grabbed onto the white saint sword.

“It really is a Glory Saint Artifact!” That person was Luo Yuan. He descended from the sky with the White Dragon Saint Sword in his hand. While sensing the power contained within the sword, Luo Yuan looked at the runes engraved on it with appreciation, and he soon saw the glory spirits on the sword and the scabbard.

The sword struggled within his hand with a smear of moonlight accompanied by chill, releasing a ferocious aura. It soon covered Luo Yuan’s arm in a layer of ice, before the chill penetrated his skin, spreading towards his shoulder.

“Silence!” Luo Yuan sinisterly laughed as he released his flame intent, instantly dispelling the chill from the sword.

But just when he was about to grab onto the sword again, three figures flew over and attacked without any hesitation.

Mu Xueqin released a scarlet sun behind her, and the sword ray she released manifested into a flaming dragon that was charging over with a destructive aura.

The Vajra Monastery’s Luo Xi was enveloped in a holy golden light with a staff in his hand. When he swung the staff, four light spheres gathered at the top of the staff with lightning crackling and emitting a majestic and solemn aura.

As for the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s Zhang Xuan, he swung his blade, and his Firmament Blade Intent manifested into a sea of blood that made him look like a fiend god.

After coming this far, the other sects’ leaders either backed down from the competition or were like Yan Gu, heavily injured by Luo Yuan. Thus, only Mu Xueqin, Luo Xi, and Zhang Xuan, who were the strongest, stayed in the competition.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“A bunch of annoying flies!” Luo Yuan shook his wrist and stabbed the sword with the sheath into the ground. But when facing the attacks from Mu Xueqin, Luo Xi, and Zhang Xuan, he had no trace of panic on his face.

He balled his fist together as flames blazed on the surface of his body, pushing his greater mastery of fifth-grade flame intent to the limit. When his flame intent dyed the entire sky red, this suppressed the aura released by the three who were charging at him.

“Let me play with you guys, then! Flame Dragon Fist!” Luo Yuan took in a deep breath before throwing three punches. Accompanied by a ferocious roar, his punches made the sky dark, and each punch contained his fifth-grade flame intent.

Empowered by his flame intent, his punch exploded upon colliding with the attacks released by Mu Xueqin, Luo Xi, and Zhang Xuan. His first punch shattered the dragon manifested by Mu Xueqin’s sword ray into pieces, his second punch broke the four light spheres on Luo Xi’s staff, and his third punch tore Zhang Xuan’s blood ocean apart.

But his punches didn’t weaken after resolving Mu Xueqin, Luo Xi, and Zhang Xuan’s attacks. They continued and landed on those three, causing them to throw out blood with their faces becoming pale.

This made Mu Xueqin, Luo Xi, and Zhang Xuan shocked. They knew that Luo Yuan was strong, but they didn’t expect him to be this strong. But they were all ruthless figures and didn’t stop despite suffering severe injuries.

They charged forth without hesitation and engaged Luo Yuan in close combat. The commotion created by their clash was earth-shattering, and they were so fast that others could only see blurs flashing around.

Ten-odd moves later, Luo Yuan unleashed his vitality and sent Mu Xueqin, Luo Xi, and Zhang Xuan flying back.

When those three fell to the ground on their knees, they raised their heads, looking at Luo Yuan with disbelief in their eyes. This was because Luo Yuan had three dragons behind him with spiritual energy surging on him, which was a sign that Luo Yuan had reached the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

Simultaneously, the vitality released by Luo Yuan was comparable to an ancient beast. This meant that Luo Yuan wasn’t the strongest beneath the Golden Generation, but he was one of the Golden Generation. So this naturally left Mu Xueqin, Luo Xu, Zhang Xuan, and other sects’ geniuses in the Heavenly Pool Manor shocked.

After all, Luo Yuan had always been known to be the strongest genius under the Golden Generation. He had finally taken a step to become one of the Golden Generation by reaching the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm before age thirty.

Luo Yuan stood there, coldly looking at the three people before him. Compared to him, their vitalities were like fireflies before the sun, and his gaze made the three’s faces change as they quickly retreated.

“You guys want to leave now? It’s already too late!” A cold light flashed within Luo Yuan’s pupils as he reached out with his hand.

When a gigantic flaming palm formed behind him, Mu Xueqin, Luo Xi, and Zhang Xuan immediately felt a powerful suction force pulling them towards Luo Yuan. When they were pulled over, Luo Yuan balled his fist and threw a punch.

The flaming palm behind him also balled into a fist and slammed into Mu Xueqin, Luo Xi, and Zhang Xuan, along with the Flame Dragon Saint Seal. The massive impact made the three throw out a mouthful of blood as they fell to the ground, causing cracks to spread.

“The saint sword belongs to me. Any objections?” Luo Yuan swept his gaze around, but no one dared to look him straight in the eyes.

“It has come to an end.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord wasn’t surprised by this outcome at all. Others might not be able to detect Luo Yuan’s actual cultivation, but he already knew it beforehand.

A water geyser suddenly exploded from the Dragon Transforming Pool, where an azure-robed figure hovered in the sky above. Before everyone could respond, a voice resounded from that person, “I, Lin Yun, have an objection to that!”

Lin Yun’s sudden appearance made the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord squint his eyes because he finally remembered who he had forgotten. It was no wonder why he had a feeling that he had forgotten someone important.

It turned out that Lin Yun was still in the Dragon Transforming Pool until now. This also meant that the appearance of the Divine Dragon Artifacts might be connected to him!
