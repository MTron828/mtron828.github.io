Chapter 1057 - Nirvana Pellet, Pursuit

After the resounding slap, the Scarlet Blood Dracoape left with Lin Yun and gradually disappeared. Lin Yun’s words lingered in the atmosphere and made everyone feel sacred. They never expected that Lin Yun wasn’t satisfied with today’s outcome.

As for the Nether Divinity Realm Son, he was completely dumbstruck as he lay on the ground with fear flashing in his pupils, “How is that possible…”

It was unimaginable that Lin Yun actually managed to plant two Demonic Astral Flowers in each of his aura oceans when he was only in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Those who were knowledgeable of the Demonic Astral Flowers knew that a fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm expert would be incinerated if they weren’t careful. As for subduing them into the body, no one aside from the Realm Sons had the courage to try.

After all, the Realm Sons had a blood jade planted in their violet palace that helped subdue the Demonic Astral Flowers. Even with the blood jade, it was a perilous process. So the Nether Divinity Realm Son couldn’t believe that Lin Yun managed to plant two flowers in each of his aura oceans.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son began to feel despair in his heart. Suddenly, the sound of a sword shattering echoed into the surroundings.

At this moment, Lin Yun’s aura suddenly deteriorated. When the Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons came over to the Nether Divinity Realm Son, their faces were full of uncertainty. Their chests were pierced through and they were only alive because of their deep foundation.

“Something isn’t right,” said the Profound Dragon Realm Son.

“His sword intent seems to have crumbled…” The Elysium Trigram Realm Son said before looking at the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son pondered briefly before he thought of something and gritted his teeth, “He’s injured! He has to die today no matter what!”

It was the only logical conclusion since Lin Yun had exhausted a great deal of his energy. After all, even the three realm sons were all heavily injured, especially the Profound Dragon and Elysium Trigram Realm Son whose holy spirits had shattered.

If any single one of them had to face Lin Yun’s ‘Heaven and Earth, Unite’ alone, they would’ve lost their lives. After all, the fluctuation was enough to reduce the gold ranking’s geniuses into ashes. Lin Yun had to face three enemies at once, so there was no way he would be alright.

This was why the Nether Divinity Realm Son tried to force Lin Yun into a fair battle. He wanted to see if Lin Yun was injured. Now, he could tell that Lin Yun was heavily injured.

“We can’t let him recover. If we can’t kill him, he’s going to step on us in the final battle!” All three of their eyes flickered as they took out a box from their interspatial pouch. When they opened the box, boundless vitality burst out that left many people shocked.

“What pellet is that?”

“That’s the Nirvana pellet, a saint pellet only inferior to the Revival Pellet. Legend has it that one can recover from their injuries no matter how serious they are. They just can’t die.”

“Is this the foundation of the war realms? Could it be that Lin Yun wasn’t injured?”

“He’s probably injured. Otherwise, the three of them wouldn’t have to waste such a precious pellet.” Everyone looked at the three Realm Sons with shock, especially the other Realm Sons.

“They’re really willing to use the Nirvana Pellet,” smiled the Imperial Diagram Realm Son.

The Nirvana Pellet was precious even among the war realms, and the elders of their clans only gave them one each. After all, this pellet was even useful to Empyrean or Divine Core Realm experts. Clearly, the three of them planned to recover from their injuries immediately in order to pursue Lin Yun.

The Imperial Diagram Realm Son thought of something and figured out what was going on. The Nether Divinity Realm Son was most likely probing Lin Yun earlier, which was why he wasn’t using the Nirvana Pellet. If Lin Yun’s injuries weren’t serious, then he wouldn’t have taken out the pellet.

But now, the situation was flipped on its head. After the three of them took a pellet each, their injuries recovered in a few breaths.

“They don’t have a choice since they were so badly humiliated today,” smiled another Realm Son. At the same time, he looked at Pei Xue, who was standing next to the Imperial Diagram Realm Son, with greed flashing in his eyes.

This made the Imperial Diagram Realm Son lock his brows together as he chose to ignore this person. On the other hand, Pei Xue was feeling nervous.

Roughly half an hour later, the Nether Divinity Realm Son soared into the sky with the other two following close behind. All three of them had a faint phoenix figure appear behind them. Clearly, the pellet didn’t just allow them to recover from their injuries, but it also boosted their strength greatly.

“Chase after them!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son took out a jade pellet and quickly sent out information before he chased Lil’ Red outside the city. Shortly after, five of the other seven Realm Sons also soared into the sky, leaving the Imperial Diagram Realm Son and another realm son behind.

This Imperial Feather Realm Son, who was donned in azure clothes, emitted the aura of an emperor. He was the only one able to obtain a Divine Blood Fruit. He didn’t suffer any injuries to get the fruit, unlike Pei Xue and Yue Weiwei. He was extremely mysterious and the most prideful of the ten war realms.

“Imperial Feather Realm Son, you’re not interested in the Azure Dragon True Bone?” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son asked.

“He activated the true bone’s power when he executed his holy spirit for the second time. This means that he has unsealed at least one layer on the Azure Dragon True Bone. At this point, the true bone has fused with him completely. So the true bone is no longer that useful to us even if I dig it out of him,” smiled the Imperial Feather Realm Son.

The Imperial Diagram Realm Son wasn’t surprised by those words and replied, “Even so, Lin Yun has a lot of secrets and treasures. His holy spirit martial technique alone is very precious…”

“It’s not worth offending three war realms,” smiled the Imperial Feather Realm Son. Lin Yun had completely humiliated the three war realms. So if anyone dared to touch Lin Yun right now, the three war realms would definitely flip the table.

“If there’s no surprises, Lin Yun will die,” said the Imperial Feather Realm Son in a firm tone. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“You seem to have a deeper meaning to your words,” said Pei Xue. Even though the three Realm Sons had the Nirvana Pellet to recover from their injuries, Lin Yun also had the Scarlet Blood Dracoape. As long as he made use of Lil’ Red, he could get out of Four Phase City safely.

“Sword intent should shatter so easily. If I’m not wrong, that lord must’ve glanced at this direction from afar,” smiled the Imperial Feather Realm Son. It seemed like the lord that the Imperial Feather Realm Son spoke of was an elder of a powerful sect that had ties to the Nether Divinity War Realm.

When Pei Xue heard that, her face became even paler.

“Do you plan to act?” The Imperial Feather Realm Son smiled while looking at the Imperial Diagram Realm Son, “After all, he has a great potential and he will surely rise in Kunlun Realm as long as he doesn’t die.”

When he was done, he laughed and left. The Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s face was dark because the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s words could stir a conflict between him and Pei Xue. After a long time, the Imperial Feather Realm Son made a decision and replied, “Let’s go and take a look.”

He knew that Pei Xue might fall out with him if he didn’t do anything. So out of fear, he made a move. However, Pei Xue wasn’t completely sold, so she glared at the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s face while flying out of the city.

“Even the elders acted. How can Lin Yun possibly live?” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son sighed while shaking his head.

Although the elder couldn’t blatantly make a move, he glanced at Lin Yun from afar. This not only shattered Lin Yun’s sky sword intent, but it also crushed his fortune in the Heavenly Path. A dead person like Lin Yun wasn’t worthy of befriending.
