Chapter 1510 - Origin Dragon FruitDiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

When the pairs of crimson eyes appeared in the grey fog, the five body-refining cultivators could feel a chill run down their spines. There were too many of them. With a rough estimation, there were at least eighty of them, and the five body-refining cultivators soon became their targets when they entered the grey fog.

This wasn’t normal, and Ding Lei’s face instantly became pale. Only the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses' eyes could be seen, not their bodies.

“Go!” Jin Ao said without an expression on his face.

“W-We can’t see them at all. So how are body-refining cultivators supposed to deal with them?” Ding Lei stuttered. When he felt uneasy, Chen Xiuhai and Huang Kun didn’t hesitate to charge forth.

“I… I’m backing out…” Ding Lei said in a trembling tone as he slowly retreated.

“Do you think you have a choice now?” Jin Ao sneered as he formed a seal and pointed forth.

Suddenly, Ding Lei discovered that he couldn’t move. The Flame Dragon Saint Armor was like a cage that imprisoned him. This made him even more uneasy, and he yelled, “W-What’s going on? I-I can’t move…”

“Haha, that’s right!” Jin Ao laughed and undid the seal on Ding Lei before sending the latter into the depths of the grey fog with a palm. He then swept his gaze at Lin Yun because he wanted to teach him a lesson. But he discovered Lin Yun had already disappeared into the grey fog, which briefly disappointed him before he snickered, “At least he’s tactful.”

Outside the grey fog, all the envoys ranked in the top five smiled. The second envoy’s eyes lit up with excitement, “It’s really effective. The Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses really have an unusual thirst for the vitality of body-refining cultivators.”

With the five people drawing the attention of the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, it would be easier for them. This was because the five in the grey fog were like lightbulbs in the eyes of the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, and their brimming vitality had a fatal attraction to them.

“They should be all drawn away. Are we going to quickly leave or what?” The third envoy looked at Tian Jue. With all the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses drawn away by the five body-refining cultivators, the Flame Dragon Saint Armor could last for a long time, and it should be enough for them to exit the grey fog.

“Those people are treasures. So how can we waste them here?” Tian Jue smiled. He briefly waited before he yelled, “Start clearing the demonic corpses!”

On his command, all the experts of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion charged into the grey fog.

“That bastard!” An Liuyan’s face became pale, and she finally realized that Tian Jue planned to use the five body-refining cultivators as bait right from the start.

“Calm down. I believe in Brother Lin.” Xiao Yun said.

In the end, An Liuyan could only bite her lips because there was nothing she could do to Tian Jue in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.

“I see…” Lin Yun muttered to himself. The method was for the body-refining cultivators to draw the attention of the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, and their vitality had a fatal attraction for those demonic corpses.

If the vitality of an ordinary person was like an herb, the five’s vitality was equivalent to elixirs in the eyes of those Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses. As for Lin Yun, he was comparable to saint elixirs in the eyes of those demonic corpses.

Since the Azure Dragon Saint Art had refined his vitality, it could drive those Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses insane while they were rushing towards him. The situation was the same for the other four.

Every time the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses attacked, Lin Yun could sense a part of his vitality being devoured, and the demonic corpses would become even more insane after tasting it.

As for the other experts of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion, the demonic corpses didn’t pay any attention to them when they came in, and he now knew why the demonic corpses would go after him back in the cave. But as his eyes flickered, he felt something wasn’t right because this was the same as strengthening your enemies.

“These Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses don’t seem so impressive after all!”

“Haha! They look so stupid. How are they terrifying?”

“Kill them all!” The envoys of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion all had excitement on their faces when they saw this scene, and this nearly made the five body-refining cultivators throw out mouthfuls of blood.

They were practically surrounded by the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, drawing all the attention. So how could it not be easy for the others? Since they had to face the demonic corpses head-on, they couldn’t even put up any resistance.

The Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses only had their eyes exposed, and their bodies were invisible. But it wasn’t just their bodies being invisible; neither sword intent nor other martial intents could sense their existences. Even their crimson eyes were flickering without any sense of life.

They could only sense the existence of the demonic corpses when they were attacked, and their claws seemed to appear out of nowhere.

When a transparent claw landed on the Flame Dragon Saint Armor, Lin Yun could sense his vitality being sucked out through the saint armor. He was fortunate to have the saint armor and fortified his internal organs with dragon runes. So not much of his vitality was devoured.

But there were too many Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, and their attacks were endless. So he didn’t even have the time to avoid their attacks, and he would be exhausted to death here sooner or later.

Then again, Lin Yun was calm and didn’t panic. He quickly performed the Earth Sword Form with his fingers. When his sword rays enveloped him, the demonic claws' speed slowed down, allowing Lin Yun to execute the Divine Sunchasing Art in the narrow space, pushing his movement technique to the limit.

As time flowed, Lin Yun actually got better in his movement technique in such a short period. Then again, dangers could excavate the potential of someone.

In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun moved eighteen times, like an agile fish in a lake. To those outside, it looked as though he didn’t move, but a phenomenon had appeared with space overlapping. This brought joy to Lin Yun’s face because the benefits of the Divine Golden Crow Iron were slowly being excavated.

But he had no idea when he could use the divine rune within the Divine Golden Crow Iron. Now that he looked at it again, it appeared that he still had a long way to go. Relying on his movement technique, Lin Yun had an easier time facing the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses.

Right then, Chen Xiuhai threw out a mouthful of blood, and his face became pale underneath the helmet. This made Lin Yun surprised before eight thousand dragon runes poured into his hands. When he pushed his hands forth, several demonic corpses were shoved aside before Lin Yun appeared beside Chen Xiuhai.

Lin Yun quickly made a move and circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art to block several demonic corpses. Looking at Chen Xiuhai, Lin Yun smiled, “Mister, be more careful.”

“Looks like my age is catching up to me.” Chen Xiuhai gratefully nodded before he bitterly smiled. He didn’t have much lifespan left, to begin with. Now that his vitality was being devoured, this was simply fatal to him. Although he had an easier time now with Lin Yun’s help, it wasn’t a permanent solution.

Four hours later, when all the demonic corpses were dealt with, the ground was littered with their corpses, and Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with doubt when they saw this scene.

“Continue to lead the way!” Jin Ao urged Lin Yun and others to clear the path.

They smoothly made it through the grey fog, and an herbal field appeared. This instantly made everyone from the Heavenly Astral Pavilion excited. After all, Divine Dragon Bones were rare. On the other hand, saint elixirs and saint fruits were things that they could see.

“Big Brother Tian Jue, there really is an herbal field here!” The second envoy’s eyes became hearted because this was an unexplored region. It was unavoidable for the envoys ranked in the top five to be excited.

“Alright. You guys go collect the herbs. No one else is allowed to move!” Tian Jue said as he looked at the five body-refining cultivators.

This made Ding Lei’s eyes light up, and he dragged his exhausted body to a saint tree. But Lin Yun shook his head and knew that this was definitely fishy.

The outcome was also just as he had expected. There was a crimson vortex around each saint tree, and they would be devoured if they weren’t careful. Even if they were attentive, it would still exhaust a lot of their vitality, and this instantly made the faces of everyone aside from Lin Yun even paler than before. They lost too much vitality, and it started to harm their lifespan.

“Origin Dragon Fruit!” Chen Xiuhai’s hand trembled with excitement when he retrieved a rare fruit. This was a saint fruit that could improve one’s aptitude.

“It’s really the Origin Dragon Fruit!”

“The Origin Dragons are a rare species of true dragons, and the Origin Dragon Fruit contains the blood of Origin Dragons. Legend has it that it could allow one to possess a saint physique after devouring this fruit. Even in the worst case scenario, it would transform one’s aptitude!” Many envoys were surrounding Chen Xiuhai with excitement flashing in their pupils.

Chen Xiuhai became emotional because this was what he needed. As previously agreed upon, he had the right to keep this fruit. With this Origin Dragon Fruit, he could immediately make a breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm, and he had a chance of becoming a king in the future.

But the Origin Dragon Fruit suddenly disappeared from his hand and appeared in Tian Jue’s hand. Tian Jue was looking at it with interest, “Not bad.”

The four other envoys were also excited because this was a genuine Origin Dragon Fruit.

“D-Didn’t you give your promise previously?” Chen Xiuhai became emotional but didn’t dare to throw any temper.

As Tian Jue raised his eyebrow, he replied, “I did say that all of you can pick a saint fruit or saint elixir. I’ll keep this for now, and I’ll give it to you when we’re out of the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.”

Chen Xiuhai was so furious that he began to tremble, but he didn’t dare to say a word. There were four crimson vortexes around that saint tree, and he spent a great deal of effort to retrieve the fruit. Who knew that Tian Jue would immediately take it from him and even claim that he would keep it safe for him?

“Lord Envoy, you’re talented and already possess a saint physique. This Origin Dragon Fruit doesn’t have any effects on you.” Chen Xiuhai said in a trembling tone with a faint desire.

“What the hell are you talking about?”

“Big Brother Tian Jue said that he’ll safe it keep for you. So what are you thinking? Do you think everyone is stingy like you?”

“Don’t forget who brought you to the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, and who brought you into the Dragon Burial Valley!” The second envoy impatiently said, and his words instantly made Chen Xiuhai speechless, with his face turning red.

In the end, Chen Xiuhai lowered his head, “I’m sorry for misunderstanding, Lord Envoy.”

“This is your final warning.” Tian Jue said before he left with the Origin Dragon Fruit.

Lin Yun wasn’t far from them, and he could hear what they were talking about.

“Haha, that old fool really thinks that he can leave this place alive.”

“The Origin Dragon Fruit is wasted with him.”

“Even if Big Brother Tian Jue doesn’t need it, he can just swap it for other treasures. After all, there are all sorts of treasures in the Heavenly Heart Pavilion.”

This meant that Chen Xiuhai would have to give up on the Origin Dragon Fruit, and it was a pipedream for these people to be benevolent. Shaking his head, Lin Yun asked, “Empress, can you sense the fluctuation of the Divine Dragon Bone?”

“It shouldn’t be far away.” Lin Yun took a deep breath for him to calm down with great difficulty because he was already reaching his limit.
