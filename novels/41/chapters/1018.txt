Chapter 1019 - Kill 'Em All!

The moon blooming in Lin Yun’s palm had a silver phoenix radiating with a metallic luster. It was ancient and noble, emanating a divine aura from Lin Yun’s palm. When Lin Yun was enveloped in the moonlight, he looked even more graceful than normal.

Under the moonlight, there was also a moon reflected on the lake, which made the demonic wolves look at Lin Yun with shock and awe. Even the elderly wolves who had unfavorable opinions about Lin Yun suddenly became devoted, looking at Lin Yun as if Lin Yun deserved their praise.

After all, the Lunar Soul Herb was their sacred herb and this lake was their sacred lake. Even the chief’s eyes were fixated on Lin Yun at this moment. Of course, it had been years since such a phenomenon was seen in their sacred land. The fact that an outsider was creating this phenomenon was unbelievable.

On the lake, Lin Yun moved and began to practice the Divine Glorymoon Fist. He was already very proficient with this fist technique, especially since he had the Divine Glorysun Fist as his foundation. So everything naturally went smoothly.

In his palm, the Divine Moon Breaking Seal was blooming brightly. The Divine Glorymoon Fist was similar to the Divine Glorysun Fist as it was separated into three stages. However, the phenomenon wasn’t the same as the sun. The Divine Glorysun Fist forms proceeded from dawn to sunset, but the Divine Glorymoon Fist started and ended with a full moon.

“Moon Aroma!” A full moon rose while emanating a flower fragrance. This was the first phenomenon of the Divine Glorymoon Fist, massive and sacred.

“Soaring Lunar Grasp!” Lin Yun then soared into the sky while the flawless moon manifested a hand of a celestial. This was the phenomenon of the Divine Glorymoon Fist’s second form, Soaring Lunar Grasp.

Pei Xue was watching with a grave expression and discovered that there was a huge difference between the phenomenon manifested by Lin Yun and Yu Haotian. The phenomenon manifested by Yu Haotian was filled with a demonic aura, so the noble moon was defiled. On the other hand, the phenomena created by Lin Yun was full of nobility and divinity.

Is this the true Divine Moon Breaking Seal? Pei Xue couldn’t help but wonder what Lin Yun was doing. She could clearly tell that the grades of power were changing with Lin Yun’s talent. It was shocking that the Divine Glorymoon Fist was so profound.

Suddenly, the sky began to change as an apocalyptic aura spread out. Pei Xue was in shock as she raised her head to look at the moon descending with a destructive aura. There were also countless stars falling from the sky that streaked across the horizon like fireballs.

This was the third form of the Divine Glorymoon Fist — Comet Moon. Looking at this phenomenon, uneasiness and fear quickly spread out among the demonic wolves. Lin Yun smiled when he saw this and dispelled the phenomenon.

Naturally, he couldn’t allow the moon to descend or the demonic wolves would come after him. Like the Divine Glorysun Fist, the Divine Glorymoon Fist also had a secret technique that combined all nine phenomena, called Everlasting Moon.

“Everlasting Moon!” Lin Yun muttered while looking at the lake. Soon enough, the forms of the Divine Glorysun Fist began to appear in his mind that corresponded with the Divine Glorymoon Fist. He could feel that the two martial techniques were slowly combining.

“I see…” Lin Yun smiled.

The sun and moon weren’t the same, but they could complement each other. After reaching high proficiency with the two fist techniques, Lin Yun discovered a new enlightenment with the fist techniques. He realized that he could reach the pinnacle of the imperial fortune martial technique. With that, he wouldn’t fear any imperial fortune martial techniques against enemies in the same cultivation.

Two jade slips appeared in Lin Yun’s hand as he looked at them with excitement. He was looking forward to combining them.

Just like that, Lin Yun gained new comprehension while a celestial mist made him look ethereal. Suddenly, the demonic wolves became uneasy because the Nether Divinity War Realm had arrived. Under Nie Xuan’s rage, all his servants and the higher realms had searched aggressively for Lin Yun.

So a huge party arrived on demonic vultures. They looked like a demonic cloud as they emitted a terrifying pressure. Even Pei Xue’s face changed when she raised her head because she recognized Nie Xuan’s servants. They must have arrived because Lin Yun accidentally exposed his location earlier.

Although they might be mere servants, their strength was comparable to the Profound Lightning Twin Swords, not to mention that they were elites.

When Pei Xue saw the massive party in the sky, her face paled. Disregarding the overlord demonic beasts and higher realms, there were seven war realm elites. At this moment, the demonic wolves were feeling uneasy. Even Pei Xue was also feeling uneasy because this was the first time she had faced such a huge party. Up to this point, they had only faced small assaults.

“What a huge formation. But it’s a pity that the general you spoke of isn’t there.” A disappointed voice spoke next to Pei Xue. When Pei Xue turned her head over, she saw that Lin Yun had woken up from his state of comprehension.

“Stop boasting. Quick, we have to leave right now. They’re elite servants of Nie Xuan, and this means that he isn’t far from here.” Pei Xue wanted to leave before they were discovered because she was feeling uneasy.

“Leave?” Lin Yun smiled coldly. He had given the war realms face by holding back this whole time. Even with Mo Xuan, he only crippled him and didn’t take his life. After all, there was no need for him to completely fall out of favor with the war realms. Things could still turn back as long as no lives were taken.

But he had finally run out of patience because his act of mercy had given the war realms the wrong impression. Apparently, they thought that he was too scared to do anything. Since that was the case, he wouldn’t hold back anymore.

Did they really treat him as a pushover? So what if they were from the war realms? If they made him unhappy, he would just slay them! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Before Pei Xue could react, she was dragged by Lin Yun as they charged forward. This instantly made Pei Xue’s face change because they were walking right into the trap.

“Y-y-you! What are you trying to do!” Pei Xue asked with her voice trembling.

“I’m going to kill them. What else would I be doing?” Lin Yun grinned and executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations. He soared into the sky with Pei Xue like a golden streak of light. An hour later, the two of them landed on the ground and faced the black clouds of demonic vultures.

“Hey, it’s the treacherous couple. They’re actually walking right into the trap…” The one who spoke was donned in golden armor. He was the leader and an elite from the Nether Divinity War Realm. He had many contributions to the war realm, which was why he was wearing the famous Blacklight Battle Armor.

“Who are you referring to?!” Pei Xue instantly fell into a rage with her face turning pale.

“The butcher and the slut. Isn’t it obvious who we’re referring to?” Beside the leader was a gray-clothed youth who looked at Pei Xue coldly.

“Servants of the Nether Divinity War Realm, don’t push it! You guys will suffer when we’re out of the Heavenly Path!” Pei Xue replied.

“Interesting.” The gray-clothed youth smiled. “Even if you make it out alive, do you think that the war realms don't have any foundation in the Kunlun Realm?

“One has the Divine Blood Fruit while the other has the Azure Dragon True Bone. Are you really that stupid to think that you can escape the pursuit of the war realms? Hand over your items and beg for your life. Perhaps we can consider sparing your lives,” said another person.

The gray-clothed youth looked down on Pei Xue and grinned, “I heard that people of your clan are pretty skilled. Submit to me and I can consider convincing the General to spare your life.”

“Get lost!” Pei Xue gritted her teeth as her entire body trembled with rage.

“Hahaha!” Her response merely attracted ridicule because none of them placed Lin Yun and Pei Xue in their eyes. In their eyes, these two were slightly stronger ants.

“Why aren’t you kneeling to the Nether Divinity War Realm?!” The leader roared as his voice echoed throughout the sky. He was trying to intimidate Lin Yun and inform Nie Xuan that they had found their targets.

“Who do you want to kill?” Lin Yun ignored the party in front of him and turned to Pei Xue.

“All of them!” Pei Xuan had practically lost it right now. But she immediately regretted her words the moment she replied.

Upon hearing her, Lin Yun smiled, “You’re right. We should kill them all.”

Killing intent began to flash in his eyes because he was planning to dye the sky red with blood from the Nether Divinity War Realm.
