Chapter 1696 – Let Me Teach You!

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s Law Enforcement Hall was located at the summit of the ninth mountain. This mountain had a massive palace with a roof over a few hundred meters. Not only did it look spacious, but it also gave off an oppressive aura.

Lin Yun followed behind the ten-odd Law-Enforcing Elders without any panic on his face. Every sect had a Law Enforcement Hall, but some might have a different name, such as the Sword-Bearing Hall. But their responsibility was the same.

He had already expected this outcome when he crippled the Law Enforcement Hall’s Grand Elder. But he was calm and composed.

“Brat, you’re not afraid?” The blue-robed middle-aged man who took the lead looked at Lin Yun with surprise. After all, Lin Yun showed no resistance in coming to the Law Enforcement Hall and was calm and composed.

“You guys won’t punish me if I’m afraid?” Lin Yun asked.

The blue-robed middle-aged man was the second elder of the Law Enforcement Elder, named Gu Jun. His position was only second to Jiang Yu's.

Gu Jun coldly looked at Lin Yun, “Of course not. If Saint Elder hadn’t instructed us earlier, you’d already have become a cripple. Even if Jiang Feng is an ordinary disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, you’re in no position to punish him, no matter what he did.”

“What a joke.” Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with Gu Jun and carried on.

Gu Jun’s face was dark. Lin Yun was at their mercy, but he still dared to act with such arrogance.

“Brat, watch your attitude towards Elder Gu!” The other elders unhappily reprimanded him.

“No point talking if we’re not on the same page.” Lin Yun said.

“It doesn’t matter because you won’t be able to escape. Even if you’re not dead, your cultivation and ten fingers will definitely be crippled. Let me see how you can maintain your arrogance later.” Gu Jun replied.

“What if I’m fine?” Lin Yun looked at Gu Jun with a playful smile.

“Fine?” Gu Jun snickered. “Who do you think you are? The disciple of a musician clan? Even if you’re a descendant of an Ancient Saint Clan, an Ancient Saint Clan is nothing before my Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion!”

Wearing a playful expression, Lin Yun said, “You’ll give me ten Profound Saint Pellets if I’m fine. Do you dare to take the bet?”

“You’re already finished, and you still dare to be so arrogant? You don’t seem capable, but your temper is as foul as Flower Burial.” Gu Jun laughed. “Don’t even think about relying on those two little girls. Even if Her Highness, the Profound Fairy, came, no one can interfere with the Law Enforcement Hall’s matters!”

“Cut the crap. Do you, or do you not dare to take the bet?” Lin Yun asked.

“Sure. That zither of yours isn’t bad, and you definitely won’t be able to play it anymore after today. If you lose the bet, that zither belongs to me.” Gu Jun chuckled.

“That’s a deal.” Lin Yun smiled, not giving Gu Jun a chance to go back on his words.

The other elders were briefly stunned, and they soon snickered. After all, what Lin Yun said was practically impossible in their eyes. But Lin Yun’s gaze made Gu Jun uncertain, and he wondered if Lin Yun had any trump cards.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to be brought to the Law Enforcement Hall. The roof was tall, and the hall was spacious, giving the Law Enforcement Hall a solemn atmosphere.

Aside from Jiang Yu, the other Law-Enforcing Elders had heard the news and were already gathered here. When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see Mu Xueling seated on the chair at the center.

Half an incense later, the elder who went to investigate handed the report to Gu Jun. He said, “Saint Elder, this matter has already been thoroughly investigated. It started from a quarrel between Lin Yun and Jiang Feng before it developed into a fight. After Jiang Feng lost, Lin Xiao crippled his cultivation and fingers. All the disciples and Ancient Saint Clans’ descendants present can attest to it.”

What happened on the Saint Altar wasn’t complicated, and the Law Enforcement Hall swiftly investigated this matter thoroughly.

“Ha.” Lin Yun snickered with mockery in his pupils. What did he mean by quarrel? It was a one-sided provocation from that brat. Not to mention that he brushed it off simply by saying Jiang Feng lost. If he were the one that lost, his outcome wouldn’t be any better than Jiang Feng's.

“Lin Yun, what is with that attitude of yours? Do you have an opinion against the Law Enforcement Hall, or do you have an opinion against me?” Gu Jun asked.

“Lin Yun, you can speak if you have a different view.” Mu Xueling looked at Lin Yun.

“None.” Lin Yun replied indifferently.

Seeing this, Gu Jun inwardly sneered because he thought Lin Yun had a plan.

“None?” Mu Xueling asked again.

“None.” Lin Yun replied, looking at Mu Xueling. Even if Jiang Feng was the one who provoked him first, he had no reason to cripple the latter. So he knew Mu Xueling wouldn’t let him off because of that reason, and this matter couldn’t be explained with a few words. So Lin Yun might as well not say anything.

“Since he has nothing to say, let me cripple him personally!” A cold voice resounded that instantly made the temperature in the hall fall. When everyone turned their gazes over, they saw Jiang Yu walking in with killing intent filling his pupils.

He had just returned from examining Jiang Feng’s injuries, and he nearly fainted on the spot because his son’s injuries were too severe. His five dragon pulses were destroyed, and his fingers were crushed. Even if a Great Saint personally made a move, they might not be able to save his son. Lin Yun was simply too ruthless.

When Jiang Yu walked over with his face dark, none of the elders dared to say a word because they could sense that Jiang Yu was on the brink of losing it.

“I hope that Saint Elder can fulfill my wish!” Jiang Yu gritted his teeth as he looked at Mu Xueling.

Mu Xueling had no changes on her face, and she could guess that Jiang Feng provoked Lin Yun first. But even so, this wasn’t the reason Lin Yun crippled Jiang Feng. He could retaliate, but crippling Jiang Feng’s cultivation and fingers was too brutal.

“Lin Yun, do you have anything else you wish to say?” Mu Xueling asked. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Nothing.” Lin Yun replied calmly.

All the elders present were surprised because they had no idea where Lin Yun got the confidence to maintain such composure and not beg for mercy. Even Gu Jun was surprised because Lin Yun didn’t look like a musician from his temper. Instead, he looked more like a swordsman.

“Are you willing to accept your punishment, then?” Mu Xueling asked without any expression on her face.

“Nope.” Lin Yun said as he raised his head.

This immediately sent the Law Enforcement Hall into an uproar, and Gu Jun said, “You think you have a say in this? Grand Elder, you can just go ahead and make a move. You don’t need to waste time talking to a barbarian like him!”

“Great!” Jiang Yu’s face was cold as he released his aura as a Samsara Edict Realm expert and had it envelop Lin Yun. He restricted his cultivation back then, which was why he took a beating from Lin Yun. But now, it was time for him to show Lin Yun the reality.

But Lin Yun merely glanced at Jiang Yu before retracting his gaze, “No need to hurry. I have nothing to say, nor do I have any intentions of disputing. I hope you guys can listen to a song of mine before punishing me, and I’m willing to accept any punishment after that.”

“What a joke. Who do you think you are? A mere Musician like you wants to perform before Grand Musicians like us? Brat, you think too highly of yourself!” Jiang Yu was on the verge of losing control of his killing intent and had no intention of listening to Lin Yun.

“The Grand Elder is right!”

“This brat wants to buy time for Her Highness, the Profound Fairy, to save him.”

“Her Highness, the Profound Fairy, cannot interfere in the Law Enforcement Hall’s matters. There’s no need to waste time with him.” The other elders said coldly, and they naturally had to give Jiang Yu some face.

But Mu Xueling suddenly thought of something, recalling the phoenix cry from before. She said, “Elder Jiang, back down, for now.”

“Saint Elder…” Jiang Yu naturally wasn’t willing to give up the opportunity to deal with Lin Yun here.

“As a musician, it’s not too much of a request to play a song before his death. You don’t have to be in such a hurry since he has nothing to say for himself. So he will definitely be punished according to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s rules!” Mu Xueling said.

Despite Jiang Yu still feeling reluctant, he knew there was nothing he could say because Mu Xueling already spoke out twice, and he could only wait until Lin Yun finished playing a song.

“I’ll let you live a little longer, then!” Jiang Yu sat back down with a dark expression.

On the other hand, Gu Jun was puzzled and had no idea what Lin Yun was planning. Was he trying to buy time for Her Highness, the Profound Fairy, to arrive? After all, it was too naive to think he could change the current situation just by playing a song.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun sat down and took out the Thunderstorm Zither.

“What are you going to play?” Mu Xueling asked.

“The Prairie Phoenix Fire.” Lin Yun said as he adjusted the zither strings.

“I asked you before. So why were you not willing to play back then?” Mu Xueling asked.

“That’s because you didn’t play it well, and I couldn’t figure out the problem. If I can’t perform the true profundity in a song, what’s the difference between playing and not playing?” Lin Yun replied, raising his head.

His words immediately shocked the entire Law Enforcement Hall, and all the elders were dumbfounded. Was Lin Yun really that tired of living? Mu Xueling definitely wasn’t simple since she could become a Saint Elder. Not only was she younger than everyone present, but she had also reached the Quasi-Saint Realm. She also had deep and unfathomable attainment in music dao; a Grand Musician was nothing before her.

So wasn’t Lin Yun courting death to doubt Mu Xueling? Did he really think that Mu Xueling didn’t have any temper? She was a Quasi-Saint, one that was comparable to a true Saint. But Lin Yun dared to doubt Mu Xueling, which was no different from humiliating a Saint!

As everyone had expected, Mu Xueling had a wisp of fury on her face when she heard that. She asked, “Then tell me, what am I lacking in the Prairie Phoenix Fire?”

On the other side, Jiang Yu smirked because he knew Lin Yun’s act was no different from courting death by doubting the Saint Elder. If the Saint Elder was the one who made a move, it would have nothing to do with him, even if the Profound Fairy wanted to blame someone for it.

But Lin Yun didn’t respond to Mu Xueling’s questions straight-on and asked, “Let me ask you something. Has Saint Elder experienced the pain of losing someone important?”

The scene of Big Brother Jin Jue dying back in the Great Qin Empire was still deeply engraved in his mind.

Looking at the regret and pain hidden within Lin Yun’s pupils, Mu Xueling didn’t dare to look straight at Lin Yun’s eyes. A brief moment later, she muttered, “No.”

“Then, have you experienced life and death but can only watch your companion sacrifice themself for you?” Lin Yun continued to question.

Back in the Profound Amber Realm, Lil’ Purple was reduced to a cocoon after saving him, and he was filled with rage about that. He hated that the sword in his hand wasn’t sharp enough.

When Mu Xueling heard Lin Yun’s question, she fell into silence.

“Saint Elder, have you experienced life and death with enemies all around you?” Lin Yun continued with his questions. As he spoke, he recalled what happened in the Heavenly Path with enemies all around as he waved good-bye to Yue Weiwei.

“Saint Elder, have you hated the world for being unfair? Your loved ones are right before your eyes, but there’s nothing you can do but watch them leave.” Lin Yun continued.

This time, Mu Xueling’s confidence fell, and she didn’t even dare to look Lin Yun straight in the eyes anymore.

“You have experienced nothing, so how can you know what you’re lacking in the Prairie Phoenix Fire? Let me tell you what you’re lacking!” Lin Yun looked at Mu Xueling. “Your Prairie Phoenix Fire lacks the wisp of ferocity, a ferocity of wanting to incinerate the whole world and hate the heavens for being unjust. The ferocity of wanting to bury the entire mortal realm. Today, let me show you the real Prairie Phoenix Fire!”

When Lin Yun gently strummed the zither, it was only a single note, but everyone could sense boundless rage and killing intent that dyed the entire zither red. As thunderstorms raged and crimson flames blazed, the torrential ferocity manifested into a phoenix cry that made the whole Law Enforcement Hall tremble.

Jiang Yu, who was initially watching from the side with mockery in his pupils, was stumped when he saw this scene.
