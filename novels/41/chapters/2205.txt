Chapter 2206 - Recite My Name!

Lin Yun had slain a Saint Lord before, so why would he fear one? Using the power of his divine physique and sword intent, Lin Yun caught the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord by surprise and struck the Sovereign Dragon Seal against the latter’s body.

This made the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord throw out blood with his face distorted from the pain, and he was shocked. He couldn’t believe he was injured by someone who was only at the Quasi-Saint Realm. This was unacceptable, even if he was caught by surprise.

“Die!” When he was sent flying away, the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord circulated his saint origin, and his saint aura formed into an even more terrifying saint energy, manifesting into a palm that clashed with the Sovereign Dragon Seal.

After reaching the Saint Realm, the saint aura could be purified through saint origin, turning into an energy ten times stronger than the saint aura. This was an unfathomable transformation, signifying the difference between mortals and saints. Quasi-Saints only had half of their foot onto the saint path, not entirely.

The Sovereign Dragon Seal shattered quickly, and the crimson palm flew towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun could have evaded but didn't because Bai Shuying and the other Quasi-Saints, such as the Dao Yang Holy Son, were behind him. If he dodged, those people behind him would be killed or crippled.

“Let me see how you’re going to block this attack!” After the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord landed on the ground, he took a few steps back and was shocked. This was because the Astral Sword Intent was contained in the Sovereign Dragon Seal, and not even his saint energy could resolve the Astral Sword Intent.

“If I can’t block it, I won’t block it, then!” Lin Yun roared without hesitation, executing the first form of the Sovereign Dragon Fist—Soaring Divine Dragon!

Over a hundred dragons appeared around Lin Yun, letting out a roar as the dragons looked realistic under the empowerment of the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

Lin Yun clenched his fist and the hundred dragons poured into it. As the Dragon’s Blood within his body boiled, the hundred dragons formed into a dragon’s head that roared as it charged at the giant palm.

In fact, against absolute power, it was a futile effort no matter how profound his sword technique was. As a result, he could only rely on attacking as a form of defense, relying on the Azure Dragon Divine Physique to withstand the blow.

When the dragon’s head clashed with the crimson palm, fine cracks appeared on the palm, and the speed was also slowed down. But this attack manifested with saint energy and wasn’t shattered on the spot as it continued to fly towards Lin Yun.

Dragon Sun and Moon Seal—Inverting Yin-Yang!

Lin Yun didn’t panic but formed seals. As heaven and earth inverted, space began to distort. The spatial energy ripped the crimson palm into pieces, but the shockwave still landed against Lin Yun. But only one-tenth of the power was left, and Lin Yun persevered with the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. He merely let out a groan and didn’t take a step back.

When everyone saw this scene, their faces changed because a Quasi-Saint had withstood the attack of a Saint. But that wasn’t all as Lin Yun flicked his finger, unleashing a sword ray with the power of the Astral Sword Intent. The sword ray that could even tear through the air landed on the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord, but it only left ripples behind.

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord smiled, “The Astral Sword Intent is powerful, but you can only dream about injuring me after I’m alert.”

Lin Yun squinted as his internal organs began to rumble, and the saint energy that entered his body made him feel terrible. He saw a unique layer of dipper aura around the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord, and many saint daos were in that aura.

That dipper aura was formed with saint energy and empowered with saint dao, so those beneath the Saint Realm couldn’t resolve it.

“You’re not bad for being able to withstand my attack, but how long can you last?” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord sneered. “No one can save you today, and I will kill you if you dare to stand in my way.”

All the Saints present were heavily injured, and some even lost consciousness. As for the Great Saints, they were injured and were helping the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint resist the Star Asura King and red-clothed youth.

“Why don’t you come and give it a try, then? Your palm was only enough to help me scratch my itchiness,” Lin Yun smiled fearlessly with a playful gaze. The pain was horrible in reality, but Lin Yun felt that he had to endure it no matter what. He didn’t have any odds of winning against the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord, but he couldn’t just give up after losing his momentum.

The Dao Yang Holy Son, the Golden Guards, and the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord were also confused.

“Ye Qingtian, don’t put up a strong front!” the Dao Yang Holy Son said.

But Lin Yun merely stood with his hands behind him, and smiled, “Relax. Watch how I kill you, old fart!”

“A mere Quasi-Saint like you wants to kill me? I can kill you with one hand!” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord couldn’t hold back any longer and dashed forth. He refused to believe that Ye Qingtian could inflict injuries on him with the saint energy protecting himself. After he was on alert, all Lin Yun’s Astral Sword Intent could do was help him scratch an itch.

“Let me tell you that a Saint cannot be humiliated!” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord came before Lin Yun, reaching out and wanting to crush him with a grasp. Even if Lin Yun possessed an Azure Dragon Divine Physique, everyone beneath the Saint Realm were mere ants in the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord's eyes.

Lin Yun might seem carefree, but he had a series of plans and allowed the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord to approach him. When the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord reached a position that he couldn’t dodge, Lin Yun finally made a move and reached out, unleashing the Black Thunder Chains.

Nine chains flew out from his palm; this was the first time all nine chains had left his body. The nine chains immediately formed a restriction around the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord.

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord was only half a step away from Lin Yun, but the chains wrapped around him, and the thunderflames on the chains began to ignite the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord’s saint energy. This looked terrifying but it couldn’t pierce through the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord’s saint energy.

“This is your trump card?” Surprisingly, the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord had no shock or panic on his face, and he even wore a smile. He guessed Lin Yun must have a trump card since he looked so confident. A trump card would only be intimidating if it wasn’t used. But it would be another story once it was used.

“A Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact!” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord smiled. “This is a treasure. If this is in the hands of a Saint, I can only be at your mercy. But it’s a pity you’re not a Saint; this treasure is now mine! Hahaha!”

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord looked excited because the Black Thunder Chains would only be a waste in Lin Yun’s hands. But before he could finish smiling, the chains came to life and turned into nine lightning serpents that bit down at nine locations, and one serpent bit on his lips.

“ARGH!” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord screamed because it was too painful. The serpents tore apart his saint energy and bit onto his flesh.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun responded quickly as he kicked the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord, sending him flying away.

The moment the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord landed on the ground, he let out a roar as he broke free from the chains. He was furious and no longer intended to subdue the Black Thunder Chains. He ferociously looked at Lin Yun.

“I’ll kill you!” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord roared as what happened earlier was too embarrassing.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I’ve been waiting for you.” Lin Yun was prepared. When the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord moved, he took out the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads, chanting the mantra as the beads shone brightly.

A miniature monastery appeared in the air with boundless Buddhas and Bodhisattvas reciting the mantra together to empower the beads. When the scriptures on the beads were activated, the thunderous rumbles overlapped. When they reached the limit that Lin Yun could bear, he lashed out the beads like a whip, slamming against the incoming Horizon Hawk Saint Lord.

This broke apart the saint energy around the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord, and the huge impact injured the latter. The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord threw a mouthful of blood and fell onto the ground. When he got back up aftrr some struggle, he raised his head to see Lin Yun looking at him calmly with a faint smile as though he was mocking him.

The Dao Yang Holy Son and saint disciples of the Nether Orchid Courtyard were dumbfounded because Ye Qingtian was too much of a show-off. He even dared to show off before a Saint Lord, but they found nothing wrong.

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord’s injuries weren’t serious, but he didn’t look like a graceful Saint Lord.

“A Saint cannot be humiliated? You don’t seem so impressive after all.” Lin Yun smiled as he stood before Bai Shuying. He looked calm and composed, as though he had control of the overall situation.

“You seem to have a lot of Glory Saint Artifacts. So let me see how many Glory Saint Artifacts you actually have!” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord was furious because he never expected Lin Yun to take out two precious Glory Saint Artifacts that even a Saint might not possess.

But the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord was prepared this time and was confident about suppressing Lin Yun even if the latter had another Glory Spirit Artifact.

“You think that only you have a Glory Saint Artifact? I have one as well!” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord charged over and threw out a saint cauldron. As the glory spirits were activated, a powerful saint aura swept out as he threw it at Lin Yun.

Facing a Glory Saint Artifact controlled by a Saint, Lin Yun smiled as he took out an ancient umbrella. When the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord saw the umbrella, his heart skipped a beat, and he had a bad premonition.

But it was too late as a boundless power swept out from Lin Yun’s chest, looking like a sun had appeared in the world with heaven and earth collapsing.

Lin Yun held onto the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and swung it at the incoming cauldron with a domineering aura that forced the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord’s pressure back. The umbrella was like a sword as it pierced through the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord’s saint energy, stabbing into his body.

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord screamed in pain as he broke a few ribs. As Lin Yun held onto the umbrella like a sword, he hovered in the air.

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord had disbelief in his eyes, and he yelled, “A Sovereign Saint Artifact! W-Who the hell are you?!”

“I have slain a Saint Lord while being at the Dragon Pulse Realm. So, who do you think I am?” Lin Yun looked at the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord coldly. Before the latter could be shocked, he stabbed the umbrella even further into his body as an immense power gushed out from the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

This made the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord throw out a mouthful of blood as he was sent flying away. When he fell onto the ground with one knee, he had shock reflected on his face.

Lin Yun stood with the umbrella in his hand, and he gave up pretending after using so many trump cards in his hand. He then immediately cancelled the Divine Tortoise Transformation, restoring his initial appearance and revealed a handsome and ethereal youth before everyone. The purple mark on his forehead only added a devilish temperament to his features.

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord was shocked, and everyone else on the plaza was dumbfounded.

“I am Flower Burial, burying flowers and people alike!” Lin Yun recited as he raised the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.
