Chapter 2303 - Nirvana Dao!

“If I want to grasp Nirvana Dao, I must find it in the Sword of the Beginning…” Lin Yun soon had a plan. He had about six days before the sky turned dark in the outside world.

Lin Yun planned to use two days to consolidate his divine physique and sword canons before spending the remaining time on Sword of the Beginning. He was already so familiar with it that he couldn’t improve it further.

The first was the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, where he was only half a step from condensing the divine rune. When the divine rune was formed, he would progress to the next step and form the complete dragon’s soul.

The Azure Dragon Divine Rune had nine stages, mainly consisting of the Dragon’s Body, Dragon’s Soul, and Dragon’s Aura. He couldn’t make a breakthrough in the Great Profound Sword Canon anytime soon and he had already reached the ninth stage with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, reaching a bottleneck.

“It’s still a little messy. It would be good if I could master them and turn them into a cultivation technique,” Lin Yun muttered. He couldn’t help laughing when he was done speaking. These were dragon spirit martial techniques from ancient times, and one could become a deity if the Heavenly Path was still around. But if he wanted to master them completely, it would be something not even an ancient deity could accomplish.

“Let’s stabilize my foundation before grasping Nirvana Dao!” Lin Yun soon submerged himself into his cultivation.

When two days passed, a dragon’s roar could be heard from beneath the Phoenix Tree. Lin Yun gave off a terrifying dragon aura with a dragon’s soul gradually forming in his sea of consciousness.

At the same time, there was a rune on his chest that was filled with a violent beauty. When Lin Yun clenched his fist, a terrifying power spread from the Azure Dragon Divine Rune to his five fingers. But the dragon’s soul was even more terrifying since it could grow with the number of divine runes.

It would be easier for him to face those who were proficient in using mental energy in the future. This meant that Heavenly Spiritualists were less threatening to him now. But his excitement was short-lived and Lin Yun soon tossed it to the back of his mind. He clenched his fist, and muttered, “Nirvana Dao!”

While Lin Yun was focused on his cultivation, the Last Sky Great Saint and two Saint Sovereigns were gathered in a luxurious palace, respectfully standing before a person. That person sat on a phoenix throne, looking young, and gave off a noble air.

This person wore a white robe that was decorated with golden threads and a crown. This person was the master of Divine Phoenix Mountain. After hearing the report from the Great Saint and two Saint Sovereigns, he said, “So, you guys have acknowledged his strength?”

“Yeah. Calling him Flower Burial Sword Saint wasn’t a form of courtesy,” the Last Sky Great Saint said.

The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign said, “We’re not too sure about that ‘Heavenly Slaughter Empress.’ She seemed fake, but the aura that she gave off felt real.”

“Okay.” The holy master said. The Last Sky Great Saint and Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign said nothing else, while the Astral River Saint Sovereign looked anxious.

“Xinghe, do you have something to say?” The holy master asked with a smile.

Astral River Saint Sovereign nodded and said, “Since you have acknowledged him, why don’t you go look at him and explain the matters about the Heavenly Slaughter Empress?”

Among the three, the Astral River Saint Sovereign had a close relationship with Lin Yun, forged in the Heavenly Void. After all, Lin Yun had saved his life, which the Astral River Saint Sovereign kept in his heart.

The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s holy master smiled, “You’re saying that I’m neglecting him?”

The Astral River Saint Sovereign had no change on his face, but continued, “No, but since you’ve invited him over, I feel that you should welcome him.”

The moment he said that, the Last Sky Great Saint and Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign turned to look at the Astral River Saint Sovereign as if he was being disrespectful. The Last Sky Great Saint said, “He’s a junior. It’s not because the holy master doesn’t want to meet him but he's only just arrived.”

The holy master smiled, “Xinghe, you’ve misunderstood me. I don’t dare to neglect him. I want to wait a few more days for him to settle down before meeting him.”

When he said that, the faces of the Great Saint and Saint Sovereigns changed with surprise.

The holy master stood up and continued, “I invited him over because I’m curious as to where he got those scores, including the Phoenix Heart Song. After all, it was long lost in Divine Phoenix Mountain. But when I received your news, I had another thought and couldn't simply treat him as a junior.”

The Astral River Saint Sovereign asked, “Holy Master, you’re saying…?”

“Perhaps he can accompany Xi’er,” the holy master said.

The Last Sky Great Saint was briefly stunned, before he exclaimed, “Holy Master, will you take him in as your son-in-law?”

“Hahaha!” The holy master laughed a brief moment later. He continued, “That’s not impossible if they are interested in each other. But that’s not what I mean. I want him to accompany Xi’er. Too many people have died there, and I only have one daughter. So, I naturally don’t want her to fall while in that realm. I can trust Lin Yun, based on his personality and strength, as long as he agrees.”

The Great Saint and Saint Sovereigns were shocked, especially the Astral River Saint Sovereign. The Last Sky Great Saint frowned and said, “That’s a pretty good idea, since Lin Yun can be trusted. No one in the Radiant’s lineage has an issue with their personality. But I’m afraid the quota might not be enough, and he might not be willing to go.”

The holy master fell into deep thoughts, with his expression becoming grave. He said, “Yeah. He might not be able to come back alive if he went. So I have to know what he wants. I have already sent a letter to the Sacred Alliance before you guys returned, so a friend will pay the Divine Phoenix Mountain a visit in a few days.”

“Holy Master, I can roughly guess Lin Yun’s thoughts,” the Astral River Saint Sovereign said.

“Go on.”

“Aside from their friendship, Lin Yun has other objectives in giving the divine flame fragment to the little princess. He probably wanted to befriend Divine Phoenix Mountain. After all, the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation isn’t far away,” the Astral River Saint Sovereign said.

The holy master was calm upon hearing that, since it was as he had already guessed.

The Last Sky Great Saint said, “If that’s the case, it’s even more impossible for Lin Yun to agree. After all, he might not be able to return if he went with the little princess.”

The holy master continued, “This is also what I’m worried about. So I have to know what he wants. Xinghe, do you know why I wasn’t in a hurry to meet him now?”

The Astral River Saint Sovereign nodded, realizing that he had misunderstood the holy master. He thought that the holy master had neglected Lin Yun, but it turned out that the holy master had more concerns to consider.

“Don’t treat him as a young man or a junior, since he is now a Sword Saint,” the holy master said. “You can bring him around Divine Phoenix Mountain for the next few days and prepare some gifts for him. He has just become a Saint Lord, so he must need some resources. Remember not to be stingy; you can give him whatever Zixi can receive.”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The Astral River Saint Sovereign was shocked upon hearing that.

The holy master continued, “I’ll meet him when the Sacred Alliance arrives. It’s about time for him to take on some responsibilities.”

Within the Iris Secret Realm, an azure-clothed youth was seated beneath the Phoenix Tree, brandishing his sword. His sword trembled with thunderstorms appearing in the surrounding area. To a certain degree, the azure-clothed youth gave off a prideful temperament, enveloped in a divine radiance. He gave off a feeling that he was close yet far.

As he brandished his sword, the surrounding space would distort, with several sword rays flying out before he swung his sword. Not even space had distorted, but time did. The azure-clothed youth were naturally Lin Yun.

“Nirvana of the Beginning!” Lin Yun roared as the Azure Saint Cloth began to flutter. It felt as though Lin Yun had broken through a barrier, and he was shocked when he turned around. He saw another before him, swinging his sword and looking like a breath had reversed time.

He couldn’t come to his senses in time before the Flower Burial Sword stabbed into the other party by half an inch. After which, Lin Yun quickly came to his senses and sheathed his sword. When he landed on the ground, he threw out a mouthful of blood and took a few steps back. Lowering his head, he could see a hole in his chest with blood gushing out.

This left Lin Yun stumped because he couldn’t comprehend what just happened.

Lil’ Purple also opened her eyes from beneath the waterfall and bolted over. She took a deep breath and asked with shock, “W-What happened to you?”

Lin Yun was wearing the Azure Saint Cloth with thousands of saint runes, forming a complete spiritual array. It was so tough that not even a sixth-stage Saint Lord could damage it. But there was now a hole in it.

“I-I seemed to have grasped Nirvana?” Lin Yun said with uncertainty. Over the past four days, he had been practicing the Sword of the Beginning, also known as the Nirvana Sword Art. It consisted of a total of six sword forms, with each sword possessing hundreds of variations. He had long been familiar with them, and he wouldn’t make a mistake to injure himself.

This was why he still hadn’t recovered from what happened earlier. That wasn’t a secret technique from the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, but he had returned in time. It was only a breath, but he broke through the time restriction in that breath.

After hearing Lin Yun’s explanation, Lil’ Purple rejoiced, “Try it again!”

“Okay.” Lin Yun ignored his injuries and tried the Nirvana of the Beginning multiple times. Although his attack was terrifying, he couldn’t repeat what happened earlier.

“This is weird. How did I manage to do it?” Lin Yun muttered. After he executed it multiple times, he exhausted all his saint energy but couldn’t repeat that scene, no matter how he tried.

Lil’ Purple smiled, “There’s no need to hurry. Since you can succeed once you’ve entered the doors, there’s no issue in your direction, so you can rest now.”

Lin Yun sheathed his sword and smiled, “Now isn’t the time to rest. It’s time to do what I promised you.”

“The Sinful Fire Divine Rune!” Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up.

Lin Yun nodded and came before the Othershore Flower, before reaching out. There was a weak flame at the flower bud, which made it look even more dreamy.

“It’s going to grow its bud!” Lil’ Purple smiled, looking at the Othershore Flower.

But the Othershore Flower seemed afraid of Lil’ Purple and extracted its roots from the ground before crawling into Lin Yun’s hands.
