Chapter 971 - Re-encounter

When Lin Yun passed through the sea of flames, the path he had created disappeared. Supporting himself on the ground, Lin Yun coughed weakly as he examined the burns on his body. His meridians had suffered serious burns and his face was scorched. Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips, “How pathetic…”

When he looked around, the mysterious lady who helped him earlier was no longer seen anywhere. However, he had to thank her or else he would have revealed his trump card. After a moment of rest, Lin Yun’s eyes surged with killing intent, “Shi Xuan!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The Demonic Astral Flowers weren’t too dangerous for Lin Yun, but Shi Xuan acted with malice and disdain. Lin Yun wasn’t someone who would take this loss lying down, so he would get revenge.

“Just you wait, Shi Xuan!” Drinking a mouthful of dragon clan wine, Lin Yun more or less recovered from his injuries. This wasn’t the first time he drank the dragon clan wine without it having any effect on his cultivation.

Lin Yun only suffered minor burns from the sea of flames, so he hadn’t damaged his foundation. Ready to move on, he looked up at the gray sky with seven high towering floating islands. The islands were situated among countless palaces. Enveloped in boundless starlight, the aura coming from the seven islands had their own unique auras.

The islands were far away from each other and many people were traveling towards them. All of them were higher realm geniuses who had also passed through the sea of flames. And Shi Xuan was definitely among the crowd.

“Since he has the Glorygold Spirit, he must be heading towards the Glorygold Constellation Palace.” Lin Yun hesitated briefly and decided to head towards the Glorysun Constellation Palace first. He could look for Shi Xuan later in the Azure Dragon Palace.

The sea of flames filtered out all the weaker cultivators. So no matter which palace Lin Yun went to, the competition would be intense. Plus, the inheritances of the Azure Dragon Seven Constellations needed to be activated for the Azure Dragon Palace to appear.

There was a good chance that the seven heads were also competing in order to make the Azure Dragon Palace appear. Lin Yun just hoped that not many people would go to the Glorysun Constellation Palace. After all, he didn’t want to reveal too many trump cards before the Azure Dragon Palace appeared.

“I should go.” The effects of the wine were strong and made his internal organs burn as his origin energy recovered at a visible speed. Then again, he would go back to normal soon.

For now, he didn’t have to worry about exhausting his origin energy. He quickly pushed his Cloud Soaring Art to the limit without holding back. He was trying to make up for lost time.

An hour later, Lin Yun soared into the sky and headed towards the floating island with the Glorysun Constellation Palace. It was a city with a huge ring around it that was made of True Sun Flames. It was almost as if the city was linked to the Glorysun Star.

Lin Yun ended up landing on the blazing island that was dyed in faint gold. Although the atmosphere was filled with a blazin gaura, he didn’t feel uncomfortable.

“This is a really great place,” sighed Lin Yun. He could tell that the city was busy in ancient times. It was a shame that such a great city was ruined by an ancient battle, leaving behind ruins for the next generation to admire.

At the center of the plaza was a group of ancient palaces that looked majestic. There were also many bizarre buildings that were obstructed from view.

As he got close, he saw many people gathered together. When he showed up, he instantly became the center of attention.

“That’s Flower Burial Lin Yun!”

“He’s the underdog who killed Liu Mu and his friends!”

“I was certain that we wouldn’t run into the owners of the astral spirits or the seven heads. Why is Lin Yun here?”

“Is he that strong?”

“Don’t look down on the fact that he’s from the lower realms. It would be best for you if you didn’t provoke him. He decimated Liu Mu's group with a single punch.” Everyone present was from the higher realms, but they didn’t immediately chase Lin Yun away. If it was anyone else from the lower realms, they would have been chased away.

But with Lin Yun, no one dared to utter a single word. After all, Lin Yun had proven his strength in the Heavenly Path.

Lin Yun looked around and noticed that everyone was stopped because of the towering gate that was blocking the entrance. The mysterious palace was just behind the gate but no one dared to move recklessly. No one here was stupid enough to proceed because they could sense a dangerous aura behind the gate.

Lin Yun fell into deep thought. Not just him, but everyone felt that there was a dangerous demonic beast behind the gate. If it wasn’t a demonic beast, it could have been the restrictions left behind by predecessors. It made sense that everyone was frozen still because no one wanted to put themselves in danger.

Suddenly, a weak fluctuation came from behind the gate as if there was something breathing. This even made Lin Yun’s face change slightly with surprise because he was sure that he didn’t hear it incorrectly. All around him, everyone had suspicion on their faces because they heard the sound too.

Spreading his arms apart, Lin Yun retreated decisively. But once he retreated, the entire plaza began to tremble violently as cracks spread out. In the next second, flames erupted from the gate that sent many people flying. The flames spread throughout their bodies and couldn’t be extinguished no matter what.

Very quickly, screams filled the air as the attacked were incinerated. Suddenly, a colossal figure appeared in the gate. It was a bird covered in black feathers and enveloped with golden flames.

“Divine Firebird!” Looking at the colossal being, everyone’s faces became ugly. The Divine Firebird didn’t just possess the Golden Crow’s bloodline, but it was also a ferocious demonic beast. Although it had a trace amount of the Golden Crow’s bloodline, it was still the bloodline of the legendary mythical beast. So it couldn’t be considered an ordinary demonic beast.

The colossal bird emitted immense pressure and Lin Yun could see that it was struggling to protect its region. Instead of being ferocious, it looked old.

“Calm down! This Divine Firebird is already at the end of its life. It shouldn’t be a problem for us to kill it if we work together!”

“Kill it and enter the Glorysun Constellation Palace!” The crowd gathered together and charged towards the Divine Firebird.

But when the Divine Firebird made its move and flapped its wings, boundless flames stopped the crowd.

“I should also help out.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with flames. He could tell that the Divine Firebird wouldn’t be around for much longer. It seemed like it was around since ancient times and in the Divine Core Realm, so its beast core was probably extremely valuable. It was a good opportunity for Lin Yun.

With Lin Yun helping out, it became easier to take down the Divine Firebird. It was old, but it was still ferocious. After an hour of fighting, the Divine Firebird’s aura began to decline rapidly and the Divine Firebird was reaching its last breath. Everyone knew that it was time to finish it and even Lin Yun’s eyes flickered brightly as he prepared himself.

“Thanks for all of your effort. I’ll be taking the Divine Firebird’s beast core!” All of a sudden, a burst of laughter and a powerful aura came out of nowhere. Lin Yun turned towards the voice and squinted his eyes. It was Shi Xuan!
