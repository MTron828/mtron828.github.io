Chapter 1508 - Tian Jue (2)

Lin Yun stood beside An Liuyan, and didn’t step forth. He still doubted this mission and had no intention of exposing himself for now.

It didn’t take long for ten-odd people to step out.

Tian Jue’s gaze was indifferent as he gave off a deep and unfathomable aura. When he swept his gaze through the ten-odd people, he suddenly pushed his palm forth before they could react.

When he pushed his palm out, the surrounding air began to tremble along with the Dragon Seeking Mountain. After his palm, there were only four people still standing. As for the rest, they were all sent flying away and fell onto their knees. As for the four who were still standing, they could feel their blood boiling with fear flashing in the depths of their pupils.

“You guys dare to claim to be body-refining cultivators with only this much? Get lost!” Tian Jue indifferently said with contempt in his eyes.

His words made the faces of those sent flying away ugly before they swiftly got up and backed down.

Amongst the four still on their feet, one had a height of two meters with a cold gaze, and his name was Jin Ao. One was in his fifties, his skin was giving off a grey luster, and his name was Huang Kun. There was also an old man. He didn’t look young, judging from his appearance, but his vitality was terrifying, and his name was Chen Xiuhai. The last person was naturally Ding Lei, and he took the palm the easiest amongst the four thanks to his Demon Clan’s bloodline.

“Not enough…” Tian Jue indifferently said before his gaze fell onto Lin Yun. He then pointed out, “You, step forth!”

An Liuyan was surprised, and she replied, “Tian Jue, he’s a swordsman, and he’s not a body-refining cultivator.”

She had a mysterious background as the only woman amongst the thirteen envoys. Paired with her immense wealth, she had a good connection with many demonic cultivators, and even the envoys ranked in the top five didn’t dare to look down on her.

But it was different for Tian Jue. He continued, “If he’s not stepping forth, you will do, instead.”

“I already contributed someone.” An Liuyan said with her brows locked.

“Do you want to follow her or me?” Tian Jue turned to look at Ding Lei.

Ding Lei was straightforward and smiled with his eyes squinting, “I naturally listen to the first envoy.”

An Liuyan nearly threw out a mouthful of blood when she heard that with her chest heaving up and down because of Ding Lei’s betrayal.

After Lin Yun inwardly sighed, he stepped forth and cupped his hands together. “Lin Tian.”

He wasn’t willing to step out because he noticed that the envoys ranked in the top five had robust vitality, which meant they didn’t lack body-refining cultivators. He stepped out because An Liuyan would be forced to take the spot if he didn’t.

As for the exact situation, he would act according to the situation when the time came.

Tian Jue, not caring about An Liuyan, said, “The primary reason I called you guys is because you guys can deal with the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses. Secondly is to retrieve the saint fruits and saint elixirs. Many places in the Dragon Burial Valley will devour your vitality. I believe you guys roughly understand when I put it this way. As for your benefits, you can have a share of saint fruits and elixirs. No matter how many saint elixirs or saint fruits we come across, you guys will have a share, and it won’t be counted in the half you have to hand over after leaving the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.”

Everyone’s faces became excited when they heard that. But right at that moment, Lin Yun asked, “So, may I ask how body-refining cultivators can deal with the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses?”

Before Tian Jue said a word, the four envoys ranked in the top five turned to coldly look at Lin Yun.

“Do you think that you’re qualified to speak here?” The second envoy coldly said.

“Just listen to instructions and shut it!” The third envoy also spoke up.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word, but their attitude verified his speculation. There was something weird about this situation.

“You’ll know after you enter the Dragon Burial Valley.” Tian Jue indifferently looked at Lin Yun and waved his hand, “Give them a set of saint armor.”

Those behind him retrieved several sets of saint armor consisting of a helmet, shoulder guard, arm guard, knee guard… battle boots. Not a single piece was missing, and the saint armor could completely cover everyone.

“This Flame Dragon Saint Armor has more than 20,000 saint runes with the entire set added together. They’re on loan to you guys, and you can keep them if you perform well.” Tian Jue was pretty generous, but he soon lightly locked his brows.

“Why aren’t you putting it on?” Tian Jue asked, looking at Lin Yun coldly. The four other envoys’ faces also became ugly when they saw this scene.

“I don’t need it.” Lin Yun replied.

“Tian Jue, he’s my man. So don’t push it!” An Liuyan spoke out.

“Your man?” Tian Jue laughed. “How stupid to refuse the Flame Dragon Saint Armor. Don’t blame me when you die, then.”

Tian Jue looked at the others when everyone was prepared, “Envoys, the most valuable treasure in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm are the Divine Dragon Bones. We’re not taking them for ourselves but the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. The six other demonic sects should be heading to the valley. Since we’re all prepared, it’s time for us to set off as well.”

When everyone gathered together, they headed towards the Dragon Burial Valley. When they climbed the stairs, they could feel immense pressure from the dragon aura that was suppressing them.

After they entered the valley, their sight opened up. The ground was filled with vegetation, and ancient trees were hanging in the sky that was enveloped in clouds, making this entire place look like a celestial realm.

But the ground was covered with blood and littered with corpse remains. The surroundings were reeking of blood, reminding everyone that this wasn’t a celestial realm but a genuine forbidden zone. After all, a lot of people died not too long ago.

“The aura here… is somewhat similar to the dragon palaces.” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded beside Lin Yun’s ears, which meant that this place might also be a nirvana node.

The surroundings became darker as they went deeper into the Dragon Burial Valley. Occasionally, terrifying roars could be heard, accompanied by draconic roars that made everyone’s hearts lifted. Someone became uneasy from the roars, and that person soared into the sky, wanting to see what was in the valley's depth.

“Get down!” Tian Jue immediately roared.

His roar scared that person, causing him to fall from the sky. But just when he was about to land on the ground, a crimson vortex suddenly appeared in the air. The crimson vortex was like the jaw of a ferocious beast. When the crimson vortex closed, only a decapitated head fell and rolled on the ground.

The eyes of the head were wide open, and this scene made everyone’s scalps numb. Tian Jue snickered, “I forgot to tell you guys that this place is filled with those crimson vortexes. So don’t blame me if you die because you don’t heed orders!”

Looking at that decapitated head and hearing what Tian Jue said, many people instantly intended to back out from the Dragon Burial Valley.

“Don’t bother having other thoughts after entering the Dragon Burial Valley. You guys can only dream about going back without me leading the way!” Tian Jue coldly said.

When everyone turned back, the scenery behind them had changed, and the Dragon Seeking Mountain was nowhere to be seen. It even gave them the feeling that the space here differed from the Dragon Seeking Mountain.

A voice resounded beside Lin Yun, “Brother Lin, what’s that crimson vortex? Is it a spatial crack or a demonic beast?”

The one who asked was the traitor, Ding Lei. The five body-refining cultivators were arranged together by Tian Jue, and they stood in front of the party. Further ahead were the envoys ranked in the top five leading the way.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
