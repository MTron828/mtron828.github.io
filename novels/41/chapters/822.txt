Chapter 823 - Confrontation!

Lin Yun’s dragon projection looked extremely vivid as every single scale shined brightly.

“Lin Yun is really strong. His dragon projection is the brightest so far.”

“What’s the use of having the brightest dragon projection? Only the last one standing is the winner.”

“That’s right. In the end, all of his profound amber aura will go to the three kings.”

“You guys act like Lin Yun will lose. Anything is possible as long as he perseveres.” Although Lin Yun’s dragon projection was the brightest, no one thought it mattered. After all, everyone, including his supporters, thought he would lose to the three kings.

The next battle was between Zhao Wuji and Jiang Ziye. Her loss to Yu Haotian had impacted her greatly, but she was able to alleviate some of her injuries through pellets. Unfortunately, the pellets weren’t enough for her to reach her best state. She also revealed many of her trump cards, causing her to lose to Zhao Wuji.

“Next battle, Yue Weiwei VS Yu Haotian!” Once the judge finished speaking, Yu Haotian appeared on the stage in a flash. Although the judge’s voice wasn’t loud, everyone heard him clearly. They all remembered how Yue Weiwei embarrassed Qing Ruoyou and the Indigomoon Elysium greatly. Her actions forced Yu Haotian to break the rules and interfere with the battle. If he wasn’t the champion of the previous banquet, he surely would have been punished by the Sacred Alliance.

Yu Haotian’s face was completely black and everyone could sense his killing aura when he saved Qing Ruoyou. Now that he got to fight Yue Weiwei, he wouldn’t go easy on her.

“Princess, give up on this battle.” The Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s pavilion master transmitted his voice to Yue Weiwei. He knew that a genius like Yue Weiwei from the ‘bigger world’ had to seal her cultivation to come to a lower realm. She was still getting used to the rules and regulation of spiritual energy in the lower realm. Yue Weiwei hadn’t spent much time in the lower realm, so she was lacking when compared to the genuine geniuses.

Lin Yun wasn’t too worried because he knew that it wouldn’t be difficult for Yue Weiwei to surrender. He also knew that her only goal was to make the top ten and that she wasn’t interested in rankings.

Yue Weiwei appeared on the stage in a flash and faced Yu Haotian. Seeing that the two participants were on the stage, the judge announced, “Begin.”

It was just as everyone had expected. The moment the judge announced the beginning of the fight, Yue Weiwei immediately spoke, “I admit…”

But before she could finish her sentence, Yu Haotian attacked. He had used the Overlord Fist right from the start, which shocked many people. How could he use such a powerful attack right off the bat?

The world began to spin in Yue Weiwei’s eyes. It was hard for her to breathe, let alone finish her sentence. Her face changed as she tried to leave the stage.

“You think you can escape?” Yu Haotian snorted and threw another punch. Before this punch, heaven and earth seemed to have shattered.

The impact of Yu Haotian’s punch made Yue Weiwei’s lose color as she went flying through the air. This scene made Yan Long’zi’s eyes light up with a smile as he spoke, “Allow me.”

Before the elders could react, he flew towards Yue Weiwei. When the spectators saw this, their eyes flashed with disdain.

Yan Long’zi was fast, so he reached Yue Weiwei in mere seconds. Unconcealed lust filled his eyes as he greedily reached for her waist. But right at this moment, an azure figure appeared before him and caught Yue Weiwei.

Yan Long’zi’s smile instantly froze. When he raised his head, he saw that Lin Yun was holding Yue Weiwei in his arms. Yan Long’zi’s mind exploded as his face turned green.

“You’re courting death!” Stomping his foot on the ground, Yan Long’zi charged towards Lin Yun and barked, “Release my junior sister!”

“Oh, you have a movement technique that you can use in mid-air?” Lin Yun swept a glance at Yan Long’zi before he executed his Cloudsoaring Art. When he tapped his foot on the ground, ripples spread out like water throughout the air. Tapping his foot three times, Yan Long’zi missed Lin Yun and landed on the surface of the water helplessly. At this moment, he was giving Lin Yun an evil stare.

“You won,” said Lin Yun as he looked at Yu Haotian.

“Put her down. The battle isn’t over,” said Yu Haotian with cold eyes. He had no intention of letting Yue Weiwei go. Then, he released the aura of his Overlord Fist.

Yue Weiwei’s complexion was weak as she rested in Lin Yun’s embrace like a little cat. She suddenly recalled a memory of Lin Yun carrying her and jumping into the Yin Wind Stream about two years ago. Back then, Lin Yun carried her and ran without turning back. That foolish young man hoped with all his might that he could save her. This time around, Lin Yun had no fear on his face.

“You already won,” said Lin Yun as his boundless sword intent manifested into an azure dragon that roared at Yu Haotian’s incoming aura. Yu Haotian’s aura was forcibly stopped by a brilliant sword hum.

Many people were shocked because no one expected that Lin Yun would stand against Yu Haotian for Yue Weiwei’s sake. It felt like a fight would break out at any moment.

“You already won, Yu Haotian,” said the Sacred Alliance’s judge.

“According to the rules, she neither surrendered nor left the Nine Dragon Lake,” replied Yu Haotian. Clearly, he had no intention of letting Yue Weiwei go.

“Did you forget that you interfered with the rules earlier? Flower Burial Lin Yun has the same qualification that you do to interfere,” said the judge coldly. The judge wasn’t wrong because only the strong could make the rules. Coincidentally, Lin Yun had proved his strength throughout the tournament.

The judge’s words caused a huge commotion because he was putting Lin Yun and Yu Haotian at the same level.

Yu Haotian smiled from anger and looked at Lin Yun coldly, “The might of the Sacred Alliance has really declined since they dare to place someone like him at the same level as me. Alright, I won’t pursue this matter anymore. We’ll see who is right after the rankings are set. I, Yu Haotian, am a reasonable person.”

“Thank you, senior.” Lin Yun bowed lightly to the chief judge.

“No need to thank me. I’ll have to depend on you to maintain my face.” The judge smiled bitterly and everyone could tell that he wasn’t really confident. If Yu Haotian was determined to slap his face, there was nothing he could do. Rather than thinking that Lin Yun was comparable to Yu Haotian, the judge was optimistic about Lin Yun’s potential.

“I’ll do my best,” smiled Lin Yun as he headed towards the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s seats.

He put Yue Weiwei down and turned around to leave. But just when he was about to leave, Yue Weiwei tugged his shirt and looked at him pitifully, “Big Brother Lin, don’t leave. Sit with me please.”

Lin Yun didn’t turn around. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to reject her if he turned around. After all, no one could resist her charm.

“Sit,” said the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s pavilion master with a darkened face.

In the end, Lin Yun helplessly sat down. At the same time, Yan Long’zi was forgotten about. He awkwardly stood on the Nine Dragon Lake and didn’t know what to do. How could he possibly stand to see Lin Yun sit with Yue Weiwei and the Heavenly Demon Pavilion?

“Yan Long’zi stay here. You’re up next,” said the judge.

“Who’s my opponent?” Yan Long’zi asked reluctantly.

“Fang Hanluo.”
