Chapter 1119 - Thunderclap Demon Sword

The last name on the scroll was Thunderclap Sword Demon Leng Aoran. He was a demonic cultivator with quite the personality in the Profound Azure Manor. Unlike other demonic cultivators who kept a low-profile, he preferred the spotlight.

Just like his name implied, he was a prideful person and would deliver a challenge before making a move. He blatantly told his opponents when he would appear. Furthermore, he wasn’t afraid of an ambush. In fact, he enjoyed when the core disciples of various sects would attack him. After all, they allowed his fame to grow and they were wealthy.

He was a sinister man with sinister schemes. There were many core disciples that died to him, which is why he was infamous.

Half a year ago, a subsidiary clan of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect received the challenge and invited Ye Ziling. But in the end, not only were several core disciples injured, Leng Aoran managed to escape from Ye Ziling. It greatly affected the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s reputation.

It was also a great setback for Ye Ziling. After all, she had just comprehended the sky sword intent back then and was very proud of herself.

“Can it be that this fellow has hidden his strength since he enjoys the spotlight? Hmm… not even the sky sword intent can trap him…” Lin Yun knew that Leng Aoran wasn’t like any of the other demonic cultivators that he faced.

Lin Yun put the scroll away. Unlike Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red, who ran away to digest the soup, Lin Yun needed to cultivate. After all, the lotus was a powerful herb stained with the blood of a divine beast.

Sitting down, Lin Yun began to circulate the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra to refine the medicinal effect within his body. As the Demonic Astral Flowers bloomed in his aura oceans, the medicinal effect from the Indigoflame Gold Lotus began to pour in. At this moment, his cultivation was increasing at a rapid speed.

Three days later, when Lin Yun opened his eyes, he let out a sign and light flashed through his pupils. He came from the lower realm, and he still had much potential to be excavated. After consuming the treasures, his cultivation swiftly went from lesser mastery to greater mastery. Then again, Lin Yun could make a breakthrough in the Empyrean Realm by continuing to refine Divine Astral Pellets if he wanted.

After all, he had already accumulated enough in the Heavenly Path, and it would go smoothly if he wanted. But there was no meaning in this because he wanted to reach the limit of Heavenly Soul Realm, the legendary limit of seven flowers. Only then would he be confident to face the top-tier geniuses who had extraordinary foundations.

“Time to head to the Lightflow Island,” muttered Lin Yun. It was stated on the scroll that the Thunderclap Sword Demon would appear on Flowlight Island next.

Flowlight Island was the largest island right after Fleeting Cloud Island. There were many local clans on Flow Light Island, so there was a large amount of wealth here.

The local clans were basically the subsidiary of the four major clans, and they would offer a large number of resources annually. So other demonic cultivators had to reconsider making a move against them as the four major sects placed great priority on those clans because of their resources. They wouldn’t even allow demonic cultivators to rob those clans.

The biggest clan on Flow Light Island was the Qiu Clan. The patriarch had cultivation in the Galaxy Stage while the elders were in the Star Stage, not to mention that they had also invited empyreans as guest elders of their clans.

So no typical demonic cultivators dared to provoke them, but the Thunderclap Sword Demon was clearly not an ordinary demonic cultivator. Half a month ago, he left a note to the Qiu Clan asking them to prepare 8,000 Demonic Astral Pellets. If they dared to refuse his request, he promised to massacre the entire clan.

8,000 Demonic Astral Pellets was an enormous sum even for the Qiu Clan, and they might not have that much if they emptied out their entire clan. Additionally, giving that much away would damage the entire clan for hundreds of years.

At this moment, the hall in Qiu Clan was filled with people from various clans. Everyone was here because they wanted the reward that the Qiu Clan promised, 1,000 Divine Astral Pellets.

It was a huge sum that surpassed what a core disciple would get from their own sect. However, the core disciples wanted something even more than the pellets. They wanted fame for defeating the infamous Thunderclap Sword Demon. Whoever managed to kill him would have their name spread far and wide in the Profound Azure Manor.

Although many core disciples were killed by the Thunderclap Sword Demon, many core disciples still came because they thought they were the chosen ones.

There were many people in the hall who were familiar with each other. Disciples from the King Suspend Palace, Thousand Crane Pavilion, and Azure Thunder Monastery were also present. Those three clans were part of the four major clans and had a much higher position than any other core disciple present.

Although the core disciples of the other sects weren’t weak and were basically in the Star Stage, the disciples of the three major clans didn’t bat an eye. The Qiu Clan’s patriarch, Qiu Lingyu, treated everyone evenly.

Their Qiu Clan was unlucky to catch the attention of the Thunderclap Sword Demon, which meant that they needed to pay a great price to make it through the ordeal.

“I’m grateful that everyone can come and help now that my Qiu Clan is in great danger.” The Qiu Clan’s patriarch cupped his hands with a smile. “I believe that the Thunderclap Sword Demon might not even dare to show up with so many geniuses here.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Haha!” The moment the patriarch spoke, a mocking voice sounded out, “Patriarch Qiu, you must be joking. It doesn’t matter how many people have come. If they’re all garbage, they’ll still be killed.”

The one who spoke was Yan Teng, the core disciple of the King Suspend Palace whose cultivation was at the pinnacle Galaxy Stage. He had a robust figure and faintly emitted a monarch aura. Anyone could tell that it was the King Suspend Art of the King Suspend Palace, and he had also cultivated it to a high level.

His words offended everyone that wasn’t from the major four clans. But the King Suspend Palace was the strongest force in the Profound Azure Manor and Yan Teng wasn’t a nobody. He was one of the top ranked core disciples in the King Suspend Palace.

It was said that his King Suspend Art had reached the fifth stage, and his aura was comparable to an expert in the Astral Stage. The Astral Stage was the last stage of the Empyrean Realm, and one could manifest their constellation at that point. Once they manifested their constellation, their strength would undergo a drastic transformation.

Since Yan Teng was comparable to an Astral Stage expert, it naturally made sense that he was so arrogant.

“That’s right.” A bald monk smiled. “If you’re not strong enough, you might be a hindrance when fighting the Thunderclap Sword Demon.”

That monk was a disciple of the Azure Thunder Monastery. The Azure Thunder Monastery wasn’t an authentic Buddhist lineage and didn’t have any profound aura from the Buddhist sects. On the contrary, they were all ominous-looking. This monk’s name was Fei, a famous figure in the Profound Azure Manor because of his physique.

The core disciple of the Thousand Crane Pavilion, Lei Lan, sneered, “It’s fine for you guys to stay here, but you better not have any ideas once the Thunderclap Sword Demon is dead. Naturally, that includes his treasures.”

The three seemed to have already discussed among themselves, which upset the core disciples of the other sects.

“Everyone, calm down. As long as the Qiu Clan can make it through this ordeal, we’re willing to take out 500,000 Astral Pellets and 500 Demonic Astral Pellets,” said the Qiu Clan’s patriarch.

His words finally made everyone calm down, but Patriarch Qiu wasn’t happy. Now, he had to fork out another 500 Divine Astral Pellets.

The three core disciples of the three major sects couldn’t be bothered because they were only here for the Thunderclap Sword Demon.

“Ha! I heard that there’s someone by the title of Flower Burial recently who might also join in on the fun. It seems like we don’t know who will kill the Thunderclap Sword Demon now!” The sects that were overlooked began whispering among themselves because they were trying to incite the three major sects.

“I heard that this Flower Burial is an expert in the sword, but he’s only used his flute so far. No one has ever seen him using his sword.”

“I heard that this Flower Burial might be a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. He’s killing the demonic cultivators who have a grudge with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect,” said another person.

“Looks like there’s no one from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Who knows, Flower Burial might show up!” Over the past month, the name Flower Burial had been making waves, so everyone was interested.

Even Patriarch Qiu was interested in this topic because Flower Burial was simply too mysterious. If Flower Burial really came to help, then the Qiu Clan might have a high chance of making it through this ordeal.

“Hmph!” Yan Teng snorted. “He just hides behind his mask. You know, all the demonic cultivators he has slain are only in the Star Stage. He better not offend me or I’ll rip his mask off and slap his face.”

“Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s Lin Yun is here to help.” Just when Yan Teng was done speaking, a voice sounded out from outside of the hall. Instantly, everyone looked at the entrance with interest.
