Chapter 1120 - Turbulence

Lin Yun’s voice instantly drew everyone’s attention, especially the attention of those who were just talking about him. Patriarch Qiu’s eyes also lit up with excitement and anticipation.

There was a high chance that Lin Yun was a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. So a cold light flashed in the eyes of the core disciples of the major sects.

Although they acted uninterested, they were filled with enmity for Flower Burial. After all, the major sects placed great importance on reputation as well as cultivation. And somehow, Flower Burial was able to accumulate great fame in just one month. He completely suppressed geniuses like them with his reputation.

There were even rumors that they wouldn’t be able to compete with Flower Burial, which greatly annoyed them. So they waited with hostility to see who exactly Lin Yun was.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to appear. He wore azure colored clothes and a sword box on his back. On top of that, he had flawless features and a purple mark on his forehead that made him stand out.

When everyone took a look at Lin Yun, they were briefly shocked by his grace. Then, weird expressions appeared on their faces before they looked at Lin Yun with disdain. They could sense that he was only in the seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

Although they could feel that Lin Yun was a lot stronger than others in the seventh soul, he was ultimately still in the seventh soul and wasn’t an empyrean. All the disciples who came here were at least in the Star Realm, so Lin Yun stood out.

When Lin Yun entered and saw many people gathered, he furrowed his brows together. He began to wonder if it was true that the Thunderclap Sword Demon killed core disciples of the various clans. But Lin Yun realized that there wouldn’t be so many people present if the rumor wasn’t true. Plus, the stronger the Thunderclap Sword Demon’s reputation was, the more Lin Yun would benefit by killing him.

Disappointment also flashed in Patriarch Qiu’s eyes, but he quickly concealed it with a smile. “So it’s a disciple from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. With that, the four major sects’ disciples are all here. Young Master Lin, please have a seat.”

Lin Yun responded with a greeting and stepped forward. But before he took a step out, a voice of mockery had sounded out, “Seat? What seat?”

Cold light flashed across Yan Teng’s eyes as he said, “Do you think you’re qualified to sit? Look at how many empyreans are here. Someone like you can only stand. Where did you get the face to sit?”

The moment he said those words, the atmosphere in the hall suddenly became tense. Everyone knew that the King Suspend Palace didn’t have a good relationship with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but they never expected that Yan Teng would stand out publicly.

Xuan Fei of the Azure Thunder Monastery sneered, “Patriarch Qiu was just being polite. Did you really think a Heavenly Soul Realm like you is worthy of sitting with us?”

Lei Lan of the Thousand Crane Pavilion raised his cup and also smiled, “Tsk, tsk. Not only did they send out a piece of trash, but they even sent out someone who’s not even an empyrean. Did you really think that Thunderclap Sword Demon is a pushover?”

Lin Yun locked his brows when he heard that because he was surprised by how hostile they were, especially the first person that spoke. With a slight change on his face, Lin Yun asked calmly, “Who are you guys?”

“Yan Teng of the King Suspend Palace!” Yan Teng snorted before he released his aura in the pinnacle Galaxy Stage.

“Xuan Fei of the Azure Thunder Monastery!”

“Lei Lan of the Thousand Crane Pavilion!” Xuan Fei and Lei Lan both grinned and looked at Lin Yun with a playful gaze. They could naturally tell that Lin Yun’s talent was terrifying and that he would be invincible if they were in the same cultivation. After all, Lin Yun’s aura wasn’t any weaker than an ordinary Star Stage.

They believed that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect sent him to broaden his experience, not to kill the Thunderclap Sword Demon. And since the three of them were here, there was no place for the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Even if Lin Yun was a genius, there was no way they would let him have an easy time.

When they spoke, everyone in the hall became quiet because they could tell that there was something going on. Clearly, there was enmity between the four major clans. After all, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was the strongest back in the day and the three other sects were too weak to compare. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Now that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had declined, the three sects naturally wouldn’t go easy on the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. The King Suspend Palace was especially cruel as they had been thinking of ways to suppress the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect to ensure that it wouldn’t regain its past position.

“So you three are from the other major sects.” Lin Yun instantly understood why they were so hostile towards him. After all, he already knew of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s relationship with the three other sects. It looks like he couldn’t stay here anymore if he wanted some peace.

Right at this moment, Patriarch Qiu smiled, “Young Master Lin, please don’t misunderstand. The Qiu Clan has no intention of looking down on the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Everyone, please give me some face and put this matter aside. Our priority here is Thunderclap Sword Demon.”

“I’ve given you face by letting garbage like them stay here. But you want me to let an ant in the Heavenly Soul Realm stay too? Are you looking down on the King Suspend Palace?” Yan Teng sneered.

“Well said, Brother Yan!” Xuan Fei laughed. “You think there’s a bargain for you not to offend both sides? If you want him here, then we’ll leave. Make your choice. Don’t blame us for not giving you any face because you’re disregarding our three sects to let an ant like him stay behind.”

“Looks like the Qiu Clan has declined. No wonder you guys are targeted by Thunderclap Sword Demon. That’s the only outcome when you treat ants in the Heavenly Soul Realm as valuable guests,” said Lei Lan.

The three of them took the opportunity to mock everyone. However, no one bothered to say anything because Yan Teng was too difficult to deal with, not to mention Lei Lan and Xuan Fei. If the three of them left, no one would have any confidence in facing Thunderclap Sword Demon.

Patriarch Qiu’s forehead was covered with sweat when he heard that and stuttered as he looked at Lin Yun, “B-Brother Lin, how would you feel if I personally visited the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect in the future to apologize for today’s matters?”

“Don’t worry. I have no intention of making things hard for you. I’m only here because of my orders. You don’t have to feel bad about it. I’ll be taking my leave now,” smiled Lin Yun. Lin Yun was enraged, but he could only put up with it right now. After all, he preferred to let his sword do the talking.

“Leave?” Yan Teng suddenly slammed on the table and startled everyone. All of the disciples in attendance began to tremble from the impact of the slam.

Lin Yun locked his brows and wondered what Yan Tengw was trying to do. When Yan Teng stood up, a cold light flashed through his pupils as he unleashed his killing aura, causing the temperature in the entire hall to drop.

“Who the hell do you think you are to come and go as you want? Do you think you’re Ye Ziling? Did I permit you to leave?” Yan Teng swept his gaze over and unleashed his aura toward Lin Yun.

Since Lin Yun’s sky sword intent was in complete mastery, he naturally had nothing to fear and merely looked at Yan Teng indifferently, “What do you want?”

“What do I want?” Yan Teng sneered, “Half a year ago when the four major sects joined forces to deal with Thunderclap Sword Demon, Ye Ziling was really arrogant. She treated us in disdain just because of her sky sword intent. I wasn’t convinced by her power, so she taught me a lesson!”

Lin Yun didn’t believe a word Yan Teng said. Ye Ziling might have a strong personality, but she wasn’t someone who would make a move on someone without any reason. It was probably because Yan Teng ran his mouth that Ye Ziling taught him a lesson.

“Back then, Ye Ziling was arrogant, relying on her sky sword intent. But it’s a pity that she still allowed Thunderclap Sword Demonto escape. He even slew some garbage core disciples of your Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Haha, that was a ruthless slap to her face. If my senior brother was there, Thunderclap Sword Demon wouldn’t even last more than three moves,” continued Xuan Fei.

It was true that Thunderclap Sword Demon had made the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect suffer a considerable loss, but that had nothing to do with Lin Yun. Since Yan Teng had a grudge with Ye Ziling, he should look for her instead. Then again, now that Ye Ziling’s sky sword intent had reached greater mastery, even an Astral Stage core disciple might not be her opponent.

Are they coming after me because they couldn’t do anything to Ye Ziling? Realizing this, rage began to blaze in Lin Yun’s heart because the three sects were pathetic.

“Back then, Ye Ziling gave me ten moves, so I’ll also give you ten moves. I won’t make it difficult for you and I’ll only use half my strength. Of course, you can also refuse…” A mocking smile rose on Yan Teng’s lips, “Kneel and kowtow three times. Admit to everyone that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect is garbage and you can leave.”

“Hahaha!” His words made the other disciples from the three major clans burst into laughter.

“Lin Yun, kneel if you don’t have the courage to accept the challenge. Our Senior Brother Yan here is a ranked genius, so it’s not humiliating to kneel before him.”

“What courage can you have? Your entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect relies on a woman.”

“If I was from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, I definitely wouldn’t have the face to stay.” The other King Suspend Palace’s disciples behind Yan Teng began to burst into laughter fearlessly.

They were certain that Lin Yun was a genius disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and that he wouldn’t accept humiliation. If he really accepted the challenge, there was no doubt in their minds that Yan Teng would destroy Lin yun in five moves.

Then again, it would also be interesting to watch a genius kneel in front of them.
