Chapter 654 - Demonic Canon? Worthless!

The fragments of the shattered azure dragon seal drifted in the air before dissolving into demonic mist and dissipating.

“You! Since when did you realise it!” Lei Yunzi had put his plan in motion fifteen years ago. Although Feng Wuhen, Bloodwolf, and Chief Leng were chess pieces that guaranteed that his plan wouldn’t fail, he still left behind the four seals. This would put those who obtained the seals under his control. It didn’t matter if it was Chief Leng, Bloodwolf, or Feng Wuhen. However, it actually failed with Lin Yun.

Lei Yunzi couldn’t help having rage burn in his pupils as a terrifying demonic aura exploded in the palace. His cold aura formed a wind that wreaked havoc everywhere it blew. This made those who felt it tremble in fear.

The Flower Burial Sword within Lin Yun’s sword box was still trembling as the violent sword intent continued to accumulate on his body. He had accumulated his xiantian sword intent in complete mastery for a long period of time, so it reached an unbelievable height. Therefore, the eerie wind coming from Lei Yunzi couldn’t affect him in the slightest.

“When did I realize it? What does that have to do with you?” Lin Yun replied indifferently. This filled Master Gu and Master Fu with fear. After all, Lei Yunzi was an infamous monster who stood at the peak of the Ancient Southern Domain. Furthermore, that was only fifteen years ago, which wasn’t very long ago.

Master Gu and Master Fu were alive during that time, so they knew how terrifying Lei Yunzi was back then. But right now, a youth was actually talking back at Lei Yunzi. They were shocked by Lin Yun’s courage.

Just as they had expected, the crimson demonic figure flew into a rage and his aura grew once more. The violent wind made Lin Yun’s clothes and hair flutter violently.

“Hand over the lass behind you and I’ll let you off. Otherwise, your outcome will be a hundred times more painful than these three pieces of trash,” said Lei Yunzi coldly.

Feng Wuhen, Bloodwolf, and Chief Leng might be in pain, but they were still alive. One had a layer of his skin ripped off, the other was tormented by the blood curse and made to scratch on his own body, and the last one had aged against his will. The three were pinnacle lesser Yin-Yang stage experts, but Lei Yunzi dealt with them easily.

“I’m sorry, but I refuse,” said Lin Yun.

The thought of handing a young girl over as a sacrifice never crossed Lin Yun’s mind. It didn’t matter who Lei Yunzi was, this was a matter of principle.

The crimson figure on the altar suddenly fluttered between light and dark as an eerie aura began to spread out. This palace felt eerie and even more suppressive upon hearing the screams of Feng Wuhen, Bloodwolf, and Chief Leng.

Right at this moment, Lei Yunzi’s aged voice sounded out once more, “Hand that girl over and I will give you all the treasures in this treasury. I might not be as strong as I was back then, but don’t cross my bottomline.”

“Bottomline?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with mockery. He was surprised that someone like Lei Yunzi had a bottomline. Raising his head, he looked at Lei Yunzi, “Then let me see where your bottomline lies. I fear no man, not to mention someone who’s already dead!”

His uncompromising nature surprised Master Gu and Master Fu. They clearly never expected that Lin Yun would speak to Lei Yunzi in this manner.

To Lin Yun, this was only natural. If Lei Yunzi still had his strength, he would’ve crushed Lin Yun to death a while ago. Right now, as long as he didn’t approach the altar or have any thoughts about the Blood-Devour Demonic Canon, there was nothing Lei Yunzi could do to him.

“How stubborn!” Lei Yunzi flew into a rage as he formed an ancient seal. Upon forming the seal, the three who were struggling on the ground suddenly started trembling. Their spiritual seals that represented the Vermillion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise, were activated.

A short moment later, they stood up as they emitted a torrential demonic aura. As the demonic aura poured into them, Bloodwolf equipped the Flamedragon Armor once more, the curse disappeared from Chief Leng’s forehead, and the surface of Feng Wuhen’s body crackled with lightning.

The aura coming from them was much stronger than before. However, their eyes were entirely black now. They stared at Lin Yun with black hole like eyes.

“My heavens, they were actually refined into demonic puppets by…”

“Lei Yunzi truly deserves his reputation to have such means despite his death. It looks like Lin Yun is going to die.” Master Fu and Master Gu had shock in their eyes.

“Do you really think that there’s nothing I can do about you? Since you don’t cherish the opportunity I gave you, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Lei Yunzi began to laugh from the altar, which caused everyone’s scalps to go numb.

“Is this all you got? How disappointing…” Lin Yun’s pupils flashed sharply. It was just as he had expected. Lei Yunzi couldn’t do anything to him personally and instead had to rely on Feng Wuhen, Bloodwolf, and Chief Leng. However, those three already lost to him. Does Lei Yunzi think that he can turn the tables around by turning them into demonic corpses? How naive. One had to remember that Lin Yun hadn’t even drawn in his sword.

“What arrogance! Did you really think that your xiantian sword intent in greater mastery is invincible? Do you know how many geniuses like you that I’ve killed in my lifetime? Die!” Lei Yunzi snorted as Feng Wuhen, Bloodwolf, and Chief Leng pounced at Lin Yun.

The death aura on them was so dense that the aura turned into gusts that blew at Lin Yun.

“Who told you that my sword intent is only at greater mastery?” Blood began to seep out of Lin Yun’s skin. Even with the Azure Dragon Enneaform—Duoform, he still couldn’t bear accumulating the xiantian sword intent at complete mastery for too long.

With blood on his face, Lin Yun looked even more sinister and ferocious. Waving his hand, the Flower Burial Sword shot out from the sword box. When Lin Yun held onto it, his terrifying sword intent at complete mastery pierced the sky.

In a split second, the torrential death aura that was coming for him was blocked ten meters away because of his sword aura. When Lin Yun drew his sword by half an inch, a brilliant sword ray lit up the sky like a blazing sun.

Under the sword radiance, the death aura was instantly riddled with holes before it began to break into pieces. As the Flower Burial Sword, which emitted a flower fragrance, streaked across Lin Yun’s eyes, it connected with his heart and started resonating with his fighting spirit.

Completely unsheathing the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun stabbed the enemies with his accumulated sword intent. This caught Bloodwolf, who had charged first, by surprise and left a hole on his Flamedragon Armor before he collapsed onto the ground.

Just after he was killed, a lightning python dashed towards Lin Yun. After being converted into a demonic puppet, the Indigoflame Thunderwhip was even more powerful in Feng Wuhen’s hands. His whip was so fast that it caught Lin Yun by surprise and the torrential lightning energy was just a short distance away from him.

But the sword in Lin Yun’s hand was even faster than the whip as he slashed out a sword ray that echoed with rumbling lightning. His sword destroyed the lightning python and the Indigoflame Thunderwhip fell onto the ground because its master, Feng Wuhen, had been split into two by the Thunderbolt Slasher.

Overlord Sword—Solar Slash!

The torrential xiantian sword intent raised two screens beside Lin Yun like a pair of wings. At this moment, Lin Yun was one with his sword. Chief Leng was torn into pieces when he clashed with the screens around Lin Yun.

Everything took place in a split second, so no one had any time to think. With that, Feng Wuhen, Chief Leng, and Bloodwolf were all killed by Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s figure reappeared as fresh blood dripped down from the Flower Burial Sword. The entire palace was silent and only the dripping sounds of blood could be heard.

“Damn it! Xiantian sword intent at complete mastery!” Lei Yunzi, who was on the altar, instantly panicked as he watched Lin Yun come towards him after killing his puppets.

The xiantian sword intent at complete mastery had shocked him, but as Lin Yun continued walking over, the boundless sword intent accumulated within Lin Yun’s body caused cracks on the altar.

“Don’t come over! I-I can swear to be your slave and hand you the Blood-Devour Demonic Canon!” At this moment, the demon that had been a ruler for his entire lifetime, was overwhelmed with fear. He was so terrified that his voice began to tremble.

But when Lin Yun was ten feet away from the altar and paused, Lei Yunzi rejoiced.

“You’re overestimating yourself too much. My inheritance comes from the Iris Sword Saint from the golden era. Not even the tomb of an empyrean interests me. In my eyes, your demonic canon is worthless!” Lin Yun took a step forward and slashed downwards. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“N-NO!” The sword was like a celestial flower as the altar and Blood-Devour Demonic Canon was reduced to ashes under Lei Yunzi’s despairful howl.
