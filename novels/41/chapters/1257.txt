Chapter 1258 - Noisy

Seeing that Lin Yun didn’t place the Azure Thunder Sect in his eyes, the ones following him immediately put distance between him and them. They were afraid that they would be viewed as Lin Yun’s companions and suffer the rage of the Azure Thunder Sect.

Only a few bold cultivators still followed behind Lin Yun. They had gotten a lot of benefits by following Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun wouldn’t even bat an eye at herbs beneath the age of one thousand years old. It was so much so that if those herbs that reached a thousand years were too ordinary, Lin Yun wouldn’t even be bothered to pick them.

But to the other cultivators, those herbs were extremely precious, not to mention there was no risk of following behind Lin Yun. Furthermore, Lin Yun also wasn’t like others, who would implicate the innocent. So it was pretty amicable when they followed behind Lin Yun. They just had to charge forth and gather all the herbs before leaving. So following behind Lin Yun was a hundred times better than competing for herbs themselves.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by the Azure Thunder Sect, nor did he care about those who followed behind him. Right at this moment, a rainbow light burst out. When Lin Yun directed his gaze over, his eyes lit up after seeing several crimson strands in the rainbow light.

“Scarlet Blood Fruit!” Lin Yun instantly recognized the fruit. This was a high-grade fruit. Although it couldn’t be considered a saint fruit, it was still very rare. It could be used to cultivate the holy spirit martial technique, and the effects were a lot higher than using true dragon saint liquid. Furthermore, it could also nourish one’s vitality and would greatly benefit the consumer’s physique.

Although it wouldn’t be of any great help to one’s cultivation, it could be sold for a lot of divine astral pellets. It was worth at least ten thousand divine astral pellets! Then again, Lin Yun could also use it even if he didn’t want to sell it. This was why Lin Yun had become excited, he finally saw a somewhat valuable fruit.

“Hey, it’s best if you don’t go there. That region is the camp of the Azure Thunder Sect.”

“Someone went there to try and steal an herb and was completely slaughtered by the Azure Thunder Sect.”

“They died in a terrible place, making that place a forbidden zone.” The faces of those bold enough to keep following Lin Yun changed when they saw that Lin Yun was interested in that Scarlet Blood Fruit.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that. The Azure Thunder Sect was really overbearing, occupying this entire territory with ten disciples and wanting everyone to give offerings to them. Not only that, they even made the biggest island in this territory into a forbidden zone.

“Forbidden zone? I like challenging forbidden zones the most.” Lin Yun smiled and flew in the direction of the Scarlet Blood Fruit.

This scene instantly made everyone take in a cold breath while being stumped.

“Let’s follow him and take a look.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Wherever the Scarlet Blood Fruit is born, there will definitely be dozens of thousand year old herbs.”

“With Lin Yun around, the Azure Thunder Sect might not come after us.” A few of the bold ones who had been following Lin Yun briefly hesitated before they chased after him.

“They’re not afraid of death?”

“Tsk, tsk. They’re really bold. That’s a forbidden zone, and no one can approach it.”

“A few people already died there, and they’ve still not learned their lesson.”

“Let’s see how they will die!”

“That person is too arrogant. He’ll die sooner or later due to his arrogance.” Several cautious people shook their heads, but they still followed after Lin Yun. However, they had made their decision not to descend onto the island and only watch from afar. They wanted to see how Lin Yun would die by the Azure Thunder Sect, and this also wasn’t the first time they had seen such a familiar scene.

Executing the Golden Crow Nine Transformation, Lin Yun spread his arms apart and soared into the sky. Before he even got close, he could smell the dense medicinal fragrance and could sense his vitality boiling. “It’s really the Scarlet Blood Fruit.”

When Lin Yun landed on the island, he stomped his foot on the ground and appeared in the region where the Scarlet Blood Fruit was born.

“This is really tiring.”

“Just what kind of monster is he? Isn’t he a little too fast?”

“We can’t catch up to him at all.” Those who followed Lin Yun were exhausted and gasping for air. Lin Yun didn’t seem to be using his top speed, but they were already so exhausted after following him and could barely catch up.

“Don’t you ants know that this is a forbidden island?” When Lin Yun landed on the ground, a female voice barked. The area where the Scarlet Blood Fruit was located, a group of people were kneeling on the ground, trembling in fear.

“Damn it, why is this a forbidden island? You guys can compete, but you don’t even let us take a look?”

“Furthermore, this place belongs to the Profound Azure Prefecture, to begin with. You guys are merely outsiders!” Those who were kneeling on the ground had grievances written on their faces. They had just arrived and didn’t know about any rules. So they rushed over the moment they noticed the birth of the Scarlet Blood Fruit, but they never expected that they would all be defeated by a woman.

“How noisy. How are you guys from such a remote place like the Profound Azure Prefecture any different from ants? You guys aren’t wrong. You guys just don’t have the qualification to take a look at a fruit of this caliber!” The woman stood on a rock, holding onto a sword. She didn’t even draw the sword, but there was a powerful aura emitting from her.

When she waved her hand, the one who spoke immediately became blind and the others were also sent flying, throwing out mouthfuls of blood and could no longer get back on their feet.

“Thundercloud Saint Sword!” Those who were following behind Lin Yun immediately retreated when they heard the guy who was blinded wailing out in pain.

“Trash is trash. I didn’t even draw my sword.” The woman smiled before her gaze fell onto Lin Yun, and she sneered, “Another one coming to die?”

When she waved her hand, a lightning sword ray flew towards Lin Yun. But when the attack landed on Lin Yun, his body began to glow and gave off a feeling of a primordial beast while he stood there, tearing the sword ray into pieces.

“What?” Everyone exclaimed and could feel their scalp going numb. Lin Yun’s vitality was too strong and he didn’t even use his origin energy to defend against the incoming attack.

This scene also left the woman standing on the rock shocked before she coldly said, “You’re the one who’s been taking the herbs in the surrounding islands?!”

The nearby cultivators were shocked because it looked like Lin Yun had long caught the attention of the Azure Thunder Sect. That also made sense. After all, Lin Yun had taken so many thousand year old herbs, and even if the Azure Thunder Sect’s disciples didn’t notice it, someone must’ve long reported this matter to them.

So if they did nothing and allowed Lin Yun to sweep all the thousand-year-old herbs, it would greatly affect their prestige.

The light Lin Yun emitted was too strong, but he didn’t circulate the Azure Dragon Saint Art, he only used the dragon runes to defend against the woman’s attack. But the vitality that circulated within his body shone brightly like a sun that lit up the surroundings.

Many people were shocked by this scene because they couldn’t believe that Lin Yun would actually be so strong, merely using his vitality to face the aura of a saint artifact. This was simply unbelievable, and even those geniuses on the Empyrean Ranking couldn’t do any better than Lin Yun.

“He’s the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s Lin Yun…”

“Ranked one on the Profound Azure Prefecture, Lin Yun.” Those who were sent flying by the woman earlier instantly recognized Lin Yun’s identity and exclaimed.

The woman had a keen sense with a cold light flashing from her eyes, before she coldly said, “You want to stand up for them?”

“Everyone in the Profound Azure Prefecture is an ant and isn’t qualified to compete or even take a look? Who said that this is a forbidden island? You?” Lin Yun questioned and the smile on his lips disappeared.

This woman relied on the fact that she came from a big sect to be unreasonable. Compared to her, the disciples of the Sword Sect suddenly didn’t seem so hateful anymore. Lin Yun didn’t know those who were sent flying away, so he naturally wouldn’t stand up for them. He just didn’t like how the Azure Thunder Sect has been acting.

“Who the hell are you?” The purple-clothed woman became confused. She could sense that Lin Yun was extraordinary, and wasn’t like the other country bumpkins in the Profound Azure Prefecture.

She came from the Azure Thunder Sect and was a core disciple. Since she was a genius among the younger generation, she was bestowed a saint sword by her sect.

Even in the Ancient Barren Domain, the Azure Thunder Sect was a huge sect that was only inferior to those powerful sects. Furthermore, the Azure Thunder Sect had a shocking foundation with inheritance from ancient Buddhist sects. They produced several extraordinary geniuses and thus, showed signs of becoming a powerful sect.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word, but merely gave her a cold look. He hated how people spoke in an aloof tone, and hated how people took advantage of their strengths to bully others.

When Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art, his aura began to boil as he slowly walked towards the woman. In the next second, thunderstorms began to form in the sky.

“Stop!” The woman was terrified, but she still kept her composure and said, “Big sects like us have already divided the territories, and this is a rapport we formed before the Profound Wither Island opened. If you make your move here, you’ll be breaking the rapport. Not only will you incur the wrath of the Azure Thunder Sect, but all the big sects in the Ancient Barren Domain as well!”

She could sense that Lin Yun was strong, but she didn’t believe that Lin Yun would dare to make a move because the Azure Thunder Sect was powerful. So even if Lin Yun had a strong talent, he had to consider it well before making a move.

“Rapport? What rapport?” Lin Yun locked his brows together. Did the big sects join hands together? If that was the case, then it would be troublesome because killing one would offend all the big sects. But thinking about it again, it didn’t seem to be that troublesome.

“The powerful sects have divided of the ten islands, and the remaining islands were all taken over by the big sects. This means that the herbs produced by those islands would belong to the sect who have control over that island,” said the woman.

“So this is the ‘rapport’ you’re talking about.” Lin Yun was disappointed because he thought that the big sects really joined hands together. But that didn’t seem to be the case.

Seeing the changes on Lin Yun’s face, the woman thought that Lin Yun was afraid and waved her hand. “Not only this island, but all the nearby islands belong to our Azure Thunder Sect. We’re benevolent and allowed others to compete for the herbs found in the surrounding islands aside from the forbidden islands as long as they give offerings to us.”

Her words were calm, but Lin Yun could hear the pride in her words, as if making an offering to them was their benevolence.

“Then you’re really benevolent.” Lin Yun continued to step forth with mockery flashing in his eyes.

“Stop! Take one step further and you’ll make yourself an enemy of the Azure Thunder Sect!” The woman barked, seeing that Lin Yun was still heading towards the Scarlet Blood Fruit.

Hearing that, Lin Yun stopped and merely looked at the woman.

“What are you trying to do? Didn’t you hear what I said? This island belongs to the Azure Thunder Sect, and all the herbs found here belong to us. Don’t push it!” The woman said with her face turning ugly. She had already made it so clear, but Lin Yun still wanted to take a step forth. This was an act of disregarding her. After all, even the powerful sects have to give some face to the Azure Thunder Sect. Since when had she seen an ant who dares to be so fearless and unreasonable?

“You’re really noisy.” Lin Yun was finally annoyed and his aura began to rumble within his body. As light shone from his body, thunderstorms roared that made the sky turn dark.

“Y-You dare to scold me?” The woman’s face changed with disbelief. She couldn’t believe that she was actually being reprimanded by a nameless person. After all, one must know that she had an aloof position even in the Azure Thunder Sect. She had been the focus of attention wherever she went, and even geniuses of the powerful sects were polite to her.

So since when has she suffered such humiliation before?

“Noisy!” Just when she was about to blow, the ground began to tremble as Lin Yun waved his hand. As a violent gale accompanied by lightning blew forth, the surrounding atmosphere trembled.

“Since you’re provoking the Azure Thunder Sect, you’re courting death!” The woman became enraged and held onto her saint artifact. When she drew her weapon out, a brilliant sword ray shone, emitting a powerful aura.

But Lin Yun’s azure dragon aura was a lot stronger. Before the woman could fully draw her weapon, she was directly sent flying back with blood dripping from her lips. It was as if she took a slap from Lin Yun, and the sound left all the cultivators who rushed over to have a great change on their faces.

After all, this woman had an extraordinary position in the Azure Thunder Sect, not to mention that she even had a saint artifact as a weapon. But she was sent flying by Lin Yun with a slap? This was simply too unbelievable to them.
