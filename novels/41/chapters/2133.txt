Chapter 2134: Invincible Sword Immortal

A terrifying ominous aura erupted from Fang Haotian and crashed against the barrier, enveloping the dragon mountain. Everyone could see that the baleful aura he gave off was like tentacles spreading out from him.

A demonic vine began to spread out beneath Fang Haotian. The demonic vines were giving off a crimson radiance and bright like the stars. Fang Haotian practiced the ominous and massacred daos, grasping the greater dao, Fire Dao. As he hovered in the air, he released a terrifying aura that made the entire True Dragon Path tremble.

“Fang Haotian is arrogant, but he doesn’t look down on Ye Qingtian. It looks like he has no intentions of holding back.”

“I heard that Fang Haotian once fought a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase, surviving the attack of his opponent’s sacred flame. I wonder if that’s true.”

“His baleful aura is weird, and it originates from an ancient demonic martial technique, the Heavenly Demon Heart-Devouring Hand. It has the same origin as the Heavenly Demon Saint Canon.” The Radiant Snow Saint Clan’s Ye Xuan sneered, and said, “Ye Qingtian is too cocky. Let’s not mention if he can fight three opponents by himself; it would be an issue if he could win one. After all, geniuses on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking who grasped the greater dao might not fear Ye Qingtian before he reached the Quasi-Saint Realm, not to mention that they are at the Quasi-Saint Realm. So Ye Qingtian will pay the price for his arrogance!”

Lin Yun had no fear as he faced Fang Haotian beneath the Dragon’s Head, and he even had the mood to look at Xiao Hongfei and Mo Li. He had a clear mind and knew that these people wouldn’t fight him one-on-one, so he had to take precautions in advance.

“Die!” A cold roar broke the silence as Fang Haotian raised his hand, unleashing a crimson hurricane. As the flaming hurricane roared, it became terrifying under the Fire Dao that devoured Lin Yun in the blink of an eye.

This finally made Lin Yun feel some pressure, and this person was at least twice as strong as the Whiteclothed Venerable he previously fought. But Lin Yun snorted, “You want me to die? I’m afraid you don’t have the strength to accomplish it!”

Lin Yun was calm as he unsheathed his sword. As he raised the Flower Burial Sword, he activated the Azure Dragon Sword Heart with his silver radiance enveloping a hundred feet of radius, mimicking the Thunderstorm Sword Intent that tore apart the incoming crimson hurricane.

“I have just begun!” Fang Haotian sneered. As he dashed forth, he empowered himself with his greater dao. His Massacre Intent began to grow under the empowerment of saint dao, reaching the sixth-grade martial intent. He grasped the Massacre Intent that was comparable to the sixth-grade sword intent. So, under the empowerment of his saint dao, it immediately formed into a crushing advantage.

Fang Haotian wanted to crush Ye Qingtian’s sword intent and trample on him. Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Domain soon shattered under pressure along with his sword intent, which was all within Fang Haotian’s expectation.

“Hahaha! Is this the best you have? Kneel!” Fang Haotian laughed, feeling that Ye Qingtian was at a dead-end as a hand appeared above Lin Yun, forming into a demonic claw that would slam on top of him. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The lamp in Lin Yun’s dream ignited again with a single thought. His sword intent and silver sword radiance exploded with a more powerful momentum.

“Withered Tree Coming To Life!” Lin Yun drew his sword and executed the first form of the Divine Firefly Sword. As Lin Yun performed his sword technique, a towering tree rose to the sky, with each leaf shining brightly like a bright star. This was Lin Yun’s sword, and everything could be used as a sword.

“Not good!” Xiao Hongfei’s face changed as he turned into a crimson light, charging forth with his blade.

“Heavenly Star Annihilation Slash!” Xiao Hongfei unleashed a blade ray that descended with the demonic claw.

But the blade ray was destroyed by Lin Yun’s Flower Burial Sword, with crimson petals flying out. Even the demonic claw began to crumble. Even when the two joined forces, neither one could withstand his sword, and Lin Yun unleashed two sword rays that left a horrifying wound on them. When Lin Yun turned around mid-air, he wielded his right hand and descended.

As he raised his head, Fang Haotian and Xiao Hongfei were bleeding from their wounds. Their wounds were created with Astral Sword Intent. So Fang Haotian and Xiao Hongfei couldn’t heal their wounds anytime soon with their saint aura. But that wasn’t the end as Lin Yun formed a seal with his left hand, and the petals in the sky exploded with Fang Haotian and Xiao Hongfei flying back. The powerful impact made the True Dragon Path tremble when they landed on the ground.

“Divine Dragon Elite Ranking’s geniuses don’t seem so impressive after all,” Lin Yun said indifferently with his two hands behind him. But his words were like a pebble tossed into the lake, causing violent ripples. Many people were waiting to see Lin Yun make a joke out of himself, but they were dumbfounded after seeing how he defeated Fang Haotian and Xiao Hongfei.

“One sword?”

“Isn’t this too exaggerated? His sword intent was clearly destroyed, so how did it revive?”

“This is the grace of a swordsman?” Many people noticed this battle, and they could sense the power of that sword even from so far away.

“Holy shit! Almighty Senior Brother Ye!”

“Ye Qingtian is invincible!” The Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples who came to observe cheered with their blood boiling. Many saint disciples’ eyes lit up when they saw Lin Yun’s performance, and their impression of the latter changed. Even some female disciples’ eyes shone brightly, and they now knew why Ye Qingtian was known as the Holy Maiden Killer.

“Let’s go at him together! Don’t hold back!” Mo Li snorted. As Mo Li, Xiao Hongfei, and Fang Haotian soared, they sealed off Lin Yun’s path and searched for the latter’s flaws. As a boundless saint aura exploded from them, their Quasi-Saint auras combined with their greater daos.

Their indigo saint aura filled every corner, forming an indigo ocean with their saint auras reaching an unimaginable height.

“Holy shit! He’s really fighting three opponents by himself!”

“Not only is he fighting three opponents, but his opponents even linked their saint auras and greater daos!”

“This is just the True Dragon Path. Aren’t they too shameless?”

“Who would talk about fairness with you? This is the Blue Dragon Record, so everyone will naturally compete with each other.”

“Suppress him immediately, and don’t compete with him in regards to martial intent. His sword technique is too terrifying!” Mo Li said as he tossed the Heavenly Note Bell out. Fang Haotian and Xiao Hongfei immediately injected their greater daos and indigo saint auras into the bell.

Mo Li knew that both sides would suffer terribly if they carried on fighting Ye Qingtian. Ye Qingtian’s attainment in the sword was too high, and he could bring the height of a martial technique to a height incomparable to others. He could use an ingenious way to resolve the incoming attack, killing enemies with higher cultivation than him. So they could only use their dao to destroy Lin Yun’s sword aura.

While the three empowered the Heavenly Note Bell together, Lin Yun poured his sword intent into the Flower Burial Sword, activating the two glory spirits before slashing at the Heavenly Note Bell. When the sword and bell clashed, Lin Yun took a few steps back to stabilize himself. He said, “Looks like the Falling Note Mountain has some tricks up their sleeves.”

“Is this fellow still a human?” Mo Li’s heart trembled because Lin Yun wasn’t injured from the clash.

As the bell echoed, a soundwave struck Lin Yun’s soul as the bell came again. Lin Yun didn’t dare look down on this attack and began executing the Divine Firefly Sword.

“Withered Tree Coming To Life! Rising Sun! Polar Opposite! Flaming Floral Silver Tree! Driving Lightning!”

Lin Yun soon executed the Divine Firefly Sword in the manifestation stage. This sword couldn’t be tracked, and the phenomena had disappeared. There weren’t any phenomena created by Lin Yun’s Divine Firefly Sword, but formed into a loop, striking the Heavenly Note Bell. His attacks were like an endless water flow, and he exchanged a hundred moves with the Heavenly Note Bell. Not only was Lin Yun not in a disadvantageous position, but his sword technique shone even more brightly instead.

The water flow was the sound of a greater dao that overwhelmed the sound from the ancient bell, leaving everyone stumped.

“What sword technique is that? Why can’t I recognize it?”

“It’s the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword, but all the phenomena have disappeared. He has combined all the profundities of the sword technique!”

“How is that possible?” All the cultivators outside the Nine Dragon Mountains were shocked with disbelief. The thirteen sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword contained a different profundity, and it was impossible to combine it in the eyes of everyone. Many people also didn’t think it was necessary because it wouldn’t affect the sword technique much. This was because the Divine Firefly Sword was strong enough, especially since the last three swords were ultimate attacks.

But what they saw overturned their perspective of the Divine Firefly Sword. Lin Yun’s sword was so powerful that everyone’s forehead was sweaty. They finally knew what a real swordsman was!

Mo Li, Xiao Hongfei, and Fang Haotian wanted to destroy Lin Yun’s sword aura but were horrified to discover they couldn’t accomplish it. No matter how many times they crushed Lin Yun’s sword aura, the latter could restore his sword intent.

A lamp was hovering in the sky in a special space, and the fire wouldn’t extinguish no matter how powerful the wind was.

“That’s the Astral Sword Intent at the pinnacle of complete mastery?” Many cultivators’ eyes shone brightly and were shocked. Ordinary people would be shocked by Lin Yun’s sword technique, but the experts were shocked by Lin Yun’s sword intent.

“Flowing Time! Planting Soldiers!” Lin Yun executed the last two sword forms as he divided them into two, and the power of the two swords overlapped. In the next second, it felt as though the sword ray released by Lin Yun could travel through time and the attention of everyone on the True Dragon Path became captivated by it.

The countless sword rays formed eighteen pillars that shattered the ocean of indigo saint aura. Fang Haotian, Mo Li, and Xiao Hongfei failed to crush Lin Yun’s sword aura and had their auras crushed instead.

When the three separated, blood dripped down their lips with shock filling their eyes.

“He’s only at the Nirvana Stage! He can’t hold on for long, so we can slowly exhaust him to death!” Xiao Hongfei said, wiping the sweat off his lip.

“Who isn’t a Quasi-Saint now?!” Lin Yun began to laugh, with his laughter echoing out. As Lin Yun laughed, he hovered in the air and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon with the saint aura within his violet palace boiling. When he was enveloped in saint aura, a terrifying Quasi-Saint’s aura swept out from all of Lin Yun’s pores.

As Lin Yun swung three swords, Fang Haotian and Xiao Hongfei flew off of the dragon mountain. As for Mo Li, he was barely holding on to the Heavenly Note Bell to protect himself and threw the bell over.

“Why bother!” Lin Yun’s gaze became cold as he slammed his left hand on the ancient bell. The ancient bell was sent flying away as the heavenly dragon and divine phoenix flew out from his body. But Lin Yun didn’t stop there and unleashed another attack to send Mo Li flying away. At this moment, Lin Yun looked invincible, which drew the exclamation of everyone.

“This is the legendary Holy Maiden Killer?” Many people couldn’t believe their eyes. How was Ye Qingtian a Holy Maiden Killer? He was simply the reincarnation of a Sword Immortal, with no one capable of standing in his way on the True Dragon Path.

Lin Yun sheathed his sword as he came before Cao Yang and Ye Ziling. He asked, “Which of you wants to become the Dragon’s Head?”

“What?” Cao Yang was dumbfounded.

“Let’s go with you then.” Lin Yun laughed as he threw Cao Yang to the Dragon’s Head.
