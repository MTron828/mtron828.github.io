Chapter 1084 - Die With Unresolved Grievance!

Torrential killing aura filled the entire Saint Spiritual Lake that left the crowd dumbfounded. Not only were the geniuses in the Heavenly Path shocked, but even the various elders were shocked.

No one in the Heavenly Path knew how strong Elder Jin Jue was, but the elders knew. Since the person who appeared was filled with demonic aura, it was clear that he was an expert from the Demon Clan who was just as strong as them.

“Him?” Lin Yun let Yue Weiwei go as he looked at the newcomer with shock. It was Chen Xun, the mysterious figure he had once met in the Azure Dragon Region.

He had seen Chen Xun several times, but he never expected him to be so strong that even Elder Jin Jue would suffer. He couldn’t see through Elder Jin Jue’s cultivation, but he had a feeling that the elder was above the Elysian Core Realm.

Yue Weiwei’s eyes started to shine when she looked at Chen Xun. “It’s Third Senior Brother! Why is he here?”

“Third Senior Brother?” Lin Yun asked.

Yue Weiwei explained, “He is my father's disciple. I snuck out in secret though, so no one should know that I’m here.”

Lin Yun didn’t reply because he could tell that this matter wasn’t as simple as Yue Weiwei thought it to be. He could tell that Chen Xun was extremely mysterious since the latter didn’t even appear in the Azure Dragon Palace.

It seemed like Chen Xun probably revealed himself to Lin Yun because he found out about Yue Weiwei’s relationship with Lin Yun. Chen Xun was probably probing Lin Yun to see what kind of person he was.

“You’re courting death!” Elder Jin Jue roared furiously and unleashed a terrifying aura from his body, which disrupted Lin Yun’s thoughts. Lin Yun squinted his eyes as he sensed Elder Jin Jue’s boundless vitality, fortune, and starlight.

As an elder of the Profound Sky Sect, he had never suffered such a great loss in the hands of a junior from the demon clan. He naturally couldn’t accept it.

But Chen Xun merely responded with a cold snort and charged forward. When the two figures clashed, a terrifying aura exploded out in heaven and earth. The ripples from the attacks were strong enough to make others feel like the world was on the verge of being destroyed.

Pulling Yue Weiwei to the side, Lin Yun watched the battle in shock. The fight was so dangerous that Lin Yun would lose his life if he wasn’t careful. Regardless of his sky sword intent or holy spirits, there was no way he could put up any resistance before them.

As for the other elders, they didn’t pay attention because a battle of this scale was common to them. On the other hand, their gazes fell onto Yue Weiwei who was next to Lin Yun.

“Heavenly Fox Clan… It looks like she’s really…” The Thunder Sect’s elder was the first to speak.

But the moment he spoke, someone interrupted him and replied, “Let’s not talk about that person’s name. This is no longer something we can interfere in, and it has nothing to do with us. This is all on Elder Jin Jue alone.”

The other elders nodded their heads in agreement.

“But what about Lin Yun?”

“It’s not easy for us to resolve this matter. Elder Jin Jue seems pretty determined to kill him. Which one of you wants to stand out? We can only wait for the Sacred Alliance to resolve this matter,” sighed one of the elders.

They came here to pick disciples, so ordinary geniuses naturally wouldn’t catch their attention. After all, there were countless geniuses in the Ancient Barren Domain. If they wanted an ordinary disciple, they wouldn’t have come here personally.

The Heavenly Path was open once every millennium, and there would always be a genius who caught everyone’s eyes. Then again, many of those geniuses fell in Kunlun Realm and only a few managed to grow up. But if they could pick one of those geniuses, they could groom them into a powerful force in the future. Then, that genius would have a chance to rise in Kunlun Realm and become a legend.

There was no question that Lin Yun was such a genius who displayed great talent. But he was too stubborn and killed five of the Realm Sons. As for the remaining five Realm Sons, they weren’t dead, but they were practically crippled. So they had to seriously consider if they wanted to recruit Lin Yun. Even those who wanted to recruit Lin Yun earlier began to hesitate.

Above the Saint Spiritual Lake, Elder Jin Jue and Chen Xun separated. Elder Jin Jue didn’t manage to gain an advantage, which made his face turn ugly.

“Looks like there’s nothing impressive about the Profound Sky Sect after all.” Chen Xun smiled.

Elder Jin Jue’s face twitched but he didn’t move. He just looked at Chen Xun coldly, “No one can save you for barging into the Heavenly Path!”

Lin Yun could see ripples spreading out in space with several powerful auras approaching. He fell into deep thoughts because the auras had to be the reason why Elder Jin Jue stopped fighting. Did the Sacred Alliance come?

The Sacred Alliance managed nine Heavenly Paths, so they wouldn’t appear unless there was something important. Crackling sounds rang out in space, and a majestic ship broke through the spatial crack. The ship was enveloped in boundless starlight and a flag with nine dragons had appeared. At this moment, everyone could feel a boundless and imperial aura.

“Since when was the Demon Clan so bold to intrude into the Heavenly Path?” A prestigious voice sounded out from the ship along with a terrifying aura that enveloped Chen Xun. Space became restricted around Chen Xun as a mini prison was formed.

“Third Senior Brother!” Yue Weiwei exclaimed with concern in her eyes.

“Don’t worry about it.” Lin Yun held Yue Weiwei’s hand so she wouldn’t be too worried. Since Chen Xun dared to appear, he must have predicted that the Sacred Alliance would show up.

“He isn’t just bold, but he’s also outrageous! He’s just relying on the fact that he has…” Jin Jue suddenly paused as his eyes flickered. He stopped himself from mentioning Chen Xun’s origin. “This person has an uncertain origin. Not only did he sneak into the Heavenly Path, but he even prevented me from performing my duties. He completely disregarded the Sacred Alliance’s existence.

Chen Xun merely smiled, “My origin is clear. Why don’t you just announce it? As for the Heavenly Path? I snuck in, but don’t bother pinning the crime of disregarding the Sacred Alliance on me. Why do I feel that it’s such a coincidence for all ten realm sons to be gathered in the Ninth Heavenly Path? The Sacred Alliance has to investigate this matter well because the ones who orchestrated it are disregarding the Sacred Alliance!”

The moment he said that the faces of the various elders changed. Everyone knew that news had gotten out that the Divine Blood Fruit would appear in the Ninth Heavenly Path before the Heavenly Path opened.

With so many Realm Sons in the Ninth Heavenly Path, there was a clear violation of rules set up by the Sacred Alliance. However, the Sacred Alliance had declined over the years, so they weren’t feared like they were in the past. Otherwise, Jin Jue wouldn’t dare to make a move on Lin Yun and Chen Xun wouldn’t sneak into the Heavenly Path.

Jin Jue’s face changed as he looked at Chen Xun coldly, “Even if you try to push the blame away, it doesn’t change the fact that you have intruded!”

“Then how are you performing your duties? Why don’t you say it out loud and let the Sacred Alliance judge?” Chen Xun smiled.

Seeing how the two argued, Lin Yun instantly figured out that the Sacred Alliance wasn’t as strong as he imagined them to be.

“Enough.” A furious voice sounded out once more from the ship. “Neither of you are allowed to interfere before the final battle comes to an end.”

The voice demanded they stop fighting. Since Jin Jue failed to achieve his goal, his face was dark. When Chen Xun saw this, he laughed and broke the restrictions surrounding him. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Without the two of them interfering, the final battle resumed. With the ten Realm Sons dead or heavily injured, Lin Yun easily occupied the core region in the Saint Spiritual Lake. No one dared to provoke him. He devoured the floral saint liquid and easily became the champion.

Although everyone was glowing purple due to the floral fragrance they had absorbed, only Lin Yun emitted a dazzling light. A prestigious voice sounded out when Lin Yun was done, “The champion has been decided.”

After that voice spoke, the elders formed seals together and a fruit slowly rose up from the Saint Spiritual Lake. Just like that, the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit that had been growing for nine thousand years hovered before Lin Yun.

Although the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit wasn’t as precious as the Divine Blood Fruit, it was better than the Divine Blood Fruit in the eyes of Lin Yun. After all, he couldn’t refine the Divine Blood Fruit or its leaves, so it was practically useless. On the other hand, the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit could allow him to increase his strength.

When Lin Yun held onto the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit, everyone looked at him. Lin Yun sensed one gaze in particular that came from Elder Jin Jue. Since Lin Yun killed the Nether Divinity Realm Son, Elder Jin Jue had to deliver the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit to Lin Yun. One could only imagine how bad Elder Jin Jue was feeling right now.

But with the Sacred Alliance here, Elder Jin Jue had to suck it up. Lin Yun suddenly felt another gaze that came from the Imperial Feather Realm Son. Logically speaking, he should’ve died when his Flame Dragon’s Heart was extracted. However, he was still breathing because of the dense spiritual energy released in his blood.

The spiritual energy was from all the treasures that he had consumed. This alone showed how strong his foundation was. In fact, it was the only reason why he was able to watch all of Lin Yun’s feats.

“This Ninth Heavenly Path is really interesting. Is no one interested in such a monstrous talent?” A sudden laughter sounded out from the ship with a playful tone.

The various elders hesitated, especially the Thunder Sect and Flying Snow Manor’s elders. However, just when they were about to make up their mind, Elder Jin Jue’s cold snort silenced their thoughts. The Profound Sky Sect was really powerful in the Ancient Barren Domain.

Lin Yun sighed inwardly. However, he didn’t care if one of the elders stood up for him because they previously cowered under Elder Jin Jue. Since they were hesitant about him, he wasn’t interested in them. Then again, he didn’t care if no one chose him.

“It seems like he caused a huge mess since no one wants to pick him. According to the rules, you have two choices. You can choose to cultivate in the Sacred Alliance for three months before finding a place to go or you can return back to the Profound Amber Realm. Young lad, you can make your choice right now.” The prestigious voice sounded out once more. But this time, the voice was a lot more gentle and sympathetic.

The other geniuses on the Saint Spiritual Lake also felt sympathy for Lin Yun because this outcome was too terrible. Lin Yun was clearly a transcendent genius, but no sect wanted him. It was the worst outcome ever for a champion in the Heavenly Path.

Elder Jin Jue wore a sinister face. It was the outcome he wanted because he was confident that Lin Yun wouldn’t choose to return to the Profound Amber Realm. So in three months, Lin Yun would leave the Sacred Alliance and then he would be able to kill Lin Yun!

Even the Imperial Feather Realm Son who was on the verge of death wore a smile. He had held a grudge with Lin Yun after his Flame Dragon’s Heart was extracted so he didn’t want to witness Lin Yun basking in glory.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son felt that he could die in peace now. So what if Lin Yun was the champion? In the end, Lin Yun would still die an even more terrible death than him.

Yue Weiwei looked at Chen Xun with puppy eyes, but Chen Xun indifferently responded, “Don’t mess around. Master only tasked me with bringing you back. He didn’t tell me to bring a man back for you. If I do that, I’ll be beaten to death.”

“Is there no place for Big Brother Yun in the massive Kunlun Realm?” asked Yue Weiwei in an indignant tone.

Although Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of the Profound Sky Sect with the Firmament Battle Cloth, this scene still made his heart cold. He was an optimistic person, but this situation still made him feel bad. Plus, he couldn’t stand the many sympathetic gazes that were looking at him. Sometimes, the heart of a person wasn’t as strong as what they showed on the outside.

“Have you made up your mind?” The voice asked again.

Despite feeling more or less normal in his heart, Lin Yun still spoke in a trembling tone, “I don’t wish to return to the Profound Amber Realm.”

“Come on then. Since no one wants you, my Sacred Alliance will keep you for three months.” The voice sighed as it gave Lin Yun the order.

Lin Yun gnashed his teeth and slowly stood up. When he swept his glance at the various elders, they avoided eye contact with him. Lin Yun merely swept a glance at them before he retracted his gaze.

But just when he was about to take a step forward, a sword hum began to echo out in heaven and earth, “Who says that no one wants this brat? My Sword Sect will take him!”

Everyone was briefly shocked when they heard the voice. Even the elders wore disbelief on their faces, especially Jin Jue who was thinking about how to kill Lin Yun in three months. He was completely taken by surprise.

Just how was this possible? The Sword Sect came to the Heavenly Path to recruit Lin Yun? Even those from the Sacred Alliance were shocked as they waited for the figure to reveal themselves.

Even the Imperial Feather Realm Son, who was slowly closing his eyes, suddenly opened his eyes with disbelief. If he wasn’t half-dead, he would surely jump up upon hearing that the Sword Sect came!
