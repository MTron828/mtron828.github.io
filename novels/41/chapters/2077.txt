Chapter 2078 - Victory!

The eight ominous beasts were kneeling on the ground, causing the entire lake to tremble. This was a shocking scene, leaving all the geniuses from the Sword Alliance dumbfounded.

“How is this possible?!”

“Oh my god, what the hell is going on? The eight ominous beasts are kneeling before Ye Qingtian?”

“Didn’t Feng Shaoyu just execute an ancient secret technique?” Everyone could feel their scalps going numb and couldn’t comprehend what was happening. Someone like Gu Zijing was so shocked that his jaw nearly dropped, not to mention Zhao Wuji.

“This… is impossible…” Feng Wuji was dumbfounded, and his face changed. He muttered, “Ye Qingtian must’ve learned the secret technique of my Feng Clan!”

Feng Wuji couldn’t maintain his composure any longer and looked as though he would make a move the next moment. But how could Feng Yu possibly allow him to do that? After she came to her senses, her hand fell onto Feng Wuji’s shoulder. Her hand was like a mountain that fell on Feng Wuji’s shoulder, causing the entire palace to tremble and everyone in the palace became uneasy.

At the same time, Feng Wuji couldn’t move under her hand.

“Now’s not the time to mess around!” Feng Wuji’s face changed. He noticed that Feng Shaoyu was nervously trying to control the eight ominous beasts, but he couldn’t regain control of the eight ominous beasts no matter how he tried.

“Big Brother, what are you trying to do? This is an official challenge, and no one can touch Ye Qingtian today, not even if the old man came. So sit down!” Feng Yu’s face became cold as she pressed Feng Wuji back into the chair.

This scene left Gu Zijing and Jiang Yunting’s mouths open as they began to wonder about this woman's origin. After all, this woman pressed Feng Wuji back into his seat with a single palm.

“Aunt!” Feng Shengling stepped forth, wanting to persuade Feng Yu.

“Go back,” Feng Yu sent a domineering glare at Feng Shengling, and ignored what he said. She began to wonder how her brother taught his children to call her aunt when so many people were around.

Feng Wuji gave up struggling and sighed, “Listen to your aunt. It’s fine.”

Feng Yu increased the strength of her hand when she heard that, causing Feng Wuji’s lips to twitch. He said, “Go back. This young lady is just messing around with me.”

Feng Yu smiled upon hearing that and released her strength. But she had no intention of moving her hand away from Feng Wuji’s shoulder.

“Don’t look at me. The outcome hasn’t been determined yet,” Feng Yu smiled.

When everyone looked away, they noticed that Feng Shaoyu’s forehead was covered in sweat with his entire body trembling, and he couldn’t comprehend what was happening. Feng Shaoyu tried his best to regain control of the eight ominous beasts.

Simultaneously, Lin Yun gradually figured something out and became calm. He grabbed onto the chains and could feel that he could control the eight ominous beasts if he wanted. He wondered if this was related to the ‘broken sword’ within his body.

He could feel an energy from the shackles trying to break free and restrict him, but this energy was obstructed for some reason. The eight ominous beasts were resisting Feng Shaoyu’s control.

“What’s going on?” Feng Shaoyu sensed that his saint aura was being consumed but couldn’t regain control of the eight ominous beasts no matter what he tried. This was simply unheard of, and Feng Shaoyu began to sweat profusely.

“Feng Shaoyu, it appears that you’ve lost control of your own attack,” Lin Yun mocked.

“Don’t be arrogant. You’re just a dead person in my eyes. No one has managed to escape the Eight Ominous Souls Locking Array before!” Feng Shaoyu forced himself to calm down.

“Is that so?” Lin Yun laughed as he tugged the shackles in his hand. He roared, “Eight ominous beasts, heed my order!”

The eight ominous beasts got up on their feet under Lin Yun’s control. The lake was torn apart when the eight ominous beasts soared to the sky. This scene was shocking, causing everyone to take a deep breath before they soared to the sky, wanting to leave this dangerous region.

The shackles shone brightly as eight energies poured into Lin Yun’s body. When the energies merged with his body, Lin Yun could feel the mysterious ‘broken sword’ being drawn by an inch, revealing half of the sword. But just when the sword was about to be fully drawn, an invisible force stopped it from being drawn any further.

The energies gathered towards the shackles in his right hand while the sword began to tremble within Lin Yun’s body. Lin Yun’s vision began to blur as a white figure appeared before him. This figure seemed so close yet so far. The white figure suddenly turned around. This person was wielding a blade in his right hand with a blue dragon behind him. When he turned around, the entire world disappeared, along with all the phenomena.

Lin Yun found himself in the starry sky as the white-clothed bladesman smiled upon seeing him. He said, “I knew you’d receive the acknowledgment of that sword one day. Even fate can’t stop it, and my blade will wait for your sword. But stop here and don’t draw it for now.”

Lin Yun had never seen this person before, but he couldn’t help feeling his heart beating violently from a familiar feeling.

A blue dragon and a bladesman? Lin Yun immediately thought of that lord who established the Divine Dragon Era. But it made no sense for him to feel a sense of familiarity with this person.

As that person gradually became blurred, there seemed to be a powerful force stopping the white-clothed figure’s appearance. Looking at the white-clothed figure gradually disappearing, Lin Yun yelled anxiously and ran, “Wait! Tell me who you are!”

The white-clothed figure was also doing his best to run over, and they held onto each other’s hands when the white-clothed figure was about to disappear.

“Hahaha! We will meet again. At that time, not even fate can stop us! Remember, don’t draw that sword out for now, and don’t ask who I am. I’ll wait for you, and my blade will always be waiting for your sword!” The white-clothed figure disappeared along with a hearty laughter as Feng Shaoyu reappeared before Lin Yun.

As Lin Yun descended from the sky, Feng Shaoyu had fear on his face as he tried to control the eight ominous beasts through the ancient seal in his chest.

Lin Yun’s attack immediately shattered the indigo saint aura around Feng Shaoyu and landed on his chest before slamming against his palm. Feng Shaoyu wanted to stop Lin Yun, but his resistance was futile because he had exhausted all his saint aura and couldn’t muster any strength to resist.

As Feng Shaoyu descended from the sky, the golden seal from his chest released a dazzling radiance. This ancient seal protected Feng Shaoyu’s life, but Lin Yun also knocked it out of Feng Shaoyu’s body.

This made Feng Shaoyu furious, but he could do nothing as he looked at the ancient seal hovering in the air while he fell into the lake, causing a splash. Everything happened too quickly and took place in just a few breaths. Feng Shaoyu was still holding the upper hand in the fight just a moment ago, and everyone also thought that the Eight Ominous Souls Locking Array would defeat Ye Qingtian.

But no one expected the tables to turn around, and Ye Qingtian suppressed the eight ominous beasts instead, defeating Feng Shaoyu with one strike. Not only that, but Ye Qingtian even dug out the ancient seal from Feng Shaoyu’s chest.

Everyone from the Hidden Sword Manor couldn’t comprehend how Feng Shaoyu lost so terribly, even after bringing out the Eight Ominous Souls Locking Array.

“I… lost…?” Feng Shaoyu laid in the lake. The thought of him losing never crossed his mind. He naturally noticed that Ye Qingtian was extraordinary. His talent might not be comparable to Ye Qingtian, but he was reluctant to become Ye Qingtian’s stepping stone. He was the young manor master of the Hidden Sword Manor. So how could he be defeated in this manner?

When Lin Yun let go of the shackles, they returned to the ominous beasts’ bodies and they bowed in Lin Yun’s direction before returning to the ancient seal. As Lin Yun hovered in the air, he waved his hand and summoned the Flower Burial Sword.

Looking at Feng Shaoyu lying in the lake, he didn’t choose to make a move but raised his head to look at the ancient golden seal instead. This ancient seal released a golden radiance and a noble dragon coiled around it.

With a wave of his hand, the ancient seal flew into his hand. He had a strong feeling that this ancient seal might be related to the ‘broken sword’ within his body, and he had a lot of questions now. Who was the white-clothed figure? Why could he control the eight ominous beasts? What would be the consequences if he drew out the ‘broken sword’ within his body?

When Lin Yun grabbed the ancient seal, Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the Iris Secret Realm, “That seems to be the Heavenly Dragon Seal. It’s no wonder why it can control the eight ominous beasts. The Hidden Sword Manor’s origin doesn’t seem to be as simple as it looks.”

“Ye Qingtian, return the seal!” Feng Wuji said with a dark expression from the palace.

A few black-clothed figures also appeared in the surroundings as they emitted a terrifying aura. The seal was clearly important to the Hidden Sword Manor, and they wouldn’t let Ye Qingtian leave with it.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun was still rational and knew this wasn’t the moment to take this seal. But just when Lin Yun was about to return it, the woman beside Feng Wuji shook her head and gave him a wink.

Lin Yun was stunned when he said, “Manor Master, you have yet to declare the outcome of this challenge.”

Feng Wuji’s face sank, and he said, “Return the seal. It has nothing to do with this challenge.”

Feng Wuji’s voice was so prestigious that it made many people tremble.

“ There’s no need to hurry. You can announce the results of this challenge first. Or is the Hidden Sword Manor planning to play tricks after coming this far?” Lin Yun asked indifferently.

Feng Wuji had no changes on his face, but he was furious because this was the first time he encountered such a bold junior.

“Give him the sword,” a voice resounded in Feng Wuji’s ear.

Feng Wuji was stunned before he said, “You’ve won this battle, so you can return the seal now. The Cauldron Sword will be given to you shortly.”

“Thank you. Here, you can have it back,” Lin Yun smiled. He did not intend to spread his palm, wanting Feng Wuji to come over personally.

“The old man agreed?” Feng Yu looked in a certain direction and saw an old man standing in a towering palace, wearing a complicated expression.

But what is with the old man’s facial expression? This piqued Feng Yu’s curiosity because this was the first time she had seen such an expression on the old man’s face. The old man’s facial expression looked complicated, shocked, baffled, and a hint of excitement.

Sensing Feng Yu’s gaze, the old man regained his composure and left.

“Third Younger Sister, everyone is looking at us. What am I supposed to do with your hand on my shoulder?” Feng Wuji lowered his voice, his face becoming red.

Feng Yu was stunned and smiled, quickly letting go of Feng Wuji, “My bad, my bad.”
