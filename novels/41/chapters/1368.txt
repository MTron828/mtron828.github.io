Chapter 1369 - Unbelievable!

When Lin Yun turned around and saw a person, he was instantly stumped. The entire world had also become quiet since it was an unparalleled youth who had appeared. This youth was donned in white clothes with an opening on his chest that revealed half of his chest.

His right shoulder was decorated with tree vines that was draped with a purple flower blooming on the vine. The flower had nine petals, and the bud of the flower had flames blazing on it that made it look sacred.

“The Divine Astral Flower?” The first thing that came to Lin Yun’s mind was the Divine Astral Flower.

But what shocked him even more was that this person had golden hair and ashen skin that seemed to have the bloodline of another race. At the same time, his eyes were deep like two abysses and the way he stood in mid-air was like looking at a natural portrait.

Some people were blessed with looks like celestial fairies who came out from paintings with an extraordinary and ethereal temperament. But this painting was different. He looked like he was a well-known painting to begin with. He was standing there, but he gave everyone a feeling that he was in the painting while everyone else was outside.

So this was Tian Xuanzi, the strongest genius in the past millennium in the Ancient Barren Domain? He was only a few hundred years old, but his strength was close to the Radiant Sword Saint. Not only the Ancient Barren Domain, but his name was famous in the entire Divine Dragon Era.

After all, the chant ‘Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren Domain’ wasn’t just a chant. Lin Yun couldn’t believe what he was saying because this person should be ambitious in his eyes, but he couldn’t sense any ill intentions from Tian Xuanzi. On the contrary, he always seemed to have a wisp of sorrow in his eyes.

Although Lin Yun knew that Tian Xuanzi wasn’t old, his appearance was a little ‘way’ too young.

“Vajra Monastery’s Xuan Kong greets the Saint Sovereign!”

“Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s Zhang Qiong greets the Saint Sovereign!”

This was the first time many Samsara Edict Realm experts from the other sects had seen Tian Xuanzi, so they quickly greeted him after they recovered from the shock. But Lin Yun didn’t because this person was emitting a dangerous aura that made him nervous.

If this person wanted to take out the Great Saint Origin, what should he do? Who could stop this person?

Lin Yun’s face changed because he knew he might not even have the time to summon the Firmament Battle Cloth before this person. It was so much so that the other party would sense the slightest hostility.

“This is a clone…and he seems to possess the Dragon Clan’s bloodline,” said Lil’ Purple. Her face was pale because she had previously used the origin divine rune, and she still hadn’t recovered fully. Feng Jue was also covered in wounds and was in a daze when he saw Tian Xuanzi.

Tian Xuanzi waved his hand, wanting to bring Zhuge Qingyun over to him. His hand reached the snowy mountain's summit, and no one could tell how he did it. As space distorted, he reached out, and it looked like it was narrowed.

But just when his hand was about to reach Zhuge Qingyun, Jian Jingtian let out a cold snort before he unleashed a sword ray. As the distorted space shattered, that hand could only return.

“Tian Xuanzi!” Jian Jingtian gritted his teeth with flames blazing in his pupils.

Tian Xuanzi pulled back his hand and lowered his head to see a blood droplet dripping down his finger. He sighed, “A Heavenly King indeed. You’re invincible as long as saints don’t show up.”

“Tian Xuanzi, stop faking it!” Jian Jingtian continued, “He dares to humiliate my master, so he has to die today. Let’s not mention that you’re only a clone. Even if you’re here personally, I’ll still kill him no matter what!”

But Tian Xuanzi was calm as he replied, “Looks like it’s a mistake for me to let you live eighteen years ago. But remember your oath. You won’t take a step out of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect in your lifetime.”

When he was done, Tian Xuanzi stepped out, looking as if he had flown out of a painting. When he stepped out of the painting, time and space had frozen in the surroundings. This time, he had personally come to the snowy mountain.

His movements weren’t fast, but everyone could clearly see him as he landed on the summit of the snowy mountain. When Jian Jingtian wanted to attack, he was shocked to discover that everything in the world had been restricted as a ripple spread out. Tian Xuanzi returned to where he initially stood with Zhuge Qingyun beside him.

The two were together, but it gave everyone a feeling that a painting separated them. One was standing in the painting while the other was outside the painting. When they returned, Jian Jingtian threw out a mouthful of blood before he fell to one knee.

This shocked Lin Yun. He wondered if Tian Xuanzi had made a move against Jian Jingtian. But he soon dispelled that thought because Tian Xuanzi merely glanced at Jian Jingtian when he brought Zhuge Qingyun away with him. But that glance alone was enough to inflict severe injuries on Jian Jingtian, who had become a Heavenly King.

As the surroundings fell into silence, everyone could feel their scalps going numb because Tian Xuanzi was simply too terrifying, not to mention that this was only one clone of his. They all knew Jian Jingtian's strength, but he was nothing before Tian Xuanzi.

“Remember what I just said, and remember your oath. Otherwise, I won’t let you off,” said Tian Xuanzi. No one could see any emotions on his face, but his words left everyone silent.

“Master, the Great Saint Origin is on him!” Zhuge Qingyun pointed his finger at Lin Yun.

When Tian Xuanzi looked at Lin Yun, Jian Jingtian struggled back to his feet, “You dare?!”

But Tian Xuanzi merely replied by pushing his palm, causing Jian Jingtian to throw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away. Even if this was only his clone, his appearance had already determined something.

“I saw it,” said Tian Xuanzi.

His words made Lin Yun’s heartthrob violently and he felt that the Profound Wither Key with the Great Saint Origin sealed within it would jump out of his heart in the next moment. At the same time, Lin Yun realized that he couldn’t budge when he tried to grab onto his throbbing heart.

But under Tian Xuanzi’s gaze, he couldn’t even circulate his astral energy, not to mention move. So his breathing gradually became hurried.

“Interesting… Lil’ Qin Cang’s Golden Dragon Bone is on you.” Tian Xuanzi had no change in his expression as he reached out in Lin Yun’s direction. But Lin Yun was surprised when his palm was about to land because he discovered he could move.

He was surprised, and he had no idea how he managed to escape from Tian Xuanzi’s restriction. Logically speaking, it should be easy for Tian Xuanzi to restrict his movements even if he was only a clone. But before they could think much about it, a pair of Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind Lin Yun, instantly bringing him far away.

This also caused Tian Xuanzi to miss, instantly shocking everyone. They were amazed that Lin Yun managed to avoid his grasp, but how was that possible? Earlier, Tian Xuanzi had easily used a glance to leave Jian Jingtian heavily injured, so how could Lin Yun avoid it when he was only at the Elysium Core Realm? This was simply too bizarre, just like someone crushing an ant with a palm, but the ant was still living well.

Suddenly, Lin Yun could sense the wisp of a dangerous aura, and he soared to the sky once more, avoiding Tian Xuanzi’s hand. When Tian Xuanzi failed again, this made everyone’s faces change. Even Lin Yun was shocked and in disbelief.

Although Lin Yun had no idea what was going on, he had all his feelings pent up when he previously saw how arrogant Tian Xuanzi was. He then raised his head and smiled. “Looks like the so-called ‘Profound Sky Saint Sovereign’ isn’t so impressive after all!”

“Master, you don’t have to trouble yourself with personally dealing with this brat. Let me do it.” Zhuge Qingyun was also shocked while watching from the side and wanted to act on behalf of Tian Xuanzi.

Hearing what Zhuge Qingyun said, Tian Xuanzi didn’t say anything that could be considered an acknowledgment. This made Lin Yun’s face change. Despite his words, he knew he couldn’t face either Tian Xuanzi or Zhuge Qingyun. If Zhuge Qingyun disregarded his identity and came after him, there was nothing he could do.

“Zhuge Qingyun, you bastard! Are you going to disregard your status?” Feng Jue flew into a rage beside Lin Yun.

“Get lost!” Zhuge Qingyun simply waved his hand to send Feng Jue flying away. He and Feng Jue had injuries on them, but Zhuge Qingyun’s recovery ability was a lot higher than Feng Jue.

“You brat, you dare to disregard my master? If I don’t teach you a lesson today, I’ll not be called Zhuge Qingyun!” Zhuge Qingyun had a killing aura emitting from his eyes. He might be injured, but he still gave off a powerful aura.

This scene made the corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitch because they were two completely different levels. Could it be that he had to bring out the Firmament Battle Cloth to kill Zhuge Qingyun? Looking at Zhuge Qingyun, enveloped in nine lights once more, beads of sweat began to roll down from Lin Yun’s forehead because he didn’t dare to summon the Firmament Battle Cloth before the Profound Sky Saint Sovereign.

“Kneel!” Zhuge Qingyun roared before he soared to the sky with his palm descending.

“Don’t be afraid! Beat him!” Just when Lin Yun wanted to avoid it, a voice resounded in his mind, causing Lin Yun to subconsciously push his palm out. Then, something bizarre happened. Zhuge Qingyun threw out a mouthful of blood before he fell to his knees. This scene instantly caused everyone’s jaws to drop with their eyeballs bulging.

“Holy shit…” The old monk, Xuan Kong of the Vajra Monastery, couldn’t hold back from cursing out. When he was done, he was shocked by his words and quickly covered his mouth. He then carefully looked around to see if anyone heard what he said, but no one was paying attention to him because they were also deeply shocked.

That was Zhuge Qingyun that they were talking about, someone who toyed with six Samsara Edict Realm experts in his hand like nothing. Not to mention them, but even Lin Yun was shocked by what just happened and couldn’t help taking a few steps back. Zhuge Qingyun was actually forced to go down on his knees with just a palm from him? This was simply too unbelievable.

“Slap him!” A playful voice resounded within Lin Yun’s mind once more. With no hesitation, Lin Yun stepped forth and raised his hand into the air.

“You bastard, you dare?!” Zhuge Qingyun flew into a rage as he quickly got back on his feet. But the moment he rose, he took a slap from Lin Yun and fell to his knees again.

“Kick him!” When that voice resounded within his mind once more, Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to let out a burst of laughter before he kicked Zhuge Qingyun. His kick fell onto Zhuge Qingyun’s face, sending him flying back and spinning in the air. When Zhuge Qingyun fell to the ground, he instantly fainted and lost consciousness.

At this moment, everyone in the surroundings was quiet as they looked at Lin Yun with disbelief, with their eyes wide open.
