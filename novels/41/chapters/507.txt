Chapter 508 - Unconvinced?

“Big Brother Lin, the name of this courtyard is Aquamist Pavilion. This is where Senior Sister Liu stayed previously. This is a good residence in the academy and it’s not any inferior to the residence of an inner disciple. You can stay here for today. I believe the elders will get you another residence when you become a guest elder tomorrow. But…” Bai Yi led Lin Yun to a courtyard, but she was in a dilemma.

“What’s the matter?” smiled Lin Yun.

“Big Brother Lin, I’m afraid that your position as a guest elder will experience some turbulence,” whispered Bai Yi as she lowered her head.

Lin Yun laughed inwardly as Bai Yi wasn’t as stupid as she seemed. He asked, “What do you mean?”

“Normally speaking, you should be going to the Imperial Study Hall with Senior Sister Liu right now. But Elder Yu seems to have something to talk to Senior Sister Liu about because she sent you away,” said Bai Yi as she mustered up her courage.

“I naturally know about it. But it’s not that simple to take the guest deacon position from me,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Oh yeah. How could you not figure it out when I already have. Big Brother Lin, I’ll take my leave then. I stay nearby, so you can look for me if you need anything,” replied Bai Yi as she pointed to another building not too far away.

“Okay.” After sending Bai Yi off, the smile on Lin Yun’s face disappeared as he muttered to himself, “Smells like trouble.”

However, Lin Yun would just deal with whatever that came his way. He would wait and see what the academy was trying to play at.

After taking a brief rest, Lin Yun removed the sword box and opened it up. Holding onto the Flower Burial Sword, he slowly poured his silvery sword energy into it, which caused it to buzz. He could sense a deep connection with the sword.

When he drew the sword, he could sense a boundless energy fluctuating within his body. At the same time, his aura also reached the pinnacle. When he drew his sword, a silvery sword ray lit up the entire residence as a terrifying sword aura began to spread out from him. He could control his aura as he wished, so whoever underestimated him would face his terror.

The next day, Liu Yunyan came to Lin Yun’s courtyard.

“You’re pretty early. It looks like there’s an outcome,” said Lin Yun.

“Things have gone beyond my expectation a little, but I still submitted my recommendation. We now have to go to the elders,” replied Liu Yunyan as she nodded her head.

The two then headed to the Imperial Study Hall together. On the way, the disciples that they passed would respectfully greet Liu Yunyan. There were also many teachers explaining the profundities of spiritual runes while the disciples sat on floor mats to listen to the teachers.

“Spiritual runes have been passed down since ancient times and they can be further separated into different elements. Gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. Gold represents sharpness and toughness. It is usually used to refine artifacts. Wood is used mostly to refine puppets. Water is used mostly for pellets. Fire is used mostly as a destructive force. Lastly, earth is used for arrays.”

“Then again, nothing is absolute. High ranking spiritualists can also use water attributed spiritual runes to kill their enemies and can control fire attributed spiritual runes to strengthen pellets. Aside from these core runes, there are also many variant spiritual runes like wind, chill, and lightning. They’re incredibly powerful, but they’re also very complicated.”

Lin Yun paused his footsteps briefly when he heard this explanation. Instantly, many thoughts he had trouble with in the past suddenly cleared up.

“It looks like you have some attainments in spiritual runes,” smiled Liu Yunyan.

“I only know a bit,” replied Lin Yun with a smile. He could create second grade spiritual runes, but he knew nothing about elementary knowledge, such as the spiritual runes’ elements.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the Imperial Study Hall. The Imperial Study Hall was similar to the Elder Hall and it was an important ground in the academy. The moment they entered, Lin Yun could sense the solemn atmosphere with more than ten elders present.

All of them were experts in the Yin-Yang stage, having reached the pinnacle of the Yin-Yang stage long ago. They were only one step away from the Heavenly Soul Realm. If Guardian Plum were here, he wouldn’t seem significant at all.

The old man seated at the center emitted a terrifying aura that even left Lin Yun fearful. He was emitting the aura of a Heavenly Soul Realm cultivator. Lin Yun was shocked because he didn’t think that this place had a Heavenly Soul Realm cultivator.

“Lesser Yin stage? He barely fits the qualification of being a guest elder. Additionally, isn’t he a little too young? He must be less than twenty, right?”

“Most importantly, he’s already in the Violet Palace Realm judging from his aura. He was still in the Profound Martial Realm half a month ago, so I’m afraid no one will be convinced with him becoming a guest deacon.”

“Indeed. Core disciples might be able to make a recommendation, but we can’t be too casual about agreeing.”

“He can become a disciple if he has some attainments in spiritual runes. But being a guest deacon isn’t appropriate.”

“That’s right. It’s more than enough for him to become an inner disciple with his cultivation at such a young age.”

Lin Yun could hear the discussions coming from the elders the moment he entered. Their eyes were keen and they could see Lin Yun’s cultivation with a glance. Many of them were shaking their heads inwardly.

“Silence.” The old man seated at the center snorted out coldly, causing the discussions to settle down. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Lin Yun, this is Senior Tang Yu. He’s the person in charge of the Imperial Study Hall,” whispered Liu Yunyan.

“Great Qin Empire, Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Lin Yun greets Senior Tang Yu and the elders present,” said Lin Yun as he gave a slight bow.

“Cultivation doesn’t equate to strength. You must have something special since you can aid Liu Yunyan in obtaining the Indigoflame Goldlotuses. But…becoming a guest deacon of the academy isn’t as easy as you think. Then again, it’s simple if you just want a position. We can arrange a casual position for you,” said Tang Yu. The meaning in his tone was clear.

If Lin Yun only wanted a position, that could be easily arranged for Liu Yunyan’s sake. But if Lin Yun wanted a higher position, then he had to speak with his strength. Otherwise, there was no need for the academy to give him a high position. It might sound cold, but it was still within Lin Yun’s acceptable range.

“The Great Qin Empire? And here I thought you had a huge background. So it turns out that it’s a piece of trash from the Great Qin Empire.” A voice sounded from outside the hall. When Lin Yun and Liu Yunyn turned around, they saw a man and woman walking side by side.

The lady wore a purple dress and her temperament wasn’t any inferior to Liu Yunyan. But her aura was a lot higher than Liu Yunyan as it was in the greater Yin stage. The Yin stage of the Violet Palace Realm had three stages- the lesser, greater, and pinnacle stage.

Without talent or a fortunate encounter, wanting to reach the greater Yin stage wouldn’t be easy. The youth standing beside the woman also had a high cultivation in the pinnacle lesser Yin stage. His aura was powerful and it was evident from just a glance that he was from a huge clan. He wasn’t someone that the likes of Han Fei and Pan Yue could compare to. Furthermore, he was even showing signs of making a breakthrough into the greater Yin stage. He was naturally the one who spoke earlier.

“Mo Lin and Mo Feng greet Senior Tang Yu and all the elders present.” The two glanced at Lin Yun coldly before they greeted the elders here. On the other hand, Lin Yun looked at them as he fell into deep thought. They must be the trouble that Liu Yunyan spoke about.

“Mo Ling is also here.”

“Compared to Liu Yunyan, the person Mo Ling recommended is a lot better. There’s a drastic difference in their cultivation.”

“Someone who had just reached the lesser Yin stage and another who had reached the pinnacle lesser Yin stage… there’s nothing to compare.”

“The Nether Prefectural City’s Mo Clan is a lot more powerful than the Great Qin Empire. Even if their cultivation is the same, there’s no way Lin Yun can fight with this Mo Feng. He’ll only lose badly.”

“The Mo Clan also has a deep relationship with our academy. If we have to choose, Mo Feng is clearly the better choice,” said the elders as they nodded their heads at Mo Feng.

Mo Feng was smug with confidence and ignored Lin Yun. On the other hand, Mo Ling who was standing beside him, took a few glances at Lin Yun.

“Senior Tang Yu, Lin Yun might originate from the Great Qin Empire, but he’s definitely not any weaker than Mo Feng. He emerged from the Dragon Gate Competition through Hell Mode and received his title as Flower Burial. At the same time, he defeated the likes of Han Fei and Pan Yue when he was only in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm,” said Liu Yunyan with a grave expression.

“Defeat Pan Yue? How is that possible…”

“It doesn’t make sense that he can defeat the likes of Han Fei in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm. But if that’s the case, then he’s fully qualified to become a guest deacon.”

“Liu Yunyn should be lying. At the very least, she did obtain the lotuses.” The elders might still have doubts on their faces, but their expressions were clearly a lot better than before.

“Liu Yunyan, do you need to lie just for a guest deacon position? Praising a piece of trash from the Great Qin Empire to such a high position? If the Imperial Study Hall gives the guest deacon position to someone like him, I’ll be unconvinced. The Mo Clan also won’t take this lying down,” said Mo Feng coldly as his face sank down.

“Unconvinced? Why don’t you tell me how you can be convinced?” Lin Yun suddenly spoke up with a sharp flash in his eyes.
