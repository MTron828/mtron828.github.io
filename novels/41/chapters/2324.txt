Chapter 2325 - Superstitious

Xiong Tiannan looked disappointed and furious, especially when he learned that the ancient sword contained a golden fortune. He was naturally aggrieved. If only he had chosen that ancient sword from the beginning.

“What’s going on? He looks a little dumb.” Ji Zixi said, leaning on Lin Yun. She continued, “Big Brother Lin, should we go and take a look? I want to see what’s inside the coffins.”

“Let’s not go there for now. Something seems odd," Lin Yun's expression turned serious; his sword sense was sensitive and had detected a hint of danger. As soon as he finished speaking, ten ancient corpses flew out from the coffins, releasing a demonic radiance and demonic clouds enveloped the entire valley, giving even Lin Yun some pressure.

Lin Yun furrowed his brows. "Such a strong corpse aura..."

Xiong Tiannan was also very alert but was too close and couldn’t react in time. When he raised his head, three figures pounced on him, leaving ten ferocious wounds on his body with their sharp claws. But it didn’t end there. The corpses bared their fangs at Xiong Tiannan, biting down.

“Get lost!” Xiong Tiannan flew into a rage as his golden pill was unleashed, knocking the corpses back. But he grimaced his teeth and was horrified to discover that he had a few pieces of flesh torn away. His wounds also gave off a black miasma, with a poison swiftly spreading through his body.

“Corpse poison!” Xiong Tiannan took a deep breath with his face changing. When he raised his head, he saw the corpses gobbling up the flesh they tore from him. But what happened later was even more terrifying as three corpses devoured the surrounding spiritual energy by entering their mouths and they gradually recovered.

Xiong Tiannan’s lips twitched, and he said, “Just how unlucky was I to run into Corpse Kings?”

He had no time to complain since the remaining seven corpses had pounced forth like wild beasts. They looked at Xiong Tiannan as though they were looking at lunch.

Usually, when facing these corpses, he could leave quickly, even if he couldn’t defeat them. But he was in trouble now…Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I’m done for!” Xiong Tiannan discovered that the corpse poison had infiltrated his golden pill, and he could only use 30% of his strength. Suddenly, dozens of sword rays flew past him and landed on those corpses.

But the corpses didn’t even step back and those sword rays crumbled. A figure flashed and pulled him away with two palms pushing forth, forcing those corpses to take a few steps back. This person was naturally Lin Yun, who frowned since this was the first time he ran into such troublesome corpses.

“Brother, hold on for a little longer. I’ll come to help you after I get rid of the corpse poison in my body.” Xiong Tiannan ran and stopped at the entrance of the valley.

Lin Yun ignored Xiong Tiannan and flicked his finger with nine Azure Dragon ribbons flying out. The ribbons were inscribed with Azure Dragon Divine Runes. They were like nine dragons that sent the corpses flying away.

“I can’t pierce through them?” Lin Yun smiled as he extended his hand with nine ribbons coming together. It worked this time. The corpse at the front had its head pierced. But the corpse was still alive and continued to rush towards Lin Yun with thick poisonous fog gushing out from its neck.

The corpse poison might be lethal to others, but it was useless against Lin Yun. He turned around and landed on the ground with three hundred Azure Dragon ribbons flying out. As the ribbons combined, seven corpses were nailed to the ground with a dragon’s roar. But the corpses were tenacious and continued to struggle.

Lin Yun raised his head and looked at the three corpses devouring the surrounding spiritual energy with a frown. His sword intent was trembling with fear, so he muttered, “Just what the hell are these monsters…?”

With no time for further thought, Lin Yun waved his hand and two thousand ribbons flew out behind him. The ribbons wrapped the three corpse kings together, isolating them from the outside world to not allow them to devour spiritual energy.

Lin Yun’s rationale told him it was time to leave, but he wanted to fight a little longer. Just as he pondered, an explosion occurred with the ribbons being torn apart by the three Corpse Kings. He grunted and took a few steps back, his face changing. The ribbons were inscribed with Azure Dragon Divine Runes, but they failed to control those corpse kings, and the backlash injured him.

“Die!” The three corpse kings radiated with golden light in their eyes with a terrifying descending aura.

“What the hell is Xiong Tiannan doing?” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked, but he didn’t panic. Under the pressure, Lin Yun’s bottleneck loosened, and he made a breakthrough. The golden radiance in his eyes condensed into golden runes. This was a sign that Lin Yun had achieved the Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent!

When he raised his head, his sword intent tore apart the demonic radiance and dispersed the clouds in the sky. He squinted and the ribbons with Metal Divine Rune inscribed on them bundled together before the corpse kings could make a move. When they flew out, they divided into three and Lin Yun waved his hand again, unleashing the three thousand ribbons that were inscribed with the Phoenix Divine Runes, looking like a silver waterfall that was pouring down.

When Xiong Tiannan opened his eyes and saw this scene, he was left dumbfounded. When everything came to an end, the three corpses were turned to ashes, leaving behind three golden fortunes. As for the seven corpses on the ground, they left behind seven indigo fortunes when they disappeared.

“Golden fortune!” Xiong Tiannan jumped out. But just when he wanted to contact them, he saw Lin Yun’s gaze directed at him. This frightened Xiong Tiannan with his heart trembling in fear.

Holy shit, so fierce? Xiong Tiannan inwardly muttered. He raised his voice with anger on his face, “Why are you looking at me? Do you think that I’m trying to snatch them? I just want to collect them for you. Here, they’re yours.”

Xiong Tiannan gathered the golden fortunes in his palm and furiously handed them to Lin Yun, and Lin Yun accepted.

This immediately made Xiong Tiannan want to lose it, but he awkwardly smiled, “Golden fortune… golden fortune…”

He turned around and went to collect the indigo fortunes before he fell into a dilemma. He had already given away the golden fortunes, so he couldn’t give away the indigo fortunes. He was only being generous, not afraid of Lin Yun. Not to mention that those belonged to him, to begin with.

“Hehe, thanks for saving my life.” Xiong Tiannan raised the indigo fortunes and chuckled, “Here, I have collected them for you as well.”

But the moment he gave them out, he felt heartache with his heart bleeding.

“It’s nothing.” Lin Yun stowed the indigo fortunes, not being polite with Xiong Tiannan.

Xiong Tiannan nearly lost his temper, with his face becoming distorted, but he still maintained his smile since he still had the corpse poison in him. But when he saw Lin Yun raising his hand, he began to make a vicious vow. If he dares to touch me, I’ll kill him!

Lin Yun’s hands suddenly fell onto his shoulder, nearly making his legs soft.

Xiong Tiannan said in a sobbing tone, “Brother, what are you trying to do? I don’t have any more treasures on me. Why don’t you take the cauldron as well?”

“What are you thinking about? You still have corpse poison, so let me help you with it,” Lin Yun said. He knew the corpse poison was troublesome, especially when it had accumulated for thousands of years. So Xiong Tiannan naturally couldn’t remove it anytime soon.

After a while, Xiong Tiannan felt relieved, experiencing excruciating pain but knowing that the corpse poison had been completely removed from his body.

“Great skills,” Xiong Tiannan smiled as he tried moving his limbs. “You’re not afraid that I’ll make a move against you after recovering?”

“Stop pretending. Your face became pale when you saw how Big Brother Lin got rid of the corpse kings earlier,” Ji Zixi said, witnessing the entire event.

Xiong Tiannan awkwardly smiled, realizing that he couldn’t refute her.

“Honestly, I should let you have the golden fortune, but they're too important to me since I came from the Kunlun Realm. I will compensate you if I find any fruits or treasures,” Lin Yun said.

“Don’t worry about it. There’s no need to be so formal between us,” Xiong Tiannan said, but his thoughts weren’t the same as what he said.

However, Lin Yun noticed this and recognized Xiong Tiannan as someone capable of interacting with. He smiled, “Speaking of which, what were you doing earlier?”

“Opening the coffins is the same as opening mystery boxes, but I’m too unlucky. So, I resorted to superstitious means. But it was a pity that it didn’t change anything. On the other hand, Brother Lin is fortunate.”

After mentioning that, Xiong Tiannan already overlooked what just happened earlier.

“Superstitious?” Lin Yun muttered and smiled, shaking his head.

“Anyways, I have remembered this favor. I’ll get you a few mystery boxes in the future,” Xiong Tiannan said earnestly.

Ji Zixi covered her mouth, and smiled, “You just want to brush on Big Brother Lin’s fortune.”

Her voice was melodious and sounded like a wind chime.

Even if he was exposed, Xiong Tiannan wasn’t angry and laughed instead, “You’re smart. Brother Lin, you don’t mind if I brush some of your luck, right?”

“Sure,” Lin Yun replied with a smile.

As they spoke, a golden beam shot to the sky as though it wanted to pierce through the Heavenly Barren Realm.

Seeing this, Xiong Tiannan’s expression became serious, and he said, “The Sovereign Monument has appeared!”
