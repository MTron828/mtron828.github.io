Chapter 974 - Remember What I Said?!

Lin Yun had basically slapped Shi Xuan and Song Rui in the face with unimaginable arrogance. Although the seven heads were strong, they were more interested in the inheritance above fortune and not the astral spirits. So the competition right now was between the owners of the astral spirits. The owners of the astral spirits were publicly acknowledged for their strength. However, this only applied to the owners of the five elemental astral spirits.

“Lin Yun, do you think you’re on the same level as us just because you killed Liu Mu? You have no idea of the battles we went through to obtain our astral spirits. We’ve seen many arrogant people like you, so I advise you to think again before talking.” Song Rui’s face sank. “After all, being alive is better than being dead.”

Everyone could sense the faint killing intent coming from Song Rui. Even Shi Xuan’s face had turned cold as he said, “I changed my mind. I’ll spare your life if you kneel down and hand the painting to me. Otherwise, I’ll make you wish you were dead!”

“Cut the crap!” Lin Yun disregarded their threat as his right hand slowly reached out.

“You’re courting death!” snorted Song Rui as he attacked first. Taking half a step forward, boundless origin energy came crashing down like a mountain onto Lin Yun. The shockwave from the aura alone sent the crowd flying.

Shortly after, Song Rui disappeared into the air and appeared in front of Lin Yun. Circulating all of his origin energy into his hand, he threw a punch at Lin Yun. Instantly, a phenomenon of an endless mountain range appeared behind him.

Then, Song Rui’s punch collided with heavy force with Lin Yun’s sword aura. Although the punch caused Lin Yun’s azure dragon sword aura to tremble, it wasn’t able to crack it. It was no longer that easy to shatter Lin Yun’s sword aura.

“Sword intent? No wonder you dare to be so arrogant. Your sword intent is truly impressive. Unfortunately for you, you ran into me!” Song Rui wasn’t shocked that he couldn’t break Lin Yun’s sword intent. After all, it was already public knowledge that Lin Yun had a powerful sword intent.

“River Manifestation Earth!” Song Rui sneered as gray earth origin energy manifested into a towering mountain. “River Nine Circulation—Earth Dragon!”

The mud on the mountain turned into a surging river as Song Rui opened his hand. Then, Song Rui slammed his hand down as a ferocious yellow dragon swept towards Lin Yun. The crowd became fearful as they recognized Song Rui’s iconic technique.

His second-grade earth intent had reached a high stage. With this attack, he could easily crush all of his opponents. Even an ordinary expert in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm would be killed if they were hit by it.

As for Shi Xuan, he was standing by the side and didn’t make a move. However, he was watching Lin Yun like a hawk. Clearly, he didn’t think that Song Rui needed his help to kill Lin Yun.

“An imperial fortune martial technique?” Lin Yun squinted his eyes and looked at the yellow dragon charging at him with surprise.

However, Lin Yun merely waved his hand and retrieved his sword. When he grabbed hold of the sword hilt, he took a deep breath. A dazzling sword ray permeated the surroundings as Lin Yun swung his sword.

Lin Yun’s sword aura violently surged as he executed the first form of the Three Heavenly Divides.

“You’re courting death!” Ridicule flashed in Song Rui’s eyes. His attack was an imperial fortune martial technique, so how could anything but the Divine Glorysun Fist compare? Suddenly, nine lightning cocoons shined from inside of the yellow dragon’s body. Each cocoon was located at the weakest spot of the dragon and ready to explode.

“Break!” Lin Yun roared as the yellow dragon was shattered. The spectators were in disbelief because Song Rui’s imperial fortune martial technique was destroyed and blood was dripping from his lips.

Did Lin Yun really destroy Song Rui’s strongest attack with a single sword? At this moment, Lin Yun’s sword intent was sweeping out..

With Flower Burial in his hand, this allowed his sword intent to undergo a drastic transformation and everyone could sense a terrifying cutting edge coming from Lin Yun.

“This sword intent…” Shi Xuan and Song Rui’s gazes became solemn because they never expected Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent to be so powerful.

Earlier, when Lin Yun empowered his sword intent into his fist, it was still somewhat lacking in sharpness. But after Lin Yun drew his sword, his sword intent had undergone a drastic transformation. It far exceeded Shi Xuan and Song Rui’s understanding.

It wasn’t something that could be explained with a greater dao artifact. It was eye opening for Shi XUan since he grasped the spiritual saber intent. He could sense that his martial intent was on the same level as Lin Yun. However, he was certain that Lin Yun’s sword intent could easily suppress him.

Just how did that fellow manage to do it? Shi Xuan and Song Rui both exchanged a glance with disbelief radiating from their eyes.

“Your sword intent isn’t far from reaching the sky sword intent…” Shi Xuan’s face became grave as he gritted his teeth.

“Who knows?” sneered Lin Yun.

“Use our astral spirits! I don’t believe that we can’t suppress him!” Shi Xuan’s face sank as he brought out his astral spirit together. WIth the Glorygold Spirit and Gloryearth Spirit out, Shi Xuan and Song Rui’s martial intent rose rapidly.

“Together!” Along with a torrential aura, Shi Xuan and Song Rui charged at Lin Yun. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Great timing!” Lin Yun grinned with cold light in his eyes. Without any fear, he faced them head-on. At this moment, he was enveloped by an azure dragon that was manifested with his boundless sword intent.

The clash caused a violent storm to break out in the palace as all sorts of phenomena bloomed. After ten moves, Lin Yun’s sword intent became even more ferocious. He was relying on his boundless sword intent to suppress Shi Xuan and Song Rui.

Suddenly, Lin Yun unleashed Terranean Destruction, which contained all nine forms of the Dustlight Sword Art. When the radiating sword ray exploded, Song Rui’s aura crumbled apart as he was smashed into a wall.

Under the violent impact, the runes on the walls finally cracked as sparks flew out. When all the crowd saw this, they had disbelief written in their eyes.

“Shi Xuan, it's your turn!” Shi Xuan’s face had changed drastically after Song Rui was sent flying. He wanted to retreat, but Lin Yun’s voice had already reached him. When he turned around, he could see the coldness in Lin Yun torrential killing intent in his pupils.

An Azure Firmament Tree appeared with Iris Flowers adorned on its branches. Lin Yun’s sword aura had formed a lake under the tree with countless lotuses. Shi Xuan gazed on with fear. Thrust into a dead end, he forced out all of his potential in order to defend against Lin Yun’s attack.

Unfortunately, Lin Yun’s sword was too quick. The demonic corpse that Shi Xuan used to block Lin Yun’s sword was cut in half. Then, without losing any speed or power, Lin Yun’s sword shattered Shi Xuan’s defensive dao artifact. He instantly threw up blood and fell to one knee.

But before he could get back up, Lin Yun descended from the sky. Receiving a swift kick, Shi Xuan was forced down on both knees.

After Lin Yun was done, he looked at Shi Xuan coldly, “You remember what I said, right?”

“What do you wa…” Shi Xuan suddenly recalled something as rage poured out of his eyes. But before he could finish his words, a resounding slap sent him flying.

Then, Lin Yun chased after Shi Xuan and followed up with two more slaps. Shi Xuan was slapped so hard that he spit out several broken teeth covered in blood. When he finally hit the ground, he was lying next to Song Rui who was struggling to get back on his feet.

Lin Yun coldly stared at them, forcing Song Rui’s legs to grow weak. Song Rui trembled before he fell to his knees.
