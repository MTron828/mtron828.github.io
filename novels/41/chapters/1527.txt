Chapter 1528 - Kill!

Lin Yun’s proficiency in the Heaven and Earth Sword Forms increased while he fought the five chief disciples. The five were already at the Dragon Pulse Realm, which further proved how terrifying the sword forms were after combining them with his Firmament Sword Intent.

This was enough to cover their cultivation differences and suppress his opponent. The Earth Sword Form could keep stacking gravity. So after seventy-two swords, the gravity would multiply by seventy-two folds. No matter how strong they were, it would be tough for them to exhibit their full strength.

The five chief disciples all had great difficulty moving, and they were all in slow motion in the eyes of Lin Yun. On the other hand, Lin Yun was as agile as a fish as his sword aura began to rise violently, with his aura reaching a terrifying height.

As the two ancient ‘heaven’ and ‘earth’ words revolved, Lin Yun swung his sword once more with the surrounding space being distorted. After Lin Yun’s figure gradually became blurred, the five chief disciples couldn’t bring out their advantage in the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“What’s going on?” The Samsara Edict Realm elders of the seven demonic sects’ faces changed with shock in their pupils. At this moment, no one doubted Lin Yun’s identity anymore. Even if he couldn’t show proof, his sword technique alone was more than enough.

Tian Jue’s face changed, and he felt fortunate that he wasn’t impulsive.

Under the overlapping of gravity, the ‘heaven’ came crashing down. But Murong Chen quickly retreated with a trace of blood dripping from the corner of his lips. With shock in his pupils, he gritted his teeth, “Damn it! What is this power?!”

He was already at the Dragon Pulse Realm but was in a disadvantageous position in his fight with Lin Yun. This was simply too outrageous!

But Lin Yun didn’t chase after Murong Chen. He unleashed a dazzling sword ray that brightly bloomed from behind him, making others think he had eyes in the back of his head. Just like that, Chen Kui, Yan Xuan, and Pei An were sent flying away.

After taking two steps forth, Lin Yun’s sword rays left several wounds on the three of them. He then slanted to the side to avoid a sword ray that was directed at him from Qin Yue of the Seven Absolute Palace.

He was also someone who grasped the Firmament Sword Intent. This sword was directed at Lin Yun’s temple, but Lin Yun easily avoided it. That sword ray brushed past Lin Yun’s head and sliced off several strands of hair.

Under the multiplied gravity, the speed of the falling hair was slowed. When Lin Yun shook his wrist, the Flower Burial Sword flew out, and the hair drifting in the air was sliced into two. Then, the sword rays charged over in an even more ferocious momentum, wanting to cut Qin Yue into two.

The collision caused a massive explosion, and Qin Yue’s saint armor was reduced to ashes under Lin Yun’s sword. He even felt that his soul had been shaken. Throwing out a mouthful of blood, his eyes were filled with grievances. He was confident that he could avoid that sword if it wasn’t for the multiplied gravity.

After Lin Yun sent him flying away, his Flower Burial Sword began to vibrate like a draconic roar, causing a fluctuation in the air. When Lin Yun poured his astral energy and the dragon-phoenix sword aura into the sword, he waved his hand, and his sword landed on Murong Chen, who was charging over.

This made Murong Chen throw out a mouthful of blood before his saint artifact was sent flying away, while Lin Yun’s sword was rebounded. Without turning around, Lin Yun began to form seals. A black flower bloomed behind him. It was a twelve-petaled Netherflower.

When the twelve-petaled Netherflower fully bloomed, Lin Yun’s fingers were like taut bows as he executed the Flicking Divine Finger—Graceful Moment, Absolute Hit. The twelve-petaled Netherflower manifested into sword rays that were flying out, instantly decimating Chen Kui’s group of four.

When they were sent flying away, Lin Yun soared into the sky. The Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him while he grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword. As the ancient ‘heaven’ and ‘earth’ revolved around him, each of his swords made him look like a celestial as he executed the Aquaheaven Sword Technique.

All of this took place in the blink of an eye. Lin Yun was like a cannonball piercing through the layers of space. When his sword reached Murong Chen, Murong Chen took a hit head-on before he could even grab onto his demonic blade.

As sword rays exploded like a dazzling sun, countless rock fragments flew about. The asteroid that Murong Chen was standing on shattered, and his face became pale with his seven orifices bleeding. This made everyone dumbfounded because the grace of that sword stumped them.

But when Lin Yun wanted to follow up and slay Murong Chen, he suddenly groaned, with flaws starting to appear in his sword aura. This alarmed the initially despaired Murong Chen, who quickly took this opportunity to duck to the side.

“Get lost!” Murong Chen took the opportunity while he retreated to counterattack. When his palm landed on Lin Yun’s chest, his palm sent Lin Yun flying away before he grabbed onto his demonic blade.

“Is this all you got?” Murong Chen laughed when he saw that he was in an advantageous position once more before he charged over.

“You’re courting death!” A cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s pupils, and he sent Murong Chen flying back. His attack shattered Murong Chen’s attack. But just when Lin Yun was about to step forth, he suddenly threw out a mouthful of blood because it felt like his Firmament Sword Intent was being torn apart.

Many Samsara Edict Realm elders looked in the direction of the Netherworld Hall’s Qiu Qiong with surprise in their eyes. As Samsara Edict Realm experts, they naturally knew what happened earlier: Qiu Qiong made a move. The first time was relatively discrete, but he didn’t bother hiding the second time, which surprised them. After all, Lin Yun was the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint.

It was fine if it was a battle between juniors. But for a Samsara Edict Realm elder to make a move personally. Wasn’t he afraid that the Radiant Sword Saint would come looking for him?

“Haha!” Qiu Qiong disregarded all the gazes with mockery flashing across his pupils. “Is this all to the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint’? You’re nothing. So you can only die in the hands of my Netherworld Hall’s genius!”

As he spoke, a power surged forth and tore the ancient ‘heaven’ and ‘earth’ words around Lin Yun into pieces. This made Lin Yun throw out another mouthful of blood while he fell onto one knee.

“Murong Chen, kill him!” The four chief disciples said with their voices filled with killing intent while being covered with injuries.

“Are you unwilling to accept it? This is a fact, and this is the difference between us! So what if you’re the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint? Today, I’ll take your life!” Murong Chen coldly smiled. His aura suddenly exploded. A mighty draconic aura exploded from the droplet of black liquid within his astral energy ocean.

“Dragon origin!”

“Murong Chen actually condensed a droplet of dragon origin! He has really hidden it quite deeply!”

“I’m afraid that Lin Yun will die today!” Exclamations resounded from the surroundings as Murong Chen laughed with his hair fluttering in the wind. So what if Lin Yun was the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint? He would take Lin Yun’s life and use him as a stepping stone to becoming the holy son! At that time, the Blue Dragon Bone and Netherflower would belong to him!

Pushing that droplet of dragon origin to the limit, a black dragon suddenly appeared behind him as Murong Chen swung his blade down. His blade was fast, slicing everything before falling towards Lin Yun.

Since Lin Yun’s sword aura was torn apart and the two words were destroyed, he was weakened and couldn’t lift his sword. When Murong Chen’s sword landed on him, three thousand dragon runes shattered, and he was sent flying away.

But when Murong Chen pushed that droplet of dragon origin to the limit, he unleashed eighteen blades in a split second, and his blade rays traveled faster than lightning.

Before the dragon runes could condense into a saint armor, they were shattered by the blade rays. But the dragon runes were endless. The Blue Dragon Bone could regenerate them like astral energy. Eighteen blades later, all the dragon runes were shattered, and Lin Yun took eighteen blades with his body.

After Lin Yun’s dragon runes collapsed, Murong Chen’s blade rays continued and reduced Lin Yun’s surroundings into chaos. Qiu Qiong’s gaze was indifferent. He could sense a weak aura in that region, and this was the best outcome. After all, Lin Yun was the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, and this meant that he normally couldn’t make a move against Lin Yun so openly.

But the Sword Sect wouldn’t be able to say a word if Lin Yun died at the hands of Murong Chen. He had nothing to fear at all.

On the other hand, Murong Chen was gasping for breath with his forehead covered in sweat. But his pupils were radiating with anxiety and excitement. Not too far away, Chen Kui’s group of four also felt anxious because Murong Chen was too ruthless. They would feel uneasy if Murong Chen became their enemy.

As the commotion settled, Lin Yun was revealed from the cloud of dust. But his aura was fragile, and his heart was barely beating.

“Ha!” Murong Chen smiled. “It’s best for you to die!”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

As he spoke, he slowly walked over to Lin Yun, wanting to take Lin Yun’s head, dig the Blue Dragon Bone out from him, and retrieve his interspatial bracelet.

Lin Yun was hovering in the air with his eyes closed, looking like he was sleeping. But he was already dead. His vitality had disappeared. Qiu Qiong heavily injured him, and he took Murong Chen’s strongest attack head-on.

He might seem asleep, but everyone knew he wouldn’t be able to open his eyes again. This scene made tears roll down An Liuyan’s cheeks since she couldn’t believe what she saw.

Suddenly, Lin Yun opened his eyes and raised his hand with twenty thousand dragon runes poured into his palm. When Lin Yun let out a ferocious roar, he unleashed the Azure Dragon Grasp. An azure dragon claw was suddenly manifested and grabbed onto Murong Chen, lifting the latter by his neck.

“Stop!” Qiu Qiong’s face changed when he saw this scene.

But Lin Yun had fooled Qiu Qiong by pretending to be dead. So how could he possibly let Murong Chen off so easily? As a cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, he easily crushed Murong Chen’s head. Just like that, Murong Chen’s headless corpse fell to the ground.

This left everyone shocked, their eyes bulging. Even Qiu Qiong’s mind had briefly short-circuited. He couldn’t believe that Lin Yun dared to kill the chief disciple of their Netherworld Hall right before his eyes. It was like a resounding slap to his face.

But Lin Yun didn’t stop there. He roared, “Sword!”

When the Flower Burial Sword flew into his hand, a sword ray flashed across Murong Chen’s headless corpse, obliterating it completely. His sword aura, which was torn apart by Qiu Qiong early, suddenly reached the peak and broke through the limit of the Firmament Sword Intent.

At this moment, the quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent shone brightly on the Flower Burial Sword. He only fights for the present and not the future. As Lin Yun hysterically laughed, he turned around, and sent his sword ray flying past Chen Kui’s group of four, instantly severing them from their waists. If a massacre couldn’t be avoided, he would build a path of bones to his throne!
