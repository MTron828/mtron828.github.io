Chapter 2371 - You Can Leave Now

“How dare you people spoil my plan!” The Blood Conceal King was furious as he looked at Lin Yun. The shackles in his hands blazed with flames as they swept at Lin Yun.

As the two shackles flew out, the surrounding space would distort with tremendous pressure descending.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with fury, but he soon calmed down, suppressing his anger and avoiding the incoming attacks. Jiang Ziyao’s group was too much, but he couldn’t afford to be distracted, and this wasn’t the moment to fight the Blood Conceal King.

While executing the Divine Sunchasing Art, Lin Yun was like a bright sun as he flew around. In the surrounding distorted space, Lin Yun’s figure flashed around. He had pushed his movement technique to the limit, and the world would become dark whenever he flashed. When he reappeared, a dazzling radiance would sweep out while the changes between light and dark made it uncomfortable to the eyes.

The Blood Conceal King was furious that none of his attacks would on Lin Yun, and he lost it. As the Blood Conceal King roared, the golden demonic runes on him gradually recovered. He continued to chase after Lin Yun, who couldn’t shake him off no matter how much he tried. At the same time, the Blood Conceal King released his aura as a Saint Sovereign, filling the surroundings with a powerful pressure that even restrained Lin Yun’s sword intent.

“Not bad...” Heavenly Book smiled, “He’s jumping around like a monkey, but I must admit he’s agile.”

“If this continues, the Blood Conceal King won’t be able to do anything to him,” Jiang Ziyao said coldly. He wanted Lin Yun and the Blood Conceal King to perish together. Everyone knew that the Blood Conceal King wouldn’t be able to last for much longer, and their plans would go down the drain if they couldn’t injure or kill Lin Yun.

“Your plan is vicious,” Qin Yun said coldly.

“Isn’t it good this way? Otherwise, why don’t you help him bear the Blood Conceal King’s anger?” Jiang Ziyao smiled.

Qin Yun merely snorted and said nothing else. They looked at the Blood Conceal King, but weren’t in a hurry to make a move for the golden spirit core. These eyes flashed with murderous intent. They were geniuses, and they were decisive people. The moment they made their plan, they knew that they had offended Lin Yun, so they naturally wanted to see Lin Yun’s death.

After all, they didn’t consider someone from the Kunlun Realm to be on the same path as them, which was why they didn’t mind using such a vicious plan. They didn’t speak but had a rapport, wanting to see Lin Yun heavily injured at the very least to ensure that he was harmless before going after the golden spirit core.

If the Blood Conceal King could injure Lin Yun, they wouldn’t hesitate to make a move.

“What should we do?” Ji Zixi was anxious. She was young, so this sudden change of events surprised her.

“There’s no need to hurry. Lin Yun should be able to deal with the Blood Conceal King, so we just have to be cautious of the surroundings. Let’s leave this place first...” Lin Jiangxian said. Her words made Ji Zixi calm down.

“Mhm?” Lin Yun was surprised because he could sense that the saint aura the Blood Conceal King was releasing began to drop. It might seem like Lin Yun was running for his life, however, he didn’t panic and was probing the Blood Conceal King’s strength.

“It has come to an end here!” Lin Yun suddenly turned around and faced the Blood Conceal King head-on. His eyes shone brightly and became golden, unleashing his Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent. With Lin Yun in the center, a golden shockwave spread out, which was the Azure Dragon Sword Domain. At the center of the shockwave, Lin Yun basked in a golden radiance as he charged at the Blood Conceal King.

“What’s going on?” This scene made everyone’s hearts tremble because they didn’t expect Lin Yun to charge at the Blood Conceal King instead of running away. Not only those in the Nether Woods Mountain Range but everyone on the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain was also attracted to his actions.

Under the vast commotion, Lin Yun poured all the primordial aura within his body into the sword and swung it against the shackles. When the two forces clashed, cracks appeared in this battlefield. An unbelievable scene occurred as Lin Yun beame enveloped in saint radiance and cut the shackles apart, leaving fine cracks on the shackles, and the flames began to disperse.

“Dodge it!” No one dared to be careless and quickly dodged. When the sword landed on the Blood Conceal King, it stabbed the golden demonic runes.

But the backlash from the demonic runes made Lin Yun’s internal organs tremble with huge waves rising from the saint energy ocean within his violet palace. Lin Yun wore a grave expression while being envious of the demonic runes, which were even more effective than divine physiques.

“You’re courting death!” The Blood Conceal King was furious as he avoided the Flower Burial Sword and swiped with his claws-like blades.

Lin Yun calmly dodged the attack, while the claws left cracks in the space in its path.

“You can really run.” The Blood Conceal King wore a brutal smile as he raised the shackles with his right hand, and the shackles enveloped Lin Yun, sealing him entirely.

“Great!” Jiang Ziyao and Heavenly Book cheered when they saw this scene.

“He’s dead for sure now,” the other geniuses also became excited.

The Blood Conceal King had predicted Lin Yun’s location and set up a trap beforehand, waiting for Lin Yun to step into his trap. As long as Lin Yun stepped on it, he would be dead.

Sensing the surrounding danger, the Flower Burial Sword began to vibrate within Lin Yun’s hand, worried for Lin Yun’s safety.

“Calm down,” Lin Yun smiled. He had experienced multiple life and deaths with the Flower Burial Sword, and he could sense the sword’s feelings.

“This is nothing...” Lin Yun smiled, which made the Flower Burial Sword in his hand calm down after hearing his words with fighting spirits gushing out.

The entire world began to tremble under the sword intent, and Lin Yun smiled as he swung his sword. As a dazzling sword ray flew out, the Sword Domain tore apart the distorted space, sending the two shackles flying before Lin Yun charged forth.

“Blooming Stars!”

“Flower Seeking Moon!”

“Rising Sword!”

“Rippling Heavenly River!”

“Firefly’s Light!”

Lin Yun performed the third section of the Divine Firefly Sword with the Flower Burial Sword, with various phenomena overlapping. They were all Lin Yun’s figure, which the sword ray bloomed as the Divine Firefly Sword was pushed to the limit, leaving everyone dumbfounded.

“How is this possible?” Everyone exclaimed while watching this scene. They had never seen such an exquisite sword technique before.

“Is that the Divine Firefly Sword?”

“Isn’t this famous sword technique long-lost...?”

“But the legend didn’t state that the Divine Firefly Sword was so powerful.” Many cultivators on the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain recognized this sword technique, which shocked them even more, including all the present swordsmen.

“This sword technique... is simply unheard of.” All the swordsmen became emotional.

“What the hell?” Jiang Ziyao and others were stumped when they witnessed Lin Yun’s performance.

Lin Yun’s sword tore apart all the golden demonic runes on the Blood Conceal King, making the Blood Conceal King scream in pain as a demonic radiance shot out from his body. It didn’t take long before the Blood Conceal King couldn’t hold on any longer.

The Blood Conceal King’s face was ashen as he looked at Lin Yun. He asked, “What’s the name of this sword technique?”

His life was coming to an end soon, based on his injuries, and he wasn’t as insane as before. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The Divine Firefly Sword,” Lin Yun said.

The Blood Conceal King was briefly stunned, before he said, “I remembered it now. Before the Heavenly Path was severed, this sword technique was famous throughout the universe, but I never heard that it was so powerful. I have no regrets about dying in your hands despite preparing for so long.”

Lin Yun remained silent.

“You’re from Kunlun?” The Blood Conceal King smiled, “My Spirit Clan was also invincible in the Kunlun Realm, and you’ve escaped from it, right? I bet everyone in there is already reduced to livestock.”

Lin Yun raised his brow, and coldly said, “Sorry to disappoint you. Your clan was nearly slaughtered three thousand years ago, and they’re now sealed, even if they’re alive. They’re barely living, like rats in the drain. No... they’re more pathetic than rats in the drain.”

“This is impossible...” The Blood Conceal King became furious, looking anxious. “There’s no need to bluff me. You won’t live for long. You think I can’t tell that your own kind doesn’t welcome you? You will soon follow my path after I die... Hahaha!”

As the Blood Conceal King laughed, his body was ripped apart and the golden spirit core appeared. The Blood Conceal King didn’t have enough time to refine that golden spirit core.

The eyes of Jiang Ziyao and the other geniuses lit up as they flew over and landed before Lin Yun. The six looked extraordinary with their dao flowers blooming behind them.

Jiang Ziyao smiled, “Impressive, but you can leave now. You don’t have to worry about the golden spirit core.”

His tone was casual, as if he was dismissing his servant.
