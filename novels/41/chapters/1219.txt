Chapter 1220 - Beating!

“You’re really a surprise!” Zhang He slowly hovered in the air and looked down on Lin Yun with a smile, “You’re stronger than I imagined. The ranking battle is finally getting interesting.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun smiled with a playful gaze flashing across his pupils. Did Zhang He really consider himself to be the strongest? He had no idea where Zhang He got his confidence from when he was so badly beaten up earlier.

Zhang He’s Ghost Fire Battle Physique was completely crushed by him, and Zhang He didn’t even inflict any damage on his Azure Dragon Saint Physique. Then again, Lin Yun didn’t think that he would be pressured this much from the fight after reaching the Empyrean Realm.

“But you’re still the weakest and it’s practically impossible for you to win me with your cultivation!” Zhang He smiled and began to form seals with both his hands. When a painting unfolded behind him, Zhang He summoned his constellation. Crimson light spread out on the surface of his body, repairing the shattered demonic runes.

When Zhang He summoned his constellation, it brought new life to his Ghost Fire Battle Physique. Scales began to appear on the surface of his body with a pair of ghostly claws and crimson flames blazing in his pupils. It was a weird scene that caused his pressure to increase rapidly.

Lin Yun was surprised because such a demonic martial technique was rare to see, and the painting looked like a demon from hell.

As Zhang He’s bones began to shake, his physique began to swell. At the same time, endless flaming pressure swept toward Lin Yun, not giving him the opportunity to disrupt Zhang He.

But Lin Yun’s feet were firmly planted on the ground as his hair fluttered in the wind. Immediately, his sword intent began to surge.

“Ghost Fire Claw!” Zhang Ye’s eyes flashed with surprise. Then, he disappeared before he charged toward Lin Yun. His claw left cracks in the air that burned with crimson flames.

Lin Yun waved his hand and drew his sword. When his sword collided with the claw, sparks flew around the stage. As a dragon roar echoed out, Lin Yun’s sky sword intent had completely merged with his azure dragon sword aura, causing his aura to rise rapidly.

He was taking the attack head-on without budging an inch. Cracks appeared on the stage beneath him that soon spread out. Each of the terrifying cracks showed how powerful Zhang He was. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But Zhang He was surprised to see that his attack was actually blocked because he was expecting a complete suppression when he brought out his constellation. Regardless of how powerful Lin Yun’s physique was, he should be completely crushed by the difference in their cultivation.

As Zhang He frowned, he released a sharp roar that sounded like the roar of a ghost from hell. It sent bizarre soundwaves into the surroundings. Even if Lin Yun had a powerful sword intent, it still took a long time for the sword cocoon to calm down after buzzing for a long time.

Meanwhile, Zhang He charged forward because he refused to believe that he couldn’t force Lin Yun to take a step back. While he unleashed his attacks, he summoned his holy spirit from within his body.

“Sun Concealing Clouds!”

“Storm Clouds and Wind!”

“Clouds Manifesting Dragon!”

“Soaring Azure Sky!” Lin Yun took the attacks head-on with his feet firmly planted on the ground, not taking a step back no matter how Zhang He attacked him. As Azure Birds flew around accompanied by dragon roars, Lin Yun calmly executed the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords to the limit, leaving all the audience dumbfounded.

“My heavens, the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords is that strong?”

“Isn’t this a little too terrifying? Each of his swords have reached the manifestation stage!”

“Unbelievable! How is he the weakest? He’s definitely a dark horse!” The plaza boiled in shock at Lin Yun’s attainment in the sword.

“Holy…” The plump middle-aged man from the Heavenly Astral Pavilion couldn’t remain seated anymore as beads of sweat dripped from his forehead. After all, Zhang He was a genius even among all the empyreans in the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. He shouldn’t have an opponent in such a small place like the Profound Azure Prefecture.

But now, Zhang He was placed in a tough spot facing Lin Yun who was only in the Galaxy Stage. It made no sense to the plump middle-aged man at all.

The plump middle-aged man immediately felt a chill down his spine as he recalled the fear he felt from facing Flower Burial. As his lips twitched, he spoke with a trembling voice, “What the hell. Don’t tell me that we’re going to fail here again.”

It would be too humiliating if they were crushed by the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect before they could even find Flower Burial.

“It’s your turn to take an attack from me!” Lin Yun smiled. Before Zhang He could respond in time, Lin Yun took a step forward, which caused the entire stage to tremble violently. His body erupted like a volcano when he took a step forward as he poured his sword aura out. It instantly placed Zhang He in a difficult position. His sword intent was so strong that Zhang He couldn’t resist.

As 11 Azure Birds flew in the air, Lin Yun stood firm. It was as though he was the manifestation of a mountain, perfectly fused with the clouds.

“Eleventh sword—Emerald Stars!” Lin Yun took a deep breath and soared into the sky before swinging his sword out. His sword aura felt like a gigantic mountain was falling from the sky, causing the entire stage to tremble violently. Suddenly, countless blades flew out.

“This…” Zhang He was completely dumbfounded by this scene. By the time he recovered from his shock, a gigantic figure stood in the starry sky above Lin Yun and swung its sword.

When the gigantic figure in the sky overlapped with Lin Yun, a dazzling sword ray lit up the entire sky. Zhang He did his best to defend by condensing the flames into armor, but under Lin Yun’s sword, his defenses were sliced through like paper.

When Lin Yun’s sword came in contact with his scales, it left a bloody gash on his body and sent him flying. Zhang He let out a miserable scream from the immense pain as he yelled with a twisted face, “Lin Yun, I’ll kill you!”

“Not loud enough. Here, take another sword from me!” Lin Yun soared into the sky with boundless clouds surging behind him. When the sea of clouds was formed, Lin Yun’s sword aura became even more dense.

“Azure Mountain Beyond The Clouds!” Space around Lin Yun distorted and the sea of clouds was immediately sucked over with the 12 Azure Birds. When Lin Yun stabbed his sword out, it formed into a terrifying white vortex.

The vortex was unbelievably tough and the power made Zhang He feel despair. The scales on Zhang He’s body were completely crushed. The intense pain was unimaginable, and Zhang He’s scream made everyone feel uncomfortable. After Zhang He took the full blow of Lin Yun’s sword, all the scales on his body disappeared.

“Oh my god…” All the audience took in a cold breath because this was simply too brutal. Right at this moment, Zhang He suddenly dashed forward, and the demon that he had fused with from his painting separated with him. Then, it flew towards Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun’s sword aura collided with the demon, it passed through the demon as if it didn’t exist. At the same time, Zhang He, who was covered in injuries, followed right behind the demon.

But just when the demon was about to get close to Lin Yun, the golden aura in Lin Yun’s forehead turned into golden flames. At this moment, the sword intent contained in Lin Yun’s forehead was like a massive sky, and the demon froze in mid-air from Lin Yun’s glare. In the next second, Lin Yun’s sword intent instantly shredded the demon into pieces.

When the demon dissipated, Zhang He, who was still trailing behind, had fear written on his face as a sword ray passed his throat.

“I…I surrender!” Zhang He’s face was pale and he surrendered after sensing death. But Lin Yun waved his hand and used the flat surface of the sword to slap Zhang He’s face.

The sound echoed out, leaving everyone from the Heavenly Astral Pavilion dumbfounded. When Zhang He landed on the ground, he rolled away several times. Raising his head to look at Lin Yun, he could see the indifference in Lin Yun’s pupils.

“You know how to admit defeat now? Who the hell do you think you are to call me the weakest? You’re even weaker than a dog. Someone like you wants to take Flower Burial’s head? How impudent!” Lin Yun said as he sheathed his sword.

Since Zhang He came to look for Flower Burial, there was naturally no need for Lin Yun to help Zhang He retain his face. If it wasn’t for the rules, his sword earlier would've already taken Zhang He’s life.
