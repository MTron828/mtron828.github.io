Chapter 1532 - Curtain Falls

“We send off the Radiant Sword Saint!” All the Samsara Edict Realm experts raised their heads and said in fearful voices. The Radiant Sword Saint might be old, but his blood hadn’t dried up, and he still had his pride. Simultaneously, they all understood the Radiant Sword Saint’s words.

He wouldn’t interfere if it were to better the juniors. But if someone wanted to be shameless bully his disciple when they were a senior, he would kill that person, and that was the same even for a quasi-Saint of the Netherworld Hall. All the Radiant Sword Saint did was use a single glance, and Qiu Qiong was dead.

The forehead of Chang Cheng of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion was covered in sweat. He felt that he had just brushed past death. After all, Qiu Qiong was a quasi-Saint, but even he couldn’t resist the Radiant Sword Saint. He felt that the Radiant Sword Saint would start a massacre on this trip to the Netherworld Hall, and he could even predict the deaths of their saints.

So he was now rejoicing that he didn’t make a move against Lin Yun. The Netherworld Hall had a stronger foundation than the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. So, who knew how many people would have to die if the Heavenly Astral Pavilion clashed with the Radiant Sword Saint?

“Let’s go! Leave immediately!” Chang Cheng exchanged a glance with the other elders. They could see similar thoughts in each other’s pupils. They didn’t want to stay here for another second. They might have suffered an enormous loss here, but they believed that the those higher up within the Heavenly Astral Pavilion wouldn’t blame them for it.

It didn’t take long for all the demonic sects to leave, and the asteroid belt suddenly became spacious. It was hard to believe that a battle occurred here not too long ago.

“Master…” Lin Yun muttered. He knew that this matter really blew up, and he couldn’t imagine what would happen if his master lost more lifespan just to descend here with a clone. But since things have already taken place, it was too late for him to regret it. He just had to keep this grace in mind and try his best to repay the Sword Sect, hoping he could become a powerhouse like his master one day.

“That was the Radiant Sword Saint?” Xiao Yun scratched his head. “Just a clone is already so powerful…”

“You didn’t know about the Radiant Sword Saint?” An Liuyan was surprised when she looked at Xiao Yun. “Back then, a holy land wanted to expand its forces to the Eastern Desolation. The Radiant Sword Saint blocked the entire holy land by himself, slaughtering ten Saint Lords. That battle earned the Radiant Sword Saint the title of ‘Sword Saint.’”

“I didn’t.” Xiao Yun shook his head. For there to be such a powerhouse outside the eight clans, Xiao Yun had a feeling that it wouldn’t be long before his clan came out into the open.

“Big Brother Lin, thanks for your help on this trip.” Xiao Yun looked at Lin Yun, and he smiled, “I’ll tell Big Brother Xiao Fan about this. I bet he’ll be happy to hear about your news.”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because he had a strong impression of that white-haired bladesman. The other party said he owed him a favor.

“You’re not coming with us?” Lin Yun asked after recollecting himself.

“Hehe, there’s no need.” Xiao Yun smiled as he looked at An Liuyan and Lin Yun.

An Liuyan’s face blushed after being stared at by Xiao Yun, and she snapped, “What are you looking at?!”

“Hahaha. I’ll stop looking, then!” Xiao Yun laughed.

“Greet Xiao Fan on my behalf. I’m looking forward to fighting him again.” Lin Yun said.

“That’s for sure!” Xiao Yun smiled.

After Xiao Yun left, Lin Yun took out the White Dragon Bone from his interspatial bracelet. “Here, take it.”

“I don’t need it. You risked your life to get it.” An Liuyan shook her head.

“I’m only keeping it for you. Furthermore, do we have to differentiate ourselves so clearly?” Lin Yun smiled.

An Liuyan didn’t dare to look Lin Yun in the eyes. After taking possession of it, she replied, “I can’t take it for free. What do you want? I can give you anything.”

But Lin Yun pondered and couldn’t think of what he needed. After all, he had a massive harvest in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm and made enormous progress in his cultivation. So he needed some time to digest all of the harvest.

“There’s nothing that I…”

“Stop!” Lil’ Purple yelled from the sword box. “True Dragon Saint Liquid! You scumbag, did you forget about me? Did you forget about your promise to me after getting a new woman?!”

“I don’t really need anything. But if there’s any, maybe True Dragon Saint Liquid?” Lin Yun quickly changed his words.

“True Dragon Saint Liquid? That’s easy. How much do you need? I can get it for you!” An Liuyan replied.

“50,000 kilograms! 50,000 kilograms! 50,000 kilograms!” Lil’ Purple yelled out excitedly.

Lin Yun nearly threw out a mouthful of blood when he heard that because 5,000 kilograms was already an astronomical sum. He briefly pondered before he asked, “10,000 kilograms. Can you do that? I can also use saint fruits to exchange for them.”

“It’s a huge sum, but it’s nothing compared to the value of the White Dragon Bone. I’ll try and get you 25,000 kilograms. As for your saint fruits, you can keep them for yourself. Didn’t you say there’s no need to differentiate between ourselves so clearly?” An Liuyan said while rolling her eyes.

“Uhh… thanks, then.” Lin Yun was surprised because he knew that it was a vast sum.

“Hehe. I’m starting to like this woman.” Lil’ Purple smiled from within the sword box.

But when An Liuyan saw no smile on Lin Yun’s face, she asked, “What’s the matter? You’re worried for your master?”

Lin Yun nodded in response because he knew his master would stand out for him. The Netherworld Hall was the leader of the seven demonic sects in the Eastern Desolation, and they had a stronger foundation than the Sword Sect. So he would be lying if he said that he wasn’t worried.

“The worst outcome is just the destruction of a clone. Don’t worry about it.” An Liuyan comforted.

“It’s not the same.” Lin Yun’s gaze became grave, and he continued, “Let’s go, then.”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Seven days later, Lin Yun and An Liuyan arrived in Aquabarren City, the biggest city in the Eastern Desolation. Twenty-five thousand kilograms of True Dragon Saint Liquid was an astronomical sum, and it was naturally impossible for her to take that much out while in Azurerock City. So An Liuyan could only come to Aquabarren City.

“Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion… can you still return to the Heavenly Astral Pavilion?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s for sure.” An Liuyan replied. “The envoys are actually worthless. There should’ve only been five envoys left if everything goes according to plan. But everyone died, and this is good news for me. The factions in the Heavenly Astral Pavilion are complicated, and I won’t give up the faction I’m in because of Tian Jue. Not to mention that my clan won’t allow me to back off.”

Lin Yun already guessed that An Liuyan might have come from an Ancient Saint Clan. He asked, “So you’re now the Young Pavilion Lord of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion?”

“It’s not that easy. The clan behind Tian Jue and the factions behind the other envoys won’t give up so easily. They won’t give up their entry ticket to the Imperial Demon Domain so easily. But with the White Dragon Bone, there’s no need for me to go easy on them anymore. Perhaps I’ve been too benevolent towards them in the past.” An Liuyan replied. She suffered greatly at the hands of Tian Jue this time, and Lin Yun nearly fell into danger because of her.

So she naturally wouldn’t take this lying down, and the White Dragon Bone gave her greater confidence.

“Imperial Demon Domain?” Lin Yun asked with a light flashing through his pupils.

“That’s right.” An Liuyan replied. “You can only find the best demonic cultivation techniques in the Imperial Demon Domain. Back then, when the Heartless Demon Emperor destroyed the various demonic forces, he collected all the powerful demonic techniques to create the Heavenly Demon Canon. So the Imperial Demon Domain is the holy land of the demonic path.”

They were chatting amongst themselves as they entered the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion. Very quickly, the pavilion master for this branch appeared, and his eyes lit up when he saw An Liuyan. “Missy, you’re finally back!”

“This is my guest. Prepare the best cultivation chamber for him, and help me collect 25,000 True Dragon Saint Liquids regardless of the price. I want it done in ten days!” An Liuyan instructed.

The pavilion master was shocked when he heard what An Liuyan said. But he didn’t say much about it and only said in a somewhat difficult tone, “It’ll be hard to gather so much in ten days.”

“There’s no need to rush, as long as it can be done within a month.” Lin Yun interrupted.

This time, the pavilion master was really shocked because this meant that all of that the True Dragon Saint Liquid was for Lin Yun. He wondered about Lin Yun’s identity.

“Half a month then, five days more for you.” An Liuyan said.

“Roger that. I’ll go and get it done as soon as possible.” The middle-aged man said before leaving.

After Lin Yun went into seclusion, An Liuyan began refining the White Dragon Bone. Three days later, Lin Yun fused his dragon runes and astral energy to execute the Flicking Divine Finger, creating a dragon-shaped sword ray. After the massive dragon image began to shrink in size, it was then suppressed within his middle finger and emitted a terrifying radiance.

When Lin Yun flicked his finger out on the wall, it pierced through the spiritual array on the wall and created a dent of roughly three meters. The spiritual runes had melted from this attack and dripped onto the ground.

“I can finally fully control it…” Lin Yun rejoiced and was satisfied with the power of the Flicking Divine Finger. This secret technique had reached a terrifying height with the empowerment of the Blue Dragon Bone, and the power would further increase as time passed until he reached the Iris Sword Saint’s height.

“I wonder what my current ranking on the Elysium Core Ranking is.” Lin Yun muttered. Since there was still some time for the True Dragon Saint Liquid to be delivered to him, should he give the Elysium Core Ranking a try?
