Chapter 2424 - Blank Piece of Paper

Just when the Azure Sky God Lord moved, he stopped since Lin Yun was already wielding the Flower Burial Sword.

When Lin Yun held onto it, the restriction left behind by the Iris Sword Saint appeared as chains and wrapped around the Flower Burial Sword. But the most terrifying was the talisman on the sword, the heavenly dao decree left behind by the Iris Sword Saint.

“It’s too late!” The Azure Sky God Lord had regret in his eyes. It was too late for him to stop Lin Yun after being stopped by the Iris Sword Saint. In the next second, the talisman unleashed a terrifying power that tore Lin Yun’s Azure Saint Cloth apart, with only the divine runes inside still holding on.

Relying on the Azure Saint Cloth to momentarily withstand it, Lin Yun activated his Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique to treat his injuries. As he circulated the two sword sutras, two flowers appeared behind him, along with two Sovereign Constellations. He had released all his trump cards at this moment before he finally managed to withstand the power of the heavenly dao decree, forming a stalemate. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As lightning swept out from the yellow talisman, lightning began to flicker on Lin Yun’s body, but Lin Yun firmly held onto the sword.

“Holy shit.” The Azure Sky God Lord was shocked.

“Mhm?” The Iris Sword Saint exclaimed.

“You’re not nervous? What if he dies?” The Azure Sky God Lord asked.

The Iris Sword Saint didn’t reply, since he wouldn’t go as far as killing Lin Yun here. He considered that Lin Yun would want to take his sword before sunset. The heavenly dao decree would only inflict severe injuries and wouldn’t kill him. Even if Lin Yun died, the Iris Sword Saint could bring Lin Yun back as long as it was within a few minutes. But he was shocked that Lin Yun managed to withstand the power of the heavenly dao decree, which made no sense.

Lin Yun continued to resist the yellow talisman as the chains on the Flower Burial Sword slowly broke apart. The radiance released by the sword grew even more dazzling. But even with the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique, Lin Yun was injured.

But Lin Yun’s gaze was firm without a hint of hesitation, like an erupting volcano. When all the shackles finally broke off, only the talisman representing the heavenly dao decree remained.

Lin Yun showed a taxing look since the power contained within it wasn’t something he could withstand. The Flower Burial Sword was also resisting after sensing Lin Yun’s determination. But the heavenly dao decree was too terrifying, and it didn’t take long before Lin Yun began to bleed from his orifices. Even so, Lin Yun’s gaze was still firm, since that was his heart as a swordsman. At this moment, he didn’t want to make a choice and hold his will that his sword was his and not others to control.

He wasn’t allowed to touch the sword before sunset? So what if he did? Even if he couldn’t withstand the heavenly dao decree, he hoped he could fall standing and not because of someone’s words.

“He can’t hold on any longer,” the Azure Sky God Lord said, and he was prepared to make a move the moment Lin Yun was heavily injured.

“Since I left behind a heavenly dao decree, it’s natural that he can’t withstand it. But he won’t die,” the Iris Sword Saint said.

But a bizarre scene occurred as the surface of the Flower Burial Sword began to crumble, revealing a metallic body. Shortly after, glory spirits began to appear on the Flower Burial Sword, swiftly becoming a Sevenspirit Glory Saint Artifact under the confusion of the Iris Sword Saint and Azure Sky God Lord.

“That sword isn’t simple. It’s also unconvinced,” the Azure Sky God Lord said.

“So what can he do with the heavenly dao decree around?” The Iris Sword Saint remained calm.

But something terrifying occurred next as the Flower Burial Sword became a Sovereign Saint Artifact with the Heaven Burial Constellation appearing. Or rather, it was a Sovereign Saint Artifact to begin with. The sword made a breakthrough under the pressure of the heavenly dao decree.

When the Flower Burial Sword became a Sovereign Saint Artifact, a figure flew out from the sword and stood opposite Lin Yun, holding onto the sword as well. When the two held onto the sword, a fine crack appeared on the yellow talisman.

“Senior Southern Emperor!” Lin Yun exclaimed when he raised his head. Standing before him was a lingering soul of the Southern Emperor, and this was the first time he saw the Southern Emperor’s actual appearance. It was a handsome face that looked like blooming flowers, but it didn’t look feminine at all. Instead, there was an oppressive force that swept out from him as though he was a king.

“My sword can even sever the heavenly dao!” The two owners of the Flower Burial Sword made a move as the heavenly dao decree broke apart. When Lin Yun and the Southern Emperor drew it together, they looked at each other and the Southern Emperor smiled.

“I’m glad that my sword is in your hands,” the Southern Emperor said before disappearing.

“As you wish!” Lin Yun laughed as he turned around and unleashed a dazzling sword ray, cutting the Bodhi Tree into pieces before he carried on laughing, showing the heroic spirit that stands out throughout the ages, the determination to press on, even if thousands oppose, the domineering aura of that Sword Dao was the supreme among the three thousand daos.

At this moment, only Lin Yun’s laughter could be heard as the Iris Sword Saint and Azure Sky God Lord looked at each other.

“I’ll go,” the Iris Sword Saint sighed and went over.

The Azure Sky God Lord wore a smile since this was the first time he saw Iris Sword Saint suffering a loss, which was interesting.

On the cliff, the Iris Sword Saint looked at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze. He roughly guessed that Lin Yun would choose the sword over eternal, but he didn’t expect this outcome.

“Senior,” Lin Yun cupped his fists together, lowering his sword. His clothes were destroyed, but he still wore a smile on his face.

“Congratulations,” the Iris Sword Saint said.

“Congratulations, what? I only made a choice,” Lin Yun replied.

“Your Bright Sun Sword Intent has reached greater mastery, and you’ll reach complete mastery soon enough,” the Iris Sword Saint said deeply.

When Lin Yun examined himself, he rejoiced to see the sun within his sword sea being much bigger than before, and there was even the outline of a talisman. He smiled, “I didn’t think that much.”

“Have you thought it through? Sword or eternal,” The Iris Sword Saint said.

“Yeah,” Lin Yun nodded. He said without any hesitation, “When I drew the sword, I already had the heroic spirit that stands out throughout the ages, the determination to press on, even if thousands oppose. From today onwards, only the Sword Dao is supreme among the three thousand daos!”

Lin Yun’s thoughts were cleared, and he even felt he might succeed if he made a breakthrough to a Saint Sovereign now.

“Daos are classified, but not the technique. What does that mean?” The Iris Sword Saint asked.

“It’s determined by heaven and earth that daos are classified, and there’s no need to overthink it. Your choice is the one that matters. Even if you reach a dead end, you can open a path for yourself,” Lin Yun smiled.

The Iris Sword Saint was shocked since the answer brought him an even more significant impact than Lin Yun drawing the Flower Burial Sword.

“Did the Qilin Sword Canon give you an answer?”

“It’s a divine technique that opened my eyes, but it’s the experience that made me decide. I prefer doing what I like and following my heart,” Lin Yun said calmly. “Coincidentally, I already had a decision in my heart when I severed the Bodhi Tree, sorting out my martial techniques and forgetting some. Since you’re here, I would like your guidance.”

“What do you still remember?” The Iris Sword Saint asked.

“The Great Profound Sword Canon and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon are still around. As for sword techniques, I only remember the Yin-Yang Sword and Nirvana Sword Art. I have forgotten all my movement techniques. As for fist technique, I only remember the Yin-Yang Fist,” Lin Yun said. Not only did Lin Yun make a choice when he severed the Bodhi Tree, but he also smashed apart the shackles in his heart.

“You forgot about the Divine Firefly Sword?” The Iris Sword Saint asked.

Lin Yun nodded and explained that when he swung his sword at the Bodhi Tree, it felt carefree and easy for him.

“Have you noticed that you only remember those you comprehended and forgot about what you’ve learned?” The Iris Sword Saint smiled.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned, before he replied, “That’s true, now that you’ve mentioned it.”

He comprehended the Yin-Yang Fist and Yin-Yang Sword after grasping Yin-Yang Dao. This meant he forgot everything he learned, such as the Carefree 9 Swords, Divine Firefly Sword, Flicking Divine Finger, Sovereign Dragon Fist...

“It’s good that you’ve forgotten them. When you remember them again, you will transform.” The Iris Sword Saint took out a nine-colored Bodhi Seed, handing it to Lin Yun. “Leave it behind and forget again once you’ve reached the pinnacle of Saint Sovereign. This time, you must forget the Yin-Yang Sword and the Nirvana Sword Art.”

Lin Yun took the Bodhi Seed over and understood the Iris Sword Saint’s intention. Only a blank piece of paper could be drawn on, and Lin Yun was equivalent to a blank piece of paper now with a firm foundation. So he didn’t need to have any restrictions about drawing on it.

“There are two paintings here, containing Yin-Yang Dao and Nirvana Dao. Perfect what you remember,” the Iris Sword Saint handed two paintings over and left.
