Chapter 392 - My Sword, Never Regrets

Lin Yun went directly to the Gentlemen Union when he returned to the Sword Firmament Pavilion and he ran into Wang Yan, who was sparring with the Eight Vajras.

Wang Yan was chatting while in a good mood, but Lin Yun’s sudden appearance had startled him. But he soon calmed down because killing was forbidden in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Anyone who went against this rule would be killed, no exception.

If it wasn’t for this rule, Lin Yun would’ve been killed by him a long time ago. But he didn’t expect that the tables had turned. This rule that was protecting Lin Yun previously was his source of protection right now, not to mention that they were in the Gentlemen Union. There were hundreds of disciples here, so what could Lin Yun do?

“Sword slave, what are you doing here? Did you receive any approval to even be here? Get out!” Wang Yan glared at Lin Yun coldly. The Eight Vajras and the other disciples of the Gentlemen Union also came over.

On the other hand, Lin Yun was focused on Wang Yan’s eyes, which overlapped with the pair of eyes back in the Extermination Mountain Range in his mind. That alone was enough for Lin Yun to make his move.

When Lin Yun summoned his Flower Burial Sword and walked over, Wang Yan coldly barked, “You dare to cause trouble in my Gentlemen Union’s territory? Teach this sword slave a lesson!”

Everyone immediately drew their swords. But before they could draw their swords completely, a sword buzz echoed in the surroundings that instantly overwhelmed everyone.

When the Flower Burial Sword was drawn, it shined like the sun as it buzzed under Lin Yun’s quasi-xiantian sword intent. All the swords flew out from the hands of the Gentlemen Union and plunged into the ground. They were like servants paying their greetings to the king.

Lin Yun’s sword aura dazzled like the bright moon, which made everyone from the Gentlemen Union’s faces turn pale. The swords on the ground were ridiculing them, like a slap to the face. Aside from the Eight Vajras, only a few disciples managed to hold onto their swords.

A sword was a swordsman’s life. It was a great humiliation if one couldn’t even protect his sword. Wang Yan was simply a joke. How could he try to teach Lin Yun a lesson? After all, could ants kill an elephant? The numbers didn’t matter because no amount of ants could kill an elephant. On the other hand, an elephant could kill countless ants with a single blow.

At the very least, you have to be a wolf to kill an elephant. But it was a pity that all the Gentlemen Union’s disciples were no different than ants. Lin Yun was no longer the same person he was before. He grasped an ancient cultivation technique, the Aquaselenic Sword was in complete mastery, he had a quasi-xiantian sword intent, and his cultivation was now in the ninth stage.

Furthermore, Lin Yun was also proficient in the Dracophant Battle Physique and Dragon-Tiger Fist. His trump cards and means had long surpassed Wang Yan’s imagination.

Wang Yan had barely reached the ninth stage of the Profound Martial Realm and the second strongest in the Gentlemen Union was only in the eighth stage.

As the Flower Burial Sword buzzed, Lin Yun slowly approached Wang Yan. When his aura came crashing down on everyone from the Gentlemen Union, it made them feel greatly pressured. They were struggling just to remain standing.

The Eight Vajras that were next to Wang Yan were shocked. Their impression of Lin Yun was still influenced by when he was the fifth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. Back then, he had to rely on the Scarletflame War Flag to fight with them. However, in just a few months, Lin Yun had become a towering peak that they had to look up to.

“Lin Yun, are you trying to start a massacre in the Sword Firmament Pavilion?” Wang Yan was the most shocked. The entire Gentlemen Union had collapsed even before they began to fight. This was something that he had never imagined. He also began to panic when he thought of this possibility. Is Lin Yun here to kill me?

“Don’t let him come over!” Wang Yan could no longer maintain his composure and started running. He didn’t want to lose his life here. He had just done something great for the crown prince and he was destined to become the Wang Clan’s patriarch who would enjoy endless riches. He didn’t want to die to a sword slave.

“Get lost or die.” Lin Yun calmly looked at the escaping Wang Yan. Aside from the Eight Vajras, the other disciples were terrified and ran. They were all disciples of the Sword Firmament Pavilion and they only joined the Gentlemen Union because of Wang Yan’s generous offer. There was no way they would give their lives up for Wang Yan.

The only ones who were genuinely loyal to Wang Yan were the Eight Vajras. The eight of them were similar to the henchmen of the Wang Clan. They were only loyal to Wang Yan, not the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

“Kill us if you dare!” The Eight Vajras stared at Lin Yun as they held onto their weapons. They had no intention of taking a step back.

“As you wish.” Lin Yun swung his sword and the Eight Vajras died without even seeing how Lin Yun had attacked. When the eight of them collapsed on the ground, they instantly lost their lives.

This scene was seen by Wang Yan, who was running for his life. His legs immediately became like jelly, causing him to trip and fall to the ground. He used both his hands and legs to get up before running to the Lone-Star Alliance in a panic.

The crown prince and Bai Lixuan were both in the Lone-Star Alliance, so he would be safe as long as he made it there. But the moment he got up to his feet, he saw Lin Yun sitting on a stone statue in front of him with a cold gaze.

“Y-y-you…” This scene left Wang Yan dumbfounded. He still thought that it was an illusion. He tried affirming what he saw by turning around. When he saw no one behind him, he immediately looked forward, but Lin Yun was gone. Before he could even react, Lin Yun appeared behind him and stabbed his sword out.

Struck by the sword, Wang Yan was sent flying away. When he landed on the ground, he quickly got back up on his feet and ran for his life without even turning back.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun waited for Wang Yan to be a hundred meters away before he stabbed his sword. He wanted to kill Wang Yan, but it would be too easy to kill Wang Yan instantly. He didn’t want Wang Yan to die so easily.

Fifteen minutes later, Wang Yan was covered in wounds and the pain felt like he was being bitten by millions of ants. Wang Yan continued to run for his life while crying out, “Lin Yun killed someone… Lin Yun killed someone…”

This cry caused a huge commotion and the nearby disciples were shocked when they saw this scene. By the time he was in the plaza, there were countless disciples gathered.

Wang Yan fell into despair because he barely traveled one-third of the way to the Lone-Star Alliance. He crawled forward in pain and he roared at Lin Yun, “Lin Yun, what are you trying to do? Are you insane? We might have a grudge between us, but is there a need for you to kill me in the Sword Firmament Pavilion?”

“Do you recognize this?” Lin Yun took out a needle instead of answering.

“The Bloodrain Silverneedle!” Wang Yan exclaimed in fear.

“It looks like you have a pretty good memory, Senior Brother Wang…” Lin Yun then threw the needle out.

Looking at the needle coming in his way, Wang Yan suddenly exploded with unprecedented power and actually managed to dodge the needle. While he ran, he saw Bai Ting rushing towards him with the other elders. He immediately rejoiced when he saw Bai Ting because he knew that he was saved.

A sinister smile rose on his lips and he began to laugh. But the joy on his face soon froze when he sensed needles being inserted into his body one after another. The poison spread out within his body and soon spread to his internal organs.

Am I going to die here? Wang Yan never imagined that the needles he used would be used on him. In the end, karma was a bitch. The Bloodrain Silverneedles meant certain death as long as he wasn’t in the Violet Palace Realm.

“Sword slave, I’ll kill you!” Wang Yan roared and pounced at Lin Yun instead. He wanted to bite down on a chunk of flesh from Lin Yun before his death.

But there was naturally no way Lin Yun would give him this opportunity. He stabbed his sword forward and pierced it through Wang Yan’s forehead.

“Stop!” Wang Yan’s head rolled onto the ground before Bai Ting could finish. The elders following behind him were all shocked because no one had ever challenged the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s rules to kill someone in the sect, especially in front of the elders.

“How dare you! Do you know what you’ve done?!” Bai Ting pointed at Lin Yun with his hand trembling. He originally thought that he was fast enough to ensure Wang Yan’s safety. But he never expected that Wang Yan would be killed right before his eyes.

“I do. I just killed a dog, that’s all,” replied Lin Yun.

“Haha, you just killed a dog? Kneel! Otherwise, I can kill you right here without needing to report anything!” Bai Ting took a step forward and unleashed his pressure at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun sheathed his sword and looked at Bai Ting calmly, “The Sword Firmament Pavilion was founded upon swords. Like our swords, we are requested to never bow. As a disciple of the Sword Firmament Pavilion, why do I need to kneel to you? My sword never regrets killing someone!”

Lin Yun didn’t speak in a loud voice, but his voice echoed throughout the heavens. In the next second, he unleashed his sword intent and he took a step forward to face Bai Ting.
