Chapter 2294 - Radiant’s Lineage

There wasn’t any trick in Lin Yun’s attack. It didn’t contain any sword technique but pure sword aura. This sword was so fatal that even a Saint Sovereign would die if they weren’t careful. Under this dangerous situation, the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign was kneeling with his hands clamped on the Flower Burial Sword.

He was risking his life to find an opportunity to retaliate, creating a stalemate with Lin Yun, who had swung this sword with the intent to kill the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign no matter what. The reason was simple: if he couldn’t kill his opponent, the Azure Glory Saint Sword might risk his life and exchange lives with him.

While the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign was kneeling on the ground, he looked at Lin Yun with a sinister smile and said, “It must feel bad, right? If you can’t kill me, I will easily kill you!”

The sword aura slowed down after the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign managed to stop it. His face was cold as he circulated the Sun-Moon Saint Canon, unleashing his full power as a Saint Sovereign, and said, “Don’t think there’s nothing I can do to you!”

He was a Saint Sovereign with a high cultivation that far surpassed Lin Yun. While holding his ground against the pressure from the Saint Sovereign, Lin Yun slowly stood up. He wore a grave expression as his hair began to flutter under the violent wind.

If it wasn’t for the radiance of the Sovereign Constellation from beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven, Lin Yun would’ve been sent flying away. Even so, he wasn’t exactly in a good situation. With a huge sound, the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign went from two knees on the ground to one knee. This made Lin Yun squint his eyes with a decisive light flashing through his eyes.

“You’re afraid now? It’s not too late to beg for mercy,” the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign said.

Lin Yun indifferently said, “To be so arrogant even when you’re kneeling on the ground, you’re shameless.”

“So what? I can still kill you like killing a dog. A Saint Sovereign cannot be humiliated!” The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign roared as radiance shone in his eyes with a sun and moon coiling around him. The power gathered to his forehead, forming into a crimson ‘Ming’ word. His aura increased as he stood up, letting go of the sword and reaching for Lin Yun’s chest.

“Die!” The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s performance made everyone exclaim because not even a Saint Sovereign could dodge his attack.

“No!” Many people could already foresee Lin Yun being killed by this palm.

“I’ve been waiting for you!” Lin Yun had expected this and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron, dividing himself into two. Blood splashed as the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s hand pierced Lin Yun’s heart. But Lin Yun wore a sinister smile before he exploded. Then another him appeared behind the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign with the Flower Burial Sword piercing the latter’s heart.

Lin Yun threw out a mouthful of blood because when he thrust his sword, his clone exploded. This clone wasn’t just an afterimage but one with flesh and blood. This technique allowed him to gang up on his opponent, but he would also suffer a backlash if his clone was destroyed.

When his clone was destroyed, Lin Yun flew a few hundred meters back and fell onto one knee while the destroyed clone returned to his body. Everything happened in the blink of an eye, with everyone seeing Lin Yun down on one knee while a sword pierced the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s heart.

The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign lowered his head to look with disbelief at the sword that had plunged into his body and threw out a mouthful of blood.

Lin Yun was in great pain but still gritted his teeth and reached out, the Flower Burial Sword shot through the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s body as it returned to Lin Yun’s hand, supporting him from falling to the ground. His face was terrifyingly pale as he wiped the blood from his lips.

“It looks like I have underestimated a Saint Sovereign…” He expected the sword to damage the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s internal organs before using sword dao to destroy the latter’s body. But when his sword stabbed the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign, Lin Yun was shocked to discover that the latter’s internal organs were further tempered and enveloped in multiple daos. Aside from that, the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign even had an incomprehensible dao within his body. The latter’s internal organs had formed into a space that was bigger than it looked.

This was the transformation after becoming a Saint Sovereign, a height Lin Yun still hadn’t come in contact with. So his earlier attack was really dangerous. If Lin Yun was even slightly slower, his clone would have been destroyed before he could thrust his sword into the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign. This made Lin Yun unable to stop having cold sweat on his back after recalling the process.

I shouldn’t try to hold on if I can’t kill him after bringing out the Sovereign Constellation, since he’s a Saint Sovereign. Lin Yun pondered. He was bold but also a meticulous person. He might seem arrogant, but his heart was meticulous. Suddenly, multiple figures came over. They were all Saints from the three holy lands who wanted to take this opportunity to capture Lin Yun, but they felt that it was too shameless to do that.

Lin Yun turned around and laughed, “All of you can come together. There’s no need to talk about fairness with someone like me!”

The silver starlight of his Sovereign Constellation shone down. Lin Yun might be trembling, but he looked like a wolf baring his fangs. When he swept his gaze over, many people cowered. Lin Yun was weakened, but no one dared to take another step forward, with everyone shocked by what he said.

“Flower Burial is a breathtaking swordsman…” The Roost End Saint Lord wore a grave expression while watching this scene. However, Lin Yun wasn’t in a good situation because the Saints from three holy lands had surrounded him.

The Divine Phoenix Mountain might be strong, but they couldn’t assist Lin Yun. The Astral River and Jade Lotus Saint Sovereigns wore grave expressions, and even Ji Zixi looked anxious. In the end, the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign made a decision, and said, “Flame Cry Saint Sovereign, let’s end this matter here. If the three holy lands are willing to let Lin Yun go, I’m willing to hand over the divine flame fragment.”

The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign was decisive. Lin Yun was more important than the divine flame fragment, not to mention that the divine flame fragment was obtained by Lin Yun, to begin with. She continued, “The Divine Phoenix Mountain is willing to lower our heads in this battle. If you allow me to bring Lin Yun away, everything can be negotiated.”

After hearing what the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign said, an uproar came from the surroundings. They were shocked because anyone could tell that the Divine Phoenix Mountain had won when facing three holy lands by themselves. So, it was a huge price for them to pay to lower their heads and hand over the divine flame fragment. And yet all of that was for Lin Yun.

After hearing that, everyone had to admit that they would start to look at the Divine Phoenix Mountain differently. The Flame Cry Saint Sovereign fell into deep thoughts because he felt it could be considered. After all, the Great Saints from both sides might fight as well if this carried on, not to mention the Great Saints each possessed a Sovereign Saint Artifact that might bring this battle to an unimaginable path. So, what the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign said could be weighed.

“You guys started this but wanted to end it as you wish? We can let him go if his saint origin is destroyed.” The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign interrupted before the Flame Cry Saint Sovereign spoke.

“No one can bring him away today, no one!” The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign soared to the sky with his palm directed at Lin Yun. He was only a thousand meters away, and it was too late for anyone to reinforce Lin Yun at this distance.

Right then, a sword box descended from the sky, clashing with the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign and causing cracks in the surroundings. This made the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign feel his mind being shaken as he slammed onto the ground. But the sword box didn’t slow down and continued to descend, suppressing the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign.

As the floral patterns on the sword box lit up, the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign was completely suppressed. This scene left everyone shocked. But that wasn’t all. Golden clouds were drifting from the west.

The golden clouds looked like flames that surged towards those from the three holy lands, enveloping half of the area outside the God Burial Mountain Range. Beyond the golden clouds, a blurred figure could be faintly seen, giving off an ancient aura that struck fear in everyone. This was the suppression of a bloodline.

“Retreat!” The Flame Cry and Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign were startled before they retreated. They looked at the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign, who was reduced to minced meat, in disbelief.

“Who will wake from the dream?” A voice resounded as three light beams appeared, each giving off a terrifying aura. Three blurred figures were seen in the three pillars, and the aura released by them was ancient.

“Senior, who are you?” The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign carefully asked.

“I’m born before heaven and am eighteen years old, one year for each era.” A voice resounded that shocked everyone because this was a huge origin. Everyone began to discuss who this person was that awakened from the God Burial Mountain Range.

“Who are you? You have a name, right?” The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign carefully asked.

“A commoner like you want to learn about this empress’ name? Lin Yun is my successor. Give two slaps to yourself if you want to appease my anger. Otherwise, I don’t mind annihilating the three holy lands!” An indolent voice resounded.

The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign’s face changed and he was furious. Even the Flame Cry Saint Sovereign looked puzzled.

“Hurry up, or I won't hold back! I taught even the Ming Cult’s ancestor a hundred thousand years ago. Let me show you the true power of the Sun-Moon Seal!” Seeing that the Nether Cleanse Saint Sovereign didn’t do as he was told, that voice was enraged. A brief moment later, a sun and a moon rose to the sky.

The sun and moon looked realistic, giving off an ancient aura and terrifying divinity. The radiance of the sun and moon enveloped half of the God Burial Mountain Range, scaring the Saints from the three holy lands to retreat and no longer daring to encircle Lin Yun.

The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign was locked on by that aura, causing him to shiver with his eyes wide open in disbelief. “H-How is this possible?!”

The Sun-Moon Seal released by this person was much more powerful, enveloping half the God Burial Mountain Range with the aura causing his soul to tremble.

“Ancestor, I’m sorry!” The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign shivered, giving himself three slaps before everyone.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

This made the corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitch because he recognized that this voice came from Lil’ Purple. The Sun-Moon Seal must have been created with the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, and it managed to intimidate the Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign.

“At least you’re tactful. I’ll stop here, then. You guys can leave now.” Lil’ Purple held back her laughter as she dismissed the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, making everyone heave a sigh in relief since the power released by the Sun-Moon Seal was too powerful.

Earlier, when the sun and moon soared into the sky, everyone felt as if two stars were above their heads, making them feel great pressure.

“Brat, why aren’t you coming? You’ve put shame to my name since you can’t even deal with a Saint Sovereign,” Lil’ Purple said coldly, looking at Lin Yun.

“The Ming Cult’s ancestor was your disciple? I don’t believe you. I’m a great saint of the Ming Cult, Thousand Seal. So let me test your strength!” The Ming Cult’s Great Saint couldn’t hold back, wanting to probe the strength of this mysterious Empress. He quickly reached out in Lin Yun’s direction.

“Ye Guhan, you bastard! Even a Great Saint has come out, so how long will you keep watching?!” Lin Yun roared with his scalp going numb.

“Hahaha! Don’t worry. I have always been around.” A hearty laughter resounded as space began to collapse. Suddenly, Ye Guhan appeared before Lin Yun.

“My junior brother is my beloved. Thousand Seal Great Saint, don’t even think about injuring him!” Ye Guhan squinted with a smile as he pushed his palm forth. This surprised the Thousand Seal Great Saint, who was sent flying away under this palm.

“Ye Guhan!” The Thousand Seal Great Saint looked at Ye Guhan with shock. There were rumors that Ye Guhan had become a Great Saint. But wasn’t Ye Guhan too strong when he had just become a Great Saint? Not to mention that Ye Guhan had grasped space dao.

“Indigo Mirror Great Saint and Grey Elegance Great Saint, stop hiding. Let me take a look at you guys.” Ye Guhan raised his brow and laughed, “The three of you can come at me together. The Radiant’s lineage likes to fight with a disadvantage in numbers!”
