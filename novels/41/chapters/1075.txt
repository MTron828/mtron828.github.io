Chapter 1076 - Sword Scores

After putting Lil’ Purple down, she toyed with her braids and spoke with a serious expression, “Lin Yun, you have to promise that you won’t carry me up in the future or smack my butt. This empress warns you that the consequences will be serious if I get furious!”

After yelling, she continued speaking, “Back then, I only needed a single poke with my finger to destroy half of the 36 heavens. If it wasn’t for that one deity, I wouldn’t have destroyed all 36 heavens.”

“The sword canon,” replied Lin Yun in an indifferent tone.

Lil’ Purple retracted her fist and glared at Lin Yun, “Hmph, I won’t lower myself to your level. There’s no way you can comprehend the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon right now. I’ll be honest with you, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon is divided into three portions - the Divine Dragon Sword Score, Godly Phoenix Sword Score, and the core portion, the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Score.”

The fact that the Divine Dragon Sword Score and Godly Phoenix Sword Score weren’t the core portion surprised Lin Yun. “What’s the Dragon-Phoenix Score?”

“Have you heard about the legend of attracting dragons and luring phoenixes?” Lil’ Purple asked.

Lin Yun nodded his head because he had naturally heard about it. It was said that a long time ago, before the gods were born, there was a lady who was extremely versed in music, and she was unrivaled in it. In the end, her song was so divine that it even attracted dragons and phoenixes to dance around her before she drifted away and became immortal.

It was a legend, so no one could confirm it. However, it sounded fake. After all, dragons and phoenixes were noble existences so how would they dance around a mortal? Legend had it that not only were there dragons and phoenixes, but also divine beasts such as Qilin, Golden Crows, and Azure Birds who were drawn in.

“I can tell you that it’s real, and that I witnessed it personally in the past,” said Lil’ Purple while a reminiscent look appeared in her eyes.

“No boasting!” Lin Yun smacked Lil’ Purple on her head without any hesitation.

“Ouch!” Lil’ Purple held her head with tears welling up in her pupils. But once everything calmed down, Lil’ Purple said proudly, “I’m not boasting! This empress heard about it from a senior from the Divine Phoenix Clan, and the ancestors of my clan personally witnessed it!”

“Continue,” said Lin Yun.

“Hmph, I’ll speak. Why are you so fierce to me? There’s a legend in my clan that a divine ship will appear at the end of each era. The saint will blow the flute at the head of the boat each time, which will awaken slumbering gods, demons, dragons, and phoenixes…”

Lin Yun was greatly shocked when he heard that because he didn’t think it was real. Then again, Lil’ Purple might not know the truth with how little she was right now. According to her, the strongest move of the Iris Sword Array required music to fully unleash it.

If Lin Yun used it with his sword, he could only unleash about 70% of the power. But if he had music to go along with it, he could unleash 120% of the power.

After Lil’ Purple caught her breath, she continued, “Alright, I’ll move on to the sword canon, so listen well. Although you might not be able to cultivate it right now, it can at least expand your horizon. If you’re lucky, you might even be able to improve your sword intent to complete mastery. Hopefully, you can take another step in the Iris Sword Sutra and reach the sixteenth stage.

“I’ll start with the Divine Dragon Sword Score. When tribulation arrives and the exchange of each era occurs, the divine dragon will appear… With a sword like a dragon, one can level the mountain, break through the sky while summoning the wind… With a sword like a dragon, one can grasp the various dao such as imperial, wind, water, fire, heaven, and earth…”

Lin Yun was confused when he heard that because it was too profound for him. But he was smart, only focused on listening and not comprehending it. Without sufficient cultivation, it would be futile for him to ponder the meaning. But gradually, Lin Yun began to understand it. It wasn’t because he was smart, but because Lil’ Purple had simplified it. For a sword to be like a dragon, it needed a spirit, which was similar to holy spirits and holy spirit martial techniques.

Lil’ Purple made it simple and related it to the Iris Sword Sutra he was cultivating. At the same time, sword hums rang out around him as a dragon started to appear. Lin Yun could sense his sword intent improving, and that his sky sword intent was becoming more brilliant.

After Lil’ Purple was done with the Divine Dragon Sword Score, she went on to share the Godly Phoenix Sword Score. The two sword scores were extremely profound and Lil’ Purple’s words seemed to have touched the surface of dao, causing heaven and earth to resonate along with her words.

When she was done with the two sword cores, Lil’ Purple went on to explain the Dragon-Phoenix Score, which greatly expanded Lin Yun’s horizon. It turned out that music could also come in contact with dao. It was a concept that was unheard of to Lin Yun. As he started to relate it to the Iris Sword Sutra, he felt a whole new world open up to him. When Lil’ Purple was done, Lin Yun opened his eyes with a light flashing through his pupils. Light was shining from every inch of his body and his clothes began to flutter in the wind.

“Impressive, Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress,” said Lin Yun as he looked at Lil’ Purple. He could sense that his sky sword intent could reach complete mastery at any time.

“Of course it is. But you have to say my full title to make it sound more awe-inspiring,” said Lil’ Purple.

In response, Lin Yun smiled and stood up. Of the three scores, the Dragon-Phoenix Score shocked him the most. Immediately, Lin Yun began to perform the Iris Sword Array.

Seeing that Lin Yun wasn’t praising her, Lil’ Purple folded her arms and looked at Lin Yun unhappily.

The Iris Flower began to bloom under Lin Yun’s feet while strands of sword intent flew out of his body. With his sword intent, he was forming a massive sword array. Standing inside of the array, Lin Yun could sense that the surrounding space filled with sword intent that had reached an unprecedented height. “Revolve!”

With a single thought, 18 purple-golden dragon runes appeared on the surface of his body. Then, they fused into the sword array, making the surrounding space feel even firmer. In the past, Lin Yun didn’t have much time to comprehend the sword array. Only after spending time on it did he realize that he underestimated its power.

If he took time to comprehend the array in the past, he would have been able to face the holy spirits of the six Realm Sons. Lin Yun was filled with regret before he went back to work. Back when he had the Azure Dragon True Bone, he could manifest the Azure Dragon Saint Armor any time he wanted. Therefore, he never thought about the Iris Sword Sutra. After all, he ran into too many opportunities in the Heavenly Path and didn’t place much importance on the Iris Sword Sutra.

It made sense that he forgot the fact that he had only unlocked one seal of the Azure Dragon True Bone. He wasn’t truly invincible. There was no way the Azure Dragon Saint Armor could resist the attacks of the Realm Sons’ holy spirits at the same time. Lin Yun finally realized that relying too much on external items made one neglect their own strength.

Now that the Azure Dragon True Bone was extracted from his body, Lin Yun returned to his sword sutra. After all, the Azure Dragon True Bone was an external object that could be seized if he didn’t unlock all ten seals and merge it with his body. However, no one could take his sword intent away.

In a sense, there were pros and cons to losing the Azure Dragon True Bone. While he was in deep thought, Lin Yun roared, “Reverse!”

When the massive sword array began to reverse circulate, he could feel an immense obstruction that caused the surrounding space to tremble violently. He could tell that the stronger his sword intent was, the harder it was to reverse circulate the sword array. However, he needed to reverse circulate the Iris Sword Array or else he wouldn’t be able to bring out his full power.

“Break!” Lin Yun roared while his clothes and hair fluttered wildly. In the next second, a sword hum resounded in his ears like music while the sword array began to reverse circulate. At the same time, a dazzling radiance filled the entire space.

When a phoenix cry sounded out, the entire heaven and earth began to blaze with an immense pressure breaking through the boundary of the fifth soul, sixth soul, and seven soul Heavenly Soul Realm, heading towards the Empyrean Realm!

Although the pressure only lasted for a brief moment, it was so dazzling that Lin Yun’s eyes shined with excitement.

“Although you’re not proficient in it and it isn’t complete, it finally looks like the one I used in the past. I just so happen to lack a servant, so I can help you slay gods in ten years from now if you’re willing to be my servant,” said Lil’ Purple while nodding her head.

Since Lin Yun was in a good mood, he didn’t spank her. “I won’t be a servant. Just so you know, I’m still missing a daughter.”

“I’m serious,” said Lil’ Purple.

“Me too.” Lin Yun held his chin while examining Lil’ Purple. She only looked to be six or seven years old right now. She had flawless features and her hair was tied into braids. If it wasn’t for the fact that she loved to boast, Lin Yun would consider her the perfect daughter.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Dream on!” Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes and turned her head away.

Gradually, Lin Yun’s face became grave. According to what she said, he roughly had thirty minutes for his body to recover. He should have enough time to reach complete mastery in his sky sword intent if he tried hard enough. With a cold light flashing through his pupils, Lin Yun decided he would take back his Azure Dragon True Bone and more.
