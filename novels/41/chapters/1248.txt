Chapter 1249 - Who Comes?

Feng Jue was in an extremely pitiful situation and Lin Yun wouldn’t look for him even if Feng Jue had five million divine astral pellets. But five million divine astral pellets was a huge problem to him, and he would basically be crippled if he wasn’t at the Astral Stage against the top-tier geniuses.

“You’re right. I have to find a way to get five million divine astral pellets on the Profound Wither Island.” Lin Yun sighed. But he soon tossed it to the back of his mind because he had already made so many preparations.

It was just a matter of time for him to face those monstrous geniuses on the Empyrean Ranking. As he chatted with Jian Jingtian, Lin Yun began to ask about the secrets of the altar. It turned out that there were more secrets to the altar than he had imagined, and not even Jian Jingtian knew what was inside the altar.

“When are you planning to retrieve the thing in the Sword Saint Mountain?” Jian Jingtian asked. Now that Lin Yun had grasped the divine firmament sword intent, Lin Yun could retrieve the sovereign divine rune on the Sword Saint Mountain any time he wanted according to their agreement.

“After the Profound Wither Island,” said Lin Yun. He would need Lil’ Purple’s help to retrieve the sovereign divine rune, so he planned on retrieving it after the Profound Wither Island to avoid any trouble.

After leaving the altar, Lin Yun planned on taking a look at the Sword Saint Mountain. There were many Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s disciples on the stage cultivating. Ever since Lin Yun rang the bell on the Sword Saint Mountain, the stage had practically become a holy land in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Everyone could still sense the remnant dao sound under the Sword Saint Mountain.

When the disciples saw Lin Yun’s arrival, all of them had respect and admiration in their eyes. Lin Yun’s current fame had far surpassed Ye Ziling because of his unrivaled talent in the sword.

As Lin Yun walked on the stage, he nodded his head to those who came up to greet him. He even helped those who asked him for guidance about the difficulties they were facing. Lin Yun patiently clarified the confusion for everyone. Now that he had grasped the divine firmament sword intent, his attainment in the sword had even surpassed some elders.

So it naturally wasn’t an issue for him to answer the questions of the disciples. Right at this moment, there were some arguments coming from the entrance of the Sword Saint Mountain. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Jiang Lichen arguing with several youths.

Lin Yun looked at them and noticed that they were all dressed in white. They also had a sword enveloped in white clouds embedded on their clothes. In the mist, the sword could be faintly seen and Lin Yun could sense the existence of spiritual runes. This meant that those swords weren’t ordinary dao artifacts.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun asked.

“They’re disciples of the Sword Sect who want to visit the Sword Saint Mountain. The other senior brothers couldn't stop them, so they called Senior Brother Jiang over.”

“The Sword Saint Mountain is a restricted area, and they’re being too unreasonable even for disciples of the Sword Sect.”

“Without the sect master, who will dare to let them in? Furthermore, there’s no way they can climb the mountain without the sect master unlocking the mountain for them.” The other disciples spoke out.

So they’re disciples of the Sword Sect, no wonder their clothes aren’t ordinary. Lin Yun squinted his eyes because this was the first time he had seen a disciple of the Sword Sect. Were these people also here for the Profound Wither Island?

“Relax. The elders have already gone to seek the sect master. As long as the sect master allows it, we won’t stop you guys.” Jiang Lichen said in a heavy tone and everyone could tell that he had been getting frustrated for a long time. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Your elders are taking too long!” A Sword Sect’s disciple said with his brows locked together.

“As disciples of the Sword Sect, we have the qualification to climb the thirteen trials. Don't forget that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect is only a subsidiary force of the Sword Sect. Without the Sword Sect, it’ll be a problem for you guys to even maintain a footing in the Profound Azure Prefecture!”

“Everything in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect is given by the Sword Sect. There’s nowhere we can’t go,” said another Sword Sect’s disciple coldly.

“It’s not easy to open the Sword Saint Mountain, and even disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect only have one attempt. Even if you guys try to enter, it’s impossible for you guys to enter without the sect master around,” said Jiang Lichen while maintaining his manners.

“Thank you for your goodwill, but you have to remember something. Since when are disciples of a branch sect qualified to compete with those from the main sect?” The one who spoke was a short-haired youth full of pride.

When he spoke up, the other Sword Sect’s disciples became silent. They were only here for the Profound Wither Island and were temporarily staying in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Additionally, the sect told them they weren’t allowed to rely on their identity as main sect disciples.

Essentially, they had to maintain a low-profile, but it seemed like they had already forgotten about this.

“What do you mean?” Jiang Lichen questioned coldly.

The one who spoke was briefly stunned because he also realized that he was a little too much. But he couldn’t be bothered to explain himself and said, “What do I mean? Think about it for yourself. Just get lost. We’re going to visit the Sword Saint Mountain. Tell your sect master not to delay and unlock the mountain quickly!”

“What impudence!” Jiang Lichen became enraged seeing that they were so rude to Jian Jingtian.

“Impudence? Brat, don’t you dare think that you can talk back just because you’re the chief disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Senior Brother Qin Tian, is it okay if I teach him a lesson?” One of the seven disciples from the Sword Sect spoke out.

The youth named Qin Tian replied, “I’m also annoyed with waiting. If you can stop my junior brother in ten moves, we’ll stop. What do you think?”

“Ten moves? Are you guys looking down on me?” Jiang Lichen smiled from his pent up anger and said, “Sure, ten moves. Let me experience the skills of a main sect disciple!”

As soon as he was finished speaking, he pushed out his palm that surged with astral energy. So when Zhang Ting sensed the aura coming from Jiang Lichen, he was somewhat surprised, “Not bad!”

“But compared to me…” Zhang Ting wore a disdainful smile and returned with another palm. It only took a single attack from him to send Jiang Lichen flying. Clearly, there was a huge difference between them. “You’re still lacking!”

Zhang Ting laughed and left behind several afterimages. As he traveled in mid-air, he pushed both his palms out like claws. Instantly, he tore space apart and forced Jiang Lichen into a terrible state.

“Ten moves are up!” Zhang Ting smiled. A powerful storm of astral energy exploded as he pushed his palm out. Facing his attack, Jiang Lichen didn’t dare to be careless. Luckily, he wasn’t the same person as before, and it was all thanks to refining the divine dragon aura.

At this moment, he didn’t hold back. When the two palms collided in mid-air, Jiang Lichen threw out a little blood and took ten steps back. However, he wasn’t injured and his aura was growing stronger. As for Zhang Ting, he was forced to take three steps back despite having the upperhand. Although neither of them were using swords or constellations, it was hardly a fair matchup.

“Zhang Ting, you want to teach others a lesson with that strength of yours?” Qin Tian said coldly.

When Zhang Ting heard what Qin Tian said, his face became ugly. Although he held the advantage in the battle, it still wasn’t enough for him to deal with his opponent. In the end, he merely embarrassed himself.

A ruthless light suddenly flashed through his pupils as he disappeared from his spot. Jiang Lichen squinted his eyes because Zhang Ting was coming at him again even after the tenth move. He would suffer a loss if he had to take this move head-on.

But if he drew his sword, the situation would get much worse. Just as Jiang Lichen was debating what to do, a figure appeared before him and pushed out a palm towards Zhang Ting’s attack. From the huge collision, Zhang Ting was sent flying away.

Suddenly, a hand landed on Zhang Ting’s shoulder and negated all the force. Qin Tian ended up helping Zhang Ting out. Then, he looked at the youth in front of Jiang Lichen and said, “Are you also a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?”

“Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, Lin Yun,” smiled Lin Yun.

Upon hearing his name, all the disciples from the Sword Sect were surprised. That’s Lin Yun? He’s the genius we’ve been hearing about?
