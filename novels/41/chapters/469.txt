Chapter 470 - Curtain Falls

Compared to Lord Thirteen’s overbearing voice, this voice was more gentle, but it struck everyone’s heart because this voice was too familiar. They had heard it numerous times in the competition because it was naturally the princess. Her words left everyone shocked because no one expected that the princess would suddenly stand against her father.

“What did you say?” Emperor Qin turned to look at the Bloomphoenix Princess.

Without any fear, the princess replied, “Am I wrong? The Divine Guards won’t dare to go against your order, but did you ask yourself if those people want to take revenge for Qin Yu. Is it worth it if they die? What would everyone here think then?”

Her voice instantly caused a silence and many Divine Guards’ soldiers had an odd light flickering in their eyes. There was no doubt that they would follow orders even if they died since they were loyal to the royal family.

But if you were to ask them if they were willing? No one here was stupid and everyone could tell that Qin Yu deserved it. The competition had ended, yet he still tried to be unreasonable. As for his death, it was because he ran amok. Even a kid could tell what had happened.

None of them felt that it was worth it for them to give their lives up for Emperor Qin’s revenge. As for the audience, there was no way Emperor Qin could shut their mouths.

It was a miracle that Lin Yun came this far. He had gained a favorable impression in everyone’s eyes. So if Emperor Qin insisted on continuing, it would only ruin his name. When Emperor Qin sensed the surrounding gazes, his eyes sank down because the princess was suppressing him with the crowd.

“What an interesting show.” A rumbling voice echoed and two figures arrived. The one on the left was a middle-aged man donned in a purple robe. The one on the right was a young man in the Violet Palace Realm.

“Martial Uncle!” Ji Yun called out with joy. This instantly made the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s faces change. Didn’t this mean that this person was Qin Yu’s master, Hua Yunxu? He was a great figure from the Profound Yang Palace unlike Ji Yun.

“Greetings, Elder Hua,” bowed Emperor Qin.

Hua Yunxu nodded his head and turned to Lord Thirteen, “Jian Shisan, it has been a long time since we’ve met. You’re still the same as before with your arrogance, forcing a deacon of our Profound Yang Palace to kneel as you please.”

Without any signs, he pushed out his palm at Lord Thirteen and the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

Lord Thirteen issued a snort and his sword intent began to grow. With a stab, his sword ray radiated in the horizon and clashed with the flaming palm. Right at this moment, the shock everyone was feeling went beyond their description.

Aside from Emperor Qin, no one had expected that there would be another two Heavenly Soul Realm experts that would show up. First Jian Shisan and now Hua Yunxu. Normally, Heavenly Soul Realm experts were legends, so you wouldn’t even see them once in a decade.

“Hua Yunxu, are you insisting on poking your nose in the matter between juniors?” questioned Jian Shisan coldly.

“About that… I’m more qualified than you are. After all, Qin Yu was ranked within the top five out of all my disciples. I initially came to congratulate him for becoming the champion, but I never expected such a great show…” Hua Yunxu sneered, “First there was you and then there’s the fight between father and daughter. No wonder the envoy still hasn’t shown himself. If I was in his position, I also wouldn’t want such a great show to end so quickly.”

He waved his hand and pulled Ji Yun over. With a cold gaze, he looked at the latter, “Tell me, how did my beloved disciple die.”

This instantly made Ji Yun’s face turn pale while the Sword Firmament Pavilion wore a grave expression. They could tell that Hua Yunxu wasn’t weak and that Lord Thirteen might not be able to block him, not to mention that the Emperor Qin was still hanging around. If he insisted on capturing Lin Yun, there was no way the Sword Firmament Pavilion could stop him.

“Hmmm?” Hua Yunxu suddenly turned to look at Lin Yun, which made Lin Yun feel uncomfortable.

“Dual martial souls? That’s rare. No wonder you could defeat Qin Yu. Let me take a look!” Hua Yunxu smiled and disappeared. This made Lord Thirteen frown his brows and he quickly stabbed his sword out. Each of his attacks were dazzling, but Hua Yunxu appeared before Lin Yun like a wisp of smoke.

“Brat, come here!” Hua Yunxu laughed and grabbed at Lin Yun. Lin Yun was overwhelmed by the huge pressure that enveloped him and he couldn’t escape.

But just when Lin Yun felt that he was about to be captured, a figure appeared before Hua Yunxu. The two raised their palms together and collided, instantly causing a huge shockwave.

“Jian Xuanhe!” frowned Hua Yunxu. But before he could think more about it, a sword ray flashed as Lord Thirteen’s sword stabbed out. In the end, Hua Yunxu could only retreat.

“Hua Yunxu, you can’t take him away,” said the plump old man coldly. He was naturally the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Pavilion Master. This left everyone shocked because another Heavenly Soul Realm expert had appeared before them. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“So be it. I want to see how far he can go in the Draconic Banquet. But…my beloved disciple still died because of him, so I have to teach him a lesson,” said Hua Yunxu. But just when he was about to move, he suddenly sensed a cold killing aura fall on him. It didn’t come from Jian Shisan or Jian Xuanhe, but someone else.

Hua Yunxu turned his head and saw the princess staring at him with stars revolving in her pupils. This instantly caught him by surprise. Not only were there two Heavenly Soul Realm cultivators in the Sword Firmament Pavilion, but there was also a mysterious lady whom he couldn’t see through. Furthermore, the seals in her eyes seem to be related to ‘that’ ancient sacred ground.

In the end, Hua Yunxu spoke out in a grave voice, “Let’s go.”

Before anyone could react, Hua Yunxu had already left.

“He left so easily?” Jian Shisan and Jian Xuanhe were both surprised. They knew that Hua Yunxu was extremely protective of his disciples. Even if he didn’t cripple Lin Yun, he would ensure that Lin Yun would lay in bed for at least half a year. But he actually left?

“No need to bother with him. It’s time for this mess to come to an end.” A wisp of rage flashed in Jian Xuanhe’s eyes and he looked around, “It’s time for this show to come to an end, so why aren’t you showing up? How long do you want this mess to continue for?”

“What do you mean? I have always been around.” A voice echoed in the plaza. This was naturally from the envoy who hadn’t shown himself.

“Flower Burial Lin Yun, you can make a request since you’re the champion. I can fulfill it for you as long as it’s within reason. But remember that you only have one chance for a request.” The voice sounded out again. This time, everyone looked at Lin Yun with admiration. Everyone knew that the competition had finally come to an end because Lin Yun was about to make his request as the champion.

“Brat, stop dozing off. Hurry up with your request,” smiled Lord Thirteen as he stroked his beard.

Lin Yun swept out his gaze. When he saw Xin Yan, he revealed a smile and he spoke out, “Lord Envoy, I only have one request. I hope that the Senior Sister can regain her surname and that the Ye Clan can regain their freedom.”

He only had one simple request, so simple that no one had expected it. After all, his intentions had never changed since the beginning.
