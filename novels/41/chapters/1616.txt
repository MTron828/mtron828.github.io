Chapter 1617 - One Person, One Sword

The surrounding air was suppressed and distorted when the ancient dragon flew out from the Dragon Manipulation Monument and flew towards Lin Yun. Everyone could only see starlight shining in the sky and heard an echoing dragon’s roar.

Under the power of the Glory Saint Artifact, anyone at the same cultivation would die on the spot. If Lin Yun had taken this blow head-on, he would be heavily injured, despite his powerful physique. He had yet to reach the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. So there was no way he could withstand this attack, even with the Blue Dragon Bone. This was the power of the Glory Saint Artifact.

If that Silver-Eyed Demonspirit didn’t wield the Nether Saint Sword, it would be killed with a single blow from the Glory Saint Artifact. Right then, Lin Yun opened the umbrella in his hand, which gave off the feeling that a volcano had erupted, and the sky turned into a sea of flames.

This terrifying phenomenon covered the entire sky, making the three Glory Saint Artifacts pale in comparison. The Dragon Manipulation Monument was sent flying back, and Chen Tao could feel his soul tremble before throwing out a mouthful of blood. The Golden Vajra and the Demonblood Blade were also sent flying back by the barrier created by the umbrella.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“How is this possible?!” Chen Tao was dumbfounded, and his pupils nearly bulged. He couldn’t comprehend how Lin Yun obtained such a mighty Glory Saint Artifact. Even if the Sword Sect had one, it should be in the hands of geniuses like Gu Ruochen.

They had never seen that umbrella before. So, where did it come from? How could someone at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm wield such a mighty Glory Saint Artifact?

Folding the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, Lin Yun wielded it like a spear and charged at Chen Tao.

“Save me!” Chen Tao quickly retreated with his face pale. He was injured once more, and even if his bones were comparable to a saint artifact, there was no way he could withstand another attack. He panicked and recalled his Glory saint Artifact to above his head with unprecedented fear filling in his pupils.

Lin Yun opened the umbrella when their Glory Saint Artifacts collided and sent Chen Tao’s attack back. Not only did Chen Tao fail to obtain any advantage, the backlash had injured him even further, making his face even paler.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun roared.

Pouring forty thousand dragon runes into the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, the umbrella shone brightly and a constellation beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven seemed to have sensed the existence of the umbrella. The demonic clouds in the sky were torn apart and Lin Yun’s hair fluttered while wielding the umbrella.

The starlight shining from the sky was like two rivers that manifested into two azure dragons when Lin Yun swung the umbrella before flying toward Xiao Kui and Xuan Feng.

“Shit!” The two’s faces changed because they had never seen such a formation. They quickly used their Glory Saint Artifacts to fend off the descending azure dragons.

When the Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind Lin Yun, this made him look like a bright sun that instantly appeared before Chen Tao.

“Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple is here to see how strong you guys are!” Lin Yun roared, and his voice made the blood of everyone who was on the mountain boil. Everyone on the mountain could hear his words clearly, and they were extremely shocked.

Lin Yun wielded the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and used it like a hammer to slam against the Dragon Manipulation Tablet. Fine cracks appeared on the dragon coiling around the tablet under Lin Yun’s ferocious attacks, and Chen Tao threw out a mouthful of blood whenever Lin Yun slammed the umbrella against it.

In the end, Chen Tao quickly called out, “S-Stop! I admit defeat!”

“There’s no hold back in the Ancient Barren Battlefield!” Lin Yun’s face was cold as he returned Chen Tao’s words to him. When the tablet dimmed, Lin Yun smashed the umbrella on Chen Tao, causing fine cracks in Chen Tao’s bone. When another blow landed, Chen Tao’s bones were shattered, and he fell to the ground.

“I admit defeat!” Chen Tao yelled in pain.

“No one can humiliate the Radiant Sword Saint!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with killing intent as he swung the umbrella again. This time, Chen Tao pushed his Glazed Treasure Physique to the limit, and his body emitted a dazzling brilliance. But it was useless because Lin Yun wouldn’t go easy on him.

“Die!” Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind, and the purple diamond mark on his forehead made him look devilish. When his umbrella landed, Chen Tao only lasted for a split second before he burst apart like a smashed rock.

“No! No! No!” The faces of the Emerald Jade Manor’s disciples changed before they collapsed onto the ground.

“This…”

“Lin Yun killed him!” Everyone on the mountain was dumbfounded that Lin Yun killed Chen Tao.

“Lin Yun, how dare you!” Xiao Kui and Xuan Feng were shocked before they furiously roared. After all, Chen Tao was the chief disciple of the Emerald Jade Manor.

Lin Yun turned back and said, “So what? He deserves to die since he dared to humiliate my master. What’s the matter? You guys have an opinion about it?”

This scene made Xiao Kui and Xuan Feng’s hearts tremble with fear filling their hearts. Lin Yun’s voice wasn’t loud, and his tone was calm. But he had suppressed Xiao Kui and Xuan Feng based on his aura alone. When they came to their senses, they were extremely unhappy. Who the hell was Lin Yun to speak to them in this manner?

“Kneel!” But just when they were about to say anything, Lin Yun roared, and the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella in his hand opened up.

Pouring his dragon runes into the umbrella, it was like a bright sun soaring to the sky when he opened it up. The sun instantly enveloped this entire region, dazzling Xiao Kui and Xuan Feng. Under the umbrella, Lin Yun was like a deity, with his aura suppressing them. This aura was something that they couldn’t withstand, and they fell to their knees before they could even respond.

“How is this possible?!” Xiao Kui and Xuan Feng were shocked because the Glory Saint Artifacts in their hands were pale in comparison, and they couldn’t unleash any of the power of their Glory Saint Artifacts.

Wielding the umbrella, Lin Yun teleported and appeared before the two of them. Closing the umbrella, Lin Yun thrust it at Xuan Feng’s chest. This instantly destroyed Xuan Feng’s saint armor, and it didn’t take long for the umbrella to pierce through Xuan Feng’s heart.

This made Xuan Feng widen his eyes in disbelief, looking at his chest before turning to Lin Yun with shock in his pupils.

“Y-You dare to kill me…” Xuan Feng muttered with disbelief.

“Why don’t I dare?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. “Since you didn’t put the Radiant Sword Saint in your eyes and dared to make a move against me, why don’t I dare to kill you?”

But Xuan Feng, the Vajra Monastery’s Blade-Wielder, was still in disbelief and roared, “How dare you! I’m the Vajra Monsatery’s Blade Wielder. So what if I dare to make a move against you? Your Sword Sect is on the verge of destruction, and you still dare to make more enemies for your sect? The Radiant Sword Saint is a dead person. So what if I don’t put him in my eyes?!”

He was still in disbelief. Did Lin Yun really think that the Sword Sect was first in the Ancient Barren Domain?

But Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with him and circulated the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella once more. Xuan Feng’s body exploded with blood splashing around. This caught Xiao Kui by surprise. Before he came to his senses, Xuan Feng’s blood splattered on his face.

“Xuan Feng is also dead!” Everyone on the mountain was shocked, and their jaws nearly fell off. After all, Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to kill Xuan Feng and Chen Tao.

When Cang Yun saw this scene from afar, he was shocked and could feel a chill run down his spine. Recalling what he had previously said to Lin Yun, he felt he had brushed past death. Fortunately, he didn’t have any killing intent against Lin Yun earlier, or he would be dead by now.

“He is a really weird fellow.” Cang Yun’s lip twitched. After all, Lin Yun had given him the Azure Dragon Grasp earlier, but he didn’t even hesitate to kill Xuan Feng. Was this what it meant to be a swordsman? He didn’t care what others thought of him. He just did not need to let his sword down.

“You madman!” Xiao Kui stood up after he came to his senses. But Lin Yun opened the umbrella and Xiao Kui fell to his knees again. Throwing out a mouthful of blood, he raised his head to look at Lin Yun with despair.

But Lin Yun didn’t waste time with him and closed the umbrella before using it as a spear to stab at Xiao Kui’s chest. This made Xiao Kui throw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying a hundred meters back.

He felt uneasy before he came to his senses and realized that he was still alive. Lowering his head to look at his chest, he was shocked that his chest wasn’t pierced through. Xiao Kui naturally wouldn’t think Lin Yun couldn’t accomplish it, so he muttered, “You…”

“My senior sister said that if we run into disciples of the Heavenly Blade Pavilion and Heavenly Note Sect, we can go easy on them. You might have forgotten about that agreement, but I still remember it. You can get lost now.” Lin Yun said. He didn’t take Xiao Kui’s life, but he also didn’t want to look at Xiao Kui for a second longer. Stowing the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, Lin Yun walked toward the two corpses and took their interspatial bracelets.

“The Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella is really useful.” Lin Yun looked at his umbrella with flames blazing in the depths of his pupils. The Flower Burial Sword was also a Glory Saint Artifact, but it would exhaust more of his dragon origin if he used it. Meanwhile, he only needed to use his dragon runes on the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, and he could still flee even if he couldn’t suppress the three chief disciples.

His cultivation was still too low, and he would have no path of retreat if he failed to suppress the three chief disciples after using the Flower Burial Sword. But reality proved that his choice wasn’t wrong.In that earlier battle, he nearly broke the first restriction on the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

Lin Yun then disappeared, leaving behind all the shocked disciples, and what Lin Yun said earlier still echoed in their ears.

Lin Yun protected the Radiant Sword Saint’s prestige with one person and one sword, granting death to those who humiliated his master.
