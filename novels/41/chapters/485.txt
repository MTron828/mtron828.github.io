Chapter 486 - Deep Night

Lu Siyin couldn’t move her wrist no matter how she struggled. Her face immediately became dark and she barked, “You piece of trash. Are you courting death?”

“Sword slave, release Senior Sister Lu right this moment!” Leng Feng’s eyes flashed with killing aura as he drew his weapon. This signaled everyone else to draw their swords as well.

Seeing this scene, Lu Siyin calmed down and sneered, “You’re pretty courageous. Who are you to interfere in me reprimanding this lass? Why don’t you try and touch me once more, you trash!”

Lin Yun sneered inwardly. At such a close distance, he had more than ten ways of killing Lu Siyin. Even if he had only recovered 70% of his injuries, he could still leave safely after killing her. He didn’t know where she got the courage to speak to him in such a tone.

“Big Brother Lin, let Senior Sister Lu go.” Bai Yi was startled by Lin Yun’s actions and immediately calmed him down.

Looking at Bai Yi, Lin Yun sighed inwardly. She was still too soft.

“You’re courting death!” But the moment he released his grip, Lu Siyin stabbed her sword scabbard at Lin Yun’s chest.

“No!” Bai Yi’s face changed and she stood before Lin Yun. The scabbard struck Bai Yi’s chest, which made Bai Yi groan out in pain. This scene surprised many people.

“Idiot,” sneered Lu Siyin.

“Don’t!” Bai Yi immediately grabbed onto Lin Yun and she squeezed out a smile, “Big Brother Lin, calm down. I’m fine.”

Lin Yun bit his lip and he swept a glance at Lu Siyin. This instantly made Lu Siyin feel a chill run down her spine as she felt the boundless killing aura focused on her, which made her tremble.

“What’s going on?!” Liu Yunyan came out right at this moment.

“Senior Sister Liu, this piece of trash wants to follow us down the boat so I taught him a lesson. But who knew that Junior Sister Bai would step forward and take the attack for him,” sighed Lu Siyin.

Interesting… Lin Yun’s face was grim as the corner of his lips raised. He was rather impressed by Lu Siyin’s ability to make bogus claims.

“That’s not it. Big Brother Lin didn’t beg me. I’m just afraid that there’s no one to take care of him on the boat. After all, it has only been two days…” Bai Yi whispered as she tried to get up. But the pain made her lips twitch in pain.

Liu Yunyan’s eyes flashed with a light as she came up to check on Bai Yi’s injuries. Shortly after, she turned to look at Lu Siyin which made Lu Siyin start panicking.

“This ‘lesson’ of yours is pretty heavy,” said Liu Yunyan without any expression on her face.

“I’m sorry,” said Lu Siyin with her head lowered.

Liu Yunyan snorted and she turned to Lin Yun, “You can come along. But you’re not allowed to act on your own without my permission.”

“Thank you, Senior Sister,” chuckled Bai Yi as she rubbed her wound.

“Lin Yun, come with me,” said Liu Yunyan as she turned around.

“Big Brother Lin…” said Bai Yi.

“Don’t worry about me,” said Lin Yun as he followed behind Liu Yunyan.

When they came to a quiet corner, Liu Yunyan looked at Lin Yun, “You’re rather fixated on your sword.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he instantly understood what was going on. Liu Yunyan must’ve felt that he lied to Bai Yi and begged her to bring him on purpose before ‘stealing’ his sword back.

“You can think however you like,” said Lin Yun. He didn’t have any interest in arguing. He could just get all his items back when he recovered his injuries before leaving. He didn’t want to stay here for a moment longer. However, he just couldn’t help but worry about Bai Yi, that silly lass.

“This is 50 third grade spiritual jades. Consider it my compensation,” said Liu Yunyan calmly.

This made Lin Yun surprised because Liu Yunyan was rather generous. She was truly worthy of being a disciple of a quasi-overlord force. After all, third grade spiritual jades were extremely precious. If he had so many resources, he could’ve finished refining his sword energy by now.

“You’re not willing to part with it?” Liu Yunyan took the spiritual jades back and said, “I’ll get Siyin to return you the sword after this mission. Consider it as me owing you one.”

Mission? Lin Yun instantly understood what Liu Yunyan was trying to do. She must’ve felt that Lu Siyin would be stronger with the Flower Burial Sword, so she would contribute more. It looks like Liu Yunyan was pretty concerned about the Indigoflame Goldlotus.

But she must be joking to think that Lu Siyin could unleash the power of the Flower Burial Sword. The sword had already acknowledged him as the owner, so he was the only one who could use it in this world. Even if someone else took it, there was no way he or she could bring out its power.

“Miss Liu, I’ll be honest with you. It’s not just the Flower Burial Sword,” said Lin Yun. “Aside from the Flower Burial Sword, I also lost a Heavenly Soul Realm beast core, a high rank cosmic artifact, an ancient secret artifact, and a painting to Lu Siyin.”

Liu Yunyan’s face changed and she looked at Lin Yun with disappointment, “Do you think I’ll believe you?”

“You can choose to believe whatever you want,” said Lin Yun as he tugged his arms together.

But Lin Yun’s actions had enraged Liu Yunyan. She had already lowered herself as the Heavenly Province Academy’s elite to talk to Lin Yun, but Lin Yun still treated her for a fool. After all, how could a sword slave possess so many treasures? Did he take her for a fool?

Liu Yunyan spoke out coldly, “Then you can follow. But don’t let me discover any actions from you. Otherwise, I won’t let you off easily, even for Bai Yi’s sake.”

Right at this moment, there was a commotion on the deck. When Lin Yun turned his head over, he saw a boat with a blood wing emblem on its flag. Many young cultivators emitting demonic aura stood on the deck.

“The Bloodwing Pavilion!” Liu Yunyan’s face changed as she immediately stepped forward.

“The Bloodwing Pavilion is actually here!”

“They’re really annoying like pests.” The Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples all wore a grave expression. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Who are they?” Lin Yun asked Bai Yi. A youth donned in crimson clothing stood on the boat with a faint smile on his lips that made him look eerie.

“They’re from the Bloodwing Pavilion. The one leading them is Pan Yue, a high ranking disciple in the Bloodwing Pavilion. His cultivation is in the lesser Yin stage,” explained Bai Yi. “Our sects have always had a bad relationship. This is troublesome now.”

Lin Yun merely nodded his head. He looked at Pan Yue briefly and shifted his gaze away. Behind Pan Yue stood a black-clothed man with his face covered in a mask. If it wasn’t for Lin Yun’s keen sense, he would’ve neglected that person.

“Liu Yunyan, you’re pretty fast. I nearly lost track of you,” said Pan Yue with a dense smile on his face.

“So what if you caught up to me? Talk after you snatch the Indigoflame Goldlotus,” said Liu Yunyan.

“Let’s wait and see then!” laughed Pan Yue. When he turned around, his eyes were dark. The Bloodwing Pavilion’s boat soon disappeared from everyone’s sight, but their appearance was like dark clouds that loomed over everyone’s hearts. They knew that the journey wouldn’t be smooth.

When everyone got off the boat, they began to cautiously travel through the forest. As they gradually went deeper into the Bloodbone Mountain Range, they started to encounter more demonic beasts. But those demonic beasts were rather easy to deal with.

When dusk arrived, Liu Yunyan chose to set up a camp for the night. Lin Yun was leaning against an ancient tree as he watched everyone working. Some of the disciples were even setting up spiritual runes and traps in the surroundings for defence. Everything was smoothly put into place under Liu Yunyan’s instructions.

She was rather capable, but Lin Yun wouldn’t help because he knew that she didn’t like him.

My injuries are almost healed, but I converted 70% of my origin energy. If I can convert 100% of it into sword energy, I’ll have a 50% chance of winning even when facing a greater Yin stage expert. Lin Yun pondered inwardly. In the end, there was nothing he could do because he didn’t have any resources. If he had enough third grade spiritual jades, not only could he heal up from his injuries faster, but he could also refine more of his origin energy into sword energy.

“Big Brother Lin.” Bai Yi’s head came out of the tent. She first looked around before she looked at Lin Yun with a smile, “Come in for a bit.”

“What are you trying to do?” Lin Yun rubbed his nose in confusion. The other disciples were busy with their affairs, so no one noticed him.

“Here, for you,” said Bai Yi as she took out a pile of third grade spiritual jades. There were at least seventy of them.

“This is…” Lin Yun was even more baffled.

“Big Brother Lin, I’ve seen you secretly cultivating the past few days. You must be trying to recover your strength, right? Senior sister said that your injuries are serious, so it should be hard for you to recover. I can’t help you with it, but you can have these spiritual jades,” said Bai Yi.

Lin Yun felt his nose becoming sour and he smiled bitterly, “Your senior sister already said that I’m a cripple. Why are you giving me so many spiritual jades? Won’t they go to waste?”

“How can it be? Even if you can’t recover your strength with them, you can still nourish your body,” said Bai Yi. She forcibly handed the spiritual jades to Lin Yun and smiled while shaking her interspatial pouch, “Furthermore, I still have some more. I saved many of the spiritual jades given to me by the academy.”

“Thank you.” Lin Yun ultimately accepted them because he urgently needed them.

“No need to thank me. I’m also happy that you can recover your strength,” said Bai Yi with her face blushed as she waved her hand.

After coming out of the tent, Lin Yun looked at the interspatial pouch with many emotions. “That lass has no idea how great of a help she was. I need to focus on refining them tonight.”

Lin Yun looked for a remote corner and started to refine the third grade spiritual jades. When he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, he could sense pure spiritual energy flowing into his body that was absorbed by the Iris Flower. Shortly after, a satisfying feeling spread over his body. His profound veins were repairing at a visible speed.

His Dracophant Battle Physique had strong healing speed, not to mention that he had many third grade spiritual jades now. But his ambition didn’t just end with recovering his injuries. He wanted to refine all the spiritual jades and convert all his origin energy into sword energy.

Half an hour later, Lin Yun opened his eyes. He had refined all the spiritual jades and his eyes glowed brightly in the dark. All of the seventy third grade spiritual jades had been reduced to ashes.

“Just a little more…” Lin Yun had only refined 90% of his origin energy after exhausting all the spiritual jades. But he was confident that he wouldn’t be in a terrible spot if he faced a greater Yin stage expert. As for lesser Yin stage experts, he could crush them easily.

Then again, he was even more happy that he had recovered from his injuries fully. Not only did he recover his strength, but his strength reached a whole new level. When he clenched his fist together, he could sense the power coursing through his body.

Suddenly, Lin Yun’s eyes flickered and he turned in a specific direction. A violent aura was coming from that direction, which disrupted the silence of the night.

This made all the disciples’ faces change as they opened their eyes. Someone yelled out, “Demonic beasts! The demonic beasts are going berserk!”

The startling cries instantly woke everyone up.

“What is to come will eventually come,” muttered Lin Yun as he looked at Bai Yi’s tent. He didn’t care about these people’s death, but no one could harm Bai Yi with him around!
