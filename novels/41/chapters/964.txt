Chapter 965 - No Corpses Left Behind

“The Constellation Dragon Locking Array? Is this why all of you are confident?” Lin Yun squinted his eyes before raising his head to look at the sky. There were ten beast cores enveloped in runes. With all the spiritual runes, they looked like bright stars in the sky.

Lin Yun knew how terrifying the array was since it was capable of suppressing the Gold-furred Demonic Ape. Now, the array was a lot stronger than before.

From the outside, the crimson barrier looked unbreakable. With its black chains, the array even flashed between states of illusion and reality. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As the chains intertwined together, Lin Yun could sense his sword aura getting restricted. On top of that, the flow of his origin energy became slow. Although Lin Yun unlocked his feet from his breakthrough, he didn’t have any time to practice the Ten Profound Steps. So he was only able to move a little faster. However, it couldn’t provide any assistance against the shackles.

The spectators were shocked by the turn of events.

“The Constellation Dragon Locking Array!”

“No wonder it took Mu Ziyi two days to set up the array. It seems like fourth-grade spiritualists can’t be underestimated…”

“Lin Yun is definitely near the top of the pyramid in the Azure Dragon Region since he dealt with them using one attack. I wonder if he has any odds of winning against this array.”

“He should escape. He’s only in the second soul Heavenly Soul realm. But if he’s able to make another breakthrough, no one here will be able to stop him.”

“Hard. Liu Mu spent so much effort setting up this net. How can they let him escape?”

As the aura from the Constellation Dragon Locking Array grew even stronger, the faces of the spectators became grave. Wiping the blood off of his lips, Liu Mu looked at Lin Yun who was restricted in the array and sneered, “Surprised? Didn’t I tell you that you were going to die? I spent a lot of effort setting up this net for you, so what are you going to do?”

“I bet you guys paid a huge price to set up this array. I can’t believe you think so highly of me…” smiled Lin Yun. He was somewhat surprised by the appearance of the array, but that was all.

If someone else were facing the array, they would be seriously harmed. But the spiritual sword intent could cut through the void. All Lin Yun needed to do was to use the pinnacle spiritual sword intent to break the array. Furthermore, his array was actually in the sky sword intent.

Greed flashed in Mu Ziyi’s eyes and smiled, “You think we don’t know your secret? We know that you have a lot of divine astral pellets on you. When we kill you, we’ll be able to get everything back along with an advanced fortune martial technique and greater dao artifact. Haha, I can’t wait to get my hands on your treasures.”

They knew that Lin Yun was going to face them head-on with his cultivation, which meant that his foundation was built upon many divine astral pellets. In the entire Azure Dragon Region, aside from the seven heads, no one else had as many divine astral pellets as Lin Yun.

Liu Mu grinned, “If we can’t kill you today, you’ll cause us trouble sooner or later. Do you really think that we’ll give you the opportunity to kill us in the future?”

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun laughed with cold eyes. “Well said. But who knows what will happen.”

“You’re finished, Lin Yun.” Liu Mu’s gaze became eerie as he snorted, “Mo Yan, Xu Que, why aren’t you guys using your trump cards?”

“Hehe, you don’t have to remind us.” Mo Yan grinned with a frantic expression as fires blazed in his eyes. At this moment, he pushed his Crimsonblood Demonic Art to the limit. Then, a terrifying chill exploded out of his body as he turned into a monster.

Xu Que hesitated briefly before he took out the Demon Bale Pellet. It pushed his potential to the limit while a black demonic aura leaked out of his pores.

“Crimson Demon Armored Deity!” Liu Mu threw up a mouthful of blood essence as his face paled. Forming seals with his hands, a gigantic demonic deity with crimson armor appeared. No one dared to hold back anymore.

“Kill!” Liu Mu attacked and threw a punch that his demonic deity mirrored. The air instantly exploded as if a colossal mountain was falling towards Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun didn’t panic. Instead, he circulated his aura oceans and faced Liu Mu head-on.

“Hmph.” Mu Ziyi’s seals began to change as shackles shot at Lin Yun like spears. He couldn’t afford to let Lin Yun accumulate origin energy.

When the punches collided, Lin Yun was sent flying. And before he could even react, Mo Yan charged towards Lin Yun, “Die!”

With shackles targeting him, Lin Yun had to focus on dodging. So he didn’t have enough time to accumulate his strength to face Mo Yan’s attack. He was left in a pretty terrible state when he was knocked back.

“Demon Cloud Blade!” Xu Que stomped his foot in the air and swung his hand that emitted dense demonic light. The light manifested into the shape of a sword and swiftly approached Lin Yun. He would be greatly weakened if he were struck.

“Star Rage!” Just as Lin Yun was about to retaliate with his sword aura, Mu Ziyi snickered. The ten stars in the sky shined brightly and enveloped Lin Yun. When Lin Yun was enveloped by the beams, it felt as though he was carrying a mountain on his back.

Seeing that the blade was about to reach him, Lin Yun didn’t panic. He focused his sword intent in his eyes and observed Xu Que’s movements. It might look pathetic if he avoided the attacks, but it was better than getting hit. When Xu Que’s blade dissipated, Lin Yun’s eyes finally shined brightly. Then, he raised his right hand.

Looking at this scene, Xu Que squinted his eyes and crossed his arms, “Demon Light Dragon Armor!”

When Lin Yun’s punch landed on Xu Que’s arms, another explosion was heard. But after swallowing the Demon Bale Pellet, his armor was a lot stronger than before. He easily shook off Lin Yun’s attack.

After Xu Que was knocked backwards, Mo Yan and Liu Mu charged over. They threw punches that Lin Yun could barely react to. He was sent flying through the air as more shackles shot out.

It was a scene that left all the spectators surprised. Liu Mu and his group were clearly determined to kill Lin Yun in the Constellation Dragon Locking Array. With all the trump cards and the array, Lin yun probably wouldn’t survive.

With another earth-shattering sound, Liu mu’s demonic deity threw another punch at Lin Yun. Cracks could be heard as Lin Yun’s origin energy was compromised.

“Lin Yun, what other means do you have? Go ahead and bring them out!” Liu Mu laughed seeing that Lin Yun’s defense wouldn’t last long.

“Brother Liu, you think too highly of him. He would’ve used them if he had any trump cards,” sneered Xu Que.

Mo Yan’s eyes also flashed with violence as he spoke coldly, “Lin Yun, this is what you get for stealing my beast core! No matter how heaven-defying you are, there’s no way you can turn the tables around! This is the power of the higher realms!”

Lin Yun looked like he was in a desperate situation. At this moment, they couldn’t see the same arrogance that Lin Yun usually had.

“This is the confidence of the higher realms?” Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips with ridicule flashing through his pupils. “The confidence of the higher realms comes from being shameless? Do you pride yourselves in ganging up on people?”

“Cut the crap. We ganged up on you because we think highly of you,” Liu Mu grinned. As he thought about the suffering of the Bloodbone Realm, his eyes flashed coldly. He was finally getting revenge.

“Then I really have to thank you for thinking so highly of me,” said Lin Yun. “But it’s a pity that you’re about to be disappointed. I’ve been toying around with you because I wanted to test the Constellation Dragon Locking Array. Honestly, it’s not that impressive.”

When Lin Yun finished speaking, he smirked while his aura exploded. Instantly, Liu Mu, Mo Yan, and Xu Que became serious. They could tell that something wasn’t right.

Before they could figure out what was wrong, Lin Yun suddenly raised his right hand. A bright sun hovered in his palm as golden brilliance filled the entire crimson space. Then, Lin Yun barked, “It’s time to show you the true Divine Glorysun Fist.”

As the entire array started to tremble under the golden brilliance, Liu Mu panicked and yelled, “Mu Ziyi, quick! The array is going to break!”

Mu Ziyi had already discovered that there was something weird going on with the array. Beads of sweat covered his forehead as he quickly formed seals with his hands, “Constellation Shackles, Absolute Restriction!”

In that split second, the illusory shackles became more realistic as they shot towards Lin Yun from every single direction.

“Divine Sun Breaking Seal!” Lin Yun raised his right hand as dazzling brilliance shined from his palm. A winged human also appeared behind him that was more refined than Liu Mu’s demonic deity. In that split second, the ten crimson stars hanging high in the sky shattered as all the shackles began to crumble.

Mu Ziyi threw up blood and nearly fainted. At the same time, Liu Mu, Mo Yan, and Xu Que’s origin energy started to crack.

“How is this possible?!” The three were shocked because they never expected Lin Yun’s advanced fortune martial technique would become so powerful after two days. Its radiance alone was enough to render them helpless.

“It’s a monarch fortune martial technique!” Xu Que exclaimed.

“Run!” Liu Mu turned around and ran for his life.

“You think you can escape?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as his hair fluttered in the wind. Then, Lin Yun threw a punch and barked, “Radiance of the Sun, Eternal Glory!”

At this moment, Liu Mu, Mo Yan, Xu Que, and Mu Ziyi, who nearly fainted, were terrified to discover that their surroundings were restricted by the golden radiance coming from Lin Yun.

As the winged human unfolded its wings, Liu Mu, Mo Yan, Xu Que, and Mu Ziyi were gathered together. With a single punch, all four were constantly torn into pieces. At this moment, not a single corpse was left behind.
