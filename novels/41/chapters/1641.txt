Chapter 1642 - I Want Both!

Choose between the Blue Dragon or Azure Dragon inheritance? Lin Yun was briefly stunned because he didn’t know which to choose, and it would be best if Lil’ Purple was there right now. A brief moment later, he asked, “Big Brother, can I have both of them?”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Azure Dragon Lord threw out a mouthful of wine and smiled, “You’re really greedy. Can you even keep up with your cultivation?”

“I don’t know which to choose right now. I possess the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, and my dragon runes can condense into an Azure Dragon. But I also have the Blue Dragon Bone, and I feel like I’ll take a loss if I pick either of them. Or do you have any suggestions for me?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Are you willing to cultivate the Azure Dragon Sovereign Constellation?” The Azure Dragon Lord asked.

“Uhhh… I already have my own constellation named Heaven Burial. It’s also a sovereign constellation.” Lin Yun replied.

“A sovereign constellation? That is impossible…” The Azure Dragon Lord was stumped upon hearing that.

Lin Yun didn’t reply, but placed the Flower Burial Sword to the side before he started summoning his constellations. When a painting flew out of his body, there was a poem on it, “The phantom of the Flying Serpent bewitches all, disrupting both the circulation of stars and directions.”

“The Ancient Flying Serpent!” The Azure Dragon Lord said. He naturally recognized this ominous beast. Then again, this ominous beast might be powerful, but it wasn’t a sovereign constellation.

When another painting flew out from Lin Yun’s body, the Azure Dragon Lord squinted his eyes. “With a pair of eyes like the sun and moon, freezing all of eternity with one thought. This is the Ancient Aurora Dragon!”

“Looking back in the nine nethers, not even deities and gods would dare to look directly.”

Another painting flew out from Lin Yun, leaving the Azure Dragon Lord completely dumbfounded. This was the Ancient Demonic Phoenix.

“Kunpeng rises with the wind like the sun, soaring straight to the nine heavens.”

“Slicing through the primeval chaos on the summit of Kunlun, unleashing great prowess as the sun rises.” It didn’t take long for five paintings to appear behind Lin Yun, and each of them was an ominous beast. This also made Lin Yun’s forehead covered with sweat because he had reached his limit and could only summon five of them at his current cultivation.

It was still challenging for him to summon all nine to form the sovereign constellation. After he formed a seal, he said, “Come back!”

When all the paintings flew back into him, he looked at Jiang Ling and said, “This constellation is called Heaven Burial. There are nine paintings, but I can only summon five with my current strength.”

The Azure Dragon Lord was stunned for a long time before he smiled upon coming back to his senses, “Looks like I’m right about you. You don’t have to dwell on it and go with the Blue Dragon inheritance. This is because it’s unimportant to you, as I have discovered that you have your own path.”

After all, why would someone who could create a Sovereign Constellation follow the path of predecessors? In the end, Lin Yun would make them into his and create his own path.

“I’ll go with the Blue Dragon inheritance, then.” Lin Yun said.

“Alright, I’ll first grant you a droplet of the Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood!” A golden blood droplet appeared in the Azure Dragon Lord’s palm. Pushing it forth, the droplet of blood entered Lin Yun’s heart. When the blood entered his body, Lin Yun could sense a fire blazing within his heart, making his blood boil. He was entirely enveloped in a blue light; even his eyes and hair had turned blue with a faint dragon aura emitting from him.

“I’ll teach you the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art to refine the blood.”

When Lin Yun sat down, a technique appeared within his mind. While his dragon origin followed the instructions and circulated within his body, Lin Yun didn’t even have to circulate it by himself because it was done under the guidance of the Azure Dragon Lord.

“Focus on refining the blood. As for the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art, use it to merge with your Azure Dragon Saint Physique and let it take a step further. This droplet of blood can aid you in transforming your saint physique. Your saint physique was restrained in the past because it hadn’t awakened yet. Today I’ll give it all to you.” As Lin Yun refined the blood, the Azure Dragon Lord tapped on Lin Yun’s forehead, directly pouring martial comprehension into Lin Yun’s mind. This was more important than any inheritance that could benefit Lin Yun for life. There were many comprehensions in it that could allow Lin Yun’s eyesight to become comparable to saints.

“To other cultivators, they might be unable to awaken their saint physique even with the dragon blood. But you’re not the same because you have the Divine Dragon Bone, and your Azure Dragon Saint Art has reached complete mastery. So awakening your saint physique is a lot easier…” The Azure Dragon Lord’s voice echoed within Lin Yun’s ears.

“Lin Yun, you have your own path in the future, and inheritances are nothing to you. So don’t dwell on them too much. I’ve seen many people over the years, and my lineage has a long inheritance. So I don’t have much for you…” The Azure Dragon Lord said, and Lin Yun could sense the sorrow in his tone.

As the blue dragon's blood fused with Lin Yun’s heart, a boundless energy flowed throughout his body to his cells. Under the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art, his physique was like an iron being refined.

Four hours later, Lin Yun opened his eyes, and noticed that his Azure Dragon Saint Physique had been awakened. He could sense that the dragon runes on his body became more spiritual. Each dragon rune was stained with a crimson line that made the runes look as though they were alive.

“How do you feel?” The Azure Dragon Lord asked.

“The changes don’t seem great.” Lin Yun examined his body and noticed that aside from the increment in the number of dragon runes, the changes to his physique didn’t seem to be that great.

“Is that so?” The Azure Dragon Lord smiled. “Put your hand out.”

When Lin Yun placed his hand out, the Azure Dragon Lord swiftly swiped his palm, wounding it. But that wound on his palm healed instantly, which gave him a misperception.

“This…?”

“The Blue Dragon is of the wood attribute, which means vitality. This is only the tip of the iceberg. Although it won’t reach the extent of growing an entire arm back, the profundity isn’t something you can imagine.” The Azure Dragon Lord said. He suddenly grabbed Lin Yun’s hand and ripped his arm off.

Lin Yun was dumbfounded, and the intense pain made his mind blank. But Jiang Ling didn’t say a word and placed Lin Yun’s arm back on his shoulder. Then, a bizarre scene occurred. His arm and shoulder connected with the wound completely healed. Lin Yun tried to wave his arm around, but he couldn’t feel anything wrong with it. It was as though it hadn’t been ripped off in the first place.

“This… How is this possible?” Lin Yun was stumped.

“The Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood is profound, but you don’t have to be shocked about it. The Blue Dragon wields the wood attribute; the Azure Dragon wields thunderstorm; the Golden Dragon wields slaughter; the Indigo Dragon wields thunder, and so on. Every Divine Dragon has a different attribute.”

“Is that so? Then it’s pretty impressive.” Lin Yun replied with a smile.

“Of course, it’s impressive.” Jiang Ling smiled. “Think about the Dragon Pulse Realm’s tribulations. Each tribulation is a life-death experience, especially for you. You’ll die in your tribulation sooner or later without a special opportunity. But with the regenerative ability of the Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood, your future tribulations will be easier.”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up. He had to admit that his previous tribulations were dangerous. But now he didn’t have to be so afraid because of the Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood. He had already obtained enough foundation in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. If he didn’t have to worry about his tribulation, he could reach the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm anytime he wanted.

“Try circulating the Azure Dragon Saint Art now.” Jiang Ling said, looking at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun had no idea what Jiang Ling meant, but he still did as he was told. Circulating the Azure Dragon Saint Art, dragon runes appeared on the surface of his body. The next second, powerful thunderstorm energy enveloped his body, covering him in a cyclone with lightning crackling.

When Lin Yun reached out, the wind and lightning were within his hand’s grasp, and his fist emitted a terrifying power. He could clearly guess that his grasp immediately extracted all the thunderstorms within this region.

“Thunderstorm control?” Lin Yun muttered while letting go of the thunderstorm in his hand.

“Your Azure Dragon Saint Physique has awakened. After your Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art reaches complete mastery, your saint physique will evolve into the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.” The Azure Dragon Lord sighed. “I’ve seen many people over the past hundred years, but I’ve given almost everything I have. I only have this droplet of Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood left.”

“So… I can be considered to possess the Blue Dragon and Azure Dragon’s inheritances?” Lin Yun asked.

Nodding his head, the Azure Dragon Lord said with a gentle smile, “Didn’t you say that you wanted both?”

Only a child would make a choice. As an adult, he naturally wanted both. But he initially didn’t hold much hope in it because he felt he was too greedy.

“The Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art is complicated, and you have to comprehend it well. I have left everything in your mind, but don’t be in a hurry to look over them. I have cleared your meridians with the Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood, and you have reached the first stage in the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art.” Before he looked at Lin Yun, Jiang Ling explained, “I can sense that you possess a treasure of the Azure Dragon’s lineage. Take it out, and let me see it.”

Nodding his head, Lin Yun took out the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

“This…” The Azure Dragon Lord was dazed while looking at the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. He said, “This is the sovereign saint artifact of my clan. Where did you find it? I couldn’t find it anywhere.”

Lin Yun then told Jiang Ling his experience in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm and how he entered the White Dragon Divine Palace.

“Hahaha! This is fate!” The Azure Dragon Lord laughed. “There are still two restrictions on it. Let me undo them for you, hahaha!”

Jiang Ling couldn’t help laughing when he heard that. Patting Lin Yun’s shoulder excitedly, he smiled, “You’re really lucky. With this, you can wield the Sovereign Constellation even without cultivating your constellation again. This is great!”

The Azure Dragon Lord was excited when he held onto the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.
