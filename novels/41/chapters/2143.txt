Chapter 2144: Make Trouble! (2)

So what if the True Dragon Path was insignificant to the other dragon paths? Even a variant dragon had its dignity, and no one was born trash, not to mention this was called the True Dragon Path, not garbage dragon.

So who wouldn’t have any temper? Seeing Mu Qianjue repelled back and throwing out blood, all the geniuses on the True Dragon Path vented their emotions as they yelled, “Mu Qianjue, get lost from the True Dragon Path!”

“Mu Qianjue, get lost from the True Dragon Path!”

“Mu Qianjue, get lost from the True Dragon Path!” Everyone roared loudly to express their emotions, and their voices were so loud that they could even be heard from outside the Dragon Mountains.

“Oh my god, the tables turned around?”

“Isn’t Mu Qianjue a little too pathetic? Even the geniuses on the True Dragon Path are all looking down on him.”

“I wouldn’t be happy either if I was in their position. He’s clearly a loser and Cao Yang already gave him enough face. But he still wanted to humiliate Cao Yang by breaking an arm. Who the hell does he think he is?”

“That’s right. So what if he’s the champion of a Heavenly Path? The myths should have been shattered a long time ago.” Many people were discussing amongst themselves. But not many people stood on Mu Qianjue’s side, and even some who didn’t like Ye Qingtian didn’t dare to express their opposition.

Seeing this scene, the few on the Dragon’s Head of the Indigo Dragon Path were also surprised. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Lady An, please go on and take your seat on the Indigo Dragon Path’s throne,” Drifting Goblet smiled politely at An Liuyan.

“What?” An Liuyan was nervous and had no idea what was going on. After all, she wasn’t familiar with Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan. She guessed that it must have something to do with Lin Yun, but that didn’t seem to be the case.

“Lady An, don’t worry about it. We’re under the orders of the Ninth Princess to let you take a seat on the throne,” Bai Lixuan added politely.

Drifting Goblet smiled, “It’s fine. Even if there’s something, it has nothing to do with you but Ye Qingtian. After all, he had publicly declared that you’re his woman. So why don’t you dare sit on it when he wants to get a spot for you?”

Hearing the Ninth Princess, An Liuyan couldn’t help becoming nervous. She said, “N-No. I’m not.”

“It’s fine, nothing will happen. Even if something will happen, your young master will bear the responsibility. So what is there to be afraid of?” Drifting Goblet smiled.

An Liuyan was frightened and helpless as she sat on the Indigo Dragon Path’s throne. As for Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan, they were like her guards as they stood beside her, not allowing anyone to get close.

Back on the True Dragon Path, the battle was still ongoing between Lin Yun and Mu Qianjue. The latter couldn’t repel Lin Yun no matter how he tried and the black and white world was constantly being destroyed. As Mu Qianjue threw another mouthful of blood, his face became much paler than before.

“Mu Qianjue, get lost from the True Dragon Path!” Mu Qianjue had long heard the voices of everyone on the True Dragon Path, but he didn’t pay any attention to them. Just a gaze from him was normally enough to intimidate everyone to shut their mouths. But his face was ugly, feeling aggrieved deep in his heart.

He was the champion of a Heavenly Path, so when had he been so humiliated before?

“Haha, what a joke. A bunch of garbage on the variant dragon dares to call out to me?” Mu Qianjue said in a self-mocking tone.

“Even the lowest existence has a chance to compete with the strongest. The legendary Heavenly Dragon comes from the variant dragons. We can be arrogant, but we can’t bully the weak since there’s no need for that,” Lin Yun said.

Mu Qianjue’s face changed, and he said coldly, “An ant is an ant. No need to say any further. Let me ask you one question. Why are you targeting me?”

“So you’re telling me that the champions of the Heavenly Paths aren’t a bunch of ants who killed their way out? Furthermore, I don’t have the luxury of time to play with you. But if you want to come to the True Dragon Path and sit on the throne here, I won’t agree to it,” Lin Yun refuted.

“I’ll give you this face, then!” Mu Qianjue coldly said before the black and white wings behind him flapped. He soared to the sky and wanted to leave the True Dragon Path. He had a strong stance and was arrogant, but he didn’t admit defeat. His eyes were filled with reluctance as he hovered in the air, coldly looking at Lin Yun.

Mu Qianjue clenched his right fist together with hatred filling his heart. He was determined to repay the humiliation he suffered together.

“Ha.” Lin Yun merely laughed it off, not caring much about it. He spread his arms apart, then descended before Cao Yang, and asked, “Are you alright?”

He was the one who put Cao Yang on the throne, and Lin Yun would definitely feel bad about it if something happened to him.

“It’s fine. He’s just a loser, and there’s nothing he can do to me. I just didn’t bring out my Vajra Golden Physique and suffered his sneak attack,” Cao Yang casually replied.

“The Vajra Golden Physique?” Lin Yun asked with a playful smile.

“That’s for sure,” Cao Yang said proudly.

“It’s good that you’re fine. You’re more suitable on the throne,” Lin Yun smiled.

Cao Yang was startled when he heard that, and he said, “No, no, no. I can’t do it. Lady Ye can have it instead, and I believe no one will say a word about it.”

Ye Ziling was stunned upon hearing her name called out.

“That’s right. Young Master Ye, let Lady Ye have the throne instead. She’s the daughter of Jian Jingtian, possessing the Divine Dragon Sword Physique. Her potential is limitless, so she’s perfect to be on the throne.”

“That’s right. If anyone dares to fight for it, we’ll fight against them together!” The other geniuses on the True Dragon Path joined in after hearing what Cao Yang said.

Seeing this, Lin Yun was surprised and speechless. He could tell that these people were sincere with their words. This was because Ye Qingtian was strong and was worthy of their respect. Most importantly, what Ye Qingtian said earlier had struck their hearts when he said that even the champions of the Heavenly Paths used to be a bunch of ants who killed their way out, then how he said that even the lowest existence possessed the qualifications to compete with the strongest. That was how the Divine Dragon Era should be, not seeking immortality but pursuing one’s dreams.

This was why everyone was respectful towards Lin Yun.

“See what I said? Lady Ye, please don’t refuse it. I won’t sit on the throne again even if you kill me,” Cao Yang smiled.

Ye Ziling bitterly smiled when she heard that, before she turned to look at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was also feeling rather helpless, but that seemed like a pretty good idea after he thought about it.

“Mhm? That fellow seemed to have gone to the Azure Dragon Path,” Cao Yang suddenly spoke out.

When Lin Yun turned his head over, he saw Mu Qianjue breaking through the Azure Dragon Path’s barrier and heading towards the Dragon’s Head. This instantly made his face change, and he roared, “Why the hell?does that bastard always have to make trouble with me?!”
