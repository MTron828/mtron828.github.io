Chapter 1977 - Secluded Cultivation

Wang Yue left in satisfaction, leaving behind the dumbfounded Lin Yun.

“Haha! It looks like the misunderstanding is a little deep this time,” Lil’ Purple gloated from the Iris Secret Realm.

“Yeah. The misunderstanding is too deep,” Lin Yun smiled wryly.

“What do you plan to do now? Are you going over there half a month from now? I can make preparations for you in advance,” Lil’ Purple said excitedly.

“Why should I? What does it have to do with me?” Lin Yun rejected her proposal. He was already misunderstood, and he didn’t want the misunderstanding to grow deeper. He had no choice but to accept the karma Ye Qingtian left behind to protect his identity, and he did absurd things that he normally wouldn’t do.

Looking back at it now, his actions did look like he was infatuated in the eyes of some. So it was no wonder that Wang Yue would misunderstand him, which wasn’t surprising.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He did all of that to ensure that his identity would not be exposed, but he didn’t know that it gave Bai Shuying some trouble. In addition to what happened within the Celestial Pool, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling guilty towards her. He agreed with Bai Shuying that he would come to the Heavenly Dao Sect to look for her one day, and it wouldn’t seem good if he went against their promise.

“Scumbag,” Lil’ Purple said in contempt.

“I can’t get involved in this matter anymore. I’m here in the Heavenly Dao Sect to become stronger. I must still return to the Ancient Barren Domain to protect my master during his breakthrough!” Lin Yun’s gaze became determined. He couldn’t be involved with Ye Qingtian’s karma anymore because his master would break into the Emperor Realm sooner or later, and Tian Xuanzi would make a move then.

Lin Yun swept his gaze and stopped on the stone tablet before inwardly sighing. Since he was here, he might as well take advantage of this opportunity to cultivate.

He carried the sword box and returned to the cave. He got Lil’ Purple to set up a few spiritual arrays before taking out the Three-Lives Fruit. But when he took it out, he noticed a crack on the Three-Lives Fruit with several small cracks extending from that. He exclaimed, “What’s going on?”

“Why are you surprised? The Three-Lives Fruit is a one-time usage item, and you’ve separated your usage multiple times.” Lil’ Purple came over and said, “Bring it over. Let me take a look at it.”

“How many times can I use it?”

“About two times for two years each,” Lil’ Purple said as she handed the fruit to Lin Yun. “This Three-Lives Fruit is of the best quality; otherwise, the effects would have become worse.”

“I have to cherish it well, then,” Lin Yun said as he tightly held the Three-Lives Fruit. Aside from the Heavenly Dao Sect's resources, the Three-Lives Fruit was the main reason he could become so strong at such a fast speed.

“But you have almost finished using all your resources. Are you sure that you want to use the Three-Lives Fruit?” Lil’ Purple asked. Lin Yun would waste his time within the Three-Lives Realm without resources.

“I can still use the Great Saint Origin twice,” Lin Yun said. “So I’ll use it once.”

There were already rumors that he refined a saint origin, and Lin Yun had nearly forgotten that he had an actual saint origin. That was the Great Saint Origin left behind by the Profound Wither Great Saint, the disciple of the Southern Emperor!

“Are you really not going?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“No.” Lin Yun gritted his teeth and entered the Three-Lives Realm. A year should be enough for him to refine the Great Saint Origin. The Great Saint Origin left behind by the Profound Wither Great Saint was sealed nine times, and its energy would multiply as he unlocked it.

The energy of the eighth seal was more than all the previous seven times. As for the ninth time, it was certain that it should be stronger than the first to eight seals combined.

Lin Yun sat with his legs crossed and took out the Saint Dragon Pellet, before immediately swallowing it. The Saint Dragon Pellet quickly dissolved into boundless vitality within his body. When this energy peaked, a mighty dragon origin gathered within his chest, and Lin Yun roared.

Along with a dragon roar, Lin Yun endured the pain as a pair of golden wings appeared behind him. Under the stimulation of the dragon origin, the Saint Dragon Pellet began to thoroughly fuse with his body. Saint runes were appearing on the golden wings, before they began to devour the surrounding spiritual energy.

0This Saint Dragon Pellet actually made the Golden Crow Wings merge with me even more perfectly! Lin Yun was inwardly surprised. The Divine Sunchasing Art was actually cultivating this pair of wings. The wings could not only increase his speed, but it was also a myriad-rune saint artifact. At the end of the cultivation, he could even engrave glory spirits on it.

The Golden Crow Wings had over twenty thousand saint runes, and he even fused it with many golden crow feathers. So the wings were as sharp as a saint artifact.

Relying on this Saint Dragon Pellet, the Golden Crow Wings could actually help him cultivate by devouring the spiritual energy between heaven and earth just like the ancient Golden Crows. Lin Yun could cultivate with his techniques and the Golden Crow Wings. This meant his cultivation could achieve twice the effect, and the Saint Dragon Pellet had given him a surprise.

“Time to unseal the Great Saint Origin!” Lin Yun formed a seal, and the Profound Wither Key within his heart began to release boundless energy. As boundless energy poured out from the key, it poured out of his pores and covered every corner of the Three-Lives Realm. The density of energy within the surroundings reached a shocking height.

Fortunately, I’m within the Three-Lives Realm, or so much of the saint aura would be lost in the outside world. Lin Yun inwardly muttered. This reminded him that he had to set up a spiritual array when he wanted to undo the last seal.

Just like that, Lin Yun spent three months within the Three-Lives Realm. He could have made a breakthrough long ago by relying on the energy he refined, but Lin Yun didn’t do that and continued to refine more of the energy to purify it even further.

He had ten dragon pulses as his foundation, which far exceeded others. He could fight enemies at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage when he was only at the first. In a sense, the higher the purity of the nirvana aura, the harder it would be for him to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm. But that was relatively speaking because he would also become stronger than others when he made a breakthrough.

After six months of seclusion, Lin Yun finally attempted to make a breakthrough. His breakthrough was smooth, and he had condensed a core within his violet palace. The core was condensed with nirvana aura after purifying it multiple times. The nirvana aura that was initially chaotic had been regulated into streams of energy around the core.

There were ten thousand strands of nirvana aura, and they coiled around the core. They were like swirling stars, and this was no longer in the scope of the mortal realm. After all, the Nirvana Stage was a transformation into the saint path, and one would shred their mortality the further they went in the transformation.

Time passed quickly, and Lin Yun stayed within the Three-Lives Realm for a year. His cultivation reached the second transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and he also formed the second core with twenty thousand strands of nirvana aura coiling around it. The two cores looked like two astral vortexes within his violent palace.

Back at Remorse Cliff, Bai Xiao stood on the stone tablet, looking bored as he occasionally glanced in the direction of the cave. He sighed, “Ye Qingtian can really hold himself in to stay within the cave for seven days straight.”

He initially thought he could kill his time by chatting with Ye Qingtian, but he never expected that Ye Qingtian would disappear into the cave. This was harsh on him because no one knew when the Dragon Origin Great Saint would return.

Within the Three-Lives Realm, Lin Yun opened his eyes and stopped his cultivation. The Three-Lives Realm still had a lot of energy and would be a massive resource if he could devour all of it. He was already in the Three-Lives Realm for nearly two years, reaching the pinnacle third transformation of the Nirvana Stage. His nirvana aura also reached seventy thousand strands, which was a tremendous boost to his strength.

“It’s still insufficient for me to reach the fourth transformation by relying on external items. I need real training.” Lin Yun had a clear understanding within his heart. He already tried to make a breakthrough multiple times in two years, but he couldn’t congeal the fourth core, no matter how he tried.

The Nirvana Stage had nine transformations; the first four weren’t tough. The real challenge was after the fifth transformation, especially the seventh, eighth, and ninth transformations. Each breakthrough was a tremendous boost in strength.

The closer he was to the saint path, the clearer he could sense its power. Lin Yun knew that he couldn’t make a breakthrough; not because he lacked the resources,0 but because he lacked life-and-death experiences. So he gave up and focused on consolidating his cultivation. After all, it wasn’t good to be hasty in cultivation.

When he left the cave, Lin Yun saw Bai Xiao meditating. He had a purple saint aura coiling around him, and he could faintly see the outline of a dragon. Bai Xiao was also basking in saint radiance and seemed to have transcended from this world.

Lin Yun squinted his pupils and could feel the threat coming from Bai Xiao. If Bai Xiao was willing, he could sever a mountain. To a certain degree, those at the Quasi-Saint Realm were already on the saint path because their strength had far surpassed the mortal realm.

The Quasi-Saint Realm has nine stages and only three phases in general. They’re the Azure Origin Phase, Indigo Origin Phase, and the Heavenly Origin Phase.

“You’re finally willing to come out?” Bai Xiao opened his eyes with a smile and recalled the surrounding purple saint aura into his body. But he was soon surprised when he looked at Ye Qingtian because he could sense that the latter’s cultivation had become stronger. His nirvana aura became more refined, and this made Bai Xiao wonder if Ye Qingtian really had a saint origin.

“I didn’t expect Brother Bai to be at the Indigo Origin Phase. I have been disrespectful in the past,” Lin Yun smiled as he stepped forth. He initially thought that Bai Xiao had just reached the Quasi-Saint Realm and that he would only be at the Azure Origin Phase. But he never expected Bai Xiao to be at the Indigo Origin Phase.

“I can’t be compared to you,” Bai Xiao smiled.

“Big Brother Bai, you’re too humble. With your age, it’s only a matter of time for you to reach the Heavenly Origin Phase and ignite the sacred flame.” Lin Yun could tell that Bai Xiao wasn’t simple.

“You don’t have to flatter me. I could be considered a genius in the past, but I have already excavated all my potential at my age, not to mention the Golden Era is coming. So it’s nothing impressive, even if I became a Saint,” Bai Xiao smiled.

Lin Yun could naturally notice Bai Xiao’s disappointment in himself, and he changed the topic, “How long have I been in the cave?”

“Thirteen days,” Bai Xiao replied.

Lin Yun briefly pondered and couldn’t help asking, “Has the Divine Dao Pavilion’s party arrived?”

“Are you talking about Young Master Wushuang? Don’t tell me that you’re really going after my clan’s holy maiden, are you?” Bai Xiao raised his brow and asked with a playful smile.
