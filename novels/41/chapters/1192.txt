Chapter 1193 - Ants Beneath the Fleeting Clouds

Unlike the others, Gongsun Yan had seen how extraordinary Lin Yun was at the first glance. When he first received news of Lin Yun reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, he felt just as doubtful as everyone else. After all, it was too hard to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm.

In fact, he tried reaching the limit as well. Back then, he had reached his limit when he achieved six Demonic Astral Flowers in reach of his aura oceans. So he wanted to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, but he gave up after watching a senior brother fail and die. It took him a long time for him to recover from that blow.

“Perhaps I might be able to make a breakthrough in my sword by fighting him. I might even be able to plant a sword cocoon in the center of my brows.” Gongsun Yan muttered to himself. He didn’t reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, but there was no question that he could dissolve the knot in his heart if he could defeat a genius like Lin Yun.

Gongsun Yan was already at the quasi-Elysium Core Realm. He could easily suppress experts in the lesser Elysium Core Realm. Even if he suppressed his cultivation of the Heavenly Soul Realm, the quality of his origin energy wouldn’t be any inferior compared to Lin Yun. So this was a rare opportunity for him.

Meanwhile, Feng Xingyang was on the verge of losing. Although Lin Yun still hadn’t attacked, the immense sword aura made Feng Xingyang feel like he was stuck in an ocean. The difference between Feng Xingyang and Lin Yun was too great, which was very clear in Gongsun Yan’s eyes.

Unless Feng Xingyang removed the restriction on his cultivation, there was no way he could defeat Lin Yun. But this advantage would disappear as soon as Lin Yun reached the Empyrean Realm. Even Gongsun Yan couldn’t imagine how powerful Lin Yun would become after reaching the Empyrean Realm.

At this moment, Gongsun Yan knew that he made the right choice coming to the Sword Assembly. Lin Yun was crucial to helping him reach the next step. In his eyes, Lin Yun was the perfect stepping stone.

Just when Feng Xingyang couldn’t bear it anymore, he let out a ferocious roar and brought out his holy spirit martial technique. It was his trump card. However, he would be defeated if he couldn’t force Lin Yun to attack.

Just when everyone was feeling nervous, Gongsun Yan shook his head because Feng Xingyang was doomed. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his sky sword intent at complete mastery exploded out with his hair fluttering wildly.

In a split second, Feng Xingyang’s sword intent crumbled. This was the huge gulf between complete mastery and greater mastery. His sword intent was like a powerful sword slicing through butter.

Feng Xingyang threw up a mouthful of blood. He didn’t even have the chance to execute his holy spirit martial technique as Lin Yun’s sword ray easily crushed the origin energy around him. Under the immense sword aura, Feng Xingyang threw up another mouthful of blood as his face turned red and he fell to his knees. Meanwhile, cracks started to spread out on the ominous beast statues.

No one could imagine the pressure that Feng Xingyang was feeling right now. After all, it was so strong that the statues were cracking. At this moment, Feng Xingyang’s eyes were filled with fear as he looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun only needed one move to defeat him, but he chose the easiest method to make him dance around on the stage like a clown.

“I lost…” Feng Xingyang bit his lips. At this moment, he was really afraid that Lin Yun would force him to sever an arm. At this moment, no one dared to look down on Lin Yun.

On the other hand, Ye Feifan’s smile grew denser because he knew that Lin Yun did this on purpose. Lin Yun gave Zhao Yan face while he humiliated Feng Xingyang thoroughly. Lin Yun even allowed Zhao Yan to leave with a few praises while he let Feng Xingyang experience humiliation. It looked like Lin Yun’s temper had a limit and Feng Xingyang took things too far.

Feng Xiaoyu was completely dumbfounded on the stage as if she had taken a slap from Lin Yun. As for the crowd, they were silently waiting for things to play out.

“It’s time to fulfill your promise,” said Lin Yun. His words instantly caused an uproar because Feng Xingyang was someone from the Feng Clan.

“I…” Feng Xingyang’s face turned red because he never thought that he would fail.

“How does it feel?” Lin Yun continued. “You probably didn’t consider how I felt when you didn't allow me to leave earlier. The princess of your clan has accused me time and time again, and none of you considered how I felt. Even your guards mocked me when I entered this place.”

Feng Xingyang lowered his face in shame. He didn’t have the courage to sever his arm nor could he refute Lin Yun’s words.

“Do you now know the difference between you and Zhao Yan?” Lin Yun asked. “If Zhao Yan were in your position, he would sever his arm before I even asked. This is why you’re weaker than him.”

“I’ll… sever it.” Feng Xingyang was left speechless by Lin Yun’s words. Although he said that he would sever his arm, he still couldn’t make a move.

“Why don’t you give me face and let this matter pass? The Feng Clan will give you ten saint swords as promised, and I will also owe you a favor. In the future, if you want to forge a sword, I will do my best to fulfill your demand.” Feng Xuanzi sighed from the platform as he looked at Lin Yun.

This scene caused an uproar because Feng Xuanzi actually said that he would owe Lin Yun. Among the crowd, Bai Ting who was beside Luo Hua, also kept giving Lin Yun an eye signal.

Lin Yun knew that Bai Ting didn’t want the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect to become enemies with the Hidden Sword Pavilion. So nodding his head, Lin Yun glanced at Feng Xingyang and said, “Get lost.”

Feng Xingyang felt heavily relieved and fled, not even daring to look back. Then, someone delivered ten saint swords to Lin Yun, which he stored in his interspatial pouch. After coming this far, Lin Yun knew that he couldn’t leave the Sword Assembly anymore. If he left now, Bai Ting and the other geniuses wouldn’t agree.

“Anyone else?” Lin Yun swept his glance around while holding onto the Flower Burial Sword. But all the geniuses he looked at lowered their heads and didn’t dare to look at him.

At this moment, Feng Xiaoyu had finally panicked. No one was standing up for her to face Lin Yun. No one dared to look at him, which meant that she had lost.

“Me!” Gongsun Yan stood up just when things got too quiet. When he was done, Gongsun Yan released his sky sword intent at complete mastery and a powerful sword aura soared into the sky. When he swept his glance around, all the geniuses around him felt a heavy weight on their shoulders. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“All of you are ants beneath the fleeting clouds!” Gongsun Yan said something that the majority of the geniuses couldn’t understand. When he was done, he soared onto the stage with an invincible gale enveloping him as the layer of heavens began to shatter. He was like a perfect sword in the world at this moment.

Seeing the gale around Gongsun Yan, someone exclaimed, “The gale seems like the phenomenon of the Void Shattering Sword Art!”

The Void Shattering Sword Art was the holy spirit sword technique that the Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng, created when he was young. After becoming an emperor, he perfected this sword art that became famous in Kunlun Realm.

“Gongsun Yan’s sect has a connection with the Sword Emperor’s lineage, so it’s not surprising that he cultivates the Void Shattering Sword Art.”

“I still thought that he had no interest in the Sword Assembly. If he didn’t make a move, Lin Yun would really sweep through the Sword Assembly!”

When Gongsun Yan landed on the stage, the gale around him formed into swords that dissolved in the atmosphere. There were nine swords, and Lin Yun had seen them clearly.

Gongsun Yan looked at Lin Yun and smiled, “I made a name for myself a long time ago, so I shouldn’t make a move against you. But this is the Sword Assembly and we have to restrict our cultivation to the Heavenly Soul Realm. Although I’m taking advantage of you, this is almost a fair fight.”

Lin Yun didn’t know of Gongsun Yan’s origin, but he could tell with a glance that Gongsun Yan was a lot stronger than the likes of Zhao Yan. He could sense a majestic aura emitting from Gongsun Yan that instantly enveloped the entire plaza.

“Unlike the others, I know about your origin. You’re a lot stronger than everyone here. I hope you’ll have a harvest in this battle,” said Gongsun Yan confidently.

Lin Yun had attracted the attention of some powerful forces when he reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. So Lin Yun knew that Gongsun Yan had to be prepared since he was confident in challenging Lin Yun.

Clearly, Gongsun Yan wanted to use Lin Yun as a stepping stone.
