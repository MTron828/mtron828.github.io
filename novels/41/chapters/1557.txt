Chapter 1558 - Saint Disciples Leaving The Saint Mountain

Lin Yun had a slightly unbelievable expression on his face as he looked at the Demonic Rune Tiger that was sent flying out. After all, the Demonic Rune Tiger was at least a monarch demonic beast.

So it was a little too unbelievable to be sent flying with a glance, even if he caught it by surprise. Was this the true power of the Divine Dragon Aura?

“How pitiful…” Lil Purple said.

“Uhh…” Lin Yun awkwardly scratched his head, as if he didn’t hear what Lil’ Purple said.

“This fist technique is incomplete.” Lin Yun said with a grave expression.

“Yeah, the crucial part is missing. There are only four forms, and the remaining forms are all missing.” Lil’ Purple said.

“This is a little difficult. Let me record everything first.” Lin Yun nodded. The four forms recorded on the stone monument were the Soaring Divine Dragon, Divine Dragon Order, Raging Divine Dragon, and Repentless Divine Dragon. Aside from that, there was also the Sovereign Dragon Seal.

The Sovereign Dragon Seal was the starting gesture and foundation of the Sovereign Dragon Fist. The Sovereign Dragon Fist was nothing without the Sovereign Dragon Seal. The Sovereign Dragon Seal was highly profound. The moment he succeeds in learning it, even if he didn’t execute the Sovereign Dragon Fist, he could unleash the power of the divine dragon with the Divine Solar Lunar Fist.

Then again, trying to form the Sovereign Dragon Seal was challenging. Even if the stone monument had the complete diagram, it wasn’t that easy, or he would’ve already succeeded. Placing Lil’ Purple to the side, Lin Yun stood before the stone monument and circulated the astral energy within his body, controlling it through his meridians, muscles, dragon runes, bloodline, and even his Firmament Sword Intent before gathering it in his arms.

Simultaneously, he circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art, Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, and the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. After gathering all of his power, his arms felt heavy, and he began to form a seal with his fingers. Whenever he formed a seal, his vitality would be exhausted and converted into a boundless dragon aura.

When he formed ten seals, his dragon aura multiplied tenfold, and his physique struggled to hold on. When he reached his limit, Lin Yun formed a profound seal with his hands, “Sovereign Dragon Seal!”

His pupils became golden, and an oppressive aura swept out with Lin Yun’s expression becoming grave. Looking at the Sovereign Dragon Seal, Lin Yun unhappily furrowed his brow. “I’m still a little lacking…”

As a dragon roar echoed from the stone monument, seven-colored lights shone from the monument. But he knew that he should be on the right path. As long as he carried on, he would definitely be able to form the Sovereign Dragon Seal.

Lin Yun spent the remaining time cultivating. On the first day, he tried three thousand times until he ran out of vitality and astral energy. Every time he exhausted his vitality and astral energy, he would consume fruits to replenish them before continuing to practice the Sovereign Dragon Seal.

On the second day, he tried thirteen thousand times, exhausting his vitality and astral energy four times. He also managed to condense two of the divine lights of the Sovereign Dragon Seal. On the third day, he tried twenty thousand times, exhausting his vitality and astral energy six times, condensing three divine lights.

It wasn’t easy because he would be in great pain every time he was done. He wanted to stop and rest well, but he knew he would fail if he rested. So he would grit his teeth and persevere. The Sovereign Dragon Seal finally gathered all seven divine lights on the ninth day.

“Sovereign Dragon Seal!” Lin Yun soared into the sky as seven divine lights radiated from his hands. His dragon aura also broke through the limits of Elysium Core Realm. Judging from his aura, it exceeded those at the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

Empowered by the Sovereign Dragon Seal, Lin Yun executed the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. Three punches later, the sky became pale, and the power of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist was three times what it was before. It had broken through the bottleneck of a holy spirit martial technique.

“It’s already so powerful when I’ve just entered the threshold of the Sovereign Dragon Seal. If I master the first form, how powerful will it become?” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered. Over the past new days, he didn’t just reach the threshold in the Sovereign Dragon Seal but also excavated all the potential of the Blue Dragon Bone.

Next, he would start practicing the first form of the Sovereign Dragon Fist—Soaring Divine Dragon. After spending another month, Lin Yun successfully mastered the Soaring Divine Dragon. Empowered by the Sovereign Dragon Fist, he would unleash a divine dragon when he threw his punch.

Soaring to the sky, Lin Yun executed the Sovereign Dragon Seal and a hundred divine dragons flew out from his body. When every divine dragon flew to the sky, they fused with the sky as Lin Yun threw his punch out.

Ten miles away, a mountain of a few thousand feet was reduced to ashes by his punch. This made Lin Yun inwardly rejoice because he had finally mastered the first form, even if he had just entered the threshold. He could unleash a thousand dragons after reaching lesser mastery, and it would only become more powerful once he masters the other forms.

“I should have the strength to become first on the Elysium Core Ranking, right?” If it was in the past, he would definitely feel that he was already first on the Elysium Core Ranking. But after fighting Bai Liuying, Lin Yun sensed that the weight of the Elysium Core Ranking was more significant than he had imagined. After all, that was a ranking containing every expert in the Eastern Desolation, not only the Ancient Barren Domain. As a genius of a holy land, Bai Liuying had shown him the power of a holy land’s genius.

“It shouldn’t be an issue to reach the top ten.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with confidence as he unleashed an aura belonging to a nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. During this cultivation period, he consumed various vitality-replenishing fruits to excavate the potential of the Blue Dragon Bone.

Lin Yun was already at the pinnacle of the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. He could already make a breakthrough when refining the Netherflower, but he suppressed it to ensure a firm foundation. Now that he had practically reached the limit before making a breakthrough, he was confident of reaching the peak.

He didn’t fight with those in the top ten, so he wasn’t too confident about it. Anyhow, he wasn’t afraid of anyone in the Elysium Core Realm. Even if he had to face geniuses from holy lands, Lin Yun wouldn’t be scared.

Knowing it was time for him to return, Lin Yun memorized the diagrams on the stone monument before returning to the Sword Sect.

“Lord Lin, you’re returning?” The Demonic Rune Tiger ran over, inwardly rejoicing.

Looking at the Demonic Rune Tiger, Lin Yun briefly pondered before he said, “Hand me your saint blade.”

The Demonic Rune Tiger became nervous upon hearing that and asked, “Lord Lin, I spent a great deal of effort to obtain that saint blade.”

“What are you thinking about?” Lin Yun asked curiously. “I’m leaving. So I want to perform your blade technique for you. It shouldn’t be an issue for you to deal with demonic beasts with your blade technique, but it’s filled with flaws in the eyes of an expert.”

The Demonic Rune Tiger became emotional when he heard that. After all, he knew how strong Lin Yun was, and it was his most significant opportunity that Lin Yun was willing to teach him. He was already stuck in his blade technique and knew it was only possible to make a breakthrough if he had someone to teach him. If he relied on himself, he could only reach greater mastery.

“Observe well.” Lin Yun held onto the blade and performed the blade technique once, and it already showed signs of reaching complete mastery. This holy spirit martial technique ultimately reached the manifestation stage, leaving the Demonic Rune Tiger stumped.

“Alright, I’ll be leaving.” Lin Yun smiled. He might not be proficient in blade techniques, but it was only a holy spirit martial technique. So it was not difficult for him.

When he returned to the Sword Sect, he instantly fell asleep.

Seven days later, Mu Qingqing’s voice resounded, “Junior Brother Lin, time for us to get going.”

The bitter cultivation in this period was too torturous, even with his Azure Dragon Saint Physique and Blue Dragon Bone.

“Junior Brother Lin!” Mu Qingqing’s voice resounded once more.

“Coming!” Lin Yun’s voice resounded, and he opened the door. Outside the Cloud Soaring Peak, Mu Qingqing looked heroic, donning an azure robe.

“Where have you been? Ye Ziling and others are already out, but you’re nowhere to be found.” Mu Qingqing grumbled.

Lin Yun scratched his head when he heard that because he had been in bitter cultivation for the past two months. It turned out that the Saints’ disciples have already come out of Saint Mountain.

“Weird. Why do I feel like you’ve become more handsome?” Mu Qingqing blinked her eyes as she looked at Lin Yun. For some reason, he looked even more outstanding now, especially his eyes that captivated her. “Many ladies might come after you in this Heavenly Pool Gathering.”

“Senior Sister, you must be joking.” Lin Yun replied.

“Wait… you’ve reached the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm?” Mu Qingqing exclaimed.

Lin Yun merely replied to her with a smile. In reality, he had already reached the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, and he could reach the Dragon Pulse Realm anytime he wanted. But he didn’t want to be the center of attention and used the Black Tortoise Breathing to conceal his strength. If he didn’t attack, others could only feel he was at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

“Your cultivating speed is breakneck!” Mu Qingqing said enviously. “You’re not any slower than the saints’ disciples.”

The saints’ disciples could cultivate on Saint Mountain, receiving the daily guidance of a saint. With all sorts of resources, they reached the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm in one year. But for some reason, Lin Yun’s cultivation speed wasn’t any slower than theirs.
