Chapter 1147 - Birth of the Origin Stone (1)

A full moon hung high in the night sky, but the moonlight couldn’t pierce through the dark of the stone forest. In the darkest portion of the stone forest was a circle formed by numerous stone pillars that had mysterious figures sitting on top.

Every single person was emitting a baleful aura because they were the infamous demonic cultivators of the Profound Azure Sea. At the center of this group was an even more terrifying person.

Even Qin Feng couldn’t be compared to this person. The figure was enveloped in black demonic flames that made him look bizarre and horrifying. His oppressive baleful aura felt suffocating for those who were watching him. Suddenly, his eyes opened, causing everyone around him to cup their hands in respect and fear.

“The Azure Python is dead?” A hoarse voice sounded out from the demonic flames.

“It’s dead,” replied Qin Feng. “Ye Ziling is here, and she’s somewhat troublesome. Her sword intent is too strong and makes her stronger than rumore. After all, the Azure Python was a monarch demonic beast that was powerless before her.

Qin Feng had a deep impression of Ye Ziling, especially the phenomenon she manifested when she executed her sword technique. Even from afar, he was able to sense the power that she radiated.

“So they know about the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal now?” The person enveloped in the demonic flames asked.

“They do. I snuck closer to listen in, but I was discovered by a brat. You know, there’s something weird about him.” Qin Feng’s eyes flashed coldly because he could have listened in a bit longer if it wasn’t for Lin Yun. He might have even had the chance to see if Ye Ziling was injured from the fight.

“Oh?” The person who was enveloped in the demonic flames replied before he fell into silence once more.

A long time later, Qin Feng said carefully, “I think that Ye Ziling might be injured right now. If we go all out on them tonight, we might be able to catch them off guard.”

Qin Feng’s thoughts were bold. Although he was careful with his speech, he couldn’t conceal the insanity flickering in his pupils.

“Then can you ensure that the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal will appear?” A sneer sounded out from the demonic flames.

“This…” Qin Feng began to hesitate. After all, it was found out by the demonic beasts unintentionally. The origin stone of the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal was extremely precious. Perhaps it might be considered a slightly more valuable treasure in the hands of an individual, but the value it had towards the powerful sects of the Ancient Barren Domain would be unimaginable.

After all, the origin stone of the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal represented an entire mine of Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metals!

But the origin stone still needed to be protected and taken care of for decades or centuries before it could turn into a mine. Only in the hands of a powerful sect could the origin stone’s value be fully excavated. It was impossible for anyone here to make full use of the origin stone.

Then again, the information was probably real because aquatic demonic beasts were born with a keen sense for the aura of mines. Will it really be born in seven days?

“I’m at least 99% confident…” Qin Feng said after a brief ponder.

“Since you aren’t certain, why do you want to provoke Ye Ziling? She’s the biological daughter of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s sect master. Everyone calls you a madman, but do you not fear death?” A mocking voice sounded out from the demonic flames that placed immense pressure on Qin Feng.

“What if the origin stone really appears?” Another demonic cultivator asked.

“Haha…hahaha…” The unrestrained laughter from the demonic flames sent chills down everyone’s spines. “As long as there are enough benefits, it’s naturally worth taking a risk. What do you think? Madman Qin, am I right?”

“Of course!” Qin Feng nodded his head.

“There are Elysium Core Realm elders in the camp of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and there are at least two of them!” A demonic cultivator spoke up, confident in his information.

“No problem. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect has declined over the years, and they basically rely on a woman to maintain their reputation. Oh, Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal, you have to appear… no, you must! Otherwise, I won’t be able to make a move against her. After all, I’m a cowardly person…hahaha!” The person enveloped in the demonic flames cried and smiled like a madman.

Although everyone in the circle was a demonic cultivator, they were terrified by the leader. Even Qin Feng, who was called a madman, was nothing in comparison to the insanity of the leader!

Lin Yun’s figure shuttled through the stone forest under the moonlight, and it didn’t take long for him to catch up with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party. They were all seated on the ground resting around a bonfire. Everyone was sitting with a grave expression. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

In just this brief moment, Lin Yun figured everything out. The origin stone would appear right where they were waiting. As he got close, Ye Ziling opened her eyes and nodded her head.

She was deeply poisoned, and her lips had turned purple. But even so, she still looked as prideful as usual.

“You’re finally willing to come back to us. If you took any longer, we would’ve thought that you were running away with the demonic beast’s materials. After all, it’s not worth it for a genius who had ascended the summit of the Sword Saint Mountain to die with us,” said a core disciple named Liu Qingyan. Even the other core disciples around him also looked unhappy. They were all being cautious about their lives, but Lin Yun’s only concern seemed to be the Azure Python’s corpse.

Naturally, they would be unhappy with Lin Yun. However, Lin Yun ignored them and walked towards Ye Ziling with a smile.

When Liu Qingyan saw that Lin Yun was ignoring him, his face turned even darker.

“This is for you.” Lin Yun took out the jade bottle containing the azure python’s gallbladder and handed it to Ye Ziling.

When Ye Ziling opened her eyes, she was shocked. She looked at the jade bottle in silence for a long time. Even the other core disciples also turned their attention over, but none of them knew what it was except for Liu Yuan who had a shock on his face.

Liu Yuan naturally recognized that it was the gallbladder of the azure python, but the gallbladder should be enveloped by venom. It was impossible for any of them to retrieve it. At this moment, he had a completely new impression of Lin Yu. This is why he is a heavenly core disciple.

When Liu Qingyan sensed that the atmosphere wasn’t right, he cleared his throat before whispering to Liu Yuan, “Big Brother Liu, what’s that?”

Liu Yuan had a good nature, so he answered, “That’s the gallbladder of the Azure Python, but I have no idea how he managed to retrieve it. After all, even I would have difficulty cutting the scales of the Azure Python. The gallbladder is enveloped in the Azure Python’s venom, which can penetrate one’s body through the pores. It’s extremely dangerous to get close to the gallbladder, not to mention harvesting it.”

When the other core disciples heard Liu Yuan’s words, they sucked in a cold breath. They were shocked by what Lin Yun was holding. Feng Zhang was the only person who was unfazed. He wasn’t like the other core disciples who believed that Lin Yun didn’t improve in the last six months.
