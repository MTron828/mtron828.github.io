Chapter 1255 - Move Out

The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was situated in a mountain range. Aside from the Sword Sect Mountain, the Flying Snow Peak was the main peak of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and the main hall was also situated here.

Because of the Sword Saint Mountain, the Flying Snow Peak was nameless not only to the outside world but also in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. But there weren’t many restrictions here and disciples could come as they wish, causing everyone to neglect it.

But in reality, the Flying Snow Peak was the highest mountain in the Fleeting Cloud Mountain Range, and it was a lot higher than the Sword Saint Mountain.

The top of the Flying Snow Peak was a forbidden region in the sect since it was the seclusion ground belonging to the sect master. That place was filled with astral energy, and the astral light was also dense, making it the best place to cultivate.

At this moment, a slender figure that was like a white phoenix appeared on the summit. She was unbelievably gorgeous, with a heroic temperament surrounding her. Furthermore, there were also purple flames blazing like blooming flowers in her pupils. She was naturally Ye Ziling.

Sensing her presence, Jian Jingtian slowly opened his eyes and looked at Ye Ziling. “The Divine Dragon Sword Physique has awakened?”

Biting on her lips, Ye Ziling lightly nodded her head.

“That’s good.” Jian Jingtian revealed a gentle smile on his lips.

“But, I’m leaving…” Ye Ziling said.

“It’s fine. Ultimately, you have to leave this place, and it’s also time to unseal your bloodline. You’re the strongest genius of the Ye Clan, so your bloodline talent isn’t weak, either.” Jian Jingtian briefly paused before he continued, “Not to mention that you’re also my daughter.”

“I don’t like the Ye Clan.” Ye Ziling was cold when she mentioned the Radiant Snow Saint Clan.

“Me neither. I only like you and your mother. None of those from the Ye Clan are good,” smiled Jian Jingtian, causing Ye Ziling to smile as well when she heard that. Although the relationship between them was stiff because they were both stubborn, they were also similar at the same time.

“They came to look for you again?” Jian Jingtian asked.

“I refused them,” said Ye Ziling. It was pretty surprising that Ye Ziling was leaving the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but she wasn’t heading to the Radiant Snow Saint Clan.

Jian Jingtian wasn’t surprised and said, “Let’s begin, then. It has been eighteen years, and I want to see how strong you will become after your Radiant Snow Bloodline and Divine Dragon Sword Physique merge together.”

The Radiant Snow Bloodline naturally came from the Radiant Snow Saint Clan. As for the Divine Dragon Sword Physique, it came from Jian Jingtian. But it was a pity the bloodline and physique were too powerful. It would’ve been dangerous if her cultivation wasn’t strong enough and she didn’t have anyone to help her.

Jian Jingtian also had no idea when Ye Ziling would awaken the Divine Dragon Sword Physique, so he had been sealing Ye Ziling’s Radiant Snow Bloodline. This meant that Ye Ziling could only utilize a very small portion of her bloodline.

But since Ye Ziling has awakened the Divine Dragon Sword Physique, the seal on her bloodline could also be released. With Jian Jingtian around, at least Ye Ziling wouldn’t die from the power of her bloodline and physique.

Ye Ziling’s eyes brightly shone when she heard that, since she had been waiting for this moment for a long time. The Radiant Snow Bloodline was like a shackle that was placed on her for a long time. But if it wasn’t unsealed, she wouldn’t be able to gain control over her own life. This was also why Lin Yun felt that there was something weird about Ye Ziling.

Seven days later, when Lin Yun came out of the sword box, Lil’ Purple let out a breath of relief and pouted. She went into the sword box several times over the past few days.

When she saw Lin Yun seated on the jade ice bed shrouded in a mist with draconic roars occasionally resounding, while emanating a powerful aura, Lil’ Purple was puzzled and could only guard outside the sword box.

But who knew that it would take seven days. Just when she was about to complain, surprise flashed through her pupils when she looked at Lin Yun. She could feel that Lin Yun had undergone a transformation, even though there were no changes to his cultivation. Furthermore, the astral light that would occasionally shine from Lin Yun was so dazzling that she had to close her eyes. This was a sign that the astral energy within Lin Yun’s body had reached an exaggerating height.

“What the hell did you eat?” Lil’ Purple asked.

As Lin Yun took a deep breath, he barely managed to suppress his aura before he smiled, “Half a dragon origin pellet.”

He had only refined half a dragon origin pellet, and it allowed the astral river in his violet palace to grow to a thousand feet, coiling around his violet palace like a dragon. This was the limit he could refine his astral energy with his current cultivation, and there was nothing he could do even if he wanted to refine the other half.

But he also didn’t waste his time in the sword box and practiced the second form of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist, the Divine Solar Lunar Cauldron. Moreover, he even brought it to the manifestation stage. At the same time, he also knew why he couldn’t control it in the past. This attack consisted of over a thousand varieties, and the power would reach an unbelievable height after he fully unleashed it.

Thinking about it, a smile rose on the corner of Lin Yun’s lips because this meant that he had another trump card now.

“What are you smiling at?” Lil’ Purple said with her brows locked together.

Lin Yun glanced at Lil’ Purple and asked, instead of answering, “Did anything happen in the past few days?”

“Nothing much. Wang Yuruo visited several times; oh, and the disciples of the main sects. They still didn’t give up on the Sword Saint Mountain, but they quieted down after they were taught a lesson by Mu Qingqing,” said Lil’ Purple.

Mhm? Lin Yun was surprised that Qin Tian didn’t come after him when he gave the latter a slap. He was wondering when Qin Tian would come to take revenge, but he didn’t expect that Qin Tian wouldn’t come. But he soon tossed it to the back of his head.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun carried Lil’ Purple and wanted to leave, since it was about time for them to head to the Profound Wither Island. After hearing that they were going to the Profound Wither Island, Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up, since she was getting bored with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to arrive at the gathering place, but he was shocked by what he saw. There were thousands of people from the Sword Sect and a few hundred quasi-Elysium Core Realm experts. But judging from the fact that they weren’t young, they must be elites that were picked from the Sword Sect’s outer forces, and they would make an immediate breakthrough the moment they entered the Profound Wither Island.

Furthermore, there were also some Elysium Core Realm elders who gave off a terrifying aura. This made Lin Yun’s gaze become serious, since they should be the deacons of the main sects, and disciples when they were younger. This meant that they should be stronger than those in the same cultivation, and just the fact that they could be accepted in the Sword Sect was enough to talk about their talent.

Qin Tian, Zhang Ting, and the rest were gathered around Mu Qingqing, along with several Dragon Pulse Realm elders.

At this moment, Lin Yun knew that what Ye Ziling said to him was true, and the powerful sects have really gone all out for the Profound Wither Island. With the Sword Sect alone having already sent out such a huge formation, Lin Yun couldn’t imagine what it would look like for the other powerful sects.

Furthermore, he predicted that the secondary sects and saint clans would also be attending this event and they were all giants of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. But fortunately, Lin Yun came prepared, or he wouldn’t even be able to cause a splash in the lake.

Just when Lin Yun was filled with emotions, he suddenly recalled what Jian Jingtian previously told him; that he still wasn’t strong enough. As Lin Yun took a deep breath, he saw Jiang Lichen and the rest and walked over to them.

“I thought you wouldn’t be coming before the main sects.” Zhang Ting’s eyes flashed with disdain when he saw Lin Yun.

“Well, I’m famous for not having a temper, unlike someone who casually kneels before others,” replied Lin Yun with a smile.

When Zhang Ting heard that, his face immediately turned black. As his face began to tremble from his anger, he retorted, “I can easily cut you in half if I use my constellation.”

“Wow, I’m really afraid. Why don’t you give it a try?” Lin Yun smiled with a hint of chill flashing through his pupils. Only those who knew him well knew what the chill in his eyes meant.

“Lin Yun.” Ye Ziling called out.

This instantly made Lin Yun back down a little before he smiled. “But it’s a pity that you don’t have the guts.”

Then, Lin Yun shrugged his shoulders and ignored Zhang Ting. This nearly made Zhang Ting throw out a mouthful of blood and the faces of the other disciples weren’t great either because this wasn’t the first time that they were being looked down on by a disciple from a branch sect.

“Why bother with a fly?” Qin Tian’s voice resounded. He didn’t even bat an eye at Lin Yun.

“Senior Brother is right, he’s just a fly. A pitiful worm looking at the sky from a well. When we’re on the Profound Wither Island, he’ll know just how pitiful he is. At that time, he might even beg us when he’s being bullied by the other sects,” smiled Zhang Ting. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Lin Yun didn’t bother with them on Ye Ziling’s behalf. A brief moment later, everyone from the Sword Sect was gathered and one profound astral bird after another flew into the sky. Not long after, half of the people here were already gone.

“Lin Yun, come here.” Ye Ziling sat at the front with Jiang Lichen, Feng Zhang, Liu Qingyan. They were already on the profound astral bird that belonged to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, except Lin Yun, who would occasionally turn back and still showed no signs of jumping on.

“I’m waiting for someone,” said Lin Yun. After all, Luo Hua said that she would come along, but she was still nowhere to be seen.

“Young Master Lin isn’t coming with us? It’s chaotic outside the Profound Wither Island…” Mu Qingqing rose a silver profound astral bird and the meaning behind her words was obvious. Without the Sword Sect’s prestige, just the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect by themselves would have difficulty surviving outside the Profound Wither Island.

“Senior Sister, why are you bothering with him? Who knows, his eyesight might be too high for our Sword Sect,” said Zhang Ting from the side.

“Thank you for your goodwill, Lady Mu. I won’t be coming along with you guys.” Lin Yun rejected.

“Remember to find us if you're in trouble. After all, you’ll be joining the Sword Sect in the future, either way,” smiled Mu Qingqing before she left on her profound astral bird and disappeared into the horizon.

But Lin Yun only smiled in response and found that Mu Qingqing was pretty interesting. He then turned to look at Ye Ziling. “You guys can leave first. I’m waiting for someone.”

Ye Ziling’s face turned cold when she heard that and asked, “What the hell are you talking about?”

“Hehe. Junior Brother Lin, we’ll wait together with you,” smiled Feng Zhang.

Jiang Lichen also smiled. “We have to stick to you no matter what. After all, not even the Sword Sect might be able to hold their front on the Profound Wither Island.”

Regardless of whether they were joking or not, Lin Yun felt warmth from their words. Just when they were about to walk, a white figure swiftly flew over from the clouds.
