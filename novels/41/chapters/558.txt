Chapter 559 - Unbelievable

Huang Yan’s disdainful tone instantly made the surrounding atmosphere feel tense. Liu Yunyan’s eyes flashed with rage, but she was held back by Mo Ling who signaled her to calm down.

However, many Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples turned to look at Lin Yun. They didn’t look down on Lin Yun. After all, they had witnessed how powerful Lin Yun was. They even had a favorable impression of Lin Yun, but they didn’t think he was comparable to Huang Yan.

After all, Lin Yun was only in the pinnacle Yin stage while Huang Yan was in the lesser Yang stage. In terms of foundation, one of them was from the Profound Yang Palace, while the other was from the Great Qin Empire. Huang Yan was like a proud eagle soaring through the sky.

“Am I wrong?” Huang Yan looked around. He glanced at Lin Yun before turning to look at Liu Yunyan, ”Yunyan, I swear that I’ll take revenge for the burden that you’ve been carrying for the past two decades.”

Liu Yunyan and Mo Ling weren’t only famous in the academy, but they were also famous in the city. Huang Yan knew that there was no hope in trying to get Mo Ling. After all, Mo Ling was a genius on the Dragoncloud Ranking. Even a core disciple of the Profound Yang Palace would have a great difficulty trying to make it into the Dragoncloud Ranking, not to mention the fact that Mo Ling might become the new dean in the future.

On the other hand, Liu Yunyan’s talent was weaker than Mo Ling, so Huang Yan could make use of this opportunity to try and win her over. This was the reason why he agreed when Mei Ziyan came to look for him, but Lin Yun suddenly came out of nowhere.

“This fellow is really despicable.”

“He’s taking advantage of Senior Sister Liu’s situation.”

“What can we do about it? He’s a genius from the Profound Yang Palace…” Huang Yan’s words instantly caused displeasure in the hearts of many disciples in the surroundings, but no one dared to say a word because of Huang Yan’s identity.

“I’m sorry, but I have on intention of asking for your help. I share the same thoughts of Senior Sister Mo, we both think that Young Master Lin is more suitable,” said Liu Yunyan as she rejected Huang Yan.

Mei Ziyan smiled indifferently as he spoke eerily, “Junior Sister Liu, there are things that you can’t refuse whether you like it or not. Brother Huang will be the outside quota of our academy. I don’t believe that the disciple of an overlord force isn’t comparable to someone who came from nowhere.”

“I don’t think so. Do you not know that the dean gave Lin Yun a Yin-Yang Jadecloud Pellet?” Mo Ling said with a playful smile.

The faces of Mei Ziyan and Mu Xue changed when they heard that.

“The Yin-Yang Jadecloud Pellet has to be refined with the profound earth fire. The profound earth fire can only be used once a year, so it can only be used to refine one pellet each time. Grandfather actually used it to refine one for him?” Mu Xue was shocked when she looked at Lin Yun. After hearing Mu Xue’s explanation, Lin Yun understood why the pellet was so powerful.

“So what? I bet the dean only did that to compensate Lin Yun,” sneered Mei Ziyan. He clearly had no intentions of taking a step back.

“What’s the use of us arguing here? I heard you just became a third grade spiritualist and that you’re more proficient in your martial cultivation. What a coincidence, I’m also proficient in my martial cultivation. Do you dare to spar with me?” Huang Yan said as his eyes turned dark. He sneered with disdain, “It’s more direct to speak with our fists. You shouldn’t refuse this, right?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Clearly, Huang Yan loathed Lin Yun. He wanted to humiliate Lin Yun in front of the elders so they could come to a decision. At that time, Lin Yun would be too embarrassed to occupy a quota.

“How do you want to spar?” said Lin Yun. Lin Yun’s agreement had caused Mo Ling and Liu Yunyan to become nervous. After all, Huang Yan was clearly stronger in terms of his cultivation. At the same time, the other disciples in the surroundings were also shocked.

This fellow is rather bold. Isn’t he afraid of being humiliated? But this is for the better. He won’t have the face to occupy a quota anymore when he loses. Mu Xue muttered inwardly as she examined Lin Yun. She had confidence in Huang Yan, who also came from an overlord force. So in her view, Lin Yun’s loss was a guarantee.

“Great. Since we’re going to compete with our cultivation, then this will be easy. Both of us will attack at once, but neither of us are allowed to dodge. Whoever gets injured will quit,” smiled Huang Yan as he raised his brow. He never expected that Lin Yun would agree so directly.

“Very well,” replied Lin Yun.

“I won’t bully you. You can start first,” said Huang Yan as he licked his lips with a smile. “However, if you lose, you can’t react embarrassingly.”

“No need. Since you want to chase me away, why don’t you start first? You should think about yourself being embarrassed instead,” said Lin Yun as his eyes flashed coldly. Simultaneously, his words caused everyone in the surroundings to look at Lin Yun with shock.

“Tsk, tsk. Brother Huang, since this fellow wants to die, you might as well fulfil his wish.” Mei Ziyan was stunned before he laughed eerily.

“As you wish!” Huang Yan’s eyes turned cold as his killing aura rose. A small fry from the Great Qin Empire actually dared to look down on him? Before he finished speaking, his eyes flashed coldly as he appeared in front of Lin Yun and threw out a punch.

“Profound Yang Heart-shattering Palm!” Huang Yan’s origin energy blazed on his palm like a volcano as he smashed Lin Yun’s chest. This attack made everyone suck in a cold breath as they were shocked by the power of this palm. Even many of the elders wouldn’t dare to take this attack head-on.

When Lin Yun was hit by the palm, the ground trembled violently as a cloud of dust rose up and engulfed Lin Yun. Huang Yan stood outside the cloud of dust with a sinister smirk on his lips. He knew how terrifying this palm was, so he was confident that Lin Yun would either be heavily injured or dead.

“Who do you think you are to act with such arrogance before me?” Huang Yan’s expression was cold.

“Hmmm?” But right at this moment, after the dust cloud settled down, everyone noticed that Lin Yun was still standing in front of Huang Yan. Lin Yun had only taken three steps back.

When Huang Yan raised his head, he saw Lin Yun shrouded in ancient armor. The armor was covered in cracks, but Lin Yun was unharmed.

H-how is this possible?! Huang Yan was shocked. He had used 80% of his strength in this attack, so it made no sense for Lin Yun to be unharmed. However, Lin Yun was standing in front of him unscathed.

As the armor crumbled, Lin Yun asked calmly, “Is it my turn now?”

Huang Yan was briefly stunned before he replied, “Your skin is really thick. But if you don’t use all your strength, you won’t be able to make me take half a step back.

“Is that so?” Lin Yun began to form a terrifying seal with his left hand. In the next second, a torrential killing aura was released after being multiplied seven times.

Huang Yan was shocked as he quickly gathered himself to use all his origin energy for protection.

Seven Slaughtering Fist—Omnipresent Anger!

But before Huang Yan could gather his origin energy, he was sent flying by a punch that caused the ground to shake violently. Huang Yan really didn’t take a step back, but his chest was caved in. His ribs were broken and his internal organs were ravaged by the killing aura behind the punch.

Huang Yan threw up a huge mouthful of blood as his face turned pale and he dropped down on one knee.

“Brother Huang, are you alright?” Mei Ziyan’s face changed as he quickly rushed over.

“Stay where you are. Such injuries can’t do anything to me…” Huang Yan’s face was distorted, but he still stopped Mei Ziyan from helping him as he struggled to get back up.

But before Huang Yan could get back up, Lin Yun kicked him and sent him flying into a corner. “You should obediently stay back, Mei Ziyan.” Everyone’s lips twitched from this scene because they couldn’t imagine how heavy Lin Yun’s attack was.

As Huang Yan gently slipped down from the wall, he fell onto the ground unconscious. This silenced the crowd as they looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. They couldn’t believe that a genius from the overlord force was actually lying unconscious after being kicked by Lin Yun.

Mei Ziyan was completely dumbfounded when he saw this scene and his mouth was wide open.
