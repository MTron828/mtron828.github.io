Chapter 1223 - Sanity

In the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s residence assigned by the Profound Azure City, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party came back with depressed faces. They had to face the Suspend King Palace tomorrow, but they felt despair after witnessing the Suspend King Palace’s strength.

They couldn’t see any hope of victory at all, not to mention that the Suspend King Palace didn’t even bring out a third of their strength to defeat the Azure Thunder Monastery. Just Qin Yang alone was comparable to Ye Ziling, not to mention the chief disciple, Chu Tianhao.

Even if they got lucky tomorrow and had Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan face Chu Tianhao and Qin Yang, the victory would depend on Jiang Lichen. Jiang Lichen lost to an ordinary opponent from the Heavenly Astral Pavilion and nearly buried the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

No matter how Lin Yun looked at it, even someone like Feng Zhang had more potential than Jiang Lichen.

“Junior Brother Lin, do you really have an idea?” Liu Qingyan asked, drawing the attention of everyone.

“I do,” replied Lin Yun.

“What are our odds?” Liu Qingyan asked.

“If we’re lucky in the matchup, it will be five to zero,” said Lin Yun.

Hearing that, everyone’s faces twitched because Lin Yun was a little too depressing. But right at this moment, Lin Yun winked and smiled, “I meant we will win all five battles.”

Lin Yun’s boldness stunned everyone. Ye Ziling didn’t say a word and simply stared at Lin Yun in shock. However, Jiang Lichen couldn’t help doubting Lin Yun’s words. Even though he had a better understanding of Lin Yun after the battle, he still couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Junior Brother Lin, isn’t that a little too unrealistic? Even if you’re strong, this is a team battle.”

Ye Ziling also shook her head silently while Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan smiled bitterly. Feng Zhang smiled, “Junior Brother Lin, you’re not joking, right? How can we possibly win all five battles?”

“Do I look like I’m joking? Or do all of you think you’re just garbage?” Lin Yun started to get annoyed as his face turned cold. As a cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupil, he continued, “Or do all of you think that I’m garbage?”

“We didn’t…” Everyone else quickly denied it under Lin Yun’s pressuring aura.

But Ye Ziling was surprised because she had never seen Lin Yun so serious before ever since he came to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. She began to wonder if Lin Yun was actually being serious right now.

“It might sound impossible, but I believe you since you’re someone who reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm,” said Ye Ziling as she waited for Lin Yun’s explanation.

Taking a step forward, Lin Yun said, “It’s impossible for us to win all five battles against the Azure Thunder Monastery or the Thousand Crane Pavilion. But it’s possible with the Suspend King Palace. After witnessing the Suspend King Palace’s battle today, I realized that they only rely on their Suspend King Art or the monarch aura to crush their opponents.”

The Suspend King Art was famous and even someone like Ye Ziling who had grasped the sky sword intent wouldn’t be able to obtain any advantage against Chu Tianhao.

“The Suspend King Art is strong, but what if I can help you guys to display your full strength tomorrow in front of the Suspend King Art?” Lin Yun turned around and looked at everyone while he dropped a bomb.

It felt unbelievable to everyone that Lin Yun could make them immune to the Suspend King Art’s pressure in just one night. If Lin Yun really managed to do it, then the Suspend King Art would be useless in front of them.

“Why isn’t it impossible? There’s nothing certain in the world.” Lin Yun paused briefly before he turned to look at Jiang Lichen, “What you said isn’t wrong either because I’ll leave the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect sooner or later. It’s not a secret and I believe Senior Sister Ye already knows it too. Even if I help you right now, you will lose in the future if none of you improve.”

When he said that, the surrounding atmosphere suddenly became heavy. Then, Lin Yun turned to look at Feng Zhang and asked, “Your sword intent is at the pinnacle spiritual sword intent, right?”

“Yeah, that’s right.” Feng Zhang replied.

“Pinnacle spiritual…” Lin Yun muttered before he suddenly turned around with a sword intent that began to crush Feng Zhang. Feng Zhang’s back was covered with sweat as he quickly brought out all of his sword intent. But his spiritual sword intent only lasted for a split second before it crumbled.

As Feng Zhang threw up a mouthful of blood, he was sent flying. When he fell to the ground on one knee, shock filled his pupils. This scene left everyone confused because they could sense that Lin Yun had only used greater spiritual sword intent to crush Feng Zhang’s pinnacle spiritual sword intent. It was incredible.

“Sword intent can resist the monarch aura. Despite what you’re thinking, I’m not a peerless genius. I’ve merely had more life and death experiences than all of you. Throughout my journeys, I’ve never once given up on pursuing the sword,” said Lin Yun. His tone was calm, but everyone could imagine what he had experienced for his sword intent to become so strong.

If Lin Yun hadn’t experienced life and death in the Profound Amber Realm, there was no way he could become the champion in the Heavenly Path. Feng Zhang, Liu Qingyan, and Jiang Lichen all had a higher starting point than him, and they were all geniuses as well.

As for Ye Ziling, there was naturally nothing to say about her since she was a descendant of an ancient saint clan who was in possession of a terrifying bloodline. If it wasn’t for the obsession in her heart, she would’ve left everyone behind based on the talent contained in her bloodline.

“I’ll share my insights in the sword with all of you. However, the amount that you absorb will depend on you.” Lin Yun swept his glance around before he sat down and began the process.

Everyone’s hearts throbbed as they quickly sat down to listen. Even Wang Yuruo and Ye Ziling were briefly stunned before they sat down as well.

Lin Yun shared so fast that no one had time to ask questions. After an hour passed, Lin Yun finished sharing his insights in the sword.

“Next up will be a practical lesson. Anyone who can come within five feet of me won’t have to fear the monarch aura tomorrow. You might even be able to crush your opponent!” Lin Yun said while he unleashed his sword intent. His sword intent took everyone by surprise, causing everyone but Ye Ziling to go flying. When the others hit the ground, they could feel their bones falling apart.

“Holy shit, you’re actually serious!” Liu Qingyan murmured. Feng Zhang’s face was also distorted with pain as his situation wasn’t any better.

“Yuruo, come over to my side,” said Lin Yun looking at Wang Yuruo who fell onto the ground.

But this time, Wang Yuruo didn’t listen to him and shook her head with stubbornness flickering in her pupils. This made Lin Yun nod his head before he looked at Liu Qingyan and the rest, “Even she can do it, so don’t tell me that you men can’t do it. Get up on your feet quickly and stop embarrassing yourselves.”

As Jiang Lichen, Feng Zhang, and Liu Qingyan struggled to get on their feet, they endured the pressure from Lin Yun and managed to get 15 feet away from Lin Yun. However, Lin Yun suddenly pushed his sword intent to sky sword intent and sent them flying.

The sword aura that Lin Yun was giving off at this moment was too terrifying. His sword aura didn’t just restrict their sword aura, but completely crushed them. To a swordsman, it was the same as crushing their bones one by one and giving them unimaginable pain. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Is this the best you can do? How disappointing. I haven’t even brought out my full strength. All of you, get up!” Lin Yun barked. At the same time, an Azure Dragon appeared around him and perfectly merged with his sword aura. Under this newly combined pressure, the three men could feel a colossal mountain crashing down on them that they couldn’t resist no matter how hard they tried.

Aside from Ye Ziling, everyone’s faces were distorting in pain as their bones cracked from the immense pressure. They knew that Lin Yun was strong when he was in the Heavenly Soul Realm, but they didn't know that Lin Yun would become exponentially stronger after reaching the Empyrean Realm. At the same time, they never expected that they couldn’t even stand before Lin Yun’s sword aura. It was even worse because they couldn’t see the limit of Lin Yun’s sword intent!

“Feng Zhang, where did your temper go? Didn’t you tell me that an empyrean couldn’t be humiliated? Where is your pride?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he spoke to Feng Zhang who was struggling to get back up.

His words made Feng Zhang’s face turn ugly because Lin Yun had touched his sore spot. Gritting his teeth, he pushed his sword intent to the limit while he recalled the profundity of sky sword intent that Lin Yun shared previously.

As he struggled under Lin Yun’s sword aura, the flow of his sword intent became faster. Then, he slowly stood up. It was so shocking that Jiang Lichen and Liu Qingyan couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

Feng Zhang couldn’t forget the humiliation he suffered back in the Sword Saint Mountain. However, he didn’t hate Lin Yun because he was the one who asked to be humiliated back then. He only hated himself for being so weak!

Gritting his teeth, Feng Zhang slowly stood up under Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Aura. The moment he got back up, Lin Yun glanced at him and an invisible sword aura collided against his chest.

Everyone could hear Feng Zhang’s bones cracking, which made Liu Qingyan and Jiang Lichen look at Lin Yun furiously. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun was acting so ruthlessly.

“Hahaha! Not enough! Lin Yun, make me kneel if you can!” However, before they could say anything, Feng Zhang let out a maniacal burst of laughter as he stood back up.

Glancing at Feng Zhang, Lin Yun spoke indifferently, “As you wish!”

In the next second, the sword cocoon in his forehead emitted a faint light as he unleashed his quasi-divine firmament sword intent. On top of that, Lin Yun retrieved the Lightning Shadow Sword from his sword box. When he held onto the sword scabbard, the sword aura suddenly plunged everyone into darkness and even Ye Ziling began to tremble under the pressure.
