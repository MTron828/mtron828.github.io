Chapter 1207: Shining Brightly (2)

“This bastard!” Feng Xuanzi’s body trembled while gritting his teeth. His eyes were fixed on Lin Yun as he couldn’t wait for the elders to kill Lin Yun.

Once Feng Tianyuan lost his life, the swords from the three elders also stabbed Lin Yun’s chest.

All three swords pierced through Lin Yun’s chest straight to his back.

The three elders had lived for centuries, so they were experienced when it came to fighting. They had long discovered that Lin Yun’s heart was comparable to a saint artifact, so they chose to stab Ln Yun’s chest instead. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Lin Yun’s crimson runes were mostly destroyed, which shocked the crowd.

Although they knew that Lin Yun was willing to put his life in danger to kill Feng Tianyuan, they still couldn’t believe that he did it. It was mind boggling that one would leave themselves vulnerable to the attacks of three elders.

Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood as his face turned terrifyingly pale. At the same time, the Demonic Astral Flowers in the surroundings disappeared and the sky became bright.

Lin Yun opened his eyes and faced the bright sky. Under the sunlight, the purple mark on his forehead looked even more bewitching than normal. With a slight bow, he threw up more blood and dropped his sword. He looked like a sun that had lost all of its luster.

The three elders continued their vicious attacks as they plunged their swords into Lin Yun’s chest until their hilts couldn’t move any further. Then, they retreated and hovered in the air.

Lin Yun was blasted away like a fallen leaf that was tottering on the verge of collapse. Everyone could clearly see the vitality in Lin Yun’s body disappearing swiftly. But even though Lin Yun’s vitality was disappearing, everyone could clearly sense that Lin Yun was full of fighting spirit.

His sword aura that should’ve collapsed managed to persevere because of his spirit. But the sword aura was scattered and couldn’t come together because the three swords were sealing him.

If I’m like a dying sun, I’ll ignite my life and join the darkness. A violent gale blew across the stage as as sword hum echoed out. Lin Yun’s hair slowly fluttered in the wind as his sword aura violently rose. Then, his vitality swiftly disappeared.

Under everyone’s shock, Lin Yun was exhausting his own life to ignite his sword aura. He’s insane! No one could believe that Lin Yun was still trying to win.

“This fellow still wants to turn the tables around? He must be dreaming!” Feng Xuanzi roared, “Kill him!”

The three elders were waiting for this moment. The reason why they retreated previously was because they didn’t want to risk dying with Lin Yun. After all, his sword aura was rising once more.

Now that they had seen Lin Yun’s trump card, there was no need for them to drag things out. The three of them charged toward Lin Yun like a bolt of lightning. Lin Yun still had three swords in his body, so he couldn’t turn the tables.

The elders formed seals with their hands and made their swords vibrate in Lin Yun’s body. However, Lin Yun wasn’t fazed. He took a deep breath and slowly closed his eyes. He already accepted that this situation would be dangerous.

He had had no other options, so he had to go to these lengths. Lin Yun placed his hands on his knees and circulated the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra to the best of his ability despite being suppressed by the swords in his chest.

Azure Birds flew into the sky as Lin Yun focused. It didn’t take long before the three elders appeared in front of him. They reached for their swords to slice Lin Yun in half.

“Condense!” Lin Yun spread his arms apart as he began to form seals swiftly with his fingers, causing the sky to suddenly turn dark with lightning rumbling in the sky.

“What’s going on?” The audience was all shocked as they raised their heads.

“Quick! Quick!” The faces of the three elders changed because they could sense danger looming over them. However, they were too slow.

“Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords—Myriad Sword Condensation!” A complete sword seal formed in Lin Yun’s hands as the Azure Birds perfectly fused into the genuine holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. It was an ancient sword enveloped in purple lightning that looked down on the world.

When the three elders raised their heads, the sword ray instantly dissolved their eyeballs and blood flowed down out of their eye sockets. All three of them howled in pain as they clutched their faces.

That azure sword was like the king of all swords, causing countless swords in the Hidden Sword Pavilion to fly over. As a myriad of swords flew over to Lin Yun, they lost their luster and turned rusty. Lin Yun’s holy spirit was devouring the luster of all the incoming sword.

From far away, the audience raised their heads and looked at the stage with deep shock in their eyes.

“My eyes!”

“Damn it, what the hell is this?!” Everyone was trembling in fear because the Hidden Sword Pavilion couldn’t stand up to the azure sword.

Everyone from the Feng Clan was filled with despair because the swords that Lin Yun devoured were dao artifacts and saint swords.

Unimaginable fear gripped the hearts of everyone from the Feng Clan. With so many of their swords getting destroyed, they suffered an incomparable loss. When Feng Xuanzi saw this, he spit up blood once again.

When Lin Yun’s seal changed, the swords in his chest flew towards the elders. They were hit by their own swords and threw up blood. At the same time, Lin Yun’s vitality also stopped flowing away.

The swords of the elders were extremely dangerous and Lin Yun would have died if it weren’t for his physique. But even so, it was still dangerous for him.

The three elders were terrifyingly cautious, but that’s why Lin Yun was able to beat them. They became overly cautious when Lin Yun killed Feng Tianyuan, so they chose the safest method to deal with Lin Yun.

There was nothing wrong with this because even a swordsman would have to respect death. But true victory would only go to genuine swordsmen who took risks.

When Lin Yun’s vitality stopped slipping away, he shook his arms and executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations. After nine steps in the air, he caught up to the three elders that he sent flying. As golden light radiated off him, the Flower Burial Sword flew into his hand.

Before the three elders could even react, they were devoured by the sword ray and their heads went flying.

Standing on the stage, Lin Yun shined brightly as he glanced at his sword.
