Chapter 2465 - The Rumor Is True

After toasting the wine to Lin Yun, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint began toasting with the sect masters of the ten holy lands present. As for the other sword saints, he could only toast them altogether as it would take too long to do it individually.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint looked at Lin Yun and smiled, “This is a rare opportunity. Since all the famous sword saints are gathered here today, why don’t we have an exchange?”

“My pleasure,” Lin Yun smiled.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint smiled, “They all say you’re here to challenge you to become the strongest. So, you’re the protagonist of this gathering, and you can decide on the rules.”

Since it was an exchange, there were bound to be battles. But everyone present was older than Lin Yun, so the Dao Suspend Sword Saint told Lin Yun to create the rules.

“There were rumors that I’ve refined the Heavenly Dragon Bone...” Lin Yun looked around and smiled.

When he said that, everyone held their breaths and turned to look at him. That was especially the case for swordsmen of the Heavenly Dragon Monastery.

“Let me clarify that it’s not a rumor. So, there’s no need to hold back in our exchange,” Lin Yun smiled.

All the swordsmen present took in a deep breath. They all thought it was merely a rumor, but Lin Yun admitted.

Lin Yun looked around and smiled, “As for rules, there are no rules. You can go all out and try to beat me to death; the Heavenly Dragon Bone has a high resistance for beating.”

All the swordsmen present were briefly stunned upon hearing that before they smiled because Lin Yun wasn’t just arrogant. Even the Dao Suspend Sword Saint was stumped when he heard what Lin Yun said.

“Flower Burial,” Yu Qingfeng’s youngest disciple, Jian Jue, stood up and smiled at Lin Yun. He continued, “I reached the Great Saint Realm ten years ago. Since there are no rules, I won’t hold back. Why don’t we have an exchange?”

The eyes of all the swordsmen in the surroundings lit up. After all, there wasn’t a single person here who hadn’t heard of Jian Jue, and he was unbeatable among the younger generation many years ago. He might be over seventy years old now, but he was of the younger generation in the eyes of many over a thousand years old.

Jian Jue was a test. If Lin Yun couldn’t even defeat Jian Jue, he wouldn’t qualify to become the strongest swordsman in the world.

“My pleasure.” Lin Yun soared to the sky and landed at the plaza's center, looking at Jian Jue calmly.

“Be careful,” the Dao Suspend Sword Saint said, which Jian Jue nodded and came to the center of the plaza as well.

Jian Jue and Lin Yun looked at each other with their sword intent released. But Jian Jue soon sensed that something wasn’t right because his sword intent had already reached the pinnacle, but Lin Yun still looked at him with a smile, seemingly unaffected by his sword intent. He knew he couldn’t wait any longer and said, “Come!”

Jian Jue no longer held back and unleashed his sword intent. This caused all the swords on the plaza to buzz, and Jian Jue’s sword aura soon reached its peak. It was the eighth-grade sword intent, the Bright Sun Sword Intent. But that wasn’t Jian Jue’s limit as he also grasped the Great Solar Dao.

When the eighth-grade Great Solar Dao and Bright Sun Sword Intent merged, it became comparable to the ninth-grade sword intent. With a wave of his hand, a sword appeared in Jian Jue’s hand and executed the Great Solar Sword Art that he was famed for; it was a sword technique that Yu Qingfeng taught him.

This sword technique was famous and ranked in the top three in the Kunlun Realm. Even someone in the Emperor Realm might not be able to unleash the full power of this sword technique.

With a wave of his hand, Jian Jue unleashed a dazzling sword ray that forced everyone to shut their eyes, enveloping the plaza in a dazzling radiance. Many holy lands’ sect masters nodded inwardly, acknowledging Jian Jue’s talent and strength. A hundred years from now, Jian Jue can take over Skysolute City.

Lin Yun frowned, thinking he had sensed it wrongly because Jian Jue seemed weak.

The incoming attack was too powerful, and it was hard for Lin Yun to avoid the sword after being distracted briefly. Lin Yun forcibly dodged the incoming attack. The sword brushed past his cheeks, leaving behind a shallow wound on his cheeks and slicing off several strands of hair.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint smiled, stroking his beard.

“Be careful. My sword is fast, and this is only the beginning,” Jian Jue smiled and executed the Great Solar Sword Art even faster. His sword was fast, leaving behind countless afterimages.

The crowd exclaimed with Jian Jue executed over a hundred swords. Most importantly, the surroundings became scorching hot when the Great Solar Sword Domain spread out, greatly restricting movement techniques.

That didn’t seem like a misconception. Lin Yun muttered inwardly and pushed his right hand forward. Regardless of the incoming attacks, Lin Yun merely pushed his hand, and all the attacks shattered.

The powerful shockwave forced Jian Jue to retreat, and his sword intent was like a small raft in the ocean. This sent Jian Jue flying out, who looked at Lin Yun with shock after landing on the ground.

“My sword has reached the realm of fast and slow. There’s no weakness between fast and slow,” Lin Yun smiled. After comprehending Yin-Yang Dao, Lin Yun's profoundness allowed him to kill regardless of whether he used a fast or slow sword.

Jian Jue was proud of his fast sword, and there wasn’t much difference between his cultivation and Lin Yun. But there was a massive gulf regarding their comprehension of the sword. When Jian Jue stood back up, he couldn’t accept his defeat and asked, “Are you messing with me? I have yet to bring out my full...”

“There’s no difference,” Lin Yun said lazily. With a raise of his hand, Jian Jue was dragged over.

Jian Jue still didn’t give up, wanting to strike when he got close, catching Lin Yun by surprise.

But Lin Yun had seen through his intentions, pushing him back out after pulling him over. Just like that, a bizarre scene unfolded before all the swordsmen as Jian Jue’s body flew back and forth, and he was being toyed with by Lin Yun. The faces of Skysolute City’s disciples turned black when they saw this scene.

Jian Jingtian couldn’t help laughing upon seeing this.

Ye Guhan reprimanded, “Lin Yun, what are you doing? Let him go!”

“Oh.” Lin Yun casually waved his hand, dismissing his sword intent that enveloped the plaza with Jian Jue blown back out.

All the Skysolute City’s disciples looked at Lin Yun furiously. The Dao Suspend Sword Saint’s face turned black because Lin Yun was messing around with Jian Jue.

“Since there are no rules, why don’t we have a few exchanges?” A person of the Skysolute City’s lineage couldn’t hold back and stood out; this was a middle-aged man. He was Jian Jue’s senior brother, Chu Liang, an old sword saint with cultivation in the pinnacle Boundless Stage of the Great Saint Realm.

“I’m over eight hundred years old. It was unfair for me to fight you, but since you’ve refined the Heavenly Dragon Bone, it won’t be unfair to you.” Chu Liang introduced himself and looked at Lin Yun furiously.

Lin Yun smiled, “Of course not. Didn’t I say that the Heavenly Dragon Bone can take a beating?”

“Here I come, then!” Chu Liang released his cultivation as sword daos began to appear behind him. He was a powerful Great Saint, not to mention he was Yu Qingfeng’s disciple. Thus, his talent for the sword wasn’t weak.

When Lin Yun tried pushing his hand, he discovered he couldn’t budge Chu Liang. This was because Chu Liang’s cultivation was too powerful, not to mention he was an entire stage higher than Lin Yun in terms of cultivation. This was why Lin Yun’s Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent couldn’t budge him.

Furthermore, Chu Liang was older, which meant he had a firm foundation in his cultivation. Seeing that Lin Yun tried to use the trick he used to toy around with Jian Jue, Chu Liang instantly exploded.

“Flower Burial, don’t push it! Do you think the Sword Emperor’s lineage has no one, and you can casually toy with us?” Chu Liang was furious and didn’t hold back. As he stepped forward, the aura he gave off would increase.

Lin Yun was startled by his fiery temper and smiled, “This is a misunderstanding. I’m just giving it a try. Don’t be in a hurry, and let me try again.”

This time, Lin Yun circulated his Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique. The Azure Dragon Constellation sensed him and opened its eyes in the starry sky.

“You’re courting death!” Chu Liang was furious, hearing Lin Yun still wanted to try it. He roared, “Do you think I’m a pushover?!”

But when he finished, Lin Yun pushed his hand forward again, merging the Heavenly Dragon’s aura and sword intent. This made Chu Liang freeze mid-air before he took an impact and was sent flying away.

“Come back!” But Lin Yun executed the Azure Dragon’s Grasp before Chu Liang landed on the ground.

But Chu Liang dodged in the nick of time, and a black vortex appeared where he initially stood. This startled everyone and shocked them greatly.

“Not bad,” Lin Yun smiled and began moving his hand. His movement was slow, and his sword intent began to flow like a river. After the Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent and Heavenly Dragon’s aura merged, it felt like a roaring river and heavenly dragons that swept towards Chu Liang.

This left Chu Liang shocked, and he quickly dodged the incoming wave. But Lin Yun was calm as the aura swiftly caught up with Chu Liang, closing up on him. Ultimately, Chu Liang was swept by the sword intent, and his struggle proved futile mid-air.

“Go back!” Lin Yun smiled and shoved his hand, sending Chu Liang flying out in the same manner as Jian Jue. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This scene shocked all the swordsmen present as they looked at Lin Yun in shock. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun had become so powerful.

“Lin Yun, you’re too much!” Everyone from the Skysolute City’s lineage became furious. Four figures couldn’t hold back and charged at Lin Yun, all in the Great Saint Realm. They might not have reached the Immortal Stage, but the aura that they gave off was stronger than Chu Liang's.

“Three thousand Greater Daos, but only the Sword is supreme!” Lin Yun muttered and spread his arms apart.

Nine thousand cloth engraved with divine runes swept out like a waterfall, containing boundless sword intent. Facing the incoming four great saints, Lin Yun shoved his hand forth.

In the next second, the four Great Saints threw out a mouthful of blood and sent flying out; they couldn’t even get close to Lin Yun.

Everyone looked at Lin Yun with shock and could feel their scalps numb, looking at the youth standing on the cloth.

Even Jian Jingtian was shocked by this scene because he hadn’t expected Lin Yun to be so severe.

All the swordsmen from the Skysolute City were stumped and looked at Lin Yun horrifiedly.

When the plaza fell into dead silence, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint stood up with a grave expression. He looked at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze and said tremblingly, “Young lad, I’m not bullying you to fight you, right?”
