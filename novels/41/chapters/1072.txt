Chapter 1073 - No Hesitation!

Everything happened too quickly. Lin Yun practically dominated the Imperial Diagram Realm Son in a split second with the swing of his sword. Even though the Realm Sons brought out their holy spirits to deal with Lin Yun, the pressure wasn’t enough. For the crowd, it was a spectacular sight to see many holy spirits at once.

However, watching the Imperial Diagram Realm Son in desperate straits put great pressure on the Realm Sons. They controlled their holy spirits as best they could and swiftly formed seals to deal with Lin Yun.

As they approached Lin Yun, the pressure from their holy spirits had reached an unprecedented height. They were able to make the phenomenon of Lin Yun’s attack start to crack. It was shocking that Lin Yun’s sword intent managed to withstand the attack of numerous holy spirits.

“I’m really surprised that everyone stood up for us even though we don’t have a good relationship,” said the Profound Dragon Realm Son.

“Help us? You’re overthinking things. If they really wanted to help us, they would’ve stepped in the moment I got slapped. They’re just using this as an excuse to suppress Lin Yun. After all, the prize of being the champion is a Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit. They can’t allow Lin Yun to take everything so easily,” snorted the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

“Your arm,” said the Elysium Trigram Realm Son as he walked over with a severed arm.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s face changed with rage blazing in his pupils. He replied, “That imbecile is really ruthless. I can only try and reconnect it once when we’re in Kunlun Realm. The other Realm Sons are up to something. Let me tell you guys a secret…”

The two moved towards the Nether Divinity Realm Son, and their faces changed when they heard what the Nether Divinity Realm Son said.

“Isn’t there a restriction at the bottom of the lake?” The Profound Dragon Realm Son whispered.

“Hehe, so what if there’s a restriction? Lin Yun is destined to die anyway. Lin Yun, we’ll see who has the last laugh.” The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s gaze turned cold as he entered the Saint Spiritual Lake with the Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons. They managed to slip away while everyone was paying attention to Lin yun.

“Lin Yun, why do you have to act like this? If you swing your sword, your sword aura will be exhausted by half. Then, the holy spirits will be able to kill you. There’s no need for us to take it so far,” said the Imperial Diagram Realm Son with fear flashing through his pupils. He was using his fear to conceal his actions while he poured his vitality into the throne behind him. But even so, he was trembling.

“Lin Yun, surrender now and we can consider letting you off,” roared one of the Realm Sons.

“Lin Yun, did you hear that? Give up. We have no intention of making you an enemy as long as you’re willing to let the Nether Divinity Realm Son go,” said the Imperial Diagram Realm Son with more confidence on his face.

The Realm Sons holy spirits gave him confidence that he would make it out alive. So he began to plan ways to make Lin Yun feel regret. After all, how could he possibly allow an ant act with such arrogance before him?

Everyone in the Saint Spiritual Lake was nervous and didn’t dare to utter a word as they stared at Lin Yun, waiting for him to make the decision. They all knew that Lin Yun wasn’t in a good situation with six Realm Sons approach. Plus, he still had to face the Imperial Diagram Realm Son. If he was willing to take a step back now, he would still be attractive in the eyes of the powerful sects.

“What are you thinking? Do you still want to express your so-called goodwill to me even now? You’re not the one making the decisions, I am. And I want your life!” Contrary to everyone’s expectations, Lin Yun spat in the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s face.

The Imperial Diagram Realm Son provoked him time and time again. In a certain sense, the Imperial Diagram Realm Son was even more annoying than the Nether Divinity Realm Son, so how could he let the Imperial Diagram Realm Son off?

When the Imperial Diagram Realm Son, who was still trying to persuade Lin Yun, noticed Lin Yun’s rising sword intent, his face became dark. With a roar, he took the initiative to launch an attack and screamed, “You want to kill me? Well you can die first!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

With a sinister smile, the Imperial Diagram Realm Son charged towards Lin Yun. Throwing a punch, a majestic figure wearing a crown descended from the sky behind the Imperial Diagram Realm Son.

His attack was so strong that the crowd began to exclaim. However, Lin Yun simply executed the Solaris Lunar attack to deal with the Imperial Diagram Realm Son. Practically in a split second, the nine dragons enveloping the Imperial Diagram Realm Son shattered along with the throne.

As the terrifying sword aura came crashing down, the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s holy spirit and armor shattered into pieces. Then, the fragments pierced his chest. At this moment, he was spitting up blood everywhere as he had to execute everything he had to shift the Flower Burial Sword two inches away from his heart.

There was no way he could resist this attack. With a sinister expression, the Imperial Diagram Realm Son grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword. As blood dripped down from his palm, the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s breathing became heavy, “Lin Yun, let me go. You still have the chance. Otherwise, there’s no way you can resist all those holy spirits. Even if you manage to kill me, you won’t be able to escape.”

As Lin Yun looked at the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s blood dripping down from the sword, he locked his brows together.

When the Imperial Diagram Realm Son saw this, he immediately rejoiced, “You’re hesitating. There’s no need to hesitate. Let me go and I promise that…”

But before he could finish, Lin Yun began to pour his origin energy into his sword. Then, he pulled it out while simultaneously leaving a crimson line on the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s neck. After that, the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s vitality began to slip away while he swiftly grabbed his throat. He was looking at Lin Yun with confusion and unwillingness.

“I wasn’t hesitating. I just couldn’t believe that you dirtied my sword with your hand,” said Lin Yun.

“You!” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son suddenly clenched his fist. But just when he was about to take a step forward, his neck exploded and his head was sent flying away. Just like that, the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s headless corpse collapsed to the ground. From this moment onwards, the Imperial Diagram Realm Son no longer existed.

The crowd couldn’t believe their eyes. The once invincible Realm Sons were no longer invincible with the death of the first Realm Son. The Realm Sons were once known as forbidden existences who couldn’t be provoked. This was the first time a Realm Son had ever died in the Heavenly Path.

In the next second, Lin Yun found himself in the situation that the Imperial Diagram Realm Son predicted. After Lin Yun unleashed his attack, the other Realm Sons came down hard on him with their holy spirits.

Everything took place quickly, so Lin Yun didn’t have the time to bring out his holy spirit or unleash his counterattack. In the end, his sword intent was suppressed by the Realm Sons.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun summoned his Azure Dragon Saint Armor as the Azure Dragon True Bone while his chest began to bloom brightly. Eighteen purple-golden dragon runes began to manifest on the surface of his body.

When the holy spirits charged over, they instantly shattered the eighteen dragons around Lin Yun and his armor was crushed. Additionally, his Azure Dragon Sword Aura was also crushed as he lost the origin energy to protect himself. The combined attacks from the Realm Sons even caused the Saint Spiritual Lake to start trembling violently. So many people in the surroundings were also caught up in the attack.

“Is it over?” Everyone was dumbfounded as they looked at this scene. Then again, they had predicted something like this would happen once Lin Yun challenged the Realm Sons. Although Lin Yun managed to suppress the Imperial Diagram Realm Son, he only dealt with one of ten Realm Sons.

When everything settled down, Lin Yun was covered with injuries. Additionally, his sword was nowhere to be seen. As for the Realm Sons, they were gasping for air. Logically speaking, Lin Yun should have died from their attacks. However, Lin Yun somehow managed to survive the ordeal. “He didn’t die?”

Although Lin Yun was covered with injuries and was greatly weakened, he was still alive. Right at this moment, the Imperial Feather Realm Son arrived above Lin Yun and looked down.

“Flower Burial, let me send you on your way.” The Imperial Feather Realm Son then reached out, grabbing Lin Yun and stabbing the latter’s chest. Instantly, the Imperial Feather Realm Son held a bone in his hand.

The bone was enveloped in a thunderstorm with a divine rune engraved on it. He had actually dug out Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone. It was a terrifying sight that made everyone shiver.
