Chapter 1319 - Bai Luli, I'm Here For Your Life (2)

“I said that you’ll regret it!” Bai Luli’s eyes flashed with madness while he gritted his teeth.

“This is the fellow that snatched the Dragon Blood Fruit? He doesn’t seem that impressive…” A silver-haired youth said while he looked at Lin Yun.

“I’ve seen many foolish people, but I’ve never seen someone so foolish to come and die.” The woman from the Flame Phoenix Sect said while she sat on a huge rock looking at Lin Yun. As transcendents, they didn’t even place Lin Yun in their eyes.

“This is a pretty huge formation,” said Lin Yun casually.

“Haha, what are you thinking about?” Bai Luli snickered. “This formation wasn’t prepared for you. I, alone, am enough to deal with you. If I wasn’t careless earlier, do you think I’d lose to you?!”

“It doesn’t matter because I’m here to kill you, either way,” replied Lin Yun.

“Hahaha!” His words sparked a wave of laughter amongst the seven of them before the woman from the Flame Phoenix Sect sneered, “Bai Luli, he says that he wants to kill you!”

“Looks like you have no idea what kind of position you’re in. But don’t worry, I won’t kill you so easily. You still have some value, but that will depend on luck and we’ll see if Flower Burial will show up. As for right now, you can kneel and beg me for forgiveness!” Bai Luli mocked before he turned into a flame dragon and charged forth. He was confident. At least, he was confident that the others would help if he couldn’t defeat Lin Yun.

“Lin Yun, I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time!” Bai Luli’s smile became sinister before he appeared before Lin Yun the next second with a painting unfolding behind him. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

That was his constellation, a volcano with a jiao-dragon above it. Today, he wanted to cleanse the humiliation he suffered and return it to Lin Yun a hundred-fold. With a loud explosion, the ground began to tremble violently, and the other transcendents lightly shook their heads, since they felt that Lin Yun was so weak that he wouldn’t even be able to summon his constellation before being suppressed by Bai Luli.

But what happened next left them dumbfounded. Lin Yun simply grabbed onto Bai Luli’s wrist. When their eyes squinted and before they could even respond, dragon runes appeared on the surface of Lin Yun’s body and he ripped Bai Luli’s arm off. As blood splashed out, Bai Luli, who was aloof just a moment ago, screamed out in pain.

“W-What’s going on?” The six transcendents were dumbfounded when they saw this scene.

“I said that I’m here to kill you.” Lin Yun looked at Bai Luli who was struggling on the ground.

Bai Luli’s face turned pale when he heard that, before his expression became sinister and yelled, “Q-Quick! Attack him and save me!”

The six transcendents then recovered from their shock and summoned their constellations before they dashed forth, creating various phenomena, and instantly arrived before Lin Yun.

“It’s futile, no matter who comes!” Lin Yun took a step forth and the dragon runes began to appear on the surface of his body before they manifested into an azure dragon that charged forth. At the same time, an immense dragon aura instantly enveloped this entire region, suppressing the constellations summoned by the six transcendents.

Taking a step forth, Lin Yun raised his hand and easily sent the woman from the Flame Phoenix Sect flying with a slap. But he didn’t end it there. He grabbed onto the throat of the silver-haired youth and tossed him away like a piece of garbage.

Since Lin Yun had powerful brute strength, the silver-haired youth flew out like a dragon before he collided against a hill, causing the entire hill to collapse.

Taking the fourth step, Lin Yun swung the back of his hands in both directions. Before two of the transcendent geniuses could get close, their ribs began to break, and they threw out blood when they fell to the ground.

Then, they were horrified to discover the spirituality in the eyes of the azure dragon and the aura it was giving off. They were comparable to a true dragon. As their constellations were restricted, the two of them couldn’t get back on their feet no matter how they struggled, and this discovery made their hearts sink into the abyss.

When Lin Yun took another step forth, a sword ray flew out and pieced the chest of another transcendent, pinning him to a hill. With that, only one of the six transcendent geniuses was left, and this transcendent genius was from the Myriad Beast Gate.

This transcendent genius was strong. Even with his constellation restricted, he had a powerful physique that enabled him to be fearless against Lin Yun’s dragon aura and sword intent. As a ferocious light flashed from his pupils, a torrential blood aura began to explode. At this moment, he was giving off the feeling of a demonic beast before he charged towards Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun casually took the seventh step out. As his hair fluttered in the wind, he merely turned back to glare at the Myriad Beast Gate’s transcendent genius with firmament sword intent focused in his pupils.

This instantly made the Myriad Beast Gate’s transcendent genius feel tiny when compared to a giant like Lin Yun. With just a glance, he was sent flying back with his eyes melting like magma, causing him to scream out in pain at the same time.

This scene made everyone feel their scalps going numb, and their souls were trembling with fear at this moment. Lin Yun had merely taken seven steps out, and this made transcendent geniuses like them turn into a joke before Lin Yun. At the same time, they were inwardly screaming about what kind of monster Lin Yun was to suppress the seven of them so easily!

“Bai Luli, I’m here for your life.” Lin Yun calmly said with his gaze falling onto Bai Luli.

Bai Luli was long terrified, and his mind was blank because he couldn’t figure out what kind of monster he got himself involved with. But he soon recovered from his shock before he begged for his life while sobbing, “Y-You can’t kill me.”

“Stop!” At the same time, the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts finally couldn’t watch anymore and let out a roar with their faces turning black. Their voices contained boundless astral energy and torrential rage.

In their eyes, Lin Yun should’ve been a nobody that the transcendent geniuses of their sects could easily suppress. But who would have imagined that all of them were on the ground so quickly? At the same time, they knew that Lin Yun was someone of an entirely different caliber.

When the eight greater Elysium Core Realm experts let out their roars, their voices combined together and instantly tore apart the first and second layer of the thirty-sixth layers of heaven. They had completely panicked at this moment and even fused their martial intent into their voices.

Their voices spread across ten thousand miles, and countless people threw out a mouthful of blood because of the shockwave from their voices. When someone raised their heads, they were completely dumbfounded to see eight figures radiating brightly in the sky. They wielded saint artifacts like colossal mountains crashing down.

This made everyone begin to wonder what was going on in the Silversnow Mountain Range to make the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts so furious. The shockwave from their voices even caused everything within a myriad mile to tremble.

Bai Luli was rejoicing that he was saved when he saw the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts standing out. But just when he was about to speak, Lin Yun dragged him over with a wave of his hand. “I said that no one can save you.”

Clenching his fist, the azure dragon in the sky returned to his body and gathered towards his fist. When he threw out his punch, it was radiating as brightly as a blazing sun.

When his boundless energy poured into Bai Luli’s body, every single one of his cells began to shine with a purple and golden light. In the next second, Bai Luli’s body suddenly exploded and he was reduced to ashes. Lin Yun did this before the eight greater Elysium Core Realm experts.
