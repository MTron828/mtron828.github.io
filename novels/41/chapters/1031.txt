Chapter 1032 - Regain Conscious

Four Phase City was situated in the core of the Heavenly Path and was the last checkpoint for everyone in the Heavenly Path. Naturally, the city was packed with geniuses from all four regions, regardless if they wanted to continue or not.

It was unbelievably massive because it was remodeled from an ancient dragon city, so it housed many powerful sects. Although the environment was chaotic from the amount of people, no one dared to kill in the city.

Explosive news was constantly spread throughout the city. After all, there were countless people who showed up out of nowhere in the Heavenly Path. With ancient inheritances being discovered, it was only natural that geniuses showed up out of nowhere. However, not even the new geniuses dared to act arrogantly in Four Phase City.

Many people who were in the city were on the ranking. There were also many nameless people appearing with the Heavenly Path coming to an end. No one was surprised anymore by the names that were constantly changing.

Since there were only two months left in the Heavenly Path, the low profile geniuses didn’t stay hidden anymore. Four Phase City had no lack of geniuses, so it was always busy. But recently, the city gradually became intense since those from the Yellow Sandy Plain entered the city.

The newcomers also brought along unbelievable news that sent the whole city in an uproar. The generals from the Elysium Trigram, Nether Divinity, and Profound Dragon War Realms were all slaughtered. No one could understand what had happened.

After all, the Ten War Realms were godly existences that no one dared to provoke. They were mysterious and powerful, which helped them find various opportunities in the forbidden regions. But now, their reputation was destroyed.

“Flower Burial? Is he really that strong?”

“I heard about him a long time ago. He’s a genius in the way of the sword who appeared in the Azure Dragon Region. I also heard that he obtained the opportunity above fortune in the Azure Dragon Palace. I simply can’t imagine how strong he is…”

“He’s terrifyingly strong. If he wasn’t, he would dare to provoke three war realms on his own.” The news spread like wildfire in Four Phase City. Lin Yun wasn’t a nameless person, so his reputation was already well known. Although the news was shocking, only a few people doubted it.

Now, Lin Yun was considered a true genius. Then again, there were naturally those who were unhappy about it, especially the newly risen geniuses in Four Phase City. All of them had extraordinary opportunities, so they believed that they were the best over Lin Yun.

All of these geniuses were planning to make a move at the final battle to defeat the geniuses of the war realms. It would be a shocking display of power and strength. But who would have thought that Lin Yun would beat them to the punch?

In just one night, Lin Yun’s name was known by everyone in Four Phase City. Even after two days, there weren’t any signs of the conversations slowing down. A lot of people were talking about Lin Yun and speculating what would happen next.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. In a massive courtyard located in Four Phase City was a secluded space that cost a lot of astral pellets. It was so safe that no one outside of the courtyard could sense what was going on. To those who wanted to make a breakthrough or practice powerful martial techniques, this was the perfect place.

In one of the rooms located in the courtyard, Lin Yun slowly opened his eyes. Removing the quilt covering him, Lin Yun looked around and frowned, “Where am I?”

The last thing he remembered was standing outside the city. He examined the surroundings and determined that he was in a safe place. He basically recovered from his injuries and even reached the pinnacle third soul Heavenly Soul Realm while he was unconscious.

Lin Yun pondered briefly before he realized what happened. With a bitter smile, Lin Yun wondered, “How many herbs did it take?”

Lil’ Red and Pei Xue probably fed him herbs and treasures while he was unconscious. When he tried moving, his heart began to beat powerfully while boundless vitality poured out. He wore a bitter smile at this scene.

Luckily, he had cultivated a powerful physique through the Azure Dragon Saint Art. Otherwise, he would have lost his life. He had recovered from a majority of his wounds and only the poison from the Ancient Demon Seal Array remained. It wasn’t fatal, but it was annoying like he had a fishbone in his throat.

It would take him a while before he removed it. Fortunately, the head generals weren’t strong or else he would have lost his life to the Ancient Demon Soul Array. If that happened, poison would have been the least of his problems.

“The foundation of the war realms is really terrifying,” muttered Lin Yun. His smile was slowly replaced with a grave expression.

Suddenly, the door opened as Pei Xue walked in. When Pei Xue saw Lin Yun, she was stunned before she rejoiced, “Pig, you’re up!”

“It’s been three days.” Pei Xue came over to help Lin Yun, but she moved back to the table when she suddenly thought of something.

Lin Yun casually sat down and fell silent. A while later, Lin Yun placed the cup down and looked at Pei Xue, “Thank you for taking care of me for the past three days. But I believe you have some things to tell me, right?”

Pei Xue was surprised but she wasn’t shocked. She knew that Lin Yun would inquire about Yue Weiwei. “The reason why I didn’t tell you about Yue Weiwei back then is because I didn’t want to involve you with the war realms. But since you’ve already come this far, I will tell you everything I know.”

“Thank you,” replied Lin Yun.

“You!” Pei Xue glared at Lin Yun with unhappiness in her eyes before she shorted, “Hmph, I won’t make a big deal about it. Many people are looking for the Divine Blood Fruit in the Heavenly Path, but there are only three of them. That lover of yours wanted all three of them, so she injured me.

“She has a terrifying origin and many war realms suffered at her hands. Among those who suffered are the Elysium Trigram, Nether Divinity, and Profound Dragon War Realms. They are also the ones who have the deepest grudge with her. The Divine Blood Fruit she has right now is the one she stole from them. But someone had laid a trap for her during the battle, so she’s been facing the pursuit of the three war realms.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that because he had a rough sense of the situation before.

“What did the head generals mean back then?” Lin Yun asked. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“It’s weird. We both come from Kunlun Realm, so I know she has an extraordinary origin. Although she fell into a trap, she shouldn’t fall into the hands of just three war realms,” replied Pei Xue. She had a guess, but she couldn’t tell Lin Yun. She tried to soften the blow and comfort him, “She should be safe. If the war realms obtained the Divine Blood Fruit, they wouldn’t be targeting me.”

Although Lin Yun was relieved when he heard that, he still had a shadow looming in his heart. He couldn’t feel at ease unless he saw Yue Weiwei.

“What exactly is the Divine Blood Fruit?” Lin Yun asked because everything revolved around it.

Pei Xue hesitated briefly before she replied, “It’s fine to tell you since it’s useless to geniuses in the Heavenly Path. It’s a treasure that the supreme experts need. In the past, there was a god war in the Heavenly Path. Along with the war, there were many powerful dao rhymes. However, we can’t comprehend them with our current cultivation.”

“The fruit itself has tons of magical uses such as longevity and breakthrough. It’s extremely rare in Kunlun Realm and can only be found in forbidden regions. But not even the supreme experts dare to take a step in the forbidden regions. Do you understand what’s going on now?”

Lin Yun finally understood what the Divine Blood Fruit was, but its purpose was out of reach for him. But to a supreme expert, it was a treasure.
