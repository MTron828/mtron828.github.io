Chapter 864 - Quota Determined

The teleportation array at the top of the mountain started to light up with Lin Yun and Yan Mo’s battle coming to an end.

“Are they coming out?” Everyone was curious to see who would be the first to exit the test. They were certain that it wouldn’t be Lin Yun because Lin Yun and Yan Mo were probably still fighting. After all, the screen turned off after Yan Mo hit the ceiling.

As the teleportation array lit up, Fang Shaoyu of the Profound Domain walked out. Upon seeing Fang Shaoyu, everyone fell into a brief silence before Gao Zhangtian rejoiced. Gao Zhangtian wasn’t surprised because Fang Shaoyu was strong to begin with, not to mention that he didn’t run into Lin Yun or Yan Mo. So how could he not obtain the quota?

The focus was on the remaining quotas. Lin Yun killed Zhong Xuan before running into Yan Mo, so there were more variables and uncertainty in the tests. When the teleportation array lit up once more, another person came out. This time, it was Zhao Chen, the champion of the Mound Northern Domain. He normally kept a low profile, so it was a surprise that he obtained the quota. It brought joy to the Sacred Alliance elder of the Mound Northern Domain.

Shortly after, the Mountain Western Domain and Gauze Eastern Domain also had fighters who obtained a quota. This meant that four out of five domains had obtained a quota. Qing Tu looked at everyone’s expression with depression on his face because no one from the Ancient Southern Domain had a quota yet. He also had no idea if Lin Yun would beat Yan Mo. All he could do was wait.

“Hehe, Lin Yun is unbelievably strong, but the others from the Ancient Southern Domain are really weak. It looks like no one else could obtain a quota.” The black-clothed middle-aged man from the Gauze Eastern Domain chuckled when he looked at Qing Tu. The middle-aged man was named Lei Chi and he was a powerful demonic cultivator before he joined the Sacred Alliance.

Since Lin Yun beat up Yan Mo in the test, there was a high possibility that Lin Yun would be the victor. So Lei Chi was unhappy and tried to poke at the Ancient Southern Domain’s elder.

Qing Tu wore an awkward expression, but he wasn’t in a position to refute Lei Chi.

When Gao Zhangtian saw this scene, his eyes flickered as he smiled, “Elder Lei, I heard that you had a friendship with Yan Mo’s clan before joining the Sacred Alliance. Since you’ve joined the Sacred Alliance, you have to stay neutral.”

Although Gao Zhangitan was smiling, he was warning Lei Chi. The warning served as a reminder for Lei Chi to remember his identity and also to alleviate Qing Tu’s awkward feeling.

“Haha, I’m just speaking the truth.” Lei Chi smiled. “There really isn’t anyone impressive from the Ancient Southern Domain. If Lin Yun is killed by Yan Mo, then no one from the Ancient Southern Domain will make it out.”

“Lei Chi, don’t take it too far!” roared Qing Tu.

“Hehe, did I? Don’t try to suppress me with Boss Gao. I’m just speaking the truth,” sneered Lei Chi. The other Sacred Alliance elders saw this scene, but they didn’t say anything. After all, they might be from the Sacred Alliance, but they represented their own domains. Naturally, there was a sense of competition between everyone.

Gao Zhangtian frowned because there was nothing he could do to Lei Chi. After all, Lei Chi was speaking the truth. Right at this moment, a figure appeared from the teleportation array. The figure wore black clothes and had half of a devil mask. He was naturally Ancient Southern Domain’s Zhu Qingshan!

“Someone from the Ancient Southern Domain!” Everyone was shocked because they never expected someone besides Lin Yun to obtain a quota. When Lei Chi saw this, he was surprised and then his face turned nasty.

“Haha. Congratulations, Elder Qing Tu. The Ancient Southern Domain has finally obtained a quota.” The others were briefly stunned, but they started to congratulate Qing Tu. This meant that even if Lin Yun lost to Yan Mo, someone from the Ancient Southern Domain would still make it out.

When Zhu Qingshan came out, more people started to appear. The next to appear was Yue Weiwei. However, the shock didn’t end there as Yu Haotian immediately followed her out of the teleportation array.

“Another genius from the Ancient Southern Domain!”

“Holy shit, there are only eight quotas and the Ancient Southern Domain has obtained three!”

“How terrifying! They even surpassed the Profound Domain!” Lei Chi and Gao Zhangtian’s facial expressions became a little peculiar when they saw this.

The joyous moment came a little too quickly for Qing Tu so he was stunned. However, once he registered what happened, he started to tremble with excitement. When he looked at Yu Haotian, his thoughts became complex. He was surprised that Yu Haotian obtained a quota and became worried for Lin Yun. If Lin Yun couldn’t obtain a quota, then his reputation in the Ancient Southern Domain would go down the drain.

“Big Brother Yun hasn’t come out?” Yue Weiwei asked Jiang Ziye and the others when she didn’t see Lin Yun anywhere.

Jiang Ziye wore a grave expression and said, “He ran into Yan Mo. Their fight was so intense that it destroyed the screen. We have no idea what’s going on inside anymore. However, just before the screen was destroyed, Lin Yun had obtained the advantage in the fight as Yan Mo was heavily injured.”

“I heard from some of the Sacred Alliance’s elders that this is some battle of fate,” said Mu Han.

“Battle of fate?” Yue Weiwei frowned as she began to question what was going on. Mu Han then explained the battle of fate to Yue Weiwei, which made her face turn grave. Then, she turned to look at Yu Haotian and fell into deep thoughts.

She knew that what they said was more or less the truth. Lin Yun was linked to the Sword Sect’s karma. As the voices at the top of the mountain gradually calmed down, everyone anxiously looked at the teleportation array. The last quota was down to Lin Yun and Yan Mo.

The fact that they hadn’t come out yet meant that the battle was intense. There was even a high possibility that one of them would die since the battle was related to the Ancient Southern Domain’s fate.

“I wonder who will win.”

“Probably Lin Yun. After all, he held the advantage in the fight.”

“It’s hard to say. Yan Mo’s massacre intent is extremely weird since he can devour his own blood to strengthen himself.” While everyone discussed their opinions, the teleportation array lit up and a powerful origin energy fluctuation spread out. In the next moment, a familiar figure came out of the teleportation array while emitting a powerful massacre intent. The figures clothes were dyed with blood, but there was no mistake that it was the Gauze Eastern Domain’s Yan Mo.

“Yan Mo won!”

“Wait, something doesn’t seem right…” The Gauze Eastern Domain’s geniuses rejoiced briefly before they became stunned. Yan Mo didn’t walk down, but instead went flying. When he flew in the sky, he vomited blood as countless sword rays exploded from within his body.

Under everyone’s gazes, Yan Mo’s body was torn into pieces by the violent sword intent. Shortly after, the remains of Yan Mo’s corpse were reduced to dust.

“H-how is this possible?!”

“Yan Mo actually died?!”

“What just happened?” Exclamations were heard everywhere because no one had expected this scene. Lei Chi was also stunned because he didn’t expect this outcome. Even though he thought that Yan Mo was going to lose or die, he didn’t expect Yan Mo to die in such a terrifying manner. Lin Yun might seem gentle, but he was a ruthless person. Only a ruthless person would make another cultivator disintegrate into dust.

At this moment, the teleportation array lit up as a person donned in azure clothes carrying a sword box walked out.

“The last quota should go to me, right?” Lin Yun frowned while looking at the surrounding gazes. Yan Mo ruthlessly used a forbidden technique to devour his own blood to strengthen himself. Even if Yan Mo won, he would have crippled himself. Facing such a ruthless person, Lin Yun had no choice but to kill him.

“Who else if it’s not you?” Gao Zhangtian smiled. “I believe Elder Lei has no objections.”

Lei Chi’s face turned red and white because he knew that Gao Zhangtian was humiliating him on purpose.

“I don’t have any objections,” said Lei Chi with his teeth gnashed. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When Lin Yun looked around, he saw that the faces of Gauze Eastern Domain’s geniuses were ugly. But it had nothing to do with him since he had obtained the quota.

Looking around, Gao Zhangtian said, “Fang Shaoyu, Lin Yun, Zhao Chen…Yu Haotian, congratulations for obtaining the quota to the Heavenly Path. As for the rest, I’m sorry to say that all of you are eliminated. If you want, you can stay on the Profound Amber Mountain to cultivate. In the future, you might also have the opportunity to head to Kunlun Realm. However, you won’t be able to go through the Heavenly Path and get recruited by the powerful sects.”

Gao Zhangtian tried to be tactful with his words, but no one would feel good about missing an opportunity to join the powerful sects. These geniuses had been at the center of attention in the Profound Amber Realm, but they would be the lowest of the low in the Kunlun Realm. They naturally felt terrible about that sort of future.

Many people hesitated before they gave up. After all, they would rather be at the top of the totem pole rather than the bottom of the totem pole. However, no one from the Ancient Southern Domain gave up because they were determined.

“Alright, you guys can go down the mountain to rest for now. In the future, you can stay at the Profound Amber Mountain. As for the eight of you…” Gao Zhangtian swept his glance at Lin Yun before he spoke with a grave, “You will represent the Profound Amber Realm and compete with the other realms. You guys don’t have to go down since you’ll be leaving soon. Tomorrow night, you all will travel on the Heavenly Path.”

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as those words caused a fluctuation in his heart. The Heavenly Path was finally starting.
