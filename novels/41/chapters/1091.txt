Chapter 1092 - Style

Lin Yun had a total of 80,000 Divine Astral Pellets, 30 True Dragon Saint Liquid, 40 Blood Flame Pellets, seven Nirvana Pellets, and many other treasures. It was an enormous sum of wealth that he got from the Realm Sons. Now, his wealth far exceeded the core disciples in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“There aren’t any other Divine Blood Fruits.” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. Then again, the Imperial Feather Realm Son might’ve sealed the Divine Blood Fruit in his body like Pei Xue. Either way, Lin Yun still had the best Divine Blood Fruit with seven leaves.

As for the herbs and beast cores, Lin Yun gave them all to Lil’ Red, which was enough for Lil’ Red to reach the Empyrean Realm.

Lin Yun began to toy with the jade flute given to him by Yue Weiwei. The jade flute had eight holes and was slightly longer than one meter. He could tell that it wasn’t ordinary with just a glance as it had an ornament hanging on its end.

“That jade flute is pretty good. I think it was made with Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo. It’s pretty rare in Kunlun Realm because the bamboo only grows by one segment every 10,000 years. With each segment that it grows, it needs to go through 999 tribulations. It’s really lavish to make it into a flute. In terms of the base material, it’s practically the same as the Nine Divine Phoenix Zither in the past.” Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded out in his mind.

“The Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo?” Lin Yun held onto the jade flute. He didn’t expect that this jade flute would have such a huge origin.

“Hmph, I bet you don’t know about it, right?” Lil’ Purple wore a smug face and continued, “The origin of the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo is huge. You have to learn music since you’re cultivating the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. This flute will save you some effort.”

“Weren’t you angry just a moment ago?” Lin Yun said with a playful smile.

“Hmph, I’m not going to stoop down to your level.” Lil’ Purple pouted her lips and folded her arms.

Suddenly, Lil’ Red opened its eyes and raised its head, which drew Lin Yun’s attention. Right at this moment, Feng Jue had pushed the doors open and walked in with his boundless sword intent on blowing toward Lin Yun.

But because of the smile on Feng Jue’s face, the sword intent that was about to devour Lin Yun suddenly disappeared. This made Lin Yun surprised because he could sense the fourth-grade sword intent from Feng Jue, which was also in complete mastery. If it wasn’t so strong, Lin Yun wouldn’t have felt his sword intent get suppressed.

“I’m done.” Feng Jue smiled, “Three days later, the sect master will announce you as the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s core disciple with a chance to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain. This is all senior brother can do for you. You’ll have to depend on yourself for the rest of the next year.”

Many core disciples were in the Empyrean Realm, and the Sword Saint Mountain was a place that only the best of the best could ascend.

“I’m not qualified right now, and it’ll draw unwanted attention,” said Lin Yun.

“Oh?” Feng Jue wore a playful expression and smiled, “I’m surprised to hear that from you. After all, this is so unlike your style in the Heavenly Path.”

Feng Jue was trying to dig a hole for Lin Yun. After all, many people had their eyes on him. He was an outsider whose cultivation was only in the Heavenly Soul Realm, which attracted a lot of unwanted attention.

“If you think I’m putting you in a difficult position, then I can call it off for you,” said Feng Jue.

“That’s not my style,” replied Lin Yun.

“Hehe, that’s right. Have fun here then!” Feng Jue revealed a cunning smile because he wanted to see how Senior Brother Wang Jue would deal with this prideful junior brother of his. But it was a pity that this was the Profound Azure Manor, and he couldn’t stay here for long.

“Hmph, this old geezer is evil. Lin Yun, don’t believe him.” Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded out.

“I’ll be leaving if there’s nothing else. I’ll come back a year from now to pick you up,” said Feng Jue. He would be back in a year, but if Lin Yun couldn’t get through the test, then his master wouldn’t be able to take Lin Yun as a disciple.

“You’re really in a hurry. I believe you’ve forgotten about my meeting gift,” smiled Lin Yun.

Seeing that Lin Yun was asking for a gift, Feng Jue began to curse inwardly because he did it on purpose. After all, Lin Yun had too many treasures, and if his treasures weren't up to par, then it would make him look petty. However, if he gave something too good, he would feel heartache. The best method was to gloss over the meeting gift.

Feng Jue would have gotten away with his plan if Lin Yun didn’t ask for it. Revealing an amicable smile, Feng Jue said, “I almost forgot about that. Junior brother, what do you want? Uh, let me be more specific. I believe you’re not lacking in terms of pellets or treasures. How about this, I’ll give you a secret artifact. Do you want one to protect yourself or kill your enemy?”

“Safety comes first,” said Lin Yun honestly.

At this moment, Feng Jue really wanted to give himself a slap and smiled, “Alright, I happen to have a secret artifact for protection. It can conceal your existence and engrave a rune on both your hearts. Unless it’s a Samsara Edict Realm expert, no one can pierce through your forehead and heart at the same time.”

The two hearts represented the forehead and heart, the two fatal spots on a person’s body. Lin Yun didn’t have a clear understanding of the Samsara Edict Realm, but Luo Qingxu of the Sacred Alliance was one. Even someone as powerful as Elder Jin Jue couldn’t put up any resistance against that realm.

Feng Jue’s heart bled as he took out a mask that could cover half of his face. The surface was smooth and it looked like a silver mirror.

“This mask is called Silver Moon!” Feng Jue explained while placing the mask on his face. As silver moonlight radiated, his hair, eyes, and clothes instantly turned silver. Even his aura had undergone a drastic transformation, making him seem like a completely different person than before. At the same time, silver moon runes bloomed on his chest and slowly engraved themselves into his heart.

“Aside from protecting yourself and concealing your identity, it can also create the phenomenon of a full moon. When the phenomenon blooms, it’ll cover a radius of a thousand miles. It’s tough for anyone to escape the phenomenon once they are caught,” said Feng Jue. At this moment, even his voice had changed.

Lin Yun was surprised because the treasure really changed Feng Jue’s identity. If Lin Yun hadn’t witnessed it personally, he wouldn’t believe that this was Feng Jue.

Removing the mask, Feng Jue’s appearance turned back to normal. “I never used this ever since I got it. It’s rare among saint artifacts, and it’s only produced by the Mo Clan. There’s only one of these in the world.”

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that. Was it the same Mo Clan that produced the Millennium Flame?

“Senior Brother, this meeting gift is a little too much.” Lin Yun said with a grave expression because he never expected that Feng Jue would give him a saint artifact.

Seeing that Lin Yun was tactful, Feng Jue rejoiced inwardly. Since Lin Yun didn’t want it, then he could save it for himself. But right at this moment, Lin Yun took the mask over and praised, “Thank you. I really like this gift.”

Seeing this scene, Feng Jue nearly went insane but he still squeezed out a smile, “It’s just a small gift. I’ll make a breakthrough soon, so this item will be useless for me.”

As he looked at Lin Yun, he comforted himself that it wasn’t a huge gift. But when he left, he was sobbing inwardly. He was determined not to boast again in the future because he nearly lost his position to his junior brother.

“Senior brother actually gave me a saint artifact!” Lin Yun rejoiced while he looked at the mask with disbelief. After all, it was a saint artifact crafted by the Mo Clan, not to mention that there was only one of these in the world. Now, even a king also wouldn’t be able to shatter his two hearts. After he was done, Lin Yun said, “Lil’ Purple, you’re not allowed to speak badly of senior brother in the future.”

“That old geezer must be faking it. I can tell with just one glance,” said Lil’ Purple confidently.

“Faking it? This is a great price for faking it. After all, it’s a unique saint artifact from the Mo Clan,” replied Lin Yun with disbelief. After all, this was a saint artifact that even he wouldn’t give it out. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Hmph, there’s nothing impressive about it…” Lil’ Purple muttered. Even she had to admit that a treasure from the Mo Clan was precious as she had drank the wine made by the Mo Clan in the past. In ancient times, the Mo Clan was extremely famous.

With the Indigo Jade Flute, Flower Burial Sword, and Silver Moon, Lin Yun could now have a secret identity in Kunlun Realm. Storing the mask, Lin Yun became concerned with the troubles that he would face in three days.

Three days was enough for Lin Yun to digest all of his insights from the Heavenly Path while simultaneously reaching the sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Since Feng Jue had given him such a huge gift, he naturally couldn’t embarrass himself.

Only those who were qualified would draw the jealousy of others. So it was time to see who was jealous of him. Lin Yun’s eyes began to flash when he thought about the next few days.
