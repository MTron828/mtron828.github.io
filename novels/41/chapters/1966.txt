Chapter 1967 - Cowering (1)

Lin Yun was baffled about why he was brought to Nether Orchid Mountain. Doesn’t the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint reside in the Solar Jade Palace?

“Go down!” Bai Shuying grabbed his hand, and dove down while Lin Yun was confused. Lin Yun’s robe was violently fluttering from the wind.

The scenery below gradually became apparent when the clouds split like a curtain. Lin Yun discovered that Nether Orchid Mountain was more significant than he had imagined, with countless peaks and palaces.

Bai Shuying brought Lin Yun to the palaces at the waist of the mountain, and they landed on a spacious plaza. There were many palaces on the surrounding peaks, and each palace was elegantly decorated. Peaks surrounded the plaza, and the tops of the peaks were filled with palaces.

Bai Shuying said, “This is Dustless Plaza, a forbidden ground within the Nether Orchid Courtyard. This place is open for guests from various holy lands and discussions of important matters. The surrounding area is the Thirteen Nether Orchid Peaks and Thirteen Dustless Palaces. You can pick a peak to stay on, and each peak is connected to the saint vein. A day of cultivation is equivalent to a month in the outside world.”

“What’s this about?” Lin Yun asked.

When Bai Shuying turned around, sunlight shone down on her. Lin Yun was briefly stunned, looking at her. He had never noticed that she had such gorgeous eyes in the past. Her eyes were as bright as shining stars.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Bai Shuying didn’t reply and said, “My master will tell you when she’s here.”

The moment she said that, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint descended from the sky and landed on Dustless Plaza.

“Ye Qingtian!” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said as she landed on the mat. A stone table made of jade was in front of her, and she signaled Lin Yun to sit in front of her.

“There isn’t anyone else?” Lin Yun curiously asked as he looked around.

“No one else,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. “I will personally guide you in sword techniques.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned and couldn’t believe what she said.

“What’s the matter? Are you looking down on me because you’re the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s secluded disciple?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said as the surrounding temperature fell with a terrifying chill spreading out.

“I don’t dare to look down on you,” Lin Yun said. But despite saying that, he was feeling suspicious within his heart. After all, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint wasn’t polite to him yesterday, so why did her attitude change so much today?

“You’ll stay here from now on,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

Lin Yun was inwardly alarmed upon hearing that, and his face changed. He asked, “For how long?”

“I have the final say in that.”

Lin Yun’s face changed. It was naturally a rare opportunity for him to learn from the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, but he didn’t know much about her. So how could he accept being forced to stay here when he had so many secrets? At the very least, using the Three-Lives Fruit here wouldn’t be convenient, and he needed time to finish using all the time within it.

“Can I discuss it with my master?” Lin Yun refused.

“Your master has already left,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“What?” Lin Yun’s face changed because it was too sudden. Didn’t the Dragon Origin Great Saint say he wanted to research the Azure Dragon Divine Physique? So why did he suddenly leave without informing him?

“Oh? It looks like you didn’t know that. It looks like Long Yun doesn’t care about his secluded disciple after all,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint smiled.

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled upon hearing that. He said, “Then, I have to discuss this with the Azure River Sword Saint.”

“Now that you mentioned it, I have been looking for him for a while, and yet he’s been hiding from me. Why don’t you get him to come to the Nether Orchid Courtyard? I happen to have something to ask him,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said with a playful smile.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitched. Even his senior brother ran?

“I haven’t completed my duty as a saint disciple, and I’m afraid I can’t stay here long.” Lin Yun could only bite the bullet and think of another reason.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint fell into silence. When Lin Yun thought she would let him go, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, ‘Ye Qingtian, you better stay here. As for your duty as a saint disciple, I will get Shuying to accompany you. If you went alone, you wouldn’t know how you’ll die.”

Lin Yun was stunned by the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s words, refusing to believe what she said.

“You don’t believe me?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint sneered, “That ancestor of your Ye Clan is notorious for being narrow-minded. He places great importance on those who are of direct descendant, but if anyone from the concubine lineage threatens Ye Feng, they won’t even know how they died. Even the Dao Yang Palace Master has parted ways with him. So do you think you’ll survive if you go out? Or are you considering something as unrealistic as getting Ye Guhan to follow you?”

Lin Yun fell into silence after hearing that. He didn’t expect that the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign was such a ruthless person.

“Ye Qingtian, how many people dream of receiving my master’s guidance? Why are you still pushing back and forth? Are you looking down on my Heavenly Jade’s lineage?” Bai Shuying furrowed her brows upon hearing Lin Yun’s excuses. Her master was the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, so she naturally became furious after seeing how unwilling Ye Qingtian was acting.

“Shuying, don’t be rude,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. “Ye Qingtian has a prestigious background, and I’m not surprised my Heavenly Jade’s lineage can’t enter his eyes.”

Lin Yun could naturally hear the sarcasm within her tone, and something didn’t feel right. He felt that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint wasn’t referring to the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

“Ye Qingtian, we can have a spar if you’re unconvinced. I’ll limit my cultivation to the Profound Death Stage and you’ll cut the nonsense if you lose,” Bai Shuying said, looking at Lin Yun.

“That’s a good idea. Ye Qingtian, what do you think of Shuying’s suggestion?” Surprisingly, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint didn’t stop Bai Shuying and even agreed.

Lin Yun began to wonder if his master, the Radiant Sword Saint, bullied the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint in the past. He felt that he was suffering on behalf of his master, and it was too apparent that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was targeting him.

But it made no sense because his identity shouldn’t have been revealed. Since she mentioned that she wanted him to invite Azure River Sword Saint over, this meant that she wasn’t sure of his identity herself.

“Ye Qingtian, are you willing?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked.

But Lin Yun replied with a smile, “There’s no need for that. I have no intention of looking down on Heavenly Jade’s lineage. I only have respect for the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden, and I agree with you guiding me. I will stay here to practice sword techniques in the future, and Martial Aunt can decide how long I’ll stay here.”

Bai Shuying raised her brow with a flash of pity within her pupils. Ye Qingtian was too cunning and didn’t even have the slightest courage.
