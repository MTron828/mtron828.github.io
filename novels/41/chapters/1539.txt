Chapter 1540 - Mu Xuankong's Rage

Black Tortoise Breathing, Divine Tortoise Transformation? Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, and this instantly piqued his interest, “It’s great if I can perfectly conceal my aura.”

“The Black Tortoise Breathing is a breathing technique, but it’s more profound than ordinary Tortoise Breathing. As for the Divine Tortoise Transformation, this is a dragon spirit cultivation technique related to one of the four divine beasts, the black tortoise. Upon reaching a certain realm, not only can you change your aura, but you can also change your appearance. This is a profound transforming technique,” smiled Mu Chuan.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

When it comes to Elysium Core Realm cultivators, they could easily change their appearance, even if they didn’t practice any transforming techniques. It was even more apparent for Lin Yun, who had practiced a body-refining technique. He could control his skeleton and change his height as he wished.

But this method didn’t have much meaning because powerful cultivators could see through the transformation with a glance. Just changing one’s appearance wasn’t impressive, but it was impressive if one could change their appearance and not let anyone see through it. At the very least, Lin Yun could rely on his Firmament Sword Intent to see through the physical body, just like how he sees through the flaws of his opponents’ martial techniques.

“The Divine Tortoise Transformation is a formidable transforming technique. There are rumors that if you can grasp the profundity, even saints won’t be able to see through your disguise!” Mu Chuan said.

“Isn’t that a little too heaven-defying?” Lin Yun was shocked. After all, it was a little ridiculous that not even saints could see through the disguise. “Senior Brother, have you reached that level?”

“Me?” Mu Chuan smiled. “I have no interest in it. So I didn’t waste much time on it and lacked a little comprehension. Most importantly, you need a blood essence of a saint demonic beast if you want to reach that level, and it has to be a demonic beast with the bloodline of the black tortoise.”

When Lin Yun heard that, the flames within his pupils calmed down; he already expected that such a heaven-defying technique required a high threshold. Saint demonic beasts were tough to deal with, to begin with. Not to mention that it has to be one possessing the bloodline of the divine beast, a black tortoise. Who in their right mind would offend such a powerful demonic beast?

“Alright. I’ll teach you the Black Tortoise Breathing. The threshold shouldn’t be difficult for you.” Seeing Lin Yun being so emotional, Mu Chuan recovered from his sorrow. The reason why he and their master wasn’t willing to tell Lin Yun about Jian Jingtian’s story was that they were afraid Lin Yun couldn’t accept it.

After all, Lin Yun was still young, and it was pretty good that he could divert his attention with the Black Tortoise Breathing. It’s just that Mu Chuan didn’t know that Jian Jingtian’s story was deeply imprinted within Lin Yun’s heart. He didn’t say anything, but it was deeply engraved within his heart.

Half an hour later, Lin Yun had already grasped the Black Tortoise Breathing, and his emotions had calmed down. His aura was like a sleeping tortoise sinking into a particular stagnant stage. Even the stars within his violet palace had dimmed down.

Simultaneously, Lin Yun was shocked to discover that after circulating the Black Tortoise Breathing, his exhaustion was practically nonexistent. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he felt like he was an ordinary Elysium Core Realm cultivator.

“Very good. No one can see through you if you don’t reveal your strength. Even Samsara Edict Realm experts will have to put in more effort to see through you. But ordinary Samsara Edict Realm experts won’t pay much attention to you.” Mu Chuan said, and he was inwardly shocked. Lin Yun had only spent half an hour to grasp it, which was enough to prove that he had a shocking comprehension.

“I feel that if I cultivate it daily, it will transform. It feels like a longevity technique.” Lin Yun shared.

“Is that so? I didn’t notice that. I’ll transmit the Divine Tortoise Transformation to you, and you can comprehend it when you’re free.” Mu Chaun took out a tortoise shell from his interspatial bracelet. The tortoise shell had many words engraved on it, making it look profound.

“I already looked into the tortoise shell for some time. So you can have it.” Mu Chuan tossed the tortoiseshell to Lin Yun.

“Thank you, Senior Brother.” Lin Yun rejoiced. After learning the Black Tortoise Breathing, Lin Yun’s interest in the Divine Tortoise Transformation increased significantly.

Three days later, they made it back to the Sword Sect. Mu Chuan carried Feng Jue and went to see Mu Xuankong, while Lin Yun returned to the Cloud Soaring Peak.

When Mu Xuankong saw Mu Chuan, he tossed a letter over.

“Who wrote it?”

“Tian Xuanzi.”

Mu Chuan raised his brow and snickered after receiving the letter, “So he’s both the good and bad person?”

Tian Xuanzi addressed that Jin Jue was no longer an elder of the Profound Sky Sect three months ago, and his actions had nothing to do with the sect. He was only a member of the Nether Divinity Clan now. So if the Sword Sect was unhappy, the Sword Sect could go and look for the Nether Divinity Clan. He wouldn’t interfere in that, which was more or less the story's content.

Tian Xuanzi had received information about Jin Jue’s actions along ago and was clearly turning a blind eye on purpose. If Jin Jue could kill Lin Yun, it would definitely be the best. If Jin Jue couldn’t, it had nothing to do with the Profound Sky Sect, and there was nothing the Sword Sect could do. Most importantly, Lin Yun killed the Nether Divinity Clan’s realm son, and there was nothing the Sword Sect could do about it.

“We’re careless in this matter,” said Mu Xuankong. “Who could’ve thought that my medal and martial uncle’s painting wouldn’t be enough to ensure Lin Yun’s safety?”

“Jin Jue is a good hound,” Mu Chuan’s face changed. “Are we going to let this matter rest?”

“I’ll personally make a trip to the Nether Divinity Clan. Even if the Nether Divinity Clan isn’t going to hand Jin Jue over, I must tell them that Lin Yun is a disciple of my Sword Sect!” Mu Xuankong’s eyes coldly flashed with a wisp of killing intent; he was clearly enraged.

Jin Jue's move against Lin Yun was the same as the Nether Divinity Clan slapping the Sword Sect on the face. If news of this gets out, it would significantly damage Sword Sect’s reputation. At that time, it would be havoc if the other Ancient Saint Clans did the same to their other disciples.

Even if the Sword Sect had declined, it wasn’t something that the Ancient Saint Clan could humiliate. Not even if it was an Ancient Saint Clan that has received a title from the Divine Dragon Era.

Mu Chuan’s face changed when he heard that because he didn’t think that Mu Xuankong would be so serious.

“Did Lin Yun really obtain the Blue Dragon Bone?” Mu Xuankong asked.

“He did, and it’s also a dragon bone with an innate divine rune. Otherwise, Junior Brother Feng Jue would be dead by now.” Mu Chuan replied.

“Keep it a secret, at least regarding the innate divine rune.” Mu Xuankong said with a grave expression. A Divine Dragon Bone was still fine. Even if the Divine Dragon Empire had it under strict control, some divine bones were still secretly leak out. But a divine bone with a divine rune was an entirely different story. If the Divine Dragon Empire knew about it, they would definitely pressure the Sword Sect into handing it over.

“I got it. I have already informed Lin Yun about it along the way back.” Mu Chuan nodded. He briefly hesitated before he continued, “I already told him about Junior Brother’s story.”

Mu Xuankong was briefly stunned when he heard that. He sighed, “He’d have known about it sooner or later. It doesn’t matter to let him know sooner. This is a world where the strong prey on the weak, and Jian Jingtian is tragic. He might’ve surpassed Martial Uncle with his potential, but he wasted twenty years!”

When mentioning Jian Jingtian, Mu Xuankong’s pupils were filled with sorrow.

“Let’s just hope that he won’t be a second Jian Jingtian,” said Mu Chuan.

“No!” Mu Xuankong interrupted. “It’s us. We can’t allow him to become a second Jian Jingtian. I also have responsibility for what happened back then We can’t allow such a tragic reenactment to happen again with Lin Yun!”

“Senior Brother, back then…” Mu Chuan felt terrible when he heard that. He knew that Mu Xuankong blamed himself for what happened to Jian Jingtian, but it had nothing to do with Mu Xuankong in reality.

“I’ll go to the Nether Divinity Clan and meet their patriarch. If anything happens, you and the other peak masters can handle it.” Mu Xuankong interrupted before he soared into the sky. He wanted to stand out for Lin Yun during this visit to the Nether Divinity Clan. He wanted to let everyone know that no one could bully a disciple of their Sword Sect!
