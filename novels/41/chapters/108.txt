Chapter 109 - Heavenly Flame Peak

Lin Yun descended from the ten thousand meter height. When he landed on the ground, the wind from his fall swept the fallen leaves in the area.

“How thrilling!” The ten thousand meter fall was simply exceptional.

Standing up, Lin Yun looked at the dense mountain forest. Towering trees gathered in large numbers and Lin Yun could sense the danger concealed in the woods.

If he wanted to reach the Heavenly Flame Peak, he would have to pass through the forest filled with demonic beasts. This could be considered a test for him. If he couldn’t get through this forest, he should give up on the Heavenly Flame Peak.

Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!

The clattering sound of hooves rang out. Lin Yun turned to see his Dragon Blooded Horse running through the forest. Taking a closer look, Lin Yun noticed that Lil’ Red’s aura had grown a whole lot stronger than before.

It had actually reached the Fourth Orifice of the Xiantian Realm!

“Wait, what?! Fourth orifice of the Xiantian Realm?” Lin Yun knitted his brows and couldn’t help feeling doubtful. The Dragon Blooded Horse’s aptitude was naturally better than his since it possessed a thin trace of dragon’s blood. So it shouldn’t be a problem for it to reach the third orifice of the Xiantian Realm after absorbing a nail-sized solidified spiritual essence.

But what was this jump to the fourth orifice of the Xiantian Realm? Did this fellow find a treasure in the forest?

No matter how Lin Yun tried to ponder, that was the best explanation he could come up with.

“You’re pretty lucky.” Lin Yun smiled.

Wait! Something’s not right! Lin Yun changed when he noticed that the Dragon Blooded Horse was wounded after coming close to him. The Dragon Blooded Horse had several wounds that seemed terrifying.

“Filthy beast, stop right there!”

Several powerful auras appeared, which made Lin Yun’s brows rise. He saw a total of six people coming over.

“Die you filthy beast!”

A silhouette suddenly descended from a tree branch and threw a punch at the Dragon Blooded Horse. However, the Dragon Blooded Horse suddenly turned around, raising its hooves and sending the person flying.

Pffft!

The person fell to the ground after being forced backwards and blood gushed from his mouth. The others took a deep breath and immediately came to a stop.

“This filthy beast isn’t running anymore?” They looked at the Dragon Blooded Horse cautiously.

“You guys seem unhappy with my horse?” A silhouette with a sword box descended in front of them. Lin Yun could tell that the six were only in the third orifice of the Xiantian Realm. They couldn’t pose any threat to him.

“Your horse? It’s great that you’re here then! Your horse took the Earth Origin Fruit of my Golden Flame Sect!”

“If you’re wise, get your horse to hand it over! Otherwise, you won’t be able to leave this forest!”

The Golden Flame Sect?

Lin Yun suddenly recalled the Golden Flame Sect had a nearby branch. It was the strongest force in the area. Like the Blood Cloud Sect, the Golden Flame Sect was also an overlord force in the Azure Sun County.

The entire sect practiced fire elemental cultivation techniques, similar to Lin Yun.

Whoosh!

While Lin Yun pondered, a robust man with a buzz cut appeared. He had a sinister scar stretched across his chiseled face.

“Protector Mo!” The six immediately bowed and pointed at Lin Yun, “Protector Mo, that Dragon Blooded Horse belongs to him!”

“The Dragon Blooded Horse wounded one of ours again!”

The buzz cut man looked at Lin Yun. He could tell that Lin Yun was only fifteen or sixteen, but his cultivation had already reached the third orifice of the Xiantian Realm. He instantly figured out that this young man must be the young master of a certain clan in Azure Sun County.

So he did not want to make things complicated and clasped his hands, “My name is Mo Ping, a Protector of Golden Flame Sect’s branch. May I ask about your name?”

“Lin Yun.”

No matter how hard Mo Ping pondered, he couldn’t think of any clan with the surname Lin. Then Lin Yun must be a foreigner. As a result of his discovery, Mo Ping became confident and his smile disappeared, “My Golden Flame Sect isn’t unreasonable. An Earth Origin Fruit costs about 100,000 mid-grade spiritual stones. If you’re willing to hand over this amount out, I’m willing to resolve this matter.”

100,000 mid-grade spiritual stones? Lin Yun sneered inwardly. Not even the Wan Clan could take out 100,000 mid-grade spiritual stones at once. Additionally, an Earth Origin Fruit was definitely not worth that price.

Even if he had that many spiritual stones, there was no way he would take it out.

Feeding healing pellets to the Dragon Blooded Horse, Lin Yun patted his hands together, “The Earth Origin Fruit is born by nature. So it’s yours because you say it is?”

Chewing on the pellets, the Dragon Blooded Horse sneered.

“You’re courting death!” Mo Ping had already wanted to kill Lin Yun and he was just fooling him with the cost. But he never imagined that Lin Yun wouldn’t buy it.

Letting out a snort, he charged at Lin Yun as his aura surged. He clenched his fists together and threw out a punch.

Looking at the punch coming towards him, Lin Yun raised his lips and threw out a punch as well. The colliding punches were competing to see whose spiritual energy was stronger.

Boom!

A huge explosion rang out. A trace of blood dripped from Mo Ping’s lips and he took a few steps back.

“Protector!” exclaimed the others. They never imagined that Lin Yun would be so strong.

“This punch is a lesson for you. Don’t think that you can bully anyone when you’re just a branch.” sneered Lin Yun.

Mo Ping’s face was grim. Looking at Lin Yun he said, “No one dares to act so arrogantly with us in the Sky Hibernation Mountains. Yet, someone in the third orifice like you dares to act with such arrogance? Let me tell you. My entire branch is training in this forest right now. If you dare make a move, I’ll guarantee that you will die a terrible death!”

“Is that so? Then why don’t you enlighten me? How can you be satisfied?” asked Lin Yun furiously.

A grin spread on Mo Ping’s face as he replied, “Simple. I don’t need 100,000 mid-grade spiritual stones from you. Your horse and 2,000 mid-grade spiritual stones will be just fine.”

“Indeed, that’s simple,” smiled Lin Yun before his expression turned grim, “but what a pity. Dream on!”

Lin Yun then led the Dragon Blooded Horse to leave. He did not want to waste his time with these people.

“Drop him!” hollered Mo Ping. The remaining six immediately pounced at Lin Yun, letting out roars that echoed in the forest.

Looking at the incoming cultivators, a furious Lin Yun swung his sword box.

Boom!

The sword box had sent three people flying away. They wailed out in pain and rolled on the ground. Now that both parties had fallen out, there was no reason for Lin Yun to hold back. As a result, he began wreaking havoc with the sword box.

With twenty thousand catty of strength combined with the sword box, smacking them around was too simple. He could easily smack them around with one hand without affecting his mobility.

After a few exchanges, the Golden Flame Sect cultivators were lying on the ground, groaning out in pain. Most of their bones had broken when the sword box smacked them. It turns out that they were only alive thanks to their cultivation.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Listening to the rustling sounds, Lin Yun could tell that people from the Golden Flame Sect’s branch were gathering. He jumped onto the Dragon Blooded Horse and commented, “Count yourselves lucky.”

Not long after he left, several figures descended from the sky.

“Mo Ping, what’s wrong with you?” questioned a man with knitted brows. He looked at the six lying on the ground.

“Chief Liu, our Earth Origin Fruit was robbed by an unreasonable person. Not only did he refuse to return the Earth Origin Fruit, but he even injured all of us here…”

Chief Liu was a middle-aged man, with cultivation in the fifth orifice of the Xiantian Realm. When he looked at Mo Ping, he knew that Mo Ping was hiding something from him. However, he wasn’t too bothered by what Mo Ping was hiding and instructed, “Since he dares provoke the Golden Flame Sect, consider him dead. Send out my orders! Everyone from the Golden Flame Sect’s branch is to hunt him!”

“Roger!” Someone immediately received Chief Liu’s order to issue instructions.

“Which direction did he go?” asked Chief Liu.

Mo Ping immediately replied, “Let me bring you there, Chief Liu.”

After the Dragon Blooded Horse recovered most of its wounds, its speed increased allowing it to bolt through the forest. Sitting on it, Lin Yun wasn’t too bothered by the two figures chasing after him.

“Split up!”

Swish!

Lin Yun jumped onto a tree branch. Without any burden, the Dragon Blooded Horse could run faster. Based on the speed of those two, there was no way they could catch up with Lil’ Red.

In a split second, the Dragon Blooded Horse lured Chief Liu and Mo Ping away from Lin Yun. Meanwhile, Lin Yun left for the Heavenly Flame Peak by himself. When he sensed the heatwave blowing at him two hours later, he was shocked.

When his sight opened up, he could see a barren land. The ground was scorching red, with rising smoke.

He could also see lava flowing within the cracks on the ground. When he raised his head, he could see a towering peak that emitted a horrifying temperature.

“The Heavenly Flame Peak!” exclaimed Lin Yun as he knitted his brows. He had underestimated the Heavenly Flame Peak.

Clatter! Clatter! Clatter! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Dragon Blooded Horse returned after throwing off its pursuers.

As Lin Yun’s brows loosen up, he smiled, “Don’t go stealing from others again. I can’t possibly help you every single time.”

However, the Dragon Blooded Horse shook its head and communicated with Lin Yun. After a moment later, Lin Yun finally realized what happened. So it turns out that the Dragon Blooded Horse did not steal the Earth Origin Fruit.

The Dragon Blooded Horse managed to get the Earth Origin Fruit after killing a demonic beast and those people launched a sneak attack at him.

“They’re pretty skilled at making bogus accusations.” If Lin Yun knew about it earlier, he would’ve gone heavier on them. Now that he thought about it again, those people must be guilty since they did not immediately call for the chief’s help.

But it no longer mattered. He couldn’t be bothered with the Golden Flame Sect. It would be weird if you could use logic to reason with an overlord force of the Azure Sun County.

“Well, going up the Heavenly Flame Peak now and forming the Fiery Demon Battle Physique is more important!”
