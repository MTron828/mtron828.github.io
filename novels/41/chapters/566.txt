Chapter 567 - Once More

Lin Yun’s voice left everyone from the Heavenly Province Academy shocked. From everyone’s impression, Lin Yun was always calm and rarely got furious or changed his decision. But he actually requested to fight next even though they planned to let Lin Yun go last.

Tang Yu, Mo Ling, and Liu Yunyan all looked at Lin Yun with shock in their eyes. They all had keen senses, so they could roughly guess Lin Yun’s idea. If they were destined to lose, then there was no need for Liu Yunyan to get on stage and suffer the same pain that Mu Xue went through. He would rather go next and teach the White Jade Academy a lesson.

“No, let me go next.” Liu Yunyan’s face was pale, but her eyes were filled with determination as she gnashed her teeth. Her voice broke, “Although I don’t have many chances against Chen Yu, I still have to give it a try. Please believe in me once.”

Lin Yun looked at Liu Yunyan, and he felt silent. He got angry when Mu Xue was beaten up, despite the fact that he didn’t like her. If someone like Liu Yunyan or Bai Yi, whom he had friendships with, went through that sort of pain, he was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to control himself.

“Please let me try. You should be last. We need this victory and I don’t wish to give up,” said Liu Yunyan. Everyone had their own persistence and Liu Yunyan was willing to give her life for the academy. She knew that she had to go up for the slight chance that they had. Then, Lin Yun would go last because he was the academy’s hope.

“Heavenly Province Academy VS White Jade Academy, please send out your participants for the second round,” The elderly voice spoke once more.

Lin Yun knew that many people were looking at him, but he didn’t dare to look at them, especially Liu Yunyan. He knew that his heart would become soft if he did. But he eventually gave in and looked at Liu Yunyan. He looked into her eyes and saw himself in her.

In the end, Lin Yun sighed and nodded his head. In the next second, two figures soared into the sky and landed on the stage. They were Liu Yunyan and Chen Yu. No one was surprised by this formation as the Heavenly Province Academy naturally had to leave Lin Yun for last, but this was based on the prerequisite that Liu Yunyan could defeat her opponent.

“I applaud your courage to show up before me after knowing that I can defeat the Flowing Cloud Academy’s helper,” smiled Chen Yu with disdain.

“The outcome is still unknown unless we fight,” said Liu Yunyan coldly.

Chen Yu narrowed his eyes and he fanned himself, “Haha, I advise you to admit defeat. Otherwise, I can only make you accountable for the humiliation my younger brother suffered.”

“Let’s see if you’re even capable of doing that!” Liu Yunyan barked as she drew her sword and charged forward.

“Pitiful tricks,” smiled Chen Yu as he spinned the fan in his hand. When the fan spun, a cold ray began to spread out from the fan.

“I only need three moves to defeat you.” Chen Yu released his aura and gently waved the fan in his hand. His move might seem casual, but anyone could tell that the power Chen Yu had accumulated was like a tidal wave.

When Liu Yunyan’s sword bolted over, Chen Yu waved his fan and instantly caused an explosion that sent Liu Yunyan flying. The difference between their cultivation was too great. Furthermore, Chen Yu’s attainments in the martial dao were clearly higher.

“That’s the first move,” sneered Chen Yu as he opened his fan and pounced forward like a bolt of lightning. As he activated his movement technique, a cold ray shot out and left cracks on the ground, which shocked everyone since Chen Yu’s previous attack was already so terrifying.

Lin Yun looked up ahead as this was within his expectation. After all, Chen Yu could even defeat the disciple of an overlord force, not to mention Liu Yunyan.

The faces of Mo Ling and the others weren’t exactly great either as the miracle that they were hoping for didn’t occur.

Chen Yu didn’t stop with his second attack and he threw out another move. Two moves later, his aura had fully exploded as thunderclouds surged in the sky and brought along immense pressure. The pressure alone was enough to give Liu Yunyan difficulty to stand.

“This is the end!” Chen Yu’s eyes were filled with indifference as he slashed down with his fan like a sword. The thunderclouds in the surroundings gathered above his fan as a three hundred meter long lightning bolt shot out. It was so powerful that it could even split a mountain.

Facing Chen Yu’s attacks, Liu Yunyan’s face became grave as she poured all her origin energy into her sword and charged forward. When the two clashed, their collision produced a rumbling explosion, but Chen Yu’e attack still landed on her. Liu Yunyan was immediately sent flying with a mouthful of blood. When she landed on the stage, she had great difficulty remaining on her feet.

“You’re still not going to surrender?!” Chen Yu landed on the ground with a smug grin as he fanned himself.

However, a decisive light flashed through Liu Yunyan’s eyes as she began to form an ancient seal with her hands. In the next second, countless spiritual runes intertwined around her and caused her aura to increase.

“This is…”

“This is the aura of a lesser divine ability!” The spectators’ faces changed when they sensed the abnormality in the atmosphere. Mo Ling also frowned her brows before she shook her head.

As for Chen Yu, he was initially startled by the aura before he calmed down. He scoffed, “How stubborn. It’s impossible for you to use a lesser divine ability with your attainments in spiritual runes. Let me give you a straightforward defeat.”

Chen Yu then charged forward like a bolt of lightning. Before Liu Yunyan could gather all the spiritual runes she needed, the spiritual runes around her crumbled as Chen Yu’s fan slashed down like a sharp blade.

Once again, Liu Yunyan threw up a mouthful of blood and was sent flying away.

“You’re courting death to try and use a lesser divine ability,” said Chen Yu with disdain.

Looking at Liu Yunyan who was sent flying away, a figure charged out before Mo Ling could even stand up. Lin Yun had streaked across the sky as he held onto Liu Yunyan.

When Chen Yu saw this, he frowned his brows and sneered, “The Heavenly Province Academy doesn’t seem to have any capability aside from admitting defeat. I know that you’re here to admit defeat, so don’t bother talking.”

His ridicule soured the faces of everyone from the Heavenly Province Academy. But there was nothing they could say because it was the truth. Mo Ling had interfered in the previous battle, but now, Lin Yun showed up naturally to admit defeat on Liu Yunyan’s behalf.

When Lin Yun looked at the mockery on Chen Yu’s face, his face became terrifyingly displeased.

“Am I wrong?” Chen Yu fanned himself and smiled, “It’s a pity that there’s nothing you can do about it despite your anger. The Heavenly Province Academy has already lost. Get lost and don’t embarrass yourself anymore.”

Chen Yu was happy with the rage he saw in Lin Yun’s pupils. He liked the feeling of his opponent being helpless and not being able to do anything despite their anger. It was even more satisfying than defeating Lin Yun personally.

“Don’t lower yourself to his level. Let’s go,” said Liu Yunyan in Lin Yun’s embrace. She had never suffered such a heavy injury in her life. She lived her life for the Five Academies’ Competition, and now, she had to live with the guilt of losing.

“I’ve yet to accomplish what I promised you…”

“But we’ve already lost,” said Liu Yunyan helplessly.

“You forgot that I’m someone who came out from hell. So I don’t mind going through it once more,” smiled Lin Yun. He had once chosen Hell Mode for himself. Today, he was going to choose it once more for the promise he made with his friend.

Placing Liu Yunyan down, Lin Yun looked around before he made a request, “I would like to make a request for Hell Mode.”

“Hell Mode!” All the spectators were shocked when they heard it. Everyone looked at Lin Yun. Did he know what Hell Mode meant? Did he know that the Heavenly Province Academy was humiliated because of Hell Mode two decades ago?

Could it be that the Heavenly Province Academy was going to tackle Hell Mode once more? The crowd felt that Lin Yun was simply insane.
