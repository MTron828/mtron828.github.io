Chapter 780 - Speechless

Many people felt that Yang Teng’s sword aura was undisturbed and that none of his injuries were lethal. For a genius like him, such injuries were practically nothing. As long as he could endure two more moves, his sword aura would reach its limit and he would be able to turn the tables.

It was impossible for Ye Qingfeng to maintain his current momentum and his origin energy would run out sooner or later. The battle was proceeding as Bai Ling expected. Yang Teng’s attacks continued to change like he was in a sorry state, but his sword aura was undisturbed.

The sword aura he emitted became even more boundless as it spread throughout the entire stage. The moment he launched his counterattack, it would surely be unparalleled. When that happened, Ye Qingfeng would surely lose.

“According to you, there’s one move left. I can’t wait to see how Ye Qingfeng defeats Yang Teng.” Bai Ling sneered and glanced at Lin Yun with disdain. But the moment he finished speaking, a rumbling sound came from the stage after Ye Qingfeng stomped his foot on the stage.

The entire stage began to tremble violently and the surrounding lake water fluctuated, shattering the sword aura that covered the entire stage. This made Yang Teng’s face change as his sword aura was his trump card for turning the tables. How could he defeat Ye Qingfeng now that his sword aura was shattered?

But just when he was about to move, the purple moon lit up brightly and frantically devoured the surrounding sword aura. At this moment, the purple moon was like a bottomless abyss. Yang Teng stood in shock as the purple moon became even more brilliant.

“Go down!” Ye Qingfeng roared as he took a step forward and reached Yang Teng’s chest. Yang Teng was sent flying and he threw up blood. Clearly, even if he was able to defend, there was no way to resist the terrifying blow. Just like that, he was kicked off the stage and the profound amber aura in his jade token was seized.

“Indigomoon Sutra!” The face of Azurewood Pavilion’s Bai Ling was ugly. He had clearly underestimated the power of this cultivation technique that could devour someone’s sword aura.

Bai Ling’s senior brother, Jue Chen of the seven geniuses, looked at Lin Yun calmly. He wasn’t surprised by this outcome, but he was curious how Lin Yun managed to see it. As for the others, their faces were complicated as the outcome was just like what Lin Yun had said. Ye Qingfeng defeated Yang Teng, which was a resounding slap to Bai Ling’s face. At this moment, no one dared to look down on Lin Yun.

The battle between the two groups continued, with Feng Wudao, Fang Hanluo, Jue Chen, and the others obtaining victories. Out of all of them, Jue Chen shined the brightest. Even though he was one of the seven geniuses, none of his opponents admitted defeat. After all, they would rather lose on the stage than lose with their tails between their legs. No one would admit defeat like they did in the first round.

It was a shame that Jue Chen was too strong. Even though everyone was brave, they weren’t even able to comprehend how Jue Chen attacked. Consistently, all of his opponents were sent flying with blood dripping from their mouths. In the seventh group, Feng Wudao managed to keep up his perfect record. He even gave others a feeling that he still had many trump cards left.

As for Fang Hanluo, he grew even stronger the more he fought. He consistently made breakthroughs in his battle even though his opponent was powerful. In fact, he barely managed to win after exchanging over five hundred moves. The fight was brutal and he received many injuries, but he looked unconcerned with the injuries, which puzzled everyone around him.

“Bai Ling VS Lin Yun!” The judge announced that Lin Yun and Bai Ling would be facing off.

“Ye Qingfeng, who do you think will win the fight?” Someone asked. Ye Qingfeng knew that Lin Yun had predicted his win and the person who asked him was also testing his ability to judge.

Ye Qingfeng glanced at Jue Chen and smiled, “I might not like him, but the Azurewood Pavilion is ranked at the bottom of the nine overlord forces. Bai Ling doesn't even have a 50% chance of winning against Lin Yun.”

Only disciples of the Indigomoon Elysium dared to say that the Azurewood Pavilion’s foundation was weak in front of Jue Chen.

“Maybe. But it won’t be easy for Lin Yun to win.” Jue Chen smiled mysteriously as if Bai Ling had a powerful trump card.

On the stage, Bai Ling looked at Lin Yun, “Your eyesight is great. But a fight between experts isn’t only about eyesight. It won’t be easy for you to defeat me.”

Bai Ling’s words didn’t sound like they were for Lin Yun. Instead, it was more like he was reassuring himself. After all, to a certain extent, eyesight equates to strength. So Bai Ling felt some pressure while facing Lin Yun.

“Maybe this will be easier than I thought,” replied Lin Yun. Bai Ling locked his brows together as Lin Yun’s indifference made him somewhat anxious. It was as if Lin Yun never considered him an opponent, which made him uncomfortable.

Does this fellow have a trump card? They both won ten fights in a row, so one of their winning streaks was about to come to an end. So, many people were paying attention to this fight.

“I can sense your sword intent. Launch your attack or else you won’t even have the chance to draw your sword later.” Lin Yun looked at Bai Ling calmly with the Flower Burial Sword in his hand. The moment he said that, the crowd became noisy because Bai Ling didn’t even use his sword in the previous fights.

“What arrogance! It’s still unknown who will win!” Bai Ling could no longer suppress his rage as he drew his sword just as Lin Yun instructed. When he drew his sword, a sword ray soared into the sky that was accompanied by a water geyser. In that split second, Bai Ling’s sword aura reached a powerful level that made many people’s eyes light up.

“Wind!” Bai Ling charged over with his sword like a water tornado. This move was somewhat similar to Lin Yun’s Heavenly Shatter Cloud, but it was also different at the same time. After all, wind was the main element and water was the second element in this move.

With a brilliant sword hum, Lin Yun unsheathed his sword by one inch and destroyed the water tornado that charged over. When Lin Yun fully drew his sword, Bai Ling was forced to expose himself.

“What power!” Bai Ling was inwardly shocked. He had never seen such a powerful sword technique among those in the same generation. Lin Yun had merely used his sword aura to resolve his attack. At this moment, Bai Ling knew that he couldn’t hold back anymore and activated his sword intent.

With the empowerment of his sword intent, Bai Ling’s sword aura began to gather like dust before forming a mountain. But Lin Yun was calm as he faced Bai Ling with the Iris Sword Sutra. Lin Yun was so nonchalant that he didn’t even use his sword intent. In the next moment, they flashed towards each other with sparks flying across the stage.

The audience didn’t dare to turn their eyes away from such an interesting battle. Lin Yun and Bai Ling’s sword techniques were powerful and their attainments were deep. Occasionally, there would be a blinding sword ray explosion. This meant that every single clash was thrilling and all those who were strong were alarmed by the fight.

But gradually, they began to feel doubtful because Lin Yun didn’t use his sword intent. After all, there was a legend that Lin Yun had high attainments in his sword intent. In fact, according to the legend, not many people could compare to him. So the crowd began to feel suspicious that Lin Yun wasn’t using his sword techniques to face Bai Ling.

Lin Yun didn’t think too much because he didn’t want to reveal too many of his trump cards. However, he didn’t hold back much of his Iris Sword Sutra. Half of the Iris Flower had bloomed, filling his body with origin energy. Additionally, the sword energy in his sword wasn’t weak.

But even after a long time later, Bai Ling wasn’t able to gain an advantage in the fight. So the more he fought, the more alarmed he became as Lin Yun was like an unfathomable abyss. He refused to believe that he couldn’t force out Lin Yun’s true strength.

“Falling Autumn Leaves, Omnipotent Sweep!” Pushing his sword intent in lesser mastery to the limit, a sorrowful feeling spread out of the stage and a cold wind sent chills down everyone’s spines. Bai Ling was truly talented to fuse his sword intent together with his sword technique.

But it was a pity that Bai Ling ran into Lin Yun. Lin Yun simply shook his wrist and ten water tornadoes flew out to envelop the entire stage.

Heavenly Cloud Shatter!

When Bai Ling clashed with Lin Yun, he was sent flying with a trace of blood dripping from his lips. He narrowed his pupils because he was shocked that Lin Yun’s cultivation technique could unleash such prowess. At this moment, he knew that he couldn’t hold back any more.

“Shaking Heaven and Earth!” Bai Ling finally used his strongest attack. This move could heavly injure a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm expert. He hadn’t grasped his move completely, so he would also suffer the backlash, but he knew that he couldn’t hold back anymore.

Bai Ling’s clothes began to flutter violently as lightning flickered in the sky. His aura began to rise frantically while his expression turned sinister. He gave everyone the feeling that he could split the entire stage into two.

This scene made Lin Yun’s heart tremble because he felt danger from this attack. This was the first time he felt threatened at the banquet. So by instinct, Lin Yun also brought out his sword intent in greater mastery.

Lin Yun and Bai Ling’s sword intent were both in the xiantian sword intent, but the difference between lesser and greater was great, especially since the speed of Lin Yun’s sword intent had surpassed even Bai Ling’s imagination.

Lin Yun practically moved by instinct because he felt threatened. His body reacted naturally without expending any energy.

In the next second, Bai Ling, who had raised his sword above his head, vomited blood and flew backwards. His sword was still in mid-air, but he had already fainted as blood flowed out of his chest. When Bai Ling’s sword landed on the ground, the silence was broken.

Everyone looked at Lin Yun with their eyes popping out of their heads. However, no one could utter a word as if their throats were stuck. Just what kind of sword technique was that?
