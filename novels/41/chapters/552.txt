Chapter 553 - Provocation

The White Jade Academy was one of the five academies in the competition. They were weaker than the champion of the previous competition, the Violethut Academy. But even so, they were still a formidable opponent to the academy. They decided to pay the academy a visit when the competition was starting soon. This could only mean that they weren’t here to express goodwill.

“Who did the White Jade Academy bring along?” Tang Yu responded rather calmly.

“It’s only the disciples. They said that they have heard about the academy’s reputation for a long time, so they came to visit,” replied Yu Mu.

“They must be unconvinced. Since it’s a matter between the younger generations, then we’ll leave it to the younger generation. Let Lil’ Xue and Lin Yun take a look,” sneered Tang Yu.

Hearing Tang Yu’s words, Mu Xue glanced at Lin Yun and replied, “I’m all we need.”

Upon knowing that Lin Yun was also one of the participants, she decided to act less arrogantly. However, her words were still unfriendly. In her view, Lin Yun was unnecessary.

Compared to Mu Xue, Lin Yun had no fluctuation in his emotions as he maintained his composure.

Tang Yu smiled bitterly, “Lass, you might be in the Heavenly Sword Sect, but there are many things in the world that you don’t know. Not all geniuses are in the overlord forces. Coincidentally, Lin Yun is one of those geniuses. He might have just become a third grade spiritualist, but he’s definitely stronger than you.”

Mu Xue was surprised by those words, but she disagreed with them. However, she didn’t question Tang Yu. After all, Tang Yu was an expert even in the Heavenly Sword Sect. She simply felt that Tang Yu’s eyesight must be insufficient because he stayed in the academy too long.

After all, the foundation of an overlord force wasn’t something that a quasi-overlord force could be compared to. The inner disciples of an overlord sect could be a core disciple in a quasi-overlord force. As for their core disciples, they were existences that disciples of the academy could only look up to.

“You must mean weaker…” Mu Xue’s eyes flashed as she released her aura upon Lin Yun. She did it all of a sudden, which would have injured anyone that was caught by surprise. If Lin Yun was weaker than her, then he would definitely throw up a mouthful of blood.

Lin Yun never paid any attention to Mu Xue right from the beginning, but he sensed her aura the moment she unleashed it. Raising his brow, Lin Yun also unleashed an aura that wasn’t any inferior to hers.

The clash of their auras caused a fluctuation in the surrounding air and Lin Yun’s figure was blurred by the fluctuation. When the fluctuation disappeared, Lin Yun appeared unharmed.

Mu Xue was surprised and she pounced forward. She didn’t release her sword intent, but she was like a sword that emitted a powerful gale that made Lin Yun’s cheeks hurt from the wind. This made Lin Yun’s face change a little because an overlord force’s disciple was truly extraordinary.

Mu Xue was only an inner disciple, but she alone was stronger than many core disciples. Compared to her, the Sword Firmament Pavilion was not worth mentioning. But even a speck of dust had its pride, not to mention Lin Yun. Since Mu Xue dared to provoke him, then he would show her the consequences.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as the Iris Flower in his violet palace opened up. His silver origin energy began to surge through his body and he threw a punch at Mu Xue.

Mu Xue pounced at Lin Yun very quickly, but she was sent flying at double the speed. When she fell onto the ground, her face was red as she let out a groan. Circulating her origin energy to cancel out the energy left in her body, Mu Xue looked at Lin Yun for the first time and said, “You’re not as weak as I imagined that you can take 30% of my strength.”

Her cold voice was filled with reluctance, but her arrogance had died down a little. When Lin Yun heard that, he smiled because he didn’t even use 30% of his strength.

“Lass, now you know that I’m telling the truth, right?” said Tang Yu.

“I’ve yet to use my sword,” said Mu Xue as she retracted her gaze.

The strength of the Heavenly Sword Sect’s disciples was vastly different when they used their swords. Then again, Lin Yun had directly ignored what she said. After all, she was still too lacking with her initial xiantian sword intent.

Lin Yun knew that she hadn’t seen him when he used his sword. Otherwise, she would definitely regret her words.

“Alright, cut it out. The White Jade Academy’s disciples are here to cause trouble. As elders, there’s no way we can interfere in this matter. The Five Academies Competition will start in ten days and I don’t want any unfavorable rumors. Get going,” said Tang Yu.

“Let’s go take a look at the White Jade Academy’s disciples then,” replied Mu Xue. It was normal for an outsider to come and provoke them to boost their reputation. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Every force paid great attention to their reputation, not to mention that the Five Academies Competition was starting soon.

“Don’t underestimate Lin Yun. If you do, then you’ll definitely suffer a greater loss than today.” Tang Yu’s voice transmitted to Mu Xue’s ears just before she left. His words made Mu Xue’s body freeze briefly, but she didn’t reveal any emotions on her face.

“You’re more than enough to deal with this matter,” said Lin Yun. He didn’t have a good impression of this lady, so he didn’t want to be lumped together with her.

“Cut the crap.” Mu Xue glanced at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun had no idea why she changed her mind all of a sudden, but he smiled helplessly as he followed her. After all, her grandfather owed him a fourth grade pellet.

Along the way, the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples were attracted to Mu Xue and many even became emotional when they recognized her. But none of them dared to come up to greet her. Mu Xue wasn’t bothered by them and she continued walking.

“Lin Yun, did Big Sister Mo really recommend you?” Mu Xue ultimately started talking first. There was nothing for Lin Yun to hide, so he answered her honestly. He could see Mu Xue’s eyes flash with reverence when Mo Ling was mentioned.

“Incredible.” Mu Xue turned around to examine Lin Yun. Lin Yun wasn’t weak, but that was all there was to him. It was still too forceful for him to stand out in the Five Academies Competition.

“You have a better candidate, right?” Lin Yun suddenly spoke out.

Mu Xue was shocked by Lin Yun’s keen senses. She calmed herself down and replied, “Indeed. I’m not going to keep it from you. Mei Ziyan recommended a person to my grandfather. The Five Academies Competition concerns the life and death of the academy, so I hope that you can let go of the position willingly.”

Her expression was grave and she didn’t seem to be joking around.

“I never go against my promise. If you’re willing, then you can give up your position instead,” said Lin Yun.

“Don’t regret it then.” Mu Xue turned around furiously as she quickened her pace.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the Infernal Plaza. This was an area that Lin Yun was familiar with and there were many disciples gathered here. When Mu Xue raised her head, her face changed.

Lin Yun followed her gaze and saw two people fighting at the center of the plaza. But the disciple wearing the Heavenly Province Academy’s clothes was clearly weaker than his opponent. The white-clothed youth had a powerful cultivation and he could easily end the battle quickly. However, he was currently toying with his opponent.

After a series of exchanges, the purple-clothed Heavenly Province Academy’s disciple was sent flying.

“The Heavenly Province Academy has really declined. Even this so-called core disciple is so weak,” sneered the white-clothed youth. His arrogance naturally made many disciples unhappy, but the white-clothed youth had defeated numerous people and none of them dared to step forward.

The white-clothed youth sneered, “My strength is nothing in the White Jade Academy. You guys can’t even beat me, so why bother with the competition?”

When he finished, he led a party out of the Infernal Plaza with disdain on his face. All the disciples who stood in his way had no choice but to open a path for him. However, just when they were about to leave, they saw two people blocking the entrance. The two were naturally Lin Yun and Mu Xue.

The white-clothed youth’s face changed when he sensed Lin Yun and Mu Xue’s aura. He could sense danger coming from the lady, but when he looked at Lin Yun, he wore a disdainful smile, “You dare to stand in my way? If you’re tactful, you should lie down and roll away.”

“Don’t embarrass the academy,” said Mu Xue as she retreated. She wanted to see Lin Yun’s strength.
