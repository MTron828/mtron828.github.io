Chapter 291 - That's Impossible!

“What a powerful sword gale!” Lin Yun could sense how powerful the gale was when he stepped on the island. The white sword runes that combined with the gale had created a powerful sword intent. Unlike demonic beasts, cultivators had to utilize their origin energy to form a layer of defense on their bodies.

It was a messy fight between cultivators and demonic beasts. It was a brutal scene. And occasionally, cultivators that were unlucky were killed instantly. The white herb that was brimming with sword intent was simply too tempting.

There were also some people who were scheming to obtain the herb through this messy fight. However, they were instantly covered in injuries whenever they got close to the gale and died to the demonic beasts.

The defense of the demonic beasts was shocking. It wasn’t easy for their bulk to be torn apart. The fight for the Imperial Sword Herb was tougher than anyone had imagined. Many disciples gave up for the second-best reward, the tricolored auspicious signs, that descended from the sky. The auspicious signs could increase their cultivation, giving effects that were better than pellets.

As more cultivators joined the fight, the battle at the island became even more chaotic. The demonic beasts gradually became the losing side, which forced many of the demonic beasts to execute their abilities. Some sprayed poison, some breathed fire, and some shot icy beams from their eyes.

The cultivators who were hit by those abilities let out a miserable cry as they retreated. The last batch of demonic beasts were lords among demonic beasts in the same stage. Not only were they powerful, but they also had high intelligence.

The island was soon dyed red with blood. Only the Imperial Sword Herb stood proudly and untainted. It was like a sword pointing at the sky.

“These demonic beasts are really terrifying.” Gu Beixuan and Lin Qiushan were having a tough time dealing with a demonic beast, the Ironbacked Fiendbull. It had a powerful defense and their swords could only leave white marks on the bull.

If it wasn’t for the fact that they both possessed sword intent, they would have a tough time trying to break through its defenses. A golden ray lit up behind them. It was Lin Yun who stepped forward and threw out a punch. His punch was accompanied by saintly music, which sent the Ironbacked Fiendbull flying.

“Thanks, Brother Zhong.” Lin Qiushan let out a breath of relief.

“Brother Zhong, it looks like our thoughts were a little too naive. It’s simply too hard trying to open a path through the demonic beasts,” smiled Gu Beixuan bitterly.

“Relax. The demonic beasts might have the advantage in numbers, but they will die if this carries on. This situation won’t last long,” smiled Lin Yun.

“You’re saying that they will retreat?” Gu Beixuan’s eyes lit up at the news.

“These demonic beasts are intelligent and their intelligence isn’t any lower than men. The Imperial Sword Herb might be tempting, but their lives are more important,” explained Lin Yun.

“Big Sister!” Lin Yan suddenly called out. When everyone turned their heads over, their faces changed. Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan were dealing with a Scarletflame Tiger and they purposely lured the tiger over to them.

Many of the three alliance-unions’ disciples were caught in the fight and many of them were heavily injured. Meanwhile, Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan both sneered as they lured the sixth stage lord-rank demonic beast towards Lin Yan and Tian Fei.

“Damn it!” Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan raged. But before they could even make their moves, the Ironbacked Fiendbull came charging right back.

“You two handle the Ironbacked Fiendbull for now. I’ll go over and help.” Lin Yun’s figure flashed and he disappeared, leaving behind afterimages in his path. After about seven steps, he appeared before Lin Yan and Tian Fei.

The Scarletflame Tiger’s fur was covered in flames as it landed in front of them. It was so huge that it cast a huge shadow over Lin Yan and the rest. Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan both sneered when they saw this scene.

“Let’s go. This Scarletflame Tiger is enough to deal with them. They’re still too tender to fight with us,” sneered Xiao Feng.

“Our greatest opponent here is Gu Yunfei. That fellow’s Shattercloud Sword is terrifying,” said Wei Songhan.

“He’s nothing. He’s alone. So what if he can obtain the Imperial Sword Herb? The real question is if he can leave with it? Our true opponents are Nie Tian and Han Feng…” But before Xiao Feng could finish his words, a loud wail sounded out. When Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan directed their gazes over, they saw the Scarletflame Tiger rolling on the ground in pain.

“Zhong Yunxiao!” Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan both saw Lin Yun standing in front of Lin Yan and the party.

“Him again!” Wei Songhan’s face sank.

“Shall we deal with him first?” Xiao Feng’s eyes flashed with a cold light. But right at this moment, the demonic beasts suddenly retreated.

This abrupt scene left everyone stunned briefly before they charged towards the Imperial Sword Herb. Gu Yunfei was charging at the front with his black greatsword. Anyone who was in his way was sent flying with a strike. He was actually more ruthless than the demonic beasts were with their attacks. Nie Tian and Han Feng were right behind him.

“Let’s go!” When Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan saw this scene, their faces changed. They no longer cared about Lin Yun and charged towards the Imperial Sword Herb. This abrupt change in the situation allowed Lin Qiushan, Gu Beixuan, and Chen Ling to join up with the rest of the party.

“Brother Zhong, you really got it,” said Lin Qiushan. She asked, “What should we do now?”

Gu Beixuan looked at Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan before he spoke coldly, “If it weren’t for those two bastards, Brother Zhong would’ve been first.”

“No worries. It’s still uncertain who will be taking the Imperial Sword Herb,” said Lin Yun. “I hope that everyone can stand with me if I manage to obtain the Imperial Sword Herb. I will share some of it with you guys at that time.”

Was taking the Imperial Sword Herb difficult? It wasn’t, but it was difficult trying to leave with everyone eyeing them. Lin Yun was all by himself and he would have to reveal his identity if he were to leave by himself. But if he had the help of Lin Qiushan and everyone else, it would become much simpler.

“Please be assured, Brother Zhong. Your words are enough. If you can obtain the Imperial Sword Herb, I will definitely be on your side,” said Lin Qiushan.

“So will we.” Gu Beixuan and Chen Ling both gave their replies without any hesitation. If it wasn’t for Lin Yun, they wouldn’t be able to compete with so many people. Furthermore, they didn’t have any better choices.

“Deal!” Lin Yun smiled. The Golden Crow Seal behind him flickered and he bolted towards the Imperial Sword Herb.

“What speed!” exclaimed Lin Qiushan. She then waved her hand, “Open a path for Brother Zhong!”

The three alliance-unions disciples then immediately moved without any hesitation. The fight for the Imperial Sword Herb was reaching the climax.

Lin Yun was incredibly fast with the Seven Profound Steps, dodging many attacks while making his way towards the Imperial Sword Herb.

Suddenly, several attacks came in his direction and Lin Yun turned around with a punch to shatter those attacks. The attacks came from the Violetcloud Alliance’s disciples. They attacked when they saw Lin Yun catching up to Nie Tian. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“This fellow…” The faces of the four from the Violetcloud Alliance changed when they saw how easily Lin Yun dealt with their attacks.

“You guys want to play? Let’s play then.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. Like an Ancient Golden Crow, Lin Yun dashed at them and swung his punches out like swords, which contained his combined origin energy and dracophant energy.

“You’re courting death!” The four were elites in the Violetcloud Alliance and their cultivation was in the pinnacle fourth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. They instantly executed their strongest moves when they saw Lin Yun coming at them.

However, their attacks merely lasted for a split second. When Lin Yun’s attack reached them, their faces turned pale and the layer of origin energy around them shattered. They were instantly covered in injuries by the sword gale as they fell onto the ground.

“Holy shit!”

“Who’s he?”

“I heard that his name is Zhong Yunxiao, someone we’ve never heard before.” Many people were shocked when they saw how Lin Yun took those four elites out with a punch. After all, those four were in a pinnacle fourth stage, but Lin Yun took them out with a punch.

“Stop him!” Nie Tian’s face changed as he yelled for everyone else in the Violetcloud Alliance to stop Lin Yun. He knew that things would go south for him if Lin Yun caught up.

Han Feng also wore a grave expression and he instructed, “Disciples of the Witheraqua Alliance, stop him! Don’t let him get close to the Imperial Sword Herb!”

“Fire Alliance disciples, stop him!”

“Upstream Alliance disciples, kill him!” Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan both yelled with an ugly expression. In that split second, Lin Yun had become public enemy number one.

“Dream on!” Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan’s faces sank. They immediately charged forward with their alliance-unions to stop everyone from interrupting Lin Yun.

Gu Yunfei, on the other hand, was sneering in his heart. No one came for him now that everyone went after Lin Yun.

“How naive,” sneered Lin Yun. He suddenly emitted a golden dazzle and soared into the sky. He was like an ancient bird that drew a long golden streak in the sky. When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he was only a thousand meters away from the Imperial Sword Herb.

This made Gu Yunfei, who was sneering, feel utterly dumbfounded. Not only him, but Xiao Feng, Wei Songhan, Nie Tian, and Han Feng all exclaimed, “That’s impossible!”
