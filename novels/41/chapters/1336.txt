Chapter 1337 - Competing for the Saint Elixir

The competition in that region was intense and there were thirteen corpses lying on the ground. As for Lesser Elysium Core Realm experts, one-third of them had already retreated. Those who still dared to compete for the saint elixir were all Greater Elysium Core Realm experts. There were eight demonic cultivators from the Ancient Barren Domain and other elders from the powerful sects, so they all had a powerful foundation.

But Lin Yun didn’t want to deal with so much trouble. With a single thought, a dragon roar echoed from his body and enveloped him in a golden light. As purple-golden dragon runes began to move about on the surface of his body, he emitted a terrifying dragon aura that enveloped the entire region. This made the faces of the thirteen Greater Elysium Core Realm experts who were fighting amongst themselves to change when they sensed the terrifying aura coming from Lin Yun.

“Flower Burial!” All of them squinted their eyes. There wasn’t a single person who didn’t know about Lin Yun’s name, especially after they witnessed his fight with Qin Cang outside the pagoda. Facing such a heaven-defying opponent like Qin Cang, Lin Yun managed to last a few moves, which gave everyone a deep impression.

“Lin Yun, you’re a swordsman. Do you know the meaning of ‘first come, first serve’?”

“We discovered this saint elixir first!”

“Leave immediately or we’ll inform the Profound Sky Sect of your location. At that time, you’ll only die!” They all stopped and tried to threaten Lin Yun. They were even hesitating if they should join forces to expel him. Evidently, it would be best for them if he leaves.

But before they could finish, a powerful aura exploded from Lin Yun’s body as he pushed his palm forth, executing the Azure Dragon Grasp. As the surrounding space began to tremble, three thousand purple-golden dragon runes began to move towards his palm and manifested into a dragon claw.

Before his palm landed, the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts who were still threatening Lin Yun earlier all had their faces changed. They didn’t hesitate to unleash their strongest attack before trying to escape the range of the dragon claw.

But Lin Yun’s palm was too fast and not one of the thirteen Greater Elysium Core Realm experts managed to escape. As all of them threw out mouthfuls of blood, their faces were pale as they looked at Lin Yun with fear in their eyes.

“Lin Yun, you’re too arrogant!” They were all heavily injured.

But Lin Yun didn’t bother about them and circulated the Iris Sword Sutra. As a sea of purple flower petals appeared behind him, Lin Yun flicked his fingers with both hands, executing the Flicking Divine Finger—Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword!

In the next second, hundreds of swords flew out from behind Lin Yun, causing the thirteen of them to continue to retreat while being covered with wounds.

“Sword!” But Lin Yun didn’t stop at that. He summoned the Lightning Shadow Sword from the sword box on his back. When the Lightning Shadow Sword left the sheath, a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert was split into two.

When Lin Yun stowed the Lightning Shadow Sword, the surroundings fell into dead silence. When the remaining twelve Greater Elysium Core Realm experts looked at Lin Yun again, they suppressed their rage with fear flashing in their pupils.

“The saint elixir goes to me. Does anyone have an opposing opinion about it?” Lin Yun stood in mid-air and emitted a dazzling golden glow from his body. But facing his words, none of them dared to utter a single word and could only acknowledge what Lin Yun said.

“Very good.” Lin Yun stowed the pair of golden wings behind him and descended from the sky. To be able to intimidate the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts was already the best outcome possible. If a battle broke out amongst them, the commotion caused by their fight would be great, and he might even suffer some injuries from the fight.

“Lin Yun, you bastard. You only know how to bully the weak! Go after the Profound Sky Sect if you have the guts!” A demonic cultivator spoke out. But when Lin Yun raised his head to look at him, that demonic cultivator was scared to the point that he took several steps back. This made the demonic cultivator nervously said, “What are you looking at? I’m already not going after the saint elixir. You want to kill me?”

“Trash,” said Lin Yun.

“Lin Yun, don’t push it!” That demonic cultivator’s face turned red. He was already over a hundred years old, so he naturally became furious after being humiliated by Lin Yun.

“Haha.” Lin Yun snorted, “Bully the weak? The thirteen of you are Greater Elysium Core Realm experts. Don’t talk as if you didn’t bully the weak. Otherwise, why don’t you explain to me where the Lesser Elysium Core Realm corpses on the ground came from? Don’t tell me you have no idea about it. Or do you think that the reasons are with you because you’re weak, and I have to give you the saint elixir just because I’m stronger than you? Do you need a doctor to take a look at your mind? Get lost!”

The demonic cultivator was left speechless upon hearing Lin Yun’s questions. He was just complaining a little, but he never expected that he would be so thoroughly humiliated that his face had turned red, but he couldn’t say a single word. In the end, the remaining twelve Greater Elysium Core Realm experts could only leave.

“This bastard is really arrogant, and there’s no way we can stay here anymore. But it’s a pity because there must be many treasures on this mountain that can give birth to a saint elixir.”

“He’s too ferocious. Let’s see if he can continue to be arrogant when we run into Qin Cang later.”

“He can only bully us. If he has the guts, then get him to bully Qin Cang!”

“He won’t dare because Qin Cang can easily kill him with a single hand!” Their voices were soft, but Lin Yun could easily hear what they were saying with his strength. Then again, he also wasn’t bothered about it because he knew that there would be a fight between him and Qin Cang sooner or later, and he would make them speechless at that time.

“Lin Yun, why don’t you have any temper? If I were in your position, I would’ve swallowed all of them. They’re simply courting death to dare to speak behind the back of someone stronger than them.” Lil’ Purple unhappily stood on the Snow Heed Blade while she looked at Lin Yun with disdain.

“You eat people?” Lin Yun asked in a shocked tone.

“Of course. In the Ancient Era, people eat the meat of divine beasts while divine beasts eat humans. It was normal back then. When I still had my main body, I would eat a hundred people a day. No, wait. I would eat ten thousand scumbags like you, so you better be polite to me or I’ll roast you before devouring you.” Lil’ Purple snorted.

But when Lin Yun heard that, he couldn’t help laughing. When Lil’ Purple saw that Lin Yun was laughing, she asked, “What? You don’t believe me?”

“I believe you. So why don’t you eat someone now?” Lin Yun pointed at the corpses lying on the ground and Lil’ Purple’s face changed when she heard that because she was clearly just boasting. She didn’t expect that Lin Yun would be so serious with her.

“You’re lame!” Lil’ Purple said with her cheeks puffed up.

But Lin Yun didn’t care about her and headed to where the saint elixir was, taking a few hundred meters with a single step. When he arrived at where the saint elixir was, it was a crimson fruit emitting a sacred aura. It was at least five thousand years old, and he could faintly see the outline of a vermillion bird flying around the fruit.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun took a whiff of the herbal fragrance, and he could sense his blood boiling within his body.

“Wow, it feels great.” Lin Yun sighed before storing the Vermillion Fruit. With that, he had obtained his first saint elixir here, but he knew that it wasn’t enough because his foundation was still too shallow. If he wanted to reach the Elysium Core Realm as soon as possible, one saint elixir wasn’t enough.

“The fengshui of this mountain is pretty good, and there should be other saint elixirs.” Lil’ Purple said in a confident tone after examining this mountain. She then briefly paused before she continued, “But you have to give up half of the saint elixirs you obtain.”

“What are you thinking?” Lin Yun patted Lil’ Purple’s head. She must be dreaming of wanting half of the saint elixirs here. Not only did she not help, but she kept saying how he was in a disadvantageous position when he faced Qin Cang. So Lin Yun had no intention of giving her any saint elixirs. As for spiritual elixirs that were over a thousand years old, he could give that a consideration.

“Ouch! You’re bullying me again!” Lil’ Purple held onto her head with tears welling in her eyes.

At the same time, Qin Cang was leading a group of Profound Sky Sect disciples and elders to look for treasures on a mountain. Ahead of them, there were several Greater Elysium Core Realm experts ganging up on an ominous beast.

The ominous beast was a black serpent with skin as tough as metal, and it was also covered in demonic runes. It could also breath out demonic flames that could even burn space, and its flames nearly burned the constellation of a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert.

As the black serpent let out a ferocious roar, many disciples of the Profound Sky Sect had their faces turned pale. The Greater Elysium Core Realm experts weren’t having an easy time against the black serpent either because their attacks were no different from tickling it as the demonic runes on the black serpent flashed.

Qin Cang was standing alone with an aloof expression. Lei Jue and Xuan Ying weren’t around him because this place was too huge, so the two of them had acted on their own.

As the four Greater Elysium Core Realm experts threw out a mouthful of blood, they were all sent flying by the black serpent. Right at that moment, the black serpent raised its body and breathed out demonic flames, tearing apart the aura of the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts.

“Trash!” Qin Cang looked at the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts with loathing in his eyes. But just when the demonic flames were about to reach the disciples of the Profound Sky Sect, Qin Cang finally made his move. He gently pushed his palm out and an explosion resounded. The space before him exploded with golden runes appearing.

“Rise!” Qin Cang raised both his hands and brought those disciples who couldn’t avoid it in time to the sky while the place they were initially in was enveloped in the demonic flames from the black serpent.

“Are you guys alright?” Qin Cang spoke in a much more gentle tone, but his facial expression was indifferent.

“Thank you, Senior Brother.” The few disciples quickly thanked Qin Cang after they were out of danger.

“Come back!” Qin Cang said, calling back those Greater Elysium Core Realm experts who wanted to continue to attack the black serpent. As golden light exploded from his body, he turned into a streak of light and flew over like a true dragon. When he raised his hand, it was like a dragon claw that grabbed onto the black serpent’s throat.

While Qin Cang stood in mid-air, a cold light flashing through his pupils. The black serpent’s head suddenly exploded with blood splashing around. This scene left the few Greater Elysium Core Realm experts shocked with fear flashing in the depths of their pupils. After all, Qin Cang was so strong that not even they could see through him.

“This is the Blackwater Serpent King. Its bloodline is still somewhat pure, so everyone can split it up and refine it,” said Qin Cang as he placed his hands behind him. His words immediately made all the Profound Sky Sect’s experts rejoice. When they looked at Qin Cang, their eyes were filled with reverence.

“Senior Brother, there’s a saint elixir up ahead!” There were disciples who yelled out in excitement as they scouted forth after the death of the black serpent.

“Obtain it and hand it over to the sect. In the future when you guys become core disciples, you guys can apply for it from the sect.” Qin Cang said indifferently, showing no interest in the saint elixir.

After reaching his level, the cultivation and foundation were no longer important. He had already refined all the required saint elixirs when he was in the quasi-Elysium Core Realm. Now, he just needed a deeper accumulation so that he could make it high on the Elysium Core Ranking. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He wanted to create a legend, sweeping through the Elysium Core Ranking at the Lesser Elysium Core Realm and become the first ranker on the Elysium Core Ranking. The person he respected the most was Jian Jingtian, who was first on the three rankings. So this was also his objective, he also wanted to be first on the three rankings.

That legend shouldn’t just belong to the Sword Sect. The Profound Sky Sect should also have such an achievement. But now, Qin Cang was somewhat vexed because there were 108 mountains, and he had no idea how long he would have to search to find the Great Saint Origin.

Compared to the Great Saint Origin, the saint elixirs were nothing in comparison. Most importantly, he knew that he couldn’t stay in this place for long because he had long sensed his vitality being slowly sapped away from his body.

After a brief hesitation, Qin Cang finally made up his mind and yelled, “Spread out my orders!”
