Chapter 1082 - The One Who Buries Flower (2)

The Imperial Feather Realm Son felt a huge blow to his ego after watching Lin Yun. So it turned out that Lin Yun was telling the truth. If he wanted, he could have easily defeated the Imperial Feather Realm Son.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son didn’t believe it at first, but reality was cruel. At this moment, he could feel his confidence and vitality disappear even faster.

The crowd was still shocked by the events that unfolded. The Imperial Feather Realm Son had his heart dug out, the Imperial Diagram Realm Son died, and the five Realm Sons lost their vision from the dazzling brilliance. All of this was caused by Lin Yun and Lin Yun alone. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He was an absolute nobody from the Profound Amber Realm. But he still managed to deal with three war realms in Wind Mound City and deal with the Realm Sons in the final battle.

“Haha. The champion should be Lin Yun now, right?” The elder of the Thunder Sect who was optimistic about Lin Yun earlier smiled. The current situation wasn’t hard to deal with. If Lin Yun was willing to join the Thunder Sect, he could end things right now. After all, the Thunder Sect had an unimaginable foundation in the Ancient Barren Domain that even the saint clans couldn’t be compared to.

If Lin Yun became the Thunder Sect’s core disciple, it wouldn’t matter if he killed all ten Realm Sons. The war realms wouldn’t even dare to utter a single word.

However, the elder knew that Lin Yun’s cultivation was a problem. After all, Lin Yun was only in the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. It was a huge risk to defend Lin Yun since everything was based on his potential, not current strength. It would have been easier if Lin Yun was from a war realm because no one would hesitate to take him in.

“The final battle has more or less come to an end. Lin Yun is extremely suitable for my Flying Snow Manor…” smiled another elder. All of the elders were hesitant until the Thunder Sect spoke up. No one could afford to lose out on a genius who swept through five Realm Sons.

They could tell that Lin Yun would be extraordinary in the future the moment he arrived in Kunlun Realm. It would be like a dragon returning to sea.

“The floral fragrance still hasn’t dissipated, so it’s too early to talk about that,” snorted the Profound Sky Sect’s Elder Jin Jue. The other elders knew that Elder Jin Jue had a deep relationship with the Nether Divinity War Realm, so none of them uttered a word.

The Profound Sky Sect might be an overlord among the various sects, but the Heavenly Path was managed by the Sacred Alliance, not the various sects. So there was nothing Elder Jin Jue could do to Lin Yun even if he wanted to kill him right now. The Profound Sky Sect might be an overlord, but they weren't powerful enough to rule over the various sects.

Looking at everyone else, Elder Jin Jue wore a playful expression and sneered, “A moment of victory is nothing. That brat doesn’t have enough to have the last laugh!”

When the other elders heard that, they became confused. Elder Jin Jue sounded pretty confident, so they weren’t sure what they weren’t seeing. After all, Lin Yun had already swept through the Realm Sons. Was Elder Jin Jue that confident in the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s group that disappeared?

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning streaked across the horizon and lit up the entire Saint Spiritual Lake. As more lightning began to gather, Demonic Astral Flowers also descended from the sky.

Just like that, the Demonic Astral Flowers entered the Saint Spiritual Lake and sank to the bottom of the lake. The crowd was shocked because someone was clearly undergoing a tribulation.

“Someone’s undergoing the seventh soul tribulation!” The seventh soul tribulation was the last tribulation in the Heavenly Soul Realm. Apparently, someone had reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. The crowd panicked when they realized this and immediately left the Saint Spiritual Lake. The only person who stayed was Lin Yun.

With countless gazes on Lin Yun, the crowd started to realize that there was only one group that could be causing the commotion. It turned out that the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s party hadn’t left the game, but were actually in hiding to strike back.

It was publicly known that the seventh soul’s tribulation was dangerous. The fact that the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s party underwent their tribulation in the lake meant that they had obtained a great opportunity down there.

Beautiful and bewitching Demonic Astral Flowers dropped from the clouds and enveloped the entire Saint Spiritual Lake. They gave great pressure to those who were standing by.

At the same time, everyone could sense three terrifying auras at the bottom of the lake that were growing more powerful with every second.

The elders who were watching suddenly exclaimed, “The floral fragrance at the bottom of the lake is filled with impurities!”

“I told you, there’s no way that brat will become the champion. It’s good enough if he can survive,” sneered Elder Jin Jue indifferently.

Listening to his words, the other elders knew that Lin Yun was doomed. Even if Lin Yun was strong, they didn’t think that he could face three Realm Sons in the seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

“Hahaha!” A familiar laughter sounded out from the bottom of the lake. Naturally, it belonged to the Nether Divinity Realm Son who wanted to cleanse himself of the humiliation he suffered from Lin Yun.

“Lin Yun, come and die!” Three figures shot out of the lake as they roared at Lin Yun. The Nether Divinity, Profound Dragon, and Elysium Trigram Realm Sons were emitting a terrifying aura in the seventh soul. Many people’s faces were changing because their auras weren’t as strong as they thought it would be. It seemed like their auras were chaotic like they made a breakthrough in a hurry.

But they were still in the seventh soul since they established a seven aura ocean. Even the holy spirits that were behind them seemed to get a boost in power.

But once they shot out of the lake, the entire Saint Spiritual Lake began to rumble. A terrifying sword intent was stirring the lake, creating a gigantic vortex in the middle. In the next second, a sword shot out of the lake that overwhelmed the luster of the three Realm Sons.

Furthermore, the boundless sword ray filled every corner of the region. It was as if the region was on lockdown. The crowd couldn’t believe their eyes. Lin Yun’s sword was so breathtaking that it exceeded the radiance of a mere dao artifact.

Lin Yun slowly grabbed his sword, which gave the crowd heartache. Although it wasn’t their sword, they felt like Lin Yun had stolen their beloved treasure.

When Lin Yun held onto the sword, he threw a glance at the three Realm Sons. He rushed over to them before they could even make a move.

“My sword and I have been waiting a long time!” Lin Yun looked down at the three Realm Sons when he spoke. In the next second, the Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans began to blaze while he unleashed a terrifying sword ray that painted the sky with a rainbow color.

The Realm Sons didn’t hesitate to exhaust their origin energy and vitality to fend off Lin Yun’s attack. However, Lin Yun’s attack was too strong. When the sword ray descended, the three Realm Sons disappeared, leaving behind no traces of their bodies.
