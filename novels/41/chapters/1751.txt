Chapter 1752 – Bad Intentions (2)

Yan Tianchen’s gaze was blazing with flames because this was really spectacular. But it was a pity Lin Yun wasn’t around. If Lin Yun was around, they could verify if it was true. Yan Tianchen, Liu Ruochen, and Ye Chen already knew each other long ago, and their relationship became closer through Lin Yun.

“Ha. Don’t tell me you think you can make the Three-Lives Tree reflect your past, present, and future.” Zhang Ying of the Divine Dao Pavilion snickered.

“Who knows? Perhaps that’s what he really has in mind…” Chen Jun of the Myriad Lightning Sect smiled.

They lost terribly to Lin Yun yesterday. Since Lin Yun wasn’t around today, they naturally wouldn’t be polite with Yan Tianchen. But the latter merely turned to glance at them with a smile.

Amongst the top ten, Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei weren’t around. As for Li Yuxi, he was thoroughly humiliated and left the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion because of that. Thus, there were only seven of the top ten here.

As for the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion and the audience, they were seated on a ship. Just when he was about to speak, Jiang Yingtian flew over and whispered in his ears. Hearing what his son said, the pavilion master lowered his cup and commented, “They really came? This really isn’t the right time.”

His words made everyone baffled. Just when everyone was confused, celestial music resounded, and a group of people floated over. There was a man and nine women. The man was enveloped in an extraordinary temperament, while the women were dressed in white.

The faces of those chatting before the Three-Lives Tree suddenly changed with shock in their eyes. The nine women were holding onto a musical instrument each. There was a jade flute, a bamboo flute, a lute, and various other instruments. They were all playing an extraordinary ancient song. Their melody exploded in the air and scattered in the form of starlight.

When the starlight scattered, it formed a bizarre phenomenon that shocked many people. Under this phenomenon, the blue-robed youth slowly descended from the sky.

“Someone from the Ten Musical Clans!”

“That’s the Saint Hands, Mei Zihua!” Everyone here was a holy land genius. So they naturally heard about the Ten Musical Clans, and they could instantly recognize this person’s origin from his clothes. This immediately placed everyone under tremendous pressure and wore grave expressions. This was because they never expected someone from the Ten Musical Clans to be here.

From ten miles away, Mei Zihua cupped his hands at the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master before heading towards the Three-Lives Tree with the nine women following behind him. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When they walked forth, everyone was pushed aside by an invisible energy that opened a path before them. Without any expression, Mei Zihua walked forth. But he fell into deep thoughts when his gaze fell onto the Three-Lives Tree. He only had the Three-Lives Tree in his eyes and no one else.

After Jiang Yingtian flew down from the ship, he looked at Mei Zihua, “Young Master Mei, you’re a little late.”

“I wasn’t feeling comfortable.” Mei Zihua turned to look at Jiang Yingtian and said in a somewhat apologetic tone.

“Why did I hear that Young Master Mei already arrived in Heavenly Domain City seven days ago? The Nirvana Banquet has already ended. So according to the rules, Young Master Mei has no qualification to play before the Three-Lives Tree.” Jiang Yingtian raised his brow. His attitude represented the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion.

Everyone was inwardly alarmed when they heard Mei Zihua had long arrived. So what did he mean by arriving now?

Mei Zihua smiled, but he didn’t reply. One of his maids stepped forth and pridefully said, “Young Pavilion Master, there’s no need to continue holding the Nirvana Banquet since you’ve invited our young master. Can anyone in this world be more proficient in music dao than the Ten Musical Clans? Wanting our young master to compete with others is no different from looking down on our young master.”

Even a maid is so arrogant? Zhang Ying, Chen Jun, Qin Hao, and Hua Hongyu’s faces became ugly when they heard that. Even if Mei Zihua was from one of the Ten Musical Clans, was there a need for him to be so arrogant?

Jiang Yingtian furrowed his brows before he snickered, “According to your words, doesn’t that mean we can just let your young master become first on the Nirvana Banquet without holding it?”

The maid still wanted to say something, but Mei Zihua stopped her with a wave. Then, Mei Zihua said, “The first of this Nirvana Banquet is Li Yuxi, right? I’ll just have to defeat him, then.”

“I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed, but he’s not first on the Nirvana Banquet.” Jiang Yingtian said indifferently.

“Oh?” Mei Zihua was stunned before saying, “I’m not interested in who’s first. I only want his Three-Lives Fruit. As for the top ten? Me and my nine maids, there are ten of us.”

His words immediately caused public outrage on the Dual Moon Lake because Mei Zihua was too arrogant, even more than Lin Xiao.

“Mei Zihua, aren’t you a little too arrogant? Not only do you want the Three-Lives Fruit, but you want the top ten rankings?” Zhang Ying said coldly.

“Do you know even music?” Mei Zihua asked indifferently.

Zhang Ying’s face became red when he heard that. He was someone who grasped the Saint Tone. But Mei Zihua actually said he didn’t understand any music.

“Since you don’t know music, what do you need the rankings for? It’s a waste even if you can play before the Three-Lives Tree.” Mei Zihua said, looking at the ancient tree.

“Mei Zihua, don’t push it!” Zhang Ying flew into a rage.

But Mei Zihua didn’t bother about him and merely pointed with his finger, “Lu Qing, you teach him what music is.”

“Yes, Young Master.” A white-dressed woman stepped forth with her flute. She looked at Zhang Ying and said, “Sorry about that.”

When the woman played her flute, soundwaves spread out in the form of a majestic aura, and it was hard to imagine a woman actually played it. Everyone quickly retreated, and Zhang Ying’s face also changed when he saw this scene and took out his flute to retaliate.

As two flute melodies resounded, the two melodies manifested into various phenomena on the lake. The outcome also surpassed their expectations because it didn’t take long for Zhang Ying to be defeated. When Zhang Ying's melody became a mess, he threw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away.

Chen Jun quickly stepped forth to support Zhang Ying. But Zhang Ying was shocked as he looked at the white-dressed lady, “The Divine Snow Plum Touch!”

That was a finger technique of one of the Ten Musical Clans, and it had an ancient inheritance, containing the ancient rhythm of snow plums. This finger technique came from a musical powerhouse.

This also caused an uproar on the Dual Moon Lake because Mei Zihua merely sent out a maid to defeat Zhang Ying.

This made Yan Tianchen furrow his brows, and he felt Mei Zihua didn’t come with good intentions.
