Chapter 2433 - I Have A Sword, Please Give Some Advice

Everyone’s cheers echoed with Tian Xuanzi as they headed towards the Sword Sect. Saints were fast and already a thousand miles away from the Sword Sect when the sun reached the sky.

Tian Xuanzi sat on the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne with the three holy lands’ sect masters and Black Mountain’s Seven Saints beside him. Behind them were the Great Saints, Saint Sovereigns, and Saints from the various forces, not to mention countless Quasi-Saints. It was hard for Quasi-Saints to join the battle between Saints, and they could only cheer to increase their morale.

It was hard to see a Saint before the Blue Dragon Record. But after the Blue Dragon Record, the spiritual energy in the world became dense, and Saints began to appear in public, and Saints were no longer rarely seen. Even so, it was rare to see so many Saints together.

“Isn’t this too unfathomable?”

“I didn’t expect there to be so many Saints even after sensing their aura earlier.”

“Even an Emperor would have a tough time dealing with so many people, right?”

“Emperors can easily kill ordinary Saints, but there are too many experts amongst the Profound Sky Sect’s party. Which one of the Black Mountain’s Seven Saints isn’t at the pinnacle of Great Saints?”

“I heard that the Heavenly Sever Great Saint once exchanged ten moves with an Emperor and survived, thus becoming the leader of Black Mountain. As for the three holy lands’ sect masters, there was naturally nothing to say about them.”

“Don’t forget about Tian Xuanzi! He’s known to be the strongest beneath the Emperor Realm. Aside from the Nine Emperors, ordinary Emperors might not be able to do anything to him, not to mention his Sovereign Artifacts.”

“That’s the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne, right? Tian Xuanzi looks dashing.” Everyone was shocked when they saw the Profound Sky Sect’s formation, especially Tian Xuanzi, who sat on the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne. He looked like a dazzling bright sun, and it was hard for anyone not to take notice of him.

Everyone knew this battle would be brutal, and they would be caught up in it if they weren’t careful. But this battle attracted too much attention. Not only cultivators from the Eastern Desolation, there were even cultivators from the other regions watching this battle.

This was going to be the biggest battle since the Nine Emperors ended the Dark Era, and this battle might even escalate to the Emperors. The Eastern Desolation had long become the center of the turbulence. With such a huge formation from the Profound Sky Sect, the Sword Sect must’ve noticed it, but they had no fear.

“Where’s Mu Xuankong? Does he dare to come out of the Sword Sect?” Tian Xuanzi’s voice echoed from the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne, spreading out. When his voice reached the Sword Sect, a barrier appeared with visible ripples that could be seen. But Tian Xuanzi’s voice still managed to pass through the barrier, causing the hundred-and-eight peaks to tremble.

Very quickly, sword rays bloomed from the hundred-and-eight peaks, with sword intent spreading out to stabilize the peaks. Mu Xuankong didn’t want to waste his saliva with Tian Xuanzi, so he roared from the Scarlet Firmament Peak, “You ungrateful bastard. Come if you want. Don’t think that there’s no one in the Sword Sect!”

“Mu Xuankong, I will spare your lives if you’re willing to dismiss the Great Profound Sword Array. But it looks like the entire Sword Sect can die with the Radiant Sword Saint now,” Tian Xuanzi sneered from the throne. He continued, “All Saint Lords, make a move and test this legendary array that can even stop Emperors.”

“Roger that!” Under Tian Xuanzi’s orders, five hundred Saint Lords spread out, summoning their constellations with their dao flowers blooming and their powerful auras, shattering the thirty-six layers of heaven.

When starlight shone down, the starlight enveloped the Saint Lords as they attacked the Sword Sect. This was shocking since their attacks even caused space to distort before raining down. Each Saint Lord mastered a different martial technique, and their attacks created countless phenomena. Just one attack was normally enough to destroy an entire mountain.

Their attacks were like fireballs raining down on the Sword Sect’s barrier, causing explosions. But they failed to destroy the Sword Sect’s barrier, only causing ripples to spread out.

On the Scarlet Firmament Peak, Mu Xuankong stood with the Divine Phoenix Holy Master and Azure Phython Great Saint by his sides, as well as other Saints. The Azure Python Great Saint asked, “How long can this barrier stop the attacks?”

“If the attacks don’t stop, it can last three days. But if Tian Xuanzi possesses other means, I’m afraid it’ll be hard to stop him since the Great Profound Sword Array isn’t complete, to begin with,” Mu Xuankong said. He turned around and said, “I’ll have to trouble the holy master later to stop Tian Xuanzi.”

Tian Xuanzi was stronger than ordinary Great Saints, and they would take a devastating blow if they allowed Tian Xuanzi to attack the Sword Sect. Thus, the Divine Phoenix Holy Master had to stop Tian Xuanzi no matter what.

“I understand,” the Divine Phoenix Holy Master nodded. After reaching his level, he could easily suppress ordinary Great Saints if he didn’t run into Emperors. So if no one stopped Tian Xuanzi and allowed him to do what he wanted, the Sword Sect wouldn’t be able to last long.

From the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne, Tian Xuanzi smiled, “All Saint Sovereigns, use your Glory Saint Artifacts and attack! Don’t hold back!”

Forty-odd Saint Sovereigns spread out, unleashing their auras that caused heaven and earth to tremble violently. The Saint Sovereigns took out Sevenspirit Glory Saint Artifacts and unleashed forty-odd attacks at the Great Profound Sword Array. Fine cracks appeared on the barrier this time, with the entire Sword Sect trembling.

But Mu Xuankong was calm as he raised his sword to the sky. A boundless energy gushed from the various peaks and gathered on the Scarlet Firmament Peak, causing Mu Xuankong’s aura to rise. When the sword ray spread out, all the incoming attacks shattered.

Seeing this, Tian Xuanzi ordered the Great Saints to move, aside from Light Subduing Great Saint and Heavenly Sever Great Saint. When all the Great Saints made their moves, each attack was devastating, with cracks appearing in the surroundings. The landscape around the Sword Sect was decimated by their attacks.

“As long as the moon exists, Sword Sect never dies!” Mu Xuankong roared as all the disciples stationed at the hundred-and-eight peaks echoed with him.

“As long as the moon exists, Sword Sect never dies!” Ye Ziling formed a seal, and she roared, “Sword!”

Her sword flew to the sky before more swords flew up as well. When all the swords flew to the sky, Mu Xuankong formed a seal and created a bright moon, releasing a dazzling radiance.

Mu Xuankong controlled the swords through the Great Profound Sword Canon and swung his sword, unleashing a massive sword ray that flew from the bright moon, resolving the attacks from the twenty-two Great Saints. But the sword ray didn’t stop there, it continued to fly at the Great Saints, forcing them to either dodge or retaliate.

This scared everyone watching from afar because Mu Xuankong could face twenty-odd Great Saints using the power of the Great Profound Sword Array, which was unbelievable. Anyone who could become a Great Saint wasn’t a pushover; this scene didn’t intimidate them. They merely sneered before they charged forth.

The Flame Crow Great Saint and Heavenly Glory Great Saint led the Great Saints. As sect masters, they were naturally stronger than ordinary Great Saints. They charged forth and blocked Mu Xuankong’s sword aura while the other Great Saints harassed from the surroundings.

This might be their first time joining hands, but they were all experienced in fighting and had a strong rapport. The Ancient Key Great Saint was a heavenly spiritualist, and he drew saint runes in the surroundings with his attention focused on the Great Profound Sword Array.

Mu Xuankong’s eyes became golden, a sign of his Divine Light Sword Intent reaching the pinnacle. His sword intent was much stronger than Lin Yun’s. Relying on the Great Profound Sword Array and the support of Sword Sect’s disciples, he held his ground against twenty-two Great Saints.

Thousands of sword rays shot out from the moon to attack those Great Saints responsible for harassing the array. The Great Profound Sword Array was powerful, but the Flame Crow Great Saint and Heavenly Glory Great Saint weren’t weak. One of them released his Great Solar Domain with a Sovereign Artifact in his hand, performing the Starshattering Blade Art of the Heavenly Flame Sect. The other was even more terrifying. He used a flag engraved with divine runes, and lightning would flash in the sky whenever he waved the flag.

Seated on the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne, Tian Xuanzi looked at this with interest. There was no panic on his face. The Ming Cult’s Light Subduing Great Saint said, “As the holy master has expected. Twenty-odd Great Saints have failed to break apart the Great Profound Sword Array.”

The Heavenly Sever Great Saint coldly said, “But this barrier can’t withstand the endless attacks of Great Saints, and Mu Xuankong had to move to barely obtain a balance.”

With the Great Saints taking the lead, the Saint Sovereigns and Saint Lords continued to attack the barrier, but the effects weren’t high.

Tian Xuanzi sneered, “I heard that this array can even withstand the attack of an Emperor, but it looks like it was an exaggeration. This array is incomplete. Let Ancient Key Great Saint make a move. There’s no meaning for this to continue.”

The Heavenly Sever Great Saint nodded and sent his voice over. When the Ancient Key Great Saint received the message, he revealed an eerie smile and seventy-two flags appeared behind him. With a flick of his finger, the flags were like spears as they pierced through the barrier and descended toward the various peaks.

“Not good!” The Divine Phoenix Holy Master and Azure Python Great Saint’s faces changed, wanting to make a move to stop the flags. But when the flags pierced through the barrier, they exploded and saint runes flew out, forming a massive diagram. But the massive diagram only lasted for a brief moment before the Sword Sect destroyed it.

Then again, this delay was enough for the Ancient Key Great Saint. Two dragons flew out of his sleeves when he clasped his hands together, flying at the bright moon. The two dragons formed into scissors, like a Heavenly Dog biting at the moon when they intertwined.

When the Sword Sect destroyed the diagram, a huge hole appeared on the bright moon, and the hole began to expand due to the scissors.

“The Dragon Slaughter Scissors!”

“That’s the Dragon Slaughter Scissors of the Divine Dao Pavilion!” The faces of everyone who came to observe changed.

Tian Xuanzi smiled from the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne, before he roared, “I’m the sovereign! Azure Dragon, heed my order!”

Cracks appeared from the thirty-six layers of heaven as Tian Xuanzi pushed his palm down. The Eternal Constellation, the Azure Dragon Constellation, awakened as a massive dragon claw descended from the sky, enveloping the entire Sword Sect.

This scene made many people despair, and Mu Xuankong’s face changed when he saw this scene. He roared, “Sword!”

All the swordsmen in the various peaks soared to the sky with their swords, wanting to stop the Azure Dragon’s claw under Mu Xuankong’s control. This was a shocking scene because all the swords in the Sword Sect were mobilized, including all the disciples, deacons, and elders, pouring their sword intent into their swords.

The swords formed a pillar that shot to the sky, and this scene looked like it could prevent the entire sky from falling. But the result was disappointing since the Great Profound Sword Array was incomplete, to begin with. Not to mention that the Dragon Slaughter Scissors had further damaged it.

When the dragon's claw and sword ray clashed, sparks flew from the dragon’s claw, and all the swords shattered. Many of Sword Sect’s disciples suffered a backlash and threw out blood with their knees on the ground. Ultimately, the barrier couldn’t withstand the dragon’s claw, and many disciples were sent flying away. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

When Tian Xuanzi returned to the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne, he smiled viciously at this scene.

“The Profound Sky Great Saint, invincible in the Ancient Barren!”

““The Profound Sky Great Saint, invincible in the Ancient Barren!””

Someone cheered as roars came from the Profound Sky Sect, looking at the entire mountain about to be suppressed by the dragon’s claw.

But a sword ray flew to the sky and pierced through the dragon’s claw. It came from the Divine Phoenix Holy Master, who was hovering in the sky with a sword.

“Profound Sky Great Saint, I also have a move for you.” The Divine Phoenix Holy Master smiled. His sword aura was even more terrifying than Mu Xuankong’s. With a sword in his hand, he said, “This sword is called the Listening Wind Chime.”

When the Divine Phoenix Holy Master swung his sword, the faces of the Great Saints attacking the Sword Sect changed, and they quickly retreated. But the sword ray flew and everyone could hear a violent wind howl in the form of a dragon’s roar.
