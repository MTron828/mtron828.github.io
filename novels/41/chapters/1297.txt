Chapter 1298 - Waited A Long Time For This Day!

Lin Yun’s words made the white-haired youth surprised because he was also a prideful person. He smiled and said, “Interesting…”

He didn’t hesitate to draw his sword, unleashing a blade ray, and the blade vibration was comparable to a draconic roar. His attacks were so fast that they looked like blurred smudges to Lin Yun. Thirty-six figures appeared before him, a total of thirty-six blade trajectories that came at Lin Yun, and the intent behind each blade was different.

He couldn’t differentiate which one was real and which one was fake. But he soon recovered from his shock because every single one of those trajectories was real. There might only be one blade, but the intents have manifested into different forms, and he would be struck if he wasn’t careful.

But since he couldn’t see through the attacks, he might as well give up and see who was faster. Drawing the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun also unleashed thirty-six swords in the blink of an eye. When the blade and sword collided, sparks flew around, and they were both surprised after their clash.

Both of their foreheads lit up as they began to accumulate their sword and blade auras. Right at that moment, pieces of rocks began to fall from the roof, and the entire place was tottering on the verge of collapse.

Looking at this scene, Lin Yun instantly figured out what was going on. After all, the transcendents of the three sects destroyed the altar on the first level. Even if the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts were supporting the entire structure, they were also reaching their limit and the entire underground palace would collapse soon.

“Is this what you want?” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the altar. In her hand was a pendant, and there was a crimson flower on the pendant. The pendant should have been on the quasi-saint, which Lil’ Red took before it landed in Lil’ Purple’s hand.

This scene made the white-haired youth raise his brow and his gaze was directed over. Looking at Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red beside her, the white-haired youth turned to look at Lin Yun. “Give it to me and I’ll leave.”

Lin Yun was surprised when he heard that because he didn’t expect that this white-haired youth didn’t come for the quasi-saint origin. So they might be able to form a truce between them since Lin Yun wasn’t confident of defeating this white-haired youth, not to mention that the latter didn’t manifest his constellation.

But Lil’ Purple didn’t think that way and said, “Hand the Dragon Saint Pellet over and this empress can give it a consideration.”

When Lin Yun heard that, he finally figured out why the Dragon Saint Pellet was missing on the second altar. No wonder he couldn’t find it when he had already sensed the Dragon Saint Pellet’s aura. After all, Lin Yun was depressed when he couldn’t find it back then.

The white-haired youth’s eyes flickered before he said, “I can exchange it with you using the saint elixir.”

“Oh?” Lil’ Purple smiled. “This empress nearly forgot about that. The saint elixir born on the Sword Sect’s island was taken by you. Good, hand the Dragon Saint Pellet and saint elixir over for this pendant.”

Her words left the white-haired youth stumped because he didn’t think that her appetite was so huge. She was clearly just a brat, but she kept calling herself ‘Empress’.

“It’s best for you not to be too greedy.” The white-haired youth’s forehead began to shine with bright light accompanied by a destructive aura.

When Lin Yun noticed this, he fell into deep thoughts because this was similar to his firmament sword intent. Could it be the firmament blade intent? He said, “Empress, let’s not make things difficult for him. Just the Dragon Saint Pellet will do.”

“Deal.” The white-haired youth replied before tossing a silver jade bottle over. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

When Lin Yun held onto it, the jade bottle was heavy, and he could also sense a faint true dragon aura emitting from the bottle. Seeing that the white-haired youth was so straightforward, Lin Yun instantly figured out that this youth was putting on an act earlier. He didn’t need the Dragon Saint Pellet or the quasi-saint origin but the pendant. So he instantly realized that he had suffered a huge loss.

Lil’ Purple first glared at Lin Yun before she reluctantly handed the pendant over.

When the white-haired youth took the pendant, he revealed a gentle expression, and looked at Lin Yun. “My name is Xiao Fan, and I owe you one.”

“Lin Yun,” replied Lin Yun.

“Let’s go. This place will collapse soon, and you have to be quick if you want the quasi-saint origin,” said the white-haired youth before he swiftly left after giving the altar a bow.

Lin Yun could sense a unique and mysterious temperament from him that not even the transcendent geniuses possessed.

“You know him?” Lin Yun asked Lil’ Purple.

“I roughly recognize his origin. I never expected that that clan still has descendants after so many years. Let’s not talk about that and store the quasi-saint origin first. The three sects will be arriving soon,” replied Lil’ Purple while nodding her head.

Lin Yun agreed with her because those people were really troublesome. At the same time, he knew that it wouldn’t be easy for him to leave after retrieving the quasi-saint origin. Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun gave three bows to the quasi-saint corpse before he approached it. “Senior, sorry about this.”

Just when he was about to approach, the quasi-saint corpse’s face suddenly became sinister with a terrifying silver demonic light surging in its pupils. But the purple mark on Lin Yun’s forehead shone as he used his firmament sword intent to resist the demonic aura.

As he got closer to it, all sorts of negative emotions poured into his mind, constantly trying to corrode it. If it was him in the past, Lin Yun would probably have a headache facing it. But he had undergone countless massacres in the Nine Li Illusion Realm, so his heart was a lot firmer than before. Even if it was a saint, it was impossible for Lin Yun’s heart to waver, and this meant that Lin Yun wouldn’t fall to the demonic path.

I don’t regret killing anyone with my sword! Lin Yun inwardly snorted before he placed his palm on the quasi-saint corpse’s chest. As countless amounts of black miasma poured from the corpse, the demonic aura surged towards Lin Yun but they were all erased by a sword ray before they could even get close.

When the demonic miasma was dispelled, the quasi-saint corpse was also reduced to ashes. At the same time, Lin Yun could hear an elderly voice by his ears, “Thank you for that, young lad.”

Shortly after, a sacred lump of light appeared before Lin Yun, containing unimaginable power. The pressure alone nearly made Lin Yun fall to his knees. But Lin Yun resisted the pressure with his firmament sword intent and grasped the quasi-saint origin with great difficulty.

“Just the quasi-saint origin is already so terrifying…” Lin Yun let out a breath after the pressure disappeared. While wiping the sweat on his forehead, Lin Yun felt as though he had passed by the gates of death. He could feel that if it wasn’t for the old man’s words earlier, he might have even be killed by the quasi-saint origin.

When Lin Yun grasped the quasi-saint origin, it instantly calmed down, as though it had acknowledged him. As the surrounding space began to tremble, the quasi-saint origin swiftly shrunk in size before it ultimately formed into a white crystal.

The heart of the crystal was imprinted with crimson flames that were so dazzling that Lin Yun had to cover his eyes with his hands or he would be hurt by it. When he held onto the quasi-saint origin, he still couldn’t believe it. “I got it so easily?”

With the quasi-saint origin, he could catch up to the foundation of those transcendent geniuses when he reached the Elysium Core Realm. After all, he had only been in the Kunlun Realm for a year while those transcendent geniuses have spent years in the Empyrean Realm. But with the quasi-saint origin, he could quickly catch up to them, and he could also comprehend the martial dao that only quasi-saints could comprehend.

“How is it? If it’s not for me, you’d still be trapped on the second level…” Lil’ Purple proudly said.

Stowing the quasi-saint origin, Lin Yun didn’t refute those words because he knew that he would be trapped in the underground palace if it wasn’t for her help, not to mention that she had also indirectly helped him deal with the white-haired youth.

Right at that moment, the entire underground palace began to tremble even more violently and even the altar he was standing on began to sway. When he looked down, he could see an astronomical sum of Divine Astral Pellets in the deep crater. This was probably for the quasi-saint when he was alive to try and make a breakthrough to the Saint Realm.

He had no idea how many were left, but one or two million shouldn’t be a problem. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun raised his hand. “Rise!”

All the Divine Astral Pellets flew up from the bottom of the altar and he stowed them all away. At the same time, a smile rose on his face beneath the mask because he knew that he now had enough Divine Astral Pellets for his constellation, and he had waited a long time for this day!
