Chapter 1130 - The Moon Is Round Tonight!

There was still one day left until the full moon, and Lin Yun had been playing the flute for the past six days. He was trying to become proficient with the five sounds and 12 notes. The noble tune of music dao was a lot harder than he had imagined, and it wasn’t as easy as wielding the flute as a sword.

Thinking of the higher grades, Lin Yun felt like he couldn’t see the end of the road. Fortunately, he was blessed with good talent, so his comprehension of music dao wasn’t any weaker than the sword dao.

Although Lil’ Purple no longer had her cultivation, her attainment in music dao was still at the level of the divine dragon tune. So it was more than enough for her to guide Lin Yun. So Lin Yun made swift progress over the past six days. It was a speed that didn’t disappoint Lil’ Purple.

When Lin Yun played the flute, various phenomena began to appear in the surrounding ocean. He wasn’t playing a song and the flute wasn’t empowered by his sword intent. He merely relied on his own attainments in music dao and his origin energy to play the flute.

The music played over the ocean as sunlight and moonlight intertwined. Then, a sword ray soared into the sky past plum blossom trees. As the sword ray soared, a waterfall fell down. Finally, the sword ray exploded in the sky, manifesting a sea of flames that looked like blazing meteorites descending onto the ground.

The sky trembled with the blazing meteors like a crumbling mountain. With the music, Lin Yun displayed the five sounds of music. The sword rays represented gold, the plum blossom represented wood, the waterfall represented water, the meteorites represented fire, and the mountains represented the earth.

When the music gradually came to an end, a noble aura suddenly exploded out of Lin Yun that instantly erased all the phenomena. Geysers of water exploded on the ocean as water soared into the sky. Then, they transformed into water dragons that coiled around Lin Yun. This was the noble tune!

“Although you’re lacking a bit, your talent is terrifying. I can’t believe you grasped the noble tune within six days.” Lil’ Purple muttered with her brows locked. But she soon smiled because this meant that she had taught him well.

When Lin Yun lowered the flute, the water dragons turned into rain. He couldn’t conceal the joy in his eyes because the noble tune was roughly equivalent to sky sword intent. If he combined the noble tune with his sky sword intent at complete mastery, he would be extremely powerful.

But when Lin Yun tried to walk forward, he began to stagger. He had exhausted a great deal of mental energy over the past six days to grasp the noble tune.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun sat down and closed his eyes before he fell asleep. He had fallen into a deep sleep that lasted for an entire day and night. When he opened his eyes, his pupils were shining brightly with his spirit reaching an unprecedented height.

When Lin Yun got up, he stretched his waist before letting out a long yawn from the comfortable rest.

“Hmph, you yawned like that last night.” Lil’ Purple chuckled while she came over with Lil’ Red. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When Lin Yun heard that, he smiled awkwardly before he looked at the setting sun and squinted his eyes together, “The moon tonight should be gorgeous.”

“It hasn’t gone dark yet.” Lil’ Purple pouted.

Retracting his gaze, Lin Yun then turned to Lil’ Purple, “Heavenly Slaughter Emperor, I’ll be relying on you to leave the Demon Domain today.”

“Don’t worry about it. Even if I’m not at full strength, my divine runes aren’t something that ordinary people can resist,” said Lil’ Purple.

Killing Thunderclap Sword Demon wasn’t hard, so the challenge lay in leaving the Demon Domain. The Silver Moon Mask still wasn’t enough, and having Lil’ Purple was better than nothing even though she wasn’t too reliable yet.

“Let’s go then.” Lin Yun took in a deep breath before he turned to look in the Demon Domain’s direction. Just like that, they headed towards the Demon Domain that made disciples tremble in fear.

The Demon Domain was usually enveloped in a faint purple mist, and it was enveloped in eternal darkness. But on this night, the moon was casting a light on the Demon Domain.

Tonight was the full moon and the moon looked colossal. Sunlight couldn’t break through the gray mist, but moonlight could shine brightly in the Demon Domain.

Lin Yun was alone by himself without Lil’ Red or Lil’ Purple around him. He would occasionally draw gazes from the surroundings, but nothing happened because it wasn’t surprising for disciples from the sects to appear here. The Demon Domain wasn’t too different from other places except for the fact that it had a baleful aura in its atmosphere. Although this place was mainly occupied by demonic cultivators and demonic sects, it wasn’t surprising to see disciples from the sects.

“This is unlike my imagination,” said Lin Yun while he headed towards an inn. The inn was filled with various noises as many demonic cultivators were drinking and chatting. Occasionally, there would even be fights breaking out.

“Brother, your help please.” When Lin Yun came in, a corpse was next to his foot and the waiter of the inn quickly came over to clean up the mess. The waiter swiftly took the body away and even wiped the blood off the ground. However, no one was surprised by the dead person.

Right now, everyone was discussing the saint artifact that was being auctioned by the Heavenly Star Pavilion today.

“Hehe, Thunderclap Sword Demon is really formidable to snatch a saint artifact!”

“This fellow is extremely high profile and really managed to catch a big fish this time. How envious!”

“What is there to envy? He nearly died at the hands of Flower Burial. He doesn’t even dare to come out of the Heavenly Star Pavilion now!” Mentioning Flower Burial, the surrounding atmosphere suddenly became intense as demonic cultivators argued among themselves.

“I wonder where that bastard came from, killing dozens of demonic cultivators over the past month like a mad dog. Even Thunderclap Sword Demon nearly died this time.”

“If he’s really strong, then he should head to the Heavenly Star Pavilion to kill Thunderclap Sword Demon!”

Lin Yun raised his cup quietly. He didn’t think that he would be able to find the trace of Leng Aoran so easily, but it looked like the Heavenly Star pavilion wasn’t a pushover.

“I heard that the four major sects have sent their core disciples over to auction for the spear. After all, the Imperial Hook belonged to the King Suspend Palace’s Chu Tianhao!”

“ Thunderclap Sword Demon was heavily injured and he practically made himself an enemy with the four major sects. How could the four major sects let this opportunity go?”

“Hehe, but I’m afraid that they’ll be disappointed. After all, no one dares to make a move against the Heavenly Star Pavilion in the Demon Domain, not Chu Tianhao, not Ye Ziling…”

“No one can kill someone that the Heavenly Star Pavilion is protecting!” Everyone sounded pretty excited about the auction tonight. After all, saint artifacts were rarely seen, not to mention one that was being auctioned off as the personal saint artifact of Chu Tianhao. Furthermore, everyone was interested since this matter involved Flower Burial.

Lin Yun finished the wine in his cup before he left. He found Leng Aoran a lot faster than he expected. He finally realized why the demonic cultivators weren’t surprised by his arrival. After all, many disciples of the four major sects were also here.

An hour later, Lin Yun joined up with Lil’ Purple and told the latter what he found out. When Lil’ Purple heard that, her face became serious, “So the Heavenly Star Pavilion is actually that terrifying.. that makes sense. After all, that brat is so heavily injured, and he would need to find a place to hide and recover. I suggest that you give up.”

“I can’t. That old geezer from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect won’t accept any negotiations. I have to obtain the True Dragon Saint Liquid no matter what,” said Lin Yun calmly. This matter involved his breakthrough to the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, so he naturally couldn’t give up on it.

Tonight, Leng Aoran had to die no matter what, but only he knew if he was as calm as he looked. When he put the Silver Moon Mask on, his hair and clothes turned silver, “The moon is really round today. Since the array has already been set up, wait here for me.”

He then soared into the sky while Lil’ Purple watched him disappear into the silver moon.
