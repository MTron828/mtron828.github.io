Chapter 720 - Shameless!

The quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm expert wasn’t someone Lin Yun could contend with, not to mention the Profound Note Bell. No matter how anyone looked at this situation, there was no way Lin Yun could get out.

Lin Yun’s heart fluctuated with a cold expression. He had never encountered such a dire situation in his life. Although a Heavenly Soul Realm expert had attacked him in the past, it wasn’t a sure-death situation. But now, Chen Ziyu had sealed off all his paths of retreat with the help of the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm expert.

Lin Yun’s heart blazed with rage because he had underestimated how shameless these people were. It was laughable that he thought he could fight them fairly for the Divine Indigo Radiantstone back in the Death Auction.

Clearly, that woman wasn’t just petty, but she wanted him to die. His would only make her reputation grow even stronger. In the end, he would be a clown that assisted Qing Ruoyou’s reputation.

That bitch! Lin Yun cursed inwardly. He hardly cursed anyone, but he was truly enraged this time. Although he was prepared to die, he couldn’t accept dying such a grievous death!

“Do you guys dare to fight me fairly?” Lin Yun looked at the seven geniuses coldly. As a swordsman, he wasn’t afraid of death even if the seven geniuses ganged up on him. As long as he could display his own grace, he wouldn’t be filled with so much resentment.

“Do you guys dare to fight me?” Lin Yun barked once more, but no one responded to him. Chen Ziyu and the rest only looked at him with mocking gazes as if he was a clown. Their facial expressions clearly stated that Lin Yun wasn’t worthy.

Lin Yun snorted from rage as he unleashed his aura and sword intent. Along with a sword buzz and dragon roar, his aura tried to charge forward. But an invisible barrier constructed of ancient spiritual runes appeared.

Stomping his foot on the ground, Lin Yun charged forward like a ferocious beast. But he bounced off of the barrier every time and fine cracks appeared on his bones while the bell stood firm. Sensing the rage in Lin Yun, Lil’ Red let out a soft neigh with tears welling up in its eyes. Throwing a mouthful of blood, Lin Yun’s face was pale as he calmed down.

On the other hand, the seven geniuses were looking at him with mockery in their eyes. In their view, Lin Yun was a sword slave and he could only struggle bitterly before him. He wasn’t worthy of jumping around before them.

Looking at the old man, Lin Yun said coldly, “Thunder Prefecture’s Chen Clan isn’t any inferior to the seven overlord forces. But is the Chen Clan really so shameless to let an elder in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm act against me?”

His mockery was ear-piercing. After all, Lin Yun was only in the pinnacle Yang stage and he was only eighteen. On the other hand, the old man was someone in the Heavenly Soul Realm and it would be a joke if news of this got out.

But the old man didn’t have any changes on his face and smiled, “Don’t misunderstand. I never said that I would make a move against you. I just happened to pass by here with the bell.”

How shameless. Lin Yun now knew why they were a clan.

“Brother Chen, fulfill his wish. Let him know that there are people in Skymound City who can deal with him,” said Chu Muyan.

“I happen to have the same thoughts,” said Chen Ziyu as he was shrouded in a cold mist. He looked at Lin Yun, “Don’t think that you’re invincible because of your sword intent. Even someone like Nangong Wanyu is only in the top ten, not the top three. If I wasn’t afraid that the Demonification Fruit would be ruined, I would have killed you with a single move!”

As he spoke, he unleashed his aura in the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage. The other six from the seven geniuses were also surprised. They knew that Chen Ziyu was terrifying, but they never expected that he would be in the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage.

The Yin-Yang stage was the last stage in the Violet Palace Realm, categorized into the lesser, greater, and pinnacle mastery. Each category represented a great difference and each step was closer to the Heavenly Soul Realm. After reaching the Yin-Yang stage, it wouldn’t be easy to make a breakthrough.

Only monstrous geniuses could fight while crossing the stages. But Lin Yun could be considered an exception with his xiantian sword intent. In the entire Ancient Southern Domain, there weren’t many with a sword intent stronger than him, this included the older generation of swordsmen.

But even so, sword intent wasn’t invincible if the gap was too great. As for the gap between Lin Yun and Chen Ziyu, it was too great.

“Ziyu, you’re still injured!” The old man frowned. Chen Ziyu might be from the branch clan, but his talent could be ranked in the top three when including the main clan. Otherwise, the main clan wouldn’t allow Chen Ziyu to use the Profound Note Bell to suppress Lin Yun.

“It’s fine,” smiled Chen Ziyu as he unleashed a terrifying chill. Under his aura, his clothes emitted a faint jade luster.

“The frost intent!” The faces of Gu Yang and the others changed. They were already shocked that Chen Ziyu was in the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage, not to mention that he even grasped a martial intent. It was hard to comprehend a martial intent beneath the Heavenly Soul Realm, but anyone who could accomplish it was an absolute genius.

This was also the reason why sword intent wasn’t invincible in the Draconic Banquet as there were also other geniuses who had awakened their martial intent in the Violet Palace Realm. This was also the first time Gu Yang and the rest witnessed Chen Ziyu’s martial intent. This couldn’t help making them disappointed as it would be even harder for them to compete with Chen Ziyu in the future.

Gu Yang smiled, “Brother Chen, you’ve actually grasped the frost intent. You’ll definitely shine brightly in the Draconic Banquet.”

“Hehe, I was still worried for Brother Chen earlier. It looks like Brother Chen can crush this sword slave easily.”

“Haha, let Brother Chen kill this sword slave then.” Everyone’s words became more respectful as they have placed themselves in a lower position than Chen Ziyu. Even the old man controlling the Profound Note Bell couldn’t help feeling excited upon seeing this scene.

A crack appeared on the seal. The old man wasn’t afraid of Lin Yun escaping because he could control the Profound Note Bell full with his cultivation. As long as Lin Yun dared to move, he would teach Lin Yun a lesson on torture. When the spiritual runes separated out, Chen Ziyu entered the seal. He and Lin Yun were inside the Profound Note Bell and he wanted to suppress Lin Yun himself.

“I can kill you within three moves,” snorted Chen Ziyu coldly as he unleashed his frost intent in lesser mastery before sending his palm out.

Lin Yun grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword, unleashing the Azure Dragon Sword Aura in that split second to face Chen Ziyu’s palm head-on. After moving forward three steps, Lin Yun was unleashing a domineering aura.

The Flower Burial Sword shone brightly as Lin Yun faced Chen Ziyu’s attack head on. Simultaneously, the Iris Flower in his dantian also bloomed and his aura surged once more, suppressing Chen Ziyu’s aura completely.

When the two attacks clashed, cracks started to appear on Chen Ziyu’s palm. Chen Ziyu’s face changed drastically because he never expected that he would fail to suppress Lin Yun. After all, he even brought out his true cultivation and martial intent. Chen Ziyu hadn’t prepared properly, so he had to retreat.

“Die!” Lin Yun wanted to chase after Chen Ziyum but he heard a ringing in his ears that disrupted the flow of his origin energy. This made his body sway a little.

Chen Ziyu was briefly stunned at this scene. A moment later, he understood that the old man was helping him. With a smirk, he charged over and hit Lin Yun’s chest with his palm. This made Lin Yun throw up a mouthful of blood.

But before Lin Yun could even react, Chen Ziyu divided into countless afterimages and more palms landing on Lin Yun’s body. This caused Lin Yun to collide against the barrier and spit up even more blood.

“Brother Chen only used three moves to beat this sword slave like the dog he is.” Gu Yang and the rest knew that the old man was helping Chen Ziyu secretly, but none of them said anything about it and flattered him instead.

“It has already been three moves. Ziyu, come out and let me refine him to death.” The old man smiled sinisterly.
