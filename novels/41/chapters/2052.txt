Chapter 2053 - We'll Wait And See! (2)

The aura released from the bead was even stronger than the saint swords. But that wasn’t all as Zhao Hu swallowed the bead, and his aura immediately reached the height of a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase with his demon clan’s bloodline activated.

“Ye Qingtian is finished this time. After all, Ye Qingtian’s cultivation is weak.”

“The Black Plume Palace is despicable to use a foreign object as a swordsman. He’s trying to suppress Ye Qingtian by using his cultivation. This is no longer a battle between swordsmen!”

“How is Ye Qingtian going to fight now?”

Lin Yun could resist the pressure if he released his Astral Sword Intent. But Zhao Wuji was here, and Lin Yun didn’t want his trump cards to be revealed before the Sword Assembly. He swiftly made up his mind and took out a string of beads, the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads.

When Lin Yun poured his nirvana aura into the beads, the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads were activated, greatly alleviating Lin Yun's pressure. He held onto the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads with his left hand and the Flower Burial Sword with his right hand charged at Zhao Hu. Not only did his speed not decrease, but he was even faster than before.

“How is this possible?!” Zhao Hu’s eyes were filled with disbelief because he had already activated his demon clan’s bloodline through the bead, but Lin Yun still had such a fast speed.

“Myriad Swords Unite!” Lin Yun took a step forth and divided into thirteen figures. When all thirteen figures overlapped, the radiance released by Lin Yun’s sword technique was comparable to the sun and moon.

After Zhao Hu’s sword aura was torn apart, a sword was directed at his forehead. Zhao Hu managed to twist his body to avoid the incoming sword, but he still took a sword to his chest, creating a hole in his chest with blood gushing out. His injuries weren't light because of the blood gushing out from his wound.

Seeing this, Zhao Wuji gave a signal. Zhao Quan and Zhao Bao had swiftly received his signal.

“Ye Qingtian, don’t you try to harm my big brother!” The two sword servants dashed over, charging at Ye Qingtian, wanting to stop him from inflicting heavy injuries on Zhao Hu.

Lin Yun executed the Divine Sunchasing Art with ripples spreading out and easily avoided the two incoming attacks.

“Big Brother, are you fine?” Zhao Quan and Zhao Bao asked in concerned tones.

“I’m fine. We’ll go at him together and kill him!” Zhao Hu clutched his chest and sent a furious look at Ye Qingtian.

The three sword servants sent furious looks at Ye Qingtian as pairs of black wings unfolded behind them. They quickly charged towards Ye Qingtian, who had just regained his footing with a powerful aura sweeping out.

“Good!” Lin Yun smiled and jumped down from a table before sitting down. He released his grip on the Flower Burial Sword, and the sword flew out.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Lin Yun closed his eyes and injected his nirvana aura into the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads, then he began to fiddle with the beads. As Lin Yun fiddled with the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads, a holy light shone out with scriptures that could be seen.

The three sword servants were forced to retreat as the holy light and sword rays suppressed them. The Flower Burial Sword dashed forth while the Buddhist scripture made the baleful aura released from the three sword servants look like ghosts. This was because they brutally took too many lives, and their baleful auras became sin at this moment.

The three sword servants began to feel uneasy, and they could feel their souls trembling. Just like that, the Flower Burial Sword faced the three sword servants, and the three were panicking as they faced the incoming attacks.

“Multi-tasking! Dividing his heart into two!”

“Is that a Buddhist secret treasure?”

“Holy shit! Ye Qingtian has too many trump cards!” Everyone from the Eastern Desolation exclaimed at this scene because it was too unbelievable.

“Let’s end this game,” Lin Yun opened his eyes and tossed the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads over.

The Thunder Demon Subduing Beads manifested into a golden figure that was hundred feet in size, empowered by the scripture as it flew at the three swordsmen.

Lin Yun sat on the table and waved his hand to summon the Flower Burial Sword back to his hand.

On the other hand, Zhao Wuji had disappointment flashing across his pupils when he saw Ye Qingtian. He heard that Ye Qingtian had grasped the Astral Sword Intent, but he didn’t believe it without witnessing it with his own eyes. This was why he wanted to let his sword servants probe Ye Qingtian’s strength, but not only did he fail, his sword servants even humiliated him.

“I’m impressed you can divide your heart into two. Here’s a toast for you!” Zhao Wuji said as he tossed the cup over.

When the cup flew over, the surrounding space shattered. The boundless sword aura released from the cup made everyone from the Eastern Desolation retreat.

Lin Yun frowned and knew he couldn’t avoid this cup, or those behind him would be caught in the shockwave, including those from the Sword Sect. But Lin Yun was calm as he gently raised the Flower Burial Sword, executing the profundity of the Carefree 9 Swords’ Profound Sword Form, and sent the cup back. It looked as though Ye Qingtian had gently redirected a descending mountain in another direction.

The cup struck the three sword servants, riddling them with holes as they threw out mouthfuls of blood before the impact slammed them against the stone pillars.

Seeing this, Zhao Wuji’s face was dark as he said, “Ye Qingtian, how dare you!”

But Lin Yun was calm as he sheathed his sword and retrieved the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads. He said, “It depends on the person giving me a toast, and you’re not qualified.”

The surroundings fell into a dead silence, and no one dared to take a loud breath because they were nervous.

Not only was Zhao Wuji not angered by what Lin Yun said, he laughed instead, “Those who yell the loudest generally die the fastest. Based on the strength you have displayed so far, you won’t be able to have any performance at the Sword Assembly. At that time, you’ll know how laughable you are!”

“We’ll wait and see, then,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“We’ll wait and see!” Surprisingly, Zhao Wuji didn’t pursue Ye Qingtian and left with the three sword servants, along with Xiahou Yan’s corpse.

A long time later, after confirming that they had left, everyone from the Eastern Desolation heaved a sigh of relief. When they looked at Ye Qingtian again, their gazes were complicated. Ultimately, they had to rely on Ye Qingtian to protect the dignity of the Eastern Desolation, and those who mocked Ye Qingtian earlier began to feel awkward.
