Chapter 1757 – Heartbreak Song (1)

“What’s that?”

“Is that even a musical instrument?” Everyone was stumped when they looked at the erhu in Lin Yun’s hands because they had never seen such a bizarre musical instrument before.

Even Yan Tianchen was shocked and frowned, “That’s the spike fiddle?”

“Isn’t the spike fiddle long lost? No one knows any musical scores or how to play it.” Luo Shuyi was shocked, so was Lin Wan, who was beside her. Even Yue Weiwei couldn’t help being baffled when she saw this scene.

“The spike fiddle? Haha. Lin Yun, what are you trying to do here?” Mei Zihua shook his head with a smile. He was still looking forward to seeing how Lin Yun would respond or if he had any trump cards. The spike fiddle was long lost since ancient times, and no one could play it. Not to mention a musical score for it.

“Azure Saint Snow Lotus!” Mei Zihua smiled. When the Vermillion Bird soared to the sky with flames spreading out, the snow fell instead. Azure lotuses rose on the lake, and the melody was filled with ancient rhythm.

Just when Lin Yun was going to play the erhu, an azure lotus rose beneath him with a blazing aura spread out. This forced him to give up playing, and he quickly rose to the sky. As he flashed, he began to dodge the blooming azure lotuses.

Lin Yun didn’t take long to look pathetic, and Mei Zihua’s smile grew denser. His nine maids played their musical instruments behind him, making their songs even more concise. They practiced this often and had a strong rapport with it.

In addition to Mei Zihua’s melody, the floating lotuses looked alive. This made Lin Yun feel a chill and he noticed he was already covered in ice. His limbs were stiff, making it harder for him to exert energy. When another azure lotus bloomed, this caught Lin Yun by surprise and sent him flying away.

“Lin Xiao, it looks like you’re not fated with these nine beauties. If this is all you have, don’t resist and hand over the Three-Lives Fruit.” Mei Zihua smiled. He was arrogant, but anyone could tell he did not have an aloof attitude towards Lin Yun. He might sound arrogant, but his tone was more teasing, instead.

“It has come to an end here!” Mei Zihua smiled. Executing the Divine Snow Plum Touch, the thousand azure lotuses on the lake emitted a faint radiance. The Vermillion Bird breathed a mouthful of divine flames under the zither melody.

The thousand azure lotuses ignited at the same time, and this created a suffocating yet beautiful scenery. Everyone held their breath and could feel their scalps tingling because this was too terrifying. The melody played by Mei Zihua was too perfect, and they couldn’t imagine how strong his attainment in music dao was.

Just a moment ago, they all felt that Mei Zihua was shameless in joining hands with his nine maids to suppress Lin Yun even after losing the fight. But they had to admit that Mei Zihua was really a genius in music dao, and Imperial Tone was just a matter of time for him.

The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master was also shocked on the ship while looking at this scene; this included the elders. Was this really something played by a young man? Their mental cultivation was stronger than Mei Zihua's. They also knew how to play the Azure Saint Snow Lotus and could play it better than Mei Zihua. But they couldn’t play it so perfectly.

A sigh sounded beside Yue Weiwei and the others. When they turned around, they noticed that Mu Xueling had arrived without them realizing it. They quickly asked, “Saint Elder, can this song be broken?”

Mu Xueling gently shook her head and didn’t say a word. This made everyone’s expression dim, and Yue Weiwei was sad for Lin Yun because he hadn’t even held the Three-Lives Fruit for long. Last night, she saw how satisfied Lin Yun was with the Three-Lives Fruit. That was a rare time when Lin Yun was genuinely happy, and she could tell how important it was for him.

“That Mei Zihua is too despicable!” Luo Shuyi said.

Back at Dual Moon Lake, Lin Yun fell into the phenomenon. But in the eyes of others, he didn’t fit into the scenery as the world rejected him. His limbs were stiff, and his movements were clumsy.

When snowflakes fell onto him, each snowflake would slow his movement. If this continued, it was just a matter of time before he became immobilized.

“Ha, that fellow deserves it. He’s nothing but a clown before Mei Zihua.” Since some were feeling sad, there were naturally those who were happy. Hua Hongyu, who was standing beside Qin Hao, happily said when she saw this scene.

“A barbarian like him needs to be taught a lesson. Does he think that he can confront those from the Ten Musical Clans when he became the first on the Nirvana Banquet? Isn’t he a little too naive?” Qin Hao replied coldly.

They didn’t bother suppressing their voices, and their conversation was naturally heard by Luo Shuyi and the others, whose faces became ugly. What they said represented the thought of many people because Lin Yun was too arrogant during the Nirvana Banquet, suppressing everyone from the holy lands before becoming first on the Nirvana Banquet.

If they could choose, they would rather lose to Mei Zihua. At the very least, the latter was a descendant of the Mei Clan, one of the Ten Musical Clans. So it wouldn’t be embarrassing to lose to Mei Zihua, instead of to Lin Yun.

So when they saw Lin Yun suffering a setback, everyone naturally began to talk about it, especially with Qin Hao and Hua Hongyu taking the lead.

“It’s pretty hilarious. I thought he still had a trump card, but he actually took out the spike fiddle?” Qin Hao said in disdain, and his words immediately drew acknowledgment from the surroundings.

“Qin Hao, shut it!” Yan Tianchen roared coldly.

“Haha. Did I say anything wrong? Don’t tell me you really think that a barbarian can play the spike fiddle. If he has that capability, why won’t he play something for me…” Qin Hao smiled.

“Don’t push it!” Yan Tianchen barked.

“What’s the matter? Furious? This is your breadth of mind?” Qin Hao snickered. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Yan Tianchen’s face was ugly because he was already feeling anxious. So he nearly lost his composure when he heard what Qin Hao said. The pent-up emotions made him throw out a mouthful of blood, since he was still injured.

When Qin Hao saw this scene, his face changed, and he felt guilty. But Hua Hongyu didn’t let this go so easily and viciously said, “Don’t worry. Lin Yun’s injuries will only be more serious than yours!”

“It looks like the injuries on your face recovered too quickly.” Yue Weiwei said coldly.

Yue Weiwei’s words were no different from rubbing salt on Hua Hongyu’s wound because what happened was the greatest humiliation in her lifetime. With a vicious gaze, Hua Hongyu rebuked, “Don’t be too complacent. There will be a time when you cry! Now, that barbarian can’t admit defeat even if he wanted to, and he’ll be frozen to death!”
