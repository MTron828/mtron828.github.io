Chapter 1711 – Increase the Price (1)

When An Liuyan and Lin Yun returned to the serene pavilion, Lin Yun took a sip of the tea and asked, “What’s Liu Chenxin’s origin?”

“Young Master Lin is worried that he might take revenge against me? You don’t have to be concerned about that…” An Liuyan smiled. “I might be the Heavenly Star Pavilion’s manager on the surface, but my true identity is a venerable of the Demon Gate. Liu Chenxin is nothing compared to me.”

Lin Yun fell into a brief silence when he heard that because he nearly forgot about it. An Liuyan might seem friendly, but she was someone on the demonic path. To be able to become a Demon Gate’s venerable meant many people must’ve died before her eyes, and she couldn’t be underestimated. It was impossible for her to be in that position if she wasn't ruthless.

The competition within the righteous sects might be intense and brutal, but it was nothing compared to the demonic path. Some demonic cultivators even killed babies to cultivate, and none of them were soft hearted. Everyone couldn’t be just differentiated between righteous and demonic, but demonic cultivators didn’t have that many reservations when compared to someone on the righteous path.

“Liu Chenxin doesn’t have any impressive background, but his big brother isn’t simple. Not only in the Vermillion Bird District, but his big brother can be considered a figure in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea.” An Liuyan filled up the tea for Lin Yun and continued, “Young Master Lin, have you heard of the Four Young Masters?”

“Go on.” Lin Yun suddenly became interested.

“They’re the Wind Edge Lord, Snow Master Lord, Autumn Mountain Lord, and the Blue Frost Lord. Lord is a title given by the Divine Dragon Empire to young generations that aren’t part of the royal family’s lineage, and only those who are extremely talented can be bestowed with a title. Aside from the title not being able to be inherited, their positions are equivalent to Kings, and their clans will be conferred a title by the Divine Dragon Empire as well.” An Liuyan smiled. “You can take it as the Divine Dragon Empire making the four clans into their representatives since they can’t interfere in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. With that identity, they naturally have a noble status here.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The Divine Dragon Empire again! It appears that he couldn’t avoid the Divine Dragon Empire, no matter where he went in the Kunlun Realm.

“Wind Edge Lord is Liu Chenxin’s big brother, Liu Chenfeng. He’s also known as Wind Edge, and his strength is at the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. He was already in the top hundred on the Dragon Pulse Realm many years ago, and the Liu Clan is deeply rooted in the Heavenly Domain City. They have a close relationship with many forces and are in the limelight after being given a title.” An Liuyan explained. After filling up the tea for Lin Yun, she went behind him and massaged his shoulders.

Her hands were gentle, and she gave off a fragrance. Occasionally, Lin Yun could feel a soft squeeze on his back. As he heard what An Liuyan said, he could feel a hot breath on his neck, making him wear a bitter smile. An Liuyan really was a vixen.

“Oh, I discovered that the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion might be connected to the Azure Dragon’s lineage. Someone once saw an Azure Dragon on the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion, and their pavilion master also once displayed the dragon clan’s martial techniques. There are also rumors that they’re related to the Dragon Gate.” An Liuyan said.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he heard that because this meant that he was in the right place.

“How much do you know about the Four Musical Houses?”

“The Flying Snow Pavilion is proficient in weapons, the Seven Exquisite Palace is proficient in dance, and the Myriad Flower Hall is trained in both zither and the sword…”

“What about the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, then?”

“The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion ranks at last. They’re ranked at the bottom during the past few Nirvana Banquets. It has been a few centuries since the last Profound Fairy was born, but the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion is the most mysterious amongst the four. They’re not in a good situation recently, and there are rumors that they will be kicked out from being one of the Four Musical Houses.”

“Is the Profound Fairy important to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion?”

“It’s important because the Nine Heavenly Profound Dance inherited by the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion can only be practiced by the Profound Fairy. The moment the Profound Fairy succeeds, she’ll be able to suppress all the dancers who are in the same generation and even open the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s inheritance. But it’s difficult to practice, and I heard it has to be paired with the Ni Chang Dress Song…” An Liuyan explained.

“I see…” Lin Yun replied.

“Young Master Lin, take a look at this.” An Liuyan walked to a wall and opened a complicated spiritual array to retrieve an ancient book for Lin Yun.

“This is?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

An Liuyan’s face blushed, and she didn’t dare to look at Lin Yun. “Young Master Lin, just take a look…”

“Carefree Harmony.” Lin Yun was briefly stunned, looking at the title of the book. When he opened it, he finally knew why An Liuyan was blushing. This book was named “Carefree Harmony”, but had another name in the Heavenly Demon Canon—Harmonious Canon.

“This was created by a couple, becoming a demonic technique after it spread out. After all, regardless of whether harvesting Yin to nourish the Yang or vice-versa, there are consequences to them. It will leave behind a huge loophole in the heart. But if a couple practices it…” An Liuyan explained.

In the end, her voice became soft, and her face blushed red. She asked, “Young Master Lin, do you want to try it now?”

“Sure.”

A night later, Lin Yun left An Liuyan’s room and came to the guest room and saw Gu Jun. Four maids were massaging Gu Jun, but then the maids left when they saw Lin Yun.

“Mhm?” Gu Jun placed the saint fruit in his hand down and looked at Lin Yun with a weird smile, as though he had discovered a secret. He smiled, “It looks like you have a deep relationship with the Heavenly Star Pavilion’s manager.”

“Did you think you can stay here and enjoy your time if I didn’t have some relationship?” Lin Yun replied. “You’re really shameless.”

When he saw the list An Liuyan gave him, he finally knew how much Gu Jun benefited from the Heavenly Star Pavilion. Just the Profound Saint Pellets alone, Gu Jun had ‘borrowed’ over ten.

Aside from that, he would consume saint fruits as his meal, and he also got a lot of Profound Dragon Pellets that weren’t at all inferior to the Profound Saint Pellets. As for delicacies, he feasted on them like deserts.

Gu Jun’s expression became awkward, but he still denied it. He argued, “Don’t bullshit. I didn’t. I’m only borrowing them…”

“Did Saint Elder send anyone over?” Lin Yun asked.

“Of course. But I dealt with them for you, so you can be relieved.” Gu Jun smiled.

“Don’t forget that you’re only borrowing them and have to return them.” Lin Yun glanced at Gu Jun before leaving.

Hearing that he had to return them, Gu Jun immediately wore a smile and quickly followed behind Lin Yun. He tried to deal with it in his own way, but it was futile. Gu Jun even resorted that he would tell Saint Elder what happened in the Heavenly Star Pavilion, but Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t fall for that.

“Are the resources that little in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion?” Lin Yun asked. “You’re an expert at the pinnacle of the Samsara Edict Realm, and your position is only second to Jiang Yu.”

“Why do you think I have to ‘borrow’ them from the Heavenly Star Pavilion? The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion has been going downhill for the past few years. It’s still alright in the past because there were ways. But everything changed when Saint Elder came. The Pellet Chamber only listens to Saint Elder now, and there’s no way we can interfere with it.” Gu Jun sighed.

“As a Law Enforcing Elder, you’re really shameless.” Lin Yun said.

“You know nothing. Not everyone is blessed with great fortune, and not everyone has the protection of seniors. Profound Saint Pellets and Profound Dragon Pellets are extremely precious, and the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion didn’t have much even at their peak, not to mention the current Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.” Gu Jun smiled.

But just when Lin Yun was about to reply, the sounds of hooves galloping on the ground could be heard. When they turned their heads to where the galloping hooves came from, they could sense an outburst of ferocity sweeping over them.

They could see a group of people riding a black beast approaching their direction. They’re all donned in armor and gave off powerful auras.

Since flying was forbidden in the Heavenly Domain City, aside from Saints, there was a high threshold if anyone wanted to ride their mount or a carriage in the city. Before that party got close, everyone on the streets quickly split apart.

“It’s the Black Uniformed Guards!”

“It’s the Liu Clan’s Black Uniformed Guards. The Black Uniformed Guards rarely appear, so why did they appear so publicly now? Did someone offend the Liu Clan?”

“They seem to be the private army of the Wind Edge Lord!” Everyone in the surrounding area was shocked when they saw the Black Uniformed Guards.

“The Black Uniformed Guards?” Lin Yun furrowed his brows.

“The Black Uniformed Guards are the private army of the Wind Edge Lord. I heard they’re trained in the same method as the Divine Dragon Empire’s Scarlet Battalion. Each of them is specially picked out and were being groomed at Dragon Pulse Realm before officially joining the ranks of the Black Uniformed Guards.” Gu Jun explained. Gu Jun wanted to retreat to the side, but when Lin Yun wasn’t moving, he said, “Let’s avoid them.”

“They’re here for me.” Lin Yun replied.

The Black Uniformed Guards stopped a hundred meters away from Lin Yun and Gu Jun. This entire troop was donned in heavy armor and wore masks that only revealed their eyes. Right then, multiple gazes containing killing intent fell onto Lin Yun.

The leader of this party pushed his mask up and revealed his face. It was Liu Chenxin, whom they met not too long ago in the Heavenly Star Pavilion.

“Lin Xiao, you really know how to hide. I have been waiting for you for a long time!” Liu Chenxin coldly smiled. He had thoroughly investigated Lin Yun since he could call out his moniker, Lin Xiao.

“You still remember what I said previously? This matter won’t end so easily!” Liu Chenxin rode his black beast and looked at Lin Yun from a higher position, and his gaze was filled with disdain when he looked at Lin Yun.

He initially thought that Lin Yun had a vast background, but Lin Yun was just a lowlife from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

When Lin Yun swept his gaze over, the other party had sixty people, and the weakest was at the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. The two people beside Liu Chenxin had the highest cultivation and were both at the Samsara Edict Realm.

As for their stages at the Samsara Edict Realm, Lin Yun couldn’t tell because they didn’t make a move. Their black armor that they wore was saint amour that had a powerful spiritual array engraved on it and was reflecting a dark luster.

“Old man, the Black Uniformed Guards are here for business. So get lost if you don’t want to offend the Liu Saint Clan!” Liu Chenxin barked, since he couldn’t see through Gu Jun’s cultivation.

“Haha, I’ll get lost now.” Gu Jun bowed with a smile while he retreated to the side.

This made Liu Chenxin’s eyes flash with ridicule because he initially thought that Gu Jun was someone important. But it turned out that Gu Jun was a nobody after seeing how he bowed and wore a fawning smile.

“You don’t have to return, then.” Lin Yun said indifferently.

Gu Jun, who bowed and was about to leave, suddenly straightened his back. He looked at Lin Yun with a smile, “That’s a whole new story now, but they’re the men of the Wind Edge Lord, so there’s no way a pile of old bones like me can deal with them.”

Just when Lin Yun raised his head and glared at Gu Jun, the latter said, “So you have to increase the price!”

“I won’t bring you along next time, then.” Lin Yun replied without any expression.

“Old dog, didn’t you hear me when I asked you to get lost?” Liu Chenxin roared when he saw Gu Jun coming back.

“Haha, just for those two words, I can break an arm of yours.” The harmless Gu Jun suddenly turned around, and his expression was cold. When he coldly looked at Liu Chenxin, the horrifying aura that he gave off immediately made all the black beasts go down on their knees.

Chaos descended from the Black Uniformed Guards, and not even the mounts of the two Samsara Edict Realm’s experts were exempted. When their mounts fell onto their knees, their mounts began to twitch non-stop.

“Crawl!” As a terrifying chill swept out from Gu Jun, he flicked his finger before the Black Uniformed Guards could get on their feet.

As the Black Uniformed Guards’ armor began to shatter, waves of nirvana aura swept out and sent the Black Uniformed Guards flying away.

“Come here!” Gu Jun waved his hand and grabbed a hold of Liu Chenxin through the air.

“Not good!” The faces of the two experts beside Liu Chenxin changed, and they quickly grabbed onto Liu Chenxin’s shoulders, wanting to immediately leave with him.
