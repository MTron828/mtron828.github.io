Chapter 856 - Geniuses Gathered

Seven days later, the Ancient Southern Domain’s party arrived at Lonesky City. Throughout the journey, Yu Haotian had acted more reserved than before, which made everyone feel eerie. Lin Yun was rather surprised by Yu Haotian’s behavior.

After all, Lin Yun nearly killed him and forced him to kneel. Yu Haotian simply spoke eccentrically and kept his killing aura deeply hidden. Clearly, Yu Haotian’s patience was terrifying. When the party arrived at Lonesky City, they rested while waiting for the arrival of the other domains.

Lin Yun had nothing to do, so he enjoyed the charm of the city. The city was majestic and held elites from all the domains, including many Heavenly Soul Realm experts. Additionally, Lin Yun discovered that some of the Heavenly Soul Realm experts had already gone through their tribulation.

Their aura obviously stood out and gave Lin Yun a decent shock. He realized that the Heavenly Soul Realm was meaningless if one didn’t go through the tribulation.

A few days passed and the peace of Lonesky City was broken as the other domains were arriving. With the new batch of people, rumors spread like wildfire. Everyone spoke of their respective Dragoncloud Rankings with pride. However, one of the most interesting topics of conversation was that Lin Yun comprehended the spiritual sword intent.

To all the other domains, the Ancient Southern Domain was nothing. However, Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent had caused a huge commotion. Many people didn’t even dare to believe that someone grasped the spiritual sword intent when no one else in the Profound Realm had achieved this. It was even more incredible that such a monstrous genius came from the Ancient Southern Domain.

Whenever Lin Yun heard the wonder in everyone’s voice, he simply smiled. The entire Profound Amber Realm was nothing compared to the Heavenly Path. The fact that everyone chose to divide themselves by domains showed how limited their aspirations were.

Two days later, Qing Tu appeared and summoned everyone to head to the Profound Amber Mountain. The Profound Amber Mountain was the biggest mountain that Lin Yun had seen in his lifetime. Shockingly, two immense profound amber auras were enveloping the mountain.

The profound amber auras enveloped the mountain and also spread throughout the Profound Amber Realm in trace amounts. The quota selection would take place in the deepest part of the Profound Amber Mountain that was strictly guarded by the Sacred Alliance.

When the group arrived, Qing Tu led them to the Ancient Southern Domain’s seats.

Lin Yun was curious, so he looked around. He noticed a teleportation array at the center of the platform. It was engraved with spiritual runes and had eight array segments that shined bright.

“When the quota selection begins, you guys will be sent to a secret realm through the teleportation array. Those who fail or die will be removed from the secret realm. Also, the eight lights in the array represent the quota,” said Qing Tu. The rules were quite simple.

Lin Yun was shocked when he looked at the geniuses of the other domains. The aura they were emitting was terrifying, and every single one of them prevented their cultivation from entering the Heavenly Soul Realm. They were ambitiously accumulating their strength in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. Some of them were even glowing because of how powerful their accumulation was.

Compared to the other domains, the Ancient Southern Domain was lacking. However, there weren’t any who could enter Lin Yun’s eyes at the moment. Perhaps it was because they had hidden themselves well that weren’t discovered by Lin Yun.

“Big Brother Yun, look over there!” Yue Weiwei pointed in a direction as several people shot over. When Lin Yun looked over, he sensed many restrained auras. It was especially apparent with the grey-robed elder leading the party.

Although they looked like they were from the Sacred Alliance, they seemed a lot stronger than Qing Tu. When Lin Yun poured his spiritual sword intent into his eyes, he could vaguely sense four oceans of aura within their bodies. Each ocean was unbelievably massive as if it contained boundless energy that could release immense pressure.

The seven souls corresponded with the seven orifices. When a cultivator unlocked his seven orifices in Xiantian Realm, it prepared them to receive souls in the Heavenly Soul Realm. With every soul that was unlocked, an aura as boundless as the ocean would be added to their body.

The grey-robed elder seemed to have reached the fourth soul. Lin Yun simply couldn’t imagine how powerful the elder would be if he used four aura oceans at the same time. Lin Yun’s estimation was crude, so he couldn’t fully comprehend the elder’s strength.

“They’re from the Mountain Western Domain. The old man’s name is Chang Hai and he’s from the Sacred Alliance. You have to be careful of the person next to him, Zhong Xuan. He is this year’s champion of the Mountain Western Domain’s Dragoncloud Banquet.” Qing Tu transmitted his voice to Lin Yun upon noticing Lin Yun’s gaze.

Mountain Western Domain’s genius? Lin Yun fell into deep thought as he looked at Zhong Xuan. Zhong Xuan’s aura was a lot stronger than Yu Haotian and gave Lin Yun a bit of pressure.

This person’s foundation is actually stronger than mine! Lin Yun was shocked. Zhong Xuan had been in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm for at least two years, so he probably refined an unthinkable number of astral pearls. Additionally, it seemed like he cultivated a fortune martial technique longer than Lin Yun had.

Lin Yun put everything together. The Dragoncloud Treasury descended on the Ancient Southern Domain this time, but it had appeared pretty often in the four other domains. The other domains naturally had more in terms of fortune martial techniques. However, Zhong Xuan’s fortune martial technique probably wasn’t stronger than Lin Yun’s Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. Lin Yun was confident that he could fight Zhong Xuan even though he only cultivated his fortune martial technique for two months.

Sensing Lin Yun’s gaze, Zhong Xuan smiled. As the champion of the Mountain Western Domain, he was used to everyone looking at him.

“That person is Lin Yun, the champion of Ancient Southern Domain.” The grey-robed elder transmitted his voice to Zhong Xuan.

“Spiritual sword intent.” Upon hearing it, Zhong Xuan couldn’t help but examine Lin Yun. If Lin Yun really grasped the spiritual sword intent, then he couldn’t afford to be arrogant. It looks like Yu Haotian isn’t the only interesting person from the Ancient Southern Domain.

Zhong Xuan gave Lin Yun a smile before he looked away. He didn’t seem to be afraid of Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent. Lin Yun also retracted his gaze. With so many geniuses gathered here, he could sense the tense atmosphere.

It didn’t take long for Mound Northern Domain’s champion to arrive. This champion wasn’t any weaker than Zhong Xuan. With three domains gathered, Lin Yun noticed that even the runner-ups from the other domains were extraordinary.

If the Dragoncloud Treasury didn’t appear in the Ancient Southern Domain, there was no way Nangong Wanyu and the rest could compare to them. While Lin Yun looked around, the other domains examined the Ancient Souther Domain’s party with disdain. In their eyes, the Ancient Southern Domain didn’t amount to much.

“The Gauze Eastern Domain is also here!” exclaimed Qing Tu. Lin Yun’s eyes flashed when he heard that. He heard that the cultivators from the Gauze Eastern Domain were ruthless due to their harsh environment. Demonic sects were found everywhere and lives were treated no different from grass. Even the Profound Domain was fearful of those from Gauze Eastern Domain and would avoid offending them.

The Gauze Eastern Domain was led by a black-clothed middle-aged man who was also from the Sacred Alliance. However, he acted more arrogant and aloof than the other elders. Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with surprise because he never expected a demonic cultivator to be a part of the Sacred Alliance.

However, he calmed down when he remembered that the Sacred Alliance was a neutral force. It really wasn’t all that surprising to see a demonic cultivator. Next to the elder was a purple-clothed man with a cold gaze. He didn’t emit a powerful aura, but his appearance instantly attracted many people’s attention.

Lin Yun could clearly sense a boundless sword intent coming from him. However, the purple-clothed man didn’t look at Lin Yun. Instead, he appeared before Mu Han and asked, “Are you Lin Yun? You’re the monstrous genius from Ancient Southern Domain who grasped spiritual sword intent?”

Mu Han’s face became awkward when he heard that. Due to the improvement of his quasi-spiritual sword intent, he couldn’t control his sword intent well. As for Lin Yun, he didn’t emit any sword intent because his sword intent was at a high realm and he could control it as he wished. This meant that even the Sacred Alliance’s elders wouldn’t notice it if they didn’t look at him clearly.

“It’s been a long time, Brother Yan Mo.” Yu Haotian suddenly said.

“Yu Haotian, tell me who this Lin Yun is. I’m curious to see how strong the monstrous genius that grasped the spiritual sword intent is!” Yan Mo looked at Yu Haotian coldly.

Yu Haotian merely smiled before turning his gaze to Lin Yun.
