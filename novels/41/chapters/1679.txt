Chapter 1680 – Four Musical Houses

Lin Yun was a little furious that he was forced to disclose his identity. But looking at An Liuyan, he couldn’t get angry with her. When he raised his head, An Liuyan closed her eyes with trembling eyelashes, making her look even more charming.

In the end, Lin Yun knocked against An Liuyan’s head, and he used his strength in this knock. As a result, An Liuyan’s lip twitched as she opened her eyes and held onto her head. But the two briefly looked at each other before they both smiled.

“Get up. Don’t call yourself a maid anymore in the future. You’re a Nine-Star Demon Sovereign, the quasi-holy maiden of the Demon Gate.” Lin Yun helped her up and made her sit down before him. The Demon Gate was a supreme holy land, and the founder was the most mysterious Demon Emperor of the Nine Emperors.

Three millennia ago, the Demon Emperor defeated many demonic sect holy lands by himself and even dealt a heavy blow to the current Blood Moon Sect. He was a legend like Yu Qingfeng, with many myths revolving around him. Now, the Demon Gate was the ruler of all demonic sects, with their forces spread throughout the Divine Dragon Empire. Not even ancient holy lands dared to clash with them head-on.

If An Liuyan managed to become the holy maiden of the Demon Gate, she would receive a supreme position that no one could imagine.

“Thank you for your forgiveness. Can I know why you’re in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea?” An Liuyan smiled, looking at Lin Yun.

As Lin Yun changed his appearance to Lin Xiao, his temperament and gaze underwent a drastic transformation. Despite knowing that Lin Xiao was Lin Yun, this still made An Liuyan feel weird.

“Let’s put that aside for now. How did you recognize me?” Lin Yun asked. This was important because he would have to change many of his plans if there was a flaw in the Divine Tortoise Transformation. After all, the Divine Tortoise Transformation was known to be perfect and could even fool a Saint's eyes. But now that his identity was seen through by An Liuyan, Lin Yun wasn’t that confident anymore.

“I didn’t recognize you. I was disappointed when I removed your mask, and I only regained some confidence after seeing you making a move. Furthermore, you called out my surname when we met for the first time.” An Liuyan said. “Even so, I couldn’t be sure that you’re you. I only felt that if you go into hiding for a few centuries, there’s no difference between you being dead to me. If that’s the case, then I might as well die.”

Lin Yun was touched because he didn’t expect her to be so determined. But it looked like there wasn’t any flaw with the Divine Tortoise Transformation. After briefly pondering, Lin Yun shared with An Liuyan why he came to the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea.

“Heavenly Snow Lotus? I can handle that. It’s not easy to buy them on the Skyflowing Island, so you must go to Heavenly Domain City.” An Liuyan said, and she even shared with Lin Yun why Heavenly Snow Lotus couldn’t be purchased so easily.

Heavenly Domain City was on the Heavenly Domain Island, and it was at the heart of the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea, the center of the entire Eastern Desolation. The whole island was a city, and it was a majestic city of an unimaginable scale. It wasn’t an understatement to call it the biggest Saint City of the Eastern Desolation. Heavenly Domain City was known as a Saint City to many people.

“As for the Nirvana Pavilion…” An Liuyan furrowed her brows. “I haven’t heard of it before. Before coming here, I looked through much information and should know about every force in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea for the past three millennia.”

Lin Yun furrowed his brows when he heard that because that was weird. After all, Big Brother Jiang Ling clearly told him about the Nirvana Pavilion in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea.

“Why don’t I try and search for it after going to Heavenly Domain City?” An Liuyan asked.

After briefly pondering, Lin Yun shook his head, “You can, but it might not be useful. The Demon Gate’s information shouldn’t be wrong. Can it possibly be a hidden force that has gone into hiding?”

“That’s impossible.” An Liuyan replied. “Even if they’re hidden, their name should at least be known. But I’ve never heard of their name before.”

That was indeed the case. Everyone might not know where that force was located, but it was impossible for the name to be unheard of. Furthermore, it was the force of the Azure Dragon’s lineage. Even if it couldn’t be compared to the peak, it shouldn’t be nameless. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Are there any other mysterious forces that no one knows the origin of? They would also be related to the Azure Dragon’s lineage.” Lin Yun asked.

Azure Dragon’s lineage? An Liuyan briefly pondered before her pupils lit up, “Young Master, can it be the Heavenly Nirvana Palace?”

“Heavenly Nirvana Palace?” Lin Yun asked in doubt.

Nodding her head, An Liuyan replied, “That’s right. After the star exploded and fell into the sea, forming multiple islands, there was still one piece hovering in the air. It has a mysterious origin and would only appear once every century. There are many sayings about the Heavenly Nirvana Palace because it didn’t exist in ancient times, and yet no one knows its origin. I’m not sure if they’re related to the Azure Dragon’s lineage, but I can confirm that they have existed since ancient times. They might be an ancient force that changed their name.”

Lin Yun was surprised. If it was an ancient force that changed its name, the Heavenly Nirvana Palace might really be the Nirvana Pavilion.

“How can I go up there?” Lin Yun asked.

“There isn’t a way. No one knows where the Heavenly Nirvana Palace is located, not even the Demon Gate. There was a legend that the Three-Lives Tree is located in the Heavenly Nirvana Palace, and many people wanted to obtain it. But even Emperor Realm experts don’t know the location of the Heavenly Nirvana Palace.” An Liuyan smiled bitterly.

Even Emperor Realm experts didn’t know the exact location of the Heavenly Nirvana Palace. This made the Heavenly Nirvana Palace seem even more mysterious.

“But it will appear in half a year from now.” An Liuyan continued.

“Oh?”

Seeing Lin Yun’s doubt, An Liuyan explained, “The Heavenly Nirvana Palace will hold a Nirvana Banquet once a century, and the Nirvana Banquet is a banquet where musicians play for the Three-Lives Tree. The Three-Lives Tree loves music, and it will bloom sufficient Three-Lives Flowers if it is beautiful enough. As a result, the Nirvana Banquet gradually became a banquet for musicians in the Kunlun Realm. Every young musician wishes to show their talent at the banquet.”

“Does the Three-Lives Tree really exist in this world?” Lin Yun muttered to himself. He had heard rumors revolving around it, and it was said that the Three-Lives Tree could allow one to regain the memories of their past life.

“The Three-Lives Tree does exist, but it’s unknown if it can allow one to awaken the memories of a past life. But the Three-Lives Flowers are really mysterious. Some rumors say that consuming the tree leaves alone can allow one to enter the Three-Lives Realm, and the time flow inside is different from the outside world. Ten years in the Three-Lives Realm is only half an incense’s time in the outside world. This means the one who consumed the leaves will have an additional ten years to cultivate.” An Liuyan smiled.

Lin Yun was alarmed when he heard that. There were rumors that some ancient holy lands had secret realms that could alter time, and staying decades there would only reflect as a few days in the outside world. But there was a strict requirement to activate a secret realm, and each opening would exhaust an astronomical sum of resources.

But the Three-Lives Flower’s leaves could be consumed without any requirement. Just consuming one would allow one to enter the Three-Lives Realm to cultivate. This was a little too overbearing.

“How can I participate in the Nirvana Banquet?” Lin Yun asked.

“The Heavenly Domain City has four musical houses, the Flying Snow Pavilion, Seven Exquisite Palace, Myriad Flower Hall, and the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. They’re all formed by holy lands in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. The Heavenly Nirvana Palace doesn’t interfere with the outside world, so they gave the filtering task to the four musical houses.” An Liuyan smiled. “This is why I initially took you for a musician who came from the Divine Dragon Empire coming for the Nirvana Banquet.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered. The possibility of the Heavenly Nirvana Palace being the Nirvana Pavilion was really high. Even if it wasn’t, he still had to participate in the Nirvana Banquet because of the Three-Lives Flower.

“But it’s hard to make the Three-Lives Flowers bloom. Under most circumstances, the flowers won’t bloom. This means that one could only obtain the tree leaves, which are weaker than the flowers.” An Liuyan explained.

“Oh?” Lin Yun became intrigued by An Liuyan’s explanation.

“Yeah. The Three-Lives Tree is very picky and won’t bloom if the music isn’t beautiful enough. It is said that the last time the flower bloomed was a millennium ago. But participating in the Nirvana Banquet is an honor because the Heavenly Nirvana Palace is rumored to look like a celestial realm. When the banquet begins, the Heavenly Nirvana Palace will serve their guests wine brewed with saint fruits. If you’re lucky to catch the attention of the Heavenly Nirvana Palace, you can even be invited to stay there for some time. Aside from that, holy lands from all around will be invited to participate in the banquet. So the banquet is a grand event, especially for musicians.”

“This is why you’re in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea?” Lin Yun asked.

“No.” An Liuyan shook her head. “I’m here for the Black Tortoise’s inheritance. The Black Tortoise Ruin is in the depths of the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea, and all the Nine-Star Demon Venerables of the Demon Gate will be gathering here. This is a test, and those who have obtained the most harvests in the ruin will become the holy son or holy maiden of the Eastern Desolation’s Demon Domain.”

Lin Yun instantly understood what An Liuyan meant.

As An Liuyan winked her eye, she asked with expectations filling her tone, “Young Master Lin, do you want to travel to the Heavenly Domain City together?”

“No.” Lin Yun replied after a brief pondering. “We’ll go our separate ways and meet again in Heavenly Domain City.”

Lin Yun planned to look around Heavenly Domain City. He could only participate in the Nirvana Banquet if no Nirvana Pavilion existed. As for the Black Tortoise Ruin, Lin Yun would naturally accompany An Liuyan if time didn’t clash. After all, he would only benefit if An Liuyan became the Demon Gate’s holy maiden.

“We’ll meet in Heavenly Domain City, then.” An Liuyan didn’t have much disappointment in her pupils. “You can give these petals a try, and you can stay in the Heavenly Star Pavilion to refine them. I’ll be making my way there, first.”

“Okay.”

If An Liuyan hadn’t wanted to search for news about Lin Yun, she would’ve already left. Since she was able to see him, there was no longer a need to here to stay on Skyflowing Island. She would make her way to Heavenly Domain City first and help Lin Yun collect the Heavenly Snow Lotus and information on the Nirvana Pavilion. At that time, everything would be prepared for Lin Yun without him doing anything.

After the two briefly chatted, Lin Yun started to refine the Heavenly Snow Lotus that night to see if it was as miraculous as Lil’ Purple had said. After all, it was a problem if his dragon pulses remained damaged.
