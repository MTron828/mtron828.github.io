Chapter 1483 - Lin Yun, A Swordsman

Someone burst into the hall at a bad time. This person aggressively came in and didn’t bother hiding his killing intent. Then again, it was probably just as he said— Lin Yun took his position from him.

There were two chairs in the hall. The main chair was naturally for An Liuyan, but it was empty now. Lin Yun’s gaze wasn’t on him, but on the five other people in the hall.

An old man wearing black clothes and his closed eyes was in the seat next to the main chair. This person gave Lin Yun a feeling that he wasn’t simple. This should be the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm that An Liuyan spoke of. This was a ruthless person who trapped himself in the Elysium Core Realm for some myth instead of making a breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm.

As he glanced at the four remaining people, three looked to be middle-aged, and they were all at the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, emitting terrifying auras. The last person didn’t look much older than Lin Yun, and his cultivation was at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. This should be the spiritualist within the group that An Liuyan spoke of.

“An Liuyan, don’t you think I deserve an explanation?” The person who barged in could no longer suppress his rage after he saw Lin Yun’s cultivation level.

But An Liuyan waved her hand to have the guards stand down before saying, “Wang Qifeng, I don’t believe that I gave you any promise that I’d bring you along, right? Have I deprived you of cultivating resources for the past few days that you’ve been in the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion?”

Her words made the demonic cultivator by the name of Wang Qifeng, become ugly because he had nothing to say. What An Liuyan said was true. He was treated like an important guest when he stayed in the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion for the past few days.

After a brief hesitation, Wang Qifeng said, “You’re right, and I’m in the wrong. But I can’t accept that a piece of garbage at the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm took my position. This is the same as humiliating me!”

He was pretty eloquent with his words and didn’t push An Liuyan into a corner.

“What do you want, then?” An Liuyan frowned.

“That’s simple. Let this person exchange a move with me. I naturally have nothing to say if he can convince me with his strength.” Wang Qifeng said in a deep voice. Clearly, he was still reluctant about giving up the opportunity to the Dragon Clan’s astral realm.

“Sounds good.” The old man in black spoke up just when An Liuyan was about to refuse Wang Qifeng. When the old man looked at Lin Yun, his eyes flickered with dissatisfaction.

“Elder Chen!” An Liuyan was startled by what the old man said and called out to him.

“Milady, we can’t afford to be sloppy with the quotas. Wang Qifeng is a candidate that I recommended, and I can guarantee that he’s not weak.” The old man said indifferently. “Moreover, what he said is also very reasonable. The astral realm isn’t a game. If you owe him a favor, that’s the more of a reason why you can’t push him to his death.”

Anyone could tell this old man’s relationship with Wang Qifeng wasn’t simple.

“So be it.” Lin Yun interrupted just when An Liuyan was about to say something. It was, indeed, a little unreasonable for Lin Yun to interfere. He needed strength to back up his words if he wanted to be unreasonable.

“How do you want to spar?” Lin Yun said, calmly looking at Wang Qifeng. The atmosphere in the hall suddenly became interesting. Everyone had turned to look at Lin Yun. They never expected that someone at the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm would really dare to accept Wang Qifeng’s challenge. After all, Wang Qifeng was a genuine six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

“We’ll each use one move without using any saint artifacts. Whoever takes a step back loses.” Wang Qifeng said. He never expected Lin Yun to be so decisive to agree to the spar. Then again, he didn’t think there was any possibility he would lose; he was just worried that Lin Yun might have some exceptional means, such as arrays or secret treasures. So he suggested a form of spar that relied purely on their cultivation. He could sense that Lin Yun’s vitality was terrifying, but he didn’t think he would lose with the difference of two stages in their cultivations.

“Fine with me.” Lin Yun then glanced around the hall before continuing, “We can just get it done here. This room is barely wide enough.”

An Liuyan’s eyes helplessly flashed. After seeing Lin Yun being that stubborn, she could only return to her seat.

“Where did you find this person?” The old man transmitted his voice over to An Liuyan.

“His name is Lin Yun,” An Liuyan replied.

When the old man heard that, his face changed a little. He quickly asked, “Flower Burial Lin Yun?”

“Is there a second Lin Yun around?”

“That little guy is growing rapidly, reaching the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm in just six months. I remember he obtained the Profound Wither Great Saint’s inheritance, right? He had a good prospect ahead of him, but it’s a little uncertain now…” The old man’s impression of Lin Yun changed after knowing his identity.

But An Liuyan maintained her silence and didn’t say a word. She had some selfish thoughts in bringing Lin Yun over. She knew she was taking a risk, but her intuition told her the risk was worth it. This was a strong feeling that she had when she first met Lin Yun. It was unprecedented, or she wouldn’t have tried to befriend him or even give him a quota.

It was so much so that even if she failed the trial given to her by the Heavenly Astral Pavilion, she might be able to turn the tables around as long as Lin Yun owed her one. She was optimistic that Lin Yun could become a Saint in the future.

This was why she couldn’t maintain her composure when Lin Yun agreed to the spar. If Lin Yun lost, she wouldn’t be able to bring him along unless she gave Wang Qifeng enough benefits for him to give up, and she knew that the price would be high.

While her thoughts were drifting away, Lin Yun and Wang Qifeng were standing in a face-off. When they looked at each other, Wang Qifeng immediately felt an immense pressure accompanied by a sword aura that was being emanated from Lin Yun’s eyes.

This inwardly shocked Wang Qifeng because he had never felt such a powerful sword intent before amongst anyyone he met at the Elysium Core Realm. But fortunately, they would only exchange a move without using their saint artifacts, so it didn’t matter how strong Lin Yun’s sword intent was, it was useless. After all, they were competing purely in their cultivations.

“Sorry about this!” Wang Qifeng lit up all six stars in his violet palace without any hesitation, and his cultivation was instantly multiplied six-fold before slamming it at Lin Yun. When he was ready, Wang Qifeng pushed his palm forth, “Get lost!”

His palm instantly made Lin Yun feel a tremendous pressure as he compared Wang Qifeng with the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking. A cultivator would appear to undergo qualitative change after reaching the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

As soon as he pushed his palm forth, everyone in the room secretly shook their heads. The gap between them was too huge, and Wang Qifeng entirely suppressed Lin Yun’s aura. So they couldn’t see any possibility of Lin Yun winning.

Lin Yun knew that he could no longer underestimate Wang Qifeng. Without any hesitation, a cold flicker flashed through Lin Yun’s pupils as the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron flew out from the ocean in his violet palace, and his palm collided with Wang Qifeng.

Following a considerable impact, the outcome of the battle was instantly determined. As blood splashed, Wang Qifeng’s right hand began to shatter inch by inch, and his flesh was being invaded by a withering deathly aura. Lin Yun’s palm contained both the corrosive power of death and the destructive aura of the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron.

This exchange stunned many people, and even Lin Yun was shocked by this scene. After the Five Peaks Competition, Lin Yun hadn’t fought anyone. So when he faced Wang Qifeng, who was at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, he didn’t hold back and even used his biggest trump card.

But he had underestimated the power of his attack. Everyone else in the hall also bounced up from their seats as they looked at Lin Yun with shock; they couldn’t believe what was happening right before their eyes.

“You… who the hell are you?!” Wang Qifeng asked with his teeth gritted and his face distorted from the pain.

“Lin Yun of the Sword Sect.” Lin Yun calmly replied. He was also inwardly shocked and decided to keep this trump card hidden. Ever since the Nether Sword Seed was done nourishing the sword, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron became a lot easier to manipulate. The combined power of two sword sutras was terrifying, and he could’ve killed his opponent by accident.

“You!”

“Flower Burial!” Everyone exclaimed.

“Send him back.” An Liuyan came to her senses first and waved her hand to get someone to send Wang Qifeng back.

“I believe no one should have any objection to me being here now, right?” Lin Yun glanced around and went straight to the vacant seat before anyone could reply.

When everyone else sat down, they observed Lin Yun from time to time. After all, they had long heard of Lin Yun, who defeated Xiahou Yan. They didn’t doubt Lin Yun’s attainments in the sword, but they never expected that Lin Yun’s cultivation would reach such a terrifying height in just six months. They even suspected whether Lin Yun had used a secret technique.

“Haha. We found someone great this time!” The old man laughed, and he had no longer any objections.

As An Liuyan took charge of this matter, she glanced around, “This is the first time you guys have seen each other. So introduce yourselves before leaving.”

The hall fell into a brief silence before the middle-aged man sitting on the left of the black-clothed old man stood up and smiled, “Let me take the lead. I’m Can Jiu, and my cultivation is at the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. I’m proficient in using blades and assassinations. Moreover, I also have some accomplishments regarding the way of using poison.”

Lin Yun turned to look at this person, who had no scruples when he said he used poison.

“Haha. Brother Can Jiu is too humble. Your accomplishments in the way of poison aren’t just ‘some’.” Another person stood up. Nearly two meters tall, this burly man introduced himself, “My name is Ding Lei. Half of my bloodline comes from the Demon Clan. I’m at the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, and I’ve cultivated a Demon Clan’s body-refining technique.”

He briefly paused before he turned to look at Lin Yun and smiled, “Brother Lin, we can discuss it more when we have time. I can sense that your vitality isn’t any lower than mine, meaning you must’ve also practiced a body-refining technique.”

“Sounds good.” Lin Yun smiled, but he was inwardly surprised. It was rare for him to find someone whose physique was stronger than his while at the same cultivation level. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hehe. My name is Xiao Yun. My cultivation might not be impressive, but I’m proficient in miscellaneous things like arrays, spiritual diagrams, alchemy, and puppets.” The grey-clothed youth smiled.

Lin Yun discovered that these people were all talents. There was a poison master, a spiritualist, and a body-refining cultivator. No matter who it was, it wouldn’t be easy to deal with them, not to mention if they joined forces.

“Your turn?” An Liuyan smiled when Lin Yun was in deep thought.

Lin Yun came to his senses and raised his head, “Lin Yun, a swordsman.”

He fell into silence after a simple introduction, which briefly stunned everyone.
