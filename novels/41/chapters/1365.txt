Chapter 1366 - Grant You Death at the Summit of the Fleeting Clouds! (2)

After Lil’ Purple’s hands formed signs, she then tapped on her forehead and the shackles broke off from her forehead before coiling around Zhuge Qingyun several more times. When she was done, she hugged the Snow Heed Sword and flew to the sky before she weakly collapsed on the horse’s back.

“Quick, leave! The Divine Frost Chain can’t hold him back for long!” Lil’ Purple said while she gasped for breath.

Hearing what she said, Lil’ Red started galloping on the surface of the ocean as though it was running on flat land. When it galloped, a piercing noise resounded that tore space apart.

As for Feng Jue, he was being lifted on Lin Yun’s shoulder, while swaying from left to right as Lil’ Red galloped. But what made Feng Jue feel that the situation was even more unacceptable was the fact that he was actually being carried on Lin Yun’s shoulder. This was simply too humiliating!

“Junior Brother, let me down!” Feng Jue said. But as his cheeks trembled under the airflow, his words were unclear.

Hearing what Feng Jue said, Lil’ Purple muttered, “For someone like you who went down on your knees in just one attack, it’s best for you to keep quiet for now.”

What Lil’ Purple said nearly made Feng Jue throw out a mouthful of blood because her words were too harmful and vicious.

“How is that kneeling? That’s just my strategy of numbing my enemy!” Feng Jue argued, but Lil’ Purple merely responded with a snort and a roll of her eyes that made Feng Jue even more furious.

“You brat! I’ll give you a beating when I recover from my injuries!” Feng Jue raged because he was actually being looked down upon by a little girl. Most importantly, as he was being carried by Lin Yun on his shoulder, he couldn’t teach Lil’ Purple a lesson.

“If you dare to give her a beating, then I’ll throw you off right now.” Lin Yun’s threat resounded right at that moment, which instantly made Feng Jue shut his mouth. This made Feng Jue feel even more grievous because even his junior brother was bullying him.

“We’re here!” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when the outline of the Fleeting Cloud Island appeared before his eyes.

But right at that moment, Lil’ Purple threw out a mouthful of blood and said, “He’s coming!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You think you can escape? Let me see where you guys can escape to! No one in this world can save you guys!” Practically a split second later, Zhuge Qingyun’s voice resounded from behind.

Hearing that voice made Lin Yun’s face change because Zhuge Qingyun was too fast. But looking at the Fleeting Cloud Island that was just before him, a resolute light flashed through his pupils.

As the Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him, Lin Yun grabbed onto Lil’ Purple with his left hand while he carried Feng Jue in his right and soared into the sky. When he flew into the air, he pushed the Golden Crow Saint Rune to the limit, exhausting the majority of his astral energy in his violet palace practically in a split second.

“We did it!” It didn’t take long for them to arrive on Fleeting Cloud Island. When they landed on the Fleeting Cloud Island, joy could be seen on Lin Yun’s face. But when he raised his head, his smile disappeared when he saw Zhuge Qingyun, who was standing before them.

With just one glance, Lin Yun could feel an immense power crushing him and made him throw out a mouthful of blood as he fell to the ground.

“You guys have quite a lot of means!” Zhuge Qingyun coldly looked at Lin Yun, Lil’ Purple, and Feng Jue. He then continued, “But what’s the point of doing that? Since I said that you’ll be coming with me, then I will definitely bring you with me. You’re still not qualified to possess the Great Saint Origin!”

Lin Yun held onto his chest and didn’t say a single word. Zhuge Qingyun was simply too terrifying, and he even suspected that he wouldn’t have the chance to bring out the Firmament Battle Cloth to use against Zhuge Qingyun.

“Zhuge Qingyun, there’s no place for you to be arrogant!” Feng Jue rebuked as he looked at Zhuge Qingyun while he collapsed on the ground.

When Zhuge Qingyun looked at Feng Jue, he could only feel that Feng Jue was too laughable and snickered, The shame of the Radiant Sword Saint, what do you want to say?”

“You bastard! Don’t think that there’s really no one who can deal with you!” Feng Jue replied with his face turning red from rage. He then continued, “Since you dared to step on this island, then you’re destined to die!”

Zhuge Qingyun casually fanned the fan in his hand and mocked, “You think I don’t know why you’re trying to run to the Fleeting Cloud Island? Did you hope that that piece of garbage junior brother of yours will save you? Jian Jingtian, first on the three rankings? Since I have such a deep grudge against him, how will I not know that he’s being trapped in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect right now?”

“You!” This time, Feng Jue was left dumbfounded because he clearly didn’t expect that Zhuge Qingyun would know what he was planning right from the start.

“Even as the shame of the Radiant Sword Saint, you’re already at the Samsara Edict Realm. Yet, he’s still at the Dragon Pulse Realm. So you expect him to save you? First on the three rankings and invincible? Haha, that was in the past and not now!” Zhuge Qingyun gritted his teeth with his face distorted.

Evidently, he had a deep grudge against Jian Jingtian that was formed in the past. It was so much so that he might have even been humiliated by Jian Jingtian before.

“Do you believe that I can make you kneel in front of me before him, and he won’t even dare to utter a single word? He’s just a tortoise being trapped here. If he dares to utter a single word, then I’ll level the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect!” Zhuge Qingyun said coldly.

“Zhuge Qingyun, you’re not allowed to humiliate my junior brother!” Feng Jue roared while he gritted his teeth with his face turning red.

There was no way he could allow anyone to humiliate his junior brother, Jian Jingtian. After all, Jian Jingtian was his master’s favorite disciple who had once shone the brightest on the Divine Firmament Peak.

“So what if I humiliate him?” Zhuge Qingyun said coldly. “I’m saying that all for him to hear. You’re a piece of trash, and he’s a piece of trash who can’t even be compared to you. At the same time, your master, the Radiant Sword Saint, is also a piece of trash!”

But the moment he was done, Lin Yun could instantly feel that something wasn’t right.

At the same time, Zhuge Qingyun’s face drastically changed. When he turned around, his pupils squinted when he saw a sword ray expanding in his eyes.

The sword ray had filled his entire sight in a split second. But just when Zhuge Qingyun wanted to push a palm out to destroy the sword ray, something bizarre happened. Not only did he fail to destroy the sword ray, he was even sent flying back, instead.

Even when Zhuge Qingyun fell onto the surface of the ocean, the sword ray still didn’t let go of him that easily, making the heavens and earth look like they had been pushed back by the sword ray.

When the sword ray pierced through Zhuge Qingyun’s palm, he had slanted to the side to avoid taking this sword ray head-on; however, the sword ray still left a blood mark on his cheek. When a wind blew on his face, this made the blood mark even more terrifying.

“Jian Jingtian!” Zhuge Qingyun stood on the surface of the ocean as he raised his head to look at a figure standing at the summit of the highest mountain in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“Zhuge Qingyun, come! Come to the summit of the fleeting clouds, and I’ll grant you death!” A loud voice echoed between the heavens and earth. This made all the experts from the other powerful sects dumbfounded as they raised their heads to look at the summit of the snowy mountain on the fleeting clouds.

At the same time, nine majestic dragons appeared that spread to a hundred thousand miles, covering the light from the sun and moon.

This scene instantly left everyone dumbfounded, including the old monk from the Vajra Monastery. All of them had widened their mouths and couldn’t utter a single word. They began to wonder if Jian Jingtian was really in the Dragon Pulse Realm.

At the same time, what Jian Jingtian said echoed between the heavens and earth under boundless pressure.
