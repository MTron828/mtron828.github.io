Chapter 1690 – Heavenly Fragrance Medal

The Heavenly Origin Mirror was a Sovereign Saint Artifact of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. The fact that it was a Sovereign Saint Artifact was enough to show how strong the Heavenly Origin Mirror was.

When the Heavenly Origin Mirror appeared, everyone in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion could sense it, including Yue Weiwei, who was at the summit of the snowy mountain.

Yue Weiwei was dancing on the lake at the summit of the snowy mountain with red cloths fluttering around her. Those cloths might seem light, but they each contained a massive power. Gently tapping her foot on the lake, she rotated in mid-air and soared to the sky with the red cloths coiling around her, looking like rising waves.

The red clothes had formed into a crimson ocean, while she was a fairy dancing with the waves. Her smile was filled with boundless charm that made her look stunning. Suddenly, she stopped and raised her head before exclaiming in shock, “The Heavenly Origin Mirror?!”

Why did the Heavenly Origin Mirror appear? The Heavenly Origin Mirror was a Sovereign Saint Artifact of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. Something huge must have happened for a sect to summon their Sovereign Saint Artifact, and that direction seemed to be the Saint Altar.

Thus, Yue Weiwei began to wonder and was curious about what was happening. She had been staying in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion for the past two years and was dead bored. So the thought of taking a look instantly appeared in her mind. Rolling her eyes, Yue Weiwei looked at a hill not too far away and smiled sweetly, “Aunt, the Heavenly Origin Mirror has been summoned!”

“You’re not allowed to go anywhere.” A stern voice echoed from the hill. “The Nine Heavenly Profound Dance has a total of eighteen segments, each segment is further divided into nine sections, and each section is further divided into 108 movements. You’re not allowed to go anywhere if you can't dance well!”

“A-Aunt…” Yue Weiwei put on a sad face that would make anyone feel heartache for her.

“Dance. This has nothing to do with you.” The stern voice softened, but she still didn’t let Yue Weiwei leave.

“Hmph. How petty.” Yue Weiwei stuck out her tongue as she began to wonder what was happening in the Saint Altar.

The surroundings fell silent when the Heavenly Origin Mirror stopped about a thousand meters above everyone. Everyone was shocked because they never expected that this matter would develop in this manner. They came here because they wanted to know who Her Highness recommended, but the Heavenly Origin Mirror was even summoned for this matter.

Looking at the Heavenly Origin Mirror, Lin Yun felt a little anxious and awkwardly smiled, “Saint Elder, is there a need for you to take it this far? I’ve already admitted that I’m Flower Burial. You can come and touch to see if I have a divine dragon bone.”

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples inwardly cursed at how shameless Lin Yun was. But Mu Xueling looked at Lin Yun without any emotion on her face. She said, “Who do you think you are? Do you think you’re comparable to Flower Burial? That’s a monstrous genius who has even slain a Great Saint, an unprecedented monster in the past three thousand years!”

Lin Yun took a deep breath and could feel his teeth aching, but he couldn’t refute those words. Then again, he purposely used psychological warfare so that others wouldn’t link him with Flower Burial Lin Yun. But he had no idea what was wrong with Mu Xueling. It was fine that she said he wasn’t worthy of being him, but why did she bring out the Heavenly Origin Mirror?

“Since that’s the case, why bring out the Heavenly Origin Mirror now?” Lin Yun smiled.

“I already said that no one can touch you in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion if you’re really Lin Yun. If you’re not, my Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion doesn’t wish to be involved in trouble for no reason. So we have to make things clear today.” Mu Xueling said.

When the other elders heard what she said, they all nodded. There was no way Lin Xiao could be Lin Yun, but it would still bring them trouble if it got out. So it was best for them to make things clear with the Heavenly Origin Mirror.

But Lin Yun bitterly smiled because he knew he might be in trouble now.

“The Heavenly Origin Mirror has a long legacy, tracing back to ancient times. It’s also the supreme treasure of the sect that can see shine through all disguises. At full power, it can freeze everything and even turn back time. Nothing in this world can fool the Heavenly Origin Mirror!” Mu Xueling said as her hands joined together, and a terrifying aura swept out.

When her aura reached its peak, her hair began to flutter in the wind as the Heavenly Origin Mirror shone onto Lin Yun. When a beam of light shot out from the mirror, it enveloped Lin Yun and Mu Xueling roared, “Break!”

As the mirror began to change, lumps of black miasma appeared within the mirror. The black miasma looked mysterious, and everyone’s eyes were nervously glued to the mirror, including Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi. The latter’s despaired heart rose with a wisp of hope.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun was alarmed because the Divine Tortoise Transformation circulated when the mirror shone onto him.

As his dragon origin coursed through his veins, the path wasn’t something he was familiar with because there was no mantra on the tortoiseshell. Could it mean that the mantra was completed?

An ancient black tortoise appeared within his body when his dragon origin coursed through his veins. When the black tortoise appeared, his disguise, which was on the verge of falling apart, became firm. When the black miasma dissipated, the appearance reflected in the mirror was Lin Xiao.

“There are no changes.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s really Lin Xiao. Like I already said, how can he possibly be Flower Burial Lin Yun?”

“Do you think Flower Burial is stupid to appear in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion so openly?”

“Lin Yun’s master is the Radiant Sword Saint, and his disciple won’t be as despicable as him.” The outcome wasn’t surprising; only Luo Shuyi and Jiang Yu were disappointed. But they were disappointed for different reasons.

Mu Xueling’s facial expression was calm, but a brief surprise flashed across her pupils. She looked at Lin Yun deeply, “The Heavenly Origin Mirror can see through all disguises. Lin Xiao, if you dare claim to be Lin Yun again, I will personally chase you away, even if Her Highness, the Profound Fairy, recommends you.

“The Nirvana Banquet is near, and over eight thousand people have come to my Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. But including the disciples of my Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, less than a hundred made it through the nine tests. So I advise you to cherish the quota. Keep this Heavenly Fragrance Medal well.” A medal flew out from Mu Xueling.

When Lin Yun held onto it, he could sense countless envious gazes directed from the surroundings. After Lin Yun gave a weird look to the medal, he said, “Thank you, Saint Elder.”

“This has ended, so no one is to link him with Lin Yun anymore.” Mu Xueling removed the restriction on Jiang Yu, and she said with a warning tone, “You, too.”

Jiang Yu was stumped when he heard that. Did that mean that he took a beating for nothing? But he didn’t dare to disobey Mu Xueling and gritted his teeth, “Got it.”

“Lin Xiao, you better keep that temper of yours!” Mu Xueling looked at Lin Yun. After her gaze briefly stopped on him, she turned around and left.

This gave Lin Yun a feeling that Mu Xueling had seen something from the Heavenly Origin Mirror.

“Young Master Lin, you really scared me earlier.” Lin Wan held onto her chest.

After Luo Shuyi recollected her emotions, she persuaded, “Lin Xiao, you might have suffered some grievance earlier, but don’t be so disrespectful to Saint Elder anymore. If not for Her Highness, the Profound Fairy, Saint Elder definitely wouldn’t have let you go so easily.”

Lin Yun smiled and didn’t refute her words. He did that earlier because he was unhappy and he had no choice. He could hide his sword intent, but not the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. He did that to ensure that no one would link him with Lin Yun.

“I’m now curious about who this Profound Fairy is. Can I meet her?” Lin Yun asked.
