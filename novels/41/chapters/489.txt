Chapter 490 - Rules

After putting the Flower Burial Sword back into the sword box, Lin Yun carried it behind him. The weight of the box made Lin Yun feel slightly uncomfortable yet comfortable at the same time. He had been with the sword box for a long time and it had already become part of him. As a swordsman, having his sword back was when he was at his strongest.

When the other disciples saw that he was about to leave, they looked at him with a complicated gaze. It was impossible for them not to feel enraged that a fellow disciple died in front of their eyes. But this was still the academy’s scandal. After all, two disciples colluded to steal an outsider’s stuff. If news of this got out, who knows what kind of uproar it would cause in the Nether Prefecture.

So even if they wanted to act, they didn’t because they realized Lin Yun’s strength. As long as Liu Yunyan didn’t say a word, they could only watch as Lin Yun left.

Is Big Brother Lin going to leave? Bai Yi felt disappointed when she saw Lin Yun’s actions. She bit on her lips and wanted to say something but she didn’t know what to say.

Turning back to look at Bai Yi, Lin Yun gave her a smile before he turned to leave. He was still worried about Bai Yi’s safety and he wanted to stay if possible. But he killed one disciple and injured another one, so it was inappropriate for him to stay here any longer. He could only leave now that he had taken his stuff back. At most, he would just protect her from the dark.

“Wait.” Liu Yunyan called out before Lin Yun disappeared.

“What is it?” asked Lin Yun without turning back. There was no ripple on his face because he had regained his full strength. It was impossible for Liu Yunyan to force him to stay here.

“Are you the one who resolved the demonic beast's rampage like Bai Yi said?” asked Liu Yunyan.

“It’s nothing to me. Believe what you want.” He only helped out because of Bai Yi, not because of the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples.

“It might be nothing to you, but it’s significant to me. I can apologize to you for Lu Siyin’s matters if you’re really the one who resolved our troubles. This time, I, Liu Yunyan, will owe you one. The Heavenly Province Academy will also remember your favor,” said Liu Yunyan. She was always clear about the right and wrong. The reason why she kept the Flower Burial Sword was because Lin Yun had already become a cripple in her eyes. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have given the sword to Lu Siyin.

She couldn’t be blamed because Lin Yun hadn’t recovered from his injuries. As for the treasures that Lin Yun spoke of, all of them were extremely precious and were too unbelievable in her ears. But the truth was right in front of her eyes, so Liu Yunyan naturally had to be held responsible. Furthermore, if Lin Yun was the one who resolved their troubles, then she naturally had to repay him.

When Lin Yun turned around, he could tell that Liu Yunyan was serious about her words.

“Brother Lin, if you’re the one who resolved the crisis for us, the Heavenly Province Academy will definitely remember it,” said some of the other disciples. Previously when Bai Yi said it, they didn’t believe it because Lin Yun was a cripple. But Lin Yun had already proven his strength now, so they couldn’t help but think about the possibility.

So not all the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples are bad after all. Lin Yun pondered inwardly as he explained, “The mastermind is the one wearing a raccoon mask. You guys should be able to determine the mastermind if you guys recognize him.”

Lin Yun then took out a crimson raccoon mask and he threw it over.

“It’s him!” Liu Yunyan held onto the mask with her face changed. Upon seeing the mask, the other Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples also had fear in their eyes. Then, they look at Lin Yun with amazement.

“It looks like you guys do recognize this person,” said Lin Yun.

“Not only that,” said Liu Yunyan as she looked at Lin Yun, “This person is Nethercloud Ghost’s disciple, Leng Yi. Two years ago, the Nethercloud Ghost joined the Bloodwing Pavilion as a guest elder and his disciple also joined the Bloodwing Pavilion. Many of our disciples died in his hands. He’s proficient in a sinister cultivation technique.”

She then looked at Lin Yun with doubt in her eyes, “I do have a question, but I’m unsure if it’s appropriate for me to ask.”

“Go ahead.”

“Even I will have a hard time with Leng Yi. How did you manage to defeat him?” asked Liu Yunyan.

“I didn’t defeat him. He suffered from the backlash of the array back then and he was significantly weakened,” said Lin Yun. If his opponent didn’t suffer the backlash back then, he wouldn’t have had an easy time facing that masked man without his sword. But now that he had his sword, he was confident in defeating the masked man if they met again after he refined the Heavenly Soul Realm’s beast core. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

From Lin Yun’s explanation, everyone found it to be reasonable. Then again, it still felt unbelievable that a quasi-Violet Palace Realm swordsman was able to destroy Leng Yi’s array.

“Senior Sister, didn’t I say it earlier? Big Brother Lin must be the one who resolved the Draconian Rockrats crisis. After all, he promised me,” said Bai Yi with a prideful expression.

“I misunderstood you,” said Liu Yunyan in an apologetic tone. She also didn’t believe Bai Yi’s words back then.

“It’s fine. Hehe, I knew that Big Brother Lin would come back and prove it for me,” smiled Bai Yi. Bai Yi’s innocence made Liu Yunyan smile.

“If possible, I hope that you guys can give up on the Indigoflame Goldlotus. It’s dangerous, and I don’t wish to see Bai Yi courting death with you guys,” said Lin Yun. Since they had proven that Leng Yi belongs to the Bloodwing Pavilion, this meant that the journey would be dangerous. The Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples’ faces turned ugly when they heard his words. What Lin Yun said was true. The Bloodwing Pavilion was already hard to deal with, not to mention Leng Yi.

“Big Brother Lin, why don’t you help us again? The Indigoflame Goldlotus is very important to senior sister,” begged Bai Yi. After all, how could the core disciple of the academy not be important? Lin Yun had also been in a sect, so he knew how important a core disciple was.

The amount of resources were significantly different, but Bai Yi was too insensitive to try this again. Lin Yun merely smiled, but he didn’t say anything else.

Liu Yunyan smiled bitterly when she heard that. Bai Yi was really naive. Lin Yun clearly didn’t like them and he only helped them previously because of her. So how could he possibly help again?

“Young Master Lin, why don’t we approach this with some common rules instead?” Liu Yunyan looked at Lin Yun.

“I’m not lacking in spiritual jades,” said Lin Yun. He got a thousand third grade spiritual jades from defeating Leng Yi, which he had pocketed.

“You don’t lack spiritual jades, but what about the Indigoflame Goldlotus? I believe that it won’t be easy for you to get them by yourself,” suggested Liu Yunyan. She was sure that Lin Yun was also interested in them. Then again, she had clearly underestimated Lin Yun.

“I can find anyone to cooperate with my strength, but I don’t believe that anyone will refuse me. Let’s take the Bloodwing Pavilion for example. I believe it’ll be easy for me to work with them, so why should I pick you guys instead?” Lin Yun looked at Liu Yunyan with a playful smile. Liu Yunyan must’ve underestimated him to think that she could get him on her boat without paying a price.

“I can recommend you as the Heavenly Province Academy’s guest deacon if I become a core disciple. A guest deacon can also browse through jade slips and ancient books. If you’re willing to work for the academy, you can even increase your position,” said Liu Yunyan.

A guest deacon’s position wasn’t small and Lin Yun was surprised by Liu Yunyan’s decisiveness. No wonder she had such prestige among the group. Lin Yun swept a glance out at the camp before he said, “But your academy has already suffered a significant loss with today’s attack. Even if I was to help, the odds of winning the Bloodwing Pavilion aren't high. Furthermore…”

Furthermore, their competitors weren’t just the Bloodwing Pavilion.

“You don’t have to worry about that. Aren’t you curious why the Bloodwing Pavilion resorted to such a low move despite having an advantage in numbers? This means that they’re afraid of our academy. Furthermore, you’ve never seen the true means of our academy,” said Liu Yunyan calmly with pride in her eyes.

Spiritual runes! Lin Yun instantly thought of something. He noticed that the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples were proficient with spiritual runes. When he looked at Liu Yunyan again, he noticed that she was giving off an unfathomable air. He only recalled now that Liu Yunyan was also a second grade spiritualist.

“Alright, I’ll agree to it.” Lin Yun agreed without any hesitation.

“But a disclaimer, you’ll be responsible for dealing with Leng Yi. If you’re not able to deal with him, then I also can’t fulfil my promise. Naturally, you don’t have to defeat him, you just have to hold him up,” said Liu Yunyan.

This made Lin Yun interested because Liu Yunyan wasn’t simple. Raising his brow, Lin Yun smiled, “As you wish. I will do my best. But how do you intend to deal with that woman?”

Lin Yun glanced at Lu Siyin in the corner.
