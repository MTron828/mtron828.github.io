Chapter 2420 - Preparation

In the Fallen God Valley, Su Ziyao unleashed the full power of the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. The Golden-Purple Dragon Crown was subdued by Su Ziyao, fusing into her Imperial Dragon Fist.

A brief moment later, the bone hand finally couldn’t hold on any longer and let out a scream, “I surrender! I submit!”

“Too late,” Su Ziyao said as she pushed her palm forth with thousands of dragons appearing. In the next moment, bells began to ring as Su Ziyao’s past began to appear. This was the phenomenon of a legend with her past fusing with the Kunlun Realm’s heavenly dao. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Lin Yun had a similar phenomenon in the past, so it was only natural that Su Ziyao received the acknowledgment of the Kunlun Realm’s heavenly dao with her talent and strength.

When Su Ziyao clenched her fist, the dragons were grabbed by her before forming a terrifying punch, smashing apart the black mist. When the surrounding space stabilized, Su Ziyao hovered in the air, releasing a dazzling golden radiance from her body. Her gaze fell onto the bone hand that had revealed its actual appearance now.

After the consciousness was wiped out, the bone hand blazed with golden flames, giving off a powerful aura. When the index finger moved, a powerful golden aura swept out that consumed all the light in the surroundings. Compared to when it was conscious, the bone hand had become much stronger now, even causing the Divine Mulberry Tree and the surrounding space to tremble.

But Su Ziyao had no fear when she looked at it, and the aura was stopped by the crown she was wearing. She said, “This is the true appearance of the bone hand. You have died protecting the Kunlun Realm, and I admire someone like you. If I can obtain your inheritance, I will also inherit your will!”

When she said that, the aura disappeared and the five fingers spread out.

Su Ziyao nodded and reached out. The bone hand then merged with her palm. Roughly about fifteen minutes later, the bone hand had completely fused with her right hand, and the entire Fallen God Valley began to tremble when she clenched her fist. She couldn’t completely control this power and had to take a few steps back.

When she raised her head, the Fallen God Valley could no longer trap her, and she could leave anytime. Her gaze fell onto her right hand, and she soon decided that now wasn’t the best time to leave. If she left this place, she would quickly catch the attention of the Divine Dragon Empire, and it would be troublesome for her. Right now, she still needed time to get used to this hand and cultivate the inheritance within it.

“There’s still no news from Lil’ Purple, which means that the Radiant Sword Saint hasn’t started his tribulation yet...” Su Ziyao muttered. According to their discussion, Lil’ Purple would leave and send her news when the time came. At that time, she would forcibly leave the Fallen God Valley, regardless of whether she managed to refine the bone hand. After making up her mind, she muttered again, “I wonder how he is now...?”

They parted not long after they conducted their marriage, and earlier she wanted to go out to look for Lin Yun when she raised her head. But when she looked at her right hand, she calmed herself down with a determined look that she would stand by Lin Yun’s side this time, even if she had to become the enemy of the Divine Dragon Empire!

At the same time, on the other side of the God Burial Mountain Range, it was time for Wang Muyan to make a decision. The restriction on the God Burial Mountain Range was still around, but it was no longer that dangerous for Saint Lords to come and go.

Wang Muyan and Zhao Tianyu were in a damaged palace, and there were many experts from the Blood Moon Sect guarding the surroundings. Zhao Tianyu looked at Wang Muyan, and said with a grave expression, “Muyan, the preparations for the ceremony are almost done, so it's time to make a decision.”

He knew what the ceremony meant. This had been a secret plan of the Blood Moon Sect, which was to completely undo the seal within Wang Muyan’s body.

Wang Muyan frowned, “Do we really have to join hands with the Demonspirit Clan?”

“After losing the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, it’s impossible to shake the Demonspirit Clan away. I know what you’re worried about. The Demonspirit Clan has been scheming with this Heavenly Void for many years, and they will be able to leave if the ceremony succeeds. At that time, it will be a disaster for the Kunlun Realm,” Zhao Tianyu said. “But we don’t have a choice. The seal left behind by the Southern Emperor is too strong, and there’s nothing we can do about it even after three thousand years.”

The Blood Moon Sect had been plotting for a long time within the God Burial Mountain Range to break the seal left behind by the Southern Emperor that seals the Blood Monarch’s remains. Everyone in the Kunlun Realm knew about the Nine Emperors, but they didn't know about the Three Monarchs. The Blood Monarch was someone who had reached the Deity Realm.

With the Heavenly Path severed, the Blood Monarch used another trick to become a deity in the Kunlun Realm, and he should’ve ruled the Kunlun Realm. But alas, he ran into the Southern Emperor, who used a forbidden technique to make the Blood Monarch unable to unleash the true power of a deity and defeated the Blood Monarch before the latter could consolidate his cultivation.

But even if the Blood Monarch lost, a deity couldn’t be truly killed, so the Southern Emperor could only seal his remains by using the God Burial Mountain Range’s energy. The Blood Moon Sect had been trying to break the seal throughout the years so that the Blood Monarch could descend on the Kunlun Realm once more.

Now that the Southern Emperor was dead, no one could stop the Blood Moon Sect if the Blood Monarch returned.

Wang Muyan said in a worried tone, “But there are members from the Demonspirit Clan in the depths of the God Burial Mountain Range, and they’re more terrifying than you can imagine. The Demonspirit Clan’s deities are also sealed here. If we break the seal, it’s hard to ensure that none of the Demonspirit Clan’s deity will awaken.”

“We don’t have to worry about that. The Demonspirit Clan’s deities won’t awaken unless the Heavenly Path is reforged. If the Blood Monarch can return, I believe that he can help suppress the Demonspirit Clan that's hiding in the Heavenly Void so that the Demonspirit Clan’s deities won’t awaken,” Zhao Tianyu said.

Despite Zhao Tianyu saying that, Wang Muyan knew that the Ying River King wasn’t a fool, and he must’ve considered that possibility since he was willing to cooperate with the Blood Moon Sect. But Wang Muyan had no choice now, so she asked, “When will the ceremony be held?”

“During the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation. Everyone’s gazes will be focused on the Sword Sect at that time, so it will be easier for us,” Zhao Tianyu said.

The Eastern Desolation’s Black Mountain was a sacred ground for demonic cultivators. There might not be any Emperors here, but there were Black Mountain’s famous Seven Saints. The seven of them were all Great Saints, and each was infamous.

As long as no Emperors appeared, the seven could kill anyone. There were even rumors that the seven could confront an Emperor together.

The Black Mountain wasn’t a sect, and the seven saints didn’t even manage the mountain. As a result, the competition here was intense. But the seven saints were gathered together, drinking wine with a person. This person was sitting on the last seat, but the seven saints were respectful to him.

This person had golden hair and a feminine beauty. He had pearly skin, and was a flawless man, no matter how you looked at him. He was like a perfect picture, and this person was naturally Tian Xuanzi.

“I will strive for supremacy in the Ancient Barren Domain this time. I might've discussed it with the Ming Cult, Heavenly Flame Sect, and Myriad Lightning Sect, but my true reliance is the seven of you!” Tian Xuanzi smiled. Others only knew that Tian Xuanzi was trying to strive for supremacy in the Ancient Barren Domain, but no one knew that when he was younger, he became sworn brothers with the Black Mountain’s Seven Saints.

“Hehe, the Radiant Sword Saint’s name had spread throughout the Eastern Desolation back then, and we’ve suffered in his hands. If Brother Netherport hadn’t lost to him and had his dao heart damaged, he would’ve become an Emperor by now.” The White Bone Great Saint amongst the seven saints smiled, looking at a swordsman.

Netherport Sword Saint was one of the three Sword Saints in the Eastern Desolation. Everyone placed him on the same level as the Radiant Sword Saint, but no one knew that he had lost to the Radiant Sword Saint a long time ago.

The Netherport Sword Saint indifferently said, “There’s a grudge between me and the Radiant Sword Saint. If he becomes an Emperor, the entire Black Mountain might be levelled. So even without you, I won’t let him face his tribulation so easily. Since he severed my path to become an Emperor, I won’t let him become one! If he’s not dead, the demon in my heart cannot be resolved!”

The Netherport Sword Saint slammed his cup on the ground with murderous intent on his face. The seven saints and Tian Xuanzi soon came to an agreement. If Tian Xuanzi didn’t stand out, the seven saints would have to bear some pressure while facing the Sword Sect. But since Tian Xuanzi was willing to stand at the front, it was the best for them.

Tian Xuanzi smiled sincr these seven demonic cultivators were easier to manipulate than the three holy lands.

“I heard Divine Phoenix Mountain wants to help the Radiant Sword Saint. The Heavenly Dao Sect probably won’t stand by and watch, either. Can the three holy lands be counted on?” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint said.

Tian Xuanzi smiled, “It’s not that easy to break free from me. How can you only accept benefits and no risk? As for Divine Phoenix Mountain and Heavenly Dao Sect, I won’t mind destroying them if they dare to make a move. There are too many holy lands in the Eastern Desolation. I have ways to deal with them and unite the Eastern Desolation! No one can stop me! A declined Heavenly Dao Sect and the Divine Phoenix Mountain that only knows how to hole up? They’re nothing in my eyes!”

The eyes of the seven saints flashed when they heard that. Tian Xuanzi carried that Empress’ will to make a move, which meant that the Radiant Sword Saint would die no matter what!
