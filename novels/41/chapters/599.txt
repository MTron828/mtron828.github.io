Chapter 600 - Phenomenon in the Starry Sky

“Sorry about your sword,” said Lin Yun as he looked at Mu Chen’s sword that was only left with the hilt. Although he couldn’t understand the reason behind the destroyed sword, he knew that it was related to the mysterious sword within his body.

“Ah” Mu Chen was woken up from his stupor as he replied awkwardly, “Don’t worry about it…”

A long time later, Mu Chen spoke with great difficulty, “T-thank you for your help.”

He was naturally embarrassed by the words he used when he had been looking down on Lin Yun. But when he noticed that there weren’t any changes to Lin Yun’s face, he finally felt relieved. In the end, he could only smile bitterly. He was still thinking about working together with Lin Yun to survive the ordeal, but Lin Yun had merely used an attack to kill the three disciples from the Bloodwar Pavilion.

But he still couldn’t accept the fact that the difference in strength between him and Lin Yun was so great. Was he so weak that he couldn’t even take an attack from Lin Yun? When Mu Chen thought of how he provoked Lin Yun previously, he couldn’t help feeling ashamed. So it turns out that Lin Yun had the strength to kill him with a slap all along, but Lin Yun just didn’t want to bother with him.

“Lin Yun, were you always so powerful?” Mu Chen asked Lin Yun since his heart was so unwilling to yield. If Lin Yun didn’t have this strength within the Withernorth Sea, there was without a doubt that he would feel better.

Lin Yun raised his head and said, “I had a few encounters in the Withernorth Sea. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t be able to make my breakthrough into the Yang stage. But before my breakthrough, killing the three of them would only require three attacks from me.”

“That’s impossible,” said Mu Chen. Most importantly, Lin Yun’s strength was only in the pinnacle Yin stage at that time.

“You don’t believe me?” Lin Yun released a little of his sword intent. When the chilling sword intent was released from Lin Yun, it felt like he was in the center of the world.

“Xiantian sword intent in greater mastery!” Mu Chen exclaimed to which Lin Yun merely responded by nodding his head.

“So it’s true…” Mu Chen was speechless as he smiled bitterly. He had some guesses about Lin Yun’s sword intent earlier, but he was utterly shocked when the answer was revealed to him. After all, he didn’t expect Lin Yun’s sword intent to reach greater mastery.

As a swordsman, Mu Chen naturally knew what it meant. Even in the Heavenly Sword Sect, there weren’t more than three who grasped the xiantian sword intent in greater mastery.

The Heavenly Sword Sect only had three disciples who grasped the xiantian sword intent in greater mastery. So when Mu Chen looked at Lin Yun again, he noticed that Lin Yun’s temperament had undergone a small transformation. Lin Yun wasn’t any inferior to the geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking now.

Organizing his thoughts, Mu Chen voiced his concern, “I’m sorry about earlier. But you just killed Ji Wuye’s junior brother and the Bloodwar Pavilion’s disciples have always been fearless. They’ve never placed the overlord forces’ disciples in their eyes. If Ji Wuye pursues this matter, I’m afraid that…”

“They’re already dead. I can’t just stand here and do nothing. Furthermore, it won’t be easy for Ji Wuye to find out the culprit,” said Lin Yun.

“Yeah, that makes sense. Let’s leave this place quickly and join up with the rest.” Mu Chen was still concerned and he didn’t dare to stay here for too long.

Right at this moment, a black beam shot into the sky that connected heaven and earth, producing a starry sky. At the same time, everyone could roughly see the outline of a tomb that emitted an ancient aura..

“The empyrean’s tomb!” Mu Chen exclaimed.

When Lin Yun raised his head, the commotion caused by the phenomenon was great. It looks like the seal on the empyrean’s tomb had weakened and it could no longer suppress the phenomenon. In the starry sky, there was an enormous star that outshined others.

“That’s the Astral Pearl!” Mu Chen said in a grave voice just when Lin Yun was feeling baffled.

“Astral Pearl?” Lin Yun looked at Mu Chen with questions. Mu Chen was stunned before he recalled that Lin Yun had always been in the Heavenly Province Academy and there was a possibility that he didn’t know about it. After all, everyone Lin Yun knew what was told to him by Mo Ling and Mo Ling only told him about the Profound Yin Water.

Mu Chen hesitated briefly and explained, “This isn’t a secret. You must have come in contact with some geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking these days. Didn’t you notice that all of them were stuck in the pinnacle Yang stage?”

Lin Yun pondered this and realized that this was really the case. Regardless of Ji Wuye, Yan Kong, Yang Fan, and Guo Xu, they were all in the pinnacle Yang stage. They were in the pinnacle Yin stage and lesser Yang stage four years ago. So based on their talents, they should’ve made their breakthrough to the Yin-Yang stage long ago.

It wasn’t easy making a breakthrough into the Yin-Yang stage and many people were stuck in it for a long time. But it shouldn’t be a problem for geniuses. So under Mu Chen’s explanation, Lin Yun gained a rough understanding of the situation.

So it turns out that they could make their breakthrough any time they wanted, but they just didn’t want to do it. After all, martial souls were important in the Yin-Yang stage. Anyone with ambition would try to upgrade their martial souls to the profound eighth grade before making a breakthrough. Those in the top seven on the ranking even went as far as upgrading their martial soul to earth grade before making their breakthrough.

“You’re saying that the Astral Pearl can upgrade the martial soul?” Lin Yun asked with his eyes glowing.

Mu Chen nodded his head and pointed at the brightest star in the sky, “Spiritual energy comes from the sun and moon’s essence. But after reaching the Empyrean Realm, a cultivator can absorb the sun and moon’s essence directly from the stars. When an empyrean dies, the astral energy within their body will condense into a pearl, which is commonly known as the Astral Pearl. Look, it’s that one. But the other pearls also have a decent effect.”

“I see…” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and said, “So the most precious thing in the empyrean’s tomb isn’t the empyrean’s legacy or Profound Yin Water, but the Astral Pearl!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He roughly knew why Mo Ling didn’t tell him about it. After all, Ji Wuye and those on top ten on the outer ranking would go after the Astral Pearl and Mo Ling must have been concerned that he would start a conflict with them. When Lin Yun raised his head to look at the starry sky, he fell into deep thoughts.

Clearly, the phenomenon in the starry sky came from the empyrean’s corpse. The genuine Astral Pearl must be in the tomb. But the phenomenon was just too shocking. Was this the strength of an empyrean expert?

He couldn’t believe that a deceased empyrean still had such great prowess even after his death. He couldn’t imagine how powerful this empyrean was when he was still alive. This kind of expert must be someone that everyone admires.

It was at this moment that Lin Yun determined that he would also possess such strength in the future. As if the Flower Burial Sword had sensed his thoughts, it began to buzz within the box. It had been a long time since it came out and it was growing impatient. But Lin Yun wasn’t in a rush to use it. The moment it was upgraded to a cosmic artifact was the day it would reappear.

Retracting his gaze, Lin Yun smiled, “Let’s go.”

Wearing a smile on his face, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed. This phenomenon must have attracted all the geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking, right?
