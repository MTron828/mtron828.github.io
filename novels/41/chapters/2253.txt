Chapter 2254 - Wedding Ceremony

“Let’s get married!” Su Ziyao said without a hint of hesitation.

Lin Yun was stunned as he lifted the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown with both hands, dumbfounded by what Su Ziyao said. He even suspected that he had heard wrongly. He never dared to dream of this after arriving in the Kunlun Realm, so he couldn’t conceal his joy when he heard her.

“Let’s get married,” Su Ziyao repeated, but her tone was even firmer this time.

After confirming that he didn’t hear her wrongly, Lin Yun said, “Ziyao…”

“Don’t talk. You just have to tell me if you’re willing.” Su Ziyao interrupted Lin Yun, looking at him with a firm gaze containing a hint of chill.

“I’m willing,” Lin Yun replied.

A smile appeared on Su Ziyao’s face as she helped Lin Yun up, taking possession of the crown from him. She said, “I’ll consider this as the betrothal gift, and I like it.”

Right then, a figure descended from the sky. When Lin Yun and Su Ziyao turned around, they saw Lil’ Purple, who had been eavesdropping on them. After she fell to the ground, she looked at Lin Yun with grievance and tears welled in her eyes. She ferociously looked at Su Ziyao before turning to Lin Yun. After looking at Lin Yun, she finally couldn’t contain herself anymore, and cried out, “I’m not willing! You scumbag, you promised that we would always stay together. You’re too much!”

The more she cried, the more heartbroken Lil’ Purple felt, feeling as though she was abandoned. They had already promised each other that they would be together forever, along with Lil’ Red. Her cries were heartbreaking, causing Lin Yun’s heart to clench.

He quickly stepped forth, wanting to comfort her.

“Let me do it, instead.” Su Ziyao stopped Lin Yun before she walked over to Lil’ Purple under Lin Yun’s doubtful gaze.

He was a little nervous because he knew that Su Ziyao wasn’t someone who would spoil others. The first time she saw Lil’ Purple, she nearly killed her. If he hadn’t stopped Su Ziyao, she might’ve made a move on the spot.

Lin Yun stepped forth, grabbed Su Ziyao’s wrist, and said, “Don’t hurt her, no matter what she has done in the past. In this lifetime, she’s someone I want to protect.”

What he said wasn’t wrong because he had experienced life and death with Lil’ Purple multiple times. Their relationship had far surpassed family affection and love. He didn’t talk much about it, but they had no barriers and were willing to do anything for each other.

“She’s right, you’re a scumbag.” Su Ziyao looked at Lin Yun deeply. However, she wasn’t angry, but smiled, “I won’t hurt her. Those you care about are also those who I care about. So believe me.”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Lin Yun finally let go of Su Ziyao, watching as she walked over to Lil’ Purple and whispered in the latter’s ears. It didn’t take long before Lil’ Purple’s cries became softer as she doubtfully looked at Su Ziyao.

This instantly made Lin Yun curious about what Su Ziyao told Lil’ Purple. But he ultimately held it in and didn’t use his sword intent to eavesdrop.

“Really?” Lil’ Purple no longer cried and asked, looking at Su Ziyao.

“Really.” Su Ziyao nodded as she helped Lil’ Purple back onto the ground. She smiled, “I bet it’s hard to find a crybaby phoenix like you, even in ancient times.”

Lil’ Purple blushed and furiously said, “When did I cry? I-I-It’s just that the wind was too big, and sand got into my eyes!”

Su Ziyao was indifferent as she said, “So, who was saying that the scumbag was too much?”

Lil’ Purple blushed and furiously said, “Y-You must’ve heard me wrongly. You guys can get married, then; I’ll help you two set up the surroundings.”

After that, Lil’ Purple glanced at Lin Yun before she fled.

“Alright. She’s fine now and will witness our wedding, bestowing the Phoenix Blessing. With the Phoenix Blessing, you will be blessed in the future,” Su Ziyao said.

Surprised, Lin Yun asked, “What did you tell her?”

Su Ziyao winked and smiled, “That’s a secret.”

Lin Yun scratched his head as he looked around for Lil’ Purple. He was genuinely curious about their earlier conversation. He was baffled about what Su Ziyao had told Lil’ Purple for her to be so passionate about becoming the witness of their wedding.

Right then, a cold hand held onto Lin Yun’s hand. Su Ziyao said, “She might be petty, but she’s rather adorable. No matter what, she will be on your side.”

“Ziyao, can you tell me why you had such a great enmity against her when you first met her?” Lin Yun asked.

“This isn’t any secret. She must’ve committed a huge sin when she still had her main body because I could see a terrifying sin on her,” Su Ziyao said after briefly pondering. “I was worried that she might have been using you… but it looks like I was worried for nothing…”

She might be saying that, but she wore a smile and continued, “How can a demoness be so adorable, and where can you find such a crybaby phoenix?”

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling when he heard that. That’s right, since when was there such an adorable demoness? No matter what, he was determined to protect Lil’ Purple well in this lifetime.

“Why did you suddenly want to marry?” Lin Yun asked.

As Su Ziyao walked, she said, “I previously asked you if the idea of never being able to see me again had crossed your mind.”

“Yeah,” Lin Yun nodded.

“I have thought of that before…” Su Ziyao continued, “I have thought we might never be able to meet again, and that you might not be able to find this place.”

As she spoke, Su Ziyao’s breathing became heavy and hurried. Despite her unyielding surface, she had a soft side in her heart. She wasn’t as strong as she looked.

Sensing the sorrow in her heart, Lin Yun tightened his grip on Su Ziyao’s hand.

After taking a few deep breaths to calm herself, Su Ziyao continued, “Ever since we parted in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, I was involved in a war here and there. As a result, I couldn’t see or help you. I feel that we still had a long time ahead of us, and that we could put aside our feelings for the time being to improve ourselves. We just had to keep getting stronger until we’re stronger than anyone in the world, and that was the motivation that kept me going. But I wavered when I fell into the Fallen God Valley… I wondered if my perseverance was a mistake and if I was going to be trapped here forever.”

As Lin Yun listened to Su Ziyao, he felt a warmth rising in his heart.

“I later figured it out. I’m not afraid of rumors or what others think of me.” Su Ziyao looked at Lin Yun, and she continued, “So let me become your wife. I’m pretty nervous…”

Su Ziyao briefly paused, then smiled, “I’m a little scared that you might not be willing.”

“What would happen if I disagreed?” Lin Yun asked.

Su Ziyao gently smiled as she got close to Lin Yun, and said, “You can give it a try.”

Her voice was soft, and she bit down on Lin Yun’s lips. As Lin Yun’s lips bled, Su Ziyao continued, “You better not think about it.”

“I naturally don’t dare to think about it, but…” Lin Yun bitterly smiled as he touched his lips.

Shaking her head, Su Ziyao said, “I know you have concerns, but it doesn’t matter because I will deal with them.”

“Just like how you’ve dealt with Lil’ Purple?” Lin Yun asked.

Su Ziyao didn’t deny that, but continued, “I have never thought of avoiding some problems. I know Yue Weiwei’s existence, and I’ve met her on the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain after I left the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. I went to borrow the Blue Dragon Record, and we fought three times. The first round was music dao, which I won. The second round was a dance, which I gave up.”

Lin Yun knew about that, but he didn’t know the details. He asked, “What about the third?”

“I let her choose the third round, but she hadn’t thought it through and placed it aside for now. But she ultimately considered it my victory and allowed me to borrow the Blue Dragon Record,” Su Ziyao said. She continued, “Those who practice the Empress Heart Sutra wouldn’t fall for someone easily. But if we do, we will remain loyal till death. It’s enough to have you in the world, and I have never thought of letting you become a heartless person.”

Lin Yun was filled with emotions, and he looked at Su Ziyao for a long time, “It’s my fortune to meet you.”

“That’s for sure, but… you can’t be complacent about it.” Su Ziyao was proud when she said that.

Lin Yun smiled because it would be weird for him not to feel complacent about it.

The two no longer spoke as they sat down to cultivate. Four hours later, Lin Yun opened his eyes first while Su Ziyao was still cultivating. She gave off an indigo radiance, enveloped in a dragon aura that made her look noble.

Looking at Su Ziyao, Lin Yun was dazed and couldn’t shift his gaze away from her.

At the same time, Lil’ Purple had decorated the entire island with flower petals, and the grass patch around the ancient tree had been cleaned up.

With a gentle breath, the petals hovered in the sky as they froze in mid-air in the form of a chill. As she gently pointed her finger, the entire ancient tree emitted a faint radiance with a peaceful aura being released from it.

Under the waterfall, the entire island became beautifully decorated by Lil’ Purple. Walking around, he felt he was in a dreamland with purple crystals hovering in the air, emitting a faint radiance.

“Scumbag, time for you to return to your senses,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

Lin Yun coughed, wearing an awkward expression as he changed the topic, “What did Ziyao tell you earlier?”

“That’s a secret,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Come and help me out. This place might be a little simple, but it still requires a sense of ceremony,” Lil’ Purple said as she held onto Lin Yun’s hand. They then began to decorate the island for the marriage.

When Su Ziyao opened her eyes, the island was completely decorated, and she looked satisfied.

“Come!” Lil’ Purple called Lin Yun and Su Ziyao over, giving them a floral crown each.

After Lin Yun took the crowns, he was shocked because the crowns were made with the branches of the Phoenix Tree, and he instantly realized that Lil’ Purple had spent a lot of effort on this marriage.

Beneath the Divine Mulberry Tree, Lil’ Purple hovered in the air, and said, “I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths… Today, we have a beloved couple getting married with me as witness. Lin Yun and Su Ziyao, are you willing to get married and love each other from today?”

“I do.” Lin Yun smiled as he placed the crown on Su Ziyao’s head; the latter smiled and placed her crown on Lin Yun’s head. This marriage was simple, without friends or a complicated ceremony. Only a phoenix hosted the ceremony, witnessing the two finally coming together after many hardships. They were bonded for eternity when they placed their crowns on each other’s heads.

“First kowtow to heaven and earth!”

“Second kowtow to the elders!” After Lin Yun and Su Ziyao kowtowed to heaven and earth, they were stumped when they heard the second part.

Lil’ Purple said seriously, “What are you guys looking at? If there isn’t anyone for you guys to kowtow at, just kowtow at me. I’m over a hundred thousand years old, and I can even be the ancestor of the two of you. Hurry up! Do you guys still want to get married?”

Lil’ Purple was doing it on purpose. This made Lin Yun and Su Ziyao feel helpless as they gave Lil’ Purple a kowtow.

“Not bad, not bad,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

When Lin Yun and Su Ziyao got up, Lil’ Purple smiled, “Third kowtow to each other!”

After they were done, Lil’ Purple fell silent as she scratched her head, “What’s next?”

“Enter the bridal chamber,” Lin Yun reminded.

“Oh, yeah! That’s right! Enter the bridal chamber!” Lil’ Purple smiled as she looked at the two with anticipation.

“That’s not something a child like you should watch…” Su Ziyao smiled as she waved her hand, unleashing a beam of light at Lil’ Purple.

When Lil’ Purple opened her eyes, she saw flower petals forming into a bridal chamber.

“I’m not a child! I just want to learn. Hmph, how stingy,” Lil’ Purple said aggrievedly.
