Chapter 542 - Pressing Forth

Everyone who was snatching the Profound Yin Flowers was surprised when they saw Lin Yun. When did Lin Yun catch up? Their confusion was natural since they clearly saw that he was blocked by Huang Ling’s party. Could it be that he dealt with Huang Ling’s party that quickly?

Just thinking about it made them even more shocked. If that was the case, then Lin Yun’s strength was a little terrifying. However, they soon directed their attention back to the flowers. After all, they couldn’t be bothered with Lin Yun right now since they had to go for the flowers. They even gloated as they looked at Gu Feng’s pale face. Gu Feng had offended many people, so no one would take pity on him.

“Big Brother Lin!” Bai Yi came over with joy on her face when she saw Lin Yun. Even Gong Ming wore a smile as he rushed over.

“Be careful next time. This fellow is right. No one will take pity on you here, at least not Senior Brother Gu,” smiled Lin Yun as he handed the flower to Bai Yi.

“Thank you, Big Brother Lin.” Bai Yi received the flower as she blushed. She then stared at Gu Feng with her cheeks puffed, “Big Brother Lin, this person came outside your residence previously and claimed that he’s more than enough to deal with you if you dared to show up.”

Bai Yi didn’t have complex thoughts. She just purely didn’t like Gu Feng. So she naturally wanted Lin Yun to teach Gu Feng a lesson.

When Gu Feng saw Bai Yi ratting him out to Lin Yun, his face became even more ugly. The humiliation he suffered was still clear in his mind and he even dreamt of stepping on Lin Yun beneath his feet. However, he ultimately endured it because he knew this wasn’t the time. He could do it after Lin Yun fought with Yang Xiong.

The killing aura in his eyes diminished and Gu Feng squeezed out a smile, “Brother Lin, I didn’t say that. She must’ve misunderstood me. I just paid you a visit out of concern and nothing else.”

“What you say doesn’t matter. Did you forget what I said a few days ago?” smiled Lin Yun.

“What did you say?” Gu Feng was briefly stunned before he remembered Lin Yun telling him that he better not see him around in the academy or he would be beaten every time. His face immediately turned pale and he smiled, “Brother Lin, you must be joking. How can you possibly be so petty with your breadth of mind…”

“I wasn’t joking with you. You can either do it yourself or I’ll help you.” The smile on Lin Yun’s face disappeared and was replaced with chill. He was never known to have a good temper, not to mention that Gu Feng clearly came to laugh at him.

“Lin Yun, don’t push it!” Gu Feng finally exploded under Lin Yun’s cold gaze. His gaze turned cold as he said, “Even a dog will bite when it’s pushed to the corner. Don’t force me!”

Gu Feng then released his aura in the greater Yin stage to attract more people’s attention.

“What you say is right, but it’s a pity that you’re not even a dog in my eyes,” said Lin Yun calmly. His words were like a cold dagger that stabbed into Gu Feng’s heart. He had always been the one bullying others, but he was being humiliated by Lin Yun right now.

What Lin Yun said meant that he was not a threat in Lin Yun’s eyes. When the nearby core disciples heard that, their lips twitched because Lin Yun was a little too ruthless to humiliate Gu Feng so badly.

“Then I hope that you won’t regret it!” Gu Feng’s eyes became sharp as he released a crimson glow from his body. His hair fluttered in the wind and his aura surged. He had once again used the forbidden technique Scarletblood Transformation.

Many core disciples nearby were shocked by this scene. Gu Feng had really gone insane. He had just used this forbidden technique five days ago and using it so quickly would leave behind hidden damages to his body.

Then again, Lin Yun would probably have trouble dealing with Gu Feng right now. Lin Yun probably never expected that Gu Feng would take it so far, but it was a pity that there was no medicine for regret in life.

In the end, Gu Feng was a disciple of the academy and Lin Yun was an outsider. So no one would care about Lin Yun’s outcome. They even hoped that Gu Feng could injure Lin Yun. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

But it was a pity that they would soon be disappointed. Lin Yun might have to use his trump cards if he faced Gu Feng a few days ago. But he was no longer the same, so it would be a source of humiliation to him if he had to use the Iris Sword Array.

“Great!” Lin Yun smiled as the Iris Flower bloomed in his violet palace. Shortly after, a powerful greater Yin stage aura exploded out from Lin Yun that left many people shocked.

“Greater Yin stage?”

“This…” But that wasn’t all. A crisp sword buzz rang out from Lin Yun as his aura combined with his xiantian sword intent. Right at this moment, his aura was close to the pinnacle Yin stage.

The boundless pressure made Lin Yun’s figure look majestic and Gu Feng’s figure look tiny. When Gu Feng sensed Lin Yun’s aura, his face changed drastically. He never expected that Lin Yun’s strength had undergone such a transformation in just six days. If he knew about it beforehand, he definitely wouldn’t dare to stand out even if his courage was multiplied by a hundred.

Just when he was about to retreat, a punch flew over that shattered the crimson radiance that covered him. Gu Feng was sent flying and he vomited a mouthful of blood. When he fell onto the surface of the lake, he was so heavily injured that he couldn’t get back up and fell into the lake.

Lin Yun had defeated Gu Feng, who had activated a forbidden technique, with one move. This was a little too powerful and even Yang Xiong couldn’t underestimate such strength. As for Gu Feng, no one paid any more attention to him. He was defeated twice by Lin Yun, not to mention the consequences of the forbidden technique. Therefore, he was destined to be useless in the future.

Before everyone could dispel the shock in their hearts, the lake began to tremble violently as spiritual energy began to gather inside the vortex. There seemed to be a colossal beast hiding in the depth of the lake absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy.

“Retreat,” said Lin Yun to Bai Yi and Gong Ming.

The two had no idea what was going on, but they still retreated out of their trust for Lin Yun. Right at this moment, flames shot out from the vortex that soared into the sky with boundless spiritual energy gathering into a pillar.

In the next second, the pillar began to spread out at a rapid speed. Bolts of lightning began to tear through the horizon along with colossal waves that surged on the lake. When the pillar spread out, many disciples were caught, which sent them flying and throwing up blood. When they landed back down, their faces were pale from their heavy injuries.

The pillar finally stopped expanding upon reaching three thousand meters. Right at this moment, three figures slowly descended from the sky. They were naturally Yang Xiong, Lu Zhan, and Qi Wenxiong. The three of them were quick, so they weren’t injured by the pillar.

When the pillar stood between the lake and horizon, the surrounding temperature began to drop with a terrifying chill spreading out. Looking at this phenomenon, everyone instantly knew that the flower king was about to appear. This scene made many people smile bitter. After all, who dared to try and obtain the flower king with this terrifying pillar standing here?

If they weren’t careful, they would be instantly injured to a great extent. Only people like Yang Xiong, Lu Zhan, and Qi Wenxiong dared to give it a try. But it was another question if they could succeed. Aside from them, no one dared to court death.

When the waves settled down, the commotion on the lake gradually settled down as everyone looked at the pillar. But right at this moment, an azure figure covered in a golden radiance charged towards the pillar. Everyone could see the sword box that he was carrying on his back.

“It’s him, Flower Burial Lin Yun!” No one expected that the first to charge out would be a guest deacon of the academy. This instantly caused an uproar on the lake as many people were shocked.
