Chapter 1629 - Who Dare Claims To Be Invincible?

Lin Yun hovered in the air as the sword box opened with a bounce, and the Flower Burial Sword flew out. He also pushed his movement technique to the limit, leaving ripples in the surroundings. He was so fast that no one could catch up with his speed, crossing a few thousand meters of distance in the blink of an eye.

Raising his hand to grab onto the Flower Burial Sword above him, Lin Yun took a step forth and appeared before Yan Kong.

“Haha! Good, come!” Yan Kong laughed with his pupils filled with insanity. Standing before the silver moon, his hair violently fluttered in the wind.

But when Lin Yun drew his sword by half an inch, it made Yan Kong squint his pupils as fear rose within his heart. He recognized Lin Yun’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, and Lin Yun used his sword intent to activate the ancient glory spirits engraved on the sword.

That was the complete Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, and everything took place too quickly. Just when he was still laughing, Yan Kong was severed into two.

As blood splashed, Lin Yun spun the sword before sheathing it. His sword was so fast that no one could keep up with it. They couldn’t comprehend why Lin Yun suddenly unleashed such a terrifying sword intent earlier, but that sword intent nearly made everyone within a thousand-mile radius go down on their knees.

Everything happened too quickly. Before everyone could be forced to their knees, Lin Yun already sheathed his sword, and that sudden pressure disappeared like a dream. When Yan Kong’s corpse fell apart, the silver moon behind him also began to crumble.

“How is this possible?”

“Yan Kong is dead?”

“Didn’t he say that he’ll become invincible after fifteen minutes? Why did he die all of a sudden?”

“This doesn’t make any sense.” Everyone was shocked, and they couldn’t comprehend what was going on. Only Mu Xueqin muttered to herself with her pupils shining brightly. She knew it must be the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, and her eyes weren’t fooling her.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun had exhausted nearly all of his dragon origin when he activated the glory spirits on the Flower Burial Sword. He also exhausted a great deal of his vitality. When the silver moon exploded, and the shockwave swept out, Lin Yun could only envelop himself with the Golden Crow Wings. After the huge explosion, Lin Yun let out a grown and flapped his wings to dissipate the remaining shockwave.

“I nearly embarrassed myself…” Lin Yun muttered to himself while lowering his head. He saw Mu Xueqin and the other Sword Sect’s disciples from the Saint Constellation Snow Valley.

Right then, an incident happened, and a person flew out from the distant collapsed mountain. This person was the Flame Phoenix Sect’s chief disciple that Lin Yun sent flying earlier. When her gaze fell onto Lin Yun, she recalled her Glory Saint Artifact before charging at Lin Yun.

“Lin Yun, I’ll kill you even if I have to pay my life as the price!” She had gone insane and executed her Glory Saint Artifact to the limit and shone with blazing flames. As she merged with the phoenix, her aura instantly reached the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm while charging at Lin Yun. Flames blazed wildly in her path, creating holes in the surrounding space.

“What a mad woman.” Lin Yun furrowed his brows and swiftly tried to devise a solution.

“Not good…” Mu Xueqin exclaimed. She could sense that Lin Yun’s condition wasn’t good, and he was barely holding on. After killing Yan Kong, the aura that reached the pinnacle started to disperse. That meant that the woman who suddenly came naturally placed Lin Yun in a dangerous position.

“Hahaha! Lin Yun, let’s die together!” The Flame Phoenix Sect’s chief disciple wore a sinister expression. Because of her hatred for Lin Yun, she had long gone insane.

But when she had just finished speaking, a white dragon appeared above the Saint Constellation Snow Valley. The white dragon was coiling around someone. When that person swung their sword, a brilliant sword vibration echoed in everyone’s ears.

That sword vibration made everyone’s hearts tremble. When the sword ray flew out, the Flame Phoenix Sect’s chief disciple was severed into two before she could even get close to Lin Yun, with countless flames scattering around like fireworks.

“Ye Ziling!” Lin Yun raised his head to look at Ye Ziling, who seemed seemed to be standing on a towering tree.

When Ye Ziling descended from the sky, the towering tree behind her shrunk in size before entering her body.

“Ancient Saint Constellation!”

“There really was an Ancient Saint Constellation in the valley! The Sword Sect’s harvest is too great this time.”

“They also blew up the matter. The war between the Profound Sky Sect and Sword Sect has officially started. I bet there will be a huge battle at the end.”

“Don’t belittle the Sword Sect. Who could’ve thought that the eight big sects would be slaughtered, and even Yan Kong would lose his life.”

“For him to be so strong, he’s truly worthy of being the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple!”

Everyone came to their senses when they saw Ye Ziling flying towards Lin Yun. What happened today was too shocking, and no one expected that this matter would resolve in this manner. Even after Yan Kong made a breakthrough in the Profound Sky Canon and reached the ninth stage, he was still killed by Lin Yun with one strike.

No words could describe their shock, making Yan Kong look like a joke. Most importantly, everyone could sense that Yan Kong wasn’t joking when he said he would be invincible after fifteen minutes. When he made that breakthrough in his cultivation technique, the aura that he was releasing reached a terrifying height.

This was why everyone was baffled at how Lin Yun managed to kill Yan Kong with one sword. They came up with various explanations, but no one could give them an exact answer.

When Lin Yun and Ye Ziling descended from the sky, they retracted their sword auras. Lin Yun winked and looked at Ye Ziling with a smile, “You save me.”

“Cut that out. I don’t believe that you didn’t have other trump cards.” Ye Ziling rolled her eyes.

The other Sword Sect’s disciples rushed over. When Mu Xueqin looked at Ye Ziling, her pupils were filled with joy and excitement.

“Junior Sister Ye, you’ve succeeded? Congratulations! The Sword Sect has obtained a massive harvest this time!” Mu Xueqin was as happy as though she was the one who refined the Saint Constellation, and her emotions soon affected the other Sword Sect’s disciples.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Thank you, Senior Sister Mu!” Ye Ziling looked at Mu Xueqin sincerely. “I have to thank everyone for protecting me while I was refining it. After we return to the sect, I’ll share the inheritance within the Saint Constellation with the sect master. There are a lot of inheritances, and I still can’t comprehend them now.”

“Hehe, no rush. It’s good that you’ve succeeded.” Mu Xueqin waved her hand.

“Senior Sister, you’re not going to praise me? I’ll be sad.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hahaha!” Mu Xueqin laughed. “Do I still need to praise you? Didn’t you praise yourself already when you yelled earlier? ‘Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple is here. Who dares to fight me?!’ We all heard it!”

“That’s right, we all heard it! Senior Brother Lin is invincible!”

“Senior Brother Lin is invincible!”

“Senior Brother Lin is invincible!” The other Sword Sect’s disciples yelled along with Mu Xueqin.

They weren’t teasing Lin Yun; their pupils were blazing with flames and admiration. They realized that Lin Yun had an invincible momentum, and he could show everyone the might of the Sword Sect.

They made Lin Yun feel awkward. The reason why he did that was because he was too anxious, and he wanted to draw Yan Kong’s attention to him. But it didn’t seem that bad.

Looking at the Sword Sect’s disciples, Lin Yun smiled because this felt pretty good. The Sword Sect would be immortal if the moon hung in the sky. He was happy because he vented all his emotions, which was how a swordsman should be.

“Everyone, split up and find the other injured fellow disciples. If you run into any corpses of our fellow disciples, keep them safe after incinerating them.” Mu Xueqin stowed her smile and gave out instructions with a grave expression. The Sword Sect still paid a great price, even though Lin Yun won.

Before Lin Yun came, many disciples had died a miserable death in the fight with the Profound Sky Sect and the eight big sects. They had already predicted that this Ancient Barren Battlefield would be brutal, but their hearts were heavy after facing the reality.

Looking at the busy Sword Sect disciples, Lin Yun’s face gradually became grave because he knew this wasn’t over.

“With Yan Kong’s death, Qin Tian probably won’t let this matter rest so easily.” Mu Xueqin said to Lin Yun.

“I’ll look for him, even if he doesn’t come and look for me. It’s time for us to resolve the blood feud from two decades ago.” Lin Yun said.

When Ye Ziling heard that, her lip twitched because she naturally knew what had happened back then. Her father was a genius from the Sword Sect back then, first on the three rankings. But he fell for a trap and could only watch the Sword Sect’s Golden Generation geniuses die. After that, he lost it and was now trapped within the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect as his prison.

“You’re not allowed to be impulsive. Big Sister Ziyao told me to look after you. Don’t underestimate Qin Tian.” Ye Ziling ultimately controlled her emotions and persuaded Lin Yun.

Lin Yun opened his mouth, but he ultimately said nothing.

“Lin Yun, did you grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent?” Mu Xueqin lowered her voice, and this made Ye Ziling shocked. The Heavenly Dome Sword Intent? How is this possible?

That was something that even many Samsara Edict Realm experts couldn’t grasp. In the eyes of many, grasping the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent was even more challenging than becoming a Quasi-Saint. But Lin Yun grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent while at the Dragon Pulse Realm? Wasn’t this a little too exaggerated?

“You probably made a mistake.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Mhm?” Mu Xueqin showed a doubtful look towards Lin Yun and muttered to herself, “Did I really make a mistake? How did you manage to swing out that sword earlier, then?”

“Didn’t he say that he’s invincible? I just tried and saw how ‘invincible’ he was. I wanted to see who would dare to claim to be invincible before Flower Burial.” Lin Yun smiled casually.
