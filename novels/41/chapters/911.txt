Chapter 912 - Swordsmen Aren't Afraid of Fights!

Lin Yun’s voice wasn’t loud, but everyone could hear him clearly as waves filled their hearts. Who was Feng Wuji? Forget about the Bloodbone Realm, he was ranked just below the top ten of the Azure Dragon Ranking. His ranking was enough to deter anyone from provoking him. To him, everyone in Glorysun Land was an ant.

After all, Feng Wuji was someone who dared to start a massacre for one Blood Sun Fruit. No one even had courage to stop Feng Wuji as they avoided his gaze.

But now, someone was actually challenging Feng Wuji and disputing his claims. It was the reason why everyone turned to look at Lin Yun.

Upon recognizing Lin Yun, a few facial expressions changed.

“It’s Lin Yun, the swordsman from the Profound Amber Realm!”

“No wonder he dares to be so bold. He’s the guy who blackmailed Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen.”

“Are you serious? Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were blackmailed by him?”

“It’s true. Not only did they have to pay two million astral pellets each, they even used a saint pellet to buy their lives.”

“What a prideful person. I heard that he cultivated the spiritual sword intent to a high level and only needed one sword to kill them.” As people started to recall Lin Yun’s accomplishments, the crowd grew more and more surprised.

However, Lin Yun was facing Feng Wuji who was on a completely different level than Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen. In fact, Feng Wuji could compete with second soul Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses and had a high possibility of making the top ten of the Azure Dragon Ranking soon.

The Azure Dragon Ranking represented the strongest 100 people in the Azure Dragon Region out of millions of geniuses. But most importantly, Feng Wuji owned a dao artifact.

The surroundings fell silent as the atmosphere became even more intense. Geniuses from higher realms like Mo Han, Shi Feng, and Chen An also directed their gazes over because Feng Wuji finally bumped into a hard nut. If Feng Wuji could suffer some losses, it would make things more interesting for them.

Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were the only ones who weren’t smiling. Since they were from the higher realms, they were extremely arrogant. However, they were defeated by Lin Yun and were even blackmailed. Afterwards, they became a laughingstock to the other higher realms.

“That fellow is really courting death by talking back to Feng Wuji.”

“Only needing one sword to kill Chen Qion and Xian Yunzhen… how arrogant. I don’t think he even has the chance to draw his sword before Feng Wuji.”

“Only trash like Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong would be defeated by him. They’re really the humiliation of the higher realms.”

“Someone like him should be taught a lesson or else he won’t place our higher realms in his eyes.” Contrary to the lower realms, the higher realm geniuses were supportive of Feng Wuji’s actions.

After all, no matter how brutal the likes of Feng Wuji and Mo Han were, they would rarely take another life from the higher realms. At most, they would teach their higher realm offenders a little lesson.

“You only need one sword?” Feng Wuji smiled mockingly. Clearly, he was treating the surrounding discussions like the biggest joke in the world. Even his killing intent became a lot fainter.

“You can try me,” said Lin Yun. The atmosphere around Lin Yun dropped to rock bottom as Feng Wuji stopped smiling. This was the first time he met such an arrogant person. I was mocking him, but he’s taking this seriously.

“Is there even a need for that? Consider it my loss if you can even draw your sword.” Violence filled Feng Wuji’s eyes as he unleashed a suffocating arrogance.

Suddenly, Chen Xuan clenched his jaw before speaking up, “I’m Chen Xuan from the Highcloud realm. I’ve heard of Brother Wuji’s name for a while now. Brother Lin offended you, but I can guarantee that he didn't take the Blood Sun Fruit.”

Highcloud Realm? Feng Wuji was briefly surprised before he snickered, “If your senior brother Mu Yan was here, I might consider giving him some face. But who do you think you are? Get lost!”

Chen Xuan’s face became nasty. But before Chen Xuan could respond, Feng Wuji barked coldly, “Say another word and I’ll start with you first.”

“Then you have to get past me!” Chen Xuan ultimately made the decision step forward. No matter what, Lin Yun had saved his life, so he couldn’t watch Feng Wuji kill Lin Yun right in front of him.

Damn it! Liu Yun clenched his fist tightly before he ultimately spoke out, “Feng Wuji, I’m the one who took the Blood Sun Fruit. Come at me if you want!”

Liu Yun knew that he couldn’t keep hiding since Chen Xuan stepped forward. So he took the Blood Sun Fruit from his interspatial pouch. When the dense spiritual energy started spreading out, everyone stared at Liu Yun’s hand.

“That’s a Blood Sun Fruit!”

“What dense spiritual energy! It must be at least a thousand years old!”

“No wonder Feng Wujis is so enraged. A fruit that old is rare even in the higher realms.” The sudden development caught many people by surprise. Even Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling surprised because he was planning to take the fall. He never would have thought that Liu Yun had the courage to stand up for himself. He truly was a swordsman.

“I didn’t steal the Blood Sun Fruit from you. I won the competition. Since everyone was competing, why don’t I have the right to it? Are you saying that all the treasures in the Heavenly Path belong to you? I don’t accept that!” Liu Yun decided to go all out since he had already reached the point of no return. The fire in his heart had been burning for a while now, so he might as well do something about it.

“Well said! Since everyone is competing, why can’t we? The Heavenly Path is a competition and swordsmen aren’t afraid of fighting!” barked Lin Yun with bright eyes.

Earlier, Lin Yun was passively taking the fall. Now, he was actively resisting Feng Wuji. Since Liu Yun had the heart of a swordsman, he didn’t want to stand by the side and watch Liu Yun die. After all, no one could claim the treasures until they earned it. Why should the geniuses from higher realms get the best treasures? Unacceptable!

Blazing fighting spirit came from Lin Yun as he stepped forward and faced Feng Wuji.

“Lin Yun…” Chen Xuan and Liu Yun were dumbfounded. They never expected that Lin Yun would choose to face Feng Wuji alone.

Up to this point, Lin Yun wouldn’t give Feng Wuji his attention. But now, he stared Feng Wuji directly in the eyes. Pridefully, he stood there as Flower Burial Lin Yun.

When Feng Wuji saw Lin Yun’s actions, killing intent surged in his pupils. He was starting to get annoyed with Lin Yun.

At this moment, everyone from Glorysun Land could feel their hearts beat wildly. They couldn’t help feeling emotional from Lin Yun’s words. Why should they resign themselves to living like an ant?

“He’s dead!”

“An ant from a lower realm dares to speak such words before Feng Wuji? He’s simply courting death!” The geniuses from higher realms looked at Lin Yun like he was already dead.

“You’re really interesting. But it’s a pity that an ant is ultimately an ant. You have no idea how terrifying the foundation of my Bloodbone Realm is. No one can escape from death if I want to kill them!” Feng Wuji had finally run out of patience.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He emitted a crimson radiance as he soared into the sky. At this moment, his killing intent and origin energy had merged together perfectly as the crimson radiance manifested into a majestic dragon that charged towards Lin Yun.

His origin energy was so massive that it exploded violently after being released. The amount of strength that Feng Wuji revealed was shocking. Clearly, he didn’t look down on Lin Yun when he attacked. In fact, it was the strongest attack he had unleashed in the Heavenly Path.

Circulating both sword sutras within his body, the massive aura ocean in Lin Yun’s violet palace started to boil. However, due to the massive power, his bones started cracking because his physique couldn’t bear the might.

Facing Feng Wuji’s attack, Lin Yun merely raised his right hand and ancient flaming seals formed on his palm. He condensed six gold flaming seals in a single breath.

When Feng Wuji saw this scene, his eyes flashed with disdain because he recognized the martial technique that Lin Yun was using. Is the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm Lin Yun’s source of confidence? At this moment, Lin Yun looked like a fool in his eyes.

The Flamecloud Incinerating Palm wasn’t even considered a top-tier fortune martial technique among the intermediate realms, not to mention the higher realms. Unless Lin Yun could condense all eight seals, the attack wouldn’t pose any threat to Feng Wuji.

“Pitiful tricks!” Feng Wuji laughed as his killing intent surging forth once more. The crimson dragon continued to condense as it coiled around his arm. He wanted to take Lin Yun’s life with a single strike.

As everyone in the surroundings noticed the change of power in Feng Wuji’s attack, fear flashed in their eyes. Unbelievably, Feng Wuji strengthened his attack even more.

“Looks like Feng Wuji is furious.”

“Lin Yun is going to die.” The geniuses from the higher realms sighed. Even Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen felt conflicted because Lin Yun provoked someone that he shouldn’t. Then again, they wouldn’t mind Lin Yun getting killed.

Just as the crowd sentenced Lin Yun to death, Lin Yun’s gold flames suddenly turned black. Then a terrifying dragon aura exploded out from Lin Yun. Along with a dragon roar, eight seals perfectly fused with the azure dragon breath and clashed with Feng Wuji’s attack.
