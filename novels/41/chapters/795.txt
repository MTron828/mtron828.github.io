Chapter 796 - I'm Not Targeting You

One had to admit that Ji Feng’s journey in the banquet was filled with tragedy. He lost to Lin Yun, but at least Lin Yun didn’t try to humiliate him on purpose. So who would have imagined that he would lose to Wu Xiaotian and get publicly humiliated?

As one of the seven elites, he had always held a high position and looked down on everything in disdain. So, Ji Feng had never suffered such humiliation before, but this was the nature of the world. Since he lost the battle, there was nothing he could do if Wu Xiaotian called him a piece of trash.

“Wu Xiaotian isn’t simple. He’s a lot stronger than I imagined. The battle might have seemed perilous, but he didn’t even use his full strength.”

“Haha, I feel like Ji Feng’s strength doesn’t fit his reputation. Not only was he defeated by Lin Yun, but he even lost to Wu Xiaotian.”

“That’s true. He’s truly the humiliation of the seven elites.”

“It’s like he’s an extra.”

Ji Feng’s face was ugly as he left the stage, especially when he heard that he was an extra among the seven elites. He might be ranked at the bottom of the seven elites, but it was too much to call him an extra. After all, he was only slightly weaker than Jue Chen. It wasn’t that he was weak, but that his opponents were too strong.

Time passed quickly and the afternoon crept up on everyone. When Lin Yun heard the surrounding cheers, he raised his head and saw a familiar figure on the second group’s stage. “Her?”

The figure was the Indigomoon Elysium’s little princess, Qing Ruoyou. When he thought about it, he hadn’t seen a single one of her fights because he was either busy or he couldn’t be bothered to watch her. Many people adored her breathtaking beauty and watched her battles, but she paled in comparison to Yue Weiwei.

However, the truth of the matter was that her strength was extraordinary. Therefore, her popularity soared throughout the course of the banquet. Lin Yun glanced at her briefly before he retracted his gaze. But suddenly, Lin Yun did a double take because Yue Weiwei was also in the second group. According to the rules, they would have to fight sooner or later.

“I guess I should watch a little.” Lin Yun directed his gaze at the stage. Qing Ruoyou’s opponent was Xu Wenbin of the Northern Snow Manor who was ranked number twenty-one. The Northern Snow Manor had great hopes for him since he had comprehended the xiantian sword intent in greater mastery. As for Qing Ruoyou, she was also ranked in the twenties, but she was lower than Xu Wenbin.

“I know your strength well,” smiled Xu Wenbin.

“I know your strength as well. You’re not as strong as everyone thinks,” replied Qing Ruoyou.

“Perhaps.” Xu Wenbin wasn’t enraged, but there was a sharp flash in his pupils. Drawing his sword, he attacked first with his attack empowered by his xiantian sword intent in greater mastery. In the blink of an eye, he unleashed a powerful blow that could send Qing Ruoyou flying.

“Indigomoon Essence!” Qing Ruoyou formed a seal with her hand and a bright moon soared into the sky before clashing with Xu Wenbin’s sword. When the two attacks clashed, a dazzling sword ray exploded.

“Again!” Xu Wenbin charged forward once more while his sword ray flew like a dragon that could obliterate mountains and rivers. His sword techniques were somewhat similar to Li Mubai.

Many people’s eyes lit up when they saw this scene. Although Xu Wenbin’s sword technique wasn’t comparable to Nangong Wanyu and Li Mubai, there weren’t many people who could defeat him.

Qing Ruoyou’s gaze became serious as her body began to fade away. Her dress fluttered in the wind while she shot beams of purple moon essence. Her attacks didn’t seem powerful, but she was able to negate Xu Wenbin’s attacks.

A few dozen moves later, Xu Wenbin was completely suppressed and the purple moon in the sky seemed to have moved quite a bit. Lin Yun noticed this small detail and instantly knew that Xu Wenbin had already lost.

“My origin energy!” Xu Wenbin suddenly discovered that his origin energy was almost completely drained. His face changed and he soared into the sky, stabbing his sword at the purple moon.

“Nothing can be hidden under the moonlight. It’s already too late.” Qing Ruoyou’s eyes flashed sharply as she pointed at the moon, causing it to burn and release a dazzling radiance. Then, her finger came in contact with Xu Wenbin’s sword ray. Suddenly, the sword ray exploded and Xu Wenbin’s shoulder was pierced, causing him to fall out of the sky.

“Wow, it looks like Qing Ruoyou can make it into the top ten.” Qing Ruoyou’s victory took her fame to a new level. Hearing the cheers, she glanced at Yue Weiwei.

This made Lin Yun frown. He was worried that Qing Ruoyou might get revenge on Lin Yun by acting brutally to Yue Weiwei. Lin Yun had no idea what would happen since he wasn’t sure about Qing Ruoyou’s personality.

The following battles advanced smoothly, but everyone was focused on the fourth group, especially since Lin Yun was in the fourth group. As the crowd’s favorite dark horse, Lin Yun’s fights would instantly attract countless gazes. With ten wins in a row, Lin Yun’s performance always delivered. Additionally, his dragon projection had also grown to twenty-one meters.

After he won his seventeenth battle, his dragon projection reached twenty-four meters in length and emitted a powerful aura. After growing so large, it was no longer illusory. The length of his dragon projection matched those within the top ten.

Lin Yun could keenly sense that the dragon aura in his dragon projection had also grown stronger and could nourish his body. He didn’t even have to meditate to recover his exhausted origin energy.

“The dragon projection is truly profound.” Lin Yun wanted to know the benefits of the champion’s dragon aura. When he left the stage, everyone looked at him with disappointment in their eyes because they wanted to see Lin Yun reply to Lin Tao’s provocation.

But Lin Yun merely fought with no intentions of revealing his strength. After all, Nangong Wanyu and Li Mubai had revealed their strength with their sword aura.

“Hmmm, it looks like Lin Yun has given in.”

“It makes sense. Lin Tao’s phenomenon was too terrifying.”

“Damn it. Do we have to watch Lin Tao act so arrogant?”

“There’s nothing we can do about it. Lin Yun’s foundation is weaker. But even if he lost three rounds, he still has high odds of being promoted. However, his profound amber aura will be exhausted.” Many people sighed with sadness.

At this moment, the Profound Yang Palace’s disciples were smiling. “Senior brother, looks like Lin Yun has given in.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“What else can he do? Does he really dare to fight senior brother? If senior brother can’t become the seeded candidate, he will definitely cripple Lin Yun and make him lose any chance of being promoted.”

Lin Tao wore a sneer on his face when he saw Lin Yun act tactfully. If they really fought, it would only benefit Nangong Wanyu and Li Mubai, which would cause him to lose the quota. So it was good that Lin Yun gave in or else he would be ruthless towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly. He couldn’t ignore everyone talking because of his keen senses. The fact of the matter was that he was hiding his strength. Throughout the entire banquet, he would obtain victories by revealing as little strength as possible. He never thought that going at his own pace would cause so much controversy.

“Lin Yun, are you really going to give up on the quota? It’s alright. Lord Thirteen and the Old Pavilion Master would be happy with your current achievements. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself,” smiled Pavilion Master Plum because he didn’t want to add any pressure on Lin Yun.

Lin Yun opened his mouth, but he ultimately said nothing. There weren’t many rounds left, so he would run into Lin Tao, Li Mubai, and Nangong Wanyu sooner or later.

Several rounds later, the judge’s voice sounded out, “Fourth group, Lin Yun VS Lin Tao.”

The moment the announcement was made, a commotion broke out and the crowd waited for Lin Yun’s answer. Even Yu Haotian, Yan Long’zi, and the others in the top ten turned to look at Lin Yun. After all, they wanted to see if Lin Yun’s undefeated journey would come to an end.

Lin Tao maintained his composure as if he knew what decision Lin Yun would make. He was just waiting for Lin Yun to give up this match.

However, the unthinkable was happening. Lin Yun immediately walked onto the stage without any hesitation. He was so quick that he had already drawn his sword before anyone could react.

Lin Tao’s smile froze and his fank sank. He gnashed his teeth angrily and asked, “Lin Yun, are you determined to go against me and make sure I can’t obtain the quota?”

Lin Yun pondered briefly before he replied, “Yes, but I’m not targeting you specifically.”

He really wasn’t targeting Lin Tao, but rather the entire fourth group. He wouldn’t let anyone stand in his way since he was determined to get the quota.
