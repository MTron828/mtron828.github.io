Chapter 2062 - Gu Zijing

Gu Zijing descended from the sky and tore the clouds apart. When he looked around, everyone could feel a pressure on their shoulders.

“Stars from the thirty-six layers of heaven,” Gu Zijing said. As the sky shattered, starlight shone and formed a galaxy around him. Gu Zijing also possessed the Astral Sword Intent at lesser mastery, but his Astral Sword Intent was much stronger than Zhao Wuji. He was half a step from condensing his galaxy and reaching greater mastery. As his Astral Sword Intent enveloped him, Gu Zijing seemed like a sharp sword.

“The pinnacle lesser mastery Astral Sword Intent! Gu Zijing is finally standing out!”

“If he didn’t stand out, the Sword Assembly would be swept up by an outsider again, just like two decades ago.”

When Gu Zijing landed on the lake, he became the center of the world with a domineering aura sweeping out.

Lin Yun raised his head to look at Gu Zijing. Because Gu Zijing was in a carriage during their previous meeting, Lin Yun couldn’t take a closer look at him. Now that he looked at Gu Zijing, he noticed that Gu Zijing had an extraordinary temperament, which should be his identity as the Ice Emperor’s disciple. Since he often cultivated with an emperor, he naturally had some of that emperor’s aura on him.

Gu Zijing looked at Lin Yun and smiled, “I’m the direct disciple of an Emperor, and I shouldn’t make a move against you by right. But you’ve displayed shocking talent, and you can also become an Emperor’s disciple if you want. So there’s nothing unfair about me fighting you now.”

Gu Zijing’s evaluation of Ye Qingtian was high, and his composure showed confidence. He smiled, “I have a question for you. I have roughly figured it out but I still wanted to verify it. Unlike others, I’m the disciple of the Ice Emperor, and I believe we will benefit from this fight.”

Gu Zijing’s confidence made Lin Yun raise his guard. He could sense a threat coming from Gu Zijing, which others didn’t possess, not to mention Gu Zijing chose to stand out even after witnessing his strength. Since that was the case, Gu Zijing must have felt that he was stronger.

“I hope so.” Lin Yun recollected himself and focused his attention on Gu Zijing. He had a feeling that this battle would be dangerous.

With no intentions of talking any further, Gu Zijing took a step forth after hearing what Ye Qingtian said. When boundless nirvana aura poured into his feet, the entire lake began to tremble, and he instantly appeared before Lin Yun, stabbing his sword.

This wasn’t an afterimage. Sparks flew when Lin Yun drew his sword to face the incoming attack. Furthermore, Lin Yun was shocked by Gu Zijing’s speed.

Lin Yun and Gu Zijing disappeared. Their speed was so fast that it was hard for others to follow. When they found Ye Qingtian and Gu Zijing again, the two had already clashed a third time, but they were still trying to process the second clash in their minds.

This gave them a sense of separation, as if time had slowed down.

Sparks flew when the two swords clashed, and Lin Yun executed the Flicking Divine Finger, dividing his mind into two. His left thumb pressed down on his finger that looked like a fully stretched bow with a dazzling sword ray shining from his finger. When Lin Yun circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, Netherflowers bloomed on the lake, instantly turning the surrounding area into a sea of flowers.

“Dragon Sealing Finger!” Gu Zijing made a seal with his left hand and the sword ray bloomed with the appearance of golden runes before he pointed at Lin Yun.

When the two sword rays clashed, the collision produced a loud explosion. The swords in their hands were sent flying away while they remained standing where they were, as though nothing could affect them.

The two continued to fight at lightning speed, with their palms and fists clashing together, creating huge waves on the lake. The two swords that flew away also clashed, even when no one held them. The two swords surrounded Lin Yun and Gu Zijing, executing various unbelievable sword techniques.

This shocked everyone because their fight was dangerous, and they would lose if they weren’t careful. While Lin Yun and Gu Zijing fought, their swords fought on another battlefield.

“Soaring Double Dragon!” Gu Zijing shook his wrist and unleashed two dragons from the lake. The dragons coiled around his arms before roaring towards Lin Yun, unleashing a divine dragon aura. At the same time, Wind and Water Intent perfectly fused, empowering Gu Zijing’s sword aura. This move couldn’t be avoided because he had perfectly made use of the environment, the lake.

Lin Yun was sent flying away, before taking several steps back on the lake.

“Come again!” Gu Zijing smiled and waved his hand, causing huge waves to rise from his feet. When Gu Zijing threw his punches out, the surroundings were filled with dragon and sword vibrations.

Everyone could see that the entire lake was covered with sword rays, divine dragons, wind, and water that brought along a powerful pressure. This surprised Lin Yun because Gu Zijing had reached a high level with his martial intent. Not only could he take advantage of his environment, but he could also fuse his mental pressure into his attacks, making his attacks impossible to defend against.

“Soaring Myriad Swords!” Gu Zijing laughed as he grabbed his sword and swung it down with both hands.

A white dragon fused into Gu Zijing’s sword aura, giving off an aura that could split the sky apart.

Lin Yun waved his hand to recall the Flower Burial Sword and turned around, avoiding the frontal impact of the incoming attack before spreading his arms apart and retreating. As he retreated, Lin Yun unleashed sword rays to destroy the incoming attack. Even so, many parts of his body became red.

“You won’t be able to leave!” Gu Zijing laughed and held onto the saint sword with his right hand, chasing after Lin Yun.

“Myriad Swords Unite!” Lin Yun dashed forth.

“You can’t block my attack!” Gu Zijing was confident as he laughed, and his sword intent changed. Gu Zijing broke up his sword aura. It might seem filled with flaws at a glance, but there weren’t any flaws, and it was accompanied by a momentum that could seal the sky.

This sword knocked Lin Yun away, sending him flying a few hundred meters away. When Lin Yun landed on the lake again, Gu Zijing was already charging over, so Lin Yun had no choice but to face the incoming attack head-on. They were moving rapidly with sword images around them.

One could discover that Gu Zijing didn’t pay much attention to the intent when compared to Zhao Wuji. Gu Zijing only retained the foundation, thus giving more varieties in his sword that put Lin Yin in a difficult position.

“Break!” Starlight shone from Gu Zijing’s pupils. His eyes became so bright, it was as though he could see through the flaws of every attack.

After breaking the incoming sword, Gu Zijing held onto the sword again and poured his nirvana aura into his sword, unleashing a sword ray of a few hundred feet.

Two splashes rose on both sides as the lake was ripped open. Lin Yun was forced to retreat again. This surprised Lin Yun because Gu Zijing seemed to know him well, as though he could see the future.

Aside from that, there was something weird with Gu Zijing’s eyes. After grasping Astral Sword Intent, this was the first time Lin Yun ran into such a tough opponent, and even Jin Xuanyi couldn’t be compared to Gu Zijing.

Lin Yun retreated before manifesting into a bright sun, forcibly breaking free from this place. As he spun in mid-air, Lin Yun landed on the shackles that connected the statues with the giant sword.

Gu Zijing stood with his hands behind him and smiled, “Surprised? I was just lucky because you exposed too much of your strength. My Myriad Astral Eye has analyzed your sword techniques a few hundred times within my mind.”

Lin Yun stood on the shackles and fell into deep thought as he looked at Gu Zijing. He knew Gu Zijing must’ve guessed that he possessed the Sword Heart and knew some flaws in his sword technique. This kind of opponent was really troublesome because he could easily defeat his opponent if it was someone like Zhao Wuji.

But that wasn’t all of Lin Yun’s trump cards, and it wasn’t easy for Gu Zijing to use him as a stepping stone.

“Brother Gu, well done!”

“Brother Gu, make him beg for mercy! Teach him a lesson that the Sword Alliance isn’t a pushover!”

“So this is the Ice Emperor’s disciple. Those from the Eastern Desolation don’t know how much that title weighs!” Everyone from the Sword Alliance present finally vented the suppressed emotions in their hearts.

“I’m sorry, but I have to win this battle, no matter what. This battle doesn’t only concern the Sword Alliance’s glory but my master’s glory as well. I will apologize if there’s an opportunity in the future.” Gu Zijing felt that victory was already within his grasp. As he stomped on the lake, he dashed out like a comet, charging at Lin Yun. The sword in his hand was like a divine dragon raising its head, releasing a roar with sword aura gushing out, sealing everything in the path of his sword.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes and couldn’t notice any flaws in Gu Zijing’s attack. The incoming sword had isolated him from the outside world. There wasn’t an earth-shattering phenomenon, but this attack was lethal.

He still had many means in his hands, but he couldn’t even budge. This made Lin Yun feel helpless as he spread his arms apart. He began to move in circles as Gu Zijing’s sword approached, pointed at his brows like a dragon chasing after him. No matter how Lin Yun tried, it looked like Lin Yun was a dragon that was about to be killed by Gu Zijing’s sword.

Lin Yun spread his arms like a celestial crane, surrounding the giant sword, and soared to the sky. No matter how long Gu Zijing’s attack chased after Lin Yun, he couldn’t break free from the sword aura, no matter how he tried. It was so much so that Lin Yun’s sword aura was constantly being corroded, and he had no path of retreat.

“Ye Qingtian, you can’t hold back your Sky Incineration Flames. I can control my sword as I wish, and the name of this sword is Sealing Dragon! This is a move created by the Ice Emperor, and you can be proud to be destroyed by this attack!” Gu Zijhing smiled.

Many people nodded when they saw this attack. This was how the Ice Emperor’s disciple should be like.

But Lin Yun only felt that Gu Zijing really knew how to put on an act, mentioning his identity as the Ice Emperor’s disciple from time to time. Once or twice was fine, but Lin Yun couldn’t hold back after being told so many times.

Lin Yun activated the Azure Dragon Sword Heart with his accumulating Astral Sword Intent.

This scene stunned Gu Zijing because Ye Qigntian still had no intentions of admitting defeat, but he wasn’t in a hurry because he would soon corner Ye Qingtian. At that time, Ye Qingtian's injuries would increase from the accumulation of his sword aura.

“I’m sorry!” When Lin Yun landed on the giant sword’s hilt, Gu Zijing’s attack exploded and aimed towards Lin Yun’s forehead. Gu Zijing was done accumulating his attack. Just when a hole was about to appear on Lin Yun’s forehead, an unexpected scene occurred. Gu Zijing’s accumulated sword aura exploded.

A deafening sound echoed that shocked everyone, and they couldn’t figure out what happened.

A dazzling silver sword ray shone from Lin Yun as he stood on the giant sword, especially the dazzling radiance from his chest. It looked like a genuine heart that was beating, and no one dared to directly look at Lin Yun.

“Sword Heart!”

“How is it possible?!”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“He has grasped the Sword Heart while being at the Nrivana Stage?!” Everyone present was dumbfounded, with their jaws dropping. But that wasn’t all. A silver dragon flew out from Lin Yun’s heart.

When Gu Zijing raised his head, he noticed that the region he was in had instantly become dangerous. The tables were turned around, and Lin Yun had isolated himself from the outside world. Compared to everyone else, Gu Zijing was even more shocked and couldn’t believe that this was real.

“I know you’ve guessed that I’ve grasped the Sword Heart, but I bet you didn’t expect my Sword Heart to reach the Spiritual Stage,” Lin Yun smiled, leaving Gu Zijing shocked.

When Gu Zijing raised his head, he felt as though he had only seen the tip of the iceberg.
