Chapter 2155 - I’ll Let You Have Three Swords (1)

Despite the fact that the situation was unfavourable to Tian Gu, he didn’t panic, and charged forth with a sneer.

“Great, come!” Tian Gu couldn’t execute his bizarre movement technique, so he could only clasp his hands together and enveloped himself in a silver energy barrier. There were countless black runes flowing on the silver barrier, making the barrier look fortified.

Even so, Tian Gu failed to block the beam of light. The beam of light managed to create a hole on the silver energy barrier, piercing through his chest.

At the same time, the Canaan Hall’s holy son, who executed the Great Roc Wings, descended from the sky. His hands were like sharp claws that tore apart the silver energy barrier around Tian Gu.

When Tian Gu suffered a great loss, he staggered and the Canaan Hall’s holy son took this opportunity to charge over. Accompanied with the cry of a great roc, two golden claws appeared at the left and right of Tian Gu, sandwiching him within.

Tian Gu swiftly reacted by immediately dodging the claws. But he failed to avoid them entirely since the claws left multiple wounds on his body.

“Not bad!” Tian Gu sneered. “Back then, those from the Buddhist Cult couldn’t be underestimated, and you managed to learn some of their inheritance.”

“Still trying to put on a strong front?” The Canaan Hall’s holy son snorted and charged forth. His eyes flashed coldly with his fighting spirits boiling. The outcome might be uncertain if he fought Gu Xinyu, but he was confident in dealing with a Demonspirit. This was because the Canaan Scripture was the bane of the Demonspirit Clan, capable of suppressing their bloodline.

“I’m not trying to put on a strong front, and it’s true that you only learned some of their inheritance.” Tian Gu grinned before his body gradually merged with space, creating a ripple in the surrounding space.

Seeing that Tian Gu was using this move again, the Canaan Hall’s holy son sneered and unleashed another attack with the Canaan Saint Finger. The surrounding space froze and Tian Gu was slowly forced to emerge under the Buddhist chant.

“This method is useless to me!” After the surrounding space froze, the Canaan Hall’s holy son charged over. His movement was accompanied by the cry of a roc as he charged over.

This time, Tian Gu was ripped into pieces. But the face of Canaan Hall’s holy son soon changed because he discovered that the Tian Gu he ripped apart was only an afterimage. He immediately sensed that something wasn’t right and quickly turned around. It was just as he had expected. Ripples had appeared in the surrounding space with Tian Gu appearing as though he had just teleported, pushing his palm forth.

When Tian Gu and the Canaan Hall’s holy son clashed, a holy radiance shone from the Canaan Hall’s holy son’s chest. It should be the Canaan Saint Bone. On the other side, Tian Gu was enveloped in silver radiance. Both sides were evenly matched as they clashed.

Followed by a loud explosion, Tian Gu and the Canaan Hall’s holy son separated from each other. But before they could stabilize themselves, they clashed again.

At this moment, everyone finally noticed that the movement technique used by the Canaan Hall’s holy son was profound. After all, Tian Gu had already used a spatial secret technique, but he still couldn’t gain the upperhand in the fight.

“Tian Gu is doomed now. He’s being completely suppressed.”

“The Canaan Scripture is the bane of Demonspirits, disabling them from fully unleashing the power of their bloodline. So Tian Gu is no different from a joke!” Everyone was excited when they saw this scene. They were emotional because there was finally someone capable of teaching Tian Gu a lesson for his arrogance.

But the Canaan Hall’s holy son couldn’t smile. Tian Gu’s physique might not be as terrifying as Gu Xinyu, but his recovery ability was horrifying. In just such a short moment, the hole on Tian Gu’s chest was already regenerated. Meanwhile, the injuries on the Canaan Hall’s holy son were slowly increasing, and he would gradually lose the upperhand in the fight as time passed; it wouldn’t take long for him to be defeated.

“Not good! I have to bring out my trump card!” The situation of the Canaan Hall’s holy son was terrible, and he was prepared to execute his trump card, which was to fully activate the power contained within the Canaan Saint Bone.

But right at that moment, Tian Gu sensed what the Canaan Hall’s holy son was planning to do. As a silver radiance bloomed on his forehead, a vertical eye opened up. This was a silver eye, and the Canaan Hall’s holy son was horrified to discover that he was immobilized when the vertical eye opened up.

But before he could have other thoughts, Tian Gu already charged over. Tian Gu was decisive in his attacks and his palm landed on the head of the Canaan Hall’s holy son.

The holy radiance enveloping the Canaan Hall’s holy son shattered. But Tian Gu didn’t stop there and pushed his palm forth at the Canaan Hall’s holy son’s chest. This made the Canaan Hall’s holy son throw out a mouthful of blood as he was sent flying away. The holy radiance that he gave off had already died out, along with the great roc phenomenon that he summoned.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

As the silver eye slowly closed up on Tian Gu’s forehead, the latter smiled, “The Canaan Scripture is powerful. It might be useless against the ordinary cultivators of my race, but it’s barely enough to deal with me.”

This scene made everyone’s faces change. This was because no one had expected that the Canaan Hall’s holy son, who held the advantage in the battle just a moment ago, would be defeated in the next second.

“You’re a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit! The power of your bloodline has reached the Heavenly Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm!” Gu Xiyan’s face changed, and he said something that no one else dared to say, not even the other divine dragon lords.

After reaching the Heavenly Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm, one would be able to grasp the sacred flame that belonged to them. This also meant that Quasi-Saints at the Heavenly Origin Phase were ten times stronger than Quasi-Saints at the Indigo Origin Phase.

Above the clouds, the face of the official standing beside Mu Xueling was ugly as she said, “Tian Gu must possess the bloodline of the royal clan!”

“Bloodline of the royal clan?” Many people were shocked when they heard that.

“The Demonspirit Clan sent a member of their royal bloodline just for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position?”

“Isn’t he a little too bold? Didn’t they think of the possibility of dying here?”

“Is there really no one capable of stopping him?”

“I’m afraid that even if the divine dragon lords make a move, they would be more or less evenly matched with Tian Gu. Their victory is uncertain unless they join forces.” Everyone began to discuss amongst themselves with their faces becoming ugly. After all, if they could only win with the seven divine dragon lords joining forces together, it could be considered their failure. Even if they won, their victory wouldn’t be convincing and glorious. Not to mention that there was Gu Xinyu around.

“Damn it! What should we do now?”

“The Canaan Hall’s holy son is already very strong, but even he is incapable of inflicting heavy injuries to Tian Gu. It looks like there’s nothing we can do to him.” Not only was everyone inside and outside the dragon mountain feeling anxious, the divine dragon lords on the various Dragon’s Heads had locked their brows together as they fell into deep thoughts.

After all, even they weren’t confident in beating Tian Gu unless they ganged up on him. Even if they managed to win by luck, they would be heavily injured as the price, and there would be nothing in it for them.
