Chapter 1039 - Don't Look Down On Me Just Because Of My Age

Lin Yun left decisively, but the lake was still split in half. It was almost as if an invisible force was preventing it from going back to normal. Those who were cultivating in the lake sensed the powerful sword intent. In their opinion, the lake was now a forbidden zone unless Lin Yun’s sky sword intent dissipated.

Many people began to exclaim at the power of Lin Yun’s sky sword intent. As for He Qianfan, he was ignored by everyone. After leaving the plaza, Lin Yun’s face sank as a boundless killing aura accumulated in his eyes. Clearly, he wasn’t as calm as he looked.

Suddenly, Lin Yun came to a stop, which surprised Pei Xue. “What’s wrong?” asked Pei Xue.

“Someone is staring at us,” he responded.

“Is it the three war realms?” she wondered.

Lin Yun shook his head in response. He could sense that the owner of the gaze was unbelievably powerful. Naturally, the powerful sects were giving him a warning.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun left without any hesitation. When they returned to the courtyard, they were surprised to see someone waiting for them here. It was an extraordinary looking person who was donned in golden armor engraved with a dragon.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes and instantly knew that this person was from a war realm. Furthermore, the aura he was giving off was similar to the generals that Lin Yun killed. Lin Yun could tell that he wasn’t hostile, which meant that he was from the Imperial Diagram War Diagram. Clearly, he was here for Pei Xue.

“He’s here for you,” said Lin Yun.

Pei Xue’s face changed slightly when she saw this person. Right at this moment, the youth spoke in a respectful tone, “Miss Xue, the Realm Son sent me here for you.”

“I’m not going!” Pei Xue bit on her lips with a decisive expression.

“You don’t have a choice. The Realm Son already knows about the Demon Slaughtering Assembly. Plus, there’s no point in staying with someone who’s determined to die.” The youth replied with a straight face.

Lin Yun was surprised and took a better look at the youth. However, he didn’t say anything and maintained his composure. Although he didn’t have a favorable impression of the war realms, he wouldn’t say anything about Pei Xue’s friends.

“What’s wrong? You don’t believe me?” The youth asked. “The foundation of a war realm isn’t as simple as you think. You’ll know what the Ten War Realms represent when you get to the Kunlun Realm. No one can occupy a war realm without the support of a powerful clan. Plus, the inheritance of the clans who own a war realm far exceeds your imagination.

“The means of the Realm Sons also exceeds your imagination. You’ll die if you go to the execution and you’ll be crippled if you don’t. Flower Burial is known for his loyalty for his friends, which is why he achieved so much in the path of the sword. However, this will hold you back if Yue Weiwei dies. This situation could easily become a demon in your heart, stopping you from making any progress in your cultivation.”

“He’s an extraordinary talent though,” replied Pei Xue.

“So what if he’s an extraordinary talent?” The youth asked. “Which one of the ten Realm Sons isn’t an extraordinary talent? The Demon Slaughtering Assembly is a trap and he has no choice but to go. However, the outcome has already been determined.

“He’s too young to deal with the Realm Sons. You have no idea how tough it is to become a Realm Son. They’re at a level that someone like him can’t resist. Not only do you need fortune and strength in the Heavenly Path, but you also need schemes,” explained the youth.

“Pei Xue, leave,” replied Lin Yun calmly.

“Pig, what are you saying?” Pei Xue was baffled when she heard that.

“You’re holding me back and it’s troublesome for you to stay with me. I also don’t wish for you to be involved in this matter,” replied Lin Yun.

When Pei Xue heard that, her body began to tremble, “Then why did you save me…”

“I saved you because you gave me news about Yue Weiwei. Otherwise, how would I know about the secrets of the Divine Blood Fruit?” Lin Yun merely glanced at Pei Xue before entering the courtyard with Lil’ Red. But just when he was about to enter, he glanced at the youth and smiled, “Normally, I would leave you alone, but I don’t have a favorable opinion about the war realms right now. Plus, you’re annoying.”

Then, Lin Yun pushed his palm out against the youth, infusing the essence of a holy spirit martial technique into it. Facing Lin Yun’s palm, the youth felt the entire world become dark, which made his face change drastically. He instantly retaliated with dozens of palms as he retreated several steps. He also activated the power of the dao armor to resist Lin Yun’s attack.

Just like that, the youth took nine steps backwards and threw out over a hundred palms. But all his efforts were futile because Lin Yun’s attack was too powerful. When he took nine steps back, Lin Yun’s palm landed on his armor and sent him flying. In the end, he threw up a mouthful of blood.

“Extraordinary talents cannot be provoked, and you really have a huge temper,” smiled the youth. “But am I not right? Going to Wind Mound City only means death.”

“You’re right, but what has it got to do with me giving you a beating?” Lin Yun raised his hand and pushed his palm forward.

The youth’s face changed because he was heavily injured despite the dao armor. If he took another palm, he would be heavily injured. But Lin Yun’s attack was fast and had already reached him. This made the youth shut his eyes because everything happened too quickly.

Cracks began to spread out on his armor, but he still wasn’t injured. Although he wasn’t injured, he couldn’t help feeling scared. This time, he no longer dared to be disrespectful and said, “Thank you.”

“Get lost. Take that woman with you.” Lin Yun said while waving his hand and entering the courtyard.

The youth wore a solemn expression while he looked at Lin Yun’s back. He knew that Lin Yun was worthy of his respect. However, he shook his head.

“What did you have to make it sound so bad?” Pei Xue raged while she looked at the youth.

The youth fell silent. Right at this moment, a voice sounded out as a figure walked over from the street outside the courtyard, “I asked him to do so.”

“Realm Son!” The youth immediately bowed. It was the Imperial Diagram War Realm’s realm son, an expert on the gold ranking.

Pei Xue’s face changed, “You’re afraid that I’ll implicate the Imperial Diagram War Realm if I’m with him?”

“Of course,” replied the Realm Son. “Now, we’ve confirmed that the holy maiden is fine and we’ve successfully obtained the Divine Blood Fruit. Plus, there’s no need to make enemies out of three war realms.”

“So your scheme was for him to chase me away?” Pei Xue wore a mocking smile right now.

“I guess. Speaking of which, I owe him a favor now. If he asked me for help, I might have obliged. But based on his personality, he’ll make a decision after I’m honest with him because you two are friends,” smiled the Imperial Diagram Realm Son.

His eyes flashed with intelligence before he sighed, “He’s just a young man that’s getting toyed with by the Realm Sons. He’s not suitable for the Heavenly Path. Clearly, he’s too young and inexperienced.”

“He did that because of me,” said Pei Xue.

“No,” replied the Realm Son. “Even I’m tempted by his Azure Dragon True Bone. It’s only a matter of time before the other Realm Sons target him. Plus, there’s the matter of his relationship with Yue Weiwei. This is fated and it has nothing to do with you.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“He saved my life!” Pei Xue finally cried out because she wanted to charge back into the courtyard. At this moment, she was determined to help Lin Yun even if she had to die. But when she got close, the doors suddenly closed.

“Pig, open the doors!” Pei Xue yelled.

Looking at this scene, the Imperial Diagram Realm Son sighed, “Looks like he only thinks of you as a friend. Holy maiden, let’s go. You don’t belong here. He was doomed from the start.”

No matter how Pei Xue struggled, she was ultimately taken away by the Imperial Diagram Realm Son.

Meanwhile, the courtyard was empty as Lin Yun clenched his fist tightly.
