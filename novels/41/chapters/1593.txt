Chapter 1594 - Heavenly Dome Sword Intent

A brief moment of shock later, Lil’ Purple returned to Lin Yun’s side with Lil’ Red. Lin Yun’s eyes were shut, and he only opened his eyes after his aura calmed down. Looking at Lil’ Purple, he winked, “You’re not going to congratulate me?”

“Heaven is blind not to kill a scumbag like you.” Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes.

“If I’m dead, no one will help you gather True Dragon Saint Liquid.” Lin Yun smiled while knocking on Lil’ Purple’s head.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Hmph, I don’t care about that.” Lil’ Purple turned her head away.

“Congratulations, Big Brother! Big Brother, have a fruit!” Lil’ Red was excited as it took out a spiritual fruit and gave it to Lin Yun.

“It’s fragrant!” Lin Yun was surprised after taking a bite because the vitality contained within this spiritual fruit was massive. The boundless vitality had instantly replenished his exhausted vitality to nearly 90%.

“Hehe.” Lil’ Red grinned happily.

“Lil’ Red is the best.” Lin Yun rubbed Lil’ Red’s head and speculated that this fruit was probably retrieved from the Withered Mountain Range.

“When are you planning to return to the Sword Sect?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Not so soon. I have a huge harvest from this tribulation, and just the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent will take me some time to get used to it. Moreover, I’ve yet to refine the four ominous auras to bring the Wind, Fire, Lightning, and Ice Sword Forms to greater mastery.” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered with flames blazing in the depth of his pupils.

His cultivation had previously limited him. Now that he had made a breakthrough, everything went smoothly, and he only needed time to get used to everything.

“You’re preparing to head to the Ancient Barren Battlefield after returning to the sect?” Lil’ Purple asked.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned because it was unlike Lil’ Purple to ask such a question. He nodded, “You don’t want me to go to the Ancient Barren Battlefield?”

“Obviously?” Lil’ Purple said, rolling her eyes.

As Lin Yun fell silent, Lil’ Purple sighed and rubbed her forehead, “I only care about your life and death. The Sword Sect has nothing to do with me, but I won’t interfere with your decision. I know I won’t be able to make you change your mind, and I can understand why you made this decision.”

Lin Yun smiled upon hearing that. Everyone had their principles. Lil’ Purple won’t interfere with him, and he won’t interfere with her.

“But I can’t watch you put yourself in danger and do nothing. So…I plan to let the Demonic Rune Tiger bring me to the Myriad Demon Peak.” Lil’ Purple said.

Hearing that made Lin Yun furrow his brows, and his heart sank. Wasn’t the Myriad Demon Peak an ancient forbidden ground deep in the Withered Mountain Range? That was where the Demonic Rune Tiger took that stone monument from. There must be ancient secrets concerning the Demon Clan there, but there was also unimaginable horror.

After all, a Great Saint stepped in there and failed to come out. This further made the Myriad Demon Peak a dangerous ground, and no expert was willing to step inside.

“Are you serious?” The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched because he naturally didn’t wish for Lil’ Purple to head there. He knew what Lil’ Purple meant, and she wanted to go to the Myriad Demon Peak to increase her strength faster. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to help Lin Yun if a conflict with the Profound Sky Sect broke out. But the Myriad Demon Peak was too dangerous!

“Don’t even think about it. I won’t let you go there.” Lin Yun said with a grave expression.

But Lil’ Purple briefly looked at Lin Yun before she replied, “You can’t stop me, just like how I won’t stop you.”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled upon hearing that because he knew he couldn’t stop Lil’ Purple. But he didn’t give up that easily and tried to persuade her, “I have the Firmament Saint Cloth that can ensure my safety.”

“Don’t. If you’re not confident that you can kill Tian Xuanzi with it, I don’t suggest you bring it out. That item is too powerful. So I don’t advise you to use it unless you can kill Tian Xuanzi.” Lil’ Purple shook her head with a solemn expression.

Breathing out a sigh, Lin Yun said, “Then promise me that you will come out of the Myriad Demon Peak alive!”

“I promise I’ll make it out alive and rush to the Ancient Barren Battlefield. But you also have to promise to come out alive.” Lil’ Purple said as they both looked at each other, and she smiled, “Don’t be such a narcissist. I have my reasons for going to the Myriad Demon Peak. I might be able to find some memories that I’ve lost. Secondly, there’s something that can boost my strength.”

“I’m curious. Isn’t that place a forbidden ground of the Demon Clan?” Lin Yun asked.

“What do you think is the difference between the Demon Clan and Beast Clan?”

“What is it?”

“The Demon Clans are demonic beasts that can take human form, while the Beast Clans are humans that can take the beast form. They can be considered one. Since that place has the Dragon Clan’s ancient monument, and it might have one from the Phoenix Clan.” Lil’ Purple explained.

“I understand.” Lin Yun nodded.

“You must be careful because I don’t know what happened back then. I can only be sure that a hundred years ago, that battle involved all the experts in this world…” Lil’ Purple said, looking at Lin Yun with concern.

Lin Yun’s heart sank when he heard that, recalling the demonic corpses he saw at the White Dragon Palace when he returned in time. He had no idea if these two were connected.

“There were many battlefields back then, and the Ancient Barren Battlefield is only one of them. It might be dangerous, but also a place filled with treasures. Many experts fell along with countless saint palaces. If you’re fortunate enough, you might be able to obtain a huge opportunity.” Lil’ Purple said before she wore a serious expression and continued, “There must be a reason why so many people die every time the battlefield opens.”

Hearing what Lil’ Purple said, Lin Yun nodded his head. The challenge he faced this time was unprecedented.

“When are you going to leave?” Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple.

“Right now. I’ll bring Lil’ Red with me and see if I can find an inheritance suitable for it. Who knows, it might be able to receive a greater opportunity than me.” Lil’ Purple said after a brief pondering.

“Alright.” Lin Yun nodded. Even if she didn’t ask for it, he would have wanted Lil’ Red to follow her.

“Let us part here, then. Do you still remember our agreement? Everyone has to be alive. We must do our best to help each other, regardless of what we face.” Lil’ Purple smiled and stretched her fist out. She wasn’t selfish and would often wonder why this youth would be engraved in her heart.

Aside from the fact that he was genuinely good to her, wasn’t it also because his backbone wouldn’t bend, no matter what he faced? Under his unyielding surface, there was a pure heart that nothing could taint. She wouldn't have thought highly of him if he had heeded her words and did not go to the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

Since that was the case, she wouldn’t be selfish to ask him to stay alive in a pathetic manner and do her best to help him. Life and death were important, but many things, such as relationships, were more important than life and death. Even a young man like Lin Yun could comprehend that, so why couldn’t she?

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he bumped fists with her, and they both smiled. While watching Lil’ Purple leaving behind the four ominous auras along with a scroll, Lin Yun picked the scroll up and asked, “What music score is this?”

“Nine Heavens. It tells the story of an invincible Heavenly Dragon wandering in the nine heavens. You can also call it the Heavenly Dragon Score. Since you’re already familiar with Song of the Phoenix, you can try and learn this. When I’m back, I’ll teach you the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Score.”

“Big Brother, we’ll definitely come back and look for you!” Lil’ Red gave Lin Yun a wink before turning into a streak of light with Lil’ Purple and disappearing into the woods.

Lin Yun looked in the direction they left in for a long time before he recollected himself. This was the first time Lil’ Purple had left him since she woke up, along with Lil’ Red.

Everything was for the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun knew that the Sword Sect couldn’t lose in this Ancient Barren Battlefield, no matter what.

“Let’s get familiar with the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, first.” Lin Yun closed his eyes and calmed his heart. When he circulated his Heavenly Dome Sword intent, the sky was torn apart and a mighty sword aura soared into the sky. In the next moment, Lin Yun was enveloped in sword rays and sunlight while hovering in the air. It looked like two suns were hanging in the sky.

As his sword ocean began to ignite, the purple diamond mark on his forehead became dazzling, giving him a devilish and transcendent temperament. The ground started to tremble violently when he walked. It was as though the earth had submitted to him.

This was a bizarre feeling that simultaneously felt unreal and real. Raising his head, the towering trees in the surroundings were under immense pressure from his gaze and they began to bend like they were bowing to him. At this moment, Lin Yun was like the King of the Sword, and nothing could withstand the pressure he was giving off.

This experience made Lin Yun’s eyes flicker, and he finally knew the meaning behind the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. The sky was the sword, and he was one with the sword. Firmament Sword Intent was to manifest his sword into the sky, but the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent took it one step further by him becoming one with the sword itself.

As his gaze fell onto the Flower Burial Sword not too far away, the sword began to tremble after sensing his gaze, and a mighty sword aura started to accumulate.

“Come!” Lin Yun waved his hand and the Flower Burial Sword flew over. Unlike in the past, the Flower Burial Sword didn’t fly into his hand but hovered in the sky like a star. Looking at the Flower Burial Sword, the term ‘Sword Manipulation’ appeared within his mind.
