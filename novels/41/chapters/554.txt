Chapter 555 - Bottom of the Well

After losing in spiritual runes, the white-clothed youth wanted to make a comeback with his cultivation, but he lost even more terribly. He was defeated by Lin Yun with just one punch. If he hadn’t worn his armor, he would probably be lying on the ground unable to get up.

Being humiliated, the white-clothed youth gnashed his teeth, “I admit that I lost. But don’t push it and ridicule the White Jade Academy’s reputation!”

“Did I?” Lin Yun laughed. “Didn’t you say those words yourself? Or did I hear incorrectly? Didn’t you call yourself a piece of trash and say that the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples are worse than dogs? What’s the matter? You were so arrogant when you bullied us, but now that you’ve lost, you’re not going to admit your words?”

Lin Yun’s words instantly made the white-clothed youth speechless. However, Lin Yun didn’t stop there, “You’re so weak, but seeing that your fellow disciples aren’t helping. Are they worse than trash like you or perhaps these people are dogs in the White Jade Academy?”

“What did you say?!”

“Brat, I dare you to say it again!” Lin Yun’s words instantly aroused public anger among the White Jade Academy’s party.

Lin Yun smiled, “You guys didn’t hear me clearly? Do you need me to repeat myself? It’s rather interesting to humiliate you people.”

The White Jade Academy’s party turned red from anger, but they didn’t dare to make a move when they recalled how the white-clothed youth lost. With that, Lin Yun had completely humiliated the White Jade Academy. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“What an arrogant tone. I never imagined that the Heavenly Province Academy would produce someone decent for once.” A figure descended from the sky right at his moment. He looked to be in his twenties, but the steadiness in his gaze was very mature. When he appeared, the White Jade Academy’s disciples all had joy on their faces.

“Junior Brother Cao, you’re finally here!”

“Teach this brat a lesson for us. He’s simply too arrogant!” The White Jade Academy’s disciples looked at the newcomer as if they had seen a knight in shining armor.

The newcomer turned to look at Lin Yun as though he wanted to see through Lin Yun with his gaze. He spoke out, “You’re that Flower Burial from the Great Qin Empire, right? I merely toured your academy for a brief moment and I’ve been hearing all about you.”

“That’s me,” replied Lin Yun. Lin Yun was also examining the newcomer. This youth had a powerful aura, but at the same time, it was veiled in a fog, so Lin Yun couldn’t see through his cultivation. However, he could sense that this youth’s attainment in spiritual runes was above him. Perhaps among the younger generation, only Mo Ling had a guaranteed chance of defeating this person. Interestingly, the temperament he was giving off was somewhat similar to Mu Xue.

“My name is Cao Xiu. Remember my name well!” Cao Xiu smiled as he flicked his finger. Spiritual runes began to gather around him as they combined into a mighty white tiger that roared as it pounced at Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun was shrouded by the shadow, he could feel his movements becoming stiff. The pressure had surprised Lin Yun. But just when Lin Yun was about to bring out his xiantian sword intent, the aura suddenly crumbled.

A petite figure appeared before Lin Yun and drew her sword as she split the ferocious tiger into two.

“Cao Xiu, your opponent is me,” said Mu Xue coldly.

Cao Xiu wasn’t surprised that Mu Xue would stand out as he smiled, “Mu Xue, I’m surprised that you rushed back from the Heavenly Sword Sect.”

“Hmph, Blackflame Sect’s Cao Xiu, didn’t you do the same?!” replied Mu Xue. Her words instantly shocked all the spectators. Both the Heavenly Sword Sect and the Blackflame Sect were overlord forces in the Ancient Southern Domain. They were existences that even the elders of other sects wouldn’t dare to provoke. The same went for the elders of the quasi-overlord forces.

Mu Xue and Cao Xiu represented two overlord forces. This was a shocking development for everyone.

“Let me see if you made any improvements over the years!” Cao Xiu’s eyes flashed as a terrifying aura was released from him that caused the sky to change. Everyone around him could feel the suffocating pressure.

Cao Xiu only looked to be twenty-years-old, but he was already a lesser Yang stage. However, Mu Xue reacted to it calmly as she also released her aura in the lesser Yang stage.

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by this. At the same time, he now knew why she looked at him with disdain back then, even after she suffered a little loss in his hands. So it turns out that she had also hidden her cultivation.

When the two clashed in the sky, the entire plaza began to tremble violently with a terrifying shockwave that sent many people flying. After their clash, they both retreated and looked at each other with a grave expression. They knew that there was no way they could determine a winner with a battle of this level.

“Let’s go!” Cao Xiu smiled as he left with the White Jade Academy’s disciples.

Mu Xue sheathed her sword as she looked at Cao Xiu’s silhouette with a grave expression. She then turned around to look at Lin Yun, “Lin Yun, now you know why I wanted you to give up your quota? Each academy only has one quota to invite outsiders for help. Liu Yunyan and I aren’t considered outsiders, so I hope that you can reconsider.”

“I’m sorry, but I’ve already made up my mind,” said Lin Yun as he turned around.

Mu Xue’s eyes flashed coldly. She had acknowledged Lin Yun’s strength based on his performance, which was why her tone was a lot softer. But she never expected that Lin Yun would still refuse her. She snapped, “Lin Yun, can’t you see? The protagonists of the Five Academies Competition have always been the overlord forces’ disciples. It doesn’t matter if you’re willing! You can’t change anything. Your strength doesn’t fit your attitude!”

I think highly of myself? Don’t you know that you’re a frog in a well? Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with rage. He wanted to explain, but he knew that she wouldn’t listen to him and that it would be pointless.

So what if you’re from an overlord force? Lin Yun sneered inwardly as he gave Mu Xue a side glance before he left. When Mu Xue saw Lin Yun’s gaze, she was stunned for some reason.

She was a genius among the Heavenly Sword Sect’s inner disciples and she would soon become a core disciple. No one dared to look at her with such a gaze. Even the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples looked up to her. Not even Mo Ling, whom she revered, would look at her with such a gaze.

No one had dared to look at her with such a disdainful and indifferent gaze. It never even happened in the Heavenly Sword Sect. Was it because she hurt his self-esteem? Not to mention the Great Qin Empire, but not even the Heavenly Province Academy could compare to the Heavenly Sword Sect. Lin Yun would understand the foundation of the overlord forces one day in the future.

Then again, she didn’t think Lin Yun would even have the opportunity to come in contact with it.

It doesn’t matter if you’re willing, but the Five Academies Competition is a stage only for disciples of the overlord forces. If you insist on going, then you’ll only be trampled upon. Mu Xue snorted inwardly as she left.

With her position in the Heavenly Sword Sect and Heavenly Province Academy, it was rare for her to admire someone, not to mention a guest deacon of the academy who came from the Great Qin Empire. After all, a frog in the well would have no idea about the vastness of the world.
