Chapter 736 - Chasing Not Immortality But Dream

Lin Yun and Drifting Goblet sat with a jar of Monkey Wine between them while they casually chatted.

“Drifting Goblet, what’s your relationship with Ziyao?” This question had bothered Lin Yun for a long time as Drifting Goblet seemed to know everything about Su Ziyao.

Back in the Great Qin Empire, Drifting Goblet was the one who gave the Dragon-Tiger Fist to him without any concern for the sect. In the past, Drifting Goblet had acted so carefree like when he gave up on the Dragon Gate Competition, showing no interest in it. Furthermore, he also seemed to have a mysterious identity. Otherwise, Su Ziyao wouldn’t let him get near her.

Drifting Goblet smiled bitterly and took a swig of wine before he sighed, “Where should I start? Su Ziyao might have been born in the Great Qin Empire, but her cultivation comes from the Profound Imperial Palace. The Profound Imperial Palace isn’t in the Ancient Southern Domain, but it’s from the world that I come from.”

Lin Yun was surprised, but it wasn’t unexpected. He knew that the Profound Imperial Palace didn’t belong to this world, but he didn’t expect that the Drifting Goblet also wasn’t from this world.

“She caused a great commotion in my world when she was born. I was one of her admirers. But I’m more fortunate than the others because I got acquainted with her. But now that I think about it, I’m really not that fortunate after all.” Drifting Goblet smiled bitterly before he shook his head. “I didn’t become a monk when I came to the Great Qin Empire, I was a monk before I got here. In fact, I still remember when my ancestral grandfather nearly tore the monastery apart.”

“But even though I feel a certain way, I’ve chosen to give up. However, not everyone is like me. So you have to be prepared in the future.” Drifting Goblet winked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. According to what Drifting Goblet said, those things happened before Su Ziyao joined Azuresky Sect. So Drifting Goblet tried to woo Su Ziyao and failed. After that, he chose to give up, including his attachment with worldly affairs.

“What’s that world like?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s a very interesting world, a world where holy sons are seen everywhere and holy daughters are not any inferior to Su Ziyao. It’s a world full of monstrous geniuses. There are countless demons who become emperors, saints who pursue immortality, and true dragons who become saints. It’s a grand and massive world, filled with those who chase not immortality but a dream!” Drifting Goblet became serious when he said that.

Looking at Drifting Goblet, Lin Yun was briefly stunned because he wasn’t any inferior to Su Ziyao right now. Vaguely, halos of golden light could be seen gathering behind him like a painting. But the painting was rolled up, so Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how breathtaking it would be when it unfolded. Occasionally, he could see holy light sprinkling onto the painting.

This made Lin Yun frown as he recalled a similar painting back in the secret realm. But that painting was already unfolded, while Drifting Goblet’s painting still seemed incomplete. This left Lin Yun shocked, not only by the demeanor that Drifting Goblet was showing, but also of the world he spoke of.

Immortality meant having the time to accomplish any desire. But in that world, people chased after their dreams instead of immortality. Lin Yun couldn’t imagine what that world looked like.

“What did you see behind me?” asked Drifting Goblet.

“Boundless holy light shining on a painting. But the painting doesn’t seem to be complete,” said Lin Yun after he collected himself. He didn’t say that he had a feeling the painting would be breathtaking when it opened up.

“Everyone has a painting in their hearts. Mine is already done, but I can’t open it. Before I left home, I changed my name to Drifting Goblet. Drifting Death was the name of a sword and with it, I killed more demonic cultivators than you’ve seen. I killed good and bad people. But one day, the sword broke and I couldn’t open the painting anymore.” Drifting Goblet smiled, “You’ll also have a painting of yours one day when you step into that world. The new era is arriving and everyone has an opportunity.”

“A new era?” Su Ziyao said that to the elder from Northern Snow Manor and the elder seemed excited. Just what kind of era was it that made the elder so emotional? Generally speaking, it was hard for a swordsman to be too emotionally affected.

“That’s right. A new era that will engulf all worlds. No one will be able to avoid it. Boundless opportunities are open, which is why the Draconic Banquet is so important this time. You have to make it into the top ten or it’ll be hard for you to see her again,” said Drifting Goblet. But he didn’t reveal too much.

Lin Yun also didn’t ask too much about it. He had promised Drifting Goblet ten jars of Monkey Wine only to hear that a new era is arriving and the heavenly path will be open.

“Let’s stop talking about it. Don’t ask anymore because Su Ziyao didn’t want to tell you about it. After all, it has nothing to do with you if you can’t make it into the top ten.” Drifting Goblet smiled as he rubbed his head, “Who knows, perhaps I can consider returning to a normal life if that happens. Hehe.”

“Get lost.” Lin Yun smiled. He knew that Drifting Goblet was only joking. Drifting Goblet couldn’t open his painting because he was restricted by himself. Lin Yun had a feeling that it wasn’t because of Su Ziyao. He probably did something serious before he left home.

The difference between Drifting Goblet and Drifting Death might be a single word, but the difference in meaning was massive. Death meant disaster, slaughter, and pain. Meanwhile, goblet meant a cup used to contain wine.

Retracting his smile, Drifting Goblet said, “But I have to tell you seriously that there are many geniuses in that world. I’m only one of Su Ziyao’s admirers. If you’re not strong enough, your outcome will be terrible. Su Ziyao can’t possibly save you all the time, not to mention that she has to bear…”

Drifting Goblet realized that he went too far, so he quickly shut his mouth. But Lin Yun didn’t seem surprised.

“I can already guess that her road isn’t easy.” Lin Yun drank a mouthful of wine with determination in his eyes, “But one day, I’ll catch up to her with the sword in my hand. I’ll cut off anyone who dares to touch her and I’ll bear what she bears.”

Was that an oath? At this moment, Drifting Goblet finally knew why Su Ziyao fell for Lin Yun. The geniuses in that world weren't the same as the seven geniuses of Skymound City. However, he believed in Lin Yun. If he couldn’t open his painting in his lifetime again to protect that girl, it was enough if this man’s sword could protect her.

“Let’s drink!” Drifting Goblet laughed and bumped cups with Lin Yun.

The two of them drank till sunset. When Lin Yun woke up, he was all alone. Drifting Goblet had left and he didn’t know when they would meet again.

Collecting himself, he found the Falling Aquatic Empyrean and asked about Lil’ Red’s current state. The Falling Aquatic Empyrean didn’t seem to like Lin Yun, but he still helped him. He searched through many records before he was certain that Lil’ Red wasn’t dead. It was merely in a rather peculiar state.

“Carry the Yin and embrace the Yang?” Lin Yun muttered. Logically speaking, Lil’ Red should be dead. But the dragon bloodline in its body had reached a limit and showed signs of evolution, so turning into a cocoon was a process it had to go through. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“But it shouldn’t be possible with its mutated bloodline. I’m curious what’s going on with it. Why don’t you leave it with me?” Falling Aquatic Empyrean asked as he was also curious because this state was rare.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he refused the Falling Aquatic Empyrean.

Falling Aquatic Empyrean smiled, “You should leave. There will be an opportunity in the Skymound Mountain Range and you might suffer in the Draconic Banquet if you miss it.”

In the end, Lin Yun had to leave. How little did the Falling Aquatic Empyrean care for him that he would use such a poor excuse? But would there really be an opportunity in the Skymound Mountain Range? The mountain range belonged to the Sword Sect, so events really did occur occasionally.
