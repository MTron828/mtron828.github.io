Chapter 1428 - Utter Defeat (1)

Xiahou Yan rolled on the ground after he was sent flying away by Lin Yun’s slap. After rolling across the ground, he landed where he had plunged his sword earlier. With swollen cheeks, he looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.

“Dual sword souls!” Xiahou Yan was shocked as he looked at Lin Yun. Everyone on the stage was stumped, and even the elders were shocked. Dual sword souls were extremely rare, and they now knew why Xiahou Yan was suppressed even after using his Innate Sword Physique and Innate Sword Heart.

“Chen Bing, Huang Yancheng, how long will you guys watch for?” Xiahou Yan yelled as he coldly glanced at the two.

But this changed Chen Bing and Huang Yancheng’s faces because Xiahou Yan was insane to try and drag them down. Although they were also unhappy, they maintained their rationale and knew not to disrespect the saints.

Xiahou Yan had utterly lost it, taking the opportunity that no one who was higher in cultivation than him would make a move against him, especially after knowing that Lin Yun had become the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint. This made his heart even more distorted, and he lost his rationale. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Hmph, do you think he’ll let you guys go in the future if you don’t step on him right now? Think about what you guys have done at the Barren Sword Mound!” Xiahou Yan swept his gaze at Huang Yancheng and continued, “Especially you, Huang Yancheng!”

“Trying to find helpers? Didn’t you say you’ll sweep through all the saints’ disciples in the Sword Sect by yourself?” Lin Yun said as he stepped forth. This made everyone in the surroundings look at Xiahou Yan with contempt.

Xiahou Yan was arrogant earlier, putting himself on the same level as the Sword Emperor. But he had practically used all of his trump cards, aside from summoning his constellation, and he couldn’t do a thing to Lin Yun. If he summoned his constellation and was defeated by Lin Yun, Xiahou Yan would become the biggest joke in the Ancient Barren Domain.

So Xiahou Yan had panicked. He had too much to lose, and he gradually regained his rationale when he became nervous. After thinking about how he humiliated the saints earlier, he couldn’t help but panic. This was why he wanted to drag Chen Bing and Huang Yancheng down with him.

“That guy is shameless. Lin Yun won’t bother with him, right?” Ye Ziyun said with contempt in her eyes. Ye Qing and others also had mockery in their eyes after seeing how disgusting Xiahou Yan was. Then again, they were also shocked by Lin Yun’s strength.

Xiahou Yan’s face changed as he reached for his sword and pulled it of the ground. After pulling his sword, he took several steps back to distance himself from Lin Yun. As his eyes flickered, Xiahou Yan swiftly calmed down and snickered, “The Radiant Sword Saint is one of the three sword saints in the Eastern Desolation. As his disciple, don’t tell me you don’t dare to fight the three of us? Didn’t you say that the Sword Sect cannot be humiliated? Didn’t you say that the Radiant Sword Saint cannot be humiliated? It looks like there’s nothing impressive about you after all.”

Everyone was left speechless because they never expected that Xiahou Yan would say something so shameless. Chen Bing and Huang Yancheng also exchanged glances before they fell into deep thoughts. What Xiahou Yan said did make sense. If they didn’t step on Lin Yun today, they would definitely suffer if they ran into him in the future.

The reason was simple. This was because, if they were in Lin Yun’s position, they didn’t think they would let them go so easily. Thus, a decisive light flashed across Huang Yancheng’s pupils as he said, “I have no intention to disrespect the Sword Sect, but I’m unconvinced as to why these people can become the saints’ disciples. So I’m only standing out to demand an explanation!”

“I’m also unconvinced and demand an explanation from the Sword Sect!” Chen Bing also spoke out.

“Since you guys aren’t convinced, you guys can come at me together.” Lin Yun said with a cold light flashing across his pupils. Since they wanted to join hands, why waste so much time talking? Lin Yun would just fulfill their wish.

Lin Yun’s words caused an uproar and everyone’s faces changed as they looked at Lin Yun. They were shocked by what he said. Lin Yun wanted to face Xiahou Yan, Chen Bing, and Huang Yancheng by himself? Chen Bing and Huang Yancheng weren’t weak, since their ranking on the Elysium Core Ranking wasn’t any lower than Xiahou Yan's.

The three of them together weren’t the same as the seven Saint Clans’ princes previously joining hands. This was a completely different concept.

“Lin Yun…” Jue Chen also furrowed his brows and wanted to stop Lin Yun.

“It’s fine. They’re right, and we have to convince them. I’ll fight, representing the Sword Sect and Radiant Sword Saint today!” Lin Yun indifferently replied.

“Hahaha! Don’t regret it, Lin Yun!” Xiahou Yan laughed and charged with his sword, not giving Lin Yun the chance to back down from his words.

When Xiahou Yan drew his sword, his firmament sword intent soared to the sky. As a swordsman, it was entirely different when he had a sword in his hand, and Xiahou Yan’s sword aura was ten times stronger than before.

“Brother Lin, sorry about this!” Chen Bing and Huang Yancheng also charged after recovering from their shock. When they drew their swords, their sword intents were at the pinnacle of sky sword intent. But that wasn’t all, Huang Yancheng was enveloped in flames, while Chen Bing had lightning flickering on the surface of his body.

Since they could make it to the Elysium Core Ranking, they were naturally strong. They were stuck in the sky sword intent for a long time, so they could only strengthen their sword intents by integrating them with other martial intents. This would barely bring their sword intents to the same level as the firmament sword intent.

When their three sword auras overlapped, they formed into a powerful pressure that made the faces of everyone in the surroundings change. But Lin Yun merely took a deep breath and slowly stepped forth, allowing their sword auras to envelop him.

When he took three steps out, his aura abruptly exploded with dazzling light emitting from his pores. At this instance, he had broken through his bottleneck and reached the Greater Elysium Core Realm.

After reaching the Greater Elysium Core Realm, the astral energy in Lin Yun’s violet palace expanded once more, growing from three thousand meters to ten thousand meters. Even his elysium core with the Golden Crow Saint Rune engraved on it began to grow until it reached the size of an adult human’s fist.

The breakthrough filled Lin Yun’s body with boundless energy. His cultivation had already reached the bottleneck, and everything had gone just as he had planned. He used Xiahou Yan, Chen Bing, and Huang Yancheng’s sword auras to help him break through the shackles and reach the Greater Elysium Core Realm.

Lin Yun waved his hand with a smile and summoned the Flower Burial Sword. When he grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword, a sword vibration rang out, and Lin Yun’s voice resounded, “Thank you for helping me make a breakthrough!”

With the Flower Burial Sword in his hand, Lin Yun’s firmament sword intent started to climb. But that was far from over. Consecutive dragon roars were echoing from within his body. A terrifying azure dragon aura was being emitted from his body and fused with his firmament sword intent.

An unbelievable scene occurred as Lin Yun’s sword aura surpassed Xiahou Yan, Chen Bing, and Huang Yancheng’s combined sword auras. When his sword aura clashed with them, Huang Yancheng gritted his teeth, “That guy used us to help him make a breakthrough!”
