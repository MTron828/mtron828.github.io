Chapter 1301 - Immortal From The Moon

Lin Yun’s strong stance had exceeded everyone’s expectations, catching the three transcendent geniuses by surprise. With a cold gaze, Lin Yun waved his hand and the Flower Burial Sword flew from his sword box. “You guys aren’t coming? Then I’m coming to you!”

Sensing Lin Yun’s killing aura, the Flower Burial Sword vibrated with a cold light flickering on its edges when it was drawn out. So what if they were taking advantage of his low cultivation? He would just kill them! Under the night sky, Lin Yun was enveloped in the silver moonlight as he charged at the three transcendent geniuses.

“You courting death!” The three transcendent geniuses said after a brief stun when they saw Lin Yun charging over.

“What arrogance…” Fang Muyang snickered. Being able to face Xia Yunzhen didn’t mean that he could face all three of them. Did he really think that they were weak? But very quickly, they couldn’t smile anymore. They could clearly see Lin Yun, but as he approached them, their senses gradually began to blur as his sword aura spread out.

“He disappeared?” The faces of Fang Muyang, Ye Xun, and Xia Yunzhen changed. They, then, brought out their constellations.

When a sword vibration resounded, silver and golden light suddenly appeared behind Fang Muyang. Fang Muyang couldn’t think much and retaliated by instinct. But when his fan collided with Lin Yun’s sword, he could feel his palm going numb.

“Damn it, what the hell is this strength?!” Fang Muyang was surprised because the other party was actually able to bear the pressure coming from the three’s constellations. When they fought, he knew that his opponent was clearly at the Galaxy Stage, and yet he couldn’t bring out his full Elysium Core Realm strength. This was bizarre.

When Lin Yun retreated, one golden Demonic Astral Flower after another flew from his body. When forty-seven Demonic Astral Flowers formed into an ocean of flowers, they brought a great boost to Lin Yun’s cultivation, and his astral energy wasn’t any weaker than the three of them at this moment. Combined with the Azure Dragon Saint Art, he was even stronger than the three of them.

Standing within the sea of flowers, Lin Yun turned around and thust his sword forth, unleashing a dazzling sword ray from the sword tip before it was followed by a boundless sword aura that exploded forth.

The face of Xia Yunzhen, who was launching a sneak attack from behind Lin Yun changed when a light shone from Lin Yun’s sword tip, and he quickly retreated.

But a golden light exploded from Lin Yun before he flew out like a golden crow, unleashing a sword ray from the sky, and faced Ye Xun’s blade head-on, easily erasing Ye Xun’s attack that he had been accumulating for a long time. This scene made Ye Xun’s heart tremble. He had never seen such a boundless sword aura before amongst those of the same generation. “H-How is this possible?!”

Raising his blade before him, Ye Xun’s blade aura manifested into a stone tablet, causing Ye Xun to grit his teeth as he tried to take this attack head-on.

“Can you even block my attack?” Lin Yun snorted. When he breathed, he unleashed a rain of sword rays at the stone tablet. Facing his attacks, Ye Xun was having difficulty defending, and each blow would send him flying back.

After forty-seven sword thrusts, Lin Yun’s sword was comparable to an azure dragon surging forth with the weight of a massive mountain range. When Ye Xun’s stone tablet broke apart, he threw out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying back.

As Lin Yun’s silver hair fluttered in the wind, he shook his wrist and thrust his sword back, unleashing a silver waterfall.

“N-N-NO!” Xia Yunzhen who was trying to launch a sneak attack nearly threw out a mouthful of blood because all of his moves were being calculated by Lin Yun. Before he could even unleash his attack, Lin Yun’s sword would always find his flaws and stab at the openings.

But this time, Lin Yun didn’t give him the chance to retreat. As a pair of golden wings unfolded behind him, the wings flapped and golden light dissipated across a hundred miles. The explosive power from the flapping wings made Lin Yun disappear from where he stood. When he reappeared once more, he was already standing before Xia Yunxzhen.

Xia Yunzhen squinted his eyes and pushed his lightning and flame intents to the limit. The talisman was like a bright sun rising before his chest. But Lin Yun’s sword technique was unrivaled. He had brought the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords to the manifestation stage, and his sword was like a meteorite that exploded in the air.

So the talisman that was like a bright sun fell before it could properly rise. When Lin Yun flew from the broken sun, it looked as easy as passing through a waterfall with his sword aimed at Xia Yunzhen’s chest.

Taking the attack head-on, Xia Yunxzhen threw out a mouthful of blood. When his clothes ripped apart, the saint armor that he was wearing underneath was revealed. But he was constantly being pushed back by Lin Yun’s sword, and fine cracks also started to appear on the saint armor.

This pushed Xia Yunzhen to a corner and he let out a ferocious roar with a ruthless light flashing in his pupils. As a transcendent genius, he was definitely a decisive person and unleashed his ferocious side, rather than cower in fear after being pushed into a corner.

“Die!” Xia Yunzhen charged forth, taking the risk of his saint armor being stabbed to pieces to gather all his astral energy on his right hand. After the lightning and flames gathered onto two golden runes on his arm, he threw an attack towards Lin Yun’s face.

But facing Xia Yunzhen’s retaliation, Lin Yun only flipped the sword in his hand and cut Xia Yunzhen’s arm off.

“NO!” Xia Yunzhen screamed as his blood splashed across Lin Yun’s mask. But Lin Yun didn’t let Xia Yunzhen go so easily and he swung his sword even more, tearing Xia Yunzhen’s saint armor apart before Xia Yunzhen threw out blood and fell from the sky like a damaged kite.

After he defeated Xia Yunzhen, Lin Yun didn’t chase after him, but disappeared with a flap of his wings, soaring into the sky like a golden crow. His sudden disappearance made Fang Muyang and Ye Xun’s attacks miss. When they raised their heads, they were so dazzled by the light that they couldn’t open their eyes.

Right at that moment, Lin Yun was shining with golden light so bright that he was like a bright sun. Before Ye Xun and Fang Muyang could respond, Lin Yun was already diving down from the heavens, unleashing a sword ray that landed on the two of them. Although they tried their best to defend, their means were easily destroyed before the sword ray and their blood splashed around.

“H-How is this possible?!” The two were shocked. They couldn’t imagine how strong Lin Yun’s attack had to be for the two of them to be unable to defend against it, even when they joined forces. At this moment, they were both left dumbfounded by Lin Yun’s invincible sword intent, striking a deep blow to their hearts.

After all, Lin Yun was all by himself, so it made no sense for him to be this powerful, even if he was strong. Combined with what happened to Xia Yunzhen, who had lost an arm, the strength revealed by Lin Yun made their scalps go numb.

“All lives beneath the fleeting clouds are mere ants, and only the sword is invincible out of the three thousand martial paths!” While the two were shocked, thirteen azure birds flew out from his body and merged to form a purple long sword. Under the sword ray, the rocks on the ground, buildings, metals, and grass were reduced to ashes.

The gigantic sword was like the king of all swords, and all the swords within a few myriad miles flew over when it released a sword vibration. When the few myriad swords hovered in the sky, they swiftly lost their luster, becoming rusty after being absorbed by the gigantic sword.

Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords—Myriad Sword Condensation!

Wielding the Flower Burial Sword with his right hand, Lin Yun’s left hand was placed on the sword. As a boundless sword aura swept out, Ye Xun and Fang Muyang were trembling under Lin Yun’s gaze. When they fell to the ground onto their knees, they both had pain written on their faces.

The sword aura that Lin Yun was releasing was too terrifying. As the holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, it had unleashed an unrivaled, domineering aura. His silver hair fluttered under the moonlight, which made him look like an immortal who came from moonlight.

“Stop!” The Greater Elysium Core Realm experts of the three sects finally couldn’t continue to watch. They didn’t expect that the three transcendent geniuses of their sects couldn’t take down that mysterious masked youth. So they began to panic and charged over.

But Lin Yun finally swung his sword down without any hesitation. At this moment, Lin Yun looked like an immortal from the moon with his sword ray radiating brightly.
