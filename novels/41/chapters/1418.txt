Chapter 1419 - Lin Yun's Sword Dao

When Lin Yun charged in the direction of the ninth-grade Spiritual Sword Beads, Xiahou Yan’s party also moved.

Xiahou Yan was the first to make a move. When he unleashed his aura, it far surpassed Jiang Cheng and Ye Ziyun, with his sword intent blazing like flames on him. His eyes also turned golden and emitted a dazzling light as a terrifying aura swept out of him.

“Firmament sword intent!”

Jiang Cheng and Ye Ziyun were both surprised. Was Xiahou Yan finally going to take out his trump card and fight seriously?

Earlier, when they ganged up on the Indigo Dragon Serpent, everyone could tell that no one had used their trump cards yet. After all, they were geniuses on the Elysium Core Realm. They all knew that they would have to pay a great price to kill the Indigo Dragon Serpent and would pay an even greater price if they were careless.

The Indigo Dragon Serpent might seem to be in a pathetic state, but it didn’t suffer any injuries. Xiahou Yan turned into a golden light and streaked across the distance between him and the Indigo Dragon Serpent. When he stabbed the Indigo Dragon Serpent, the scales of the Indigo Dragon Serpent began to drop.

As blood splashed, the Indigo Dragon Serpent began to sway. It flew into a rage as it glared at Xiahou Yan and roared, “You bastard! You dare to hurt this dragon?!”

“You’re nothing but a small snake…” Xiahou Yan snickered and retreated.

“You’re courting death!” The Indigo Dragon Serpent flew into a rage, turning into a purple shadow that charged forth. Simultaneously, the two chains in its hands blazed with venomous flames and were swung at Xiahou Yan.

But Xiahou Yan snickered as the sword in his hand glowed and easily knocked the chains back. The impact against the chains caused shockwave ripples to spread out.

“Let’s go!” The four brothers of the Huang Clan and Chen Bing charged over without hesitation.

“Summon your constellations!” Huang Yancheng roared. Soon after, multiple scrolls unraveled behind them as they fully unleashed their Heavenly Elysium Core Realm aura without any reservations. Their attacks left the Indigo Dragon Serpent in a pathetic state, and it had no choice but to frantically retaliate.

“What’s going on?” Ye Ziyun was in doubt, but wasn’t in a hurry to catch up to them.

“Something’s wrong…” Ye Qing replied. “All of them have the attention of the Indigo Dragon Serpent. Have they thought it through now that they’re fighting so seriously?”

“At least it’s better than before.” Jiang Cheng’s voice resounded. But just when he was about to bring out his full strength to kill the Indigo Dragon Serpent, he was stopped by the third brother of the Huang Clan.

“What are you trying to do?” Jiang Cheng coldly looked at Huang Clan’s third brother, Huang Kui. He didn’t place Huang Kui in his eyes at all. He wouldn’t bat his eye even if the four brothers ganged up on him.

“Hehe.” Huang Kui smiled. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Everything swiftly happened in a split second, and Lin Yun obtained two ninth-grade Spiritual Sword Beads.

At that moment, Xiahou Yan’s group suddenly spread out after pulling the Indigo Dragon Serpent over. When the Indigo Dragon Serpent saw an opening, it didn’t hesitate to charge over. It was no longer as arrogant as before after seeing that these humans were so powerful.

It was fine if they fought one-on-one, but if they joined hands, it would be the one to die. So it naturally charged out of the encirclement when it saw an opening.

“Not good!” Ye Ziyun’s eyes flickered, and she figured out what Xiahou Yan was planning.

Coincidentally, the direction that the Indigo Dragon Serpent charged into was in the direction of Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan. The two didn’t participate in the siege against the Indigo Dragon Serpent but were focused on gathering Spiritual Sword Beads. So they couldn’t react in time when they saw the Indigo Dragon Serpent charging over.

“Get lost!” The Indigo Dragon Serpent was touchy, especially after Xiahou Yan’s firmament sword intent managed to leave wounds on its body, causing blood to flow. Although the others failed to break through its scales, it was still in pain after taking their attacks.

Under this condition, it would be disastrous to anyone who was before it, not to mention that there was no time to react, especially with the massive difference in their strengths. So even if one was talented, fighting the Indigo Dragon Serpent would be hard.

As for Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan, there was nothing to say about them. They were only at the Lesser Elysium Core Realm. They might be able to deal with ordinary geniuses at the Greater Elysium Core Realm, but facing an opponent at the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm was different.

When the Indigo Dragon Serpent let out a breath, demonic light trapped Ye Ziling, Zhao Yan, and everyone else in that direction before it charged over. It didn’t place those people in its eyes and just quickly charged through.

But Lin Yun didn’t have many changes on his face when he saw this scene.

“Xiahou Yan, aren’t you a little too shameless?!” A cold light flashed across Jiang Cheng’s pupils because they had already agreed to join hands. But Xiahou Yan suddenly used such an underhanded tactic, so it wasn’t something he could accept.

“This scheme came from Huang Yancheng, and it has nothing to do with me. Plus, what has it got to do with you? You just have to watch how the famous Flower Burial deals with the Indigo Dragon Serpent.” Xiahou Yan replied.

Just when the two conversed, a pair of golden wings unfolded and emitted a dazzling, sun-like radiance . The wingspan reached seventy meters. When the wings appeared, it immediately overshadowed all the light, causing everyone to stop what they were doing and look in Lin Yun’s direction.

Everyone knew this was a scheme from Xiahou Yan’s party trying to make Lin Yun face the Indigo Dragon Serpent alone for them to benefit. To Xiahou Yan, this wasn’t only an opportunity for him to take revenge, but he could also take back the Bodhi Seed through this opportunity.

“That works?”

“Isn’t this a little too underhanded? Isn’t Xiahou Yan the strongest swordsman amongst the younger generation?”

“That bastard!” Gongsun Yan cursed out on the stage. He was anxious and worried about Zhao Yan. “That son of a bitch!”

This also drew everyone’s attention to Lin Yun, wanting to see how he would do. If he chose to save Zhao Yan and Ye Ziling, this practically meant that he would have to give up on the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead. Not to mention that he might also be eliminated from the test and couldn’t become a disciple of a saint.

But Gongsun Yan knew that Lin Yun would choose to save them based on his personality.

What happened after that also proved that Gongsun Yan was right. Lin Yun dove down like an arrow, instantly coming to where Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan were. When he unfolded his wings once more, a heatwave containing sword aura swept out. This instantly dispersed the venomous demonic aura, exposing the Indigo Dragon Serpent that was charging over.

“Get lost! Don’t stand in this dragon’s way!” The Indigo Dragon Serpent was in a terrible mood as sword rays shone from its pupils.

“Junior Brother Lin!” But before Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan could react, Lin Yun tapped his foot on the ground and dashed towards the Indigo Dragon Serpent, executing the Divine Solar Lunar Fist—Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron.

With a roar, a cauldron with dragon runes engraved on it flew out with Lin Yun’s punch. Lin Yun had used all three thousand eight hundred dragon runes in this attack, instantly sending the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron flying ten-odd meters out.

Lin Yun took three steps back as he waved his right hand. The Indigo Dragon Serpent’s scales were tough, and it was practically impossible for him to break them without using the firmament sword intent. Now that he looked at it, aside from the wounds caused by Xiahou Yan, the Indigo Dragon Serpent didn’t have any other injuries.

But even the firmament sword intent couldn’t break through the Indigo Dragon Serpent entirely and only left some cracks so that the scales could fall off. The scales were tightly packed without any gaps, so they had to remove the scales to injure it.

“Continue gathering Spiritual Sword Beads. You guys don’t have to care about me. I’ll have some fun with this little snake.” Lin Yun gave a smile to Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan.

“Why don’t we go? I don’t think we can compete over them.” Zhao Yan said after a brief pondering. They both knew their cultivation was too low and would be at a disadvantage if they fought with the other party. It wasn’t because they were afraid but because they felt bad being a burden to Lin Yun.

They couldn’t accept that they had to be saved by Lin Yun time and time again. Zhao Yan gritted his teeth with hatred for Xiahou Yan and the fact that he was too weak.

“Since when are you two so hypocritical?” Lin Yun smiled. “I have always followed a phrase, which is also my path as a swordsman, something I abide with.”

“What phrase?” Zhao Yan and Ye Ziling were stunned when they heard what Lin Yun said.

“As long as I don’t let others down today, others won’t let me down in the future. Since that’s the case, then why should I hesitate?” Lin Yun smiled.

When he was done, he didn’t wait for the two to reply and shoved them away. The Indigo Dragon Serpent was already charging over. It seemed to have targeted him.

Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan’s expressions became stiff as they pondered what Lin Yun said.

“Hey. Empress, are you awake? If you continue to sleep, I won’t call you again in the future.” Lin Yun transmitted his voice to Lil’ Purple in the sword box, waking her up.

“Why did you call me? I was having a good sleep!” Lil’ Purple rubbed her eyes.

“It’s for something fun.”

“Something fun?” Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit when she heard that.

Lin Yun smiled as he looked at the Indigo Dragon Serpent charging over, “Let Lil’ Red out in a while. Since these guys want to play, I will play with them, then!”

He also looked forward to seeing Lil' Red’s strength in the Dracoape form. Lil’ Red’s cultivation had reached the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm after refining the Devour Saint Rune and was wielding the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff. Since Xiahou Yan’s party wanted to play with him, he would play with them and see who could hold on till the end.
