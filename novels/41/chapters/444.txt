Chapter 445 - So-called Title?

A self-created technique? Lin Yun fell into deep thought because he didn’t recall a Thunderclap Crusher in the Thunderclap Sword technique. This meant that Bai Lixuan had created his own move.

Bai Lixuan’s Saint Physique is shocking enough, so how strong is he now that he had created a move himself? Bai Lixuan’s performance caused everyone to look at him with shock in their eyes.

“Ninth battle, the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Lin Yun VS the Sword Cloud Pavilion’s Twilight!” announced the princess. This caused the atmosphere that had just calmed down to become rowdy once more.

“Finally.”

“Twilight practically hates Lin Yun deep to his bones because Lin Yun killed his junior brother. I wonder if Lin Yun can survive this ordeal.”

“Lin Yun will certainly die unless he surrenders.”

“Interesting. Let’s see what he will choose. He shouldn’t have come to the competition, to begin with. He should be proud that he made it into the top thirty-two, so it won’t be embarrassing for him to surrender.” Everyone was filled with anticipation for the battle.

Two figures descended on the stage. They did not pay any attention to the surrounding discussion, but simply stared at each other. Twilight was donned in black and he looked at Lin Yun like he was looking at a prey. He didn’t even bother concealing the rage and killing intent in his eyes. “I told you three days ago that you better not run into me. If you’re tactful, you should surrender. Otherwise, no one can save you when the battle begins.”

“This fellow is trying to provoke junior brother on purpose!” Xin Yan instantly detected Twilight’s objective. The judge also looked at Lin Yun, waiting to see if he was going to surrender.

“No need,” said Lin Yun.

The judge no longer spoke and left the stage. Then, he made his announcement, “Begin!”

Twilight harrumphed coldly and unleashed a powerful aura from his body. He was like a sword that dazzled in the darkness like a star. As he began to release the sword intent from his body, his aura began to rise, which soon enveloped the entire stage.

“What power!”

“He’s planning to end this battle quickly without giving Lin Yun any chances.”

“How terrifying. I can’t imagine what kind of pressure Lin Yun is facing to stand before Twilight.”

“Twilight is truly worthy of his title…” Just by unleashing his aura, Twilight had displayed the terror of a titled figure to everyone.

When Twilight’s aura reached the pinnacle, he drew his sword and took a step forward. His sword ray was like a comet that streaked across the horizon. Paired with his terrifying sword aura, his attack was fast and ruthless.

Facing the attack, Lin Yun tightened his grip on the Flower Burial Sword. When he drew it out, the sound of the sword’s body rubbing against the sheath rang out like a ferocious roar. At the most critical moment, he blocked Twilight’s sword and their clash rocked the entire stage.

Lin Yun managed to block the attack, but what shocked everyone was the fact that Lin Yun didn’t even take a step back. When Twilight’s sword ray shattered, he frowned his brows. Then, he stabbed his sword out.

However, Lin Yun faced the attack calmly and activated the Seven Profound Steps. In the next second, he was like a golden crow dashing around the stage and every step of his was like a painting. However, Twilight was chasing Lin Yun closely and shattering all of Lin Yun’s afterimages.

In the blink of an eye, the two exchanged over ten moves. Twilight was like a mountain, who made use of his advantage in his cultivation to suppress Lin Yun.

“You’re strong. Even a Violet Palace Realm cultivator might not be able to gain an upper hand fighting you.” Lin Yun fell into deep thought because Twilight was truly terrifying. Twilight was stronger than Wu Mohan who Lin Yun fought previously. Although both of them were in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm, they weren’t on the same level.

“Glad you know. Now, die!” Twilight sneered and stomped his foot on the ground. His stomp instantly left cracks on the ancient stage. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Die? You must be dreaming,” replied Lin Yun with a blank face. The Iris Flower in his dantian bloomed and he finally unleashed his cultivation in the tenth stage.

“Tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm?!”

“How is this possible?!” Everyone was shocked by this scene. After all, Lin Yun was still in the ninth stage three days ago, but he was already in the tenth stage now. Furthermore, it didn’t look like he was in the initial tenth stage judging from his aura.

“Dual Moon!” Two moons appeared, one hung in the sky and the other was on the ground. The Flower Burial Sword in Lin Yun’s hand also emitted a radiating light as he swung his sword, shattering Twilight’s sword aura.

However, Lin Yun didn’t stop there as he spread his arms apart and dashed forward like a golden crow. Without any hesitation, he swung his sword down at Twilight’s head.

“You’re courting death!” Twilight was enraged that Lin Yun actually dared to come up to him.

“Luminous Starlight!” Twilight poured his origin energy into his sword, which made his sword seem like a dazzling star in the sky.

“Luminous Moon!” Lin Yun sneered and a moon appeared on his sword.

When the star and moon clashed, the turbulence of energy instantly devoured Lin Yun. The explosions from the clash rang out in everyone’s ears.

“Is he dead?” Everyone began to feel worried for Lin Yun, who was devoured by the violent energy.

Suddenly, a crisp crack sounded out. Shortly after, a ray of moonlight descended and swallowed up the entire stage. Within the moonlight, Lin Yun stood in the air holding onto the Flower Burial Sword. It was like the moon was descending to the earth. “A firefly dares to compete with the moon?”

Twilight’s gaze was full of shock. Then, he was sent flying.

“Is this a so-called title?” commented Lin Yun as he looked at Twilight who was sent flying.

“How arrogant!” yelled Twilight.

“Arrogant? So what?” Lin Yun raised his brow looking at the enraged Twilight. He pointed the Flower Burial Sword at Twilight. Before Twilight could react, a terrifying chill emitted from Lin Yun. The chill was so cold that it felt as if it could seal everything. It was naturally the Aquaselenic Sword’s Myriad Frost.

Twilight’s face changed when he sensed the terrifying sword aura devouring him. Without a second thought, he used his sword to defend himself. He started pouring his origin energy into the sword. Crisp shatters could be heard on the stage once again, but this time, icicles were falling onto the ground.

Twilight’s face turned pale as he was blown away once again. This time, he was throwing up blood. This made everyone shocked because Twilight was the one being injured. No one dared to believe what they saw. They even wondered if they were seeing it correctly. Is Lin Yun really not the one who was being injured?

“I have to admit that I underestimated you…” Twilight wiped the blood off his lips and a ray of light suddenly descended down from the heavens that enveloped him. Shortly after, two radiating sword rays formed a ‘十’ and Twilight emitted a dazzling brilliance. “But like I said, you’re going to die if you don’t surrender!”

When the ‘十’ was formed, Twilight took a step forward.

“That’s the Cross Seal! That means the Supreme Radiance Sutra reached the eighth stage!”

“Lin Yun is finished. The eighth stage of the Supreme Radiance Sutra is comparable to the Violet Palace Realm!” But before the clamor could settle down, an Iris Flower bloomed behind Lin Yun and he stabbed his sword forward.

Under Lin Yun’s attack, Twilight’s attack was completely crushed. When Twilight touched his forehead in disbelief, he was stunned because there was blood in his hand. In the next second, he was blown off the stage and his body was mutilated.

“From today onwards, there will be no Twilight among the eight titles,” declared Lin Yun as he swept his glance around.
