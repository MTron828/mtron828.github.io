Chapter 1305 - Breakthrough to the Astral Stage

Taking a deep breath at the summit of the mountain, it took a long time for Lin Yun to calm down before he said, “If I’m going to follow the Iris Constellation, then are there any flaws to it?”

“It’s not called the Iris Constellation because it’s created by the Iris Sword Saint. It was born at the beginning of the era before slowly shaping itself. It’s one of the Sovereign Constellations in ancient times, and it’s called the Heaven Subduing Constellation.” Lil’ Purple corrected.

“The Heaven Subduing Constellation…” Lin Yun muttered. The name was pretty overbearing.

“The constellation is actually made up of four paintings, the Coiling Dragon Abyss, Phoenix Parasol, Sun and Moon Radiance, and the Heavenly Sword. This means that you have to form four constellations, and each constellation is extraordinary. With it, you can easily suppress those so-called ‘transcendents’.” Lil’ Purple then said with a grave expression, “Then again, the risk is naturally high as well. It’s strong, but it’s also dangerous at the same time, and it’s even more dangerous than reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm.”

“I expected that,” replied Lin Yun calmly. Then again, dangers and opportunities coexisted at the same time. If he was satisfied with just being ordinary, then he wouldn’t have come to the Kunlun Realm.

“It’s not that easy,” replied Lil’ Purple. “Do you know what ‘sovereign’ means? It simply means invincibility. The moment you form a sovereign constellation, you’ll be participating in a battle amongst sovereigns, whether you like it or not. It will be a path filled with blood and corpses, and you’ll be making yourself out to be an enemy of the entire world.”

“Is that so?” Lin Yun muttered to himself.

“So you have to ask yourself: Do you have what it takes and the determination to become a sovereign? If you don’t, then I don’t suggest you form a sovereign constellation because you’ll be bound to fail,” said Lil’ Purple with a grave expression. Sovereign didn’t mean a realm but an existence.

Hearing that, Lin Yun’s blood calmed down a little. His heart as a swordsman wouldn’t allow him to bow to anyone, but he knew that he was far from being invincible, and he had never really thought about it before. So Lil’ Purple’s words were like a bucket of water pouring down on him.

Along the way, aside from persevering his heart as a swordsman and those he cared about, he tended to follow the trend and wouldn’t think much. But now that he looked at it again, his path had been a brutal one along the way, and he had never stopped killing.

He then asked himself if he was willing to allow the sword in his hand to be lower than others. Would he be willing to bow to others? Would he be willing to live an ordinary life? Definitely not!

Thinking about it to this point, Lin Yun calmed down. He might seem to have been following the trend all along, but he had actually been walking on a path as a sovereign because his heart as a swordsman wouldn’t allow him to bow to anyone. Truth be told, his heart had already made a decision for him.

As he slowly opened his eyes, there was no joy or sorrow in them. When Lil’ Purple raised her head to look at him, she already knew his answer and waved her hand.

When Lin Yun waved his hand, countless Divine Astral Pellets flew out from his interspatial pouch. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun sat down and began to refine the astral energy in his body. At the same time, his bottleneck to the Astral Stage broke apart, and his aura began to surge violently. This also meant that Lin Yun officially had one foot into the Astral Stage.

He started with the first painting, the Coiling Dragon Abyss. As boundless astral energy poured into his body, it filled his body with unimaginable power. He had been waiting for this moment for a long time, but when this moment really came, he was surprisingly calm.

He had rid his mind of all thoughts and was fully submerged in creating his own constellation. Four hours later, a painting unfolded behind Lin Yun. The background of the painting was a boundless ocean with violent waves that even made space tremble. At the same time, the ocean was so huge that it looked like an abyss.

“That’s not right. Not right.” Lil’ Purple shook her head because Lin Yun didn’t fully grasp the intent of this painting. But she didn’t utter a single word because Lin Yun could only rely on himself for this.

As if Lin Yun had heard Lil’ Purple’s words, the painting broke apart. When Lil’ Purple saw this scene, she smiled, “Looks like I’m worried for nothing.”

Lin Yun had tried several times, failing several times in the process. But after several failures, a painting finally unfolded behind Lin Yun. The ocean in the painting was boundless and majestic. But when the painting fully unfolded, the ocean seemed small, and there was a dragon at the center of the painting. When the true dragon unleashed a roar, it had unleashed a terrifying dragon aura that caused waves to sweep out.

When the true dragon roared in the painting, it looked as though an apocalypse was about to arrive. At this moment, he had finally completed the first painting, the Coiling Dragon Abyss.

Next would be the Phoenix Parasol, and this scene made Lil’ Purple nod her head because Lin Yun’s progress wasn’t bad. Lin Yun’s comprehension was a lot stronger than others, and he didn’t follow completely because the true dragon was an Azure Dragon King.

While Lin Yun was creating his own constellation after reaching the Astral Stage, in a valley filled with flowers and herbs, Jiang Lichen, Feng Zhang, and Liu Qingyan were guarding outside the valley with grave expressions.

They were pretty lucky because they weren’t separated after entering the Profound Wither Island. When they were fighting for a saint elixir half a month later, they ran into Luo Hua and Ye Ziling. With Luo Hua and Ye Ziling joining hands, they easily defeated all the geniuses and obtained the saint elixir. After that, they were travelling together, and their luck wasn’t bad. The three of them have already reached the Elysium Core Realm.

“Senior Sister is really terrifying. She didn’t show it before, and she really gave us a surprise after entering the Profound Wither Island.”

“I heard that Senior Sister has the rare Divine Dragon Saint Physique. Regardless of aptitude or talent, she’s a lot stronger than that Sikong Zhou.”

“If she can refine an origin saint rune, she’ll probably be comparable to those transcendent geniuses.”

“Let’s hope that everything goes smoothly.” The three said with grave expressions as they looked around, not daring to be careless. The three of them received help from Ye Ziling and smoothly reached the Elysium Core Realm, so they naturally hoped that Ye Ziling could refine the origin saint rune.

Deep in the valley, Ye Ziling and Luo Hua were together before an ancient towering tree that was ten miles ahead of them. The three were enveloped in a mist, and the mist contained a terrifying lightning energy. The rune engraved on the surface of the tree was terrifying, and it was filled with a terrifying and dangerous aura.

This was a Heavenly Lightning Tree and it had an origin saint rune. Although it was still young, it was already strong enough.

“You sure that you don’t need an origin saint rune?” Ye Ziling asked. They were the ones who found this valley, and she could give it to Luo Hua if the latter wanted it.

“You have the Divine Dragon Saint Physique and the bloodline of the Snow Radiant Clan. So this Heavenly Lightning Saint Rune is suitable for you,” said Luo Hua. “Go ahead and refine it. I’ll keep watch for you.”

“Why help me?” Ye Ziling asked.

“If Lin Yun was the one refining the origin saint rune here, would you guard him?” Luo Hua asked. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“That’s for sure,” replied Ye Ziling.

“Then, that’s enough,” smiled Luo Hua.

Ye Ziling was briefly stunned before she smiled. “I have to admit that you’re different from my imagination. In the beginning, when I heard that you’re a descendant of a saint clan in the Ancient Barren Domain, I have to admit that I had some prejudice against you.”

This was because descendants of saint clans have been coming to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect for the Sword Saint Mountain. They didn’t have a sense of belonging to the Sword Sect, and even if they didn’t show it, she could sense that they considered themselves as nobler than others. Many times, they would even try to pester her, so she had a strong enmity against them.

But during this period together with Luo Hua, Ye Ziling noticed that there were many characteristics of Luo Hua that captured her. Although Luo Hua was a little cold, they got along pretty well. So Ye Ziling knew that Luo Hua definitely had a huge origin, she was strong and prideful, but she wasn’t arrogant.

If there was something bad about Luo Hua, it would probably be that she wasn’t a person of many words, and it was also rare for her to be interested in anything. It appeared that aside from Lin Yun, she wouldn’t pay attention to anyone else.

“I know. I’ve only come to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect for him, and the Sword Saint Mountain isn’t my main objective.” Luo Hua plucked a flower and played around with it. But because of the Ice Phoenix Bracelet she was wearing, it made the flower in her hand stand out even more.

“You knew him since long ago?” Ye Ziling asked. Seeing Luo Hua nodding her hand, she asked again, “Since that’s the case, then why are you wearing a veil? Don’t you want him to know who you are?”

This was something that Ye Ziling couldn’t figure out about Luo Hua. She didn’t know much about the relationship between men and women, and she took a long time to differentiate between Flower Burial and Lin Yun. She has feelings for Flower Burial, but Lin Yun was just a good friend of hers.

But she was smart, and she could tell that Lin Yun was very fond of Luo Hua. She could see the sparks and light in her eyes.

“He did some things that I’m not very happy with,” said Luo Hua coldly before she crushed the flower in her hand. When she opened her palm, the shattered petals drifted along the wind.

When Ye Ziling heard that, she inwardly smiled because she could roughly guess what Lin Yun had done. Based on Luo Hua’s personality, Lin Yun probably got involved with other women for her to be angry. But despite the fact that she was furious, she still protected Lin Yun in the dark, and this didn’t make her look as cold. Instead, it made her look pretty adorable.

Then again, she would only think about that inwardly and wouldn’t say that to Luo Hua. After a brief rest, Ye Ziling began to subdue the Heavenly Lightning Tree. This tree had a deep meaning to her because it would be hard to find something comparable outside the Profound Wither Island. Since she possessed the Divine Dragon Sword Physique and Snow Radiant Clan’s bloodline, she was in need of an origin saint rune.

The Heavenly Lightning Tree wasn’t easy to deal with, but she could feel at ease with Luo Hua standing guard for her. At the same time, the relationship between the two had also improved a lot.
