Chapter 2092 - Fight

The attack was too abrupt, and the saint dao enveloped within it made this attack terrifying. Even Lin Yun didn’t dare to take it head-on. He could defeat Quasi-Saints by not relying on his physique and cultivation but his attainment in sword dao.

If he took an attack from a Quasi-Saint head-on, especially a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase, he would definitely suffer heavy injuries. So he didn’t have time to think and could only stop treating Bai Xiao before stepping forth to dodge the incoming attack. But the other party had predicted this scene and pushed a palm towards Lin Yun’s chest.

Lin Yun let out a groan as he smashed against the wall. When the cloud of dust settled down, Lin Yun saw that the one who attacked him was a yellow-clothed man, and that sword from before came from the blood-clothed woman. Aside from them, there was a youth who was standing from far away, looking at him with a smile.

“To withstand an Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saint’s attack and still live. Your attainment in sword dao is terrifying, and normally I can’t bear killing you,” the youth smiled.

Yellowclothed Venerable smiled, “He’s strong. He used his sword intent to negate fifty percent of my attack, and he also has a cultivation technique that corrodes thirty percent of my saint aura. So he only suffered twenty percent of my attack. Even so, he must possess a saint physique and might be a golden generation genius of a holy land or clan.”

The blood-clothed woman was bewitching as she licked her lips and smiled, “A golden generation genius. It’s a pity for him to die here when the Golden Era is about to arrive.”

These three were strong, and have easily analyzed Lin Yun. Bloodclothed Venerable was a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase, not to mention she had a unique bloodline that bestowed her control over flames. Giving her a form of mysterious flames. Aside from that, her bloodline also granted her lightning-fast speed.

With a flash, Bloodclothed Venerable appeared behind Lin Yun, but Lin Yun was much faster with his Divine Sunchasing Art. With a slight ripple in the surrounding space, Lin Yun avoided Bloodclothed Venerable then appeared beside her.

“You’re still too lacking to compete with me with speed,” Lin Yun said coldly, reaching for her head.

This made Bloodclothed Venerable’s face change because she didn’t expect this guy to be faster than her with a cultivation at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. She quickly formed seals and a flaming flower enveloped in saint dao appeared behind her. When Lin Yun’s attack landed on it, he couldn’t even shake the flower.

“The Bloodfire Demon Flower?” Lin Yun was surprised upon recognizing this flower. He quickly changed his strategy and activated the two dragon saint physiques, pouring two hundred thousand dragon runes into his hand.

Bloodclothed Venerable was proud that this man’s attack couldn’t break through the defence of the Bloodfire Demon Flower, but Lin Yun’s subsequent attack slammed her into the ground.

“Dragon Clan’s saint physique?” The distant youth was surprised, before his expression finally became serious. This was because the dragon aura exploded from Lin Yun, finally making the youth take this person before him seriously.

As the ground exploded and Bloodclothed Venerable flew out, blood dripped down her lips as she smiled, “I’m envious of your saint physique.”

Before the ground exploded, Lin Yun retreated to the side with Bai Xiao. He was in an unfavorable situation now.

The woman’s physique was weird. Lin Yun’s attack merely caused her to suffer some light injuries, not to mention that the yellow-clothed man and the youth were just watching.

He began to wonder about the identity of the youth because the man and woman seemed to be his subordinates. Lin Yun knew that the Kunlun Realm was filled with crouching tigers and hidden dragons, so he wasn’t cocky to the point of thinking that he was invincible amongst the same generation by only relying on his cultivation at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. He would flee if necessary.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

As Lin Yun’s thoughts processed, he soon had an idea and pushed the Divine Sunchasing Art to the limits, filling his body with nirvana aura before flying forth.

“Hehe!” Bloodclothed Venerable smiled coquettishly before controlling nine crimson flames to surround Lin Yun, before the encirclement of the crimson flames gradually shrank. Very quickly, it formed into a tornado that trapped Lin Yun within. This was the attack that Bai Xiao had taken earlier.

Lin Yun naturally had a countermeasure for this situation as he unsheathed the Flower Burial Sword with thirteen figures flying out.

“Myriad Swords Unite!” Empowering his attack with Astral Sword Intent, this attack had reached a whole new level. If one looked from above, it could look like two rings were clashing together, with the outside ring shrinking and the inside ring expanding. There was a terrifying outburst of energy as the two rings came in contact. The sword rays and flames were creating multiple craters on the ground.

Bloodclothed Venerable took a few steps back before she regained her footing. She smiled, “As expected of a golden generation genius. Yellow, you stay out of this.”

Bloodclothed Venerable looked excited, planning to capture Lin Yun by herself. Yellowclothed Venerable merely smiled as he watched. He was confident in Bloodclothed Venerable’s strength but kept an eye on Lin Yun. This was because he was a little terrified that this guy was able to threaten the life of an Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saint with his cultivation at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

Such an opponent was troublesome to deal with, and it was no wonder that Bloodclothed Venerable looked so excited. While indigo saint aura gushed from Bloodclothed Venerable’s body, it formed into indigo flames that soared into the sky.

Very quickly, the crimson flames blazed into a cloud that soon spread to a ten-odd-mile radius, enveloping the area and locking onto Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he muttered, “This woman isn’t a Bloodfire Demon Flower who took on a human form, right?”

He saw a Bloodfire Demon Flower in the clouds, making him suspect that Bloodclothed Venerable was a Bloodfire Demon Flower that had cultivated into a human. Since demonic beasts could reach the Quasi-Saint Realm, flowers could naturally do it, not to mention it was the Bloodfire Demon Flower.

Flames and saint aura intertwined as Bloodclothed Venerable raised her hands before forming a violent tornado. Lin Yun didn’t dare to take this attack lightly and activated the two glory spirits within his sword, unleashing a sword ray that reached a few hundred feet, tearing the flaming tornado into two.

Right then, a hand tore apart the clouds. It was a hand enveloped in vines with a flower bud in the center of the palm, blazing with crimson flames, illuminating Lin Yun’s mask red.

When the Flower Burial Sword clashed with the vines, the massive power behind the attack numbed Lin Yun’s arm, and that attack sent him flying to the ground.

Bloodclothed Venerable returned to her human form and flew out from the clouds. She felt that her opponent must have been heavily injured and could no longer resist. “No movements?”

Bloodclothed Venerable lowered her head and frowned before she sighed, “He died just like that? I’ve yet to even use my full strength…”

“You’ve yet to use your full strength? I’ve yet to get started.” A voice suddenly came from behind Bloodclothed Venerable.

This made Bloodclothed Venerable’s face change. She didn’t turn around, but she could sense a murderous intent coming from behind her that nearly made her heart stop. She didn’t hesitate to spread her arms apart and dashed forth.

Quasi-Saints had an exceptional sense of danger, and she moved quickly without any hesitation. But Lin Yun’s sword was faster as a hundred afterimages overlapped with a sword ray flying out. Bloodclothed Venerable was strong, but how could she resist an attack from a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact empowered with the Astral Sword Intent? Thus, her entire arm was severed.

Lin Yun quickly caught up and coldly asked, “What’s your relationship with Wang Muyan?”

Lin Yun’s sword followed behind, and it would have pierced through her heart if Bloodclothed Venerable was slightly slower. The Bloodclothed Venerable didn’t dare to answer because she could sense that she would die if she was distracted.

“Stop!” Yellowclothed Venerable made his move since he had been keeping an eye on this mysterious person. He dashed over and used his hand to block Lin Yun’s attack, causing a metallic clash with sparks flying around. Yellowclothed Venerable’s palm felt as though it was made of metal. He then attacked Lin Yun.

Lin Yun felt he was facing a hundred opponents because there was a phenomenon behind Yellowclothed Venerable, looking like a Thousand-Armed Boddhavista. Each hand took a different form. There were punches, claws, and thrusts that enveloped Lin Yun, not to mention each attack was an attack from a Quasi-Saint, and this instantly placed him in a difficult position, and he could only retreat. But Lin Yun didn’t panic. Instead, he resolved Yellowclothed Venerable’s attack, not allowing him to accumulate his strength.

“Not bad. To block my Thousand-Armed Body, you’re not only a golden-generation genius, you must also be famous within the Eastern Desolation,” the Yellowclothed Venerable sneered, looking at Lin Yun.

As Lin Yun retreated, he said, “I heard that the Seven Venerables are those who failed the competition for the position of the Divine Son, with Whiteclothed Venerable being the strongest, possessing the Heavenly Aquatic Serpent’s bloodline. Second in line is Scarletclothed Venerable and Orangeclothed Venerable being higher than Yellowclothed Venerable and Bloodclothed Venerable.”

“Interesting. Since you know so much about my divine cult, it looks like I can’t allow you to live,” Yellowclothed Venerable smiled.

“You? I’m afraid you can’t do it.” Lin Yun shook his wrist, which changed his sword technique. A sea of flames spread out as golden radiance shone from him with a powerful sword aura soaring to the sky. This was one of the three ultimate attacks of the Divine Firefly Sword, the Flaming Golden Lotus.

This caught Yellowclothed Venerable by surprise and the Thousand-Armed Body was destroyed before Lin Yun’s sword thrust towards his chest. But the sword bent, being unable to penetrate the Yellowclothed Venerable’s body.
