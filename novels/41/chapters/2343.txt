Chapter 2344 - Swordsman’s Fangs

“W-What are you trying to do?” Gu Yuxin was frightened to see Lin Jiangxian making a move. She didn’t expect Lin Jiangxian to dare to make a move on the spot. But she was still a genius from a Divine Clan, and her response was swift, dodging the incoming attack.

“Heavenly Dragon Roar!” A cold light flashed within Lin Jiangxian’s eyes as she chased after Gu Yuxin. As a dragon’s roar echoed, the five dragons in her palms formed into five sword rays that flew out, shattering the saint energy around Gu Yuxin.

Everything happened too quickly and it was already fortunate for Gu Yuxin to avoid the first attack, not to mention the second. She threw out a mouthful of blood with her complexion becoming pale as she kneeled on the ground.

“H-How is this possible?!” Gu Yuxin was shocked, looking at Lin Jiangxian with fear.

“A genius will be a genius wherever you put him. Even if I’m not in the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s headquarters, I can easily crush someone like you. Get lost!” Lin Jiangxian roared and gave Gu Yuxin a slap, sending the latter flying away and rolling down the stairs. It didn’t take long before Gu Yuxin was covered in blood.

“Yay!” Ji Zixi cheered.

Gu Yuxin stopped after she landed before Lin Yun’s group. Seeing this, Xiong Tiannan smiled, “Bitch, didn’t you tell us to wait? So... we waited just to see you rolling down the stairs? I prefer the arrogant you from before.”

Gu Yuxin was in great pain, and she fainted from the anger after hearing what Xiong Tiannan said.

“Hahaha!” Xiong Tiannan showed no sympathy for Gu Yuxin. He wasn’t someone with a soft heart when seeing beauty.

Everyone else was dumbfounded when they saw this. After all, a genius of a Divine Clan was so quickly defeated by an unknown woman. The commotion that was created was great, regardless if it was the dragon’s roar or slap. Even many of the geniuses who were already climbing the stairs couldn’t help turning back to look.

When they saw that a Divine Clan’s disciple was in this state, Gu Jun and those from the Gu Clan became furious.

“Cripple her!”

“Where did this bitch come from?! How dare she bully someone of our Gu Clan!”

“Unforgivable! Someone with a lowly bloodline dares to provoke our Divine Clan?!”

Everyone became furious. Gu Yuxin might not have any position in an Ancient Divine Clan and would even be bullied by those from the direct lineage. However, she was still someone from a Divine Clan, and they wouldn’t allow their fellow clansman to be bullied by an outsider. This had touched their bottom line.

When Gu Jun turned around, he was stumped when he saw Lin Jiangxian. He frowned, “Lin Jiangxian, even though you’re chased out of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s headquarters, do you have to vent your anger out on Gu Yuxin? You’re at least a figure.”

The surroundings fell into silence because no one expected that Gu Jun was alarmed.

Lin Jiangxian smiled, “Your Divine Clan is still the same as before, putting yourselves in a high position and making yourself sound innocent. You’re really disgusting.”

Everyone was shocked when they heard that. After all, Gu Jun was someone ranked in the top hundredth on the Brandished Dragon Ranking, one of the strongest geniuses amongst the Gu Clan’s younger generation. Most importantly, he was still young and was only thirty. He still had more potential to uncover with endless possibilities in the future.

When all the gazes fell onto Lin Jiangxian, everyone was curious about the origin of this person.

“Who is that woman? She’s really cocky.”

“I don’t know...”

“She’s Lin Jiangxian, the chief disciple of the Azure Cloud Realm’s Heavenly Sword Pavilion. The Azure Cloud Realm isn’t big, so you probably don’t know about it.”

“The Azure Cloud Realm is too remote without an immortal holy land. Isn’t she asking to be humiliated by going against a Divine Clan?”

Under everyone's discussions, Gu Jun looked impatient, and indifferently said, “Cripple her. The Gu Clan doesn’t provoke others, but we’re not afraid of troubles, either.”

Gu Jun had no interest in Gu Yuxin, and he didn’t want to be troubled by this matter either, so he continued to climb the stairs.

The moment Gu Jun gave the order, a few people by his side dashed out.

“Big Sister Lin, let me help you!” Ji Zixi charged forth upon seeing this. She had formed a deep relationship with Lin Jiangxian along the way, so she naturally couldn’t hold back after seeing that Lin Jiangxian was being bullied.

“I’ll go have some fun as well,” Xiong Tiannan grinned. He had been wanting to find an opportunity to display himself after refining the Golden Dao Fruit, and this was an opportunity. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Lin Yun smiled as he calmly climbed the stairs.

Very quickly, Ji Zixi and Xiong Tiannan fought with the geniuses of the Gu Clan. They exhibited great strength from the start, holding their ground against the Gu Clan’s geniuses. That was especially the case for Ji Zixi, who was violent when she made a move despite her innocent appearance. She swiftly gained the upper hand against three opponents with a phoenix cry echoing from her that made her look like a fairy.

“Heavenly Phoenix Cry!”

“Sky Incineration Flames!”

“Great Solar Palm!”

Ji Zixi pushed out four palms with flames forming into a bright sun that looked like the hand of a golden phoenix. The three geniuses from the Gu Clan were heavily injured from her attacks and they rolled down the stairs.

As for Xiong Tiannan, he was pretty straightforward, raising his cauldron and swinging it around. The cauldron was like a brick, and two of the Gu Clan’s geniuses were covered in blood. He grinned, “It looks like I have to be more elegant in my fight in the future.”

Many people’s faces changed when they saw the outcome of the fight.

“Who is she? She’s gorgeous.”

“They’re not from the Divine Clan, but they’re actually so strong.”

“I heard that she came from the Kunlun Realm like Flower Burial, the one who defeated the divine disciple.” Ji Zixi attracted more attention.

But the strength displayed by Ji Zixi was shocking, leaving the Gu Clan’s geniuses dumbfounded. Most importantly, she didn’t look like she was from a barbaric realm, judging from her temperament.

“She’s really strong, but the Gu Clan is a Divine Clan. Their foundation is different from other cultivators.” Someone sighed with pity.

“You guys are getting on my nerves!” Gu Jun said with a pale face, “Gu Tian, you go and deal with them.”

When he said that, a palm descended from the sky. This was a high-grade dragon spirit martial technique, the Primordial Astral Art. Gu Tian had brought this to greater mastery, and he could be ranked in the top ten within the Gu Clan.

But before the palm descended, flames soared to the sky with an aura belonging to a seventh-stage Saint Lord. This made the faces of everyone nearby change and become grave. There might be many experts here, but there weren’t many at the seventh-stage Saint Lord. But Gu Jun could easily command a genius like that, and anyone could see how terrifying the Divine Clan’s foundation was just from this.

When the palm descended, starlight formed and a vast starry sky appeared that made Xiong Tiannan feel tremendous pressure, making him take a few steps back.

“Seventh-stage Saint Lord?” Xiong Tiannan frowned. Just when he was hesitating if he should make a move, Ji Zixi’s voice resounded.

“Big Sister Lin, let me deal with him!” Ji Zixi smiled as she charged forth.

“What impudence...” Gu Tian sneered as the starry sky behind him revolved with stars flying out.

Ji Zixi pushed her hands forth with a golden radiance that shot out. When the starry sky clashed with the golden radiance, the shockwave caught Xiong Tiannan by surprise and took a few steps back. In the critical moment, a hand fell onto his shoulder to help him regain his footing.

It was Lin Yun, who had slowly come over. Xiong Tiannan thanked Lin Yun before he exclaimed in shock, “She’s that strong?”

He couldn’t believe it since Ji Zixi had been obediently following Lin Yun, and he only thought that Lin Yun was lucky to find a beauty like her. But he was shocked when he witnessed Ji Zixi’s strength.

“She has always been this strong,” Lin Yun smiled. After all, Ji Zixi was the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, and she hadn’t been slacking since coming to the Heavenly Barren Realm.

As she fought with Gu Tian, the latter couldn’t unleash the advantage in his cultivation, making him furious upon sensing the doubtful gazes from the surroundings. When the primordial aura in his violet palace fused with his saint energy, his aura alone forced Ji Zixi to take a few steps back.

“Hmph!” Gu Tian’s eyes flashed with a cold light as he charged forth, wanting to suppress Ji Zixi. But in the critical moment, Lin Jiangxian appeared before Ji Zixi.

“You think that you’re a genius? You’re merely a frog in a well!” Gu Tian sneered as he unleashed his attack. But his attack was easily caught by Lin Jiangxian, and this naturally left Gu Tian shocked. He exclaimed, “H-How is this possible?!”

“Who isn’t a seventh-stage Saint Lord?” Lin Jiangxian smiled as she pushed forth, releasing her primordial aura with a golden radiance shining in her eyes, releasing the Divine Light Sword Intent and made Gu Tian throw out a mouthful of blood as he was sent flying away, crashing onto several people.

“Seventh-stage Saint Lord? H-How is this possible...” Gu Yuxin was dumbfounded when she saw this scene. She turned to look at Lin Yun, this azure-robed swordsman that didn’t look anxious about offending a Divine Clan. She instantly wondered if she had offended someone she shouldn’t.

This immediately made Gu Yuxin feel fearful. When she saw Lin Yun turning back, her face became pale with her hands trembling.
