Chapter 988 - Undercurrent

Mu Xiuhan, Chen Hao, and Zhao Qi died from Lin Yun’s sword. Including Feng Xuanyi, four of the seven heads were killed by Lin Yun. It was an achievement that no one could believe.

It was even more unbelievable that Lin Yun was from a lower realm. This fact only made his achievements even more impressive.

Suddenly, a black bolt of lightning streaked across the horizon and took the three interspatial pouches.

A brief moment later, the crowd was able to see that the black light was Lin Yun’s pet. It was the same black cat that wielded the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff and injured Feng Xuanyi. When they saw how fast Lil’ Red moved, they were certain that Lil’ Red took interspatial pouches pretty often.

Everyone was jealous of Lil’ Red because they knew that the seven heads had many treasures. However, no one dared to move when they remembered Lin Yun’s sword.

Lin Yun finally landed on the stage where his sword box was laying and all eyes were on him. The crowd no longer treated him as an ant, but they looked at him with respect. With his sky sword intent, Lin Yun was destined to shine brightly in the Heavenly Path.

Lin Yun’s expression didn’t change as his sky sword intent dissipated. He had revealed all of his trump cards by bringing out the sky sword intent, so he knew that it would be impossible for him to catch anyone off guard in the future. It didn’t bother him though. He knew that it would be revealed sooner or later.

Now that he had revealed his full strength, everyone had to think long and hard if they wanted to make a move against him. Then, Lin Yun looked at Yu Haotian, which caused the surrounding atmosphere to become intense.

Everyone knew that Lin Yun and Yu Haotian had a feud despite being from the same realm. After all, they nearly fought before entering the Azure Dragon Palace. A feud was the only logical explanation for Lin Yun’s intense killing intent.

Just a moment ago, everyone was wondering who was stronger. But after Lin Yun brought out his sky sword intent, no one had any hopes for Yu Haotian. If Lin Yun really made his move now, Yu Haotian wouldn’t be able to escape death. After all, how could Yu Haotian be stronger than Mu Xiuhan, Zhao Qi, Chen Hao, and Feng Xuanyi?

From the tail stage, Yu Haotian looked at Lin Yun without any fear in his eyes. He even flashed killing intent in his eyes. Yu Haotian silently circulated the origin energy within his body along with the Phaseless Demonic Art and Divine Glorymoon Fist.

Lin Yun’s sky sword intent was strong, but it was also Yu Haotian’s best opportunity to kill Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun had just fought with Mu Xiuhan, Zhao Qi, Chen Hao, and Feng Xuanyi. So Lin Yun must have exhausted a great deal of origin energy. Since Yu Haotian practiced the Divine Glorymoon Fist, he knew how exhausting it was to execute the last move. It was so exhausting that he knew that Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to use it again any time soon.

More importantly, Lin Yun was a decisive person who would’ve already charged over if he still had any strength. The more Yu Haotian thought about it, the denser the killing intent in his pupils became.

He longed for Lin Yun’s Divine Glorysun Fist because he was sure that it would be a powerful martial technique. If he combined it with the Divine Glorymoon Fist, who knew how strong it would get.

The moment he killed Lin Yun, all of Lin Yun’s treasures and opportunities would belong to him. It was as the demonic spirit said, Lin Yun was his god of wealth. As for the risk, he didn’t mind taking it. There was nothing absolute in the world, and he was willing to risk his life if he had a 10% chance of winning.

“Don’t be impulsive for now. He might be tempting you. You should make your move when you have absolute confidence. I can’t see through him right now.” The demonic spirit’s voice sounded out in Yu Haotian’s mind. But unlike its usual tone, it sounded really weak right now. It was almost like the demonic spirit was afraid of the plaza.

“Senior, I have already considered it. With that secret powerful artifact, I’m not afraid of falling into a trap,” said Yu Haotian with some reluctance.

“Calm down. You still have to obtain the inheritance here. The risk of fighting him right now is too great. It’s basically suicidal to do anythign right now. It’s not worth dying, especially with that demonic pet around,” said the demonic spirit. Yu Haotian’s face changed as he decided to listen.

“Wait till you’ve obtained the inheritance. With my help, there’s a high chance you can obtain the strongest inheritance. You just have to follow my instructions and I guarantee that your strength will double, if not triple. When that happens, no one will be able to compete with you!” The demonic spirit continued, “But you don’t have to hold back if he wants to fight right now…”

The demonic spirit’s voice gradually calmed Yu Haotian down. When he thought about what the demonic spirit said, it did make sense that it might be a trap.

“This fellow is becoming even more troublesome to deal with…” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because he was surprised that Yu Haotian actually held back.

He was initially planning to lure Yu Haotian over. With his current exhaustion, he wasn’t confident of taking Yu Haotian down if he started the fight. But if Yu Haotian came at him, he could execute the second form of the Three Heavenly Divides.

Even if he wasn’t in his strongest state, he was confident that he could give Yu Haotian a big surprise with the second form of the Three Heavenly Divides empowered by his sky sword intent. It was a shame that Yu Haotian didn’t fall for it.

Then again, he could deal with Yu Haotian after he recovered all of his strength. He might have revealed most of his strength, but he didn't fully reveal the Three Heavenly Divides or the Divine Glorysun Fist. So if Yu Haotian dared to show up before him, Yu Haotian would die.

At this moment, everyone slowly went back to their stages.

“Brother Lin, you’ve hidden your strength so well. It seems like your will spread throughout the Heavenly Path since you killed them with one sword,” smiled Luo Chen.

“I was just lucky,” replied Lin Yun. He had a favorable opinion of Luo Chen. Lin Yun could tell that Luo Chen was a lot stronger than Mu Xiuhan and had many trump cards hidden. Otherwise, Luo Chen wouldn’t have taken the advantage to befriend him.

“Sky sword intent can only be grasped by empyreans. The fact that you say it was luck is laughable. Brother Lin, you’re too humble,” smiled Luo Chen bitterly. Luo Chen could tell that Lin Yun had a few trump cards that could threaten him, but he didn’t think that it would be sky sword intent. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Lin Yun, if you’re not interested in this inheritance, I’m going to start refining it,” said Luo Chen.

Interested? Lin Yun was stunned and he realized what Luo Chen was saying. Luo Chen occupied the horns stage, which would greatly benefit Lin Yun as a swordsman. “I don’t have any interest,” said Lin Yun.

The horns stage might be suitable for him, but Luo Chen had taken the initiative to befriend him. Furthermore, he didn’t help Mu Xiuhan’s party earlier in the fight, so it wasn’t right for him to snatch Luo Chen’s stage. In Lin Yun’s honest assessment, the heart stage might not be any inferior to the horns stage.
