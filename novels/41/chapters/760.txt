Chapter 761 - One Punch

No one would have thought that Lin Yun would return at this critical moment. But he did, which excited the Sword Firmament Pavilion. The words that he said so domineeringly were filled with a deep killing aura and echoed throughout the mountain.

Lin Yun is back? Wen Yanbo was briefly stunned before he began to smile sinisterly, “You came back right on time. I was wondering where to find you. Come, let me cripple you now!”

“Sect master, something doesn’t seem right.” A few of the Primal Origin Sect’s members looked at Lin Yun with wide eyes.

“I’m here. What’s there to worry about?” Wen Yanbo coldly glared at Zuo Yun before he turned to look at Lin Yun and narrowed his eyes.

“You want to cripple me? Do you even have the capability to do that?” sneered Lin Yun.

Just when Wen Yanbo was about to get angry, he noticed something unusual. What’s that gigantic being behind Lin Yun? The Indigothunder Dragonvulture was extremely massive since it was over three hundred meters tall. Wen Yanbo had to raise his head to get a clearer look. When he did this, his face turned pale.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture slightly lowered its head and roared while unleashing its pressure. Wen Yanbo’s face changed as he was forced to bow under the great pressure. As for the Primal Origin Sect’s disciples and elders, they were sent flying from the roar while vomiting blood. As they hit the nearby rocks and hills, their bones nearly shattered.

“This…”

“Is that a demonic beast that Junior Brother Lin subdued? Isn’t it a little too terrifying?” The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples looked at this scene with disbelief in their eyes. The enormous demonic beast practically destroyed the entire Primal Origin Sect’s party with a single roar. Exactly how terrifying is this demonic beast?!

Luo Feng got back up and looked at the demonic beast with shock on his face. Even he couldn’t tell the demonic beast’s cultivation and origin.

“The Indigothunder Dragonvulture?” Zuo Yun narrowed his eyes with a great shock in his eyes. The shock in his heart couldn’t be described with words. Why is that infamous overlord demonic beast following Lin Yun?

“Lil’ Purple, don’t scare them.” Lin Yun smirked at the trembling Wen Yanbo. It took a while, but Wen Yanbo was finally able to get up. After the pressure was resolved, he let out a sigh of relief. When he turned back to look at his sect’s disciples and elders lying on the ground, his face had practically turned black. Several elders were crippled and all the disciples were killed.

“Lin Yun, you’re courting death!” Wen Yanbo sucked in a cold breath as he flew into a rage. The disciples he brought over actually died. They were the Primal Origin Sect’s elites! Consumed by his rage, he lost his rationale and charged towards Lin Yun.

When Wen Yanbo unleashed his Heavenly Soul Realm pressure fused with his dracophant energy, his aura surged like an ancient beast. Additionally, the image of a dracophant appeared behind him.

“Junior Brother Lin, be careful!” Everyone from the Sword Firmament Pavilion exclaimed at this sight. No matter what, Wen Yanbo was still a Heavenly Soul Realm expert. If Lin Yun was caught off guard, he could be killed by this attack.

Courting death! Lin Yun sneered inwardly. He had no idea what Wen Yanbo did to make a breakthrough, but his foundation was terrible. If a Heavenly Soul Realm of Wen Yanbo’s level was fighting at the beast tide, even a pinnacle Yin-Yang stage genius could easily crush him.

Azure Dragon Enneaform—Octaform!

Right when Wen Yanbo was about to reach him, Lin Yun clenched his fist. Using only thirty dragon runes, he threw a punch. When his punch collided with Wen Yanbo, the latter was actually sent flying.

When Wen Yanbo landed on the ground, he took several steps backwards to stabilize himself. At this moment, his eyes were full of disbelief. How is this possible?! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Wen Yanbo was a Heavenly Soul Realm expert, so he didn’t understand why he couldn’t kill a brat in the greater Yin-Yang stage. He couldn’t even believe that he was pushed back. Although he had only used a third of his origin energy in a hurry, he was still a Heavenly Soul Realm expert. So how could Lin Yun have injured him with just one punch?

This scene left everyone from the Sword Firmament Pavilion dumbfounded as Lin Yun had gotten a way too strong after one year.

“I don’t believe that I can’t kill you!” Wen Yanbo’s face was dark as he spoke. However, he didn’t dare to be careless as he accumulated his origin energy and dracophant energy within his body. With his next attack, he would go all out and kill Lin Yun. He couldn’t allow his pride as a Heavenly Soul Realm expert to be violated.

But when he was only halfway to Lin Yun, a colossal and sinister head appeared before him. The Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s head startled Wen Yanbo to the point where he didn’t dare to breathe loudly. But before he could retreat, the Indigothunder Dragonvulture opened its mouth and unleashed a soundwave, which sent Wen Yanbo flying out.

“Lil’ Purple, I told you that you don’t have to be so violent,” said Lin Yun indifferently, but his mocking smile sent chills down everyone’s spines.

Wen Yanbo stood up and looked at the Indigothunder Dragonvulture fearfully before he said, “Lin Yun, if you have the guts, don’t let this beast interfere. Fight with me openly and fairly!”

But when he called the Indigothunder Dragonvulture a ‘beast’, lightning began to accumulate in its mouth as it breathed out. This sent Wen Yanbo, who had just soared into the sky, flying back even further while vomiting blood. Wen Yanbo knelt on the ground from this. His face was pale since his injuries weren’t light.

“Lil’ Purple, you’re too playful. Look, Senior Wen can’t even get back on his feet.” There was no change to Lin Yun’s face and the mockery on his lips grew even colder.

“Sect master, that brat is humiliating you,” said the remaining Primal Origin Sect’s elders.

Wen Yanbo was startled by those words as he instantly figured out the situation. Despite Lin Yun’s words, the demonic beast still attacked him. Clearly, they were messing with him. They were trying to humiliate him from the get-go. For the bystanders, it was sad to see Wen Yanbo fall for Lin Yun’s trick.

“Lin Yun, I won’t let this matter go. I’ll settle this debt with the Sword Firmament Pavilion sooner or later!” Wen Yanbo’s face changed as he decided to leave. But just as he took several steps, the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s claw landed on the ground like a huge stone pillar, which made the ground tremble. The shockwave sent Wen Yanbo flying once again while vomiting more blood.

When the Indigothunder Dragonvulture lowered its head once more, Wen Yanbo panicked as he crawled on his hands and knees. When the Indigothunder Dragonvulture pulled its head back, Wen Yanbo’s face was ashen as he knew that it was impossible for him to escape with this demonic beast around.

But he was ultimately an ambitious and ruthless person of the Great Qin Empire, and he quickly did something that left everyone shocked. As a sect master, he actually kneeled before Lin Yun and lowered his head, “Lin Yun, please forgive me this once. The Sword Firmament Pavilion and Primal Origin Sect have been competing for so many years. There’s no need to be so ruthless, right?”

Zuo Yun was entirely disappointed when he saw this scene. Is this the master I once respected? He was completely disgusted by Wen Yanbo’s performance as he turned his head away. He never wanted to see this person again.

“Kneel.” Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with Wen Yanbo any longer and went over to Luo Feng. He asked, “Elder Luo, are you alright?”

“I’m fine. I won’t be dying anytime soon.” Luo Feng revealed a gratified smile.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun asked.

Luo Feng sighed as he told Lin Yun what happened over the past six months. The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s bitter days started when Wen Yanbo made his breakthrough into the Heavenly Soul Realm. It was so bad that Guardian Plum had no choice but to go into seclusion early on to make his breakthrough.

A cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes as he turned to look at Wen Yanbo, “I will let you go, but only if you can take three of my punches and stay alive.”

“Are you serious?” Wen Yanbo stood up with excitement flashing in his pupils before he soon suppressed it.

“You’re not willing?” Lin Yun asked.

“Young Master Lin is truly an extraordinary talent. I’m fully convinced by your breadth of mind. Come!” Wen Yanbo said, but he was sneering inwardly. He was confident that he could take ten punches from Lin Yun, let alone three.

Lin Yun didn’t waste any more time talking to Wen Yanbo and circulated thirty dragon runes on the surface of his body. Then, he threw out two punches. His attacks created a huge explosion and made Wen Yanbo turn pale. Blood dripped from Wen Yanbo’s lips as some of his internal organs had been torn apart.

Both punches nearly took half of his life. However, he had ultimately endured it and smiled, “One more punch.”

He was smiling, but the depth of his eyes was flashing with a cold, killing aura. But he had concealed it well and he only swore inwardly that he would turn the Sword Firmament Pavilion into a bloodbath. It didn’t matter how long it took, he would repay the humiliation he suffered a hundredfold!

“Are you thinking of taking revenge against the Sword Firmament Pavilion after I leave?” Lin Yun said.

Wen Yanbo’s heart sank and smiled, “You must be joking. But you won’t go back against your promise, right?”

“Of course not.” Lin Yun casually nodded his head. “You think that you can take my last punch?”

Wen Yanbo replied confidently and full of pride, “I’m a Heavenly Soul Realm expert and I’m pretty confident of myself. You can come at me anytime you want.”

“Heavenly Soul Realm? Zuo Yun, do you think he’s qualified?” Lin Yun laughed.

“Only on the surface, but deep down, he’s still worthless. He’s nothing compared to a genuine Heavenly Soul Realm expert,” said Zuo Yun. He had wandered around for the past year and gained many experiences.

When Wen Yanbo heard those words, he roared furiously, “I admit that I’ve failed today. But why are you humiliating me? Come and finish the last punch!”

Lin Yun’s expression sank as he snorted, “Interesting. You’re in the wrong, but you still have quite the temper. The entire Sword Firmament Pavilion would’ve been slaughtered if I didn’t come back in time. Did you forget how arrogant you were earlier? You, a Heavenly Soul Realm expert? Hmph. Let me fulfill your wish!”

Seventy-two dragon runes began to squirm on the surface of Lin Yun’s body before they formed a massive azure dragon that coiled around Lin Yun’s body. As lightning roared, Lin Yun clenched his fist together and the dragon runes poured into his fist. His entire right arm had turned into a sinister dragon. Then, the massive dragon on Lin Yun’s body came to life and caused the clouds to tumble.

“No!” Wen Yanbo’s face changed as he was completely dumbfounded. But before he could even react, Lin Yun’s punch had already reached him. Terrifying lightning poured into Wen Yanbo’s body like magma, which swiftly spread throughout his limbs. In a split second, his body turned red and then exploded.

Before Wen Yanbo could even issue a sound, he was blown into pieces. Not a single ash of Wen Yanbo remained.

“Heavenly Soul Realm? Haha!” Lin Yun relaxed his right hand with disdain in his eyes. A piece of garbage who was killed by me in a single punch dares to call himself a Heavenly Soul Realm expert? Wen Yanbo was an embarrassment to the Heavenly Soul Realm!
