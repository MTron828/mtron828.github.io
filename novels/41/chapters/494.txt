Chapter 495 - Let’s go!

His voice was so firm that it left many people shocked. After all, they couldn’t believe that Lin Yun had beaten Leng Yi back with only a punch, not to mention that he used one punch to defeat four elite disciples from the Bloodwing Pavilion. The Bloodwing Pavilion had been greatly humiliated.

Lin Yun’s strength had shocked everyone. Although Leng Yi was careless, it still proved that Lin Yun was strong. After all, he was only in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm. Just thinking about Lin Yun’s strength made them feel a chill run down their spine, not to mention the shock that Pan Yue felt.

He knew that if this continued, the Bloodwing Pavilion and Heavenly Province Academy would enter a war right here and that both sides would suffer greatly. In the end, the Indigoflame Goldlotus would only benefit others. Leng Yi could stand and fight with Lin Yun, but Pan Yue had to consider this matter from the Bloodwing Pavilion’s angle.

“Young Master Lin?” Pan Yue’s darkened face suddenly revealed a smile. “So you’re not from the Heavenly Province Academy. Since that’s the case, doesn’t that mean that we can be friends? How much are they paying you? I can offer twice the amount. Then again, you can consider the one thousand third grade spiritual jades as a gift from me as long as you nod your head.”

Many people cursed Pan Yue inwardly for his shamelessness, but some were filled with admiration for his decisiveness. He was able to determine that Lin Yun wasn’t from the Heavenly Province Academy, which meant that there was a possibility he could work together with Lin Yun. After all, benefits were most important and it would be a heavy strike to the Heavenly Province Academy if he succeeded.

The moment he spoke, the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples couldn’t help but feel nervous. Even Bai Yi was feeling anxious, but Liu Yunyan stopped her from doing anything.

“Are you trying to bribe me?” asked Lin Yun with a smile.

“I just want to be friends with you. After all, everything in the world has a price. I, Pan Yue, can offer you whatever Liu Yunyan offers. The Bloodwing Pavilion isn't any inferior to the Heavenly Province Academy,” persuaded Pan Yue when he saw that Lin Yun seemed to be attracted by his offer.

“That’s not exactly wrong,” smiled Lin Yun. His words made the Heavenly Province Academy’s party nervous as he continued, “Although I don’t like Liu Yunyan, she still treated my injuries and that silly lass over there saved my life. Everything has a price, but comradeship doesn’t. But I believe you won’t understand what I’m saying.”

Lin Yun wore a smile as he looked at Pan Yue, which made Pan Yue’s face turn dark. He had wasted his time and was fooled by Lin Yun. “Then we’ll see. A mere disciple from the Sword Firmament Pavilion dares to interfere in the affairs of the Bloodwing Pavilion? You won’t even know how you’ll die.”

“With the people that you brought? I’m afraid I won’t be threatened by them,” smiled Lin Yun. He might not be able to fight so many people, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t run away. Furthermore, it was still unknown as to who would win if he reached the Violet Palace Realm.

“I hope that you can maintain that mentality of yours,” smiled Pan Yue eerily as he glanced at those people in the surroundings. There were many people around, and he waved his sleeve, “Let’s go.”

Leng Yi looked at Lin Yun with reluctance. Before he left, his eyes were fixed on Lin Yun with a killing aura brimming in his eyes. He turned around and asked, “Brother Pan, why didn’t you let me kill that brat?”

Leng Yi was feeling depressed. Furthermore, he had only used half his strength. He thought that he would kill Lin Yun with it, but instead he suffered a great loss.

“Relax, we’ll play with them slowly. We’ll only benefit others if we fight. Since that brat is courting death, let’s fulfill his wish. You can deal with him in the fight for the Indigoflame Goldlotus,” smiled Pan Yue eerily.

“You can rest assured, if that brat underestimates me, he’ll die a terrible death,” said Leng Yi with a cold and sinister smile.

Pan Yue nodded his head. He was determined to get the Indigoflame Goldlotus and anyone who stood in his way would die. Since Lin Yun wanted to have some fun, he didn’t mind playing.

“Flower Burial, you really deserve your reputation,” said Liu Yunyan as she stood forwardh.

“I’m still lacking compared to you,” replied Lin Yun.

“In terms of strength, I might not be able to do anything against you. But the outcome won’t be so sure if I use my other means,” said Liu Yunyan. She was naturally pointing to her spiritual runes. She believed that Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to fight her if she used her spiritual runes.

Lin Yun smiled, but didn’t argue with her. He just hoped that she could retain her confidence when she witnessed his sword techniques. Furthermore, he also had other means.

Right at this moment, the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples’ expression became softer when they looked at Lin Yun. At the same time, they also looked at Lin Yun with reverence. No one dared to hold any opinions against Lin Yun anymore.

“That ‘comradeship’ of yours impressed me. Don’t worry though. I’ll fulfill my end of the bargain as long as you fulfill yours,” said Liu Yunyan. Lin Yun’s actions from before had changed her opinion of him.

“I’ll fulfill my part of the bargain since I made a promise. Furthermore, I also need the Indigoflame Goldlotus. Speaking of which, we should be reaching our destination soon, right?” asked Lin Yun. He could tell that there were many experts in the surroundings as each one took a spot as their camp. Lin Yun could guess that the Indigoflame Goldlotus wouldn’t be far from here.

“See that mist? That mist is the birthplace of the Indigoflame Goldlotus,” said Liu Yunyan as she nodded her head and pointed up ahead.

Following the direction she pointed at, Lin Yun realized that they weren’t far away. With their strength, it would only take half a day for them to reach the mist if nothing went wrong.

“So why isn’t anyone doing anything?” Lin Yun was curious as to why no one made a move.

“The Indigocloud Lake is formed by lightning and flame. This means that the mist also contains the two energies. You’ll be killed if you’re careless. We can only wait for the mist to dissipate,” explained a Heavenly Province Academy’s disciple.

This was Lin Yun’s first time seeing a lake formed by lightning and flame. Lin Yun then expressed his doubt, “Don't the birthplace of treasures usually have demonic beasts guarding it? This must also be the case for this Indigoflame Goldlotus, right?”

Lin Yun naturally had to brush up on his knowledge for the upcoming battle.

“There aren't any around the lake, but rumor has it that there’s a greater Yin stage overlord demonic beast at the bottom of the lake. It has been a century since it appeared, so I believe that it must’ve died during its tribulation. But we’ll encounter demonic beasts along the way,” said Liu Yunyan as she looked around. Occasionally, there were demonic beasts’ roars echoing out from the depth of the forest.

The demonic beasts were a variable in their journey to the lake and the unlucky cultivators who encountered a powerful demonic beast would have to call it quits on their journey.

“Oh, right.” Liu Yunyan thought of something and looked at Lin Yun, “You really took the one thousand third grade spiritual jades?”

“It was just luck,” replied Lin Yun.

“You’ve offended Leng Yi greatly this time. His master, the Nethercloud Ghost is known for his overprotectiveness. If the Bloodwing Pavilion pays a high price to get rid of you, they won’t care about our Heavenly Province Academy. That fellow is a demonic cultivator, so he has even lesser concerns,” said Liu Yunyan as she looked at Lin Yun with concern in her eyes. Lin Yun was surprised that Liu Yunyan would worry about his safety.

“Then what should we do?” Bai Yi instantly became anxious.

“That’s easy. He can just join our Heavenly Province Academy. With his talent, he can become a core disciple. There’s no need for him to become a guest deacon,” smiled Liu Yunyan as she tried to recruit Lin Yun. “Speaking of which, you also research spiritual runes, right? You can excavate your talent in that field if you join the Heavenly Province Academy.”

“Wow, Big Brother Lin also knows spiritual runes?” exclaimed Bai Yi. Not only him, but the other Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples were also shocked. Not only was Lin Yun strong, but he was also knowledgeable in spiritual runes.

Lin Yun sneered inwardly. He knew that Liu Yunyan had a motive. So it turns out that she was trying to recruit him. But he didn’t have any thoughts about it because he was Flower Burial of the Sword Firmament Pavilion for the upcoming Draconic Banquet. He could barely accept being a guest deacon, not to mention a disciple. He wasn’t one who would betray those who had helped him.

But just when he was about to reply, the mist before them suddenly crackled with lightning and flame. As the two energies intertwined, the mist started to disappear at a visible speed.

“The Indigoflame Goldlotus!” They could see the outline of the Indigoflame Goldlotus appearing, which caused all of them to become excited. The ground trembled as not only the human cultivators, but the demonic beasts took action.

Up in the sky, human cultivators began to streak across the horizon towards the Indigoflame Goldlotus. Even Liu Yunyan had a light flickering through her eyes as she spoke out, “Let’s go!”RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
