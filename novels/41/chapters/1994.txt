Chapter 1995 - Battle Begins!

It was Lin Yun with a pair of Golden Crow Wings behind him. The Golden Crow Wings were too striking in the Myriad Graves Valley. But the Blood Crow was too fast, and Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered about anything else. As a sword vibration echoed, the Flower Burial Sword turned into a streak of light, shooting at the Blood Crow.

The Flower Burial Sword left behind ripples as it flew forth. The Blood Crow screamed, letting go of Bai Qingyu to avoid the sword.

Bai Qingyu’s body fell from the sky, and she would probably have been heavily injured if she had fallen to the ground from such height. But a black shadow flashed, and Lil’ Red caught her. After catching her, Lil’ Red sighed, “So heavy.”

“You fat cat! How dare a pet like you call me fat!” Bai Qingyu was injured, but she roared when she heard Lil’ Red say she was heavy. But when she finished, she fainted right away.

Ten moves later, the Blood Crow was shredded as Lin Yun landed on the ground and held onto Bai Qingyu’s wrist. He said, “Just some ominous aura and her injuries aren’t serious.”

“This woman is too annoying. You should just let her die,” Lil’ Purple said in an annoyed tone.

“Let’s talk about it after she’s awake.” Lin Yun fed a pellet to Bai Qingyu and said, “Lil’ Red, you carry her.”

“Big Brother, she’s really heavy,” Lil’ Red muttered.

But the unconscious Bai Qingyu seemed to have heard it and muttered, “I’m not heavy.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling at this scene because she was actually concerned about her weight when she nearly died.

“She’s clearly heavy.” Lil’ Red said reluctantly as it followed behind Lin Yun.

Half a stick of incense later, three figures arrived. Ye Qinghong coldly said, “That golden radiance should be the Golden Crow Wings.”

Zhang Kui closed his eyes as a white radiance was being emitted from him, and the dust particles in the air began to shine with different colors. When Zhang Kui opened his eyes, his pupils squinted, and he could sense ten-odd different auras in the dust particles.

It turned out that Zhang Kui practiced an eye technique. Eye techniques were rare in the Kunlun Realm, with few inheritances. His eye technique was called the Myriad Demon Pupils, one of the oldest inheritances of the Zhang Clan. It was rumored that one could even change space upon being cultivated to the pinnacle.

“Aside from Ye Qingtian, there’s another person, Bai Qingyu. They just fought a Blood Crow,” Zhang Kui said.

“It is a little troublesome that Bai Qingyu is also here…” Ye Qinghong frowned.

“What trouble is there? This is the Myriad Graves Valley, and one or two dying makes no difference,” Xiao Jingyan smiled. “We can just say that Ye Qingtian killed Bai Qingyu, and the Bai Clan even has to thank us for it.”

Ye Qinghong and Zhang Kui were briefly stunned. They were both ruthless people, but they were inferior to Xiao Jingyan.

Ye Qinghong’s face changed, and he smiled, “This is a pretty good idea.”

“Junior Brother Zhang, lead the way,” Xiao Jingyan smiled. Zhang Kui didn’t say anything and chased in the direction Lin Yun left in. To the Zhang Clan, Ye Qingtian had to die today, no matter what.

It was practically certain that Ye Qingtian was behind what Zhang Yue suffered. Since Bai Qingyu was also here, they could only consider her unlucky.

Four hours later, Lin Yun stopped and decided to rest. Bai Qingyu had awakened. Her complexion was much better, and she had changed her clothes. She even recovered from the injuries on her shoulders after consuming a Profound Wither Pellet.

She was fine now, except that her complexion was a little ugly. She already realized that she would only hold Ye Qingtian down in the Myriad Graves Valley, which greatly struck her pride. She was initially optimistic that she could regain her confidence while being in the Myriad Graves Valley, wanting to save Ye Qingtian once. Otherwise, she would feel guilty about scolding Ye Qingtian in the future. But she didn’t expect to nearly die after coming to the Myriad Graves Valley, and Ye Qingtian having to save her again.

Even someone as prideful as her could no longer maintain her pride. Feeling depressed, Bai Qingyu muttered, “Ye Qingtian, you can leave. You don't have to care about me.”

“The exit isn’t far away. I’m fine if you want to leave, but I’m afraid it’ll be dangerous if you leave now,” Lin Yun said.

Bai Qingyu gritted her teeth and said, “Ye Qingtian, you actually hate me, right? You probably wished that I'd die here.”

Lin Yun didn’t say a word, but flicked his finger, flicking a green droplet from his body, creating a hole in a tree far away. He said, “This should be the origin essence of the Stalewater Sword. Because it’s not poisonous and is beneficial to cultivation, I didn’t realize it initially. You probably placed it on me when we fought and relied on it to track me.”

“When did you notice it?” Bai Qingyu asked in disbelief with her mouth wide open.

“When I drew out the Stalewater Sword,” Lin Yun replied.

Bai Qingyu was inwardly shocked. She never expected Ye Qingtian’s thoughts to be meticulous and had suspected her from the beginning. She horrifyingly asked, “So you pretended not to know and purposely lured me here?!”

“More or less, yeah. Since you’re out, at least you’re safer with me. If I forced it out of my body, you’d only wander around aimlessly, and you’d probably die over a hundred times in the Myriad Graves Valley,” Lin Yun said.

“So…” Bai Qingyu said.

“So you don’t have to care what I think of you. You’re Bai Shuying’s younger sister, and I won’t let you die here,” Lin Yun interrupted.

Bai Qingyu’s face became pale, and she couldn’t help trembling as she recalled everything that happened. It turned out that everything was within Ye Qingtian’s palms, and she was foolish not to discover it. When she looked at Ye Qingtian again, the pride and confidence engraved deep in his bones made her feel ashamed.

“What’s the matter? Your injuries have relapsed?” Lin Yun asked.

“No.” Bai Qingyu guiltily shook her head and changed the topic, “Ye Qingtian, did you take my elder sister’s…”

“No.” Lin Yun refused before Bai Qingyu could even finish her sentence. He then shared what he knew about Bai Shuying with Bai Qingyu.

“Who’s the person my sister has been waiting for?” Bai Qingyu asked.

“No idea, but that person is definitely not me,” Lin Yun replied.

Hearing what Ye Qingtian said, Bai Qingyu heaved a sigh of relief and snorted, “I knew that my sister wouldn’t take fancy to someone like you.”

“Indeed, but the person she fancied isn't good, either,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Bullshit!” Bai Qingyu rebuked, “The person my sister fancied must be a peerless hero. Most importantly, he must be graceful and have a backbone. Ever since she was young, my sister liked those with a backbone, rather snap than bend.

“That person must be famous in the Kunlun Realm, or my sister wouldn’t keep it a secret.” As Bai Qingyu spoke, she peeked at Ye Qingtian and continued, “My brother-in-law must be stronger and more dashing than you.”

“So?” Lin Yun asked.

Bai Qingyu snorted, “You’re really boring. Don’t you know how to hold a conversation? Do you know how many people want to flatter me? You’re not gentle at all.”

As they interacted, Bai Qingyu noticed that Ye Qingtian wasn’t that terrible and looked nothing like the rumors. When her depression disappeared, she looked like a cheerful beauty. If Bai Shuying was like a flawless jade, Bai Qingyu was the spring.

“Because you’ve never suffered before, you don’t know how gentle the world is. Gentle doesn’t mean being gentle with you. It can be a form of gentleness to live in the world,” Lin Yun replied.

“Ye Qingtian, what have you experienced? Why do I feel like you’ve gone through many life-and-death experiences? A genius swordsman like you should be vigorous. What are you hiding in your heart?” Bai Qingyu asked curiously.

“I have a sword hidden in my heart, and I have a lot of people to protect with my sword,” Lin Yun said.

“What does that mean?”

“Literally.”

While Bai Qingyu was furious, her Stalewater Sword sensed something and began to vibrate. Her face changed as she tremblingly said, “Ye Qingtian, the Stalewater Sword can sense murderous intent, and I have never seen it react so violently before.”

“Ye Qinghong and the others. They’re here for me; you don’t have to be afraid.” Lin Yun raised his head and could see several people coming over.

Not long later, Xiao Jingyan, Zhang Kui, and Ye Qinghong arrived. Ye Qinghong grinned, “As expected of you, Ye Qingtian. You have no intention of leaving, despite knowing that we’re here.”

“You think you people scare me? You’re just a loser,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

Ye Qinghong laughed, “I like your confidence. You’re so cocky just because you refined a saint origin. You might have become stronger, but you’re still as foolish as before. This isn’t the Heavenly Dao Sect!”

“What are you guys trying to do? We’re all saint disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect, and killing between disciples is forbidden!” Bai Qingyu said.

“Junior Sister Qingyu, this fellow tainted your sister’s reputation, so we’re just upholding justice today,” Zhang Kui grinned.

“Stop! Ye Qingtian was framed. You guys must get through me if you want to kill him!” Bai Qingyu stood before Lin Yun.

Xiao Jingyan, Zhang Kui, and Ye Qinghong exchanged gazes before they laughed. They found Bai Qingyu pitifully innocent. Xiao Jingyan smiled, “You think we’ll spare you? Both of you have to die today!”

When he said that, thirty-odd people appeared, surrounding Lin Yun and Bai Qingyu. They hovered in the air with their constellations behind them. They were all at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

They’re all loyal servants of the three clans, and each of them were much stronger than Third Master Lei. They weren’t afraid of dying at all.
