Chapter 494 - I'm Lin Yun, Also Known As Flower Burial!

Everyone turned to look at the direction the roar came from. An azure figure descended to the ground and stood before the Heavenly Province Academy’s party. His speed left many people shocked.

“The Nethercloud Ghost is famous, but his disciple is actually so low to bully a little girl?” sneered Lin Yun with disdain as he looked at Leng Yi. He was the one who provoked Leng Yi, but Leng Yi actually stooped so low as to bully a little girl. Lin Yun couldn’t help but look down on him.

In the next second, countless cold gazes looked at Lin Yun. Even the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples felt relieved. At the very least, they wouldn’t be implicated in the mess now.

Leng Yi narrowed his eyes into slits as he looked at Lin Yun with a cold light flickering through his eyes. The one thousand third grade spiritual jades came from him, so he used it to get Pan Yue to chase the Heavenly Province Academy away. So the fact that Lin Yun interfered in his affair couldn’t help but arouse his killing intent.

But when he noticed Lin Yun’s cultivation, he furrowed his brows together, “Quasi-Violet Palace Realm?”

It felt too unbelievable that someone in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm could force Leng Yi to retreat and suffer from the backlash of his array.

“This guy must be courting death to offend Leng Yi when he’s only in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm.”

“He might be something, but he’s nothing before Leng Yi. Leng Yi can easily crush him with a finger.”

“I’m afraid there’s nothing more to watch…”

Not only Pan Yue, but even those in the surroundings couldn’t help feeling disappointed. After all, Lin Yun wasn’t the show they were waiting for. Not only them, but even the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples were looking at Lin Yun in doubt. They might have witnessed Lin Yun’s strength, but they still couldn’t believe that Lin Yun could fight with genuine Violet Palace Realm cultivators.

After all, there were too many factors involved that night. But when Pan Yue looked at Leng Yi, he noticed that the cold aura around Leng Yi grew stronger, which made him doubt his previous thoughts.

“Haha, I let you off previously, so I never imagined that you would actually dare to show up again before me,” smiled Leng Yi with killing aura filling his eyes.

“You let me go? I think I remember a certain someone running with his tail tucked between his legs back then. In fact, he didn’t even dare to pick up his fallen mask,” smiled Lin Yun with his brow raised.

“This fellow’s guts are a little too big…” The disciples beside Liu Yunyan were surprised by Lin Yun’s speech. They were filled with doubt that Lin Yun could face Leng Yi and were surprised to see Lin Yun standing against Leng Yi so openly.

“Hmph, courage alone is nothing,” said one of the disciples with disdain.

Bai Yi bit on her lips as she tugged Liu Yunyan’s clothes. But Liu Yunyan showed no signs of helping, which made Bai Yi nervous.

Everyone in the surrounding looked at Lin Yun as they whispered among themselves. Lin Yun naturally knew about it, but he didn’t say a word as he continued to look at Leng Yi. He only had one thought right now, he wanted to use Leng Yi to test his current strength. If others knew about his thoughts, they would definitely laugh out loud.

“I don’t wish to waste my time with you today. If you’re tactful, you’ll hand over the spiritual jades. Otherwise, I don’t mind letting you have a taste of my means,” said Leng Yi sinisterly. The loss of a thousand third grade spiritual jades made him embarrassed before Pang Yue. So he had to get them back today.

“You’re really naive. How can I possibly return it to you now that they’re in my hands?” replied Lin Yun.

“You’re courting death!” Leng Yi was on the edge of losing control of himself. When his aura seeped out, it instantly made the surrounding atmosphere cold.

“Hold it. Brother Leng, there’s something strange about this brat. I suspect that he’s a chess piece Liu Yunyan brought out. Who knows if he’s going to drag you down with him. You’re my aide, so let’s have someone else test his strength,” said Pan Yue. He was a suspicious man by nature, not to mention that Lin Yun was only in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm. If he lost Leng Yi just because of Lin Yun, then it would be a great loss to him. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Although Leng Yi was unhappy, he still took a step back as four Bloodwing Pavilion’s disciples stood up from the signal given by Pan Yue. The four of them were in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm and were comparable to the eight titles in the Great Qin Empire.

Before Lin Yun could figure out what was going on with them, the four had already drawn their swords as they charged at him.

“Trying to probe me?” Lin Yun instantly understood what was going on, so he sneered inwardly, “Since this is the case, then all of you can kneel!”

When he unleashed the ancient dracophant energy, his temperament instantly changed.

“You’re courting death!” The four Bloodwing Pavilion’s disciples were enraged when they heard that. They were elites from the Bloodwing Pavilion, so how could they possibly accept the fact that they were being underestimated by Lin Yun? They instantly brought out their full strength without any hesitation.

In the next second, Lin Yun was enveloped by a sea of crimson light. The scene was rather terrifying, but Lin Yun merely smiled and he stretched out his right hand. This scene left many people shocked because they had no idea what Lin Yun was trying to do. Was he going to face their swords with his bare hand? The Bloodwing Pavilion was famed for their swords and their attacks couldn’t be blocked, even with ordinary profound artifacts.

“Idiot!” The four quasi-Violet Palace Realm cultivators sneered with disdain. Lin Yun was already a dead man in their eyes.

Pan Yue held onto his chin looking proud because this scene had ended up just as he thought it would. Lin Yun was just putting up an act. It would be a great loss if he really allowed Leng Yi to attack. Even Leng Yi couldn’t help feeling doubtful if Lin Yun was the same youth who fought him that night because the person who fought him didn’t seem to be a fool.

Just when everyone thought that Lin Yun was dead, an expected scene unfolded as Lin Yun clenched his fist. The dracophant energy began to boil like magma within his body and surged into his fist. When he threw out a punch, a roar was unleashed as Lin Yun turned into an ancient beast.

Dracophants were violet and ferocious creatures. So his punch made everyone feel the domineering grace of the ancient beast. In the next second, the four Bloodwing Pavilion’s disciples’ attacks were destroyed and then they threw up mouthfuls of blood.

Graceful Moment, Absolute Hit

Lin Yun then crossed his arms in front of his chest with both his thumbs pressing on his middle fingers. Then, he flicked his fingers and four silvery rays shot through the horizon.

When the four disciples landed on the ground, they fell to their knees as blood gushed out. Their knees had been pierced by the sword rays. Their faces were pale as they gritted their teeth and struggled to get up on their feet.

“Since you guys are already down on your knees, stay down!” sneered Lin Yun. A boundless dracophant energy pressed down on the four disciples as they were firmly pinned to the ground.

“T-they’re really on their knees.” This scene left many people shocked. Even Pan Yue’s face had turned dark from this scene.

“You’re courting death!” Leng Yi finally lost control of himself and threw out a palm. A gigantic bony palm formed in the sky, emitting a ghostly howl into the surroundings.

“Big Brother Lin, watch out!” exclaimed Bai Yi. Many of the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples also reacted.

“Great timing!” Lin Yun roared as the dracophant flame symbol lit up on his chest. Soon, the symbol spread throughout his body as his dracophant energy began to ignite and merge with his sword energy, forming boundless energy that poured into his fist.

When he threw his punch forward, a roar echoed out into the horizon. The powerful gale produced by Lin Yun’s punch made many people shut their eyes from the stinging pain.

Lin Yun’s punch shattered the crimson palm and Leng Yi was thrown out.

“So it turns out that you’re so weak. Are you a fake disciple of Nethercloud Ghost?” smiled Lin Yun. His words made Leng Yi throw up a mouthful of blood. But just when Leng Yi was about to charge forward once more, a palm fell onto his shoulder that stopped him.

Pan Yue looked at Lin Yun and asked, “Who are you?”

“I’m from the Great Qin Empire’s Sword Firmament Pavilion. I’m Lin Yun, also known as Flower Burial,” said Lin Yun as he carried his sword box and his clothes fluttered in the wind. The purple mark on his forehead made him look even more demonic.
