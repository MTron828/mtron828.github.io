Chapter 586 - Departure

Two days later, the news about the empyrean’s tomb spread throughout the Nether Prefectural City like a wildfire, enveloping the entire city instantly. All powers, from the Profound Yang Palace down to wandering cultivators, moved out towards the ancient tomb.

The tomb of an empyrean was attractive to everyone. After all, these were practically sovereigns of the Ancient Southern Domain back in the golden era. There was no doubt that an ancient empyrean could easily destroy a modern era empyrean.

So if anyone could obtain that empyrean’s legacy, they would soar to unimaginable heights. At the very least, they could obtain some treasure and become the lord of a region.

The Nether Prefectural City gradually became busier while Lin Yun finished inscribing the Ablaze Phoenix Painting. He had spent two days inscribing this painting, which took a lot of effort. But when he saw the nine paintings together, he revealed a satisfied smile on his exhausted face.

Lin Yun reached out with his hand and stored the painting carefully.

“Finally done!” Lin Yun was confident now that he had another trump card. However, he wasn’t in a hurry to meet the others as he first headed to the academy’s Beast Garden. Each sect had their own Beast Garden and they all varied in size.

Lin Yun was naturally here to look for the Dragon Blooded Horse. It wasn’t convenient for him to ride Lil' Red around in the academy, so he could only leave it in the Beast Garden. Therefore, Lin Yun decided to bring it for a stroll before heading to the ancient tomb.

Not long after, Lin Yun came to the Beast Garden’s deacon. When the deacon saw Lin Yun, his eyes lit up, and he quickly came up with a smile, “Young Master Lin, you’re finally here.”

“How’s my Dragon Blooded Horse?” asked Lin Yun.

The deacon’s face became stiff and he pointed his hand out, “Look at it yourself. I just fed it beast cores…”

Lin Yun instantly knew that something happened. When he went in, he saw Lil’ Red gobbling down on beast cores to the point that its mouth was stuffed. When it began to look around, Lin Yun instantly knew what it wanted to do.

“This fellow’s appetite is huge. I gave it twice the normal portion, but it wasn’t satisfied. It was only satisfied after snatching the other demonic beast’s beast cores. This fellow is clearly a horse, but it’s terrifyingly fierce. Several overlord demonic beasts here had been tamed by it,” said the deacon.

Lin Yun was placed in an awkward spot. He knew that beast cores were precious and only overlord forces would feed them to demonic beasts. As for the academy, it all depended on the spiritualist’s wealth. No wonder Lil’ Red was so happy here. So it turns out that it had become the overlord here.

Lin Yun replied, “Sorry for all the troubles it has given you.”

“Haha, it’s nothing. Missy Mo has already instructed me to treat it well. Furthermore, you’re the benefactor of the academy, and this is nothing,” smiled the deacon.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Lil’ Red slowly walking towards an Indigorunic Lion. The lion was suddenly kicked by Lil’ Red on its butt and it fell onto the ground trembling as it ran to the side. The lion could only watch as its beast cores were eaten by Lil’ Red. It didn’t dare to utter a word.

Lin Yun shook his head as he flicked his finger, sending out a sword ray that hit Lil’ Red and caused the latter to jump. But when Lil’ Red saw Lin Yun, it instantly revealed its iconic bucktooth.

At the Infernal Plaza, Zhang Yuan, Mu Chen and everyone else from the Heavenly Sword Sect were gathered. In addition to them, Liu Yunyan, Mu Xue, and Mo Ling were also present. They seemed to have arrived a long time ago, but it didn’t look like they were in a hurry to leave.

Finally, Mu Chen ran out of patience as he ranted, “Is that fellow coming? I heard that he has many enemies in the Nether Prefectural City and that the Bloodwing Pavilion has issued a bounty on him. Can it be that he’s afraid to show up?”

Mo Ling glanced at Mu Chen briefly and said, “He might not be coming, but it’s not because he’s afraid to come.”

“Is that so?” Mu Chen said with a playful smile as doubt was written on his face.

“What are you trying to say here? If you’re not willing to wait, then you can leave first,” said Liu Yunyan. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“He’s here.” Just when Mu Chen was about to say something, a youth and a horse came over.

Zhang Yuan glanced at Lin Yun before he turned to look at Lil’ Red with shock on his face. Everyone naturally brought their mounts for the journey, but those mounts were inferior to Lin Yun’s Dragon Blooded Horse. Everyone could tell that Lin Yun’s horse was a rare breed from the violent aura covering it.

When Lin Yun arrived, he greeted everyone before paying his respect to Tang Yu. Tang Yu nodded his head and spoke, “We’ll leave shortly, but I have some words to say before we go. The Withernorth Sea is an ancient battlefield and treasures have appeared occasionally. It’s a forbidden land, where even Yin-Yang stage experts might die. This journey is also for the tomb of an empyrean, so it’s extremely dangerous.”

This was nothing new as the Withernorth Sea was famed for being dangerous. If it wasn’t so, the news of the ancient tomb wouldn’t spread so quickly. But it would definitely be even more dangerous than Tang Yu had described.

Everyone left shortly after and the academy paid a great deal of attention to this matter. In addition to having a Heavenly Soul Realm expert like Tang Yu following the group, there were also dozens of Yin-Yang stage elders that joined.

The journey itself was dangerous, which necessitated such a huge party. If they got into conflict with other forces, even the Heavenly Sword Sect’s disciples might suffer without a Heavenly Soul Realm expert backing them up.

The empyrean tomb not only attracted the various forces, but also wandering cultivators. Many of the wandering cultivators were wanted by the various forces, to begin with, so they weren’t afraid of killing more of the sect's disciples if there were profits to reap.

Two hours later, the party arrived at a mountain range. It was the Flamecloud Mountain Range, a place they had to cross to head to the Withernorth Sea. Because of the empyrean tomb’s appearance, the Flamecloud Mountain Range was filled with people.

The Flamecloud Mountain Range was connected to several prefectures. Not only was it the biggest mountain range in the Nether Prefectural City, but it was also well known in the entire Ancient Southern Domain. Many powerful demonic beasts lived in this mountain range and took the lives of Heavenly Soul Realm experts.

People would rarely cross this mountain range, but this fear had been ignored momentarily. When the party arrived at the border of the mountain range, they could see people entering. Without a doubt, everyone’s destination was the Withernorth Sea and the empyrean's tomb, but it was uncertain how many people would actually make it.

It wasn’t safe even with a Heavenly Soul Realm expert. The most conservative estimate was that at least one-third of everyone who entered the mountain range would die.

“It’s the Heavenly Province Academy…”

“That must be the Lin Yun whose name has been making waves recently, right?”

“The Heavenly Sword Sect came as well. Wow, even Senior Tang came. What a huge formation!”

The Heavenly Province Academy’s party instantly attracted everyone’s attention because of their Heavenly Soul Realm expert. Lin Yun also drew attention since he had become a famous figure after the Five Academies Competition.

Compared to Lin Yun’s composure, Mu Chen flung his lips with disdain as he muttered to himself. He was someone who liked to compete, so he naturally felt unhappy that so many people knew Lin Yun’s name.

“Junior Brother Mu, don’t worry about him. He’s only famous because of Cao Zhen.”

“That’s right. If he didn’t beat Cao Zhen through luck, no one would know him.”

“You’ll surpass him sooner or later. He’s just someone from the Great Qin Empire, so how can he possibly compete with our Heavenly Sword Sect?” The other Heavenly Sword Sect’s inner disciples whispered.

Zhang Yuan, who was leading the party, turned around to glare at them, which made them shut up. Mu Xue was also in an awkward position. After all, she was also a disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect, but these people were talking about Lin Yun behind his back.

She sneaked a peek at Lin Yun who was behind her. When she noticed that Lin Yun was still calm and composed, she let out a sigh of relief. She was worried that Lin Yun might flare up. After all, she had personally witnessed Lin Yun slay three people in a fit of rage. Mu Chen and the other inner disciples definitely wouldn’t wish to experience Lin Yun’s rage.
