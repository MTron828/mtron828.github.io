Chapter 614 - Wind and Lightning, Rumbling Saintly Music

Qin An didn’t bother hiding his disdain for Lin Yun. But suddenly, a sword ray flashed over and left a sinister mark on the ground, which forced Qin An to come to a stop.

When Qin An came to a stop, he turned around to look at Lin Yun with rage brewing in his pupils. Lin Yun’s sword aura was a warning to Qin An, but at the same time, it was Lin Yun’s retaliation to Qin An’s arrogance.

“Are you blind or are you deaf? Didn’t you hear that I’m taking this blood essence?” Qin An looked at Lin Yun coldly.

“I won’t give this to anyone, even if Ji Wuye was standing here. So who the hell do you think you are?” Lin Yun replied as he sneered inwardly. Who did Qin An think he was? Even if Lin Yun had obtained the blood essence, he also wouldn’t let Qin An off. After all, he had to take revenge for the attacks Qin An launched at him earlier.

“Oh, I forgot that you managed to receive a palm from Ji Wuye. You should have some capability since you’re able to come this far, but I advise you not to be too arrogant because of that. Otherwise, you might lose your life.” Qin An revealed a smile that made others feel uncomfortable.

He really didn’t want to waste his time fighting with Lin Yun as he already made plans with Pei Yue to deal with the victor of Ji Wuye and Yan Kong’s fight on the eighth. They wanted to do this before taking the ninth level for themselves. Their plan was going smoothly since they eliminated Xie Yunqian.

With Xie Yunqiao gone, they only needed to find Ji Wuye or Yan Kong on the eighth level. But it would be better if he could obtain the Azure Dragon’s blood essence in the process. Additionally, fighting with Lin Yun would waste his time. But clearly, Lin Yun had no intention of leaving.

“You want my life? You can come and try then,” said Lin Yun as he raised his head. He wanted to know how strong Qin An was.

“How stubborn. Don’t regret your decision!” Lin Yun’s attitude had thoroughly enraged Qin An. Did Lin Yun really think that he could face him just because he received a palm from Ji Wuye? Since Lin Yun didn’t cherish his life, then Qin An had no intention of letting him off.

Qin An aimed his whip at Lin Yun as his origin energy erupted like a volcano. His whip caused distortions in the air.

Lin Yun’s face was indifferent as he pointed his fingers out like a sword and resolved Qin An’s attack.

“Another one with xiantian sword intent at greater mastery!” Qin An locked his brows together with fear flashing in his eyes. The fight with Xie Yunqiao wasn’t easy. Xie Yunqiao’s sword intent had caused a lot of trouble for Qin An and Pei Yue.

As long as a swordsman grasped the xiantian sword intent at greater mastery, they would be troublesome to deal with. They wouldn’t even need high cultivation to be troublesome. Qin An now understood why Lin Yun was so confident. But that didn’t mean that he would be defeated.

“Scarlet Whip—Boundless Flames!” Qin An barked as flames began to blaze on his body that illuminated the entire hall in red. At the same time, his aura began to rise frantically. Compared to Guo Xu, who Lin Yun defeated earlier, his aura was a lot more powerful. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Suddenly, the massive flames became as agile as a python. As Qin An made his move, countless whips began to descend from the surroundings. Every single whip was fast like lightning and the blazing energy created a sea of flames in the hall.

“Great timing!” Lin Yun swung out the spear in his hand like a sword. As he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, the densely packed sword rays were like geysers that twisted into a ferocious tornado.

“Heavenly Cloud Shatter!” Lin Yun roared as he destroyed all the whips coming at him.

When the sea of flames shattered, Qin An poured his origin energy into his whip, making his whip crackle with flames. Whenever the sparks landed on the ground, huge explosions could be heard. One could only imagine how much power had been poured into the whip. Qin An roared, “Blazing Inferno!”

Lin Yun was ultimately using a spear as a replacement for his sword, so there were some flaws here and there. When the whip flew over, Lin Yun’s sword aura began to crumble and he had to retreat.

When Qin An’s whip landed on the ground, towering flames spread throughout the hall. However, Qin An didn’t stop there as his whip chased after Lin Yun like a viper.

Lin Yun knew Qin An truly deserved his ranking as eighth on the outer ranking. But that wasn’t enough to make Lin Yun helpless as he threw the spear that had snapped into two and formed a seal with his hand.

Lin Yun was naturally forming the Seven Slaughtering Seal. When he unleashed the seal, Lin Yun’s killing aura suddenly multiplied by seven, making him seem like a fiendgod that came from hell.

“Omnipresent Anger, Raging Sky, Defiant Frustration, and Resonance!” The Seven Slaughtering Seal had multiplied Lin Yun’s killing aura to an unbelievable height as he threw his punches out. His punches were infused with sword aura and would make explosions that swept the hall in powerful gales.

Lin Yun’s punches were like the charge of a cavalry that shook the heavens and earth. So what if Qin An was eighth on the outer ranking? Lin Yun was strong and every punch from Lin Yun unleashed a crimson wave out.

With his last two punches, he shattered all the whips that enveloped him and hit Qin An in the chest.

Vomiting up blood, Qin An was knocked away and slammed into the wall. But he also quickly unleashed his counterattack in mid-air, “Apophis!”

The whip began to spiral as it rapidly expanded, manifesting a huge python that pounced at Lin Yun with its fangs.

With the snake’s jaw about to bite him, Lin Yun could sense his surroundings turn dark. It was as though the snake had really devoured the sun because of the abyssal darkness approaching him.

“Do you think you can turn the tables around?” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered with lightning as the wind and lightning energies circulated within his body.

As Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind, the purple lightning around him suddenly grew even more powerful. He was activating the Azure Dragon Enneaform’s Monoform.

Lin Yun soared into the sky and threw his punch out. When he threw his punch out, it was accompanied by the rumbling of saintly music and thirty thunderbolts overlapping each other.

The surrounding air seemed to have shattered like glass from the explosion. Qin An also fell onto the ground with blood leaking from his seven orifices. His face was pale. As for the domineering python, it had disappeared when the lightning surged forward.

When Lin Yun retracted his fist and landed on the ground, he didn’t look at Qin An as he turned his attention to another tunnel. He could hear footsteps sounding out. As the footsteps approached, Lin Yun could sense that the Flower Burial Sword within the sword box had begun to emit a buzz.
