Chapter 372 - Attempting to Breakthrough

On the fifth level of the Black Lotus Palace, Xin Yan and Chen Xuanjun were both joining together to seize the treasure from the Lotus Treasure Stage. The two had a decent harvest along the way and Xin Yan had successfully reached the ninth stage.

Chen Xuanjun, on the other hand, could sense his bottleneck in the tenth stage had loosened. Even if he couldn’t make a breakthrough in the Demonlotus Realm, he was confident that the breakthrough would come within half a month.

They had become drastically stronger, especially Xin Yan. Her Bloodflame Sword had reached complete mastery and her attacks were like the snow, the way that the blood roses drifted around. But even with the two of them joining forces, they still couldn’t defeat their opponent. Instead, they were being suppressed.

“Do you still want to continue?” Shui Wuhen pushed the two of them back with a palm. Then, he looked at them with a smile on his face while gently fanning himself.

Xin Yan’s eyes radiated with reluctance, but she was stopped by Chen Xuanjun. “Brother Wuhan didn’t use the Mistcloud Sword.”

Thank you for the win.” Shui Wuhen waved his hand at them and took the treasure on the Lotus Treasure Stage with a satisfied expression.

Xin Yan and Chen Xuanjun both shook their heads gently with disappointment. There was nothing they could do since they were the weaker party.

“I believe Brother Wuhen has a chance at becoming one of the eight titles in the Dragon Gate Competition this year,” said Chen Xuanjun.

“That’s impossible. The eight titles’ strength is more terrifying than you think. Putting it in a nutshell, you can’t become one of the eight titles if you don’t possess the strength to kill a cultivator in the initial Violet Palace Realm. But in three years? Well, it might be possible.” Shui Wuhen smiled and disappeared from the Lotus Treasure Stage.

Xin Yan sheathed her sword and sighed, “It’s a pity that I can’t injure him.”

“You want to reduce the pressure for junior brother?” asked Chen Xuanjun with a smile.

They knew that they weren’t Shui Wuhen’s opponents the moment they fought. Even in the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Sky Ranking, Shui Wuhen could be ranked among the top three. But knowing that, they didn’t stop. They knew that Shui Wuhen would ultimately become one of Lin Yun’s competitors, so they wanted to help Lin Yun by weakening Shui Wuhen.

Xin Yan smiled, “Senior Brother, how far do you think junior brother can go?”

Chen Xuanjun pondered briefly before he spoke out, “At least the seventh level. If he’s lucky, he might even be able to reach the eighth stage. As for the ninth stage, I’m not too sure about that.”

It was a fair evaluation. Normally speaking, one could be proud if they could reach the sixth stage. There weren’t many who could reach the seventh or eighth stage. After all, this meant that they would become one of the biggest winners in the Demonlotus Realm.

As for the ninth level, it had been a thousand years since anyone reached it. Then there was the legendary tenth stage. It had been too long since someone ascended it.

Xin Yan was filled with emotion when she heard Chen Xuanjun’s words. The junior brother that needed her protection had suddenly grown so powerful. It had just been a year ago when they first met, but it felt like so long ago that she nearly forgot about it.

Collecting her thoughts, Xin Yan smiled, “Senior Brother Chen, do you want to give the sixth level a try?”

“Nah.” Chen Xuanjun shook his head. “The sixth level is practically only for people like Shui Wuhen. It’s fine if we bump into Shui Wuhen, but it’ll be troublesome if we encounter any demonic cultivators. Those people won’t give us the chance to crush our jade slips.”

Crushing the jade slip only took a second, but real experts could kill you a dozen times during that period. And it was without a doubt that those in the sixth level all had the strength to do it.

“Let’s go. Elder Luo Feng and Senior Brother Xin Jue must be worried about us,” smiled Chen Xuanjun. He had a decent harvest in the Demonlotus Realm and it wouldn’t be long before he made a breakthrough. As long as he could make a breakthrough, then reaching the Violet Palace Realm before the age of twenty-five wasn’t impossible.

“Let’s go.” They would be forcefully teleported out if they stayed in the fifth level for too long. The two crushed their jade slips and left the palace.

The Extermination Barrens were filled with more and more disciples that were being sent out. The fifth level of the Black Lotus Palace was where the tier level changed.

About 99% of the disciples had been eliminated, but many sects had ended their journey in the Demonlotus Realm even before this. But for those who made it out, their strength drastically improved. The lucky ones even managed to bring out ancient martial techniques and secret artifacts.

But a lot of people had left their lives in the Demonlotus Palace for eternity. The Blackgold Sect was one such example. The Demonlotus Realm was a place with both opportunity and danger.

“Xin Yan!” yelled Xin Jue.

“Big Brother!” The siblings both revealed a smile when they met. All the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples were gathered together, except for Lin Yun. It was unquestionable that the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples were lucky this time. They didn’t suffer any deaths and they even had a decent harvest.

“Where’s Lin Yun?” asked Luo Feng.

“He should be at the sixth level by now. Elder Luo Feng, you don’t have to be too worried about him,” said Chen Xuanjun. He then went on to explain Lin Yun’s growth in the Demonlotus Realm.

“That brat has really brought honor to the pavilion.” Luo Feng could guess this, even without Chen Xuanjun telling him about it. The disciples who could remain in the Black Lotus Palace now were all monstrous geniuses.

“The Demonic Moon Villa’s Shui Wuhen is still inside. He’s probably at the sixth level now.”

“The Hundred Beast Gate’s Feng Ye is there too.”

“Don’t forget about Demonflame Sect’s Bai Yue…”

“The Bloodbone Gate’s Mu Xiuhan, Sevendespair Palace’s Jing Jue, Heavenly Profound Sect’s Tang Yuan, and Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Lin Yun are still inside.”

“Wow, I’m certain that they’re the biggest winners in this Demonlotus Realm. But I wonder who will be the final winner.”

“Hehe, naturally our Bloodbone Gate’s Mu Xiuhan will be. Who can possibly defeat him?”

“In my opinion, the Sevendespair Palace’s Jing Jue isn’t inferior in any way to Mu Xiuhan.” All the sects were discussing among themselves.

The Primal Origin Sect’s Wen Yanbo swept his glance around with a dark expression. He was rejoicing inwardly when he didn’t see Zhang Yan, Zhao Quan, and Xiao Ming. He didn’t need to guess to know that those three must have made it to the sixth level.

The three had a huge advantage in numbers, so there was a possibility that the Primal Origin Sect’s harvest might shock everyone. At that time, not only would he slap Luo Feng’s face, but it would also make everyone look at the Primal Origin Sect in a different light. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Right at this moment, a Primal Origin Sect’s disciple held onto two jade slips and rushed to Wen Yanbo nervously. Before Wen Yanbo could even ask, the disciple leaned over and whispered.

“What? That’s impossible!” Wen Yanbo’s face changed. His expression was replaced with rage and disbelief.

“It’s true. I personally witnessed it when I was hiding in a corner. These are the two senior brother’s jade slips.” That disciple handed the jade slips over nervously.

When Wen Yanbo examined the jade slips, he could feel his entire world spinning. When he recovered from the shock, he spoke out solemnly, “Keep this news to yourself.”

Wen Yanbo returned to the camp and told the other elders that Zhao Quan and Xiao Ming were both killed by Lin Yun. This news instantly left all the elders shocked. Zhao Quan and Xiao Ming were both core disciples of the Primal Origin Sect and they were groomed after spending an astronomical sum of resources.

Although their ranking might be towards the rear, they were still core disciples. Most importantly, they were sent here to kill Lin Yun. However, they were killed by Lin Yun instead. The elders instantly flared up and wanted to head to the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s camp immediately.

“Elder Wen, what do you think?”

“Let’s calm down for now. We still have Zhang Yan. Zhang Yan is stronger than those two, so he must have a harvest in the Black Lotus Palace. He can make up for our losses if he can reach the eighth level,” said Wen Yanbo coldly.

“Right, we still have Zhang Yan!”

“Zhang Yan’s Flamecloud Palm is already in complete mastery. It’ll be easy for him to kill that brat if his cultivation can reach the tenth stage.”

The elders comforted themselves after their brief disappointment. But they didn’t know that Zhang Yan died before Zhao Yuan and Xiao Ming did.

After Lin Yun got through the sixth level, he wasn’t in a rush to head to the Lotus Treasure Hall. He found a secret chamber and took out a beast core and a painting.

The beast core naturally belonged to the Indigo Thunderfiend Dracoape and the painting was naturally the ancient dracophant’s Dao Insight Diagram. It was inevitable that he would have to face the experts from the other sects if he wanted to reach the tenth level, not to mention that he had to face the white-clothed man in the end.

Lin Yun pondered briefly and decided to try and make a breakthrough to the fifth stage of the Dracophant Battle Physique. He was rather confident about it with the beast core and the Dao Insight Diagram.
