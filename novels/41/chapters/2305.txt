Chapter 2306 - Hard To Keep A Woman Around

Lin Yun entered the Iris Secret Realm with all the treasures. Lil’ Purple was stunned beneath the Phoenix Tree when she saw them before she exclaimed, “Lin Yun, you went out to rob them?”

“Cut your nonsense!” Lin Yun patted Lil’ Purple’s head, and continued, “They’re gifts from that holy master.”

“How generous. That holy master is extraordinary,” Lil’ Purple chuckled as she shoved various fruits into her mouth. She even called Lil’ Red over to join in the feast. “This is the Frost Cloud Fruit, the Heaven Aquatic Fruit, the Sacred Flame Fruit… They’re all snacks I like.

“The Divine Phoenix Fruits and Divine Phoenix Pellets!” Lil’ Purple was shocked as she breathed deeply, “Holy shit. Is that old man planning to take you in as his son-in-law?”

“Even you’re shocked?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

“They’re precious treasures, and I can be sure that even Divine Phoenix Mountain doesn’t have many of them. They can only be refined by the divine blood of a pure-blooded phoenix. Scumbag, give me half!” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun pitifully.

“You can have all of them,” Lin Yun smiled.

Lil’ Purple chuckled, “No can do. I just want half of them; you can use the remaining half for yourself. They should be enough for you to reach the third-stage Saint Lord.”

“They're that powerful?” Lin Yun was shocked. This was his first time coming in contact with Divine Phoenix Fruits and Divine Phoenix Pellets, so he didn’t know their value. But after hearing what Lil’ Purple said, he finally knew how valuable they were.

“There are more treasures.” Lin Yun took out the crystal bottle containing the divine dragon saint liquid.

Taking possession of it, Lil’ Purple was shocked, “Is the holy master planning to make you his son-in-law? I’ll tell you first that I won’t agree to it.”

“So… you want me to return them?” Lin Yun teased.

“No way,” Lil’ Purple said. She continued, “Use them now but save one-third of the divine dragon saint liquid. It’s enough for the Phoenix Tree to activate the array again.”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“It has been hard on you,” Lin Yun said as he looked at the Phoenix Tree.

The Phoenix Tree began to rustle as though it was feeling shy. The Othershore Flower also crawled out from Lin Yun’s sleeve upon hearing that there was more divine dragon saint liquid.

“Hehe, this flower has sharp ears. Don’t worry, since I’m not a stingy person. I know you’ll form your bud, so I won’t forget you,” Lil’ Purple smiled. “I’ll be going first.”

Lil’ Purple hopped on the ground, and Lil’ Red smiled upon seeing that Lil’ Purple shared half of the Divine Phoenix Fruits and Divine Phoenix Pellets.

Looking at Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red playing together, a smile rose on Lin Yun’s face. He immediately removed one-third of the divine dragon saint liquid, poured it on the ground around the Phoenix Tree, and let the Othershore Flower head over.

The Othershore Flower swayed, and said, “Thank you, Master.”

“You’re being too polite. After all, we must fight together in the future,” Lin Yun smiled, caressing the Othershore Flower.

“Don’t worry, Master. I will protect you well,” the Othershore Flower said seriously.

Lin Yun smiled as he refined the Divine Phoenix Fruits and Divine Phoenix Pellets. It was as Lil’ Purple said. They contained unimaginable power, raising his saint energy and vitality.

When two days passed, Lin Yun gave off a dazzling radiance with his saint energy revolving within his violet palace like a Yin-Yang Millstone. This meant that Lin Yun had become a third-stage Saint Lord.

But that wasn’t all. Saint radiance was shining from Lin Yun’s vitality. He was enveloped in a golden radiance and his cultivation soon consolidated at the peak of the third-stage Saint Lord.

“This is really magical.” Lin Yun let out a breath. When he tested his current strength, the power of his saint energy had increased by thrice.

“What’s magical?” Lil’ Purple came over with her skin faintly radiating.

“What’s your current cultivation?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s a secret,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

Lin Yun raised his brow because it looked like Lil’ Purple had greatly benefited and was probably close to transforming.

“I have a question. Why can’t my Divine Light Sword Intent tear apart the Scarlet Radiance Saint Lord’s Fire Dao?” Lin Yun asked.

“It's the difference in the numbers of saint daos. His Fire Dao has many more saint daos, so his Flame Intent naturally became more powerful.” Lil’ Purple continued, “Furthermore, he has a high attainment in his Flame Dao, and his phoenix bloodline empowers it. Judging from his saint dao, he should be a senior with a cultivation at Saint Sovereign, at the very least.”

Lin Yun frowned, “There’s nothing I can do about it since my saint dao can only increase with time.”

“Stop cultivating and have a spar with me,” Lil’ Purple said with boiling fighting spirits.

“Are you sure about that?” Lin Yun smiled.

Lil’ Purple planted her arms at her waist and smiled, “Are you looking down on me? At the very least, I can easily crush that Scarlet Radiance Saint Lord while in the Iris Secret Realm.”

What she said wasn’t boasting, since she was in full control of the Iris Secret Realm and had the help of three Sovereign Divine Runes and the Phoenix Tree. So if she was to go all out here, even Lin Yun couldn’t be her opponent.

“Let’s spar, then. I’ll use the Nirvana Sword Art while you…” Lin Yun pondered, then said, “Can you mimic the Scarlet Radiance Saint Lord?”

“Of course. I even know more than him.” Lil’ Purple wore a smug expression.

“Let’s start, then,” Lin Yun said, lighting up his eyes.

While two days have passed in the Iris Secret Realm, it hadn’t been long in the outside world, since it was still during the day.

In Ji Zixi’s residence, the holy master silently came by and looked at Ji Zixi, who looked restless. He asked, “Why are you unhappy?”

Ji Zixi was still in her innocent age. She was in a daze but rejoiced when she saw the holy master. She smiled, “Father, why are you here?”

“I’m naturally here to look at my beloved daughter. Tell me, why are you unhappy? Are you blaming me for splitting you up with Lin Yun?” The holy master asked.

Ji Zixi smiled, “It’s not that. Divine Phoenix Mountain has prepared for many years to get the divine flame fragment, so I naturally don’t dare to be careless. I want to tour Big Brother Lin around the Divine Phoenix Mountain once I form the divine physique.”

Her face had an innocent smile and a hint of sorrow and maturity.

The holy master said, “It has been tough on you.”

Ji Zixi smiled, “It’s not tough. I know the burden I must bear and can’t just think of myself. Divine Phoenix Mountain has treated me as a treasure since birth, with everyone doting on me, so you don’t have to say anything. I’m not a princess, but I'm treated better than a princess. I know all about it.”

While looking at Ji Zixi, the holy master couldn’t help feeling heartache as he embraced Ji Zixi. After he comforted her, he smiled, “They were all wondering if Lin Yun will become the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s son-in-law. What do you think? I’ll help you probe him if you’re interested.”

“What?” Ji Zixi blushed, but said, “Big Brother Lin already has a wife. He got married in the Heavenly Void.”

“That doesn’t matter. I’m here to discuss something with you,” the holy master smiled.

“What is it?” Ji Zixi asked.

The holy master smiled, “Do you want Lin Yun to accompany you in that realm? I can help you with that.”

He still didn’t know what Lin Yun was thinking before last night, but he was sure now. If the Sinful Fire Divine Rune could make Lin Yun agree to it, the price would be worth it.

“Really?” Ji Zixi was briefly stunned before she rejoiced.

Seeing this, the holy master knew why Ji Zixi was unhappy earlier. He nodded, “I probed him last night, and he’s outstanding, not to mention that he can accept a loss. Let’s not mention if it will succeed, but he can at least protect you in that realm.”

“You can’t do that,” Ji Zixi said. “Don’t mention it again. He must be concerned about his master’s tribulation now, and he will regret it for the rest of his life if he can’t make it back in time.”

The holy master was stumped upon hearing that. Ji Zixi was already standing on Lin Yun’s side before she had even married him. She even went as far as stopping him.

“Don’t talk about it again. I know he won’t refuse you, but I don’t want that,” Ji Zixi said seriously.

The holy master looked helpless and unhappy. He felt that his daughter no longer belonged to him.

At night, Lin Yun stood before the temple and could feel a chill down his spine when he got here. He felt bad and said, “Empress, why can I sense murderous intent?”

When he raised his head, he saw the holy master looking at him with an ‘amicable’ smile. Since the holy master couldn't lay his hands on his daughter, he decided to vent it all on Lin Yun. He laughed, “Flower Burial, come! I have been waiting for you!”
