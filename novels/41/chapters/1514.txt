Chapter 1515 - Stop Acting (2)

On the second level, Lin Yun visited many halls, but it appeared that he was pretty unlucky because all the treasures were already taken by someone else.

Meanwhile, An Liuyan and Xiao Yun had a decent stroke of good luck because they made it through the trial on the second level and arrived on the third level. As time passed, more and more people were teleported out of the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.

The more news the seven demonic sects received, the more confident they were that the Blue Dragon Palace was a trial. This naturally made all the demonic sects disappointed.

After all, such a trial tower wasn’t rare, and they could occasionally be found in the thirty-sixth layer of heaven. Every single time, they would receive a huge opportunity. At least, they were certain that there would be a Divine Dragon Bone on the ninth level.

But trial towers similar to this were generally under the control of the Divine Dragon Empire, and it was rare for anyone to have the opportunity to dip their hands in them. So this was a rare opportunity for monstrous geniuses at the Elysium Core Realm.

But opportunities were the best they could obtain, and they had no connection to the rise in power of the nine emperors. So they should just pay attention to who could ultimately obtain the Divine Dragon Bone.

Compared to the Divine Dragon Bone, saint elixirs were nothing. If the Divine Dragon Bone fell into the hands of a demonic sect, it would give birth to a supreme powerhouse.

Two figures descended into the asteroid belt. They were naturally An Liuyan and Xiao Yun. The two of them were pretty lucky, and their journey was smooth. But they failed during the fifth trial and had to fend off a hundred attacks from the hands of the gatekeeper.

Under the same cultivation, it was too hard to fend off a hundred attacks from an opponent with the firmament sword intent.

“You also failed at the fifth level?” Xiao Yun asked, looking at An Liuyan.

When An Liuyan nodded, she asked, “Did you see Lin Yun anywhere?”

“No. He should be faster than us, right?” Xiao Yun said in a certain tone.

“Let’s just wait.” An Liuyan wasn’t worried about Lin Yun’s safety in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. She was only concerned about how he would leave when he came out of the astral realm.

But Xiao Yun had guessed wrongly. Lin Yun was slower than them in the trial. It’s just that when the two of them were eliminated, Lin Yun had just gotten through the fifth trial and faced the trial on the sixth level.

He was pretty lucky this time because there was a box in the hall. But the ground was littered with corpses, and a person was standing before the blue stage. This person was donned in saint armor, radiating a powerful vitality.

When this person heard Lin Yun’s footsteps, he turned around and was surprised before he wore a playful gaze. This person who was donned in saint armor was naturally Tian Jue’s lackey, Jin Ao.

“Haha, what a coincidence!” Jin Ao looked at Lin Yun with a smirk, his eyes radiating with a chill. Back then, he was careless and was lifted by Lin Yun. He had been looking for an opportunity to cleanse the humiliation. But Lin Yun was a body-refining cultivator and still useful to Tian Jue. So he could only bear it all despite the fury that had built up within his heart.

But now that they were in the trial tower, he no longer had any reservations and didn’t have to hold back. The trial tower was in chaos, and the seven demonic sects were fighting amongst themselves. This was the same for those who came from the same demonic sect. So he had no reservations about killing a guest since Lin Yun no longer had any value.

“So, how do you want to die?” Jin Ao sneered.

“Uh, I still haven’t lived enough yet.” Lin Yun replied honestly.

“Haha, that’s not your choice!” Jin Ao laughed as he came before Lin Yun. His punches were like bolts of lightning as they were aimed at Lin Yun’s face, and the sheer force of his punches even caused sonic booms to echo within the air.

As the surrounding space trembled, Jin Ao’s explosive punches reached a terrifying height. Clearly, it made no sense for Jin Ao to catch Tian Jue’s attention if he didn’t have anything special about him.

But it was a pity because no matter how powerful Jin Ao’s punches were, his punches couldn’t even brush through the corner of Lin Yun’s clothes.

When Lin Yun pushed the Divine Sunchasing Art to the limit, he began to teleport around with his sheer speed. It also left faint ripples in the air, and he came out unscathed under Jin Ao’s ferocious attacks.

“H-How is this possible?!” Jin Ao’s mouth was wide open with disbelief.

But Lin Yun took this opportunity and poured all eight thousand dragon runes into his hand. Then, his right hand manifested into a dragon claw and a terrifying storm simultaneously appeared.

Taking Lin Yun’s attack head-on, Jin Ao took three steps back and threw out a mouthful of blood; his face instantly became pale. This instantly enveloped Jin Ao in fear because he realized he couldn’t see through Lin Yun. “J-Just who the hell are you? How can you possibly be An Liuyan’s subordinate with how strong you are?!”

“Oh? You realized it?” Lin Yun shrugged and replied, “I initially wanted to be a good person since you guys brought me here. After all, we cooperated once before, but that only brought me humiliation and mockery. So I’ll stop acting now. I’m actually an unprecedented genius in the sword path. I’m also the disciple of one of Eastern Desolation’s three sword saints, the Radiant Sword Saint. I am Lin Yun, who happens to be the strongest of the Sword Sect’s Earth Ranking.”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But before Jin Ao could react, Lin Yun already took a step forth and thrust forth. His attack was swift, but just when his sword was about to reach Jin Ao, the saint armor that Jin Ao was wearing released a ripple, and the Flower Burial Sword was knocked away. The powerful rebound force made Lin Yun spin in mid-air to appease the energy.

“Ha!” Jin Ao’s eyes flashed with mockery. He snickered, “You think that the saint armor I’m wearing is the same as yours? Why don’t you use your head and think about how I managed to make it through the fifth trial? You really know how to boast. The Radiant Sword Saint no longer takes disciples. You dare claim to be his disciple? If you’re his disciple, then I’m the Sword Sect’s Sect Master!”

When Lin Yun looked at Jin Ao’s Flame Dragon Saint Armor, it was different, just as the latter said. This was because the core seemed to contain a droplet of the Flame Dragon True Blood.

“I suddenly recall it now…” Jin Ao revealed a cruel smile. “You’re still wearing the Flame Dragon Saint Armor. So you can get down on your knees now!”

When he was done, he began to form seals to try and control Lin Yun. He had used this move back in the grey fog when Ding Lei wasn’t obedient.

“You want to compete with me in saint artifacts? I’m afraid that you’ve found the wrong person!” Lin Yun stowed the Flower Burial Sword and walked towards Jin Ao. He wasn’t the slightest bit afraid that he would be controlled by the latter.

But Jin Ao snorted and was finally done forming his seal. Just when he let out a roar, he was stumped by what happened next. The Flame Dragon Saint Armor that Lin Yun was wearing suddenly exploded.

As Jin Ao widened his eyes, he saw Lin Yun taking out an umbrella from his interspatial bracelet. Everything happened too quickly, and Jin Ao could only cross his hands before him to block Lin Yun’s attack. But when the umbrella descended, Jin Ao immediately fell to the ground without resistance.

The umbrella was too heavy, and the weight covered his forehead in beads of sweat since blocking the umbrella was the same as bearing the full weight of a mountain.

But Lin Yun didn’t do anything except slam the umbrella down again and again. Whenever the umbrella landed on Jin Ao, Jin Ao threw out a mouthful of blood. Three attacks later, Jin Ao and his saint armor fell apart. Just like that, Jin Ao died a terrible death.

“Why couldn’t you just believe me…?” Lin Yun shook his head and stowed the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella before making his way to the blue stage. He was on the sixth level, and he was looking forward to seeing what treasure he would receive.
