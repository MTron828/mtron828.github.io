Chapter 1197 - Not Done Yet!

The sound of the sword shattering was crisp as it sounded beside everyone’s ears. Everyone was left dumbfounded by this scene as the Incineration Sword broke into ten pieces. No one could believe what they were seeing. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“The… sword… broke?” No one could believe that a valuable sword was broken.

“How is this possible?” Zhao Yan was completely dumbfounded. The Incineration Sword was comparable to a thousand rune saint artifact, so there was no way it could have shattered.

Gong Haoran’s mouth dropped as he lost all ability to speak. As for Feng Xiaoyu, Feng Xingyang, and all the Feng Clan’s disciples, their faces were pale because the broken sword was a destructive blow to the Hidden Sword Pavilion’s reputation.

“Oh my god, just what the hell is going on? The Incineration Sword broke? Why did it break all of a sudden?”

“Did Lin Yun break it on purpose?”

“Who knows. Maybe Pavilion Master Feng’s crafting skills have declined.”

“But this doesn’t make any sense. Pavilion Master Feng is a heavenly spiritualist!” The plaza burst into an uproar when they recovered from their shock. Ye Feifan was also briefly stunned before he smiled. Lin Yun dealt with the entire Sword Assembly, and now his work was complete.

Feng Xiaoyu had already become a laughingstock, but Feng Xuanzi was shrewd and knew that everyone’s attention would be captivated by the sword the moment it appeared. So he wanted the powerful sword to be praised by everyone.

The Sword Assembly was meant to benefit the champion and the reputation of the Hidden Sword Pavilion. But the Incineration Sword broke in Lin Yun’s hands just like that and not even Feng Xuanzi could stay calm.

“This is a huge joke now…” Ye Feifan grinned.

Luo Hua didn’t say a word while Bai Ting’s hands were covered in sweat because he knew that this was troublesome.

On the stage, Lin Yun wore a bewildered expression for a long time before his lips twitched. He stared at the empty hilt while his heart bled.

Even if Lin Yun didn’t need this sword, he could have exchanged it for many things. He could have even given it to a friend.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun could sense two gazes filled with killing intent directed at him. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw the faces of the two servants. With an awkward smile, Lin Yun put the hilt back into the sword box, “Here, you can have it back.”

“The sword is already broken. What do you mean by returning the sword hilt!” The two servants barked.

Right at this moment, Feng Xuanzi’s face turned pale, and threw out a mouthful of blood before he collapsed on his seat with his voice trembling, “M-M-My sword…”

“Big Brother!”

“Pavilion Master!” Everyone from the Feng Clan was shocked by this scene as they quickly crowded over. Meanwhile, the representatives from the other clans were impressed by the fact that Lin Yun made a heavenly spiritualist throw up blood. After all, Feng Xuanzi was comparable to a quasi-saint and not even a saint dared to offend him.

Feng Xuanzi’s face alternated between white and green on the stage as he smiled, “Jian Jingtian, you really found a good disciple. Good! Good! Very good!”

His finger was trembling when he pointed at Lin Yun, but Lin Yun had no idea who Jian Jingtian was. He wondered if Feng Xuanzi was talking about the old geezer. If that was the case, then it was really a misunderstanding because he had a bad relationship with the old geezer. It was just pure coincidence that the Incineration Sword broke.

Lin Yun knew about his peculiar physique, but he didn’t want to reveal it. Plus, Feng Xuanzi was the one who demanded Lin Yun to test the sword in public. How could he have turned down the request?

“Send him off!” Feng Xuanzi roared with his face dark. His voice was rumbling and shocked everyone.

After all, everyone knew that Feng Xuanzi was someone who wouldn’t get angered easily even if Feng Xiaoyu and Feng Xingyang were both slapped by Lin Yun. So they were shocked to see that Feng Xuanzi was so angered because they had never seen him lose his temper in this manner.

But thinking about it again, it made sense because no one could maintain their composure if they were in his position.

Lin Yun was also shocked by Feng Xuanzi’s sudden change of attitude. I’m a victim! The sword belonged to him and it was Feng Xuanzi who forced him to test the sword. But Lin Yun gave up with a sigh and didn’t utter a single word.

“Why are you still here? The Hidden Sword Pavilion doesn’t welcome you. You’re here to cause trouble!” The Grand Elder of the Feng Clan roared when he looked at Lin Yun.

“This is only a misunderstanding,” said Lin Yun.

“Hmph. Don’t blame us for being impolite if you won’t leave!” The Grand Elder was unhappy with Lin Yun. After all, he didn’t even want to give Lin Yun the Incineration Sword. In his mind, Lin Yun broke the sword to publicly humiliate the Feng Clan.

Lin Yun had rage flashing through his pupils but he ultimately bore it down. He wanted to leave, but he didn’t have a choice since he made a promise to the old geezer. Lin Yun was sorry that the sword broke, but he wasn’t at fault since it couldn’t be controlled.

“Senior, please hold your steps.” Lin Yun ignored the Grand Elder and looked at Feng Xuanzi who was leaving.

Feng Xuanzi stopped when he heard Lin Yun’s words and turned around with a mocking expression, “What is it? You want me to forge another sword so that you can break it again to slap my face publicly?”

“No need for that,” replied Lin Yun.

“Then why aren’t you leaving? Are you waiting to be killed? I won’t make a move against you since you’re a junior, but I won’t mind if anyone kills you after I leave. In the future, you better not show up in this city,” said Feng Xuanzi coldly.

When Lin Yun looked around, he could sense the malicious gazes from the surrounding elders of the Feng Clan. He now knew why Feng Xiaoyu was so unreasonable, she had unreasonable elders.

The breaking of the Incineration Sword had nothing to do with them because the sword belonged to him, and it was none of their business no matter how he played with it. At this moment, Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered to be polite anymore and replied, “Don’t worry. I won’t come back to this city again, but this matter hasn’t come to an end!”

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Feng Xuanzi’s face became colder, “Not done yet? Why don’t you tell me what you’re not done with? Let us hear what business you still have. If you don’t give me an explanation today, I don’t mind teaching you a lesson on behalf of Jian Jingtian!”

The entire plaza became colder when Feng Xuanzi said those words, causing everyone to look at Lin Yun with mockery. If Lin Yun didn’t give an explanation, then the entire Feng Clan wouldn’t let him go.

On the platform, Gong Haoran smiled coldly, “Who does he think he is? Does he think that the Feng Clan are all pushovers?”

Everyone from the Feng Clan turned to look at Lin Yun with malicious gazes. They were unhappy with him and would have dealt with him if it weren’t for Feng Xuanzi. In the end, Lin Yun was merely a Heavenly Soul Realm.

Feng Xiaoyu also sneered because Lin Yun had enraged his grandfather. There was no one that could save Lin Yun.

Under the strange looks, Lin Yun took a deep breath and said, “Junior Lin Yun, is here under the sect master’s orders to retrieve the Lightning Shadow Sword.”

His words were like a bomb that made all of the geniuses look at him like he was mad. At the same time, the Grand Elder of the Feng Clan cursed when he heard what Lin Yun said, “You bastard! You still say that you’re not here to cause trouble?!”

Feng Xuanzi calmed his younger brother before he said with a cold face, “I didn’t hear it clearly. Why don’t you repeat it again?”

Hearing the threat, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly, and he no longer restrained his temper. Raising his brow, Lin Yun poured out rage into his voice, “Junior Lin Yun is here under the sect master’s orders to retrieve the Lightning Shadow Sword.”
