Chapter 283 - You're not Qualified!

Chen Ling smiled bitterly. This was the first time he was being disregarded. He wasn’t just being humiliated, but completely disregarded. A moment ago, he took the initiative to offer 30% to Lin Yun, but he didn’t realize that he still held onto the pride of being number forty-eight on the Mortal Ranking when he said those words.

He really had no idea that he was speaking in an aloof manner. It was as if he was performing charity by offering 30% to Lin Yun. He had no idea that he was courting death in this manner.

He was only forty-eighth on the Mortal Ranking. Even Zhang Lie, who was tenth on the Mortal Ranking, had to kneel obediently before Lin Yun. So where did Chen Ling get the confidence to manage Lin Yun?

“Are you sure you know now?” asked Lin Yun coldly. At the same time, an immense pressure crashed down on Chen Ling, which made him tremble.

“I really do.” The last layer of defense in Chen Ling’s heart collapsed and he no longer put on any airs before Lin Yun.

“Then I’ll join your Shatterlegion Alliance for the time being. Now, tell me more about the Imperial Sword Herb.” Lin Yun nodded his head for Chen Ling to speak.

Chen Ling felt relieved and he even had joy written on his face when he heard that Lin Yun was willing to temporarily join the Shatterlegion Alliance. He replied, “Great! With Boss Zhong joining us, the Imperial Sword Herb is practically in the bag!”

The two then began to discuss the Imperial Sword Herb. A brief moment later, Lin Yun was fully educated on the Imperial Sword Herb. There were designated locations where the Imperial Sword Herb would be born. Those locations might be mysterious, but there were many of them. After all, the Burial Sword Peak was one of the four great lands in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. So no matter how mysterious they were, there were some traces to be found.

Knowing was one thing, but being able to retrieve it was another. Demonic beasts would be alerted by the birth of the Imperial Sword Herb, so retrieving one was troublesome. The Shatterlegion Alliance knew about this secret before the Alliance-Union Battle and they had allied themselves with two other alliance-unions.

“We’re all randomly transported, so how do you find each other in the Burial Sword Peak? Can it be that there’s a map?” asked Lin Yun.

“There’s indeed a map.” Chen Ling took out a map from his interspatial pouch.

Lin Yun grabbed it and looked at the various symbols marked on the map. The undiscovered regions were marked black and the designated locations for the Imperial Sword Herb were marked with a sword symbol.

The Imperial Sword Herb was one of the more precious herbs found in the Burial Sword Peak and they provided a better effect when consumed with the Swordcloud Core. Because of this, the Imperial Sword Herb surpassed the value of most treasures that were marked on the map. It was an extremely tempting treasure for everyone.

Lin Yun memorized the map quietly. Looking at the map bitterly, Chen Ling asked, “Boss Zhong, what should we do now?”

“Let’s stick to the plan. You’re the leader of the Shatterlegion Alliance and I’m only a member,” replied Lin Yun, without any expression on his face.

“Okay, let’s go.” Chen Ling nodded his head and sheathed his sword before explaining his arrangement with Lin Yun to the other four disciples. The four were briefly surprised before they continued on their journey to meet up with the Will-o'-Wisp Alliance and Flamemoon Alliance.

Along the way, they encountered another demonic beast that possessed a Swordcloud Core, but Lin Yun didn’t make a move to take it. Although he didn’t make a move, he was decisive when it came to killing. Even if he encountered sixth stage demonic beasts, he could easily kill them without any injuries.

He didn’t even need to use the sword in his sword box. He was only using his physical strength and punches, which left the five from the Shatterlegion Alliance dumbfounded. They couldn’t imagine that there would be a monster like Lin Yun in the outer sect. They even speculated that his strength wasn’t any weaker than those in the top ten.

While the Shatterlegion Alliance was traveling, a figure descended before them without any warning. His appearance made Chen Ling’s face change. Chen Ling immediately went up and talked to that person in a soft tone. That person swept a few glances at Lin Yun, while Chen Ling tried to explain something. After a few moments, that mysterious figure left.

“Senior Brother, who was that person?” The four from the Shatterlegion Alliance asked Chen Ling. They were curious about that person’s identity.

“He’s from the Gentlemen Union. With Chu Haoyu joining the Gentlemen Union, no one dares to offend them in the Burial Sword Peak,” smiled Chen Ling.

“Why did the Gentlemen Union come?” asked Lin Yun.

“Boss Zhong, you must be unaware of it because you’ve been outside the sect throughout the years. The Sword Firmament Pavilion recently had a monster that embarrassed everyone in the top ten on the Mortal Ranking. So the Gentlemen Union is taking the lead in this Alliance-Union Battle to hunt for him,” explained Chen Ling.

“The various alliance-unions even put out an offer of 50 second-grade spiritual jades to anyone who discovers Lin Yun’s tracks. There will be an additional 100 spiritual-jades to those who can hold him back. As for anyone who’s able to injure him, the reward is 200 second-grade spiritual jades.”

“What a huge price. It’s too extravagant to take out second-grade spiritual jades as a reward,” sighed the four disciples.

“The reward is being offered by the eldest direct descendant of the Wang Clan. This Lin Yun is probably doomed this time. But let’s not dip our hands in this mess. There’s no need for us to provoke Lin Yun. But…” Chen Ling turned to look at Lin Yun, and he smiled, “There’s nothing Boss Zhong has to fear if you run into him. You’re fully capable of holding him back with your strength. In fact, you might even be able to injure him.”

“I’m not interested,” replied Lin Yun. Now he knew why many people were paying attention to him when he entered the Burial Sword Peak. They must have been reporting his location like little rats. At this moment, he felt lucky to have the mask. Otherwise, he would be dragged down by this giant mess.

Three days later, the Shatterlegion Alliance met up with the Will-o'-Wisp Alliance and Flamemoon Alliance. When they saw the leaders of the two alliance-unions, Lin Yun finally understood why Chen Ling wanted him to temporarily join the Shatterlegion Alliance.

The one leading the Will-o'-Wisp Alliance was a rare beauty named Lin Qiushan. She was ranked thirty-ninth on the Mortal Ranking. As for the one leading the Flamemoon Alliance, it was Gu Beixuan, who was ranked thirty-sixth on the Mortal Ranking. They were both stronger than Chen Ling.

In this alliance, the Shatterlegion Alliance probably didn’t have any authority of speech. But Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan weren’t around right now. The two had discovered a demonic beast with a Swordcloud Core and they had gone hunting for it.

Chen Ling felt relieved and turned to the second-in-charge of the two alliance-unions. He smiled and said, “Sorry to keep you guys waiting.”

The Flamemoon Alliance’s second-in-charge was Tian Fei. But he didn’t have much respect in his tone for Chen Ling and he faintly replied, “It’s alright. We didn’t wait for long.”

“Who’s he?” A lady in the Will-o'-Wisp Alliance looked at Lin Yun. She spoke out, “There are only five people participating from the Shatterlegion Alliance, so I don’t remember someone like him around.”

The mask that Lin Yun was wearing looked horrifying, which made him stand out. So it was hard for anyone not to notice him. However, the rest were concerned about Chen Ling’s face and didn’t question it aloud. But the lady who spoke was Lin Qiushan’s younger sister, Lin Yan. She had always done whatever she liked and disregarded everyone.

Chen Ling started to sweat in his heart. He was worried that Zhong Yunxiao would teach her a lesson, so he immediately spoke out, “Junior Sister Lin, this is Zhong Yunxiao. He’s someone we met along the way and joined the Shatterlegion Alliance upon my invitation to participate in this mission.”

“Zhong Yunxiao? Senior Brother Tian, is there such a figure like him amongst the top hundred?” Lin Yan examined Lin Yun. She was unhappy with how Lin Yun covered his appearance with a mask.

Tian Fei’s eyes flashed with a playful gaze. He examined Lin Yun before he smiled, “Not only have I never heard this name in the top one hundred, but I’ve never even heard of this name in the top five hundred. Zhong Yunxiao? When did the Sword Firmament Pavilion have such a person?”

When Lin Yan heard those words, she burst into laughter, “So he’s a nobody? Chen Ling, you’re at least ranked forty-eighth on the Mortal Ranking. Why are you bringing along a nobody to join us? Did you forget to take medication for your mental illness?”

How noisy! Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a wisp of rage beneath the mask.

Chen Ling could clearly sense Lin Yun’s rage. He immediately smiled, “Junior Sister Lin, we’ve already said that we will distribute the Imperial Sword Herb based on how much we contribute. We’ve said nothing about not getting a helper. Can’t you give me some face?”

Lin Yan directly disregarded his words and coldly replied, “Let’s remove his mask first. What is he trying to do by wearing a mask? Pretending to be cool? He’s the type of person I hate the most.”

“I’m afraid you’re not qualified to get me to remove my mask.” Lin Yun’s indifferent voice rang out from beneath the mask.

Lin Yan’s face immediately sank as a murderous aura flickered through her eyes. She spoke out coldly, “Chen Ling, this friend of yours must be courting death, right?”

Chen Ling was feeling bitter in his heart. Yeah, someone is courting death. However, it’s not Zhong Yunxiao, but you, Lin Yan.

“It just so happens that I insist on removing your mask today!” Lin Yan snorted and reached for Lin Yun’s mask. However, Lin Yun easily avoided her. Seeing that she missed, Lin Yan immediately flew into a rage and roared, “A nobody like you dares to dodge? Behave yourself!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Her origin energy fluctuated and she made her move again. But Lin Yun merely folded his arms together. He wasn’t even interested in retaliating, but merely looked at her with indifference.

“Damn it! I’ll kill you!” Lin Yan lost it and wanted to draw her sword. Chen Ling immediately panicked. His face was turning pale. It was fine if she tried to grab Lin Yun’s mask, but it was a whole different matter if she drew her sword. Lin Yun would have a reason to kill her now.

She drew her sword out by half an inch, which made Lin Yun frown his eyebrows beneath the mask. Then, he executed the Seven Profound Steps. He took a step out and suddenly appeared before Lin Yan. Before she could even respond, he gave her a slap that sent her flying away.

With the resounding slap, Lin Yan flew away. This scene had shocked everyone. The disciples of the Will-o'-Wisp Alliance drastically changed their faces. They immediately stepped forward to catch the flying Lin Yan.

Tian Fei was also briefly stunned before he started rejoicing in his heart because Lin Yun was too bold. He was just troubled about finding a reason to get close to Lin Yan and Lin Yun had given him one.

“You bastard, you must be courting death to dare to touch Lady Lin!” Tian Fei leaped forward and threw a punch at Lin Yun. Most swordsmen would practice palm or fist techniques. After all, they would engage in close-combat often. Sometimes, there was no need for them to draw their swords.

The fist technique that Tian Fei was using was the famous Flamepeak Fist of the Sword Firmament Pavilion. When he threw his punch, it was accompanied by flames that descended like a fiery mountain.

“Bravo!” The Flamemoon Alliance’s disciples cheered when they saw that. Chen Ling covered his face because he didn’t even have to see to know what the outcome would be.

Facing the Flamepeak Fist, Lin Yun merely threw a casual punch in retaliation. When his fist collided with Tian Fei’s punch, the latter was blown away, spitting up blood as his fist was shattered. But before he could fly away, Lin Yun suddenly changed from a fist to a grab.

“NO!” Tian Fei yelled out in panic. Before he could even react, he was slammed onto the ground by Lin Yun and threw up yet another mouthful of blood.

With a gentle stomp, Lin Yun buried Tian Fei’s head deep into the ground. Tian Fei was struggling with his legs, but it was futile. No matter what he did, he couldn’t escape. Lin Yun merely glanced at Lin Yan before he spoke out, “I’ve already said that you’re not qualified!”

Lin Yan’s face was swollen from the slap. She looked at Lin Yun’s cold gaze beneath the mask and trembled as fear rose from her heart. She knew that she had bumped into a monster.

“What’s going on?” Asked a gentle voice while everyone stood in shock. The voice belonged to Lin Qiushan, who returned with Gu Beixuan after killing the demonic beast.
