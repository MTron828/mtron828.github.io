Chapter 1768 – Martial Dao Tea Party

After bidding farewell to Mu Xueling, Lin Yun left the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s Island. Before leaving, he briefly pondered before going back with the Divine Azure Overlord Physique and entrusting someone with returning it to Jiang Yingtian.

When the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master saw the jade slip, he furrowed his brows and was puzzled. Shaking his head, he said, “This is the Divine Azure Overlord Physique, and he actually refused it? How will he fight those from the other Azure Dragon’s lineage branches?”

He couldn’t probe what Lin Yun was thinking; perhaps only his father could. He just hoped that his father’s decision was right.

Four years have passed within the Three-Lives Realm, but it was only seven days in the outside world. Over the past seven days, the news about Lin Yun becoming first on the Nirvana Banquet and defeating Mei Zihua, as well as the commotion about the Black Tortoise Void Ocean and the Martial Dao Tea Party, spread throughout Heavenly Domain City.

While walking on the streets, Lin Yun could hear something related to him from time to time. He was also surprised because he didn’t think that becoming first on the Nirvana Banquet would cause such a huge commotion.

Being too famous now wasn’t exactly a good thing for him, but they discussed more about the Martial Dao Tea Party instead.

The Three-Lives Fruit that Saint Elder told him to consume was estimated to be a year, but she made a mistake, and he stayed in the Three-Lives Realm for four years instead. Going by this trend, the remaining Three-Lives Fruit should be able to give him ten years.

If he ran into a similar situation in the future, it would be easier to handle, and he wouldn’t be placed in a situation like he is now. He might benefit significantly from the Three-Lives Realm, but he was also in trouble at the same time.

Saint Elder could see through his cultivation with a glance, which made him cautious. Thus, he immediately used the Divine Tortoise Transformation to conceal his aura when he left the island. Suddenly, a familiar melody resounded, containing a wisp of sorrow.

The sorrowful melody was contagious, so Lin Yun followed the melody. He initially planned to visit An Liuyan, in the Heavenly Star Pavilion, to find out Mei Zihua’s location. But he didn’t need to do that now, he just had to follow the melody.

Half a stick of incense later, he saw Mei Zihua playing the erhu by the roadside. If he had a bowl before him, he would have touched the essence of erhu.

He was decent with it, and a crowd surrounded him. Lin Yun was low profile and found a corner to sit down.

When Mei Zihua was done with the song, it took a long time for the crowd to disperse. After Mei Zihua stowed the erhu, he was excited when he saw Lin Yun’s existence upon raising his head.

As Lin Yun got up and walked over, he said, “It looks like I don’t have to teach you how to play it now.”

“Seven days have passed, and even a pig will figure something out. Not to mention I’m Mei Zihua.” Mei Zihua looked proud, handing the erhu to Lin Yun. He said, “Great instrument. If this didn’t belong to Saint Elder, I would really want to buy it off your hands.”

“You’re terrified of Saint Elder?” Lin Yun casually asked as he received the erhu. He noticed before that Mei Zihua’s respect for Mu Xueling far surpassed his respect towards the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master.

Mei Zihua was briefly surprised by Lin Yun’s question before he smiled, “Let’s go and have a drink.”

The Thunderstorm Inn was the biggest inn within Heavenly Domain City’s Vermillion Bird District. It had nine floors; each level was more spacious than a manor, and it could hold many people. Disciples and descendants of prestigious backgrounds also frequented this place.

The spending on each floor would increase from the first floor to the ninth floor, the expenditures on each floor would increase, and those on the ninth floor even needed a prestigious identity—someone like Mei Zihua was naturally brought to the ninth floor.

They saw several youths giving a grand speech when they reached the ninth floor.

“I heard another phenomenon appeared on the Black Tortoise Void Sea. A black pillar soared to the sky and broke the third layer of heaven.”

“There have always been rumors that the Black Tortoise inheritance could be found in the Black Tortoise Void Sea. Judging from the current commotion, the inheritance might really appear.”

“The Martial Dao Tea Party is coincidentally going to be held when there is a commotion in the Black Tortoise Void Sea. The top ten on the Dragon Pulse Rankings will be there. The past tea parties were pretty pointless because Jian Jingtian had always occupied the first rank on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, with everyone suppressed by him. But this tea party will be different.”

“That’s right. Jian Jingtian has left the Dragon Pulse Realm after so long, so it’s time for a new champion of the Dragon Pulse Ranking to be decided!”

Lin Yun and Mei Zihua naturally heard their conversation while sitting near the window. Lin Yun asked, “The Martial Dao Tea Party?”

He had heard about it along the way but wasn’t too bothered. But he never expected that it would be such a popular topic.

“This is the event that I mentioned before. The Four Young Masters of Heavenly Domain City will take turns holding the Martial Dao Tea Party. It’s held once every two years and will be held by the Autumn Mountain Lord this time.” Mei Zihua smiled.

The Four Young Masters of Heavenly Domain City were the Wind Edge Lord, Snow Master Lord, Autumn Mountain Lord, and the Blue Frost Lord. They each have a title and nobility status bestowed by the Divine Dragon Empire. This was a treatment that only outstanding geniuses could receive, and their clans also received a title from the Divine Dragon Empire.

To a certain degree, the four titled clans of Heavenly Domain City represented the Divine Dragon Empire. Lin Yun met the Wind Edge Lord before, and their meeting didn’t have a pleasant ending. The Wind Edge Lord was strong, and it was practically impossible for Lin Yun to defeat him through normal means when he was at the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. As for the other three of the Four Young Masters, they probably wouldn’t be any weaker, either.

“Since it’s held every two years, what’s the difference this year?” Lin Yun asked softly.

“Those people already made it clear. It’s a gathering where everyone fights to be ranked on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. But everyone can only be ranked beneath Jian Jingtian, no matter how they fought in the past, and no one is foolish enough to challenge Jian Jingtian in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. This is why the previous Martial Dao Tea Parties were pointless.” Mei Zihua smiled.

“First on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. Won’t it be on the Dragon Pulse Ranking? Why do they have to compete in the Martial Dao Tea Party?” Lin Yun asked.

Placing his cup down, Mei Zihua said, “The Dragon Pulse Ranking is only a rough ranking, and no one will be convinced without a real fight. In the past, Jian Jingtian was publicly known to be the first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. But he left the Dragon Pulse Realm now. So not only do the Four Young Masters of Heavenly Domain City want to obtain first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, the six holy lands’ geniuses do as well.

“Not to mention Jian Jingtian forged his name through countless battles and not just based on rankings. So the top ten on the Dragon Pulse Ranking are waiting for an opportunity to become famous through a fight, just like how Jian Jingtian established his position on the Dragon Pulse Ranking back then!” Mei Zihua briefly paused before he continued, “This is an opportunity. Due to the Black Tortoise Void Sea commotion, the top ten on the Dragon Pulse Ranking are here. But they couldn’t go to the Black Tortoise Void Sea because of the danger for the time being, which made this Martial Dao Tea Party more interesting.”

Lin Yun listened and only felt that his senior brother’s experience was a legend. After leaving the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, Lin Yun would occasionally hear legends regarding his senior brother in the Eastern Desolation. Even someone like Saint Elder had heard of his senior brother’s reputation. But the Martial Dao Tea Party was also related to his senior brother this time.

This Martial Dao Tea Party would be pointless if his senior brother was still at the Dragon Pulse Realm. As the junior brother, he was a little lacking when compared to his senior brother.

Mei Zihua had no idea what Lin Yun was thinking. Because he didn’t speak, Mei Zihua thought Lin Yun wasn’t too bothered. He smiled, “What’s the matter? Are you not interested in the Dragon Pulse Ranking? Your cultivation might be lacking now, but when everyone else in the current ranking makes a breakthrough to the Samsara Edict Realm, you’ll have a good chance to compete for first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking!”

“What are the benefits of becoming first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking?” Lin Yun asked. He also obtained first on the Empyrean and Elysium Core Rankings. Aside from significantly boosting his cultivation, he has not seen other benefits. So he naturally didn’t have much interest in it.

“The Dragon Pulse Ranking can be considered a weakened version of the Blue Dragon Record, and those with their names on it will be blessed with fortune. Fortune is invisible, but everyone knows that it really exists.” Mei Zihua smiled. “Those in the top ten of the Dragon Pulse Ranking would be blessed with great fortune. The Empyrean, Elysium Core, and Dragon Pulse Rankings. The higher the ranking, the stronger the fortune one would receive, and this has always been the case since ancient times.”

Lin Yun pondered over what Mei Zihua said and knew that what the latter said was right.

“Let’s not talk about anyone else and use Flower Burial as an example. Why do you think he can become famous at the Ancient Barren Battlefield and shake the entire Eastern Desolation? Aside from his talent and hard work, it’s hard to say it’s not related to being first on the Empyrean and Elysium Core Rankings.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling a little nervous when Mei Zihua talked about him, and he gulped down the wine in his cup to conceal his anxiety.

“Furthermore, who doesn’t want to become first even if nothing exists? Everyone in the Divine Dragon Era aims to be like a dragon, and who’s willing to be second?” Mei Zihua said passionately, and he didn’t notice Lin Yun’s strange reaction.

“It’s hard to imagine these words coming from you.” Lin Yun said in surprise.

With a smile, Mei Zihua replied, “That’s because you don’t understand me well. By the way, did you look at the jade slip I gave you?”

What jade slip? Lin Yun was briefly taken aback before he figured out what Mei Zihua was saying. It should be the jade slip that had Mei Zihua’s finger technique recorded in it, along with his comprehension of music dao.

Lin Yun had yet to take a look at it. He spent the majority of the four years refining the Divine Azure Blood and the remaining time practicing swordsmanship. So he naturally forgot about the jade slip given to him by Mei Zihua.

But seeing Mei Zihua’s earnest expression, Lin Yun was embarrassed to tell him the truth and replied, “I did.”

“How is it?” Mei Zihua’s eyes shone brightly with anticipation.

“I can only say that you’re befitting of your title as Saint Hands.” Lin Yun answered.

Mei Zihua was overjoyed when he heard what Lin Yun said, and he smiled, “It’s still alright. It only contains some of my insights, and they’re insignificant.”

Knowing that he would reveal himself if he talked too much about it, Lin Yun quickly changed the topic, “You have yet to tell me why you’re so afraid of Saint Elder.”

“About that…” Mei Zihua looked around, and he said, “This isn’t a place to talk about it. I’ll transmit my voice to you.”

As he spoke, his lips moved, and his voice was directly transmitted into Lin Yun’s ears.

“If my speculation is right, the Blue Dragon Record is in her hands. Of course, this is only a speculation.” This matter was of great importance, and Mei Zihua didn’t dare to ramble about it, despite only being speculation. Through his voice transmission, only Lin Yun could hear him.

This was really unexpected, and Lin Yun couldn’t conceal the shock in his eyes. The Blue Dragon Record was the supreme divine artifact of the Divine Dragon Empire and yet it was in Saint Elder’s hands.

It may only be a guess from Mei Zihua, but combined with the information Lin Yun had gotten so far, that should be the truth.

Right then, several figures appeared on the ninth floor of the Thunderstorm Inn. Just when Lin Yun was about to speak, he was stunned upon seeing the person leading the party, Ye Ziling.

Aside from that, those around her were his friends from the Sword Sect and fellow disciples who experienced life and death together in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Lin Yun nearly lost control of his emotions and wanted to reunite with them before asking about the situation of his master, sect master, and everyone else.

This surprised Mei Zihua, and he slowly turned to where Lin Yun’s gaze was directed.
