Chapter 2036 - One Sword (2)

The fight between Lin Yun and the white-clothed swordsman was fast. They both executed the first section of the Divine Firefly Sword, and their attacks were ruthless. Their sword techniques were evenly matched, but the white-clothed swordsman’s sword intent was purer than Lin Yun’s, not to mention that the white-clothed swordsman was further empowered by the sword ray left behind by the Emperor Sword.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As a result, the white-clothed swordsman’s attack could achieve the effects of saint aura, containing strong lethality. The white-clothed swordsman was equivalent to a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase, not to mention this person has even grasped Astral Sword Intent and the Divine Firefly Sword simultaneously.

Lin Yun carefully fended off the incoming attacks, knowing how terrifying they were when a Quasi-Saint grasped Astral Sword Intent.

The bearded youth sat on a boulder and smiled with his eyes squinted, “To challenge the ninth level while at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage, let me see how capable you are!”

Ten-odd moves later, Lin Yun fell into a disadvantageous position, and his arms nearly became numb. But Lin Yun didn’t give up. He took a deep breath and released his constellation. When the Kunpeng painting appeared, it manifested into a hundred-foot figure behind him.

Under the empowerment of his constellation, the aura Lin Yun gave off began to rise and soon reached the same level as the white-clothed swordsman.

“Oh?” The bearded youth’s eyes lit up when he saw this scene. He initially thought that Ye Qingtian would lose, so this scene piqued his interest.

“Kunpeng, a primordial ominous beast. This is interesting… but it doesn’t seem to be complete?” The bearded youth might look crude and tattered, but he had a meticulous heart, and he naturally noticed something as he observed Ye Qingtian’s constellation.

The Kunpeng Constellation might seem powerful, but it gave him a feeling that Ye Qingtian was holding back and hadn’t fully unleashed the power of his constellation.

“Dual constellations?” The bearded youth’s interest was further piqued because this was rare.

Lin Yun and the white-clothed swordsman fought even more ferociously, exchanging close to a hundred moves in the blink of an eye, swinging their swords.

The two swords reached each other’s chests, but the white-clothed swordsman was stronger because of his saint aura. So Lin Yun was sent flying instead, throwing out a mouthful of blood with his face becoming pale.

“You lost. You have two opportunities left,” the white-clothed swordsman said indifferently before he turned around and entered the painting.

Lin Yun lowered his head to look at the injury on his chest before letting out a bitter smile. He knew that the white-clothed swordsman had gone easy on him.

If the white-clothed swordsman exerted his full power with Astral Sword Intent, empowered by his saint aura, the white-clothed swordsman’s sword could have easily pierced through his chest. Lin Yun knew it was because he was much weaker than the white-clothed swordsman. He was taking a bet that his sword was faster, but it turned out the white-clothed swordsman’s speed wasn’t inferior to his.

But Lin Yun wasn’t upset because this was within his expectations. He still had a lot of trump cards he didn’t use. He sat down to treat his injuries then opened his eyes fifteen minutes later, with most of his injuries recovered.

“The saint aura is really troublesome to deal with,” Lin Yun said. Although he had recovered from his injuries, the white-clothed swordsman’s saint aura remained within his body. But that wasn’t the most troublesome factor. The saint aura contained a strand of Astral Sword Intent.

So Lin Yun had to find a way to expel it from his body. He had two ways: getting the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron to devour it or using the nether energy of his Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to slowly corrode the saint aura.

“That’s for sure. The Quasi-Saint Realm is equivalent to stepping onto the saint path, even if one hasn’t grasped saint dao. This is why saint aura can easily crush nirvana aura. After all, how could a saint and mortal be placed on the same level?” The bearded youth smiled.

But Lin Yun ignored the bearded youth since everyone knew that. It was equivalent to him spouting nonsense.

“But you’re not bad yourself. After watching your fight, I now believe you can slay a Quasi-Saint. In Six Holy City, you must’ve used your attainment in the sword to avoid the Quasi-Saint’s saint aura before using your nirvana aura to suppress your enemy and used your Astral Sword Intent as a trump card, catching your opponent by surprise and breaking his saint aura!” The bearded youth smiled. “So, am I right?”

Lin Yun nodded, not denying what the bearded youth said.

“But this trial is different because your opponent also possesses the Astral Sword Intent, and your opponent’s attainment in the sword isn’t inferior to you. The Emperor Sword further empowers it and could release saint aura. Hence, you can’t suppress your opponent with your sword aura, and your disadvantage is shown,” the bearded youth said, pointing out Lin Yun’s flaws.

Suddenly, the bearded youth flicked his finger and released a light ray from it.

There was no change on Lin Yun’s face when he saw that. The power contained in that light ray was powerful, but Lin Yun couldn’t sense any murderous intent. So this instantly made Lin Yun wonder what the bearded youth was trying to do.

While Lin Yun was in deep thought, the light ray struck Lin Yun’s back and forced the saint aura within his body out.

This immediately made Lin Yun feel relieved. He turned around and said, “Thank you for your help, Senior Bbrother.”

“No need to thank me,” the bearded youth smiled. “I still want to see you suffer some losses. It’s more interesting this way. After all, I made a great effort through this trial. So it would be boring if you lost too easily.”

Lin Yun stood up and sent a deep look at the bearded youth.

“You’re angry?” The bearded youth smiled, “It’s futile, even if you’re angry. You need strength to back it up. I might’ve suffered at this trial in the past, but I ultimately made it through using three swords. Three swords, no more and no less.”

The bearded youth was conceited, despite his tattered appearance. His pupils were shining brightly, with his pride reflected in them. But his smile soon disappeared when he saw Ye Qingtian stepping forth to challenge again. This time, Lin Yun brought out his Azure Dragon Sword Heart to suppress the white-clothed swordsman before using one sword to cut the white-clothed swordsman into two.

After Lin Yun sheathed his sword, he merely turned around to chuckle at the bearded youth before continuing.

This naturally left the bearded youth dumbfounded because Ye Qingtian only used a sword. He was certain his eyes didn’t mess with him. Ye Qingtian made it through this trial using only one sword.

This was because Lin Yun held back since there was an outsider here. But Lin Yun gave up on concealing his strength after seeing the bearded youth being so cocky.
