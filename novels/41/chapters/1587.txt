Chapter 1588 - Trump Cards!

The Heavenly Profound Tortoise’s killing aura was heavy, and anyone could sense that it was so furious that it was enveloped in a crimson aura. Even if its voice was eerie, anyone could hear the tenderness in its tone, like a child pretending to be an adult. This further proved that this Heavenly Profound Tortoise was in its infancy stage. Otherwise, the demonic cultivators here wouldn’t dare to provoke it.

“Get lost from my Cold Pond, or all of you will die here!” The Heavenly Profound Tortoise roared, unleashing a terrifying chill that felt like a raging blizzard. The blizzard was dreadful, with wind similar to blades and snow as sharp as swords, tearing apart everything in its path, including the sky.

Even if it was only at the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, the Heavenly Profound Tortoise was powerful thanks to its divine beast’s bloodline. In addition to its tortoise shell, numbers couldn’t pose any threat to it.

“Haha, don’t tell me that you guys will run now, right?” Jiang Tong sneered. “I believe you all know how terrifying the third-pulse tribulation is. We’ve been stuck at the pinnacle third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm for at least a year, and we wouldn’t have come to the Withered Mountain Range if we had other methods. So aren’t you guys a little too cowardly before this baby tortoise? I suggest that we join hands and deal with it together.”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He had belittled this Heavenly Profound Tortoise at the beginning. But after witnessing it personally, he immediately became afraid. It was hard for him to unleash his full strength when facing the Heavenly Profound Tortoise’s aura. He knew that it would be even more complicated when the fight began. So if they didn’t join hands, they might lose their lives here, not to mention retrieving the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood.

“Let’s join forces. We’ll rely on our capability to snatch the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood. Every single part of this tortoise is a treasure. Even if we can’t get the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood, we won’t return empty-handed!” Qin Can said indifferently. He had a hoarse voice, giving off a bloodlusty aura as he spoke.

As a genius who once belonged to the Heavenly Blade Pavilion, he gave off a cold-blooded aura and instantly attracted much attention when he spoke. More importantly, he had a high position amongst everyone there because he took a demonic path expert as his master.

“I have no opinion against it!” Chang Yu smiled. He used to be the strongest genius from the Emerald Jade Manor. Swiftly after he left, he quickly rose through the ranks, and it was also said that he stole a sacred item from the Emerald Jade Manor.

Only the Dragon Reversal Valley’s Yan Jiao kept silent, but his opinion no longer mattered since the three rising stars had decided to join forces. This meant that he had no choice but to join hands with them.

“Let’s go!” Qin Can said, making the first move. He unleashed a dazzling blade ray at the Heavenly Profound Tortoise. His blade ray swiftly flew out before landing on the Heavenly Profound Tortoise’s shell, shattering quite a few saint runes on the shell.

“What a fast blade!” Lin Yun’s expression became grave, sensing that blade ray's terrifying sharpness. It was no wonder why that Qin Can could make it on the Demonic Ranking.

“You guys are courting death!” The Heavenly Profound Tortoise lost it and breathed a water geyser from its mouth. The water geyser contained a terrifying chill, and it had frozen the phenomenon released by Qin Can before it was fully unleashed.

Qin Can took the blow head-on and was frozen in mid-air before the power of his blade ray could be fully unleashed. Facing the terrifying chill, Qin Can was forced to retreat after three dragons appeared behind him and shattered the ice covering him.

When the fight broke out, the other rising stars also charged over, unleashing terrifying waves of attacks towards the Heavenly Profound Tortoise.

“It’s time for us to make our move, as well.” Jiang Tong squinted his eyes and turned to the bone flute youth beside him. The bone flute youth nodded because he knew they would become everyone’s enemy if they didn’t make a move.

They would be doomed if they were isolated by everyone else, and they would have to face immense pressure.

The Dragon Reversal Valley’s Yan Jiao also made a move. His palm landed on the Heavenly Profound Tortoise’s shell. His fist had manifested into a venomous python, but it only managed to shatter a few saint runes on the tortoise shell. Most importantly, he was injured by the recoil of his attack.

“Damn it!” Yan Jiao cursed, waving his hand.

“What powerful defense!” Jiang Tong and everyone else gradually noticed that something wasn’t right. Their attacks were strong, but they couldn’t do anything to the Heavenly Profound Tortoise because the shell was too tough. The Heavenly Profound Tortoise would shrink back into the tortoise shell whenever they attacked.

The bone flute youth had some effect on the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, but the Heavenly Profound Tortoise’s tail had locked onto him like a python with a triangular head. The tail was swift and poisonous, rendering the bone flute youth helpless.

“Big Brother, that tortoise shell is a treasure!” Lil’ Red’s eyes were shining brightly, looking at the shell, and those words made Lin Yun speechless.

Lin Yun was watching the battle, and he couldn’t smile because the Heavenly Profound Tortoise was too heaven-defying. Those Demonic Ranking’s rising geniuses had already resorted to using ghost spirit martial techniques, but they couldn’t deal any damage to the Heavenly Profound Tortoise.

The cracks on the tortoise shell soon recovered, which was similar to his dragon runes. So this made Lin Yun wonder if that Heavenly Profound Tortoise had an Origin Divine Rune. The more Lin Yun pondered about it, the more possible it seemed to be true.

“Senior Brother, these people are doomed.” Chen Ling suppressed his voice, and his tone was filled with excitement.

“Let’s just watch.” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered.

Heavenly Profound Tortoise threw the trident out as the two spoke, seeing that no one could damage its shell as it hid within it. Then, while the Heavenly Profound Tortoise was within its shell, it flew around like a bolt and slammed against those Demonic Ranking’s rising stars.

The shell was massive, and a gentle bump was enough to make its victims throw out blood. The Demonic Ranking’s rising stars couldn’t do anything to the shell, even after they resorted to summoning their constellations.

But when the Heavenly Profound Tortoise hid within the shell, the bone flute youth started playing the flute again.

“You’re noisy!” The Heavenly Profound Tortoise reached out of the shell, grabbed the trident, and threw it over.

Looking at the trident flying over, the bone flute youth squinted his eyes, and the Heavenly Profound Tortoise spat out cold light just when the bone flute youth wanted to respond. When the cold light exploded, it turned into a mist that enveloped the bone flute youth.

“An opportunity!” Everyone’s eyes lit up upon seeing this and they unleashed their attacks at the Heavenly Profound Tortoise’s head.

But the Heavenly Profound Tortoise soon hid within its shell and Qin Can’s saint blade fell on top of it, causing sparks to fly. As a result, the massive rebound force destroyed the saint runes on the blade, making Qin Can’s face so dark that he nearly threw out a mouthful of blood. Not only did he fail to gain any advantage in his attack, but he was also injured by the rebound force, instead.

“Damn it!”

“That damn tortoise’s shell is too hard!”

“We must find a way. We can’t let this go on any longer!” While everyone was conversing amongst themselves, the shell spun once more, making everyone’s faces change. The Demonic Ranking’s rising stars were fine, but their parties suffered tremendous casualties. Some of them were even torn apart by the sheer force.

“Bring out whatever trump cards you guys have! There’s no need to hide them, anymore!” Jiang Tong said with his face ugly.

“It’s just a mere tortoise!” The face of the Dragon Reversal Valley’s Yan Jiao was ugly as he took out a whip. It was a myriad rune saint artifact. This whip was of lightning and fire attributes, with the core being an acquired Thunderflame Divine Rune with ten thousand other saint runes.

In the hands of a Dragon Pulse Realm, the power of a myriad rune saint artifact was completely different. This was because those in the Elysium Core Realm could only unleash 10% of its power, and after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, one could unleash one-third of its power. But Yan Jiao couldn’t be bothered with that much.

“I can give up on the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood, but I want the shell!” Yan Jiao snickered as he lashed his whip, accompanied by lightning and flames.

“This fellow!” Chang Yu squinted his eyes and inwardly sneered. Who didn’t know that the tortoise shell was a treasure? He no longer held back and took out a stone tablet. This stone tablet was four feet tall, and a talisman was engraved on it. Upon activation, it could summon lightning that could shatter the first and second layers of the thirty-six layers of heaven, appearing to have had summoned a deity.

Jiang Tong squinted his eyes because that stone tablet should be the sacred item that Chang Yu stole from the Emerald Jade Manor, the Lightning Dragon Tablet. It was rumored that a True Dragon’s soul was hidden within it.

On the other side, Qin Can’s eyes also turned red as his blade intent began to rise. In the blink of an eye, his Firmament Blade Intent reached greater mastery and a bloodlusty aura was being emitted from his blade.

The black blade in his hand looked like a demon. This was the Star Devourer Canon taught to him by the demonic path expert. At this moment, none of the Demonic Ranking’s rising stars held back and unleashed their trump cards.
