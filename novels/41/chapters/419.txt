Chapter 420 - Your Highness, I’m Sorry!

Initially, with the elders’ words, the conflict between Lin Yun and Ye Feng could be resolved. However, no one had expected that Ye Feng would push it. Although Ye Feng declared an exchange of one move, the power of a quasi-Violet Palace Realm wasn’t something that someone in the ninth stage could withstand.

This made the elders on the platform frown their brows.

“Should we do something about this?”

“It’s fine if it’s just one move. It’s not a bad thing if Ye Feng can stop Lin Yun from participating in this Dragon Gate Competition.”

“That’s right. Judging from Guardian Plum’s tone, he seems to want Lin Yun to participate in the next one.”

“Yeah, let’s just watch. Ye Feng should know when to stop if he’s just trying to establish his presence.”

The elders were all experienced, so they naturally knew what Ye Feng was trying to do. That’s why they did nothing about it. After all, all cultivators naturally chased after fame and it was especially understandable for Ye Feng since he had just returned.

They were more concerned about Ye Feng’s strength. They could see many things at their level and they could see a unique temperament coming from Ye Feng that was different from other disciples. It was something forged by blood and killing.

Ye Feng wasn’t just an ordinary quasi-Violet Palace Realm, but one with the strength to kill a Violet Palace Realm! All of them had high opinions about Ye Feng.

If you had the strength, the elders would naturally choose to turn a blind eye even if you did anything out of the line. This was what happened when Lin Yun slew Wang Yan.

But just when the two were about to fight, two silhouettes descended on the stage. It was Xin Yan and the princess.

Lin Yun and Ye Feng’s faces both changed when they saw the princess and they retracted their aura. Then, they bowed, “Greetings, Your Highness.”

When Ye Feng bowed, he was rejoicing inwardly because he knew that the princess was present. Aside from establishing his presence today, he was also planning to leave the princess with a deep impression. After all, who wouldn’t try to do this if they had the chance?

A smile rose on Ye Feng’s lips. He thought that he had attracted the princess’ attention, so he smiled, “I wonder if Your Highness has any advice for me?”

“No advice, but your fight with Lin Yun can be called off.”

“Called off?” Lin Yun and Ye Feng were both baffled.

Ye Feng’s expression became awkward. So it turns out that the princess came to the stage for Lin Yun. Was she afraid that he would embarrass Lin Yun? Just thinking about this, Ye Feng couldn’t help feeling enraged in his heart about Lin Yun’s luck.

It looks like the rumors were true that the princess sees Lin Yun in a different light. Since that was the case, then there was no way he could let this matter off. He wanted to embarrass Lin Yun on the stage.

Recovering his expression, Ye Feng smiled, “I naturally don’t dare to go against Your Highness’ words. However, as swordsmen, we can’t go back on our words. I’m afraid that Junior Brother Lin won’t give up either.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Feng was hoping that this scheme would work. After all, it would be different if Lin Yun also agreed to his statement. But just when Lin Yun was about to speak, the princess spoke out without even turning her head around, “You’re forbidden from speaking.”

“Junior Brother, did you hear that? Her Highness has forbidden you from speaking,” smiled Xin Yan.

Lin Yun responded with an awkward smile and he kept his mouth shut.

“I don’t think your actions make sense. If my memory serves me right, you said that Lin Yun isn’t qualified to participate in the Dragon Gate Competition and that you want him to back down from it. But I think that you aren’t qualified to participate in the Dragon Gate Competition. If you don’t believe it, you can exchange a move with me too,” continued Bloomphoenix Princess.

Her words made Ye Feng dumbfounded because there was no issue in her logic. The princess’ strength was secondary. After all, he didn’t dare to fight with the princess, even if he had more guts. The princess was clearly trying to protect Lin Yun by pushing him into a dead-end.

“You don’t believe or you don’t dare?” The Bloompheonix Princess’ words radiated with prestige.

“Farewell.” Ye Feng turned around and left. The moment he turned around, his face turned dark. He was planning to use Lin Yun to establish his presence, but in the end, the princess had used him to establish her presence instead. If he knew this would happen, he wouldn’t have bit onto Lin Yun when the elders spoke up.

The disciples beneath the stage were all amused by this scene. No one had expected that Ye Feng, whose cultivation had reached the quasi-Violet Palace Realm, would have such an ending.

The elders on the high platform frowned their brows unhappily. But this was the princess and the Sword Firmament Pavilion owed her one. In the end, they could only pity Ye Feng for his bad luck. He could’ve used anyone to establish his presence, but he really had to choose Lin Yun despite knowing that the princess was here. Who didn’t know that the princess looked at Lin Yun differently? Ye Feng was asking for it.

Watching Ye Feng leave, Lin Yun sighed in pity. He was looking forward to giving Ye Feng a surprise with the spiritual runes painting. Now that he thought about it, Ye Feng was rather pitiful. Then again, he couldn’t help revealing a smile at this moment.

“Junior Brother, why aren’t you thanking Her Highness for getting you out of a tough situation?” Xin Yan smiled while winking at Lin Yun.

“Thank you, Your Highness.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together.

“You don’t have to thank me. After all, I’m just being nosy in your view,” replied the princess. “I know what you’re thinking. You might have some trump cards to deal with that one move and you might even be able to inflict heavy injuries to him. However, Ye Feng’s attack will also injure you heavily. Don’t forget that the Dragon Gate Competition is just one month from now. You won’t be able to participate if you’re heavily injured.”

Lin Yun’s face changed when he thought about that because what the princess said was true. Ye Feng clearly came prepared, so even if Lin Yun could injure Ye Feng with the spiritual runes painting, he might also be injured in the process.

If he didn’t have to participate in the Dragon Gate Competition, then it didn’t matter for him to fight Ye Feng. But it would be a great loss if he was heavily injured since he was planning to participate.

“I was too impulsive,” replied Lin Yun after understanding the situation better.

“No worries,” replied the princess. There wasn’t a shred of emotion in her voice.

“Junior Brother, I know that you’ll participate in the Dragon Gate Competition. Where do you intend to cultivate for the next month?” Xin Yan didn’t have to ask to know what Lin Yun was planning.

“The Extermation Mountain Range. I was planning to pay you a visit at the Locket Mountain before leaving, but I didn’t expect to see you here. Since that’s the case, then I won’t delay any longer and I’ll head off immediately,” said Lin Yun.

“Then let me and Her Highness send you off.”

“Hehe, me too!” chuckled Li Wuyou. With that, the four of them left the plaza.

The Extermination Mountain Range was at the back of the Sword Firmament Pavilion. It was a famous mountain range in the Heavenly Qin County because all four major sects were established at the borders of the mountain range.

The mountain range was endless and it stretched out to several empires. Lin Yun had come here many times, so he was familiar with the place. There was no lack of Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts at the core of the mountain range and he even heard that there were Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts.

The mountain range was covered in a poisonous fog and the roars of demonic beasts would sound out from time to time. The sun hung high in the sky, which made the poisonous mist reflect bright colors. It looked like a rainbow fog and gave an extremely peculiar feeling.

The princess and everyone else stopped when they were at the borders of the mountain range. Everyone knew that Lin Yun was going into the mountain range to cultivate, so they could only send him off here.

The next time they meet would be at the Dragon Gate competition. However, this was based on the condition that Lin Yun made it out of the mountain range alive.

“Let’s bid our farewell here. Thank you for sending me off,” said Lin Yun from on top of the Dragon Blooded Horse while cupping his hands.

“Be careful. I know that you’ll definitely head to the core, but remember that the Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts won’t let you off.” Xin Yan looked at Lin Yun with concern in her eyes.

“Don’t worry about it, Senior Sister. I will make it out alive,” smiled Lin Yun embarrassedly. There was nothing he could keep from Xin Yan.

“Big Brother, I’ll wait for you at the Dragon Gate Stage,” smiled Li Wuyou. It was as if he believed that nothing would happen to Lin Yun.

Lin Yun swept a glance at the princess. After a long hesitation, he asked, “Your Highness, may I speak with you privately?”

The princess was shocked, but she didn’t say a word. However, Li Wuyou was dumbfounded when he heard that.

“Your Highness, my junior brother is an honest person and it should be fine talking to him alone,” said Xin Yan as she bit her lips.

“Okay,” said the princess a long time later.

After bidding farewell to Xin Yan and Li Wuyou, Lin Yun patted the Dragon Blooded Horse to send it away. With that, Lin Yun and the princess were the only ones left.

The princess waited for everyone to leave before she said, “Speak.”

“Your Highness, I’m sorry!” Lin Yun’s hand bolted for the princess’ veil all of a sudden.
