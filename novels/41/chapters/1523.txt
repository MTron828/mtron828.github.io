Chapter 1524 - There's A Need For A Dream (1)

“Although you’ve already experienced it once, I must warn you of the pain, especially since the Blue Dragon Bone is much stronger than the Azure Dragon Bone. The two are not at the same level at all.” Lil’ Purple said. “That Azure Dragon Bone was special because the Azure Dragon King left it behind. Otherwise, there’s no way the Azure Dragon Bone can be compared to a Divine Dragon Bone.”

“I can endure it.” Lin Yun took in a deep breath. He had an intense obsession with a Divine Dragon Bone. If he couldn’t obtain a Divine Dragon Bone today, it might really become a demon in his heart. This meant he wouldn’t be able to take another step in his lifetime.

Now that the opportunity was right before him, he wouldn’t take a step back, regardless of the pain he had to go through.

After Lil’ Purple took the Blue Dragon Bone from Lin Yun, she briefly glanced at it before the two runes on her forehead emitted a bewitching light.

When the Blue Dragon Bone blazed in her hand, the flames on its surface looked like magma. The magma emitted a holy light that shone brightly with a golden light, and the divine runes on her forehead were emitting a dazzling azure light.

A torrential draconic aura suddenly exploded with a draconic roar echoing throughout the hall. The dragon's roar was like arrows colliding with the surrounding walls, making the surrounding space look like it was about to collapse.

This made Lin Yun’s face change as he took several steps back. Under the immense pressure, Lin Yun fell onto one knee with his brows locked together. Beads of sweat also covered his forehead, and it felt like he was carrying a mountain.

He didn’t hesitate to form seals to summon the Golden Crow Wings since the draconic aura was too terrifying. It was ancient, like a ten thousand-year-old wine, and the pressure of the aura was unbelievably heavy.

“There’s no need to summon your wings. Walk over by yourself. If you can’t bear this dragon aura, you won’t be able to fuse with it. You need the Blue Dragon Bone to acknowledge you, at the very least!” Lil’ Purple indifferently said as he held onto the Blue Dragon Bone. The divine runes on her forehead were shining brightly.

The Blue Dragon Bone in her hand was radiant, as if it was responding to her. Then, the draconic aura crashed down on Lin Yun, becoming even heavier.

After Lin Yun raised his head with great difficulty, he looked at Lil’ Purple, feeling that she was a little too heartless. Bearing the pressure head-on, he could hear cracking sounds coming from his bones. Simultaneously, ten thousand dragon runes slowly appeared on the surface of his body.

The distance of barely ten meters took Lin Yun an hour, and he felt that his skeleton was going to break apart. Not giving him time to ponder, Lil’ Purple stabbed the Blue Dragon Bone into Lin Yun’s chest.

“ARGGGGHHH!” Lin Yun let out a painful howl while feeling that his heart was being torn apart. His chest was instantly covered in red, with blood pouring from it.

The wound on his chest was terrifying. It was so much so that anyone could see his beating heart; the Blue Dragon Bone in Lil’ Purple’s hand had fused into Lin Yun’s body through this wound.

When the Blue Dragon Bone fused into his body, the dragon bone began to burn before starting to melt like magma. Once the Blue Dragon Bone began to fuse with his ribs, it would bring great pain to Lin Yun. He could feel his ribs slowly shattering as the Blue Dragon Bone gradually fused into his body.

Lin Yun had experienced a similar pain before and now had to experience it again. But this time, the pain was a hundred-fold or even a thousand-fold stronger than before. This pain was penetrating deep into his soul, and he would lose his life if he wasn’t careful.

The pain made Lin Yun lose the ability to think. Soon, he didn’t even have the energy to yell out, and his pupils gradually lost focus. This was because he had entered a blurred and chaotic state.

“Don’t die.” Lil’ Purple stretched her hand out to touch Lin Yun’s forehead.

The touch was like a bucket of ice water pouring down, making him shiver from the bottom of his soul. In the next second, he continued to wail out in pain. As the Blue Dragon Bone fused into his body, the dragon runes on the surface of his body kept wriggling, as if they were being summoned. Along with the Blue Dragon Bone slowly fusing into his body, the dragon runes also entered the Blue Dragon Bone.

Simultaneously, the violent energy within the Blue Dragon Bone spread to his internal organs and four limbs. All his pores were opened, allowing wisps of blue light to be emitted from them. Looking from afar, it looked like a dragon was wrapping around him.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

As the violent aura spread throughout his body along with intense pain, the pain nearly made Lin Yun lose consciousness. But every time he was about to lose consciousness, a chill would instantly wake him up, and he would continue to let out a miserable wail.

Lil’ Purple’s hand was like a thousand-year-old ice, preventing Lin Yun from fainting. Looking at Lin Yun being in pain, she also felt heartache for him, but she knew he couldn’t stop now.

Divine Dragon Bones were unique, and he would never be able to wake up again if he lost consciousness from the pain. As the merging of the Divine Dragon Bone sped up, Lin Yun opened his eyes, and his pupils shone brightly with a blue radiance.

Lil’ Purple let go and gently retreated. Under the surge of violent energy, Lin Yun’s body subconsciously hovered in the air with a terrifying blue light shining from every single one of his pores. As his hair fluttered violently, his entire face was distorted from the pain.

The wound on his chest was slowly being healed and the vitality within his body would violently roar with every heartbeat. A blue dragon was surrounding him. As the thunderstorm roared, the dragon aura he released began to violently rise.

A brief moment later, Lin Yun, who was hovering in the air, released a ferocious roar. The fierce roar was no different from a dragon’s roar, and the aura of a divine dragon violently swept out, making no one dare to look him in the eyes.

In Lil’ Purple’s eyes, she could see Lin Yun being wrapped in a blue light while emitting a holy and violent aura. Dragons were divine beasts, and they were born in primal chaos. They were also primordial ominous beasts.

More accurately speaking, aside from some auspicious beasts, most divine beasts were ferocious and couldn’t be judged with human morals. Then again, being ominous beasts didn’t mean that they were devilish beasts. Devilish beasts were pure manifestations of evil, and the world rejected them from their birth.

Lil’ Purple’s eyes flashed with concern. After all, it was a Divine Dragon Bone. Even if the Blue Dragon Bone had no intelligence, the ferocity deep within the dragon bone wasn’t something just anyone could subdue.

If Lin Yun couldn’t subdue the ferocity, he would be reduced to a beast. At that time, the dragon bone would devour Lin Yun and use his body for its rebirth.
