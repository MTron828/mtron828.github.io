Chapter 902 - Despair

The entire hall was empty as traces of divine astral pellet aura lingered in the air. However, there was nothing left.

“Damn it, what is going on?!” Chen Qiong was completely dumbfounded by the empty hall. “I can clearly sense the aura of at least 100 divine astral pellets!”

Chen Qiong couldn’t maintain his composure when he thought about 100 divine astral pellets. It was an amount that would make the geniuses from higher realms start fighting each other. After all, an empyrean would have to spend an entire month to refine a divine astral pellet in the Kunlun Realm.

An empyrean expert’s time was precious, so one could imagine the value of one divine astral pellet. Even in ancient times, empyreans would also have to spend at least half a month to refine a divine astral pellet in the Heavenly Path. But if an empyrean was in seclusion for an entire month, they could probably refine about 10.

Only the top-tier empyreans could refine divine astral pellets at a faster pace. Currently, no one could refine divine astral pellets in the Heavenly Path, which made them even more precious. Of course Chen Qiong would lose his mind when such wealth was slipping away from him.

It would have been fine if he didn’t know anything about it, but he clearly sensed the pellets earlier.

Even Xian Yunzhen’s face was nasty. But he was more composed than Chen Qiong and spoke coldly, “Lin Yun! It must have been him! Who else could have taken away all the divine astral pellets?”

“Was it really him? How is that possible? How can he possibly be ahead of us with his strength?” Chen Qiong sounded doubtful after recovering his composure.

“I also don’t want to believe this, but he was the only one who entered the Hidden Treasure Pavilion with us. I didn’t sense any geniuses from higher realms around us, so who else could it be?!” Xian Yunzhen said coldly.

Xian Yunzhen didn’t want to admit this since it was basically like slapping himself in the face. He had already declared that Lin Yun wouldn’t get far in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion. However, the current scene was proving him wrong. In the end, all Xian Yunzhen could do was swallow his humiliation.

“Was it really him?” Chen Qiong said in a depressed tone. “B-but isn’t he too ruthless to leave nothing for us?”

“Weren’t you thinking about emptying everything as well? Didn’t you want to see his expression?” Xian Yunzhen said coldly.

“I…” Chen Qiong’s face blushed when he heard that. He was just giving a suggestion to make Lin Yun look like a fool. It turned out that he was a fool.

Unable to control his temper anymore, Chen Qiong roared, “That bastard! We forgot that he’s a swordsman who grasped greater mastery of spiritual sword intent! It’s strong against the demonic corpses. We have to hurry or else we’ll be left behind!”

They would become a joke if others knew that they were fooled by a brat from the Profound Amber Realm.

“Wait up.” Xian Yunzhen called out to Chen Qiong.

“What’s wrong?” Chen Qiong asked.

Looking at Chen Qiong like he was looking at an idiot, Xian Yunzhen said, “Are you stupid? We’ll be surrounded by demonic corpses again if you pick a random path. We have to find the path he took or we’ll never be able to catch up to him.”

When Chen Qiong heard what Xian Yunzhen said, he suddenly realized his foolishness. There were too many paths, and it would be tough for them to catch up to Lin Yun if they took a random path.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun and Lil’ Red had already reached the second main hall. There were two powerful demonic corpses guarding the hall, but Lin Yun easily used Lightning Cocoon to tear them into pieces. Simultaneously, he was becoming more proficient in Lightning Cocoon.

Sheathing the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun started to examine the hall. The items in this hall were all sorts of fortune martial techniques. When Lin Yun examined them, he found that they were mostly lesser and intermediate fortune martial techniques. Only a few were greater fortune martial techniques. As for advanced fortune martial techniques, he couldn’t find a single one.

But Lin Yun still took the fortune martial techniques because they could sell for a decent price outside. He could also save them for his companions from the Profound Amber Realm. With these fortune martial techniques, it should be enough for them to obtain the tribulation qualification.

“According to this clan’s foundation, it makes no sense for them not to have any advanced fortune martial techniques. They’re probably in the higher levels, but it’s a pity that there are only three levels here…” Lin Yun didn’t think that there would be advanced fortune martial techniques on the third level because the things on the first and second levels were completely different.

Just when he was in deep thoughts, a streak of light flew over to him. Lil’ Red had tossed him something after searching the two corpses for a long time.

“Sunchasing Art’s Heavenly Soul Realm Volume, an imperial fortune martial technique. Five centuries ago, a powerhouse comprehended the dao and left behind a thousand words before his death. The ancestors of my clan obtained a hundred words and comprehended the Sunchasing Art.

“The Heavenly Soul Realm Volume is also named Ten Profound Steps, corresponding with the Golden Crow’s nine transformations. One has to reach the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm to cultivate it and one needs fortune to find the other sections of this cultivation technique. It’s not recommended for those without enough talent.” Information flowed into Lin Yun’s mind and left him dumbfounded for a long time.

It was really interesting. The Seven Profound Step and Cloudsoaring Art he had cultivated were derived from the Sunchasing Art. However, he never expected to run into the genuine Sunchasing Art.

He still remembered from the Seven Profound Steps that a powerhouse chased after the sun to create the Sunchasing Art in ancient times. But according to the story he just read, it was only five hundred years ago. Lin Yun was deeply shocked in his heart. Just what kind of era did this technique come from and why did that era come to an end?

It took a long time for Lin Yun to calm down. It seemed that the origin of this clan wasn’t simple. But perhaps it was only a branch from the main clan.

“You really are an expert when it comes to searching corpses.” Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling while looking at Lil’ Red. He was thankful that Lil’ Red found it for him.

Suddenly, Lin Yun recalled that only those in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm could cultivate it and sighed, “I still have a ways to go.”

He had long heard that advanced fortune martial techniques had a strict requirement on cultivation. Lin Yun knew that overlord fortune martial techniques required cultivators to be in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm at the very least.

But an imperial fortune martial technique was at the second highest grade that even ordinary empyreans might not be qualified to practice. So it was already heaven-defying that the Ten Profound Steps could be practiced in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Time to leave.” When Lil’ Red cleared everything in the main hall, it ran back to Lin Yun as they headed to the third level.

An hour later, two figures rushed into the empty hall on the second floor. They were Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen. Their faces were grave and their hearts were heavy. When they saw the empty hall, their minds nearly collapsed.

“Damn it! That bastard emptied the hall again!” Chen Qiong cursed with a nasty face.

Xian Yunzhen looked around before he said, “This place should have fortune martial techniques…ancient fortune martial techniques! Even an ordinary fortune martial technique has incredible value.”

There was no question that modern fortune martial techniques couldn’t be compared to the ones in ancient times. Aside from fortune martial techniques from sacred grounds, modern fortune martial techniques were generally a lot weaker.

“T-there’s nothing here! Nothing is left for us!” yelled Chen Qiong after searching every corner of the hall. He even found several secret compartments, but those compartments had claw marks that indicated the items were already taken away.

“Damn it! There’s nothing left! They even raided the corpses!” Xian Yunzhen also searched the corpses and found nothing. At this moment, his hands were trembling with rage.

“Continue searching! I don’t believe that there’s nothing left behind in such a big hall!” Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong’s faces were pale as they flipped the entire hall upside down only to find nothing. They were filled with despair and they started to doubt themselves.

“Let’s go to the third level. We can’t let him leave until he hands everything over to us!” Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong were enraged as they charged to the third level.
