Chapter 1445 - Divine Golden Crow Iron

The hit from Lin Yun was painful. This shocked Chen Ling as he looked at Lin Yun, wondering if Lin Yun really was only at the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. The strength behind that punch was too terrifying, and Lin Yun was simply a monster.

But he had reached the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. So just when he was about to fall to his knees, the three stars in his violet palace revolved, wrapping him in starlight. Under the empowerment of the three stars, the astral energy in his body began to surge and instantly multiplied thrice. As his sword aura exploded, he soared to the sky before pushing his palm out at Lin Yun’s chest.

As lightning crackled on the surface of Lin Yun’s body, five thousand dragon runes flickered, making Chen Ling feel as though his palm had landed on a mountain. The rebound force sent him flying ten meters back. When he landed on the ground, Chen Ling took three steps back.

Lin Yun’s expression remained the same as he tapped his foot in the air three times before he landed on the ground.

“This is the strength of the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm? If my Azure Dragon Saint Art didn’t improve, I wouldn’t be able to take that palm when relying on my cultivation alone…” Lin Yun inwardly muttered as his gaze flickered. He could feel a vague aching from his chest, and it was fortunate that the dragon runes blocked 70% of that palm, or his ribs would have cracked from that palm.

Even if his ocean of astral energy had reached thirty thousand meters, the difference in their cultivation was still too huge. Chen Ling wasn’t wrong, since the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm was a threshold. It was on a new level when compared to the one-star and two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realms.

Lin Yun was shocked, but he didn’t know that Chen Ling was more shocked than him. This made Chen Ling feel like he was a clown after saying that his advantage against Lin Yun would be too great. This was because Lin Yun’s foundation was too strong. When Lin Yun was still at the Greater Elysium Core Realm, his foundation was stronger than when Chen Ling was at the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

A brief moment later, Chen Ling raised his head with a bitter smile. “I now understand why the sect master made you a heaven direct disciple. You’re truly qualified.”

“Let’s carry on. I almost couldn’t take that palm of yours earlier.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Alright. I’ll be using my full strength now!” Chen Ling’s eyes blazed with fighting spirit because he nearly fell to his knees earlier. He was unconvinced that the gap between them would be so significant.

As flames and lightning intertwined, two figures began to fight on the training ground. When they stopped one hour later, Lin Yun turned to Chen Ling, “Junior Brother Chen, how far are you compared to the top ten on the Earth Ranking?”

“The difference is huge. I can barely fight Senior Brother Zhou Tao, who’s tenth on the Earth Ranking. I roughly have 30% odds of winning against him.” Chen Ling smiled.

“Only 30%?” The odds were too low, lower than Lin Yun had imagined.

“What’s the main difference between you and him?” Lin Yun asked.

“Cultivation technique and martial techniques.” Chen ling sighed. “Those in the top ten have brought their ghost spirit martial techniques to the greater mastery at the very least. My Primordial Netherserpent Sword is incomplete, so there’s a limit to how far I can go. I’m only at the lesser mastery with it.”

“What about cultivation technique?” Lin Yun asked.

As they walked, Chen Ling smiled before he sighed, “The difference in our cultivation technique is even greater. You should know that the five peaks have their own respective sword sutras. The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra of our Divine Firmament Peak is hard to grasp, and I’m already facing difficulties in the third stage. I must reach the Dragon Pulse Realm before I can barely cultivate it. But the other sword sutras can be cultivated in the Elysium Core Realm and are powerful. So they naturally have the advantage if we’re in the same cultivation.”

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered when he heard about the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

“The Scarlet Firmament Sword Sutra, Azure Firmament Sword Sutra, Indigo Firmament Sword Sutra, and Golden Firmament Sword Sutra are famous ghost spirit sword sutras in the Ancient Barren Domain.” Chen Ling’s eyes blazed with scorching heat, and he continued, “This is why so many swordsmen wanted to join the Sword Sect, since they were fatally attractive to any swordsman.”

“Does that mean that the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra is weak?” Lin Yun asked with his face changed.

“Weak? Of course not…” Chen Ling said sternly. “The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra becomes more difficult the further you reach, but it's too hard to cultivate. The last time someone grasped the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra at the Elysium Core Realm was eighteen years ago and it was Senior Jian Jingtian. Before him, no one had accomplished it for the past centuries.”

Lin Yun couldn’t remember how often he heard Jian Jingtian’s name in the past month he was in the Sword Sect.

“Each sword sutra has its own characteristics. The Scarlet Firmament Sword Sutra grasps the sun's power, the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra grasps the transformation of the clouds, the Indigo Firmament Sword Sutra grasps lightning, and the Golden Firmament Sword Sutra focuses on sharpness…” Chen Ling briefly paused before he continued, “The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra’s characteristic lies in absolute annihilation.”

As Lin Yun muttered the names of those sword sutras, he now had a general understanding of them.

“Where’s Lin Yun? I’m Chang Yu, here under the order of the sect master.” While Lin Yun was chatting with Chen Ling, a robust voice resounded outside the Cloud Soaring Peak.

When Chen Ling heard that voice, his eyes lit up. “Your confer and reward are here!”

“What do you mean by confer?” Lin Yun was baffled.

“The identity as a heaven direct disciple!” Chen Ling said excitedly. He looked to be even more excited than Lin Yun.

“Let’s go! Let’s go and take a look!” Lin Yun rejoiced.

When they flew out, they met Elder Chang Yu, who was here under the orders of the sect master. This was a middle-aged man who wore a stern expression. He was from the Elder Hall, not amongst the seven peaks, and their position was higher than the elders of the various peaks.

“You’re Lin Yun?” Chang Yu had never seen Lin Yun before, but he could easily tell who he was looking for.

“That’s right. Disciple pays his greetings to Elder Chang.” Lin Yun hurriedly bowed.

Lin Yun’s respect made Chang Yu wear a smile on his face. As a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, Lin Yun was pretty polite, unlike the rumors about him.

“Although the sect master granted you the status as a heaven direct disciple three days ago, there are still some procedures and some things that must be refined. So it will take some time. Now that your name is on the record, you will receive the treatment of a heaven direct disciple from now on.” Chang Yu turned his hand over, and a golden waist medal appeared in his hand.

When Lin Yun received the metal, he was surprised by its weight. The front of the medal was a Sword Sect’s symbol, and the back had ‘Divine Firmament Lin Yun’ on it.

“This medal itself is a thousand-rune saint artifact. Once you activate a hundred saint runes, it can form into a Divine Firmament Sword Array that can even fend off a Samsara Edict Realm expert for half an hour.” Chang Yu explained. “Aside from that, you can head to the Contribution Hall every month to receive a large number of contributions. You can freely enter and exit many forbidden places in the sect. You can take your time to explore them later.”

Lin Yun fell in love with the medal upon hearing about it from Chang Yu. As long as he activated a hundred saint runes, he could fend off the attacks of a Samsara Edict Realm expert for half an hour.

“These are Profound Wither Pellets, a total of ten.” Chang Yu briefly explained, “The Profound Wither Pellets are sixth-grade saint elixirs. As long as you’re alive, you can instantly recover from any injuries by just consuming one.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up even further. The Sword Sect was really generous to him, and his current treatment wasn’t at all inferior to a member of the Ancient Saint Clan or even better.

“This is Heavenly Soul Armor!” Chang Yu handed a piece of soft armor to Lin Yun. This armor was thin, akin to a cicada’s wings, but it also emitted a faint warmth.

A smile rose even further on Lin Yun’s face because he knew this was a treasure and quickly stowed it. But Cheng Yu didn’t stop there. He took out a black metal box that was sealed in an interspatial bracelet.

When Lin Yun looked at the metal box, he felt that the box's contents weren’t ordinary.

“Lin Yun, this is the Divine Golden Crow Iron, something the sect master gave you personally.” Chang Yu looked at Lin Yun, then continued, “This Divine Golden Crow Iron has an origin saint rune engraved in it, and it also contains the divine blood of the Golden Crow. The sect master knows that you have the Golden Crow Wings, so this can transform them if you refine it.”

Hearing that left Lin Yun so shocked that he couldn’t utter a word because this was simply too precious. Even Lil’ Purple had exclaimed in the sword box while also being shocked, “Oh my god. Is the sect master insane? He even gave you the Divine Golden Crow Iron?!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Looking at Lin Yun, Chang Yu continued, “Heaven direct disciples are the cornerstone of our Sword Sect. The sect master will personally give every heaven direct disciple a treasure. But I’ve never seen the sect master give away such a precious treasure. So you have to cherish it well, Lin Yun.”

“I will keep that in mind!” When Lin Yun received the metal box, it weighed like a mountain in his hand, which made his face change because it was simply too heavy.

“Lin Yun, Lin Yun, you can’t use it now. So, why don’t you give it to me? I’ll refine it for you, hehe!” Lil’ Purple said eagerly, with excitement flashing in her pupils.

“Go away!” Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with Lil’ Purple. He wouldn’t give it to her even if he didn’t need it. It was a gift from the sect master, so he just had to store it well and let his Golden Crow Wings become stronger in the future. Lin Yun looked forward to seeing how strong his Golden Crow Wings would become.

“Hmph. You scumbag. You’re not even willing to part with a piece of divine iron.” Lil’ Purple said unhappily. Then again, no one could listen to their conversation.

“I believe you know that you can pick a ghost spirit martial technique with this medal.” Chang Yu smiled before he softly sighed, “I’ll take my leave first. If you need any help in the future, you can look for me at the Elder Hall.”

Just like that, Chang Yu came and left quickly. Chen Ling, who was watching from the side, nearly fell to his knees. He was initially envious of Lin Yun, but he gradually became numb. Even so, he was startled when Chang Yu gave Lin Yun the Divine Golden Crow Iron.

“Lin Yun, you have to keep that a secret. Many people are already unhappy with you, and it’ll be even more chaotic if they know that the sect master gave you a Divine Golden Crow Iron!” Chen Ling said hurriedly after he recovered from his shock.

“No secrets can be kept forever, and it’s just a matter of time for them to find out.” Lin Yun said calmly with a faint smile. “If they’re unhappy, they just have to suck it up. If they can’t suck it up, they can come and look for me. After all, I have a good temper!”

When Chen Ling saw the smile on Lin Yun’s face, he awkwardly smiled in response. For some reason, he could feel that something wasn’t right, but Lin Yun didn’t seem to be wrong about him having a good temper.
