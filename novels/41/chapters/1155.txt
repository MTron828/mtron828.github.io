Chapter 1156 - Massacre

The entire region was riddled with the aura of Lin Yun and Lei Ying’s attacks. The attacks left Lin Yun exhausted as the exposed part of his face was pale. Lei Ying was a lot stronger than Lin Yun had imagined, which showed that Lei Ying was a genius of the demonic sect and not just an ordinary quasi-Elysium Core Realm expert. Lin Yun was certain now that Lei Ying was a top-tiered genius in the demonic sect, and that the name Lei Ying might be fake.

It wasn't a full moon right now, so Lin Yun couldn’t execute his strongest attack even if the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute was stronger than Lei Ying’s blade.

So he couldn’t gain an advantage against Lei Ying’s saint artifact. Lin Yun was realizing why the Elysium Core Realm elders died to Lei Ying.

The attack from earlier nearly destroyed all of his golden-purple dragon runes. Fortunately, Lin Yun managed to bear through the pain.

As he gasped for air, he looked at Ye Ziling and noticed that her complexion was rosy. Without her usual indifferent expression, her face looked very pretty.

Despite the exhaustion assaulting his mind, Lin Yun struggled to get back up. But the sword box on his back was too heavy. Plus, the origin stone was struggling to break free again. With his eyes blazing with fighting spirits, Lin Yun wore a smile.

He couldn’t afford to fall because he was Flower Burial! When Lin Yun let out a roar, he straightened his back and stood up within the cloud of dust. Suddenly, his surroundings began to buzz with sword intent because it could sense Lin Yun’s fighting spirits.

Lin Yun couldn’t allow himself to fall. He was determined to fight until his dying breath. Suddenly, Lin Yun began to laugh maniacally.

“Is this fellow insane?!” When the demonic cultivators watched Lin Yun get up, they were completely dumbfounded. As demonic cultivators, they were naturally brutal and cruel, but Lin Yun looked to be even more insane than them!

“Damn it!” Lei Ying cursed because he didn’t feel good right now, especially after multiple battles. He even took out his saint sword, but he still failed to kill Lin Yun.

“Are you competing with me to see who’s more ruthless? Brat, you have no idea how I got my title as the strongest demonic cultivator in the Profound Wither Sea!” Lei Ying fully unleashed his astral energy with lightning and flames sweeping out.

The saint runes on his blade began to wiggle as he sent a violent storm towards Lin Yun. The storm was empowered by the saint runes that contained lightning, flame, and blade intent.

Sun Concealing Clouds!

Lin Yun began to play the flute. Lei Ying wasn’t the only one with a saint artifact. In fact, Lin Yun’s Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute was a lot stronger than Lei Ying’s blade. When he played the first sword of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords through music, he unleashed a sword ray that tore the storm apart.

Lin Yun charged forward as soon as the two attacks collided. He then played the second sword of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. At the same time, two Azure Birds flew out from his body.

Lei Ying was shocked because he never imagined that Lin Yun would dare to take the initiative to attack. So he brandished his blade to destroy the incoming attacks. As Lin Yun continued to retreat, the clash between the blade ray and sword ray shined brightly.

“Attack together!” Lei Ying staggered because he was reaching his limit from his injuries. Although he managed to kill the two Elysium Core Realm elders, they both left a terrifying sword intent within his body before they died.

Initially, he had forcibly suppressed his injuries. However, he was forced to bring out his constellation to deal with Ye Ziling, which allowed the sword intent in his body to wreak havoc. He knew that he would be killed if the sword intent left in his body exploded.

The other demonic cultivators were completely terrified by Lin Yun’s aura, but they were even more afraid of Lei Ying and didn’t dare to disobey his orders. Without any hesitation, the demonic cultivators charged forward under Xiao Kun’s lead. They knew that Lin Yun’s flute music was strong, but they were prepared this time and didn’t dare to approach Lin Yun carelessly.

As Lin Yun continued to play the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, more Azure Birds continued to fly out from his body with an aura comparable to the Sword Saint Mountain. But even so, Lin Yun was covered in injuries as he dealt with the various attacks of the demonic cultivators. But just when Lin Yun finished fighting with the demonic cultivators, Lei Ying, who managed to catch his breath, took a deep breath and swung his blade with both hands.

“Die!” Lei Ying roared as his blade manifested into a demonic palm. Lin Yun’s face changed because he was familiar with that attack. However, the aura of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords had reached its peak, so there was a chance he might make it.

“Brat, hand over your life!” But just when Lin Yun was about to combine the aura of the ten swords, Xiao Kun’s cold voice sounded out. Xiao Kun wanted to deal a fatal wound to Lin Yun while the latter was so focused. He believed that no one could split their mind, and he was confident that Flower Burial would lose his life.

But Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a decisive light. He suddenly lowered his flute and put a stop to the music, which stunned everyone.

“Die!” Xiao Kun couldn’t be bothered with it as he continued his attack. If he remembered correctly, Flower Burial had two saint artifacts, and there was an astronomical bounty on his head.

“Divine firmament manifest into my sword!” The sword cocoon shined brightly from Lin Yun’s forehead, causing the Silver Moon Mask to shine brightly. Empowered by his sword intent, Lin Yun threw the jade flute out as the noble tune sounded out from it once more.

Since he couldn’t wield the flute as a sword, he would just do it the other way around. Under the music, the aura of the swords combined. The ten Azure Birds charged towards the colossal palm, creating cracks on the gigantic palm. Demonic runes appeared on the palm as it shined brightly, but it ultimately exploded from the Azure Birds.

“H-h-how is this possible?!” Xiao Kun was completely left dumbfounded by this scene. When he recovered from his shock, he noticed that Lin Yun’s gaze was fixed on him. So when he saw Lin Yun summoning a sword out of the sword box, Xiao Kun began to panic, “N-N-N-NO!”

A moment later, Xiao Kun was split into two from Lin Yun’s sword ray, but the attacks from the other demonic cultivators reached Lin Yun at the same time. With many attacks landing on him, Lin Yun’s injuries became worse.

Lin Yun became furious as he lost all patience to deal with the idiots following Lei Ying.

Once the gigantic palm was destroyed, Lei Ying threw up a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground with one knee. Without any hesitation, he turned around to run for his life. As for the other demonic cultivators, they also planned on escaping after watching Lei Ying run.

“You guys want to come and go as you wish?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with violence as a crimson light swept out with his boundless killing aura. Letting out a roar, a powerful aura swept out of Lin Yun as he grabbed onto a demonic cultivator with his left hand and decapitated him with the sword in his right hand.

Lin Yun swung his sword once more, unleashing his quasi-divine firmament sword intent. Instantly, three Galaxy Stages demonic cultivators were torn into pieces. Afterwards, Lin Yun continued his assault.

At this moment, he was like a deity who had descended on the mortal realm. When he swept his glance out once more, he found a gray-clothed man. This particular demonic cultivator had launched multiple sneak attacks on him, which caused the aura in his eyes to surge even more.

So Lin Yun chased after the demonic cultivator, who was screaming in fear, “D-Don’t kill me! I’m innocent! Everything was ordered by Lei Ying! As long as you spare my life, I’ll tell you all the secrets about Lei Ying! Spare me! I’ll even help you kill him!”

Innocent? This man dared to say that he was innocent? Lin Yun let out a roar and swung his sword out, claiming the life of the demonic cultivator, “What a clown! Why would I need a clown like you?!”

The demonic cultivators in the Profound Wither Sea were known for their brutality, and the four major sects were turning a blind eye. But since they caused trouble with him, Lin Yun would show them the true meaning of brutality.

After a long amount of time passed, no one else stood in the stone forest. Blood and corpses littered the ground as Lin Yun had killed all of Lei Ying’s demonic cultivators. If a massacre couldn’t be avoided, Lin Yun would cleanse all evil in the world through a massacre!
