Chapter 1914 - Departure

After reaching the fourth level, Lin Yun did not continue to challenge the trials. The Celestial Purging Mountain had a total of nine levels, and each level was a threshold. The trials tested comprehension, eyesight, and sword dao.

The fourth level also had a mountain, and Lin Yun’s pupils were confused when he reached the summit. After all, he could only reach the summit after making it through four trials in the previous levels. But he reached the summit after three trials in the fourth level.

He smoothly obtained ten four-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits and couldn’t find where the fourth trial was. As he looked around, he noticed a massive ground on the clouds at the border of the mountain, like a vast plain.

“Found it!” Lin Yun finally found where the fourth trial was, and it was a grand palace at the far end. This palace was enveloped in clouds, looking mysterious and ancient. A terrifying sword aura was being emitted from the palace, filling this entire region. He tried tossing a rock over, and the rock was crushed to dust after it flew a hundred meters out.

“There’s something weird…” Lin Yun muttered. He had enveloped the rock with his sword intent, and it wasn’t something that could be so easily crushed, even if someone at the Nirvana Stage tried.

Right then, two figures appeared behind Lin Yun. They were Wang Muyan and Bai Shuying, who made it through three trials. When the two saw Lin Yun, they were surprised that he was ahead of them.

“Ever since the holy son of the Dao Yang Palace reached the fifth level, it has been over a decade since anyone reached the fifth level,” Wang Muyan sighed, before she flew over to the sea of clouds.

She took out a red cloth that flew out. As the red cloth continued to fly out, the clothes on her began to decrease, and this was a scene that could make everyone’s heart boil. The red cloth was covered with saint runes. When she waved the red cloth, an ancient sword aura spread out, clearing a path.

The red cloth was actually a powerful Glory Saint Artifact engraved with the Glorymoon Spirit. After it reached a hundred meters out, multiple figures appeared from the sea of clouds charging at Wang Muyan.

The red cloth coiled around Wang Muyan and she became enveloped in crimson flames while clashing against those figures. Aside from the Glorymoon Spirit, the red cloth also possessed the Gloryfire Spirit, a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact.

“Spiritual puppet!” Lin Yun noticed that those figures weren’t artifact spirits, or phenomena. But they were puppets created by Saint Spiritualists with saint runes engraved on them, and their cultivation was at the first transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

Their cultivation wasn’t high, but there were a lot of them. Wang Muyan was surrounded by over a hundred spiritual puppets in just a short amount of time. The puppets were strong, and one would have to exhaust a great amount of dragon origin to destroy them.

Lin Yun began to look around. There should be a saint puppet left behind after the death of a Heavenly Spiritualist. The sea of clouds was a massive spiritual array, and that saint puppet must be controlling this spiritual array.

It should be impossible for Wang Muyan to make it through this trial. Lin Yun instantly had a judgement, and Wang Muyan failed before she could even travel one-tenth of the distance. After all, this trial was too difficult because one had to resist the saint aura from the palace and fight the endless spiritual puppets.

After Wang Muyan, Bai Shuying drew her sword and dashed forth. Her sword was only half a meter in length, but it was powerful. It was engraved with Glorygold and Glorywood Spirits, and the sword was made of a rare metallic wood.

Lin Yun was shocked that both Bai Shuying and Wang Muyan possessed a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact. Previously, when he fought Wang Muyan, she didn’t use her Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, which meant she had more trump cards. But he wasn’t too bothered about it either because he also had his trump cards.

Bai Shuying’s performance was a lot better than Wang Muyan, and she made it to one-fifth of the distance. When they both lost, they weren’t in a hurry to leave and wanted to see how Ye Qingtian would make it through this trial.

But they were disappointed because he merely activated the medal and summoned a Celestial Crane down the mountain.

“It is so unlike you to give up without giving it a try,” Wang Muyan said with a playful smile.

“Even the two holy maidens have failed, so why should I try it?” Lin Yun could already tell he couldn’t make it through the trial with a glance. He could try using all his Glory Saint Artifacts, but the odds of him making it through wasn’t high. So he didn’t want to reveal his trump cards on something destined to fail.

To the two holy maidens, the trouble was the sword aura being emitted by the palace. It had restricted their strength. But to Lin Yun, the spiritual puppets were a headache because he had a massive disadvantage in his cultivation. He didn’t need to think to know he couldn’t make it through this trial.

I will make it through this trial sooner or later… Lin Yun muttered to himself as he climbed onto the Celestial Crane. The Celestial Crane brought Lin Yun down to the foot of the mountain with the two holy maidens following behind him, and their appearances instantly caused an uproar.

They weren’t surprised that the two holy maidens could make it to the fourth level with their accumulation over the years, but they were shocked that a newly conferred saint disciple like Ye Qingtian managed to reach the fourth level. Most importantly, Wang Muyan and Bai Shuying had countless pursuers within the Heavenly Dao Sect, so Ye Qingtian’s appearance with them was no different from hugging both ladies left and right. Ye Qingtian, naturally, acquired the envy and jealousy of countless people.

“Senior Sister Muyan is really strong. When her cultivation becomes higher, she might even be able to ascend to the fifth level and break the record left by the Dao Yang Holy Son.

“Senior Sister Bai is talented, and she will be able to stand out in the upcoming ranking battle!” The two holy maidens immediately became the center of attention as they descended the mountain.

Wang Muyan’s smile was brilliant, and she enjoyed being the center of attention. On the other hand, Bai Shuying was aloof and only replied to fellow disciples from the Nether Orchid Courtyard. Compared to them, Ye Qingtian looked lonely as someone who reached the fourth level.

When everyone recovered from their shock after seeing Ye Qingtian with the two holy maidens, they surrounded them and left Ye Qingtian out. But Lin Yun wasn’t too bothered and merely laughed it off.

“Senior Brother!” Chen Feng came forth with excitement and admiration in his pupils.

“Let’s go back to the Indigo Thunder Peak!” Lin Yun smiled and patted Chen Feng’s shoulder.

“Hehe.” Chen Feng nodded and smiled, “Senior Brother, is there a story between you and the two holy maidens? Especially the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden!”

“None,” Lin Yun smiled. Others felt he must be hugging the two ladies left and right since he made it to the fourth level with them. But in reality, he had a conflict with them.

It was complicated with Bai Shuying because she had misunderstood him, and there was a possibility that she might make a move against him at any moment. As for Wang Muyan, there was naturally nothing to say about her because she fooled Lin Yun. He would settle the score with her sooner or later, even if she was the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden.

“Ye Qingtian, leaving already?” Before Lin Yun and Chen Feng could go far, they were stopped by a group of people, with Ye Feifan and Chen Jun taking the lead. This immediately drew everyone’s attention, and they looked in this direction with puzzlement.

Ye Feifan’s face was ugly as he emitted murderous intent, and it was different from his usual gentlemanly disguise.

“What’s going on?” Many people whispered amongst themselves. Others didn’t know, but the saint disciples who reached the second level knew what was happening. It would be weird if Ye Feifan didn’t come after him after his humiliation by Ye Qingtian.

In the past, Ye Qingtian was no different from an ant in Ye Feifan’s eyes, and he could teach Ye Qingtian a lesson whenever he wanted. Ye Feifan wanted to teach Ye Qingtian a lesson before the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden. He failed to trick Ye Qingtian while on the Celestial Purging Mountain and was humiliated instead. So how could Ye Feifan possibly take it lying down?

“Brother, how can I help you?” Chen Feng was nervous, but Lin Yun was calm and composed.

“You forgot what you said on the second level?” Ye Feifan asked.

“Oh!” Lin Yun nodded and smiled, “I remembered. I promised to spare you a three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit, so here you go.”

Lin Yun took out a Heavenly Cloud Fruit that emitted three different colors.

“The Heavenly Cloud Fruit!”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It’s a three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit! After consuming it, I wonder how much it can strengthen the sword intent.”

“It heard that it would also strengthen the martial intent, cultivation, and mastery of martial techniques.”

“That’s not the key. Didn’t you hear what Ye Qingtian said? He wants to spare it for Ye Feifan!” Everyone was shocked by what Ye Qingtian said. In their eyes, Ye Qingtian was too cocky for a newly conferred saint disciple.

Ye Feifan was also shocked because he never expected Ye Qingtian to be so cocky in public, and he immediately felt his cheek burning with fury blazing within his heart.

But just when he wanted to make a move, Lin Yun stowed his smile and coldly asked, “You want to make a move? Ye Feifan, let me remind you that the person standing before you is Ye Qingtian, the direct disciple of the Dragon Origin Great Saint, while you’re only a disciple of a mere saint. Are you tired of living?”

Ye Feifan’s expression froze, and he immediately came to his senses. He realized that he was too careless and forgot that fact.

Everyone also came to their senses and remembered that Ye Qingtian was now the direct disciple of a Great Saint. So even if he was only at the Profound Death Stage, he wasn’t someone that just anyone could touch. They only momentarily forgot about it because of their past impression of Ye Qingtian. Few people within the Heavenly Dao Sect have a higher position than Ye Qingtian.

“Brother, you must be joking. How will I dare to touch the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s disciple.” Ye Feifan squeezed out a smile from his frozen face as he tried to maintain his composure.

“Brother? Who’s your brother?” Lin Yun roared.

Veins popped on Ye Feifan’s face, and he was on the verge of losing control. Anyone could sense the grievances in his heart right now.

“I’m a direct disciple of a Great Saint, while you’re the disciple of a mere saint. Your master isn’t even a Saint Sovereign. You think you’re worthy of calling me brother?” Lin Yun coldly questioned, not giving Ye Feifan any face. “Can I take it that you hold no respect for the Dragon Origin Great Saint?”

“Senior Brother Ye…” Ye Feifan whispered with an ugly expression.

“Louder. I can’t hear it,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“Senior Brother Ye!” Ye Feifan yelled. He was forcing a smile, but his smile was even uglier than crying.

“Senior brother wants to spare his junior brother a saint fruit. Is it very embarrassing? Forget it if you don’t want it…”

“Senior Brother, you must be joking.” Ye Feifan only wanted this matter to end quickly. He had already been humiliated, so he might as well take the three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit to save his losses.

But Lin Yun merely threw it to the ground and stepped on it under Ye Feifan’s shocked gaze. Lin Yun indifferently said, “Too late.”
