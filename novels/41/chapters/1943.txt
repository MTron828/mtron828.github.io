Chapter 1944 - Phoenix

Lin Yun wasn’t in the mood to joke around with her and reached out to grab her wrist. But his face soon changed because her injuries were serious. Lil’ Purple’s physique was reconstructed with the Azure Dragon True Bone, and it wasn’t her actual physique. So this physique of hers was weak. He asked, “You went to the Celestial Pool?”

“Yeah…” Lil’ Purple weakly nodded when she looked at Lin Yun’s expression.

Lin Yun had already predicted this, and he went behind her to treat her injuries with his Blue Dragon Bone. Within Lil’ Purple’s body, there were two martial intents, Frost Intent and Flame Intent, intertwining within her body like needles stuck in her internal organs. Many saint runes were engraved on those needles, making it look even more terrifying.

If he treated such injuries himself, the two extreme elements might explode if he was careless, and even a Quasi-Saint would lose his life. But he couldn’t get rid of those needles with the blue dragon aura alone. He had to use his Astral Sword Intent before using the blue dragon aura to heal the wounds.

Thus, he had to multitask, simultaneously splitting his mind into three. It didn’t take long for his forehead to be sweaty as the two extreme elements were expelled from Lil’ Purple’s body.

An hour later, Lil’ Purple threw out a mouthful of blood. Her face was still pale, but her complexion was better than before. She stood and moved around before chuckling, “Lin Yun, I’m fine now!”

But Lin Yun stood up and slowly approached Lil’ Purple. Seeing this, Lil’ Purple weakly said, before she could run, “I’m… I’m… fine now…”

But Lin Yun ignored her and grabbed her by her waist before he started smacking her butt. He didn’t hold back in his spanking, which made Lil’ Purple scream in pain. “Let me go!”

“Let me go, you scumbag!” Lil’ Purple tried to struggle with all her might, but Lin Yun had to teach her a lesson and didn’t hold back at all. “I’m sorry…! I have realized my mistake, so please let me down…!”

Half an incense later, Lin Yun stopped and let Lil’ Purple down. This made Lil’ Purple cower and tremble in fear, not daring to sit down because her butt was aching.

But Lin Yun kept silent and wasn’t in the mood to speak.

“I have realized my mistake!” Lil’ Purple came over to Lin Yun and said pitifully.

In the end, Lin Yun’s heart became soft, and he turned to look at Lil’ Purple. Lil’ Purple had been imprisoned in the sword box for a hundred thousand years, and her soul had been nourishing within his sea of consciousness. As for her physique, it was reforged with the Azure Dragon True Bone, so it wasn’t an understatement to say that she could be half-considered as his daughter, and Lin Yun wouldn’t hesitate to protect her many times.

“Who did it?” Lin Yun asked with a cold gaze. Even if he gave Lil’ Purple a beating, he still cared about her, and it was time for him to take revenge after teaching her a lesson.

“Bai Shuying,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun’s face changed because he thought that a senior within the Nether Orchid Courtyard would do it. But he didn’t expect that the culprit was Bai Shuying.

“Give me the Silvermoon Mask. She probably still hasn’t gotten far,” Lin Yun said.

“Don’t!” Lil’ Purple said. “She’s not to be blamed. I’m the one who was careless this time. So don’t kill her.”

Lin Yun smiled, “Who said that I want to kill her? I only wanted to teach her a lesson; I must do something since she severely injured you. Otherwise, others will think that we’re pushovers.”

“It’s my mistake!” Lil’ Purple said and immediately explained her experience in the Celestial Pool.

After hearing what Lil’ Purple said, Lin Yun smiled, “Then you really can’t blame her for it.”

After experiencing what Ye Qingtian did, Bai Shuying wouldn’t hesitate to move against those who dare to peek at her. But Lil’ Purple was foolish to stand there and allow Bai Shuying to attack her.

Since she could be placed on the same level as the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, this proved that she wasn’t simple. Lin Yun also didn’t take her words as a joke when Bai Shuying said she had taken countless lives, and he had been cautious against her.

Compared to her, Lil’ Purple was foolishly adorable. She still had to pretend to be aloof, even when receiving a beating and claimed she wanted to guide Bai Shuying in her martial techniques.

Thinking about it, Lin Yun couldn’t help laughing, “Bai Shuying is ruthless. She practiced the Heavenly Silkworm Hands, so you can be considered as her ancestor. But she used it against you.”

“I was only careless and was injured because I couldn’t dodge in time,” Lil’ Purple muttered, blushing.

“I wanted to make her your maid, so I can’t be too heavy with my moves, or I would’ve killed her. Yet, you’re despising me now. You scumbag!” Lil’ Purple said, and she even threw the blame on Lin Yun.

“Alright, it’s all my fault. Stop crying.” Lin Yun said, seeing that Lil’ Purple was on the verge of crying.

“Hmph, it’s all your fault! You smacked my butt so hard that I can’t sit down now. I’m the Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress, and how dare you smack my butt!” Lil’ Purple initially couldn’t cry, but she cried out as she spoke and hammered Lin Yun with her fists.

On the other hand, Lin Yun wore a gentle expression as he allowed Lil’ Purple to hammer him. When she was tired, he smiled, “I really hope you’re lying to me many times. I don’t hope you to be any empress, and I just hope you can be like other children.”

“Hmph, how can other kids compare to me? I’m born extraordinary and from the Divine Phoenix Clan’s…” Lil’ Purple said.

“What are you looking at?” Lin Yun suddenly took out a cauldron from his interspatial bracelet before she could finish. The Heavenly Astral Cauldron contained nearly twenty thousand kilograms of True Dragon Saint Liquid.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Because it was troublesome to contain it, Lin Yun immediately contained it with a cauldron. Then again, he had to return the cauldron after using it.

“The True Dragon Saint Liquid!” Lil’ Purple’s eyes shone brightly as she jumped onto the cauldron. Looking at the crimson liquid, she widened her eyes in disbelief as she looked at Lin Yun, “This is a considerably high grade. Lin Yun, how did you get so much of it?!”

Lin Yun merely responded with a smile. Lil’ Purple’s expression gave him a sense of satisfaction. After all, he nearly spent all eight million contribution points for the True Dragon Saint Liquid.

Lil’ Purple flew over and kissed Lin Yun on his cheek, “How much is there?”

“Nearly twenty thousand kilograms,” Lin Yun smiled.

“That’s great!” Lil’ Purple happily jumped around on the cauldron. But when she sat down on the cauldron by habit, she took a deep breath and yelled, “Ouch!”

“What’s the matter?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s all your fault!” Lil’ Purple glared at Lin Yun.

“I see… Your butt hurts…”

“You’re still talking about it?!” Lil’ Purple glared at Lin Yun, doing her best to put on a fierce expression. But she was too beautiful, and her ‘fierce’ expression only made her look more adorable.

“Hmph, I’ll forgive you. Let’s go and water the tree!” Lil’ Purple turned to look at the Phoenix Tree sapling with anticipation. “If the tree grows, I’ll also grow along with it. At that time, I’ll become a great beauty!”

Lin Yun merely wore an amicable smile and didn’t say a word.

“Hmph, what’s with that gaze of yours? Don’t you believe me? My true appearance is more beautiful than your Su Ziyao and Yue Weiwei,” Lil’ Purple said seriously.

“I believe you,” Lin Yun smiled and played along with her.

“Hmph, that’s more like it,” Lil’ Purple said with her head raised.

Over the next few days, they stayed in the Iris Secret Realm, focusing on the Phoenix Tree. The tree was fragile, and it wasn’t easy to let it absorb all of the True Dragon Saint Liquid.

This was an eye-opening experience for Lin Yun as he stayed by the side and had never heard of watering the Phoenix Tree with True Dragon Saint Liquid. He merely smiled as he looked at Lil’ Purple, hoping she could grow up happily like the Phoenix Tree.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye. Within the Nether Orchid Courtyard, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint called Bai Shuying over. When Bai Shuying heard what her master said, she was completely dumbfounded as she asked, “Master, you want me to go to Indigo Thunder Peak and look for Ye Qingtian?”

“Is there a problem with that? Or do you want me to invite him over myself?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked curiously.
