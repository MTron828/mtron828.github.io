Chapter 1882 - Courage

The woman leading this party wore a white dress while playing the lute, and she looked like an ethereal fairy filled with boundless charm when she turned around.

When Lin Yun looked closer at her appearance, he was so shocked that his hand holding the jar of wine froze in mid-air. This was because this woman was his Senior Sister Xinyan, Ye Xinyan.

So he naturally became dumbfounded as though he was struck by lightning. After all, he never expected that he would run into her here. Although her temperament had changed, Lin Yun could easily recognize her with a glance. She was the same Senior Sister Xinyan who cared for him at the Firmament Sword Pavilion. He still remembered how he drew his sword under that blizzarding night, and he wouldn’t forget Ye Xinyan even if he died.

When his expression fell into the eyes of the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples, it shocked them as they wore lecherous expressions. This was the senior brother that they knew of.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Senior Brother, that’s the direct disciple of the Serene Dust Great Saint from the Profound Maiden Courtyard, Miao Yin. Senior Brother, you can’t provoke her. Her master, the Serene Dust Great Saint is famous for being ruthless. She’s not at all inferior to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint!” Chen Feng warned.

“Junior Brother Chen is right. When Senior Sister Miao Yin just came to the Heavenly Dao Sect, many people tried to harass her, but they were all killed by the Serene Dust Great Saint.”

“The Serene Dust Great Saint is terrifying, and there are rumors that she has long surpassed the Great Saint Realm. Her cultivation is deep and unfathomable, and even the sect master has to treat her carefully.” The other Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples warned, fearing their senior brother might have ideas towards Miao Yin.

But Lin Yun frowned when he heard that name, and he shook his head. He believed that Miao Yin was Ye Xinyan. He ignored everyone else and hurried back into the Nether Orchid Courtyard, “I have to go back again.”

It didn’t take long for Ye Qingtian to reappear in the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

“Why is that fellow back again?” Everyone in the Nether Orchid Courtyard was shocked, not knowing what Lin Yun was trying to do. Even Bai Shuying had furrowed her brows with a hint of fury within her pupils. After all, Lin Yun had utterly ruined the Sword Discussion Gathering today, and he even left when she tried to stop him.

But Lin Yun returned a brief moment later, which naturally confused everyone about what Lin Yun was trying to do. Lin Yun ignored everyone’s gazes and walked towards the direction of the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples and looked at Ye Xinyan. He just wanted to hear her voice, so they didn’t have to acknowledge each other. He just had to hear her voice to know if she was Ye Xinyan.

“Lady Miao, you look like a friend of mine. Have we met before?” Lin Yun was direct and asked Miao Yin.

“Is that fellow insane?”

“He’s going after Miao Yin. Oh my god, is he insane?”

“He’s still the same Ye Qingtian we know. He hasn’t changed at all.” Everyone in the surroundings could no longer maintain their composure and were left dumbfounded. But this scene also made many people giggle.

“We have not.” Miao Yin replied.

“Senior Sister, he’s Ye Qingtian!”

“Ye Qingtian, are you tired of living? Get lost!”

“Don’t think that no one dares to touch you because you have the Azure River Sword Saint backing you up. If you enrage our master, no one can save you!” A woman beside Miao Yin hollered.

But Lin Yun wasn’t furious by her words; he had joy on his face instead. He was absolutely sure that Miao Yin was Ye Xinyan.

“Then I must have made a mistake. Big Sisters, I’ll be taking my leave, then.” Lin Yun smiled, then left. This was enough, even if Ye Xinyan didn’t recognize him. On the contrary, he wouldn’t have the courage if they had to acknowledge each other.

This puzzled Ye Xinyan because Lin Yun seemed like he had seen her before.

“Ye Qingtian, where do you think the Nether Orchid Courtyard is? Your garden where you can come and go as you wish?” A handsome youth beside Bai Shuying slammed his palm on the table. His name was Luo Cheng, and he was only twenty-three this year with a cultivation at the pinnacle third channel of the Profound Death Stage.

After a year of experience outside, he had his encounters and would be promoted to a saint disciple half a month from now. He also planned to use this Sword Discussion Gathering to stand out. But he never expected Lin Yun to steal all the limelight, especially his last move against Bai Shuying’s attack that nearly drove him insane from jealousy.

In reality, not only him but half of the people here had disdain for Lin Yun, while the other half looked at him with jealousy.

When Lin Yun looked at the flame blazing within Luo Cheng’s pupils, he smiled, “Junior Brother, we’re all disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect, and we should interact often. I welcome everyone here to the Indigo Thunder Peak.”

“Interact? Ye Qingtian, how dare you say that? You disguised yourself as a woman a year ago. You sneaked into my Nether Orchid Courtyard’s Celestial Pool and hid there for a year, ruining the reputation of countless girls and even our holy maiden…” Luo Cheng snickered.

As he spoke, the surroundings fell into silence. Luo Cheng could sense countless cold gazes on him. He immediately knew he had a slip of the tongue and roared, “Ye Qingtian, how dare you tell us to interact often. Who dares to let you walk around?”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched, and his face turned red, even for someone as shameless as him. After all, he finally realized what a bloody brilliant genius Ye Qingtian was.

Even Lil’ Purple couldn’t help laughing when she heard that. “Lin Yun, stand your ground. If you fail to hold on, your identity will be revealed.”

Lin Yun also knew he couldn’t step back at this moment, or his identity would have loopholes. Wearing an awkward expression, Lin Yun could only grit his teeth and reply, “Who doesn’t like beauties? Not to mention someone as beautiful as Senior Sister Bai. Don’t tell me you guys don’t have similar thoughts in your heart. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with liking someone, and I’m only more courageous than you guys.”

The surroundings fell silent as everyone became dumbfounded, looking at Lin Yun. Just how shameless was Lin Yun to say those words?

“Courageous? You’re just a lecher!” Luo Cheng said.

“If liking someone means bearing the scoldings from everyone in the world, I’m willing to do it. But I have done nothing wrong. If there’s something I have done wrong, it is that I shouldn’t have fallen for someone like Senior Sister Bai. After all, I’m an abandoned chess piece of the Ye Clan and known for being a piece of garbage within the Heavenly Dao Sect. How can I possibly be compatible with the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden?” Lin Yun’s tone sounded sorrowful and bitter.

No one could tell if his words were true, but it made many of Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples take pity on him. After all, Ye Qingtian was crippled by Senior Brother Zhang a year ago, and it was admirable that he dared to return. After all, everyone stronger than Ye Qingtian naturally wanted to give him a beating within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Bai Shuying’s pupils flashed with doubt. Looking at Lin Yun’s bitter expression, she recalled the poem he had recited when he left earlier. It did make some sense now, and this also made her take pity on him. But for some reason, something didn’t sound right somewhere.

Luo Cheng’s face had turned green from anger, and he roared, “Ye Qingtian, I have never seen someone as shameless as you before. That’s not what you said when you begged Senior Brother Zhang for forgiveness back then!”

Seeing that Luo Cheng was determined to bite onto him. He smiled weakly, “If I didn’t suffer the humiliation back then, how would I have changed after coming back? For the past year, I dreamt about returning to the Nether Orchid Courtyard every day, not to prove that I’m strong, but I just wanted to prove that I will take back what’s mine!”

As he spoke, he ripped open his clothes and revealed his chest. “Bai Shuying, everyone thinks I’m wrong, but I don’t care about that. If you think I’m wrong, you can stab me to death, and I won’t frown or dodge your blow.”

His determined gaze was filled with sincerity, and it had moved many people. But this made Bai Shuying bashful and furious at the same time. There were so many people here, so how could she stab him to death now, even if she wanted to? If she wanted to kill him, she would’ve done so a year ago, and she didn’t have to wait till now.

Lin Yun inwardly counted to three before tidying up his clothes. He smiled, “It looks like I have not fallen for the wrong person. Senior Sister Bai can’t bear to kill me, and that’s enough.”

He stopped at this point so that he could come down the steps and immediately turned to leave.

But Luo Cheng had no intentions of letting him go and roared, “Ye Qingtian, Senior Sister Bai is kind and can’t bear to kill you, but not me!”

When he was done, he drew his sword and arrived before Lin Yun. The speed of his sword shocked many people because Luo Cheng didn’t hold back his cultivation in this attack. Practically simultaneously, he drew his sword, which had already arrived before Lin Yun, and his attack focused on speed.

He was so fast that no one could respond in time, but Lin Yun’s sword was even faster than him. With a gentle clash, Luo Cheng’s sword was knocked away.

When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, a sinister gash appeared on Luo Cheng’s chest with blood splashing out. The dragon origin covering him couldn’t put up any resistance against Lin Yun’s sword. With that, Luo Cheng, who was at the third channel of the Profound Death Stage, lost.

Lin Yun soared to the sky. But before he left the Nether Orchid Courtyard, he couldn’t help looking back at Ye Xinyan, who went missing five years ago. But he was surprised when he turned around because he saw that Bai Shuying had also raised her head to look at him.

Her pupils were serene and deep. This made Lin Yun wonder if Bai Shuying fell for him. With an arc rising on his lips, he turned around and left without hesitation.
