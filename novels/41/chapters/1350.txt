Chapter 1351 - Ruthless (1)

“What’s going on?” Jiang Lichen, who recovered from his shock, soon discovered his own changes and felt unbelievable. With joy on his face, he excitedly said, “Pinnacle of the Lesser Elysium Core Realm? Oh my god, why is there so many saint elixir essences within my body? The saint elixir essences have accumulated within my blood, bones, astral energy, and violet palace?! Just what the hell is going on?!”

Jiang Lichen was so excited that he had no idea what was going on earlier, and this all felt too unbelievable to him.

The saint elixir essences accumulated within his body was equivalent to a hidden treasure. Just this alone had given him an unimaginable foundation, and this was why he was so shocked.

Saint elixir essences and pellets weren’t the same. Since they hadn’t been refined, the essence was pure, without any impurities. Furthermore, the saint elixir essences were refined by the Profound Wither Great Saint’s life-death dao, so there wouldn’t be any side effects. This was naturally a huge opportunity for Jiang Lichen.

But Lin Yun knew that Jiang Lichen’s aptitude was a little lower. If someone woke up earlier, that meant that their talent was lower. A brief moment later, Jiang Lichen recovered from his shock. When he looked at Lin Yun, he still couldn’t regain his composure and said, “Junior Brother Lin, what happened earlier? Why did I obtain such a huge opportunity after just one night of sleep?”

“You guys were restricted earlier. When the herbal field crumbled, the remaining saint elixir essences entered your bodies and are now stored within them,” replied Lin Yun calmly. After a brief pondering, Lin Yun didn’t choose to hide the Great Saint Origin and continued, “I have already obtained the Great Saint Origin.”

“So the Great Saint Origin is the opportunity that the Profound Wither Great Saint gave us?” Jiang Lichen wasn’t surprised that Lin Yun had obtained the Great Saint Origin. After knowing that the saint elixir essences came from the Profound Wither Great Saint, he was endlessly grateful and gave several bows in mid-air.

He definitely had his own opportunities, since he could become the chief disciple in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but it was incomparable to the opportunity that he had obtained this time. If his opportunities were a droplet of water in the past, then this opportunity was a vast ocean.

“Junior Brother Lin, thank you,” said Jiang Lichen while sending a serious look at Lin Yun. He knew that this opportunity was brought to him by Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun didn’t have to bring them with him, and he knew what Lin Yun meant by bringing them with him. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

In response, Lin Yun merely smiled and was pretty happy at that. Not long later, Feng Zhang, Liu Qingyan, Lil’ Red, Ye Ziling, and Su Ziyao woke up, and all of them were shocked by the opportunity that they had obtained without an exception.

When Su Ziyao recovered, she turned to look at Lin Yun as if she was asking something with her gaze. Lin Yun nodded his head. The two of them didn’t have to speak to understand what each other was saying.

“What happened to me…” Ye Ziling was shocked to discover that she had reached the pinnacle of Lesser Elysium Core Realm. But that wasn’t all. She found many sword dao comprehensions within her mind. What left her even more shocked was the fact that she discovered that her Divine Dragon Sword Physique and Radiant Snow Clan’s bloodline have perfectly fused together.

“Junior Brother Lin, what happened?” Ye Ziling asked.

Lin Yun had no idea what to say because Ye Ziling’s opportunity was clearly different from the others. Or rather, her opportunity had far exceeded everyone else’s. Her opportunity didn’t come from the Profound Wither Great Saint. He suspected that Ye Ziling’s opportunity might be related to the other person who came; however, even Lin Yun had no idea who that was.

Then again, it was all just speculation. Since Lin Yun wasn’t too sure about it, he couldn’t answer Ye Ziling’s question.

“There have been conflicts between my Divine Dragon Sword Physique and Radiant Snow Clan’s bloodline. This is why they were both sealed by the Radiant Sword Saint when I was young. As a result, I could only use a small portion of the Radiant Snow Clan’s bloodline, until my father undid the seal not too long ago. But it was still hard for the two of them to fuse together…” Ye Ziling said in an unbelievable tone. “Back then, Senior Radiant Sword Saint said that this was something that even he couldn’t resolve, and yet they have actually fused together now?”

Lin Yun was also surprised to hear that it was the Radiant Sword Saint who sealed the Divine Dragon Sword Physique and Radiant Snow Clan’s bloodline in her body. So, just how strong did the person have to be to perfectly fuse the two?

“Hehe. Senior Sister, looks like we have to call you the Divine Radiant Dragon Queen, now.” Feng Zhang joked, and everyone else also congratulated her. They all knew that this was a rare opportunity, and they could tell that Ye Ziling was very happy about the fusion of the Divine Dragon Sword Physique and Radiant Snow Clan’s bloodline.

“I have already reached the Elysium Core Realm.” Lin Yun looked at everyone with a brief pause before he smiled, “And I’ve also refined an origin saint rune.”

Upon hearing that, the smile on the faces of Jiang Lichen and the rest disappeared. They all had their own opportunities, but it was nothing compared to Lin Yun. The more they thought about it, the more they felt that the world was unfair.

“An origin saint rune?” Ye Ziling and Jiang Lichen were both surprised because they knew that an origin saint rune wasn’t something that you could just find anywhere. They didn’t think that even the Profound Wither Great Saint could take out an origin saint rune for Lin Yun to refine.

Suddenly, Ye Ziling’s eyes lit up, and smiled. “That monk!”

Nodding his head, Lin Yun replied, “There was a Golden Crow Plume Feather sealed within the stone tablet with a Golden Crow Saint Rune on it.”

Hearing that, Jiang Lichen and the rest had their mouths wide open and couldn’t utter a single word. If that monk knew what was in the stone tablet, he would probably die from regret right away.

“If I run into Qin Cang now, I should be able to defeat him,” said Lin Yun calmly, and his words shocked everyone once more. They all knew that Lin Yun wasn’t someone who boasts, and since he dared to say those words, this meant that he should be confident about it.

After all, Lin Yun never said that he could defeat Qin Cang before. Seeing that Jiang Lichen and the rest were used to the shock that Lin Yun revealed, Lin Yun smiled, “Don’t feel sullen. The saint elixir essences stored within your bodies are a super foundation. Within a year, you guys should be able to reach the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. On the other hand, I don’t have any saint elixir essences within my body.”

Although they knew that Lin Yun was comforting them, Jiang Lichen, Feng Zhang, and Liu Qingyan were still very happy when they heard that.

“Lin Yun, your cat seems to have obtained an opportunity as well. It seems to be cultivating right now.” When Jiang Lichen saw Lil’ Red seated like a human, cultivating some sort of cultivation technique, he couldn’t help smiling.

“Lil’ Red is a little stronger than you guys right now,” replied Lin Yun.

“How is that possible? I can use one hand to fight…” Jiang Lichen immediately voiced his unhappiness. After all, he was the senior brother there, so how could he not be comparable to a mere cat?

But when Lil’ Red heard what Jiang Lichen said, it suddenly opened its eyes and pushed a paw out. When its black paw landed on Jiang Lichen’s chest like an ancient dracoape, Jiang Lichen threw out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying away.

When he got back on his feet and looked at Lil’ Red, Jiang Lichen’s eyes were filled with shock. His injuries weren’t serious, and he could feel that Lil’ Red had gone easy on him. But it was simply too humiliating that he was actually sent flying away by a cat when he was the chief disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

Seeing this, Lil’ Red shook its head as if it was saying that Jiang Lichen was too weak.

“This cat is too despicable!” Jiang Lichen roared.

But when Lil’ Red threw a glance at Jiang Lichen and wanted to reach out with its paw once more, Jiang Lichen quickly hid behind Lin Yun and apologized, “Lord Cat, I’m sorry!”

“Hehe!” Lil’ Red grinned before tugging its paws together on its chest.

This instantly made everyone laugh before Su Ziyao asked, “Lin Yun, how long have we been here?”

“Three days,” replied Lin Yun after a brief ponder. The flow of time there was different from the outside world, and staying half a month there should be equivalent to three days in the outside world.

“Time for us to head out,” said Su Ziyao. Since Lin Yun had already obtained the Great Saint Origin, then there was no need for them to keep staying within the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda.

“Lin Yun…” Su Ziyao looked at Lin Yun.

But before she could even finish, Lin Yun already knew what she wanted to say. Holding onto her hand, Lin Yun smiled with confidence flashing across his pupils. “It’s fine. There is no doubt that there will be a battle between me and Qin Cang. I didn’t fear him even when I was at the Empyrean Realm, not to mention that I'm already at the Elysium Core Realm. He’s definitely not my opponent.”

“I believe you,” said Su Ziyao.

“Let’s go!” They then proceeded to leave this place. When they went out, they noticed that everyone had already left the pagoda, but this was also because they didn’t have a choice. After all, the pagoda would devour their vitality for every moment they stayed there, and not even a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert could last long, not to mention them.
