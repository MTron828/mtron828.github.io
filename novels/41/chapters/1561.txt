Chapter 1562 - Sudden Change

“Let me go!” Liu Xu’s legs were kicking around. He was shocked beyond words. He thought his cultivation was close to Ye Ziling, and he wouldn’t lose to anyone in the same cultivation with his sword aura, astral energy, and strength combined. Even if he lost, he shouldn’t have lost so terribly by having his neck choked and lifted by a woman. This was completely different from what he had expected. Liu Xu’s face blushed red, and his pupils were filled with reluctance. After all, he hadn’t shown his full strength yet.

The other sects’ disciples were shocked. They knew that Liu Xu might lose, but they didn’t think that Liu Xu would lose so terribly. Everything happened so fast that they hadn’t recovered from their shock. Just a moment ago, Liu Xu was mightily standing on the moon. But in the next second, he was grabbed by his throat by Ye Ziling.

“Thunderfrost Intent!”

“Ye Ziling grasped the rare Thunderfrost Intent!”

“Snow and lightning are two extremes, so I wonder how she managed to grasp them. This is really shocking!” Ye Ziling had shocked everyone with the Thunderfrost Intent.

“Let me go, you bitch! Fight me fairly if you have the guts!” Liu Xu cussed.

Ye Ziling initially intended to let him go, but a cold light flashed across her pupils when she heard that and threw Liu Xu out. When she threw Liu Xu out, snow and lightning surged behind her and formed into a dragon that clashed with Liu Xu.

This attack immediately knocked Liu Xu out, and he could no longer fight. This was shocking; no one could believe that she was a woman.

“How dare you!” Luo Yuan’s face turned dark as a terrifying aura swept out. He even reached out, wanting to grab a hold of Ye Ziling. He was at the pinnacle of the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, the strongest under the golden generation. He had condensed dragon origin in the first pulse.

He was a lot stronger than Ye Ziling. If he grabbed Ye Ziling, everyone could imagine her outcome.

Lin Yun, who was initially idling at this gathering, suddenly opened his eyes with boundless killing intent surging within his pupils. Before Mu Xueqin could react, he had already landed on the stage. But the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was faster than him and he swept his gaze over the main pavilion.

When he swept his gaze over, the gigantic palm suddenly shattered, causing Luo Yuan to groan as he turned to look at the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord. The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord smiled and warned, “This young lad is a little impulsive, and this is your final warning.”

Suffering a loss, Luo Yuan could only smile. “I’m sorry about that. I was a little impulsive and will punish myself with one cup.”

His action was swift, not giving Mu Xueqin a chance to react. But when he raised the cup, the smile on his face had disappeared, and his face was dark.

I’ll return this tenfold! Luo Yuan gritted his teeth. The masked man didn’t say a word; but after a long time had passed, his voice resounded, “You help me, and I’ll help you.”

Putting the cup down, Luo Yuan smiled as he looked at Mu Xueqin. “Lady Mu won’t blame me, right?”

But Mu Xueqin coldly looked at him without saying a word. The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord moved to prevent the matter from blowing up. So she knew she couldn’t go after Luo Yuan, but she also couldn’t take this lying down.

“I could have avoided it.” Ye Ziling smiled, looking at Lin Yun, who held her hand and took several steps back. Her smile had stunned the other sects’ disciples.

“Let’s go back first.” Lin Yun nodded, and they returned to the Sword Sect’s pavilion. This scene was captured by Ye Ziyun, who wore a playful smile.

“When did you grasp the Thunderfrost Intent?” Lin Yun asked.

“Not long ago. I’ve been stuck in a bottleneck, but the fruit you gave me helped me greatly.” Ye Ziling replied.

Lin Yun already had his speculation, and he smiled when Ye Ziling confirmed it. He was naturally happy that he could help Ye Ziling. After all, she was one of his best friends.

The gathering didn’t stop there. The other sects’ disciples came out one after another. There were the Emerald Jade Manor’s Ning Feng, Profound Valley’s Tang Jing, Vajra Monastery’s Cang Yun, Thunder Sect’s Zhang Jin, and Dugu Yan. They were Elysium Core Realm geniuses in the Ancient Barren Domain, and anyone could imagine that they could make it into the top thousandths on the Elysium Core Ranking.

Sword Sect’s Jiang Cheng also fought once, displaying the strength of a saint disciple once again, and quickly resolved his opponent within ten moves.

“Nangong Yan, do you dare to fight me?” A disciple of the Emerald Jade Manor, Chang Feng, suddenly said and looked in the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s direction. He was also a bladesman and had won once for the Emerald Jade Manor. So he wanted to challenge Nangong Yan, who had become much stronger.

“You’re not qualified.” Nangong Yan said, without bothering his arrogance.

This placed Chang Feng in an awkward position, and he raged, “We’re just sparing. Even if I can’t defeat you, I’m not qualified to fight you?”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Nangong Yan, don’t push it!” Ning Feng furrowed his brows.

“Alright, then. I’ll fulfill your wish, since you want to be humiliated.” Nangong Yan smiled. As he landed on the stage, he coldly looked at Chang Feng, “I’ll let you have the first three moves.”

This was equivalent to giving Chang Feng three moves to perform, which also spoke about his self-confidence. His words made everyone’s eyes light up since they were both seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm geniuses. Was the difference between them that huge?

Chang Feng’s face turned red, but he maintained his composure despite his rage. He accumulated his attack for a long time before swinging his sword. Since his fourth-grade wind intent combined with his pinnacle Spiritual Blade Intent, he was confident that he wouldn’t be inferior even when facing Firmament Blade Intent.

But his attack missed. It couldn’t even touch the corner of Nangong Yan’s clothes. Nangong Yan didn’t use any unique movement technique, he just casually took several steps. Every step he took would step where Chang Feng’s blade intent was at its weakest.

But Chang Feng swung his sword again without landing on the ground. As a dazzling blade ray flashed, Nangong Yan easily avoided the former’s attack. It might seem dangerous, but that blade ray didn’t even slice off a strand of his hair.

“Ha.” Nangong Yan wore a mocking smile that made Chang Feng even more furious.

Chang Feng didn’t hesitate to execute his ghost spirit martial technique and unleashed a boundless blade aura. This blade couldn’t be avoided, but his attack still missed Nangong Yan. This scene left everyone shocked, and they couldn’t utter a word.

Chang Feng was also dumbfounded, with beads of sweat covering his forehead. He became so nervous that he couldn’t hold his blade well because Nangong Yan suddenly blurred within his senses when he unleashed his last attack. He already expected that his attack would miss, but he didn’t think that he would miss in this manner. Thus, he lost all of his confidence with his legs trembling when Nangong Yan didn’t even draw his blade.

“Hmph. Get lost. I don’t wish to injure you.” Nangong Yan said, and he didn’t even open his eyes to look at Chang Feng.

“I’m sorry. I’m indeed not qualified to fight you.” Chang Feng said with shame, covering his face.

“It’s good that you realized it now.” Nangong Yan idly said as he dug his ear. But then, a peal of laughter echoed that made Nangong Yan open his eyes to look at where the laughter came from. It was from the masked man, the mysterious disciple of the Profound Sky Sect, Yi Xuan.

“What are you laughing at?” Nangong Yan said coldly, his killing intent unleashed.

“I’m laughing because I want to.” The masked man replied.

“I bet you’re ugly because you don’t even dare to show your face.” Nangong Yan countered.

“As long as you’re happy.” The masked man wasn’t bothered by Nangong Yan’s insult at all.

At this point, everyone could smell the gunpowder brewing between them. No one expected that the masked man would suddenly laugh at Nangong Yan. Was it because Nangong Yan was too arrogant and made the masked man unhappy?

“I’m done drinking. So it’s time for me to have some fun.” The masked man stretched and continued in an idle tone, “Saint Lord, if someone can sweep through all the disciples here, does it mean that person can enjoy the baptism alone?”

His words were like a bomb that stumped everyone because he was too arrogant. Even the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was briefly stunned before he replied, “There hasn’t been a precedent in the past. But if you can sweep through everyone, you can enjoy the baptism alone.”

“Very well, then!” The masked man replied, and he turned to Nangong Yan. “You seem very strong. So let’s start with you, then!”

With a flash, he appeared on the stage, brimming with invincible confidence. Nangong Yan might be strong, but his aura was much weaker than this masked man.

“You’re looking down on me?” Nangong Yan coldly questioned.

“Don’t take it to heart. It’s not targeted at you because everyone here is garbage. If someone like you can act like you’re an expert, this gathering will be a boring one.” The masked man replied. “Since that’s the case, let’s end it quickly because we’ll only be wasting time by carrying on.”

His words left everyone dumbfounded. But when they came to their senses, they were all filled with rage. Does this person want to challenge everyone present? Where did he get that arrogance from?

“Nangong Yan, teach him a lesson!”

“Nangong Yan, don’t cower!”

The next moment, everyone yelled out, supporting Nangong Yan in teaching that masked person a lesson. Ever since the Heavenly Pool Gathering was hosted, there hadn’t been someone so arrogant. Not even Jian Jingtian had said such words in the past.
