Chapter 1952 - That Won't Do

The Flower Burial Sword was trapped in the saint aura released by the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf and couldn’t break free no matter how it struggled. The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf burst into weird laughter, its gaze becoming cold.

Lin Yun immediately sensed a wisp of danger with his Azure Dragon Sword Heart, and his control over the Flower Burial Sword was interrupted.

As the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf raised its paw, it reached out, and the incoming swords all shattered, and saint aura manifested into a wolf’s claw, wanting to tear Lin Yun apart.

But Lin Yun’s hands joined together as a Blue Dragon and Azure Dragon coiled around him. But the two dragons could only briefly it blocked before they exploded, and Lin Yun was forced to retreat a hundred meters before falling to his knees, throwing out a mouthful of blood.

“That was really dangerous!” Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips with shock as he looked at the dissipated claw.

If it weren’t for the Azure Dragon Sword Heart that warned him beforehand and immediately went into defense, the claw would’ve killed him, and he knew that he had to maintain his composure.

He might seem like he was evenly fighting with a Quasi-Saint, but there was a massive difference between the two. He attacked the other party over a hundred times but couldn’t inflict heavy injuries on the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf.

But the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf only needed to land one attack to heavily injure him, even if he had two saint physiques.

“It’s no wonder why you dare to eat my Blood Rune Fruit. It turns out that you’re not bad yourself.” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf approached, looking at Lin Yun as if it was looking at a dead person. This was normal because it could easily kill enemies at the Profound Death Stage, and it would be impressive if they could survive its attack.

The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf held onto the Flower Burial Sword and looked at the moon in the sky before it sneered, “Don’t worry about it. There are still three days before the full moon, so I won’t kill you now. Come here!”

The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf reached out with its claw as though it was trying to grab an ant.

Lin Yun fell onto one knee, his face becoming pale, but he was terrifyingly calm. He could even hear his own heartbeat, and his injuries were swiftly recovering.

When the claw was four feet away from him, Lin Yun finally made a move. He raised his hand, and the Black Tortoise Chains flew out. The nine chains swiftly tangled around the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf’s right hand, with nine-colored lightning flames igniting on the chains.

This immediately made the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf scream as the chains dug into its flesh. The nine chains were like serpents traveling on its paw and swiftly surrounded the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf like venomous pythons.

“N-No…” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf was terrified by this move. It was trapping the Flower Burial Sword with its left claw, so it couldn’t react in time against the chains before they wrapped around its right claw.

The nine serpents opened their jaws and bit on the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf’s head, causing the wolf to let out an excruciating scream and let go of the Flower Burial Sword.

“Sword!” Lin Yun released the Black Tortoise Chains and grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword when he clenched his fist. The sword had long formed a deep connection with him, and it was like a part of his body. When Lin Yun grabbed his sword, he swung out a sword arc.

The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf felt threatened and wanted to retreat, but this sword followed behind him, with the surrounding space crushing down on it. Even if it was a Quasi-Saint, it was still being crushed by the surrounding distorted space, and the sword arc left a wound on its neck with blood splashing out.

After swinging his sword, Lin Yun retreated by ten steps, but he still suffered the counterattack of the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf. He took a wolf claw head-on and was sent flying back, throwing a mouthful of blood, and the sword flew away.

But Lin Yun was surprised as he looked at the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf holding onto its neck. He discovered that he inflicted a heavy injury on the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf.

Then again, Lin Yun was also injured, and his bones cracked. He noticed that a Quasi-Saint didn’t seem as terrifying as he imagined, and he immediately decided with a cold light flashing within his pupils.

A pair of golden crow wings with a wingspan of nearly twenty feet unfolded behind him. The wings were shining with saint runes, and Lin Yun relied on the wings to stabilize himself and stopped in mid-air.

The incoming wind blew on him as the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella appeared in his hand. He previously used this to slay a Saint Lord while at the Dragon Pulse Realm, and he initially planned on summoning the Sovereign Constellation with his life on the line.

Although he managed to slay the Saint Lord, he also suffered dire consequences, with his dragon pulses nearly being destroyed and becoming a cripple. But he did not need to take it that far against a monarch demonic beast; he just had to activate the glory spirits on the umbrella. Even so, it would exhaust the majority of his vitality.

“Oh, Azure Dragon…” Lin Yun’s face changed when he wanted to open the umbrella. A sword intent restricted the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, and he couldn’t open it. He immediately figured out what was going on, and the corner of his lips twitched. He wondered if Ye Guhan was really his senior brother and not an enemy wanting to kill him. “This is too much…”

In this brief moment of delay, the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf let out a roar with its saint aura rippling out like blades.

Lin Yun quickly responded by folding his wings to block the incoming attacks. When he reopened his wings, he threw out a mouthful of blood and landed a few hundred meters away. The wings were covered in holes, and Lin Yun stowed the wings back into his body before sitting down. He closed his eyes to circulate the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art, allowing a blue aura to course throughout his body from the Blue Dragon Bone.

On the other hand, the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf took a few steps back, relying on this brief moment to recover from its injuries. When it closed its eyes, the surrounding wolves dashed over.

But the Flower Burial Sword released a sword vibration and coiled around Lin Yun, clashing with the surrounding demonic wolves, and allowing Lin Yun to peacefully heal his injuries.

In the end, a demonic wolf lost its patience and dashed forth. But the moment it leaped into the air, a hole appeared on its forehead, and it collapsed to the ground while the Flower Burial Sword returned to Lin Yun’s side.

A few demonic wolves dashed over, wanting to take Lin Yun’s life while he was healing his injuries. But without exception, a hole appeared in their heads as they fell to the ground. The sword vibration the Flower Burial Sword released instantly intimidated the surrounding demonic wolves, and none dared to move.

The Flower Burial Sword seemed even more ferocious than the demonic wolves, loyally protecting Lin Yun and slaying anyone who dared to step within ten-foot radius.

This immediately terrified the demonic wolves and they could only coil around while occasionally bare their fangs at the Flower Burial Sword.

But provoking the Flower Burial Sword only killed them as the few wolves who bared their fangs were ripped to pieces before returning to Lin Yun’s side, not allowing the other demonic wolves to come after Lin Yun.

The Flower Burial Sword began to circle Lin Yun, provoking the surrounding demonic wolves. This immediately intimidated the demonic wolves, who could only roll on the ground to duck the attacks. Just like that, a sword had intimidated the entire wolf pack.

The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf opened it’s eyes a crack, and its body trembled when it saw the scene. It released a mighty growl filled with rage and prestige.

Hearing the alpha wolf’s growl, the surrounding wolf pack mustered their courage and approached.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

At this moment, Lin Yun opened his eyes with a cold light flashing through his pupils, and a Netherflower bloomed beneath him. As Lin Yun joined his hands together, he pushed his hands forth. The Netherflower exploded with countless petals flying out under the Flicking Divine Finger, turning into swords flying out and slaughtering the surrounding wolf pack.

Letting out a snort, Lin Yun stood up and soared to the sky with the Flower Burial Sword appearing beneath his foot, “Let’s go!”

When the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf opened its eyes, Lin Yun was dashing over to the Flower Burial Sword. The alpha wolf roared, “You can’t escape no matter where you go, and I’ll kill you no matter what!”

Meanwhile, Ye Guhan sat on the mountain, playing with the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella in his hand. Looking at Lin Yun, he wondered what kind of monster this junior brother was, and he smiled, “You never fail to surprise me.”

If he didn’t make a move and stopped Lin Yun from using the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, Lin Yun might’ve killed that Quasi-Saint monarch demonic beast by now. But he stopped Lin Yun because he wanted him to temper his Sword Heart.
