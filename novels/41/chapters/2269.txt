Chapter 2270 - I'm The One Who Determines!

Three dazzling saint radiances shone as Huang Jingyu, Liu Yunlan, and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord arrived. They descended from the sky and were three thousand meters away from Lin Yun. They could easily reach him in the blink of an eye at this distance.

But Lin Yun couldn’t afford to be distracted since he was focused on treating Ji Zixi, removing the seal on her heart. The moment anything went wrong, Ji Zixi’s life would be in danger, and Lin Yun would also suffer from the phoenix bloodline’s backlash.

“Young Master Li, we meet again.” Huang Jingyu smiled as he looked at Li Feibai. Just as he spoke, Liu Yunlan and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord separated, locking onto Lin Yun.

Li Feibai smiled, “As he said, this mask can only fend off gentlemen, not villains.”

Huang Jingyu closed the fan in his hand. He was secretly observing Lin Yun to see if he could be distracted. He smiled, “Gentlemen and villains only exist with one thought, and only the victor will be remembered. Take Flower Burial, for example; he was the victor when he snatched the Divine Blood Fruit, so who would care about a gentleman or a villain as long as he can leave this place alive?”

Li Feibai smiled, “You are really good at changing concepts.”

“Haha!” Huang Jingyu smiled as he gave the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord a look. The latter then raised his hand and pushed forth with lightning descending from above Lin Yun and Ji Zixi. A blurred figure began forming in the clouds as a lightning spear appeared in his hand.

“You’re shameless!” Li Feibai cursed as she gave a slap with the back of her hand. A lotus appeared beneath her that shot out a flaming beam of lightning, destroying the thunderclouds in the sky. When the thunderclouds were ripped apart, a colossal figure was revealed with lightning shining brightly.

“Take him down first!” Huang Jingyu’s eyes lit up. He confirmed that Lin Yun couldn’t be distracted now, which was a good opportunity. They might not have had any chance if Lin Yun and Li Feibai had joined hands. But it was different now that Lin Yun couldn’t be distracted.

“Don’t probe anymore in case the little princess is affected,” Huang Jingyu said as he charged at Li Feibai. He only wanted to use Ji Zixi in exchange for the divine flame fragment with no intention of killing her since it wouldn’t benefit him.

“Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing,” the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord smiled as a long spear appeared in his hand. The colossal figure in the sky soared behind some clouds and blurred once more.

“Lightning Chains!” The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord roared and the colossal figure in the sky reacted by forming the lightning chains.

After the chains descended to the ground, they plunged into the ground after Li Feibai dodged the incoming attacks. Li Feibai tried slamming her palm against the chains, but there was no reaction from them.

“Even if Lin Yun tries, his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent can’t damage my Lightning Chains,” the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord said with pride. After becoming a second-stage Saint Lord, his strength had transformed. Before Li Feibai could respond, a saint blade appeared in Liu Yunlan’s hand as he charged.

Li Feibai was calm while stretching her hand out from her wrist. Her fingers became as flawless as jade before she used her fingers as a sword to clash with Liu Yunlan, leaving behind spatial ripples in the air when they clashed.

Liu Yunlan’s blade technique was powerful, and Li Feibai couldn’t find any flaws even though she didn’t use her full strength. Furthermore, Li Feibai had to dodge the Lightning Chains, which placed her in a passive position.

“Fighting two and not falling into a disadvantage, this Li Feibai is tough to deal with.” Not far away, Huang Jingyu soon judged Li Feibai’s strength. As a genius from one of the Eight Imperial Clans, Li Feibai was truly extraordinary. This was under the condition that she didn’t bring out her Sovereign Constellation. If she brought out her Sovereign Constellation, even the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord and Liu Yunlan might not be able to block her.

But Huang Jingyu soon came up with a countermeasure. He raised the back of his hand towards Lin Yun and Ji Zixi and the Sacred Moonlight Ring in his hand began to shine brightly under the darkness. A bright moon appeared above Huang Jingyu and formed into a beam of light that shot forth.

Lin Yun opened his mouth with beads of sweat appearing on his forehead as his murderous intent became violent.

“Focus.” Li Feibai had long noticed this, so she blocked the beam of light. But a brief moment later, Li Feibai’s face changed. The beam wasn’t terrifying, but the great yin energy began to freeze her body. Even with the lotus beneath her feet, her speed was slowly becoming stiff. At the same time, several Lightning Chains descended from the sky.

Li Feibai tried to dodge several times, but a chain pierced through her chest the third time. Shortly after, the chains shot into the ground.

“Heavenly Note Moon Lock!” Huang Jingyu took the opportunity of this moment to use flute music that came from the moon above him to suppress her. The moonlight was like a prison that flew down, restricting Li Feibai’s area.

This shattered Li Feibai’s mask and she threw out a mouthful of blood. She became furious as a rage of flames began to blaze in her eyes, “You guys are too much!”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

With a single thought, the Sovereign Constellation descended with a terrifying aura spreading out. This made the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord let out a groan and take a few steps back.

Li Feibai pulled the chains as flames spread over, soon covering the chains in flames. At this moment, Li Feibai looked like an enraged Flame Dragon that was charging at the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord. This made the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord retreat a hundred meters before throwing out a mouthful of blood.

“Sovereign Constellation, we’re seeing it again.” The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord was filled with emotions. They saw it before when the Divine Blood Fruit appeared and yet they were still shocked after seeing it again.

Li Feibai basked in the saint radiance as a powerful aura swept out. When Li Feibai waved her hand, the prison formed with moonlight shattered and Huang Jingyu crossed his arms together. The Sovereign Constellation was a boundless golden ocean with a lotus on it, the Eternal Azure Lotus.

The commotion caused by the Sovereign Constellation was huge and attracted everyone’s attention, including those fighting for the divine flame fragment.

The Astral River Saint Lord heaved a sigh of relief. He had long paid attention to Ji Zixi’s situation. Three holy lands had besieged him, and he had the divine flame fragment in one hand. That’s why he couldn’t reinforce Ji Zixi. But since Li Feibai possessed a Sovereign Constellation, she should be safe, not to mention that Lin Yun was also around.

“I’ve been waiting for this!” Huang Jingyu released his hand and a bead that was blazing with crimson flames flew out from his interspatial bracelet, emitting a terrifying baleful aura. This was the Blood Flame Pill that was refined by the Blood Flame King with divine blood and his saint origin.

Huang Jingyu didn’t hesitate to swallow this pill. His eyes had become crimson as his saint energy started to rise, instantly making a breakthrough. His saint energy continued to rise till he became a fourth-stage Saint Lord. But that wasn’t all. His saint energy had become terrifying, and he even possessed some abilities of the Blood Crows.

This made Li Feibai frown because Huang Jingyu was slowly breaking free from her control. The two soon fought, but Li Feibai couldn’t do anything to Huang Jingyu even after bringing out her Sovereign Constellation. Huang Jingyu’s trump card had exceeded her expectations.

“That’s not all!” Huang Jingyu laughed as he took out a flag blazing with crimson flames. He didn’t hesitate to toss the flag over to Li Feibai.

When the flag exploded, all of the Blood Crows’ resentment that the Blood Flame King had refined flew out and tangled around Li Feibai.

“Rising Moon!” Huang Jingyu roared as he raised the Sacred Moonlight Ring with a bright moon blooming that caused Li Feibai’s Sovereign Constellation to become dim.

“Liu Yunlan, are you still going to just watch?” Huang Jingyu was having difficulty restraining Li Feibai’s Sovereign Constellation, so he roared at Liu Yunlan, who was watching from the side. He had long noticed that Liu Yunlan hadn’t brought out his full strength during the fight, so he flared up after seeing this.

Liu Yunlan sighed and raised his blade before changing over, leaving many wounds on Li Feibai’s body with his Astral Blade Intent. There were lingering flames on her wounds that were fatal.

At the same time, lightning gathered to form a spear in the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord’s hand before he took out the Glory Saint Artifact, the Golden Thunder Flag. As the thunderclouds rumbled, he joined forces with Huang Jingyu to suppress Li Feibai’s Sovereign Constellation.

“Lady Li, you should give up. It’s not worth risk your life for someone you just met.” Liu Yunlan said.

“I don’t need you to poke your nose into my affairs!” Li Feibai might seem weak, but her gaze was determined. She glanced at Lin Yun and saw that the latter had beads of sweat on his forehead. Even Lin Yun was holding on, so why would she give up?

“It’s not worth it…” Liu Yunlan said with doubt in his eyes. He couldn’t comprehend why Li Feibai was putting her life on the line.

“I’m the one who determines if it’s worth it!” Li Feibai said.
