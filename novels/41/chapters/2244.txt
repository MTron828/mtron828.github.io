Chapter 2245 - Dragon Jade Flame Lotus (2)

“Open a path for me!” Huang Jingyu said.

“We’ve been waiting for the young master’s orders!” The ten-odd Saint Lords from the Ming Cult summoned their constellations with a sun and a moon beneath them, and they pushed their palms forth.

“Universal Reversal!” As the Saint Lords roared, a sun and moon appeared in the sky that converged. When they unleashed their attacks, the entire space was shaking. This caught ten-odd Saint Lords by surprise as they threw out a mouthful of blood and were sent flying out.

But that wasn’t all. The Ming Cult’s Saint Lords roared with their hands clasping together, and a massive ‘Ming’ word appeared above the valley. Under the pressure they gave off, many Saint Lords’ faces became ugly as they realized it was tough even for them to move a step.

“It’s the Sun-Moon Saint Canon!”

“The Ming Cult has made a move!” Many people were shocked with fear because they didn’t expect the Ming Cult’s Saint Lords to be so powerful when they made a move.

Taking this opportunity, Huang Jingyu dashed forth, heading towards where the Divine Blood Fruit was with a confident smile.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The Divine Blood Fruit had some intelligence, so it released its seven-colored radiance by instinct when it sensed that someone was approaching.

“Pathetic!” Huang Jingyu didn’t even place it in his eyes since he was a Saint Lord at the second-stage. Under the Sun-Moon Saint Canon, he unleashed a punch that shone brightly like a sun, shattering the seven-colored radiance.

But just when he was about to grab onto the Divine Blood Fruit, a blade ray shattered the sun and moon and headed towards Huang Jingyu. This made Huang Jingyu take a few steps back and turn around to look at Liu Yunlan, who made a move.

“Liu Yunlan, it looks like you’ve greatly improved during your time here,” Huang Jingyu smiled as he looked at Liu Yunlan.

“Likewise, likewise,” Liu Yunlan smiled. The two might seem relaxed, but they were waiting for each other to show their weakness. They might have allied, but even blood brothers would compete for something like the Divine Blood Fruit.

A lightning bolt descended when Liu Yunlan and Huang Jingyu were facing off. This lightning bolt contained an ancient aura that made the surrounding space freeze.

In just a brief moment, the Divine Blood Fruit was dragged over by a mysterious force. When Liu Yunlan and Huang Jingyu turned around, they saw Heavenly Kui Saint Lord smiling, “Big Brothers, I guess I’ll be taking this Divine Blood Fruit.”

An indigo flag appeared in the hands of the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord with several terrifying divine runes engraved on it. The entire space was restricted with a gentle wave as the Divine Blood Fruit was being dragged over.

“The Golden Thunder Flag!” Huang Jingyu and Liu Yunlan soon discovered that this was the Fourspirit Glory Saint Artifact of the Myriad Lightning Sect, the greatest trump card of the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord. They didn’t even bother acting any more and brought out their trump cards right from the start.

Just when the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord felt that the Divine Blood Fruit would be his, a beam of light shot over that shattered the surrounding lightning. When the beam of light landed on the flag, the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord took a few steps back.

When he raised his head, he noticed a fine crack on the Fourspirit Glory Saint Artifact, and his face changed. When he raised his head, he saw Huang Jingyu hovering in the air with a dazzling ring on the index finger of his right hand.

“The Divine Moonlight Ring!” The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord exclaimed. This was a Sovereign Saint Artifact of the Ming Cult, and the gem embedded in the ring was the Divine Moonlight Stone. But this should be an imitation, and it was more suitable to call it the Sacred Moonlight Ring. Otherwise, there was no way Huang Jingyu could use the actual thing with his cultivation.

But even if it was an imitation of the Divine Moonlight Ring, the power was a little terrifying.

“Come back!” As moonlight gathered in his palm, Huang Jingyu waved his hand, forming a vortex that was swiftly pulling the Divine Dragon Fruit over.

“Divine Sun Bell!” He reacted as though he had predicted this and pushed his left palm out. The sun began to form into an ancient bell in his palm.

The blade ray unleashed by Liu Yunlan had shattered, and the bell still had power left as spatial cracks appeared in the space while the bell tried to suppress Liu Yunlan.

Although the fight between the three was intense, the Saint Lords from their holy lands had a rapport as they scattered, surrounding the three to prevent anyone from interfering.

When the Saint Lords, with their life span running out, saw this scene, they were furious. They had lived for at least hundreds of years if not thousands, but they could only watch as three juniors competed for the Divine Blood Fruit. They didn’t even have the qualifications to compete for it.

The only person who stood a chance was Qu Wushuang, but he frowned when he saw this scene because he didn’t know how to interfere.

“It has come to an end here!” After several exchanges, Huang Jingyu held the upper hand in the fight and grabbed the Divine Blood Fruit.

Although the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord and Liu Yunlan were unconvinced, they had an agreement beforehand, so they could only give up on the Divine Blood Fruit.

“Don’t worry about it. I won’t treat you guys badly; we’re brothers,” Huang Jingyu smiled. He fulfilled his promise by taking out some treasures to compensate the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord and Liu Yunlan for not fighting further for the Divine Blood Fruit.

Then again, there was no way the value of those treasures could be compared to the Divine Blood Fruit.

“Congratulations, Brother Huang.” As the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord and Liu Yunlan came over, they squeezed out a smile and cupped their fists together.

“Congratulations to us!” Huang Jingyu laughed and said, “Brothers, why don’t we look and see what’s so special about this Divine Blood Fruit?”

Huang Jingyu opened his palm with the Divine Blood Fruit resting within. Under Liu Yunlan and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord’s closer observation, they felt that this Divine Blood Fruit was profound, as if it contained dao. Even the saint runes on the leaves contained powerful daos that were fatally attractive to any Saint Lord.

The Divine Blood Fruit was struggling within Huang Jingyu’s palm, but it was restrained by an invisible power from the Sacred Moonlight Ring, preventing it from escaping.

“This Divine Blood Fruit is really special. Just the leaves alone are enough for us to experience a great boost in our strength,” Liu Yunlan said with flames blazing in his eyes.

“Don’t worry about it. I’m not a stingy person. You two can have a leaf each,” Huang Jingyu smiled after hearing the hidden meaning in Liu Yunlan’s words.

With the Divine Blood Fruit in his hand, the leaves were nothing in comparison, not to mention that there were five leaves left, and he still benefit the most at the end. So Huang Jingyu was naturally in a good mood.

Following Huang Jingyu's words, Liu Yunlan and Heavenly Kui Saint Lord’s faces improved.

“Let’s leave this place first in case a variable appears,” the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord said as he looked around vigilantly.

“Who dares to be presumptuous with three of our holy lands joining forces?” Huang Jingyu wasn’t bothered with what the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord said. But despite saying that, he was still careful since he planned to subdue the Divine Blood Fruit completely before storing it in his interspatial bracelet.

The Divine Blood Fruit was still struggling, so Huang Jingyu had to teach it a lesson to behave.

Right then, a flaming lotus appeared in the sky with a golden radiance blooming that shattered the ‘Ming’ word in the sky.

When the ‘Ming’ word was destroyed, a flaming dragon flew out from the lotus. Before those from the Ming Cult could respond, the flaming dragon opened its jaws, devouring the sun and moon.

When the sun and moon were devoured, the sky became terrifyingly dark, and no one could see anything even after pouring their saint energy into their eyes.

This made Huang Jingyu’s face change before he could sense a hand stretching out in his direction from the darkness, which naturally made him furious. He roared, “You’re courting death!”

When the two palms clashed, the other party let out a painful groan, and Huang Xuanyi didn’t even know who had attacked him before he took several punches on his body. Amidst the darkness, the three who were smiling just a moment ago immediately became distrusting as they moved against each other.

“Stop!” Huang Jingyu felt something wasn’t right and poured most of his saint energy into the Sacred Moonlight Right.

As an explosion took place, the valley was lit up once more.

The Ming Cult’s Saint Elders also came to their senses as they combined the sun and moon once more with a ‘Ming’ word appearing in the sky, and the flaming dragon that devoured the sun and moon shattered with light returning once more.

“My Divine Blood Fruit!” Huang Jingyu looked at his hand, and noticed that the Divine Blood Fruit that he was holding just a moment ago was nowhere to be seen, so he turned to look at Liu Yunlan and Heavenly Kui Saint Lord unhappily.

But the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord and Liu Yunlan were also furious because they were attacked in the darkness earlier.

“Haha! The three holy lands of the Eastern Desolation don’t look so impressive, after all.” A burst of laughter resounded as everyone turned to see a youth holding onto a Divine Blood Fruit. As he turned around, a lotus appeared beneath his feet with stars shining in his eyes while he overlooked everyone present.

“The Dragon Jade Flaming Lotus!” Many Saint Lords recognized the origin of that lotus, and their faces changed.
