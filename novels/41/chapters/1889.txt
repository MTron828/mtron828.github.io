Chapter 1890 - An Ant Trying To Shake A Tree

When the sounds of dao echoed, everyone could hear it as it rumbled like thunder. It was weird because none of them felt discomfort, even though the sound was loud. It felt as though they had gained enlightenment, and many of them gained enlightenment on the spot, including the peak masters on the altar.

When everyone came to their senses, they all had shock on their faces. “How is this possible?! The sound of dao! That’s the sound of dao!”

“A blue radiance, this has never appeared before. But the Heavenly Dao Sacred Flame is extinguished…” Those who felt that Ye Qingtian wouldn’t gain any acknowledgment were stumped, looking at the direction of the altar with their eyes wide open.

The golden and silver fishes manifested by the Heavenly Dao Sacred Flame had disappeared, but a blue aura was spreading out. This left Saint Elder, who was on the altar, dumbfounded. He was experienced and had participated in hundreds of conferring ceremonies. But he had never seen this before.

The blue aura soon manifested into blue flames before soaring to the sky. A brief moment later, it dyed the clouds within a hundred miles of radius in blue. When the blue radiance shone down, all the buildings around the Heavenly Dao Altar were dyed blue, and this phenomenon soon alarmed the entire Heavenly Dao Sect.

When the disciples of the two peaks, three courtyards, and one hundred and eight peaks saw this scene, they raised their heads to look at the sky with shock filling their pupils.

“Blue clouds covering a hundred miles… What sort of phenomenon is this…?” This phenomenon was shocking and even attracted the attention of those Saint Elders in seclusion.

A person hovered above the Nether Orchid Courtyard, looking at the altar’s direction. This person was naturally one of the three Sword Saints within the Eastern Desolation, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. She wore a white robe that made her look pure and clean. She was also emitting a faint radiance that concealed herself, since she didn’t want to attract too much attention. Only the peak masters and Saint Elder on the altar could see her.

“We greet Martial Aunt!” All the peak masters bowed, but only Saint Elder nodded his head.

But the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint didn’t reply. Her gaze was on the altar before turning to Lin Yun. She muttered, “Ye Qingtian?”

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master quickly said, “Reporting to Martial Aunt, that brat is a newly conferred saint disciple of my Indigo Thunder Peak.”

“I know him. He’s pretty talented, and I noticed he has grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent some time ago,” said the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

When the peak masters heard what the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, they were shocked because they didn’t expect that Ye Qingtian had long caught the attention of the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master nodded his head with a gratified expression. On the other hand, the Wind Origin Quasi-Saint wore an awkward expression, unable to accept this result. But before the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, he didn’t dare to say a word. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was one of the three Sword Saints of the Eastern Desolation, and she had a high position within the Heavenly Dao Sect, far beyond Quasi-Saints like him. After all, what the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said was no different from praising him.

“Martial Aunt, what’s that blue aura? Why have we never seen it before?” A peak master asked.

“You guys don’t have to care about that. Long Yun, what do you think of him?” Long Yun was the name of the Saint Elder, and no one dared to call him by his name, aside from the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. This was because he had a high cultivation, even amongst all the Saint Elders.

“Before Martial Aunt came, he said that he’d beat me up in the future if I dared to deny his qualification to become a saint disciple,” said Saint Elder Long Yun.

“Oh?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint smiled. “I believe that’s something he would say, and only he would dare to say something like that.”

She didn’t stay for long and left swiftly.

“What’s wrong with Senior Brother?” Chen Feng asked. He naturally didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to cause such a huge commotion.

As the sounds of dao became even louder, it soon manifested into a dragon roar that rippled like a shockwave. Three blue flames appeared, manifesting into blue dragons that entered Lin Yun’s violet palace. Shortly after, a powerful aura swept out from Lin Yun’s body, and the blue radiance manifested into an energy sphere that enveloped him.

Densely packed runes appeared on the blue energy sphere with swords hovering in the sky around the sphere. Shortly after, the runes and swords entered his body. Before anyone could come to their senses, Lin Yun made a breakthrough in his cultivation, reaching the pinnacle third channel of the Profound Death Stage.

“What grade are those three blue dragon sacred flames considered as?” The Indigo Thunder Peak exclaimed. “A phenomenon of this level is simply unheard of. How did that brat manage to do it?”

He and the other peak masters were also dumbfounded as they looked at Saint Elder Long Yun.

“The fourth grade and it can be comparable to the Saint Sovereign Flame,” Long Yun explained.

The eyes of the Indigo Thunder Peak Master flickered. He felt that Saint Elder knew something, and the grade of Lin Yun’s sacred flame wasn’t just at the Saint Sovereign Flame. It might involve some secrets, so Saint Elder wanted to handle this matter in a low profile. Thus, the Indigo Thunder Peak Master no longer asked questions about it.

The entire Heavenly Dao Altar was covered in an uproar, and this scene excited everyone from the Indigo Thunder Peak. Chen Feng yelled, “Three strands of blue dragon sacred flames. This proves our senior brother is the best in today's conferring ceremony. Only he can be considered a true genius!”

Those who belittled and yelled for Ye Qingtian to get lost earlier were filled with envy. Even if they didn’t know the origin of the blue dragon sacred flame, even an idiot could tell that it wasn’t on the same level as Chen Jun’s Saint Sovereign Flame.

As for Luo Cheng, he looked no different from a clown at this moment after provoking Ye Qingtian when he had obtained a mere Saint Flame.

“Damn it! What’s going on?! It’s simply unheard of!” Luo Cheng couldn’t help cursing. He had only obtained the acknowledgment of a Saint Flame and could barely be considered outstanding. But he was nothing compared to Ye Qingtian.

Does this mean that I will be suppressed by Ye Qingtian in the future? Thinking about it, Luo Cheng’s face became ugly.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

One year ago, Ye Qingtian was still a piece of garbage, but now he had to look up to him. How could Luo Cheng possibly accept this? It didn’t matter if he could accept it. As Lin Yun slowly opened his eyes, Luo Cheng hoped that this was a dream, hoped that everything would disappear when he reopened his eyes.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun could sense countless gazes from the surroundings, leaving him shocked. He had no idea what was happening, but he discovered three strands of the blue dragon sacred flames within his violet palace. Every single strand of the flames contained an ancient and powerful aura.

“Blue dragon sacred flames? Which grade is this considered?” Lin Yun was shocked and raised his head to look at the altar. Saint Elder had long left, and the Indigo Thunder Peak Master nodded his head with a smile before leaving.

“Weird, why is there sword intent hidden within the sacred flames? It doesn’t feel connected to the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword.” Lin Yun looked at Heavenly Sword Mountain and Dao Sword Mountain. The two mountains were massive, but he couldn’t sense any response from the sacred flames within his body against those two mountains.

“Ye Qingtian, pretty impressive!” Chen Jun said with a cold expression. He thought his result was the best with two strands of Saint Sovereign Flame, but everyone instantly forgot him after Lin Yun obtained his sacred flame.

“Hehe. Senior Brother, he only obtained the Saint Sovereign Flame. He even declared he would step on you after the conferring ceremony with his newly obtained Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.” Chen Feng smiled, and the other Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples also looked at Chen Jun with mockery. They were previously afraid of Chen Jun, but no more.

Chen Jun’s face froze because he initially planned on leaving, but he was forced to stand out now. He initially wanted to briefly provoke Ye Qingtian before leaving, but he never expected those from Indigo Thunder Peak would immediately expose him.

“Oh?” Lin Yun turned to look at Chen Jun with a playful smile.

The corner of Chen Jun’s lip twitched, and he coldly said, “Ye Qingtian, don’t think too highly of yourself. We have both obtained the Saint Sovereign Flame and possess the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. Not to mention that my cultivation is higher than yours.”

“Why don’t we have some fun, then?” Lin Yun replied in an indifferent tone.

“Sure. I’ll fulfill your wish, since you’re asking to be humiliated. Half a month from now, on the Windcloud Stage.” Chen Jun sneered. To be honest, Chen Jun was a little afraid, so he set the date to half a month from now. It was mainly because the phenomenon created by Ye Qingtian was too terrifying, and Chen Jun had no confidence.

But it would be a different story half a month after he got used to his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent and asked for advice from the Dao Yang Palace’s senior brothers.

“Why wait half a month? I’m allowing you to humiliate me now,” Lin Yun smiled.

Chen Jun immediately lost it and coldly said, “Ye Qingtian, I’m at the fifth channel of the Profound Death Stage. If I use my full strength, I’m afraid I might not be able to hold my strength back!”

When he was done, he released his cultivation and unleashed a terrifying aura, with hundreds of sword auras coiling around him. Under the empowerment of his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, the sword ray he gave off became dazzling.

The faces of all the disciples present changed, and they quickly retreated with fear lingering within their pupils.

“You’re nothing but an ant trying to shake a tree!” Lin Yun raised his hand and pushed forth, instantly causing all the sword auras to collapse, and Chen Jun was sent flying back. When he crashed against a stone pillar again, his outcome was even more severe, with his face becoming pale and falling on his knees.

“This is impossible…” Chen Jun raised his head to look at Lin Yun with fear reflected within his pupils. He never expected that Ye Qingtian would be so strong. If his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent was a sapling, Lin Yun’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent was like a towering tree.

This scene also left everyone dumbfounded, unable to figure out what happened. Chen Jun, who was at the fifth channel of the Profound Death Stage and grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, was easily defeated by Ye Qingtian.

“Just what happened in the past year?” Bai Shuying’s pupils shone brightly. She felt that Ye Qingtian was deep and unfathomable.
