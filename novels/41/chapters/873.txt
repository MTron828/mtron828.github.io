Chapter 874 - Huge Harvest

All it took was one sword for Lin Yun to decapitate Nangong He. Dumbfounded, everyone looked at Lin Yun with fear. They all began to wonder if Lin Yun was a monster. Otherwise, how could he possibly be so powerful?

Nangong He could fight ten Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses when he was in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. So they couldn’t imagine how powerful he was after reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm. But Lin Yun only used one sword to kill Lin Yun. Furthermore, no one could see how Lin Yun attacked.

Along with Nangong He’s death, the phenomenon that shrouded half the city slowly dissipated. When Nangong He’s corpse fell to the ground, everyone recovered from their shock.

“H-how did he do it?”

“What happened?”

“How did Nangong He die?”

“Holy shit. Can someone tell me what just happened?” Their voices were filled with fear and they desperately wanted to get away from Lin Yun. After all, they were all frozen in mid-air for just a brief moment before the tables were turned.

Just a moment ago, Nangong He’s arrogant words filled the entire plaza. Now, he was a headless corpse.

“Damn it!” Yu Haotian’s pupils were filled with rage as he couldn’t believe this scene. When Nangong He used the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm, he had prepared his Phaseless Demonic Art once again. He thought that Lin Yun would be killed. But now that Nangong He was slain by Lin Yun, he had to hide his killing aura once more. His hands were trembling because he couldn’t calm his rage.

Fang Shaoyu and the others also had disbelief on their faces before they rejoiced. As for the three who pledged their loyalty to Nangong He earlier, their faces became pale and they quickly soared into the sky. They were trying to get away from Tang Yan as quickly as possible.

Meanwhile, Tang Yan’s mouth was wide open as countless eyes fell on him. The gazes were full of pity, especially since Tang Yan mocked Lin Yun when Nangong He came out. Now that Nangong He was dead, there was no one who felt worse than Tang Yan. His lips had turned purple and all the color left his face.

Lin Yun swept his glance on Tang Yan who fell onto his knees uncontrollably.

“Lin…Brother Lin, please spare me. I can be your lackey, and I guarantee…no, a piece of garbage like me isn’t worthy of being your lackey. You can cripple me and leave me be. I can tell you the secrets of my Flamecloud Realm…” Tang Yan kept rephasing his words in hopes of living.

But the moment Tang Yan was done, Lin Yun flicked his finger and a sword ray pierced through Tang Yan’s forehead. When Tang Yan’s body hit the ground, his eyes were filled with reluctance.

“Lin Yun, don’t take it too far. This is only one of the cities being controlled by our Flamecloud Realm. Nangong He isn’t even the strongest in our Flamecloud Realm!” Seeing how Lin Yun killed Nangong He and Tang Yan, the remaining Flamecloud Realm cultivators started to threaten Lin Yun.

“Haha. None of you wanted to spare me earlier, so why should I spare you?” Lin Yun spoke indifferently as the killing aura in his eyes grew even denser. The Flamecloud Realm was already his enemy with Nangong He and Tang Yan’s death. The next time they met, they definitely won't let him off. Lin Yun wasn’t stupid enough to be compassionate at this moment.

Drawing his sword once more, Lin Yun unleashed a sword ray that emitted a terrifying pressure. The pressure caused the six remaining people from the Flamecloud Realm to circulate their origin energy with their teeth gritted.

With his spiritual sword intent in greater mastery empowered by his Immortal Azure Dragon Aura, his sword ray enveloped the entire city and cast a layer of radiance on the entire city. When Lin Yun was done swinging his sword, the six geniuses from the Flamecloud Realm died.

“Greater mastery of spiritual sword intent!”

“My heavens! Grasping the greater mastery of spiritual sword intent before reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm?”

“No wonder he can kill Nangong He in a single attack. The sword intent he’s giving off is simply too terrifying, not to mention that he even merged his azure dragon aura into it.” Everyone could clearly see Lin Yun’s strength now. It finally made sense why Nangong He died so easily.

When they looked at Lin Yun this time, they were full of fear. Even the faces of Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan changed because they didn’t know that Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent had become so powerful.

When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, a small figure flew out and gathered the interspatial pouches of the six Flamecloud Realm’s geniuses. Lil’ Red chuckled as it brought the interspatial pouches to Lin Yun. After receiving the cultivation technique, it had become a lot faster. But fortunately, it still knew that Lin Yun was the boss.

Lin Yun nodded his head at Lil’ Red, who chuckled and dumped the interspatial pouches. Each of the interspatial pouches contained thousands of astral pellets, which made many people stare with envy. There were also many other treasures, but not the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm that Lin Yun was looking for.

“There’s two more,” said Lin Yun as he looked at Tang Yan and Nangong He’s corpses.

Lil’ Red gently jumped off Lin Yun’s shoulder before grabbing the interspatial pouch that belonged to Tang Yan. In the end, Lin Yun found an astronomical sum of astral pellets in the pouch, which took him a long time to go through. Based on his estimation, there were at least 20,000 astral pellets.

All of the cultivators in the plaza couldn’t help feeling jealous. Even Yu Haotian’s pupils flashed with hesitation because he never expected there to be so many. As soon as Lil’ Red poured out everything in Nangong He’s pouch, no one could stay composed. There were at least 100,000 pellets that were piled into a small mountain.

“Holy shit!”

“Isn’t the Flamecloud Realm a little too terrifying to have so many astral pellets?” The astronomical sum left everyone dumbfounded as their eyes were glued to the mountain of pellets.

But they knew that everything belonged to Lin Yun, including their treasures. They couldn’t imagine this harvest at all. Lil’ Red chuckled and grabbed a bunch before shoving them into its mouth. Then, Lil’ Red picked up a jade slip and looked at it briefly before tossing it towards Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun grabbed the jade slip, he placed it against his forehead. He had finally obtained the greater fortune martial technique, Flamecloud Incinerating Palm.

Fortune martial techniques are divided into eight stages and come from ancient divine runes. Fire runes had four stages - white, azure, purple, and gold. Every single stage meant that the power of the fire runes would become even more powerful. When one gathers four runes, the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm can tear apart the mountains and rivers.

Lin Yun’s heart was full of joy because the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm was a secret technique just like the Flicking Divine Finger. It was extremely powerful. Tang Yan hadn’t cultivated it to proficiency, so it was a lot weaker than Nangong He’s version.

Lin Yun knew that if Nangong He’s attack hit him, it would be a lot more troublesome than Tang Yan. This was why Lin Yun ended the fight quickly with his sword.

Nangong He was truly powerful since he reached the limit of the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. However, that limit was nothing to Lin Yun. If Nangong He’s limit was 10, then Lin Yun’s limit would be at least 50 because of the two sword sutras.

Then again, it was impossible for Nangong He to survive the combination of Lin Yun’s Immortal Azure Dragon Aura and Spiritual Sword Intent. After all, Lin Yun’s sword intent was comparable to a martial intent in the third stage. So even Lin Yun has no idea where his limit was.

“Is that the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm?” Fang Shaoyu and the others walked over.

“Yeah. You guys can comprehend it if you want.” Lin Yun nodded his head and handed the jade slip over. They all had shock on their faces and they hesitated for a long time before giving up. A fortune martial technique required high comprehension, not to mention that they didn’t have a cultivation technique that paired with it.

They knew that they would be a waste of time to comprehend it. Furthermore, if the Flamecloud Realm knew that they learned the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm, it would bring them trouble.

In the end, Lin Yun didn’t force it and took the jade slip away.

“Haha. Brother Lin, what is that? Let me take a look at it as well.” Yu Haotian naturally had a huge wave in his heart when he saw Lin Yun hand the jade slip to Fang Shaoyu and the others. There was a high possibility that the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm was recorded on the jade slip. Plus, Lin Yun was more generous than he thought. Since Yu Haotian was also from the Profound Amber Realm, he also wanted to try his luck.

Lin Yun could even put up with Fang Shaoyu, so there was a chance that he might not put their conflict in his heart. Naturally, Yu Haotian thought that he could make use of this opportunity. But when he saw that Lin Yun had no intention of handing it to him, he gritted his teeth and stepped forward with a smile.

When Lin Yun heard Yu Haotian, he merely looked at Yu Haotian and asked, “Do you think you’re qualified?”
