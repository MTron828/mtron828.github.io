Chapter 1576 - Drinking With The Saint Lord

The Sword Sect’s foundation would continue to increase as long as he was alive? Was the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord hinting at something? Lin Yun began to brainstorm upon hearing what the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said, and he realized that he couldn’t see through this person.

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was an expert in the Ancient Barren domain and could compete with the sect masters of the eight powerful sects. He could be considered in the strongest batch beneath Tian Xuanzi and the Radiant Sword Saint.

The Heavenly Pool Manor had always kept a neutral position, but he could tell that the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was on his side based on those words. Previously, the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was also leaning towards the Sword Sect’s side during the gathering.

“Saint Lord, what do you mean by that?” Lin Yun asked. He didn’t like someone beating around the bush with him.

“As I said, I hope you can stay alive.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord replied.

“Who wants to die? I naturally want to keep on living.” Lin Yun smiled, holding onto his chin.

“Swordsmen aren’t afraid of death, and I want to tell you to make the right choice between yourself and the Sword Sect,” smiled the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord.

When Lin Yun heard that, his face sank because the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord’s words were like a sword stabbing his heart. The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was telling him not to die when protecting the Sword Sect?

Connecting that to what the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said previously, Lin Yun instantly knew what he meant. The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was telling him not to stand out when the Sword Sect faces destruction, and he could always make a comeback as long as he was alive.

“The Saint Lord thinks that the Sword Sect will be destroyed and my master won’t make it?” Lin Yun asked.

“Let me ask you. Who’s stronger between Tian Xuanzi and your master?” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord asked a question instead of answering Lin Yun.

“My master should be stronger.” Lin Yun replied.

“What’s the connection between the Sword Sect’s destruction and your master?” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord smiled.

Lin Yun was stumped when he heard that because he had never considered that before. He thought the Sword Sect’s current situation was linked to his master’s life and death. But what the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said had overturned that logic.

“Who are you?” Lin Yun asked, looking at the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord. He suddenly felt that the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord had just become a stranger. He felt that the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord had a bigger origin than he had imagined.

“Let’s put that aside for now. Let me ask you, how is the Profound Sky Sect threatening the Sword Sect?” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord asked.

“Tian Xuanzi.” Lin Yun replied; he didn’t even have to consider that question. Tian Xuanzi was a genius who completed the Profound Sky Canon, and it wasn’t an exaggeration to call him the strongest genius beneath the Nine Emperors.

“Then, do you know why the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t kill him when he was young?” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord asked.

“One of the Eastern Desolation’s Three Sword Saints will make a move on a junior? I don't believe that.” Lin Yun shook his head.

“Then, let me ask you. What will you choose between your reputation and the sect?” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord asked again, and his question made Lin Yun fall into a dilemma.

“Not to mention that as a swordsman, you must be true to your heart. The Radiant Sword Saint doesn’t have to kill Tian Xuanzi. He has other alternatives, such as crippling him. The Radiant Sword Saint was once invincible in the Ancient Barren Domain, and even the Nether Divinity Ancestor was heavily injured by him, back then.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said. “I can tell you that if the Radiant Sword Saint knows that Tian Xuanzi might threaten the Sword Sect, he won’t hesitate to make a move. Rules don’t have much effect on an expert like him, and the reason why he didn’t is that he can’t!”

“What do you mean by that?” Lin Yun asked after a long pondering.

“Come with me.” The two walked on the clouds and landed on a boat with wine on it. After they sat down, the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord looked at Lin Yun, “This is the Dragon Clan’s brew, the Fingertip Sand. It’s not inferior to the Millennium Flame you obtained in the Heavenly Path.”

Trying a cup, Lin Yun realized that the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord wasn’t exaggerating.

“Hey, how does this old man know the Millennium Flame in the Heavenly Path? Be careful not to be bluffed by him.” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded, and Lin Yun instantly became alert despite not showing anything on his face.

“All the powerful sects in the Ancient Barren Domain have a backing. Otherwise, they would have been annihilated a long time ago.”

“Including the Sword Sect?”

“Including the Sword Sect. There was a Sword Alliance in the Dark Era, and the Sword Sect was a huge figure in this alliance. But after the Skysolute City rose in the Sword Alliance, the Sword Sect’s presence slowly faded. Now, the Sword Alliance only has four giants, the Skysolute City, Hidden Sword Manor, Heavenly Dao Sect…”

“What about the Profound Sky Sect?”

“It’s obvious, but no one will talk about it openly.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord smiled.

“Boring.” Lin Yun indifferently drank the wine.

“Do you know why I’m telling you this today?”

“I don’t.”

“The Sword Sect won’t tell you about this because they want to return to becoming a holy land. But aside from being the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, you also have another identity!”

“What identity? Why don’t I know about it?”

“You don’t?” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord drank a cup of wine and said, “Didn’t you use the Profound Wither Key in the Dragon Transforming Pool?”

Lin Yun continued to silently drink wine.

“Your other identity is the Southern Emperor’s successor. The current situation of the Divine Dragon Era is related to the Southern Emperor’s death. If the Southern Emperor was still alive, the situation in the Kunlun Realm might’ve been different. Others only know that you’re a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, but why don’t you know that you’re also the successor of the Southern Emperor?” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said.

“Don’t talk nonsense. I only obtained the Profound Wither Key by luck, and I can give it to you if you want. I’m not the Southern Emperor’s successor.” Lin Yun smiled.

“What about that sword, then?” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord pointed at the Flower Burial Sword. “‘Drifting like the duckweed for half a lifetime to be wrecked by the cold-hearted rain; the life of the catkins was akin to an incense, withering with the wind. Flower Burial, burying both people and flowers alike.’ If that’s not enough, what about the Carefree 9 Swords?”

“Who the hell are you?” Lin Yun finally couldn’t maintain his composure.

“My identity isn’t important. I’m telling you all that because you have to stay alive, no matter what. Your life doesn’t only belong to the Sword Sect. You’re also the Southern Emperor’s successor. When darkness returns, you have an obligation.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said.

“Okay. I don’t care who you are. I’ll only ask one question. Will you help out if the Sword Sect is in danger?” Lin Yun asked.

“I won’t. I will only help out if you’re in danger.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord replied.

“You’re…” Lin Yun realized that he couldn’t see through this person and couldn’t figure out the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord’s identity. Why did the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord know about his experience on the Heavenly Path so well, along with the Southern Emperor’s inheritance?

“We’ve met before. I’ve seen you from afar on the boat back on the Heavenly Path. I also witnessed Feng Jue taking you away.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said. “Luo Qingxu was also under my orders to save you.”

“The Sacred Alliance!” Lin Yun finally knew that the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord's backing was the Sacred Alliance, the mysterious force that held the Heavenly Path. Or rather, the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord was a member of the Sacred Alliance, to begin with, and he now knew why the Saint Lord would take care of him at the gathering.

“Senior, my master can’t escape this ordeal?” Lin Yun couldn’t help asking.

“If it’s that easy to make it through, why would your master take the risk when his lifespan is about to end?” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord replied honestly.

“So, Senior thinks that the Sword Sect will be annihilated, and you want me to pull myself out of the vortex?”

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord fell into a brief silence before he replied, “You’re the Southern Emperor’s successor, and the Sacred Alliance won’t let you die. Believe me, if darkness returns, you and the other champions of the Heavenly Paths have an obligation.”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I’m a disciple of the Sword Sect. My sword will hold no meaning if the Sword Sect no longer exists.” Lin Yun calmly replied. “I’ve sworn before the monument and won’t let the Sword Sect down with the sword in my hand.”

As a swordsman, Lin Yun naturally didn’t fear death, not to mention his relationship with his master, Jian Jingtian, Mu Xuankong, Feng Jue, Ye Ziling, and many others. He and the Sword Sect were no longer separatable, and the Sword Sect was his home in the Kunlun Realm.

“But what can you do when the Radiant Sword Saint can’t do anything?” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord replied.

Lin Yun fell into a brief silence before he smiled, “My master once told me that it’s enough as long as I don’t let down the sword in my hand. The Sword Sect didn’t disappoint me, so I will not let down the Sword Sect. Not to mention that I don’t fear death as a swordsman.”

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord fell silent when he heard that. He had long expected Lin Yun to respond this way. He ultimately gave up persuading him, “You can leave now. Don’t tell anyone about my identity, and keep our conversation to ourselves.”

Standing up and cupping his hands together, Lin Yun replied, “Thank you for resolving my doubts.”

Looking at Lin Yun’s silhouette, the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord fell silent. He could feel that the chaos within the Ancient Barren Domain wasn’t far away, and this Ancient Barren Battlefield would be more brutal than before.

Raising his head, the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord looked in a certain direction because someone had been observing the gathering right from the beginning, and no one who caught his attention would have a good ending, regardless of whether it was the Radiant Sword Saint, Nether Divinity Ancestor, or Jian Jingtian.

That person was Tian Xuanzi, standing on a mountain, looking at the Heavenly Pool Manor.

“Master, I’m afraid no one will be able to stop Lin Yun from today onwards,” said Qin Cang.

“Your senior brother suffered on your behalf. Go to the Divine Dragon Empire and never return to the Ancient Barren Domain.” Tian Xuanzi smiled.

“Master?” Qin Cang asked with doubt on his face.

“I have already predicted this. There’s no way the Sword Sect can make a comeback. Not Jian Jingtian from back then, and certainly not Lin Yun. A holy land must be born in the Ancient Barren Domain, and no one can stop this. Anyone who tries to stop it will die, regardless of whether it’s the Radiant Sword Saint or the Nether Divinity Ancestor!” Tian Xuanzi smiled.
