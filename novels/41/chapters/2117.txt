Chapter 2118 - All Out!

Looking at the aggrieved expression on the Dragon Origin Great Saint, Lin Yun said helplessly, “Master, you didn’t ask me about it. You left without saying a word, and I only knew about it after you left.”

Lin Yun was stumped when he initially learned about it. If the Dragon Origin Great Saint had asked him about it, the latter wouldn’t have had to take such a huge risk. Seeing the Dragon Origin Great Saint crying, Lin Yun instantly knew that Ye Guhan was right. The Dragon Origin Great Saint probably suffered greatly during this trip to the Divine Dragon Grave.

The Dragon Origin Great saint was stumped before recalling that he really didn’t ask Lin Yun about it. He felt that the trip to the Divine Dragon Grave would be dangerous, so he went with the preparation to die. This was why he didn’t tell Lin Yun about it. It was mainly because he was worried, but he didn’t expect to cause such a misunderstanding.

This immediately made the Dragon Origin Great Saint feel awkward, before he awkwardly said, “Y-Yeah. I didn’t seem to ask you about it before leaving.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint wasn’t worried about it anymore. He looked at the Divine Blood Fruit and said, “With the help of the Divine Blood Fruit, there shouldn’t be any obstacles left for you to practice the Azure Dragon Divine Art. This is the key, but it’s not the answer. You previously forcibly merged your two Dragon Clan’s saint physiques with the Sovereign Dragon Seal, but it won’t last long and will also leave behind problems within your body. Luckily, you didn’t use it that much. Wait a minute…”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint suddenly stopped. His eyes lit up as he said in surprise, “Wait, the quality of this Divine Blood Fruit seems to be higher than the one I found in the Divine Dragon Grave. Did you obtain this on the Heavenly Path?”

Lin Yun nodded in acknowledgment.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“You didn’t tell Radiant about it?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint asked.

The Divine Blood Fruit was precious within the Kunlun Realm, and each Divine Blood Fruit would spark a fight amongst saints or even emperors. Aside from aiding the cultivation of saint dao, its greatest use was to extend one’s lifespan, which many cultivators highly desired. After all, there would be hope as long as one was still alive.

Lin Yun sighed, “I did, but my master told me he had already consumed one before, so this Divine Blood Fruit is useless to him.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint sighed, “Actually, lifespan doesn’t matter whether he can take that step out. Since his lifespan is ending, there’s also an advantage to it.

“Forget about it. Let’s not talk about it anymore. I’ll transmit the Azure Dragon Divine Art that I’ve completed to you.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint gave Lin Yun the completed Azure Dragon Divine Art and started explaining it to Lin Yun.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint was also a swordsman in his early years, but he changed to focus on his physique after receiving the Radiant Sword Saint’s suggestion. By cultivating his physique, the Dragon Origin Great Saint became a saint and eventually a Great Saint.

Thus, only a handful of people within the Kunlun Realm could compete with him when it comes to cultivating one’s physique. He didn’t hold back when teaching Lin Yun, and many pointers made Lin Yun’s eyes light up. But then he mentioned ‘taboo’ the most. After all, the process of acquiring a Divine Physique was taboo, especially the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. Its dangers were more terrifying than practicing the Divine Azure Overlord Physique that Lin Yun once refused.

The Azure Dragon Divine Art had nine levels, with a dragon tribulation starting from the second level. It was equivalent to a Divine Dragon’s tribulation.

“The Azure Dragon Divine Art is divided into three stages every three levels. The first stage is the Dragon's Physique, the second is the Dragon's Soul, and the third is the Dragon's Might. The three stages are gradual, and the first stage is the foundation, but it’s also the most important.

“The second stage is to temper your soul because the dragon physique will possess spirituality after possessing a dragon's soul. You will also be able to grasp many talents belonging to the Dragon Clan, such as the innate ability of the Azure Dragon, controlling wind and thunder.

“Lastly, the Dragon’s Might is more complicated because you need to manifest the oppression of a dragon, not just simply the aura. At that time, the Dragon Domain can empower your martial intent.

“If you reach the ninth level, the Azure Dragon Divine Physique will reach greater mastery. At that time, you can face Saint Realm experts head-on by relying on your physique alone without using saint dao. It’s so much so that you can easily crush them with a grasp. Even so, that’s not the end of the journey because you can still cultivate, and there’s no end before reaching the Divine Realm.”

Lin Yun was fascinated and shocked as he listened to the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s explanation.

“Since an acquired divine physique is so terrifying, does that mean that someone can also possess an innate divine physique?” Lin Yun asked. If the divine physique was so strong, those possessing an innate divine physique would far surpass their peers since they had already begun practicing their divine physiques from the womb.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint stroked his beard as he smiled, “The innate divine physique is rare, but it does exist. Let’s not mention ancient times, but there were people possessing innate divine physiques even after the Golden Era ended.”

“What?” Lin Yun was shocked because he never heard of it before.

“Everyone possessing an innate divine physique would have a smooth cultivating journey. Almost everyone would shine brightly in their era, becoming the most dazzling genius!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint continued with a grave expression, “But it’s not easy for them to be born because most die in the womb before they could even be born. An innate divine physique isn’t good, especially for the mother. The mother will have to endure a great test and torture. So no one would dare to give birth to a child who possesses a divine physique if they didn’t have great courage, so it may be a stillborn.”

Lin Yun was stumped upon hearing that because this was the first time he had encountered such secrets.

“Many people have tried various methods in ancient times, and some nurtured the child with the mother’s vitality for a hundred or a few hundred years just to safely give birth to a child possessing a divine physique. Even so, the chances are slim. There are ancient methods to ensure the safe birth of a child possessing a divine physique, but the cost is too high, and such ancient methods are long lost,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said, and his words shocked Lin Yun greatly.

There were pros and cons to everything in the world. Acquiring an acquired divine physique was like walking on thin ice, not to mention it even required a treasure like the Divine Blood Fruit. But the innate divine physique wasn’t that simple, either.

Lin Yun briefly pondered, but didn’t wish to possess an innate divine physique if he had a choice. It was better for him to gain control of his destiny. He could endure countless difficulties and dangers but couldn’t accept having his kin suffering for him.

“Here are one thousand, eight hundred kilograms of Black Tortoise Saint liquid. With the Divine Blood Fruit, it should be enough for you to reach the first level of the Azure Dragon Divine Art.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint handed Lin Yun the Azure Dragon Divine Art and Black Tortoise Saint Liquid.

“Where did you get so much Black Tortoise Saint Liquid from?” Lin Yun asked.

“Before I broke free, I visited the Flame Tortoise lineage’s vault. It was troublesome, but remember not to claim to be my disciple when you go to the Eastern Sea in the future,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint smiled.

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled. The Dragon Origin Great Saint probably emptied the entire vault.

“Remember. Stop immediately if something goes wrong because we can always try it again.” Before Lin Yun left, the Dragon Origin Great Saint said as he grabbed Lin Yun’s arm.

Lin Yun nodded then returned to the Indigothunder Peak. After taking a brief rest, he entered the Iris Secret Realm. There was still some time left before the Blue Dragon Record appeared, and Lin Yun wanted to try and obtain the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

If he could possess the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, he would be able to confront those holy sons who have grasped greater daos before entering the Quasi-Saint Realm, and he wouldn’t have to worry about facing greater daos. Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to start but strolled around the Iris Secret Realm first. He could see Lil’ Red attempting to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm.

The Lil’ Red already had sufficient accumulation and began to give off a faint saint radiance. It had reached the critical moment of making a breakthrough.

Afterwards, Lin Yun went to the Phoenix Tree to talk to Lil’ Purple before coming to the depths of the Iris Secret Realm and started practicing the Azure Dragon Divine Art.

Lin Yun already possessed the two Dragon Clan’s saint physiques, and his foundation was sufficient. As long as he refined the Black Tortoise Saint Liquid and merged the Divine Blood Fruit into his body, he could reach the first level of the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, the Dragon Blood Phase.

The three stages were further classified. The first level was called the Dragon’s Blood, the second was called the Dragon’s Bone, and the third was called the Dragon’s Meridians. Only by reaching the third level can one successfully master the first stage.

When Lin Yun’s hands faced each other, the Divine Blood Fruit hovered between his palms with a horrifying temperature spreading out from the fruit.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and closed his eyes, before activating the two Dragon Clan’s saint physiques. The two colored runes began to form a vortex around the Divine Blood Fruit. Whenever Lin Yun tried to direct the Divine Blood Fruit’s energy into his body, it would become taxing to his physique, not to mention that Lin Yun even had to bear the pain from the two saint physiques as they attempted to fuse.

The Blue Dragon Saint Physique and Azure Dragon Saint Physique were two entirely different energies, and Lin Yun had to fuse them.

Lin Yun’s clothes were drenched with sweat in just a few minutes. His flesh would explode and regenerate. Occasionally, it would even release a powerful thunderstorm energy or brimming vitality. He was in an unusual state because the Divine Blood Fruit would magnify the power of the Blue Dragon and Azure Dragon. There was a possibility that Lin Yun’s body would blow apart or flowers might grow on his body, using his blood as nourishment.

“Lin Yun, keep this in mind. You’re not trying to become anyone, but you will be yourself. Comparable to the Radiant Sword Saint or the Sword Emperor? That’s nothing but a joke! This path will be dangerous because swordsmen like us refuse to believe in fate. You must remember that there’s no one in the world you cannot surpass!” Lin Yun recalled what his master, the Radiant Sword Saint, said to him.

That was the path his master had been pursuing, and his master refused to compromise, even if his lifespan was coming to an end. His master could easily reach the Emperor Realm, but everything was meaningless to him if he couldn’t reach the same height as the Nine Emperors. The Radiant Sword Saint was using his life to teach Lin Yun the meaning of a swordsman.

“The path I want is the path of a Sword God. There are three thousand greater daos, but only one sword dao. I believe I can succeed! There are people I want to protect, and I have to walk my own path no matter what! I can succeed!”

Lin Yun gritted his teeth and fortified his will, preventing himself from falling into extreme emotions. If his emotions were affected, the Blue Dragon and Azure Dragon’s energies would lose balance, and he would die under the Divine Blood Fruit’s influence.

Seven days later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief, looking at the Divine Blood Fruit as he fell into deep thoughts. His first attempt failed, and his physique was greatly damaged. So he stopped for the time being according to the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s instructions.

“I still have a long time ahead of me…” Lin Yun sighed with his eyes shining brightly. But his blood was already boiling, and there was no reason for him to stop because time waited for no one. Thus, Lin Yun rested shortly before he attempted again.
