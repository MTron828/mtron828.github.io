Chapter 876 - Annoyance!

Lin Yun ran out of the city as he followed the trail of blood. But because he wasted some time in the crater, Yu Haotian had a head start. But Lin Yun was still calm because all he needed to do was land a fatal attack. So he had to be cautious and needed to ensure that the one who ran away was the real Yu Haotian.

Lin Yun only chased after Yu Haotian when he didn’t detect any vitality in the crater. Yu Haotian was injured to begin with, so there was no way he could run far away. If it was someone else, they would’ve already died hundreds of times. At this moment, Lin Yun was determined to kill Yu Haotian, not to mention that Yu Haotian had threatened him.

Lin Yun believed that Yu Haotian would do what he said. On top of that, he was even more concerned about being called a Sword Sect remnant. Yu Haotian clearly knew about their fate of battle, which meant that Lin Yun had to resolve the karma between the Sword Sect and the Indigomoon Elysium.

An hour later, Lin Yun finally caught up to Yu Haotian. Yu Haotian’s aura was extremely weak because of his heavy injuries and he was simply exhausting his foundation now. Sensing the torrential sword aura behind him, Yu Haotian gnashed his teeth, “Haha. Lin Yun, you’re really ruthless. I guess you have no intention of letting me off even when I’m in this state.”

Yu Haotian no longer had his usual grace and his body teetered on the edge of life and death. But when Lin Yun examined Yu Haotian carefully, he narrowed his eyes and came to a stop.

“Sword slave, don’t you want my life? Come and take my life if you dare!” Yu Haotian’s face became sinister as he looked at Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun didn’t move and sighed, “I can’t believe you managed to escape. Yu Haotian, you’ve become the bane of my existence. I bet if I take another step forward, you’ll suicide with this fake body of yours and drag me down.”

When Yu Haotian heard that, his smile disappeared and he asked, “How did you realize it?”

“You don’t have the purple flames in your pupils like before,” replied Lin Yun.

Yu Haotian was briefly stunned before he laughed, “Hahaha! You’re really cautious. Just thinking about you being my enemy sends a shiver down my spine. But it’ll be different the next time we meet!”

Purple cracks spread out on Yu Haotian’s skin as he finally exploded.

Lin Yun didn’t even budge. When he sheathed his sword, he was enveloped in a tornado that blew the shockwave away. When the tornado dissipated, a huge crater appeared before Lin Yun. The huge crater looked as if it had been created by a gigantic meteorite.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun now knew how Yu Haotian followed him. Yu Haotian wasn’t really hit by Terranean Destruction. Before his attack reached him, Yu Haotian had already left behind a fake body. But it was still dangerous because Yu Haotian would be killed if he failed. But such a treasure was also extraordinary as it must contain Yu Haotian’s blood essence and soul.

So this meant that Yu Haotian would be injured whenever the fake body exploded. Yu Haotian wouldn’t be able to recover anytime soon, but this wasn’t the outcome that Lin Yun wanted.

“My sword isn’t fast enough.” Lin Yun sighed. If his sword was a little faster, Yu Haotian would be dead by now. But there were no ifs in the world.

“I need to get back,” muttered Lin Yun as he calmed himself down.

Almost an hour later, Lin Yun returned to the plaza. When Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan saw Lin Yun come back safely, joy filled their faces.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because something didn’t seem right. Lil’ Red was standing in front of the pile of astral pellets with boundless energy surging within its body. In front of Lil’ Red were a few people who had lost consciousness.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun frowned.

Fang Shaoyu didn’t say a word as someone from the crowd took the lead, “Young Master Lin, you came back right on time. We were trying to retrieve the astral pellets that belong to us, but your pet injured many of us. You should discipline it well.”

Lin Yun glanced at the person who spoke. Lin Yun barely had an impression of the person because he was the first one to pledge loyalty to Nangong He. He was the reason why everyone else stood up to support Nangong He.

“Oh? So how many do you want to take?” Lin Yun asked.

Zhang Feng’s pupils flashed with greed as he smiled, “Just 10,000. The three of us were heavily suppressed by the Flamecloud Realm and we have to thank you for sticking up for us.”

When the others heard that, they became emotional. Lin Yun suddenly smiled and responded, “I’ve heard of greedy lions, but I’ve never heard of greedy dogs.”

The faces of the Zhang Feng trio changed because Lin Yun was publicly calling them dogs.

“Lin Yun, it’s only right for us to take the astral pellets that belong to us. You actually dare to humiliate us? How are you any different from thieves of the Flamecloud Realm?” Zhang Feng asked.

“If I remember correctly, the three of you wanted to be Nangong He’s dog. So how did I humiliate you?” Lin Yun looked at the three with a playful smile. His words instantly made their faces sink.

“Lin Yun, we’re taking the astral pellets no matter what. You’ve already offended us. If we’re willing, we can easily share this information with the Flamecloud Realm. Nangong He isn’t the strongest from the Flamecloud Realm, nor did he cultivate the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm to a high level.”

“Young Master Lin, you better think wisely.”

“We’re only taking 10,000 astral pellets. Don’t push it!”

The three of them had no hesitation to blackmail Lin Yun. Lin Yun might be strong, but he had just gone through a huge battle and might not be able to face the three of them. As long as one of them was alive, they would be able to seek the Flamecloud Realm. If that happened, Lin Yun would be dead.

Zhang Feng’s face sank as he spoke coldy, “Lin Yun, we’re the strongest from our respective realms. Your battle might seem easy, but how much strength do you really have left? We might not be able to do anything to you, but you won’t be able to do anything to us either!”

When he said that, those who clamored to follow after Nangong He instantly became tempted. There was no question that Lin Yun was strong, but Zhang Feng’s reasoning made sense.

“What Brother Zhang said is right. Don’t push it!”

“Let us retrieve our astral pellets!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“......”

Fang Shaoyu’s face changed when he saw this situation because he knew this wouldn’t end well. ZHang Feng became more confident as many people started supporting him. He was confident that Lin Yun was greatly exhausted after the battle, not to mention that Lin Yun even faced someone stronger than Nangong He.

Thinking about it, Zhang Feng’s smile grew eerie, “I changed my mind. We also want the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm. Only then will we be even.”

“That’s right, the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm too!” Huang Hu and Wei Qing’s eyes flickered when they heard that.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly because he was genuinely enraged. These three who wanted to be Nangong He’s dogs actually turned around to say that he was taking it too far.

Sensing the killing aura in Lin Yun’s eyes, Zhang Feng, Huang Hu, and Wei Qing stepped back and yelled, “Lin Yun, don’t take it too far just because you’re strong. We just want to take back what belonged to us.”

Grabbing onto his sword, Lin Yun sneered, “Well said. But what are you going to do if I take it too far?”

When Lin Yun drew his sword, three heads rolled onto the ground. So what if he took it too far? After all, he didn’t have the time to deal with clowns.
