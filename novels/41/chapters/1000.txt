Chapter 1001 - Torrential Demonic Light

Empowered by the Azure Dragon True Bone, Lin Yun’s attack destroyed the entire plaza while burying Yu Haotian in a crater covered with dust. No one could tell if Yu Haotian was still alive in the rubble. Who would have thought that Lin Yun’s attack was so dangerous and that his Azure Dragon Saint Armor was so strong?

“Is Yu Haotian dead?” No one expected Yu Haotian to die so quickly. But it made sense with the dangerous aura that Lin Yun was giving off. The crowd could tell that Lin Yun’s armor wasn’t simple as a terrifying aura came from its core.

Many people were looking at the core of the armor curiously. It gave them a feeling of uneasiness. Luo Chen spoke up, “Is that the opportunity above fortune? That armor is extremely weird and its power sends chills down my spine. Honestly, I can’t look at it for too long.”

Everyone had come to this palace for the opportunity above fortune. However, the opportunity fell into Lin Yun’s hands. Even Pei Xue’s eyes were flickering when she looked at Lin Yun. Even with her experience, she couldn’t confirm what the opportunity above fortune was. “What did Lin Yun experience in the inheritance palace?”

Deep in the crater, Yu Haotian’s mouth was dripping with blood. A deep hole could be seen on his chest as Lin Yun nearly pierced through his body. At this moment, Yu Haotian couldn’t believe his heavy injuries.

He couldn’t believe that the combination of the Divine Shadow Glove, Divine Glorymoon Fist, and Phaseless Demonic Art weren’t enough to defeat Lin Yun. Suddenly, the demonic spirit’s voice sounded out in Yu Haotian’s mind, “Brat, let me control your body.”

When Yu Haotian heard that, his face changed with reluctance, “Are we going to flee? Senior, I can still defeat him.”

“Leave? That brat possesses an Azure Dragon True Bone. That’s a rare treasure! Although it’s not as powerful as your Divine Shadow Glove, it can temper your body to be comparable to a true dragon. That treasure has more potential than your Divine Shadow Glove! This is a flawless physique that we’re talking about!” The greed filled in the demonic spirit’s voice sent chills down Yu Haotian’s spine, especially when he thought that the demonic spirit would choose to flee.

“Your foundation was too poor back then, so I wasn’t confident in defeating this brat. But it’s different now. Hurry up and give me control over your body. How long are you going to wait?” When the demonic spirit finished, Yu Haotian suddenly felt boundless energy surging towards his mind.

He never expected that the demonic spirit would forcibly try to control his body. He had maintained caution against the demonic spirit all along. So he didn’t panic and maintained his last strand of consciousness to resist the demonic spirit.

“What are you waiting for? This brat is full of your treasures. I’ll help you seize all his opportunities. Don’t you want to stand at the top of the Heavenly Path? This is a great opportunity right now…” The demonic spirit’s tone contained a hint of rage this time.

“Senior, are you sure that you can kill Lin Yun?” asked Yu Haotian.

“Hmph. It has been ten thousand years since I made a move. I could have killed him back then, but the price was too great. Just watch and see how I suppress him…” The demonic spirit snorted.

Receiving the demonic spirit’s guarantee, Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed decisively as he stopped resisting. After allowing the demonic spirit to control his body, the demonic spirit circulated the Phaseless Demonic Art.

“This aura again!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed. He knew that Yu Haotian wasn’t dead, but he was sure that Yu Haotian was heavily injured. The reason why he hadn’t moved was that he wanted to see what Yu Haotian was still hiding in his sleeves.

When a torrential demonic aura poured out from the crater, Lin Yun instantly recognized it. The aura was the same as when Yu Haotian fled. However, the aura was a lot stronger this time. Lin Yun became curious as to what was hidden in Yu Haotian’s body. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“What’s that? The Jairus Demonic Soul in the Divine Shadow Glove?”

“Doesn’t seem like it!”

“There’s something weird. That aura is similar to the silver moonlight from earlier, but it’s also an entirely different aura.” The torrential black demonic aura made everyone’s faces change. Who knew that Yu Haotian was still hiding trump cards?

Yu Haotian broke free from the rubble and soared into the sky with black radiance leaking out of his pores.

“Get over here!” Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed with demonic light as he reached out towards a figure a few thousand meters away. Before that person could respond, he had flown over to Yu Haotian’s hand as his body swiftly withered. Yu Haotian quickly recovered from his injuries, which scared everyone.

“Hahaha! This is how you should use the Phaseless Demonic Art!” Yu Haotian laughed as he tossed the corpse away. Instantly, everyone retreated even further. Even Luo Chen’s group felt scared. The essence of a Heavenly Soul Realm expert was devoured just like that?

Indigomoon Sutra? Blood Devour Demonic Canon? Lin Yun had no changes on his face as he recalled his experience in the Profound Amber Realm.It seemed like Yu Haotian’s actions were similar to what was described in the Blood Devour Demonic Canon. Was this still Yu Haotian?

“It’s just a piece of dried fish. What are you guys so shocked about?” Yu Haotian sneered before he started to examine Lin Yun as though he was looking at a delicacy. “You’re the main course. You can barely be considered great nourishment after making me wait for so long…”

A torrential demonic aura soared into the sky with layers of black clouds as a massive figure took form in the clouds. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw a black demonic moon hanging in the sky that emitted an ancient aura. The power even made the Azure Dragon True Bone in his chest tremble in fear. Lin Yun knew that this wasn’t something that Yu Haotian could execute!

“Brat, hand your fortune over obediently! Phaseless Demonic Art — Moonlight Gleam!” Yu Haotian laughed as he threw another punch. Then, the demonic moon broke through the clouds with a massive pressure descending onto the plaza. Shortly after, Yu Haotian clenched his fist and roared, “This is how you should use the Divine Shadow Glove!”

A remnant soul appeared from the demonic moon. It was the image of the Jairus Demonic Soul. The soul turned into a beam and shot towards Lin Yun. Lin Yun had no other choice but to dodge the attack quickly.

He followed the path of the black beam and found a black hole in the ground. But before he could even react, the demonic moon began to spin faster, unleashing more beams towards Lin Yun. At this moment, he was forced into a constant retreat.

“This body is too weak. Otherwise, I could just throw the demonic moon at Lin Yun to kill him. But… it should be enough with the Divine Shadow Glove” Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed with dense greed.

Under the demonic beams, Lin Yun tried his best not to get hit. But he was still struck by a beam and went flying. Simultaneously, little ripples spread out on his Azure Dragon Saint Armor.

“You’re still too young.” Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed coldly before he turned into a black azure dragon. Then, he whipped the tail at Lin Yun. The intense impact left cracks on Lin Yun’s armor as Yu Haotian reached out for Lin Yun’s chest.

When Yu Haotian’s hand broke through the armor, the demonic spirit’s eyes flashed with joy. It laughed while reaching for the bone, “It’s a huge waste for you to have the Azure Dragon True Bone. Let me take it off your hands. It will shine brightly with me!”

But Lin Yun merely looked at the demonic spirit indifferently and barked, “What are you trying to do?”

This demonic spirit instantly felt that something was amiss. But it was already too late for him to react as he had come in contact with the Azure Dragon True Bone. In that split second, the divine rune on the Azure Dragon True Bone shined brightly with violent thunderstorm energy surging out.

When the thunderstorm energy swept over, Yu Haotian’s face distorted from the pain. Fear flashed in the demonic spirit’s eyes because he was actually foolish enough to touch a complete divine rune on his own accord.
