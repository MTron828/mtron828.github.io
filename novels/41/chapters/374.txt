Chapter 375 - Last Three

Half an hour later, Shui Wuhen, who came late to the eighth level, bumped into someone he never expected. Bai Yue was seated on the ground with his hair scattered in a mess. When Shui Wuhen got closer to Bai Yue, he saw the terrifying gash on Bai Yue’s chest.

But that wasn’t the fatal wound. The fatal one was the stab wound in his chest. It was just half an inch away from Bai Yue’s heart.

“Who did this?” asked Shui Wuhen.

Bai Yue opened his eyes and looked at Shui Wuhen. He wasn’t surprised by Shui Wuhen’s appearance because he guessed that there would be someone else on this level. But he was too focused on Lin Yun earlier and exhausted too much energy. So he never imagined that he would encounter Shui Wuhen while he was in this pathetic state.

“Lin Yun,” responded Bai Yue.

“So it really was him.” Shui Wuhen already had a guess when he saw Bai Yue’s wounds. After all, no one else used a sword aside from Lin Yun. Although there was Mu Xiuhan, the latter didn’t enter the Black Lotus Palace. Shui Wuhen now realized that he made a smart decision by not fighting with Lin Yun for the Violet Palace Realm’s beast core.

As for Mu Xiuhan, he couldn’t blame anyone for his current state. He was already injured in the battle with the Indigo Thunderfiend Dracoape and his cosmic artifact was on the verge of shattering. So he could only blame himself for insisting on snatching the beast core even after Lin Yun pulled out his cosmic artifact.

“What was the treasure in this hall?” Compared to the culprit who wounded Bai Yue, Shui Wuhen was more interested in the treasure.

“A Yin-Yang Pellet,” said Bai Yue with a dark face.

“Are you sure?” Shui Wuhen’s brows twitched. He clearly became emotional when he heard about the treasure.

“Do you really think I would get it wrong? There were two dragons of two opposite elements. How can I be wrong?” snorted Bai Yue.

“What a pity.” Shui Wuhen looked disappointed. “The Yin-Yang Pellet that can allow the consumer to form the perfect violet palace, but it will probably go to waste in his hands.”

Only experts at the level of the eighth titles would need the Yin-Yang Pellet. The medicinal effect of the pellet was secondary. Lin Yun was only in the eighth stage, so it would be a waste if he refined it.

“Hmph, it’s good if he wastes it,” replied Bai Yue. His eyes flickered coldly because the pellet originally belonged to him.

Shui Wuhen didn’t continue the conversation and smiled, “Have fun here. Perhaps you might be able to make your breakthrough to the tenth stage in the one day that you’re here."

Shui Wuhen’s words stunned Bai Yue because that was what he was planning to do. The density of the spiritual energy here was unimaginable to the outside world. He was only half a step away from the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm, so he would have an opportunity to take revenge against Lin Yun outside the Black Lotus Palace if he managed to make a breakthrough.

“You’re not going to force me to leave?” Bai Yue was shocked that Shui Wuhen actually allowed him to stay.

“You’re just a defeated dog. Why should I be bothered about you? Wouldn’t it be a great loss to me if you went all out?” Shui Wuhen gently fanned himself. His words nearly drove Bai Yue to the edge. Shui Wuhen smiled, “I’m done wasting my time with you. You know the rules, right?”

“I do!” Bai Yue gritted his teeth. He knew that there were no good people in the Black Lotus Palace. It wasn’t like he was a good person to begin with. He gently tapped his interspatial pouch and retrieved a jade bottle.

“I got this on the seventh level. There are a total of ten Coldcloud Pellets, which are fourth grade spiritual pellets. It goes well with your Cloudmist Art.”

“A bottle of Coldcloud Pellets for your life. It’s a valuable trade. Good luck in making your breakthrough.” Shui Wuhen was satisfied with the pellets.

“It’s best if you die under Lin Yun’s sword,” said Bai Yue coldly.

“I won’t. Wait for my legend to spread in the Extermination Barrens. I will bring about the legend once more by ascending the tenth stage.” Shui Wuhen didn’t turn around. He was amused by Bai Yue. He spared Bai Yue’s life, but Bai Yue still hated him.

On the other hand, Bai Yue could only look at Shui Wuhen’s figure with jealousy. He didn’t believe that Shui Wuhen could make it to the tenth level and create another legend in the Extermination Barrens. But at least Shui Wuhen had that qualification. Bai Yue had lost it.

It’s all because of Lin Yun! Bai Yue’s eyes blazed with fury. Regardless of the Yin-Yang Pellet or the Coldcloud Pellets, it was all because of Lin Yun. There was no way Bai Yue could take this lying down.

Simultaneously, another battle had just come to an end. Jing Jue had defeated both Feng Ye and Tang Yuan by himself.

The robust Feng Ye was lying on the ground with his blood pooling on the ground like a lake. But he was fortunate that his bloodline wasn't like others. So he was still brimming with vitality despite his grave injuries.

On the other side, Tang Yuan kneeled on the ground as he clutched his chest. He was in a better state than Feng Ye. He had only taken a hit, but that hit broke three of his ribs. However, he couldn’t get up on his feet anymore and even something as simple as breathing was painful.

Jing Jue stood with his hair fluttering in the air as he looked around coldly. He was also injured, but he was in a better state than Feng Ye and Tang Yuan. He sheathed his saber and walked towards the Lotus Treasure Stage where an ancient cosmic artifact was waiting for him.

Feng Ye and Tang Yuan both had difficulty standing. In the end, they could only watch as Jing Jue took the cosmic artifact.

Jing Jue drew out the saber by half an inch and he looked at it with satisfaction. This weapon hadn’t been demonized, which meant that it couldn’t be used in the Black Lotus Palace. But at the same time, it also meant that the weapon wasn’t damaged. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

With a smile, Jing Jue sheathed the saber. He took out a napkin to wipe it carefully before storing it in a box.

“It’s rare that someone manages to survive after being defeated by me. But I’m in a good mood, so I decided not to kill the two of you.” Jing Jue turned around and placed his hands behind his back. “Hand over your treasures. You can either do it yourselves or I’ll help myself to it.”

“You bastard!” roared Feng Ye. He was robbed again, and this time, it was much worse than his encounter with Lin Yun.

Tang Yuan didn’t say a word and took out three treasures from his interspatial pouch. They were treasures he had gotten from the Lotus Treasure Stage. It was an ancient jar of wine, an incense cauldron, and an ancient painting.

Jing Jue nodded his head in satisfaction when he saw them. Tang Yuan then crushed the jade slip and disappeared from the Lotus Treasure Hall. He was more decisive than Feng Ye.

Feng Ye spoke out reluctantly, “Jing Jue, we’re both disciples of sects at the borders of the Great Qin Empire. There’s no need to take it so far, is there?”

“It’s fine if you’re unwilling. But we can see if you can crush the jade slip faster than my saber.” Jing Jue placed his hand on the saber hilt.

“Screw you! Take it!” Feng Ye cursed and also took out three treasures like Tang Yuan. It was a bottle of pellets, a fruit, and a flower that emitted an aromatic fragrance.

Crushing the jade slip, Feng Ye glared at Jing Jue, “Watch out!”

Jing Jue responded by snorting in disdain. He couldn’t be bothered with someone that he had defeated. Stepping forward, he stored the six treasures into his interspatial pouch without any hesitation.

Simultaneously, the appearance of Tang Yuan, Feng Ye, and Bai Yue had caused quite a commotion. This meant that three people had been eliminated.

When the Bloodbone Gate’s Mu Xiuhan was also transported out, it caused an even greater uproar. Everyone was shocked that Mu Xiuhan was eliminated and they were all trying to guess who had defeated Mu Xiuhan.

“Xiuhan, what’s wrong?”

“I didn’t enter the Black Lotus Palace,” he replied.

“What?!” The Bloodbone Gate’s elders were shocked.

Mu Xiuhan didn’t give an explanation. He glanced in the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s direction and faintly said, “Let’s just wait.”

There was nothing to say if Lin Yun died in the Black Lotus Palace, but if Lin Yun was alive, then he had to get revenge no matter what. He had forged a notorious reputation for himself with his sword, but he was actually defeated by a junior. He had never suffered such humiliation in his life.

After the four were transported, no one else was sent out of the Black Lotus Palace. This caused all the sects to discuss among themselves because this naturally meant that there were three people who made it to the ninth level.

“Wow, it has been a thousand years since someone ascended the ninth level. But there are three of them who made it.”

“The Sevendespair Palace’s Jing Jue, Demonic Moon Villa’s Shui Wuhen, and Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Lin Yun. I never expected that it would be those three.”

“Didn’t Wen Yanbo say that Zhang Yan is still not out yet?”

“Haha, did you really take his boasting seriously? No one has seen Zhang Yan in the Black Lotus Palace, while people have seen Lin Yun, Shui Wuhen, and Jing Jue.”

“I wonder who will be able to reach the end.”

The sects weren’t willing to leave without seeing the final winner. At the same time, the atmosphere in the Extermination Barrens also became even more intense.

Meanwhile, everyone from the Sword Firmament Pavilion was excited. It had been a long time since the Sword Firmament Pavilion received such attention and the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s fame would surely spread if they made it to the end.
