Chapter 1802 - Meeting Mei Zihua Again

After Gu Jun drank the last drop of wine, he shook the jar heavily before he explained, “Speaking of the Blood Moon Sect, it’s a powerful foe of the Divine Dragon Empire.”

“That, I know.” Lin Yun replied. “Say something I don’t.”

“Take it slow. Do you know about the Dark Era?” Gu Jun smiled.

After Lin Yun nodded his head, Gu Jun continued, “Tell me what you know, then.”

Glancing at Gu Jun, Lin Yun said, “After the battle of deities a hundred thousand years ago, all the gods fell, the Dragon Gate was destroyed, and the Golden Era was gone. Thus, darkness descended and heroes rose together to fight them. It was a time when the world was devastated, and mortals could only live pitifully like mere ants. But the Nine Emperors appeared, ending the Dark Era and founding the Divine Dragon Empire.”

This was something many people knew about. There were still other secrets, such as the death of the Southern Emperor, but they seemed doubtful. Some say the Nine Emperors wanted to reestablish the Dragon Gate, but they established the Divine Dragon Empire in the end. As a result, this created a crack between the Southern Emperor and the Empress. Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng parted ways with the Divine Dragon Empire, while the Demon Emperor remained indifferent.

No one knew exactly what happened during that period, but what did it have to do with the Blood Moon Sect?

“Did you know that three thousand years ago, aside from the birth of the Nine Emperors, there were also the Three Monarchs?” Gu Jun asked. He continued, “The Three Monarchs are close to deities in their strength, and they’re also believed to be able to end the Dark Era. They’re the Demon Monarch, Blood Monarch, and the Nether Monarch. The Blood Monarch is the ancestor of the Blood Moon Sect, and the three monarchs cannot be truly killed. Even the Southern Emperor only managed to heavily injure and seal the Blood Monarch, but could not kill him. So it’s just a matter of time for the Blood Moon Sect to make a comeback, not to mention the Divine Dragon Empire is in trouble recently because the source of the Dark Era is showing signs of returning.”

“The Demonspirit Clan?” Lin Yun asked.

Nodding his head, Gu Jun explained, “The Demonspirit Clan is extremely terrifying. They weren’t eradicated three thousand years ago, but have been secretly infiltrating into the various forces.”

Lin Yun furrowed his brows when he heard that because he had come in contact with the Demonspirit Clan in the past. He never expected the Demonspirit Clan to also be outside the ruins.

“Because the Divine Dragon Empire has to face a lot of enemies recently, the Blood Moon Sect has been showing signs of reviving. There have been rumors that the Blood Monarch is awakening.” Gu Jun said with a grave expression.

“It’s no wonder why the Saint Elder said that the appearance of the Blue Dragon Record might not be a piece of good news. The golden age will reappear, and that means darkness will reawaken.” Lin Yun muttered to himself.

“This is why I said that the Black Tortoise Void Sea will be chaotic, and it’s best for you not to join the chaos.” Gu Jun warned.

“What are they going to look for in the Black Tortoise Void Sea?” Lin Yun asked.

“The Black Tortoise Saint Canon!” Gu Jun placed the wine jar down, then raised his head, “The Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise are powerful divine beasts in ancient times. Their cultivation and secret techniques are passed down through bloodlines, and they’re all divine cultivation techniques that only pure-blooded divine beasts can practice.

“When divine beasts take on humanoid forms and marry humans, their descendants will possess that divine beast’s bloodline. Thus, they changed their inheritance to suit humans. They’re the Vermilion Bird Saint Canon, Azure Dragon Saint Canon, White Tiger Saint Canon, and the Black Tortoise Saint Canon.” Gu Jun briefly paused before he continued, “This is how your Azure Dragon’s inheritance has been passed down, but it’s not the genuine Azure Dragon Saint Canon. It can only be found in the Azure Dragon Ancestral Land.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that because he also heard the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master mentioning it, and his Azure Dragon’s inheritance was only a small portion.

“But after the Golden Era collapsed, all the pure-blooded divine beasts in the world disappeared. No one knows where they went, and the bloodline purity of their descendants isn't high. Their bloodline purity can no longer be compared to ancient times. Those with the divine beasts’ bloodlines became a target in the Dark Era. Their descendants were either slaughtered or went into hiding. Then again, there are also those who rose because there are many people in the Divine Dragon Empire possessing the Dragon Clan’s bloodline.” Gu Jun sorrowfully explained.

“Why do you look so sad? Don’t tell me that you also possess a divine beast’s bloodline?” Lin Yun smiled.

Gu Jun was briefly stunned before he glared at Lin Yun, “Don’t bullshit!”

Lin Yun smiled but no longer dwelled on that. He asked, “Does the Black Tortoise Void Sea really have the Black Tortoise Saint Canon?”

“They’re just rumors. Perhaps there are some scrolls or secret techniques, but no one knows where the complete Black Tortoise Saint Canon is located.” Gu Jun said seriously.

Lin Yun pondered about it and found it pretty reliable.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“But even if they’re just some scrolls, they’re extremely valuable. If you can find clues of the complete inheritance, it will be worth it.” Gu Jun said.

Lin Yun thought about his Divine Tortoise Transformation and fell into deep thoughts. An Liuyan’s mission should be to find similar scrolls. “I have to go to the Black Tortoise Void Sea no matter what.”

“What’s wrong? Why maintain such a high profile? Aren’t you first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. Do you know how many people’s eyes are on you? If you go there, no one can protect you.” Gu Jun said unhappily.

But Lin Yun took out the tortoiseshell and said, “Because of this tortoiseshell fragment. If I go, there’s a high chance that I can find something.”

“Mhm? It’s really a fragment of the black tortoise. Let me see which lineage this belongs to!” Gu Jun’s eyes lit up. But just when he wanted to grab it, Lin Yun already stowed the tortoiseshell.

“You really have a lot of secrets.” Gu Jun said furiously.

“You’re not simple, either.” Lin Yun smiled. He was just probing Gu Jun, but he was practically sure this old man possessed a divine beast’s bloodlines. Lin Yun was pretty interested in the Black Tortoise Saint Canon. He might not necessarily cultivate it, but he could use it as a reference. He would definitely walk his own path after becoming a Saint, creating his own sword technique and inheritance. If he couldn’t learn from other strengths, it was practically a pipe dream to create his own path.

After a brief consideration, Lin Yun said, “Don’t tell An Liuyan about this.”

Lin Yun then went to bid farewell to Yue Weiwei. After this farewell, he probably wouldn’t return to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, and they might have to part for a long time.

After Lin Yun left, Yue Weiwei looked at his silhouette and dazed off. She knew that this day would come sooner or later, and she was already mentally prepared. She was worried about Lin Yun’s safety after leaving the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

“Senior Sister, there’s a high possibility that Big Brother Lin is heading to the Black Tortoise Void Sea…” Yue Weiwei turned to look at Mu Xueling.

Mu Xueling naturally knew what she was thinking, and she replied, “There’s a restriction at the Black Tortoise Void Sea. Those with a higher cultivation have a higher chance of triggering the restriction, so it’s practically impossible for those at the Profound Death Stage to enter. He can protect himself well. Not to mention he also knew it wouldn’t be an easy path when he decided to be first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. So don’t worry about him.”

But Yue Weiwei bit her lips and said, “What if he leaves the Black Tortoise Void Sea?”

Seeing how pitiful Yue Weiwei looked, Mu Xueling ultimately sighed, “Speak. What do you want me to do?”

Yue Weiwei smiled, and embraced Mu Xueling, “Hehe. I know Senior Sister is the best!”

After leaving the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, Lin Yun immediately headed to the edge of Heavenly Domain City. If he wanted to go to the Black Tortoise Void Sea, he had to take a ship if he wanted to go to various dangerous places.

Heavenly Domain City had four piers, and each pier had multiple massive ships, and the port was crowded.

At this moment, one month had passed since the Martial Dao Tea Party and everyone already knew that Lin Xiao had obtained first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking and defeated two God Generals.

Lin Yun could hear a lot of news related to him, the Blood Moon Sect, and how Ji Lingfeng and others made a breakthrough in the Samsara Edict Realm as he walked around the port.

He was calm and composed. He entered a tavern, wanting to inquire about the latest news about the Black Tortoise Void Sea. The moment he stepped into the tavern, the surrounding discussions far surpassed his expectations.

Lin Yun wore a bamboo hat to conceal his identity, and sat down in a corner. He ordered a cup of wine and casually drank it. The bamboo hat was pretty effective, and no one would recognize him if they didn’t take a closer look at his appearance.

“Hey, handsome. Do you mind if I sit here?” Not long after Lin Yun sat down, a person sat down opposite him. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Mei Zihua, whom he hadn’t seen for quite a while.
