Chapter 145 - Surrounded by Enemies

With another swish, another person landed on a lotus platform as well. It was the Demonic Moon Villa’s Si Xueyi. When he sat down, the other cultivators from the Demonic Moon Villa immediately surrounded him. Everyone wore a bitter expression when they saw this scene. With the Demonic Moon Villa’s backing, who would dare to provoke them?

As those two took the lead, the silence was broken by their action. Lin Yun observed this situation and did not make a move. He knew that it wasn’t time for him to stand out yet. However, despite how everyone was tempted to make a move, no one dared to disrupt this stalemate.

“I’ll claim this third lotus seat!” Wang Ning soared into the sky and landed on a lotus platform.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Several ill-intentioned auras locked onto Wang Ning. Bai Lixuan and Si Xueyi’s fame was widely spread in the Great Qin Empire, but not many people knew about Wang Ning. They were, however, familiar with Wang Teng, who was an existence equivalent to Bai Lixuan.

“What’s the matter? Someone wants to make a move?” Wang Bo sneered, “stand up and let me see who’s blind enough to do it.”

Boom!

The aura of a Quasi-Profound Martial Realm swept out from him along with his voice. His aura was terrifying and seemed like a sturdy mountain.

Lin Yun was inwardly shocked by Wang Bo’s cultivation. He was stronger than the two elders from the Blood Cloud Sect and the Golden Flame Sect.

As he spoke, the other Wang Clan’s cultivators glared into the surrounding. Shortly after, the ill-intentioned gazes were retracted. The Wang Clan’s reputation and strength deterred everyone.

“A bunch of garbage.” Wang Ning sneered with contempt in his eyes. His horizons had expanded, so he could only feel disdain for Xiantian Realm cultivators from a remote place like the Azure Sun County.

“What a disgusting fellow…”

“Where did he come from? How dare he behave with such arrogance when his cultivation is only in the fifth orifice of the Xiantian Realm.”

“Hush! He’s a descendant from the Wang Clan’s main branch.”

Everyone was unconvinced by Wang Ning’s strength. After all, no one knew about him before today. The Wang Clan was only a noble clan, and it wasn’t comparable to the likes of the Sword Firmament Pavilion and Demonic Moon Villa, who transcended even the empire itself.

Shortly after, the other Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators took the remaining lotus platforms one after another. Anyone whose cultivation was above the Xiantian Realm was forbidden to enter the Azure Sun Realm.

It might be dangerous for Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators to enter the Azure Sun Realm, but they would be the strongest if they made it in.

When everyone saw the Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators taking up the lotus seats, no one dared to raise an objection. Many hidden sects beyond the Great Qin Empire showed up as well. The Azure Sun Realm was located between the borders of many neighboring empires.

Every time the Azure Sun Realm opened, it would welcome many hidden forces who did not want to miss out on the opportunity. However, they usually kept a low-profile and did not dare to take it too far. After all, this wasn’t their territory.

In the blink of an eye, twelve of the lotus seats had been occupied and only six were left. In the next second, three old men who emitted powerful auras went up to the lotus seats.

“Those old fogies are shameless!”

“All of them are over a hundred years old and they’re still fighting with youngsters for this opportunity. They’re shameless!”

Curses suddenly rang out from the surrounding. The cultivation of the three old men was in the Quasi-Profound Martial Realm. They did not belong to any forces, but it was undeniable that each of them was powerful. No matter how everyone cursed at the three of them, the three would turn a blind eye.

Lin Yun smiled at this scene. It seems that the longer one lives, the thicker their face becomes. Most of the eighteen lotus seats were occupied by either Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators or were supported by Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators.

Without the strength to contend with the Quasi-Profound Martial Realm, it was impossible to occupy a seat among the eighteen lotus seats. With that, only three of the eighteen lotus seats were left!

When the curses gradually died down, the surrounding atmosphere became weird. Everyone knew that there was no hope in fighting for the fifteen lotus seats, so they could only fight for the remaining three.

However, there were seven or eight thousand people left in the plaza whose strength ranged from the fifth to seven orifice of the Xiantian realm. If there were nothing unexpected, a tragic battle would soon unfold before them.

In the end, Lin Yun decided to start the competition.

Whoosh!

Lin Yun soared into the sky and occupied a lotus seat under everyone’s gaze.

“It’s Lin Yun!”

“A brat in the fourth orifice dares to stand out?”

“He’s simply courting death. Even the seventh orifice cultivators do not dare to stand out.”

“But I heard he has a Cosmic Treasure with him…”

“Cosmic Treasure? Who knows if it’s the truth. Even if he does possess one, how can he bring out the power with his cultivation?”

An uproar broke out in the surrounding. No one had expected that Lin Yun would start the battle.

“I’ll be taking this lotus stage and anyone can come at me if they disagree.” Lin Yun declared and swept his glance around. His long hair fluttered in the wind, and his face looked immature compared to those in the surrounding.

His eyes flickered, unafraid of the surrounding gazes directed at him.

He finally came out! Mei Zihua and Xue Tu’s eyes lit up.

Lin Yun was simply courting death to take a lotus seat. In this place, even their sects and the hidden sects did not dare to speak in such a harsh tone. Many sixth and seventh orifice cultivators ended up looking at Lin Yun.

Some did not choose to reveal themselves. They might not have strong cultivation, but they were greatly experienced when it came to fighting as they had many hidden measures to use.

So how dare someone in the fourth orifice of the Xiantian Realm issue a challenge. The only change he had would be using the Cosmic Treasure.

But there were many people in the surrounding and the slightest carelessness would destroy them completely.

“This brat will surely use his Cosmic Treasure later. At that time, I’ll have to trouble the Elder to take him out!” Xue Tu sneered. Since Lin Yun had given them a chance, he had to grasp it well.

“Don’t worry. I’ll teach him something worse than death if he’s careless.” A Blood Cloud Sect’s elder declared, his eyes brimming with hatred for Lin Yun. He still couldn’t forget the humiliation he suffered from being extorted.

Many people were glaring daggers at Lin Yun. Standing on the seat, Lin Yun was like a bomb that would go off anytime. But this was his choice. How can you stand out if you don’t fight while everyone else does?

He did not have anyone to rely on except for his sword. Rather than being dragged into the fight, he would rather face it head-on. After all, the fight would be brutal if he waited till the end.

A commotion broke out as everyone hostilely glared daggers at Lin Yun. But for a second, no one dared to make a move against him. After all, there were rumors of him extorting the Blood Cloud Sect and Golden Flame Sect.

There was also the fact that Lin Yun possessed a Cosmic Treasure which drew the jealousy of everyone. If Lin Yun really had a Cosmic Treasure, then he would be able to kill them easily.

It was especially so for those old men who were in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm. They were looking at this scene with their eyes flickering. They did not want to stand out.

“This sword slave is somewhat capable…” Wang Ning clicked his tongue and was unhappy at this scene. It had been half a year, and Lin Yun had already grown to this height, causing such deterrence to thousands of people.

“Filthy brat, do you recognize me?” A roar soon rang out, breaking the stalemate.

Boom!

It was an old man with a blazing heatwave coming from him.

“It’s Senior Wang!”

“What terrifying fire elemental spiritual aura! Senior Wang has been rumored to cultivate in the Heavenly Flame Peak throughout the year and his strength had grown so terrifying.”

“Does that brat have a grudge with Senior Wang?”

“Tsk, tsk. It’s on him to make enemies everywhere. It’s good that Senior Wang is making a move to test Lin Yun’s strength.”

Lin Yun raised his brow. He recognized this old man. Back in the Heavenly Flame Peak, he had snatched the Eighth Grade Lava Core from this old man. He smiled, “I naturally remember you. Speaking of which, I have to thank you for that Eighth Grade Lava Core. After all, I could only reach the Thunderblitz Battle Physique because of it.”

“Eighth Grade Lava Core?”

“Senior Wang has dominated the Heavenly Flame Peak for years, and he suffered a loss at the hands of this kid…”

Lin Yun’s voice immediately stirred a disturbance in the surrounding. All of them felt that Lin Yun was bold. Even with Senior Wang’s strength, Lin Yun had caused him to suffer a loss. Furthermore, Lin Yun did not have the Cosmic Treasure back then…

“Little bastard, I’ll kill you today!” Senior Wang’s face turned red from listening to Lin Yun ridiculing him in public. He immediately soared into the sky and made his move.

Wild Dragon Fist!

The old man was like a dragon that emitted a faint dragon aura. It truly matched his cultivation in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm. His punch flew down, aimed at Lin Yun’s head.

The momentum from his punch came crashing down like a mountain. When everyone witnessed the mighty aura coming from the punch, there was a trace of envy in their eyes.

Lin Yun faced it calmly with his fighting will boiling. He frantically circulated the Iris Sword Sutra in his body.

This old man had once forced me to cower in the lava crater, not daring to show up. But the old man wanted to repeat it again? Impossible!

Lin Yun’s body started to turn purple. He had activated the Thunderblitz Battle Physique in that instant. With a shake of his body, the sword box fell onto the ground.

Boom!

He was releasing a violent aura from his body that belonged to the Thunderblitz Battle Physique, shattering the terrifying aura that came from the old man. In the next second, Lin Yun stepped forward with a cold flicker in his eyes.

The wind as dragon, cloud as tiger. As wind and cloud combine, the Dragon-Tiger Might!

Lin Yun took a step forward and the aura that emitted from him surged by tenfold, soaring into the sky.

“Old man, I’m grateful for your kindness in the past. Now, let me repay you with my punch!”

Contrary to everyone’s expectation, Lin Yun did not defend. Instead, he attacked.
