Chapter 453 - The Unknown Sixth Level

“Hmph, he’s just jealous that you received a title and that he lost to a barbarian,” said Li Wuyou. The group finished chatting and got ready to go, but a group approached them right when they were about to leave. The one leading the group was naturally the crown prince, Qin Yu. There was no expression on Qin Yu’s face, but when he looked at Lin Yun, he could barely contain his killing aura. Clearly, his intention to kill Lin Yun hadn’t lessened.

“What are you doing here?” questioned Xin Yan.

“I’m naturally here to see my fiancé and to congratulate our new title,” smiled Qin Yu.

“Please watch your words. No one here is your fiancé. Big Sister Xin Yan has no relationship with you,” said Lin Yun as he stepped forward to shield Xin Yan from Qin Yu.

“Is that so? Too bad, but no one can stop me from getting what I want. Guess what request I will make to the envoy when I become the champion?” Qin Yu said with a playful smile as he looked at Xin Yan greedily. He was implying that he would request to have Xin Yan back.

“Oh really? Why don’t you guess what my request will be?” retorted Lin Yun with killing aura brimming in his eyes.

Qin Yu merely replied with a disdainful smile before he turned and walked away. “You should be more worried about yourself right now. I know Trueorigin’s strength better than you do. It will be good enough if you can survive your fight with him. As for the championship? Don’t even dream about it. There’s no way a sword slave like you can become a champion in the Great Qin Empire’s Dragon Gate Competition.”

Clearly, Qin Yu didn’t think that Lin Yun would survive the fight with Trueorigin. His arrogance made the countenance of the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party fall. The threat that he uttered was like a dark cloud that loomed over their heads.

“Junior Brother, I’m sure he has other objectives in becoming the champion. He probably won’t pay any attention to me. He’s just here to disrupt your thoughts so that you won’t be able to fight Trueorigin three days from now,” said Xin Yan.

When Lin Yun thought about Xin Yan’s words, he knew there was a possibility that they were true. After all, he nearly lost control of himself earlier.

“But he’s right. Trueorigin isn’t an easy opponent. He was top three in the previous Dragon Gate Competition and he’s on the same level as Drifting Goblet in the Heavenly Profound Sect. Junior Brother, why don’t you give up?” requested Xin Yan.

Lin Yun reaching the quarterfinals had exceeded everyone’s expectations. His name would surely spred throughout the empire. So there was no need for him to risk his life fighting Trueorigin. Now that he thought about it, Qin Yu might be trying to provoke him on purpose to prevent him from giving up the competition.

Give up? Lin Yun looked at the dusky sky. Since he had inherited Xin Jue’s will, he definitely had to compete and become the champion.

“Lin Yun, what did Qin Yu say?” Luo Feng came over with his eyebrows frowned.

“Nothing much. Elder Luo, I’ll be in the Sword Burial Woods for the next three days,” said Lin Yun.

“What about your injuries?” Luo Feng was shocked. Everyone had clearly seen how terribly injured Lin Yun was in his fight with Heartcliff. Although he slew Heartcliff, it didn’t mean that he was without injury. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“It doesn’t matter. I blocked the majority of his last attack. It might seem terrifying, but it didn’t injure me much,” explained Lin Yun.

“That’s great. But remember to come on time three days from now. Otherwise, you’ll lose the competition,” reminded Luo Feng.

“I know,” said Lin Yun.

Night came and the bustling streets had settled down. However, Idlecloud Pavilion was still filled with people wanting to bet on the next series of fights. The fight between Bai Lixuan VS Yue Qing, Qin Yu VS Feng Ye, Aquaselenic VS Situ Yi, and Trueorigin VS Lin Yun.

Without a doubt, Qin Yu was the popular candidate. His rate was close to 1:1, which practically made everyone lose their interest in betting. As for Feng Ye, he had successfully surpassed Lin Yun and became the participant with the highest rates.

Additionally, everyone was paying attention to the fight between Bai Lixuan and Yue Qing. The rates were just slightly higher than Qin Yu’s, so there wasn’t much interest in betting on this fight either..

The rates for the fight between Aquaselenic and Situ Yi were decent. This simply meant that the Myriad Treasure Pavilion wasn’t sure who would win. After all, guessing the winner not only required eyesight, but also luck.

However, the rate for Lin Yun and Trueorigin’s fight confused everyone. If this were the past, Lin Yun would have an incredibly high rate, so anyone who dared to bet on him would receive huge winnings.

But Lin Yun had shocked everyone when he killed two titled figures, especially because of his fight with Heartcliff. Although the Myriad Treasure Pavilion’s upper hierarchy felt that Trueorigin was stronger and had more foundations than Lin Yun, they didn’t dare to increase the rates. After all, Lin Yun had created too many miracles and he was undoubtedly the darkhorse in this competition.

On the other hand, his rates for making it into the top three and championship were high. The rate of him becoming a champion was 1:100, and there was only one person who bet on it. It was Drifting Goblet’s bet.

“It’s impossible for Lin Yun to become the champion.”

“But this fight is too shocking. If he didn’t run into Trueorigin, I bet he could make it into the top four!”

“Yeah, but I don’t think Lin Yun has any odds of beating Qin Yu, Trueorigin, or Aquaselenic.”

“I don’t dare to bet on him becoming the champion, but I dare to bet on him beating Trueorigin. Hehe, who knows if Lin Yun can’t slay another titled figure after Twilight and Heartcliff?”

There was practically no one who bet on Lin Yun becoming a champion, but the conversation practically revolved around Lin Yun. After all, today’s fight was too exciting.

Jian Xuanhe had already left when Lin Yun came to the Sword Burial Woods. Only Lord Thirteen was present. When Lin Yun came, he revealed his intentions straightaway, “Lord Thirteen, I wish to head to the sixth level.”

“Are you out of your mind? Forget about the fact that you probably can’t reach that level. You won’t be able to last long there. Without the Violet Palace Realm cultivation, you’re just courting death by going there,” said Lord Thirteen.

“I don’t have any confidence of beating Qin Yu without the complete xiantian sword intent.” Lin Yun’s expression was firm. After all, Qin Yu had only shown the tip of the iceberg in the competition so far. Even when he faced Egret, he only used a palm.

Lord Thirteen looked at the youth before him for a long time before he smiled, “Oh yeah, it’s better to die in the Sword Burial Diagram if you can’t become the champion. Well, since you want to make the bet, then I’ll fulfil your wish.”

Along with an ancient hand seal, a great wind blew through the Sword Burial Woods and the sky turned dark. Shortly after, the distorted space appeared before Lin Yun. It was the passage that led to the mysterious world and it occasionally flickered with lightning. Lin Yun was familiar with that place because he had suffered a lot there.

Compared to the shock he felt back then, Lin Yun was more composed this time.

“Don’t die in there,” said Lord Thirteen just when Lin Yun was about to step in.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he entered the distorted space. Shortly after, a familiar scene appeared within Lin Yun’s view. The Sword Burial Diagram had a total of nine levels and each level represented a world. The further he went, the more dangerous it would be.

Looking at the eerie thunderclouds, Lin Yun fell into deep thought. The Iris Sword Sutra reached the fifth stage when he was here previously. When he thought about his current situation, he knew he needed to head to the sixth level to grasp the complete xiantian sword intent.

Lin Yun hesitated briefly before he charged into the sky. He was already familiar with the way, so he quickly reached the fifth level. Although Lin Yun had undergone a transformation, the fifth level still made him feel fearful. The fifth level’s sky was completely different from the previous four levels.

The lightning formed by sword intent in the thunderclouds dyed the entire sky red. The bolts of lightning would cause explosions on the ground when they fell and the broken swords on the platforms represented one’s life.

When Lin Yun walked in this place, he could sense the Flower Burial Sword buzzing within the box. Seeming to know what Lin Yun intended to do, the sword was buzzing with excitement.

Looking at the crimson thunderclouds, Lin Yun wasn’t sure if he should charge into the thunderclouds. However, he had to give it a try since he was here. Raising his brow, he looked at the crimson bolts of lightning and charged into the sky.
