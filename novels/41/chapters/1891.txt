Chapter 1892 - Fancied For Years (1)

The voice’s owner was Miao Yin, the disciple of the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s Serene Dust Great Saint.

Everyone was shocked when they saw Miao Yin coming over to Ye Qingtian’s side, and even Bai Shuying was surprised. Who in the Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t know that Ye Qingtian was a lecher? He was so notorious that even several Saint Elders have heard of him, and he was known as the shame of the sect.

Even if he had an outstanding appearance, which woman dared to stand beside him in public? But Miao Yin stood out for him and even stood by his side, which shocked everyone.

Lin Yun was also surprised and even wondered if his identity had been exposed. But that made no sense because Ye Xinyan would’ve transmitted her voice to him if his identity had been exposed. This meant that Ye Xinyan had a speculation, but she didn’t dare to confirm it. But as long as there was a wisp of possibility, she wouldn’t allow Zhang Yue to suppress Lin Yun. It was like how she protected him back at the Firmament Sword Pavilion, bearing it all.

As memories began to surface within Lin Yun’s mind, Lin Yun felt heartache, for some reason, and a strong urge to reconcile with Ye Xinyan. But the more he felt, the more he suppressed himself, even if Ye Xinyan stood beside him. He didn’t even dare to take a peek at Ye Xinyan.

Zhang Yue was also stunned and even suspected that he was dreaming. He couldn’t figure out why the Profound Maiden would stand with Ye Qingtian. After a long silence, he asked, “Profound Maiden Miao Yin, what did you just say?”

“You’re a saint’s disciple at the Nirvana Stage, and yet you want to move against a newly conferred saint disciple in public. How shameless can you be?” Ye Xinyan raised her head.

The surroundings fell into silence. It wasn’t because no one had considered that problem, but they overlooked it. After all, Ye Qingtian was a lowlife lecher in their eyes, and no one would care if someone taught him a lesson.

Zhang Yue’s face sank. He naturally knows shame and wouldn’t make a move if it was someone else. But it was a different case for Ye Qingtian because no one had said a word when he taught Ye Qingtian a lesson in the past.

Hearing the surrounding discussions, Zhang Yue’s face became uneasy, and he roared, “Profound Maiden Miao Yin, you have always been prideful. Why are you standing out against me today? Don’t tell me that you fancy that brat.”

“Zhang Yue shut your nonsense!” Miao Yin said furiously.

“How is that nonsense? Otherwise, why are you standing out for him? Don’t tell me you guys already had an affair in the dark?” Zhang Yue sneered.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes with chill flashing across his pupils because Zhang Yue was courting death.

But Zhang Yue wasn’t bothered by that, and wore a playful smile, “The Profound Maiden Miao Yin is beautiful, and you have plenty of people chasing after you. But I never expected that you’d fall for someone like him. Don’t tell me that this lecher did something to you?”

His smile was filled with sinister mockery, and many people echoed along with him. The Heavenly Dao Sect had three beauties. Bai Shuying was a heroic beauty. Miao Yin was famed for her outstanding appearance, voluptuous figure, and ethereal and fairy-like temperament.

She naturally became the dream lover of many people, not to mention that the Profound Maiden Courtyard allowed their disciples to get married. So Zhang Yue’s words naturally sent many people into a frenzy.

Far away, Bai Shuying furrowed her brows with disgust being revealed within her pupils. What Zhang Yue did was absolutely disgusting to her.

“Zhang Yue, what nonsense are you talking about?!”

“Don’t humiliate our senior sister without any evidence. How can there be someone as disgusting as you?”

“Hmph, you look more like a lecher in my eyes. Where did you get the guts to comment about Senior Brother Ye?”

The disciples of the Profound Maiden Courtyard stood out upon seeing Miao Yin being bullied. This instantly placed Zhang Yue in a difficult position and forced him to retreat.

“Dao Yang Palace’s Zhang Yue, remember what you said today!” A cold voice resounded, and everyone could sense the surrounding temperature falling.

The one who spoke was Lin Yun, and he coldly looked at Zhang Yue before leaving. Before he left the daofield, he threw a punch at the stone pillar that was beside him, causing the stone pillar to cave in and the entire ground to tremble. The sound produced was reverberating within the eardrums.

Ye Xinyan turned around and fell into deep thought when she saw this scene.

After all the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples left, Chen Jun’s face was pale, and he said, “Senior Brother, the Ye Qingtian today is terrifying.”

“So what can he do about it? He’s just a piece of garbage. What can he do to me? If Miao Yin didn’t stand out today, I would’ve made him beg on his knees,” Zhang Yue said with disdain.

“Well, that’s for sure. Senior Brother is at the Nirvana Stage, and you can easily crush him to death like an ant,” Chen Jun said.

But Zhang Yue was still furious and coldly snorted, “Consider him lucky this time. Let’s hope he doesn’t run into me in the future!”

Lin Yun had just walked out and briefly paused before quickening his footsteps.

When Lin Yun returned to the Indigo Thunder Peak, Lil’ Purple was terrified when she saw Lin Yun’s facial expression. It had been a long time since she saw Lin Yun’s face so ugly, and she quickly asked, “What’s the matter?”

Lin Yun simply explained what happened at the daofield to Lil’ Purple.

“What do you plan to do?” Lil’ Purple knew Lin Yun’s temper, and Zhang Yue would normally be taught a lesson if Lin Yun made a move on the spot. But since Lin Yun endured it, Zhang Yue’s outcome would be terrible once he made his move.

When Lin Yun whispered his plan to Lil’ Purple’s ears, her eyes gradually lit up before she laughed, “Hehe. Lin Yun, you’re so bad.”

But despite saying that, Lil’ Purple had excitement on her face, and she rubbed her hands together, “When are we going to start?”

“Tonight.” Lin Yun raised his head.

“Hehe, I like how decisive you are. I’ll go and scout the place with Lil’ Red,” Lil’ Purple said in a hurry.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“There’s no need to hurry. Let me get some paper,” Lin Yun said. When he prepared all the paper, he said, “You write it.”

“Write what?”

“I’ll recite, and you write. ‘I am incredibly impressed by the heroism you displayed on the daofield today, and I’m grateful for what you said on my behalf. To be honest, Shuying has long taken a fancy to you. I have suppressed my feelings for years, and I’m vexed about that. I hope that we can spend the night together in a place where no one is around…’”

Lil’ Purple could feel her scalp tingling after hearing what Lin Yun said, and she commented, “It sounds really disgusting.”

“Carry on writing. Tonight, when the moon is high, we’ll meet at…” Lin Yun continued after glaring at Lil’ Purple.

Lil’ Purple wrote seriously; her handwriting was feminine because she was a woman. In the end, she signed it with Bai Shuying’s name.
