Chapter 1831 - Black Thunder Saint Palace

The Black Thunder Chains was a genuine Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, engraved with the gloryfire and glorymetal spirits, weighing as much as ten thousand cauldrons. There was no doubt that this was a supreme treasure.

Mei Zihua naturally wouldn’t dare to touch it anymore because he nearly lost half of his life because of that, but Lin Yun naturally wasn’t afraid, with his physique. Even if he activated the Black Thunder Sacred flame that was within it, he could recover with the Blue Dragon Bone.

Looking at Lin Yun, Gu Jun said, “I’ll tell you honestly. If you don’t have the bloodline of the Thunder Black Tortoise’s lineage, using it won’t land you in any better state than Mei Zihua.”

But Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t fall for that so easily and replied, “I have the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, and I can bear the consequences of using it. If I can find the Black Thunder Saint Canon, I should be able to form the Black Thunder Saint Seal, and I might be able to refine it.”

Gu Jun snorted when he heard that, but kept quiet.

Right then, Mei Zihua opened his eyes and swung his right arm around. He even took out a zither to test if his arm was working normally. After he tried and played a beautiful melody, he rejoiced, “Brother Lin, I’m alright now. It’s all thanks to you this time!”

“I have something to discuss with you as well. What do you think of entrusting these Black Thunder Chains to me?” Lin Yun asked.

“I don’t want them! You can have them. I don’t want to touch them anymore, even if they’re a powerful Glory Saint Artifact.” Mei Zihua already had a phobia of the Black Thunder Chains, and quickly shook his hand.

“You’re really weak. Isn’t it just nearly cutting off your manhood?” Gu Jun said in disdain.

Mei Zihua’s face turned black when he heard that, and he said, “Old man, you can just shut up. I was nearly doomed because of you. It’s all thanks to Brother Lin.”

“You heartless ingrate. If it’s not for me, you wouldn’t even be able to maintain your manhood. How heartless…” Gu Jun said with a sneer, and the sorrow he revealed made Mei Zihua confused for a moment.

“Don’t listen to his crap. I’ll be keeping them for now. With this Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, we will have a higher chance within the Black Thunder Saint Palace.” Lin Yun said, looking at the Black Thunder Chains.

An hour later, a crimson figure appeared before the three of them.

“Young Master!” It was An Liuyan who chased after Lin Yun. When she saw Lin Yun, she had joy flushing from her pupils.

Lin Yun gave her a smile, and let out a breath of relief when he saw that she was fine. After all, An Liuyan was left behind when he had to lure the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit away, and he was pretty worried about her safety.

“Young Master, where’s the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit?” An Liuyan looked around, but she couldn’t see the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit anywhere. When she looked from afar earlier, it looked as though this region had nearly collapsed, especially when Gu Jun fought the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit with thunderbolts raging and the aura of the Black Tortoise filling this region. Even the mountain trembled, and this made everyone who saw it within ten thousand miles have their hearts tremble.

“It’s all thanks to Zihua. If not for him, I'm still unsure if we’d even be alive.” Lin Yun nodded his head with a smile.

An Liuyan looked at Mei Zihua, and said, “Young Master Mei is really powerful. It looks like I’ll have to depend on you more in the future.”

Looking at her, even Mei Zihua couldn’t help having ripples in his heart. But after recalling what happened earlier, he smiled, “It’s still alright. I’m just fortunate.”

“That’s because he’s lucky. You don’t know, he nearly lost his… hehehe.” Gu Jun smiled.

Mei Zihua’s face sank when he heard that, and this made An Liuyan even more interested. But when she pondered it again, she instantly knew it must be something awkward, so she smiled, “Where are we going now?”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

This made Mei Zihua let out a breath of relief, and he smiled, “We should be going to the Black Thunder Saint Palace.”

Lin Yun nodded his head in agreement. The Black Thunder Saint Canon was within the Black Thunder Saint Palace, not to mention the Demigod Wine Cellar was also there. So he had to go there no matter what. But he could also predict that there would be a lot of people gathered there as well.

“Oh, right. Young Master, I saw Kou Tianhua and the others. They probably wanted to come after you, but they hesitated for a long time before ultimately choosing to leave.” An Liuyan said, recalling it.

“Oh?” Lin Yun smiled. It was really a pity that they didn’t come. He knew that Kou Tianhua must still be eyeing the Demonfeather Order, but he also knew how terrifying the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was. After all, it was practically invincible within the Heavenly Thunder Palace. If he wasn’t careful, he might lose his life here. So it was within his expectations that Kou Tianhua wouldn’t dare to follow them.

“There’s no need to hurry. We’ll deal with him again after reaching the Black Thunder Saint Palace. Let’s go!” Lin Yun stood up. They had already delayed a lot of time, so they had to catch up with others quickly. Otherwise, nothing would be left for them by the time they reach it.

There might probably be many others who are similar to Gu Jun… Lin Yun inwardly pondered, knowing it would be dangerous. Not to mention that there would also be many experts on the Demonic Ranking over there, so he might be in a dangerous situation.

While thinking about it, several people rose to the sky and headed towards the Black Thunder Saint Palace. The remaining journey was smooth, and they could see treasures appearing along the way, which naturally sparked a battle amongst many experts.

But Lin Yun didn’t even take a glance at them and used the fastest speed to head towards the Black Thunder Saint Palace. The sky gradually became dark after two days and two nights. They could occasionally see lightning flickering in the sky.

There was also a massive tortoiseshell as huge as a palace engraved with various runes. That was the remnant phenomena of ancient deities, and the phenomena would still occasionally appear even after a hundred thousand years. Occasionally, it would even emit a terrifying aura.

“The thunder black tortoise energy…” Four people stood together on a tower, and Gu Jun lamented while looking at the phenomena.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he could feel a suppressive aura, even with his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. He knew that wasn’t just pure thunderclouds. It was also mixed with horrifying demonspirit aura and a demonic aura that made the thunder black tortoise aura even more terrifying.

“Overwhelming demonic clouds.” Lin Yun muttered to himself. He had an ill premonition.

“There are more fifth stage Profound Life Stage experts gathering together, and there are even some at the seventh stage Profound Life Stage.” Mei Zihua said cautiously. He had powerful mental energy. If Lin Yun didn’t use his sword intent, Mei Zihua’s perception would be the strongest and there would be many people hiding in the darkness.

From someone who would be scared by everything he saw to being cautious, Mei Zihua had grown a lot on this trip to the Black Tortoise Void Sea. But Mei Zihua hadn’t even detected his own changes, but Lin Yun noticed them. These people born with a golden spoon were terrifying because they would grow swiftly after sufficient life-and-death experiences.

“The Black Thunder Saint Palace shouldn’t be far away. Everyone, let’s split up, but be careful. Run if there are any dangers…” Lin Yun said, then he continued, “Liuyan can follow me.”

He had a lot of secrets that couldn’t be revealed to Mei Zihua and Gu Jun, but he could trust An Liuyan.

“Ha.” Gu Jun sneered. “In my view, you’re the true heir of the Black Tortoise Clan. Compared to you, I look like a counterfeit.”

There was a deeper meaning in Gu Jun’s tone because the Black Tortoise was the most lustful divine beast amongst the four.

An Liuyan raised her head and smiled, “Elder Gu, you must be joking. Young Master is only worried for my safety, and you have the purest Black Tortoise’s bloodline around.”

When An Liuyan spoke, Gu Jun immediately wore a smile. He replied, “That’s for sure. But Boss An, you can follow me if you can believe me. No one knows this Black Thunder Saint Palace better than me, and it’s safest to follow me!”

Mei Zihua briefly hesitated, before he coughed twice and said, “It’s also fine to follow me. I have a lot of hidden trump cards, and I can even use my life to protect Boss An!”

But An Liuyan merely stood beside Lin Yun with a smile and said nothing.

“Brat, are you looking for trouble?” Gu Jun glared at Mei Zihua, displeased by what he said.

Mei Zihua might be a little afraid of Gu Jun, but he didn’t back down this time. He replied, “I’m just worried about Boss An’s safety, and you’re already old. You can’t always take care of everything.”

“Who are you calling old?”

“I… Who said it?”

“Ha. Your guts are really small, but you’re pretty lustful. I should’ve amputated your manhood earlier!”

“Don't push it!” It didn’t take long for the two to start quarreling, and Mei Zihua’s face became red from the argument. But Lin Yun merely flew out with An Liuyan following behind him.

An hour later, Lin Yun and An Liuyan stopped, and they could see a massive barren land covered with ravines. The ravines reached tens of thousands of feet long with terrifying lightning magma at the bottom of it. Above the barren land were torrential flames and a demonic aura. This made them feel insignificant in comparison. When they raised their heads, they could see many corpses piling up along with many rusted weapons lying on the ground.

With a glance, anyone could tell that this place was a battlefield, and a terrifying battle probably took place here. After all, the owner of the Heavenly Thunder Palace waged a terrifying war with the demonspirits.

“Young master, where’s the Black Thunder Saint Palace?” An Liuyan looked around. She could only see a tattered battlefield but couldn’t see any buildings. There wasn’t even a slightly higher mountain here. After all, everything was destroyed in that battle a hundred thousand years ago.

“I have no idea. It looks like we have to cross this region to find the genuine Black Thunder Saint Palace.” Lin Yun said. Aside from those two, there were many experts gathered around here. But everyone was gauging how dangerous this place was. After all, this was where the main battle took place, and the phenomena here was frightening.
