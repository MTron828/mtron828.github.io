Chapter 1535 - Fisherman

Since Bai Liuying surrendered, Lin Yun naturally did not need to torture her. When the azure dragon coiling around Bai Liuying loosened up, she fell onto the ground. Her face was red, and she rested for a while before she recollected herself.

“Your injuries aren’t that heavy. So why are you so weak?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

Rolling her eyes, Bai Liuying replied, “Do you think it’s easy to execute a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique and the Dragon Locking Shackles?!”

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, and he knew why his master forbade him from touching ghost spirit martial techniques before reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“Don’t be smug!” Bai Liuying looked at Lin Yun. “My strength is restricted in this hall. If we’re in the outside world, it’s still uncertain who will win or lose!”

Lin Yun smiled and didn’t say a word because she was so competitive. When Bai Liuying saw Lin Yun wasn’t saying a word, she thought she was being looked down upon, and her face turned red, “What’s the matter? You don’t believe me?”

“I believe you.” Lin Yun nodded. “You’re proficient in spiritual runes, and you can borrow the power of heaven and earth to set up a spiritual array or a saint diagram. This hall is small, and this place greatly restricts your strength.”

Lin Yun could be considered half a saint spiritualist himself. So he naturally knew that what Bai Liuying said wasn’t a lie.

“Hmph, at least you have some eyesight. Let me help you remove the Dragon Locking Shackles, then.” Bai Liuying nodded her head and formed seals with her hands. Once the shackles in Lin Yun’s astral energy ocean were lifted, saint runes flew out, and Lin Yun suddenly felt that he had loosened up.

This was pretty interesting and his eyes flickered. Because the moment she succeeded in setting up the Dragon Locking Shackles, she would practically be invincible. Even a Dragon Pulse Realm expert would be at her mercy, which also taught him that he couldn’t underestimate anyone in this world.

But judging from her words, she might not undo the Dragon Locking Shackles for him if he didn’t praise her. She was a little petty, and she was pretty troublesome to deal with.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Hey, what’s your name again?”

“Sword Sect’s Lin Yun.”

“Lin Yun, you said that you had three methods. You only revealed two so far. So what’s the last one?” Bai Liuying asked curiously.

His last trump card was naturally the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron. If he used it, the disadvantage in his cultivation would be erased, and Lin Yun could even fight a Dragon Pulse Realm expert with the power of the cauldron. Then again, this only granted him the qualification to fight with Dragon Pulse Realm experts, and it would be better for him not to fight them.

“That’s a secret.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Ha, you’re a coward!” Bai Liuying said unhappily. After all, she even told Lin Yun about the Maneuver Word Art. But she wasn’t too bothered and changed the topic, “Sword Sect’s Lin Yun? I’ll teach you a lesson when we meet the next time.”

“Don’t you know that you’re already in the Dragon Pulse Realm? You’re already on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Dragon Pulse Ranking?” Bai Liuying was briefly stunned, but she wasn’t surprised about that. She then furrowed her brows, “It’ll look like I’m bullying you this way.”

“We can fight again after I reach the Dragon Pulse Realm.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Okay. That’s a promise, then! You can come and look for me in the Heavenly Dao Sect!” Bai Liuying agreed straightforwardly. She appreciated Lin Yun’s talent, and Lin Yun’s talent in the sword had left a deep impression on her.

“Your main body doesn’t know me, and I might be beaten to death by her if I go and look for her all of a sudden.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hahaha!” Bai Liuying laughed. “Don’t worry about that. My main body will notice when my name disappears from the Elysium Core Ranking. At that time, she will purchase our fight scene and conversation! You won this fight!”

As Bai Liuying’s body dissipated, she returned to the dragon spirit. Lin Yun still couldn’t get used to it since it was a beauty just a moment ago, before she turned into an old dragon in the next second.

“Do you wish to carry on your challenge?” The dragon spirit looked at Lin Yun.

“There’s no need.” Lin Yun shook his head. He roughly knew his strength in his fight with Bai Liuying. She was in the same generation as him, and Lin Yun was forced to use several trump cards in this fight.

There was no longer a meaning for him to carry on challenging the Elysium Core Ranking. Lin Yun felt that if he used his full strength, he could make it into the top thirty. He wasn’t in a hurry to leave, so he looked through the information of those ranked in the top hundredths on the Elysium Core Ranking.

In the top hundredths, there were only eighteen, including Bai Liuying, who were under the age of fifty, and there were only ten under the age of thirty. The person who was ranked first was named Huang Xuanyi, but there wasn’t much information about him except his age of thirty-five. So he could also be considered to be part of the younger generation.

Dripping a droplet of blood and choosing to maintain anonymity, Lin Yun ended his challenge. Thinking that someone else might challenge him was interesting.

“If I’m defeated by someone else, does that mean that my name will disappear from the rankings, and I’ll have to challenge it again?” Lin Yun asked.

“Not exactly,” said the dragon spirit. “If you defeat someone with a higher ranking on the Elysium Core Ranking outside, I will also receive the information and change your ranking.”

“I see… I’ll take my leave, then.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together.

But just when he was about to leave, the dragon spirit’s voice resounded behind him, “Brat, don’t die. The Blue Dragon Ranking will soon appear, recording the names of all the heroes in the world. There’s a high possibility that your name might also be recorded on it.”

Lin Yun briefly paused when he heard that before he continued forth.

“How is it?” An Liuyan asked when she saw Lin Yun coming out.

“Ranked 100.” Lin Yun replied.

“Not bad… wait! What did you say? Ranked 100?!” An Liuyan smiled before her face turned into shock. She wondered if she had heard him correctly because Lin Yun was ranked 100 in his first challenge. One must know that when they left Azurerock City, Lin Yun was only at the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, and he couldn’t even make it into the top two thousandths back then.

“Not bad, I guess.” Lin Yun calmly replied. “I need to sort out my strength systematically and excavate more from the Blue Dragon Bone. After I’m done, it shouldn’t be an issue for me to make it into the top ten.”

Suddenly, Lin Yun sensed something and took out his Sword Sect medal. An aged and prestigious voice from the medal resounded, “I’m fine.”

That voice naturally came from the Radiant Sword Saint. When Lin Yun lowered the medal, he breathed a sigh of relief.

“What’s the matter?”

“Good news.” Lin Yun smiled.

Seven days later, Lin Yun left Aquabarren City with 25,000 kilograms of True Dragon Saint Liquid. He had left the Sword Sect for close to four months. Four months wasn’t long, but the experience within the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm made it feel like a long time had passed.

During this period, he ran into all sorts of trouble and danger. It was so much so that he even needed his master’s help to resolve the crisis. But fortunately, he survived the ordeal, and his harvest far exceeded his imagination.

After returning to the Sword Sect, he had to go into seclusion to finish learning the Carefree 9 Swords and refine the Netherflower. At that time, his strength would undergo a drastic transformation. If he could make a breakthrough in his strength, he was confident he could become first on the Elysium Core Ranking.

After leaving the city gate, Lin Yun pushed his movement technique to the limit and traveled at lightning speed. Two days passed, and the entire journey was smooth. He only needed another day to enter the range of the Sword Sect, so Lin Yun pushed his speed further, since he was feeling anxious.

Suddenly, Lin Yun looked down and saw an old fisherman fishing on the lake. This gave Lin Yun a bad feeling because this was weird. But just when he was feeling uncertain, an elderly voice echoed within his ears, “Young lad, why don’t you come down and chat with me?”

This strengthened Lin Yun’s doubt, making him more alert. But Lin Yun ultimately descended and walked towards the fisherman.

“Haha, Flower Burial is really bold to come down, not knowing if I’m a friend or enemy.” The old fisherman said with his back facing Lin Yun.

This surprised Lin Yun. Many knew his title as Flower Burial in the Profound Amber Realm, but not many knew about it in the Kunlun Realm. At the very least, few people knew about that title in the Ancient Barren Domain. So Lin Yun felt uneasy when he heard someone addressing him by that title, and he replied, “I won’t be able to leave if you’re determined to force me to stay. So I might as well come down and see who you are.”

“Haha. I’m an acquaintance!”

“You know me?” Lin Yun became even more alert. There was something fishy about this fisherman who called him by his title when he was right outside the range of the Sword Sect.

“I naturally do.”

“You’re waiting for me here.”

“I’m fishing, but no fish is taking the bait for some reason.” The old fisherman said. Suddenly the fishing line trembled. Ripples spread across the lake, and an eerie aura began to spread.

“It’s coming! Haha, you’re really my fortune star!” The old fisherman rejoiced when he saw this scene, and he started a tug-of-war with the fish in the lake. God knows what had taken the bait because the fishing line was fully stretched.

As the old fisherman pulled the fishing rod, the lake exploded, and a ‘fish’ breached the lake's surface.

“Senior Brother!” Lin Yun yelled. That was no fish, but a person, his senior brother, Feng Jue!
