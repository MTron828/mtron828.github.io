Chapter 1557 - Pitiful Tiger

“Roger that, Lord Lin.” The Demonic Rune Tiger squeezed out a humble smile before it retreated.

“Hehe, that tiger is pretty adorable.” Lil’ Purple came over and picked up a fruit to examine. Lil’ Red also ran over, wanting to eat the fruit. But Lil’ Purple knocked on its head, “It’s not for you. You’re not allowed to eat.”

The pain made Lil’ Red rub its head as it wailed out, looking at the fruits pitifully. This scene made Lin Yun laugh. But when he laughed, he was interrupted as a fruit was shoved into his mouth.

“What are you laughing at? Look at you. You’re no different from a skeleton!” Lil’ Purple shoved the fruit into Lin Yun’s mouth and made him swallow it.

When Lin Yun swallowed the fruit, it was swiftly converted into boundless vitality. This made Lin Yun’s eyes light up as he continued to throw one fruit after another into his mouth. His vitality was rapidly being replenished, and his body was swiftly recovering. His pale face became rosy as he circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art to refine the fruits into vitality.

In just a brief moment, the terrifying vitality exploded within his body, making his body burn up like a volcano as a massive dragon aura swept out. The sudden outburst caught Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red by surprise and they were sent flying away. Lil’ Red spun its body in mid-air before landing on the back of the Demonic Rune Tiger.

The Demonic Rune Tiger was initially happy while looking at Lin Yun devouring the fruits, but it suddenly stopped smiling when Lil’ Red fell on its back.

Since the dragon aura had been significantly suppressed within his body for a long time, it suddenly spiraled out of Lin Yun’s control and exploded. As waves of dragon aura exploded from Lin Yun, it soared to the sky, and Lin Yun made so much more improvements in the Azure Dragon Saint Art that had already reached perfection.

“This feels great!” Lin Yun opened his eyes as a smile rose on his lips. Right then, he had utterly refined the Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits. When he spread his arms apart, the Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits appeared on each palm and started blazing. This made Lin Yun look like he was lifting a sun and moon with his hands.

“Combine!” Lin Yun suddenly clasped his hands together before his chest. The commotion created sounded like two exploding stars when they collided and soon spread throughout his body from his arms.

But his hard work over the last month was crucial. Without that, he wouldn’t have succeeded. After basking the spirits with the dragon blood, the tough metal spirits began to dissolve into liquid form, appearing to be alive. The Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits separated and coursed within his body.

Lin Yun felt that they were becoming a part of his body. In the end, the two spirits separated and entered his pupils. The Glorysun Spirit entered his left eye, and the Glorymoon Spirit entered his right eye. They were like seeds planted deep within his eyes as the dragon blood blazed.

As the Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits blazed within his pupils, they were constantly fusing into his eyes. Blood dripped down his eyesockets when he closed his eyes, and his dragon aura increased once more, reaching an unbelievable height. It was as if he would turn into a genuine dragon the next moment.

“Oh my god. Just what kind of monster is Lord Lin?” The Dragon Rune Tiger was scared silly as it fell onto its knees, and its eyes nearly fell out of their sockets.

As a violet gale blew out, Lil’ Purple had concern in her pupils as she exclaimed, “He won’t go blind, right?”

Lil’ Purple finally panicked because she had agreed to let Lin Yun learn this dragon spirit martial technique. If anything happened to Lin Yun, she would blame herself for it. After all, dragon spirit martial techniques were powerful, even if the crucial part was missing. It still wasn’t something ordinary people could try to cultivate. If Lin Yun didn’t cultivate the Azure Dragon Saint Art, the dragon blood section would’ve been enough to kill other cultivators ninety-nine percent of the time.

“His cultivation is too low.” Lil’ Purple furrowed her brows. Or rather, this fist technique was too overbearing. For Dragon Pulse Realm experts, it was a transformation for them to condense every single dragon pulse. But even so, their eyes were still their weakness.

Only after reaching the Samsara Edict Realm would their eyes not become their weakness. Lin Yun’s cultivation wasn’t high, but his physique wasn’t weak. His physique was comparable to geniuses at the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

But the name Sovereign Dragon Fist sounds familiar to her, for some reason. She had a feeling that she had heard it elsewhere. Suddenly, her eyes lit up, and she recalled where she had heard it from. The Sovereign Dragon Fist was a long-lost martial technique of the Dragon Clan and was known for being more violent than the Imperial Dragon Fist. The Imperial Dragon Fist was known as the Dragon Clan’s most powerful offensive fist technique.

“I shouldn’t have let Lin Yun practice it.” Lil’ Purple finally regretted it. When she saw this fist technique was incomplete earlier, she didn’t think it was a problem because it could only be considered a powerful ghost spirit martial technique, at best. In reality, most ghost spirit martial techniques were derived from dragon spirit martial techniques, allowing cultivators with lower cultivation to practice them.

Such a ghost spirit martial technique had a high threshold. The threshold might not be comparable to top-tiered ghost spirit martial techniques, but it had a high limit that could break through the boundaries of ghost spirit martial techniques. In a nutshell, it was dangerous to practice and had a high threshold in exchange for having a high limit.

The Sovereign Dragon Fist was a great example because it had a terrifying high threshold. So Lil’ Purple was worried that Lin Yun would lose his eyes. Even if Lin Yun managed to become a saint, it would be hard for him to pursue the higher dao as long as he was incomplete.

“I made a mistake.” Lil’ Purple squatted down and started crying.

God knows how long later, a hand fell onto her head, and a voice resounded, “Why are you crying here?”

Lil’ Purple brawled when she heard that voice and hugged his waist, “I’m sorry. I promise I’ll find you a pair of powerful eyes as a replacement. I’m sorry about that!”

“What are you talking about? Why are you speaking as though I’m blind?” Lin Yun laughed.

“You’re not blind?” Lil’ Purple was briefly stunned and raised her head. When she looked at Lin Yun, there was nothing wrong with his eyes, and he didn’t lose them. Lin Yun’s pupils were shining brightly while looking like two abysses. Paired with his dragon aura, they looked like a pair of dragon pupils.

“You’re a phoenix. So why are you always crying?” Lin Yun scraped her nose with a smile.

“Hmph. I’m not crying. It’s just that the wind is too big.” Lil’ Purple argued, her face blushing.

“Alright. It’s all because of the wind!” Lin Yun couldn’t help laughing.

“You’re not allowed to laugh, or I’ll be angry!” Lil’ Purple said solemnly.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Alright, alright. I’ll stop laughing.” Lin Yun squinted his pupils and carried Lil’ Purple before walking toward the stone monument.

Lil’ Purple briefly struggled. But when she realized she couldn’t break free, she ultimately sat on Lin Yun’s shoulders and grabbed onto his neck to prevent herself from falling. When Lin Yun stood before the stone monument, he examined the missing portion of the Sovereign Dragon Fist.

It was perilous earlier because he nearly lost his eyes. But in the critical moment, the divine rune in the Blue Dragon Bone saved his life. As boundless vitality poured towards his pupils, it kept him from losing his eyes.

“I finally know why the Sovereign Dragon Fist requires to refine the glory spirits.” Lin Yun muttered as he looked at the stone monument.

“Why?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Dragon aura.” Lin Yun explained. “Regardless of a cultivator’s aura or demonic beast’s aura, it has to be released through the eyes. I might have a dragon bone, but my eyes are ultimately the eyes of a human. So no matter how proficient I am with the Azure Dragon Saint Art, my dragon aura still can’t transform.”

Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up because that made sense, and she had never thought of it before. In the past, the dragon aura was fake, no matter how powerful it was, even after being empowered by the Blue Dragon Bone. But it was completely different now.

After the Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits basked in dragon blood and were planted deep within his pupils, he finally had a pair of dragon eyes that had combined with the Blue Dragon Bone. But regardless of the Glorysun or Glorymoon Spirits within his pupils, they could only be considered seeds for now.

This meant that he had to refine them in the future to unleash a divine dragon's aura even without the Blue Dragon Bone. As of now, he wanted to give it a try.

“Lil’ Tiger, look at me!” Lin Yun circulated the Blue Dragon Bone. When he poured the dragon aura into his eyes, he turned to look at the Demonic Rune Tiger with a smile.

“Ah?” The Demonic Rune Tiger was a little stumped. But as it raised its head and came in contact with Lin Yun’s eyes, it suddenly felt an unimaginable pressure as if it was looking at a divine dragon. It could see starry skies in Lin Yun’s pupils like a sun and moon.

The Demonic Rune Tiger had activated the Tiger King Bone. But no matter how it tried, it couldn’t change anything. In the end, the Demonic Rune Tiger threw out three mouthfuls of blood before collapsing on the ground, wondering what it had done wrong.
