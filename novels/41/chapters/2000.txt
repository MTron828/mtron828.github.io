Chapter 2001 - Great Boost In Strength!

“What do you want?” Lil’ Red coldly looked at the Indigocloth Venerable and her eight god generals.

Bai Qingyu was crippled now, so she looked nervous.

The Indigocloth Venerable was briefly surprised before she smiled, “A cat that talks! You even seem pretty intelligent. Are you interested in becoming my bet?”

“You becoming my pet seems more like it. You’re nothing compared to my big brother,” Lil’ Red snorted. Since Lil’ Red often stayed with Lil’ Purple, it naturally picked up Lil’ Purple’s bad habits, such as asking someone to be their servant.

“Still thinking about your old master? I bet you don’t know that Ye Qingtian was heavily injured in his fight with Xiao Jingyan, and he can’t be bothered with you guys now,” the Indigocloth Venerable smiled. She had been watching Ye Qingtian and Xiao Jingyan fight in the dark with the eight god generals. She wanted to come out after they were both heavily injured, but Ye Qingtian and Xiao Jingyan’s strength far exceeded her expectations.

Thus, she came up with the plan of capturing Bai Qingyu. With Bai Qingyu in her hands, Ye Qingtian could only listen obediently, no matter how strong he was. She wanted to know why Ye Qingtian came to the Myriad Graves Valley and his real identity.

When Bai Qingyu heard that Ye Qingtian was heavily injured, she became nervous and asked, “What happened to Ye Qingtian?”

“It doesn’t matter if he’s really injured or fake injured. As long as you’re in my hands, he can only become obedient,” the Indigocloth Venerable smiled.

Bai Qingyu squinted her pupils, her face becoming pale. She instantly figured out what the Indigocloth Venerable was planning.

“Die!” Lil’ Red’s face became cold as it turned into a black streak of light, charging at the Indigocloth Venerable. Its claws were razor sharp, even sharper than ordinary saint artifacts, and its claws were targeted at the Indigocloth Venerable’s heart.

The Indigocloth Venerable was surprised, and she began to move, leaving behind afterimages around her. When she landed on the ground, she discovered blood on her clothes. Her face instantly became cold, and she said, “What a powerful cat. You have given me a huge surprise.”

Despite being able to injure the Indigocloth Venerable, Lil’ Red didn’t look happy at all. The Indigocloth Venerable only suffered superficial wounds; which she could easily recover from with her nirvana aura. But it would be harder for Lil’ Red to attack anymore.

Lil’ Red didn’t hesitate and dashed forth, charging at the god generals. When its claws came in contact with their Nethermoon Saint Armor, they left behind sparks, but the armor was unscathed under its claws. Glory Saint Artifacts like the Nethermoon Saint Armor were too terrifyingly tough.

The god generals then dashed forth, each throwing a punch to force Lil’ Red back. Lil’ Red had a fast speed, but it still took an attack head-on.

The Indigocloth Venerable smiled upon seeing this, “You’re really bold. My eight god generals can even fight against a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase if they join forces.”

“Let’s go!” Lil’ Red retreated and grabbed onto Bai Qingyu before fleeing. Even at its strongest state, Lil’ Red only had a 40% chance of beating the eight god generals, which wasn’t including the Indigocloth Venerable. The Indigocloth Venerable was clearly more mysterious and powerful.

“Haha, do you think you can leave? Chase after them!” The Indigocloth Venerable smiled, calmly ordering the eight god generals to chase after Lil’ Red and Bai Qingyu.

In a forest far away. Xiao Jingyan stood on a tree, watching the Indigocloth Venerable and eight god generals. His face became sinister, with murderous intent flashing on his face. He furiously clenched his fist, “Wang Muyan, so you’ve really fooled me!”

He now knew that the Indigocloth Venerable and eight god generals were happily watching as he fought Ye Qingtian, waiting for them to be heavily injured. After a brief pondering, Xiao Jing decided not to appear. Since these people felt he was heavily injured and couldn’t deal with Ye Qingtian, he would just sit and watch.

Xiao Jingyan had already recovered from his injuries. After fighting Ye Qingtian, Xiao Jingyan briefly pondered and felt it best not to clash with Ye Qingtian head-on.

Lin Yun felt that Xiao Jingyan was tough to deal with, and Xiao Jingyan felt the same way. Ye Qingtian was only at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, but Ye Qingtian’s sword techniques could heavily injure Xiao Jingyan if he weren’t careful. With a rough analysis, he instantly figured out that Ye Qingtian still had trump cards.

It was easy to defeat Ye Qingtian, but it was practically impossible to kill him. Ye Qingtian had too many trump cards, and he could leave anytime. That’s why Xiao Jingyan wanted to strike Ye Qingtian’s weaknesses and tried to look for Bai Qingyu, but Bai Qingyu was first found by the Indigocloth Venerable instead.

“I’ll be watching the show this time,” Xiao Jingyan smiled.

One and a half years passed within the Three-Lives Realm, and Lin Yun was enveloped by his nirvana aura, which formed into a vivid-looking Heavenly Dragon and a Divine Phoenix that coiled around him. As nirvana aura poured into Lin Yun’s body, cracks appeared within the Three-Lives Realm. In the end, the Three-Lives Realm crumbled, and Lin Yun appeared in reality with the Three-Lives Fruit in his hand becoming dim.

“I can’t use this Three-Lives Fruit anymore, but it has helped me greatly.” Lin Yun relied on the Three-Lives Fruit to reach his current cultivation from the Profound Death Stage. Others thought he relied on the saint origin to become so powerful, but it was actually the Three-Lives Fruit. But now, the Three-Lives Fruit has fulfilled its duty.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

It had only been a few months since Lin Yun joined the Heavenly Dao Sect, and he went from the Profound Death Stage to the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage. That’s right, relying on the resources given to him by the Serene Dust Great Saint, Lin Yun reached the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage using one and a half years in the Three-Lives Realm.

His strength would undergo a significant boost with each breakthrough, and his nirvana aura reached three hundred and fifty thousand strands. It had increased more than a fold, thanks to the Saint Dragon Pellet and eighth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid, which had been completely refined within his body.

The Serene Dust Great Saint was too good to him and practically treated him like a son, providing him with all sorts of resources. Eighth-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid was formed using the blood of lesser dragons, and Lin Yun was given an entire bowl to drink like soup. Not to mention the Serene Dust Great Saint even had to watch Lin Yun drink it before leaving.

“Seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage. If I reach the eighth transformation, my nirvana aura will probably reach five hundred thousand,” Lin Yun muttered with his eyes squinted. The last three transformations of the Nirvana Stage were important, and each breakthrough would greatly boost his strength.

“But it’s a pity I still can’t refine the three strands of azure flames.” Lin Yun looked at the three strands of flames condensed of sword intent. The phenomenon they created enveloped half the Heavenly Dao Sect when it appeared.

Lin Yun closed his eyes and let his nirvana aura fill his body. He was digesting and stabilizing his current cultivation.

Four hours later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and flicked his finger, unleashing a dragon roar. His Azure Dragon Intent had fused with his nirvana aura, forming a massive azure dragon made up of nirvana aura, charging forth and destroying dozens of trees in front of him.

This brought a smile to Lin Yun’s face because the trees in the Myriad Graves Valley were even tougher than saint physiques. He suddenly drew his sword and unleashed a dazzling sword ray, “Sword of the Beginning!”

In the path of the sword ray, even space had collapsed, distorting the surrounding space. The nearly towering trees and rocks on the ground were all swept into the distorted space. A brief moment later, they were spat out from the distorted space into small pieces. This was because Lin Yun had improved in this sword technique that he created.

“Let me see how you’ll dodge my sword this time!” Lin Yun gritted his teeth. He managed to land a hit with this sword technique on Xiao Jingyan, but the latter relied on his Demonspirit’s physique to avoid his vitals. Xiao Jingyan even mocked him for it, and Lin Yun naturally, clearly remembered it.

Lin Yun spent most of his time perfecting this sword technique within the Three-Lives Realm, aside from cultivating, and that was to take revenge. His sword technique wasn’t as simple as compressing the surrounding space.

Lin Yun’s path as a swordsman was to keep surpassing himself. At the same time, Lin Yun now had an idea of how to develop this sword technique. He could go with the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, animals, and even a civilization! At that time, the intent within his sword would be brought to a height that no one could reach.

“This is my path as a swordsman. The Divine Firefly Sword might be strong, but the Sword Ancestor created it. It doesn’t belong to me alone.” Lin Yun’s gaze was firm, and he was confident he could one day surpass the Sword Ancestor with the Sword of the Beginning.

“Time to look for Lil’ Red,” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the Iris Secret Realm.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun nodded.

Just when Lil’ Purple was going to point out a direction for Lin Yun, a crimson firework exploded in the sky a thousand miles away. When the firework bloomed, it became a dark lotus that soon disappeared.

“It’s Bai Qingyu. She’s in danger!” Lin Yun instantly recognized it as the rescue signal of the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s saint disciple.

“It might be a trap,” Lil’ Purple commented. She didn’t have a good impression of Bai Qingyu.
