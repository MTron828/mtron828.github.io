Chapter 967 - All Killed In A Single Wave

When the cold voice sounded out, everyone paid attention. They were curious to see who was bold enough to provoke Shi Ming with seven higher realms present.

But Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu, who had already accepted their fate, instantly recognized the voice. They became emotional as hope filled their eyes. However, their eyes grew a little sad because it would be hard for Lin Yun to help them with all of the higher realms in the surroundings.

Furthermore, Lin Yun might fall into danger because of them. They couldn’t stand the thought of that because Lin Yun was the hope of the Profound Amber Realm. Full of anxiety, they wanted to tell Lin Yun to run away for now. However, they were so injured that they couldn’t make a sound.

But when Lin Yun saw this scene from the sky, he instantly knew what they were trying to do and became enraged.

“It’s Lin Yun!” Someone from the seven higher realms recognized Lin Yun’.

“I was wondering who dared to be arrogant. So it’s you.” Shi Ming slowly lowered his hand. But as he spoke, his eyes flashed with disdain. He heard rumors of Lin Yun being so arrogant that he overlooked the higher realms.

Although Lin Yun’s strength was impressive, everyone knew that the Bloodbone Realm and Blazeyang Realm were hunting him down. Shi Ming was certain that Lin Yun was running away and wouldn’t dare to provoke him. Furthermore, Lin Yun was from a lower realm and Shi Ming was from a higher realm.

“Lin Yun, this has nothing to do with us. We’re not the ones who captured your friends.”

“This has nothing to do with our Heavenly Desert Realm either.”

“It has nothing to do with my Scarlet Hawk Realm.”

“......” One by one, the leaders of the higher realms tried to declare their innocence. They seemed to be especially afraid of Lin Yun as they awaited Lin Yun’s judgment. It was a bizarre scene for the crowd.

But there was no change on Lin Yun’s face. He had a guess that the leaders of the higher realms heard that he killed Liu Mu, Mo Yan, Xu Que, and Mu Ziyi.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun said coldly. “You better pray that you’re telling the truth. Otherwise, I’ll hunt you down to the ends of the earth!”

The killing intent in Lin Yun’s voice sent chills down everyone’s spines. However, no one dared to retaliate. Instead, the leaders of the higher realms cupped their hands and quickly left. They didn’t even spare the astral palace a glance.

Just like that, six higher realms disappeared into thin air. Everyone was completely dumbfounded. Did Lin Yun just tell six higher realms to get lost? It was even more shocking that the six higher realms left.

Just like that, only the Azure Rainbow Realm was left behind. This made Shi Ming’s face change as panic flashed through his pupils. He knew that the leaders of the six higher realms knew something he didn’t. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have left. He started to curse because no one gave him a heads up.

He could also tell that Lin Yun’s aura was a bit suffocating. No matter what the reason was, he knew that he couldn’t stay here anymore. Rolling his eyes around, Shi Ming smiled, “Lin Yun, I’ll give you some face and leave. I can also let your friends go.”

Without any hesitation, he waved his hand and loosened the restraints on Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu. The moment the restraints loosened, all three of them vomited blood before barely managing to stand up.

“Farewell.” Shi Ming waved his hand as if he was giving Lin Yun face.

“Did I permit you to leave?” But when he turned around, a cold voice sounded out with boundless killing intent.

When Shi Ming heard that, his face sank and he turned around to look at Lin Yun, “Lin Yun, don’t push it. I’ve already released your friends and given up on this astral palace’s inheritance. What else do you want? Don’t force me to go all out because that won’t benefit you!”

Everyone could tell that Shi Ming was truly enraged as he spoke in a threatening tone.

With a smirk, Lin Yun spoke coldly, “You really think highly of yourself. Why don’t you try and do something? I’ll wait.”

Lin Yun’s words made Shi Ming’s face pale. He roared, “You bastard, don’t you know your current situation? Liu Mu and Mo Yan are hunting you down. If I remember correctly, Xu Que is also unhappy with you. You can’t even save your own ass, yet you want to get involved with my Azure Rainbow Realm?”

“So what?” Lin Yun replied.

“You’re courting death!” Shi Ming finally lost it after seeing Lin Yun’s attitude. “Lin Yun, you must be courting death. Since you dared to provoke my Azure Rainbow Realm even after offending so many higher realms, you can’t blame me for what’s about to happen!”

Circulating all his aura oceans, a powerful surge of origin energy gushed out. Shi Ming pushed his cultivation to the limit, but he clearly had no idea how strong the current Lin Yun was.

Shi Ming charged towards Lin Yun and threw his punch out, unleashing all the origin energy gathered in his fist. Like a roaring dragon, Shi Ming’s attack made the ground tremble as it flew towards Lin Yun.

But something unexpected happened. Lin Yun grabbed hold of Shi Ming’s punch. He didn’t even bat an eye when he did this. The crowd was confused when they saw this. They were certain that the attack would cause a huge commotion.

“This is all of your strength?” Lin Yun sneered in disdain, which left Shi Ming with fear. He turned around and ran as fast as he could.

“Come back!” Lin Yun barked and reached out with his hand. A powerful suction force exploded from his palm that dragged Shi Ming back.

“No, no, no…” Shi Ming started screaming. But no matter how he screamed, he couldn’t resist. In the end, Lin Yun threw him into the ground like a sandbag, causing the ground to crack and Shi Ming’s back to shatter. The sound of Shi Ming’s bones cracking made the crowd squirm with fear.

As Shi Ming vomited blood, his face became distorted with pain. Lin Yun slowly approached him with boundless killing intent, which caused the heavens and earth to tremble.

Looking at Lin Yun in fear, Shi Ming used his hands to start crawling backwards and said in a trembling voice, “Lin Yun, what do you want? I can give you anything. Just don’t come near me…”

Shi Ming was completely terrified at this moment.

“Your life,” said Lin Yun coldly.

“No, no, no! Don’t kill me…don’t kill me…” Shi Ming lost his mind when he heard Lin Yun’s response. Fear loomed over his heart as he panicked. If he could get up on his feet right now, he would kneel and beg for his life. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

But no matter how he begged, he couldn’t change Lin Yun’s mind. “Oh, I forgot to tell you. I already killed Liu Mu, Mo Yan, and Xu Que,” said Lin Yun.

What?! Shi Ming’s mind became blank when he heard that. At this moment, he finally now knew why the other higher realms backed off when they saw Lin Yun. But before Shi Ming could even react, Lin Yun grabbed Shi Ming and punched him.

When Shi Ming took the punch, he burst into a mist of blood. The scene was so scary that the cultivators from the Azure Rainbow Realm fled for their lives.

However, Lin Yun’s mood didn’t improve even after killing Shi Ming. He could forgive the remnants of the Bloodbone Realm, but not these people. After all, these people tortured his friends.

“Die!” Lin Yun barked as he flicked his finger. Hundreds of Iris Flowers bloomed behind him with countless sword rays. The sword rays instantly killed everyone who was fleeing. Just like that, the entire Azure Rainbow Realm was eradicated.

The spectators were in disbelief. Their shock was indescribable. No matter how much they reasoned with themselves, they couldn’t imagine a scenario where Lin Yun erased an entire higher realm from the Heavenly Path with a wave of his hand.
