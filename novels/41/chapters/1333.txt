Chapter 1334 - Golden Dragon Aura

Mu Qingqing finally felt relieved when she heard what Sikong Zhou said. At the same time, a smile also returned to her face because she knew that Sikong Zhou wasn’t affected by his loss against Qin Cang. If he was affected, then there would be a flaw in his heart, which would equate to a flaw in his sword technique as a swordsman. This would also greatly affect him when he wanted to make a breakthrough in the future.

The Sword Sect’s disciples and elders then headed towards the pagoda. Like the other powerful sects, they all wore grave expressions and were hesitating. The Profound Valley’s Tang Jing and Heavenly Note Sect’s Luo Shuyi were standing together. Since they had formed an alliance, they naturally had to make a decision.

A long time later, Tang Jing asked, “So, are we still going to compete for it?”

Luo Shuyi’s brows were locked together, but she wouldn’t blame Tang Jing if he wanted to back out. After all, since Qin Cang had already said those words, this meant that he definitely wouldn’t go easy on those who wanted to compete with him for the Great Saint Origin.

“He shouldn’t have used his full strength earlier. At most, he only used one-third of his strength when he fought Lin Yun.” Tang Jing fell into a brief silence before he continued, “I’m a spiritualist, and I can sense the astral energy within his body. He seems to have undergone a transformation after reaching the Elysium Core Realm, and that’s…”

“What is it?” Luo Shuyi asked.

“Golden dragon aura,” said Tang Jing in an uncertain tone. He speculated that Qin Cang must’ve cultivated a dragon clan’s cultivation technique. After reaching the Elysium Core realm, all the astral energy within his body was converted into the ‘golden dragon aura’.

The ‘golden dragon aura’ was still within the scope of astral energy, just that it was of a higher quality and thus, making it stronger. If Qin Cang had used it earlier, he would definitely be able to suppress his opponents easily.

Only by practicing a cultivation technique above holy spirit grade and reaching a certain level in it, could one convert their astral energy into something even more powerful. But generally speaking, even if one had a corresponding cultivation technique, they had to reach the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm before they could try and convert their astral energy or their bodies wouldn’t be able to endure the strain.

This was why Tang Jing wasn’t absolutely certain about what he said. If he knew that the Demonflame Lotus that Qin Cang refined contained a droplet of true dragon’s blood, then he wouldn’t say it in an uncertain tone.

“Since that’s the case, we won’t compete over it, then.” Luo Shuyi nodded her head.

Hearing that, Tang Jing smiled. “Yeah, living is better. It’ll be a huge loss if we die in the hands of Qin Cang.”

For someone like them, they wouldn’t change their minds the moment they entered the pagoda.

“Do you think Lin Yun has a chance?” Luo Shuyi suddenly asked. She didn’t need to guess to know that Lin Yun would definitely compete for the Great Saint Origin, so she asked if Lin Yun would stand a chance.

“He won’t stand a chance, and he’s actually a dead person from the moment he caught Qin Cang’s attention. If I were him, I’d try and leave now. After all, he’s the strongest genius in the Heavenly Paths, and this means that he is blessed with a huge fortune. If he lays low, for now, he might be able to rise in the future,” said Tang Jing. He had to be honest that even he was envious of Lin Yun.

Since ancient times, champions of the Heavenly Paths would definitely become saints as long as they didn’t die along the way. So many people guessed that the Heavenly Paths contained a lot of fortune from the Divine Dragon Era. Otherwise, it would make no sense why all the champions of the Heavenly Paths managed to rise in the end.

“What’s the matter? You’re worried about him?” Tang Jing smiled.

“A friend of mine asked me to take care of him. Furthermore, does he look like someone who had just descended to the Kunlun Realm for less than a year?” Luo Shuyi replied.

“Mu Qingqing?” Tang Jing was curious. After all, Mu Qingqing was known for her connections, and her relationship with the other sects was great as well. This was the reason why he instantly thought of Mu Qingqing.

“Not her,” replied Luo Shuyi.

“From outside the Ancient Barren Domain?” Tang jing fell into deep thoughts because the Heavenly Note Sect was special and their inheritance wasn’t only in the Ancient Barren Domain.

Luo Shuyi nodded her head as an acknowledgment, but she said nothing else.

Tang Jing briefly pondered before he replied, “Let’s see how it goes, then. We won’t compete for the Great Saint Origin, and I also can’t be bothered with him. But I won’t watch and do nothing if you’re in danger.”

What he actually meant was that since Luo Shuyi decided to help Lin Yun, then he would help her. Then again, there was another hidden meaning as well, but that would require Luo Shuyi to think about it herself. She was smart, and she could naturally figure it out. But it would be another question if she would give him her response.

“Let’s go, then.” Luo Shuyi didn’t say much and headed towards the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda.

“Move out!” Tang Jing hollered to those from the Profound Valley, following Luo Shuyi. Looking at this scene, the ladies from the Heavenly Note Sect all wore smiles on their faces.

As for the other powerful sects, they were still discussing their decisions. After all, it was the Great Saint Origin they were talking about, and it was hard for them to give up on it. Then again, they also had to be concerned with Qin Cang’s declaration.

In the end, many sects made the same decision as Tang Jing. They had already received a huge harvest on the Profound Wither Island, and this meant that there was no need for them to continue to take the risk. After all, everything would come to an end if they died in the hands of Qin Cang. As long as they were still alive, they would have a chance to catch up to Qin Cang, no matter how slim the chance was.

“Cang Yun, are we still going to compete for the Great Saint Origin?” Only the Vajra Monastery hadn’t made its decision. Their Greater Elysium Core Realm experts were all looking at the bald youth who was leading the party.

“Why do we have to be afraid? It’s just a fight.” Cang Yun rubbed his head and revealed a devilish smile. When he didn’t speak, he looked like a venerable monk. But the moment he opened his mouth, it would give him a demonic trait.

The lips of the other Elysium Core Realm experts from the Vajra Monastery twitched when they heard that, but they didn’t have any changes on their faces. Clearly, they were already used to it.

As countless figures headed for the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda, they were all rushing to enter.

Far away, two figures slowly came over. They were Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan. Their speed was slow, and Gongsun Yan looked anxious. But since he was together with Zhao Yan, they couldn’t travel fast at all.

At this moment, Zhao Yan was swaying from left to right with no light in his eyes. His facial features were also stiff without any emotions, so it wasn’t exaggerating to say that he was a fool at this moment.

Gongsun Yan wasn’t surprised about that, and this wasn’t the first time they had interacted. Whenever Zhao Yan was in this state, this meant that he had obtained a new sword technique. So before he fully comprehended it, he would be in this dazed state, and he would spend all his time comprehending sword technique. This was also the reason why he was called a sword fanatic.

“Hey, fool. The Great Saint Origin has appeared, so hurry up!” Gongsun Yan finally couldn’t hold it back anymore and patted Zhao Yan’s shoulder, causing the latter to sway, and light gradually returned to his eyes.

But Zhao Yan’s expression was still stiff as he muttered to himself, “Great Saint Origin?”

“That’s right, the Great Saint Origin.” Gongsun Yan’s eyes were blazing with excitement while looking at the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda.

“But what has it got to do with you? Even Lin Yun lost to Qin Cang.”

“Huh? What do you mean?!”

“You’ll immediately kneel when facing Qin Cang.”

Hearing that, Gongsun Yan was so furious that his lips became crooked. “The Profound Sky Sect can only rely on Qin Cang. If it’s only Lei Jue and Xuan Ying, I might have a chance against them. They only know how to rely on Qin Cang’s fame, so they better not run into me.”

But when he turned back, he saw that Zhao Yan returned to his dazed state and began to shake him.

“This fellow…” Gongsun Yan’s face became black and patted Zhao Yan’s shoulder, “The pagoda doesn’t only have the Great Saint Origin, and there might be powerful sword techniques in there as well.”

“That’s right!” Zhao Yan recovered from his state with light shining in his pupils as he swayed from left to right. But the rate of his swaying became a lot faster, and he would appear a thousand meters away with every sway.

In just a few breaths’ time, Zhao Yan was already ten-odd miles away, and he was faintly enveloped in a sacred light whenever he swayed. At the same time, a sword vibration would echo out above his head and sword rays could be faintly seen.

Looking at this scene, Gongsun Yan couldn’t help rubbing his eyes and was completely dumbfounded, “Don’t tell me this fool is really training his sword? This also works?”

In just such a brief moment, Zhao Yan was already far away and Gongsun Yan could only chase after him.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun and the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s disciples had already approached the pagoda with the rest of the crowd. The gate was open, and there were countless people entering.

“Such pure sacred light. Is this the saint aura emitted from the Great Saint Origin?”

“Even if there’s nothing in the pagoda, just the saint aura alone is enough for me to make a breakthrough!”

“This is the last opportunity on the Profound Wither Island, so we can’t miss it!” Everyone who was entering the pagoda was excited and quickened their pace into the pagoda.

“There’s something weird about this light.” Lin Yun said while sensing the light as he entered the pagoda. But when he didn’t get any reply, he turned back to see that Su Ziyao and the rest had already disappeared.

Taking out the token from the Fleeting cloud Sword Sect, Lin Yun tried to contact Ye Ziling and the rest but he was disappointed because he couldn’t activate it at all. This meant that they were all isolated upon entering the pagoda.

“Lil’ Purple?”

“Empress?”

“Supreme Heavenly Slaughtering Empress?”

Lin Yun tried calling out and Lil’ Purple’s annoyed voice finally sounded out from the sword box after a brief moment, “I’m here. No need to keep calling me. You’re right, there’s something weird about the saint aura. But don’t worry about it for now because you have not officially entered the pagoda. There should be tests left behind by the Profound Wither Great Saint in there.”

“Tests?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Yeah. The Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda is a divine artifact, even if it did lose the profound amber. So not just anyone can enter it.”

Lin Yun was silent and could sense a dense vitality and sun-moon essence in the surroundings. Even if he did nothing, his cultivation would still improve greatly. As he continued to walk forth, he waited for the tests to arrive.

An hour later, the surrounding space suddenly trembled, and there was a dazzling light that made everyone close their eyes. When his sight returned to him, Lin Yun could see a black and white lotus ahead of him, and there was a person seated on the lotus, enveloped in a black and white aura.

That person was blurred, and Lin Yun could only roughly see his outline. When that person’s appearance cleared up, Lin Yun saw a familiar face and was briefly shocked.

Before he could even recover from his shock, the person on the lotus had already charged over. When they charged over, a pair of golden wings unfolded behind them with dragon runes gathered in their palm, it was Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Grasp!

As for that person, it was naturally Lin Yun!
