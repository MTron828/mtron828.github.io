As the crimson bolts of lightning descended from the sky, Lin Yun’s physique was nearly torn apart. At this moment, he was facing a crisis from the outside and within his body.

Without the dragon runes protecting him, Lin Yun’s physique was extremely weak. His condition was so bad that he looked like a broken statue.

Am I about to die? Lin Yun’s heart sank as many scenes flashed in his mind. He even thought about giving up. If he gave up now, he might be able to get away. However, just as soon as these thoughts entered his mind, they disappeared.

“Why would I be afraid of death? I’m a swordsman! I’m never going to give up!” Lin Yun’s heart blazed violently as a golden seal started to devour the surrounding astral energy.

“Divine Sun Breaking Seal!” Lin Yun roared. He was betting that his Divine Sun Breaking Seal could make a breakthrough to greater mastery before he was torn apart by the lightning.

At this point, his last hopes were on the Divine Sun Breaking Seal. If he couldn’t resist the lightning, he would die a miserable death.

An ordinary person would never act so daring. After all, failing the tribulation was better than getting killed by the tribulation. However, the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm was never this dangerous. In fact, it would start getting dangerous after the third tribulation. As long as one had enough resources, the first tribulation was a breeze.

Lin Yun wasn’t like normal cultivators though. Instead, he chose an insane route to attempt a breakthrough in his Divine Sun Breaking Fist. Even with cracks spreading out on his body, Lin Yun chose to take a risk.

All of a sudden, the golden seal on Lin Yun’s hand underwent a transformation.

“Break!” Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered to examine the changes on the seal as he threw a punch.

A boom sounded out from the clash as Lin Yun was forced to sit on the ground. His body was still collapsing and he would die if he took too much time messing around. Fortunately, he executed the Divine Sun Breaking Seal and essentially drained some of the astral energy that was harming his body.

New astral energy poured into his new aura ocean and became solidified. When the aura ocean completely stabilized, it started to expand in size. Simultaneously, his body was starting to recover and becoming stronger than before.

Lin Yun was stuck in this state for three days until all the divine astral pellets in the valley exploded. At this moment, they were completely drained and gave birth to the complete version of Lin Yun’s new aura ocean.

At the same time, the azure dragon, Divine Sun Breaking Seal, and crimson lightning rained down on Lin Yun in a light shower. It was like a baptism of power for Lin Yun. Then, Lin Yun opened his eyes.

Raising his hand, he made a fist and his bones crackled like lightning. The current him was a lot stronger than the past. Wanting to test his strength, Lin Yun stood up and threw a punch.

The space in front of Lin Yun boomed like a meteorite hitting the earth. With just his physique, he had enough power to easily injure a second soul Heavenly Soul Realm genius that wasn’t on the Azure Dragon Ranking.

As Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts, he circulated both of his aura oceans and felt origin energy filling every corner of his body. The aura was so powerful that he couldn’t imagine what would happen if he tried a serious attack.

With a single thought, the light from Lin Yun’s fist quietly disappeared.

Lin Yun smiled as he could finally control his power the way he wanted. Initially, he was worried that he wouldn’t be able to control his power after reaching the first soul. Due to the astronomical amount of divine astral pellets, there was no telling what would happen. After all, if he couldn’t control his power, he would get injured.

Lin Yun might seem impulsive, but his thoughts were meticulous. He knew that his physique couldn’t stay injured for too long. Even if he could bear the pain with his recovery ability, it would increase the damage on his body in the long run. At that time, even a celestial wouldn’t live for more than a year.

“Very good.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed because he wasn’t only thinking about the Bloodbone Realm. He wanted to be the center of attention when the realms competed. His goal was to show off his elegance that was birthed from the Profound Amber Realm’s Sword Firmament Pavilion.

“Well, it looks like the Divine Sun Breaking Seal reached greater mastery. I should try it out.” Lin Yun opened his hand and an ancient seal appeared. The seal looked a lot more refined than before. It looked like an ancient word or a divine rune.

Most importantly, Lin Yun could summon the seal without having to circulate his origin energy.

Lin Yun started circulating the origin energy in his two aura oceans and poured them into the seal. In the blink of an eye, the Divine Sun Breaking Seal had reached the level of lesser mastery and continued to surge. At the same time, the image of a winged human appeared behind Lin Yun that filled the valley with blazing brilliance.

Then, Lin Yun punched the ground. The ground exploded as cracks spread out everywhere. The attacks were so strong that the mountains surrounding the valley were destroyed.

Just when the mountains were about to bury Lin Yun, he unleashed his sword intent and manifested an azure dragon that carried him into the sky.

Lin Yun paused because his spiritual sword intent had reached a bottleneck. He could sense that the spiritual sword intent was practically perfect.

In fact, the outline of the azure dragon also contained a wisp of thunderstorm aura with every single strand of sword aura that it was created with. This meant that Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent had reached the limit and no one was capable of surpassing him.

If someone looked from afar, they would think that the azure dragon was a genuine dragon and not the manifestation of someone’s sword intent.

“Not bad.” Lin Yun was satisfied with the improvements of his sword intent. As long as he could comprehend the sky sword intent, he would shake the entire Heavenly Path. But he knew that it wouldn’t be easy because he had to go through life and death to obtain his xiantian sword intent.

Although it wasn’t as dangerous for him to comprehend the spiritual sword intent, it still took a great deal of his effort and luck. If he didn’t have any opportunities, then he couldn’t make a breakthrough.

At this moment, Lil’ Red flew over and was shocked to see the aftermath of Lin Yun’s tribulation. It was even more shocked by Lin Yun’s current strength. When Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Red’s expression, he revealed a smile.

Before he underwent the tribulation, he wasn’t much stronger than Lil’ Red, which didn’t feel good. But now, he was much stronger than Lil’ Red. If he didn’t have enough power, who knows if Lil’ Rd would go insane and steal from him.

“Lil’ Red, let’s go. I bet those people are starting to feel annoyed,” smiled Lin Yun.

Although he didn’t receive any information when he underwent his tribulation, he could easily guess that he caused huge waves. After all, one man challenging an entire realm was unprecedented. There were probably many people who were waiting to see him die.

“Sorry, but I’m afraid you guys will be disappointed. The Bloodbone Realm wants my life? Fat chance!” Lin Yun smiled as he gazed into the distance with fighting spirits blazing in his pupils.
