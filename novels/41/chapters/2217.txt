Chapter 2218: Devilish Training Regimen

“Do you want to know?” Mu Xueling looked at Lin Yun calmly.

“Yeah,” Lin Yun replied. He had long been curious about the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain.

“Come with me, then,” Mu Xueling said without any hesitation.

“To the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain?” Lin Yun looked at Mu Xueling with surprise, and he noticed that she wasn’t joking. He asked, “Can the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain ensure that my master will make it through his tribulation?”

“Lin Yun, watch your tone. The Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain doesn’t owe you anything. If you look at it, you’re the one who will owe the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain instead. I’m willing to bring you over because of a promise to ensure your safety. Your disclosed identity will bring you danger, which is why I made that decision. It’s not the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain that needs you,” Mu Xueling said indifferently.

Lin Yun was stunned when he replied, “Sorry about that.”

Thinking about it again, what he did earlier was a little too much, treating Mu Xueling and Yue Weiwei as one. In reality, they were one when Yue Weiwei was together. Then again, he didn’t have much of a relationship with Mu Xueling, and Mu Xueling only helped him multiple times because of Yue Weiwei. He sincerely apologized, “I’m sorry for what I said.”

Seeing this, Mu Xueling no longer reprimanded Lin Yun, but she said, “The Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain is special and cannot interfere with the outside world, even if Yue Weiwei becomes the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Maiden in the future. So it’s already tough on her to try and protect you, not to mention the divine mountain rarely welcomes outsiders.”

“I know. I’m grateful for the Saint Elder’s kindness, and I recklessly blurted that out earlier,” Lin Yun smiled.

Mu Xueling’s tone softened as she said, “The matter with your master is complicated. Even your master’s origin isn’t as simple as you think.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun was surprised. He asked, “You’re talking about the Jian Clan?”

“It looks like the Radiant Sword Saint told you some of it.” Mu Xueling said, “The Jian Clan is one of the Eight Ancient Imperial Clans, but the Radiant Sword Saint broke the rule. This is why he’s unable to receive the Jian Clan’s help. But I don’t know the entire story.”

Lin Yun nodded but no longer asked anything else.

“What do you plan to do next?” Mu Xueling asked. She no longer forced it now that Lin Yun wouldn’t be willing to accompany her.

“I will wait for my senior brother,” Lin Yun smiled. He was looking forward to the training regimen his senior brother had prepared for him.

“For what?” Mu Xueling asked.

“That’s a secret!” Lin Yun wore a mysterious smile. He had a closer relationship with his senior brother than Mu Xueling, so he kept it a secret. Then again, there were also some elements of anger. Since the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain wouldn’t help him, he wouldn’t need their help. Either way, he wasn’t alone.

“You seem to be pretty confident?” Mu Xueling was smart, instantly understanding Lin Yun’s intentions.

“That’s for sure. After all, he’s my senior brother,” Lin Yun replied with a brow raise.

Mu Xueling no longer asked about it and began walking around the courtyard with Lin Yun behind her, casually chatting with her.

“Saint Elder, what do you think of my place?” Lin Yun smiled.

“So-so, but I’m not picky, so I’m fine with it,” Mu Xueling replied.

Lin Yun could sense that something wasn’t right with Mu Xueling’s tone, so he asked, “Saint Elder, you’re not going to leave?”

“I will stay here for some time,” Mu Xueling nodded.

Lin Yun opened his mouth and was dumbfounded. He didn’t realize that he had such good luck with women.

“What are you thinking about? Your identity has been disclosed, so I will do my best to protect you before you reach the Saint Realm,” Mu Xueling said furiously as she noticed Lin Yun’s thoughts.

“Oh, okay.” Lin Yun smiled and said nothing else.

The next morning, Ye Guhan came over while smiling, “Junior Brother, are you prepared?’

“I have been waiting.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with anticipation.

“Mhm? The Saint Elder is also here?” Ye Guhan was surprised and transmitted his voice into Mu Xueling’s ears. After he was done, he smiled, “Saint Elder, what do you think? Are you interested in participating?”

Hearing Ye Guhan’s plan, Mu Xueling sent a deep look at Lin Yun, and said, “Sure.”

“Hahaha! Great!” Ye Guhan laughed.

“Senior Brother, are we on the same topic?” Lin Yun asked carefully, noticing that something wasn’t right. Why was Mu Xueling also involved?

“That’s for sure!” Ye Guhan patted Lin Yun’s shoulder and smiled, “Hehe. You’re really lucky, and you now have five times the happiness instead of four.”

Lin Yun did not know what was happening, but he followed Ye Guhan and Mu Xueling. They entered the depths of the Heavenly Dao Sect and soon arrived in an eerie valley. It was clearly daytime, but there wasn’t a gleam of light in the valley because the mountains were enveloped in crimson clouds.

“What is this place?” Lin Yun asked with a frown. He could sense a horrifying aura in the mountain range up ahead.

“Blood Purgatory Mountain,” Ye Guhan said as he chewed on a fruit.

Lin Yun muttered, “Why does it sound familiar?”

Mu Xueling took a glance at it, and said, “Back then, an Emperor barged into the Heavenly Dao Sect and died here. His blood dyed the valley red, becoming a forbidden ground within the Heavenly Dao Sect.”

Lin Yun squinted as he recalled it now. This was a forbidden ground of the Heavenly Dao Sect. He once heard other disciples mentioning it before. He wasn’t afraid but could feel that something wasn’t right. He asked, “Senior Brother, does it have to be in Blood Purgatory Mountain?”

“What’s wrong? You’re afraid?” Ye Guhan smiled. “This was personally chosen for you, and it has to be here if you want to face Saints. Let’s go, they’re already waiting.”

When they came to the foot of the mountain, the Serene Dust Great Saint, Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and Dragon Origin Great Saint were already waiting there.

“Mistresses. Master.” Lin Yun cupped his fists together.

“Haha! That’s enough. Lin Yun, Ye Guhan has told us about your matters, but have you thought it through? It’s not too late to regret it now,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint smiled.

Ye Guhan interrupted, “It’s already too late to regret it.”

“I won’t regret it. So what if it’s Blood Purgatory Mountain? There’s nothing special about it,” Lin Yun replied. After becoming familiar with this place, he noticed that it wasn’t as dangerous as he had imagined, mainly because he was confident in his sword intent.

“As expected of my beloved junior brother. Let’s first start with the first peak to temper his physique. Get your master, the Dragon Origin Great Saint, to bring you there,” Ye Guhan smiled.

Lin Yun instantly understood that these people wanted to train him from multiple aspects, which sounded pretty good. After all, four Great Saints and the Saint Elder of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain were going to train him. Not even a holy son could receive such treatment.

“Hold on.” Ye Guhan called out to Lin Yun, and smiled, “Since you’re going to temper your physique, you have to be focused. So I will have to seal your saint aura.”

Before Lin Yun could respond, Ye Guhan moved and his sword aura formed into shackles that tied up Lin Yun’s violet palace. Lin Yun instantly realized that he couldn’t circulate his saint aura any longer, including the two sword canons. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled, “Sure.”

“Your sword intent as well,” Ye Guhan smiled.

Lin Yun’s face changed, and Ye Guhan’s finger fell onto his forehead before he could respond. Compared to how Ye Guhan easily sealed Lin Yun’s saint aura, he was having a tougher time and couldn’t instantly seal it.

“Not bad! Not bad!” Ye Guhan smiled as he circulated the Great Profound Sword Canon. Seven swords appeared, and his sword aura formed into shackles that wrapped around Lin Yun’s sword sea.

This surprised the other Great Saints and Mu Xueling. This meant that Lin Yun’s sword intent was so powerful that even Ye Guhan had difficulty sealing it when Lin Yun wasn’t resisting. If Lin Yun resisted, Ye Guhan might not have been able to seal his sword intent.

Lin Yun gave it an attempt and noticed that his sword intent and saint aura were sealed. He could only mobilize his vitality now. He bitterly smiled, “Senior Brother, isn’t this too ruthless?”

“You made this choice. So go on, stop wasting time,” Ye Guhan smiled.

Lin Yun said nothing as he nodded at everyone before catching up with the Dragon Origin Great Saint, who was already climbing the mountain. When his foot fell onto the steps, he heard an explosion as a gale flew on his face like blades.

“What powerful murderous intent!” Lin Yun raised his head to look at the Dragon Origin Great Saint before he followed behind him, taking a deep breath. He immediately felt a great pressure when both of his feet fell onto the steps.

Lin Yun’s heart was beating violently as he released the Azure Dragon Divine Physique to resist the pressure. But as he climbed the mountain, the pressure began to increase, and he soon lost sight of the Dragon Origin Great Saint. His forehead was sweaty, and he was gasping for breath, “Why is it so tiring?”

Lin Yun was already reaching his limit after just a few minutes before he could even reach halfway up the mountain. Logically speaking, even if his sword intent and saint aura were sealed, his physique was the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, which shouldn’t be that weak.

Taking a deep breath, he wanted to resist the pressure with his sword aura by instinct, but he discovered that his sword intent was restrained. Shaking his head, he circulated the Azure Dragon Divine Physique with a dragon’s roar echoing from his body and his blood began to boil. A golden halo shone on him, and a dragon coiled around him.

After completely activating the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, Lin Yun finally increased his speed and easily crossed a hundred meters whenever he moved. When he reached halfway up the mountain, he saw the meditating Dragon Origin Great Saint and said, “Master.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint opened his eyes and said, “The Blood Purgatory Emperor’s corpse is buried beneath Blood Purgatory Mountain. The gravity here is five times greater than in the outside world. But with the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, it shouldn’t be that hard to come here. Now, completely circulate the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. The gravity at the top of the mountain is ten times greater, so you have to climb back up again.”

Before Lin Yun could speak, the Dragon Origin Great Saint punched Lin Yun in his chest and Lin Yun rolled down the mountain. When Lin Yun stopped, he was back where he started, with his body covered in wounds.

“A little harsh, but this is what makes it interesting.” Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips with a cold smile. He didn’t complain as he gritted his teeth and climbed the mountain again.
