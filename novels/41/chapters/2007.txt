Chapter 2008 - Blood Crow Ancestor

When the Silver Gale King returned with the second brother, it was discovered that the third brother was also missing, naturally making him anxious. Thus, it could only leave the second brother behind and return. It was sure that Lin Yun was going after the Battlement Shift King this time.

But when it returned, it saw the Battlement Shift King curiously looking over. The Battlement Shift King asked, “Silver Gale King, where’s the second, third, and fourth brother?”

“You haven’t seen them?” The Silver Gale King exclaimed.

“No. Haven’t they been with you? They must be in trouble! I’ll go with you this time.” The Battle Shift King could sense that something wasn’t right.

“You can’t. We can’t afford to lose our home, and someone has to be here,” the Silver Gale King said.

“I’ll go this time,” the Battle Shift King suggested.

“No, you have to deal with it using intelligence. This is a series of traps.” The Silver Gale King didn’t want to explain much, and he could only blame it on the demon for being too cunning. Thus, it could only return in a hurry. But this time, it never came back.

Fifteen minutes later, a bright sun appeared on the horizon as Lin Yun returned.

The Battle Shift King opened its eyes and asked in shock, “Where are my four brothers?”

“Long gone.” Lin Yun smiled, then he dashed forth. He would be in trouble if he faced all five Blood Crow Kings at once, but dealing with them one at a time wasn’t an issue. The Blood Crow Kings might be strong, but they weren’t intelligent.

Lin Yun didn’t take long to kill the last remaining Blood Crow King, and the surrounding Blood Crows fled for their lives. While Lin Yun stowed the Golden Crow Wings back into his body, he killed a few thousand-year Blood Crows before leaping onto the altar.

An entirely different scene appeared before him, and crimson runes formed into an array before him. The array nodes were all beads containing sins, there were hundreds of those beads, at least. At the core of the array, there was even a golden bead.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun knew that this must be the Yin-Yang Bloodlust Array. Ten-odd elite Blood Crows were guarding this place, and they charged over the moment they saw Lin Yun.

Lin Yun didn’t go easy on them, releasing his Azure Dragon Sword Heart, Astral Sword Intent, the glory spirits in the Flower Burial Sword, and the nirvana aura within his body. His Astral Sword Intent tore apart the clouds, with the Azure Dragon Sword Heart releasing a dazzling silver radiance. He didn’t hold back and slaughtered all the elite Blood Crows before waving his hand and stowing all of the beads.

“How heavy!” Lin Yun could feel the density of the golden bead when he held onto it. But he soon smiled because he knew he had obtained a treasure.

When he took a sniff, his brows locked together because he could sense dense death energy. The Myriad Graves Valley might be filled with graves, but the valley was brimming with vitality, giving birth to countless demonic beasts. Not to mention there were all sorts of rare flowers containing baleful energy, demonic energy, spiritual energy, and even saint energy. But there wasn’t any death energy because lifeforce would soon assimilate them.

“Where did the death energy come from?” Lin Yun sheathed his sword and followed the direction of the death energy. The more he walked, the darker the surroundings became until he couldn’t see his fingers. He could only rely on the Divine Dragon Eyes to barely see the surroundings, and the death energy within the surroundings was also dense.

An hour later, Lin Yun stopped and saw dim lights ahead of him. He came to a small hill that gave off a weak crimson radiance, and he couldn’t help taking a deep breath when he saw the scenery before him. This place was covered with bones; he couldn’t help wondering how many people have died here.

Although he had killed many people as a swordsman, this scene before him shocked him, and the death energy didn’t come from the bones. The bones here dated from half a month to a thousand years ago.

“Over there!” Lin Yun raised his head and locked onto the source of the death energy, spotting a small hill at the far end of his vision.

This place was weird, and he could smell the evil in the air. Even with the Divine Dragon Eyes, he was having difficulty seeing, but the Azure Dragon Sword Heart warned him of the dangers. It warned him that the danger was greater than the five Blood Crow Kings.

Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to head over. Even if it were not for the Udumbara Flower, he had to take a look for all the human cultivators who have died here. He could finally see it clearly when he flew in the air and got a thousand meters close to the hill. It wasn’t a mountain, but a huge grave!

A figure was seated on the grave, and a layer of blood bones enveloped that figure. On the surface of the blood bones, there were golden runes with a baleful aura being emitted from them. Despite having a humanoid figure, Lin Yun could sense the aura of a Blood Crow. This person should be the Blood Crow Ancestor!

Suddenly, Lin Yun opened his mouth with disbelief because the Blood Crow Ancestor gave off strands of azure saint aura. The Blood Crow Ancestor had stepped onto the saint path, but this wasn’t what shocked Lin Yun the most.

The Blood Crow Ancestor opened its eyes, looking at Lin Yun with its golden pupils. “I’m surprised that you’re here so quickly. You must be the demon the livestock outside have been mentioning, right? To have such strength at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage, you must be a saint disciple, right? Which holy land did you come from?”

Surprisingly, the Blood Crow Ancestor seemed to know about the outside world, and it managed to see through Lin Yun’s origin with a glance. The Blood Crow Ancestor seemed different from the other Blood Crows.

“Hehe, you seem surprised?” The Blood Crow Ancestor asked in a playful tone.

“You’re actually using graves to cultivate. You’re really not afraid of death!” Lin Yun said. In terms of danger, the Myriad Graves Valley was bizarre and insignificant in the God Burial Mountain Range. So many cultivators would train themselves here, and their lives wouldn’t be in danger if they didn’t go deep into the Myriad Graves Valley.

But there was a taboo in the Myriad Graves Valley, that was to touch the graves here. Anyone who touched the graves would die, and they might even face something worse than death.

The Blood Crow Ancestor said in disdain, “If I don’t touch the graves, how will I step into the saint path? Do you want me to remain as a Blood Crow for the rest of my life? Those who couldn’t step onto the path of a saint are ants!”

“You killed these people?” Lin Yun already intended to retreat because he sensed that the Blood Crow Ancestor was horrifying.

“Haha, that’s for sure. I have to eat a human every month, which is the best delicacy. I’ll eat later as well!” The Blood Crow Ancestor looked down at Lin Yun with disdain, but he wasn’t hurrying to kill him.

“Have you seen the Udumbara Flower?” Lin Yun asked.

A cunning light flashed across the pupils of the Blood Crow Ancestor, and it smiled, “I’ve stayed here for over ten thousand years, and I’ve naturally seen it before. If you can provide something more tempting than your flesh, I don’t mind giving you some clues.”

The Blood Crow Ancestor was trying to probe if Lin Yun had companions. After all, it had seen countless betrayals throughout its long lifespan.

“Is a Natal Yin Saint Physique enough?” Lin Yun asked.

Crimson flames blazed within the Blood Crow Ancestor’s pupils. It suppressed its excitement and said, “If what you say is true, it’s naturally enough.”

“Come with me, then,” Lin Yun said.

“Hehe. You bring him here,” the Blood Crow Ancestor licked its lips.

“How can I trust you?” Lin Yun asked.

“You don’t have to worry about that. Even if I tell you where the Udumbara Flower is, you can’t obtain it. But I can give you other benefits. The Udumbara Flower has a lot of secrets,” the Blood Crow Ancestor smiled.

“Okay, I’ll be right back.” Lin Yun briefly hesitated, before appearing to have believed the Blood Crow Ancestor. When he turned around, a crimson figure appeared behind him without any signs.

The Blood Crow Ancestor appeared behind Lin Yun with its sharp claws reaching forth. This attack was fast and ruthless; one could see how vicious the Blood Crow Ancestor was. But the Blood Crow Ancestor didn’t notice that Lin Yun was holding onto an umbrella when he turned around. It was the Sovereign Saint Artifact, the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella!
