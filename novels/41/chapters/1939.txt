Chapter 1940 - Contribution Hall

When Wang Yue raised his head, he noticed Lin Yun was already far away. He quickly caught up with Lin Yun and asked with some hesitation, “Are you sure it’s really called Light of the Beginning?”

“Not confirmed,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Then why did you tell me it’s Light of the Beginning? Ye Qingtian, I’m not asking you to teach me, I only want to know the name of it,” Wang Yue said unhappily.

“The Contribution Hall…” Lin Yun muttered, looking at the plaque on the hall.

“Ye Qingtian, do you need to hide it from me?” Wang Yue said, seeing that Lin Yun had ignored him.

Lin Yun turned around and smiled, “I can’t tell you about it. But I don’t mind teaching it to you.”

Wang Yue was inwardly shocked after hearing what Lin Yun said, and he asked, “Are you serious about that? That is at least a dragon spirit martial technique. You’re willing to teach it to me? You must’ve gotten it from your master, the Dragon Origin Great Saint. So can you make decisions about it?”

Many martial techniques were kept secret from others, and some even had to swear an oath before learning them. In Wang Yue’s view, such a powerful sword technique must have been given to Ye Qingtian by the Dragon Origin Great Saint or the Ye Clan. Regardless of which, it wasn’t something that could be taught to others.

Lin Yun saw Wang Yue’s expression and knew the latter wouldn’t believe him even if he said he had created it. He briefly pondered before saying, “You don’t need to care about that for now. If you’re willing to tell me the secrets of your Life Intent, I’m naturally willing to share my secret with you as well.”

Sword of the Beginning was something that he created, containing all of his experiences. So even if he told Wang Yue how to execute it, it would be hard for Wang Yue to truly grasp it. So it wouldn’t harm him if he shared it with Wang Yue.

Furthermore, Lin Yun wouldn’t be bothered even if Wang Yue really did manage to learn it. This was because he was confident in his talent, and they could also share their insights on it if Wang Yue managed to master it. Then again, there was a prerequisite to learning it, and one had to be a swordsman with a true love for the sword, like how he taught the Carefree 9 Swords to Zhao Yan.

As for Wang Yue, Lin Yun acknowledged his talent in sword dao, even if he didn’t interact with him much.

“Are you serious about that?” Wang Yue asked. He wouldn’t lose anything even if he told Ye Qingtian the secrets of his Life Intent. Even if Ye Qingtian knew about it, he couldn't master it. If it could be so easily mastered, Life Intent wouldn’t be so rare. This had nothing to do with one’s talent in sword dao.

“Take your time to consider it,” Lin Yun smiled as they entered the Contribution Hall. The Contribution Hall was enveloped in a faint saint radiance, and shelves were placed there. All sorts of precious treasures were on the shelves, such as saint pellets, secret treasures, weapons, jade slips, demonic beast materials, saint liquids, and even rare metals.

Beneath each item was a number stating the required contribution points to exchange for them.

The Saint Realm section of the Divine Sunchasing Art, True Dragon Liquid, and the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s contribution points… Lin Yun inwardly muttered, already knowing what he wanted before coming here.

He couldn’t afford to miss the Divine Sunchasing Art since it could be found here, and next would be the True Dragon Saint Liquid and inheriting the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s treasures. Those were treasures that the Dragon Origin Great Saint left behind before he became a Saint Elder. After he became a Saint Elder, many things became useless to him, so they were left in the Contribution Hall.

Not only the Dragon Origin Great Saint, but that was also the case for the other Saint Elders.

“Gentlemen, are you guys here to exchange your contribution points?” A deacon walked over.

Lin Yun was surprised upon seeing this person because this deacon was at the Quasi-Saint Realm, but he soon figured it out after noticing the golden threads on the deacon’s sleeves. The threads meant that this person was part of the Golden Guards, who were saint disciples after exceeding a hundred years old. Only those who reached the Quasi-Saint Realm could become a Golden Guard, and they were the intermediate forces of the Heavenly Dao Sect, responsible for guarding the entire sect.

Their authority involved upholding the sect’s regulations, capturing traitors, hunting demonic cultivators, and ensuring the safety of the Heavenly Dao Sect’s territory. Simply put, they could be considered an elite troop of the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Gentlemen, my name is Bai Xiao, a Golden Deacon of the Contribution Hall,” said the grey-clothed man smiled, looking at Lin Yun and Wang Yue. But the majority of his attention was on Lin Yun. He naturally recognized Ye Qingtian and knew that Ye Qingtian had become an influential figure within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Deacon Bai, you’re too polite. We’re only here to exchange for some stuff, and we can’t have the honor of a Golden Guard personally serving us,” Wang Yue said politely.

But Bai Xiao merely smiled and looked at Lin Yun with an amicable expression. He said, “You guys are naturally worthy. Everyone within the Heavenly Dao Sect has been talking about Junior Brother Ye’s sword back in the Ranking Battle, and I’m also curious about it. Many people within the Contribution Hall are also curious about it. Just look around you.”

When Wang Yue looked around, he noticed the surrounding gazes were on Ye Qingtian. This was because Ye Qingtian’s transformation over the past year was too great, and Wang Yue couldn’t help but sigh as he examined Ye Qingtian. He now knew why his cousin would look at Ye Qingtian differently now.

“I need the Divine Sunchasing Art and True Dragon Saint Liquid,” Lin Yun said.

Bai Xiao was briefly stunned. He wasn’t surprised that Ye Qingtian wanted True Dragon Saint Liquid, but he was curious as to why Ye Qingtian wanted the Divine Sunchasing Art. This movement technique was complicated, and learning it was painful, requiring many resources to practice it.

“Come with me.” Bai Xiao led Lin Yun away, with Wang Yue following behind after a brief hesitation.

As they passed several checkpoints, Bai Xiao led Lin Yun and Wang Yue to a secluded chamber. Before them was a man-made saint lake with a huge cauldron beneath the lake.

“Mhm?” Lin Yun exclaimed in surprise.

“Does it look familiar?” Bai Xiao asked.

“Yeah. I’ve seen a similar cauldron in the Heavenly Astral Pavilion, and the environment is also similar.” Lin Yun nodded his head.

“We bought the True Dragon Saint Liquid from them. We also provide the corpses of demonic beasts possessing the Dragon Clan’s bloodline. They need our protection, so we can get it cheap,” Bai Xiao smiled.

Lin Yun was speechless when he heard that. The Heavenly Dao Sect was rich enough to buy True Dragon Saint Liquid in the measurement scale of cauldrons. This wasn’t something other forces could afford because they might not be able to provide that many demonic beasts that possess the Dragon Clan’s bloodline.

This was also Wang Yue’s first time coming here, so he was also shocked.

“How much do you need?” Bai Xiao asked.

Lin Yun stared at the lake and replied, “Let’s start with a cauldron.”

Bai Xiao was stumped upon hearing that before he smiled, “Junior Brother, you must be joking. A cauldron is equivalent to sixty thousand kilograms, requiring a hundred years to refine it. The Contribution Hall only has ten cauldrons in stock. We have a spiritual array at the bottom of the lake. The array uses the True Dragon Saint Liquid, and the lake has 70% of the True Dragon Saint Liquid’s effects.”

Bai Xiao called a person over and gave Lin Yun a cup.

As Lin Yun took a small sip of the cup, he could sense his vitality greedily devouring the liquid, and he was shocked as he looked at the saint lake. If he used it to practice his body-refining technique, the saint liquid in the lake would suffice.

“Most people would usually exchange for the saint liquid in the lake rather than the True Dragon Saint Liquid because it’s more cost-effective,” Bai Xiao smiled.

“How much True Dragon Saint Liquid can I exchange with five hundred thousand contribution points? I’m talking about those in the cauldron,” Lin Yun asked.

“Roughly two thousand kilograms,” Bai Xiao replied. It was much less than Lin Yun had imagined.

“Too little.” Lin Yun furrowed his brows. According to Lil’ Purple, he needed at least sixty thousand kilograms for the Phoenix Tree to grow.

‘You can take a look.” Bai Xiao didn’t explain and gave an eye signal to the left and right. As the spiritual array in the lake circulated, a huge cauldron rose from the lake.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

When the cauldron appeared, it was accompanied by a dragon roar, along with a terrifying dragon aura that spread out.
