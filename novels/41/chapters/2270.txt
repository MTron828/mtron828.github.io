Chapter 2271 - Are You Afraid?

Li Feibai was in a pathetic state, with injuries covering her whole body. Her injuries had heavenly flames on them, which instilled stinging pain in her. The Sovereign Constellation might have been restrained, but the lotus still bloomed and was revolving beneath her.

“Sorry about this!” Liu Yunlan’s eyes flashed with a chill as galaxies appeared around him. He had finally brought out his Astral Blade Intent, sending Li Feibai flying away.

When Li Feibai landed on the ground, blood was dripping down her lips as the blade easily tore apart the flame dragon that was around her. She wiped the blood off her lips and said, “I shouldn’t have promised him if I knew this would happen.”

Despite what she said, she soared back to the sky after she got up from the ground. The lotus beneath her feet bloomed with a shining golden radiance while she clasped her hands together. With a dragon’s roar echoing about, she shone as brightly as a bright sun, with hundreds of flame dragons soaring out from behind her, chasing Liu Yunlan.

Liu Yunlan held onto his blade and swung it, controlling the galaxies to flutter like a ribbon. His blade was fast, slaughtering all of the flame dragons. But some of them forced Liu Yunlan to take ten-odd steps back.

“What’s that fellow doing?” Huang Jingyu’s face was ugly while joining hands with the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord to suppress Li Feibai’s Sovereign Constellation. He could tell that Liu Yunlan was holding back in this fight.

As Li Feibai descended from the sky, she wanted to force Liu Yunlan further away. She could sense that the phoenix aura within Ji Zixi’s body was slowly becoming violent, indicating that Lin Yun had reached a critical moment.

“Out of the way!” As Li Feibai and Liu Yunlan clashed, Huang Jingyu charged over with his face becoming sinister. He had lost his patience and sent Liu Yunlan away. He roared, “You suppress the Sovereign Constellation. I’ll deal with her!”

Huang Jingyu had become a fourth-stage Saint Lord. The aura he gave off was powerful and sent Li Feibai flying away, as well as sending Liu Yunlan away.

“Lady Li, you’re a descendant of an Imperial Clan, and I don’t wish to become enemies with you. But I have lost my patience with you after have interfered in my affairs time and time again!” Huang Jingyu snorted as he activated the Sacred Moonlight Ring. A silver moonlight shone from him the next moment, forming into a domain. When the domain was formed, Huang Jingyu's aura became even more terrifying, placing Li Feibai in a terrible position.

“Sorry about this!” Not giving Li Feibai a chance to react, Huang Jingyu threw his punch, forcing Li Feibai to take a few steps back.

As blood dripped down Li Feibai’s lips, she coughed and flicked her finger, seeing that Huang Jingyu was charging over. The flame dragon around her flew out, and the high temperature from the dragon caused the surrounding air to distort, with black holes forming.

“You are really getting on my nerves!” Huang Jingyu’s face was dark as he manifested a giant palm to grab onto the Flame Dragon’s neck. The flame dragon wailed out as it died in the domain.

“That’s enough!” Huang Jingyu’s eyes were filled with ferocity as he dashed forth with a sun and a moon appearing in the domain. As the sun and moon revolved, the saint aura that Huang Jingyu gave off became even more terrifying. Paired with his cultivation as a fourth-stage Saint Lord, he immediately restrained Li Feibai.

Compared to Liu Yunlan, Huang Jingyu was more violent since he didn’t hold back in his palms. Each of his attacks would cause the ground to violently tremble, making Li Feibai feel like her body was about to collapse.

“You interfered during the Divine Blood Fruit and now want to interfere with the divine flame fragment! Are you done?! Why are you helping him?!” Huang Jingyu’s hair fluttered as the effects of the Blood Flame Pill were fully unleashed, making him look like a demonic cultivator.

“Are you done? You’re like a sissy, which I hate about you. What can you do to me if I want to help him? Kill me if you have the guts!” Li Feibai firmly planted her feet on the ground just when she was about to enter within a hundred meters of Lin Yun’s radius. She gritted her teeth with her face covered in blood, looking heroic.

“What can you do to me if I don’t want to help you?!” Li Feibai threw out a mouthful of blood as the lotus beneath her feet became dim once more.

Huang Jingyu’s face became dark as he circulated the Sun-Moon Saint Canon and appeared before Li Feibai. When he threw his palms forth, the sun and moon revolved beneath his feet as various phenomena appeared in the domain, such as the sun's rising and setting. This was the secret technique of the Sun-Moon Saint Canon, the Myriad Manifestation Palm!

Each strike was like the reenactment of heaven and earth. This was a terrifying secret technique that only the sect master’s lineage in the Ming Cult could practice.

Li Feibai could initially still hold her ground, but she soon lost. After thirty-odd movies, the lotus beneath Li Feibai shattered.

“She’s really heavily injured this time…” The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord could sense that the power of the Sovereign Constellation was declining when the lotus shattered.

Lin Yun’s heart jumped as he couldn’t help being distracted. When he raised his head, his face sank.

“Is that the best you can do?!” Li Feibai stood firmly with her arms crossed together, mocking Huang Jingyu.

“Ha!” Huang Jingyu smiled eerily, “You don’t have to provoke me. You’re a disciple of the Eight Imperial Clans, so I won’t kill you. But I will teach you some rules that even the disciples of the Eight Imperial Clans have to lower their heads!

“Heavenly Kui!” As a sinister expression appeared on Huang Jingyu’s face, he raised his head, “Hold her down! I’ll teach her a lesson!”

Compared to Liu Yunlan, the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord was more cold-blooded. He brandished the Golden Thunder Flag in his hand and two chains flew over, piercing Li Feibai in the back then pinning her to the ground. The pain made Li Feibai scream out, with her face becoming distorted.

“Woman, this is the rule. When you’re outside, don’t mess around with fire because there are some people that you can’t afford to provoke even if you’re a disciple of the Eight Imperial Clans,” Huang Jingyu said sinisterly.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Ha, you really know how to put on a pretence,” Li Feibai smiled.

“So what?” Huang Jingyu laughed, wanting to grab Li Feibai’s hair to teach her a lesson. But right then, a golden flaming pillar soared into the sky, making Huang Jingyu squint. When he raised his head, he saw that Ji Zixi was enveloped by the golden flames, giving off a sacred and ancient aura.

“Where’s Lin Yun?” Huang Jingyu was inwardly alarmed because Lin Yun had disappeared. He didn’t hesitate to stomp on the ground and retreat. But it was too late, a sword ray had flown over. Even if Huang Jingyu tried his best to dodge, he was still left with a sword wound on the right side of his face.

The sword ray was accompanied by a boundless sword aura that felt like a slap, sending him flying away.

When Huang Jingyu stabilized himself, he fell onto the ground with one knee, and his face became sinister when he raised his head. He laughed, “Flower Burial, you’re finally going to make a move.”

Lin Yun didn’t even look at Huang Jingyu as he turned to the Lightning Chains that had pinned Li Feibai to the ground. Raising his head to the sky, he saw that the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord was holding onto the Golden Thunder Flag and even gave him a provocative smile.

But the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord’s smile froze on his face when he saw Lin Yun using his hand to shatter the Lightning Chains. He was a second-stage Saint Lord and was confident that even the Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent couldn’t shatter his Lightning Chains. And yet Lin Yun had easily accomplished this without even drawing his sword.

But he was even more shocked when he saw Lin Yun grabbing onto two chains and giving them a tug. Before the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord could respond, the surrounding space trembled and he was dragged over. Everything had taken place in the blink of an eye.

“Don’t be careless. He’s a second-stage Saint Lord with a Glory Saint Artifact…” Li Feibai said as she coughed.

“Second-stage Saint Lord? That’s nothing before me,” Lin Yun said as Black Thunder Chains flew out, coiling around the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord before the latter could respond and wrapped around his neck.

This immediately made the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord feel suffocating as he grabbed onto his face.

“Stop!” Huang Jingyu roared with his face changing. He was anxious since the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord had a high position in the Myriad Lightning Sect. How could he not be anxious when he saw Lin Yun choking him?

“Too late,” Lin Yun said as the Black Thunder Chains snapped the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord’s neck. With that, the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord lost his life.

Huang Jingyu widened his mouth with disbelief as he watched this scene. Even Liu Yunlan was shocked with disbelief. Lin Yun had killed the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord.

As waves bellowed in Li Feibai’s heart, she said, “You just killed a holy land’s genius?”

“Are you afraid?” Lin Yun turned to look at Li Feibai.

Li Feibai was briefly stunned before she smiled; she naturally wasn’t afraid of a holy land.
