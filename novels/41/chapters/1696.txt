Chapter 1697 – Peerless Talent

All the elders in the hall were dumbfounded when they heard that musical note. It was only a single note, but they could sense an outburst of ferocity that made their scalps numb.

Mu Xueling also had a rare look of surprise on her face as her eyes were glued onto Lin Yun’s fingers. As one note after another was played by Lin Yun, they formed into a crimson streak, and it didn’t take long for the entire hall to be enveloped in a crimson light.

It was as though a demon was hidden in the Thunderstorm Zither, and Lin Yun slowly released it along with his zither music. When the music reached the climax, a phoenix cry echoed, and the music became cold, like winter.

There wasn’t any phoenix here, and the phoenix cry should be fake. But at this moment, the phoenix's cry sounded genuine, and his music sounded fake. This was because the ferocity contained within the phoenix cry was too intense.

The real and fake intertwined, making it hard for others to judge what was real and what was fake. As Lin Yun continued to play, countless crimson flames were released from his fingers.

“What’s going on?” Jiang Yu’s face gradually became ugly, and he became nervous. He began to wonder about Lin Yun’s true identity.

The crimson flames spread out and quickly formed into a crimson ocean. As waves rippled on the crimson ocean, a violent wind swept up, and no one dared to imagine that Lin Yun was only a musician based on his performance. All the elders were dumbfounded when they looked at Lin Yun and couldn’t describe their shock. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The heart of Gu Jun, who had a bet with Lin Yun, wasn’t calm. At this moment, he finally knew where Lin Yun’s confidence came from.

A different phoenix cry suddenly echoed within the Law Enforcement Hall. Compared to Lin Yun’s phoenix cry, which was filled with ferocity, this phoenix cry was elegant and prideful. It was also furious, but its cry sounded more ethereal than furious.

When everyone turned their heads over, they saw Mu Xueling also playing the Prairie Phoenix Fire. The two songs were identical, but their artistic concepts differed, including the phenomena manifested in their songs.

The two phoenixes started their fight in the hall, and the musical notes were like blades clashing together with sparks flying around.

When Lin Yun raised his head to look at Mu Xueling, he was surprised because Mu Xueling wasn’t just competing with him, but she was also teaching him the remaining score of the Prairie Phoenix Fire. After all, she had only previously taught a portion of the Prairie Phoenix Fire, and there were still two-thirds left.

The reason why she also started playing was to tell Lin Yun the remaining score. Then, she was shocked to discover that Lin Yun could play it perfectly after she had only played it once. She even purposely sped up and changed the tone, but Lin Yun casually kept up with her with a smile.

At the last note, Lin Yun’s musical notes manifested into a crimson phoenix. This was a phoenix purely manifested with crimson flames, and its pupils were filled with ferocity as it let out a sharp cry.

When the cry merged with the zither music, everyone who heard it was shocked. They began to feel uneasy and didn’t dare to look at the phoenix.

When the crimson phoenix and fire phoenix collided, flames splashed around. The crimson phoenix that belonged to Lin Yun was enveloped in torrential ferocity, with flames gushing from its pupils. Meanwhile, the fire phoenix that belonged to Mu Xueling became dim and was soon defeated by Lin Yun’s crimson phoenix.

“This…” The faces of the elders turned pale, and they didn’t know what to say. Even the Saint Elder personally made a move, but she couldn’t suppress Lin Yun. This was something that none of them had expected.

When Lin Yun and Mu Xueling both stopped, the music stopped. But no one could say a word when they looked at Lin Yun. it’s as though they forgot about the latter’s punishment.

“I’m done.” Lin Yun said, looking at Mu Xueling.

Mu Xueling briefly looked at Lin Yun before finally opening her mouth, “So I lived twenty-three years of my life in a dream and got to know that the phoenix isn’t a phoenix.”

The elders were all shocked because they knew how talented the Saint Elder was. She was a breathtaking musical genius, and her cultivation wasn’t weak. So one could imagine how high her compliment was for Lin Yun.

“Saint Elder, one song is finished. Time to enforce punishment on him.” Jiang Yu spoke out.

“Perhaps we should re-evaluate this again.” Mu Xueling said.

Gu Jun and the other elders weren’t surprised. When they heard Lin Yun play the first note, they already knew that the odds of him dying weren't high, even if the Profound Fairy came herself.

This was also where Lin Yun’s confidence laid in. Since he had the talent, why would he have to beg for mercy? Just as Gu Jun said, it was futile, no matter who came, unless Lin Yun was from a musician clan.

If Lin Yun was from a musician clan, the fault would be on Jiang Feng, who asked for it. He would have to pray to the gods if Lin Yun didn’t provoke him, not to mention him provoking Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was a peerless genius comparable to a genius from a musician clan.

“Then, my son suffered so much for nothing?!” Jiang Yu roared as his rage flared.

The other elders maintained their silence because they knew that Jiang Yu must be filled with grievances. But the Saint Elder was clearly determined to protect Lin Yun. So how could they speak up for him?

“Grand Elder, your son was the one who provoked Lin Xiao first. Lin Xiao might be a little ruthless, but he didn’t have a choice and was forced to retaliate.” Gu Jun said after a brief pondering.

“What do you mean? You’re saying that my son deserved it, then?” Jiang Yu finally lost it because that wasn’t what Gu Jun, that bastard, said earlier.

Gu Jun immediately wore an awkward expression and had no idea how to respond because that was precisely what he meant; Jiang Feng deserved it. Not only did he provoke Lin Yun first, but he even lost terribly.

It would have been fine if Lin Yun wasn’t so talented. But he had already proven that he was a peerless talent, and not even ten Jiang Fengs could compare to Lin Yun. With that, what actually happened was no longer important.

“What do you guys think?” Mu Xueling asked, but no one responded nor stood on Jiang Yu’s side; nor did anyone dare demand Lin Yun to be punished. Just like that, the Law Enforcement Hall fell into a strange silence.

“Elder Jiang, what do you think?” Mu Xueling’s gaze fell onto Jiang Yu, placing the latter under immense pressure.

“This matter has come to an end here, then. I will personally treat your son, and I will get a Great Saint to help if I can’t treat him..” Mu Xueling said. “Elder Jiang, what do you think?”

Jiang Yu’s face changed. He wanted to disagree, but he couldn’t say anything and could only fling his sleeve to the side before leaving. If he carried on, he would only be courting humiliation. As long as the Saint Elder was determined to protect Lin Yun, nothing would change, even if he brought this matter to the pavilion master.

“Lin Xiao!” Mu Xueling stood up and looked at Lin Yun.

“I’m here.” Lin Yun looked at Mu Xueling casually without any pressure.

“You seem to have already expected that you’d be fine after playing a song.” Mu Xueling said.

“I wouldn’t have done so if the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion was impartial. I wasn’t the one who started it, not to mention that I have ignored Jiang Feng multiple times and was forced to retaliate. I might have a good temper, but taking a beating is impossible.” Lin Yun replied.

“Your temper is really good, then!” Mu Xueling said with her brow raised.

“Thank you for your compliment, Saint Elder.” Lin Yun smiled with a wink.

Mu Xueling was stunned with fury flashing across her pupils at how shameless Lin Yun was. She said, “You can leave now. I don’t want to see you.”

Lin Yun nodded his head, but he had no intention of leaving. His gaze was glued on Gu Jun.

“What’s the matter? You don’t want to leave now and want to be punished?” Mu Xueling questioned.

“If I remember correctly, Elder Gu still owes me ten Profound Saint Pellets.” Lin Yun smiled.

This immediately made all the elders look at Gu Jun with shock. This was because ten Profound Saint Pellets wasn’t a small sum, and even Mu Xueling turned to look at Gu Jun.

“It was just a joke.” Gu Jun said awkwardly.

When Mu Xueling looked at Lin Yun, she could see a trace of smugness in his eyes. He was confident that she couldn’t do anything to him, which made her somewhat furious because this was the first time she had run into such a troublesome person ever since she left the mountain.

“There are no take-backs in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. You go with him to the Pellet Chamber and retrieve ten Profound Saint Pellets for him.” Mu Xueling was a little furious when she said that.

“Thank you, Saint Elder.” Lin Yun smiled with his hands cupped together.

“Come with me.” Gu Jun’s face was dark as he led Lin Yun out of the Law Enforcement Hall.

Only a short time after they left, three people came in. They were Yue Weiwei, Lin Wan, and Luo Shuyi. Their arrival left the Saint Elders briefly stunned because they never expected the Profound Fairy to come here, and they quickly bowed after recovering from their shock. “We greet Her Highness, the Profound Fairy!”

Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan became anxious when they couldn’t see Lin Yun anywhere.

“Why are you here?” Mu Xueling asked, looking at Yue Weiwei.

“Hehe. Isn’t it because I was bored? So I sneaked down to look for you.” Yue Weiwei smiled. Since she had an eccentric personality, she knew that her senior sister was strict and didn’t like her interfering with the Law Enforcement Hall’s matters.

Mu Xueling waved her hand to get the other elders to leave. When all the elders left, Yue Weiwei chuckled and came forth, holding onto Mu Xueling’s arm. She asked, “Senior Sister, where is he?”

“I knew that you were definitely not here to see me. He has already left.” Mu Xueling simply explained what happened in the hall.

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi were shocked while listening to Mu Xueling because they never expected it to develop in this manner. Lin Yun actually relied on his talent to make the Saint Elder protect him.

“If he hadn't played that song, would Senior Sister really have punished him?” Yue Weiwei asked unhappily.

“If he’s not so stubborn, I would investigate the entire matter thoroughly, and he wouldn’t suffer any grievances. But he’s really stubborn, and I have never seen someone so stubborn before. So I can’t be bothered with him.” Mu Xueling replied.

“So, Senior Sister admitted defeat, instead? How rare…” Yue Weiwei smiled as she held onto her chin.

When Mu Xueling sent a glare over, Yue Weiwei smiled and changed the topic, “Speaking of which, Lin Xiao’s personality is really similar to my Big Brother Yun.”

“I used the Heavenly Origin Mirror to shine on him, so he’s not Lin Yun. Don’t bother holding any hopes and focus on the Nine Heavenly Profound Dance.” Mu Xueling said.

“I’m only just saying it.” Yue Weiwei said as her pupils dimmed down.
