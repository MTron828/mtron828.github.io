Chapter 487 - Alright

Terrifying roars broke the silent night. The entire mountain range was covered in an ominous aura and countless crimson eyes glowed in the darkness. Shortly after, the ground began to tremble as the demonic beasts began their assault.

“Alert! Alert!” This commotion naturally alarmed the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples. They were startled awake and their faces were covered in shock. Shortly after, several disciples died horribly under the demonic beasts’ claws.

The commotion caused every disciples to bolt out of their tent and their faces became ugly when they saw this scene.

“Damn it…it’s the Draconian Rockrats!” Liu Yunyan’s face was cold when she looked at the three meter tall rat standing on two feet. The Draconian Rockrats were only in the eighth stage of the Profound Martial Realm, but they had sharp claws and shockingly strong defences. They were tough to deal with because they worked in packs.

“What’s going on?”

“Why did the Draconian Rockrats attack us for no reason…” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Damn it, there are too many of them.” The scene plunged into chaos as many disciples began to panic. But right at this moment, a powerful pressure was unleashed from mid-air. The pressure was coming from Liu Yunyan. She was in the lesser Yin stage and her aura made the Draconian Rockrats pause their assault for a brief moment.

“Die!” A cold light flickered in her eyes and she drew her sword. It merely took a swing for her to sever several Draconian Rockrats into two.

“Don’t panic. The demonic beasts are nothing to worry about with Senior Sister Liu here.” Liu Yunyan’s decisive action had calmed everyone’s emotions. When the disciples calmed down, they began to launch their attacks at the demonic beasts.

The battle broke out instantly and Lin Yun watched this scene calmly. The entire battle was a mess, but the situation had slightly calmed down once Liu Yunyan made her move. But this battle wouldn’t be easy. After all, there were three times as many Draconian Rockrats as there were disciples. Furthermore, there was something abnormal about them because they weren’t afraid of death.

Was it that person? Lin Yun recalled the raccoon masked man he saw during the day. He then swept his glance out trying to find Lu Siyin and found her fighting several demonic beasts with his Flower Burial Sword. Her cultivation was in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm, so she naturally wasn’t afraid of the Draconian Rockrats. But there were simply too many of them.

Lin Yun also discovered that Lu Siyin would occasionally look at the Flower Burial Sword in confusion. This sword that should be comparable to a cosmic artifact turned out to be no different than an ordinary weapon in her hand. Not only could it not enhance her power, but it weakened her instead. Looking at her lips, Lin Yun could guess that she must be cursing out. Clearly, she was feeling vexed that the sword was a huge letdown.

“You won’t be feeling vexed soon,” smiled Lin Yun.

“What’s going on?” Bai Yi came out of her tent at this moment and her face turned pale when she saw this scene. It was causing her to tremble. When she saw that Liu Yunyan was fighting the demonic beasts, she circulated her origin energy and charged forward without any hesitation.

But the moment she moved, a Draconian Rockrat pounced at her. The Draconian Rockrat descended from the sky as it brandished its claws at her head.

But all of a sudden, a silvery beam flew and penetrated the Draconian Rockrat’s head. As blood splattered, the demonic beast fell onto the ground. The troublesome Draconian Rockrat actually died in one attack from Lin Yun. This was because Lin Yun’s sword intent was the bane of demonic beasts proficient in defence.

The sudden death of the Draconian Rockrat left Bai Yi briefly stunned. But the danger wasn’t gone just because of that as the chaos in the camp reached its pinnacle. The demonic beasts got even more violent as their crimson eyes glowed fiercely like two flames.

At the same time, vague seals could be seen in their crimson pupils as if they were under control. The entire camp was bloody and the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples were having a tough time fending them off.

Liu Yunyan’s face was also ugly. She had no idea what was going on that the demonic beasts weren't being deterred by her aura. All of a sudden, she recalled Pan Yue’s eerie smile when they met earlier in the day.

“Bloodwing Pavilion!” Liu Yunyan was certain that this must have been caused by the Bloodwing Pavilion because they were trying to stop them from competing for the Indigoflame Goldlotus. But even if she guessed the reason, there was nothing she could do about this situation. She didn’t even know where her enemies were.

At the same time, ten-odd Draconian Rockrats pounced at Bai Yi. Bai Yi was stubborn and still charged towards Liu Yunyan’s direction, ignoring the danger. Every few steps, she would encounter a new danger.

“What a troublesome lass,” smiled Lin Yun bitterly as he dashed forward with the Seven Profound Steps. When he saw the ten-odd Draconian Rockrats, his eyes flashed coldly and he used his fingers as his sword.

When he pointed with his fingers, his sword intent pierced through the Draconian Rockrats’ foreheads, claiming their lives instantly.

“Big Brother Lin!” rejoiced Bai Yi. She quickly ran over and held onto the corner of Lin Yun’s clothes.

“You’re finally afraid now?” smiled Lin Yun bitterly.

Bai Yi revealed a bashful expression. However, she soon thought of something and rejoiced, “Big Brother Lin, y-you recovered your strength?”

“I guess,” smiled Lin Yun. He did recover his strength, but he wasn’t at full strength without his Flower Burial Sword.

“Wow!” Bai Yi’s eyes lit up with stars. She didn’t even see how the Draconian Rockrats died. This strength was already comparable to Liu Yunyan. One must know that Liu Yunyan was Bai Yi’s idol.

“Can you help us?” begged Bai Yi. The Heavenly Province Academy was in danger and she couldn’t imagine the consequences if this continued. She wanted Lin Yun to help after seeing how strong he was, not considering what Lin Yun went through because of the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples.

The disciples looked at him with disdain and called him a sword slave. Lu Siyin had stolen his Flower Burial Sword along with his treasures. Even Liu Yunyan looked at him in disdain. So why should Lin Yun help out? He was only concerned about one person here. Aside from Bai Yi, the life and death of the others was of no concern to him.

“Nope. Stay here and don’t go anywhere else. I can guarantee that none of those demonic beasts can harm you,” said Lin Yun calmly.

“I know that my senior brothers and sisters don’t like you and Senior Sister Lu even stole your sword, b-but Senior Sister Liu has treated me well,” said Bai Yi as her eyes turned red. She then bit her lips, “It’s fine if you don’t want to help, but I can’t stand here and do nothing about it!”

Lin Yun rubbed his forehead and he caved, “Alright, I’ll help you this once. But you have to promise me to stay here.”

“Okay. I knew that you were a good person and you would definitely help out,” smiled Bai Yi with a sly light flickering through her eyes. She nodded her head, “I’ll stay here obediently.”

She was happy. Not only was she happy that Lin Yun was willing to help, but also the fact that Lin Yun was a good person.

Looking at the sly light in Bai Yi’s eyes, Lin Yun smiled bitterly. Did this lass think that she won by playing some tricks?

Looking at Lin Yun’s gaze, Bai Yi’s face turned red. She then turned her gaze away, “Big Brother Lin, how are you going to help?”

Lin Yun closed his eyes briefly and spread out his sword intent. He could sense a bizarre fluctuation in the air. A brief moment later, he opened his eyes and he had a few ideas on resolving the situation. He turned to look at Bai Yi, “Promise me to stay here obediently. If anything happens to you, I’ll kill everyone here.”

His serious gaze caught Bai Yi by surprise, but she could only nod her head in the end. After Lin Yun left, Bai Yi suddenly thought of something and called out, “I promise you. B-but you also have to come back safely.”

Lin Yun turned around and looked at her with a smile. In the next second, he disappeared into the darkness.
