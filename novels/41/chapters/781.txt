Chapter 782 - Seven Elites

The banquet was extremely lively as Lin Yun waited for his next battle. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Jue Chen VS Ji Feng!” The surroundings became quiet when the judge announced the next battle as everyone turned their heated gazes over.

Who is Ji Feng? Lin Yun pondered briefly before he figured out who he was. Every single group had one of the three kings and seven elites. The one from the seventh group was Ji Feng. This person had never gone on stage as his opponents gave up the moment their name was called. This was why everyone had neglected him.

Lin Yun also neglected Ji Feng’s presence even though they were in the same group. The fight between Jue Chen and Ji Feng would be the first clash of the top ten. Jue Chen was Azurewood Pavilion’s chief disciple who was ranked number eight. Ji Feng was ranked number ten in the previous Draconic Banquet and he was the only one who did not originate from an overlord force. Although his ranking was the lowest, no one dared to underestimate him.

After all, the fact that he could make it into the top ten when he didn’t belong to any of the overlord forces was terrifying. However, it was against everyone’s expectation that the two would run into each other in the elimination round.

Their ranking was quite similar, so no one knew who would win after four years. The crowd would surely see a few trump cards this time around.

Lin Yun’s interest was also piqued by this battle. After all, he wanted to make it into the top ten where he would have to fight the three kings and seven elites. But after thinking about it, Lin Yun speculated that they wouldn’t fight for real since this wasn’t a ranking battle. For someone at the level of the three kings and seven elites, a loss was okay.

“Let’s determine the fight with one move,” said Ji Feng as he drew his saber.

“I had the same thoughts,” smiled Jue Chen. Neither of them wasted time since they didn’t want to reveal too much of their strength. This wasn’t the time to go all out since their true opponents were the three kings. They had to hold some things back even if it disappointed the crowd.

Ji Feng made the first move and clasped his hands in front of his chest. Then, a rumbling sound echoed out in everyone’s ears. All those who watched this scene unfold turned pale.

Facing Ji Feng, Jue Chen didn’t dare to be careless. He clasped his hands together and strands of green smoke began to leak out of his pores.

What powerful martial intent! Lin Yun was shocked because the sword intent around him shattered the moment they moved. But his sword intent soon recollected itself.

“That’s…” Lin Yun was shocked when he saw a pair of flaming wings behind Ji Feng. But the flames appeared for a split second before Ji Feng disappeared. Simultaneously, Ji Feng and Jue Chen attacked each other and disappeared from everyone’s sight.

In the next second, the lakewater exploded like the roar of a colossal dragon and shrouded the entire stage. After a while, the water finally settled down for everyone to see what happened.

“I lost.” Jue Chen coughed as he held onto his chest.

“This battle is nothing. The true battle is in the ranking round,” said Ji Feng.

“What happened?”

“Did you guys see it clearly?”

“Who the hell could possibly see that battle clearly?”

“It’s dangerous to watch the battle alone. The three kings and seven elites are too terrifying.” Everyone was alarmed by the power from the battle, but not many people could see the battle clearly. Most of them could only see that Jue Chen had lost.

Lin Yun had seen the entire battle clearly. Ji Feng’s flame intent had manifested into a pair of wings while Jue Chen had a towering tree behind him. Ji Feng won in the end as the flaming feathers incinerated all the leaves on the tree.

But before the tree was completely incinerated, it moved like a dragon and destroyed many of the flaming feathers. If the battle continued, the result might not be the same. However, Jue Chen was in a disadvantageous position from the first exchange.

For experts at their level, cultivation by itself was no longer important. The comprehension of martial intent, cultivation, and the combination of the two was most important. Although Lin Yun was only able to see a short exchange, he still benefited greatly.

At this moment, he understood how fortunate he was to have grasped the spiritual sword intent. If he ran into them with his xiantian sword intent in complete mastery, he wouldn’t be able to last more than three moves, especially since their insight in martial intent wasn’t any weaker than his xiantian sword intent.

The three kings and seven elites truly deserved their reputation. This battle also caused a huge commotion as it allowed everyone to gain a new understanding of the three kings and seven elites’ strength.

“He actually got so strong after four years. I can’t even see what happened in their battle.”

“There’s still a clear difference between the top ten and the rising geniuses.”

“I don’t think anyone new can make it into the top ten.”

Those who felt that Lin Yun could make it into the top ten weren’t so optimistic anymore. Among the other groups, Lin Yun noticed one expert who revealed his strength in the elimination round.

The expert was a youth dressed in black robes while wearing a hood. His weapon of choice was the saber. Although his performance wasn’t dazzling in the first round, he was able to slice the top-tier genius who was ranked twenty first. He was the only other genius aside from Lin Yun to slay a top-tier genius and he did this in just ten moves. He displayed an incredibly violent saber technique to do so.

But this person, Zhu Qingshan, no longer concealed himself after this battle. His name became famous after the battle and placed pressure on those in the same group as him.

“Lin Yun VS Feng Wudao!” While everyone spoke about Zhu Qingshan’s bloodthirsty nature, Lin Yun’s name was called. Immediately, the crowd became excited and turned towards Lin Yun’s stage.

After Lin Yun defeated Bai Ling, his fame almost reached the level of the three kings and seven elites. After all, everyone could feel the grace of a swordsman from him. As for Feng Wudao, he was a ferocious figure who hadn’t lost a single match. The profound amber aura in his jade token was simply too bright.

“Something interesting is about to happen. I wonder who will maintain their winning streak.”

“Lin Yun, of course!”

“Feng Wudao isn’t weak either. He was the first newly risen genius to defeat a top-tier genius.” Feng Wudao and Lin Yun had many supporters. However, the majority of the crowd supported Lin Yun. The supporters wanted to see how far Weng Wudao would push Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun was too mysterious and no one knew how many trump cards he had.

“Looks like no one is optimistic about my chances.” Feng Wudao smiled as he could hear the conversations from the surroundings quite clearly. But the talk of the crowd didn’t seem to bother him.

“You’re strong. But it will be difficult for you to beat me,” replied Lin Yun. Lin Yun had respect for a genius like Feng Wudao, but he was speaking the truth. Feng Wudao might have trump cards, but Lin Yun also had his own trump cards. Even though this was the truth, it wouldn’t be pleasant to Feng Wudao’s ears.

“Hmph, a piece of garbage like you really thinks that you’re the strongest after the three kings and seven elites?” Feng Wudao’s face sank and snorted, “Your xiantian sword intent is only at greater mastery. You’ll lose this match.”

Feng Wudao’s face radiated with great confidence as a bolt of lightning tore the horizon apart. Under the lightning, Feng Wudao’s face was sinister.

“Lightning intent at the pinnacle greater mastery!” Many people narrowed their eyes because they never expected that Feng Wudao’s lightning intent would be this powerful. On top of being at a high level, Feng Wudao could control it as he wished to enveloped the entire stage.

Lightning continued to flash around the stage under Feng Wudao’s control. Compared to sword intent’s carefree nature, lightning intent was a lot more violent.

Lin Yun narrowed his eyes because Feng Wudao would be a tough opponent. It looks like the Draconic Banquet is getting more interesting.
