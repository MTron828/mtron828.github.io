Chapter 311 - Die!

“Everlasting Originmurk!”

“Fiery Dragon Burst!”

“Golden Brilliance!”

“Stunning Cloud!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Chu Haoyu, Chang Wu, Jiang Feng, and Ye Xiu all executed their strongest moves, which caused huge turbulence in the air. Even the sea of flames blazed even more ferociously. Amid the noise, Lin Yun stood like a lone raft facing a tidal wave. Before he could even react, he was already devoured by the waves.

“Junior Brother Lin!” Lin Qiushan exclaimed from the border. She couldn’t bear to keep watching because four people attacking Lin Yun together had exceeded her expectations.

“The show is just beginning!” Bai Ting stroked his beard on the Sword Condor.

Next to Bai Ting, Luo Feng wore a grave expression full of concern. It was just as Bai Ting had expected. These people would definitely try to eliminate Lin Yun since they determined him to be the weakest. With how decisive Chu Haoyu was, he definitely wouldn’t give up such a good opportunity to kill Lin Yun.

“Great!” Wang Yan yelled from the observation platform with joy on his face. The Gentlemen Union’s disciples also had the joy on their faces. Lin Yun was lucky to be in the top five, but he was courting death trying to become the champion. In the end, it went just as everyone had expected. Lin Yun would be eliminated first.

“Junior Brother Lin, please stay safe.” Xin Yan’s heart throbbed as her countenance was drained of color. Her gaze was fixed on the Sword Tomb.

There were many people in the Sword Tomb previously and the participants weren’t able to see everything carefully. But now, everything could be clearly seen. The elders and leaders of the various alliance-unions suddenly stood up and looked in a single direction.

Lin Yun stood calmly in the Sword Tomb as Jiang Feng’s palm reached him. Under the empowerment of the Originmurk Art in complete mastery, the density of Jiang Feng’s origin energy reached an unbelievable height. He suppressed everything in his path.

“This palm of mine is more than enough to suppress you!” smirked Jiang Feng.

Sword gleams flashed in another direction, along with a golden brilliance and the roar of a flaming dragon. Lin Yun didn’t have time to think more about it because he knew that he would die if he was distracted.

The violet origin energy within his body surged and filled his body. Looking at Jiang Feng who was getting closer, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed. Jiang Feng wanted to suppress him? That was simply a pipe dream!

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun retaliated with a palm of his own. The two palms created a deafening explosion when they collided. Jiang Feng groaned as his face changed. A flash of surprise filled his eyes when he felt that he couldn’t take another step forward against Lin Yun’s palm.

Ever since the Originmurk Art reached greater mastery, Jiang Feng rarely encountered someone else with stronger origin energy than him.

“What cultivation technique are you practising…” questioned Jiang Feng.

“Don’t worry about it. Get lost!” yelled Lin Yun. The Iris Flower in his Dantian blossomed and sixty-four petals appeared. Lin Yun had finally unleashed the full prowess of the Iris Sword Sutra for the first time after reaching the eighth stage.

As Lin Yun glowed with violet radiance, he pushed his palm forward. Jiang Feng threw up a mouthful of blood and was sent flying. He was in a sorry state. The spectators couldn’t see anything, but they could sense the astonishing origin energy collision in the Sword Tomb.

Before Lin Yun could catch his breath, a ray of golden brilliance came at him. It was Ye Xiu who was circulating the Golden Vajra Body to the limit. His skin turned cold like an ancient bell, which released ripples into the surroundings.

Lin Yun did not dare to be careless and activated the Dracophant Battle Physique and the dracophant energy flowed throughout his body. He faced Ye Xiu head-on. A huge explosion occurred. Lin Yun took three steps back, while Ye Xiu took ten steps back before he managed to stabilize himself.

But before Lin Yun could regain his footing, a sword flash reached him. This attack was filled with a murderous aura. In another direction, a flame dragon charged forward after leaving Chang Wu’s right arm. Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu had both executed their strongest attacks.

Under their terrifying aura, the ancient swords on the ground began to tremble and sway, releasing brilliant sword intent. In that split second, no one knew about the dangers Lin Yun was in. But Lin Yun made a decision instantly and circulated the Iris Sword Sutra. His fingers joined together and formed an ancient seal, the Undying Vajra Seal.

Before Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu reached him, Lin Yun pushed his palms forward and an outburst of blazing origin energy exploded like the roar of a vajra. But it was a pity that Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu were both monsters among monsters. Their attacks crushed most of the origin energy that came their way.

But the brief delay was more than enough for Lin Yun. He executed the Seven Profound Steps—Golden Crow Wings. A golden crow seal dazzled on his back and Lin Yun spread his arms apart. His arms turned golden like a pair of wings and he gently flapped them to avoid Chu Haoyu and Chang Wu’s attacks.

Lin Yun immediately followed up with the Seven Profound Steps—Shadow Verse, leaving afterimages in his path. When he took nine steps out, Lin Yun was filled with the might of a dragon and a tiger. After using the golden crow seal, Lin Yun actually performed the Dragon-Tiger Steps in mid-air.

After taking nine steps forward, Lin Yun faced the flaming dragon. He threw out a punch that was empowered by the Undying Vajra Seal, which sent Chang Wu back to where he came from and destroyed the flaming dragon.

This left Chang Wu shocked. After he retreated a hundred meters, he did an overhead flip in mid-air and slammed his palm on a sword. He only managed to negate Lin Yun’s power after a few flips. While he was refining the origin energy and sword aura in his body, Lin Yun wasn’t able to do that and was still submerged in flames.

Lin Yun immediately turned around and threw out a punch. With blood dripping from the corner of his lips, Lin Yun was sent flying a hundred meters away. As all his accumulated injuries flared up, Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood before he felt some relief.

“Take another punch of mine!” Ye Xiu charged over. When he threw his punch, it actually released faint saintly music.

“You’re just in time!” laughed Lin Yun.

“This fellow…he’s insane…” Chang Wu was shocked. He never expected that Lin Yun was still filled with fighting spirit after facing all four of their attacks. He clenched his fist together, gathering the flames in his fist and charged over at Lin Yun once more together with Chu Haoyu.

The surging flames on the ground did not fall and the origin energy contained in the fluctuation spread out, which made the sea of flames blaze even more ferociously. In just a split second, the three of them exchanged over ten moves with Lin Yun.

Their attacks were lethal, but Lin Yun relied on the Seven Profound Steps to deal with them. Occasionally, he would launch a counterattack. The expected scene of Lin Yun being defeated instantly did not happen. In fact, they were in a rather sorry state, which made them frown their eyebrows.

After ten moves, they landed on the swords for a break.

“You guys can continue if you think that I’m a pushover!” Lin Yun glared at the three of them coldly. Chu Haoyu, Chang Wu, and Ye Xiu all sensed that Lin Yun wasn’t easy to deal with after the brief fight. The injuries on their bodies was proof of this.

“But you’ll be the first to be eliminated!” A figure suddenly appeared behind Lin Yun. He drew his sword and slashed down at Lin Yun. It was Jiang Feng, who hid himself to wait for an opportunity to attack. He had already been preparing his attack for a long time, and if his attack connected, it would, at the very least, cripple Lin Yun.

“You’re courting death!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with fury. His figure became blurred, which left Jiang Feng stunned. He actually couldn’t sense Lin Yun anymore because Lin Yun soared into the sky like a golden sun. When Jiang Feng missed his attack, his heart sank.

“Die!” Not giving him any chance to escape, Lin Yun’s fist landed on Jiang Feng’s chest. The sound of ribs cracking echoed out. A huge hole appeared in Jiang Feng’s chest and he was sent flying away like a sandbag. This scene had caused a huge uproar on the observation platform because someone was finally eliminated.

“Haha! Old geezer, what else do you have to say?” Bai Ting laughed when he saw a figure flying out.

On the other hand, Luo Feng’s face was pale. He couldn’t sense any vitality coming from that figure who was sent flying out. But Luo Feng suddenly raised his brow and poured his origin energy into his eyes before he finally caught a clear glimpse of that figure’s face.
