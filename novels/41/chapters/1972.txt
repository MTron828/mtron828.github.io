Chapter 1973 - Battle Beneath The Pool

The bottom of the pool was glittering gold, with silver saint radiance shining down. Bai Shuying’s skin was pearly white, and she had a voluptuous figure without flaws.

Under the radiance, she looked like a goddess, and Lin Yun was stumped when he looked at her. She was too beautiful, especially at the bottom of the Celestial Pool. She looked so beautiful that no one could think about blasphemy against her, and Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling guilty in the depths of his heart.

When he saw Bai Shuying’s eyelashes twitching, Lin Yun panicked and yelled, “Quick, give me the mask!”

Lin Yun transmitted his voice to Lil’ Purple. He initially didn’t think he would need it, and his first reaction was wearing it when Bai Shuying woke up. This was like a child who made a mistake, their first reaction was to hide their identity.

“I have already prepared it for you.” Lil’ Purple was already prepared, and she put the mask on Lin Yun’s face when he asked for it.

When Bai Shuying suddenly opened her eyes, Lin Yun’s the nirvana aura was empowered by a thunderstorm and formed into a water dragon that charged forth. Due to the violent turbulence within the pool, Bai Shuying couldn’t see who attacked her.

“Such impudence!” Bai Shuying’s face became cold as she allowed that lightning dragon to get close to her. When it was a foot away from her, saint radiance shone within her pupils as an ancient power started gushing out. The sheer power shattered the water dragon, and she could see a silver figure wanting to escape.

But Bai Shuying had no changes on her face as she gently raised her hand. When a golden and silver radiance shone on her wrist, it soon formed into a dome barrier, instantly enveloping Lin Yun. When the dome was formed, the water in the surrounding area was pushed away.

Seeing this, Lin Yun let out a breath and he tried his best to maintain his composure. But no matter how calm he was, he couldn’t help feeling distracted when he saw Bai Shuying’s naked body.

“How do I look?” Bai Shuying asked indifferently.

Beautiful… Lin Yun wanted to reply subconsciously, but a powerful palm flew over. The power behind this palm easily sent him flying away, before he collided against the bottom of the pool from the momentum. The colossal impact sent a great shock to Lin Yun’s ten dragon pulses with a stabbing pain. It felt like he was pressed against the wall by an invisible hand and he was powerless against it.

“Be careful. That’s the Dragon Snapping Hand!” Lil’ Purple warned. This attack caught her by surprise and injured her back then. This palm technique wasn’t only powerful, but it was also vicious. As a result, she couldn’t use many of her means and suffered greatly because of it.

Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered too much for now. The star within his sword sea began to bloom. When he released his Astral Sword Intent, he easily broke free of the pressure and slipped out; when he slipped out from the attack, a palm print was created on the wall that made Lin Yun’s scalp tingle.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The walls at the bottom of the Celestial Pool were clearly specially forged and engraved with powerful saint runes. But Bai Shuying easily smashed the wall with a palm.

“Quick, leave! Don’t get entangled with her. There’s something weird about her!” Lil’ Purple urged.

Lin Yun also knew that he couldn’t stay here for long and had no intentions of subduing Bai Shuying. Most importantly, he was the one at fault. He peeked at someone showering and was discovered. Lin Yun didn’t have the cheek to stay here, at least not before Bai Shuying.

Lin Yun gently tapped his foot on the ground and dashed forth. This made Bai Shuying, who was planning to put on her clothes, frown her brows. She soared to the sky and immediately appeared before Lin Yun with a saint sword. When she swung her sword down, she unleashed a terrifying sword ray.

Quasi-Astral Sword Intent? Lin Yun was shocked that Bai Shuying grasped the Quasi-Astral Sword Intent, which meant she had been hiding this deeply. Furthermore, she had empowered her attack with a fire and ice stream, they were her two martial intents. This made her sword even more terrifying.

Two years ago, when Lin Yun was pursuing his ranking on the Elysium Core Ranking, he fought with Bai Shuying’s clone on the ranking, but he could barely win the battle.

Two years have passed, and Bai Shuying had become harder to deal with. This forced Lin Yun back to the bottom of the lake, filled with silver radiance. The temperature in the surrounding water became scorching hot, and he wouldn’t have been able to last within the high temperature if he didn’t have the two saint physiques.

In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun exchanged over ten-odd moves with Bai Shuying at the bottom of the Celestial Pool. But Lin Yun didn’t attack, just merely dodged Bai Suying’s attacks. Several times he almost retaliated by instinct, but he held himself back.

On the contrary, Bai Shuying’s attacks became even more ferocious, containing her powerful nirvana aura. Her cultivation was much higher than Lin Yun’s, and Lin Yun would fall into a disadvantageous position if they fought for real. But if Bai Shuying continued to entangle with him, he would have no choice but to draw his sword.

But what’s more troublesome was the dome barrier keeping the water from pouring down, making the surrounding temperature even hotter than a furnace.

Bai Shuying unleashed more than ten-odd swords, and she was long covered in sweat. But he didn’t dare to take another glance at her. She was a goddess just a moment ago and was covered in sweat now. It was hard for him to describe it in words.

He couldn’t draw his sword or look at her, and he would die sooner or later if this continued. He knew he couldn’t continue like this, so he took a deep breath before moving. He dodged to the side before dashing back and grabbing Bai Shuying’s wrist.

Bai Shuying struggled and was surprised to discover she couldn’t break free. But her face remained unchanged as she struck forth at Lin Yun’s chest with her other hand. But as the Silvermoon Mask shone, saint runes appeared on Lin Yun’s chest, blocking Bai Shuying’s strike.

“If I was hostile towards you, I would have at least snapped your wrist at this opportunity,” Lin Yun coughed and said hoarsely. Even with the Silvermoon Mask protecting his vitals, this attack still injured Lin Yun pretty badly.

Bai Shuying’s face slightly changed, but she still coldly said, “You can try it.”

“I believe there’s a misunderstanding between us,” Lin Yun tried to explain.

“There’s no misunderstanding!” Bai Shuying said coldly. “You’re the one who fooled Zhang Yue and wrote that poem. That little girl is also in cahoots with you!”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled upon hearing that because he knew the misunderstanding couldn’t be resolved now.

But the dome barrier suddenly cracked before it crumbled. This instantly made Lin Yun’s face change because the water was hotter than magma, and it wouldn’t feel great on them if it fell. Even Bai Shuying’s face changed when she saw this scene.

“Move out of the way!” Lin Yun released Bai Shuying’s hand and retreated to the side.

But just when Bai Shuying wanted to make a move, the dome barrier crumbled, and she took a heavy backlash because she had engraved her saint rune on the barrier. This naturally made Bai Shuying’s reaction speed a tad slower.

This scene changed Lin Yun’s face, and he quickly dashed forth. As a pair of wings appeared behind him, the sword box he was carrying was knocked to the side, and the water that was hotter than magma began to pour down. The heavy impact made Lin Yun groan as blood dripped down his lips beneath the mask.

But because Lin Yun stood out, Bai Shuying was well protected under the wings, and they were in an ambiguous posture. They could hear each other’s heartbeats, and time seemed to have stopped as Lin Yun embraced Bai Shuying’s waist with his wings enveloping them.
