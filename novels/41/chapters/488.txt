The slap sent Lu Siyin flying and all the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples were dumbfounded. After all, it was shocking for them that Lin Yun returned, not to mention that he even gave Lu Siyin a slap.

“You dare to hit me?” Lu Siyin’s right cheek was swollen from the slap. She couldn’t accept the fact that she had just been slapped by a sword slave.

“So what? You’re just a cheap bitch,” sneered Lin Yun as his eyes flashed coldly. When he returned, the first thing he saw was Lu Siyin trying to slap Bai Yi. So how could he take it lying down?

“You’re insulting me?!” Lu Siyin’s eyes flared as her body began to tremble. She roared, “I’ll kill you!”

She pounced towards Lin Yun as her hand formed a claw that was aimed at Lin Yun’s head. Her face was distorted from rage. “Die you sword slave!”

“Ignorant,” replied Lin Yun as he gave her a slap on her left cheek this time. Lu Siyin was knocked into the sky this time and spun three times in the air from the slap. When she fell onto the ground, both her cheeks were heavily swollen.

“Senior Sister Lu!” Leng Feng raged when he saw this scene and yelled, “Let’s kill him!”

Instantly, all the disciples who had a good relationship with Lu Siyin charged forth.

“What ignorance,” muttered Lin Yun as he threw his punch forward. A dragon and tiger roar echoed out and his fist glowed with a silvery light. His fist was like a sword that stabbed out, not to mention that it was further empowered by his sword energy. When it reached Leng Feng, it instantly crushed Leng Feng’s aura.

When the punch reached Leng Feng’s chest, it crushed him like a sandbag. Then, Lin Yun turned to look at the other disciples charging to him. His gaze instantly sent a chill down all their spines as they looked at Leng Feng who was sent flying with a punch. They held onto their weapons with trembling hands. None of them dared to step forward.

“Damn it...how is this possible?” Lu Siyin was completely dumbfounded by this scene. She couldn’t contain the shock in her eyes because she couldn’t understand why a sword slave was so powerful.

Right at this moment, a figure descended from the sky. It was Liu Yunyan. She looked at Lu Siyin before turning to look at Leng Feng who was groaning out in pain on the ground. She spoke out coldly, “It’s a joyful matter that you’re able to recover your strength. But aren’t you a little too harsh with your attacks?”

“I don’t offend others when they don’t offend me. Lu Siyin should be glad that she didn’t slap Bai Yi. Otherwise, I would have severed her hand by now,” said Lin Yun coldly without any emotions. The killing aura in his tone made everyone feel a chill run down their spines. All of the disciples became enraged. Lin Yun was simply too arrogant and his actions had completely disregarded the Heavenly Province Academy.

After all, Lu Siyin and Bai Yi’s conflict was between them, so Lin Yun was in no place to poke his nose in it.

“Looks like you’re not feeling regretful at all. It doesn't matter why you attacked, but you’ll pay the price for harming someone from the Heavenly Province Academy!” barked Liu Yunyan coldly.

In the next second, ten-odd disciples pounced in Lin Yun’s direction. But Lin Yun maintained his composure when he looked at those coming in his way.

Right at this moment, the Flower Burial Sword in Lu Siyin’s hand began to tremble as it spiraled out of her control. “Damn it, stop moving!”

Lu Siyin held onto the sword with both her hands in a panic. But did she think that she could stop the sword with just that?

“Sword!” barked Lin Yun. Immediately, the Flower Burial Sword flew into his hand.

“It has been tough on you…” Lin Yun muttered as he completely disregarded the disciples who were charging at him. This enraged them even further because Lin Yun was looking down on them. But in the next second, they instantly regretted it.

Lin Yun swept his gaze out with a smile on his lips. The Flower Burial Sword shared a deep connection with him, so it released a dazzling radiance in the next second. In his hand, the Flower Burial Sword had transformed completely and it was simply unstoppable.

Lin Yun felt the sword buzzing, a fire blazed in his heart. When the Iris Flower bloomed, boundless origin energy poured into the sword. Raising the sword, Lin Yun slashed it down, which sent the ten-odd disciples flying out. Each of their faces became pale as they threw up a mouthful of blood.

“Damn it…”

“How is this possible!” All of them exclaimed with fear in their eyes.

Right at this moment, a sword ray flew towards Lin Yun. It came from Liu Yunyan and her attack swept up a gale before it even reached him.

In the name of my sword, bloom!

The Iris Flower in Lin Yun’s dantian revolved and an Iris Flower appeared in the sky. At the same time, Lin Yun swung the sword in his hand. When the two attacks clashed, the ground trembled violently from their collision.

He blocked it? Liu Yunyan was surprised. She was in the lesser Yin stage and Lin Yun was able to block her attack? Just how did Lin Yun cultivate his origin energy?

There were no changes to Lin Yun’s face as he relied on his powerful physique to endure the powerful gale and pushed his sword even further. Along with an enraged roar from the Flower Burial Sword, Liu Yunyan’s face changed as she was blown back.

When Liu Yunyan landed on the ground, the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples were all dumbfounded by this unbelievable scene. Liu Yunyan, who was in the lesser Yin stage, was forced back by Lin Yun? This was simply unimaginable to them.

Just when Liu Yunyan was about to charge back forward, Lin Yun pointed his sword at Liu Yunyan, which made her stop her movements. Lin Yun spoke out, “Liu Yunyan, I don’t like you, but there’s no grudge between us. So don’t force me. Otherwise, no one else will remain standing aside from you after I’m done.”

Damn it! Liu Yunyan gnashed her teeth because she knew what Lin Yun said was the truth. A short moment later, she calmed down and replied, “Leave. I don’t wish to duke it out with you.”

“Leave? I will, but I’m not finished. I still haven’t taken back what’s mine!” Lin Yun’s words made Lu Siyin start panicking.

“Bitch, come here!” Lin Yun poured his aura into his sword and grabbed Lu Siyin before she could even react. He grabbed onto Lu Siyin’s neck and he lifted her off the ground. He asked, “Where is my stuff?”

“What stuff?”

“The beast core, the cosmic artifact, the secret treasure, and the painting,” said Lin Yun.

“What a joke. Do you think I’ll take something that belongs to a sword slave like you?” Lu Siyin was panicking, but she knew that she couldn’t admit it right now. If she did, then she would lose all her reputation in the academy and her life would be ruined.

“Lin Yun, Senior Sister Lu didn’t take your stuff. Let her go!” The Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples yelled when they saw Lu Siyin’s pathetic state.

“You didn’t steal them?” laughed Lin Yun.

“I didn’t. I, Lu Siyin, wouldn’t lower myself to steal something that belongs to a sword slave!” said Lu Siyin with her teeth gnashed.

“You didn’t steal?” Lin Yun gave her a third slap without any hesitation then he continued to rain down a barrage of slaps on her face. Before anyone could react, Lin Yun had already given her nine slaps that took half the life out of her.

“Stop it!” The Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples’ faces changed when they saw this scene. Liu Yunyan also couldn’t hold back any longer because Lin Yun was too ruthless. She had decided that she would take him down even if she had to give up on the Indigoflame Goldlotus.

“S-s-s-stop. I did steal them,” cried Lu Siyin. This instantly left Liu Yunyan, who was going to act, just as stupefied as the other disciples. Lu Siyin really stole them? A disciple of the Heavenly Province Academy was actually so despicable?

“Take them out,” barked Lin Yun.

Lu Siyin sobbed as she began to take out the things she stole out of her interspatial pouch.

“A Heavenly Soul Realm’s beast core!”

“A cosmic artifact!”

“A secret treasure!”

“My heavens, she actually stole so much stuff!” Every time Lu Siyin took out an item, it would cause an uproar in the surroundings. When she took them all out, everyone was shocked. Even Liu Yunyan trembled with a pale face. So what Lin Yun said was true all along.

After storing everything, Lin Yun’s face was still dark as he questioned, “Where’s the painting!”

“It’s not with me. It’s with him…” Lu Siyin was terrified by Lin Yun’s glare, so she pointed at Leng Feng.

When Lin Yun turned his gaze over, Leng Feng began to run without any hesitation, “Damn it, don’t think of taking it back now that it’s in my hands!”

But he only took three steps out before he was pierced by a sword ray. Lin Yun retrieved the interspatial pouch and found the painting. With that, he finally felt relieved. He had taken back all of his things.

But when he raised his head, the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples took several steps back with fear in their eyes. He might have been a little too ruthless in their eyes, but Lin Yun wasn’t too bothered with how they looked at him. He wouldn’t offend others if they didn’t offend him, but he would repay them tenfold if they offended him. Regardless if it was Lu Siyin or Leng Feng, they both violated his bottomline.
