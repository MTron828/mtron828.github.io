Chapter 1085 - What Has Other People’s Gazes Got To Do With Me?!

Even Lin Yun who was about to ascend the ship was puzzled. Does this Sword Sect have anything to do with the Sword Sect that was annihilated in the Profound Amber Realm? Then again, it would make no sense if the two weren’t related to each other. After all, the Sword Sect back in the Profound Amber Realm was extremely powerful, and it would make no sense if they didn’t have an inheritance in Kunlun Realm.

But three thousand years ago, the Sword Sect was annihilated in the Profound Amber Realm. Senior Jian Wuming was someone who had inherited a portion of the Sword Sect and founded the Sword Firmament Pavilion in the Great Qin Empire. It seemed like he had some connections with the Sword Sect. Then again, all of this was based on the prerequisite that both Sword Sects were connected to each other.

While Lin Yun was in deep thoughts, a figure approached and tore through the starry sky like a sharp sword. Instantly, a casually dressed young man appeared before them. He didn’t look old, but his pupils were radiating with age. Clearly, he wasn’t as young as he appeared.

The various sects’ elders instantly recognized this person, Feng Jue of the Sword Sect. After recognizing this person, the shock on their faces grew even deeper. However, their eyes were filled with confusion because the Sword Sect actually sent out Feng Jue.

The Sword Sect had a huge reputation and was well-known in Kunlun Realm. At their strongest, they far surpassed the sects in the Ancient Barren Domain. Even though they had declined over the years, they were still a famous overlord in the Ancient Barren Domain.

But the Sword Sect had never participated in the Heavenly Path. It wasn’t because the geniuses in the Heavenly Path couldn’t catch their attention, but because they had a conflict with the Sacred Alliance. No one knew what their conflict was about, including some of the upper leaders of the Sword Sect.

Furthermore, no one could imagine what the conflict was since the Sacred Alliance had always been neutral. In a nutshell, the Sword Sect had never participated in the Heavenly Path, which was why everyone was shocked.

Elder Jin Jue was especially worried because he knew that killing Lin Yun wouldn’t be simple anymore. At the very least, an elder like him couldn’t do anything against the Sword Sect’s protection.

“Feng Jue! Your Sword Sect doesn’t have the qualification to recruit disciples in the Heavenly Path. Have you asked the Sacred Alliance about it?!” Elder Jin Jue spoke with gnashed teeth. In the Ancient Barren Domain, everyone knew about the conflict between the Profound Sky Sect and Sword Sect. So now that Feng Jue had represented the Sword Sect to recruit Lin Yun, the Sword Sect was standing against the Profound Sky Sect once more.

“Luo Qingxu, does the Sword Sect need the Sacred Alliance’s permission to recruit disciples?” Feng Jue grinned. His impolite tone instantly drew the ill gazes of the Sacred Alliance’s party on the ship.

“Hehe.” The young man smiled before he glared at the ship. It caused everyone on the ship to let out a groan as if their souls were being stabbed by a sword.

The person in charge of the Sacred Alliance, Luo Qingxu, became silent. He had no idea what the Sword Sect was planning. After all, there were ancestral teachings in the Sword Sect that they would never receive anything from the Sacred Alliance, form an alliance with them, or come in contact with them.

Feng Jue’s arrival had already violated the ancestral teachings of the Sword Sect. This made the other elders nervous, especially Elder Jin Jue. The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s matter involved a powerhouse in the Profound Sky Sect. So Elder Jin Jue had no idea what he would say if he couldn’t kill Lin Yun.

“As long as you have enough strength, anyone can come here to recruit disciples without the Sacred Alliance’s acknowledgment. It’s fine if you want to take him away with you, but you need his agreement.” Luo Qingxu’s words caused many people’s faces to change. Then again, they weren’t surprised by it because the Sacred Alliance held this event to give those from the lower realms an opportunity to go to Kunlun Realm.

“As a swordsman, who isn’t willing to join my Sword Sect? Brat, are you willing to come with me?” Feng Jue spoke confidently when he looked at Lin Yun. Everyone looked at Lin Yun in jealousy. Who could’ve imagined that Lin Yun’s would suddenly get recruited by the Sword Sect? After all, the Sword Sect was a sacred ground in the Ancient Barren Domain for swordsmen.

Lin Yun merely looked at Feng Jue calmly and replied, “Agree to one of my requests and I’ll come with you. Otherwise, I will refuse.”

A huge uproar came from the crowd after Lin Yun spoke. A sect was willing to accept him, but he was making demands? Wasn’t he a little too bold? If this made Feng Jue furious, Lin Yun would be doomed.

Everyone could tell that Feng Jue had quite the temper by the way he spoke to the Sacred Alliance. At this instance, many people sneaked peeks at Feng Jue trying to see how he would react.

Elder Jin Jue was dumbfounded because he had never seen someone with such a huge attitude. Someone who had been forsaken actually dared to speak of a request? In his eyes, Lin Yun was practically courting death.

“What is Big Brother Yun thinking?” Yue Weiwei was anxious, especially when Chen Xun’s became confused.

“Speak, what request do you have,” Feng Jue frowned his eyebrows unhappily. At this moment, he made up his mind to leave if Lin Yun gave an outrageous request. After all, Lin Yun was just a junior. There was no way he would tolerate disrespect.

“I want to kill him. One day in the future, I’ll kill that old bastard personally. I would just like to see if the Sword Sect has the courage to permit it!” Lin Yun said coldly while he pointed at Elder Jin Jue. The killing intent in his tone was so sharp that some people forgot to breathe.

Everyone knew how strong Elder Jin Jue was since the geniuses on the Saint Spiritual Lake couldn’t tell his cultivation. At the very least, they knew what he was in the Divine Core Realm. So it would be easy for someone like him to crush Lin Yun. After all, an Empyrean was enough to kill Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s words were akin to a bomb. They also made Elder Jin Jue’s expression freeze. The other elders were dumbfounded as they looked at Lin Yun. They thought that they knew how arrogant Lin Yun was in the final battle, but it turns out that they had still underestimated him. After all, Lin Yun just publicly announced that he would kill Jin Jue in the future!

Even those from the Sacred Alliance had a shock on their faces. They finally understood why no one wanted to recruit Lin Yun. Even though Lin Yun wanted to kill Jin Jue, why did he have to announce it right now? Would he even reach that level in the future? In their eyes, Lin Yun was just courting death.

The elders who were hesitant about recruiting Lin Yun earlier shook their heads and rejoiced inwardly. After all, Lin Yun didn’t seem like he would live long in Kunlun Realm.

“Can the Sword Sect allow that?” Lin Yun ignored all the other gazes and asked. He was practically certain that it was Elder Jin Jue who destroyed his sword aura back in Wind Mound City. There was also the fact that he made Yue Weiwei beg for mercy.

Even the lowest person had their own dignity, not to mention Lin Yun. He didn’t have to explain to anyone why he wanted to kill, but he needed to know if it was permitted. Raising his head, Lin Yun looked at Feng Jue and asked once more, “Can the Sword Sect permit this request?”

“Hahaha!” Feng Jue was dumbfounded. When he recovered from his shock, he began to laugh out loud, “Your request is permitted. Even if the Sword Sect doesn’t permit you, I’ll permit you! As swordsmen, why do we have to care about the gazes of others? If you want to kill someone, just go ahead and kill!”

“A mere brat dares to talk about killing me? I’ll slaughter you first!” Jin Jue’s face had turned red. Not only did Lin Yun kill the Nether Divinity Realm Son, but he even declared that he would kill him in the future. So Feng Jue’s reply was the last factor that triggered him to make a move against Lin Yun once more.

Multiple dragons appeared behind Elder Jin Jue, which was greater than what Lin Yun and the Imperial Feather Realm Son had created. Every single dragon looked vivid and seemed like they were fused with heaven and earth. They caused space to tremble as they moved.

Elder Jin Jue looked at Lin Yun and made the latter feel like he was trapped. But before the elder could attack, Luo Qingxu pushed his palm out and destroyed the dragons. Elder Jin Jue instantly threw up blood.

“Hmph, do you really think that I’m weak? You dare to make a move against a genius from the lower realm before me?!” Luo Qingxu slowly stood up from the ground. Everyone could see his face clearly and he looked as though he was the king of this entire region.

“Y-you made a breakthrough?” Elder Jin Jue’s eyes flashed with fear.

“That palm earlier was just a warning. If you’re not here to recruit anyone, you can get lost now.” Luo Qingxu’s eyes flashed with disdain. At this moment, the aura he emitted was terrifying.

Those who had reached the Samsara Edict Realm were known as kings. Chen Xun was surprised by Luo Qingxu as well. It seemed like he really underestimated the Sacred Alliance. No matter what, the Sacred Alliance was one of the oldest powerhouses in Kunlun Realm and couldn’t be provoked easily.

“Don’t assume that joining the Sword Sect will mean you’re safe. You’ve committed a great crime, and someone will come to deal with you!” Jin Jue’s face alternated between red and white before he left.

“Lin Yun, Feng Jue has already given you his answer. Now, are you willing to leave with the Sword Sect?” Luo Qingxu looked at Lin Yun with a gentle gaze. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“I’m willing,” replied Lin Yun. This made Feng Jue smile because he liked Lin Yun’s temper.
