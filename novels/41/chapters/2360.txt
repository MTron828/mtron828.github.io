Chapter 2361 - Great Boost In Strength

Seven days later, the flames engulfing Lin Yun exploded like a butterfly breaking out from its cocoon. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, a bell rang in the secret realm, ripples spreading out in the surrounding space.

Lin Yun had refined all twenty-three Flame Origin Pellets over the past seven days. He then soared to the sky before throwing a punch. As space exploded before him, it caused the entire secret realm to tremble once more.

“That was satisfying!” Lin Yun landed on the ground and felt that he was filled with power. With a thought, primordial aura rose from the saint energy ocean within his violet palace, with over ten thousand strands of it. They were usually fused with his saint energy, so one could also extract them. He fell into deep thoughts, looking at the primordial aura, and muttered, “The primordial aura is really magical.”

Thanks to the Flame Origin Pellet, Lin Yun’s cultivation reached the late phase of the seventh-stage Saint Lord, and he was only one step away from reaching the pinnacle. The boost in his cultivation was swift. He didn’t understand the primordial aura of others, but he could sense that he wasn’t simple. When he wanted to refine it again, even the two sword canons couldn’t accomplish it.

“It’s the primordial aura that was personally refined by the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity, so there’s no way I can refine it further.” Lin Yun recollected his thoughts and placed the reason on the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity. He then began performing the Sovereign Dragon Fist, “Let’s test my current cultivation here.”

“Damn it, it’s shaking again.” The robust deacon responsible for watching the array raised his head and saw a jade medal trembling again, and even the entire array became unstable.

“What’s he doing?” The plump deacon said unhappily.

“Should we tell him about it?” The robust deacon asked.

“Leave him be. Do you think that he can destroy this jade medal?” The plump deacon sneered with disdain.

After performing the Sovereign Dragon Fist, Lin Yun stopped with joy on his face. He laughed, “I only spent seven days! If I was in the Kunlun Realm, I might have needed to spend at least a year to reach the late phase in the seventh-stage Saint Lord.”

He could tell that the Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets had something to do with cultivation techniques from the names, so Lin Yun soon had an idea. He mainly practiced two sword canons now, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, which was at the ninth stage; and the Great Profound Sword Canon, which was at the seventh stage.

The Great Profound Sword Canon was somewhat troublesome because it was incomplete due to the destruction of the two peaks in the Sword Sect. So he was stuck unless he could mend it.

“Let’s go with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon first.” A light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes because he wanted to try to make a breakthrough with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. He took a few breaths to calm down before taking out a Divine Dragon Destiny Pellet.

In his violet palace, there was a saint energy sea with a fist-sized golden pill hovering above it. As he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, the golden dragon-phoenix sword aura rose from the saint energy ocean, shining brightly.

With the help of the Divine Dragon Destiny Pellet, Lin Yun’s cultivation speed with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon reached a terrifying height as more dragon-phoenix sword aura gushed out from the ocean of saint energy, forming into tens of thousands of swords that soared out from the ocean.

After two hours, the Divine Dragon Destiny Pellet had disappeared, which made Lin Yun feel a heartache, “So soon?”

The exhaustion of the Divine Dragon Destiny Pellet was satisfying, but it was quickly exhausted. Lin Yun thought of something, and he smiled, “Wait, why am I feeling heartache? That belonged to Shangguan Jue, not me! Hahaha!”

Eighteen hours later, the amount of dragon-phoenix sword aura above the saint energy ocean reached a hundred thousand, which was a terrifying sum. But he had also reached the limit, so it was time for him to make a breakthrough.

“Combine!” Lin Yun inwardly roared before the dragon-phoenix saint aura merged left and right, slowly taking the firm of a Heavenly Dragon and a Divine Phoenix. But Lin Yun was patient and didn’t rush it. Not long after, the saint energy ocean began to bellow with waves when the Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix were formed. They were purely formed with sword aura, but they looked vivid, as though they were alive.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he knew he had reached the tenth stage in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. Reaching for his chest, the Flower Burial Sword flew out.

“Heavenly Dragon!” The Heavenly Dragon Sword Spirit in the violet palace coiled around the Flower Burial sword. Seeing this, Lin Yun was puzzled, “Mhm?”

When the Heavenly Dragon Sword Spirit coiled around the sword, flames began to ignite on the sword, creating a blaze that seemed like it could incinerate everything in the world. Seeing this, Lin Yun’s heart trembled and felt fearful of it.

“The Heavenly Dragon Sacred Flame? Why is it even more terrifying than the Great Solar Sacred Flame?” Lin Yun muttered as the scorching aura released by the sword made him feel suffocating. When he swung the sword at his left hand, his saint energy felt that his life was threatened, and it wanted to come out to protect him.

But it was too late because the saint origin was burnt through by the Heavenly Dragon Sacred Flame, leaving only bones behind in his left hand.

“Holy shit...” The pain made Lin Yun’s lip twitch, and he was shocked. “I can even hurt myself with the Heavenly Dragon Sacred Flame?”

He was lucky that he responded quickly, or the consequences might have been dire. While being shocked, his hand began to regenerate under the Blue Dragon Bone.

“Divine Phoenix!” Lin Yun recalled the Heavenly Dragon Sword Spirit and summoned the Divine Phoenix Sword Spirit. A cry resounded as the divine phoenix coiled around the sword, releasing a bizarre flame.

“Divine Phoenix Sacred Flame!” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up after he finally understood what was happening. After reaching the tenth stage with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, he didn’t just obtain two sword spirits, but also strengthened his attainment of sword dao. The two sword spirits turned into sacred flames of different attributes.

“Heavenly Dragon as Yang and Divine Phoenix as Yin...” Lin Yun muttered, suddenly stopping with his facial expression becoming grave. Wasn’t this a coincidence? He was just wondering how to balance the flames of the Flaming Yin-Yang Painting.

He stowed the Flower Burial Sword and took out the golden jade slip, observing the Flaming Yin-Yang Painting again. When he looked at it carefully, he obtained more information this time.

He lowered the jade slip an hour later. The Flaming Yin-Yang Painting was a secret technique consisting of offence and defense, and he could even grasp Yin-Yang Dao upon reaching a high level.

"Yin-Yang gives birth to dualism, dualism gives birth to the four symbols, the four symbols give birth to the eight trigrams, and the eight trigrams give birth to a world." Lin Yun’s face changed as he recited the information he had received. Dualism was Yin and Yang, corresponding with the Heavenly Dragon Sacred Flame and Divine Phoenix Sacred Flame.

Lin Yun slowly walked around in the secret realm with the golden jade slip, but he didn’t try using it. He was pondering about the profundity of this jade slip, before he suddenly stopped a few minutes later, “That’s mostly it.”

When he clasped his hands together, he formed the Yin-Yang Saint Seal with the two sword spirits leaving his body. Under his control, the two sword spirits began to chase after each other. He slowly controlled them; however, it didn’t feel smooth at first. But soon after, he formed a perfect circle with the two sword spirits.

“Condense!” Lin Yun roared as the two sword spirits ignited. In a split second, all the flames were devoured as though it was a painting.

Lin Yun dismissed the seal and took a few steps back, looking at the flames in the painting still chasing each other, forming a balance.

“I’m a fucking genius!” Lin Yun smiled with his brow raised and wore a bright smile. If the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity was here, he would be shocked by Lin Yun’s talent.

“Next are the four symbols, eight trigrams, and the world.” Lin Yun waved his hand and dismissed the painting, summoning the two sword spirits back into his body.

“Dragon-Phoenix Clone Art!” When the two sword spirits returned to him, Lin Yun turned around and divided himself into two. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Heavenly Dragon!”

“Divine Phoenix!” They both wielded the Flower Burial Sword and released flames of different attributes, and they swung a sword at each other. When the two swords clashed, dazzling flames illuminated the entire secret realm before Lin Yun saw a handsome man standing before him.

“What a handsome man.” Lin Yun couldn’t help praising before he realized that it was himself.

The two Lin Yuns began laughing as they merged once more. Lin Yun couldn’t conceal his excitement as the boost in his strength was unimaginable, not to mention that he still had the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet, which he planned to wait till he saw Profound Sky Venerable.

“Let’s give my Sovereign Constellation a try...” Lin Yun smiled and wanted to test the other trump card.

In the outside world, the robust deacon looked at the trembling medal with a grave expression but had no idea what was happening. The medal representing Flower Burial had been shaking, which made him feel uneasy.

“What is he trying to do? Is he trying to blow up the secret realm?” The plump deacon had a fiery temper and was furious, planning to give Lin Yun a warning.

But before he could even leave, the jade medal exploded, frightening the two deacons. When they came to their senses, they quickly retreated as they cursed, “Holy fuck!”
