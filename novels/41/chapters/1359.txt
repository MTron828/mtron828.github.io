Chapter 1360 - I Am Lin Yun

Lin Yun turned around and could see the entire sky spinning as the sea raged. The entire Profound Wither Island was finally crumbling

“Lin Yun, don’t go. It’s too dangerous!” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the sword box with her tone filled with concern. The restriction that was left behind by the Profound Wither Great Saint was beginning to crumble, making the space around it violently fluctuate. As for the Profound Wither Island, it naturally fell into chaos.

“I have to find Tang Jing’s corpse no matter what,” said Lin Yun with a grave expression. “At least, I have to try.”

He could understand what Luo Shuyi was feeling, and this was why he wanted to help her. It was so much so that he would do it even if Luo Shuyi didn’t ask him for help. As the Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him, he carefully travelled around the shattering dimension.

Just like that, Lin Yun shuttled through the rubble. If he remembered correctly, Tang Jing’s corpse shouldn’t have been far from the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda. As long as he could find the pagoda, he should be able to find Tang Jing’s corpse. But it wasn’t easy. The entire Profound Wither Island was collapsing with rubble floating in the surroundings.

Not only was his vision being hindered, but the surrounding space was also in chaos. When Lin Yun sat on a huge rock, he could sense a surge of danger with his sword intent and quickly shifted away. In the next moment, space began to crumble on the huge rubble he previously stood on. But before he could catch his breath, the shattering space turned into a violent storm that swept out.

The surrounding space was being sucked into the storm and disappeared in the blink of an eye. As for Lin Yun, he was like a bird flying in the violent storm, and he had pushed the Divine Sunchasing Art to the limit. But even so, he was still very careful, feeling like he had experienced a hundred years, and each breath he took might be his last.

“Lightning Shadow Sword!” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up a long time later when he saw the Lightning Shadow Sword that was plunged into a huge rock. He nearly forgot about it and Jian Tiantian would probably kill him if he lost it. After a few flickers, Lin Yun landed on the huge rock and pulled the Lightning Shadow Sword out.

“Lin Yun, look over there!” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded.

When Lin Yun looked to the left, his eyes flashed. He found the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda. Perhaps because of the pagoda, the surrounding ground had yet to completely collapse.

When Lin Yun swept his glance out, many rocks were swept over by a storm that appeared before him. Each huge rock contained a terrifying power and looked like a stone dragon.

“Break!” Lin Yun roared as he swung out the Lightning Shadow Sword. With his firmament sword intent empowering the sword, the runes on the Lightning Shadow Sword shone brightly and the rocks were severed into two.

Stomping his foot on the ground, the huge rock beneath his foot broke apart and Lin Yun soared to the sky, passing through the gaps that he had created with the Lightning Shadow Sword and landed on the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda.

He discovered that there was someone still alive. When he turned his head over, he realized that it was Qin Cang. He was still alive, relying on his instincts to slowly crawl on the ground with great difficulty.

When Qin Cang heard the commotion that Lin Yun had created, he yelled, “Are you Martial Uncle? Save me, I’m Qin Cang! Since I’m still alive, I will definitely rise in the future. I will also repay the humiliation that Lin Yun gave me a hundred-fold! When I reach the Dragon Pulse Realm, I will pay him back! I, Qin Cang, will definitely not die here. Bring me with you, I want to seek the Saint Sovereign for forgiveness because I have betrayed his trust. Bring me back, I’m not a cripple. As long as I still have a breath left, I will definitely rise up again! So don’t leave me behind!”

Looking at Qin Cang crawling to his feet, Lin Yun merely looked at the former without any expression on his face. Qin Cang was already in this state, but he still wanted to take revenge. This made Lin Yun realize that Qin Cang had no regrets about what he had done.

“Why aren’t you speaking? Do you think that I’m a cripple? Since I can rise in the Nether Divinity Clan as the son of a concubine, I will definitely be able to do it again! Bring me back! I don’t want to die here! I want to see Saint Sovereign! I want to take revenge against Lin Yun, so please, bring me back!” Qin Cang sobbed while he grabbed onto Lin Yun’s feet with his remaining arm.

But right at that moment, a familiar voice resounded, “I am Lin Yun.”

Those four words resounded within Qin Cang’s ears and was instantly him dumbfounded. He quickly let go of Lin Yun’s feet and quickly backed away. But Lin Yun couldn’t even be bothered to take a look at him. When three thousand dragon runes gathered to his feet, he gave Qin Cang a kick, “Get lost!”

Just like that, Qin Cang shot out like a cannonball and was sent flying away, leaving this region that could still be considered safe. Lin Yun said that he wouldn’t kill Qin Cang, but Qin Cang was simply too disgusting for him to look at. He had made up his mind that he would kill Qin Cang with a stomp if he couldn’t find Tang Jing’s corpse.

Following his memory, Lin Yun continued forth and it didn’t take long for him to see Tang Jing’s corpse. Tang Jing died a horrible death when he was killed by Qin Cang after he spoke a sentence. Even in his death, he couldn’t protect Luo Shuyi from being disfigured. Lin Yun wasn’t a heartless person. On the contrary, he was a person filled with warmth and affection.

“Wait!” Just when Lin Yun was about to step forth, a voice resounded from the sword box.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Yun asked.

“Don’t move. There’s someone over there! That person is here again!” Lil’ Purple said anxiously and this tone of her’s was rare.

When Lin Yun raised his head and focused his firmament sword intent in his eyes, he couldn’t say anything. There was no one aside from Tang Jing. But suddenly, he could feel a chill down his spine and the Lightning Shadow Sword in his hand also began to tremble. This instantly made Lin Yun’s face change as he took several steps back.

Yu Qingfeng was standing beside Tang Jing. He raised his head to look at Lin Yun, who had arrived. Looking at Lin Yun retreating figure, he smiled before his gaze fell onto Tang Jing once more, “It’s this young lad again.

“Is he that old fellow’s grandson? He really died a terrible death. Uh, but at least his aura hasn’t dissipated yet, so he should still have a chance.” Yu Qingfeng lifted Tang Jing’s corpse and flew towards the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

This scene left Lin Yun shocked as he looked at Tang Jing’s corpse that suddenly flew into the air and entered the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda.

Right at that moment, the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda released a rainbow light that distorted space before Tang Jing disappeared. This made Lin Yun feel a chill down his spine and finally believed what Lil’ Purple said before that there was someone else there.

“Is it that person who came when I was refining the Great Saint Origin?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s him. You should know about him because you’ve heard of him before,” said Lil’ Purple.

What Lil’ Purple said left him dumbfounded. He then asked, “Who?”

“The Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng!”

Lin Yun’s heart sank when he heard that. This wasn’t the first time he had heard that name. That name was resounding, and was practically a legend. He then asked, “Why did he take Tang Jing away with him?”

“Perhaps he has a way to save Tang Jing,” said Lil’ Purple.

“The dead can come to life?” Lin Yun asked in a shocked tone.

“Of course not,” said Lil’ Purple. “But the death that you know of might not be death in the eyes of many. Tang Jing’s neck is broken, but his body hasn’t completely died, at least not his heart. As for his soul, it’s definitely still around because it hasn’t been long.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun rejoiced, “Tang Jing can still be saved?”

“It might be hard for many people. At least divine elixirs are needed. But since Yu Qingfeng has made a move, he should be pretty confident about it. After all, the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda was left behind by the Profound Wither Great Saint. Don’t forget what the Profound Wither Great Saint is proficient at,” said Lil’ Purple.

“Life-death dao! You’re talking about the life-death dao!” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he heard that. This also made Lin Yun let out a breath of relief that Tang Jing could be saved. This also meant that Luo Shuyi wouldn’t be that sad.

“The Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng isn’t the same as the legend,” muttered Lin Yun. After all, the Sword Emperor was someone who sliced two peaks from the Sword Sect, allowing the strongest Sword Sect to become the Ancient Barren Domain’s Sword Sect. He initially thought that someone of that caliber would be domineering and view the lives of others as mere ants. He never expected that the Sword Emperor would actually pay attention to the life and death of a small figure.

“It’s true that he doesn’t have any ill intentions. But you can’t just look at things on the surface because the Profound Wither Great Saint had his guard up against the Sword Emperor,” said Lil’ Purple once more.

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun had a feeling that he had missed out on something important.

“Do you still remember when the Profound Wither Great Saint said that he didn’t know where the Southern Emperor’s tomb was located?”

“I do.”

“Then you should remember that he said that you will be able to find the Southern Emperor’s real tomb one day. Do you remember that the Southern Emperor is buried together with his wife?”

“Of course I do,” said Lin Yun before his face drastically changed because he finally knew what he had missed.

“Do you understand now?” Lil’ Purple asked. “Since the Profound Wither Great Saint said that he doesn’t know where the Southern Emperor’s real tomb is located, how will he know that the Southern Emperor is buried together with his wife? He said that the Profound Wither Key is a container, but I feel that it might be involved with where the Southern Emperor’s tomb is located. I believe that you’ll know if I’m right after you undo the nine restrictions.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered before he said, “So the Profound Wither Great Saint didn’t tell me because of the Sword Emperor’s existence?”

“That’s only a speculation. The Sword Emperor shouldn’t have any ill intentions, and the Profound Wither Great Saint might also not know where the Southern Emperor’s tomb is located. I overheard that the Profound Wither Great Saint owed the Sword Emperor one, and the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda was a repayment.”

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because he had no idea about the connections. Right at that moment, a sword vibration echoed as a sword ray pierced through the layers of vortexes before a figure landed beside Lin Yun.

“Why are you standing here? Quick, leave!” It was Feng Jue who came for Lin Yun.

“I…” Lin Yun replied.

But before he could finish, Feng Jue interrupted him and raged, “You’re really reckless. Why are you still staying here if you can’t find Tang Jing’s corpse? What’s the matter? You want me to collect your corpse? Leave with me now or I’ll break your legs!”

Lin Yun was startled by those words because he had never seen Feng Jue so furious. At the same time, he didn’t doubt that Feng Jue would really break his legs. After all, his legs could still be healed after being broken.

Right at that moment, a group of people holding onto the Profound Sky Umbrella entered and landed beside Qin Cang, who still had a breath left.

This made Feng Jue wear a grave expression before he sighed, “You’re really in deep trouble now.”

After he was done, he grabbed onto Lin Yun’s shoulder and flew out of the Profound Wither Island.
