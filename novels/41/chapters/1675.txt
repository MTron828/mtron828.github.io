Chapter 1676 – Battle On The Lake

When Mo Ling’er brought him into the pavilion and pulled up the veil, the one seated in the pavilion was An Liuyan. She had disguised herself as a man, but her voice was still gentle as she said, “Sit.”

After Lin Yun pulled a chair over and casually sat down, An Liuyan examined Lin Yun. She said, “To have such deep and unfathomable cultivation at such a young age, you probably have a huge origin.”

“Boss An, you’re being too polite. I’m afraid that your cultivation is the one that’s not simple.” Lin Yun replied. Her huge harvest at the Ancient Barren Battlefield gave her many benefits in the Demon Gate. Thus, it was natural for her cultivation to surpass those in the same generation, not to mention that she also had the White Dragon Bone and a prominent background. The resources she wielded far exceed his imagination, and he would be thrown behind by comparing their wealth alone. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

An Liuyan smiled, but her eyes flashed with a peculiar light as she asked, “I shouldn’t have revealed my surname to you, right?”

Her words made Lin Yun’s heart jump as he wondered if he had revealed himself.

An Liuyan inwardly snickered and was even more confident that this person was from the Blood Moon Sect. But she didn’t dwell on it and asked, “Young Master, how can I address you?”

“Lin.” Lin Yun replied.

“Young Master Lin is here to buy the petals of the Heavenly Snow Lotus? How much do you need?” An Liuyan asked.

“As many as you have.” Lin Yun replied.

His words made Mo Ling’er and An Liuyan exchange a glance with shock in their pupils. She asked, “Do you know the value of the Heavenly Snow Lotus? Can you even afford it?”

Pondering over what An Liuyan said, Lin Yun instantly became uncertain. He might have many saint elixirs, artifacts, and Divine Astral Pellets. But those were from the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and An Liuyan would definitely be able to recognize them.

After a brief pondering, he still took out a myriad year saint elixir. This elixir wasn’t obtained from the Blue Dragon Palace, and An Liuyan shouldn’t know that he possessed it.

“Blood Dragon Ginseng!” An Liuyan and Mo Ling’er exclaimed, recognizing this saint elixir.

“That’s right. This is a myriad year Blood Dragon Ginseng, and it even has a rare Yin-Fire attribute. It can easily be sold for tens of millions of Divine Astral Pellets, which should be enough. It can even be sold for over a hundred million to those who need it urgently.” Lin Yun continued. “If Boss An still doubts I can afford it, I can prove my wealth with Divine Astral Pellets.”

An Liuyan briefly examined the Blood Dragon Ginseng before raising her head to look at Lin Yun. But she was disappointed because Lin Yun wore a mask, and she couldn’t find anything more about him. She could only sense that Lin Yun was young, and his cultivation wasn’t low.

Most importantly, this person’s gaze was evident when he looked at her, which was really weird. She might have disguised herself as a man, but her charm wasn’t something that ordinary people could resist. Even if he could, he shouldn’t dare to look her in the eyes. Has everyone in the Blood Moon Sect become gentlemen? To take out a myriad year saint elixir easily, just who was he? Why did this person share a slight resemblance with ‘that’ person?

Thus, she decided to probe him. With a smile, she walked over and bent down, “Young Master Lin, I’m afraid you probably don’t know much about the Heavenly Snow Lotus. It’s not something that I can sell if I want to, as there are many rules in the sect.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun replied. “How can I buy it, then?”

“Young Master Lin, do you think I’m beautiful?” An Liuyan raised her head, and her pupils were filled with boundless charm.

Lin Yun nearly fell for her charm back then, not to mention that her cultivation had increased. While Lin Yun was being cautious, a hand reached out. Mo Ling’er reached out towards the Blood Dragon Ginseng, seeing that Lin Yun was being distracted. But Lin Yun was faster than her and quickly took back the Blood Dragon Ginseng.

Just when he was about to retreat, An Liuyan took this opportunity to fall into his embrace. But he was decisive and shattered the chair before he swiftly fled. When he stood firmly on the ground, he immediately sensed something wasn’t right and realized that the Silver Moon mask was missing.

When he raised his head, he saw An Liuyan holding onto the Silver Moon Mask, and she smiled, “I’m just curious about Young Master Lin’s appearance.”

But when she turned around and saw Lin Yun’s face, she was briefly stunned because this person wasn’t Lin Yun. This was a completely unfamiliar face, and his temperament wasn’t the same. When she came to her senses, her face became cold.

“Young Master Lin, you really look unfamiliar.” An Liuyan said coldly. Since this person wasn’t Lin Yun, there was no need for her to continue to be polite. But it was also good that this person wasn’t Lin Yun, or it would’ve been hurtful if he had fled when she was falling into his embrace. She was confident that she was a beauty, possessing both beauty and figure, not to mention that her charm made her even more bewitching.

“There’s no need for you to know who I am, and what you’ve done earlier is a little too much. Since you’re not selling the Heavenly Snow Lotus, I’ll take my leave, then. Can you return my mask to me now?” Lin Yun said indifferently.

He couldn’t reveal his identity to An Liuyan with the current situation. If possible, he didn’t want to cause anyone any trouble.

“Ha, you think you can leave?” An Liuyan sneered.

Four maids flew over from four directions. Each maid was at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. When they drew their swords, the aura that they gave off wasn’t weak at all. They were professional assassins trained by the Heavenly Star Pavilion.

This made Lin Yun furrow his brows because the situation seemed to have gone out of hand.

“Boss An, what do you mean?” Lin Yun asked.

“Is there still a need for you to pretend to be a fool? Heavenly Snow Lotuses are extremely rare and are mostly not for sale. So are you not trying to create trouble by coming here to buy one? Speak, which saint servant are you?!” An Liuyan said coldly.

Lin Yun instantly realized that there was a misunderstanding. Just when he wanted to explain, a wisp of ancient aura flew towards the few maids. He immediately opened his mouth, “Watch out!”

Just when An Liuyan was about to mock, a blood mark appeared in the eyes of the four servants, and they charged towards her. The four maids executed their ultimate attacks and even brought out their constellations, pushing their strength to the limit.

“Missy!” Mo Ling’er’s face changed, and she quickly stood before An Liuyan, blocking the incoming attacks on behalf of her. As they fought in the pavilion, Lin Yun took several steps forth and poured a cup of tea for himself.

“This fellow! I’ll deal with you later!” An Liuyan glared at Lin Yun before she roared, “Who is it?! Show yourself!”

“Haha! I heard that a Nine-Star Demon Venerable from the Demon Gate would come to the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. But you don’t look anything impressive after all.” A piercing laughter echoed. The two lakes exploded, and two figures appeared.

A man and woman appeared. The man donned a grey robe, and the woman donned a red robe.

An Liuyan flew out and stood on the pavilion, coldly looking at them, “Fang Yan, Zhang Ying, you two dogs from the Blood Moon Elysium dare to kill me?”

The Blood Moon Elysium was a subsidiary force of the Blood Moon Sect, equivalent to the relationship between the Heavenly Star Pavilion and Demon Gate.

“If we capture you, I’ll naturally be able to enter the Blood Moon Sect. I’m afraid it’ll be interesting to send a beauty like you into the divine sect.” Zhang Ying licked his lips and examined An Liuyan with flames blazing in his pupils. He didn’t bother concealing the lust in his pupils at all. An Liuyan was a beauty, more bewitching than Fang Yan, and he had decided to taste An Liuyan before giving her away.

“I heard Boss An practices the Heavenly Demon Canon and is proficient in charming techniques. It looks like it’s lacking when compared to the canon of my divine sect.” The woman, Fang Yan, smiled. She was the one who controlled the four women.

“Is that so?” An Liuyan snorted and knocked her fan on her palm. When petals began to appear in her pupils, they were dragged into an illusion before the two could react.

Fang Yan and Zhang Ying looked around, noticing that they were in an illusion created with multiple intertwining fans. There was an An Liuyan on each fan, and An Liuyan was as bewitching as a deity, exuding unimaginable charm.

“Not good!” The two’s faces changed, and they quickly moved, wanting to destroy the illusion.

But this illusion was something that even Qin Tian had difficulty breaking. So they couldn't destroy it anytime soon, and it didn’t take long for them to be restricted by An Liuyan.

“Since you two want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish, then!” An Liuyan snorted. Just when she wanted to deal a fatal blow, a scream resounded from outside the illusion. It came from Mo Ling’er.

An Liuyan fanned her blade to send the two back before she left the illusion and saw four maids lying on the ground. As for Mo Ling’er, she laid beside Lin Yun, and there was a figure in the lake. This person was donned in a black robe with faint ripples on the lake, and he held a cold spear. He was the Blood Moon Elysium’s Ma Qing, with cultivation at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

Even though the Blood Moon Elysium’s younger generation intruded on the Heavenly Star Pavilion’s territory, the Heavenly Star Pavilion’s elders were being held down. She knew she was careless, and she shouldn’t have stayed here. The Heavenly Star Pavilion’s force in the Skyflowing Island was too weak, and she had to reach the main branch in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea as soon as possible.

But this had ended, and it was futile, even if she regretted it now. Her heart sank, and she felt a chill run down her spine while thinking about her outcome after being captured by the Blood Moon Sect.

“An Liuyan, leave with us!” Ma Qing said coldly. “Don’t bother escaping. The other Heavenly Star Pavilion’s elders are being restrained, and it’s too late for the experts from the other elders to rush over.”
