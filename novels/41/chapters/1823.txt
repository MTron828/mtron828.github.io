Chapter 1824 - Kill Them All!

“What a coincidence. I didn’t expect to run into Brother Lin so quickly.” Yu Wenxiu squinted his pupils, greeting Lin Yun like he was greeting an old friend.

Lin Yun knew that this person was difficult to deal with, so he smiled, “Indeed, what a coincidence. There’s only this Black Tortoise Core, and yet we actually ran into it at the same time. I wonder how Brother Yu wishes to divide it?”

“It’s just a Black Tortoise Core. So Brother Lin can go ahead and take it if you want.” Yu Weixiu smiled. But he briefly paused before he continued, “If you can.”

“Let me give it a try, then.” Lin Yun ignored Yu Wenxiu’s tone, and he dashed towards the Black Tortoise Core once more.

“Lin Xiao, you’re really arrogant! Are you courting death?!” Huang Xuanyi roared behind Yu Wenxiu, before he dashed forth with five Ming Cult’s disciples. They all emitted a powerful aura, and even summoned their constellations while charging towards Lin Yun.

“You guys think I’m not around?” A cold light flashed through An Liuyan’s pupils. The moment Huang Xuanyi’s group moved, she opened the fan in her hand and tossed it out. Mei Zihua also didn’t hesitate to join the battle, stopping the incoming six with An Liuyan.

Just when the Ming Cult’s six disciples were stopped, Lin Yun came before the Black Tortoise Core and reached out to grab it. But the moment he grabbed onto the Black Tortoise Core, he could immediately sense that something wasn’t right before lightning poured from the core into his body through his palm.

For an instant, Lin Yun’s right hand became numb, and the lightning energy wreaked havoc within his body. At this moment, the Black Tortoise Core became a bomb that couldn’t be shaken off, and he knew he had fallen for it.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

When Lin Yun came to his senses, Yu Wenxiu dashed over with murderous intent filling his pupils. Lin Yun wanted the Black Tortoise Core, but Yu Wenxiu wanted to take this opportunity to take his life.

“How does it feel?” Yu Wenxiu smiled, dashing towards Lin Yun.

One of Lin Yun’s hands was held up, and it was hard for him to get rid of the Black Tortoise Core. Taking this opportunity, Yu Wenxiu unleashed a barrage of attacks on Lin Yun, clashing with the golden-purple dragon runes on his body.

When a terrifying power swept out, it caused a splash in the lightning pool. Each of Yu Wenxiu’s attacks were fatal, but Lin Yun didn’t face him head-on. He only avoided his vitals being hit before resisting him with the Azure Dragon Saint Physique.

Lin Yun calmly faced this situation and executed the Azure Dragon Grasp. When a lightning vortex appeared on his palm, he began to rapidly refine this Black Tortoise Core. Others would need half a day to refine the Black Tortoise Core, but it was different for Lin Yun. He had the Azure Dragon Saint Physique that could enhance the refinery speed of the Black Tortoise Core, not to mention the Blue Dragon Saint Physique could digest the lightning. So he could just swiftly refine it without any reservations.

Ten-odd moves later, a wave appeared on the pool, and lightning began to crackle in the surrounding space.

“Sun and Moon Union!” Yu Wenxiu’s dragon origin manifested into a sun and a moon phenomenon in his palm. When he clenched his fist, the sun and moon converged into a ‘Ming’ word. His punch landed on Lin Yun’s chest, causing the hundred thousand dragon runes to shatter.

Seeing this, Yu Wenxiu sneered, pulling his right hand back. He was accumulating his energy before an ancient radiance shone out from him and unleashed an even more terrifying punch than before.

But at the critical moment, Lin Yun thrust his fingers towards Yu Wenxiu, using the hand he had grabbed the Black Tortoise Core with. This caught Yu Wenxiu by surprise, and he was sent flying away with the ‘Ming’ word behind him crumbling.

When Yu Wenxiu threw out a mouthful of blood, he looked at Lin Yun’s right hand with disbelief. He exclaimed, “How is this possible?!”

Lin Yun had refined a Black Tortoise Core so quickly, and he wasn’t prepared for Lin Yun’s attack at all.

“Senior Brother!” Huang Xuanyi and the other disciples quickly came over.

An Liuyan and Mei Zihua also retreated beside Lin Yun, and their face were terrifyingly pale with blood dripping from their lips. Almost at the same time, Lin Yun and Yue Wenxiu both sat down on the pool to recover from their injuries with pellets.

Strictly speaking, Lin Yun’s injuries were more serious in comparison, especially after taking the Sun and Moon Union head-on. But Yu Wenxiu wasn’t any better because his injuries weren’t any lighter than Lin Yun's. Just like that, they both chose to heal their injuries, and the battle between them earlier was shocking.

A stick of incense later, Lin Yun and Yu Wenxiu opened their eyes. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, lightning crackled on the surface of his body. He had completely refined the Black Tortoise Core. His cultivation rapidly improved, and the golden-purple dragon runes on his body became increasingly dazzling.

“Brother Lin, that was impressive.” Yu Wenxiu smiled. He was calmly chatting, as if what happened earlier hadn’t happened.

“You’re not bad, either.” Lin Yun said, standing up. He fell for Yu Wenxiu’s trap earlier, and suffered for a long time afterwards. If he hadn’t refined the Black Tortoise Core in time, he would have suffered from it.

“Hahaha, as expected of the Nirvana Banquet’s champion. I already guessed that you must have your confidence for entering the Black Tortoise Void Sea while being at the Dragon Pulse Realm. Your Heavenly Dome Sword Intent has reached greater mastery?” Yu Wenxiu said, probing with his eyes flickering.

“Why don’t you take a guess?” The corner of Lin Yun’s lips curled into a playful smile.

“Hahaha, it’s not that hard to guess.” Yu Wenxiu replied in a playful tone.

Tugging his arms together, Lin Yun said, “But you don’t dare. With your personality, you will want others to probe me and you won’t take the risk.”

There was no doubt the greater mastery of Heavenly Dome Sword Intent was strong. Even if there was a huge realm difference between them, there was a possibility that Lin Yun could kill him. The Heavenly Dome Sword Intent wasn’t something that could normally be grasped at the Dragon Pulse Realm, not to mention after reaching greater mastery in it.

To put it in a nutshell, Yu Wenxiu had a high chance of winning, but Lin Yun also had a chance to kill him at any moment.

Having guessed his intentions, Yu Wenxiu awkwardly smiled, “Brother Lin, you must be joking.”

While the two were talking in riddles, another Black Tortoise Core flew out from the pool. The appearance of this Black Tortoise Core naturally caused the surrounding atmosphere to tense up, but they still wore a ‘friendly’ smile when they looked at each other.

But before they could come to their senses, another Black Tortoise Core flew out from the pool. A brief moment later, more cores flew out. This time, Lin Yun and Yu Wenxiu could no longer maintain their expressions, and were both surprised. Anyone could guess that this pool wasn’t simple. There might be a sacred artifact down below.

A Black Tortoise Core represented the death of a Quasi-Saint. For there to be so many Black Tortoise Cores, they couldn’t imagine how heaven-defying the treasure at the bottom of the lake was, and this instantly made the Black Tortoise Core no longer precious in their eyes.

“It looks like this Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool isn’t simple. So many Quasi-Saints died, so they must have been protecting something when they were alive. Brother Lin, what do you think?” Yu Wenxiu asked.

“I share the same thoughts.” Lin Yun nodded.

Right then, three figures flew over and hovered above the Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool.

“Holy shit, so many Black Tortoise Cores?” An exclamation came out. The ones who arrived were Kou Tianhua, Yuan Hengying and Lady Stone. The exclamation earlier came from Yuan Hengying.

“Young Master, there must be a treasure at the bottom of the pool!” Lady Stone whispered.

“I know.” Kou Tianhua’s pupils were heated, but his face changed when he saw Lin Yun and Yu Wenxiu. His cultivation was the highest here, at the Fifth stage Profound Life Stage. But there was no way he could defeat the two parties. Even if he could win, he would probably have to pay a great price.

“Yu Wenxiu, there must be something special at the bottom of the pool. Why don’t we join hands and chase the irrelevant people away?” Kou Tianhua asked with a fake smile. He had considered it carefully. As long as Yu Wenxiu agrees with him, they would kill Lin Yun first before he kills Yu Wenxiu.

“You think that’s possible?” Yu Wenxiu asked. “Since you’re here, the others won’t be long. The phenomenon created by nine Black Tortoise Cores can be seen from a thousand miles away!”

When he finished, more people began to arrive. Not long later, there were over a hundred people gathered above the Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool, and their gazes became heated when they saw the nine Black Tortoise Cores. But no one dared to move because they knew Kou Tianhua and Yu Wenxiu weren’t easy to deal with, not to mention Lin Xiao was around.

“How unfortunate.” Kou Tianhua furrowed his brows with a hint of rage blazing across his pupils. There were too many people here. Even if he wanted to kill everyone here, he didn’t have that ability. But thinking of the possible treasure that might be below the lake, he declared in a cold voice, “Go for the Black Tortoise Cores first. If anyone dares to snatch them, kill them all!”
