Chapter 925 - Glorymoon Spirit

At this moment, heaven and earth were trembling violently. Cracks started to spread out on the mountain beneath Lin Yun as all life forms within a ten mile radius were incinerated.

“This is the power of the Divine Sun Breaking Seal?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with excitement. The destructive power was equal to the third form of the Three Heavenly Divides. As for the first two forms, they weren’t comparable unless he made a breakthrough in sword intent.

Most importantly, he had only learned the seal a moment ago, so it was far from lesser mastery. So the power would be incredible when the Divine Glorysun Fist eventually reached greater mastery. It was truly worthy of being called an advanced fortune martial technique.

“I still have a long way to go to perfect it…” Lin Yun held onto his chin and fell into deep thoughts. When he opened his hand, his origin energy gathered in his palm and formed an ancient golden seal.

There were many missing parts to the seal, but it had nine images that surrounded it. It looked like a few lesser seals were enveloping the main seal. If Lin Yun guessed correctly, the combination between the seals would create different phenomena. So the Divine Sun Breaking Seal was required to use the Divine Glorysun Fist and it was also the core of the technique.

From a certain degree, the grade of the Divine Sun Breaking Seal was related to the power of the fist technique. The nine lesser seals represented nine forms of the Divine Glorysun Fist and they would only light up if Lin Yun successfully cultivated the seal.

If he could light the third lesser seal, he could trigger the Divine Glorysun Fist’s secret technique, Divine Sun Annihilation. However, it was a forbidden technique that couldn’t be used carelessly.

According to the information from the Divine Glorysun Fist, it was extremely complicated to cultivate the Divine Sun Breaking Seal. If Lin Yun wanted to reach the pinnacle, he would have to refine a fire attributed beast core of the highest grade. Furthermore, it had to be a yang attribute beast core. It was also best if the demonic beast contained the ancient golden crow’s bloodline.

However, the thing that deterred many people was the fact that the beast core needed to come from a second soul Heavenly Soul Realm monarch demonic beast. After all, the demonic beasts in the Heavenly Path were terrifying and elite demonic beasts could easily suppress cultivators of the same realm.

Overlord demonic beasts could compete with geniuses from higher realms. As for monarch demonic beasts, they were so strong that even geniuses on the Azure Dragon Ranking would struggle against them. However, the issue was that monarch demonic beasts were difficult to find. At the very least, Lin Yun hadn’t heard any news about a monarch demonic beast in the Glorysun Land.

“I guess I have to head to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm soon.” Then, Lin Yun started to examine the map given to him by Chen Xuan.

The Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm was located in the core of the Azure Dragon Region. There was no doubt that the forbidden realm would be extremely dangerous, especially since the seven astral lands couldn’t compare to it.

Furthermore, Lin Yun might even run into those on the Azure Dragon Ranking, so the journey would be dangerous.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I can’t wait to see how strong the Azure Dragon Ranking is!” Lin Yun smiled and soared into the sky. When he landed on the ground, a demonic beast was standing in his way. Since he had already incinerated everything in a ten mile radius, the demonic beast that stood before him was strong.

Lin Yun was facing a second soul Heavenly Soul Realm Blackblood Demonic Wolf. This demonic beast was emitting an eerie black miasma as its crimson pupils stared at Lin Yun. Lin Yun probably destroyed its territory, otherwise it wouldn’t be waiting for him.

“Second soul Heavenly Soul Realm…” Lin Yun was surprised because he had yet to fight a demonic beast this powerful. It wouldn’t be easy for him to deal with the wolf without the Divine Sun Breaking Seal.

He hadn’t even reached the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, but he already ran into trouble. The Blackblood Demonic Wolf didn’t give Lin Yun any time to think and pounced towards him.

But just when Lin Yun was about to make his move, a crimson python dashed forward and clashed with the Blackblood Demonic Wolf. With the sounds of broken bones, the Blackblood Demonic Wolf was sent flying.

Lil’ Red had attacked the wolf with the Blood Viper Whip. The Blood Viper Whip was a lot stronger in Lil’ Red’s hands than it was when Chen An used it. The countless afterimages of the whip formed a dragon that lashed out on the Blackblood Demonic Wolf.

It didn’t take long for black blood to splash all over the ground. When the Blackblood Demonic Wolf let out a howl, it tucked its tail and ran. Lil’ Red saw this and put away its whip. Then, it took out the VOid Blade from its interspatial pouch and disappeared into thin air.

Reappearing, the Void Blade pierced the Blackblood Demonic Wolf’s throat. Lin Yun was shocked because he knew that he couldn’t compete with Lil’ Red without using his sword.

His current strength was at an awkward stage. If he could reach the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm, he could easily crush the Blackblood Demonic Wolf. However, without the breakthrough, he would need to use at least ten moves, which excluded the use of his sword.

Ten days. Lin Yun needed ten more days to reach the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm. He just hoped that nothing would happen within the next ten days.

As Lin Yun headed towards the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, the competition in the other astral lands had come to an end.

In the Glorymoon Land, the Glorymoon Spirit laid on the altar of a majestic hall. The Violetyang Realm’s Lin Zhen, Myriadlight Realm’s Qin Dong, and Blackflame Realm’s Bai Wujing were staring at the Glorymoon Spirit, not making a move.

There was naturally nothing to say about their strength since they could come this far. All of them were capable of entering the Azure Dragon Ranking soon, especially Bai Wujing who was known as the strongest outside of the Azure Dragon Ranking.

Lin Zhen and Qin Dong were nervous because they weren’t confident that they could defeat Bai Wujing even if they worked together. Bai Wujing was practically invincible after reaching the eleventh stage in the Blackflame Demonic Art.

As Bai Wujing slowly approached Lin Zhen and Qin Dong, he sneered, “You guys intend to form an alliance?”

Qin Dong smiled, “We can’t help it since we’re facing you. Even if news of our alliance gets out, no one will say anything about us ganging up on you.”

“Bai Wujing, we won’t be able to defeat you even if we work together. But you can’t beat us on your own either,” said Lin Zhen.

“And?” Bai Wujing snorted. “You think you guys can split the Glorymoon Spirit in two? If either of you touch the Glorymoon Spirit, I will kill you. I’d like to see which one of you dares to touch it!”

Lin Zhen and Qin Dong’s faces ugly turned sour because Bai Wujing was clearly disregarding the relationship between the higher realms.

However, neither of them thought that the relationship between higher realms should affect the ownership of the Glorymoon Spirit. They weren’t afraid of Bai Wujing, but they couldn’t face Bai Wujing by themselves.

“You’re pretty arrogant. You think no one dares to touch the Glorymoon Spirit?” A voice of contempt rang through the hall.

“Who is it?!” Bai Wujing, Lin Zhen, and Qin Dong started looking around to see where the voice came from. But while they were looking around, a black figure reached the altar directly and retrieved the Glorymoon Spirit.

“Who are you?” Bai Wujing, Lin Zhen, and Qin Dong’s eyes flickered because they didn’t recognize the newcomer.

“I’m the Profound Amber Realm’s Yu Haotian!” The black figure smiled as he reported his origin.

“And here I was wondering who you were, but you’re just an ant. You’re courting death!” Bai Wujing had been accumulating his origin energy while Yu Haotian reported his name and origin. So once his eyes were filled with disdain, he attacked.

The entire hall started to tremble as Bai Wujing’s origin energy practically tore the hall apart. However, Yu Haotian moved even faster.

A huge hole tore through Bai Wujing’s chest before anyone noticed Yu Haotian’s attack. Just like that, Bai Wujing flew out like an arrow and destroyed all of the walls in his path. In the end, no one could tell if he was alive or dead.

A purple moon rose behind Yu Haotian that sent a chill throughout the entire hall. Lin Zhen and Qin Dong’s faces changed as they retaliated. They could tell that their bodies would become stiff if they didn’t make a move. At that time, death would be their only outcome.

“A few ants want to shake a tree?” Yu Haotian sneered. When he clenched his fist, the purple moon hanging behind started to distort. Before Lin Zhen and Qin Dong could even react, their bodies were swiftly covered with a layer of frost.

“Advanced fortune martial technique!” Lin Zhen and Qin Dong’s faces changed when they sensed the aura pouring out of Yu Haotian.

“Die!” Yu Haotian laughed as he froze Lin Zhen and Qing Dong. Then, he punched them into a million pieces.

“The Divine Glorymoon Fist is really terrifying when I combine one seal with the Phaseless Demonic Art…” Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed with excitement as his seal dissipated. He could sense that Bai Wujing was running away right now, but he didn’t care anymore.

“Hehe. Since I come from the Indigomoon Elysium, I’m fated with the Divine Glorymoon Fist. It’s the perfect match. With fate on my side, the Glorymoon Spirit’s seal won’t be able to stop me!” Yu Haotian was excited from his large harvest.

His cultivation had already reached the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm and he would undergo his second tribulation any time. He was so powerful now that he didn’t even place the Glorymoon Spirit’s seal in his eyes. After Yu Haotian put away the Glorymoon Spirit, he started laughing, “Lin Yun, you have to come to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. Otherwise, it’ll be too boring. Hahaha!”
