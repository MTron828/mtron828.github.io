Chapter 1227 - Indigo Lightning Fairy

As snow flowers drifted down, lightning exploded out from Ye Ziling. It looked like she was standing on a purple lightning lotus in mid-air. The snow flowers in the air were fighting with the pressure released from Chu Tianhao. As lightning and flames exploded, the ten Azure Birds emitted sharp power.

When the Azure Birds dove down, Chu Tianhao’s face turned ugly. He could sense his aura being compressed, which prevented him from fully releasing his monarch aura. As a monarch, he was trapped in a cage that practically crippled his monarch aura.

When Ye Ziling fully released her greater sky sword intent, she charged toward Chu Tianhao. The two clashed together, unleashing terrifying power with their collision. The moment she made her move, she didn’t hold back. Violent astral energy filled the surroundings with lighting, flame, snow, flowers, and sword rays.

Chu Tianhao, who initially wanted to keep his trump card hidden, had no choice but to bring out his full strength. As the crowd watched, they had to admit that this was the most brilliant fight of the day. In fact, it was even more brilliant than Lin Yun’s fight with Zhang He the previous day. After all, Lin Yun had only used less than 50% of his strength yesterday.

“This… has senior sister always been this strong?” Feng Zhang was shocked.

“Why isn’t her Azure Bird the same as ours?” Liu Qingyan asked. Ye Ziling was also using the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, but her birds were clad in lightning armor. As the ten Azure Birds circled in the air, they formed a terrifying lightning aura that not even Chu Tianhao’s Suspend King Art in the twelfth stage could compete with.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes with surprise because he noticed that Ye Ziling had gotten stronger. This meant that Ye Ziling might’ve awakened a bit more of her bloodline. But there still seemed to be a huge power in her bloodline that was waiting to be excavated.

It made him certain that the old geezer didn’t have the Radiant Snow Saint Clan’s bloodline. Although Ye Ziling’s Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords had also reached the manifestation stage, it wasn’t the same as his.

This made Lin Yun exclaim at Ye Ziling’s comprehension. After all, it hadn’t been long since he gave her the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. But it was a pity that he couldn’t pass the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra to her as well.

The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra was recorded at the top of the Sword Saint Mountain, and only those who saw the stone monument could cultivate it. So there was no way Lin Yun could pass it to others.

As lightning and flames surged on the stage, they manifested into various demonic beasts. This scene made Chu Tianhao’s face turn ugly as he locked onto Ye Ziling figure before he charged forward with his spear. As his spear radiated with cold light, his monarch aura transformed into an alpha wolf. Behind the alpha wolf were countless wolves of a pack.

“Clouds Manifesting Dragon!” Ye Ziling turned around and the boundless lightning formed into a lightning cloud dragon that collided with Chu Tianhao’s spear. When the sword and spear collided, starlight surged from within Chu Tianhao’s body as he poured everything into his sword. With a huge collision, cracks appeared on the cloud dragon that soon tore a terrifying hole that leaked out petals.

This scene made Chu Tianhao’s eyes lit up as he soared into the sky and charged toward Ye Ziling. Just when his spear was about to reach Ye Ziling, the latter put her hands together and yelled, “Divine Lightning Shadow Art!”

Her tall figure landed on the snow like a feather and each of the flowers in the sky contained her lightning energy and sky sword intent.

Strangely, as soon as she landed, her figure disappeared and Chu Tianhao’s attack missed.

Chu Tianhao was baffled as he could vaguely see a white figure shuttling through the snow. Not only did Chu Tianhao fail to find Ye Ziling, but he had fallen into the illusion instead. His face turned dark as he released the twelfth stage of his Suspend King Art without any reservation. Then, he charged through the snow like a ferocious beast.

Chu Tianhao relied on his Suspend King Art to chase after Ye Ziling.

“Found you!” Chu Tianhao’s spear flew through the flowers towards a white figure. But when he hit the white figure, it broke into tiny pieces.

“It was fake?” Chu Tianhao’s face changed as he saw Ye Ziling in the snow donned in her purple dress wielding a sword in her hand. With starlight falling down, Chu Tianhao was captivated by Ye Ziling’s beauty.

It was the eleventh sword of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords—Emerald Stars!

Basking in the starlight, Ye Ziling charged out with her sword. Her sword radiated with starlight that sent Chu Tianhao flying and throwing up blood.

When everyone in the Profound Azure Prefecture saw that Chu Tianhao was injured, they held their breaths. Was the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect about to steal all five wins?

“Ye Ziling, you’re courting death!” Chu Tianhao roared as runes began to open up behind him. The runes were formed with blood and flames that created a painting. If one looked carefully, they would see the ancient word for King. It was constructed by corpses that gave it traces of death.

“Ancient Suspend King Seal!” Chu Tianhao roared as he released a terrifying blood light. Along with bizarre laughter, he swept his spear out. When the ancient word empowered his spear, it formed a skeleton hand that reached out towards the boundless snow and the Azure Birds.

In the next second, several Azure Birds let out a miserable cry before they were crushed by the skeleton's hand.

“Not good!” The faces of Jiang Lichen, Liu Qingyan, and Feng Zhang changed as they bounced up from their seats. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Chu Tianhao wore a sinister expression as he attacked because he knew that there was no path of return. This was his trump card. Even if he defeated Ye Ziling, it would be impossible for him to go for the hell challenge since he had exposed his greatest trump card.

“This woman is really annoying!” Chu Tianhao gritted his teeth. He was determined to cripple Ye Ziling even if the Suspend King Palace lost.

But facing his attack, there was no change on Ye Ziling’s face. The Radiant Snow Flower continued to burn in her pupils. At the same time, the mourning Azure Birds released a dazzling light as Ye Ziling raised her sword, executing the Twelfth Sword—Azure Mountain Beyond The Clouds!

When a boundless sea of clouds unfolded behind her, they were filled with lightning. When she stabbed her sword out, the sea of clouds and flowers formed a massive vortex that looked like they would devour all of the light.

When light returned after a split moment of darkness, the skeleton hand summoned by Chu Tianhao was covered with cracks before exploding.

“H-How is this possible?!” Chu Tianhao exclaimed with disbelief. Suddenly, he squinted his eyes, “The Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. How can you possibly learn the last three swords without reaching the summit of the Sword Saint Mountain?!”

“It has nothing to do with you,” said Ye Ziling indifferently before she swung her sword out. She instantly destroyed the skeleton before landing on Chu Tianhao’s chest, creating a huge explosion that pushed Chu Tianhao into the ground.

Chu Tianhao’s body was buried deep into the stage. The hole was incredibly deep and the impact made Chu Tianhao lose consciousness.

“Ye Ziling of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect wins!”

The plaza fell into a brief silence before everyone turned to look at Ye Ziling. At the same time, Ye Ziling vented all of her frustration from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect being looked down upon.
