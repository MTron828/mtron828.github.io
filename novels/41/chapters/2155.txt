Chapter 2156 - I’ll Let You Have Three Swords (2)

“Three-eyed dog, let me face you!” Cao Yang stepped out right at this moment. He was from the Ancient Vajra Monastery, cultivating the Vajra Golden Physique. Although his strength wasn’t on the first tier, he still wanted to give it a try.

Lin Yun was surprised by this scene, and he had a feeling that something wasn’t right with Cao Yang. When Cao Yang and Tian Gu fought, Cao Yang relied on the Vajra Golden Physique, planning to exchange injuries. He didn’t hope that he could defeat Tian Gu, and it would be good if he could inflict injuries on the latter.

But he wasn’t as strong as the Canaan Hall’s holy son, and there was nothing he could do about Tian Gu’s spatial secret technique. As a result, Tian Gu messed around with him.

It was fortunate that the Vajra Golden Physique was powerful enough. Just when Cao Yang was about to suffer heavy injuries, he immediately rolled down the dragon mountain.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Haha! Are there only clowns left amongst the Kunlun Realm’s geniuses?” Looking at the fleeing Cao Yang, Tian Gu burst into laughter with mockery filling his eyes.

“It’s time for us to go to the Heavenly Dragon Stage, so there’s no need for us to waste time here,” Gu Xinyu smiled beside Tian Gu as he appeared.

“Let’s go. It looks like I have overestimated the Kunlun Realm,” Tian Gu sneered with disdain.

“Let me face you, then!” Someone finally couldn’t watch any longer. This person was the champion of the Third Heavenly Path, Situ Yan.

“Come on, then.” Tian Gu was rather interested in Situ Yan.

But Gu Xinyu smiled instead, “You just underwent a battle earlier, so you should rest and let me fight this one, instead.”

“Okay.” Tian Gu smiled as he tugged his arms together to watch this battle. Anyone could tell that he was confident in Gu Xinyu’s strength.

Gu Xinyu said, “I heard that you practiced the Thousand Flame Saint Art, easily grasping ten different sacred flames at a young age. Why don’t you try and see if your sacred flames are capable of melting my Blood Moon Golden Physique?”

“You’re not going to retaliate?” Situ Yan squinted. It looked like Gu Xinyu was more arrogant than he had imagined.

“I won’t make a move before you use your full strength,” Gu Xinyu said arrogantly.

“You’re asking for it!” Situ Yan didn’t refuse, and he wasn’t a stubborn person. Since Gu Xinyu wasn’t planning to retaliate, this gave Situ Yan an opportunity to take him out.

When a dao flower bloomed behind Situ Yan, everyone saw that it contained Fire Dao with ten different sacred flames that began to appear. There was the Thousand Lightning Sacred Flame. Profound Radiance Sacred Flame, Coldfrost Sacred Flame… and the Blood Flame Sacred Flame.

Situ Yan mastered ten different sacred flames, and each sacred flame could easily melt saint artifacts. If the ten sacred flames overlapped together, even the Radiant Sword Saint wouldn’t be able to endure it.

Situ Yan was confident that even the Dao Yang Holy Son’s saint aura might not be able to withstand the combination of ten sacred flames. Normally, it would be hard for him to unleash all ten sacred flames and overlap them together since his opponents weren’t idiots, and they could avoid the incoming attack while Situ Yan took his time to brew his attack.

But because Gu Xinyu wanted to show off, this gave Situ Yan an opportunity, and the latter wouldn’t be polite with Gu Xinyu.

When the ten sacred flames fell onto Gu Xinyu, the ground beneath his feet turned into lava from the high temperature. The high temperature that radiated made everyone feel uncomfortable because the heat was unbearable.

But Gu Xinyu had no change on his face as he became enveloped in a crimson aura. No matter how high the sacred flames' temperature rose, the flames failed to inflict any injuries on him, and this scene startled everyone, leaving them dumbfounded.

“H… How is this possible?!” The Dao Yang Holy Son, who also practiced his physique, had his mouth wide open. After all, even he wasn’t confident about bearing the attack from so many sacred flames at once.

“It looks like this is your limit. Let me show you what a true sacred flame looks like!” Gu Xinyu spread his arms apart and a crimson moon bloomed like a lotus, instantly shattering the attack from the ten different sacred flames.

As a wisp of crimson flames ignited on Gu Xinyu's palm, the ancient blood flame gave off a dignified aura that looked like a noble deity, and Gu Xinyu wore a grave expression. At the core of the blood flames, it looked as though there was an ancient world with countless people worshipping the crimson moon.

The blood flame was formed from their faith, causing everything in the world to tremble before it. This was the legendary destructive sacred flame, the Red Lotus Karma Flame.

When Gu Xinyu pushed the Red Lotus Karma Flame forth, Situ Yan was sent flying away with terrifying crimson flames burning on his body, making Situ Yan let out a miserable scream.

This scene had shocked everyone with their hearts trembling because this was too terrifying. Situ Yan had been defeated, suffering a pathetic loss.

When Gu Xinyu stowed the Red Lotus Karma Flame, a cold smirk rose on his lips as he sneered.

No one dared to say anything about it because no one expected Gu Xinyu to possess the Red Lotus Karma Flame as well as his Blood Moon Golden Physique. At this moment, everyone finally realized how terrifying Gu Xinyu and Tian Gu were.

How were they going to protect the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position now?

“It looks like there’s nothing special about the Champions of the Heavenly Paths after all. They’re no different from trash.” Gu Xinyu looked at Situ Yan, who was struggling to get on his feet with mockery filling his eyes. The surroundings fell into silence since no one dared to refute it.

“Your victory isn’t that impressive either, relying on the help of external objects.” A radiant voice echoed as Lin Yun calmly looksd at Gu Xinyu.

Gu Xinyu looked at Lin Yun, and wore a playful smile, “I know you. You’re the genius swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect, known as the strongest swordsman prodigy in the past thousand years? Why don’t we have some fun, then? Don’t worry, we’ll just have some fun.”

“Don’t be in such a hurry to make a move and wait till you’re on the Heavenly Dragon Stage. Even if you manage to defeat him, you’ll still have to face other opponents after that.” Su Ziyao’s voice resounded in Lin Yun’s ear.

She was naturally referring to the seven divine dragon lords. There was no doubt that they would compete for the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position.

“I was thinking that way too, but there’s no need for that now since he dared to mock the Champions of the Heavenly Paths. Don’t forget that your man is also the Champion of a Heavenly Path!” Lin Yun replied, standing up before Su Ziyao could reply.

The Heavenly Dragon Lord’s position might be important, but so was the dignity as the champion of a Heavenly Path!

“I’ll let you have three moves. I won’t retaliate before you unleash your full strength. Let me experience the strength of the Holy Maiden Killer,” Gu Xinyu smiled, waving his hand at Lin Yun with mockery filling his eyes.
