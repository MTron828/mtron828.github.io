Chapter 2459 - Great Saint Realm

A dragon roar came from the Myriad Dragon Cauldron, followed by a dazzling golden ray that shot to the sky as the entire continent began to tremble along with the dragon roar.

“Hot! Hot!” Lin Yun could feel his body burning in the Myriad Dragon Cauldron. It felt as though it was magma that flowed through his veins, not blood. The pain was naturally intense as it was a transforming process that Lin Yun repeated countless times. He couldn’t remember how many times he repeated, whether it was a thousand or ten thousand. The pain had already numbed him.

Lin Yun was like a wild beast, charging around in the Myriad Dragon Cauldron, throwing punches around. He was trying to vent the endless power in his body because his body was burning like a sun. The seven-colored divine dragon saint liquid was already exhausted in the cauldron, and he was venting by instinct with golden flames blazing in his eyes.

“The growth is too excessive, and he’s still too young...but this is a path you have to take,” the Black Emperor said with a grave expression. When he looked ahead, a banging sound came from the Myriad Dragon Cauldron, passing through the cauldron and creating a powerful impact.

“ARGGGH!” Another roar echoed as the entire Myriad Dragon Cauldron began to blaze.

Lin Yun was engulfed in flames as he jumped from the Myriad Dragon Cauldron. He shone brightly, and the ground soon dried up with cracks. White mist also came from the rivers far away, and the river was evaporating rapidly. The nearby mountains were also enveloped in flames, and the dragons coiling around the cauldron bowed to him as though they were paying their respect to a king.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun’s consciousness was blurred, letting out a roar from the violent energy within his body. When Lin Yun let out a roar, a golden Heavenly Dragon’s soul appeared, unleashing a powerful aura that shattered all the dragons.

The Black Emperor wore a smile as he flicked his finger, unleashing a beam of light at Lin Yun. The massive power landed on Lin Yun but was incinerated to ashes by the flames on Lin Yun.

“You’re courting death!” Lin Yun roared furiously and charged at the Black Emperor.

The Black Emperor wore a smile and allowed Lin Yun to descend before charging at him; Lin Yun unleashed countless punches at the Black Emperor, unleashing a powerful shockwave that caused the ground in a ten thousand miles of radius to explode with rocks flying around.

As Lin Yun vented the power within his body, cracking sounds came from his bones as his cultivation increased along with his aura.

“Not enough.” The Black Emperor looked at Lin Yun with a hint of mockery and provocation.

This further enraged Lin Yun, who had lost his rationale, charging over again. Facing him, the Black Emperor calmly retreated, allowing Lin Yun’s attacks to land on him. He was punching back, allowing Lin Yun to vent out the power in his body and take another step further to fuse with the Heavenly Dragon Bone.

Ten minutes later, Lin Yun’s cultivation began to rise, reaching the Heaven Domain Stage of the Saint Sovereign Realm. But his cultivation didn’t stop there and continued to rise. The Heavenly Dragon’s aura he gave off grew stronger, and he shot out two golden beams from his eyes, slicing everything into pieces in its path.

Lin Yun stood on a huge rock and spread his arms, roaring at the sky. Cracking sounds also came from his body as he looked like an actual dragon that came to life.

“This is interesting now.” The Black Emperor’s eyes shone with a smile on his face.

Lin Yun dashed over in the blink of an eye, unleashing multiple attacks on the Black Emperor. Ten-odd moves later, the Black Emperor was sent flying with a kick.

“Shit, this is a little painful...” The Black Emperor smiled, rubbing his chest.

Followed by another roar, Lin Yun’s bones cracked as golden flames blazed on his back. When he soared to the sky, he looked like a divine dragon, locking onto the Black Emperor. Furthermore, Lin Yun’s cultivation was close to the pinnacle of the Saint Sovereign Realm.

“Time to teach him a lesson now.” The Black Emperor dashed over and started attacking Lin Yun. He was Lin Yun’s punching back a moment ago, but Lin Yun has become his punching bag now.

Lin Yun was like a hot iron being tempered with a hammer, fusing with the Heavenly Dragon Bone. A hundred moves later, Lin Yun flew out and smashed into a mountain before the rocks buried him.

When the Black Emperor came before the pile of rocks, Lin Yun flew out from it, and the aura he gave off also reached the pinnacle of the Saint Sovereign Realm.

“It won’t be easy to reach the Great Saint Realm...” The Black Emperor frowned. He could tell that Lin Yun still hadn’t digested the power of the Heavenly Dragon Bone; less than one-tenth of it was refined. But the Great Saint Realm’s bottleneck was too terrifying, and that power rampaged within his body, unable to calm down because it couldn’t be vented. This was the reason why Lin Yun went berserk.

“He has to reach the Great Saint Realm, or he’ll blow apart.” The Black Emperor’s face became grave, and he said, “Time to get serious.”

With a thought, the Black Emperor released his aura as a mythical emperor, causing half of this continent to tremble under the pressure.

The golden radiance that Lin Yun gave off also dimmed down under the Black Emperor’s aura. The sky was also covered with thunderclouds, suppressing the dragon aura that Lin Yun gave off.

The Heavenly Dragon’s soul was going berserk within Lin Yun’s body, and it looked at the Black Emperor furiously after being suppressed. An even more powerful dragon aura swept out as Lin Yun came before the Black Emperor in the next second. But when his attacks landed on the Black Emperor, it felt like he was attacking an ocean, causing waves and explosions, but the Black Emperor was unaffected.

As Lin Yun attacked, his aura rose and soon stopped at the Great Saint Realm’s bottleneck.

“I’ll let them experience the strength of a mythical emperor!” The Black Emperor clenched his fist with murderous intent surging from him. A destructive aura also appeared in his eyes as everything in the surroundings suddenly became a dead land.

When the Black Emperor clenched his fist, it felt like he grasped all the murderous intent with a black aura leaking from his fingers, spreading to a thousand miles away. When he threw his punch, Lin Yun suddenly disappeared as he was like a brick falling, his body penetrating the entire continent.

The secret realm began to shatter, with mountains and rivers collapsing. The Black Emperor’s punch had completely shattered this entire continent. Then again, such power couldn’t be achieved in Kunlun Realm because of heavenly dao. There were countless cultivators, sects, and dragon veins, making it impossible even for a Deity Realm expert to shatter the entire Kunlun Realm.

But no matter what, the Black Emperor’s punch was too powerful.

“I seemed to have exerted a little too much force. I didn’t kill him, right...?” The Black Emperor was lingering with fear after throwing the punch and quickly chased after Lin Yun.

“Holy shit...” The White Emperor and Lil’ Purple rushed over and were stumped when they saw this scene, unable to believe what they had seen.

“What is blacky trying to do? He didn’t lie to me and is actually a spy, right? He looks like he wants to kill someone...” The White Emperor’s face turned pale, and he wanted to chase after the Black Emperor to settle the score with him.

“Hold on.” Lil’ Purple dragged onto the White Emperor on the Iris Sword Box. She said, “Calm down and stay hidden for now.”

She was afraid that something might happen to Lin Yun, but she had a feeling that the Black Emperor wasn’t a spy because Lin Yun was alive.

As Lin Yun’s body descended, he smashed through the layers of heaven, descending to the ninth-layer of heaven. The Black Emperor also arrived and heaved in relief when he saw that Lin Yun was fine in a secret realm on heaven's ninth-layer.

“It looks like you’ve regained your rationale,” the Black Emperor said. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, a light flashed, and the flames that blazed previously had subsided. The aura he gave off also reached the first stage of the Great Saint Realm.

“Senior, that punch of yours nearly killed me,” Lin Yun smiled as he stood up.

“You still remember?” The Black Emperor smiled.

“I regained some consciousness earlier, but I still can’t control my body,” Lin Yun nodded.

“Let me take a look at you.” The Black Emperor didn’t dare to be careless and placed his hand on Lin Yun to sense his current condition with his eyes closed. There were still remnant energies of the Heavenly Dragon Bone and Heavenly Dragon’s soul within Lin Yun’s body, but it was slightly under control now.

“As I’ve expected, you should be safe now,” the Black Emperor heaved in relief.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly, “But I can’t fight. If I do, the energies within my body will go out of my control.”

“You’ll be fine after reaching the Immortal Stage of the Great Saint Realm, and I don’t have a good solution about it,” the Black Emperor replied.

Right then, Lil’ Purple and the White Emperor descended from the sky.

Glancing at them, the Black Emperor smiled, “Perhaps that sword box can help you restrain the energies in your body.”

“Scumbag, are you alright?” Lil’ Purple asked as she came over with the Iris Sword Box.

“I’m fine,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Stop messing around. Come and look at the new Iris Secret Realm,” Lil’ Purple dragged Lin Yun into the secret realm.

Outside the Iris Secret Realm, the White Emperor grumbled, “Blacky, you nearly scared me to death with your punch earlier.”

“He won’t die so easily with the Heavenly Dragon Bone and Heavenly Dragon’s soul. He has already achieved the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique, and an emperor would have to spend some effort to kill him,” the Black Emperor replied.

“Stop pretending. You were also scared earlier,” the White Emperor replied.

“It was a little too much, and I have to rush over to look at him,” the Black Emperor smiled. As the two chatted, Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple emerged from the Iris Secret Realm.

Wearing excitement on his face, Lin Yun looked at the Black Emperor and asked, “Senior, the Iris Secret Realm can really be comparable to a holy land, not to mention that it can also help me restrain the remnant energies of the Heavenly Dragon Bone and Heavenly Dragon’s soul.”

“I have already predicted it. Give it a try then,” the Black Emperor replied.
