Chapter 776 - Flute Same As Before

Those who were from Indigomoon Elysium had a nasty look on their face when Lin Yun won. After all, they had a grudge with Lin Yun that originated from Qing Ruoyou. If the Falling Aquatic Empyrean wasn’t around, they would’ve sent out Heavenly Soul Realm experts to kill Lin Yun a long time ago.

Although the elders didn’t think that Yan Luoyu would defeat Lin Yun, they didn’t expect him to lose after one sword. Clearly, Lin Yun was a lot stronger than when he was in Skymound City. The amount of improvement he showed sent chills down their spine.

Just like that, half of Yan Luoyu’s profound amber aura flew towards Lin Yun. Yan Luoyu had won several rounds only to have half of his profound amber aura taken away by Lin Yun. The amount of profound amber aura that he had was even more than what Lin Yun obtained so far. It made Lin Yun’s Dragoncloud Jade Token become a lot denser and a lot brighter.

“This brat isn’t simple…” The judge in the seventh group smiled with narrowed eyes as he stroked his beard. He originally thought that Yan Luoyu might be able to force out Lin Yun’s strength, but it ended with just one sword from Lin Yun.

Many spectators were shocked by this scene. After all, Yan Luoyu gave them the feeling that he could fight top-tier geniuses. But when Lin Yun drew his sword, everything instantly ended.

“What a powerful sword. Lin Yun seems to be on the same level as Feng Wudao.”

“Looks like Lin Yun can be ranked in the top ten among the seventh group.”

“Interesting… this is getting really interesting. Lin Yun probably only used 50% of his strength.”

“50%? That’s impossible. He used at least 70%.”

“Using 70% of his strength defeat Yan Luoyu instantly. That’s already heaven-defying.” Everyone began to discuss how strong Lin Yun actually was. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hehe, interesting.” Feng Wudao smiled as he looked at Lin Yun with fighting spirits blazing in his pupils.

“I admit defeat.” It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to get called up to the stage again, but his opponent forfeited instantly. Lin Yun rubbed his nose at this and smiled inwardly. This was the highest glory in the Draconic Banquet and also a form of respect for experts.

This glory originally belonged to the three kings and seven geniuses, but the newly risen geniuses gradually received the same treatment.

After this happened, Qin Yang looked at Lin Yun with a vicious gaze. Qin Yang had to spend more effort because there were still people who wanted to use him to build their reputation. However, Lin Yun’s opponents admitted defeat after he defeated Yan Luoyu with one attack.

With a darkened face, Qin Yang gritted his teeth, “You bastard. You better not run into me!”

“Don’t be depressed. This is good news for you. After all, it’s best not to reveal your strength in the first round.” Pavilion Master Plum smiled as he hesitated briefly before he asked, “Lin Yun, how much strength did you use in that attack?”

In Pavilion Master Plum’s view, Lin Yun must’ve used at least 40% of his strength; anything less would be absurd. When Feng Ye, Situ Yi and the others heard the question, they turned around curiously.

Lin Yun raised his hand with one finger slightly bent.

“10%!” All of them were shocked beyond belief. They knew that Lin Yun wouldn’t lie to them, so this made them realize that they had no idea who Lin Yun was. Could this really be the same Lin Yun who came from the Great Qin Empire’s Sword Firmament Pavilion?

Lin Yun smiled helplessly. What he meant was that he barely used 10% of his strength. Yan Luoyu was weak, meaning he wasn’t comparable to the top-tier geniuses. The reason why he garnered so much attention was because of his identity as a core disciple from the Indigomoon Elysium.

Lin Yun didn’t have to use his sword, but then he would have revealed his octaform Azure Dragon Enneaform. Things would get troublesome if he did that, so he drew his sword.

“Bai Lixuan ran into a formidable opponent!” Feng Ye spoke up, drawing everyone’s attention. Even Pavilion Master Plum looked nervous when he saw Bai Lixuan’s battle.

Bai Lixuan had finally encountered a formidable opponent on the Dragonsoaring Stage. His opponent was a top-tier genius Yan Jiu, who was ranked nineteen on the previous Dragoncloud Ranking. Yan Jiu was someone who used a saber and his saber technique was extremely peculiar.

No matter how Bai Lixuan attacked, he couldn’t break through Yan Jiu’s defences. In fact, his flaws were getting attacked faster than he could attack, not to mention that Yan Jiu’s cultivation was higher.

“Not good, Bai Lixuan is going to lose!” The Great Qin Empire’s party got nervous. They came from the same home, so they hoped that Bai Lixuan could go far.

“He won’t,” said Lin Yun. He knew that a top-tier genius couldn’t stop Bai Lixuan’s momentum.

“The potential of your saint physique is terrifying. If you had another six months, even I might not be able to suppress you. But I can right now, so you should admit defeat,” said Yan Jiu as he acknowledged Bai Lixuan’s strength. He didn’t want to go all out with Bai Lixuan as it would be disadvantageous to him if he got injured, not to mention that he might even lose to a nobody if Bai Lixuan were to injure him.

“What’s the name of your saber technique?” Bai Lixuan asked.

“Lone Peak Saber Art.” Yan Jiu’s eyes radiated with pride, which reflected the confidence he had in his saber technique.

“Long peak, good name.” Bai Lixuan muttered.

Yan Jiu smiled as he thought that his opponent would admit defeat after discovering the true intent behind his saber.

“Your saber technique is good, but you haven’t mastered it fully. I have a sword and I wish to seek some advice from you,” said Bai Lixuan seriously. The moment he spoke, everyone paying attention to him sucked in a cold breath because this was too ruthless. Everyone could tell that Yan Jiu was extremely conceited when it came to his saber technique.

But Bai Lixuan, a newly risen genius, dared to say that Yan Jiu’s saber technique wasn’t strong enough?

“Then let me experience it.” Yan Jiu gnashed his teeth as he retracted his smile.

“As you wish. Nine Heavens Dragon Dance!” Bai Lixuan’s sword aura underwent a huge change as his sword intent manifested into a dragon that roared as it charged down. When the dragon charged down, the entire sky seemed to tremble from thunderclouds.

The powerful gale made Yan Jiu close his eyes and his face twitch. As the dragon roared, his saber aura showed signs of being crushed by Bai Lixuan’s terrifying sword intent. This made his face change as he roared and pushed his wind intent to the limit.

There was no trick behind his attack as he executed the Lone Peak Saber Art fused with wind intent.

Under Yan Jiu’s attack, the dragon roared and slowly became more condensed to the point where its scales could be clearly seen. Not long later, Yan Jiu’s saber aura shattered from the dragon and he was pushed to the edge of the stage.

“The Lone Peak Saber Art is truly overbearing. If you reached a high stage in it, there’s no way I could have suppressed it with one sword. But you should admit defeat now.” Bai Lixuan said as he took a step forward.

Yan Jiu threw a mouthful of blood because Bai Lixuan repeated his words from earlier. But Yan Jiu didn’t have any intentions of fighting any longer, so he spoke up after hesitating for a while. “I admit defeat.”

“Thank you,” said Bai Lixuan as he sheathed his sword.

The crowd was shocked as a top-tier genius actually admitted defeat. This Draconic Banquet was truly filled with surprises. After all, the first round had provided many results.

“Nangong, how is my junior brother’s sword technique?” Jiang Ziye smiled.

Nangong Wanyu revealed a charming smile as he replied, “Not bad. If it was a year ago, I might not have been comparable.”

“What about now?” Jiang Ziye asked as she raised her brow. Nangong Wanyu merely smiled and didn’t bother responding.

“It’s Yue Weiwei’s turn!”

“Her opponent is Situ Feihu, another top-tier genius.” The crowd clamored when Yue Weiwei’s name was mentioned, which attracted Lin Yun’s attention. Up to this point, Lin Yun was always fighting when Yue Weiwei was fighting. He had heard that each of her battles were earth-shaking, but he didn’t have the opportunity to watch them. But now, he finally had the opportunity to watch her.

Yue Weiwei had a bewitching appearance and every single one of her movements was filled with a charm that far surpassed all the women in the Ancient Southern Domain. In fact, Qing Ruoyou, who was extremely popular, couldn’t even match her charm.

Yue Weiwei was matched with Situ Feihu, who was ranked eighteenth and even stronger than Yan Jiu. All of Situ Feihu’s matchups were exciting, not to mention that he was fighting Yue Weiwei.

“Out of all the beauties I’ve ever seen, you might be number one. But your beauty won’t help you in the Draconic Banquet.” Situ Feihu’s smile was gentle, but his tone was ruthless.

Yue Weiwei blinked her eyes and smiled, “Normally, beauty isn’t useful, but it’s different when it comes to my level of beauty.”

Her smile was so lethal that not even Situ Feihu wasn’t spared from her charm. But Situ Feihu quickly composed himself and no longer dared to look at Yue Weiwei directly.

“Be careful. I’m going to start now.” Yue Weiwei reached for the emerald jade flute hanging on her waist and placed it by her lips.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned when he saw her flute and he wondered if her flute sounded the same as before.
