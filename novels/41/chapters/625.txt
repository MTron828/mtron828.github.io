Chapter 626 - Fight

The Bloodwing Pavilion’s party walked over with three crimson-clothed old men in the lead. They were all in the lesser Yin-Yang stage, including the old man who spoke earlier. He was the inner sect’s Grand Elder and he was the strongest of the bunch.

But Lin Yun wasn’t fazed when facing the three elders’ pressure because of his sword intent. He only raised his brow and looked around to see that the Heavenly Soul Realm’s expert hadn’t moved. The old man was probably concerned about his identity or was fearful of Tang Yu.

The Threesolute Manor’s party didn’t seem to be interested in joining as they didn’t walk over with the Bloodwing Pavilion.

“Brat, we’re questioning you. Did you kill Leng Haoyu?” The Bloodwing Pavilion’s Grand Elder barked when he saw that Lin Yun had ignored him. He even poured his origin energy into his voice that could injure those who had a weak cultivation. His actions instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

However, Lin Yun wasn’t injured by it as his sword intent protected him. He replied, “Didn’t the Bloodwing Pavilion place a bounty on me? So what does it matter?”

“I’m asking you a question. Answer me! Did you kill Leng Haoyu?!” questioned the Grand Elder in rage.

“Why bother wasting my time? There were many people who witnessed it at the empyrean’s tomb,” retorted Lin Yun.

“Let’s just capture him back to the Bloodwing Pavilion and torture him,” said one of the elders..

“Let’s cripple him first.” The elders of the Bloodwing Pavilion had killing aura deep in their eyes. Based on their words, they didn’t even place Lin Yun in their eyes.

“How dare you! Lin Yun is a guest deacon of my Heavenly Province Academy. Since when is your Bloodwing Pavilion qualified to poke your nose into this matter?” The elders of the academy stood behind Lin Yun under the lead of Mo Ling. After all, Lin Yun had killed Leng Haoyu to save her.

When the three elders of the Bloodwing Pavilion saw Mo Ling step forward, they questioned coldly, “A guest deacon? How can a guest deacon be compared to the life of our Bloodwing Pavilion’s core disciple? You guys better not poke your nose into this matter or you guys can be prepared to pay the price for starting a war with the Bloodwing Pavilion!”

He was implying that a guest deacon would leave sooner or later. So a core disciple like Leng Haoyu was naturally more important to a sect. The tone from the Bloodwing Pavilion’s elders contained a very clear threat.

“Stop dreaming. Lin Yun is the benefactor of our academy. Even if he doesn’t belong to the academy, the academy won’t just stand here and do nothing,” said Mo Ling. Simultaneously, her attitude had shocked many people.

After all, Lin Yun was only a guest deacon who would leave sooner or later. So there was no need for them to start a war with the Bloodwing Pavilion. But in the next second, the three elders suddenly unleashed their pressure.

They had accumulated their pressure for a long time. So aside from Lin Yun, everyone was caught by surprise as they were sent several steps back. “Lass, you’re in no position to speak here. Can you even stop me from killing this brat?”

One of the Bloodwing Pavilion’s elders dashed forward and struck his palm at Lin Yun’s head. His abrupt action had caught everyone by surprise. If anyone took this attack head-on, they would be instantly killed.

When the Grand Elder spread his palms out, he left a claw on the ground and Lin Yun felt like he had fallen into a swamp. Lin Yun had always been a cautious person, so he reacted the second the Grand Elder moved.

Before his feet sank into the swamp, a Golden Crow Seal bloomed behind him and Lin Yun soared into the sky. When the ground exploded, a sand pillar one hundred meters tall had shot into the sky. Although Lin Yun had dodged the attack, he was still affected by the fluctuation as he began to spin in mid-air.

“So what if you can run?” The Grand Elder sneered as he retracted his palm before he unleashed an even more terrifying pressure at Lin Yun.

“How violent…”

“This is how unreasonable the Bloodwing Pavilion is? An elder at the Yin-Yang stage actually launched a sneak attack on a younger generation.”

“Hehe, they’re probably after Lin Yun’s Astral Pearl and are using revenge as a disguise. After all, the other sects came from afar and didn't have any Heavenly Soul Realm experts.”

“Lin Yun is probably gone. After all, the academy might not take the risk to protect him.”

“But Lin Yun isn’t a pushover. I didn’t even see how he dodged the palm earlier.”

“He’s someone that even defeated Ji Wuye. So how can he not have such capabilities?”

“I don’t think Lin Yun has changed much. The Bloodwing Pavilion seems determined to keep Lin Yun in the Withernorth Sea.”

Even if Lin Yun was strong, he was only in the greater Yang stage. There was an entire realm between him and the Grand Elder, so he was naturally in a disadvantageous position.

Lin Yun’s state wasn’t good under the Grand Elder’s attack, which made the Bloodwing Pavilion’s disciples and elders smirk.

“That fellow is really bold to kill a disciple of ours without having a background like us.”

“A guest deacon is ultimately a guest deacon. He thinks too highly of himself. No one can protect him since the Bloodwing Pavilion is determined to kill him.”

“I don’t believe that a Yin-Yang stage elder can’t do anything to him.” Those who were in the top ten on the outer ranking all looked at this scene with playful expressions.

“Elder Tang…” Mo Ling instantly turned to Tang Yu.

“Relax for now,” said Tang Yu as he wore a grave expression. He didn’t place the three Yin-Yang stage elders in his eyes, but he was fearful of the Bloodwing Pavilion’s Heavenly Soul Realm expert, Wu Feng. That fellow had his attention on him, so Tang Yu didn’t dare to make his move carelessly.

After all, Lin Yun would be killed if he was even a little careless. The current situation might be dangerous, but it wasn’t to the point of life and death. So Tang Yu knew that he had to keep his composure. Then again, dragging this on wasn’t a solution. If things were bad, then he would only risk being injured.

“Die!” Another roar echoed as the Grand Elder threw his palm out. When he threw his palm out, the ground collapsed as it raised a huge cloud of sand.

Lin Yun was in a terrible state being chased by the Grand Elder as he couldn’t draw his sword. He could only rely on his movement technique to dodge, and he knew that he couldn’t face the Grand Elder head-on without his sword or he would be heavily injured in a split second.

“This brat…” The Grand Elder frowned as he landed on the ground. He then threw out seventy-two palms in a row with each palm containing the power that could easily crush someone in the Yang stage. But even when facing his attacks, Lin Yun didn’t suffer any injuries. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After launching a series of attacks, the Grand Elder had no choice but to rest for a moment. But this had given Lin Yun the opportunity as Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword in mid-air. The Flower Burial Sword had been upgraded to a cosmic artifact, so it released a cold flash when it was drawn out.

“That’s a good sword!” Many people’s eyes lit up when they saw the Flower Burial Sword.

“Are you done running?” The Grand Elder laughed sinisterly as he dashed forward. With the crimson light escaping his body and taking form, he threw out a total of nine palms. Each palm was like a crimson mountain. When the nine mountains linked together, a massive mountain range was formed.

“Heavenly Cloud Shatter!” Lin Yun’s sword released a dazzling silver light that formed a sandstorm as it clashed with the descending mountain range like a thick blade.

“Now it’s my turn to attack!” Lin Yun’s eyes radiated with powerful sword intent as he unleashed everything. Along with a sword buzz, the Flower Burial Sword grew even more brilliant. When Lin Yun’s sword intent had reached a limit, a wild storm began to rise around him that made him look ethereal.

In that split second, all the elders and disciples were shocked and their faces changed drastically. “This sword intent…complete mastery! That’s definitely the xiantian sword intent at complete mastery!”
