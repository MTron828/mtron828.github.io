Chapter 955 - Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm!

Although the fight ended abruptly, it had also swept out like a storm throughout the city. The various realm’s cultivators who sneaked into the plaza shared what they saw. When the outcome of the fight got out, it instantly caused a huge uproar. If those who sneaked in weren’t unified in their words, everyone might even suspect that it was fake.

After all, the Bloodbone Realm and Blazeyang Realm couldn’t take down Lin Yun together? Especially Liu Mu who claimed that Lin Yun would pay the price. Now that he couldn’t do it, it would only make him a laughingstock in the Heavenly Path.

Many people knew that it would be uncertain who would be the one begging for his life if the five astral spirits’ owner didn’t stand out. At the same time, Lin Yun’s shock had also caught them by surprise. Most importantly, Lin Yun hadn’t even drawn his sword in the fight.

Just when his name was spreading throughout the city, Lin Yun found a quiet place in the plaza and sat down. Now, no one dared to say a word with him here. His fight with Liu Mu had fully proven his strength to the higher realms.

But Lin Yun could tell that Liu Mu was a lot stronger than Mo Yan and must have a trump card as well. Otherwise, his face wouldn’t be so nasty looking at him. If they continued to fight, he might be forced to reveal his sky sword intent or the full power of his Divine Glorysun Fist. Those were Lin Yun’s trump cards and he didn’t want to reveal them for a mere Liu Mu.

“I have to reach the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm soon. That way, it’ll be easy for me to fight them using Dustlight Sword Art alone.” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts as he sat on the ground. He now had the tribulation qualification and he only needed an opportunity for his strength to undergo a transformation.

He knew that it shouldn’t be hard to find that opportunity in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm before dealing with these people after he made his breakthrough. Furthermore, there was another reason why he was willing to stop the fight. He could sense Yu Haotian’s existence through the Glorysun Spirit. Since Yu Haotian had gotten the Glorymoon Spirit, this meant that he must be in the plaza looking at him.

Compared to his initial impulsive personality, Yu Haotian knew how to bear it now. When he was injured by Liu Mu, he could sense a killing intent directed at him but that was only for a split moment. If he had guessed it correctly, it would be from Yu Haotian.

“He must’ve gotten a lot stronger by now,” muttered Lin Yun while sweeping his glance around. But no matter how he tried, he couldn’t see Yu Haotian anywhere. Aside from that, the seven heads on the Azure Dragon Ranking were nowhere seen. They didn’t seem to be interested in astral spirits like the mysterious lady. But it would make no sense if they didn’t turn up for the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.

This meant that they might’ve already been here and only watched but didn’t come to the altar. What he had speculated wasn’t wrong. On a few tall buildings outside the shrine, there were seven people looking at what happened in the plaza.

“Impressive. This Lin Yun is a lot stronger than rumoured to be able to force Liu Mu to this state. If he takes another step further with his cultivation, even all of them joining forces together might not be able to do to him.” Someone smiled.

“The Heavenly Path is a place filled with miracles, but it’s indeed impressive that Lin Yun can come this far. I bet he must have his opportunities, and the divine astral pellets he refined might not be any lower than us,” said another person.

“Opportunities are only opportunities. Not many people can convert them into their strength and there are none like Lin Yun. Even if he doesn’t have any fortune in the Heavenly Path, he’ll rise sooner or later in Kunlun Realm,” said another. There might be a lot of opportunities in the Heavenly Path, but how many people could rise like Lin Yun?

“He’s only in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm. When he reaches the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm, he’ll have the qualification to go into the Azure Dragon Ranking or even the final ranking. At that time, he’ll rise for sure in the Heavenly Path. As of right now, he’s still a little too tender.” Although they were just casually chatting among themselves, anyone could hear the confidence in their words that even made the sky turn dark.

There were people in the city who noticed this phenomenon, but they couldn’t see anything when they looked over. There was an invisible barrier enveloping the seven of them which was extremely weird. Unless it was someone who had reached the same level as them, it was impossible for anyone to see their true appearance.

Right at this moment, purple light started distorting in the air before a woman walked out of it.

“Haha. What’re the seven heads of the Azure Dragon Region doing here? Or are you guys waiting for me?” A bewitching voice sounded out from the woman with a pair of eyes that could even captivate someone’s soul. She was Pei Xue, famed for her ruthlessness in the Heavenly Path.

Aside from Jun Mengchen and Qin Lin who had expected that she would come, the five others became alert. If Lin Yun was here, he would definitely recognize this as the mysterious woman who tried to capture him back then.

“Interesting. I’m surprised the snow beauty of the Vermillion Bird Region actually came. Are you alone or do you represent the war realm behind you?” A black-clothed youth smiled as he looked straight into Pei Xue’s eyes.

“Don’t worry. I’m only here to join the fun. I won’t compete with you guys for the ancient inheritances in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm,” smiled Pei Xue indolently.

“Join the fun?” The black-clothed youth raised his brow. He didn’t believe that someone like Pei Xue would come just to ‘join the fun’. Even if she wasn’t here for the inheritances in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, she must have other motives.

“What’s the matter? Can it be that the famous chief of the Azure Dragon Region, Luo Chen, is afraid of a helpless lady like me?” Pei Xue smiled. The chief she meant was the chief of the Azure Dragon Ranking.

But the black-clothed youth didn’t buy that and smiled, “Keep that ability of yours. If you’re a helpless lady, then not many men in the Heavenly Path can call themselves men.”

Right at this moment, Jun Mengchen spoke out, “She’s indeed here to join the fun. According to my knowledge, she’s here initially for Yue Weiwei and suffered at the hands of Lin Yun. I bet she’s here to take revenge.”

When Jun Mengchen mentioned the name ‘Yue Weiwei’, the faces of the others changed with fear flickering in the depth of their eyes. But they had a rapport to jump over the topic about Yue Weiwei.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Looks like this Lin Yun is really impressive to let our snow beauty suffer a loss. This alone has brought face to our Azure Dragon Region. But since you’re here, he won’t be able to escape from you in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm,” smiled Luo Chen.

Rolling her eyes at Luo Chen, Pei Xue continued, “I’m only here to join the fun. But I can tell you that a war realm from the Black Tortoise Region has their attention on the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. They’re the trouble for you guys. So don’t bother placing your attention on me.”

“War realm? This is troublesome.” Luo Chen’s eyes flashed before he smiled, “But this is the Azure Dragon Region. It won’t be that easy for them to take something from us.”

As time gradually passed, half a day was gone in the blink of an eye. With the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm’s opening approaching, more top-tiered higher realms were gathered in the plaza and the sheer multitude of people was a majestic scene.

The Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm was important to everyone, especially to geniuses who wanted to display their strength. Suddenly, the astral energy in the shrine became blazing with a violent aura spreading out. The sudden change in the atmosphere had caused Lin Yun to open his eyes and look at the sacred altar.

“Is it coming?” Lin Yun muttered before he stood up. At the same time, the faces of everyone in the plaza also became grave.

Right at this moment, the altar started trembling with ancient runes appearing in the air. When the runes intertwined at the top of the altar, a resounding dragon roar echoed out that summoned a thunderstorm in the sky. When boundless flames blazed at the top of the altar, the Glorysun Spirit in Lin Yun’s interspatial pouch started trembling. This was a sign that the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm was finally going to open.
