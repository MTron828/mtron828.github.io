Chapter 2034 - One Step Away

“What did you call me earlier?” Xin Yan broke the silence and looked at Lin Yun with a smile.

Lin Yun knew he couldn’t pretend any longer and smiled helplessly, “Big Sister Xin Yan.”

“Hmph, you really know how to act. Who taught you to say that you have a ‘friend’?” Xin Yan patted Lin Yun on his head.

“Big Sister Xin Yan, didn’t you also say you have a friend?” Lin Yun asked, rubbing his head.

“Hmph, continue talking and see how I’ll beat you to death!” Xin Yan glared at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun merely smiled and looked at Xin Yan in a daze. On a normal basis, he could barely restrain his feelings for Xin Yan, but his concern gushed out like water breaking through the dam when he saw her injured.

“I’ve already guessed your identity back at Six Holy City, and I confirmed it when I heard how my master addressed you. Junior Brother, you have hidden yourself really deeply,” Xin Yan sent a resentful look at Lin Yun.

“I’m sorry,” Lin Yun replied.

“Are you dumb? Why are you apologizing to me? I’m your big sister. Do you think I’ll blame you for it?” Xin Yan gave Lin Yun a wink.

“I…” Lin Yun hesitated for a long time before he continued, “I’m afraid because I’m guilty.”

“There’s nothing to feel guilty about. I will only feel heartache for my younger brother when I see you in this state,” Xin Yan said, looking at Lin Yun. She continued, “I watched the Draconic Banquet back in the Profound Amber Realm.”

“What?” Lin Yun was shocked to hear that.

“I bet you didn’t think of that, right?” Xin Yan smiled. “I left after seeing you become the champion. So don’t feel guilty because you’ve done nothing wrong. Not to mention I was the one who left myself.”

Lin Yun was stumped because he never thought of that.

“You’re the one who left that bottle of Demigod Wine, right?” Xin Yan smiled.

“Yeah,” Lin Yun replied.

“Junior Brother, I won’t blame you for anything,” Xin Yan said seriously. “So don’t dwell on that any longer.”

Hearing what she said, Lin Yun smiled and looked relaxed. He asked, “What’s with your wrist?”

“Master said that I possess the Great Yin Divine Physique, but it hasn’t been awakened yet. So it can only be considered the Great Yin Saint Physique, but my physique has surpassed ordinary saints,” Xin Yan explained. “When my Great Yin Divine Physique awakens, I’ll have to join Buddhism and look for the Ancestor to inherit the Great Yin Divine Physique inheritance.”

“Ancestor?” Lin Yun asked.

“My master’s Master. That person is very mysterious, and I have only seen her once,” Xin Yan said.

“No, I meant to ask if you’re joining Buddhism?” Lin Yun asked.

“What’s the matter? You can’t bear for me to join Buddhism?” Xin Yan asked.

Lin Yun was stumped when he heard that and was inwardly shocked. The Profound Maiden Courtyard might inherit the Buddhism lineage, but not every disciple has to join Buddhism. He asked, “Senior Sister, do you really have to take that step?”

“Let’s not talk about that anymore. What are you thinking about? Why do you look so irritated when you’re comprehending the sword technique? You nearly killed me,” Xin Yan joked half-heartedly.

Seeing that Xin Yan wasn’t willing to discuss it, Lin Yun put it aside and explained everything to her.

After hearing what he said, Xin Yan briefly hesitated before she said, “Junior Brother, you don’t have to be too worried about it. Your master definitely has trump cards against Tian Xuanzi. Otherwise, Tian Xuanzi would’ve charged into the Sword Sect, based on his personality, and he must fear something. Furthermore, there’s still my master and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. I believe they won’t let Tian Xuanzi disrupt your master’s tribulation.”

Lin Yun nodded because what Xin Yan said wasn’t wrong.

“Since your master sent you here, he must have hope that you can focus on your cultivation instead of worrying about him,” Xin Yan continued. “Within the Heavenly Dao Sect are the Dragon Origin Great Saint, Serene Dust Great Saint, and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint taking care of you. I believe your master has arranged everything. Spending too much time worrying about it and neglecting your cultivation will go against your master’s intentions, instead.”

Lin Yun was stunned, before he was suddenly enlightened and a smile rose on his lips. He smiled, “Thank you for enlightening me.”

“There’s no need to thank me. You could have thought of it if you spent more time. You’re just affected by the irritation within your heart,” Xin Yan said seriously.

“Even so, I must thank Senior Sister for this,” Lin Yun smiled.

“There’s no need to thank me. Focus on cultivating. Didn’t the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint give you the book of Divine Firefly Sword?” Xin Yan smiled.

“Nah. I want to rest for a while,” Lin Yun said. Now that they acknowledged each other, Lin Yun didn’t want to conceal his feelings any longer.

“Alright,” Xin Yan helplessly smiled and let Lin Yun lie down in her embrace while they shared each other’s experiences. They would smile whenever they talked about their experiences at the Firmament Sword Pavilion.

Lin Yun never felt so relaxed as he rested his head on Xin Yan’s lap. The two chatted, and Xin Yan occasionally caressed his hair as he fell asleep. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, Xin Yan was nowhere to be found.

“Senior Sister?” Lin Yun’s heart sank as he bounced up from the ground and began looking around. When he saw Xin Yan washing up with a smile, he heaved a sigh of relief. He was afraid Xin Yan would leave like she did in the past, and he would never be able to see her again.

After Xin Yan washed up, she said, “Junior Brother, you can’t be lazy today.”

“Never. I won’t be lazy,” Lin Yun said as he flipped through the book. The Divine Firefly Sword’s second section had a high threshold, and it was impressive if a Quasi-Saint could master the fourth or fifth sword form. One could be considered a monstrous genius if he could master the third sword form at the Nirvana Stage, and any forces would nurture them as a genius.

Lin Yun didn’t hope for much, but just hoped to master the seventh or eighth sword form before the Sword Assembly. It shouldn’t be difficult for him to reach the manifestation stage, but the minuscule stage was too far. Just like that, Lin Yun practiced the sword during the day and rested on Xin Yan’s lap at night.

Thirty-odd days passed in the blink of an eye, and the plaza before the Buddha statue was covered with afterimages with blooming phenomena.

“Withered Tree Coming To Life!”

“Rising Sun!”

“Polar Opposite!”

“Flaming Floral Silver Tree!”

“Driving Lightning!”

“Sky Incineration Flames!” Lin Yun performed up to the sixth sword form in one go. When he executed the Sky Incineration Flames, all the afterimages overlapped together. Lin Yun’s figure became clear with flames enveloping the sky, looking like it wanted to burn through heaven.

Lin Yun also manifested a giant with a flaming crown on its forehead, looking like a deity swinging its sword down with Lin Yun in harmony. When the sword landed on the ground, it created a tremor in the plaza, with cracks spreading around.

Far away, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, Serene Dust Great Saint, and Xin Yan were shocked when they saw this scene.

“He’s really energetic, but he must have been tired over the past month,” the Serene Dust Great Saint smiled, looking at Lin Yun with a doting gaze.

“To reach the sixth sword form at such a young age, he might really become the eleventh person,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. Over the past three thousand years, only ten people managed to master the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword, and they all became Sword Saints, with one becoming a Sword Emperor.

“Why are you guys here?” Lin Yun quickly walked over. His temperament had drastically changed over the past month, and he could control his sword intent well. If one didn’t pay attention to it, they wouldn’t notice the boundless sword intent hidden within his forehead.

“It looks like you’ve worked hard during this period.”

“To reach the sixth sword form in one month, you’re not that bad,” the Serene Dust Great Saint and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, but they soon unhappily turned to look at each other.

“Carry on boasting. I don’t believe you had such speed back then,” the Serene Dust Great Saint unhappily said.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint didn’t argue with the Serene Dust Great Saint and said, “Ye Qingtian, you have to go to the Hidden Sword Manor half a month from now.”

Lin Yun didn’t expect it to be so soon. He asked, “Who else is going aside from me?”

“Quasi-Saint Indigothunder will go with you. Aside from you, there won’t be anyone else,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“Please believe in me,” Lin Yun smiled.

“It’s pointless for more people to go if you can’t obtain the sword. If Shuying wasn’t at the Quasi-Saint Realm, she could have accompanied you,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Where is Senior Sister Bai now?” Lin Yun asked.

“She went to look for someone, and even I don’t know where she has gone,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

Lin Yun began to wonder who that person was that charmed the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden. According to Bai Shuying, they had only met once, and it was weird for her to be charmed by someone she met for the first time. Bai Shuying’s temperament was identical to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint; they were both icy beauties.

“What are you thinking about?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked.

“Nothing,” Lin Yun replied, recollecting his thoughts.

“Alright. You can stop practicing the Divine Firefly Sword for the next half month. You should go to the Celestial Purging Mountain,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“The Celestial Purging Mountain?” Lin Yun was stunned when he heard that.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint nodded, “That senior wants to meet you, provided you can make it through the last two levels.”

Lin Yun squinted his pupils because he knew who the senior was. That person was the previous Heavenly Dao Sect’s sect master who died in the hands of Yu Qingfeng. His soul then stayed in the Celestial Purging Mountain as the artifact spirit of the ninth level. Speaking of which, he should make a trip over and try to reach greater mastery of the Astral Sword Intent, if possible.

Ye Guhan said that the Astral Sword Intent would undergo a drastic transformation after reaching greater mastery. Lin Yun had killed a lot of Blood Crows within the Myriad Graves Valley, and his accumulation should be enough. He was only one step away from greater mastery of the Astral Sword Intent.
