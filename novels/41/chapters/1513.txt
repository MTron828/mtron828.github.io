Chapter 1514 - Stop Acting (1)

Seeing that the box’s restriction would be lifted soon, Lin Yun walked out of the corridor, wielding his Flower Burial Sword. After coming this far, he no longer needed to preserve his strength. After all, these people were right. Everyone could fight for the stone box.

The ten-odd people in the palace were looking at the stone box with their eyes blazing with flames, and they weren’t bothered by Lin Yun’s appearance. In their eyes, Lin Yun was only at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. But in the next moment, it was hard for them not to pay attention to him as a powerful sword intent suddenly exploded and swept throughout the palace, condensing into a violent storm.

The weapons in their hands began to vibrate under the intimidation of the sword intent, and this made everyone shocked with crisp sword vibrations echoing out. Shortly after, a sword ray swept out, and those cultivators who couldn’t avoid it were sent flying away with terrifying wounds left on their bodies.

“Who is that?” The demonic sect’s disciples were shocked. They wondered who that person was and had no impression of Lin Yun. This made them wonder where Lin Yun got the courage to make a move against them.

While they were feeling uncertain and pondered if they should join hands to deal with him, Lin Yun’s sword intent exploded with his complete mastery of the firmament sword intent exposed. This instantly enveloped him in sword rays, making everyone’s faces change.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When Lin Yun swung the Flower Burial Sword, the Aquaheaven Sword Technique that had reached the manifestation stage was being unleashed in the palace. When the boundless sword aura swept out like a violent storm, it filled every corner of the hall, and no one could avoid it.

Nine swords later, no one remained on their feet in the palace. All of them were covered in blood while lying on the ground. Their eyes were filled with fear and disbelief when they looked at Lin Yun again, and they knew they weren’t on the same level as him.

They couldn’t imagine how someone at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm could unleash such a terrifying sword aura. He had suppressed everyone with his sword. When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, he didn’t look at those on the ground and walked towards the stage.

The moment when Lin Yun opened the box, a figure suddenly appeared. This person wielded a saint sword. He was hidden in the void, waiting to make a move. His attack was ruthless and at a tricky trajectory.

Those lying on the ground had fear in their eyes while holding their breaths. They naturally saw the person who made the move, and this person was the junior brother of the Seven Absolute Palace’s chief disciple, Lu Xuezhen. He was a famous expert within the seven demonic sects.

He was considered a core disciple of the Seven Absolute Palace, with his cultivation reaching the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, and he was a lot stronger than many guests.

Everyone knew that Lin Yun would die, but no one had any trace of joy on their faces because they knew that Lu Xuezhen was a ruthless person. They were all heavily injured, and they couldn’t put up any resistance before Lu Xuezhen.

But something bizarre happened when Lin Yun retrieved the jade bottle from the box. It was as though he had an eye at the back of his head. He quickly turned around and drew his sword.

His sword was aimed at the center of Lu Xuezhen’s brows. Before Lu Xuezhen could even react, he had already lost his life with a drop of blood dripping down his forehead. Everything happened too quickly, and Lu Xuezhen still had disbelief in his pupils. He was the one to attack first, but he couldn’t believe how someone could be so fast.

With reluctance and doubt, Lu Xuezhen collapsed onto the ground and lost his life. When Lin Yun swept his gaze around, everyone else who was still hidden within the corridors could feel chills run down their spines.

But Lin Yun didn’t bother with them and sheathed his sword before opening the jade bottle. When the dense fragrance was emitted, the pellets in the jade bottle were Dragon Origin Pellets, and there were a total of nine.

Only saints could refine the Dragon Origin pellets, and they were highly beneficial to Samsara Edict Realm experts if they refined them. So the benefits for Lin Yun were naturally great. Speaking of which, he had previously obtained a Dragon Origin Pellet from his senior brother, Feng Jue.

Stowing the jade bottle, Lin Yun immediately headed towards the Blue Dragon Palace's second level. More accurately speaking, this palace had nothing to do with the Blue Dragon Palace. It was more accurate to call it the Blue Dragon Trial.

After he left, the suffocating atmosphere in the palace finally dissipated, and everyone could hear the sighs of deep breaths from everyone.

“Who is that person? Why is he so terrifying? …I’ve never heard of someone like him before…”

“He wasn’t only terrifying. Judging from his strength, no one could suppress him except the chief disciples!”

“He seems to be a guest invited by the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. I have seen him before from afar. But he was hidden too deeply back then.” Everyone on the ground began to discuss Lin Yun’s identity, and they had shock on their faces.

The second level had many palaces, along with similar stages and boxes. There was also a similar hall and a passage to the next level.

The chief disciple of the Hundred Ghost Gate, Chen Kui, quietly appeared in a hall by himself. Upon seeing him, everyone in the hall who were fighting amongst themselves, quickly stopped.

“Chen Kui…” Everyone’s faces changed, and their hands began to tremble when they saw Chen Kui.

“I’ll count to three before making a move. So it’ll depend if you guys are fortunate enough to escape.” Chen Kui smiled as he looked at all of the nervous cultivators with a playful gaze.

But no one would believe his words. They quickly fled for their lives before Chen Kui could finish. This surprised Chen Kui because he wanted to toy with everyone by counting down. But he never expected that no one would believe his words.

“Where’s the trust between people?” Chen Kui was someone ranked in the top seven hundredths on the Elysium Core Ranking. This scene made him shake his head with disappointment in his pupils as he took a step forth.

Eighteen ghostly figures flew out from his body, and each ghost was translucent with an actual body, looking eerie and bizarre. When the ghosts chased after everyone, the ghosts revealed sinister smiles before they passed through those fleeing cultivators.

When those ghosts passed through the cultivators, the cultivator’s lifeless corpses fell to the ground. When the ghosts returned to Chen Kui, there wasn’t a single person standing in the hall.

“In the end, they’re mere ants…” Chen Kui shook his head and walked towards the blue stage.

This scene was seen by Lin Yun, who was in the passage. This surprised him because Chen Kui’s method of attacking was bizarre, and this murdering method was unusual.

But the firmament sword intent could cut through anything. So regardless of what sort of lifeform the ghosts were, this didn’t mean Lin Yun was helpless before them. But he just didn’t think there was a need to clash with them. So Lin Yun quietly retreated and headed to the next level.

“Is there someone here?” Chen Kui suspiciously looked around. He believed in his senses and could sense that someone was looking at him. After reaching his level, his senses had been honed to a terrifying height.

Chen Kui naturally trusted his senses. But since that person didn’t dare to show up, this meant that it probably wasn’t an enemy worth his attention. When he opened the box, there was a saint pellet in it, and the saint pellet contained several powerful ghosts.

“Beast Soul Pellet?” Chen Kui could no longer maintain his composure when he saw the saint pellet because this saint pellet was precisely what he needed. Could it be that this palace had an artifact spirit around that could sense the cultivation attributes of the winner, and this was why he could receive a treasure compatible with him? If that was really so, this meant that this palace wasn’t the genuine Blue Dragon Palace but a trial.

“Interesting!” Chen Kui laughed. His interest in the Blue Dragon Palace suddenly increased by a whole lot. Even if he couldn’t obtain the Divine Dragon Bone in the end, this opportunity was shocking enough.
