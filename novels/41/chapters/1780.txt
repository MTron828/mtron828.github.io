Chapter 1781 - God of the Sword

Shi Feng was curious about Lin Yun‚Äôs answer, but the latter had no intention of telling him. Thus, he could only change the topic. Not long after, Death Swordsman Yan Tie and Cloud Swordsman also came over.

Yan Tie wanted to come over long ago, but he wasn‚Äôt as thick-skinned as Shi Feng. But when he saw Lin Yun happily chatting with Shi Feng, he eventually came over with the Cloud Swordsman.

When four swordsmen sat at the same table, the pavilion Lin Yun was in became lively. Many people had already noticed this scene, and seeing the four swordsmen sitting together so harmoniously was weird.

After all, swordsmen were arrogant, and it was rare for a swordsman to acknowledge another swordsman in the same generation. Now that the three swordsmen gathered in Lin Yun‚Äôs pavilion, they acknowledged Lin Yun‚Äôs position as the strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

But after the Wind Edge Lord made a move, it made the title as first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking insignificant. Shi Feng lost to the Wind Edge Lord, which further showed how strong the top ten on the Dragon Pulse Ranking were.

In everyone‚Äôs eyes, they felt that even if Lin Yun made a move, he would probably lose terribly against the top ten of the Dragon Pulse Ranking. But Lin Yun wasn‚Äôt bothered about this. The Martial Dao Tea Party was brilliant.

After the Wind Edge Lord and Shi Feng‚Äôs battle, the heated atmosphere in Thunderblood Square gradually calmed down. After a series of battles, everyone took some time to digest them.

Everyone was chatting while drinking tea in their pavilions, and those who were acquainted with each other gradually began to move around. This was one of the charms of the Martial Dao Tea Party. For the younger generation, this sort of event was suitable for them.

Before they knew it, a night had passed. As for Lin Yun, he was either chatting, observing the fights on the Thunderstorm Battlestage, or meditating to cultivate and perfect his Azure Dragon Sword Art. Occasionally, when he was in the mood, he would take out the Thunderstorm Zither and play it, attracting the attention of many people.

His melody was beautiful, and the artistic concept contained within it was profound. It sounded close to nature. On the contrary, this amazed many people, including the people fighting on the stage, robbing them of their attention.

Then again, Lin Yun didn‚Äôt spend much time playing the Thunderstorm Zither because he mainly observed the battles on the stage.

Close to a thousand people were participating in the Martial Dao Tea Party, many of whom were proficient in the Wind and Lightning Intent. There were also those who grasped the Thunderstorm Intent. Whenever those people fought, Lin Yun would observe the profundities in their martial intents to perfect his Azure Dragon Sword Art.

While he absorbed insights like a sponge, he gradually comprehended something, and he now had an outline for the eleventh sword form of the Azure Dragon Sword Art. The Azure Dragon Sword Art was a profound sword technique, and there were a total of ten sword forms. The tenth sword form, Universal Thunderstorm, was born from the azure dragon and, yet, transcended the azure dragon.

But what about after he transcended? The Universal Thunderstorm wasn‚Äôt only a summary but was also a prologue. He was in a pretty awkward position because he couldn‚Äôt execute the Carefree 9 Swords and was lacking in sword techniques. This also restricted him from fighting with his full strength.

But if he could comprehend the seventh sword form of the Azure Dragon Sword Art, in addition to the first sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword and Universal Thunderstorm, he would have three ultimate moves, and they would equate to three trump cards.

As time passed, Lin Yun‚Äôs insight increased as he watched more battles. Born from the azure dragon, and yet, transcended the azure dragon. In general, it still contained the essence of the Azure Dragon. Otherwise, it would be meaningless if he lost the Azure Dragon‚Äôs profundity as the foundation.

So this sword should be like this‚Ä¶ As the Martial Dao Tea Party continued, Lin Yun closed his eyes and was fully immersed in his sword ocean. Deep within his sword ocean was a golden human executing the Azure Dragon Sword Art, and the Azure Dragon Sword Soul soared around on the ocean.

The Azure Dragon Claw, Azure Dragon Tail, Azure Dragon Eyes, Azure Dragon Head‚Ä¶

The sword forms were continuously disassembled before they were reconstructed. In addition to his comprehension of the Thunderstorm Intent, Lin Yun could faintly feel a new door opening up to him.

The door was only opened by a crack, but a golden radiance was gushing out of it. There seemed to be something hidden behind the door, but he didn‚Äôt know what was beyond the door. He could feel a majestic sword aura hidden behind the door, so this naturally filled Lin Yun‚Äôs heart with curiosity.

He had speculated that the genuine Azure Dragon Sword Art was hidden behind the door. The Universal Thunderstorm was like the prologue, and the current Azure Dragon Sword Art he practiced was just the tip of the iceberg.

This gradually piqued his interest, and he was progressively overwhelmed by excitement. He rejoiced and started tapping his right hand on the table. Lin Yun casually tapped his fingers on the table without any empowerment of dragon origin and martial intent.

It might seem like random movements, but he was tapping his fingers on the table in a fascinating, mysterious rhythm. Initially, the three swordsmen weren‚Äôt bothered by it, and were watching the battles on the stage.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Lin Xiao doing?‚Äù Yan Tie was the first to notice something wasn‚Äôt right, and turned to look at Lin Yun tapping on the table.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Enlightenment, perhaps?‚Äù Shi Feng said softly.

The Cloud Swordsman looked at Lin Yun‚Äôs fingers and smiled, ‚ÄúNow that you mentioned it, it‚Äôs quite rhythmic. Is it some kind of ancient score?‚Äù

‚ÄúGo and ask him.‚Äù Yan Tie said, wanting to call out to Lin Yun.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt!‚Äù Yue Weiwei suddenly said sternly, stopping Yan Tie from calling Lin Yun with a grave expression.

Yan Tie was stunned by Yue Weiwei‚Äôs reaction, and the two other swordsmen were also surprised. But soon, their faces drastically changed, and their mouths were wide open.

There was a powerful sword aura spreading out from Lin Yun. The range was small, just within a few feet of the pavilion. But this wasn‚Äôt the reason why the three swordsmen were shocked. They were shocked because they realized that they couldn‚Äôt move when Lin Yun tapped his fingers on the table. Only their thoughts could still process the situation.

Lin Yun‚Äôs act of tapping the table seemed to contain a form of profundity, and the rhythm had gradually reached the same rhythm as their heartbeats. They were shocked to discover that their heart rates had reached a rhythm with Lin Yun‚Äôs fingers.Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n))

When Lin Yun increased his tapping pace, their hearts would beat faster and vice-versa. But that wasn‚Äôt what was terrifying about it. When Lin Yun stopped his tapping, their heartbeats also paused. This naturally made them feel a chill run down their spines, and their backs were covered in a cold sweat.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt panic, and don‚Äôt try to resist. He has received enlightenment, so he should be in a state of unity with the sword. Use your sword intents to sense his rhythm, and you might be able to benefit from it.‚Äù Yue Weiwei said.

But Yue Weiwei was clearly still worried, and she warned, ‚ÄúRemember not to resist. Your sword intents are weaker than his, so you guys will be injured if you do. I‚Äôm afraid Big Brother Lin will also be injured at that time, too.‚Äù

One with the sword? One as the heaven, the sword as the dome, and one with the sword.

They were shocked, and could hear buzzing sounds within their minds. Was the ‚Äòone with the sword‚Äô Yue Weiwei said what they thought? If that was the case, didn‚Äôt that mean that Lin Xiao has grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent?

No words could describe the shock they were feeling right now. But they were only briefly stunned before they did as Yue Weiwei said. They didn‚Äôt try to resist the sword intent but tried to merge themselves into it.

But they were still worried. If Lin Yun wasn‚Äôt willing to accept them, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to sense Lin Yun‚Äôs insight into sword dao. After all, who would be so generous as to share their insight into sword dao with others?

But reality proved they thought too much about it because they managed to integrate themselves into the rhythm. Naturally, this discovery shocked them, but they soon closed their eyes and began to comprehend.

When they shut their eyes, they ‚Äòsaw‚Äô something shocking. There was a canvas, and Lin Yun‚Äôs five fingers were like brushes drawing on the canvas. As a dragon roar echoed from the canvas, they could see a person practicing the sword on an ocean within the canvas.

As sword rays shone from the surroundings, an azure dragon danced along with the sword rays. They were familiar with this sword technique. It was the Azure Dragon Sword Art that Lin Yun previously used.

Simultaneously, they could clearly sense the Azure Dragon Intent coming from the person drawn with ink rising rapidly. In the beginning, it was a primitive version of the Azure Dragon Intent that came from his talent and instincts. It might be massive, but it was crude.

As the Azure Dragon Sword Art continued to be unveiled, the Azure Dragon Intent was becoming like a rough jade being polished, becoming increasingly more beautiful. It was like a flawless jade containing vast power.

This made that figure look like a supreme being, and his aura continued to rise. When the radiance he gave off reached a limit, the Azure Dragon Intent broke through the limit and reached the fifth grade. This shocked the three swordsmen, and they felt it was unbelievable because it was too shocking.

‚ÄúHow is this possible?!‚Äù

‚ÄúCan he really be a genius from the Azure Dragon‚Äôs lineage?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is the only possibility!‚Äù The thoughts of the three swordsmen processed rapidly, and they were shocked by the talent Lin Yun showed. He was comprehending out of nowhere and making a breakthrough on the spot.

The Martial Dao Tea Party was for everyone to interact and improve by observing the battles of others. Lin Yun brought this to the limit, and absorbed the merits of others like a sponge.

When his Azure Dragon Intent made a breakthrough, several opponents appeared before the person swinging his sword, and those opponents looked familiar to the three swordsmen. They were briefly shocked before they realized that those people were geniuses who fought in the Martial Dao Tea Party.

‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ Isn‚Äôt that me?‚Äù Yan Tie soon discovered one of the blurred figures executing the Death Dance. Soon, another person appeared, and this was the Wind Swordsman, Shi Feng. Even the Wind Edge Lord appeared as an opponent. Lin Yun absorbed everyone who fought at the tea party.

When the canvas suddenly shattered, the three swordsmen were thrown out of their trance-like state. Lin Yun also stopped tapping his fingers on the table. It felt like they woke up from a dream. They opened their eyes and looked at Lin Yun, sensing Lin Yun‚Äôs sword aura retracting into his body.

The three swordsmen exchanged a glance, and were deeply shocked. They knew Lin Yun was digesting his insight and that he would undergo a transformation when he reopened his eyes.

‚ÄúHe wants to walk on his own path.‚Äù Yan Tie said. ‚ÄúThe Azure Dragon Clan‚Äôs sword techniques are strong, but he probably doesn‚Äôt want to be limited by his predecessors. He wants to walk his own path in sword dao.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a little terrifying. Lin Xiao‚Äôs heart in sword dao is much firmer than ours, and he has embarked on a path that no one has taken. The moment he clears his path, he‚Äôll reach a great height, and he can even fight ancient deities with his strength‚Ä¶ He might even walk on the path of a Sword God!‚Äù Shi Feng sighed.

What was a Sword God? That was the god of swords. Becoming a god in an era without deities was impossible, and it was even more impossible to become a Sword God. Even in ancient times, it was unsure whether a Sword God existed.

Not every swordsman could be called a Sword God upon becoming a deity, just like how not every saint who uses the sword could be called a Sword Saint. A Sword God was a path no one had taken before, and they didn‚Äôt even dare to think about it.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, the light within his pupils had been recollected. The two souls within his sword ocean underwent a transformation, and even his Azure Dragon Saint Physique was elevated. When he let out a breath, he was excited because this was a surprise.

He only wanted to see if there was an eleventh sword form in the Azure Dragon Sword Art and receive another trump card. But he never expected that he would make a breakthrough in the Azure Dragon Sword Art, reaching the deification stage.

There were three stages above complete mastery. They were the manifestation stage, the minuscule stage, and the deification stage.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù Lin Yun was surprised when he discovered the three swordsmen looking at him as if they were looking at a god, and they didn‚Äôt even dare to look him in the eyes. All three of them sat upright, looking nervous and uneasy as if they weren‚Äôt worthy of sitting with him. So this naturally made him feel weird.

‚ÄúThey feel that you‚Äôre going to become a Sword God.‚Äù Yue Weiwei smiled and roughly shared an overview of what had happened earlier.

After hearing what Yue Weiwei said, Lin Yun couldn‚Äôt help laughing. He had an enlightenment and didn‚Äôt expect these three to think so much. Sword God? Even Yu Qingfeng was only the Sword Emperor. Receiving a title with the sword wasn‚Äôt easy, and he had never even considered it.

When the three swordsmen came to their senses, their expressions became awkward. They knew they were over thinking too much because they had been too shocked earlier.

Taking a sip of the tea, Lin Yun smiled, ‚ÄúBut who knows what will happen in the future?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt think about becoming a Sword God. He wanted to walk his own path, just like his master, the Radiant Sword Saint. He believed that with the sword in his hand, he would grow to a height one day where he could compete with the Nine Emperors.
