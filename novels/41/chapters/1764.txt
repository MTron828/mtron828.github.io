Chapter 1765 – Three-Lives Realm (1)

Retracting his gaze, Lin Yun replied, “I’m naturally not afraid of the pain, and I’m also not afraid of the process. I’m just feeling conflicted.”

As a swordsman, Lin Yun was decisive when it came to many things, but he hesitated when it came to the Divine Azure Overlord Physique.

“There are other reasons?” Mu Xueling asked, and she stopped tapping the jade slip on the table.

Nodding her head, Lin Yun replied, “I have cultivated the Azure Dragon Saint Physique in the past before practicing the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art now. After all, I have a Blue Dragon Bone. According to my Big Brother, if the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art reaches perfection, there’s a chance it will form into the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.”

Mu Xueling’s expression became grave when she heard that because there was a difference between a saint and a divine physique. It might sound like there was a difference in one word, but the gap was drastic and unimaginable.

“If I remember correctly, the Azure Dragon Divine Physique only exists in legends. In ancient times, no one had achieved it, and no one knows the specific cultivation method.” Mu Xueling said. She read many books, and she knew many secrets. But there was little to almost nothing about the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. More accurately, no one has achieved it before.

“The Divine Azure Overlord Physique is naturally stronger than the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art without question, but it might not be comparable to the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. At the very least, they each have their advantages and disadvantages.” Lin Yun said.

The Divine Azure Overlord Physique was terrifying and was mainly meant for fighting. After all, he could even ignite his vitality to receive a significant boost in fighting prowess. If he ignited all his vitality, his strength might multiply tenfold.

But the Azure Dragon Divine Physique’s strength lies in longevity. It might not be able to compare to the Divine Azure Overlord Physique regarding fighting prowess, but he would have endless vitality. They each had their own advantages, and it was hard to see which was stronger.

But no matter how he looked at it, the Azure Dragon Divine Physique was more suitable for his swordsmanship. If the Azure Dragon Divine Physique combined with his swordsmanship, his fighting prowess might not be inferior to the Divine Azure Overlord Physique. The Azure Dragon wielded thunderstorms, and the Blue Dragon wielded lifeforce.

“It’s no wonder why you’re so conflicted. You’re conflicted because the Divine Azure Overlord Physique can allow your strength to undergo a great boost quickly, but it isn’t suitable to your swordsmanship in the long run.” Mu Xueling said.

Lin Yun nodded in acknowledgment. Mu Xueling was smart.

“The Azure Dragon’s lineage is powerful, and they gave you the three treasures probably because they wanted you to compete for the Azure Dragon Lord’s position. If you don’t practice the Divine Azure Overlord Physique, you might run into opponents who possess it in the future when you encounter the other branches of the Azure Dragon’s lineage.” Mu Xueling said. “At that time, you’ll lose if you only have the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“How about this? I’ll give up on the Divine Azure Overlord Physique. But the Divine Azure Blood is a great treasure. I can use it to cultivate the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art along with my cultivation.” Lin Yun said.

“I’m afraid you won’t be able to finish refining it anytime soon.” Mu Xueling said.

“Then I’ll use a Three-Lives Fruit first.” Lin Yun said. He now had two Three-Lives Fruits. If he had to hesitate whether to use it in the Dragon Pulse Realm or Samsara Edict Realm, he didn’t have to consider that now. One was enough for him now, and he could save the other for when he reached the Samsara Edict Realm.

“Which one of these two?” Lin Yun asked, taking out the two Three-Lives Fruits. One was given to him by Jiang Li, and the other was obtained together with Yue Weiwei.

“This one. This is roughly one year, and the other is at least five years. You can use it after reaching the Samsara Edict Realm. Remember, you must save it for when you’re in the Samsara Edict Realm.” Mu Xueling looked serious when she warned him.

Lin Yun didn’t know her intentions, but that didn’t go against his plan. He planned to preserve one for when he reached the Samsara Edict Realm.

“How are you able to tell the difference?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“Their weight.” Mu Xueling said. “Time also has weight. So, what will you do with the Azure Dragon’s Soul? If you plan to inject it into the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, I can help you. If you want to inject it into your sword, you must figure out a way yourself.”

“I’ll have to trouble Saint Elder, then.” That was also what Lin Yun planned, since he had no intention of injecting it into the Flower Burial Sword.

“Don’t finish refining the Divine Azure Blood. Leave some behind, and you can get a Divine Spiritualist to help you engrave a divine rune on your Divine Astral Flower if you run into one.” Mu Xueling said.

“There are Divine Spiritualists in the Kunlun Realm? But can’t Divine Spiritualists draw divine runes by themselves? So why save some of the Divine Azure Blood?” Lin Yun asked.

“If they drew without materials, the divine runes won’t last long. Only a divine rune drawn with divine blood can be preserved for a long time, but there’s still no guarantee that it’ll last for eternity.” Mu Xueling explained.

“You seem to know a lot about Divine Spiritualists.” Lin Yun stated, but he soon regretted it because Mu Xueling would probably say she read it from books.

“My aunt is a Divine Spiritualist.” But unexpectedly, Mu Xueling answered something different after a brief hesitation. When Lin Yun fell into deep thought, Mu Xueling continued, “My aunt is Weiwei’s mother.”

Lin Yun was taken aback by the news, and he didn’t know if Mu Xueling meant an aunt related by blood or something else.

“I’ll have to trouble Saint Elder with the Azure Dragon’s Soul, then. I will first refine the Divine Azure Blood.” When Lin Yun was done, he handed the Dragon Sealing Monument and Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella to Mu Xueling before activating the Three-Lives Fruit.

When he activated the Three-Lives Fruit, the fruit disintegrated, and a vortex appeared that seemed to be connected to another time and space.

Stowing the jade slips recording the Azure Dragon Sword Art and Divine Azure Overlord Physique, he took the Lotus Treasure Bottle and entered the vortex without any hesitation. His entire world began to spin, and he could feel himself passing through several membrane layers.

Ultimately, he came to a mysterious space, only ten miles in radius. Beyond that was an abyssal darkness that even his sword intent couldn’t penetrate. This should be the Three-Lives Realm; he wasn’t sure how long he could last here.

“Let’s start with refining the Divine Azure Blood.” Lin Yun had already refined the bottle earlier, so he could control it as he wished. The moment the bottle cap popped off, a majestic suction force swept out, pulling him into the vortex before landing on a blood lake. There was only a drop of divine blood, but this lake was thousands of feet in size.
