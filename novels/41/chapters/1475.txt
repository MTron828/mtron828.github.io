Chapter 1476 - Spar

There were still thirty-eight days, and he didn't have much time to prepare. After all, he could predict that it would be dangerous, no matter where the Divine Dragon Bone was, and he didn’t have enough trump cards now.

Aside from the Dragon-Blooded Crystal that he had just refined and the Azure Dragon Saint Art that reached the eleventh stage, his greatest trump card was the quasi-fifth grade sword intent. He also had two sword techniques, the Aquaheaven Sword Technique and the Carefree 9 Swords.

The Divine Solar Lunar Fist was barely usable against normal opponents, but it couldn’t threaten any transcendent geniuses. So this made him wonder if he should take some time and see what secrets there were in the Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits.

Lin Yun quickly burnt the note and found Lil’ Purple strolling by the spiritual lake. When Lil’ Purple heard what Lin Yun said, her eyes lit up, “There is news on the Divine Dragon Bone?”

She was very guilty about it deep down. Even after she compensated him with the Blood Flame Divine Rune, Lil’ Purple didn’t think it was enough to compensate Lin Yun. After all, it wasn’t a natural divine rune, and the value was much lower than the True Dragon Bone that was left behind by the Azure Dragon King, which contained a naturally formed divine rune.

“Yeah, but I don’t have much information about it. And my current strength doesn’t seem sufficient…” Lin Yun said truthfully while nodding his head.

But Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun with contempt when she heard that. Lin Yun had already crushed the entire Earth Ranking by himself, and he said his strength was still lacking?

“It’s fine. With this empress here, I’ll ensure you get it!” Lil’ Purple smiled while she patted her chest.

“That’s what I’m thinking of as well. So don’t sleep during this period of time to comprehend the Myriad Lightning Divine Rune and phoenix tree. I’ll be needing your help this time.” Lin Yun said as he looked at Lil’ Purple with a grave expression.

Anything related to divine dragon bones was significant since they were considered forbidden. There was no way the Divine Dragon Empire would allow their information to leak out. After all, the Divine Dragon Bone could significantly boost a cultivator’s strength, and they had always been in the hands of the Divine Dragon Empire.

Even in the Divine Dragon Empire, obtaining a Divine Dragon Bone wasn't easy. Obtaining it in private could be considered a capital offense, and leaking information about it was a death sentence. Those were what An Liuyan told him, and she even said it was practically impossible to get one through an ordinary transaction.

Lin Yun was rejoicing at the fact that he brewed the Golden Dragon Bone, or it would’ve been troublesome if he gave it to someone else. This also made him wonder where Qin Cang got the Golden Dragon Bone.

There was a huge possibility that it was a reward from his clan. After all, only the Nether Divinity Saint Clan had been conferred a title by the Divine Dragon Empire amongst the ten saint clans, making the Nether Divinity Saint Clan a respected titled clan. So there was a high possibility that the Golden Dragon Bone was bestowed by the Divine Dragon Empire, which was later given to Qin Cang.

“Alright.” Lil’ Purple also kept a smile on her face when she saw the grave expression on Lin Yun’s face.

“I’ll be out for a while.” Lin Yun smiled as he caressed her head.

“Where are you going?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“To the Golden Firmament Peak!”

An hour later, an uproar exploded at the Saint Pool Square located at the Golden Firmament Peak. Everyone’s gazes fell onto a person. All of them wore complicated expressions when that person sat down. It also didn’t take long for the entire Saint Pool Square to be emptied and everyone standing in a corner, not daring to approach the square.

“What is this guy doing in our Golden Firmament Peak?”

“Is he here to provoke us?”

“How can we cultivate if he sits there?” The one who sat down was Lin Yun, and his appearance caused an uproar amongst the disciples of the Golden Firmament Peak. No one knew what he was there for, but no one dared to provoke or question him.

But Lin Yun merely smiled while turning a deaf ear to the commotion in the surroundings. He was waiting for someone and knew that person would definitely appear.

Sure enough, a figure appeared at Saint Pool Square half an hour later, and that person’s face sank when he saw Lin Yun.

“Senior Brother Jin is here!”

“Lin Yun is here to look for Senior Brother Jin?” Everyone began to speculate as they saw Jin Xuanyi approach Lin Yun and were briefly chatting before they left the area.

When Lin Yun was brought to Jin Xuanyi’s residence, he looked around and smiled. “This place is pretty good.”

“It’s alright. This is one of the ten best residences in the Golden Firmament Peak…” Jin Xuanyi smiled.

But before he could finish, Lin Yun suddenly smiled. “But it’s still somewhat lacking compared to my Cloud Soaring Peak.”

This instantly made Jin Xuanyi’s smile freeze on his face as he suppressed his anger, “Senior Brother Lin, why are you here today?”

“Nothing much. I’m here to spar with you.” Lin Yun sent a serious look at Jin Xuanyi.

The smile on Jin Xuanyi’s face disappeared completely because he thought Lin Yun had nothing to do and came here to beat him up. After all, both he and Ji Shuxuan weren’t Lin Yun’s opponents, even if they joined forces. If they were fighting one-on-one, he would have no chance at all. He would only be suppressed from the very beginning to the very end because the pinnacle of the firmament sword intent was simply too terrifying.

In Lin Yun’s eyes, his sword techniques were simply filled with flaws unless he also grasps the firmament sword intent, his gold intent reaching the fourth grade, or his Golden Firmament Sword Sutra reaching the sixth stage. Otherwise, he would have no chance against Lin Yun.

“Senior Brother Lin, you must be joking…” Jin Xuanyi awkwardly said.

“I’m not joking at all. To be honest, I want you to punch me a couple of times.” Lin Yun looked at Jin Xuanyi with sincerity.

This made the corner of Jin Xuanyi’s lip twitch as he thought he had misheard him. He looked at Lin Yun and asked, “What are you trying to do here?”

“I want you to punch me a couple of times, like how you shattered my dragon runes back on the Celestial Observing Lake.” Lin Yun replied.

“Senior Brother Lin, stop messing with me. I know that I’m wrong. You can go and look for Ji Shuxuan.” Jin Xuanyi bitterly smiled with his face changed because he really didn’t want to fight Lin Yun.

“I’m afraid that it has to be you!” Lin Yun insisted. His Azure Dragon Saint Art had just reached the eleventh stage, and the dragon runes had undergone a transformation. So he wanted to see if his dragon runes would shatter again under Jin Xuanyi’s attacks. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Golden Firmament Sword Sutra emphasized sharpness. So Jin Xuanyi wasn’t the same as Ji Shuxuan. The latter emphasized explosive power, while Jin Xuanyi emphasized sharpness, which was the bane of his dragon runes. So if he could block Jin Xuanyi’s strongest attack, he wouldn’t have to worry about it when he faced others.

When Lin Yun explained why he was here, Jin Xuanyi inwardly breathed a sigh of relief despite having no change on his face. If Lin Yun really came to give him a beating, there was nothing he could do. Fortunately, Lin Yun wasn’t that bored.

But he looked at Lin Yun with suspicion and wondered if Lin Yun’s physique had become stronger in just a few days. After all, it was relatively easy for him to shatter Lin Yun’s dragon runes previously.

“Here I come, then!” A faint golden aura appeared on Jin Xuanyi with his sword intent wrapping around him.

“Bring it on!” Lin Yun slightly squinted his eyes.

When he was done, Jin Xuanyi charged over and appeared before him with his fist clenched together, radiating like a sword. The air before him shattered like a glacier, with sparks flying around under his punch.

His punch was like a mountain that came crashing over. When Jin Xuanyi’s punch landed on Lin Yun, Jin Xuanyi groaned from the rebound and took ten-odd steps back before stabilizing himself. His face turned pale as he looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.

When he raised his head, he could see Lin Yun was enveloped in a golden-purple light with dragon runes wandering over the surface of his body. Compared to the dragon runes from the past, there weren’t many changes except that the dragon runes had a slight blood mark on them. The blood mark was dazzling and looked like it was alive.

“Senior Brother Lin, you refined the Dragon-Blooded Crystal?” Jin Xuanyi asked as he soon thought of the Dragon-Blooded Crystal.

“You’re smart.” Lin Yun nodded with a smile.

“I’m coming again! I don’t believe I can’t shatter your dragon runes.” Jin Xuanyi’s eyes were filled with disbelief. He couldn’t believe that he couldn’t leave any cracks on Lin Yun’s dragon runes, and he couldn’t believe that the Golden Firmament Sword Sutra was so weak.

As he circulated his Golden Firmament Sword Sutra at the fifth stage, he pushed his palms forth with his aura manifesting into thirty-six swords. When the thirty-six swords flew towards Lin Yun, Jin Xuanyi threw his punch again. But this time, Jin Xuanyi was sent flying away and even threw out a mouthful of blood.

This made Jin Xuanyi surprised as he wiped the blood off his lips. This was because Lin Yun only took two steps back, and there were still no cracks on the dragon runes.

“Again!” Jin Xuanyi wiped the blood off his lips and quickly drew his sword.

When Lin Yun saw this scene, his hands clasped together and the eight thousand dragon runes flew out and coiled around him. As Jin Xuanyi’s sword collided against the dragon runes, sparks flew around, and the dragon runes proved to be as tough as saint artifacts.

After half an hour of attacking later, the dragon runes only became dimmer, but there were no signs of cracks. This made Jin Xuanyi stumped with a grave expression because this was a little unbelieveable. The Dragon-Blooded Crystal was a lot more powerful than he had imagined.

While he was stumped, Lin Yun’s voice resounded, “Go on and use the Skydome 9 Swords!”

The Skydome 9 Swords was a high-grade ghost spirit sword technique. Was Lin Yun going to use his physique to take a high-grade ghost spirit sword technique head-on? This made Jin Xuanyi’s eyes squint and he felt that Lin Yun was a little bloated. He replied, “Is it really necessary?”

“Why don’t I return your question with an attack? I won’t use any martial techniques, only my body-refining technique.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with excitement.

His words made Jin Xuanyi’s eyes flicker as the latter briefly pondered before he replied, “Come at me!”

He really wanted to feel how strong Lin Yun’s body-refining technique was, and he didn’t believe he couldn’t even take an attack from Lin Yun.
