Chapter 1451 - The Tyrannical Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron

Lin Yun inwardly smiled when he heard that because Lil’ Purple was a little child herself.

“Big Sister, Big Sister, come out and play with me. I’ve already seen you, and you’re really beautiful!” The little fatty yelled with his eyes glowing brightly, which made him look pretty adorable, accompanied by his chubby face.

When Lin Yun heard that, he was surprised that the spirit of the stone monument could see through his sword box. Was it because of the stone monument’s power?

But no matter how Stone tried to call out, Lil’ Purple simply ignored him. Lil’ Purple was determined to stay inside the sword box.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word about that and looked at Stone, “Should I just call you Stone?”

“Yeah. You can call me Lil’ Stone.” Perhaps because of Lil’ Purple’s existence, Stone was friendly to Lin Yun. But he couldn’t help feeling disappointed when Lil’ Purple didn’t come out.

“Lil’ Stone, I’m here to comprehend the stone monument. So what do you mean by telling me to stop?” Lin Yun smiled.

“You can just comprehend from where you’re standing and send the jade slip of whatever cultivation technique you plan to comprehend onto the stone monument.”

“I see…” Lin Yun reached out and took out the jade slip with the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra recorded.

Lil’ Stone's face changed when the black jade slip appeared, “The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra! Then you have to back up a little more.”

Although Lin Yun had no idea why Lil’ Stone said that, he followed Lil’ Stone’s advice. So he took three steps back before waving his hand, and the jade slip in his hand flew towards the stone monument.

When the jade slip came in contact with the jade slip, the monument's color changed, going from red, gold, and blue… before turning black and emitting an eerie black light. The aura emitted from the stone monument also changed when the light changed.

Looking at the stone monument, Lin Yun figured something out. Martial Uncle Dustlight said before that any of the nine sword sutras could comprehend the Great Profound Sword Canon at the highest level. This meant that the Great Profound Sword Canon contained all of the sword sutras, and the intent released from it would change accordingly with the different jade slips.

So did that mean that the intent of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra was dangerous, since Lil’ Stone told him to back off a little more? When Lin Yun felt uncertain, waves of black sword intent penetrated his body. Under this erosive power, Lin Yun was shocked to discover that his dragon runes became dim and showed signs of being eroded, like a withering flower after losing its vitality.

“This is the absolute annihilation of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra?” This was simply so bizarre. Lin Yun’s face changed as he continued to retreat. This power could erode astral energy and artifacts, as well as his dragon runes, which was a little too terrifying.

“Well, that’s about it,” said Lil’ Stone. “You can’t retreat too far and must endure the nether energy to grasp the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra before your body erodes entirely. During this period, you’re on your own to see how far you can go.”

His words made Lin Yun furrow his brows because this was a little tough. It was no wonder why Chen Ling said that even Dragon Pulse Realm disciples wouldn’t benefit as much in the Great Profound Palace as other sword sutras. He had a strong physique, but that was only when compared to those in the same cultivation as him. It was a different story if he had to be compared to Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses.

But Lin Yun’s advantage was pretty obvious because he also had the Bodhi Seed. With his heaven-defying comprehension and the Bodhi Seed, it shouldn’t be an issue for him to comprehend the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

“Big Brother, are you sure you want to cultivate the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra? If I remember correctly, few people can reach the greater first stage in the Great Profound Palace. It’s hard even to reach initial mastery.” Lil’ Stone had a kind heart as he continued, “You can leave early if you can’t hold on later.”

“Thank you, Lil’ Stone.” Lin Yun smiled. He realized this little fatty was adorable and didn’t look like the stone monument’s spirit. He soon composed himself and held onto the Bodhi Seed before he stepped forth. Even after taking seven steps forth, he still showed no signs of stopping.

He had already pushed the Azure Dragon Saint Art to the limit, and he could sense his blood boiling with dragon roars echoing from his body. Standing before the stone monument, Lin Yun was like a dragon as he emitted the aura of a ferocious beast with his blood boiling.

When he was less than ten meters away from the stone monument, Lin Yun finally stopped and sat with his legs crossed. When he closed his eyes, a light began to shine from the black jade slip attached to the stone monument before it entered his mind. That was the mantra of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra that was being imprinted into his mind.

As Lin Yun took a deep breath, the Bodhi Seed in his hand shone, and the cryptic mantra became clear in his mind. Simultaneously, his boundless astral energy began to circulate according to the mantra.

The black light that was being emitted from the stone monument was the surging nether energy that was being absorbed into his body. When the nether energy entered his body, it immediately tried to erode it, but it was being blocked by Lin Yun’s boundless vitality.

As Lin Yun circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, he forcibly directed the nether energy towards his ocean of astral energy in his violet palace. As the nether energy entered his violet palace, the cauldron suddenly emitted a great hostility and began to emit a vibrating noise.

A tyrannical destructive energy was pouring out of the cauldron and collided with the nether energy. When the two energies collided within his body, Lin Yun’s body began to tremble. This made his face gradually become pale. When he threw out a mouthful of blood, a black aura was constantly being emitted from his pores. The nether energy he had just refined was being expelled from his body by the cauldron.

“H-How is this possible?!” Lil’ Stone stood up on the stone monument with shock on his face. He had never seen this scene before, so it was beyond his understanding.

But just when he was about to make a move, a voice resounded beside him, “Don’t move. Believe in him.”

“Ah! Big Sister!” Lil’ Stone turned his head and saw Lil’ Purple standing beside him. She wore a white dress with a gold and crimson mark on her forehead, giving her an ethereal and charming temperament.

“Big Sister, you’re different from me…” Lil’ Stone was stumped upon realizing that he had made a mistake. Lil’ Purple wasn’t an artifact spirit. Or, to be exact, she wasn’t a complete artifact spirit.

“Hmph. I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths. How can I be the same as you?” Lil’ Purple indifferently replied.

“Wow!” Lil’ Stone was stunned before his eyes radiated with admiration. But when he turned to look at Lin Yun and saw that the nether energy was swiftly eroding Lin Yun’s dragon runes, Lil’ Stone exclaimed, “Big Sister, what should we do now? Big Brother doesn’t look like he’ll be able to endure it any longer!”

As the nether energy continued to be released from Lin Yun’s body, he didn’t receive any benefits and continued to pay the price. If this continued, it would be impossible for him to practice the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

“Believe in him. This path is his own choice…” Lil’ Purple said calmly. But the concern revealed in her pupils already betrayed her; she wasn’t as calm as she appeared.

Back then, the Iris Sword Saint also had a tough time because of the cauldron, but he ultimately made it through. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to grasp the entire Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon.

Lin Yun was furious as his expression distorted because the cauldron was pushing it. Who did it think he was? How could Lin Yun possibly allow a mere cauldron’s soul to provoke him time and time again and even try to control him?

Now, it took it even further and tried to prevent him from practicing the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra without regard for his life and death. Since when has he suffered like this before he started cultivating?

“You’re courting death!” Lin Yun inwardly roared and rose to the air. He immediately crossed the ten meters between him and the stone monument before placing his hand on it. Since the cauldron wanted to play with him, he would play with the cauldron, then!Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
