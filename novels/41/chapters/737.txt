Chapter 738 - Beast Tide, One In A Thousand Years

The spiritual energy here was so thin that Lin Yun wasn’t even interested in it. Then again, he wouldn’t go into seclusion here otherwise because he was pretty confident that he wouldn’t be disrupted. It was taboo to be disrupted in seclusion as one would run amok.

Lin Yun began to examine Luo Han. Although he had retracted his aura, the glow in his eyes became even sharper. It gave Luo Han a feeling as though he would be severed into two in the next moment. But after a long time had passed, Lin Yun smiled.

This might seem like a desolate mountain to him, but it was perfect for Profound Martial Realm cultivators to train at. Back in Skymound Mountain Range, those he came across were at the level of the seven geniuses. Standing too high made him neglect some things.

It was normal for Luo Han to be in the Profound Martial Realm at his age. After all, monstrous geniuses weren’t found everywhere. Even the weakest genius would be a terrifying existence to those in the Great Qin Empire.

Luo Han had no idea what was going through Lin Yun’s mind. At this moment, he had regretted coming here because he had disrupted a senior that had gone into seclusion. Thinking about it, cold sweat began to flow out as he stuttered, “I-I-I had no idea that you were here. I’ll leave immediately.”

Lin Yun had just reached the pinnacle eleventh stage in the Iris Sword Sutra, giving his Iris Flower one hundred and eight petals. His body was filled with origin energy and he wanted to see how many times he could reverse circulate the Iris Sword Array.

In the end, he circulated it nine times and created the phoenix phenomenon. It appeared that Luo Han was attracted by the phenomenon and came here to try his luck.

“I’m not a senior. My surname is Lin, and I’m two years younger than you,” smile Lin Yun.

“You’re not a senior? Phew, I thought I was about to die…” Luo Han felt relieved before his smile froze. He’s two years younger than me? How is that possible?!

Lin Yun knew Luo Han’s doubts, but he didn’t bother explaining anything and asked, “Are you from somewhere nearby?”

“Yeah. I’m an inner disciple of the Flowing Cloud Sect.” Luo Han answered after he forcibly calmed himself down.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and looked at Luo Han. The Flowing Cloud Sect was probably at the same level as the Sword Firmament Pavilion. In the Great Qin Empire, the Flowing Cloud Sect could be a ruler, but they were insignificant in the Thunder Prefecture. Thinking about it, Lin Yun said, “You’re going down the mountain as well, right? Let’s go together.”

“Okay.” Luo Han had joy written all over his face when he heard Lin Yun’s offer.

The two chatted along the way. Luo Han found out that Lin Yun was only eighteen and he was greatly shocked. For a long time, he heard that those on the Dragoncloud Ranking were monstrous geniuses, so he knew that it wasn’t false when he saw Lin Yun.

At the same time, Lin Yun also knew where he was. He was already out of Skymound City’s boundary and was entering the Swordmire City’s boundary. But he was currently in a rather remote region.

The Swordmire City was also one of the seven cities in Thunder Prefecture, a city filled with many swordsmen. Back in the Falling Dragon Slope, he had ruined Murong Qing’s Imperial Sword Herb. If he remembered correctly, Murong Qing was a genius from the Swordmire City.

If he had enough time, he could pay Swordmire City a visit. But it was a pity that the Draconic Banquet was only three months away, so he didn’t have any extra time. He had to rush back to the Sword Firmament Pavilion unless he decided to join another sect. But clearly, that was impossible.

At the foot of the mountain, just when the two were about to bid their farewell, Luo Han became nervous when he sensed that there was something unusual about Lin Yun, “Young Master Lin, what’s wrong?”

“There’s a loud voice and the ground is trembling.” Lin Yun turned back and said with a grave expression as he looked into the distance. The sky had turned dark with white clouds being chased away.

Not long later, half the sky turned black, and the source of the black smoke seemed to come from Skymound City. Lin Yun wasn’t unfamiliar with the black smoke as he had seen it in many places. “Ominous aura?”

Generally speaking, ominous aura should be locked in secret realms and would rarely leak out. But if it leaked out, it would cause demonic beasts to lose their rationale.

“Not good! It’s a beast tide. I have to return to the sect.” Luo Han’s face changed as he knew that he had to rush back to the sect.

“Your sect should be able to protect itself more or less. There are some villages nearby. Inform them and tell them to head to a huge city.” Lin Yun had never seen a beast tide, but as a swordsman, he was calmer than Luo Han.

Hearing Lin Yun’s reminder, Luo Han instantly realized that the villagers were powerless against such a beast tide.

Right at this moment, the entire mountain trembled with roars echoing all around. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw that the sky had turned dark without him noticing. Lin Yun spoke, “You should leave first.”

“Be careful, Young Master Lin.” Luo Han didn’t dare to delay anymore. But when he got ready to depart, several demonic beasts that were going berserk shot out of the forest. Each one was shrouded in black mist and looked bizarre.

Seeing that the demonic beasts were about to come over, Lin Yun drew his sword. “Luminous Moon!”

In the next second, a moon manifested with his sword energy, slaughtering hundreds of demonic beasts at once. This scene astounded Luo Han. After all, it was too terrifying to kill so many demonic beasts with one sword.

There were Yin-Yang stage elders in the Flowing Cloud Sect, but Lin Yun was on a whole new level. Lin Yun might only be in the lesser Yin-Yang stage, but his sword sutra had reached the pinnacle eleventh stage with his sword intent at complete mastery. Not even someone in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm could defeat him.

Seeing that Lin Yun wasn’t moving, a terrifying thought popped into Luo Han’s mind. Is Lin Yun going to kill all the demonic beasts by himself? This thought startled him as he ran even faster. He had to guide the villagers to a larger city right now.

After Luo Han left, Lin Yun charged towards the demonic beasts. The demonic beasts were influenced by the ominous aura, making them even more ferocious than normal. But if they weren’t at the Yin-Yang stage, it was just a matter of one sword. Even when facing Yin-Yang stage demonic beasts, it was just a matter of another sword.

An hour later, the entire mountain reeked of blood with countless corpses littering the ground. All the demonic beasts were killed by Lin Yun. Standing at the top of the mountain, Lin Yun activated the Aurora Dragon’s Eyes. He could see countless demonic beasts with terrifyingly red pupils.

There were at least a million of them, which startled Lin Yun. A beast tide of this scale was something unheard of. There were only a few thousand demonic beasts in the mountain and there wasn’t even a single demonic beast in the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage. But among the beast tide that he was observing, he saw demonic beasts in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm with overlord and even monarch bloodlines.

Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of those demonic beasts, but it would be troublesome if he got tangled up with them. Lin Yun jumped down the mountain and headed along the path, “I should look for Luo Han first.”

Many people died along the way, all of whom were commoners. Lin Yun shook his head at the brutal scene and continued traveling. It appeared that he could only block one side of demonic beasts. The strength of an individual was insignificant in the face of a beast tide of this scale.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to find the villagers. There were tens of thousands of them running in panic. In addition to Luo Han, there were a few other cultivators protecting them as well as those in the Violet Palace Realm.

Upon seeing Lin Yun, Luo Han rejoiced, “This is Young Master Lin. He’s the one who killed over a hundred demonic beasts with a sword.”

The Violet Palace Realm’s experts all turned to look at Lin Yun. When Lin Yun noticed that they were wandering cultivators, he was surprised.

“Hmph. Are you looking down on us, wandering cultivators? There are many sects’ disciples, but they’re only concerned about their life.” A wandering cultivator said upon seeing Lin Yun’s gaze.

“Sorry about that.” Lin Yun was surprised. Then again, it made sense since they weren’t demonic cultivators. As for the sect’s disciples, one could see just by looking at the seven geniuses. They were even worse than the wandering cultivators.

“We’ll protect them. The nearby cities aren’t safe either. The beast tide is too sudden and the size is unprecedented. We have to protect them in the Swordmire City.” An old man said solemnly. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Yeah, the geniuses of the Dragoncloud Ranking will come after reaching Swordmire City along with Heavenly Soul Realm elders.”

Lin Yun recalled Falling Aquatic Empyrean’s words at this moment that there would be an opportunity. So it turns out that the Falling Aquatic Empyrean wasn’t lying to him!
