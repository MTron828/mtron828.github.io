Chapter 693 - Complete Suppression!

Lin Yun’s feet contained immense power as he stomped down. Even if Xiang Tianhe was in tip-top state, there was no way he could take this attack head-on. When his foot landed, the Azure Dragon energy turned Xiang Tianhe into a pile of minced meat.

After killing Xiang Tianhe, all the negative emotions and thoughts Lin Yun had dissipated because it felt great. There was a warm current flowing through his meridians and muscles with a mist rising out from his skin that made him look majestic.

The moment Lin Yun killed Xiang Tianhe, Lin Yun’s heart throbbed as the Azure Dragon Mark on his chest bloomed. Sensing the warm current flowing through his body, the Azure Dragon Enneaform moved a lot smoother than before. Not only that, but the Iris Flower in his dantian also seemed more bewitching as it emitted a sword buzz that resonated with the dragon roar from his chest.

As Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, he seemed to understand something. It didn’t matter if it was the ancient Azure Dragon or the sword path that he walked on, they both emphasized slaughtering and having a free heart. They were both elegant existences that could neither be humiliated nor bullied.

Ever since he came to Skymound City, he was immediately looked down upon by Qing Ruoyou. Then a group of so-called geniuses began mocking him. The Azure Dragon and Iris Flower couldn’t bear the grievance. If he continued to bear it, it would not only damage his foundation, but it would aslo damage his cultivation on the sword path. So much so that even the Azure Dragon Mark would be weakened. In the end, his energy would go out of control before it searched for a new master.

So the act of killing Xiang Tianhe had resolved his thoughts. The satisfaction wasn’t something that could be described with words. After all, being decisive in killing and resolving grudges was the path he followed. At this moment, he had gained some comprehension as he sensed his sword intent and the Azure Dragon Enneaform.

Meanwhile, the entire plain was quiet, including the geniuses from the other forces. All of them had a shock on their faces as they watched this scene. There was naturally nothing to say for Xiang Tianhe’s strength. Although he wasn’t comparable to the seven geniuses, he was still a genius on the inner ranking.

Relying on his spear technique and cultivation, he was practically invincible among the younger generation. But Lin Yun had stomped him to his death easily like a dog.

“H-how is this possible…” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“I don’t believe it!” Everyone was shocked by this scene because they were still imagining Lin Yun getting suppressed. After all, it was simply too unbelievable that a genius on the inner ranking would be killed by Lin Yun so easily. After today, Xiang Tianhe would no longer exist in the world.

There was news that Lin Yun could suppress a senior in the greater Yin-Yang stage with his cultivation at the pinnacle Yang stage. But that person wasn’t a genius on the Dragoncloud Ranking and the crowd wouldn’t admit Lin Yun’s strength without witnessing it personally.

But now, they had personally witnessed Lin Yun suppress a genius on the inner ranking, even after the seven geniuses said that they would kill Lin Yun if he dared to appear. Not only did Lin Yun appear, but he even gave those geniuses a slap to the face.

Lin Yun first slapped the bowels out of Chen Xiong before he killed Xiang Tianhe with a stomp. Was there really no one who could deal with Lin Yun? Was there no one capable of dealing with Lin Yun except for the seven geniuses?

All the geniuses were filled with grievance and rage, but there was no way for them to vent. Someone had already carried back Chen Xiong and a few seniors of the Chen Clan had a darkened face as they looked at Lin Yun with killing intent.

It was a tactful agreement that no seniors would make a move against the juniors. Otherwise, it would be complete chaos with seniors hunting the juniors of other forces. But they didn’t have such concerns with a genius from the Great Qin Empire.

The reason why they held it back in was that they had a feeling that Lin Yun hadn’t revealed all his trump cards, and they weren’t confident of making Lin Yun stay behind. After all, it would be too humiliating if they failed to make Lin Yun stay behind as it was a simple matter between the younger generation.

Additionally, they had to give Lin Yun the false confidence that they wouldn’t spoil the rules so that they could come up with a plan to kill Lin Yun. The gazes of all the experts were cold.

When Lin Yun sensed their gazes, he quickly became cautious as he had expected it. Judging from the behaviour of the geniuses, how could he not imagine the personality of their senior? He knew that this trip wouldn’t be peaceful.

But this was the Sword Sect’s secret realm and he had no choice but to come since he was a swordsman. His cultivation was lacking compared to his physique, so he needed an opportunity to make a breakthrough. If he could make a breakthrough, it would bring a balance to his physique, sword intent, and cultivation.

If he didn’t, there was no way he could compare to those heaven-defying geniuses during the Draconic Banquet. Glancing at the Sword Sect’s secret realm before him, he knew this was an opportunity for him to make a breakthrough into the Yin-Yang stage.

As Lin Yun emitted a purple radiance with the combination of the nine dragon runes and sword ray, he looked majestic and no one dared to look him straight in the eyes. Countless gazes fell onto Lin Yun as they gnashed their teeth. But there was nothing they could do about it.

For a moment, no one dared to utter a word as Lin Yun soared towards the sword ray. He had a clear objective as he flew towards the Sword Sect’s secret realm.

This made the geniuses of Skymound City enraged as they could only watch Lin Yun head towards the secret realm. Was there really no one who could handle him? Looking at Lin Yun getting closer to the sword ray, everyone became even more furious.

“Sword slave, do you think that there’s no one in Skymound City who can deal with you?” A roar echoed out from Lu Tong. He was ranked third among Skycloud Sect’s core disciples and he gave Xiang Tianhe face in letting him handle Lin Yun. But after Xiang Tianhe was killed, everyone thought that he was fearful of Lin Yun. So when Lu Tong stood up, it was a bright light to everyone’s eyes.

“Hurray to the Skycloud Sect!”

“In the end, we still have to depend on the Skycloud Sect. After all, not every sect can nurture geniuses like Ouyang Hao and Chu Muyan!”

“Kill!”

“Kill that sword slave and wash the humiliation we suffered!” Everyone roared out. They didn’t think that it was a problem. But if someone thought about it carefully, they would realize that Lin Yun did nothing wrong.

All he did was compete with Qing Ruoyou fairly and obtained the Divine Indigo Radiantstone. Just because of that, he was targeted by all the geniuses.

Lu Tong wore a sinister expression with excitement on his face. His heart was beating wildly as he had to admit that Lin Yun was strong. Hearing the voices in the surroundings, he could feel his blood boiling as this was his best opportunity. If he could kill Lin Yun, there was no doubt that he could bring the seven strongest geniuses to eight. Furthermore, he would no longer be outshined by Ouyang Hao and Chu Muyan.

Lu Tong’s eyes lit up as the spear in his hand shined brightly. The spear in his hand wasn’t just beautiful, but it was also the most dangerous weapon. The tip of his spear shining brightly was his strongest attack that he comprehended after going into seclusion for so long.

But Lin Yun was unhappy when he looked at Lu Tong. He knew that if this carried on, he might as well give up on entering the Sword Sect’s secret realm. He could sense numerous killing aura directed at him, wanting to take his life.

With a sinister light flashing in his pupils, a killing aura finally surged within Lin Yun’s heart. The sword box behind him opened as he grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword. He barked, “A bunch of ants trying to shake a tree!”

Circulating the Overlord Sword, a domineering aura exploded out and revolved around him. Suddenly, the domineering aura surged even more as Lin Yun drew his sword. In the next second, the combination of his dragon runes and sword intent soared into the sky.

Then, Lin Yun disappeared. When he reappeared, Lu Tong was severed into two. Sheathing his sword, a roar echoed out from his body that destroyed all the incoming sword rays. When Lu Tong’s corpse fell to the ground, he had already entered Sword Sect’s secret realm.

Simultaneously, all those who were yelling to kill Lin Yun all became silent as Lin Yun’s action was a slap to their faces.
