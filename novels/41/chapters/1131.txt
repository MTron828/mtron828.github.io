Chapter 1132 - Killing with the Flute in the Night of Full Moon

No one expected Lin Yun to show up. After all, no one had ever caused trouble in the Heavenly Star Pavilion’s history. He was causing a ruckus at the worst time. After all, the Heavenly Star Pavilion was on high alert to ensure that the saint artifact wouldn’t get stolen. In fact, they had many spiritual arrays in place to protect it.

However, Lin Yun still managed to break them and descend from the sky. Could it be that the spiritual arrays in the Heavenly Star Pavilion were just for show?

Not even the King Suspend Palace had the guts to provoke the Heavenly Star Pavilion in this manner. After all, it wasn’t just empty words as there was no transaction the Heavenly Star Pavilion didn’t dare to take, and no one the Heavenly Star Pavilion didn’t dare to kill.

Otherwise, the King Suspend Palace would’ve snatched the saint artifact back.

When the entire hall fell silent, everyone’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun with shock. They had no idea why Flower Burial barged into the hall.

“Who is this person?” Ye Ziling couldn’t help looking surprised when she saw Lin Yun descending from the sky. She had to admit that Lin Yun was gutsy to dare to cause trouble in the Heavenly Star Pavilion.

“Senior Sister, that’s Flower Burial. He has been rising in fame recently when you went to the Profound Azure City. Many demonic cultivators who had a grudge with our sect died in his hands. He even injured the Thunderclap Sword Demon.”

“There are rumors that he’s a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but it doesn’t make any sense.”

“He’s very terrifying. Although he carries a sword box behind him, he has only been using his flute and no one had seen him use his sword. Furthermore, no one knows anything about his actual cultivation. He’s very mysterious.”

The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s disciples naturally knew about Flower Burial. After all, rumor had it that he was a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, so it naturally attracted their attention.

“Oh?” Ye Ziling became even more puzzled when she heard that. She was certain that no such person was in the sect. If Flower Burial is here, something big might happen. Thinking about it, Ye Ziling looked at the highest room with killing intent.

“Flower Burial!” Chu Tianhao’s eyes flashed. He couldn’t stand the sight of Flower Burial. He had more killing intent for Flower Burial than he had for Thunderclap Sword Demon. At this moment, he regretted giving his saint artifact to Yan Teng. Otherwise, he could kill Flower Burial right now.

Leng Aoran panicked when he heard the music before he forced himself to calm down. Then, he walked out of his room and looked at Flower Burial, “Why should I be afraid of him in the Heavenly Star Pavilion? I’ll just watch him die!”

The middle-aged man looked at Lin Yun indifferently while countless guards barged into the hall. Once he gave the signal, the guards would bury Lin Yun without hesitation.

“The Heavenly Star Pavilion is where transactions take place. Are you perhaps in the wrong place?” The middle-aged man spoke coldly. He didn’t dare to act rashly because he didn’t know Lin Yun’s identity well.

“What a coincidence. I’m also here to make a transaction,” said Lin Yun. He spoke calmly as if the Heavenly Star Pavilion was an ordinary inn and he was an ordinary customer.

“Haha, what transaction do you want to make?” The middle-aged man smiled indifferently, wanting to see what Lin Yun was trying to play at.

“What about Thunderclap Sword Demon’s head?” Lin Yun replied, staring at the middle-aged man. The moment he said that, it instantly caused an uproar in the Heavenly Star Pavilion. The spectators couldn’t believe Lin Yun’s words.

“There are no transactions that the Heavenly Star Pavilion doesn’t dare to accept, and no one the Heavenly Star Pavilion doesn’t dare to kill… but it’s a pity that you can’t afford his head!” The middle-aged man smiled as he glared at Lin Yun. Those who were familiar with him knew that he was getting angry.

“I’m afraid that you have no choice,” said Lin Yun while raising the flute to his lips.

“Kill him!” The middle-aged man squinted his eyes and retreated to where the saint artifact was. But it was a pity that Lin Yun had already raised the flute to his lips. When the music came out of the flute, the lights went out in the hall and the luminous pearls embedded in the walls shattered.

Before revealing himself, Lin Yun had already examined the spiritual arrays in the Heavenly Star Pavilion. So he naturally knew about the flaws in the arrays or else he wouldn’t dare to break in. Now, the only source of light came from the full moon shining through the hole in the roof.

“Pitiful tricks,” sneered the middle-aged man. All Heavenly Soul Realm cultivators could see in the dark, and the dark was no different from the day for empyreans.

Although the sudden darkness caused some panic, everyone quickly calmed down as they sensed the guards reacting.

Meanwhile, the spiritual array protecting the saint artifact began to crack with a powerful aura spreading out. When the spiritual array crumbled, the saint artifact radiated a silver brilliance and flew away.

No one could maintain their composure anymore and chaos broke out in the hall. Even Chu Tianhao was briefly dazed before light flashed through his pupils and he gave his order, “Go!”

In the next second, two figures charged toward the saint artifact. Chu Tianhao was never a pushover, and he definitely wouldn’t pay a great price to get back his saint artifact if he could snatch it.

This time, the middle-aged man couldn’t maintain his composure. After all, he couldn’t understand why the saint artifact broke free of the restriction.

“Guard the saint artifact! Kill anyone who dares to move!” The middle-aged man roared and even charged toward the saint artifact himself. But the moment he moved, he was obstructed by someone in the dark.

Just like that, the Heavenly Star Pavilion fell into chaos. The guards who were charging towards Lin Yun changed their direction and headed for the saint artifact instead. As astral energy radiated out in the hall, sword rays and sparks flew around. Some people even resorted to using holy spirit martial techniques to seize the saint artifact.

Just like that, the layers of spiritual arrays in the Heavenly Star Pavilion began to reach their limit.

“Who attacked me?!”

“You’re courting death!”

“You bastard! Do you want to die?!” The majority of the people here were demonic cultivators, so they naturally had a vile temper.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun, who was enveloped by the silver moonlight, was neglected by everyone as he continued to play his gentle music. When the middle-aged man swept a glance at Lin Yun, he nearly threw up a mouthful of blood from his rage because he had to protect the saint artifact first.

“Everyone stay here. I’ll be right back!” Ye Ziling’s voice sounded out as everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect watched the chaos.

“Senior Sister!” The shock of chaos soon disappeared as they searched for Ye Ziling, but they couldn’t see her anywhere.

Ye Ziling’s face was cold as killing intent poured out of her eyes. She was running towards the highest room for her target, Thunderclap Sword Demon. However, she wasn’t the only one who was targeting Thunderclap Sword Demon.

Many people were competing to take Thunderclap Sword Demon’s life. However, a sword intent bloomed in the room that Thunderclap Sword Demon was in. Then, a miserable scream echoed out. Based on his scream, it was hard to imagine what kind of torture he was experiencing.

Surprise filled the faces of those that were headed for Thunderclap Sword Demon. Meanwhile, the sword intent surged and reached the sky sword intent’s level in the blink of an eye. However, it didn’t stop there. It continued to rise until it reached complete mastery.

The group targeting Thunderclap Sword Demon felt fear because they knew that they would be caught if they continued to walk forward.

Instantly, the group forgot about their objective. After all, they didn’t know of an individual from the Profound Azure Prefecture who could grasp the sky sword intent to this level. It was simply unheard of. Not even Elysium Core Realm experts had such strong powerful sword intent.

A huge wave was set off in Ye Ziling’s heart as she sensed the sword intent. Her sky sword intent was at complete mastery, but her sword intent paled in comparison. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Is that him?” Ye Ziling saw a silver-haired figure that shined brightly within the chaos. His gentle music was completely opposite of the brutality in the surroundings. Ye Ziling began to suspect that the sword intent in the Thunderclap Sword Demon’s body was planted by the man with the flute.

“Light!” A roar sounded out as the saint artifact fell into the hands of the middle-aged man. Then, light filled the hall as everyone stopped what they were doing. The chaos was coming to an end.

The middle-aged man’s face was dark as he looked at the mess. Many of the auction items were stolen, and the entire hall was in disarray . Seeing this, the middle-aged man could no longer endure his rage, “No one is allowed to leave today! Don’t blame me for being ruthless if anyone dares to disobey!”

When he was done speaking, the highest room suddenly exploded as a decapitated head flew out. It was the head of Thunderclap Sword Demon.

“Consider my song the payment for Thunderclap Sword Demon’s head. After all, the Heavenly Star Pavilion is where business takes place.” Lin Yun opened his eyes after he was done with his song. Then, he smiled and grabbed onto the decapitated head.

Enveloped in the silver moonlight, Lin Yun held onto the flute with one hand and the decapitated head with another. Afterwards, he soared into the sky.

The crowd was dumbfounded. They couldn’t believe that Flower Burial really managed to kill Thunderclap Sword Demon in the Heavenly Star Pavilion. It was even more unbelievable that he was leaving with Thunderclap Sword Demon’s head.
