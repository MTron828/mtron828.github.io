Chapter 1811 - Great Boost in Strength!

The waves were calm on the sea. The Wind Edge Lord’s corpse was floating on the sea, and the radiance given off by the Myriad Scales Armor gradually died down.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun stood on the sea and stowed the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella before heaving out a breath. His act was risky this time because his identity might have been exposed. If the Wind Edge Lord wasn’t dead and escaped, it would bring endless trouble to him.

But after so many times, there was no need for him to keep bearing if he couldn’t. The Wind Edge Lord already came right at his face, and it would make him seem afraid if Lin Yun continued to bear with it. Not to mention that the risk he took this time was worth it.

After killing the Wind Edge Lord, he would be safer in the Black Tortoise Void Sea. Aside from that, he also obtained a Glory Saint Artifact, and that was something Lin Yun hadn’t expected.

The Myriad Scales Armor was composed of silver dragon scales that could merge into his flesh upon wearing it. Not only could it increase his defense, but it could also increase his cultivation and speed. To a certain degree, the value of the Myriad Scales Armor was higher than the Flower Burial Sword.

Then again, the Flower Burial Sword could still be upgraded. In the end, it might end up being a Sovereign Saint Artifact or Divine Artifact, and that was an uncertainty when it came to the Myriad Scales Armor.

When he placed his hand on the Myriad Scales Armor, a warm sensation flowed up. Each scale seemed alive, emitting a terrifying aura. Aside from that, each scale was engraved with a saint rune, and each rune was a miniature spiritual array. This meant there were tens of thousands of spiritual arrays interlocking to form a complicated array to maintain the operation of this Myriad Scales Armor.

“It’s really the scales of pure-blooded true dragons…” Lin Yun was pleasantly surprised. Pure-blooded true dragons were equivalent to Quasi-Divine Beasts, and they’re already extinct in the Kunlun Realm. At the core of this Myriad Scales Armor was a Silver Dragon’s scale, greatly increasing the value of this Glory Saint Artifact.

“Glorymoon Spirit.” Lin Yun briefly observed it and found a Glorymoon Spirit engraved on the core scale.

The seven glory spirits were of different attributes, and he initially thought that Myriad Scales Armor had a Gloryearth Spirit. Since it was the Glorymoon Spirit, it was no wonder why this armor could greatly boost his cultivation and speed.

With a single thought, a hundred thousand golden-purple dragon runes locked onto each scale, and he roared, “Come!”

With a roar, the Myriad Scales Armor was ripped off the Wind Edge Lord’s corpse. When the armor was ripped off, the Wind Edge Lord blew apart and died without even a complete corpse.

Aside from the Myriad Scales Armor, two items fell from the Wind Edge Lord’s corpse. One was his interspatial bracelet, and the other was a black medal.

Lin Yun only skimmed through the bracelet because similar spatial treasures all have restrictions. If he tried to forcibly get past the restriction, the bracelet might explode and he might injure himself because of it.

There was no doubt that the Wind Edge Lord’s bracelet definitely contained a lot of treasures and a large number of Divine Astral Pellets. So it would be a pity to just abandon it.

After a brief pondering, Lin Yun picked up the bracelet. He couldn’t open it, but Lil’ Purple might have a way. As for the black medal, it was weird and contained a cold baleful aura. Just by looking at it, he felt as though he was going to be sucked into it.

He didn’t come in direct contact with it and pulled it over with a suction force. But when he saw the ‘Demonfeather’ engraved on it, his face changed.

“The Demonfeather Order!” Lin Yun’s lip twitched with a cold light flashing across his pupils. This proved that the bounty on his head by the Demonfeather Order was from the Wind Edge Lord. Furthermore, this medal was special, and he couldn’t keep it in the bracelet.

This medal had caused him a lot of trouble, and all the demonic cultivators in the Black Tortoise Void Sea were here for him. Even if they couldn’t find the Black Tortoise’s inheritance, getting his head was a huge opportunity for them.

Lin Yun pondered for a long time, but had no idea what to do with this medal. He ultimately decided to put it away for now because he could make any request with this Demonfeather Order, aside from being a saint. This meant he could even exchange it for a Glory Saint Artifact.

After putting the Demonfeather Order away, Lin Yun examined the Myriad Scales Armor. He could sense that there was a powerful seal on it. This seal should be left by the Wind Edge Lord’s father, and anyone who wanted to keep it for themselves had to erase the seal.

Lin Yun’s face was calm because this was within his expectations. Every Glory Saint Artifact would have a seal left behind by the owner. If someone took his Glory Saint Artifact, they would have to erase the mark left behind by him.

“It will be mine sooner or later.” Lin Yun muttered to himself, and he wasn’t in a hurry.

Right at this moment, a wave of exhaustion swept over him that made him feel dizzy. He fought several Profound Life Stage experts in a row, not to mention he was severely injured, especially after that attack from the Wind Edge Lord.

“If I don’t use my trump cards, I can barely fight with multiple Profound Life Stage experts. But this Black Tortoise Void Sea is filled with Profound Life Stage experts…” Lin Yun stabilized himself before muttering, “Let’s heal my injuries first.”

He sat down and used the Blue Dragon Bone to treat his injuries. As a blue radiance bloomed, the blue dragon runes coursed through his body. He opened his eyes an hour later. He then opened the Nine Lotus Diagram and immediately entered it.

Liu Cheng had long disappeared after so long. When he gently landed on the pond, the nine lotuses began to approach him. He hadn’t been there for long, but he could sense the nine lotuses missed him a lot.

This brought a smile to his face, and he gently caressed the white lotuses. He had a deep impression of these white lotuses because they were like bashful girls when they first came in contact, and they even retreated. But after they became familiar with each other, the lotuses became more intimate with him.

Lin Yun observed, and could tell there was a long way for the lotuses to transform. He came here to verify if Liu Cheng was dead, and he also wanted to go into seclusion here for some time. He was only at the eighth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm now, and he had to expose multiple trump cards to fight Liu Cheng.

If he ran into those with a higher cultivation or those who were in the top ten like Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi, his situation probably wouldn’t be great. Those people were stronger than the Wind Edge Lord, and he heard some even reached the third stage Profound Life Stage. If he didn’t want to expose his trump cards, he might not be able to defeat them.

“It’s up to you, now…” Lin Yun took out a Golden Dragon Bone from his interspatial pouch. This was the one he dug out of Qin Tian.

He dug out the Golden Dragon Bone from the Qin brothers, Qin Tian and Qin Cang. He used the Golden Dragon Bone from Qin Cang to brew soup, and it was a waste. But he planned to use this Golden Dragon Bone well to strengthen himself. If possible, he even wanted to make a breakthrough to the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm and merge the two saint bodies together.

He intended to let the nine lotuses devour the Golden Dragon Bone to nourish him. This was how he could make the best out of it. After all, he didn’t have any method of refining the Golden Dragon Bone, and he couldn’t brew another soup with it.

The woman who rode on the Black Tortoise Ship with Lin Yun finally stepped on the Black Tortoise Void Sea with the young man wearing a bamboo hat. The woman smiled, “Young friend, the Black Tortoise Void Sea is filled with danger, and it won’t be easy to find the Black Tortoise’s inheritance. Why don’t we search together?”

But the youth merely glanced at the woman before he replied, “I’m not interested.”

No one knew if he meant he wasn’t interested in the Black Tortoise Void Sea or the woman. When he landed on the ground, he swiftly disappeared.

After his departure, the woman looked in the distance, and she muttered, “It has been a long time since I was last here, but everything has changed…”

The woman sighed before she swiftly disappeared.

Right then, a figure descended from the Black Tortoise Ship that Lin Yun’s party was previously on with a flute in his hand. This person was naturally Mei Zihua, who lured the vengeful spirits away. When he saw the empty ship, the corner of his lip twitched, “They’re all gone? Can’t they wait for me…”

The boat was pretty lively before he left, but it was empty when he returned. With his strength, he managed to safely lure all the vengeful spirits away, and he was fairly proud of that. He wanted to brag about it to everyone, but everyone left when he returned, and this naturally made him feel uncomfortable.

“What should I do now?” Mei Zihua was depressed, looking in the direction of the Black Tortoise Void Sea. It was fine if others left since he wasn’t familiar with them, to begin with. But Lin Xiao also left. He thought he had a fairly good relationship with Lin Xiao, so it made no sense for him to suddenly leave.

“The Demonfeather Order.” Mei Zihua suddenly thought of something, and smiled, “That fellow should have a bounty on his head by the Demonfeather Order. He didn’t want to drag me down, so this was why he left in a hurry.”

This was a reasonable explanation, but that thought hadn’t crossed Lin Yun’s mind at all. He had simply just forgot about Mei Zihua.

“Don’t worry. You’ve yet to go to the Divine Dragon Empire, so I won’t let you die to the Demonfeather Order.” Mei Zihua smiled as he flew over toward the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

A month later in the Nine Saint Diagram, Lin Yun was enveloped in a golden radiance with a heavenly dragon and divine phoenix coiling around him. Behind him, his dragon pulses were fluctuating like monstrous waves.

If one closely looked at them, one would notice that each dragon pulse had reached a terrifying size of seventeen thousand feet, close to twenty thousand feet!

They might be incomparable to Jian Jingtian, but he was heaven-defying in the Kunlun Realm. The nine lotuses surrounded Lin Yun were emitting pure golden vitality into his body.

Over the past month, the nine lotuses were refining the Golden Dragon Bone and replenishing the vitality back to Lin Yun. His cultivation also improved by leaps and bounds in all aspects.

Suddenly, Lin Yun opened his eyes with a devastating radiance shining from the depths of his pupils. A terrifying aura swept out, and he had now reached the pinnacle of eighth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. He couldn’t even make a wisp of progress in it. Lin Yun let out a breath and felt great.

“I’ll probably have to face my tribulation if I go out now, right?” Lin Yun murmured to himself. He could no longer suppress his cultivation, and he was curious about how terrifying his tribulation would be. Compared to the fear and uneasiness from before, he only considered this to be the life-death experience of a swordsman.

“My Heavenly Dome Sword Intent has long reached greater mastery, but I haven’t experienced enough life-death trials and this is why I can’t make a breakthrough…” Lin Yun stood up, giving off the demeanor of a grandmaster.
