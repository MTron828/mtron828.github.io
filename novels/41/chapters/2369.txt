Chapter 2370 - Change In Situation

Qin Yun suggested that everyone join hands to deal with this Golden-Eyed Demonspirit.

“Agreed!” Heavenly Book said.

“Agreed!” Jiang Ziyao said without any hesitation. He knew that the Blood Conceal King was a formidable opponent, and it was impossible for him to obtain the golden spirit core by himself. They had to join forces to defeat the Blood Conceal King. As for the golden spirit core, that was another matter. Anyhow, the Heavenly Sword Pavilion wouldn’t suffer a loss.

“I have no opinion about it,” Tuoba Hong grinned. “He’s just a demonspirit. We can suppress him if we join forces together. Not to mention that he’s already dead, to begin with.”

Mu Qianxue, Can Jue, and the other geniuses agreed.

“Lin Jiangxian, what about you?” Jiang Ziyao asked, his gaze falling onto Lin Jiangxian with a hint of admiration hidden in the depths of his eyes.

Lin Jiangxian was surprised, but she soon calmed down, and she looked at Lin Yun, “I’m with Flower Burial.”

The faces of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples changed when they heard that, with Jiang Ziyao’s face becoming ugly. He purposely disregarded Lin Yun, wanting to pull Lin Jiangxian to his side and trample on Lin Yun, but who knew that Lin Jiangxian didn’t give him any face and declared that she was with Lin Yun.

Everyone’s faces became playful, and even Heavenly Book looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile, “Young Master Lin, what do you think?”

“I have no opinion about that,” Lin Yun replied.

“Since none of you have any opinions, I’ll make my move! Those who didn’t join in aren’t allowed to compete for the golden spirit core!” Qin Yun made his move because the Blood Conceal King was devouring the golden spirit core while they were talking, and only Qin Yun was decisive enough, not wanting to give the Blood Conceal King time to refine it.

He appeared above the Blood Conceal King with a sword and swung it down. This sword was a Fivespirit Glory Saint Artifact and it unleashed a massive sword ray.

“You’re courting death!” The Blood Conceal King was furious as he dragged two shackles with his hand and blocked the incoming attack. At the same time, he unleashed a soundwave when he let out a roar.

When the sword and shackles clashed, sparks flew. But when the Blood Conceal King’s roar resounded, Qin Yun’s face changed, sensing that something wasn’t right.

The Blood Conceal King was intelligent, knowing where his greatest advantage was, which was his Saint Sovereign’s aura. He fused it into his soundwave to attack Qin Yun’s saint soul, which made the latter let out a groan and he flew away.

At the critical moment, a Yin-Yang Painting appeared beneath him, but it was dispersed by the soundwave when it appeared.

“Let’s go!” Everyone summoned their constellations and charged at the Blood Conceal King.

“You guys stay here while I head over,” Lin Yun said and charged at the Blood Conceal King. Since everyone else made their move, he couldn’t just stand by and watch. Otherwise, he would become the target when competing for the golden spirit core. Most importantly, the Blood Conceal King was tough to deal with, and Lin Yun wasn’t confident that he could take it down by himself.

“Chief, Lin Yun has made a move,” a disciple from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion said to Jiang Ziyao.

Jiang Ziyao turned around and was surprised. Lin Yun was filled with a terrifying saint origin and a primordial aura that didn’t seem like a seventh-stage Saint Lord. Everyone there was an eighth-stage Saint Lord, but he could feel some pressure coming from Lin Yun. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

How did Lin Yun’s cultivation become so powerful? If he remembered correctly, Lin Yun was originally a sixth-stage Saint Lord, and his breakthrough was recent.

Lin Yun charged through the other geniuses and drew the Flower Burial Sword, thrusting at the Blood Conceal King. But golden demonic runes appeared on the Blood Conceal King with a powerful pressure that sent Lin Yun back.

“Golden demonic runes...” Lin Yun frowned, sensing that they were stronger than the silver demonic runes.

The other geniuses sneered when they saw this because sword intent was useless here. But this wasn’t the time to consider that, since the battle was chaotic, and the geniuses here were terrifying. The aura they released suppressed the Blood Conceal King’s Saint Sovereign aura.

But the golden demonic runes were too weird and they failed to injure him. The Blood Conceal King began to brandish the shackles, causing space to distort, and no one dared to be careless.

“Qin Yun, the golden demonic runes are too terrifying,” Heavenly Book said.

Qin Yun said, “The density of the deity’s blood contained within the golden demonic runes is more than ten times stronger than the silver demonic runes, so it’s hard to pierce through his defenses...”

Heavenly Book smiled, “Actually, it’s not that unbelievable. Brother Qin’s Yin-Yang Painting only touched the surface of Yin-Yang Dao. But if it’s an Eternal Dao...”

Qin Yun merely sneered and said nothing. Which genius here didn’t have a trump card? If they had no reservations, they could easily penetrate the golden demonic runes. But if they revealed their trump cards, they would draw the attention of the Blood Conceal King, and they would have to give up on the golden spirit core.

“There’s also another method... We’re all geniuses on the Brandished Dragon Ranking...” Jiang Ziyao and Heavenly Book exchanged gazes and transmitted their voices to everyone else.

Fighting the Blood Conceal King, Mu Qianxue, Can Jue, and the others were surprised. Heavenly Book and Jiang Ziyao’s plan was pretty good, but it was too sinister and everyone’s gazes briefly fell on Lin Yun.

Lin Yun naturally noticed this since his sword intent was keen, and he could guess what they were planning. A ruthless light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes, but he had no change on his face.

Suddenly, a powerful aura swept out from Jiang Ziyao, with his eyes becoming gold. That wasn’t all, four golden flowers then appeared behind him, and the four Sovereign Daos fused into his sword aura. At this moment, Jiang Ziyao looked like a deity’s reincarnation. He roared, “Heavenly Divine Sword!”

Lin Jiangxian was surprised to see that Jiang Ziyao would resort to his trump card. Is he that good-hearted?

Jiang Ziyao charged over and thrust his sword, stabbing at the Blood Conceal King. Fine cracks quickly appeared on the demonic runes.

“Die!” The Blood Conceal King was furious as he turned to glare at Jiang Ziyao.

“A mere soul remnant like you considers yourself a Saint Sovereign?” Jiang Ziyao sneered before he retreated.

“Run? You think you can run?” The Blood Conceal King was furious as the shackles in his hand ignited like two dragons charging over.

Jiang Ziyao sneered as he unleashed a sword ray to knock the two dragons aside. When the dragons landed on the ground, they left behind two craters.

“Kill!” Qin Yun, Tuoba Hong, Heavenly Book, Cang Jue, and Mu Qianxue charged at the Blood Conceal King.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with confusion, and he wondered if he had misunderstood them. After all, they were going all out without holding back.

Lin Yun’s face changed, and he soon joined the fray as well. None of them held back as the golden demonic runes began to crumble. The Blood Conceal King was swiftly being heavily injured as his Saint Sovereign’s aura began to fall.

Seeing this, everyone from the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain heaved a sigh in relief. They had witnessed the strength of these geniuses in this fight. Since they joined hands, even the Blood Conceal King was slowly being defeated.

Just when the Blood Conceal King was about to fall into desperate straits, he became furious, “All of you, die!”

The Blood Conceal King’s aura exploded. Everyone knew that the Blood Conceal King was barely holding on and would die once the time was up.

But Jiang Ziyao, Heavenly Book, Qin Yun, Can Jue, Mu Qianxue, and Tuoba Hong suddenly stopped attacking in unison. Everything happened so quickly that no one could respond to him, and Lin Yun was the only one left to attack the Blood Conceal King.

In the next second, the Blood Conceal King’s rage was focused on Lin Yun. There were seven of them who were bearing the Saint Sovereign’s aura together, but Lin Yun was the only one left now. As for the other six, they had retreated.

Lin Yun was slightly slower, so he became the target. It was too late for him to retract his sword intent and saint energy. The Blood Conceal King had gone insane, venting out all the energy within his body.
