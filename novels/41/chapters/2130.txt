Chapter 2131 - Intense Competition

“Lady Ye, it has been a long time,” Lin Yun calmly smiled and greeted Ye Ziling. But in the eyes of others, Lin Yun’s smile looked weird. Aside from Zhao Yan, everyone looked at Lin Yun with an ill gaze because Ye Qingtian was too famous. Everyone within the Sword Sect knew his nickname, the Holy Maiden Killer.

Before Ye Ziling could reply, Ye Ziyun dragged her to the side and looked at Lin Yun with a smile, “Ye Qingtian, why did you come to the True Dragon Secret Realm and not the Azure Dragon Secret Realm? Don’t tell me that you’re here for Ye Ziling?”

Lin Yun glanced at the fellow senior brothers and sisters whom he once shared life-and-death in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. But now, they were looking at him strangely. There wasn’t any hostility from them, but there was a hint of defensiveness.

This was because they wanted to protect Ye Ziling, and they secretly told her to be careful of the Holy Maiden Killer.

But Ye Ziling didn’t take their words to heart, and she asked, “Ye Qingtian, do you want to come to the True Dragon Palace with us?”

Lin Yun glanced at the True Dragon Palace, which was enveloped in a seven-colored radiance. There should be treasures inside, but regardless of the treasures, it wouldn’t be able to compare to his harvest since this was only the True Dragon Secret Realm. Since he confirmed that those from the Sword Sect were safe, he would shift his focus to making a breakthrough. He shook his head and said, “I’ll not be coming along.”

“Those from the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking are here,” Mu Xueqin said.

Lin Yun watched as Xiao Hongfei, Fang Haotian, Cao Yang, Mo Li, and those on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking arrived. They gave off a powerful aura that instantly caused a commotion. Many people didn’t expect so many experts to show up in the True Dragon Secret Realm.

At a glance, at least ten-odd people were on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking. Within the entire Kunlun Realm, the number of countless geniuses exceeded tens of millions. But the hundred on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking were the strongest 100 people amongst the younger generation in the current Divine Dragon Era. So even if Ye Qingtian was ranked at the bottom, there was a huge gulf between them and ordinary geniuses.

“The dragon aura has weakened, so we can enter the True Dragon Palace now!” Someone yelled, and everyone lost their patience as they charged towards the mountain. They all released a dazzling saint radiance as they charged forth.

“Everyone, be careful! We’ll meet again after you leave the True Dragon Secret Realm!” Lin Yun cupped his fists at those from the Sword Sect before he headed in a certain direction.

“Why doesn’t Ye Qingtian seem like the rumors?”

“Yeah. He’s rumored to be arrogant and not placing anyone in his eyes, not even the Blood Moon Divine Son. But he seems amicable to me.”

“That’s weird. Why does his tone sound a little familiar?” After Lin Yun left, everyone from the Sword Sect spoke up.

Mu Xueqin looked at Ye Ziling, and she said, “Junior Sister Ye, do you know something? He’s a saint disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect but seems overly concerned about us.”

Gongsun Yan grinned, “Don’t think too much about it. He’s the infamous Holy Maiden Killer. He asked me and Zhao Yan about Senior Sister Ye’s news earlier. That fellow isn’t bad, but he’s too lecherous.”

Hearing what Gongsun Yan said, everyone burst into laughter as they calmed down.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

But for some reason, Ye Ziling was inexplicably touched by those words because Lin Yun first thought of her in the True Dragon Secret Realm. She recollected herself, and she said, “Remember. Leave the True Dragon Palace immediately if we run into danger, and don’t be greedy.”

Everyone headed to the True Dragon Palace while Lin Yun went in the opposite direction. It didn’t take long for the surroundings to be emptied.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun arrived in a valley.

“This place isn’t bad. You have three days left, so it should be enough time. I’ll guard you and ensure your safety.” Lil’ Purple came out from the Iris Secret Realm and examined the surroundings before she began to set up a spiritual array. This was because the True Dragon Secret Realm was still dangerous, and it would be troublesome if demonic beasts found their way here while Lin Yun made his breakthrough.

Lin Yun took out the Golden Cauldron Herb. This was a complete saint herb with a Golden Cauldron Fruit at the top and ancient dragon and phoenix runes engraved on it.

“Don’t refine it directly.” Lil’ Purple jumped and continued, “You might not be able to bear the power of the innate saint fruit with your current cultivation. So consume it instead to make a breakthrough in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. If you make a breakthrough in it, it will be easy for you to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm.”

The power of the innate saint fruit was too powerful, containing too much spiritual energy within it. So, using it to make a breakthrough to the Quasi-Saint Realm was too much of a waste. But it was perfect to make a breakthrough in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon with it, not to mention Lin Yun could even refine the essence of Dragon’s Blood within it.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he came to his senses. His Divine Firmament Sword Sutra had already reached complete mastery, and he could only practice the Great Profound Sword Canon if he wanted to take it a step further. On the other hand, his Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon had been stuck at the sixth stage for a long time.

“Alright.” Lin Yun agreed because Lil’ Purple’s suggestion wasn’t bad. But the pressure was a little great if he wanted to make a breakthrough in three days.

Lil’ Purple naturally noticed that Lin Yun was concerned, and she smiled, “Don’t worry. It’ll be easier for you to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm than the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.”

“Mhm?” Lin Yun was baffled.

Lil’ Purple said, “I have already mentioned this is an innate saint fruit. So you don’t have to be afraid that you can’t make a breakthrough and only have to be concerned if your physique can withstand it. This fruit can even be used to make a breakthrough to the Saint Realm. So, reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm is nothing. You have no idea how precious an innate saint fruit is, and it’s ridiculous for it to appear within the True Dragon Secret Realm.”

“It's that powerful?” Lin Yun was baffled, before he asked, “Aren’t I a little too lucky?”

“I’m not concerned about your luck. Even all the True Dragon Palace treasures might not be comparable to an innate saint fruit and the Eternal Saint Coffin. So it’s normal…” Lil’ Purple shook her head.

“Well… That does seem like the case.” Lin Yun hadn’t carefully thought about it before. So now that he thought about it, his luck did seem a little too terrifying.

“It might be related to that Saint Elder. Do you remember that she glanced at you before opening the secret realm? The Dao Yang Holy Son said that the time was already up, but she didn’t begin and even said she was waiting for Flower Burial.” The more Lil’ Purple shared her speculation, the more she felt that her speculation was right. Her eyes shone brightly, and she said, “That must be it! She planned this for you! Hmph, when did you form such a close relationship with her for her to be so concerned about you?”

“I didn’t… Don’t ramble nonsense.” Lin Yun quickly denied it, but he couldn’t help feeling guilty. Now that he thought about it, Mu Xueling took great care of him, and it should be because of Yue Weiwei.

“Hmph, you scumbag,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly. His rationale told him not to continue this topic with Lil’ Purple. As a dragon’s roar and a phoenix’s cry echoed, Lin Yun executed the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon and the heavenly dragon and divine phoenix flew out from his violet palace.

He sat with his legs crossed and the innate saint fruit hovering between his palms. As he circulated the sword canon, a boundless nirvana aura formed into a vortex between his palms, devouring the energies within the innate saint fruit.

In the next second, the nirvana aura within Lin Yun’s violet palace exploded with a powerful energy filling his body, causing his hair to flutter violently. A powerful radiance also shone from within his body through his pores.

“This is the innate saint fruit?” Lin Yun was startled by this scene because he nearly blew up. Fortunately, he possessed a divine physique, even if it was only at the initial stage. If he still possessed his two sword physiques, his skin and flesh might tear apart from the energies. At this moment, Lin Yun knew what Lil’ Purple said was right.

“Rise!” Lin Yun roared as the accumulated nirvana aura within his violet palace exploded, forming into a violent energy that swept out of the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron.

“Devour!” Lin Yun controlled the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron to devour the energies of the innate saint fruit. It didn’t take long for the radiance from his pores to settle down, and the energies within his body gradually calmed down.

“That’s more like it,” Lin Yun smiled as he calmly circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon to make a breakthrough.

As time passed, a few days passed in the secret realms. But it wasn’t long in the outside world because seven days were barely two incense sticks of time. One incense was already done burning, and the second incense was halfway through. Simultaneously, more people also began to exit the secret realm.

"Holy shit. The Divine Dragon Secret Realm is that good? Everyone has gotten much stronger after coming out.”

“Look at that saint disciple from the Ming Cult. A phenomenon accompanies his appearance, and it still hasn’t dissipated.”

“I heard that those from the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking are starting a massacre in the secret realm, and no one can stop them. Just how powerful will they become after coming out?”

“The little princess of the Divine Phoenix Mountain is out! The flames blazing from her is the Phoenix Sacred Flame, right? It’s too dazzling!”

“The Dao Yang Holy Son is also out, and the radiance coming from him is as bright as the sun!”

“Mu Qianjue, the champion of the Fourth Heavenly Path, has come out. Just what did they obtain inside? They didn’t bother concealing themselves. Do they all think that they can suppress this entire era?”

“This is too terrifying…” As more cultivators emerged from the various secret realms, they shone brightly like stars, all radiating a powerful aura.

They all seemed to have a huge harvest in the secret realm. They all became much stronger than before, which looked like geniuses from ancient times were reborn.

“Haha. It looks like the Blue Dragon Record will be grand.” The woman standing beside Mu Xueling looked satisfied when she saw this. She was an official sent by the Empress, a first-grade official in charge of ceremonies. She might be a woman, but she had high authority and an unfathomable cultivation. Her name was Zi Ling, and she was responsible for helping with the Blue Dragon Record. Her eyes were shining brightly as she looked at all the geniuses beneath her. Her voice was ethereal and perfectly fused with her temperament.

Mu Xueling didn’t say a word as she looked at the mountain belonging to the True Dragon Secret Realm. The cultivators climbed up the mountain when they came out of the secret realms. The Dragon’s Head, Dragon’s Claw, Dragon’s Torso, and the Dragon’s Tail. Each mountain could accommodate nine hundred people on the Blue Dragon Record, and everyone would be ranked accordingly.

While they could leave their names on the Blue Dragon Ranking, no one would want to remain at the Dragon’s Tail. Thus, they began to compete among themselves.

“Why is the Saint Elder paying attention to the True Dragon Path? The true dragon is nothing compared to the other dragons. Golden-generation geniuses with a backbone wouldn’t go to the True Dragon Path. Even if they could leave their names, it would humiliate them.” Zi Ling said she paid more attention to those who entered the Divine Dragon Secret Realms, not the True Dragon Secret Realm.

Mu Xueling didn’t speak with her, but indifferently said, “The True Dragon isn’t insignificant. The legendary Heavenly Dragon used to be amongst those you looked down on.”

“As you said,” Zi Ling smiled. She respected Mu Xueling and didn’t want to argue with the latter. But even if she was wearing a smile, the contempt within her eyes didn’t diminish.

The second incense was about to finish burning, and almost all the geniuses had come out. The champions of the eight heavenly paths have appeared, competing on the Divine Dragon Paths. But the person Mu Xueling had been waiting for hadn’t appeared, which naturally baffled her. She wondered if Lin Yun was trapped inside the True Dragon Secret Realm.
