Chapter 2082: Fight!

“We’ll leave immediately?” The Indigo Thunder Peak Master looked at Lin Yun with a surprised gaze.

Lin Yun nodded, “Even the teleportation array was secretly destroyed, which means that the branch is no longer safe. We might have to leave the city and see who’s behind it.”

It was outrageous for the teleportation array to be secretly destroyed. Even if Feng Wuji didn’t know about it, someone must be unhappy with him in Hidden Sword Manor, and the branch might be unable to protect them. So they might as well leave the city. Lin Yun was still confident about leaving as long as a Saint Realm expert didn’t interfere in the fight. But if a Saint Realm expert made a move, that saint must face the wrath of his two mistresses.

“Let’s go. Let me see who’s behind this. My Heavenly Dao Sect isn’t a pushover. either.” Lin Yun seemed calm, but his eyes were radiating with murderous intent.

This made the Indigo Thunder Peak Master stumped because he didn’t notice when Ye Qingtian came to possess the temperament of a leader that even made his blood boil with his speech.

“Alright!” The Indigo Thunder Peak Master laughed. “Well said! This Indigo Thunder Peak Master isn’t a pushover, either. Since you’re not afraid, what do I have to be afraid of?”

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master felt like he had returned to his youth, fearless and enthusiastic. The two looked at each other with a smile before they left the branch.

The destruction of the teleportation array also affected the other forces from other regions. They were forced to leave the city and head to the nearest teleportation array, the Southern Border’s Sacred Alliance, which was open to anyone as long as they could fork out sufficient resources. There were many people on the streets heading in the same direction.

“Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint.” It didn’t take long for them to bump into the Sword Sect’s party, Mu Chuan and the disciples. They seemed to have been waiting for a long time.

“Let us go together,” Mu Chuan said, glancing at Lin Yun.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master was stunned before he smiled, “Forget it. We’ll likely run into trouble later, and I’ll not implicate the Sword Sect in it.”

“It’s fine. We’re from the Eastern Desolation and should unite when outside,” Mu Chuan smiled.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master turned to look at Lin Yun. When he saw Lin Yun nodding, he replied, “Alright, let’s go together, then.”

Mu Chuan was the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple and a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase. So the Indigo Thunder Peak Master was naturally happy to have such an ally.

“The Sword Sect and Heavenly Dao Sect are walking together. They’re not afraid of death.”

“Someone is clearly after Ye Qingtian’s Sovereign Saint Sword since they destroyed the teleportation array.”

“That’s for sure. That’s the Cauldron Sword that we’re talking about. You have no idea how many forces are tempted by it. They can’t do anything within Hidden Sword Manor, but it’s a different story outside Nether Ethereal City.”

Seeing the Sword Sect and Heavenly Dao Sect together, many people shook their heads. If they weren’t afraid of the Heavenly Dao Sect, they might not have been able to hold themselves back from the temptation. But this wasn’t the Eastern Desolation, so the Heavenly Dao Sect couldn’t intimidate some of them.

When Lin Yun and the Sword Sect were a few hundred miles away from Nether Ethereal City, they were stopped by a group of people, and the formation was shocking. The party was led by the Black Plume Palace, one of the three immortal holy lands, followed by elders and disciples of the Misty Rain Manor, Aquamoon Sword Mountain, and the Soaring Cloud Sect. Aside from them, seven holy lands were scattered about, hovering in the sky, riding demonic beasts, or riding ships.

“Ye Qingtian, do you think you can safely leave after killing a sword servant of mine?” A cold voice resounded. It came from Zhao Wuji, who led the elders and disciples of the Black Plume Palace.

The faces of the Sword Sect’s disciples changed when they saw this scene. It was no coincidence that the teleportation array was destroyed. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Looking at the party before him, Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of the pressure they gave off because of his Astral Sword Intent. Lin Yun said, “It’s natural for death to occur in a fight.”

“How dare you! The sword servants of my Black Plume Palace are top-tiered geniuses, nurtured with countless resources. Who do you think you are to kill them? Are you disregarding the Black Plume Palace?!”

“Why waste time with him? Just kill him and make him pay with his life!”

“Let’s just cripple him first. Did he really think this is the Eastern Desolation? This is the Sword Alliance’s home ground!” The Black Plume Palace wasn’t an entirely righteous force, and several Quasi-Saints were coldly looking at Lin Yun.

They already had a plan and had no intentions of letting him go. So him killing a sword servant was only an excuse that they came up with.

“Since when has the Sword Alliance bullied my Heavenly Dao Sect’s geniuses?” A powerful aura swept out as the Indigo Thunder Peak Master coldly looked at the group that stopped them. He was a Quasi-Saint at the pinnacle Heavenly Origin Phase and was only one step away from stepping into the Saint Realm.

The Black Plume Palace’s Heavenly Origin Phase Quasi-Saint coldly said, “The Heavenly Dao Sect is no longer the same as it was in the past. Do you still think we are the same from three thousand years ago?”

Mu Chuan stood out, standing side by side with the Indigo Thunder Peak Master, and he sneered, “I have long heard that the Black Plume Palace is both evil and good, having a close relationship with the Demon Gate. It looks like it’s true. Just be blatant about it if you want the Sovereign Saint Sword, why bother finding an excuse for it?”

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master released his aura and roared, “If anyone dares to make a move today, it’ll be a life-and-death feud. My Heavenly Dao Sect won’t forget about it!”

“You think you can represent the Heavenly Dao Sect? Killing him is as easy as killing a dog for me. Ye Qingtian, come here!” The Black Plume Palace’s Heavenly Origin Phase elder waved his hand and released his sacred flame. As he waved his hand, a powerful aura swept out that dragged the space around Lin Yun over.

Lin Yun felt like he had lost weight and was about to lose control. But in the critical moment, the Azure Dragon Sword Heart gushed out with a silver radiance shining out and shattered the suction force.

The Black Plume Palace’s elder frowned and released even more of his aura. This time, the heaven and earth shook, and the power he released this time was a few times stronger than before.

“How dare you! Get lost!” The Indigo Thunder Peak Master roared, stepping forth and releasing his saint aura. When he stood before Lin Yun, the Black Plume Palace’s elder couldn’t do anything to Lin Yun, no matter how he released his aura.

“You’re courting death!” The Black Plume Palace’s Quasi-Saint roared because he noticed the Sovereign Saint Sword behind Lin Yun.

He rose out of nowhere and made a move first. When his sacred flame gushed out, it was like a dazzling sun that changed the surroundings. This palm of his could easily destroy mountains and rivers.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master snorted with his hair fluttering. He leaned forth and countered with a palm of his. When the two palms clashed together, a powerful shockwave swept out that tore the clouds within thousands of miles apart.

The terrifying aura from their clash sent many people beneath the Quasi-Saint Realm away, including Lin Yun. The saint aura in their clash included their sacred flame and saint dao.

“The Heavenly Dao Sect and Black Plume Palace clashed!”

“What the hell? Eleven holy lands have joined forces to seal the path, with the Black Plume Palace standing out. Do they intend to snatch the Sovereign Saint Sword by force?”

“Isn’t that obvious? How can the Sword Alliance possibly let the Sovereign Saint Sword be taken away so easily?”

“Speaking of which, even I’m tempted to snatch it away. After all, it’s a Sovereign Saint Sword we’re talking about.”

“The Heavenly Dao Sect has declined without a sect master. If it was three thousand years ago, who would dare to bully them?”

“It looks like the damage to the teleportation array wasn’t a coincidence. Only the Black Plume Palace would dare to do something like this since they’re a demonic sect.”

“Ye Qingtian is doomed. Quasi-Saints have joined forces, wanting to take his life!” This place was spacious, so there were many forces in the surrounding area, and they were shocked when they saw this scene.

“Let’s go!”

“Kill him quickly!”

“Kill that brat and snatch the sword!” The Black Plume Palace dispatched four Heavenly Origin Phase, eight Indigo Origin Phase, and ten-odd Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints. They had dispatched all the forces that they had in their branch to ensure their success. It appeared that they didn’t intend to give up and even intended to kill Lin Yun just for the Sovereign Saint Sword.

“Sword Sect, listen up, protect Ye Qingtian!” Mu Chuan roared as black flames burst out around him. The surrounding area suddenly became lifeless.

Lin Yun turned around to look at Mu Chuan and could feel that his blood was boiling. The Sword Sect had gone all out to help him again. Mu Chuan was strong, facing two opponents by himself. Not only that, he even blocked several Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints, and his opponents were fearful of his saint aura that was mixed with nether energy.

The nether energy formed into a giant sword, knocking back two Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints who were sneaking around.

“Brother Mu, impressive!” The Indigo Thunder Peak Master laughed and released an indigo radiance from him, forming into a moon.

This shocked the other forces when they watched the battle. But they were fortunate that they were only responsible for sealing the path of retreat. Even the Misty Rain Manor, Aquamoon Sword Mountain, and the Soaring Cloud Sect only had to watch from the side and didn’t have to join in.

Even so, the huge formation was shocking enough as ten-odd Quasi-Saints clashed, including the disciples from both sides.

“Ye Qingtian, die!” An Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saint charged at Lin Yun, pushing his palm forth. His saint aura caused the ground to collapse, which surprised Lin Yun.

The attack came too suddenly, and Lin Yun didn’t have the time to draw his sword. Thus, Lin Yun could only execute the Divine Sunchasing Art to retreat.

“You think you can escape?” That Quasi-Saint laughed. His cultivation was at the pinnacle Azure Origin Phase, and he was over a hundred years old with a huge storage of saint aura. So when he attacked at full power, Lin Yun had no choice but to dodge the incoming attacks.

“Ye Qingtian, catch!” Ye Ziling seemed to notice something and her gaze became complicated. She threw out the White Dragon Sword over to Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun turned around, he looked at Ye Ziling, and his gaze also became complicated as he recalled the past. Before Lin Yun could come to his senses, he held onto the White Dragon Sword. This sword was a Dragon Clan’s treasure that he gave to Ye Ziling.

But just when Lin Yun was worried about the sword, a terrifying black sword ray gushed out from the mysterious ‘broken sword’ in his body and poured into the White Dragon Sword. If it was in the past, the White Dragon Sword would’ve snapped by now. But this time, Lin Yun was surprised to discover he could control this ‘black sword ray’ to empower the sword.

Truth be told, the White Dragon Sword was even weaker than the Flower Burial Sword. But when he held onto it, he discovered that it had perfectly matched his Blue Dragon Bone and saint physiques. As the sword gave off a powerful sword ray, he brought out almost the entire power of this sword.

“Good sword!” Lin Yun rejoiced. After all, it was hard for anyone to unleash the full power of a Glory Saint Artifact before reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm, but it didn’t seem to be the same with the White Dragon Sword. When he poured his Astral Sword Intent into the sword, a dragon’s roar echoed with a white dragon flying out from the sword. It soared to the sky, releasing a powerful dragon aura, and sending the incoming Quasi-Saint flying away.

“It’s just a Dragon Clan’s saint sword. What’s there to be cocky about?” The Quasi-Saiunt grinned as he summoned his constellation, unleashing his saint aura like a tidal wave in Lin Yun’s direction.

“It’s more than enough to kill you!” Lin Yun held the White Dragon Sword and could feel a bloodline connection with the sword. As a dragon aura exploded from him, he dashed over to the Quasi-Saint without hesitation.
