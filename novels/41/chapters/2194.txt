Chapter 2195: Gentleman’s Sword, the Nether Orchid Courtyard (2)

Everyone from the Ye Clan who were attacking at the Nether Orchid Sword Array quickly dodged because it would be hard to extinguish the Nether Sacred Flame if they came in contact with it. When the black flames landed on the barrier, black miasma began to rise from the barrier, and it soon left multiple holes.

In the Nether Orchid Courtyard, the Nether Orchid Flowers began to wither, and the massive Nether Orchid Sword Array began to break apart with a huge hole appearing on the array.

“Father, is it time to use the cauldron now?” The Stun Yang Saint Lord asked nervously. The Heavenly Flame Cauldron was the Sovereign Saint Artifact of the Ye Clan, and they brought it with them as a trump card against the Nether Orchid Sword Array.

The Stun Yang Saint Sovereign was confident in the Heavenly Flame Cauldron, and he once used it to injure a Great Saint.

Lin Yun also had a Sovereign Saint Artifact, but the Heavenly Flame Cauldron was much stronger since it’s under the control of a Saint Sovereign.

“There’s no need to hurry,” the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign said. He could see that the Nether Orchid Flower’s petals were swiftly recovering, and the Absolute Nether Saint Sovereign hadn’t brought his trump card out yet, so they still had to wait. They had to wait till the Nether Orchid Sword Array reached the low point before launching a fatal attack at it.

“Nether Annihilation!” The Absolute Nether Saint Sovereign roared as all the petals of the Netherflower closed up. Not long later, a massive blackhole that looked like a vortex appeared.

Beads of sweat appeared on the Absolute Nether Saint Sovereign’s forehead. It was taxing for him to execute an attack of this level. As his saint aura fluctuated within his body, his dao flowers began to bloom, and a terrifying aura swept out, causing all lives to tremble. This was pure destruction, the aura of death.

As the black vortex slammed against the energy dome, a loud explosion swept out that caused the surrounding mountains to collapse.

The Nether Orchid Flower swiftly began to wither. In just a brief moment, the radiance released from the bud of the Nether Orchid Flower became dim.

“Heavenly Flame Cauldron!” The Stun Yang Saint Sovereign couldn’t wait any longer. He soared to the sky and released an ancient cauldron.

From beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven, an ancient Sovereign Constellation sensed the Heavenly Flame Cauldron as flames manifested into a divine beast and broke through the thirty-six layers of heaven. This was the legendary ancient ominous beast, the Bale Vermillion.

As it’s claw reached and broke through the thirty-six layers of heaven, starlight shone through the hole with an ancient and terrifying aura spreading out, putting the entire Heavenly Dao Sect under a great pressure.

The Bale Vermillion grabbed onto the Heavenly Flame Cauldron with its claw. The moment it came into contact with the cauldron, the runes on the cauldron lit up, erupting with flames as the cauldron smashed against the flower bud of the Nether Orchid Sword Array.

As sparks flew around, the flames from the Heavenly Flame Cauldron exploded before descending on the Nether Orchid Courtyard. When the flames came in contact with the ground, everything began to burn as the flames continued to spread.

This scene gave the appearance of the arrival of the apocalypse, and the Nether Orchid Courtyard instantly fell into chaos with fine cracks on the energy dome that swiftly spread out.

Stun Yang Saint Sovereign bore the pressure and slammed the Heavenly Flame Cauldron against it once more, and the crack widened on the dome. At the same time, many buildings in the Nether Orchid Courtyard began to collapse, making Bai Shuying’s face change with shock.

Seeing this, all the Saints from the Ye Clan rejoiced because the Nether Orchid Sword Array was finally broken. They cheered with excitement because the Nether Orchid Sword Array had stopped them for a long time, and they were long furious with it.

Right then, the Sword-Bearing Elder of the Nether Orchid Courtyard soared to the sky, and said, “The Nether Orchid Flower blooms for eternity!”

Very quickly, countless forces came from the darkness, responding to the elder’s words.

“Nether Orchid Flower blooming before the courtyard, gently waiting for a breeze.”

“Righteousness exists in heaven and earth, and we will not cower!”

“Gentleman’s Sword, the Nether Orchid Courtyard!” Everyone soared to the sky as they shone brightly like stars, and the Nether Orchid Flowers that had withered on the ground bloomed once more. An awe-inspiring righteousness swept out from their bodies, gushing towards the flower bud.

The Heavenly Flame Cauldron was about to fall for the third time, but it was repelled this time and the Stun Yang Saint Sovereign suffered a backlash because of it, throwing out a mouthful of blood.

“Righteousness exists in heaven and earth, and we will not cower!” Voices kept echoing from the Nether Orchid Courtyard with righteous auras spreading out. Their righteousness supported the Nether Orchid Sword Array once more.

“You want to break the array of my Bai Clan? Dream on!” Within the main hall, the Bai Clan’s ancestor wore a smug on his face, and the other elders from the Bai Clan also smiled as well. They knew that it was safe now since the Ye Clan couldn’t break through the Nether Orchid Sword Array, even after using a Sovereign Saint Artifact. This meant that the Bai Clan could just sit back and reap the benefits.

The Seven Feather Saint Lord, who wanted to protect Bai Shuying earlier frowned, and said, “A swordsman must have their fangs, and the Nether Orchid Sword Array is the glory left behind by our predecessors. So we have to display our edge, or there will be trouble sooner or later if we only focused on defending.”

In fact, he had suggested very early on to retaliate and not just hole up in the Nether Orchid Sword Array. The Nether Orchid Sword Array was powerful, and only blood and massacre could unleash the full power of this ancient array.

They managed to guard the Nether Orchid Courtyard now, but it was at the expense of the Bai Clan’s younger generation releasing righteous aura at the expense of their lives.

“Stop messing around. Even the Heavenly Flame Cauldron can’t break the Nether Orchid Sword Array, so this means that the ancestor’s plan is correct. We just have to defend and continue dragging it out with them. The longer we drag it out, the more beneficial it will be for us.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“That’s right. If we take the initiative to attack, we might expose our flaws.”

“If the ancestor is injured, we would all be finished,” the other Saint Elders reprimanded the Seven Feather Saint Lord.

The Bai Clan’s ancestor smiled, “Seven Feather, let’s put an end to it here. We’re holding the advantage now, and the Ye Clan’s old goat will soon reveal his flaws from anxiety.”

“If the ancestor isn’t willing, I am willing to preside over retaliating with the array,” the Seven Feather Saint Lord said.

The Bai Clan’s ancestor unhappily frowned, and coldlly said, “Why are you so stubborn? I have already put up with you when you spoke out for that lass earlier, and yet you still speak rubbish now? Are you a traitor?”

“It might be true. We held our ground well, and he wants us to retaliate. He clearly wants us to expose our flaws.”

“The Seven Feather Saint Lord seems anxious. The ancestor isn’t willing, and yet you want to go by yourself? Don’t tell me that you want to destroy the array?” The Bai Clan’s Saints looked at the Seven Feather Saint Lord unhappily with indifference in their eyes.

This scene made the Seven Feather Saint Lord’s heart become cold, but he no longer spoke. Right then, fine cracks appeared on the ground of the main hall as the entire hall began to tremble.

At the same time, the northwest of the Nether Orchid Courtyard shone like the day, looking as though time and space had collapsed.

“What’s going on?” All the Saints in the main hall instantly became nervous as they flew out and landed on the roof of the main hall.

But when they saw the scene in the distance, they were stunned with their mouths wide open. “H-How is this possible?!”
