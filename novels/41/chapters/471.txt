Chapter 472 - Not Frowning Before Death!

Lin Yun and Xin Yan made their way to the Sword Burial Woods. A corpse laid on a nearby rock that emitted a chilling air. However, the corpse didn’t really look like a corpse and it simply looked like the person was asleep.

“Big Brother!” Xin Yan couldn’t control her tears anymore when she saw Xin Jue’s corpse. This was the first time she had seen Xin Jue’s body since he died. She had been trying to avoid it in her heart and she only dared to face her brother now that Lin Yun had become the champion. She wanted to tell her brother the news, even if he could no longer hear anything.

Looking at Xin Jue’s corpse, Lin Yun’s face turned grave as he recalled how Xin Jue died to save him.

A memory played in Lin Yun’s mind. “You have to be more careful in the future.” Xin Jue smiled and stretched his hand out. However, Lin Yun didn’t understand why Xin Jue was saying that.

“Looks like someone doesn’t want me to appear in the Dragon Gate Competition. But no matter what, Junior Brother, you’ll attend the Dragon Gate Competition, right?” Xin Jue gave Lin Yun a casual smile.

“Of course. I will surely attend the Dragon Gate Competition,” replied Lin Yun.

“Big Brother, there’s something on your forehead,” smiled Xin Yan as she looked at Xin Jue.

“Help me clean it,” smiled Xin Jue.

“You’re already so old, can’t you take care of yourself? Aren’t you ashamed? Alright, just this once. Don’t move.” Xin Yan teased him and she stepped forward to clean it. But her smile soon froze.

“Junior Brother, I’d like to have some time with Big Brother,” smiled Xin Yan as she turned around.

Lin Yun immediately woke up from his thoughts and he walked to the side. He looked at the lake with a wisp of sorrow plaguing his mind. He then closed his eyes. So what if he became the champion? Becoming the champion was nothing when he couldn’t even protect those close to him. His life was saved by Xin Jue, so this honor also belonged to Xin Jue. He only helped Xin Jue take back what belonged to the Ye Clan.

When he opened his eyes, his eyes flashed with an unyielding resolution. “I swear that I won’t let anyone near me get hurt ever again!”

This was a promise he made to himself, one that would follow him for the rest of his life. His sword wasn’t just for destruction, but also for protection. He had to become stronger because this was the law of nature, the strong would prey on the weak. Hua Yunxu’s appearance had left a deep impression on him. If Lord Thirteen and Jian Xuanhe weren’t around, he would have died. It was a terrifying experience for him because he had been so helpless.

The youth beside Hua Yunxu also gave him huge pressure because that young man was in the Violet Palace Realm at such a young age. Such talent was simply unimaginable in the Great Qin Empire, but the truth was before his eyes.

Right at this moment, two figures slowly walked out of the fog. It was Lord Thirteen and Jian Xuanhe.

“Brat, what are you thinking about? You just became the champion, why don’t you look happy?” smiled Lord Thirteen.

“Probably because Hua Yunxu’s appearance pressured him,” smiled Jian Xuanhe.

“Greetings, seniors.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together.

“Brat, come here.” Lord Thirteen waved his hand as he spoke with a solemn expression, “Don’t think too much about it. Do you know what Hua Yunxu was initially thinking of?”

“What was he thinking of?” wondered Lin Yun.

“Haha, can’t you tell that he was interested in you? He wanted to forcibly take you as his disciple,” smiled Lord Thirteen.

“What?” asked Lin Yun.

“Brat, you have to know one thing. The entire empire is nothing in his eyes. Compared to Qin Yu, you’re even more important in his eyes. This means that you’re extremely talented that even the Profound Yang Palace is interested in you,” said Lord Thirteen. He continued, “But this fatty won’t let him get away with it. This is why the only option Hua Yunxu had was to leave.”

Jian Xuanhe glared at Lord Thirteen before he continued, “It’s weird though. He doesn’t seem like someone who would leave so easily.”

“Is he strong?” asked Lin Yun.

“Very. We’re not afraid of him, but there’s nothing we can do to stop him if he’s after you,” said Jian Xuanhe.

“Since that’s the case, why did he leave so easily?” asked Lin Yun.

The two seniors exchanged a glance because they too were baffled. However, Lord Thirteen soon looked at Lin Yun with a deep glance and voiced his speculation, “Because the lass on the throne seat glanced at him. That lass isn’t simple.”

“You’re acquainted with her?” asked Jian Xuanhe.

She had stood up to help Lin Yun during Qin Yu’s wedding. And now, she stood up to help Lin Yun when he was in danger. The first time might have been a coincidence, but a second time? It really couldn’t be a coincidence. Lin Yun smiled bitterly because he didn’t know that she was so dangerous back then. So it turns out that Hua Yunxu didn’t leave because of the mysterious envoy, but because the princess looked at him.

“I don’t,” replied Lin Yun after a long time.

“Forget it. Let’s not talk about it anymore. Lin Yun, what do you have in mind after this?” asked Lord Thirteen.

“I plan to leave the Great Qin Empire for some time and travel around the Ancient Southern Domain,” replied Lin Yun.

“That’s great. This is what people have done in the past. You won’t know how strong true geniuses are without going out. Only then can you bring out the full potential of your talent.” Jian Xuanhe paused briefly before he continued, “But your foundation is still a little too weak. Stabilize it well before leaving. Before you go, I also have a gift for you.”

“A gift?” Lin Yun was curious.

“There’s no need to think about it. You’ll know when the time comes. Fatty is definitely better than that damned envoy who only knows how to give out cosmic artifacts,” smiled Lord Thirteen. Clearly, they were still unhappy about the unreliable envoy who enjoyed the show rather than taking a stand. This also resulted in the Sword Firmament Pavilion being put in a dangerous situation.

“Stay here in the Sword Firmament Pavilion for the next few days. Remember that your name will one day spread throughout the Great Qin Empire since you grasped the xiantian sword intent before reaching the Violet Palace Realm,” smiled Lord Thirteen with a gratified expression.

“Where’s Xin Yan?” asked Jian Xuanhe.

“She went to see Big Brother,” replied Lin Yun.

“Let’s go over as well. She has really suffered a lot, but at least things turned out better in the end.” The two old men smiled as they headed towards Xin Yan.

Looking at the two elders, Lin Yun finally made his decision and said, “Please wait. I have something to say.”

“Oh?” Jian Xuanhe and Lord Thirteen both turned around.

Mustering his courage, Lin Yun spoke up, “I won’t forget the grace that the two of you have shown me. If you need me in the future, just let me know. I won’t frown even before death.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Lin Yun had to muster his courage to say those words to two Heavenly Soul Realm experts. If an outsider were present, they would definitely laugh out loud that someone in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm said those words. Not only do you need courage, but you also needed self-confidence to say it.

“Hahaha!” Jian Xuanhe and Lord Thirteen were stunned for a moment before they laughed.

“Alright, I’ll keep it in mind,” replied Jian Xuanhe.

“Me too,” responded Lord Thirteen.
