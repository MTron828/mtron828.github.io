Chapter 801 - Charm

This was a battle between two beauties. Naturally, the atmosphere was intense, especially when the crowd saw Qing Ruoyou’s cold expression.

“Qing Ruoyou hid her strength in the previous banquet, which is why she didn’t make it into the top ten. It looks like she prepared well this time, plus her Indigomoon Sutra is extremely bizarre. As for Yue Weiwei, no one can see through her completely. I can’t tell who has the advantage.”

“Is there a need to talk about it? It’s Qing Ruoyou for sure. The Indigomoon Elysium has the deepest foundation among the nine overlord forces. Additionally, the Indigomoon Sutra is famous throughout the Ancient Southern Domain. Although Yue Weiwei is proficient with her music, it’s nothing before a genuine expert.”

“Indeed. The music path is too profound and it’s not easy to cultivate. It will only show its might in the Heavenly Soul Realm, so Yue Weiwei might fall flat.”

“Let’s wait and see.”

Qing Ruoyou and Yue Weiwei started their fight while everyone was giving their opinion. Qing Ruoyou immediately formed seals with her hands, creating a bright moon that exploded with purple light and enveloped the stage.

Contrary to everyone’s expectation, Yue Weiwei played her flute while her figure moved around charmingly.

“Indigomoon Essence!” Qing Ruoyou’s face turned cold as she made the first move. When she pointed her finger, the moonlight shining on the stage became cold and froze the stage instantly. On top of this, a surge of frost intent exploded out of her body.

This left everyone shocked because no one expected that Qing Ruoyou comprehended frost intent. When she pointed her finger out, countless cold rays shot towards Yue Weiwei. She clearly intended to freeze Yue Weiwei and kick her off the stage.

“Emerald Ocean!” Yue Weiwei raised her flute and stabbed it out like a sword. With her stab, the sky split apart and an emerald ocean spread out. The moonlight essence on the ground also started to crack as the sword ray flew.

Qing Ruoyou was surprised and was forced to dodge Yue Weiwei’s attack with her movement technique. Then, she threw a punch. The moonlight essence froze in mid-air as hundreds of ice arrows flew towards Yue Weiwei. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Yue Weiwei faced them calmly as she stretched her hand out and gently hit the incoming arrows. A note filled the air and caused many ice arrows to shatter while Yue Weiwei spun in mid-air.

Flute music rang out as an invisible soundwave spread out and collided with Qing Ruoyou’s origin energy. Soon, the moonlight essence around her began to shatter. Even the purple moon in the sky became blurred under the soundwave.

Everyone’s jaw dropped as Yue Weiwei’s attainment in music was unfathomable. A simple wave of her flute created a huge commotion. Qing Ruoyou’s face turned black as she cursed inwardly before she sent a claw towards Yue Weiwei. “Indigomoon Heart-piercing Claw!”

The Indigomoon Sutra was very broad. It consisted of cultivation techniques, earth-grade martial techniques, and other rare powerful techniques. The Indigomoon Heart-piercing Claw was one of the powerful techniques and was also an extremely vicious attack. It was meant to stab someone’s chest and rip their heart out.

Under her claw, the surrounding soundwave shattered and the claw flew towards Yue Weiwei’s heart. Qing Ruoyou’s speed was extremely fast, so it was hard to see her. Only the sound of her claw slicing through the wind was detectable.

Yue Weiwei didn’t look down on this attack as she reached out with her jade flute. Her origin energy fluctuated as her red dress began to swell like a flower bud right before blooming. In the next second, red petals covered the entire stage and blocked the moonlight.

“You’re courting death!” Qing Ruoyou’s speed slowed down. In fact, she was trapped.

“Close!” Yue Weiwei smiled as she made a pulling motion with her left hand, forcing the petals to close. Her attack completely restricted Qing Ruoyou’s movements.

Seeing that she was about to be sealed, Qing Ruoyou cursed at Yue Weiwei’s smiling face, “Pitiful tricks. Demoness, I’ll tear your face apart when I get out!”

When she finished speaking, she found herself trapped in the flower bud that was shrinking in size. But just when the spectators thought Qing Ruoyou would lose in this manner, the flower bud made up of origin energy suddenly exploded. Countless purple ice shards tore the flower bud apart before heading towards Yue Weiwei. It was like a purple moon had exploded in the flower bud. Under Qing Ruoyou’s counterattack, the entire stage trembled violently.

“Falling River!” Yue Weiwei poured all of her origin energy into the jade flute as she retreated. When she brandished her jade flute, she controlled the tide of the river. Because of that, the ice shards ended up exploding before they could even reach her. The explosions were like fireworks, leaving everyone breathless.

“Is this it? You should admit defeat, bitch.” Qing Ruoyou walked towards Yue Weiwei while her gaze became sharper.

Yue Weiwei descended from the sky and smiled as if she hadn’t heard Qing Ruoyou’s words. Smiling, she calmly spoke, “Alright, then please listen to a song of mine. It’s called Bashful Daze.”

When Yue Weiwei placed her flute by her lips, Qing Ruoyou sneered in disdain, “Unorthodox methods. Sure, give me your best shot.”

Others might be afraid of Yue Weiwei’s music, but not her. As long as the purple moon hung high in the air, she could resist the mental impact. Additionally, the moon would allow her to devour her opponent’s origin energy. She was confident that Yue Weiwei would exhaust all her origin energy before she could finish her song. At that time, Yue Weiwei would be at her mercy.

Looking at the disdain in Qing Ruoyou’s eyes, Yue Weiwei smiled before bewitching flute music came from her jade flute. At the same time, the entire stage became hazy. In the beginning, Qing Ruoyou wasn’t bothered by it.

However, a brief moment later, her face changed. The tone of the music suddenly changed and Qing Ruoyou started to hear obscene sounds of men and women ringing in her ears. The voices made Qing Ruoyou’s face turn red as her concentration gradually faded.

“Demoness!” Qing Ruoyou bit on her tongue to regain her clarity. Her face was full of shame and rage. She quickly circulated her Indigomoon Sutra to avoid the flute music before charging at Yue Weiwei. Once again, she used the Indigomoon Heart-piercing Claw.

But the moment she moved, the flute music hit her ears again. The scene before her eyes also changed as men and women with untidy clothes smiled at her. She instantly lost her composure and concentrated all of her willpower to resist the flute music.

But the music became even clearer as a bizarre scene took place on the stage. Qing Ruoyou’s face was red as she began to undress on the stage while dancing.

“This…”

“What’s going on?” This scene instantly caused a huge commotion on the stage, leaving everyone dumbfounded. After all, Qing Ruoyou was the Indigomoon Elysium’s princess! How could she actually perform such a dance at the banquet?

Many people were captivated by Qing Ruoyou’s dance and choked on their saliva. Even when the music suddenly stopped, all of them were still drooling over Qing Ruoyou’s dance.

“Big sister, you’re so beautiful.” Yue Weiwei lowered her flute and chuckled.

When Qing Ruoyou regained consciousness and examined her current state, her face instantly turned red. Killing aura flickered in her eyes as she glared at Yue Weiwei and barked, “Demoness, I’ll kill you!”

Yue Weiwei smiled gently before she placed the flute by her mouth to create more music. This instantly made Qing Ruoyou’s face change as her concentration faded away and she began to dance again.

“That’s enough!” A bark rang out as a figure descended from the Indigomoon Elysium’s seats. Using his origin energy, he disrupted the music forcibly. The intruder was naturally Yu Haotian whose face had turned terrifyingly dark.

“Senior brother.” Qing Ruoyou wanted to dig a hole to hide in as she had completely thrown away all of her face.

“We surrender,” said Yu Haotian as he looked at the judge.

The judge’s face was ugly as he pondered for a long time before he replied, “Don’t you dare interrupt again.”

“Stay safe, big sister.” Yue Weiwei chuckled harmlessly.

Under the uproar, Yu Haotian returned to the Indigomoon Elysium’s seats with Qing Ruoyou. When they returned, the faces of the sect’s elders were ugly as countless people looked at them. However, none of them dared to look at the spectators.

Beneath the stage, Lin Yun looked at Yue Weiwei. He instantly made up his mind that Yue Weiwei couldn’t be provoked. This time, Qing Ruoyou had kicked on an iron plate. Su Ziyao only gave her two slaps, but Yue Weiwei nearly made her strip completely on the stage.

With Qing Ruoyou’s usually aloof personality, this was definitely worse than death.
