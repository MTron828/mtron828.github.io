Chapter 1105 - Frustration!

At the same time, the sect master who was bearing the torrential sword intent also seemed to have noticed something unusual about this situation. He began to worry if something had happened. After all, he promised Senior Brother Feng Jue to make Lin Yun worthy of becoming their master’s disciple within one year. The only reason why he placed Lin Yun in the pit earlier was to force Lin Yun to bring out all his potential.

This was also the reason why he wanted Lin Yun to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain in the Heavenly Soul Realm. With Lin Yun’s cultivation, he knew that Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to go far, but he definitely would benefit greatly from it, which would make reaching the Empyrean Realm a lot easier. But if anything happened to Lin Yun, he would fail his objective.

It had been a century since his master took in a new disciple. Ever since he left the sect a century ago and slaughtered thousands of disciples from the Profound Sky Sect, his master hadn’t taken another disciple. It left a knot in his heart and in his master’s heart. Although he wasn’t his master’s most talented disciple, he was still important to his master.

But now that his master had decided to take in a new disciple, he naturally had to make Lin Yun qualified to inherit his master’s title as the strongest sword saint in the Eastern Desolation. At that time, the knot in his heart and his master’s heart would be resolved.

Although he knew that Lin Yun must have encountered some trouble, he had no intention of interfering and muttered, “Brat, don’t die in there.”

In reality, Lin Yun was enjoying his time in the mountains. After memorizing the verse, Lin Yun looked at the stone statue and smiled, “What’s your name?”

“My name is Stone One, master.” The stone statue replied.

Lin Yun was pleased that he was being called master. Looking at the stone statue, Lin Yun smiled, “Didn’t you want to chase me away earlier?”

“I wouldn’t dare to do that,” replied the stone statue.

Seeing that the stone statue was so boring, Lin Yun replied, “I’ll be going to the second test.”

Knowing that Lin Yun was about to leave, the stone statue quickly followed behind him. So Lin Yun responded in curiosity, “You’re going to follow me?”

“Master asked me to follow you to make sure that nothing happens to you,” said the stone statue respectfully.

“Come on then.” Lin Yun didn’t think that there would be an issue with the stone statue following him around, not to mention that it would further ensure his safety.

After Lin Yun passed his test, he could sense a boundless sword intent in the surroundings. So as he walked on the small path, he was placed under immense pressure.

He finally understood why Ye Ziling was sure that he could only make it through three tests. Leaving the difficulty of the tests aside, just walking on the path wasn’t easy since he wasn’t in the Empyrean Realm.

This meant that he had to rely on his sky sword intent to make it through the pressure. Although his sky sword intent could enable him to make it through the first three tests, he knew that it wouldn’t be easy. But just when he was about to bring out his sky sword intent, the stone statue suddenly stepped forward to bear the pressure of the sword intent.

“Master, follow behind me.” The stone statue was in the Dragon Pulse Realm, not to mention that it was a puppet. So the pressure was nothing to it.

When Lin Yun saw this scene, his eyes lit up while he smiled. It was a form of cheating, but Lin Yun didn’t feel bad about it. After all, he didn’t command the stone statue to follow and protect him.

“Hmph, look at you, you don’t have a backbone. You’re just letting the stone statue help you.” Lil’ Purple mocked Lin Yun as he walked behind the stone statue like its boss.

However, Lin Yun wasn’t disturbed by the comment. He simply focused on sensing the law of the sword intent and absorbed its essence. WIth this, his sword intent gradually improved.

“If I can make it to the peak, I might be able to complete whatever is lacking in my sword intent.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with excitement. It didn’t take long for him to arrive at the next test. He had taken a long time for the first test, but now it should be easy.

It didn’t take long for him to make it through the second test to obtain the second sword of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Technique and the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra. At the same time, another stone statue was added to the party.

After the second test, the pressure became even stronger. There were even ferocious beasts lurking around. However, Lin Yun didn’t worry because he had two stone statues clearing the path for him. They would kill any ferocious beasts that dared to get close. So the remaining beasts could only lay on the ground in fear.

Lin Yun began to laugh because this treatment had far exceeded his imagination. If there were other disciples around to see what was happening, they would be shocked. As Lil’ Purple watched, she pouted in jealousy. She couldn’t stand Lin Yun’s smug attitude when she had an even more glorious past.

Four hours after Lin Yun entered the Sword Saint Mountain, many disciples began to discuss Lin Yun’s status. They weren’t sure what happened since they had yet to see a phenomenon from the mountain.

“Don’t tell me Lin Yun failed the first test?”

“It’s hard to say. It has been four hours, so he’s probably trapped. If he had made it through the first test, we would have seen a phenomenon…”

“Hahaha, it’ll be interesting if he can’t even make it through the first test.” The Flying Cloud Palace became loud as many disciples began to discuss among themselves. All of the disciples were still bitter about Lin Yun’s performance, so they were hoping he would fail. After all, failure would mean that Lin Yun was just an ordinary person.

“Senior Sister, are the thirteen tests really that hard?” Wang Yuruo asked softly with Lil’ Red in her embrace.

Ye Ziling’s mood was much improved when she saw that Lin Yun still hadn’t passed the first test after four hours. Pride flashed through her pupils as she replied, “Of course! The tests are difficult because you need strong talent in the sword dao and strength. As for the paths after the tests, even an empyrean will have difficulty walking. After all, I suffered a setback one year ago even with my cultivation in the greater Galaxy Stage. In fact, I barely made it to the ninth test.”

“Will Senior Brother Yun be able to make it through the first test?” Wang Yuruo asked nervously.

“There’s a high possibility. He can definitely find the words with his talent, but it’s another story if he can defeat it. After all, he’s only in the Heavenly Soul Realm.” Ye Ziling smiled confidently. Then, she turned to Lil’ Red who was in Wang Yuruo’s embrace, “This damnable cat really knows how to sleep while his master is being tortured in the Sword Saint Mountain.”

“Ah!” Wang Yuruo became nervous when she heard that and continued, “Senior Sister, go and help Senior Brother Yun.”

“I can’t. He’s the one who acted impudently and even made a bet with me. Don’t worry about him, he won’t die. At most, he will be embarrassed,” smiled Ye Ziling.

But right at this moment, a sword hum echoed out that enveloped the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. The sword hum sounded ancient, which made everyone’s blood boil.

The phenomenon also made Ye Ziling’s face change as she quickly turned to look at the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Then, she saw an azure light enveloping the Sword Saint Mountain. From the looks of it, a divine beast, the Azure Bird, was flying around the mountain.

“An Azure Bird!”

“Lin Yun made it through the first test!” An uproar broke out in the Flying Cloud Palace. The Azure Bird was the holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud Thirteen Sword, and it would appear when someone made it through a test. This also meant that Lin Yun had successfully made it through the first test.

“Senior Sister, Lin Yun made it!” Wang Yuruo jumped around in excitement with joy written on her face.

Ye Ziling’s face became unnatural as she turned her head away, “There’s nothing to be happy about. It’s just the first test.”

But not long later, another azure light shined from the Sword Saint Mountain along with a sword hum. Then, another Azure Bird flew out of the mountain, leaving everyone shocked.

“Holy shit, what’s going on? He made it through another test?”

“How is that possible? He had just made it through the first test. How did he make it through the second one so quickly?”

“W-w-what’s going on?” Many disciples were left shocked, including Ye Ziling, who turned around with flickering eyes. She was confident that it would take Lin Yun at least an hour with his cultivation in the Heavenly Soul Realm, but it had only been half an hour!

While everyone was in shock, another sword hum echoed out while another Azure Bird flew out. The third test was successfully passed. This time, Ye Ziling could no longer maintain her composure. She quickly traveled to the border of the Flying Cloud Palace to look at the Sword Saint Mountain.

The Sword Saint Mountain was enveloped with three bright Azure Birds with powerful sword intent. She could tell that they were real, which meant that Lin Yun really made it through the third test. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Then, another Azure Bird flew out that was accompanied by a sword hum. At this moment, the entire Flying Cloud Palace fell silent. However, the commotion didn’t stop. Four more Azure Birds flew into the sky.

Lin Yun was ferociously charging through the Sword Saint Mountain. He completed eight tests in a row with a speed that left everyone dumbfounded. The whole time, the disciples were staring at Ye Ziling because Lin Yun was getting closer and closer to Ye Ziling’s record.

Suddenly, another azure light shined from the mountain. This time, the disciples could no longer maintain their composure. In disbelief, they wondered if Lin Yun was still human.

“Senior Sister, look! Senior Brother Yun is really strong! He already made it through nine tests!” Wang Yuruo’s face turned red with excitement as her eyes became bright.

However, Ye Ziling couldn’t smile. Her jaw was clenched as she made a tight fist with her hand. She was angry that Lin Yun had the same record as her. So what? As long as Lin Yun doesn’t reach the peak, it’s still my victory. But when Ye Ziling raised her head to look at the nine Azure Birds in the sky, her face couldn’t help turning red with frustration.
