Chapter 1559 - Heavenly Pool Manor

The two briefly chatted before they headed to the foot of the mountain. At the foot of the mountain, a few people were waiting for them, aside from the disciples who were sending them off.

Mu Xueqin was the party's leader, and two more were standing beside her. Lin Yun recognized them, since they were experts on the Heaven Ranking. One of them was the Scarlet Firmament Peak’s Zhou Yuan, ranked tenth and at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. The second one was also from the Scarlet Firmament Peak’s Wang Yun, ranked eighth and also at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

The three were geniuses on the Sword Sect’s Heaven Ranking, especially Mu Xueqin, who was ranked third. She even had some fame in the Ancient Barren Domain. This time, they weren’t the protagonists, but the four people standing behind them. Those were the saints’ disciples who had just left Saint Mountain.

Six saints took in a disciple each, but the Emerald Firmament Peak and Profound Firmament Peak didn’t have any sword inheritance. So the two saints’ disciples weren’t around.

The remaining four were the disciple of the Azure Firmament Peak’s Azure Storm Saint Lord Jiang Cheng, the disciple of the Indigo Firmament Peak’s Indigo Lightning Saint Lord Ye Ziling, a disciple of the Gold Firmament Peak’s Heavenly Heart Saint Lord Zhao Yan, and the disciple of the Scarlet Firmament Peak Scarlet Sun Saint Lord Ye Ziyun.

Aside from that, the twin stars of the Earth Ranking, Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi, would also be participating in the Heavenly Pool Gathering. But they were insignificant compared to the saints’ disciples.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he bumped gaze with Ye Ziling, and they both smiled. Although it had been a year since they last met, there wasn’t any distance between them despite being apart for so long.

Shortly after, Lin Yun greeted Zhao Yan. Ye Ziling’s cultivation reached the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. As for Zhao Yan and Ye Ziyun, they were slightly weaker in comparison and only at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. Then again, reaching such high cultivation wasn’t something that could be achieved with a saint’s guidance alone.

As for Lin Yun, he had his encounters, as well as the Radiant Sword Saint and Mu Xuankong having been taking care of him. Based on his talent, it would be weird if he was weaker than them. Only Mu Qingqing didn’t know the reason within.

“Young Master Lin, it has been a month since we met, and I’ve missed you greatly!” Ye Ziyun said in a half-joking and half-serious tone. It wasn’t because she was in love with Lin Yun but because she just wanted to probe Ye Ziling. Over the past year, her heartthrob for Lin Yun had already faded away.

“You should address me as your Senior Brother.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Haha, it’ll make us look closer this way.” Ye Ziyun said as she looked at Ye Ziling. She soon lost interest when she saw that there wasn’t much response from Ye Ziling.

“Senior Brother Lin, it has been a long time!” Jiang Cheng smiled, and Lin Yun nodded in response.

“These are the saints’ disciples? They all have powerful auras, and I heard they all practiced a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique!”

“Practising a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique at the Elysium Core Realm? How is this possible?”

“It’s impossible for us, but not for saint disciples like them.”

“Senior Brother Lin seems pale in comparison when standing together with them… not to mention that there hasn’t been any news about Senior Brother Lin for the past six months.”

“Senior Brother Lin is also a saint disciple, but it’s a pity that Martial Ancestor Radiant has been in seclusion and doesn’t have much time to teach Lin Yun. Otherwise, Lin Yun would not be inferior to them.”

Those who arrived after couldn’t help comparing Lin Yun with the saints’ disciples. Amongst the saints’ disciples, Jiang Cheng naturally stood out with his cultivation at the pinnacle of the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. He even showed signs of reaching the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

In terms of aura, Ye Ziling was calmer in comparison. Over the past year of bitter cultivation, she had calmed down a lot. As for Zhao Yan, his changes were more minor than everyone else. He was still standing there without any focus in his pupils, and Lin Yun couldn’t even be sure if Zhao Yan had heard his greeting.

“Junior Brother Lin, have you been in bitter cultivation all this time?” Mu Xueqin asked.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun replied. Half an incense’s time later, a ship with the Sword Sect’s flag slowly descended from the sky.

“Let’s go.” Mu Xueqin instructed and everyone boarded the ship. The Sword Sect was far from the Heavenly Pool Manor. If they fly by themselves, it would take at least fifteen days. But if they traveled with the ship, it would only take them two to three days. The ship could fly, and it was a warship that could resist the attacks of several Samsara Edict Realm experts.

As a violent gale blew, the ship flew into the air with everyone on it. When the ship entered the clouds, it bolted forth. At the same time, Mu Xueqin invited everyone to drink and share the current situation between the various sects, including things to take note of in the Heavenly Pool Gathering.

The Heavenly Pool Gathering was different from what Lin Yun had imagined. The eight powerful sects had two guaranteed quotas, while the remaining quotas were received by ranking. Since this involved the baptism, the competition would be intense.

The Sword Sect didn’t have an excellent ranking in the past gatherings after Mu Xueqin, Ye Xuanqing, and Gu Ruochen reached the Dragon Pulse Realm. In the previous Heavenly Pool Gathering, the Sword Sect only ranked fifth. In the end, the Sword Sect only received one guaranteed ranking, and that was a great humiliation to the Sword Sect.

Mu Xueqin led the party this time to boost the Sword Sect’s morale, hoping that the Sword Sect could obtain a good ranking at the Heavenly Pool Gathering.

“Who’s our greatest competitor this time?” Jiang Cheng asked as he took a sip of wine. He could reach the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm if he wanted. So he was filled with confidence for this Heavenly Pool Gathering.

“There are a lot of competitors,” said Mu Xueqin. “Aside from our mortal enemy, the Profound Sky Sect, there are also geniuses from the Heavenly Blade Pavilion, Vajra Monastery, and the Emerald Jade Manor. Especially the Vajra Monastery because they aren’t any weaker than the Sword Sect and Profound Sky Sect when regarding their comprehensive strength. But we’ll have to see to know the exact details because everyone has deeply hidden their strength.”FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Ancient Barren Domain might seem calm on the surface, but an undercurrent was flowing beneath it. Everyone knew there would be a huge battle when the Radiant Sword Saint dies. Many people predicted that the Radiant Sword Saint wouldn’t make it through this ordeal.

At that time, not only would the Sword Sect suffer a devastating disaster, but the other powerful sects would also be implicated. Everyone had been preparing for that. Even the saint lords had appeared to take in disciples, and it was unsure if the other sects had similar preparations.

But Lin Yun didn’t have much feeling about this Heavenly Pool Gathering. After reaching the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, he no longer had much anticipation for the Heavenly Pool Gathering. The baptism quota also wasn’t too attractive to him. Others might have their concerns, but he was confident he could condense dragon origin at the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

The trip to the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm allowed him to surpass his peers. He would give the quota to others. So he wouldn’t stand out if Jiang Cheng could handle the situation. At times, maintaining a low profile was a better choice.

Three days later, a majestic mountain appeared before everyone. This sword-like mountain was enveloped in clouds. When the ship stopped at the foot of the mountain, they were swiftly received by the Heavenly Pool Manor.

“Lady Mu, my father has been waiting for a long time.” An elegant youth wielding a sword in his right hand led several servants over. This person was the young lord of the Heavenly Pool Manor, Pei Qian. He was well-mannered and didn’t dare to look down on the Sword Sect.

The group was swiftly led into the Heavenly Pool Manor. The Heavenly Pool Manor was situated at the waist of the mountain, and the Heavenly Pool Manor had multiple tall buildings along with hovering palaces. It was even more glorious to many saint clans.

The banquet would be held at a pavilion in the Heavenly Pool Manor, and there were many suspending passages among the pavilions. Seven massive floating pavilions were positioned in a circle formation with a huge stage at the center of it.

The pavilions had no doors and were connected with floating passages. This arrangement would make everyone feel as though they were in the clouds.

Pei Qian led the Sword Sect’s party to a pavilion before he left. Several servants swiftly came over when everyone sat down with fruits and wine. The main pavilion was empty, and that belonged to the Heavenly Pool Manor, where the lord of the manor would personally host the banquet.

The lord of the manor was known as the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord, and he could be considered an expert in the Ancient Barren Domain. Otherwise, this place would have long been snatched by someone else.

When Lin Yun looked around, he noticed that four parties had already arrived. Although he hadn’t seen them before, he could recognize their origin after judging their auras and the clothes that they were wearing. The ones donned in green uniforms were from the Emerald Jade Manor, the monks were naturally from the Vajra Monastery, and the group of women must be from the Heavenly Note Sect. As for the remaining pavilion, they were practically all spiritualists, so they must be disciples of the Profound Valley.

In the past, the Heavenly Note Sect and Profound Valley were typically ranked at the bottom, and they didn’t have much sense of existence. The two sects were unique because one specialized in music while the other specialized in spiritual runes.

Music had a high threshold. It wasn’t that it was impossible to produce experts, but the requirement for comprehension was too high. But the two sects’ position in the Ancient Barren Domain wasn’t low.

The Heavenly Note Sect had a huge origin, and their information was unrivaled in the Ancient Barren Domain. They often held various auctions and banquets, which meant they had a good connection with multiple forces. This was the reason why no sect dared to belittle them.

As for the Profound Valley, there was naturally nothing to say about the Profound Valley, since they were proficient in refining elixirs, forging artifacts, and constructing spiritual arrays. All the best saint spiritualists in the Ancient Barren Domain were gathered there.

The Vajra Monastery had a Buddhism inheritance with a deep foundation, and they were more or less on the same level as the Sword Sect. The Emerald Jade Manor’s Divine Phaseless Art was famous in the Ancient Barren Domain, and they would often make it into the top three.

Five of the powerful sects were here. The only ones remaining were the Profound Sky Sect, Heavenly Blade Pavilion, and the Thunder Sect.

Not long after Lin Yun sat down, he could sense several gazes directed over. They were from the Profound Valley’s Tang Jing, Heavenly Note Sect’s Luo Shuyi, Vajra Monastery’s Cang Yun, and Emerald Jade Manor’s Ning Feng. They could all be considered acquaintances since they met on Profound Wither Island.

Tang Jing was emotional when he saw Lin Yun, but he only raised his cup since it wasn’t convenient for him to come over. Knowing what he was thinking, Lin Yun also raised his cup with a smile. Lin Yun saved his life, and he naturally wouldn’t forget it.

“This fellow is actually here, and his cultivation doesn’t seem low. It looks like this gathering will be interesting.” Cang Yun rubbed his head when he saw Lin Yun and started looking around.
