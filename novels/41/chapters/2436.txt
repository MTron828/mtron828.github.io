Chapter 2437 - Flower Burial Sword

Jian Jingtian’s aura suppressed the three Great Saints. He was stronger than Mu Xuankong, regardless of his cultivation, sword intent, or the Great Profound Sword Canon. There might be a huge gap between him and any of the holy lands’ sect masters without the Saint Sword and Greater Heaven Authority Order.

But with them in his hand, this qualified him to face the three Great Saints, and he could even suppress them in terms of his sword aura.

The Heavenly Sever, Heavenly Glory, and Flame Crow Great Saints frowned with grave expressions and didn’t charge forth. Meanwhile, the mysterious Great Saint joined hands with the Azure Python Great Saint to hold back the Light Subduing Great Saint.

The Light Subduing Great Saint was too powerful since he possessed the Sun-Moon Saint Cloth, grasped an Eternal Dao, and had the Imperial Dragon Order in his hand. When the Imperial Dragon Order flew out, a Golden-Purple Divine Dragon flew out, containing the soul of an actual divine dragon, giving off a powerful aura.

“Don’t fight him head-on. With the Eternal Dao, the Light Subduing Great Saint will defeat the Azure Python Great Saint and the hooded man sooner or later. We just have to hold him down,” the Heavenly Sever Great Saint said.

The Heavenly Glory and Flame Crow Great Saints were surprised. The Heavenly Sever Great Saint was the chief of Black Mountain’s Seven Saints and naturally stronger than the two of them. No one knew if the Heavenly Sever Great Saint had grasped an Eternal Dao. So, it was unbelievable that someone like him would be so cautious. But they had to admit that what he said wasn’t wrong.

Those who grasped an Eternal Dao could fight those with a higher cultivation than them and suppress those in the same cultivation. Not to mention that the Light Subduing Great Saint’s cultivation wasn’t weak and he had the highest chance of becoming an Emperor amongst them. He could go through his Emperor Tribulation anytime if he had enough confidence.

The reason why he couldn’t take down the two Great Saints was because the two Great Saints weren’t pushovers either, but it was just a matter of time.

“Agreed,” the Heavenly Glory and Flame Crow Great Saints agreed.

Jian Jingtian’s face changed because he intentionally provoked the three of them. But if they had no intentions of fighting him head-on, he would have no way to take them down.

“It looks like so-called ‘sect masters’ aren’t anything impressive after all. I’ll come since you guys aren’t coming!” Jian Jingtian snorted and charged over. He chose the Heavenly Glory Great Saint first. This was a famous Blade Saint with his blade intent reaching the pinnacle of seventh grade.

The Heavenly Glory Great Saint was sent flying away when the blade and sword clashed. The eight swords behind Jian Jingtian were much stronger than Mu Xuankong, and this was too unbelievable. He understood why the Heavenly Sever Great Saint only wanted to hold Jian Jingtian down. If they chose to fight Jian Jingtian head-on, they might not be able to bear his attack even if they reached the Immortal Stage.

Jian Jingtian forced the Heavenly Glory and Flame Crow Great Saints to retreat with just one exchange. Only the Heavenly Sever Great Saint managed to take Jian Jingtian’s attack head-on. But the Heavenly Sever Great Saint merely sneered before manifesting into a massive ghostly figure behind him.

He dodged Jian Jingtiqn’s sword intent and moved with swift speed. He had a strong cultivation, but he didn’t choose to fight with Jian Jingtian head-on. In addition to the two sect masters helping from the side, they managed to hold back Jian Jingtian. The latter wanted to fight with the Light Subduing Great Saint, but the Heavenly Sever Great Saint would hold him back.

“These people aren’t pushovers and Junior Brother will be in trouble once the earth energy weakens,” Mu Xuankong frowned.

Feng Yu naturally noticed the situation as well, but this was because there were too many people from the Profound Sky Sect.

An hour later, an explosion occurred and Pellet Firmament Peak collapsed. The Great Saints stationed there had failed to protect the peak.

When Pellet Firmament Peak collapsed, saint aura gushed from the ground, and this scene made Mu Xuankong feel a headache beccause this was the foundation of the Sword Sect.

When Heavenly Sever, Heavenly Glory, and Flame Crow Great Saints saw this scene, their morale rose with a smile on their faces. The Sword Sect was a tough nut to crack, but they would be able to take the Sword Sect down sooner or later.

Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain was the most mysterious place in the Kunlun Realm, isolated from the outside world. This place looked like a celestial ground with an ancient teleportation array at the center of the square.

A woman was playing the zither on the square, playing the Prairie Phoenix Fire. She gave off a noble air around her. She was Mu Xueling. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, she stopped as the surrounding birds left. But Mu Xueling wasn’t bothered by that, but looked at the teleportation array at the center of the square. She asked, “He’s back?”

She had been stationed here since the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain received the message from the Iris Sword Saint. The light released by the teleportation array alarmed the entire Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain before a handsome man appeared within the array, looking around. This person was naturally Flower Burial Lin Yun.

After Lin Yun finished cultivating in the Azure Sky Realm, he returned to the Kunlun Realm with instructions from the Iris Sword Saint. He looked around since this was the first time he had visited the mysterious Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. But no one dared disrespect the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain in the Kunlun Realm.

“Saint Elder!” Lin Yun soon discovered Mu Xueling. He walked over with a smile and cupped his fists together, “Greetings, Saint Elder. It’s a joy to see you first thing upon my return to the Kunlun Realm.”

His cultivation was even stronger than Mu Xueling, but he was used to addressing her as ‘Saint Elder.’

Mu Xueling examined Lin Yun and noticed his unfathomable cultivation. The saint daos around him even terrified her, and she knew Lin Yun had far surpassed her. Even so, the joy in his eyes wasn’t fake or insincere.

“How’s the Sword Sect’s situation?”

“How’s Weiwei?” The two asked at the same time.

Lin Yun was stunned and smiled, “I’ll go first. Weiwei has taken the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity as her master, so you don’t have to worry about her.”

Mu Xueling was relieved upon hearing that, before she said with guilt, “The Sword Sect’s situation isn’t good. I have fixed your Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, and I’ve been here, waiting for you to give you the Nirvana Divine Rune that the Iris Sword Saint left behind under his instructions. Come with me to see the holy master, and we’ll talk along the way.”

The Nirvana Divine Rune? Lin Yun was surprised and didn’t expect that the Iris Sword Saint had left the Nirvana Divine Rune on Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. Then again, it also made sense for the Iris Sword Saint to leave behind the Nirvana Divine Rune if he had to leave behind one of the seven Sovereign Divine Runes. After all, it would be impossible to control the Nirvana Divine Rune without grasping Nirvana Dao.

Lin Yun’s heart began to beat and the Flower Burial Sword became emotional ever since he arrived on Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. It was as though it had been here before.

Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by it initially and suppressed the Flower Burial. But as he got closer, the Flower Burial Sword became even more restless, and it was going out of his control.

“What’s wrong?” Mu Xueling asked.

Lin Yun didn’t hide it from her and said, “It’s weird. The closer I get to the divine palace, the more restless my sword becomes. But it’s not a big issue. I’ll ask the holy master when I see him. Please tell me about the Sword Sect.”

Mu Xueling no longer asked but shared what was going on in the Sword Sect. Lin Yun’s facial expression became grave before he heaved a sigh of relief. He had already expected the worst scenario, that the Sword Sect was destroyed upon his master’s death when he returned. The situation might be terrible, but it wasn’t over.

A cold light flashed within Lin Yun’s eyes, and he clenched his fists. He was in a hurry but still had to contain his emotions. Whether it was the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella or the Nirvana Divine Rune, they could greatly strengthen his strength, not to mention that he also had to ask about the Flower Burial Sword.

Lin Yun smiled, “Saint Elder, let me bring you there.”

They were getting close to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Palace, but there was some distance away. Lin Yun initially wanted to take care of Mu Xueling’s feelings, but he couldn’t hold back any longer. Under Mu Xueling’s exclamation, Lin Yun grabbed Mu Xueling by her shoulder and dashed forth.

This shocked Mu Xueling since it didn’t just feel as if space had passed by, but time had decelerated. She widened her eyes in shock and couldn’t comprehend how Lin Yun accomplished that. But when she looked at him, she could see a faint smile on his face.

After they moved, they swiftly came to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain, and Mu Xueling was still in a daze even after she landed on the ground. When time and space finally stabilized, the palace gradually became clear. She soon thought it might be a means of the Nirvana Dao and he had reached a high level.

She couldn’t imagine what happened to Lin Yun when he was only twenty-eight. How old was the Iris Sword Saint when he reached this level?

“The Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple is here to pay the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master a visit!” Lin Yun didn’t know what Mu Xueling was thinking but had cupped his fists together.

When the ancient doors opened, the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master walked out. This woman shocked Lin Yun because the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master gave him a feeling that she was even more mysterious than the Iris Sword Saint.

But before he could speak, the Flower Burial Sword flew out from his heart and headed for the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master. This shocked Lin Yun and Mu Xueling; even the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master was surprised. She asked, “Is this the sword of the Southern Emperor?”

Lin Yun nodded in response to the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master’s question.
