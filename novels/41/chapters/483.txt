Chapter 484 - Laughing From Rage

“I’m sorry, Big Brother Lin,” whispered Bai Yi with her face blushed.

“Why are you apologizing?” asked Lin Yun.

“Because it’s my fault. I couldn’t stop Senior Sister Siyin from taking your items previously. She even managed to keep them by claiming that she was holding on to it for safekeeping. I thought that Senior Sister Liu could do something about it…” She didn’t hate Lu Siyin, she only blamed Liu Yunyan for taking Lu Siyin’s side.

Lin Yun laughed inwardly at Bai Yi’s innocence. How could Liu Yunyan not help her junior sister instead of an outsider? Not to mention that he was already a crippled in Liu Yunyan’s eyes. Since Lu Siyin liked it, he didn’t mind letting her hold it for now.

“Big Brother Lin, why aren’t you feeling anxious?” asked Bai Yi.

“Why would I be anxious? No one can take my sword away, so I don’t mind leaving it with her for now,” smiled Lin Yun with a cold light flashing in the depths of his eyes. He already told Lu Siyin to remember her words. Even a greater Yin stage cultivator couldn’t take something from him, not to mention the Flower Burial Sword that came such a long way with him.

“Big Brother Lin, rest well for now. I’ll send something over for you to eat tomorrow,” smiled Bai Yi.

“Speaking of which, why do you think that I’m a good person?” asked Lin Yun.

“B-because how can someone so handsome be a bad person.” Bai Yi peeked at Lin Yun before she ran out of the room, bashful and embarrassed.

Her words made Lin Yun smile bitterly in his heart. It looks like Lu Siyin wasn’t exactly wrong. Bai Yi was a little too innocent, but even so, Lu Siyin was in no position to bully her. She saved his life, so he wouldn’t let anyone bully her as long as he was around. After all, he couldn’t possibly let a woman stand in front of him.

Closing the door, Lin Yun turned to look at his interspatial pouch and let out a breath of relief. It was good that no one took a look in the interspatial pouch or Lu Siyin would have been motivated by greed. But when he opened up his interspatial pouch, his face changed drastically.

His interspatial pouch only had second grade spiritual jades and other miscellaneous items. His Hidden Sword Gourd, Scarletflame War Flag, and Heavenly Soul Realm beast core were all gone.

BITCH! Lin Yun’s face turned dark with a killing aura flashing in the depths of his eyes.

“You want to mess with me?” Lin Yun instantly figured out why Lu Siyin pretended not to have touched his interspatial pouch. This was probably because she didn’t want him to check his interspatial pouch in front of Liu Yunyan. Even if he stood up later, she could’ve said that he framed her. Lin Yun kept the interspatial pouch and began to laugh in rage.

“You want to play? Let’s play then!” Lin Yun soon calmed down because he knew everything would be alright once he recovered his cultivation.

A bright moon hung high in the night sky and the lake roared like a ferocious beast. This river was truly fitting of its name, the Raging Dragon River. But the massive boat journeyed steadily in the river, despite the ferocious nature of the river. Clearly, the Heavenly Province Academy had a huge backing and this boat wasn’t simple.

Lin Yun sat in the storage room as the dracophant energy flowed on his body, dying the surface of his body with a purple glow that brimmed with vitality. The healing capability in the Dracophant Battle Physique after reaching the fifth stage was terrifying.

As his origin energy mixed with the dracophant energy flowing within his body, crackling sounds were occasionally heard. It was like a silkworm breaking through the cocoon. The injuries that were impossible to recover from in the eyes of others were gradually recovering at a visible speed.

He had suffered even more serious injuries than this when his Dracophant Battle Physique wasn’t in the fifth stage, so these injuries were nothing to him. He just hoped that Lu Siyin wouldn’t regret her actions in the future.

Sensing his internal injuries slowly recovering, Lin Yun began to relax. His recovery speed was faster than he’d imagined. Suddenly, his profound veins began to wriggle and his body emitted a silvery glow.

“This is…” Lin Yun was shocked by this sudden phenomenon. He realized that 70% of his origin energy had been converted into sword energy.

“Already 70%?” Lin Yun then figured out that the Iris Sword Sutra must have been triggered in the fight with the black-clothed old man, converting 70% of his origin energy into sword energy. All without the help of any third grade spiritual jades.

Then again, he wasn’t surprised by it. Many people made a breakthrough in life and death situations as they would trigger the potential within the body. The only issue was that you might be killed if you were careless. It could be considered a fortune within misfortune.

At the same time, within an elegant room, a boy and girl sat in front of a pile of treasures. If Lin Yun was here, he would recognize the items on the table - the Scarletflame War Flag, the Rose Painting, the Heavenly Soul Realm beast core, and the Hidden Sword Gourd. As for the two people, they were naturally Lu Siyin and Leng Feng.

“Tsk tsk, incredible. A sword slave actually has so many treasures,” said Leng Feng as he looked at the treasures on the table with greed.

“This war flag isn’t simple. It can be repaired into a high grade cosmic artifact back in the sect and this Hidden Sword Gourd is a rare treasure. As for this painting, there’s something weird about it. We actually can’t see through it even with our attainments in spiritual runes.”

Leng Feng paused briefly before he looked at the Heavenly Soul Realm beast core. The beast core was red and engraved with bizarre demonic runes. Judging from its aura, it was clearly the Heavenly Soul Realm beast core that belonged to an overlord demonic beast. Its value was incredibly high and Leng Feng couldn’t conceal the greed in his eyes.

“I wonder where that sword slave got these treasures from. No wonder he was crippled. The owner of these items must have a huge backing, but it’s all mine now,” smiled Lu Siyin.

“Senior Sister Lu, what if that sword slave discovers that these are missing and goes to look for Senior Sister Liu?” said Leng Feng as he gulped down a mouthful of saliva.

“He’s just a sword slave. He won’t do that if he’s tactful,” said Lu Siyin with a cold light flashing through his eyes. “Furthermore, he needs proof if he wants to make a complaint. Why do you think I bothered acting in front of Liu Yunyan? This proved that I didn’t look into his interspatial pouch. He can only blame himself for being a fool! If he does complain, I can bite back at him for framing me!”

“You’re smart, Senior Sister. Why don’t I make a move and kill him once and for all? He’s just a cripple, so no one will pay any attention to him,” said Leng Feng coldly with killing aura flashing in his eyes.

“Are you a fool? If that sword slave is dead, Liu Yunyan will definitely suspect me. Don’t forget about her means. We’ll both be in trouble at that time,” barked Lu Siyin as she glared at Leng Feng.

“Oh, yeah.” Leng Feng shivered when he thought of Liu Yunyan. “We’ll both be in trouble if she finds out about this. I'm even surprised that she took your side with the sword today.”

“We’re disciples of the Heavenly Province Academy, so she won’t take the side of an outsider no matter what. Furthermore, that sword slave is already crippled in her eyes. Plus, she needs our help.” Lu Siyin began to feel exhausted and she waved her hand, “How about this, pick one out of the four.”

“Senior Sister, y-you know how I feel for you. I can even give my life for you, not to mention these treasures,” said Leng Feng.

Lu Siyin’s eyes flashed with loathing as she sneered, “Cut the crap. Pick one.”

Leng Feng knew that Lu Siyin was trying to bribe him. After a brief hesitation, he pointed at the painting, “I’ll take this then.”

Lu Siyun was surprised. She looked at Leng Feng and said, “And here I thought you'd pick the beast core. But this painting is weird. It might not be any inferior to the beast core if you’re able to comprehend something from it.”

Leng Feng sneered inwardly. That was under the prerequisite that he could comprehend. He knew that Lu Siyin wouldn’t agree with him picking the beast core.

“Take it and get lost,” said Lu Siyin.

Taking the painting, Leng Feng looked at Lu Siyin’s voluptuous figure before he left unwillingly. After Leng Feng left, Lu Siyin put the treasures on the table and sneered, “A crippled sword slave dares to fight with me? He better behave himself.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

But compared to the three treasures, she was more fond of the Flower Burial Sword. She drew the sword and started looking at it. After playing with it briefly, she smiled, “This is indeed a good sword.”
