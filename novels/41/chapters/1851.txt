Chapter 1852 - Lin Yun's Arrival

Everyone was dumbfounded, and the Nirvana Stage experts from the various holy lands recovered first. They quickly yelled, “Leave quickly. We’ll cover you guys!”

The five pinnacle Nirvana Stage experts charged at that expert from the Blood Moon Sect, wanting to cover the juniors of their sects, creating an opportunity for them to flee. But the Blood Moon Sect’s Quasi-Saint sneered before snapping the neck of the Heavenly Flame Sect’s Nirvana Stage expert apart. He said, “You guys think you can escape?”

But that Quasi-Saint didn’t stop there. A crimson radiance began to gather on his palm and sent the five pinnacle Nirvana Stage experts flying away. This made them throw out a mouthful of blood because that palm had dealt severe injuries to them, demonstrating the power of a Quasi-Saint.

Even if it was only a Quasi-Saint, this still meant this person had taken a step into the Saint Realm. So the Nirvana Stage experts were useless in front of him, regardless of their numbers. This was a drastic difference in quality, and it couldn’t be made up by quantity.

As the Fire God General soared to the sky, Ao Feng and Yan Cangming both pushed out a palm on their shoulders. “All of you, stop!”

A blazing crimson moon appeared behind the Fire God General, and he pushed his palm forth. His palm left behind ripples in the air, and an invisible power pressed down. This made Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng throw out a mouthful of blood, their faces becoming pale and landing on the sea’s surface. They both had shock within their pupils because the Fire God General was too powerful.

After leaving the Black Tortoise Void Sea, the Fire God General was the same as a tiger being released into the mountain. With the Nethermoon Saint Armor, it had brought his strength to an unbelievable height. Even if the Fire God General was only at the third stage Profound Death Stage, the Fire God General actually stopped all of them from escaping with the help of Ao Feng and Yan Cangming.

As the Fire God General descended from the sky, he coldly said, “Behave yourselves. Hand over all of the treasures you guys gathered from the Black Tortoise Void Sea. Otherwise, no one will be spared!”

Everyone furiously looked at the Fire God General. After all, why do they have to hand over the treasures they had collected from the Black Tortoise Void Sea after risking their lives? But the Blood Moon Sect was completely lawless just because they had a Quasi-Saint around.

It was pretty ironic because they were waiting for Lin Yun to come out. But they never expected to fall for the Blood Moon Sect’s trap instead. No one was convinced, but none of them dared to resist, either. The Heavenly Flame Sect lost two people, and one of them was at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage. The Quasi-Saint didn’t even give them a chance at all.

Under the gaze of the Fire God General, everyone had no choice but to retrieve their treasures from their interspatial bracelets. The three God Generals then picked what they wanted among them. Many of the treasures that weren’t from the Black Tortoise Void Sea were also taken away by them, demonstrating the three God Generals overbearing nature.

“This is the Blood Phoenix Blade of my Ji Clan, and it has nothing to do with the Black Tortoise Void Sea!” Ji Lingfeng glared at Ao Feng, who took his blade away.

“It doesn’t matter what you say, only what I say.” Ao Feng sneered and seized the blade.

Just when Ji Lingfeng was about to flare up on the spot, he was stopped by Xiao Yuanqi, who whispered in his ears, “Calm down.”

The Quasi-Saint from the Blood Moon Sect didn’t make a move, but his aura belonging to a Quasi-Saint had enveloped this entire region, and everyone’s movements were under his watch. As long as he wanted to, he could kill everyone here, including the five injured experts at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage who were present.

As for Ao Feng and Yan Cangming, they returned to the Fire God General with smiles after retrieving the treasures and were both excited. Ao Feng said, “Big Brother, you’re right. These people are only preserving them for us for the time being, and the treasures in the Black Tortoise Void Sea ultimately belong to us!”

“What should we do now? Leave this place?” Yan Cangming asked.

“The big fish has yet to come out.” The Fire God General said.

“But the Quasi-Saints of the six holy lands will probably make it over in a day or two. It has been half a month, and that brat might’ve left.” Ao Feng said.

“There’s no need to rush.” The Fire God General said. He then looked at Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi before he smiled, “With these two around, Lin Xiao will have to rush back, even if he had left.”

“Someone's out!” Right then, the holy lands’ parties exclaimed. Four figures flew out of the Black Tortoise Void Sea at an astonishing speed.

“Lin Xiao is out!” The white-clothed person was Lin Xiao, and they were all surprised before their facial expressions became complicated. Their expressions were mostly a mixture of embarrassment and shame. This was a ridiculing scene, and they finally saw Lin Yun after half a month. But they became the Blood Moon Sect’s prisoners before they could even get the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown from Lin Yun, with all of their treasures seized from them.

As Lin Yun’s group of four flew over, they landed beside Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng. When they saw that everyone was heavily injured, their expressions couldn’t help becoming weird.

“W-What’s going on?” An Liuyan asked.

Xiao Yuanqi bitterly smiled and knew Lin Yun must’ve come here after seeing them. He pointed out at a figure seated on the sea’s surface and smiled wryly, “That’s a Quasi-Saint of the Blood Moon Sect.”

But to his surprise, Lin Yun only nodded his head and didn’t have much fluctuation in his mood. Not only Lin Yun but An Liuyan and Mei Zihua were surprisingly calm. Even the old beggar wore a playful expression, devoid of the fear and panic that everyone was expecting on his face.

“Brother Lin, leave immediately if you have the ability. They won’t dare to do anything to us.” Ji Lingfeng said.

“Leave? Who do you think he is, trying to leave in front of a Quasi-Saint?” The face of the Ming Cult’s Huang Xuanyi was terrifyingly pale. But he couldn’t help speaking mockingly after seeing Lin Yun. He continued, “We can survive, but I’m afraid he won’t be able to die easily even if he wanted to!”

But Lin Yun turned a deaf ear to Huang Xuanyi, and he said, “Is everyone here waiting for me?”

Everyone’s faces changed when they heard that, and they didn’t dare to look at Lin Yun. This naturally made Mei Zihua and An Liuyan’s faces change. They weren’t fools, and they immediately figured out what was going on with fury in their pupils.

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised, and he had already expected this. He stayed in the Demigod Wine Cellar for a long time and even went as far as undergoing his tribulation inside. He worried about this, and wanted to increase his strength before coming out. But he never expected that they all fell into the Blood Moon Sect’s trap instead.

“Nirvana Banquet’s champion, you’re finally out!” The Fire God General descended to the ground and viciously looked at Lin Yun. He didn’t bother concealing the murderous aura within his pupils.

“It appears that you have not learned your lesson back in the Black Tortoise Vault.” Lin Yun smiled with a chill flashing within his pupils.

“You’re almighty back in the Black Tortoise Vault with the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown on. Why don’t you bring it out now? I’ll give you a chance to put it on.” The Fire God General mocked.

“You want to take revenge?” Lin Yun said, raising his eyes.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“You’re really arrogant. Do you really think you’re a figure just because my cultivation was suppressed back at the Black Tortoise Void Sea?” The Fire God General said with an eerie expression. When he looked at Lin Yun, there was a hint of mockery and fury blazing within his pupils. Lin Yun was clearly an ant-like existence before him. Even if Lin Yun was first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, he was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm. But he had suffered great humiliation at the hands of Lin Yun back in the Black Tortoise Vault.

“Your gaze is annoying. Let me see if you can still maintain your arrogance after I dig those eyes out!” The Fire God General eerily said. As he flew out, his roar that contained his murderous aura swept out, along with his aura at the third stage Profound Death Stage.

When Huang Xuanyi saw this scene, a sinister smile rose on his lips because Lin Yun would probably die a terrible death at the hands of the Fire God General.

Yan Chihuo, Yi Feng, and the others opened their mouths with complicated expressions, but they all had pity on their faces. Even if Lin Yun’s fortune was heaven-defying, they didn’t think he had a way out of this situation.

Lin Yun was calm as he raised his head and looked at the Fire God General charging at him. If it were before he underwent his tribulation, Lin Yun would have had great trouble facing those at the pinnacle Profound Life Stage, not to mention someone at the third stage Profound Death Stage. But he was now a lot stronger than he was before, and these people were destined to be disappointed.

As a golden-purple radiance shone from his body, Lin Yun left behind afterimages as he took three steps forth and suddenly turned around. His speed had reached a terrifying height. When he turned around, his vitality was like a ferocious beast. He left behind ripples in the air, and this caused the Fire God General to miss his attack.

“What’s going on? Isn’t he a little too fast?!” The Fire God General passed through the afterimages, and he was deeply shocked. He was certain that Lin Yun wasn’t so fast back in the Black Tortoise Vault. But Lin Yun was even faster without the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown?

“I don’t believe it!” Although the Fire God General was shocked, he was still at the third stage Profound Death Stage. He was confident that Lin Yun would lose if they clashed head-on.

The Fire God General soared to the sky with a crimson palm blooming from his palm. As a blood moon rose to the sky behind him, the blood moon became shrouded in a terrifying deathly aura, as well as a boundless dragon origin. He had fully unleashed his cultivation behind this palm, and he was confident that Lin Yun could do nothing besides running upon facing his attack.

But Lin Yun merely squinted his eyes and pushed his palm forth.

“Ha.” The Fire God General sneered with mockery filling his pupils. He coldly said, “How ignorant. I’ll sever one of your arms first!”
