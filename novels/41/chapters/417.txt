Chapter 418 - Strike Back

Lin Yun’s voice wasn’t loud, but he had instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

“Senior Brother Lin!”

“It’s really Senior Brother Lin! Wasn’t he locked up by Guardian Plum?”

“It looks like Guardian Plum didn’t punish him after all. But can Senior Brother Lin defeat this person? Luo Yuhang feels unbelievably strong and Senior Brother Chen couldn’t even put up any resistance.”

“Luo Yuhang might be strong, but that doesn’t mean that the Sword Firmament Pavilion has no one else.” The plaza instantly boiled, but many disciples also felt worried for Lin Yun at the same time.

If everyone had doubts about Luo Yuhang’s strength before the previous fight, they no longer dared to underestimate him after witnessing how he defeated Chen Xuanjun. After all, he was Twilight’s junior brother.

“Lin Yun?” Ye Feng and Luo Yuhang’s brows twitched when they looked at Lin Yun. Although they never met prior to this, they had long heard of Lin Yun’s fame.

This is Lin Yun? Ye Feng fell into deep thought. He had been hearing two names pretty often ever since he came back. One was Bai Lixuan and the other was Lin Yun. But after he heard of their accomplishments, he wasn’t surprised that everyone had forgotten about his existence. After all, the two of them were simply too outstanding.

Before Bai Lixuan obtained his Saint Physique, he had already displayed unbelievable talent. But Lin Yun only appeared a year ago and he had accomplished everything in under a year.

Lin Yun tapped his foot on the ground and gently landed beside Chen Xuanjun.

“Junior brother, be careful. There’s something weird about his sword technique,” warned Chen Xuanjun.

“You’re Lin Yun?” Luo Yuhang looked at Lin Yun with interest, but there weren’t any fluctuations on his face.

“Yes,” he responded.

“You’re unlike the others. You had boundless prospects before you shattered your profound vein, but it’s a pity. Your upper limit has already been determined now. I heard that the Myriad Treasure Pavilion even used you as a bet. I advise you not to participate in the Dragon Gate Competition. Otherwise, you might be killed before you even encounter the crown prince.” Luo Yuhang spoke in an aloof tone that made everyone uncomfortable.

Lin Yun also couldn’t be bothered to be polite with Luo Yuhang. He replied, “My participation in the Dragon Gate Competition has nothing to do with an outsider. You only need to know that I’m here to spar.”

“You find my words unpleasant?” Luo Yuhang scoffed and continued, “Alright. Let me teach you how to behave before the Dragon Gate Competition. I won’t bully you, I’ll suppress my cultivation to the eighth stage.”

A cold sneer flashed in his eyes that was even more arrogant than when he fought Chen Xuanjun. The provocation in his words was obvious.

Xin Yan frowned her brows beneath the stage. Lin Yun had already revealed almost all his trump cards previously and Luo Yuhang clearly came prepared.

Luo Yuhang began to suppress his cultivation to the pinnacle eighth stage. He wanted to defeat Lin Yun in this matter and use the latter as a stepping stone.

All the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples looked at Lin Yun and they could feel an immense pressure. However, Lin Yun stood there calm and composed.

“Please,” said Lin Yun, looking at Luo Yuhang.

“As you wish.” Luo Yuhang drew his sword and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. This battle concerned the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s honor, so everyone couldn’t help but feel nervous.

With the Dragon Gate Competition approaching, any commotion that occurred now would sweep the entire city instantly. If Lin Yun was defeated by someone in the same cultivation, it would surely spread throughout the Heavenly Qin County in one night.

Lin Yun and Luo Yuhang were locked in a stalemate as they waited for each other to reveal a flaw.

“You’re not going to attack?” Luo Yuhang was surprised that Lin Yun didn’t launch an attack at him first. He then sneered, “Then you won’t have any chance to draw your sword.”

Luo Yuhang gathered his sword intent and he drew his sword. In that moment, a horrifying sword aura exploded from him. A bright radiance soon followed when he stabbed his sword forward. He was using the same attack he used to defeat Chen Xuanjun.

“Supreme Radiance Sword—Daylight!” Someone recognized Luo Yuhang’s sword technique from the previous fight. The Supreme Radiance Sword was a transcendent spiritual grade sword technique of the Sword Cloud Pavilion. It was well known in the Great Qin Empire many years ago. It required high comprehension to practice.

The sword ray was like a dazzling sun. But just when it was about to reach Lin Yun, it started to alternate between darkness and light. It wasn’t easy trying to get used to the drastic changes.

“This again!”

“I’m afraid that Lin Yun will lose just like Senior Brother Chen if he isn’t able to see Luo Yuhang.”

Many disciples had a bad premonition. But right at this moment, a clear sword buzz rang out with snow exploding out. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When Lin Yun avoided the attack, he threw out a punch at the same time. The punch seemed to have caught the flaw in Luo Yuhang’s attack. However, Luo Yuhang reacted in time and swung his sword again, showing just how formidable he was.

“This is a terrifying fellow!” An exclamation broke out in the plaza because Luo Yuhang had instantly converted his disadvantage into his advantage. Just this alone proved that it wasn’t an injustice for Chen Xuanjun to lose.

Lin Yun instantly avoided it with the Seven Profound Steps, but Luo Yuhang kept shattering Lin Yun’s afterimages and compressed Lin Yun’s space.

Using the Seven Profound Steps’ Golden Crow Seal, Lin Yun’s figure flashed around the stage throwing out punches occasionally. In the blink of an eye, the two had already exchanged over ten moves.

Everyone beneath the stage was shocked as they watched this battle. The battle slowly sped up and Lin Yun continued to fend off Luo Yuhang calmly with his punches.

“Supreme Solar!” Luo Yuhang finally lost his patience and brought out his strongest attack. His sword instantly unleashed a bright radiance like the sun that had the might to annihilate everything.

The sword aura from his attack was too powerful and even Lin Yun was forced to take several steps back. No one had expected that Luo Yuhang’s attack would be so terrifying. This was clearly a sign that his sword technique had reached complete mastery.

“Kill!” Killing intent flickered in Luo Yuhang’s eyes and he swung his sword out.

“Dragon-Tiger Fist!” Lin Yun faced Luo Yuhang’s attack head-on.

The two clashed nine times, but Lin Yun couldn’t obtain any advantage without his sword. After nine clashes, he was pushed to the edge of the stage. He was only half a step away from falling down.

Although the radiance in Luo Yuhang’s attack had dimmed, his sword aura was still powerful. The corner of Luo Yuhang’s lips curled and he sneered, “This is the genius of the Sword Firmament Pavilion? You’re not so impressive after all. Sit down!”

“Senior Brother Lin Yun is going to lose!” The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples exclaimed out. But right at this moment, Lin Yun charged forward instead of retreating.

“Three seals into one!” Lin Yun formed the Undying Vajra Seal, Sky Breaking Seal, and Demon Vanquishing Seal. His aura instantly suppressed Luo Yuhang and even the radiance from Luo Yuhang’s attack paled in comparison. The differences were like a firefly and the sun.

Lin Yun rarely used the Dragon-Tiger Fist anymore after he obtained the quasi-xiantian sword intent, but that didn’t mean that the Dragon-Tiger Fist was weak. It was a famous martial technique in the Great Qin Empire and Lin Yun had already reached complete mastery in it. Furthermore, he even used his sword intent to complement the marital technique even more.

Facing Luo Yuhang’s domineering sword, Lin Yun used an even more domineering attack to suppress him. When the three combined seals descended, it instantly shattered Luo Yuhang’s attack.

“No!” cried Luo Yuhang. When Lin Yun’s gaze passed through the radiance, he could see Luo Yuhang retreating.

“Do you think you can run?” Lin Yun charged forward and threw a punch at Luo Yuhang’s wrist.

When Luo Yuhang’s sword fell to the ground, a cold light flickered in Lin Yun’s eyes, “You lost.”

Not only did Luo Yuhang lose, he even lost in a terrible state. After all, Lin Yun didn’t even draw his sword throughout the entire fight.

“This is impossible!” Luo Yuhang’s eyes flashed with reluctance and his aura suddenly surged, reaching the ninth stage. He wanted to recover his cultivation to suppress Lin Yun.

“You’re courting death.” A cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes and his aura also surged before Luo Yuhang’s cultivation could return to the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm.

When the Iris Flower in his dantian blossomed, Lin Yun threw out his strongest punch. Taking Lin Yun’s attack head-on before he could recover all of his cultivation, Luo Yuhang was sent flying away and throwing up blood.

“Didn’t you say that you’re suppressing your cultivation in the eighth stage? So the genius of the Sword Cloud Pavilion likes to slap himself in the face?” Mockery flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes as he looked at Luo Yuhang coldly while emitting a pressure in the ninth stage.

“Junior Brother, you restored your cultivation?!” Xin Yan’s eyes lit up when she saw this scene.

The other Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples also rejoiced when they recovered from their shock. Lin Yun, whom everyone said had reached his limit after shattering his profound vein, had actually restored his cultivation.
