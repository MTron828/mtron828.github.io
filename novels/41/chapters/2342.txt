Chapter 2343 - Unbearable

It was true that the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity was acquainted with the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity. More accurately, the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity helped the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity in the past, or Lin Yun and Ji Zixi wouldn’t have been able to come to the Heavenly Barren Realm.

“Let’s go. I can sense that many people have noticed us,” Lin Yun said. Ever since they entered the city, there were countless gazes on them, especially on him. He even attracted more attention than the two women, and he could roughly guess why. It appeared that what happened on Qilin Mountain had already spread around.

Not only did he defeat Wang Jue, but he even obtained Golden Dao Fruits. But Lin Yun didn’t care about that. He would be climbing the mountain, meaning his identity would be disclosed sooner or later. So, he didn’t hide his identity on purpose.

After they jumped down the city wall, they headed over to the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain. There seemed to be a rule in Heavenly Barren City. This was because no one came after them, despite attracting so much attention.

But the moment they left the city, they were stopped by a group of people. Everyone in this group gave off a powerful aura and looked prideful. Seeing the person leading the party, Lin Jiangxian’s face changed with a smear of chill flashing across her eyes.

“They seem to be from an Ancient Divine Clan,” Xiong Tiannan said.

Lin Yun also noticed that they gave off a noble aura, as if heaven blessed them.

“Lin Jiangxian, we meet again!” The one leading the party was a woman in purple clothes with a voluptuous figure. She wore a smile, looking at Lin Jiangxian with provocation in her eyes.

“Gu Yuxin, I advise you to leave here immediately,” Lin Jiangxian said coldly. The Gu Clan was amongst the most prestigious Ancient Divine Clans, with a deity who was still around. Their clan had an inheritance of tens of thousands of years, possessing a solid foundation. But even Ancient Divine Clans would be divided into direct and branch lineages, and Gu Yuxin wasn’t from the direct lineage.

Gu Yuxin scoffed, “Your temper hasn’t changed one bit. If you submitted to my cousin, you wouldn’t have been expelled from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s headquarters, and you wouldn’t have to stay together with so many barbarians. But I’m not here for you today.”

She turned to look at Lin Yun, and smiled, “I've heard that you have obtained several Golden Dao Fruits from the Sovereign Monument. Come, let me have a look at them.”

“I have already refined them. Only an idiot would keep them around. Would you keep them around if you had them?” Lin Yun smiled.

When Gu Yuxin looked at Lin Yun, she could sense a deep and unfathomable feeling coming from him. She sneered, “Nine Golden Dao Fruits. Can you refine all of them by yourself? Do you think that I’m stupid?”

Their confrontation drew attention from the surroundings and everyone’s gazes fell on Lin Yun.

“He’s Flower Burial Lin Yun?”

“I heard that he not only defeated a divine disciple, Wang Jue, but he even obtained nine Golden Dao Fruits.”

“Someone probably has their eyes on him already, and Gu Yuxin is probably here to probe him...”

“That’s the confidence of a Divine Clan, and anyone can tell they’re not pushovers.”

“That’s right. I can’t imagine that he came from a barbaric realm.”

Everyone looked at Lin Yun, who didn’t bother concealing his strength. He gave off the feeling that he was a powerful sword that was hard to conceal even if he tried.

After all, anyone who could come to Heavenly Barren Mountain was considered a genius, and they naturally had some eyesight.

“Why don’t you come and search me if you don’t believe me?” Lin Yun wasn’t furious and spread his arms apart.

Gu Yuxin became doubtful when she looked at Lin Yun. But she wasn’t a fool, so she coldly said, “You really know how to conceal yourself. But if you really have the ability, let me see how far you can go in the three stages. You dare come even after offending Wang Jue? I bet you don’t know how ‘death’ is spelled!”

“What did you say?!” Xiong Tiannan was furious.

“Am I wrong? We’ll see.” Gu Yuxin sneered, then she left.

While watching this group leaving, Ji Zixi and Xiong Tiannan became furious.

Lin Yun turned to Lin Jiangxian, and asked, “You’re kicked out from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s headquarters?”

“I left on my own. The atmosphere there isn’t good, but it would seem as though I was kicked out in the eyes of others,” Lin Jiangxian said.

Lin Yun finally realized that the Heavenly Sword Pavilion might be an immortal holy land. But the situation was similar to the Heavenly Dao Sect, with clans dividing the powers. So, someone with no background and from a low birth, like Lin Jiangxian, would naturally suffer suppression.

“Lin Yun, that woman is too arrogant. Why don’t we intimidate her a little? Otherwise, there might be endless troubles,” Xiong Tiannan said.

“Don’t worry about her and just climb the mountain,” Lin Yun said calmly as he headed towards Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain.

An hour later, they reached the foot of the mountain with the surroundings filled with people. All the geniuses from the various realms have gathered here. This was the first time Lin Yun saw so many saints gathered in one place.

Xiong Tiannan asked around and found out that the first stage was the Deity Slaughter Monument. There was a monument at the waist of the mountain that was rumored to have killed a deity before. One would pass the first stage if they managed to leave their names on this monument.

There were three stages, and the ten who made it through could participate in the Heavenly Barren Banquet. Now that the test has started, they must reach the Deity Slaughter Monument with no time limit. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“The Ancient Divine Clans are here.” An exclamation resounded that drew everyone’s attention.

“That’s Gu Jun? He's the strongest genius of the Gu Clan’s younger generation.”

“The Ancient Divine Clans practically sent everyone from the younger generation.”

“Haha, the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity is taking in a disciple, and even becoming his outer disciple could allow the Gu Clan to give birth to another deity.”

“I heard that three years ago, Gu Jun had already become a seventh-stage Saint Lord, ranking in the top hundred on the Brandished Dragon Ranking.”

Discussions resounded around, making Lin Yun curious before seeing a youth walking up the steps. He donned an indigo-gold robe, looking extraordinary with his eyes shining brightly. There were forty cultivators in his group, and no one dared to stand in their way.

Xiong Tiannan explained, “The Ancient Divine Clan has a terrifying foundation that far exceeds our imagination. Their direct descendants are popular in the various immortal holy lands. Only Heaven's Gate would have a test.”

When someone heard that, they smiled, “This is the test of the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity. It’s naturally hard to become his disciple, and descendants of an Ancient Divine Clan are nothing in the eyes of someone like the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity.

What he said wasn’t wrong because how could someone possessing a deity’s bloodline compare to someone in the Ancestral Realm? As time flowed, more Ancient Divine Clans arrived, along with geniuses from various immortal holy lands and divine disciples.

Fifteen minutes later, everyone came to the stairs leading to the Deity Slaughter Monument. These stairs were long, with over ninety steps, and there was only a rough outline of the Deity Slaughter Monument that could be seen from afar, giving off tremendous pressure. Anyone climbing the stairs would feel tremendous pressure, making every step difficult.

People would occasionally fall from the stairs and become covered in blood. Some resisted the pressure and sped up the stairs to leave their names on the Deity Slaughter Monument. After all, who wouldn’t want to be the first and become famous? Who knows, they might even draw the attention of the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity.

“It looks like you’re nothing impressive after all.” A voice resounded. It came from Gu Yuxin. She looked at Lin Yun with a provoking gaze as she swiftly climbed the stairs, drawing cheers from the surroundings.

“Gu Yuxin is only a disciple of the branch lineage, but she has such strength. It looks like the Ancient Divine Clan has a deep and unfathomable foundation.”

“So they’re from a Divine Clan. It's no wonder why they’re so cocky.”

Gu Yuxin wore a smug expression after hearing the surrounding discussions. She liked being at the center of attention. She climbed over two hundred steps in one go. She then turned back and looked at Lin Jiangxian with a provoking smile, “Lin Jiangxian, you were a genius in the past, but why have you become so weak? You can’t even catch up to me when I don't even use my full strength.”

Ji Zixi saw the contempt in Gu Yuxin’s gaze and became furious because she was too much.

A chill began to gather in Lin Jiangxian’s eyes. She had always been a straightforward person and wouldn’t hold it in. But she was with Lin Yun right now, and she didn’t want to cause any trouble for him. As a result, she endured Gu Yuxin’s provocation.

Right then, Lin Yun’s voice resounded, “If it’s unbearable, there’s no need to bear it. Why would swordsmen like us fear the Divine Clans? If we show fear, would there be any meaning even if we became the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity’s disciple?”

Lin Jiangxian looked at Lin Yun, and she smiled, “It looks like you’re also a troublemaker.”

“Perhaps,” Lin Yun smiled with a wink, looking dashing.

Lin Jiangxian felt that Lin Yun was more pleasing to the eye, and she smiled, “You’re right. If it becomes unbearable, there’s no need to bear it. After all, why would swordsmen like us fear a fight?”

She soared to the sky and passed by Gu Yuxin. This naturally shocked Gu Yuxin, but she soon calmed down because the Ancient Divine Clans were all here. She might have feared Lin Yun earlier, but not with so many people around.

Furthermore, it was only Lin Jiangxian and not Lin Yun who defeated a divine disciple. She smiled, “You seem unconvinced? You’re garbage who was chased out of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s headquarters. Do you still think that you’re the same genius from back then?”

Lin Jiangxian raised her brow with her hair fluttering in the wind. As a sword vibration echoed from Lin Jiangxian’s body, thunderstorms began to gather from the surrounding, “You’re right. My sword has never been convinced.”

Raising her hand, lightning gathered in her palm with five-colored dragons around her before she pushed his palm forth, tearing the space before her apart.
