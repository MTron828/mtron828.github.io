Chapter 2130: True Dragon Palace

Mo Li was in a daze for a long time and hadn’t come to his senses. He had hidden a lot of his strength and was cautious. He came to the True Dragon Secret Realm to be the champion of the True Dragon Ranking. But he didn’t expect to suffer such a huge loss even before the real fight began. The silver coffin was gone, and he was tricked with the saint fruit.

Cao Yang smiled and was naturally happy to see Mo Li’s expression. After all, Mo Li always thought highly of himself, thinking that everyone in the world was a fool if he didn’t suffer a little. He said, “Ye Qingtian cannot be underestimated.”

Mo Li’s emotions calmed down, and he kept the saint fruit. He said, “Indeed, that person cannot be underestimated, and he might even be an underdog. Those from the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking who want to obtain a benefit here might suffer a huge loss if they’re not careful.”

“From now on, you have another opponent aside from the likes of Xiao Hongfei and Fang Haotian,” Cao Yang smiled.

“My opponent? You have underestimated me. My opponents have always been the champions of the nine heavenly paths, and the True Dragon Secret Realm is only a springboard for me!” Mo Li said pridefully.

Cao Yang was taken aback because he didn’t know where Mo Li got his confidence. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Lin Yun emerged from the bronze palace's shadows after Mo Li and Cao Yang left. Mo Li was right; he didn’t leave the bronze palace and purposely created the crack to lure them away.

“Empress, what did you find in the silver coffin?” Lin Yun asked.

“This is a replica of the Eternal Divine Coffin, so let’s call it the Eternal Saint Coffin. The demonspirit clan can preserve their physiques, resisting the flow of time and extending their lifespan. If it’s the demonspirit clan, they can cultivate in it, achieving twice the result with half the effort. It’ll be a different story if it’s the Eternal Divine Coffin, and it’s rumored to grant a second life,” Lil’ Purple said as she examined the silver coffin. It had a huge origin but didn’t seem useful to Lin Yun.

“That means that only those from the demonspirit clan or running out of their lifespan can use it?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right. It’s useless to you, but it’s a treasure for those who need it. After all, it can extend one’s lifespan. If you can make a breakthrough inside or buy time until someone brings you something that can extend your lifespan, it’s equivalent to another life,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“Let’s leave it for now, then. Who knows if I might need it,” Lin Yun smiled.

“What are you talking about? Touchwood!” Lil’ Purple said nervously.

Lin Yun smiled as he began to sort out his harvest. So far, he obtained an Eternal Saint Coffin, a Dragon Clan’s bracelet, an innate saint fruit, a few precious saint herbs, and the Black Thunder Chains that became a Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact. His harvest was already heaven-defying, and no one would believe it if he said it out. After all, no one could receive such a huge harvest, especially the innate saint fruit.

“Empress, this innate saint fruit should be able to help me reach the Quasi-Saint Realm, right?” Lin Yun asked, wanting to verify it again.

“There’s a high chance,” Lil’ Purple said, but she wasn’t absolutely confident about it.

“Got it.” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he made up his mind.

Four hours later, Lin Yun left the mysterious underground palace and landed on a faraway mountain. Down below was a lush valley with a ferocious fight taking place. Seven holy lands’ saint disciples were attacking a swordsman, and a person was lying on the ground beside that swordsman.

Fang Shaoling, I have already given you the saint herbs. So, do you still want to take it that far?” The swordsman roared. He was the Sword Sect’s Gongsun Yan, and the one lying on the ground was the Sword Fanatic Zhao Yan.

The leader of the seven saint disciples smiled, “So what can you do to me? It’s the law of the jungle in the secret realm, and you can only die since you’re weak. This is how unreasonable the world is, and you can only blame the Sword Sect for being too weak. Does a powerful sect dare to face a holy land? Would you have this outcome if you begged for mercy earlier?”

This person’s cultivation in the Indigo Origin Phase gave off a powerful aura, but he had a wound on his face.

Gongsun Yan’s gaze became dark, and he said, “If you didn’t launch a sneak attack, do you think you would injure Senior Brother Zhao? So it turns out that the geniuses of the holy lands are just a bunch of shameless people.”

Fang Shaoling’s face became sinister, and he said, “I can’t be bothered to waste time with you. Kill him!”

He was unhappy because he was injured on his face even after launching a sneak attack and nearly losing his life. This was why he had no intentions of letting them off, even if he obtained their saint herbs.

The six holy lands immediately surrounded Gongsun Yan. The latter could barely take care of himself, not to mention he had to protect Zhao Yan. So, it didn’t take long for him to land in a disadvantageous position.

“Die!” Fang Shaoling found the right opportunity and waved his hand, manifesting a demonic claw enveloped in black flames that flew at Gongsun Yan’s head. Just when the demonic claw was about to crush Gongsun Yan’s head, a sword ray flew over and tore apart the demonic claw, forcing Fang Shaoling and the six people with him to retreat.

“What a powerful sword aura!” Fang Shaoling was surprised as he looked at his palm. He had only come in contact with it, and a wound was on his hand.

“Ye Qingtian!” Gongsun Yan was shocked when he turned around. Even Zhao Yan raised his head to the ground and looked at Lin Yun.

“Senior Brother Zhao, you’re injured.” Lin Yun frowned.

Zhao Yan smiled bitterly, “Even the True Dragon Secret Realm is filled with geniuses. Aside from Senior Sister Ye, I’m afraid no one can leave their names on the Blue Dragon Record.”

He didn’t mention that he lost to a sneak attack because this also meant he wasn’t strong enough. This made Gongsun Yan widen his eyes because he didn’t know when Zhao Yan and Ye Qingtian had such a good relationship.

“The last on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking, Ye Qingtian?” Fang Shaoling finally knew why the sword intent was so terrifying. Ye Qingtian was a prodigy swordsman in the Heavenly Dao Sect and didn’t dare to look down on this person. He said, “Ye Qingtian, even if you’re a prodigy swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect, you must give me a saint herb if you want to save them.”

“You know my name and still dare to be so arrogant? It looks like you have your confidence,” Lin Yun said.

Fang Shaoling sneered, “Your name? What name? Holy Maiden Killer? You’re just an add-on to the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking. On the other hand, my elder brother, Fang Haotian, is ranked sixty-third! A difference of ten rankings is equivalent to a gulf, so where did you get the confidence to be so arrogant from?”

Lin Yun sneered, “Where did you get your confidence from? Talk to me again after you can take my sword.”

“Go at him together! He must have a lot of treasures with him. He’s only one person, and he’s not even a Quasi-Saint. So there’s no need to be afraid of him!” All seven of them had murderous intent radiating from their eyes. This wasn’t the first time they did this, as they were madmen in the True Dragon Secret Realm, running rampant and doing what they wanted.

“Die.” Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword and swung his blade. This attack had no fancy sword technique as it was empowered with Astral Sword Intent and his cultivation in the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. As the two glory spirits radiated, the six Quasi-Saints in the Azure Origin Phase were severed into two. Fang Shaoling managed to hold on for a little longer, but he still couldn’t escape the fate of being severed.

“What the hell? Killing seven Quasi-Saints with one sword?” Gongsun Yan exclaimed. He knew that Ye Qingtian was strong, but he didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to be strong enough to kill a Quasi-Saint in the Indigo Origin Phase with one sword after two months. This could no longer be explained as a genius as Ye Qingtian was still in the Nirvana Stage. A certain speculation appeared in his mind, and he exclaimed, “Tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage?”

Lin Yun didn’t hide it and nodded.

When Gongsun Yan was stumped, Zhao Yan rejoiced, “The tenth transformation of the Nirvana stage can face Quasi-Saints in the Azure Origin Phase. In addition to your sword intent, you don’t have to be afraid of those in the Indigo Origin Phase!”

Zhao Yan was genuinely happy for Lin Yun to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. Even without reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm, Lin Yun could leave his name on the Blue Dragon Record. Seeing how Lin Yun easily killed Fang Shaoling, proved that Lin Yun’s sword intent had strengthened. Unlike Gongsun Yan, Zhao Yan knew about Lin Yun’s real identity, which was why he was happy.

“Treat your injuries first.” Lin Yun treated Zhao Yan’s injuries with the Blue Dragon Bone, and it didn’t take long for Zhao Yan to stabilize his injuries, recovering half of his fighting prowess.

“B-Brother Ye, Fang Shaoling is the younger brother of Fang Haotian. Shouldn’t we leave this place first?” Gongsun Yan asked in a concerned tone after he came to his senses.

“It’s fine,” Lin Yun replied. “Where are those from the Sword Sect? Is Ye Ziling alright?”

Gongsun Yan now knew why Ye Qingtian would save them. So the latter was a lecher, as rumored. But just when hesitating to reply, Zhao Yan already spoke out, “Senior Sister Ye is fine. We said to meet at the True Dragon Palace. The space there is distorted, but we’ll run into each other as long as he carries on. But it still hasn’t appeared and may take some time.”

Zhao Yan explained. The True Dragon Palace was the most dangerous location in the True Dragon Secret Realm, and most treasures could be found there. Everyone has already hunted demonic beasts in the Quasi-Saint Realm, and they could crush the Quasi-Saint beast core to be transported out if they were in danger.

Seven-colored radiance shot to the sky two days later, accompanied by a dragon roar.

“The True Dragon Palace has appeared!” Gongsun Yan said in excitement. Many cultivators wouldn’t be able to leave their names on the Blue Dragon Record no matter how they tried, so they might aim to obtain treasures instead. This was also Gongsun Yan’s goal.

The radiance attracted everyone’s attention in the True Dragon Secret Realm. When it appeared, Lin Yun’s group of three rushed toward the True Dragon Palace.

“Over there!” Gongsun Yan pointed out.

There was a mountain enveloped in seven-colored radiance, and it was a towering place that pierced into the clouds. There were many people gathered in the surroundings. The dragon aura released by the palace was massive, and no one dared to charge recklessly.

“Ye Qingtian?” Just when the three were looking at the True Dragon Palace, a group of people came over as Ye Ziling led those from the Sword Sect.

“Senior Sister Ye, are you alright?” Gongsun Yasn asked.

“Hehe, what can happen to us with Senior Sister Ye around? Did you guys run into any trouble?”

“We ran into some troubles along the way, but fortunately, we ran into Ye Qingtian.” The disciples of the Sword Sect had a good relationship, and Lin Yun saw many familiar faces. They were all disciples of the Heavenly Ranking.

There were their formal chief disciple, Mu Qingqing, and Mu Xueqin. As they chatted among themselves, they neglected Lin Yun instead.

But Lin Yun merely wore a smile because he knew he would frighten them if he revealed his identity. Suddenly, he sensed a gaze directed at him from Ye Ziling. The latter looked at him with a complicated gaze, making Lin Yun wonder if Ye Ziling had recognized him.
