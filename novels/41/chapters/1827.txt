Chapter 1828 - Gu Jun

Lin Yun had never felt Gu Jun’s voice being so intimidating before. He quickly reacted by slamming his palm on the ground and using the force behind him to soar to the sky. At this critical moment, he brushed past the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, and was already a thousand meters away in the next breath.

But before he could take another step forth, a powerful suction force appeared from his back. The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was dragging him over with a wave of his hand. Accompanying it was a majestic power that couldn’t be resisted, and Lin Yun was being dragged over. Although he used his sword intent to resist, he was still slowly moving backward.

But Lin Yun was surprised because he couldn’t see Gu Jun anywhere.

“Brat, hold on for a while more. Run!” Gu Jun’s voice resounded.

Lin Yun nearly threw out a mouthful of blood when he heard that because Gu Jun really never disappointed him. Even if he wanted to run, could he?

“Azure Dragon Descend!” Rage flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils and turned around as a hundred thousand golden-purple dragon runes flew out from his body. When the golden-purple dragon runes left his body, they manifested into a hundred foot-long azure dragon to clash with the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s suction force head-on.

A bizarre scene then occurred and the azure dragon was distorted under this powerful suction force, slowly shrinking in size. Under the suction force, the azure dragon let out a wail before it was ultimately crushed by the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

But Lin Yun had long expected this scene. When the azure dragon was crushed, Lin Yun executed the Azure Dragon Grasp with his palm and pushed out. As thunderclouds covered the sky, it looked as though there was an ancient azure dragon within them.

When Lin Yun’s palm descended, a massive claw shrouded in a thunderstorm descended upon the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. This made the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit let out a scream, and the demonspirit’s pupils shone with a demonic light.

The demonic light pierced through the claw, and was still flickering with silver lightning. Then, the demonic light formed a beam that charged into the sea of lightning, destroying the azure dragon within the thunderclouds.

As a shockwave spread out, the thunderclouds were swept away, leaving behind the demonic light and lightning that still wreaked havoc in the sky.

“How brutal…” The corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitched. This was the first time he had seen someone resolving an attack in this manner. This Silver-Eyed Demonspirit did not seem to be much different from the demonic corpses from earlier and hadn’t reached the Profound Death Stage. Then again, it wasn’t their cultivation when they were alive but current cultivation.

But this Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was unbelievably stronger than the previous demonic corpse. Just when Lin Yun wanted to bring out the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, countless thunderbolts descended from the sky.

The entire sky was like a silver lightning lake, and the water consisted of lightning magma. As multiple lightning bolts descended from the sky, a figure hovered in the sky like a saint.

“Gu Jun?” Lin Yun was surprised and wondered if this old man had gotten stronger. But it felt weird because the old man’s original cultivation was at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage, and he could reach the Quasi-Saint any time. Not to mention he also grasped the Great Saint Tune. But he had just sealed his cultivation at the Profound Life Stage for the time being. But he could now unleash more power.

The Black Tortoise Totem? Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, and he soon thought of something.

“Hundred thousand thunderbolts, heed my order!” Gu Jun hovered in the air with his hands clasped together as a hundred thousand thunderbolts condensed to form a Thunder Black Tortoise.

The tortoiseshell was flickering with a black luster, and the runes on it were filled with a chill. But that wasn’t all, there was a demonic snake coiled around it, and its pupils were flickering with black lightning.

The Thunder Black Tortoise looked as though it traveled through time from the Golden Era to the present. It then teleported over to the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit and sent it flying away when they collided. The demonic aura released by the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was like snow slowly being dissolved, and its aura had greatly declined.

“Gu Jun, are you still going to claim that you’re not a descendant of the Black Tortoise?” Lin Yun said.

After Gu Jun sent the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit flying away, he carried the Black Tortoise Totem and charged forth. He seemed to have completely refined the Black Tortoise Totem, and it had become a staff in his hand. This sacred artifact might have shrunk in size, but it was still powerful.

When Gu Jun and the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit collided, an earth-shattering battle occurred, and a giant Black Tortoise appeared behind them. On the other hand, a silver radiance shone with demonic radiance covering the entire sky.

When the silver radiance shone down, the ground looked as though it was covered with silver lightning as multiple demonic beams that have reached a thousand feet soared to the sky and created multiple cracks.

Seeing this scene, Lin Yun was both surprised and relieved. He quickly sat down and circulated the Blue Dragon Bone to produce more dragon runes to swiftly replace the already shattered ones. By the time Lin Yun reopened his eyes, he had recovered a hundred thousand dragon runes, and healed his injuries.

As he let out a breath, no one could tell he was heavily injured earlier. When he saw Gu Jun returning, Lin Yun asked, “You resolved it?”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“In your dreams. Run!” Gu Jun didn’t bother looking at Lin Yun and limpingly ran for his life. Only then did Lin Yun realize one of Gu Jun’s legs was broken with blood flowing out.

When Lin Yun’s face changed and raised his head, he could hear a demonic howl that made heaven and earth tremble. Lin Yun quickly chased after Gu Jun without any hesitation. But even after Gu Jun became limp, he still had a terrifying speed, and Lin Yun had to exert great effort to barely catch up with him.

“I’m really impressed by how fast you are when you’re already limp.” Lin Yun said.

“What do you know about? This is my capability. You can try to make yourself limp and see if you can catch up to me.” Gu Jun smiled.

“Shut up.” Lin Yun glanced at the old man.

“Hehe.” Gu Jun smiled. “But how did you lure this monster over? Mei Zihua, that unlucky brat, wasn’t as unlucky as you.”

Mei Zihua? Where did that fellow go? Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he replied, “I don’t know. It ignored everyone else and chased after me!”

“It’s really lured over by you?! Shit. Let’s run separately.” Gu Jun glanced at Lin Yun with disdain before running in another direction.

Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered by Gu Jun, and could only blame himself for blurting that out. He should’ve long guessed what kind of person this old man was. Thus, he could only muster all his strength to run at full speed. He had to shake it off quickly or he wouldn’t even have anywhere to go in the Heavenly Thunder Palace.

As a silver demonic ray descended, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit descended from the sky and glanced in two different directions with a struggling expression. But in the end, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit decided to chase after Gu Jun.

An hour later, when Lin Yun noticed the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit wasn’t following behind him, this made him feel baffled, and he began to wonder if he really shook it off. But just when he was pondering over it, Gu Jun appeared out of nowhere and smiled, “I finally found you!”

“Where’s the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit?” Lin Yun asked.

“Look behind you.” Gu Jun nudged his lips.

When Lin Yun turned around, his face instantly became pale because the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit had appeared once again.

“You lured it over?” Lin Yun roared.

“What are you talking about? Do you think I’m that kind of person? I’m just afraid that something might happen to you. After all, Saint Elder and the Profound Fairy won’t let me off if anything happens to you.” Gu Jun said.

“Get away from me if you care about me.” Lin Yun rebuked. As he spoke, he began to distance himself from Gu Jun.

When he distanced from Gu Jun, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit went after Gu Jun and ignored him. And yet, this old man still claims that he isn’t a descendant of the Black Tortoise? But Lin Yun had underestimated how shameless Gu Jun could be. He was following behind Lin Yun.

“Go away!” Lin Yun roared, looking at the terrifying demonic aura behind him.

Squinting his eyes, Gu Jun smiled, “Hehe. Don’t think that you can shake me off. You have a lot of treasures, and it’s definitely the safest to follow you!”

Perhaps because Lin Yun managed to kill the Wind Edge Lord’s party, this made Gu Jun firmly believe that Lin Yun must have a trump card or he wouldn’t have come to the Black Tortoise Void Sea alone. This instantly made Lin Yun’s face become black.

The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit suddenly made a move. When its palm descended, the two left at the same time and the spot it hit was instantly corroded by the demonic aura, creating a huge crater on the ground.

Seeing this, the corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched. This Silver-Eyed Demonspirit possessed the Black Tortoise’s inheritance and the strength of the Demonspirit Clan. It was genuinely a monster, so they would have to give up running away now.

Gu Jun calmly took out a shield and raised it above his head like a house, and this made Lin Yun’s eyes light up. If he couldn’t beat it, why couldn’t he hide? He stomped his foot on the ground and quickly dashed over. Since this old man made him suffer so much, he naturally wouldn’t see this old man hide alone.

But just when he was about to charge over, the tortoiseshell shrank in size and it only fits a single person now. Thus, Lin Yun collided with the tortoiseshell head-on, and he had blood dripping from his nose.

“Come in quickly, we’ll hide together.” Just when Lin Yun was about to hold onto his nose, the tortoiseshell opened up and Gu Jun waved his hand at him.

But just when he was about to head over, Gu Jun’s pupils were suddenly filled with horror, and he quickly placed the tortoiseshell down. This instantly made Lin Yun’s face turn dark because the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit had come over, and Gu Jun was unreliable at this critical moment.
