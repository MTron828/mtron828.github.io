Everyone was shocked as they watched the five fingers slice through the air and instantly envelop Lin Yun's region. This drew sighs from the surroundings because Lin Yun was still too young. If he had backed down just like Jin Xuanyi advised, this scene wouldn’t occur. After all, it was a dazzling achievement that Lin Yun defeated Huangfu Yan’s group of four.

Even if he couldn’t get into the top ten, no one would say a thing about him. They could already hear Lin Yun’s bones shattering under that golden palm, indicating his defeat.

But this scene surprised Ji Shuxuan, who was guarding the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. He could sense that something wasn’t right. When he looked closer, he saw that the golden palm didn’t suppress Lin Yun’s sword aura. On the contrary, his sword aura was compressing to avoid suppression.

Did Lin Yun already expect this situation? This speculation shocked Ji Shuxuan because if that was the case, how strong was Lin Yun’s attainment in Sword Dao? He soon dismissed it as a coincidence because even if Lin Yun was avoiding it on purpose, Ji Shuxuan didn’t think Lin Yun could withstand Jin Xuanyi’s attack.

But just when Ji Shuxuan felt uncertain, a weak flash shone from the region that the golden palm had enveloped. As the sword vibration hummed, it sounded like a piece of celestial music under the terrifying golden storm. Twelve dazzling sword rays circulated in the next second, and fine cracks appeared on the golden palm.

A gigantic Netherflower appeared above Lin Yun, releasing dazzling sword rays as it revolved. As Lin Yun stood beneath the Netherflower, his clothes fluttered, but was unharmed by Jin Xuanyi’s attack.

“What’s going on?” Jin Xuanyi’s face sank with surprise because his palm was being pushed back.

“The Nether Sword Seed!” Ji Shuxuan’s gaze fell onto the stamen of the Netherflower. The stamen of the Netherflower was emitting a black radiance, as if it was a world containing a boundless ocean of sword intent.

Jin Xuanyi’s facial expression also became grave as he looked at the stamen of the Netherflower, wondering what Lin Yun was nurturing in his Nether Sword Seed. It was already terrifying, even when it was a cocoon. So, just how powerful would it be when Lin Yun reaches the next few stages of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra? But before he had the time to figure it out, the golden palm was swiftly being eroded.

“He blocked it!”

“Holy shit, how did he manage to do that?” Everyone was shocked as they looked at Lin Yun. Jin Xuanyi’s attack distorted space, but Lin Yun held his ground against such a terrifying attack.

“Puny tricks.” Jin Xuanyi’s eyes flashed with a cold light. He had guessed what was nurturing the Nether Sword Seed.

“Golden Firmament Sword Sutra—Dancing Shadow!” Jin Xuanyi indifferently dissipated the golden palm before manifesting over a hundred sword rays, filling the entire sky before they swept towards Lin Yun like a storm. At the same time, he used his fingers like a sword as he approached Lin Yun.

“Great!” Lin Yun smiled. “Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilation!”

Circulating the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, all the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Auras in his violet palace were released from his pores and manifested into a heaven dragon and divine phoenix that revolved around Lin Yun. When they appeared, Lin Yun’s sword aura also began to skyrocket.

Even if Lin Yun didn’t use the cauldron, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon had reached a terrifying height after reaching the fourth stage. When the dragon and phoenix overlapped, Lin Yun used his finger to face Jin Xuanyi’s attack head-on.

The two were using their fingers like swords while they radiated brightly with sword rays. Their momentum didn’t look like something that could be grasped at the Elysium Core Realm.

As sword rays from both sides collided in mid-air, the sword auras being emitted from their fingers caused great waves to incessantly rage on the lake. They didn’t use their swords because they had their own pride. Jin Xuanyi wasn’t willing to be the first to draw his sword, thinking he was extraordinary and superior while having higher cultivation than Lin Yun. So he never thought of drawing his sword and wanted to suppress Lin Yun to teach him a lesson, letting him know that young people shouldn’t be too arrogant.

Lin Yun naturally saw through his intention, which sparked his fighting spirit. As the two fought, they created all sorts of phenomena, shattering and forming simultaneously.

“It’s no wonder why he’s so arrogant. He has another sword sutra!” Jin Xuanyi could naturally tell that the sword sutra Lin Yun was using right now was at an even higher grade than the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

As a hint of annoyance flashed through Jin Xuanyi’s pupils, he suddenly raised his strength to 80% and waved his hand over, unleashing a dazzling beam from his sleeves that rampaged through Lin Yun’s Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura. When he saw that he managed to force Lin Yun to retreat, he stood with his hands behind him and snorted.

But just when he was about to fly into the air, the sun and moon appeared on both sides above Lin Yun, with dragons coiling around him. When Lin Yun clasped his hands together, the sun and moon combined to form a huge cauldron that was engraved with dragons. This was the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist.

“What a futile attempt!” Jin Xuanyi’s eyes flashed with disdain. He didn’t think Lin Yun could turn the tables around. He naturally noticed that Lin Yun was using a holy spirit martial technique. It might work on others since he had reached the manifestation stage, but it was nothing to him.

He appeared directly above the cauldron and opened his palm before slowly clenching it. As he clenched his palm, a golden light surged over from the surroundings, and the light coming from his palm was soon comparable to the sun. He was accumulating his power, wanting to destroy the cauldron and let Lin Yun suffer the backlash of his martial technique. It was interesting just to think about it.

Lin Yun raised his brow when he saw this scene. But it wasn’t over yet. The Twelve-Petaled Netherflower flew into the cauldron, dying the entire cauldron black. When Jin Xuanyi’s palm landed on the cauldron, the collision created a loud explosion that caught many people in the surroundings by surprise and they began to bleed from their seven orifices.

Shortly after, a black shockwave swept over from their collision, reaching a thousand meters away and causing an explosion on the lake. When the water curtain fell back down, everyone could see a figure was sent flying away.

It was Jin Xuanyi who was sent flying away. He wanted to shatter the cauldron with a punch, but he failed and suffered a loss because of it. His face was ugly when he landed on the lake because this was the first time he had suffered such a significant loss after fighting for so long.

Suddenly, golden light covered the sky before a golden lotus appeared from the lake; the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower had finally appeared. Seeing the Azure Lotus Sword Flower instantly made Ji Shuxuan rejoice, but he was soon placed in a difficult position because he had no idea what to do. After all, Jin Xuanyi should’ve finished the battle by now.

But the battle was still ongoing even after the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower appeared. Even so, he didn’t make a move. His gaze was on Jin Xuanyi. Since the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower had appeared, it would be a waste if they just allowed the celestial aura to dissipate.

“Take it first.” Jin Xuanyi softly said as he looked at Ji Shuxuan. “Don’t worry about me. I’ll finish up quickly.”

“Alright.” Ji Shuxuan nodded and flew towards the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. But the golden aura around it had formed into layers of sword arrays, making it troublesome even for Ji Shuxuan to get close.

Lin Yun was furious when he heard that because he was clearly being disregarded by the two of them. He quickly ignored Jin Xuanyi and charged towards the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. But just when he took a few steps, Jin Xuanyi suddenly appeared before him.

Before Lin Yun could react, golden light exploded from Jin Xuanyi. He was no longer reserving his strength and unleashed his cultivation at the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. When he threw his punch forth, his punch broke all of Lin Yun’s dragon runes, causing Lin Yun to throw out a mouthful of blood with his face becoming pale.

“I said that it’s over!” Jin Xuanyi stood in the air with his hands behind him. He coldly continued, “Young people shouldn’t be too arrogant. Don’t think you’re invincible just because you have a body-refining technique. It doesn’t work on me!”

Everything happened too quickly, and the audience members were shocked. They finally realized that Jin Xuanyi had never used his full strength in his fight with Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun didn’t say a word, he just threw his punch. This scene made Jin Xuanyi wear a disdainful smile. But just before his punch was about to land on Jin Xuanyi’s chest, the ocean of astral energy in Lin Yun’s violet palace suddenly sank and a black demonic cauldron slowly appeared.

Taking Lin Yun’s punch, Jin Xuanyi threw out a mouthful of blood. That punch had sent a black beam flying out from his back, appearing to have pierced his chest.

As Jin Xuanyi threw another mouthful of blood, he fell to one knee a hundred meters away. The pain was so intense that it made his face distort, and he even had a tough time grasping his breath because of the pain.

“Young people are young because they’re arrogant.” Lin Yun said. His face was pale, and he still had sweat rolling down his forehead, but his gaze was ferocious.
