Chapter 2009 - Trust Between People

The Blood Crow Ancestor’s accumulated attack was like an erupting volcano, unleashing his attack when Lin Yun turned around.

But Lin Yun was already warned of the Blood Crow Ancestor’s attack with the Azure Dragon Sword Heart. He never expected that the Blood Crow Ancestor would be so fast. In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun raised the Sovereign Saint Artifact in his hand without thinking.

The clash produced a loud explosion with an azure saint radiance enveloping their entire region with fine cracks appearing within the surrounding space, accompanied by a powerful shockwave that rippled out.

The umbrella in Lin Yun’s hand pierced through the Blood Crow Ancestor’s palm, causing the Blood Crow Ancestor to scream before he was sent flying away. As for Lin Yun, he took three steps back, but he didn’t feel good.

“How dare you fool me!” The Blood Crow Ancestor roared, grabbing onto his wrist.

“Likewise, you’re not bad yourself.” Lin Yun held onto the umbrella and looked at the Blood Crow Ancestor. The Blood Crow Ancestor had already refined saint aura, so he wouldn’t have any advantage, even with his Astral Sword Intent and Glory Saint Artifact. It would’ve been dangerous if he fought with the Blood Crow Ancestor.

He could land a hundred strikes, which might not kill the Blood Crow Ancestor. But the Blood Crow Ancestor only needed one attack to inflict heavy injuries on him. Lin Yun had already experienced the power of saint aura, and it wasn’t something his nirvana aura could confront. He could only rely on the Sovereign Saint Artifact and see if he could find an opportunity.

But the effect wasn’t as great as he had imagined. He only managed to pierce through the Blood Crow Ancestor’s palm, and this was because he didn’t have much time. The Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella had three seals, and he was so hurried that he didn’t even undo the first seal. The true power of the Sovereign Saint Physique had yet to be fully released.

“Your umbrella is powerful enough to pierce through my saint aura!” The Blood Crow Ancestor looked at the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella with a dark face.

“This is a Sovereign Saint Artifact. Let’s not mention saint aura; it can even pierce through your head,” Lin Yun said.

“Hahaha…” The Blood Crow Ancestor laughed and said in disdain, “Do you think I’m the same as the garbage outside? Let’s not mention a brat like you can’t possess a Sovereign Saint Artifact. Even if it’s a genuine Sovereign Saint Artifact, how much power can you exert?”

“Why don’t you come and give it a try, then?” Lin Yun provoked.

This instantly made the Blood Crow Ancestor suspicious, and they faced off just like that. A brief moment later, the Blood Crow Ancestor smiled, “Boy, don’t you want to know the clues of the Udumbara Flower?”

“Old dog, aren’t you interested in the Natal Yin Saint Physique?” Lin Yun sneered.

“It looks like we both lack trust. How about this, we’ll each take three steps back and pretend that nothing had happened. I’ll wait for you to bring the Natal Yin Saint Physique over before telling you the clues of the Udumbara Flower,” the Blood Crow Ancestor awkwardly smiled.

“Fine with me,” Lin Yun replied.

“Good. I’ll take one step back first to show my sincerity,” the Blood Crow Ancestor smiled and stepped back, retreating ten-odd meters back. It didn’t take long for Lin Yun and the Blood Crow Ancestor to take three steps back, but neither one turned around.

“Time for you to show your sincerity. You can turn around, and I’ll turn around,” the Blood Crow Ancestor said.

“Ha!” Lin Yun sneered.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Can’t we have some trust between people?” The Blood Crow Ancestor asked.

“You’re not a person,” Lin Yun replied.

The Blood Crow Ancestor grinned, “You’re not a good person, either.”

“That’s because all the good people have gone into your stomach,” Lin Yun said mockingly, pointing at the bones on the ground.

The Blood Crow Ancestor wasn’t furious when he heard that, and said, “Alright. We’ll both count to three and turn around together.”

“Okay…” Lin Yun agreed, and he softly muttered something.

“As a swordsman, you can’t lie.”

“That’s for sure.”

The Blood Crow Ancestor was satisfied upon hearing that. After counting to three, he began to turn around but stopped halfway, wanting to turn back. He spread his arms apart and laughed, “Hahaha! Boy, you fell for it!”

But when he turned around, a dragon roar echoed as Lin Yun undid the first seal on the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, thrusting the umbrella at the Blood Crow Ancestor’s heart. The umbrella easily tore apart the saint aura around the Blood Crow Ancestor, causing cracks on his bones' surface.

As the Blood Crow Ancestor threw out a mouthful of blood, he roared, “You lied! You didn’t turn around!”

“I didn’t lie. I said, ‘Okay my ass.’” Lin Yun dashed out as the Golden Crow Wings appeared behind him, unleashing another attack with the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, landing on the Blood Crow Ancestor’s back.

After being struck by the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella six times, the Blood Crow Ancestor finally stopped retreating and began to retaliate.

But Lin Yun pushed his Divine Sunchasing Art to the limit, leaving behind afterimages in the air. Ten moves later, the Blood Crow Ancestor took an attack from the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella head-on, and released an attack at Lin Yun’s heart.

Lin Yun was already prepared for it. He poured the two types of dragon runes into the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and undone the second seal. As an Azure Dragon let out a roar, the aura of a Sovereign Saint Artifact swept out, and the Blood Crow Ancestor was dumbfounded. Before the Blood Crow Ancestor could retreat, Lin Yun thrust the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, blowing apart the Blood Crow Ancestor’s arm.

The Blood Crow Ancestor was sent flying away, throwing out a mouthful of blood as it roared, “It’s really a Sovereign Saint Artifact! No wonder I noticed that there’s something unusual about you!”

“I never lie.” Lin Yun ignored the Blood Crow Ancestor and raised the umbrella, pouring more dragon runes into the umbrella. As a terrifying aura swept out, the third seal was undone. A cold light flashed through Lin Yun’s pupils because he intended to inflict heavy injuries on the Blood Crow Ancestor with this strike.

When the umbrella was opened, Lin Yun’s face changed because it felt like a black fog, and he couldn’t sense the existence of the Azure Dragon Constellation. He exclaimed, “What’s going on?!”

“I’ll spare you for now. I’ll return tomorrow!” Lin Yun’s voice echoed.

The Blood Crow Ancestor gritted his teeth and roared, “Damn it! You shameless brat! If you dare to come tomorrow, I’ll make sure you don’t go back!”

The Blood Crow Ancestor furiously returned to the grave to treat his injuries. He couldn’t remember when was the last time he suffered so badly.

When Lin Yun kept the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, he breathed a sigh of relief. He killed five Blood Crow Kings, obtained over a hundred beads and a golden bead that seemed extremely precious on this trip.

But Lin Yun didn’t feel complacent because of it. The Blood Crow Kings were strong but couldn’t use their entire strength. So there was nothing to be proud of about killing them. The Blood Crow Ancestor was the problem, but he wasn’t in a hurry and could slowly grind him down.

He would force the clues about the Udumbara Flower out from the Blood Crow Ancestor sooner or later. As for why the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella couldn’t summon the Azure Dragon Constellation, Lin Yun felt it was related to the God Burial Mountain Range.

There was a seal around the God Burial Mountain Range, and he still couldn’t bypass it with his current strength.

When he returned to the spiritual array set up by Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun consumed a Profound Wither Pellet to treat his injuries. He actually didn’t suffer any serious injuries. This was because he was on guard and didn’t allow any saint aura to enter his body. So it didn’t take long for him to recover from his injuries.

“With so many beads, it should be enough for me to reach the pinnacle seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage.” Lin Yun now possessed three hundred thousand strands of nirvana aura, but it was still lacking when compared to the top ten on the King Ranking. After all, they were all at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and were all elites amongst the elites.

But Lin Yun wasn’t afraid since his foundation wasn’t weaker than any of them. He had two sword sutras, and could even use the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron in a critical moment. So as long as he had enough nirvana aura, he could face them, even if he was at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

“Let’s increase the nirvana aura to four hundred thousand strands and try to reach three thousand feet in my sword sea…” Lin Yun closed his eyes and began to absorb the beads. The beads were much better to absorb than the sins from Blood Crow’s corpses. It wasn’t painful, and the tempering effects were ten times better.

Lin Yun guessed that it must be because the Blood Crow Kings had refined them before, and there weren’t any impurities in the beads. It didn’t take long for a Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix to coil around him. He also gave off a crimson aura, with the surrounding air trembling like countless saint swords around him.
