Chapter 1237 - Sword Box!

When Lin Yun left, the smile on Jian Jingtian’s smile disappeared. His temperament was a carbon copy of Ye Ziling as if they were cut from the same cloth.

A long time later, when Jian Jingtian suddenly thought of something, the smile on his lips turned warm. He finally knew why Lin Yun wanted to provoke him and used the word “swordsman”. Lin Yun was probably trying to make amends through his own method.

No matter what, Jian Jingtian had saved Lin Yun’s life in the past, so Lin Yun shouldn’t have said those words back then. But with Lin Yun’s personality, there was no way he would bow his head to someone like Jian Jingtian. It made sense since Lin Yun feigned ignorance when he was asked if he knew the meaning behind the Sword Assembly.

The two of them were stubborn, and it was simply impossible for one party to bow to the other. Swordsmen had pride that was deeply etched into their hearts, so they could never lower their heads. So Lin Yun could only use his own method to spark Jian Jingtian’s fighting spirit.

“That brat…” Jian Jingtian smiled. Now that he looked at it again, it had been many years since he had displayed his grace before others. In fact, the last time he unleashed his sword intent was 18 years ago.

Thinking about it, Jian Jingtian’s face froze and the smile disappeared. He then shut his eyes painfully with tears rolling down his cheeks. At this moment, he was riddled with unprecedented pain, regret, and misery.

Master, I’m really sorry…

Suddenly, he could hear his own voice from the past, “I swear that one day, I’ll make the Sword Sect a holy land again! One day, I swear that I’ll make the Sword Sect the strongest sect in the world!”

Without knowing, two streams of tears rolled down his cheeks.

Outside the main hall, Lin Yun held onto the Lightning Shadow Sword and covered his eyes. He only opened them after a lot of time had passed. His eyes were still a bloody mess and full of pain. He was completely crushed by Jian Jingtian, without being able to put up any resistance.

“Well, there’s a reason why he was first on the three rankings!” Lin Yun sighed.

“Hmph. This empress already told you that someone like him is rare even in ancient times. If it wasn’t for the cage that he locked himself in, he would already be a king by now!” Lil’ Purple flew out of the sword box and retrieved a napkin to help Lin Yun wipe his tears.

“It feels great. What did you dip the napkin in? It’s weird because it doesn’t hurt at all!” As Lin Yun blinked his eyes, his gaze became clearer. He had no more pain and his eyesight became even brighter.

“Hmph, it’s this empress’ saliva, of course!” Lil’ Purple said.

Hearing that, Lin Yun’s smile instantly froze on his face, “That’s disgusting.”

“You really are a scumbag. Do you have any idea how many people would die for this in the past? You really need a beating!” Lil’ Purple said unhappily. It might sound weird, but dragon saliva was considered a treasure, so it was naturally the same for phoenix saliva.

Thinking about it in this manner, Lin Yun felt better. But a brief moment later, he couldn’t help locking his brows together, “It’s still disgusting.”

“Y-You scumbag! Hmph, this empress is angry now!” Lil’ Purple said as her face turned black.

“I won’t mind if it was from a genuine phoenix, but it’s a pity that you’re not in your phoenix form. It can barely be considered phoenix saliva,” explained Lin Yun.

“Hmph, you scumbag. You want my phoenix saliva? I’ll burn you to death with a breath when I regain my real body. Since you don’t want it, give it back to me!” Lil’ Purple roared.

“Hahaha, alright. I’ll give it back to you. I have the Azure Dragon Saint Physique now. Although it’s incomparable to an azure dragon, I bet it still has at least a trace of dragon saliva. So how much of my saliva do you want?” Lin Yun smiled with his eyes squinted.

Lil’ Purple was dazed when she heard that because it did make some sense. But if that was the case, wouldn’t that be an indirect kiss? Her face instantly burned red as she lowered her voice, “You scumbag. You’re really disgusting!”

Lil’ Purple instantly ran off when she was done. When Lin Yun looked at her running off, he laughed and chased after her. “Empress, don’t run!”

“You get lost!” cried Lil’ Purple.

“Hahaha, no way. Don’t you want me to give you dragon saliva?” asked Lin Yun.

“I don’t want it!” yelled Lil’ Purple.

The two played around briefly and Lin Yun only stopped when he returned to his residence, “Lil’ Purple, did you realize that Jian Jingtian stopped whenever he mentioned his master?”

It happened many times in the past, including today.

“What’s so weird about it?” Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes.

Lying on the grassy patch, Lin Yun looked at the sky and said, “I’m curious who his master is since he was given the Lightning Shadow Sword.”

“Hmph, that has nothing to do with you, either way,” said Lil’ Purple.

“Well, that’s true.” Lin Yun was briefly distracted before he smiled, “Empress, how strong do you think his sword intent is? Is it at least in the fifth-grade sword intent?”

Jian Jingtian’s sword intent was so powerful that it made him feel as if it was a bottomless abyss. Lin Yun’s sword intent had already reached quasi-fourth grade, so if Jian Jingtian was only in the fourth grade, it shouldn’t have such intense pressure.

“That’s hard to say. Once sword intent reaches a certain height, it can emit a terrifying pressure, such as your Azure Dragon Sword Aura, which can boost your sword intent. If your sword intent was fused into the Azure Dragon Sword Aura, not many people can reach a tenth of your strength,” said Lil’ purple. “Take lightning, flame, or thunderstorm intent for example. They can also be fused into sword intent to make them a lot stronger. That old geezer has reached the fifth grade, and he has other means to empower his sword intent. I can’t see through him, but I know that it’s very strong.”

Lin Yun squinted his eyes before smiling because Lil’ Purple’s last sentence was extremely important. The old geezer’s sword intent was many times stronger than his own. But he actually didn’t discover that there was such a treasure hidden in the sect for half a year. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The old geezer was naturally too lazy to teach others, but there was a high chance he would help Lin Yun if the latter swallowed his pride and asked for help. Regardless, there was something unusual happening with the Profound Wither Sea, and Lin Yun needed to prepare himself by going into seclusion.

“That old geezer definitely has stories. Just what happened eighteen years ago?” Lin Yun muttered. He was now curious about the old geezer.

“Don’t do something as stupid as what you did today. The knot in his heart is bigger than you think, and your effort would be futile,” said Lil’ Purple.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned and didn’t think that his thoughts were seen through by Lil’ Purple. A brief moment later, he spat out the grass in his mouth and removed the sword box from his back. When he looked at the sword box, his face gradually became grave.

“What are you trying to do?” Lil’ purple asked.

“It’s time for me to take a look inside. I’m really curious about the world in the sword box,” said Lin Yun while patting at the sword box.

“Have you thought it through?” asked Lil’ Purple.

“I already have,” said Lin Yun calmly. He knew that if he entered, he would be tied with the Iris Sword Saint and could be considered the latter’s heir.

“You once told me that the Iris Sword Saint that I saw in the past was only a clone? Does that mean that the real Iris Sword Saint isn’t dead?” Lin Yun asked. This was the question that he had been wanting to ask for a long time.

“That brat grasped the Nirvana Dao, so he won’t die that easily,” said Lil’ Purple.

“Nirvana Dao?” Lin Yun was surprised because he had never heard of this dao before.

“It’s useless for me to tell you about it now. But since you’ve already made up your mind, I won’t stop you. You just have to use the Iris Sacred Flame to refine the mark in this sword box and you’ll be able to enter as you wish. At the same time, you will be imprinted as the Iris Sword Saint’s heir,” said Lil’ Purple seriously.

The Iris Sacred Flame appeared on Lin Yun’s palm and controlled it with his will. Then, he flicked the flame at the sword box and the stains on the sword box melted away. The runes on the surface of the sword box began to light up along with the appearance of an ancient and complicated iris flower. Suddenly, runes spread out on both sides of the flower like a pair of wings.

“Drip your blood on it!” Lil’ Purple suddenly said a moment later.

Lin Yun knew that there was no turning back the moment his blood touched the sword box. Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun cut the tip of his finger and squeezed out a drop of blood. When the drop of blood fell onto the sword box, the entire sword box began to shake, as if it were alive.
