Chapter 1425 - Dare To Represent The Sword Sect?

The Scarlet Firmament Peak was the last quota, and that quota weighed differently since it was the peak that all sect masters came from. But that quota wasn’t given to Lin Yun or Xiahou Yan. There was no question that Ye Ziyun was strong, but it was clear that Lin Yun and Xiahou Yan were both stronger than her from their performance at the Barren Sword Mound. This made everyone feel unbelievable.

But instead of picking Lin Yun or Xiahou Yan, the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord picked Ye Ziyun. This stumped everyone and made them wonder if they had misheard him. If not, then this meant that Lin Yun and Xiahou Yan wouldn’t be able to become the disciple of a saint, as well as Huang Yancheng and Chen Bing, who originated from Ancient Saint Clans; this surprised everyone.

“Why me?” Ye Ziyun asked. She was prepared to be eliminated, but the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord surprised her. She quickly calmed down and wanted to know why the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord chose her.

“There’s a fate between you and the Scarlet Firmament Peak.” The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord smiled. “You don’t have to ask too much. You just have to answer if you’re willing to be my disciple. In the future, you’ll have to stay in the Sword Sect to cultivate, and you won’t be able to return to the Radiant Snow Clan any time soon.”

“This disciple is willing!” Ye Ziyun cupped her hands. She was here to become the disciple of a saint, so she was naturally willing, she would just have to figure out the reason why she was chosen in the future.

“Seniors, may you allow me to interrupt.” Xiahou Yan finally couldn’t hold back and interrupted with a dark face.

The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord frowned upon hearing Xiahou Yan’s interruption and unhappily said, “Speak.”

“How am I inferior to them?” Xiahou Yan asked as he suppressed his anger. His heart was filled with boundless rage, and he had nowhere to vent it. What happened today was simply a huge humiliation to him, and there was no way he could accept it if the Sword Sect didn’t give him an explanation.

The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord briefly pondered before he replied, “No one can rival your talent in the sword path with your innate Sword Physique and Innate Sword Heart. It’s just that you have no fate with us.”

Bullshit! Xiahou Yan snickered, “I knew everyone from the Sword Sect was blind. So it turns out that you guys have no eyes to see!”

His words made the six saints furrow their brows. Jue Chen barked, “Xiahou Yan, mind your words!”

“I’m not convinced!” Xiahou Yan’s face was gloomy and cold. He couldn’t be bothered with Jue Chen as he pointed to Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan. “Saints can accept these two pieces of trash, so why can’t they accept me? Give me an explanation, or your Sword Sect is humiliating me, Xiahou Yan, today!”

“Who do you think you are to demand an explanation from saints?” Jue Chen coldly replied.

“Since the Sword Sect isn’t going to give me any face, don’t blame me for not giving the Sword Sect face, then!” Xiahou Yan coldly smiled. “So the saints have accepted several talented disciples? Then I wonder which of them dares to fight me!”

He released his firmament sword intent when he spoke and his hair began to flutter in the wind. He hovered in the air as he coldly looked down at them, making the faces of Jiang Cheng, Zhao Yan, Ye Ziyun, Ye Ziling, and Ye Qing change. They knew that they would lose terribly if they fought Xiahou Yan right now.

“A bunch of trash who don’t even dare to fight me? It doesn’t matter. You guys can join hands if you want!” Xiahou Yan finally exploded with all the rage that had accumulated within his heart. As a leading figure amongst the younger generation of swordsmen in the Ancient Barren Domain, he was already giving the Sword Sect respect by coming over.

He came for the Radiant Sword Saint. Not only did the Radiant Sword Saint refuse to take him in as a disciple, the other saints didn’t even want to take him in as their disciple. In his opinion, these people should kneel and beg him to join the Sword Sect.

But it was a pity that only Xiahou Yan thought that it would be the saint’s honor for him to become their disciple. He was a conceited man, just like how he had no intention of apologizing when his brother was the one who was unreasonable and tried to trick Lin Yun into a bet. He even wanted Lin Yun to return the Bodhi Seed.

As for why? It’s only because he was Xiahou Yan. He believed he had already given Lin Yun some face by talking to him. This was also why he wasn’t interested in the any saint except the Radiant Sword Saint. But the result was a resounding slap to his face since none of the six saints had an eye on him, so how could he bear that?

Jue Chen’s face was gloomy because Xiahou Yan was really pushing it. But just when he was about to speak, the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord looked at Xiahou Yan. “You can’t just look at the present. None of our disciples can compare to you in terms of talent, but talent is just a gauge to see how far one has come. What determines how far a person can go is their character.”

The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord was blatantly saying that Xiahou Yan had a poor character and had nothing to do with the Sword Sect. The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord still gave Xiahou Yan some face.

When Lin Yun saw this scene, a smile rose on the corner of his lips and his favorable impression of the Sword Sect increased. If a saint took in Xiahou Yan, it would be hard for him to have any sense of belonging to the Sword Sect.

Xiahou Yan’s face turned pale with malice surging in his pupils when he heard what the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord said. The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord publicly questioned his character, which made Xiahou Yan’s face distort as he coldly said, “How interesting! The Sword Sect is really aloof. Do you guys still believe that you are the strongest Sword Sect in the Eastern Desolation? You people dare question my character? It is no wonder why the Sword Sect has been declining.”

“Xiahou Yan, if you continue to be rude, don’t blame me for not giving you any face!” Jue Chen’s face was ugly because Xiahou Yan was really stubborn. According to what Xiahou Yan said, everything had to go according to his wishes. It was fortunate that the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t take Xiahou Yan in back then, or his reputation would have been ruined.

“Am I wrong?” Xiahou Yan coldly said. “None of the saints’ disciples dares to fight me and need an elder to bully me? Hahaha! What a joke! I, Xiahou Yan, stand here today to ask which of the saints’ disciples dares to fight me! Three thousand years ago, the Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng broke two peaks with one sword. Today, I will sweep through all your saints’ disciples. If you guys aren’t happy, you can come at me together!”

His words made the faces of everyone from the Sword Sect, including the saints, ugly. They were utterly disgusted by Xiahou Yan. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

What happened 3,000 years ago was the shame of the Sword Sect, a scar that couldn’t be healed. And Xiahou Yan’s words were no different from humiliating the Sword Sect. What was more disgusting was that Xiahou Yan wanted to let the saints’ disciples join hands to face him.

If the saints’ disciples joined hands, it wouldn’t matter if they won or lost because Xiahou Yan was already undefeated. If he won, his fame would spread even further. If he lost, then it was the Sword Sect who was unreasonable to let the saints’ disciples join hands to bully him.

“What Brother Xiahou said is right!” Huang Yancheng smiled as he stood out. “I, Huang Yancheng, am also unconvinced. How can these pieces of trash become the saints’ disciples? This is a world where strong people possess a strong authority of speech. Show us that they’re worthy of becoming the saints’ disciples with their strength, or the Sword Sect is nothing but a joke.”

“That’s right. I demand an explanation from the Sword Sect today!” Chen Bing also stood out.

They were both unhappy that they weren’t chosen as the saints’ disciples. They initially didn’t have the guts to stand out. But they stood out when they saw that there was nothing the Sword Sect could do after Xiahou Yan humiliated them.

The faces of Jiang Cheng, Ye Ziyun, and the others were ugly and wanted to fight. But just when they were about to make a move, they were stopped by their masters because none of them were Xiahou Yan’s opponents. If they stood out, they would only be humiliated and make Xiahou Yan even more arrogant.

“What’s wrong? No one dares to fight me?” Xiahou Yan’s eyes flashed with mockery. “Looks like the Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng didn’t just slice off two peaks from the Sword Sect, he even broke all of your backbones. You guys are nothing but a bunch of cowards now!”

“Xiahou Yan, don’t push it!” Jue Chen gritted his teeth.

“Haha. So what if I push it? What can you do to me?” Xiahou Yan laughed. “Since the Sword Sect isn’t giving me any face, don’t blame me for not giving the Sword Sect any face in return. It doesn’t matter if you guys dare to challenge me because I will become famous after today. Three thousand years later, I might be comparable to the Sword Emperor. At that time, the Sword Sect will be nothing but a joke!”

Since he had taken it this far, he was determined to humiliate the Sword Sect to the end. They said that he had a poor character. Then he would slap the Sword Sect’s face and thoroughly humiliate them. He had nothing to fear because he knew that neither the elder nor the saints could make a move against him. Since that was the case, what did he have to be afraid of?

Xiahou Yan was too arrogant, making everyone from the Sword Sect, including those who had just joined, furiously grit their teeth as they looked at him. But no one stepped forth because it would be embarrassing if Xiahou Yan defeated them. Thus, the surroundings fell into a dead silence as Xiahou Yan looked down on everyone.

“You dare compare yourself with Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng? I didn’t know that you’re that shameless…” A familiar cold voice resounded. When everyone turned their heads around, their gazes fell onto Lin Yun because no one thought that he, who also wasn’t taken in as a disciple, would stand out at this moment.

“I’m up for it, if you want a fight.” Lin Yun calmly said as he stepped forth.

“Who do you think you are? Only the saints’ disciples are qualified to fight me!” Xiahou Yan snickered. If it was before, Xiahou Yan wouldn’t mind fighting Lin Yun and teaching him a lesson. But he had no interest in him because he wanted to embarrass the Sword Sect. As for the grudge regarding the Bodhi Seed, he would deal with him again in the future.

“Indeed, he’s suitable to fight you.” The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord said before Lin Yun could speak. He coldly continued, “But it’s not because he’s not qualified, it’s because you’re the one who’s not qualified!”

Xiahou Yan’s face changed when he heard that, and he coldly asked, “What do you mean?”

“When the Heavenly Path ended, Martial Uncle Radiant already decided to take him in as a disciple. But Martial Uncle is in seclusion right now, so it’s not convenient for him to come out. Otherwise, do you think the six of us would be blind to miss out on someone like Lin Yun? Xiahou Yan, do you understand now? You’re the one who’s not worthy of becoming his opponent!”

A rumble of thunder echoed within Xiahou Yan’s mind with his lips trembling. He recovered from his shock after some time had passed and muttered, “H-H-How is this possible?! How can the Radiant Sword Saint take him in as a true disciple? I don’t believe it! That’s not true!”

This was simply too embarrassing. He mocked Lin Yun for not being a saint’s disciple and wasn’t qualified to fight him. But it turned out that not only was Lin Yun a saint’s disciple, he was even the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple!

This was even greater than becoming the disciple of the six saints. Everyone in the Ancient Barren Domain knew that Xiahou Yan wanted to become the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint. But he couldn’t even see the Radiant Sword Saint himself, not to mention that the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord said that he was the one who wasn’t qualified.

“I’m unconvinced! The Sword Sect is blind, and the old geezer Radiant Sword Saint is also blind! I’m not convinced! Fight me if you dare, and I’ll make sure to cripple you!” Xiahou Yan’s face was distorted, and he had lost control of his emotions at that moment.

As the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord let out a snort, he turned to Lin Yun. “Where’s Lin Yun?”

“Here!” Lin Yun solemnly cupped his hands together.

The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord continued, “The Sword Sect and Radiant Sword Saint are being humiliated. Someone is looking down on my Sword Sect. He’s at the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, possessing the Innate Sword Physique, Innate Sword Heart, and Firmament Sword Intent. Lin Yun, do you dare to represent my Sword Sect and fight him?”
