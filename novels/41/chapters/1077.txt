Chapter 1078 - Pinnacle Fight

Lin Yun’s appearance caused a huge commotion on the Saint Spiritual Lake. Even the remaining Realm Sons were shocked. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun was actually still alive after taking the combined attacks of their holy spirits. On top of that, Lin Yun survived the process of the Imperial Feather Realm Son digging out his Azure Dragon True Bone.

When Yue Weiwei, who was trapped by the Heavenly Path Mirror, saw this scene, she rejoiced, “Big Brother Yun, you have to stay alive!”

Luo Chen’s group felt conflicted when they saw Lin Yun. They were happy that Lin Yun wasn’t dead, but they were worried about him fighting the Imperial Feather Realm Son.

Even if Lin Yun still had his Azure Dragon True Bone, they didn’t think that he could defeat the Imperial Feather Realm Son. It wasn’t because they were pessimistic, but the strength that the Imperial Feather Realm Son just revealed was unfathomable.

“Haha, so what if you’re still alive? The fact that you came out on your own means you’ll die!” The Imperial Feather Realm Son sneered. He was 70% confident that he could defeat Lin Yun in his top condition, let alone Lin Yun’s current condition. After all, he wanted to reveal his true strength and take the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit from everyone else.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son looked at Lin Yun with disdain. In his eyes, Lin Yun foolishly revealed all of his trump cards for a woman. There was no way he would be surprised by anything a haggard Lin Yun attempted.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son stood on the surface of the lake with his hands behind his back, “Lin Yun, isn’t it just an Azure Dragon True Bone? You can bear with it until you get to Kunlun Realm. With your talent, you’ll definitely rise in Kunlun Realm. Taking a stand right now is no different from death.”

“Just an Azure Dragon True Bone? No one has ever taken something from me. I don’t care what you say, I’m going to get revenge today,” said Lin Yun with a killing aura flashing in his pupils. If the ice phoenix hadn’t helped him, he would be a dead person by now. So how could he sit idly by and wait?

The Imperial Feather Realm Son snorted, “Hmph, you think you can survive? Without the Azure Dragon True Bone, you’re just a piece of trash. Now, I’ll be taking your head!”

The moment he finished, flames blazed on the surface of his body. The Imperial Feather Realm Son unleashed his martial intent, which caused the entire lake to start boiling. He was unleashing his third-grade flame intent. Then, a Flame Phoenix flew out of his body. He was actually using his holy spirit. When the Imperial Feather Realm Son poured his vitality into his holy spirit, he looked like an emperor.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“What power!” Countless gazes fell onto the Imperial Feather Realm Son. Clearly, the Imperial Feather Realm Son wasn’t holding back.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son naturally knew that there was an irreconcilable feud between him and Lin Yun after he dug out Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone. So Lin Yun would kill him if he had the chance. Therefore, the Imperial Feather Realm Son couldn’t leave such a dangerous threat around.

When the pressure of the flame intent and holy spirit descended onto Lin Yun, he emitted a dazzling sword intent and ferocious dragon roar. Golden radiance shined out of Lin Yun’s body as he activated the Golden Crow. Then, he summoned his Silver Phoenix, which dyed the sky in gold and silver.

“Dual holy spirits!” Lin Yun had displayed unrivaled power back in Wind Mound City with his two holy spirits. So when everyone saw that he brought out both holy spirits, they knew he was serious.

“Die!” The Imperial Feather Realm Son sneered as he arrived in front of Lin Yun. In the next second, boundless spiritual energy surged on the Flame Phoenix. When the Imperial Feather Realm Son threw out his punch, the phoenix released a cry and charged forward. Along with his punch, the phoenix unleashed countless meteorites.

When Lin Yun raised his head, the meteorites looked like gigantic mountains that were on fire. But all Lin Yun did was reach out with his right hand. Thunderstorm energy started to gather on his fist while 18 purple-golden runes bloomed on the surface of his body. Then, Lin Yun added his sword intent into the attack.

“This is…?” Everyone was shocked to see a terrifying thunderstorm vortex gathering in Lin Yun’s hand. When the vortex spun, Lin Yun combined his sky sword intent and Azure Dragon Grab together. He could now manipulate this attack freely.

“What arrogance!” The Imperial Feather Realm Son sneered. He knew what Lin Yun was trying to do because he witnessed the Azure Dragon Grab back in Wind Mound City. It's strong, but Lin Yun is naive if he thinks he can cancel out my Heavenly Meteorite Fist.

There were over a hundred meteorites, and Lin Yun would be heavily injured if just one of them hit him. Furthermore, Lin Yun’s current physique was extremely weak without the Azure Dragon True Bone.

Suddenly, Lin Yun raised his hand and pulled all the meteorites into his vortex. Then, he threw them back at the Imperial Feather Realm Son. “Here, you can have them back!”

“How overbearing!” Luo Chen’s group was filled with joy upon seeing this scene. After all, the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s martial intent was in the third grade. But even so, Lin Yun could still counter the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s attack.

The hundred flaming meteorites instantly devoured the Imperial Feather Realm Son, causing a series of explosions in the process. The light produced by the explosion was so dazzling that they couldn’t look at it directly.

But in the next second, the Imperial Feather Realm Son charged out of the explosions as the Demonic Astral Flowers blazed his aura oceans. Shockingly, he had 12 Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans!

Flames were everywhere now that he was releasing his aura with Demonic Astral Flowers. The Flame Phoenix then flapped its wings and fought Lin Yun’s two holy spirits evenly. He was taking full advantage of his cultivation and Demonic Astral Flowers.

“Hmph, the gap between us is too great!” The Imperial Feather Realm Son roared. His clothes were tattered and he had clearly suffered considerable damage from Lin Yun’s counterattack.

Lin Yun didn’t panic. Instead, he unleashed all 15 Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans. When they combined, the Imperial Feather Realm Son was placed under immense pressure.

“He has 15!” Everyone was shocked when they saw the number of Demonic Astral Flowers that Lin Yun had. It was so surprising since Lin Yun was only in the fifth soul. Meanwhile, Lin Yun and the Imperial Feather Realm Son instantly exchanged dozens of moves. Simultaneously, the sea of flames radiated with power behind Lin Yun.

The intensity of the fight exceeded everyone’s expectations. No one thought that Lin Yun would be so strong despite losing the Azure Dragon True Bone. Even the Realm Sons were dumbfounded by the strength that Lin Yun was displaying.

The five Realm Sons felt a chill run down their spines because they weren’t sure what Lin Yun would do to them if he won. As the sea of flames exploded in the sky, both Lin Yun and the Imperial Feather Realm Son retreated.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son’s face was ugly because Lin Yun’s strength had exceeded his imagination. Furthermore, Lin Yun seemed to be even stronger after losing his Azure Dragon True Bone. He began to suspect that Lin Yun still had a few trump cards.

“Imperial Feather Realm Son, it’s your turn to take an attack from me!” Lin Yun roared as the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix shone in the sky.
