Chapter 2175: Young Men

Ye Guhan was still thinking about comforting Lin Yun, but he was the one needing comforting after hearing what Lin Yun said.

.

Lin Yun asked in surprise, “Is my progress fast?”

Ye Guhan bitterly smiled and didn’t want to pay any attention to Lin Yun anymore. But thinking about it again, Lin Yun was his Junior Brother.

“I've only reached the pinnacle of the third stage in six months. I still think that I let you down,” Lin Yun said.

Ye Guhan, who had decided to forgive Lin Yun, nearly threw up after hearing that. He said, “I knew that I shouldn’t have paid any attention to you, and now you are showing off again.”

“I’m not showing off,” Lin Yun quickly explained.

Ye Guhan said, “Let me tell you this. Not to mention the pinnacle of the third stage, it’s already impressive if you can manifest a sword within six months. I initially thought that it might be your best progress, and the worst would be not manifesting any sword. I was just going to tell you not to be too proud of yourself.”

Hearing what Ye Guhan said, Lin Yun smiled, “So my current progress is…?”

“At least ranked in the top three in the history of the Sword Sect. Only peerless geniuses from the Golden Era could be compared to you. Even our master wasn’t as fast as you, so you can be proud,” Ye Guhan rolled his eyes.

“I got it,” Lin Yun smiled. He finally felt relieved after hearing that.

“So you’re blaming yourself for your progress.” Seeing that Lin Yun was heaving a sigh of relief, Ye Guhan knew that Lin Yun wasn’t showing off on purpose.

“Alright, don’t dwell on that anymore. Your senior brother nearly threw out a mouthful of blood for you.” Ye Guhan smiled, before he reached out, “Go on, show me.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun’s expression became grave. He was feeling nervous with his senior brother beside him. He took a breath to calm himself down before circulating the Great Profound Sword Canon.

A black lotus bloomed within his violent palace as Lin Yun gradually hovered into the air, circulating the Great Profound Sword Canon and filling up his body with indigo saint aura. When the lotus bloomed, Lin Yun formed a seal with one hand, and he coldly said, “Divine Firmament!”

A black saint sword appeared behind him. It was the Divine Firmament Sword of the seven peaks, permeating nether energy, and the black sword radiance soon spread to over a few hundred feet. Lin Yun also had nether energy spreading out over him, and his sword aura became terrifying.

“Not bad. Change to the Indigo Firmament Sword,” Ye Guhan said. Receiving encouragement, Lin Yun changed his seals and lightning began to form in the sky. Lin Yun basked in the indigo lightning as the Indigo Firmament Sword appeared beside the Divine Firmament Sword.

“Golden Firmament Sword!” Lin Yun became bolder as he reached out and the third sword appeared without needing Ye Guhan to speak. A golden radiance then spread out. Death, lightning, and sharpness, the auras given off by the three swords were different, and their characteristics were brought to the limit. But when they overlapped together, the temperament released by Lin Yun became complicated.

Realizing that Lin Yun wasn’t bluffing, Ye Guhan inwardly sighed. If their master knew about this, he would probably be happy. After all, their master doted on Lin Yun the most, and Lin Yun had grown to an unbelievable height. Not only was he first on the three rankings, but he was also the Heavenly Dragon Lord. In just six months, Lin Yun reached the pinnacle third stage of the Great Profound Sword Canon.

Master, did you know that this brat even wants to deal with Tian Xuanzi himself? Your beloved disciple didn’t let down your expectations. Ye Guhan’s eyes became watery as he looked at Lin Yun’s performance.

Lin Yun hovered in the air with three swords overlapping together, and he could sense that his sword aura was several times stronger than before. Most importantly, his sword intent had multiple attributes, and it was easier for him to deal with powerful opponents now. This was under the condition that he didn’t use the Great Profound Sword Seal to multiply his sword intent by threefold.

“Senior Brother, how is it?” Lin Yun hovered in the air, maintaining the appearance of the three swords and lowered his head to look at Ye Guhan. This performance was a success, and he was quite proud of it.

When Ye Guhan came to his senses, he covered his forehead, and smiled, “Not bad. But you’re not too familiar with it, so let me practice with you.”

Ye Guhan waved his hand and three swords appeared behind him. They were also the Divine Firmament Sword, Indigo Firmament Sword, and the Golden Firmament Sword. But compared to Lin Yun, Ye Guhan’s sword aura was more restrained. They looked like three ordinary swords hovering behind him.

But the three ordinary swords gave Lin Yun a great pressure because the three swords looked realistic and weren’t condensed with saint aura. When they both brought out the Divine Firmament Sword, Lin Yun’s Divine Firmament Sword immediately crumbled.

“Junior Brother, you’re not that good at it. Let me teach you. That’s not how you use the Divine Firmament Sword.? It has to combine with the Great Profound Sword Array,” Ye Guhan smiled. “The Great Profound Sword Array has thirty-six variations, but they’re similar because they all originated from the changes of each peak, such as the Divine Firmament Nine Transformations.”

With a roar, Ye Guhan reached out and the Divine Firmament Sword flew out with a whoosh, before the sword divided into nine. The nine swords shot out, with the swords forming a circle and they swiftly rotated like a blooming flower.

Behind him, a massive mountain rose from the ground as the nine swords moved, and the mountain grew so tall that it looked like it wanted to split the sky apart. This was the Divine Firmament Peak that Lin Yun was familiar with, looking like a towering sword.

The nine swords shone brightly as the Dao Comprehending Stage alternated between light and dark along with the sword ray.

“Got it now?” Ye Guhan smiled. He reached out, and each of the nine swords divided into nine again, soon reaching over a hundred swords that poured down like a waterfall.

This shocked Lin Yun as he quickly controlled the two swords to fend off the incoming attacks, but the two swords still crumbled the moment they came into contact with the others, and Lin Yun was sent flying a few hundred meters away.

Lin Yun’s internal organs were suffering heavy blows, and they were constantly being corroded by saint aura. Ye Guhan ignored this, sending the Indigo Firmament Sword out, and dividing it into nine with another mountain rising from the ground. Soon, the Golden Firmament Peak appeared as well.

Ye Guhan controlled the three mountains with countless swords behind him, looking like a deity at this moment while manipulating tens of thousands of swords. This made Lin Yun’s scalp become numb. Regardless of his sword intent or aura, they were all being suppressed.

He could only flee as Ye Guhan’s swords released three dazzling sword rays that poured down like a waterfall from beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven. A sword echoed in the sky as thunderstorms began to rumble.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to be covered in wounds, and he couldn’t even put up any resistance.

“This is the power of the Great Profound Sword Array, but it exhausts too much saint aura. So you can’t use it so easily,” Ye Guhan said. “It’s mainly because it’s easy for you to fail if you face multiple enemies. Let me teach you the final move.”

“Great Profound Sword Array—Myriad Swords Unite!” Ye Guhan’s hands clasped together and the three mountains combined together, releasing a huge explosion that seemed to want to blow heaven and earth apart.

The three peaks combined into one as all the swords merged together. When Ye Guhan pointed forth, thousands of sword rays around Ye Guhan exploded with a boundless sword ray unleashed from his finger.

The terrifying sword ray tore apart the space with ancient runes engraved on the sword ray. When an explosion took place, the Dao Comprehending Stage shattered apart in front of Lin Yun, and this left Lin Yun dumbfounded with his mouth wide open.

Ye Guhan scratched his head as he looked at the shattered Dao Comprehending Stage. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Recall!” Ye Guhan recalled all the swords and mountains before he landed beside Lin Yun.

“These are your rewards, and I took them for you,” Ye Guhan smiled as he took out a pouch and shoved it in Lin Yun’s hand.

This instantly made Lin Yun excited because his rewards were finally here.

“I’ll go out first,” Ye Guhan smiled.

Lin Yun smiled as he replied, “Together, let’s go out together.”

“Don’t worry and continue cultivating here. You can still stay seven to eight days here, so don’t waste it,” Ye Guhan smiled.

“Alright. I’ll listen to you,” Lin Yun replied after a brief pondering.

“As expected of my junior brother!” Ye Guhan smiled. He comforted Lin Yun and left the secret realm. He immediately saw the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord running towards him in a hurry.

The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord was anxious as he asked, “Sword Saint, what happened inside?”

“Nothing much. That brat went a little too strong and destroyed the Dao Comprehending Stage,” Ye Guhan replied.

“Oh, the Dao Comprehending Stage exploded. Wait, what?! The Dao Comprehending Stage exploded?” Heavenly Yi Saint Lord came to his senses, and his face changed. He muttered, “I-I have to take a look at the situation inside.”

Ye Guhan smiled, “don’t bother. That brat probably doesn’t know that he’s in trouble. He’s still young, so don’t frighten him. Just settle this with the Dragon Origin Great Saint, and don’t tell him about it.”

The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord came to his senses, and said, “Indeed, but I have to discuss this with the Dragon Origin Great Saint. Alas, it took hundreds of years to forge the Dao Comprehending Stage back then.”

“Well, he’s still young. Let’s go, don’t disturb him. Go and look for the Dragon Origin Great Saint,” Ye Guhan said.
