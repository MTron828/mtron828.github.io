Chapter 1385 - Visit

Anyone who saw Ye Ziling had to admit that she was beautiful, not to mention the heroic temperament around her couldn’t be found in many girls. That’s why many people were naturally awestruck when they saw Ye Ziling.

Even Lin Yun and the rest, who had interacted with Ye Ziling often, had to admit that she was beautiful. When Lin Yun glanced around, he saw many gazes on Ye Ziling and smiled, “Senior Sister Ye, it looks like you’re pretty popular.”

“I would’ve dug their eyes out if we were not in this inn.” Ye Ziling replied, glaring at Lin Yun. She wasn’t fond of attention because it would make her feel like she was in a zoo.

Lin Yun merely smiled in response because he knew that Ye Ziling had the strength to do it. When he swept his gaze over, there weren’t many who attracted his attention aside from one who had reached the Greater Elysium Core Realm, but there was nothing impressive. Reaching the Greater Elysium Core Realm before the age of twenty-five could be considered a top-tiered genius in the Profound Azure Prefecture; he could only be regarded as a mediocre genius in the entire Ancient Barren Domain. So Lin Yun didn’t pay much attention to that fellow.

Lin Yun ignored them, but this didn’t mean that the attention on Ye Ziling decreased. When Lin Yun’s group entered the courtyard, everyone began to ask about them.

In a luxuriously decorated room, many people were seated around one person. Judging from their clothes, they all came from the same sect, the Flowing Cloud Sect. This was the Greater Elysium Core Realm ‘genius’ that Lin Yun had taken an extra eye on, and his name was Jiang Tao.

The Flowing Cloud Sect could be considered an average sect in the Ancient Barren Domain. The sect had a saint in it, so the sect could be comparable to an ordinary Saint Clan. It might be nothing compared to the Sword Sect, but it was a giant compared to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

As a sect that could survive in the Ancient Barren Domain for so long, despite the intense competition, the Flowing Cloud Sect wasn’t weak.

“Senior Brother, I’ve looked into them!” Several people entered the room and chuckled, “They’re disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and they’re here for the test. The one with long legs is Ye Ziling.”

“Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?” Everyone was baffled when they heard that because they had never heard of such a sect before, so they shouldn’t be from the Ancient Barren Domain. But since there were many powerful inheritances and forces in the Eastern Desolation, just because they didn’t hear of it didn’t mean that it was weak.

“It’s normal that Senior Brother didn’t hear of it before. It’s a sect located in the Profound Azure Prefecture, a wilderness,” smiled a disciple of the Flowing Cloud Sect.

“Haha! People of the wilderness dare to participate in the Sword Sect’s test?”

“This is interesting!”

“Hahaha, such a beautiful woman is from the wilderness? Senior Brother, you just have to tell her your identity, and she’ll probably end up in your bed tonight.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“I don’t think Senior Brother even has to open his mouth to ask!” The other disciples had disdain reflected in their eyes when they heard that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was from the Profound Azure Prefecture. They even felt that it was Ye Ziling’s glory to be together with their senior brother.

Their senior brother, Jiang Tao, had an extraordinary temperament. Not only was his cultivation the highest, but his temperament was also unique when compared to everyone else.

Jiang Tao snorted after glancing at everyone. He was from the Jiang Saint Clan in the Ancient Barren Domain with a saint in his clan, meaning he was someone of extraordinary birth. The Jiang Saint Clan could be considered as one of the ten Saint Clans in the Ancient Barren Domain.

But Jiang Tao wasn’t a direct descendant of the clan, he was only a branch descendant, not to mention that he also didn’t have a heaven-defying talent. So this meant he didn’t receive any attention from the Jiang Saint Clan, so he left for the Flowing Cloud Sect.

After he entered the Flowing Cloud Sect, he smoothly became the chief disciple and received more resources than when he was in the Jiang Saint Clan. Furthermore, he had always felt superior in the Flowing Cloud Sect.

“Silence. I only asked you to ask around, so mind your words. Do I look like a lecher in your eyes? Don’t you guys know shame as swordsmen?” Jiang Tao coldly questioned.

His words instantly stunned everyone, and none of them dared to utter a word. They weren’t like this usually, and they didn’t have much concern after hearing that those people came from the Profound Azure Prefecture. To those from the Ancient Barren Domain, the Profound Azure Prefecture was no different from the wilderness, and people who came from there were no different from barbarians. So they couldn’t help feeling ashamed after listening to Jiang Tao’s reprimand.

But then, Jiang Tao’s tone suddenly changed, “But it’s natural for a gentleman to court a beauty. We can visit them tonight.”

“Hahaha! Senior Brother will surely succeed!”

“They’re mere barbarians from the wilderness; only someone like Senior Brother can be considered a true man!”

“Senior Brother is from the Jiang Saint Clan, so that woman will surely know what that means.” Everyone was briefly stunned before they started flattering Jiang Tao.

Jiang Tao didn’t have any changes on his face, but violent waves were bellowing in his heart because such a gorgeous woman was rare, even in the Ancient Barren Domain. He couldn’t believe she came from a wilderness like the Profound Azure Prefecture. He just hoped Ye Ziling wouldn’t disappoint him.

Jiang Tao closed his eyes. He was a prideful person. So he didn’t think of failure when he made a move. So he was planning what to do after he succeeded. Why did he want to bring everyone over? This was because he didn’t want to give others an excuse to speak badly about him.

After everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect entered the courtyard, Lin Yun took out the Divine Astral Pellets to cultivate after returning to his room. In his violet palace, the fourth strand of the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura was about to manifest.

Once he circulates the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, the four strands of the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura would reach a terrifying power. But since Lin Yun hadn’t fought with anyone, he still had no idea how strong they were. But it shouldn’t be an issue for him to instantly kill ordinary Greater Elysium Core Realm experts.

When night came, Lin Yun opened his eyes. The few hundred Divine Astral Pellets around him had been exhausted.

“Looks like I’m broke now.” Lin Yun sighed. The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon was no different from a bottomless pit, and he had exhausted nearly a thousand Divine Astral Pellets in just half a day. This also meant that he had used up all the resources he had on him. The only good news was that the foundation he had built on the Profound Wither Island was too vast, and he was still digesting it.

“The Great Saint Origin has nine seals, and each seal will bring me spiritual energy that far exceeds saint elixirs. But I have no idea when I can unlock the second seal, and it’s too unrealistic to place my hopes on it,” muttered Lin Yun. He suddenly realized that he was penniless.

He had a huge harvest in the Profound Wither Island. But regardless of the Azure Dragon Saint Art or Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, the resources he needed were too massive. If it were Feng Zhang or the others, even ten years wouldn’t be enough for them to digest the harvest if they were in his position.

“Lin Yun, when will you give this empress my 500 kilograms of True Dragon Saint Liquid?” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the sword box.

“Hush. I’m having a headache now.” Lin Yun only hoped to gather all the resources he needed after joining the Sword Sect. Aside from the True Dragon Saint Liquid, he also urgently required a dragon bone. Without a dragon bone, his Azure Dragon Saint Art would be lacking, no matter what.

“Let’s go out and take a look, then.” In the end, Lin Yun decided to look around.

This place was usually bustling, to begin with. But with the test approaching, the number of people in the city has reached an unprecedented height. This city was close to the Sword Sect, so the flourishing sight here was comparable to an imperial city.

When Lin Yun came to the main hall, he could hear a commotion outside the pavilion. Ye Ziling was seated before a desk, wearing a cold expression with killing intent flashing in her pupils.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun asked Wang Yuruo, who was to the side.

Wang Yuruo sneaked a peek at Ye Ziling before she said softly, “Someone wanted to visit Senior Sister Ye. Senior Brother Feng and Senior Brother Zhang are outside stopping them, but there are more and more people coming over.”

“Looks like everyone really treats the Profound Azure Prefecture as a wilderness!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with rage because he had instantly figured everything out.

Back on the Profound Wither Island, all the big sects from the Ancient Barren Domain had never placed cultivators from the Profound Azure Prefecture in their eyes, but he never expected that it would be the same in the Sword Sect.

Intruding a private residence was a rude act, and there were so many people gathered outside. This only meant they didn’t place the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect in their eyes. But speaking of which, he didn’t expect that Ye Ziling’s charm would be so great, since he didn’t notice it at all back in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

Outside the pavilion, many people gathered to pay Ye Ziling a visit, which was something that Liu Qingyan and Feng Zhang had never experienced before.

“Get your senior sister to come out. Is it that hard to meet with us?”

“They’re just barbarians from the wilderness and have the guts to put up airs with us?”

“A bunch of people from the Profound Azure Prefecture wishes to join the Sword Sect? What a pipe dream. But you guys might have a chance if you guys form a good relationship with us!” Those people outside were already running out of patience.

As for Liu Qingyan and Feng Zhang, their faces were already ugly. They weren’t looking down on them, but they didn’t place them in their eyes. They knew that the Profound Azure Prefecture was nothing in the eyes of the Eastern Desolation, but they didn’t expect that they would take it this far.

“What’s with the uproar?” Jiang Tao came, leading the Flowing Cloud Sect’s party. Seeing so many people gathered here, he couldn’t help locking his brows together.

When the crowd saw Jiang Tao, they immediately became quiet because they had long heard of this chief disciple from the Flowing Cloud Sect. Jiang Tao was from the Jiang Saint Clan with his cultivation at the Greater Elysium Core Realm. He was only twenty-five this year, achieved greater mastery in the sky sword intent, and grasped the cloud intent simultaneously. So he could be considered a somewhat formidable genius. If there were no accidents, it shouldn’t be an issue for him to enter the Sword Sect.

The door opened with Lin Yun and Ye Ziling walking out right then. When everyone glanced at Ye Ziling from afar, they were all breath taken by her beauty, and their breathing became hurried. They couldn’t imagine that someone of Ye Ziling’s beauty would come from the Profound Azure Prefecture, and they began to wonder if Ye Ziling had opened the door for them.

Jiang Tao smiled because he thought Ye Ziling knew about his identity. Standing ten-odd meters away, he smiled, “My name is Jiang Tao, and I’m grateful that Lady Ye has opened your door for me.”

Lin Yun had some impression of this person because Jiang Tao was the only person who had reached the Greater Elysium Core Realm in this inn. But there was nothing impressive about this Jiang Tao besides being shameless.
