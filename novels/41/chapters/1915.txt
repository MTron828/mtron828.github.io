Chapter 1916 - Sword Of The Beginning

Looking at the Sword Heart in his hand, Lin Yun was filled with emotions. In their first meeting, the old Sword Saint gave him his Sword Heart, and yet Lin Yun didn’t even know his name. Starting today, the thirty-six wooden houses would only be left with thirty-five unless a new Sword Saint takes over.

“Ye Qingtian, you don’t have to carry it all on your shoulders. But do remember that you still have your sword when heaven collapses one day. Everything in this world will disappear one day, not to mention I’ve been dead for many years.”

Lin Yun could still hear what the Sword Saint said at the end.

Lin Yun placed the Sword Heart against his forehead. When the Sword Heart was placed against it, it shone brightly and melted into it. The purple Sword Heart was like a pebble dropping into the lake. His Sword Sea, which was only a thousand feet, had grown to ten thousand feet, clear like a mirror.

The purple Sword Heart soon sank into his Sword Sea, and it only caused a ripple before it calmed down. He still couldn’t refine this Sword Heart with his current cultivation. In reality, it wouldn’t be easy to refine this Sword Heart even for a Sword Saint because it contained the will of a swordsman, and a swordsman’s will was the hardest to obliterate. He would be injured if he tried to refine the Sword Heart if he wasn't careful.

The old Sword Saint wanted Lin Yun to integrate the Sword Heart into his sword sea to nourish his physique and soul in the future, slowly absorbing it. Aside from that, it would protect his soul against a Saint’s mental energy and could make his opponent suffer significantly.

According to the old Sword Saint, some Ancient Clans would integrate a Sword Heart into their descendant before they were born, and their descendants would be able to possess an innate Sword Heart with that, along with an ancient divine physique. But geniuses of that caliber disappeared ever since the Golden Era was destroyed and the Heavenly Path was broken.

After integrating the Sword Heart into his Sword Sea, Lin Yun activated the Three-Lives Fruit and entered the Three-Lives Realm. He took out several three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits, and could sense a warm current flowing throughout his limbs, vitality, and dragon origin.

When three-colored radiances bursting from Lin Yun, they enveloped him. He had learned his lesson before and didn’t dare to overeat them. He only ate a few before he immediately started to refine them. After he was done refining them, his cultivation stabilized at the pinnacle fourth channel of the Profound Death Stage, and his Sword Sea expanded.

“As expected of the Heavenly Cloud Fruits… It’s no wonder why so many people within the Heavenly Dao Sect wanted them.” Lin Yun continued to consume more Heavenly Cloud Fruits and spent his time refining them.

Without him knowing it, he already spent a month within the Three-Lives Realm and successfully made a breakthrough to the fifth channel in the Profound Death Stage. He was only one step away from reaching the pinnacle.

Now, he only had ten three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits left, and none of the four-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits left. This was because the three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits could no longer help him. If he wanted to refine more, he would need a stronger version of the Heavenly Cloud Fruits.

Thus, he spent his remaining time practicing the Divine Firefly Sword.

“Firefly Radiance!”

“Dawn Radiance!”

“Sunset Radiance!”

“Waning Moon!”

“Heavenly Snowing Mountain!”

“Silver Blood!”

“Indigothunder Azurefrost!”

“Rising Sun!”

“Radiant Moon Heart!”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Myriad Swords Unite!”

Two months later, Lin Yun reached the tenth sword form in the Divine Firefly Sword. The Divine Firefly Sword had thirteen swords, and the Radiant Sword Saint once said each sword form was powerful. Each sword form could be comparable to a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique.

Many people had practiced the Divine Firefly Sword. Every holy land and ancient clan had a copy of it, but it was simply unheard of for anyone to reach the tenth sword form before reaching the Nirvana Stage. After successfully practicing the tenth sword form, Lin Yun took a deep breath within the Three-Lives Realm and swung his sword.

When he swung his sword, he appeared a hundred meters away, and his sword shone with a brilliant sword ray. In the path of the sword ray, it left a cut in space.

A loud sword vibration echoed, and this sword was terrifying, with space a hundred meters away overlapping together. It was as though the gate was being pushed open, and a ray of light shone brightly from the torn space. This sword was the new Sword of the Beginning, the first gleam of light in the world that Lin Yun had further perfected.

“This sword seems to have come in contact with space dao.” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts after sheathing his sword. Many people knew about the Divine Firefly Sword, but no one reached his level. On the other hand, the Sword of the Beginning belonged to him.

“That’s only a ray of light. What if there are a few more rays?” Lin Yun fell into deep thought, and a terrifying scene appeared. When he swung his sword, the surrounding space was like a mirror that reflected his sword ray. Space began to overlap, and the light was reflected when Lin Yun sheathed his sword.

This gave him a feeling as he stood on the spot while his opponent’s head rolled on the ground, and he only needed one sword. This made Lin Yun’s gaze blaze with flames, and felt that this was too unbelievable. If he could really accomplish it, there was no way his opponent could withstand his attack if they didn’t block it. At that time, his opponent would die regardless of their cultivation.

“It might seem impossible, but there might be a possibility if I can grasp the Astral Sword Intent.” Lin Yun pondered before stowing the three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits and leaving the Three-Lives Realm.

When he came out, he waited another two days before heading to the Heavenly Dao Altar with Chen Feng to sign up for the Ranking Battle. As for the remaining Heavenly Cloud Fruits, he gave them all to Chen Feng.

This surprised Chen Feng, and he wasn’t willing to accept it.

“Take it. There’s no longer an effect for me to refine them. If you think you have too many of them, you can share them with the other saint disciples within the Indigo Thunder Peak,” Lin Yun said casually.

After hearing what Lin Yun said, Chen Feng finally accepted the Heavenly Cloud Fruits. He asked, “Senior Brother, are you going to pick the Di Group on the Ranking Battle?”

“I can’t?” Lin Yun asked.

“You can, but you’ll be the center of attention because many people envy you,” Chen Feng said, scratching his head. “The limit of Di Group is the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and it’s too risky for you. It’s fine if you’re humiliated if you lose. But if they don’t hold back their attacks, you might even lose your life…”

“I’ll lose my life? Who dares to kill the direct disciple of the Dragon Origin Great Saint?”

“That’s not it. Senior Brother, there are many deaths in the Ranking Battle every time, and no one will know if it’s really a mistake or if it was on purpose. Even the Dragon Origin Great Saint won’t be able to pursue it on the surface.” Chen Feng sighed and continued, “Ye Feifan must want to find an opportunity to take revenge against you during the Ranking Battle.”

“It doesn’t matter. I’ll give him this opportunity.” Lin Yun nodded his head. If he wasn’t worried that he might expose his trump cards, he wanted to partake in the Tian Group. After all, the rewards for the top ten in the Tian Group were even higher than the champion of Di Group.

When they arrived at the Heavenly Dao Altar, there were four stages on the plaza, and many people have gathered here. The stages were made of saint metals, and they were like miniature mountains. Furthermore, the stages were massive and covered in top-graded spiritual arrays that even a Quasi-Saint would have difficulty destroying.

All the saint disciples within the Heavenly Dao Sect were gathered here. The stages were divided into Tian, Di, Xuan, and Huang.

When Lin Yun stepped on the Heavenly Dao Altar, many ordinary disciples were already gathered here to observe the competition. The fight between saint disciples was a grand event within Heavenly Dao Sect, but they could only be in the audience.

“So many saint disciples are here. I remember that Senior Brother Huang Xuan is over ninety years old and even has a grandson, right?”

“So what if he’s over ninety? He’s at the Nirvana Stage. He can make a breakthrough into the Quasi-Saint Realm within fifty years, and his lifespan will be different at that time.”

“There are so many old saint disciples, and I’m afraid there are no opportunities for newly conferred saint disciples.”

“It’s not difficult for these old saint disciples to make it into the top ten, but the top three have always been young saint disciples, and there are no exceptions.”

“Bai Shuying is here!” An uproar resounded outside the Heavenly Dao Altar as the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s appearance instantly captivated everyone. She was calm and chose the Tian Group, as everyone had expected.

There were barely a hundred people in the Tian Group. Everyone was at least at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. They were either old saint disciples of nearly a hundred or young monstrous geniuses. Everyone there could be considered peerless geniuses within the Eastern Desolation, and they didn’t have many opponents within the same generation.

Ye Qingtian’s appearance also caused a decent commotion because many people were curious about which group he would pick. The Huang Group had the most people of the four groups because almost all newly conferred saint disciples would pick it.

Some who reached the Nirvana Stage picked the Huang Group. After all, the reward for Huang Group’s champion was better than being ranked bottom in the other groups. The highest intensity in the Ranking Battle was practically in the Huang Group.

But Ye Qingtian passed by the Huang Group without turning back.

“He didn’t pick the Huang Group!”

“He didn’t pick the Xuan Group, either!” The surroundings became quiet as everyone looked at Lin Yun, waiting to see which group he would pick.

“Are you sure about this?” The person responsible for the registration corner was a Quasi-Saint. When he saw Ye Qingtian walking over, he warned, “Generally speaking, no one will pick this group if they haven’t reached the Nirvana Stage. You’re simply courting death when you’re only at the Profound Death Stage.”

“Then, let me see how ‘Death’ is spelled,” Lin Yun smiled and wrote his name down.

This made everyone take in a breath that Ye Qingtian picked the Di Group.

“Why is Ye Qingtian going to the Di Group when he’s only at the Profound Death Stage…”

“Ye Qingtian, you actually picked the Di Group for real!” A figure walked over to the Di Group’s registration corner.

Everyone saw this person, but they weren’t surprised because this was the Dao Yang Palace’s Ye Feifan. But when they saw the person beside him, their faces changed because this person was Zhang Yue. It turned out that Zhang Yue had recovered from his injuries, and he even made a breakthrough, reaching the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

“Ye Qingtian, it has been a long time since we met,” Zhang Yue sneered eerily.
