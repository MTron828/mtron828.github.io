Chapter 1320 - Let Everyone Know About Lin Yun!

Just like that, the transcendent genius of the Flame Dragon Sect, the mastermind who gathered the eight big sects, died right before everyone’s eyes. With an explosion of golden-purple light that was accompanied by a draconic roar, Bai Luli no longer existed in the world. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Tian, Zhang Ting, and Jiang Lichen, who finally arrived, were dumbfounded when they saw this scene. They were slower than Lin Yun, and when they arrived, they could only see the seven transcendent geniuses lying on the ground. They were shocked by Bai Luli’s death before they could even make an exclamation.

Just like that, the transcendent genius Bai Luli was reduced to specks of dust by Lin Yun. This was simply too terrifying, and both Qin Tian and Zhang Ting’s lips were twitching. Didn’t Lin Yun just say that he had a good temper?

Not only the cultivators around the Silversnow Mountain Range, but those outside the Profound Wither Island were so dumbfounded that they couldn’t utter a single word. As for the elders of the eight big sects, their faces had naturally become black.

The target hadn’t come, and Lin Yun alone had swept through the transcendent geniuses of the eight big sects. Lin Yun was already arrogant outside the Profound Wither Island. Not only was it unexpected that Lin Yun was not domesticated on the island, he became even greater than before. He didn’t even hesitate when he killed Bai Luli before the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts.

“No!” One of the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts wailed when he landed on the ground before his eyes blazed with a boundless killing aura. As a flaming jiao-dragon appeared behind him, the flaming jiao-dragon instantly turned the entire sky red, making it appear as though the sky was being incinerated at this moment.

This was a grey-clothed old man, he was an elder of the Flame Dragon Sect. But he didn’t think that Bai Luli would die before his eyes just like that.

When the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts descended to the ground, they were all emitting a terrifying aura that sealed off this entire region, and their saint artifacts were focused on Lin Yun. As for the six transcendent geniuses who were lying on the ground, they noticed that the pressure on them had been lifted. They quickly stood up and left without daring to stay behind.

But Lin Yun had ignored them and swept his gaze over the eight elders. They were already Greater Elysium Core Realm experts before they entered the Profound Wither Island. But now, their auras were even more powerful than before. They had clearly become the top of the pyramid on the Profound Wither Island with their strength reaching terrifying heights.

“Bastard, have you thought of how you’re going to die?” The grey-clothed old man from the Flame Dragon Sect squeezed his words through his teeth as he wielded a saint sword.

But Lin Yun didn’t bother with them and radiated his firmament sword intent to confirm that there were only the eight of them. He could sense several terrifying auras outside the mountain range. They must be related to the Profound Sky Sect. The eight people standing before him were just the surface layer.

“There’s no need to hurry.” A robust middle-aged man with the hairstyle of a lion’s mane stopped the grey-clothed old man. “Young lad, you’re already destined to die after killing Bai Luli. But as long as you’re willing to cooperate, I can consider giving you a chance.”

He clearly had the bloodline of demonic beasts, and the monarch aura he was faintly emitting was terrifying. With just a glance, anyone could tell that he was the elder of the Myriad Beast Gate, and he had an extraordinary bloodline, possessing the bloodline of the Monarch Demonic Lion.

Everyone who heard him became unhappy, especially the grey-clothed elder from the Flame Dragon Sect. He was glaring at the middle-aged man with flames blazing in his pupils.

“Oh? Can your words represent everyone, then?” Lin Yun asked with interest.

“My words can naturally hold some weight. Now, it depends on your choice,” smiled the middle-aged man.

“Go on. I’m listening,” replied Lin Yun.

“If you can tell us Flower Burial’s location or his identity, I can give you a chance,” smiled the middle-aged man, and the other Greater Elysium Core Realm experts immediately turned their eyes over.

The reason why they came with such a huge formation wasn’t only for the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. They came for Flower Burial. Not only was Flower Burial the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, but he also had an irreversible feud with the Profound Sky Sect. There were also rumors that the Profound Wither Key was with Flower Burial.

“So, you guys will spare my life if I tell you guys?” Lin Yun asked, seemingly to be tempted by the middle-aged man’s suggestion.

His words instantly made the grey-clothed old man nervous. After all, Lin Yun had killed Bai Luli, and even if Lin Yun did reveal information about Flower Burial, the Flame Dragon Sect still had to kill him, no matter what.

“Young man, you’re still young. You have no idea about the other terrifying things in the world that are more terrifying than death, such as the Blood Puppet Sect’s means. They can turn you into a corpse puppet. My Myriad Beast Gate can feed you to tree demons, or the Azure Thunder Sect could plant lightning parasites in you to let you experience something worse than death!” The middle-aged man continued to smile, but his smile was eerie.

“As long as you can tell me Flower Burial’s traces, I can’t spare your life, but I can give you a straightforward death without any pain,” smiled the middle-aged man, acting as if that was his greatest grace.

“You’re really benevolent,” said Lin Yun indifferently. “Well, there’s no harm telling you about it. I am Flower Burial.”

Hearing his words, the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts were first briefly stunned before their faces became cold. They felt that Lin Yun was toying with them, and they didn’t think that he could be Flower Burial from his current cultivation, not to mention his appearance.

“How regretful, then,” said the middle-aged man. His smile disappeared from his face.

“Why waste so much time talking to him? We can just torture and interrogate him. I don’t even think he knows anything about Flower Burial,” said one of the eight Elysium Core Realm experts in an annoyed tone.

“Don’t tell me that you guys are afraid that he has other means. If you guys don’t have the guts, then let me suppress him!” The middle-aged woman from the Flame Phoenix Sect said with cold killing intent brewing in her pupils. After all, her blood relative was killed by Lin Yun outside the Profound Wither Valley, so she was naturally filled with hatred for him.

“Don’t compete with me! I’ll slaughter that brat!” The grey-clothed old man roared with his face turning red. His endurance had already reached the limit, and this made Qin Tian and the rest behind Lin Yun scared to the point that their faces turned pale. They were also beginning to tremble in fear. After all, those were eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts, each wielding a saint artifact, and the auras that they were releasing were too terrifying.

“Am I so weak in your eyes that you guys are fighting over who will kill me?” Lin Yun smiled indifferently.

.

“That’s right. Who the hell do you think you are? You’re nothing in my eyes!” The grey-clothed old man finally couldn’t hold it back and charged over. His entire body was surging with astral energy and blazing flames that made him look like a jiao-dragon in a sea of flames.

This instantly made the faces of Qin Tian’s party change with their hearts sinking. After all, these people before them weren’t like other transcendent geniuses. They had long reached the Greater Elysium Core Realm. After placing their lives at risk, they were swiftly rewarded with their cultivation reaching the pinnacle of the Greater Elysium Core Realm.

Each of them had lived for at least two to three hundred years, not to mention that they were from big sects, which gave them a terrifying foundation. This was why they never placed Lin Yun in their eyes right from the beginning.

Lin Yun was also surprised, but fortunately, he wasn’t weak either, or he would be easily suppressed by them.

As the surrounding space began to distort from the high temperature, the grey-clothed old man threw out a punch that looked like a dragon claw. Facing his attack, Lin Yun also threw out a punch with all his purple-golden dragon runes gathered together.

When the two punches collided together, the entire ground began to violently tremble. The other Greater Elysium Core Realm experts were shocked by Lin Yun’s strength. When the commotion caused by their collision dispersed, the grey-clothed old man had blood dripping down from the corner of his lips while he took ten-odd steps back. But that wasn’t all, his hand was also trembling from the pain.

“W-what’s going on?” Everyone was shocked that the grey-clothed old man would actually suffer a loss in a frontal confrontation with Lin Yun. The grey-clothed old man also had shock and rage intertwining in his pupils. He never expected that Lin Yun would be so strong.

“I see, as expected of someone at the pinnacle of the Greater Elysium Core Realm. You only suffered some superficial injuries after taking my attack head-on,” muttered Lin Yun. He was speaking the truth because he could kill those at the Lesser Elysium Core Realm when he was at the Galaxy Stage. Now, he has reached the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm, manifested his Sovereign Constellation, absorbed nearly seven million Divine Astral Pellets, and his Azure Dragon also underwent a drastic transformation.

This was why his punch could easily kill transcendent geniuses in the same generation. But the grey-clothed old man only suffered some superficial injuries, and this was simply too terrifying. When the grey-clothed old man heard what Lin Yun said, he nearly threw out a mouthful of blood. He was at the pinnacle of the Greater Elysium Core Realm, and he was a lot older than Lin Yun. But he was being judged by someone of the younger generation on his strength, so how could he not be enraged?

“What arrogance!” The grey-clothed old man raged and drew out his saint sword before charging at Lin Yun. When he swung his sword down, he unleashed a crescent sword ray from his sword that blazed like a flaming jiao-dragon at the same time.

“That’s a pretty good sword,” commented Lin Yun.

“This is an imitation of the Divine Artifact, the Snowdragon Sword. It’s a monarch saint artifact with eight hundred saint runes and even a droplet of jiao-dragon’s true blood in it.” Qin Tian transmitted his voice to Lin Yun.

Wielding the Snowdragon Sword, the grey-clothed old man approached and unleash countless sword rays. Seeing this, Lin Yun no longer held back and the Blood Flame Divine Rune began to blaze in the Azure Dragon Mark. As his hand turned into a dragon claw, he faced the grey-clothed old man with the Azure Dragon Grasp.

At the same time, three thousand purple-golden dragon runes blazed in his palm, emitting a dazzling golden light. Not only was it the strongest state of Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Art, it also contained an unprecedented azure dragon’s aura.

When the dragon claw and sword ray collided, a dazzling light exploded from their confrontation. Seeing this, the middle-aged woman from the Flame Phoenix Sect snorted, “Hmph, he should’ve used the monarch saint artifact to suppress Lin Yun.”

But after a few hundred collisions, the grey-clothed old man threw out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying away. At the same time, there was a terrifying wound on his chest, and his wound had a black vortex that constantly emitted lightning that nearly tore the grey-clothed old man apart.

This instantly made the faces of the other Greater Elysium Core Realm experts change. At the same time, the middle-aged man with the hairstyle of a lion’s mane exclaimed in fear, “He’s at the level of fated transcendents!”

There was a huge difference between the fated transcendents and ordinary transcendents.

“So what if he’s a fated transcendent? We don’t have to be afraid of him if we join forces,” said the silver-haired old man coldly. What he said wasn’t wrong, since Lin Yun hadn’t reached the Elysium Core Realm. So even if he was a fated transcendent, he wasn’t invincible on the Profound Wither Island.

If eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts joined forces, who could stop them aside from those fated transcendents with an origin saint rune engraved on their elysium core?

A pair of phoenix wings unfolded behind the middle-aged woman. When the wings flapped, flames blew, forming into countless weapons that shot at Lin Yun. But Lin Yun wasn’t afraid. A pair of golden wings appeared behind him and also unfolded. When thunderstorms surged, the incoming flames were all blown away.

“Since you guys have come, then don’t leave!” Lin Yun roared. Ever since he manifested his Sovereign Constellation, he hadn’t undergone a huge battle yet. These people were coming for him, to begin with. So there was no need for him to hold back. As light exploded from him, the golden light enveloped the entire Silversnow Mountain Range.

“You want to face the eight of us at the same time? Aren’t you a little too arrogant?” The middle-aged woman attacked once again with phoenix flames blazing on the surface of her body as he formed an ancient seal towards Lin Yun.

Heaven and Earth Unite!

Executing the Divine Solar Lunar Fist, Lin Yun threw out a punch and destroyed the ancient seal, causing the middle-aged woman to throw out a mouthful of blood before she was sent flying away. At this moment, the three thousand purple-golden dragon runes had spread over his body, the Blood Flame Divine Rune in the Azure Dragon Mark had ignited, and he had also summoned the 49 Demonic Astral Flowers. At this moment, he wasn’t holding much back because he also wanted to test his current strength through this fight.

“Who the hell are you?!” The lion mane-hairstyled middle-aged man was baffled by Lin Yun’s strength.

But Lin Yun didn’t say a word and appeared before the lion mane-hairstyled middle-aged man with a flap of the golden wings behind him before unleashing the second form of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist, Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron.

As he stood in the air, his punch manifested into an ancient divine cauldron that slammed against the middle-aged man from the Myriad Beast Gate. His attack quickly destroyed the middle-aged man’s physique, and he nearly died under the attack.

“Who the hell are you?! It makes no sense for someone of your caliber to be nameless!” The middle-aged man had light circulating on his body and his wounds were recovering at a visible speed.

“I’ve already said that I’m Flower Burial.” Lin Yun mocked. “Weren’t you guys waiting for me? I’m here, but you guys aren’t recognizing me. Forget it, I’ll give you guys a fulfilling death and make sure you know not to be my enemy in the next lifetime!”

Lin Yun took out the Silver Moon Mask and put it on his face. In the next second, his hair began to grow and turned silver. Ever since he came to the Kunlun Realm, people only knew about Flower Burial and not Lin Yun. Today, Flower Burial would let everyone know about Lin Yun.
