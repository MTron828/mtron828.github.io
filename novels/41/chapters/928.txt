Chapter 929 - One Man Fights One Realm

The Bloodbone Demon Palm was an advanced fortune martial technique exclusive to the Bloodbone Realm. When Yuan Hengtian executed it, blood started surging behind him before condensing into a demonic emperor with a bewitching demonic radiance. Then, a skeletal palm tore through the clouds and descended towards Lin Yun.

If this attack landed, everyone in the ship would be buried along with Lin Yun. When the Bloodbone Demon Palm descended, the immense pressure pushed the entire ship down and geysers shot into the sky on both sides of the ship. The spectators were terrified by the phenomenon, but it was too late for them to run.

“Damn it!”

“We can’t escape anymore! Zhao Feng was right!”

“Damn it, are we really going to die here?” Everyone was full of despair.

“I guess this is it.” Even Zhao Feng couldn’t do anything. In desperation, he started accumulating the origin energy within his body in hopes that Lin Yun would negate most of the attacks, lessening the strength of the shockwave.

Suddenly, Lin Yun soared into the sky and formed a seal in one hand while making a fist with the other. He began to emit a golden brilliance that manifested into different phenomena.

With his clenched fist, Lin Yun threw a punch with boundless golden radiance.

“Divine Sun Breaking Seal!” Lin Yun roared while he punched the Bloodbone Demon Palm. In the next second, Yuan Hengtian’s Bloodbone Demon Palm crumbled. The golden flames from Lin Yun’s attack had completely incinerated Yuan Hengtian’s attack.

When everything settled down, Yuan Hengtian threw up a mouthful of blood as his face turned pale. His body was on the verge of collapse. When he dropped to one knee, he threw up a mouthful of blood with fragments of his organs.

“Imperial fortune martial technique!” Yuan Hengtian gritted his teeth as he looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. It made no sense for Lin Yun to practice an imperial fortune martial technique with his low cultivation.

After all, there was a clear difference between an overlord and an imperial fortune martial technique. Right at this moment, torrential killing intent poured out beside him as the last person standing from the Bloodbone Realm wanted to take this opportunity to kill or injure Lin Yun.

Knowing that this was an opportunity, Yuan Hengtian’s eyes flashed coldly. He knew that Lin Yun was greatly exhausted and would need a chance to recover. But when he turned around, blood splashed on his face as his companion was sliced in two.

Lin Yun landed on the ground while sheathing his sword. Yuan Hengtian mouths dropped at this scene. After recovering from shock, he exclaimed, “Greater dao artifact!”RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The sharpness of Lin Yun’s sword was comparable to a greater dao artifact. Not only did Lin Yun have an advanced fortune martial technique, a greater dao artifact, and incredibly powerful sword intent, his origin energy far exceeded those in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

So he couldn’t imagine how strong Lin Yun would become after going through his first tribulation. At this moment, he realized that Lin Yun was a terrifying monster with shocking potential. Yuan Hengtian swallowed his saliva as he watched Lin Yun slowly approach. He wasn’t sure if Lin Yun would also kill him.

As he laid there, a black figure suddenly shot over and snatched his interspatial pouch. By the time he realized it, his interspatial pouch was gone.

When Yuan Hengtian raised his head, he saw a cat grinning at him with an interspatial pouch in its hand. Then, the cat brandished its claws and ripped his clothes apart. It even snatched the jade hanging from his neck before leaving with dissatisfaction on its face.

“Lin Yun, you’re too much!” Yuan Hengtian’s face turned white because he was looted and stripped by a mere cat. As a genius on the Azure Dragon Ranking, he would become a laughingstock to others.

When Lin Yun saw this scene, his lips started to twitch. Lil’ Red seemed to be addicted to looting corpses. But it didn’t matter much to him since the Bloodbone Realm wasn’t going to let him off anyway. Since they wanted to take his life, they naturally had to be prepared to pay the price.

“Lin Yun, just because you have an advanced fortune martial technique and a greater dao artifact doesn’t mean you can face the Bloodbone Realm. No matter where you go, you can’t escape!” Yuan Hengtian said as he glared at Lin Yun. At this moment, he was trembling with humiliation.

“Who says that I’m running?” Lin Yun looked at Yuan Hengtian and said, “I’ll be at the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm’s Flamecloud City ten days from now. At that time, your Bloodbone Realm can come find me.”

No one thought that Lin Yun would issue a challenge of life and death in Flamecloud City.

Yuan Hengtian was briefly stunned when he heard that and asked again, “You sure about that?”

He began to wonder if Lin Yun was insane. After all, the Bloodbone Realm had third soul Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses who could easily suppress Lin Yun. In Yuan Hengtian’s view, Lin Yun was courting death.

“Why do you think I’m sparing you then?” replied Lin Yun.

At this moment, Yuan Hengtian knew that Lin Yun spared his life to deliver the message. Ridicule flashed in his eyes for a moment before he composed himself. After all, he didn’t want to provoke Lin Yun in fear that Lin Yun would go back on his words. “I won’t stop you from courting death. But if you want to live a little longer, you should run away.”

“Cut the crap. Have you ever seen a swordsman tuck his tail and run? Now, let’s talk. How did you find me?” Lin Yun asked.

With no hesitation, Yuan Hengtian revealed his method honestly. Then again, it didn’t matter because only an empyrean could erase Feng Wuji’s mark. There was nothing that Lin Yun could do about it.

It was more or less what Lin Yun had guessed. “You can leave now.”

Yuan Hengtian felt relieved. But as he stood up, he noticed that Lin Yun showed no signs of returning his interspatial pouch. Enraged, he questioned Lin Yun, “You want me to leave like this?”

“What’s wrong with it?” Lin Yun sneered.

Yuan Hengtian’s anger nearly drove him insane as he roared, “In ten days, the Bloodbone Realm will await your arrival in Flamecloud City!”

Then, Yuan Hengtian picked up a cloth to cover himself and ran for his life. No one could believe that the scene that they just saw was real, especially Zhao Feng.

He couldn’t believe that a genius on the Azure Dragon Ranking was easily defeated by Lin Yun and robbed by a Dragon-blooded Cat. Yuan Hengtian arrived so ferociously and was forced to leave without a single piece of clothing to cover himself. It was a scene that he would need a lot of time to digest.

Something like this had never happened in the Heavenly Path before, which meant that Lin Yun would become famous. The news would spread like wildfire and shake the entire Azure Dragon Region, maybe even the other regions. After all, it was unprecedented to challenge an entire realm.

Everyone could feel their blood boil. Normally, cultivators would run from the higher realms, but Lin Yun actually did the opposite. He issued a challenge against an entire realm. Who else but Lin Yun would have the gall to challenge an entire realm?
