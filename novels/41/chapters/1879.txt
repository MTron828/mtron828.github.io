Chapter 1880 - One More Move

Lin Yun’s words left everyone dumbfounded. What he said might sound arrogant, but it was actually shameless. So this naturally left all the ten-odd peaks’ disciples dumbfounded by how shameless Lin Yun was. Even the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples were stumped as they looked at Lin Yun with disbelief, and the corners of their lips twitched.

Chen Feng sighed because he knew that only Ye Qingtian would say something like that. Within the entire Heavenly Dao Sect, no one was as shameless as Ye Qingtian.

As for Su Ye, he was naturally furious to the point that he drew his sword and dashed forth, “Who the hell do I think I am? I’ll let you know shortly!”

Drawing his sword, Su Ye’s dragon origin exploded, and a terrifying chill swept out. The other peaks’ disciples were surprised because it was a different story if someone drew their swords in a confrontation. But they could also understand why Su Ye did it because even they wouldn’t be able to hold themselves back if they ran into someone as arrogant as Ye Qingtian.

When Su Ye dashed forth, he was like an icy bolt of lightning flashing forth with Frost and Lightning Intent contained in his attack. Aside from that, his sword intent had also reached the complete mastery of the Firmament Sword Intent. His cultivation wasn’t simple either because he was at the pinnacle second channel of the Profound Death Stage. So in their eyes, Ye Qingtian would naturally suffer at the hands of Su Ye today.

But Lin Yun merely raised his head and smiled, not intending to get up. This was a pretty good attack, which meant that the holy land’s geniuses had a sturdy foundation in their martial techniques. But it was a pity that Su Ye ran into him. Su Ye’s attack might seem flawless in the eyes of others, but it was filled with flaws in his eyes.

“Boring…” Lin Yun shook his head with disdain on his face. But when the sword was about to stab him, he gently waved his hand, smacking the sword with the back of his hand. His simple attack landed on the greatest flaw of Su Ye’s attack, and this smack contained his boundless dragon origin.

After Su Ye dashed forth, he had suddenly stopped in mid-air and began spinning around. After Su Ye spun three rounds in mid-air, he had shame and rage on his face after he stabilized himself.

Gulping down another spiritual fruit, Lin Yun wore a mocking smile, “Junior Brother Su, that’s a pretty nice dance you have there.”

“I’ll slaughter you!” Su Ye immediately lost it. But just when he was about to move, Lin Yun’s gaze suddenly turned cold, and he gently flicked his finger against Su Ye’s sword, causing the sword to smack against the latter’s chest and send him flying around.

“Senior Brother!” The faces of the disciples from the Blue Frost Peak changed, and they quickly stepped forth to support Su Ye. The surroundings fell into silence because Ye Qingtian had defeated two peaks so easily, which wasn’t like the Ye Qingtian they knew.

“This piece of garbage became stronger?”

“Just what did he experience in the past year to become so powerful?”

“Did he receive the infusion from the Ye Clan’s seniors?”

“He practically crawled out of the Heavenly Dao Sect a year ago. I can’t believe that he has actually risen…” A discussion broke out from the surroundings, and they all unhappily looked at Lin Yun.

“You’re weaker than I’ve expected, Junior Brother Su. You have fallen before I can even bring out my strength.” Lin Yun raised his cup and smiled at Su Ye.

Su Ye’s face turned red. He wasn’t a fool and knew he was no longer Ye Qingtian’s opponent. But he could do nothing and could only accept Ye Qingtian’s mockery. Holding onto his chest, Su Ye no longer had any face to stay around and quickly left the Nether Orchid Courtyard with his fellow disciples. “Ye Qingtian, don’t rejoice so quickly. I was careless today, and you’re shameless to purposely hide your strength!”

“Senior Sister Bai, can I participate in the Sword Discussion Gathering now?” Lin Yun lowered his cup and raised his brow at Bai Shuying.

Bai Shuying’s face was cold, but she said, “I have never seen someone as shameless as you before. You’re not afraid that I’ll kill you for appearing before me?”

When she finished, a terrifying killing intent swept out that caused the surrounding temperature in the Nether Orchid Courtyard to drop, and the killing intent made everyone tremble in fear. They all knew that Bai Shuying was genuinely furious, and everyone else immediately turned to look at Lin Yun with a playful expression.

“Senior Brother, why don’t we leave…?” Chen Feng whispered. The Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples couldn’t withstand the killing intent.

Lin Yun felt a chill run down his spine, and he could feel that Bai Shuying wanted to kill him if she had no reservations. But that reservation could be broken at any moment, and he could sense her suppressed rage.

“Hold on for a little longer.” Lil’ Purple’s voice came from the Iris Sword Box.

Lin Yun had no choice but to toughen his scalp, “Senior Sister Bai, do you misunderstand me?”

“I have never misunderstood you. If you want to sit here, take three swords from me, then.” Bai Shuying disrupted Lin Yun and flicked her finger. She shot out a sword ray that turned into a figure wielding a sword. When that figure dashed forth, it manifested into a terrifying phenomenon with a sword ray that could cut apart the ocean.

Lin Yun stabilized himself and gently patted his hands on the table, sending the disciples of the Indigo Thunder Peak away.

“Senior Brother is finished…” The faces of Chen Feng and others changed when they saw this scene. After all, Bai Shuying was the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden, and she could easily suppress Ye Qingtian with a hand if she personally made a move.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Everyone else in the surroundings wore a playful expression while watching Bai Shuying unleashing an attack against Ye Qingtian.

Lin Yun did not dare to take this attack lightly and secretly executed the Azure Dragon Grasp. As a vortex of thunderstorms appeared within his palm, Lin Yun reached out, and the incoming attack was grabbed by his sword. This scene was bizarre, giving everyone the illusion that Bai Shuying didn’t attack at all.

Everyone from the Nether Orchid Courtyard was briefly stunned and surprised. A few people raised their cups in mid-air and looked at this scene with disbelief.

Looking at all the overturned wine and fruits on the table, Lin Yun waved his hand and seized a cup from someone. Before that person could respond, Lin Yun gulped down the cup of wine and gave Bai Shuying a smile, “That’s one move.”

Ye Qingtian had a handsome face to begin with. His skin was even fairer than a woman's, which naturally made him even more charming. For a moment, all the female disciples forgot about what he had done, and their hearts couldn’t help but ripple. But their faces soon turned red, and they quickly dispelled their thoughts because Ye Qingtian was a lecher.

“Ye Qingtian, it looks like I have underestimated you!” Bai Shuying swiftly regained her composure after a brief shock.

“It’s fine. Our misunderstanding will be lifted in the future, and you will discover that there are many factors about me that you have underestimated.” Lin Yun replied with a casual smile, not knowing that his words, with Ye Qingtian's face, had a hidden meaning for everyone.

Everyone in the surrounding area broke into an uproar. Many of them thought that Ye Qingtian had changed, but it appears that he was still the same Ye Qingtian from a year ago.

“Senior Brother is a true man…” Everyone from the Indigo Thunder Peak had respect filling their pupils because their senior brother was probably the only one who dared to speak this way to Bai Shuying.

But Lin Yun’s face froze because he could sense that the surrounding atmosphere wasn’t right. But he had already said those words and couldn’t take them back.

Bai Shuying responded with a finger flick, unleashing another sword ray that turned into a black shadow that charged forth. This time, the table before Lin Yun was severed into two before he could even respond.

Just when that sword was about to land on Lin Yun’s chest, the latter stood up and clasped his hands together. The nearby cups flew out, streaking across the air while containing a powerful sword intent. Each cup weighed like a mountain, and nine landed at a different spot in the shadow while the last cup landed firmly on the sword tip.

As a powerful gale blew over, Lin Yun closed his eyes as his hair fluttered in the wind, revealing his handsome face. This made Lin Yun inwardly heave a sigh of relief and he wore a smile when he reopened his eyes.

Everyone in the surroundings was long dumbfounded as they stood up in disbelief. Even the Nether Orchid Courtyard and Holy Spirit Courtyard’s disciples were dumbfounded and couldn’t believe what they saw.

If Ye Qingtian had dodged this sword or faced this attack head-on and destroyed it, it wouldn’t have brought them so much shock. Not only was Ye Qingtian capable of finding nine flaws in this attack, he even used a special way to resolve it, which was simply unheard of.

After all, Bai Shuying’s attack was sudden, and it didn’t give Lin Yun time to prepare. In other words, her attacks were no different from sneak attacks.

Under everyone’s gazes, Lin Yun raised the cup on the sword tip and gulped the wine down. The shadow also began to dissolve as the eight other cups fell to the ground. But Lin Yun laughed as he opened his mouth, “Wine!”

The wine from the eight cups flew into his mouth, making his face even more rosy. “Hahaha! Good wine!”

When he tossed the cup in his hand on the ground, the cup shattered, which shocked everyone. After all, smashing an empty cup in someone’s territory was no different from provocation.

Caressing his hair, Lin Yun smiled with his eyes squinted, “Junior Brother Su might be a little ugly, but he’s right that one should fight upright. But it’s fine since Senior Sister Bai is so pretty.”

When Su Ye heard those words, his face changed because Lin Yun didn’t forget to step on him while flirting with Bai Shuying.

But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by what others thought, and he smiled at Bai Shuying, “Senior Sister, you have one move left!”
