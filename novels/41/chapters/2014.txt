Chapter 2015 - Brains

Within the treehouse inn, Xin Yan’s face changed, looking at Wang Muyan, who left with guilt. This matter today had taken twists and turns, and it was now related to Ye Qingtian, who had nothing to do with it. This instantly made Xin Yan wonder what Wang Muyan was planning.

Xin Yan already noticed Wang Muyan’s abnormal behavior, but everything had happened too quickly. Most importantly, she still had no idea what Wang Muyan was trying to do.

“Bring Nangong Fuye to the Six Holy City first to have his injuries examined and find a way to treat him.” Xin Yan recollected her thoughts and dealt with the immediate matter first. Nangong Fuye’s heart was damaged, and his life was still hanging by a thread, despite Wang Yue stabilizing his injuries.

“Isn’t it a little dangerous for the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden to go to the Myriad Graves Valley alone?” Wang Yue asked. He was hinting if they should get someone to follow Wang Muyan and see what she was trying to do.

“Why? Are you confident about catching up with her? And you’re confident you’ll be fine even after catching up?” Xin Yan said. It definitely wasn’t a good idea to send someone after Wang Muyan now. If they had someone chase after Wang Muyan, it would be an issue if they could protect themselves. So it was suitable to let Wang Muyan go by herself. But Nangong Fuye was injured, and Xin Yan became the leader of the Heavenly Dao Sect’s party.

Within Myriad Graves Valley, Lin Yun was sitting on a high platform with his hands on his knees, forming a different seal. A golden bead was hovering before his chest with a crimson radiance shining from the bead, enveloping his sword sea. A Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix were coiling around him with starlight shining on his forehead.

“The golden bead is truly extraordinary. It’s ten times stronger than the other beads, and the sins are more refined. There aren’t any side effects at all.” Lin Yun was almost done refining the golden bead and was only half a step from reaching the pinnacle of the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

As for his sword sea, it had reached a terrifying size that made him feel unbelievable. The massive sword sea reached six thousand feet, and the star had grown from the size of a pellet to a disc. But looking from afar, their proportions didn’t change, and they still looked the same. It’s just that it looked even more dazzling, like a genuine star.

Lin Yun’s sword intent had improved, and he wasn’t far from reaching greater mastery. More accurately speaking, he needed a quantitative transformation. Reaching the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage was harder than he had imagined, and his saint physiques suffered a continuous impact. He kept being injured and recovered.

Lin Yun was bearing the intense pain but didn’t give up. He bore the pain and didn’t dare to be careless. As time passed, blood began to ooze out from his pores. The blood would dry up in the morning, and there would be new wounds at night with blood flowing out. The blood had spread to a few feet in radius without him knowing it.

When Bai Qingyu opened her eyes and saw this scene, she was shocked and couldn’t help feeling heartache for Ye Qingtian. She finally knew why Ye Qingtian was so strong. Just his will was something no one could bear, and she could feel her scalp going numb. She never imagined that cultivating would be so painful. It turned out that Ye Qingtian was no genius, he had been bearing the pain while walking forth.

“Master, isn’t Big Brother Ye a little too harsh on himself?” Bai Qingyu asked.

Lil’ Purple sighed, “This is nothing. In terms of aptitude, he can’t be compared to you. You have to understand that he wasn’t born with a saint physique but acquired it later. You can’t imagine what he has suffered after coming so far.”

“What?!” Bai Qingyu was shocked. She came from a prestigious clan, and one had to be at least at the ninth-grade spiritual physique at the bare minimum. Even saint physiques weren’t particularly rare in the clans. Ancient Saint Clans had inheritances and resources; they could help their disciples acquire saint physiques, and only those with natal saint physiques were considered geniuses.

She possessed the Natal Yin Saint Physique but didn’t think much about it, and this was life. You generally wouldn’t cherish something you already have, but you have no idea that others might not be able to obtain it even if they spend ten to twenty years.

She never expected that Ye Qingtian didn’t even possess a spiritual physique. Such aptitude was pitiful even in a branch clan, not to mention the main clan.

“It’s really not easy for Big Brother Ye,” Bai Qingyu said respectfully.

“He’s already used to it,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Is that so…” Bai Qingyu muttered, and she sat down. She now knew why Ye Qingtian was so strong, and she had to work hard, or he would shake her off.

Five days later, fine cracks appeared on the golden bead before Lin Yun. When the bead exploded, Lin Yun threw out a mouthful of blood, his face becoming pale, and the surrounding phenomena shattered.

Lin Yun took a deep breath, raising his right hand before slowly pressing his hand down. The sword intent and nirvana aura that rampaged within his body began to slow down. But his body was still trembling, with fine cracks on his internal organs and ten dragon pulses. As he breathed out, he was pretty calm but muttered in pity, “I failed…”

The Nirvana Stage had nine transformations, and the difficulty of each transformation would increase, especially the last three transformations. The difficulties had reached an exaggerated height. Lin Yun already expected it and wasn’t expecting to succeed in one attempt.

The golden bead was too powerful, which gave him strong confidence, but he still failed. He recollected himself and examined his injuries. His injuries might seem terrifying, but they weren’t fatal and left no hidden injuries behind. This was good news because many people would be heavily injured or have hidden injuries that remained when they failed in their breakthrough.

Although Lin Yun had failed, he also benefited greatly from it. His saint aura reached six hundred thousand strands, and his foundation deepened. Then again, this also meant his next breakthrough would be tougher.

Bai Qingyu and Lil’ Purple quickly came over, looking at Lin Yun with worried gazes. Bai Qingyu nervously asked, “Big Brother Ye, are you alright?”

When she was done, she began to search her interspatial pouch, causing Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple to look at her curiously.

“I found it!” Bai Qingyu rejoiced as she took out a saint pellet. “This is the Revert Origin Pellet. My grandfather gave it to me and instructed me to use it if I failed to make a breakthrough. But I didn’t have an opportunity to use it.”

The Revert Origin Pellet could treat all sorts of injuries if someone failed in making a breakthrough at the Nirvana Stage, reverting their physical condition to before they attempted to make a breakthrough. This was a rare and bizarre saint pellet.

Lin Yun took it and swallowed it without any concern. The pellet was like a pebble thrown into the lake as flames spread throughout his body. He began to emit saint radiance, and he was recovering rapidly. By the time Lin Yun reopened his eyes, he had recovered from his injuries. Not only that, his physique and cultivation had been further refined, and this was the same as undergoing a small-scale nirvana.

“This is really bizarre.” Lin Yun was shocked and raised his head, “Thank you for your saint pellet.”

“It’s good that you’re alright now.” Bai Qingyu smiled. She was satisfied when Ye Qingtian thanked her.

“Let’s have a drink to celebrate.” Lin Yun took out the wine previously given to him by Bai Qingyu.

“What are we celebrating?” Bai Qingyu asked.

Lin Yun smiled, “Congratulations on reaching the pinnacle ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.”

Bai Qingyu’s promotion was smoother than his. It might not be a breakthrough, but it wasn’t easy to take that step. She only needed the right opportunity to make a breakthrough in the Quasi-Saint Realm; it was another question to see if she could succeed.

“Okay!” Bai Qignyu nodded.

Lin Yun smiled and poured a cup for everyone, including Lil’ Red.

Several cups later, Bai Qingyu asked, “Big Brother Ye, master told me that your aptitude isn’t even a spiritual physique. Is that true?”

“More or less.” Lin Yun nodded. He wasn’t born with the spiritual physique. The reason why he had a spiritual physique was thanks to Su Ziyao’s Seven Orifice Exquisite Pellet.

“This is too unbelievable,” Bai Qingyu said.

Lin Yun merely smiled as he placed the cup down and smiled, “Talent can only determine how fast you can go, but it doesn’t determine how far you can go. You must rely on your hard work and willingness to see how far you can go. Furthermore, defying the heavens is what swordsman should do, and it has nothing to do with aptitude.”

That was a swordsman. Your journey to defy heaven will become even more dangerous if you have a stronger talent. As a breeze blew past, everyone calmed down.

Lin Yun said, “Let’s head to the ancient altar when we’re done drinking. It’s time for us to search for the Udumbara Flower.”

“Okay,” Bai Qingyu said in excitement. The four of them were excited to see what the legendary Udumbara Flower looked like.

“Someone’s coming. It’s an acquaintance,” Lil’ Purple said before she carried Lil’ Red and disappeared into the Iris Secret Realm.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw a purple figure before them.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Senior Sister Wang!” Bai Qingyu first rejoiced before she was shocked. This person who came was the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, Wang Muyan. The latter hovered in the air and eluded charm throughout her figure.

Since Wang Muyan had a fairly good relationship with Bai Qingyu, she smiled at the latter before looking at Lin Yun, “Ye Qingtian, how are you faring in finding the Udumbara Flower?”

“I believe it has nothing to do with you,” Lin Yun smiled.

Seeing this, Wang Muyan could only turn to look at Bai Qingyu.

If it were in the past, Bai Qingyu would’ve disclosed everything. But she had become smart and smiled, “Senior Sister Wang, what are you doing in the Myriad Graves Valley? Didn’t you say you’re going after the Divine Blood Flower?”

Wang Muyan was surprised by that reply. She was surprised that Bai Qingyu actually had brains for once.
