Chapter 2436 - Come And Fight!

With one arm severed, the Profound Flame Great Saint swiftly got back on his feet. His face was pale, with blood gushing out from his severed arm, and he couldn’t stop it. But his body was filled with boundless vitality, with new flesh growing out from his severed shoulder. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But it was futile because there was a terrifying Bright Sun Sword Intent left on his wound, like blazing flames that stopped him from recovering from his injuries. As a result, the Profound Flame Great Saint couldn’t regenerate his arm. This made the Profound Flame Great Saint on the verge of going insane, and he didn’t dare to charge forth again, since what happened earlier was too terrifying.

The two Great Saints fighting Ye Guhan were deeply shocked. They were in the same cultivation as the Profound Flame Great Saint, and their eyes were filled with fear when they saw Jian Jingtian’s sword intent. The Profound Flame Great Saint was also greatly shocked with disbelief.

The Great Saint was divided into three stages: Divinity, Boundless, and Immortal. The Profound Flame Great Saint might only be a Divinity Stage Great Saint, but he stayed in this stage for at least a few hundred years, which wasn’t something Jian Jingtian could be compared to. But Jian Jingtian easily dealt with the Profound Flame Great Saint, severing an arm of his.

Is this a swordsman? That was the pinnacle of Bright Sun Sword Intent! The Profound Flame Great Saint felt his scalp go numb once he recalled that Mu Xuankong only grasped the pinnacle Divine Light Sword Intent, but Jian Jingtian had grasped the Bright Sun Sword Intent!

He began to panic, unsure if he could withstand Jian Jingtian’s sword intent. He must exhaust his saint origin even if he could reforge his body. But having an undying body didn’t mean that he wouldn’t die, as there were also flaws, such as how Eternal Daos could prevent him from recovering.

At the same time, the Bright Sun Sword Intent also struck him with fear and he wasn’t sure if he could survive that. The longer he lived, the more afraid he became of death. Even if he managed to form an undying physique, he was running out of lifespan and would exhaust his lifespan each time. This wasn’t something he could accept.

The Profound Flame Great Saint’s face was terrifyingly dark, wondering what kind of monster the Radiant Sword Saint’s lineage was.

Jian Jingtian didn’t continue to go after the Profound Flame Great Saint but landed on the Ancient Dracoape’s shoulder.

“Fifth Junior Brother, you’re back!” Mu Chuan had tears rolling down his cheeks, feeling proud of Jian Jingtian. He knew that Jian Jingtian had suffered a lot over the years, especially after Lin Yun arrived in the Kunlun Realm. At that time, Jian Jingtian’s dragon pulses and sword intent accumulated to a terrifying height, and his physique reached its limit. If Jian Jingtian hadn’t made a breakthrough, he would have died from self-detonation.

Jian Jingtian was already prepared to die but finally came out of it.

“Third Senior Brother, let me treat your injuries. We’re the Radiant’s lineage, and no one will die today. We will live well with Master.” Jian Jingtian poured his sword intent into Mu Chuan’s body to get rid of the saint daos left by the Profound Flame Great Saint. Then, he poured his saint energy into Mu Chuan’s body to help him recover.

The Profound Flame Great Saint stabilized himself. He couldn’t regenerate his severed arm with the Bright Sun Sword Intent on his wound, not to mention that the sword intent still caused him great pain.

The Profound Flame Great Saint swung his sword at Jian Jingtian. The latter stopped treating Mu Chuan’s injuries and faced him head-on with a hint of mockery in his eyes.

The Wither Old Man forced Lil’ Purple to retreat and approached the Profound Flame Great Saint, putting his palm on the latter’s shoulder. He used his Death Dao to corrode the sword intent before injecting vitality into the Profound Flame Great Saint’s body through Life Dao, and the two flowers behind him shone brightly.

The Profound Flame Great Saint screamed, but his arm grew back out. The two Great Saints facing Ye Guhan also retreated and heaved a sigh of relief. They were both at the Boundless Stage, one higher than Ye Guhan. But they were under tremendous pressure when they faced him since he had grasped an Eternal Dao and managed to suppress them.

It was hard for Ye Guhan to kill them, and he would lose if they fought for another four hours. Lil’ Purple also retreated to Ye Guhan’s side, and the pressure was alleviated since it was too tough for her to deal with the Wither Old Man alone.

Jian Jingtian jumped off the Ancient Dracoape’s shoulder and smiled, “Senior Brother, it has been a long time since we last met!”

“It has. Why are you so late? The Profound Wither Sea’s sword has long snapped. Where did you go?” Ye Guhan asked.

A chill flashed in Jian Jingtian’s eyes before he said, “Senior Brother, you should know my style.”

“You!” Ye Guhan thought of a possibility and squinted with shock on his face.

Jian Jingtian looked at the four Great Saints before him and said, “Senior Brother, you have guessed it right. I have been waiting outside the Profound Sky Sect and for all the Saints to leave before starting a massacre. Since my sword couldn’t protect everyone from the Sword Sect, they can’t blame me for being ruthless since the Profound Sky Sect sent Saints to kill my Sword Sect’s disciples. I even slaughtered their families and disciples!”

His words made the four Great Saints shiver with a chill. After all, Jian Jingtian was a Great Saint, not to mention that he was a swordsman. So, anyone could imagine how fast it would take to kill everyone in the Profound Sky Sect.

Ye Guhan opened his mouth but said nothing. After all, Jian Jingtian had already gone easy since he only said that he killed the descendants and disciples of the Saints who came to attack the Sword Sect. This meant that he didn’t touch anyone who wasn’t involved. But those who could become a Saint's disciple were the sect's elites, which meant that the Profound Sky Sect was finished.

“Tian Xuanzi left two Saint Sovereigns behind, but they couldn’t even withstand ten swords from me,” Jian Jingtian continued. When his gaze fell onto the four Great Saints before him, he sneered, “It’s a pity that the three holy lands are strictly guarded with Great Saints guarding them. But I will find an opportunity sooner or later. As long as I don’t die, I will make those who slaughter the disciples of my Sword Sect pay the price, regardless of their gender or age! My sword will spare no one!”

“Jian Jingtian, how dare you slaughter the juniors as a righteous swordsman. How are you any different from demonic cultivators?!” The Profound Flame Great Saint roared with his hands trembling when he heard Jian Jingtian visit the three holy lands.

“Hahaha!” Jian Jingtian laughed. “Isn’t the Wither Old Man beside you a famous demonic cultivator? Why don’t you ask how many lives he took cultivating the Wither Saint Canon? Don’t put me on the same level as trash like him. I don’t regret killing anyone with my sword, and I don’t feel guilty for what I’ve done.”

Hearing that, Ye Guhan finally figured out how Jian Jingtian managed to come out of it. At the Ancient Barren Battlefield back then, Tian Xuanzi used tricks to kill the Golden Generation of the Sword Sect, but no one found any evidence against him.

Jian Jingtian was furious because of that and slaughtered over a thousand people from the Profound Sky Sect, thus giving Tian Xuanzi an opportunity. The Radiant Sword Saint wanted to protect Jian Jingtian, thus making him take an oath that he would never leave the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, which became Jian Jingtian’s prison.

It was natural that Jian Jingtian was furious about it since he didn’t feel he had done anything wrong, and Ye Guhan wasn’t surprised by what he had done.

Ye Guhan said with heartache, “You will have to bear the sins if you slaughter the juniors.”

He didn’t care about the lives of those people, but he was feeling heartache that Jian Jingtian would have to bear the sins because of it. This was why the Wither Old Man couldn’t find an opportunity to reach the Emperor Realm. If the Wither Old Man dared to undergo his Emperor Tribulation, there was no doubt that he would die.

Jian Jingtian coldly said, “I will bear all the sins, and this is how a swordsman should be. We won’t regret the decisions we’ve made.”

The four opposing Great Saints felt a chill down their spines with a hint of regret. They knew the three holy lands would have no peace if they couldn’t kill Jian Jingtian today. The Profound Flame Great Saint gritted his teeth, “Kill him! The Radiant Sword Saint has to die, and he also has to die!”

“Let’s go!” Everyone changed their strategy. The Wither Old Man would face Jian Jingtian, Ye Guhan would deal with the two Ming Cult’s Great Saints, and Lil’ Purple would face the Profound Flame Great Saint. Their new strategy had some effect because the Wither Old Man was suppressing Jian Jingtian.

On the Sword Sect’s seven main peaks, battles between Great Saints were everywhere, and the battle on each peak was intense. Mu Xuankong joined hands with the Azure Python Great Saint and managed to obtain an advantage in the fight, trapping the four strongest Great Saints from the Profound Sky Sect’s faction.

Divine Firmament Peak gained the advantage in the fight. At the same time, the Serene Dust Great Saint and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint were protecting Golden Firmament Peak, stabilizing the situation. But things didn’t look good on Indigo Firmament Peak. The Dragon Origin Great Saint had to face four Great Saints alone.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint had to face the Ghost Shadow Great Saint of Black Mountain, who was proficient in using poison. The Great Saint from the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion was soon heavily injured and could no longer put up a fight.

Ultimately, the Dragon Origin Great Saint could only bear everything, protecting the Indigo Firmament Peak with his life on the line.

The other main peaks were also in a dangerous situation as they had no advantage in their numbers. As for the hundred and eight peaks, the situation was even more terrible, with over seventy peaks being destroyed and all the disciples and deacons gathered on Heaven Prolong Peak, and the pressure was gradually increasing on Ye Ziling’s side.

“Mu Xuankong, do you think that I don’t have any temper?” A roar echoed in the Sword Sect that came from the Ming Cult’s Light Subduing Great Saint. The four of them were trapped by the Azure Dragon, with Mu Xuankong relying on the earth energy.

The Light Subduing Great Saint became furious and finally used the Sovereign Saint Artifact, the Sun-Moon Saint Cloth. He also brought out his Sovereign Constellation with a dao flower representing an Eternal Dao appearing behind him. It was the Yin-Yang Dao of the nine Eternal Daos combined with the Great Solar and Great Lunar Daos.

With his attack empowered by an Eternal Dao, he easily separated the Azure Dragon and Mu Xuankong with one attack, breaking apart the encirclement.

The seven main and outer peaks began to tremble violently under this attack, with everyone shocked. After all, no one expected the Light Subduing Great Saint to grasp Yin-Yang Dao as well as the Great Solar and Great Lunar Daos. It was no wonder that Tian Xuanzi gave him the Imperial Dragon Order to take charge of the battle.

“Hmph, even the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t dare to be so arrogant when we fought in the past. So, where did a junior like you get your confidence from?!” The Light Subduing Great Saint was enraged. He took out the Imperial Dragon Order and roared, “Divine Dragon, aid me!”

The Imperial Dragon Order flew out and a Golden-Purple Divine Dragon appeared, suppressing the aura of the Azure Dragon. With just three moves, he knocked Mu Xuankong down from the air.

“Sect Master!” All the Sword Sect’s disciples became anxious.

“Die!” The Light Subduing Great Saint descended from the sky, wanting to take Mu Xuankong’s life through this opportunity. The three other Great Saints simultaneously moved out, surrounding Mu Xuankong.

A demonic aura swept out and a massive Heavenly Wolf’s figure appeared in the sky. A mysterious hooded man, taking this attack head-on, appeared before the Light Subduing Great Saint. This hooded man also had a flower representing an Eternal Dao behind him, the Primal Chaos Dao. Aside from that, a woman arrived to help Mu Xuankong deal with the attacks from the three Great Saints.

“Feng Yu!” Mu Xuankong was shocked when he saw the newcomer.

This person was the Radiant Sword Saint’s second disciple, Feng Yu. She smiled, “Senior Brother Mu, it has been a long time.”

As she spoke, a sword ray vibrated that came from Jian Jingtian. He released his Bright Sun Sword Intent, catching the incoming three Great Saints by surprise and forcing them back.

“Fifth Junior Brother!” Feng Yu rejoiced when she saw Jian Jingtian. She said, “You finally draw your sword.”

Jian Jingtian looked at the mysterious Great Saint facing the Light Subduing Great Saint. He smiled, “Second Senior Sister’s eyesight is pretty good. I don’t know if our master will accept this husband of yours, but I have accepted him.”

Feng Yu smiled and rejoiced at what Jian Jingtian said. She said, “I like what you just said.”

With that, all the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciples were gathered in the Sword Sect, aside from Lin Yun.

Jian Jingtian looked at Mu Xuankong, and cupped his fists together, “Sect Master, if possible, I would like the temporary ownership of the Saint Sword and Greater Heaven Authority Order.”

“My honor!” Mu Xuankong handed the Greater Heaven Authority Order and the Saint Sword representing the Sword Sect over to Jian Jingtian.

When Jian Jingtian held onto them, the Great Profound Sword Array opened up again with eight swords behind him, not seven. A powerful sword intent and saint energy burst from where the Grand Firmament Peak once stood.

When Jian Jingtian raised the Saint Sword, the Great Profound Sword Array that was initially collapsing recovered, instantly alleviating everyone’s pressure. Jian Jingtian was fearless as he looked at the three Great Saints before him with fighting spirits blazing in his eyes. He roared, “Come!”
