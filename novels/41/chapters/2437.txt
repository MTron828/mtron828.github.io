Chapter 2438 - Waking Up From A Dream

“It’s as I’ve surmised...” The Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master looked at Lin Yun, and said, “Come with me.”

She soared to the sky with Lin Yun and Mu Xueling following after her. The Flower Burial Sword then stabbed into a mountain. This surprised Mu Xueling because this was the Myriad Grave Valley of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain where the graves of Emperors were stored.

“This is the Myriad Grave Valley,” Mu Xueling explained.

Hearing what she said, Lin Yun’s face changed. He asked, “The Myriad Grave Valley? The Southern Emperor’s tomb is in the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain?”

“You’ll know when you go down,” the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master said. This was a spacious valley without any eeriness in the surroundings.

When Lin Yun descended, he couldn’t sense any chilling aura from the surroundings but a warmth instead.

Mu Xueling said, “Everyone buried here was an Emperor, and their will still exists, even after death. They’re also spirits protecting the human race.”

As they approached the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun instantly understood what was happening. When Lin Yun saw the name on the grave, he squinted. It was written: Southern Emperor and his lover rest here

His heart clenched as he thought of the love story between them.

He heaved a sigh of relief and performed three kowtows at the grave to express his respect. After all, the Flower Burial Sword helped him immensely along the way. Regardless of the Southern Emperor or his wife, there was a connection between them through the sword.

“This makes sense now. How can the Southern Emperor’s tomb exist alone? Based on his affection for his wife, the two should be buried together,” Lin Yun said. It could be considered a good ending for them to be buried together.

“Where do the flowers bloom? Where do I come from? The endless mountain and lake; the crisping leaves and wind! Drifting flowers like dreams, and sorrow like fine rain! No one possesses everything in this world, and I shall give the lord a white lily!”

Lin Yun looked at the poem on the monument with sorrow.

Mu Xueling said, “The tomb outside is just an empty tomb of the Southern Emperor.”

She roughly knew about the famous Southern Emperor’s tomb outside.

“That’s a fake. The real treasures of the Southern Emperor are the Heavenly Dragon Bone, Hell Painting, and Heavenly Fate Talisman. They’re all kept by the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain,” the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master said. She continued, “Under his instructions, the treasures can be given to those who come with the sword of his wife.”

That meant the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain could also not give the treasures to just anyone. This was a failsafe set up by the Southern Emperor. Not only did the heir have to receive his acknowledgment, but the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain’s acknowledgment as well.

“If I want to reforge the Heavenly Path and get rid of the Demonspirit Clan’s deities, I will need the help of the Heavenly Dragon Bone,” Lin Yun said, looking at the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. After creating the Heavenly Dragon Sword and grasping the Heavenly Dragon’s authority, he knew how powerful a Heavenly Dragon was. The Heavenly Dragon was ranked above the seven divine dragons, as well as the Sovereign Constellation, the Azure Dragon Constellation.

The value of the Heavenly Dragon Bone was unimaginable and could help Lin Yun close up the distance in his cultivation.

The Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master said, “You will have to bear the karma of the Heavenly Dragon Bone, and there’s no reason for the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain not to give it to you. The Southern Emperor was focused on reviving his wife, but it was too late when he came to his senses. His lifespan ended, and he couldn’t reforge the Heavenly Path anymore. He tasked the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain to see if the successor could bear that karma. Even if we give you the Heavenly Dragon Bone, it will bring more cons and pros.”

“You want to test my strength? Any time,” Lin Yun said, looking at the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master with confidence in his eyes.

“Please.” The Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master threw a punch over, and Lin Yun faced it head-on. When the two punches clashed, saint music began to appear in the surroundings as two dao flowers representing Eternal Daos appeared behind Lin Yun.

On the other hand, the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master had no phenomenon or saint energy fluctuation.

When the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master stopped, Lin Yun was surprised before he pulled back his strength, forcing him to take three steps back before stabilizing himself. Due to the tremendous boost in strength at the Azure Sky Realm, Lin Yun still hadn’t gained complete control of his strength yet.

“As expected of the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master.” Lin Yun cupped his fists together. He finally knew how deep and unfathomable the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master was. She was probably on the same level as the Nine Emperors.

The Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master said, “The Southern Emperor cannot be compared to you when he was of the same age, and I believe he’d be willing to give you the Heavenly Dragon Bone even if he’s alive.”

Lin Yun said nothing as he looked at the Flower Burial Sword. With a wave of his hand, the Flower Burial Sword returned to his heart.

“Come with me,” the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master said and brought the two to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Palace. In accordance with the Iris Sword Saint’s instructions, she handed the Nirvana Divine Rune to Lin Yun.

The Nirvana Divine Rune was engraved on a painting, and Lin Yun received the entire painting. He could sense the fluctuation of the Nirvana Divine Rune when he held onto it. He used his Nirvana Dao to sense it before the seal on the painting loosened up with a massive power gushing out from the Nirvana Divine Rune, which he quickly stopped.

The Nirvana Divine Rune was the most important amongst the Seven Sovereign Divine Runes, but now wasn’t the time for him to refine it.

“Here’s the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.” Mu Xueling came out from the back of the palace and handed an umbrella to Lin Yun. She continued, “Not only was the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella completely reforged, but the holy master even refined nine dragon souls into it. It’s stronger than before now.”

“Thank you, Holy Master!” Lin Yun rejoiced. The Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella was a Sovereign Saint Artifact he used the most. Now that he had become stronger than before, this Sovereign Saint Artifact became a perfect match for him with high compatibility. Even the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear couldn’t be compared to it in terms of compatibility. So, the umbrella in his hand could significantly boost his strength.

“I wonder if the holy master knows where the Samsara Divine Rune is?” Lin Yun asked. He was only left with the Samsara Divine Rune and Freezing Chill Divine Rune of the Seven Sovereign Divine Runes. The Freezing Chill Divine Rune was located in the Frostsnow Sacred Palace. But he had no clues about the Samsara Divine rune. If he couldn’t gather all seven Sovereign Divine Runes, the Iris Sword Box would be incomplete and couldn’t surpass the Firmament Saint Cloth.

The Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master said, “The Black-White Palace, owned by the Black and White Emperors.”

Lin Yun frowned since the Black and White Emperors were among the Nine Emperors, even stronger than the Ice Emperor. Not to mention that there were two of them. He knew that it would be troublesome for him to retrieve it.

“What about the Heavenly Dragon Bone?” Lin Yun asked.

“So far, yet so close.” The Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master said as she undid a seal and a dragon’s roar echoed within the palace along with a golden radiance. A terrifying dragon’s aura descended, forcing Lin Yun and Mu Xueling down onto their knees.

It was a long spine reaching over a thousand meters that gave off a golden radiance and powerful aura that was comparable to a divine artifact. As the spine descended, the aura it gave off increased so much that Mu Xueling couldn’t bear the pressure, with blood dripping down from her lips, and her face became pale.

Lin Yun circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon and slowly got back on his feet. A Heavenly Dragon’s aura also swept out from his body, resisting the pressure. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master had satisfaction on her face before she grabbed the Heavenly Dragon Spine and it began to shrink in size. With a flick, the Heavenly Dragon Bone fell into Lin Yun’s hand.

The Heavenly Dragon Bone felt burning as it burrowed into his body, fusing with his right arm, looking like a metallic glove and armguard. It had fused with him, but not entirely.

“I have sealed the Heavenly Dragon Bone into your right arm for now, but it won’t last long. You have to refine it quickly,” the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master said. “Once you’ve refined it, you will receive boundless benefits and bear the fate of reforging the Heavenly Path.”

Lin Yun looked at his right arm, nodding, “I will do my best.”

“This is the Heavenly Fate Talisman. You might not need it, but I’ll give it to you. This is a divine artifact bearing the fortune of the entire Kunlun Realm, which the Divine Dragon Empire has been wanting,” the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master said. She continued, “You can use it yourself, give it to someone else, or hide it. It’s your choice to decide.”

Lin Yun wore a grave expression and finally knew how vital this item was. This talisman was the key if someone wanted to rule the entire Kunlun Realm and establish an immortal empire. This talisman was even more critical than the Heavenly Dragon Bone to ambitious people.

“Mu Xueling, send him out,” the Heavenly Fragrance Holy Master said before she left.

As Lin Yun and Mu Xueling walked out of the Heavenly Fragrance divine Mountain, they chatted and could see many disciples along the way. They would either be playing music, fishing, or playing chess. But they shared something in common; they all had a high cultivation. But each of them didn’t look ambitious at all.

“If the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain was willing to get involved in the Kunlun Realm’s affairs, even the Nine Emperors might not be able to stop you guys, right?” Lin Yun asked.

“We’re a bunch of wanderers. Back then, the holy master had some relationship with the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity and stayed in the Kunlun Realm. Our home isn’t the Kunlun Realm, so we’ve been wandering,” Mu Xueling smiled. She continued, “If you can’t reforge the Heavenly Path, we will wander again to seek a place to stay.”

“Why is that?” Lin Yun asked.

“The holy master already calculated that the Kunlun Realm will have a crisis within the next hundred years unless the Heavenly Path is reforged,” Mu Xueling said.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed, knowing that what Mu Xueling said was true.

“The holy master might not get involved in the Kunlun Realm’s affairs, but she doesn’t like the Empress’ style. According to her way, it would bring a great disaster to the nine domains even if she manages to become a deity,” Mu Xueline said. “So you have to live well.”

“What do you mean? The disaster doesn’t come from the Demonspirit Clan?” Lin Yun asked.

“That depends on how you understand it. Are the lives of ants considered lives? If they’re considered lives, it can be considered a disaster,” Mu Xueling replied.

Lin Yun remembered what Mu Xueling said. When he was about to leave, he couldn’t help turning around to take a look when he sensed an unusual fragrance. The fragrance came from a towering tree with blooming flowers and some fruits.

Those fruits gave off a faint radiance that looked like infants inside.

“That’s the ranked first fragrance in the world, the Dream Butterfly Flower. If someone wakes up from the dream, they will emerge from those fruits. Many people in the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain came from the fruits,” Mu Xueling said.

Lin Yun was stumped before he smiled, not believing what she said. He cupped his fists together, “Goodbye. I don’t know if we can meet again, but I’m grateful for you taking care of me!”

Mu Xueling’s heart sank when she heard what Lin Yun said because she never considered the possibility that he would die. But thinking that he might die, she became at a loss and could no longer control her thoughts. After a long time later, she made up her mind and summoned an Azure Bird.
