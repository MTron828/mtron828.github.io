Chapter 846 - You and I

Letting out a sigh, Lin Yun noticed that his body felt a lot more polished and relaxed. The Azure Firmament Sword Sutra was like a key that opened a new door for him, a path towards the genuine immortal sword path.

“Jian Wuya…I really have to thank this senior.” Lin Yun stood up and the azure dragon behind him dissipated. Along with it, his terrifying sword aura also disappeared. When he took a look around, nothing seemed to have changed from when he entered the Dragoncloud Treasury.

“I want to look for Yue Weiwei first.” Lin Yun was still worried about Yue Weiwei. When he came out of the valley, he almost immediately discovered a bolt of lightning streaking across the horizon. Zhao Wuji had just left a cave when he discovered Lin Yun looking around.

Zhao Wuji was enveloped in lightning with misty clouds that shrouded him. When Zhao Wuji looked at Lin Yun, he was briefly stunned before his eyes flashed with disdain. He had obtained a lesser fortune martial technique on the mountain. It was a cultivation technique that strengthened his cloud intent.

He actually obtained a complete fortune martial technique. In the Ancient Southern Domain, even the Indigomoon Elysium didn’t dare to claim that they had a complete fortune martial technique. If news of his lesser fortune martial technique gots out, it would surely cause a huge shock in the Ancient Southern Domain. At this moment, he was confident that Lin Yun didn’t even know what a fortune martial technique was.

Thinking about it, the disdain in his pupils grew even denser. He couldn’t believe that as one of the three kings, he actually lost to someone like Lin Yun. So when he saw that there was no change in Lin Yun’s aura, he became a lot more confident.

In a flash, he appeared before Lin Yun and spoke with a playful smile, “Everyone is equal in the Dragoncloud Treasury. The fact that you’ve gotten nothing so far is enough to prove my words.”

“Are you that certain that I got nothing?” asked Lin Yun with a bizarre expression.

“Did you?” Zhao Wuji sneered, “The opportunities here aren't like other places. Without comprehension, everything is futile. Then again, someone like you wouldn’t understand what I’m saying…”

His pupils flickered with killing aura as he began to hesitate if he should teach Lin Yun a lesson right now. With the boost in his strength, Zhao Wuji was confident that his thundercloud intent could deal with Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent. As long as Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent didn’t suppress him, Lin Yun would just be a piece of trash.

“Have fun searching around. I won’t stay here any longer. The treasury will be closing soon and you’re destined to return empty handed,” smiled Zhao Wuji before he chose to wait. Defeating Lin Yun with no one around wasn’t any fun.

Zhao Wuji planned to humiliate Lin Yun when there were people around. He wanted everyone to see that the champion of the banquet was a joke.

“What an idiot,” muttered Lin Yun. He could sense that Zhao Wuji wanted to attack him earlier, but it was a shame that the latter gave up on that idea.

Not long after Zhao Wuji left, a domineering aura surged from a plain far away as Yu Haotian soared into the sky. Yu Haotian’s actions caused many people to notice him.

Yu Haotian swept his glance at Lin Yun from afar and sneered. He had made a breakthrough with the lesser fortune martial technique he obtained and strengthened his Overlord Fist. He was at least one-fold stronger than before.

“I can’t wait to see you die later,” said Yu Haotian before he retracted his gaze and left the mountain. One by one, the phenomena in the surroundings began to collapse. Everyone could sense that the treasury was about to disappear.

Those who were still comprehending techniques on the mountain had appeared. While searching for Yue Weiwei, Lin Yun also ran into Jiang Ziye, Mu Han, Nangong Wanyu, Wu Xiaotian, Zhu Qingshan, and the other top ten. All of them had a pretty good harvest on the mountain. Then again, their harvest was nothing compared to Lin Yun.

Even if he didn’t obtain two greater fortune martial techniques, he would still have a greater harvest because of his sword comprehension. His sword comprehension surpassed all the swordsmen in the Profound Amber Realm, even the ones that lived for hundreds of years. There were tens of thousands of dao in the world, but only immortality would last forever.

Lin Yun frowned because he still couldn’t find Yue Weiwei anywhere. As the sky in the treasury began to collapse, everyone headed towards the exit.

“Where is she?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. Did Yue Weiwei already leave? It didn’t seem possible because everyone else had a harvest here. It made no sense that Yue Weiwei didn’t get anything.

“Lin Yun, you’re still here? This place is collapsing…” Bai Lixuan also stopped his comprehension and arrived next to Lin Yun.

“Did you see Yue Weiwei around?” Lin Yun asked.

“I didn’t see her on the mountain…” Bai Lixuan paused briefly before he continued, “I saw a dragon flying away after you entered the core region. She chased after it, but I’m not too certain about what happened.”

Lin Yun knew that it was definitely Yue Weiwei. He quickly responded to Bai Lixuan, “You should leave first. I’m going to take another look around.”

“Be careful,” said Bai Lixuan before he turned around and left.

After Bai Lixuan left, Lin Yun continued his search in the treasury. It didn’t take long for the entire treasury to collapse. Aside from the mountain Lin Yun was at, all the other mountains began to crumble with countless treasures getting sucked into the mysterious vortex in the sky. The vortex looked like the mouth of a dragon, which was kind of strange.

But Lin Yun didn’t think too much about it. He was only concerned about Yue Weiwei. He was confident that she must’ve chased after the Indigoflame Thunderwhip that belonged to him. Others might not have seen what happened in the core region, but not Yue Weiwei.

As Lin Yun continued to search, he suddenly heard the sound of a flute. The song was filled with sorrow, which instantly attracted Lin Yun’s attention. “It’s her!”

Lin Yun previously felt that the top of the mountain was a forbidden ground and that his efforts to go there would be futile. However, he could tell that Yue Weiwei’s music came from the top.

He instantly tossed all his hesitation aside and pushed his movement technique to the limit. Charging towards the top of the mountain, he felt immense pressure. It was so bad that he had to bring out his Azure Firmament Tree and wrap himself in a tornado.

“Go!” Lin Yun barked. The tornado carried him up into the sky, helping him move a lot faster than before. It didn’t take long for him to arrive at the top of the mountain.

Yue Weiwei was donned in her red dress on the platform at the top of the mountain. She was playing her flute in front of a colossal dragon shrouded in purple lightning and flames. The dragon was only a skeleton, but it was engraved with divine runes that were mysterious, golden, and ancient.

Perhaps it was because of the divine runes, but the lightning and flames looked like they could incinerate everything. The dragon was extremely sinister as it emitted the pressure or a dao artifact that even a Heavenly Soul Realm expert would be fearful of.

At this moment, the dragon was struggling painfully under the flute music and roared incessantly. Yue Weiwei wore a rare grave expression, which made her look even more demonic than usual. She also had beads of sweat dripping down from her forehead. Clearly, she was only barely able to suppress this dao artifact.

When the tornado tore the clouds apart, it created an earth-shattering commotion. Yue Weiwei’s heart throbbed as she turned to look at the sound. Due to this distraction, the dragon had an opportunity to break free. With a violent roar, Yue Weiwei’s flute was disrupted and she suffered a backlash. Although her face turned pale, the dragon charged towards her to harm her even more. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Get lost!” Veins popped out on Lin Yun’s forehead as he became angry. At this moment, he unleashed his Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Aura. A terrifying sword aura emitted out from him with purple sword rays shooting out of his pores. A thirty meters long azure dragon appeared behind him with a pair of dragon eyes that flickered like stars.

As his sword aura tore apart the clouds, Lin Yun clenched his fist and threw a punch out. His punch caused the entire mountain to tremble violently. At the same time, the purple dragon was also knocked backwards.

As sparks flew, the dragon was destroyed and the Indigoflame Thunderwhip fell onto the ground. However, Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with the whip right now and helped Yue Weiwei up.

“I knew you’d come for me even if everyone left.” Yue Weiwei revealed a smile on her pale face. Initially, Lin Yun wanted to scold her, but he decided to shut up.

“Don’t be so silly in the future,” said Lin Yun coldly.

“No way!” Yue Weiwei said stubbornly with her pale face.

“I’ll be worried about you,” replied Lin Yun seriously.

When Yue Weiwei heard that, her expression loosened up and she smiled, “Then I will give it some consideration.”

I don’t want to hide my worries from her, but what’s with her reply? Lin Yun was genuinely concerned for her. After all, he would be sad if anything happened to her.

Yue Weiwei peeked at Lin Yun carefully and smiled, “Big Brother Yun, pick up that dao artifact. I’ll listen to you in the future.”

Lin Yun walked over and picked up the Indigoflame Thunderwhip that had been promoted to a dao artifact. He realized that he couldn’t control it at all even with the great boost in his strength.

“Let’s go,” said Lin Yun after storing the Indigoflame Thunderwhip with great difficulty. Then, grabbing hold of Yue Weiwei’s hand, he jumped off the mountain peak. When Yue Weiwei turned around, the entire world was collapsing, so she tightened her grip on Lin Yun’s hand.
