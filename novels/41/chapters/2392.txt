Chapter 2393 - Slapping Faces Ruthlessly

This meant Lin Yun was only one step from reaching the pinnacle of Saint Lord, the ninth-stage Saint Lord. But if he didn’t have any opportunities, it would take a long time for that breakthrough. After all, Lin Yun was only twenty-seven this year, unlike those who were in their fifties or close to a hundred who had accumulated their cultivation over time.

But it was fortunate that Lin Yun had a lot of trump cards. He had two Eternal Daos, two Sovereign Constellations, unrivalled talent in the sword, and the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon reaching the eleventh stage.

He blew the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute for an entire night before stopping when the day came. His sword intent was stuck at Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent for a long time, and he could sense that the bottleneck had loosened up after his breakthrough on the sword canon. He wanted to rely on music to make a breakthrough, but he was just one step away.

“What a pity...” Lin Jiangxian said as she stood on the roof, watching him the entire night. She could see Lin Yun being enveloped by a Heavenly Dragon and a Divine Phoenix, with his sword intent shining brightly like a sun.

When dawn came, she couldn’t tell if Lin Yun had made a breakthrough, but it was a pity he couldn’t do it. Even so, she could tell that Lin Yun could reach the Bright Sun Sword Intent at any time.

Not long later, Ji Zixi, Yue Weiwei, and everyone else came out and headed to the Heavenly Saint Courtyard. There were only two hundred people participating today, and the scene wasn’t as grand as yesterday. But everyone knew the two hundred who remained were true geniuses, and they have grasped many trump cards.

When Lin Yun’s group arrived, the other geniuses were waiting. When Luo Tianxi arrived, the atmosphere became heated.

Luo Tianxi looked at Profound Sky Venerable, who nodded, “Let’s begin.”

The deacons on the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage began making preparations and took out jade slips with names engraved on them, dividing them into groups.

Profound Sky Venerable said, “The rules today will be different. This round, we will determine the top thirty. These thirty will be able to leave their names on the Heavenly Barren Monument and receive heavenly dao fortune from the ancestral deity. You guys will be divided into six groups, meaning each group will only have five spots.”

Lin Yun quickly understood the rules, and the two hundred people were swiftly divided into six groups. Lin Jiangxian and Ji Zixi were in the first group, and they were fortunate as they could take care of each other, which meant that they had a higher chance of making it into the top thirty.

When the battle began, everyone finally saw a high-intensity fight. There was no room for seventh-stage Saint Lords here since the ninth-stage Saint Lords were using their cultivation to suppress everyone. At this moment, everyone finally understood how terrifying ninth-stage Saint Lords were. Their auras and constellations combined, and it looked as though the entire sky was being dragged down when they waved their hands. This was an unbelievable scene.

But that wasn’t all, as they even fused their auras with daos to form domains, easily defeating seventh-stage Saint Lords. In just a few breaths, half of the people on stage were gone.

Lin Yun frowned with concern flashing across his eyes. He wasn’t worried about Lin Jiangxian but Ji Zixi because he couldn’t see through her cultivation. So, her bloodline might not withstand the power of a ninth-stage Saint Lord.

“No need to worry about her,” Yue Weiwei winked, seeing through Lin Yun’s concerns.

Lin Yun smiled and chose to believe in her. Facing a ninth-stage Saint Lord, a divine seal bloomed on Ji Zixi’s forehead as a divine phoenix descended from the sky, withstanding the aura from the ninth-stage Saint Lord.

Lin Jiangxian also heaved a sighin relief when she saw this scene, as she couldn’t afford to be distracted in this fight. Ultimately, Lin Jiangxian and Ji Zixi bore the pressure and successfully emerged. This was shocking because if they were lucky yesterday, there was no luck today.

“Lin Yun’s women were promoted again!”

“They’re in the top thirty now, and they can leave their names on the Heavenly Barren Monument. Isn't the ninth testing ground the weakest?”

“This is unbelievable!” Amidst the discussions, the second group’s fight was about to begin, and Yue Weiwei’s name was called. She instantly became the center of attention when she stood out.

“Yue Weiwei can probably make it through. She made it through the testing ground herself, and her foundation is only stronger than the other two.”

“But it’s a pity that such a beauty chose Lin Yun.”

“What if the women made it through, but Lin Yun couldn’t?”

Yue Weiwei smoothly made it to the next round and returned to Lin Yun’s side.

“You’re the only one left, Big Brother Lin,” Yue Weiwei smiled.

Lin Yun nodded calmly. When his name was called out for the third round, there were many formidable foes in this round, including were Di Feng, a Qilin Mountain’s swordsman, and other testing ground geniuses.

When Lin Yun went on the stage, he instantly felt the surrounding hostility as all the swordsmen looked at him with hostility. Those from the Qilin Mountain even looked at him with murderous intent flashing in their eyes. As for Di Feng, Lin Yun had already formed a grudge against the Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf Clan during the ninth testing ground.

“Without Yue Weiwei, who can you depend on this time?” The Qilin Mountain’s swordsman smiled.

Lin Yun raised his head, and smiled, “You are the Qilin Mountain’s disciple? Let me experience your strength, if there’s an opportunity.”

His smile left many people baffled. But the blue-clothed swordsman from Qilin Mountain said, “There’s no need for Qilin Sword Immortal’s disciples to move against you.”

Lin Yun was disappointed upon hearing that. This group only had forty people, and they were the strongest with practically everyone being a ninth-stage Saint Lord. Many people exchanged gazes before they looked at Lin Yun, planning to join hands to deal with him.

Many people paid attention to this round since Luo Tianxi said that Lin Yun was a peerless prodigy swordsman. So, everyone wanted to see how strong Lin Yun was.

When Profound Sky Venerable announced the beginning, half of the people charged at Lin Yun with their auras and attacks released. This was an unbelievable scene as Lin Yun was completely enveloped by their aura.

“Aren’t you a peerless prodigy swordsman? Draw your sword, and let us see your strength!” Di Feng roared.

“You want me to make a move that much?” Lin Yun smiled, but he didn’t want to draw his sword upon seeing this. He took out the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and planned to try to grasp the Bright Sun Sword Intent. He wanted to use music to wield his sword to break the bottleneck of the Bright Sun Sword Intent.

A Heavenly Dragon and a Divine Phoenix flew out, coiling around Lin Yun. When the Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix released their auras, Lin Yun’s sword intent began to rise.

“That fellow...” Lin Jiangxian instantly knew what Lin Yun was trying to do, and she could only say that Lin Yun was bold. Then again, it made sense since it was an excellent opportunity to make a breakthrough under tremendous pressure. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

When the battle unfolded, a bizarre scene occurred. Lin Yun didn’t use his sword, but it felt like swords were everywhere, with his sword intent bearing the ninth-stage Saint Lords’ pressure. All of their attacks were resolved by the Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix, unable to get close to Lin Yun.

This left everyone dumbfounded. They thought Lin Yun wanted to play the Ni Chang Dress Song. They didn’t expect Lin Yun to have such high attainment in music, and many people felt as though they were in a grand world with a bright sun at the center of this world under the music. The sun released a dazzling radiance that made everyone shut their eyes, and they couldn’t see Lin Yun.

Lin Yun had forgotten everything as he focused on playing the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, sensing the Dragon-Phoenix Score. The incoming attacks were terrifying, but Lin Yun closed his eyes with his clothes fluttering as he played the flute, using the Dragon-Phoenix Score to wield his sword and attract everyone’s attention.

Finally, someone couldn’t hold it any longer and used their trump cards, creating various phenomena on the stage with the aura they gave off, making the stage tremble. In that split second, the flute music, sword vibration, dragon’s roar, and phoenix’s cry became quiet.

This was a terrifying scene, but it made Lin Yun excited instead. He opened his eyes and gradually approached the incoming attacks. When he took nine steps forth, the suppressed flute music exploded with his hair fluttering violently. The Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix began to fuse and became a massive cauldron that enveloped Lin Yun.

When all the attacks landed on the cauldron, they dissipated as the cauldron stood firmly without a crack. This scene left everyone who was ganging up on Lin Yun dumbfounded.

Lin Yun laughed as the cauldron opened up, and he reappeared once more before everyone. His flute music was like a tidal wave that swept out, making multiple geniuses on the stage throw out blood with their faces becoming pale. It wasn’t long before Di Feng and the Qilin Mountain’s swordsman were the only ones left on the stage.

Lin Yun smiled, “The Qilin Mountain’s swordsman is rather impressive. Perhaps I should consider taking the Qilin Sword Immortal as my master or become Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s servant.”

When he said that, the Qilin Mountain’s swordsman threw out a mouthful of blood and fell onto one knee with his face pale. Everyone knew Lin Yun said that on purpose, and he was already so strong without using his sword. So why would he take the Qilin Sword Immortal as his master? This made the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s words a laughingstock.
