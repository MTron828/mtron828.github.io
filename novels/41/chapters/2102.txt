Chapter 2103: Holy Maiden Killer

“What use does the Golden Lotus Flametree have?” Lin Yun asked. This was his first time hearing about it.

“It’s a Buddhist cult’s saint tree. It was long extinct but it reappeared within an old Buddhist Sect’s location. The golden lotuses on the tree can repair any injuries on the physique. Aside from that, there’s also a certain chance of entering the Golden Lotus Secret Realm to comprehend martial techniques. So don’t go back on your promise. The Golden Lotus Flametree can repair the injuries you suffered when you failed in your breakthrough to the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. That way you can make a breakthrough to the Quasi-Saint Realm,” Bai Qingyu said, nervously looking at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned upon hearing that. Bai Qingyu must’ve been under the impression that he couldn’t make a breakthrough to the Quasi-Saint Realm because of his ‘injuries’ when he failed to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. But in fact, he didn’t fail but decided to give up at the last moment.

However, everyone knew about it, including the Blood Moon Divine Maiden, so Bai Qingyu must’ve waited so long for him because of that concern. This naturally touched Lin Yun’s heart, so he decided to go to the Golden Lotus Flametree. He smiled, “I’m already alright now.”

“Hmph, I don’t believe you. I’ve already reached the Quasi-Saint Realm, and you’re still at the Nirvana Stage. If you’re fine, you would’ve long made a breakthrough to the Quasi-Saint Realm within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda,” Bai Qingyu said as he pulled Lin Yun over to the Dao Yang Palace.

This made Lin Yun bitterly smile, but there was no way he could explain this. He was now at the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and the difficulty to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm far exceeded what it was before. But if he made a breakthrough, his strength would be greatly boosted because his foundation had become stronger.

Lin Yun reckoned that even the Golden Lotus Flametree couldn’t help him make a breakthrough to the Quasi-Saint Realm. However, it would be useful to reforge his physique. After all, his physique had experienced ten-odd years within the Three-Lives Realm, and if he could reforge his physique, he would have no concern about entering the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda before the Quasi-Saint Realm.

The two came to the Dao Yang Palace before they learned that Bai Yunfeng had already left the Heavenly Dao Sect three days ago.

Bai Qingyu smiled, “It’s fine. I know the location, so you can come with me.”

“Where are we going?”

“Fleeting Sky Mountain. It used to be where the Buddhist cult’s holy land, the Fleeting Sky Monastery, was located. It is in ruins now, but I know where it is.” When Lin Yun and Bai Qingyu left the sect, they rode their horses and sped towards Fleeting Sky Mountain.

The two horses possessed the bloodline of divine dragons, and they would travel without rest. Furthermore, their speed wasn’t inferior to a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase. In less than a day, they arrived at Fleeting Sky Mountain.

Fleeting Sky Mountain was a massive mountain range reaching thousands of feet. The ruins of the Fleeting Sky Monastery were located at the bottom of the cliff, and they had to walk down a special trail from the top of the mountain.

Below the cliff was a flow of boiling magma. They followed along the magma river, entered the mountain range, and came to a man-made cave. There were incomplete Buddhist paintings and statues within the cave. Inside the cliff was a massive empty cave, with more than a hundred stone pillars supporting the entire cave, as well as many statues. The cave was spacious and could accommodate tens of thousands of people.

But the entrance was crowded, filled with cultivators from the Eastern Desolation and other domains. All of them were cultivators from other holy lands, and they were all prideful. They wanted to enter the cave, but they were stopped outside. The Eastern Desolation’s six holy lands have joined forces to seal off this place, forbidding cultivators from other domains to enter.

“The Eastern Desolation’s holy lands are domineering. The Golden Lotus Flametree is inside, but they don’t allow us to enter.”

“They’re clearly bullying us because we’re from other domains.”

“They won’t be able to maintain their dominance for long. I don’t believe that the six holy lands can do what they want!” The cultivators outside were furious but didn’t dare to charge in. The six holy lands clearly came prepared. Not only did they have the advantage in numbers, but also in location. Thus, they would greatly suffer if they tried to forcefully break in.

“So many people,” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked when he saw this scene. It looked like Bai Qingyu was right. The Eastern Desolation had plunged into chaos with the appearance of the Blue Dragon Record. In the past, the six holy lands wouldn’t be so united and even competed with each other, but they joined forces.

“Hold it right there!” When Lin Yun and Bai Qingyu stepped forth, someone soon stopped them.

“No need to stop them. They’re on our side. He’s Ye Qingtian, and that girl is the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden’s younger sister.”

“So, he’s?Ye Qingtian!”

“It looks like the rumors are true. He’s not at the Quasi-Saint Realm, and it looks like the consequences for failing to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage were serious.”

“That’s right. If he didn’t have any hidden injuries, he would’ve entered the Temporal Realm to cultivate, based on his talent, and he might be a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase now.” Lin Yun and Bai Qingyu were soon recognized when they took out their identification medals. That was especially the case with Ye Qingtian. Not only did the six holy lands know him, but even the cultivators from other domains knew about him. After all, Ye Qingtian had become famous. He’s the Sword Assembly's champion, and had even killed a Quasi-Saint while being intoxicated with alcohol.

But the cultivators from other domains looked at Ye Qingtian with gloating expressions and malice. As for those from the Eastern Desolation, their gazes were complicated.

With no one stopping them, Lin Yun and Bai Qingyu easily entered the cave. The saint disciples of the Eastern Desolation’s six holy lands and geniuses of some Ancient Saint Clans were gathered here.

When Lin Yun and Bai Qingyu came in, Lin Yun instantly recognized some familiar faces from the Heavenly Dao Sect. They were Wang Yue, Chen Zhong, and Ouyang He. They were geniuses amongst the saint disciples and even had prestigious backgrounds. Thus, they have all reached the Azure Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm.

They must’ve gone to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, or it would make no sense for their cultivation to improve so quickly. Aside from that, the five other holy lands were also present. Lin Yun was even surprised to see Young Master Wushuang here, who led the Divine Dao Pavilion’s party. Everyone was in their groups, discussing the recent events.

With a rough glance, Lin Yun discovered that everyone here had reached the Quasi-Saint Realm, and some had reached the Indigo Origin Phase. Some have even grasped greater dao, like Bai Yunfeng; even Lin Yun couldn’t see through them. Aside from those who went to the God Burial Mountain Range, all the Eastern Desolation's geniuses were here.

An extraordinary, blazing ancient tree was at the center of the stone cave. It had a height of a hundred feet, the crown was enveloped in golden flames, and chants of Buddhist mantras could be heard from the tree.

The tree had many dazzling golden lotuses, all releasing radiance of different levels. The lotuses located at the top gave off an even more sacred radiance. The golden lotus at the top was enveloped in nine different saint radiances. The bud even had sacred flames that wriggled as though they were alive. That was the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus!

Lin Yun was fascinated by that golden lotus and knew he had come to the right place. That golden lotus looked extraordinary at first glance.

“It looks like the Golden Era is really arriving. Even an ancient treasure like the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus has been revived,” Lil’ Purple exclaimed within the Iris Secret Realm.

“Senior Brother Ye, over here!” Wang Yue waved his hand when he saw Lin Yun and Bai Qingyu. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lin Yun nodded in Wang Yue’s direction before walking over with Bai Qingyu.

“He’s Ye Qingtian?” The other holy lands’ geniuses couldn’t help turning to look at Ye Qingtian.

“That’s right. He rose to great heights within the past year, first within the Heavenly Dao Sect before forging a name at Six Holy City. He’s now first on the Dragon Ranking,” another person explained. “Not long ago, he even defeated all the geniuses from the Sword Assembly and killed an Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm while being in an intoxicated state, thus becoming famous within the Kunlun Realm.”

“There’s too many legends around him. I’ve heard that the Ninth Princess came for him outside Nether Ethereal City. They even rode the same horse together!”

“That fellow is truly worthy of being called a legend. He was expelled from the Heavenly Dao Sect a year ago and rose to fame once he returned.”

“He’s a Holy Maiden Killer. I’ve heard that the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden and Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden have an explicable relationship with him. Now, even the Ninth Princess of the Divine Dragon Empire has a relationship with him.”

“But it’s a pity he has failed to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and it’s for sure that he’s destined to not appear on the Blue Dragon Record.” Ye Qingtian’s appearance caught everyone’s attention, and they all stopped what they were discussing, before turning their attention to him. After all, Ye Qingtian was too famous now, even if he stayed in the Heavenly Dao Sect for two months.

“Senior Brother Ye, look! Everyone knows about you!” Bai Qingyu smiled. She was excited upon seeing everyone’s attention on Ye Qingtian, and she even looked proud.

Lin Yun felt helpless because he wanted to maintain a low profile since Ye Qingtian’s reputation was weird.

Holy Maiden Killer? What the hell is that? Seeing how Bai Qingyu held onto his hand without any shyness, he didn’t know what to say. Even if he said he wasn’t a Holy Maiden Killer, everyone would just ask why Bai Qingyu was so close to him if he wasn’t.
