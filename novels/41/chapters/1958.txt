Chapter 1959 - Unable To Comply! (1)

“Consider yourself lucky. If not for the holy maiden, I would’ve crippled a piece of trash like you today!” Even when Ye Xin listened to Ye Qinghong, he still left behind his threat as he brushed past Ye Qingtian, acting as though he could conceal his awkwardness by saying that.

“Whatever you say,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Ha!” Ye Xin didn’t hear Lin Yun’s mockery and thought Ye Qingtian had lowered his head. Letting out a cold snort, he returned to his mat.

Meanwhile, Wang Yue, Chen Zhong, and Ouyang He fell into deep thought.

Bai Shuying looked at Ye Qingtian with a slight change in her expression because she was clearly trying to help him, but he said it had nothing to do with her. Thus, she walked away with a cold expression.

“Senior Brother Ye, the holy maiden seems to have become angry,” Yuan Chen whispered.

“I noticed,” Lin Yun replied.

“The holy maiden was trying to help you. I know you’re in disdain to explain to others, but the holy maiden is concerned about your reputation. She’s also concerned about her reputation,” Yuan Chen transmitted his voice into Lin Yun’s ears.

When hearing that, Lin Yun’s face slightly changed, but he didn’t reply to Yuan Chen. This was how he had always been. He wouldn’t waste any time with fools, and he wouldn’t waste time trying to reason with enemies. If they were unhappy, they could step out and resolve it.

As more people entered the Solar Jade Palace, Yuan Chen explained the grades of swordsmen here. The swordsmen could be divided into four factions. One was led by the Heavenly Yin Palace’s Xiao Jingyan. This person wasn’t a member of the four big clans, but belonged to a Saint Clan within the Eastern Desolation. This person was born noble with an extraordinary talent for the sword. He cultivated the Heavenly Yin Sword Sutra, a Heavenly Yin Sacred Canon branch.

The Heavenly Yin Sword Sutra was a ghost spirit martial technique. Since it came from the Heavenly Yin Sacred Canon, it could be promoted to a dragon spirit martial technique after Xiao Jingyan reaches the Quasi-Saint Realm.

It was rumored that Xiao Jingyan was a suitor of the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, and those who mocked Ye Qingtian earlier were those around him. Many Wang Clan descendants also echoed along with them. There was no question that he was the strongest within the group, or the Wang Clan’s descendants wouldn’t have acknowledged him.

The Dao Yang Palace also formed a faction with Ye Qinghong leading it. His background was similar to Xiao Jingyan, and he already had an inheritance. He already practiced the Dao Yang Sword Sutra a long time ago, and his cultivation was at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage. In the Ye Clan, he was only second to Ye Feng in regards to his status.

As a swordsman, Lin Yun naturally knew that a swordsman’s sword sutra was more important than sword techniques. He had such a high attainment in the sword thanks to the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon and Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

After all, his sword sutras were the foundation of his sword techniques. His sword techniques wouldn't be so strong if he didn’t practice these two sword sutras.

Yuan Chen wanted to tell Ye Qingtian that Xiao Jingyan and Ye Qinghong weren’t pushovers, and he couldn’t be careless. Others might think that Ye Qingtian was the one who launched a sneak attack against Ye Xin, but Yuan Chen noticed that Ye Xin was the one who wanted to launch a sneak attack first, and Ye Qingtian merely made a move faster.

Wang Yue, Chen Zhong, and the others might only suspect, but Yuan Chen was certain. This was why he was filled with revere for Ye Qingtian.

Another faction was the Nether Orchid Courtyard, led by Bai Yizhou, who practiced the Nether Orchid Sword Sutra. But even Lin Yun couldn’t see through this person’s cultivation.

Compared to the Heavenly Yin and Dao Yang Palaces’ factions, the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s faction was more united, with everyone accepting Bai Yizhou’s position, including Wang Yue, Chen Zhong, and Ouyang He. But this person laughed the loudest at Ye Qingtian, and he didn’t even bother concealing himself.

The last faction was Zhang Kui, who led the Upper Nine Peaks. But he didn’t have any inheritance cultivation technique, and Yuan Chen had no idea what cultivation technique Zhang Kui practiced. But he knew that Zhang Kui’s cultivation was the strongest. He was on the brink of breaking into the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage!

But Lin Yun merely smiled because Zhang Kui was probably the weakest amongst the four, compared to Ye Qinghong, Xiao Jingyan, and Bai Yixzhou. After all, the Zhang Clan’s foundation was the weakest amongst the four big clans within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and no one knew better than him how much a powerful sword sutra could boost the cultivator’s strength.

After all, inheritance sword sutras had an ancient history and were perfected throughout the years, fully excavating the potential of the sword sutra. As the cultivation increases, the grade of the sword sutra would also increase along the way.

This meant one could keep accumulating their foundation and not have to change a new cultivation technique as they made a breakthrough.

“Aside from them, there are also some at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage. But they didn’t join any faction or form one,” Yuan Chen continued explaining.

Lin Yun had long noticed those cultivators at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage. They were all aloof, and they only looked at him with disdain. They didn’t show any hatred, nor did they mock him earlier.

While Lin Yun was examining the surrounding swordsmen, Ye Xin softly whispered at the Dao Yang Palace’s party, “Big Brother Qinghong, why did you stop me earlier? It was a good opportunity, not to mention the holy maiden was also furious. I had the opportunity to publicly return the two slaps.”

But Ye Qinghong merely meditated with his eyes shut. He didn’t bother himself with Ye Xin, which naturally made him unhappy and furious.

Ye Qinghong didn’t say a word, but someone else sneered, “Ye Xin, even if Ye Qingtian launched a sneak attack against you, you’re that certain you can be his opponent?”

“Big Brother Yanbei, I…” Ye Xin wanted to refute those words.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

But the youth, Ye Yanbei, interrupted with a sneer, “What’s the matter? Do you want to say that you’re careless? Even if you’re not careless, you won’t be able to take him down within a hundred moves. At that time, you’re the one who’ll become a laughingstock. So stop standing out like a clown. Big Brother Qinghong naturally has his reasons.”

Ye Xin was unhappy with what Ye Yanbei said, and his face turned red. But he seemed afraid of Ye Yanbei and didn’t dare to say much. Then again, he was mainly afraid that Ye Qinghong would be furious.

Half a stick of incense later, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint descended from the sky and sat on the hovering stone platform. When she sat down, the stone platform emitted a faint saint radiance, protecting the platform.

“We pay our greetings to the martial aunt!” Everyone immediately bowed respectfully.

After all, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was one of the Three Sword Saints of the Eastern Desolation, and she was placed on the same level as the Radiant Sword Saint.

Bai Shuying soared to the sky and stood beside the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. She lit an incense and caressed her zither before sitting down and strumming her zither. Ethereal music started to spread out within the entire palace.

This made Lin Yun’s eyes light up. He was a Grand Musician who achieved the Saint King Tune. So he naturally noticed that Bai Shuying had an extraordinary attainment in music dao.
