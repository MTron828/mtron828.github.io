Chapter 1753 – Nine Nether Demonic Music

The Dual Moon Lake fell into a deadly silence because no one expected Zhang Ying to be defeated by a maid. Were the Ten Musical Clans so strong? When they looked at Mei Zihua again, their expressions became conflicted.

His arrival wasn’t only a slap on Zhang Ying’s face but also made the top hundredth unable to raise their heads. Mei Zihua’s appearance made the entire Nirvana Banquet seem like a laughingstock.

On the ship, the face of the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master became ugly. When he invited Mei Zihua, the latter was aloof. He thought Mei Zihua wasn’t interested in the Nirvana Banquet and wouldn’t come. But he never expected Mei Zihua to suddenly arrive when the Nirvana Banquet had just ended, not to mention that he was here for the Three-Lives Fruit and Three-Lives Tree.

Looking at it now, the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion might have some relationship with one Ten Musical Clans, but their relationship wasn’t deep. After all, even a junior from one of the Ten Musical Clans dared to be so arrogant at the Nirvana Banquet.

The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master furrowed his brows, but he didn’t have an excellent solution to deal with this matter. An elder asked, “Pavilion Master, should we expel them from here?”

The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master fell into a brief silence before shaking his head. There was no way they could expel them because it would be the same as offending the clan behind Mei Zihua. But he also couldn’t just keep watching.

“Qing’er, come back.” Mei Zihua said.

The maid, named Lu Qing, smiled before retreating. She had a soft figure and was a scenery on the lake itself.

“Young Pavilion Master, do you have anything else you want to say? Is there any problem with me taking up the top ten rankings?” Mei Zihua asked indifferently.

Jiang Yingtian fell silent when he heard that. What Mei Zihua said was humiliating, but he could say nothing about it.

“Shouldn’t you tell that to us, instead of him?” The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Ye Chen spoke out beside Yan Tianchen.

“That works. If you’re not convinced, you can defeat my maids in music dao.” Mei Zihua smiled.

A cold light flashed across Ye Chen’s pupils because Mei Zihua was too arrogant. He didn’t place them in his eyes at all. But right from the start to the end, Mei Zihua only glanced at Jiang Yingtian, before his gaze remained entirely on the Three-Lives Tree.

“Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Ye Chen.” Ye Chen stepped forth and cupped his hands together. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hong’er, come.” Mei Zihua said. His gaze was still on the Three-Lives Tree.

This time, a woman carried a lute and stepped forth with a smile, “Come on.”

The two fought swiftly, with Ye Chen playing the zither and the white-dressed woman playing the lute. Everyone nervously watched this battle because if Ye Chen lost, it would spell trouble for them. At that time, they wouldn’t even have the confidence to talk to Mei Zihua.

After all, the Divine Dragon Era was where strength was everything; that was the same with music dao. Even if Mei Zihua was arrogant, they would have no choice but to submit if he had the strength to back up his confidence.

At that time, the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master could only swallow it up, even if he was unhappy before taking revenge in the future when they had the ability.

As zither and lute melodies competed on the sapphire lake, the melodies sounded like two armies clashing together, with the Dual Moon Lake becoming an ancient battlefield. This made everyone’s faces change because Ye Chen and the white-dressed woman played the same song, and the artistic concepts contained in their songs were the same, Kill Zone.

If Ye Chen lost, it would be even more embarrassing. Half an incense time later, the situation gradually changed, and Ye Chen struggled with his pale face. Kill Song was an ancient score, filled with dominance and brutality by ending slaughter with slaughter.

This required strong mental energy as support. He would be in a dangerous position if he couldn’t take down his opponent quickly. The white-dressed lady relied on the Divine Snow Plum Touch to decrease her exhaustion, so she was able to easily face Ye Chen.

“I lost.” Before he could finish the song, Ye Chen lifted his hands from the zither, and his face was terrifyingly pale. He couldn’t play any longer and threw out a mouthful of blood when he was done.

“Ye Chen!” Liu Ruochen’s face changed, and he quickly approached to help Ye Chen.

“Don’t bother embarrassing yourselves if this is all you have. It looks like our young master wise to not participate in the Nirvana Banquet. You are just a bunch of barbarians who know nothing about music.” The white-dressed woman smiled, retreating with the flute.

“Stop right there! I’ll face you instead!” Liu Ruochen furiously stepped forth. But just when he stepped forth, Mei Zihua suddenly waved his hand, while his gaze was still on the Three-Lives Tree.

As an invisible soundwave rippled out, waves rose beneath Liu Ruochen, and he was forced to take several steps back under the immense power. Ye Chen’s face changed because he couldn’t avoid it in time. Just when he was about to be devoured by the waves, Yan Tianchen dashed forth and grabbed Ye Chen before retreating.

This immediately made the surroundings fall into a dead silence because they were shocked by Mei Zihua’s performance. This made everyone feel a significant blow because they had no idea how Mei Zihua accomplished that. Thus, everyone was amazed as they looked at Mei Zihua, who stood with his hands behind him.

“I already said that you don’t know music. Are you guys done? Or gave you guys not embarrassed yourselves enough?” Mei Zihua said indifferently, with fury contained in his tone that made everyone’s faces ugly. They were furious, but they could do nothing, and were powerless to refute.

“Let’s not waste time. Who’s first on the Nirvana Banquet? Get him to fight me. I want the Three-Lives Fruit.” Mei Zihua turned around to look at Jiang Yingtian.

“If Young Master Mei wants to play before the Three-Lives Tree, the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion naturally welcomes you. But the first on the Nirvana Banquet is already determined, along with the belonging of the Three-Lives Fruit. These are the rules of our Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion!” Jiang Yingtian said calmly.

Mei Zihua merely smiled and said nothing. The maid beside him who fought Ye Chen smiled, “My young master naturally knows about the rules, but rules are dead. Since my young master is here, there’s no need for the rules to continue to exist.”

Everyone’s faces changed when they heard that because they never expected a maid to be so arrogant.

“Where’s the first on the Nirvana Banquet?” The woman asked, looking around.

“My junior brother, Lin Xiao, isn’t here.” Yan Tianchen said.

“Since he’s not here, I’ll look for him.” Mei Zihua turned around.

This instantly made Yan Tianchen’s heart tremble. He was afraid that Junior Brother Lin Xiao would be caught by surprise and yelled, “Mei Zihua, you have to get past me if you want to fight my junior brother!”

“Who are you?” The white-dressed woman asked.

“Second on the Nirvana Banquet, Yan Tianchen.” Yan Tianchen said.

“Hong’er, come back.” Mei Zihua said with a playful smile. “You are second on the Nirvana Banquet? Cheng’er, go and play with him.”

His nine maids had a massive origin, and their names were Chi, Cheng, Hong, Lǜ, Qing, Lan, and Zi, with the surname Lu. Aside from that, there were two who were stronger than the rest: Lu Yu and Lu Lán. Those at Heavenly Domain City wouldn’t know about them, but they were famous in the Divine Dragon Empire. They were known as Mei Zihua’s Snow Plum Nine Jades.

They were maids nurtured for Mei Zihua by his clan and specially chosen in the Divine Dragon Empire. All nine were talented in music dao, and they were nurtured from a young age with a significant number of resources. They might be maids, but they could unleash the Great Saint Tone if they joined hands.

“Senior Brother is going to make a move?” Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan exchanged a gaze with a smear of concern in their pupils.

“You go look for the Profound Fairy and Junior Brother Lin. I’ll wait here.” Lin Wan said.

“Okay.” Luo Shuyi nodded before leaving quickly.

Back at the Dual Moon Lake, the maid named Lu Cheng stepped forth and was proficient in guzheng. On the other hand, Yan Tianchen fought with the flute. After witnessing Ye Cheng and Zhang Ying’s fight, he dared not look down on Lu Chen.

As the flute and guzheng melodies clashed, Yan Tianchen decided to cope with whatever happened. When Lu Cheng played a majestic ancient score, Yan Tianchen did the same. His flute music was filled with dense ancient rhythm. The two melodies overlapped, making the already majestic songs even more majestic.

In a short moment, anyone could tell that Yan Tianchen held the advantage while Lu Cheng barely held on with the Divine Snow Plum Touch. But she still couldn’t turn the tables around, no matter how she tried.

Seeing this scene, everyone rejoiced, finally realizing that Yan Tianchen wasn’t simple. It was no wonder why the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master felt that he could compete with Lin Xiao.

A cold light flashed across Yan Tianchen’s pupils. He had roughly estimated Lu Cheng’s strength, and no longer held back. His melody suddenly became chaotic and bizarre, making those who heard it uncomfortable.

Right then, Mei Zihua suddenly moved, and rumbling music resounded. This stopped the two melodies, and Mei Zihua said indifferently, “Go back down. You have already lost.”

“I have embarrassed the young master. Please punish me for it.” Lu Cheng said fearfully.

But Mei Zihua smiled instead, “You’re not at fault. Losing to someone from the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain is not embarrassing. I have also read about the Nine Nether Demonic Music in ancient records.”

Everyone was surprised and turned to look at Yan Tianchen when they heard what Mei Zihua said. Many people know about the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, but only a few know about the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. This was a low-key and mysterious force. It was even more mysterious than the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion, and no one knew where it was located.

“Impressive eyesight.” Yan Tianchen said.

“Your junior brother is stronger than you?” Mei Zihua smiled.

“That’s for sure.” Yan Tianchen said proudly.

“This is interesting. You’re not the same as everyone else. They know nothing about music, but at least you know bits and pieces. You have proven yourself worthy of me personally facing you.” Mei Zihua said indifferently.

Yan Tianchen’s pupils flashed with anger when he heard that because Mei Zihua wasn’t just arrogant.

“I cultivated on the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain for two years. I might not be comparable to the other senior brothers and senior sisters, nor am I comparable to geniuses like Saint Elder.” Yan Tianchen briefly paused and continued, “But those who can say that I only know bits and pieces about music aren’t born yet!”

“It’s fine. I only need a short moment to make you realize how wrong you are.” Mei Zihua smiled. When he was done, he took half a step back, and the nine maids swiftly started retrieving items from their interspatial bracelets to form a glittering stage.

As Mei Zihua sat on the stage, he raised his brow before saying, “Demonic music is a cheap trick. You can go first. Otherwise, you won’t even be able to perform when I start.”
