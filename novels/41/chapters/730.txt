Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Each of the three overlord forces had their own test. However, out of the stone statue, sword arry, and purple moon, the Indigomoon Elysium’s purple moon was the most terrifying. After all, those who went up died mysteriously of old age.

So when the purple moon flew towards Lin Yun under the control of the Indigomoon Elysium’s elders, it caused a commotion among the audience. The Northern Snow Manor’s Elder Mo was briefly stunned before his eyes surged with his killing aura as he looked at Chen Ziyu.

Chen Ziyu had provoked Lin Yun into leaving the stage, so there was nothing he could do even if he wanted to intervene. As for the four clans and Skycloud Sect’s elders, all of them rejoiced at this scene. After all, how could the Northern Snow Manor protect Lin Yun now? Just the purple moon itself was enough to kill Lin Yun.

“What an idiot.” Chen Ziyu smirked with ridicule in his eyes. So what if Lin Yun was talented? He was still destined to fall. Looking at this scene, Chu Muyan also smiled.

“This brat is destined to die today. Chen Ziyu and Chu Muyan were forced to work together to get through the test. But this time, the purple moon has launched an attack. Lin Yun is going to be killed!”

“Let us reduce him to ashes once he’s turned into a skeleton!”

“This method of dying is too easy on him!” The elders of the various forces gnashed their teeth. To them, it was too easy for Lin Yun to be reduced to ashes. After all, they prefered to vent their anger out by torturing him.

“Don’t worry. The purple moon won’t be able to kill him. Let’s wait and see what Young Master Chen does!” At this moment, Chen Wangye, the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm expert who manipulated the Profound Note Bell to suppress Lin Yun, was speaking. However, he spoke with a smile, which gave many people chills.

When the purple moon clashed with Lin Yun, the purple moonlight flowed out like liquid. It was so eerie and anything that touched it would turn black. The impact pushed Lin Yun back as blood dripped from his lips and his complexion turned pale.

“You piece of trash! Do you want to kill us? Too bad you’re not qualified to stand on this stage. Sword slave, do you dare to continue to come up?” Chu Muyan sneered with ridicule in his eyes.

“Are you two in such a hurry to die?” Lin Yun looked at Chu Muyan coldly.

“Haha, let’s talk after you get up here. Since I can defeat you in three moves five days ago, I can naturally slaughter you today as well!” laughed Chen Ziyu. The two of them were prideful as they could tell that Lin Yun was injured. Even if Lin Yun came up, he would be heavily injured. Any one of them could crush Lin Yun to death, so why would they be afraid of him?

Not only were they not afraid, but they even wanted Lin Yun to come up so that they could kill him personally. The two of them were filled with hatred for Lin Yun. After all, they told Qing Ruoyou that they already killed Lin Yun. But Lin Yun’s appearance and the fact that he killed five of the seven geniuses was a slap to their faces. So they were filled with urgency to slaughter Lin Yun.

At this moment, Qing Ruoyou’s face was terrifyingly dark. When her gaze fell onto Chen Ziyu and Chu Muyan, the pressure they felt was comparable to an enormous mountain. So one could imagine the killing intent they had towards Lin Yun.

“Sword slave, you’re only alive because of that Dragon Blooded Horse, right?” Chu Muyan looked at Lin Yun coldly, “That beast is really loyal to sacrifice itself to protect you. But it’s a pity that it died a terrible death. Oh, I forgot to tell you that we burned its corpse to ashes. Don’t you want to take revenge? We’re here waiting for you!”

Hearing that, torrential rage surged in Lin Yun’s heart with flames blazing in the depth of his pupils. He could see Chen Ziyu and Chu Muyan looking down at him with a ridiculing smile.

“Trying to provoke me? Don’t worry. I’ll go up there in a second. For now, cherish the fact that you two are still able to speak. Later, you guys will lose that opportunity for eternity.” Lin Yun’s voice was hoarse, but the way in which he spoke in a calm manner sent shivers through the crowd.

The waist of the mountain was enveloped in silence as everyone could feel the terrifying killing intent from that exchange.

“How shameless.” Guo Xu commented coldly. Clearly, the Indigomoon Elysium was targeting Lin Yun on purpose. He couldn’t imagine that an overlord force would do something so shameless.

Lin Yun looked at the purple mist enveloping his palm that made his palm age quickly. But new skin soon replaced his aged skin due to his brimming vitality. Raising his head to look at the purple moon, Lin Yun finally figured it out. The purple moon might seem bizarre, but in reality, it was just sapping vitality. It was just a demonic means akin to Lei Yunzi’s Blood Devouring Demonic Canon.

His vitality was terrifying due to the Azure Dragon Enneaform and the speed of the purple moon sapping his vitality was a lot slower than the speed of his body generating new vitality. Stomping his foot on the ground, Lin Yun soared into the sky.

This scene made Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu’s eyes light up as they both smirked at Lin Yun’s stupidity.

“Kill him!” Several elders of the Indigomoon Elysium secretly formed seals to send the purple moon down once more.

But this time, Lin Yun didn’t even bother with the moonlight as a dragon roar echoed out from within his body. His vitality began to boil within his body as one hundred and sixty cauldrons worth of strength rumbled out in the form of lightning. The soundwave of Lin Yun’s burst of power sent the closest Skymound City’s geniuses flying.

“Shatter!” Lin Yun clenched his fist that was enveloped with lightning. When his punch collided with the purple moon, cracks began to spread out before it shattered like a mirror, revealing a bloated worm pupa. It turned out that the purple moon was the egg of a demon beast.

Under everyone’s shocked gazes, lightning infiltrated the worm pupa and turned it into a cloud of blood. The elders who were manipulating the moon threw up a mouthful of blood with disbelief in their eyes, “How is this possible?!”
