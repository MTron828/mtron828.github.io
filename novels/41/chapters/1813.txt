Chapter 1814 - Riding the Sword

When Lin Yun’s fingers crossed together, he began to form the Sovereign Dragon Seal. As he formed the seal, golden-purple and blue-jade dragon runes began to merge with his body and became engraved in his flesh, blood, and bones.

Bone-cracking sounds could be heard from all over his body, and his physique was undergoing a certain transformation from inside to outside. The dragon aura he gave off suddenly burst, and there were seven divine radiances blooming on his hands.

In the next moment, a horrifying dragon aura exploded from Lin Yun with a loud explosion accompanied by a shockwave that could be seen with the naked eye. Lin Yun’s body swelled up by onefold, and his figure became a lot more robust with flames flickering within his pupils.

One of his pupils blazed with golden-purple flames, and the other was blue-jade flames. In the depth of his pupils, the Sovereign Dragon Seal bloomed. Under the guidance of the Sovereign Dragon Seal, his Blue Dragon Saint Physique and Azure Dragon Saint Physique were forcibly being merged together.

This brought a huge explosive power from Lin Yun’s body, and his gaze gave off a powerful pressure. Even the dragon origin within his violet palace had swelled up.

When Lin Yun threw another punch forth, a piercing dragon roar echoed and reverberated within this region. The sea below began to billow with a wave, and the wave continued to rise under a huge current that swiftly reached a few hundred feet in height.

As the huge wave roared, the shockwave traveled for a few thousand meters, causing the sea’s surface to violently fluctuate. This was the power of a casual punch without any martial technique. When the power spread out, the huge wave exploded before a violent rain fell on the sea.

“How powerful!” Lin Yun was excited because the dragon origin within his body was like an erupting volcano, fluctuating and coursing throughout his body like hot magma. This power far surpassed Lin Yun’s expectations, and he discovered his dragon origin had become more powerful.

“This is the Azure Dragon Divine Physique?” Lin Yun muttered to himself. He wasn’t familiar with the energy coursing through his body, but it contained a wisp of the azure dragon’s energy. It gave off a surging, violent, and ancient aura.

At the same time, a new variety of dragon runes appeared on the surface of his body. The dragon runes were generally black, with a wisp of a crimson thread in the middle.

Just like that, Lin Yun performed the Divine Solar Lunar Fist while getting familiarized with the power. Whenever he flashed on the sea, he would be accompanied by howling wind and crackling lightning. His movements could easily summon a thunderstorm, making the sea violent under this power.

When he clenched his hands together and vented all this power out, waves reaching a few thousand feet covered a thousand miles in radius.

When a thunderstorm raged in the sky, the flames within Lin Yun’s pupils gradually died down, and the light from the Sovereign Dragon Seal became dim. He exhaled a long breath and was exhausted, but his pupils were shining brightly.

“This is really powerful, but this still shouldn’t be the true power of the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.” Lin Yun’s pupils flashed with excitement. This was only an outline of the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. Since he could forcibly achieve it with the Sovereign Dragon Seal now, how powerful would the Azure Dragon Divine Physique be once the merge was complete?

Lin Yun was more confident now, and he knew he made the right choice in not choosing the Divine Azure Overlord Physique.

“Let’s give the Flicking Divine Finger a try. Since my Heavenly Dome Sword Intent has reached greater mastery, I should be able to make a breakthrough in the Flicking Divine Finger.” After reaching the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, Lin Yun still hadn’t calmed down from his excitement. The Flicking Divine Finger was a secret technique left behind by the Iris Sword Saint, and Lin Yun had been practicing it for a long time. But even so, he was still stuck at the third stage for a long time.

The Flicking Divine Finger had a total of five stages, the first stage—Flashing Aura, Flicking Fingers, the second stage—Graceful Moment, Absolute Hit, the third stage—Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword, the fourth stage—Pinnacle Finger, Great Disaster, and the fifth stage—Fingers Flick, Descending Stars.

When he was still in the Profound Amber Realm, he felt that the description of this secret technique was a little too exaggerated when he obtained it. But now that he looked at it again, it might not be an exaggeration.

The fifth stage might not literally mean destroying a star with a flick of a finger, but it might refer to a certain phenomenon. He kept practicing on the sea, and there were sword rays bursting from his finger and lingering in the surroundings for a long time.

After a few thousand attempts, Lin Yun finally had a general idea in his mind. He calmly closed his eyes and immersed himself in the profundity. He also circulated the mantra of the Flicking Divine Finger through his meridians.

When he opened his eyes again, his forehead became burning, and his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at greater mastery spread out. Raising his right hand, the Iris Saint Seal appeared on the back of his hand, and his thumb pressed down on his middle finger.

As his dragon origin began to accumulate, the Iris Saint Seal circulated, and the Azure Dragon Sword Soul flew out from his sword ocean under the manipulation of the golden human. Not long later, the Azure Dragon Sword Soul was infused into the Iris Saint Seal, causing the seal to radiate with the profundity of thunderstorms.

This made his right hand become heavy, and his entire hand looked as flawless as white jade. As his fringe fluttered, he gave off an elegant temperament. When a sword vibration echoed from within his body, swords manifested with seawater beginning to rise from the sea.

While those swords were emitting a faint radiance, each sword contained the powerful Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, and the swords all looked beautiful. Lin Yun controlled the long swords, and the thousands of swords began to tremble.

The swords were like straws growing from the ground and rushed towards him. He was instantly surrounded by thousands of swords before they condensed into a dragon that soared high into the sky.

As a terrifying sword intent exploded from Lin Yun, his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at greater mastery radiated with a terrifying power. When his sword intent climbed to a limit, Lin Yun flicked his finger, and the dragon flew away.

This wasn’t the Azure Dragon. It possessed the profundity of a thunderstorm, but the bone structure was forged with swords. It was a massive dragon of a few hundred feet, and it created a huge hole in the sea from ten miles away.

When seawater rushed towards the crater, the sword aura lingering in the hole continued to vibrate, and an abyss appeared. The sword intent lingered for a long time. Even after half a stick of incense, the crater still hadn’t closed up.

“Fourth stage—Pinnacle Finger, Great Disaster.” Lin Yun withdrew his hand and his gaze became deep. The Flicking Divine Finger was a secret technique, and it was comprehensive despite being a finger technique.

Not only could he infuse the azure dragon profundity into it, but he could also infuse nether energy or the phenomenon created by the Divine Sunchasing Art into it. This technique contained a lot of varieties with one flick.

Lin Yun began to cultivate the Azure Dragon Sword Art while using the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. As his cultivation and sword intent improved, his strength had also undergone a comprehensive boost. But this was mainly thanks to the improvement of his sword intent.

The Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at greater mastery was his greatest treasure, and the Azure Dragon Sword Art and Flicking Divine Finger were methods to excavate this treasure. After all, it was futile to have a treasure if he didn’t have enough means.

Ten days later, Lin Yun finally stopped practicing. He had tried using his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at greater mastery to perform all his martial techniques, and he could control them as he wished. After he finished resting, he slowly got up and muttered to himself, “It’s time for me to leave now.”

When the Flower Burial Sword flew out, Lin Yun smiled and soared to the sky as well. He flew beside the Flower Burial Sword and turned to look at it. His sword was also looking at him, then flew even faster. Seeing this, Lin Yun smiled, “Shall we compete to see who’s faster?”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Just like that, the sword and man began to chase after each other. This was an interesting feeling. They were like two people, companions who shared life and death together.

Even on this massive sea, Lin Yun wouldn’t feel lonely with the Flower Burial Sword beside him. When he had enough fun, he stood on the Flower Burial Sword.

When he flew out, he had become one with the sword, and his sword underwent a drastic boost. His speed was fast, and it was even faster than when he used the Divine Sunchasing Art. This was the genuine art of sword manipulation.

If he didn’t grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, he wouldn’t be able to fly, even if he stood on the sword. This was because he couldn’t be one with the sword but two separate entities, and he would fall from the sword the moment the sword moved.

Even if someone could try to forcibly bind themselves to their sword, their speed wouldn’t be able to compare to movement techniques, nor could this be maintained for long. So there was no significant meaning in doing it.

But Lin Yun was different because he rode with the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at greater mastery, and he could become one with his sword. He now truly understood the meaning of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

When he stood on the Flower Burial Sword, he had merged with the sword. The speed of his sword intent was equivalent to his actual speed, and he was enveloped in a massive sword aura.

If there was someone standing before him, they would be shredded into pieces before they could even get close. Even if there was a mountain standing before him, he could pierce through it.

Lin Yun returned the same way he came, and he discovered many Black Tortoise Ships along the way. When he was about to get close to the Black Tortoise Void Sea, he could hear a melody entering his ears. It was the Great Saint Tune.

This person was definitely showing his skills on purpose, and only those with a certain degree of attainment in music dao could hear it.

Lin Yun stopped. He wouldn’t have cared if it was any other Great Saint Tune, but he had to stop no matter what because this was the sound of erhu, and only three people knew how to play it.

When he flew over with the sword, he soon saw the person playing the erhu. It was the old man who came with them on the Black Tortoise Ship. When he stopped, the Flower Burial Sword left his feet.

After he elegantly landed on the ground, he removed the sword sheath and sheathed the Flower Burial Sword. Since he was donned a white robe, this made a drastic difference between him and the tattered old man.

“Old man, you seem to have improved your skills with it.” Lin Yun smiled. He had already recognized the old man’s identity on the Black Tortoise Ship. It was Gu Jun of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

“Still alright, I guess. But it’s a pity that it’s not Saint Elder’s spike fiddle, nor can I perform the dao rhyme.” Gu Jun placed the spike fiddle down before taking a gulp of wine.

“Why are you here so late? I’ve been waiting for you for over a month. Where’s the Wind Edge Lord’s party?” Gu Jun asked.

“Dead.” Lin Yun replied indifferently.

Gu Jun raised his brow when he heard that because he thought Lin Yun shook them off. The concept of Lin Yun killing them never crossed his mind. After all, those were four Profound Life Stage experts!

Not to mention a monstrous genius like the Wind Edge Lord definitely had treasures on him. Otherwise, the Liu Saint wouldn’t have let him come to the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

“How did you manage to do it?” Gu Jun asked in exclamation.

“Let’s not talk about that for now. How’s the situation in the Black Tortoise Void Sea? I saw a lot of Black Tortoise Ships along the way. Why are there so many people here?” Lin Yun sat on the ground and placed his sword to the side.

“Two reasons and one of them is the Demonfeather Order.” Gu Jun smiled.

Lin Yun instantly knew they came for him, so he asked, “What about the other one?”

“The Black Tortoise’s inheritance has appeared.” Gu Jun sighed.
