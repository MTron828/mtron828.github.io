Chapter 1694 – Who Allowed You To Leave?

Jiang Feng’s voice was piercing, and everyone could smell the gunpowder in the atmosphere. This made many people wear playful smiles as they looked at Lin Yun. They were looking forward to seeing how Lin Yun would respond.

But Mu Xueling furrowed her brows and said unhappily, “Lin Yun, there’s no need for you to think about what others think. I’m only asking casually, and there’s no need to participate if you haven’t grasped it yet.”

Lin Yun was surprised as he looked at Mu Xueling. At this moment, he felt that the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion wasn’t so hateful.

“Thank you, Saint Elder. There are some parts that I’ve yet to figure out, and I don’t need to participate if I can’t perform the true profundity of the Prairie Phoenix Fire.” Lin Yun replied.

“Psh.” Jiang Feng sneered. “This is an ancient score, and not even a Grand Musician can grasp its profundity. You’re pretty bold for being an incapable barbarian.”

But Lin Yun had quickly ignored him. He could feel that something was lacking in the Prairie Phoenix Fire. Even Mu Xueling’s performance was somewhat lacking, and he did not need to participate if he couldn’t figure it out. To him, he would have to be perfect if he wanted to do something.

“Jiang Feng, shut your mouth. Young Master Lin’s attainment in music dao is ten times stronger than yours!” Lin Wan finally couldn’t stand Jiang Feng’s attitude and rebuked him.

“Hahaha!” Jiang Feng laughed. “Why don’t you get that piece of garbage to come up on the stage then? Let me see how he is ‘ten times’ stronger than me!”

“Lady Lin, there’s no need for you to stoop down to his level.” Lin Yun smiled as he held onto Lin Wan.

“Hmph.” Jiang Feng coldly looked at Lin Yun. The more he looked at Lin Yun, the more annoyed he felt.

He was pissed off that Lin Yun could obtain the Profound Fairy’s recommendation, not to mention Lin Yun gave his father a beating in public. So how could he take it lying down? Not to mention Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi took advantage of their relationship with the Profound Fairy and kept trying to protect Lin Yun. He decided to teach them a lesson if there was an opportunity.

“Does anyone else want to give the Prairie Phoenix Fire a try?” Mu Xueling asked, sweeping her gaze over.

“Zhang Mu is willing to give it a try.” A purple-robed youth said with a light smile. His words immediately drew everyone’s attention. This youth was from the Divine Dragon Empire’s Zhang Saint Clan, and the Zhang Saint Clan had a powerful force in the Ancient Ice Domain.

The Kunlun Realm was split into nine domains. Aside from the Ancient Barren Domain, the other domains were the Ancient Heaven Domain, Ancient Earth Domain, Ancient Profound Domain, Ancient Wind Domain, Ancient Fire Domain, Ancient Lightning Domain, Ancient Ice Domain, and the Ancient Saint Domain. They were all under the Divine Dragon Empire’s jurisdiction.

The Ancient Wind, Ancient Fire, Ancient Lightning, and Ancient Ice Domains were within the territory of the Divine Dragon Empire. In contrast, the Ancient Heaven, Ancient Earth, Ancient Profound, and Ancient Desolate Domains were in four different directions.

According to the Divine Dragon Empire’s initial plan, the Ancient Barren Domain would spread the reach of the empire since it was located in the east, which goes the same for the three other ancient domains.

The Ancient Saint Domain was located in the center, governing and connecting the four elemental ancient domains before providing support to the Ancient Heaven, Ancient Profound, Ancient Earth, and Ancient Desolate Domains to expand the empire’s territory. This would help establish a supreme empire in the Kunlun Realm.

But there were ancient forces residing in the Eastern Desolation, Western Desert, Southern Border, and Northern Ridge. Just the Eastern Desolation alone, there were six holy lands, the Blood Moon Sect, the Demon Gate, not to mention the many other Ancient Saint Clans, each occupying a vast territory.

The Western Desert had ancient Buddhist cults; the Southern Border had many beast clans, barbarian tribes, and witchcraft; the Northern Ridge was the base for demon clans. There were also forbidden grounds left behind by the Battle of Deities, and no one knew if a terrifying existence might suddenly emerge.

Aside from that, there were also many fiend clan chiefs that even the Nine Emperors couldn’t get rid of, but could only seal them.

Even if the Divine Dragon Empire was at its peak, it was hard to unite the entire Kunlun Realm. There was a prophecy that darkness would sweep again. Based on Lin Yun’s experience in the various ruins, the fiend clans weren’t completely dead, especially the Demonspirit Clan.

Recollecting his gaze from Zhang Mu, Lin Yun realized that his thoughts had wandered too far. He could sense that Zhang Mu was strong, and he was at least a sixth-grade Saint Spiritualist. Aside from him, there were four to five people with the same cultivation, and the Nirvana Banquet’s quota was incredibly tempting to them. They all hid well and weren’t as flashy as Jiang Feng.

“Zuo Hongyun is willing to give it a try.”

“Xiang Feiyan is also willing to give it a try.”

“Count me in, as well.” It didn’t take long for those people that Lin Yun noticed to speak out, and they all wanted to display their talent to Mu Xueling. They knew that the reward of Mu Xueling’s test wasn’t just a Profound Saint Pellet. She wanted to see who the real talents were here.

A Profound Saint Pellet might be precious, but it wasn’t unobtainable by them. But it was different if they could catch Mu Xueling’s attention. Mu Xueling was a Quasi-Saint who had already stepped into the Saint Path, not to mention she even grasped the Imperial Tone. If they could catch her attention and receive personal guidance, it would significantly boost their strength before the Nirvana Banquet.

When the number of participants reached ten, Mu Xueling got them to come up to the stage to perform. It was hard to play an ancient score, and they had just started to learn the Prairie Phoenix Fire. So they wouldn’t dare to perform before Mu Xueling if they had no confidence.

“Let’s begin.” Mu Xueling said and the ten started to perform on the stage.

All ten of them were geniuses, and their attainment in music dao was shocking. Aside from being a little unfamiliar and a brief pause between playing the Prairie Phoenix Fire, they didn’t make any mistakes.

“They do have some strength.” Lin Wan whispered beside Lin Yun.

“It’s not easy to play an ancient score, even if you know the entire score. Young Master Lin, you should be proficient in ancient scores, so why didn’t you go up to play it?” Luo Shuyi asked, looking at Lin Yun. Her words also attracted Lin Wan’s attention because she was also curious.

They both heard Lin Yun’s performance, especially when he played against the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent back then. The song that Lin Yun played had left a significant impact on them. They felt that Lin Yun’s inheritance was ancient, and he wouldn’t be inferior to those on the stage if he was willing.

“Let’s just watch, first.” Lin Yun smiled.

As time passed, they reached the climax, and the phenomenon of the Prairie Phoenix Fire began to appear. Amongst the ten, Jiang Feng’s performance was the best, since he could summon the outline of a phoenix. As the phoenix flew, it scattered flames in every corner of the Saint Altar.

On the other hand, the performance of Zhang Mu and others was more reserved. Lin Yun could tell that they were concealing their full strength. They weren’t willing to compete with Jiang Feng, but the phoenixes they summoned all contained pride. This was because the ancient rhythm was hidden within it.

“Senior Brother Jiang is really formidable!”

“No wonder he dares to stand out. So Senior Brother Jiang is prepared.”

“Indeed, he’s not someone a mere barbarian can be compared to.” Jiang Feng was a disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, not to mention that he was the son of an elder. So his performance naturally drew cheers from the surroundings.

“What is there to be smug about?” Lin Wan pouted.

When they finished playing, the heat in the atmosphere still lingered. Jiang Feng was excited as he looked at Mu Xueling with anticipation.

“You guys have done a good job achieving this in your first practice. Judging from the song itself, Jiang Feng is the most outstanding, but you still lack artistic concept. So you have to practice more, and this Profound Saint Pellet goes to you.” Mu Xueling gave Jiang Feng the Profound Saint Pellet, but her gaze stopped longer on Zhang Mu and the others.

The artistic concept in their music was slightly better, but they weren’t very accurate, and the phenomenon they created wasn’t as majestic as Jiang Feng's. One could grasp the song if one practiced well, but it was hard to grasp the artistic concept just by relying on time. Strictly speaking, they had a stronger talent, which was why she hesitated in giving the Profound Saint Pellet to Jiang Feng.

“We’re done for today.” Mu Xueling soared to the sky and disappeared. Very quickly, many people flocked toward Jiang Feng, cupping their hands together as they congratulated him.

“Let’s go. I have some insights on the Prairie Phoenix Fire. I’ll play for you guys when we go back.” Lin Yun stood up. He was pondering the whole time earlier and finally figured out what was lacking in the phoenix Mu Xueling had summoned.

“Okay.” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi’s eyes lit up because they knew about Lin Yun’s attainment in music dao.

“Let’s go!” Lin Wan excitedly held onto Lin Yun’s arm.

“Young Master Lin Xiao, what women fortune you have there!” A piercing voice resounded just when they were about to leave. Jiang Feng walked out from the crowd towards Lin Yun with mockery in his pupils, “Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi are sisters with the Profound Fairy. Since Young Master Lin Xiao can win the hearts of Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi, I’m guessing that it’s just a matter of time before you win the Profound Fairy’s heart.”

“Is he even worthy?”

“This fellow’s attainment in music dao is mediocre. He even dared to claim that he was Flower Burial. How shameless can he be? The Profound Fairy must be blind to recommend him.”

“Who knows if he lied to Her Highness, the Profound Fairy.” Everyone in the surroundings began to discuss after hearing Jiang Feng’s words. After all, the Profound Fairy had a deity-like status in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. She was the dream lover of every disciple, and Jiang Feng purposely said those words to isolate Lin Yun.

“Jiang Feng, what rubbish are you talking about!” Lin Wan’s face turned dark.

“Rubbish?” Jiang Feng said coldly, “I’ve yet to deal with you. You said that this barbarian is ten times stronger than me earlier before the Saint Elder? If you don’t apologize to me today, don’t even think about leaving!”

Lin Yun furrowed his brows because he was starting to get annoyed with Jiang Feng. He already ignored Jiang Feng, but the latter kept barking around him.

“She didn’t say anything wrong, so there’s no need for her to apologize to you.” Lin Yun merely glanced at Jiang Feng before leaving with Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi.

“You want to leave? Who allowed you to leave?!” Jiang Feng’s rage flared after being ignored by Lin Yun. Pushing his movement technique to the limit, he pushed his palm forth towards Lin Yun, and he didn’t hold back in this attack. If Lin Yun was struck, he would surely be heavily injured.
