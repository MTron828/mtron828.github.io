Chapter 2198: Who’s Not A Genius?

Ye Guhan didn’t say much as he swung his sword, driving all the darkness in the Nether Orchid Courtyard away. With a flick of his wrist, he poured his saint aura into his sword, then swung it forth.

Looking at the sword ray, everyone from the Ye Clan could sense a terrifying aura blowing at them. The Quasi-Saints of the Ye Clan were sent flying away, throwing out mouthfuls of blood before the sword ray could even get close and lost their consciousness.

Everyone else from the Ye Clan’s faction was shocked because Ye Guhan was too shameless to make a move without warning. They only managed to defend against the sword ray themselves in a hurry.

Under a huge explosion, the four Saint Sovereigns and Mister Ghost took ten-odd steps back with their faces becoming ugly. The oppressive Ye Clan were forced to retreat by a sword from Ye Guhan, leaving a vast area open between both sides.

This made everyone from the Bai Clan feel relieved since they could finally catch their breath.

“Thank you, Azure River Saint…Great Saint!” The Heavenly Floral Saint Sovereign was the first to stand out. He was so emotional that he nearly called him Saint Sovereign, but it was fortunate that he came around at the last moment.

“We thank the Azure River Great Saint for your help!” The other Saint Lords from the Bai Clan came to their senses and thanked him.

Ye Guhan sheathed his sword, and smiled, “No need to thank me. Focus on treating your injuries.”

Half of the Bai Clan’s Saints were heavily injured, and even the Heavenly Floral Saint Sovereign didn’t feel great. So after hearing what Ye Guhan said, they quickly threw a pellet into their mouths.

This scene also made the Zhang Clan’s Saints, who came as reinforcements, heave a sigh of relief, but they were shocked when they looked at Ye Guhan. After all, the Ye Clan produced another Great Saint, but they were fortunate that Ye Guhan wasn’t on the same side as the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign or they would be finished.

The Saints from the Ye Clan wanted to make a move after seeing that the Bai Clan’s Saints were treating their injuries.

“Hold it.” Ye Guhan pointed his finger, unleashing a sword ray that stopped the Ye Clan’s Saints from taking a step forth.

“Ye Guhan, you traitor! Do you want to become our enemy?!” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign was so furious that he nearly threw out a mouthful of blood as he started cursing, pointing at Ye Guhan’s nose.

“Traitor?” Ye Guhan looked at the pale-faced Tough Peak Saint Sovereign, and smiled, “It looks like you’ve gotten old. Have you forgotten that I was chased out of the Ye Clan by you and your son? So how am I a traitor? Speaking of which, the resources I received from the Ye Clan aren't even a small fraction of the resources I received from my master. I have repaid the Ye Clan with that sword earlier, so you guys can get lost now. I don’t have the time to waste with you guys.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Guhan looked arrogant, and his eyes were cold despite wearing a smile on his face. He had shown mercy in that attack. Otherwise, all the Quasi-Saints from the Ye Clan would have died on the spot.

“You’re alone, and you want us to retreat?” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign said with disdain on his face. He was afraid of the Thousand Plume Great Saint because the latter was at the pinnacle of the Great Saint, and he could easily suppress them if he made a move. He might call himself the ancestor of the Ye Clan, but he only more than two thousand years old, and he had been stuck at the pinnacle of Saint Sovereign for a few hundred years. But he wouldn’t fear an ordinary Great Saint since he had plenty of means to deal with them.

Ye Guhan had only just reached the initial phase of Great Saint at best, so the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign didn’t place the former in his eyes.

“And the sword in my hand,” Ye Guhan smiled.

“Ancestor, this brat thinks that he’s invincible just because he’s a Great Saint. So let me have some fun with him,” Mister Ghost eerily smiled. He wanted to test and see how strong Ye Guhan was. Even if he couldn’t defeat Ye Guhan, it shouldn’t be an issue for him to dampen their morale.

The three colossal bronze corpses walked over, causing the ground to tremble with every step, releasing powerful auras. The surface of each bronze corpse had saint runes engraved on them.

“Ye Guhan, I have been refining these three bronze corpses for decades, and they were Saints of the Barbarian Clan when they were alive. Through my refinement, their physiques are stronger than when they were alive.” Mister Ghost controlled the three bronze corpses, and smiled, “I wonder how much has the Radiant Sword Saint taught you? Can you deal with my three bronze corpses?”

As he formed a seal, a black demonic radiance shone in the eyes of the three bronze corpses, and they raised their heads as though they came to life. The three bronze corpses swiftly dashed out, charging at Ye Guhan and performing the marital techniques they had practiced when they were alive, even their saint daos were preserved.

“Azure River Great Saint!” The Heavenly Floral Saint Sovereign wanted to help because he knew how troublesome the bronze corpses were, and half of the Bai Clan’s Saints were heavily injured by them.

This was where Mister Ghost’s confidence came from, and it was equivalent to him bulldozing half of the Bai Clan’s Saints.

“I, alone, am enough.” Ye Guhan flew out and clashed with the three bronze corpses, stopping the bronze corpses from reaching the Bai Clan. The agility displayed by the bronze corpses were shocking because they were swift despite their massive structure, and their punches could leave cracks in the surrounding space.

It didn’t take long for the three bronze corpses to be held down by Ye Guhan. Whenever Ye Guhan’s sword landed on the bronze corpses, it would cause sparks to fly around, leaving behind faint marks; however, he couldn’t inflict any injuries on the bronze corpses.

“Brat, is this the best you can do?” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign snorted with murderous intent flashing in his eyes.

The Stun Yang Saint Sovereign said, “Father, we shouldn’t show mercy to a traitor like him. I will dig out his saint origin later. After all, a Great Saint’s saint origin can be considered precious.”

“That’s too easy for him,” the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign said coldly. He hated Ye Guhan more than Ye Qianyu. He might not be able to deal with Ye Qianyu, but he couldn’t deal with Ye Guhan?

Right then, a phenomenon bloomed behind Ye Guhan as a golden sword flew out with the Golden Firmament Peak rising. When Ye Guhan soared to the sky, a golden sword ray flashed out.

This made Mister Ghost frown, but Ye Guhan had already flown out of the three bronze corpses’ encirclement when he carefully took a closer look. He quickly turned to look at his bronze corpses, and finally felt relieved after seeing that there were only faint marks left on the surface of the bronze corpses. He sneered, “What pitiful tricks. See how I’ll destroy you!”

As Mister Ghost formed seals with one hand, he pushed his hand forth and the three bronze corpses dashed out at the same time. But the moment the bronze corpses moved, the bronze corpses began to crumble into pieces, collapsing right under everyone’s gazes.

This shocked everyone, especially the Saints of the Bai Clan, who had shock in their eyes. After all, they were greatly tortured by the bronze corpses.

“H-How is this possible?! You have just reached Great Saint only recently!” Mister Ghost was feeling heartache and a great shock.

When he raised his head, Ye Guhan smiled, “Who isn’t a genius?”

“You traitor!” The Tough Peak Great Saint finally couldn’t hold himself back and completely unleashed his cultivation. His cultivation might be at the Saint Sovereign, but the aura he gave off was comparable to Great Saints, and the aura he gave off quickly suppressed the sword aura released by Ye Guhan before he turned into a black streak of light and charged at Ye Guhan, unleashing ten-odd attacks in the blink of an eye.

.

There were terrifying phenomena blooming behind him along with dao flowers, and each attack from him would force Ye Guhan to take a step back. After ten moves, Ye Guhan’s aura had dropped to rock bottom, and the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign knew that this was the moment.

With a cold flash in his eyes, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign was prepared to bring out his ultimate attack, but Ye Guhan was calm as an indigo saint sword flew out from his body.

When the two swords appeared, Ye Guhan no longer retreated, and easily blocked the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign’s attacks. As moonlight shone on Ye Guhan’s sword, he easily forced the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign to retreat.

“Ha!” Ye Guhan sneered, and took a step forth as a scarlet sword flew out from his body. Empowered by three swords, Ye Guhan’s attacks easily tore apart the saint aura around the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign, leaving behind a crack in the latter’s armor.

As blood splashed out from the crack, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign let out a scream. He didn’t know how many years had passed since he suffered injuries.

“Come again!” Ye Guhan took a step forth, unleashing three swords as more swords flew out from his body. He was like a Sword God as he fought the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign with a great advantage. After taking a few steps, seven swords appeared behind Ye Guhan, and his sword intent reached a horrifying height.

“The Great Profound Sword Canon!” Those from the Zhang Clan and Bai Clan recognized the sword technique that Ye Guhan was executing. That was the ultimate cultivation technique of the Sword Sect, the Great Profound Sword Canon.

When the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign landed on the ground, he was covered in blood as he looked at Ye Guhan with his lips trembling. He pointed at Ye Guhan, and said, “Ye Guhan, I’m your ancestor!”

“It’s better to call me the Azure River Sword Saint, don’t call me by my name because we’re not familiar with each other.” Ye Guhan grinned, then he continued, “Today, I’m beating the ancestor!”

The moment he said that, Ye Guhan charged at the Ye Clan with the seven swords, fighting the five Saint Sovereigns of the Ye Clan.

The other Ye Clan’s Saints wanted to make a move, but they were injured by the sword ray before they could even get close, so they retreated with their faces becoming pale.

The Ye Clan had five Saint Sovereigns, if they included Mister Ghost. But they were one-sidedly suppressed under Ye Guhan’s sword without the ability to resist, and this was a horrifying feat.

Under the Great Profound Sword Canon, Ye Guhan executed the Great Profound Sword Array with the seven swords, suppressing the five Saint Sovereigns.

“Who isn’t a genius?!” Ye Guhan swung his sword as the seven mountains combined together and unleashed an explosion. The explosion felt as though it would rip the sky apart, and the five Saint Sovereigns of the Ye Clan threw out mouthfuls of blood.

But that wasn’t all Ye Guhan pointed with his sword and sword rays shone from him, forming into a massive sword ray that flew out. The horrifying sword ray descended from the sky with ancient scriptures engraved on the sword ray.

Following an explosion, the five Saint Sovereigns were sent flying away as sword aura rumbled, and they were forced down on their knees by the sword aura.

“Well, I’m really honored to receive such a huge bow from the ancestor,” Ye Guhan said expressionlessly.

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign heaved a sigh of relief, thinking that Ye Guhan was afraid.

But Ye Guhan indifferently said, “But it’s better to keep you out of my sight.”

As soon as he finished, a sword ray flew across the sky, piercing the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign’s chest and nailing him to a mountain a hundred miles away, leaving everyone from the Bai Clan and Zhang Clan dumbfounded. This is the chief disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint?
