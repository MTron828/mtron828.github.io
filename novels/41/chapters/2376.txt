Chapter 2377 - You Don't Need Too Many As Long As They're Enough

Mu Qianxue’s cheeks trembled under Lin Yun’s gaze, feeling reluctant. The surrounding area also fell silent, finally realising that Lin Yun was serious about what he said.

Looking at Can Jue with his severed arms, Mu Qianxue’s complexion became terrifyingly pale. He knew that severing the arms and legs wasn’t fatal to a Saint, since they could stop the blood by relying on their powerful life force. It would only take them half a month to recover from their injuries. But seeing that Can Jue was still bleeding from his wounds, Lin Yun had left his sword intent within Can Jue’s wounds on purpose, and that was the Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent. If they didn’t have the help of a senior, it would take them a few months to recover.

“I won’t give up...” Mu Qianxue said. Right now, he wanted to surrender in this fight before competing for a lotus and no longer wanted to be involved.

“I know what you’re thinking, but you can give up. What you want to do is impossible, so I’ll let you make a move yourself,” Lin Yun said indifferently. “If I do it for you, it will take at least half a year for you to recover.”

“You’re ruthless!” Mu Qianxue gritted his teeth before shaking his arms, severing them. He then said in a hateful tone, “Are you satisfied now?”

“You don’t seem convinced?” Lin Yun smiled.

Mu Qianxue didn’t dare to say another word and left. The stage fell into silence, while Can Jue was also brought away.

Out of the six geniuses, only Qin Yun, Jiang Ziyao, and Heavenly Book were left. This included Tuoba Hong, but he was groaning in pain on the ground and didn’t have the dominance of a primordial beast.

The silence on the stage was terrifying, and the spectators didn’t dare to say a word. No one expected that this matter would develop in this manner. They thought that it would be a one-sided battle, but Lin Yun was trampling on them one by one.

As for the three remaining, Qin Yun, Jiang Ziyao, and Heavenly Book were the strongest. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Those three are too tough to deal with... Should we help?” Xiong Tiannan asked.

“Let’s watch the situation, first. Lin Yun has no intention of asking us for help, so he was probably waiting for this moment,” Lin Jiangxian said. “These people said that it was fair earlier, but they probably never expected that it was also fair in Lin Yun’s eyes.”

Jiang Ziyao and Heavenly Book exchanged a gaze, then said, “Brother Qin, there’s no need to talk about righteousness with someone like that. We can gang up on him together.”

They now regret that they didn’t make a move against Lin Yun together earlier, allowing Lin Yun to defeat them slowly.

“There’s no need. The Dao Sect is a holy land on the same level as Heaven’s Gate, so I can’t afford to embarrass myself by joining hands with others to deal with a genius from the Kunlun Realm,” Qin Yun said, shaking his head. His words caused an uproar, and everyone wondered if Qin Yun would finally make a move.

Lin Yun raised his brow, and smiled, “Not bad. You have changed my impression of you.”

“Do I need you to change your impression of me?” Qin Yun sneered, before a powerful aura emerged from him with seven golden lotuses appearing behind him. A golden lotus represented a Sovereign Dao, meaning that Qin Yun grasped seven Sovereign Daos. When the golden lotuses appeared, everyone’s faces changed.

“Seven Sovereign Daos!” Everyone’s faces changed. They knew the Dao Sect was strong, but they didn’t expect it to be that powerful.

Lin Yun squinted with excitement flashing in his eyes.

Qin Yun took a step forward, and stars appeared around him. After becoming an eighth-stage Saint Lord, the primordial aura would condense into stars in the violet palace, strengthening the saint energy. Before anyone could respond, Qin Yun took another step forth as a star lit up.

He took seven steps, and seven stars appeared with the aura he gave off, reaching a terrifying height. As he released his aura in Lin Yun’s direction, he snorted, “Do I need you to change your impression of me?”

Before he moved, the aura he gave off had already created fine cracks in Lin Yun’s Sword Domain, shocking everyone. Seven Sovereign Daos and seven stars, it looked like Qin Yun was unfathomable.

He snorted, “Now, do you know why I refused to join hands with them? I naturally won’t underestimate you, but I’m enough to deal with you!”

Looking at his collapsing Sword Domain, Lin Yun smiled, “There’s no need to grasp so many daos as long as you're proficient enough. I might have been afraid if you focused on one, but I don’t place you in my eyes now.”

Honestly speaking, Lin Yun was startled when he saw seven Sovereign Daos. But after looking over them, he inwardly laughed because the seven Sovereign Daos only looked terrifying. They weren't perfectly combined. With just a glance, he already noticed many flaws in them.

“You don’t believe me? We can give it a try, then.” Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword, and his Sword Domain slowly recovered and became flawless.

“You’re arrogant, and it looks like you have to be taught a lesson,” Qin Yun snorted, before he charged forth. As he charged forth, a golden lotus behind him scattered, meaning he had mobilized a Sovereign Dao.

“Death Dao!” Qin Yun’s eyes became black, and he performed a palm technique. He didn’t just grasp seven Sovereign Daos, he also practiced a high-grade dragon spirit martial technique for each Sovereign Dao. So, when he used the Nether Palm Technique, he drew a series of exclamations from the surrounding area.

Aside from that, the other six Sovereign Daos also began to revolve as they suppressed Lin Yun’s Sword Domain and sword aura, splitting his heart into seven.

“Haha! He’s finished now!” Jiang Ziyao’s eyes lit up.

But Lin Yun merely smiled as he used the Divine Firefly Sword to face Qin Yun. The Divine Firefly Sword had three sections, and Lin Yun had mastered them all. He was no longer restricted to the sword technique and had completely merged the profundity into his sword.

No matter how profound the Nether Palm Technique was, Qin Yun couldn’t suppress Lin Yun, and the advantage in his cultivation became useless.

“What’s going on?” Qin Yun was shocked, and couldn’t help looking at the youth who looked at him with a smile.

“Blooming Stars!” Lin Yun flicked his wrist, and thirty-eight afterimages flew out, resolving the Nether Palm Technique.

“Death Dao is broken!” Shangguan Jue and Zhao Zhanli’s faces changed beside Heavenly Book.

The Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples, beside Jiang Ziyao, were shocked. Could Death Dao be so easily broken?

“Asura Dao!” Qin Yun’s face changed as he executed another Sovereign Dao. This was Asura Dao, which was upgraded from Slaughter Dao. A crimson spear also appeared in his hand, making Qin Yun look like a lord in hell, before he charged forth.

When the sword and spear clashed, each collision would produce a huge commotion. But ten-odd moves later, Qin Yun’s spear was knocked away. However, Lin Yun looked like a Sword Immortal with his hair fluttering.

“Devour Dao!” Qin Yun roared as he soared to the sky, enveloped in golden radiance. He opened his mouth and took in a deep breath as he devoured half of the saint aura on the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain, and this was a shocking scene.

“Not good!” Profound Sky Venerable’s face changed beside Ji Zixi. “Devour Dao has a huge advantage on Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain.”

The Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain was a saint mountain, and there were saint veins here. So it was naturally filled with a terrifying amount of saint aura. Although Qin Yun couldn’t last long in this state, he only needed one attack to inflict heavy injuries on Lin Yun.

Qin Yun devoured so much saint aura that he began to bleed from his skin, and his face became sinister. He wouldn’t last for long in this state.

The surrounding geniuses were shocked because they never imagined that the fight between them would come this far. They had never seen this before, and they were greatly shocked.

“Is that still a Saint Lord?” Someone asked in disbelief.

“You think that only you know this move?” Lin Yun snorted as he circulated the Great Profound Sword Canon and seven saint swords appeared behind him, followed by seven mountains. When the Great Profound Sword Array was activated, the remaining saint aura on the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain was devoured.

This was a shocking move as the seven swords intertwined and formed into tens of thousands of swords that overlapped together. The sword ray around Lin Yun exploded, piercing through the sky.

“Die!” Qin Yun moved as all the saint aura he devoured formed into a giant palm, reaching Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s hair fluttered violently under the wind, and he roared, “As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies!”

As the Great Profound Sword Array revolved, it unleashed a massive sword ray at the giant palm, piercing through that palm. This made Qin Yun scream out in pain, and the scream resounded throughout Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain.

“Holy shit, he even broke the Dao Sect’s Heavenly Desolate Starshattering Palm,” Profound Sky Venerable said with his scalp becoming numb.

Lin Yun hovered in the air, while looking at Qin Yun, “Qin Yun, you don’t need so many daos as long as you're proficient enough.”

“You’re trying to teach me what to do?” Qin Yun was furious, and let out a roar. He couldn’t even be bothered to use the remaining Sovereign Daos. Two energies suddenly swept out from his body, Yin and Yang. All of his Sovereign Daos had also merged into the black and white energy, and the aura he gave off became even more terrifying.

“Eternal Dao!”

“That's Yin-Yang Dao!”

“That’s the Yin-Yang Dao of the Dao Sect!” Exclamations resounded, knowing that Qin Yun was forced to a dead end since he even brought out the Eternal Dao he hadn’t fully grasped yet.

“Yin-Yang? What a coincidence. I, too, know it.” Lin Yun smiled as the Flower Burial Sword flew out, and he activated the Flaming Yin-Yang Painting he got from the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron.
