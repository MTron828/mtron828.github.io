Chapter 1522 - The Invincible Sword! (2)

This scene left Murong Chen in lingering fear, and he rejoiced at the fact that Lin Yun’s sword wasn’t directed at him. When the sword ray reappeared, Ling Qianye fell from the sky. He was covered in injuries, his clothes dyed in his own blood, and his hair was scattered about. Even the crimson moon behind him had become terrifyingly dim.

When Murong Chen and Ling Qianye looked at Lin Yun again, they were both deeply shocked. This was because they didn’t expect to be in a disadvantageous position even after joining forces.

Lin Yun’s Aquaheaven Sword Technique had reached the manifestation stage, easily suppressing both Murong Chen and Ling Qianye’s ghost spirit martial techniques.

But Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t give Murong Chen and Ling Qianye the time to catch their breaths and executed the last move of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique. As the Flower Burial Sword in his hand emitted a dazzling radiance, it was like an enchanting plum blossom in the snow.

His sword might seem gentle, but a terrifying might accompanied it. When he swung his sword, both Murong Chen and Ling Qianye executed various means to defend against this move. But no matter how they tried, they couldn’t put up any resistance against Lin Yun’s attack.

When Murong Chen and Ling Qianye unleashed their astral energies, they raised their weapons before them, trying to defend themselves. But after they took ten-odd steps back, they ultimately threw out a mouthful of blood each before they were sent flying away.

Seeing this, Lin Yun could feel that his blood boiling within his body. He swiftly traveled around the hall while spreading his arms apart. He was Flower Burial, burying both flowers and people alike.

When he sped around the hall, his sword aura made the surroundings tremble, and he was like a dragon flying within the hall while being accompanied by a monarch aura. This made both Murong Chen and Ling Qianye’s faces change as they quickly raised their weapons in a hurry to defend themselves.

They were both gritting their teeth when they blocked Lin Yun’s attack, waiting for his aura to drop before unleashing a lethal attack upon him. But they were destined to be disappointed. Lin Yun’s aura was blazing like a wildfire and showed no signs of declining.

This left both Murong Chen and Ling Qianye in disbelief as they wondered if Lin Yun was really a dragon. Their confidence was also slowly crumbling under Lin Yun’s attack.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Then, Lin Yun used his sword like a brush when he swung his sword. He didn’t hold back in this attack and used the Heavenly Sword Form. A dazzling radiance shone brightly as a gigantic ‘heaven’ appeared in the air. The dazzling sword ray easily destroyed Murong Chen and Ling Qianye’s confidence.

Lin Yun’s attack easily destroyed the astral energies that protected the two of them before they were sent flying away. Countless cracks also appeared in their internal organs, which meant that they were both heavily injured. When they fell to the ground, they were heavily gasping for breath.

Murong Chen’s face became pale as thoughts of retreating surfaced in his mind. But just when he wanted to leave, he raised his head to see a pair of cold eyes, and he couldn’t help feeling a chill run down his spine. This also made him stop retreating.

“You want to leave?” Lin Yun asked. “You can leave, but you must leave your interspatial bracelet behind. I remember you said that it has a Netherflower, right?”

“You!” Murong Chen instantly flew into a rage. “Lin Yun, don’t push it. You already won the Divine Dragon Bone. If you push it, I don’t mind exploding myself. You can give up on the Divine Dragon Bone at that time!”

“Go ahead and try, then.” Lin Yun replied. He was confident in facing Murong Chen’s self-destruct, which would only mean he couldn’t obtain the interspatial bracelet.

“What about him? Why didn’t you ask for his treasures?!” Murong Chen’s face was dark. It felt as if Lin Yun was targeting him. So he naturally wanted to drag Ling Qianye down with him.

“I already said that I’m more interested in your treasures.” Lin Yun said.

Murong Chen instantly fell into despair as he gritted his teeth. This was because he really didn’t want to hand over the Netherflower. But he also knew that he didn’t have any choice right now.

His life was in Lin Yun’s hands, and he could do nothing to Lin Yun when they were defeated, even after they ganged up on Lin Yun. In the end, he could only unwillingly hand over the Netherflower.

Before he left, he glared at Lin Yun and planned to settle this with him outside the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. He refused to believe that Lin Yun could leave with the Blue Dragon Bone and Netherflower in front of the Netherworld Hall and the other demonic sects.

With that, Lin Yun and Ling Qianye were the only ones left in the hall, and Ling Qianye broke the silence, “I admit my defeat. You can ask me for anything you want since you won.”

“You can leave.” Lin Yun didn’t even look at Ling Qianye. There was no need for him to push Ling Qianye into a corner. If Ling Qianye chose to self-destruct, it would be a piece of bad news for him, even if he could come out of the whole ordeal alive. The hall was a secluded space, and he could not dodge the explosion even if he wanted to.

Ling Qianye was surprised to hear what Lin Yun said. He fell into a deep silence for a long time before he cupped his hands together, “I’ll remember this favor.”

But before he raised his head, a sinister smile rose on his lips and the Profound Moon Fan in his hand turned into crimson petals that filled the entire hall. A crimson array instantly appeared on the ground with the crimson flowers drifting in the air.

Taking opportunity of this moment, he took a step forth, and his hand fell onto Lin Yun’s shoulder. With a smile, Ling Qianye said, “I’ll return your favor in your afterlife! Not even monstrous geniuses who have condensed their dragon origin can withstand this Blood Devouring Demonic Array. So I’ll be taking your cultivation!”

Everything might occur in the blink of an eye, but Ling Qianye had been planning this from the moment he failed. When his palm fell onto Lin Yun’s shoulder, a terrifying suction force exploded, and Lin Yun’s 30,000-foot astral energy ocean began to wither. On the other hand, Ling Qianye was excited, with his face turning red.

“It’s painful, right? Don’t worry about it because it’ll be over soon!” Ling Qianye grinned as he felt Lin Yun’s cultivation declining.

But Lin Yun was looking at him like he was looking at a fool, allowing Ling Qianye to execute the Blood Devouring Demonic Array. This made Ling Qianye feel uneasy, and he quickened the pace of devouring Lin Yun’s cultivation.

Just when Lin Yun’s astral energy was about to hit rock bottom, Ling Qianye’s face suddenly changed. It was as if he had seen something terrifying. It was a demonic cauldron at the bottom of the emptied astral energy ocean.

When the demonic cauldron slowly rose into the air, the astral energy that Ling Qianye had devoured was returned to Lin Yun at a hundred times the speed. But that wasn’t all, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron was also devouring Ling Qianye’s cultivation, and there was nothing he could do to resist it.

Ling Qianye was utterly dumbfounded and couldn’t believe what was happening. He wanted to lift his hand from Lin Yun’s shoulder, but he realized he couldn’t move his hand at all.

“Die!” But Lin Yun had no intention of taking Ling Qianye’s cultivation at all. Ling Qianye’s demonic aura was too heavy. So he immediately slammed his palm against Ling Qianye’s head. As blood splattered, Ling Qianye’s headless corpse fell to the ground.
