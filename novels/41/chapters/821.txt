Chapter 822 - Four-clawed Gold Dragon

Facing Lin Yun’s sword, Fang Hanluo only hesitated briefly before he threw a punch. However, Fang Hanluo’s dazzling punch lasted a second before it crumbled under the Thunderbolt Slash.

Blood dripped from Fang Hanluo’s lips as his face had a grave expression. The power of Lin Yun’s sword had exceeded his expectations. The exchange of lightning and cold rays created several phenomena on the stage as Lin Yun and Fang Hanluo stared at each other.

Fang Hanluo’s injuries weren’t light, but he kept his cool and charged at Lin Yun. Pushing his cultivation to the limit, Fang Hanluo glowed with a cold light. Then, he threw a punch with an explosion of immense chill, “Heavenly Frost Annihilation!”

“What a powerful foundation.” Lin Yun was surprised because he noticed that Fang Hanluo’s foundation was terrifying. Even if his cultivation technique wasn’t comparable to the Iris Sword Sutra, it wasn’t far off. This meant that he must’ve started cultivating from a young age and was probably even nourished with pellets when he was in his mother’s wound.

All Fang Hanluo did in this banquet was excavate his foundation to bring himself to the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. This was the only reason why he was evenly matched with Lin Yun. This also meant that Fang Hanluo must have a powerful clan or sect behind him.

Overlord Sword?—Solar Slash!

Collecting himself, a pair of wings unfolded next to Lin Yun as he charged forward. He weaved through the blizzard and faced Fang Hanluo’s punch head-on. Along with a collision, most of the origin energy Lin Yun used to protect himself crumbled. However, he didn’t suffer any injuries. Tightening his grip on his sword, he stabbed his sword at Fang Hanluo’s right shoulder.

With a metallic collision, Fang Hanluo’s clothes exploded and he was sent flying away with a shallow wound on his shoulder.

“What a terrifying physique…”

“He’s probably the only one capable of taking Lin Yun’s attack head-on.”

“No wonder he could last long enough to make his breakthroughs. It turns out that his physique is his trump card.” Everyone was shocked by Fang Hanluo’s physique, but it made sense.

“Oops, it looks like I revealed a little secret of mine.” Fang Hanluo smiled. With his clothes destroyed and his upper body revealed, his skin flickered with the cold luster of a thousand year old jade.

“In terms of explosive power, my Indigo Frost Battle Physique might not be comparable to your Azure Dragon Battle Physique. However, it will be hard for you to injure me.” As Fang Hanluo spoke, a purple aura began to wander around Fang Hanluo. Not giving Lin Yun any time to react, he raised his hand and attacked Lin Yun.

In mid-air, Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because he saw half of his sword’s power dissipate because of Fang Hanluo’s movement technique. The fluctuation was extremely hidden, but Lin Yun still sensed it.

Lin Yun briefly hesitated before he pretended not to notice the fluctuation. He was determined to strengthen his Azure Dragon Sword Aura over getting an easy win.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed brightly as his boundless sword intent formed a majestic dragon behind him. The dragon’s eyes flickered with dazzling sword rays. Additionally, every single one of its scales were flickering with lightning and wind energy. The dragon was completely different from any other phenomenon.

As wind and lightning surged, people could sense that the azure dragon was like a terrifyingly sharp sword. The azure dragon even had a vague image of a sword at its center.

Pushing the Azure Dragon Sword Aura to the limit, a powerful aura emitted out that caused the surrounding air to tremble violently. Fang Hanluo’s punch started to crumble before it could get close to Lin Yun. Lin Yun’s azure dragon was as strong as ever, leaving many people dumbfounded.

“What the hell is going on? How can sword intent be that powerful?”

“Isn’t his xiantian sword intent barely at complete mastery? Why does it feel like his sword intent isn’t weaker than Nangong Wanyu and Bai Lixuan…”

“Azure Dragon Sword Intent?” Many geniuses could manifest their sword intent into a dragon, but it was unheard of for anyone to make something so vivid.

Lin Yun and Fang Hanluo continued to clash with each other amid the discussions. Pushing his sword to the limit, Lin Yun left deep gashes on Fang Hanluo whose attacks kept collapsing. The defense that Fang Hanluo claimed to be so tough was nothing before Lin Yun.

“Terranean Blizzard!” Fang Hanluo barked as he frantically circulated the origin energy within his body. His physique shined brightly as he geared up for another attack. The frost intent contained in his sword was unbelievable as it manifested an ancient ferocious beast that tried to bite Lin Yun.

“Overlord Sword–Big Bang!” The azure dragon behind Lin Yun flickered with boundless lightning as it slowly formed a sphere of lightning. The lightning surged and devoured all of the sword intent on the stage before exploding like a bright star.

“Explode!” Lin Yun’s clothes fluttered in the wind before he stabbed out with his sword, slicing the ancient beast in half. Then, his sword stabbed Fang Hanluo’s body.

Fang Hanluo retreated as fast as he could when he felt the tip of Lin Yun’s sword pierce him. Ice fragments trailed behind him as his defensive shield started to crack. Lin Yun’s lightning and wind energies were slowly wearing him down.

“He can’t hold on anymore.”The audience sucked in a deep breath as they imagined the pain Fang Hanluo was feeling. Then, someone noticed that the azure dragon was slowly merging with Lin Yun’s sword.

Just when he was about to be forced off of the stage, Fang Hanluo’s eyes flashed with insanity. He gnashed his teeth and let his defensive shield break, allowing Lin Yun’s sword to stab into his body. At the same time, his right hand turned into a shard of ice that he used to stab Lin Yun’s throat.

Lin Yun was prepared for this move, so he flicked his finger at Fang Hanyu and retreated.

“Nebula Blade!” Fang Hanluo had no intention of letting Lin Yun go. Gaining momentum, he unleashed an icy tornado to destroy Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s heart jolted as he sensed his sword intent and azure dragon aura combining. But because he was distracted, the tornado was able to reach him.

Pouring the Azure Dragon Sword Aura into his sword, Lin Yun split the colossal tornado into two. Lin Yun’s attack continued to fly through the air and eventually hit Fang Hanluo, sending him flying.

Throwing up a mouthful of blood, Fang Hanluo’s face turned pale. However, he had no intention of admitting defeat.

Lin Yun knew what Fang Hanluo wanted to do, so he sheathed his sword. He landed on the ground and took a step forward, which made Fang Hanluo’s face change. Lin Yun was about to step on an area that would dissolve his sword intent.

Gnashing his teeth, Fang Hanluo spun himself in mid-air and changed his position. However, Lin Yun took another step forward to put pressure on him. Everytime Fang Hanluo changed positions, Lin Yun was close behind.

Lin Yun did this several more times before Fan Hanluo’s injuries finally erupted. Vomiting up blood, Fang Hanluo fell to the ground. “I give up.”

Fang Hanluo staggered to his feet and admitted defeat. He knew that Lin Yun had seen through his movement technique, which meant he had lost. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“It wouldn’t be easy for me to defeat you without the Azure Dragon Sword Aura,” replied Lin Yun. Fang Hanluo’s physique was strong, so he knew that it was impossible for him to defeat Fang Hanluo with just the Overlord Sword and xiantian sword intent at complete mastery.

Lin Yun also wasn’t confident that Supreme Dominance would help out. After all, he would need to use his spiritual sword intent for that. However, his azure dragon aura and sword intent merged at the right time, forming the Azure Dragon Sword Intent. This was a completely new sword intent that solely belonged to him.

“I can’t defeat you since you’ve seen through my movement technique,” said Fang Hanluo with a bitter smile.

After devouring half of Fang Hanluo’s profound amber aura, Lin Yun’s dragon projection grew its fourth claw. It was even more dazzling than Yu Haotian’s dragon projection.
