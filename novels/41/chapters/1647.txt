Chapter 1648 - I'll Be Taking Your Life Today! (2)

“Hmph!” Qin Tian snorted and flicked his finger. But after Lin Yun executed the glory spirits in the Flower Burial Sword, this significantly increased the sword’s weight. So Qin Tian’s flick couldn’t change the trajectory of Lin Yun’s sword. When the Flower Burial Sword vibrated, it caused the surrounding space to tremble.

This scene made Qin Tian’s face change, and he quickly tilted his head aside to avoid Lin Yun’s thrust, but several strands of his hair were severed.

Lin Yun’s sword rays were dazzling and swift. Even if Qin Tian had moved quickly, he ultimately failed to avoid Lin Yun’s attack, allowing Lin Yun’s sword to stab into his chest, where the Golden Dragon Bone was located.

The collision created a metallic clash that blew Qin Tian’s upper clothes apart with wounds left on his body, and Lin Yun’s sword ultimately failed to reach Qin Tian’s chest. As Qin Tian’s face changed, he threw out a mouthful of blood that was aimed at Lin Yun’s eyes.

Seeing this, Lin Yun swiftly drew his sword back and used it like a fan to sweep the blood away. The mouthful of blood that Qin Tian threw out swiftly manifested into a golden blood dragon that instantly expanded in size by ten-fold.

When everyone in the surroundings saw this scene, they were startled because they didn’t expect Qin Tian would have such a sinister move.

“Such pitiful tricks.” Lin Yun shook his wrist and spun the Flower Burial Sword in his hand. When the sword rays intertwined, the blood dragon was instantly crushed.

Taking his opportunity, Qin Tian swiftly retreated and stared at Lin Yun. This was because he realized that he had underestimated the Flower Burial Sword.

“He failed to injure Qin Tian even with this much?”

“How terrifying…” Everyone in the surroundings had disbelief in their pupils when they looked at Qin Tian’s condition.

After Qin Tian landed on the ground, he threw out a mouthful of blood and started laughing manically, “Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, is this the best you can do? If that’s the best you can do, I’ll tell you why I’m invincible today! Use whatever means you have and do your best to stay alive!”

As he spoke, he waved his hand, and a golden flag appeared in his hand.

“That’s the Golden Dragon Divine Flag! That’s a Glory Saint Artifact that only the Divine Dragon Empire possesses!”

“It’s a Divine Dragon Flag!” Everyone was shocked when they saw this scene because they were again dumbfounded by Qin Tian’s trump card.

When Lin Yun looked at that flag, he saw that it looked like a long spear with a sharp tip, and there was a Golden Dragon engraved on the flag.

“With the Divine Dragon here, who can compete with me?!” Qin Tian laughed before charging at Lin Yun.

They no longer held back in their attacks when Lin Yun and Qin Tian had brought out their glory saint artifacts. Their speed was so fast that their figures became blurred. With the empowerment of two glory saint artifacts, the aura released from them was frightening.

Whenever their weapons clashed, the sky would alternate between light and dark, and they would unleash sonic booms whenever they shuttled back and forth. As for everyone who was witnessing this battle, they were dumbfounded.

As the Flower Burial Sword and Golden Dragon Divine Flag collided, their faces changed, and they gritted their teeth before sparing a hand to unleash an attack at each other.

“Sovereign Dragon Seal!”

“Sun-Moon Wheel Slash!” Their glory saint artifacts clashed, but they didn’t hesitate to unleash their attacks with another hand.

After a clash, the sky shattered with starlight sweeping backward. Their movement techniques were fast, but they couldn’t avoid each other’s attacks altogether. Sword rays would occasionally land on Qin Tian’s body, while the flag occasionally landed on Lin Yun’s body.

As Qin Tian’s hair wildly fluttered in the wind, his laughter roared, “You can’t defeat me!”

But his face suddenly became pale before he spat out another mouthful of blood that shot forth like an arrow. This was different from the previous secret technique because he took the initiative to attack this time. When the blood arrow left his mouth, it immediately started burning.

The blood arrow swiftly formed into a blood dragon that charged forth. The two of them were still clashing, and there was no way Lin Yun could avoid this attack in time. Even everyone else in the surroundings could see how sinister this attack was.

“Junior Brother Lin!”

“Young Master Lin!” An Liuyan, Mu Xueqin, and the others panicked when they saw this scene and exclaimed.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“You’re courting death!” Lin Yun’s pupils flashed with fury, and he snorted, “Divine Azure Annihilation!”

The golden human in his sword ocean shone as a golden azure dragon flew out from the ocean and left his sword ocean. The blood dragon was instantly destroyed by the golden azure dragon the moment they clashed before the golden azure dragon charged forth and slammed against Qin Tian’s body.

But Lin Yun had no change on his face as he swung his sword out twice. The first sword knocked the Golden Dragon Divine Flag away before the second sword sent Qin Tian flying back.

“I’ll be taking your life today!” Lin Yun’s hair and his clothes violently fluttered in the wind as forty thousand dragon runes manifested into an Azure Dragon. When he descended, he landed on the Azure Dragon’s head.

“Not good!” When the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples on the altar saw this scene, they swiftly dashed forth. Liu Xu and Zhang Yuan’s faces also changed, and they couldn’t consider the situation that much as they rose to the sky.

“Wanting to take advantage of numbers?” Gongsun Yan and others were instantly enraged by this scene. They had been unhappy with Qin Tian for a long time. Thus, they all soared to the sky, sending their sword rays streaking across the horizon and arriving beside Lin Yun, wanting to help him.

“Liuyan, Ziling, you two lead everyone to save the Sword Sect’s disciples. Don’t let a single one of them die. As for this, leave it to me.” Lin Yun said, standing on the azure dragon’s head.

“Be careful.” The two ladies gritted their teeth and said, “Let’s go!”

Like that, they turned into sword rays that streaked towards the Profound Sky Array.
