Chapter 1979 - One At A Time

Seeing that Young Master Wushuang wasn’t modest, Bai Yizhou continued with a smile, “We all know that my clan’s Nether Orchid Holy Maiden is interested in music dao, and she would often practice it. So I’ll have to trouble Young Master Wushuang to provide some guidance during tomorrow’s banquet.”

Young Master Wushuang raised his glass and smiled, “I don’t dare to say for others, but I have some music dao experience. Let’s take the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden’s music, for example. Her music might sound beautiful, but it isn’t accurate enough. The characteristic of the erhu is soft and lyrical, but its foundation is sorrowful and mournful. You won’t be able to play the essence if you can’t grasp those two points.”

Bai Yizhou and the others nodded, but no one knew if they really understood or were just pretending to understand. They smiled, “I see! We’ll look forward to tomorrow. I believe Young Master Wushuang will shine brightly!”

Young Master Wushuang smiled, “This is my first time in the Eastern Desolation. I must depend on you guys if I want to be famous and gain a foothold here.”

Bai Yizhou, Zhang Kui, and Ye Qinghong exchanged a gaze with a smile. They roughly knew what Young Master Wushuang wanted to do now. He wanted to become famous by defeating the Eastern Desolation’s strongest holy land.

““That’s easy. We’ll also have to trouble Young Master Wushuang when we go to the Divine Dragon Empire!”” The trio replied.

The Dustless Palace was bustling with people the following day. The Dustless Palace was a forbidden ground of the Nether Orchid Courtyard, and no one dared to come here if there weren’t distinguished guests coming here.

A banquet was being held in the plaza before the Dustless Palace, and all the famous disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect were present. Many inner disciples also took the opportunity to come here to take a look at Young Master Wushuang.

After all, they had long heard of Young Master Wushuang from the musical clan. But this time, he came representing the Divine Dao Pavilion, and he came with many of the Divine Dao Pavilion’s disciples. Everyone knew that this so-called “exchange” was a competition between the younger generation of two sects.

There were similar exchanges occasionally, but they weren’t that popular. The Yulan Flower Festival was the one that would make everyone go into a frenzy because the six holy lands, including all the righteous and demonic sects within the Eastern Desolation, would be present.

But for this exchange, there were only disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect and the Divine Dao Pavilion. After all, youngsters were full of vigor and took the glory of their sects heavily. In the past, the Divine Dao Pavilion was the one who would lose.

This time, Young Master Wushuang was leading the team. Young Master Wushuang was a saint disciple of the Divine Dao Pavilion, and the Divine Dao Pavilion’s disciples wanted to take revenge for their past losses.

There were tables on the plaza, and the two sects’ disciples sat across from each other. The Nether Orchid Holy Maiden led the Heavenly Dao Sect’s corner, while Young Master Wushuang led the Divine Dao Pavilion’s corner.

Those qualified to be here were at least at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, but most of the people were at the sixth transformation in the Nirvana Stage. As for those at the seventh transformation, they were at the top of the pyramid here. Seeing anyone at the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage was a rare sight.

After all, saint disciples at the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage were mostly over fifty, and it was rare to see anyone under the age of fifty. An exchange between holy lands was usually held between younger generations and the older generation disciples would rarely be involved.

That was the same for the Divine Dao Pavilion, unless it was Yulan Flower Festival, where geniuses from the righteous and demonic sects were present.

Wang Yue, Chen Zhong, and Ouyang He sat together, trying to find Ye Qingtian within the crowd. Wang Yue muttered, “The Divine Dao Pavilion is already here, so where’s he? Don’t tell me he’s really trapped in there?”

“Who are you talking about?” Chen Zhong asked.

“Nothing.” Wang Yue forced out a smile.

When everyone was present, the banquet began after Bai Shuying welcomed the guests from the Divine Dao Pavilion.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Right then, Young Master Wushuang spoke out with a gentlemanly smile, “I have something to say!”

“Young Master Wushuang, you can just say what you want,” Bai Shuying replied courteously.

“Our two sects have a long history of exchanges. This is my first time here, and I wish to take this opportunity to present a song to the holy maiden,” Young Master Wushuang said confidently.

But when he said that, many people from the Heavenly Dao Sect frowned, and their enmity against the Young Master Wushuang grew. After all, Bai Shuying had many pursuers within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and they would join hands against an outsider like Young Master Wushuang.

“Sure enough, that fellow is here for the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden!”

“So what if he’s from a musical clan? Does he really think he’s worthy of the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden?”

“He’s so pretentious.” Many people muttered, and they looked at Young Master Wushuang with enmity.

“Hahaha! I have long heard Young Master Wushuang is an expert in music. So please, go on.” Bai Yizhou had interacted with Young Master Wushuang beforehand, so he naturally stood out ahead of Bai Shuying and agreed.

“I heard that the musical clan is qualified to play before the Empress,” Ye Qinghong smiled.

“Young Master Wushuang, I bet you’ve prepared for a long time,” Zhang Kui smiled.

Many Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples frowned as they looked at the three unhappily. These three were disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect, but they were helping the Divine Dao Pavilion instead.

Seeing this, Bai Shuying said, “Go on, then.”

Young Master Wushuang smiled and took out a zither. When he started playing, it was an ancient song that everyone knew, Lovesick.

His intention was evident because everyone could sense his infatuation for the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden in his music. Young Master Wushuang was pretty confident in his performance, and this ancient song had no difficulty.

So even if the Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples were unhappy, they had to admit Young Master Wushuang’s skills. Regardless of this song's intent, accuracy, and technique, it was perfect. Under Young Master Wushuang’s Saint Lord Tune, the song sounded ethereal, resounding in the sky.

When the song was over, everyone came to their senses with the likes of Wang Yue, wearing a grave expression, as they looked at Young Master Wushuang. They instantly realized that Young Master Wushuang wasn’t a pushover.

“Grass decays under the autumn wind, and where can I find it in the boundless world? It’s hard to extinguish lovesickness…” the Young Master Wushuang muttered before he smiled, “I hope you guys like my performance.”

Bai Shuying’s emotions fluctuated because of the song. She was also thinking about the person she loved and could only wait because she didn’t know where to find him.

“Young Master Wushuang, you deserve your reputation,” Bai Shuying said, and her voice was crisp like chipping jade.

“Holy Maiden, you’re too polite,” Young Master Wushuang smiled.

“It’s nothing impressive at all. I also know a bit or two about music dao. I wonder if Young Master Wushuang can give me some advice?” Someone from the Heavenly Dao Sect’s party stood out, looking at Young Master Wushuang, full of provocation.

When Wang Yue turned his head over, he saw that it came from Zhou Xu of the Holy Spirit Courtyard. The Holy Spirit Courtyard’s disciples were proficient in spiritual runes, so many were also proficient in music dao. Zhou Xu was the best amongst them, and he was unhappy when he saw Young Master Wushuang playing Lovesick. After all, wasn’t it the same as trying to snatch the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden from them by playing that publicly?

“Oh? You want an exchange?” Young Master Wushuang smiled.

“That’s right,” Zhou Xu said, his pupils filled with fighting spirits. He might be slightly inferior to Young Master Wushuang in music dao, but he was confident in his mental energy.

“He’s asking to be humiliated to compete with Young Master Wushuang in music dao. Doesn’t he know Young Master Wushuang comes from a musical clan?”

“I can’t believe there’s a fool like him in the Heavenly Dao Sect.”

“Haha.” The Divine Dao Pavilion’s disciples wore playful expressions with a hint of disdain in their pupils.

They were confident in Young Master Wushuang, and they believed that he could help the Divine Dao Pavilion obtain a victory against the Heavenly Dao Sect. In the end, the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden would be won over by Young Master Wushuang.

It didn’t take long for the exchange to take place. Many of the saint disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect were worried, and they were also impressed by his courage, despite knowing that Zhou Xu would most likely lose.

They might call it an “exchange”, but it was a spar. The music Zhou Xu played sounded like galloping horses on the battlefield, full of murderous intent. This instantly made everyone stunned because they didn’t really expect Zhou Xu to be proficient in music dao, and he had long grasped Saint Tune, playing a Warsong, the Azure Wolf’s Rage.

“Interesting…” Young Master Wushuang was stunned and played the same song as Zhou Xu. They both competed in their music, and the plaza seemed to have become a battlefield for them.

Two azure wolves were clashing with each other under the music, fighting fiercely and making everyone tensed up. But half an hour later, Zhou Xu had the upper hand because his wolf and the cavalry army charged at Young Master Wushuang.

His mental energy was strong, and he had already reached the twelfth-grade Saint Spiritualist. The phenomena created by his song easily destroyed Young Master Wushuang’s phenomena before charging at the latter.

“A futile attempt,” Young Master Wushuang smiled in disdain, allowing Zhou Xu’s phenomena to come at him and flicking his finger, playing a long tune. When the zither string trembled, golden radiance burst out from Young Master Wushuang, and his Saint Tune instantly reached Great Saint Tune.

Under the golden radiance, the phenomena created by Zhou Xu was swiftly being destroyed, and the strings of Zhou Xu’s zither snapped before he threw out a mouthful of blood, his face becoming pale. This made everyone’s faces change, and they realized that Young Master Wushuang didn’t give it his all earlier.

“Don’t embarrass yourself if this is the best you can do.” The Divine Dao Pavilion’s saint disciples mocked with disdain on their faces.

Bai Shuying’s face also changed, and she instantly realized that the Divine Dao Pavilion didn’t come with goodwill. The Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples were also naturally furious because they held great pride in the glory of the sect being the strongest sect within the Eastern Desolation.

They immediately got up on their feet and wanted to compete with Young Master Wushuang.

But Young Master Wushuang smiled and said, “There’s no need to hurry. We can play one at a time.”
