Chapter 2018 - Ancient Times

“Who did you see?” Lin Yun asked. The sword ray came from nowhere and beheaded the nine Blood Crow Kings. This was terrifying because not even someone at the Azure Origin Phase could accomplish it so easily. Even if someone at the Indigo Origin Phase could accomplish it, they could only accomplish it by using their full strength.

The Blood Crow Kings weren’t ordinary demonic beasts at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. In terms of cultivation, they were even more terrifying than some Quasi-Saints. They were only restricted and couldn’t step onto the saint path.

“I-I didn’t notice anything,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Kill!”

“The demon is too much! Kill him!”

With the death of the Blood Crow Kings, the Blood Crows were briefly shocked before they went insane. After all, how could they accept it when Lin Yun had nearly butchered the all of the Blood Crow Kings?

When Lin Yun saw this scene, he turned his gaze back to the Blood Crow Tribe and said, “Protect Bai Qingyu.”

There were too many of them. If all of them charged over at once, even a Quasi-Saint would be killed by them. But fortunately, the Blood Crows weren’t intelligent. So Lin Yun didn’t panic and said, “You stay here. I’ll lure these Blood Crows away.”

“Okay,” Lil’ Purple nodded.

As a radiance shone from her forehead, a murderous intent flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, and he released his Astral Sword Intent. He was enveloped in sword rays that formed into a light pillar that appeared to be ready to tear the sky apart.

“Kill!” Lin Yun immediately filled his entire body with nirvana aura and empowered his sword with Astral Sword Intent. When he swung his sword, a terrifying scene occurred. A sword ray pierced through space five hundred meters away and formed a terrifying spatial vortex.

As countless Blood Crows flocked over, blood and flesh began to rain down from the vortex. All the Blood Crows within a thousand meters were decimated as the ground became covered in blood. There were at least a few hundred Blood Crows who have died from this attack. This scene naturally made the rest of the Blood Crows to look at Lin Yun in horror because this guy wasn’t just a demon in their eyes, but a fiend god!

When he swung his sword, Lin Yun stomped his foot on the altar and flew away. The Blood Crows were briefly stunned before they immediately chased after Lin Yun. With that, the crisis around the altar was immediately resolved.

Although there were some leftovers, they were quickly dealt with by Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red before they could even get close. As for Lin Yun, he relied on the Golden Crow Wings to lead the Blood Crows around by their nose. He purposely released his Astral Sword Intent so that he would stand out, ensuring that the Blood Crows would see him wherever he was.

That sword from earlier had exhausted his nirvana aura and sword intent. So Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to kill them but relied on the Golden Crow Wings’ speed to lure them away. When he recovered from his exhaustion, he suddenly sped to the border of the secret realm, pulling away from the Blood Crows with a few dozen miles between them. He repeated what he did, pouring his Astral Sword Intent into the Flower Burial Sword with his aura restrained within his body.

“Go!” Lin Yun waved his hand. The Flower Burial Sword hovered in the air and flew forth, releasing a massive sword ray that was a few hundred feet long.

Lin Yun spread his arms and hid within an ancient tree. Fifteen minutes later, the Blood Crows chased after the Flower Burial Sword with boiling murderous intent.

“Kill that demon and take revenge for our ancestor and kings!”

“That demon has escaped! We can’t let him escape! Chase after him!”

“Chase after him! He must be running out of strength!”

After seeing the Blood Crows leave, Lin Yun smiled on a tree branch, watching the Blood Crows ‘chase’ after him. He had to admit that the Blood Crows’ intelligence was really low. “It actually worked!”

He turned into a streak of light and returned to the altar. When he returned, Lil’ Purple asked in a surprised tone, “You killed all the Blood Crows?”

“There are tens of thousands of them. How could I possibly kill them all? I lured them away with my sword. How’s Junior Sister Bai?” Lin Yun smiled.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Bai Qingyu was basking in saint radiance with her eyes closed. She slowly gave off an ancient aura that suppressed his Astral Sword Intent. The aura was mysterious, and he didn’t know if it was because of the Natal Yin Saint Physique or the Udumbara Flower.

“This is weird,” Lil’ Purple said. “Udumbara Flower seems to have connected with her mentality, and they’re fusing together.”

Lin Yun’s face changed because he quickly sensed that something was unusual. He asked, “Are they fusing, or is she being devoured?”

“I’m not sure,” Lil’ Purple said. “I’ve never encountered this situation before. After all, the Udumbara Flower is a legend in ancient times.”

“We have to go, now.” Lin Yun made a decision after a brief pondering. If the Udumbara Flower had intelligence, Bai Qingyu would be devoured if they fused. At that time, wouldn’t Bai Qingyu become a sacrificial item for the Udumbara Flower?

Although Lin Yun needed the Udumbara Flower, he didn’t want to exchange it for Bai Qingyu’s life.

“S-She’s not willing…” Lil’ Purple hesitated.

“Big Brother Ye, let me give it a try.” Bai Qingyu opened her eyes and said, “After the Udumbara Flower is refined, it will leave behind a seed.”

“It’s too risky, and I can’t take the bet.” Lin Yun didn’t like how this was going and stepped forth, wanting to grab Bai Qingyu by her shoulder. But the moment he came in contact with Bai Qingyu, he was sent flying away and threw out a mouthful of blood.

A powerful pressure swept out from the altar, catching Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red by surprise, sending them flying away. A floral fragrance came from the altar, and a light yellow flower appeared, emitting a saint radiance and aura.

Lin Yun, Lil’ Purple, and Lil’ Red felt at ease when the floral fragrance blew onto them. Lin Yun’s injuries were swiftly recovered, and the fragrance was nourishing his body. Looking at the flower, Lin Yun muttered, “The Udumbara Flower!”

The flower bloomed and enveloped Bai Qingyu within it.

“Damn it!” Lin Yun patted his forehead with regret filling his pupils. With a wave of his hand, a Sovereign Saint Artifact appeared. He resisted the saint aura as he charged at the altar.

The Celestial Vine that had previously fused into the ground appeared, and it was like a whip with a saint radiance lashing at Lin Yun.

“How dare you!” Lil’ Purple roared as the divine runes on her forehead bloomed. A short blade appeared in her hand as she blocked the vines. The surrounding air began to tremble as the blade clashed with the vines.

Lin Yun took this opportunity to land on the altar with the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella in his hand.

Bai Qingyu’s eyes were closed. She had isolated her senses from the outside world.

“This lass!” Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling heartache while looking at Bai Qingyu.

The floral fragrance on the altar was so dense that it formed into a golden mist. As Lin Yun walked in the mist, he looked at the Udumbara Flower, “Please stop and let me leave with her.”

“Isn’t she the sacrifice that you brought here?” A voice came from the Udumbara Flower.

Seeing that the Udumbara Flower was intelligent, Lin Yun instantly became alerted and replied, “No, she’s not.”

“Then why are you here?” The Udumbara Flower asked.

“I…” Lin Yun opened his mouth, but he couldn’t say a word. He was naturally here for the Udumbara Flower.

Seeing this, the Udumbara Flower instantly guessed why Lin Yun was here and replied, “You can leave. I’m not evil and won’t devour her if the sacrifice isn’t willing to fuse with me. When the fusion ends, I will leave behind a seed, and I can give it to you.”

Lin Yun turned to look at Bai Qingyu and couldn’t help feeling heartache for her. He tightened his grip on the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and firmly said, “I’m sorry, but I refuse.”

“Refuse? Do you know who you’re talking to?” The Udumbara Flower replied teasingly. As the Udumbara Flower raised its voice, a sacred aura swept out, “You’re talking with a deity!”

A deity? Lin Yun couldn’t think much about it and opened the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella before he roared, “Flower Burial!”

The aura from the Udumbara Flower sent Lin Yun flying away, and the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella almost flew from his hand. But the Flower Burial Sword flew over and stabbed the Udumbara Flower.

Golden liquid splashed out from the Udumbara Flower like blood. But just when the Flower Burial Sword was about to make a move, a few vines flew over and wrapped around the sword. The sky in the secret realm suddenly became dark, with a horrifying aura spreading out as though a deity had become enraged, causing cracks to appear within this secret realm. Even time seemed to have stopped.

Lil’ Purple and Lin Yun were immobilized under this terrifying aura and couldn’t move.

“I grant you death!” A calm voice came from the Udumbara Flower, containing torrential rage as lightning formed into a huge descending palm. The palm had a golden divine rune engraved on it, and cracks began to spread out on the ground as it descended. It looked as though this huge palm was suppressing this entire secret realm.

“That’s enough!” A voice resounded, and an old man appeared beneath the towering tree not too far away. The old man pointed with his finger, and time seemed to have been rewinded as the lightning palm disappeared from the sky. The Udumbara Flower also began to close into a bud.

“It’s really you!” Before Lin Yun could recover from his shock, Lil’ Purple flew into a rage when she saw the old man. This was the famous Iris Sword Saint who slew a deity while being at the Saint Realm in ancient times, and he was also the one who sealed her for a hundred thousand years.
