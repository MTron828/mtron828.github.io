Chapter 905 - Fall Out

Outside the Hidden Treasure Pavilion, many cultivators were waiting for Lin Yun, Chen Qiong, and Xian Yunzhen even after half a day had passed. It was rare to find such a complete pavilion in the Flamecloud City, so there was no question that there must be treasures inside.

But it was a pity that no one dared to enter. Many people were killed by the shockwave of Chen Qiong’s attack, so they were too terrified to do anything. With geniuses from the higher realms present, no one dared to move. But they stayed behind because they wanted to see if Lin Yun could come back alive.

In everyone’s view, Lin Yun was courting death to compete with the higher realm’s geniuses. But they didn’t want to leave until they witnessed Lin Yun’s death or else they would feel terrible. If Lin Yun died inside the Hidden Treasure Pavilion, they would be able to find a reason to comfort themselves. That was how bizarre people’s thoughts could be. They would feel relieved when they saw that others couldn’t do what they wanted.

However, Lin Yun appeared out of nowhere and started competing with the higher realm’s geniuses for treasures. If Lin Yun managed to live, they would feel regret.

Under this tense atmosphere, a figure suddenly flew out from the roof of the pavilion and landed on the ground.

“They’re out!”

“Someone is out!” The crowd became lively as they were curious who came out. Was it Chen Qiong or Xian Yunzhen? But when they saw Lin Yun, they were shocked.

“Profound Amber Realm’s Lin Yun!”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“How the hell is this possible?!”

“He actually survived with Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen around! How did he manage to do it?!” Everyone was completely dumbfounded when they saw this scene. A genius from the higher realms could easily sweep through any of the geniuses in Flamefeather City.

Geniuses from higher realms were terrifying devils in everyone’s hearts. However, Lin Yun managed to come out alive, which destroyed the invincible image that everyone had regarding higher realm geniuses.

Just when everyone was shocked, two more figures flew out from the Hidden Treasure Pavilion’s roof. Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen came to stop Lin Yun.

“You want to leave after taking everything from the Hidden Treasure Pavilion?”

“You’re pretty quick at running. Do you really think you can escape?” Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen surged with uncontrollable killing intent as they looked at Lin Yun. Their origin energy surged violently into the surroundings.

But when everyone in the surroundings heard what Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen said, they were completely shocked. Lin Yun swept through all of the treasures in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion? No wonder Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were so furious.

“Lin Yun isn’t afraid of death?” Everyone took a deep breath and felt a chill run down their spines. Not only did Lin Yun compete with the geniuses from higher realms, he even took all the treasures in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion. If news of this got out, Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen would be thoroughly embarrassed.

“You two are stupid. The treasures in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion didn't have an owner, so don’t make it sound like I robbed you.” Lin Yun looked at Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen calmly with no fear in his eyes. Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were starting to get on his nerves.

Chen Qiong wanted to test his strength and he would have died if he wasn’t careful. Then there was Xian Yunzhen. Xian Yunzhen tried to play tricks on him to put him in a disadvantageous position. Did they really think he was a pushover?

As he spoke, a Heavenly Soul Realm aura was released from Lin Yun that easily resolved Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen’s pressure. He wasn’t afraid of them when he was in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm, so he wouldn’t be afraid after reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm.

“So you made a breakthrough. No wonder you’re so courageous. But you’re still nothing before me. Hand over the treasures you took from the Hidden Treasure Pavilion!” Chen Qiong barked and made the first move. He already lost in his exchange with Lin Yun, so he wanted to teach Lin Yun a lesson. He wanted Lin Yun to know that he was inferior to the geniuses from the higher realms!

As Chen Qiong soared into the sky, terrifying flames burst out of his body and shot towards Lin Yun. Holding nothing back, he pushed his second stage flame intent to the limit as his aura crashed down on Lin Yun like a bright sun.

“You’re courting death!” Lin Yun's eyes flashed coldly. Clearly, he needed to teach Chen Qiong a lesson.

Circulating both sword sutras, Lin Yun felt the aura ocean in his violet palace boil as he threw a punch. He wanted to see if there was a gap between him and the geniuses from the higher realms after reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm.

When the two punches collided, the ground beneath Lin Yun and Chen Qiong cracked. Additionally, a shockwave sent dust and rubble into the air.

The two had no change on their faces and continued to clash as the cracks spread out to a few thousand meters. In that split second, Chen Qiong and Lin Yun had exchanged over a dozen moves.

Sensing the turbulence in his body and his entire arm becoming numb, Chen Qiong was shocked, “How is this possible?!”

He couldn’t believe that he couldn’t suppress a Heavenly Soul Realm who hadn’t gone through tribulation when he was a genius from a higher realm who had gone through his tribulation. By logic, he should have suppressed Lin Yun since he was from the higher realms.

However, Lin Yun was fighting him evenly without having to use spiritual sword intent. Incredibly, Lin Yun had a slight advantage in their fight. Lin Yun wasn’t this strong before!

The other cultivators from Glorysun Land were completely dumbfounded when they saw this scene. The Profound Amber Realm was essentially a lower realm, so how was he evenly matched with Chen Qiong? It made no sense that Lin Yun could fight Chen Qiong so easily after reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm.

“Is this all you got? I’m just starting to warm up,” grinned Lin Yun. An Azure Firmament Tree appeared behind him with Iris Flowers on the branches. At this moment, he had brought out his spiritual sword intent at greater mastery.

A brilliant sword hum echoed out as Lin Yun’s punch was at least two times stronger than before. Chen Qiong was already sent flying by Lin Yun’s brilliant sword intent even before Lin Yun threw a punch.

When Chen Qiong landed on the ground, Lin Yun’s punch had reached him. Chen Qiong’s face changed and he no longer held back. He roared, “Violet Purgatory Demonic Fist!”

The famous fortune martial technique of the Violetyang Realm appeared once more. But using it in a hurry couldn’t resolve Lin Yun’s attack, so Chen Qiong was pushed back.

Just as Lin Yun was about to chase after Chen Qiong, a cold palm flew towards him from his back. The attack was like a venomous python waiting for Lin Yun to reveal his flaw. The palm had naturally come from Xian Yunzhen who had been waiting for the right opportunity.

“It’s over!” snickered Xian Yunzhen. No matter how strong Lin Yun was, Lin Yun was only in the Heavenly Soul Realm. He believed that he could cripple Lin Yun with this palm.
