Chapter 2089: Demoness

The Serene Dust Great Saint didn’t enter the Sacred Alliance’s city with Lin Yun. She had to join up with the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. So Lin Yun entered the Sacred Alliance’s city after bidding farewell to her.

The Sacred Alliance was an ancient force within the Kunlun Realm, and they maintained neutrality for a long time, maintaining contact with both the righteous and demonic factions. Aside from fiends who caused chaos in the Kunlun Realm in the past, the Sacred Alliance’s resources were opened to the righteous and demonic factions.

Lin Yun didn’t have much relationship with the Sacred Alliance. The only person he was familiar with was the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord from the Ancient Barren Domain. But they didn’t have a deep relationship because they didn’t know each other that well.

Thus, Lin Yun didn’t stay long at the Sacred Alliance. He retrieved his medal as the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s disciple, requesting the Sacred Alliance to activate the teleportation array to send him back to the Heavenly Dao Sect.

The teleportation arrays that could travel between domains were built in ancient times, and they required a large sum of saint crystals every time they were activated. Lin Yun naturally had no saint crystals and could only let the Sacred Alliance mark it on the Heavenly Dao Sect’s account.

He was now a famous figure throughout the Kunlun Realm, and the Sacred Alliance was well-informed. They naturally knew of his achievements, so they wouldn’t make things difficult for him. When the teleportation array was activated, Lin Yun was safely returned to the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“We’re finally back. This journey to the Hidden Sword Manor wasn’t easy,” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the Iris Secret Realm.

“It’s still all right, but it’s a pity…” Lin Yun muttered.

“Hehe. You probably won’t be able to receive your rewards as the champion of the Sword Assembly now,” Lil’ Purple smiled. She naturally knew what he felt pity about.

Lin Yun felt helpless because he was too anxious to return with the Sovereign Saint Sword and couldn’t wait in Nether Ethereal City for long. It was just as he had expected because the teleportation array was destroyed that night.

But it was fortunate that he completed his mission and even made a breakthrough to the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. His battle with Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan gave Lin Yun a complete understanding of his current strength. In that battle, he had exerted all his available trump cards and forced out his full potential.

“What do you plan to do next?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Rest for a day and look for the Dao Yang Holy Son. I have to enter the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda,” Lin Yun said in a deep voice. The tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage was important to him. Although he failed in trying to make a breakthrough once, it gave him a lot of valuable experience.

His breakthrough couldn’t be considered a failure because he voluntarily gave up at the last moment. The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was the Heavenly Dao Sect's space and time treasure. Aside from slowing down time within the pagoda, many ancient inheritances and resources existed.

After fighting with a Quasi-Saint, Lin Yun was eager to improve his strength. Regardless of Feng Shaoyu or Quasi-Saint Tian Yuan, they couldn’t be truly regarded as formidable Quasi-Saints at the Indigo Origin Phase.

His?opponents were geniuses of the golden generation, the holy sons, and holy maidens from the various holy lands. Those people?would generally grasp the great dao upon entering the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm.

There were three thousand great daos and countless lesser daos. There was a huge difference between great daos and lesser daos. According to Su Ziyao, an Indigo Origin Phase that had grasped a great dao could easily crush someone who only grasped a lesser dao, and they could easily face a hundred opponents of that level. There might be some exaggeration in her words, but the truth shouldn’t be that far away.

Lin Yun could sense that if he grasped the sword dao, he only needed one sword to face those Quasi-Saints who’ve grasped lesser daos. The geniuses of the golden generation would master greater daos or even sovereign daos. This was why Su Ziyao asked him to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm quickly.

But it wasn’t because Lin Yun didn’t?want?to make a breakthrough, but ever since he reached the limits at the Empyrean, Elysium Core, and Dragon Pulse Realms, he naturally wanted to try to reach the limits of the Nirvana Stage. If he could succeed, his physique would reach a state of perfection before the saint path.

“It’s terrifying, even in ancient times, to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm after achieving the four limits. You can be considered a peerless genius at that time,” Lil’ Purple said.

“After you reach the Quasi-Saint Realm, there’s another limit. You can only be considered peerless after achieving five extremes. I speculate that the Nine Emperors have reached it. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be considered myths.” Lil’ Purple initially felt disdainful about the Nine Emperors, but her evaluation changed after understanding more about them.

“What’s the advantage of reaching the limits?” Lin Yun asked.

“Isn’t it obvious? If you didn’t possess the foundation of three limits, can you fight a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase while being at the Nirvana Stage? It’s impossible to solely rely on your sword intent alone. After reaching the Saint Realm, the foundation of reaching the limits will be revealed, and you can even fight those with a divine physique,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun’s eyes shone brightly. He didn’t run into anyone with a divine physique, but the saint physiques he encountered were strong. As he was chatting with Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun walked towards Indigothunder Peak.

When the disciples met Lin Yun along the way, they had respect on their faces because Ye Qingtian had now become an influential figure within the Heavenly Dao Sect. But the Southern Border was too far, so his achievements at the Sword Assembly hadn’t been spread yet. This was why the disciples were only respectful and weren’t too emotional.

But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by that and went into seclusion after returning to Indigothunder Peak to digest the harvest he had obtained so far. He had maintained this habit for a long time and would digest the gains of each great battle. So even if Lin Yun didn’t obtain the rewards for the Sword Assembly, the battles would be enough to greatly benefit him.

An unexpected visitor visited him three days later, but it wasn’t the Dao Yang Holy Son. This unexpected visitor was naturally the Heavenly Yin Maiden, Wang Muyan.

“Junior Brother Ye is really low profile, becoming the champion of the Sword Assembly without anyone realizing it. Not to mention that you have even managed to borrow a Sovereign Saint Sword!” Wang Muyan was bewitching and had a voluptuous figure.

“Why are you here?” Lin Yun knew Wang Muyan’s purpose but still deliberately asked.

“You already know why I’m here,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Lin Yun continued, pretending not to know.

Wang Muyan dropped her smile and coldly said, “Stop pretending. Are you going to undo the Nether Shackles?!”

“I can undo it for you, but tell me all your secrets and where a Demonspirit like Xiao Jingyan came from,” Lin Yun replied.

“Xiao Jingyan was a Demonspirit? This is important, and you have to report it immediately,” Wang Muyan said with a grave expression.

She doesn’t know about it??Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, and he couldn’t judge if she really didn’t know about Xiao Jingyan’s identity or if she was pretending not to know.

No, Wang Muyan was just too cautious, and she definitely knew that Xiao Jingyan was a Demonspirit. But the relationship between them was unknown. After all, Wang Muyan was mysterious, and she must have had an ulterior motive for endlessly wanting to obtain the Solar Lunar Divine Rune.

There was nothing Lin Yun could do to her for the time being, but he wasn’t in a hurry because she would expose herself sooner or later. Lin Yun replied, “I’m just casually talking about it.”

“It looks like you’ve become bad, and you’ve learned how to try and probe my words. You can ask me what you want, and I’ll satisfy you,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“You can’t give me what I want,” Lin Yun said.

Wang Muyan smiled coquettishly. Her smile was enchanting as she approached and said, “Don’t be so sure about that. I roughly know what you sought, that Sovereign Saint Sword. A Sovereign Saint Sword is lacking if you want to protect the Radiant Sword Saint. You have no idea how terrifying Tian Xuanzi’s background is, but I’m not afraid of him.”

Lin Yun’s hand swiftly reached out, aiming for Wang Muyan’s throat.

Wang Muyan seemed to have expected this and slipped away. Her eyes shone brightly as she hovered in mid-air, and she smiled, “Ye Qingtian, why do you have to work so hard? I have a rough guess of your identity, and you would’ve died if I didn’t take an interest in you.”

She wasn’t lying because she was rather fond of Ye Qingtian and wanted to recruit Ye Qingtian under her.

“It looks like you’ve found a way to break the Nether Shackles.” Lin Yun looked at Wang Muyan and had his speculation. After all, Wang Muyan had gotten stronger than before.

“Why don’t you guess?” Wang Muyan winked. “Oh, don’t bother looking for the Dao Yang Holy Son. He had left for the God Burial Mountain Range before you had returned. I forgot to tell you that he has stayed in the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda for three years and is now a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase.”

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised because even Feng Shaoyu could reach the Indigo Origin Phase, not to mention the Dao Yang Holy Son. But the Dao Yang Holy Son was already so powerful before reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm. Now that he had reached the Indigo Origin Phase, he had probably gotten much stronger than before. It looked like all the geniuses were making their last preparations before the Blue Dragon Record appearance.

“Wait, the God Burial Mountain Range’s seal has weakened again?” Lin Yun asked.

“You’re smart,” Wang Muyan smiled. The God Burial Mountain Range’s seal has weakened again, and Quasi-Saints can now enter it. One day, even Saint Realm experts can enter.”

Wang Muyan’s eyes were blazing with flames and seemed concerned about the God Burial Mountain Range.

“An ancient forbidden ground was discovered within the God Burial Mountain Range, containing the inheritance of an Emperor Realm expert. The Eastern Desolation’s six holy lands have joined forces to investigate, and each holy land only has five quotas.” Wang Muyan shook her head and sighed, “It’s too much of a pity for you to lose this opportunity because of the Sword Assembly. Even the six holy lands couldn’t contain this information and had to give some quotas to the other holy lands and saint clans from other domains. You can only obtain a reputation at the Sword Assembly, and I’ve heard that you didn’t even receive the rewards for it.”

Lin Yun frowned and asked, “What are you trying to say?”

Wang Muyan smiled, “The Blue Dragon Record will soon appear, and everyone already knows about it. If you don’t reach the Quasi-Saint Realm, you’ll miss this opportunity, and the gap between you and them will increase. Why are you so persistent? Undo the Nether Shackles for me; I’ll give you what you need. Isn’t that a benefit on both sides?”

“You can’t give me what I want,” Lin Yun said.

Wang Muyan wasn’t furious when she heard that. She smiled, “How would you know if you don’t give it a try? Ye Qingtian, many people are fond of me, but I only have you?in my heart. This is why I’m so forgiving towards you.”

Her face was charming, and she gave off an outburst of fragrance when she said that.

“Ye Qingtian, take your time to consider it. Come and look for me if you have a change of mind, and I can give you what you want,” Wang Muyan revealed with a mysterious smile before she left. There was something weird about her; she didn’t look the same as she did during their last meeting.

Lin Yun had a speculation that it might have something to do with the weakening seal within the God Burial Mountain Range, but he didn’t have any evidence to back it up.

“Scumbag, don’t tell me you’ve fallen for her?” Lil’ Purple asked with her cheeks puffed up.

“How can that be?” Lin Yun continued, “Empress, help me keep an eye on her. Don’t let her discover you; I feel that she’s scheming something.”

“Hmph, that’s more like it. I have plenty of ways to deal with her.” Lil’ Purple was confident and didn’t place Wang Muyan in her eyes.

“Don’t take matters into your own hands. Come and find me if you discover anything,” Lin Yun said.

“Don’t worry. How can a demoness possibly injure me?” Wang Muyan was already getting on Lil’ Purple’s nerves. After hearing what Lin Yun said, she made some preparations before leaving with Lil’ Red.

“It looks like I can’t delay reaching the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage anymore.” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because what Wang Muyan said made him feel some pressure.
