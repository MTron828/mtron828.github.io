Chapter 909 - Attention From All Sides

All the cultivators in the Flamefeather City were excited when they saw the phenomena created by the Glorysun Spirit. In a dark swamp, Feng Wuji wiped the blood off his blade without any care for the pile of bodies next to him. Far away, someone was running for their life in panic with a fruit in his hand.

But Feng Wuji didn’t look to be in a hurry as he slowly cleaned his blade. This low grade dao artifact was his greatest reliance in the Azure Dragon Region and represented his strength.

Those who didn’t have the strength to protect their treasure would be killed in the Heavenly Path. Feng Wuji cleaned his blade as if the one who was escaping with his treasure wouldn’t be able to outrun him. Suddenly, Feng Wuji stopped cleaning his blade and looked at the direction of the phenomena.

“The Glorysun Spirit has finally appeared!” Feng Wuji was briefly stunned before his eyes flashed with excitement. He was starting to get bored in Flamefeather City since everything had been a one-sided massacre. He couldn’t even find someone to train his skills with.

“Mo Han, Chen An, and Shi Feng, you must be seeing this as well, right? Don’t bore me. It’ll be too boring if I’m the only one who goes after the Glorysun Spirit.” Feng Wuji wore a cold smile like a beast baring its fangs.

Suddenly, Feng Wuji recalled the ant that ran away. Sheathing his blade, he recalled that he killed many people for a treasure called the Blood Sun Fruit. It was a decent fruit that was a few thousand years old. But he ultimately gave up on it and decided to put it aside for now.

Looking in the direction of the phenomena, Feng Wuji’s pupils flashed with killing intent.

That black figure had already run far away and he didn’t dare to relax even after sensing that the killing intent behind him had dissipated. He ran for an entire hour before he removed his mask and gasped for air. It was Liu Yun, a genius from the Highcloud Realm who had also comprehended the spiritual sword intent.

“Feng Wuji is so terrifying… The geniuses from higher realms are too scary. They’re a lot stronger than the geniuses from other realms.” Liu Yun’s back was covered with sweat as he recalled how Feng Wuji cut through everyone like weeds.

But when he looked at the fruit in his hand, he couldn’t help getting excited. He was holding a 3,000 year old Blood Sun Fruit. A fruit of this age was rare in lower realms, and he could only find one in the Heavenly Path. So what if Feng Wuji was ranked right below the Azure Dragon Ranking? He still got the Blood Sun Fruit in the end!

Liu Yun felt the achievement of stealing the Blood Sun Fruit from Feng Wuji. After he stored it, he muttered to himself, “He shouldn’t have seen my face. With the Glorysun Spirit’s emergence, I should gather with the senior brothers before searching for other opportunities.”

In a damaged pavilion, Mo Han was checking his harvest with excitement. There were many treasures in the Flamefeather City that could excite a genius from a higher realm like him. His harvest made the journey to Flamefeather City worth it.

His face was pale and gave off an eerie temperament. If someone looked at him from afar, Mo Han’s appearance would give them immense pressure. He was also just as strong as Feng Wuji. So with the phenomena caused by the Glorysun Spirit’s emergence, Mo Han immediately squinted his eyes.

“It’s appearing already? I thought it would take a few more days…” Mo Han locked his brows together. Unlike Feng Wuji, he had no interest in the Glorysun Spirit. In fact, he was more interested in the treasures that he could find. But it was a pity that the senior brother of his realm had instructed him to bring back the Glorysun Spirit at all cost.

“Treasures might be good, but the Glorysun Spirit is more important. There must also be treasures near the emergence of the Glorysun Spirit,” grinned Mo Han. Picking up his halberd, Mo Han swiftly disappeared.

Two figures were traveling on a sand dune when they turned to look at the phenomena in the sky. It was Shi Feng and Chen An from the Nethercloud Realm. They were also from the higher realms and both of them had a dao artifact. Individually, they were slightly weaker than Mo Han and Feng Wuji. But together, they were just as strong, if not stronger.

Because of their team work, they acted arrogantly. They didn’t even place some geniuses from higher realms in their eyes.

“No one is worthy of our attention aside from Mo Han and Feng Wuji. Unfortunately, they aren’t easy to deal with,” sighed Shi Feng. “It won’t be easy for us to take the Glorysun Spirit.”

“It’s one of the keys to unlock the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, so why would it be easy? We ultimately have a higher chance with us working together though,” smiled Chen An.

“You’re right. They should be taught a lesson for their arrogance!” Shi Feng’s eyes flashed coldly. Clearly, none of the four geniuses had a good relationship. After all, they were competitors who wanted to make it into the Azure Dragon Ranking.

“Let’s go!” The two chatted briefly before they charged towards the direction of the phenomena.

At the same time, the other geniuses from the higher realms rushed towards the phenomena. It wouldn’t take long before everyone gathered at the birthplace of the Glorysun Spirit.

At the very least, all of the higher realms would be present, which meant a brutal fight was approaching. Even the fight for the treasures would be brutal.

As for Lin Yun, he still wasn’t in a hurry. The first thing he needed to finish was suppressing the negative effects of the Millennium Flame before moving out. He was pretty far from the Glorysun Spirit and it would take at least half a day if he travelled at full speed. Furthermore, he would be courting death if he didn’t have enough strength.

With many geniuses gathered in Flamefeather City, Lin Yun could see a large number of people travelling in the same direction. An hour later, Lin Yun arrived on a sand dune. When he raised his head, he saw that he wasn’t too far from the Glorysun Spirit’s birthplace anymore. Vaguely, he could sense the blazing fire energy.

In front of him was a brutal battle where two Glorysun Land’s geniuses were ganging up on one person. The three of them weren’t weak as all of them had reached the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

Usually, when Lin Yun saw something like this in the Flamefeather City, he would ignore them. But now, it would be difficult for him to ignore them. The one getting ganged up on was Chen Xuan from the Highcloud Realm. The other two were Flowlight City’s Pei Yu and Leng Yue.

He still remembered how Chen Xuan and Pei Yu fought in the Flamefeather Mountain Range. In that confrontation, Chen Xuan held the upper hand. However, it was only one move, so it was hard to tell who would win in a real fight. For Chen Xuan, Pei Yu was enough to give him a headache, not to mention the addition of Leng Yue. There was no way Chen Xuan could fight them both.

Chen Xuan was already covered with injuries and couldn’t even find an opportunity to escape. No matter how he looked at it, Chen Xuan was his companion, so he had to help him.

“Chen Xuan, weren’t you arrogant back in the Flamefeather Mountain Range?” mocked Pei Yu when he saw Chen Xuan’s pathetic state.

“Is there any meaning for you guys to assault me over an ordinary fortune martial technique?” Chen Xuan asked with a dark face. Pei Yu and Leng Yue were really shameless. Not only did they gang up on him, but they even started mocking him.

If he didn’t suffer an assault, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to escape even if the two worked together. But now, it would be a problem for him to escape. While they spoke, Chen Xuan took a sword to his chest and was sent flying away.

“Sorry, but this is pretty fun. Hahaha!” Pei Yu started laughing with a ferocious light flashing across his eyes.

“Cut the crap and kill him. We still have to rush to the Glorysun Spirit,” said Leng Yue. When Pei Yu sent Chen Xuan flying out, he timed his attack and threw a punch at Chen Xuan’s chest. There was no doubt that Chen Xuan would be killed if he took this attack head-on.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun descended from the sky and his punch hit Leng Yue. This caught Leng Yue by surprise and sent him flying. When he raised his head to see Lin Yun, he was greatly shocked. Pei Yu had to rush to his side to help him out.

“Lin Yun?” Chen Xuan was surprised to see Lin Yun helping him.

In response, Lin Yun merely smiled and nodded his head. If Chen Xuan’s eyes weren’t messing with him, he just saw Lin Yun punch Leng Yue. A single punch was all Lin Yun needed to send Leng Yue flying. But when he noticed that Lin Yun had reached the Heavenly Soul Realm, his eyes quickly flashed with excitement. He knew that he was saved.

“Lin Yun, let’s retreat. They aren’t easy to deal with. We should group up with everyone else before getting our revenge.” Chen Xuan was rather calm. With Lin Yun around, it wouldn’t be a problem for them to escape. But trying to defeat the two of them would be a problem.

“You guys want to come and go as you wish? Dream on!” Leng Yue wiped the blood off his lips with killing intent surging in his pupils.

“No one can leave?” Lin Yun said indifferently. “I just so happen to share the same thoughts. The two of you should be buried here instead.”

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly because he wanted to see how strong he became after drinking the Millennium Flame.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
