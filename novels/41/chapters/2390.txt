Chapter 2391 - Gathering

The flute music continued on the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage with various phenomena forming and gathering on Yue Weiwei, forming into a beautiful dress, the legendary Ni Chang Dress.

As the flute music echoed throughout the Heavenly Saint Courtyard, everyone was captivated by the music and dance. Yue Weiwei was breathtaking, to begin with. With the Ni Chang Dress, this only made her dance even more outstanding.

“How beautiful!” Xia Qingyun sighed at this scene.

The music was beautiful, and the dance was even more attractive. Just like that, Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei joined forces, and the ninety-eight people couldn’t get close.

“They’re a perfect match,” Xia Qingyun said.

On the throne, Luo Tianxi wore an expression of admiration with a smile. Everyone was asking why Yue Weiwei and Lin Yun could be together, and they were jealous of Lin Yun. But this was because they experienced countless life and death situations together.

“So the rumor is true!” Ji Zixi became excited when she looked at the performance. It was rumored that Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei joined forces to perform a dance and song during the Nirvana Banquet, which let the Three-Lives Tree bloom.

Lin Jiangxian was also stunned, before she muttered, “Young Master Lin is really unique.”

Xiong Tiannan became emotional as though he was the one on the stage, and exclaimed, “Holy shit!”

Ao Jue couldn’t help smiling, but there was nothing he could say about it. These people asked why; he could only say that the Ni Chang Dress Song was enough to prove the relationship between Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei.

When the song finished, Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei were the only ones standing on the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage. Yue Weiwei turned back with a smile before the seven-colored dress disappeared.

Profound Sky Venerable was shocked. But just when he was about to announce their victory, Luo Tianxi stood up from his seat, and looked at Lin Yun with admiration, “Flower Burial, nice song!”

“Thank you, Emperor,” Lin Yun smiled after a brief stun.

“I heard from Profound Sky Venerable how you performed on the ninth testing ground,” Luo Tianxi smiled.

Lin Yun smiled but said nothing else.

“Profound Sky Venerable said that you’re a peerless prodigy swordsman, but it’s a pity that I didn’t see you use your sword,” Luo Tianxi smiled.

His words caused an uproar because the peerless prodigy swordsman was the same as a Sword Dao legend. But if that was the case, there should be phenomena that accompanied it. But no one could believe it since everyone here was a genius, and there was no lack of prodigy swordsmen amongst them.

“There will be a chance,” Lin Yun said.

“I look forward to it, and so is my master,” Luo Tianxi smiled. He looked at Yue Weiwei, and said, “Yue Weiwei.”

“I’m here,” Yue Weiwei smiled.

Looking at Yue Weiwei seriously, Luo Tianxi said, “You’re the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden, and my master has already made arrangements for you. Regardless of your performance, you can become his direct disciple. This is my master’s respect for the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain.”

“It’s an honor for the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain,” Yue Weiwei smiled.

But their conversation caused an uproar that was even greater than Luo Tianxi’s evaluation of Lin Yun. Many came here competing to become the ancestral deity’s disciples, but Yue Weiwei was already accepted before the outcome.

Luo Tianxi said nothing else and slowly sat down. The nearby ancestral deity’s disciples turned to look at Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei curiously; they were curious about this couple. One was evaluated as a peerless prodigy swordsman by an Emperor, while the ancestral deity already accepted the other as his disciple.

Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei exchanged a smile before they left the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage holding hands.

The banquet continued as countless geniuses stood out, showing everyone the meaning of peerless geniuses. The battles made many people’s blood boil, and soon the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son also went on stage.

Lin Yun finally knew why the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was so popular at the Heavenly Barren Banquet. After all, the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son grasped one of the Eternal Daos—Space Dao!

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was unbelievably powerful with his Space Dao, making Lin Yun recall Ye Guhan and Tian Xuanzi.

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son didn’t even use his constellation to suppress everyone. When he made his move, space would distort into a spatial vortex, and the outcome of those people swept into it was pitiful. Then again, the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son held back to display his excellent control over Space Dao. If he had poor control over Space Dao, those people would only be dead.

There were also Saint Spiritualists who drew ninth-grade Saint Runes or created a diagram with a wave of their hand. Lin Yun had practiced the art of spiritual runes before, and he was shocked after witnessing those Saint Spiritualists’ means. But it was fortunate that he gave up spiritual runes soon after because the Kunlun Realm was lacking when compared to the three thousand realms.

There were also geniuses proficient in music, using the Saint King Tune that created a grand phenomenon. Several swordsmen left a deep impression on Lin Yun and even made him feel slightly afraid.

According to Lin Jiangxian, those people were all in their eighties, and they cultivated longer than Lin Yun. Not to mention that they were geniuses, to begin with. But the Heavenly Barren Banquet was only open to those under a hundred years old, which showed what Lin Yun lacked: time.

When the last battle finally came to an end, there were only two hundred people who managed to go to the next round, which would take place tomorrow. Some people were ferocious and only cared about shining brightly on the banquet, clearing the entire stage.

When Luo Tianxi stood up, he announced the end of the banquet, which would resume tomorrow. After he left, a youth beside Ye Wuhen and Xia Qingyun stood up. This person was Feng Bumao, a direct disciple of the ancestral deity and could be considered the Heavenly Saint Courtyard’s holy son.

The thirty-six courtyards in Heaven’s Gate have a holy son each, and the Heavenly Saint Courtyard had the highest position.

“Don’t be in a hurry to leave. There will be a gathering to host everyone tonight, so please participate.” Feng Bumao smiled, giving an invitation to everyone. He was the Heavenly Saint Courtyard’s holy son, and the gathering was held here. So, he naturally had to host everyone.

People like the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son already knew there would be a gathering, so he cupped his fists together and expressed his gratitude.

“Big Brother Lin, do you want to go?” Yue Weiwei asked.

Lin Yun didn’t want to go, since he would receive mockery if he was there. But just when he was about to leave, Xia Qingyun and Ye Wuhan flew over. One was the most beautiful woman of Heaven’s Gate, while the other was the most talented genius and the youngest disciple of the ancestral deity. So many people wondered if he could become the Heaven’s Gate Divine Son, the youngest divine son in history.

“Greetings, Senior Brother Ye and Senior Sister Ye.” Xi Yuan was shocked and didn’t dare to delay her greetings. She was a disciple of Heaven’s Gate and knew their status within the sect.

Xia Qingyun nodded, then looked at Lin Yun with a smile, “Flower Burial, please give me face and attend the gathering tonight.”

Her smile was bright and beautiful. She continued, “I have long heard of Flower Burial’s name, and even my master mentioned you frequently. He has paid attention to your performance in the Heavenly Barren Realm.”

Lin Yun was surprised that the ancestral deity paid attention to him.

Xia Qingyun smiled, “No need to find it weird. Our master is friends with the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity, and he has long calculated your connection with the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity. So it’s hard not to take note of you.”

She didn’t just invite Lin Yun, but invited the rest as well. On the contrary, Ye Wuhen was calm as he observed Lin Yun and fell into deep thoughts. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“I do want to go, but the sect master probably drew a lot of hatred for me with his words,” Lin Yun smiled.

“So, you’re afraid?” Ye Wuhen smiled. “You can just give whoever dares to question you a beating, and this is the path of a genius. I have also received more doubts than you.”

He was younger than Lin Yun, and he was arrogant, judging from his words.

“Don’t listen to him. There won’t be a fight at the gathering, so you don’t have to worry about it,” Xia Qingyun smiled.

Ye Wuhen sneered, before he continued, “I’m not bullshitting. The sect master said he was a peerless swordsman, but he didn’t even use a single sword. So it’s hard for him not to be doubted. I also know how to use the sword, so I can’t see how you’re a prodigy swordsman.”

Lin Jiangxian’s face became cold, before she said, “That’s because you’re not worthy.”

Sensing the chill, Ye Wuhen’s heart trembled, so he smiled, “You want to fight?”

“Anytime,” Lin Jiangxian said fearlessly.

Lin Yun smiled. Lin Jiangxian’s temper was the same as her sword, fearless. But there was no need for them to fight, so he stopped Lin Jiangxian before looking at Ye Wuhen with a smile, “A fight can save a lot of trouble, but it’s also troublesome. The flowing water doesn't vie to be first; what it contends for is its unceasing abundance. You’re still young, and naturally, you won’t think that way.”

The flowing water doesn't vie to be first; what it contends for is its unceasing abundance?

Ye Wuhen was stumped with unhappiness on his face. But Lin Yun didn’t care about him, and turned to Xia Qingyun, “Alright. I will go to the gathering, so please lead the way.”

Ye Wuhen’s face became dark. Why did Lin Yun want Xia Qingyun to lead the way when Xi Yuan was here?

But Xia Qingyun didn’t mind, and smiled, “Xi Yuan, you can leave first. I’ll bring Young Master Lin and his companions to the gathering.”

Xi Yuan didn’t dare to refuse an order from Xia Qingyun, but she was deeply shocked in her heart.
