Chapter 1729 – Ancient Dragon Tendons

“He succeeded?” Mu Xueling carried her lute as she looked at Lin Yun. The light shining on Lin Yun’s chest was a blazing sword intent like an erupting volcano. This was a sign that Lin Yun had grasped the Sword Heart, but it was too fast!

The Sword Heart was hard to grasp, and even saints who possessed the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent might not grasp it. Lin Yun grasped the Sword Heart, so he could become a Sword Saint when he reached the Sword Realm and not just a saint who uses the sword. There was a massive difference between the two.

But it would depend on Lin Yun’s fortune if he could obtain the same title as his master and become one of the three great Sword Saints of the Eastern Desolation.

“He’s ultimately a swordsman.” Mu Xueling found it a pity because Lin Yun was also talented in music dao. If he worked hard, there was a high possibility that he might grasp the Imperial Tone in the future or even the Divine Dragon Tone.

“Saint Elder, I’ve succeeded.” Lin Yun opened his eyes, and the light dissipated and swept back to his heart. His eyes were filled with child-like excitement.

As Lin Yun shook his arms, he landed before Mu Xueling. The joy on his face was like water overflowing from a cup and even infected Mu Xueling.

“Grasping the Sword Heart is only the first step. You still have to work hard. When you achieve the seventh-grade sword intent, you can try to grasp the Sword Domain. This is…” Mu Xueling said.

But before she could finish, Lin Yun finished for her with a smile, “Written on the book.”

“Yeah, written in the book.” Mu Xueling replied.

Lin Yun’s smile grew denser because he suddenly realized Mu Xueling was pretty adorable when she was serious.

“Saint Elder, why are you hiding your true appearance?” Lin Yun couldn’t help asking. After grasping the Sword Heart, it was the same as having an inner eye. This meant that the disguise Mu Xueling did to her appearance could no longer stop him.

“I can’t?” Mu Xueling replied with another question.

“Uhh… You can.” Lin Yun said.

Mu Xueling no longer dwelled in it, and she changed the topic, “I will teach the complete Nine Lotus Art. I roughly know why the Nine Lotus Diagram wants to follow you now; your vitality attracts them. This is also a good thing because you’ll receive huge benefits when they reach the Nine-Colored Saint Lotuses with your vitality. Every time the saint lotuses make a breakthrough, the lake's quality will transform.”

Mu Xueling said while she taught Lin Yun the complete Nine Lotus Art.

An hour later, Lin Yun learned the Nine Lotus Saint Seal. When he dropped his blood essence into the painting, the painting was like a water ripple that slowly fused into his body. The painting traveled throughout his body before it stopped at the Golden Crow Divine Rune on his back.

“If you can obtain the blood of powerful saint beasts, the saint lotuses will benefit from them when you refine it.” Mu Xueling explained. “I’ll leave the Nine Lotus Diagram in your hands now.”

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that. Didn’t they come to an agreement that he would only loan it? He hesitated before he said, “Saint Elder… This doesn’t sound like a good idea.”

He felt uneasy about receiving too much, and Mu Xueling was too good to him.

“You can rest now. When you grasp the first sword of the Divine Firefly Sword, I’ll guide you in music dao and the Heavenly Mulberry Score.” Mu Xueling said.

“Okay. I will do my best at the Nirvana Banquet.” Lin Yun said seriously and bowed before leaving.

When Lin Yun was about to leave this secret realm, Mu Xueling suddenly said, “Lin Yun, the golden age will descend upon Kunlun again, and I hope your name will be on the Blue Dragon Record one day.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Lin Yun was briefly stunned when he heard that because he heard about the Blue Dragon Record again. The old man was right. Mu Xueling might have something to do with the Blue Dragon Record. But this made him even more baffled. The Blue Dragon Record was the supreme treasure of the Divine Dragon Empire. So how could Mu Xueling have something to do with it?

“I got it.” Lin Yun smiled and left the secret realm.

After leaving the Aquafrost Secret Realm, Lin Yun did not go to rest as Mu Xueling asked. He began to get familiar with the Sword Heart.

The Sword Heart was special, since it was located in his heart, between the boundaries of real and fake. It was practically unnoticeable when he didn’t use it, and no one would sense it, either.

He gave it several attempts, and it was roughly fifty meters in radius when he didn’t activate it. If he activated it, the range would multiply by three to five-fold, but his sword intent would also be rapidly exhausted.

“Saint Elder is right. I did come in touch with the surface of Sword Heart before.” Lin Yun recalled his state when he comprehended the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. He felt he had a pair of eyes growing at the back of his head, but it was previously a form of instinct, and he couldn’t control it as he wished.

Now that he could control it as he wanted, he could practice it and develop it into a sword domain. The sword domain was what Mu Xuankong previously used to kill the patriarch of the Nether Divinity Clan, sheathing his sword for three hundred years and drenching his sword in saint blood to become famous.

Lin Yun spent the remaining time practicing the Divine Firefly Sword.

Two days later, Lin Yun drew his sword in the courtyard. His sword ray was as dazzling as sunlight that lit up the entire yard. But Lin Yun’s movements were slow, a drastic contrast from when he rapidly drew his sword earlier.

As his sword slowed, an invisible air current flowed around in the space. The airflow was weak and couldn’t be seen with the naked eye. But under Lin Yun’s Sword Heart, he could clearly see the movement of the Divine Firefly Sword.

The dazzling sword ray that he emitted became dim. It was bizarre and incomprehensible. The massive sword's intent dissolved all the light, making it look even more unfathomable.

A brief moment later, the courtyard fell into darkness, but the sword intent Lin Yun released didn’t weaken. The sword intent within his brows became even more shocking, and he exhausted two-thirds of his sword intent in such a short time.

The sky became darker, and starlight couldn’t even shine down. When he nearly exhausted his sword intent, the surroundings became so dark that no one could sense it with just dragon origin. If someone tried to probe with their mental energy, they would be shocked to discover his mental energy fell into the abyss. Lin Yun was the only one left in this pitch-black world.

A hundred fifty meters around him was like an abyss, and no one could see anything, no matter how they tried. Suddenly, fireflies bloomed in the darkness, Lin Yun’s sword intent suddenly exploded, and the sword ray released was like a dazzling sun. The surrounding space trembled with cracks spreading out, as though space had collapsed.

“What power!” Lin Yun’s face became pale, but his pupils were filled with joy. He had finally entered the threshold of the Divine Firefly Sword with his sword intent manifesting into compressed formless water. When it was compressed to a limit, he still had to control it because all his effort would go down the drain if he made a mistake, and he would run amok.

He realized why he couldn’t comprehend this sword technique until now. This was because he wouldn’t be able to sense the invisible air current if he didn’t grasp Sword Heart.

“I have just entered the threshold, and I’ll need to practice it, or it’ll be useless in actual battle.” Lin Yun said after calming down. After all, his opponent wouldn’t give him the time to prepare when fighting his opponent. If his opponent took the opportunity to break his sword technique, he would suffer a backlash.

Lin Yun spent his remaining time practicing the Divine Firefly Sword and Heavenly Mulberry Score. Other than that, he would accompany Yue Weiwei to practice the Nine Heavenly Profound Dance when he was free. Everything was calm and straightforward.

As Nirvana Banquet slowly approached, the atmosphere within the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion became even more intense. Even Lin Yun could sense that the disciples were feeling uneasy with no confidence. When he occasionally met Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi, he noticed that they looked haggard.

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples had no confidence in the upcoming Nirvana Banquet. They were at the bottom multiple times and heard that this Nirvana Banquet would be on a much bigger scale than before. This was because it had been a long time since the Three-Lives Tree bore fruit, and the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion was losing their patience.

Aside from the Four Musical Houses, they had sent disciples from around the Eastern Desolation and even the Divine Dragon Empire. They would pay every sect with some reputation in music, trying to win over all musical geniuses. So there was no doubt that the scale of this Nirvana Banquet would be the largest.

This was why the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion was anxious, but Mu Xueling wasn’t bothered at all. Lin Yun was confused because he had no idea what she was thinking.

To be honest, the Nirvana Banquet didn’t mean much to Lin Yun. The rewards were somewhat attractive, at most. But he wouldn’t be too bothered if he couldn’t obtain it. His true objective was to find out if the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion was related to the Azure Dragon’s lineage.

But he received too much during his time in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. He didn’t want to see the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion ranked at the bottom again. So he was pretty serious when Mu Xueling taught him the Heavenly Mulberry Score.

When the Divine Firefly Sword reached lesser mastery, he temporarily placed his sword dao down and spent time practicing the Heavenly Mulberry Score. This song was complex to learn, way harder than any ancient scores that Lin Yun had learned by far. He had never seen such a complicated song before, but the power also left him breath taken.

Aside from that, he was also waiting for Gu Jun to return. Two months passed, and Lin Yun was furious when he saw Gu Jun returning from the Heavenly Star Pavilion. He didn’t even have to think about what Gu Jun did during his time there.

“Relax, you can’t blame me for this.” Gu Jun smiled. “The dragon tendons you’re looking for weren’t easy to find, and that lass had to help out. She was passionate and asked me to stay in the Heavenly Star Pavilion to wait for the news. I couldn’t refuse, even if I wanted to.”

Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with that for now, and he asked, “Where are the things I asked of you?”

“Hehe, here! They’re genuine ancient dragon tendons, and they’re even refined by a Heavenly Spiritualist. She had done a lot for you.” Gu Jun said, taking out a long box.

Ancient Dragon Tendons? Lin Yun was simultaneously surprised and touched by An Liuyan.
