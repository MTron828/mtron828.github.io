Wang Muyan was mysterious, and not even Xiao Jingyan could see through her, not even her actual appearance. This was because she cultivated the Thousand Faced Demonic Art, possessing the Natal Saint Heart and the unawakened Divine Lunar Yin Physique. But this was all revealed by the Wang Clan, and no one knew if it was genuine or fake.

“Have you discovered why he went to the Myriad Graves Valley?” Wang Muyan asked.

“It’s not clear. The Myriad Graves Valley is mysterious, but no one knows its secrets. The only valuable item is the Udumbara Flower,” Xiao Jingyan said.

“But it’s not easy to obtain the Udumbara Flower. It’s more worthwhile to go after the Divine Blood Flower rather than the Udumbara Flower.” Wang Muyan’s eyes lit up, and she smiled, “The Divine Blood Flower… it’s a treasure… let me think about it…”

Xiao Jingyan asked, “Holy Maiden, are you going to the God Burial Mountain Range?”

Wang Muyan’s gaze flickered, and she smiled, “I’m in the crucial moment of making a breakthrough, and I can’t leave this place so easily. But I will personally make a trip there if there’s an opportunity.”

“For the Divine Blood Flower or Ye Qingtian?” Xiao Jingyan asked.

“What if I want them both?” Wang Muyan smiled.

“Ye Qingtian is already a dead person, and I will personally make a move. So he’ll undoubtedly be dead. Holy Maiden can go for the Divine Blood Flower if you wish to go out. I’ll find a way to snatch the Divine Blood Flower for you from the hands of the six holy lands,” Xiao Jingyan said.

“I have my plans with the Divine Blood Flower. You go with them and try to find Ye Qingtian’s true objective. You can capture him alive, but don’t kill him,” Wang Muyan smiled.

Xiao Jingyan briefly hesitated before he nodded. Before leaving, he mustered his courage and asked, “Holy Maiden, when will you tell me the secrets regarding the Divine Solar Lunar Rune?”

“Relax. Even if I tell you about it, you won’t be able to retrieve it anytime soon. It’s not time yet,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“Okay.” Xiao Jingyan retreated.

Lin Yun had been riding Lil’ Red in its Dragon-Blooded Horse form for seven days before finally reaching the God Burial Woods. The God Burial Woods was located outside the God Burial Mountain Range, and it was a massive forest that was covered in a blood mist, permeating a mysterious and devilish aura.

The God Burial Woods was famous within Eastern Desolation, and not a single person within Eastern Desolation didn’t know about it. It was rumored that deities have died here during ancient times. When the Golden Era was destroyed, a huge battle occurred, and there were many ancient ruins within the God Burial Woods.

But Lin Yun’s objective wasn’t the God Burial Woods, but the God Burial Mountain Range instead. The God Burial Mountain Range had an ancient and powerful seal. The interior of the mountain range was a mysterious world, and the Myriad Graves Valley was situated within it.

Senior Sister Xin Yan was looking for the Divine Blood Flower within the God Burial Mountain Range. This was because the seal would gradually weaken as time passed, and spatial fragments would appear. But those spatial fragments only allowed those beneath the Quasi-Saint Realm to enter. If those above the Quasi-Saint Realm tried to enter, their only outcome would be death. But the case might be different in the future. Many people speculated that the seal would weaken so that even Quasi-Saints could enter.

Four hours later, Lin Yun found a place to rest within the God Burial Woods to cultivate. But after he closed his eyes, someone riding a white horse approached. This horse also possessed the dragon clan’s bloodline, and it was extraordinary. No ordinary demonic beasts would dare to approach this horse, but after this horse looked at Lil’ Red, it was afraid and didn’t dare to approach. No matter how the rider tried to control the horse, the horse just wouldn’t approach within a hundred miles of Lil’ Red.

With no choice, the rider could only come down from it. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he saw Bai Qingyu coming down from the white horse. She was donned in white clothes that made her look clean. Bai Qingyu proudly said, “Ye Qingtian, don’t think that I won’t recognize you just because you have a hat on!”

Lin Yun only disguised himself simply with the bamboo hat, and it wasn’t surprising that someone could see through his identity. But he was curious about how Bai Qingyu managed to find him so accurately. He asked, “How did you find me here?”

“That’s a secret.” Bai Qingyu glared at Ye Qingtian and said, “I already said that you can’t shake me off. Your head belongs to me.”

Lin Yun removed the bamboo hat and said, “Even if I give you a hundred tries, you can’t kill me.”

“Don’t be so sure now. Many people know that you’ve gone to the Myriad Graves Valley and you will definitely be in trouble when you fight others. I just have to stay on the side and watch,” Bai Qingyu smiled, raising her brow.

“Not bad, you know how to use your brain now,” Lin Yun said.

“That’s for sure!” Bai Qingyu said proudly, but she immediately sensed something unusual with Ye Qingtian’s tone.

While pondering, Lin Yun waved his hand at the Stalewater Sword on the white horse. The white horse wanted to escape, but Lil’ Red grinned and stood in its way.

The Stalewater Sword resisted Lin Yun, but Lin Yun had a powerful sword intent, and it didn’t take long for the Stalewater Sword to fly into his hand.

“My sword!” Bai Qingyu exclaimed. Under her disbelief, Ye Qingtian even drew the Stalewater Sword out. This naturally shocked Bai Qingyu, and she exclaimed, “H-How is this possible?!”

The Stalewater Sword was a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact with her imprint. So not a single person could draw it out without her permission. Bai Qingyu came to her senses and dashed over, “Return it to me!”

Lin Yun had no intentions of taking the Stalewater Sword away. He just had a speculation and got his answer after drawing it out. This Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact was unique, and even his ‘broken sword’ physique couldn’t break this sword in a short time. But he didn’t hold it for long and sheathed it before tossing it back to Bai Qingyu.

“How did you do it?” Bai Qingyu asked.

Lin Yun jumped on the Dragon-Blooded Horse and said, “There are many things in the world that you don’t know about. Stop following me. The God Burial Mountain Range is dangerous, and someone like you will lose your life. Let’s go!”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The Dragon-Blooded Horse ran and soon disappeared.

“How dare you look down on me when you’re already in trouble. Hmph, follow him!” Bai Qingyu’s face became red with her cheeks puffed as she jumped on the white horse, chasing after Ye Qingtian.

Three days later, Lin Yun came to a treehouse inn. This inn was built by emptying the interior of the tree. Many people were coming in and out of the God Burial Mountain Range, so someone naturally created an inn business here as a lodge for visitors. This was also a simple market for exchanging information.

One could enjoy their time here if they were willing to spend money. So there were all sorts of people here. If anyone wanted to enter the God Burial Mountain Range through the spatial crack, they would have to buy a Bloodflame Crystal from the inn owner and wait for the seal’s fluctuation to calm down.

Lin Yun entered the inn, bought a Bloodflame Crystal, and was brought to a hall. There were many cultivators gathered here, and they were all planning to enter the God Burial Mountain Range.

Lin Yun’s arrival did not cause any commotion, so he casually went up the stairs to wait. Lil’ Red also returned to its cat form and drank some wine beside him.

“The Divine Blood Flower is going to appear soon, and I heard that the King Ranking’s geniuses from the holy lands are all going there.”

“The Divine Blood Flower is the most valuable treasure within the God Burial Mountain Range, and the appearance of each Divine Blood Flower will cause an uproar. The majority of experts on the King Ranking will gather there.”

“It’s futile no matter how many people go. Demonic cultivators and wandering cultivators cannot be compared to the saint disciples of the holy lands, and they can only try their luck with some saint herbs that appear with the Divine Blood Flower.”

“But if the first on the King ranking, Jin Xuanyi, went there, the six holy lands will have no show.”

“Jin Xuanyi has been first on the King Ranking for many years, so he can attempt to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm at any time. If he’s here, the saint disciples of the six holy lands might be unable to do anything to him.”

There were many cultivators at the Nirvana Stage in the inn, and they naturally knew a lot of information about the experts on the King Ranking. When Jin Xuanyi’s name appeared, the discussions became even more heated.

“First on the King Ranking?” Lin Yun muttered. He wondered how far he could reach on the King Ranking with his current strength.

There were various discussions within the hall, and someone even mentioned Flower Burial, who was first on the Empyrean, Elysium Core, and Dragon Pulse Rankings. Many people speculated that Flower Burial must have reached the Nirvana Stage by now, and he might be able to compete with Jin Xuanyi.

Then again, there were naturally many people who disagreed with that. After all, it had been a long time since Flower Burial last appeared, and no one felt that Flower Burial could confront the top-tiered saint disciples of the six holy lands.

Jin Xuanyi was mysterious, and his experience could be described as legendary. So many people amongst the demonic cultivators worshipped him.

Suddenly, the hall became quiet as a woman appeared. This woman had an extraordinary temperament, and it was rare for someone with her temperament to show up here. She was naturally Bai Qingyu, looking around as if she was looking for someone. When she discovered Ye Qingtian, she rejoiced and came over.

“I already said that you can’t shake me off.” Bai Shuying sat down and asked in a surprised tone, “Since when do you have a cat? This cat is pretty adorable!”

“The God Burial Mountain Range is unsuitable for you, and you’ll die here if you keep following me,” Lin Yun said.

“Ye Qingtian, aren’t you looking down on me? I was only careless in our previous fight, and you would not be my opponent if we fought for real,” Bai Qingyu said coldly. Bai Qingyu was like Bai Shuying, born with an extraordinary appearance;however, Bai Qingyu was more tender in comparison.

But this tenderness only made her look even more bewitching. She would shine brightly if she participated in an exchange between holy lands, and the various clan’s descendants would surround her like a moon. But it was a pity that there were various types of people in this inn. Many people’s gazes became lustful when they looked at her.

Finally, a demonic cultivator at the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage finally couldn’t hold it, and he walked over, “Bringing a chick with you to the God Burial Mountain Range. I can tell that you’re a ruthless person at first glance. State your price for me to play with her.”
