Chapter 1589 - Joining Hands

“This is the power of Demonic Ranking’s rising stars?” Chen Ling was left dumbfounded by this scene. This was because he didn’t expect they would suddenly become so powerful after using their trump cards.

As the terrifying phenomena created by their attacks enveloped that region, the scene looked even more devastating than an apocalypse. Regardless of the Thunderflame Saint Whip, Lightning Dragon Tablet, or Qin Cang’s Blood Devourer Canon, they were all terrifying.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word, but wore a grave expression while looking at Jiang Tong, who had yet to use his trump card.

Seeing that everyone else had resorted to their trump cards, Jiang Tong no longer held back and took out a pair of metal gloves from his interspatial pouch and put them on. The gloves had sharp thorns that looked like fangs embedded in the gloves.

But the terrifying part of those gloves was the crack on the palms that looked like the jaws of a ferocious beast with blood constantly flowing out of them.

“Thorn Fangs!” Everyone else who saw them could feel their scalps tingling as their faces changed. Those familiar with Jiang Tong knew that the gloves were forged from a plant called Thorn Flower and the Demonic Scarlet Metal. While it was a saint artifact, the glove was also alive and could be considered an extremely unusual treasure.

“Demonic Rune Tiger, leave here with my junior brother.” Lin Yun said.

The Demonic Rune Tiger was briefly stunned before it nodded and looked at Chen Ling, who had yet to recover from his shock.

Chen Ling was hesitant but ultimately chose to leave, “Senior Brother, be careful.”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I’ll be fine.” Lin Yun smiled at Chen Ling, telling the latter not to worry. After Chen Ling left, his smile disappeared, and he had an imperfect idea. This idea might be bold, but he could resolve his problem if he succeeded.

“We can finally play!” Jiang Tong grinned as a small sun rose behind him before chasing after the Heavenly Profound Tortoise and the other Demonic Ranking’s rising stars.

Simultaneously, a piece of flute music resounded and the ice sealing the bone flute youth finally shattered under the soundwaves.

The Thunderflame Saint Whip was the first to land on the tortoise shell, lighting up the colossal shell in flames. Looking from afar, the tortoise shell looked like a massive ball of fire.

But the flames couldn’t harm the Heavenly Profound Tortoise since the surface of the tortoise shell was covered in a chill, preventing the fire from penetrating the shell. But the lightning within the flames managed to penetrate the tortoise shell, and this was the first time anyone heard the Heavenly Profound Tortoise releasing a painful cry.

“Blood Ghost Blade!” With a sinister smile, the black saint blade in Qin Can’s hand turned into a demonic blade that bit into the tortoise shell like the jaws of a ferocious beast.

This time, the attack left a fine crack on the tortoise shell. The crack was tiny, but it was still a crack, and this instantly made everyone excited.

“Charge!” Chang Yu’s hair fluttered in the wind as he let out a ferocious roar while wielding the Lightning Dragon Tablet. A terrifying dragon broke through the third layer of heaven, enveloped in frightening lightning as it charged down with a boundless true dragon’s aura.

When the Lightning Dragon appeared, everyone was shocked to discover that the pressure released by the Heavenly Profound Tortoise’s bloodline had decreased. They instantly knew that the remnant soul of a True Dragon was sealed within the tablet. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be possible to suppress the bloodline pressure coming from the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, and it was no wonder that Chang Yu was pursued by the Emerald Jade Manor back then.

Under the Lightning Dragon’s attack, the saint runes on the tortoise shell kept shattering, and the production of new saint runes couldn’t keep up with the speed of the shattering saint runes.

“Die!” Jiang Tong charged over, pouring his dragon origin into his fists and rained down a bombardment of punches. His every punch was accompanied by dazzling golden light that was comparable to the sun, and all of his punches were focused in a single spot.

All the attacks made the Heavenly Profound Tortoise release a groan within the tortoise shell, and the tortoise also became anxious. It was enveloped in fear but didn’t dare to come out of the tortoise shell.

Thus, it could only charge left and right, trying to break free from the siege. But how could the Demonic Ranking’s rising stars allow the Heavenly Profound Tortoise to break free? They bore the risk of taking an attack from the Heavenly Profound Tortoise head-on and blocking the tortoise’s escape path. As long as they held on, it would only be a matter of time before the Heavenly Profound Tortoise was captured.

The Heavenly Profound Tortoise was in a dangerous position and could only execute various means to break free. Aside from charging around, it also attacked with its python-like tail. But since everyone was already prepared, they weren’t injured by it.

Failing again, the Heavenly Profound Tortoise released a terrifying chill, and it didn’t take long for the snow that had fallen to cover the entire Cold Pond. The chill was frightening and contained a wisp of the Heavenly Profound Tortoise’s bloodline. But the tortoise’s control over it was crude.

The power significantly decreased when the chill was spread out, making the four Demonic Ranking’s rising stars breathe a sigh of relief. After blocking a wave of attacks from the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, the Dragon Reversal Valley’s Yan Jiao was the first to make a move and constructed a massive net with the Thunderflame Saint Whip.

The net enveloped the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, and it was like a tangle of vines holding the tortoise down. But Yan Jiao wasn’t having an easy time because of the immense power of the tortoise, and his forehead was soon covered in sweat.

“Lesser Heavenly Sun!” Jiang Tong quickly threw the sun that was behind him over and also threw his punch forth.

“Blood Ghost Star Devourer!”

“Lightning Dragon Lock!” When Qin Can unleashed his attack, Chang Yu quickly controlled the Lightning Dragon to wrap around the Heavenly Profound Tortoise like a rope.

The black demonic blade landed on the tortoise shell and penetrated it. The demonic blade then started to devour the Heavenly Profound Tortoise’s vitality, and this brought excitement to Qin Can’s face, with the crimson light in his eyes shining brightly.

Under the attacks of the Demonic Ranking’s rising stars, the bloodline pressure from the Heavenly Profound Tortoise significantly dropped. Simultaneously, the flute music penetrated the tortoise shell and made the Heavenly Profound Tortoise wail out in pain.

“This Heavenly Profound Tortoise is only a baby, and the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood is only sufficient for two people. I’ll be taking one of those quotas.” Jiang Tong grinned after they managed to subdue the Heavenly Profound Tortoise.

“I can give up on the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood, but I want the tortoise shell.” Yan Jiao said.

“Haha.” The three Demonic Ranking’s rising stars smiled. Everyone had witnessed how powerful the tortoise shell was, so who wouldn’t want to take it for themselves? None of them were willing to give up on it, and they could only smile because the current situation wasn’t clear.

“I want the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood.” Qin Can said.

“Haha. What about me, then?” Chang Yu smiled eerily. The three wanted the most valuable part of the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, and nothing was left for him.

“This Heavenly Profound Tortoise is the descendant of a divine beast, and every single part of its body is a treasure. Not only is the meat delicious, it can also nourish the body. With it, you can stew a pot of delicacy.” Yan Jiao smiled.

“You’re courting death!” Chang Yu flew into a rage as he glared at Yan Jiao.

As the atmosphere between them tensed up, Jiang Tong and Qin Can exchanged a glance with a smile and chose to ignore it. The two had chosen the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood and formed a rapport.

“Let me join in the fun. If Brother Chang isn’t happy with the tortoise’s meat, I will take it on your behalf.” A voice suddenly resounded. When everyone turned their heads around, they saw an azure-robed youth walking over with a sword box on his back.

Lin Yun was wearing a smile as he walked over under the snow. He was only in the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, but he had no fear when facing the Demonic Ranking’s rising stars.

The Demonic Ranking’s rising stars were only briefly stunned and had no changes on their faces. After all, they already sensed an aura hidden in the surroundings, but that aura was weak, and they didn’t expect this person to dare to stand out.

“You’re pretty courageous for not returning to the Sword Sect!” Jiang Tong’s killing intent surged when he saw Lin Yun.

“Ha. How can I leave without taking your head? You killed my Sword Sect’s disciples, so you naturally have to pay with your life!” Lin Yun smiled and suddenly disappeared.

Pushing the Divine Sunchasing Art to the limit, Lin Yun reappeared on the back of the Heavenly Profound Tortoise that was being restricted in mid-air. This made the Demonic Ranking’s rising stars surprised because they were shocked by Lin Yun’s speed.

As Lin Yun squatted down, he placed his palm on the tortoise shell and raised his head with a smile. When he landed on the tortoise shell, he was instantly locked on by four killing auras and under immense pressure. Even the circulation of his dragon origin became sluggish.

“You must be the Sword Sect’s disciple who previously fought with Jiang Tong, right?” Chang Yu suddenly smiled with his eyes flickering.

“Who else can it be?” Lin Yun didn’t deny that. The commotion caused by their previous fight was huge, and it was natural that these people could sense it.

The three other rising stars were surprised to see Lin Yun admit it so quickly, and it was hard for them to imagine that Lin Yun was only at the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm to fight Jiang Tong.

“I have a personal feud with this person. Does anyone have any opinion about that?” Jiang Tong clenched his fist with the Thorn Fangs on and unleashed his killing aura.

“Ha. Come on, then. If I kill you, doesn’t that mean there will be one less person fighting for the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood?” Lin Yun said in a provocative tone. His words made everyone’s faces change. Especially Chang Yu, who peeked at Jiang Tong while tightening his grip on the Lightning Dragon Tablet.

“You’re smart, but it’s a pity that you don’t know the rules between demonic cultivators. We can fight amongst ourselves, but definitely not because of a Sword Sect’s disciple like you. Brother Chang, the treasures in his interspatial bracelet should be able to compensate for your loss, right?” Jiang Tong smiled eerily.

“I bet you have a high position in the Sword Sect to be so strong at such a young age, right?” Chang Yu grinned with greed flashing across his pupils.

“I’ve seen foolish people before, but I’ve never seen anyone as foolish as you. Did you really think the Demonic Ranking’s rising stars like us are fools?” Yan Jiao said with mockery flashing across his pupils.

“Go on and kill him. A mere ant like him thinks that he’s someone great?” Qin Can’s gaze was cold. Ever since he left the Heavenly Blade Pavilion, his hatred for the sect’s disciples reached a new height.

These four people who were arguing a moment ago suddenly became united as they snickered while looking at Lin Yun.

As Jiang Tong looked at Lin Yun with a pitiful gaze, he laughed, “I admire your courage. But it’s a pity you’re too foolish to come to me alone. You’ve saved me the effort of looking for you!”

The four of them had dragons appearing behind them while locking onto Lin Yun. They could take Lin Yun’s life in a split second. The four were on the Demonic Ranking, and no one could escape from them when they joined hands, especially someone who was only at the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

“You people think you’re brilliant. Why don’t you guys think about why I spent so much time talking to you?” Lin Yun looked at the four with a playful smile.

“Shit! He’s saving the Heavenly Profound Tortoise!” Yan Jiao was the first to sense something wasn’t right because some changes to the Heavenly Profound Tortoise were suppressed.

“What’s going on?” The three others also had their faces changed with disbelief. This was because, in such a short moment, a powerful vitality swept out from the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, and it suddenly became taxing for them to suppress the tortoise.

“Get rid of him!” The four no longer held back and unleashed their attacks towards Lin Yun. As for Jiang Tong, he personally charged over towards Lin Yun.

“Too late.” Lin Yun said coldly as he slowly stood up from the tortoise shell with a blue light flickering within his palm. That was from the power of the Blue Dragon Divine Rune.

A terrifying aura swept out from the Heavenly Profound Tortoise when he stood up.
