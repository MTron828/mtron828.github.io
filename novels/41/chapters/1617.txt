Chapter 1618 - Bizarre Valley

Even if everyone in the world felt that the Radiant Sword Saint would die, the sword in his hand would prove who made the decisions in the Ancient Barren Domain. If anyone dared to humiliate his master, he would grant death to them, and this was his sword path.

After killing Xuan Feng and Chen Tao, Lin Yun felt relaxed and serene. His sword dao became even more apparent, and his will became tougher. His sword dao had never been so clear before. After leaving that region, Lin Yun came to a mountain and sat down, “Is this my sword dao?”

His sword dao wasn’t meant to kill but to protect. It was meant to protect those who were significant to him, protecting the righteousness and fairness in his heart. Take this incident, for example. He defended the Sword Sect and his master’s prestige, which was his sword dao.

After figuring that out, Lin Yun’s thoughts became apparent, and a faint smile rose. He then turned to the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and sighed, “This umbrella is really powerful!”

The Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella had restrictions on it. It was a Glory Saint Artifact of the Dragon Clan, and there was a possibility that the Mo Clan produced it. After all, it had two glory spirits, the Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits. But there were a lot of glory spirits. Take the Glorysun Spirit, for example. There were at least a thousand engraved on the umbrella.

He only used half of the Glorysun Spirits previously, or barely even half. But as he gradually unlocks the restrictions, the glory spirits in it would continue to increase. Then again, this was only Lin Yun’s speculation, and he still wasn’t too sure about it.

There were three restrictions. If he wanted to undo the first restriction, he may even have to activate the Glorymoon Spirits. If there were only Glorysun Spirits and no Glorymoon Spirits, he might not be able to see the actual appearance of this umbrella.

“This is pretty good. My Flower Burial Sword is engraved with Glorygold Spirits, and I have to use my sword intent and dragon origin to activate it. On the other hand, the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella has Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits, and I only needed dragon runes to use it. Dragon runes are vitality, which means I could use two Glory Saint Spirits myself.” Lin Yun muttered with his eyes flickering.

The two might be different, but he couldn’t be sure which one was stronger. This was because he had never fully activated the glory spirits on the Flower Burial Sword. After all, he would exhaust all his dragon origin before pushing it to the limit.

“Let’s not care about that for now and reach the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.” Lin Yun said, recollecting his thoughts. Everyone was making swift progress in their cultivation after coming to the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and he now knew why this place was so important. If the Profound Sky Sect could return with a considerable harvest every time, it wasn’t surprising that they would become so powerful.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with determination. He couldn’t be bothered about that so much. His improvement in the Ancient Barren Battlefield wasn’t significant, and he had been relying on his current strength so far. This brought him a great sense of danger because who knew if there were any monsters in the Ancient Barren Battlefield? The top three on the Profound Sky Sect’s inner ranking put him under tremendous pressure.

“With the Golden Lotus foundation along with the saint elixirs in Chen Tao and Xuan Feng’s interspatial bracelets, it shouldn’t be an issue for me to reach the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. But the tribulation…” Lin Yun furrowed his brows. The Black Turtle Ancestor once told him that his tribulation would be much more terrifying than others because of his frightening foundation.

The Dragon Pulse Realm’s tribulations were troublesome to begin with. But Lin Yun’s tribulation would be even more terrifying.

“If it really doesn’t work, I can use the Profound Wither Key.” Lin Yun made up his mind. He could still use the Profound Wither Key six times, and it shouldn’t be an issue for the Profound Wither Great Saint’s saint origin to help him withstand the third tribulation.

But he appeared to be increasingly bound to his identity as the Southern Emperor’s successor. He recalled what the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord told him back then. The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said he was the Southern Emperor’s successor, but he neither denied nor admitted to it back then. But he now cultivated the Southern Emperor’s sword technique, and the Profound Wither Key came from his disciple. So it would be hard for him, even if he didn’t want to admit that he was the Southern Emperor’s successor.

While Lin Yun was making preparations to make a breakthrough in the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, the Sword Sect’s disciples entered a valley covered in snowflakes under Mu Xueqin and the saint disciples’ lead.

The Sword Sect’s disciples were lucky because they gathered a month after stepping into the Ancient Barren Battlefield and searched the valley. This valley had saint elixirs, and they could faintly see ancient ruins. If they were lucky, they might be able to find an extraordinary inheritance ground.

At the front of the group, Mu Xueqin, Ye Ziling, and Zhao Yan opened the path while the other saint disciples were responsible for reinforcements. But Gu Ruochen and Ye Qingxuan were nowhere to be seen. They had a critical mission to search for the legendary Blue Dragon Saint Palace.

To a sect, saint palaces were extremely tempting and important. Since Gu Ruochen and Ye Qingxuan weren’t around, the strongest in this party were Mu Xueqin and Ye Ziling. But even Mu Xueqin couldn’t see through Ye Ziling completely, which made the Divine Dragon Sword Physique and Radiant Snow Bloodline unfathomable.

Especially the Divine Dragon Sword Physique. After reaching the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, the feeling that Ye Ziling gave her was even more terrifying. She still had the White Dragon Saint Sword that Lin Yun obtained at the Heavenly Pool Gathering. This was a terrifying Glory Saint Artifact, and her true strength far exceeded everyone’s imagination.

It was so much so that in Mu Xueqin’s senses, Ye Ziling’s talent wasn’t inferior to Lin Yun’s, and her future achievements wouldn’t be any lower than his. Lin Yun was too dazzling, making everyone neglect Ye Ziling’s existence. But this wasn’t exactly bad.

As for Zhao Yan, Mu Xueqin glanced at him with a bitter smile. She even wondered if he was watching the path or aimlessly walking, relying on his senses.

An hour later, everyone’s scope suddenly expanded, and a gorgeous flower garden appeared before them. This was bizarre because this valley was so terrifyingly cold that they had difficulty withstanding it, even if they were at the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Everyone wouldn’t be surprised if snow-attributed saint elixirs were grown here. But the garden was blooming with various flowers, and those flowers shouldn’t be growing in this snow valley. When snowflakes landed on the flowers, they melted.

“How bizarre!”

“What’s with this valley?”

“Can it be that we really ran into an opportunity? Can it be that an expert died here and used his saint origin to nourish these flowers?”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“There’s a high possibility of that. Otherwise, these flowers would’ve died a long time ago.” The Sword Sect’s disciples looked at this valley with excitement. However, none of them moved, but looked at the three standing in front of the party, including Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan.

The Sword Sect’s disciples were united, and Mu Xueqin had a high prestige. No one would dare to move without her command, even if this place was filled with saint elixirs.

“Junior Sister Ye, what do you think?” Mu Xueqin turned to look at Ye Ziling. The latter grasped ice and thunder intent, so she would understand the situation here better than her.

“The snow here is a little weird.” Ye Ziling reached out and caught a snowflake. The snowflake slowly melted when it fell on her palm, and it emitted a faint light that lasted for a split second.

“Hm?” Mu Xueqin was surprised. Could it be that an ancient expert really died here?

“The snowflakes from before aren’t so weird. Perhaps there might be more to this valley.” Mu Xueqin said.

“We’ll know after we take a look.” Ye Ziling said.

Nodding her head, Mu Xueqin turned around, “Junior Brother Zhao, I will go in with Junior Sister Ye to take a look. You look after the other disciples.”

“Okay.” Zhao Yan replied softly.

“Junior Brother Zhao?” Mu Xueqin called out to him once more.

Zhao Yan came to his senses and exclaimed, “Senior Sister, you called me?”

Mu Xueqin smiled bitterly and wasn’t surprised by this. She replied, “Look at me when you speak.”

She couldn't do anything about it because she wasn’t sure if Zhao Yan was listening if he wasn’t looking at her. Among the saint disciples, Zhao Yan was the second strongest, aside from Ye Ziling.

“This place is a little weird. I’ll go with Junior Sister Ye to take a look. You stay here to look after the other disciples. Don’t daze off.” Mu Xueqin said.

“What thing is weird?” Zhao Yan was briefly stunned before he came to his senses and wore an embarrassed expression. He quickly corrected his words, “Senior Sister, don’t worry about it. I’ll take good care of the others.”

He had been comprehending the four swords of the Carefree 9 Swords that Lin Yun gave him, which was why he had dazed off.

“You fool.” Mu Xueqin smiled. “Let’s go.”

Mu Xueqin and Ye Ziling then walked into the valley, and the entire journey was smooth. Mu Xueqin said, “I wonder how Junior Brother Lin is doing now.”

“He won’t die. That fellow has a lot of trump cards, so he probably lost his way.” Ye Ziling replied calmly.

“Lost his way?” Mu Xueqin was briefly stunned before she smiled, “I never expected that Junior Sister Ye could be so humorous.”

“I’m not being humorous… This isn’t his first time losing his way.” Ye Ziling said.

An hour later, a towering tree appeared before them, an extremely ancient tree. The crown was covered in a mist, and if they looked at it carefully, they could see lightning within the mist. The surface of the tree had complicated patterns, and the tree was emitting a dangerous aura.

There was an old man seated under the tree, still emitting a terrifying saint aura, even after having died long ago.

Seeing this, Mu Xueqin exclaimed, “Someone died here!”

Furrowing her brows, Ye Ziling fell into deep thought, “I’m afraid this isn’t simple. Senior Sister, look!”

Ye Ziling pointed ahead of the old man. Ten-odd corpses were lying before that old man. They were all corpses of ancient demonspirits. Even after those demonspirits died, they still emitted a faint demonic aura from their corpses, and a silver line on their foreheads made them look noble. The ten of them were all Silver-Eyed Demonspirits.
