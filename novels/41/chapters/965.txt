Chapter 966 - Courting Death!

The spectators were dumbfounded by what just occurred. Lin Yun was a little too terrifying. Just a moment ago, he was being suppressed by four different people. However, in the blink of an eye, he used one punch to kill them.

“So this is the true power of a monarch fortune martial technique,” muttered Lin Yun. The power was akin to absolute suppression. Fortunately, he didn’t run into someone who knew a monarch fortune martial technique.

Otherwise, he would be killed in the blink of an eye despite his strong sword intent. In fact, they could probably destroy his sword intent with a single exchange.

Raising his head, Lin Yun watched as the four higher realms escaped. He couldn’t be bothered with the lackeys now that the leaders were dead. After all, how could an elite of a higher realm pose any threat to him?

A black figure flashed through the sky and gathered the interspatial pouches of Liu Mu, Mo Yan, Xu Que, and Mu Ziyi. It was naturally Lil’ Red who Lin Yun had instructed not to interfere. But the moment the battle ended, Lil’ Red pounced onto the pouches. Furthermore, Lil’ Red didn’t seem to have any intention of handing the pouches to Lin Yun.

“Hehe.” Lil’ Red chuckled before returning to Lin Yun’s shoulder. The surroundings were silent as everyone looked at Lin Yun. No one could conceal the fear and respect in their eyes. How could they treat him like an underdog anymore?

Aside from the seven heads on the Azure Dragon Ranking, they couldn’t think of anyone who could suppress Lin Yun. To make matters more impressive, Lin Yun was from a lower realm!

“Let’s go. We’ve wasted enough time here.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed because his goal was the seven constellation palaces and the legendary Azure Dragon Palace. He had no interest in the 126 astral palaces because his strength had outgrown them. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It wasn’t too long ago that Chen Xun looked down on Lin Yun. After all, only those who competed for the five astral spirits were considered strong. But now that Lin Yun had reached that level, he was able to target the inheritances of the seven constellation palaces. Maybe he could even target the Azure Dragon Palace in the future.

He was certain that he would find some greater dao artifacts, saint pellets, spiritual rune inheritances, and complete advanced fortune martial techniques. And after experiencing the power of the Divine Glorysun Fist, Lin Yun was extremely interested in advanced fortune martial techniques.

The power of his Three Heavenly Divides was comparable to the Divine Glorysun Fist. However, those were the only three swords that he could use to instantly kill someone. If they were rendered useless, he would be in deep trouble.

So Lin Yun still needed a sword technique. He needed one that wasn’t part of a sword sutra, like the Dustlight Sword Art. Although he could empower his Divine Glorysun Fist with his sky sword intent, it wasn’t appropriate. So he needed a sword technique that he could use his sky sword intent with.

Lin Yun pushed these thoughts to the back of his mind and continued his journey. He was already two days late after his setback. So he had to try his best to move fast. As he proceeded deeper into the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, he passed by stronger geniuses.

There were a lot more elites from the Azure Dragon Region than he imagined. Since news of the inheritances in the astral palaces was common knowledge, he had many people to compete with.

Two days passed in the blink of an eye. Lin Yun’s travels took him to astral palaces where the competition was stiff. He confirmed that the astral palaces didn’t contain anything of worth. They were filled with incomplete inheritances, which were a waste of his time.

Lin Yun had no interest in those inheritances. He cared more about the constellation palace that represented the Glorysun Spirit. Even when he passed astral palaces with complete inheritances, he didn’t waste his time.

One particular day, Lin Yun saw the ruins of a majestic sect on the horizon. The ruins were enveloped in layers of starlight. Strangely, these ruins were filled with many intact structures and buildings. It even had a palace in the center that was so high that it pierced the starry sky.

Many people were gathered at the palace, but no one dared to move. There were several higher realms sealing off the entrance as they waited for the barrier to weaken.

“Is that an astral palace with a complete inheritance?” Lin Yun stopped and looked around to figure out what was going on. Astral palaces with complete inheritance were nothing to Lin Yun, but they were extremely valuable in the eyes of some higher realms, not to mention the lower realms.

If it wasn’t found by the higher realms, it might be split between the intermediate and lower realms. But the moment they were found by the higher realms, the higher realms would join hands to seal off the entrance.

In the end, everyone had to helplessly watch the higher realms ransack the place for treasures. It was a scene that Lin Yun was all too familiar with. However, he wouldn’t interfere since he was low on time.

“Wow, seven higher realms are joining hands. It looks like the inheritance in this astral palace isn’t simple.” Lin Yun could tell that there were vague ancient words that could be seen on the palace at the center, Cloud Soul Sect. The name put strong pressure on Lin Yun as he examined the palace.

“This should be one of the strongest astral palace inheritances. No wonder there are seven higher realms here.” In Lin Yun’s analysis, there was no way that a complete inheritance could compare to the inheritances in the constellation palaces. So he didn’t want to waste his time unnecessarily.

But his face changed when he saw three people bound in front of the mountain. He quickly rushed over because the three were being used as an example by the higher realms. They were meant to serve as a warning, so they were in a pathetic state. However, Lin Yun could easily tell that they were his companions from the Profound Amber Realm.

The leader of the seven higher realms was a black-clothed youth. “This place is already owned by us. These three will be an example of what happens when you dare to barge in.”

As he spoke, he revealed his aura in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, which crushed Zhu QIngshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu. Their faces were filled with pain as their bones started to crack.

In just a brief moment, their skin tore as blood dripped everywhere. Clearly, the black-clothed youth was trying to intimidate the crowd. Everyone could tell that he was skilled in torture.

“You guys are pretty tough. Kneel!” The youth smiled as he flicked his finger. He unleashed strands of crimson energy into their bodies.

“Urghhh!” Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu couldn’t hold back anymore as they vomited blood.

“Damn it! This Azure Rainbow Realm’s leader is too much.”

“I heard that they found this astral palace first and then the Azure Rainbow Realm’s men came before it opened.”

“Although it’s not rare to see brutal people among the higher realms, it’s rare to see someone that tortures others like guy does.”

“Haha. That’s because you knew nothing about Shi Ming. Everyone who died in his hands was tortured to death. None of them were given an easy death.”

“Are cultivators from the lower realms playthings to the higher realms?” Everyone on the mountain had fear in their eyes. Even the higher realms couldn’t stand to watch Shi Ming, but they didn’t utter a word.

A moment ago, many people were willing to take a risk to get the inheritance, but they didn’t dare to make a move anymore.

“Still not kneeling?” Seeing that Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu weren’t kneeling, a cold light flashed across Shi Ming’s eyes.

“Dream on, you bastard!” Zhu Qingshan cursed back in return.

“What stubbornness! I had enough fun now. If you won’t kneel, you can die!” Shi Ming’s expression was indifferent and his gaze was cold. Slowly raising his right hand, he poured his origin energy into his hand.

In that split second, the aura radiating from his palm was terrifying. Everyone could tell that Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu were going to lose their lives. This caused the crowd to stay quiet.

Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu did nothing wrong. But because they arrived first, they were being used as an example by the Azure Rainbow Realm. Many intermediate and lower realm geniuses were full of sympathy, but they didn’t dare to do anything.

After all, there were seven higher realms present. If they tried to do something, they would die.

“You better think carefully before making a move. Otherwise, I’ll make you wish you were dead!” Just when everyone was feeling powerless, a rumbling voice echoed out full of iciness.
