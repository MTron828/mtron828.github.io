Chapter 195 - Snow

Every year after the newcomer test, the Sword Firmament Pavilion would hold a grand event called the Nine Star Contest. As the name implied, it was a competition for newcomers with nine stars. Those who couldn’t obtain nine stars were qualified to compete. They could only be spectators, watching those with nine stars shine brightly on the stage.

This was a personal honor and had implications for potential resources that one could enjoy. An outstanding performance could even attract the attention of seniors in the pavilion.

If a Sword-Bearing Elder chose them as their disciple, they would soar into the sky. All of this would take place on the enormous stage at the foot of the Sword Firmament Pavilion. More than two hundred newcomers excitedly looked at the stage, full of expectation.

The remaining newcomers were disappointed. A blue barrier enveloped the stage and only those with nine stars in their pendants could get on the stage.

The Nine Star Contest would begin with hundreds of puppets appearing on the stage. Each puppet possessed strength at the Profound Martial Realm level. The newcomers would be rewarded with a spiritual jade for each puppet that they defeated. At the end of the competition, the newcomers would be ranked according to their spiritual jades.

Aside from not being able to use cosmic artifacts, the competition had no rules. This meant that you could snatch the spiritual jades that others took.

Bai Ting was presiding over the competition. He waved his hand and the incense outside the stage lit up. When the incense lit up, the statue-like puppets started to descend from the sky.

“Get on the stage!” The newcomers stood on the stage in excitement. In an instant, someone had already suppressed a puppet. After all, the puppets had no intelligence. Meaning, those with similar cultivations to the puppets would have a huge advantage.

This meant that Profound Martial Realms would shine brightly in the competition. The stronger newcomers immediately caught everyone’s attention. On the stage, Wang Ning swung his sword, producing lightning with every swing. He truly shined bright amid the two hundred newcomers.

He was the descendant of the Wang Clan that had a deep foundation. Although he made his breakthrough with the Profound Breaking Pellet, he was still stronger than other newcomers. It didn’t take long for him to defeat a puppet. After defeating the puppet, he reached out for the dazzling spiritual jade.

“Get lost!” Wang Ning laughed and kicked two newcomers out of his way.

Upon seeing this scene, Bai Ting smiled, “Not bad. Wang Ning has deep attainment in his sword technique. The Wang Clan is truly worthy of being one of the four major clans. If he continues like this, he will definitely be among the top ten.”

Wang Yan couldn’t hide his joy and smiled, “This little bastard didn’t let me down. Look, Leng Mo isn’t bad either! He has already defeated three puppets.”

Nodding his head, Bai Ting praised, “You have a good eye for people. I’ll be proud if they can reach the top ten.”

Wang Yan smiled confidently. He sneered at Xin Yan, whose face looked unsightly. Like Xin Yan, Elder Luo Feng’s face was also ugly. He did not have a good relationship with Bai Ting in the Sword Firmament Pavilion and they could be considered rivals. In this year’s contest, Luo Feng had lost thoroughly, while Bai Ting had performed well.

The expression on Xin Yan’s face was ugly. A trace of unconcealable hatred and murderous intent appeared in her eyes. If Lin Yun were around, Wang Ning wouldn’t have the chance to act arrogant. After all, Lin Yun grasped the incomplete sword intent, so he would shine in the Nine Star Contest.

Although he might not be comparable to Huangfu Jingxuan, his performance would definitely be better than Wang Ning. Right at this moment, a white figure charged towards the stage.

“What is that fellow trying to do?”

“Doesn’t he know that only those with nine stars can enter the stage?”

The Nine Stars Contest had already started and all eligible contestants were already on the stage. So everyone felt that this person was just messing around and none of them panicked. The barrier enveloping the stage would reject everyone else aside from those with nine stars in their pendants.

There were two prerequisites to enter the stage. The first was that one had to be a newcomer of the Sword Firmament Pavilion. The second was that they had to have nine stars in their jade pendant. Many people began to smile, waiting for this person to embarrass himself. In the past, some newcomers had similarly tried their luck.

But against everyone’s expectation, that person entered the stage without any obstruction. When everyone took a clearer look at this person, they were shocked. It was someone in white wearing a faceless mask. All the attention that was on Wang Ning immediately shifted to the masked man.

The moment the white figure landed on the ground, he unsheathed his sword. The puppet that Wang Ning was fighting suddenly suffered a stab from the white figure and exploded. The white figure reached his hand out and snatched the spiritual jade before Wang Ning could.

The white figure had only revealed his eyes through the mask, but everyone could sense his unique temperament. All of a sudden, the stage became silent. Huangfu Jingxuan, Han Mo, Han Feng, Feng Haoyu, Mo Qingyun, and the other Profound Martial Realms looked at the white figure in astonishment.

Everyone knew that Wang Ning was Wang Yan’s brother. So even if they were stronger than Wang Ning, no one dared to rob the latter. Only Wang Ning had the boldness to rob others, not the other way round.

Looking at the white figure, Mo Qingyun sneered, “Where did this guy come from? He actually snatched Wang Ning’s puppet, is he blind?”

The other Profound Martial Realms were surprised and shared the same thoughts. Outside the stage, Bai Ting looked at Wang Yan and asked, “Who is this person?”

Knitting his brows together, Wang Yan shook his head, “I’m not sure, but he must be a newcomer since he can step onto the stage.”

Bai Ting personally distributed the jade pendants and each one had a specific owner. So there was no way someone could take the jade pendant of a dead newcomer and come here.

On the other side, Elder Luo Feng, who was equally puzzled, looked at Xin Yan. When Xin Yan saw this scene, a hint of joy flashed on her face. She replied, “It doesn’t matter who this person is. It’s good that someone is teaching Wang Ning a lesson.”

Wang Ning’s face turned blue with anger. He was in a good mood from earlier when he saw Xin Yan gnash his teeth. He had been waiting for the Nine Stars Contest to show off. However, someone just snatched his spiritual jade. This was equivalent to a slap on his face.

The white-clothed swordsman played with the jade and then put it away.

“It doesn’t matter who you are. Hand it over or else…” But before Wang Ning could finish his words, he was slapped on his face. The slap was crisp and was heard by everyone. Wang Ning was left stunned before he unleashed his aura.

But the white-clothed swordsman had also unleashed an aura in the Profound Martial Realm. Furthermore, this person’s aura was stronger than him. Wang Ning’s aura instantly collapsed when they clashed.

The white-clothed swordsman slapped Wang Ning again and sent him flying. The two slaps left Wang Ning and the crowd dumbfounded. Even the likes of Huangfu Jingxuan couldn’t believe it.

“Second young master!” Leng Mo immediately charged over. “Die!”

When he arrived in front of the white-clothed swordsman, he had accumulated his aura to an unbelievable level. Combined with his cultivation, he was almost twice as strong as Wang Ning. At this moment, everyone finally realized that Leng Mo had been hiding his strength.

However, the white-clothed swordsman did not panic. He casually raised the sword in his hand and blocked Leng Mo’s attack, which left Leng Mo briefly stunned.

But before he could react, the white-clothed swordsman thrust his sword. It moved at an incredible speed that forced Leng Mo to defend. But as they clashed, the white-clothed swordsman’s attacks grew faster and faster.

In just eight moves, Leng Mo’s aura crumbled. Leng Mo was shocked and despair filled his heart. But the white-clothed swordsman suddenly stopped and swung his sword, plunging it into the ground.

Leng Mo was surprised when he saw this. He immediately felt relieved and retreated. But a long black spear suddenly appeared in the white-clothed swordsman’s hand, destroying Leng Mo’s sword aura. Before Leng Mo could even yell, the spear tip plunged into his chest and sent him flying away while spewing blood.

Leng Mo held onto his wound and struggled to get on his feet. No one could see the white-clothed swordsman’s expression under the faceless mask. He simply held onto the spear tightly and started pouring his origin energy into it. Just as Leng Mo was finally getting on his feet, the spear plunged through Leng Mo’s chest and pinned him to the ground.

“ARGGGH!” Leng Mo cried out, but the white-clothed swordsman retrieved his sword and walked towards Wang Ning. A cold aura exploded out from the white-clothed swordsman. The onlookers felt a chill run down their spine. Even Huangfu Jingxuan and the others changed their expressions.

Outside the stage, the newcomers and senior disciples were thrown into a clamor. Wang Yan’s body trembled and his lips turned purple from anger. Looking at the white-clothed swordsman walking over to Wang Ning with his sword, Wang Yan’s face changed, “He’s going to kill my younger brother!”

Wang Yan wanted to make his move, but he suddenly recalled that no one could get through the barrier before the Nine Stars Contest ended.

Back on the stage, Wang Ning had collapsed on the ground in fear. Both sides of his face were now swollen. Looking at the white-clothed swordsman approaching, Wang Ning began to tremble, “You want my spiritual jades? I can give them all to you. Just please don’t kill me… I’m the direct descendant of the Wang Clan and Wang Yan is my brother. I can fulfill any of your demands.”

However, the white-clothed swordsman continued walking and didn’t respond. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Wang Ning nearly went insane from the fear that had accumulated in his heart. He shouted, “WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!”

“Who do you think I am?” The white-clothed swordsman responded with a question instead.

Wang Ning heard a buzz go off in his head when he heard the white-clothed swordsman’s question. Disbelief filled his face. The voice was too familiar to him and if it was that person… Wang Ning’s face immediately turned pale, “T-t-that’s not possible!”

A cold light flickered across the white-clothed swordsman’s eyes. He raised his hand to his mask and removed it, revealing his handsome face. He was someone that shouldn’t be here, but at this moment, he was standing before everyone.

“Lin Yun!”
