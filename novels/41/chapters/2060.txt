Chapter 2061 - Make You Move!

The lake was severed into two with waterfalls on both sides creating a deafening sound, which lasted for a long time. When everyone’s gazes fell on Ye Qingtian, they were numb as they looked at this genius from the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Everyone from the Sword Alliance felt helpless and conflicted. How great would it have been if Ye Qingtian came from the Sword Alliance? If that was the case, they would be cheering by now.

Lin Yun sheathed his sword and landed on a statue. He placed the Flower Burial Sword beside him and closed his eyes to treat his injuries.

“Holy shit, he still wants to fight!”

“Does he want to embarrass the Sword Alliance? Just how ruthless is he?!”

“He has already stolen the limelight, and his name will spread throughout the Kunlun Realm after this. So why can’t he stop here?”

“Is there really no one from the Sword Alliance capable of stopping him?” Everyone was dumbfounded when they watched Ye Qingtian treat his injuries. The commotion in the surroundings could no longer be suppressed and everyone was clenching their fists while gritting their teeth. But none of them dared to go up and challenge Ye Qingtian.

At the palace, Feng Shaoyu’s face was pale because what he was the most worried about had happened. Not only was Zhao Wuji defeated, but he was defeated in such an embarrassing manner. No one could tell where Ye Qingtian was because the sword aura behind that sword was too powerful.

“Jiang Yunting!” Feng Shaoyu turned to look at the genius from the Myriad Sword Pavilion with hope in his eyes.

But Jiang Yunting was placed in a difficult position as he shook his head.

“Brother Jiang is afraid?” Feng Shaoyu asked.

Jiang Yunting sighed, “Young Manor Master, you don’t have to try and provoke me. I’ll be honest with you, I’m afraid.”

Hearing what Jiang Yunting said, Feng Shaoyu roared, “Where’s your backbone as a swordsman?!”

Not only was Jiang Yunting not furious, he laughed, “So what? Having a backbone like your Hidden Sword Manor? By being so cocky, wanting a face-off between Astral Sword Intents and geniuses, but couldn’t even take a single sword?”

“You!” Feng Shaoyu was so furious that he couldn’t speak, and his face was terrifyingly dark. Feng Shengling was trembling beside him, not daring to say a word because he had embarrassed the Hidden Sword Manor.

But fortunately, Jiang Yunting had a relatively warm temperament and said, “Brother Feng, relax. I’m only making an analogy. As swordsmen, we’re naturally not afraid of death or a fight. But going up to fight even when knowing you have no chance is pure stupidity, and asking to be embarrassed. I might be a swordsman, but I’m not brainless.”

Feng Shaoyu’s expression softened, before he briefly pondered, then asked, “You have no odds? He exposed quite a bit of his trump cards through this fight. If you’re willing to make a move, the Hidden Sword Manor can give you ten Great Solar Saint Pellets, regardless of the outcome.”

Jiang Yunting’s eyes lit up when he heard that, but his eyes soon diminished as he helplessly said, “Young Manor Master, you’re generous. But if I was confident in the fight, I would make a move even without your offer. After all, I’m also a member of the Sword Alliance, but my chances are really slim against him.”

“What do you mean?” Feng Shaoyu still had no intentions of giving up.

Seeing this, Jiang Yunting explained, “If he has revealed all of his trump cards, I have about 30% odds of winning. After all, he has revealed many trump cards by far.”

“30% is too little,” Feng Shaoyu said.

“It’s not little,” Jiang Yunting said. “I would go on the stage if I had 30% odds of winning, but that is under the condition that I could block that last sword he used.”

Feng Shengling added, “He must’ve held back on that sword. Otherwise, that sword would be more powerful.”

“That’s right,” Jiang Yunting said. “That’s the key. Most importantly, since he intends to keep fighting, he must have other trump cards. This is why I said my chances are slim against him, and it’s no different from going up to get defeated.”

Jiang Yunting’s mind was sober. He was on par with Zhao Wuji. Even if he was stronger than Zhao Wuji, he wasn’t much stronger. So if he fought with Ye Qingtian, they might clash a few hundred moves if Ye Qingtian gave him face. If Ye Qingtian had no intentions of giving him face, he could end the battle within a few moves. Furthermore, that was only possible because Ye Qingtian probably had no more trump cards to keep hiding.

“What should we do, then? Are we going to watch him obtain first? Am I going to give him a sword forged by my Hidden Sword Manor just like that?” Feng Shaoyu’s face was ugly. Aside from fame, there was a reason why the Sword Assembly was so famous. The Hidden Sword Manor’s foundation was stronger than other sword dao holy lands, and the reward for being first on the Sword Assembly was generous.

“Don’t worry about it. We still have Brother Gu around,” Jiang Yunting said.

Jiang Yunting’s words woke Feng Shaoyu up, and the latter turned to look at Gu Zijing. He asked, “Old Gu, why aren’t you saying something?”

Amongst the four geniuses of the Sword Alliance, Feng Shengling was the youngest and ranked lowest. Zhao Wuji and Jiang Yunting were more or less on the same level. There was no doubt that Gu Zijing was the strongest amongst the four.

Gu Zijing looked at Ye Qingtian as though he didn’t hear what Feng Shaoyu said. He said, “I’m thinking about something.”

“What is it?”

Gu Zijing’s gaze was locked onto Ye Qingtian, and he said nothing. He was indeed thinking about something. If it was true, then Ye Qingtian’s strength could be explained. But if that were true, it would be a little too terrifying. He didn’t want to believe that there was such a genius in the world, and he couldn’t help shaking his head when he thought about it.

Since he possessed a photographic memory, he simply closed his eyes to recall the fight between Ye Qingtian and Zhao Wuji within his mind.

Seeing that Feng Shaoyu wanted to continue asking, Jiang Yunting said, “Don’t bother him for now. I roughly know what he’s thinking about. Let’s not mention the Heavenly Sealing Sword Art left behind by the Ice Emperor, Brother Gu has also reached the Sky Incineration Flames of the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword half a year ago. When Brother Gu reopens his eyes, I believe he’ll have absolute confidence in this fight.”

Feng Shaoyu rejoiced upon hearing that. He asked, “What is Old Gu thinking about?”

Not only him but everyone else within the palace turned to look at Jiang Yunting with curiosity.

Jiang Yunting said, “Ye Qingtian’s attainment in sword dao is weird. He can easily detect the flaw in his opponent’s sword techniques. He was in a dangerous situation several times, but he managed to turn the tables around like a prophet. It was weird. He held the upper hand in the fight even though he doesn’t have a high cultivation.”

Everyone in the palace came from prestigious clans or were saint disciples of the Sword Alliance. So they realized that what Jiang Yunting said was true. It was weird, now that they looked at it again.

Jiang Yunting continued, “Zhao Wuji isn’t weaker than Ye Qingtian in terms of his physique, cultivation technique, sword technique, or martial intent. He was even stronger but was still defeated, which makes it seem weird. This is the key. If you can’t figure it out, it will be hard to defeat Ye Qingtian even if you manage to withstand the Sky Incineration Flames.”

Everyone came to their senses and understood what Jiang Yunting said.

Feng Shaoyu briefly hesitated, then muttered, “That means Ye Qingtian won’t be a threat as long as you figure it out.”

“That depends. That’s the case for Gu Zijing, but it’s different for others. Take Brother Shengling, for example. He won’t be able to defeat Ye Qingtian even if he has figured it out, and he would still be defeated with one sword,” Jiang Yunting smiled.

Feng Shengling was pondering, trying to figure out Ye Qingtian’s secret, but his face became dark when he heard that. He had already maintained a low profile, so why was he mentioned?

Feng Shaoyu didn’t take it seriously and smiled, “It’s the same. I believe Brother Gu can figure it out.”

“Look, Ye Qingtian has opened his eyes!” Someone in the palace spoke out.

They were shocked that Ye Qingtian recovered from his injuries so quickly. Gu Zijing still hadn't discovered Ye Qingtian’s secret, but the latter had recovered from his injuries. His battle with Zhao Wuji was earth-shattering, and it made no sense for Ye Qingtian to recover from his injuries so quickly.

Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword as he stood on the qiongqi statue. When Lin Yun swept his gaze around, those who made eye contact with him unconsciously took a step back.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun asked, “Does anyone else want to fight me?”

Possessing the Blue Dragon Bone, Lin Yun could recover quickly and reach his peak condition. There was a commotion from the surroundings, but no one dared to stand out.

“He really wants to continue fighting!”

“Is there really no one from the Sword Alliance capable of stopping him?”

“If no one stands out, the first will be taken away.” The Sword Alliance’s geniuses were anxious as they discussed amongst themselves.

“The Cloudmist Manor hopes Gu Zijing will stand out!” Someone suddenly yelled. A disciple of the Cloudmist Manor yelled in the direction of the palace.

His voice made everyone come to their senses because there was Gu Zijing. Gu Zijing was the disciple of the Ice Emperor, and the Sword Alliance still had someone as long as he was around.

“Firmament Cloud Sect hopes Gu Zijing will stand out!”

“Aquamoon Sword Mountain hopes Gu Zijing will stand out!”

Voices reverberated, making everyone’s blood boil, forming a thunderous rumble. Everyone had placed their hopes on Gu Zijing now, and they could feel their eardrums vibrating.

“Holy shit, this is even grander than the Sword Alliance twenty years ago. Even Jian Jingtian didn’t force the Sword Alliance to this point back then.” Yun Feng was shocked as he watched this scene.

Everyone from the Sword Sect was also shocked by this scene and never expected that Ye Qingtian would manage to push the Sword Alliance this far. After all, the Sword Alliance was an alliance between eighteen sword dao holy lands.

Their gazes were complicated when they looked at Ye Qingtian. They believed that Lin Yun would have a spot in the Sword Assembly if he was still around.

Under the overwhelming voices, Gu Zijing finally opened his eyes and was slightly taken aback when he saw this scene.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Brother Gu, it’s time for you to make a move!” Feng Shaoyu cupped his fists together.

“Gu Zijing, make your move! What are you still waiting for?” Everyone else in the palace also spoke out with hope shining in their pupils.

“Let’s fight, then.” Gu Zijing spread his arms apart and descended from the palace. A strong wind blew across Gu Zijing’s face, which made his fighting spirits burn.
