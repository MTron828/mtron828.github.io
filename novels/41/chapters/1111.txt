Chapter 1112 - White Clothed Lady

Lin Yun, who was traveling down the mountain, abruptly stopped. It made Lil’ Purple speak up in confusion, “What’s wrong?”

“For some reason, I can sense someone looking at me…” Lin Yun suddenly turned around and swept his gaze around. Then, his gaze stopped on a white-clothed lady who wore a veil and was standing on a high pagoda.

But just when he was about to focus his gaze on her, she turned into a blur of light and disappeared into the distance. Before she disappeared, she turned back to look at Lin Yun, and he could tell how stunning she was from a single glance.

Lin Yun was surprised by her speed, and he didn’t know that someone was observing everything. This made him wonder if she was also a disciple in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. At the very least, he could sense that she was a lot stronger than Ye Ziling.

Lin Yun suddenly recalled Wang Yuruo words. She said that there were two people who had grasped sky sword intent among the disciples. If Ye Ziling was one of them, was the lady the second one?

Lin Yun realized that there were many crouching tigers and hidden dragons in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. After all, he knew how hard it was to grasp the sky sword intent. But he didn’t spend too much time thinking about the mysterious lady.

Lin Yun’s arrogant performance had placed immense pressure on everyone in the Flying Cloud Palace. He was destined to go down in history as an unrivaled genius in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s records. Honestly speaking, if he wasn’t arrogant, he wouldn’t be worthy of the unrivaled genius title.

Out of all the disciples, Ye Ziling’s emotions were the most complicated right now because Lin Yun had ascended the Sword Saint Mountain while in the sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Furthermore, Lin Yun still hadn’t excavated his entire potential because he had just come to Kunlun Realm.

If he wanted, he could’ve made his breakthrough to the Empyrean Realm, but he didn’t do so. Furthermore, it was weird because she couldn’t see through Lin Yun’s sword intent when her sky sword intent had reached greater mastery.

“Senior Sister, why are you staring at Senior Brother Yun? Have you fallen for him?” Wang Yuruo chuckled.

Without any change to her face, Ye Ziling replied indifferently, “I won’t fall for anyone until the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect becomes the champion in the Profound Azure Manor’s ranking battle.”

Right at this moment, the sect master descended from the sky and swept his glance around, “Disperse. From today onwards, Lin Yun will be a heavenly core disciple. Keep that in mind.”

Upon hearing that, everyone bowed and left.

“Wait for me here,” said Ye Ziling to Wang Yuruo before she soared into the sky and chased after the sect master. But the sect master was too fast and disappeared with a few flickers.

Just when Ye Ziling was feeling frustrated, her eyes suddenly lit up because she noticed that the sect master was waiting for her at the peak up ahead.

“Father!” Ye Ziling called out respectfully. Since no one was around, she didn’t need to address him so formally.

The sect master nodded his head with a smile on his face, “I know that you have many questions, but I can’t answer all of them.”

“I just want to know who he is, and why did he come to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?” Ye Ziling asked.

With a sigh, the sect master smiled, “I’m not lying to you when I say that he’s from the Heavenly Path. He also doesn’t have any objectives in coming to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, nor was it his intention. He’s only going to be here for a year before leaving.”

Only for one year? Ye Ziling was surprised to hear that and asked, “Then what was his rank in the Heavenly Path? There’s no way that he can’t make it into the top 100 or gold ranking with his strength.”

“He’s naturally not just in the gold ranking…” The sect master smiled bitterly. Lin Yun wasn’t just in the gold ranking, but he was the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path who killed five Realm Sons and crippled five other Realm Sons. Furthermore, he was a disciple that his master wanted.

Lin Yun had suppressed all the geniuses in the Ninth Heavenly Path, so there was no question that many people wanted to find him right now. However, the sect master knew that this explanation would attract too much attention from the ancient forces, so he couldn’t say anything to Ye Ziling.

Feng Jue placed Lin Yun in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect for the latter’s safety, so the sect master naturally wouldn’t leak the news. Seeing that her father only told her part of the information, Ye Ziling gave up. Knowing her father, she knew that he wouldn’t say anything else. Raising her head, she asked, “I’m curious why he didn’t make a breakthrough into the Empyrean Realm. With a holy spirit martial technique and the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, it shouldn’t be difficult for him to make it to the Empyrean Realm or even ascend the Empyrean Ranking.”

“I think I know what he’s doing. He might be thinking about planting seven Demonic Astral Flowers in each of his aura oceans before reaching the Empyrean Realm,” replied the sect master.

“H-how is that possible?” Ye Ziling was shocked when she heard that.

The limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm was known to be seven flowers. It was practically an act of defiance towards the heavens. After all, many geniuses tried to reach that legendary realm, but all of them died a terrible death. Since many people died, seven flowers slowly became a taboo. But if someone managed to succeed, there was no doubt that their strength would undergo a drastic transformation.

“Don’t be fooled by his appearance. He doesn’t fully trust the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect yet. That’s why he acted so arrogantly earlier. If there’s a chance in the future, you should try to get to know him,” said the sect master. This was the best he could do in instructing his daughter.

Lin Yun was placed in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect by Feng Jue and wasn’t told that his master was the Radiant Sword Saint. Naturally, he couldn’t trust the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“No way. H-he took advantage of me earlier.” Ye Ziling showed a trace of bashfulness on her cold face.

“Haha, he was just joking with you.” The sect master chuckled. His daughter had no idea that Lin Yun was someone who even rejected ‘that’ person’s daughter. So why would Lin Yun try to take advantage of Ye Ziling? Lin Yun was merely trying to have fun since the Heavenly Path made him so uptight.

“I-I don’t care. Father, the Profound Azure Manor’s ranking battle…” The moment Ye Ziling spoke, the sect master stopped smiling and interrupted, “I know what you’re thinking. If you want the entire Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, you can ask him yourself. I won’t help you out.”

“No way!” Ye Ziling naturally couldn’t accept it. She initially wanted her father to help negotiate with Lin Yun, so she was surprised when he rejected her.

The sect master let out a sigh because his daughter was just as prideful as he was, which wasn’t necessarily a good thing. For her sake, he didn’t mind having her suffer a little setback from Lin Yun.

“There’s more to him than what he’s shown to all of you,” said the sect master before he left.

Lin Yun returned to his residence and sat down on the stage to comprehend the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords and Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra. His greatest harvest this time was an entire set of holy spirit martial techniques that came with a sword technique and sword sutra. There was no doubt that it would be his greatest trump card in facing empyreans.

Additionally, he had the spiritual energy of the entire Sword Saint Mountain, which perfected his sky sword intent. WIth the spiritual energy from the Sword Saint Mountain, he could make a breakthrough to the Empyrean Realm directly. However, he didn’t do this because he wanted to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm.

With so much spiritual energy gathered, he felt more confident that he could reach his limit. On the other hand, he still couldn’t make a breakthrough in his sword intent. His sky sword intent had already reached a terrifying height, not to mention that it no longer had any flaws. So he could completely suppress all opponents who had the same cultivation as him.

However, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to reach a whole new level if he couldn’t make a breakthrough in it. Sword intent was differentiated into nine grades, and every three grades represented a huge threshold that even a Dragon Pulse Realm expert would have difficulty grasping. It was also the threshold that 90% of swordsmen were trapped.

As his sword intent blazed, he could faintly sense that he had touched the surface of the next grade. However, he needed to find an opportunity for the breakthrough. Raising his head, he saw Lil’ Purple pacing around in the courtyard while occasionally glancing at him. She had been this way ever since they came down from the Flying Cloud Palace.

Although Lin Yun knew that she would ultimately talk to him, he still smiled, “Lil’ Purple, you’ve been pacing around for some time now.”

Hearing that, Lil’ Purple came to a stop and spoke out unhappily, “Why didn’t you say my title earlier in the Flying Cloud Palace? Hmph! You think you can ascend the peak without my help?”

All her grievance was blatantly written on her face.

“That’s my fault.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph. Then you have to promise me that you will say my entire title whenever you’re showing off!” Lil’ Purple immediately chuckled.

“Then what if someone asks about our relationship?” Lin Yun smiled.

“You’re my servant!” Lil’ Purple declared with confidence.

Hearing that, Lin Yun instantly ignored her. Then, he raised his head, “Someone’s here.”

Not long later, Ye Ziling and Wang Yuruo walked in while Lil’ Red jumped out of Wang Yuruo’s embrace. Seeing this, Wang Yuruo smiled, “Senior Brother Yun, we’re here to deliver your cat.”

But that only lasted for a brief moment before they noticed the grumbling Lil’ Purple. Both Ye Ziling and Wang Yuruo forgot to breathe when they saw Lil’ Purple’s cuteness and temperament. They could instantly tell that Lil’ Purple would grow into a beauty in the future.

“Lady Ye, why did you come here?” Lin Yun asked while remaining seated on the stage.

Recovering from her shock, Ye Ziling looked at Lin Yun before turning to Lil’ Purple with disbelief, “Lin Yun, you’re actually rearing young girls!”

When Lin Yun heard that, his face turned dark. Then again, it made sense since Lil’ Purple was so adorable. However, that didn’t mean that he would accept this accusation, “Don’t speak nonsense.”

“Then explain your relationship with her!” Ye Ziling asked.

Her question really left Lin Yun stunned before he smiled, “You can ask her yourself.”

Glaring at Lin Yun, Ye Ziling’s gaze became gentle as she looked at Lil’ Purple, “Young sister, what’s your name?”

Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes and raised her head, “Who’s your sister? This empress is the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!”

Her lengthy title left Ye Ziling completely stunned. She initially thought that this little girl would have a simple name, but it actually turned out to be really long. When Lin Yun looked at Ye Ziling’s dumbfounded expression, he had a hard time holding in his laughter.

Squeezing out a smile, Ye Ziling persisted, “What’s your relationship with that baddie? Did he bully you?”

“He’s this empress’ servant. I can easily kill him with one finger if I want. No one in the heavens or earth can bully me. I was before heaven was created and I won’t die even if heaven is destroyed. I’m eighteen years old, with one year equaling one era!”

Lin Yun couldn’t hold back anymore. He laughed so hard, which drew a nasty look from Ye Ziling. She blamed Lin Yun for Lil’ Purple’s personality. In the end, she placed Lil’ Purple on her shoulder and looked at Lin Yun coldly, “I initially wanted to apologize to me, but I never expected that y-y-you…”

She briefly paused to find the right words and then said, “You're good for nothing!”

Lin Yun tried his best to comprehend Ye Ziling’s words. Did that mean that he had nothing aside from his good looks? That didn’t sound wrong, so Lin Yun smiled, “Thank you for your praises.”

“You!” Ye Ziling nearly threw up blood when Lin Yun acknowledged her comment in a strange way. Then, she turned around to leave, ignoring Lil’ Purple’s struggle.

“Let go of this empress or I’ll become angry!” yelled Lil’ Purple.

“This empress commands you to put me down this instant!” yelled Lil’ Purple once again. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Wuuuuuu! Lin Yun, save me! I was wrong!” Lil’ Purple struggled, but she couldn’t break free from Ye Ziling. However, Lin Yun didn’t lift a finger.

Even if he could defeat Ye Ziling, he didn’t want to make a move because Lil’ Purple needed to be taught a lesson after calling him a servant. As for her safety, he naturally had no concern because he could tell that Ye Ziling was truly concerned for her, not to mention that Lil’ Purple had the title of Heavenly Slaughter Empress.

It just so happened that he needed some peace to cultivate the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra too.

“Senior Brother Yun, can I come and play with your cat in the future?” Wang Yuruo asked, pointing at Lil’ Red.

“Didn’t you hear what your senior sister said about me?” Lin Yun smiled.

“I believe that you’re not that sort of person.” Wang Yuruo said seriously.

“Then you can come anytime you want,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Yuruo!” Ye Ziling’s enraged voice sounded out, so Wang Yuruo stuck her tongue out and left.

Looking at this scene, Lin Yun smiled. He felt that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect wasn’t so bad. At the very least, he could tell that it wouldn’t be boring here. However, he needed to find out who the lady in white was if he had time.
