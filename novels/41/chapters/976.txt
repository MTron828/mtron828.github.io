Chapter 977 - Sea of Flames

Feng Xuanyi instantly recognized the black cat as Lin Yun’s pet. After all, what were the chances of seeing another Dragon Blooded Cat?

Lil’ Red had barged in on Lin Yun’s fight with a staff covered in ancient engravings. Lil’ Red’s staff successfully threatened Feng Xuanyi as he tried to avoid a head-on collision. After all, he couldn’ risk getting badly hurt.

“Soaring Sun!” Feng Xuanyi clasped his hands together with a solemn expression. With his hands in the air, a ball of golden flames rose into the sky and lit up the entire island. A heatwave flooded the island that burned everything in a hundred mile radius. At this moment, cultivators and demonic beasts were running for their lives.

When Lil’ Red’s staff hit the blazing sun, it caused a series of explosions as fireballs hit the ground. All of the cultivators and demonic beasts that were running for their lives were killed. It was a devastating scene.

“Kill!” Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t let this opportunity go. Pushing the Cloud Soaring Art to the limit, Lin Yun charged at Feng Xuanyi who was distracted by Lil’ Red. As he charged forward, the air beneath his feet started to crack like a crumbling mountain.

When he threw his punch out, Feng Xuanyi cracked and broke into pieces. This made Lin Yun’s face change because Feng Xuanyi was already a thousand meters away. But before Feng Xuanyi could catch his breath, Lil’ Red had charged over with the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff.

Feng Xuanyi was barely capable of avoiding this attack, so he charged towards Lin Yun. When he got close to Lin Yun, his hands started forming seals as the flaming birds behind him emitted an immense flaming pressure. “Endless Current of Crows!”

With immense pressure, Feng Xuanyi sent Lin Yun flying a few hundred meters. Three palms later, the Iris Flowers on the Azure Firmament Tree flew out, signifying the separation of phenomena created by Lin Yun’s sword sutras. Attacking Lin Yun allowed Feng Xuanyi to barely avoid Lil’ Red’s attack. After all, Lil’ Red wasn’t strong enough to wield the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff comfortably.

Even when he was put in a dangerous position, Lin Yun didn’t panic as the image of Baili Qi killing the demonic fiends appeared in his mind. Lin Yun’s clothes began to flutter as he raised his head. Then, the scattered Iris Flower petals bloomed. When Lin Yun flicked his finger, wisps of sword rays shot out of the petals and towards Feng Xuanyi.

Origin energy appeared in front of Feng Xuanyi as he faced Lin Yun’s attack with a barrier. Although Lin Yun’s attacks didn’t pierce through Feng Xuanyi’s barrier, he managed to stop Feng Xuanyi from unleashing an attack.

With the phenomenon of the combined sword sutras shattered, Lin Yun focused on circulating the Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Aura. Instantly, he was coiled by a massive dragon enveloped in wind and lightning.

Then, Lin Yun charged forward inside of a massive lightning tornado. He quickly reached the origin energy barrier around Feng Xuanyi.

With a push of his palm, Lin Yun destroyed Feng Xuanyi’s barrier and forced Feng Xuanyi to retreat. Now, Feng Xuanyi would have an even harder time finding an opportunity to kill Lin Yun. Out of annoyance, Feng Xuanyi furrowed his brow.

But before he could curse, a black figure arrived in front of his chest. When he sensed the danger from the black figure, he tried to move. However, a black dagger tore apart his origin energy and left a huge wound on his chest. Feng Xuanyi had failed to notice Lil’ Red swap the staff for the dagger.

“You’re courting death!” Feeling the pain on his chest, Feng Xuanyi couldn’t help cursing. Then, he threw a punch at Lil’ Rid, which forced Lil’ Red to tumble through the air.

“Bastard, die!” Feng Xuanyi wore a sinister smile with cold light flashing through his pupils.

“How dare you!” Lightning rumbled in the sky that caused the sky to shake as a winged human appeared behind Lin Yun. When the winged human unfolded its wings, its light dyed the cloud gold while an ancient seal appeared on Lin Yun’s palm. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Then, the air began to explode under Lin Yun’s fist. Lin Yun had thrown a monarch fortune martial technique at Feng Xuanyi’s face.

“A monarch fortune martial technique!” Feng Xuanyi squinted his eyes as regret flashed in the depths of his eyes, but it was too late. He was totally unprepared to face Lin Yun’s attack.

At this moment, Feng Xuanyi spit up blood as he fell from the sky and crashed into the ground. The impact was so great that a 100 meter wide crater surrounded Feng Xuanyi. Additionally, the shockwave from the impact leveled everything within a mile radius.

As for Lin Yun, he was scarily pale. He took Feng Xuanyi’s attack head-on while immediately executing the Divine Glorysun Fist to save Lil’ Red. The exhaustion left him in a dangerous state as he was trying to suppress the turbulence in his body.

Then, Lin Yun reached out to catch Lil' Red. When Lin Yun saw Lil’ Red grimace in pain, he became enraged.

The crowd couldn’t believe what had just happened. After all, this battle had far exceeded their imagination while the shockwave alone was enough to kill them. Clearly, Lin Yun had grown strong enough to confront the seven heads.

At this moment, everyone recognized Lin Yun as the perfect dark horse. Surely, his name would shine brightly on the Heavenly Path Mirror. He even carried the weight and hope of the lower realms.

However, no one dared to utter a single word. After all, Feng Xuanyi was still alive. As one of the seven heads, there was no way Lin Yun could kill him so easily.

Then, a sea of flames soared into the sky as Feng Xuanyi flew out of the crater with rage on his face.
