Chapter 2342 - Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain

The five Golden Dao Fruits brought a massive transformation to Lin Yun’s strength, with the saint dao of his Sword Dao reaching ninety thousand. His Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent was just a step away from the actual Bright Sun Sword Intent.

He took a deep breath and couldn’t contain his emotions. He began to practice the Nirvana Sword Art, performing all six sword forms of this sword technique. The intent contained in this sword technique became even more perfect, and the power had grown by ten-odd times under the golden lotus behind him, from the first gleam of light to the eternal sword intent that shone brightly for eternity. But after an eternity, it was the end of everything.

If there was a sword that could sever eternity, would there still be an opponent that he couldn’t defeat? This was the same as pulling himself by the hair and raising him.

After performing the Nirvana Sword Art, Lin Yun felt satisfied, but he didn’t stop and performed the third section of the Divine Firefly Sword. When he was done, he finally calmed down and took out the crimson dao fruit, “There’s still the Eternal Dao Fruit.”

Lin Yun knew this Eternal Dao Fruit was meant to strengthen his Nirvana Dao. When he raised his head, he saw Lin Jiangxian was already starting to comprehend the Five Elements Dao. The phenomenon that she created was shocking. Gold, wood, water, fire, and earth had begun to intertwine, forming a scene filled with vitality.

The sword aura that Lin Jiangxian gave off was terrifying, but she couldn’t fuse them into her dao.

“It looks like even with an Eternal Dao Fruit, it’s not easy to grasp the Five Elements Dao,” Lin Yun muttered. As he had speculated, it was hard to grasp an Eternal Dao by relying on an external item. It could only assist them at most. But even so, Eternal Daos were highly precious. He spent the remaining time recollecting his thoughts and focused on refining the Eternal Dao Fruit.

Five days later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and let out a breath after refining the Eternal Dao Fruit. He executed the Nirvana Seal without hesitation and the dao flower representing Nirvana Dao appeared behind him. The aura he gave off immediately broke through the restriction of a sixth-stage Saint Lord, reaching a ninth-grade Saint Lord, and was comparable to a Saint Sovereign.

Lin Yun rejoiced because he could face Saint Sovereigns with Nirvana Dao. According to the Divine Phoenix Holy Master, the stronger their opponent, the more powerful the surrounding space would become. So, if he wanted to shatter the space-time around them, he might suffer a backlash. For example, if he used Nirvana Dao against an Emperor, it would be no different from courting death.

When the Nirvana Seal bloomed, Lin Yun stepped forth and could feel a barrier. Space-time had formed a barrier in front of him. When he stepped forth, the barrier broke, and Lin Yun could see another him when he turned around. He thrusted his sword forth and performed the first sword form of the Nirvana Sword Art, Light of the Beginning.

This was a magical experience, and he still found it magical even though he had experienced it multiple times. Nirvana Dao had five stages: Time-Space Nirvana, Samsara Nirvana, Four Seasons Nirvana, Heaven-Earth Nirvana, and Six Path Nirvana.

There were multiple units in Time-Space Nirvana. They were the thought, moment, second, and microseconds, and they represented four stages. In the past, Lin Yun could only last a few thoughts before he had to complete a nirvana. But he could last for ten now, which was a moment.

When nirvana ended, Lin Yun was devoured by sword rays upon opening his eyes. When he swung his sword, heaven ascended with earth descending. He didn’t hesitate to step back and performed Light of the Beginning.

When the two sword rays clashed, Lin Yun took five steps back before he managed to stabilize himself, but he had joy on his face. In the past, he could only thrust his sword since time was too little when performing Nirvana Dao. He couldn’t perform a complete sword technique, but it was different now.

If he ran into Wang Jue again, he could kill the latter even if the latter was protected by a divine seal and had enough time to come out.

“Time to consolidate my cultivation now.” Lin Yun had smoothly reached the sixth-stage Saint Lord, but the process was dangerous. His cultivation wasn’t stabilized. Dao fruits could also increase his cultivation, as well as comprehending dao; however, it wasn’t that obvious.

Five days later, a sword vibration echoed that alarmed Lin Yun. When he opened his eyes, he saw that Lin Jiangxian had ended her seclusion with five-colored radiance on her. When the aura swept out, her sword aura turned into a dazzling pillar of light that lit up the sky. The sword intent and aura she gave off were two times stronger than before, becoming deep and unfathomable. But it was a pity that she still couldn’t grasp the Five Elements Dao.

Lin Jiangxian looked around and saw Lin Yun before coming over.

“How is it?” Lin Yun smiled.

“My sword intent and Five Elements Dao have greatly improved, but it’s a pity that I still can’t grasp it,” Lin Jiangxian said.

Lin Yun already noticed that, so he comforted, “You still lack an opportunity. It’s hard to grasp an Eternal Dao when relying on external items.”

“Yeah. But there’s also a surprise, I’ve become a seventh-stage Saint Lord,” Lin Jiangxian smiled.

Lin Yun was alarmed, then noticed that the aura given off by Lin Jiangxian had become more refined. It was no wonder why Lin Jiangxian gave him a deep and unfathomable feeling.

Rubbing his nose, Lin Yun smiled, “I was planning to comfort you, but it looks like you don’t need any comfort.”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lin Jiangxian was briefly stunned, before she smiled, “You really know how to joke around.”

It looks like Lin Yun still didn’t know the shock the golden lotus brought to her and Xiong Tiannan. After all, that golden lotus was more terrifying than a seventh-stage Saint Lord. Not many could condense their dao flower into a golden lotus before becoming a Saint Sovereign.

“I’m not joking around,” Lin Yun said sincerely. Earlier, when he fought with Wang Jue, he knew how terrifying a seventh-stage Saint Lord was, and even used the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron when they clashed for the first time. It had been a long time since Lin Yun had such a dangerous experience. If it weren’t for that, he wouldn’t have taken the risk to make a breakthrough to the sixth-stage Saint Lord.

“Most people are afraid of the tribulation since they would die if they weren’t careful,” Lin Jiangxian explained. “There aren’t many people afraid of death before the Saint Realm. But many people would lose their courage after reaching the Saint Realm. The more afraid they became, the higher their odds of losing.”

Lin Yun nodded, “Yeah. The more you have, the more you’re afraid to lose them.”

Lin Jiangxian looked at Lin Yun, and said, “But you don’t lack that courage because swordsmen are never afraid.”

“That’s because I have a reason that I must do it,” Lin Yun replied. As they talked, Ji Zixi and Xiong Tiannan also woke up with a significant boost in their strengths. The four didn’t hesitate and journeyed to Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain.

Heavenly Barren City was located at the heart of this Heavenly Barren Secret Realm and was the oldest city. There were geniuses gathered from various realms in this city, and divine disciples who were normally hard to see could be found quite commonly here.

Aside from that, there were also disciples from ancient Divine Saint Clans. They had ancestors who became a deity, thus having the deity’s bloodline flowing through their veins.

Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain was at the end of this city. At this moment, four figures were walking on the streets of this city. One looked to be in his late twenties, having exquisite features and giving off an oppressive aura. On his right was a robust man, wearing a playful and weird expression. The remaining two were beauties, each having a unique temperament. The one on the left felt like an iceberg, while the one on the right looked innocent.

They were naturally Lin Yun’s group of four. Ji Zixi and Lin Jiangxian were beauties, naturally attracting much attention along the way. But no one dared to make a move since this city had gathered geniuses from various realms, and who knew if they might have a terrifying background.

“Are we going straight to Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain?” Xiong Tiannan asked. They hadn’t had the time to rest since they had just arrived. But Xiong Tiannan asked after discovering that Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain was opened.

“Let’s immediately head there,” Lin Yun nodded.

Heavenly Barren City was filled with people, all heading in a single direction, where a towering mountain was located.

“Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain has a total of three stages. If one can make it through the three stages, they will have the opportunity to meet the ancestral deity,” Lin Jiangxian said. The Heavenly Baren Realm was divided into nine areas, and each secret realm would have ten quotas. From there, the ancestral deity would accept ten people as his disciples. As for everyone else, they could become his outer disciples.

Powerhouses that reached the Ancestral Realm were so mighty that even deities would fear them.

“I heard that this ancestral deity is acquainted with the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity,” Lin Jiangxian turned to look at Lin Yun.
