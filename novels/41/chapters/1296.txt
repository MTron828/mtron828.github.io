Chapter 1297 - White-Haired Youth

“Rise!” When Lin Yun raised his head, the saint runes on the altar began to shine and a blade appeared under a boundless light.

“Snow Heed!” Lin Yun saw that the sword had ‘Snow Heed’ engraved on it, and there was also an ancient seal.

“Let me see…” Lil’ Purple took the blade and examined it before she said in a disappointed tone, “It doesn’t have a spirit, but it’s still a thousand-rune saint artifact. Mhm?”

Lin Yun retrieved all the Divine Astral Pellets that were on the altar as sacrifices. This meant that he had obtained another million Divine Astral Pellets. When he saw the complicated expression on Lil’ Purple’s face, he asked, “What’s wrong?”

“I think I know who they were…” Lil’ Purple said in a sorrowful voice.

“Who were they?” Lin Yun was baffled, but he knew that Lil’ Purple was talking about those Demonic Corpses.

“They should belong to the descendants of a branch from the Dragon Gate. This blade might have been prepared for the god battle at that time, but it’s a pity that they all died without being able to use this sword,” said Lil’ Purple softly.

Lin Yun knew about the ancient god battle. After all, the golden era came to an end with the battle, and the Divine Dragon Era underwent a long and dark era until the Nine Emperors appeared to end that dark era.

“Lin Yun, can I have this blade?” Lil’ Purple asked while she raised her head to look at him.

Lowering his head to look at Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun could tell that she was sad. He smiled. “Of course, you can, as long as you’re happy. No matter what, we won the god battle, so there’s no need for you to be too sad.”

“Did we really win?” Lil’ Purple asked with a doubtful expression.

“We won many times, but that time…” Lil’ Purple had flashbacks as if she was back in ancient times before she continued in a sad voice, “Many of us agreed to head to the god battle to protect the Kunlun Realm. I remembered that I promised someone, but I wasn’t able to go. So I have no idea how the god battle ended…”

Lin Yun knew that Lil’ Purple had slept for too long and forgotten about many things. So when her emotions were stirred like they were today, she would recall bits and pieces. As Lil’ Purple hugged the blade, she continued, “We had an alliance from the start of the era, and we won many times. I remember that we were waiting for someone, but the Iris Sword Saint told me that that person won’t be coming back…”

“So… who’s that person?” Lin Yun asked. He was curious about who that person was for everyone back in the golden era to place their hopes on, but Lil’ Purple only replied by shaking her head. Seeing this, Lin Yun no longer pursued her about it and persuaded her, “Since he said that he’ll come back, then he will definitely come back.”

“Perhaps…” Lil’ Purple smiled and recollected herself.

Right at that moment, Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple turned to look at each other when footsteps resounded behind them. The three sects were coming, and they were really fast. Looked like they were really lucky, but they didn’t pick the life path.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun yelled before he and Lil’ Red headed to the fourth level. But who knew that the entrance of the fourth level was like a bottomless pit? No matter how he tried, he couldn’t stop spinning in the abyss, and he couldn’t even summon the pair of wings behind him.

But he didn’t hesitate to reach out to grab Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red into his embrace. No matter what, his physique was comparable to a thousand-rune saint artifact, and he would only lose a layer of skin at worst and wouldn’t be heavily injured.

When Lin Yun’s foot firmly landed on the ground, the ground began to violently tremble. After raising his head, he found himself in a spacious world, and the height of the roof was as high as the sky.

“Are you alright?” Lin Yun asked Lil’ Purple, who was in his embrace.

Lil’ Purple nodded her head and pointed in a certain direction. “Over there!”

When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see a towering altar that reached a thousand feet, and there was a black-clothed elder seated on the altar. He was giving off an aura of deathly stillness that enveloped this entire space, and he was also giving off a dense demonic aura.

This scene made Lin Yun lock his brows together because the aura this elder was giving off was a lot stronger than the Samsara Edict Realm experts, and this meant that this person was at least in the quasi-Saint Realm when he was alive.

The Great Saint Origin could only be refined by Samsara Edict Realm experts or saints. But there weren’t that many restrictions for a quasi-saint origin. It could be refined at the Elysium Core Realm, and transcendent geniuses could refine them perfectly with their foundation.

So a quasi-saint origin had a great temptation to any transcendent genius. This made Lin Yun squint his eyes because it was also tempting to him, even if he was only at the Galaxy Stage. Right at this moment, he suddenly thought of something and said, “This person should’ve been a hero when he was alive. Isn’t it rude of us to kill him again?”

“Being corroded by demonic aura is more painful than death to them,” said Lil’ Purple while she shook her head.

Then again, what she said did make sense. If he was corroded by demonic aura one day and turned his sword to his own race, he would also hope that he could be free of the torture as soon as possible. But even so, Lin Yun still gave the demonic corpse a bow of respect.

“Sorry about this.” Lin Yun said before unleashing his sword intent and azure dragon aura before he approached the demonic corpse. At the same time, the quasi-saint seemed to still have an intent or some sort resistance against the demonic aura even after death. He didn’t seem to be completely corroded by demonic aura yet, and Lin Yun didn’t release his firmament sword intent when he saw this, fearing that something unexpected might happen.

But just when he was about to get close, he could feel a slight tremor coming from the ground behind him. When he turned around, he could see a white-haired youth standing on a statue wielding a blade. He wasn’t from the three sects, but a complete stranger. But when Lin Yun saw this person, he suddenly exclaimed, “It’s you!”

Lin Yun recognized this person because it was said that the saint elixir born on the island belonging to the Sword Sect was snatched by a white-haired youth, and Lin Yun had a strong feeling that it was this person before him. It was so much so that the seal on the underground palace might have been opened by this person, and he had been ahead of everyone. But his attainment in fengshui wasn’t as strong as Lin Yun’s, and this was why he was one step slower than Lin Yun.

“You know me?” The white-haired youth was confused. Could it be that the person behind the mask was someone he knew? Seeing that the mask seemed to be produced by the Mo Clan, that might really be possible.

“I don’t know you, but you’re the one who snatched the saint elixir from the Sword Sect. So I’ve heard of you, even if I don’t know about you,” said Lin Yun.

The white-haired youth instantly understood why Lin Yun recognized him. But he didn’t deny it and said, “I want the thing on the altar.”

When he was done, he faced the demonic aura head-on and dashed to the altar.

His action briefly surprised Lin Yun, but he quickly formed a seal with his hands and no longer held his strength back. As golden light bloomed from his back and manifested into a pair of wings, suddenly boosting his speed.

Just like that, the two of them were like a golden and white streak of light heading for the altar. They both practically landed on the altar at the same time, and when they landed, a violent gale blew that made their hairs flutter in the wind.

“Looks like we have a fight between us,” said the white-haired youth.

“I don’t think there’s another alternative,” said Lin Yun with his brow raised. He had gotten here with great difficulty, so it was impossible for him to let go of the treasures on the altar.

But the white-haired youth didn’t draw his sword and merely threw a punch out. Accompanied by his punch was a roc that made Lin Yun surprised because the white-haired youth’s holy spirit was actually the roc.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun executed the Heaven and Earth Unity of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. When a golden crow and silver phoenix flew out from his body, they converged on his fist while he threw his punch out. When the two punches collided, a terrifying power swept out, accompanied by all sorts of phenomena.

When all the phenomena disappeared, they both took several steps back and were both surprised. Lin Yun wore a grave expression because he could sense that this white-haired youth wasn’t any weaker than the transcendent geniuses from the eight powerful sects, and this meant that this person was a strong opponent.

In the next second, the two clashed once more, and draconic roars could be heard echoing from the altar. They had already exchanged hundreds of moves in the blink of an eye, and each of their collisions was like two dragons clashing together, unleashing terrifying energy fluctuations onto the altar.

When they separated, they still couldn’t determine the victor between them. Lin Yun was shining with purple-golden light and had no idea where the hell this white-haired youth came from to have such a powerful physique. Ever since he achieved the Innate Azure Dragon Saint Physique, he had never encountered anyone amongst the same generation that could face him head-on.

The white-haired youth also lightly furrowed his brows with his right hand resting on the hilt of his blade. In the next second, his temperament had undergone a huge transformation and became sharp. This instantly made Lin Yun feel a chill down his spine because the white-haired youth was giving off an extremely dangerous aura. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The white-haired youth hadn’t drawn his sword yet, but he could see countless figures soaring into the sky performing countless attacks with the blade. But when he looked at the white-haired youth again, the white-haired youth was still standing there. At the same time, the white-haired youth’s voice resounded, “You still have the chance to give up before I draw my blade.”

Lin Yun responded with the Flower Burial Sword flying from his sword box and into his hand. Wearing a smile, Lin Yun returned the white-haired youth’s words back to him, “You also have the chance to give up before I draw my sword.”

He was feeling both nervous and excited at the same time. If the white-haired youth thought that he could intimidate him with just this much, then the white-haired youth was looking down on him too much.
