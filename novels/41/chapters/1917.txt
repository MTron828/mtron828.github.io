Chapter 1918 - One Finger!

The Heavenly Dao Sect had a comprehensive collection of martial techniques. Countless ghost spirit martial techniques were rare in the outside world, and Lin Yun had witnessed ten-odd ghost spirit martial techniques in just a short moment. This was an eye-opening experience for him.

It didn’t take long for Ye Feifan to ascend the stage. In the Earth category, Ye Feifan only used three moves to resolve his opponent, and his opponent was an older generation’s saint disciple in the same cultivation.

“What is a monstrous genius? He is a monstrous genius!”

“Ye Feifan can make it into the top three, at the very least!”

After defeating his opponent in three moves, Ye Feifan became the center of attention. When he came down the platform, he smugly looked at Lin Yun. As their gazes bumped together, Ye Feifan smiled, “Brother, it’s too late for you to regret it now. No one can save you even if your master is here!”

Hearing that the Dragon Origin Great Saint was here, Lin Yun raised his head and sensed several saint auras being emitted from the Heavenly Dao Sect.

He was surprised that the Dragon Origin Great Saint was here. Was the Dragon Origin Great Saint afraid that he would be killed here?

When Ye Feifan saw Ye Qingtian was silent, he thought the latter was afraid and left laughing aloud.

Lin Yun retracted his gaze and continued to observe the surrounding battles. He must admit that the Heavenly Dao Sect’s saint disciples were extraordinary. Even the older generation saint disciples he looked down on were outstanding and left him a deep impression.

As he observed their fights, he deduced their moves with the golden human within his sword sea. When his Sword Heart throbbed, Lin Yun multitasked and observed multiple battles simultaneously.

Multiple opponents suddenly appeared before the golden human within the Sword Sea. As they fought, Lin Yun was like a sponge absorbing experiences from their fights and turning them into his comprehension. After all, Lin Yun was a single person, even if he was strong.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Dao Sect’s saint disciples were strong, especially the saint’s disciples. This was a great feeling because his comprehension of sword dao increased without doing anything. Others could also do the same, but they couldn’t multitask since they didn’t have a Sword Heart, not to mention some were aloof and looked down on everyone else.

“Gold category, 59 VS 60!” Chi Yun said, and a figure flew to the stage. This person was Zhang Qiao, and he was a bladesman that was emitting an overbearing aura. He was also an older generation saint disciple, and everyone was curious about his opponent. If it was a young saint disciple, they would probably be defeated because not even a saint’s disciple might be unable to defeat Zhang Qiao.

After all, Zhang Qiao’s cultivation was at the pinnacle second transformation of the Nirvana Stage, practicing the Witherwood Blade Art. He was pretty famous amongst the older generation saint disciples.

“Your opponent is me.” A figure flew to the stage.

“It’s Ye Qingtian!”

“That fellow finally went on the stage, and his opponent is strong right from the start.”

“Hehe. Ye Qingtian mocked Zhang Qiao earlier. We now have a show to watch.” Ye Qingtian’s appearance immediately drew a lot of attention. After all, Ye Qingtian was famous recently, and it was impossible for no one to have heard of Ye Qingtian’s name.

But only some people were optimistic about him because his cultivation needed to be higher. Ye Qingtian was a newly conferred saint disciple at the Profound Death Stage, and everyone felt that anyone within the Di Group could easily crush him to death.

“Indigo Thunder Peak’s Ye Qingtian!” Lin Yun said, standing on the stage facing Zhang Qian.

“Heavenly Aquatic Peak’s Zhang Qiao!” Zhang Qiao smiled. He was surprised by Ye Qingtian’s appearance, but he was soon filled with excitement. He eerily smiled, “A lot of people want to fight you in the Di Group, but I never expected to run into you. Ye Qingtian, you have no idea how many people hate you!”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Senior Brother Zhang, quickly cripple him. Don’t allow him to admit defeat!”

“Right, don’t allow him to admit defeat. Someone like him should be expelled from the sect!”

“Cripple him!” An uproar burst out amongst the crowd.

“See, what did I say?” Zhang Qiao smiled.

“You’re really confident?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Why shouldn’t I be confident? Many people don’t even have the opportunity to step on you,” Zhang Qiao said indifferently.

“Then rejoice while you still can, because you will be defeated very quickly,” Lin Yun replied.

Zhang Qiao’s face became dark, and he coldly said, “You still dare to be so cocky when you’re at my mercy.”

Zhang Qiao drew his blade and unleashed a powerful gale. He wanted to suppress Ye Qingtian with his cultivation in one move, but Ye Qingtian appeared before him before the wind could even rise.

The gale he created was mighty, creating several marks on the ground. It was a pity that al of the attacks missed, and landed behind Ye Qingtian.

Ye Qingtian reached out with one finger and gently shoved it into Zhang Qiao’s chest. Before Zhang Qiao could even unleash his nirvana aura, he was pushed ten feet away, throwing out a mouthful of blood when he landed.

Zhang Qiao lowered his head in shock because there was a massive hole in his chest with blood flowing out. Ye Qingtian’s finger pushed him away and even created a hole in his chest. Naturally, this left him greatly shocked because he never expected Ye Qingtian to be so strong.

He would've lost to that finger if it weren’t for his powerful cultivation. But Lin Yun flicked a finger in his direction before he could recover from his shock, unleashing a sword ray, and Zhang Qiao’s blade was sent flying away.

“My blade…” When Zhang Qiao shifted his gaze away, Ye Qingtian’s sword was already placed on his forehead, and this instantly made Zhang Qiao’s face become pale.

On the other hand, Lin Yun stood with his hands behind him and indifferently said, “If this was a life-and-death battle, you'd already be dead.”

Zhang Qiao lost too quickly before anyone could respond, and everyone was shocked as they looked at Ye Qingtian with disbelief.

“How did he manage to do it?” Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan were shocked. They both trounced their opponents, but never expected Ye Qingtian to beat Zhang Qiao so easily. They initially thought anyone could easily trounce Ye Qingtian, but that didn’t seem to be the case now.

The cultivation Ye Qingtian revealed was at the fifth channel of the Profound Death Stage, while his opponent was Zhang Qiao, who was at the second transformation of the Nirvana Stage. It made no sense for Zhang Qiao to be suppressed by Ye Qingtian. Even if Ye Qingtian could win, it should be a tough battle, and he should at least suffer some injuries.

Even the Saint Elders were surprised by this scene. With their cultivation, they could naturally see more information during this fight. There was a massive difference between the Profound Death Stage and Nirvana Stage.

It wasn’t surprising for someone at the first transformation to defeat someone at the third transformation, but it was surprising that someone at the Profound Death Stage defeated an opponent at the Nirvana Stage.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint was the most shocked because he never expected Ye Qingtian to be so strong despite knowing that the latter wasn’t simple. After he was shocked, the Dragon Origin Great Saint immediately rejoiced.

“Not bad…” The Dragon Origin Great Saint said with a proud expression because Ye Qingtian was his disciple.

“Congratulations on having such a genius as your disciple!”

“It has been a few hundred years since you last took a disciple, but it looks like you have chosen a great disciple.”

“I also wanted to take him in as my disciple after the conferring ceremony, but it was a pity that I hesitated…”

“The phenomena created at that time were shocking, but it was too pitiful that this person was too notorious. If he wasn’t still as cocky as before at the conferring ceremony, I would’ve taken him as my disciple.”

“Dragon Origin Great Saint, if you have no time to teach him, you can give him to me for a few days.”

“That’s right. I can also teach him as well. He’s a crude jade that needs tempering.” Some Saint Elders congratulated, while some Saint Elders found it a pity.

“Don’t even try. That brat is now my direct disciple.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint barked, seeing so many people interested in Lin Yun.

Only the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign’s face was cold, bearing all the rage within.
