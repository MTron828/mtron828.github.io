Chapter 1996 - Sword of the Beginning!

Thirty experts with experts on the King Ranking like Ye Qinghong, Zhang Kui, and Xiao Jingyan. This made the conceited Bai Qingyu nervous and uneasy.

After all, geniuses on the King Ranking, like those three, were much stronger than the Third Master Lei of the Thunder Eagle Stronghold. They practiced ghost spirit cultivation techniques, high-grade ghost spirit martial techniques, and various techniques from their clans. They were blessed with extraordinary talent and have cultivated within the holy land ever since they were young. Thus, their foundation was much stronger than others.

“H-How dare you guys try to kill a Great Saint’s secluded disciple! Aren’t you guys afraid of being in trouble?!” Bai Qingyu said uneasily.

“This is the Myriad Graves Valley, not the Heavenly Dao Sect. It’s normal for a person or two to die. Haven’t you been saying that you wanted to take Ye Qingtian’s head?” Ye Qinghong grinned. “This is a good opportunity for you. We can just say that Ye Qingtian killed you, and we took revenge for you. Who knows, the Bai Clan will have to thank us for it.”

Bai Qingyu’s face became pale because she never expected these people to be so shameless. She immediately regretted it. She knew she was the reason why Ye Qingtian’s location was exposed.

But Lin Yun was calmly looking at Xiao Jingyan and fell into deep thought.

Bai Qingyu gritted her teeth and said, “Ye Qingtian, I’ll take responsibility for this. I won’t hold you down. Leave first and take revenge for me later!”

She had some grace from her elder sister based on that courage alone. A violent sword aura spread when she drew the Stalewater Sword and activated the two glory spirits.

“Nether Orchid Valley!” Bai Qingyu executed the high-grade ghost spirit martial technique of the Nether Orchid Courtyard, the Nether Orchid Sword Technique. The two glory spirits ignited the surrounding spiritual energy and manifested into a massive ocean with a serene valley on it. As Bai Qingyu charged at the three, she released her constellation, a majestic moon.

“The Stalewater Sword!” Ye Qinghong and Zhang Kui’s faces changed. They didn’t place Bai Qingyu in their eyes but have heard of the Stalewater Sword’s reputation.

“Let me face her!” Xiao Jingyan smiled and released his nirvana aura, forming black flames in his palm. As he stepped forth, the flames in his palm expanded a thousand times in size, “Netherworld Ghost Flame!”

It was like a cauldron with flames gushing out, enveloping Bai Qingyu. The petals that appeared from executing the Nether Orchid Sword Technique disappeared, and cracks also appeared on the phenomenon created by the Stalewater Sword.

Bai Qingyu immediately poured her nirvana aura into the two glory spirits, and her sword shone brightly with a boundless vitality surging forth. Under the boundless vitality, the black flames began to wither like flowers, creating a bizarre scene. When the flames dissipated, Xiao Jingyan’s punch landed on the sword, and the sheer force behind his punch sent Bai Qingyu flying back by ten meters.

The Stalewater Sword continued to tremble, and Bai Qingyu’s pupils were shocked. Her cultivation was one transformation higher than Xiao Jingyan, but the latter’s nirvana aura far exceeded her expectations. If it weren’t for the Stalewater Sword, she would probably have been heavily injured from that punch alone. Is this the true strength of Xiao Jingyan?

Xiao Jingyan’s strength also surprised Lin Yun. The former stood mid-air and said, “I’ll be honest with you. I was already in the top hundredths of the King Ranking half a year ago, and I will reach the top ten if my cultivation takes a step further. Ye Qingtian, if you’re smart, you will reveal your objective in coming to the Myriad Graves Valley and the secret of your sudden boost in strength. I’m interested in that saint origin you refined!”

Truth be told, everyone within the Heavenly Dao Sect was curious about the saint origin that Ye Qingtian refined. Many people speculated that it might be a Great Saint’s saint origin. Otherwise, it made no sense for Ye Qingtian to improve so quickly.

Zhang Kui coldly said, “Ye Qingtian, you have yet to fully refine the saint origin, right? Hand it over, and we’ll give you an easy death without suffering.”

“I have a Great Saint’s saint origin, yet to refine fully it. It’s in my heart, so you guys can try digging it out, if you guys can,” Lin Yun smiled. Not only did he possess a Great Saint’s saint origin, but he also had a Divine Dragon Bone.

Greed flashed within Ye Qinghong’s pupils when he heard that. He smiled, “So it’s really the saint origin of a Great Saint. The Azure River Sword Saint must’ve gotten it for you, but it’s mine now!”

Ye Qinghong spread his arms apart and flew towards Lin Yun, releasing his constellation. This instantly boosted his cultivation, which was already at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. His constellation was a black saint sword that emitted a powerful sword aura.

Lin Yun found the sword rather familiar and muttered, “Dao Sword!”

The Heavenly Dao Sect had two divine swords, the Heavenly Sword and the Dao Sword. Many people would observe them when forming their constellations, but how powerful their constellations could become depended on the individual.

“Ye Qingtian, bring out your constellation as well. We can’t have fun in the sect, but we can have fun now!” Ye Qinghong charged at Ye Qingtian with his boosted aura.

“I don’t need to bring out my constellation to kill you,” Lin Yun said.

“Ha!” Ye Qinghong sneered. His body began to blaze like a sun, and sword rays that were a hundred feet long flew out as he swung his sword. It looked as though he had thrown a sun out. This was the Dao Yang Sword Sutra, the inheritance cultivation technique of the Dao Yang Palace. Paired with his cultivation at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, the power of his attack was immense.

Even Lin Yun was surprised by the power of Ye Qinghong’s attack. The Dao Yang Sword Sutra was truly powerful, and he couldn’t underestimate it. Because of the disadvantage of his cultivation, he could only dodge and not face it head-on.

“Hehe. Ye Qingtian, weren’t you really cocky within the sect?” Ye Qinghong laughed, seeing that Ye Qingtian didn’t dare to face him head-on, and he finally vented all the resentment he had in his heart.

As Lin Yun dodged Ye Qinghong’s attacks, he flicked out several sword rays.

“Dao!” Just when the sword rays were about to reach Ye Qinghong, Ye Qinghong roared, and a ‘Dao’ word flew out before the sword rays could close, blocking the incoming sword rays. The collision produced a series of collision sounds, leaving faint ripples in the surrounding air.

After ten-odd moves, Ye Qinghong’s aura grew even stronger. His attacks made Lin Yun dodge left and right, and the fluctuation even left several wounds on him. But Ye Qingtian was coming out unscathed, not even a strand of hair was damaged.

“Hahaha! Ye Qingtian, is this the best you can do? Give me your best!” Ye Qinghong laughed.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Lin Yun did as he wished and drew his sword, unleashing a sword ray that could slice apart heaven and earth. Before the ‘Dao’ could fully bloom, a red line appeared on Ye Qinghong’s neck, and his head flew away. Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun calmly said, “I still have a lot of abilities, but it’s a pity that you can’t see them anymore.”

Lin Yun had used Light of the Beginning, and this feat shocked the experts from the three clans as fear was projected in their pupils. They couldn’t believe that someone like Ye Qinghong was killed with one sword.

“Light of the Beginning!” Xiao Jingyan and Zhang Kui responded first as they looked at Ye Qingtian with shock. They naturally knew about that sword rumored to be legendary in the sect. But Ye Qingtian had only used it once, and many people subconsciously forgot about it. Because of that, a saint disciple, a genius of an Ancient Saint Clan, was killed.

“I’ll deal with him!” Xiao Jingyan frowned with rage blazing within his pupils. Ye Qinghong was too useless. Ye Qinghong got too cocky before the battle ended, but he believed that Ye Qingtian must’ve exhausted himself after unleashing that attack earlier, and this was the perfect moment to kill him.
