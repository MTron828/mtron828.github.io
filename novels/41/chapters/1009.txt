Chapter 1010 - Elysium Trigram War Realm, Profound lightning Dual Swords

Lin Yun was pretty surprised to see the familiar person. It was a young lady who emitted elegance through her eyes. At this moment, she was donned in blue clothes and her hair was tied together. Such a disguise was pretty common in the Heavenly Path, so it wasn’t surprising to see.

She was a bewitching woman who could captivate the souls of others with her smile. But now, her temperament had undergone a transformation as she became insignificant among the crowd. The reason why Lin Yun was able to recognize her was because he had interacted with her several times.

But her disguise instantly left Lin Yun baffled. Is she in trouble? Is that why she’s wearing a disguise? Clearly, Luo Chen had recognized her, but he signaled Lin Yun not to make a scene.

“That’s Pei Xue?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s her. I heard that she’s the reason why there’s a lockdown. Apparently, she has a treasure that can change the ranking of the final battle. That’s the reason why she was in the Azure Dragon Region. It seems like the war realms were tempted by her treasure,” explained Luo Chen.

Lin Yun was greatly shocked when he heard that. He couldn’t believe that the war realms actually caused such a huge mess just for her treasure. He began to wonder how great the treasure was that even the War Realms would risk offending all of the realms.

“She’s not from a War Realm?” Lin Yun asked.

“No, by the looks of it, she has a deep connection with one of the war realms. Otherwise, there’s no way she would make it this far. I have some speculation about her origin, but I don’t dare to believe it,” replied Luo Chen.

“What speculation?” questioned Lin Yun.

“It’s just a speculation. Plus, I’m not in the position to speak about it. No matter what happens, don’t interfere. There’s a reason why the war realms are called forbidden existences. You’re alone, so it’s best for you to keep your composure and not draw their attention,” continued Luo Chen.

The massive party headed towards the Four Phase City. Everyone was uneasy, but none of them were afraid. After all, they believed that the War Realms wouldn’t dare to make an enemy out of this many people. Suddenly, two bolts of lightning streaked across the horizon. When the bolts of lightning got close, everyone felt fear in their hearts from the immense pressure.

Then, a brilliant sword buzz echoed in the horizon as boundless bolts of lightning formed two swords. The swords emitted an intense aura as azure figures appeared before the swords. When the wind blew past, everyone could see two people hovering in mid-air.

Both of them emitted an immense sword aura combined full of lightning. Then, a scream sounded out as cultivators were blown away by the force of the sword aura. Just like that, thousands of people who were at the front were heavily injured and blown backwards.

When they landed on the ground, they were either on their knees or lying on the ground. No one could get up as blood trickled out of their mouths. Lin Yun could see this scene clearly as surprise flashed in his eyes. Was this the power of geniuses from War Realms? As a swordsman, he could easily tell that those two had grasped spiritual sword intent and were proficient in lightning sword aura.

Unlike Lin Yun, the lightning aura they emitted was extremely pure and profound. They must have cultivated an ancient lightning sword sutra that was at least an imperial fortune cultivation technique. Additionally, they must’ve taken a thousand-year-old herb similar to the Imperial Sword Herb. Otherwise, their sword intent wouldn’t be refined to such a dense level.

Lin Yun quickly came to the conclusion that if he didn’t grasp the sky sword intent and the fortune in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, his sword intent would be suppressed right now. When Lin Yun came to this conclusion, he was startled by the foundation of a war realm.

The two people stood on their dao artifacts with lightning flowers formed around them. With just their aura, they managed to suppress a large portion of the attack formation.

“They’re the Profound Lightning Twin Swords!”

“The Profound Lightning Twin Swords of the Elysium Trigram War Realm, Mo Xuan and Han Lei!” Many people exclaimed with fear in their eyes because they recognized their attackers. They were two geniuses from the Elysium Trigram War Realm.

“Profound Lightning Twin Swords, how long are you going to trap us for?!” Someone spoke up furiously because they were trapped for over half a month. They were confident that they could take on the Profound Lightning Twin Swords with the crowd on their side.

Mo Xuan spoke indifferently, “There’s someone we’re looking for.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Let us pass! We want to reach the Four Phase City!” Someone took the lead to sound their unhappiness. After all, it was dangerous in the Yellow Sandy Plain with demonic cultivators around and the disastrous environment. No one wanted to stay here for long.

“We’ve already set up an array. What if the one we’re looking for runs off while you go past?” asked Han Lei.

“Then how long are you going to trap us for?” Someone roared unhappily.

“Wait,” said Mo Xuan. “The young masters have already searched the other regions and all we have left is the Yellow Sandy Plain and Northern Ridge Plain. The one we’re looking for is in one of these regions. After we finish searching the Northern Ridge Plain, it’ll be your turn. Half a month will be enough.”

Lin Yun noticed the mention of young masters, which meant that more than one war realm was involved in the lockdown. When Lin Yun took a peek at Pei Xue, he noticed that Pei Xue, who was in disguise, revealed uneasiness in her eyes.

“Bullshit! Do you bastards think you’re the kings around here? No one can stop me if I want to pass!” Someone spoke up as he ran out of patience. But the moment he opened his mouth, a boundless sword intent exploded from Mo Xuan. When he pointed his finger out, a head went flying. The war realms were strong enough to kill a genius in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm with one finger.

“A mere ant dares to be rude to the young master?” Mo Xuan said indifferently with a cold expression.

Lin Yun’s heart sank because Mo Xuan’s sword aura was like fine silk, which was similar to his Three Heavenly Divides, Lightning Cocoon. Unfortunately for the crowd, Mo Xuan executed it too easily.

“Junior Brother!” Several voices sounded out as they looked at the two people with rage blazing in their pupils. Mo Xuan and Han Lei were simply too brutal to kill someone just because they voiced their unhappiness.

“Get revenge for junior brother!” A small group lost their rationale at this moment. But it was a pity that they were too weak. Mo Xuan simply pushed his palm down, which made it feel like the entire sky was collapsing. In a second, the group was squashed.

When everyone looked at Mo Xuan again, they could see ancient lightning runes blooming in his aura oceans. This was a secret technique to strengthen aura oceans. Although it wasn’t comparable to the Demonic Astral Flowers, it was still pretty strong and could easily suppress those in the same cultivation. On top of that, Mo Xuan had cultivated imperial fortune cultivation techniques. Right from the start, there was no way the small group could compete with Mo Xuan.

Even Lin Yun felt that they were too much. There was no need to kill so many people if they wanted to make an example. Among those in the same cultivation, a swordsman always had the advantage in the fight, not to mention a monstrous genius like Mo Xuan.

As a swordsman, Lin Yun knew how terrifying the Profound Lightning Twin Swords were. Lin Yun wasn’t a benevolent person because he had killed many people, but he wasn’t a bloodthirsty person either.

Han Lei closed his eyes as if he was receiving a transmission. When he opened them again, his gaze flashed coldly, “The person we’re looking for isn’t in the Northern Ridge Plain. So none of you are allowed to leave!”

Since the strength Mo Xuan and Han Lei revealed was too strong, the crowd became quiet. All of them swallowed their saliva and didn’t dare to say a single word in fear of being killed.

Logically speaking, there was no way that Mo Xuan and Han Lei could face over ten thousand people by themselves. However, the crowd was pacified because of their decisiveness.

At this moment, Pei Xue wasn’t moving. Despite looking calm and composed on the surface, she was feeling very uneasy. She knew that she would have no chance to escape if the geniuses from the other war realms arrived.

“The person we’re looking for is among this crowd.” Mo Xuan and Han Lei began to sweep their gaze around.

“You, come out!” Right now, Mo Xuan and Han Lei were searching for suspicious people. As for those who were unwilling to step forward, they were naturally killed without any hesitation.

Fear quickly spread around among the tens of thousands of people as individuals were being singled out. But Mo Han and Han Lei couldn’t be bothered as they were certain that the person they were looking for was here.

Those who were being suspected trembled as they walked out from the crowd. It didn’t take long for over a hundred people to be called.

“You, come out!” Suddenly, Han Lei’s gaze fell onto the disguised Pei Xue. But before Lin Yun could feel shocked, he was called out by Mo Xuan. Evidently, he was also suspicious.
