Chapter 1226 - So What If I’m a Woman?

Aside from Ye Ziling and Chu Haotian who were looking for each other's weakness, Liu Qingyan, Feng Zhang, and Jiang Lichen were holding an advantage in their battles. The three of them brought out their sword aura, completely suppressing their opponent’s monarch aura.

Facing their sword aura, their opponents could only bring out 70% of their strength. This scene left Feng Kui completely dumbfounded because this wasn’t what he had imagined.

“Holy shit, what’s going on?”

“Isn’t the Suspend King Art strong? They should be able to suppress sword aura at the same level…”

“Just what did the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect experience last night to become so ferocious in just one night…”

“Sky sword intent! That person used sky sword intent!” Not only Feng Kui, but the audience was also shocked when Feng Zhang brought out his sky sword intent. This scene immediately made the entire Profound Azure Plaza burst into an uproar.

Those who could grasp the sky sword intent before reaching the Elysium Core Realm could be considered geniuses, and many people failed to grasp it in their lifetime.

“This fellow…” Qin Yang’s face was ugly because he was the second senior disciple of the Suspend King Palace, and his position was only beneath Chu Tianhao. Many people felt that he wasn’t any weaker than Ye Ziling. So Qin Yang naturally couldn’t accept that he was being forced into such a desperate strait from a nobody of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“Eleventh Stage of the Suspend King Palace—Monarch Descend!” Qin Yang roared and the sky broke apart as a figure descended from the sky and overlapped with his body.

In the split second, Qin Yang’s monarch aura began to burst and reached an unbelievable height. The entire stage also began to tremble with the changes in the sky.

“Senior Brother Qin actually reached the eleventh stage without anyone knowing! There’s no doubt that he’ll win now!” The disciples of the Suspend King Palace became excited when they saw this scene.

“Brat, your time has come to an end!” Qin Yang said coldly as his monarch aura broke through his limit, reaching the height of a lesser Elysium Core Realm expert.

But facing his monarch aura, Feng Zhang didn’t seem affected at all. Compared to Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Aura, this level of monarch aura was nothing to him. At the same time, scenes began to appear in Feng Zhang’s mind as he recalled the humiliation he suffered from Lin Yun in the Sword Saint Mountain and last night.

“You’re nothing!” Feng Zhang’s eyes flashed and the scenes disappeared from his mind. Wielding his sword, he collided with Qin Yang’s spear, which unleashed a shockwave into the surroundings. When the shockwave settled down, Feng Zhang sheathed his sword and left without turning around.

When he fully sheathed his sword, Qin Yang’s spear broke and the latter threw up a mouthful of blood. After Feng Zhang broke Qin Yang’s spear, a cut appeared on Qin Yang’s chest. His ribs and organs were sliced by Feng Zhang’s sword.

Clutching his chest, Qin Yang fell to the ground.

“Feng Zhang of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect wins!” Immediately, the judge from the Profound Azure Prefecture announced the result of the battle.

Not long after Qin Yang was defeated, two other battles finished. The members of the Suspend King Palace were weaker than Qin Yang and had only reached the tenth stage of the Suspend King Art.

“The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect wins!” The judge announced once more which sounded like clapping thunder. This meant that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had obtained three wings against the Suspend King Palace. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had already won this battle.

“Lin Yun of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect wins!” The judge’s indifferent voice sounded out once more as Lin Yun threw out a palm to defeat Feng Kui before the latter could even admit defeat. This also meant that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had four wins.

The crowd was shocked, but not as shocked as the Suspend King Palace. Qin Yang and Feng Kui were particularly dumbfounded as they were knocked off the stage. After all, they were mocking the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect just a moment ago.

“How did this happen…” Qin Yang was completely dazed as he spoke with disbelief. There was only one battle left, but Chu Haotian could clearly not maintain his composure anymore. He had revealed too many flaws to Ye Ziling.

In the beginning, Chu Tianhao wasn’t anxious because he was going to wait for the outcome of the other matches. He wanted Ye Ziling to lose her composure after seeing the result. But he never expected that he would be the one losing his composure instead.

When the judge announced the result of four to zero, beads of sweat fell from Chu Tianhao’s forehead as panic set in. Aside from him, everyone else had lost despite the perfect matchups.

“You lost your composure,” said Ye Ziling.

“Don’t be too happy about it. The Suspend King Palace hasn’t lost and there’s still the hell challenge,” said Chu Tianhao coldly.

“The hell challenge? Beat me first if you’re going to mention that,” said Ye Ziling. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Sorry, but I’ve never placed a woman like you in my eyes,” smiled Chu Tianhao coldly. It was true that he didn’t place Ye Ziling in his eyes. After all, it was a joke that she was the one supporting the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“Woman?” Ye Ziling’s eyes flashed coldly with a terrifying chill spreading out.

At this moment, Lin Yun and the other participants of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect were watching from the spectator stage. There was no doubt that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had already won, but they couldn’t help feeling nervous as Ye Ziling was facing Chu Tianhao.

Furthermore, Chu Tianhao even said that he wanted to conduct the hell challenge, which would muddy their current outcome.

“Will Senior Sister be able to defeat him?” Everyone was worried as they looked at Lin Yun. Without them knowing, Lin Yun had become their source of support.

“Chu Tianhao will lose terribly,” said Lin Yun. Others might not be sure, but Lin Yun knew well that Chu Tianhao definitely wouldn’t be Ye Ziling’s opponent if she was willing to use her bloodline’s power. Furthermore, Ye Ziling had also benefited greatly from last night. After all, not everyone had the opportunity to be tempered by sword intent.

Coincidentally, Chu Tianhao’s words had enraged Ye Ziling, so Lin Yun was sure that Chu Tianhao would lose terribly.

“Don’t believe it? You’ll know the outcome within ten moves!” Chu Tianhao said. He was determined to take on the hell challenge to turn the tables around for the Suspend King Palace, so he had to finish this battle quickly. This also caused everyone’s attention to be focused on Ye Ziling and Chu Tianhao’s crucial battle.

“I’m afraid that I’ll have to disappoint you…” Ye Ziling said as Azure Birds started to fly out of her body. But unlike the ones released by Lin Yun, Ye Ziling’s birds emitted a purple glow that made them look like crystals.

With careful examination, one would realize that the purple light looked like lightning. As Ye Ziling’s dress began to flutter, strands of purple lightning bloomed on the surface of her body. This made her look like a flawless and gorgeous fairy.

At the same time, the purple flames in her pupils had condensed into a complex flower. When the flower bloomed, Chu Tianhao’s face changed as he could feel a chill run down his spine. He could sense an extremely dangerous aura leaking out from Ye Ziling, causing fear to appear in his heart.

Ye Ziling was gorgeous, but many people neglected her beauty because of her strength. But at this moment, her beauty was unrivaled in the plaza.

“So what if I’m a woman? I, Ye Ziling, have never placed you in my eyes!” Ye Ziling said coldly. As the Radiant Snow Flower bloomed in her pupils, the Azure Birds released terrifying lightning while multiple purple snow flowers drifted down from the sky.
