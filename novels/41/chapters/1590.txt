Chapter 1591 - A Mountain Of Corpses

As a silver moon hung in the sky, all four rising stars turned around and were frightened by this commotion. They had already forced Lin Yun to a dead-end, but the sudden appearance of the young girl was bizarre.

Most importantly, the pressure from her bloodline was much stronger than the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, and the pressure was enough to suppress all four of them.

“What should we do now?” Chang Yu whispered as he held onto the Lightning Dragon Tablet.

“Wait and see! We still don’t know if this person is a friend or foe.” Jiang Tong said. Everyone else had a similar thought as him. At the very least, they couldn’t see any connection between this person and Lin Yun.

Just when everyone was feeling uncertain, a piece of flute music echoed. When the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute’s music clashed with the bone flute’s music, they clashed like blades.

“Song of the Phoenix!” Lin Yun instantly recognized the music. Lil’ Purple had once taught him the Song of the Phoenix. When the flute music echoed, the bone flute youth’s face changed, and the pressure on Lil’ Red was relieved. A ferocious aura then exploded from it.

“Move! Kill that brat!” Jiang Tong was decisive and was the first to respond, immediately charging at Lin Yun. Since this person was an enemy, they did not need to wait any longer and wanted to get rid of Lin Yun first.

“Blood Devourer Demonic Blade!”

“True Dragon Impact!”

“Lesser Heavenly Sun!”

“Heavenly Net!” The four used their saint artifacts, and their auras reached a terrifying height; they were determined to slay Lin Yun.

“Good!” Lin Yun waved his hand, and an umbrella appeared in his hand. Before the four could react, Lin Yun activated the Blue Dragon Bone and poured his dragon runes into the umbrella. Even after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, it was still taxing for him to use the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

After infusing forty thousand dragon runes into the umbrella, Lin Yun roared and opened the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. A light screen blocked all the incoming attacks when the umbrella was opened.

Regardless of the Lightning Dragon, the huge net flickering with flames and lightning, or Qin Can’s demonic blade, they all bounced back when they landed on the light screen.

“What’s going on?!” The four were shocked and couldn’t comprehend why Lin Yun would own such a treasure. It was too unbelievable that he could block their four attacks by himself. One must know that Lin Yun had already exhausted a great deal of his dragon origin.

“Glory Saint Artifact!” Chang Yu exclaimed with surprise.

“Pretty good eyesight you have there. But it has come to an end now.” Lin Yun smiled because he sensed a restriction in the umbrella preventing him from further activating it. This was not the full power of the umbrella. This umbrella might be able to summon true dragons or even the Azure Dragon Constellation.

After closing the umbrella, Lin Yun leaped and landed before Chang Yu. Before the latter could respond, Lin Yun raised the umbrella and swung it down.

Although Chang Yu managed to block Lin Yun’s attack in time with the stone tablet, the shockwave still made him throw out a mouthful of blood, and his face became pale.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The umbrella was like a mountain in his hand as he swung the umbrella down. After swinging the umbrella down three times, the stone tablet was destroyed, and a remnant dragon soul flew out from the tablet.

“Keep!” Lil’ Red took a deep breath, activating the Devour Saint Rune, and devoured the dragon's soul. When Lil’ Red devoured the dragon soul, its dracoape aura exploded and it let out a ferocious roar.

Simultaneously, the bone flute blew apart under Lil’ Purple’s music and the bone flute youth threw out a mouthful of blood. Seeing this, Lil’ Red let out a ferocious roar and swung its staff down, “Die!”

“No! No! No! Jiang Tong, save me!” The bone flute youth’s face became pale, facing the dracoape.

Seeing this, Jiang Tong gritted his teeth and stomped his foot on the pond’s surface, wanting to save his companion. But how could Lin Yun possibly let him save that bone flute youth? He appeared above Jiang Tong with a few flashes and roared, “Come down!”

As the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella radiated brightly, the forty thousand dragon runes manifested into an azure dragon that was descending from the sky. Jiang Tong was forced to take Lin Yun’s attack head-on, but the power from the umbrella was too terrifying.

Colliding head-on, Jiang Tong threw out a mouthful of blood as he fell back into the pond, creating a huge splash.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff radiated with a black and golden light that manifested into a gigantic dracoape silhouette in the sky. That dracoape was also wielding a staff that was swung down, instantly killing that bone flute youth. This scene was bloody. Someone who was fine a moment ago had now been turned into minced meat.

After using the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella at full power three times, Lin Yun was exhausted and was slightly gasped for his breath, while his forehead was overed in sweat. When he looked at the surroundings from the corner of his eyes, he discovered that Chang Yu had already fled once his stone tablet shattered.

Qin Can and Yan Jiao weren’t too far away, but Lil’ Purple’s music held them back. When the silver moon descended as the music reached its climax, Jiang Tong, Yan Jiao, and Qin Can, who couldn’t flee in time, were forced down on their knees from the music, making their faces ugly.

When Lil’ Purple descended, a phoenix tree of a thousand feet rose behind her, where a silver ice phoenix was resting on the tree. Shortly after, all the birds in the air bowed in the direction of the silver ice phoenix. These were all phenomena.

It was similar to when Lin Yun played the Song of the Phoenix, but the only difference was that Lil’ Purple played the music with a saint tune, while Lin Yun only used a noble tune. When Lil’ Purple’s feet landed on the pond’s surface, Jiang Tong, Yan Jiao, and Qin Can exploded.

The so-called “Demonic Ranking’s Rising Geniuses” were nothing before the Song of the Phoenix, and this scene left Lin Yun dumbfounded. Was this Lil’ Purple’s strength after refining sixty thousand kilograms? Wasn’t this a little too unbelievable?

Although she had the help of the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, it still made Lin Yun’s scalp tingle. Lil’ Purple’s hair was silver as she wielded the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute. In addition to her flawless features, it made her look even more ethereal.

He was still in danger a moment ago, but Lil’ Purple easily resolved the three geniuses when she made a move. He could only say that he had underestimated her strength. Or rather, Lil’ Purple had recovered much of her power when the phoenix tree grew.

When Lil’ Red returned to its cat form, it sobbed while running towards Lil’ Purple. It thought that Lil’ Purple was furious and it wouldn’t be able to see her again. This was why Lil’ Red was so emotional upon seeing Lil’ Purple again.

“Stop crying. I never said I’d leave.” Lil’ Purple smiled as she hugged Lil’ Red and rubbed its head. Tossing the Divine Indigo Bamboo Jade Flute back to Lin Yun, Lil’ Purple walked over with a smile, “Here, you can have it back.”

“You’re not angry anymore?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph. I was never angry. You deserve it if you’re killed, and it has nothing to do with me.” Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes. “I’m only here because I’m worried about Lil’ Red.”

Lin Yun was left speechless when he heard that.

“Where’s the Heavenly Profound Tortoise?” Lil’ Purple asked.

Lin Yun smiled because he knew that Lil’ Purple was softhearted.

“I nearly forgot about it. I’ll call it out.” Lin Yun turned to the pond and yelled, “Brother Tortoise, the four demonic cultivators are dealt with. You can come out now!”

But the pond was quiet, and the Heavenly Profound Tortoise had no intention of responding to Lin Yun, putting Lin Yun in an awkward position.

“What’s going on?” Lil’ Purple asked.

Seeing this, Lin Yun told Lil’ Purple what happened when he tried to join forces with the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, but the latter fled, instead.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Lil’ Purple immediately became furious, “You scumbag. You’ve always been smart, so why did you let a little tortoise fool you? You’re too stupid!”

Lin Yun was silent because he couldn’t refute those words. If Lil’ Purple didn’t show up, he might’ve been in trouble, even after using the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

The Heavenly Profound Tortoise was too disloyal, completely ruining Lin Yun’s plan, and today was a lesson for him. He knew he had to be careful when interacting with others; demonic beasts were included in that, as of today.

“Where are you injured?” Lil’ Purple’s heart became soft after seeing the dejected Lin Yun.

“Well, at least it’s not lethal.” Lin Yun shook his head because he didn’t suffer any severe injuries. He had only exhausted a great deal of his dragon origin. As for those light injuries, he could recover by relying on the Azure Dragon Saint Physique and Blue Dragon Bone.

“I’ll force it out.” Lin Yun said. The Heavenly Profound Tortoise was probably afraid and thought that Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to deal with the four Demonic Ranking’s rising stars. So it was determined to deny his help.

But Lin Yun couldn’t accept his reputation being ruined at the hands of the Heavenly Profound Tortoise. He had never suffered such a heavy loss before, and the Heavenly Profound Tortoise had to hand over its Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood, regardless of whether it was willing.

After fighting with the Demonic Ranking’s rising stars, Lin Yun felt the need to make a breakthrough soon because the difference between the two stages in their cultivations made him suffer terribly. In the Ancient Barren Battlefield, he would have to face fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses. At that time, wouldn’t that mean that he wouldn’t have any ability to retaliate?

“No! No! No! Don’t come any closer!” But just when Lin Yun was about to make a move, Chang Yu suddenly returned while yelling. He kept retreating as if it had seen a terrifying existence.

When Chang Yu retreated to the edge of the Cold Pond, he went down on his knees and kowtowed, “Senior, I’m in the wrong. So please, spare my life!”

It didn’t take long for his forehead to be covered in blood. This instantly made Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple anxious as they nervously looked at the woods.
