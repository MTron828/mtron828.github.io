Chapter 1759 – Flower Only Blooms For A Tree

Mei Zihua violently coughed on Dual Moon Lake after the strings on his zither snapped, and the blood he threw out was splashed on the zither. But this added a wisp of gentleness on his dashing face.

Clutching his chest, Mei Zihua unwillingly looked at Lin Yun before placing his hand on the zither. Mei Zihua didn’t want to give up, but Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t give him a chance.

As sonic booms echoed, Lin Yun stepped forth with a golden crow appearing behind him. He then turned into a streak of light, and the erhu bow in his hand hit the back of Mei Zihua’s hand. After he knocked Mei Zihua’s hand away, Lin Yun took a deep breath and said, “You lost.”

The surroundings fell into silence when a breeze blew, with everyone’s gazes becoming grave when they looked at Lin Yun. Although Lin Yun said this in a calm tone, they could sense a cold, killing intent being emitted from him. That was his killing intent after bearing it for a long time.

Everyone knew that Lin Yun was genuinely furious this time. Strictly speaking, Mei Zihua was defeated long ago, but because of his shamelessness, he fought Lin Yun again with his nine maids. But everyone knew well that if Mei Zihua still dared to make a move, it wouldn’t end well for him today because the outcome had been decided.

When everyone looked at the pale-faced Mei Zihua, they couldn’t help sighing because this was a descendant of the Mei Clan, one of the Ten Musical Clans. But he lost to a nobody today, and if the news of this spreads out, it would definitely have a massive impact on Mei Zihua’s fame.

In particular, Mei Zihua was arrogant since his arrival, and his defeat in Lin Yun’s hands would only makes him look more embarrassing.

Many people exchanged a gaze, and they all wore awkward expressions. Those who ridiculed Lin Yun earlier were dumbfounded, and their facial expressions were ugly.

Under the countless gazes, the stalemate on Dual Moon Lake lasted for a moment. Anyone could tell that this strike from Lin Yun was painful, and Mei Zihua was furious. But Lin Yun was calm, and his murderous aura hadn’t weakened at all.

The bow held in his hand gave off a cold gleam like a sword. In the end, Mei Zihua shook his head and smiled, “You’re really impatient. I didn’t say that you didn’t win, did I?”

“Thanks for the battle.” Lin Yun withdrew the bow, and the murderous aura he gave off gradually faded. A smile also appeared on his face at the same time.

But Mei Zihua suddenly said, “You’re in such a hurry to take my nine maids? I’m someone who keeps my promise, and my nine maids are yours now. Haha.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitched when he heard that. His face was stiff while looking at Mei Zihua, and he began considering if he should stab him with the bow.

“Young Master, don’t abandon us!” The nine maids instantly became anxious upon hearing that they would be given to Lin Yun.

“I’m not interested. You can keep them for yourself.” Lin Yun said.

Mei Zihua wasn’t too bothered, and pointed at the bow in Lin Yun’s hand. He asked, “What’s that?”

“Bowstring.” Lin Yun replied.

“Can you let me give it a try?” Mei Zihua wasn’t ashamed to ask, and reached out for the bowstring, which stunned Lin Yun.

“Don’t be so stingy.” Mei Zihua exerted a bit more force. Lin Yun raised his head to briefly look at Mei Zihua before handing the erhu over. This scene left everyone stunned, and their jaws nearly fell to the ground.

Mei Zihua gave it a few tries but could only produce a creaking sound. This made him lightly furrow his brows before handing it back to Lin Yun. He said, “It’s pretty hard to play. Teach me how to play it when you have the time.”

On the boat, the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master looked at his son, Jiang Yingtian, and nodded his head.

When Jiang Yingtian appeared on the Dual Moon Lake, he smiled, “Young Master Mei’s injuries are pretty serious, and we don’t have a good doctor in the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion. So Young Master Mei should find a way to heal your injuries quickly.”

He was naturally bullshitting; anyone could tell he was trying to chase Mei Zihua away.

“There’s no need to hurry.” Mei Zihua said indifferently. “Aren’t the top ten on the Nirvana Banquet going to play before the Three-Lives Tree? Young Pavilion Master, don’t tell me I don’t have the qualification to play with the tree?”

Mei Zihua’s shamelessness made Jiang Yingtian’s lip twitch. He didn’t know where Mei Zihua got the face to stay when he lost ten against one. They would’ve left a long time ago if it was someone else.

“Give him a spot. He qualifies.” Lin Yun said.

Hearing that, Jiang Yingtian glanced at Lin Yun in surprise. But he then looked at Mei Zihua with an unfriendly expression. He said, “Since Brother Lin already said the word, I’ll give him a spot.”

Jiang Yingtian then turned to look at Lin Yun, tentatively asking if he wanted to be the first to play before the Three-Lives Tree.

“I’ll treat my injuries first. Let Young Master Mei go first, if he’s willing.” Lin Yun said.

“I’ll also treat my injuries first.” Mei Zihua smiled. He first swallowed a pellet before giving one each to his nine maids. Just like that, the ten of them sat on Dual Moon Lake to refine the pellets they had just taken.

Yue Weiwei and others rushed over, with Mu Xueling retrieving a jade bottle and handing a pellet to Lin Yun. While they treated their injuries, Jiang Yingtian arranged for Liu Ruochen, Ye Chen, Qin Hao, Zhang Ying, Chen Jun, and others to play before the Three-Lives Tree.

Those people were looking forward to this opportunity, and those by the lakeside were also curious. Liu Ruochen was the first to stand out. He played a song to the Three-Lives Tree and was soon enveloped in a faint holy radiance.

The radiance was from the Three-Lives Tree, and powerful mental energy swept out from Liu Ruochen. When he was done, the mental energy within his profound palace was increased by thirty percent. But when he raised his head, there was no response from the Three-Lives Tree. No flowers were blooming, not to mention a Three-Lives Fruit.

Although Liu Ruochen had expected this scene, he couldn’t help feeling somewhat disappointed by the result. After him, several people came forth and performed before the Three-Lives Tree. Their music was beautiful and even created various phenomena.

But all of them failed without exception, and they could not impress the Three-Lives Tree. Even someone as strong as Yan Tianchen only allowed the Three-Lives Tree to release a phenomenon.

“The Three-Lives Tree is a little difficult to deal with.” Lin Yun said, opening his eyes. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Are your injuries fine now?” Yue Weiwei happily said.

Nodding his head, Lin Yun turned to look at Mei Zihua, who slowly opened his eyes with his nine maids.

“Mei Zihua’s maids are pretty good-looking.” Yue Weiwei smiled with her eyes squinted.

When Yue Weiwei said that, Lin Yun could feel a chill running down his spine. He quickly said, “But they’re nothing compared to you.”

“That’s for sure.” Yue Weiwei smiled. She then continued, “But they’re rare beauties. Since he lost, he will surely fulfill his bet with you.”

As Lin Yun slowly got up, he looked at Yue Weiwei and asked, “Do you know what I thought of when I was covered in the snow earlier?”

“What?” Yue Weiwei asked curiously.

Looking forward, Lin Yun deeply said, “That’s no ordinary snow. It contains the power of saint runes, and Mei Zihua engraved saint runes on it with his melody. It was cold, and my consciousness was already starting to fade. I last felt so cold when we jumped down the Yin Wind Stream back in the Profound Amber Realm.”

“I was heavily injured then, and you used your martial soul to treat me…” Yue Weiwei’s face changed, and she couldn’t help grabbing onto Lin Yun’s hand. She said, “That fellow is too bad, and you’re too kind to him.”

Glancing at Mei Zihua, Lin Yun said, “Forget it. I can’t see through him. He has the same name as an old acquaintance of mine.”

“Oh, let’s forgive him, then.” Yue Weiwei replied.

Mei Zihua came over with his nine maids while they were talking, instantly making Yue Weiwei nervous.

“Brother Lin, why don’t we make another bet?” Mei Zihua smiled.

“Don’t keep betting with him. Let me bet with you.” Yue Weiwei said, blinking her eyes.

“What if you lose, then?” Mei Zihua smiled.

Sneaking a peek at Lin Yun, Yue Weiwei said, “Don’t you like to give people away? Why don’t I give you someone if I lose? I’ll give my senior brother to you.”

Yan Tianchen’s face became ugly when he heard that. But if the Profound Fairy really wanted to give him away, he could do nothing about it.

“Sure, but I’ll have to change to someone else. I’m more interested in Lin Xiao. Why don’t you give him to me if you lose?” Mei Zihua smiled.

“No way!” Yue Weiwei glared at him.

With a smile, Mei Zihua looked at Lin Yun and asked, “Do you know why these people can’t make the Three-Lives Flower bloom?”

He successfully captured Yue Weiwei and Yan Tianchen’s attention when he said that. Even Mu Xueling couldn’t help looking at Mei Zihua, surprised.

Not knowing what he was planning, Lin Yun replied, “Go on.”

“You sure you want to know about it?” Mei Zihua smiled.

Seeing that Lin Yun was in a tough position, Yue Weiwei smiled, “Why will you tell someone about it if you know? Isn’t it better for you to make the Three-Lives Tree bear fruit?”

“It’s useless even if I know about it because I can’t do it.” Mei Zihua smiled. Seeing their perplexity, he continued, “This isn’t about music dao but something else.”

“Since you can’t do it, why do you want a spot?” Yan Tianchen frowned.

“I’m asking this for my maids. They can play together and take up a spot.” Mei Zihua smiled.

“Go on then, if you know.” Yue Weiwei replied. “I can promise you anything you want.”

She naturally wanted Lin Yun to make the Three-Lives Tree bear fruit so that he could have another one.

“I do know something about it. Everyone from the Ten Musical Clans know some secrets, secrets that even the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion doesn’t know.” Mei Zihua said. He requested, “I want to know how to play the spike fiddle, including the three songs you played previously.”

“I don’t mind, but you must apologize to my senior brother before that.” Lin Yun replied.

But before Yan Tianchen could speak, Mei Zihua smiled, “He doesn’t need it. He stood out for you, and he’s fully convinced of his loss since he’s weaker than me.”

Yan Tianchen was surprised, looking at Mei Zihua, and he said, “That’s right. Junior Brother, you can just go with the deal.”

With that, Lin Yun no longer hesitated and nodded in agreement.

Seeing Lin Yun nodding, Mei Zihua smiled, “It’s a deal, then. The secret is simple. A flower only blooms for a tree.”

Yue Weiwei, Yan Tianchen, Lin Yun, and even Mu Xueling were stunned when they heard that. Meanwhile, Mei Zihua smiled before retreating with his nine maids.

“A flower only blooms for a tree…” Lin Yun pondered over what Mei Zihua said. When he looked at Yue Weiwei, she looked over at him. They suddenly felt like they caught onto something, but they soon lost it.

Right then, Zhang Ying of the Divine Dao Sect was done with his performance, but there was still no reaction from the Three-Lives Tree.

“Brother Lin, come on!” Jiang Yingtian looked over and gave Lin Yun an invitation. When he said that, the gazes of everyone in the surroundings were focused on him. Everyone was pretty curious if Lin Yun could make the Three-Lives Tree that hadn’t bloomed for the past eight centuries bloom.
