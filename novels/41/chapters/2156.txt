Chapter 2157 - Gu Xiyan!

He'll let me have three swords first? Lin Yun’s expression became weird before a smile rose on the corner of his lips.

“What’s the matter? You don’t dare?” Gu Xinyu squinted with a smile as he continued to provoke Lin Yun.

Taking a step forth, Lin Yun smiled, “That’s not it. It’s just that it has been a long time since someone made such an outrageous request.”

“Ye Qingtian, be careful. There’s something weird about him!” Situ Yan said while being heavily injured.

Lin Yun calmly said, “He’s only difficult to deal with because he relies on external objects. Don’t worry about it. There’s no good outcome to those who dare to be so arrogant before me!”

Situ Yan opened his mouth, but he felt that something wasn’t right. No matter how he looked at it, Ye Qingtian was more arrogant in his eyes.

“Is Ye Qingtian finally going to make a move?”

“Senior Brother Ye is invincible! I have never seen him lose before in terms of arrogance!”

“Gu Xinyu definitely kicked the iron plate this time. As long as Senior Brother Ye snakes a move, Gu Xinyu definitely wouldn’t have a good outcome."

Who was Ye Qingtian? He was someone who jumped around the Nine Dragon Mountains while relying on his sword, supporting two people onto the thrones.

Strictly speaking, Ye Qingtian had also contributed greatly to the fact that the Dao Yang Holy Son could become the Azure Dragon Lord. He might not have a divine dragon lord’s position, but everyone knew that Ye Qingtian was an underdog.

Gu Xinyu was arrogant, but he was nothing before Ye Qingtian. Then again, the other holy lands weren't optimistic. After all, even Situ Yan was terribly defeated, and Gu Xinyu definitely wasn’t that easy to deal with.

But speaking of which, Gu Xinyu was too weak in terms of arrogance in front of Ye Qingtian. The fact that Ye Qingtian could put two women and a man on the throne was enough to prove his arrogance. Even if Ye Qingtian didn’t have the title of a divine dragon lord, his fame wasn’t weaker than anyone on the Dragon’s Heads, and he was more dazzling instead.

But no one was confident about this battle, and many cultivators wore grave expressions.

Gu Xinyu’s ears were sharp, and he naturally heard the statements from the surrounding Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples. He was as arrogant as before, and smiled, “There are really some people who think that you can win. Make your move, then. I’ve already said that I’ll let you have three swords. I won’t retaliate until you use your full strength.”

“As you wish.” Lin Yun’s gaze became sharp as he drew his sword. His sword was pointed to the sky as the sea of sword intent in his brows began to ignite with the dual sword stars blazing. In the next second, a dazzling golden sword radiance shone from him that pierced through the sky like a pillar, shattering the thirty-six layers of heaven.

In the next second, Lin Yun released all his sword intent without any reservation. As a sun and a moon hovered above him, the entire Dragon Mountain began to tremble under his sword aura.

This made Gu Xinyu’s face change as he became shocked to discover that under the massive sword aura, his Quasi-Saint’s aura showed signs of being suppressed. But that wasn’t all. A loud sword vibration rang out from Lin Yun’s body, echoing throughout the Dragon Mountain as multiple galaxies swept out from his body.

In the next second, over a hundred galaxies reaching a few hundred feet appeared around the sun and moon, releasing a dazzling radiance. All the swordsmen within a few hundred miles in radius were shocked to discover that their swords began to tremble beyond their control.

“What a powerful sword intent!”

“What is he trying to do?” Many swordsmen were shocked. Could it be that Ye Qingtian held his strength back in his previous fights?

“Gu Xinyu, there’s something weird about this brat. Don’t play with him anymore,” Tian Gu said with a cautious expression.

Although Lin Yun’s sword aura didn’t lock onto him, he could still sense how terrifying Lin Yun’s sword intent was. So Tian Gu wanted Gu Xinyu to take back what he said earlier.

Gu Xinyu’s heart was throbbing as his throat rumbled, but he still held his front and said, “I won’t make a move within three swords.”

But that wasn’t all. A dragon’s roar echoed from within Lin Yun's body. As Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Heart was released, a silver radiance swept out as he thrusted his sword.

This made Gu Xinyu’s face drastically change before he released his saint aura, enveloping himself with a crimson energy. When the Flower Burial Sword landed on the crimson energy, the energy barrier shattered, and the sword fell onto Gu Xinyu.

The crimson energy that Gu Xinyu used to protect himself exploded. Shortly after, the jade pendant on his chest shone brightly with a powerful pressure released. In the next moment, the jade pendant released a layer of blood mist that enveloped Gu Xinyu.

At this moment, everyone exclaimed upon realizing the secret to his physique. They now knew how Gu Xinyu managed to withstand the attack from the ten overlapping sacred flames. It turned out that Gu Xinyu relied on this Blood Moon Pendant, which was at least a Three-Star Secret Treasure.

But it was futile. Gu Xinyu might possess a secret treasure, but Lin Yun had the Flower Burial Sword. As the dual sword stars began to shine, the Flower Burial Sword began to radiate brightly. The sword had its own pride, and it wouldn’t let Lin Yun down.

When Lin Yun thrusted his sword, the Flower Burial Sword pierced through the crimson mist and left a hole on Gu Xinyu’s body with his blood flowing out from his wound. At this moment, Gu Xinyu had suffered heavy injuries.

After Gu Xinyu flew out, he rolled on the ground and wiped the blood off his lips. He gritted his teeth and said, “One sword!”

Gu Xinyu tried his best to get back up and maintain his composure. But he soon couldn’t carry on his act when he saw Lin Yun grabbing onto his sword with two hands with all the galaxies combined together, compressing into a sword ray reaching over a hundred feet.

When Lin Yun circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, the sword ray he unleashed even caused space to tremble.

This time, Gu Xinyu could feel that his life was being threatened, and he would be split into two if he took this attack head-on.

“Fuck!” Gu Xinyu cursed and could no longer carry on his pretence as he retreated. But it was already too late for him to dodge this attack. The sword ray had already arrived.

As the sword ray brushed past Gu Xinyu, the latter was sent flying away with a horrifying wound left on his body. The wound was so deep that it revealed his bones.

Lin Yun didn’t give him the opportunity to catch his breath as he tapped his foot on the ground, dashing out like an azure dragon with the gathered hundred galaxies spreading out like scattered petals, shining brightly.

In the next second, the sound of flowing rivers could be heard as Lin Yun caught up to Gu Xinyu, swinging his sword again. The flowing water sounded endless, and his sword felt as though it had traveled through time. It looked as though the sword ray was unleashed by someone standing by the riverside thousands of years ago.

When that sword ray traveled through time and overlapped with Lin Yun, a sword ray that seemed to have been frozen in time shone on Lin Yun’s face.

Gu Xinyu let out a scream with his body riddled with holes, before he rolled off of the Dragon Mountain like a ball.

Lin Yun hovered in the air and sheathed his sword with beads of sweat falling down his forehead. His body gently swayed like a vibrating sword.

Outside the Dragon Mountain, cultivators from the various holy lands raised their heads and were shocked by Lin Yun’s performance.

“Ye Qingtian is the prodigy swordsman of my Heavenly Dao Sect!’ After a brief shock, the Thousand Plume Great Saint came to his senses first and began to laugh heartily.

“Senior Brother Ye is invincible!”

“The Holy Maiden Killer is invincible!”

“To be arrogant in front of Senior Brother Ye, isn’t he courting death?”

“Hahaha!” The Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples became excited when they came to their senses. Ye Qingtian’s performance was too strong, and Gu Xinyu even said that he would let Ye Qingtian have three swords first, only to have his defenses shattered after only one sword. As a result, Gu Xinyu couldn’t even resist even when he wanted to.

Three swords later, the arrogant Gu Xinyu, who claimed that there was nothing impressive about the champions of the Heavenly Path, was lying on the ground like a dog and couldn’t get back on his feet.

“That fellow…” The corner of Tian Gu’s lips twitched, and he was speechless. He already told Gu Xinyu to stop his play, but Gu Xinyu refused to heed his advice and decided to take Ye Qingtian’s sword head-on. Even when Gu Xinyu was heavily injured, he didn’t think about treating his injuries but carried on with his pretence instead, and it was already too late for him to regret it.

“Ye Qingtian, do you dare to fight me?” Tian Gu squinted as he looked at Ye Qingtian and issued his challenge. Ye Qingtian had just executed three swords earlier, and each sword would greatly exhaust his strength. So this was the perfect opportunity for him to take down Ye Qingtian. After all, there was no question that Ye Qingtian would become a formidable foe once he recovers from his exhaustion.

“Tian Gu, I’ll be your opponent.” A hearty voice came right at this moment as Gu Xiyan stood up from his throne.

“Ye Qingtian, you don’t mind letting me have him, right?” Gu Xiyan appeared before Lin Yun with a flash.

“You can carry on watching,” Lin Yun said.

“Flower Burial isn’t here, and a representative from the Heavenly Path has to stand out. Otherwise, Champions of the Heavenly Paths like us would become laughingstocks if you stole all the limelight,” Gu Xiyan said. He actually wanted to make a move earlier, but Ye Qingtian was one step ahead. He initially planned on making a move after Ye Qingtian was defeated, but he didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to make Gu Xinyu a laughingstock with three swords.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned when he heard that. He didn’t expect Gu Xiyan to have such pride, but he didn’t force himself to continue. He smiled as he retreated, “Go ahead.”

Ji Zixi’s eyes were shining brightly as she smiled, “Ye Qingtian, do you want to pay my Divine Phoenix Mountain a visit after the Blue Dragon Record?”

“What are you planning to do? He’s the genius of my Heavenly Dao Sect,” Bai Shuying said warily.

“You should come and visit. There are many holy maidens on the Divine Phoenix Mountain. Not to mention you’re also not a holy son of the Heavenly Dao Sect,” Ji Zixi smiled cunningly.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Isn’t the pearl of the Divine Phoenix Mountain right in front of us? Why make a trip to the DIvine Phoenix Mountain?” Xin Yan smiled.

Ji Zixi was furious as she looked at Xin Yan and Bai Shuying. The two weren’t pushovers, and instantly saw through her intentions of trying to poach Ye Qingtian.

“I’ll pay the Divine Phoenix Mountain a visit when I’m free,” Lin Yun said with a smile.

“That’s a promise, then!” Ji Zixi rejoiced as she reached out to give Lin Yun a high-five.

But the moment Lin Yun gave her a high-five, he immediately felt three murderous intents falling onto him. Aside from Bai Shuying and Xin Yan, there was another murderous intent that came from outside the Dragon Mountain.

“You’re not allowed to go back on your words!” Ji Zixi said excitedly.

Lin Yun smiled awkwardly and could only nod his head stiffly. It was fortunate that everyone else on Dragon Mountain didn’t notice it as their attention was on Gu Xiyan and Tian Gu.

During the Blue Dragon Record, all the champions of the Heavenly Paths were shining brightly, exhibiting extraordinary strength. But for some reason, they were all suppressed.

There was no doubt that Mu Qianjue, He Xuanjing, and Situ Yan were strong, but they no longer had the invincible demeanor they had before. This was why Gu Xiyan stood out. He wanted to prove to everyone else that the champions of the Heavenly Paths were invincible even if Flower Burial wasn’t around. Geniuses from lower realms like them weren’t any weaker than the Kunlun Realm’s geniuses, and his fighting spirits boiled.
