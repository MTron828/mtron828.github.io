Chapter 1705 – Lin Yun (1)

The terrifying crimson dragon rose to the sky before it dove down. The crimson dragon was enveloped in demonic light, and the flute music from Xu Dongfei manifested into crimson smoke that poured into the massive dragon.

As the crimson dragon let out a roar, it dove towards Lin Yun at a terrifying speed, and a vast shadow enveloped half the Cloud Fragrance Hall. Seated on the stone platform, Lin Yun was right in the shadow's center.

When a powerful dragon aura swept out, the flute music pushed the crimson dragon’s rage to the limit. Before it descended, the immense pressure also caused cracks to spread on the ground, and the entire Cloud Fragrance Mountain lightly shook.

This made the faces of Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion and Exquisite Court’s disciples change as they quickly retreated. The commotion that was being caused by the crimson dragon was too great.

“That fellow is actually playing the Crimson Dragon Scripture…” Luo Shuyi said. The Crimson Dragon Scripture was a sinister score and also a forbidden score. Anyone who wanted to play it successfully would have to pay a great price.

With Xu Dongfei’s current cultivation, it was naturally impossible for him to play the complete Crimson Dragon Scripture, but just a small portion was enough to turn the tables around. Even Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan, initially confident in Lin Yun, couldn’t help becoming nervous when they saw this scene.

“The ancient sinister score is indeed impressive.” Lin Yun remained seated and raised his head to look at the crimson dragon that was swiftly approaching. But he was still wearing a smile on his face, and he didn’t have much panic in his pupils.

Taking a deep breath, the second saint rune in his profound palace shone, and he pushed the Azure Dragon Saint Physique to the limit. As countless dragon runes poured into the Thunderstorm Zither, golden light shone from his body. His fingers also shone brightly, and a pure phoenix aura suddenly swept out from his body—the aura was filled with an ancient presence and aloofness.

“The Divine Phoenix Touch, Sun and Moon, and the Thunderstorm Zither…I wonder how powerful this will become…” Lin Yun smiled, and his ten fingers began to dance the next moment.

As the massive sun above his head began to melt, it formed into a dazzling golden crow that circled in the sky. Golden lights were gushing from its wings, and it dyed the entire sky in gold, spanning a hundred miles and made him look like an immortal.

Simultaneously, silver light gushed out from his fingers, and a silver lake was swiftly formed on the ground of the Cloud Fragrance Hall. The lake was massive, and it was silver, looking like a mirror. At the lake's depths, there was a silver phoenix that looked like a moon.

Regardless of Lin Yun’s martial techniques or music scores, he mixed his own comprehension into them and wouldn’t follow what the creator left behind. This was the same for Sun and Moon. He had infused his understanding of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist into it, and the fusion was perfect. A golden crow manifested the sky, and a silver phoenix manifested the earth. As the Thunderstorm Zither played, it reached a height that would even make Lil’ Purple exclaim.

A cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils as the sun and moon changed. He then let out a roar, and a dazzling radiance shone from his ten fingers.

The Yin-Yang symbol continued to revolve within the Thunderstorm Zither before an ancient dragon roar echoed from it. As a terrifying power swept out along Lin Yun’s fingers, the sun and moon began to fuse. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

It didn’t take long for the sun and moon to fuse into a thousand-foot long sword. It was a divine sword with the sun and moon engraved on it. Covered in traces of aging, a horrifying sword intent swept out from the divine sword.

As the divine sword soared into the sky under everyone’s gazes, it turned into a streak of light and flew towards the crimson dragon. Before they even clashed, two terrifying auras had already swept out from the crimson dragon and divine sword, clashing together. The surrounding space began to tremble and distort when the two immense auras collided.

When Lin Yun raised his head, a cold light flashed through his pupils, and the golden human within his sword ocean emitted a dazzling radiance. Lin Yun’s pinnacle of Firmament Sword Intent then empowered the divine sword.

“Slash!” Lin Yun roared. As his hair fluttered, he played an overlapping note with his right hand. The entire crimson dragon’s head was snapped off as blood splashed out.

As the crimson ocean crumbled, Xu Dongfei lowered his flute and took ten steps back. Whenever he stepped back, he would throw out a mouthful of blood. After taking ten steps back, he was staggering and was struggling to remain on his feet.

“You lost.” Lin Yun raised his head and looked at the latter with a smile.

Three Exquisite Court disciples came forth to support Xu Dongfei. At this moment, Xu Dongfei’s facial expression was sinister as he looked at Lin Yun and roared, “I’ve not lost yet! The reason why you can win against me is all because of that ancient zither. That must be an ancient saint zither!”

Before Lin Yun could even respond, the Exquisite Court elders stood up, roaring, “The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion can’t beat our disciples, so they have to resort to this? Aren’t you guys afraid of becoming a laughingstock in the world? Or are you implying that we don’t have any ancient artifacts?”

Before the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s party could recover from their shock, they flew into a rage when they heard what the Exquisite Court’s elders said. They were simply too shameless to blame the quality of musical instruments when they lost.

After all, Lan Hongyan had used poison earlier to win. Although the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s party was furious, they didn’t say anything because a loss was a loss.

Xu Dongfei even resorted to a forbidden score, and yet he had the cheek to blame Lin Yun for using a better musical instrument when he lost. Was everyone from the Exquisite Court sore losers?

Seeing this, Lin Yun squinted his eyes and turned to Lin Wan with a smile, “Lady Lin, do you mind letting me borrow your lute?”

Lin Wan was first shocked before she smiled, “You can go ahead and use it, if you want. There’s no need for you to be so polite.”

She didn’t even hesitate to throw her musical instrument over. She was happy that Lin Yun would use her lute. So how would she refuse?

Waving his hand and taking the lute, Lin Yun gave it a few tries before he turned to look at the Exquisite Court’s party. “I don’t mind playing another round if you guys are such sore losers. All your disciples can come and challenge me at once. This way, you guys won’t have any excuses then, right?”

Lin Yun’s laughter left Xu Dongfei and others dumbfounded because Lin Yun was a little too arrogant.

“What’s the matter? You guys don’t even dare to come at me together?” Lin Yun mocked.

“Go! Kill him!” Xu Dongfei gritted his teeth.

The Exquisite Court’s disciples couldn’t stand Lin Yun’s arrogance, not to mention that he had definitely exhausted himself from the previous fight. Yet, he still dared to be so arrogant? Did he really think that the Exquisite Court was a pushover? Before Xu Dongfei could finish, the Exquisite Court’s disciples already took out their instruments and circulated the saint runes in their profound palaces.

“Hahaha! Come!” Lin Yun laughed. As he played the lute, the lute music wasn’t gentle but was filled with boundless ferocity in the form of a crimson light that swept throughout the surroundings. The crimson light contained boundless killing intent and raging fury, dying the entire lute’s strings red.
