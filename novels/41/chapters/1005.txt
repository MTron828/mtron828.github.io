Chapter 1006 - A Strand of Hair, A Life!

With Yu Haotian’s death, the turbulence in the Azure Dragon Palace had finally died down. Through the turbulence, Lin Yun’s name was destined to spread throughout the Heavenly Path. Even Luo Chen and the others were looking at Lin Yun enviously.

Not only did Lin Yun obtain the fortune in the Azure Dragon Palace, but he even obtained Yu Haotian’s fortune and Yu Haotian’s interspatial pouch. On top of all this, Lin Yun even got the Divine Shadow Glove. The Divine Shadow Glove was a huge reason why Luo Chen’s group lost so miserably, so they couldn’t help feeling envious.

The Divine Shadow Glove had a fragment of a soul sealed in it and the glove also possessed a high grade astral flame. So even if it was someone unfamiliar with fist techniques, they could still unleash unparalleled power.

Luo Chen’s group watched as Lin Yun counted his treasures. They were already injured and they didn’t dare to provoke Lin Yun. After all, Pei Xue had already said that Lin Yun was an extraordinary genius with Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans.

If he wanted to, Lin Yun could suppress Luo Chen’s group with just his origin energy. After all, Lin Yun was destined to shine in the Heavenly Path.

“Brother Lin, thank you for dealing with Yu Haotian. Otherwise, we would definitely suffer,” said Luo Chen. He was also rejoicing at the fact that he had befriended Lin Yun early.

“He and I had an irreconcilable feud. There’s no need to be polite with me,” smiled Lin Yun.

Seeing that Lin Yun was still as amicable as before, Luo Chen was filled with more respect for Lin Yun. “That might be the case, but it’s still undeniable that we were saved by you. What plans do you have now? There are only four to five months in the Heavenly Path and you have to make it to the end for the final battle.”

The depth of Lin Yun’s pupils blazed with flames as he said, “I’m looking forward to that battle, but I have to leave for now. I need time to digest everything. After all, there are many crouching tigers and hidden dragons.”

“Hehe, you’re realistic. You’re unlike Yu Haotian who became arrogant because of the demonic spirit.” Pei Xue smiled. “With your current strength, you might be able to reach the top ten. You’re still young, but you don’t have to worry about your ranking. You have extraordinary talent. You can pick whatever powerful sect you want.”

What Pei Xue said left Luo Chen’s group of three speechless because these were powerful sects they were talking about. Then again, they didn’t doubt Pei Xue’s words because Lin Yun did possess the strength.

But when Lin Yun heard that he could only compete for the top ten, he squinted his eyes. Was the final battle that brutal?

“What’s wrong? You don’t believe me?” Pei Xue looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile. “You’ll know when you reach the end. Let’s not mention the war realms, but there are also geniuses like that little lover of yours. Then again, you don’t have to worry since I said that you’re an extraordinary talent. Even without rankings, the powerful sects will surely compete over you.”

In Pei Xue’s view, Lin Yun was still too young. Then again, it was also his advantage because he had a lot more potential to be excavated. If he was slightly older, the powerful sects wouldn’t fight over him.

Lin Yun’s squinted eyes suddenly opened when he heard what Pei Xue said. When his gaze fell onto Pei Xue, sword intent began to surge within his pupils as a loud hum echoed in Pei Xue’s ears. Under the sword intent, the flow of her blood became slow and the rhythm of her heart beat was nearly controlled by Lin Yun. Pei Xue was the only one who could feel this.

Luo Chen’s group could sense something unusual in the atmosphere and their hearts immediately sank. Is Lin Yun going to deal with Pei Xue like Yu Haotian?

“I believe you have something to say to me,” said Lin Yun. The depths of his pupils surged with sky sword intent as he focused on Pei Xue, slowly destroying the aura around her. But he didn’t attack her because this would mean that they would fall out completely.

“You want to ask about Yue Weiwei, right? Sorry, but I can’t tell you about that. I’ll tell you if we meet again,” smiled Pei Xue. Her charm was similar to Yue Weiwei. Lin Yun was certain that Pei Xue knew Yue Weiwei.

In the end, she still left. When Lin Yun’s sword intent was about to destroy the aura around Pei Xue, purple light distorted around her and she had disappeared. The only thing left behind were faint fluctuations. When Lin Yun raised his head, Pei Xue had already gone far away.

The reason why he didn’t attack was that he didn’t know if she was a friend or enemy. Furthermore, he couldn’t guarantee that she didn’t have any trump cards. With his current eyesight, he could tell that she had a powerful seal within her body.

“Brother Luo, do you know that woman?” Lin Yun asked.

“She’s known as the ice beauty in the Vermillion Bird Region and many people have suffered in her hands. There are rumors that she’s from a war realm, but she has never acknowledged or denied it.” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because this was the first time he had heard about it.

“No one dares to provoke those from the war realms because they’re forbidden existences in the Heavenly Path. Even those from the higher realms are nothing before them. Brother Lin, you’re right not to make a move against her,” said Luo Chen with lingering fear. He was really afraid that Lin Yun would make a move against Pei Xue because this meant that the three of them would be implicated.

“Are the Ten War Realms that strong?” Lin Yun asked. He had heard from Fang Shaoyu about the war realms when he arrived at the Heavenly Path. However, they were still a mystery to him.

“Very strong,” said Luo Chen with a grave expression. “The Ten War Realms aren’t much different from the Kunlun Realm. Plus, they each have a direct passage to the Kunlun Realm. For a realm to become a war realm, they either need an ancient inheritance, a divine artifact, or a powerhouse. The inheritances in their realms aren’t any weaker than the powerful sects in the Kunlun Realm.”

With Luo Chen’s explanation, Lin Yun roughly understood the Ten War Realms’ origin.

“The Azure Dragon Region also had people from the Ten War Realms, but they seemed to be looking for something. Therefore, they left right after they arrived. It’s been half a year since I’ve seen them. The power they displayed back then wasn't inferior to you by any means,” said Luo Chen with a grave expression. He wasn’t sure, but he could sense that those geniuses were a lot stronger than Lin Yun.

The geniuses from the war realms are looking for something? Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that because Yue Weiwei also said that she was looking for something. He began to wonder if they were looking for the same thing.

“Thank you for your explanation,” responded Lin Yun.

“You’re too polite. We’ll meet again at the end of the Heavenly Path.” Luo Chen’s group cupped their hands before they left Lin Yun to digest the information he just heard.

Yue Weiwei must be in trouble because she offended someone. It looks like she was forced to run for her life. Lin Yun was certain that Yue Weiwei must’ve offended someone from the Ten War Realms. It finally made sense why she left him in the beginning. Clearly, she didn’t want to cause Lin Yun any trouble. After all, he would have easily lost his life. But even so, she came secretly back to check up on him.

“That lass…” Lin Yun frowned and his nose began to sour after he recalled how sweetly she smiled when she called him big brother. Memories began to play in Lin Yun’s mind, which made his gaze grow cold. “They better not harm you. Otherwise…”

Lin Yun didn’t care if he was up against the war realms. He had already given his promise to Yue Weiwei that he would take the lives of those who dared to touch a strand of her hair.
