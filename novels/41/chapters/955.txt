Chapter 956 - Mysterious Space

“It’s here!” Lin Yun focused on the flames blazing on the altar with excitement on his face.

He instantly attracted a lot of attention as he walked forward. At this point, everyone was aware of his achievements.

When Lin Yun got close, he could sense an invisible barrier enveloping the altar. After sensing the powerful aura in front of him, he muttered, “It’s different now…”

Suddenly, seven dazzling stars lit up as the surroundings became dark. If one looked carefully, the seven stars looked like seven bodies of the azure dragon. They could also link together to form one gigantic azure dragon.

That’s the Seven Azure Dragons Constellation! Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he could sense that the seven stars had some connection with the genuine Sevens Azure Dragon Constellation. Then, a bright star rose up and headed towards a constellation. When the star fused with the constellation, eighteen stars began to light up with life.

Shortly after, five more stars flew into the cluster. They perfected the outline of the azure dragon even more. Those five stars naturally came from the owners of the five astral spirits who threw their astral spirits in.

“Brother Lin, it’s your turn,” smiled the Gloryfire Spirit’s owner.

Lin Yun nodded his head. The Gloryfire Spirit’s owner was considered the friendliest among the five. As for the other four, they more or less had too much pride to be friendly.

Lin Yun took out the Glorysun Spirit and threw it without any hesitation. All that was left was the Glorymoon Spirit.

Discussions broke out as everyone wondered where the Glorymoon Spirit’s owner was. Even the five owners of the astral spirits started to frown. But just when they were about to lose their patience, a burst of laughter sounded out, “Relax. I’m coming.”

Laughter sounded out, but Lin Yun couldn’t see Yu Haotian anywhere. It was as if he wasn’t here. Suddenly, a star flew out and entered the last star clusters of the azure dragon.

In the next second, the azure dragon came to life. When the dragon started to coil, the stars revolved around the space surrounding the shrine.

Lin Yun’s face changed slightly because it felt like the azure dragon was occupying the entire space of the shrine. But if it really was occupying the entire space, everyone present should be dead.

“Space-time law?” Lin Yun could sense that the laws of space and time were being used. However, the realm was too high, so he couldn’t comprehend it. He could only watch the azure dragon to improve his azure dragon sword aura.

Then, a gate slowly condensed on the altar from the azure dragon bursting into flames. Soon after, the astral spirits descended and Lin Yun grabbed hold of his Glorysun Spirit. With a quick look, he saw Yu Haotian retrieving the Glorymoon Spirit.

Yu Haotian was also looking at Lin Yun with a smile before his figure gradually disappeared. When the Gloryfire Spirit’s owner looked at Yu Haotian, he smiled and said to Lin Yun, “He goes around hiding like a simple clown. He can’t be compared to you.”

But Lin Yun didn’t respond because he knew that Yu Haotian couldn’t be underestimated. If the opportunity presented itself, he would take Yu Haotian’s life. He couldn’t allow him to escape another time. Otherwise, Yu Haotian would continue to grow and threaten him.

As the gate slowly opened on the altar, an ancient aura swept out and made everyone emotional. But just as the crowds were about to charge into the gate, a boundless pressure appeared in the sky. Everyone could feel an immense pressure crashing down.

“The Azure Dragon Region’s Seven Heads!” Seven figures approached the altar, silencing the surroundings. The seven heads were declaring their might.

They’re the Azure Dragon Ranking’s Seven Heads? Lin Yun raised his head in surprise. He finally understood why they didn’t fight for the astral spirits. Based on their terrifying aura, any of the seven could have taken the astral spirits with a single word.

“The black-clothed youth is Luo Chen, chief of the Azure Dragon Region. He’s also known as the dragon head. The white-clothed youth is Jun Mengchen and the one beside him is Qin Lin…” The owner of the Gloryfire Spirit gave Lin Yun an explanation after seeing Lin Yun’s fiery gaze.

Lin Yun smiled out of gratitude. When the seven heads entered the gate, the pressuring atmosphere disappeared. This made the entire plaza boil as countless people flew into the gate.

“Lin Yun, you better not run into me!” Liu Mu glared at Lin Yun coldly before he departed.

“We’ll see what happens,” smiled Lin Yun. With a flash, Lin Yun flew into the gate. He could feel the violent spatial fluctuation as he passed through a starry sky containing a massive azure dragon.

Lin Yun could faintly sense that he was enveloped by powerful spatial energy as he flew towards the azure dragon. When his vision came back, he found himself standing in the middle of a massive and barren land. Not a single trace of life could be seen as he looked around.

This space was full of desolation and judging by the cracks in the sky, an earth-shattering battle must have taken place in the past.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Suddenly, lightning flashed through the gray sky that manifested ancient images of two people fighting. But when Lin Yun tried to get a better look, the images disappeared.

“That bolt of lightning is even more terrifying than the Heavenly Soul Realm tribulation. I should avoid flying high in the sky,” muttered Lin Yun with a grave expression.

I have to find an opportunity to make a breakthrough. Lin Yun needed to find treasures, saint pellets from ancient times, or beast cores. As long as he found something precious, he would have no problem with his second tribulation.

There were too many experts around, so he wouldn’t feel safe until he reached the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. If he fought with the other astral spirit owners or hidden experts, he wouldn’t fare well.

Without a word, Lil’ Red transformed into a horse to start traveling. Right now, Lil’ Red had the cat and horse form. The cat form could fully unleash Lil’ Red’s fighting prowess while the horse form could push its speed to the limit.

But Lin Yun had a feeling that Lil’ Red wasn’t limited to these forms. Perhaps Lil’ Red would have a surprise once its bloodline improved.
