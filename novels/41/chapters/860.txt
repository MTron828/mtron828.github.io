Chapter 861 - Battle of Fate!

Everyone on the Profound Amber Mountain were dumbfounded as they looked at the headless corpse. Perhaps the other geniuses all looked down on Lin Yun, but not the Sacred Alliance’s elders. In their view, Lin Yun had around a 50% chance of winning.

That’s why they never imagined that Zhong Xuan would be killed by Lin Yun. The unbelievable outcome had a huge impact on the elders. They knew that it wasn’t easy to beat other geniuses, let alone kill them. After all, a champion of a domain wasn’t a pushover because they had received a great fortune. But somehow, Zhong Xuan had died with his head blown up by Lin Yun.

“H-how is this possible?!” Chang Hai of the Mountain Western Domain’s Sacred Alliance was stunned. Evidently, he couldn’t accept Zhong Xuan’s outcome.

“Zhong Xuan died?” Shangguan Qinghong was also dumbfounded and his face became pale. Fear took over his heart because he realized that Lin Yun could kill him. When he thought about all of his resentment and rage, he felt embarrassed. He acted like a fool who didn’t even realize how close he was to death. Guan Lie and Zhao Yu also felt fear as cold sweat covered their backs.

“Haha. Qing Tu, it looks like the Ancient Southern Domain will really rise this time thanks to Lin Yun!” Gao Zhangtian looked over with a smile. To be able to kill Zhong Xuan, meant that Lin Yun was a lot stronger than Zhong Xuan. At the very least, he wasn’t any weaker than Fang Shaoyu.

“He’s just lucky, lucky.” Qing Tu smiled. After all, Lin Yun hadn’t obtained the quota yet so everything was still uncertain.

Hearing what Gao Zhangtian said, the other Sacred Alliance’s elders recovered from their shock and gave their congratulations. In their view, Lin Yun was destined to receive a quota. If Lin Yun couldn’t obtain the quota when he killed Zhong Xuan, then the test would be meaningless.

After all, the odds of encountering two champions in a row were low. When Mu Han and the others saw this scene, they revealed their smiles. Although they were out of the competition, Lin Yun had given them pride. They were especially happy since all of them had a good relationship with Lin Yun.

Lin Yun moved on to the next test and found a path that was even more dangerous than before. Magma flowed with lightning throughout the entire path with arrays set up by fourth grade spiritualists.

The terrifying thing was that the fourth grade spiritualists had grasped fourth grade spiritual runes. Fourth grade spiritual runes were considered high grade spiritual runes. When empowered by high grade spiritual runes, arrays, diagrams, and puppets would have an earth-shaking transformation.

Fortunately, Lin Yun was well versed in spiritual runes, so he easily made it through the arrays. He soon came to the end of the pathway and saw another bronze gate. This gate was somewhat special as it had golden patterns on it. The golden patterns consisted of spiritual runes that looked like countless birds were gathered together.

“Spiritual diagram.” Lin Yun narrowed his eyes because he recognized the golden patterns. It looked like a painting of a hundred birds soaring into the sky. Lin Yun could tell that this diagram was not offensive. Standing before the bronze gate, Lin Yun took a deep breath because this was the last fight.

Lin Yun guessed that his opponent must be inside. After all, he took a long time to get here. Since I’m already late, it’s time to see who is behind this gate!

With a sharp light flashing through Lin Yun’s eyes, he placed his hand on the spiritual diagram without any hesitation. When he opened the gate, birds flew out from the spiritual diagram as if in a ceremony for Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was on high alert as he took a step forward. He would never make the same mistake again and be careless. It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to arrive in a spacious and majestic hall. His speculation was right because there was already someone here waiting for him.

At the center of the hall stood a person with starlight shining down. But because of the brilliance, Lin Yun couldn’t take a clear look at that person’s face. When Lin Yun felt the demonic aura that the figure was giving off, he knew that it had to be the Gauze Eastern Domain’s Yan Mo!

When Yan Mo saw Lin Yun, his heart began to fluctuate because he was surprised that he would run into Lin Yun at the last stage. However, there was no change on his face as if he was confident that he could suppress anyone who came. If it was someone else, Yan Mo’s aura would make them feel uncomfortable.

Unfortunately, Yan Mo was facing Lin Yun. Lin Yun had just killed Zhong Xuan, so why would he put Yan Mo in his eyes?

“Lin Yun, it looks like we’re fated to fight. I wanted to experience your spiritual sword intent, but I wasn’t able to earlier. Now, I can finally get my wish fulfilled. I can head to the Heavenly Path without any regrets.” Yan Mo smiled. Clearly, he didn’t think much of Lin Yun.

“Are you that confident that you can obtain the quota?” Lin Yun smiled. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Of course. You’re strong, but it’s a shame that you ran into me,” said Yan Mo indifferently. At this moment, he was especially dazzling with the deep and unfathomable aura he was giving off. He was Yan Mo, the champion and god of death of the Gauze Eastern Domain. When the elders saw Lin Yun’s final opponent, all of them exploded.

“Holy shit, what’s going on? Why did he run into another champion?”

“What’s going on? Only his first stage was normal.”

“Isn’t his luck a little too bad to run into two champions?” No one could believe that Lin Yun ran into two champions.

Gao Zhangtian fell into deep thoughts before his eyes lit up and laughed, “Interesting. Back then, the Indigomoon Elysium joined hands with other domains to annihilate the Sword Sect. The Gauze Eastern Domain and Mountain Eastern Domain were heavily involved. Lin Yun killed Zhong Xuan, which in my view, means that the Mountain Eastern Domain’s fortune has come to an end. If he slays Yan Mo, he would have gotten revenge for the Sword Sect. Lin Yun must have the Sword Sect’s karma on him!”

The moment he spoke out, the surrounding forces were instantly suppressed. The Sacred Alliance had always been neutral, so they naturally knew about Sword Sect’s annihilation. When Gao Zhangtian revealed that thought, everyone fell into a deep silence. They weren’t concerned with it in the beginning, but the more they thought about it, the more afraid they became.

Why else would Lin Yun run into two champions? He was basically going through hell mode in comparison to the other geniuses.

Qing Tu’s eyes flickered with hesitation, “Is this really fate? Lin Yun shined brightly on the banquet with the Sword Sect’s Overlord Sword. Furthermore, the sect he came from was founded by the Sword Sect’s heir.”

Everyone was shocked with disbelief on their faces when they heard that. Was all this the work of fate?

“Hmph, so what if it’s fate? How can Yan Mo of my Gauze Eastern Domain be compared to a trash like Zhong Xuan from the Mountain Western Domain? It will be good enough if Lin Yun can survive this fight with Yan Mo. As for severing karma? He can only dream about it.”

“That’s right. It’s fortunate enough if he can come out alive,” said the other geniuses from the Gauze Eastern Domain.

The other domains fell silent because what the geniuses from Gauze Eastern Domain said wasn’t wrong. Yan Mo was a lot stronger than Zhong Xuan. He was even comparable to Fang Shaoyu. In the Profound Amber Realm, only he and Fang Shaoyu stood at the top of the pyramid.

Instantly, everyone from the Ancient Southern Domain became nervous. Clearly, they never expected that this battle would involve the annihilation of the Sword Sect. This was just a test, but how did it turn into a battle of fate?
