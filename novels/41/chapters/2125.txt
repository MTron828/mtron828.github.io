Chapter 2126: Ancient Vajra Monastery

That youth didn’t even know how he died.

“Everything is mere ants beneath the greater dao?” Lin Yun sneered. He preferred Ye Guhan’s saying that there was nothing too profound about greater dao. It was just an amplification, and one would die a horrible death if they were too confident about it.

Lin Yun’s Astral Sword Intent had reached the pinnacle of complete mastery, and if anyone wanted to suppress him with greater dao, it would have to be at least a sixth-grade martial intent. This was mainly because he possessed dual sword stars, and his sword intent was stronger than ordinary martial intent.

Black ants began to emerge from the black marsh. They looked insignificant, but they gave off a faint metallic luster. These were Blackfire Demonic Ants, and they lived in the marsh. They were ants that the youth was about to speak of, but these ants were the overlord of this marsh. The black ants soon devoured the youth’s corpse without any bones left.

Lin Yun watched this quietly, and these ants behaved like normal, routing through Lin Yun and crawling to the other corpses. This was because they could sense a terrifying aura coming from Lin Yun. They ran into Lin Yun multiple times but couldn’t be Lin Yun’s opponent. But Lin Yun was cautious and didn’t move against the ants because there wouldn’t be any benefits.

“There are benefits. These Blackfire Demonic Ants are still in their first state. If you can find the ant queen and tame it, these Blackfire Demonic Ants can evolve into the Heavenly Demonic Ants, capable of killing saints silently,” Lil’ Purple explained. “In ancient times, there was a way of nurturing insects, and we call them Insect Masters. They lie in solitary, but few people dare to provoke them.”

Lin Yun only took a few glances at the Blackfire Demonic Ants and lost his interest in them. He had a good harvest as he disappeared with the Flower Burial Sword at his waist.

Not only Lin Yun but everywhere in the secret realms was accompanied by brutal killings. There was no threshold for the Azure Dragon Record. The righteous and demonic forces could participate, meaning there were many people.

The righteous and demonic forces would fight among themselves indiscriminately, and the battle was chaotic. There were also conflicts between sects, and the competition would become fiercer as treasures appeared. As it involved their interest, there was no distinction between good and evil.

That was the case for Lin Yun, and he would kill those who dared to challenge him. On a mountain in the True Dragon Secret Realm was a river of blood with a surging ominous aura.

“Leave quickly! Xiao Hongfei has started a massacre!”

“What is that fellow doing in the True Dragon Secret Realm?!”

“Damn it, he’s out! We’re all dead now!” Wails sounded in the valley as everyone tried their best to flee. Those who managed to slay Quasi-Saint demonic beasts quickly left the secret realm with no intentions to further search for treasures in the secret realm. Only those who hadn’t killed a demonic beast in the Quasi-Saint Realm would try their best to run for their lives.

“Hahaha! Why are you guys hurrying to leave since you’re here?” A crimson blade ray flashed as the black-clothed Xiao Hongfei walked out, laughing. The blade ray he unleashed was terrifying, killing anyone who came in contact with it.

Xiao Hongfei was ranked sixty-eighth on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking, and no one could put up a resistance against him. On a True Dragon Secret Realm lake, countless corpses were floating on the lake as Feng Haotian, another genius on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking, was going on a killing spree.

In just a brief moment, many cultivators who were competing over a saint herb were killed by him. When Fang Haotian pushed his palm forth, it formed into a demonic claw enveloped in black flames, and no one in his path could withstand his attack. His demonic claw tore through saint aura and pierced through the hearts of his prey. His demonic claws flew around as Fang Haotian stood in the same position, killing everyone before him.

“The vitality hasn’t increased?” Fang Haotian looked at the corpses floating on the lake with doubt because there was really something strange about the True Dragon Secret Realm.

Similar massacres were taking place in the True Dragon Secret Realm. Unlike the other Divine Dragon Secret Realms, those who could come here were weaker in comparison or ruthless people on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking.

The weaker cultivators didn’t have a choice because they chose the True Dragon Secret Realm. After all, this secret realm was weaker. Many demonic cultivators in the True Dragon Secret Realm didn’t hold back after the righteous cultivators came in.

Lin Yun spent some time before he came out of the black marsh. He stood on a Buddha statue, and the far end was covered in endless yellow sand.

“There’s something weird about this place for a desert to be connected with a marsh.” Lin Yun muttered as he turned around, and the black marsh slowly disappeared.

“This isn’t an illusion, right?” Lin Yun quickly took out the innate saint fruit and heaved a sigh of relief after confirming it was real. However, the surrounding environment was unpredictable, and even the space seemed chaotic, which gave Lin Yun a headache. He didn’t have much need for treasures now and wanted to find those from the Sword Sect.

“Let’s carry on forth.” Lin Yun had no choice but to jump down the Buddha statue. Suddenly, a vortex appeared in the desert that dragged Lin Yun down. Lin Yun could easily break free, but he decided to see where the vortex would bring him after a brief pondering.

When Lin Yun’s feet landed on solid ground, he found himself in a dark corridor, with candles hanging on both sides of the wall, flickering on and off. Lin Yun reached out and pulled a candle through the air. His hand felt heavy, with a powerful aura coming from him.

“This is interesting. The candle and flames are extraordinary.” Lin Yun had extraordinary eyesight, and he could see that the candles were precious and seemed to be made of saint blood and dragon drool.

“As expected of you. You didn’t even let go of the candles,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun didn’t waste time with her because the candle might seem insignificant here, but it was extraordinary in the outside world. Along the way, Lin Yun gathered ten candles and heard noises as some people came here through a small-scale teleportation array.

It was a luxurious palace when he reached the far end of the corridor. The dome was decorated with mithril and gems, which formed into a galaxy with many stone pillars on the ground.

Lin Yun took a casual look and saw eight doors that connected this palace, and a group of Quasi-Saints was fighting in the main hall. Various saint aura and constellations bloomed when they attacked with phenomena accumulated in the main hall. He gazed through the main hall and saw three factions competing for a saint pellet enveloped in golden radiance.

The ones leading the factions were Quasi-Saints, who grasped greater dao. The Quasi-Saints followed them, unleashing countless attacks, and many corpses were lying on the ground. Anyone could tell that the three factions were serious in the fight.

This instantly made Lin Yun lose interest because the strongest here was on the same level as the Whiteclothed Venerable, and they were much weaker in comparison. Thus, he lost interest in waiting for a result and stepped forth. The moment he appeared, the three factions quickly stopped what they were doing and became cautious.

“Looks like even a fry is after the True Dragon Saint Pellet.”

“You want to take all the benefits at the very end? Dream on!”

“Kill him first!” The two parties fought for a long time and weren’t willing to let someone else benefit from their fight. Thus, they quickly made a move after seeing Lin Yun.

Lin Yun merely sneered because this was no different from a bunch of novices fighting each other. Did they really think that they were experts? But just when Lin Yun was about to make a move, a punch flew over.

The fist gave off a silver radiance that manifested into a white dragon with murderous intent sweeping out. In the path of the white dragon, those who didn’t grasp the greater dao were instantly killed, leaving the three who grasped the greater dao throwing blood on the ground. They looked at the newcomer with horror and could confirm that this person was also an expert on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking.

There were only a hundred people on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking, and they could be known as the strongest hundred people in the Kunlun Realm. Many people concealed their strengths and didn’t appear on the ranking, but those on the ranking were absolute geniuses. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Run!” Very quickly, the three turned around and gave up on the saint pellet.

As footsteps sounded, Lin Yun was the only one left with many corpses. But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered because his attention was on the paintings engraved on the pillars.

“Sure enough, there is a lot of garbage in the True Dragon Secret Realm.” Footsteps sounded out as a bald youth walked in. This person was ranked seventy-eighth on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking, a saint disciple of the Western Desert’s Ancient Vajra Monastery, an ancient Buddhist holy land.

“Mhm? There’s also someone here?” When Cao Yang wanted to retrieve the saint pellet, he noticed Lin Yun’s existence. Cao Yang was stunned when he recognized Lin Yun and smiled, “So you’re daring to compete with me for the saint pellet, the last on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking and Holy Maiden Killer, Ye Qingtian!”

“It’s me.” Lin Yun casually nodded as he continued to examine the painting. There was a True Dragon in the painting, but the dragon had different expressions on different pillars. They didn’t seem to be engraved but painted with divine runes.

“To stay around even after seeing me. It looks like you’re pretty confident in yourself. But it’s a pity that the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking is pretty accurate, and you don’t have any Holy Maiden here helping you,” Cao Yang smiled. He didn’t place Lin Yun in his eyes and looked at Lin Yun with disdain.

“Why don’t you give it a try then?” Lin Yun casually replied as he walked over to the other pillars with his eyes shining brightly. He noticed that there was something special about the pillars.

“You!” A murderous intent swept out as flames of rage blazed in Cao Yang’s eyes while he approached Lin Yun. His footsteps seem to contain the echoes of greater dao, with holy radiance enveloping him whenever he stepped a move, giving others a great pressure as though heaven and earth would collapse under his rage.

When Lin Yun turned around, his aura changed as his sword intent transformed and bloomed in his pupils. This made Cao Yang because he could sense a dangerous aura coming from Lin Yun, and it felt as though his heart was being clenched, and the holy radiance he gave off extinguished.

Cao Yang squinted because Ye Qingtian’s Astral Sword Intent was really horrifying. But he wasn’t too bothered about it and threw a punch over.
