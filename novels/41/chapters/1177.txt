Chapter 1178 - Huge Misunderstanding

“Hahaha! It’s enough with those words of yours.” The Suspend King Palace’s palace master patted on his interspatial pouch and a black spear flew towards Chu Tianhao.

Upon looking at the black spear, Chu Tianhao’s eyes lit up. After all, he no longer had a saint artifact after his previous one was taken by Flower Burial. When he removed the black cloak covering the spear, a terrifying spear flickering with silver light appeared before Chu Tianhao.

“Blackbreak!” Chu Tianhao had the joy on his face because this was the best saint artifact that the Suspend King Palace had. The core was a sixth-grade saint rune, and the saint artifact had 400 saint runes. It was a lot stronger than his previous saint artifact.

“I’m only lending to you, and it’ll be yours if you can become the champion,” said the Suspend King Palace’s palace master.

“It’s nothing.” Chu Tianhao said, toying with the saint artifact in his hand.

At the same time, there was a black-clothed youth standing in front of the plump middle-aged man in the Heavenly Astral Pavilion in the Demon Domain. If there was someone from the Ancient Barren Land here, they would definitely be able to recognize this person, a rising star of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion, Zhang He.

He had only made a breakthrough to the Empyrean Realm for a year, and he had already reached the top 5,000 on the Empyrean Ranking. The Empyrean Ranking consists of all the empyreans in the Eastern Domain with no restriction to age. The fact that Zhang He could make it into the top 5,000 was enough to prove what a genius he was.

Those who could make it into the top 10,000 were all in the complete mastery of the Astral Stage, and those who could make it in the top 5,000 could fight one against ten. They could even slay quasi--Elysium Core Realm experts like nothing.

“Are you certain that this Flower Burial will participate in the ranking battle?” Zhang He asked.

“He will definitely show up. I’m certain that he’s from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect!” The plump middle-aged man said.

This time, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was placed in a dangerous spot because they would cease to exist if they couldn’t be the champion. So it made no sense that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect wouldn’t get him to participate.

“That’s for the best. Otherwise, the ranking battle will be meaningless,” said the black-clothed youth. Flower Burial was the only one who had succeeded in leaving after causing trouble in the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. The bounty for Flower Burial in the Heavenly Astral Pavilion had even reached the height of some Elysium Core Realm experts.

So it would be boring for him if Flower Burial didn’t show up. Otherwise, he would have no interest in such a small place like the Profound Azure Prefecture.

Hearing what Zhang He said, the plump middle-aged man replied, “Don’t act too proud only to fail in the end. Chu Tianhao of the Suspend King Palace has probably reached the 12th stage in the Suspend King Art. Furthermore, Ye Ziling of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect isn’t an easy opponent either. Her talent in the sword was outstanding even in the Ancient Barren Domain. Furthermore… that fellow from the Blood Moon Elysium will probably show up this time.”

“Oh?” Zhang He’s eyes shone with light because the Blood Moon Elysium had its forces enveloping the entire world. He heard that there was a monstrous genius hidden in the Profound Azure Prefecture’s branch of Blood Moon Elysium.

“Now I’m excited!” Zhang He revealed a cruel smile with his eyes squinted.

“But I have to tell you to kill all the disciples from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect regardless of who they are. That’s the only way you can force Flower Burial to show up!” The plump middle-aged man said coldly. After the recent incident, Flower Burial had simply become his nightmare. But there was nothing he could do as long as Flower Burial was under the protection of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s sect master.

At the very least, no demonic cultivators in the Elysium Core Realm dared to look for Flower Burial in the Profound Azure Prefecture. But the ranking battle was different because killing was within the rules and no sect master could intervene.

“Don’t worry. I’m here for Flower Burial, so how will I let my chance go?” Zhang He replied.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. On the lake where the Spirit Astral Mountain was located, Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan were cultivating. After the two of them had successfully reached the Astral Stage a few days ago, their strength had undergone a great boost.

This was the special treatment that Ye Ziling gave them. Aside from Ye Ziling and Jiang Lichen, Feng Zhang, Liu Qingyan, and Lin Yun would be participating in the ranking battle.

Feng Zhang opened his eyes and let out a long sigh. As for Liu Qingyan, he had already woken up from his cultivation a long time ago. Cultivating here for half a month was equivalent to a month of cultivation, and it was all thanks to Lin Yun. If Lin Yun didn’t break the ninth layer of heaven and reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, they wouldn’t be able to reach the Astral Stage so quickly.

“Lin Yun is really someone blessed with fortune. He’s caused such huge changes to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect in just half a year. If Lin Yun had come to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect a few years ago, I can’t even imagine how strong our sect’s foundation would be right now!” Feng Zhang sighed while Liu Qingyan nodded his head in agreement. Regardless of the bell from the Sword Saint Mountain or the ninth layer of heaven, all the disciples greatly benefited.

“Alright. Time for us to end our cultivation. Lin Yun and Senior Sister Ye must be waiting for us. Let us give the Suspend King Palace a huge surprise this time!” Liu Qingyan declared. He was filled with confidence after reaching the Astral Stage. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect have been waiting for this day for a long time. When the two of them left the lake, they both executed their movement technique and sped toward the designated location of the meeting. It didn’t take long for them to see Ye Ziling, Wang Yuruo, and a few elders.

“Did you guys see Senior Brother Lin along the way?” Wang Yuruo asked with anticipation in her eyes.

“We didn’t. He probably has something that he's taking care of right now.” Feng Zhang smiled. He believed that Lin Yun would show up since he had already given his promise.

While everyone talked among themselves, Ye Ziling didn’t speak a word. She would occasionally look in the direction of Lin Yun’s residence with anticipation flashing in her pupils.

Right at this moment, a figure swiftly approached that drew everyone’s attention. Wang Yuruo exclaimed, “Senior Brother Lin!”

But when that figure approached, they couldn’t help feeling disappointed because it was Jiang Lichen, not Lin Yun. When Jiang Lichen swept his glance at them, he smiled, “Are you guys waiting for Lin Yun? Don’t bother because he won’t be coming.”

“What do you mean?” Everyone else frowned their brows when they heard that.

“I already said that Lin Yun won’t come. I saw Luo Hua entering his residence with a Profound Astral Bird. You guys know the Profound Astral Bird, right? It’s the demonic beast that one uses when traveling across several manors. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect only has three of them, so you should understand!" Jiang Lichen’s words instantly made everyone’s faces change.

“He’s already standing at such a high position, so why would he stay in the Profound Azure Prefecture? He’s probably following Luo Hua to her saint clan. You guys consider him as a friend, but his only friend is Luo Hua,” smiled Jiang Lichen.

“That’s enough,” barked Liu Qingyan.

“Am I wrong? Who knows, he might even wed into the saint clan. A genius like him isn’t someone that our Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect can retain.” Jiang Lichen continued without any change on his face. After all, he had witnessed Luo Hua entering Lin Yun’s residence.

“I don’t believe it. I want to ask Senior Brother Lin about it! I don’t believe that he would lie to us!” Wang Yuruo sobbed but was held by Ye Ziling the moment she wanted to run.

At the same time, a violent wind swept out from Lin Yun’s residence with a light soaring into the sky. Shortly after, a bird flickering with blue light shot out of Lin Yun’s residence. On the spacious back of the bird was an azure figure. The group could only see his back and sword box, but that was all they needed to confirm it was Lin Yun. Then, they heard the sound of a jade flute drift out as the bird flew away.

“This is…” Seeing that it was really Luo Hua and Lin Yun, Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan were both left dumbfounded.

“Senior Brother Lin!” Wang Yuruo bawled because she couldn’t imagine that Lin Yun really left with Luo Hua. Lin Yun had clearly given his promise to them, so why did he change all of a sudden?

“Silly lass…” Ye Ziling embraced Wang Yuruo and comforted her. When she raised her head to look at Lin Yun who had already disappeared, she knew that they might probably never meet again in their lifetime.

It was a good choice for Lin Yun to join a saint clan. But Ye Ziling shook her head because she had grown up in the Radiant Snow Saint Clan, and she knew that she wanted to come to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect against everyone’s disagreement.

This was her choice, and everyone had the right to make choices in their life.
