Chapter 1809 - Glory Saint Artifact, Myriad Scales Armor

Not long after Liu Yunfei died, the Nine Lotus Diagram within Lin Yun’s embrace began to tremble again with a terrifying fluctuation spreading out, and the fluctuation was so great that the Nine Lotus Diagram nearly flew out.

“Lin Xiao, let me out! Let me out!

“What is this place? Let me out, you bastard!” Liu Cheng was already in despair because he could feel his vitality swiftly being devoured, and this naturally enveloped him in fear.

Lin Yun formed the Nine Lotus Saint Seal to completely seal off the Nine Lotus Diagram, and he muttered, “One man's meat is another man's poison…”

The Nine Lotus Diagram was a powerful treasure to him, but it was a living hell for Liu Cheng. Or maybe even hell wasn’t so terrifying. He might be holding on now, but it wouldn’t be long till he loses his life.

“The Wind Edge Lord is coming soon.” Lin Yun muttered to himself.

With a few flickers, the Wind Edge Lord finally caught up. Just earlier, he saw Lin Yun killing three people, except for Liu Cheng. He had no idea about what happened to him. He had witnessed the death of the other two, and he was completely dumbfounded by what he saw.

“They’re all trash!” The Wind Edge Lord became furious. When Liu Hai died, it could be said that he was careless, thus giving Lin Yun the opportunity to kill him with a Glory Saint Artifact. But he couldn’t accept the failure of Liu Hai, Liu Feng, and Liu Yunfei, who were prepared. Not to mention that they were fighting three against one.

In the end, he could only blame it on the experts nurtured by a clan that lacked competition compared to a sect, and those three were garbage. As the Wind Edge Lord’s face changed, a cold murderous intent began to radiate from him.

He wanted to know what treasure Lin Yun used to deal with Liu Cheng. The latter was at the pinnacle of the third stage Profound Life Stage, not to mention he often fought with enemies with his life on the line. The other three were different, but Liu Cheng was an expert among the Liu Saint Clan’s elders.

But someone like that was so easily suppressed by Lin Yun. This made the Wind Edge Lord feel a chill run down his spine. The thought of fleeing crossed his mind, but it only appeared for a moment before it disappeared. Lin Yun had to die here, no matter what.

Even if those four were garbage, they were still elders of the Liu Saint Clan, and they were nurtured with a great amount of resources. Not to mention the time they used was measured in centuries.

The losses today were great, and he wouldn’t be able to explain to the clan when he gets back. So he didn’t exactly have a choice.

The Wind Edge Lord coldly looked at Lin Yun, “As expected of a genius from the Azure Dragon’s lineage. Lin Xiao, I have to admit that I underestimated you. But it has come to an end now!”

“I already guessed that you wouldn’t immediately run away, but it doesn’t matter now. Even if you run, it would just take a longer time for me to kill you.” Lin Yun said, raising his head.

The Wind Edge Lord was furious when he heard those words, and he furiously roared, “Lin Xiao, you’re really arrogant. Have you not wondered as to why I’m still standing here after seeing how you killed four of my elders? Do you think I don’t have the confidence to stay?”

“Oh?” Lin Yun indifferently looked at the Wind Edge Lord.

“You’re a frog in the well! I might’ve been powerless against you when I was still at the Dragon Pulse Realm, but do you still think we’re on the same level after I reached the Samsara Edict Realm?” The Wind Edge Lord said coldly. “My foundation in the Dragon Pulse Realm far surpassed those elders. They can’t even make it into the top thousandths when they were on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, but I was in the top ten!”

“Are you comforting yourself? You don’t have to do that because you can never understand the power of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. The sword technique I used when facing the tribulation also isn’t something you can comprehend. That wasn’t something that can be grasped at the Dragon Pulse Realm.” Lin Yun said.

“You’re too confident in yourself. Let me show you my confidence for chasing after you!” The Wind Edge Lord sneered. When a constellation appeared behind him, the painting unfolded and revealed a silver dragon. That was his Divine Dragon Constellation.

That was a powerful constellation, and all the spiritual energy within the surroundings started pouring into his body when the divine dragon appeared. The Wind Edge Lord’s cultivation was at the second stage Profound Life Stage, and he could unleash a terrifying suppression under the empowerment of the constellation. The pressure that he gave off was even stronger than Liu Cheng’s.

He was only at the second stage Profound Life Stage, but he was even stronger than the four elders combined. This was the Wind Edge Lord’s foundation, and it wasn't something the elders could be compared to.

Not to mention the Wind Edge Lord grasped the Dragon Clan’s martial techniques. Regardless of the Divine Dragon Overlord Fist or Silver Dragon Saint Physique, it brought him a drastic transformation after reaching the Samsara Edict Realm. As their power combined together, it allowed the Wind Edge Lord to give off a horrifying pressure.

“Divine Dragon Overlord Fist!” The Wind Edge Lord began to pour his dragon origin that was empowered by the profound life aura into his fist. When he threw his punch forth, a dragon roar condensed into a ball before flying towards Lin Yun.

Before his punch even arrived, the sea beneath Lin Yun’s foot already sank in with terrifying cracks appearing in the surroundings. At this moment, it felt as though the entire world was within his control.

But Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless. He let go of the sword, and the Flower Burial Sword flew over like a beam. Lin Yun also circulated his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, and the Flower Burial Sword summoned him over. He instantly appeared behind the Wind Edge Lord and grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword.

“What’s going on?” The Wind Edge Lord exclaimed. He had seen similar scenes before multiple times. Back then, he thought Lin Yun’s speed was too fast. But he never expected that it would still be so shocking, even after he reached the Samsara Edict Realm.

The moment Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword, he circulated the Azure Dragon Intent with a thunderstorm rising up. His sword ray radiated the horizon, and he roared, “Unrivaled•Thunderstorm Slash!”

The Wind Edge Lord was a strong opponent, so Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless. He unleashed his strongest attack the moment he made a move.

His body was divided into two, one wielding wind and the other wielding lightning before swinging their swords. When the two sword rays intertwined, the violent thunderstorm energy caused the surrounding space to distort.

At such a close distance, there was no way the Wind Edge Lord could block his attack. The point where the two sword rays intertwined landed on the Wind Edge Lord’s heart, and the Flower Burial Sword attempted to pierce into his chest.

But when Lin Yun’s sword came in contact with the Wind Edge Lord’s chest, it caused sparks to fly. This made Lin Yun surprised with doubt flickering within his pupils. He was certain that he had already used the Glorymetal Spirit within his Flower Burial Sword.

He exhausted nearly one-third of his dragon origin, but it only caused sparks to fly. He couldn’t even touch the Wind Edge Lord’s body.

When the Wind Edge Lord was knocked away, he pushed his palms forth. Multiple dragons flew over, simultaneously landing on Lin Yun when the Flower Burial Sword fell onto him. The attacks shattered the dragon runes on Lin Yun’s chest, and this made Lin Yun spat out a mouthful of blood before he was sent a thousand meters away.

The Wind Edge Lord was at the second stage Profound Life Stage, but he had an even stronger foundation than Liu Cheng. Under the empowerment of the Silver Dragon Saint Physique, the power of this attack was extremely terrifying, even if Lin Yun had a powerful physique. Under the difference in their cultivation, Lin Yun instantly suffered severe injuries.

Lin Yun fell into the sea, causing a huge wave before he soared into the sky. When Lin Yun was in mid-air, he threw out a mouthful of blood and his face became pale. His internal organs were torn under the massive power, and his body was like a sculpture that could collapse at any moment. The injuries he suffered weren’t something he could recover from, even with the Blue Dragon Bone.

“Glory Saint Artifact?” Lin Yun had no fear in his pupils as he stared at the silver dragon coiling around the Wind Edge Lord.

The Wind Edge Lord looked at the heavily injured Lin Yun, and smiled, “Not bad. Now, do you know where my confidence comes from? Don’t think that you’re the only one with a Glory Saint Artifact. Your sword is incomparable to my Myriad Scales Armor!”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

As the Wind Edge Lord circulated his dragon origin, multiple silver dragon scales appeared on the surface of his body. The scales were engraved with ancient runes, emitting a powerful dragon aura.

This was a saint armor forged with dragon scales, possessing the power of dragons that wrapped around his body. At this moment, the Wind Edge Lord looked like a mighty god.

The Myriad Scales Armor was forged with the actual scales of pure-blooded dragons along with dragon skin, tendons, blood, and the Dragon Clan’s unique forging technique. Putting it on, it could merge with the flesh and bestow a powerful defense.

The dragon scales also contained great power, and this Glory Saint Armor was even more powerful than the two God Generals’ Nethermoon Saint Armor.
