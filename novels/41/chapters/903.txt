Chapter 904 - Dragon Clan Wines

After taking the pot and cup, Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto the liquid in the pool. The pool might have started out as water, but after being permeated by wine aroma for so long, it became extraordinary and was filled with dense spiritual energy.

“It’s a little wasteful to give up on this. I might as well refine it all.” Lin Yun sat in the pool and felt a chill rising up his body. When the wine aroma entered his body, the chill instantly disappeared and he felt his organs burning up with his bones.

Even with his powerful physique, he couldn’t help feeling an aching pain throughout his body. At the same time, the yin-yang circle in his violet palace started to burn violently. It sounds like meat was sizzling as everything in his body was burning. In the next second, Lin Yun’s body swelled up. The origin energy in his body was increasing too fast for his physique to digest.

Lin Yun quickly started circulating both sword sutras. When his sword sutras made a full circulation, the violent aura settled down. It was only a moment ago that his body felt like it would blow up.

As the water level in the pool decreased once more, Lin Yun’s cultivation surged violently. However, it wasn’t accompanied by any phenomena or an earth-shaking aura. Just like that, Lin Yun smoothly made his breakthrough into the Heavenly Soul Realm.

The origin energy in his violet palace transformed into an aura ocean that contained more origin energy than before. But the scale of his aura ocean didn’t look like someone who had just reached the Heavenly Soul Realm as it was over thirty thousand meters.

An hour later, Lin Yun finally opened his eyes and let out a deep sigh. He could sense that his body had undergone a transformation as he looked like a perfect jade.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I made a breakthrough just like that?” Lin Yun had been stuck in the pinnacle quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm for a long time and his sword sutras had also reached their limit a long time ago. It was just a matter of time for him to make a breakthrough, but it surprised him how smooth it was.

With a single thought, Lin Yun unleashed his pressure in the lesser Heavenly Soul Realm. His azure-purple aura ocean’s origin energy was more refined than it was in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. Along with his breakthrough, the quality of his origin energy had undergone a thorough transformation. He could clearly sense that his strength had doubled.

Suddenly, Lin Yun pushed his palm out and executed the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm. One after another ancient flaming seals began to condense. In the next second, the number of gold seals easily reached eight.

Dissipating the flaming seals on his palm, Lin Yun couldn’t help being surprised as his boost in strength was greater than he imagined. It wasn’t easy for him to condense six gold seals back then. But now, he could easily condense eight gold seals without any trouble.

With a flash in his pupils, black dragon breath manifested on his palm. The dragon breath was the size of his fist, but Lin Yun could sense that the power was extremely terrifying.

In the past, he couldn’t find a method to use the azure dragon’s breath, but he had an idea after seeing his Flamecloud Incinerating Palm. He couldn’t couldn’t condense eight seals in the past and didn’t dare to try it without the fortune martial technique reaching the pinnacle.

But now, he knew he could give it a try. He knew that he wasn’t proficient in flame intent. But it would be different if he could combine the azure dragon breath and Flamecloud Incinerating Palm together. It would complete the fortune martial technique.

Lin Yun acted immediately. He slowly started to merge the azure dragon breath into the gold flaming seals. Without any restriction, the azure dragon breath combined with a gold flaming seal perfectly.

Upon succeeding, the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm contained a violent dragon aura. The gold flaming seal had turned black and emitted an ancient violent aura.

“It’s possible!” Joy flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes and he was curious what would happen when he executed the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm with black seals. Would a dragon claw fly out?

Right at this moment, a noise came from outside the hall and Lin Yun quickly extinguished the black flaming seal. Right at this moment, two pathetic-looking figures entered the wine cellar.

Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen had completely lost their rationale after reaching the second level and picked a random path. It resulted in them encountering a large number of demonic corpses. So it took them a great deal of effort to reach the third level.

When they looked at the wine on the third level, their eyes lit up and they started sweeping their eyes around. But soon, both their faces changed drastically.

“Divine dragon wine?”

“The pool of wine seems to be the Mo Clan’s Frost Jade Pool. My heavens, it can’t be the Millennium Flame, can it?!” Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were both dumbfounded when they felt the aura contained in the pool of wine. Their breathing became heavy and rapid.

“The two of you came at the right time,” said Lin Yun. He stood up from the pool of wine and looked at them with a smile.

“Lin Yun!” Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were both briefly stunned before they had joy written on their faces. But the joy only lasted for a split second before they calmed down.

“That’s right. I took the wine that was in this pool. As for the Millennium Flame? That’s a pretty interesting name,” smiled Lin Yun after guessing their thoughts. Right at this moment, Lil’ Red jumped off of a wine shelf after taking the last divine dragon wine.

Lil’ Red had completely emptied the third level. The scene left Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen dumbfounded as their lips twitched. So it was the Dragon-blooded Cat that swept through all of the halls? Wasn’t it a bit too greedy?

Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen’s bodies began to tremble and they even forgot to flare up.

“I’ll be taking my leave now. Farewell.” Lin Yun soared into the air and cupped his hands. With the holes in the roof, the lingering restriction in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion could no longer pose a threat to him. Just like that, Lin Yun and Lil’ Red disappeared.

“You want to leave?! Not so fast!” Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were both overwhelmed by rage and they unleashed their killing intent. Their killing intent was so strong that the entire Hidden Treasure Pavilion started to tremble violently.

They started their chase because there was no way they would let Lin Yun leave so easily.
