Chapter 2375 - Who Dare Claims To Be Invincible?!

Lin Yun didn’t put up with Tuoba Hong’s provocation and refuted his words, and his comment caused an uproar in the surroundings, making everyone nervous. After all, Tuoba Hong was a primordial beast, not a human cultivator possessing a demonic beast’s bloodline.

The Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf could be considered a Saint Beast, and yet Lin Yun called it a dog. This was too ruthless.

“Does he not know that Tuoba Hong has a fiery temper? He’s courting death,” Jiang Ziyao coldly said. “Tuoba Hong has long reached the eighth-stage Saint Lord, and he can kill a seventh-stage Saint Lord with a punch. As a primordial beast, he’s practically invincible against those who are at the same cultivation.”

The other geniuses continued to watch with a smile on their faces. As for the spectators, their faces also changed.

Veins popped on Tuoba Hong’s face as the moon on his forehead shone brightly. He coldly said, with murderous intent flashing in his eyes, “You think you can enrage me this way? Well, you’re only a seventh-stage Saint Lord, so you naturally have to resort to tricks if you want to defeat me.”

Shaking his head, he mocked, “An ant is an ant; what a pity.”

“You’re misunderstanding me. The so-called ‘Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf’ is merely a dog in my eyes, and I don’t even have to use my sword to deal with you,” Lin Yun smiled. His words caused an uproar with everyone finding him too cocky, slapping Tuoba Hong’s face multiple times.

“How dare you!” Tuoba Hong became furious as his long hair grew and his body swelled up. As silver moonlight shone on his body, a wild and noble temperament appeared simultaneously, and his silver hair grew so long that it nearly reached the ground. A silver moon then appeared in the sky with moonlight shining on Tuoba Hong, creating ripples in the surrounding space.

“Moon Domain!”

“That’s the innate talent of the Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf! It looks like he has become serious.”

“It looks like he’s determined to kill Lin Yun before he can admit defeat.” Exclamations came from the surrounding area.

“Gravity field?” As Lin Yun’s sword intent vibrated, he felt that his body was restricted when the moonlight shone on him. He fell into deep thoughts because the so-called “Moon Domain” made it feel like gravity had increased.

“It’s too late for you to beg for mercy now. No one can be my opponent in the Moon Domain!” Tuoba Hong grinned as he charged forth, leaving behind a silver flash that appeared as though he had thrown behind space.

When a giant explosion resounded, space shattered under his fist with a shockwave spreading out, causing Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain to tremble. Everything happened too quickly, and not even a sixth-stage Saint Lord could take this punch head-on. This was the terror of primordial beasts, and they could suppress human cultivators by relying on their physique.

As the five geniuses wore a smile, a bizarre scene occurred. Lin Yun stood on the same spot and merely raised his palm to block this fist. A mighty gale blew on Lin Yun’s face, causing his hair to flutter, and he was smiling, “You’re too slow. Is this the best you can do?”

Everyone was dumbfounded with disbelief because Tuoba Hong’s attack, which felt like a volcano, was so easily blocked by Lin Yun. If Tuoba Hong was the king of beasts, Lin Yun would be the beast tamer.

“How is this possible?!” Many cultivators exclaimed.

Tuoba Hong squinted with disbelief. When he tried pulling his fist back, he was shocked to discover that Lin Yun’s fingers felt like a dragon’s claw with thunderstorms forming in his palm, pulling his fist over. He realized that he couldn’t move. When he raised his head, he saw a smile on Lin Yun’s face, and threw a punch with his left fist at it.

There was no way Lin Yun could dodge from such a close distance. When everyone wanted to see how Lin Yun would block this attack, everyone saw Lin Yun twist Tuoba Hong’s fist with a smile. As thunderstorms raged, a violent gale blew and Tuoba Hong was forced to take ten-odd steps back, resolving the other punch from Tuoba Hong.

Lin Yun smiled, and he gestured for Tuoba Hong to continue. An exclamation resounded from the surroundings because Lin Yun didn’t place Tuoba Hong in his eyes. They had to admit that Lin Yun looked elegant at this moment.

Tuoba Hong was furious as he charged forth. This time, silver lightning began to flash on his body, and his speed increased.

Lin Yun merely pushed his hands forth and a golden lotus appeared behind him, the Sovereign Dao, Azure Dragon Dao. At the same time, Lin Yun’s blood began to boil with an azure dragon’s aura sweeping out.

Lin Yun faced Tuoba Hong head-on, using speed against speed. Relying on the Azure Dragon Divine Physique and Azure Dragon Dao, he fought Tuoba Hong evenly. But if one looked at them closely, they would discover Lin Yun was more composed in the fight. One attacked while the other defended.

Tuoba Hong’s attacks were densely packed, but they were futile against Lin Yun. This naturally made Tuoba Hong greatly shocked because the Moon Domain increased the surrounding gravity ten times, and yet Lin Yun was fine in his domain and was even more composed than him.

Seeing through Tuoba Hong’s thoughts, Lin Yun smiled. After all, ten times the gravity was nothing to him since he trained on Blood Purgatory Mountain. Did Tuoba Hong really think that the Kunlun Realm didn’t have any inheritance?

Lin Yun roared with a dragon’s roar echoing from within his body, and his blood began to boil. With a thunderstorm enveloping his fist, his punch landed on Tuoba Hong’s chest.

Blood dripped from Tuoba Hong’s lips, and he took several steps back before he regained his footing.

This scene made everyone take a deep breath. Even the faces of the five geniuses changed, and their eyelids twitched with disbelief.

“He reached such heights with the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. He has hidden himself deeply, and even formed the Dragon’s Soul. He asked me what the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet is for... he must’ve used it,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled as he stroked his beard. In his view, Lin Yun was probably after the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. As for the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet, he had probably used it. Lin Yun only asked that to divert his attention; otherwise, Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Divine Physique wouldn’t be so strong.

Ji Zixi curiously asked, “Grandpa Profound Sky, what do you mean?”

Profound Sky Venerable was in a good mood, and he smiled, “He’s bluffing me. He must’ve already used the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet. Don’t worry; your Big Brother Lin won’t die.”

Ji Zixi’s face blushed, but she felt Big Brother Lin didn’t use the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet. However, seeing that the Profound Sky Venerable was so confident, she heaved a sigh in relief and wore a smile that captivated many people. Many people’s hearts throbbed when they saw her smile since she was so beautiful.

The situation on the stage changed as Tuoba Hong roared upon feeling humiliated. The silver moon in the sky became massive, looking like a real moon, and everyone could even see the craters on the moon.

Tuoba Hong grimaced, before returning to his Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf’s beast form. It was a massive wolf with gorgeous silver fur, releasing the aura of a primordial beast. As Tuoba Hong roared, the Moon Domain shone brightly.

“Fifty times the gravity! Let me see how you’re going to fight me!” Tuoba Hong roared, causing a commotion in the surroundings. This was the first time many saw Tuoba Hong’s actual form, and they had to admit it was terrifying.

But Lin Yun merely looked at the silver moon before turning to Tuoba Hong, and smiled, “A dog under the moon?”

Everyone’s lips twitched upon hearing that. After all, Lin Yun was still in the mood to tease Tuoba Hong even after the latter brought out his actual form.

“I’ll eat you!” Tuoba Hong’s eyes became crimson as he swung his claw down. There wasn’t any technique in this attack but brute strength, and the powerful gale it produced made many people shut their eyes.

But Lin Yun was calm as the Azure Dragon Divine Rune bloomed in his heart before turning into blood threads that spread throughout his body. Sensing the power within his body, Lin Yun couldn’t hold back and let out a roar. He pushed his palm forth as the divine rune flashed, and he faced Tuoba Hong’s claw head-on.

After one clash, the two separated. They stood a hundred feet from each other, and the power radiating from them became massive as the Azure Dragon and Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf clashed. They savagely fought, making the faces of the surrounding spectators change.

It wasn't long before Tuoba Hong was covered in wounds. Lin Yun was also injured, but since a dragon aura coiled around him, his injuries swiftly recovered. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Blue Dragon Bone!” Jiang Ziyao exclaimed, causing a commotion in the surroundings. After all, the Blue Dragon Bone was extremely precious, even in the three thousand realms, and yet Lin Yun possessed one.

“It’s really the Blue Dragon Bone!”

“Lin Yun is too heaven-defying! He wants to reforge the glory of the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity!”

“It looks like the Kunlun Realm is going to rise!”

“It’s no wonder why he looked so confident!” All the swordsmen felt their blood boiling when they watched Lin Yun’s fight against Tuoba Hong.

A hundred moves later, Tuoba Hong was knocked down from the sky by a dragon. When he fell to the ground, Tuoba Hong rolled and screamed. But under the moonlight, he was swiftly recovering, and the aura he gave off became even more terrifying. Was this a primordial beast?

“I’m invincible under the moon!” Tuoba Hong roared. His roar seemed to receive the resonation of the primordial wolf, and everyone could hear a buzzing noise in their ears, with their souls trembling as they began to bleed from their ears.

“Invincible? Who gave you the guts to say that?!” Lin Yun laughed as he slammed his palms on the ground with his sleeves fluttering like a wave.

As the Azure Dragon Divine Rune began to revolve within his body, a vortex of thunderstorms appeared before his chest. Lin Yun laughed with his hair fluttering. He roared, “Azure Dragon’s Rage!”

This was a shocking scene as the silver moon began to expand in everyone’s eyes. This was because the silver moon was approaching. When everyone wondered what was happening, Lin Yun opened his mouth and devoured the silver moon using the thunderstorm vortex.

Everyone was shocked by this scene. With the moon now gone, the aura released by Tuoba Hong began to decline. On the contrary, Lin Yun’s aura began to rise after devouring the silver moon, and his aura formed into a silver beam of light, piercing the clouds.

The stars in the sky became dim, and only Lin Yun shone brightly. The aura that he gave off left everyone dumbfounded with disbelief.

“Lin Yun is here. Who dares to claim to be invincible?!” Lin Yun roared, pushing his right hand forth with the Azure Dragon’s Rage revolving in his palm. The distorting power hit Tuoba Hong, covering him in blood.

When Tuoba Hong was sent flying away, all the flesh on his body had disappeared, leaving behind a skeletal frame. This was terrifying, frightening everyone in the surrounding area.
