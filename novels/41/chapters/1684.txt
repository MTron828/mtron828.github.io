Chapter 1685 – Nine Profound Heavenly Dance

A thousand miles away, they could feel the immense pressure that the city was giving off. It was located at the heart of the Eastern Desolation, attracting many forces to settle in the city. Thus, the city unbelievably flourished.

Lin Yun quietly executed the Divine Dragon Eyes to look at the city and noticed that the city's sky was enveloped in tens of millions of saint runes that had merged into the fog. The saint runes formed a massive spiritual array that surrounded the entire city, causing those who looked at it to feel tiny in comparison.

Through the fog, he could see multiple hovering smaller islands around the city, and those islands were like overturned mountains. The massive cities and palaces built on those islands made it look like an isolated world.

The docking for ships was large, and their sizes were no different from islands. There were thirty-five such docks, and everyone had to pass through them before entering Heavenly Domain City.

The Heavenly Note Sect came prepared, so their ship wasn’t checked. They didn’t even have to queue up before they were let into the city. This surprised Lin Yun because even Samsara Edict Realm experts were obediently queuing up, so this should be the treatment of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. He saw that they were let into the city after Lin Wan took out a token.

They entered a sea region enveloped in white fog when they made it through the dock. He could sense the dense spiritual energy in the fog and devoured some of it by just opening his mouth.

“This place is really mysterious. Hasn’t anyone thought of occupying the entire city before?” Lin Yun asked, looking at the massive outline of the city.

“Not including the Demon Gate and Blood Moon Sect, the Eastern Desolation has six holy lands. No matter who occupied it, they would be ganged upon by the other holy lands. The Demon Gate and Blood Moon Sect don’t have the guts; otherwise, the six holy lands would eradicate them.” Lin Wan smiled.

There were tens of thousands of islands in the outer region of the Heavenly Domain City, and the inner region was divided into four districts. They were the Vermillion Bird, Black Tortoise, White Tiger, and Azure Dragon Districts, and each district had countless forces stationed in them.

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion was located in the Vermillion Bird District, one of the most flourishing districts in the Heavenly Domain City. After arriving at the Vermillion Bird District, Lin Yun temporarily bade farewell to the Heavenly Note Pavilion’s party. He had already told them he had to see a friend before going to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

“Young Master Lin, you can come to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion three days from now with this token.” Lin Wan smiled as she handed the token she had used previously to Lin Yun.

“Okay.” Lin Yun was somewhat surprised because this token probably had a considerable origin, so this meant that Lin Wan really trusted him.

“Let us meet again three days from now, then.” Luo Shuyi smiled.

“Young Master Lin, you have to come within three days!” The other Heavenly Note Pavilion’s disciples said. They were pretty passionate.

Seeing this, Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling at his charm before he started asking around for the Heavenly Star Pavilion’s location. He spent half a day before he came to a massive building. Rather than calling this a building, it was majestic, like a mountain.

“Heavenly Star Pavilion!” Lin Yun looked at the colossal signboard before him. Each of the words contained a massive power. It was as if he was in a starry sky, watching countless stars being destroyed.

The Heavenly Star Pavilion was really grand. Anyone could tell that the property in this city wasn’t cheap, but they could occupy such a vast area. This proved that the force standing behind the Heavenly Star Pavilion wasn’t simple. But it made sense since the Demon Gate was behind the Heavenly Star Pavilion. After all, the Demon Gate was the overlord of all demonic forces in the Kunlun Realm.

Just when Lin Yun was about to enter the Heavenly Star Pavilion, Lin Wan and others arrived at the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. This was a large patch of mountains with gorgeous terrain. There were a total of thirty-six spiritual mountains, and the mountains formed the massive Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

The thirty-six spiritual mountains were connected, and the scale wasn’t inferior to any powerful sects in the Ancient Barren Domain. The mountains were covered with flowers and various hovering palaces, making the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion look like a celestial realm.

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi smoothly entered the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, reaching the highest mountain out of the thirty-six mountains, which was snowy. Along the way, they could see disciples of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion playing their instruments, cultivating by themselves, or chatting amongst themselves. All their disciples were studs and beauties, looking ethereal.

When they reached the peak of the snowy mountain, the surrounding voices died. There wasn’t anyone else around here except a woman dancing in the snow. At the peak of the snowy mountain, there was a holy lake, and a red-dressed lady was dancing at the lake’s heart.

She was charming, possessing an ethereal temperament. She was focused, and her pupils were filled with spirituality. She was undoubtedly a beauty, looking like a fairy that didn’t belong to this world, a demoness without flaws.

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi were both beauties, but they paled when compared to this lady. As Lin Wan looked at this lady dancing at the lake’s heart, she smiled and exclaimed, “I wonder what Lin Yun did in his past life to receive the favor of Weiwei in the Profound Amber Realm.”

“But no one knows if Lin Yun is still alive. I’m afraid…” Luo Shuyi’s gaze dimmed down.

This red-dressed lady was Yue Weiwei. When Yue Weiwei stopped, she furrowed her brows and wasn’t too satisfied with her dance, which looked like the dance of a fairy in the eyes of others. But when she saw Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi, a smile soon rose on her lips, and she hopped her way over to them.

“Big Sister Luo, Big Sister Lin, you guys are finally back!” Yue Weiwei held onto the two ladies’ hands with her eyes shining brightly. She said, “Quick, tell me more about Big Brother Yun.”

She already knew Lin Yun was in the Ancient Barren Domain, but it was all second-hand information, and she could only find more exact information about him through Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi. So she had been waiting for them for a long time.

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi exchanged a glance with bitter smiles before they shared Lin Yun’s experiences in the Ancient Barren Domain with Yue Weiwei. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After Yue Weiwei heard what they said, she smiled, “Big Brother Yun is really formidable to achieve so much in just two years in the Kunlun Realm.”

“You’re not worried about his life and death?” Luo Shuyi asked in shock.

“I’m naturally worried, but I know Big Brother Yun isn’t someone who will die so easily. He suffered a lot in the Profound Amber Realm, and he killed his way through the Heavenly Path. The life and death experiences he has gone through far surpass the other holy sons and holy maidens. So it’s not that easy to kill him.” Yue Weiwei smiled, and her laughter was filled with great confidence for Lin Yun.

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi no longer said anything upon seeing Yue Weiwei’s confidence. They then told her how they met Lin Xiao in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea.

“Give him a quota?” Yue Weiwei smiled, “If his strength is as big sisters said, it’s not an issue to let him join the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. But there are many monstrous geniuses in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. So I’m afraid others might have an opinion about him if he immediately entered.”

“This person isn’t simple. He probably already possessed the strength of a musician long ago. Not to mention that he might even have grasped the Saint Tone. The songs he played are all ancient songs, so he must have an inheritance.”

“Since Big Sister Lin holds him with such high opinion, is he stronger than my Big Brother Yun?” Yue Weiwei smiled.

Lin Wan couldn’t help smiling, and she replied, “Lin Yun is definitely stronger. After all, there isn’t anyone in the Kunlun Realm and Divine Dragon Era that doesn’t know the name of Flower Burial.”

“Not bad.” Yue Weiwei briefly pondered before she replied, “How about this? Bring him to meet Elder Mu three days from now and tell her that I’m the one who recommended him.”

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi let out a sigh of relief when they heard that. With Yue Weiwei’s recommendation, it should be certain that Lin Yun could obtain a quota.

“Hehe, let’s not talk about that for now and chat with me. My master won’t let me go down the mountain if I can’t dance the Nine Profound Heavenly Dance well. I’m dead bored.” Yue Weiwei said.

Hearing that, Lin Wan instantly knew that Yue Weiwei was probably bored to death here. The Nine Profound Heavenly Dance was created by the Nine Profound Heavenly Fairy, an ancient deity. The Nine Profound Heavenly Dance that she created was profound, known as one of the ten profound dances in the Kunlun Realm.

Upon reaching the pinnacle, one could shake the thirty-six layers of heaven and dim the starry sky. The complete dance was long lost, and the one passed down was incomplete. The Four Musical Houses each preserved a portion of the dance. Cultivating it was tough, but it would unleash a terrifying might if anyone could reach the threshold of it.
