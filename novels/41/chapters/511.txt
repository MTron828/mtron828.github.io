Chapter 512 - Going To Teach Who A Lesson?

The arrogance in Yang Xiong’s tone made others feel helpless. Not only was he arrogant, but he practically had his nose in the sky and completely disregarded Lin Yun.

Lin Yun felt weird. He didn’t know when he provoked this ‘deity.’ But shortly after, Lin Yun recalled that gaze from three days ago. Three days ago when he came up the Spiritwood Peak, he instantly noticed that there were many gazes directed at him. Among the various gazes, there was an eerie gaze that stood out. If he had guessed correctly, that gaze should belong to this Yang Xiong standing before him.

“Listen well. Distance yourself from Liu Yunyan in the future. Don’t let me see the two of you together again. Otherwise, I’ll make your life miserable in the academy,” snorted Yang Xiong as he turned around and left.

Lin Yun could vaguely guess the reason, but he didn’t expect that Yang Xiong would be so direct. Looking at Yang Xiong’s figure, Lin Yun wanted to call out to him, but it was already too late. In the end, Lin Yun could only smile bitterly. Truthfully speaking, there was nothing between him and Liu Yunyan. It was practically an uncalled for disaster because he had offended someone like Yang Xiong due to a misunderstanding.

“Deacon Lin.” A youth walked towards Lin Yun with a smile.

“You know me?” asked Lin Yun.

“I coincidentally witnessed how you humiliated Mo Feng before Mo Ling before the Imperial Study Hall. I’m also a guest deacon like yourself. My name is Gong Ming,” smiled the youth.

Lin Yun instantly knew why Gong Ming would call him Deacon Lin. So it turns out that they were both guest deacons. This instantly brought their relationship closer.

“Greetings, Deacon Gong,” replied Lin Yun.

“No need for such courtesy. After all, we’re both guest deacons. I’ll just call you Brother Lin. You’re really in a mess, not only did you offend Mo Ling, but you’ve even provoked Yang Xiong,” smiled Gong Ming. “Yang Xiong’s strength is terrifying and he is ranked eleventh among core disciples.”

“How many core disciples are there in the academy?”

“About a hundred. Unlike other sects, the academy emphasizes spiritual runes. The disciples may not have a high cultivation, but their attainments in spiritual runes are extremely powerful.”

Speaking of which, Yang Xiong was indeed impressive. There were tens of thousands of disciples in the academy, but there were only about a hundred core disciples. So they must be elites among elites, and Yang Xiong was impressive since he could make it into the eleventh spot. No wonder he was so arrogant.

“That fellow has been infatuated with Liu Yunyan for a long time. He’s also been rejected by Liu Yunyan several times, but he still attacks anyone who tries to get close to her. Many people have been taught a terrible lesson,” explained Gong Ming.

“No one cares about his actions?” wondered Lin Yun.

“Who can do anything about it? No one aside from the top ten can do anything about him. This is why everyone in the academy is afraid of him,” explained Gong Ming with a grave expression. “So you have to be cautious. He’s a ruthless person.”

“Understood,” smiled Lin Yun. Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of Yang Xiong and he wouldn’t offend anyone who didn’t provoke him. But if they were unreasonable, then he couldn’t be blamed for being impolite. Collecting his thoughts, Lin Yun smiled, “Brother Gong, you’re more familiar than me in the academy. Can we learn spiritual runes here?”

“You can learn them at the Nightcloud Hall. They have a lecturer that guides disciples every day in spiritual runes,” smiled Gong Ming. “Speaking of which, I’m heading there right now. We can go together if you don’t mind.”

“I naturally don’t.” Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t reject Gong Ming’s offer.

The academy was rather elegant, and the buildings were clearly decorated meticulously. With Gong Ming leading the way, they both reached the Nightcloud Hall quickly. The Nightcloud Hall had a spacious empty ground. There weren’t any constructs around and many disciples were seated on mats. There was a stone platform at the center for lecturers.

“There are quite a lot of people around here. I wonder who the lecturer is today.” Gong Ming looked around and he said, “Let’s find a place quickly.”

Right at this moment, a joyful voice called out to Lin Yun. It was Bai Yi, which was a pleasant surprise.

“Brother Gong, I’ll head over there first,” smiled Lin Yun.

Gong Ming casually nodded his head. But he soon found something amiss and turned his head over. If he remembered correctly, that place belonged to Gu Teng, who was a ferocious figure even among inner disciples. But before he could give Lin Yun a warning, he noticed that Lin Yun had already sat down.

In the end, Gong Ming could only smile bitterly as he hoped that Gu Teng wouldn’t be here today. But clearly, Lin Yun was unlucky as many people turned to look at Lin Yun with a playful gaze.

“You’re in the wrong seat.” A voice sounded out. When Lin Yun turned his head over, he saw a purple-clothed youth looking at him coldly.

“Sorry about that. I’ll go somewhere else then.” Lin Yun was new here, so he naturally didn’t know about the rules. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“You come and go as you wish. Interesting. No one dared to sit in my position, but since you dared to dirty my mat, then clean it with your tongue,” said the youth coldly.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he looked at the youth. It looks like no one wanted to be friendly to him here in the academy. Did they really think that he was a pushover?

“Brother Gu, don’t be mad. This is Lin Yun and he’s a new guest deacon. He doesn’t know the rules here. I’ll bring him away immediately,” said Gong Ming as he quickly came over. He pulled Lin Yun and whispered, “Brother Lin, don’t offend this person. Gu Teng has been promoted to a core disciple, so he currently has the highest attainments in spiritual runes among the inner disciples. He’s already a pinnacle second grade spiritualist. His elder brother is Gu Feng, a core disciple.”

“And look what we have here. Does trash like you hold any position to speak?” Gu Teng looked at Gong Ming. His words instantly made Gong Ming’s face sink as Gong Ming’s lips twitched. He was naturally unhappy that he was insulted publicly. But when he thought of Gu Teng’s identity, he ultimately swallowed his anger.

“Get lost. I can’t be bothered with you.” Gu Teng had no intention of letting Gong Ming off and gave him a slap. His slap was ruthless and he had fully unleashed his cultivation in the pinnacle lesser Yin stage. If Gong Ming was hit by this attack carelessly, he would definitely be in a terrible state.

But just when Gu Teng’s hand was about to slap Gong Ming, Gu Teng’s hand was grabbed in mid-air. No matter how Gu Teng struggled, he couldn’t break free from the grab.

“You’re really ruthless. Don’t you have parents that taught you manners?” Lin Yun said this with a faint smile, but his gaze was cold. When everyone saw this scene, they all looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. They couldn’t believe that the new kid dared to offend Gu Teng.

Gu Teng was in the pinnacle lesser Yin stage and a pinnacle second grade spiritualist. He would soon become a core disciple. Right now, he was the strongest among the inner disciples.

Gu Teng struggled, but when he realized that he couldn’t break free from Lin Yun’s grab, he smiled eerily, “I never imagined that you would be the first to retaliate. Great, now I don’t have to explain anything to the elders.”

He was arrogant and confident that Lin Yun had given him an excuse to attack.

“Senior Brother Gu Teng, don’t take it too far. Anyone can sit on the mats and there’s no fixed position. If you dare to touch Big Brother Lin, Big Sister Yunyan won’t let you off,” said Bai Yi as she puffed her cheeks.

“Liu Yunyan? And here I was wondering where a small guest deacon got such arrogance from. So it’s Liu Yunyan. But Liu Yunyan doesn’t frighten me,” smiled Gu Teng sinisterly.

Just when he was about to unleash his origin energy, a cold bark instantly stopped him, “Stop!”

A terrifying aura also swept over that instantly enveloped the entire place, causing everyone’s faces to turn pale. There was no doubt that the lecturer today was powerful. When everyone saw the newcomer, they all had joy on their faces, “Senior Sister Mo!”

Mo Ling was a famous figure in the academy and she was the only core disciple who grasped a divine ability. Therefore, many elders placed great importance in her. When Lin Yun saw this scene, he smiled bitterly because he knew that he couldn’t deal with this fellow today.

But when he looked at Gu Teng’s expression, Gu Teng’s face was also ugly. Clearly, he was grumbling that Mo Ling came at the wrong time. He was feeling vexed that he would have to explain things to Mo Ling, but Mo Ling didn’t even look at him. Instead, Mo Ling looked at Lin Yun coldly, “Deacon Lin’s temper is rather impressive. Are you trying to teach an elite inner disciple of my academy a lesson? Can it be that you’ve disregarded me?”
