Chapter 1568 - Ten-Star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, Charge!

When the Dragon Transforming Pool appeared before everyone, all the sects began to determine their quotas. It was easy for the Sword Sect because the six quotas naturally went to the five saint disciples first, Jiang Cheng, Ye Ziling, Ye Ziyun, Lin Yun, and Zhao Yan. As for the last quota, it went to Jin Xuanyi.

As one of the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking, Ji Shuxuan gave up on this opportunity, and the reason he gave up was simple. Jin Xuanyi was the one who fought for the Sword Sect. Even if he lost, he still contributed to the Sword Sect while he did nothing. This instantly made everyone think more highly of Ji Shuxuan, and they knew why he was Mu Xuankong’s disciple.

The quotas for the other sects were swiftly determined, and most were acquaintances of Lin Yun. Such as the Emerald Jade Manor’s Ning Feng, Vajra Monastery’s Cang Yun, Profound Valley’s Tang Jing, Heavenly Note Sect’s Luo Shuyi, Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s Nangong Yan, the Thunder Sect’s Dugu Yan, and Zhang Jin.

Nangong Yan was born at the wrong time because if it wasn’t for Lin Yun and Huang Xuanyi, he would definitely be the strongest at the Heavenly Pool Gathering.

When they came to the edge of the Dragon Transforming Pool, the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said, “All of you can enter the pool now. But the bottom of the pool is hot, and even Samsara Edict Realm experts can lose their lives there. So do not chew on more than you can handle. This pool is also deep, and the saints of the various sects speculated that it might be connected to a Divine Dragon Realm when they went down there in the past.

“As for how to open the entrance, no one has found it, not to mention the terrifying dragon aura and mysterious dragon silhouette in the depths of the pool. So not even saints can last a long time down there.”

This was precisely why the powerful sects ultimately gave up on the idea of monopolizing this Dragon Transforming Pool. This was because there was a long period of time for each opening, and the harvest depended only on luck. Thus, the eight powerful sects decided to set up the Heavenly Pool Gathering’s rules and share them.

Everyone nodded when they heard what the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said before they turned to look at the pool with flames blazing in the depths of their eyes. In the next second, Cang Yun, Nangong Yan, and others dove into the pool. The men were pretty straightforward in jumping into the pool.

“Hehe. Beauties, you guys can come down now. The Dragon Transforming Pool is really great!” Cang Yun chuckled at Luo Shuyi, Ye Ziling, and Ye Ziyun after he jumped into the pool. When he said that, everyone in the pool and on the edges was briefly stunned before they immediately turned to look at the ladies.

When Luo Shuyi and Ye Ziling heard that, their faces changed as they became bashful. Since Ye Ziyun had a fiery temper, she glared at Cang Yun. “You damn monk. Shut your mouth! I’m not close to you!”

“Hahaha. Don’t worry about it because no one will look at you. We’re not interested in Lady Ziling and Lady Shiyi!” Cang Yun laughed, and a similar expression also appeared on the faces of many.

Ye Ziling nearly threw out blood when she heard that, wanting to jump into the pool and teach that damn baldy a lesson. Ye Ziyun might be considered a beauty, but she was lacking when compared to Ye Ziling and Luo Shuyi. Everyone looked forward to seeing a cold beauty like Ye Ziling jumping into the pool.

“Luo Xi, that junior brother of yours is pretty capable.” Mu Xueqin said, looking at the leader of the Vajra Monastery.

Her words instantly placed Luo Xi in an awkward position, and he roared, “Cang Yun, shut your mouth and eyes! The Sword Sect gave us the quota. If you continue to run your mouth, I’ll make you get out of the pool!”

The Dragon Pulse Realm disciples from the other sects also reprimanded the fellow disciples of their sects. But when Ye Ziling took the lead in jumping into the Dragon Transforming Pool, several people in the pool still opened their eyes a little. But it was a pity that they couldn’t see anything.

When Ye Ziling jumped into the pool, a vortex immediately formed around her, and she became shrouded in a mist of astral energy. When Lin Yun and others also jumped into the pool, various energies began to intertwine.

“What pure divine dragon aura!” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he jumped into the pool. He could sense the boundless energy that filled the Dragon Transforming Pool. It was similar to his experience back in the Divine Dragon Pagoda.

Aside from the divine dragon aura, the Dragon Transforming Pool also seemed to contain a particular form of dragon flames that formed into a unique divine dragon's spiritual liquid. When the divine dragon spiritual liquid entered his body, Lin Yun could sense his astral energy boiling, and the nine stars in his violet palace all lit up.

As a massive vortex appeared around him, the size of the vortex became a lot bigger than everyone else’s combined. A countless amount of divine dragon spiritual liquid entered his body in the form of droplets of golden energy essence. This instantly created a spectacle in the pool as the golden energy converged towards Lin Yun.

Everyone else in the pool could immediately sense that something wasn’t right because the divine dragon spiritual liquid that they could absorb had decreased. When they opened their eyes and looked at Lin Yun, they were so shocked that their jaws nearly fell off.

“Holy shit!” Cang Yun cursed. After he was done cursing, he quickly closed his eyes to circulate his astral energy to devour as much as he could.

“What the hell is this?!”

“He’s not giving others a chance at all!” Someone finally couldn’t help yelling, and their faces became ugly. Although Lin Yun gave them this baptism chance, this was still too much. After they were done cursing, they began to circulate their cultivation techniques to the limit.

They could sense that the divine dragon spiritual liquid was limited. If Lin Yun absorbed too much, there would be less for others. Aside from that, they could also take the risk by going deeper into the pool. As for the Dragon Pulse Realm leaders from the various sects, they were all stumped while looking at the unbelievable vast vortex around Lin Yun.

“It’s no wonder why he can defeat Huang Xuanyi. His accumulation is too terrifying!”

“He seems to possess the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. This alone has allowed him to have a higher starting point than others, and his advantage in the pool is too great.”

“He also seems to have cultivated another sword sutra aside from the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. Dual sword sutras?”

“This is a little weird…” Although it was a simple absorbing process, all the Dragon Pulse Realm disciples naturally managed to tell the difference between the disciples.

Luo Yuan’s face became dark as he stood with the two Dragon Pulse Realm disciples. He knew Lin Yun would be a threat if he wasn’t removed, and he realized that he had underestimated him. Even if Lin Yun didn’t monopolize the Dragon Transforming Pool, the amount of divine dragon spiritual liquid he was absorbing was too unbelievable.

But it was a pity that Huang Xuanyi failed to suppress him. The Ancient Barren Battlefield would begin in less than a year. If Lin Yun continued to grow, there’s no doubt that he would become a huge threat to the Profound Sky Sect.

An hour later, Lin Yun could sense that the absorption rate of the divine dragon spiritual liquid was rapidly decreasing. When he raised his head, he could see that the golden Dragon Transforming Pool had become faint. If he continued the absorption process, the divine dragon spiritual liquid would probably disappear, and everyone else wouldn’t be able to absorb any of it.

“Let’s go down and take a look.” Lin Yun briefly pondered before deciding to go deeper into the pool. The depths of the Dragon Transforming Pool wasn’t as simple as Lin Yun had imagined. Not long after he went deeper into the pool, he could sense a blazing current, and what the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said wasn’t wrong.

As dragon runes poured out of the Blue Dragon Bone, the dragon runes appeared on his skin, and the blazing heat immediately became faint. Lin Yun didn’t dare to use the Blue Dragon Bone with the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord hanging around outside, but it was a different case after reaching the depths of the Dragon Transforming Pool.

“Is that fellow courting death?” Luo Yuan sneered, seeing Lin Yun heading towards the depths of the pool. Some swam down in the past because the divine dragon spiritual liquid was more condensed, but the dragon flames contained within the liquid was also more intense.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

So if one devoured too much, their physical body would start to collapse. At that time, they would have to leave the Dragon Transforming Pool to get rid of the dragon flames within their body.

“Let’s stop here.” Lin Yun stopped after reaching a depth of five hundred meters in the pool.

When the heavenly dragon and divine phoenix flew out from his body, Lin Yun finally gave it his all to absorb the divine dragon spiritual liquid. He crossed his legs and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. This was a rare opportunity, and Lin Yun planned to take this opportunity to reach the fourth stage in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon.

When he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, a vibrating noise echoed. The heavenly dragon and divine phoenix were swiftly revolving, turning into a terrifying vortex with an unbelievable suction force.

As countless drops of divine dragon spiritual liquid poured into his body, his cultivation swiftly reached the pinnacle nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, and the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon controlled the astral energy within his body to course through his meridians, charging at the bottleneck of the sword canon.

He would exhaust a great deal of divine dragon spiritual liquid with every attempt. If the spiritual liquid was converted to divine astral pellets, it would be an astronomical sum, and Lin Yun naturally couldn’t afford that level of exhaustion with his wealth. Still, he didn’t have that concern now.

There was a tightly shut bronze gate within his body, and his astral energy changed between a heavenly dragon and divine phoenix while charging at the bronze gate. This continued for an hour before a small gap finally appeared at the gate. As the gate rumbled, Lin Yun’s astral energy ocean started to grow, and the dragon-phoenix sword aura continued to increase.

Simultaneously, a draconic roar echoed from the gap within the bronze gate. When the dragon’s roar echoed, Lin Yun’s body began to tremble, and his soul suffered a huge impact. This puzzled him because that draconic roar was much stronger than the Blue Dragon that he had experienced before. This immediately made him think of the Heavenly Dragons, a dragon species higher than the Divine Dragons.

This made him more impressed with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, and the thought of it made him excited. If he could reach the fourth stage in the sword canon, he could try and reach the tenth star before making a breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm.

He initially planned to immediately reach the Dragon Pulse Realm after devouring the divine dragon spiritual liquid. This was because his accumulation had reached a limit, and his cultivation technique, sword intent, and martial techniques would be restricted if he didn’t choose to make a breakthrough. But he changed his mind because he might really be able to reach the tenth star with the help of the Dragon Transforming Pool and the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon!
