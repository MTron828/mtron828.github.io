“What's Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal?” Lin Yun asked.

Feng Zhang and the other core disciples were also curious because they had only heard about it and didn’t know what it was, not to mention how valuable it was.

“Liu Yuan, you explain,” said Ye Ziling.

Liu Yuan nodded when he heard that. As a deacon of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, he naturally knew about the various mines produced on the Heavenly Aquatic Island. The Heavenly Aquatic Island mainly produced agrium mines, which could be refined into agrium metal.

Although it was rare, they could still produce about 500 kilograms a year. The more agrium they had, the more saint runes that could be engraved on a saint artifact.

The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect didn’t sell their agrium, but gave it to the Sword Sect. As for the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal, it was a rare ore that was found with agrium. In fact, they could be considered a variant of agrium, but they were extremely rare.

Just 500 grams of Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal was equivalent to 5,000 kilograms of agrium, and only a few could be found every decade. Naturally, it was priceless in comparison to agrium that could be purchased with Divine Astral Pellets on the market.

On the other hand, Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal couldn’t be found on the market because saint artifacts forged with them were a lot stronger than ordinary saint artifacts. When Lin Yun listened to Liu Yuan’s explanation, he had a rough understanding of the value.

“But the azure python said it was an origin stone!” shouted Liu Yuan with a grave expression. An origin stone was the primal ore. Essentially, the origin stone could give birth to an entire mine. Generally, if the origin stone was taken from a mine, the mine wouldn’t produce anymore ore.

Likewise, if one could obtain the origin stone of the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal, they would be able to possess an entire mine of Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal after decades or centuries.

Lin Yun was speechless at the terrifying reality. Initially, they were here for Wang Yuruo to train, so he didn’t bring Lil’ Purple or Lil’ Red with him. After all, Lil’ Red was still trying to make a breakthrough into the Empyrean Realm.

Without them around, Lin Yun’s fighting prowess was much lower. Suddenly, Lin Yun’s face changed as he flicked his finger. His sword ray destroyed a towering rock, forcing an azure-clothed youth to appear. When the azure-clothed youth appeared, he wore a devilish smile on his face.

“Qin Feng!” Liu Yuan instantly recognized this person. At the same time, a few other people also soared into the sky and fled the moment Qin Feng was exposed.

“Hehe, not bad. I hid myself well, but you still found me.” The azure-clothed youth wasn’t in a hurry to leave as he smiled at Lin Yun.

“Don’t chase after him,” said Ye Ziling, stopping Feng Zhang and the other core disciples from moving.

Liu Yuan’s heart sank as he said, “This is troublesome now. It looks like those demonic cultivators already knew about the existence of the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal.”

“Qin Feng? That madman ranked tenth in the Profound Wither Sea?” Feng Zhang suddenly asked, which attracted everyone’s attention.

The Profound Wither Sea was located at the border of the Azure Profound Manor. So there were many demonic cultivators hidden in the area. Most of them had offended a terrifying existence, so they wouldn’t show themselves if they didn’t need to. Qin Feng was one of the demonic cultivators who lived in the Profound Wither Sea and wasn’t afraid to show himself. He was known as Madman Qin.

Ye Ziling took out a medal from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Shortly after, the medal began to shine and a message flew into the distance. Putting the medal away, Ye Ziling said, “I already informed the sect master about the current situation. The elders will come within seven days.”

There was no way the sect master could come personally because he was too big of a target. If the sect master came personally, it might attract even more attention. Since the elders were strong enough to deal with the demonic cultivators in the Profound Wither Sea, they would be fine. However, they would have to defend the island until the elders arrived.

“Do you want me to call the elder stationed here?” Liu Yuan asked.

“No. I’m not sure if the information is trustworthy and we only have two elders on the island. If they leave their posts and the origin stone is taken away, the entire island will be finished.” Ye Ziling was a lot calmer than Liu Yuan as she analyzed every angle of the situation.

“Is Qin Feng really that terrifying?” Feng Zhang asked.

“He was equal to Thunderclap Sword Demon when he was in the Galaxy Stage, not to mention that he had reached the Astral Stage half a year ago. His strength transformed to a much greater height now,” explained Liu Yuan.

“It’s just Qin Feng, but he’s of no concern…” Ye Ziling started to walk away, but her face turned pale and she threw up a mouthful of blood. Then, her aura started to get weak.

“Senior Sister!” Everyone exclaimed as they stepped forward to help her. But all of them were slower than Lin Yun, who was already supporting Ye Ziling.

He kept an eye on her ever since she passed through the Azure Python’s venom. After all, that poison was something that even an Elysium Core Realm expert would have to be fearful of.

“She’s poisoned.” Lin Yun said after a brief examination.

“I’m fine. We have to find the possible location of the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal’s birthplace,” said Ye Ziling after she pushed Lin Yun away.

“Indeed, you’re fine. But you can’t fight over the next seven days,” smiled Lin Yun. He didn’t choose to refute Ye Ziling because he knew that she was a strong woman. However, the moment he said those words, everyone’s hearts were instantly enveloped in shadow. They understood why Ye Ziling let Qin Feng go earlier.

“It’s not that bad.” Ye Ziling glared at Lin Yun before she took a pellet and rested briefly. Then, she led the party into the stone forest.

Lin Yun didn’t move despite the party starting their search. Seeing this, Wang Yuruo asked, “Aren’t you coming?”

“You should go first. I want to deal with the corpse first,” said Lin Yun with a wink.

Rage flashed in everyone’s eyes because Ye Ziling was poisoned and Lin Yun’s main concern was the corpse. They hadn’t even found the location of the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal’s birthplace, which made everyone feel annoyed.

“You killed this demonic beast, so you can naturally deal with it as you wish,” said Ye Ziling before she left.

Although no one believed that Lin Yun killed the Azure Python, they didn’t dare to refute Ye Ziling’s words. Once everyone was gone, Lin Yun started to examine the colossal corpse. It was so large that he wouldn’t be able to take the entire corpse. At times like this, he missed having Lil’ Red around.

Lin Yun spread his arms apart and landed on the back of the Azure Python. Then, he used his sword to cut the python, causing sparks everywhere he sliced. Ye Ziling knew that she couldn’t cut the corpse because she was injured and couldn’t use her sky sword intent. So she didn’t bother to deal with the corpse. Plus, Lin Yun was the one who wore the beast down until its last breath.

When Lin Yun swung his sword down, blood splashed and revealed the beast core. He grabbed it with a smile because Lil’ Red loved beast cores. Unfortunately, the beast core didn’t have traces of dragon bloodline, but it would still benefit Lil’ Red.

Taking a few steps forward, Lin Yun muttered to himself, “It should be somewhere around here…”

Scales flew everywhere as Lin Yun dug around. It took a while before he found the gallbladder. The gallbladder contained all the green venom of the Azure Python, which looked disgusting on his sword. Instantly, Lin Yun sealed off his pores and focused his sky sword intent to expel the venom gas.

After sword intent reached a certain height, one could cut through anything. Naturally, Lin Yun was confident in dealing with the venom. However, he wasn’t as confident as Ye Ziling was to pass through the venom and touch it.

After Lin Yun expelled the venom gas carefully, a green gallbladder appeared on the tip of his sword. With a sigh of relief, Lin Yun pulled out a jade bottle to retrieve the gallbladder. When he was done, his movements became a lot quicker as he could explore the contents of the corpse without fear of being poisoned. He quickly retrieved the rest of the valuable parts of the Azure Python.

By the time he was done, the sky had already turned dark. So, Lin Yun charged into the stone forest, “I need to catch up to everyone.”
