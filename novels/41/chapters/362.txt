Chapter 363 - One Sword

Lin Yun, who appeared out of nowhere, shocked the Demonflame Sect’s disciples. But when they saw that he only had an eighth stage cultivation, they became arrogant again. “The Sword Firmament Pavilion dares to interfere in the Demonflame Sect’s affairs?”

“If you’re tactful, you’ll get lost. Otherwise, we’ll let you taste how the Demonflame Sect tortures others. First, we’ll break all your bones and then we’ll burn you with demonic flames.” The two weaker cultivators were laughing with disdain.

The grey-clothed youth with cultivation in the ninth stage spoke out, “He’s just a disciple of the Sword Firmament Pavilion. It doesn’t matter if you kill him. Why are you guys wasting so much time talking to him?”

“Very well. I hate wasting time too.” Lin Yun unleashed his quasi-xiantian sword intent. This made the falling leaves become like sharp blades. When he drew his sword, he became like a bright moon that illuminated everything.

Lin Yun was using the Aquaselenic Sword’s Luminous Moon. Under this sword, the two disciples from the Demonflame Sect’s faces turned pale and they were killed before they could even do anything.

The grey-clothed youth was shocked and he immediately gathered his origin energy to block this sword. But he was sent flying and the origin energy that he gathered was instantly destroyed.

“Damn it…” The grey-clothed youth stood up and charged at Lin Yun. But when he took three steps forward, seven sword rays exploded from his body and he collapsed onto the ground.

Ling Yan from the same sect could survive the Luminous Moon, but that didn’t mean everyone could. Not to mention that Lin Yun was a lot stronger than he was before. When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, Feng Ye, who was hiding, was shocked.

He could also kill the three from the Demonflame Sect, but not as easily as Lin Yun. He couldn’t suppress the three of them in just one move. This also made him dispel all thoughts of fighting Lin Yun.

With a smile, Feng Ye appeared next to Lin Yun and asked, “What are you going to do with this woman?”

When Lin Yun turned around, he saw Liu Yue looking at him in shock and disbelief. He tapped his interspatial pouch and retrieved clothes for her.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun called Feng Ye along and left.

“What the hell are you pulling me for? I still haven’t gotten enough looks at her…” Feng Ye’s gaze wandered on Liu Yue.

Liu Yue grabbed onto the coat that Lin Yun threw at her. She hesitated for a long time before she called out, “Lin Yun!”

“What is it?” Lin Yun replied without even turning back.

“Thank you,” said Liu Yue. Lin Yun knew how difficult it was for her to say those words.

“It was just one sword,” Lin Yun waved his hand and continued forward.

He might have some enmity with Liu Yue in the past, but he didn’t hesitate to stand up and help her. As a man, he needed to be magnanimous.

Liu Yue was stunned when she heard Lin Yun’s words. In the end, the shame and enmity in her view was just a sword to Lin Yun. It was a pity that she still held a grudge against Lin Yun. But when she was in despair, he actually saved her life.

A few days later, Lin Yun was close to the black beam and started to encounter more people. Everyone that he passed was well guarded. None of them wished to start a conflict right before entering the Black Lotus Palace. After all, it was foolish to enter the Black Lotus Palace injured.

When Lin Yun got closer, he realized that the black beam was enveloped by a massive lake and he could only see the rough outline of the palace. Lin Yun determined that it would take at least two more days to reach the lake. Suddenly, a group of people came rushing towards Lin Yun and Feng Ye.

Lin Yun noticed that they were disciples of the Hundred Beast Gate and that they all had robust figures like Feng Ye. Feng Ye grinned upon seeing them, “The disciples of my Hundred Beast Gate are truly powerful. All of them actually survived in the Demonlotus Realm so far.”

The Demonlotus Realm was dangerous and there were already plenty of deaths every day. So it wasn’t an easy feat for everyone from the Hundred Beast Gate to stay alive.

“Senior Brother, who’s this brat?” The Hundred Beast Gate’s disciples looked at Lin Yun after they greeted Feng Ye excitedly. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

A light flickered in Feng Ye’s eyes and he smiled, “He’s a lackey that I took in recently.”

“Tsk, tsk. Senior Brother, why did you take in such a weak lackey?”

“He’s only in the eighth stage. Brat, what’s your name?” The Hundred Beast Gate’s disciples looked at Lin Yun.

When Feng Ye saw the playful smile on Lin Yun’s face, he immediately interrupted his fellow disciples and looked at Lin Yun, “You should leave quickly. Let’s hope that we don’t meet again in the Black Lotus Palace.”

He still held a grudge at Lin Yun for robbing him. But he didn’t dare to do anything when he recalled how Lin Yun killed the three disciples from the Demonflame Sect.

Lin Yun gave a deep look at Feng Ye before he left with a smile. If Feng Ye wasn’t tactful, Lin Yun would’ve started a massacre by now. Many people gathered around the Black Lotus Palace. Lin Yun thought that the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples must be gathered here as well. This would be a great opportunity for Lin Yun to group up with them.

The Black Lotus Lake was surrounded by many disciples waiting for the black beam to dissipate and all of them held back from attacking. But battles could still be seen ashore, which attracted everyone’s attention. Three disciples wearing the Primal Origin Sect’s uniform were attacking one person.

The one who was surrounded had a high attainment in his sword technique. That person was considered powerful, even in the Demonlotus Realm. But it was a pity that he was facing three others on the same level.

He was facing three core disciples from the Primal Origin Sect who were in the ninth stage. When they threw their punches, it looked like they were using an ancient war cauldron. Facing three opponents on the same level, the person was quickly placed in a disadvantageous position.

“Hehe, it’s the Primal Origin Sect and Sword Firmament Pavilion…”

“The two sects are bitter enemies. They’re fighting even when the Black Lotus Palace is about to open…”

“That swordsman seems to be the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Chen Xuanjun. I bet his Blazeyang Sword reached greater mastery a long time ago.”

“But he still can’t avoid death. After all, he’s facing three core disciples from the Primal Origin Sect.” Many people in the surroundings were enjoying the fight. After all, it was a piece of good news for them if both sides were heavily injured from the fight since they would have fewer competitors.

“Zhang Yan, Zhao Quan, and Xiao Ming. Are disciples of the Primal Origin Sect so despicable to take advantage of numbers?” Chen Xuanjun barked at them angrily.

“Haha. Chen Xuanjun, you can save the effort. Why do we have to talk about morality when it comes to the Sword Firmament Pavilion?”

“A fair fight? Chen Xuanjun, you must be dreaming.”

“Don’t blame us for being ruthless. You can only blame the Sword Firmament Pavilion for being too weak.” The three Primal Origin Sect’s disciples replied with disdain. Why should they bother fighting fairly since they could all gang up against Chen Xuanjun?

“Blazeyang Sword—Solar Brilliance!” The three core disciples from the Primal Origin Sect were only slightly weaker than Chen Xuanjun. Chan Xuanjun gathered all his origin energy into his sword and swung his sword out. This attack made his sword dazzle like the sun.

This shocked the three core disciples from the Primal Origin Sect. They never expected that Chen Xuanjun would be so powerful. But they didn’t panic and sneered as they unleashed the same attack together, the Blazecloud Fist—Burning Incineration.”

Their dracophant energy started to burn and form a cloud. When the cloud descended, it was like a sea of flames. The three of them soared into the sky and charged at Chen Xuanjun together.

Facing their attacks, fine cracks started to appear in Chen Xuanjun's sword aura. It didn’t take long for his attack to crumble and Chen Xuanjun was sent flying while throwing up a mouthful of blood. Even if the sword technique was powerful, there was no way he could face the three core disciples by himself.

The three core disciples looked at Chen Xuanjun coldly. Zhang Yan spoke out, “Chen Xuanjun, you can consider it your misfortune today. We can only come after you since Lin Yun is nowhere to be found. But you don’t have to worry about it. Your fellow disciples will soon follow you into hell.”

“Dream on!” roared Chen Xuanjun. But just when he soared into the sky, he took another punch and his ribs broke.

“Die!” Zhang Yan threw a palm with a sinister smile. But right at this moment, a sword pierced through the horizon and sent Zhang Yan flying back. The sword then plunged into the ground and released a deafening buzzing noise into the surroundings.

“What a powerful sword intent!” Not only were the three core disciples from the Primal Origin Sect shocked, but the disciples from the other sects were shocked by the sword.

They quickly raised their heads and saw a youth walking over with a sword box behind him.
