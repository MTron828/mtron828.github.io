Chapter 1405 - Saints Picking Disciples

Lin Yun smiled at Xiahou Yun. He knew what Xiahou Yun was trying to do. The Elysium Core Realm was still within the boundaries of a mortal, and they could expel any impurities through their pores. So Xiahou Yun naturally lied when he said he wanted to visit the bathroom. In reality, he wanted to run.

Xiahou Yun could be considered a genius to find such a terrible excuse. It even made Lin Yun feel bad for bullying Xiahou Yun. But even if he felt bad, Xiahou Yun still had to leave behind the Bodhi Seed, no matter what.

“Lin Yun, don’t push it!” Xiahou Yun’s face turned red. Bai Zhanli was feeling awkward while standing beside Xiahou Yun. He was trying to find a solution to this matter. They naturally couldn’t give Lin Yun the Bodhi Seed. That was something the Saint of the Xiahou Saint Clan gave Xiahou Yan, and it was the treasure of the Xiahou Saint Clan.

Even Xiahou Yan didn’t have the right to give it away because no one could bear the wrath of a saint. But it was also impossible to fight Lin Yun. Who didn’t know that Lin Yun had such a ‘good’ temper that even the princes of seven Saint Clans went down on their knees?

“How am I pushing it? According to our agreement, it’s your turn to perform the Aquaheaven Sword Technique now. So why are you running away?” Lin Yun replied.

“Since when did I say that I’m going to run? Can’t I visit the bathroom?” Xiahou Yun refuted, instantly making everyone on the plaza speechless. They didn’t expect that Xiahou Yun would sound so righteous, being so shameless, and tried to make Lin Yun look like a bad person here.

“My young master ate something wrong this morning. So is it wrong for him to visit the bathroom?”

“What’s wrong? Can’t you afford to take a loss? You’re afraid our young master will defeat you after he returns from the bathroom?”

“Wait if you have the guts.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It was humiliating, but the geniuses of the Xiahou Saint Clan could only help Xiahou Yun. When Xiahou Yun heard their words, he finally had some confidence and said, “Lin Yun, wait for half an hour. I’ll be back after half an hour.”

But when Lin Yun glanced at Xiahou Yun, it instantly made Xiahou Yun feel a chill down his spine. He replied, “Half an hour? Sure. But leave the Bodhi Seed behind. I don’t wish to repeat myself. If you don't believe me, you can hand it to the elder for safekeeping. When you return, I’ll wait for you to perform the Aquaheaven Sword Technique.”

He was already being polite with his words and had also given the Xiahou Saint Clan face. But when Xiahou Yun heard that, his face changed because he knew Lin Yun wouldn’t let him go so easily. His eyes flash with rage because the foundation of the Xiahou Saint Clan wasn’t something that the Jiang Saint Clan could be compared to. He didn’t bother acting anymore and said, “Get lost! No one can stop me from leaving!”

When Bai Zhanli saw that Xiahou Yun was about to flip the table, he quickly calmed Xiahou Yun down before looking at Lin Yun, “Flower Burial, this Bodhi Seed belongs to his big brother, Xiahou Yan. This is from the saint of the Xiahou Saint Clan, and Xiahou Yun doesn’t have the right to give it away.”

But when Lin Yun heard that, his smile disappeared, “So you’re messing with me?”

When he was done, a powerful killing intent swept out that made all the geniuses from the Bai Saint Clan and Xiahou Saint Clan feel a terrifying chill down their spines as they began to tremble from the cold. Even Xiahou Yun was terrified.

The surroundings fell into silence, and everyone was shocked when they looked at Lin Yun, wondering if Lin Yun would give all nine Saint Clans a beating.

“Hold it right there!” The grey-clothed elder glared at Lin Yun because this wasn’t the first stage. It was forbidden to fight in the second stage, and he had already clarified himself beforehand.

Lin Yun smiled, “Elder, I didn’t make a move. I just demanded something that belongs to me.”

Since when does the Bodhi Seed belong to Lin Yun? It is a treasure of the Xiahou Saint Clan. Xiahou Yun nearly threw out blood when he heard that.

But the grey-clothed elder didn’t bother with Lin Yun. He stepped forth between them and released his terrifying aura in the Samsara Edict Realm. This instantly suppressed Lin Yun’s aura and brought joy to Xiahou Yun’s face. But just when Xiahou Yun was about to speak, the grey-clothed elder said, “Everyone heard what you said earlier, including me. I’ll only ask you one question. Would you have let Lin Yun go if he lost today? Answer me if you would have let him off. I'll slay you with my sword if you dare to lie in my face!”

Lin Yun was surprised because he didn’t expect the elder to be on his side. He thought he would stand on the Xiahou Saint Clan’s side and try to brush this matter off. Simultaneously, this incident also increased Lin Yun’s favorable impression of the Sword Sect.

Facing the elder, Xiahou Yun’s forehead was covered in sweat, and his lips had become pale.

“Answer me!” The grey-clothed elder roared.

The grey-clothed elder’s roar made Xiahou Yun tremble before he replied, “I naturally wouldn’t let him go if he lost.”

Lin Yun’s eyes also became cold because Xiahou Yun was trying to go against his words. So he had to keep up his end of the bet if he lost, and Xiahou Yun didn’t have to?

“Do you know what to do now?” The grey-clothed elder asked.

Xiahou Yun nodded and could only go up to the stage and perform the Aquaheaven Sword Technique. His comprehension was outstanding, and he also had the Bodhi Seed. So he managed to successfully complete all twelve forms.

“It’s no wonder why he dares to bet with Lin Yun. So he has mastered all twelve forms.”

“His talent is also heaven-defying since he can master twelve forms in just two days.”

“His comprehension is just equivalent to Ye Ziling, in my view. The heaven-defying thing is the Bodhi Seed.”

“That’s right. Luckily it was Lin Yun that he bet with, or he would fool others.” Murmurs resounded as everyone looked at Lin Yun with reverence in their eyes.

After all, Lin Yun fully mastered the Aquaheaven Sword Technique and could summon the holy spirit.

“The Bodhi Seed is yours. But something that belongs to the Xiahou Saint Clan isn’t easy to take!” Xiahou Yun couldn’t change anything with the Sword Sect’s elder on Lin Yun’s side. He couldn't change anything, even if he wanted to go against his words.

When Lin Yun received the Bodhi Seed, he was surprised by its weight since it weighed a thousand cauldrons. This was simply too unbelievable, and it felt like he was holding onto a saint artifact.

“This is a treasure, so keep it well. Aside from enhancing your comprehension, it can also fend you from the heart demon. Once you refine it completely, it can even fend off all demonic arts, so much so that you’ll be immune to all poison.” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the sword box in excitement. But since Lil’ Purple put it that way, the Bodhi Seed was a treasure.

When Xiahou Yun left, Bai Zhanli left with him. Before he left, he glanced at Lin Yun, who didn’t even give any face to Xiahou Yan.

Keeping the Bodhi Seed in the interspatial bracelet that Liu Anyan gave him, Lin Yun turned to the grey-clothed elder, “Senior, thank you for helping earlier.”

“It has been 300 years since the white dragon was last seen.” The grey-clothed elder smiled. “It has been 300 years since anyone could summon the holy spirit of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique.”

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that no one could summon the holy spirit of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique in the past 300 years. The sword technique was hard, but it wasn’t a ghost spirit martial technique. It was roughly comparable to the Heaven Sword Form.

“Look over there. All the Peak Lords are watching, so who would dare to bully you?” The grey-clothed elder smiled before pointing his hand in a direction.

When Lin Yun turned around, he could see several saints standing above the clouds and sensed their gazes on him.

“You’re first on the second stage since you summoned the holy spirit. But you have to wait till the test ends to obtain the high-grade saint pellet,” smiled the grey-clothed elder.

“Yeah, that’s fine.” Lin Yun nodded. The test for the second stage lasted for a long time, and it only came to an end the following day. As for the second stage, Lin Yun was first, Ye Ziling was third, Zhao Yan was fifth, and even Gongsun Yan made it into the top ten. This meant that they had a huge harvest in the second stage.

“Seven days from now, you must be prepared for the third stage. This stage is the most important part of the test!” The grey-clothed elder gave the high-grade saint pellet to Lin Yun.

This made Lin Yun curious about the third stage because the grey-clothed elder wasn’t the first person who said that. In terms of results, everyone had performed pretty well, and they all incited Lin Yun to treat them to a meal when the second stage ended.

Lin Yun didn’t refuse them and considered it to be a celebratory meal. So he treated everyone at the Hundred Aquatic Pavilion in the Azureblack City. The Hundred Aquatic Pavilion was one of the best inns in the city, but it wasn’t an issue for Lin Yun to buy them a meal with his current wealth.

In the room, Zhao Yan asked, “The third stage is where the game begins.”

“What do you mean?” Gongsun Yan asked. Zhao Yan came from a Saint Clan, so he naturally knew more than them.

“Saints picking disciples,” said Zhao Yan.

Everyone’s faces changed, and their breathing became heavy when they heard that. Gongsun Yan asked, “Are you sure about that? Although there are rumors, the Sword Sect didn’t verify it.”

This was huge because even Zhao Yan rarely received guidance from the saint in his clan, even if he came from a Saint Clan. Even meeting with the saint was hard, not to mention any guidance.

Saints were transcendent existences and rarely had time to teach others. Not to mention that most saints wouldn’t even have such thoughts. But it was different from being taken in as a disciple by a saint.

“I heard that the Sword Sect even visited some geniuses of some Ancient Saint Clans, and those geniuses will show up seven days from now,” said Zhao Yan mysteriously.

Ye Ziling’s face changed when she heard that. Even Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because the Radiant Snow Saint Clan that Ye Ziling belonged to was an Ancient Saint Clan. So did that mean the Ye Saint Clan would send someone over?
