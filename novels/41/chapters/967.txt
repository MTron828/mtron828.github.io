Chapter 968 - Sudden Meeting

The spectators were silent after witnessing the eradication of the Azure Rainbow Realm. It only took a split second, but the shock was great.

It was already shocking enough that Lin Yun was able to chase six higher realms away with a few words. However, his personal attack was even more terrifying. Although there was no way Shi Ming’s strength could compare to the likes of Liu Mu, he was still the leader of a higher realm. But even he couldn’t resist Lin Yun’s strength.

Based on Lin Yun’s current strength, he was at the same level of the other owners of the astral spirits. His astronomical rise was unbelievable.

After dealing with Shi Ming, Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu. He felt relieved after examining their injuries. Shi Ming might be good at torturing others, but he didn’t cause them permanent harm. However, the wounds were still terrifying, so they wouldn’t be able to compete for the inheritance in the astral palace.

Tapping his interspatial pouch, Lin Yun retrieved three bottles of dragon clan wine and handed them over. Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu immediately downed the bottles. In the next second, their injuries recovered while their origin energy grew by 20-30%.

Their boundless aura exploded, manifesting into purple mist full of vitality. The spectators were so shocked that they wanted to know what was in the bottles.

“What kind of wine is this?” Zhu Qingshan asked in disbelief.

“Dragon clan wine,” smiled Lin Yun before pointing at Lil’ Red. “It was gathered by this fool. I have a lot, so don’t worry.”

Lil’ Red grinned, clearly treating Lin Yun’s words as praise. But when Lin Yun mentioned the dragon clan wine, no one could believe their ears. After all, dragon clan wine was an ancient wine that was comparable to saint pellets. Lin Yun emptied an entire cellar of dragon clan wine?

After Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu recovered a little, they looked at Lin Yun and sighed, “We’ve been separated for five months and now we can’t even see you. You’re like a dragon returning to the ocean after arriving in the Heavenly Path.”

“I’m just lucky. With the right opportunity, you guys can do the same.” Lin Yun smiled. Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu should have no further issues if they didn’t run into geniuses from the higher realms.

“It’s all thanks to the fortune martial techniques you gave us. Otherwise, we might not even be able to obtain the tribulation qualification,” smiled Zhu Qingshan. “Do you want to look for the Cloud Soul Sect’s inheritance with us?”

The three of them looked at Lin Yun with anticipation. If Lin Yun joined them, no one would be able to compete with them on the Cloud Soul Sect’s inheritances. Then, they would be able to rise and confront the higher realms. If they were lucky enough, they might even obtain the strength to suppress higher realms’ leaders like Shi Ming.

Lin Yun looked at the towering palace. It had a complete inheritance, so he knew he would find something worthwhile if he went in. However, there was no way it could compare to the constellation palaces. Retracting his gaze, Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Red and smiled, “I can’t, but this little fool will go with you. It’s an expert in scouring treasures.”

Lin Yu knew it wouldn’t be easy for Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu to find anything good with their strength. But if Lil’ Red went with them, they could obtain most of the Cloud Soul Sect’s treasures.

As friends who came from the Profound Amber Realm, he had a bond with them, especially Zhu Qingshan who used to be called Zuo Yun. So Lin Yun naturally hoped that his friends could find opportunities in the Heavenly Path.

Lil’ Red was a lot faster than Lin Yun, so he knew that Lil’ Red could catch up to him later. Plus, he wouldn’t have to worry about not having any helpers after reaching the constellation palace.

Four hours later, the starlight enveloping the sect weakened to the point that everyone could enter. Seeing this scene, Lin Yun urged Lil’ Red, “Be quick.”

Lil’ Red turned into a streak of light and easily tore apart the remaining starlight barrier with its claws. This scene left Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu shocked because they knew that Lin Yun was helping them by lending Lil’ Red. At the same time, the crowd also flew towards the peak of the mountain. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Go ahead.” Lin Yun waved to Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Chen, and Fang Shaoyu. They nodded their heads before following the crowd into the barrier.

Looking at the majestic appearance of the inheritance opening, Lin Yun squinted his eyes. Although it was brilliant, it was nothing compared to the constellation palaces. In the future, it wouldn’t be surprising if he ran into the seven heads.

Lin Yun knew that it wouldn’t be easy, but he was excited. After all, he came to the Heavenly Path to defeat stronger enemies. When he squinted his eyes, a sharp light flashed through his pupils.

“Hehe, you’ve actually become so strong in just two months. How shocking.” Lin Yun heard a charming voice just as he was about to turn around. The voice could only belong to the mysterious woman he faced outside of Flamefeather City.

Who would have thought that he would run into her again in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. Purple light intertwined like a waterfall as the mysterious woman slowly appeared. She had the same seductive figure as before with a pair of bewitching eyes under her veil.

“You must be joking.” Lin Yun smiled awkwardly at the mysterious woman. After all, he and Lil’ Red made the mysterious woman suffer a small loss. She came at a peculiar time because Lil’ Red wasn’t around.

“I’m not joking. Not many men can catch my attention.” Pei Xue threw a charming glance at Lin Yun.

I better not look at her eyes. It seems like she has some kind of conflict with Yue Weiwei, but I can’t sense any hostility from her. Although he didn’t feel like he was in danger, he wasn’t confident that he could beat Pei Xue. Then again, Lin Yun might have a shot if he used all of his trump cards. After all, now he had the sky sword intent.

“Ice beauty, stop teasing someone from our Azure Dragon Region. None of the men who caught your attention had a good outcome…” Three figures flew over, emitting powerful auras that shocked Lin Yun. He felt slightly threatened by them.

“Luo Chen!” The youth who spoke earlier smiled at Lin Yun with a simple introduction.

Although Lin Yun had no change on his face, he was shocked by the name. After all, not a single person didn’t know of Luo Chen. Luo Chen was ranked first on the Azure Dragon Ranking and his name shined brightly on the Heavenly Path Mirror. Luo Chen already had the qualification to compete at the end of the Heavenly Path.

“Meng Junchen!”

“Qin Lin!” The other two also nodded at Lin Yun and revealed their names. Both of them were also part of the seven heads and were just as famous as Luo Chen.

“Greetings. I’ve heard your names many times.” Lin Yun smiled. “Looks like you guys have been observing me for some time now. The seven heads on the Azure Dragon Ranking truly deserve their reputation.”

There was naturally nothing to say about their strength since they had been observing him for so long without him noticing. Then again, he could tell that they didn’t have any hostility with him or else his sky sword intent would have sensed it.

“Haha. Our names haven’t been as famous as yours lately. You’re Flower Burial Lin Yun. Who hasn’t heard of you in the Azure Dragon Region?” Luo Chen smiled. “You don’t have to be so humble. We wouldn’t have come here if you weren't strong enough. Plus, you wouldn’t have caught the attention of the ice beauty if you weren’t so strong.”

Pei Xue simply rolled her eyes, but she neither agreed or disagreed. Lin Yun was stunned because these people who stood at the top of the pyramid in the Azure Dragon Ranking were taking the initiative to befriend him. It was surprising, but he couldn’t help but wonder if they had a hidden objective.
