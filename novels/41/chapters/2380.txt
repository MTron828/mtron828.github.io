Chapter 2381 - Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal

On the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain’s stage, Lin Yun briefly chatted with them before they found a mountain each. When Lin Yun and Lin Jiangxian were the only ones left, Lin Yun called out to Lin Jiangxian. He asked, “Speaking of which, is that friend of your master reliable?”

“It looks like you’re not as composed as you look. You’re afraid that Ji Zixi will be worried?” Lin Jiangxian smiled.

Lin Yun nodded, “This is my choice, and I have already considered the consequences. I have fulfilled my promise to her father by sending her to the banquet, but she’s still young. She will blame herself if I can’t return to the Kunlun Realm.”

Lin Jiangxian briefly pondered, then said, “Don’t belittle her. She’s stronger than she looks. Believe me.”

Lin Yun raised his head, and he calmed down after seeing Lin Jiangxian’s facial expression.

“That person owes my master a huge favor. If my master is the one asking, I believe that he will return the favor,” Lin Jiangxian said.

Lin Yun wanted to say something upon hearing that, but he was interrupted by Lin Jiangxian. She said, “It’s okay.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lin Yun was briefly stunned, before he smiled, “You already know what I wanted to ask before I even asked it?”

“You want to ask if I can get my master to do that? I can,” Lin Jiangxian said.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he looked more relieved.

“Let’s try and get help from the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity. If you can catch his attention, your strength will be greatly boosted,” Lin Jiangxian said. “Regarding returning to the Kunlun Realm, you don’t have to worry about that.”

Lin Yun’s concerns were swept away, and he smiled, “My biggest harvest in the Heavenly Barren Realm is knowing you.”

Lin Jiangxian was briefly stunned, before she replied, “Me too.”

“We’ll meet again at the Heavenly Barren Banquet.”

“Yeah.” The two agreed before they flew to the nearby mountains.

As Lin Yun flew, he felt like he had entered an ocean of saint aura, and noticed that the surrounding mountains all had a saint vein. He picked a mountain, and muttered, “Let’s go with this one.”

This mountain was massive. When Lin Yun landed on it, there was a desolate platform with old buildings, making it look like it had been a long time since someone had been there. He smiled, “This is a good place.”

When he landed, he noticed that the surrounding saint aura was dense. He then took out the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet, “Let’s refine it.”

This was a treasure, and it would even attract the attention of Emperor Realm experts if it appeared in the Kunlun Realm.

“According to what Profound Sky Venerable said, the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet can help me reforge the Azure Dragon Divine Physique into the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique, passing eight Dragon Tribulations,” Lin Yun muttered.

The Azure Dragon Divine Physique was required to undergo nine tribulations to possess the perfect Divine Dragon Physique, and the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet can help him get past eight. This meant that he only had to face the last Dragon Tribulation!

“This is too precious,” Lin Yun muttered as he took a deep breath before the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet flew into his mouth and a golden radiance shone from his pores. He also began to form the seal according to what Profound Sky Venerable taught him.

As Lin Yun began to form the seal, the Azure Dragon Constellation opened its eyes and gazed upon him. A dragon’s claw tore apart the sky as a massive dragon appeared around Lin Yun. When the Sovereign Constellation descended, the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet calmed down.

“Is it starting?” Profound Sky Venerable muttered on the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. “Let’s hope that it will be smooth.”

The Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet couldn’t allow someone to possess a perfect Divine Dragon Physique. The test of will alone was enough to eliminate ninety percent of the cultivators.

While Lin Yun was refining the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet, he didn’t know that there was an undercurrent taking place in the outside world.

The first was the Dao Sect. When the seal from Qin Yun returned, the lamp representing Qin Yun was extinguished in the Elder Hall. When the lamp shattered, all the elders here were dumbfounded.

“Qin Yun is dead!”

“How is that possible? Who dares to kill the chief disciple of my Dao Sect?!”

“He went to the Heavenly Barren Realm!” The elders became nervous, and a roar echoed from the saint mountain, shocking the entire Dao Sect. The voice came from the Dao Sect’s sect master, and he was enraged.

He understood what happened when the seal returned, and he roared with murderous intent sweeping out, causing the entire Dao Sect to tremble in fear.

“Lin Yun? Who’s that? A mere ant from the Kunlun Realm dares to kill my Dao Sect’s chief disciple? He thinks he’s safe at Heaven’s Gate?!”

Similar scenes occurred in the Shadow Divine Palace, Heavenly Sword Pavilion, Tuoba Hong’s tribe, and various Divine Clans. They were all gritting their teeth.

“Lin Yun? He has to die no matter what!”

“That brat from the Kunlun Realm is too arrogant!”

After all, the death of so many immortal holy lands’ chief disciples and Divine Clans’ geniuses caused an uproar in the three thousand realms. But it was mainly because Qin Yun, Heavenly Book, and Jiang Ziyao held great weight or had vast backgrounds.

Compared to the Dao Sect, Heavenly Sword Pavilion, and Shadow Divine Palace, the Divine Clans’ geniuses that Lin Yun crippled were nothing in comparison. But Lin Yun had no idea about that as he cultivated on Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain.

Half a month later, Lin Yun successfully refined the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet, and his Azure Dragon Divine Physique began transforming into the Divine Dragon Physique. The Azure Dragon Divine Rune in his heart also increased from one to ten.

“Let’s test the Divine Dragon Physique...” Lin Yun opened his eyes, and his Dragon’s Blood began to boil within his body. His body swelled the next moment and a golden Divine Dragon Seal appeared on his forehead. He grew to two meters with the Azure Saint Cloth bursting apart, revealing his topless body. His muscles looked as though they were carved, and golden dragon runes had become intertwined, forming into a dragon-shaped tattoo.

“This is the Divine Dragon Physique?” Lin Yun couldn’t conceal his shock, and he could feel that he was like a volcano. It was unimaginable that a Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet made his physique reach the same level as those who became a saint through their physiques.

Before he could sense the Divine Dragon Physique more clearly, golden clouds appeared in the sky, with lightning accumulating within. In the next second, Lin Yun felt an extremely dangerous aura upon the Dragon Tribulation’s arrival.

“If you can make it through the tribulation, you will possess the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique. If you fail, it will only stay at a Divine Dragon Physique. Your body-refining path will also end,” Profound Sky Venerable’s voice resounded in Lin Yun’s ears.

Lin Yun’s face became grave. The Divine Dragon Physique was strong, but he didn’t want to stop and became nervous. But he had more excitement flashing in his eyes instead.

“That fellow is a madman,” Profound Sky Venerable was speechless when he saw the excitement in Lin Yun’s eyes.

When the golden lightning descended, it would tear Lin Yun’s body apart, revealing his bones.

Right then, Ji Zixi, Xiong Tiannan, Ao Jue, and Lin Jiangxian landed on the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, looking at the golden lightning that was descending on Lin Yun.

“Holy shit, isn’t this too unbelievable?” Xiong Tiannan said. “Lin Yun didn’t suffer such injuries even when fighting with others.”

“Venerable, what’s wrong with Big Brother Lin?” Ji Zixi asked. She could sense vitality flowing in that direction. Not only Lin Yun’s vitality but also the saint mountain.

Profound Sky Venerable wasn’t as composed as before, and said with a grave expression, “I didn’t expect this Dragon Tribulation to be so powerful. This is the Dragon Tribulation from the Azure Dragon Constellation itself. That fellow seems to have caught the attention of the Sovereign Constellation.”

“There are many things you never thought of. You thought he had refined the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet earlier,” Lin Jiangxian said.

The corner of Profound Sky Venerable’s lips twitched, before he said, “I didn’t know back then. The Azure Dragon Constellation seemed to be fond of him. What did he do? Wasn’t he in the Kunlun Realm?”

“Big Brother Lin possessed a Sovereign Saint Artifact before, the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, and he used it multiple times before he became a Saint,” Ji Zixi said.

Profound Sky Venerable took a deep breath and said, “Holy shit. He dared to use a Sovereign Saint Artifact before he became a Saint?”

“What should we do now?” Ji Zixi asked nervously.

Even Profound Sky Venerable had panicked at this moment, but he soon calmed down. He said, “It’s fine as long as he gives up. Even if he gave up, he will still possess the Divine Dragon Physique, and he will only be stronger than he was before.”

“It’s hard to make him give up,” Lin Jiangxian said.

A dragon’s roar echoed on the mountain as Lin Yun struggled to stand up and fearlessly looked at the golden vortex of lightning.

The Dragon Tribulation was something that no one had expected, and it lasted for seven days. The mountain that Lin Yun was on was almost destroyed, and one could only imagine how powerful the Dragon Tribulation was.

Three days later, the last Dragon Tribulation descended, and the saint mountain collapsed.

“Let’s go and take a look!” Profound Sky Venerable couldn’t hold back and rushed over with everyone else following behind him.

When they were a few kilometers away, they couldn’t approach any longer because the ruin was enveloped in a powerful dragon aura that even stopped Profound Sky Venerable from approaching.

When the cloud of dust settled down, everyone’s faces changed when they saw Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was kneeling on one knee as a dragon’s claw stretched through space, carving something on Lin Yun’s forehead.

The carving was bloody, but Profound Sky Venerable was shocked when he saw this. He muttered, “That’s the Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal!”
