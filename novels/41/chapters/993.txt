Chapter 994 - Azure Dragon True Bone

Many people knew that there was an opportunity above fortune in the Azure Dragon Palace. But no one dared to confirm it without witnessing it for themselves. After all, not even Luo Chen managed to obtain it after making it through the test.

But now, the Azure Dragon Lord was giving the opportunity to Lin Yun. The normally composed Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling excited. It took a long time for him to calm down. Once Lin Yun was ready, Jiang Ling opened his hand and a box appeared in his palm.

As Lin Yun looked, the box opened and a black bone appeared. The center of the bone was engraved with a purple golden natural rune made Lin Yun cautious. Lin Yun had come in contact with divine runes before, but there was something unusual about this rune. At the same time, an ancient domineering dragon aura flew out from the bone that emitted the violent aura of an emperor.

“A dragon bone?” Lin Yun exclaimed when he saw this scene. It was a genuine dragon rune, which was different from bones of demonic beasts who possessed dragon bloodline. It was a genuine bone left behind by a true dragon. The value was unimaginable, not to mention that it was engraved with a natural rune. Basically, Lin Yun needed to comprehend it briefly to become a peerless powerhouse in the future.

“More accurately speaking, it’s called the Azure Dragon True Bone. It’s a true bone left behind by an Azure Dragon King. This bone is different from the other remains because this bone is still alive. It can produce azure dragon blood essence to nourish and reforge the body,” said Jiang Ling.

When Lin Yun heard that, he began to wonder if this was the opportunity above fortune. Just thinking about it had made his heart start throbbing violently. Refine it into a dao artifact? Or refine into an elixir? Or comprehend the divine rune in it?

All sorts of thoughts flashed through Lin Yun’s mind because no matter which it was, it would bring him great benefit. If it was refined into a dao artifact, it could just merge with his Indigoflame Thunderwhip, allowing it to break through the shackles of a dao artifact. If it was refined into an elixir, it could boost his cultivation after absorbing it.

As for the natural rune, there was nothing to say about it since it was a complete divine rune. As a third grade spiritualist, he knew how terrifying it would be if he could grasp a complete divine rune, especially since it was a naturally formed divine rune owned by the Azure Dragon King. There was no question that the power in the rune could compete with the Azure Dragon King itself.

“You’re fortunate because you’ve cultivated the Azure Dragon Battle Physique. Otherwise, it wouldn't be easy for you to merge with this bone. It looks like you’re the person I’ve been waiting for,” smiled Jing Ling.

When Lin Yun heard that, he nodded his head without thinking. But when he realized what Jiang Ling said, his face changed, “Merge with this bone?!”

“That’s right.” Jiang Ling nodded his head. “You’ll be able to rise in Kunlun Realm after merging with this dragon rune. Then, you’ll be able to compete with those heaven-defying geniuses.”

Lin Yun had thought of many ways to use this bone, but never imagined that Jiang Ling would want him to merge with it.

“The opportunity above fortune lies in it, and it’ll depend on you to see how much you can comprehend.” Jiang Ling’s face became grave as he pulled Lin Yun in. The power was so great that there was no way Lin Yun could resist. With the bone emitting a dazzling brilliance, Jiang Ling stabbed the bone into Lin Yun’s chest. “Bear with the pain. You’re currently merging with the bone and the pain will far exceed your imagination.”

“Argghhh!” Lin Yun yelled out in pain because he could feel his chest being torn apart. The wound was so sinister that Lin Yun’s beating heart could be seen.

When the dragon bone entered Lin Yun’s chest, it began to melt and slowly fuse with his ribs. Every time the bone merged an inch, his ribs would shatter into pieces.

The pain even drilled into Lin Yun’s soul. The pain was an unprecedented torture to Lin Yun. In fact, it was 100 times worse than the pain he felt in the black ocean. At the same time, the dragon runes on the surface of his body began to squirm as they poured towards the dragon bone.

Then, violent energy began to spread throughout Lin Yun’s internal organs and limbs. Even under Jiang Ling’s control, the violent energy charged around in his body. As the pain spread throughout his body, Lin Yun nearly fainted.

As the merging speed increased, terrifying lightning began to shine out of Lin Yun’s pores. Jiang Ling also loosened his grip on the dragon bone and took a step back. As the violent energy surged within Lin Yun’s body, his body floated in the air with lightning exploding everywhere. Lin Yun’s hair fluttered from the violent wind and his face was still full of pain.

As the wound on his chest healed, boundless vitality rumbled within his body. Furthermore, with the vague lightning enveloping his body, Lin Yun’s azure dragon aura rose rapidly.

Lin Yun could sense boundless information flowing into his mind from the Azure Dragon True Bone. In the end, ancient words began to appear in his mind manifested from the ocean of lightning, Azure Dragon Saint Art.

Those four words emitted a powerful pressure, which caused Lin Yun to release a ferocious dragon roar. He continued to get ripped to shreds by the lightning as his body swiftly regenerated. Anyone could tell that Lin Yun was experiencing unimaginable pain. It even made Jiang Ling a little worried.

After all, Lin Yun was barely merging with the bone left behind by an Azure Dragon King. If he wasn’t careful, the violent energy would destroy his body. If Lin Yun didn’t cultivate the Azure Dragon Battle Physique, he would have had to reach the Empyrean Realm. However, even the Empyrean Realm would barely be enough.

Jiang Ling knew that this was a dangerous method, but he didn’t have any other choices. He had been waiting for a successor for a long time. Even though many people appeared, not a single person was able to pass his test. Now that he met someone who fit his criteria, he decided to take the risk.

Roughly half a day later, nine newly forged dragon runes appeared on the surface of Lin Yun’s body. The dragon runes were different from before as they gave off an aura no weaker than a dao artifact. They also contained an emperor aura.

In fact, they didn’t look like nine dragon runes, but nine actual dragons. At this moment, Jiang Ling knew that Lin Yun had succeeded.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun fell from the sky and landed on one knee. His presence was like an ancient ferocious beast. When Lin Yun slowly opened his eyes, he started examining himself. With a clenched fist, he could sense an immense power pouring out of the Azure Dragon True Bone in his chest.

“This…” Lin Yun was completely shocked by his current strength. He could sense that he was a lot stronger than before and it wasn’t limited to just his physique. He could sense that his origin energy now contained a wisp of the azure dragon’s aura. It seemed like the Azure Dragon Saint Art was similar to the Azure Dragon Battle Physique.

The major difference was that the Azure Dragon Saint Art wasn’t limited to just strengthening his physique. Based on the information he obtained from the dragon bone, he knew that his physique could be comparable to a saint dragon upon cultivating the Azure Dragon Saint Art to the limit. He might even be able to surpass that limit.

After all, the dragon bone didn’t come from an ordinary azure dragon but the king. At this moment, Lin Yun was only at the beginning. As for the nine dragon runes, they could be called saint runes because they were a lot stronger than the dragon runes he had before.

“This is the opportunity above fortune in the Azure Dragon Palace,” smiled Jiang Ling.

Then, Lin Yun suddenly thought of something and smiled, “Senior, since you’ve already given me the opportunity above fortune, why don’t you give me something more? What about that Azure Dragon Grab?”

Lin Yun knew that the reason why he was able to take that attack head-on was thanks to this sky sword intent. If he didn’t have the sky sword intent, he wasn’t confident that he could make it through the test. So he was interested in the powerful attack.

Jiang Ling was stunned before he started laughing, “I can teach it to you if you want to learn it. But keep in mind that it was nothing because I didn’t use my full strength. Otherwise, there’s no way you could have broken it even with your sky sword intent.”
