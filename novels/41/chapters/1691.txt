Chapter 1692 – Teachings

“Let’s go take a look at the Saint Altar…” Lin Yun stowed the Heavenly Fragrance Medal and left his residence. He wanted to see why Mu Xueling summoned them.

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion still looked like a celestial realm as before. Along the way, Lin Yun encountered many of Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples, all discussing him.

“Is that him?”

“That’s right. He’s Lin Xiao. He beat Elder Jiang Yu on his first day and even teased Saint Elder.”

“Are you serious? He even dared to tease Saint Elder?”

“What do you think? How can he be so bold otherwise? He didn’t hesitate to strip and was buck naked.”

“Holy shit! Isn’t that a little too outrageous? I don’t believe it!”

“Haha. Thousands of people have witnessed it, and I heard from a senior brother that all the martial sisters were stumped on the spot.”

Lin Yun was stunned when he heard the surrounding discussions. What did they mean by he was buck-naked? He only pulled his upper clothes apart, and the rumors were getting out of hand. Raising his head to glare at the person that spoke, that person was terrified by his gaze just when he wanted to explain.

That person quickly turned to the person standing beside him, “Quick, let’s leave immediately. That fellow probably wanted to make a move again.”

Before Lin Yun could take another step, everyone in the surrounding area had dispersed. This made Lin Yun’s lip twitch, and his face was ugly because he knew he couldn’t clear up his name now. If Lil’ Purple knew about this, she would probably laugh at him for the rest of his life.

Lin Yun had no choice but to lower his head and quicken his footsteps. When he arrived at the Saint Altar, many people were already seated on the mats on the ground. For some reason, the Saint Altar had become much quieter than before, and everyone had to show their Heavenly Fragrance Medal if they wanted to enter.

Casually looking around, Lin Yun discovered that he had come early, and most of the mats were empty. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi.

“Young Master Lin, come over and sit down.” Lin Wan was very passionate, waving her hand at Lin Yun.

Nodding his head, Lin Yun walked over. When he went over, he asked, “Why are you guys here?”

They came with him to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, so they shouldn’t have the time to take the tests. But with Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi’s strengths, there was a high chance that they could make it through the first nine tests, especially Lin Wan, the chief disciple of the Heavenly Note Sect. Her accomplishment in music dao probably wasn’t weaker than any disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

“Hehe, we have this.” Lin Wan said and took out a Heavenly Fragrance Medal.

“Her Highness, the Profound Fairy gave it to us.” Luo Shuyi smiled.

“That also works?” Lin Yun was surprised. “This person is really formidable, then.”

“Still alright. Just because one has the Heavenly Fragrance Medal doesn’t mean that they are qualified to partake in the Nirvana Banquet. But many benefits come with the Heavenly Fragrance Medal. You can listen to the teachings of Saint Elder, and you can also enter various forbidden grounds in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.” Luo Shuyi explained.

“You’re famous now. Over twenty thousand disciples in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion know about your name.” Lin Wan gave Lin Yun a wink.

Looking at her expression, Lin Yun instantly knew about the rumors revolving around him.

“They’re all rumors.” Lin Yun awkwardly smiled.

“Hahaha!” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi laughed when they saw Lin Yun’s gaze. As Lin Wan rolled her eyes, she smiled, “That’s uncertain. After all, no one knows what you’ll do if there aren’t so many people in the surroundings.”

While the three of them were chatting, a terrifying chill swept out, and Lin Yun could sense a sharp gaze directed at him.

“Oh? Isn’t this the famous Flower Burial?” A piercing voice sounded. When Lin Yun turned around, he saw a youth dressed in blue looking at him coldly. This person could be considered handsome and shared an uncanny resemblance with Jiang Yu. His cultivation at the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm made him stand out amongst the crowd. When he arrived, many people greeted him.

“That’s Elder Jiang Yu’s son, Jiang Feng. He’s an inner disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, and he’s very strong.” Lin Wan said.

“You probably got the wrong person. There’s no Flower Burial here.” Lin Yun replied as he dropped his smile.

“Oh? Didn’t you say that you were Flower Burial yesterday? Why did you cower now?” Jiang Feng coldly looked at Lin Yun.

“What has it got to do with you?” Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with Jiang Feng. He didn’t even fear Jiang Yu, not to mention Jiang Feng.

“Lin Xiao, don’t stoop to his level. Saint Elder will be here soon.” Lin Wan pulled Lin Yun’s hand. She didn’t want to see him starting a conflict with Jiang Feng now because the current location wasn’t suitable.

But Jiang Feng coldly glared at him, “Lin Wan, why are you trying to protect this Lin Xiao? Don’t tell me that you have a relationship with him. Otherwise, why would you recommend a barbarian like him to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion?”

Lin Wan’s face sank when she heard that, and her face became cold. She snickered, “So what has it got to do with you, even if I fell for a barbarian? You’re inferior to a barbarian, a joke like your father.”

She wasn’t someone who would quietly take a loss, and she refuted Jiang Feng.

“Get lost. Don’t think I don’t dare to deal with you just because you have a good relationship with the Profound Fairy!” Jiang Feng’s face was cold, and he was determined to teach Lin Yun a lesson today. Anyone who dared to stand in his way would be his enemy.

He pushed his palm forth without hesitation, and this palm was ferocious as he poured his entire fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm cultivation into it. This attack was abrupt and wasn’t something that Lin Wan could withstand.

When his palm was about to land on Lin Wan, Lin Yun suddenly stood up and grabbed Jiang Feng’s wrist. When he poured his dragon runes into his wrist, a dragon roar echoed from within his body and a violent wind rose in the Saint Altar.

This scene shocked everyone, including Jiang Feng, because Lin Yun was too fast. He struggled a little but couldn’t move his hand, no matter what.

“You’re really ruthless!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a cold light as he clenched Jiang Feng’s wrist. Killing intent even started to brew within his pupils.

This scene left everyone in the surroundings shocked as they looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. Lin Yun had just given Jiang Yu a beating, and he wanted to give his son a beating? Wasn’t he a little too ruthless? Even without using his music dao, Jiang Feng was at the pinnacle of the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and he wouldn’t seal his cultivation like Jiang Yu.

Jiang Feng’s face became cold, and he eerily smiled, “I haven’t dealt with you yet, and yet you jumped out on your own? Good! Let me teach a barbarian like you about the rules!”

When he finished, his dragon origin surged out, and he grabbed Lin Yun’s wrist with a flip. As a collision between dragon origin and pure strength unfolded, a terrifying wave swept out, and the Saint Altar started to tremble.

As the two confronted, they both unleashed terrifying auras. Lin Yun had circulated the Blue Dragon Skybrekaing Art, pouring a hundred thousand dragon runes into his hand. Even with their cultivation differences, Lin Yun wasn’t afraid to rely on pure strength.

This made Jiang Feng’s face change. He initially wanted to suppress Lin Yun using his cultivation, but he never expected that Lin Yun would be so hard to deal with. At this moment, he realized that he was careless.

“Stop!” A cold voice resounded just when Jiang Feng wanted to summon his constellation. A terrifying aura also swept out that instantly enveloped the entire Saint Altar, which was an aura of a Quasi-Saint.

The one who spoke out was naturally the Saint Elder of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, Mu Xueling. When everyone raised their heads, they quickly bowed, “Greetings, Saint Elder.”

Mu Xueling looked at the two still competing and pushed out a palm, forcibly separating them. Jiang Feng took several steps back before he managed to stabilize himself. On the other hand, Lin Yun merely made a spin before he stabilized himself. When he looked at Mu Xueling, his pupils flashed with fear.

She came at the right time, and he knew there was no chance for him to deal with Jiang Feng now.

“Lin Xiao, you really have a big temper, wanting to make a move against a Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciple when you had just arrived. You really don’t place me in your eyes, do you?” Mu Xueling turned to look at Lin Yun.

The chill in Lin Yun’s pupils gradually receded, and he smiled, “Saint Elder, you must be joking. How will I dare not to put you in my eyes? If you’re slightly later, I might already be killed by this person with the surname Jiang.”

Despite the unhappiness in his heart, Jiang Feng didn’t dare to be disrespectful in front of the Saint Elder. He smiled, “Brother Lin, you’re too serious. We just had a friendly spar. Why would I dare to kill you in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion even if you give me ten more guts?”

“Haha.” Lin Yun smiled, and his pupils were filled with mockery. There was no fear in his eyes for Jiang Feng.

With that, this turbulence had settled down. When everyone arrived, Mu Xueling said, “All of you will partake in the final test fifteen days from now to compete for the five quotas. I will be teaching you every day for the next fifteen days, but it will depend on your talent to see how much you can improve.”

“Thank you, Saint Elder.” Everyone cupped their hands together. Everyone, including Lin Yun, would naturally listen if she was willing to teach. After all, Mu Xueling was a Quasi-Saint who grasped the Imperial Tone.

“In music dao, aside from practicing the tone, you guys still have to cultivate your mental energy. If you compare it with martial dao, the different stages, like Noble and Saint Tone, are comparable to martial intent, and mental energy is your cultivation. The two are interlinked and complement each other…” Mu Xueling was calm as she started her lecture. She didn’t pursue the matter between Lin Yun and Jiang Feng. She started from the simplest to the connection between tone and mental energy.

“If your mental energy isn’t sufficient, there’s no way you can grasp a higher tone, nor can you fully exhibit the power of the music…” As Mu Xueling continued, everyone was soon captivated by her teachings.

But Lin Yun softly muttered because his current state was exactly as Mu Xueling had said.

“Student Lin, what are you muttering? Are you unhappy with my teachings?” Mu Xueling turned to look at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun bitterly smiled when he heard that because he knew he had caught Mu Xueling’s attention. He replied, “No, there’s nothing.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Go on. You can just share what you want to say.” Mu Xueling said. “If you have any doubts, I will do my best to help you. Or do you think I’m not capable of doing that?”

Lin Yun could only toughen his scalp and asked, “What level of mental energy do I need to grasp the Saint Tone?”

“If you grasp the Saint Tone, you can be considered a Grand Musician. You’ll require mental energy comparable to a sixth-grade Saint Spiritualist to grasp it. But under most situations, it’s hard for seventh or even eighth-grade Saint Spiritualists to grasp Saint Tone.” Mu Xueling said calmly.

“Is there any exception of anyone grasping Saint Tone before reaching the sixth-grade Saint Spiritualist?” Lin Yun asked.

“No.” Mu Xueling replied.

“Are you trying to speak about yourself?” Jiang Feng snickered.

But Mu Xueling ignored Jiang Yu, and she continued, “If your mental energy isn’t enough, there’s no way you can grasp Saint Tone. Although there were ways in to achieve it ancient times, they are long lost in the current era. Do you have any questions?”

“None.” Lin Yun smiled.

Mu Xueling gently waved her hand, and multiple zithers fell from the sky. She said, “You are all musicians, so I’ll teach you guys how to kill with music. Killing your enemy with music is simple; you just have to protect your mental energy through music…”
