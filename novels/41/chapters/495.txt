Chapter 496 - Blood like a River

Everyone began to make their move the moment the mist started to dissipate. Countless people bolted towards the Indigoflame Goldlotus. The mist was still crackling with lightning and flame, which made the lake seem even more beautiful.

“No one can resist the temptation of the Indigoflame Goldlotus…” Lin Yun sighed next to Liu Yunyan. Did reaching there first mean that they would be able to get the Indigoflame Goldlotus? It was a pity that no one understood logic.

“It’s hard to reach the Violet Palace Realm, even for disciples of the quasi-overlord forces. Furthermore, the Indigoflame Goldlotus can refine the origin energy,” said Liu Yunyan. No one could resist the temptation of the Indigoflame Goldlotus, even Lin Yun wasn’t an exception.

The elites who had reached the Violet Palace Realm couldn’t resist the temptation either. After all, even if they had reached the Violet Palace Realm, they could still refine their origin energy with the Indigoflame Goldlotus and increase their strength.

Lin Yun had converted his origin energy into the silver sword energy. If he could refine his sword energy again with the Indigoflame Goldlotus, the density of his origin energy would grow even more shocking. Furthermore, it would be great if he could use it to make a breakthrough.

As time slowly passed, the battles of demonic beasts and human cultivators could be heard. The stench of blood lingered in the atmosphere and corpses littered the ground. Some belonged to demonic beasts while some belonged to human cultivators.

The scene was shocking, but it still couldn’t deter anyone’s excitement. The Heavenly Province Academy’s party also encountered many demonic beasts along the way, but they were rather lucky because they didn’t run into any elite demonic beasts. Lin Yun and Liu Yunyan didn’t even need to help out.

Suddenly, a gigantic crimson wolf descended from the sky with rapid speed as its claw heavily injured many disciples. The crimson wolf then released a weird laugh before it charged at Bai Yi, who was at the back of the party. This instantly made many people exclaim because their formation had been disrupted.

Liu Yunyan turned her head over with her brows furrowed. But when she turned her head, Lin Yun was nowhere to be seen.

“What speed!” Liu Yunyan was shocked by Lin Yun’s speed. His movement technique wasn’t any inferior to some core disciples she had seen, not to mention that he came from the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

The dracophant energy spread out on Lin Yun’s body and his aura started boiling. When he landed on the ground, he sent the crimson wolf flying with a punch. It was just like how he attacked the Bloodwing Pavilion’s disciples. His punch instantly rumbled like lightning in everyone’s ears.

When his second punch reached the crimson wolf, it instantly caused an explosive collision with twenty cauldron’s worth of strength. The shockwave of his punch affected a few of the disciples in the surroundings and they were sent flying. At the same time, his punch turned the demonic wolf ‘s head into a bloody mist.

With that, the lesser Yin stage demonic wolf became a headless corpse that fell to the ground. This scene shocked many people.

“That fellow…” Many people were stunned as they looked at Lin Yun. The demonic wolf might not be strong, but it was fast. If Lin Yun didn’t act, who knows how many people would be injured by it.

“Big Brother Lin!” Bai Yi quickly ran over. But before Lin Yun could comfort her, a gigantic black ape jumped out from the woods. It had a cultivation in the lesser Yin stage and was an elite demonic beast.

And before anyone could react, two more demonic beasts appeared that were emitting terrifying auras. They were all elite demonic beasts in the lesser Yin stage.

“This…” The faces of the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples changed. Elite demonic beasts were rare, but these demonic beasts actually bundled together with the birth of the Indigoflame Goldlotus.

But the three demonic beasts were extremely cautious, so they didn’t charge immediately. They slowly approached as they emitted a powerful aura, casting fear into everyone’s hearts.

“I have an idea,” said Liu Yunyan.

“Oh?” Lin Yun instantly understood what she was planning and said, “Then we’ll go with that. You guys go while I deal with these three demonic beasts.”

Liu Yunyan was surprised when she looked at Lin Yun. She replied, “I meant that I’ll handle the three demonic beasts, while you leave with the rest. I’ll catch up once I deal with them.”

Lin Yun didn’t think that it was a bad idea. After all, it was more than enough for Liu Yunyan to deal with the three demonic beasts with her strength.

“But since you offered, then I’ll let you handle them,” smiled Liu Yunyan.

“It’s really ‘tough’ on you. But it’s for the best,” smiled Lin Yun bitterly. His eyes brimmed with fighting spirit because the fight with the Bloodwing Pavilion wasn’t satisfying enough. He didn’t even bring out half of his strength, so now he could have his fun with the three elite demonic beasts.

Graceful Moment, Absolute Hit!

Lin Yun flicked out three silvery sword rays with his fingers at the three demonic beasts. This made the three demonic beasts howl out in pain as their gazes fell onto Lin Yun. At the same time, their pressure made Lin Yun’s bones start to crackle, but his blood continued to boil.

“Let’s go!” Liu Yunyan took advantage of this moment and led the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples out of the encirclement. A few of them even turned back to look at how Lin Yun fought the three demonic beasts. His hair was fluttering in the wind with his sword intent empowered by his dracophant energy. He was fighting with the three demonic beasts evenly.

“Senior Sister Liu, c-can he do it?” asked a disciple.

“Believe in him,” replied Liu Yunyan.

“Big Brother Lin, take care!” yelled Bai Yi as the group swiftly approached the Indigocloud Lake under Liu Yunyan’s lead.

“This woman is really fast…” smiled Lin Yun. Liu Yunyan was more decisive than he had imagined. But that was also great because he didn’t want to reveal his true strength in front of so many people.

The three demonic beasts didn’t give Lin Yun much time to think. The moment they realized that he was distracted, they instantly pounced on him. The ground trembled with cracks spreading out on the ground as three demonic auras intertwined in the sky.

“Great!” Lin Yun’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit as he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and Dracophant Battle Physique. He combined the two energies together and charged forward like a volcanic eruption. When his power reached the limit, Lin Yun’s aura became like a sword that tore through the three demonic beasts’ aura.

They wanted to kill Lin Yun, but their attacks weren’t enough. Lin Yun took a step forward and unleashed the Dragon-Tiger Might. The two terrifying auras clashed together. Lin Yun was facing three at once, but his aura had crushed the combined aura of the three demonic beasts.

He clenched his fist together and threw out a punch. His punch released the roar of a dracophant, which sent the Blackiron Demonic Ape, who was the closest, flying. Then, he started forming the four seals. Even without throwing his punch, the aura of the four combined seals made the three demonic beasts stop in their tracks.

When his punch reached them, they were sent flying away, creating three craters on the ground. Lin Yun then spread his arms apart with the Seven Profound Steps—Golden Crow Wings and appeared before the three demonic beasts in the next second.

Then, he followed up with a series of combos that utilized the Dragon-Tiger Fist. The Soaring Dragon, Hidden Dragon, Crouching Tiger, Hundred Beast Wave, and Vanquishing Dragon and Tiger. The impact from the attacks made the ground tremble violently.

If Liu Yunyan was here, she would definitely look at Lin Yun with disbelief. Lin Yun was like an ancient beast as his punches contained twenty cauldrons’ worth of strength. The roars of dragon, tiger, and dracophant, and the sound of sword intent were constantly heard throughout the surroundings.

The moment the three demonic beasts caught an opening, they fled without looking back. The beating that they took was too miserable. In their eyes, Lin Yun was a demon.

“This is the end,” said Lin Yun as the Iris Flower bloomed in his dantian. When the flower bloomed, the sword energy within Lin Yun’s body roared like a tsunami. At the same time, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up like two stars in the darkness as he had unleashed his xiantian sword intent, without holding anything back. “None of you can run…” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Grabbing onto the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun roared, “Thunderbolt Slash!”

His sword was like a bolt of lightning that streaked across the horizon, devouring the three demonic beasts instantly and leaving behind a huge bloody mist.
