Chapter 2046 - Ice Bird Carriage

“Haha, I bet that woman never expected you to be a scumbag. Not only did she fail to charm you, but she even lost her treasure!” Lil’ Purple gloated after watching this from the sword box.

Lin Yun toyed with the Great Solar Saint Pellet and said, “I didn’t expect there to be a treasure that can temper the Astral Sword Intent.”

“There are, and what she said was right. Those treasures can only be found in sword dao holy lands,” Lil’ Purple said. “Furthermore, not everyone can acquire it. Only holy sons can have it because such a pellet is naturally precious.”

Lin Yun nodded in agreement. Like the Heavenly Dao Sect, they had True Dragon Saint Liquid refined from the blood of true dragons, but a treasure of that level wasn’t something that just anyone could obtain, even if they were holy sons. So the sword dao holy land naturally had a treasure of that caliber.

Lin Yun toyed around with the Great Solar Saint Pellet before stowing up, ignoring Wang Muyan’s threat before she left.

They weren’t finished yet? Of course, they weren’t finished because Lin Yun had no intentions of letting her go, and they would have a battle sooner or later.

When dawn arrived, Lin Yun bade farewell to the two mistresses before leaving with the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint to Heavenly Dao Sect’s transportation array. The Hidden Sword Manor was located on the Southern Border and was far from the Eastern Desolation. Even a saint would take thirty-odd days to travel across this distance.

There were dangers along the way, and they would be in trouble if they weren’t careful. They would have to rely on the transportation array if they wanted to quickly reach the Southern Border. Such a teleportation array was left behind from ancient times, and the runes were so complicated that even modern Heavenly Spiritualists couldn’t completely comprehend them.

When the teleportation array was activated, countless runes intertwined and formed into a spiritual array. The spiritual array enveloped them, and the surrounding space began to distort. When a powerful spatial fluctuation appeared from the surroundings, Lin Yun became nervous because he and the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint would be killed by space if there was a slight mistake.

“Calm down. This transportation array was left behind from ancient times, set up by a Saint Spiritualist who grasped spatial dao. So the spatial channel is stable even now,” the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint smiled.

“How long will it take for us to arrive?” Lin Yun asked, looking at the light in the surroundings.

“A few minutes,” the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint said.

“Peak Master, are there any forces I have to take note of at the Sword Alliance?” Lin Yun asked.

“The Sword Alliance was formed between the sword dao holy lands from the Southern Border, Western Desert, and Northern Ridge. Aside from the Hidden Sword Manor, three sword dao holy lands can be considered immortal holy lands.” An immortal holy land was similar to the Heavenly Dao Sect and Divine Phoenix Mountain, who had inheritances that have been passed down since before ancient times.

The strength between sword dao holy lands varies, and many holy lands had an inheritance since ancient times. But they didn’t exist before ancient times. Some holy lands have appeared after ancient times but had the weakest foundation amongst all of the holy lands.

“The three holy lands are the Frostsnow Sacred Palace, Myriad Sword Pavilion, and Black Plume Palace. The Frostsnow Sacred Palace and Myriad Sword Pavilion are still alright. Still, the Black Plume Palace is a demonic holy land with a close connection with Demon Gate, and they’re domineering,” the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint said.

“What about Skysolute City?” Lin Yun asked.

“Skysolute City is special because the Sword Emperor established it. It only has three thousand years of inheritance, and any holy land in the Sword Alliance would have a stronger foundation than Skysolute City. But because the Sword Emperor established it, Skysolute City caught up and even surpassed the Sword Alliance. The relationship between Skysolute City and Sword Alliance is a little special,” the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint said.

That should roughly be the relationship between the new and old holy lands; they probably didn’t have a good relationship together. While they were chatting, the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint took this opportunity to explain the Sword Alliance to Lin Yun and the origin of the other holy lands.

According to the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint, the Sword Alliance didn’t have a long history. It was established long ago to confront the Nine Emperors, supporting each other. There were still such alliances within the Kunlun Realm, but they maintained a low profile and had formed a pretty good relationship with the Divine Dragon Empire.

The Nine Emperors were too strong back then, forcing the holy lands to ally. But even so, it was hard for them to confront the Nine Emperors. If the Southern Emperor didn’t die and conflict appeared amongst the Nine Emperors, they would have destroyed the holy lands.

Lin Yun didn’t expect there to be such a history.

“But the situation is different now. The Golden Era is arriving, and the Divine Dragon Empire wants to recruit all the holy lands. So the Kunlun Realm might be united,” the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint said. “At that time, the Empress’ glory will shine in each corner of the Divine Dragon Era, and the glory in ancient times might reappear.”

Lin Yun looked at the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint and said nothing. He knew some secrets, and the Empress probably wouldn’t be satisfied with just uniting the Kunlun Realm in name.

Lin Yun and the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint appeared in a transportation array a few minutes later. This was the outer gates of the Hidden Sword Manor, just like how the Sword Sect had a massive city outside.

This city was filled with people from different forces, and this city was named Nether Ethereal City. This region was differentiated into ten regions, each equivalent to an isolated city.

The Heavenly Dao Sect had a branch in Nether Ethereal City, and they were received the moment they came out of the transportation array. The Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint asked around and found out that the Sword Assembly would be held ten days from now, so they had arrived pretty late.

The current Nether Ethereal City was crowded with sword dao holy lands from every corner of the Kunlun Realm. Genius swordsmen who were rarely seen could be seen everywhere here.

Lin Yun rested in the branch for two days before he planned to look around and find more information about the genius swordsmen.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Friend, do you want to buy a sword? Are you interested in swords forged by a Heavenly Spiritualist from the Hidden Sword Manor?” A youth asked, looking at Lin Yun with a smile.

When Lin Yun came over, he asked, “You’re a disciple of the Hidden Sword Manor?”

Disciples of the Hidden Sword Manor were marked by their clothes, so no one would dare to pretend to be a Hidden Sword Manor’s disciple.

“You can take it that way.” The youth’s cultivation was at the Nirvana Stage, and he looked awkward after hearing what Lin Yun said.

“The Hidden Sword Manor’s disciple is here to sell swords?” Lin Yun said as he looked at the swords in front of the store. They were mostly ordinary saint artifacts, so Lin Yun didn’t dare to draw them out and only sensed them through the scabbard.

Even so, Lin Yun could sense that these swords weren’t simple and were a tad stronger than ordinary saint artifacts.

“The Hidden Sword Manor is famous for forging swords, and the Sword Assembly is a grand event held every two decades. All the genius swordsmen within the Kunlun Realm will naturally take this opportunity to buy swords, and we can also take this opportunity to earn Nirvana Pellets,” the youth smiled.

“This sword isn’t bad, and it’s stronger than normal saint swords,” Lin Yun said.

The youth’s eyes lit up, and he smiled, “Pretty good eyesight you have there. Even ordinary saint swords were forged with sacred flames from underground veins. Some myriad rune saint artifacts were forged with dragon flames or phoenix flames. If you like it, you can try drawing it out.”

Lin Yun merely smiled when he heard that and asked, “What about Cauldron Sword?”

“That’s a Sovereign Saint Sword, and it has to be tempered through heavenly flames,” the youth smiled.

Lin Yun was curious and sat beside the store to chat with the youth. Suddenly, Lin Yun noticed a familiar figure. It was Ye Ziling who was walking over, emitting a chill around her. Lin Yun was stunned when he saw Ye Ziling because they had last met at the Martial Arts Tea Party.

It had been a year since they last met. Ye Ziling had become nobler, and her Divine Dragon Sword Physique was stronger.

“I like Flower Burial, but what has it to do with you, Lin Yun?”

Lin Yun smiled bitterly as he recalled their relationship. Ye Ziling was considered the most bizarre woman Lin Yun had come across.

“Is she pretty?” The youth smiled.

When Lin Yun nodded, the youth continued, “I advise you not to provoke her. Her name is Ye Ziling, also known as Divine Frost Dragon. She has grasped the Frost Intent and has obtained an ancient saint origin. She caused a commotion when she just came to Nether Ethereal City, but she doesn’t have a good temper, and those who wanted to get close to her were taught a lesson.”

The youth waved his hand and said, “See that White Dragon Saint Sword? It is an ancient saint sword made from a forging technique that has been long lost.”

Lin Yun merely smiled because he naturally knew about that. After all, he was the one who gave the White Dragon Saint Sword to Ye Ziling. But he didn’t expose himself.

The youth continued flaunting his information, “She also has an extraordinary origin. Not only is she a direct descendant of an Ancient Saint Clan, but she’s also Jian Jingtian’s daughter. You know about Jian Jingtian, right?”

“I’ve heard of him,” Lin Yun nodded.

Seeing Lin Yun’s calm expression, the youth unhappily said, “Jian Jingtian is a legend. He was first at the Sword Assembly two decades ago. You can imagine how shocking it was for a sect that isn’t a holy land to nurture a genius like him.”

Lin Yun didn’t expect his senior brother to be so famous even within Hidden Sword Manor.

Right then, a tremor came from the road as a terrifying chill swept over from the far end of the street. Under the chill, a snow-white ice bird pulled a luxurious carriage and stopped before Ye Ziling.

The ice bird had a wisp of an ice phoenix’s bloodline, releasing an aura that was at the Quasi-Saint Realm. The terrifying aura frightened many people in the streets, making them back off.

“Who’s that person?” Lin Yun frowned.

“You don’t know about him? The one seated in the carriage is Gu Zijing, the disciple of the Ice Emperor,” the youth said nervously.

The Ice Emperor might not be one of the Nine Emperors, but he also stood at the top of the pyramid within the Kunlun Realm. The Frostsnow Sacred Palace was one of the three holy lands at the Sword Alliance, and the Ice Emperor was a genius swordsman in the past. His achievement in his frost sword dao was even stronger than Yu Qingfeng.

Since this person could become the Ice Emperor’s disciple, he must be a genius swordsman and here for the Sword Assembly’s champion position. But what was this fellow trying to do by stopping before Ye Ziling?

Gu Zijing’s voice came out from the carriage, “Lady Ziling, I have already sent you three invitations, and you didn’t give me a reply. So I can only come and invite you personally. I wonder if you’ll give me face?”

But Ye Ziling’s face was cold and had no intentions of replying to Gu Zijing. She simply turned around and left.

“How dare you be so rude!” A servant on the carriage flew into the sky and appeared before Ye Ziling.

When the Radiant Snow Flower appeared from the depths of Ye Ziling’s pupils, she coldly said, “Get lost.”

“Young Master is the direct disciple of the Ice Emperor. Aren’t you a little too much to be so ruthless?” The servant said.

“So what?” Ye Ziling had no change on her face as her hand fell onto the White Dragon Saint Sword. A powerful murderous intent then swept out with a dragon coiling around her.

“Back down. Don’t make things difficult for Lady Ye.” Gu Zijing’s voice came from the carriage, then he said, “Lady Ye, I just wish to meet you after hearing your name, and I have no intentions of making things difficult for you.”

But what responded to him was a sword ray. Ye Ziling drew her sword and sent the servant flying away.

“But I have no interest in you,” Ye Ziling said and left.

Gu Zijing raised his cup in the carriage and smiled, “Her temper is as foul as rumored.”

The interior of the carriage was like a palace. Gu Zijing was seated in it with six beautiful maids around him.

“Let’s go,” Gu Zijing sighed. One of his maid quickly helped the injured driver up and left this place.

“Haha, I didn’t expect the famous Gu Zijing to suffer a loss,” the youth smiled. But shortly after, his face was plastered with surprise because Lin Yun had disappeared.

“What speed!” The youth swept a gaze over his store and heaved a sigh of relief after seeing that he didn’t lose any sword.

As for Lin Yun, he was already quietly chasing after Ye Ziling. Since Ye Ziling was here, this meant others from the Sword Sect must be here as well.
