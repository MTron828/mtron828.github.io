Chapter 1029 - Death To Those Who Touch The Reverse Scale of a Dragon

The Ancient Demon Seal Array was used in ancient times to suppress and kill ancient demonic beasts. However, the complete array diagram wasn’t around any more. Although the Ancient Demon Seal Array used by the nine generals wasn’t complete, it was practically invincible in the Heavenly Path. After all, it could suppress geniuses and beasts alike in the Heavenly Soul Realm, especially once the Beast Soul Pearls were used.

Nine pairs of eyes were looking at Lin Yun with the intent to make him pay. The spectators couldn’t imagine facing the situation Lin Yun was currently in. Indeed, the trap set up by the Realm Sons wasn't that simple.

“Lin Yun, you can die now!” A general roared from the head of the statue. This caused the heaven and earth to start trembling as the Ancient Demon Seal Array began to emit a terrifying aura. Everyone in the surroundings immediately spit up blood as soon as the Ancient Demon Seal Array began working.

The entire region was plunged into darkness and the Heavenly Soul Realm experts were blinded. They couldn’t sense a single thing. Suddenly, a beast roar echoed in the ears of everyone present, causing their souls to tremble. With fear, they discovered that they couldn’t do anything under the immense pressure.

“Oh my god!”

“Did the ancient beasts come to life?”

“How terrifying… I can’t move. Damn it, what’s going on?!” Everyone began to panic because the Ancient Demon Seal Array was more terrifying than advertised. Suddenly, all nine pairs of eyes started to blaze with flames.

Is Lin Yun going to die? The spectators couldn’t help worrying when they saw the Ancient Demon Seal Array working to tear Lin Yun apart. In ancient times, the ancient demonic beasts were killed after they were trapped, which is what the Ancient Demon Seal Array was doing to Lin Yun.

“Futile effort!”

“What ignorance. No one can survive the Ancient Demon Seal Array!”

“What a pity… the more you struggle, the more you suffer…” The three head generals sneered when they looked at Lin Yun. The Heavenly Path had given birth to many strong people in the past, but they were all killed by the Ancient Demon Seal Array in the end.

The head generals didn’t panic, ignoring the fact that Lin Yun defeated them.

“Answer me, what’s wrong with Yue Weiwei?” Lin Yun’s cold voice shook the head generals’ souls.

When they recovered, they felt embarrassed. The Nether Divinity War Realm’s head general replied, “You dare to be arrogant even when facing death? You should be worried about yourself instead!”

“Haha, didn’t we say that we would take care of Yue Weiwei for you?” Someone added. “You’re about to die, but you’re concerned about that woman? She must taste pretty good if she’s still on your mind. Don’t worry, we won’t treat her badly after you die, hahaha!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Even a dragon had to lie down when facing the Ancient Demon Seal Array, so Lin Yun’s situation wasn’t looking that good.

“You’re not going to reply? You guys can die then!” Lin Yun’s voice sounded out once more. Suddenly, all nine generals felt great pressure. “Not good!” they yelled. “Quick, suppress him! The beast souls won’t be able to last!”

The nine generals instantly sensed that something wasn’t right as beads of sweat covered their forehead. Then, the crimson eyes began to unleash boundless aura that crashed down on Lin Yun. “Ancient Demon Seal Array—Annihilation!”

“Break!” But right at this moment, Lin Yun roared with a Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix flying out of his body. Then, an aura surpassing a fortune martial technique exploded from Lin Yun’s body. In the next second, the radiance from the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix swept away all of the darkness.

As golden and silver radiance began to flicker on the surface of Lin Yun’s body, the beast souls howled while being destroyed. An unbelievable scene of blood rained down as the Ancient Demon Seal Array broke down.

The nine generals threw up blood as their faces turned pale. On top of the statue, the head generals couldn’t believe that the Ancient Demon Seal Array was broken. But what made them even more shocked was the aura coming from Lin Yun. His aura had finally made them feel threatened.

“How did he manage to do it?!” It was at the level of a holy spirit martial technique, but it was normally impossible for a Heavenly Soul Realm genius to reach that level.

“Quick, leave! We can’t stay any longer!” The three head generals instantly made their decision. Even if Lin Yun had only grasped the surface of a holy spirit martial technique, it wasn’t something they could face. A holy spirit martial technique had transcended fortune and went beyond the level of a monstrous genius.

“You think you can leave?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a killing aura brewing in his eyes. His face was never so dark and roared, “All of you, die!”

As space fluctuated, a gigantic silver winged and golden winged human appeared behind Lin Yun. Their wings unfolded and an immense pressure swept out, overwhelming the head generals. To their dismay, they realized that the surrounding space was being restricted.

“Damn it, what’s going on?!”

“We can’t get out!” The generals began to panic.

“Let’s go all out! He still hasn’t grasped the holy spirit martial technique completely!” The three head generals’ faces changed as they made the decision to charge at Lin Yun. Their way of thinking was naive. After all, they clearly underestimated Lin Yun’s strength and anger. They must have forgotten that Lin Yun wanted to kill them.

When Lin Yun walked forward, he looked like a deity as every single strand of hair had a golden shine. He had the luster of a sun, which made it hard for others to look at him. When he raised his hand, he instantly destroyed half the body of a general. Then, he waved his hand to shatter the attacks of the other generals. After spreading his hands apart, he decapitated another general.

In the next second, a bright moon rose behind Lin Yun and dyed him silver. Just like that, Lin Yun swung his sword around and arrived before the three head generals. His surroundings were covered in blood while several corpses went flying. At this moment, the purple mark on his forehead made him look extraordinary.

Just like that, Lin Yun looked at the three generals indifferently and marched forward with boundless killing aura in his pupils. At this moment, he could reach the holy spirit martial technique by merging the sun and moon.

The head generals tried their best to resist Lin Yun’s killing aura with the treasures in their hands. However, their efforts were futile because Lin Yun was too strong. It didn’t take long before they were crushed against the statue.

Right at this moment, a voice sounded out from afar with prestige, “Stop! Sinner Lin Yun, stop now and we can consider sparing your life!”

“Realm Sons! The Realm Sons are here!” Excitement flashed in the pupils of the head generals as their faces turned rosy. “The Realm Sons are here, hahaha!”

The head generals began to laugh as they looked at Lin Yun with cold eyes. The white-clothed youth looked at Lin Yun with disdain, “Ant from the lower realm, why aren’t you begging for your life now that the Realm Sons are here?!”

The two head generals beside him laughed as well. They were confident that Lin Yun couldn’t do anything to them, but they were met with a sword ray that descended from the sky. Lin Yun’s sword ray shattered the phenomena that they created from the three treasures.

“The Realm Sons? They’re nothing in my eyes!” Lin Yun slowly sheathed his sword as all of the head generals’ heads split in two. He had given death to those who deserved it. Realm Sons? So what if they were coming? No one could prevent him from killing those hewanted to kill!
