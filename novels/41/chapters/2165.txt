Chapter 2166: You're A Phoenix

The night came late tonight. It was clearly dusk for a long time, but Lin Yun could feel himself waiting on Soarstream Peak for a long time before the night reluctantly arrived.

Lin Yun removed the Divine Tortoise Transformation and returned to his original appearance. He sat with his legs crossed on the mountain. He had a calm personality, but he couldn’t recall how many times he had opened his eyes. Whenever he opened his eyes, the sun was still hanging over the horizon.

He began to wonder if Su Ziyao wouldn’t come because she was furious. He would be lying to say that he wasn’t feeling guilty. He and Yue Weiwei had experienced life and death, and they were familiar with each other. But, he could be considered wife and husband with Su Ziyao since they already did, but there had always been a layer of fog between them for some reason. Most importantly, it was because of his guilty conscience, and he felt that he would be overwhelmed by Su Ziyao’s aura.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes again, the God Burial Mountain Range was in front of him. As he looked at the mountain range, he saw a mountain that seemed to have a strange flower blooming on it, shining brightly. He asked, “Empress, what’s that?”

“There’s nothing there,” Lil’ Purple said as she came out of the Iris Secret Realm.

“Really? But I seemed to have seen a flower. It looks similar to the Iris Flower, and it’s weird. It looks familiar to the flower on the sword box,” Lin Yun said.

“Really?” Lil’ Purple’s interest was piqued. The Iris Flower was rare, and phoenix blood could be found in places where the Iris Flower could be found. This was a secret that only the Divine Phoenix Clan knew of. But it was hard for others to find the phoenix blood even if they came across an Iris Flower since it required a special means.

“It might be fake. After all, it only appeared for a split second,” Lin Yun said.

Lil’ Purple was serious as she said, “This is the God Burial Mountain Range, a place where deities fell in the past. So there might really be an Iris Flower. Let’s go take a look.”

“How can that be? It’s too much of a coincidence, so let’s not go there,” Lin Yun said.

“Hmph. Are you looking down on me? I have to go, no matter what!” Lil’ Purple said unhappily. Suddenly, she looked at Lin Yun and said, “You’re not waiting for someone and trying to lure me away on purpose, right?”

Lil’ Purple naturally didn’t hear what Su Ziyao said to him, so she didn’t know that Lin Yun was waiting for Su Ziyao.

“Hmph, I don’t care. I’ll go and look for the Iris Flower,” Lil’ Purple smiled as she left, swiftly disappearing.

“It’s really not easy to fool her,” Lin Yun smiled. But when a breeze blew, his face changed. He subconsciously turned around but there was no one there, which left him a little disappointed. But he suddenly noticed that there was a woman wearing a bamboo hat in front of him.

When she removed her bamboo hat, he knew that this person was naturally Su Ziyao. She was as aloof as Bai Shuying, but there was a hint of nobility being emitted from her that made her stand out. She was like an emperor that would make others feel great pressure.

“Who’s hard to bluff?” Su Ziyao smiled. She might be smiling, but Lin Yun could sense a hint of murderous intent.

This made Lin Yun cough because it was too much of a coincidence. Fortunately, Su Ziyao didn’t pursue it, but smiled, “Let’s go.”

“Okay.” The two strolled across the mountain, but neither of them spoke. Lin Yun was feeling a slightly guilty conscience after admitting that An Liuyan was his woman in public. But taking a step back, An Liuyan had done too much for him, and she would wear a smile on her face no matter what happened.

As for Su Ziyao, he truly loved her, and he was willing to do anything for her. Love wasn’t something that could be brushed past by just pretending to be deaf and dumb.

He carried a lot in his heart, and he wanted to express his emotions during his meeting with Su Ziyao this time. This was the reason why he lured Lil’ Purple away on purpose. It was better for a man to be magnanimous and leave it to Su Ziyao. He broke the silence, and looked at Su Ziyao, “Ziyao, I have something to say.”

Su Ziyao was almost as tall as him with a cold temperament. She smiled, “You want to talk about those women? If that’s the case, I don’t care how many women you have, and I was sincere when I said that I’d take care of your women for you. If you fall one day, Lin Yun…if you leave one day, I will take care of your women for you, and I won’t let anyone touch them.”

Lin Yun opened his mouth and looked at Su Ziyao with surprise.

“Is it weird?” Su Ziyao looked at Lin Yun, then said, “I’ve cultivated the Empress Heart Sutra. The deeper my love, the stronger my pain. I have to bear great pain just by standing beside you, but I’m still not willing to let go of you.”

Su Ziyao reached out to grab Lin Yun’s wrist. Her hand was cold, but there was a warmth rising within Lin Yun’s heart. In reality, Lin Yun didn’t know that it was hard for someone who practiced the Empress Heart Sutra to fall in love. But the moment they fell in love, they would remain loyal until death.

“It’s hard for someone like me to meet someone who can make my heart beat, but I won’t let go the moment I meet someone like that.” Su Ziyao held onto Lin Yun’s hand a little hard.

Lin Yun was greatly shocked as he held onto Su Ziyao’s hand. He had various emotions in his heart, but he didn’t know how to express them.

Su Ziyao continued, “I already told you back in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. I don’t like the zither, but I only like to play the zither with you. I don’t like the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but I just want to stay with you. I don’t like to reason with others, but I’m willing to lower my head for you. I don’t like to drink, but I like to watch you drink. I’m a vulgar person who doesn’t understand music and someone who will kill when I drink. But because of you, even alcohol doesn’t look that disgusting anymore. Because of you, music came to life for me. I only have you in my eyes.”

“I naturally know that,” Lin Yun said.

Su Ziyao glared at him, and she said, “It’s good that you remember about it. So, why are you looking like you’re going to a battlefield? Am I that frightening?”

Lin Yun didn’t say anything back but came forth to plant his lips on hers. Su Ziyao was furious and briefly struggled, but when they kissed, she hooked her arms around Lin Yun’s neck.

This was a long kiss, and they separated after a long time.

“You’re really bold. I’m still angry, and you’re not allowed to do that in the future. At the very least… you have to coax me first.” Su Ziyao looked at Lin Yun with her tone filled with dignity, but her face had blushed. This was a rare side of her that looked like a young girl who had just discovered love.

“I won’t dare in the future,” Lin Yun said casually, and he planted his lips over again. This time, Su Ziyao smiled and no longer struggled.

“Scumbag, I’m back! There’s really an Iris Flower, but it’s a pity that the phoenix blood has dried up. I obtained the Iris Flower with great difficulty…” A laughter resounded right at this moment as Lil’ Purple returned. She was emotional and excited with dirt on her face. She held onto an Iris Flower with her hands as she dashed over with unconcealable excitement on her face.

She initially thought that Lin Yun was lying to her, but she was surprised to find that there really was an Iris Flower. If someone else found the Iris Flower, they wouldn’t be able to grab onto it.

“Scumbag?” Su Ziyao and Lin Yun had long separated from each other. She asked, “Is that how you call him normally?”

Lil’ Purple was frightened when she saw Su Ziyao. She was a little afraid of her, and she couldn’t help becoming nervous. She said in a panicky tone, “I… I… I… didn’t…”

“Well, you’re right. He’s a scumbag,” Su Ziyao smiled. She looked at Lin Yun, and said, “Even a little girl knows that you’re a scumbag and it looks like you’ve been enjoying it recently. It’s no wonder why you seem so experienced now.”

Lin Yun still wanted to explain, but Su Ziyao smiled as she wore the bamboo hat. “Be careful, and don’t get too close to the Heavenly Dao Sect. The God Burial Mountain Range’s seal has loosened up, and Quasi-Saints can freely enter now. There has been a lot of turmoil recently, so I will first leave with the Blood Word Battalion.”

Su Ziyao left her laughter behind as she disappeared.

After confirming that Su Ziyao left, Lil’ Purple unhappily said, “Hmph, I’m not a little girl…”

“Alright, alright. How did you manage to get the Iris Flower? Wash your face first, look at the dirt on your face,” Lin Yun smiled.

Lil’ Purple burst into tears, “Scumbag, do you also think that I’m a little girl? I shouldn’t have returned and should have gone to play with dirt. I ruined the moment for you.”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled and had no choice but to carry her up. When he looked for a river with her, she kept crying throughout the time, and anyone would be heartbroken to see her. It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to find a creek, which he used to carefully clean her.

“Don’t cry. You’re a phoenix, so how can a phoenix cry all the time?” Lin Yun smiled. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Hmph!” Lil’ Purple was furious as she continued, “You lured me away on purpose to be intimate with Su Ziyao, and you even bluffed me about the Iris Flower. Do you know how terrified I was back then?”

“Alright, stop crying.” Lin Yun bitterly smiled as he cleaned up her face. Suddenly, he thought of something and said, “I forgot to give her the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.”

Lil’ Purple said with her cheeks puffed together, “You only know about Su Ziyao. I can also wear the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. I’m from the Divine Phoenix Clan, and I’m worthy to wear it as well.”

“But you’re too small,” Lin Yun smiled.

Lil’ Purple briefly pondered before she replied, “That’s not wrong. She has a bigger head, so I won’t compete with her for it, then.”
