Chapter 1913 - Soaring To The Sky

When Lin Yun looked around, everyone had finished their trial aside from Chen Zhong. Looking at the surrounding gazes directed at him, Lin Yun looked around and smiled, “Why are you all sitting here? You all failed? Are you serious? Can someone even fail in this trial?!”

Ye Feifan’s face changed and became ugly. Everyone else also looked awkward, and they couldn’t say a word. In the end, Ouyang He said, “We all failed. Ye Qingtian, did you make it through this trial?”

Everyone immediately had a wisp of hope burning within their hearts. Although the possibility was small, there was still some hope.

“I made it through this trial, and it’s pretty simple.” But Lin Yun soon dashed their hopes and even gave a few stomps on their faces. This immediately made everyone’s faces dark, and lowered their heads.

“Brother, you also failed?” Lin Yun smiled.

Ye Feifan’s heart blazed with flames, but he still maintained a gentlemanly disguise and smiled, “As the saying goes, the higher you climb, the harder you fall. The dogs of a village constantly bark the loudest, but they’re still dogs.”

He was insulting Lin Yun, but he still maintained a gentlemanly disguise. If it were someone else with a fiery temper, they would immediately explode upon hearing what Ye Feifan said and might even lose their rationale. Lin Yun would’ve fallen for Ye Feifan’s trap if he lost his temper, giving Ye Feifan the perfect excuse to teach him a lesson. So although the other saint disciples found Ye Feifan despicable, they had to admit that his trick was smart.

Ye Feifan smiled, “I’m talking about a dog, and I don’t mean anyone specific. With your breadth of mind, I believe you’re not someone like that.”

“I’m your father,” Lin Yun smiled.

“You!” Ye Feifan’s smile disappeared. Everyone else was also shocked with their mouths open.

“I’m just joking. I believe that with your breadth of mind, you’re not someone who can’t take a joke,” Lin Yun smiled. “Well then, I’ll carry on my journey to the summit. What I said earlier is still valid. If I have any harvest, I won’t forget sparing you a few Heavenly Clouds Fruits.”

Ye Feifan’s face turned ashened, and he could no longer smile as he clenched his fists. But there were too many people here, and he could only suck it up.

“Ye Qingtian, come here. I’ll accompany you up to the summit.” Wang Muyan looked at Lin Yun, and her ethereal voice drew envy from others onto Lin Yun.

Bai Shuying had no changes on her face. Although she didn’t bet with Wang Muyan, she was confident Ye Qingtian wouldn’t go to her. But she still couldn’t help looking at Ye Qingtian, waiting for his response.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t you want to know why I asked Ye Qingtian to sneak into the Nether Orchid Courtyard? Come here, and I’ll tell you. I believe you’ll be interested in the secret, and it’s related to Bai Shuying. It might even be related to the Three Sword Saints of the Eastern Desolation.” Wang Muyan secretly transmitted her voice to Lin Yun.

“You will know the outcome if you lie to me.” According to Lin Yun’s personality, he naturally had no intentions of interacting with Wang Muyan. But he wanted to know about the secret, especially when she said it was related to the Three Sword Saints. So he had no choice but to go over.

Thus, Bai Shuying was shocked to see Lin Yun walking to the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden. Her face instantly became cold with her murderous intent leaking. She now realized that Ye Qingtian was still the lecher from before.

When Wang Muyan looked at her with a lofty look, this made Bai Shuying furious to the point that her chest began to heave up and down, and her hand trembled as she held onto her sword. She now realized that she was foolish to believe in what Ye Qingtian said.

Just like that, Lin Yun and Wang Muyan climbed the mountain, like a perfect couple, under everyone’s envious gazes.

“Holy shit!”

“The Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden actually took the initiative to invite Ye Qingtian? She probably took a fancy to Ye Qingtian’s potential.”

“How envious…”

“Who knows if he can cause a huge commotion when he successfully climbs the summit.” Discussions resounded from the surroundings.

“Ascend the summit? Someone like him wants to reach the summit? He can only become Wang Muyan’s toy, and just wait to die!” Ye Feifan said enviously.

Everyone else fell into silence, unwilling to echo along with him. After all, Ye Feifan had been slapped multiple times by far. In their views, they had to admit that Ye Qingtian’s potential was extraordinary, and there was a high possibility that he could reach the fourth level.

As for becoming Wang Muyan’s toy, that was only a joke. After all, who here doesn’t want to become Wang Muyan’s toy? But they couldn’t even catch Wang Muyan’s attention.

Ascending the mountain, Lin Yun and Wang Muyan maintained their distance and were cautious. Others could only see how bewitching she was, along with her voluptuous figure. But they didn’t know how terrifying she was. Lin Yun tried to get the secret out of her multiple times, but she refused.

The two made it through the trials and easily ascended the summit. There was a saint sword embedded in the mountain, and they were only one step away from ascending the mountain. But Lin Yun didn’t move and merely turned to look at Wang Muyan.

“Haha. I asked Ye Qingtian to sneak into the Nether Orchid Courtyard to investigate the Solar Lunar Divine Rune,” Wang Muyan’s voice sounded.

“The Solar Lunar Divine Rune is located in the Celestial Pool?” Lin Yun looked at Wang Muyan with a surprised gaze and realized that the latter wore a bewitching smile.

“So you really know about the Solar Lunar Divine Rune! It looks like we have the same objective,” Wang Muyan smiled.

Lin Yun’s heart sank because he knew he had fallen for the trap in her words and coldly said, “You’re starting to get on my nerves!”

“Since we have the same objective, we can be friends. Why don’t we join hands to find the Solar Lunar Divine Rune first? I have more clues than you,” Wang Muyan said.

“You previously said this is related to the Three Sword Saints of the Eastern Desolation. So what did you mean by that?” Lin Yun asked, ignoring what Wang Muyan said.

“Haha. I didn’t say that. I’ll definitely tell you about it. I only said I’ll tell you about the Celestial Pool…” Wang Muyan smiled cunningly and crossed her arms together to lift her chest.

Lin Yun fell into a brief silence before he said, “I have roughly guessed your origin from our fight earlier. But don’t let me catch you. If I do, I’ll make you regret it.”

“We’ll see, then!” the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden smiled.

Lin Yun turned around and ascended the peak. When he ascended the summit, ten-odd three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits flew over. On the other hand, the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden only managed to obtain a Heavenly Cloud Fruit.

“Ye Qingtian, why don’t you give me some?”

“Why should I?”

“If I’m happy, I might share some clues with you. I have always maintained a practice of fair exchange.”

“How much do you want?”

“Half of it!”

Lin Yun’s face sank, and he coldly said, “Only one, and you must tell me first. You won't get any if I’m unhappy with your information.”

“Fine, you miser. The Radiant Sword Saint and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint together found the Solar Lunar Divine Rune. Is this secret enough?” Wang Muyan said in a disdainful tone.

“And?”

“Give it to me first…” Wang Muyan smiled.

Lin Yun glanced at Wang Muyan before taking out a Heavenly Cloud Fruit. Seeing this, Wang Muyan smiled and slightly opened her mouth. She wanted Lin Yun to feed her.

This made Lin Yun briefly stunned. Just when he was going to shrink his hand back, Bai Shuying appeared with murderous intent flashing across her pupils, “Ye Qingtian, you hypocrite!”

She was furious with what she saw when she climbed the summit. She finally realized that what Lin Yun said when he waited for her was all bullshit, and he already had a complicated relationship with Wang Muyan. They both joined hands to fool her the entire time.

This stunned Lin Yun, and he knew he couldn’t cleanse himself now, regardless of what he said.

On the other hand, Wang Muyan took this opportunity to seize the three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit with her mouth.

“As expected of the three-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit. The taste is really good.” Wang Muyan ate as she refined the spiritual energy within the fruit. As a faint radiance emitted from her, her sword intent was slowly getting stronger.

Lin Yun first looked at Bai Shuying’s reaction before turning to look at Wang Muyan. Even if he was slow to respond, he could roughly guess why. He and Bai Shuying were both fooled by Wang Muyan. Even if he tried to explain to Bai Shuying now, she definitely wouldn’t believe him.

This instantly made Lin Yun furious because he had never suffered such a huge loss. He softly said, “Wang Muyan, we’ll wait and see.”

When he finished what he said, he leaped to the sky and rode a Celestial Crane to the fourth level.

As for Wang Muyan and Bai Shuying, they exchanged glances before they ascended a Celestial Crane as well.

Meanwhile, the ancient monument on the Celestial Cloud Mountain shone with four colors.

“Someone ascended the fourth level!”

“Quick, check who ascended the fourth level!”

“Isn’t it obvious? It must be Ye Feifan, Ouyang He, or Chen Zhong. It has been a long time since someone reached the fourth level.”

“The two holy maidens must be among them.” The changes immediately caused an uproar on the Celestial Purging Mountain, making everyone agitated. Looking at the excitement on everyone’s faces, Chen Feng didn’t dare to say a word.

But when the light settled down on the monument, Chen Feng was immediately dumbfounded upon seeing the names on the monument.

The entire Celestial Purging Mountain also fell into a dead silence because the first name to appear on the monument was Ye Qingtian. As a newly conferred saint disciple whose cultivation was at the Profound Death Stage, he was the first to ascend the fourth level before Bai Shuying and Wang Muyan’s names appeared.

After that, no new names appeared for a long time, which left everyone dumbfounded, and they couldn’t believe what they saw.

“How is this possible?!” The Dao Yang Palace’s Chen Jun was amongst the many who were stumped. After all, he had a grudge with Ye Qing tian earlier.

When Ye Qingtian returned, he immediately soared to the sky, and everyone could only see his back.
