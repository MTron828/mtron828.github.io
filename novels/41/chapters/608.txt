Chapter 609 - Why Not?

After refining the Infernal Flower and Firecloud Pellet, Lin Yun resumed his search. However, the fifth level was empty. It seemed like the others had taken the opportunity to scour the place while he was cultivating.

“Looks like there are many people who passed the test. Perhaps the real trial will start at the sixth level,” muttered Lin Yun as he wasn’t too bothered by his current situation. The further he went, the more precious the treasures would be. So Lin Yun didn’t mind.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun headed to the sixth level to start the sixth trial. The sixth trial had six puppets and it was clear that the cooperation between them was more perfect compared to the previous trial. But it wasn’t a problem for Lin Yun since his cultivation had undergone a huge boost.

In just half an hour, the six puppets were rendered into pieces. At the same time, some geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking also made it through this trial.

“I’m lucky to have some harvest from the fifth trial. Otherwise, it won’t be easy for me to make it through the sixth trial…” Guo Xu smiled as his eyes were flashing with anticipation for the sixth level. His strength had undergone a drastic improvement compared to when he first met Lin Yun as there were bolts of lightning flickering through his pupils. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In another corner, Ji Wuye’s eyes flashed as he muttered, “I’m finally at the sixth level. I hope the treasures here won’t be disappointing.”

Ji Wuye didn’t bother looking at the treasures on the first five levels. Only the sixth level had piqued his interest a little. Like him, Xie Yunqiao, Yan Kong, Qin An, and Pei Yue also didn’t bother stopping at the first five levels.

With so many geniuses on the sixth level, there would surely be a fight if they ran into each other. While the geniuses of the Dragoncloud Ranking made it through the sixth trial, most of the other people were eliminated after the fourth level.

With that, more people appeared at the borders of the Withercloud Sea. At the same time, the gap between geniuses grew bigger, so it was impossible for them to catch up anymore. The first three trials eliminated nearly half the participants. After the fourth trial, there were less than a hundred people left. Even worse, only dozens made it through the fifth trial.

It didn’t take long for Zhang Yuan and Mo Ling to be eliminated. Their strength was pretty similar and they were both defeated in the fifth trial. Then again, they also had a pretty good harvest from the first four trials.

“Lin Yun isn’t out,” said Zhang Yuan as he turned to Mo Ling.

“Not surprising. He should have passed the sixth trial by now,” said Mo Ling as she looked at the Withernorth Sea.

“The sixth trial…” Zhang Yuan sighed and he couldn’t hide the disappointment in his tone. His role had suddenly changed with Lin Yun and the difference was that he couldn’t even see the back of Lin Yun’s figure. Just thinking about how he tried to show off his strength in an attempt to recruit Lin Yun to the Heavenly Sword Sect made him blush in shame.

On the sixth level, Lin Yun walked around and confirmed that he was part of the first group of people to reach here. Unlike the fifth level that was plundered, he needed to search this level carefully.

Suddenly, a weak fluctuation came from ahead as Lin Yun raised his head with surprise. The fluctuation was weak, but it was like a comet in the darkness that Lin Yun couldn’t ignore.

“I need to take a look.” Lin Yun took a deep breath with his eyes flickering. He knew he had to be cautious because whoever else was here had also passed the sixth trial. If someone launched a sneak attack against him, then all his effort so far might go down the drain.

As Lin Yun approached, the feeble aura also became even clearer. It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to arrive in a gloomy hall. The ceiling of the hall was decorated with a purple chandelier that emitted a faint glow.

Beneath the chandelier, was an ancient pillar with a white jade slip hovering on top of it. The jade slip was enveloped with purple lightning as it emitted an ancient aura. From the depths of the lightning, Lin Yun could see a black dragon coiling around it.

The aura coming from the dragon was shocking. This should be an ancient technique with lightning attributes. Judging from the aura, it should be an earth grade technique at the very least.

An ancient earth grade technique? Even Lin Yun was tempted by it. After all, techniques from the golden era weren't common, not to mention it was one at the earth grade. If he had guessed correctly, it should be a technique related to body-refining because Lin Yun could sense the dracophant energy within his body stirring uneasily. Could it be that the origin of this technique was an ancient beast that even the dracophant feared?

Right at this moment, a powerful fist aura crackled with lightning as it blew over. It awoke Lin Yun as he turned around and stabbed out with the spear.

When the fist aura exploded, Lin Yun also saw the person who attacked him. It was Guo Xu. Lin Yun’s gaze turned cold when he identified his attacker.

There was really no way he could let his guard down in the empyrean’s tomb. The threat from the punch was great and if his sword intent wasn’t sharp enough to sense it immediately, he couldn’t imagine what kind of consequences there would be.

If his cultivation hadn’t undergone such a great boost that allowed him to destroy the incoming attack with a blow, he would have been in trouble.

When Guoxu saw that it was Lin Yun, he was also shocked. But soon, his gaze turned cold, “You again. You’re going to compete with me for this ancient technique?”

Guo Xu could keenly sense that the technique on the pillar wasn’t simple. His cultivation technique was lightning attributed, which matched this technique perfectly. Even if Lin Yun had obtained it, there was no way he could practice it immediately. However, if Guo Xu obtained it, he could start practicing it immediately.

With the foundation of his lightning attributed cultivation technique, there was a high possibility that he could reach the first stage within four hours. At that time, his strength would undergo a huge boost, and he might even be able to climb to the ninth level.

“Why not? You want me to hand it over to you? Your face is pretty thick,” mocked Lin Yun.

Guo Xu’s pupils flashed coldly when he heard that. Back in the underground palace, he still didn’t place Lin Yun in his eyes. But he never imagined that Lin Yun would grow so quickly and disregard him.

“Did you think that you can disregard all the geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking since you can take a palm from Ji Wuye? Let me tell you honestly that Ji Wuye didn’t use his full strength behind that attack. Not to mention one palm, but I can easily take three palms from him.” As he spoke, he began to accumulate his origin energy and he continued speaking coldly, “I didn’t mind sharing the Profound Yin Water with you. But if you want this ancient technique, then you should give up!”

Suddenly, he thought of something and his gaze fell onto Lin Yun’s sword box. An eerie smile rose on his lips and he said, “Although I don’t know why you’ve never used the sword in your sword box, you’re using that spear as a sword. That means you can’t use your sword, right?”

Even if he was seen through by Guo Xu, Lin Yun still maintained his composure as he replied, “You might have been a formidable figure four years ago, but four years have passed. It’s time for the ranking to change. The fact that you’re still so naive is laughable.”

“What are you trying to say?” Guo Xu’s eyes flashed with doubt when he saw how composed Lin Yun was.

“I don’t need my sword to kill you,” said Lin Yun as he raised his brow. Despite not having his sword right now, Lin Yun didn’t panic. He wasn’t afraid of Guo Xu back then, so it made no sense for him to be afraid now after he had grown a lot stronger. He didn’t even need to bring out his xiantian sword intent at complete mastery. Merely using greater mastery would do.

“What arrogance!” Guo Xu roared as he threw a punch out. He had accumulated this attack for a long time as he began to crackle with lightning. His aura caused the entire chamber to start shaking as a lightning beast flew towards Lin Yun.

“Break!” But before the lightning beast could bare its fangs, Lin Yun had already found its flaw with his xiantian sword intent at greater mastery. Circulating the Iris Sword Sutra, the eighty-four petals bloomed and a sword buzz began to ring out within Lin Yun’s body.

In the blink of an eye, the attack that Guo Xu had accumulated for a long time crumbled easily. When the lightning beast dissipated, Lin Yun’s spear and his figure began to expand within Guo Xu’s eyes. “Like I said, I don’t need my sword to kill you!”

Looking at Lin Yun charging over, Guo Xu’s face changed drastically as he quickly retreated.
