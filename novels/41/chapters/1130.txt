Chapter 1131 - Even More Captivating Than The Moon!

As the full moon hung high in the sky, the auction reached an unprecedented excitement. All of the seats in the Heavenly Star Pavilion were occupied, including the individual rooms. It had been a long time since the Demon Domain was this busy.

Saint artifacts were rare in the Profound Azure Manor, and the same went for the Demon Domain. Even if someone came across one with great luck, there was no way that they would give it up for auction. It might take centuries for something similar to happen.

Those who came to the auction weren’t just demonic cultivators and forces in the Demon Domain, but also elders from various sects. At this moment, the price of the saint artifact had reached a sky-high price of 20,000 Divine Astral Pellets and showed no signs of stopping.

Every time someone bid, a burst of killing aura would come from a room that spread throughout the entire hall. Everyone knew that the killing intent belonged to the owner of the Imperial Hook, the King Suspend Palace’s chief disciple, Chu Tianhao.

Chu Tianhao was a legendary figure among the younger generation, and he had been in seclusion for the past few years to comprehend the highest stage of the King Suspend Art. There were rumors that he appeared despite being at a critical moment. Clearly, he was furious that he lost his saint artifact.

But no one cared about him and continued their bidding. After all, this was the Heavenly Star Pavilion, and they believed that no one dared to cause any trouble here, not even Chu Tianhao!

At the same time, there were several core disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect in a room. The one leading the party had a tall figure and pearly white long legs. She was naturally the strongest core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, Ye Ziling!

She had rushed back from the Profound Azure Manor after learning that Leng Aoran was injured. She didn’t even stop by the sect and headed for the Demon Domain.

“Senior Sister, I already looked into it. Thunderclap Sword Demon is really here watching the auction,” said a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“He’s really bold. Which room is he in right now?” Ye Ziling said with her killing aura leaking out.

“He’s on the highest floor… but this is the Heavenly Star Pavilion. So please don’t be rash. I just heard that the Heavenly Star Pavilion is determined to protect him. They even said that they would hunt down anyone that made a move against him,” said a disciple carefully.

A few other core disciples also tried to persuade Ye Ziling. She was the daughter of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s sect master, so not many people dared to touch her even in the Demon Domain. However, this was the Heavenly Star Pavilion, so she would be killed the moment she made a move.

The Heavenly Star Pavilion had a powerful and mysterious background. They weren’t afraid of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and they wouldn’t hesitate to kill anyone who dared to cause trouble.

There was a common saying in the Demon Domain. There was no transaction that the Heavenly Star Pavilion didn’t dare to take, and there was no one that the Heavenly Star Realm didn't dare to kill.

Ye Ziling’s eyes flashed coldly as she couldn’t calm down. Thunderclap Sword Demon had become a thorn in her heart, especially when she witnessed four core disciples from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect die right in front of her. Whenever she closed her eyes, she would recall what happened.

She swore before their graves that she would personally take the life of Thunderclap Sword Demon with her hands. Now, a rare opportunity had presented itself because Thunderclap Sword Demon was so heavily injured. However, there was nothing she could do since he was hiding in the Heavenly Star Pavilion.

Biting her lips, Ye Ziling was filled with rage while blood dripped from her lips. She ignored the pain from biting her lips as her eyes brewed with growing killing intent.

“Hahaha! 30,000! Anyone with a higher bid? This is a saint artifact. It’s the first of its kind auctioned in the Demon Domain!” The middle-aged plump man smiled because the price of the saint artifact was now at 30,000 Divine Astral Pellets.

“50,000!” When the bid was called, it instantly caused an uproar in the hall. After all, this was a terrifying price for a 100 rune saint artifact. There was a high possibility that this bidder was proficient in using a spear and definitely had a powerful force behind him. Otherwise, a normal person couldn’t afford such an obscene price. There was either a clan or a sect backing the individual.

“50,000!” Ye Ziling’s face became even colder because if anyone could obtain such an enormous sum of resources, they would definitely be able to increase their cultivation swiftly. If Thunderclap Sword Demon got his hands on that amount, she wouldn’t have a chance to go after him anymore. As for Chu Tianhao, he nearly threw up a mouthful of blood when he heard the bid.

In the highest room at the Heavenly Star Pavilion, Thunderclap Sword Demon was sitting in the room with joy on his pale face. He was quite pleased with the astronomical bid. Even if he had to give half to the Heavenly Star Pavilion, it was an enormous amount.

However, he wanted the big to go higher. He heard that Chu Tianhao had come, but he was confident that Chu Tianhao wouldn’t dare to do anything in the Heavenly Star Pavilion. But Chu Tianhao had the King Suspend Palace behind him, and they would definitely buy the Imperial Hook back.

“70,000!” Just as Leng Aoran expected, a voice filled with hatred sounded out in the hall. It shocked the hall into silence before the crowd started to shout. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Even Leng Aoran could feel his heart beating violently while his excited face turned red. In the end, he threw up a mouthful of blood while his cheeks twitched and his face became cold. His face turned sinister because he was still feeling the after effects of the sword intent in his body. Although the sword intent had weakened over the last seven days, it still greatly pained him.

“I’ll definitely get revenge for this matter!” Leng Aoran’s eyes flashed with terrifying killing intent as he drank a cup of wine.

70,000 Divine Astral Pellets was an enormous sum of money that instantly made the entire Heavenly Star Pavilion silent. Even the middle-aged man’s face turned red because the amount had exceeded his imagination. But just when he was about to descend, an ethereal flute music sounded out in the Heavenly Star Pavilion.

The music was beautiful and instantly captivated everyone. When the crowd recovered, they noticed that the music had stopped. Right at this moment, the middle-aged man who was also the Heavenly Star Pavilion’s pavilion master barked, “Who dares to cause trouble here?!”

The guests were shocked because they couldn’t imagine anyone wanted to cause trouble.

Once again, music full of emotions filled the hall and captivated the guests. The middle-aged man’s face sank as he sneered, “Which friend has come? Why are you hiding? Do you dare to show yourself? My Heavenly Star Realm is famous for welcoming guests, and we also have a reputation in the Demon Domain.”

The threat in his voice was obvious as it made the atmosphere in the hall turn chilly. Suddenly, the roof of the Heavenly Star Pavilion collapsed as the moonlight shined down like a silver waterfall.

Donned in silver clothes and hair, Lin Yun held onto the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute as he slowly descended from the sky. The fact that he descended while basking in moonlight simply made him stand out even more. Instantly, the crowd recognized him. Flower Burial!
