Chapter 830 - Five Claws

“Thank you.” Lin Yun sheathed his sword and cupped his hands together. After devouring half of Jiang Ziye’s profound amber aura, his dragon projection grew as dazzling as a bright star.

Lin Yun’s victory was within everyone’s expectations, but the process was unexpected. His sword technique was so terrifying that Jiang Ziye never had an opportunity to take control of the fight. From the beginning, Jiang Ziye was suppressed by Lin Yun.

Because Jiang Ziye was in a hurry to defend herself, she couldn’t bring out the full power of her attacks. It wasn’t because she didn’t want to, but she couldn’t. Before Lin Yun’s sword techniques, she couldn’t even bring out 50% of his strength.

“The boost in this cultivation made his overlord sword flow even smoother. It’s much more terrifying than before.”

“Every single one of his swords is lethal and exhausts a great amount of origin energy. It makes sense that his sword techniques became more powerful after reaching the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm.”

“No wonder he defeated Yan Long’zi. His sword is very patient and he doesn’t make mistakes.” The crowd discussed Lin Yun’s performance as they watched his dragon projection grow. Time and again, Lin Yun had demonstrated outrageous strength. Although his breakthrough wasn’t as dramatic as Mu Han’s performances, his sword techniques were constantly improving.

“Senior brother, he’s pretty strong, especially his attainments in the sword,” said an Indigomoon Elysium’s disciple with a grave expression. The disciple emphasized the sword and not Lin Yun’s sword technique. The two might seem the same, but they were very different. Someone with high attainments in the sword naturally had a powerful sword technique. It was never the other way around.

Lin Yun clearly had high attainments in the sword. Even without his overlord sword, sword techniques weren’t weak in his hands. The feeling he gave others was similar to Yu Haotian. It was similar to how Yu Haotian could control the Overlord Fist as he wished while executing any fist techniques he wanted.

Yu Haotian had an indifferent look on his face and said, “His attainment in the sword isn’t weak, but let’s talk about it after he defeats Zhao Wuji. Yan Long’zi might be a piece of garbage, but what he said wasn’t wrong. Little tricks are futile before absolute strength.”

Yu Haotian’s face was calm, but his tone was filled with arrogance. Rather than being interested in the outcome of the fight, Yu Haotian was interested in Yan Long’zi’s flame dragon bloodline. Yan Long’zi’s flame dragon bloodline might be thin, but it was pure.

He never thought the profound amber aura would extract the blood essence after Yan Long’zi died. This meant that he had lost the opportunity to get Yan Long’zi’s blood essence. However, if Yu Haotian applied the same logic to Lin Yun, he could extract Yan Long’zi’s blood essence from Lin Yun. All he needed to do was kill Lin Yun. The depths of Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed coldly when he thought of this.

The battles continued as the unlucky Wu Xiaotian ran into Mu Han. Wu Xiaotian might have had a chance to win, but he was still recovering from his injuries. This meant that he lost every single match for the top ten. However, Lin Yun discovered that Wu Xiaotian’s mindset was good as he was trying to perfect his fist technique.

Clearly, Wu Xiaotian benefited greatly from the banquet, even though he kept losing. The next battle attracted many people’s attention as it involved Zhao Wuji and Yue Weiwei.

Yue Weiwei had more or less recovered from her injuries. She finally stopped acting so playful and fought Zhao Wuji seriously. Zhao Wuji was forced to reveal some of his trump cards before Yue Weiwei eventually surrendered.

While these battles were going on, Lin Yun started to refine the flame dragon blood essence. His vitality surged like a volcano as the azure dragon energy devoured the blood essence. His body had become so hot that he had no choice but to circulate the Iris Sword Sutra to suppress the heat. If he didn’t do this, he had no idea what kind of commotion he would cause.

If he reached the Azure Dragon Enneaform’s Nonaform, he would be able to use dragon breath. Initially, Lin Yun didn’t think he would reach this level during the banquet, but Yan Long’zi gave him a huge gift. If the dragon runes on his body continued to grow, he might really reach the nonaform.

The next battle created a commotion as Yu Haotian and Zhu Qingshan stood on the stage. Zhu Qingshan hadn’t suffered a single loss so far, meaning Yu Haotian was his first true test.

Yu Haotian and Zhu Qingshan bowed to each other before they fought. Then, Zhu Qingshan took the opportunity to attack first, pushing his movement technique to the limit. The black blade that he wielded emitted black miasma across the stage. With his blade, Zhu Qingshan looked like an asura from hell. Finally, pushing his saber intent to the limit, he swung his blade.

Zhu Qingshan disappeared with a black flash. When he reappeared, his demonic aura manifested into a demon that had a nasty howl. Yu Haotian was at the center of the howl and a purple light tried to pierce his body. Zhu Qingshan stood by, ready to chop Yu Haotian if he was distracted even for a split second.

“Heaven and Earth Union!” Yu Haotian clenched his fist together and threw out a punch. He easily shattered the demonic aura in the air, which made the demon miserably howl and vanish. When his punch clashed with Zhu Qingshan’s blade, Zhu Qingshan was nearly blown off the stage.

“Overlord Fist!”

“It’s the Overlord Fist! Heaven and Earth Union again! What exactly is the limit of this fist?”

“Isn’t he a little too terrifying? Is he going to sweep through the banquet with this one punch?” Everyone’s faces had changed because Yu Haotian had used this move several times now.

“He’s too strong.” Even the other participants in the top ten had shock in their eyes when they saw this scene.

“Soul Devour!” Zhu Qingshan wasn’t too shocked by Yu Haotian. His blade unleashed over ninety dark rays as his saber intent spread out. His blades manifested another demon that emitted a dazzling dark light. At this moment, the entire stage was enveloped by Zhu Qingshan’s shocking blade light.

“Interesting.” Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed with interest because there was something unusual about this attack. If someone stared at the attack, they would be hypnotized by the blade light and end up neglecting the demon.

But it was a pity that he was Yu Haotian. He didn’t even need to move as wisps of black miasma left his body. He easily resolved Zhu Qingshan’s attack without showing any effort.

“Again!” Yu Haotian used two fingers to clamp onto Zhu Qingshan’s saber. The saber was like an illusion as it wasn’t as strong as everyone thought it was. Since it lacked strength, Yu Haotian could stop this attack with just two fingers. However, the crowd didn’t know this, so they were shocked. Yu Haotian truly fought like a king that stepped over everything and everyone.

“Blood Devour!” Under the demon mask, Zhu Qingshan’s face became sinister as he attacked once more. This time around, he unleashed countless black threads towards Yu Haotian. Bai Lixuan’s face changed as he recalled how terrifying this attack was. He clearly remembered blocking this attack, but the black threads still devoured one-tenth of his blood. If this didn’t happen, he believed that he wouldn’t have lost.

“Terranean Overlord Fist!” Yu Haotian’s gaze turned grave as he unleashed the Overlord Fist’s second form. All of the black threads suddenly stopped when they were ten meters away from Yu Haotian. No matter how much they struggled, they couldn’t get to his fist.

Then, the black threads exploded into dust. Yu Haotian had no thoughts of probing Zhu Qingshan and bested him with absolute strength.

“Impressive, even I can’t see through that attack. If I remember correctly, you still have another attack. Let’s continue,” said Yu Haotian calmly.

“You won,” said Zhu Qingshan. He had no intention of continuing. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Hearing the response, Yu Haotian shrugged, “What a pity. I’m really interested in seeing the third attack that you’ve been hiding. It doesn’t matter anymore though. I guess this banquet will be boring too.”

After devouring Zhu Qingshan’s profound amber aura, Yu Haotian’s dragon projection grew a fifth claw. When Zhu Qingshan looked at Yu Haotian’s figure from afar, his brows furrowed under his mask. Is it really impossible to defeat Yu Haotian?
