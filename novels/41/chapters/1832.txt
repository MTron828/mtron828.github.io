Chapter 1833 - One Sword

The Fire God General had a strong stance, ridiculing all the geniuses in the Eastern Desolation when he opened his mouth. Not to mention he even claimed that he could destroy the barrier.

This instantly made everyone feel uncertain because they had no idea what the Fire God General was planning. When everyone’s gazes fell onto the Fire God General, their attention was shifted away from Lin Yun.

“Wait.” But just when the Fire God General was about to make a move, Kou Tianhua suddenly stood out.

“What’s the matter? You want to have the honor of doing it?” The Fire God General said with a playful smile.

“Since the Fire God General is willing to make a move, the barrier is naturally not an issue for you, and I don’t think anyone can compete with you over the Black Thunder Saint Canon. But before that, allow me to kill someone.” Kou Tianhua said indifferently.

“Who is it?”

“Nirvana Banquet’s champion, Lin Xiao.” Kou Tianhua coldly said, his voice causing an uproar in the surrounding area.

“I won’t compete with you for the Black Thunder Saint Canon, but I want his head!” Kou Tianhua said.

The Fire God General didn’t say a word, but the two other God Generals’ faces changed because they recalled how they were defeated by Lin Yun at the Martial Dao Tea Party. If Lin Yun didn’t appear, they wouldn’t have suffered such humiliation at the hands of the Autumn Mountain Lord.

If it wasn’t for Lin Yun, they wouldn’t have become a laughingstock at the Martial Dao Tea Party and be punished when they got back. This was the reason why they wanted to kill Lin Yun when they saw him.

As the Fire God General’s eyes flickered, he smiled, “You can kill him if you have the ability. You don’t have to report to me. The Blood Moon Sect also can’t use the Demonfeather Order!”

“Big Brother, there’s no need for you to give him to Kou Tianhua. I can easily crush him with a hand.” Ao Feng gritted his teeth. He and Yan Cangming were filled with hatred for Lin Yun.

“There’s no need to hurry. He’s just an insignificant character.” The Fire God General said, sweeping his gaze through the crowd. No one knew what he was thinking.

Kou Tianhua charged towards Lin Yun, along with Yuan Hengying and Lady Stone. The three were at the Profound Life Stage, especially Kou Tianhua, who was at the fifth stage Profound life Stage, with his name on the Demonic Ranking.

Everyone’s expressions became nervous. The three God Generals and the holy land geniuses watched as Kou Tianhua’s party slowly approached Lin Yun. Even with Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng around, it was practically impossible for them to protect Lin Yun.

In the end, the Black Tortoise Void Sea wasn’t something Lin Yun, who was at the Dragon Pulse Realm, could barge in on. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be in this awkward situation.

“Lin Xiao, you leave first.” Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi’s faces changed, but they didn’t hesitate to stand before Lin Yun.

“No need. I’ll face them myself.” Lin Yun stepped forth after whispering to An Liuyan’s ears. When he stepped forth, he faced Kou Tianhua’s group of three alone.

“Lin Xiao, it’s time for us to settle the score between us.” Kou Tianhua indifferently looked at Lin Yun.

“I won’t stop you if you’re courting death.” Lin Yun said without an expression on his face. Kou Tianhua’s group of three was already starting to get on his nerves, and a murderous aura began to accumulate within his pupils. If Kou Tianhua remained alive, there would be an endless amount of people trying to come for his head because of the Demonfeather Order.

The surrounding voices died down, and their gazes fell onto Lin Yun. The three God Generals were also feeling uncertain because of Lin Yun’s arrogant words. After all, this wasn’t the Martial Dao Tea Party and everyone here in the Black Tortoise Void Sea had a higher cultivation than him.

“You’re courting death!” Yuan Hengying behind Kou Tianhua said, and his hand reached out. When a crimson radiance burst from him, he already arrived before Lin Yun, wanting to suppress him with a wave of his hand.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He was at the fourth stage Profound Life Stage. When his profound life aura empowered his dragon origin, this allowed his dragon origin to reach a terrifying height. He also had a swift speed and quickly reached Lin Yun in the blink of an eye. His palm was enveloped in crimson radiance, and his dragon origin became violent. If his hand really descended, no one doubted that the power of this attack could easily take Lin Yun’s life.

As a dragon roar echoed from within Lin Yun’s body, one hundred and ten thousand golden-purple dragon runes left his body and easily shattered the crimson palm. In the next second, the dragon runes condensed into an azure dragon shrouded in a thunderstorm and enveloped Lin Yun, sending Yuan Hengying flying away.

The azure dragon gave off an immense pressure and this shocked everyone at the Black Thunder Saint Palace. Yuan Hengying’s face also changed, and a saint blade appeared in his hand with a flip of his wrist. But when Lin Yun flicked his finger, a powerful sword ray flew out, empowered by the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

“What a powerful sword intent!” Everyone was shocked. They knew that Lin Yun had grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, but they didn’t expect he would have such a powerful secret technique. They instantly had a feeling that the mark on the back of Lin Yun’s hand probably had a huge origin.

Lady Stone’s face changed, and she wanted to take a step forth. But the moment she moved, a sword ray knocked her back and nine sword rays flew over just when she wanted to retaliate.

She immediately waved her hands in a panic, and quickly retreated, being forced to take several steps back. On the other hand, Lin Yun didn’t even move a single step right from the beginning.

This made Yuan Hengying’s face sink, and he charged forth once more. But the moment he moved, Lin Yun flicked his finger with his left hand. As boundless sword intent condensed into a sword ray, it flew out and shattered the space its path. This caught Yuan Hengying by surprise and he took several steps back.

Just by flicking his fingers, Lin Yun forced Yuan Hengying and Lady Stone back. This naturally made them feel aggrieved, and they were forced back whenever they wanted to charge forth.

Everyone in the surroundings naturally noticed that something wasn’t right. Lin Yun might only seem to be at the Dragon Pulse Realm, but his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent wasn’t something that could be grasped with his cultivation. Under his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, Yuan Hengying and Lady Stone couldn’t get close to him, no matter how they tried.

Unless both of them could forcibly break through Lin Yun’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent and shatter it, they would only take a one-sided beating. There was also a possibility that they had to wait till Lin Yun exhausts his sword intent. But Lin Yun seemed to handle them with ease, so they could only dream about that possibility. Putting it in a nutshell, it wasn’t hard to accomplish it.

Suddenly, a massive white bone hand appeared, blocking the incoming sword rays. When the sword rays clashed with the white bone hand, it caused an explosion and it only took a split second for the white bone hand to be blown into countless fragments. But the white bone hand had successfully blocked the incoming sword rays. It was Kou Tianhua who finally made a move, and this naturally made Yuan Hengying and Lady Stone feel relieved.

“Impressive.” Kou Tianhua gritted his teeth.

Lin Yun let go of his hands and said, “It’s nothing. But it’s more than enough to kill you.”

Kou Tianhua smiled, “These pitiful tricks might be able to deal with others, but do you think these pitiful tricks can deal with me? You can’t even protect yourself, and you want to kill me? How impudent!”

Everyone nodded their heads and didn’t feel anything wrong with what Kou Tianhua said. In their view, the sword intent released by Lin Yun was extraordinary, but it would only make others feel unreal. They all felt that Lin Yun would lose terribly if he faced a real expert, such as Kou Tianhua.

As long as Kou Tianhua could block the incoming Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, he could easily inflict serious injuries on Lin Yun with just one strike based on his cultivation at the fifth stage Profound Life Stage. This was because Lin Yun had grasped the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. If it was someone else at the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, one strike was all Kou Tianhua needed to kill them.

“Come and try it, then. I only need one sword to kill you.” Lin Yun waved his hand and the Flower Burial Sword appeared in his hand, drawing it out. Donned in his blue robe, this only made him seem even more unfathomable.

“Others might be afraid of your Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, but not me!” Kou Tianhua coldly said, carrying a slender saint blade behind him. He was qualified to say those words, due to his cultivation, not to mention he was the disciple of the Whitebone Blade Saint. His blade intent had long reached the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Blade Intent.

As soon as he finished, he drifted forward. This was a bizarre movement technique because his body seemed agile, and he didn’t leave behind any afterimages in his path. At the same time, a powerful killing intent spread out that made everyone feel a chill run down their spines. Even when he disappeared from everyone’s sight, they could still sense his murderous aura.

Lin Yun drew his sword, and Kou Tianhua was forced to show himself under the sword ray.

As the Flower Burial Sword vibrated, Kou Tianhua’s hand was like a bone hand as he used two fingers to clamp onto Lin Yun’s sword. He coldly said, “Doesn’t look impressive after all.”

This scene made An Liuyan and Mei Zihua, who were not too far away, have a drastic change on their faces, and they quickly became nervous. But Gu Jun gulped down a mouthful of wine before he murmured in confusion, “Did I make a mistake?”

Everyone took a deep breath because they didn’t even see how Lin Yun drew his sword. But not only did Kou Tianhua clearly see it, he even easily caught Lin Yun’s sword. If the trajectory of a swordsman’s sword was seen through by others and couldn’t be pulled back in time, there was no difference from a death sentence, not to mention Lin Yun was facing Kou Tianhua.

Looking aloof, Kou Tianhua scoffed, “So what if you have the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent? I don’t even need to draw my blade to deal with you, and you want to kill me?”

All of a sudden, Lin Yun did something that no one had expected. He released his grip on the sword and took a step back. As the Flower Burial Sword lightly shook in the air, Lin Yun indifferently said, “You’re already dead.”

The moment he was done speaking, blood began to splash out from Kou Tianhua’s chest. Kou Tianhua’s face was terrifyingly pale, and he muttered, “H-How is this possible…”

“It only takes a sword for me to kill you.” Lin Yun said indifferently.

At this moment, Kou Tianhua finally realized what happened. Lin Yun had executed two swords, and he only managed to catch the second. The first sword had already stabbed him, shattering his heart and wanting to claim his life. This instantly made Kou Tianhua furious, and he drew his blade from his back, “I’ll kill you!”

Lin Yun took a step forth to grab onto the Flower Burial Sword and swung his sword down. A decapitated head then fell to the ground. Kou Tianhua’s head was like a ball rolling on the ground until it reached Yuan Hengtian and Lady Stone.

But Lin Yun didn’t sheath his sword, but had a thunderstorm explode around him. When he divided into two, the two of him swung his sword, executing the Azure Dragon Sword Art—Unrivaled•Thunderstorm Slash.

The two sword rays intertwined to form a cross and landed on the screen covering the Black Thunder Saint Palace, and the lightning runes on the barrier became dim. By the time Lin Yun sheathed his sword, the screen shattered.

“He’s right. My sword can shatter the screen, and you guys can give it a try if you don’t believe it.” Lin Yun swept his gaze over the cultivators of the Demonic Ranking before his gaze ultimately fell onto Yu Wenxiu.

The surroundings fell into a dead silence following his words, and everyone still hadn’t recovered from their shock.
