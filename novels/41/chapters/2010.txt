Chapter 2011 - Swift Defeat

The Blood Crow Ancestor was focused on treating its injuries. His arm had grown back out. The surface of his body was covered in crimson bones with golden runes engraved on the bones, and the toughness was even stronger than saint artifacts.

Ordinary saint artifacts wouldn’t be able to leave a mark on it, not to mention that the Blood Crow Ancestor had a powerful recovery ability and was a lot stronger than a human cultivator’s saint physique. But the bones covering the surface of his body were covered in cracks with blood seeping out. Sword intent was lingering on the wounds, and he would be in pain whenever he moved.

Even if he had a powerful recovery ability, he couldn’t eliminate the Astral Sword Intent within the wounds. Whenever he recovered his injuries, the sword intent would erupt and increase his injuries. The Blood Crow Ancestor used his saint aura to expel the sword intent, but the effects weren’t good.

He wasn’t proficient in martial techniques, and this meant he didn’t have a cultivation technique. Thus, his usage of his saint aura was rather crude.

Right then, two figures appeared. When the Blood Crow Ancestor opened his eyes and saw the two people, rage blazed within his pupils. He got up, pointed at Lin Yun, and roared, “You despicable rat! Do you really think that I can’t do anything to you?!”

He was furious because Lin Yun had been coming over every few days, taking out the umbrella and leaving whenever he couldn’t hold on any longer. Whenever Lin Yun came, he would be stronger, and the Astral Sword Intent that Lin Yun left within his body would increase. After a few fights, the Blood Crow Ancestor finally realized that Lin Yun was using him as a sparing partner. He couldn’t even sleep well during this period, not to mention cultivate.

Bai Qingyu was trembling in fear and didn’t dare to speak. She had no idea what Lin Yun had done in the past few days for the Blood Crow Ancestor to be so furious.

“Here’s the Natal Yin Saint Physique that you need. I’ve brought her to you,” Lin Yun said.

The Blood Crow Ancestor squinted his pupils, stepping forward and appearing ten meters away from Lin Yun. When he got close, the baleful aura and Quasi-Saint’s aura he gave off made Bai Qingyu tremble. The Blood Crow Ancestor was excited when he saw Bai Qingyu, but he became cautious and asked, “It’s really the Natal Yin Saint Physique! You’re that good-hearted?”

He had fought Lin Yun several times, and knew how cunning Lin Yun was.

Lin Yun merely replied with a smile.

“Hehe, at least you kept your promise this time. I’m a man of my word, and I’ll tell you the clues of the Udumbara Flower!” The Blood Crow Ancestor smiled and wanted to reach out to Bai Qingyu.

This scared Bai Qingyu into closing her eyes, and her legs began to tremble.

But Lin Yun responded faster and held onto the Blood Crow Ancestor’s wrist. He said, “You’re only allowed to look at her. No touching.”

The Blood Crow Ancestor became furious and glared at Lin Yun, “You fooled me!”

“No, I’m here to kill you,” Lin Yun said indifferently. As dragon runes began to pour into his hand, his hand became similar to a dragon’s claw while firmly grasping the Blood Crow Ancestor’s wrist.

The Blood Crow Ancestor tried to struggle free, but it was shocked to discover that it couldn’t break free from Lin Yun’s grasp. Lin Yun was giving off a dragon aura, which made the Blood Crow Ancestor feel like he was facing a genuine Divine Dragon, not a human.

The Blood Crow Ancestor sneered, “Hahaha, did you really think that I didn’t let you grab me on purpose?”

When he was done speaking, he grabbed Lin Yun’s wrist before gathering his saint aura into his other hand, wanting to execute a palm at Lin Yun. But the moment he moved, this entire land of bones was brightly lit by a sword ray and the Flower Burial Sword traveled from a thousand miles away, targeting the Blood Crow Ancestor’s back with Astral Sword Intent.

“Let go!” The Blood Crow Ancestor’s face changed, and he roared, “Otherwise, we’ll both die together!”

“Don’t be so sure about that,” Lin Yun said.

“Blooming Nether Orchid!” Nether Orchids bloomed as Bai Qingyu, terrified a moment ago, opened her eyes. There wasn’t a hint of fear in her pupils. Rather, her pupils were filled with calm, decisiveness, and resolution. It was as though she had changed into an entirely different person.

When the Nether Orchids bloomed, Bai Qingyu drew out the Stalewater Sword. The Blood Crow Ancestor’s arm was severed as blood splashed, and Lin Yun threw the broken arm away. After he dodged the incoming attack, he reached out with his five fingers, grabbing onto the Flower Burial Sword that had pierced the Blood Crow Ancestor’s heart before launching his attack with an even faster speed.

Twelve afterimages flew out from him, surrounding the Blood Crow Ancestor, each swinging a sword. Each sword would leave a hole in the Blood Crow Ancestor’s body, making the latter scream out in pain, his vision blurred by the afterimages.

“Myriad Swords Unite!” The afterimages overlapped, and Lin Yun swung a sword, drawing a circle in the air.

As blood gushed out from the Blood Crow Ancestor’s neck, he looked at Lin Yun with horror. He muttered, “This is impossible… I clearly have the saint aura to protect myself…”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He couldn’t figure out how this young man became so strong in just ten-odd days. Regardless of this guy’s cultivation or sword intent, the improvements had shocked him. If it was in the past, the young man couldn't have inflicted any injuries on him. But the young man managed to accomplish it, which was unimaginable.

He didn’t hesitate to turn into a crimson streak of light, flying back to the grave. But he slammed against a wall and was sent a few hundred meters back. When the Blood Crow Ancestor raised his head, he saw a giant Ancient Dracoape in his path.

“Dracoape?” Before the Blood Crow Ancestor could respond, the Ancient Dracoape sent him flying with a slap. His eyes instantly reddened, and the Blood Crow Ancestor finally lost his temper. Sins began to appear within his golden pupils as a black miasma with a horrifyingly baleful energy swept out from him as his strength rose.

“All of you will die!” The Blood Crow Ancestor’s body began to wriggle, and the aura he gave off grew increasingly terrifying.

“None of us will die today,” Lin Yun said. A silver beam descended from the sky as Lil’ Purple’s palm fell on the Blood Crow Ancestor’s forehead when the latter was about to perform some sort of secret technique.

Lil’ Purple looked prideful as the crimson and golden runes on her forehead began to glow. With a crack, the Blood Crow Ancestor’s connection to the grave had been severed, and the Blood Crow Ancestor’s body began to shrivel like a popped balloon.

It didn’t take long for the Blood Crow Ancestor’s body to become bony, and his saint aura had disappeared. The Blood Crow Ancestor looked at Lil’ Purple with horror because his saint path was severed with a palm. He asked, “W-Who the hell are you…? Why is my Quasi-Saint Realm cultivation gone…?”

“Listen well, I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!” Lil’ Purple hovered in the air as her silver hair draped down with the runes shining on her forehead.

“That was sick!” Bai Qingyu’s eyes shone with splendor as she looked at Lil’ Purple.

The Blood Crow Ancestor was left dumbfounded when he heard Lil’ Purple’s introduction. He tried to look around and discovered he had nowhere to run. Most importantly, his cultivation at the Quasi-Saint Realm was gone, which put him in despair. He looked at Lil’ Purple with a resentful gaze before he roared, “Don’t even think about getting any information about the Udumbara Flower out of me!”

“A small bird like you dares to act with such cockiness in front of me? Do you believe that I don’t have a hundred ways to make you speak?” Lil’ Purple replied in disdain.

“I won’t say anything even if you kill me,” the Blood Crow Ancestor said coldly. He wasn’t even afraid of death now, so what would he have to be afraid of?

“Still trying to be stubborn? I’ll let you experience it, then.” Lil’ Purple turned to look at Lin Yun and said, “Treat his injuries.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he came forth, circulating the Blue Dragon Bone and injecting the energy from the Divine Dragon Bone into the Blood Crow Ancestor’s body.

But when the energy was injected into his body, the sins in his body began to react violently and rampaged within his body, causing the Blood Crow Ancestor to scream out in pain. He didn’t even last fifteen minutes before begging, “Please forgive me. I’ll speak! Just spare me!”
