Chapter 1058 - Returning To The Forbidden Realm

“Is Lin Yun injured?”

“He’s probably badly injured. Otherwise the Realm Sons wouldn’t have gone as far as using the Nirvana Pellet. Clearly, they must be confident in killing him.”

“Will Lin Yun be able to reach Four Phase City?”

“If he really manages to make it to Four Phase City, the Nirvana Pellets would have been a waste.” The pursuit of all the Realm Sons instantly caused discussions to break out in Wind Mound City.

Everyone was surprised because Lin Yun was very imposing when he slapped the Nether Divinity Realm Son. They had no doubt that Lin Yun could make it to Four Phase City. But now that Lin Yun showed weakness, they weren’t sure if Lin Yun would make it out alive.

Outside Wind Mound City, Lin Yun’s face was pale as he clutched his chest. Blood flowed out of his lips as he was in the worst condition of his life. He had never felt so weak before.

He was surprised after sensing a terrifying gaze from afar that shattered his sky sword intent. The look was strong enough to leave fine cracks on his meridians, which gave him heavy injuries.

Was that an Empyrean or a Divine Core Expert? Lin Yun could tell that he encountered an existence so strong that he had no way of resisting. If the existence was willing, they could have killed Lin Yun. He deduced that the gaze originated from Four Phase City, so he needed to leave as soon as possible. Suddenly, Lin Yun couldn’t hold back his pain anymore as he threw up blood and fell to one knee.

“It’s that old fellow again!” Yue Weiwei raised her head with cold killing intent flashing in her pupils. Right at this moment, the gaze disappeared.

“Was he the one who acted against you?” Knowing Yue Weiwei’s strength, Lin Yun knew that there was no way the Realm Sons could have captured her.

“Yeah, he’s an elder of the Profound Sky Sect who came from the Nether Divinity War Realm,” said Yue Weiwei.

“I see, but there’s a limit to how much he can interfere. Otherwise, I would be dead,” analyzed Lin Yun.

The elders of the powerful sects were basically judges who were responsible for the test in the Heavenly Path. Logically speaking, they had to be impartial. But clearly, this elder had been taking care of the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

Then again, this didn’t mean that the elder could act recklessly. If he did, others would discover his interference. So he could only use his gaze to destroy Lin Yun’s sword intent, which caused Lin Yun’s sword intent to suffer a backlash. Although his injuries were serious, it still wasn’t enough to take his life. The method was extremely subtle, so there were no traces of inference. Since it was easy for elders to interfere, the Realm Sons had no reason to be afraid in the Heavenly Path.

Lin Yun felt a little helpless. So what if he was strong? He still couldn’t deal with the shameless old geezer hiding in the background. It was the case for Yue Weiwei and it was the same for him.

“Hahaha! Lin Yun, kneel and beg for death. I can consider giving you an easy death!” A burst of laughter sounded out from Wind Mound City. At the same time, several powerful auras were bolting over.

“The Nirvana Pellet?” Yue Weiwei turned around and looked at the Nether Divinity Realm Son who was faintly enveloped by a phoenix.

“How extravagant.” Lin Yun had also heard of the Nirvana Pellet. A single Nirvana Pellet was equivalent to an extra life. As long as someone wasn’t dead, they could instantly recover with the pellet and become stronger than before.

The Realm Sons instantly charged out of the Windmound City and chased Lin Yun down. All three of them were emitting a terrifying aura as they stared at Lin Yun.

“We can’t let them get away!”

“He has to die today no matter what!” Ferocious roars echoed out as a ray of light arrived with immense pressure. The Nether Divinity Realm Son had appeared and was unleashing his phoenix holy spirit from within his body, “Flaming Firmament Phoenix!”

The immense pressure descended and enveloped Lil’ Red. When the pressure descended, space seemed to be restricted, which caused Lil’ Red to slow down.

“You’re courting death!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son pushed his palm out as the flame phoenix flapped its wings. He manifested a sea of flames that gathered into a terrifying vortex. Then, his colossal palm descended towards Lil’ Red.

Lin Yun’s eyes blazed with flames as he made a fist with his right hand. Not only did he fully exhaust all his vitality, but he was also heavily injured from the backlash of his sword intent. The meridians in his body were a mess right now, so he couldn’t even circulate his origin energy.

His injuries were so bad that he didn’t have the means to properly fight. The elder from the Profound Sky Sect was too profound and only destroyed Lin Yun’s sword intent. However, the backlash of Lin Yun’s sword intent made all of his injuries several times worse.

Right at this moment, Lil’ Red turned around and threw a punch. The punch was so strong that it caused blood to drip from the corner of the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s lips. He was heavily injured by Lil’ Red’s attack, but the Nether Divinity Realm Son managed to slow Lil’ Red down even more.

“Are you alright?” The Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons looked at the Nether Divinity Realm Son as they rushed over.

“I’m fine. That beast’s injuries are even heavier than mine. Chase after them!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son smiled sinisterly.

Lil’ Red gasped for his air as the violent aura it was releasing gradually dissipated. At this moment, it could no longer maintain its dracoape form.

Seeing that the Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons were about to arrive, Yue Weiwei said, “Big Brother Yun, we won’t be able to make it to Four Phase City.”

Lin Yun was stunned when he realized what Yue Weiwei was saying. Based on his current condition, if the Nether Divinity Realm Son had laid an ambush on the way to Four Phase City, they wouldn’t make it.

If we can’t make it to Four Phase City, where should we go? Suddenly, a light flashed through Lin Yun’s eyes as he said, “Lil’ Red, return to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.”

A torrential dragon aura burst out of Lil’ Red as it turned into its warhorse form. The Realm Sons unleashed their attacks to keep Lin Yun behind, but Lil’ Red was too fast. After transforming into the warhorse, it easily dodged the incoming attacks.

“Damn it!” The Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Son cursed. Lil’ Red was clearly heavily injured, but it still managed to evade them. Just like that, seven days passed in the blink of an eye.

During this period of time, Lin Yun couldn’t catch his breath at all. Whenever his injuries got a little better, he would be forced to face the Realm Sons. Additionally, his injuries were getting worse with each day.

Everyone was exhausted, especially Lin Yun. His lips had become pale and he couldn’t open his eyes anymore. His consciousness even began to blur while he lay in Yue Weiwei’s embrace. He kept getting weaker.

Yue Weiwei bit her lips as she looked at the bracelet on her wrist several times. Due to her brightly colored personality, she could smile even in the worst scenario. But when she looked at the heavily injured Lin Yun at this moment, she was so anxious that she didn’t even notice the heavy concern on her face.

“Lil’ Red, faster!” Yue Weiwei called out to Lil’ Red. They needed to keep going because the Realm Sons were still chasing after them. Three days ago, the Realm Sons almost managed to stop Lil’ Red, but Lin Yun drew his sword and pushed back two of the Realm Sons. Because of Lin Yun, they were able to persevere.

When Lil’ Red finally brought Yue Weiwei and Lin Yun to a familiar plaza, they could see the entrance to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. Yue Weiwei was puzzled because it was an entrance to a secret realm, but the entrance was no longer stable. If they went in, they might not be able to come out again.

“Go in.” Yue Weiwei struggled for a while, but she ultimately decided to try the gate. After all, it was Lin Yun’s decision and she trusted him completely. Just like that, they entered the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. When they entered, the flaming gate became dimmer as if it would collapse at any moment.

“To the forbidden region.” Lin Yun forced his eyes open as soon as they entered the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. The forbidden region was naturally the place where Yu Haotian had died. Since the three Realm Sons wanted to take his life, he would drag them down with him.

Outside the palace, the Realm Sons wore perplexed looks. They stared at the dim gate wondering what to do. However, the Nether Divinity Realm Son had no hesitation as he charged in, “Chase after them no matter where they go! We have to personally ensure his death!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons also hesitated briefly before they charged into the gate.
