Chapter 890 - Doubt

Aside from the plaza, all the buildings in the center region had collapsed. The tremor only lasted for a second, but the light was enough to cause a huge uproar.

Even as the culprit, Lin Yun was dumbfounded as exhaustion overtook him. As he recovered, his heartbeat calmed down. Looking at the mess before him, Lin Yun muttered, “I seem to have forgotten to suppress the power behind this sword…”

He couldn’t be blamed for not being cautious. Unlike Lightning Cocoon, Azure Lotus required him to be imposing. In order to do so, he had to use his full strength.

If his aura was slightly weaker, it would be impossible for him to swing his sword. Lin Yun casually walked around the field that his sword ruined. The ground was littered with craters.

“How terrifying…if it weren’t for the Dragon City’s protection, just how destructive would this attack be?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts as interest flashed in his eyes. The attack was a lot stronger than he had imagined.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He had a feeling that he could cut down everyone in his path.

When he recovered his origin energy, Lin Yun started to comprehend the third and final form of the Three Heavenly Divides. The third form was named Solaris Lunar and it would unleash a sword as bright as the sun and moon. But it was different for him because he intended to use his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra to manifest the sun while his Iris Sword Sutra manifested the moon.

Since he could cultivate two sword sutras at the same time, he naturally had to bring out their full potential. If Senior Jian Wuya could also cultivate two sword sutras back then, he would most likely have the same thoughts as Lin Yun. There was naturally no way using his thunderstorm sword energy was comparable to using two sword sutras. On top of that, it was even easier to use this method.

After all, Lin Yun had cultivated both Azure Firmament Sword Sutra and Iris Sword Sutra to a high stage. So he naturally had a lot of practice in them.

Sitting down on the field, Lin Yun started circulating both his sword sutras. The Azure Firmament Tree appeared behind him as the Iris Flower petals decorated the branches. At the same time, he started altering the sutra of the Azure Firmament Thirteen Swords.

It didn’t take long for the Azure Firmament Tree to transform into a sun while the Iris Flower petals converged into an icy cold moon.

After circulating the Azure Firmament Thirteen Swords several times, a scene suddenly appeared in Lin Yun’s mind of a sun and moon. He was currently seeing the phenomenon created by Jian Wuya for his successor to observe. Otherwise, it would be impossible for his successor to comprehend the true essence of the sword technique that he created.

In the scene, the sun and moon started revolving above Jian Wuya into two massive vortexes. When Jian Wuya swung his sword, everything melted like snow.

This scene had completely left Lin Yun dumbfounded because he could only see Jian Wuya’s blurred figure. Additionally, he felt as though he was enveloped in an ocean. Just how terrifying was his sword intent to create such a phenomenon?

Then, the scene soon cracked into pieces as Jian Wuya’s blurred figure spoke, “In the sky above Azure Firmament, lightning and wind exist at the same time.”

When the scene disappeared, Jian Wuya’s words lingered in Lin Yun’s mind. He knew he couldn’t give up on the thunderstorm energy after merging two of his sword sutras. Otherwise, it would be impossible to create a sun and a moon.

After an entire day and night, Lin Yun opened his eyes with light flashing in his pupils. In the next second, Lin Yun executed the Azure Dragon Enneaform with dragon runes that started to wriggle on the surface of his body. When the thunderstorm energy reached its limit, Lin Yun leapt into the sky and stabbed his sword out.

In that split second, the sun and moon flew out of his body as sunlight and moonlight both gathered onto his sword. When he stabbed his sword out, he created a huge hole in the ancient restriction on the field.

After he finished, he deeply sighed. He had already learned his lesson and held the full power of his sword back. “Azure Lotus only created some cracks, but Solaris Lunar actually created a huge hole.”

If he wasn’t holding back, the power behind his sword might destroy the restriction covering the field. At this moment, he had also finally learned the three killing moves. Or rather, the Three Heavenly Divides fully belonged to him. Even if others had the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra and Azure Firmament Thirteen Sword, there was no way they could practice his Three Heavenly Divdes. These forms would be his great sort of reliance in the Heavenly Path.

Simultaneously, seven days had also passed. Lin Yun rested in the field briefly before he came out. When he came out to see all the buildings in ruins, he was utterly shocked. Only the Divine Dragon Statue stood tall.

“This wasn’t my fault, right?” Lin Yun muttered softly. He remembered that he didn’t hold back with the Azure Lotus and created a huge commotion.

“Lin Yun!” Right at this moment, Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan felt relieved when they saw Lin Yun.

Lin Yun only understood their worry after they explained that a bizarre light suddenly shot out of the ground last night. It enveloped half the city and the Divine Dragon Statue. Many people were still buried underground and trapped.

Some people thought that a treasure was emerging and started searching the entire city. But in the end, all of their efforts went down the drain.

Hearing that, Lin Yun sneered inwardly because he knew that it was probably caused by his Azure Lotus and not a treasure.

“Additionally, news of the Glorysun Spirit has spread out in Thunderflame City. Many people know that the Glorysun Spirit is emerging soon. However, no one knows the exact date. It looks like Qin Feng had concealed it on purpose.” Fang Shaoyu wore a grave expression and continued, “You have to be careful when working together with them.”

Lin Yun nodded his head because he naturally knew that. Seven days ago, Lin Yun felt pressure. However, his cultivation had stabilized and he also had the Three Heavenly Divides. So how could a pinnacle first soul Heavenly Soul Realm threaten him? But it was a pity that he didn’t have enough time to make a breakthrough in his spiritual sword intent. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even fear the geniuses from the higher realms.

“Lin Yun, you have to go because of the Gold Lightflow Lamp. As for us, we’ll stay in Thunderflame City for the time being because we’re too weak to help you. We’ll try and search for greater fortune cultivation techniques in the nearby runes. If we can get through the tribulation, perhaps we might meet again at the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm,” said Fang Shaoyu in a grave tone.

It was time for them to part. The moment Lin Yun killed Feng Xuan, he had outgrown his fellow brothers. They knew that they couldn’t follow Lin Yun’s footsteps anymore. But this was the Heavenly Path. As long as they had enough courage, they would surely meet again in the future.

Nodding his head, Lin Yun replied, “It might not be that hard to find greater fortune martial techniques. Take care of yourselves. We’ll meet again at the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.”

“Take care. Let us meet again at the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.”

The Heavenly Path was a place filled with brutal competition where the strong preyed on the weak. The only ones he could trust were the friends he came with from the Profound Amber Realm. However, Lin Yun had no idea if they would meet again in the future.

On Thunderflame City’s wall, Qin Feng and Yan Kui were waiting. Additionally, there were two more first soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts with several geniuses with tribulation qualifications around them.

Lin Yun was surprised when he came over because there were quite a few people qualified for their tribulation. However, they only had four first soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts and were probably weaker than the other dragon cities.

“Lin Yun, if you didn’t show up just now, we would have thought that you were trapped underground,” joked Qin Feng when he saw Lin Yun.

“He is the one who killed Feng Xuan?” A voice sounded out. It was youth standing beside two Heavenly Soul Realm experts. When he looked at Lin Yun, his eyes were filled with pride and doubt.

When Lin Yun glanced at the youth, he could roughly tell that these people came from the same realm. Their realm should be stronger than Qin Feng and Yan Kui since they had two first soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts. Although the youth who spoke only had tribulation qualifications, his aura was just as strong as Qin Feng’s.

“Let me introduce you guys. These two are the leaders of Highcloud Realm, Chen Xuan and Sui Yu,” smiled Qin Feng.

The two first soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts nodded their heads and pointed at the blue-clothed youth standing between them, “This is Liu Yun. He has the strongest talent in the Highcloud Realm and is also a swordsman like you. Half a month ago, he had successfully comprehended spiritual sword intent. His strength isn’t any weaker than us.”

Oh? Lin Yun now understood why Liu Yun was targeting him. It turns out that they were both geniuses who had grasped spiritual sword intent before reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm.
