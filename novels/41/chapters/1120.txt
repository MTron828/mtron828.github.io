Chapter 1121 - Definitely Taking Revenge

The entire hall was terrifyingly quiet as everyone looked at Lin Yun with sympathy in their eyes. They all knew that Lin Yun was a genius, but it was a pity that he ran into Yan Teng. It was unreasonable for Yan Teng to humiliate Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun wasn’t even in the Empyrean Realm. Just thinking about it made everyone shiver.

“Don’t you think you’re a little too much?” Lin Yun questioned while suppressing his rage. He didn’t want to start unnecessary fights as he was only staying in the Profound Azure Manor for a year. He didn’t want to involve himself in the grudges between the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and the other sects. But it seemed like others were determined to involve him.

“Do I, Yan Teng, need you to teach me?” Yan Teng thought that Lin Yun was afraid and sneered, “I naturally have no grudges with you, but I want to give some guidance to someone from the younger generation. If you don’t give me any face, don’t blame me for not giving you any face.”

Xuan Fei laughed, “Brother Yan, why are you wasting your time with him? Lin Yun, either kneel or fight. Show us you’re a real man. Didn’t Brother Yan say that he would only use half of his strength? Don’t tell me that you don’t have any courage.”

The other disciples smiled bitterly when they heard that because Yan Teng and his group were really shameless. Yan Teng was already in the Galaxy Stage, so even if he only used half of his strength, he would be in the Star Stage.

Lin Yun was clearly only in the Heavenly Soul Realm, so there was a huge gap between someone in the Heavenly Soul Realm and the Empyrean Realm in terms of the quality of their energy. It was clearly bullying even though they tried to make it sound righteous.

“Come on then,” said Lin Yun calmly while looking at Yan Teng. There was a huge difference in their strength, and it would be tough for them to fight unless Lin Yun revealed his identity as Flower Burial. But if Yan Teng was only using half of his strength, then there was nothing Lin Yun had to be afraid of.

Lin Yun’s reply left everyone surprised because they didn’t think that Lin Yun would agree to it. Then again, they didn’t think that Lin Yun had another solution right now unless he was really going to kneel and beg for forgiveness.

“You’re courageous!” Yan Teng grinned with a sinister smile, “I told you, I’m only going to use half of my strength. If you can last ten moves, then I won’t make things difficult for you.”

The other disciples from the three clans also sneered when they heard that because Lin Yun was courting humiliation. It didn’t matter how much Yan Teng suppressed his strength, they believed that Lin Yun would be defeated.

“First move.” Yan Teng flashed and disappeared before everyone. When he reappeared, he was in front of Lin Yun, swinging his palm over at Lin Yun’s face. His palm was accompanied by thunder and wind that made everyone gasp.

But just when the slap was about to reach Lin Yun, the latter suddenly reached out and grabbed onto Yan Teng’s wrist. This scene had left everyone shocked before they wondered if this was a coincidence.

“You dare to stop me? Die!” Veins popped out on Yan Teng’s forehead as he flew into a rage and pushed his palm down like a ferocious beast.

Lin Yun didn’t face him head-on and merely flashed to avoid this move. Just like that, Yan Teng’s momentum carried him forward and his palm slapped the ground. When he turned back, his gaze locked onto Lin Yun and unleashed his second move.

But Lin Yun merely used the Golden Crow Nine Transformations and easily dodged this attack, leaving afterimages behind. Although Lin Yun’s afterimages were destroyed by Yan Teng, Yan Teng failed to even touch the corner of Lin Yun’s clothes.

Just like that, seven moves had passed in the blink of an eye with Yan Teng unable to do anything to Lin Yun. It was so unbelievable to the crowd that they could only gasp in shock.

Yan Teng’s face began to sink as he unleashed his aura to lock Lin Yun in place. However, Lin Yun didn’t seem to be restricted by it. After all, his sky sword intent was in complete mastery, and was only half a step from reaching the fourth grade. Not even an expert in the Astral Stage could do anything to him, not to mention someone in the Galaxy Stage.

Relying on the Golden Crow Nine Transformations, Lin Yun easily dodged Yan Teng’s attacks, and two more attacks passed in the blink of an eye. Not that he was only left with one move left, Yan Teng cursed inwardly before he unleashed all of his strength.

At this moment, he had unleashed all his cultivation and a violent gale exploded out from him and swept through the hall. Lin Yun was caught by surprise and was forced to take several steps back.

When he raised his head, a cold light flashed through his pupils because he was completely disappointed by the disciples of these three sects. He didn’t think that they would be so shameless.

“You’re messing with me? I’m giving you guidance and all you do is dodge. Today, I’ll teach you a lesson!” Yan Teng was overwhelmed by fury and felt that he was fooled by Lin Yun. But just when he charged forth, a black blur had already dashed out with its claws directed at Yan Teng.

“Watch out!” Lin Yun was shocked. It was Lil’ Red who stepped out, fearing that Lin Yun might be injured. Lil’ Red had yet to reach the Empyrean Realm, and there was no way it could be a match for Yan Teng in its cat form.

This had also surprised Yan Teng and the origin energy around him was torn apart before he could even react, leaving wounds on his cheeks. Touching the blood on his cheeks, killing intent began to explode out from Yan Teng the next moment as he dashed toward that cat in the next moment, “You damned cat, you’re courting death!”

He was too quick for Lil’ Red and he didn’t hold back any of his strength. So his palm landed on lIl’ Red with a loud explosion. Lil’ Red released a miserable howl before it fell onto the ground. Its boneshad shattered under the palm and it could only lie on the ground. No matter how it struggled, Lil’ Red could only groan out in pain and couldn’t get back up.

Looking at this scene, Lin Yun’s heart sank.

“Brother Yan, are you alright?” Xuan Fei and Lei Lan’s faces changed as they quickly came over.

“Slaughter that cat and turn it into ashes!” Yan Teng felt the stinging pain on his cheek and gnashed his teeth. The two didn’t hesitate to make their moves and charged toward Lil’ Red.

But just when they were about to reach Lil’ Red, Lin Yun soared into the sky and used the sword box to face Xuan Fei and Lei Lan’s attacks.

When Lin Yun took the attack, he let out a groan and his face turned pale. But he forced himself not to throw up blood by gnashing his teeth, using his body to block the attack meant for Lil’ Red.

“How annoying!” Yan Teng’s face became sinister as he threw a palm out towards the sword box.

The crowd was dumbfounded that the three of them would make a move against Lin Yun at the same time. Although the sword box had negated most of the damage, Lin Yun was still bleeding from the corner of his lips with one knee falling onto the ground.

Looking at this scene, tears fell from Lil’ Red’s eyes as it groaned. However, Lin Yun merely replied with a smile. In the next second, an outburst of white light exploded from the sword box that sent Yang Teng, Xuan Fei, and Lei Lan flying.

Taking advantage of this moment, Lin Yun took Lil’ Red into his embrace and quickly left.

“Stop!” Patriarch Qiu’s face sank seeing that Yan Teng’s party was about to pursue Lin Yun, “Are you guys going to kill a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect in front of me?”

Yan Teng’s group of three were briefly stunned before they recovered their composure. They had no intention of killing Lin Yun and only wanted to teach him a lesson, but they didn’t expect that they would be fooled instead. Yan Teng was especially upset because he suffered a wound on his face.

It was a great source of humiliation, but there was nothing they could do since Patriarch Qiu had spoken. In the end, Yan Teng smiled, “We were only messing around. It’s not that serious.”

Everyone else also smiled and returned to their seats. No longer concealing his fury, Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips and said, “I’ve witnessed the grace of the three sects. Since you guys want to play, then we’ll play!”

Before anyone could reply, he left with Lil’ Red. This instantly made the smile on Yan Teng’s group of three disappear. Lin Yun was still so arrogant even after he managed to survive? They realized that they had to cripple Lin Yun no matter what.

A hundred miles away from the Qiu Clan’s residence, Lil’ Red was in Lil’ Purple’s embrace as she spoke with heartache in her eyes, “Those bastards actually dared to injure Lil’ Red so badly? Lin Yun, you have to teach them a lesson no matter what!”

“You think dogs will behave if you teach them a lesson?” Lin Yun replied without changing the expression on his face.

“Then continue to teach them a lesson until they know how to behave!” Lil’ Purple said.

“Dogs like them should be killed,” said Lin Yun with a wisp of killing aura flashing through his pupils. When Lil’ Purple raised her head, she could see the terrifying chill on Lin Yun’s face.

Lin Yun’s heart was already overwhelmed with a killing aura after seeing Yan Teng picking on him time and time again. Now that they dared to make a move on Lil’ Red, Lin Yun could no longer bear the killing intent in his heart.

But fortunately, he still had his rationale and knew that it would only bring troubles to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect if he killed them. It just wasn’t the right time to kill them. From their arrogance, Lin Yun could tell that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s days hadn’t been good.

Furthermore, there was a chance they would escape if he made his move. After all, they were in the pinnacle Galaxy Stage, and even he wasn’t confident of dealing with all of them even after revealing his identity as Flower Burial. If he had to make a move, he had to ensure that he could kill them!
