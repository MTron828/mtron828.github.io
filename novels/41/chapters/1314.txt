Chapter 1315 - I Have A Good Temper

When the world suddenly became quiet, everyone could hear their own heartbeat clearly. Everyone from the Profound Sky Sect had their foreheads covered in sweat, and the disdain they previously had on their faces when looking at Lin Yun turned into shock and uneasiness.

Everything was too bizarre. Lin Yun was clearly only at the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm. He wasn’t from a big sect and there wasn’t anything special about him. But when their gazes fell onto him, they began to feel afraid for some reason with the core of their souls trembling. This was an instinct like they were being eyed by a predator.

“What aren’t you guys laughing anymore?” Lin Yun broke the silence as he looked at the group from the Profound Sky Sect with his killing aura gathering.

Zhang Ling’s expression also became grave as his constellation unfolded. Filling his entire body with astral energy, Zhang Ling coldly looked at Lin Yun. “Stop acting like you’re some big shot when you’re not. I advise you to get lost. No matter where you come from, there are no benefits in making yourself an enemy out of the Profound Sky Sect! You’ll only die a terrible death when standing against Senior Brother Qin Cang!”

When Zhang Ling spoke out, all the other Profound Sky Sect’s disciples felt relieved. Lin Yun was simply too terrifying. He intimidated them to the point that they even forgot that they were disciples of the Profound Sky Sect. The Profound Sky Sect was the undisputed overlord of the Ancient Barren Domain, even the Sword Sect had to give them some face.

The top three on the Empyrean Ranking all came from their Profound Sky Sect, especially Qin Cang, who was the strongest transcendent genius. Since he came from the Nether Divinity Clan, this only added more to his foundation. Thinking about it there, their gazes returned to indifference as they looked at Lin Yun.

“Qin Cang? That person doesn’t scare me. Since you guys aren’t going to give me some face, then there’s no need for me to give you guys any face…” Lin Yun calmly said. His words instantly left Qin Tian and Zhang Ting dumbfounded. They started to wonder if Lin Yun had a mental illness. They couldn’t figure out where Lin Yun got the confidence to say that to the Profound Sky Sect when he’s only a disciple from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

Lin Yun reached out and grabbed onto a sword that was lying on the ground. These people weren’t worthy of him using the Flower Burial Sword. This sword should’ve been forged by the Sword Sect. This also wasn’t an ordinary sword. It was comparable to saint artifacts. But with his ‘broken sword’ physique, this sword could only last three attacks from him.

“L-Lin Yun, don’t be impulsive. This person is Zhao Ling, ranked in the eight hundredths on the Empyrean Ranking. Now that he has reached the Elysium Core Realm, he has only gotten even stronger.” Qin Tian said upon seeing Lin Yun grabbing onto his sword.

“Kill him!” Zhao Ling ordered when he saw Lin Yun grabbing onto a sword. In the next second, several disciples of the Profound Sky Sect summoned their constellations and charged at Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun merely swung his sword and his sky sword intent, combined with his azure dragon aura, instantly dyed the entire sky in gold. His sword aura was as majestic as a bright sun as it pressed down with boundless astral energy.

At the same time, a draconic roar echoed, instantly destroying the constellations summoned by the disciples of the Profound Sky Sect. Shortly after, a silver light flashed and the clouds in the sky were split apart.

In the next second, the sword in Lin Yun’s hand broke apart. As for the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples, their bodies also shattered apart. It appeared that the sword couldn’t even endure him using a single attack.

While looking at the empty sword hilt, he seemed to have over estimated the durability. After reaching the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm, both his azure dragon sword aura and firmament sword intent greatly improved. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Die!” Zhang Ling, who had been accumulating his attack, suddenly made his move when the sword in Lin Yun’s hand broke apart. He was like a bright sun shining brightly with a purple crystal in his hand before pushing it at Lin Yun. He was strong, and he had a high ranking amongst the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples.

After he reached the Elysium Core Realm, he had a whole new comprehension of the Profound Sky Canon and threw Qin Tian far behind. The current him was no longer the same person he was before, and he was confident that he could forge his own fame in the Ancient Barren Domain. He also wanted to leave behind his name on the Elysium Core Ranking.

“You’re strong, but you can only be my stepping stone!” Zhang Ling said. He was feeling both nervous and excited because this was his first strong enemy after reaching the Elysium Core Realm. If he could defeat Lin Yun, then he would be able to rise in the Elysium Core Realm.

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, strongest of the Ancient Barren! Now, be suppressed by me!” Zhang Ling laughed.

But Lin Yun merely raised his palm. An azure dragon’s claw quickly manifested in the air. Then, the claw slammed down and Zhang Ling was crushed to death like a fly. The phenomenon created by Zhang Ling’s constellation also disappeared at the same time.

As the wind blew past, the three thousand dragon runes flashed on Lin Yun’s body with thunder rumbling in the sky, and each rumble of thunder was like a dragon roaring in the clouds. Lin Yun wanted to test the power of his Azure Dragon Grasp. This was why he didn’t hold back with this attack. But he didn’t think that he would be able to kill Zhang Ling in a single attack. This had even startled him.

This was a little terrifying because he didn’t even summon his constellation. So he couldn’t imagine how strong he would become if he summoned his constellation. At this moment, Lin Yun knew that the true Azure Dragon Saint Art was back even without the Azure Dragon True Bone.

Down below, Qin Tian and Zhang Ting were dumbfounded. They couldn’t process what they had just seen. Was this still the Lin Yun that they knew? The core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, Lin Yun?

The two’s minds blew with their legs and lips trembling. A long time later, the word ‘invincible’ appeared in their minds when they saw this scene. After all, that was the best word they could find to describe him.

Zhang Ting’s legs began to violently tremble, especially when he recalled how he tried to humiliate Lin Yun back then. Just thinking about that alone made his face turn pale.

Lin Yun gently jumped off the rock and landed before the two of them. Seeing Lin Yun, Zhang Ting was so scared that he fell onto his knees and sobbed, “D-D-Don’t kill me. I’m sorry for provoking you earlier. It wasn’t on purpose.”

On the other hand, Qin Tian’s face was ugly. Although his performance wasn’t as terrible as Zhang Ting's, he was also feeling nervous with his forehead covered in sweat. He was feeling uneasy at this moment, with his heart nearly jumping out of his chest.

He recalled how he held Lin Yun in disdain and even called Lin Yun a fly. Looking at Lin Yun now, he knew that Lin Yun could easily suppress him. But, Lin Yun didn’t do that, probably to give Ye Ziling some face.

“I can’t accept your kneel. So get up!” Lin Yun reached out to grab Zhang Ting’s shoulder and dragged him off the ground.

“You…” Zhang Ting was shocked with disbelief.

“Don’t worry. Didn’t I tell you earlier that I’m known for having a good temper?” Lin Yun smiled with a wink.

Zhang Ting gulped down a mouthful of saliva before he turned to look at the corpse on the ground, the corpse of Zhang Ling that had been turned into mashed meat. His legs began to tremble once more. He couldn’t tell how Lin Yun could have a ‘good temper’, and this also made him so nervous that he didn’t dare to utter a single word.

“Lin Yun, something happened to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. I received Senior Sister Mu Qingqing’s instructions to go and assist them,” said Qin Tian after mustering his courage.

When Lin Yun heard that, he immediately thought about the eight big sects. When he was outside the Profound Wither Island, he had already formed a grudge with the eight big sects, not to mention that Senior Brother Feng Jue killed the Dragon Pulse Realms of the eight big sects. They might not dare to touch him outside the Profound Wither Island, but they would definitely make a move on the Profound Wither Island.

“They’re trying to force you to show up because you snatched the opportunity of Bai Luli from the Flame Dragon Sect. So they’re joining hands to deal with you,” explained Qin Tian.

When Lin Yun heard that, killing intent began to flash in his pupils. Before he had reached the Astral Stage, he had heavily injured the other party but failed to kill Bai Luli. But he never thought that Bai Luli would sweep over again.

“This actually has nothing to do with you.” Qin Tian quickly said upon seeing the killing intent flashing in Lin Yun’s pupils. “Senior Sister Mu Qingqing said that there are rumors circulating between the powerful sects that Flower Burial has shown up on the Profound Wither Island. So this means that they have the support of powerful sects. They might be trying to force you to show yourself on the surface, but they’re actually trying to force Flower Burial out.”

Nothing to do with me? I’m Flower Burial! Lin Yun merely glanced at Qin Tian, but he didn’t tell him that he was Flower Burial, and turned around.

“Don’t be impulsive. I admit that you’re strong, but there’s nothing you can do to help, even if you go there. The eight big sects are only secondary when compared to the powerful sects in the Ancient barren Domain, and they have many Greater Elysium Core Realm experts on this island. Let’s wait for Senior Sister Mu Qingqing and the rest to head over or Flower Burial to show up. This is no longer something that we can get involved in.” Qin Tian stopped Lin Yun, trying to persuade him against going. After all, Lin Yun had saved his life, and he couldn’t just watch him court death.

“Have you ever wondered why the Profound Sky Sect tried to act against you over a quasi-saint elixir?” Lin Yun asked calmly.

Qin Tian wasn’t a fool, and he could instantly tell what Lin Yun was trying to say. He instantly realized that the Profound Sky Sect was secretly involved in this matter. Since he was stopped by the Profound Sky Sect, then there was a high chance that Mu Qingqing and the rest were also stopped by the transcendent geniuses of the Profound Sky Sect. This way, no one would be able to save the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect unless Flower Burial shows up.

As for Lin Yun, the Profound Sky Sect didn’t even place him in their eyes from the beginning; he was a mere excuse that the Profound Sky Sect found.

“Get it now?” Lin Yun pushed Qin Tian away and smiled, “Furthermore, I’m not being impulsive. Don’t forget that I’m known for having a good temper.”

When Qin Tian and Zhang Ting heard what Lin Yun said, they both felt a chill down their spines. Looking at Lin Yun’s silhouette, they felt as if they had seen a river of blood and a path of corpses. Gritting their teeth, they ultimately followed him.
