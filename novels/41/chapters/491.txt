Chapter 492 - Great Boost in Strength

Liu Yunyan’s words shocked Lin Yun. He only told Bai Yi that he came from the Great Qin Empire, but Liu Yunyan managed to guess his identity with that? Wasn’t she a little too terrifying?

After all, the Great Qin Empire was nothing to an existence like the Heavenly Province Academy. Many people hadn’t even heard of the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s name. Even Bai Yi only knew about the Great Qin Empire. She knew nothing of the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

“Miss Liu’s insight has impressed me,” replied Lin Yun after a brief pause. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Flower Burial, it’s really you.” Liu Yunyan turned around and she looked at Lin Yun. “You don’t have to feel weird about it. The Draconic Banquet will be held a year from now and each prefecture will have our own Dragon Gate Competitions. It’s not difficult for the academy to gather the information on the various competitions. But only you, Flower Burial, left me with a deep impression. So you don’t have to feel weird that I guessed your identity.”

Lin Yun raised his brow and smiled, “Is that so? Then I should feel honored.”

“Rumor has it that you’ve already grasped the complete xiantian sword intent. If that’s the case, then I’m somewhat confident in you holding back Leng Yi.” Liu Yunyan paused briefly before she continued, “But you’ll die a miserable death if you think that you can hold back Leng Yi with the xiantian sword intent alone.”

“You don’t have to worry about that,” said Lin yun.

“Furthermore, Bai Yi is innocent. I won’t let you off if you did anything to her,” said Liu Yunyan as she finally got into the right topic.

“What’s the matter? Is Miss Liu jealous? I’m not interested in you or that lass. I already have someone in my heart,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Are you trying to provoke me?” Liu Yunyan’s face turned cold. “I suggest you don’t.”

Suddenly, spiritual runes began to appear around her that intertwined together to release a terrifying pressure.

“Third grade spiritual runes!” Lin Yun was surprised. Bai Yi said that Liu Yunyan was a second grade spiritualist. This meant that Liu Yunyan must’ve made a breakthrough.

“Impressive eyesight. Bai Yi has a complicated background, so I suggest you don’t touch her,” said Liu Yunyan as she left.

“Unreasonable,” muttered Lin Yun.

Lin Yun spent the next few days cultivating and traveling with the Heavenly Province Academy’s party. He had to be honest that he felt the pressure coming from Liu Yunyan, so he spent most of his time converting his origin energy.

The last step wasn’t easy, but Lin Yun had nearly a thousand third grade spiritual jades. With so many resources, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to convert his origin energy into sword energy.

After the Draconian Rockrats crisis, the journey was smooth and without tribulation. The whole journey was rather smooth and no one said anything about Lin Yun disappearing and appearing.

As they gradually went deeper into the Bloodbone Mountain Range, the demonic beasts they encountered got stronger. They could also sense the other forces gathering. So they could imagine the competition that they would face for the Indigoflame Goldlotus.

Four days later, a boundless spiritual energy fluctuated from Lin Yun that covered him in a silvery glow. On the ground, a silvery Iris Flower bloomed as it absorbed spiritual energy from the surroundings. As for Lin Yun, who was seated in the flower, he looked like a sheathed sword.

Occasionally, sword intent would buzz in the surrounding as it kept accumulating. A brief moment later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and a sharp flicker flashed in his black pupils.

Lin Yun let out a long breath, and his origin energy buzzed around him like countless swords. His aura was like a torrential wave.

“I’ve finally converted all my origin energy into sword energy.” Lin Yun clenched his right fist and he could sense the powerful origin energy flowing in his body. Right now, he was confident in crushing any ordinary lesser Yin stage wandering cultivator. Even if he encountered someone like Liu Yunyan, he was confident that he would obtain the upperhand.

No one would believe him if he told anyone about this. No one would believe that someone in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm from a small place would be so terrifying. But Lin Yun’s target wasn’t just matching his opponent evenly.

“Time to refine the Heavenly Soul Realm’s beast core.” Lin Yun flipped his hand and the beast core appeared. The Dracophant Battle Physique had already reached the pinnacle fifth stage, so he only had to refine this beast core to bring it to a whole new level. There was no question that he would be more powerful after refining this beast core.

With a thought, the dracophant energy spread throughout his body, refining the beast core. Suddenly, the violent energy exploded and enveloped Lin Yun. Along with the violent energy flowing into his body, he could sense his body undergoing a change.

A terrifying aura began to spread out from Lin Yun’s body that instantly caused an uproar in the forest. Many demonic beasts were trembling in fear, but there were also many Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts who resided deep in the forest that quietly approached with eager eyes.

In their view, an overlord was going to be born and was challenging their position. The contest between demonic beasts was brutal, so they wouldn’t allow an overlord to be born so easily.

Suddenly, flames began to blaze on the surface of Lin Yun’s body along with intense pain. The flame belonged to the Dracophant Flame. The violent energy within the beast core turned into flames to refine his body, which meant that Lin Yun was undergoing a rebirth.

His bones constantly cracked and repaired themselves, but Lin Yun gritted his teeth silently the whole time. This wasn’t his first time refining his physique, so he knew that he had to undergo this tribulation in order to reach the end. If he couldn’t bear it, then he would be turned into minced meat.

But fortunately, he had already undergone this pain before, so he wasn’t panicking. As the Dracophant Flame blazed on his body, Lin Yun’s aura gradually became more violent like an ancient beast. The ground was trembling and the surrounding trees snapped from the terrifying pressure. The flame on his body felt as though it could incinerate anything in the world.

Half an hour later, everything within a thousand meter range was burned into ashes. It feels as if this entire place had gone back to ancient times where ancient beasts reigned the earth.

Suddenly, the flames began to shrink into an ancient symbol on his chest like a tattoo that was imprinted on his body. His skin was white and his entire body felt powerful.

Lin Yun opened his eyes, and he let out a breath. He knew that he had succeeded as he sensed the power flowing throughout his body. At the same time, he was shocked to discover that his strength had increased by at least 50%.

While changing into a new pair of clothes, a lesser Yin stage demonic beasts charged at him. This was an elite beast. This place was its territory and Lin Yun’s appearance had challenged its prestige.

“Great timing,” smiled Lin Yun as he threw a punch. This was a punch that purely contained the dracophant energy alone. When he threw his punch out, the roar of a dracophant rang out that made Lin Yun seem like an ancient beast. This instantly weakened the demonic aura around the demonic beast.

When his punch landed on the demonic beast, it caused a huge collision and the demonic beast was sent flying. After the demonic beast was sent flying, it fell onto the ground with a painful groan as it rolled on the ground. But this was still an elite demonic beast, so it had a stronger defence than humans. Although, it was heavily injured.

“Twenty cauldron’s worth of strength.” Lin Yun rejoiced when he felt his strength. He never expected that the Dracophant Battle Physique would be so powerful upon reaching complete mastery.

Looking at the symbol on his chest, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with excitement. He knew that his punch would be even more powerful if he activated the Dracophant Flame. He instantly decided to give it a try.

But just when he was about to launch his attack, he realized that the demonic beast was looking at him with fear before fleeing in a hurry. Even many of the demonic beasts in the surroundings also began to retreat.

“They’re rather tactful. Let’s just hope that everyone else going after the Indigoflame Goldlotus will be just as tactful…” Lin Yun narrowed his eyes as he was filled with even more anticipation for the Indigoflame Goldlotus competition.
