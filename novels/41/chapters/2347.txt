Chapter 2348 - Swordsmen Aren't Afraid!

No matter how much Gu Jun’s face changed, it was, indeed, a resounding slap. Although most of it was withstood by his sword aura, it was humiliating, especially when Lin Yun took his sword away at the end.

Everyone in the surroundings was shocked and baffled, “How did he do it? To defeat the Divine Astral Sword with just a tree branch.”

“If I remember correctly, no one should be able to injure Gu Jun with his body-refining technique.”

This was a shocking scene that no one could comprehend what was going on.

“Ha, Lin Yun is a prodigy swordsman from the Kunlun Realm, grasping the Divine Light Sword Intent at complete mastery. In terms of his talent in the sword, even Gu Jun is inferior.”

“That’s right. Gu Jun relied on three Sovereign Daos to block Lin Yun’s sword intent. By then, he had already lost.”

“A tree branch and a sword are no different in his hand with such a powerful sword intent...”

“It looks like Flower Burial is really going to reforge Kunlun Realm’s honor, walking the same path as the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity.” Some cultivators heard of the Kunlun Realm and Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity. As they spoke, they couldn’t help comparing Lin Yun with the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity.

Back then, the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity was invincible and forged his name. When he established the Heavenly Path, he caused a massive uproar in the universe.

“Flower Burial...” Gu Jun gritted his teeth as he recalled his sword. He might look pathetic, but the tree branch wasn’t the Flower Burial Sword, and Lin Yun couldn’t inflict heavy injuries on Gu Jun. Not to mention that Gu Jun’s Golden Jade Divine Physique negated most of the damage.

“I’m inferior to you in terms of talent, but you won’t be my opponent if I go all out!” Gu Jun ferociously looked at Lin Yun.

Constellation? Lin Yun smiled. Was Gu Jun even worthy of comparing constellations with him? He could already summon his full Sovereign Constellation, which solely belonged to him. As for divine physique, Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of anyone, even if he fought a genius who became a Saint by tempering their physique.

Lin Yun was calm while everyone else’s face became grave.

“Are they still going to fight to the end? There’s still a test ongoing...”

“But what Gu Jun said isn’t fake. His Golden Jade Divine Physique is famous, and his constellation is invincible beneath Sovereign Constellations.”

“Lin Yun hasn’t even brought out his constellation, so where did Gu Jun get his confidence from?” Discussions resounded from the surroundings because Lin Yun had subdued many people with his performance, with more people supporting him.

Lin Yun looked around, and said, “It looks like the slap was too light, and you still haven’t realized the reality yet.”

Murderous intent began to flash in Lin Yun’s eyes, but he didn’t know if he could kill in the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain. Since there were three stages, there were bound to be observers maintaining the order. His tone might sound calm, but it excited everyone and rubbed salt on Gu Jun’s wound.

“Get lost, or don’t regret it after I draw my sword!” Lin Yun said indifferently.

Gu Jun was shocked because he didn’t expect Lin Yun to be so impolite. Lin Yun’s words also scared everyone else because no one dared to be so disrespectful to a Divine Clan before.

Gu Jun coldly said, “You want to carry on participating in the test? Hand over the Golden Dao Fruit or don’t even think about going through the test. You should have at least three Golden Dao Fruits still on you!”

He was certain that Lin Yun’s boost in strength was due to the Golden Dao Fruit, which was why he wanted it. Lin Yun could only refine five Golden Dao Fruits at most, so he must still have some on him.

But he never expected that Lin Yun would share the Golden Dao Fruits with Lin Jiangxian and Xiong Tiannan. In his view, a treasure like that could be used to exchange for precious treasures on the same level, and it made no sense to give them away.

“I have never seen someone so shameless like you before. You first want to dig out my saint origin, and now you want my Golden Dao Fruit? I advise you not to challenge my patience,” Lin Yun smiled.

“So what if I did?” Gu Jun said coldly. “What can you do to me? If I said that no one is allowed to pass, it means no one is allowed to pass!”

All the geniuses from the Gu Clan gathered around Gu Jun. There were four seventh-stage Saint Lords, and the rest were sixth-stage Saint Lords.

“Activate the bloodline and let them see the strength of the Gu Divine Clan!” Gu Jun roared as a golden seal bloomed on everyone’s foreheads, their bloodline activated. When their aura combined, it contained a hint of divinity, scaring everyone in the surroundings.

“Since you don’t want to hand over a Golden Dao Fruit, you must hand all three over now!” Gu Jun said coldly. “You’re alone, so how will you face the entire Gu Clan yourself?”

“Who said that Big Brother Lin is alone?” Ji Zixi stood beside Lin Yun, activating her phoenix bloodline with a pair of phoenix wings appearing behind her.

“The Heavenly Phoenix Maiden!” Someone exclaimed from the crowd, with everyone shocked. Even the Gu Clan was shocked because no one’s bloodline was more noble than the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, and she was standing beside Lin Yun.

“Don’t forget about me. I have never treated the deity’s bloodline seriously, and I’ll dig your clan’s tomb in the future!” Xiong Tiannan laughed.

Lin Jiangxian also released her sword intent. Both sides began to face off.

The deity’s bloodline was truly terrifying, especially with twenty of them combined together. Standing in the crowd, Gu Jun activated his deity’s bloodline with the mark appearing on his forehead. Looking at it carefully, it looked like an ancient array that linked everyone’s deity bloodline together. He snorted, “So what if you’re the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden? I’ll deal with you today as well!”

“Flower Burial, let me join in as well,” Ao Jue smiled as he approached Lin Yun’s side.

This made Lin Yun, Lin Jiangxian, Xiong Tiannan, and Ji Zixi surprised because Ao Jue was Lin Jiangxian’s rival in the Azure Cloud Realm.

Ao Jue grinned with a blade on his back, “What’s the matter? Looking down on me? I’m at least one of the chief disciples of the Azure Cloud Realm. Lin Yun, do you welcome me?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s my honor,” Lin Yun smiled. “We all share the same goal after all.”

“Hahaha! Well said!” Ao Jue laughed as he looked at the surrounding cultivators, “Aren’t there any swordsmen? Even a bladesman like me dares to stand out. Are all the swordsmen dead? Or are you guys terrified of the Divine Clan?”

Ao Jue’s voice was infectious and left many people stumped, including Lin Yun, who had no idea what Ao Jue was trying to do.

Gu Jun noticed that the situation was getting out of hand, so he threatened, “This is the Gu Clan’s matter. If anyone dares to interfere, I have many means to deal with you mortal bloods, even if killing is prohibited on Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain.”

“Fuck!”

“So what if we interfere?”

“The Divine Clan can do whatever they want? You think that swordsmen don’t have a temper?”

“Why would we swordsmen fear a fight!”

“Even a bladesman stood out, so what do we swordsmen have to fear?!”

All the present swordsmen became enraged.

Ao Jue’s voice contained provocation, which made all the swordsmen feel aggrieved. But after hearing what Gu Jun said, their blood began to boil as over a hundred people stood behind Lin Yun. They roared, “Why do we swordsmen fear a fight! Flower Burial, we will help you up the mountain today! You can beat up a deity’s bloodline with a tree branch, so why would we fear with our swords in our hands?! The worst scenario is death, and no swordsman is afraid of dying!”

Lin Yun was surprised to see so many people on their side.

“A bunch of ants dares to oppose a Divine Clan? Slaughter all the mortal bloods!” Gu Jun said coldly, “Starting with that demonic brat.”

Since Ao Jue dared to interfere, he would start with him first. The moment he said that, two figures charged at Ao Jue. They were geniuses of the Divine Clan with a cultivation at the sixth-stage Saint Lord. When they joined hands with their bloodline activated, they could even confront a seventh-stage Saint Lord, and it was more than enough to deal with Ao Jue.

At the same time, the other geniuses of the Gu Clan charged at Ji Zixi and the others.

“Great!” Ao Jue laughed as he drew his blade. As a demonic radiance shone from him, his blade gave off a domineering aura that forced those who got close to him to take a few steps back.
