Chapter 2142: Why Don't You Take A Guess?

“Ye Qingtian, you might be strong, but I have never taken you seriously. Now isn’t the time for us to fight, but we’ll fight again for the final champion title!” Mu Qianjue calmly retreated as he gradually left the Indigo Dragon Path.

Lin Yun sheathed his sword and slightly opened his mouth because he had no idea what Mu Qianjue meant by running away. Not only him, but everyone outside the Dragon Mountains were also shocked. They were expecting an earth-shattering battle, but they didn’t expect that Mu Qianjue would back down and was forced to leave the Indigo Dragon Path by Ye Qingtian.

Everyone could guess that this was because Mu Qianjue didn’t want to reveal too much of his strength to maintain his competitiveness for the final champion title, but Mu Qianjue retreating in such a decisive manner made him look a little cowardly.

“He left just like that?”

“Ye Qingtian is strong enough to make Mu Qianjue retreat without a fight. I feel that the myth of the Heavenly Paths’ champions is shattered now.”

“What are you thinking about? Mu Qianjue did this because he wanted to preserve his strength.”

“Haha, doesn’t Ye Qingtian need to preserve his strength as well?” What happened with Mu Qianjue sparked a huge debate since Lin Yun and Mu Qianjue had a great number of supporters.

Lin Yun felt somewhat dissatisfied as he stood on the Dragon’s Head. There was no doubt that Mu Qianjue was a formidable opponent, but it was a pity that they couldn’t clash. Then again, it was unavoidable for Mu Qianjue to be too much of an utilitarian.

When he turned around, he saw that Bai Lixuan was still fighting the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son. After Bai Lixuan’s saint sword shattered, he chose to face the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son head-on with the Imperial Dragon Fist, and the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son couldn’t gain any advantage in the fight.

Lin Yun naturally noticed Bai Lixuan a long time ago, and he was rather puzzled about what he was doing here.

“Let’s end this game now.” Noticing that Lin Yun had finished his fight, Bai Lixuan no longer hid his strength and took out another saint sword. This time, it was a Glory Saint Artifact enveloped in a golden dragon aura. He unsheathed the sword and swung it without hesitation after bringing it out.

The Heavenly Star Pavilion’s holy son was already barely holding on. So when he took Bai Lixuan’s attack head-on, his saint dao shattered and was sent flying away, throwing out a mouthful of blood while landing outside the Dragon Mountain.

Lin Yun immediately recognized that Bai Lixuan was using a Dragon Clan’s sword technique. Not only that, but Bai Lixuan even refined a lot of dragon’s blood or even a Divine Dragon Bone.

After Bai Lixuan sheathed his sword, he turned coldly around and saw Lin Yun walking over. He naturally couldn’t recognize the latter since Lin Yun was in a disguise as Ye Qingtian.

“Impressive swordsmanship,” Lin Yun smiled. No matter what, Bai Lixuan helped to stop the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son earlier, and Lin Yun naturally had to express his goodwill to Bai Lixuan.

Just when Bai Lixuan wanted to reply, the Ancient Moon Sect’s holy son that came with the Heavenly Star Pavilion’s holy son soared to the sky, executing his strongest move when Bai Lixuan turned around.

A bright moon rose to the sky and illuminated the surroundings. When the Ancient Moon Sect’s holy son rose to the sky, he disappeared in the next moment, showing his inhuman speed. He had been brewing this attack for a long time, aiming at Bai Lixuan.

Lin Yun’s face changed because if this attack lands on Bai Lixuan, the latter would be heavily injured. But he was some distance away from Bai Lixuan, and it was already too late for him to make a move now.

Bai Lixuan was briefly stunned before his expression returned to being calm. This was because a figure appeared behind Bai Lixuan, and this person was a bald monk who threw out a punch.

As a tiger and a dragon roared, two beasts appeared behind this monk, and the roars from the two beasts made the entire Indigo Dragon Path violently tremble.

“The Dragon-Tiger Fist? No… it just looks similar, and the profundity contained in this punch is completely different.” Lin Yun was shocked.

The Ancient Moon Sect’s holy son was forced to show himself under the might of this fist and took the punch head-on. A huge hole appeared in his chest, and he was beaten to half-dead on the spot.

“How sinful, how sinful.” The handsome monk chanted as he clasped his hands together with a smile. This monk looked handsome and holy, but his actions were brutal, instantly intimidating everyone on the Indigo Dragon Path.

“Get lost!” This person was Drifting Goblet, who waved his hand and threw the Ancient Moon Sect’s holy son out as though he was throwing away trash.

“Young Master Ye, it has been a long time since we last met. Do you have any good wine?” Drifting Goblet looked at Lin Yun with a smile.

Lin Yun stepped forth with his expression changed, and he asked with his voice lowered, “Since the two of you are here, does that mean that Ziyao is also here?”

“Why don’t you take a guess?” Drifting Goblet smiled, he clearly had no good intentions.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched as he began to look around. But no matter how he tried to find her, he couldn’t see Su Ziyao anywhere in the crowd. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

On the contrary, everyone beneath the Dragon Mountains were baffled when they saw Lin Yun nervously looking around. They began to wonder what was going on with Ye Qingtian. After all, Ye Qingtian didn’t even fear the champion of a Heavenly Path, so why did he look a little afraid? Who or what was he afraid of?

“Ye Qingtian, well done!” Drifting Goblet said with a playful smile.

“I’m not afraid.” Lin Yun might seem calm on the surface, but he was feeling a little uneasy in his heart.

“Let’s not talk about it now. Look at where Mu Qianjue is going now,” Drifting Goblet said as he pointed to Mu Qianjue’s direction.

Lin Yun turned around and saw Mu Qianjue looking around, noticing that there were strong opponents on the other Dragon’s Head. In the end, he gritted his teeth and headed to the True Dragon Path.

“Get lost!” Mu Qianjue had a strong stance, and pushed his palm forth at Cao Yang, who was seated on the throne before he even arrived on the True Dragon Path.

“That bastard!” Lin Yun’s face changed and asked Drifting Goblet to take care of An Liuyan before he soared to the sky, heading towards the True Dragon Path.
