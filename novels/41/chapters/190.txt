Chapter 191 - Not Enough

Perhaps Lin Yun had been acknowledged by the Sword Burial Woods after grasping the complete sword intent. The sword intent in the array still existed, but now it looked like ordinary bamboo woods. However, they couldn’t afford to be careless when approaching the bamboo building.

“Let’s be careful,” reminded Lin Yun.

“Hehe, I was waiting for you to say that.” Li Wuyou jumped between the bamboos like a monkey before he landed on the bamboo building. Lin Yun, on the other hand, slowly walked towards the building with the Dragon Blooded Horse.

The courtyard was empty. Aside from two stone platforms, the bamboo building built on the water was the only structure present.

“This place is freezing.” Li Wuyou sighed while shivering from the cold. His eyes looked around. This place had no treasures, not even weeds were present.

“Big brother, I’ll take a look at this room.” Li Wuyou said, looking at Lin Yun, who was touching the stone platform.

“Are you sure about that? The owner might be around,” responded Lin Yun.

“That’s impossible. Who would stay in such a freezing place? At most, they would only come occasionally. I’ll be going in. Don’t blame me for not giving you anything I find.” Li Wuyou walked straight into the building. He hoped that the senior who lived here had left something behind.

Lin Yun turned to look at the stone platform again. The surface of the stone platform was painted with messy patterns. He couldn’t tell if those patterns were natural or man-made. After looking around in the courtyard, Lin Yun ended up at the edge of the lake. Due to the fog, he could only see the edge of it.

“It’s somewhat similar to the Sword Burial Woods’ fog. Although I can’t go deep into this lake, I can still check for Yin energy!” Lin Yun was confident that there was Yin energy here.

But the Yin energy here wasn’t the same as the Yin Wind Stream. The Yin energy here was perfectly sealed without any flaws. It was unlike the Yin Wind Stream that had been heavily damaged. That was the reason why the Yin Wind Stream became a forbidden ground that caused even Profound Martial Realms to lose their lives.

Thinking about it, Lin Yun returned to the stone platforms and examined them. A brief moment later, he finally noticed the slight differences between the two stone platforms.

“This one is being used often. The surface is much smoother…” It seems that someone used the Yin energy here to cultivate. All ice-attributed cultivation techniques could use the Yin energy to get twice the results with half the effort.

But the efficiency was far inferior to the Sky Devouring Art. With the Sky Devouring Art, he could directly devour as much Yin energy as he wanted.

“There’s nothing here. The old fart living here must be really broke…” Li Wuyou, who was full of joy previously, came out disappointed.

Lin Yun smiled, “These bamboo are a treasure land. Although the array has been temporarily suspended, the sword intent contained in the bamboos still exists. Practicing sword techniques here will be more effective.”

“That makes sense. But how do we get out?” Li Wuyou frowned, looking at the fog covering the cold lake.

“There’s no rush for us to leave.” Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry. He’d just grasped the complete sword intent and he still needed to stabilize it.

“Does anyone live here?” Li Quyou asked with a guilty conscience.

Lin Yun didn’t answer him and walked straight into the bamboo woods. Without uttering a single word, he started cultivating. After all, how could he put such a precious place to waste? Ever since he left the Azure Sword Sect, he had never suffered such a huge blow of being forced into a dead-end.

Not to mention that he was even humiliated in public, which made his heart turn cold. It didn’t matter if it was for the Dragon Blooded Horse, Li Wuyou, or himself, he couldn’t let this go!

Wang Ning, Huangfu Jingxuan, Feng Haoyu, Han Mo, and Han Feng wouldn’t let him go. Right now, he desperately needed to strengthen himself. He summoned the sword box, opened it up, and grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword to execute the Thunderclap Sword Art—Violet Gale. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

His wrist trembled, creating countless sword afterimages. Inserting his complete sword intent into the sword, Lin Yun stabbed out eighty-one times in one breath. When the afterimages of his sword overlapped, thunderclaps began to resound in the surrounding.

Lin Yun created a huge dust cloud from his sword, but that wasn’t enough. With a flickering light in his eyes, Lin Yun roared and stabbed out nine more times.

He had executed the Iris Sword Art to the limit and his sword intent surged like ferocious dragons. The sword in his hand was blurred and hard to follow, so only the thunderclaps could be heard. The ground rumbled and the bamboo swayed.

“Holy shit…” Li Wuyou was stunned. He never expected that the complete sword intent would be so powerful. Lin Yun’s sword technique was on a whole new level. The most frightening thing of all this was that the thunderclaps left Li Wuyou’s internal organs trembling.

Such prowess was no longer within the range of Xiantian Realm. Shaking his head, Li Wuyou smacked his lips together, “I didn’t believe it when people were saying how Bai Lixuan defeated disciples in the Profound Martial Realm…”

But after witnessing Lin Yun’s sword technique, he had no choice but to believe it. The complete sword intent was terrifying.

Next up, Lin Yun executed the Thunderclap Sword Art—Drifting Flowers. With sword intent rippling on his body, the wind suddenly came to a stop. Just when Li Wuyou thought that Lin Yun would rest, Lin Yun’s sword moved again. His sword was like a withering petal, seeking life in death.

“It’s faster this time.” Li Wuyou raised his brow. He could keenly sense Lin Yun’s sword getting faster. This time, Lin Yun was using the Thunderclap Sword Art—Descending Snow.

The temperature in the bamboo woods dropped sharply as Lin Yun’s sword intent spread out like a white cloud. The sword in his hand was as agile as snow and contained a touch of spirituality. When he brandished his sword, all the bamboos within a range of a few hundred of meters were blown back. But when Lin Yun pulled his sword back, the bamboos snapped backwards, unleashing sword intent in Lin Yun’s direction.

“Moon Chasing!” Lin Yun smiled and executed the fourth move in the Thunderclap Sword Art. It was a technique that brought speed to the pinnacle to chase after the moon. Lin Yun further enhanced this move with his sword intent, disappearing in a way that made the stars and moon look like they were being left in the dust by him. When he reappeared, he was already hundreds of meters away.

“Breaking through so easily…” Li Wuyou held onto his chin in disbelief. Lin Yun couldn’t resist the bamboos’ sword intent, but Lin Yun managed to break through them with unbelievable speed. Divine Firmament was the final move in the Thunderclap Sword Art.

After executing a full set of Thunderclap Sword Art, the Flower Burial Sword was trembling at an unprecedented level. Lin Yun waved his hand casually. But when he did this, a thunderclap exploded from his sword.

The thunderclap exploded with sword intent that spread out in all directions and snapped the bamboos. When Lin Yun withdrew his sword, all the bamboos within a thousand meter radius had collapsed.

The sword intent contained in the bamboo began to dissipate before the ancient runes quietly absorbed them. Otherwise, the bamboo woods would be destroyed if the sword intent wasn’t controlled.

“Rumbling like thunder and shattering the sky. My Thunderclap Sword Art has finally reached complete mastery.” Lin Yun let out a long breath. He had finally understood the last move. It required the complete sword intent.

Li Wuyou was shocked. After a long time, he smiled bitterly, “The complete sword intent is really terrifying. Until reaching the Profound Martial Realm, I’m afraid that I won’t be able to catch up to you.”

“This is still not enough,” Lin Yun calmly said while sheathing his sword.

Not enough? Li Wuyou scratched his head. Why wasn’t it enough? It was already so powerful. He didn’t know that Lin Yun had the desire to kill Wang Ning. There were also Huangfu Jingxuan, Feng Haoyu, Han Mo, and Han Feng. Lin Yun didn’t want to let any of them go.

“Someone is coming!” shouted Lin Yun.

“Where?!” Li Wuyou was shocked. When he looked up, he saw a fishing boat with an old man that was arriving at the shore.

“Let’s go. We finally know what’s going on in this place.” Lin Yun hurried over to the courtyard.

On the other hand, Li Wuyou felt awkward, but he still gnashed his teeth and followed Lin Yun. The old fisherman was slowly strolling over with a fish basket. He took off his hat and revealed his wrinkled face.

He had black and white hair, an unshaved beard, and an old headscarf tied to his forehead.

When he saw Lin Yun and Li Wuyou, there was no change to his face. But when he saw the mark on Lin Yun’s forehead, he smiled, “There’s actually a sword slave in my Sword Burial Woods.” He then went straight to the bamboo building.

Li Wuyou suddenly wailed in his heart.
