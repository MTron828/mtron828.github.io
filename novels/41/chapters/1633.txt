Chapter 1634 - Who Dare Claims To Be Invincible Before Flower Burial?

Everyone initially thought that the four holy land geniuses might be able to restrain Qin Tian, but they were disappointed. When they looked at Qin Tian again, their pupils were only filled with respect and fear. After all, who else could deal with Qin Tian when not even the holy lands’ disciples could do such a feat? The Profound Sky Sect was determined to monopolize the Blue Dragon Saint Palace.

“The Ancient Barren Domain is ultimately the territory of Tian Xuanzi!”

“Qin Tian even dares to beat the holy lands’ geniuses. He’s forging prestige for his master, telling them that Tian Xuanzi is the future ruler of the Ancient Barren Domain. After all, the Radiant Sword Saint is old…”

“How oppressive. It looks like the Ancient Barren Domain is going to change.” Everyone was chatting amongst themselves. Before Qin Tian could say another word, they began to retreat. After all, that earlier battle had destroyed their confidence, and they no longer dared to yearn for the Blue Dragon Saint Palace.

This made Gu Ruochen’s face change because he managed to see that the current situation wasn’t right. He whispered, “Junior Sister Mu, leave with everyone. Qingxuan and I will cover you guys.”

He couldn’t help it because the strength revealed by Qin Tian was too terrifying. Even if those holy lands’ disciples were only inner disciples, they still came from holy lands. Their power was equivalent to chief disciples like them, but Qin Tian could trounce them, and this was enough to prove that Qin Tian was a lot stronger than everyone else.

“No one from the Sword Sect is allowed to leave today!” A roar echoed as Qin Tian turned to look at the Sword Sect’s party with a cold smirk.

This briefly stunned everyone, and they nearly forgot that the Profound Sky Sect’s Yan Kong died in Lin Yun’s hands. They still thought that Qin Tian wouldn’t remember it. So was it destined that the Sword Sect wouldn’t be able to escape this ordeal?

As everyone’s gazes fell onto Lin Yun and the others, their eyes flashed with sympathy. After all, the Sword Sect lost their Golden Generation geniuses two decades ago, and even a heaven-defying genius like Jian Jingtian was lost to them. Today, what happened two decades ago would probably re-enact itself, and it would only be worse than what happened two decades ago.

“Lin Yun, why aren’t you coming out?!” Liu Xu roared, looking at everyone from the Sword Sect.

“Come out! You dare to kill Senior Brother Yan Kong, but you don’t have the guts to stand out?!”

“Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, come and die!”

““Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, come and die!”” Everyone from the Profound Sky Sect was furious, hoping that they could skin Lin Yun alive.

“Hahaha! Gu Ruochen? You’re still not enough to protect him. Today, I, Qin Tian, will be taking his life!” Qin Tian roared, not giving anyone the time to respond. He stomped his foot on the ground, shattering the air beneath his foot, and dashed forth; his speed immediately caused a series of exclamations from everyone in the surroundings.

Before anyone from the Sword Sect could respond, a figure appeared before Qin Tian. This person was a woman in disguise, and her voluptuous figure gave away her gender. When she got close to Qin Tian, she shook the fan in her hand, and a crimson lake appeared behind her.

A bridge at the heart of the lake with a crimson moon rising to the sky created the perfect scene as she stood on the bridge. After closing the fan, it shot out like a crimson streak, aimed at Qin Tian’s chest.

“Who are you?!” Everyone, including the Sword Sect’s disciples, was shocked by this person’s appearance. After all, this person actually dared to stand out against Qin Tian.

But Lin Yun naturally recognized this person with a gaze. Based on her figure and that fan alone, who else could she be if she wasn’t An Liuyan? She was a genius, to begin with. After she refined the White Dragon Bone, her potential had been given a significant boost; otherwise, she wouldn’t be given the identity of a Nine-Star Demon Venerable.

In her hands, the Profound Moon Fan unleashed the true power of an inheritance saint artifact.

“You’re courting death!” Qin Tian snorted. But he didn’t stop his momentum and raised his palm, pushing forth.

When the palm and fan struck each other, Qin Tian’s palm struck An Liuyan’s shoulder while An Liuyan’s fan struck Qin Tian’s chest, causing two dragon roars to echo. An Liuyan had a white dragon shrouding her, and Qin Tian had a golden dragon around him as dragon auras swept out from them.

““Divine Dragon Bone?”” An Liuyan and Qin Tian spoke out at the same time. The stalemate lasted for a brief second before they both retreated. An Liuyan had blood dripping down her lip, but Qin Tian didn’t seem injured.

“Hmph. Demon Gate’s demoness? You must be courting death!” Qin Tian dashed forth with the Divine Golden Dragon’s aura, entering the lake that gave birth to the crimson moon.

They swiftly clashed together, and they fell into a stalemate just like that. In the intense confrontation, the black robe that An Liuyan wore was torn to pieces, revealing her voluptuous figure and causing a series of exclamations from the surrounding. They all had shock in their pupils when they looked at An Liuyan.

An Liuyan had no change in her expression, but flowers bloomed in her pupils' depths. Before Qin Tian could even respond, he was already trapped in an illusion. When he looked around, he could only see crimson fans in the surroundings that forged this illusion.

There was an An Liuyan standing on each fan, dancing around. Her voluptuous figure eluded a dreamy and mysterious charm.

Qin Tian tried his best to keep his consciousness, but a fan still left a wound on his cheek. Rubbing the blood off his cheek, Qin Tian flew into a rage and unleashed his dragon origin, “Get lost!”

As all the fans shattered, the illusion was forcibly broken. Qin Tian then raised his hand and pushed a palm forth, destroying the phenomenon created by An Liuyan.

“Hmph. So the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple only knows how to hide behind a woman?” Qin Tian sneered, and his aura grew.

“Why are you here?” Lin Yun asked, helping An Liuyan back on her feet and ignoring Qin Tian’s words.

“I can’t watch him kill you. So I probed his strength for you, but it’s a pity that I can only confirm that he’s at the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm and has a Golden Dragon Bone.” An Liuyan smiled with a pale face.

Everyone could hear what An Liuyan said, and they turned to look at Qin Tian with shock. After all, wasn’t it a little too terrifying for Qin Tian to be at the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm? He wasn’t even thirty and already had such terrifying cultivation. It’s no wonder why he didn’t place the holy lands in his eyes.

“Treat your injuries, first.” Lin Yun took a deep breath and sent An Liuyan to the Sword Sect’s party before stepping forth.

“Lin Yun, at least you’re still a man!” Qin Tian smiled. “You dug out my younger brother’s dragon bone back on the Profound Wither Island, so I’ll make you feel what he suffered.”

“You are too overconfident. I’m just afraid that your Profound Sky Sect doesn’t have enough Golden Dragon Bones for me to dig out!” Lin Yun said.

“How dare you!” Qin Tian roared and dashed forth, wanting to suppress Lin Yun with one palm.

Seeing this, Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to circulate the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra and lift the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron hidden within his dragon origin ocean. As forty thousand dragon runes poured into his right hand, he faced Qin Tian’s attack head-on.

When the two dragon claws collided, they both retreated. Lin Yun took ten steps back, while Qin Tian merely took one step back.

“The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra?” Qin Tian was surprised because the dragon origin in his attack was being eroded by nether energy. This made him wonder what stage Lin Yun reached in the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. Wasn’t it long rumored that no one could practice the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra? He thought about many things in just a split second, including how Yan Kong lost.

“The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra is long lost, so I’m surprised you can reach this height. But I’m curious if you can withstand the Profound Sky Canon at the tenth stage!” Qin Tian charged forth once more after he stabilized his footing.

When he dashed forth, a silver moon and golden sun rose behind him. When Qin Tian raised his arm, a draconic roar echoed from within his body, while he began to emit a golden radiance. As his hair violently fluttered, it looked like a Divine Dragon had come to life from his body.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Sun-Moon Glory!” Qin Tian roared and threw a punch out. His punch was like a massive dragon roar accompanied by a sun and a moon. When he threw his punch out, the sheer force of his punch caused the surrounding space to tremble.

As countless golden dragons exploded, this made Qin Tian look like the king of divine dragons, and the aura he was emitting became terrifying. Facing the aura that Qin Tian was giving off, everyone felt like they were suffocating, while dumbfoundedly looking at him. This was because Qin Tian was too strong. How could Qin Tian possibly be this strong? Wasn’t Tian Xuanzi too powerful to nurture such a heaven-defying disciple?

But Lin Yun didn’t panic when facing Qin Tian’s attack. He started to form seals. Whenever he formed a seal, his dragon aura would increase one-fold, and his heart pumped like a cauldron producing vitality. In a split second, the dragon aura he gave off had multiplied thirty-nine times.

After his dragon aura multiplied thirty-nine times, he forced Qin Tian to show himself. Under the immense dragon aura he gave off, Qin Tian’s movements had become slow.

But Lin Yun didn’t stop there and executed the Blue Dragon Seal, White Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal, and Sovereign Dragon Seal. As one ancient seal after another took form in Lin Yun’s hand, a draconic roar echoed when he pushed them forth.

When Lin Yun and Qin Tian’s attacks collided in mid-air, a terrifying shockwave swept out that caused heaven and earth to tremble. When the cloud of dust gradually died down, they were both hovering in the air, facing off.

“Ha!” Qin Tian smirked. “I have been invincible in the Ancient Barren Domain amongst the same generation, so I’m surprised you can take two head-on attacks from me.”

“Invincible?” Lin Yun smiled. “Yan Kong also said that. Today, I want to see who dares claim to be invincible before Flower Burial!”

Flower Burial referred to him and his sword. As fighting spirits blazed within his pupils, everyone watching them felt a chill run down their spines. This could be an indirect face-off between the Radiant Sword Saint and Tian Xuanzi, so this battle meant a lot.

After today, the true owner of the Ancient Barren Domain would be determined, and everyone felt that they were witnessing a chapter of history.
