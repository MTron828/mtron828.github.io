Chapter 1466 - Absolute Annihilation

Lin Yun’s sudden appearance immediately drew everyone’s attention. The disciples participating in the Five Peaks Competition, as well as the Dragon Pulse Realm disciples on the Celestial Observing Stage, were surprised.

Since Lin Yun came so quickly, this meant that he didn’t collect any Azure Lotus Sword Flowers along the way, and Lin Yun’s objective was pretty clear at this point. He was aiming for the champion position, and realizing this made everyone’s face change because Lin Yun was too bold.

“What is Lin Yun trying to do? Is he trying to compete for the champion position?” Mu Qingqing’s face changed beside Mu Xueqin while covering her mouth. Lin Yun was simply too impulsive.He would have to face Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan if he wanted to obtain the champion position.

Lin Yun was only at the two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, so wasn’t he courting death by facing the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking? Even Mu Xueqin’s face changed. But unlike Mu Qingqing, she had some anticipation flashing in her pupils.

“Perhaps I can see miracles on him.” Mu Xueqin said softly.

“That’s impossible!” It was Mu Qingqing’s turn to be in disbelief. She knew Lin Yun would shine at this event but she only expected Lin Yun to make it into the top ten. She never thought of the possibility of him becoming the champion. After all, Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi were much stronger than him.

“Big Sister, did you discover something? Can you share it with me?” Mu Qingqing asked. But Mu Xueqin ignored her. Her attention was still on Lin Yun.

The peak masters were also shocked, and the four peak masters instantly understood what Mu Xuankong meant before. According to the rules, it was hard for Lin Yun to make it into the top ten, but it wasn’t impossible. After all, wasn’t the champion part of the top ten?

“Senior Brother, you really dare to imagine.” Huangfu Jue said as he looked at Mu Xuankong.

“Let’s just wait and see.” Mu Xuankong smiled.

On the Celestial Observing Lake, where there were fifth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flowers, thousands of people simultaneously stopped and looked in the same direction with disbelief and shock.

“He’s not planning to compete for the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower, right?”

But just before Lin Yun could make a move, four figures flew out from the fog and landed before him. They didn’t have any injuries and were emitting a terrifying sword aura. They took the initiative to exit the core region, and when the light wrapping them dissipated, an uproar broke throughout the surroundings upon the appearances of those four people.

The Azure Firmament Peak’s Huangfu Yan, tenth on the Earth Ranking!

The Golden Firmament Peak’s Zhang Jue, eighth on the Earth Ranking!

The Indigo Firmament Peak’s Luo Chendong, seventh on the Earth Ranking!

The Scarlet Firmament Peak’s Wang Cheng, third on the Earth Ranking!

The four were experts on the Earth Ranking without exception, especially Wang Cheng, who was ranked third. When they appeared and stood before Lin Yun, it was needless to say what they were doing.

“I’m really honored to have four geniuses of the Earth Ranking here to stop me.” Lin Yun said after sweeping his gaze over.

Wang Cheng smiled. “Brother Lin, you’re too polite. You’re a heaven direct disciple, and we’re incomparable to you in terms of our status!”

His remark was sarcastic, and Lin Yun wanted to call him out for being shameless.

Huangfu Yan snickered, “You’re really arrogant for trying to aim for the champion position when you’re not even in the top ten. Why don’t you take a look at yourself? Do you think you’re worthy? Do you really think that you’re a heaven direct disciple? Do you want to compete with the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking? You’re simply dreaming!”

Just when everyone thought Lin Yun was finished, a terrifying aura suddenly exploded from him with a pressure that made the surrounding lake tremble. As ripples spread out on the lake, it made some people stagger with their sword auras showing signs of collapse.

When they looked at Lin Yun, they could see that his hair and clothes were fluttering in the wind as a seed of the Twelve-Petaled Netherflower appeared. It was like the eye of the death gods from hell. That was the Nether Sword Seed, a sign that Lin Yun had reached the pinnacle of the third stage in the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

This surprised everyone because they hadn’t heard of anyone reaching the pinnacle of the third stage in the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra while being at the Elysium Core Realm. Many Divine Firmament Peak’s disciples couldn’t even reach that height in the Dragon Pulse Realm, which was why the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra became obsolete.

Even Jian Jingtian didn’t pick the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra back then. So how did Lin Yun manage to do it? This made the faces of Huangfu Yan and the other three change as their footsteps stopped, with shock revealed in their eyes.

As a cold light flashed through Lin Yun’s pupils, he sneered, “Since you people think so highly of me, I’ll let you guys know why I’m a heaven direct disciple. I’ll let you guys see if I’m worthy of it!”

As Lin Yun raised his brow, he dashed forth. No one thought that Lin Yun would take the initiative to attack when facing four experts from the Earth Ranking. As the Twelve-Petaled Netherflower revolved, it filled Lin Yun’s body with nether energy, and he threw a punch at Huangfu Yan.

“You’re courting death!” A ruthless light flashed through Huangfu Yan’s pupils. Since he previously suffered a loss in Lin Yun’s hands, he didn’t hesitate to summon his constellation right from the start before throwing a punch.

When the two punches collided, the azure sword rays around Huangfu Yan began to corrode before he could even circulate his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. Most of his sword aura was eroded in the blink of an eye before it finally collapsed.

Practically in a split second, Lin Yun’s punch easily crushed Huangfu Yan’s attack before his fist aimed at Huangfu Yan’s chest under the latter’s shocked gaze. But just when Lin Yun’s punch was about to land on Huangfu Yan, Lin Yun opened his palm and slammed it against Huangfu Yan’s chest, easily leaving a palm print that caved his chest in by half an inch.

Everyone’s minds went blank when they saw this scene. They were too shocked while watching Huangfu Yan being sent flying away.

“You are weak.” Lin Yun commented as Huangfu Yan fell into the lake. This was something that no one had expected. They didn’t expect Huangfu Yan, who was ranked tenth on the Earth Ranking, could be unable to even take a single move from Lin Yun.

Even if Huangfu Yan was careless, it was undeniable that Lin Yun was strong. They suddenly thought about the absolute annihilation of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, and their faces changed. They all knew about it, but everyone only regarded it as a joke this whole time.

After all, the Divine Firmament Peak was ranked at the bottom of the Five Peaks Competition Tournament every year, and not even Jian Jingtian chose the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra back then. This made everyone feel a chill down their spines because the power of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra had exceeded their imaginations. They realized that the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra was incredibly powerful, it’s just that no one managed to bring out the full power before Lin Yun.

“Draw your swords! Try not to come in contact with the nether energy!” Wang Cheng’s face changed as he yelled. As the remaining three drew their swords, they no longer looked down on Lin Yun.

As lightning crackled, a dazzling light shone that forced Lin Yun to close his eyes just as he stood firmly on the ground. It was Luo Chendong who charged over with the Indigo Firmament Sword Sutra. When lightning crackled at the sword's tip, it made Lin Yun feel a chill down his spine.

But it didn’t stop there, Zhang Yue descended from the sky with his sword slashing down. A scarlet sun also rose on the lake’s surface, unleashing a terrifying heat as Wang Cheng made his move. The three didn’t hesitate to push their sword sutras to the limit, creating three different phenomenons.

The phenomenon's scale had exceeded everyone's imaginations, and Lin Yun had to face the full power of three sword auras in a split second. It didn’t take long for the Twelve-Petaled Netherflower to shatter into fragments, and Lin Yun couldn’t unleash the power of the nether energy. When there was a slight opportunity, Wang Chen mercilessly swung his sword, not giving Lin Yun any chance to use his nether energy. After all, they had witnessed how Huangfu Yan was defeated.

“It has come to an end now!” When Lin Yun’s aura fell, a cold light flashed in Wang Cheng’s pupils, wanting to inflict heavy injuries on Lin Yun. The fight between experts was fast, and every moment counts. If they gave Lin Yun an opportunity, one of them might be like Huangfu Yan.

A bright sun appeared behind Lin Yun without any prior warnings. Just when everyone felt that the sun would collide with Lin Yun, a bizarre scene occurred. A person was walking out of the sun. This person was Wang Cheng. He thrust his sword, aiming at Lin Yun’s chest, while the other two divided Lin Yun’s attention.

Everything took place too quickly, seemingly unexpected and simultaneously reasonable. After all, Wang Cheng was ranked third on the Earth Ranking, and they were fighting Lin Yun three against one. So how could they allow Lin Yun to turn the tables around?
