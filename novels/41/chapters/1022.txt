Chapter 1023 - Pig Trotters

Everyone could feel the suffocating pressure from the Realm Sons. It motivated them to follow their orders and capture Lin Yun. As long as they found Lin Yun, they could obtain 1,000 Divine Astral Pellets.

But most people felt uneasy about attacking Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun could injure the Profound Lightning Twin Swords and kill the geniuses of the war realms. He wasn’t easily bullied.

Most importantly, a lot of people didn’t like the Ten War Realms. The war realms had always acted unruly, which annoyed everyone else. If it wasn’t for the fact that the war realms were too powerful, they would have rebelled against them.

Even the higher realms couldn’t stand the war realms. When news of Lin Yun killing the war realms spread, many people rejoiced. They were filled with admiration for Lin Yun. If possible, they even wished for Lin Yun to escape the Yellow Sandy Plain.

Although they knew that the chances of this happening weren’t high, they still wanted to see it happen. However, they wouldn’t wait around to see what happened. After all, the war realms were increasing their brutality after the most recent news.

As chaos ensued, the conflict between both sides continued to accumulate. But no matter how the situation changed in the Yellow Sandy Plain, Lin Yun would calmly increase his strength. He was currently in a barren land with Pei Xue, so it would be hard for anyone to find him if he suppressed his aura.

Pei Xue was currently treating her injuries while Lin Yun was looking through some jade slips. He was examining the jade slips from the war realms. He was interested in the foundation of the war realms and their secret technique of planting runes in aura oceans.

If Lin Yun didn’t have the Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans, he might be suppressed by those geniuses. Take Luo Chen for example, his talent wasn’t any weaker than the servants of the war realms, but he was still suppressed by them. If it wasn’t for the runes, the Profound Lightning Twin Swords might not be able to defeat anyone.

“Spirit Planting Art!” Lin Yun muttered as his eyes flickered. So it turns out that the secret technique was called the Spirit Planting Art. It engraved a blood jade into the violet palace and nourished it with treasures. After reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm, the blood jade would manifest runes in the aura oceans.

Then again, there was a huge risk with this secret technique because there was a possibility that the blood jade would shatter and kill the cultivator. But if one managed to succeed, there were a lot of benefits. According to the information on the blood jade, the Ten War Realms had similar secret techniques. In fact, all of the Realm Sons had saint runes planted in their aura oceans.

This was the huge difference between them and the servants. This was also the reason why there was a huge difference in their aura. The Spirit Planting Art’s ultimate goal was to allow them to make it through the baptism successfully. After reaching a certain cultivation, the Demonic Astral Flowers would replace the saint runes in aura oceans.

According to the jade slip, only one out of ten million people could undergo the Demonic Astral Flowers’ baptism. Lin Yun didn’t doubt it because he had also undergone life and death through baptism. In fact, he wasn’t even sure how he made it through. Although it was a dangerous process, it wasn’t so dangerous that one out of ten million would make it out.

Then again, this was also because there was a huge difference in his foundation and the Realm Sons. Plus, it was all thanks to the Azure Dragon True Bone that he survived.

“I see…no wonder they want to come after me. It seems like I underestimated the Azure Dragon True Bone,” muttered Lin Yun. It was a shame that the Azure Dragon Saint Art was only at lesser mastery in the first stage.

Divine Astral Pellets didn’t seem to be effective with the Azure Dragon Saint Art. The Azure Dragon Saint Art only responded to treasures with boundless vitality or beast cores from powerful demonic beasts. Unfortunately, those treasures were hard to acquire for Lin Yun.

Collecting his thoughts, Lin Yun tossed the jade slip to the side because it didn’t have much use to him. The Spirit Planting Art required the assistance of a Heavenly Spiritualist and blood jades, which were extremely precious. Heavenly Spiritualists were a lot more terrifying than Saint Spiritualists, so it wouldn’t be easy for him to find one.

Lin Yun then turned to look at Pei Xue who was treating her injuries. Her aura wasn’t stable probably because she had fought a powerful enemy. Otherwise, she would have recovered by now. Lin Yun knew that she had many secrets, so he decided to help her. Plus, he wanted to know where Yue Weiwei was and why the Divine Blood Fruits were so important.

Seeing that Pei Xue was recovering from her injuries, Lin Yun didn’t disrupt her. Instead, he told Lil’ Red to keep watch.

“The spiritual runes engraved in the bodies of the generals are extremely high grade. I have to hurry up or I might not be able to leave the Yellow Sandy Plain.” Then, Lin Yun retrieved dozens of Divine Astral Pellets.

A silver Iris Flower suddenly bloomed underneath Lin Yun. The Azure Firmament Sword Sutra had already reached complete mastery, but the Iris Sword Art was still stuck in the thirteenth stage. Lin Yun sat with his legs crossed and shut his eyes.

Just like that, three days passed in the blink of an eye. When Pei Xue opened her eyes, her complexion was improved. She looked as bewitching as before.

When Pei Xue turned to look at Lin Yun, he was practicing a certain fist technique that made a Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix fly around.

There was a huge difference between the two phenomena, but they seemed to complement each other. Pei Xue was captivated by Lin Yun’s performance as light shined in her eyes. It looked like Lin Yun made a breakthrough in his sword sutra, the Divine Glorysun Fist, and the Divine Glorymoon Fist.

How the hell is this possible?! Pei Xue’s eyes were filled with shock. She still remembered how she told Lin Yun that it was impossible for anyone to grasp the holy spirit martial technique in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

At this moment, a brilliant sword hum echoed out as Lin Yun held the Flower Burial Sword. Under Pei Xue’s gaze, Lin Yun executed his fist techniques.

Occasionally, moonlight and sunlight would shine while his sword moved. When he landed on the ground, the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix shrouded him. As Lin Yun returned the Flower Burial Sword to its sheath, the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix phenomena disappeared. At this moment, Pei Xue was sure that Lin Yun had grasped the basics of a holy spirit martial technique. But Lin Yun was only in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm, which didn’t make sense.

When Pei Xue saw Lin Yun walk over, her face started to blush. She had no idea why she was reacting like this. Suddenly, Lin Yun stopped walking and locked his brows. Pei Xue became even more nervous as she lowered her head, not daring to look at Lin Yun.

“What’s going on with your face? You look like a red pig,” said Lin Yun.

When Pei Xue heard that, her eyes widened with disbelief. When she recovered from her shock, she pointed at Lin Yun and spoke with her voice trembling, “Y-y-you’re the pig! You idiot! You rogue! All you men are pigs!”
