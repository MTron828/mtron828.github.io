Chapter 2147: Chaotic Battle (1)

Everyone turned to look at He Xuanjing after hearing his harsh words. But He Xuanjing merely sneered at them, not bothered by their gazes. He was genuinely unhappy with Mu Qianjue, who picked the Azure Dragon Path instead of the other Divine Dragon Paths. That clearly meant that Mu Qianjue felt that he was the weakest among them all, especially after Mu Qianjue said that there were differences among the fellow champions of the Heavenly Paths.

He Xuanjing didn’t conceal his emotions at all. He was clearly saying that Mu Qianjue deserved it from his expression. He had a strong stance. Knowing what these geniuses from the Eastern Desolation were thinking, he said, “You guys don’t have to look at me in this manner. Make your move if you want to chase me away from the throne. I’m waiting right here. Do you guys think that I’m the weakest? Don’t blame me for being ruthless, then.”

Everyone fell into silence and the surrounding atmosphere became tense. Ji Zixi who was glaring at Lin Yun squinted as she looked at He Xuanjing.

“Champion of a Heavenly Path, how impressive,” Ji Zixi said coldly, not tolerating He Xuanjing at all.

“Likewise. I have long heard of the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Little Princess,” He Xuanjing refuted. He then looked at the Dao Yang Holy Son, and said, “The Twin Stars of the Eastern Desolation can come at me together. You can also get Ye Qingtian to join you guys since I’m fearless. Since I dared to choose the Azure Dragon Path, I naturally don’t put you guys in my eyes.”

The other holy sons from the Eastern Desolation frowned unhappily and the atmosphere became even more tense. It felt as though a battle would take place the next second.

Ji Zixi looked at the Dao Yang Holy Son, and said, “Can you put up with him?”

The Dao Yang Holy Son was calm and smiled, “There’s no need to hurry. We can wait for daylight before we fight.”

Ji Zixi was unhappy, but she didn’t say anything about it. It was the middle of the night, and the various Dragon Mountains were calm. The battles during the day were too bloody, so they had to ease up at night. The battle for the Dragon’s Head would end at noon, so it was still early to continue.

After Mu Qianjue decisively jumped down from the Dragon’s Head, the tense atmosphere on the Blue Dragon Mountain also calmed down a little. Everyone sat with their legs crossed to absorb the dragon aura on the dragon mountains and digest their comprehension.

There were many battles to observe, and everyone greatly benefited from the surrounding battles. That was especially the case with Ye Qingtian and Mu Qianjue’s battles. Ye Qingtian showed the grace of a swordsman, and many people greatly benefited from watching their battles.

“Are you still alright?” Dao Yang Holy Son asked, looking at Lin Yun. He noticed that Lin Yun had some wounds on him, but the blood had already dried up and he looked fine. But the Dao Yang Holy Son wasn’t asking Lin Yun about that. He meant that Lin Yun still hadn’t grasped any saint dao, and greater dao would have penetrated his body. Greater dao wasn’t something that could be erased so easily.

These injuries that couldn’t be seen were the most serious. The reason why he didn’t want to fight with He Xuanjing earlier was mainly because of his concern for Lin Yun’s condition, fearing that the latter would be impulsive and fight with others again.

“I’m fine,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Alright. You stay here and don’t go anywhere. This is an order from me as the Dao Yang Holy Son. ? Obediently stay on the Azure Dragon Path if you still consider yourself to be the chief disciple of the Indigothunder Peak,” Dao Yang Holy Son smiled.

Lin Yun smiled, feeling a warmth in his heart, and he teased, “Holy Son, how overbearing.”

“Don’t talk back. The Dao Yang Holy Son is right. Stay on the Azure Dragon Path and don’t go anywhere,” Xin Yan said as she came over and glared at Lin Yun.

Bai Shuying spoke out as well, “It’s better for you to calm down a little. Don’t think that you’re really invincible.”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled but didn’t dare to say anything else. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Dao Yang Holy Son smiled, “I’ll leave it to the two holy maidens to look after him. Get him to rest quickly.”

The two women nodded and stood beside Lin Yun with no intention of avoiding suspicion.

Lin Yun’s face sank and placed his hand on his face. He actually wanted to play with He Xuanjing, but he had no choice now because he couldn’t offend either woman. He had no choice but to obediently rest. What the Dao Yang Holy Son said was right. He did need some rest after facing saint dao.

The Dao Yang Holy Son looked at the reluctance on Lin Yun’s face, and laughed, “You have no idea how many people are envious of you being accompanied by two holy maidens. You don’t know how blessed you are.”

When Lin Yun looked around, he noticed that the holy sons from the other holy lands within the Eastern Desolation looked at him unkindly. Some holy sons looked as though they wanted to give him a beating if they could. After all, he had two of the Heavenly Dao Sect’s holy maidens willingly guarding him.

“Don’t worry about it. I’ll guard you, and I’ll make sure no one will give you a beating,” the Dao Yang Holy Son rolled his eyes.

“I’m afraid that you’ll give me a beating, instead,” Lin Yun said.

“Well, I do have an intention to beat you up.”

Lin Yun shut his mouth and began to rest. The other holy lands were envious of the relationship among the Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples.

Ji Zixi blinked because Ye Qingtian didn’t seem to be as unreasonable as rumored. She noticed that it was true, and the Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples had a good relationship together.

As time passed, the nine Dragon Mountains fell into silence. Everyone knew that it was just the calm before the storm, and a battle would take place among the Dragon Mountains again at dawn. It would be an earth-shattering battle that no one could avoid.

Lin Yun sat with his legs crossed as his dragon’s blood boiled, and his saint aura coursed through his body. As the hot current flowed through his body, his internal organs started trembling. His injuries weren’t serious, and he was only recovering to his peak condition.

The Dao Yang Holy Son didn’t expect that the pinnacle complete mastery of the Astral Sword Intent could face greater dao head-on. As a result, the troubles from greater dao to Lin Yun’s physique had been greatly lessened.

Everyone was the same as the Dao Yang Holy Son. They all felt that there had to be a lot of greater dao energy accumulating within Lin Yun’s body, despite looking fine now, and he would suffer a backlash if he fought again.

Furthermore, expelling greater dao from his body wasn’t something that could be accomplished within a short time, and it was futile even if he had a powerful sword intent. But if they were really thinking of it that way, they would be underestimating his fighting prowess.

Lin Yun suddenly felt warmth on his face and saw that the sun was rising when he opened his eyes. As beams of sunlight tore through the darkness, the world was brightly lit once again.
