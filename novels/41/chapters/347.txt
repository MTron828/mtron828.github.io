Chapter 348 - Demonlotus Realm

When the rain stopped, Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale. The Scarletflame Tiger was still a ninth stage demonic beast. Lin Yun nearly died from the attack he suffered previously. He was lucky that the Scarletflame Tiger was already injured when he took an attack from it. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

He only achieved lesser mastery in the Dracophant War Armor, so it still wasn’t at the level it could withstand a cosmic artifact’s power. But if it wasn’t for the Dracophant War Armor, he would have been killed.

Lin Yun coughed a few times before he let out a long sigh. His complexion also became a bit better. When he looked at the beast core in his hand, his eyes flashed with excitement.

“My Dracophant Battle Physique just reached the fourth stage, so this overlord beast core came at the right time.” Upon reaching the later stages in the Dracophant Battle Physique, he would need the help of beast cores to cultivate.

Most body-refining martial techniques were derived from observing ancient beasts or divine beasts. After all, the physique of demonic beasts was much stronger than humans. Through refining beast cores, not only could he strengthen the Dracophant Battle Physique, but he could also increase the speed of his cultivation.

When the Dracophant Battle Physique reached the fifth stage, he would need a Violet Palace Realm beast core or he wouldn’t be able to make any more improvements. Half a day later, after Lin Yun had recovered from his injuries, Lin Yun finally started to refine the Scarletflame Tiger’s beast core.

The beast core was filled with sun and moon essence while also holding a hint of demonic aura. But both of the essences were beneficial to him. When he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, a suction force came from Lin Yun’s body that drew the essence and aura into his body. In the next second, the origin energy within his body surged. The crimson demonic aura was charging around his meridians.

Behave! Lin Yun snorted coldly. When he circulated the Dracophant Battle Physique, the violent demonic aura calmed down. After all, how could it compare to the ancient dracophant? Even if the Scarletflame Tiger was alive, it would tremble in fear if it ran into an ancient dracophant.

Right now, the demonic aura could only be obediently absorbed and refined by Lin Yun. As Lin Yun gradually refined more demonic aura, the faint purple dracophant energy gradually turned red. At the same time, there was a hint of violent killing intent contained in his aura. Vaguely, this made Lin Yun’s dracophant energy different from the Primal Origin Sect’s standard dracophant energy.

The red dracophant energy felt even more terrifying. In fact, this was its original form. The ancient dracophant were known as barbaric beasts. They weren’t benevolent beings and ferocity was part of their nature.

The essence and aura contained in a ninth stage beast core was so great that there was enough for Lin Yun to refine over the next ten days. This was possible because Lin Yun had the Iris Sword Sutra. Otherwise, he would have had to spend at least a month to digest it completely.

Sensing the power that filled his body, Lin Yun punched the ground. Along with a huge explosion, three huge cracks spread out on the ground. In the process, the cracks separated into countless smaller cracks.

“Three cauldron’s worth of power!” Lin Yun revealed a satisfied expression. This beast core stabilized his Dracophant Battle Physique in the fourth stage and allowed him to possess three cauldron’s worth of strength.

At the same time, his cultivation had also improved and reached the mid seventh stage of the Profound Martial Realm. All he could say was that the essence contained in the beast core was too massive.

Then again, this was also the first time he refined an overlord beast core. If he did it again, the effects wouldn’t be as fruitful.

“This should be a treasured land for cultivation. I’ll just stay here to comprehend sword intent.” Lin Yun looked at the barren land and he could see magma flowing out of the ground occasionally. The environment was harsh, but the spiritual energy here was dense. This was also the reason why the Scarletflame Tiger occupied this place.

Lin Yun’s gaze landed on the mountain and he headed for it. It didn’t take long for him to arrive at the summit. When he arrived, his eyes lit up because there was a fruit that was currently being grown.

“The Blazecloud Fruit?” Lin Yun instantly recognized the fruit. It could be used to refine pellets or it could be consumed directly. It was extremely beneficial to cultivators who cultivated fire-attribute cultivation techniques. This was probably how the Scarletflame Tiger could summon fireballs when it roared.

It was a pity that it wasn’t compatible with Lin Yun. However, it was rather compatible with the Dragon Blooded Horse. Lin Yun smiled and he stored the fruit.

“I’ll just settle here.” There was no other place more suitable than his new spot. Placing the ancient sword box to the side, Lin Yun started to try and make a breakthrough in the xiantian sword intent. At the same time, many of the Sword Firmament Pavilion elders gathered together, along with Guardian Plum.

“The Demonlotus Realm will open in two months and we have ten quotas. Who do you think we should send?” asked Guardian Plum.

Upon hearing the Demonlotus Realm was opening, the faces of the Sword-Bearing Elders and many other Elders changed. All of them began to hesitate and they didn’t dare to answer immediately. The Demonlotus Realm was dangerous and one out of ten would die there. If they were unlucky, half of their disciples would die or maybe even all of them might.

Then again, the benefits of the Demonlotus Realm were too great. Upon killing demonic beasts in the realm, their beast core would turn into a black lotus. The black lotus was demonic, but it was a pure essence after it got rid of its demonic traits. Even disciples in the late phase of the Profound Martial Realm could make a breakthrough relying on it.

After reaching the seventh stage, it would be hard to make a breakthrough. Even if you were blessed with extraordinary talent or resources, it would still take a long time to make a breakthrough.

But demonlotus were extremely precious and it could save any cultivator about three to five years of time. However, the fact remained that the Demonlotus Realm was dangerous.

“Guardian Plum, I feel that we shouldn’t send any of our disciples on the Heaven Ranking. After all, it’ll be a huge loss to the sect if any one of them dies,” said a Sword-Bearing Elder.

“That’s right. We shouldn’t send them.”

“Then we’ll have to pick from the Earth Ranking. The top ten in the Earth Ranking are all stuck in the eighth stage, so they’re probably willing to take this risk.”

“I still think that we should send one of our Heaven Ranking’s disciples. Otherwise, we will lose our advantage against the other sects.”

“That’s true. There are many treasures in the Demonlotus Realm that are extremely important to the sect.” The discussions lasted for a long time before everyone made up their mind to send one Heaven Ranked disciple.

Guardian Plum didn’t have any objections against it because that was roughly what he decided as well. There was no need for the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm to enter because the demonlotus wasn’t helpful in the breakthrough to the Violet Palace Realm. Instead, they could send a disciple in the ninth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. That disciple could fight for the opportunity to make a breakthrough and the Sword Firmament Pavilion wouldn’t lose when fighting against the other sects.

But Guardian Plum still had something to add. He looked around and said, “We have to add someone to the team. Lin Yun has to go there.”

The hall went silent for a long time before someone spoke out, “I-Isn’t that inappropriate? Lin Yun is only in the seventh stage of the Profound Martial Realm. Plus, it will be a great loss to the sect if he dies in there.”

“Yeah. Lin Yun’s worth isn’t any lower than any of the disciples on the Heaven Ranking.”

“We can’t afford to take this risk. With his talent and aptitude, he doesn't need this opportunity.”

Guardian Plum expected that everyone would object, but he still smiled, “This is something that the Pavilion Master decided.”

The Pavilion Master’s decision? The Sword-Bearing Elders were shocked. The Pavilion Master was usually in seclusion and rarely showed himself. He practically didn’t care about the sect’s affairs at all. Naturally, they were shocked that the Pavilion Master would desire for Lin Yun to go to the Demonlotus Realm.

When Guardian Plum said that, no one objected to the matter anymore. But someone spoke up to remind him, “Guardian Plum, I’m afraid that Lin Yun won’t be able to convince everyone with his cultivation in the seventh stage.”

“That’s his problem then. If he can’t even resolve this much trouble, then there’s no need for him to enter the Demonlotus Realm,” smiled Guardian Plum.
