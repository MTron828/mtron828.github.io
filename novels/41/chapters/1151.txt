Chapter 1152 - Death of Elysium Core!

Everyone looked at Lin Yun in shock for a long time. With the corpse on the ground, they had no more disdain towards Lin Yun.

Even Qin Feng was completely dumbfounded. He wanted Luo Kui to use his constellation to kill Lin Yun, but Lin Yun was too fast.

Lin Yun’s monstrous talent made everyone wonder when the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect became so terrifying.

A Heavenly Soul Realm slaying an Astral Stage had exceeded all understanding. Even Ye Ziling, who thought she understood Lin ,Yun was baffled. Is this the true strength of a champion who reigned over a Heavenly Path?

As reality hit, Ye Ziling couldn’t fathom what kind of existence the Heavenly Path was. In her mind, the Heavenly Path had to be worse than hell. If it wasn’t, the champion wouldn’t be so terrifying.

“Who else wishes to stand in my way?” Lin Yun said, suppressing his injuries and chaotic aura. When he swept his glance out, it felt as though he was standing at the top of the summit looking down on everyone.

Lin Yun’s actions made the demonic cultivators hesitate. The situation was too strange for them. Although Lei Ying had given them a lot of promises, Luo Kui was dead. So there was a chance that they would also die.

A brief moment later, a few demonic cultivators left because they no longer wanted to be involved in this matter. As for Qin Feng, he couldn’t accept that Lin Yun had killed Luo Kui because he had a good friendship with Luo Kui.

He only recovered from his shock after several demonic cultivators left. After all, the task given to him by Lei Ying was to hold back the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party and keep the origin stone on the island.

But with the demonic cultivators leaving, it was impossible for his formation to hold back Ye Ziling’s group. With a cold light flashing across his pupils, Qin Feng looked at Lin Yun, “Who the hell are you?”

“Just a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect,” smiled Lin Yun. He could tell that Luo Kui’s death had affected Qin Feng greatly, causing the latter to panic. With so many demonic cultivators gone, the situation had turned better for them.

“Qin Feng, leave. Luo Kui has already died, and there’s no way you can stop us,” said Ye Ziling coldly.

“What should we do now? The other demonic cultivators aren’t reliable at all!” Xiao Kun’s eyes flashed with panic when he transmitted his voice to Qin Feng. His words also made Qin Feng hesitate.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk…” Right at this moment, an eerie laughter sounded out that sent chills down everyone’s spine. Lei Ying was here!

When the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party raised their heads, they saw a figure enveloped in demonic flames on a stone pillar a few hundred feet away.

At this moment, Lei Ying was holding a head in each hand. Then, he tossed them to the ground, causing Liu Yuan to exclaim, “The Elders!”

Once the heads rolled on the ground, Liu Yuan was certain that they belonged to the two Elysium Core Realm elders from the campsite. At this moment, his entire world turned dark.

He couldn’t believe that the elders were dead. Although the elders were only in the lesser Elysium Core Realm, they were still Elysium Core Realm experts.

Fear loomed over the hearts of everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. They couldn’t imagine how strong Lei Ying was since he killed two elders. It didn’t make sense because his cultivation was supposed to be in the quasi-Elysium Core Realm.

“Boss Lei!” The demonic cultivators cupped their hands after recovering from their shock. They knew how terrifying Lei Ying was. After all, he was ranked first in the Profound Wither Sea, having grasped the lightning and flame intent.

Lin Yun knew that it was too late for them to do anything. He initially planned to escape the island with everyone after killing Luo Kui, but it was impossible to do that now that Lei Ying arrived.

Lei Ying was emitting great pressure as he stood on the pillar. He had always been cautious of the four major sects, which is why they let him live. However, if they knew that he was capable of killing an expert in the Elysium Core Realm, they would have taken action against him a long time ago.

“You’re late.” Qin Feng looked at Lei Ying with a trace of anger in his tone. If Lei Ying had come earlier, Luo Kui wouldn’t have died.

“The elders of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect were stronger than I thought. I nearly failed my mission.” An indifferent voice sounded out from the demonic flames. However, he suddenly thought of something as he questioned Qin Feng, “Are you blaming me?”

Qin Feng immediately panicked when he heard that and replied, “I don’t dare… I don’t dare… I just have a deep friendship with Luo Kui and became a little emotional.

“Deep friendship…?” Lei Ying sneered which enveloped everyone in fear. Suddenly, the demonic flames enveloping him disappeared to reveal his appearance. Lei Ying wore a simple cloak while his face alternated between the color black and white.

Looking at Lei Ying, Lin Yun instantly recognized him as the demonic cultivator he pointed out when he first arrived on the island. However, no one cared about his worry back then.

Lin Yun saw blood in Lei Ying’s hands, which made it seem like he was injured. However, it seemed like he didn’t care if others knew that he was injured.

“I…” A peculiar smile rose on Lei Ying’s face before he grabbed onto Qin Feng’s throat.

“Spare me… Boss Lei, I’m sorry… I don’t want to die…” Qin Feng begged for his life while he suffocated.

“Don’t you guys have a good friendship? Why don’t you accompany him in hell? It appears that your friendship isn’t as good as you think. Let me ask you again, do you guys have a deep friendship?” Lei Ying said with a sinister smile.

“N-No! We don’t!” Qin Feng replied. At this moment, he didn’t have the prestige of a mighty demonic cultivator.

“Hehe, that’s right. You’re pretty honest…” Lei Ying loosened his grip on Qin Feng’s throat.

The other demonic cultivators let out a sigh of relief when they saw Lei Ying stop. After all, they felt a suffocating pressure when Qin Feng was getting choked.

“But I hate heartless people like you!” Lei Ying’s tone suddenly changed as he slapped Qin Feng. The slap was so hard that Qin Feng’s head exploded like a watermelon. Then, Qin Feng’s mutilated corpse fell to the ground.

Everything happened too quickly for anyone to react. At this moment, the demonic cultivators were shaking in fear. Even Lin Yun felt a trace of fear at the brutality of a genuine demonic cultivator.

Lin Yun wasn’t shocked by Lei Ying’s strength, but his mentality. Not even the Realm Sons could compare to Lei Ying’s brutality.

After Lei Ying killed Qin Feng, he turned to look at Xiao Kun and asked, “Who has the origin stone right now?”

“H-he does!” Xiao Kun’s tone trembled while he pointed his finger at Lin Yun.

“Oh?” Lei Ying turned to look at Lin Yun.

Suddenly, a voice sounded out that expelled everyone’s fear. “Disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, listen up!”

“We’re here!” Feng Zhang and the other disciples hollered.

“Right now, I’m ordering one as the Senior Sister of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect to retreat immediately! Protect Lin Yun and escort the origin stone back to the sect!” Ye Ziling yelled, causing everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect to be briefly stunned. Then, they obediently followed her command, fleeing without hesitation.

Lin Yun was still in a state of shock and was forcibly taken away by Liu Yuan. He was feeling conflicted as he turned back to look at Ye Ziling radiating with sword aura as she stood before the demonic cultivators.
