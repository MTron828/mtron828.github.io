Chapter 362 - Encountering Injustice

“The Black Lotus Palace?” Lin Yun looked at Feng Ye, “You seem to know quite a bit.”

“You’ve never heard of it?” Feng Ye was surprised to see that Lin Yun knew nothing about the Black Lotus Palace.

Lin Yun truly knew nothing about the Black Lotus Palace. He didn’t even have much information about the Demonlotus Realm to begin with. After all, he had been in seclusion, so he didn’t gather any information about the secret realm. Perhaps Tang Tong would know about the Black Lotus Palace.

“I thought you knew everything judging from how composed you looked. Since you didn’t take it too far earlier, I’ll be kind and explain it to you.”

Lin Yun got a rough idea of the Black Lotus Palace from Feng Ye’s quick explanation. The Black Lotus Palace was the most attractive place in the Demonlotus Realm.

It didn’t have a designated location and would appear randomly every time the Demonlotus Realm opened. The Black Lotus Palace was filled with countless treasures and you could even find cosmic artifacts there. In addition to that, the next thing that attracted everyone was the ancient Dao Insight Diagram.

There were many types of Dao Insight Diagrams. There were those created with sword patterns, ancient ominous beasts, and recorded grand phenomenons. The opportunity to comprehend in the Dao Insight Diagram was equivalent to a few years of bitter cultivation.

“I see…” Lin Yun knew that he had to go to the Black Lotus Palace. He hoped to look at the Dao Insight Diagram about swords to increase his sword intent or the Dao Insight Diagram about ancient ominous beasts to strengthen his Seven Profound Steps and Dracophant Battle Physique.

Knowing the possible benefits, he just had to go there. Feng Ye and Lin Yun weren’t the only ones who saw the natural phenomenon. Almost everyone in the Demonlotus Realm could see the black beam.

“The Black Lotus Palace is opening? Finally!”

“Hehe, I need to get a cosmic artifact from there.”

“It’s already good enough if I can observe the Dao Insight Diagram. But it’ll be even better if I can get a few pellets.”

“I should finally have some kind of harvest in the Black Lotus Palace…” The excitement from everyone in the Demonlotus Realm rose when they saw the black beam.

The Bloodbone Gate’s Mu Xiuhan was currently wiping the blood off his sword in a forest. He had just killed over a dozen people and all their throats were sliced open.

He suddenly raised his head to look at the black beam and licked his lips with an eerie smile, “The Black Lotus Palace is finally appearing. Finally, I get to kill experts instead of all this garbage.”

There were several Demonflame Sect’s disciples gathered in a damaged palace. All of them were surrounding one person.

“Senior Brother Bai Yue, the Black Lotus Palace is finally opening!”

“Senior Brother can start a massacre and snatch everyone’s harvest now!”

“Senior Brother, when are you moving out?” They were filled with confidence for their senior brother.

“There’s no need to start a massacre. But I’ll let those who go against me have a taste of what’s worse than death!” Bai Yue said, “Let’s go!”

Leading his disciples, they headed for the Black Lotus Palace.

In the depths of the mountain range, Jing Jue lazily opened his eyes that were blazing with fighting spirit. “The Black Lotus Palace is finally opening! Things are going to get interesting.”

He was only sixteen when he participated in the previous Dragon Gate Competition and left a deep impression on everyone when he came in nineteenth place. Because of his result, he was known as a genius swordsman. Now that three years had passed, it was uncertain just how much stronger he was.

He wasn’t fighting with his full strength with Xin Yan back then and he only left because he didn’t want to get involved with more troubles. In the end, Xin Yan and everyone else could only watch him leave and do nothing about it.

The disciples of the Heavenly Profound Sect, Demonic Moon Villa, Divine Guards, and Primal Origin Sect also saw the beam of light that pierced through the horizon. They all rushed towards the beam of light without any hesitation.

One could only imagine how many people would gather outside the Black Lotus Palace. There were many treasures there and it would turn into a brutal dogfight. In the end, those who wanted to try their luck would end up dead.

One had to rely on their strength if they wanted to survive until the end. The black beam of light was at least a few thousand meters away and Lin Yun wasn’t in a rush to hurry over. After all, the palace wouldn’t open until the light disappeared. Furthermore, gaining entrance into the palace depended on one’s strength. Without sufficient strength, there was no way you could keep the treasure even if you found one.

Feng Ye followed behind Lin Yun, examining Lin Yun occasionally. Whenever Lin Yun turned around, Feng Ye would start looking around, pretending to admire the scenery.

Lin Yun naturally knew what was on Feng Ye’s mind. Feng Ye probably wanted to rob him after recovering from all the injuries. But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by it because he also wanted to test his current strength. He still had no idea how strong he had gotten after he made a breakthrough and Feng Ye would be a decent opponent.

Seven days later, a group of eighth stage demonic beasts charged at Lin Yun out of nowhere. This made Feng Ye’s eyes light up. He had already recovered about 60% of his strength, which was good enough for him to attack Lin Yun.

Feng Ye’s eyes flashed coldly with a sinister smile and he quietly approached Lin Yun while circulating his origin energy. But before he could even get close to Lin Yun, he witnessed a shocking scene. Lin Yun unleashed ten-odd sword rays that instantly annihilated the demonic beasts.

The demonic beasts died before they could even finish their approach. This scene left Feng Ye shocked. He was so shocked that he even forgot to attack Lin Yun.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun turned around to look at Feng Ye and questioned, “What are you trying to do?”

Feng Ye was jolted awake and he started cursing in his heart. Since when did Lin Yun become so powerful? But when he saw Lin Yun’s indifferent face, he couldn’t help feeling guilty. Glancing at the Demonlotus Cores on the ground, Feng Ye suddenly had an idea and replied, “What the hell are you looking at? Can’t I help you pick up the Demonlotus Cores on the ground? Do you think that I’ll covet them? Who the hell do you think I am?”

Feng Ye stepped forward and picked up the Demonlotus Cores. When he handed them to Lin Yun, he muttered, “Why don’t you give me one since I helped you?”

“Dream on.” Lin Yun waved his hand and took all the Demonlotus Cores.

Feng Ye cursed inwardly when he saw all the Demonlotus Cores disappearing. He now hoped that he could recover faster so that he could rob Lin Yun. No matter how many Demonlotus Cores Lin Yun obtained, they ultimately belonged to him. Just thinking about it made Feng Ye chuckle out aloud.

“Why the hell are you walking so quickly? Wait for me!” Feng Ye chased after Lin Yun when he woke up from his daydream.

Five days later, Feng Ye finally recovered from his injuries. Once this happened, he avoided looking at Lin Yun. He was pondering how he could make his move, but it was a pity that he lost his confidence every time he witnessed Lin Yun’s strength.

He was losing his patience and was about to launch an attack when he heard sounds of people fighting nearby. The sounds came from people who were quietly concealing themselves. Lin Yun and Feng Ye saw three people attacking a woman. The woman was covered in sweat with cuts on her clothes.

When Lin Yun saw the baleful aura of the three, he instantly knew that they didn’t belong to the Great Qin Empire’s sects. The leader’s cultivation was in the ninth stage, while the other two were in the pinnacle eighth stage. There was no way the woman could fight the three of them by herself. In fact, she was being completely toyed with by the three of them.

Her? Lin Yun was surprised when he took a closer look at the woman.

“Hehe, look at how tender her skin is. She’s much better than the women in my mountain. I must bring her back to warm my bed…” chuckled Feng Ye.

“She’s the beloved daughter of the Divine Guards’ commander, Liu Feilong. Do you dare to snatch her?”

Feng Ye’s face instantly changed when he heard Lin Yun’s words. He was disappointed, “Then there’s nothing I can do about it. But that lass is unlucky. I know those three disciples well, they are from the Demonflame Sect. They’re a bunch of madmen who will do anything.”

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that, but he said nothing.

“Hehe, this bitch isn’t bad.”

“She has a good figure too. Hehe, I bet she must be a virgin!”

“Look at how aloof she is right now. I wonder if she’ll be able to maintain that attitude.” The three checked out Liu Yue’s figure without any reservation. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“You clowns aren’t afraid of death? I’m the beloved daughter of the Divine Guards’ commander. You guys won’t be able to leave the Extermination Barrens if you dare to touch me!” said Liu Yue coldly.

The grey-clothed youth’s face suddenly sank. He took a step forward and threw a palm at Liu Yue. He then snorted, “You think we don’t know about your identity? You must be courting death to try and put on airs in the Demonlotus Realm. I’ll be honest with you. I can spare your life if you’re obedient. Otherwise, we’ll strip you and hang you on this tree. We’ll let everyone admire the naked beloved daughter of the Flying Dragon General!”

“You dare!” Liu Yue’s eyes trembled with fear.

“You think I don’t?” The youth sneered and gave a signal to his buddies. The two instantly understood the signal and sandwiched Liu Yue. This made Liu Yue start to panic. She had been living under her father's halo, so she had never experienced such a situation.

“D-d-don’t come here!” panicked Liu Yue.

But just when she got up, her clothes were ripped off and revealed her skin.

“Hahaha!” The two Demonflame Sect’s disciples laughed when they saw this scene.

“That’s enough!” A figure suddenly appeared before Liu Yue. Lin Yun’s face was cold as he held onto the Flower Burial Sword with a cold light flickering in his eyes.
