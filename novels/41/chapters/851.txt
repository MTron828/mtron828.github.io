Chapter 852 - Bucktooth Is Its Main Form

Lil’ Red awakening was more important to Lin Yun than secrets of the Azure Dragon Ancestor God. After all, he owed Lil’ Red a great debt. He also had no idea how Lil’ Red had turned out. So he started to look around nervously, afraid that Lil’ Red wouldn’t recognize him anymore.

“At the peak.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture turned around and looked at the three flaming peaks.

Lin Yun was familiar with those peaks. After all, he had obtained the Flamedragon Fruit there. The peaks also had countless treasures that were baptised by the Flame Dragon’s blood.

However, it was a forbidden zone with terrifying flame intent. Not even the Indigothunder Dragonvulture dared to step in. If Lin Yun didn’t grasp the spiritual sword intent, he definitely wouldn’t dare to step inside the region. So it was shocking to him that Lil’ Red was there when it had just woken up.

Is it really there? Lin Yun couldn’t believe it. But a long time later, he let out a loud roar. If Lil’ Red was really there, then it would recognize his roar and give a reply. If it didn’t reply, then Lil’ Red must have forgotten all of its past. As he waited, he gradually became even more nervous.

“Don’t worry about it.” The Indigothunder Dragonvulture comforted Lin Yun, but there was something weird about its tone.

A short while later, a roar echoed out from the flaming peak as a reply to Lin Yun. A figure instantly shuttled over. Soon, the newly born Dragon-Blooded Horse appeared in Lin Yun’s vision. It was a demonic beast filled with ferocious aura and a wisp of dragon aura. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

From afar, it still looked like a horse covered with sparkling dragon scales that looked like armor. As it ran over, the ground started to tremble. Amazingly, Lil’ Red could travel through the forbidden zone that was covered in flames.

Its robust figure was filled with power and its horn was even sharper than before. Lil’ Red was a monarch demonic beast with the dragon clan’s bloodline.

Lin Yun was surprised but he could guarantee that this was the same Lil’ Red. It had become a lot stronger than before and even emitted a boundless spiritual energy. Furthermore, it’s aura could easily suppress a Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast even though it was in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm.

Lin Yun could only imagine how Lil’ Red would become after reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm. There was no doubt that it would be even stronger than the Indigothunder Dragonvulture. However, the monarch aura coming from Lil’ Red was unfamiliar to Lin Yun.

The demonic beast shrouded in dragon scales armor appeared before Lin Yun in the blink of an eye. As its boundless aura spread out, Lin Yun’s hair began to flutter in the wind and he had to squint his eyes. Lil’ Red’s aura was really terrifying and Lin Yun would have been sent flying if he hadn’t gotten a lot stronger.

But while Lin Yun was shocked, Lil’ Red grinned and revealed its bucktooth. In that second, the powerful aura disappeared as Lil’ Red started chuckling like a goof.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled. Lil’ Red was now a monarch demonic beast, but its bucktooth was still there. Could it be that its bucktooth was its core?

Just when Lin Yun smiled, Lil’ Red’s stomach began to swell as its robust limbs became skinny. Lil’ Red suddenly flopped on its belly since its limbs could no longer support its weight. Lin Yun froze when he saw this. Why did it turn into a pig all of a sudden? Could it be that this was its true form? Even with Lin Yun’s wide experience, he couldn’t help feeling dumbfounded.

Lil’ Red was still struggling with its skinny limbs as it attempted to salvage its image. All Lin Yun could do was shake his head.

“I’m sorry about that. I didn’t know that it would turn into this state. In half a month, it nearly ate all of the treasures in the three flaming peaks,” said the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

At this moment, Lin Yun finally knew why the Indigothunder Dragonvulture hesitated earlier. If he was in that position, he would also feel awkward.

“After it digested the spiritual energy, it had to fight with many other demonic beasts. Since you didn’t come, I let it have its way,” said the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

“I can’t let it have its way anymore. I have to take it away to train.” Lin Yun felt a headache because he wanted to bring Lil’ Red to the Heavenly Path. If it was this fat, he wouldn’t have the face to bring it out. People might even mistake it for a pig, which would completely ruin his reputation.

When the Indigothunder Dragonvulture saw that Lil’ Red couldn’t get up, it roared and unleashed a terrifying aura. Dragon runes started to squirm all over its body before several bolts of lightning charged at Lil’ Red. When the lightning exploded, Lil’ Red was drowned by bright lights.

“What are you trying to do?” Lin Yun was full of doubt before the lightning dissipated and revealed a red ball on the ground. It looked like a fat squirrel as its sharp horn suddenly became round. Lil’ Red’s new form was adorable and lacked all of its previous prestige.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture began explaining, “This is the bloodline ability your Dragon-blooded Horse obtained after breaking out of the cocoon. It can take two forms, but its not familiar with this one so it needs some help transforming.”

Basically, it needs a beating. Lin Yun said inwardly.

“Strictly speaking, this is its main form. After all, it’s no different from a baby that was just born,” said the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

No, its bucktooth form is the main form. Lin Yun retorted inwardly. Soon after, the Indigothunder Dragonvulture disappeared, leaving Lin Yun on his own. Lin Yun also quickly left because he had no time to waste and needed to go into seclusion.

He had become a lot stronger after the banquet and even obtained a wisp of complete dragon aura. On top of that, he obtained two fortune martial techniques in the Dragoncloud Treasury. With such a large harvest, he had to make use of them well.

“What Lil’ Purple said is right. I can’t use the dragon aura to make a breakthrough because I need to accumulate more strength. At the very least, I can’t be worse than the geniuses of the other realms or else I’ll be another version of Yu Haotian.” Lin Yun wasn’t too obsessed with his cultivation, so he wasn’t desperate to make a breakthrough.

If he wasn’t going to use the dragon aura to make a breakthrough, he could use it to cultivate the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. For a greater fortune martial technique, he needed to use an astronomical amount of resources. Unfortunately, he didn’t have many astral pearls with him anymore.

“My only concern is whether or not the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra will clash with the Iris Sword Sutra. The first three stages are just the foundation. If I focus more on the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra, then it’ll delay my cultivation in the Iris Sword Sutra. Furthermore, the Iris Sword Sutra is already at the pinnacle twelfth stage, so I only have four stages until I reach perfection.” This was Lin Yun’s biggest dilemma because he definitely had to cultivate the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra because he already benefited greatly with just three stages.

Not to mention that it also came with a sword technique. If it wasn’t empowered by the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra, the Azure Firmament Thirteen Swords would be greatly weakened. However, the Iris Sword Sutra wasn’t ordinary either. Although it wasn’t complete, he had cultivated it for so long. If it was devoured by the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra, then he wouldn’t be able to bring out the Iris Sword Array anymore.

“I’m going to do it!” Lin Yun never wavered, so he quickly made his decision. The Azure Firmament Sword Sutra was a greater fortune martial technique. It was at a much higher grade than the Iris Sword Sutra, not to mention that he couldn’t give up on the Azure Firmament Thirteen Sword. As for the Iris Sword Sutra, it wouldn’t be too late for him to pick it up again when he obtained the complete version. Therefore, Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to sit down by the border of the forbidden zone.

“The Azure Firmament Sword Sutra has a total of ten stages. Since the first three stages are the foundation, it definitely won’t be easy to grasp.” Lin Yun looked at the flaming peaks before he slowly closed his eyes.

He calmed himself down and looked at the dazzling brilliance within his body. He felt tiny in comparison to the aura. He would have to continue developing it for the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra.

Not only did he need an astronomical sum of resources, but he also needed high comprehension. If he didn’t have both, he would fail and his meridians would get injured. However, the divine dragon aura would prevent this.

Bursting with confidence, Lin Yun started to circulate the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra as azure origin energy began to fill up his meridians.
