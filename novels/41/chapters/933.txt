Chapter 934 - Fight

The city was silent. How could Lin Yun be so arrogant when the higher realms were so certain he wouldn’t show up?

“Let’s see if you dare to be so arrogant when the Bloodbone Realm arrives!” The higher realms were staring at Lin Yun coldly. As geniuses from the higher realms, they naturally couldn’t accept Lin Yun’s arrogance. It wasn’t behavior befitting an ant.

Suddenly, the Bloodbone Realm arrived on the city wall. Yuan Hengtian shot a venomous look at Lin Yun as he gritted his teeth, “Lin Yun, you really came!”

The other elites from the Bloodbone Realm were also looking at Lin Yun with the same venomous looks. However, Lin Yun ignored the looks and replied, “Didn’t I make the challenge ten days ago? Of course I would show up. So are you the one representing the Bloodbone Realm or is it all of you together? Either way, it doesn’t matter.”

Lin Yun didn’t bother hiding his disdain when he spoke to Yuan Hengtian. If he fought Yuan Hengtian again, he was confident that he wouldn’t need his sword to suppress Yuan Hengtian. He might even be able to take Yuan Hengtian down with just one attack. This was the confidence born from the foundation of 1,500 divine astral pellets.

“Lin Yun, you’re courting death!” Yuan Hengtian lost it when he saw the disdain in Lin Yun’s eyes. With Senior Brother Kong and all the elites here to back him up, he wasn’t afraid. Instantly, he charged at Lin Yun and yelled, “I was careless when we fought. Do you really think you can actually beat me?!”

As a genius on the Azure Dragon Ranking, he was confident in his ability. If he managed to beat Lin Yun, he would be cleansed of his humiliation.

With a cold light flashing through his eyes, Lin Yun counterattacked. Circulating both aura oceans at the same time, he hit Yuan Hengtian square in the chest. Yuan Hengtian instantly collapsed to the ground as his face twisted in pain.

“First soul Heavenly Soul Realm!” Fear filled Yuan Hengtian’s eyes because Lin Yun became insanely strong after just ten days.

With ridicule in his eyes, Lin Yun barked, “Get lost!”

Reaching out with his hand, Lin Yun casually used the back of his hand to shoo Yuan Hengtian away. The powerful wind sent Yuan Hengtian flying like a piece of trash. Everyone was dumbfounded because Yuan Hengtian was on the Azure Dragon Ranking. How could Lin Yun deal with him so easily?

“Is there really no one capable from the Bloodbone Realm?” asked Lin Yun with a bored look. The Bloodbone Realm elites turned pale as they started to sweat. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun wasn’t from the higher realms.

“Who says that the Bloodbone Realm doesn’t have anyone? Lin Yun, your opponent is me, Kong Xuan!” A sudden burst of energy made the entire city tremble. Kong Xuan’s chilling aura also caused the city to go dark.

No one could believe their ears. Kong Xuan was the second strongest in the Bloodbone Realm and 46th on the Azure Dragon Ranking. Was this third soul genius really going to fight Lin Yun?

Kong Xuan soared into the sky and landed on the city wall with a force so strong that the city started to shake.

“It really is Kong Xuan!” All of the geniuses from the higher realms were excited. Kong Xuan was famous throughout the Azure Dragon Region, so it would be a treat to watch him.

At first, everyone thought that the Bloodbone Realm would suffer from Lin Yun once again. However, Kong Xuan was here, so the outcome wouldn’t be the same.

“Senior brother!” The elites from the Bloodbone Realm who were intimidated earlier were able to collect themselves. With Kong Xuan around, this meant that Lin Yun was destined to beg for his life.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Kong Xuan turned to look at Lin Yun coldly, “The Heavenly Path is filled with many opportunities. I’ve seen many people rise and fall in the blink of an eye. True experts are forged through blood and fire, but you’re not one of them!”

Then, Kong Xuan’s eyes flashed as he tried to find the flaw in Lin Yun’s sword aura. “Ever since I, Kong Xuan, arrived at the Heavenly Path, I have fought more than 100 battles and I’m still alive. I’m the reason why the Bloodbone Realm has its reputation. We didn’t just come out of nowhere!”

Lin Yun thought Kong Xuan’s words were idiotic. Kong Xuan made it sound like all of the geniuses in the Heavenly Path hadn’t been forged by blood and fire before. Clearly, the arrogance of the higher realms knew no limit.

Essentially, it was a sin to kill a genius from the higher realm, let alone to look at one. Otherwise, why would they care if the other realms competed with them?

“So what if I’m like a comet that shines bright for just one moment? As long as the comet shines brightly, the moment lasts forever. It’s way better than being a dog from the higher realms like you.” Lin Yun stared straight into the eyes of Kong Xuan without any fear.

To the higher realms, Lin Yun was the epitome of arrogance. As for Kong Xuan, his killing intent had been completely aroused.

If the strongest people on the Azure Dragon Ranking dared to speak to him like this, he wouldn’t dare to utter a single word. But this was just Lin Yun? He had already crushed many first soul Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses, so they were nothing more than ants to him.

“You’re full of it!” Crimson radiance gathered in Kong Xuan’s fist as his origin energy spread out. “You really need to learn how to respect your seniors!”

When Kong Xuan circulated all four of his aura oceans, his boundless origin energy started gushing with him in the center. Just like that, a vortex had appeared.

At the same time, a crimson giant donned in armor came out of the vortex. Kong Xuan’s strength was unbelievable.

“Bloodbone Demon Palm!” With a dark face, Kong Xuan and the crimson giant threw a punch at Lin Yun. The phenomenon was so large that a shadow was cast over the city.

Kong Xuan’s Bloodbone Demon Palm was a lot stronger than Yuan Hengtian’s palm. Lin Yun’s expression became grave when he saw this. He was arrogant, but he never underestimated his opponents. With a flip of his hand, he started pouring origin energy into an ancient seal. Kong Xuan wants to teach me a lesson? Yeah right!
