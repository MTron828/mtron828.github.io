Chapter 2139: Who Are You?!

The battle on the Indigo Dragon Path attracted everyone’s attention, and this made the other Dragon Mountains pale in comparison. When everyone saw this scene, they could only describe Lin Yun’s performance as beautiful. There wasn’t much to describe about the elegance and agility of Lin Yun’s sword techniques, not to mention that they couldn’t be tracked. But everyone could tell that it was the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword.

The Divine Firefly Sword was a famous sword technique within the Kunlun Realm, and every holy land had a copy of it. But not many people could reach Lin Yun’s height. Or rather, he might be the only one who had achieved such levels.

“Ye Qingtian is showing the potential of a young Sword Emperor!”

"Ye Qingtian's arrogance is well-founded. Compared to him, the other geniuses on the Indigo Dragon Road are indeed trash."

“Look, Mu Qianjue is about to take action!" Just when everyone was shocked by Lin Yun's sword technique, Mu Qianjue, the Champion of the Fourth Heavenly Path, finally made his move.

“Selfless and formless!” Mu Qianjue appeared above the silver sword domain with a flash, releasing an unimaginable saint aura. As saint aura gathered in his right hand, there were two greater daos coiling around his arm, the Ice and Wind Daos. In the next moment, he struck down, releasing a gigantic palm.

“Two greater daos!”

“Not only that! There are ten-odd lesser daos behind him!”

“The martial technique he’s using is called the Phaseless Divine Seal. Does that mean that Mu Qianjue has practiced the dragon spirit martial technique, the Great Divine Phaseless Art?” Mu Qianjue’s attack had shocked everyone.

Martial techniques were classified into four grades, holy spirit, ghost spirit, dragon spirit, and the legendary divine spirit martial techniques. Divine spirit martial techniques were already the best, while dragon spirit martial techniques were extremely destructive, capable of destroying mountains and rivers.

Dragon spirit martial techniques could only be practiced by cultivators who stepped on the saint path. It wasn’t something a Quasi-Saint could practice, and most people could only practice the prerequisite technique for the dragon spirit martial technique. For example, the Great Profound Sword Canon was a dragon spirit martial technique, but one couldn’t immediately practice it but had to bring the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to the pinnacle complete mastery before they could start practicing it.

To Quasi-Saints, most people would choose high-grade dragon spirit martial techniques or secret techniques comparable to dragon spirit martial techniques.Evidently, the Great Divine Phaseless Art executed by Mu Qianjue was an actual dragon spirit martial technique.

When the palm descended, Lin Yun’s silver ‘sword domain’ began to crumble along with his sword aura. It was because the silver ‘sword domain’ was ultimately not the actual sword domain. So there was no way it could compete with absolute power, and the shattered silver domain exploded in the form of a sword aura.

As the strong wind blew and Lin Yun’s hair began to flutter, he took two steps back and recalled his sword. When he held onto the sword, he held the sword in a back grip with the sword leaning against his arm. Meanwhile, he pressed his thumb down on his middle finger, preparing the Iris Saint Seal.

When an Iris flower bloomed on the back of his hand, Lin Yun executed the Flicking Divine Finger?and over a hundred galaxies and his dual sword stars fused into this attack. Simultaneously, sunlight and moonlight shone from his hand as Lin Yun pushed his right hand forth along with a massie sword aura.

In the next second, he unleashed a hundred-foot sword ray. When the two powers clashed, a terrifying explosion echoed on the Dragon Mountain, where the sword aura and phenomena exploded in mid-air, forming into a five-colored mist that made the Dragon’s Head tremble.

This scene immediately made everyone wonder if Ye Qingtian was about to lose. When they raised their heads, they could only see the entire Dragon’s Head being enveloped in a boundless saint aura, preventing them from looking at the outcome.

After all, the weight of the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking was heavier than the fame of a swordsman prodigy. Not to mention Mu Qianjue had grasped two greater daos and practiced a dragon spirit martial technique. No matter how they looked at it, Ye Qingtian should be defeated, and would be reduced to a cripple.

But all of a sudden, a sword ray pierced through the mist that created a hole on the huge palm. The sword ray didn’t stop there but continued to head towards Mu Qianjue.

Lin Yun was enveloped in a faint mist as he stood upright like a sword.

Looking at the incoming attack, Mu Qianjue roared, and pushed his palm forth to resolve the incoming sword ray. The Great Divine Phaseless Art was a dragon spirit martial technique, not to mention it was further empowered by two greater daos. So it naturally wouldn’t be easily resolved by Astral Sword Intent.

After shattering the sword ray, Mu Qianjue hovered in the air and pushed his palm forth again. An eye opened on his palm, shrouded by two greater daos and ten-odd lesser daos. The moment the eye opened up, the saint daos manifested into various beasts that charged at Lin Yun, wanting to suppress him.

There was a massive Dracoserpent, a sinister-looking Demonic Arachnid, a silver White-Eyed Demonwolf, and a Heavenly Roc. Various demonic beasts flew out from the eye, and the aura given off by each beast reached the Quasi-Saint Realm, looking realistic.

They were all the saint blood and souls that Mu Qianjue had refined in the past. It was naturally impossible to control them through other martial techniques, but the Great Divine Phaseless Art was different. Not only could it control them perfectly, but he could even combine them perfectly.

“This is the Phaseless Evil Eye. If you can take this attack and live, only then are you qualified to be my opponent.” Mu Qianjue had no expression on his face as he became enveloped in saint aura. His Quasi-Saint’s aura was like a screen that enveloped the sky, and others couldn’t even see his actual appearance because of it.

But Mu Qianjue inwardly sighed because he knew that it was practically impossible to crush Ye Qingtian since he failed to suppress him with his attack earlier.

Facing the incoming attacks, Lin Yun executed the Divine Firefly Sword. The profundity contained within his attack had far surpassed Yu Qingfeng’s, containing his own comprehension of this sword technique. After coming this far, one could no longer look at the shadows of Yu Qingfeng in Lin Yun’s Divine Firefly Sword.

As Lin Yun performed the Divine Firefly Sword, a surging river appeared within a ten-mile radius around Lin Yun that looked like a dragon coiling around him. The sky alternated between light and dark as multiple sword auras flew at those demonic beasts that were empowered with saint daos.

“As expected of a swordsman prodigy! He has reached the deification stage with the Divine Firefly Sword!”

“I noticed that the profundity in his sword technique seems to be related to the Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng earlier, but I can’t see through the profundity of his attack now.”

“He’s strong, but even someone strong can’t fight endlessly without rest, and he will reveal his flaw sooner or later.”

“He didn’t rest ever since he arrived on the Indigo Dragon Path. The moment he reveals his flaw, he will be defeated while facing an expert with a higher cultivation than him.”

There were many discussions from the surroundings. For a swordsman to come this far, they would either defeat their opponent with one blow or be defeated.

Several holy sons who have gathered on the Dragon’s Claws were watching this battle. They were naturally unhappy with Ye Qingtian. Or rather, no one on the Indigo Dragon Path were happy with Ye Qingtian, which was pretty obvious when everyone echoed along, demanding Ye Qingtian to get off of the Indigo Dragon Path.

Suddenly, a gaze fell onto An Liuyan, and he smiled, “I’m afraid that there won’t be an outcome in the fight between Ye Qingtian and Mu Qianjue anytime soon. So…”

This person was the holy son of the Heavenly Star Palace, and he was only second to Mu Qianjue in the eyes of everyone.

Beside him stood a tall and skinny youth who smiled, “If we can capture An Liuyan, we can use her to hold down Ye Qingtian. The moment a swordsman panics, he will show his flaw.”

This person was the holy son of the Southern Border’s Ancient Moon Sect, and his strength wasn’t at all inferior to the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son. His words immediately made the eyes of everyone on the Indigo Dragon Path to light up.

They wouldn’t have stooped so low in the past, but Ye Qingtian had become their nightmare on the Indigo Dragon Path. If Ye Qingtian wasn’t defeated, they wouldn’t be able to stand out in the future, and they would become Ye Qingtian’s stepping stone for eternity.

“We naturally don’t have to speak about righteousness with a demoness. Let’s just make a move!” The Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son made a move and charged at An Liuyan.

An Liuyan was nervously watching Lin Yun’s battle. The moment she sensed the danger, she immediately activated the White Dragon Bone with a silver fan appearing in her hand, unleashing streams of energies through the fan at the assailant.

The Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son reached out with a vortex appearing in his palm that devoured all the incoming energies. He was only a hundred meters away from An Liuyan, and he greedily looked at An Liuyan. He grinned, “Lady An does have a superb figure, so it is no wonder why Ye Qingtian is so fascinated by you. But it’s a pity that you’re a little too weak.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He was confident in his own strength. He might not be able to defeat Ye Qingtian, but a mere demoness was nothing to him.

“I advise you not to touch her!” Right then, a young swordsman ran all the way up from the bottom of the Indigo Dragon Path. This person was swift, and the sword intent he gave off left the geniuses on the Dragon's Claw shocked.

This was an unfamiliar youth to everyone. He donned a white robe with a crimson bracelet on his wrist as he ran up the mountain.

“Who the hell do you think you are? Get lost!” When someone saw the youth running past them, they soared to the sky and charged at the youth. There were a total of three of them, and they were geniuses on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking that charged at the youth from different directions.

Those on the Indigo Dragon Path didn’t welcome Ye Qingtian because they didn’t want to see a demoness ranked ahead of them. The Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son might be despicable, but everyone was inwardly cheering for him, hoping that Ye Qingtian would be distracted and die in the hands of Mu Qianjue.

“Such impudence!” The swordsman drew his sword and swung it, striking one of the three, resolving that person’s saint aura and leaving him heavily injured while flying off of the Indigo Dragon Path. This left the remaining two who were charging over dumbfounded because they didn’t expect this swordsman to be so powerful.

But the two soon calmed themselves down and charged at the swordsman with all their strength. But the white-clothed swordsman shook his wrist, unleashing a sword ray that looked like a dragon that knocked the two people who were charging over flying away.

The two were covered in blood and were screaming while rolling on the ground after they landed.

“What a powerful sword technique!”

“Another genius, but who the hell is he? Why did he appear out of nowhere?”

“Is he Ye Qingtian’s friend or is he An Liuyan’s helper?” Many people were surprised by the appearance of this swordsman, and they looked at the crimson bracelet on his wrist, falling into deep thoughts.

With a few flickers, the white-clothed swordsman arrived beside An Liuyan, coldly looking at the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son. This instantly made the Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son nervous because he could sense a threat coming from this swordsman. He had a powerful baleful aura that showed that this person had slaughtered his way through a mountain of corpses.

“Who are you?” The Heavenly Star Palace’s holy son frowned. He asked, “Why are you helping this demoness?”

“Blood Word Battalion, Bai Lixuan. But I prefer others to call me White!” The youth snorted, and his revelation caused an uproar outside the Dragon Mountains.
