Chapter 2072: Radiant’s Lineage Never Lowers Our Heads!

“There’s no limit to dao?” Lin Yun fell into deep thought but didn’t quite understand that sentence. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Lil’ Purple explained, “It means that there’s no limit to the weakest dao, and you can even use the weakest dao to defeat the strongest.”

Lin Yun roughly understood what she meant now, and there’s no limit to dao. Weaker daos might have a lower start, but there’s no limit to how far you can go.

.

“There are nine eternal daos, thirty-six sovereign daos, three thousand great daos, eight hundred thousand side daos, and countless lesser daos. The Azure Origin Phase focuses on refining saint aura; the Indigo Origin Phase mainly focuses on comprehending saint dao; Heavenly Origin Phase focuses on infusing saint dao into your sacred flame. You can also pick a saint dao to focus on and focus other saint daos into it. The more saint daos you can grasp, the more powerful your sacred flame will become,” Lil’ Purple explained. “Take the flowers behind you, for example. They’re all lesser daos, so don’t use them as your main dao. Although your cultivation will rise rapidly that way, it’ll be tough for you to go any further in the Saint Realm in the future.”

Lin Yun finally understood what Lil’ Purple meant now. He asked, “How can you cultivate the eternal and sovereign daos?”

In Lin Yun’s view, he naturally had to firmly grasp the Nirvana Dao since it’s one of the nine eternal daos. Lil’ Purple calmly replied, “Patience and opportunities. If it’s the lesser daos, it shouldn’t be a problem for you. Each dao is profound, and it’s difficult for a talented genius to grasp a great dao or side dao. The thirty-six sovereign daos are on another level, requiring both talent and comprehension. Take sword dao, for example. That’s one of the thirty-six sovereign daos, and someone at the Heavenly Origin Phase might not be able to grasp it even if they used a century.”

As one of the thirty-six sovereign daos, sword dao could naturally be infused into the sacred flame and reach the Saint Realm. But any great dao or sovereign dao required lesser daos to perfect and strengthen it. Then again, some geniuses used sovereign daos to assist side daos. Some could even fuse various sovereign daos together, but those were rare geniuses, even in the Golden Era.

Lin Yun listened and finally had a rough idea about it. He said, “I’ve heard from the Iris Sword Saint that fate dao is the strongest amongst the nine eternal daos, and even nirvana dao couldn’t be compared to it.”

“Fate dao is too mysterious, and I’ve only heard legends about it in my era,” Lil’ Purple nodded with a grave expression. “A portion of my memories are missing, and I’m not sure what fate dao means. Aside from karma dao that can barely compete with fate dao, it’s hard for other eternal daos to compete.”

Hearing what Lil’ Purple said, Lin Yun asked, “Is karma dao really that powerful?”

“It’s too far away from you. If you can master the Sword of the Beginning, there’s a high chance you can grasp nirvana dao. The mystery of nirvana dao is enough for you to stand out within the Kunlun Realm, but it won’t be an easy path.”

“I’ll follow my own path,” Lin Yun said.

Lil’ Purple gratifiedly nodded, “You have one day left, so you should rest well. This battle is important, and you must keep your spirits up.”

“Okay,” Lin Yun said as he handed a box to Lil’ Purple.

“What is this?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Open it,” Lin Yun smiled.

“The Samsara Nirvana Pellet!” Lil’ Purple’s eyes shone brightly as she joyfully looked at Lin Yun. This was the Samsara Nirvana Pellet that the Iris Sword Saint had refined for Lin Yun to face his tribulation.

“You can safely keep it for me,” Lin Yun said.

Lil’ Purple stowed the pellet and smiled, “Since it’s in my hands, you can dream about me returning it!”

Lin Yun smiled because Lil’ Purple was throwing a tantrum after they came out of the God Burial Mountain Range and only talked to him after the Sword Assembly began. But even if she threw a tantrum, she wouldn’t stand by when Lin Yun faced trouble. Like Lil’ Purple said, she had a small heart and couldn’t contain too many people. But the moment someone entered her heart, she wouldn’t hesitate to put her life in danger when needed.

Lin Yun looked at the empress’ smile, and his facial expression became gentle.

Within the Mountain River Order, Feng Shaoyu stayed in it for a year, but two days had passed in the outside world. Feng Shaoyu was already at the pinnacle of the Azure Origin Phase, but he finally stepped forward and became stronger.

The core of the Mountain River Order was covered in mist and flowers, which made this place look like a celestial realm. There was a stone monument before Feng Shaoyu, and there was an old man seated on the monument.

The old man had a white beard and hair shrouded in dazzling radiance that looked as though he had a sun within his body. This person was the old manor master, the Abyssal Gale Great Saint. He was also the one who forged the Heavenly Dipper Sword.

The Abyssal Gale Great Saint smiled, “You can leave now that you’ve made a breakthrough. There’s not much meaning for you to stay any longer.”

“Okay.” Feng Shaoyu opened his eyes that shone brightly.

“The Mountain River Order is a time-space treasure, and the resources to activate it are unimaginable. Remember, you’re only allowed to win,” the Abyssal Gale Great Saint said. “Even if the Sword Alliance is weak, we can’t allow the Heavenly Dao Sect to ride on our heads.”

“I won’t let you down in this battle,” Feng Shaoyu cupped his fists together. He turned around and left with his eyes radiating with confidence and a smile on his lips. Before entering the Mountain River Order, he wasn’t afraid of Ye Qingtian and had high confidence in defeating him. Now that he spent a year within the Mountain River Order, he no longer placed Ye Qingtian in his eyes, even if what Gu Zijing said was true.

He could easily crush Ye Qingtian to death if he wanted to. But he wasn’t too concerned with the outcome since he would win either way. He wanted Ye Qingtian to feel despair!

“Come out,” the Abyssal Gale Great Saint coldly said after Feng Shaoyu left.

Feng Yu came out from behind a boulder and looked at the Abyssal Gale Great Saint with a smile. She mocked, “It’s been so long since I last returned, but it looks like the Hidden Sword Manor has declined to resort to using such a cheating method just to prevent anyone from taking the Cauldron Sword.”

“You still have the face to return? You’re my beloved daughter with the highest chance of reaching the Emperor Realm. But you hurt me the deepest!” The Abyssal Gale Great Saint said coldly. He couldn’t maintain his composure as he talked about this.

“You still have the face to mention that? You’re my father but you don’t understand me better than my master. I don’t like him, but you wanted me to marry him. Do you know how much pain I was in?!” Feng Yu gritted.

As a cold light flashed within the Abyssal Gale Great Saint’s eyes, murderous intent flashed within his pupils. He coldly said, “Don’t mention him! Do you remember how much effort I’ve spent to matchmake you? He embarrassed me by bringing you away, and I wish I could crush him to death!

“You’re here to beg the sword for him, right?” The Abyssal Gale Great Saint sneered, “After Firmament was borrowed, I guessed someone would try to help him borrow the Cauldron Sword. Let me tell you this, dream on!

“People might fear him if it was a century ago, but he’s no different from a dead person now. Who will put him in their eyes? Don’t even dream about it!”

Seeing this, Feng Yu hatefully said, “I bet no one told you that the Heavenly Dipper Sword you forged has broken, right?”

“How is that possible?” The Abyssal Gale Great Saint was stunned.

“Everyone in the Southern Border knows about it by now, and the one who broke the Heavenly Dipper Sword was only at the Nirvana Stage. He’s also the one who wants to borrow the Cauldron Sword,” Feng Yu said.

“H-How is this possible?!” Feng Yu was stumped. The Heavenly Dipper Sword was his prized work for the Sword Assembly’s champion. He wanted to use this opportunity to boost the Hidden Sword Manor’s reputation even further, and let the owner of the Heavenly Dipper Sword’s reputation spread throughout the Kunlun Realm. So he couldn’t believe that someone had broken it.

“How can someone with a cultivation at the Nirvana Stage break it?” The Abyssal Gale Great Saint frowned, unwilling to believe it. But he knew Feng Yu wouldn’t lie to him, even if she had a foul temper.

“It’s no wonder why Wuji got Yu’er to come to the Mountain River Order,” the Abyssal Gale Great Saint said with a hint of vexation flashing across his face. “Muddle-headed, muddle-headed!”

The Abyssal Gale Great Saint sighed, “So what if we let such a genius borrow the Cauldron Sword? What is Wuji thinking?”

As a Sovereign Saint Sword, it was naturally best for the Cauldron Sword to stay within the Hidden Sword Manor. But if someone could snap the Heavenly Dipper Sword while being at the Nirvana Stage, the Abyssal Gale Great Saint would be fine letting such a genius borrow the sword.

The Golden Era was arriving, and such a genius would rise to the sky. Letting such a genius borrow the sword was a huge opportunity for them to form a connection with such a genius, and this was why the Abyssal Gale Great Saint was vexed.

Feng Yu said, “You don’t have to be vexed about it. Oh, I forgot to mention that he’s my junior brother, our master’s most beloved disciple. You’ll probably anger yourself to death if you learn the truth after lending it to him.”

Her main objective was to tell him about the snapped sword. Maybe the old man would change his mind and let the Cauldron Sword be borrowed after hearing that. But after hearing how the old man insulted her master, Feng Yu was also curious and didn’t want to waste saliva with him.

The Abyssal Gale Great Saint’s face became splendor, and the vexed expression earlier turned into shock and rage. But he soon calmed down. It turned out that the genius he admired for so long was a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, and he was the clown throughout the entire process.

The Abyssal Gale Great Saint looked at the cunning light within Feng Yu’s eyes and instantly knew she had done this on purpose. Feng Yu might anger him, but he had to admit Feng Yu understood him the best. Even Feng Wuji wouldn’t understand him better than Feng Yu.

A long time later, the Abyssal Gale Great Saint sighed, “You know that I cherish geniuses the most in my life. So why did you still tell me about him? If you say some nice words, I might have lent him the Cauldron Sword even if he loses.”

Feng Yu pridefully stood up like a sword and gritted her teeth, “That was what I was thinking at first, but I changed my mind. My master can make it through this tribulation, and the Sword Sect?will?return to being a holy land one day. You’ll understand tomorrow that you must lend the sword even if you’re unwilling. The Radiant’s lineage will never lower our heads!”

Feng Yu left after saying that.

This made the Abyssal Gale Great Saint furious as his body trembled. A long time later, he furiously destroyed the stone monument and roared, “Radiant! You’re too much!”
