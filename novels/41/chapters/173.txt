Chapter 174 - Laughingstock

L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s branch was usually closed throughout the year. It would only be opened once a year during recruitment. There wouldn’t be any official examinations today. The schedule today was mainly about recruiting and testing.

Xin Yan led everyone through the side gate. When they entered, the long queue was endless. Talents from all over the Great Qin Empire had gathered here.

“So many people…”

“Looks like the Sword Firmament Pavilion is rather popular.”

“I’m afraid that there are over ten thousand people here… Not to mention that the registration has been going on for days…”

Everyone was shocked by the scene before them. But Lin Yun wasn’t too surprised. It was a harsh requirement that only those who’d reached the fourth orifice of the Xiantian Realm before the age of seventeen could join the sect.

But the Great Qin Empire had over a hundred counties. So it wasn’t surprising that there were so many people here. No one knew how long the long queue would take, but everyone was quietly waiting for their turn. When they saw Lin Yun’s group walking in, their eyes turned red with envy.

“Who are they? Why are they exempted from queuing?”

“They must be the seeded candidates. The Sword Firmament Pavilion has seeded candidates every year. The pavilion will send out disciples to scout for talents before the examination.”

“So, what’s so special about them?”

“Nothing much. The only advantage that they have is probably the fact that they can get acquainted with people from the Sword Firmament Pavilion beforehand. As you guys know, it’s beneficial to find someone to support you before entering the pavilion.”

“What if you offend them?”

“Then you’re out of luck. When you enter the pavilion, you’ll be in charge of chopping firewood, picking water, and splashing fertilizers. There are all sorts of ways to mess with you.”

When the youths following Xin Yan heard those words, their eyes radiated with pride. Looking at them, Xin Yan smiled, “Don’t get cocky. Being a seeded candidate doesn’t guarantee you entrance into the Sword Firmament Pavilion. It just means less hassle.”

“Hehe. Don’t worry about it, Big Sister Xin Yan. I will surely not embarrass you. I’m determined to join the Sword Firmament Pavilion.” Li Wuyou spoke out. His words made Xin Yan chuckle.

These youths were carefully selected by her in the North Barren Land. So she would be embarrassed if they couldn’t make it into the pavilion. Although she didn’t seem too worried, she was actually nervous about it.

“Why are you coming to the Sword Firmament Pavilion if you can’t even hold your sword firmly?! I don’t care about your talent. Withstand an attack from me. The Sword Firmament Pavilion doesn’t need trash who can’t even hold their sword firmly. Get the hell out of here! Don’t embarrass the Sword Firmament Pavilion.” A roar rang out.

“Next!”

“How the hell did you cultivate? Why is your spiritual energy so dispersed? You must be cultivating an unorthodox method. You have no future with such an unstable foundation. Get lost.”

“Next!”

“Your aptitude is a little too shitty. Second Grade Spiritual Physique? Next!”

“Your aptitude isn’t bad, but your Martial Soul isn’t suitable to be a swordsman. You should register somewhere else. Don’t waste your future in the Sword Firmament Pavilion.”

“Not bad. You remained standing after bearing my sword aura. Hehe. Come back three days from now.”

A middle-aged man stood before the palace with a wooden sword in his hand. He was in charge of conducting the test. Even Lin Yun was startled when he heard the harsh requirement.

Even someone with a Second Grade Spiritual Physique was eliminated? Lin Yun fell into deep thought. He knew that his aptitude test wouldn’t be good. The reason why he made it into the Xiantian Realm was all thanks to the Seventh Orifice Exquisite Pellet that Su Ziyao gave him.

His aptitude should be at the top of Mortal Physique at best. But he believed that things would work out one way or another. If he couldn’t even get through the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s standards, he wouldn’t make it into the Heavenly Profound Sect either.

If that were the case, the Heavenly Qin Institute would be his only choice. The Heavenly Qin Institute did not have any requirements for background and talent. He could make it in as long as he passed the test.

“Elder Luo Feng, these are the seeded candidates I picked from the North Barren Land. Please take a look at them.” Xin Yan came over with six youths.

There was a black-haired man seated at the top. He wore a purple robe, emitting sword aura from every inch of his body. He gave off a deep and unfathomable feeling.

There were also some Elders of the Sword Firmament Pavilion around him. Every single one of them was emitting a terrifying aura. Luo Feng directed his gaze over when he heard Xin Yan’s words. His gaze made everyone feel as though a long sword pierced through them.

His gaze first fell onto Li Wuyou and he nodded his head, “This lad isn’t bad… Mhm? What powerful incomplete sword intent. It seems to be on the verge of completion.” Luo Feng then suddenly turned to look at Lin Yun.

“Elder Luo Feng, this is Lin Yun. Not only does he have a high comprehension of sword dao, but he also practiced the Thunderblitz Battle Physique.” Xin Yan smiled.

Luo Feng looked at the other Elders and asked, “What do you guys think?”

“Not bad. They’re all worthy of being seeded candidates.”

“Xin Yan’s eyesight isn’t half bad.”

Another group suddenly came over. The man leading the group seemed extraordinary. He was emitting sword aura from his pores that made him seem deep and unfathomable. He was another cultivator in the Profound Martial Realm!

Lin Yun was inwardly startled by this scene. Profound Martial Realms were so common in the four prominent sects.

When Xin Yan saw this group, her face changed slightly. But she still greeted them, “Senior Brother Wang Yan.”

“Haha. Are these the seeded candidates Junior Sister Xin Yan found? What a random bunch. There isn’t a single Profound Martial Realm among them. You should’ve given the quota to the clan elites. Why bother wasting them on these people?” Wang Yan embarrassed Xin Yan without holding back. He criticized Lin Yun’s group to the point of being worthless.

Lin Yun looked at the youths behind Wang Yan. There were six to seven of them and their lowest cultivation was in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm. There was even one among them that had reached the Profound Martial Realm.

But Lin Yun wouldn’t be shocked if that was all. He was more shocked when he saw the youth standing beside Wang Yan. It was Wang Ning of the Wang Clan, who had a deep grudge with him. Their enmity started back in the Azure Sky Sect and grew deeper in the Azure Sun Realm.

He never expected that he would first encounter Wang Ning in the capital before meeting Bai Lixuan. It had been two months since they met and Wang Ning’s cultivation had undergone great improvements.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he bumped gazes with Wang Ning. When he saw this, he couldn’t help but smile bitterly in his heart.

When Wang Ning saw Lin Yun, he was shocked. It was as if he had seen a ghost. He even suspected that his eyes were messing with him. He wanted to slaughter Lin Yun back in the Azure Sky Sect, so he naturally recognized Lin Yun.

“Sword Slave, you’re not dead?” Wang Ning sneered. In his view, Lin Yun was simply courting death to come to the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

At the same time, Wang Ning’s voice left everyone in shock.

“What’s going on?” Wang Yan knitted his brows. Wang Ning had no right to speak in this place. So speaking rashly would be a violation of ranking.

“Big Brother, he's Lin Yun. He’s the one who injured Uncle Bo back in the Azure Sun Realm. But this fellow is just a piece of trash. Back in the Azure Sky Sect, he was famed for his terrible aptitude. So how can someone like him be a seeded candidate?” Wang Ning immediately explained.

“Lin Yun?” Wang Yan suddenly recalled something. The corner of his lips raised, “Are you sure that his aptitude is terrible?”

“I’m absolutely sure about that. Even the Azure Sky Sect didn’t want him. He only remained after going as far as becoming a Sword Slave for two years.”

Listening to that, Wang Yan smiled, “Junior Sister Xin Yan, why did you pick your seeded candidates randomly? We nearly became a laughingstock because of it.”

Wang Yan and Wang Ning’s conversation immediately caused an uproar.

“Sword Slave?”

“How can a Sword Slave become a seeded candidate? Are you saying that we’re not even comparable to a Sword Slave?”

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion is too much!”

“I’ve never heard someone so ridiculous among the four prominent sects!”

They were clearly unhappy by the fact that Lin Yun became a seeded candidate.
