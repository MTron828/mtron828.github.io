Chapter 208 - I'm Wrong

At this moment, in the Pellet Hall, inside of an elegant room were several exquisite spiritual fruits on a table. A refreshing scent from an incense burner circulated through the room. A man named Hu Xingyang was sitting opposite of Liu Yue. He poured a cup of tea and handed it to her as he eagerly smiled, “This is the new spiritual tea developed by the Pellet Hall. Please give it a try, Deacon Liu.”

Liu Yue gracefully picked up the tea and took a sip. However, her mind was clearly not on the tea. Placing the tea down, Liu Yue asked, “How’s that guy doing? It has already been three days, so why hasn’t there been any commotion?”

Hu Xingyang naturally knew who she was talking about and smiled, “Don’t worry about it. Master Ku Yun is anxious to make a breakthrough, so his temper has recently become irritable. No one can stand his temper now, let alone that brat.”

Lin Yun dared to kill Wang Ning back in the Nine Stars Contest, so how could he bear Ku Yun’s temper?

“You didn’t see how ugly his face became, he even wanted to run away.” Hu Xingyang said leisurely while placing the cup of tea down.

Raising her brow, Liu Yue asked, “What happened later?”

“How could he run away with me around? I eventually pushed him in. Now, there’s no way he can get out of this pit even if he wanted to,” Hu Xingyang smiled indifferently.

“Good. As long as he dares to escape, we can capture him as a herb slave,” Liu Yue replied coldly.

Shaking the teacup in his hand, Hu Xingyang whispered, “Don’t worry about it. The Pellet Hall isn’t like any other place. Even if Xin Yan were to come, she would have no power. No one can interfere in this matter unless a Sword-Bearing Elder comes.”

“I’m not in a hurry. Treat Xin Yan well if she comes. I’ll wait for her to beg me!” Liu Yue replied indifferently. Liu Yue recalled how gallant Xin Yan looked when she swung her sword, causing her to hate Xin Yan even more than Lin Yun, the one who whipped her three times.

All of a sudden, a muffled explosion rang out. The tremor even caused the teacup on the table to shake.

A cold light flashed across Hu Xingyang’s eyes and he smiled, “Speak of the devil. It should be from Master Ku Yun’s Alchemy Chamber.”

“You know what to do now.” Liu Yue nodded.

“Don’t worry about it. I’ll get someone to watch over that brat. If that brat dares to run, I’ll have him captured immediately. He won’t be able to run as long as he’s in the Pellet Hall!”

After the explosion, Ku Yun’s Alchemy Chamber was a complete mess. Even though Lin Yun had hidden, he was still shocked by the aftermath. In this explosion, Ku Yun suffered the worst since his hair was burnt.

Ku Yun muttering to himself, looking at the dim Firecloud Pellet in his hand with disappointment written on his face, “I failed again… This path is really difficult. You stay here for a while. I’ll return immediately.”

“Where are you going?” asked Lin Yun.

“I have to apply for a new batch of materials,” responded Ku Yun.

Ku Yun placed the refined Firecloud Pellet on the table and hurried out of the Alchemy Chamber. With that, Lin Yun was the only one left in the chamber.

He took a short break before he walked over to the table and took a look at the Firecloud Pellet. It was just as he’d expected, the spiritual runes failed to brand themselves onto the pellet. The Firecloud Pellet would be worthless without the spiritual runes.

Placing the Firecloud Pellet down on the table, Lin Yun smiled. Ku Yun was practically refining the Firecloud Pellet with a gambler’s mentality. The Firecloud Spiritual Rune wasn’t stable, so of course it failed when he forced them together. In a nutshell, Ku Yun couldn’t inscribe such a complicated one star spiritual rune with his current level.

Lin Yun’s gaze then fell onto the brush and ink on the table. He only hesitated briefly before he took the brush and a white piece of paper. Circulating the origin energy within his body, he infused a strand of origin energy into the brush.

“This artifact is pretty useful. At least it’s more convenient than using my hand,” said Lin Yun, holding onto the Spiritual Rune Brush. With his level, he couldn’t inscribe in the air itself. That was also why he had such huge exhaustion when inscribing a few spiritual runes back then.

After Lin Yun got familiar with the Spiritual Rune Brush, he circulated his Violet Sacred Flame and focused it on the brush’s tip.

A serious look appeared on his face. Relying on the picture from his memory, he started to inscribe the Firecloud Spiritual Rune. Elementary spiritual runes started to take shape elegantly on the tip of the brush. Compared to Ku Yun, the elementary spiritual runes drawn by him were more perfect.

The elementary spiritual runes were beautiful and elegant in Lin Yun’s hands, inscribed by powerful strokes. Furthermore, the elementary spiritual runes were filled with spiritual energy. Lin Yun had infused the age energy into them.

At this moment, not even the tattered apprentice uniform could cover Lin Yun’s temperament. As Lin Yun’s wrist moved, elementary spiritual runes began to take form.

With a smile on his face, Lin Yun picked up the Firecloud Pellet. When he completed the finishing touches, the elementary spiritual runes instantly came to life. They started to take form and converged into the Firecloud Spiritual Rune before imprinting on the Firecloud Pellet.

In this process, the white paper was ignited and the Firecloud Pellet was reborn. The surface of the pellet was glistering from the Firecloud Spiritual Rune that was imprinted on it.

“It doesn’t seem difficult at all.” Lin Yun placed the Firecloud Pellet down and repeated the process. As he was inscribing the spiritual runes, he could feel that he had entered a mysterious state.

Compared to the last time where he was basically struggling, he was more relaxed and enthusiastic this time around. It didn’t take long for him to finish inscribing the third Firecloud Spiritual Rune.

Suddenly, Lin Yun fell into deep thought. According to the Age Sutra, there were two other spiritual runes that went well with the Firecloud Pellet. If he were to inscribe the three spiritual runes on a Firecloud Pellet…

Lin Yun became excited at the thought of it and started inscribing them. Halfway through the inscribing, Lin Yun could hear footsteps coming from the rear. When Ku Yun saw what Lin Yun was doing, his face changed drastically and he roared, “You bastard! Why did you touch my brush?!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

His roar caught the concentrated Lin Yun by surprise. When Lin Yun’s rhythm was disrupted, the Violet Sacred Flame gathered at the brush’s tip suddenly ignited and incinerated the entire brush.

Lin Yun turned to look at Ku Yun and then looked at the ashes in his hand. An awkward expression filled Lin Yun’s face.

“My Spiritual Rune Brush!” Ku Yun’s eyes instantly turned bloodshot. He rushed over and pushed Lin Yun away. Looking at the ashes left behind by the brush, Ku Yun’s eyes started to turn watery. “This is something that was left behind by my father and I promised him that I would become a two star spiritualist with it… You bastard! Don’t you know that you can’t touch someone else’s brush without permission? Will you let someone touch your sword?!”

Lin Yun started to panic when he heard that. He knew that he had committed a taboo and quickly tried to explain himself, “Master, I’m really sorry about that…”

“Get lost! You bastard, and here I wanted you to inherit my mantle. It has only been three days, but you’ve already gotten so full of yourself!” Ku Yun’s face turned cold as his body trembled. Pointing at Lin Yun, he continued, “Get lost! If it weren’t for the fact that you’ve done a good job here, I would’ve degraded you to a herb slave!”

As an alchemist master in the Pellet Hall, Ku Yun did have the authority to degrade someone as a herbal slave.

Lin Yun was disappointed by Ku Yun’s words. Although he looked down on Ku Yun, the latter still taught him many things over the last three days. Without Ku Yun, he would still have no knowledge about alchemy. But Lin Yun was ashamed because he destroyed someone’s Spiritual Rune Brush.

He knew Ku Yun well. This was the equivalent of someone destroying his FLower Burial Sword. If this happened to Lin Yun, he wouldn’t kill the culprit. Therefore, Lin Yun hoped that Ku Yun would give him some sort of punishment.

“Get lost! Disappear from my sight!” Ku Yun pointed at Lin Yun furiously.

Lin Yun still wanted to speak. He tried to tell Ku Yun that he had successfully imprinted several Firecloud Pellets. But facing Ku Yun’s roar, Lin Yun could only give up.

“I’m sorry, Master.” Lin Yun gave a deep bow before leaving.

Ku Yun gradually calmed down after Lin Yun left, but his expression was still somewhat bleak. When his father passed the brush to him before he died, he had sworn to his father that he would become a two star spiritualist with it. But now, that dream had gone down the drain.

“Father, I’m sorry to let you down. This path is too difficult for me.” Thinking of how he blew up his cauldron four times this month and even became the laughing stock of the Pellet Hall, emotions started surging up Ku Yun’s heart as tears welled up in his eyes. He was trying his best not to let his tears roll down.

“This is…” But all of a sudden, Ku Yun’s face changed when he discovered something different about the Firecloud Pellet on the table. Picking it up, he saw the Firecloud Spiritual Rune drawn beneath it. In fact, there were a total of three of them! All of them had been successfully imprinted with the Firecloud Spiritual Rune!

When he recalled Lin Yun’s concentrated expression despite his tattered clothes, Ku Yun’s face changed drastically. His body trembled and the Firecloud Pellet fell from his hand.

“That kid… I’m a bastard! I actually let someone like him go!” Guilt started pouring into his heart and tears rolled down Ku Yun’s cheeks. That kid was clearly a genius and the brush wouldn’t have been destroyed if he hadn’t interrupted Lin Yun’s focus.

He had scolded Lin Yun so badly, but Lin Yun did not rebuke him at all. He had lived for dozens of years, so he couldn’t even be compared to a child. Wiping the tears on his face, Ku Yun rushed out of his Alchemy Chamber in a panic. He had to find Lin Yun!

When Lin Yun came out of the Pellet Hall, he bumped into an old acquaintance, Huangfu Jingxuan.

“What a coincidence! Brother Lin, how were the past three days for you? Was it a relief that you’re finally free from suffering?” joked Huangfu Jingxuan.

However, Lin Yun only responded with a wry smile. He did not want to go deeper into the topic.

“Get out of the way!” A roar suddenly came from the hall. Liu Yue and Hu Xingyang were walking over in a hurry. When Lin Yun and Huangfu Jingxuan saw them, their faces changed drastically.

“Capture him!” Hu Xingyang grinned.

Huangfu Jingxuan’s face changed and he interrupted, “Wait! Deacon Hu, do you have any idea who he is?”

“Of course I do, but this is the Pellet Hall. He ruined Master Ku Yun’s Spiritual Rune Brush and wanted to escape. This time, not even Elder Luo Feng can save him, let alone Xin Yan!” Hu Xingyang laughed.

Liu Yue folded her arms and sneered, “Little sword slave, you’re in deep trouble this time. Don’t think that you can leave here alive. Stay here and become a herb slave!”

Huangfu Jingxuan’s face changed drastically when he heard this. Not only him, but the faces of everyone in the hall had changed. Master Ku Yun might have an irritable temperament, but he was one of the stronger batches of one star spiritualists here.

Destroying Master Ku Yun’s Spiritual Rune Brush was the same as slapping the Pellet Hall’s face. So the Pellet Hall would be thoroughly humiliated if Lin Yun was let off so easily.

When Lin Yun saw Liu Yue and Hu Xingyang, his face turned dark. Liu Yue was really vicious, trying to force him into desperate straits.

“Master Ku Yun is coming!” Someone exclaimed when they saw a figure hurrying over.

When Hu Xingyang turned around and saw Master Ku Yun, a fawning smile radiated from his face and he spoke out, “Master, we know that Lin Yun has destroyed your Spiritual Rune Brush, so we’re going to turn him into a herb slave. Don’t worry. The Pellet Hall will definitely not let him off so easily.”

“Get lost!” Ku Yun’s response had taken everyone by surprise when he pushed Hu Xingyang away and stood in front of Lin Yun. Looking at Lin Yun’s tender face, Ku Yun couldn’t help feeling guilty and got down on his knees, “Lin Yun, I have wronged you!”

His action had left everyone dumbfounded. No one had expected that Ku Yun would kneel to Lin Yun. Even the cold sneer on Liu Yue and Hu Xingyang’s faces had frozen.
