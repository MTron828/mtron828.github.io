Chapter 1836 - Golden-Purple Dragon Crown

The white-robed man briefly confronted the woman before the woman smiled, “How can I address you?”

“Tian Xing.” The white-clothed man said. “What about you?”

“Tian Xuan. You can call me Madam Tian.” the woman smiled.

“Lady… Sweet?” Mei Zihua muttered, and the woman gave him a smile that instantly made him feel uncomfortable.

“Madam Tian, since you’re such a beauty, can I ask about your husband?” The white-clothed man asked in a slight surprise.

“My husband is deceased, so let’s not mention him.” Madam Tian smiled.

A widow? Lin Yun inwardly muttered, but he couldn’t see through the identity of this woman, as well as the white-clothed man. But he was certain they both sealed off their cultivations, and their actual strengths were stronger than Gu Jun.

Gu Jun was already at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage. So did this mean these two were at least quasi-saints or saints?

Lin Yun’s face changed, and he didn’t dare to think more about it. But he didn’t have to be too concerned in the Black Tortoise Void Sea. These two had to be careful instead. After all, if they couldn’t control their strength well, their outcome would be uncertain. Lin Yun and the others would be fine, but those with a higher cultivation would die faster, and the remnant deities’ power wouldn’t care about your identity.

This was also the reason why saints weren’t willing to come here, even if they could seal their cultivation. At the thought of that, Lin Yun’s expression eased, and he said, “The two of you must be here for the Black Thunder Saint Canon, and I do possess the Black Tortoise Secret Key. If you guys need it, I can offer it with both of my hands. I won’t be entering the Black Thunder Saint Palace.”

“You can come with us. There’s only one Black Tortoise Secret Key, so who are you going to give it to? Do you want us to fight amongst ourselves before determining… or are you planning to make us fight amongst ourselves?” The white-clothed man smiled.

“Let’s go, then.” Lin Yun said with a wry smile.

As the bronze gate gradually opened, Lin Yun and An Liuyan entered first with Gu Jun and Mei Zihua following behind. The man wearing a bamboo hat briefly hesitated before following after them, but he clearly kept a distance between himself and Lin Yun’s party. As for the white-clothed man and Madam Tian, they walked together and followed after everyone else.

When they passed through the bronze gate and stepped into the Black Thunder Saint Palace, an ancient aura blew towards them, as though they had gone back to the Golden Era. There were many passages in front of them that were like spiderwebs. If there were stone gates obstructing the way, they could just push the door open and walk in.

“Which passage are we taking?” Lin Yun asked, looking at Gu Jun.

Gu Jun was a descendant of the Black Tortoise Clan, and he was definitely more familiar with this place than him. Even if Gu Jun had never been here before, his intuition was definitely better than his.

Lin Yun’s words instantly drew everyone’s attention to Gu Jun, and this placed the old man under great pressure, especially when the woman looked at him with a squinting smile.

But this made Mei Zihua begin to wonder if his charm wasn’t as strong as the old man's. Back on the Black Tortoise Ship, the woman had treated the old man differently, so this naturally made him jealous.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Actually, we don’t have to bother Senior Gu. I have an idea.” Mei Zihua coughed and said modestly.

Seeing that Mei Zihua was going to put on an act again, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling speechless.

“Haha, that sounds like a good idea.” Gu Jun let out a breath of relief, and smiled as he looked at Mei Zihua, “Go on. You can lead the way.”

Mei Zihua pondered for a long time before he said, “These maze-like passages should be the Star Formation Art of the Mo Clan, and I have some research in it.”

“Oh? This young friend is proficient in Star Formation Art. I’m genuinely surprised.” The woman’s eyes shone brightly after hearing what Mei Zihua said.

“Haha, I just know a little.” Mei Zihua wore a smug smile, and he continued, “There are eight passages ahead of us, and each one can lead to the main hall. But if we pick the right one, it can save us a lot of time and trouble.”

“These eight passages represent the eight gates, so we’ll be fine if we pick the life gate. I’m guessing this one.” Mei Zihua pointed to a passage.

But this instantly made Gu Jun’s face change, and he awkwardly said, “I don’t think that’s the right passage.”

“Why not? Senior Gu, why don’t you pick one, then?” Mei Zihua asked, and this instantly placed Gu Jun in a dilemma.

“Let’s go with this, then.” The woman smiled. “Young Brother, you can lead the way.”

Lin Yun had no opinion about it because he also didn’t have a better option right now. Thus, they executed their movement techniques and headed into the passage that Mei Zihua pointed out. Although they ran into some troubles along the way, they were able to deal with them easily. Along the way, they would run into some secret chambers, but they merely took a few glances at them before continuing their journey.

Lin Yun also had no other thoughts right now. He only wanted to shake off the woman and white-clothed man. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have any sense of security. As for the Black Thunder Saint Canon, his desire for it had greatly dropped.

The journey was just as Mei Zihua said. They didn’t run into any troubles along the way, and they came to a stop an hour later. Before them was a purple-jade platform that was over ten thousand feet high. They could see lightning flickers at the top of the platform. There was an ancient hall there, and that should be the main hall.

“How fast…” Lin Yun muttered to himself, and the journey was smoother than they had expected. It appears that the old man knew the right path, but they would have probably ran into some trouble if they took the other passages. He had no idea what the old man was guarding against, but was that woman really so terrifying?

In the dark space, Lin Yun squinted his eyes and looked at the woman with doubt. The woman was standing there, chatting with the white-clothed man, and their topic revolved around the inheritance of the Black Tortoise Clan. The two were knowledgeable about the past and present, along with a deep understanding of the Black Tortoise Clan.

Sensing his gaze, the woman looked over and gave him a smile. Her smile looked familiar for some reason, but he couldn’t recall when he saw it. She had a similar temperament to Yue Weiwei, but their appearances were different. Aside from that, she was nothing like anyone he knew. So where did this person come from?

Lin Yun shifted his gaze away, and they soon came to a massive hall. This place had a radius of a thousand miles, with towering stone pillars, looking majestic. The dome looked like there were stars revolving, and the Black Tortoise Constellation could be seen in that ancient starry sky.

Standing before it, Lin Yun felt insignificant, and there was lightning flowing at the top of the stone pillars, like cocoons enveloping countless treasures. They were either artifacts, martial techniques, pellet recipes, or various scrolls. This was a treasure vault.

This shocked Lin Yun because he had visited many ruins before in the past. But this Heavenly Thunder Palace definitely had the most treasures, and it was extremely complete. This was a place the Black Thunder Martial Emperor used his life to protect, and not even the Thunder Black Tortoise’s lineage had enough time to take anything away.

“Young Master, is this the Black Tortoise Vault?” An Liuyan curiously looked around. Even if she had seen a lot, she couldn’t help feeling shocked.

“Oh my god, this is too unbelievable!” Mei Zihua exclaimed.

Right then, countless people flew over and more people began to appear in this hall.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes and noticed that they were all holy land geniuses, along with demonic cultivators on the Demonic Ranking. But they were completely shocked when they arrived.

“Young Master, look over there!” An Liuyan pointed in a certain direction. On the other end, there was a throne leaning against a wall, and there was a massive Thunder Black Tortoise diagram on the wall. On the throne was the crystal statue of a woman, and she was wearing a crown. It wasn’t a feminine crown but an actual king crown.

On this golden-purple crown, there was a golden-purple divine dragon coiling around it, overflowing with light. The dragon looked noble, like an ornament decorating the crown and making it look magnificent. It was simply too beautiful.

Even Lin Yun couldn’t help exclaiming because this was a Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. This was a supreme treasure of the Dragon Clan, and the Black Thunder Martial Emperor probably married a woman possessing the dragon’s bloodline. So the value of the crown was immeasurable.

This crystallized mysterious woman was also wearing a golden-purple dragon armor, and no one dared to look at her directly. If they took several more glances at her, it would make them feel the impulse to go down on their knees, so this meant that this woman was probably at the Emperor Realm when she was alive. But for some reason, seeing that crystal statue made Lin Yun think of Su Ziyao.

There were two statues standing on both sides in front of the throne, and those statues were wielding a golden-purple halbert with dragons engraved on the halberts.

“The Golden-Purple Dragon Crown!” Just when Lin Yun was examining the crystal statue, countless gazes fell onto the crown the crystal woman statue was wearing. After all, there was a high possibility that the crown she wore was a Sovereign Saint Artifact.

“It’s really the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown! Oh my god! It’s the supreme treasure of the Dragon Clan!”

“It’s so beautiful!” Lin Yun was surprised. For some reason, he had a strong desire for the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.

Just when everyone indulged in it, Lin Yun was the first to make a move and rapidly rushed over.

“Ha. Not fast enough!” The man wearing a bamboo hat glanced at Lin Yun and charged over as well.

“Quick, stop them!”

“The Golden-Purple Dragon Crown might be a Sovereign Saint Artifact!” Everyone in the hall went insane, and they charged towards the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. The entire hall instantly became chaotic because no one could stop the temptation of the Sovereign Saint Artifact.

But the white-clothed man and Madam Tian weren't too interested in it. Their eyes were on the starry sky. The starry sky looked like liquid, decorated with the Black Tortoise Constellation. It was as though the starry sky had a lethal temptation that attracted their attention.

A brief moment later, the white-clothed man smiled, “Madam Tian, you’re not interested in the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown? It’s a Sovereign Saint Artifact that we’re talking about.”

“That belongs to the Divine Dragon Empire, and it’ll be a hot potato in anyone’s hands. No one can use it without the royal clan’s bloodline.” Madam Tian smiled.

“Madam Tian, you seem pretty familiar with the Divine Dragon Empire. After all, not everyone knows about the royal clan’s existence…” The white-clothed man said with a deep smile.

“Are we considered ordinary people?” Madam Tian said with a playful smile.

Not commenting on it, the white-clothed man smiled, “Madam Tian, who do you think can obtain the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown?”

Gracefully standing there, Madam Tian revealed a bewitching smile, “Who knows? Perhaps that Nirvana Banquet’s champion or that young lad with the bamboo hat. Who knows, perhaps Young Master Mei also has a chance.”
