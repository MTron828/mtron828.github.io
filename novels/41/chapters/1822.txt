Chapter 1823 - Black Tortoise Core

But when An Liuyan’s fan was about to reach the white-clothed man, a dazzling sword ray shining from his pupils without him doing anything. The massive dragon origin contained in the fan was struck by nine sword rays.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

When the sword rays blocked An Liuyan’s fan, they began to tremble before a powerful sword intent burst from the white-clothed man. The shockwave of sword intent made An Liuyan’s face drastically change, and the fan was sent flying away before it could do anything.

“Go down.” The white-clothed man’s hand flicked, and a radiating sword ray turned into a gushing sword aura, sending An Liuyan flying away.

“What a powerful sword intent!” Lin Yun’s expression became grave when he saw this scene because An Liuyan was at the pinnacle of first stage Profound Life Stage. With the inheritance saint artifact in her hand, she could even put up a fight with those at the second stage Profound Life Stage. With the addition of her White Dragon Bone, she could become even more unfathomable.

But the white-clothed man didn’t make a move and easily sent An Liuyan flying away. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that she couldn’t even put up a fight against this person. The faces of Mei Zihua and Gu Jun changed. This was the first time they saw someone’s sword intent to be comparable to Lin Yun's.

“I don’t care who you are, but this saint origin belongs to me. No one can snatch it away from me!” Lin Yun’s face sank, and he flicked his finger to unleash a powerful sword ray. When the sword ray flew out, it turned into a massive dragon. This was naturally Lin Yun’s secret technique, the Flicking Divine Finger.

Lin Yun didn’t bother concealing his strength while facing this person. He wanted to see how strong this person’s sword intent was. The white-clothed person also unleashed a sword ray at Lin Yun’s incoming attack. When the two sword rays collided, they created a series of sword cries before exploding. They were evenly matched in this confrontation.

“This is interesting…” The white-clothed man stood up with a playful gaze.

On the other hand, Lin Yun’s face became grave because he knew he had run into a formidable foe. He drew the Flower Burial Sword and charged over without any hesitation, appearing before the white-clothed man in the blink of an eye, swinging his sword at him. His speed was fast, but his sword was even faster, creating hundreds of sword rays that enveloped the other party.

“Hahaha! Great!” The white-clothed man laughed and started waving his hand, unleashing countless sword rays from his body.

For a moment, countless sword rays clashed around them, and the white-clothed man retreated while he fended off Lin Yun’s attacks. When he took ten steps back, the white-clothed man suddenly stopped, and said, “It's time to bring this to an end!”

When his thumb pressed down on his middle finger, a horrifying sword intent swept out that restricted Lin Yun’s movements. The sword intent he gave off also caused a violent gale to rise, and his clothes violently fluttered in the wind.

At this moment, time seemed to have frozen and Lin Yun couldn’t move. The sword rays around him couldn’t even move. That was the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at complete mastery. This made Lin Yun’s heart sink with his eyes squinted from the great pressure he felt.

When the white-clothed man flicked his finger, the sword rays around Lin Yun shattered, sending the latter flying away.

“Alright, it has come to an end now.” The white-clothed man then turned to look at An Liuyan, Mei Zihua, and Gu Jun before smiling, “The three of you should behave yourselves, especially you. I have already noticed all your movements.”

Those words made Gu Jun embarrassed, and he awkwardly smiled. He wanted to bring out the tortoiseshell shield, but the white-clothed man had already discovered it.

The white-clothed man lazily stretched his body before he sighed, “It has been a long time since I fought anyone. That brat is pretty good. It's no wonder why he’s first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. Hahaha!”

His sudden burst of laughter was weird, and this made Lin Yun flustered because he had a feeling that this person knew his identity. He asked, “Senior, you know me?”

“Who doesn’t know the Nirvana Banquet’s champion?” The white-clothed man smiled. “I know you, but you might not know me.”

“Senior, who are you?” Lin Yun asked. He had a feeling that this person was deep and unfathomable to easily use the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at complete mastery. He even had a terrifying speculation that this person’s sword intent might be stronger than what he had shown.

“You don’t have to know who I am for now. Perhaps we will meet again?” The white-clothed man looked at Lin Yun deeply, and he continued, “Haha, you have really given me a great surprise. Mei Zihua of one of the Ten Musical Clans, the Nine-Star Demon Venerable An Liuyan, and the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s Elder. Interesting… interesting… hahaha!”

When his laughter fell, sword rays began to shine from him and he flew off before Lin Yun could even say a word.

Looking at the direction this person left in, Lin Yun wore a grave expression because of how unfathomable this person was.

“Young Master, that person is strong.” An Liuyan walked over.

“You’re not injured, are you?” Lin Yun nodded, but his heart was in chaos. This Heavenly Thunder Palace was really filled with hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Just earlier, that person gave him a feeling that he wasn’t an enemy.

“I’m fine. He held back.” An Liuyan replied.

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he fell into deep thoughts. He had a feeling that the white-clothed man wasn’t willing to hurt them. In the end, he sighed, “Let’s get going, then.”

“Hehe, no need to hurry. You guys can leave first. I’ll find a way to refine this Black Tortoise Totem before catching up to you guys.” Gu Jun smiled.

“Didn’t you say only descendants of the Black Tortoise can refine this Black Tortoise Totem?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“About that… I’m only bullshitting. There’s no harm in giving it a try. Maybe it might work?” Gu Jun was still stubborn and wasn’t willing to admit that he was a descendant of the Black Tortoise.

“Alright, then.” Lin Yun said. It would be great if Gu Jun could refine it. No matter what, it was a sacred artifact of the Black Tortoise’s lineage.

“Elder Gu, be careful. Remember to look for us because we still have to depend on you.” An Liuyan smiled.

Hearing that, Gu Jun smiled, “Brat, you hear that? Boss An knows how to speak. Don’t worry about it. With me around, no one can harm you in the Heavenly Thunder Palace!”

Lin Yun was speechless upon hearing that because he nearly died just a moment ago. After bidding farewell to Gu Jun, they continued their journey into the depths of the Heavenly Thunder Palace. Along the way, they ran into many Profound Life Stage experts wandering around.

Although the Heavenly Thunder Palace was destroyed in the ancient battle, it still looked grand and majestic. During their search, they naturally found some treasures. But the moment those treasures appeared, it would spark a competition. As a result, many people died in the chaos.

“Brother Lin, you’re not afraid of that old man running away? He might go to the cellar himself, and there might even be demigod wine! Not to mention the Mo Clan’s Millennium Flame!” Mei Zihua said with flames blazing in his pupils.

“Don’t worry. If those treasures really are there, the old man will definitely come and look for us.” Lin Yun smiled confidently.

Based on his understanding of Gu Jun, if the other party could find those treasures alone, he would definitely sneak over by himself. The old man wouldn’t even tell them about it. The greatest reason for Gu Jun to be following him might be the tortoiseshell he had.

The tortoiseshell was special, and the old man might have seen something. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have taken the risk to come to the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

Although Mei Zihua was feeling skeptical, he decided not to ask anything about it. They naturally ran into treasures along the way, but Lin Yun merely took a glance before continuing their journey. Those treasures were of high quality, but Lin Yun didn’t feel that they were worth wasting time for.

As the group of three went deeper, they would run into more buildings, and the density of demonspirit aura became denser. Just looking at the tattered ruins alone was enough to imagine how intense this battle was, and they couldn’t imagine the scale of the battle. They even began to wonder if they really won the battle.

“Young Master, there are sounds there!” An Liuyan suddenly spoke up, interrupting Lin Yun’s trail of thoughts.

“It sounds like lightning… powerful lightning…” Mei Zihua stammered because he didn’t know how to describe the sound.

“Let’s go and take a look.” Lin Yun said, and the three immediately changed their direction.

An hour later, they arrived at the foot of the mountain. When they raised their heads, there was a lake before them, but the lake was made up of lightning magma.

“The Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool!” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked, because this place was actually a massive tribulation pool. The Black Tortoise’s lineage actually created an artificial tribulation pool for their descendants to cultivate, and this was something even ordinary holy lands couldn’t accomplish.

This made him wonder how magnificent the golden era was a hundred thousand years ago. After all, one must know there were thirty-five other similar heavenly palaces, and he could feel his scalp going numb from just imagining it.

If he was in the Golden Era, he probably would have the current strength of his physique at the Elysium Core Realm. That was what Lin Yun thought when he looked at the lightning pool.

Right then, mysterious fluctuations rippled on the lake, and a flash of fist-sized lightning shot out. It was a core that completely consisted of lightning. The inside of the core emitted an ancient and fascinating radiance.

“What’s that?” Mei Zihua asked curiously.

“It’s the Black Tortoise Core!” An Liuyan was shocked, and Lin Yun also recognized it because he saw records of it on the bamboo scroll. There were legends that after a Black Tortoise’s descendant reached the Quasi-Saint Realm, they could condense a Lightning Heart within their bodies. Over time, the Lightning Heart would gradually solidify and condense into the Black Tortoise Core.

The moment the core was formed, it wouldn’t disappear even when a hundred thousand years have passed. Only the Black Tortoise’s descendants with outstanding talent could condense the core, and each one was extremely rare. This was because the value was unimaginable. It could be refined into an infant’s body before they were born.

This was a safe process, and there was a chance that the infant would possess the Black Tortoise Saint Physique at birth. There were even rumors that if one refined the Black Tortoise Core, they could easily grasp the Lightning Intent.

If one was lucky enough, a single Black Tortoise Core could even enable a person’s physique to reach the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage. It was so much so that they could even obtain the Black Tortoise’s inheritance from the remnant information contained within the core.

“The Black Tortoise Core!” Lin Yun’s pupils blazed with flames. He finally found a treasure that could catch his eyes. Regardless if he used it for himself or gave it away, it was extremely valuable.

After all, Lin Yun was broke and had an urgent need for resources. So he didn’t hesitate to reach the pool’s heart and reach out for the Black Tortoise Core.

But just when he was about to come in contact with the Black Tortoise Core, a dazzling radiance enveloped the entire pool, and a beam of light swiftly shot towards the center of Lin Yun’s brows.

This made Lin Yun slightly furrow his brows and raised his hand to smash the beam apart. But he was sent flying by the force that was behind the beam, and he took ten steps back before he finally managed to regain his foothold.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw a familiar figure in the mid-air. It was a purple-clothed youth, with his pupils emitting a faint chill. “Yu Wenxiu!”

By the lakeside, Huang Xuanyi and the other disciples of the Ming Cult were also gathered.
