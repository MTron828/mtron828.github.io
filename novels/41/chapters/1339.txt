Chapter 1340 - Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng

Nangong Ze nearly died from the rage. Not only did the baldie call him ugly, but Luo Shuyi also called him ugly. But he also deserved it because Luo Shuyi was clearly still fuming from what happened, and he failed to recognize the mood. So it would be weird if Luo Shuyi didn’t dislike him. Furthermore, she was already very polite because Nangong Ze clearly had no idea how terrifying it was to offend a woman.

“The origin of that tablet is extraordinary. I even suspect that there’s an origin saint rune in it, and the words are restrictions.” Tang Jing transmitted his voice to Luo Shuyi because it was clearly impossible for him to let Nangong Ze know about it.

“If that’s the case, then I’m afraid that the value of that stone tablet will far exceed our imagination,” replied Luo Shuyi. Most origin saint runes were born alongside saint elixirs, beast bones, or in ore veins. But origin saint runes sealed in a stone tablet were simply unheard of.

Suddenly, Luo Shuyi wondered if the stone tablet was a beast bone itself or the stone tablet was the remains of a golden crow!

While the two were in a swift discussion, they began to feel that the stone tablet was extraordinary and had a huge origin. This made Nangong Ze’s eyes flicker. He could see that their lips were moving but there was no voice coming from them, so he could instantly figure out that they were transmitting their voices secretly.

This immediately made him feel like he was invisible and made him anxious. He could sense that they were discussing something important and smiled. “Tang Jing, you’re the young lord of the Profound Valley, and your attainment in the spiritual runes far exceeds us. So do you know anything about the origin of that stone tablet? Why don’t you share it with me?”

But Tang Jing merely cast a glance at him, then ignored him. This made Nangong Ze furious and cursed inwardly.

“Let’s go!” Luo Shuyi executed her movement technique and left in the direction Cang Yun escaped.

Seeing this, Nangong Ze snickered, “Tang Jing, your goddess has left. Why aren’t you quickly following her? If you don’t chase after her now, you won’t even be able to be her puppy.”

Those words made Tang Jing’s face turn black as he replied, “Nangong Ze, you should take a closer look at your appearance in the mirror. Drink more water or you won't even know how you die one day!”

When Tang Jing talked with Nangong Ze, Luo Shuyi was already far away and Tang Jing quickly circulated his movement technique to catch up to her.

“That puppy is really fast.” Nangong Ze smacked his lips because he didn’t expect that a saint spiritualist like Tang Jing would be so fast. But recalling what Tang Jing said, he was even more baffled, “But what did he mean by those words?”

“You don’t understand?” As Zhang Jin and Ning Feng came over, Ning Feng smiled, “He means that you’re not only ugly, but your mouth stinks.”

Nangong Ze cussed, “That sissy from the Profound Valley is really vicious when it comes to insults. He’s not a man at all!”

“Let’s not bother about that, for now. Tang Jing definitely discovered the secret of the stone tablet.” Zhang Jing said with a light flashing through his pupils. “Since we’re not going to compete for the Great Saint Origin, we have to obtain the stone tablet, no matter what. 108 mountains might seem huge, but there aren’t many real treasures. That stone tablet might be the most precious treasure around, aside from the Great Saint Origin.”

Nangong Ze and Ning Feng shared the same feelings as well. But Nangong Ze suddenly looked around before he asked, “Where’s Dugu Yan?”

“Let’s not bother about him. If it was not for him, that damned baldie wouldn’t have been able to escape.” Zhang Jing had flames blazing in his eyes. Dugu Yan had practically ruined it all for them, not to mention that Dugu Yan nearly killed them when he couldn’t control his eyes properly.

“Let’s go! Chase after them!” After making up their minds, the three chased after Cang Yun, determined to seize the stone tablet.

At the same time, there were also other people who had reached the summit of the other mountains. The mountains were extremely dangerous. Even Greater Elysium Core Realm experts weren’t confident about reaching the summits.

On the summit of a certain mountain, there was a complete palace there. Gongsun Yan and Zhao Yan had come before the palace with great difficulty, and Gongsun Yan was excited. Looking at Zhao Yan standing beside him, Gongsun Yan was happy because he was smart to drag Zhao Yan along or he would definitely not be able to climb the mountain.

After reaching the Elysium Core Realm, Zhao Yan’s strength had undergone a terrifying transformation, and he was comparable to fated transcendents now. This nearly made Gongsun Yan’s jaw fall off because Zhao Yan was clearly incomparable to him when he was at the Empyrean Realm.

“There’s someone inside. Looks like someone’s ahead of us.” Zhao Yan suddenly said as light returned to his eyes.

“Someone’s inside? How many are there?” Gongsun Yan asked. But when he didn’t receive a reply, he turned his head to see that Zhao Yan had returned to his dazed state and began to sway from left to right.

“This fool…” Gongsun Yan’s lips twitched. “I’ll enter first, then.”

When he was done, he quickly entered the palace without caring for Zhao Yan’s reply. He was already used to Zhao Yan’s actions, and who knew how long Zhao Yan would wake up from his current state? Now that he thought about it again, Zhao Yan was really weird. Sometimes when he fought with demonic beasts, he would even daze off and was nearly killed by the demonic beast.

Gongsun Yan executed his movement technique and carefully hid his aura. He passed through many chambers along the way before he saw that there were quite a few people fighting amongst themselves. They were all practically Greater Elysium Core Realm experts, and Gongsun Yan didn’t hesitate to run the moment he saw them.

An hour later, he entered a palace. This palace had a stone pillar, and there was a scroll on top of the stone pillar. The blood stains in the palace were obvious, and there were two people before the stone pillar, looking at the painting with greed in their eyes. Gongsun Yan quickly hid his aura and tried to sneak in, but his presence was immediately detected.

“Another one has come to die?” The two people smiled and turned around. When Gongsun Yan saw their appearances, he was left completely stumped.

“So it’s the disciples of the Profound Sky Sect.” Gongsun Yan smiled when he saw the two people. They were both donned in the uniform of the Profound Sky Sect. Gongsun Yan might be a coward and run the moment he sees Greater Elysium Core Realm experts, but he wasn’t weak. He might not be comparable to fated transcendents, but he could compete with ordinary disciples of the powerful sects.

“Gongsun Yan!” The two disciples locked their brows together. Clearly, they weren’t unfamiliar with Gongsun Yan. After all, Gongsun Yan was ranked in the top thousandth on the Empyrean Ranking and even claimed to be from the Sword Emperor’s lineage. So he had quite the fame in the Ancient Barren Domain.

“Get lost!” Gongsun Yan said in an arrogant tone.

His words quickly triggered the two Profound Sky Sect’s disciples to attack him. Even if Gongsun Yan was a genius of the Sword Emperor’s lineage, he was a little too much with his arrogance.

“How ignorant.” Gongsun Yan sneered. He might not be able to defeat fated transcendents, but these ordinary geniuses were nothing in his eyes. The battle between them also ended quickly in just half an hour with him defeating the two Profound Sky Sect’s disciples.

“Don’t let me see you guys again in this palace or I’ll beat you guys up every time I see you. Others might fear the Profound Sky Sect, but I’m definitely not one of them!” Gongsun Yan didn’t dare to kill them and decided to let them go.

Since fated transcendents and Greater Elysium Core Realm experts could be found everywhere in the Profound Wither Island, he could only clamp his tail between his legs. But in reality, he was an arrogant and aloof person like he was in the Hidden Sword Pavilion.

Gongsun Yan swept a gaze at the scroll and his eyes lit up. He stepped forth and wasted some time before he managed to obtain the scroll. Looking at the scroll in his hand, Gongsun Yan couldn’t contain his excitement anymore, “I got it!”

He was feeling emotional because it might be a huge opportunity for him. But when the scroll flew out and opened up, it was a portrait that left him disappointed because it wasn’t a dao painting.

“H-H-How is this possible?!” But when the scroll opened up, Gongsun Yan was stumped with his mouth wide open. His face had turned pale because this had far exceeded his imagination, and he was absolutely familiar with the person on the portrait. It was the Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng!

As the founder of the Skysolute City, he was someone who sliced two peaks off the Sword Sect back then, causing the Sword Sect to be unable to recover their position as a holy land.

As a genius from the Sword Emperor’s lineage, he grew up in the Skysolute City, so he was definitely familiar with the Sword Emperor’s portrait. Most importantly, he had no idea why the Sword Emperor’s portrait was in the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda.

Suddenly, Gongsun Yan’s face changed as he recalled the rumors that many people came after the Profound Wither Great Saint after the Southern Emperor died. There were rumors that the other emperors also looked for the Profound Wither Great Saint as well. So this made him wonder if the Sword Emperor had also looked for the Profound Wither Great Saint.

Thinking about it here, Gongsun Yan’s face became ugly because the Sword Emperor was someone he deeply respected. But the nine emperors were like siblings back then, founding the Divine Dragon Empire to end the Darkest Era. They were friends, comrades, and people who could give their lives for each other.

So it wasn’t glorious that someone from the nine emperors would go after the Southern Emperor’s disciple after his death, and Gongsun Yan didn’t want to believe that the Sword Emperor had done something like that. But the portrait before him was ironclad proof.

After being in a daze for a long time, Gongsun Yan muttered to himself, “It’s just a portrait and it can’t prove anything. Who’s the Sword Emperor? How can he possibly do something so shameless? Just what am I thinking…”

When he was done, he recollected himself and stowed the portrait. But right at that moment, he could hear footsteps and two familiar auras. Gongsun Yan turned around and said in an annoyed tone, “Why did the two of you come back? Didn’t I say that I’ll beat the two of you up every time I see you guys?”

But he was soon dumbfounded because the two Profound Sky Sect’s disciples didn’t come back alone. They brought along one of the Three Saints of the Profound Sky Sect, Lei Jue! This instantly made Gongsun Yan’s legs go soft and his face ugly. At this moment, he was wondering what kind of luck he would have to run into Lei Jue here.

“You’ll beat us up every time you see us?” Lei Jue sneered as he looked at Gongsun Yan whose legs were trembling. He suddenly dropped his smile and roared, “Kneel!”
