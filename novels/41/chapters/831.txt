Chapter 832 - Fight!

When Yue Weiwei left the stage, her face was a lot paler than before. The Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s pavilion master’s eyes flashed with concern as he transmitted his voice over to her, “Princess, your injuries haven’t gotten any better. You can’t use the Heavenly Note Art anymore. As for Lin Yun… If I remember correctly, his relationship with the holy maiden of the Profound Imperial Palace isn’t simple.

Hearing that, Yue Weiwei blushed before she smiled, “I know. But he’s my Big Brother Yun. I don’t want anyone to bully him.”

The Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s pavilion master instantly became speechless. Yue Weiwei was simply too stubborn, but then again, she wouldn’t be here if she wasn’t. Even her father, the Moondevil Demon Emperor couldn’t deal with her, not to mention a mere pavilion master like him.

The only fights Lin Yun had left were against Zhu Qingshan, Zhao Wuji, and Yu Haotian. At this moment, the ongoing fight was between Jiang Ziye and Zhu Qingshan. The outcome of this battle was important because Zhu Qingshan could compete for third place if he won. If that happened, Jiang Ziye would be stuck in fifth place.

Zhu Qingshan’s blade technique was unfathomable, but Jiang Ziye’s cloud intent had undergone a few changes. Plus, her strongest attacks couldn’t be underestimated. Even someone as powerful as Zhu Qingshan couldn’t defeat Jiang Ziye quickly. He had to push his saber intent to the limit and unleash countless blade rays.

“Soul Devour!” Zhu Qingshan unleashed nine blades that manifested howling ghosts towards Jiang Ziye.

“Heavenly Imprisoning Finger!” Jiang Ziye didn’t dare to be careless and instantly brought out one of her strongest attacks. An ancient finger broke through the clouds, destroying the nine blade rays and sending Zhu Qingshan flying. However, she had no intention of pursuing him and retreated. She even pushed out four different palms.

“Wind, lightning, rain, mist!” Every time she pushed out her palm, she would manifest wind, rain, fog, and rumbling lightning. Afterwards, she tried stabilizing herself by forcing Zhu Qingshan’s saber intent out of her body.

Zhu Qingshan wore a sinister smile as he stood up. Ignoring his injuries, he started to approach Jiang Ziye. When Zhu Qingshan charged over, Jiang Ziye’s face changed because she still hadn’t expelled the saber intent from her body.

“Sky Devour!” A colossal blade ray burst in flames as it shot towards Jiang Ziye. She did her best to defend herself, but she couldn’t block the sword. Jiang Ziye was sent flying after she was wounded on her right shoulder.

“You lost.” Zhu Qingshan said coldly with no intention to keep going. Jiang Ziye let out a sigh because she knew that her journey had come to an end. She was fated to come in fifth place.

This year’s banquet proved to be intense. Jiang Ziye was the only one among the seven elites who made it into the top ten.

The next battle was between Bai Lixuan and Mu Han. Mu Han was stronger because of his quasi-spiritual sword intent, but his injuries from Yan Long’zi were too severe. So Bai Lixuan and Mu Han were evenly matched. The outcome would come down to whoever could find the other person’s flaw first. However, Bai Lixuan could end it if he made a breakthrough in his lightning sword intent.

After 100 moves later, Fang Hanluo barely won by relying on his Indigo Frost Battle Physique. Once this battle concluded, the crowd became nervous. Lin Yun was next and he still had three opponents to fight.

“Next battle, Lin Yun VS Zhao Wuji!” The chief judge made an announcement that excited the crowd. Although it was already night time, the crowd was still lively .

Zhu Qingshan had lost to Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji, so no one was optimistic about him. All that was left was to see if Lin Yun could take second place.

Without realizing, many people placed their hopes on Lin Yun. Zhao Wuji also took note of Lin Yun and decided not to underestimate him. After all, this battle was too important. His way of thinking was completely different from the beginning of the tournament as he thought his only opponent was Yu Haotian.

However, he was treating Lin Yun seriously now. From a certain angle, his personality was similar to Lin Yun’s personality. Both of them kept a low profile and they had many hidden trump cards. Additionally, both of them knew they couldn’t stay hidden forever as only one of them could keep their Five-Clawed Golden Dragon.

When Lin Yun got to the stage, his appearance caused a huge uproar. Lin Yun was still holding onto his sword and his Azure Dragon Sword Aura could vaguely be seen right behind him. The Azure Dragon Sword Aura was offsetting the pressure coming from Zhao Wuji. In return, Zhao Wuji also released his aura, causing the atmosphere to become tense. All of the spectators held their breath when they sensed the atmosphere.

Lin Yun wore a slightly grave expression because he knew that Zhao Wuji’s thunder intent and cloud intent was comparable to his xiantian sword intent in complete mastery. He noticed it after seeing how easily Bai Lixuan’s lightning intent crumbled.

Furthermore, Zhao Wuji’s thundercloud intent wasn’t inferior to his Azure Dragon Sword Aura. In fact, it might even be a little stronger, which brought Lin Yun great pressure. Fortunately, his Azure Dragon Aura had grown after reaching the nonaform or he else might have to use his trump card.

“I’ve already seen the blade in your eyes. There’s no meaning for you to keep it hiding after I draw my sword,” said Lin Yun, revealing a piece of shocking information.

“Impressive, but I had no intention of hiding it from you. This blade is called Autumn Voice. I found it in an ancient ruin and it should be slightly stronger than your Flower Burial sword.” Zhao Wuji gently tapped his interspatial pouch and took out a blade that emitted a chilling aura.

“Fight!” The aura coming from Lin Yun started to grow even more terrifying.

“Thundercloud Slash!” When Zhao Wuji drew his blade, he activated his thundercloud intent and unleashed a terrifying attack towards Lin Yun. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, Lin Yun had already drawn his sword without anyone knowing and a cold light shined in the sky. When his sword collided with Zhao Wuji’s blade, sparks began to fly like an army galloping through the battlefield.

With a flash, Lin Yun instantly appeared beside Zhao Wuji with his sword directed at the back of Zhao Wuji’s neck. Lin Yun’s sword was fast and ruthless, instantly placing Zhao Wuji in a disadvantageous position. At this moment, it looked like Lin Yun was casually brandishing his sword. From this, everyone could tell that Lin Yun had gained many attainments in the way of the sword throughout the banquet.

“What a brilliant sword!” Many geniuses in the top ten narrowed their eyes because Lin Yun saw through Zhao Wuji’s attack and instantly placed the latter in a disadvantageous position.

Every single strike from Lin Yun was lethal and dangerous, forcing Zhao Wuji into a defensive position before the latter could unleash his saber intent. Most importantly, the speed of Lin Yun’s sword didn’t give Zhao Wuji any opportunities to retaliate. If Zhao Wuji wasn’t careful, he would be in a dire situation.

When Bai Lixuan, Wu Xiaotian, and the others thought about this, they felt shivers in their souls. They knew that if they were in Zhao Wuji’s position, they would already be dead. However, Zhao Wuji did something that no one expected. He instantly resolved Lin Yun’s ferocious attacks in a split second.
