Chapter 1677 – Heavenly Star Cauldron

An Liuyan’s gaze was cold as it swept across Mo Ling’er. If she only had to face Fang Yan and Zhang Ying, she was confident that she could heavily injure or even kill them, despite their cultivation at the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. But it was troublesome now because there was a seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm expert, Ma Qing.

Although she could leave now if she wanted, her departure would also mean the death of Mo Ling’er. It was so much so that Mo Ling’er might even be humiliated if she left.

“You want to leave?” A cold light flashed across Ma Qing’s pupils after sensing An Liuyan’s gaze. With a snicker, he waved his hand, and Mo Ling’er flew over.

Mo Ling’er was heavily injured to begin with. Thus, she couldn’t resist the suction force from Ma Qing at all. But just when she was about to fly away, a hand grabbed onto her wrist and tugged her back.

“Who the hell are you to dare to interfere in our matters?!” Zhang Ying’s eyes flashed with ferocity while wanting to make a move against Lin Yun.

But Ma Qing stopped him as doubt flashed across his pupils. He said, “Don’t bother about him right now.”

Most importantly, he couldn’t see through Lin Yun, nor did the latter stop their fight. So he couldn’t make any judgment for now. The utmost importance was to capture An Liuyan. They spent a lot of effort on this assault, and they would suffer the Heavenly Star Pavilion’s retaliation if they failed.

“Missy, don’t care about me and leave first!” Mo Ling’er yelled. She didn’t have time to be shocked that Lin Yun would save her.

“Haha, you think you can leave?” Ma Qing said coldly. “An Liuyan, you can check to see if you can still circulate your dragon origin.”

Hearing that, An Liuyan’s face changed, and she swiftly discovered that her dragon origin was like a quagmire. No matter how she tried, she couldn’t circulate her dragon origin. She soon found the reason and exclaimed, “The Dragon Subduing Powder!”

This was a poison, but the toxin was weak and would only last for half an incense’s time. But it was odorless and colorless. Even a Samsara Edict Realm expert would fall for it if they weren’t careful. Falling for it, the victim would have difficulty circulating their dragon origin and gradually become powerless. It was hard for anyone beneath the Saint Realm to resolve this poison. But this poison was very expensive, and no one would be willing to use it on a Dragon Pulse Realm cultivator.

“I never expected the Blood Moon Sect would be willing to pay such a huge price just to capture me.” An Liuyan gritted her teeth.

“Don’t blame me. You can only blame yourself for staying on this island for so long. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have the opportunity to launch this assault.” Ma Qing replied indifferently. “Capture her!”

Fang Yan and Zhang Ying made their moves simultaneously, unleashing over a hundred swords at An Liuyan, not allowing her to execute her illusion.

An Liuyan wielded her fan and clashed with their swords head-on. When the three fought, the various buildings here crumbled under the shockwaves from their attacks. In the blink of an eye, only the pavilion that Lin Yun was in became the only unscathed building. The collapse of the surrounding buildings also caused waves to rise from the lake, and the huge commotion naturally alarmed the Heavenly Star Pavilion’s guards as they charged over.

There were many of them, but most were only at the Elysium Core Realm. Although there were some at the Dragon Pulse Realm, the strongest among them was only at the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, as this island was only located at the border of the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. It wasn’t a flourishing island, but it was rare to have so many Elysium Core Realm cultivators.

But before they could even get close, Ma Qing had already killed them. The latter was in the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, undergoing seven tribulations. This meant that his blood, skeleton, muscles, and five organs had undergone a transformation, and his boundless dragon origin was like boiling magma.

He didn’t even have to move to get rid of the guards, no matter how many came. The Dragon Pulse Realm cultivators were also defeated with an exchange. They didn’t die, but were incapacitated as they laid on the ground. As for the Heavenly Star Pavilion’s experts, they were all held down.

This scene made An Liuyan even more anxious, and this confirmed her speculation even more. While she was distracted, she took a palm from Fang Yan and was sent flying away, since she was poisoned.

“Hmph.” Ma Qing sneered, and he knew that it was just a matter of time before An Liuyan was captured.

Lin Yun’s heart trembled as he held the cup tighter. He couldn’t be bothered about the feud between the Demon Gate and Blood Moon Sect. The two forces were demonic forces, and their rivalry could go back three millennia ago.

After all, the Demon Sect struck a heavy blow to the Blood Moon Sect back then, causing the Blood Moon Sect to disappear for a thousand years. The Blood Moon Sect slowly made a comeback, especially after the death of the Southern Emperor. The Blood Moon Sect had gradually recovered to its peak now.

It was so much so that they could compete with the Demon Gate and were no longer suppressed by the them. But there was no way he could just watch when this matter involved An Liuyan, which put him in a difficult dilemma because it would spell trouble if he made a move with his current identity, not to mention that it wasn’t easy to deal with Ma Qing, either.

Lin Yun speculated that An Liuyan probably had a trump card left behind by a Saint, but she was soft-hearted and unwilling to leave Mo Ling’er behind.

While Lin Yun fell into a dilemma, An Liuyan’s situation became increasingly dangerous, and Zhang Ying took it even further. When he saw that An Liuyan was deeply affected by the poison, lust flashed across his pupils, and he wanted to quickly rip off An Liuyan’s clothes.

“Judging from Boss An’s figure, I bet you’ll look good without any clothes on. Hahaha!” Zhang Ying laughed, and he no longer held back. But right then, a saucer flew over and knocked against his wrist.

This made Zhang Ying let out a snort and he destroyed the saucer with a sword. His pupils were filled with fury when he turned to look at Lin Yun. “You’re courting death!”

But when he finished speaking, he was shocked to discover that the saucer’s fragments were trembling, and each fragment contained a terrifying sharpness that flew at him. This made Zhang Ying shocked as he brandished his sword.

Whenever he shattered a fragment, it would result in more fragments. Just like that, when Zhang Ying destroyed the fragments three times, the number of fragments increased to a height that Zhang Ying could no longer defend.

When all the fragments flew over, Zhang Ying was only barely capable of protecting his fatal spots, but he was covered in wounds. Everything happened in the blink of an eye, and everyone was shocked.

In the end, Lin Yun still made his move because he was worried about An Liuyan. Looking at the Blood Moon Sect’s party, he said, “Not only are you guys going to take advantage of your numbers, you guys even used poison? Is the Blood Moon Sect this despicable?”

“Brat, you finally can’t hold it back? Why do I have to answer you in regards to a matter of my Blood Moon Sect? You better behave yourself if you’re smart; just sit there and watch. Otherwise, there will be no spot for you in the whole Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea!” Ma Qing coldly looked at Lin Yun.

“Wow, how almighty.” Lin Yun smiled. His voice was arrogant, which made him seem unfathomable.

“Who is he?!” An Liuyan’s heart was messed up when she looked at Lin Yun from afar. She could now be sure Lin Yun wasn’t from the Blood Moon Sect. But if Lin Yun wasn’t from the Blood Moon Sect, how did he know about her surname? Could it be that her initial intuition wasn’t wrong?

Thinking about her initial intuition, An Liuyan became emotional, her chest heaving and her eyes glued on Lin Yun.

“You’re courting death!” Ma Qing finally lost his patience. “You two carry on. I’ll deal with this brat myself!”

Stomping his foot on the surface of the lake, Ma Qing flew over. When he spun the spear in his hand, a terrifying fluctuation spread through the surrounding space. This might seem like nothing impressive, but the fluctuation contained a massive dragon origin.

An ordinary Dragon Pulse Realm genius would be torn into pieces when they came in contact with it, and no opponent would have any odds of winning because of the difference in their cultivation.

Lin Yun inwardly sighed because he knew that this matter today could no longer be easily resolved. With a wave of his hand, he retrieved the Thunderstorm Zither from his interspatial bracelet and placed it on the table before him.

Just as Ma Qing’s spear was about to reach him, zither music suddenly resounded, along with a violent gale that accompanied it. This distorted gale could distort even space, and Ma Qing’s attack was knocked away.

Music Dao? This naturally surprised Ma Qing as he looked at Lin Yun in shock.

Sitting before the zither, Lin Yun looked as though he was an aristocrat, giving off a noble aura. Before anyone could react, his zither music continued to resound as bolts of lightning stopped Fang Yan and Zhang Ying, who were ganging up on An Liuyan.

Taking this opportunity, An Liuyan sat down and wanted to force the poison out of her body. But she soon discovered that she couldn’t succeed, no matter how she tried. She took a look at Lin Yun before she dove into the lake. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Wind!” Lin Yun barked, and a violent gale rose from his fingers. His white clothes began to flutter in the wind as a powerful wind descended. His musical notes were accompanied by pinnacle Firmament Sword Intent that formed into a violent gale that swept out.

Ma Qing, Zhang Ying, and Fang Yan swiftly responded with their weapons, causing sparks to fly. When they looked at Lin Yun, they couldn’t contain the shock in their pupils, and they exclaimed, “Musician!”

Those who knew how to play the zither could only be considered as performers, and only those who had reached a certain attainment in the music dao could be considered as musicians.

It was hard to grasp music dao, to begin with. So it was even rarer that someone could become a musician with it. If a musician had a powerful musical instrument, the musical notes played by them would reach a terrifying height. Not only could they fight against multiple enemies, but they could also suppress those in the same cultivation.

Mo Ling’er was deeply shocked while being next to Lin Yun because she never expected this person to be a musician. In the Divine Dragon Era, a musician’s position was as noble and rare as a spiritualist.

But Lin Yun’s face was calm as his hands briefly paused. He said, “I can let you guys off if you leave now.”

“Ha. You’re just a musician, so where did you get your confidence from? If you don’t grasp the Saint Tone, you can’t do anything to me, even if you’re at the pinnacle of Noble Tone!” Ma Qing relied on his boundless dragon origin to resist the surrounding soundwaves. Since he was at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, he naturally had the confidence to say that.

“You know nothing about the music dao, and I don’t need to grasp the Saint Tone to defeat you.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed indifferently as the Golden Crow Saint Rune and Silver Phoenix Saint Rune within his profound palace bloomed simultaneously.

Raising one hand and pouring his soul energy into that hand, his fingers began to glow brightly. As lightning began to flicker and crackle on the zither, Lin Yun merely strummed it, and unleashed the lightning energy that was within the Thunderstorm Zither, “Lightning!”

A purple musical note instantly formed into a lightning sword and thrust towards Ma Qing. This was just the first musical note, and it had already forced Ma Qing to step back.

Lin Yun played nine musical notes, increasing the power each time. When the nine lightning notes overlapped, they broke through the dragon origin protecting Ma Qing, leaving a horrendous wound on his chest, and the lightning crackling on his injury made Ma Qing grimace with pain.

Mo Ling’er’s eyes were glued onto Lin Yun, and she was inwardly alarmed. What power! Even if Ma Qing wasn’t on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, he is still someone at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. But he is powerless before this person and suffered a severe injury so easily? Is this person a musician from the Divine Dragon Empire?

There was a high possibility that her speculation was true. After all, the Nirvana Banquet was starting soon, and musicians from all around Kunlun would be gathered. Simultaneously, this also meant that the person before her definitely had an extraordinary identity.

“Let’s go!” Ma Qing threw out blood. He knew that it was no longer possible for them to capture An Liuyan today.

“You guys want to leave now? Too late!” The lake’s surface broke apart, and a massive cauldron appeared. Beneath the cauldron, An Liuyan was like a mermaid that jumped out of the lake.

“The Heavenly Star Cauldron!” Fear finally appeared in the eyes of Ma Qing’s group, and they became nervous.
