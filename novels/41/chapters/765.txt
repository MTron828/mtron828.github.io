Chapter 766 - Undercurrent

Lin Yun closed his eyes and meditated on a lone mountain with the Flower Burial Sword a hundred meters away from him. The Draconic Banquet would start soon. After Lin Yun stabilized his movement technique, he began to observe the sky, moon, and clouds to temper his heart.

He was ultimately a swordsman. No matter how powerful the Azure Dragon Enneaform, Seven Slaughtering Fist, and Cloudsoaring Art was, he still had to rely on his sword if he wanted to shine brightly in the Draconic Banquet. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

After witnessing Yan Long’zi’s grace, Lin Yun realized the gap between him and the three kings and seven elites. His greatest strength was his spiritual sword intent. If he could push it to lesser mastery, his odds of winning would definitely be much greater.

The clouds before him were numerous like the ocean. But at a certain moment, dawn broke the horizon and cast a golden layer over the sea of clouds.

“Sword!” After the light shined on the sea of clouds, light radiated from the depth of Lin Yun’s pupils as he held onto the Flower Burial Sword. Then, he began to pour his sword intent into the sword, emitting a sharp ray that seemed like it could extinguish everything.

Lin Yun swung his sword out as a boundless sword ray pierced through the sea of clouds, reaching three thousand meters before it stopped. But the crack only lasted for a split second before it swiftly mended itself.

“I’m still at three thousand meters...it’s really hard to reach lesser mastery.” Lin Yun sheathed the Flower Burial Sword and sat down. Shaking his head, he continued to observe the scenery before him.

Time passed and Lin Yun ended up sitting without moving for five days. Morning dawned over the clouds again and dyed Lin Yun’s eyes golden as well. Suddenly, Lin Yun gained an insight. Spiritual sword intent was spiritual and invisible.

“I see, so my thoughts were wrong in the past. How can I cut the clouds with something meant for slicing physical objects? I was wrong right from the start…” Lin Yun instantly comprehended something and grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword once more.

This time, there were no tricks when Lin Yun swung his sword. He didn’t use any origin energy or strength with his slash, only pure sword intent. This attack was ordinary, but it was like it could destroy heaven earth as it caused a horrifying rip in the sky.

The power behind the sword was unimaginable as it gathered all the starlight shining down into a massive vortex. A brilliant sword ray was inside the vortex and began to circulate, emitting a terrifying aura that far exceeded Lin Yun’s sword aura from the past.

In the next moment, all of the clouds that spanned over ten thousand meters disappeared. Without clouds covering up the astral vortex, the brilliant golden radiance shined. At this moment, Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent has reached lesser mastery. Lin Yun sighed as he could now perform the Overlord Sword with spiritual sword intent.

Thunderbolt Slash! Solar Slash! Big Bang! Breaking Dawn! Blood Suppression! Tai’a Slash!

He swiftly executed all six forms. The sky turned dark and lightning rumbled through the horizon, which made the entire region look like an apocalypse. Then, Lin Yun used Supreme Dominance and perfectly combined the six forms.

“Great!” Lin Yun’s sword rumbled like lightning and made the surrounding mountains tremble. After he was satisfied with his new attack, he roared and sheathed his sword. With his spiritual sword intent at lesser mastery, he could smoothly execute the overlord sword when injected with spiritual sword intent.

As for Supreme Dominance, only Lin Yun knew how terrifying the combination of six forms was. This wasn’t his only trump card though. He also had Terranean Destruction, which had already reached the manifestation stage. With the Dustlight Sword Art and the Overlord Sword left behind by Jian Wuming, he could proudly stand at the peak of the entire Ancient Southern Domain.

But Lin Yun actually created two stronger attacks from those techniques, ensuring that he would shine brightly in the Draconic Banquet.

With the Draconic Banquet approaching, the entire Ancient Southern Domain was feeling anxious. Similar to Lin Yun, the others were also bitterly cultivating, hoping to shine brightly in the Draconic Banquet.

In a remote mountain range near Swordmire City, Wu Xiaotian sat on a rock as a crimson aura fluctuated around him. He was currently refining two monarch beast cores that were polluted with demonic aura. He refined the demonic aura from the beast cores, which made the crimson aura around him even denser.

After he refined the two beast cores, the crimson aura around him turned into a dense lump of blood. Then, the crimson aura began to blaze and turned into crimson flames that looked like liquid.

“I’ve finally reached the twelfth stage in the Crimsonflame Demonic Art.” Wu Xiaotian let out a breath without any excitement in his eyes. In recent years, no one had reached the twelfth stage, but Wu Xiaotian acted like it wasn’t a big deal.

Wu Xiaotian fought ferociously in the beast tide and obtained two monarch beast cores. When the beast tide came to an end, he stayed behind and went into seclusion in the Skymound Mountain Range. With this, he was able to reach the twelfth stage before the Draconic Banquet.

If the elders from his sect knew about this, they would certainly rejoice. After all, no one managed to reach the twelfth stage aside from their sect’s ancestors. In fact, most clutivators went insane upon reaching the tenth stage. Suddenly, Wu Xiaotian recalled Lin Yun who left before the final battle and surprised him.

But a brief moment later, Wu Xiaotian stopped thinking about Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun chose a path that was destined to fail. After Lin Yun left, many geniuses appeared and their heaven-defying talents made Wu Xiaotian feel a lot of pressure.

“This Draconic Banquet will be very exciting. Jian Ziye, don’t disappoint me!” Wu Xiaotian’s expression became cold as the crimson flames behind him began to wriggle violently. Then, they exploded and extinguished all life within a ten mile radius.

Located at the far north of the Ancient Southern Domain was the Northern Snow Manor. The Northern Snow Manor was ranked as one of the top three overlord forces and they had a deep foundation. They weren’t that much worse than the Indigomoon Elysium.

A blue-clothed middle-aged man was sitting on the throne of their manor. This man was the manor master. Behind the throne was an ice sword that was even colder than the surrounding temperature. In front of the man were many disciples who stood in the blizzard. One young man in particular was kneeling in front of the throne.

That young man looked about eighteen years old. He had strong cultivation that was already in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. Additionally, his sword intent was like a boundless ocean.

“Mu Han, your talent is the strongest in the path of sword among the disciples. I’ve groomed you for eighteen years without letting you out because I want you to shake the entire Ancient Southern Domain the moment you draw your sword.” The middle-aged man continued, “I want you to get into the top fifteen on this Draconic Banquet.”

“The top fifteen? My goal is to make it in the top ten. Otherwise, this would be meaningless.” The young man kneeling on the ground had a terrifyingly cold expression and tone.

Suddenly, a sword ray shot through the snowy mountains before landing in the manor. Everything that was in the path of the sword ray was frozen.

“Senior brother!”

“Senior brother is back!” All the disciples became excited when they saw this sword ray. Even Mu Han, who was kneeling on the ground, wore a serious expression.

As for the middle-aged man, he wore a faint smile. The newcomer was naturally Nangong Wanyu as he was the only one who would be called ‘senior brother’ by all of the disciples. With the Draconic Banquet approaching, all of the famous figures on the Dragoncloud Ranking were returning to their sect. WIth the return of Nangong Wanyu, the undercurrent sweeping through the Ancient Southern Domain was only beginning.
