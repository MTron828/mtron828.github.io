Chapter 1553 - Forest Encounter (1)

Lin Yun soared into the sky with his arms spread apart, wielding the Flower Burial Sword with his left hand. As he flew up the Celestial Observing Lake like a leaf, he instantly climbed a thousand feet.

When he was about to pass through the thick clouds and leave, he turned around to take one last look at the Celestial Observing Lake before leaving. But when he turned back, he saw a moon rising from the lake, which was purely condensed with sword intent.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

When the moon rose into the sky, it was accompanied by Azure Lotus Sword Flowers that were floating in the air like lamps. They looked like lanterns rising to the sky, looking serene and beautiful.

So this is that sword left behind by Yu Qingfeng three thousand years ago? There had always been a legend in the Sword Sect. Someone had seen a moon with tens of thousands of lanterns rising to the sky. When that person saw it, his attainment in the sword rapidly improved, and he couldn’t find it again, no matter how he tried.

But Lin Yun found it a pity because if he saw this scene when he was trying to grasp the fifth-grade sword intent, he might really be able to grasp it. Now that he had adjusted his mentality, this was nothing but a painting to him.

“Let’s come again next time.” Lin Yun entered the sea of clouds. He swiftly passed through the clouds and landed on the Celestial Observing Stage.

The sword box was still on the stage, and Lin Yun formed the Iris Saint Seal after verifying that no one was around. As ripples spread on the surface of the sword box, Lin Yun’s body gently swayed, then he entered the Iris Sacred Realm.

“The density of spiritual energy has increased…” Lin Yun instantly sensed the changes in the spiritual energy when he entered. In the past, the Iris Sacred Realm was like a wasteland without any signs of vitality. It looked like a plain that had flames raging through it.

He quickened his steps and came to the phoenix tree at the heart of the Iris Sacred Realm. The tree that was a sapling in the past had grown to a meter, shrouded in a faint green radiance.

Lil’ Purple was seated beside the tree, donned in a white dress. Paired with her flawless facial features and the gold-red mark on her forehead, it made her look noble and elegant.

But Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by her looks, but the aura that she was giving off. After absorbing all the True Dragon Saint Liquid, not only did it allow the phoenix tree to grow, but Lil’ Purple also recovered a lot of her strength. The aura she was giving off was close to the Dragon Pulse Realm. Since she was a phoenix, paired with her various means, no ordinary Dragon Pulse Realm expert could be her opponent.

“You’re here.” Lil’ Purple opened her eyes.

“You’re a lot stronger.” Lin Yun briefly examined her and continued, “You seem to have grown a little taller, too.”

“I’ve grown taller? Why can’t I feel it…?” Lil’ Purple rubbed her head. She looked at her dress and curled her lips in disdain, “No truth comes from the mouths of men. I didn’t grow tall at all, I’m still short.”

“Where’s Lil’ Red?” Lin Yun asked, changing the topic.

“It is basking in the lightning pool.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, and he rushed over. But when he saw the lightning pool more clearly, he was somewhat disappointed. He thought the lightning pool had been restored, but only a small portion was restored.

The saint aura and purity of the lightning pool still couldn’t be compared to the genuine one, and the depth could only reach his calf, at best. Lil’ Red could naturally bask in it, but Lin Yun could barely soak his legs in it.

Seeing Lin Yun’s arrival, Lil’ Red grinned before it charged out of the pool. When it came out of the lightning pool, it had lightning flickering from its body, and the lightning soon spread toward Lin Yun, causing his entire body and lips to twitch.

“Hahaha!” Lil’ Purple laughed when she flew over.

When Lil’ Red landed on the ground, it revealed a wronged and innocent expression.

“It… hurts…” Lin Yun’s cheek twitched after he recovered from the lightning.

“This much is accumulated after the Myriad Lightning Divine Rune rained down for three days and three nights. You previously used the Myriad Lightning Divine Rune to kill Ku Ying, so you now know how the Myriad Lightning Divine Rune feels like now.” Lil’ Purple smiled proudly.

Looking at Lil’ Purple rejoicing at his misfortune, Lin Yun glared at her before he squatted down to comfort Lil’ Red. He first ensured no lightning was flickering on its body before he caressed Lil’ Red’s head.

Carrying it to his embrace, Lin Yun stroked its fur with joy on his face. This was because the cat’s fur felt great and smooth.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun carried Lil’ Red and left the Iris Sacred Realm.

“Where are we going?”

“To the back mountains.”

A long mountain range outside the sect occupied half of the Ancient Barren Domain. The origin of that mountain range could trace back to ancient times. Most disciples of the Sword Sect and other powerful sects would often train in that mountain range.

Since the mountain range had survived through the ancient times, there were many secrets and forbidden grounds. Most disciples would choose to cultivate at the border of the mountain range because of how dangerous it was as one went deeper into the mountain range.

After all, if they entered a forbidden ground by mistake, even Samsara Edict Realm experts would have difficulty coming out alive. Not to mention that the mountain range was enveloped in a poisonous grey miasma and enveloped the entrance deep into the mountain.

The poisonous miasma was extremely terrifying, and no Elysium Core Realm dared to be careless. Since Lin Yun came to the mountain range once in the past, he retraced the path he once took and entered the border of the mountain range without any trouble.

Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, Carefree 9 Swords, Flicking Divine Finger, and the Blue Dragon Bone. Lin Yun’s strength had undergone a drastic transformation. So he naturally needed to temper himself through battle.

The Heavenly Pool Gathering involved the eight powerful sects. If he joined the gathering, he would definitely be the center of attention. After all, he couldn’t keep a low profile, even if he wanted to with his identity as the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. After all, he wouldn’t only be embarrassing himself but his master as well if he lost.

After arriving at his destination, Lin Yun walked into the mountain range, carrying the sword box behind him and Lil’ Red in his embrace. In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun had been in the mountain range for half a month.
