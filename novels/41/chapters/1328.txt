Chapter 1329 - Kneel!

Nangong Ze, Ning Feng, and Zhang Jin have clearly engraved an origin saint rune on their elysium cores just from the ancient and sacred lights that they were emitting. Dugu Yan probably didn’t refine an origin saint rune, but everyone could feel a lethal threat coming from his shut eyes.

There were rumors that he had refined an Azure Thunder Sacred Flame in the Profound Wither Island, bringing his Azure Thunder Sword Eyes to an even higher level. So they had a feeling that if Dugu Yan opens his eyes, something terrifying would definitely happen.

Just one of them was enough to suppress the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, so everyone didn’t think that there was a need for the four of them to join hands to deal with Lin Yun.

“Impressive. You’re not afraid even if the four of us joined hands. We have no intention of making you an enemy, and we can let you go as long as you hand the Quasi-Saint Origin and Dragon Saint Pellet over. We’re fated transcendents, and it’ll be rude for you not to give us any respect.” Ning Feng said. His eyes were squinted, and he was also wearing a smile that made him look amicable.

“So? Who the hell do you think you are? Why do I have to give someone like you my respect?” Lin Yun replied with a playful yet casual smile.

His words instantly made the surroundings fall into a deadly silence with everyone’s attention focused on Lin Yun. They were shocked, but they soon figured it out. After all, it would be weird if Flower Burial wasn’t arrogant.

Then again, they didn’t think that Lin Yun could change the outcome even if he was arrogant. If he wasn’t willing to lower his head, then he could only face death.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Ning Feng’s eyes flashed with a cold light but his smile became even denser. But looking at his smile, everyone could feel a chill tingling down their spines.

“Looks like I have to teach you some rules. This is the Kunlun Realm, and you will only die if you’re not willing to lower your head!” In the next second, his saint armor emitted a dazzling golden light that felt ancient and deadly. As war drums resounded, Ning Feng raised his hand and his palm began to flicker with purple light. When it descended, it even left fine cracks in the surrounding space.

“That’s…the Heaven Crippling Palm!” Ning Feng’s attack drew a wave of exclamations from the surroundings. After all, the Heaven Crippling Palm was a secret technique of the Emerald Jade Manor, and only geniuses with extraordinary talents could practice it.

Furthermore, it wasn’t easy to execute because it had to exhaust a large amount of astral energy. At the same time, one had to reach a high stage in the Divine Phaseless Art. There were rumors that if someone managed to learn this move successfully, they could shatter even saint artifacts with a palm.

As everyone was feeling shocked by the power of the Heaven Crippling Hand, Ning Feng’s smile grew even denser. He was planning to crush Lin Yun into minced meat with this attack. Even Nangong Ze and the rest were just standing to the side, watching with smiles because Lin Yun was as arrogant as rumored.

But it was a pity that he ran into someone tougher. Ning Feng wasn’t the strongest amongst them, but with his saint armor, he wouldn’t even be afraid if he had to face Qin Cang. So in their eyes, Lin Yun was merely courting death.

Right at that moment, a golden ray streaked across the sky and a sword ray flew out, accompanied by a dragon roar. Everyone could only see a golden flash before an earth-shattering explosion resounded that made everyone’s eardrums tremble.

When everything settled down, they could see a purple snow flower hovering in the air. It was Ye Ziling who had purple lightning flickering on the surface of her body as she stood in the blizzard. At the same time, she also had a divine dragon coiling around her, and she had the Radiant Snow Flower blooming within her pupils.

“Fated transcendent!”

“Isn’t she Ye Ziling, the beauty of the Profound Azure Prefecture…?” Everyone exclaimed when they sensed the aura that Ye Ziling was givng off. But how was that possible? They couldn’t figure out how the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was able to give birth to a fated transcendent when they shouldn’t even produce a transcendent.

This had overthrown everyone’s understanding, not to mention that the temperament that she was giving off was also extraordinary.

“What’s going on?” The faces of Nangong Ze, Zhang Jin, and Dugu Yan changed. Especially Nangong Ze and Zhang Jin, who had envy in their eyes when they looked at Lin Yun. Not only the three of them, but everyone, including the fated transcendents from the other powerful sects, also had a change on their faces.

Ning Feng, who was sent flying away, had blood dripping down from his lips as he looked at Ye Ziling with deep shock reflected in his pupils.

“You want to bully my junior brother? Did you ask me for my opinion?” Ye Ziling said with her eyes flashing coldly.

But Ning Feng wasn’t too bothered about it. Wiping the blood off his lips, he smiled, “Miss, you’re really ruthless. But I have no habit of beating up a woman, so you better stand aside.”

“Who the hell do you think you are?” Ye Ziling raged when she heard that, feeling that Ning Feng had a prejudice against women. “You think that women are mere pets that you can beat if you want?”

Ning Feng became awkward when he heard that. He was blessed with good looks and an extraordinary origin. No matter how he looked at it, he should be stronger than Lin Yun. But he never expected that Ye Ziling didn’t give him any face.

But before he could become angry, Ye Ziling had already charged over. At the same time, one azure bird after another flew from her body as she unleashed the sword aura of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords.

With the divine dragon enveloping her, her sword aura was like fleeting clouds that came crashing down on Ning Feng.

When Nangong Ze looked at this scene, he was inwardly rejoicing that he wasn’t the first to attack. Otherwise, it would be embarrassing if he couldn’t deal with Ye Ziling. So he smiled, “Ning Feng, don’t tell me you can’t deal with a woman. As of now, let me have some fun with Lin Yun!”

When he laughed, he took a step forth as a boundless blade aura began to gather together like clouds. It only took one step to appear before Lin Yun, and he was so confident that he didn’t even draw his sword and merely used his palm against him.

His palm might seem simple, but it was profound and contained boundless blade rays. His blade rays weren’t only sharp, but also dazzling and could pierce through the void. But before his palm could land on Lin Yun, he was suddenly sent flying away with a palm mark left on his chest. Cracks also began to appear on his blade aura, and when he landed on the ground, he took several steps back to neutralize the force.

“Who allowed you to make a move?” A cold voice resounded. When Nangong Ze raised his head, he saw a white-clothed woman with a veil covering her face. She was also emitting the aura of an emperor, as if everything had to bow before her, including his blade intent.

“H-H-How is this possible…” Nangong Ze muttered to himself. With a slight change on his face, he quickly reached out for the blade he carried behind him. But before he could even touch the blade hilt, a bamboo conical hat flew over. When the bamboo hat flew over, the space around the hat began to violently tremble.

If he insisted on drawing his blade, then he would be struck by this attack. Otherwise, he could only bring out his constellation. But since they were just probing each other, Nangong Ze’s pride couldn’t allow him to bring out his constellation.

Cursing inwardly, Nangong Ze had no choice but to give up grabbing his blade and pushed his hands out. When his hands clashed with the bamboo conical hat, the bamboo conical hat exploded, and Nangong Ze was forced to take several steps back with a trace of blood dripping from his lips. Evidently, he suffered a little loss in the confrontation.

“Who allowed you to bully him?” Su Ziyao’s voice resounded once more. When she removed her bamboo conical hat, her beauty had left many people breath taken. Ye Ziling was already beautiful, and Su Ziyao wasn’t inferior to her.

“Fated transcendent!”

“Another fated transcendent!” Everyone present was completely dumbfounded with disbelief in their eyes. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had another fated transcendent? Just what kind of monstrous sect was that?

Nangong Ze’s lips twitched as his face changed because his instincts were telling him that this woman was even more terrifying than Ning Feng.

With a wave of her hand, an ancient zither appeared in Su Ziyao’s hands. But just when everyone was thinking that she was about to play it, she suddenly destroyed the zither and revealed a saint sword. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

When Su Ziyao grabbed onto the saint sword, Nangong Ze could feel goosebumps rising on his skin and quickly retreated because that was what his instincts were telling him. As he retreated, he grabbed onto his blade and drew it out. When the blade and sword clashed, the two of them were so fast that everyone in the surroundings had difficulty catching up with them.

“Brat, looks like your luck is pretty good when it comes to women.” Zhang Jin looked at Lin Yun with envy in his eyes before he mocked, “Anyone else?”

“Well, I still have a cat,” smiled Lin Yun.

When Lil’ Red stood up on Lin Yun’s shoulder, it let out a roar at Zhang Jin. But Lil’ Red in its cat form was small, and it didn’t look ferocious at all.

“Are you messing with m…” The corner of Zhang Jin’s lips twitched as he snorted. But before he could finish his sentence, Lil’ Red had already jumped off Lin Yun’s shoulder. When it reappeared before Zhang Jin once more, it had already taken on the Ancient Dracoape form with its massive figure emitting an ancient ferocity.

This made Zhang Jin briefly stunned with his jaw dropped. But taking this opportunity, Lil’ Red swung its claw at Zhang Jin with the Divine Saint Rune blooming in its palm, emitting an ancient aura with demonic light flickering on it that left everyone stumped once more.

They instantly recognized that it was another fated transcendent, a cat that was comparable to a fated transcendent!

This instantly made countless people exclaim with their faces distorted because they couldn’t figure out what was going on. Just like that, Dugu Yan was the only one left out of the four transcendent geniuses.

“Kneel!” Dugu Yan suddenly barked and opened his eyes, unleashing the Azure Thunder Sword Eyes. This instantly made everyone’s faces change before they began to distance themselves from him. This was too unexpected, and Dugu Yan didn’t give any warning before unleashing the Azure Thunder Sword Eyes.
