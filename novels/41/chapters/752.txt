Chapter 753 - We’re Not The Same

The sky was dark as Lin Yun and Wu Xiaotian stood against each other. Are they going to spar here?

Ji Wuye was shocked as he never expected that his senior brother would pay such attention to Lin Yun to the point where he would want to spar with the latter. After all, Lin Yun was just a newly risen talent. So what if he could kill an overlord quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm expert?

His senior brother was someone who could heavily injure an overlord demonic beast with an attack, and his senior brother even wanted to kill the beast king. No matter how he looked at it, his senior brother and Lin Yun weren’t on the same level.

With great doubt, Ji Wuye quietly backed off and watched them. Wu Xiaotian wore a casual smile on his face. He might’ve suggested a spar with Lin Yun, but he didn’t place it in his heart. His muscles were loose and he was full of openings.

But Lin Yun didn’t move. He held onto the Flower Burial Sword with sword intent accumulating in his pupils. This look gave others a deep and unfathomable feeling.

Gradually, Wu Xiaotian retracted his smile as his aura became even more refined. The reason why he looked like he had many openings was because he was leaving a trap for Lin Yun on purpose.

“They’re still not moving?” Ji Wuye’s eyes flashed with impatience as he was tired of waiting. They were only going to spar, so was there a need for them to be this serious? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But right at this moment, Ji Wuye’s eyes suddenly flashed. A resounding sword hum filled the air and before he knew it, lightning rumbled through the sky. This caused the sky to light up. At the same time, nine crimson pythons roared while a crimson sea appeared behind Wu Xiaotian.

When Lin Yun and Wu Xiaotian clashed, a brilliant sword ray collided with the nine crimson pythons. In that split second, two terrifying auras clashed before soaring into the sky and creating a huge hole in the sky. Sunlight peeked through the temporary hole and shined onto Lin Yun and Wu Xiaotian. Now, anyone would be able to see their fair even if they were a thousand miles away.

Ji Wuye’s mouth dropped in disbelief as the scene of Lin Yun’s hair fluttering in the sky and Wu Xiaotian’s enraged face was deeply imprinted in his mind. But in reality, Lin Yun and Wu Xiaotian’s fight was fast.

Their spar ended in a split second as blood dripped from Lin Yun’s lips. He was sent flying one hundred miles while Wu Xiaotian merely lowered his right hand without any changes on his face.

Their fight attracted everyone’s attention, but they saw nothing when they turned back because the hole in the demonic cloud closed up and darkness descended onto the city once more.

“You lost,” said Wu Xiaotian with a smile.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips as he replied, “Don’t be so sure.”

Wounds appeared on Wu Xiaotian’s right hand as blood began to drip down. This made Wu Xiaotian’s face dark for a long time before he looked at Lin Yun again, “Your sword intent is formidable, but your path is wrong. You know what I mean.”

Lin Yun didn’t deny nor agree as he fell into silence.

“What’s the matter? Am I wrong?” asked Wu Xiaotian. “In the entire Ancient Southern Domain...no, the entire Profound Amber Realm. No one has managed to grasp the spiritual sword intent before reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm. Even among those in the Heavenly Soul Realm, there aren’t many who grasped the spiritual sword intent before reaching the seventh soul. Even Nangong Wanyu, whose talent isn’t inferior to yours, has chosen another path.”

“You have already lost your ambition after losing to Jiang Ziye. You haven’t even been able to walk out of the shadow of the three kings and seven elites because of your fear. But I’m not the same as you,” said Lin Yun before he cupped his hands together and left.

Wu Xiaotian’s face was ugly when he heard Lin Yun’s words because they had a huge impact on him.

“Isn’t he a little too arrogant?” Ji Wuye said as he approached Wu Xiaotian. After all, Lin Yun had the disadvantage compared to his senior brother. He knew that his senior brother had suppressed his cultivation and didn’t use his trump cards.

Wu Xiaotian waved his hand and said, “You can’t say that. He does have the qualification to be proud. But he’s nothing to be concerned with during the Draconic Banquet. Trying to comprehend the spiritual sword intent before twenty is too hard…”

“How hard exactly?” asked Ji Wuye.

“It’s a hundred times harder than me killing a beast king. He’s imprisoning himself and he will soon pay the price,” said Wu Xiaotian as he had keenly sensed Lin Yun’s ambition, which he wasn’t optimistic about. This was why he said that Lin Yun wouldn’t be a threat during the Draconic Banquet.

Not the same? Wu Xiaotian looked at Lin Yun’s figure and snorted. They were indeed not the same. He had the qualification to challenge the three kings and seven elites, but Lin Yun did not have that qualification. So, how could they be the same?

Ten days later, at the Falling Dragon Slope, Lin Yun returned to where the sword hovered in the sky and was shrouded in lightning. The boundless sword intent dazzled brightly, but Lin Yun couldn’t comprehend it at all. The sword intent had condensed into a sword, containing the immortal sword intent of a swordsman even after a thousand years had passed.

“It’s too grand.” Lin Yun was filled with emotions and he couldn’t describe his shock with words. It was too strong and Lin Yun felt as though the sword hovering in the sky was the lord of this region. If anyone dared to be disrespectful, they would be met with disaster.

Wu Xiaotian said that his path wouldn’t work, but he didn’t know that Lin Yun’s sword intent was already at the quasi-spiritual sword intent. Just that fact alone allowed him to overlook everyone in the Profound Amber Realm.

Although the half step wasn’t easy to take, it was just a matter of time. Perhaps it would take a year or maybe a day, but it was just a matter of time. As for Wu Xiaotian, he was scared out of his wits by the three kings and seven elites, and that fear was deeply planted in his heart. If he couldn’t face his fear, then he would still lose at the hands of the three kings and seven elites.

So Lin Yun wasn’t joking when he said that he was different from Wu Xiaotian. Tapping his foot on the ground, Lin Yun landed at the foot of Falling Dragon Slope. The sword aura was right in front of him and he didn’t dare to approach carelessly. The place he stood was where the Imperial Sword Herb once was.

“I wonder who left this sword intent behind.” Lin Yun raised his head and looked at that sword. Then, he pushed his sword intent to the limit and examined it carefully.

Hmmm? Lin Yun’s face changed because the sword suddenly moved. He saw a wisp of sword ray dissipating and fusing with heaven and earth, creating a storm as clouds began to roll violently.

This is… It was xiantian sword intent, which left him shocked. He never expected that the sword above the mountain would show him scenes of the xiantian sword intent reaching the limit. Suddenly, the scenes changed as tens of thousands of sword rays shot across the horizon. Each sword rays could tear the sky apart.

After the sky was torn apart, hundreds of stars began to fall with every strand of starlight looking eternal. As the sword intent became stronger, the rip in the sky grew larger as the stars increased from one hundred to one thousand, two thousand...eight thousand, and finally nine thousand!

The scene was too shocking as nine thousand stars were scattered on the ground, creating a glorious scene. This was spiritual sword intent. Lin Yun was greatly shocked, but he instantly recovered. The scene detailed the transformation of xiantian sword intent to spiritual sword intent.

When the spiritual sword intent reached the limit, the nine thousand stars formed nine revolving star vortexes with each vortex reaching the size of a thousand meters. They were so large that they could easily suppress the sky. Lin Yun felt like he could touch them just by stretching out his hand.

Then, the nine vortexes disappeared at the same time as the sky plunged into eternal darkness with the sword hovering alongside the sun and moon. Is that the sword intent that transcends spiritual sword intent?

But before Lin Yun could think more about it, his eyes began to hurt and blood dripped down from his eyes as his vision turned black. After a brief moment of panic, Lin Yun’s heart gradually calmed down. This should be the senior warning him that his sword intent wasn’t enough. After all, his sword intent was only at the level of quasi-spiritual sword intent.

Night descended as Lin Yun sat with his legs crossed while fireflies buzzed around him. Many powerful demonic beasts from Flamedragon Hill watched this bizarre scene. Some of them wanted to take a look, but they instantly lost their courage the moment they thought of the sword hovering above the hill.

One night passed in the blink of an eye when finally Lin Yun opened his eyes. He had already recovered from his injuries, but the fireflies around him didn’t dissipate. Lin Yun instantly noticed this and began to wonder if his sword intent had remained for an entire night.

Although this was nothing compared to the sword intent in the Flamedragon Hill, it was a great surprise to him. As he gently touched them, the fireflies dispersed and dissipated.

“Thank you, senior.” Lin Yun bowed towards the Falling Dragon Slope. The senior who left behind this strand of sword intent might have left or died, but Lin Yun believed that his will still exist. After all, Murong Qing and the others used it to defeat the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

When Lin Yun raised his head again, his pupils flashed with a strand of pride that lit up the sky. Who says that no one could comprehend the spiritual sword intent beneath the Heavenly Soul Realm? Who says that this path is impossible? I, Lin Yun, refuse to accept it!
