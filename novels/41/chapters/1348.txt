Chapter 1350 - Brewing Soup With Golden Dragon Bones

When the pair of wings unfolded behind Lin Yun, a complete origin saint rune also entered the golden pellet in his violet palace. In the next second, the golden pellet began to shine brightly. As the golden pellet revolved, it began to grow in size little by little, and all the boundless astral energy in his violet palace also shrank into droplets of golden liquid.

Just like that, golden rain drizzled down in his violet palace and instantly formed into an ocean beneath the Divine Astral Flower. When his astral energy began to manifest into a golden ocean, the golden pellet above the Divine Astral Flower transformed into a core and Lin Yun had finally reached the Elysium Core Realm.

In the Empyrean Realm, the origin energy would turn into liquid when it transformed into astral energy. It was the same process, it’s just that the liquid was gold. The golden ocean looked like a huge patch of golden barren land and looked like it was eternal, without a single ripple on the surface. In reality, it was impossible to shake, and it was tough to even create a ripple.

This was the difference between the Elysium Core Realm and the Empyrean Realm. After reaching the Elysium Core Realm, one’s astral energy would undergo a transformation and become even more condensed. The elysium core hovering above was like a mountain suppressing the whole ocean, and only the elysium core could move this golden ocean manifested with astral energy.

The size of the ocean for ordinary Elysium Core Realm cultivators would only be ten feet at most, and a hundred feet for geniuses. Only transcendents could exceed over a hundred feet, but three or four hundred feet would be their limit. Not many people could be like Lin Yun, who reached a thousand feet the moment he reached the Elysium Core Realm.

The size of the ocean meant that the amount of astral energy he could contain was a lot higher than other Elysium Core Realm experts, and this meant that he would be able to last longer in battle, unleashing more powerful moves during the battle.

Lin Yun was happy. His mind sank into the elysium core on the Divine Astral Flower. The elysium core wasn’t huge and was the size of half an infant’s fist. On the surface of the elysium core, there was a silver saint rune. When the light shone brightly, a dazzling light emitted from the elysium core. That was roughly the effect that came from the Golden Crow Saint Rune.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his gaze fell onto Lil’ Purple and squeezed out a smile. “Empress, I’ve succeeded!”

“Hmph, not bad,” replied Lil’ Purple.

With a single thought, a pair of golden wings unfolded behind him, causing the surrounding space to distort. In the next second, he had already appeared behind Lil’ Purple.

“So fast!” Lil’ Purple was shocked because the Divine Sunchasing Art was a famous movement technique in the Ancient Era. The higher one’s cultivation, the more powerful it would be. As the pair of Golden Crow Wings folded before him, it formed into a barrier and sparks flew when they clashed together.

Every single feather was comparable to a saint artifact, sharp and enveloped in ancient sacred light. When Lil’ Purple saw this, it made Lin Yun look like an ancient deity, extraordinary and majestic.

Stowing the Golden Crow Wings back into his body, Lin Yun was inwardly excited because the pair of wings were too powerful. Furthermore, he could control them like his arms. It was completely different from how he manifested a pair of wings with his astral energy in the past.

“You don’t seem emotional at all,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Hmph!” Lil’ Purple snorted. She naturally wouldn’t say how nervous she was earlier.

“Can I practice the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon now?” If Lin Yun remembered correctly, Lil’ Purple said he could start cultivating it after reaching the Elysium Core Realm.

The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon was divided into the Divine Dragon Sword Score, Godly Phoenix Sword Score, and the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Score. Lin Yun had grasped the Dancing Indigo Phoenix song from the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Score, and he was only lacking in the realm.

Now that he had reached the Elysium Core Realm, nothing could stop him. Truth be told, the Iris Sword Sutra was already lacking behind when he reached the Empyrean Realm.

“Sure, but this place doesn’t look like it will last much longer,” said Lil’ Purple while she looked around.

“How long will this place last?” Lin Yun quickly asked. This place was simply a holy land because the flow of time was different. So he naturally wanted to make use of it as much as possible.

“Roughly half a month, I guess?” Lil’ Purple counted with her fingers before scratching her head, “This empress doesn’t know about the exact time.”

Half a month should be enough… Lin Yun pondered before his gaze fell onto Su Ziyao and the rest, “Why aren’t they awake? They’re fine, right?”

“They’re great,” said Lil’ Purple. “When the herbal field was destroyed earlier, they had devoured half of the remaining essence. The old geezer was kind and even used Life-Death Sacred Light to protect them even though he wasn’t able to remain for much longer. He ensured that they wouldn’t be blown apart from the immense herbal essences in their bodies.”

“That’s good, then.” Lin Yun glanced and saw that Lil’ Red was amongst them, standing on one foot, looking pretty adorable. But since this had involved the Profound Wither Great Saint, this stirred Lin Yun’s emotions once more. A person who was dying persuaded him not to be sad, and he had felt too much warmth from the Profound Wither Great Saint.

“Senior Sister Ye seems to be different now…” Lin Yun was surprised as he looked at Ye Ziling. Ye Ziling had snow flowers dancing around her, and each flower contained a terrifying power. Furthermore, she also had lightning flickering across her body that looked like a divine dragon.

The most bizarre thing was that as the divine dragon moved, the surrounding snow flowers seems to sway with it. The two had reached a bizarre balance, as if they were one entity right from the start. At the same time, Ye Ziling was emitting an invisible sword aura that even made Lin Yun shocked. It was something that had far exceeded the limit of sky sword intent.

“This is her fortune,” said Lil’ Purple.

After a brief pondering, Lin Yun withdrew his gaze. “Earlier, when I was sealing the Great Saint Origin, I seem to…”

But before he could finish, Lil’ Purple threw him a gaze that meant that he had to stop asking. As the two had a great rapport, Lin Yun naturally swallowed the words that he was about to say. It looked like someone had really come. The Profound Wither Great Saint didn’t say who it was and Lil’ Purple didn’t dare to tell him. This couldn’t help making Lin Yun curious about who it was.

Although he was curious, he naturally couldn’t guess who it was, even if he managed to break his head thinking about it. He would definitely not be able to connect it with Yu Qingfeng.

“Lend the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute to this empress.” Lil’ Purple asked for the flute and continued, “We don’t have much time left. We only have fifteen days, and time is too short for you to learn the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. So let me help you.”

Not long later, flute music resounded as Lil’ Purple blew the flute while sitting on the Snow Heed Blade. As her hair began to scatter about, it became snow white with her eyes flickering, making her look like a goddess as she emitted an ethereal temperament.

As the music resounded, Lin Yun could hear the immense dao that was contained within the music. Lin Yun quickly sat down and took out nine saint elixirs, allowing them to hover around him. As the flute music resounded, Lin Yun’s mind soon sank into it and was shocked to discover that the music could guide the circulation of his astral energy. At the same time, the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Score that was hard to comprehend earlier suddenly became easy for him.

Suddenly, Lin Yun opened his eyes and saw the golden and crimson runes on his forehead glowing. At this moment, he knew that Lil’ Purple had activated the two origin divine runes, and he knew that there was a cost for her to do it.

As Lil’ Purple raised her head, she bumped gazes with Lin Yun. At this moment, they merely conversed through their eyes, and they understood what the other was trying to say.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun closed his eyes and began to circulate the Divine Dragon Sword Score and Godly Phoenix Sword Score. As ripples spread out over the golden ocean, his boundless astral energy began to course through his veins in a complex pattern, following the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Score.

Many meridians that he didn’t pay attention to were opened by his astral energy. Three days later, Lin Yun practically consumed one saint elixir a day while practicing the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Sutra, gradually allowing him to go on the right path.

At the same time, a golden mist began to emit from his body that manifested into a dragon and a phoenix. As they intertwined, they formed into a boundless sword aura.

Just like that, ten days had passed in the blink of an eye. Lin Yun had already consumed all nine saint elixirs and had no choice but to use the Dragon Origin Pellet that was given to him by Feng Jue. At the same time, he had also exhausted nearly all his Divine Astral Pellets and True Dragon Saint Liquid to bring the Divine Dragon Sword Score and Godly Phoenix Sword Score to the first level.

Although he had only reached the initial phase and still needed an astronomical sum of resources to reach the complete first level, the outlines of a Divine Dragon and a Godly Phoenix had gradually formed above the golden ocean. Aside from that, there was also a faint golden mist above the golden ocean.

The astral energy contained within the mist was terrifying. At the very least, it had reached a height that shocked Lin Yun. This was the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura? In just thirteen days, Lin Yun had circulated 108 cycles of the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Score. Many times, the Divine Dragon and Godly Phoenix shattered into pieces, but he ultimately succeeded.

Not only did he have to exhaust all his mental energy, but he also needed to bear great pain after going through so many cycles. But even so, he still lacked one last step, which was to fuse the Divine Dragon and Godly Phoenix together. But he had already reached his limit after he had already exhausted all his resources.

A long time later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and flicked his finger, filling his entire body with the golden mist before it gathered on his fingertip. As a sword aura exploded from his body, a sword vibration made all of heaven and earth tremble. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

When he shot a powerful sword ray from his finger, it instantly tore the space ahead of him apart. The space ahead was like an iceberg with cracks spreading out, torn apart by the sword aura.

“The Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura…” Lin Yun muttered and was shocked. He had yet to fully succeed in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, and the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura manifested by his astral energy was pitifully small. But even so, the terrifying power was shocking.

When the flute music stopped, Lin Yun’s mind sank and the Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him. With a flash, he grabbed Lil’ Purple, who fell from the Snow Heed Blade, into his embrace. Looking at her pale face, Lin Yun couldn’t blame her at all because she did it all for him.

“Don’t do this again in the future,” said Lin Yun while feeling his heart aching.

“What if I do this again?” Lil’ Purple refuted.

“Didn’t we come to an agreement that you’re not allowed to use the divine runes again? You promised me!” Lin Yun questioned in a solemn tone.

“Yes, this empress promised you!” Lil’ Purple’s face was pale as she gritted her teeth, “But so what? Everyone says that you’ll be killed by Qin Cang, so do you want me to see you being killed by them? Do you think you’re really strong? You have no idea how strong Qin Cang is because he has cultivated the Golden Dragon Aura. I just didn’t tell you how strong he is!”

Lin Yun was stumped when he heard that because he really didn’t know.

“You’re the first person this empress saw after a hundred thousand years, and you promised that the three of us will always be together…” Lil’ Purple’s eyes welled up in tears as her face became even paler. Her voice began to sob while she continued, “What if he really kills you? What should this empress do? You’re not allowed to blame me because I will do it again in the future!”

Lil’ Purple might seem like she never takes things seriously, likes to boast, and is vicious with her words, but she wouldn’t listen to anyone when she becomes stubborn.

Hearing what Lil’ Purple said, Lin Yun was speechless and had no idea what to say. What did he do that he deserves a phoenix to cry for him? At the same time, he made a promise to himself that he would not let Lil’ Purple suffer any grievance in the future. If anyone wanted to harm her, then they would have to pass through his corpse.

“What’s going on? What happened earlier?” Jiang Lichen was the first to recover from the restriction. As he rubbed his neck, he could feel a sore ache coming from his neck that made his entire body stiff.

“Go back and rest,” said Lin Yun.

“Okay.” Lil’ Purple nodded as she returned to the sword box.
