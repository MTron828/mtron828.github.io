Chapter 1592 - My Life In My Hands!

Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple were simultaneously curious and surprised. Regardless of whether it was Lin Yun’s sword intent or Lil’ Purple’s innate senses, they would be able to detect it if someone got close to them within a hundred miles.

If they couldn’t detect anyone, that would only mean on of two things. One was either this person had an aura concealing secret technique like the Black Tortoise Breathing, or this person was stronger than Lin Yun. If it was the latter, this person should be a saint, at the very least.

“Senior, spare my life!” Chang Yu continued to kowtow with his forehead covered in blood, showing no signs of stopping his kowtow.

Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple got close to each other while they felt an immense pressure. Just when the two felt uneasy, a person walked out from the woods. It was a grey-robed elder.

When Lin Yun looked at this old man, he immediately felt immense pressure. This person didn’t have any aura, as though he didn’t have any cultivation… more accurately, his signs of life were practically nonexistent.

This person was standing there, and yet he would feel that this person was nonexistent if he didn’t see this person himself. On the other hand, surprise flashed across Lil’ Purple’s pupils, as though she had discovered something.

“Senior, spare my life…” Chang Yu became even more afraid, but the old man couldn’t be bothered with him and waved his hand in Chang Yu’s direction.

An invisible force descended and wrapped around Chang Yu. As that invisible force began to refine Chang Yu, this made him let out a miserable cry.

This made the corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitch because he could sense that the old man was refining Chang Yu like he was refining a pellet. As Chang Yu screamed in pain, his body began to shrink and was turned into a crimson pellet that fell into Lin Yun’s hand.

The crimson pellet was emitting a powerful aura, and no one would think that this pellet was refined by using the body of a Dragon Pulse Realm genius. Lin Yun’s face changed because he had never seen anything like this before. Judging from Chang Yu’s reaction, could it be that he had recognized this person's origin?

The grey-robed elder appeared before Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple in the next moment with a smile, “You guys don’t have to be nervous, and I already know what happened. You’re the ones who saved my grandson.”

Grandson? Lin Yun was briefly stumped upon hearing that.

“Your grandson fooled us!” Lil’ Purple said indifferently.

Lin Yun was shocked upon hearing that because this old man turned out to be the grandfather of that Heavenly Profound Tortoise!

This meant that he was an old… a Heavenly Profound Tortoise at the pinnacle, which meant that this old man should be a Saint.

As the old man furrowed his brows in confusion, Lil’ Purple told him what had happened.

After hearing the entire story, the grey-robed old man laughed before speaking in an ashamed tone, “Hahaha, that’s easy. My lineage provoked a powerful enemy, and many descendants are left outside by us. We failed to find many of our descendants when we resolved our enemy. I only knew this little fellow was here when his life was in danger. It’s young and ignorant, and it’s probably afraid. I can give you the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood you need.”

Lin Yun cupped his hands together, “Thank you, Senior.”

“Interesting. With your accumulated foundation, you might really not be able to succeed in your tribulation with the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood. How about this? I’ll give you another droplet.” The grey-robed elder said, condensing two golden droplets of Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood.

As the saint blood radiated brightly, the power contained within was terrifying, enveloping it in an extremely ancient aura. Lin Yun smiled at the two droplets of blood, “Senior, can you give me another droplet? I can exchange it with treasures.”

“There’s no need. Just tell me what you need it for. I don’t mind giving it to you, but you can’t give it to anyone else.” The old man briefly paused, then smiled, “A droplet of Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood requires a hundred years to accumulate.”

Lin Yun understood that the old man was hinting that the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood was a precious and priceless treasure. But the old man wouldn’t mind giving him another drop because of the little Heavenly Profound Tortoise, and his politeness made Lin Yun feel somewhat uncomfortable.

“Uhh… I have a tortoise shell that you should see.” Lin Yun briefly pondered before retrieving the tortoise shell with the Divine Tortoise Transformation recorded on it.

The grey-robed old man briefly observed the tortoise shell before his face changed. He then raised his head to look at Lin Yun, “You’ve already learned the Black Tortoise Breathing?”

“Yeah.”

“How many days did you take?”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“One day, just a few attempts.” Lin Yun replied. He didn’t say that he learned it with one attempt.

“Several attempts?” The grey-robed elder was stumped, looking at Lin Yun with disbelief before he turned to look at Lil’ Purple. He believed Lil’ Purple’s words more.

“This fellow might be unreliable, but he doesn’t lie. If he said he learned it after several attempts, then he learned it after several attempts.” Lil’ Purple replied.

Hearing that, the grey-robed elder’s face became solemn while looking at Lin Yun, “Since Lord Phoenix said so, it should be true, then. If you’re interested in the next portion of this tortoise shell, you can come and look for me in the future.”

“Senior, how can I address you?”

“Address? Others call me the Black Turtle Ancestor. I can tell you that the next portion of this tortoise shell is related to the Black Tortoise’s inheritance.” The grey-robed elder said with a solemn expression.

The grey-robed elder gave another Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood to Lin Yun, making three droplets. A commotion came from the Cold Pond and the Heavenly Profound Tortoise appeared from the pond's surface.

When he looked at the grey-robed elder, he could feel a familiar aura from the old man. He briefly hesitated before he asked, “Grandfather?”

“You silly child.” The Black Turtle Ancestor wore an amicable expression and was happy seeing his grandson. This was a surprise to him because many descendants of their lineage had died. He was often too late when he sensed that his descendant was in danger, and it was the same this time. If it weren’t for Lin Yun, this Heavenly Profound Tortoise would’ve died.

Once again, the Black Turtle Ancestor expressed his gratitude to Lin Yun. But Lin Yun was embarrassed because he was also after the Heavenly Profound Tortoise’s Saint Blood.

“I don’t need to know what you think; I only need to know what you’ve done.” The Black Turtle Ancestor shook his head.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts upon hearing that. He watched as the Black Turtle Ancestor left with the Heavenly Profound Tortoise.

A brief moment later, Lil’ Purple retrieved the ominous ice aura from the Cold Pond. He had over-fulfilled his objective. The four ominous auras he obtained were all thousand-year ominous auras, the same for the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood. He initially wanted a droplet, but he obtained three droplets. Aside from that, his bottleneck to the fifth-grade sword intent had loosened.

“Let’s not hurry with the ominous auras and sword intent. You and Lil’ Red can make a breakthrough here!” Lil’ Purple said, looking at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun recalled that the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood effect would only last a few hours. If he didn’t use it now, it would be useless for him to use it for his tribulation. But there wasn’t such a limit to using it for the Divine Tortoise Transformation.

Nodding his head, Lin Yun took out a droplet of Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood and gave it to Lil’ Red. This baffled Lil' Purple, and she asked, “What are you doing? This old tortoise’s strength isn’t lower than your master’s. Since he said that you need two droplets of Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood, you need two droplets.”

“I feel that swordsmen need to receive more temperament.” Lin Yun’s pupils flashed with flames, and he continued, “Most importantly, I want to take the opportunity of this tribulation to make a breakthrough in my sword intent!”

Previously, when he fought with the four Demonic Ranking’s rising stars, Lin Yun could sense that he was making swift progress in his sword intent. He knew he could only make a breakthrough in his sword intent when he was between life and death.

Otherwise, it might take him ten-odd years to make a breakthrough. This was why many swordsmen were stuck at the Spiritual Sword Intent. It wasn’t because their comprehension wasn’t enough, it’s because they didn’t dare to experience life and death.

The reason for that was simple, but not many people could achieve it. After all, those with higher cultivations tended to be more afraid of death.

“I naturally understand the reason, but isn’t it too dangerous for you to try and make a breakthrough in the tribulation?” Lil’ Purple said in a worried tone.

“I can’t keep relying on you, right?” Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple. “You’ve helped me several times. But this time, I want to rely on my strength at the Ancient Barren Battlefield.”

“I don’t mind.” Lil’ Purple said swiftly.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled, “But you’re a phoenix. A phoenix will soar to the sky one day, so you can’t keep following me. Trust me. I will find your body for you one day.”

Lil’ Purple fell into a brief silence before she replied, “Alright. You two refine the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood, while I keep watch for you two.”

Hearing that, Lil’ Red nodded its head. After devouring the remnant soul of the True Dragon, it could easily make a breakthrough with the help of the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood.

Lin Yun and Lil’ Red started to refine a droplet of Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood each as time passed. Four hours later, Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun and noticed that the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood in his palm had dimmed. As he refined it, he began to emit a golden light, and it gradually became dazzled. Looking from afar, it seemed like Lin Yun was covered in a layer of golden light.

“He still hasn’t made a breakthrough?” Lil’ Purple furrowed her brows.

Not only could the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood ensure the cultivator’s safety in the tribulation, but the blood even contained pure energy. If someone else refined it, it wouldn’t take long for them to start attempting their tribulation. But Lin Yun still had no signs of making a breakthrough, not to mention any phenomenon of the tribulation.

Right then, lightning rumbled in the sky as Lil’ Red attempted to make a breakthrough. Similar to Lin Yun, it was also making a breakthrough from the first-pulse to the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and this scene made Lil’ Purple feel relieved.

The Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood would form the Black Tortoise Saint Shield in the crucial moment to block the tribulation, and the breakthrough shouldn’t be a problem for Lil’ Red.

“This scumbag!” Lil’ Purple became anxious as she looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was too slow. If he didn’t undergo his tribulation within another hour, the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood might not be able to form the Black Tortoise Saint Shield. Even if it could form the Black Tortoise Saint Shield, its power would be significantly decreased.

This made Lil’ Purple nervous, hoping to stand in Lin Yun’s position to undergo the tribulation, instead. But in reality, Lin Yun’s heart had collapsed. His fifty thousand feet dragon origin ocean had long reached the pinnacle first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and he could undergo his tribulation anytime he wished.

But the energy and vitality contained within the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood was pure, and the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron absorbed them upon entering his body. The cauldron was like a monster that could never be sated.

This made Lin Yun furious, but he could do nothing about it. Just when Lin Yun felt despair, his dragon origin ocean finally moved and the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron spat out wisps of highly purified energy, which was pure spiritual energy.

That could be considered the impurities to the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron, since it only needed the essence that was within the saint blood. But the purified spiritual energy was precisely what Lin Yun needed, so it didn’t take long for the surface of his dragon origin ocean to become golden.

The gold was pure, and his dragon origin ocean began to boil in the next moment like a boiling ocean. When the energy reached the pinnacle, his dragon origin ocean began to ignite.

When flames exploded, waves of violent aura filled his body, and a powerful aura exploded from him. As thrunder rumbled across the horizon, lightning appeared, looking like a gigantic dragon of a few thousand feet and was connected with the flames blazing within his body.

When a draconic roar echoed from within his body, terrifying lightning streaked across the horizon. This scene left Lil’ Purple dumbfounded. Although Lin Yun’s tribulation finally arrived, this was a little too unbelievable. She now knew why the Black Turtle Ancestor said Lin Yun needed two droplets of Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood.

This instantly made Lil’ Purple nervous because Lin Yun could die under this tribulation. In the end, she had to leave this region. If she continued to stay in this region, she would affect Lin Yun’s tribulation.

“Is it already here? Let’s make a breakthrough then!” Sensing the phenomena within the surroundings, Lin Yun gently smiled, his emotions blazing within his heart. No matter what tribulation he faced, he would just cut it down as a swordsman. His life was in his hands and not heaven!
