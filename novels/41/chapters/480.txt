Chapter 481 - Thunderbolt Slash!

The old man’s face was grim. He felt greatly humiliated that he was fooled by a quasi-Violet Palace realm brat. He never imagined that Lin Yun dared to fool him. He turned into a streak of light and chased after Lin Yun like a bolt of lightning.

On horseback, Lin Yun’s face was pale as blood dripped down from his lips. His chest was caved in and his ribcage was practically deformed. Just moving a little felt painful to him. The casual attack from the old man was already so powerful. Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how powerful it would be if the old man attacked him at full force.

Suddenly, Lin Yun’s face changed. Lil’ Red also stopped. A sonic boom rang out and a comet descended down before them. An old man emitting a violent aura slowly walked out from the cloud of dust to look at Lin Yun coldly, “Why aren’t you running anymore?”

“No one can run from me after snatching the treasure of me, Tan Feng!” snorted the old man coldly.

“Make your move,” replied Lin Yun. Since they couldn’t escape, they could only fight to the death.

The old man was slightly surprised by Lin Yun’s words. Clearly, Lin Yun’s decisiveness made him feel somewhat uncomfortable. Lin Yun was in a sure-death scenario. Not only did Lin Yun not beg for mercy, but he even provoked him.

“Interesting. It has been a long time since I met such an arrogant junior. Now, die!” The old man attacked. He dashed forward and appeared before Lin Yun in the next second. Raising his right fist, he started gathering his origin energy into his fist that lit up in the sky like a fireball.

Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless and he unsheathed the Flower Burial Sword. He executed Luminous Moon, lighting the entire sky white and severing the fireball into two. When the fireball exploded, it separated into numerous fireballs that left deep craters in the ground.

Lin Yun didn’t dare to relax and executed the Seven Profound Steps, leaving behind afterimages while stabbing his sword forward. Each of his afterimages carried a powerful attack.

“Break!” The old man was slightly surprised by Lin Yun’s sword technique. However, he snorted and used his origin energy to destroy all of Lin Yun’s attacks. “Brat, you have no idea how powerful the Violet Palace Realm is!”

Tan Feng roared and threw out a punch. His punch echoed in the air and each echo sent out a shockwave. The pressure from his fist was immense and Lin Yun didn’t have any time to hesitate.

“Myriad Frost!” The Flower Burial Sword began to buzz with sword intent coming from it. In the next second, a blinding flash exploded with boundless chill that quickly spread out. This attack made the old man’s face change slightly as he retreated. Everything in the path of this attack was frozen solid.

“Interesting, but this is nothing before absolute strength!” The old man roared and he charged forward with a punch. It felt as if his punch could even destroy a star.

Taking the hit head-on, Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood and he flew out. The old man was unreasonably strong and Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he looked at the old man.

“I never imagined that you could come this far. You must be the disciple of a quasi-overlord sect,” said the old man as he looked at Lin Yun with greed. Lin Yun’s performance wasn’t any inferior to a genius from a quasi-overlord sect.

This meant that Lin Yun’s background wasn’t simple and that he was a fat lamb. A blazing meteor suddenly appeared and started expanding. It didn’t take long for the entire surrounding area to be covered with a sea of flames. The old man’s aura grew unbelievably strong in the sea of flames.

Lin Yun’s eyebrow twitched because the old man actually summoned his martial soul.

“This meteorite is my martial soul. I’m letting you have a taste of it as a show of my respect for a quasi-overlord sect’s disciple,” laughed the old man. In reality, the old man just didn’t want to give Lin Yun any chance of escaping after determining that Lin Yun had a huge background.

“Die!” Tan Feng roared and his figure appeared before Lin Yun. When he threw his punch forward, it carried the boundless power from the sea of flames. It was like an apocalyptic scene as the meteorite fell down from the sky with endless flames that made one feel despair.

Gnashing his teeth, Lin Yun tried his best to restrain himself from using the xiantian sword intent. It was his biggest trump card and he couldn’t afford to reveal it so easily.

In the name of my sword, bloom!

The Iris Flower in his dantian bloomed and an Iris Flower appeared in the sky. With the Iris Sword Sutra at the ninth stage being pushed to the limit, Lin Yun’s aura was extremely close to the Violet Palace Realm.

“Moon Reflection!” Lin Yun’s body swayed and he separated into nine afterimages. His images looked like reflections and once they overlapped, Lin Yun unleashed a powerful aura that clashed with Tan Feng.

The clash created a huge explosion that sent shockwaves into the surroundings. The aftermath produced a terrifyingly huge crater in the ground. When the flames dissipated, Lin Yun’s figure appeared on the ground. His face was white and he was throwing up blood with one knee on the ground.

The Dracophant Battle Physique was trying to repair his injuries, but even so, the terrifying impact still dealt heavy injuries to him.

“You’re still not dead?” The old man coughed as he walked out from the cloud of dust. He wasn’t exactly in a good state either. When he saw Lin Yun kneeling on one knee, he was shocked. After all, he had used his martial soul in that attack, so he should be able to incinerate his enemies into ashes, even when facing someone who had just stepped into the Violet Palace Realm.

“Hehe, interesting. I’m looking forward to my harvest after killing you. Are you the head disciple of a quasi-overlord sword?” smiled the old man sinisterly. The stronger Lin Yun was, the more tempting he was to a wandering cultivator.

“Come again!” roared Tan Feng with his face distorted.

“Kill!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a cold gleam and he charged over while gritting his teeth.

The two figures began to clash in the sky, leaving the Extermination Barrens behind them.

“Raging Dragon!” Tan Feng unleashed a powerful move. His fist roared and the flames behind him formed a gigantic flaming dragon. The roar from the dragon caused the ground to tremble. Lin Yun was exhausted, but he was still waiting for the right opportunity.

Heavenly Cloud Shatter!

Lin Yun swung out the Flower Burial Sword at the flaming dragon. His sword aura formed into a roaring tornado that clashed with the flaming dragon. The shockwave from the clash made the ground tremble once more, and the two attacks passed by each other before heading towards their target.

The old man threw up a mouthful of blood as he took several steps back. When he raised his head, he saw Lin Yun was knocked away by the flaming dragon and fell into a lake a few thousand meters away, creating a huge crater.

“Hmph, you’re courting death.” Tan Feng coughed and threw up another mouthful of blood before he walked towards Lin Yun with a grim expression. Lin Yun’s strength had far exceeded his imagination, but it had finally come to an end. He didn’t believe that Lin Yun could survive this attack. Even if Lin Yun wasn’t dead, he wouldn’t be far from dying.

The old man approached the crater with excitement in his eyes because he could taste the harvest he would get from this fight. Just thinking about the Heavenly Soul Realm beast core and the entire fortune of a head disciple made him feel excited.

It didn’t take long before he was standing in front of the crater. Just when he was losing himself in his imagination, a powerful sword intent suddenly exploded out from that crater that resonated out with the surroundings.

“Xiantian sword intent!” Tan Feng’s face changed because he knew that he was tricked. He quickly retreated without any hesitation.

“You think you can escape? Old fart, I’ve been waiting for this opportunity for a long time!” Lin Yun soared into the sky. The surroundings began to change under his sword intent and the sky turned dark with rumbling lightning formed by the sword intent echoing in the surroundings. His sword intent had manifested into thunderclouds and rumbling lightning.

Standing in the sky, Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword and swung the sword down. He had unleashed the Overlord Sword’s Thunderbolt Slash.
