Chapter 503 - Violet Palace Realm

Lin Yun jumped on Lil’ Red and it carried Lin Yun and as it continued to run. If Lin Yun was a second slower, he would be in an extremely perilous situation. Lin Yun felt relieved as he rode horseback on Lil’ Red.

He could tell that Lil’ Red had reached the Violet Palace Realm without him knowing, simply by examining its aura. But before he could think about what was going on, the ground began to tremble once more, causing Lin Yun’s face to change.

The Indigo Thunderpython was still chasing after him and it was actually traveling at an even faster speed on land. Compared to Lil’ Red, who needed to dodge the obstacles in the path, the Indigo Thunderpython charged through everything in its way.

“This bastard!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with killing aura. The Indigo Thunderpython clearly had no intentions of letting him off, so Lil’ Red would be caught sooner or later. Since that was the case, Lin Yun instantly made up his mind.

“Lil’ Red, help me hold it back!” Lin Yun tapped Lil’ Red’s neck and then soared into the sky.

The Dragon Blooded Horse suddenly came to a stop as it reared its legs into the sky. When its legs landed on the ground, it turned around to charge at the Indigo Thunderpython like a crimson bolt of lightning. Without any warning, flames began to blaze on Lil’ Red as it turned into a Bloodwinged Demon Dragon.

When it unfolded its wings, its wingspan was nearly a thousand feet and was covered in dragon scales. This scene had caused the python to come to a stop.

“This…” Lin Yun was shocked that the Dragon Blooded Horse could actually transform after reaching the Violet Palace Realm by igniting its bloodline. But he could tell that Lil’ Red couldn’t maintain this form for long. It had just reached the Violet Palace Realm, so it was still too tender compared to the Indigo Thunderpython.

“It’s a race against time,” Lin Yun wore a grave expression as he found a remote corner. After checking his surroundings for safety, Lin Yun took out the Indigoflame Goldlotus from his interspatial pouch. It was something he obtained by risking his life.

He was initially thinking of making preparations before using it to make his breakthrough. However, he was forced into a dead-end by the Indigo Thunderpython, so he had no choice but to refine it now. The Violet Palace Realm required him to refine his origin energy into a liquid state and the consequences would be dire if he failed.

This was his first attempt and he would have to wait two years if he fails. The consequences were tremendous.

“I can’t care about that right now!” Lin Yun gently tapped his interspatial pouch and retrieved six hundred third grade spiritual jades. He got a thousand from Leng Yi and these were the only ones remaining because he used some of them to refine his origin energy into sword energy.

With so many third grade spiritual jades, it was more than enough for Lin Yun to make his breakthrough. If he didn’t run into Leng Yi, he couldn’t imagine how he would obtain this many third grade spiritual jades to make his breakthrough.

However, not even disciples of quasi-overlord forces were able to take out this many third grade spiritual jades, not to mention about the Indigoflame Goldlotus. After all, you could only depend on luck for the lotus.

Lin Yun sat on the ground and circulated the Iris Sword Sutra quietly as an Iris Flower bloomed with him in the center. Immediately, the third grade spiritual jades on the ground were frantically being absorbed.

As time passed, the origin energy Lin Yun exhausted by Lin Yun was recovering at a rapid speed. Simultaneously, an indigo petal from the Indigoflame Goldlotus fell off and slowly entered his mouth.

When the petal entered his mouth, Lin Yun could sense its heat covering his entire body. An indigo flame soon spread throughout his body. Not only his origin energy, but his internal organs and meridians were also being burned by the flame.

The indigo flame was removing all the medicinal residuals that he consumed in the past, the impurities in his origin energy, and the hidden injuries on his body. They were all turned into black smoke as they were being expelled out of his body. It felt great and Lin Yun felt as though his body had gotten lighter.

The Indigoflame Goldlotus was truly worthy of its fame and Lin Yun’s confidence for making a breakthrough surged. He could sense his blood boiling in excitement. If he couldn’t make a breakthrough with the help of the lotus, then he should just quit being a cultivator.

There were many disciples standing by the shore as they looked at the lake slowly calming down. Although they couldn’t see the battle, they could sense how terrifying the python was.

“The ripple is settling down. It looks like Lin Yun is dead,” said Pan Yue. Since the battle had come to an end, Lin Yun must be dead. No one felt that Lin Yun could defeat the Indigo Thunderpython, especially since he was struck by the python’s tail when he snatched the last lotus. That strike alone could shatter all the bones in anyone’s body.

“That fellow is really terrifying. But it’s fortunate that he’s dead. Otherwise, god only knows what he’ll do,” said Han Fei with lingering fear. Everyone else’s faces slightly changed at those words. Clearly, Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent and Thunderbolt Slash had planted deep fear in them. Just recalling it left their backs wet from sweat.

“But it’s a pity for the lotuses. It looks like our efforts have gone down the drain,” said Ye Cangming out of depression. He became a wandering cultivator after he betrayed his sect. So he needed treasures to cultivate.

Pan Yue suddenly turned his gaze as if he had just thought of something. He smiled, “Brother Ye, I do have an idea that you might be interested in.”

“What is it?” asked Ye Cangming.

“Brother Ye, the Heavenly Province Academy is ranked at the bottom of the five quasi-overlord forces in the Nether Prefecture. If we rob their party, it’ll be a decent harvest even without the lotuses,” smiled Pan Yue.

Ye Cangming swept his glance and looked at the Heavenly Province Academy’s party. Liu Yunyan was currently comforting a lass right now, but they did seem like a piece of fat meat.

“Hehe, I have no objections,” smiled Ye Cangming sinisterly. He wasn’t new to robbing.

Pan Yue didn’t seem surprised by Ye Cangming’s answer as he looked at Han Fei and Nie Feng with a smile, “What do you guys think?”

“Count me out.” Nie Feng glanced at the few of them before he left with the Shattered Sword Pavilion’s disciples.

Han Fei didn’t say a word, but his eyes flashed with interest. “The Heavenly Province Academy is proficient in spiritual runes and all of them are wealthy. It’ll be a decent harvest if we can rob them. But Liu Yunyan isn’t a pushover and it’ll be a loss to both sides if we push her too far.”

“I have my preparations,” smiled Pan Yue mysteriously. “If you guys can gather seven hundred third grade spiritual jades, I can add on three hundred more to get Brother Leng to create an array. At that time, we can just sit and watch the demonic beasts attack them. We just have to force them at that time. There will be nothing Liu Yunyan can do about it.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“This is a good idea, but the amount of spiritual jades needed is a little too much,” said Han Fei.

“The loss does not make up for the gains in my eyes with so many spiritual jades,” added Ye Cangming.

“Please rest assured. I’m only using them to activate the spiritual jades and I won’t exhaust too many of them. I’ll return them to you guys once everything ends,” smiled Leng Yi.

Both Ye Cangming and Han Fei exchanged a glance with interest in their eyes. Seven hundred third grade spiritual jades wasn’t a small number, but they had so many people here. They could gather them up one way or another.

Seeing that the two were interested, Pan Yue smiled, “Since that’s the case, then we’ll need to do some planning.”

Half a day later, Lin Yun released a powerful radiance as a shocking energy swept out into the surroundings. The Indigoflame Goldlotus was only left with the fruit. The fruit then turned into flames as it enveloped Lin Yun, slowly fusing into his body.

When the lotus fruit fused into his body, Lin Yun instantly released a terrifying aura. His origin energy rushed through his ten profound veins before flowing into his dantian. His origin energy had been condensed into liquid and he had opened a silver violet palace in his dantian.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, they flickered with a silvery glow. Clenching his fist together, he could sense the immense power coursing through his body. It left him greatly shocked.

“This is the Violet Palace Realm?” Lin Yun punched the ground, creating cracks that quickly spread out. When the cloud of dust settled down, a huge crater was revealed.

Lin Yun stood at the corner of the crater as he released his aura, snapping all the trees within a ten mile radius. Right at this moment, a familiar roar sounded out as Lin Yun turned his head over. He could see the Indigo Thunderpython was still fighting with Lil’ Red.

“Since it has chosen to come out of the lake, then it can forget about going back,” muttered Lin Yun with killing aura surging in his eyes. In the next second, he disappeared from where he was standing.
