“Chen Zhong is a disciple of the Nether Orchid Courtyard. It has been ten years since he last returned to the sect. He has been wandering within the God Burial Forest’s Nine Nether Battlefield. He’s a genius swordsman from the Nether Orchid Courtyard and became a saint’s disciple a decade ago. He’s also the only one in the past century who has succeeded in practicing the Nether Sword Sutra in the Nether Orchid Courtyard.”

“The Nether Sword Sutra?!” Chen Feng’s face changed. It was famed for being one of the hardest sword sutras to learn, and learning it was painful. Strictly speaking, this was a sword sutra belonging to the Netherworld Hall, and it was obtained by a senior from the Heavenly Dao Sect who placed it in the Nether Orchid Courtyard. To practice this sword sutra, one had to be enveloped in a death aura, and they would be crippled if they made a mistake in their cultivation.

“It looks like this ranking battle is becoming more interesting!”

“Ouyang He, Ye Feifan, Bai Shuying, and even Chen Zhong came out. Those three had an intense fight amongst themselves in the past, but I wonder who can make it higher.”

“Ye Feifan and Bai Shuying made it through the second level before, and there’s a high chance they can make it through the third level. Chen Zhong hasn’t come here for years, but he should be able to make it through the third level.”

“So the fourth level is the key!” Everyone was discussing amongst themselves, predicting who could get through the fourth level.

That also made sense because Ye Qingtian was only at the Profound Death Stage, even if he was heaven-defying. Compared to those they mentioned earlier, Ye Qingtian would need to improve in both reputation and cultivation, since he had just become a saint disciple.

The ancient sword was ten feet in height on the mountain, and there were a lot of saint fruits around it. When Lin Yun reached the peak, a saint fruit flew over, and he quickly grabbed onto it. When he looked at the saint fruit, he was surprised because this could be used to strengthen the sword intent. “The Heavenly Cloud Fruit?”

The grey-clothed youth appeared behind Lin Yun and casually grabbed a saint fruit. When he saw Lin Yun stowing the saint fruit, he said, “It’s best to refine this Heavenly Cloud Fruit here because the effects will greatly decline after leaving this place. Also, don’t touch the other saint fruits, or you’ll suffer greatly. You can only obtain one.”

Lin Yun expressed his gratitude for the reminder, but he still stowed the fruit because he had no intention of refining it on the spot.

The grey-clothed youth merely smiled when he saw this scene and said nothing else.

“What’s your name?” Lin Yun asked.

“You’re still not worthy of knowing my name,” the grey-clothed youth said before taking a medal from his waist. A celestial crane flew out from the clouds, lifting him to the second level.

After he left, Lin Yun took out the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella to resist the pressure before the Black Tortoise Chains flew out from his palm. When the Black Tortoise Chains returned, it brought back many saint fruits, leaving only four to five left.

Lin Yun waved his hand, and the Black Tortoise Chains flew over and swept through the remaining Heavenly Cloud Fruits. When he stowed the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and Black Tortoise Chains, Lin Yun awkwardly looked at the bare ground and noticed that he had accidentally seized all of the fruits.

“They should still be able to grow more.” Lin Yun rubbed his nose and no longer cared about it.

“Finally, there’s somewhere suitable for us to speak. Ye Qingtian, don’t tell me you have forgotten about me?” A familiar voice resounded. It came from the woman who had followed him earlier.

After seeing what was inside the sackcloth clothes, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling weird while looking at this woman again, and he couldn’t help taking a few glances at her.

“It looks like you haven’t forgotten our days together. There’s no one here now, so you can tell me if you found what I asked you to find a year ago,” the woman smiled.

Lin Yun’s gaze immediately became sharp as he looked at the woman. A year ago? Didn’t Ye Qingtian sneak into the Nether Orchid Courtyard to peek at Bai Shuying's bathing? It turned out this woman was the mastermind behind that, and he now knew why she kept probing him right from the start.

Sensing Lin Yun’s sharp gaze, the woman smiled, “Ye Qingtian, didn’t you want to perform Yin-Yang cultivation with me before? I'll fulfill your wish if you tell me what you saw.”

Lin Yun didn’t reply and was in deep thought, wondering who this woman was. Since she could sneak into the Heavenly Dao Sect without anyone knowing, she shouldn’t be simple. But just when he was in deep thought, the woman approached him and gently took a whiff.

“You’re not Ye Qingtian!” Before Lin Yun came to his senses, the woman raised her head and looked at him with murderous intent flashing within her pupils.

“Who are you, then?” Lin Yun asked calmly.

“Ha. You have even forgotten me. It looks like you’re really not Ye Qingtian. Speak, where’s Ye Qingtian!” The woman said. She was close to Lin Yun, making her face look even more enchanting, like melted snow. This was a flawless face filled with charm, and she had secretly used her mental energy. But her mental energy was severed when she got close to Lin Yun.

“Go ask the Dragon Origin Great Saint, if you dare.” Lin Yun looked back at the woman’s eyes. They were close together, and would make a move any moment now.

“Ye Qingtian, what are you doing?” A bark resounded as Bai Shuying walked over.

The woman quickly retreated. Her sackcloth clothes disappeared into a gorgeous purple robe as she spun around.

“Junior Brother Ye is talking about Yin-Yang cultivation with me. What’s the matter? Does Junior Sister Bai want to interfere? You have to queue up if you’re interested,” the woman smiled.

“Wang Muyan, you’re disgusting.” Bai Shuying looked disgusted, with her face becoming red.

“Haha. The Nether Orchid Holy Maiden still tries to pretend to be pure. Love is the happiest thing in the world, but you don’t understand that. However, I don’t mind teaching you,” Wang Muyan smiled. But she clearly had reservations and was afraid of Bai Shuying. So she merely gave Lin Yun a wink before she left.

“Junior Brother Ye, we’ll meet again in the future.” Wang Muyan smiled.

After Wang Muyan left, Bai Shuying mockingly looked at Lin Yun. She said, “Ye Qingtian, you’re really impressive. I don't know when you’ve gotten involved with the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden.”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled upon hearing that, but he couldn’t explain. In the past, he was afraid to see Bai Shuying, and he had never felt so relieved to be seeing her before.

There was something weird about Wang Muyan; he couldn’t find anything from probing her earlier. But he was in a disadvantageous position because he couldn’t even see through her cultivation, which was terrifying.

Since Bai Shuying said that she was the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, it all made sense then. But he couldn’t figure out why the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden wanted Ye Qingtian to sneak into the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

“Ye Qingtian, you better stay further away from her. All the saint disciples after her fainted, and she’s probably the mastermind.” Bai Shuying summoned a celestial crane and said to Lin Yun before leaving. But she soon came to her senses because she had no relationship with him, so why did she have to give him a warning? Thinking about it here, the resentment within her pupils grew even denser when she looked at Ye Qingtian. Since Ye Qingtian returned, her heart had become a mess. She started to think that she should’ve killed him back then.

“Ye Qingtian, don’t ever appear before me again!” Bai Shuying said before leaving on the celestial crane.

“What’s wrong with her? Why did she warn me to avoid the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden and ask me not to appear before her…?” Lin Yun sighed and took out a medal to summon a Celestial Crane before heading to the second level.

The Celestial Purging Mountain concerned the Astral Sword Intent, and he naturally wouldn’t back down because of two women.
