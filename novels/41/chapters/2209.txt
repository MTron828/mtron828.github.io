Chapter 2210 - Time Flows Like Water (1)

The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was powerful, and fine cracks began to appear on the Emperor Sword Array, which made many people throw out a mouthful of blood under the heavy blow.

“Not good!” The faces of the Great Saints changed, but it was already too late for them to make a move.

At this moment, a roar echoed, “Oh, Azure Dragon, please aid me!”

His voice was so loud that it made everyone’s souls tremble, and a lightning bolt soared to the sky, lighting up everyone’s faces in the critical moment. The lightning was like an ancient dragon that reached the top of the Emperor Sword Array. When the lightning dissipated, it revealed Lin Yun with the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella opened, activating five glory spirits on it.

Under a massive explosion, Lin Yun withstood the impact of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda by himself with his umbrella, preventing the pagoda from falling onto the Emperor Sword Array. This was a shocking scene because Lin Yun was only a Quasi-Saint, using his body to withstand the full force of a time-space treasure.

“Ye Qingtian?!” Wang Muyan was enveloped in golden radiance, and she was shocked when she saw Lin Yun raising the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. Even if Lin Yun had revealed his identity, Wang Muyan still treated him as Ye Qingtian in her heart.

Lin Yun raised his head to look at Wang Muyan. The two had finally reached this point.

“Ye Qingtian, give up. You can’t hold on,” Wang Muyan’s voice rang out in Lin Yun’s ears.

As a time-space treasure, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was far more powerful than the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. Lin Yun barely managed to withstand it after activating five glory spirits.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“How will I know without giving it a try?” Lin Yun smiled with a determined look. He couldn’t be bothered which was stronger, and it wasn’t his style to turn a blind eye either. He would know after trying to see if the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella could stop the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, even if his attempt wouldn’t change the outcome.

“Oh, Azure Dragon!” Lin Yun roared as he activated the Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits on it. With that, seven glory spirits of the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella had been activated with a powerful impact released by the umbrella. With an explosion, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was knocked away and the hands beneath the pagoda disappeared.

Blood dripped down from Wang Muyan’s lips, and she was surprised with her face paled. But just when she was about to control the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, she noticed Lin Yun’s clothes had burst apart and were covered in blood. His injuries were more serious than hers, and the fine cracks on the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella were even more terrifying.

After all, the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella was an ancient Sovereign Saint Artifact, and yet there was already so much internal damage. Naturally, the umbrella couldn’t withstand it when Lin Yun forcibly controlled it to clash with the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was a time-space treasure. Time and space were both Eternal Daos and their power would naturally be unimaginable.

Wang Muyan bit her lips with a hint of fury because she didn’t know why Lin Yun persevered. What did the Heavenly Dao Sect have to do with him? Everything would be fine if he let the Saint Lords take Bai Shuying away, and they didn’t have to come to this point.

Lin Yun was the direct disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, so why did he have to get involved with the Heavenly Dao Sect’s matters? Wasn’t he afraid of death? Was it worth it for one Bai Shuying?

As Wang Muyan became even more angry, she undid the seal on the mysterious power within her body once more, and she became enveloped in divinity, looking as dignified as a deity.

“Is the divine maiden finally going to become serious? That wasn’t easy…” the red-clothed youth looked at Wang Muyan.

Wang Muyan had a special position within the Blood Moon Sect. So even if he was the sect master, the red-clothed youth couldn’t force Wang Muyan to do what she didn’t like, and he had already prepared a card to use in case Wang Muyan declined, but it appears that he didn’t have to go that far now. This also meant that everything should come to an end now.

When the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda and Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella clashed again, the fluctuation they caused this time was even greater. The energy shockwave alone left ripples and holes in the Emperor Sword Array.

But the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda that symbolized destruction still failed to descend, and Lin Yun supported it with the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

“Shit!” Ye Guhan’s face changed because he noticed that Lin Yun was in a terrible state. Before he could decide, the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella exploded and the glory spirits dimmed.

Lin Yun also threw out a mouthful of blood as the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella became covered in cracks in his hand. This time, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda resolved most of the attack from the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, and even the dragon's soul let out a miserable roar.

This was because the power within Wang Muyan was too mysterious and ancient. The current Lin Yun still couldn’t confront it.

When Wang Muyan saw this scene, her heart clenched as she quickly controlled the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda to suspend in the air. Without the support of the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, even a Saint Sovereign would be heavily injured if the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda fell onto them.

Lil’ Purple waved her hand and dragged Lin Yun over.

“I failed to stop it? She’s really ruthless.” Lin Yun looked at the damaged umbrella as he threw out a mouthful of blood, and his face paled.

“You should take care of yourself. If she hadn’t gone easy on you, you would’ve died earlier,” Lil’ Purple said, feeling heartache as she looked at Lin Yun’s injuries. She knew better than anyone about the power sealed within Wang Muyan, and that was an existence that even she was afraid of. That power was a taboo in this era.

The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda briefly paused before swiftly falling towards the Emperor Sword Array. This time, countless cracks appeared on the ground, with a cloud of dust sweeping through everyone.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s Saint Soul, which was fighting with the red-clothed youth and Star Asura King, also became dim. Practically in a split second, the Saint Soul returned to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s body and she opened her eyes with blood dripping down her lips.

“Let him launch the final attack,” the red-clothed youth laughed, and his laughter was filled with dominance.

“Moon Picking Hand!” With a roar, a crimson moon rose from his palm once more as he slammed it down, shattering the golden barrier completely.

The five Great Saints on the altar quickly pulled everyone behind them to block the incoming shockwave.

As the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda hovered in the air, the red-clothed youth and Star Asura King landed on the tattered plaza as victors.

The Wang Clan and Ye Clan’s Saints came behind the red-clothed youth shortly after.

The Heavenly Dao Sect’s party had retreated to a corner as both parties released their constellations before they fell into a stalemate.

The red-clothed youth wore a smile as he swept his gaze through everyone. He smiled, “Are we still going to continue?”

The Great Saints frowned because they had only recovered half of their strength, and there was no way they could fight.

“How about this?” The red-clothed youth smiled and said, “Bring that brat out, and I will guarantee with my identity as the Blood Moon Sect’s sect master that I won’t kill him and will send him back once I’m done. We also won’t interfere with the Heavenly Dao Sect’s affairs, but you guys must leave, including the Zhang and Bai Clans.”

When those from the Ye Clan heard what the red-clothed youth said, they had excitement on their faces. If the Blood Moon Sect and the two clans leave the Heavenly Dao Sect, the Heavenly Dao Sect would belong to the Ye Clan.

The faces of those from the Bai and Zhang Clan changed.

“Dream on!” The Thousand Plume Great Saint roared. “You put the Heavenly Dao Sect in such a mess and want to leave with the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda? Fat chance!”

The red-clothed youth wasn’t bothered by the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s tone, but he smiled, “I’m not negotiating. If you guys disagree, I can just kill everyone here, then. It’s a pity since all of you are geniuses, especially the two disciples of the Radiant Sword Saint. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint is also a heroine, and even I will be afraid of you once you become an Emperor.”

The red-clothed youth was decisive as he dashed forth with a crimson flash.

This immediately changed the faces of the Great Saints from the Heavenly Dao Sect’s faction. They quickly made their moves and charged with the Thousand Plume Great Saint in the lead.

“How will you guys fight me without the Emperor Sword Array? You think I don’t have a temper?” the red-clothed youth’s gaze became cold. He was genuinely furious now and no longer held back as he pushed his palm forth.

Before the Serene Dust Great Saint could react, she was sent flying and slammed against the cliff behind the altar.

With a wave of his hand, the red-clothed youth’s hair began to flutter with crimson moons flashing in his eyes. His hand fell onto the shoulder of the Thousand Plume Great Saint, but the latter couldn’t keep up with his speed.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint’s shoulder was crushed as he fell to the ground with one knee. It was so painful that his face had become distorted.

“You might be able to exchange a few moves with me at your prime, but I can easily crush you like an ant in your current state. Great Saint, you have become old, and the times have changed. Even if you didn’t run into me, it’d be hard for you to become an Emperor in your lifetime,” the red-clothed youth said as he gave a chop towards the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s neck.

“Stop!” Ye Guhan arrived as the surrounding space began to ripple as he swung his sword, unleashing thousands of attacks from different trajectories.

The red-clothed youth stood with his hands behind him, and said, “Times have changed, and someone like you is a genuine expert. Grasping Space Dao as a Great Saint and even practicing the Profound Sky Canon and Great Profound Sword Canon together.”

The red-clothed youth smiled, “If I was not proficient in Space Dao as well, my clone might not be able to do anything to you.”

As soon as he said that, he stopped and reached out with his right hand, clamping onto the Azure River Sword. The sword couldn’t move another inch, and the red-clothed youth smiled, “You can try to execute the two cultivation techniques again and see if I’ll fall for it."

Ye Guhan couldn’t pull his sword out no matter how he tried, showing a strained expression.
