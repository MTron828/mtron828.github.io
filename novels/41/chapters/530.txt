Chapter 531 - Pithole

Lin Yun couldn’t see through Mo Lin. She was a lot stronger than Mei Ziyan, and it would be troublesome if she wanted the Infernal Flower. Thinking about it, Lin Yun smiled, “Senior Sister is really well-informed.

Lin Yun opened his palm and a flower appeared. Looking at the flower, Mo Ling praised, “It’s indeed the Infernal Flower. There was a Profound Yang Palace’s disciple who refined it and his cultivation reached an unbelievable height in one day.”

Seeing that Mo Ling was calm without greed in her eyes, Lin Yun smiled bitterly. He knew that he had really misunderstood her. If she really wanted the Infernal Flower, the elders would’ve taken it from him without her needing to ask for it.

Storing the Infernal Flower, Lin Yun pondered briefly before he told Mo Ling what happened with Mei Ziyan.

“Profound Yang Pellets?” Mo Ling couldn’t help laughing out loud. She was absolutely stunning and laughed.

“Your temper is still the same as always. You just dealt with Gu Feng and Gu Teng yesterday, now you’ve tricked Mei Ziyan today. You’re really arrogant. And here I thought you would restrain yourself a little.” Mo Ling looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile.

“How can you say that? Senior Brother Mei clearly gave them to me for free,” smiled Lin Yun.

“You clearly tricked him. There’s no need to be afraid of him though. He won’t dare to do anything to you in the academy.” When Mo Ling mentioned Mei Ziyan, her eyes were filled with disdain and loathe. The two must have some grudges.

“This person likes to stand against me, trying to compete with me for the chief disciple title. But he doesn’t dare to fight me openly. Half a year ago, he restrained himself after I taught him a lesson. But he still couldn’t contain himself. Honestly speaking, he was the one who incited Gu Feng to deal with you,” said Mo Ling.

Lin Yun frowned since he didn’t know about that. However, he didn’t want to be involved in Mei Ziyan and Mo Ling’s affair for the time being. He changed the topic, “Senior Sister, you don’t seem to be interested in the Infernal Flower.”

Nodding her head, Mo Ling replied, “A fourth grade spiritualist is comparable to a Heavenly Soul Realm. I’ll surely become a fourth grade spiritualist within three years. So martial cultivation isn’t that important to me.”

She sounded really confident when she made her declaration. Then, Mo Ling started her lesson with Lin Yun.

“Senior Sister, can you teach me more spiritual diagrams?” Lin Yun was excited as he had tested the Infernal Mountain and River Painting on Gu Feng. He was looking forward to more spiritual diagrams.

“I’m afraid I can’t…” Looking at the disappointment on Lin Yun’s face, Mo Ling continued, “But I can teach you a third grade spiritual diagram. At your cultivation, second grade spiritual diagrams are pretty much pointless, but not third grade spiritual diagrams. If you can bring out 100% of it, you might even be able to kill greater Yang stage cultivators.”

Lin Yun hesitated briefly and replied, “But I’m not a third grade spiritualist nor do I know any third grade spiritual runes.”

“But you’ll eventually become one, right?” smiled Mo Ling. Lin Yun was at a complete loss and he didn’t know how to refute those words.

“I’ll be teaching you the Ablaze Phoenix Painting, which can be ranked in the top ten of third grade spiritual diagrams.” A terrifying aura spread out from Mo Ling as nine paintings hovered behind her. The nine paintings were lined up as they opened up at the same time. In the next second, dazzling flames and radiating golden brilliance burst out.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes because it was too bright. He could even feel stinging pain on his face. When the nine paintings unfolded fully, a phoenix painting appeared before Lin Yun. The phoenix suddenly flapped its wings and the nine paintings were torn apart. A terrifying aura swept out and Lin Yun’s face changed as he retreated.

When he landed on the ground, he raised his head to see the paintings were still hovering behind Mo Ling. This time, Lin Yun was deeply shocked by the Ablaze Phoenix Painting.

It had been a long time since he had such a feeling. He still remembered the first time he saw the rose painting. At that time, he even threw the painting away when he saw the tiger pouncing at him. However, since then, he never had such a deep shock from a spiritual diagram. But he had finally felt that way again because of the Ablaze Phoenix Painting.

“That was embarrassing,” smiled Lin Yun bitterly as he rubbed his nose.

“The Ablaze Phoenix Painting is a fire third grade spiritual diagram. It has three thousand elementary spiritual runes, one thousand first grade spiritual runes, five hundred second grade spiritual runes, and seven third grade spiritual runes. In terms of lethality, it can be ranked among the top ten. Aside from me, no one else in the academy has grasped it,” said Mo Ling.

Lin Yun didn’t dare to daydream during her explanation and made sure he imprinted everything in his mind. He had a feeling that he could comprehend more of the rose painting if he could grasp this spiritual diagram. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The seven third grade spiritual runes are all on the phoenix tail - the seven feathers. You can ignore them for now since I’ll teach them to you after you become a third grade spiritualist.” Mo Ling withdrew the paintings, chose a specific one, and then threw it out, “Let’s start with the first one…”

Lin Yun held onto the painting that felt heavy in his hands. It wasn’t something that a second grade spiritual diagram could compare to. When he unfolded the painting, he would occasionally frown while he looked at it. He could practically memorize second grade spiritual diagrams, but he was actually having a hard time with this third grade spiritual diagram.

He would miss out on many details if he wasn’t careful enough. In just a brief moment, his eyes were dry and dazed.

Mo Ling asked, “How much have you remembered?”

“Barely 30%,” responded Lin Yun.

“Not bad. I could barely memorize 20% of the spiritual runes when I looked at it for the first time.” Mo Ling had admiration on her face. Lin Yun’s talent was even stronger than her’s.

“It’s not the same.” Lin Yun shook his head. “Spiritual diagrams aren’t martial techniques. If I can’t remember martial techniques, I can still use them. The only issue is that they will be a bit weak. However, if I miss out on even one elementary spiritual rune, everything will be ruined. Even if I remember 90%, it’s no different from remembering 30%.”

Mo Ling frowned and replied, “This is the Ablaze Phoenix Painting that’s ranked top ten among all third grade spiritual diagrams. For those who are weak, they can barely see its outline after looking at it for three days.”

“So what? Didn’t you say that I will eventually become a third grade spiritualist?” smiled Lin Yun. The Ablaze Phoenix Painting had aroused a sense of pride in him. He had never encountered such a challenge before, so he was filled with excitement.

Mo Ling saw her past self in Lin Yun. Back then, she was still young and filled with pride. At this moment, her heart rippled for once. She gathered her thoughts and smiled, “I hope that you get close. A third grade spiritualist is just the beginning. You’ll know what I mean when you get there.”

Over the next few days, Lin Yun stayed in the Nightcloud Hall, not returning to the Spiritwood Peak. If he was exhausted, he would casually lay down on the floor and take a brief rest. When he was done resting, he would continue observing the Ablaze Phoenix Painting.

Five days had passed without him knowing and the floor was filled with papers that he had thrown away. Lin Yun’s eyes were bloodshot at this point. If it wasn’t for the pinnacle Dracophant Battle Physique, he probably wouldn’t have lasted this long. The past five days felt like half a year.

But Lin Yun’s effort didn’t go down the drain. He had finally grasped the Ablaze Phoenix Painting. Of course, this was excluding the phoenix tail. This meant that the painting would be complete if he grasped the seven spiritual runes.

Five days later, Lin Yun opened up the nine paintings and he smiled, “Senior Sister Mo, take a look.”

“Not bad.” Mo Ling was shocked, but she tried her best to maintain her composure.

“Can you teach me third grade spiritual runes now?” smiled Lin Yun.

“I can, but our time has come,” said Mo Ling.

“Hmmm?” Lin Yun was stunned by those words. Then he recalled that half a month had passed. Back then, he was reluctant to accept her teaching. But now, he was fully immersed in it. He never expected that Mo Ling would dig such a huge pithole for him. He already came this far in the Ablaze Phoenix Painting, so it was impossible for him to give up. But he would have to beg Mo Ling if he opened his mouth.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly, “That’s a really deep pithole. Out with it. What does the academy need my help with to teach me the Ablaze Phoenix Painting?”

Mo Ling smiled, “You’re the arrogant Flower Burial. So how can I possibly convince you without using some tricks? I apologize for using such tricks when the academy needs your help.”
