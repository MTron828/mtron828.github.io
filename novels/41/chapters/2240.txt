Chapter 2241 - All Of It

“I really can’t read you…” The Asura Dove King held onto the jade bottle and was speechless as he looked at Lin Yun as though something in his heart was touched. “No matter what, thanks for your Mandala Fragrance, and I owe you one. The Blood Flame Plains is dangerous, and I hope you can come alive. Otherwise… I won’t be able to repay you for your favor.”

The Asura Dove King looked at Lin Yun deeply before he spread his arms apart and disappeared.

“I see. It’s no wonder why you’re so calm about him,” Lil’ Purple said. “You made me worried for nothing.”

“His Overlord Sword piqued my memories. Let’s not talk about that and hurry to the Blood Flame Plains,” Lin Yun sighed. He didn’t forget his objective here, the Divine Blood Fruit and Su Ziyao. The two were most likely in the Blood Flame Plains, and Lin Yun was pretty calm about the divine flames.

“Empress, can you locate the Lunar Divine Rune with the Solar Divine Rune?” Lin Yun suddenly asked.

“I can try it, but I’m not sure about it since we’re in the Heavenly Void,” Lil’ Purple said.

“You can enter the Iris Secret Realm if anything happens while Lil’ Red follows me.”

Since there were many forces in the Blood Flame Plains, Lin Yun wore a mask to cover half of his face before moving out. When he stepped into the Blood Flame Plains, he could feel an invisible pressure crushing down, surprising him.

The gravity here is ten times that of the outside world. Lin Yun soon had an answer after briefly sensing it. This was good news to him because ten times gravity was nothing since he trained in the Blood Purgatory Mountain.

He avoided many Blood Crow guards when he stepped into the Blood Flame Plains and stopped beneath a pillar. He poured his sword intent into his eyes and his vision began extending out. But it was a pity that the sword intent wasn’t that effective here since it was affected by the crimson mist, and he could only capture blurred sceneries.

Ultimately, he headed towards an ancient tree where he could sense a powerful saint elixir’s aura. This saint elixir was ancient and at least ten thousand years old.

Not long after Lin Yun entered the woods, he could hear screams as a second-stage Saint Lord was pierced by a long spear. As the Saint Lord let out a scream, he tried his best to block, but there was nothing he could do about it and he soon lost his life in mid-air before exploding into fragments with his saint origin, saint soul, and saint constellation torn into pieces.

That ancient spear disappeared into space, and he couldn’t tell who had launched that attack.

“Holy shit. Big Brother, what kind of damned place is this?” Lin Yun and Lil’ Red were hiding in the dark. They were shocked when they saw this scene.

“What was it that attacked him?” Lin Yun frowned. He wasn’t sure if the one making a move was a Blood Crow King, a demonic cultivator, or a tree. If the Asura Dove King was here, he might have been able to see something.

“Let’s go and take a look.” Lin Yun came to the fragments with a few flashes, and saw that the bones had crumbled. A saint’s physique was an acquired saint physique. Even if they didn’t temper their physique, their bodies were tougher than ordinary saint artifacts.

But now, a Saint was killed by an unknown enemy with his body pierced.

Just when Lin Yun was feeling shocked, a suction force came that absorbed the remains of that saint. When Lin Yun raised his head, he could only see a black hole. This black hole looked like a vortex that could devour everything. He didn’t move while Lil’ Red was dragged over.

Seeing this, Lin Yun released his sword intent to tear that suction force apart. When he soared to the sky, he instantly discovered the origin of this black hole. It was a crimson python that had opened its mouth wide to consume the flesh and blood of saints on the ground.

It didn’t want to let Lil’ Red go as well, planning to devour it. Lin Yun unleashed a sword ray in mid-air at that python, but it was dodged as the python knocked down several trees. Seeing that Lin Yun was a tough opponent, it quickly retreated. But Lil’ Red didn’t want to let it go and took on the Ancient Dracoape form, charging at the python.

Lin Yun noticed that the crimson python was an ordinary Saint Lord in the first-stage, and he didn’t move to guard the surroundings. A few minutes later, the mysterious person he was worried about didn’t appear and Lil’ Red killed the crimson python before immediately devouring it. After devouring the saint core, Lil' Red’s aura grew even stronger.

“Big Brother, this crimson python tastes pretty good. Do you want to give it a try?” Lil’ Red grinned.

Lin Yun shook his head, not daring to consume the raw flesh. However, he wouldn’t mind roasting it if he had time.

Although it was easy to kill the crimson python, Lin Yun didn’t dare to relax as he cautiously moved in the woods. A poisonous fog enveloped the entire woods, making this place look like a maze. For a long time, Lin Yun suspected that the aura of a saint elixir that he had sensed earlier was fake.

Two days later, when Lin Yun was about to give up, a battle commotion drew his attention and he saw a Saint facing another crimson python. This person was a Saint Elder of the Heavenly Flame Sect, and Lin Yun had seen this person beside Liu Yunlan before.

This old man was powerful, facing three crimson pythons alone. But he didn’t seem to be in a good situation as ten-odd crimson pythons were around him, and those pythons were like crimson rivers flowing across the ground.

Lil’ Red’s eyes lit up. Lin Yun might not have had a good time over the past few days, but Lil’ Red was having fun while eating beast cores. So, it naturally became excited when it saw so many crimson pythons.

“Big Brother…” Lil’ Red was tempted to make a move, rubbing its hands together.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

But Lin Yun shook his head because he could sense an extremely terrifying aura amongst the crimson pythons. There was a python that should be a third-stage Saint Lord, and it was too dangerous to go out.

“Big Brother, is that the Divine Blood Fruit you’re looking for?” Lil’ Red’s eyes lit up as they pointed in a direction.

When Lin Yun looked over, he saw many saint elixirs and flowers growing on a mountain. Amongst the saint elixirs, one stood out and gave off a strong fragrance. Lin Yun first rejoiced upon seeing it but his eyes quickly became dim. That was the Blood Cloud Saint Fruit.

He had obtained it before once, but this one was at least over ten thousand years old and was stained with divine blood. This was stronger than the one he had refined in the past by at least ten times. Aside from the Blood Cloud Saint Fruit, there were also other fruits and various flowers. They were all treasures in the outside world, and this mountain alone was comparable to the foundation of half a powerful sect.

“It might not be a Divine Blood Fruit, but it’s still precious.” Lin Yun soon figured out that the Heavenly Flame Sect’s Saint Elder probably wanted to take the Blood Cloud Saint Fruit and was attacked by the crimson pythons. This was a good opportunity for him.

He soared to the sky and flew towards the mountain, wanting to immediately seize the Blood Cloud Saint Fruit.

Right then, a golden blade ray flew over. This blade ray was terrifying, containing Blade Dao and Fire Dao. Even Lin Yun didn’t dare to take it head-on, so he soared to the sky to dodge the attack.

But that was only the beginning, as multiple golden sword rays flew over, distorting his space, instantly turning it into a purgatory of blade rays. The one who attacked thought Lin Yun would die as he headed straight for the Blood Cloud Saint Fruit.

Lin Yun threw out multiple punches to destroy all the incoming blade rays. When that assailant wanted to reach out for the Blood Cloud Saint Fruit, Lin Yun drew his sword and unleashed a sword ray. His attack shocked that bladesman into drawing his blade to face his enemy.

After Lin Yun shattered all the blade rays, lightning flashed in his palm as nine chains flew out; seeing that the bladesman was held down, he quickly lifted the entire mountain with the Black Thunder Chains.

The mountain, which was nearly a thousand meters, was broken apart by the Black Thunder Chains when Lin Yun tugged them, causing the entire mountain to crumble apart. But because of his excellent control over his strength, the Blood Cloud Saint Fruits and other elixirs were safe.

The bladesman facing the Flower Burial Sword was dumbfounded when he saw this scene. He didn’t know where this barbarian who lifted the entire mountain came from. Aside from the Blood Cloud Saint Fruit, there were ten-odd other saint fruits, and Lin Yun wanted to monopolize them all.

The bladesman was furious as he knocked the Flower Burial Sword back with his blade because he was nearly injured by it when he was distracted.

“Excellent blade technique!” Lin Yun stowed all of the saint fruits in his interspatial bracelet. This could be considered a massive harvest. At least he didn’t wander around for nothing for the past few days. He reached out and grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword, then looked at the bladesman, “Good blade technique.”

Lin Yun recognized this bladesman, Liu Yunlan of the Heavenly Flame Sect. He was only a hundred years old and was already a Saint, known as the Billow Cloud Saint Lord, with a cultivation at the pinnacle second-stage Saint Lord. It was no wonder that his blade technique was so powerful.

“Who the hell are you?” Liu Yunlan asked, suppressing his anger.

Lin Yun wore a mask that covered half of his face, so Liu Yunlan couldn’t recognize this person. But he had a feeling that his person must have a huge origin.

“Why don’t you take a guess?” Lin Yun smiled.
