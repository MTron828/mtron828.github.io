Chapter 214 - Challenge!

The Sword Firmament Pavilion forbade any form of fighting. Killing a fellow disciple was a great taboo and anyone in violation of this would be severely punished. To begin with, Lin Yun was already injured when he was stabbed by Ye Liuyun.

Just when everyone couldn’t bear to look anymore, a cold silhouette descended from a Sword Condor like a bolt of lightning. The person that descended to the ground had a cold face as she held onto the sword directed at Lin Yun.

When Ye Liuyun raised his head to look at the newcomer, he saw Xin Yan looking at him coldly. He instantly calmed down and a trace of horror flashed through his eyes. He immediately abandoned his sword without a second thought and tried to leave.

But he was too late. Xin Yan shattered Ye Liuyun’s sword, causing the sword to vibrate and forcing Ye Liuyun to take more than ten steps back in order to stabilize himself. However, she wasn’t finished with just that. Xin Yan suddenly waved her sleeve and charged forward like a bolt of lightning.

With just a simple stretch of her hand, she grabbed onto Ye Liuyun’s neck. Ye Liuyun was suffocating from Xin Yan’s grip, he couldn’t break from no matter how much he struggled. At this moment, Xin Yan’s slender figure looked overly domineering.

At this moment, Wang Yan walked out from the crowd and clapped. He smiled and said, “How awe-inspiring, Senior Sister Xin Yan. You broke the Hundred Alliance-Union Agreement for a rookie.”

His words made Xin Yan’s face change slightly. She stretched her hand out and threw Ye Liuyun away. When Ye Liuyun landed on the ground, he breathed a heavy sigh of relief, but his eyes flooded with guilt as he looked at Wang Yan. After all, he failed to complete the task given to him by Wang Yan. Not only that, but the twelve elites that he brought over even had their sword intent destroyed.

A crowd immediately started to gather behind Xin Yan. They were naturally members of Locket Mountain. In that split second, the Locket Mountain and Gentlemen Union faced off under the tense atmosphere.

“Big Brother, are you alright?” Li Wuyou jumped off the Dragon Blooded Horse and helped Lin Yun up.

Lin Yun’s face was pale and the sword intent in his wound was terrifying. The sword that stabbed him missed his heart by two inches. He nearly died just now.

“That bastard! He tried to kill you!” Li Wuyou lost it. He rushed over immediately when he heard that Lin Yun was being hunted.

Taking out a pill and swallowing it, Lin Yun replied, “I won’t be dying anytime soon.”

He then locked his brows. He had a bad premonition when he looked at the smile on Wang Yan’s face. Did Senior Sister Xin Yan break some sort of agreement by helping me?

“The Hundred Alliance-Union Agreement is a blood oath between all the alliance-unions. Xin Yan, you should remember what it is about…” Wang Yan sneered while looking at Xin Yan.

The Hundred Alliance-Union Agreement? The expression of the surrounding disciples changed. They shook their heads inwardly when they recalled the scene earlier.

“Wuyou, hurry up and ask about the Hundred Alliance-Union Agreement!” Lin Yun immediately instructed.

Not long after, Li Wuyou returned with a panic look. He replied, “Big Brother, the Hundred Alliance-Union Agreement is a blood oath issued by the top hundred strongest alliance-unions. Competition is allowed, but someone in the Earth Ranking must not act against someone from the Mortal Ranking. Otherwise, they are in violation of the blood oath!”

Lin Yun felt a huge shock in his heart. He tried his best to calm down and asked, “What will happen if the blood oath is violated?”

“Those who violate the blood oath must either abolish their cultivation or compensate a hundred thousand first grade spiritual jades. Otherwise, all the alliance-unions will initiate a siege on the alliance-union that violated the blood oath,” Li Wuyou replied with an ugly face.

The Hundred Alliance-Union Agreement was initially established out of goodwill. It was so that those from the Earth Ranking wouldn’t bully disciples of the Mortal Ranking. It was also to avoid the expansion of conflicts between alliance-unions.

And now, Wang Yan had something against Xin Yan. The Gentlemen Union and Locket Mountain had been fighting for years and they were mortal enemies. Under the present conditions, the atmosphere between the two factions grew even more intense.

“You have two options, make your pick,” said Wang Yan.

Gnashing her teeth, Xin Yan replied, “Wang Yan, you’re despicable! You’re hiding behind the scenes while watching someone from your alliance-union try to kill a fellow disciple!”

“So what? If he has violated the taboo and committed a murder, the sect will punish him. But even so, I will compensate his clan for his loss!” Wang Yan smiled. “Furthermore, isn’t that brat still alive and kicking? Ye Liuyun, were you trying to kill Lin Yun earlier?”

“Of course not. Who doesn’t know that I, Ye Liuyun, is someone ranked 36th on the Mortal Ranking? I wouldn’t have chased him around if I wanted to kill him. I only wanted to teach him a lesson,” Ye Liuyun smiled. He instantly got the meaning behind Wang Yan’s words.

“Hear that? If you were unhappy with Ye Liuyun, you could have gotten elites from Locket Mountain to make their move and I wouldn’t have said anything about it…” Wang Yan sneered coldly. “But don’t blame me since you’ve personally taken matters into your own hands. Either cripple your cultivation or provide a hundred thousand spiritual jades as compensation. If you don’t do this, I will convene a meeting between the hundred alliance-union immediately!”

All the disciples from Locket Mountain wore an unsightly expression when they heard those words. Xin Yan responded out of urgency and had placed the Locket Mountain in a disadvantageous position.

“Senior Sister, let’s fight it out with them! These people are clearly trying to bully our rookie here!”

“Even if we concede today, they will still find ways to make things difficult for us in the future!”

“There are no good people in the Gentlemen Union!”

The disciples of Locket Mountain immediately took their stance. They did not want Xin Yan to be placed in a difficult position, even if the situation wasn’t advantageous to them.

Waving her hand, Xin Yan looked at Wang Yan, “You know that I can’t agree to those terms. Speak, what do you really want!”

“Well, I’m not an unreasonable person.” A cold light flashed in Wang Yan’s eyes and he revealed his true intention. “The grudges between disciples of the Mortal Ranking will be settled among themselves. Lin Yun and Ye Liuyun’s battle isn’t over. A month from now, the two of them will continue their battle on the Life-Death Stage!”

Killing a fellow disciple was forbidden in the sect, but there were places to resolve grudges. Once disciples stood on the Life-Death Stage, only the winner would live.

Everyone’s faces changed when they heard that. After all, it was too much. Lin Yun was only a rookie who had just made his breakthrough into the Profound Martial Realm. So how could he possibly contend with Ye Liuyun who was in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm and 36th on the Mortal Ranking?

If Lin Yun went up against Ye Liuyun, it would spell certain death. This was Wang Yan’s scheme because he knew that he couldn’t kill Lin Yun through normal means in the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

Even if Xin Yan didn’t stop Ye Liuyun earlier, there was no way Ye Liuyun would lose his mind and kill Lin Yun. After all, how could he possibly sacrifice his future just to kill someone? If Wang Yan had forced this order upon Ye Liuyun, no one in the Gentlemen Union would follow him in the future.

So Wang Yan pondered and felt that destroying Lin Yun’s sword intent in the Myriad Sword Painting was the best choice. However, it was unfortunate that Ye Liuyun failed. But just when Wang Yan thought that he had to wait for another opportunity, Xin Yan delivered this opportunity right to him. Now, he could force Lin Yun on the Life-Death Stage.

“Get lost!” However, Xin Yan cursed at him unexpectedly, “You can go ahead and convene a meeting. I’ll see how many people will try to touch the Locket Mountain after knowing that I violated the blood oath to save someone!”

So she’s not playing by the rules? Wang Yan cursed inwardly because of this mad woman. With a grim smile, he furiously replied, “Alright then! In the future, my Gentlemen Union will also not abide by the blood oath. So your Locket Mountain better watch out!”

The moment he spoke those words, an uproar was incited and everyone’s faces changed drastically. This matter was developing towards war. The Gentlemen Union and Locket Mountain were top alliance-unions in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. If a war broke out between them, it would surely raise a storm. There would be no way to stop it unless a Sword-Bearing Elder showed up.

“Let me return those words to you. We’ll see!” Xin Yan replied coldly.

“Senior Sister, I accept his suggestion.” But right at this moment, a youth holding his chest calmly stepped up. That person was naturally Lin Yun. He stood out just as war was about to break out between the two alliance-unions. This was something that no one had expected.

A cold look flashed in Wang Yan’s eyes when Lin Yun said this. He immediately gave Ye Liuyun a signal. He only wanted Lin Yun’s life, so if possible, he did not want to start a war with the Locket Mountain. This was the best course of action, especially since Lin Yun was now courting death.

“All the fellow disciples here can testify for me. I, Ye Liuyun, an outer disciple of the Sword Firmament Pavilion have a grudge against Lin Yun. I hereby issue a challenge on the Life-Death Stage one month from now!” Ye Liuyun bit on his finger and dripped his blood on his Sword Firmament Token before throwing it towards Lin Yun.

However, Xin Yan intervened and grabbed onto the challenge token. Turning around, she questioned coldly, “Are you insane? Are you trying to die here? Or have you lived enough?”

Lin Yun looked at Xin Yan’s hand that held the challenge token. Blood was dripping from her palm. She was wounded from when she grabbed Ye Liuyun’s sword with her bare hands.

“Senior Sister, there’s no way you can take care of me for the rest of my life. I will naturally take responsibility for this matter since I’m the cause of it. There’s no need to implicate the entire Locket Mountain just because of me.” Lin Yun knew that there was no way Wang Yan would let him off after killing Wang Ning and today’s humiliation was just the beginning.

“Furthermore, are you certain that I’ll be weaker than him after a month?” Lin Yun’s blood boiled and he smiled, “Or do you also think that I’m a piece of trash as he said?”

Even if Ye Liuyun did not issue the challenge today, Lin Yun would still return today’s humiliation no matter what. Did these people really think that he was a pushover? If that was the case, then they must be dreaming!

Xin Yan was briefly stunned by Lin Yun’s words. He took this opportunity to snatch the challenge token away before she could react. Placing it against his Sword Firmament Token, he said, “The Life-Death Stage one month from now!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The disciples of the Locket Mountain were surprised when they heard those words. Lin Yun had just joined the Sword Firmament Pavilion. One month ago, he was still at Herbal Peak. Now, in just one month, he would be facing Ye Liuyun, the 36th place on the Mortal Ranking, on the Life-Death Stage.

Even the other disciples in the surrounding were also shocked by this scene. To them, Lin Yun was courting death.
