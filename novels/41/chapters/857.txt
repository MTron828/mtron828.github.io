Chapter 858 - Forcibly Getting Through The Stage!

At the peak of the Profound Amber Mountain, the Sacred Alliance’s elders watched Lin Yun shatter the bronze gate.

“This lad from the Ancient Southern Domain seems to be in trouble,” smiled the Mountain Western Domain’s elder, Chang Hai.

“Indeed. Those three seem to have heard of Lin Yun and plan to gang up on him.”

“Who would dare to underestimate him when he grasped the spiritual sword intent?”

“This fellow is the one who relied on himself to bring the Ancient Southern Domain to the level of the other domains? If it was in the past, no one would pay attention to the champion of the Ancient Southern Domain.”

“This is good news. Let him get eliminated first to save others from trouble.” The elders from the three realms naturally didn’t stand on Lin Yun’s side. When Qing Tu saw this, he became nervous. If Lin Yun was eliminated, the entire Ancient Southern Domain might be annihilated.

The ancient hall was illuminated with pearls on the ceiling, which made the ceiling look like a boundless starry sky. The atmosphere in the hall was weird as three people looked at Lin Yun with cold eyes.

A brief moment later, the blue-clothed youth from Mountain Western Domain spoke out, “You’re Lin Yun? There are many rumors about you in Lonesky City. You’re the first person to grasp the spiritual sword intent before reaching Heavenly Soul Realm in a few thousand years. I’ve heard about your name for a while now.”

When the youth spoke, Lin Yun instantly understood that the three of them were going to gang up on him. With an indifferent expression on his face, Lin Yun responded, “Cut the crap. Since the three of you want to gang up on me, tell me your names. I don’t cut down nameless people!”

The three of them were briefly stunned because they never expected that Lin Yun would be so decisive.

“Hehe. Brother, you’re a really straightforward person. I’m ranked fifth in the Mountain Western Domain. My name is Shangguan Qinghong!” The blue-clothed youth grinned.

“Fourth in the Mound Northern Domain, Guan Lie!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Third in the Gauze Eastern Domain, Zhao Yu!” The one who spoke last had an eerie tone filled with killing intent. It turned out that none of the Gauze Eastern Domain’s geniuses were pushovers.

If this was the past, the three of them would be more than enough to sweep through all the geniuses from the Ancient Southern Domain. However, the three of them were acting uncharacteristically cautious and chose to join hands. After all, the rumors about Lin Yun were so great that they had to play it safe.

Shangguan Qinghong’s face turned dark before he spoke with a confident smile, “Lin Yun, you have no chance with the three of us working together. Even if your spiritual sword intent is strong, you have no advantage against us. You should give up so we don’t have to injure you heavily.”

Lin Yun smiled at their cold gazes, “Sorry about the misunderstanding. I don’t need to use my spiritual sword intent to deal with the three of you. If you guys can’t defeat me within ten moves, you guys will lose your chance to win.”

“What arrogance!” Their faces changed as they unleashed their violent origin energy. Drawing their weapons, they instantly surrounded Lin Yun and executed their strongest attacks.

Their attacks were so strong that space was being torn into pieces. The commotion echoed out and roared throughout the hall.

Lin Yun was impressed by their strength. His eyes glowed and he could see all of their individuals strengths. All three of them were slightly stronger than Yu Haotian after he came out of the Dragoncloud Treasury. However, that wasn’t enough to defeat him.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun barked. He stood strong as he glowed with azure-purple radiance. At this moment, he was circulating his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra and Iris Sword Sutra at the same time. In the next second, two brilliant sword rays enveloped him as his terrifying sword aura spread out.

Clenching his fist, a dragon manifested around his arm that glowed with azure-purple radiance. Soon after, lightning crackled and a powerful wind roared. His punch was like a sword that contained phenomenons of three different attributes.

Facing Lin Yun’s attack, the trio lasted for a brief moment before their attacks started to crack. Lin Yun’s power was more violent than they had imagined. When their attacks collapsed, their faces became grave and they instantly retreated. When they landed on the ground, they wore grave expressions because they never expected Lin Yun’s origin energy to be so massive.

“Third place, fourth place, and fifth place… what a bunch of weaklings!” Lin Yun said coldly as he examined all three of them.

“Damn it! Country bumpkin from the Ancient Southern Domain, there’s no place for you to be arrogant here!”

“Don’t hold back anymore. Let’s go!” The three of their faces became nasty as they brought out their full strength.

“Starbreaking Sword!” Shangguan Qinghong attacked first as the sword in his hand started to buzz. A dazzling cold light shined from the tip of his sword, which made the air in the hall become slow. Shangguan Qinghong had a brilliant sword with powerful intent that even distorted the surrounding water.

Guan Lie wielded a sinister longsword and pushed his cloud intent to the limit. He was nearly at the spiritual sword intent level and it felt like he could tear the sky in two. As for Zhao Yu, he emitted black demonic radiance as his muscles started to squirm. Clearly, the pressure coming from his physique began to grow, which meant that he grasped a powerful physique technique.

“Overlord Sword–Tai’a Slash!” Lin Yun appeared in front of Shangguan Qinghong. Using two of his fingers as a sword, he slashed the air. In the next second, Shangguan Qinghong’s sword aura instantly shattered. Lin Yun didn’t stop there and tapped his finger out, piercing Shangguan Qinghong’s chest with sword aura. Throwing up a mouthful of blood, Shangguan Qinghong went flying.

“Cloud Berserk Slash!” Just as Lin Yun pushed Shangguan Qinghong back, Guan Lie charged over. He wasn’t about to let Lin Yun catch his breath. Then, his blade nearly cut the sky in two as his sword ray tried to devour Lin Yun like a ferocious dragon.

Flicking Divine Finger—Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword!

Lin Yun’s fingers radiated brightly as he unleashed a sword ray to stop the terrifying blade. In the next second, an earth-shattering explosion echoed out in the hall like rumbling lightning.

“H-h-how is this possible?!” Guan Lie was shocked by this scene.

Flicking Divine Finger—Graceful Moment, Absolute Hit!

Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with Guan Lie as he pointed his fingers out. The Iris Flower petals behind him gathered and formed a massive flower array. A sword ray containing wind and lightning energies flew out and pinned Guan Lie to a wall.

“Demonlight Battle Physique!” Zhao Yu roared. As a demonic glow flowed through his body, his body began to swell and emit an immense pressure.

“Pitiful tricks!” Lin Yun twisted his body in the air and circulated the Azure Dragon Battle Physique. Nearly a hundred dragon runes squirmed on his body to form an ominous primordial beast. When he turned around, his body had turned into a ferocious dragon.

Reaching out with his palm, an azure dragon claw flew out at Zhao Yu’s body. In the next second, Zhao Yu smashed into the ground and created a huge crater. The intense pain made him howl out in pain as his bones nearly shattered.

In barely five moves, Lin Yun had defeated all three of them. This scene shocked the elders at the top of the Profound Amber Mountain. They were so shocked that they jaws were practically touching the floor. The casual smiles that they once had were now frozen.

Qing Tu’s face also changed because he had witnessed Lin Yun’s new strength. He never expected that Lin Yun would digest all of his harvest from the banquet and become so strong with just two months of seclusion.

“Looks like we’ve overestimated you guys. I don’t even need to bring out my sword, not to mention my spiritual sword intent,” said Lin Yun as he looked at the losers coldly.

The three of them were in a pathetic state and none of them dared to utter a word. Reluctance filled their eyes because they were famous figures back in their domains. Even worse, they never placed anyone in the Ancient Southern Domain in their eyes. They weren’t even afraid of Lin Yun when they heard that Lin Yun grasped the spiritual sword intent. Who would have thought that they would lose with all three of them working together?

“You won.” A brief moment later, each of them threw keys at Lin Yun. Like Lin Yun, they also obtained a key when they shattered the bronze gate. When Lin Yun combined the four keys, he created a complete key that would unlock the next stage.
