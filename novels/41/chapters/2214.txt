Chapter 2215: Senior Brother Is Depressed

“Junior Brother, it’s not a good habit to keep doing this,” Ye Guhan said with resentment as he chewed on the Divine Dragon Fruit.

“I got it,” Lin Yun smiled.

Ye Guhan slowly walked into the Iris Secret Realm and said, “You’re talented, blessed with opportunities, handsome, and even your inheritance is terrifying. Someone like you would be beaten to death if you were in my era.”

“I don’t think it would be that unbelievable. After all, I’m quite humble,” Lin Yun smiled embarrassedly.

“If it wasn’t because you’re my junior brother, do you believe that I also want to beat you?” Ye Guhan glared at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly, but had nothing to say.

After recollecting himself, Ye Guhan smiled, “Go on, what do you want from me this time?”

“I’d like to ask Senior Brother about the stages of a Saint Lord along with how to deal with a Saint,” Lin Yun asked.

“You… You…” Ye Guhan’s lips twitched, and he couldn’t contain himself any longer.

“Too much?” Lin Yun asked.

Ye Guhan rolled his eyes, “It’s good that you know you’re too much. Which Saint hasn’t cultivate for a few hundred years? They would reach the Saint Realm with great difficulty, and you want to face Saints while you’re only at the Quasi-Saint Realm? You call yourself humble? Well, those with a better talent, powerful sect, and better fortune could only become saints after a hundred years, and they’re already considered monstrous geniuses. You’re only twenty-five this year, and talk about killing Saints?”

Lin Yun smiled and realized that it really seemed like it. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Guhan continued, “I’m already unfathomable, and I can probably anger many seniors to death.”

“Senior Brother, you’re too humble,” Lin Yun smiled.

After Ye Guhan was done, he explained to Lin Yun as they sat beneath the Phoenix Tree. He said, “The Saint Lord is divided into nine stages: the Saint Energy, Dipper Aura, Yin-Yang, Spiritual Sea, Union, Golden Pill, Elemental, Profound Yellow, and Heavenly Seat.”

There were nine stages in the Saint Lord, and each should be a great transformation in strength, judging from their names, and this wasn’t just the first and second stages.

“Is there a lot?” Ye Guhan smiled. “It might not be that much to you. After all, you’ve walked through a Quasi-Saint’s journey in just one year. The natural laws in the world are changing, and it’s easier to comprehend saint daos now. In my era, it was impressive if one could become a Saint at a hundred years old.”

Lin Yun asked, “What stage was the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord in?”

“He’s at the second stage, Dipper Aura,” Ye Guhan said as he opened up his palm with the spiritual energy in this secret realm surging over, swiftly condensing into saint energy in his palm. He explained, “This is the first stage of the Saint Lord, which is to condense your saint aura into saint energy. The saint energy is ten times stronger than the saint aura.

“Converting the saint energy to dipper aura isn’t that easy, and it’s not accurate to call it cultivating but a transformation.” Ye Guhan continued, “After it completes the transformation, you must fuse your saint dao into it and reach a balance. The moment you succeed, the dipper aura will become powerful, and you will have to sever a Saint’s connection with heaven and earth if you want to break it, preventing that Saint Lord from forming a connection with heaven and earth.”

Lin Yun finally understood why he couldn’t piece through the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord’s dipper aura. It might look like an energy barrier, but it was actually a connection with heaven and earth. The saint daos would be like threads coiling around the body.

“Logically speaking, the Astral Sword Intent should be able to cut through dipper aura, not to mention that I even used the Great Profound Sword Array and multiplied my sword intent by three times,” Lin Yun asked in confusion.

“Do you think wood can smash apart a metal shield after thickening it by three times?” Ye Guhan asked.

“This…” Lin Yun fell into deep thought. But he felt that something wasn’t right somewhere, and he asked, “But I can feel that the Astral Sword Intent is powerful. If a Saint Lord uses it, it should be able to pierce through dipper aura.”

As Lin Yun spoke, the doubts in his eyes became firm and unwavering. This was his intuition as a swordsman, and Lin Yun believed in himself.

“Drawing the galaxies from beyond the thirty-sixth layer of heaven through the dream.” Ye Guhan sighed. “Your feeling is right. Even without the Great Profound Sword Canon, the Astral Sword Intent at greater mastery can pierce through a Saint Lord’s dipper aura, but only in the hands of a Saint, unlike you.

“So, where’s the problem? Think about it carefully.” Ye Guhan took out another Divine Dragon Fruit and began chewing on it. He wanted to wait till Lin Yun became anxious and begged him for an answer. After all, he still needed prestige as the senior brother.

Lin Yun smiled, “Actually, I have more or less thought it through. Is it because of Saint Dao? Saint Lords who have grasped the Astral Sword Intent would most likely grasp Sword Dao to easily break through the dipper aura. But I’m an exception who grasped the Astral Sword Intent and not the Saint Dao, which is why it felt weird. Is that it?”

Before Ye Guhan could chew on the fruit, he was stumped and couldn’t speak. Lin Yun didn’t need his teachings at all; it looked like he had gone too easy on Lin Yun, so he needed to teach him a lesson. He lowered the Divine Dragon Fruit and praised with a smile, “Junior Brother, not bad!”

When Lin Yun saw the smile on Ye Guhan’s face, he had a bad feeling about it, so he said, “I’m just guessing it randomly. I still need Senior Brother’s teachings.”

“Alright!” Ye Guhan smiled. “Didn’t you want to challenge a Saint? I’ll satisfy your request.”

“Really?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up.

“That’s for sure. After all, you’re my beloved junior brother,” Ye Guhan smiled warmly.

“Saint Dao?” Lin Yun asked.

“There’s no need to hurry,” Ye Guhan replied. “Sword Dao is a Sovereign Dao, and you can grasp it quickly with no bottleneck. It’s hard for others, but you can easily grasp it.”

“It’s not that unbelievable,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Junior Brother, you are worthy of my praise. Saint Dao is nothing for you,” Ye Guhan smiled. He continued, “Let me explain the stages of a Saint Lord to you.”

Ye Guhan would demonstrate it as he explained the nine stages of a Saint Lord. Each stage greatly boosted strength, like the transformation from saint energy to dipper aura. After reaching the third stage, it would become more powerful since one could manifest the Yin-Yang Millstone, absorbing spiritual energy from the sun and moon. At that time, the speed of cultivation would skyrocket.

At the Spiritual Sea Stage, one could directly absorb spiritual energy from the stars, in addition to the sun and moon from the previous stage. The strength would undergo a drastic transformation, and the saint energy would be terrifying.

As for the Union Stage, one would have to fuse all the saint daos into the saint origin, allowing the saint origin to transform. The Golden Pill Stage was above the Union Stage and it would transform the saint origin into a golden pill. The moment the golden pill was formed, one wouldn’t have to worry about the exhaustion of saint aura since it would burn like a cauldron. As for the Elemental, Profound Yellow, and Heavenly Seat Stages, Ye Guhan also explained them.

“Nine stages, so that’s the cultivation of the Saint Realm?” Lin Yun frowned and muttered, “It feels like a whole new world, and I wonder how long it will take to complete the journey.”

Chewing on a Divine Dragon Fruit, Ye Guhan patted Lin Yun’s shoulder with a smile, “Even before the spiritual energy in the world has changed, it wouldn’t take long for you, not to mention we’re in a prosperous era now. You’ll finish the journey in three to five years. Alright, I won’t bother you anymore, and I’ll try and help you challenge Saints.”

“Thank you, Senior Brother,” Lin Yun smiled.

When Ye Guhan left Indigothunder Peak, he shared his thoughts with the Dragon Origin Great Saint, Serene Dust Great Saint, and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

The Serene Dust Great Saint couldn’t help saying, “Isn’t that too dangerous? He will die if he can’t withstand it. He’s only at the Quasi-Saint Realm, so there’s no need to hurry.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint doubtfully looked at Ye Guhan, and said, “You’re not trying to take revenge on him, right? Even someone made of metal won’t make it through this regimen.”

The reason why Ye Guhan called the three Great Saints over was to prepare a training regimen for Lin Yun. If it was a normal training regimen, the two Great Saints wouldn’t have such a response. This was because Ye Guhan’s training regimen was a little too extreme.

Ye Guhan explained, “His identity has been disclosed, and it’s hard for him to transform without being tempered. Not to mention, this was something he suggested, and he wanted to find a way to fight Saints.”

Everyone took a deep breath since challenging Saints as a Quasi-Saint was a little too unbelieveable.

“Let’s put him in Blood Purgatory Mountain,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, who had kept silent, spoke up.

“Blood Purgatory Mountain?!” Ye Guhan’s face changed upon hearing that because that was a little too much.

“A jade has to be polished. Long Yun will be responsible for the physique, Jing Chen will be responsible for the Sovereign Dragon Fist, and I will be responsible for sword techniques.” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint briefly paused, before she looked at Ye Guhan and said, “Aside from teaching him the Great Profound Sword Canon, you have to let him familiarize himself with the Profound Sky Canon. To have four Great Saints teaching him, it should be able to satisfy him.”

The three Great Saints silently looked at the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. Ye Guhan bitterly smiled because he really couldn’t be blamed for this.

Back at Indigothunder Peak, Lin Yun still had no idea that his senior brother was preparing a devil training regimen for him, not to mention the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint gave this training regimen a boost.

Blood Purgatory Mountain was a forbidden ground that even the faces of Saints would change once they heard about it.

Lin Yun left Indigothunder Peak and came to Celestial Purging Mountain. When he came over to the pavilion, the Crane Fairy quietly stood beside a zither, which surprised Lin Yun. Could it be that Senior Tian Xing is still around?

He quickened his steps and came over to the pavilion, but he was disappointed when he saw the person in the pavilion. This person who was playing the zither wasn’t Tian Xing but the Dao Yang Holy Son.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re here.” The Dao Yang Holy Son smiled. He still preferred addressing Lin Yun as Ye Qingtian.

“Hehe, you look better this way.” The Crane Fairy gave Lin Yun a wink.

Their emotions reduced the sorrow in his heart. At the very least, there was still zither music here, and the Crane Fairy was still smiling.
