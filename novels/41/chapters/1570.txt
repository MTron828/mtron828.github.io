Chapter 1571 - The Saint Sword Belongs To Me, Any Objections? (1)

After reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, the screen in the sky of Lin Yun’s violet palace disappeared along with the ten stars. Out of his fifty thousand-foot wide astral energy ocean, forty thousand feet had been converted into dragon origin.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After a brief examination, Lin Yun discovered that the power of dragon origin was ten times greater than astral energy. Aside from that, his physique had also gotten stronger. After all, his body would transform whenever a dragon pulse was formed.

The first pulse would transform the skin, the second pulse would strengthen the muscles, the third pulse would strengthen the vitality, the fourth pulse would strengthen the bones, the fifth pulse would strengthen the meridians, the sixth pulse would strengthen the internal organs, the seventh pulse would allow the cultivator to be immune to poison, the eighth pulse would enable one to be unharmed by flames or ice, and the ninth pulse was a thorough transformation of the body.

Upon reaching the ninth pulse, one could form the Divine Dragon Golden Physique, significantly boosting the physique and obtaining power comparable to divine dragons. Each of the nine transformations would bring great changes to the physique; however, it wasn’t that obvious for the first and second pulses.

But after the transformation of the vitality at the third pulse, the cultivator’s vitality would be no different from a beast, putting a difference between them and ordinary people. After stepping into the Dragon Pulse Realm, one could see the path towards being a saint.

Further ahead would be nirvana, which meant that the cultivator was half a step onto the saint path. But most people would stop at the Dragon Pulse Realm because the forming of each pulse meant that the cultivator had to undergo a tribulation.

They would only transform if they made it through the tribulation. If one failed, one would die, and no one dared to take risks. This meant that the later pulses were increasingly more challenging. If the cultivator was too old, they would have no odds of winning.

“Is converting 80% into dragon origin very strong?” Lin Yun asked, looking at the dragon origin condensed in his palm.

“That’s for sure! Furthermore, your dragon pulse has probably reached eight feet, and that’s heaven-defying.” Lil’ Purple said.

“Let me give it a try.” Lin Yun said as he clasped his palms together to circulate the dragon pulse within his body. When a dragon reaching eight feet appeared behind him, Lin Yun could feel his dragon origin boiling when he breathed.

When he circulated the dragon pulse, Lin Yun was shocked to discover that his speed of absorbing the divine dragon spiritual liquid was nearly comparable to when he used the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron. Aside from that, he could also sense that it was easier for him to control the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron with the Netherflower.

He had already reached the fifth stage in the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, and this cultivation technique was limited when he was in the Elysium Core Realm. Now that he circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra with dragon origin, the power of this cultivation technique was strengthened by at least 30%.

When he tried circulating the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron with his dragon origin, his dragon origin started boiling, and a sword vibration echoed from within his body.

“What power!” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, sensing the tremendous boost in his strength. In reality, he should’ve long made a breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm. After all, his cultivation was limiting his cultivation technique, sword technique, movement technique, and even the Golden Crow Wings. He couldn’t completely unleash their full power without reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm.

After all, the Golden Crow Wings had twenty thousand saint runes, and the core even contained the Golden Crow Divine Rune. The Southern Emperor left behind the Carefree 9 Swords, and his movement technique had reached a terrifying height. Because his cultivation limited him, it was like having a small horse dragging a massive carriage. But that burden had completely disappeared now after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“It’s time for us to go out now, right?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“No rush. I want to convert all my astral energy into dragon origin first.” Lin Yun replied.

“Are you insane? The divine dragon spiritual liquid won’t help after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm. So you’ll only be wasting your time!” Lil’ Purple urged. “Furthermore, didn’t you sense the treasures flying out from the pool? Outside is probably in chaos now.”

“That is precisely why I can’t go out now.” Lin Yun had considered it well. There would be no meaning in him going out now because he didn’t have the strength to suppress everyone. Since that was the case, he might as well become as strong as he could before going out.

“You’ve belittled the last 20%. When you’re done converting, everything will already be too late.” Lil’ Purple said. She felt that it was too unrealistic for Lin Yun to achieve that.

“I plan to undo another seal of the Profound Wither Key.”

Lil’ Purple was briefly stunned and asked, “Is it worth it?”

“I did it once for An Liuyan. So why isn’t it worth it for the Sword Sect?” Lin Yun had made this decision long ago. He began to form seals with both of his hands to undo the third sealing layer on the Profound Wither Key.

Meanwhile, as Lil' Purple had said, the outside world was in chaos. The temptation of the Divine Dragon Artifacts was too great, and every single one was incredibly valuable. If there was a Samsara Edict Realm expert there, even they might not be able to resist the temptation of those artifacts.

After all, even if they couldn’t use them, they could give them to the sect they belonged to in exchange for astronomical resources. That’s why everyone who was participating in the competition had even brought out their constellations without holding back. Even so, the chaos still had no signs of ending.

Even if someone managed to obtain an artifact, they would immediately be besieged by the experts from the other sects, and they would be heavily injured if they weren’t careful.

The young lord of the Heavenly Pool Manor was dumbfounded while looking at this scene, and it had been a long time since the Heavenly Pool Gathering became so chaotic.

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord didn’t say a word, but had his brows furrowed. This was because he also didn’t expect this scene. There were too many Divine Dragon Artifacts this time around, causing all the sects to stand out. In the past, a high-grade saint artifact would be rare enough.

There were three high-grade saint artifacts this time, and even he was tempted to snatch that white sword, not to mention the leaders from the various sects. It was expected that no one would want to give up on it.

“The Profound Sky Sect is too strong!” Pei Qian said. Aside from Luo Yuan, the two Dragon Pulse Realm disciples beside him were also strong, obtaining a few of the Divine Dragon Artifacts. Moreover, their means were ruthless. They were both disciples of the Inner Ranking in the Profound Sky Sect. The Profound Sky Sect’s Inner Ranking was similar to the Sword Sect’s Heaven Ranking, and it wasn’t easy to make it onto the ranking.

The two were ganging up on the Sword Sect’s disciples. The Sword Sect’s disciples managed to obtain one of the high-grade saint artifact, the Saint Dragon War Flag, but they were immediately facing immense pressure the next moment.
