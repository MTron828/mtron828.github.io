Chapter 754 - Spiritual Sword Intent

Lin Yun had to admit that the immortal sword intent at Falling Dragon Slope was a great opportunity. But opportunities were reserved for those who were prepared. Countless people had observed the sword intent before, but only Lin Yun had a harvest.

Lin Yun also observed it two months ago, but his only reaction was shock and surprise. As for Murong Qing, he wanted to use this place to nurture an Imperial Sword Herb, but he unluckily ran into Lin Yun and the herb was ruined.

Then again, neither Murong Qing nor the Heavenly Soul Realm expert managed to observe sword intent being transformed. Otherwise, they would have had a great opportunity. Lin Yun instantly determined that it must have something to do with his quasi-spiritual sword intent.

If he didn’t bring his sword intent to quasi-spiritual sword intent, he would probably gain nothing from this trip. If his strength wasn’t enough, there was nothing the immortal sword intent would show him. For example, Lin Yun was able to the spiritual sword intent, but bled from his eyes when it transcends the spiritual sword intent.

As time passed, Lin Yun’s improvement was swift. Five days later, dozens of fireflies manifested from his sword intent and could exist for two days without extinguishing. This was terrifying as ordinary geniuses could only let their sword intent exist for half an hour. For monstrous geniuses like Bai Lixuan and Nangong Wanyu, they could only manage to do this for half a day.

But Lin Yun could last for two days with the quasi-spiritual sword intent. When he fought, he would be able to leave his sword intent in his opponent’s body, dealing continuous damage. If they wanted to get rid of it, they would have to spend a lot of origin energy and time. This made him wonder how powerful igniting his sword intent in his opponent’s body would be.

“I still needed guidance or else I wouldn’t have come this far.” Lin Yun muttered to himself as he looked at the sword intent on the mountain. In the past, there was no progress no matter how hard he tried. But after observing the sword intent at Falling Dragon Slope, it felt like nothing could stop his progress.

“This is a mysterious state. I’ll be able to make a breakthrough into the spiritual sword intent in half a month.” Lin Yun could feel that his path would be smooth and that the spiritual sword intent would soon appear.

As time passed quickly, Lin Yun continued to comprehend the spiritual sword intent while the geniuses back at Swordmire City were fighting for an opportunity to make a breakthrough. Even the three kings and seven elites rushed over from afar.

With the Draconic Banquet approaching, everyone was trying their best to make a breakthrough and become stronger. After all, no one knew what kind of underdog would appear at the Draconic Banquet and no one was sure that they would reach the end.

Not everyone knew that a new era was coming, but they all had a vague feeling about it with a beast tide of this scale as a sign. This was also a big reason why no one was certain for the Draconic Banquet. So, they were all doing their best to prepare for the finals so they wouldn’t have any regrets.

Ten days later, a terrifying sword intent appeared at the Falling Dragon Slope that soared into the sky, tearing a huge hole in the clouds. This allowed a hundred stars to shine on the ground and fall onto Lin Yun. In that split second, Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind as he emitted a glow in which he looked sacred. But this phenomenon lasted for a split second before the sky returned to normal.

“Spiritual sword intent!” Lin Yun opened his eyes as his temperament had undergone a drastic transformation and could easily pierce through the sky. If he looked at someone right now, he could shatter the other party’s heart even without moving a finger.

Lin Yun rejoiced, but he soon calmed down because he knew that he definitely wouldn’t be able to control it well as he had just made his breakthrough. So, he needed time to get used to it. But suddenly, a crack rang out from within his body and his heart jolted. Could it be that another Primordial Ominous Soul was going to awaken?

Lin Yun quickly shut his eyes and examined his body. It was just as he had expected. The two Primordial Ominous Souls - Qiongqi and Aurora Dragon - moved a little to make way for the newcomer. Simultaneously, the ‘broken sword’ within his body was pulled out a little more as its sword ray radiated in the space within his body.

Lin Yun was able to realize this time that the Primordial Ominous Soul was a snake that looked like the legendary Flying Serpent. It was black, covered with eerie scales, and had a chilling gaze. When the sword ray dissipated, the Flying Serpent disappeared. If he didn’t look carefully, he also wouldn’t notice the existence of the Flying Serpent.

Lin Yun pulled himself out from the space and wore a weird expression. After all, it was weird that the sword would get pulled out little by litte whenever he made a breakthrough in his cultivation. According to his estimation, the sword would completely show itself when all eight shackles broke.

In the past, he was still under the perception that the sword had sealed the Primordial Ominous Souls. But now, it seemed like the Primordial Ominous Souls were sealing the sword. Could it be that the sword was stronger than all eight Primordial Ominous Souls? Then again, he would only know this after all eight Primordial Ominous Souls awakened.

“Perhaps it wasn’t an accident that I came to this world?” Lin Yun muttered and continued, “Perhaps this ‘new era’ will give me an answer. For now, I need to focus on my spiritual sword intent.”

Lin Yun could sense that his sword intent had undergone a transformation that would strengthen his sword technique greatly. Sword intent itself was vague and invisible, but it was real. But spiritual sword intent was different as it wasn’t that vague anymore. On the contrary, it looked like it had life.

When he touched it, he could feel the excitement of his sword intent. The feeling couldn’t be described with words, but he could sense it clearly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Xiantian sword intent is invisible, but spiritual sword intent has life.” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up. However, he knew that it was still far from perfect. “My spiritual sword intent should just be in the initial mastery, so I still have some ways to go before reaching lesser mastery…”

After all, he saw the sky getting torn apart with starlight falling down on him. But he only counted one hundred stars. Once he reached a deeper realm, he would be able to condense the stars into vortexes. But when he started cultivating, he was shocked because he never expected that his spiritual sword intent would be so powerful. It had brought his comprehension in sword intent to an unbelievable height.

In just one breath, he fused the fifth and sixth form of the Overlord Sword together and comprehended them instantly. The parts that he had difficulty became clear, which felt unbelievable.

Although he encountered some issues when trying to combine the fifth and sixth forms into Supreme Dominance, he succeeded after ten tries thanks to the spiritual sword intent. As for Terranean Destruction, Lin Yun could sense many flaws that he couldn’t comprehend back then.

Lin Yun casually cultivated and instantly comprehended the issue. His new move lacked emotions, which was a problem since Dustlight Sword Art contained multiple emotions. It also wasn’t refined enough after being combined together.

So when Lin Yun fused his emotions in it, he instantly gained a new comprehension as he could manifest nine phenomena with this move. As such, he had finally completed this new sword technique.

“This new move is finally compatible with Dustlight Sword Art and now it can be called Terranean Destruction.” Lin Yun nodded his head with satisfaction.

But right at this moment, Lin Yun heard a familiar roar filled with dominance and desolation. This instantly made Lin Yun’s heart tremble, “The Indigothunder Dragonvulture?”

Lin Yun had refined its blood essence back then, so was keen to its aura. What made him even more surprised was that this overlord was actually injured? Just who could possibly injure it in the Flamedragon Hill?
