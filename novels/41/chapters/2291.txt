Chapter 2292 - Descend Of A Legend

“The Divine Light Sword Intent!” The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord’s face changed upon recognizing Lin Yun’s sword intent. It wasn’t Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent, but the complete version, not to mention Lin Yun, also reached lesser mastery in it. This was unbelievable because many Saint Sovereigns couldn’t grasp it even after thousands of years, and yet a young man had grasped it.

Most importantly, only those who had grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent could be called Sword Saint. Saint Lords might be rare in the Kunlun Realm, but there were thousands of them. It wasn’t easy to become a Saint, but the number of Saints could accumulate with enough resources and time. Just the six holy lands alone had hundreds of Saints from centuries of accumulation.

But a Sword Saint was different. They had grasped the seventh-grade sword intent, possessing an invincible domain against those of the same cultivation. They could even fight those with a higher cultivation above them. Lin Yun wasn’t even thirty years old and yet he had grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent!

The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord’s mind became blank and could only retreat by instinct. After all, who dared to get close to a Sword Saint without any preparation? Even a sixth-stage Saint Lord like him could die against a Sword Saint.

Lin Yun’s hair fluttered as golden light shone from his eyes, with his sword intent soaring to the sky, shattering the thirty-six layers of heaven. The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord’s golden pill domain shattered when Lin Yun unleashed his sword intent.

“Eight Barren Heavenly Thunder Prison Array!” After the Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord retreated to a safe spot, he raised his right hand to the sky. The saint runes then intertwined in the sky, forming an ancient array. When he raised his hand to the sky, lightning pillars descended from the sky.

The next moment, the array was activated and Lin Yun’s Divine Light Sword Intent was slowly being suppressed.

“So what if you’ve grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent? You’re nothing as long as you haven’t grasped the Sword Domain!” The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord calmed down with a vicious gaze as lightning began to fall.

Lin Yun swung his sword and the Flower Burial Sword clashed with the descending lightning. It looked like a youth was facing heaven’s might with his sword from afar, and this was a shocking scene. Lin Yun was pushing his sword technique to the limit.

“Let me see how long you can last!” The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord didn’t panic as he took out a flag with a golden crow embroidered on it. This golden crow was different. It soon became purple, giving off purple lightning. When he waved the flag, the array's power increased with lightning manifesting into armored figures that charged toward Lin Yun.

“Now!” The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord circulated his golden pill and it appeared again before entering the array. He then waved the flag as the array descended towards Lin Yun. He was arrogant, but he didn’t get close to Lin Yun. He laughed, “Flower Burial, don’t you have a sharp sword? Why don’t you break my array?!”

He controlled the flag as lightning figures dashed forth, tangling Lin Yun and exhausting his sword intent.

Lin Yun said nothing as he pushed himself to the limit, unleashing sword rays at the incoming attacks. At times, he even looked like he knew where the attacks were directed.

“Flower Burial, a Sword Saint like you doesn’t dare to fight me head-on? Or you can’t?” The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord became anxious as he provoked Lin Yun.

“As you wish…” Lin Yun shook his wrist and coldly looked at the Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord.

“Hahaha! Why don’t you come!” The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord rejoiced. He feared Lin Yun wouldn’t come since the array was dangerous, and the lightning would overlap. He was afraid that Lin Yun would hole up like a tortoise shell. At that time, he would be the one who lost as time passed.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

But his smile soon froze as thirty-six afterimages flew out from Lin Yun’s body. The world became black and white as the thirty-six afterimages looked like thirty-six brushes. Lin Yun slowly drew a massive ‘Heaven’ word.

“Heaven Sword Form!” When the ‘Heaven’ word was formed, Lin Yun swung his sword and the array nodes were destroyed by the sword rays he unleashed. Lin Yun might have appeared to be defending, but he was meticulous and found the array's weaknesses. This was why he could destroy it the moment he made his move.

“Earth Sword Form!” Lin Yun approached as he swung his sword rays. The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord could barely hold his ground before, but now he had quickly reached his limit and was covered in blood.

“Heaven and Earth Unite!” Lin Yun moved as the two words revolved with hundreds of sword rays flying out. Very quickly, a crack appeared on the Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord’s golden pill.

“Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord, we’ll help you!” Two figures descended when the Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord’s golden pill was about to be destroyed again. They were sixth-stage Saint Lords from the Ming Cult and Heavenly Flame Sect.

“Starfire Meteorite!”

“Sun-Moon Seal!” They shattered the ‘Heaven’ and ‘Earth’ words, pushing Lin Yun back. Before Lin Yun could land on the ground, they soared into the sky and charged towards Lin Yun.

The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord took this opportunity and released the full power of his array.

“Profound Sword Form!” Lin Yun spun as he drew a ‘Profound’ word, bouncing the three attacks back.

“Damn it!” The three sixth-stage Saint Lords’ faces changed.

Lin Yun landed on a hovering rock as multiple sword rays charged at the three sixth-stage Saint Lords while he executed the Carefree 9 Swords. Canvases began to open up, with each painting being filled with people performing different sword techniques. This was a shocking scene that nearly made everyone’s jaws drop.

“This is a Sword Saint?”

“I’m afraid that no one will call him Flower Burial but Flower Burial Sword Saint in the future.”

“It looks like another Sword Saint has appeared in the Eastern Desolation.”

Everyone in the surrounding area was dumbfounded as they looked at the Roost End Saint Lord with complicated gazes. It turned out that the Roost End Saint Lord held back with his words.

The Roost End Saint Lord feared that they wouldn’t believe him if he told the truth, so he held back his words. But after witnessing this, the Roost End Saint Lord was dumbfounded. Flower Burial Sword Saint? What the hell is going on?

“Roost End Saint Lord, it’s really, as you said. You held back in your words about his strength.”

“It’s no wonder why you didn’t dare to tell us the truth. We wouldn’t have believed it if you told us he’s a Sword Saint.”

“Sword Saint! Who would believe it if we didn’t witness it with our eyes? Roost End Saint Lord, I apologize for not believing you earlier.” Everyone’s gazes looked complicated as they spoke out.

The Roost End Saint Lord opened his mouth and said, “I… I… I…”

After witnessing Lin Yun's true strength, he bragged about Lin Yun earlier but didn’t dare to brag any longer. He also didn’t know that Lin Yun was a Sword Saint!

When he was about to continue speaking, saint music resounded as blurred golden images appeared around Lin Yun, with the surrounding space distorted. The golden images were Lin Yun’s history with golden radiances shining out, accompanied by saint music.

“Damn it! What’s going on?!”

“Saint music and heavenly dao pictures? Isn’t that the phenomenon belonging to legends? The heavenly dao recorded Lin Yun’s history, which is the treatment of legends.”

“The Nine Emperors also had such phenomenon in the past and became legends, enjoying great fortune.”

“H-How is this possible?!” The phenomenon had cast a golden layer on the battlefield, with the music echoing in everyone’s ears. Everyone was shocked, including all the fighting Saint Lords. They were dumbfounded and couldn’t help halting their attacks.

The Roost End Saint Lord’s hand trembled, and emotionally said, “H-He’s the legend of the current era!”
