Chapter 1328 - Four Transcendents Joining Forces!

As time continued to pass, more and more geniuses gathered around the Great Saint Origin. Furthermore, they were all on the Empyrean Ranking, and the tension in the surroundings also began to rapidly rise. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“The Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s Nangong Ze is here!” An uproar broke out as a group of black-clothed youths appeared. They were all wielding a blade, and this instantly captivated countless people’s attention.

Nangong Ze had a high popularity. Aside from the fact that he was also a fated transcendent, he was also ranked first in terms of his blade techniques. Although the number of bladesmen couldn’t be compared to swordsmen, it was still one of the most used weapons amongst cultivators. So there weren’t any bladesmen that didn’t recognize Nangong Ze.

Suddenly sensing a gaze, Lin Yun turned and saw someone whispering in Nangong Ze’s ear, causing Nangong Ze’s gaze to briefly pause on him. But Lin Yun wasn’t too bothered about it because what was fated to come would definitely come. When he took the Quasi-Saint Origin and Dragon Saint Pellet, Lin Yun already knew that they definitely wouldn’t let him go so easily.

“The Thunder Sect’s Zhang Jin is here!” Another fated transcendent arrived. This was also someone who had refined an origin saint rune. Although he had suppressed his aura, there was no way he could suppress it entirely, not to mention that he had a unique temperament that captivated everyone’s attention upon arrival.

Suddenly, a light filled with the profundities of Buddhism shone as the sound of a mantra chant resounded. Everyone instantly knew that the Vajra Monastery had come. They were all enveloped in holy light as they landed on the ground.

Every single one of them was bald, and they also had robust figures. When they landed on the ground, they all sat down with their eyes closed, looking like they weren’t interested in any competition. The young monk leading the party was donned in a crimson kasaya and holding onto a staff. Hanging from his neck was a necklace made of huge beads.

He also had a robust figure like the other monks, but he wasn’t as amicable-looking as others, who had overbearing lights flashing in their pupils.

When Lin Yun looked at him, he couldn’t help thinking about Drifting Goblet. Compared to these people, Drifting Goblet didn’t look like a monk at all. Now that he remembered Drifting Goblet, it had been some time since they met, and he realized that he actually missed him a little.

“That’s the fated transcendent of the Vajra Monastery. His dharma nickname is Cang Yun. The Vajra Monastery doesn’t have any conservation about killing, unlike other monks. Rather, they prefer to take the role of subduing demons by force,” explained Ye Ziling.

Lin Yun nodded his head. He now knew why those monks were emitting a killing aura. But their killing intent had fused with the Buddhist teachings, making it pure and filled with a domineering aura. Shortly after, the fated transcendent of the Emerald Jade Manor, Ning Feng, also arrived. He was donned in a saint armor with a robust figure.

“Ancient armor!” Someone recognized the armor that Ning Feng was wearing, and this instantly made their faces change. They could tell that the armor wasn’t ordinary, and it was faintly enveloped in a holy tune. That was Ning Feng’s harvest on the Profound Wither Island, and it felt too unbelievable to many.

Many people speculated the origin saint rune he had refined might even come from this ancient armor. As a saint artifact used in the Ancient Era for war, it was definitely covered in the blood of countless enemies. The armor was nourished by the blood of the enemies, and this was why it could be so well-preserved till now.

“That fellow Ning Feng is really lucky.” Nangong Ze, Zhang Jin, and Cang Yun couldn’t help directing their attention towards Ning Feng. Not long later, the fated transcendents of the Profound Valley and Heavenly Note Sect had also arrived, and the two of them seemed to have formed an alliance.

The Profound Valley mainly cultivated spiritual runes, while the Heavenly Note Sect cultivated music. Both of the powerful sects had low profiles in the Ancient Barren Domain, and they rarely got involved in conflicts with others. Since the two sects frequently interacted, it wasn’t surprising that the two sects would form an alliance.

Right at this moment, a bolt of lightning streaked across the sky and Dugu Yan had arrived with his men from the Azure Thunder Sect. Amongst the big sects, only the Azure Thunder Sect could still hold its ground. As for the other sects, they didn’t dare to appear before Lin Yun at all.

“Ladies and gentlemen, what are you guys waiting for?” Dugu Yan was prideful as he asked, looking in the direction of the powerful sects.

“No rush. Let’s wait for the Sword Sect,” said Nangong Ze.

Their words were rather abrupt. It sounded like they were talking about the Great Saint Origin, but it also didn’t look like it at the same time.

Right at that moment, Sikong Zhou arrived with the Sword Sect’s disciples and deacons. With that, all the powerful sects from the Ancient Barren Domain have gathered, aside from the Profound Sky Sect. This could be the biggest gathering over the past few years, gathering every single transcendent who was ranked in the top ten of the Empyrean Ranking.

As a commotion rose from the surroundings, everyone’s gazes began to rotate between the fated transcendents. After all, their existences were too dazzling, and it was hard not to attract their attention.

“The Profound Sky Sect is here!” It didn’t take long for this entire region to be enveloped in a faint chill as the Profound Sky Sect’s party descended from the sky. The Three Saints of the Profound Sky Sect were taking the lead, and their existences were dazzling. Just the pressure they emitted instantly made everyone feel suffocating, especially Qin Cang, who was standing at the forefront.

Lei Jue and Xuan Ying, who were standing beside him, were strong enough, but Qin Cang easily outshone them. So his appearance easily made everyone neglect the other two. With that, the eight powerful sects and their fated transcendents have gathered together.

Right at this moment, a sudden outburst of killing intent exploded that instantly made the surroundings quiet. Everyone was shocked because the outburst of killing intent exploded when Qin Cang just arrived. Could it be that they were targeting Qin Cang?

But how was that possible? Qin Cang was someone who was ranked first on the Empyrean Ranking for many years, and no one could shake his position. If someone really wanted to target Qin Cang, then they would’ve made their move before the Profound Wither Island opened.

When everyone looked in the direction that the killing intent came from, they were surprised because it was Nangong Ze of the Heavenly Blade Pavilion. Nangong Ze’s face had turned dark, and everyone quickly turned their heads away because they didn’t dare to look at Nangong Ze in his eyes.

But this instantly made everyone wonder what Nangong Ze was trying to do, and their hearts couldn’t help beating wildly. Before they could figure out what was going on, three killing intents on the same level as Nangong Ze exploded in a row. The killing auras came from Zhang Jin, Ning Feng, and Dugu Yan. Furthermore, their killing intents resonated with Nangong Ze.

This instantly left everyone from the Vajra Monastery, Profound Valley, Heavenly Note Sect, and even the Profound Sky Sect confused because they had no idea what the four of them were trying to do.

“What are they trying to do?” Lei Jue and Xuan Ying’s faces slightly changed, but they couldn’t figure out what the four of them were trying to do. Who were they targeting by joining forces?

After all, the forces that they were representing were terrifying, and if they were joining hands, the only conclusion they could come up with was that they were targeting the Profound Sky Sect. Thinking about it here, Lei Jue and Xuan Yin’s eyes became cold with a cold smirk rising on their lips.

“Qin Cang…let us borrow someone from you.” Nangong Ze said, and his words were targeted at Qin Cang, just as everyone had expected.

“Speak,” replied Qin Cang indifferently.

“Everyone in the Profound Sky Sect knows that Flower Burial is yours. But before that, we have something we’d like to settle with him,” said Nangong Ze. The moment he said that, an uproar instantly erupted amongst the crowd. They were surprised that four fated transcendents would join forces to deal with Lin Yun.

But was there a need to have such a huge array? When the fated transcendents appeared, everyone had already tossed Lin Yun to the back of their minds. It was true that Lin Yun was strong, but he hadn’t even reached the Elysium Core Realm. Without engraving an origin saint rune on his elysium core, there was no way he would have any chance of winning against the four fated transcendents.

Furthermore, they were also surprised that the four of them would make a move against Lin Yun first and not Qin Cang.

“Oh?” Qin Cang replied without any emotions, and his indifference also left many people surprised.

“My Senior Brother has no interest in Flower Burial. So you guys can go ahead and do whatever you guys want as long as you keep him alive,” smiled Lei Jue. His words made the four fated transcendents surprised, since they had no idea what Qin Cang had in mind.

But they merely exchanged a glance and threw this matter to the back of their minds. The four of them came before the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Everyone’s breathing became hurried as they watched the four fated transcendents walk towards Lin Yun.

“The Quasi-Saint Origin and Dragon Saint Pellet should still be with you, right?” Nangong Ze said while looking at Lin Yun.

Upon hearing that, everyone finally knew what was going on. After all, Flower Burial had previously taken the Quasi-Saint Origin and Dragon Saint Pellet while suppressing the three powerful sects. This matter had long spread out on the Profound Wither Island, and everyone practically knew about it.

Judging from their looks right now, they were planning to settle it with Lin Yun. This wasn’t just a matter of treasures, but the faces of their sects. If they didn’t respond, the fact that Lin Yun suppressed three powerful sects all by himself would greatly affect their sects.

When they grouped together as they walked over, everyone who was in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s direction immediately fled for their lives. The pressure that the four were releasing was simply too terrifying.

After all, just one of them was heaven-defyingly strong, not to mention the four of them together. They couldn’t think of anyone who could hold their ground against the four of them when they have joined forces!
