Chapter 2332 - Azure Divine Palace

This scene left everyone dumbfounded. Seeing this, Bai Yu sneered, “It looks like the Brandished Dragon Ranking has to be re-ranked for someone like him to be on it.”

Bai Yu already held a grudge when he saw Xin Wuhen leaving, and he naturally wouldn’t mind kicking him now that he was down.

Ao Jue said, “Who’s that fellow? He has been walking around weirdly, but Lin Jiangxian and Xiong Tiannan stood out for him.”

Bai Yu smiled, “He’s probably a guest of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion. But if he’s really strong, he wouldn’t have to rely on Xiong Tiannan and Lin Jiangxian.”

This caused quite the commotion, but Xin Wuhen could only suck it up.

“Are you alright?” Lin Jiangxian asked, looking at Lin Yun. After all, that palm from Xin Wuhen wasn’t that easy to bear.

Lin Yun shrugged and wasn’t bothered by it. He smiled, “I'm fine. I’ll look around.”

But when he took a few steps, Xiong Tiannan returned and pointed at the rock in his hand. He smiled, “Help me bless it!”

Bless? Lin Yun smiled and could only gather Nirvana Dao in his hand before pointing at it.

This made Xiong Tiannan smile, and he grinned, “Brother, I’ll help you beat him to death if Xin Wuhen comes after you. There’s no need to put up with someone like him.”

Lin Yun smiled, “You might not be Xin Wuhen’s opponent if the two of you fight, right?”

Xiong Tiannan awkwardly smiled and said, “I’ll comprehend first.”

Lin Yun didn’t think much of it and looked at the Sovereign Monument, his smile fading. He could sense an ill gaze that came from Xin Wuhen. But Lin Yun ignored him since he didn’t place Xin Wuhen in his heart and focused on the Sovereign Monument. He began to circle the Stone Monument with a grave expression, not daring to relax.

“What is he doing?” Lin Jiangxian asked, looking at Ji Zixi.

“He must be comprehending the Sovereign Monument, trying to discover the secrets,” Ji Zixi said calmly.

But Lin Jiangxian had doubts on her face. It wasn’t because she doubted Lin Yun’s strength, but no one could uncover the Sovereign Monument’s secrets, and she knew how difficult it was.

Ji Zixi didn’t lower her voice, so it was heard by everyone, who were briefly stunned before they started laughing.

“I was finding it weird as to why he is wandering around, but it turns out that he’s trying to uncover the secrets of the Sovereign Monument.”

“The Sovereign Monument has appeared countless times, but no one could uncover its secret.”

“How naive. I initially thought he might be a figure, but it looks like he’s just a joke.”

“Obtaining a Golden Dao Fruit is more reliable than trying to uncover the Sovereign Monument’s secrets.” Discussion resounded from the surroundings and even Bai Yu sneered with disdain on his face.

Lin Yun didn’t know what the others were thinking but finally noticed something unusual about the Sovereign Monument. The Sovereign Monument shone eight times as time passed, and Lin Yun obtained eight Golden Dao Fruits.

As for the other cultivators from the Azure Cloud Realm, they only obtained a Silver Dao Fruit at best. The Sovereign Monument would shine for one last time, and they wouldn’t have any more chances if they still couldn’t obtain a Golden Dao Fruit.

Finally, Lin Yun found something. He saw something different after changing eighty-odd locations. When he circulated the Nirvana Dao, he squinted and saw countless golden bubbles in the Sovereign Monument. Each bubble was a word with people comprehending dao in it.

The golden bubbles were illusory worlds that everyone was in. Many cultivators were deep in the bubbles, trying to break through the illusion. Even if they had managed to do it, they were soon devoured by another bubble since there were too many bubbles.

But from Lin Yun’s angle, the bubbles were only the tip of the iceberg in the Sovereign Monument. When he looked at the other side, he saw that the bubbles came from a slumbering divine dragon. The divine dragon was snoring with bubbles being produced from its nose. Above the divine dragon was an island enveloped in fog with zither music that could be heard from it.

“I finally found you!” Lin Yun opened his eyes and his consciousness sank into that space. He passed through the bubbles and came onto that island.

Many cultivators in the bubbles threw out a mouthful of blood with fear on their faces when Lin Yun stepped on their bubbles. Passing through the fog, Lin Yun saw a painting. This was a white-clothed man caressing the zither on a towering tree with the divine dragon sleeping by his side.

When the white-clothed man saw Lin Yun, he wasn’t surprised and helplessly said, “Why are you forcing it?”

“You’ve framed me,” Lin Yun smiled.

The white-clothed man roared, “You’ve already grasped the Nirvana Dao, and you're now suitable to become my successor. Furthermore, I have given you enough benefits!”

Lin Yun knew why there was a Golden Dao Fruit even though he didn’t comprehend the Sovereign Monument. This white-clothed man wanted him to behave. He rolled his eyes and smiled, “I have a friend suitable to be your successor.”

After he waved his hand, a golden bubble appeared with Ji Zixi comprehending within it.

“She’s suitable, but it’s a pity that she’s a phoenix,” the white-clothed man said after glancing at it.

Lin Yun pointed at Lin Jiangxian, and the white-clothed man said, “Her talent is enough, but are you not more suitable if she is considered suitable?”

Lin Yun instantly knew that this person might not be a swordsman. He reached out, pointing at Xiong Tiannan, asking, “What about him?”

In the golden bubble, Xiong Tiannan was digging a tomb. When he saw a tomb shining with golden radiance, he was excited. He said, “Holy shit, I can dig out tombs here. Is this a divine tomb? Hahaha! I’m the best!”

“Even if the talent of my successor is bad, he has to have a normal mind!” The white-clothed man roared.

Lin Yun couldn’t hold himself back and laughed, “Please calm down. Why don’t we negotiate a little? You give me an Eternal Dao Fruit, and I’ll pretend I didn’t come here.”

“Get lost!” The white-clothed man said. Lin Yun was really greedy to not give up after obtaining so many Golden Dao Fruits.

But Lin Yun wasn’t furious and looked around before his gaze fell onto the divine dragon. He walked over and asked, “I wonder what will happen if this divine dragon wakes up…”

“Stop!” The white-clothed man became nervous.

“It looks like I’m right,” Lin Yun smiled as he walked towards the divine dragon, planning to wake it up.

This made the white-clothed man’s face change as he began to play the zither, unleashing countless threads at Lin Yun. Those threads were connected to lives from countless worlds, and each contained unimaginable power. But when they landed on Lin Yun, nirvana knocked them away.

“As I expected.” Lin Yun calmed down. It was as he had speculated. The white-clothed man couldn’t do anything to him as long as he grasped an Eternal Dao. Otherwise, the white-clothed man wouldn’t have given him so many Golden Dao Fruits. He said, “Everything is nothing before nirvana.”

He noticed this white-clothed man probably grasped the Karma Dao, the most mysterious dao amongst the Nine Eternal Daos. He asked, “What will happen if the divine dragon awakens?”

The white-clothed man felt helpless and said, “That’s not a divine dragon, but a heavenly dragon. Even the Sovereign Monument won’t be able to suppress it if it wakes up. It is why this thought of mine can exist and not extinguish… Forget it, I agree.”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he heard about the Heavenly Dragon.

“Two! Two Eternal Dao Fruits!” The white-clothed man said.

Lin Yun finally recollected his gaze. He was tempted earlier when he heard about the Heavenly Dragon, but it probably wouldn’t be good news for him if the heavenly dragon woke up. There were too many uncertainties, and a deity was nervous about it. He now knew why the Heavenly Dragon Bone left behind by the Southern Emperor would cause such a huge commotion in the Kunlun Realm.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When the Sovereign Monument shone the ninth time, Lin Yun opened his eyes with two crimson fruits in his hand. He only glanced at them before storing it. But not many people paid attention to them since their attention was on the fruit in their hands. Some looked satisfied, while some were disappointed.

When everyone from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion gathered, they began to share their harvest. Xiong Tiannan walked over to Lin Yun with excitement. He said, “Brother Lin, guess what I dug out in the illusory world?

“A golden coffin! It’s a divine coffin, but it’s a pity that I don’t have enough time to open it up,” Xiong Tiannan said.

Lin Yun merely smiled and said nothing. He now knew why the white-clothed man would be so furious.

A considerable commotion resounded as the Sovereign Monument burrowed into the ground, with everyone looking at it with pity. But some smart people quickly left before the Sovereign Monument returned to the ground.

After comprehending the Sovereign Monument nine times, they all had dao fruits on them, and those dao fruits were all treasures. Some even obtained Silver Dao Fruits, and they wouldn’t be able to leave if they didn’t leave now.

But before they could leave, they were sent flying back, throwing blood on the ground. A considerable commotion resounded as a mountain was shattered.

This shocked all the Azure Cloud Realm’s cultivators as they saw four figures, three men and a woman, in the sky who had released a terrifying aura. Anyone could tell with a glance that they weren’t pushovers.

“The Azure Divine Palace!”

“It’s the Azure Divine Palace!” Someone exclaimed with an unnatural expression.

After those four appeared, another person walked out with a smile, amicably looking at everyone from the Azure Cloud Realm.

When Xiong Tiannan saw this person, his face changed, and he exclaimed, “It’s him! Wang Jue!”

Wang Jue donned an azure daoist robe as he looked around with a smile. He said, “It looks like I’m here at the right time. All of you must’ve comprehended the Sovereign Monument, right?”
