Chapter 2421 - Crimson Mountain and River

“Don’t look down on the Sword Sect. They will probably activate their defensive array during that tribulation,” the Ancient Key Great Saint said. He looked elegant, unlike your typical demonic cultivator.

Tian Xuanzi said, “Even you can’t break the Sword Sect’s Nine Heavens Great Profound Sword Array?”

The Ancient Key Great Saint was a spiritualist amongst the seven. He might look elegant, but he sacrificed two million living beings when he was attempting to reach the Saint Realm in the past. He also had the most sins among the seven saints.

There were bounties on him from the various holy lands within Eastern Desolation, but because of his high attainment in spiritual arrays, he managed to escape every time. Not to mention that he had grasped the technique to refine saint artifacts and had good connections, which was why he was protected. When he became a Great Saint, no one dared to provoke him anymore.

The Ancient Key Great Saint said, “The Sword Sect might’ve lost two peaks and no longer have nine mountains, but the Great Profound Sword Array is too powerful. If Mu Xuankong is the one personally controlling it with all the disciples empowering it, it’s impossible to break the array without an emperor.”

The other Great Saints frowned upon hearing that since they trusted the Ancient Key Great Saint. But no Emperors were allowed to participate, which was a rapport in the Kunlun Realm. The White Bone Great Saint said, “No Emperors will make a move. After all, who would dare to offend Yu Qingfeng?”

The so-called “rapport" was nothing before absolute strength. There wouldn’t be any rapport if not for Yu Qingfeng, and the Sword Sect would’ve long been destroyed.

Tian Xuanzi said, “Are there any other ways?”

“There is. There’s no invincible array in the world. One is to destroy it from inside, and the other is to find another way,” the Ancient Key Great Saint said.

Tian Xuanzi shook his head and said, “I have a long interaction with the Sword Sect, and I only managed to plant some insignificant chess pieces. There isn’t even a Quasi-Saint amongst them, not to mention a Saint.”

The Ancient Key Great Saint wasn’t surprised by that reply, and said, “This means we can only find another way. The Divine Dao Pavilion has a Dragon Slaughter Scissor, and I can break the array with it.”

The other saints of the Black Mountain fell into deep thoughts upon hearing that. The Ancient Key Great Saint was a disciple of the Divine Dao Pavilion in the past, and he didn’t give up on his desire for the Dragon Slaughter Scissor. They couldn’t borrow the Sovereign Saint Artifact from the Divine Dao Pavilion, and no one knew if it was to break the Great Profound Sword Array or the Ancient Key Great Saint’s selfish motives.

The Ancient Key Great Saint raised his cup calmly, and no one could analyze anything from his expression.

Tian Xuanzi said, “I’ll deal with that. I’m not sure if I can borrow it. We can’t force the Divine Dao Pavilion too much if they maintain neutrality.”

A hint of disappointment flashed in the Ancient Key Great Saint’s eyes, which Tian Xuanzi captured. This made Tian Xuanzi inwardly sneer, but he still maintained a smile. Just when he wanted to speak, his face suddenly changed as he turned to look at the Sword Sect’s direction.

The other Great Saint’s faces also changed as the eight soared to the sky, looking at the Sword Sect’s direction. The Sword Sect was far from here, but they could see that a crimson pillar of light was dying the sky crimson as a terrifying aura spread out.

Tian Xuanzi could see further, and the crimson radiance came from within the Sword Sect, followed by various terrifying phenomena. Bolts of lightning streaked across the horizon along with sword rays, and the crimson clouds enveloped half of the Ancient Barren Domain with the ground trembling.

The demonic beasts in the woods all had fear on their faces as they fled in the opposite direction of the Sword Sect. Aside from the various phenomena, they could also hear the roar of heavenly dao and sword intent. The sword was fighting with heaven. There was no question that this was a sign that the Radiant Sword Saint would face his tribulation.

“How abrupt,” the White Bone Great Saint said.

The Ancient Key Great Saint said, “The Radiant Sword Saint can’t hold it back, and this phenomenon has only been seen in ancient records. I can’t imagine the difficulty of the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation.”

Reaching the Emperor Realm would give birth to terrifying phenomena, and this was the most dangerous one.

“If he can take that step out, he really might be able to compete with the Nine Emperors in the future.”

“It looks like he has a really strong attachment!”

“I’m not optimistic about him making it through his tribulation.” The seven saints spoke out, wearing grave expressions. Only the Netherport Sword Saint’s face was dark, and he said nothing.

Tian Xuanzi noticed that the Netherport Sword Saint’s hand was trembling, and was shocked by the Radiant Sword Saint’s attainment in the sword. Back then, the three Sword Saints were on the same level, but the Radiant Sword Saint had thrown him far behind.

A long time later, the Netherport Sword Saint said, “It’s not surprising. After all, the person he wants to compete with is Yu Qingfeng. We can’t allow him to succeed even with a slight chance.”

The tribulation might be dangerous, but it wasn’t exactly impossible.

“He’s courting death!” A cold voice resounded and everyone turned to look at Tian Xuanzi.

“He can no longer contain his sword intent. Judging from the phenomenon, he will face his tribulation within three days. You guys immediately head to the Profound Sky Sect and join up with the other three holy lands. I’ll take a trip to the Divine Dao Pavilion!” Tian Xuanzi waved his hand and headed to the Divine Dao Pavilion’s direction.

A brief moment later, the Heavenly Sever Great Saint, the strongest amongst the seven, gravely said, “Let’s bring the seven treasures along. Netherport is right, we can’t give him any chance!”

The other six nodded and were excited.

At the same time, all the Saints in the Kunlun Realm noticed the crimson pillar of light. They knew that the commotion for the Radiant Sword Saint’s breakthrough would be great, but they never expected it would be so terrifying.

The sect masters of the Ming Cult, Heavenly Flame Sect, and Myriad Lightning Sect quickly recovered from their shock and headed to the Profound Sky Sect.

In the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s ancestor hall, all the saints flew out, including Lil’ Purple. She crushed the jade slip in her hand with a grave expression. The jade slip was her contact to Su Ziyao.

“It’s Crimson Mountain and River. If the Radiant Sword Saint fails, his blood will probably dye all the mountains and rivers in the Eastern Desolation,” the Divine Phoenix Holy Master said.

“If it is the Crimson Mountain and River, the odds of him making it through isn’t that high,” a Divine Phoenix Mountain's Saint Elder said. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“It’s fine if he fails and dies, but it's another matter if someone wants to interfere,” Lil’ Purple said.

That Saint Elder no longer said a word upon hearing that.

“Divine Phoenix Holy Master, time to fulfill your promise,” Lil’ Purple said.

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master nodded, and said, “We’re all prepared. We’re only waiting for you to give the order.”

Lil’ Purple knew how urgent this matter was, so she said, “Move out immediately! We have to rush to the Sword Sect!”

““Roger that!””

In the Heavenly Dao Sect, five great saints were hovering in the air, looking at the Ancient Barren Domain. Around them, many saints were also looking in that direction.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint said, “I’ll stay here to guard the sect. You guys... can go.”

Ever since that night, the Heavenly Dao Sect suffered a heavy blow. But everyone was here aside from the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword. If the four Great Saints left, the Heavenly Dao Sect would be empty, but the Thousand Plume Great Saint had no intentions of stopping them because he knew that he couldn’t stop them.

These four had a deep relationship with the Radiant Sword Saint, and they naturally had to help protect the Radiant Sword Saint for him to undergo his tribulation.

“Thank you, Thousand Plume Great Saint,” Ye Guhan said.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint calmly said, “No need to thank me. I would have also headed over if I was not worried that the Blood Moon Sect might return. After all, the Radiant Sword Saint is righteous, protecting the Ancient Barren Domain for three thousand years with his sword.”

The four Great Saints left after cupping their fists.

The commotion of the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation alarmed countless people as an innumerable number of saints headed to the Ancient Barren Domain. Some wanted to protect the Radiant Sword Saint, some wanted to help the Profound Sky Sect, but most wanted to observe.

The entire world was shocked at this moment.

In the Divine Dragon Empire, a golden light soared to the sky and gave off a powerful imperial aura. This person was naturally the Empress, the strongest in the Kunlun Realm. Her eyes seemed as though she could make everything bow before her, and she was also shrouded in saint music with the surrounding space distorted with golden phenomena appearing.

Several figures flew over that were enveloped in golden radiance, and they were the other emperors of the Nine Emperors, looking at the Ancient Barren Domain.

“If he succeeds, he will be able to rival us in just a few hundred years.”

“Who would've thought that Yu Qingfeng’s casual sword would create such a monster?”

“Perhaps Yu Qingfeng did it on purpose.”

“Do you guys think Yu Qingfeng will make a move?” Everyone’s faces became grave.

The Empress said, “If I don’t allow him to become an Emperor, no one can help him. Not even Yu Qingfeng!”

The faces of the other emperors changed.

In the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, Jian Jingtian opened his eyes as boundless saint energy swept out. Jiang Jingtian managed to break his shackles and became a Saint Lord, but his sword aura still continued to rise. When Jian Jingtian soared to the sky, a sword vibration echoed across the entire Profound Wither Sea.
