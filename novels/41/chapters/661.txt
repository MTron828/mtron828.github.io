Chapter 662 - Crush

Lin Yun’s words were a provocation not only to Jin Yan, but to all the geniuses from Skymound City.

“This fellow’s temper is really big!”

“Not only is he trying to slap Jin Yan’s face, but he wants to step on our pride as well.”

“Who does he think he is? He thinks that he can act so arrogant just because he’s somewhat capable? Does he really think that Jin Yan can’t even take a sword from him?” All the cultivators from Skymound City had ugly expressions.

“I can take your sword. But don’t blame me for being ruthless once I receive it. I’ll give you a disclaimer, nobody can say such words before me, Jin Yan!” Jin Yan’s eyes flashed viciously as he wiped the blood off his lips. He was really injured by Lin Yun’s punch. If it wasn’t for the Heavenly Flame Armor, he might have been defeated.

Although his current state was a little terrible, he could make use of this opportunity to probe Lin Yun’s strength. Since Lin Yun dared to be so arrogant with just this much strength, then he would play with Lin Yun!

“Heavenly Flame Armor!” Jin Yun snorted as his origin energy fluctuated within his body. When his hands joined together, a terrifying aura exploded that caused a violent storm.

Under this commotion, the Heavenly Flame Armor on his body started to become denser. When it finished, a wisp of white heavenly flame appeared on his chest. Although it was weak, everyone could sense a boundless pressure coming from Jin Yan that was explosive.

“What power! Jin Yan actually cultivated the Heavenly Flame Armor to such a degree!”

“The core of the Heavenly Flame Armor is the wisp of heavenly flame on his chest. If Jin Yan brought this out earlier, he wouldn’t be in such a terrible state.”

“Hmph, let’s see how that brat deals with this situation!” Under the crowd’s gaze, the Heavenly Flame Armor became denser as the flames formed layers upon layers of armor. This gave the crowd confidence as they waited to see Lin Yun embarrass himself.

But in the next second, a torrential sword intent exploded out from Lin Yun’s body. When Lin Yun’s aura clashed with Jin Yan’s aura, a violent storm exploded.

“Xiantian sword intent in greater mastery?” Qing Ruoyou was shocked by this scene.

“It’s really the xiantian sword intent on greater mastery. I guessed that he grasped the xiantian sword intent, but not to this level. Aside from having a low cultivation, this Lin Yun seems rather interesting,” said Xiang Tianhe as he looked at Lin Yun with a grave expression that contained some curiosity.

“I see…” Jin Yan was also surprised before he sneered inwardly. It was just as he had expected. Lin Yun really grasped the xiantian sword intent, not to mention that it was in greater mastery.

“Still not attacking? I can’t wait for it!” Jin Yan sneered as he was confident that his Heavenly Flame Armor could withstand Lin Yun’s attack.

“As you wish!” Lin Yun waved his hand and grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword. When he took a step forward, he unsheathed his sword. With the Flower Burial Sword in his hands, his sword aura climbed even higher. At this moment, he was like a dazzling sun in the sky.

The so-called Heavenly Flame Armor only lasted for a split second under Lin Yun’s sword. In the next second, cracks began to appear on the Heavenly Flame Armor before ultimately shattering.

Jin Yan was sent flying as he threw up a mouthful of blood. Countless flaming fragments flew out as his Heavenly Flame Armor had thoroughly collapsed. When Jin Yan landed on the ground, his vision blurred before he could stand up and a sword was pointed at the tip of his nose. Along with it was a clear voice, “You lost.”

“Dream on!” Jin Yan roared as he waved his hand and knocked the sword away. But before he could raise his hand, a sword ray flashed and slapped his face. Jin Yan was sent flying by the slap.

Not giving Jin Yan an opportunity to react, Lin Yun stepped forward and stabbed his sword out twice, with each sword containing explosive power. After the two more attacks, Jin Yan took a few steps back and spit up more blood.

Luminous Moon!

But Lin Yun had no intention of stopping. On the contrary, he charged forward with his attack empowered by his xiantian sword intent.

A brilliant sword ray echoed out as Lin Yun soared into the sky. The sword in his hand had turned into a bright moon before descending down. The terrifying sword aura had enveloped Jin Yan who was trembling violently.

Under the radiant moon empowered by sword intent, Jin Yan looked tiny. He clearly wanted to move, but his legs just wouldn’t listen. As the moon gradually approached and the sword intent continued to grow more powerful.

Only at this moment did Jin Yan realize that the sword intent wasn’t as simple as he had imagined. The power contained in the sword had far exceeded his imagination.

Jin Yan was sent flying by this attack. When he landed on the ground, he was kneeling on the edge of the stage, nearly falling off. As he rested, his pale face dripped in sweat.

Aside from the whistling sword wind, the surroundings were quiet. No one had imagined that Lin Yun would be so powerful when he drew his sword. He had only used a single sword to crush Jin Yan’s Heavenly Flame Armor.

They never expected that Jin Yan would be so weak and they were unable to even accept his loss. But after a brief moment later, a commotion broke out from the surroundings.

“This is the power of the xiantian sword intent in complete mastery?”

“The sword in his hand isn’t simple. It’s clearly a low ranked cosmic artifact, but it gives me a feeling that it wasn’t any inferior to a high ranked cosmic artifact.”

“This sword probably has a huge origin. But the terrifying factor is his strength. If his sword intent wasn’t enough, he wouldn’t be able to have such grace using the sword.”

“To have such strength in the greater Yang stage… no wonder he defeated Ji Wuye.” The elites of the Skymound City all felt humiliated by Jin Yan’s performance. But even so, they had to admit that Lin Yun was truly powerful. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Among the crowd, Yang Fan and Guo Xu couldn’t conceal their shock. Two months ago, Lin Yun was in a rather terrible state facing three Yin-Yang stage elders. But now, he could deal with a lesser Yin-Yang stage genius from a major clan so easily.

One must know that as a genius of a clan, the foundation and strength Jin Yan had far surpasses those in the same realm as him. These geniuses were nothing like the Bloodwing Pavilion’s elders. So they felt that it was too unbelievable for Lin Yun to get so strong in just two months.

“Sorry about that.” Lin Yun sheathed his sword and looked at Jin Yan.

When he returned to his seat, Yang Fan whispered, “Lin Yun, your insight in the sword path increased?”

“Yeah,” nodded Lin Yun. The so-called insight in sword path wasn’t just sword intent, but also his sword sutra and sword technique. His xiantian sword intent might be in complete mastery, but he couldn’t get further as he was restricted by the Iris Sword Sutra.

His boost in strength mainly came from the third move of the Overlord Sword. His insight in the sword path had greatly increased his comprehension. He was only using his xiantian sword intent in greater mastery, but the power was entirely different compared to two months ago.

It was like when a baby swung a sword and when a man swung a sword. The difference was night and day.

“Get lost!” Jin Yan roared as he pushed away those who were trying to help him up. Looking at Lin Yun, he spoke coldly, “Don’t leave Skymound City if you dare. Today’s matter isn’t over!”

But no one was bothered by it. All the geniuses here weren’t simple. Since Lin Yun could defeat Jin Yan while being in the Yang stage, Jin Yan would have no chance to catch up to him in the future. But everyone was curious because today’s matter would definitely spread out in Skymound City.

They were curious as to who would win if Lin Yun faced the seven strongest geniuses in Skymound City. Along with Jin Yan’s departure, the gathering started to come to a close. After a few more sparring sessions, Xiang Tianhe finally went onto the stage to put on a display of his strength.

The one who sought guidance from him was Fang Yan. Throughout the spar, Xiang Tianhe suppressed his cultivation and exchanged several moves with Yang Fan.

But after ten moves, his attacks became even more powerful, sending Yang Fan’s whip flying with a flick of his spear. Then, he waved his hand and made Yang Fan take several steps back.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he saw this scene. Although Xiang Tianhe had suppressed his cultivation, the sparring session was perfect. Xiang Tianhe didn’t waste an extra wisp of origin energy in his sparring with Yang Fan.

“Thank you.” Xiang Tianhe smiled before turning to everyone, “Let’s call it a day. I’ll be at home for the next few days, so you guys are welcome to look for me for some guidance.”

It didn’t take long for everyone to leave the hall. But before they left, they couldn’t help examining Lin Yun with a complicated gaze. Lin Yun’s performance today was breathtaking, especially after he used his sword because it engraved a deep impression on everyone.

Just when Lin Yun, Yang Fan, and Guo Xu were about to leave, they were called out by Qing Ruoyou, “Wait.”

Qing Ruoyou slowly stood up and looked down from above. Her gaze was only focused on Lin Yun, so Yang Fan and Guo Xu tactfully departed.
