Chapter 1772 – Sword Fanatic Zhao Yan

Who wouldn’t want to be first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking? Lin Yun naturally wasn’t an exception. With his personality, he would definitely fight for first place if he was still in the Sword Sect. If he was with them, he would definitely fight for it.

But there was no need for him to cause so much trouble today. After seeing how the six holy lands’ geniuses and the Four Young Masters competed for it so openly, he knew how troublesome the first position on the Dragon Pulse Ranking was. Because he had a sensitive identity, he decided against competing.

However, he might give it a shot if there was an opportunity, and he was pretty confident in the Divine Tortoise Transformation. But his identity had to be kept a secret; not to mention that nine thousand foot-long dragon pulses were a little too shocking.

If he didn’t pay attention, his tribulation might arrive. He still wasn’t fully prepared to face his tribulation and wasn’t sure how terrifying it would be. Most importantly, Lin Yun still had no precise gauge of his strength.

It had been half a year since he really fought, and he didn’t have an accurate judgment on his current strength. After practicing music dao for so long, it suddenly felt weird to return to martial dao. The Nirvana Banquet was just a small play, but he still had some distance to be compared to geniuses like Ji Lingfeng.

“Everyone here is a genius in their force, so I hope everyone won’t hold too much regard in winning or losing. It’s not frightening even if you lose, and your trip here is worthwhile if you gain something after seeing everyone’s fights here.” The Autumn Mountain Lord said. “Now, I wonder who wants to be the first to fight on the stage before the Dragon Pulse Ranking!”

“Hahaha! Let me start the Martial Dao Tea Party, then. Chen Xiong of the Ghostcloud Sect is here. Who wants to fight me?” After the Autumn Mountain Lord's announcement, a person appeared on the Thunderblood Battlestage.

Chen Xiong was strong and could be ranked within the top five thousandths on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. But he wasn’t conspicuous in the Thunderblood Square. His main objective for fighting first was to win fame. Otherwise, with his strength, no one would remember his name after the Martial Dao Tea Party.

Besides, the Martial Dao Tea Party differed from martial competitions, and the atmosphere was relatively friendly. He was a genius on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, and those with a higher ranking than him would feel disdain when fighting him. So those who would fight him were those with similar rankings or those who were ranked lower than him. In the worst-case scenario, he wouldn’t lose that terribly.

“Floating Palace’s Zhong Ying is here to fight you!” A person rose to the sky and came to the Thunderblood Battlestage. The Floating Palace and Ghostcloud Sect were local forces within the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. Without counting on their foundation and highest fighting prowess, their comprehensive strength could be comparable to the Sword Sect.

The two were a hundred meters away, and they cupped their hands before unleashing their aura. Their gazes became sharp as they tried to detect the flaws in their opponent’s aura.

In the end, Cheng Xiong took the lead and charged forth. As two afterimages crossed each other in mid-air, they soon clashed together. One used a longspear while the other used an axe, and their battle was ferocious. They were both at the eighth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and their dragon pulses were a thousand feet. Furthermore, they had just entered the top five thousandths on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

But because the Dragon Pulse Ranking didn’t take age into concern, there were many people in their two hundreds or three hundreds on the ranking. Outside Thunderblood Square, any one of them could be considered a monstrous genius to the outside world.

Half a stick of incense later, Cheng Xiong, who used an axe, won the battle. The two made a good start during the Martial Dao Tea Party. Then, more geniuses began to go on the stage. Occasionally, there were even several battles ongoing at the same time.

The stage covered in saint blood became heated, and in some battles, the geniuses even summoned their constellations. There were various ghost spirit martial techniques unleashing various phenomena, opening the horizon for many people.

On the Sword Sect’s side, Zhao Yan, Gu Ruochen, Gongsun Yan, and others also went on the stage. But aside from Zhao Yan, everyone else lost. This wasn’t surprising because everyone here was a genius on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, and it hadn’t even been a year since they returned from the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

They already performed well in the fact that they could fight with these geniuses on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. If they had more time, they would definitely grow up in the future, not to mention Zhao Yan won.

“That fellow is still the same as before.” Under the bamboo hat, Lin Yun muttered as he looked at Zhao Yan.

Zhao Yan’s pupils had no focus. He was clearly standing on the stage, but he looked as though he was asleep, and his previous victory seemed like an insignificant matter to him.

Lin Yun believed that if Zhao Yan grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent one day, he would definitely be able to grasp the Sword Heart, based on his obsession with the sword dao.

As the tea party continued, even the holy lands’ geniuses went on the stage. But the main representative of each holy land was cautious, and they were waiting as if they had a competition to see who could hold back the longest.

Lin Yun had no interest in the other sects. A few more people from the Sword Sect went on the stage, and they all lost without exception. Even Mu Xueqin lost; her opponent was Cheng Xiong, who fought in the first round.

Lin Yun furrowed his brows because the Sword Sect still needed time to grow, since their golden generation from two decades ago had been wiped out. As a result, they didn’t have any top-tiered Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses, and the new generation still needed time.

“Is this the level of the Sword Sect?” Cheng Xiong smiled after winning several rounds. He continued, “It’s not satisfying enough. Does anyone else still want to fight me?”

Naturally, people would pick on the weak, and Cheng Xiong was such a person. The Sword Sect’s comprehensive strength might not be strong, but they have a terrifying foundation. After all, no one in the Eastern Desolation hadn’t heard of the Radiant Sword Saint’s name. Thus, defeating the Sword Sect gave Cheng Xiong a sense of accomplishment, and his provocation attracted the attention of many people.

“Jian Jingtian is in the Samsara Edict Realm, while Flower Burial is nowhere to be seen. Without a leading figure, the Sword Sect is a little lacking.”

“Speaking of which, this Martial Dao Tea Party is so lively because of Jian Jingtian. But the Sword Sect doesn’t have the slightest sense of existence now.”

“With the departure of Jian Jingtian and Flower Burial going into hiding, the Radiant Sword Saint doesn’t have a proper successor.” Someone discussed in a low voice. But most people only had pity on their faces, and didn’t look down on the Sword Sect. They just found it a pity that the Sword Sect had declined so far that even someone like Cheng Xiong could provoke them.

If Jian Jingtian were here, even if the Four Young Masters and six holy lands’ geniuses joined forces, they wouldn’t even dare to let out a fart.

The faces of the Sword Sect’s party were ugly, and just when Ye Ziling couldn’t hold back any longer, a figure landed on the Thunderblood Battlestage. He was Zhao Yan, and he said, “Let me face you.”

Without hesitation, Zhao Yan drew his sword and charged at Cheng Xiong. When the sword and axe clashed, sparks flew around. After exchanging ten-odd moves, Cheng Xiong held onto the axe and dashed forth again.

Unleashing his cultivation at the eighth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm made Zhao Yan suffer a disadvantage. Before the axe even landed on him, the shockwave from the axe alone forced him to take several steps back.

But Zhao Yan ultimately blocked his axe. He was calm and had been searching for the flaw in Cheng Xiong’s attack right from the beginning. When he stabbed his sword at the weak point of Cheng Xiong’s attack, he easily dissolved the latter’s attack.

This made Cheng Xiong shocked, and his attacks became even more ferocious. Cheng Xiong might hold the advantage in the fight on the surface, but Zhao Yan could execute timely attacks and dissolve the dangerous situations he faced. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As time passed, Cheng Xiong’s heart gradually became a mess, and he knew he couldn’t let this carry on any longer.

“Sky Breaking Slash!” Cheng Xiong roared and executed a ghost spirit martial technique with his dragon origin manifesting into a terrifying phenomenon of a giant axe slicing apart the stars with three thousand stars shining brightly.

But to everyone’s surprise, Zhao Yan was calm when facing his attack. He swiftly stabbed his sword with multiple afterimages flying out from his body, and those afterimages swung their sword rays that looked like ink strokes.

“Profound!” When the huge axe descended, an ancient ‘Profound’ word appeared. When the axe fell onto that word, Zhao Yan shook his sword, and Cheng Xiong’s attack was reflected back at him.

This caught Cheng Xiong off guard and he threw out a mouthful of blood in defeat. As he laid on the ground, there was a hideous wound on his chest, and that was from his own axe. He asked, “What sword technique is this…?”
