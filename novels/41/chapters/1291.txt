Chapter 1292 - Gathering

Half an hour later, Lin Yun suddenly came to a stop before a tunnel. He had a feeling something wasn’t right because there were too many chaotic marks on the ground along the way. “Something doesn’t seem right…”

There were signs of fighting in many places, and this meant that there were a lot of people who entered the underground palace. If they were from the powerful sects, it made no sense for their footsteps to be in such a mess. Right at this moment, the entire underground palace began to tremble along with a terrifying aura sweeping over.

A dazzling light also shone from the tunnel before him that made his clothes violently flutter in the wind.

“The appearance of a treasure?” Lin Yun was briefly surprised before he executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformation and turned it into a streak of light. His speed was fast, and when he executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformation, the dragon runes within his body also began to surge.

Each of the dragon runes contained immense power, and even if he didn’t use any movement technique, his speed was still comparable to a bolt of lightning just by relying on pure strength. When the two overlapped, his speed wasn’t inferior to when he summoned the golden wings, and the exhaustion of his origin energy and strength also decreased.

Not long later, Lin Yun arrived at a palace where the light came from. There were countless geniuses gathered at the palace, and they were all Lesser Elysium Core Realm geniuses. There were those from the sects, and there were also demonic cultivators mixed in the group.

At the center of the palace was an altar that emitted a bright light with a passage within. This meant that there was another underground maze beneath this underground maze. There was no question that such a complete ruin was rare on the Profound Wither Island.

Since the people gathered here had different origins, they were already fighting amongst themselves for the entrance. Lin Yun was just silently watching this scene and didn’t dare to make a move. There were many experts at the palace, but there weren’t any geniuses on the level of Bai Luli.

“Weird…” Lin Yun was confused because these people shouldn’t be able to break the seal on the entrance with their strength. The energy lingering in the stone tablet was so terrifying that even he was fearful of it. Without the foundation of a powerful sect, it should be impossible to break through.

But this was a piece of good news to him because he didn’t have to worry about them. So Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to step out and chose to wait.

The palace was filled with energy fluctuations as everyone was fighting amongst themselves. When Lin Yun saw this, he knew that the entrance might really not be opened by the powerful sects. A brief moment later, Lin Yun took out the Silver Moon Mask and put it on.

When he put the Silver Moon Mask on, his black hair began to grow in length before turning silver. Even his azure clothes had turned silver, and his temperament had undergone a complete transformation. This wasn’t because he wanted to conceal his identity, but there was something weird about this underground palace.

The Silver Moon Mask was a powerful saint artifact forged by the Mo Clan, and it could protect his life even if he faced Greater Elysium Core Realm experts. After finding an opportunity, Lin Yun dashed out before leaping towards the altar.

When he saw that the stone gate was still closed, Lin Yun was both surprised and relieved because no one had gone ahead. But when he dashed out, the surrounding experts all stopped with their gazes falling onto Lin Yun.

“You think that we don’t exist?”

“Why waste time with him? You want to take the opportunity while we fight? It’s not that easy!”

“Let’s kill him!” It was natural for them to be furious. After all, they were fighting with their lives on the line, so there was no way they could allow someone to take a step ahead of them.

When Lin Yun saw this scene, he inwardly sneered. If it wasn’t because he wasn’t fond of unnecessarily killing, everyone here would’ve been killed before they even had the chance to speak. Their strength was decent, but they were still too weak compared to Bai Luli and the Flame Dragon Sect. But if they wanted to come after him, he wouldn’t mind teaching them a lesson.

“Hahaha! There’s actually such a place!” Right at that moment, a burst of laughter resounded like a rumbling roar, causing all those who heard it to throw out blood with their faces turning pale.

“Bunch of ants. A fortune of this level isn’t something you people can compete for!” When the voice resounded once more, lightning lit up the entire palace like a bright sun. What followed after were flames and lightning that condensed into a tornado.

In the path of the tornado, everyone was obliterated and even those who managed to survive were heavily slammed against the wall. In just that moment, ten-odd Lesser Elysium Core Realm experts were heavily injured, while everyone else immediately ran away from the tornado.

“What power!” Lin Yun was shocked beneath his mask. He could tell that this person wielded both flame and lightning intent, and he had reached the third grade in both of them. Furthermore, he also managed to perfectly fuse the two martial intents, and the fusion wasn’t weaker than his azure dragon aura and sword aura.

A person was hovering in the sky, looking around with lightning and flames converging in his palm before manifesting a talisman brimming with terrifying power.

“The Sacred Lightning Flame Talisman!”

“He’s Xia Tianzhen of the Thunder Sect!” The noisy palace instantly became silent with everyone trembling in fear. After all, everyone talked with their strength on the Profound Wither Island, and weaklings could only be prey to others, not to mention that they were ants in the eyes of big sect geniuses.

But in the eyes of powerful sects, the big sect disciples were no different from ants. As for Xia Yunzhen, he was also a transcendent genius, it’s just that he was outshone by the stronger Wang Han. Transcendent geniuses weren’t that rare in the powerful sects, unlike the big sects, so it was common for them to have more than one.

Behind Xia Yunzhen was a group of people, and there was even a grey-clothed elder enveloped in a terrifying aura. He was a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert. Judging from their formation, Xia Yunzhen was a lot better than Bai Luli, since even the disciples gathered around him were all at the Lesser Elysium Core Realm, and this wasn’t something the Flame Dragon Sect could be compared to.

After all, the gap between the two was simply too huge. As for the Greater Elysium Core Realm expert, Lin Yun merely took a glance at him and became cautious.

As everyone in the palace backed off, they looked at Xia Yunzhen with their faces turning ugly. They were also at the Elysium Core Realm, but Xia Yunzhen’s astral energy was a lot denser than them. It was like an ocean, and this was the foundation of a powerful sect.

Lin Yun instantly understood that Xia Yunzhen was comparable to Mu Qingqing, who stood beside Sikong Zhou, and could be considered the second strongest amongst the Thunder Sect. Now that all the chief disciples from the powerful sects were refining origin saint runes, this meant that they were practically the ones giving commands now.

“Let’s go. We can’t stay here any longer.” The crowd in the surroundings began to leave after seeing that the Thunder Sect had appeared. But before they could calm themselves, another group of people charged over. They were donned in emerald clothes with elegant temperaments, and they were even emitting a faint emerald light.

“The Emerald Jade Manor!” Everyone could recognize their origin just from their clothes. They were from the Emerald Jade Manor, one of the eight strongest sects in the Ancient Barren Domain.

“Xia Yunzhen, you’re really early,” smiled the youth holding onto a fan standing at the front.

“Fang Muyang, you’re not slow, either.” Xia Yunzhen coldly looked at the youth. As the saying goes, two tigers couldn’t be kept on a mountain. With two powerful sects gathered here, neither of them would let go of this place, and this meant that they would have to compete amongst themselves.

“Likewise, likewise,” smiled Fang Muyang.

“Wow, how bustling. Looks like my Heavenly Blade Pavilion isn’t late!” Just when the Thunder Sect and Emerald Jade Manor were facing off, another group of people entered, and this instantly left everyone in the palace dumbfounded.

The Profound Wither Island was massive, and it was enough for the eight strongest sects to look for treasures. So just what was this place where three of the eight strongest sects gathered here? After all, it would be unwise for them to fight amongst themselves right now when the great saint origin hadn’t appeared.

With the three sects here, the situation suddenly became confusing. Not long later, the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s group entered under the lead of a black-clothed youth. They had a huge formation, and they also had a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert.

“Ye Xun!” Fang Muyang and Xia Yunzhen both had fear flashing across their pupils when they saw the black-clothed youth. This person was strong, and his strength was close to those transcendent geniuses ranked in the top ten.

When the three sects faced off, they were releasing their auras, making the surrounding atmosphere as tense as a volcano that would erupt at any moment. This made everyone’s hearts tremble and they even began to regret coming here.

Even if they leave the palace right now, they would still be affected by the aura released by the three sects, so none of them dared to make a move. In the end, they could only tremble in fear since they would be the first to die if the three sects fought here.

“I came here first, so get lost!” Xia Yunzhen had a fiery temper because of his martial intents, so he immediately yelled at the other two.

“Haha, since when did ‘first come first serve’ ever work in this world?” Fang Muyang wore a mocking smile. No one would try to reason on the Profound Wither Island, not to mention that the Thunder Sect was known for their fiery temper.

“If anyone wants to move, you’ll have to ask if my blade agrees.” Ye Xun said in a domineering tone.

“You think I’m afraid of you?” Xia Yunzhen sneered, and the talisman in his hand began to flicker with lightning. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Fang Muyang also sneered as purple light manifested into an ancient tablet behind him.

The Heavenly Blade Pavilion had the Heavenly Blade Art, the Emerald Jade Manor had the Lesser Phase Divine Art, and the Thunder Sect had the Sacred Lightning Flame Art, so no one was willing to bow to another. But if a fight really broke out amongst them here, everyone else in the palace would be killed.

Just when everyone was feeling uneasy, an explosion resounded. Lin Yun had quickly smashed the stone gate with a kick. His action left the three transcendents briefly stunned before they flew into a rage. They couldn’t believe that someone actually wanted to go in first while they were here!

“You guys can continue to discuss amongst yourselves while I take my leave first,” said Lin Yun before he entered the passage.
