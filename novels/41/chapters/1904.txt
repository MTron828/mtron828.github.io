Chapter 1905 - First Level

Lin Yun began to panic when his dragon origin and sword intent went out of control. The Blood Crows were ahead, and he didn’t dare to fly into the air. Meanwhile, the woman of unknown origin was closely following behind him.

“That fellow will probably fall!” Everyone else on the chains looked at Ye Qingtian from afar, wearing gloating expressions. After all, falling wouldn’t feel good. Down below was a vortex of sword intent, and one would suffer severe injuries even if they wouldn’t die.

They merely glanced at Ye Qingtian before they continued on. Judging from their response, it was as though they didn’t see that woman.

The more the chain shook, the more Lin Yun couldn’t calm himself, and the footsteps behind him were getting closer. The chains suddenly shook violently, and a scream resounded from his back. It was the woman who fell from the chain.

Lin Yun’s face changed, and he turned around, reaching down with his hand. In the critical moment, he grabbed onto the woman’s hand. When he held onto her hand, he couldn’t help feeling a little dizzy when he looked down.

It wasn’t because he was afraid of heights, but the woman didn’t seem to wear anything beneath her sackcloth clothes. He could see a massive patch of skin shaking along with the chain, which was why Lin Yun felt dizzy.

Gritting his teeth, Lin Yun forced himself to regain consciousness and pulled the woman up with all his strength. When the woman stabilized herself, she collided into Lin Yun’s embrace, and Lin Yun subconsciously embraced her before they both fell.

But just when Lin Yun was about to fall, he grabbed the chain at a critical moment. But a suction force from below felt like a pair of invisible hands tugging them down.

“Ha. We’re finished now. Why don’t you leave me behind? The fall won’t kill anyone, anyways,” the woman smiled in Lin Yun’s embrace.

“That works.” Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to loosen his grip and allowed the woman to fall.

The woman was shocked and was already falling before she could even respond. Now that he was alone, Lin Yun returned to the chain with a flip. When he stabilized, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. When he reopened his eyes, his dragon origin and sword intent became calm within his body, and his gaze was pure when he looked at the Blood Crow.

“It’s that woman who was behind this,” Lin Yun muttered to himself, and he continued.

But when he took a step, a figure soared to the sky, and the woman firmly landed on the chain, looking at Lin Yun. “You’re really ruthless.”

This made Lin Yun furrow his brows, but he continued. Roughly half an incense of time later, Lin Yun landed on the ground and walked towards the palace with the Blood Crow. Pushing apart the gates, Lin Yun saw countless words written on the wall. Those words were profound, like numerous people swinging their swords, instantly captivating Lin Yun’s attention.

“Leave a word behind to make it through the trial.” An ethereal voice echoed within the palace. When Lin Yun came to his senses, the ancient words in front of him disappeared.

Turning around, he couldn’t see anyone. He didn’t dwell in that for long and carried on forth to see a table leaning against the wall ahead. Incense was burning on the table with paper and ink by the side.

Lin Yun was familiar with this trial. Others might be able to see the sword techniques, but they needed help remembering the trajectory. One word was a sword, and writing involved testing eyesight. The Carefree 9 Swords that Lin Yun practiced were much more challenging than this, and he didn’t hesitate to raise the brush and write down a word.

This was an ‘Ancient’ word. Lin Yun didn’t recognize it, but he remembered the intent and profundity contained within it. So he casually wrote it down, and the wall opened when he was done.

“Isn’t this a little too easy?” Lin Yun muttered to himself, and he walked over.

When he came out, he found himself in a palace above the clouds, with another flight of stairs ahead. But there were more saint disciples here, probably trapped here. The moment he appeared, everyone was instantly dumbfounded as they looked at him.

“Isn’t this a little too fast?”

“How did he manage to do it so quickly?”

“He’s not at the Nirvana Stage, right?”

“Is he really Ye Qingtian?” Everyone was shocked as they looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.

The woman came over and was surprised as she looked at Lin Yun, “How did you manage to do it? Aren’t you a little too fast?”

“Didn’t you make it through as well?” Lin Yun asked.

“Have you forgotten that I have already made it through the four trials of the first level? So I naturally won’t have to attempt the trials again,” the woman smiled.

Lin Yun glanced at her, then immediately ignored her, walking toward the stairs.

The Celestial Purging Mountain should have nine levels, with four trials in each stage. This corresponds to the nine levels of heavens in the Kunlun Realm and the thirty-six layers of heavens of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. If one can go beyond the thirty-six layers, they will grasp the Astral Sword Intent… Lin Yun inwardly muttered and roughly knew what the Dragon Origin Great Saint meant. That also meant that he had one more trial to make it through the first level.

Chen Feng was only an inner disciple, and he didn’t know much because he couldn’t even make it through the first trial at the first level.

“This is the last trial on the first level, and there are 999 flights of stairs. Everyone gathered here because none of them were confident about it. So are you sure that you want to start right away?” The woman asked.

Lin Yun didn’t bother with the woman because he didn’t want to form any sort of connection with her. But it was just as she said. When he climbed the stairs, he could feel an invisible aura crashing down, and the pressure increased with every footstep, which nearly crushed his dragon origin.

The fact that Lin Yun could make it so far was already impressive to many people. His cultivation could not support him this far, and he relied on his sword intent.

He resisted the pressure with his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. But he could sense his Sword Heart being tempered whenever he stepped forth. When he came to the eight-hundredth flight of stairs, he suddenly saw a figure descending towards him.

This person was covered in blood, but he didn’t give up and grabbed onto the flight of stairs with his teeth gritting. But this only made his injuries even more severe, making everyone’s faces change as they quickly ducked to the side.

After all, this person was enveloped in sword intent and rolling down like a snowball. If this person slammed into them, they would fail the trials immediately.

But Lin Yun didn’t duck after seeing the person falling in his direction. When this person was about to slam into him, he circulated his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent and reached out, grabbing that person’s back. When the two sword intents clashed, everyone raised their heads and looked at Lin Yun with shock.

After Lin Yun stabilized this person, he continued forth.

“Grasping the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at the Profound Death Stage. Since when is there such a talented swordsman within the Heavenly Dao Sect? Which saint’s disciple is he from?” A grey-robed man walked over.

When Lin Yun turned around, he was inwardly shocked because he was an expert at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. Not only that, but Lin Yun could also sense a dense death aura being emitted from this person. This death aura was familiar, it felt similar to the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, but it was also different.

“Indigo Thunder Peak’s Ye Qingtian,” Lin Yun said casually.

“Ye Qingtian?” That youth couldn’t find any impression of this name. He said, “Don’t try to save everyone on the flight of stairs, or you might fail.”

When he finished, he swiftly surpassed Lin Yun and continued forth.

Lin Yun shook his head. He still wanted to chat with this person, but he never expected that this person would depart after leaving behind a reminder. But he wasn’t too bothered about it and swiftly reached the summit of the stairs.

There was a sword at the cliffside, and the sword aura came from this sword. A person was also seated beside the sword, donned in a white robe. He looked exactly like the gatekeeper of the first trial.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At the base of the Celestial Purging Mountain, Chen Feng was emotional when he saw Ye Qingtian’s name appearing on the monument. This meant that he had successfully ascended the first level.

“Senior Brother is Senior Brother for a reason, to ascend the peak in just four hours. This is too unbelievable!” Chen Feng said in an excited tone. “Senior Brother should’ve broken the record. After all, he’s only at the Profound Death Stage!”

Everyone in the surrounding area was also shocked because they had long noticed that. They had to admit that Ye Qingtian’s performance was a little unbelievable.

“Chen Zhong is also here!”

“Look at that name beside Ye Qingtian!”

The gaze of Chen Feng fell onto another name on the monument.

“Who’s Chen Zhong?” Chen Feng asked.
