Chapter 1014 - Nine Radiant Suns!

Divine Glorysun Sword—Cloud Dispelling Sun!

As Lin Yun was enveloped by a bright sun, the crowd could barely see. This was the sun that accompanied Lin Yun’s boundless sword intent. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Standing on the sword box, Lin Yun turned into a golden crow and charged towards Mo Xuan and Han Lei with a domineering aura.

“He took the initiative to attack? Is he planning to suppress the Profound Lightning Twin Swords?”

“Holy shit. The Profound Lightning Twin Swords are geniuses from a war realm… they’re forbidden existences…”

“This is too insane.” Many people couldn’t believe the legend unfolding in front of them.

“You’re courting death!” Mo Xuan and Han Lei’s eyes flashed with a ruthless light as Lin Yun charged over. Did he really consider them as pushovers? Wasn’t he underestimating the Elysium Trigram War Realm a little too much?

Enraged, they released a terrifying aura as they tore Lin Yun’s cloak to pieces. Then, they began to form an ancient seal together while their aura oceans boiled, “Let’s go all out! He has to die no matter what!”

The lightning runes in their aura oceans turned into an ancient flower. When the lightning flower bloomed, their origin energy turned red. At this moment, the lightning was turning into flames.

Even Mo Xuan and Han Lei’s bodies turned red as crimson lightning flickering on their bodies. They were attracting everyone’s attention because of their terrifying aura.

The lightning runes in their aura oceans were the trump cards of the Elysium Trigram War Realm, which meant that Lin Yun was really strong to force them to this point. “Lin Yun, you can die with pride since you forced us this far!”

Soon, the lightning flames behind them began to form two massive swords. When the massive swords were formed, the astral energy in the air began to burn. At this moment, Han Lei and Mo Xuan looked like they were one with the swords.

This was their combination attack and trump card that they practiced to high proficiency. With a roar, they charged at Lin Yun, “Die!”

“Undying Profound Light, Space Tremor Lightning!”

“Heavenly Earth Trigram, Undying Divine Flame!” Their power created a hurricane of a few hundred feet that flew towards Lin Yun. Within the hurricane, Mo Xuan and Han Lei’s gazes were cold.

“Holy…” When the crowd saw the attack, they wished that Lin Yun hadn’t charged over. They were certain that he would be heavily injured.

“A combination attack…” Lin Yun felt threatened by the hurricane and the killing intent that was inside of it. He could tell that this attack was strong since it was a perfect combination of two imperial fortune martial techniques. Clearly, the Elysium Trigram War Realm couldn’t be underestimated.

“What a shame, you guys are still lacking!” Lin Yun wore a smile as azure-purple sword rays poured out of his body. When the sword ray reached its limit, the entire heaven began to tremble with the swing of Lin Yun’s sword.

Just like that, everyone watched as Lin Yun faced Mo Xuan and Han Lei’s combination attack all by himself. In the next second, an explosion as all three swords clashed.

There were many rumors that Lin Yun had grasped the sky sword intent, which was something that even an empyrean would have difficulty reaching. So it felt like a dream for the crowd as they witnessed Lin Yun unleash the sky sword intent while in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

“Disperse!” Lin Yun’s brows locked together as cold light flashed in his eyes. They better be prepared to pay the price if they want to kill me! Lin Yun didn’t stop after facing Mo Xuan and Han Lei’s attack. He soared straight into the sky and executed Eastern Purple Aura and Rising Flames.

His attacks tore the hurricane to pieces, which sent Mo Xuan and Han Lei flying over a hundred meters. Their faces were ugly because their combination attack was stopped once again.

Blood dripped from the hands that they used to wield their swords. The trump card that they used was enough to kill a third of the crowd, but their efforts went down the drain after encountering Lin Yun’s sky sword intent. Where did this monster come from?

“You guys dare to call yourselves forbidden existences with such weak means?” Lin Yun looked at Mo Xuan and Han Lei with ridicule in his eyes.

“Flower Burial, don’t push it!” Mo Xuan said with a sunken face. “No one can save you in the Heavenly Path if you offend our Elysium Trigram War Realm. Don’t push it and get lost while you still can!”

When Lin Yun heard that, the rage in his eyes grew stronger. He was so disgusted with Mo Xuan and Han Lei, but especially with Mo Xuan. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun charged forward once more, “Don’t push it? So what if I push it?!”

Hanging Sun!

Lin Yun swung his sword out once more as his attack formed a massive rainbow beam. He looked just like a fiend who came from the sun.

Mo Xuan and Han Lei were suppressed by Lin Yun, so they were doing their best to resist him. But no matter what they did, their efforts were futile. At this moment, their legendary status as geniuses from the war realms was completely destroyed. Plus, Lin Yun’s aura was stronger than theirs and even caused the entire Yellow Sandy Plain to tremble. The power of his attack empowered by the sky sword intent had exceeded everyone’s imagination.

“We can’t hold it any longer! We have to leave!”

“Damn it, this bastard is too arrogant! We have to teach him a lesson when the young master gets here!” Han Lei and Mo Xuan’s faces were upset. Since they came to the Heavenly Path, they had never been so humiliated or suppressed. Normally, no one would dare to provoke them.

But now, they were treated like a joke by Lin Yun. They felt especially grieved because they looked like they were full of hot air. Without hesitation, Han Lei and Mo Xuan manipulated their massive swords to block Lin Yun’s attack.

Their swords were like a gigantic mountain that formed a barrier against Lin Yun.

“Lin Yun, the young masters will arrive soon. You can dream about reaching the Four Phase City alive. You’ll die for offending the Elysium Trigram War Realm!” They hurled constant threats at Lin Yun now that they were behind a makeshift barrier.

“Did I permit either of you to leave?” Lin Yun replied indifferently as he swung his sword out with nine suns rising behind him. The entire sky had turned red with flames before Lin Yun finished swinging his sword.

Under the nine suns, all vitality was being robbed from the surroundings and even the astral energy in the air was being incinerated. This was the strongest attack of the Divine Glorysun Sword. When the nine suns filled the horizon, a dazzling sword ray shot out like a spear towards the barrier, instantly tearing it apart.

Just like that, everyone watched as Han Lei and Mo Xuan’s gigantic swords crumbled. At this moment, they were full of fear.

When Lin Yun looked at Mo Xuan, he didn’t have any hesitation to charge over and swing his sword, “Die!”

“N-n-no!” Mo Xuan exclaimed in fear as he used all of his strength to fend off the attack. But when Lin Yun’s attack landed, his armor and clothes were destroyed in a split second.
