Chapter 1177 - Let Me Bear It

Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lin Yun’s face was dark and sullen when he returned to his residence, still feeling depressed from what happened in the main hall.

“Lin Yun, you’re too impulsive…” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun for a long time before she continued, “Perhaps that old geezer has other objectives.”

“Indeed, I was a little too much. But it doesn’t matter since we can’t agree,” sighed Lin Yun.

“Logically speaking, he isn’t wrong. After all, you gave him your promise first. Otherwise, the old geezer wouldn’t have forced you to do it.” Lil’ Purple tried to persuade Lin Yun. Although she didn’t like that old geezer, she could tell that the old geezer wasn’t bad and just had a foul temper.

“This has nothing to do with right and wrong. We just can’t agree,” said Lin Yun. Now, he could understand what Ye Ziling felt because he knew what the ranking battle meant to her. This was the same as his promise to Xin Jue back then, but that old man called it fooling around.

He heard from Ye Ziling that her father wasn’t bothered with the ranking battle. So it was easy for Lin Yun to understand how she felt.

“You’re only a passerby,” said Lil’ Purple.

“I know.” Lin Yun didn’t try to refute those words as he reminisced about the past before he continued, “I have experienced too much, and I know that we might not meet again if I turn around. But this is also why I enjoy the present. I might be a passerby, but I’m also a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.”

“Do you want to talk to Ye Ziling about it?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Forget it. Let me bear it…” Lin Yun shook his head after a brief pondering. He knew that Ye Ziling wouldn’t blame him if he told her that, but she would definitely blame it on the sect master. At that time, there might even be a possibility that she would cut her relationship with the sect master.

The sect master let out a sigh in the main hall before he looked at Luo Hua with a stiffened expression, “Sorry for making you watch something so embarrassing.”

“Embarrassing? I believe I need an explanation,” said Luo Hua coldly.

The sect master was stunned when he heard that because he never expected that Luo Hua would be so rude. But the aura she gave off made it feel like it was a normal response and that she was someone of a higher status. Furthermore, the sect master was surprised to hear the unhappiness in Luo Hua’s tone.

The sect master squinted his eyes and smiled, “Young Master Luo, it seems like you’re not happy that I’m forcing Lin Yun?”

“He might be a passerby based on your point of view, and the ranking battle is just a waste of time. The Sword Assembly will surely benefit him more, and he’ll also be able to become the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple smoother when a year is up…” Luo Hua said indifferently. “You’re doing this for him, so his promise to Ye Ziling might be nothing in your eyes. But do you remember his first words when he entered?”

The sect master squinted his eyes when he heard that because he remembered that Lin Yun had addressed himself as a disciple, a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. This made his heart tremble with shock on his face because he naturally knew the difference between the two.

“He’s only in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect for half a year, and he already treats himself like a disciple. You’ve been here for nearly 18 years, but you’ve never considered yourself the sect master of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Your heart is overwhelmed with hatred, and you’ve been living in Jian Jingtian’s shadows and living under the name of the Radiant Sword Saint.” Luo Hua continued indifferently. She knew how breathtaking the sect master of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was back then. His name was Jian Jingtian and he was deemed as the one who could bring honor back to the Sword Sect with his immense talent.

“You know a lot.” The sect master looked at Luo Hua before he continued, “But why do I, Jian Jingtian, need you to teach me? I never consider right and wrong. You can forget it if you want me to apologize to him, even if you’re a friend of my master!”

Seeing how stubborn the sect master was, Luo Hua was speechless. He clearly knew that he was in the wrong, but he was too stubborn. Then again, Lin Yun was the same.

The ranking battle wasn’t just a great event for the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but also for the Suspend King Palace, Azure Thunder Monastery, and Thousand Crane Pavilion as well.

On a practicing field in the Suspend King Palace, Chu Haotian trained by facing two quasi-Elysium Core Realm deacons. He emitted a terrifying monarch aura that pressured the deacons.

Half of their cultivation was restricted, and they couldn’t exhibit their full strength. At the same time, an ancient word had appeared beneath Chu Tianhao, taking the form of “王”. But every brush and stroke was emitting killing intent that rippled out like a shockwave.

Enveloped in the ripples, Chu Tianhao shined brightly as every single of his movements felt like a monarch descending from the sky. Ten moves later, he let out a bark and dazzling lightning exploded that sent the deacons flying. They even had to take several steps back before they managed to stabilize themselves.

“The Suspend King Ancient Seal!” The deacons saw a black light enveloping Chu Tianhao that was engraved with an ancient seal. They were sent flying by the seal. It was the highest level of the Suspend King Art, and grasping that secret technique could allow Chu Tianhao to kill his opponents who were in a higher realm than him.

It had been centuries since anyone had achieved it in the Suspend King Palace. Truly, Chu Tianhao was worthy of being called the strongest genius in the Profound Azure Prefecture.

“Good!” An old man appeared.

Upon seeing the old man, the two deacons immediately cupped their hands together, “Greetings, Palace Master!”

“Tianhao, you’ve finally reached the 12th stage in the Suspend King Art, and right before the ranking battle too.” The old man wore a smile with excitement flashing in the depth of his pupils.

Chu Tianhao merely smiled, “I have a feeling that the Suspend King Art still has another stage.”

“Oh?” This time, even the palace master was surprised.

“Forming the Monarch Ancient Seal only allows me to touch the surface of monarch intent,” said Chu Tianhao.

“The monarch intent?” The palace master was shocked when he heard that. After all, the monarch intent was ranked as a top dao, which was also called a sovereign dao. If one managed to comprehend it, they could confront any other martial intent in the third stage.

“Just the surface of it.” Chu Tianhao smiled and continued, “But it’s more than enough for me to sweep through the Profound Azure Prefecture.”
