Chapter 2183 - I’m Not Worthy?

A sword that comes and goes without leaving behind any traces. Even if there were thirty-six layers of heavenly screens, sacred flames, and Threespirit Glory Saint Artifacts, one sword from Lin Yun was enough.

The surroundings fell into a dead silence, and even breathing couldn’t be heard. Even Saint Realm experts were shocked as well.

“He defeated Wang Zai with one sword?”

“Isn’t this a little too unbelievable? Wang Zai’s cultivation was the pinnacle of the Sacred Flame Stage!”

“Even the Thunder Dragon Whip can’t stop him.”

“How did Ye Qingtian become so strong? Even if he went to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, he’s only at the Indigo Origin Phase, grasping only the Wind and Thunder Daos.”

“It’s too unbelievable, not to mention that he hasn’t grasped the Sword Dao!” An uproar broke out after everyone came to their senses, and many people couldn’t accept this outcome.

“H-How is this possible?” The Gale Rein Great Saint was dumbfounded. Just a moment ago, he was still laughing at the Thousand Plume Great Saint for having a bad eyesight, but now he didn’t dare to say a word.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint sneered, “I already said that there’s no way to control him once he attacks.”

Looking at the sneer on Thousand Plume Great Saint’s face, the Gale Rein Great Saint clenched his right fist. But he ultimately endured it since it wasn’t time for it.

This scene shocked everyone, including the Dao Yang Holy Son and Holy Spirit Son. The Holy Spirit Son said, “Ye Qingtian’s improvements during this period of time are greater than us.”

“He’s one of us, so there’s nothing to worry about,” the Dao Yang Holy Son smiled. The two were disciples of the Thousand Plume Great Saint, and the resources they received during this period was more than what Lin Yun received. In just half a month, their strength had undergone a huge boost.

One of them was in the light, while the other was in the dark. They both held the hope of the Thousand Plume Great Saint. As long as they weren’t dead, the Heavenly Dao Sect would flourish once more in the future, and that was the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s remaining obsession.

All the guests who came were also surprised, and the mysterious guest wearing a cloak softly spoke with the few behind him. This person was mysterious, and those who came with him were wearing cloaks as well. Their actual appearances couldn’t be seen. They were discussing the battle earlier.

There were various discussions in the surrounding area, but no one sympathized with Wang Zai. Ye Qingtian’s sword was brutal, but the disciples from the seventy-two peaks were happy. After all, someone as arrogant as Wang Zai should be taught a lesson, thinking that they could rule the sect just because they were from the Wang Clan. Because of that, everyone had been holding back their anger.

“That brat’s Astral Sword Intent has improved, and it has reached a point where he can’t improve any further,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. Beside her were the Serene Dust Great Saint and Azure River Sword Saint, and they all had a noble status within the sect, standing on the same level as that cloaked person. But Ye Guhan didn’t pay any attention to Lin Yun but was focused on that cloaked figure with a complicated gaze.

With Wang Zai’s defeat, the competition of the Upper Nine Peaks had come to an end. The Thousand Plume Great Saint publicly announced that Indigothunder Peak had become the champion, and Ye Qingtian possessed the qualifications to offer the incense.

When the Indigothunder Peak Master saw this scene, he felt as though he was dreaming, and he couldn’t believe what he saw. Indigothunder Peak is the champion, just like that? With one sword?

After seeing Lin Yun looking at him with a bitter smile, the Indigothunder Peak Master also expressed that he was helpless. As he stroked his beard, he wore a comforted look, and smiled, “That brat… managed to show off again.”

The ceremony resumed, and they had reached the crucial part, which was recalling the Emperor Sword. In the past, this section was called the Emperor Ceremony, but the Emperor Sword wouldn’t return no matter how often they tried, and there wasn’t even a response from the Emperor Sword.

This scene was a little awkward, so the Heavenly Dao Sect changed the name of the Emperor Ceremony to the Heavenly Dao Ceremony. As a result, the summoning ceremony of the Emperor Sword was now a formality, and no one felt that the Emperor Sword would return.

During the ceremony, the Dao Yang Holy Son and Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden paid their respects to the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword. The two swords gave them face and responded along with the ceremony, releasing dazzling radiances that covered thousands of miles of the sky.

“As long as the two swords exist, the Heavenly Dao Sect will exist for eternity!” The Heavenly Dao Sect’s Saints and disciples all felt proud from the bottom of their hearts when they saw the radiance that the two swords were releasing. Even Yu Qingfeng couldn’t withstand the two swords back then. It was the Southern Emperor who had to make a move for them to retreat.

The guests from the other holy lands also wore solemn expressions. Various holy lands had their treasures guarding them, but even their treasures were pale in comparison to the two swords. It had been over three thousand years since the swords made a move, and there were rumors that the two swords had already left Heavenly Dao Sect. But the two swords would respond with each ceremony, releasing their radiance.

Most of the holy lands were here to confirm the existence of the two swords. But if the two swords didn’t respond one day, it would be the fall of the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“How are the two swords compared to the Divine Phoenix Mirror of my Divine Phoenix Mountain?” Ji Zixi said in an unconvincing tone as she looked at the elder beside her.

The elder smiled, “The two swords cannot be compared to the Divine Phoenix Mirror if they’re separated. But there aren’t many opponents in the world if the two swords joined forces. However, the treasure of my Divine Phoenix Mountain isn’t any weaker than them.”

“Hmph,” Ji Zixi snorted because that was the same as saying nothing. That wasn’t the answer she wanted.

“Haha. There’s one factor where the Divine Phoenix Mirror is better than the two swords,” the old man smiled. “The Divine Phoenix Mirror made a move multiple times, but the two swords haven’t even made a move once.”

Far from the altar, there were two people standing on a mountain, looking at the radiance released by the two swords. These two were Zhao Tianyu and Gu Xinyu.

“So the two swords really do exist,” Gu Xinyu muttered to himself, looking at the radiance with fear in his eyes.

“They have always been around.” Zhao Tianyu was calmer than Gu Xinyu. If it wasn’t for the two swords, the Blood Moon Sect would’ve made a move long ago. But without the Emperor Sword or a sect master, the two swords wouldn’t appear on their own initiative, even if the Heavenly Dao Sect was facing destruction.

To control the two swords, one had to be the sect master or possess the Emperor Sword, but it was best to have both. But the Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t have a sect master nor the Emperor Sword, so this meant that the two swords wouldn’t appear.

There had been rumors that the two swords were protecting the Eastern Desolation and not just the Heavenly Dao Sect. A hundred years ago, the Blood Moon Sect sent an Emperor Realm expert to verify this speculation. In that battle, the Heavenly Dao Sect lost a Great Saint, but the two swords didn’t show up.

Compared to the two swords, Zhao Tianyu paid more attention to the Emperor Sword instead because this ceremony was to bring the Emperor Sword back. If the Emperor Sword returns, it could control the two swords even without a sect master. Just the existence of the Emperor Sword alone was enough to ruin their plans, but the outcome made Zhao Tianyu heave a sigh of relief because the Emperor Sword was nowhere to be seen, and there wasn’t even any response.

“I’m unworthy?” The Dao Yang Holy Son bit onto his lips with reluctance in his eyes. He normally had a smile on his face, and he could smile even when facing death. But he couldn’t smile at this moment. He once heard from Tian Xing that although Ye Qingtian failed to bring the Emperor Sword back, the latter had seen the sword. But when it was his turn, he couldn’t even get a response from the Emperor Sword. This naturally made him feel terrible.

“Senior Brother, it’s time for us to leave. There’s nothing worthy or unworthy because this has become the norm over the thousands of years. Perhaps the Emperor Sword no longer exists,” Wang Muyan smiled.

She was here to comfort the Dao Yang Holy Son, but the latter muttered, “That’s not the case, that’s not…”

The Dao Yang Holy Son didn’t carry on as he muttered to himself while leaving with his head lowered. With the ceremony coming to an end, everyone heaved a sigh of relief, and even the Gale Rein Great Saint wore a smile on his face.

As for the Thousand Plume Great Saint, he sighed and turned to look at Ye Qingtian. Perhaps they might still have a chance if Ye Qingtian gives it a try. He said, “Ye Qingtian, you go and give it a try.”

The disciples who were about to put away the ceremonial items were briefly stunned. The Dao Yang Holy Son also came to his senses, and he chased them to the side, “Don’t move.”

“Senior Brother, what are you doing?” Wang Muyan asked.

The Dao Yang Holy Son smiled, “It’s fine. Let Ye Qingtian give it a try. It’s the same as keeping everything after he’s done offering the incense.”

The Gale Rein Great Saint’s face sank when he heard that because the process of offering the incense was the last step. But the Thousand Plume Great Saint was the one hosting the ceremony, so there was nothing he could do about it.

The Gale Rein Great Saint turned to look at a black-clothed elder not far away. The elder gave off a powerful aura, surrounded by experts of the Ye Clan. This person was the ancestor of the Ye Clan, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign.

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign noticed the Gale Rein Great Saint’s gaze, and he nodded with a cold smile.

“Ye Qingtian, what are you waiting for?” The Thousand Plume Great Saint roared.

Ye Qingtian was baffled since he had no idea what was going on, but he could only stand up.

Seeing this, the Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled, “Ye Qingtian, since you’re in charge of offering the incense, you might as well try and see if you can bring the Emperor Sword back.”

The moment he said that, there was an uproar in the surrounding area. After all, the ceremony of recalling the Emperor Sword was important, and not just anyone could do it.

Lin Yun bitterly smiled because he would bring the Emperor Sword back if he could, but he had already tried once, and failed. The Emperor Sword was a little afraid of him, and it would retreat whenever he reached out. In the end, the Emperor Sword chased him away.

“Ye Qingtian, give it a try,” the Dao Yang Holy Son joined in.

Lin Yun wasn’t in a position to refuse, so he could only walk towards the altar. Once he had reached the center, he climbed the steps, and looked at the Thousand Plume Great Saint.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled, “Ye Qingtian might not be a holy son, but he’s a saint disciple of my Heavenly Dao Sect and the Heavenly Dragon Lord. It’s not against the rules to let him try, and I believe no one will object to this, right?”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The surroundings fell silent with everyone discussing amongst themselves. It felt a little weird, but no one found anything wrong with it. After all, the ceremony to bring the Emperor Sword back was only a formality, and nothing would change even if Ye Qingtian gave it a try, not to mention after hearing what the Thousand Plume Great Saint said.

“I object!” Right then, a roar disrupted the silence. It came from the ancestor of the Ye Clan, Tough Peak Saint Sovereign.

Everyone was shocked as they looked at the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign, who pointed at Ye Qingtian, and said, “There’s nothing wrong with it if he’s really a saint disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect. But he’s not a saint disciple of my Heavenly Dao Sect! The real Ye Qingtian is dead, and his true identity is the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, Flower Burial Lin Yun!”
