Chapter 2217: Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain

The Dao Yang Holy Son was defeated with just one sword, regardless of his earlier advantage. The defeat was a huge blow, causing the Dao Yang Holy Son to bitterly smile, “I finally know why you didn’t use your sword initially.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered and explained, “It’s actually not that unbelievable. I wouldn’t have been able to defeat you with one sword if we fought for real. I might not have used my sword, but I have been observing your martial techniques and saint dao. So the moment I drew my sword, I aimed to end the battle instantly.”

He was speaking the truth because he nearly fell into danger. After all, the Dao Yang Holy Son’s Devour Dao was troublesome.

“You don’t have to comfort me,” Dao Yang Holy Son smiled. “I can tell that your sword was invincible, and you have fused the Divine Firefly Sword into your soul. I can no longer see any traces of it.”

“That’s right,” Lin Yun smiled. The Divine Firefly Sword was divided into three sections, and he had already transformed the first two sections into his, making them a part of his body. That was especially the case after he comprehended Yu Qingfeng’s understanding of this sword technique, and the current Divine Firefly Sword now looked different.

Furthermore, his comprehension was above that, and Yu Qingfeng’s shadows could no longer be seen in this sword technique. This might seem like one sword, but it overlapped the power of the two sections.

“One last question. I already consumed your sword aura, so how could you bring it back out with a single thought?” The Dao Yang Holy Son asked. This was why he dared to let Lin Yun draw his sword. After all, a swordsman’s strength would fall if they suffered a setback, which was more serious than suffering injuries. This was because even if a swordsman was injured, they could still fight as long as they had their sword. But it was a different story if their sword aura was destroyed.

Lin Yun sighed as he looked at the pavilion, “Senior Tian Xing gave me a lamp between the borders of illusory and reality. As long as the lamp doesn’t get extinguished, I can reignite my Astral Sword Intent with a thought.”

“Exist between the borders of illusory and reality?” Dao Yang Holy Son muttered.

“You can think of it as him placing a lamp in my dream, and I lit it up. So unless someone extinguishes the lamp in my dream, my sword aura will never be extinguished,” Lin Yun replied.

The Dao Yang Holy Son widened his mouth with disbelief since it was a little too unbelievable. But after he came to his senses, his eyes were filled with envy for Lin Yun’s luck.

Lin Yun could guess what the Dao Yang Holy Son was thinking, but he didn’t give any explanation. Lightng the lamp was dangerous, and someone else might not be able to succeed. Even Lin Yun had placed his life on the line, so he could feel a chill run down his spine when thinking about it again. He changed the topic, “Even without the lamp, it’s hard to extinguish my current sword aura.”

“So you did it on purpose? Holy shit, you purposely revealed your flaw to me?” The Dao Yang Holy Son was shocked.

“I didn’t do it on purpose and was nearly defeated. I have still underestimated the power of Devour Dao,” Lin Yun smiled.

“This is only a spar, and you’re too serious.” the corner of the Dao Yang Holy Son’s lips twitched.

“Since we’re going to spar, we naturally have to give it our all. Scheming is also a part of strength, or I would’ve been long dead,” Lin Yun replied.

When the Dao Yang Holy Son heard that, he could feel a chill run down his spine. He turned his head to Lin Yun but couldn’t guess what Lin Yun had experienced for him to say such words. He asked, “What do you plan to do next?”

“I’ll most likely stay in the Heavenly Dao Sect and wait for my senior brother’s arrangements,” Lin Yun smiled with anticipation flashing in his eyes. After all, his senior brother could still be trusted. He asked, “What about you?”

Pointing at the pavilion, the Dao Yang Holy Son said, “Senior Tian Xing gave me this pavilion, so I will probably be here for a long time.”

“This is a huge treasure,” Lin Yun said enviously. He had only gone to the first level, but there were many teasures, including Yu Qingfeng’s notes. So he couldn’t imagine the other levels.

“You’re always welcome here,” the Dao Yang Holy Son laughed.

“I’ll thank you in advance, then,” Lin Yun said seriously.

“Haha, no need to be so polite,” the Dao Yang Holy Son casually replied. When they were about to leave, the Dao Yang Holy Son hesitated for a long time, then he called out to Lin Yun, “Hey, Holy Maiden Killer, don’t die out there. I will be on the Celestial Purging Mountain for many years, so I don’t want to hear that you have died once I’m out. We’ll fight again when I’m out!”

Lin Yun was stunned, but soon understood the Dao Yang Holy Son’s intentions. The latter had probably promised Tian Xing to bring the Emperor Sword back. He smiled, “Good luck! That sword doesn’t have a good temper. Don’t take too long, or you might still be here even after I become an Emperor.”

Looking at Lin Yun's back figure, the Dao Yang Holy Son smiled, “You and your unlucky mouth.”

“Dao Yang, let’s go back and read! I have to supervise you!” The Crane Fairy smiled as she hopped over.

The Dao Yang Holy Son’s smile disappeared, and he sighed, “I’m in my prime, but I can only look at you now. I have to bid farewell to all the beauties in the world now, and they’ll all be charmed by Flower Burial.”

Looking at the disdain on the Dao Yang Holy Son’s face, the Crane Fairy became furious, and she said with her cheeks puffed, “How dare you despise me! You tattered bastard!”

Dao Yang Holy Son’s hair was messy with an unkept beard and tattered clothes. Looking at him, no one would think he was a holy son but a beggar.

“What do you know? This is called temperament.” Dao Yang Holy Son patted the Crane Fairy’s head as he walked towards the pavilion, with the Crane Fairy following behind him as they argued.

At Indigothunder Peak, Lin Yun saw an unexpected guest there, instead of his senior brother.

The Indigothunder Peak Master respectfully accompanied this guest, and he smiled when he saw Lin Yun’s return, “Saint Elder, that brat is here.”

Lin Yun already saw Mu Xueling from afar, so he smiled, “It has been a long time.”

The Indigothunder Peak Master reprimanded, “Where are your manners? This is the Saint Elder of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. So pay your greetings!”

Mu Xueling didn’t stop the Indigothunder Peak Master, wanting to see Lin Yun pay his respects. This made Lin Yun’s mood sour. He was reluctant because they were too familiar with each other.

“What are you still waiting for? Hurry up!” The Indigothunder Peak Master said unhappily.

“Lin Yun pays his respects to the Saint Elder,” Lin Yun cupped his fists together since he couldn’t embarrass the Indigothunder Peak Master. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“That’s more like it. You guys talk while this Saint takes his leave. Let me know if you guys need anything,” the Indigothunder Peak Master patted Lin Yun’s shoulder with a smile as he left.

Lin Yun was about to welcome Mu Xueling into his courtyard when he suddenly noticed how the Indigothunder Peak Master addressed himself, and he turned around. It was a piece of good news that the Indigothunder Peak Master finally became a Saint. It should be about time because the latter was just one step away from becoming a Saint.

He wondered if his other martial brothers had reached the Saint Realm. His third senior brother shouldn’t be a problem. He might not be as talented as Ye Guhan, but he had his own pros. He was mainly worried about Feng Jue, who had always been taking a beating.

His master said that Feng Jue was the type who would catch up with everyone after reaching the Saint Realm. Jian Jingtian was extremely talented, and even Lin Yun couldn’t see through Jian Jingtian’s attainments in the sword now, but he didn’t know when Jian Jingtian could become a Saint with how he was trapped in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“Lin Yun, I have waited for you for a long time,” Mu Xueling said unhappily.

“Saint Elder, please come in,” Lin Yun said after coming to his senses.

].

“Hmph!” Mu Xueling snorted, and her face became a little better.

“I didn’t realize that the Saint Elder has quite the airs,” Lin Yun smiled as he poured a cup of tea for Mu Xueling.

“I’m here to deliver the Heavenly Dragon’s blood, so why can’t I receive your greetings?” Mu Xueling asked coldly. As she spoke, she took out a golden crystal bottle containing the Heavenly Dragon’s blood and placed it on the table.

Lin Yun squinted as his gaze fell onto the Heavenly Dragon’s blood. After all, this was a precious treasure, so he smiled, “Of course, you deserve my greetings. If you want, I can even greet you a hundred times, and I will greet you ten times if I see you in the future.”

Mu Xueling said scornfully, “You only have interest in your eyes, and you don’t look like Flower Burial now.”

Lin Yun took the golden crystal bottle and smiled, “This is the Heavenly Dragon’s blood. Aside from giving myself to you, I can do whatever you ask.”

His pride was nothing compared to the Heavenly Dragon’s blood. If he angered Mu Xueling, it would be a huge loss if she took back the Heavenly Dragon’s blood.

“Glib tongue,” Mu Xueling said coldly. She then told Lin Yun what happened with the Heavenly Dragon’s blood.

When Lin Yun finished hearing the story, his face changed because he nearly lost the Heavenly Dragon’s blood because of Tian Xuanzi. He asked, “Where is that official now?”

“Dead,” Mu Xueling replied. “She took the blame before I said anything. This was probably the order of the Empress to save Tian Xuanzi’s life.”

“What’s the origin of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain?” Lin Yun asked. After all, even the Empress had to give the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain face and return the Heavenly Dragon’s blood, not to mention killing a Saint, to apologize to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain.

“You want to know?” Mu Xueling asked, raising her head to look at Lin Yun.
