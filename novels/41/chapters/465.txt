Chapter 466 - Devilish Smile, Immortal Sword!

“This is His Highness’ true strength? He really ended the match in three moves, completely suppressing Lin Yun…”

“Not exactly. That’s because Lin Yun had exhausted too much of his strength from the three previous fights. This is also the reason why no one has succeeded in challenging Hell Mode.”

“That’s right. I share the same view. This is the reason why no one has succeeded in Hell Mode.”

“Yeah. We all saw how easily Lin Yun defeated Situ Yi, but it slowly became tougher when he ran into Trueorigin.”

“His Highness might seem arrogant, but he’s quite shrewd. He used the first two palms to test Lin Yun’s reserve. When he was sure that Lin Yun didn’t have much strength left, he used the third palm to give everyone an impression that he was invincible.”

“That’s right. If Lin Yun was in his top form, the outcome of this battle wouldn’t be so black and white.”

Qin Yu was terrifyingly strong, but Lin Yun had also proven his strength by defeating everyone and coming so far. Lin Yun wasn’t weak, but it was a pity that he came late for the competition. This unfortunate situation made everyone sigh out of pity.

They recalled how Lin Yun appeared when no one was expecting him to show up and how he defeated two titles to enter the best eight. His image had been imprinted in everyone’s heart. Although Qin Yu’s power had shocked everyone, they were also filled with admiration for Lin Yun.

“A mere sword slave dares to compete with me for the championship? What an idiot. Judge, I believe you can announce the results, right?” Qin Yu wore a smile as he looked at the deeply shocked judge.

The judge collected himself and landed on the stage while nodding his head, “Lin Yun has lost consciousness and he can no longer fight. According to the rules, you’ve won.”

“Then announce it,” smiled Qin Yu as he bowed slightly.

Everyone instantly recovered from their shock and looked at Qin Yu. In the end, Qin Yu still won the competition without any obstacles. After today, Qin Yu’s name would spread throughout the Great Qin Empire, becoming one of the strongest among the younger generation. At the same time, Qin Yu looked at the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s direction with a playful smile.

“Junior Brother!” Xin Yan gnashed her teeth. She could feel her heart being torn apart. If it wasn’t for Luo Feng pulling her down, she would’ve charged to the stage by now.

“I hereby announce the final winner of the competition, Fly-”

Suddenly, Qin Yu’s smile froze. The heaven and earth began to change and a terrifying aura was coming from the stage. A dazzling shine came from the depths of the crater and three pillars of light soared into the sky. The brimming vitality coming from the depth left everyone shocked.

“What’s going on?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“What’s with this powerful aura?”

“It’s origin cultivation!”

“It’s an expert’s origin cultivation!”

Many Violet Palace Realm experts were shocked. The three pillars of light were origin cultivations.

“H-how is that possible?” Wen Yanbo muttered to himself with shock filling his face. The origin cultivation was a lot stronger than he was, so one could imagine how precious the origins were.

By separating your origin, your chances of reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm would be affected as well as your lifespan. One origin cultivation represented ten years of lifespan, so three of these represented thirty years.

When the three pillars combined, a familiar sword buzz echoed out in the plaza.

“It’s Lin Yun!”

“Lin Yun hasn't lost!”

“Damn it! I actually wasted my tears!”

“Hell Mode still hasn’t ended. There’s still hope!” The entire plaza boiled with many people cheering out emotionally.

A figure flew out from the crater and landed on the stage. It was naturally Lin Yun.

“How can you declare my loss when I haven’t responded?” Lin Yun’s lips rose up as he looked at Qin Yu with a smile. His smile was filled with confidence and the aura emitting from him left everyone shocked. Not only had Lin Yun recovered all his strength, but his cultivation even improved to the quasi-Violet Palace Realm.

“You’re courting death!” Qin Yu’s face turned grim.

“Your Highness, you must be disappointed, right?” said Lin Yun with a smile.

“Hmph, so what if you’ve reached the quasi-Violet Palace Realm? I’ve reached this level two years ago, so your foundation is weaker than mine. Even if you crawl up to my level, I’ll just beat you down once more. This time, I won’t give you any extra chances!” A terrifying aura was unleashed by Qin Yu and he circulated the Profound Yang Art. He was like a blazing sun on the stage.

Lin Yun’s face changed slightly. He felt guilty for the three origins left to him by Guardian Plum. He initially didn’t want to use them because refining them was the same as refining Guardian Plum’s life span.

He swept his glance and saw Xin Yan on the guest seat with her reddened eyes. He also saw Li Wuyou wearing a smile with tears flowing down his cheeks. Even Luo Feng couldn't stop himself from tearing up. Then, he saw Lil’ Red, that goof, chuckling at the center of the plaza. Lin Yun also believed that Xin Jue was looking at him from the heavens right now…

Not only that, but he could also sense everyone’s attention on him from various parts of the capital. He knew that he wasn’t alone, so his heart blazed with fighting spirit. He wasn’t just fighting for himself. He wasn’t alone in this fight.

Torrential sword intent burst out from his body along with his aura that clashed with the aura coming from Qin Yu. With a bark, the Flower Burial Sword flew into his hand.

When Lin Yun and Qin Yu’s auras reached their pinnacle, they both disappeared from everyone’s view. In the next second, they both clashed in the deep crater at the center of the stage. Holding onto the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun threw out the Luminous Moon at full strength, severing Qin Yu’s attack into two.

“Die!” barked Qin Yu and his palm turned into a sharp blade that flew towards Lin Yun. In the blink of an eye, he threw out a total of nine palms that turned into nine blades.

Lin Yun’s face changed slightly, but he merely waved his sword to defend himself against the nine palms.

“Profound Yang Burst!” roared Qin Yu. The nine palms formed nine cauldrons that fused into a blazing cauldron in the sky. The cauldron looked so powerful that it felt as if it could devour everything in the world.

Lin Yun narrowed his eyes and he started waving the Flower Burial Sword. The afterimages of his sword formed an Iris Flower that blocked the flames coming from the cauldron.

“Rising Dawn!” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with cold light and he threw another palm out. His palm was like the first glimpse of dawn as it swiftly flew towards Lin Yun. The palm was fast, so fast that it couldn’t be seen by the naked eye.

But Lin Yun’s sword was faster. He stabbed out, executing Myriad Frost to freeze everything in the air. Lin Yun’s sword trembled lightly as the sword aura coming from it froze the incoming palm.

“Blazing Sun!” Qin Yu gnashed his teeth and threw another palm out.

Moon Reflection!

Lin Yun’s sword was like a mirror. When the palm landed on the mirror, the mirror cracked and Qin Yu’s attack vanished. The terrifying fluctuation swept out, forcing both Lin Yun and Qin Yu to retreat. They ended up landing at opposite edges of the stage.

“My turn,” smiled Lin Yun.

“So what? You think I’m afraid of you?!” barked Qin Yu.

“I’m just afraid that you might be startled,” smiled Lin Yun as the Flower Burial Sword began to buzz with excitement.

Without any signs, a sword buzz rang out that sounded like zither music. Before anyone could even react, a sword ray flew out, slicing through everything within its path.

The attack was fast, so before Qin Yu could even react, he was already struck by it. As he threw up a mouthful of blood, the entire stage was severed into two.

“Your Highness, why don’t you guess how much of my strength was used?” Lin Yun wore a smile. His smile was devilish and his sword was immortal.

“Xiantian sword intent!” Qin Yu looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.
