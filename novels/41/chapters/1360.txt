Chapter 1361 - Zhuge Qingyun!

With Senior Brother Feng Jue’s help, the journey out of the Profound Wither Island was a lot smoother. Facing some spatial storms that weren’t too powerful, Feng Jue could use his sword aura to forcibly charge through.

But throughout the entire journey, Feng Jue’s face was cold, and didn’t say a single word. Occasionally, Lin Yun would smile because it was hard for him to see Feng Jue in this state. In his impression, Feng Jue was always a friendly person and never showed his anger.

Feng Jue was unhappy as he grabbed onto Lin Yun shuttling through the spatial storms and coldly said, “You’re in such deep trouble and you can still smile?”

Hearing that, Lin Yun didn’t say a word and continued to smile.

“You brat, why are you still smiling? Don’t you know that you’re already in deep trouble?” Feng Jue raged. “Stop smiling! If you keep smiling, I…I also won’t be able to hold back my laughter.”

As Feng Jue spoke, he suddenly finally couldn’t continue his pretense and laughed out.

“Senior Brother, you’re a Samsara Edict Realm expert, so you have to control your expression well,” smiled Lin Yun.

Feng Jue glared at Lin Yun before he smiled, “You’re really bold this time. The Profound Sky Sect has been arrogant for so many years, and this is the first time they have suffered such a huge loss.”

“Even the Sword Sect can’t suppress the Profound Sky Sect?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone. In the Ancient Barren Domain, just how powerful was the Profound Sky Sect that even the Sword Sect had to avoid them?

“Watch out!” Feng Jue grabbed onto Lin Yun and avoided a spatial crack before he sighed, “Comparing foundations, our Sword Sect is naturally stronger. But Tian Xuanzi is too heaven-defying. He’s not even a thousand years old and he’s capable of competing with our master. Not only is he strong, but his disciples are also monsters. This is the reason why the Profound Sky Sect is able to rise so quickly.”

“It’s not a big issue that I crippled Qin Cang, right?” Lin Yun asked.

“You’re finally scared now. Haha. Well, no. Qin Cang is nothing, but the Great Saint Origin is the crucial key here. It won’t be easy for you to get away with that,” smiled Feng Jue.

“Then, what should we do?”

“What should we do? Fight! Our Sword Sect isn’t a pushover, either. Now that we have obtained the Great Saint Origin, there’s no reason for us to give it away,” said Feng Jue in a domineering tone.

“How many Samsara Edict Realm experts did the Profound Sky Sect send?” Lin Yun asked.

“One!”

Nodding his head, Lin Yun replied, “Phew. That’s still alright.”

“How is it still alright? It’s Zhuge Qingyun who came. He’s the strongest disciple under Tian Xuanzi.” Upon mentioning this person, Feng Jue recollected himself with fear lingering in his eyes.

The entire journey was then quiet as Feng Jue brought Lin Yun along and broke through the Profound Wither Island before landing on the island occupied by the Sword Sect. The Sword Sect’s Sword-Bearing Elder had been waiting there for a long time with a grave expression. It’s as though he was facing a powerful enemy.

When he landed on the ground, Lin Yun looked at Su Ziyao and the rest who were standing behind an old man. That old man had a terrifying sword aura, and his aura was as deep as the abyss and was even stronger than Senior Brother Feng Jue. This meant that the old man had long reached the Samsara Edict Realm, unlike Feng Jue, who had just reached the Samsara Edict Realm.

“This is the Sword Sect’s Sword-Bearing Elder, Lin Zhen. Senior Lin, he’s still alive and I brought him out,” said Feng Jue. Lin Zhen had a higher position and strength compared to him.

Cupping his hands together, Lin Yun greeted, “Greetings, Senior Brother Lin.”

“You obtained the Great Saint Origin?” Lin Zhen went straight into the topic, and Lin Yun nodded his head in response.

“Where is it, let me take a look.” Lin Zhen pursued.

“Hey, what are you trying to do?” Feng Jue’s face changed.

But Lin Zhen glared at Feng Jue before he turned to look at Lin Yun, “Friend, the Great Saint Origin is extremely important, and I believe there’s no need for me to tell you about the reasons.”

Lin Yun nodded because he also knew that the Great Saint Origin was useless to him right now. In the end, he could only hand it to the Sword Sect. At the very least, he could give it to Feng Jue or Jian Jingtian. He naturally knew that he would be in danger if he kept the Great Saint Origin to himself, since it would be a ticking time bomb.

Lin Yun also didn’t initially plan to keep it for himself. But the situation had changed now, so Lin Yun replied honestly, “I’m sorry but the Great Saint Origin has been sealed within my body by Senior Profound Wither. It’s one with my heart now. You can check my body if you don’t believe me.”

His words instantly caused a huge uproar. He briefly paused before he continued, “Uhh…I also refined a small portion of the Great Saint Origin and it’s also the reason why I have reached the Elysium Core Realm.”

This time, his words caused an even greater uproar.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Lin Zhen looked at Lin Yun’s chest with his eyes flickering.

“Hey, what are you thinking? Don’t tell me that you want to dig out my junior brother’s heart. If you dare, this daddy won’t let you go easily!” Feng Jue became anxious while looking at Lin Yun and stood before Lin Zhen.

Lin Zhen had disdain flashing through his pupils and replied, “No sense of seniority! Do you think you can do anything to me if I really wanted to make a move? I already know that he’ll join the Sword Sect, sooner or later. Get lost or I’ll beat you to death!”

Anyone could tell that the Sword-Bearing Elder didn’t like Feng Jue and wasn’t polite with his words. Lin Yun inwardly snickered when he heard that because it was all thanks to the Radiant Sword Saint that Feng Jue wasn’t beaten to death with his temper.

Otherwise, no one doubted that Feng Jue would be beaten every single day in the Sword Sect. To call himself ‘this daddy’ before the Sword-Bearing Elder, it would be weird if Feng Jue didn’t ask for a beating. Hearing what Lin Zhen said, Feng Jue instantly submitted and awkwardly smiled. “I’m just casually talking about it. It’s it because I’m anxious? Haha…”

“You’re not any younger than me.” Lin Zhen looked at Feng Jue unhappily before he turned to look at Lin Yun. “I believe you, but the Profound Wither Great Saint’s name is too great. Once it spreads throughout the Ancient Barren Domain, you will have to be careful because the sect also can’t protect you well. Let’s go, we shouldn’t stay here for too long.”

He was decisive and didn’t ask more about it after he got to know where the Great Saint Origin was located. Leading a group of people, they surrounded Lin Yun and left.

Lin Yun came over to Su Ziyao. After greeting Su Ziyao, he turned to look at Luo Shuyi. “Lady Luo, there’s a possibility that Tang Jing isn’t dead.”

Luo Shuyi was briefly stunned when he heard that before she turned to look at Lin Yun with disbelief and asked, “Are you serious?”

“Not 100%, but at least 90%. I personally saw his corpse being sucked into the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda, and there might be other secrets about it. I’ll tell you about the details when we’re safe,” said Lin Yun.

“Thank you, Young Master Lin,” replied Luo Shuyi.

“Please don’t say that. I’m the reason why you’re in this state, and this is what I should do. As for your face, I’ll find a way to resolve it,” said Lin Yun. He planned to ask Lil’ Purple if she had a way to restore Luo Shuyi’s face.

But Luo Shuyi smiled. “It’s fine. Big Sister Su said she has a way to obtain a Flawless Saint Pellet. So it’s a huge opportunity for me, instead.”

Lin Yun was shocked as he turned to look at Su Ziyao. But seeing how calm Su Ziyao was, it was as though this was nothing important to her.

“Let’s talk again after we make it out. I’m afraid that the Profound Sky Sect won’t let it go that easily,” said Su Ziyao. There was no question that the Profound Sky Sect definitely wouldn’t let them leave so easily. Furthermore, it was unsure if the other powerful sects would join hands. After all, it was the Great Saint Origin that they were talking about, and it was enough to make a Samsara Edict Realm expert tempted.

So it was a tough question if they could safely make it out of this situation. Lin Yun was also pretty optimistic about it because he knew that there was no spot for him since this was a fight amongst the powerhouses. Then again, there was no use for him to think too much about it because he would be instantly killed before a Samsara Edict Realm expert.

If the Sword Sect couldn’t protect him, then there was nothing he could do, either. If he was forced to a dead end, he could only summon the Firmament Saint Cloth to ensure the safety of Su Ziyao and the rest. But if possible, he really didn’t want to reveal the Firmament Saint Cloth. He knew that the value of the Firmament Saint Cloth was even greater than the Great Saint Origin and that even saints wouldn’t be able to hold back their temptation.

Just when the group was about to leave the island, a group of people streaked across the horizon and appeared before them. They were from the Profound Sky Sect, and their faces were ugly as they looked at Lin Yun. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Lin Yun, why are you leaving in such a hurry?” Before the Profound Sky Sect, the Dragon Pulse Realm experts coldly looked at Lin Zhen and Feng Jue.

“Get Zhuge Qingyun over to talk,” said Lin Zhen. He didn’t place the Dragon Pulse Realm experts in his eyes and this made the Dragon Pulse Realm experts unhappy. But there was nothing they could do because they didn’t have any courage to face Lin Zhen.

“It has been a long time, and your temper is still so violent.” Zhuge Qingyun walked out with a bamboo hat covering his head. At the same time, the powerhouses from the other powerful forces also appeared, looking from afar.

“Looks like there are a lot of old friends around. It appears that they won’t agree to it, even if I want to let you go,” smiled Zhuge Qingyun.

“What do you want?” Lin Zhen asked.

“Good!” Zhuge Qingyun replied. “I’ll be blatant about it, then. Leave that person behind and you guys can leave!”

Zhuge Qingyun pointed at Lin Yun and saw Feng Jue appearing before him with a flicker.

“Why are you pointing at me? If I want to leave, you still can’t stop me!” Feng Jue raged.

“Feng Jue, right? I have a pretty deep impression of you because you’re the stupidest disciple under the Radiant Sword Saint. You’re not strong, but you have a strong temper. I heard that because you’re too stupid, you’re kicked out of the Sword Sect,” said Zhuge Qingyun faintly.

When Feng Jue heard that, his face turned green because Zhuge Qingyun was too ruthless with his words.

“Haha, was I wrong?” Zhuge Qingyun smiled. “If you hadn’t reached the Samsara Edict Realm by luck, you wouldn’t even have the qualification to stand before him.”

Feng Jue flew into a rage when he said that. But just when he was about to speak, Lin Zhen stopped him and coldly looked at Zhuge Qingyun, “I’m sorry that Lin Yun was a little too ruthless against Qin Cang. But this is a grudge between the juniors, and we usually leave it to the younger generations to deal with it amongst themselves.”

“That’s right. That’s what Saint Sovereign teaches us as well. If Qin Cang is killed, he can only blame himself for being too weak. But…” Zhuge Qingyun’s expression turned cold and said, “How long are you still going to keep acting? If he doesn’t hand over the Great Saint Origin today, not a single one of you can leave. Don’t force me to make a move and make the Sword Sect’s Sword-Bearing Elder kneel before me!”
