Chapter 2213: Favor Of Beauties Was The Hardest To Accept

“I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!” Lil’ Purple said in a domineering tone.

Even someone like Ye Guhan was stumped when he heard that long title. What did the four seas mean? Was it referring to the four forbidden seas outside the Kunlun Realm? So what about the eight barrens? Thirty-six heavens made sense, but what did the seventy-two earths mean?

Ye Guhan looked at Lil’ Purple with uncertainty, and he couldn’t help smiling when he noticed that there wasn’t any aura of the Phoenix Bloodline. He smiled, “The Divine Phoenix Clan? Can it be that you’re a pure-blooded phoenix? Haha, interesting. But the Divine Phoenix Mountain does have humans possessing the phoenix bloodline.”

He naturally wouldn’t believe what Lil’ Purple said, so he smiled, “If you’re the Heavenly Slaughter Empress, I would be the Sword God’s reincarnation.”

“Hmph, I can’t be bothered with a mortal like you. This empress can even kill a Sword God with a breath of divine flames.” Lil’ Purple pouted.

“Hahaha!” Ye Guhan laughed and continued, “Alright, I won’t ask you anymore.”

He could roughly sense Lil’ Purple’s identity. She must be an ancient artifact spirit or a sword spirit. With that, the doubts about Lil’ Purple’s identity had ended here. To him, Lin Yun’s secrets didn’t concern him because everyone had their own secrets.

“What about the Profound Sky Canon?” Lin Yun asked, unwilling to give up.

“Let’s talk about it as we walk,” Ye Guhan smiled, not intending to hide it from Lin Yun.

“You can talk about it?” Lin Yun was shocked because he thought it would be a sensitive topic.

“Well, you’re my beloved junior brother.” Ye Guhan chewed on the Divine Dragon Fruit as he smiled at Lin Yun, but his smile made Lin Yun feel goosebumps.

“Don’t! Don’t be so cheesy,” Lin Yun said.

“Hahaha! You’re not even afraid of Saint Lords, but you’re afraid of teasing. Junior Brother, it looks like you still have a lot of room for growth,” Ye Guhan laughed. As they walked to Indigothunder Peak, Ye Guhan began to talk about the Profound Sky Canon’s story.

“Back when we were the Twin Stars of the Eastern Desolation… we could be considered friends. Our master nearly took him in as a disciple as well. We had been competing with each other, but we had our divergences and acknowledgments. You should know about them. Ultimately, he wanted to complete the Profound Sky Canon and discussed it with me for a long time. I didn’t believe it initially, but he really managed to complete it,” Ye Guhan sighed.

“So, Senior Brother also helped complete the Profound Sky Canon?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“Not exactly,” Ye Guhan shook his head.

Lin Yun asked, “But senior brother managed to combine the Profound Sky Canon and Great Profound Sword Canon, which is something that even Tian Xuanzi can’t accomplish, right?”

“Strictly speaking, it’s not a true combination, and I used a small trick,” Ye Guhan said.

Lin Yun recalled it, and realized that it didn’t really seem to be a perfect combination.

They swiftly returned to Indigothunder Peak, and everyone was still shocked as they tried to digest the news.

“I’ll guard outside. The Serene Dust Great Saint might’ve treated your injuries, but you better consolidate it yourself,” Ye Guhan said.

“Okay.” Lin Yun had that intention as well. But there was something that needed to be resolved.

Lin Yun formed the Iris Saint Seal and the sword box hovered before him. When the Iris Flower patterns ignited on the sword box, a door opened, which was the entrance of the Iris Secret Realm.

After witnessing the power of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. Lin Yun started to wonder if the Iris Sword Box was a time-space treasure.

When he and Lil’ Purple entered the Iris Secret Realm, Lil’ Purple released the two Sovereign Divine Runes and thunderstorms began to fill up this secret realm.

Lil’ Purple sat with her eyes closed and radiated a powerful pressure. When the two Sovereign Divine Runes were finally released, Lil’ Purple breathed a sigh of relief and she opened her eyes.

“Why didn’t you refine them since the Sovereign Divine Runes are so powerful?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s good if I can refine them. But with my current cultivation, who knows if I can refine the Sovereign Divine Runes or if it would be the other way round,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Oh?” Lin Yun was surprised as Lil’ Purple continued to explain to him. The Sovereign Divine Runes were treasures that could grow by themselves, like elixirs and beasts. So, they would be absorbing your energy while you’re refining them. Once the Sovereign Divine Runes have recovered to their pinnacle, they would have intelligence, and you might be consumed by them instead.

“So… what should I do with the Solar Divine Rune within my body?” Lin Yun asked.

“Let’s extract it. It’s like a ticking bomb. Think of the Nine Lotus Diagram back then; that thing was also dangerous, and it would have been a ticking bomb if it was left within your body,” Lil’ Purple said.

“I’m fine with that, but what’s the situation with Bai Shuying!?” Lin Yun was more concerned with that question.

Mentioning Bai Shuying, Lil’ Purple had shock reflected in her eyes, and she said, “That lass is a little terrifying. Her physique isn’t a natal saint physique but a natal divine physique!”

Lin Yun had heard about it before, and his emotions fluctuated when he heard about it again. He possessed an acquired divine physique, and it was already so powerful. So he could only imagine how terrifying a natal divine physique would be.

“Hers isn’t the Absolute Yang Divine Physique, but the Great Solar Divine Physique that was rare even in ancient times. One must know that a divine physique represents a peerless Emperor, and it would be unimaginable if they managed to reach the Deity Realm,” Lil’ Purple said. “The Great Solar Divine Physique that was the strongest in history could even be compared to the Ancestral Deity and Sword Ancestor.”

“Isn’t that good news?” Lin Yun frowned.

“But this divine physique has never appeared on a woman since that woman would generally be stillborn. The birth of a natal divine physique is dangerous, not to mention her condition. There is no way she could have been born,” Lil’ Purple said. “So I was curious about her origins, and her divine physique is flawed. She needs the Solar Divine Rune to restrain and the Lunar Divine Rune to tune. The Solar Divine Rune is used to suppress the divinity, reducing it to the level of a saint physique.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered, before he said, “Hurry up and extract it from me, then. Let’s give it back to her.”

“I do have a way, and we might not necessarily need to return the Solar Divine Rune,” Lil’ Purple said.

“You discuss that with the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.” Lin Yun naturally wanted the Sovereign Divine Rune and wanted to see how powerful the Iris Sword Box would be when all the Sovereign Divine Runes were gathered. He wouldn’t hesitate to take it if it didn’t involve Bai Shuying’s life.

“Alright, I’ll think of a way. But…” Lil’ Purple winked, and she smiled, “You’re really a scumbag. It turns out that the man Bai Shuying was thinking of was you, and you’re muddle-headed.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered, then said, “I’m not muddle-headed. I had really not seen her before I came to the Heavenly Dao Sect, and I only fought with the clone she left behind when challenging the Elysium Core Realm.”

“Are you serious about that? I don’t believe you,” Lil’ Purple said.

“I…” Just when Lin Yun opened his mouth, he suddenly thought of something and lowered his voice, “Can it be?”

“So you two have an agreement?” Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts for a long time before he sighed. He recalled that when he defeated Bai Shuying’s clone, her clone told him to come to the Heavenly Dao Sect if he had an opportunity. Lin Yun remembered that he agreed to it back then, but he didn’t think much of it since so many things happened after that, especially the battle outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield. After that, he tossed the agreement to the back of his mind, and only remembered that someone called Bai Shuying existed.

He never expected that Bai Shuying wouldn’t be able to let him go when they only unofficially met once.

“I see.” After hearing Lin Yun’s story, Lil’ Purple sneaked a peek at Lin Yun and said, “You’re pretty handsome, and your temperament is also acceptable. In addition to your name spreading far and wide, her interest in you probably increased.

“Bai Shuying might seem cold and indifferent against other men, but it turns out she has fancied you…”

“Let’s extract the Solar Divine Rune first,” Lin Yun said, interrupting Lil’ Purple.

.

When Lil’ Purple extracted the Solar Divine Rune a few minutes later, the process wasn’t smooth because the Solar Divine Rune was reluctant to leave since it was addicted to Lin Yun’s powerful vitality. But it was fortunate that Lil’ Purple had various means and managed to extract the Solar Divine Rune safely and sealed it.

“Alright. I’ll go and look for the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint now.” Lil’ Purple knew she couldn’t delay this matter, and that nothing must happen to Bai Shuying.

“Wait up.” But just when Lil’ Purple was about to leave, Lin Yun called out to her, and said, “Empress, I have a favor to ask of you.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“What is it?”

“If possible, try and use your method to help Bai Shuying, not the Solar Divine Rune,” Lin Yun said.

“Mhm?” Lil’ Purple was baffled. She knew Lin Yun wasn’t greedy, and that he might even be willing to give away the two Sovereign Divine Runes that involved Bai Shuying’s life. Back then, when they knew each other, Lin Yun was already willing to give her the Azure Dragon King Bone, or she couldn’t manifest a body for herself. So why did he suddenly say that when it came to Bai Shuying?

Lil’ Purple soon figured it out, and she looked at Lin Yun deeply, “I got it.”

Lin Yun nodded and no longer said anything about it.
